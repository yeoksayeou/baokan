<h3>再論菲島提早獨立問題</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>一九三五年之十一月。菲列賓半獨立政府成立。期於一九四六年之七月四日。正式宣告獨立。十年以內。菲島雖有自治之政府。然外交軍事等大權。司法立法諸工作。均受華盛頓政府之限制。在金融與經濟方面。受限制更大。一年以來。菲島政治家深覺獨立難關重重。環境惡劣。乃於前月由菲島總統奎松率代表團至美。向羅斯福總統請求改進美菲二邦之各種關係。近者報章相傳。菲總統已提出於明年或一九三八年實現菲列賓獨立之議。菲人有此要求。其原因為何。將有何結果。此吾國人所應關心之問題也。試再一論之。</p>
<p>菲島現在所感之困難問題。經濟也。社會也。國防也。外交也。而經濟問題尤為嚴重。當美國佔領菲島之初。卽以菲島為美國之原料供給所與製造品之市塲。糖•椰子油•麻•烟草等。均美國所需要。於是菲島產業。集中於此諸物。美菲兩地。當時無關稅之阻。而美國對於外國。則嚴築關稅壁壘。故糖油諸物。在美價昂。菲島之國民經濟。遂依賴於美國。以糖油之所得。購美國之棉布等。後以美國國內之糖業油業資本家。厭菲島之爭奪美國糖油市塲。乃運動議員。鼓吹菲島獨立。使美國之關稅壁壘。應用於菲島來貨。半獨立時期。菲糖入口。無稅者限八十五萬頓。椰子油進口。無稅者限二十萬頓。此外均漸漸加稅。漸增至一九四〇年。當納美國法定之全稅。易言之。卽漸漸使菲島失去國民經濟所依賴之市塲。而陷於孤立無援之域也。</p>
<p>至於半獨立期內。國運入菲島之物概不納稅。故菲島市塲。仍為美國所佔有。菲島現在外交。直接受美政府之監督與指揮。而一切關稅立法及對外貿易條約。須經美國大總統之批准。故菲島無法與他國訂立有利之關稅條約。菲島亦無以國內市塲與他國市塲互相交換之自由。且國際糖油之價狂跌。惟美國一隅以關稅故。價格特高。成本甚貴之菲糖。無法在國際市塲與爪哇古巴之糖相競。菲島財政收入。百分之六十賴於糖業。菲島之糖。百分之九十九。本依美國市塲為生。糖無出路。卽菲島之國民經濟無出路。使美國不允予設法。則糖業失敗。農工失業。菲島必將陷於古巴之內亂狀况。且菲政府無借債等財權。一切受美國之限制。在此半獨立情形之下。義務有餘。權利不足。論自由不足以應付環境。論實力不足以建樹獨立。此菲島政治家之所以要求提前獨立。而美國當局。亦允為考慮者也。</p>
<p>雖然。菲列賓問題。决非提前獨立可以解决。而菲列賓之困難。亦决非經濟一端也。菲島經濟。無獨立自存之資格。其地富源雖有。然决不是以維持一完全獨立之國家。且基本工農業之建設。非現在菲島資力人力之所能勝。菲島地處遠東最危險之環境中。日本覬覦此島。已非一日。經濟之侵略。更為可驚。現日本棉布。已駸駸然代替美國棉布。為菲人之衣著矣。日本在菲島南部之大威（Davao）地域之殖民墾闢。已使此區域成為日本之一縣。長此以往。菲島必成為日本之囊中物。故目前菲人以前途黯淡。出路不佳。竟有以習日文學和俗。準備投入日本之懷抱者。其趨勢不難想像也。</p>
<p>現美國對於菲島之國防。仍負責任。奎松總統不惜巨資。與美國之軍事專家。戮力完成菲島之訪禦計劃。美國以菲島為其遠東最重要根據地。故未嘗等閒視之。卽獨立以後。美國之海軍根據地。仍不放。棄故一旦遠東有事。菲島被犯。美國不能不捲入戰爭之漩渦。美國將放棄遠東乎。則不但應卽日予菲島獨立。且應根本改變其國策。卽日本吞併菲島。恐亦只有視若無覩。美國如不退出遠東。則於菲島之經濟問題。當予援助。且應積極準備。勿作自私及退編之圖。魚與熊掌。不可得而兼。歧路亡羊。願美菲當局熟思之也。</p>
<h3>日本衆議院討論華北走私問題</h3>
<p>一宮主張協助我國緝私　外相欲與關稅問題同議</p>
<p>［南京］今日衆議院預算大會、自午前十時三十八分開會、首由政友會太田正孝氏質間、現在寄居滿洲之日本人、其敎育方針若何、</p>
<p>佐藤外相答、遵照敎育勅語之主旨、將滿洲之特殊事情、加以考慮而敎育之、</p>
<p>太田問、關於在滬舉行之中日貿易協會、以余所見、其成效期待甚薄、政府具有相當之期待否、</p>
<p>外相答、兩國之實業巨子個人請求親睦、自有必要、在深切兩國國情之理解上、認為頗有意義、該使節一行當能詳詢實情而歸、至於現內閣之對華方針、擬於政治折衝以前、欲圖經濟上與文化上之提携、想中國方面甚為了解者也、</p>
<p>太田問、外相所謂外交基本工作、對於華北華南、是否有分別考慮之必要、</p>
<p>外相答、華北與華中華南當然須分別考慮、余所謂基本工作、據云似乎或將代以幣原外交、但余根據現在之情勢、正在考慮並非所謂積極的或消極的、未便一概而論者也、</p>
<p>太田問、日本方面對於中國、將由農業國進展至工業國之五年計劃、有無任何呼應之方法、又余認為中國改革幣制、業經獲得相當成功、卽使將軍備•國內經濟•容共等等情形、加入考慮、而中國之通貨、尚可認為表示其比較堅實之步調、對於此事、我國財政與銀行有無處分現銀之意、</p>
<p>外相答、對於中國經濟建設五年計劃、我方自應盡量援助、至處分現銀問題當與藏相所述者相同、應任各銀行之自由、</p>
<p>太田問、為日華提携起見、余以為不得不觸及關稅問題、尊見若何、</p>
<p>外相答、對華為輸出國產品與機械類及其他貨物起見、自應考慮輸出保障法之改正等節、而因交通發達之關係、材料物品需要亦多、亦當考慮、故於改正關稅自應努力、</p>
<p>太田問、關於華北之經濟外交、余認為尚須充分活動、因此對於投資與匯兌管理法之關係須極力使之圓滑、尊見以為若何、又如華北之特種貿易狀况以及其他各節亦請說明、</p>
<p>外相答、我國對華北投資、當為中國所歡迎者、但以投資於何種產業為宜、此事當與大藏當局協力研究、至於特種貿易、日本雖非直接關係、而於日本對華貿易上、則不無關係、故現正愼重考慮、</p>
<p>［東京］衆議院豫算總會午後一時半繼續開會、一宮房次郎（民）問、關於取締華北之特殊貿易、我國協助中國、非僅為日華經濟提携之前提條件、卽對世界亦可謂表示我國之光明態度、尊見以為若何、</p>
<p>外相答、對於日華經濟提携、余表同感、但經濟提携、當與政治上之提携、綜合考慮、關於華北之特殊貿易、乃為冀東政權本身之問題、日本不應講論、唯我國須將中國之關稅問題、合行考慮、故非愼重研究不可、</p>
<p>一宮問、對華信用諸欵、可否設立、</p>
<p>外相答、日華經濟關係之改善、當以設立信用欵項為前提條件、余對於此種具體問題、正與關係閣僚商議之中、七時五分休息（二十三日同盟電）</p>

<h3>西藏大格西喜饒嘉錯抵滬</h3>
<p>應聘來京為五大學講學</p>
<p>本報特寫中央當局為溝通藏漢文化起見、特請西藏哲帮寺大格西（博士譯稱）喜饒嘉錯大師（前譯為西丹加索）來京為中央•北平•武漢•中山•清華•五大學講學、由監察委員黎丹氏所組之蒙藏巡禮團及其弟子觀巴色呼圖克圖•格西噶桑嘉錯•達賴喇嘛之古嘉圖丹南卓•監察委員黎丹等二十一人、乘英輪嘉哈那號於前晚抵灑、喜氏因一路勞頓、故暫在滬休息一日、各方因喜氏此來、甚為重視、故往訪者終日不絕、而以記者團往訪為尤多、喜大師•黎委員竟未能稍事休息、黎氏秘書楊質夫氏尤為忙碌、旣為大師翻譯、又與各報記者接談、幾無睱𠷳、筆者於楊氏百忙之睱、得以盡情相告、茲將所談錄誌於後、</p>
<h3>喜饒嘉錯氏</h3>
<p>喜氏略歷　喜饒嘉錯大師、原籍青海、自幼卽抵西藏、為西藏著名大師、文章道德素為藏人所祟、有弟子一萬餘人、名滿全藏、卽在世界上亦有相當地位、</p>
<p>旅途日程　　二月八日、由西藏起程、二月廿四日到達印度、二十八日由印度乘船、三月十六日到香港、十九日由香港開船、前日到滬、行期共一個半月有餘、</p>
<h3>黎丹氏</h3>
<p>途遇外賓　喜氏此次晋京、由西藏經過印度噶倫堡時、有英國藏事專家麥克唐納前來拜訪、當到加爾各答時、印度國際大學特開歡迎會、請往參觀該校、並受印度佛教團體麻哈菩提社諸比丘尼請往說法、再在佛陀加耶（該地名金剛座、為釋迦佛成道處）朝覲聖蹟由加埠上船時、有滿清光緒甲辰年率英遠征軍入藏之英人佛蘭斯榮赫鵬（Sir　Francis　YoungHusband）躬自上船拜訪、並語嘉氏云、“我們此次組織旅行會來印度、專為考求佛法而來、因為現今世界、干戈擾攘、無有安日、匪宣揚佛教、不足以挽救浩刼、故深願廣宏佛法、以救世界、此次大格西能到英倫一行、實揚佛法、不勝祈禱”云云、同時有美國學者畢納德（Mr.Theos.　C·　Bernared）亦到船請見、亦謂、“美國現在亦極尊崇佛法、希望大格西到美國一行、廣宏佛法、以利衆生”云云、格西答謂、“我亦願向貴國一行、二公此來、誠為善緣、因不害衆生一語、不特為世界和平、卽我佛說法、亦不過此、我無論在西藏、在中國、家鄉說法時、亦以此為一定不移之宗旨、貴國我久想一行、實因事未能一往、引以為憾”云云、至此遂留通信處、希望時常通信而去、</p>
<p>大師宣講　各報記者羣請喜饒嘉錯大師、講一段關於西藏文化的歷史、大師整理身上黃袍坐下、講着藏語、由楊質夫氏翻譯、茲錄大意如後</p>
<p>漢藏關係　佛教自釋迦佛應化、先興於印度、故印度可謂佛教發祥地、漢時輸入中國、唐時輸入西藏、西藏輸入佛教之始、就是中國佛教興盛之時、宋朝以後、中國佛教漸衰、西藏佛教復興、元初聘西藏薩嘉班慶、及其姪帕克巴諸人、遂與薩迦派發生關係、元末、聘請哈立麻等、又興迦居派發生關係、明初、西藏新派（黃教佛教振興、明成祖曾聘新派祖師宗喀巴大師、但大師未能親到、派大弟子釋迦耶喜前來、遂與新派發生關係、清初、五世達賴來中國、與西藏新派關係更深、而政治上亦聯為一氣、到現在六百年如同一日、民國成立、西藏學者來內地、雖為數不少、正式受中央聘者、自本人始、故本人實可謂第一人、此佛教與漢藏關係之大略情形、</p>
<p>意義重大　此次我受中央之請、覺得有絕大之意義、因自元初以來、迄至清末、皆為“帝師”或“國師”、因藏人自到內地、居於宮禁、為一人說法、關係極小、此次係為中央命為國立五大學講學、實為溝通藏漢文化、本人雖為無學之士、今後自己當本努力宣揚為宗旨、</p>
<p>並非代表　本埠各報載我為西藏熱振呼圖克圖之代表、不勝詫異、此種消息、不但非為事實、本人亦未夢想及此、請大家注意此點、</p>
<p>黎氏談話　筆者於大師講畢、復叩詢監察委員黎丹氏西行情形、黎氏今年已六十七歲、精神康健異常、據談、所組蒙藏巡禮團、連旅程共有四年、去時、由甘肅•青海•至西藏、歷時一年、路經數百里無人烟、由甘肅至西藏、足有三月、旅途幸好、有牲口代步、抵藏後、卽從事與喜饒嘉錯研究西藏文化、（餘從略）</p>

<p>自殺殞生　動機不明、當開庭時、中興女士同寓而為女土鐘情之基泊氏到庭作證、謂女士自殺前兩星期、渠曾與討論二人之婚姻事、渠告以目下不能成婚之理由、而决計作罷、女士亦表同情、渠</p>
<p>最後一次　見女士乃在三月十日晚十時三十分、女士至渠室中閒談、並未有何爭辯、惟渠於談話時、曾言及渠不如遷移、以便彼此少見面、女士不肯、於是渠乃决計留居、女士離室時、意態如常云云、於是海恩斯氏宣稱、</p>
<p>事無多疑　者、死者乃於三月十一日晚七時三十分飲來沙而藥水、又可明白者、死者殊愛基泊氏、是夜或曾沉思及此、乃决定主意、以旣不能與之成婚、則不值生存於世、但就證人之供詞而論、死時究於</p>
<p>何種心思　殊難斷定、海恩斯氏宣布退庭後一分鐘、又忿然發言曰、社會不仁善之部份、對於女土死時之情狀、頗多閒言、但因此種惡意之言詞、意在中傷死者之榮譽、故今專為公道起見、宜作聲明者、卽此種讕言、毫無醫學上之明證是也、</p>

<h3>現代政治與中國（續）</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>第三是經騐加多。政黨政治的內閣是：你負幾天責，我又來負幾天責，這樣互相消長勾心斗角的，經騐固然增多，眞正的政治的經騐就要蒙到極大的損害了。比如法國的內閣最多不過十個月，通常僅二三月就坍台，這樣欲求其有計劃有經騐當然是不可能的。</p>
<p>第四是技術加精，政治技術同其他技術一樣的，如今天負一天責，明天又坍台，自然得不到精良的技術。誰也知道：駕輕車走熟路是比較的快。熟能生巧也是一種定論。所以要求技術加精，就要負責時候多，不要今天上台，明天下台。</p>
<p>第五是時間加快。多黨政治是彼此牽制，彼此會議，彼此商討，虛耗時間，使應作之事停止。這樣，國家一切事業便受大害，尤其是軍事要遭受莫大的失敗，這種情形各國已看出來，所以為了要提高效能，便由重法治趨於重人治。　　　　最後講到除去牽制的弊害。各同志都了解政治是靠着力量的推動，當然也就知道多黨政治是力量分散。這一集團與那一集團各不相謀，這是不是力量分散？在這鬥爭的現世界中，適不適用？</p>
<p>其次力量的對消，在分權政治下，你那樣作，我這樣作，力量費了，政治不向前，且發生力量牽制，因為你運用你的力量時，我還要妨害你，我運用我的力量時，你又來加以妨害。這樣政黨政治不是力量分散，力量對消，力量牽制嗎？隨時隨地勾心洽角，想消滅人家力量，增加自己力量，結果少數人爭地位，可是國家民族的前途被葬送了。各國看出了這個毛病，所以要糾正，才有今天的趨勢，產生今天的政治形態與實質。　　這五點是今天政治演變的重要原因。我們了解這五點卽可知政治的演變，是鬥爭的激烈之所要求的迫切的準備與緊急的措置的一種必然性。（未完）</p>
<h3>曹樹銘演講蘇聯的國防（續）</h3>
<p>㊀所有蘇聯軍用品、如槍•砲•子彈•坦克•轟炸機•驅逐機•潛水艇•魚雷艇等等都是自造、自給、沒有一件是外國貨、在第一次五年計劃期間、這種供給只不過在量的方面、有相當的注意和成就、到了現在、已經進一步在質的方面、力求其精善美、併且已大大的成就了、</p>
<p>㊁因為軍事上的設備、大如槍•砲•坦克•戰機•小如炸藥•鏍鏇•都各有其重要性和秘密性、如果這類東西都由外國買來、未必能買到極精的和極新的、同時那出賣的一國、或數國便可以知道你國防上的實力、知道你國防上的秘密、說一句極低限度的話、就不能防禦那個出賣軍火給你的國家、蘇聯當局知道這一點的重要、所以自造自給、一面保守軍力的秘密、一面不受任何外國的牽制、同時、因為發展重工業的緣故、實際上養成了大批專門技術人材、并且解決了大部份勞工問題、這一點在國防上更有眞實的意義、請諸位特別注意、</p>
<p>㊂蘇聯當局、知道交通和軍事的密切關係、對於交通方面、如未築鐵路的處所便添築鐵路或公路、已築鐵路的處所、或加築雙軌、或加築平行線的公路、又在展長已有的運河、或是另造新的運河、聯絡水上交通、至於民用航線的延長和開拓、更是不遺餘力的發展着、蘇聯對於交通的建設、簡直是一日千里、要知道就軍事言、交通發達才能便於動員、便於運輸在國防上實在有極重要的意義總之蘇聯軍事防備、截至現在已有相當的雄厚實力一方面在繼續邁進之中、一方面蘇聯當局以和平、以武力捍衛和平的口號、在國際上大喊着、因為和平不是空洞的諾言、要靠實力來做準備、實力充足、那麼、談和平才有力量、和平才能實現、這正是蘇聯一面力事整軍、一面高唱和平的微妙作用所在呢、第二•政治、蘇聯的政治在國防上有極重大的意義、我們都知道蘇聯是以共產主義立國的、現在在蘇聯、政治上、只有在列寗和史丹林指導之下的共產黨把握政權、（未完）</p>

<p>劉湛恩詞　次由劉湛恩博士演詞、第一點要想完成真正統一國家、不但要政治統一、軍令統一、財政統一、而有貴乎精神統一、如何去實施精神統一先决條件先從公民訓練入手、並提出公訓具體目標五項、第二點、希望全國民衆一致團結起來、效法日俄德義各國把全國民衆不分士農工商、不論男女老幼、一齊組織起來全國總動員、先從每個家庭、作公訓起點、然後推廣四萬五千萬力量去努力救國云、</p>
<p>告市民書　全市的父老兄弟姊妹們、統一救國的呼聲、隨着民國二十六年到來了、看呵、全國上下除掉“封建的殘餘軍閥”除掉“共匪”以及所謂“人民陣綫”或“聯合陳綫”除掉為敵人作虎倀傀儡“漢奸”如溥儀殷汝耕等喪心病狂之徒外、最大多數的中華民國的國民誰不對於統一救國的口號表示歡欣鼓舞的贊成和擁護呵、是的、統一救國是我們人人所切盼的、是我們中國所急需的、是人同此心的、可是我們不要當這是一個空的口號、空空喊着而已、我們要永久的印在心頭、我們要切實的篤信奉行、我們要勇毅的促其實現、我們更要相信這是我們民族生命所寄託的運動、我們要知道能統一才能救國、能切實統一救國我們的民族才能安全的生存、為了希望人人永久的不忘與切實的奉行、本館才有這次統一救國運動宣傳週的舉行、至於為什麼要統一救國怎樣實現統一救國願略貢所見於全市同胞之前、㊀為什麼要統一救國、歷史現階段的事實告訴我們一九三六年的危機算是勉勉强强的過去了、一九二七年不是和平之年、這怕是誰都不能否認的事實吧、各帝國主義者皆在那裹摩拳擦掌拚命的擴軍、準備那第二次對弱小民族施行大屠殺的工作、尤其是我們的强鄰、更在那明敲暗算不斷的向我們進攻、我們處於這種環境、要知道唯有禦侮抗敵和努力準備應付這當前的第二次世界大戰才可以保持我民族的生存和人民的生命、這是毫無疑義而且是我們中國民族每一個國民當前唯一的使命、要抗敵禦侮、要應付非常時期的到來、先决的條件必須先要達到全國軍令與政令眞正的統一、然後政府才能進一步謀全國經濟的建設與交通的完成、有了軍令政令的統一、經濟交通建設的完成、然後國力充實才能談禦侮抗敵救亡和圖存、所以我們目前唯一的救國途徑、便是“統一運動”、㊁怎樣實現統一救國、非統一不能“救國”欲“救國”必先“統一”、這是擺在我們眼前的事實、不過怎樣去實現統一救國、這個問題、現在我們謹提出三點、盼望我全市民衆在這個共同的目標下、大家一齊來實踐、以完成統一救國的偉業、走上民族復興的途徑、第一、堅確信仰、中國國民黨總理孫中山先生昭示我們的三民主義、不但是救中國的唯一主義、而且是救世界的主義、因此我們應該一致認識三民主義、共同信仰三民主義、以實現三民主義化的新中國、作我們努力統一救國運動的唯一對象、我們要拿三民主義去排斥其他主義、我們要拿三民主義去解釋一切現象、能如此、才能有一個同一的共信、有了同一的共信、然後思想才能統一、才能在同一的目標之下共同努力完成救國的偉業、什麼人民陣綫、聯合陣綫、那都是日暮窮途的共匪騙人的鬼話、煽惑人民破壞統一、使國家民族走入滅亡的毒計、第二、擁護領袖、中外的歷史都告訴我們、一個民族的興盛無一不在羣衆服從民族領袖、以一致的行動、才建立絕大的功業、古時是這樣現在也是這樣、看、德國有希特勒、意國有墨索里尼、人民一致擁護、所以能稱雄歐洲、我們經過了上次西安事變、看見朝野上下一致擁護領袖的心理、便證明了我們的國家現在已有了最高領袖、並且是國家民族生命所寄託、從此以後、我們應竭誠的擁護這位最高領袖—蔣委員長—把我們一己所有的力量都獻給國家、使我們最高領袖有運用全國人民的力量去完成禦侮抗敵、復興民族的偉業、第三、生活改善、我們知道一個民族的復興、他的人民生活習慣、要佔重要的成份、試看一個强盛的國家、他的民族生活、必然是充滿了一種蓬蓬勃勃的朝氣、反顧我國的人民、過去大都暮氣沉沉、不是貧窮愚弱便是浪漫奢侈、以這樣的民族精神、怎樣能擔當救國的偉業呢、因此要想能負起這禦侮抗敵復興民族的責任、我們生活的改善、實屬當務之急、改善生活的要策、便是全國上下一面一致實行新生活、一面要努力經濟建設、使我們在心理上、有充實的精神、在物質上有豐富的供給、這種精神生活和物質生活的改善就是實際的充實國力、就可以在一個最高領袖領導之下、擔起救亡圖存復興民族的使命、最後本館願以十二萬分的誠意、希望全市的同胞認清當前的國勢、一致站在統一救國的旗幟下、積極的努力統一救國運動、做全國民族的前驅、我們更十二萬分相信、只要統一運動完成、那救國的工作、一定可以完成、</p>

<h3>標金缺乏供給</h3>
<p>—但行盤祇回好一角—</p>
<p>金市昨初以海外銀市英美俱升、滙兌略縮、倫敦生金勿動、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、標準標金價仍為一一五七元八角、晨開微高、開後因供方缺乏、以致檯面轉涸、逐漸微升、後市初堅後疲、令將一天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開塲一一五元七角、較前收升起一角、大豐恒•生源永•福順•納條、滙豐銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、以及白銀平衡稅升一分均無影響、塲內賣方僅有恒餘一家、而升至五元九角、午收為一一五五元九角、</p>
<p>後市開盤一一五六元、生源永雖進、恒餘大德成仍售而不支、收盤為一一五五元七角、天間計有三角掙扎、結果微升一角、　　結價以中央銀行標準金價仍掛一一五七元八角、照收盤價言、約撳二元餘、現貨市况平穩、天津貸照加十三元半、烚赤買價十一元半、均乏成交賣價十五元、由生源永售出五十兩而已、到頭更寂、加水難免再升、掉期昨由元茂永貼出三十五條、大昌祥七十條、由春源永貼進七角、</p>

<h3>外滙昨多掉期交易</h3>
<p>—華商略拋美金—</p>
<p>滙市昨華商雖塞、銀行維持、結果尚平、晨初以海外電告、倫敦大條近遠俱升一八七五、紐約銀市勿動、蒙得里遠期銀價升三厘半及四厘不等、倫敦生金勿動、英對美跌一厘半、英對法降二生丁、英對日勿動、美對英勿動美對法縮〇六二五、美對日跌一分、中央銀行掛牌揭曉英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、滙市晨開近期賣價、與前收相彷彿、開後洋行塞出近期美金沙遜塞出近期先令、而扒遠期、銀行對掉、滙豐掛牌英美俱平、平衡稅上升一分而尚定、小呂宋方面電掉滙兌、午刻轉盤、後市華商塞出美金外商銀行均扒、得以維持、中途因間有銀行對做而掙扎、收盤賣價現貨一先令、便士六二五、美滙二十九元七五、較之前收計英美俱平、遠期亦然、華商略拋美金、西商則注目於掉期及滙兌交易而已、令將一天成交錄後、</p>
<p>英滙晨開近期賣價一先令便士六二五、花旗麥加利出沙遜七月份五六二五及五三一二五對搭、而進沙遜四月份六三五、交通進小呂宋現貨六二五、後市大英扒六月份五九三七五、收盤賣價現貨一先令二便士六三五、四月份五九三七五、五月份九六五、六月份五三一二五、進價酌加〇三一二五、成交約四萬鎊、</p>

<p>英美滙兌昨由交通扒英塞美、興小呂宋對做現貨四元八角八分三七五、</p>
<h3>證券　本月期最後一日公債多頭紛紛出籠</h3>
<p>丁種跌一元一角為最鉅</p>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、為本月份期貨最後一日市况已屬不振、多方已紛紛出籠、雖尚有少數拉抬、人心已渙散、因四十三號之現貨流出、逐盤湧售、多方猛受打擊、四號多頭紛紛斬割、五號十號及四十五號均紛紛賣出市况經過、上午開盤、多頭卽有出籠、市價一律回跌、驟小三五角至一元有奇、惟做多者、復行買進、且以本月份為最後一日關係、故前列戊丁種稍小四五角、但後列仍被拉起半元至一元有零、但賣方大都俱有實貨、致市况仍不能維持午後開盤、市况頗有參差、高低一角至六角、收盤大戶紛紛出售、市况顯已下瀉、一律再回跌二角至六角半、市價結果、小五分一角至一元一角、今日祇做四月份期貨一個月、成交總數、共計二千零二十六萬五千元、茲特其漲跌結果、較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元、）</p>
<h3>紗花　紗銷減色標紗一漲卽跌</h3>
<p>多頭乘高價突來出籠　本月交貨二萬四千包</p>
<p>紗市回挫趨勢平靜、良以現紗銷塲較前為少天津帮連朝大購、胃口似有飽滿之象、暫時停止、亦意中事、同時多方在近期乘漲時突來出檔以致籌碼鬆懈、市盤乃轉向下墮、但海外棉業情形脚地仍昂、本月份紗今天為最後一日、交貨量大約在二萬二千包至四千包之間云、</p>
<p>本月軋小一元五角　標紗前市開盤、各月繼續　進、因美棉果然回漲、但二盤開出、跌風忽起、以三品紗平平、且多頭乘漲時又來出籠、故檯面鬆濫、市氣愈見挫折、盤盤而下、但現紗交易尚堪維持、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均跌六•七•八角至一元四角、午後開盤市情仍盤旋無力、因多頭在近期吐出、現紗交易不若上日之旺、人氣愈覺疲乏、四盤中絕無甚大進出、結果各月比上午收盤價漲跌一角、查賣出合興一千八百包、恒益二千五百包、錦昌一千一百包、賡豐三千五百包、豐泰八百五十包、大昌成八百五十包、長豐六千二百包、潤康二千六百五十包、恒昌九百包、生源八百包、大昶二千〇五十包、買進益昶一千一百包、望泰興二千五百包、大豐九百包、達記一千二百包、明德四千五百五十包、瑞大一千二百五十包、申大一千一百五十包、仁豐一千三百包、協成二千一百五十包、福康一千一百包、永大一千九百包、信誠二千八百包、愼記九百包、一日間較高低價列左、</p>
<p>現銷祇一千四百包　現紗銷路稍清、查全日各帮買去統計一千四百三十九包、售價與上日相仿、各帮買額列下、</p>
<h3>標花被粗絨壓倒</h3>
<p>—隨紗市而下跌—</p>
<p>棉市轉疲、因本月期僅剩今天一日交易、粗絨原料缺乏需要、但細絨棉市上成交依然不惡、故交易所籌碼物歡迎者較鮮、壓迫尚重、又有一說、昨日美棉現貨價漲力太薄、今日或有回落之象</p>
<p>昨已回跌三四角　棉花前市開盤、本月微漲五分、拍至遠期反趨下跌、且局勢甚弱、蓋以美棉雖漲、查其漲力未强、加之日印商約業已訂定、在印棉本身有向榮之望、而華棉出口、又遭一重大打擊、故上日午後某商已大量翻空、一時附和者大都心思看不好、且本月份交貨充濫、故市價反趨下降、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均跌二角半至三角、午後開盤、市况平定、塲中交易未見大旺、上下亦微、而呈擯持之局、結果各月比上午收盤價再跌五分至一角、查賣出恒益二萬一千六百擔、同孚二千六百擔、吉豐一千七百擔、裕大三千四百擔、大豐三千二百擔、達記二千六百擔、明德七千三百擔、合興二千九百擔、賡豐七千九百擔、大昶七千一百擔、生源五千一百擔、長和一萬三千七百擔、長豐和五千擔、經華三千擔、買進益康二千八百擔、聚興三千六百擔、源大二千一百擔、振大二千六百擔、豐泰六千四百擔、望泰興二千八百擔、麥昌一萬零三百擔、益昶九千四百擔、長豐四千八百擔、協成五千一百擔、源興昌三千二百擔、新昶一千一二百擔、永大一千九百擔、信誠一千九百擔、潤康二千八擔、愼記一千九百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>細絨銷路仍暢　現棉消費尚佳、細絨花銷路仍暢云、</p>
<h3>印日商約成功世界棉市一致昂騰</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况堅昂、各月漲二十一至二九磅音、晨初、國外電訊有力、外商尤以利物浦為最、及同業華爾街活動買進、市勢非常挺秀、旋以少數套賣、榖市及股市不振、多頭了結而回、前週之大批多頭了結、足以增强實際地位、而國外市塲之舉動、亦足恢復買方之信任、同時通貨膨脹之傳說及消費之活潑、將棉田增加之顧慮、一掃而盡、收盤平疲、計現貨漲十一磅音貨漲十一至二十四磅音、英棉現貨漲十六點期貨漲十九至二十一點、印棉初因補空而堅、旋以股市不振而回、卒以印日商約成功及利物浦電訊良好再昂、計平果爾漲六•七五至七•五羅比、奧姆辣漲七•二五至八羅比、白羅溪漲七•二五、至七•五羅比、原電錄左、（二十二日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十三日開盤預測、白羅溪為三百四十七羅比、跌一羅比、奧姆辣為二百三十五羅比七五、跌一•七五羅比、平果爾為一百九十八羅比二五、跌一•二五羅比、</p>
<p>又同日孟買電、上週蘭貢方面輸出棉花二四六噸、全數運至利物浦、</p>
<h3>三品紗花回跌現紗獨漲</h3>
<p>二十三日大阪電、現紗漲五至十元、十六支扇面二百五十元、漲五元、二十支金魚二百七十二元、漲七元、四十支五金四百十元、漲十元、四十二支雉子三百九十五元、漲五元、三品期紗跌一元六角至三元三角、近月為二百六十四元六角、遠月為二百六十二元七角、期棉跌一角至六角、近月為七十九元九角、遠月為八十二元〇五分、</p>
<h3>津青漢紗花疋頭略有起伏</h3>

<h3>絲茶　俄人喜吃嗬茶</h3>
<p>華茶奈何！</p>
<p>俄國向嗬囒採購茶葉甚夥、半載以來、經滬轉口者、不下七八千箱之距、前日芝尼加拿輪進口、又有茶葉二千零六十餘箱、日內候俄輪、轉運海參崴云、</p>
<h3>海外絲昂本廠觀望</h3>
<p>昨日海外絲市、日美市氣均堅、近遠各貨咸又騰漲、橫濱現貨漲十元、期貨漲四元、紐約近期較上週六價漲四分半、期貨濺二分半、日絲八三度漲二分、七五度漲一分、其他華絲及里昂絲價、均未變更、上海絲市、現因廠商心理高昂及國外絲價漲落飄忽、故成交不多、昨日僅有三井若干新絲售開、白廠本返七八分價七七〇元、與前市無甚榮辱、印莊絲亦僅少數交易、價格如前云、</p>
<h3>糧食　現麥到頭不絕近期多頭將放棄收貨</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、因國外市氣一致報漲、業外囤胃麕集、故上午開盤、氣象蓬勃、遠近一致好四五分、迨後天氣轉晴、粉市逐步鬆落、且現貨到源、頗見連絡、近期收貨心理、漸趨懈淡、故三四月回小四五分、惟新麥氣象、尚在迷離之境、　胃趦趄、不若近期堅毅、因此午後漲落互見、勢轉平靜、較諸前日、本月份好起一分、四月份不動、六七八月漲七分至二分不等、現麥到頭絡繹、市面平平、僅申大採取二千包左右、張八嶺麥開六元二角三分、管店天台麥開六元二角分至六元一角九分、其餘各廠、均乏進胃云、</p>
<h3>交貨力量充足期粉陳跌新漲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤時、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好三角七分至五角七分、坎拿大漲四五角、利物浦大三便士六二五、且天時陰雨、一般人心、推及於麥田之發育、故遠期買胃、頗形興奮、七八月驟好二三分不等、惟本月份結束已近、交貨力量充足、業外多頭、惟有放棄、是以開盤反小分許、但遠近心理相反、漲落之間、相互牽制、因此起仆尚未激烈、迫午後天氣轉晴、而本月出胃、繼續不息尤以四月份盤面、與本月相距過遠、引起業內套胃、致上午四月份跌風轉旺、遠期亦隨疲弱、全日結果、本月份跌二分七厘半、四月份小一分二厘半、七八月份好一分左右、與前日相較、成近疲遠秀之局云、</p>
<h3>本客米市况俱平淡</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮米源較前略少、共到近五十號、貨共萬一千一二百石、內中薄稻廿餘號、疲頺市况、昨因天雨人心轉堅、惟銷塲本街雖較稍動、然仍屬不暢、且對於薄稻胃口殊淡、至於包胃較前反懈、南北洋兩帮共祇辦近二千包、故簿稻行情雖無榮辱、而形勢殊屬平庸、庫粳因價已跌透、略回幾分、早稻則僅平平、杜洋尖及陰兀亦皆無軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日晨刻天時忽陰忽雨、河下各路來源十五六號、市上賣買雙方上市寥落、致各貨交易平淡、價形較前市無甚上落、惟陰變兀貨稀銷活、價形挺立、其餘各貨價形均無上落、</p>
<p>（客秈）到多銷細、市面更見軟弱、粵帮辦胃似無繼續希望汕厦西北各帮久乏暢胃、統市成交不足三千包、北洋帮辦去機元米少許外、均屬本街應酬、本街以河下存到兩足、亦乏進意、因　市形幾有一蹶不振象、全日統共售開江西機糙米二千四百多包、價比前市又小角外云、</p>

<h3>模範國貨家庭展覽會</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>上海市國貨運動聯合會，最近擬舉辦模範國貨家庭展覽會，這件事於國貨的推行上有很大的效力，吾們認為值得舉辦的，不過對於進行上有幾層貢獻</p>
<p>第一模範國貨四個字，顧名思義，便是會有第一流國貨的意思，所以貨品之選擇，必須嚴格，必須頂眞，要寧缺無濫。尤其要對於國貨品級標準加以十分的注意，如果在第五等品級以下，呌他模範國貨總覺得不甚合宜。</p>
<p>第二模範國貨，應就飲食品，服裝品，日用品，文具品，化裝品，旅行品乃至建築材料等，都該分門別類，現定徵集的範圍，總以價廉物美純粹國產為標準</p>
<p>第三模範國貨家庭，不一定要堂皇富麗，更不必去競事奢華，儘可隨各家主收入的多少，生活力的豐嗇，定出幾種方式出來，譬如收入二百元薪水的家庭如何布置，一百元薪水的如何布置，四十元薪水的如何布置，給各層階級的人作一個實際參考，使他們採用國貨時候，有所依據這是很重要的，</p>
<p>吾們希望各工廠和社會各方面，竭力贊助這個展覽會，早早開幕，於國貨界有很大效用的。</p>
<h3>改進國貨推銷的建議</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>在最近來的我們國貨界，因為一方面靠着大多數民衆愛護國產信心的普遍堅立，一方面依賴農村豐收，內地一般人民購買力的增進，於圍產銷路的比較上，顯然已有相當的進展，許多國貨廠商營業額的逐漸增高，這確是一個很好的現象。</p>
<p>不過在當前，我們很深切地覺到，國貨界實在更應抓住這個機會，再努力注意在國貨推銷技術上的改進，我們知道，過去外貨的所以能夠在我國各地到處傾銷，深入窮鄉僻壤，它主要的憑籍，就是因為牠有高度的推銷方法，能適應着我國的各地實情而進行，因此，它能夠擁有這樣偌大的市塲，獲得龐大的銷路，而在目前，我們也應如何努力推銷方法的精益求精，實在也是很必要，而且是很迫切的事，在下面，我有幾個對於改進國貨今後推銷實際的建議，寫出來敢貢獻給從事國貨事業的人們：</p>
<p>第一•注意國貨的包裝　這是改進國貨推銷亟應注意之一，這一方面要使貨品的裝飾，使購買者對牠發生一種好感，且須迎合各地人土審美觀念，作不同之裝飾，另一方面更應注意包裝嚴密，使貨品的質地永遠保存，糾正過去國貨運輸常有缺少損壞之弊。</p>
<p>第二•注重廣告與宣傳　廣告與宣傳的能推動銷路，這果早已給國貨界注意，但今後應更使其發揮實際効力，務須因各工業，各地市塲，行銷對象之不同，而加以具體之研究，尤其應注意在推廣邊區銷路和開拓國外市塲上，下深刻的功夫。</p>
<p>第三•注意店員的禮貌　怎樣才能迎合顧客的心理，過去外界常對國貸廠商的店員，有缺乏禮貌的批評，所以今後對於平時訓練店員，也為改進國貨推銷中主要課題之一。</p>
<p>其他如國貨運輸的應求迅速便宜，國貨品質的精益求精，商塲或門市部佈置的注意，當然也都是改進國貨推銷中，所必要做到的，在這個國貨前途，漸見進步的時候，我們希望國貨界能加以更大的努力，獲得國產更大的發展。</p>
<h3>農業衰落中之海鹽綢布</h3>
<p>— 諸琴</p>
<p>我國素號以農立國，人民均各務農為業，除種植大宗米，麥，棉，蔴之外，而江浙一帶，尤為蠶桑彙集之區。農民於耕耘之睱，以育蠶為副業，藉資補救農民之經濟。</p>
<p>年來外貨傾銷猖獗，外絲產量激增，於貿於料，均較我國為上。更以人造絲一種，已致我國蠶絲於致命傷。而反觀我國之蠶絲業，已趨入沒落之途，言之扼痛。我國對於育蠶栽桑種種方法，循照數千年來之舊法，若與歐美各國及東亞日本諸國育蠶事業比較，無怪相形見絀，事實昭然。人以科學方法，我則循守舊規，數千年如一日，不知改良。方今科學倡明，猶不急起直追，雖聞政府有復興農村之計劃，一般人有高喊救濟農村之呼號，但計劃必竟是計劃，呼聲猶在耳膜，農民切身痛苦，仍侵入水深火熱之中。觀於此，我國蠶絲業之前途，終于危殆而為外絲所摧滅也。</p>
<p>日前知友任文煇君由海鹽來滬，述及海鹽最近農業棉綢與蔴布衰落之狀况，殊覺殷切，余聞後有感，姑略記之，以實本刊。</p>
<p>海鹽農婦，於蠶事告竣後，有將雙宮薄皮等繭，以手工製成極細綿綫；有劈蔴為縷，以木機織成綢布，銷於就近一帶，獲利尚佳。惜該項手工業，在海鹽無整個織綢廠之組織，又乏善良之指導，墨守成規，所以不能遠達外省，銷行海外。近來正在積極提倡國貨。若能投資該地農村，設立織綢廠，改良指導，則所出綢布，堅韌耐用，價廉物美，遠勝舶來品之上。</p>
<p>距縣城二十餘里之永安湖，居民每於夏季，均以手工劈蔴為縷，以木機製成蔴布，（俗稱澉浦夏布）。銷於附近各縣，其色有黃白二種，黃者稱遜，白者頗佳，可製為夏衣之用。前年該地機關，團體，士紳等，發起以黃色蔴布製為各種夏季制服，御之於身，雖在炎日當空之下，汗流浹背之時，亦不為汗滴所膩，且極凉爽舒適。　　　除土織蔴布之外，在海鹽四鄉，年老農民，不能工作田園，則從事織製絲棉。將一切雙宮薄皮之繭，用沸水煮後，浸入水中，歷十餘日後，用木杵搗之於湖畔，待其勻和，曝乾後，完全以手指拈成細絲，再以木機織成，名曰綿綢。該項綿綢，亦有粗細糙白之分，細白者可為夏衫短衣等，粗渾者，或染色於秋冬作襯衣之類，柔軟體貼，惜以手工木機之織造，故出品不能與機械之絲織品相抗，然經久耐用之功，萬倍於時下絲綢，且價格低廉，最高者每尺祗一角餘，最下者每尺僅數分耳。（未完）</p>
<h3>工廠檢查與國貨工業</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>上海市工廠檢查所，已於本年二月二十一日正式成立，開始辦公了。這不但是上海市各工廠的福音，尤其是一般的國貨工廠所共同感到欣慰的一件事。因為實施工廠檢查，和國貨工業的前途，在在有着很密切的關係。</p>
<p>年來我國國貨事業，上蒙政府當局的維護提倡，下得各界同胞的樂於服用，較之若干年前，固已有了很顯著的成績。然而，我們假如檢閱一船國貨工廠的內容，或因安全與衛生設備之末臻妥善，或因管理技術之缺乏訓練，以致工廠災害尚未能達到完全避免的地步。如前年正泰橡膠工廠，太乙麥精粉廠汽鍋之爆炸，上海大中華賓璐珞廠火災之發生，都是遭遇到很大的損失，與極多的阻礙。此種工廠災害的迭次演出，不特在國貨工廠的本身方面，受到莫大的影響，卽整個的國貨工業，也在無形之中，遭着相當的阻礙。所以，如何防止工業災害，使國貨工廠，不致受到意外的打擊？這不但是國貨工廠的主持者，所應力謀解决的一個問題，站在國貨界的立塲而論，也是我們應該共同研究，共同討論的一個問題。</p>
<p>筆者以為避免災害之發生，其要素固多，而切實施行工廠檢查，確是减少工廠災害的一種有效方法。因為工廠檢查所的工作，不僅注意於工廠的各項記錄，童工女工及學徒的工作狀况，以及災變死亡傷害之調查等數項，而尤其注意於工廠之安全，與衛生的設備，是否達於眞正妥善的境界，以冀工廠災害的根本消泯，和工人體格的日趨健康，這種工作，就面表的觀察，似乎無甚重要，而究其實際，却和整個的國貨工業，無論直接的，間接的，都有密切的關係，因為實施工廠檢查，直接可以减少工廠災害之發生，間接更可使出品迅速，生產率增加，當此國貨事業正待扶植發展，與夫國人對於國貨，逐漸的普遍樂用之際，吾人甚望上海市工廠檢查所，能積極推進檢查工作，切實的指導工廠安全，與衛生的設備，則嘉惠國貨生產界，殊非淺鮮。筆者欣慰之餘，願拭目以觀其效。</p>
<h3>從土布運動說到邰氏夫婦</h3>
<p>— 德鄰</p>
<p>中國婦女們的崇尚奢華，伊們平素在一舉一動之間，時刻以效倣歐化競趨摩登，爭相表現着自己的豪闊富有：所以“衣必錦繡，”“居必麗都，”種下了伊們根深蒂固的虛榮心。便是曾受過高等敎育的女子，往往也不能夠逃避這個的惡劣觀念，不信，現在且舉個事實來瞧瞧。</p>
<p>在過去大夏大學敎育院院長邰爽秋博士，和黃季馬女士離婚的新聞上：便可以找到一個深刻的刺謬，事實是這樣的。</p>
<p>邵爽秋博士是位敎育界的聞人，平素愛護國產，提倡土布，不遺餘力，到處宣傳，逢人勸導，並且躬行不懈，自己終年服着原料來自鄉間自紡自織的土布，他摯熱的心，是值得稱道的。但是，他家裹的夫人，黃季馬女土，是極端反對的，所以邰博士雖然終年服用土布，說不定家裹的夫人，仍然是在“衣必錦繡。”</p>
<p>因為邰博士愛護國產的摯熱，所以到處宣傳，逢人勸導，有一次，忽然有人向邰博土提出詰問：邰先生雖然終年服用土布，可是對自己家裹也勸導一例服用土布了嗎？這樣一來，邰博士受到了一個深切而帶着取笑的刺激，回到家裹，便也勸他的夫人也服用土布，不料得到的結果，非但不能依從，並且由此就意見不合，便反目而决裂了。雖然，他們的離婚，是官冕堂皇，托詞於志趣不合，在律師處履行了離婚的手續，並且向法院裹備了案。據說：後來雖然離婚了，大約是邰夫人遵了邰博士的勸導，而服用土布了，忽又有重圓的消息傳出，終因意見未能接近，卒致離異。</p>
<p>邵博士提倡土布運動，那種誠摯的心，雖然失去了愛人，而仍躬行不懈，不稍改變，現在邰博士經各方的議婚，和自己的選擇，已得到了一位志同道合的新夫人。胡佩貞女士，聽說本月二十八日在學藝社結婚了。不過，邰博士和黃季馬女士的結合，是由同學而進一步結婚的，並且都是從事敎育的，一切的見解，當然是高人一等：然而出人意外的那位邰夫人，竟為了不願服用土布，便推翻了夫婦的情感，不顧一切地而情願離婚了。由此更可窺見一般婦女的虛榮心，比任何一切都來得重大。在此，我更有一種感想：就是邰博土勸人服用土布是多麼的摯誠，想不到自己家裹的那位也從事敎育的夫人，都勸導不醒，何况其他未曾受過敎育的人呢？不禁使我對着那純粹的國貨前途，發生了一種深刻的悲觀。</p>

<h3>今日與明日</h3>
<p>— 吳壽康</p>
<p>今日事，今日畢；要是等到明日做，至少明日的事被侵蝕而蒙損失了！</p>
<p>“今朝望明朝，明朝望後朝，一生一世弄不好！”——這是俚語。</p>
<p>唯有今日，唯有現在，是有希望的，是應努力抓住而不該使它輕輕溜過去的。</p>
<p>天天在挨明天的人，他的理想總成泡影的。因為到了明天，他又在等明天而永遠不會現實了呀！</p>
<p>明日明日，人人都將有沒有明日的一日！</p>
<p>天下眞不知有多少為了等待明日而誤了他們一切前途事業的人？</p>
<p>今日是實際的，是能兌現的；明日是抽象的，是不可捉摸的。</p>
<p>朋友！機會站在目前，就在今日！切莫錯過了它呀！</p>
<p>“等明天吧！等明天吧！”天下有成千累萬的人因它而失意的失意，失敗的失敗了。</p>
<h3>不夜之街</h3>
<p>— 焦士潔</p>
<p>上海是不夜之城，不夜之城裹的不夜之街，要算是浙江路這條馬路了。</p>
<p>在大馬路與北京路之間，這一段浙江路，實在可以稱為商業薈萃之區，而尤其夜市，是勝過了南京路的繁華的，不，是勝過了全上海任何一條馬路的！</p>
<p>上海雖然是繁華的所在，但晚上至十二點鐘過後，無論那一條馬路，都漸漸地冷落了。商家大半打了烊，路上稀落的行人再也凑不起熱鬧來，電車停止了，汽車也是一輛二輛的過去，於是卽使是日間最繁盛的大馬路，也似乎疲乏似的死了過去，空餘着路燈的光明。雖然在那戲館子跳舞廳裹散塲的時候，有一大批的人遊乏了的退出來，但剎那之間，這熱鬧的塲面又寂然了，而且卽使熱鬧，只小小的一塊兒熱鬧，怎及得上浙江路一帶的熱鬧呢！</p>
<p>浙江路，這不夜之街上，商舖多的是鞋帽店，飲食店，還有小的百貨商店，在那些店家的櫥窗裹，年虹燈的燈光普照着，人聲在那裹熱盈盈的熙來攘往；一至西風吹起，這路上還有洋澄湖大蟹的旗幟，突然增多起來，平時也有不斷的水果攤販，排列成了一字，發出腔調雖同聲音各異的呌賣聲來</p>
<p>華燈初上，遊人如鯽的時候，站馬路的雉妓如下總動員令的全體出動了。穿着耀眼的衣飾，抹上白白的粉，塗上紅紅的胭脂，來回的逡巡，逡巡着，如花草散着芳香，去勾引得蜂蝶兒顚狂。</p>
<p>浙江路上的繁華延長下去，一直延長到三四點鐘，甚至黎明，呵，這是不夜之街啊！</p>
<p>不夜之城有了不夜之街，才名實相符，不夜之街托庇在不夜之城裹，助長了它的繁榮。</p>
<h3>金鍼秘傳序</h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>金鍼之法，由來已久，或謂創始於黃帝，然吾觀史記扁鵲倉公列傳，知周秦之間，固已盛行此法。雖黃帝創始之言，是否假託，要為中國醫學中最古而最不背於科學之醫術，則無可疑也。其傳也，多師弟手口相授，重實習而不重空言，學者每苦於穴道認識之難，望而去之，故其傳遂狹，以至於今，蓋式微矣。夫以數寸之鍼，而能已一切之病，此在治科學者，或疑其妄。然而經絡穴道未嘗不與交感神經有關，鍼治功效，實與內分泌作用無異。是其術雖神奇，而其理則眞確，不得以解剖學上之所不能解釋者一槪懷疑之也。職是之故，歐洲之醫學先進國家乃多注意及此。巴黎市立醫院近設中國鍼科一門，若干病症，多以金鍼治之：而醫學院亦用科學方法為具體之研究焉。顧在我國則不然，此道中人，多自秘其術。其一知半解者固無論矣，卽有深通其故者，亦多諱莫如深，有詢之者，或告以一二，而隱其七八，或示以皮毛，而秘其精義，或力言其難，使問者知難而止，或謬為妄說，使學者以妄為眞，雖其弟子亦不肯盡心授之，而况於他人乎？知不肯言，言不肯盡，以自留瞰飯之餘地，而忽視學術之保存，此鍼術之在中國所以日衰也。方君愼盦，今之金鍼專家也，懸壺海上，名噪一時，嘗恨同道者之自秘其術，而懼鍼法之因此失傳，有求敎者，必傾其奧妙以告之；並著金鍼秘傳一書，以謀鍼法之普及於天下，其意善矣。夫學術者，天下之公器，而醫學者又濟世之仁術也。秘則以公器為私產，而以仁術為利途矣，君有見及此，故以其師之眞傳筆而出之，以公諸世，謂非仁者之用心乎？君之盡，於鍼法之闡述，固已詳盡無遺，而對於暈鍼之解法，尤多至十餘穴道，此更非普通金鍼書籍所可及。有志於此者，取而讀之，可以無師自通其秘，不愈於千里求師而終身不得其要領者乎？此余之所以樂為之序也。</p>
<h3>楊貴妃的偷</h3>
<p>— 花病鶴</p>
<p>偶然和幾個朋友，談談關於偷的故事，從東方朔偷桃談起，而姮娥偷藥，而韓壽偷香，最後更談到楊貴妃。</p>
<p>妻不如妾，妾不如偷，然而女子亦何嘗不然；記得在大眞外傳裹面，有這樣一段記載着說：“有姊三人，皆豐碩修整，工於謔浪，巧於旨趣，每入宮中，移𣌿方出，……所以張佑有時說：“䝞國潛行韓國隨，宜春小院映花枝，金輿遠幸無人見，偷把郃王小管吹。”這個偷字，就很設味，而張佑還自詩說：“梨花深院無人見，閑把寗王玉笛吹。”從這兩首詩上面看來，也不難想像貴妃浪到什麼程度了。</p>
<p>關於貴妃和安祿山的話，袁隨園有兩句詩說：“唐書新舊分明在，那有金錢洗祿見。”不錯，舊唐書是沒有記載過這件事，無怪隨園自負能替貴妃洗寃，算為平生的得意手筆了；其實就算有這件事，在偷的意義上着想，就未免有些幹得太蠢，何况貴妃是聰明不過的女人，明皇也究竟不是傻子啊。</p>
<p>然而我總有些懷疑着，當伊在沉香亭賞芍藥的時候，分明很喜歡李太白的清平調，為了裹面有把趙飛燕來譬喻的話，給人家胡縐了幾句，便又無端地恨起太白來，假使伊沒有偷的話，未免太多疑了。</p>
<h3>對牛崇拜的西夏人</h3>
<p>— 立平</p>
<p>西夏在中國境內，算是一塊荒僻的土地，那裹的居民，大都還是維持着古代社會的一種狀態，所以一切生活形態也都有點兒神化，特別是對於牛的𥚢拜，更是西夏人民的迷信中，為唯一的神聖東西。</p>
<p>牛神，在西夏人民的眼裹，幾乎要比一切的神都要神聖一點，所以一切的生活，大都以牛神的權威來支配的。例如結婚，在當地的男女，如要結婚時必須到敬牛神的廟裹去求决定，如牛神的决定是好的，那無論如何不合適的婚姻非成就不可，假使牛神的决定是不佳，誰也只好如命的做去，不敢有所反抗，同時結婚日期也都是由神來决定的，結婚之日，新婚的男女及父母族長等，也須到牛神廟去舉行婚禮。除了結婚之外更有趣的是產孩子，假如遇到生兒子，胎婦在臨盆的一個月內，必須每天到神廟去禱告，生下兒子的那天，就從外面拉來了一隻牛，把新生的孩子偎在牛的身邊，經過了一個晚上，才能把孩子抱進屋子去。滿月之後，更須把孩子縛在牛背上一整天，請客的那一天，就把這隻牛殺來作請客的菜。以上的這兩種習俗，都是一種𥚢拜牛的迷信在西夏。</p>

<p>特寫</p>
<h3>洞庭西山利民煤鑛巡視記</h3>
<p>— 羅正</p>
<p>幾天來，我給那連綿的寒雨困在屋子裹，連鎮上都不能去一次，那無涯的寂寞向我包圍着，使我對於這荒村生活，感覺憎惡起來。幸喜今天雨住了，於是一周來要去參觀利民煤鑛的心願，也總算可以實現了。</p>
<p>過了天王門，便可看到一列漆黑的搶笆，在黑搶笆中間，我們發現了一座城樓似的大門，傍邊，靜靜地掛着一塊銅牌，那“利民煤鑛公司”的幾個正楷字，却正對我們笑迎着。</p>
<p>走進門，便可看见鑛塲裹面的忙碌情形：嘈杂的聲音却頓時充滿了耳根子。我們先到左首辦公室裹，但那兒却靜悄悄地沒有一個人。在倉庫前，遇到了鑛務主任趙君，他正在指揮鑛窿下面的建築工程，看他手裹拿了一枝營造尺，奔來奔去的，十分忙碌的樣子，但是望見了我們，就把工作捺了，笑嘻嘻地迎上來招待我們了。</p>
<p>我們好像很熟習地，自動向裹面闖去，趙君也跟着我們走。在一個鑛窿前，正有許多黑子在工作着，摩達的聲音是軋軋軋的，在隨着鑛板的擊撞而緩急。黑黑的煤塊，一籮一籮地從三十二丈深的鑛窿裹，由那摩達盤車吊到了鑛塲上面，然後，便讓那輛四輪鐵車馱着，從那婉蜓的輕便鐵軌上爬過去，送進了倉庫。</p>
<p>尖銳的汽笛在灰黯的空氣中長鳴了三下，那些輪到班頭的黑子們，全穿上烏黑油光的油布衣，帽，聚集到工務間裹去，點上了那雙小小的電石燈，由工頭指派着，隨着這一班的監工，到鑛窿口來等待着換班。盤車迅速地由地層下面吊起來，帶上了一羣一羣的煤黑子，他們臉上全塗滿了黑迹，衣上是濕漉漉地，每個人手中都提着一隻電石燈，那細小的火光在風中搖幌着。然而同時，鑛塲上的一羣一羣的黑子，又給那輛盤車送到了那口黑洞洞而深不可見的煤井裹</p>
<p>看過了鑛窿，我們很想自己下去；體騐一下地層下的生活，但據趙君說，要下窿，必須要穿油布衣帽才行，今天鑛師王錫藩，總辦王子文先生等都要下去，過一天，公司裹的油布衣有空時，可讓我穿了下去一次的。隨後，我們便由趙君領導着，在鑛區裹巡視了一回，並且去參觀了鑛工，木工，竹工，摩達，水汀，的各部份工塲。在工務處的屋後，堆積着無數松木，據說那是鑛窿下面的工程木料，他們平常總要有數千元的木料堆存。現在還在整理鑛窿期間，出煤的數量還祇夠供自用，日後第二口鑛窿整理好了，正式開始採煤時，需要之木料還要廣泛呢。我們正在談話的當兒，總務主任虞先生却伴着王子文先生等來了，他招呼王先生等下了鑛窿後，就來招待我們，我們於是在一個精緻簡單的會客室裹，和他談了很多鑛中情形及煤鑛概况，直到天下了雨，𦆵告辭出來</p>
<h3>鳳鸞換巢</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　白版紅笺空還两行漠荻花楓葉獨步半城秋</p>
<p>小松似乎把這句話看得很認眞，將茶杯放下，兩手按了膝蓋，向他望着道：你不要以為找橋雜記上的人物，都是些下流的，這裹也很有些可取的女子。你是不肯到這種地方去，假使你督同我到這些地方去看過兩次，你一定不能一概抹煞。國器拱了兩拱手，他雖然沒有說什麼，在他帶着微笑的臉上，他分明是謝絕了。小松看了這情形，也沒有把話再向下說。因道：你這幾首詩，我抄了下去，替你和上幾首好不好？國器道：小說我還沒有做成，你就要和詩，透着大家有點互相標榜。等我在雜誌上發表以後，你再和罷。小松笑道：據我看來，你這幾首詩，永遠不會發表的。說着，自起身把那張詩稿折疊了幾折，放到抽屜裹去，將掛在衣架上的帽子取到手裹，向他作了半個揖，笑道：我想你要作的詩，還不止這幾首，我在這裹，打斷你的詩興了。說着，忽忽的向外面走去。國器倒覺得他這一去，多少為了一點避嫌的原因，自己更是不安，就隨着後面，送出大門。而且帶說着話，向巷子口上送去。就在這個時候，前面來了一位女郎，穿上一件鴛鴦格子的綠色夾襖，長長的青湖縐裙子。黑漆皮鞋，走得地面上略略有聲。他的前額，垂下來很長的留海髮，雪白的臉上，淺淺的兩塊大紅暈，很是美麗。小松遠遠的看到他，就覺得眼光被他吸收住了。及至他慢慢的走到面前，他那一雙大大的眼睛，把眼皮垂了下去，簇擁着兩道睫毛在外。（一四九）</p>

<h3>再談踢毽子和放風箏</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前天我見中宣部提倡踢毽子和放風箏的命令，惹動了我童年時玩意兒的興趣，便寫了一文，不料此文寫成後，未曾送給本刋，而羅君的同一題目，已經登載出來了，好在題目雖同，而感想不一，並且拙作中還有一些補充的意見，故仍將該稿送去，恐不免有畫蛇添足之誚，祈閱者諒之。</p>
<p>若談起踢毽子與放風箏，我却算得一個老內家，因為我是老了，又是內家，老內家三字，我却受之無愧，講踢毽子麼？提，陪，拐，撞，左，練，罕，跥，八者皆能，所謂跺者，以足背踢高毽也，跺字我寫不出，就拿這跥字來替代一下吧？此外還有打跳，所謂打跳者，將身躍起，以右足向後踢高也，這是踢毽藝術之更進一步矣，講放風箏麼？大九彩，小九彩，人颻，鷹颻，蝴蝶颻，馬桶颻，百腳颻，多是放過，而亦很有研究，很有經騐，因為我小的時候，不肯念書，獨對於以上兩種玩意呢，到有特別興趣，特別嗜好，所以我對於這兩種東西，亦特別來得道地。</p>
<p>不過最受累的，到是一位老親娘，因為踢毽子放風箏的緣故，常常弄得青蛙相打滿身泥，鞋子一月一雙還嫌不夠，常常鞋頭破襪底穿，因此時常要吃排頭，罵為不長進的東西，討飯的坯子，但是罵儘管讓她罵，打儘管讓她打，颻子不能不放，毽子不可不踢，現在想想，這種排頭吃得眞是冤枉孽障，恨我早生了數十年，假定晚生了數十年，非但這些，排頭可以免吃，而且還像奉旨奉憲似的，拿了風箏，懷了毽子，徉徜而去，父母對之，也只有笑笑，或者還可讚美一聲我的好兒子呢。</p>
<p>我現在還想到小的時候，不但有以上兩種嗜好，我還有一種特別藝術，便是滾銅錢，這種玩意兒，我覺得比較放風箏和踢毽子，還更有趣味兒，因為滾銅錢全靠眼力和手法，欲錢之遠近偏側在於手，欲錢之擊射命中在於目，所以這種玩意兒，與兒童之目力手法，很有密切的關係，有很大的研究，我在十餘歲時，在一二丈外的錢，我以錢擊錢可以命中，可以測着，我在兒童中，却是一個滾銅錢的能手，因此有幾位兒童，看見我在裹頭，往往袖手傍觀，不肯與我合作，因合作必輸於我也，這幾種封建時代兒童的玩意兒，我到有當仁不讓之。</p>
<p>中央提倡踢毽子與放風箏，我想滾銅錢的玩意兒，也不妨提倡一下，因為中央所以提倡踢毽子與放風箏的緣故，無非欲使兒童體力的增加，筋骨的活動，與兒童的健康，大有關係，但是滾銅錢的玩意兒，對於兒童目力方面，手法方面，亦十分有益，並且風箏祇放於春季，踢毽多在冬時，大祇有時令性的，獨滾銅錢，則無春無夏，無秋無冬，時時可以舉行，練習較易純熟，假定年齡稍長，或軍事訓練，打起靶來，或戰爭發生，當起兵來，其射擊能力，必定超越尋常一等，此滾銅錢之所以亦有提倡之必要也。</p>
<h3>“賢母”的“母敎”</h3>
<p>— 忻炘</p>
<p>離兒童節還有十多天，某婦女敎育館在兒童節舉行的“母敎比賽”的辦法却已經决定，並且在報上公佈了，這足見對兒童的關心，委實值得欽佩。</p>
<p>考所以舉行“母敎比賽”的原因，“比賽宗旨”上說得明白，云：“本館為促進各家庭為母親者之責任心，并造成社會重視賢母風氣起見，特定於每年兒童節舉行母敎比賽一次。”至其比賽項目，則分㊀體格，㊁清潔，㊂禮貌，㊃應對。記分的方法，則是體格以三十分為滿分，清潔以二十分為滿分，禮貌與應對，各以二十五分為滿分云。</p>
<p>現在先說“賢母”。郭沫若先生在一篇“旋轉乾坤論”中有云：“像古時候的‘無違夫子以順為正’或‘夫死從子’‘母以子貴’的那種妾婦之道，那似乎連妻和母的資格都還說不上，當然是更說不上所謂‘賢’，所謂‘良’吧？然而那樣的以脂粉奴隸而兼家庭奴隸的妻母，却正是古人乃至一部份人的令人所懸想的‘賢妻良母’。這樣的妻，這樣的母之所以‘賢’所以‘良’，大約是因為她們如‘清風明月不用一錢買，比起娼妓和奶媽來要經濟得多的原故吧？”繼之他就用生物學的見地，多方面的來主張“旋轉乾坤”。而在讀了“為促進各家庭為母親者之責任心，并造成社會重視賢母起見”的“母敎比賽”的“宗旨”以後，更不禁想到他所說的“他們苦心孤詣地想把女人的運命束縛於終身而兼世襲的義務娼妓兼奶媽之位置，而美其名曰賢妻良母”。而這‘賢良’的醐醒味，直到現在似乎又把往日的娜拉灌醉，喚回‘木偶家庭’去了。”（見同文）</p>
<p>所謂“賢母”旣是如此，而在這樣“賢母”的“母敎”下的孩子又是怎樣呢？約略可以分為二種，一種，我們從比賽項目的，三項中可以揣想出來，與賽的孩子一定是肥肥白白怪有“敎養”的，身上的衣服很清潔，知道吃東西之前要洗手，“應對”起來或許還會說Yes或No等字眼，看見不清潔的小同伴，他們也許會很快的避開，或者，甚至是舉起穿了小皮鞋的小腳蹴了幾下，或者呌傭婦把“小呌化”們趕開去。</p>
<p>這種有“敎養”的孩子，打起分數來，自然是該給他打個“滿分”的。另外一種“賢母”的“母敎”下的孩子，則體格上也許有幾分之幾是得天獨厚，勉強夠及格，但大多數則與先天不足後天失調，大半是“骨瘦如柴”，至於清潔，禮貌，應對，自然更談不上，他們因為被前一種孩子們蹴慣，見了之後，便祇好怯生生地躱開，以免屁股上再多幾塊青塊出來，卽使有不甘屈服，敢動手還擊的，但那在“禮貌”上，顯然是太差了，還是不及格。</p>
<p>後一種孩子，自然，是連參與比賽的資格都不會有的，例如“凡參加者，由各母親率領合格年齡之兒童，來館報名登記，隨繳母子或母女四寸半身照片二張，領取與賽證一紙，照規定日期時問，來館比賽。”他們便不會有這樣的餘閒和照片，其實卽使他們有了，也一定先把這些金錢和餘閒，去替孩子們縫一件新衣，然後領她們的孩子上城隍廟什麼的去向木偶叩頭，求菩薩保應她們的孩子長大。</p>
<p>現在離兒童節還有十多天，到了那天，除了這個“促進為母親者之責任心”及“造成社會重視賢母風氣”的“母敎比賽”之外，是一定還有其他的新鮮花樣的，然而我們的兒童將會得到些什麼呢？這却很難說了。</p>
<p>而照現在我的想頭，則想把兒童節取消。</p>
<h3>偉大的藥房</h3>
<p>— 天空</p>
<p>完備的診室</p>
<p>你假使乘坐十七路無軌電車，到了四馬路河南路，你就可以聽見賣票員喊着：“五洲藥房到了”，從這一點上，你也就可以知道五洲藥房的著名了。</p>
<p>五洲藥房的出名，不單是因為它的范圍廣大，出品優良，並且因為它能隨時用各種方法，替社會熱心服務，像總店的十層大厦，內部特闢各科的醫療診室，（在四樓，電梯直達，）診室裝置非常完備，各科都由海上名醫分別主診，負責療治，沒有簡陋疏忽的弊端，並且鑒於病家配藥，往往等候需時，不免發生焦急，所以特在診室之部，附設收方處，診病以後，藥方隨卽配好，就可帶回服用，非常省事。</p>
<p>偉大的藥房有完備的診室，使病家診病配藥，兩得其便，這怎能不說是社會的福音呢。</p>
<h3>不幸的人</h3>
<p>— 關尹喜</p>
<p>三年前，一個陰沉的下午，那泥水作工頭，把她和一宗不算小的產業丟開，在一雙花木床上長眠了。</p>
<p>從此，她就着手來管理那些產業，沒有帮助和關心的。從幼小的時候起，她就是一個有點傻氣，癡笨，不懂世故的女孩子，結婚後，除了那閒雅的體格變得更加強壯外，沒有什麼改變。開始她讓幾畝菜園荒蕪了，再後就連菓園也失却照顧，因此鄰人們都存了揶揄的心。始而常在夜間溜進菜園偷着黃瓜，白菜，或者把牛羊假裝無意中放進去；繼後就指使那些頑皮少年，當菓實成熟时，爬進圍墻，滿滿的摘了大半袋爬走了。</p>
<p>第一個季節過去了，產業的管理者失去了她底全部收獲之六十五，這才發現鄰人是怎樣在她不注意時進行偷竊啊！她變得瘋狂似的，揚看手中的短木棍坐在門前的石階上，整天詛罵着。受詛罵的鄰人不敢出來聲辯却指了頑皮的少年，帶住狗，出來向她甩石頭。當一塊石頭向她甩了過去的時候，狗就跟着追過去，為的想去咬住那石頭，她却覺得是來咬她的，因此就吆喝着，威脅地揚起手中的短木棍打過來。這使狗激怒了，而她也因此受了傷。</p>
<p>有一個長時間她躺臥着，污血從她底腿際流下，她不能跑，只能爬着，鄰人們感到非常得意。他們再也不必在夜深更靜時偷偷到她底菜園去，也不必指使人才敢進她底菓園裹去，他們光明正大的偷着黃瓜和菓子。後來，黃瓜沒有了，菓子過了季節，他們就荷着鋤和斧去挖菓園荒蕪的樹幹，然後再一節一節的砍成幾百小段，作燃燒的木柴用。有時為着這搶刦分得不均，鄰人們就糾打着，用鋤頭和短木棍，有時還用起小刀互相戮殺。直到那一陣闇啞的咳聲從小屋裹傳出來，他們才胆怯地丟開手中的武器躱進野草叢間去。</p>
<p>病在一個長期間過去了，她失去了健康，為着爬走習慣了，她反站立不起來，有時忘記了，勉強站立起來，結果只能眼淚汪着，搖搖頭又復坐下，她已殘廢了。</p>
<p>她底面孔是瘦削而且蒼白的，但是並沒失了她底美麗。泥水作工頭的死亡，產業的被侵害，病，殘廢都沒有使她變聰明，她照樣在迷離的世界裹生活着，她不了解一切，不相信一切。……</p>
<p>病後，為着長時問的屋裹生活過於沉悶了，她就扶着木凳子出來，坐在石階上曬太陽，或褪下半身衣服，找蚤子。她那豐潤的，沒受過生產摧殘的少婦肉體，像她底菓園，黃瓜一樣發生了吸引力。在這時她底菓園已經光滑了連根成樣的草也沒有了，菜園外的籬笆已有人在折燬了，而田裹除了青草外，便沒有別的了。</p>
<p>這不久，在深夜，鄰人中，大胆而貧困的青年，就在她底荒蕪的門外徘徊着走，當他看見四周是寂靜的，他就輕輕的推門進去。在裹面他是怎樣使他屆服，怎樣使她赤裸着橫躺在污穢的床上，誰也不知道。可是，常常却有人聽見嗚咽和喘息，直到從後門有一個影子閃出後，一切神秘的聲浪才又沉寂。</p>
<p>這風聲擴大了，有一打左右的青年，在夜半輸流着在她屋裹走動。但當她肚皮發生了一種奇異的變化，而澎漲起來後，就像一雙破草鞋似的被忘掉了。</p>
<p>在一個平和的，溫軟的春夜，有人聽見那屋裹發出一小陣嬰嬰的幼孩哭聲，第二天去看這小生命已經冰冷了，但她還像抱住一個活的似的，偎緊在她赤裸裸的胸前，嘴角浮着從來沒有看過幸福的微笑。</p>

<h3>美國汽車出口業旺盛</h3>
<p>— 可</p>
<p>一九三六年的美國汽車出口業。可說自從一九二九以來。要算這一年頂好的了。因此汽車界中人預測。本年—一九三七年的出口業。也將有很光明的前途哩。據說美國汽車所以出口業旺盛的原因有二。一是對外匯兌的佔優勢。二是百業的恢復繁榮。都是有利於出口業的。而尤其因為把關稅壁壘打倒。而把互惠的商約來代替。便成就了出口業的好轉的現象。</p>
<p>如果回顧到一九二九年的美國汽車海外銷售市塲。我們就可以看出來。那時候的海外銷路是很不壞的。因為連同加拿大的生產額在內。那時候美國的出口數已高至一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛。可是不景氣的來襲。竟使很好的成績。歸為慘敗。在一九三二年的當兒。美國汽軍出口者祇達一八一，二八輛。以視一九二九年的總數。豈不是一落千丈麼。所幸從那年起。情形又漸漸好轉。美國汽車的海外市塲。漸有恢復的希望。直到一九三六年。那出口數已達六〇〇，〇〇〇輛左右。</p>
<p>美國各汽車廠的出口部主任。都有重圖一九二九年好夢的祈望。就是事實上。要達一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇輛的舊地位。倒也是不很簡單的事情。不過。有些人總渴望能達到那一百萬輛的數目。那末這時候在那里呢。據說這時期便是一九三七年了。關於這句話。如果要細釋其原因所在。那末。多數的汽車廠首腦人。很肯定的冀希在一九三七年中。他們的出口數量能增加百分之二十。要求這件事的得告完成。唯一的條件還是要在看他們如何進行。使得在商約上獲得更成功的願望。在美國的許多國外市塲中。南非洲無疑地成為美國汽車的單獨的最大市塲。在去年。美國汽車在那里的銷數。竟超過了任何各地。所以今年大家也對她有十二分的厚望哩。</p>
<p>歐洲方面也有許多美國汽車的好主顧。譬如比利時，荷蘭，和斯干迪那維亞等國。都有很好的市塲。由地德羅直接運輸汽車到腦威，瑞士，和丹麥的。有一種特殊建造的船。他們的航綫是由美國出發。經由大湖而前往。美國汽車的運往法蘭西，意大利，和德國的。現在還不能見到十分上增。這是因為這幾國的關稅壁壘一時尚未攻破的緣故。</p>
<p>澳洲本來是美國汽車的好去處。可是近來改革稅率。對美國汽車車身的進口。限制甚嚴。而且情形緊張。看上去。不久之將來。對於車架也將施以限制。這個條件最受不利的。要算各獨立車廠。至於福特，通用，和克雷斯勒三家。因為他們在澳洲不是自有工廠。便和那地方的車廠訂有契約。還可以不生問題。</p>
<p>關於亞洲方面。中國和印度本來所銷美國汽車。為數不在少數。中國的銷路近來也不壞。印度因為新建道路不少。他日的出口數量。一定可以增加。</p>
<p>在美國以南的許多國家，給予美國汽車以外銷的很好機會。美國和古巴，哥侖比亞，海地，洪特拉士，尼瓜拉格，及巴西等訂立互惠商約。都是很能促進美車外銷的。</p>
<p>美國汽車自改在秋季把新車登塲以來。對於汽車出口業大有得益。美國車商就此便可與法蘭西或英國的汽車。一决雌雄。</p>
<p>在南半球各國。一到春季和夏季的開始。便得購買新車。因為那地方的節季正和美國相反。這裹所應加注意的。去年有一半的美國汽車。是出口到赤道以南的各國。</p>
<p>美國各車廠的出品。都獲得很好的出口業。去年通用和克雷斯勒兩家。尤其出色。通用新廠在林台和紐裘賽的。將以一部份力量專配別克，哇爾特斯摩別爾。和賓塔克等車。以為外銷之用。去年九月和十月兩個月中。派克運出口的汽車為一，二〇〇輛。前年同時僅為三百九十九輛。除此之外。該廠還有許多定貨在趕造中呢。</p>
<h3>威列斯奧佛蘭小型汽車產額增進</h3>
<p>近年來因汽油漲價。造成小型汽車之新出路。蓋小型汽車在駕駛上旣覺輕便。汽油之消費又能節省。歐洲意大利出品之“飛霞脫五〇〇”汽車。業已流行各地。而美國則當以“威列斯奧佛蘭”之小型汽車最受人歡迎。因此出品數量驟增。據最近該廠總理台維特•惠而生氏宣布。自去年十一月三十日至本年二月十五日止。該廠已出有一五一六九輛之多。而尤以最後之半月中。卽一月一日至十五日。計出四五六一輛。較之本年一月份開首之十五日內。增加百分之五十一。計一五五一輛。該項出品已盡數銷售於美國各州。因其價較他車為賤。且其分期付欵時。給價又特廉。以故極受當地人衆之歡迎。每介侖汽油可供三十五英哩之路程。可稱價廉物美。今首批新車行將到滬。屆時必可一獻光彩於滬上。想滬地人士之爭先恐後而往購者。其盛況當可預卜也。</p>
<h3>福特V八新車之全鋼車身特點</h3>
<p>福特汽車製工上從未用過之最大綱鐵壓打板，構成一九三七年式一切福特V八轎式車身之頂部。</p>
<p>此類嶄新福特V八車身。純為綱質。所有車框結構。底板。鑲板。亦皆以綱製成。不獨車項而已。此實為福特公司自數年前採用鋼質車身以來。車身設計方面之最大進步。</p>
<p>龐大之鋼質車頂。起自前屏風。以迄後部車窗之下。兩邊直達車門頂端。及嵌板之邊。純為一氣呵成。又用電氣煆合法。使之與車身機構內部鋼嵌板及鋼底板。聯成巨體。堅強力準確。極盡汽車所能製車身保護力之能事。</p>
<p>車身機構中。無論任何一點。絕不採用木料。卽釘貼裝璜之處。亦不用木。而另以特殊之釘貼原枓代之。</p>
<h3>一年來美國汽車事業概觀</h3>
<p>— 影</p>
<p>光陰過得眞快。剎眼之間。一九三六年度又將全部的過去了。因此。在這歲尾年頭的時節。歐美各國的汽車事業。本年度結果是怎樣。大體上也可以看得出來。而這裹。要為讀者一說的。是一年來美國汽車事業的概况。</p>
<p>在最近的一個年頭之中。說起了美國的汽車事業。又有相當的繁榮。單就商用汽車和貨車說來。各廠在銷數方面。據說自不景氣開始而後。這樣的紀錄。從來不曾有過。本年度貨車的銷數。而且竟超過一九二九年度全盛時代的數字。總之貨車而有這樣的銷數。在美國的汽車史上。從來不曾有過。就美國汽車界事前所憶測者。那麼一九三六年度新貨車的註册數字可達六〇〇，〇〇〇輛。但一九二九年度祇有五二七，〇五七輛。貨車銷售的數字有這樣的高。並不是一件意外的事。因為一九三六年度的開端。銷數的有特殊興旺。早已料到本年度會造成一個最高的紀錄。而且就本年的秋天說來。各個車廠的出品。竟不能供應車商的需要。因為那時候車商之中。多半已存貨都不留了。結果竟使若干車商。因為缺少貨車來出售。所以對於商業方面。也曾一度停止和同業競爭。</p>
<p>美國各廠所產的貨車。顧主方面。比較特別增多的有兩種——就是農人和營造廠。單就農民說來。據說本年度各廠所銷的貨車。四輛之中。有一輛以上由農民購去的。自不景氣開始而後。最壤的幾年。農民們祇可以說購買貨車的完全沒有。雖然有的地方還有少數農民購買牽曳的車輛。為了天時太旱的綠故。大多數的車廠。都說顧客之中。農人已大受影響。幾乎要完全絕跡了。可是本年度情形就不同了。各廠的貨車。都突飛猛進。而主顧方面。農人也佔居了不少。主要的原因。就在農產品售價的抬高。有若干地方。本年更是豐收。因此。農民的購買力也為之增加不少。建築事業的疾速發展。當然也足使貨車的銷數因而增加。營造廠方面對於所訂合同。為趕緊結束起見。多半購買貨車來運送材料。就是經售商品的商人。為了運貨的迅速便利起見。也寗願多費一些錢。購買一輛貨車來運貨。連得經營轉運事業的也為求運本的低廉之故。把小車改換了貨車。所以各汽車廠對於本年度的汽車事業。始終是表示樂觀的。（未完）</p>
<h3>汽車計數機</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>汽車在公路上駛行。如果要在規定的時間。紀錄和算出它經過的輛數。這件事是不很容易做的。美國現在有人發明這樣的一種機器。能在規定的時間中。記出車輛經過的輛數。並且把日子，時間和分數一一記明。此外又能在每一點鐘內。把車輛總數之和紀錄下來。連同時間在內。這機器便是運用電眼的原理而造成的。</p>
<p>這機器的發明者。為美國紐約城的商業機器公司。製造的原理。係包括兩大部份。一部份包括有攝影電管。和兩個攝影鏡頭。另一部份為兩架對放在路旁的光源機。紅外濾清器能使肉眼不見到光綫。因之汽車駕駛者不致受到光綫眩耀的討厭。除了汽車之外。行人走過光綫不發生計數的作用。美國公路當局巳採用此機。作為計算路上車輛的經過數目。</p>

<h3>He Guoguang Discusses Sichuan Province's Sincere Unity with the Central Government</h3>
<p>Liu Xiang Has Already Taken Obedience as His Duty, and Will Surely Show Results in the Shortest Possible Time</p>
<p>[Nanjing] He Guoguang, Acting Director of the Chongqing Provisional Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, came to Nanjing this time with Deng Hanxiang, Secretary-General of the Sichuan Provincial Government, and Lu Zuofu, Director of the Construction Department, to pay their respects to Chairman Chiang and request important instructions. Except for Director Lu, who has gone to Shanghai for business, He and Deng will return to Sichuan after discussing with Minister He of the Ministry of Military Affairs in Nanjing. According to Director He, this trip to Nanjing is to report to the Chairman and request instructions on general affairs of the headquarters. As for Secretary-General Deng and Director Lu of the Sichuan Provincial Government, they are here to study further measures for sincere unity between the central government and the local government from an overall and fundamental perspective. In other words, to promote the nationalization of the army and the unification of politics, and to make the entire national military and political apparatus close-knit and responsive. I have been serving in Sichuan, upholding the spirit of Chairman Chiang's magnanimity and sincerity, and generally adhering to the principles of guiding with virtue and regulating with propriety. Therefore, in the past three years, we have been able to get along with each other and gradually make progress, which I believe is commonly recognized by the people of the country. Although there have been some rumors recently, they are actually exaggerations. Chairman Liu has taken supporting the central government and obeying Chairman Chiang as his duty. Even if there are slight differences of opinion between the central government and the local government, after this study, I believe that he will surely show results to the people of the country in the shortest possible time.

After that, he plans to visit France, Germany, Italy, and other European countries. During his previous trip to Europe, he planned to investigate the political, economic, construction, and industrial conditions of various countries after the war.

In recent years, various countries have made rapid progress in economic construction, which is worthy of our reference. Our country and various European countries have always had very close relations, and we plan to visit them all. Now the domestic financial situation has become stable, but construction still needs to be planned, and it is also necessary to learn from various countries.

The meeting adjourned at 9:20 AM. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] When the Central Government held a memorial service for Deng Zhongyuan's martyrdom, Ju Zheng reported, the gist of his speech was as follows: "Mr. Deng Zhongyuan is a comrade with a long history. His martyrdom was not at the hands of the enemy, but at the hands of those who betrayed the Party and the country. This is not only Deng's misfortune, but also the misfortune of our Party. In the eleventh year of the Republic, the Premier was directing the Northern Expedition in Guilin and ordered Mr. Deng to stay in Guangdong to plan for supplies and weapons. However, Chen Jiongming harbored ulterior motives and wanted to harm him, resulting in the attack at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Station on March 22nd. At that time, the injuries were not fatal, but after being injured, he still mustered the courage to catch the murderer, resulting in excessive blood loss and death. The Premier heard the news and returned to Guangzhou, but the revolution was greatly affected. When we look back on the past, we can see that a comrade's setback is the Party's setback. Today, to commemorate Mr. Deng, we must recognize that it is easy to sacrifice a comrade, but it is very difficult to cultivate a comrade. If sacrificing a comrade has a great impact on the Party, this sacrifice is even greater. To commemorate Deng Gusheng, we must cherish the historical comrades of our Party so that everyone unites as one and cooperates wholeheartedly. Only in this way can the Party be solid, the country be unified, and the nation be revitalized." (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the Issue of Early Independence for the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>In November 1935, the semi-independent government of the Philippines was established, with the intention of formally declaring independence on July 4, 1946. Within ten years, although the Philippines has an autonomous government, major powers such as diplomacy and military affairs, as well as judicial and legislative work, are restricted by the Washington government. Financial and economic aspects are even more restricted. In the past year, Filipino politicians have deeply felt that the road to independence is full of difficulties and the environment is harsh. Therefore, last month, Philippine President Quezon led a delegation to the United States to request President Roosevelt to improve the various relations between the United States and the Philippines. Recently, newspapers have reported that the Philippine President has proposed to realize the independence of the Philippines in the next year or in 1938. What are the reasons for this request from the Filipinos, and what will be the consequences? This is an issue that our countrymen should be concerned about. Let's discuss it further.</p>
<p>The difficult problems that the Philippines is currently facing are economic, social, national defense, and diplomatic, with the economic problem being particularly serious. When the United States first occupied the Philippines, it regarded the Philippines as a source of raw materials and a market for manufactured goods. Sugar, coconut oil, hemp, and tobacco are all needed by the United States. Therefore, Philippine industries are concentrated on these items. At that time, there were no tariff barriers between the United States and the Philippines, while the United States built strict tariff barriers against foreign countries. Therefore, the prices of sugar and oil were high in the United States, and the national economy of the Philippines depended on the United States. The income from sugar and oil was used to purchase American cotton cloth and other goods. Later, domestic sugar and oil capitalists in the United States were tired of the Philippines competing for the American sugar and oil market. Therefore, they mobilized congressmen to advocate for Philippine independence, so that American tariff barriers could be applied to Philippine goods. During the semi-independent period, there was a limit of 850,000 tons of duty-free Philippine sugar imports and 200,000 tons of duty-free coconut oil imports. Additional amounts are gradually taxed, increasing gradually until 1940, when the full statutory tax of the United States will be levied. In other words, the Philippines will gradually lose the market on which its national economy depends and fall into a state of isolation and helplessness.</p>
<p>During the semi-independent period, goods from the United States entering the Philippines are generally tax-free. Therefore, the Philippine market is still occupied by the United States. The current diplomacy of the Philippines is directly supervised and directed by the US government, and all tariff legislation and foreign trade treaties must be approved by the President of the United States. Therefore, the Philippines has no way to conclude favorable tariff treaties with other countries. The Philippines also has no freedom to exchange its domestic market with other countries' markets. Moreover, the international prices of sugar and oil have plummeted. Only the United States has particularly high prices due to tariffs. Philippine sugar, which has very expensive costs, cannot compete with sugar from Java and Cuba in the international market. Sixty percent of the Philippine financial revenue relies on the sugar industry. Ninety-nine percent of Philippine sugar depends on the American market for survival. If there is no way out for sugar, then there is no way out for the national economy of the Philippines. If the United States does not agree to find a solution, then the sugar industry will fail, farmers and workers will lose their jobs, and the Philippines will inevitably fall into the internal turmoil of Cuba. Moreover, the Philippine government has no financial power to borrow money, and everything is restricted by the United States. Under this semi-independent situation, there are more obligations than rights. In terms of freedom, it is insufficient to cope with the environment. In terms of strength, it is insufficient to build independence. This is why Philippine politicians are demanding early independence, and why the US authorities are willing to consider it.</p>
<p>However, the Philippine problem can never be solved by early independence, and the difficulties of the Philippines are by no means limited to the economy. The Philippine economy is not qualified for independent self-existence. Although its land has resources, it is definitely not enough to maintain a fully independent country. Moreover, the construction of basic industry and agriculture is beyond the current resources and manpower of the Philippines. The Philippines is located in the most dangerous environment in the Far East. Japan has coveted this island for more than a day. Economic aggression is even more alarming. Currently, Japanese cotton cloth has gradually replaced American cotton cloth as the clothing of Filipinos. The colonial development of Japan in the Davao region of the southern Philippines has made this region a Japanese prefecture. If this continues, the Philippines will inevitably become a possession of Japan. Therefore, at present, some Filipinos, seeing a bleak future and no good prospects, are learning Japanese and customs in preparation for joining Japan. The trend can be easily imagined.</p>
<p>Currently, the United States is still responsible for the national defense of the Philippines. President Quezon is sparing no expense and is working with American military experts to complete the Philippine defense plan. The United States regards the Philippines as its most important base in the Far East, so it has never taken it lightly. Even after independence, the United States will not abandon its naval base. Therefore, once something happens in the Far East, the Philippines is attacked, the United States cannot help but be drawn into the vortex of war. Will the United States abandon the Far East? Then it should not only grant the Philippines independence immediately, but also fundamentally change its national policy. Even if Japan annexes the Philippines, it may only turn a blind eye. If the United States does not withdraw from the Far East, then it should provide assistance to the Philippine economy and actively prepare without making selfish plans or retreating. You cannot have both fish and bear's paw. May the US and Philippine authorities think carefully about the crossroads.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Discusses North China Smuggling Issue</h3>
<p>Ichinomiya Advocates Assisting China in Anti-Smuggling Efforts; Foreign Minister Desires to Discuss It Together with Tariff Issues</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Today, the House of Representatives Budget Committee convened at 10:38 AM. First, Mr. Masataka Ota of the Seiyukai party questioned the educational policy for Japanese residents in Manchuria.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Sato replied that education is based on the principles of the Imperial Rescript on Education, while considering the special circumstances of Manchuria.</p>
<p>Ota asked about the Sino-Japanese Trade Association held in Shanghai, stating his view that its effectiveness is expected to be minimal. Does the government have significant expectations for it?</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister answered that it is necessary for leading industrialists from both countries to seek friendship personally. He believes it is significant in deepening the understanding of the national conditions of both countries. The delegation should be able to inquire about the actual situation in detail and return. As for the current cabinet's policy toward China, it aims to promote economic and cultural cooperation before political negotiations, which the Chinese side understands very well.</p>
<p>Ota asked whether the Foreign Minister's so-called basic diplomatic work requires separate consideration for North China and South China.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that North China, Central China, and South China must, of course, be considered separately. His so-called basic work, he said, might seem to be replaced by Shidehara diplomacy, but he is considering it based on the current situation, neither actively nor passively, and it is not appropriate to generalize.</p>
<p>Ota asked if Japan has any way to respond to China's five-year plan to progress from an agricultural country to an industrial one. He also believes that China's currency reform has achieved considerable success. Even considering military preparations, domestic economy, and tolerance of communism, China's currency can still be considered to show a relatively solid pace. Regarding this, do Japanese financial institutions and banks intend to dispose of silver reserves?</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that Japan should provide as much assistance as possible to China's five-year economic construction plan. As for the issue of disposing of silver reserves, it should be the same as stated by the Minister of Finance and should be left to the discretion of each bank.</p>
<p>Ota asked, for the sake of Sino-Japanese cooperation, he believes it is necessary to address the tariff issue. What is your view?</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that in order to export products, machinery, and other goods to China, the revision of the Export Guarantee Law should be considered. Due to the development of transportation, there is also a great need for materials, which should also be considered. Therefore, efforts should be made to revise tariffs.</p>
<p>Ota asked regarding economic diplomacy in North China, he believes that full activity is still needed. Therefore, the relationship between investment and exchange control laws must be smoothed as much as possible. What do you think? Also, please explain the special trade situation in North China and other aspects.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that Japan's investment in North China should be welcomed by China. However, it is appropriate to invest in which industry? This matter should be studied in cooperation with the Ministry of Finance. As for special trade, although Japan is not directly involved, it is related to Japan's trade with China. Therefore, it is currently being carefully considered.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee continued its meeting at 1:30 PM. Mr. Fusajiro Ichinomiya (Democratic) asked, regarding the crackdown on special trade in North China, Japan's assistance to China is not only a prerequisite for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, but also a bright attitude for the world. What do you think?</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that he agrees with Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, economic cooperation should be considered comprehensively with political cooperation. The special trade in North China is a matter for the East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council itself, and Japan should not discuss it. However, Japan must consider China's tariff issues together, so careful study is necessary.</p>
<p>Ichinomiya asked if credit facilities for China could be established.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister replied that the improvement of Sino-Japanese economic relations should be based on the establishment of credit facilities as a prerequisite. He is discussing this specific issue with relevant cabinet ministers. Recess at 7:05 PM (Domei News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Siberian Railway to Build Double Tracks</h3>
<p>To be Completed This Year</p>
<p>[Moscow] The second phase of the double-tracking of the Siberian Railway will be completed in 1937. In the past three years, 2,200 kilometers between Kalinskaya and Khabarovsk have been double-tracked. Currently, the second phase between Khabarovsk and Loshino is awaiting laying. Soviet officials specifically stated the economic value of the Siberian Railway, but the laying of double tracks clearly has military significance. During the construction of the double tracks, 63.5 million cubic meters of earthwork were used, and there are thousands of bridges, including several bridges over 1,000 meters in length.

<h3>10,000 Chinese Workers Strike on Malayan Rubber Plantations</h3>
<p>The Trend of Joining is also Present Elsewhere; The Situation is Serious and Difficult to Resolve Temporarily</p>
<p>⊙Kuala Lumpur, Malaya. Ten thousand Chinese workers on rubber plantations in Selangor and Negeri Sembilan declared a strike today. Workers in other places, such as Tamil and Malay, are also joining the trend. The Malayan Federation of Chambers of Commerce has stationed guards to prevent the situation from worsening. The situation in Kuala Lumpur has been very serious recently, as the strikers have considered marching to the capital in formation, but this has not materialized. Judging from the current situation, this strike is considered very serious by both capital and officials, and it is feared that it will be difficult to resolve for the time being.

<h3>Italian Troops Massacre in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Three Young People Die Tragically</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Express recently reported that Mariam, the former representative of Abyssinia to the League of Nations, returned to live in Abyssinia after surrendering to Italy last October. Recently, General Graziani, the Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, was suddenly attacked by natives. Italian soldiers and civilians then carried out a major massacre in retaliation, and Mariam was also killed at that time. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] According to news released by the Abyssinian Embassy here, there was a three-day massacre in Addis Ababa after the assassination of Italian Governor-General Graziani, and three Abyssinian youths who had received higher education in England were also among those killed. It is reported that one of the above three youths was the son of Abyssinian Foreign Minister Hailu, and the other two were the sons of Abyssinian Ambassador to England Martin. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden replied to a question in the House of Commons today, saying that the Abyssinian Emperor recently requested the League of Nations to send personnel to Addis Ababa to investigate the recent massacre by Italian troops. The Foreign Office received a copy of the League of Nations' note this morning and is currently studying it. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister's Annual Salary Increased to 10,000 Pounds</h3>
<p>Cabinet Members to Receive 5,000 Pounds</p>
<p>[London] The British Prime Minister's annual salary is currently 5,000 pounds, but it will soon be changed to 10,000 pounds. The bill has been drafted and is expected to be submitted to Parliament this week. In addition, the annual salaries of other cabinet members will also be changed to 5,000 pounds, except for the Lord Chancellor's current salary of 10,000 pounds, of which 4,000 pounds is the official salary of the Speaker of the House of Lords. The same bill also stipulates a pension of 2,000 pounds per year for former prime ministers. It is said that the second reading of this bill will be personally proposed by Prime Minister Baldwin after Easter, but he declared that he has no intention of accepting the pension, as the Baldwin family is quite wealthy. It is also heard that after the implementation of this bill, all irregular old practices can be abolished, and the transfer of cabinet members will also be more convenient. Among the current cabinet ministers, those with an annual salary of 5,000 pounds include the Prime Minister, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Home Secretary, Secretary of State for War, Foreign Secretary, Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs, Secretary of State for India, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Secretary of State for Air, Minister of Health, President of the Board of Trade, and Minister for Coordination of Defence.

<h3>French Woman Fanty's Bizarre Confession</h3>
<p>Claims to be Mussolini's Mistress</p>
<p>[Paris] Fanty, the French woman who shot former French Ambassador to Italy Chambrun, claimed during her preliminary hearing in court today that she was the mistress of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini from April to July last year. At that time, Mussolini would meet with her regularly, but in July, he suddenly refused to see her. She reported this to Chambrun, who said that Mussolini might be unwilling to attend to other matters because his young son was ill. However, Italian officials later gave her a round-trip plane ticket, saying that she should go to Paris temporarily. She agreed to their request, but when she returned to Rome, she repeatedly sought to see Mussolini but was unable to meet him. She once attempted suicide with sleeping pills but failed. At the same time, the police also found documents proving that Fanty was a French spy. The court has now ordered doctors to investigate whether the woman has a nervous disorder. (National News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>[Paris] The pre-trial judge Gerard continued to interrogate Mrs. Fanty today afternoon regarding her attempted murder of former Ambassador to Italy Chambrun. According to Mrs. Fanty's confession, she met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in Rome in April last year and was scheduled to meet again in July, but she was not summoned by the Italian Prime Minister when the time came. She went to France and visited Ambassador Chambrun, who told her that Mussolini generally did not see guests. She then told Mr. Chambrun an important secret, and after the event, she repeatedly sought to see the Prime Minister and waited for many days before she was able to meet him. Later, Italian Propaganda Minister Alfieri persuaded her to return to France. When she returned to Rome in November last year, she learned that Chambrun had disclosed all the secrets and that all the unfavorable news about her was spread by Chambrun, so she hated him to the bone.

<h3>U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Opposes Roosevelt's Reform Plan</h3>
<p>Denies Court Delays Cases</p>
<p>[Washington] Chief Justice Hughes of the Supreme Court today sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee, formally opposing President Roosevelt's proposal to reform the federal judicial system and increase the number of Supreme Court justices. Hughes denied that the court had delayed cases and said that reorganization might hinder the court's efficiency. Hughes' letter is the first formal criticism of the reform plan by the court. Most of what he said concerned the court's working conditions. Hughes said, "The work of the court is not delayed, and it has been the case for several years. Every time the court adjourns, it can clear all pending cases. The court's powers are originally stipulated by the constitution, part of which is to hear disputes between state governments, and part is to hear appeals from the people. The issue of increasing the number of judges is a matter for the government, and I am unwilling to discuss it. However, it may not necessarily increase efficiency. Moreover, the court's actions are based on a vote of the whole, and increasing the number of people will inevitably cause more delays. If the judges are divided into groups to hear cases, it will be difficult to satisfy people, because most of the cases accepted by the Supreme Court are very important, and the decisions of some judges are difficult to satisfy people. Moreover, the constitution clearly stipulates that the judicial power of the United States belongs only to 'one' Supreme Court." Observers believe that the other eight judges, except for Van Devanter and Brandeis, have the same opinion as the Chief Justice. (National News Agency, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Have Long Established an Understanding on Naval Matters</h3>
<p>British Ambassador to Japan Arrives in the United States to Discuss; Warship Construction Plan Proceeds Rapidly</p>
<p>[New York] The new British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, arrived here today aboard the Queen Mary. It is said that this trip is entirely private. When asked about naval issues, Craigie said that Britain and the United States have long understood each other on naval issues, and will continue to pursue a common policy in the future. Craigie denied that he would go to Washington for a meeting, because as far as naval matters are concerned, a tacit understanding has long been established between Washington and London, and there is no need for his mediation. Mr. Craigie also said that although he is known as a naval expert, his appointment as ambassador to Japan this time has no special significance. Mr. Craigie also said that he will return to his country before the coronation of the British King, and then set off for Japan. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The British naval budget was just passed by Parliament on Thursday night, and on Saturday morning the Admiralty had already signed contracts to build several warships. This is very different from previous procedures, as warship construction contracts have always had to wait for Parliament to approve the naval program five or six months later before they are signed. Several warships approved by Parliament last summer were also contracted out to merchants at the end of the week. Among the ships to be built this time, there are five cruisers. In addition, a 23,000-ton aircraft carrier passed on Thursday was approved on Friday afternoon and will be built by a shipyard in Belfast. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] The U.S. government has signed a contract with the steel industry to supply 7 million tons of steel. Therefore, the Navy Department announced that the warship construction project will no longer feel the lack of steel materials. Seven destroyers and three submarines that have been suspended for a long time will soon be started. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Navy Department recently announced that a part of the 1937-38 warship construction program, namely six destroyers and three submarines, which had been delayed due to a lack of steel materials, will now be started immediately. According to the Special Walsh-Healey Act, factories that do not implement a 40-hour work week are not allowed to accept government orders. Therefore, the steel mills agreed not to accept orders in order to resist. As a result, the naval shipyards lacked steel materials. This is the reason why a part of the 1937-38 warship construction program was delayed. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Senate recently passed the 1937-38 naval budget with 64 votes to 11. The total amount is $523,000,000. Compared with the number voted by the House of Representatives on the 5th of this month, namely $5,160,000,000, there is a difference. It should be sent back to the House of Representatives for reconsideration. The Senate spent three hours discussing this case today and has already completed it. Senator Minton, a Democrat from Indiana, delivered a speech, advocating that the U.S. government should convene a naval conference to discuss arms limitation. According to the 1937-38 naval construction plan, there are two battleships, eight destroyers, and four submarines. In addition, the two main battleships, three aircraft carriers, eighteen cruisers, forty-eight destroyers, and sixteen submarines listed in the 1936-37 warship construction plan have not yet been completed and should continue to be carried out. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The British government, based on Article 4 of the London Treaty, attempted to limit the caliber of main battleship guns to 14 inches and requested the Japanese government to participate in the agreement. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Ministry discussed countermeasures. Recently, they reached a consensus and decided on the content of the reply. It has been approved by the cabinet meeting on the 22nd. Foreign Minister Sato is scheduled to instruct the Japanese ambassador to the UK within days to formally reply to the British government. Japan believes that qualitative restrictions without quantitative restrictions cannot achieve the purpose of arms reduction and intends to refuse to participate in the agreement to limit the caliber of guns. According to Article 4 of the London Treaty, if any one of Japan, the UK, the US, France, and Italy does not participate before April 1 of this year, the method of limiting the main battleship guns can be abolished, and the 16-inch caliber can be adopted as before.

<h3>Mussolini Returns to Rome</h3>
<p>Delivers Another Harsh Speech</p>
<p>[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini returned from the North African colony of Libya aboard the cruiser "Pola." He landed at the port of Gaeta at 3:45 PM, immediately changed to a car, and returned here at 5:00 PM. He immediately went to the Palazzo Venezia and began working with cabinet members. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Rome] Today is the 18th anniversary of the founding of Fascism. Celebrations were held throughout the city. Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a stern speech at the Palazzo Venezia, saying that he had returned from Libya one day earlier than scheduled, but the newspapers considered it a mystery, which was disgusting. Mussolini also replied sharply to the inquiries from the Church of England, saying that this kind of wasting ink is no different from the hypocrisy of missionaries. They are always critical of others, but they themselves have been corrupted for thousands of years. Mussolini then spoke of the nine-month economic blockade, saying that the result was the surrender of the blockaders. The blockade showed that pacifists are the real dangerous enemies of peace. Anyone who says that the Italian people are forgetful has made a big mistake. The Italians waited forty years before avenging the humiliation of Adowa. Mussolini concluded in a grand voice, "Black Shirt Comrades, remember it firmly and prepare everything. This is the warning in today's celebration." (Central News Agency, 23rd, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Germany Lodges Protest with the Pope</h3>
<p>Claims Agreement Will be Terminated</p>
<p>⊙Vatican City. After Pope Pius XI recently issued a letter condemning the German government for violating the 1933 Concordat, the German Ambassador to the Holy See, Pelzer, recently lodged a protest with the Holy See under the instructions of the German government. German sources here also stated that the German government is now considering declaring the Concordat abolished. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Berlin] A semi-official communique was issued today, criticizing the Pope's edict yesterday, calling it "direct interference in Germany's internal affairs." (National News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Yesterday, Pope Pius XI issued a letter criticizing France for violating the 1933 Concordat. All Catholic churches in the country will present and read this letter. Regarding this matter, the French government will decide on its response after the German Ambassador to the Holy See, Pelzer, submits a detailed report on the content of the letter. According to well-informed people, this method can be divided into three types: ① Germany declares its submission and modifies its current religious policy; ② declares the abolition of the Concordat; ③ maintains the status quo without legally breaking with the Holy See. The first method is tantamount to abandoning the important doctrines contained in the book "Mein Kampf," which cannot be accepted by the National Socialist government. Once the second method is implemented, 20 million Catholics in the country will follow the Pope's orders and rise up to fight against the government, which will inevitably cause serious disputes, which the National Socialist government does not want to see. Therefore, judging from the situation, the third method is more credible. (Central News Agency, 22nd, Havas)</p>
<h3>U.S. Elementary School Explosion Tragedy; Principal Faints from Grief During Questioning</h3>
<p>Misuse of Gas Pipes to Heat the Room Causes the Disaster</p>
<p>⊙New London. In the case of the elementary school explosion here last Wednesday, the school principal, Mr. Shaw, suddenly fainted today while being questioned in court, because he was weak and overly saddened. At that time, Shaw had admitted that he was responsible for the incident, because he used a certain gas pipe to heat the room without the clear permission of the oil company. According to the foreman of the Parratte Gas Company, the company did not allow anyone to connect the school's gas pipe to the company's residual gas pipe. The school's gas pipe is still being inspected to find the cause of the explosion. Shaw's son also died in the explosion. After fainting in the witness box today, he was carried out of the courtroom.

<p>[London] After King Leopold III of Belgium arrived here yesterday, it is reported that he held secret talks with Foreign Secretary Eden last night. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the relationship between Italy and Yugoslavia, rumors that the two sides intend to establish a gentleman's agreement have been denied by the authorities. However, Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano is scheduled to go to the capital of Yugoslavia on the 25th of this month. (Central News Agency, 23rd, Havas)</p>

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Air Force Budget</h3>
<p>Labour Party Amendment Rejected</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons today rejected the Labour Party's amendment to the Air Force budget with 202 votes to 106. The gross budget for the Air Force is £18,588,600, and the net budget is £56,500,000, which is £32 million more than last year. During the debate, Minister for Coordination of Defence Inskip replied that the government's military buildup plan is not related to the recent scramble for goods. The scramble for goods is due to world demand and the industrial recovery of the United States, which has led to a sudden shortage of goods. However, the UK had already seen this and had signed contracts in advance. Therefore, the surge in prices has no impact on the contracts signed by the British government, and there will be no impact in peacetime in the future. Churchill said that the number of British aircraft is less than that of other countries, but Inskip said that the government's original plan was to establish 100 aircraft squadrons by mid-April this year. But this level has been slightly exceeded, because on April 1 this year, the UK established 103 aircraft squadrons. However, in terms of equipment, the UK has not yet reached its intended level.

<h3>Tumultuous Situation in Spain Continues</h3>
<p>British House of Commons Discusses Italian Troops Assisting in War; Non-Intervention Committee Extended Again</p>
<p>[London] The British government recently received information that on March 5th, a batch of Italian volunteers landed at the port of Cadiz in southern Spain. Because this action violated the February 20th agreement prohibiting volunteers from joining the Spanish conflict, negotiations were initiated with the Italian government. Italy has now submitted an official reply. According to responsible sources, the reply stated that on March 5th, an Italian steamer did arrive at the port of Cadiz, but it carried only a number of volunteer members of a medical corps and medical supplies. The reply did not specify the number of team members. (Havas News Agency dispatch from Havana on the 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] During today's session in the House of Commons, a member inquired about the withdrawal of foreign troops from Spain. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the British government had previously sent notes to the German and Italian governments, requesting a ban on sending foreigners to Spain to participate in the war. Both countries subsequently replied with suggestions. Lord Plymouth had mentioned this matter in the Non-Intervention Committee based on these suggestions, and it is currently under discussion by a necessary committee. A member also asked whether the landing of Italian troops in Spain before February 20th, carrying guns and ammunition to fight against the legitimate government of that country, violated the Non-Intervention Agreement, the Paris Pact, the League of Nations Covenant. The Foreign Secretary replied that if the question referred to the Italian army, then he had not received confirmation of the landing of such troops in Spain. In any case, the issue of violating the Non-Intervention Agreement is a matter for the Non-Intervention Committee itself to consider. As for the other parts of the question, he was not in a position to express an opinion. (Reuters dispatch from London on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Rome] British Ambassador Sir Drummond visited Foreign Minister Count Ciano yesterday, but according to well-informed sources, the ambassador did not lodge a protest with the Foreign Minister regarding the recent landing of Italian volunteers at a Spanish seaport.

<h3>Japanese Researchers Successfully Develop Fiber from Soybean Hulls</h3>
<p>Beneficial for Military Industrial Needs</p>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: The South Manchuria Railway Central Experiment Station has successfully completed research on extracting fiber from soybean hulls produced in Northeast China. It has been confirmed that fiber of 30 to 40 quality can be extracted, and this is also beneficial to the military industry. However, the problem remains that the soybean hulls in Northeast China are mostly used as fuel by farmers during the winter. The question is how to collect a large quantity. The Agriculture and Forestry Section of the South Manchuria Railway's Industrial Department is currently studying an economical collection method. After the study is completed, the location for collecting raw materials will be examined, and then the factory construction site will be determined.</p>
<h3>Amoy Dutch Ship Sinks Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>One Death, Losses of Two Thousand Yuan; Java Company Still Denying</p>
<p>Amoy Correspondence: On the 13th, the Amoy Maritime Workers' Union received a report from Zhang Ronghui, a net fishing worker, that on the 9th, he was piloting the fishing boat No. 0928 to Dadan (Amoy port) to cast nets for fishing. On the evening of the 11th, the cook Xie Tianxiang was on watch on the deck. At 3:00 AM on the 12th, the Java Company's MV Wanfushi entered the port from outside, ignoring the port route and heading directly towards the fishing boat. Xie shouted for help on the deck, but the ship ignored him. The fishing boat's nets were in a fixed location and could not be moved to avoid it, causing it to be hit and sunk. Xie Tianxiang fell into the sea and drowned. His body was later recovered with fishing nets. He and another worker escaped from the bottom of the cabin. Because the bow of the boat did not sink, they clung to it until dawn, when they were rescued and taken back by Yu Wendeng's fish transport boat. The wrecked ship sank at that location, with material losses amounting to approximately two thousand yuan. A request was made for assistance in negotiations. The union immediately sent personnel to accompany the water police and the court to Shapotou to inspect Xie's body and sent representatives to negotiate with the Java Company's Chinese comprador, He Fuqing. According to the latter, the ship did not sink a fishing boat that night, and there were other ships entering the port at the same time, such as the Xinhai Men, Taiyuan, and Haiting, so a careful investigation was necessary. On the 14th, the Maritime Workers' Union held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss the matter. It was pointed out that the MV Wanfushi was scheduled to depart for Nanyang on the 14th, and maritime workers would boycott it and not carry passengers or cargo. Later, it was decided that the customs office had records of the ship's time of entry, so the company could not deny it. A report should be submitted to the city party headquarters and the municipal government for negotiations. On the 15th, the Dutch consul visited Mayor Li Shilin and denied that the fishing boat was sunk by the MV Wanfushi, and the Java Company would not bear any responsibility. Li replied that he had not yet received a report from the boat union and that the truth was not clear. On the 17th, the Amoy Customs Chief Inspector, together with representatives from the Maritime Workers' Union, conducted a detailed on-site investigation. As a result, sufficient evidence was obtained to confirm the facts, and a report was submitted to the Customs Commissioner for handling. The Maritime Workers' Union also decided on the same day to send a letter to the Java Company, setting out the conditions required. If there was no satisfactory reply within two days, effective measures would be taken. (March 19)</p>
<h3>Shandong Province Strives for Rural Construction</h3>
<p>Actively Training Rural Service Personnel; Rural Construction Vocational School to Be Improved</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: In recent years, Governor Han of Shandong Province has been striving for rural construction, recognizing that the countryside is the foundation of the nation. To ensure the long-term stability of the country, it is necessary to start with rural construction, enlighten its intelligence, tighten its organization, restore its economic condition, and increase its self-defense capabilities, aiming for prosperity and strength. Those in charge of this matter include Liang Shuming, Liang Zhonghua, Tang Maoru, etc. All work, such as establishing administrative inspectorate districts, promoting rural agricultural schools and village agricultural schools, etc., has now achieved results in education and self-defense. Seven special commissioner districts have been established, incorporating 68 counties, and are actively in progress. However, there is a great lack of personnel for this rural service, and even with intensified training, the supply still falls short of demand. The current status of the three institutions for training rural service personnel, the Rural Construction Research Institute, the Rural Service Personnel Training Center, and the Rural Construction Vocational School, is described as follows: The Rural Construction Research Institute is located in Zouping, headed by Liang Shuming, with a branch in Heze. The institute is divided into a research department and a training department. Graduates of the institute have long been assigned to rural service in various counties of the first, second, and third administrative districts and have achieved considerable success. Subsequently, two rural construction normal schools were established in Zouping and Heze counties to cultivate teachers and continue to distribute them for service.</p>
<p>Rural Service Training Center: Last year, due to the lack of rural service personnel, the provincial government established the Rural Service Training Center for Normal Students in Jining, gathering graduating public and joint normal school students to provide short-term training. Another training center for female normal school students was established in Zouping to train female students. After training, they were assigned to practice in rural areas. The newly established fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh administrative inspectorate districts and counties are promoting rural agricultural schools, mostly served by graduates of this program. The Normal School Student Training Center has now been reorganized into the Rural Service Personnel Training Center, as a permanent institution, headed by Governor Han himself as the director.</p>
<p>Rural Construction Vocational School: This school was formed by merging the Rural Normal School and the Senior Agricultural Vocational School, and the principal is Tang Maoru. It was established last year. According to regulations, when each province establishes a vocational school, it must first determine the curriculum and report it to the Ministry of Education for approval before recruiting students. The school did not submit the curriculum last year and first recruited 100 students. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education did not approve it, so only 13 people were recruited. Two people did not arrive at the start of the semester, and others gradually withdrew, so there are only eight people now. Recently, Xie Shuying, a supervisor from the Ministry of Education, came to Jinan to inspect higher education and first paid attention to the school. Because the school had too few vocational students, but the faculty and staff numbered 17, with annual expenses of 50,000 yuan, it was too uneconomical. Furthermore, the curriculum of the school's rural normal school, senior agricultural school, and rural construction vocational school was not well-integrated, and there were criticisms. Improvements were urged to be made quickly. (March 22)</p>

<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Planning for Wheat Crop Competition</p>
<p>The Kunshan Agricultural Promotion Office has decided to hold a county-wide wheat crop competition in early May.

After farmers register to participate, their competition wheat fields will be marked for identification. At that time, the judges will depart to conduct on-site inspections to assess the results. Preparations are actively underway.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Western Clothing Industry Petitions for Relief</p>
<p>The Suzhou County Western Clothing Industry Association reported that since silk and cloth shops established western clothing departments, their business has been encroached upon and they have been affected. Now, the secondhand clothing shops are also making and selling western clothes at low prices. For the sake of the livelihood of over a thousand workers, they request assistance. The association convened a meeting and decided to appoint Chairman Li Zengyong and others to petition the county party headquarters on the 12th. On the 23rd, they went to the county chamber of commerce to request relief. In order to resolve the dispute, the chamber of commerce decided to convene responsible persons from both sides to the meeting at 10:00 AM today (24th) to inquire about the details and then handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>Suzhou-Wuxi Road Commercially Operated Transportation</p>
<p>After the completion of the Suzhou-Wuxi Highway, the Provincial Highway Department began a trial operation on February 1st. For over a month, the business has been good. It is now learned that the road has been contracted by Suzhou and Wuxi merchants with a capital of 200,000 yuan. The Suzhou-Wuxi Long-Distance Bus Company has been established and has signed a contract with the Department of Construction for a term of 30 years. Important officials include Li Genyuan and others. Preparations are currently underway, and the official opening is scheduled for mid-April. It is said that the ticket prices will be slightly different from the trial period.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob Small Ferry</p>
<p>In order to facilitate passengers, the Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company has specially opened a joint ferry service between Hujia Ferry in the fifth district and Qianzhou, running four times a day to pick up and drop off passengers. One day at 6:00 PM, the small ferry departed from Hujia Ferry to Qianzhou as usual. Around 7:00 PM, when it arrived at Zhongqiao Wharf, two bandits suddenly disguised themselves as passengers and claimed that they needed to go to Zhang Dadi Temple in Xitang, Qianzhou, to watch a play. The driver of the boat did not suspect anything. When the boat approached the Yangchepeng area, the bandits pulled out handguns and fired two shots into the river as a warning, prohibiting anyone from making a sound. They then carried out a large-scale robbery. As a result, none of the twenty or so passengers were spared. Those who were wearing expensive clothes were stripped of them. The total loss amounted to over two hundred yuan. After obtaining the stolen goods, the bandits jumped ashore and fled towards Qianzhou. On the morning of the 22nd, the Xicheng Company reported the incident to the County Police Bureau for investigation. It was found that the small ferry had been robbed once before on the 7th of this month at Linzhuang Bridge. This was the second time. The future of public security is worrying.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Construction of Riverside Wharves</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Department of Construction believes that the construction of important riverside wharves is of great importance to local transportation. The province's Jiangbei and Jiangnan areas are separated by the Yangtze River, which makes it very inconvenient to implement government orders and transport goods. It is planned to build deep-water docks in Yangzhou and Kouan in Jiangbei, as well as Zhenjiang's riverside, and to manufacture car ferry boats, so that the Jiangnan and Jiangbei highways can be connected to each other.</p>
<p>Control of Cotton Seeds in Reclamation Areas</p>
<p>In order to increase production and eliminate inferior varieties, the Jiangsu Province Cotton Production Improvement Office will implement control of cotton seeds in reclamation areas this year. It has selected excellent cotton seeds from various cotton areas in Henan and Shandong and transported them back, and formulated measures to lend them out separately. The seeding has been allocated by area and zones, and model cotton production areas will be established in Nantong's Sanyu Town Dayou Jin District, Dongtai's Xinfeng Town, Dafeng District, and the Yancheng-Nantong University base production area to further promote cotton planting.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Adding Culverts to the Hangzhou-Cao Section</p>
<p>Due to the construction of over 70 bridges along the Hangzhou-Cao section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, disputes have arisen with local areas over the water drainage issue. The government authorities have now invited local gentry and business leaders to discuss and resolve the issue. It has been decided to add six culverts to facilitate water drainage and benefit farmland. However, the location still needs to be determined with local consultation. The steel rails for this section are being transported from Shanghai to Hangzhou for installation by the construction department. It is planned to start paving in four sections in order to complete it as soon as possible.</p>

The exhibition is scheduled to last for two weeks, after which it will be transported to Beijing for exhibition.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>The Danger of the Entire Nansha Area</p>
<p>The Zhushan to Renshan area in the eastern countryside of Xiaoshan has suffered from tidal disasters for many years. During the 14th year of the Republic of China, Shen Dingyi proposed building a dike to resist the tides and building a diversion dam in Renshan. The force of the Qiantang River was diverted northward, so tens of thousands of acres of new sand land were added. Later, a second earthen dike was built outside the old dike. Until last year, local gentry and others from Kanshan built a third earthen dike on the newly accreted sand land. Recently, there have been continuous spring rains, and the upper river flow is pouring down, causing severe erosion. The newly built earthen dike has begun to collapse. Generally ignorant people are still planting crops in the old dike area, loosening the sides of the dike. Once the dike body is loose, the river water will inevitably enter the interior, and the harm will be great. Recently, it has had a considerable impact on the entire Nansha area. In the future, it may become a place for fish and turtles.</p>

The central government has its own considerations in replacing high officials, but we believe that Shanghai is at the forefront of the Jianghai and has always been a bustling place. We sincerely request that you consider the special circumstances and withdraw the order. We cannot help but hope and pray. We respectfully telegram to you and respectfully ask for your consideration. The Shanghai Local Association, respectfully.</p>

<p>Telegraphed to Beijing yesterday, saying: To the Nanjing Central Political Committee and the Executive Yuan, Since Mayor Wu Tiecheng took office in Shanghai and presided over municipal administration, it has been more than six years. He has straightened out discipline and clarified laws. He has displayed grand plans for developing prosperity and utilization, and he has shouldered the heavy responsibility of delegating great responsibilities. His plans have been welcomed by the people, and his reputation has grown daily. The people's livelihood has been entrusted to him. Just as we were hoping for gradual progress, so that he could fulfill his talents, we recently learned that the central government has issued an order to transfer him to govern Guangdong. The people of Shanghai are deeply disturbed. We believe that Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreign commerce converges. In terms of geography, it supports the capital. In terms of finance, it is the economic center of the country. Not to mention the dense population of commoners, workers, and merchants, it is not enough to govern this place without a person who is wholeheartedly devoted, and has the talent to manage ten thousand affairs. Since Mayor Wu has been in Shanghai, he has prospered the city and established industry and commerce. His political achievements have been recognized both at home and abroad. Now, if he is transferred suddenly, the interconnected facilities will inevitably be changed, and the great achievements of past management will be feared to be abandoned at once. Therefore, without avoiding offense, we earnestly express our words. We respectfully request that you comply with public opinion and withdraw the order, and appoint another high official to preside over Guangdong. In haste, we cannot express enough the extent of our apprehension and anticipation. The Shanghai Postal Workers Union, respectfully.</p>

<h3>Grand Geshe of Tibet, Shira Gyatso, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Invited to Beijing to lecture at Five Universities</p>
<p>Special Report from This Newspaper: In order to facilitate communication between Tibetan and Han cultures, the central authorities have specially invited the Grand Geshe (equivalent to a Ph.D. title) Shira Gyatso of the Zhepang Monastery in Tibet (formerly translated as Xi Dan Jia Su) to Beijing to lecture at the Central University, Peiping University, Wuhan University, Zhongshan University, and Tsinghua University. He arrived in Shanghai the night before last aboard the British ship "Jahana" with a group of 21 people, including Li Dan of the Supervisory Committee, the Mongolian-Tibetan pilgrimage delegation he organized, his disciple Guanba Serkhutuktu, Geshe Garsang Gyatso, Dalai Lama's Gujiatutannanzhuo, and Supervisory Committee member Li Dan. Due to the long journey, Mr. Xi is resting in Shanghai for a day. Because of the importance attached to Mr. Xi's visit, visitors have been arriving all day, especially groups of reporters, leaving Grand Master Xi and Committee Member Li with little rest. Mr. Li's secretary, Yang Zhifu, has been particularly busy, translating for the Grand Master and talking to reporters from various newspapers, with almost no time to spare. During Mr. Yang's busy schedule, the writer was able to speak freely. What was discussed is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Shira Gyatso</h3>
<p>Brief Biography of Mr. Shira: Grand Master Shira Gyatso is originally from Qinghai. He went to Tibet at a young age and became a famous Tibetan master. His writings and morals are highly respected by the Tibetan people, and he has more than 10,000 disciples. He is famous throughout Tibet and has a considerable status in the world.</p>
<p>Journey Schedule: He set off from Tibet on February 8th, arrived in India on February 24th, sailed from India on February 28th, arrived in Hong Kong on March 16th, and sailed from Hong Kong on the 19th, arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The journey took more than one and a half months.</p>
<h3>Li Dan</h3>
<p>Meeting Foreign Guests En Route: During Mr. Xi's trip to Beijing, when he passed through Kalimpong, India, British expert on Tibetan affairs, McDonald, came to visit. When he arrived in Calcutta, the Indian International University held a special welcome meeting and invited him to visit the school. He was also invited by the bhikkhunis of the Indian Buddhist organization Maha Bodhi Society to give a sermon. When he visited the sacred sites of Buddhagaya (the place called Vajrasana, where Sakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment) and boarded the ship from Calcutta, Sir Francis Younghusband, who led the British expeditionary force into Tibet in the Jia Chen year of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty, personally boarded the ship to visit and said to Mr. Jia, "We have organized this travel association to come to India specifically to study Buddhism, because the world today is full of wars and unrest, and there is no peace. Only by promoting Buddhism can we save the world from this catastrophe. We deeply hope that Buddhism will be widely promoted to save the world. It would be a great honor for Grand Geshe to visit England, and we will pray for it." At the same time, American scholar Mr. Theos C. Bernard also came to the ship to request an audience and said, "The United States also highly respects Buddhism now and hopes that Grand Geshe will visit the United States to widely promote Buddhism for the benefit of all beings." The Geshe replied, "I also wish to visit your country. Your visit is truly a good opportunity, because the phrase 'do no harm to sentient beings' is not only for world peace, but also what my Buddha preaches. Whether I am in Tibet, in China, or in my hometown preaching, I always take this as my firm and unchangeable principle. I have long wanted to visit your country, but I have not been able to go due to circumstances, which I regret." He then left his contact information, hoping to communicate often.</p>
<p>Grand Master's Sermon: Reporters from various newspapers asked Grand Master Shira Gyatso to talk about the history of Tibetan culture. The Grand Master straightened his yellow robe, sat down, and spoke in Tibetan, which was translated by Mr. Yang Zhifu. The main points are recorded below:</p>
<p>Relationship between Han and Tibet: Buddhism originated with the incarnation of Sakyamuni Buddha and first flourished in India. Therefore, India can be said to be the birthplace of Buddhism. It was introduced to China during the Han Dynasty and to Tibet during the Tang Dynasty. The beginning of the introduction of Buddhism into Tibet was the time when Chinese Buddhism flourished. After the Song Dynasty, Chinese Buddhism gradually declined, and Tibetan Buddhism revived. At the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty, Sakya Banqing of Tibet and his nephew Pagpa were invited, and relations with the Sakya sect developed. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, Halima and others were invited, and relations with the Kagyu sect developed. At the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, the new sect of Tibetan Buddhism (the Yellow Sect) was revitalized. Emperor Chengzu of the Ming Dynasty invited the founder of the new sect, Grand Master Tsongkhapa, but the Grand Master was unable to come in person and sent his chief disciple, Sakya Yeshe, leading to relations with the new sect. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the Fifth Dalai Lama came to China, and the relationship with the new sect of Tibetan Buddhism became even deeper, and politically they were united as one. It has been like this for 600 years. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, many Tibetan scholars have come to the mainland, but I am the first to be formally invited by the central government. Therefore, I can truly be said to be the first. This is the general situation of the relationship between Buddhism and the Han and Tibetan peoples.</p>
<p>Significant Significance: I feel that this invitation from the central government is of great significance, because from the beginning of the Yuan Dynasty to the end of the Qing Dynasty, they were all "imperial teachers" or "national teachers." Because the Tibetans came to the mainland and lived in the palace, preaching to one person, the relationship was extremely small. This time, I was ordered by the central government to lecture at five national universities, which is truly to facilitate communication between Tibetan and Han cultures. Although I am an unlearned person, I will make efforts to promote this as my goal in the future.</p>
<p>Not a Representative: I am very surprised that the newspapers in this city report that I am a representative of the Hotreng Khutuktu of Tibet. This news is not only untrue, but I have never even dreamed of it. Please pay attention to this point.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's Remarks: After the Grand Master finished speaking, the writer asked Supervisory Committee member Li Dan about his trip to the west. Mr. Li is 67 years old this year and is in unusually good spirits. According to him, the Mongolian-Tibetan pilgrimage delegation he organized took four years, including the journey. When they went, they passed through Gansu and Qinghai to Tibet, which took a year. They traveled through hundreds of miles of uninhabited areas. It took three months to travel from Gansu to Tibet. Fortunately, they had animals to ride on the way. After arriving in Tibet, they immediately engaged in research on Tibetan culture with Shira Gyatso. (The rest is omitted)</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Hosted Lunch and Dinner Yesterday for the German and Japanese Consuls General</h3>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a lunch at his residence yesterday to bid farewell to the German Consul General in Shanghai, Kriebel, who is about to return to his country, and his wife. In the evening, he also hosted a dinner at his residence for the Japanese Consul General Kawasai to socialize. High-ranking officials from the consulates and city government officials were invited to accompany them, and the atmosphere was extremely pleasant.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Factory Representatives Petition in Beijing</h3>
<p>Submitting to the Relevant Ministries and Departments</p>
<p>According to reports, the Chinese Cigarette Factory Association is concerned about the possibility of increased taxes. Since this concerns national tax revenue and the survival of the industry, an emergency meeting was convened in the association yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Representatives from various factories attended, including Hua Cheng Shen Xingde, Cui Zhong Shen Weiting, Wang Ruilin, Hua Mei Jing Yimeng, Sun Daosheng, Fu Xin Ge Xiongfu, Qiu Tanglin, He Xing Wu Linzhe, Nanyang Liang Zhidong, Hua Pin Gu Zhongying, Li Xing Bao Gengsheng, Jiang Zhe Liu Jiyun, Da Dong Sun Lishan, Da Dongnan Zhang Xinliang, Hua Dong Li Xuedong, De Long Wang Weiguan, De Xing Le Nanting, Zhong He Yu Banqin, Rui Lun Wang Xingtang, and Zhong Nan Shen YanKang. Chairman Shen Weiting presided over the meeting. Proposition 1: In light of recent reports of further tax increases, how should we respond? Decision: At present, smuggled cigarettes are rampant, and the timing is especially inappropriate for further tax increases during the rainy season. Representatives should be sent to Beijing to petition the Central Political Council, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Tax Administration to maintain the status quo and avoid tax increases. Shen Xingde, Shen Weiting, Jing Yimeng, Liang Zhidong, Bao Gengsheng, and Ge Xiongfu were appointed as representatives to petition in Beijing that evening. Proposition 2: Should the date of this year's annual members' meeting be postponed? Decision: This year's annual members' meeting was originally scheduled for April 10th, but during this period of tax increases, the members are very busy and have no time for this. It should be postponed, and the date of the meeting will be determined later.</p>
<h3>British Acting Consul General Davidson Has Assumed Office</h3>
<p>After Sir Brenan returned to England, the position of British Consul General in Shanghai was taken over by I.W.O. Davidson as Acting Consul General. Mr. Davidson has already assumed office and has notified the Municipal Council.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Board of Directors Will Discuss Increasing the General Rate Today</h3>
<p>Chinese Directors Met Yesterday to Discuss Rejecting the Proposal; All Sectors Expressed Strong Opposition</p>
<p>According to the New Voice Society, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession has been planning to increase the municipal general rate by 16 percent for a long time. All sectors are deeply concerned that once this is implemented, they will not be able to bear the burden and have expressed their opposition. However, the Municipal Council has not withdrawn this proposed tax increase. It is now known that the council will discuss and decide on this matter at today's board meeting, and it seems determined to implement it. Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, Guo Shun, and Xu Xinliu, the Chinese directors attending the Municipal Council, attach great importance to this matter. They held a meeting yesterday evening, but the content is unknown. However, if the issue of tax increase is raised at today's board meeting, the Chinese directors will have a serious debate in order to reject the proposal, which can be inferred. It is subtly rumored that the Japanese directors also hold an opposing attitude and are very determined.</p>
<p>Various Trade Associations Strive on Just Grounds</p>
<p>More than 150 trade associations in the city, including real estate, new medicine, pharmaceutical, tea, soy sauce, southern goods, salted fish, timber, fruit, jewelry, seafarers, Western clothing, cosmetics, Chinese and foreign groceries, and more than ten native place associations such as Nantong, Haimen, Jiading, Ningbo, Zhenjiang, and Sichuan, jointly sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday, stating that the Municipal Council's attempt to increase the municipal general rate at this time is tantamount to deliberately harming industry and commerce, making it impossible for the market to improve. The council should recognize that many residents are unable to pay the house rate quarterly and are accumulating arrears, and the number of cases being filed in the courts is increasing daily. If the Municipal Council implements the tax increase, industry and commerce will decline, and vacant houses will increase, which will not benefit the revenue, but will only increase the suffering of the citizens. Therefore, if the Municipal Council sincerely wants to solve the financial difficulties, it should thoroughly eliminate waste in expenditure and implement austerity. As far as we know, the exchange allowance given to Western employees of the council amounts to more than 1.6 million yuan per year, the music team costs 260,000 yuan per year, and the unnecessary White Russian team in the International Settlement Volunteer Corps also costs 170,000 yuan per year. The police expenses of the police department were 5.58 million yuan in 1929, and have increased to 9.9 million yuan this year, an increase of 4 million yuan in these years, which is shocking. Moreover, if the council could employ more Chinese employees, the savings in expenditure would be even more considerable. However, the council does not consider this and wants to solve the financial difficulties by increasing taxes. Not to mention that this policy of seeking fish from trees is of no practical benefit, but will only cause unfortunate serious consequences, so we must warn the council in advance and urge them to strive on just grounds and not allow it to become a reality.</p>
<p>Sub-Districts Resolutely Oppose</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Association, upon learning that the Municipal Council intends to increase the municipal general rate, issued a declaration stating the reasons why the tax increase should not be implemented, requesting the Municipal Council to prioritize the livelihood of the citizens and withdraw the proposed tax increase. However, the Municipal Council has not adopted any expression. It is now known that all sub-districts of the association will issue a joint declaration within the day, absolutely supporting the association's position and firmly expressing their opposition.</p>
<h3>People from All Walks of Life Support Zhongshan Hospital</h3>
<p>Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital is scheduled to hold an opening ceremony at its Maple Bridge site on April 1st of this year. Recently, many enthusiastic sponsors from all walks of life have donated souvenirs and supplies, including a refrigerator from Wing On Company, an electric stove for the kitchen from Mr. Anderlo, a velvet curtain for the auditorium from the graduating students of the National Shanghai Medical College, a piano from the students in school, a Cantley &amp; Eltor wireless radio, a plaque from Minister Kong Yongzhi, 500 yuan in national currency from Shanghai Cement Company, 500 yuan for the purchase of dining utensils from the Chinese Medical Association, a full set of wooden furniture for the reception room from Sen Tai Construction Company, a short-wave electrotherapy device from Dr. Niu Huisheng and his wife (loaned), ophthalmological equipment from China Optical Company, bedding from the Chinese Women's Association, kitchen utensils from Mr. Zou Gengsheng, a carpet from Mrs. Lan Ansheng, a full set of sterilizers from Harmon &amp; Co., 200 yuan in national currency from Ren Li Earth Carpet Company, and a cylinder of a laughing gas for the anesthesia room from Sin Yi Pharmaceutical Factory.

<h3>Municipal Party Department Held a Memorial Meeting for the Martyrdom of Deng Zhongyuan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Attended by More Than 100 Representatives from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Department convened representatives from all walks of life yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to hold a memorial meeting for the 15th anniversary of the martyrdom of Mr. Deng Zhongyuan, presided over by Xing Wan, a member of the Municipal Party Department.

The entire city flew flags at half-mast to express grief.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the chairman, Xing Wan, led the ceremony, Xing Wan gave a report, stating that Mr. Deng Zhongyuan died for the revolution and sacrificed himself for the country 15 years ago today. Among the deeds of Mr. Deng's life, what is most admirable is his revolutionary spirit, his love of learning, his integrity, and his love of the party. These four spirits should be emulated by all our comrades. Now that the country is engaged in the great task of recovery, all our compatriots should emulate Mr. Deng's spirit to make the country and the nation prosperous and strong, so that we can live up to the meaning of commemorating Mr. Deng today.</p>
<p>Memorial Slogans: After the chairman's report, the slogans were shouted: (1) The spirit of Mr. Deng Zhongyuan will never die! (2) Emulate Mr. Deng's great personality! (3) Inherit Mr. Deng's revolutionary spirit! (4) Long live the Three Principles of the People! (5) Long live the Chinese Kuomintang! (6) Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<h3>Kodama Kenji Expressed Regret After the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun Published an Editorial</h3>
<p>In Reality, Both Sides' Opinions Were Very Harmonious</p>
<p>Kodama Kenji, who came to China to discuss Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, spoke about the editorial published by the Asahi Shimbun yesterday morning, saying, "The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published an editorial on the 22nd entitled 'Adjusting the Problems of Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Relations.' Although I have not seen the full text, based on the telegram from the Allied News Agency, its content is completely contrary to the impressions and conversations we had in Nanjing and Shanghai. I think the newspaper's editorial is based on speculative opinions, and I am very concerned that it will cause misunderstandings among the general public, which is quite regrettable. In fact, the talks between the two sides were very harmonious, and the future effects can be fully expected." Kodama went out to visit friends yesterday morning and also attended social events. He is scheduled to return to China on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Kato Went North Yesterday Morning to Investigate; Japanese Investigation Team Disbanded</h3>

<h3>Municipal Police Department Granted Permission by Military Commission to Continue Citywide Registration of Opium Smokers</h3>
<p>Opium Smokers Found to Have Harmful Additives Sent to Relevant Departments for Legal Action; Fourth Phase of License Renewal Scheduled to Begin on the First of Next Month</p>
<p>According to the Ta Kung She, Dai Lizhen, the chief of the Anti-Opium Section of the Police Department, stated yesterday that since the department began registering opium smokers on April 1st of the year before last, a total of more than 40,000 opium smokers have been registered. The department has issued licenses and gradually reduced the amount of opium they smoke in accordance with the law. However, since the registration ended at the end of December last year, in recent times, the various police sub-bureaus have found a large number of opium smokers without licenses, and due to the administrative relations of the concessions, they cannot implement prosecution. In order to be tolerant of opium smokers without licenses and give them an opportunity to reform, the bureau has obtained the approval of the Chief Supervisor of the Anti-Opium General Supervision Department of the Military Commission to continue the registration of opium smokers. They are currently preparing the registration procedures, which are expected to begin next month.</p>
<p>Additives Verified in Opium Smokers Who Have Quit</p>
<p>The work of testing opium smokers who have quit began at the beginning of this month. The Anti-Opium Section of the bureau has tested and forced rehabilitation on more than 18,000 opium smokers. They first identified 2,000 people and ordered the bureaus and sub-bureaus to test them separately. It is said that after the test, more than 20 people were found to have harmful non-addictive substances, and they have been sent to the garrison headquarters for punishment in accordance with military law. As for the second phase of testing, it is scheduled to begin on the first of next month.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Begin Exchanging Licenses</p>
<p>The fourth phase of licenses for registered opium smokers will expire at the end of this month. The Anti-Opium Section of the bureau has numbered the more than 40,000 registered opium smokers and indicated the amount of opium they smoke, and will begin exchanging licenses on April 1st. At that time, opium smokers will be notified. As for reducing the amount of opium they smoke, it has also been drafted, and it will be implemented as soon as it is approved by the Anti-Opium General Supervision Department.</p>
<h3>Jiao Yitang Came to Shanghai to Raise Funds for the National Medical Center</h3>
<p>Hosted a Banquet for Business and Charitable Circles the Night Before Last</p>
<p>Central Committee member Jiao Yitang has always been enthusiastic about promoting the cause of Chinese medicine. Recently, he and Central Committee members Sun Zhesheng, Yu Youren, Feng Huanzhang, Chen Lifu, and others initiated the organization of the Capital National Hospital, planning to recruit experts for concentrated research. However, the National Hospital is a pioneering project, and the equipment is planned to be perfect, so fundraising is quite difficult. In January of this year, Mr. Jiao invited giants in the medical and pharmaceutical circles in Shanghai to raise funds in various ways, raising more than 60,000 yuan, which is far from enough. It is now known that Mr. Jiao hosted a banquet at the New Asia Hotel the day before yesterday to invite Shanghai business, industry, charitable organizations to raise funds again, so that it can be completed as soon as possible. All circles in Shanghai expressed their sympathy. Wang Xiaolai, Xu Jingren, Wang Yiting, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, Wang Boqi, Wu Yunxu, Su Pei Shao, and hundreds of other guests attended. During the banquet, Mr. Jiao delivered a speech, stating that the Capital National Hospital was initiated by Central Committee members Chen Guofu, Chen Lifu, President Sun Zhesheng, President Yu Youren, Vice Chairman Feng Yuxiang, and others, with the purpose of promoting the effectiveness of Chinese medicine and improving the health of the people. In January of this year, he hosted a banquet for the Shanghai medical and pharmaceutical circles and expressed his opinions on raising funds for the National Hospital. Today, he continues to express his opinions and specially invites Shanghai business, industry, and charitable circles to guide and support him, so that it can be completed as soon as possible. Chinese medicine was left to us by our ancestors. Since the government promulgated the regulations on Chinese medicine, Chinese medicine has been protected by law. The Third Plenary Session passed the methods for medical schools. The Central National Medical Center has recently opened training classes to organize Chinese medicine and progress gradually, which can be expected day by day. However, without the establishment of the National Hospital, it cannot be perfected. Therefore, he and the members of the Beijing Central Committee initiated the National Hospital, and the Central Committee agreed to allocate 150,000 yuan for construction. However, this is for the welfare of the people, and some of the funds are planned to be raised from all walks of life in order to make the various equipment perfect. In this way, the Chinese medical community will have statistics on the treatment of diseases for practical research, and its development will be easier. Recently, there have been more than ten Chinese medicine branches in Western countries, which shows that the world is also researching Chinese medicine. Therefore, the establishment of the National Hospital in our country is even more urgent. I sincerely hope that Shanghai's business, industrial, and charitable circles will give their support. Then, Wang Xiaolai gave a speech, stating that Chinese medicine has a long history. He suffers from diseases and always takes Chinese medicine. Last year, when he was ill, he asked Chinese medicine doctor Wang Zhongqi to prescribe medicine and never took Western medicine. Now I have regained my health, which shows the miraculous effect of Chinese medicine. Therefore, I am very sympathetic to the筹设 of the Capital National Hospital and sincerely hope that everyone will support the good deeds of Committee Member Jiao, one to preserve the national essence and one to improve the health of the people. After the speech, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Hainan Island Investigation Team Scheduled to Depart</h3>
<p>Gathering in Hong Kong Before Mid-April</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to promote the development of Hainan Island, has formed a Hainan Island Industrial Investigation Team with the chambers of commerce in Hong Kong and Guangzhou, scheduled to gather in Hong Kong on April 15th to depart. The Chamber of Commerce has notified various industries to send representatives to participate. It is now known that the participants in the investigation team from this city include Xiao Zongjun from Sincere Company, Chen Xiaodie from Family Industrial Society, Huang Juechen from China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Chen Wenming from the Chinese Herbal Medicine Association, and others. Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, will also go to inspect. If representatives from various industries wish to join, they can report to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce before the end of this month for preparation. According to Yan E'sheng, secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hainan Island has abundant resources and many products. In terms of 25 years, the net value of imported foreign goods such as foreign rice, kerosene, milk, foreign paper, iron bars, and teak is only more than 4 million yuan, while the value of exported goods is more than 5.77 million yuan, with a trade surplus of more than 1 million yuan. Local sugar is particularly dominant. In the 24th year, only more than 40,000 yuan were exported, while in the 25th year, more than 77,000 packages have been exported, and there are still many to be exported. The total output is estimated to be more than 100,000 packages. The area has no violent hurricanes throughout the year, and overseas Chinese remit 20 million yuan every year, so the future is promising.</p>

Mr. Xia will leave Shanghai tomorrow (25th) and go to Nanjing via Nanjing.</p>

<h3>Mediation on Treatment Conditions of Silk Weaving Workers to Proceed Today</h3>
<p>Calling Labor and Management for Questioning at 1 PM</p>
<p>After the strike among silk weaving factory workers occurred, party and government authorities dispatched personnel to persuade them to resume work.

<h3>Strike of Child Laborers at the British Candle Factory Resolved</h3>
<p>Workers at the British Candle Factory on Robison Road in West Shanghai demanded improved treatment. After the company responded and accepted part of the demands, the child laborers went on strike again the day before because their goals were not achieved, which affected all work. Yesterday morning, after persuasion from the general representative Ma Jun and others, they returned to work at 7 AM. They had proposed three conditions: ⑴ A retirement bonus of one month for each year of service for those who have worked for three years (the company previously agreed to one month for each year for those over 45 years old). ⑵ An increase in wages of 2.5 cents per hundred boxes (wages of $5 should be given per week). ⑶ If the factory hires new child laborers, the old child laborers should be promoted to work in other departments (because the age of the child laborers in the factory is 40 or 50 years old, and the wages of child laborers are lower than those of workers in other departments). At 2 PM, the representative Ma Jun went to the factory to negotiate. He was received by the foreman Ma Jiexun. As a result of the negotiations: ⑴ The retirement bonus will be handled in accordance with the regulations of the Asia General Company. ⑵ Wages will be increased by another 5 cents per hundred boxes. ⑶ If the factory hires child laborers, old child laborers will be allowed to be promoted to work in other departments. This dispute has temporarily come to an end.</p>

<h3>Competition between British, American, and Japanese Shipping Routes Stimulates Chinese Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily reports that in this quasi-war era of the world, the world shipping industry is therefore reflecting on and striving to expand shipping routes. The activities of the two major currents of Japanese shipping, Nippon Yusen and Osaka Shosen, and the advances of Kawasaki, Mitsui, Yamashita, and Daido, are indeed a force to be reckoned with. Building new ships or extending routes is attracting worldwide attention. Therefore, in order to counter this, foreign shipping companies are building large ships. Competition between domestic and foreign ships is becoming increasingly fierce in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Shanghai, as a relay port for new shipping routes, is also a central hub for competition among these new and sharp vessels. Its international position will become even more important in the future. Therefore, the Chinese shipping industry, in view of this trend, is also receiving considerable stimulation. The eight regulations for consolidating the shipping industry stipulated by the Ministry of Communications are being actively implemented. China Merchants Bureau is pouring all its efforts into developing long-distance ocean routes and securing the Nanhua Line in order to compete with the British, American, and Japanese shipping industries.</p>

<h3>Sino-Polish Cultural Association Prepared to Hold Art Exhibition in Poland</h3>

<p>Since its establishment in 1933, the Sino-Polish Cultural Association has achieved considerable success in promoting cultural exchange between China and Poland.

<h3>Kidnapping Case in Qingpu: Kidnappers and Hostage Transferred</h3>

<h3>Another Water Thief, Yin Xiaosanzi, Arrested</h3>
<p>Stealing Items from a Westerner on a British Ship</p>
<p>The notorious water thief, Dabaozi (nicknamed Water Rat), has many accomplices who specialize in stealing clothing from various Chinese and foreign ships. Since being arrested by the Water Police and sent to court, his accomplices have become slightly less active. The day before, Yin Xiaosanzi (a 30-year-old from Zhenjiang), also of the Water Rat type, sneaked onto the British ship Corsar at the Gonghexing Wharf in Hongkou and stole a pair of glasses worth 3 pounds, 17 shillings, and 6 pence in British currency, and twelve copper coins from a Westerner's room. When he was about to leave the room with the stolen goods, he was caught by a Westerner, who twisted him around, searched him, and found the stolen goods. He was sent to the Water Police Station. After interrogation by the head constable, it was confirmed that he was also a water thief. Yesterday afternoon, Detective Gu Wenkui transferred the thief to the local court. The duty inspector conducted a preliminary trial for a week and ordered him to be detained pending prosecution.</p>
<h3>Li Lanbao Was Lured to Shanghai and Sold into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Three Women Detained Pending Sentencing</p>
<p>Li Lanbao, an 18-year-old woman from Suzhou, lived in her hometown of Tongli. She was married to Li Quansheng. In November of the lunar calendar last year, she was lured to Shanghai by Wang A'hai and Xiang Heshang, fellow villagers, and hidden at Chen Ding's and Yang Liu's residence at No. 51 Jingyuan Street. Later, she was sold to Li Zhu, a woman from Wuxi who opened a brothel at No. 37 Beihai Road, for 150 yuan to work as a prostitute. Recently, Li Lanbao's aunt, Li Lin, learned of this and rushed to Shanghai the day before yesterday to report the situation to the Laozha Police Station, which ordered Detective Lai Yusi to go to Jingyuan Street, Beihai Road, etc., and successively arrested the three women Li Zhu, Chen Ding, and Yang Liu, and took them back to the police station for detention. It was learned that Li Lanbao was hidden at No. 12, Lane 120, Caishi Road in the French Concession. The detectives went there again and rescued her. Yesterday morning, the police station sent the three women, Li Zhu, etc., to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. First, the police station lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, explained the case and prosecuted the three defendants in accordance with Article 240 of the Criminal Law. According to Li Lanbao's testimony, in November of last year, she was deceived by Wang A'hai, a fellow villager, to come to Shanghai for fun and was sold to Li Zhu to work as a prostitute. According to the detective's report, the circumstances of the arrest of each defendant were explained, and a contract of sale of Li Lanbao found in Li Zhu's home was presented for inspection. Judge Qian Hongye then interrogated Li Zhu, who confessed that Li Lanbao voluntarily sold herself to me to work as a prostitute. At that time, she said that she had no husband. Chen Ding and Yang Liu both denied participating in the sale of Li Lanbao as a prostitute. Judge Qian obtained the confession and announced that the debate in this case was over and scheduled the verdict to be announced on Thursday morning of this week.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau Expands Zero Switchboard</h3>
<p>Another Hundred Pairs of Relay Lines Added; Wusong and Other Areas Gradually Improved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications previously had a sharp increase in urban users, and a special expansion of the zero switchboard and Wusong Pudong and other areas called the receiving machine will be planned to be converted into self-persuading machines. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Sharp Increase in Users: The city's urban telephone has been actively improved by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, and the areas of South Shanghai, Zhabei, and Longhua have been converted to automatic telephone machines. In recent years, telephone services have been exceptionally convenient. The number of shops, households, institutions, and groups, etc. that have installed telephones in each district has increased from more than 2,000 to nearly 5,000. The reason for the sharp increase in users is that after the central government implemented the legal tender policy, the financial market became active, so the total number of installations more than doubled. Moreover, the bureau continues to improve transportation tools.</p>
<p>Expansion of Switchboard: The Shanghai Telephone Bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company laid a hundred pairs of north-south city relay lines for the communication relay lines between the urban area and the special zone. The special zone dials "02" and the urban area dials "0" to call the receiver. Due to the sharp increase in telephone users in the urban area, the original "0" switchboard relay line is insufficient. Therefore, the bureau has specially planned to expand it. It is currently purchasing materials and will add another hundred pairs of relay lines. It will be laid as soon as the materials are ready.</p>
<p>Improvement of Each District: The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications recognizes the improvement of the city's telephone engineering, so telephone services have been exceptionally convenient in recent years. Now the bureau, in addition to converting the central area of Nanshi, Zhabei, Longhua and other areas to automatic machines, is now planning to gradually convert the calling machine of Wusong, Pudong, and Minhang and Zhuanqiao, etc. under the county to automatic machines, so that the city's telephone equipment is completely unified.</p>
<h3>China Military Transportation Association Investigates Transportation Agencies</h3>

<h3>Investigation into the Suicide of British Girl Thompson</h3>
<p>Keeper Appears in Court to State Idle Talk; Haines Focuses on the Deceased's Honor</p>
<p>The English Shanghai Evening Post says that British girl Thompson, residing in Shanghai, was twenty-three years old. She was renowned throughout the city for her athletic skills and had won many championships, and was admired by thousands of people. On the 11th of this month, she committed suicide by drinking Lysol lotion. After unsuccessful treatment, she died. On Sunday afternoon, Coroner Haines of the British Consulate General's Police Court ruled that the lady had died from</p>
<p>Suicide, with Unclear Motives. During the hearing, Keeper, a fellow resident of the deceased and enamored with her, appeared in court to testify that two weeks before the deceased's suicide, he had discussed their marriage with her. He told her the reasons why he could not get married at the moment and decided to give up. The deceased also expressed her sympathy.</p>
<p>The Last Time he saw the deceased was at 10:30 PM on March 10. The deceased went to his room to chat, and there was no argument. However, during the conversation, he mentioned that he might as well move so that they could see each other less. The deceased refused, so he decided to stay. When the deceased left the room, her expression was as usual. Haines then declared that</p>
<p>There Was No Doubt that the deceased drank Lysol lotion at 7:30 PM on the night of March 11. It is also clear that the deceased especially loved Keeper. Perhaps she had been thinking about this that night and decided that it was not worth living in the world since she could not marry him. However, based on the witness's testimony, it is difficult to determine</p>
<p>What Kind of Thoughts she had at the Time of Death. Haines announced the adjournment of the court and then angrily stated a minute later that some of the unkind parts of society were making idle talk about the circumstances of the lady's death. However, because these malicious words were intended to harm the deceased's honor, it is now necessary to make a statement for the sake of justice, that is, that such slander has no medical evidence.</p>
<h3>Tan Bingguang Recovers His Lost Child</h3>
<p>Younger Brother Found in Xingfa Hotel; Male and Female Abductors Vanished</p>
<p>Tan Bingguang, a Cantonese, lives at No. 61, Lane 281 (Tongrenli), Wuchang Road. He has a son named Xiaodidi, who is five years old. On the afternoon of the 11th of this month, Xiaodidi suddenly disappeared. After searching everywhere, there was no news. Tan had no choice but to report the matter to the police station and request them to search for his whereabouts. However, because the clues were difficult to find, no clues were obtained. Unexpectedly, at about 11 PM the night before, the police station suddenly received an anonymous call, asking them to immediately go to the Xingfa Hotel at No. 374 North Zhejiang Road with the Huishi Police Station to escort and lead the child. At that time, the police station immediately ordered detectives to go, and there was indeed a child in Room No. 6. In addition, there was no one else. After investigation, according to the hotel clerk, the child was brought to the hotel at 10 PM on the 22nd by a man about twenty years old, claiming to be Zhang Er'a, accompanied by a woman about thirty years old. Not long after, the man and woman went out. The time from when the detectives rushed to the hotel to when the detectives arrived was only a few tens of minutes. Therefore, the detectives first searched the room and then picked up a piece of paper on the ground, which read "Tan Bingguang, No. 61, Tongrenli, Wuchang Road." The detectives determined that the Tan family did have a case of a missing child, so they immediately led the child to the Tan family's residence for confirmation. It was indeed Tan's younger brother, who had been missing for more than ten days. The family was overjoyed to be reunited. Afterwards, it was speculated that these abductors learned that the owner had reported to the police station, and it was difficult to leave the country, so they borrowed the hotel to send the original child back. The remaining police station, in view of the recent rampant abduction, did not cancel the case and continued to send detectives to search for the abductors in order to catch them and deter the abductors, and to maintain public security.</p>
<h3>Sun Shaoqing Accused of Barratry, with Three Additional Charges</h3>
<p>㊀ Shi Dezhi's 40,000 Yuan ㊁ Lu Guanzeng's Over 60,000 Yuan ㊂ Jiang Yangshi's Property Division Case, Extorted 107,000 Yuan</p>
<p>—Pan Xueyan and Others Testified in Court Yesterday—</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing was accused of barratry and extortion. Yesterday afternoon, the case was continued by Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Special First Court. The lawyer of the police department, Ru Baoyi, stated that regarding the case of Wu Dengying being defrauded, which was previously prosecuted by the police department, the bank drafts paid had been verified by the police department regarding their numbers, amounts, and bank names. A detailed list would be submitted to the court. Xu Maochang, the main person defrauded in the Xu Maochang case, and Pan Xueyan had both appeared in court. The original contract for the Yao Zhichun case had also been obtained, with Sun also signing on it. Today, the police department filed three additional charges against Sun: ㊀ In December of the 22nd year, he extorted 40,000 yuan in silver from Shi Dezhi through intimidation. The reason was that Shi had suspended a coolie, and that coolie colluded with Sun Shaoqing, Wang Zhenchuan, Fan Liangbo, Wu Yunfu, and others in the name of the Jishan Hospital to accuse Shi in the District Court, claiming that Shi Dezhi's medicated water was imitating their Shidaoshi medicated water. They used various intimidating methods against Shi Dezhi and his attorney, Xu Shihao, to obtain 40,000 yuan.</p>
<p>During the period of their intimidation, Shi's son-in-law, Roberts, reported to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, and the police station's records have been brought to the case. ㊁ In January of the 23rd year, he extorted 67,000 yuan from Lu Guanzeng through intimidation. Lu Guanzeng and his cousin Lu Zhushuang had already divided their property. Lu Zhushuang then hired Sun Shaoqing to litigate and use various threats, causing Lu Guanzeng to pay 67,000 yuan. Wang Zhenchuan and Jiang Zhaozhou were also mediators along with Sun. Today, Lu Guanzeng and his accountants Yu Shaoqiu and Pan Huan Cheng</p>
<p>have all appeared in court. ㊂ Sun Shaoqing had engaged in barratry in the case of Jiang Guopei and Jiang Yangshi dividing their property. The litigation in your court has already ended, but Sun used intimidation to make Jiang Yangshi pay 107,000 yuan. The police department filed lawsuits for the above three cases this morning. However, when Sun was arrested, documents regarding the engagement contracts of Wang Zikang, the accountant, and Ni Jiong, the lawyer, in the case of Ma Hongda in the Special Second Court were found in his home, so they will be prosecuted together next time, and Sun's wife, Sun Zhu, will also be prosecuted, etc. The court then ordered Sun to write the words</p>
<p>"Sun Shaoqing's Signature" in court and then asked if the words "Recommended by Sun Shaoqing" on the contract signed in the Yao Zhichun case were his signature, but Sun absolutely denied it. The court asked if the engagement contract of Wang Zikang, the accountant, was found in his home. He replied, "Yes," but denied that the lawsuit was something he had taken up through barratry. Judge Qian then summoned attorney Xu Shihao to court and handed him the record of the testimony taken by Judge Qian in the court office on the 3rd of this month regarding the Shi Dezhi case. After Xu read it,</p>
<p>he made some minor corrections and signed the record. Subsequently, Western Detective Ge Laobo testified that he had found that the 40,000 yuan paid by Shi Dezhi was handed to Sun Shaoqing in a garden in West Shanghai. Then Xu Maochang testified, proving that Sun Shaoqing had repeatedly come to my office to borrow money from me on behalf of Pan Xueyan. I then asked my friend Cai Futang to mediate, and the matter was settled with 19,000 yuan. Then Pan Xueyan testified that she initially knew nothing about the matter of demanding money from Xu Maochang.</p>
<p>On the day of signing, my mother told me that Mr. Xu was now willing to pay me a sum of money and instructed me to sign for it the day before yesterday. I signed to receive the money because I and Xu Pu were friends and had no relationship, so how could I accept this unclear sum of money? Therefore, I did not agree, but I went to sign under my mother's strong pressure. I went home as soon as I finished signing. I don't know anything about the content and the process, etc. Then Pan's mother, Cao Zhao, testified that it was Gu Hongsheng (i.e., Pan Hongsheng) who introduced and handled the negotiation with Xu, and the daughter didn't know anything, etc.</p>
<p>According to Lu Guanzeng, I and my uncle Lu Zhushuang had already separated our family a long time ago. Later, when my uncle was stationed in Japan as a consul, he had already exhausted his family property. When he was discharged and returned to China, he lacked travel expenses, so I borrowed money from him so that he could return to China. However, after returning to China, he borrowed 100,000 yuan from me, intending to create a Hua Central or Hua East Bank. After I found out that this was not the case, I did not lend it to him. Later, Lu Zhushuang sued me in the Shanghai District Court, saying that I had encroached on public property during the Guangxu 19th year, and also</p>
<p>listed Yu Shaoqing as a defendant. At that time, I hired attorney Cai Nipei to appear in court. Attorney Cai told me not to appear in court because I lived in Suzhou and was not under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai District Court. Unexpectedly, after the court session, the judge ordered Yu to be released on bail and ordered me to hand myself over to the court within three days. Later, the reconciliation was handled by Yu Shaoqing and Pan Huan Cheng. I don't know the details. Then Yu and Pan proved that they negotiated a settlement with Sun Shaoqing and Jiang Zhaozhou and paid 67,000 yuan. The payment was also made at Sun's home, and Wang Zhenchuan was also present when the money was paid, etc. Judge Qian then questioned Sun based on the testimonies of the various witnesses, but Sun still absolutely denied it. The court reviewed the testimonies and announced that the case would be adjourned for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Yan Ziyu Sentenced in Central Refrigeration Plant Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Using Fraudulent Means to Cause Others to Hand Over Property Yesterday, Sentenced to Six Months Imprisonment</p>
<p>Yan Ziyu and Yu Wenhao, the owners of the Central Refrigeration Plant, mortgaged all of the plant's assets, equipment, and machinery to Xu Weizhou from Wuxi for 55,000 yuan in silver in March of the 24th year of the Republic of China. However, before the term expired, it was discovered that the plant had already been sold to the Bank of China and registered for business, disregarding the mortgaged portion. Xu then hired attorneys Xu Shihao and Zuo Dedao to accuse Yan and Yu of fraud in the First Special Court. Both defendants failed to appear after being summoned during the trial.</p>
<p>An order was issued for their arrest. Later, the police arrested Yan Ziyu and escorted him to the court. He was ordered to be released on bail for 30,000 yuan. Yu Wenhao was approved to be wanted. Now, the plaintiffs Xu Shihao and Zuo, the agents of Xu Weizhou, submitted a supplementary statement detailing the facts, stating that the plaintiff and the defendants were originally strangers. They met through an introduction by a friend, Zhu Lianfu. In February and March of the previous year, the defendant Yan Ziyu claimed to the plaintiff that the Central Refrigeration Plant was solely owned by him.</p>
<p>The capital was abundant. The annual import and export trade amounted to no less than one million yuan. Recently, due to the expansion of business, funds were needed to cope with it. It was proposed to mortgage the plant's machinery, equipment, and decorations to the plaintiff for 56,000 yuan in national currency. Because the plaintiff's personal finances were limited, he was unable to set up trade rights. Yan said that Yu Wenhao was wealthy and also willing to invest and jointly accept the mortgage. The plaintiff believed it to be true, so he invited close friends Bao Jianfu and Zhu Lianfu, and Yu Wenhao, to jointly organize a syndicate. Bao contributed 32,000 yuan, Zhu contributed 5,500 yuan,</p>
<p>The plaintiff contributed 5,500 yuan, and Yu 11,000 yuan, totaling 55,000 yuan. The plaintiff, under the name of Xu Weiji, established a mortgage right with Yan Ziyu. When the contract was signed, the plaintiff and Bao and Zhu recognized that the allocated shares had been fully collected, and they also asked Yu in person, who claimed that the 11,000 yuan he recognized had been delivered to Yan Ziyu, and Yan also admitted to having received it. The plaintiff then handed over the remaining 44,000 yuan to Yan, and both parties signed a mortgage contract, each holding it as proof. In fact, Yu was the capital of the Central Refrigeration Plant and accounted for shares of</p>
<p>Seven-tenths, and the allocated share of 11,000 yuan was not paid at all. He colluded with Yan to defraud, and they were partners in crime. It was found that the plant had already entered into a sales contract with the Bank of China before the plaintiff was mortgaged. Therefore, the lawsuit was filed, and incidental civil claims were attached, etc. This case has been clarified by Judge Ye Shengchao's interrogation. Yesterday afternoon,</p>
<p>The verdict was announced: Yan Ziyu, with the intent to illegally possess property, used fraudulent means to cause others to hand over property and was sentenced to six months of imprisonment. The defendant shall jointly compensate the plaintiff for 44,000 yuan, plus interest of 600 yuan per month from June 5th of the 24th year of the Republic of China until the date of execution.</p>
<h3>Brief Report on Maritime Communications</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs received a radio message from the Taikoo Steamship Company's Chongqing Wheel on the afternoon of the 21st, stating that the ship, which had departed from Shanghai, was at 29 degrees 6 minutes north latitude and 122 degrees 25 minutes east longitude, which is near Ningbo's sea area, and found a large civilian ship drifting on the sea. There were no boatmen on the ship. It was presumed to be an accident. However, it seriously hinders the route. Upon receiving the report, Jianghai Customs notified various shipping companies the day before yesterday, telling the coastal transport ships to pay attention to avoid danger.</p>
<p>The Li Yuan Company's Changde Wheel had an accident near Sheshan. It has now been verified that it ran aground on hard sand, not a reef. However, the captain and crew did not wait for the rescue ship to arrive and all left the ship. They took the pilot boat to Shanghai. After the company and the insurance association jointly ordered all crew members and surveyor Xu Zufan to return to Xiaowei Mountain on a large tugboat to help rescue the ship. However, as of the afternoon before yesterday, Shanghai had not yet received a call from the rescue personnel. They were deeply worried. Therefore, the Ship Insurance Association hired another large tugboat, the "Kran Mengsmo Le", the night before to help with the rescue. In case the Changde Wheel was heavily loaded and had a shallow draft and there were no barges available for unloading, it was planned to discard some of the coal in the ship to reduce the hull and then tow and rescue it.</p>
<h3>Toyoda Workers Demolish Caojiadu Police Station and are Summoned for Questioning</h3>
<p>Two of the Sixteen Defendants Did Not Arrive All Denied Involvement in the Demolition</p>
<p>Sun Qiantai, the chief representative of the workers of the Toyoda Textile Factory in West Shanghai, was stabbed and injured on the morning of the 19th of last month. Subsequently, the workers themselves captured the instigator, Shi Fulin. Because they petitioned the Caojiadu Branch to handle the matter, thousands of people gathered and demolished the branch, and injured the branch chief Tan Baoshou. The Municipal Police Department sent the leader of the Guard Team, Zhang Jinshan, to arrest 16 people, including Qu Hongfa, Wang Asan, Yu Haoda, Liu Chunqi, Qin Qiaosheng, Chen Chunsheng, Chen Chunguo, Zhou Lüchang, Hu Shouhou, Jiang Asi, Gan Songlin, Wu Jinsheng, Yang Yuantian, Zhang Wenyuan, and Yang Are, and transferred them to the District Court. The defendants requested</p>
<p>to stop the detention. After being granted bail, they were prosecuted for obstructing official duties and causing injury. Yesterday morning, Judge Bai Dongling opened the court. Two defendants, Qu Hongfa and Chen Chunsheng, did not arrive. According to Tan Baoshou, 42 years old, from Guangdong, at 6 a.m. on the 20th of last month, three or four thousand workers came to the bureau to make trouble. He tried to persuade them but they did not listen. They immediately started to destroy the branch, tore up the portrait of the president, and injured me, causing me to bleed. The Guard Team of the General Bureau arrived and surrounded them, etc. Zhang Jinshan said that he was 38 years old, from Hebei. After receiving news from the Caojiadu Branch, he was ordered</p>
<p>to bring a Guard Team of 40 people. At that time, the situation was very serious. After a demonstration, he first arrested nine people and then arrested seven more. The workers then dispersed, etc. On the defendant's side, ㊀ Wu Jinsheng said that he was 20 years old, from Yancheng, and a worker at the Toyoda Textile Factory. We went to petition, there were three or four thousand people, and we completely denied taking action to destroy or damage anything. ㊁ Zhou Lüchang said that he was 22 years old, a Toyoda worker. He went to work on the 20th of last month. They told me not to go to work because the workers' chief representative Sun Qiantai was stabbed and we went to petition, but I also</p>
<p>do not admit that I damaged the branch chief. ㊂ Jiang Asi said that he was 22 years old. I did not participate. I was arrested at the Workers' Welfare Association. ㊃ Yang Are said that he was 22 years old. I was late and was arrested before I even got to the branch. ㊄ Wang Asan said that he was 29 years old. I am a worker representative. Because the chief representative Sun Qiantai was stabbed, I reported it to the branch, but they didn't care. We arrested Shi Fulin ourselves and asked them to handle the matter, but they didn't release him and opened fire, injuring four of our male and female workers. When we were escaping, we crushed some of the bureau's items, and Tan Baoshou's injury was probably also caused by the crushing. ㊅</p>
<p>Yu Haoda said that he was 21 years old and completely denied the destruction. ㊆ Yang Yuantian said that he was from Taixing. I was arrested at the Welfare Association. I knew nothing about the destruction. ㊇ Chen Chunguo said that he was 23 years old, from Gaoyou. Qu Hongfa is the chairman of the Welfare Association and Sun Qiantai is the chief representative, but he claimed that he did not know anything about the destruction. ㊈ Gan Songlin said that he was 28 years old, a local. I went to the union to get a copper plate and was arrested. I don't know anything, etc. ㊉ Hu Shouhou said that he was 23 years old, from Dongtai.</p>
<p>I went to petition to arrest the traitor Shi Fulin because he injured our Sun Qiantai, but I also did not admit the destruction. ㊉㊀ Qin Qiaosheng said that he was a Toyoda worker and completely replied that he did not know anything about everything that happened. ㊉㊁ Liu Chunqi said that the worker representatives were Wang Asan, Zhang Asan, and Qu Hongfa. I heard someone say on the road that the chief representative Sun Qiantai had bought a traitor to injure him, and I</p>
<p>went to the association to inquire about those who were arrested. ㊉㊂ Zhang Asan said that he was 21 years old. I am a worker representative, I didn't go, etc. ㊉㊃ Zhang Wenyuan said that he was 20 years old, from Yancheng. Because the director mentioned Shi Fulin and was unwilling to release him, we went to petition. I also do not admit the destruction. The court decided to adjourn the trial because the defendants were not all present. Moreover, Shi Jinchun, the translator of the Toyoda Textile Factory, had important criminal suspects, so the District Court specially sent bailiff Zhou Qiwen to secretly wait for Shi to go out the day before yesterday and immediately arrest him, hire a car in advance, immediately escort him to the court, detain him, and investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Junpu Bureau Leases Gaoqiao North Sand Fields</h3>
<p>Limited to Agricultural Use</p>
<p>The Shanghai Junpu Bureau's Gaoqiao North Sand reclamation land had previously been leased to the Customs for use. It has now been recovered from today onwards. It is now scheduled to be leased in sections, limited to agricultural use. Each section is ten acres, and the annual rent is 30 yuan in national currency. Payment is required before planting. All current planting households can register with the bureau's administrator to lease it. However, the rent is calculated from January 1st of this year and must be paid in full.</p>
<h3>Two People Poisoned from Eating Pufferfish Roe</h3>
<p>Pijiang Wu Yucheng, along with the famous Afu and Asi, and five others, rented a house at No. 8 Lianyi Lane, Jiucang Street, in the city. Yesterday morning, Afu brought back a bag of pufferfish roe from outside, cooked it, and invited Wu Yucheng and others to eat it together. Yucheng was afraid of dying and did not eat it. Only Afu and one unnamed person ate it together. They drank Liangshao wine and praised it as delicious. Unexpectedly, within half an hour of eating, they felt dizzy and their hands and feet were numb. The person who ate with him was the same. Yucheng knew he was poisoned and immediately hired two cars and sent them to Renji Hospital for treatment. After treatment, Afu died of poisoning at around 5:00 because he had eaten too much. The person who ate with him was also in critical condition. The hospital reported it to the Laozha Police Station and sent Detective Zhongyi to the Laobeidou Police Station to request that the police be sent to investigate and report to the hospital for inspection.</p>
<h3>Korean Rents Remaining House to Make Drugs and Detains Second Landlords for Investigation</h3>
<p>Qian Lishi and others arrested According to drug prohibition regulations</p>
<p>Recently, the drug ban has been strict, and the spread of drugs is particularly widespread. Most of the sellers are Korean bridges in Shanghai. They rely on the judgment right as a talisman, so they have no scruples. The locations for selling drugs are mostly on the lower floors of stoves in the Public Concession, with Edward Road and Hubei Road being the most common. The second landlords only know how to profit. Whenever they see these people renting from them, they deliberately raise the rent and know</p>
<p>the rent is short. Pay three months' rent in advance. Drug dealers make profits by operating this business, so they don't mind the high rents. After renting it, they must redecorate the stove. All the original doors and windows are blocked, and a door is opened from a hidden place for access. They also open a square hole in the wall door. People who buy drugs only need to put the price in the hole to get the heroin, morphine, and other drugs they bought. If</p>
<p>the police detective knows about it and sends a detective to investigate, the original door has been blocked, and they must destroy it to enter the room. At this time, the drug dealers in the room will calmly put the drugs into the pre-set stove or hide them in a more secret place. Even if someone is caught with both the person and the stolen goods, the offender is Korean and is not subject to our country's laws. According to the treaty, the case is handed over to the Japanese Consulate. However, these drug dealers soon</p>
<p>resume their business. Therefore, the police authorities are now taking measures from the side, and specially warned the households that rent out the remaining houses. If they still rent the remaining houses to drug dealers to sell drugs privately, once it is verified, they will be reported according to law. There are still Qian Yuxing's lead shop owner Qian Lishi from Ningbo at 55 Hubei Road and Sen Da Brick and Ash Bank owner Chen Weiming at 66 Hubei Road.</p>
<p>Huge rents were paid to the Korean Kim Tae-sik and others to be used as drug trafficking agencies. In addition to searching and obtaining heroin at those two locations, totaling more than 1,300 packs, and Kim Tae-sik was handed over to the Japanese Consulate for minor punishment, Cao Qishan, a detective from the Laozha Police Station, and Chinese head Liu Yaying, Qian Lishi, and Chen Weiming were detained in the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi</p>
<p>prosecuted based on Article 5 and Article 9 of the Drug Prohibition Regulations and stated the facts of the case, requesting strict punishment to serve as a warning and to eliminate drug harm. After Qian, the Criminal Division Chief, conducted an inquiry, he ordered Qian Lishi to be detained pending sentencing next week and sentenced Chen Weiming to three years of imprisonment as a warning. In the future, I deeply hope that the general second landlords will take this as a warning and not be blinded by greed, and fuel the drug disaster.</p>
<h3>Xing Zhigang Again Asks For Suppression of Wharf Robbers</h3>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the fifth district of Shanghai County, has repeatedly requested the suppression of wharf robbers who disrupt navigation, but his request was not granted. Yesterday, he submitted a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that the Municipal Police Department be ordered to set up fixed posts and be responsible for patrolling to quell the bandits. The area from Dongjiadu No. 18 Public Wharf in Waima Road to Xinmatou to the north, and the area from Cuifeng Wharf to Damatou, are busy areas for ship passengers. The gang knows when ships come and go, so they often hang around each alley near the wharf, waiting for passengers to carry their luggage and hire rickshaws. They then rush forward, surround the vehicles, and use the excuse of asking for travel expenses to search and rob them. The rickshaw pullers also collude with each other and take advantage of each other, treating it as a constant business. Moreover, the passengers who are robbed are in the harbor and are in a hurry to leave, so most of them are unwilling to report to the bureau, and there are no posts in that area, so the gangs gather more and more and take the opportunity to plunder without any scruples. The people in the district are more deeply victimized because they enter and exit the No. 18 Public Wharf and the South Pinghu Wharf. I have repeatedly written to the former Municipal Public Security Bureau and the Wharf Management Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau to notify the Public Security Branch in charge to strictly arrest and investigate the matter, but the gang has great powers, and the detectives treat it as a formality and fail to enforce it. The various merchants in that area also witnessed this fact and were unable to remain silent. Therefore, I am specially pleading with your lord to examine and approve it, and quickly order the Municipal Police Department to strictly order its subordinates to set up fixed posts in the busy ports for passengers entering and exiting from No. 18 Public Wharf to Damatou, and to be responsible for patrolling and strictly searching and arresting them in order to combat bandits and protect navigation. I am extremely grateful.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Bank Robbery Case Accuses Private Torture and Slander</h3>
<p>The Detective Has Been Prosecuted, but Liu Bingyuan and Others Deny It</p>
<p>The detectives of the Detective Branch, Liu Bingyuan, Miao Mingzhong, and Wu Songyou, were accused by Ruan Defu, the owner of Ruan Wanxing Hardware Store at No. 119 Xinmin Road, Zhabei, Nanjing, through attorney Chen Mao Xuan, in the District Court Prosecutor's Office of detaining Gu Naide, falsely accusing him of being related to the Jiangsu Bank robbery case on Xinzha Road, and torturing him to force him to identify Ruan and Shi Dengnian and Ma Dengnian (i.e., Ma Dexiang) as accomplices. Shi and Ma were arrested, and they also went to Ruan's place. Ruan happened to be out, and they searched for a long time but found nothing and left. The next day, Miao Mingzhong went to the store and told Ruan's mother, Kong, that it would be over if she gave 150 yuan. After entrusting Fan Bingnan and others to say that it was necessary to have 100 yuan, but they were legitimate businessmen, so they did not agree. Shi and Ma were arrested and released without being transferred to the court. After Gu Naide was sent to the court, he was found to be innocent and not prosecuted. It is obvious that they framed others, used their positions to defraud money, and requested an investigation, etc. After Prosecutor Li Fen opened the court to investigate, he released the three detectives on bail and prosecuted them for obstructing freedom and fraud. Yesterday, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court to hear the case. The defendants Liu Bingyuan, Miao Yizhong, and Wu Songshan, etc., stated that there was absolutely no extortion. The officer asked Liu if there was no solicitation, why were Shi Dengnian and Ma Dengnian released after they were arrested? He replied, this was because no suspicion was found, so they were released. The officer then summoned the three plaintiffs to the court, and they all testified that there was fraud and that three families were searched for no reason. Even Gu Naide was framed, and the charges had been dropped by your court. All their attempts to defraud can be proved by Fan Bingnan. Therefore, the officer summoned Fan Bingnan to the court to prove that the defendants instructed him to negotiate gold and silver with Ruan, etc. The court decided to adjourn the trial for further questioning. Because the defendants' circumstances were serious, the original bail was insufficient, so it was decided to add a store bail of 3,000 yuan. Because it was difficult to find a guarantor at the time, the defendants' defense lawyers requested that they be ordered to pay first and then find a guarantor. The officer ordered that one defendant be taken away by the lawyer and that the bail must be corrected within three days, otherwise it would be inconvenient.</p>
<h3>Appeal in Yan Pinzheng's Abortion Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Sentencing Scheduled for the 27th</p>
<p>Yan Pinzheng, a female doctor at the Dasheng Obstetrics Hospital, and Gu Shaoqin, an intern, performed an abortion on Li Jingzhen, a local young woman, at No. 93 Yongyu Lane, Beller Road, on February 4 of this year, introduced by Xue Kebin. Due to surgical errors, the uterus was injured, and excessive bleeding occurred, resulting in Li's death the next morning. Her family reported it to the French police, and the three people, Yan, Gu, and Xue, were detained by the Second Special Court, and the police lawyer filed a public prosecution according to law. The victim's family also hired a lawyer to file an incidental complaint, seeking compensation for losses of more than 10,000 yuan in gold and a diamond ring. As a result of the trial, Yan Pinzheng was sentenced to three years and two months in prison and fined 100 yuan. Gu Shaoqin was sentenced to 10 months in prison, and Xue Kebin was sentenced to one year and eight months in prison. Because the three people, Yan, etc., did not accept the judgment, they hired lawyers such as Wang Shizong, Ge Zhiqin, and Sun Zushen to appeal to the High Third Branch. After one court hearing, they were ordered to wait for the summoning of witnesses for a retrial, which has been recorded in this newspaper. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the High Third Branch Court, headed by Wu Tingqi, along with the two judges Wang and Fan, and Prosecutor Dong, opened the court for continued questioning. The police lawyer Gu Shouxi appeared in court. The appellants denied performing an abortion on the deceased, claiming that she had an abortion elsewhere and came to retrieve the placenta. Gu Shaoqin denied helping with the abortion, and Xue Kebin, who introduced the deceased, only admitted to introducing the deceased to retrieve the placenta at Dasheng Hospital and denied introducing her for an abortion. According to witness Hu Chen, the second landlord of the small house where the deceased lived, Xue Kebin came to introduce the deceased for an abortion and accompanied her to Dasheng Hospital. She saw the two defendants wearing white clothes and performing the abortion on the deceased. According to witness Xia Chen, Hu Chen's sister, she visited the deceased at Dasheng Hospital that night. The court believed that the case was clear and ordered the opening of the debate, then declared the conclusion. The sentencing was scheduled for the 27th, and the appellants were still detained pending instructions.</p>

<h3>Modern Politics and China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Third, more experience. The cabinet of party politics is: you are responsible for a few days, and then I am responsible for a few days. Such mutual growth and infighting will increase experience, but the real political experience will suffer great damage. For example, the French cabinet lasts no more than ten months at most, and usually collapses in only two or three months. It is of course impossible to expect it to be planned and experienced in this way.</p>
<p>Fourth, technical refinement. Political technology is the same as other technologies. If you are responsible for one day today and collapse tomorrow, you will naturally not get excellent technology. Everyone knows that it is faster to drive a light car on a familiar road. Familiarity breeds skill is also a established theory. Therefore, to require technical refinement, you must be responsible for more time, not ascend the stage today and step down tomorrow.</p>
<p>Fifth, speed up the time. Multi-party politics is mutual restraint, mutual meetings, mutual discussions, wasting time, and stopping things that should be done. In this way, all undertakings of the country will suffer great harm, especially military affairs will suffer great failures. This situation has been seen in various countries, so in order to improve efficiency, they have shifted from emphasizing the rule of law to emphasizing the rule of people.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about removing the drawbacks of restraint. All comrades understand that politics relies on the promotion of power, and of course they also know that multi-party politics is the dispersion of power. This group and that group do not conspire with each other. Is this the dispersion of power? Is it applicable in this world of struggle?</p>
<p>Secondly, the neutralization of power. Under the politics of separation of powers, you do that way, I do this way, power is wasted, and politics does not move forward, and power restraint occurs, because when you use your power, I still want to hinder you, and when I use my power, you come to hinder me again. Isn't party politics the dispersion of power, the neutralization of power, and the restraint of power? At any time and any place, there is infighting, trying to eliminate other people's power and increase their own power. As a result, a few people compete for status, but the future of the country and the nation is buried. Various countries have seen this problem, so they want to correct it, which is why today's trends have emerged, resulting in today's political form and substance.</p>
<p>These five points are the important reasons for today's political evolution. Understanding these five points, we can know that the evolution of politics is an inevitability of the urgent preparation and emergency measures required by the intensity of the struggle. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Cao Shuming's Speech on the National Defense of the Soviet Union (Continued)</h3>
<p>㊀ All Soviet military supplies, such as guns, cannons, bullets, tanks, bombers, destroyers, submarines, torpedo boats, etc., are self-made and self-sufficient, and none of them are foreign goods. During the first five-year plan, this supply only paid considerable attention and achieved results in terms of quantity. Now, it has further strived for excellence in terms of quality and has achieved great success.</p>
<p>㊁ Because military equipment, as large as guns, cannons, tanks, and warplanes, and as small as explosives and screws, all have their importance and secrecy. If these things are all bought from foreign countries, you may not be able to buy the most refined and the newest. At the same time, the selling country or several countries can know your national defense strength and know your national defense secrets. To put it mildly, you cannot defend the country that sells you military supplies. The Soviet authorities know the importance of this point, so they manufacture and supply themselves, on the one hand, to maintain the secrecy of military strength, and on the other hand, not to be restrained by any foreign country. At the same time, because of the development of heavy industry, a large number of specialized technical talents have been cultivated in practice, and most of the labor problems have been solved. This point has more real significance in national defense. Please pay special attention to it.</p>
<p>㊂ The Soviet authorities know the close relationship between transportation and military affairs. For transportation, they add railways or highways where railways have not been built, or add double tracks or parallel highways where railways have already been built. They are also extending existing canals or building new canals to connect water transportation. As for the extension and development of civil aviation routes, they are making every effort to develop them. The Soviet Union's construction of transportation is simply progressing by leaps and bounds. You must know that from a military point of view, the development of transportation is convenient for mobilization and transportation, which is of great significance in national defense. In short, the Soviet Union's military defenses have considerable strength as of now, and they are continuing to move forward. On the one hand, the Soviet authorities are shouting the slogan of defending peace with peace and force on the international stage, because peace is not an empty promise, but must be prepared with strength. Only with sufficient strength can we talk about peace with strength, and only then can peace be realized. This is precisely the subtle effect of the Soviet Union's simultaneous efforts to strengthen its military and sing loudly for peace. Second, politics. The politics of the Soviet Union has great significance in national defense. We all know that the Soviet Union is founded on communism. Now, in the Soviet Union, in politics, only the Communist Party under the leadership of Lenin and Stalin controls the political power. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Jiaotong Sports Federation Holds a Members' Representative Congress</h3>
<p>Wu Shaoshu from the Ministry of Transportation Attends the Meeting to Guide</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sports Federation of Various Agencies of the Ministry of Transportation recently held a general meeting of members' representatives at the YMCA. More than 20 representatives from the Ministry of Transportation Minister Yu, Director Wu Shaoshu, and various agencies attended. Kang Yong was elected as the chairman of the conference, and the ceremony was held. The chairman reported on the establishment of the association and explained the mission of the association. Then, Xu Duo, the representative of the board of directors, and Gu Youwu, the representative of the board of supervisors, reported on the work situation in the past year. Then, Representative Wu delivered a speech, briefly saying that our country has valued literature and belittled martial arts for thousands of years, creating a state of anti-sports movement in politics, economy, and society, resulting in the decline of the national physique to this day, which is far inferior to other countries. In recent years, society has responded to the country's declining fortunes, and the government's efforts to promote sports have gradually attracted people's attention. However, the development of sports is still far behind other countries. Therefore, the organization of the Shanghai Sports Federation of Various Agencies has not only the mission of promoting the development of sports, but also the responsibility of contributing to the country and society. Then, the articles of association were revised and proposals were discussed, all of which were passed and handed over to the next board of directors for handling.

<h3>Tonight's Order for the Chinese Youth Basketball Game</h3>
<h3>The Social Affairs Bureau Orders All Middle Schools in the City to Submit Six Key Points of Student Status</h3>
<p>▲ A Circular is Issued to Strictly Enforce It to Rectify</p>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau yesterday issued an order to all municipal and private middle schools in the city, saying that the measures for middle schools in the city to report student status were issued by the former Municipal Education Bureau in the instruction No. 6231 of the Education Department in March of the thirty-second year, and have been followed since then for a long time. Recently, it has been found that a small number of schools have not strictly followed the regulations. The following points that should be paid attention to are listed below: ㊀ Each semester, the enrollment of new students and transfer students should be reported together with the certificates and completed forms for the record within one month after the start of the semester. No delays are allowed. If the deadline is exceeded, the review will not be conducted. ㊁ If the admission certificates of new students and transfer students in each term are allowed to be submitted later, or should be inquired from the original school's competent authority, they should be recovered and submitted, or sent for inquiry within the semester, and handled separately. Do not neglect and delay. After the deadline, those who have not completed the procedures for confirming student status will not be recognized for their transfer or promotion qualifications, or will not be allowed to participate in graduation exams and joint exams. ㊂ Transfer students from other schools must have certificates that are connected to the semester before they can be admitted. Once it is found that they are skipping grades, their student status will not be recognized. ㊃ When recruiting students with equivalent academic ability, they should be carefully screened during the entrance examination, and those with truly equivalent academic ability should be selected and admitted according to the ratio stipulated in the regulations, and the examination papers should be submitted for review. ㊄ All students transferred from unregistered schools, regardless of their past grades, are only allowed to be admitted to the first grade with equivalent academic ability. ㊅ The school should first review the admission certificates of students, and separately order the submission of formal graduation certificates or transfer certificates for verification. Do not use informal proof documents to perfunctorily deal with the matter. The foregoing items are extremely important to the progress of teaching, academic studies, and academic advancement. Since the issuance of this circular, it shall be strictly enforced to rectify the situation. This order is hereby issued to all schools to strictly follow the procedures.</p>
<h3>The City Public Education Center Held an Opening Ceremony for the United National Salvation Movement Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than Three Thousand Citizens Participated in an Unprecedented Grand Occasion; Director Pan Unveiled the Ceremony, and Dr. Liu Zhanen Delivered a Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Education Center's United National Salvation Propaganda Movement opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. The surrounding environment was freshly decorated, and the citizens who participated were extremely enthusiastic, numbering more than three thousand. After the chairman, Curator Xu Zexiang, led the ceremony, Director Pan of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs unveiled the ceremony. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Director Unveils the Ceremony - The bell rang ten times, and Director Pan unveiled the ceremony and delivered a speech. He stated that to complete the genuine United National Salvation work, the entire nation must be of one mind, united and as solid as an iron bucket. Only then can we talk about resisting the enemy, defending against insults, saving the country, and striving for survival. Last year's Liangguang Incident and the Xi'an Incident were both peacefully resolved without firing a single shot under the authority and virtue of the Central Government. All this symbolizes that our country already has a supreme leader and our government already has a solid foundation. Finally, he hoped that the people of the whole country would unanimously support the government and strive for United National Salvation under the leadership of our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, to complete the mission of national rejuvenation.</p>
<p>Liu Zhanen's Speech - Next, Dr. Liu Zhanen delivered a speech. His first point was that to achieve true national unity, it is necessary to have not only political unity, military command unity, and financial unity, but also, and more importantly, spiritual unity. How to implement spiritual unity? The prerequisite is to start with civic training, and he proposed five specific goals for civic training. His second point was to hope that the people of the whole country would unite as one, emulate countries like Russia, Germany, and Italy, and organize the entire population, regardless of scholars, farmers, workers, or merchants, regardless of men, women, old, or young, into a national mobilization. Start with public training in every family, and then extend the strength of 450 million people to strive to save the country.</p>
<p>A Message to the Citizens - Elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow citizens of the city, the call for United National Salvation has arrived with the 26th year of the Republic. Look, who among the vast majority of citizens of the Republic of China, except for the "remnants of feudal warlords," the "communist bandits," and the so-called "people's front" or "united front," except for the "traitors" who act as puppets for the enemy, such as Pu Yi and Yin Rugeng, do not express joyful and encouraging support for the slogan of United National Salvation? Yes, United National Salvation is what everyone eagerly hopes for, it is what China urgently needs, it is what everyone has in mind. However, we must not treat this as an empty slogan, just shouting it out. We must permanently imprint it in our hearts, we must earnestly believe in it and practice it, we must bravely and resolutely promote its realization. We must also believe that this is a movement to which the life of our nation is entrusted. We must know that only through unity can we save the country, and only by earnestly uniting to save the country can our nation survive safely. In order to ensure that everyone never forgets and earnestly practices this, our center is holding this United National Salvation Movement propaganda week. As for why we need to unite to save the country and how to achieve United National Salvation, I would like to briefly offer my views to the fellow citizens of the city. ㊀ Why Unite to Save the Country? The facts of the current historical stage tell us that the crisis of 1936 was barely overcome. 1927 was not a peaceful year. I am afraid no one can deny this fact. All the imperialists are sharpening their swords and expanding their armies, preparing for the second large-scale massacre of weak nations. In particular, our powerful neighbor is constantly attacking us with both overt and covert schemes. In this environment, we must know that only by resisting insults and defending against enemies and by diligently preparing to cope with the current Second World War can we preserve the survival of our nation and the lives of our people. This is undoubtedly and is the only mission of every citizen of the Chinese nation at present. To resist the enemy and defend against insults, to cope with the arrival of extraordinary times, the prerequisite is to first achieve the true unity of national military command and government orders. Only then can the government further plan for the construction of the national economy and the completion of transportation. With the unity of military command and government orders, and the completion of economic and transportation construction, then, with sufficient national strength, we can talk about resisting insults and defending against enemies, saving the country, and striving for survival. Therefore, our only way to save the country at present is the "Unity Movement." ㊁ How to Achieve United National Salvation? Without unity, we cannot "save the country." If we want to "save the country," we must first "unite." This is the fact before our eyes. However, how to achieve United National Salvation? We now offer three points, hoping that all citizens of the city will practice them together under this common goal to complete the great cause of United National Salvation and embark on the path of national rejuvenation. First, Firmly Believe: The Three Principles of the People proclaimed by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Chinese Kuomintang, are not only the only doctrine to save China but also the doctrine to save the world. Therefore, we should all recognize the Three Principles of the People, jointly believe in the Three Principles of the People, and realize a new China based on the Three Principles of the People as the only object of our efforts to unite to save the country. We must use the Three Principles of the People to exclude other doctrines, and we must use the Three Principles of the People to explain all phenomena. Only in this way can we have the same common belief. Only with the same common belief can our thoughts be unified, and only then can we work together under the same goal to complete the great cause of saving the country. What are the people's front and the united front? Those are all the communist bandits' deceiving ghost stories that are at their wits' end, inciting the people to undermine unity and leading the country and the nation to destruction. Second, Support the Leader: Chinese and foreign history both tell us that the prosperity of a nation is invariably based on the masses obeying the national leader, and only with consistent action can they establish great achievements. This was the case in ancient times, and it is the same now. Look, Germany has Hitler, and Italy has Mussolini. The people unanimously support them, so they can dominate Europe. After the last Xi'an Incident, we saw the psychology of the whole country, from the government to the people, unanimously supporting the leader, which proves that our country now has a supreme leader and that the life of the country and the nation is entrusted to him. From now on, we should sincerely support this supreme leader—Chairman Chiang Kai-shek—and dedicate all our strength to the country so that our supreme leader can use the strength of the people of the whole country to complete the great cause of resisting insults and defending against enemies and rejuvenating the nation. Third, Improve Our Lives: We know that the people's lifestyles play an important role in the rejuvenation of a nation. If you look at a strong country, its national life is bound to be full of vigor. Looking back at the people of our country, in the past, most of them were listless, either poor and ignorant or romantic and extravagant. With such a national spirit, how can we shoulder the great cause of saving the country? Therefore, in order to be able to shoulder the responsibility of resisting insults and defending against enemies and rejuvenating the nation, the improvement of our lives is an urgent task. The key to improving our lives is that the whole country, from top to bottom, should consistently implement the New Life Movement and strive for economic construction so that we have a full spirit in our minds and abundant supplies in materials. This improvement in spiritual and material life is the practical way to strengthen national power. Under the leadership of a supreme leader, we can shoulder the mission of saving the country and striving for survival and national rejuvenation. Finally, our center would like to hope with all sincerity that the fellow citizens of the city will recognize the current state of the country, stand united under the banner of United National Salvation, and actively strive for the United National Salvation Movement, acting as the vanguard of the nation. We also believe with all sincerity that as long as the Unity Movement is completed, the work of saving the country will surely be completed.</p>

<h3>Lack of Supply of Gold</h3>
<p>—But the Market Only Recovered by a Dime—</p>

<h3>Securities Many Long Positions in Public Bonds Emerged on the Last Day of This Month</h3>
<p>Class D Fell the Most, by 1 Yuan and 1 Dime</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was the last day of futures trading for this month, and the market was already depressed. Many long positions had already emerged. Although there were still a few rallies, the morale was already scattered. Due to the outflow of spot goods of No. 43, they were sold in each round. The long positions were severely hit. Many long positions in No. 4 were cut. No. 5, No. 10, and No. 45 were all sold. In the morning, the market opened, and the long positions immediately emerged. The market price fell back by 3, 5 dimes to 1 yuan or more. However, those who went long bought again, and because this month was the last day, the previous Class E and Class D were slightly smaller by 4, 5 dimes, but the latter were still pulled up by half a yuan to 1 yuan or more. However, most of the sellers had real goods, so the market could not be maintained. In the afternoon, the market was quite mixed, with highs and lows ranging from 1 dime to 6 dimes. Large holders sold off, and the market clearly declined, with all prices falling back by 2 dimes to 6 and a half dimes. As a result, the market price fell by 5 cents to 1 dime to 1 yuan and 1 dime. Today, only the April futures for one month were traded. The total transaction volume was 20,265,000 yuan. The results of the price changes are listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Sales Declining, Standard Yarn Rising and Falling Immediately</h3>
<p>Many Long Positions Emerged at High Prices - 24,000 Bales Delivered This Month</p>
<p>The yarn market has rebounded and the trend is calm. The current yarn sales market is smaller than before. The Tianjin gang has been buying heavily for days, and their appetite seems to be full. It is expected that they will stop temporarily. At the same time, many long positions have suddenly emerged in the near term, causing the chips to loosen, and the market has turned downward. However, the overseas cotton industry is still rising. Today is the last day for this month's yarn, and the delivery volume is expected to be between 22,000 bales and 24,000 bales.</p>
<p>This Month's Rolling Price Fell by 1 Yuan and 5 Dimes - The Spot Yarn Market Opened in the Morning, and Each Month Continued to Rise - Because US Cotton Did Rise as Expected. However, When the Second Round Opened, a Falling Trend Suddenly Started. The Three-Quality Yarn Was Flat, and Many Long Positions Emerged at the Time of Rising Prices. Therefore, The Trading Floor Was Loose and Disorderly, The Market Sentiment Became More Frustrated, and The Prices Dropped Round by Round. However, The Current Yarn Transactions Were Still Maintainable. As a Result, The Price of Each Month's Standard Yarn Fell by Six, Seven, Eight Dimes to One Yuan and Four Dimes Compared to the Previous Day's Closing Price. In the Afternoon, When The Market Opened, The Market Situation Was Still Hesitant and Weak, Because Long Positions Were Unloading In The Near Term. Current Yarn Transactions Were Not As Strong As The Previous Day. The Morale Became More And More Weary. There Was No Significant Entrance Or Exit In The Fourth Round. As A Result, The Price Of Each Month Rose Or Fell By One Dime Compared To The Morning Closing Price. It Was Found That 1,800 Bales Of Heshung Were Sold, 2,500 Bales Of Hengyi, 1,100 Bales Of Jinchang, 3,500 Bales Of Gengfeng, 850 Bales Of Fengtai, 850 Bales Of Dachangcheng, 6,200 Bales Of Changfeng, 2,650 Bales Of Runkang, 900 Bales Of Hengchang, 800 Bales Of Shengyuan, And 2,050 Bales Of Dachang. 1,100 Bales Of Yichang Were Bought, 2,500 Bales Of Wang Taixing, 900 Bales Of Dafeng, 1,200 Bales Of Daji, 4,550 Bales Of Mingde, 1,250 Bales Of Ruida, 1,150 Bales Of Shenda, 1,300 Bales Of Renfeng, 2,150 Bales Of Xiesheng, 1,100 Bales Of Fukang, 1,900 Bales Of Yongda, 2,800 Bales Of Xincheng, And 900 Bales Of Shenji.

<h3>Raw Cotton Futures Overwhelmed by Coarse Cotton</h3>
<p>—Following the Decline in the Yarn Market—</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned sluggish because the current month's trading period has only today left. There is a lack of demand for coarse cotton raw materials, but the trading of fine cotton remains decent. Therefore, exchange commodities are less welcomed, and the pressure is still heavy. Some say that the price increase of US cotton spot goods yesterday was too weak, and there may be a decline today.</p>
<p>Yesterday, it had already fallen by thirty or forty points. In the opening of the cotton market this morning, the current month slightly rose by five points. However, when auctioned to the forward period, it turned to decline, and the situation was very weak. Although US cotton rose, its upward momentum was not strong. In addition, the Japan-India trade agreement has been finalized, and Indian cotton itself has prospects for prosperity. Moreover, Chinese cotton exports have suffered a major blow. Therefore, a certain merchant heavily shorted the market yesterday afternoon. For a while, most of those who echoed this sentiment were pessimistic. Moreover, the delivery volume for this month is excessive, so the market price turned to decline. As a result, prices for all months were down by two and a half to three corners compared to yesterday's closing price. When the market opened in the afternoon, the situation was calm, and there was no significant trading activity in the market. The fluctuations were also slight, and it presented a stalemate. As a result, prices for all months were down by another five points to one corner compared to the morning's closing price. It is found that 21,600 bales were sold by Hengyi, 2,600 bales by Tongfu, 1,700 bales by Jifeng, 3,400 bales by Yuda, 3,200 bales by Dafeng, 2,600 bales by Daji, 7,300 bales by Mingde, 2,900 bales by Hexing, 7,900 bales by Gengfeng, 7,100 bales by Dachang, 5,100 bales by Shengyuan, 13,700 bales by Changhe, 5,000 bales by Changfenghu, and 3,000 bales by Jinghua. 2,800 bales were purchased by Yikang, 3,600 bales by Juxing, 2,100 bales by Yuanda, 2,600 bales by Zhenda, 6,400 bales by Fengtai, 2,800 bales by Wangtaixing, 10,300 bales by Maichang, 9,400 bales by Yichang, 4,800 bales by Changfeng, 5,100 bales by Xiecheng, 3,200 bales by Yuanxingchang, 1,200 bales by Xinchang, 1,900 bales by Yongda, 1,900 bales by Xincheng, 2,008 bales by Runkang, and 1,900 bales by Shenji. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Fine Cotton Sales Still Smooth. Current cotton consumption is still good, and the sales of fine cotton are still smooth, it is said.</p>
<h3>Japan-India Trade Agreement Successful, World Cotton Market Rises Universally</h3>
<p>The US cotton market opened yesterday with strong upward momentum. Prices for all months rose by 21 to 29 points. In the early morning, there was strong foreign telegraphic communication. Foreign merchants, especially those in Liverpool, and Wall Street traders actively purchased, and the market situation was very strong. Then, a small number of short sales, the sluggishness of the grain and stock markets, and profit-taking by bulls led to a pullback. The large-scale profit-taking of bulls last week was enough to enhance the actual position, and the actions of foreign markets were also enough to restore buyers' confidence. At the same time, the rumors of inflation and the brisk consumption swept away the concerns about the increase in cotton fields. The closing was flat and tired. The spot price rose by 11 points, and the futures price rose by 11 to 24 points. British cotton spot prices rose by 16 points, and futures prices rose by 19 to 21 points. Indian cotton was initially firm due to short covering, but then pulled back due to the sluggish stock market. Finally, it rose again due to the success of the Japan-India trade agreement and good telegraphic communication from Liverpool. The price of Pinggor rose by 6.75 to 7.5 rupees, the price of Omra rose by 7.25 to 8 rupees, and the price of White Row Creek rose by 7.25 to 7.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 22nd).</p>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 23rd was: White Row Creek at 347 rupees, down 1 rupee; Omra at 235.75 rupees, down 1.75 rupees; Pinggor at 198.25 rupees, down 1.25 rupees.</p>
<p>According to another Bombay telegram on the same day, 246 tons of cotton were exported from Rangoon last week, all of which were shipped to Liverpool.</p>
<h3>Three Brands of Yarn and Cotton Fall Back, Only Spot Yarn Rises</h3>
<p>Osaka telegram dated the 23rd: spot yarn rose by 5 to 10 yuan, 16-count fan-shaped yarn at 250 yuan, up 5 yuan; 20-count goldfish yarn at 272 yuan, up 7 yuan; 40-count five-metal yarn at 410 yuan, up 10 yuan; 42-count pheasant yarn at 395 yuan, up 5 yuan.

Cotton futures fell by 0.10 to 0.60 yuan, with the near month at 79.90 yuan and the distant month at 82.05 yuan.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea Russians Like to Drink Ho Tea</h3>
<p>What is to become of Chinese tea!</p>
<p>Russia purchases a large amount of tea from Ceylon. For half a year, no less than seven or eight thousand boxes have been transshipped through Shanghai. More than 2,060 boxes of tea were imported on the Zinijinaka round the other day. It is said that Russian ships will be waiting to transship to Vladivostok within days.</p>
<h3>Overseas Silk Prices Rise, Local Factories Wait and See</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk markets in Japan and the United States were both strong. Prices for both near and distant goods rose again. Yokohama spot prices rose by 10 yuan, and futures prices rose by 4 yuan. New York near-term prices rose by 4.5 cents compared to last Saturday, and futures prices rose by 2.5 cents. Japanese silk at 83 degrees rose by 2 cents, and silk at 75 degrees rose by 1 cent. The prices of other Chinese silks and Lyons silks remained unchanged. The Shanghai silk market currently has little trading because the mentality of the manufacturers is high and the fluctuations in overseas silk prices are erratic. Yesterday, Mitsui only sold some new silk. The price of white silk from this factory returned to 78 points, 770 yuan, which was not much different from the previous market. There were also only a few transactions in Indian silk, and the prices were as before.</p>
<h3>Grains Spot Wheat Arrivals Uninterrupted, Near-Term Bulls Will Abandon Delivery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw a unanimous price increase in overseas markets, and speculators gathered, so the market was booming when it opened in the morning, with near and far months all rising by four or five points. Afterwards, the weather turned sunny, the flour market gradually loosened, and the supply of spot goods was quite connected. The mentality of taking delivery in the near term gradually weakened, so the March and April contracts fell back by four or five points. However, the outlook for new wheat is still unclear. Speculators are hesitant, not as resolute as in the near term, so there were ups and downs in the afternoon, and the momentum turned calm. Compared with the previous day, this month was up by one point, April was unchanged, and June, July, and August were up by seven points to two points respectively. Spot wheat arrivals are continuous, and the market is flat. Only Shen Da took about 2,000 bags. Zhang Bailing wheat opened at 6.23 yuan, and Guantian Tiantai wheat opened at 6.20 yuan to 6.19 yuan. Other factories lack speculative interest, it is said.</p>
<h3>Delivery Power Sufficient, Near-Term Flour Falls, New Flour Rises</h3>
<p>When the flour market opened yesterday morning, foreign wheat quotations were reported, with Chicago up by 0.37 to 0.57 yuan, Canada up by 0.40 to 0.50 yuan, and Liverpool up by 3 pence 625. Also, the weather was overcast and rainy, and people generally attributed this to the development of wheat fields, so the long positions in the forward months were quite excited, with July and August jumping up by two or three cents. However, the end of this month is approaching, the power of delivery is sufficient, and the outside bulls have to give up, so the opening fell by a fraction. However, the near-term and far-term mentalities were opposite, and the ups and downs restrained each other, so the rise and fall were not yet fierce. As the weather turned sunny in the afternoon, and the outgoing of this month continued unabated, especially the April contract was too far away from this month, which caused insider speculation, leading to a strong decline in April. The far-term also weakened, and the whole day's result was that this month fell by 0.0275 yuan, April fell by 0.0125 yuan, and July and August rose by about 0.01 yuan. Compared with the previous day, the situation was that the near term was weak and the far term was strong, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Situation is Flat for Local and Visiting Merchants</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The supply of rice from various gangs yesterday was slightly less than before, with a total of nearly 50 numbers arriving, totaling 11,100 to 11,200 piculs. Among them, more than 20 numbers were thin rice. The market situation was sluggish. Yesterday, the rain made people's mentality firm, but although the sales in Ben Street were slightly moving, they were still not smooth, and the appetite for thin rice was very light. As for speculative appetite, it was weaker than before. The North and South Ocean gangs handled nearly 2,000 bags in total, so although the thin rice market had no ups and downs, the situation was very mediocre. Kujing rice slightly returned a few points because the price had already fallen through. Early rice was only flat, and Duyangjian and Yinwu were also unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday morning, the weather was suddenly overcast and rainy. There were 15 or 16 numbers of sources from He Xia, and the number of buyers and sellers on the market was sparse, resulting in flat trading of various goods. The price situation was not much up and down compared with the previous market. However, Yinbianwu goods were scarce and sales were active, and the price situation was firm. The price situation of other goods was unchanged.</p>
<p>(Visiting Merchants' Rice) Arrivals were many and sales were small, and the market was even weaker. It seemed that the Guangdong gang had no hope of continuing to speculate. The Shantou and Xiamen and Northwest gangs had been lacking in smooth sales for a long time. The total turnover of the market was less than 3,000 bags. Apart from a small amount of Jiyuan rice handled by the Beiyang gang, it was all for the sake of local entertainment. Ben Street lacked the intention to enter because the inventory in He Xia was sufficient. Therefore, the market situation almost had a slump. The total sales of Jiangxi machine brown rice were more than 2,400 bags, and the price was slightly lower than the previous market, it is said.</p>
<h3>Standard Oil, Near Month Down, Far Month Up</h3>
<p>—Near-Term Cake Recovers by 0.0025 Yuan—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the standard oil and bean cake market lacked significant fluctuations. The fluctuations in the Dalian telegram were also slight. Both buyers and sellers lacked competition. In the near term for standard oil, there were bulls taking profits, and in the distant month, there was still speculation and absorption, so the closing price for this month fell by 0.25 yuan, and the distant month rose by 0.1 yuan and 0.05 yuan instead. The current soy market was weak, but the merchants also lacked dumping, so the market recovered by 0.01 and 0.02 yuan. The import and export of standard cake were balanced, and there was little attention to speculation and dumping. However, the spot goods moved slightly, and the near term recovered by 0.0025 yuan, and the distant term fell by 0.0025 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Quanzhou Sliced Green Opening Price Stable</h3>
<p>The sugar market was calm yesterday. The association allocated the market, and there were no changes in the number of 24 coarse sand white spot goods and transshipment goods 489, Dongbai, etc. There were also no ups and downs in the local factory's cotton white Zhenji, Dahua, and Jinxin, etc. Although the price of domestic Chaoqing production was sluggish, only one-tenth or two-tenths of those directly entrusted by the trade to the Chao gang could be purchased. The rest could not be purchased in full because most of the cargo owners were still waiting and seeing and were unwilling to sell cheaply. A few dozen bags of Quanzhou sliced green continued to arrive on the Huaping round the other day, and samples were seen yesterday. The opening price was immediately quoted at 11.80 to 11.60 yuan, which was absolutely unchanged from before. At a time when Chaoqing and Chih were falling frequently, sliced green was able to stabilize, which was really due to the scarcity of goods and active sales. Xinghua Gaojing was also 14.40 yuan, and dozens of bags were traded.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Hankou Fungus Rises Again by More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>Hankou high-grade fungus has continued to rise since it rose to 120 yuan in the previous market. According to Hankou News, it has now reached 111.60 yuan, rising by more than one yuan. The trade price here for small airmail packages of fungus is 140 yuan, and the price for high-grade fungus is 170 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Fine Twill is Uniquely Popular Due to Shortage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market turned flat due to the decline in raw cotton futures. The Japanese trading houses also offered very few. The sales of fine cloth remained stable. Only fine twill rose by another 0.05 yuan (per piece) due to the shortage of spot goods. Local traders traded a total of about six or seven hundred packages of fine cloth and fine twill. The Yantai gang in North Road also collected more than 100 packages of Qingdao fine cloth of Shuanglongzhu, Huaniao, Longmen, and Yanxi brands. Since the Sichuan gang started trading, in addition to a small amount of billige and blue cloth, they also bought 1,500 pieces of Taohuawu brand lower-grade plain silk, priced at 0.29 yuan per yard. This is the first time that the Sichuan gang has purchased colored goods since the opening of the market, and it may be able to gradually encourage them in the future, which makes the traders feel excited and the market situation is very stable.</p>

<h3>Model Domestic Product Family Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The Shanghai Domestic Products Movement United Association recently plans to hold a model domestic product family exhibition. This event has a great effect on the promotion of domestic products. We believe that it is worth holding, but there are several aspects that we can contribute to in the implementation.</p>
<p>First, the four words "model domestic product" mean that there will be first-class domestic products. Therefore, the selection of goods must be strict and must be genuine, and it is better to have fewer products than to have substandard ones. In particular, we must pay close attention to the quality standards of domestic products. If it is below the fifth grade, calling it a model domestic product will always feel inappropriate.</p>
<p>Second, model domestic products should be categorized into food, clothing, daily necessities, stationery, cosmetics, travel products, and even building materials. The scope of collection should be based on the standards of low price, good quality, and purely domestic production.</p>
<p>Third, a model domestic product family does not have to be magnificent and luxurious, and there is no need to compete in extravagance. We can set out several methods according to the amount of income and the abundance of living power of each family. For example, how to arrange a family with a salary of 200 yuan, how to arrange a family with a salary of 100 yuan, and how to arrange a family with a salary of 40 yuan, so as to provide a practical reference for people of all classes, so that they have a basis when using domestic products. This is very important.</p>
<p>We hope that factories and all sectors of society will do their best to support this exhibition and open it as soon as possible, which will have a great effect on the domestic product industry.</p>
<h3>Suggestions for Improving Domestic Product Sales</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Recently, our domestic product industry has relied on the widespread establishment of the majority of the public's confidence in protecting domestic products on the one hand, and on the other hand, it has relied on the bumper harvest in rural areas and the increase in the purchasing power of the general people in the interior. In terms of the comparison of enclosure sales, there has obviously been considerable progress. The gradual increase in the turnover of many domestic product manufacturers is indeed a very good phenomenon.</p>
<p>However, at present, we deeply feel that the domestic product industry should seize this opportunity and make greater efforts to pay attention to the improvement of domestic product sales techniques. We know that the reason why foreign goods were able to dump everywhere in our country, penetrate into remote rural areas, was mainly because they had a high degree of sales methods that could adapt to the actual conditions of various parts of our country. Therefore, it was able to possess such a large market and obtain huge sales. At present, it is also very necessary and urgent for us to strive to improve sales methods. Below, I have a few practical suggestions for improving domestic product sales in the future, and I dare to contribute them to people engaged in the domestic product industry:</p>
<p>First, pay attention to the packaging of domestic products. This is one of the most important things to pay attention to in improving the sales of domestic products. On the one hand, we must make the decoration of the goods so that buyers have a good impression of them, and we must cater to the aesthetic concepts of the local people and make different decorations. On the other hand, we should pay attention to strict packaging so that the quality of the goods is always preserved and correct the shortcomings of the past when domestic goods were often missing or damaged during transportation.</p>
<p>Second, pay attention to advertising and publicity. The ability of advertising and publicity to promote sales has long been noticed by the domestic product industry, but in the future, we should make it play a practical role, and we must conduct specific research according to the different industries, local markets, and target sales objects. In particular, we should pay attention to making in-depth efforts in expanding sales in border areas and opening up overseas markets.</p>
<p>Third, pay attention to the politeness of store clerks. How to cater to the psychology of customers? In the past, the outside world often criticized the store clerks of domestic product manufacturers for lacking politeness, so in the future, peacetime training of store clerks will also be one of the main topics in improving domestic product sales.</p>
<p>Other things, such as the need for speedy and cheap transportation of domestic products, the need for continuous improvement of the quality of domestic products, and the need for attention to the layout of shopping malls or stores, are of course all necessary to be done in improving domestic product sales. At this time when the future of domestic products is gradually improving, we hope that the domestic product industry can make greater efforts to obtain greater development of domestic production.</p>
<h3>The Decline of Agriculture in Haiyan, Silk and Cloth</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qin</p>
<p>Our country has always been known as an agricultural country, and the people are engaged in agriculture. In addition to planting large quantities of rice, wheat, cotton, and flax, the Jiangzhe area is also a gathering area for sericulture. Farmers take silkworm rearing as a sideline in their spare time from farming to supplement the farmers' economy.</p>
<p>In recent years, the dumping of foreign goods has been rampant, and the output of foreign silk has increased sharply. Both trade and materials are better than our country. Moreover, artificial silk has caused a fatal blow to our country's silk. On the other hand, our country's silk industry is on the road to decline, which is heartbreaking to say. Our country's methods of silkworm rearing and mulberry planting have followed the old methods for thousands of years. Compared with the sericulture industry in Europe and the United States and East Asian countries such as Japan, it is no wonder that it pales in comparison. The facts are obvious. People use scientific methods, while we follow the old rules, as if it were the same for thousands of years, and we do not know how to improve. Now that science is advocated, we still do not rush to catch up. Although we have heard that the government has plans to revitalize the countryside, and some people are shouting to save the countryside, the plans are, after all, plans, and the shouts are still in our ears. The farmers' pain is still invading the depths of the water and fire. Seeing this, the future of our country's silk industry will eventually be in danger and will be destroyed by foreign silk.</p>
<p>The other day, my friend Ren Wenhui came to Shanghai from Haiyan and talked about the recent decline of agriculture, cotton, silk, and linen cloth in Haiyan, which I felt very earnestly. After hearing about it, I felt something and briefly recorded it to publish in this magazine.</p>
<p>After the sericulture affairs are over, the farm women in Haiyan use manual labor to make extremely fine cotton threads from thin-skinned cocoons such as double palace cocoons; some split flax into strands and weave them into silk and cloth with wooden machines, which are sold in the nearby areas and make a good profit. Unfortunately, this handicraft industry lacks the organization of a whole silk weaving factory in Haiyan, and there is also a lack of good guidance and sticking to the old ways, so it cannot reach far to other provinces and be sold overseas. Recently, we are actively promoting domestic products. If we can invest in the rural areas of the area, set up silk weaving factories, and improve guidance, the silk and cloth produced will be strong and durable, and the price will be low and the quality will be good, which is far better than imported goods.</p>
<p>In Yongan Lake, more than 20 miles away from the county seat, residents use manual labor to split flax into strands and make linen cloth with wooden machines (commonly known as Ganpu summer cloth) in the summer. It is sold in nearby counties, and its color is yellow and white. The yellow one is called Sun, and the white one is quite good, and can be used to make summer clothes. In the past year, the local agencies, groups, gentry, etc. initiated the use of yellow linen cloth to make various summer uniforms, which are worn on the body. Even in the scorching sun, when sweating profusely, it is not greasy with sweat, and it is extremely cool and comfortable. In addition to the local woven linen cloth, in the four townships of Haiyan, elderly farmers who cannot work in the fields are engaged in weaving silk cotton. All the double palace and thin-skinned cocoons are boiled in boiling water, immersed in water, and pounded with a wooden pestle on the lake for more than ten days. After they are evenly mixed, they are dried in the sun, and then the fine silk is completely pinched by hand and woven with a wooden machine, which is called cotton silk. This cotton silk is also divided into coarse and fine, rough and white. The fine white one can be used for summer shirts and short clothes, etc., and the rough and turbid one can be dyed and used as underwear in autumn and winter. It is soft and fitting, but it is woven by hand and with wooden machines, so the products cannot compete with machine-woven silk products. However, its durability is ten thousand times greater than that of the current silk, and the price is low. The highest price is only a little more than 0.1 yuan per foot, and the lowest price is only a few cents per foot. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Factory Inspection and Domestic Industry</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>The Shanghai Factory Inspection Office was officially established on February 21 of this year and has begun operations. This is not only good news for all factories in Shanghai, but especially something that domestic factories in general feel gratified about. Because the implementation of factory inspections and the future of domestic industry are closely related.</p>
<p>In recent years, the cause of domestic products in our country has been maintained and promoted by the government authorities, and the people of all walks of life are happy to use them, which is a very significant achievement compared to a few years ago. However, if we examine the contents of a ship of domestic factories, either the safety and health equipment are not perfect, or the management technology is lacking training, so that factory disasters have not yet reached the point of complete avoidance. The explosion of the boiler in the Zhengtai Rubber Factory and the Taiyi Malted Milk Powder Factory, and the fire in the Shanghai Da Zhonghua Binluoluo Factory were all encountered great losses and many obstacles. The repeated performances of this kind of factory disaster not only have a great impact on the domestic factory itself, but the entire domestic industry is also invisibly encountering considerable obstacles. Therefore, how to prevent industrial disasters and prevent domestic factories from being hit by accidents? This is not only a problem that the principals of domestic factories should strive to solve, but from the perspective of the domestic industry, it is also a problem that we should jointly study and discuss.</p>
<p>The author believes that there are many factors to avoid the occurrence of disasters, and the practical implementation of factory inspection is indeed an effective method to reduce factory disasters. Because the work of the Factory Inspection Office is not only concerned with the factory's various records, the work conditions of child laborers, female workers, and apprentices, and the investigation of disasters, deaths, and injuries, but especially concerned with whether the factory's safety and health equipment have reached a truly proper state, in order to fundamentally eliminate factory disasters and the workers' physical health is becoming healthier day by day. This kind of work seems to be unimportant from the superficial observation, but in fact, it is closely related to the entire domestic industry, whether directly or indirectly. Because the implementation of factory inspection can directly reduce the occurrence of factory disasters, and indirectly can make the products faster and the production rate increase. At this time when the domestic industry is waiting to be supported and developed, and the people of the country are gradually happy to use domestic products, we hope that the Shanghai Factory Inspection Office can actively promote inspection work and earnestly guide the safety and health equipment of factories, which will greatly benefit the domestic product production industry. The author is pleased and willing to wait and see its effect.</p>
<h3>From the Homespun Movement to the Tai Couple</h3>
<p>— Dulin</p>
<p>Chinese women's pursuit of luxury, in their every move, they constantly imitate Western trends and compete to show off their extravagance and wealth. Therefore, "clothes must be brocade," and "residences must be luxurious," planting deep-rooted vanity in their hearts. Even women who have received higher education often cannot escape this bad idea. If you don't believe it, let's look at a fact.</p>
<p>In the news about the divorce of Dr. Tai Shuangqiu, the former dean of the Education Institute of Great China University, and Ms. Huang Jima, one can find a profound irony. The fact is this:</p>
<p>Dr. Shao Shuangqiu is a well-known figure in the education field. He usually loves domestic products and promotes homespun cloth, sparing no effort to promote it everywhere, persuading people he meets, and practicing it tirelessly. He wears homespun cloth made from raw materials spun and woven in the countryside all year round. His ardent heart is commendable. However, his wife, Ms. Huang Jima, strongly opposed it. Therefore, although Dr. Tai wore homespun cloth all year round, his wife at home may still have been "wearing brocade."</p>
<p>Because of Dr. Tai's ardent love for domestic products, he promoted it everywhere and persuaded people he met. Once, someone suddenly questioned Dr. Tai: Although Mr. Tai wears homespun cloth all year round, has he persuaded his own family to wear it too? As a result, Dr. Tai received a deep and mocking stimulus. When he returned home, he also persuaded his wife to wear homespun cloth, but the result was not only that she could not comply, but also that they disagreed and broke up. Although their divorce was officially justified, citing a difference in interests, they went through the divorce procedures at the lawyer's office and filed the case with the court. It is said that although they were divorced later, Mrs. Tai probably followed Dr. Tai's advice and wore homespun cloth. Suddenly, news of reconciliation came out, but in the end, they could not reach an agreement and eventually divorced.</p>
<p>Dr. Shao promoted the homespun movement with such a sincere heart. Although he lost his lover, he still practiced it tirelessly and did not change it at all. Now, Dr. Tai, through discussions from all sides and his own choice, has found a new wife with similar interests, Ms. Hu Peizhen, who is said to be married at the Xueyi Society on the 28th of this month. However, the union of Dr. Tai and Ms. Huang Jima was a marriage that developed from classmates, and both were engaged in education, so their views were of course superior to others. However, unexpectedly, Mrs. Tai overturned the feelings of the couple and was willing to divorce at all costs because she did not want to wear homespun cloth. From this, it can be seen that the vanity of ordinary women is more important than anything else. Here, I have another feeling: that Dr. Tai's persuasion for people to wear homespun cloth is so sincere, but he did not expect that even his wife, who is also engaged in education, could not be persuaded. How about other people who have not received education? I can't help but feel a deep pessimism about the future of pure domestic products.</p>

<h3>Today and Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Wu Shou Kang</p>
<p>Today's business must be done today; if you wait until tomorrow, at least tomorrow's business will be eroded and damaged!</p>
<p>"Hope for tomorrow today, hope for the day after tomorrow tomorrow, and you'll never get it right in your life!"—This is a colloquialism.</p>
<p>Only today, only now, is there hope, and it should be seized and not allowed to slip away lightly.</p>
<p>A person who puts things off every day, his ideals will always be bubbles. Because when tomorrow comes, he is waiting for tomorrow again and will never realize it!</p>
<p>Tomorrow, tomorrow, everyone will have a day when there is no tomorrow!</p>
<p>I really don't know how many people in the world have ruined their entire future careers because of waiting for tomorrow?</p>
<p>Today is real and can be cashed; tomorrow is abstract and intangible.</p>
<p>Friends! Opportunity stands before you, today! Don't miss it!</p>
<p>"Wait for tomorrow! Wait for tomorrow!" Thousands of people in the world have been frustrated and failed because of it.</p>
<h3>Street of Never-Sleeping</h3>
<p>— Jiao Shijie</p>
<p>Shanghai is a city that never sleeps, and the street of never-sleeping in the city that never sleeps is Zhejiang Road.</p>
<p>Between Great Horse Road and Beijing Road, this section of Zhejiang Road can indeed be called a commercial hub, and especially the night market, it surpasses the prosperity of Nanjing Road, no, it surpasses any street in Shanghai!</p>
<p>Although Shanghai is a prosperous place, after 12 o'clock at night, every street gradually becomes deserted. Most of the merchants are closed, and the sparse pedestrians on the road can no longer make it lively. The trams have stopped, and only one or two cars pass by. Thus, even the most prosperous Great Horse Road during the day seems to be tired and dead, leaving only the light of the street lamps. Although when the theaters and dance halls are dismissed, a large group of tired people come out, but in an instant, this lively scene is quiet again, and even if it is lively, it is only a small piece of liveliness, how can it compare to the liveliness of Zhejiang Road!</p>
<p>On Zhejiang Road, this street of never-sleeping, there are many shops selling shoes and hats, restaurants, and small department stores. In the windows of those shops, the lights of neon lights are shining everywhere, and the voices of people are warm and bustling; when the west wind blows, the flags of Yangcheng Lake crabs suddenly increase on this road. Usually, there are also constant fruit vendors, arranged in a line, shouting their wares with different voices but the same tune.</p>
<p>When the lights are on and the tourists are like a swarm of bees, the prostitutes on the street are dispatched like a general mobilization order. Wearing dazzling clothes, smearing white powder, and applying red rouge, they patrol back and forth, exuding fragrance like flowers and plants, to seduce bees and butterflies to go crazy.</p>
<p>The prosperity of Zhejiang Road extends all the way to three or four o'clock, even dawn. Ah, this is the street that never sleeps!</p>
<p>The city that never sleeps has the street that never sleeps, so it deserves its name. The street that never sleeps is sheltered in the city that never sleeps, boosting its prosperity.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Secret Transmission of the Golden Needle</h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>The method of golden needles has been around for a long time. Some say it was created by the Yellow Emperor, but when I read the Biography of Bian Que and Cang Gong in the Records of the Grand Historian, I know that this method was already popular between the Zhou and Qin dynasties. Although the statement that the Yellow Emperor created it may be a forgery, it is undoubtedly the oldest and most scientific medical technique in Chinese medicine. Its transmission is mostly taught by masters and disciples, emphasizing practice rather than empty talk. Scholars often suffer from the difficulty of recognizing acupoints and give up. Therefore, its transmission is narrow, and it is declining today. How can a few inches of needles cure all diseases? Those who study science may doubt its absurdity. However, the meridians and acupoints are not unrelated to the sympathetic nervous system, and the efficacy of acupuncture is not different from the effect of endocrine. Although its technique is magical, its principle is true and cannot be doubted by what cannot be explained in anatomy. For this reason, advanced countries in European medicine have paid attention to this. The Paris Municipal Hospital recently established a Chinese acupuncture department, and many diseases are treated with golden needles. The medical school also uses scientific methods for concrete research. But in our country it is not the case. Most people in this field secretly hide their skills. Those who have a smattering of knowledge are needless to say, even those who have a thorough understanding of it are mostly secretive. Those who ask about it, some tell one or two, and hide seven or eight, or show the surface and hide the essence, or strongly say that it is difficult, so that the questioner knows the difficulty and stops, or make absurd remarks, so that scholars take the false as true. Even their disciples are not willing to teach them wholeheartedly, let alone others? Knowing but not willing to speak, speaking but not willing to tell all, in order to leave room for self-preservation, and ignoring the preservation of learning, this is the reason why acupuncture is declining in China. Fang Jun Shen'an is a golden needle expert today. He hangs his pot on the sea and is famous for a time. He has always hated the secrecy of his colleagues and feared the loss of acupuncture because of this. Those who ask for advice must tell him the secrets; and he wrote a book called Secret Transmission of Golden Needles to promote acupuncture to the world. His intention is good. Learning is a public tool of the world, and medicine is a benevolent technique to help the world. Secrecy is to regard public tools as private property and to regard benevolent techniques as a way to profit. Jun has seen this, so he wrote out his master's true biography and made it public to the world. Isn't it a benevolent intention? Jun's exposition of acupuncture is already detailed and without omission, and there are more than ten acupoints for the solution of fainting needles, which is not comparable to ordinary golden needle books. Those who are interested in this, take it and read it, and can understand its secrets without a teacher, isn't it better than seeking a teacher for thousands of miles and never getting the hang of it for life? This is why I am happy to write a preface to it.</p>
<h3>Yang Guifei's Stealing</h3>
<p>— Hua Binghe</p>
<p>Accidentally, I talked with a few friends about the story of stealing, starting from Dongfang Shuo stealing peaches, then Chang'e stealing medicine, then Han Shou stealing incense, and finally talking about Yang Guifei.</p>
<p>A wife is not as good as a concubine, a concubine is not as good as stealing, but is it not so for women; I remember that in the Outer Biography of Dazhen, there is such a record: "There are three sisters, all plump and well-groomed, good at teasing and joking, and good at meaning. Every time they enter the palace, they move the square out... Therefore, Zhang You sometimes said: 'Sneaking into Korea with a secret visit, the Yichun courtyard reflects the flowering branches. The golden chariot goes far away and no one sees it, secretly playing the flute of Prince He.'" This word "stealing" is very tasteful, and Zhang You himself said in his poem: "No one sees the pear blossoms in the deep courtyard, idly playing the jade flute of Prince Ning." From these two poems, it is not difficult to imagine how promiscuous Guifei was.</p>
<p>Regarding Guifei and An Lushan, Yuan Suiyuan has two lines of poetry: "The Old and New Tang Books are clearly there, how can there be money to wash away Lujian." That's right, the Old Tang Book does not record this matter, no wonder Suiyuan is proud of being able to clear Guifei's grievances, considering it his most得意手笔; in fact, even if there is such a thing, thinking from the meaning of stealing, it is a bit too stupid, not to mention that Guifei is an exceptionally smart woman, and Ming Huang is not a fool after all.</p>
<p>However, I am always a little suspicious that when she was admiring the peonies in the Chenxiang Pavilion, she clearly liked Li Taibai's Qingping Tune, because there were words comparing her to Zhao Feiyan, and she was inexplicably angered by Taibai because of a few 胡縐words, if she did not steal, she would be too suspicious.</p>
<h3>The Xixia People's Worship of Cattle</h3>
<p>— Liping</p>
<p>Xixia, within the territory of China, is considered a remote land. The residents there mostly maintain a state of ancient society, so all lifestyles are somewhat mythologized. Especially the worship of cattle is the only sacred thing in the superstition of the Xixia people.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the Xixia people, the cattle god is almost more sacred than all the gods. Therefore, all life is mostly dominated by the authority of the cattle god. For example, marriage, when local men and women are to be married, they must go to the temple of the cattle god to ask for a decision. If the cattle god's decision is good, then no matter how unsuitable the marriage is, it must be accomplished. If the cattle god's decision is not good, everyone has to do as they are told and dare not resist. At the same time, the wedding date is also determined by the god. On the wedding day, the newly married men and women, parents, clan chiefs, etc. must also go to the cattle god temple to hold the wedding ceremony. In addition to marriage, what is more interesting is having children. If a son is born, the pregnant woman must go to the temple every day to pray within a month before delivery. On the day the son is born, a cow is pulled from outside and the newborn child is snuggled next to the cow. Only after spending the night can the child be carried into the house. After the full moon, the child must be tied to the back of the cow for a whole day. On the day of entertaining guests, the cow is slaughtered to be used as a dish for entertaining guests. The above two customs are a kind of superstition of worshiping cattle in Xixia.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Limin Coal Mine in Xishan, Dongting</h3>
<p>— Luo Zheng</p>
<p>For the past few days, I have been trapped in the house by the continuous cold rain, and I couldn't even go to town once. The boundless loneliness surrounded me, making me feel disgusted with this desolate village life. Fortunately, the rain stopped today, so the wish to visit the Limin Coal Mine, which I have had for a week, can finally be realized.</p>
<p>After passing Tianwangmen, you can see a row of black bamboo fences. In the middle of the black bamboo fences, we found a city gate-like gate. Beside it, a copper plaque was quietly hung, and the regular script characters of "Limin Coal Mine Company" were smiling at us.</p>
<p>Walking through the gate, you can see the busy scene inside the mine. The noisy sound suddenly filled my ears. We went to the office on the left first, but it was quiet and there was no one there. In front of the warehouse, we met the mine director Zhao Jun. He was directing the construction project below the mine tunnel. Seeing him holding a construction ruler in his hand, running back and forth, he looked very busy, but when he saw us, he put down his work and greeted us with a smile.</p>
<p>We seemed to be very familiar with it and automatically broke into the inside. Zhao Jun also followed us. In front of a mine tunnel, there were many miners working. The sound of the motor was軋軋軋, which was fast or slow depending on the impact of the mine board. The black coal blocks were hoisted from the mine tunnel, which was thirty-two feet deep, to the mine site by the motor winch, one basket after another. Then, the four-wheeled iron car carried them, climbed along the winding narrow-gauge railway, and sent them into the warehouse.</p>
<p>The sharp whistle sounded three times in the gray air. The miners who were on shift all put on black, shiny oilcloth clothes and hats, gathered in the workshop, lit their small carbide lamps, and were assigned by the foreman to wait at the mouth of the mine tunnel with this shift's supervisors to change shifts. The winch quickly hoisted up from the ground below, bringing up groups of coal miners. Their faces were all covered with black marks, and their clothes were wet. Each person held a carbide lamp in their hand, and the small flame was swaying in the wind. At the same time, groups of miners on the mine site were sent by the winch to the black and deep coal well.</p>
<p>After seeing the mine tunnel, we wanted to go down ourselves and experience the life under the ground, but according to Zhao Jun, to go down the tunnel, you must wear oilcloth clothes and hats. Today, the mine engineer Wang Xifan, the general manager Wang Ziweng, and others will all go down. When the company's oilcloth clothes are available in a day, you can let me wear them down once. Afterwards, we were led by Zhao Jun to inspect the mining area and visit the workshops of the miners, carpenters, bamboo workers, motors, and water pumps. Behind the workshop of the engineering office, countless pine trees were piled up. It is said that they were the wood for the project below the mine tunnel. They usually had thousands of dollars worth of wood stored. Now they are still sorting out the mine tunnel, and the amount of coal produced is only enough for their own use. In the future, when the second mine tunnel is sorted out and coal mining officially starts, the amount of wood needed will be even more extensive. While we were talking, General Affairs Director Yu came with Mr. Wang Ziweng and others. He greeted Mr. Wang and others to go down the mine tunnel, and then came to entertain us. So we talked to him in a delicate and simple reception room about the mine situation and the coal mine overview, until it rained and we bid farewell.</p>
<h3>Phoenix and Luan Change Nests</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: White Paper and Red Letter Empty Return Two Lines of Moji Flowers and Maple Leaves Alone Walk Half a City in Autumn</p>
<p>Xiao Song seemed to take this sentence very seriously. He put down the teacup, pressed his knees with both hands, and looked at him and said: Don't think that the characters in Zhaoqiao Miscellaneous Records are all vulgar. There are also some admirable women here. You are not willing to go to this kind of place. If you supervise me to go to these places to see them twice, you will definitely not be able to deny them all. Guoqi bowed his hands twice. Although he didn't say anything, on his smiling face, he clearly declined. Xiao Song saw this situation and didn't continue to talk. He said: I copied these poems of yours. How about I write a few to match them? Guoqi said: I haven't finished writing the novel yet, and you want to write poems to match them. It seems that everyone is promoting each other a little. After I publish them in the magazine, you can write them. Xiao Song laughed: As I see it, these poems of yours will never be published. Saying that, he got up and folded the poems several times, put them in the drawer, took the hat hanging on the hanger in his hand, bowed half a bow to him, and smiled: I think you want to write more than just these few poems. I'm interrupting your poetic inspiration here. Saying that, he hurried out. Guoqi felt that his departure was somewhat due to avoiding suspicion, and he felt even more uneasy, so he followed behind and sent him out of the gate. And he was talking, sending him to the entrance of the alley. At this time, a girl came in front of her, wearing a green cotton-padded jacket with a mandarin duck pattern and a long cyan crepe skirt. The black patent leather shoes made a slight sound on the ground. Her forehead had long bangs hanging down, and her snow-white face had two light red blushes, which were very beautiful. Xiao Song saw her from afar and felt that his eyes were absorbed by her. When she slowly walked in front of him, her big eyes drooped her eyelids, surrounding two eyelashes on the outside. (149)</p>

<p>Talking</p>
<h3>More on Kicking Shuttlecock and Flying Kites</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I saw the order from the Central Propaganda Department advocating kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites, which aroused my interest in the games of my childhood, so I wrote an article. Unexpectedly, after this article was written, before it was sent to this publication, Mr. Luo's article on the same topic had already been published. Fortunately, although the topics are the same, the feelings are different, and there are some supplementary opinions in my humble work, so I will still send this manuscript. I am afraid that there will inevitably be the shame of drawing a snake and adding feet. I hope the readers will forgive me.</p>
<p>If you talk about kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites, I can be considered an old insider, because I am old and an insider. I can be regarded as worthy of the three words old insider. Speaking of kicking shuttlecocks? I am proficient in the eight skills of lifting, accompanying, turning, bumping, left, practicing, rare, and 跥. The so-called 跥 is to kick the shuttlecock high with the back of the foot. I can't write the word 跥, so let's replace it with the word 跥? In addition, there is also打跳. The so-called 打跳 is to jump up and kick high backwards with the right foot. This is a further step in the art of kicking shuttlecocks. Speaking of flying kites? I have flown many kinds of kites, such as big colorful kites, small colorful kites, figure kites, eagle kites, butterfly kites, toilet kites, and centipede kites. And I have a lot of research and experience, because when I was young, I was reluctant to study, but I had a special interest and special preference for the above two games, so I am especially authentic in these two things.</p>
<p>However, the most suffered person was an old mother, because of the sake of kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites, I often got muddy and fought like frogs, and one pair of shoes a month was not enough. The toes of the shoes were often broken and the soles of the socks were worn through. Therefore, I often got scolded as a useless thing, a beggar's坯子. But let her scold as much as she wants, and let her beat as much as she wants. I can't help but fly kites, and I can't help but kick shuttlecocks. Now I think about it, it is really unjust and sinful to eat this kind of scolding. I regret that I was born decades earlier. Assuming that I was born decades later, not only could I avoid eating this kind of scolding, but I could also take the kites and shuttlecocks and wander away like I was ordered by the emperor. Parents would only smile at it, or even praise my good son.</p>
<p>I still think about when I was young, not only did I have the above two hobbies, but I also had a special art, which was rolling copper coins. I think this game is more interesting than flying kites and kicking shuttlecocks, because rolling copper coins all depends on eyesight and technique. The distance and bias of the coins depends on the hand, and the hitting of the coins depends on the eye. Therefore, this game has a close relationship with the eyesight and technique of children, and there is a lot of research. When I was more than ten years old, I could hit the coin from one or two feet away, and I could measure it. I was an expert in rolling copper coins among the children. Therefore, several children, seeing that I was inside, often stood by and watched, unwilling to cooperate with me, because cooperation would definitely lead to my loss. I have an obligation to be the best at these children's games in the feudal era.</p>
<p>The central government advocates kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites. I think the game of rolling copper coins may also be promoted, because the reason why the central government advocates kicking shuttlecocks and flying kites is nothing more than to increase the physical strength and activity of children, which has a great relationship with the health of children. However, the game of rolling copper coins is also very beneficial to children's eyesight and technique. And kites are only flown in spring, and kicking shuttlecocks is mostly in winter. They are mostly seasonal. Only rolling copper coins is possible at any time, whether spring, summer, autumn, or winter. It is easier to practice skillfully. Assuming that the age is slightly older, or military training, when hitting the target, or when war occurs, when enlisting in the army, their shooting ability will definitely surpass ordinary people. This is why rolling copper coins also needs to be promoted.</p>
<h3>"Wise Mother"'s "Motherly Education"</h3>
<p>— Xin Xin</p>
<p>With more than ten days left until Children's Day, a certain women's education center has already decided on the methods for the "Motherly Education Competition" to be held on Children's Day and has published it in the newspaper. This shows their concern for children, which is truly admirable.</p>
<p>Examining the reasons for holding the "Motherly Education Competition," the "Competition Purpose" states it clearly: "This center aims to promote the sense of responsibility among mothers in each family and to create a social atmosphere that values wise mothers. Therefore, we have decided to hold the Motherly Education Competition once every year on Children's Day." The competition items are divided into ㊀ Physique, ㊁ Cleanliness, ㊂ Politeness, ㊃ Demeanor. The scoring method is as follows: Physique is graded out of 30 points, Cleanliness out of 20 points, and Politeness and Demeanor are each graded out of 25 points.</p>
<p>Now, let's first talk about "wise mother." Mr. Guo Moruo said in an essay titled "On Turning Heaven and Earth": "The way of concubines in ancient times, such as 'not disobeying the husband to make obedience the correct path,' or 'following the son after the husband's death,' or 'a mother becomes noble through her son,' does not even qualify as a wife or a mother, let alone being considered 'wise' or 'good,' right? However, such wives and mothers who are slaves to cosmetics and also slaves to the family are precisely the 'wise wives and good mothers' that ancient people and even some people today long for. The reason why such wives and mothers are 'wise' and 'good' is probably because they are like 'clear breeze and bright moon that don't cost a penny to buy, which is much more economical than prostitutes and wet nurses, right?'" He then used a biological perspective to advocate for "turning heaven and earth" in many ways. After reading the "purpose" of the "Motherly Education Competition"—"to promote the sense of responsibility among mothers in each family and to create a social atmosphere that values wise mothers"—I cannot help but think of what he said: "They painstakingly want to bind women's fate to the lifelong and hereditary position of obligatory prostitutes and wet nurses, and they beautify it by calling them wise wives and good mothers." And this sobering taste of 'wisdom and goodness' seems to have once again intoxicated the Nalas of the past and called them back to the 'dollhouse'." (See the same article)</p>
<p>If the so-called "wise mother" is like this, then what are the children under such "motherly education" of a "wise mother" like? They can be roughly divided into two types. One type, we can imagine from the three competition items, must be children who are chubby and white and have "education," with very clean clothes, know to wash their hands before eating, and perhaps even say "Yes" or "No" when "responding." When they see unclean little companions, they may quickly avoid them, or even kick them a few times with their little leather shoes, or tell the maids to drive the "little beggars" away.</p>
<p>These children with "education," when graded, will naturally be given a "perfect score." As for the children under the "motherly education" of the other type of "wise mother," their physique may have a few points that are naturally endowed, barely enough to pass, but most of them suffer from congenital deficiencies and acquired maladjustments, and are mostly "skin and bones." As for cleanliness, politeness, and demeanor, there is naturally no need to mention them. Because they are used to being kicked by the former type of children, they can only timidly hide when they see them, lest they get a few more bruises on their buttocks. Even if there are those who are unwilling to submit and dare to fight back, it is obviously too bad in terms of "politeness" and they still fail.</p>
<p>The latter type of children, of course, will not even have the qualifications to participate in the competition. For example, "All participants must be led by their mothers to the center to register, submit two 4-inch half-length photos of the mother and child or mother and daughter, receive a competition certificate, and come to the center for the competition at the specified date and time." They will not have such spare time and photos. In fact, even if they did, they would definitely use this money and spare time to sew a new dress for their children first, and then take their children to the City God Temple or something to kowtow to the wooden idols, asking the Bodhisattva to protect their children as they grow up.</p>
<p>Now, there are more than ten days left until Children's Day. On that day, in addition to this "Motherly Education Competition" that "promotes the sense of responsibility among mothers" and "creates a social atmosphere that values wise mothers," there will definitely be other new and fresh things. However, what will our children get? It is hard to say.</p>
<p>According to my current thoughts, I want to cancel Children's Day.</p>
<h3>The Great Pharmacy</h3>
<p>— Sky</p>
<p>Complete Consultation Rooms</p>
<p>If you take trolleybus No. 17 to Simalu and Henan Road, you can hear the ticket seller shouting: "Wuzhou Pharmacy has arrived." From this point, you can know the fame of Wuzhou Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy is famous not only because of its wide range and excellent products, but also because it can use various methods to enthusiastically serve the community at any time. For example, the ten-story building of the main store has specially opened medical consultation rooms for various departments inside (on the fourth floor, accessible by elevator). The consultation rooms are very well-equipped, and each department is staffed by famous doctors from Shanghai who are responsible for treatment, eliminating the disadvantages of being simple and negligent. Furthermore, in view of the fact that patients often have to wait a long time to fill prescriptions, which inevitably causes anxiety, a prescription receiving office is specially attached to the consultation room department. After the diagnosis, the prescription is filled immediately and can be taken back for consumption, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>The great pharmacy has complete consultation rooms, making it convenient for patients to both consult a doctor and fill a prescription. How can this not be said to be the gospel of the community?</p>

<p>Three years ago, on a gloomy afternoon, the mud worker foreman left her and an not-so-small estate behind, and went to sleep forever in a pair of floral-patterned wooden beds.</p>
<p>From then on, she began to manage those properties without help or care. From a young age, she was a bit silly, clumsy, and didn't understand the ways of the world. After marriage, other than her leisurely physique becoming stronger, nothing changed. Initially, she let several acres of vegetable gardens go to waste, and then even the orchards were neglected. Therefore, the neighbors held a mocking attitude. First, they often sneaked into the vegetable garden at night to steal cucumbers and cabbages, or pretended to unintentionally let cattle and sheep in; then, they instructed those naughty teenagers to climb over the walls and pick large bags of fruit when the fruits were ripe.</p>
<p>The first season passed, and the manager of the property lost sixty-five percent of her total harvest. Only then did she discover how the neighbors were stealing without her noticing! She became frantic, brandishing a short wooden stick in her hand and sitting on the stone steps in front of the door, cursing all day long. The neighbors who were being cursed dared not come out to argue, but pointed at the naughty teenagers, brought their dogs, and came out to throw stones at her. When a stone was thrown at her, the dog followed to try to bite the stone, but she thought it was coming to bite her, so she shouted and threatened, raising the short wooden stick in her hand to hit it. This angered the dog, and she was injured as a result.</p>
<p>For a long time, she lay down, and dirty blood flowed from her legs. She couldn't run, she could only crawl. The neighbors felt very proud. They no longer had to sneak into her vegetable garden late at night, nor did they have to instruct people to dare to enter her orchard. They openly stole cucumbers and fruits. Later, when there were no more cucumbers and the fruit season passed, they carried hoes and axes to dig up the barren tree trunks in the orchard, and then chopped them into hundreds of small pieces for firewood. Sometimes, because the distribution of this loot was uneven, the neighbors fought, using hoes and short wooden sticks, and sometimes even using knives to stab each other. It wasn't until a series of muffled coughs came from the small house that they timidly dropped their weapons and hid in the weeds.</p>
<p>She was sick for a long time, and she lost her health. Having grown accustomed to crawling, she couldn't stand up. Sometimes she forgot and tried to stand up, but the result was only tears in her eyes, shaking her head and sitting down again. She was disabled.</p>
<p>Her face was thin and pale, but she hadn't lost her beauty. The death of the mud worker foreman, the encroachment on her property, the illness, the disability, none of them made her smarter. She still lived in a daze, not understanding everything, not believing in everything...</p>
<p>After her illness, because the long period of indoor life was too dull, she came out with the help of a wooden stool and sat on the stone steps to bask in the sun, or took off her lower body clothes to find fleas. Her plump, unspoiled body of a young woman, like her orchard and cucumbers, became attractive. At this time, her orchard was so bare that there wasn't even a single weed, the fence outside the vegetable garden had already been broken, and there was nothing but weeds in the field.</p>
<p>Soon, late at night, bold and impoverished young men from the neighbors lingered outside her desolate door. When he saw that the surroundings were quiet, he gently pushed the door open and went in. How he subdued her inside, how he made her lie naked on the dirty bed, no one knows. However, people often heard sobbing and panting, until a shadow flashed out from the back door, and all the mysterious sounds became silent again.</p>
<p>The news spread, and about a dozen young men rotated through her house at midnight. But when her belly developed a strange change and swelled up, she was forgotten like a pair of broken straw shoes.</p>
<p>On a peaceful, warm spring night, someone heard a small burst of infant crying coming from the house. The next day, they saw that the little life was already cold, but she was still holding it tightly to her naked chest as if she were holding a living thing, with a smile of happiness on the corner of her mouth that had never been seen before.</p>

<h3>The Prosperous American Automobile Export Industry</h3>
<p>— Ke</p>
<p>The American automobile export industry in 1936 can be said to have been the best year since 1929. Therefore, people in the automobile industry predict that the export industry this year—1937—will also have a bright future. It is said that there are two reasons for the prosperity of American automobile exports. One is the dominance of foreign exchange, and the other is the recovery and prosperity of various industries, both of which are conducive to the export industry. In particular, the abolition of tariff barriers and the replacement with reciprocal commercial agreements have resulted in the improvement of the export industry.</p>
<p>If we look back at the American automobile overseas sales market in 1929, we can see that the overseas sales were not bad at that time. Including the production volume in Canada, the number of American exports at that time had reached as high as 1,000,000 vehicles. However, the arrival of the recession turned the good results into a complete failure. In 1932, American automobile exporters only reached 181,280 vehicles. Compared with the total number in 1929, isn't that a sharp decline? Fortunately, from that year on, the situation gradually improved, and the overseas market for American automobiles gradually had hope of recovery. By 1936, the number of exports had reached about 600,000 vehicles.</p>
<p>The heads of the export departments of American automobile factories all have the hope of rebuilding the good dream of 1929. In fact, reaching the old position of 1,000,000 vehicles is not a simple matter. However, some people always yearn to reach that number of one million vehicles. So when is this time? It is said that this period is 1937. Regarding this statement, if we want to explain the reasons in detail, then most of the automobile factory leaders are very confident that their export volume can increase by 20% in 1937. The only condition for achieving this goal is to see how they proceed to achieve greater success in commercial agreements. Among the many foreign markets in the United States, South Africa has undoubtedly become the single largest market for American automobiles. Last year, the sales of American automobiles there exceeded any other region. Therefore, everyone has high hopes for her this year as well.</p>
<p>There are also many good customers of American automobiles in Europe, such as Belgium, the Netherlands, and Scandinavia, all of which have good markets. There is a specially built ship that transports automobiles directly from Gedero to Norway, Switzerland, and Denmark. Their route starts from the United States, passes through the Great Lakes, and goes forward. The shipment of American automobiles to France, Italy, and Germany has not yet seen much increase. This is because the tariff barriers of these countries have not yet been broken through for the time being.</p>
<p>Australia was originally a good destination for American automobiles, but recently it has reformed its tax rates and has strict restrictions on the import of American automobile bodies, and the situation is tense. It seems that in the near future, restrictions will also be imposed on chassis. This condition is most unfavorable for independent automobile factories. As for Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler, because they either have their own factories in Australia or have contracts with local factories, there will be no problems.</p>
<p>Regarding Asia, China and India originally sold a considerable number of American automobiles. The sales in China have not been bad recently. Because many new roads have been built in India, the number of exports in the future will definitely increase.</p>
<p>Many countries south of the United States are giving American automobiles a good opportunity for foreign sales. The United States has established reciprocal commercial agreements with Cuba, Colombia, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Brazil, all of which can greatly promote the foreign sales of American cars.</p>
<p>Since American automobiles changed to launching new cars in the autumn, it has greatly benefited the automobile export industry. American car dealers can use this to compete with French or British automobiles.</p>
<p>In the countries of the Southern Hemisphere, people buy new cars at the beginning of spring and summer, because the seasons there are the opposite of those in the United States. What should be noted here is that last year, half of the American automobiles were exported to countries south of the equator.</p>
<p>The products of American automobile factories have all achieved good export industries. Last year, General Motors and Chrysler were especially outstanding. General Motors' new factories in Linthai and New Jersey will use some of their strength to specialize in Buick, Waltersmobiel, and Bintak cars for foreign sales. In the two months of September and October last year, Parker transported 1,200 exported automobiles, while in the same period the year before last, it was only 399 vehicles. In addition to this, the factory also has many orders in the process of being rushed to completion.</p>
<h3>Increased Production of Willys-Overland Small Cars</h3>
<p>In recent years, the increase in gasoline prices has created a new outlet for small cars. Small cars are convenient to drive and can save on gasoline consumption. The "Fiat 500" car produced in Italy, Europe, has already become popular everywhere, and in the United States, the "Willys-Overland" small car is the most popular. Therefore, the production volume has increased sharply. According to the recent announcement by Mr. David Willys, General Manager of the factory, from November 30 last year to February 15 this year, the factory has produced as many as 15,169 vehicles. In particular, in the last half month, from January 1 to 15, it produced 4,561 vehicles, an increase of 51% compared to the first fifteen days of January this year, which produced 1,551 vehicles. All of these products have been sold in various states in the United States. Because its price is cheaper than other cars, and its installment payments are especially cheap, it is extremely popular among the local people. Each gallon of gasoline can provide 35 miles of travel, which can be said to be cheap and high-quality. The first batch of new cars will arrive in Shanghai soon. At that time, they will definitely shine in Shanghai. It is conceivable that the people of Shanghai will rush to buy them, and the grand occasion can be predicted.</p>
<h3>The All-Steel Body Feature of the New Ford V8 Car</h3>
<p>The largest steel stamping ever used in Ford automobile manufacturing forms the top of the body of all 1937 Ford V8 sedan bodies.</p>
<p>This brand new Ford V8 body is purely made of steel. All frame structures, floorboards, and panels are also made of steel, not just the roof. This is the biggest advancement in body design since Ford adopted steel bodies a few years ago.</p>
<p>The huge steel roof starts from the front windshield and extends to the bottom of the rear window, reaching the top of the doors and the edges of the panels on both sides. It is made in one go and is electrically forged to connect it with the internal steel panels and steel floorboards of the body structure to form a giant body that is strong, powerful, and accurate, maximizing the protective power of the car body.</p>
<p>No wood is used in any part of the body structure. Even where decorations are nailed, wood is not used, but special nailing materials are used instead.</p>
<h3>An Overview of the American Automobile Industry in the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. In the blink of an eye, the year 1936 is about to pass completely. Therefore, at this time of the year-end, the results of the automobile industry in European and American countries this year can be generally seen. What I want to tell the readers here is an overview of the American automobile industry in the past year.</p>
<p>In the most recent year, when it comes to the American automobile industry, there has been considerable prosperity. Just in terms of commercial vehicles and trucks, the sales of each factory, it is said, have never had such a record since the beginning of the recession. The sales of trucks this year have even exceeded the figures of the heyday of 1929. In short, such high sales of trucks have never occurred in the history of the American automobile industry. According to what the American automobile industry had previously predicted, the registration number of new trucks in 1936 could reach 600,000 vehicles, but in 1929 it was only 527,057 vehicles. The high number of truck sales is not an accident, because the beginning of 1936 had a special boom in sales, and it was already expected that this year would create a record high. Moreover, in terms of this autumn, the products of each factory could not even meet the needs of the car dealers, because most of the car dealers at that time had no inventory left. As a result, some car dealers stopped competing with their peers for a while because they lacked trucks to sell.</p>
<p>Among the trucks produced by American factories, there are two types of customers who have increased particularly - farmers and construction companies. Just in terms of farmers, it is said that this year, among the trucks sold by each factory, more than one in four were purchased by farmers. Since the beginning of the recession, the worst years, it can be said that farmers did not buy trucks at all. Although a small number of farmers in some places still bought towing vehicles, most of the factories said that customers, especially farmers, had been greatly affected due to the drought and were almost completely extinct. But the situation is different this year. The trucks of each factory have made rapid progress, and farmers also occupy a considerable proportion of the customers. The main reason is that the selling prices of agricultural products have increased. In some places, this year is even a bumper harvest. Therefore, the purchasing power of farmers has also increased a lot. The rapid development of the construction industry has of course also led to an increase in truck sales. Construction companies mostly buy trucks to transport materials in order to complete the contracts as soon as possible. Even merchants who operate transportation businesses are willing to spend more money to buy a truck to transport goods for the sake of speed and convenience. Even those who operate transportation businesses have replaced small cars with trucks in order to reduce transportation costs. Therefore, each automobile factory has always expressed optimism about the automobile industry this year. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Car Counter</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>When a car is driving on the highway, it is not easy to record and calculate the number of cars that pass by in a specified time. Someone in the United States has now invented such a machine that can record the number of vehicles passing by in a specified time, and also record the date, time, and minutes. In addition, it can also record the sum of the total number of vehicles within each hour, including the time. This machine is created using the principle of electric eyes.</p>
<p>The inventor of this machine is the Commercial Machines Company of New York City, USA. The manufacturing principle includes two major parts. One part includes a photographic vacuum tube and two photographic lenses. The other part is two light source machines placed opposite each other on the side of the road. The infrared filter allows the light to be invisible to the naked eye, so car drivers will not be bothered by the glare of the light. In addition to cars, pedestrians walking through the light do not have a counting effect. The American Highway Authority has adopted this machine to calculate the number of vehicles passing by on the road.</p>
