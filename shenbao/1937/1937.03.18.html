<p>上、有種種缺點、非痛下決心埋頭苦幹、不足以救亡圖存、所以廿二年七月二十八日蔣委員長和兄弟、曾有通電、說明今日要務、在對外方面、應該確定最低限度與最𢓭犧牲之決心、在對內方面、則治標莫急於剿除共匪、治本莫急於生產建設、自是以來、蔣委員長千辛萬苦、領導同志、努力從事、就剿匪而論、由江西而湖南、而貴州雲南四川、以至於西北、眼看的肅清了、忽然有去年十二月十二日之變、幾乎搖動根本、幸而轉危為安、加以處置得宜、大概剿匪工作、在最近期間、可以結束了、就生產建設而論、這幾年間也做了些、詳細節目、不遑枚舉、然這些結果、是不能滿意的、不但不能滿意、而宜發現了很大的危機、這危機是什么呢、便是物質建設方面、雖做了些、而精神方面、却有很大的挫折、因為國難越逼越緊、有心肝有熱血的人們、痛心時局、不能充分了解埋頭苦幹的意義、因之失望者有之、激而橫決者亦有之、這已經很可惜了、至於沒心肝沒熱血的人們、則索性因之中了惰性、以為叫以偷安、可以得過且過、而最下流的、則公然想以作漢奸為得計、這種危機、在二十四年六七八九幾個月間、到了極吃緊的關頭了、在這期間、身緊黨國安危的將委員長、看清此點、由四川飛回南京、主持四屆六中全會、同時身繋黨國安危的閻主任、也看清此點、由太原飛到南京、共同主持四屆六中全會、以至五屆全國代表大會的大計、自此以𢓭、蔣委員長主報中構、閻主任身當晋綏保險之大任、同心戮力、以期挽救國家民族的最大危機、兄弟在這期間、因傷病交攻、旣不死又不工作、想起來實在難過、及至緩遠守十抗戰、有了事實的表現、這種危機、才挽救過去的、換句話說、便是國家民族的存在精社、由頹喪而振奮起來了、綏遠守土找戰之有關於國家民族、其最大意義卽在於此、剛總聽見主席的話、對於守土抗戰不自滿足、這不但可見主席的謙德、並且可見主席的遠識、因為我們現在國難並未解除、也許將來更加嚴重、我們度德量力、仍然要埋頭苦幹、仍然要向生產建設猛力前進、以期充實民力、增進國力、全國不用說、卽以綏遠而論、民生無疾苦、非從社會經濟大加改進、縱有熱心、亦不能担負更大的責任、而財政困難、種種建設不參實現、也正是軍政當局所困心衝慮的、所以生產建設、是我們對內求自立、對外求共存之必要條件、我們決不肯錯過時間、我們必然努力不懈、但是我們的最低限度最𢓭犧牲、決不因此而有所放棄、換句話說、我們有一刻的生命、必一刻用於生產建設、但是到了最低限度需要最𢓭·犧牲的時候、我們必然將幾年以來所有生產建設的積累、以及我們的生命、一齊的為國家民族而拋擲、決不有一亳顧惜、如果有人要我們一塊領土、須知這一塊領土必滴滿了我們的血、絕對不容許輕易踏過的、也絕對不能踏過的、我們昨日看見了為守土抗戰而陣亡的烈士墳墓了、我們決不讓他們獨死、我們獨生、我們為繼續他們守土抗戰的遺志而生、我們為繼續他們守土抗戰的遣志而死、我們只有兩個歸宿、共一是人人為守土抗戰而死、使中華民國為四萬萬人的公墳墓、其二是使中華民國走上了自由平等的大路、我們的子孫共有共享和天堂一般的快樂、（十七日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>親仁善隣涵義之闡釋</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>日經濟考察團兒玉謙次等一行抵京後。備受各方之招待。行政院蔣院長以黨國領袖立塲。歡迎嘉賓蒞止。曾於盃盤酬酢之頃。致其㬅妙懇切之辭。辭中述及日本澀澤子爵提－示論語中“己所不欲勿施於人”兩語。認為係東方精神之特點。希望在座俱能善體斯意。一如子爵。最後並以“仁親為寶”一語奉贈兒玉。而歸根結謳於彼此共同為親仁著隣而努力。絃外不盡之音。一以委婉出之。在主人可謂善於詞令。在聞者能無怦然於懷。吾人不敏。更願就此親仁善隣四字一闡釋之。</p>
<p>處世界文明銳進之今日。戰爭之被詛咒。殆已深入人心。雖有一二讀武主義者。正在極端攪掀肅殺之風雲。而大多數國家。固無時不以勝殘去殺為灼慮。努力於和平局面之保持。觀仁之義。於斯為亟。至壤地毘接之中日兩國。具氣類相恤之密切磁係。其應講求善隣之道。誠亦彼此所夙稔者。不幸過去事實。離奇太甚。南轅北轍。欲遵無由。我於創巨痛深之餘。猶復篤守友誼。曲自隱忍。紙以親仁太邊之故。轉使吾隣不易為善。負疚之深。唯在於此。兒玉一行茲來之使命。固以改進中日關係為號召者。則於蔣之贈言。必能樂予接受。至所稱為共同努力者。或者以為我於親仁善隣一點。已至親無可親善無可善之境。茲𢓭唯有期待彼方之力行。實無吾人再事努力之餘地。不知被此情况。隔閡滋深。在兒玉等縱能有“仁親為實”之領悟。知發揮東方精神之特點。而其親仁善隣之主張。能否不遭有力之製肘。正復大是疑問。如何消除此項窒碍。以獲覩𠤤正善隣之協調。則仍有待於我方之推動。所謂共同努力者。固將在彼而不在此。</p>
<p>吾人深信日方不乏明識之士。未嘗不知侵略之非計。徒以慴於一部份人跋扈意志之下。遂至低回咨嗟。不敢有所主張。而此跋扈意志之造成。則以過去非法攫奪之順利。遂謂今𢓭必能予取而予求。不悟時日推移。情況已殊。事至忍無可忍。勢必同歸於盡。故吾人在今日必須明白表示堅决之態度。絲毫不能再有所退讓。以犧牲一切之精伸。作孤注一擲之準備。俾兒玉等以此宣示於其國內。而喚醒彼方一貫侵略者之迷夢。於全副武裝中求和平。於堅强意志下維交誼。如此方期漸次踏上改善兩國關係之正途。如此方能促進雙方親仁善隣之實現。</p>
<h3>英下院再討論華北走私</h3>
<p>［倫敦］英直院中二月之內、中國北部走私事件曾兩次提出討論、今日下院外次克蘭彼於答復保守黨議員斯邁爾斯質問時稱、日本政府對於華北走私事件、已屢由英大使促其注意、並謂救濟之群細辦法、最好由關係當局自行處置之、而最要之點、卽在中國之緝私人員、須有積極行使其職權之自由、此點已由英駐日大使再三向日政府聲述云、（中央社十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>日對海軍限制堅持質量並重</h3>
<p>無意參加砲位口徑條約　英準備造五萬噸主力艦</p>
<p>［東京］日政府曾拒絕參加一九三六年成立之新倫敦條約、然英政府擬請日本參加决定為該絛約骨子之限制主力艦備砲為十四英寸口徑之質的條項、而與日本進行交涉、日政府因四月一日之答覆期間漸次迫近、愼重研究之結果、决定於日內向英政府發出回答、日政府認祇有質的限制而無量的限制之協定、達反軍縮精神、故其答覆內容、似表示拒絕參加限制備砲條約、按新倫敦條約規定華盛頓簽字國中如有一國不參加、則主力艦（三萬五千噸）之備砲口徑十四英寸、可擴大至十六英寸、故英美法意等以日本之不參加、將必抓强其主力艦、且祝他國造艦計劃如何、得發動自動梯條件、建造備有超過十六英寸巨砲之主力艦、由此觀之、新倫敦條約不過規定各國造艦計劃之互相通告、而失其軍縮條約之本性、（十六日同盟電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國海軍界因日政府决議拒絕大砲口徑最大以十四吋為限之議、大為失望、今皆預料英國將建造五萬噸之戰艦－艘、英國海軍要人初望日內閣之最近變動、其所持之態度、當較一九三五年倫敎海軍會議日代表團所表示者為和緩、而不料其竟始終堅持不變也、聞法義兩國皆歡迎大砲十四吋口徑之限制、蘇德兩國亦頗願贊同此議、而靜待日本之决議、以定可否、美國自始卽不願接受此議、今日本旣宣布反對、衆意本年七月間美國行將開造之戰艦兩艘、必將安置十六吋口徑之大砲、美國深信三萬五千噸之軍艦亦能裝十六吋大砲、而無庸犧性其艦身之護甲、惟英。海軍專家就羅特萊式與胡德式兩種軍艦所得經驗評斷、力持異議、職是之故、英國戰驢之增高噸位、恐終難避免也、（中央社十七日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］頃悉蘇聯現方要求英國召集海軍會議、俾未簽訂倫敦海約（卽一九三六年三月二十五日英法美三國所訂立者）各海軍國、得以成立協定、按自倫敦海約成立之後、英國卽與蘇德兩國、暨斯堪的那維亞半鳥各國、分別談判、以冀成立雙方協定、而使各該國接受倫數海約所載質的限制辦法、談話結果、已與蘇德兩國在原則上成立協定、現仍主張與各海軍國、分別進行談話、而認蘇聯所提議之程序殊不適宜、并擬婉勸該國放棄此議云、（中央社十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯文化界大聲疾呼</h3>

<h3>英國前外相奧斯丁張伯倫逝世</h3>
<p>患心臟症醫藥罔效享年七十四　生前致力歐洲和平以親法著稱</p>
<p>［倫敦］英下院保守黨議員奧斯丁張伯倫爵士、今日下午六時以心臟病卒於倫敦私邸、享年七十四歲、臥病不過數日云、查奧斯丁張伯倫、生於一八六三年、卒業於劍橋大學、首以東烏塞斯脫郡代表入下院為議員、其父歿後、卽繼其父為西伯明罕之代表、曾歷任海部民政大臣•財部財務秘書•郵務大臣等要職、自一九○三年至一九○五年任財政大臣、一九一九年復重任該職、一九一五年至一九一七年混合內閣成立、曾任印度事務大臣、包爾溫內閣中、彼任外相、一九二五年復以促成羅卡諾條約之功、受英皇最高動章、並曾一度為掌爾大臣、</p>
<p>奧斯丁張伯倫之父、亦為大政治家、人多以父子並稱之、惟奧父以手腕堅强、富有活動力見稱、而奧則謙遜自抑、靜穆懷、為異於乃父、幼時以生於縉紳之家、動止言行，卽現莊嚴肅穆之態度，卽與諸同學、亦謹飭自持、不茍言笑、</p>
<p>奧斯丁張伯倫、眞實之政治生涯、開始於一九❍○三年被任財政大臣之時、一九一二年保守黨領袖巴爾福勢衰時、奧斯丁頗有升任領袖之望、但阻於華德郎、而領袖地位終為旁納勞所得、說者謂奧斯丁之生於閥閱、是其幸、亦卽其不幸、蓋好膚淺之論者、每謂奧藉父陰而貴、實則奧自有某天才、卽不藉其父力亦可自成為大政治家、但奧無政治之野心、人謂彼僅可為循吏謹飭服務有大臣風度、而無政治建設之特才云、</p>
<p>奧斯丁為有力之行政家、多才善辯、近十年保守黨居於反政府地位時、奧在議院之勢力、益見膨脹、晚年尤見雄辯無敵、生平無至友、但以和善可親、為僚屬所愛戴歐戰之後、、對於歐洲之和平、尤為致力、以親法見稱、人有謂奧斯丁之愛法國、如男子之愛婦人者、但奧則自謂英法之親善、係眞實和平之基礎、而非惑於婦人而忘却對於他人一視同仁之義務云、</p>
<p>日內瓦協定失敗之後、奧斯丁卽圖建築和平於另一基礎之上、使德與戰前諸敵國互結絛約、維持西歐局面、而東歐邊界、則不得以攻戰之方法加變易、一九二五年羅卡諾條約成立、德法比三國相約不相攻戰，而英意則居條約担保者之地位、德復與波蘭捷克二國相約、維持東邊之和平、並由奧氏之斡旋、德加入國聯為會員國、事後英皇以奧斯丁維獲和平之功、獎以最高動章、是年奧氏復與美副總統道斯氏、同膺諧貝爾和平獎金之榮譽、（中央社十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>靑島全市發生水慌</h3>
<p>市府急謀救濟辦法　並已確定治本步驟</p>
<p>靑島通訊、靑市近因久旱不雨以致水源涸竭、全市飲料、已感供不應求，若長此以往、必成嚴重問題、市長沈鴻烈日前除令飭自來水廠及水源地速謀緊急補救外、並往水源地視察最近雨日、水源益感缺乏、市民大起恐慌、沈復於十三日下午一時許、偕同自來水廠長孫斌、及該廠工程主任王昭臣、前赴各水源地視察、以謀神救辦法、頃據沈談稱“歷年•此時期、雨量向不充足、而本年則乾旱特甚、此為三十年來所未有之現象、本市各水源地之水位、自日形下降以來、乃年來本市人口轉而激增、工廠加多、全市每日用水、約在一萬五千噸左右、市府方面、旱有通盤計畫、故日來飲水之暫感不足、不難根本解决、目前之救濟辦法、不外開源節流、開源辦法、卽區增加水源之量、現在除各地水源地之汽機開用外、並在李村河水廠上流張村河、進行鑒并工程、此處工程、大約在十四日後卽可完工、每日可供水量一千五百噸左右、西流莊之開并工程、亦正積極進行、約十餘日後、卽可完工每日司供給水量、千噸之譜、黃埠至白沙河水源地、今日亦將典工明日雖屬星期休假日、仍須招工進行、預計在四月初旬、卽可完工、該處水量、較其他兩處為多·每日可供水量約五千噸、查近日本市不足水量、約千噸上下以上三處工程完成後本市飲水當無不足之虞、到節流辦法、現已由主管機關與各工廠商議、盡量節用、同時亦希望用戶、不浪費飲水亦與節流、有所補益也</p>
<p>關於水慌原因、據自來水廠負責人談、“自上年七月杪曾降大雨一次後、迄今時逾八閱月、未降大雨以故水源涸竭、頓成恐慌、在昔每日出水量、平均為一萬七千餘噸今則僅有一萬五千餘噸、較之往昔已差兩千餘噸、此為致成水慌之主要原因、又近年以來本市大規模之工廠日漸擴充、而新設者為數亦夥、以現時計算、市區中之大工廠、如鈴木•公大•豐田•同與•華新•等二十餘廠、其所用水量、約佔全市用水總量百分之五十、此亦水慌原因之、餘如用戶之繼續加多、消費量之日益遞增、亦有用當之關係、</p>
<p>至於救濟辦法、出現已决定、㊀本市水源地原有李村東西兩廠、海泊河•白沙河：及馬塲等五處、業已盡量設法儲水、以應急需、井在西流莊張村河等處、搜集水流鑿井救急、此項工程數日內卽可完成、此兩處約可日出水量三千五百餘噸、卽能補救目前之不足，㊁本市消費水量、以各大工廠為最多、巳由社會局、自來水廠、召集各工廠負責人、共商救濟辦法、自卽日起、一律•可能範圍內、盡量節用、㊂卽日起、凡由本港開往大連之輪船、概不得在市內裝水、㊃自來水廠方面、除令市內水拴全部開放、日用均可目由汲取外、并通告市民均須極力節用、故勿有所濫費</p>
<p>本市自來水廠、因現有水源地之水量、對於全市供給頗感不足、原擬在月子口築壩蓄水以為洽本計劃、但以此項築壩計晝、全部工程費、約需六百餘萬元、欵額較巨、一時財力實有不及、特擬定分步進行辦法、第一步、先在與月子口相近之黃埠地鑒井設廠由黃埠設送水塔、管通至四方北嶺在北嶺設貯水池、以贅分配水量、統計此項計晝、㊀鎜井四十口、㊁河內吸水管五千公尺、㊂建築辦公室宿舍一處、四升水機三台反水表等各種設備、㊄添送水管六五○公厘口經水管兩萬公尺、㊅貯水池一座、㊆配水管計湛山三千公尺、台東鎮五千公尺、四方危險工業區四千公尺、滄口三千公尺以上各項、共需欸二百萬餘元、此項工程完成後、約可每日增送水量一萬噸以上、將來第二步築壩工程完成後、則每日又可增加水量萬餘噸</p>

<h3>暗殺唐有壬案續審兩被告均翻供</h3>
<p>前此供認謂係刑求　案情仍待調查再訊</p>

<p>提起公訴</p>
<p>經前任特二院刑庭長王綱煦君庭調時、兩犯均供認殺唐不諱、迫後任庭長廖𡎑迭次開庭研訊、因被告等已改押看守所、故提訊時一致推翻前供、否認暗殺、奉諭押候調查再訊各情、已屢誌前報昨日上午十時、山特二院刑庭長廖𡎑蒞刑一庭續訊、飭提兩被告至案、宣告</p>
<p>更新審理</p>
<p>先訊兩被告年籍後、由警務處律師顧守熙陳述案情、與起訴法條後訊問劉振南如何認識楊又生、答、我前因犯案被會審公堂判刑五年、至二十四年、經鈞院加判刑二月、在監獄內與楊又生認識楊為偽造文書案利刑入獄我於四月十六日刑滿出獄楊於五月一日出獄後函約我至貝勒路均益里</p>

<p>至前年一月二日、又應楊約赴香港、始終沒有商量過暗殺唐有壬之事、問、你在公安局•法捕房•與本院庭上、原供認如何計劃、如何開槍、將唐打死、盼得很明白、現•為何狡賴、答、以前在公安局•法捕房•皆已受過重刑、後在庭上供承、恐怕還押捕房、再吃苦頭、故依照公安局及捕房人員做的供單承認</p>
<p>但求速死</p>
<p>其實實在冤枉的、請求庭長明覽、總訊裘積玉、亦極口呼冤翻供否認、末訊甘邨司閣捕、斃供那天出事時、僅聞槍聲、兇手穿大衣棉袍、祇免背影、都向南而荒地奔逃等語訊至此、庭上以案情尚有詳細調查必要、諭知改期四月十四日再訊、被告等仍還押</p>

<p>五十塊錢</p>
<p>交給我、先付一半、送到烏鎭路橋堍北茶館內交欵、後來直到三月七日上午、見陶已被人用斧砍死才知道必定是託的這個人、但不知他的姓名、亦不曉得住在何處、找自陶死後、就不敢回家、呌我表叔劉恒三拿了二十塊錢、又呌沈應考陪到南京、因為南京不認識、盧二（卽小揚州）稱、死者陶文海等、皆係淮</p>

<p>糖為人生日用必需品、其消費量之多寡、恒以民族之進展為正比例據世界糖業統計、美國每人年消糖四十八公斤、英國每人年消糖四十九公斤、法德兩國各二十六公斤、日本十三公斤、中國都市人民與鄉村庶衆消糖數量、相差過遠、其每人每年平均統計、雖不得詳、但卽以最少額五公斤平均計算、則四萬萬人口、年應消糖二千萬公擔、（每公擔合一百公斤、而中國每年自產之糖、據最近去年統計、亦只有六百七十萬公擔、故中國嗣後每年仰給外糖之量、至少當有一千三百萬公擔、值國幣二萬八千六百餘萬元、凡此鉅大之貿易、實為世界產糖國家、——連問日本在內——之所逐鹿、而日木密邇中國、路程卽近、運費又廉、其精糖身棉砂細之貨、又夙為中國普通民衆所嗜、故在理論上言、日木糖在中國之銷路、其地位應較他國為優越、此應先請君等留意者也、</p>
<p>然據去年中國海關統計、進口之糖、僅合一百五十八萬五千公擔有零、（不及民國十八年五分之一）其中由日本輸入者、為五十六萬餘公擔、僅佔全額一分之一、而據吾人所知、丟年由大連運入華北之私糖、實達一百萬零零八千五百一千袋、折合約為八十九萬餘公擔、惟因其係用走私方法、公開運入、遂使海關統計、無法列算、然中國此項關稅損失、則已達八百七十餘萬金單位、合國幣約二千萬元、其由臺灣運人華南之私糖、尚不在內、夫營運私糖、係以毀法蔑信、卑劣不正當之手段、直　　榨取吾儕正當產銷糖商之利益、固應為吾兩國糖商所宜合力剷除者、吾中國全體糖商、旣已合詞籲吾政府、嚴定緝私法令、懇採嚴密方法、以杜私糖之蔓延、而貴國浪人、乃時聳動有力者助長其氣熖、甚至干涉緝私、殺人越貨、事例彰彰、君等團體組織、夙稱備、乃竟漠無一言、坐視正當信譽、蒙國際之點污、而己身應得利益、亦因而剝蝕殆盡、此吾華糖商所為君等深惜、而欲掬誠奉請注意者也、</p>
<p>中國糖關稅之稅率、雖較其他進口貨品略高、然亦萬不足為營運私糖者之藉口、以吾華商所知、據責國昭和十年糖業年鑑、載一九三五年期貴國所產糖數量（含朝鮮•北海道•臺灣•南洋委任統治地在內、）為一千八百三十五萬一千餘擔、而－九三五年貴國全國（含各屬地）渭費之糖、則為一千七百七十七萬二千餘擔、加於是年銷於吾國東四省者一百二十七萬餘擔、合𠆻參證觀之、是貴國不特無過剩糖產、足銷吾華、且已求過於供、則吾華糖稅之高低、而君等更有何關係、藉日、君等可由爪哇一帶轉運營銷、然吾國現行之糖關稅率、若以各國為例、則高於吾者、尚居十之八九、意•波•捷•匈•荷•德•皆其明證、（意波糖稅較中國高六七倍、捷匈荷德亦均高三培而强、）卽就貴國而論、每公擔正稅日金七元四角、加附加稅二元五角九分、消費稅九元五角、共為日金十九元四角九分、亦未較吾國為輕、何獨舉以相責、且進口稅率之制定、卽一國貿易盛衰所關、亦一國主權所緊、君等此來、卽以尊重主權相號召、且聞欲於平等互惠之基、樹民間經濟之益、當必不至不顧事理、漫為减低糖稅之主張也、</p>
<p>抑自十九世紀產業革命以還、無論何國、皆利用關稅之壁壘、以保障本國之工業、卽在貴國亦復皆善、吾中國不幸、受不平等條約八十年之束縛、以至於產業落後、自關稅自主以來、國產事業始有進步、君等旣明知浪人走私之應制止、若反利用走私、向吾政府為减稅之要狹、則君等須知、此事關係吾儕商人全體生死、吾人勢心臚陳糖稅輕重與貴國糖產無干、及减稅足以斬絕吾華新生事業之理由、昭告吾國人、上𥸤吾政府、必不使君等受浪人之貽、忍令同種同文親若兄弟之隣邦、長囿於產業不振之境域也、</p>
<p>夫糖之為利甚簿、君等所深知也、自走私以來、吾儕止當糖商、終歲胼胝手足、而猶不足一飽、此種困苦、誰實厲階、至彼不肖華商、雖曾與貴國浪人勾結營私、然告密一發、生命隨之、近月北方一帶、因此傾家喪生者、吾儕調查所及、已達二百餘人、此二百餘人者、本皆正當糖商第因走私日盛、正當業務不足與爭、遂不得巳為此生命孤注之一擲、其罪固無可逭、然其家屬矛孫、追原禍始、莫不飮泣怨恨、爭與貴國浪人為仇、君等遂亦無端橫遭白眼、影響所至、對於貴國其他商品、亦種惡因、此種心理、設一蔓延、貴國在華高業、𪧟有立足之地、故僅就糖事不端而論、走私之足害吾兩國貿易、及其國民情感者、已如是其鉅，矧今之走私、尚不僅食糖而已、君等亦可一深長思矣、</p>
<p>中國本為世界最大顧主、食糖尤非例外、設君等翻然澈悟、以君等己身及貴國在華商務全體之利害、歸告君之政府、對於營運私糖之浪人、切實制止、更要求貴國駐華它𡫇、對吾海關之緝私、切實協助、則吾儕——全國產銷糖商——感君等盛意、亦必一致糾合、盡其能力、掃除君等過去之蒙垢、且尤為君等之輸華糖業、謀極大之正當出路、</p>
<p>吾儕秉等之頃、已以此極大之願望、準備與君等討議切實而且有益於君等正當貿易之方案、諸君為工高界先進領袖、旣皆不遠千里而來、必將有利吾國、且諸君手創事業、類會輔佐維新、躬歷自力更生之艱難、親味經濟建設之困苦、則凡吾同人今日所堅忍奮　、而邁進於自力更生之途者、將尤必為諸君之所洞切領味、倍予同情、此吾儕之所以不憚爾縷欲為諸君道者、窮諸君平情斷察、勿虛此行、凡茲提携東方國民澈庭、親愛繁榮貿易之徵誠、固深望君等能為同聲之相應也、謹告、</p>

<h3>現代政治與中國（續）</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>復次，我們再來比較地觀察，我們就知道：同為君主政治下的羣治政治領袖政治，也各有其不同之處：同為民主政治正反羣治政治領袖政治，亦同有區別。比如英國同日本，都是君主政治下的羣治政治，但英國以政黨為中心，是政黨政治，多黨政治；而日本則以軍部為中心，頗有一黨政治的趨勢。至於君主政治下的領袖政治，因為只有意大利一個國家，沒有比較，此地不用談，再看民主政治下面，法國的羣治政治和美國的羣治政治又不同，美為民主集權，法則為民主分權。民主政治下的領袖政治，俄德兩國間又有極大區別，（俄為蘇維埃聯邦共和國，自己承認是民主國家）如德國為民主政治下的領袖獨裁，俄國則為個人專制；俄為一階級壓迫其他階級，德則以各階級聯合對外，精神實質完全不同。因此，今天的政治有兩大分野：一個是君主立憲下的羣治政治或領袖政治；一個是民主共和下的羣治政治或領袖政治；而這兩種形態下實質又各不相同。這一點，是我們研究今天政治眞相所必須注意的。（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗銷不爲不暢</p>
<p>標紗欲進反退</p>
<p>五福牧羊廉價套出</p>
<p>收貨空氣又將消散</p>
<p>紗市自前日狂漲後、昨則又趨平静、現紗交易、仍屬活潑、客帮採辦接踵而來、四川·內地·天津·廣東等帮購買尤殷、不過售價未見上漲、故人　　定、且市塲傳言本月份價如在四十元外、某某兩君將無意收貨、同時盛傳怡和廠開出二十支五福牧羊紗四五千包、售價益廉市氣乃愈挫矣、</p>
<p>本月紗獨跌一元七</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月呈參差不一、但美棉仍堅、惟大阪三品紗回跌一元外、二盤本月跌破四十元關口、據市塲傳言、某某兩君之多頭、已大量出籠、且有翻空之傳説、遠期隨之下降、迨至三收盤、聞現紗生意依然活潑、各方買去仍在二千包左右、於是空頭抵補、市盤轉趨高翔、標紗結果、本月　　日收盤價跌五角、其餘勿動、午後開盤、市情和疲、因三品紗市回小、市傳英廠有開出　福牧羊紗五千包、價格特廉、又有套出消息、賣氣驟盛、二盤本月又破四十元關、遠月帶疲、但現紗成交仍在四千包左右、標紗結果各月比下午收盤價跌六·七·八角至一元查賣出同孚一千四百五十包、長餘九百五十包、恒益一千零五十包、大豐一千六百五十包、益記一千二百包、泰興一千二百五十包、元一二千零五十包、大昌成三千包、長豐三千零五十包、大昶二千　百包、生源一千零五十包、恊成一千包、買進裕大七千五百包、達記一千包、愼昌二千六百包、申大一千二百包、愼記一千九百包、潤康一千零五十包、同和二千六百包、泰昌一千五百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現紗客銷四千包關</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各帮買去統計三千九百六十三包、售價堅穩、各帮買額列下、</p>
<p>獲利多頭紛起了結</p>
<p>棉花漲風稍挫</p>
<p>棉市因上日漲風未免太暴、引起一部份多頭了結、故形勢轉趨平澹、但美棉依然邁歩前進、現貨價已至一角五分、印棉漲風更熾、遠月又見新高價、穿出六元關外、午後獲利者了結、遠期微見回挫矣、</p>
<p>六月一度出六元關</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月下落、因上日漲風未免劇烈、引起多頭了結、但美棉續漲、現貨價已至一角五分、印棉漲勢亦熾、二盤以後、市塲傳言、日本經濟團抵華、對於棉花有出口裝運他國之説、於是買勢愈强、收盤各月又見高價、六月期穿出六元關外、標花結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一·二角、午後開盤市情轉趨平疲、以紗市不靈、多頭又來了結、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌五分至二角半、查賣出大豐七千七百擔、同和三千三百擔、大昶四千五百擔、泰興四千擔、通記六千九百擔、賡豐四千八百擔、愼昌二千八百擔、大昌成四千七百擔、恊成五千一百擔、新昶四千六百擔、長和四千八百擔、恒昌二千一百擔、福康二千三百擔、豐壽四千二百擔、買進錦昌一萬二千八百擔、裕大二千四百擔、吉豐二千擔、恒益八千一百擔、達記五千三百擔、合興八千二百擔、泰昌六千六百擔、潤康二千五百擔、信誠二千二百擔、</p>
<p>棉花消費尚屬可觀</p>
<p>現棉消費尚稱不薄、各廠成交比上日似覺較少、來源仍無云、</p>
<p>美棉已到一角五分</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况活動、價因同業及外商買進、各月跌一磅音至漲四磅音、旋以多頭獲利了結及本地人心恐有反動、市價回疲、將近收盤、同業及大衆再度買進、套賣不多、市勢又昂、三月期交割通知單四十三紙、立有受主、布市堅定、但交易較静、收盤極堅、計現貨漲十五磅音、期貨漲九至二十磅音、英棉現貨漲四點、期貨跌一點、印棉空户抵補、日商利物浦及期貨商大批買進、後因利物浦消息不佳及多頭了結而回、計平果爾漲三·七五羅比、奥姆辣漲三至四羅比、白羅溪漲三·七五至四羅比、原電錄左（十六日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十七日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百五十羅比、漲二·二五羅比、奥姆辣爲二百三十六羅比半、平果爾爲一百九十九羅比二五、均漲二羅比、</p>
<p>國內外紗花疋頭升降不一</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>本月期粉慘跌</p>
<p>皆爲現貨去路呆滯</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份初平繼則近期暴落、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲二三角、坎拿大漲三四六角不等、當開價後、以洋麥連漲、人心當然可穩、故本月份開價、尚在九角二分之間、不過本月份之多頭、已呈積重難返之勢、以籌碼甚多、了結需時、一方面之空頭、則廠方居大部分、實銷不動、抵補自然不暢、是以開價之後、即歩歩慘落、至收盤小至八角八分二厘半、四月份則帶小三四分、七八月份小二三分、迨至下午開盤、人心更虚、本月份最低跌至八角半、後幸廠方齊補、人心稍穩、較最低回好二分、四月份因出户亦狂、最小亦至八角八分二厘半、七八月份、因多頭拉進、亦稍回振、觀本月份之慘跌無已實係現貨去路呆滯、籌碼未免過剩、所以多頭無力抗禦云、</p>
<p>新麥尚能支持不動</p>
<p>近期現麥價俱回小</p>
<p>昨期麥市面以洋麥報價、又好二三角至四六角不等、開價時本月份因又近交割、粉市既在極度不振之時、人心自然虚寂、交易既少、價亦鋭落、開收二盤、均爲六元三角半、四月份亦小至三角四五分、六月份以下、大致平穩、迨至下午開盤、因散户多頭、仍有大批出檔、祇津帮多頭、尚無動静、致喊價又落二三分、新麥市面、則仍穩定、現麥市面、又見逐小、各檔又喊落三四分、開懷安麥六元三角四分、江北麥六元三角三分、次二角八分、紹興麥六元一角五六分、天台麥六元二角二分、崇明麥六元一角半、由申大福新各辦一千五百包云、</p>
<p>河米前市價頗堅挺</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到四十餘號、貨約八千一二百石、晨初因前夜大風、到船無幾、故人心頗堅、售方喚聲頗高、但至近午所阻各船絡繹抵埠、形勢頓轉平定、如厚粳行情僅好起五分、薄稻則因本稍平常、包胃雖有南北洋兩帮動辦、但爲數僅一千五六百包、故市况仍難見秀、杜洋尖及陰元悉無軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來船十五六號、市上各貨去路頗旺、客方因河下存船稀少、來源日少、致白粳高貨堅挺、中次轉緊數分至一角、薄稻烟津及西安帮動辦、本街去化亦動、價形挺秀、早稻價亦緊扣、羊杜埠尖並有起色、客尖定勢、白元及其餘各貨、價均平定、</p>
<p>粤帮重起采辦客糙</p>
<p>昨前客秈到頭仍旺、日有萬餘包、惟粤帮昨胃轉活、計又辦去糙機各米近二萬包、粤化既動、人心又復向上、貨主亦不肯輕易賤脱、糙米爲粤帮貪辦、價乃立漲一角、機米亦漲五分至近角、如今明粤化再活、市面或須再度上砌、全日開出江西米一萬八千二百五十包、湘米一千二百五十包、沙漢糙米三千包、南陵糙一千二百包、</p>
<p>標準油豆餅無大出入　　標準油豆餅、連日市面盤旋不一、惟出入均微、標凖豆油祗有五分至一二角之升降、豆餅祇數厘與一分左右之出入、黄豆亦祗一二三分之高低、邇日黄豆豆餅實銷均滯、客囤大半觀望、標油雖有了結與抵補之活動、然新交易亦未活潑、照滬上現貨而論、標準均須回削、惟大連市氣甚堅、前昨來電繼續上展、因此行號出意甚懈、市面尚能站住、昨日標油近平遠站、各有五分之升降、豆餅客囤兩滯、小去半分至一分、標豆無大出入、</p>
<p>常州溥利廠餅上市</p>
<p>昨日油餅市塲中多一榨油廠上市、乃爲常州溥利榨油廠委託長義恒行經理、聞該廠向來專做九斤小豆餅、行銷內河各鄉、今庚突然擴大營業、至本市爭銷南洋去路、昨日市塲中已有樣餅陳列、其正牌餅牌號爲「常州溥利」印、三牌爲「溥利」、四牌爲「肥字」、五牌爲「禾字」、斤量仿照本埠各廠餅一樣、樣餅出品照業內人稱尚街、惟該廠設於內地、對於裝運延時、將後在市價上不免軋别、昨日豆餅市因銷塲轉淡、人心平庸、行情尚撑持原盤、但去路統市交易連行販回出之貨、祇有二千五百片成交、故前途趨勢恐難樂觀云、</p>
<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>公債交易稍活潑</p>
<p>九六已回復曩日市價</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市况比較堅穩、大户賣出、雖尚未絶、吃户胃納漸旺、以中央銀行改組爲凖備銀行、行將實現、各銀行凖備提高、公債需要、將有鉅額之吸收、故本月份多頭極爲安定、前途市况、當可稍形活潑、九六已回復水平綫、仍當趨入平穩、昨日經過、全局雖仍係起伏無定之狀况、默察趨勢、已見稍堅、祇五十四號賣出遠期甲種、連接三盤、計有數十萬、收盤已止、因此散户多頭、亦隨之出脱者甚多、空方尚在堅持、按甲種於最近數月、醖釀無神、刻下五十四號售賣已罄、不久將來、當有反動、市况結果、多數漲五分一角至一角半、少數亦小五分一角、甲種又小一角、九六又退去二角、成交總數、共計五百三十四萬五千元、兹將其漲跌結果、比較列表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>標金仍遭賣方壓廹</p>
<p>金市昨初以海外銀市英美俱升、倫敦生金漲半便士、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、海關金單位漲二厘、標凖標金價掛牌升爲一一五七元四角、晨開反低、開後缺乏供給、突被拉上、現貨號趁高供給、午刻仍遭賣氣所廹、趨勢恐難振作、良以缺乏開現刺激也、今將半天市况誌後、</p>

<h3>所得税申報表類之編製法（十）</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>（四）第二類薪給報酬所得額扣繳用報告表（附淸單）（續）</p>
<p>（五）本月應得額，本月所得實額，本月應得額者，本月應得薪給報酬之定額也。凡本類所得之以每季，每半年，每一年，或每一月計者，均可算出其本月應得額，記入本淸單。以星期計者，四星期作一個月。短工工資之所得，及件工工資之所得，亦應先記入其本月應得額。本月所得實額者，本月份薪　　酬實際支付之額也。凡薪　報酬之折扣發給者，或　借支方式先支一部份者，或因請假關係，减發若干者，　因星期工及夜工關係，獲得升上，加發若干者。其所得實額，往往與　得之定額不同。故本月所得實額欄，應照實際支付之額記明之。此欄之總計，自須與費用　簿內之本月份薪給報酬支付總額相對照。依施行細則第十六條之規定、本類所得之範圍極廣。凡職業上及工作上得之金錢給與均屬之。又依本類細則第七條之規定，業務上薪給報酬之所得，如爲物品，或有價證劵，以給予時之市價，折合法幣計算之。則本月所得實額欄內，凡勤勞所得，均因以貨幣數量之金額記入之。通常所謂董事夫馬費。職員公記，及各種津貼，無一而非第二類所得。公務員因公支領之費用，在本類須知第四條中。雖規定不屬於薪給報酬之範圍，不予課税。但自由職業者及其他從事各業者，其辦公費津貼，或交際費津貼。不能獲同樣免税之待遇。且依財政部之解釋，普通所支付之房貼飯貼，即雇主給與職工之膳宿津貼，除勞工及低級店員每月薪酬之不及三十元者外、亦須併入薪給報酬所得，記入本月所得實額欄內。收受此種薪給報酬所得之納税義務人，除設有業務所者，得依施行細則第十七條之規定，减除相當之開支，以其餘額爲担税額外，凡本淸單所列之扣繳所得税，均以本月份各種所得之實額爲扣税額。與納税義務人對於該項所得所支配之開支，並無關係。此蓋所得税採用課源者之通例。惟依本類須知第十條之規定，勞工之人身保險費用，得於薪給報酬內减除之。則應於備考欄內註明之，以便在計算應繳所得税額時，可從本月份所得實額內先行扣去。至於所得税暫行條例第二條所列之第二類所得之免納所得税者，則當不列入本月份應得額及本月份實得額內。</p>
<p>（六）應繳所得税額　應繳所得税額應依所得税暫行條例第五條所規定之税率，按本月應得額算出之。本月應得之所得額有大小，其所適用之税率亦有高低。計自每月平均所得三十元課千分之五起。分類累進課税，至税率達千分之二百爲止。凡本月所得實額與本月應得額相同者，税額即根據本月應得額算出之。若本月實得額較本月實得額較本月應得額爲小，則先根據應得額算出一税額。再依實得額相當於應得額之比例，換算其税額，記入應繳所得税額欄內。如本月所得實額大於應得額，似宜逕根據應得額，算出其應繳之所得税納。依本類須知第十條之規定所應扣之勞工人身保險費用。可於本月所得實額內先行扣除，再計算所得税。每一納税義務人，在每一服務期間，即在每一個月內，其所得之種類有多種者，應先合計其所得實額，觀其合計所得相當於本類税率中之某種級數，再算出其應繳之所得税額。例如月薪，夫馬費之支付於同一人者，應合計之，以定其本月所得實繳之總數。</p>
<p>（七）備考　備考欄之設置，本所以備註前開各項以外之事項，以資查考者也，以本淸單而言，關於補税之事情，似可於備考欄內塡報之。但補税之計算，手續極爲複雜。須先列入其已繳之税欵，及算出其已繳税額之本月應得額及本月所得實額。再列入其現在應攤加之所得額，及根據以前及現在所得之合計額所算出之應繳税欵。然後始可算出其每月補税之額，及應補繳税欵之總額。則本淸單之備考地位，似尚不足以資廻廊也。他品以有價證劵或物品折抵薪給報酬時，及本月應得額與本月所得實額相差過巨時，似亦應於備考欄內註　其事由。</p>
<p>以上爲自由職業者及其他從事各業者所得税扣繳淸單之編製法，手續可謂繁雜。至於報告表本身即第二類薪給報酬所得報告表（丙種扣繳用報告表）之編製法，手續極簡，首列月份，扣報繳機關名稱·業務·地址·其所塡報者，與上述淸單中所開列者相同。次列本月份本機關支付薪結報酬總額及本機關扣繳所得税總額。此二個金額，均從淸單最後之總計中過入，其用意在彚報淸單中所列之總數。蓋本類所得税之扣繳報告，詳情已見淸單，本報告表不過再摘錄其總數耳，總數摘齊，即以應納之税額，繳送經收機關取得收據。將其繳欵之年月日及經收機關名稱，收據號數，塡入本報告表。並由扣繳負責人簽名蓋章，註明塡報之年月日。連同淸單，一併送報當地之主管徵收機關。本類所得税之扣繳手續即已完備。故編製之手續言，本類所得税之扣繳，應注重於淸單之內容，報告表之本身，則甚筛單也。</p>

<h3>司馬穰苴</h3>
<p>— 汪榕年</p>
<p>——抗敵禦侮·非法不行——</p>
<p>春秋時代，有一國呌做齊國，這齊國當景公在位的時候，國難非常的嚴重，因爲晋國和燕國同時來侵略，晉國伐阿甄，燕國侵河上。齊國就打發大兵去兩面迎敵，但因兵力單薄連連的打敗仗。晋國和燕國漸漸的向裏侵佔，越廹越近，廹得齊景公也着忙了，他立刻召集羣臣來開會，討論怎樣去抵禦敵人，在會議中有的人没有主張，有的人主張割地停戰，有的人主……最後有一位大臣名呌晏嬰的向齊景公説：「大王若想抵抗齊國，要有一位有能力的大將來領兵，」景公道：「誰能够去担任呢？」景嬰道：「臣知道有一位，他呌做田禳苴，他是田完的後輩，爲人精明强幹。論他的行爲，可以呌人服從；論他的武力，可以打退敵人，」景公聽了這話，立刻就下令，召田禳苴進宫來商議軍事。禳苴接了命令，就趕快的跑到宫中去了，景公對他説道：「我國現在的情形很是不好，跟敵人打仗，屢次因爲兵力單薄打了敗仗，所以把你召來領兵去打封你做爲將軍。」禳苴知道是呌他領兵打仗，忙起來叩謝。景公又詢問了一會攻打的方略。臨出宫的時候，禳苴道：「現在臣有一件事請求大王，景公道：什麽事？請快説！」禳苴道：「臣出身很卑賤，别人都看我不重。我現在了兵權，作了將軍，在軍隊中若是有不服從我的人，我是没有辦法來處理的。我想請大王派一位得大王寵信，並且又被國人尊重的大臣做監軍，這樣人民和軍人便會服從了，」齊景公覺得他所説的有理，於是派莊賈担任這個職位。</p>
<p>禳苴出了宫，就去拜訪莊賈，兩人見面後，談論了一回軍事，最後約定在出發那天正午，在軍營中見面，於是分别了。</p>
<p>時光很快的過去已經到了約定的日子了，禳苴因爲跟莊賈有了約，恐怕晚到，在正午以前，就趕快到軍營中等候着。那時没有鐘表，禳苴特地立了漏壺來測時，（漏壺是古代測時的器具，中成有水，有孔滴水，可借以測時），等候着莊賈。</p>
<p>到了出發那一天，莊賈到各親戚朋友處辭行，各處都備辦酒席來送行，他以爲自己是齊景的寵臣，這時也不要緊，因此就不慌不忙的跟親友們周旋，午時已經過去了，直到太陽西斜，他才辭别了親友，向軍營走去。</p>
<p>禳苴在軍營裏等候莊賈，直到午後，還不見他來，禳苴很生氣，馬上毁了漏壺到軍中對兵士們説了一番勉勵的話，然後再回到帳中等着莊賈，直到天黑才看見莊賈滿不在乎慢慢地走來。禳苴一點也不和他客氣，直問道：「我們不是約定今天正午見面嗎？怎麽你現在才來呢？」莊賈帶笑對禳苴説：「唉，我也願意早來，無奈我的親友都以爲我今天到軍中來，提設酒席來送我，因此我躭誤了功夫，直到現才能來。」禳苴道：「我國現在强鄰逼境，失地很多，因此大王派你我來領兵去打，你要知道，一個人是很輕微的，如果没有國家，失了依托，是没法獨存的，所以誰也該愛國。一個人受命給國家報效的時候，就不該顧及私事了。何况這事已經使大王很焦急，同時百姓們的性命都繫於你的身上嗎？現在你毁壞了軍紀，應當怎樣辦呢？」禳苴不等他答復，便召軍正來，問道：「依着軍法，約後晚來的，應該怎樣辦理？」軍正答道：「應當斬頭。」莊賈聽了這話，害怕的很，就打發人報告景公，請景公趕快派人救。但是這人剛被派走，禳苴便把莊賈斬了，並且派人提着莊賈的頭，到軍營中各處去宣告。將士們看見，臉上都帶着恐懼的説：「我們以後非守法不可。」</p>
<p>過了一會，齊景公打發來救莊賈的使者來了。他怱怱忙忙騎着馬跑進軍營來，一看見了禳苴，就對他宣佈齊王要赦莊賈的命令。禳苴説：「將軍在外邊的時候，可以不接受國君的命令」的。他又轉過來問軍正道：「在軍營中是不許跑馬的，現在大王的使者跑馬進軍營，應當怎樣辦？」軍正答道：「當斬！」使者聽了這話，嚇到縮做一團，求饒的話也不能説出來。禳苴沉思了一會才説：「大王的使者，是不能殺的。」於是就派人殺了跟使者同來的兩個隨從，把使者放回去。禳苴這次又派人提着人頭，到軍營各處去示衆。勸告將士守法。</p>
<p>從此驕兵悍將，都服從軍紀，不敢疏忽。但禳苴不是一味拿軍法嚇人的他也懂得恩威並重，因此他待人也很好，對於兵士的飲食，起居等一切事，都親自去探詢，他並且把將軍所得的資糧拿出來，和兵士門均分着食用，不肯自己獨自的享受，因此兵士們都感激他，願意捐軀報國。甚至身體軟弱的兵，都要求拚命替國家打敵人去。晋國和燕國聽到了這種消息，恐怕打不過齊國，急急的撤兵，等到禳苴的兵到達戰地的時候，敵兵早已退却無踪了，於是禳苴全不費力，便把失地收復回來，他大功告成回來那一天，景公帶着一羣大臣去郊迎他，誇奬了他一番，後來國家任禳苴爲大馬，後人因之就稱他馬禳苴。自此之後，田氏就在齊國佔有很重要的位置了</p>
<h3>模範國民</h3>
<p>— 李素</p>
<p>—國家有事·挺身而出；功成後從容退歸田里—</p>
<p>新星尼沓斯是一位身壯力强的中年以上的人。</p>
<p>他以前曾在羅馬政府裏歷任各種重要職務，屢居高位；全國上下都公認他是一位聰明，正直，能幹的好官。但他退職後並不保留一點點官家的派頭，一切都和最普通的安分的農民一樣。他本來很有一點錢，因他熱心公共事業，花費了不少；最後只剩下離羅馬城不遠的那塊小小的耕地，和一筆僅足維持簡單生活的欵子。他同他太太離開羅馬，回到他們自己的田莊裏度着平民的生活。</p>
<p>朝陽剛露笑臉，新星尼沓斯便抗了鋤頭，揚着子，哼着曲子，愉快地走到田裏去工作。無論處于那一種地位，只有工作能使他快樂，也只有有意義的工作能使他感覺生命的充實和想像將要結成的生命之果，這樣便增加他無限希望和生存的力量，因而更加奮進。他同普通的農民没有異樣，只是多了一點精神上的收獲。他的太太很盡心的主持家務，是一位典型的賢良的妻子。兩夫婦分工合作，很平安和樂地過着日子。雖是小小的園地，已很够供給他們簡單的需要了。</p>
<p>羅馬的老百姓並没忘掉新星尼沓斯是一個聰明公正的君子，雖然他已經不是一個財主。在他的田莊附近住着的窮人，遇有什麽困難或是糾紛，誰不是跑來請教他的？他一點也不嫌麻煩，就是最瑣碎的小事情，他也盡力設法替他們處理，爲他們解决，好像都是他自己的事情。只要他辦得到的，他都樂意帮忙，因爲越多機會給他貢獻自己的心力，他才越感到人類間相互的親切，越覺得自己不是一個廢人。</p>
<p>「這兒是新星尼沓斯的家吧？我是羅馬政府派來的，有點兒事要見見他。」有一天忽然來了一個大兵站在門口問新星尼沓斯的太太。</p>
<p>「對啦，可是他往田裏做工去了。您請等一會兒，我使人去呌他回來。」</p>
<p>新星尼沓斯一聽到説有一個兵帶了政府的重要的召令來，馬上三歩兩脚的奔回家裏。</p>
<p>兵士一看見他就説：</p>
<p>「你好，新星尼沓斯？我到這兒來是以政府的名義請求您馬上到羅馬去。」</p>
<p>「趕快把我的斗蓬拿來，因爲我得馬上就去，不能躭擱！」他對他的妻説。她把衣服拿來了，新星尼沓斯一邊披斗蓬一邊告訴她若是他晚上没有回來也不用發愁。</p>
<p>他和兵士騎了馬向羅馬城飛馳而去。</p>
<p>到了羅馬，新星尼沓斯看見元老院的議官們站了一大羣在等着他來。他在猜想一定有什麽嚴重的事情發生了，連忙從馬背上跳下來，走向人羣中，他們都很熱烈地歡迎他。</p>
<p>新星尼沓斯答禮畢，便説：</p>
<p>「諸位議官，你們派人呌我馬上趕到羅馬，是有什麽驅使麽？」</p>
<p>其中有一位議官代表衆人説：</p>
<p>「唉，新星尼沓斯，羅馬同山上的敵寇開戰你是知道的。他們從山上的巢穴裏下來，向羅馬前進，到處焚掠，殺死我們許多同胞。我們派出一支最勇悍精鋭的軍兵去迎戰，滿以爲總可以把敵人消滅。可是我們昨天在城牆上看見五個人騎着馬奔向羅馬城，能够回來的就只是那五個了。」</p>
<p>「那是怎麽一回事？我們羅馬軍兵竟不能抵禦山賊嗎？」新星尼沓斯問。他心裏又詫異，又焦急。</p>
<p>那位老議官緊鎖着眉頭，悲憤地説：</p>
<p>「回來的那幾個兵士告訴我們説，當我們的軍隊正由山谷小口向着一條狹窄的山徑前進的時候，突然的受到攻擊。他們想繼續前進，但是發現那條路已經給一面堅厚的石牆堵住，牆後還有一支勢力雄厚的敵軍。前無去路，于是他們就只有向後退，可是後路也給敵人用同樣的方法堵塞着，真所謂「進退維谷」了。在這個當兒，我們的士兵給埋伏在小徑兩旁的高山上的敵軍猛烈攻擊。無數大石頭從高處向着我們的人馬滾下來。最後傷亡已經過半，不得不呌十個人冒險衝出戰綫趕回羅馬求救兵。那十個人裏只有五個逃得性命回來。」</p>
<p>「這情形真太嚴重了，」新星尼沓斯説，「你們要我幹點什麽呢？」</p>
<p>「我們請你來，因爲知道羅馬境內，現在再也找不到一個比你更富有應付戰爭與和平的經騐和才能的人物了。請你率領我們所能募集的軍隊前往抗敵。」</p>
<p>新星尼沓斯奉命後，馬上準備進攻的計劃。他吩咐那五個逃回來的兵士小心詳盡地把山嶺區域，戰地形勢，某處是山谷小口，某處是上山窄徑，某處是横梗山路的石牆，都一一繪畫出來。他召集人馬，告訴他們説：</p>
<p>「親愛的弟兄們，我們有一支軍隊被困在前方山谷中，他們在絶境裏仍繼續爲羅馬人民的生存而奮鬥着！希望諸位能帮忙去救那些勇士們出險。你們都願意去麽？」</p>
<p>「願意！願意！這正是我們的責任！」衆口同聲的響應着。</p>
<p>于是新星尼沓斯欣然率領部下，選一條少有人走過的最荒僻險峻的路前進。他們屏息着戰戰兢兢的走，好容易爬上了比敵人所佔的更高的一個峯上，高聲喊殺。那些山賊猛抬頭看見羅馬軍兵在他上面，就立刻驚惶失措，滿山亂竄，各逃性命。許多都被殺死了。其餘在底下山谷中堵塞路口的也紛紛潰退。被困的羅馬兵卒得慶更生，都忘掉了疲乏，歡呼起來。</p>
<p>過了幾天，新舊兩支軍隊集合起來，跟着前導的首領新星尼沓斯回到羅馬城。在那十六天裏，新星尼沓斯是做着全羅馬唯一的偉人。他救了一支羅馬軍隊，又救了羅馬本身。當他脱下頭盔，換掉戰袍的時候，他心裏覺得非常快樂，因爲在他的生命中又多盡了一分國民的天職。他更高興的是這次竟没有戰死，還能活着等機會貢獻他自己，假如國家用得着他的話。</p>
<p>元老院的議官們和羅馬民衆爲了新星尼沓斯這次的功績，都願意推戴他做全羅馬的首領。但是，當他們對他表示愛戴和奉獻這樣榮譽的高位時，他心裏想，現在又不是没有人能統治羅馬，我何必爲一點點應盡的勤勞而居功？我爲國家効力是出于愛護國家，難道希望得高官厚禄麽？所以就堅决地拒絶了，他説：</p>
<p>「諸位同胞的好意，我是非常感激的，但是我生平唯一的願望是回到自己的田莊裏，做一個安分的農夫。想諸位愛我，一定不相强的。」他説完，滿意地一笑，縱身跨上他自己那匹白馬，蹄聲的得，逕自回家去了。</p>
<p>第二天，朝陽剛露笑臉，新星尼沓斯又荷了鋤頭，揚着子，哼着曲子，更愉快地走到田裏去工作。</p>
<h3>吕呵芬克（1632-1723）</h3>
<p>— 伍必雄</p>
<p>（續第四十九期）</p>
<p>—第一位知道有微生物的人—</p>
<p>一七二三年這位埋頭苦幹七十年的科學家告别了世界。那時年已九十一歳了。臨終時他還念念不忘他的事業，請他們老朋友把那最後寫的兩封信，譯成拉丁文，送到倫敦皇家學會去。</p>
<p>第一位發現微生物者的故事就此結束。此後繼續研究微生物的有光芒千丈的大師斯巴倫塞Spallanzanl有千倍那樣富想像力的巴士特Pasleur有同陷害人價的微生物奮鬬而帶給人類明瞭功效的羅勃脱柯赫Robert　Kode；他們的名字和其餘微生獵取者的名字在今日要比吕芬呵克響得多；但是他們之中没有一個像這荷蘭香門人在這樣缺乏方法而尚這樣赤誠，這樣出人意外的凖確，並且没有一個及得上他那健全的理智。他是微生物的開路先鋒！他是一般大名鼎鼎的後繼者的領導！没有了他，微生物學還要遞幾十年才能開始有牼們的歷史。</p>
<p>吕芬呵克的機會來了，原來在他本鄉，有位生物學家名叫格拉夫，他是皇家學會的通信會員，因爲他對於人類的卵巢有獨到的研究。這位生物學家賞識—吕氏的研究，就把他介紹給皇家學會。皇家學會對他那透鏡下的神秘，發生了莫大的驚奇。</p>
<p>許多科學上基本的發現，在後人看來是簡單得不能叫人相信。人類幾千年遇到這些所謂「近在眼前」的東西，却總把它忽略過去。我們對於微生物也是如此。現在難都能用了顯微鏡寫寫意意地欣賞微生物游走和翻觔斗，醫科初年級的學生也能把那可怕的各種疾病的傳播者指給我們看。誰想到吕芬呵克發現這個秘密是歷歷艱苦換來的！他抱着精益求精的態度一而再地製造了幾百個透鏡，他懷着發現新奇的熱忱發狂似的檢視一切。但是這種似乎瘋狂的工作，却是他後來造成那值得紀念的一天的必要凖備！</p>
<p>值得紀念的一天，就是他用微細的玻管吸了一滴雨水而觀察的一天。他在那天所發現的，成爲神話式的事蹟的全部故事的開篇，微生物的學説—細菌學—就是記載這類故事的。吕芬呵克有「觀察狂」；祗有他這樣一個怪人才會想到用他的透鏡去看一件這樣乏味這樣平淡的東西—一滴雨水，成千成萬從天上落下來的雨滴！水中除了水外還會有什麽呢？</p>
<p>他帶了在火熖中抽成細絲似的玻管走入園中，在水缸內吸取了一滴雨水，走回研究室，把細玻管插在顯微鏡的針上……隔了不多一會，他的女兒瑪利亞突然聽到她爸爸興奮的聲調。</p>
<p>「來呀！哈哈！這滴雨水裏有着小生物……它們在游……它們團團運動！它們比我們肉眼能見的任何東西要小上一千倍，……到這兒來看！看！看我發現了什麽！」（完）</p>

<h3>囅然子的拊掌錄</h3>
<p>— 趙景深</p>
<p>囅然子的拊掌錄可以在明陶宗儀的説郛卷三十二刋明陸楫的古今説海申集裏看來。但兩種本子祇有八篇是相同的；説郛本有十六篇是古今説海本所没有的，下面都註出『此條未見』字樣大約刻書者曾取古今説海來校勘過一次吧？古今説海本則有二十六篇是説郛本所没有的，所以兩種本子拚凑起來，一共可以得到整整五十篇笑話。兩種本子的體例也不同，説郛本每篇都另列題目，古今説海本是没有題目的。</p>
<p>這部書也是輯錄的性質。序云：『東萊吕居仁先生作軒渠錄，皆記一時可笑之事。余觀諸家雜説中，亦多有　是者。暇日裒成一集，目之曰拊掌錄。不獨資開卷者之一笑，亦足以補軒渠之遺也。延祐改元立春日囅然子書。』可見此書是「裒」「集」「諸家雜説」的。</p>
<p>四庫全書總目提要以爲『説郛載此書，題爲宋元懷，』便斷定囅然子是宋人元懷的自號。但明本説郛也只書作元□□□，四庫全書總目提要所云，或許是指的淸順治丁亥姚安陶　所編的錯誤百出的本子吧？所以我認爲提要的話是不可靠的。我以爲囅然子該是元朝人，至早不過是宋末元初人，證據有二：一，明本説郛題爲元人所撰。二，自序的年代明書「延祐改元」延祐是元仁宗的第二個年號延祐元年是一二一四年；宋亡於一二七九年，拊掌錄編於宋亡後三十餘年，編者眼見宋元的推移當然是可能的。至於書中宋代事而不書宋，也有一個解釋：因爲宋代事都輯自宋代的筆記，照樣直書，所以便不加宋字，况且身既爲宋遺民，在元代不以爲自己是元人，宋字就更可不寫了。</p>
<p>編者選輯的眼光與謝肇制的五雜俎頗多相同者，例如：説郛本第二篇講論語是五雜俎的第四十四篇，第十六篇置帽僧頭是五雜俎的第一百二十三篇，第十九篇換羊書是五雜俎的第九十三篇，第二十四篇賊詩是五雜俎的第四十九篇。説海本也有三篇是與五雜俎第十六，一百十五，一百廿二等篇相同的。在這相同的七篇中，也許有一部分是五雜俎間接取之於拊掌錄的吧？</p>
<p>拊掌錄第十三篇禽言到了江進之的手裏，却變成雪濤小書的形式而出現了。兹並錄二篇於次，藉以考見笑話的轉變：</p>
<p>王荆公嘗與客飲，喜摘經書中語作禽言令。燕云：『知之爲知之，不知爲不知，是知也。』久之無酬者。劉貢父忽曰：『吾摘句取字可乎？』因作鵓鴣令曰：『沽不沽，沽。』坐客皆笑。（拊掌錄）公冶長解禽言。一時孔子聞鳩啼，曰：『此何云？』答曰，『他道「觚不觚。」』又聞燕語，曰：『此何云？』答曰『他道「知之爲知之，不知爲不知，是知也。」』（雪濤小書）</p>
<p>王荆公，劉貢父一變而爲孔子公冶長，煞是有趣</p>
<h3>「服務與修養」（續第九十六期）</h3>
<p>— 李涵田</p>
<p>體格修養是青年的基本條件，不但自身的問題，實關係於民族事業前途。所謂體格修養，其道亦至淺近，即由平常衣食住運動休暇疾病等與健康之關係，即如何去求達到於健康之域。例如衣之目的質料洗滌式樣等，食之營養成分等，住之地點光綫空氣窗户等，運動之各方面的選擇及其方法，疾病的常識，衛生及傳染病之預防等等，都很重要。</p>
<p>第三爲職業問題職業人生觀，及領袖資格。職業問題如擇業標凖，得業的困難，得業的方式，試工的方法，改業的研究，其失業的過失，其復業的方法，與升遷的要訣，以及成功的研究，都按照職業服務實際情狀，寫述詳盡。</p>
<p>從事職業者，對於職業盡具有人生觀，其首要者，爲做人治事的一貫方法，處處地方，都要記着「什麽」「甚麽」「怎麽」這幾個意念。職業界中的人物如何？命運説對於職業前途之阻難，勞與酬與資間之各異及其相互的關係，由職業本身去發現最樂，而消除其苦痛。世人所謂苦樂大都是假的，因此對於樂的基本條件應特别注意。職業是服務，是在於實地去做，不是只憑口説，臨事頭腦要冷，血要熱，情感要熱，遇事之妥洽與抗爭，都要有分寸，能做到中和的人生。個人主義與非個人主義之於職業界，其根本不同之點何在，職業人生觀之要點，先在知道人生是什麽？人生觀與社會間的變度如何？都要有確切的明瞭。</p>
<p>對於領袖資格各節，所述亦各扼要精賅，如怎麽會做一個領袖？領袖之延攬人物，支配工作，調和意見，設計及主持大綱，應付事變，培養人材等等，確要有獨特的才量，才能勝任，所以領袖的天資學問及其德性，比平常人更要有深切的修養。</p>
<p>上述是本書的一個縮影，不但是職業界青件所賴補習職業技能，也就是研究做人之要道。何淸儒先生介紹本書説：「服務與修養，可算一部青年人生指南……青年如果能依從所指的途徑，適應個人所具的特性，切實遵行，可保證職業上有成功，生活上發生效力，即中年人亦未嘗不可從這書得到相同的利益。」</p>
<p>何先生的話説得很切要。本書當時雖以職業補習學校青年做對象，但實際可爲普通一般人做爲實際之修養公民的教本。本書説理透闢，取材新頴，作者根據平生經騐，參證古今中外各哲言行，用生動的文字，舉列許多關於上述的實際的原則。較之我們去讀那些陳舊空泛的修養之書，實在得益的多，要之此書對於青年之思想生活求知工作各方面，實具有進修利導之功。（完）</p>

<h3>擴軍與毀滅</h3>
<p>— 芳</p>
<p>昨見報載，法國防部長達拉第演說，謂親國際擴張軍備情形，足以證明法國發行國防公債之必要，例如德國自估領萊因河區域以後，卽編練陸軍一百餘萬員名，並創設鐵甲師，備有轟擊坦克車之大炮，其空軍海軍，亦重整旗鼓，規模宏大，意國發展空軍海軍，亦不遺餘力，蘇聯其常備陸軍員額，當在一百三十萬以上，此外還有坦克車數千輛，飛機數千架，其强大之海軍，正在建造中，外如波蘭及小協約各國，對於增强軍備，亦作廣大之努力，瑞士最近徵募國防公債，不及數小時而畢集，卽以英國而論，向以縮減軍備，具最大之熱忱，然至最近，決定於五年內支出一千六百萬萬法郎，以供國防經費之用，云云，自然，一個國家，欲求自立與存在於世界之上，非有龐大的軍事準備不可，尤其是在列强整軍經武，擴張軍備，至白熱度之際，更非擴張軍備，不足以圖存。</p>
<p>但是彼欲擴張軍備，此亦擴張軍備，彼欲收回殖民地，此欲攫取新疆土，於是以共國所有之民力財力物力，一舉而盡犧牲於擴張軍備之中，英結果，弱者固無以自存而毀焉，强者遇更强者而又毀焉，共弱之毀者，非如阿比西尼亞之滅亡，卽為西班牙之內戰，為强鄰作試驗武力之區域，其强之毀者，更十年生聚，十所敎訓，以圖洗滌其國恥，於是弱者其國固不易保，而其强者亦何嘗可保。</p>
<p>或有懼其－國國力之不足以抵抗强鄰，與征服强鄰也，於是倡為集體安全之策，互訂密約，互結同盟，因之弱者恐懼强鄰之侵逼，而互為團結，而强者亦恐為弱者所制，而亦互相團結，雙方團結之力愈堅，則破壞之力亦愈大而愈廣，卽使一方果獲勝矣，而團結之中因利益之不均，彼此之猜忌，又起而內閧焉，則其戰爭之局久變矣，如是則成一殘酷之世界，與恐怖之世界，無論强者與弱者非同歸於盡不止，故擴軍之結果，必至於毀滅，此理固無可遁逃者也。</p>
<p>然而我又為積極擴張軍備者危，現在之所謂擴軍，其主要之戰爭利器，則為飛機大炮坦克車與兵艦，而數者之中，尤以飛機為最殘忍，而最有力之武器，但是現在科學正在發叨，譬如前日德國有死光之發明，以為飛機一遇死光，刖飛機全歸無效，此種利器，大約僅有理想，而當至𠤤正發明時期，所以各國尚以飛機為惟一武器，趕製不遣餘力，萬一𠤤正發明此物，則飛機等於無用，但是現在是科學的世界，有此理想，必能成為事實，故現在的科學家與軍事家，不當於趕製飛機和坦克軍方面着想，應當在如何防制飛機和坦克車等等方面着想，使所謂現代之戰爭利器者，盡歸無用，則世界或有安寧之日。</p>
<h3>不知肉味</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>頃據工部局衛生處的調查，“本年一月份，各項肉類的宰額，均急劇减落，計豬與去年同期比較，减少百分二七。三六，羊减少百份之五四·五六，牛减少百份之一·四○，故屠塲的工作，頗見清閒”云。這件事看來像是很平凡的，然却大可注意呵！問題並不在於肉類銷路停滯本身，嚴重的是，由此反映出來居民生活的現象。</p>
<p>肉類為主要食物之一，家無貧富，多少總是要吃的。食肉的减少，正是說明人民生活的困苦。住在上海，窮人本衆。但從這－事實，使我們明自一般人窮的程度來。至少可以看出居民的生活，今年是比去年更為困難了！</p>
<p>情形大約是如此的，普通人家，日常生活必需品，如柴米油鹽之類，應付原難。肉類難為主要食物，但與菜類比較，不免奢侈些。故大家當生活不易維持，就只好由節儉下手，捨葷而吃素。兩角錢的豬肉，僅夠三四人吃一頓。二百文的青菜，却可勉强過一天。</p>
<p>另一原因，是一年來，市上百物勝貴，致人民的生活程度，隨之增高。據調查所得，去年各種菜類，比前年約漲一倍。而肉類如豬羊牛，也相繼漲價。這一來，居民的生活，便大受影響。許多人連靑菜都吃不起，肉類更不必說！這就使肉類的宰額，急劇减少了。</p>
<p>據說，從前有位皇帝，聞地方鬧荒災，人民不得食物。帝感然憂之，問左右曰，“百姓何不吃肉？”這一問，在不知民情的皇帝想來，是再合理不過的，可謂善作打算，然而我們一聽，却像有意開玩笑似的，未免太覺滑稽！百姓要是有肉好吃，還怕會俄肚不成？</p>
<p>但這只限於窮人而已，闊人是不算的。上海一班老爺少爺，五十元一餐的大菜，也滿不在乎，何況一塊錢三斤多的豬肉？說不定他們連這類的東西，都有些不肯咽下去</p>
<p>好在，據衛生專家說，素食大有益於身體，近來在德國，也發明“肉食有害”（？）的新學理。這樣看來，窮人雖無口福吃肉，對於健康，却是有好處的。那未大家倒可以不必再與“不知肉味”之嘆了！</p>
<p>科學叢話</p>
<h3>貓與狗智慧之比較的研究</h3>
<p>— 晁溪</p>
<p>貓也像狗那樣陪明嗎？這個問題由經驗的判斷，所得的答案是否定的。在許多科學測驗上，也證實狗之智慧較高。可是科學並不是這樣輕信，其理由就是對於貓還沒有一種公平的研究，因為狗是一種羣居的動物，牠愛牠的主人，使主人高興，喜歡被人稱贊，且比貓容易有表現智慧的機會。至於貓，牠的天牲和習慣就是獨居的，對於其主人的態度和稱贊也漠不關心，自然不容易顯見牠的“智慧“了。</p>
<p>最近哥倫比亞大學的心理實驗室，正在考察貓的陪明究達何種程度，研究所用的器械是很巧妙的，卽把貓關在籠中，要牠開門，問題的形式如下：貓能夠開門嗎？若能夠，要嘗試多少次呢？</p>
<p>其方法如下：用三片木質的圓薄版放在地板上，用金屬綫把牠們連繫起來，拉着一個，可以全體發生活動。這樣排列着，若動物能照着適當的程序去踏，便可把食物箱的門打開，例如我們把板佈置起來，飢餓的貓必須先踏着第一板，後踏第二板，再踏第三板，才能得着箱中的牛奶。</p>
<p>克拉克大學的心理學敎授亨特博士，曾做了一種不同的實驗，他的目的是在決定一個動物專注於一種行動計劃，究竟能夠支持多少時間。實驗所用的工具是一間有人口的房子，面前有三個食物箱子。在先是訓練動物，使牠知道箱口處有光時，便是那可以打開的食物箱。到了食物與光的聯結能確實成立以後</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>，真正的試驗便開始了。</p>
<p>此實驗先把光綫放出，動物由鐵絲網中看見光錢，便預備跑到箱子前面尋找食物。但現在却把光滅掉，禁止動物不讓牠跑去，要牠等待一刻，那末，經過多少時間，動物還能記得那發光的箱子呢？據實驗的結果，貓能記憶十六秒至十八秒，而狗能記憶一分鐘至二分鐘之久。</p>
<p>關於貓的聰明，也有許多可靠的可驚的故事。英國倫敦林那學會的動物學秘書博物學家羅曼士曾說有一件故事，據說有一只貓，牠的主人有投碎麺包給鳥的習慣，牠却會躲藏在樹木中，在鳥們吃食的時候，突然躍出攫捉，有一次，麺包的投出，是在黃昏，又為小雪所蓋住，到第二次早晨，牠的主人發現貓已把雪掀開，麺包已移至別地，並將牠放在雪的上面，然後躲在樹林中，等候鳥的來到。</p>
<p>又有一個故事，一只貓的背上偶然被染上了火油，繼而牠因為走近火爐，火星飛在牠背上，卽着了火，牠便立刻奔出屋外，跳入水槽，把火熄滅。</p>
<p>這些例證，假使我們承認可靠，則顯見不但貓有觀察的能力，且有計劃的能力，表現着高等智慧。</p>
<p>至於關於狗的故事，羅曼士曾說有一只狗很恨洗澡，牠的怨恨，後來一天比一天深，後來牠只要一看見僕人拿着水來給牠洗澡，牠就非常狂暴，於是女主人想親自試驗一下。可是她也不能成功，哄騙牠，威嚇牠，打牠，飢餓牠，都不成功。最後：主人決定用“安靜的對付法，”她對牠不理，她散步時，不再携帶牠出去，她坐着讀書或縫衣時，狗跑到她面前，她便把頭回過去。這樣經過了十幾天。最後，有一天早晨，狗來到她面前，表示一種反悔的態度，於是她立刻替牠洗澡，非常的忍受，牠很高興地呌了起來，跳出門去作日常的散步。到第二次洗操時，牠最初很是頑固，但一經主人把頭回過去時，牠立卽跳進了浴盆。</p>
<p>由實驗及故事的證據，都可見狗的智慧要比貓高一些，不過若要作－個公平的比較，應該把狗與貓顯著的相異點研究一下，因此不得不研究牠們的遺傳。狗是從一種羣居的動物（狼）而來，貓則由獨居動物（野貓之類）而來。所以狗的方面，我們應該想到牠根本上就是一種社會動物，牠們攻擊防衛時，都聯結一氣，而奠定了合作的基礎，反之貓是獨居的，牠的特徵是自足，機巧，和計谋。</p>
<p>雖然經過了很久的年代，但老習慣仍存在着，狗追逐牠的獵品時，牠們大聲的狂吠，貓却偷偷地不出聲地走向牠的目的物。又狗在呌食時彷彿和別的狗在競爭，吃得很快，並不細嚼，然貓卻是一個精細的食者，往往很費時間的把牠的捕獲品，玩弄夠了，才殺而食之。</p>
<p>因為狗沒有孤獨的本能和歷史，所以被遺棄時，非常痛苦，牠一找得了牠的主人，牠便忠心地跟隨他，可是貓卻不然，非在相熟的地點。</p>
<p>由此，我們也可知道為什麼狗很服從而有責任的感覺，因為牠是羣居的動物，牠知道什麼合理與不合理，所以牠因錯誤而受責罰，牠仍願依賴牠的主人，而貓則不能接受任何責罰，否則便逃跑。</p>
<p>總之，貓和狗之間的智慧，是沒有相差什麼的。</p>

<h3>關於「生龍活虎」</h3>
<p>徐欣夫接連地拍攝了二部偵探巨片，他這企圖，爲國産電影開闢了一條新的途徑。</p>
<p>本片同樣是繼續着他過去的風格的，但是在取材上，他是更凖確地暴露了現實，以北國漫天的匪燄，偵探們英勇的奮鬥，説出了當前我們應有的某種使命。</p>
<p>他用了非常的苦心，嚴肅的態度，緊張的情緒，快要把本片全部完成了。</p>
<p>在演出上，不但充滿了使人驚心動魄的畫面，在軍匪激戰的一塲，更有着政府軍隊　壯的恊助，各長官親自參與，實在是難能可貴的。</p>
<p>演員，有顧蘭君·梅君姊妹，王徵信·龔稼農·謝雲卿等，都是影壇上素負盛譽的明星，演技的純熟深刻，早有確評，在本片裏，更有着可驚的進展。</p>
<p>觀衆們，這「生龍活虎」將給你一種新的感覺，新的激刺！</p>
<h3>「將軍之女」昨晚獻映</h3>
<p>「將軍之女」昨晚九時一刻，已經在新光大戲院獻映了。</p>
<p>這是黎明時代的歷史的插曲，故事是説一個軍閥在没落前夜的瘋狂，暴戾，殘殺的慘劇。將軍的女兒，有一個同學，（也是她的愛人，）却是一位革命青年。彼此立塲不同，自然難免分裂。但她同情革命，她反對她父親的暴行，雖然父親十分愛她，但她終於背叛了，還拿了一把手槍，含着淚去殺她的父親。</p>
<p>黎灼灼飾將軍之女，無疑是成功了。李淸雖是新人，這裏却給了我們一個驚異的發現。韓蘭根的小兵，真可愛，當他在浴盆子裏裸浴，被軍官發現時的窘態，就是一個哄堂的笑聲。</p>
<p>昨晚該片獻映，不到八點半鐘，新光大戲院已經擠滿了觀衆，臨時因爲客滿退出去的很多，那熱烈的情况，可見觀衆對於聯華影片的愛好。</p>
<p>「將軍之女」的導演賀孟斧，對於電影戲劇的修養都很深湛。這片子的成績的卓越，當然不是没有理由的了。</p>
<h3>民新新聞</h3>
<p>「新人道」外景隊通訊謂：現仍在淸江浦工作，深得天時地利人和之帮助，故所得成績異常滿意。</p>
<p>金擎宇前自南京返滬料理公司事務，因在京尚有未完事務，近又將赴京，須兩禮拜後方能回滬籌備「鬩牆記」開拍事宜。</p>
<p>黎鏗尊人黎民偉，因黎及林楚楚女士在淸江浦拍外景，近亦赴淸江浦探視照料，並參觀拍戲。</p>
<p>蕭英在任彭年導演之「神秘女探」中，被聘飾演警察總監一角，此種莊嚴正派之人物，適合蕭之個性，在「靈肉之門」獲得優良成績，更能爲「神秘女探」生色不少。</p>
<p>鄔麗珠以前主演各片，在南洋方面最爲馳名，故有南洋皇后之稱，此次在「神秘女探」中，演來更勝任愉快。再加以大力士彭飛及硬派明星温容助演，必能得非常成績，以饗觀衆。</p>
<p>將由林楚楚，黎鏗主演之「小紳士」一片，故事雖取自「小伯爵」，但將由卜萬蒼改編，使情節更爲動人云。</p>
<h3>模範兒童劇社擴大徵求社員</h3>
<p>兒童是將來社會的支持者，新的世界的建設者，他們將繼我們來完成我們這一代所没有完成的一切偉業，所以，我們應該重視兒童，更該重視兒童教育。——因爲在兒童時代所接受的一切印象比較强烈和持久，同時「教育」比「再教育」更要容易些。</p>
<p>戲劇是創造新兒童的新工具，也是教育兒童最有力的武器。「模範兒童月刋社」同人有鍳於此，才發起一個「模範兒童劇社」，現在已經籌備就緒，决定在三月二十八日召開正式成立大會，餘興節目有「小偷」與「甲北小景」兩獨幕兒童劇。</p>

<h3>Anniversary Celebration Held by the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council</h3>
<p>Wang, Yan, and Others Attended and Gave Speeches, Encouraging Mongolian Compatriots to Save Themselves; Wang and Yan Flew Back to Shanxi Province Immediately After the Meeting</p>
<p>[Guihua] The anniversary celebration of the establishment of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council was held at 8 a.m. on the 17th in the Public Auditorium. Chairman Sha Wang presided, and Wang Jingwei, Yan Xishan, Zhao Pi'lian, Chu Minyi, Deng Zexi, and others participated. A portrait of Genghis Khan was hung in the auditorium. At the beginning of the meeting, everyone bowed three times to the portrait of the Prime Minister [Sun Yat-sen] and Genghis Khan. First, Sha Wang gave a report. Then, Wang Jingwei, Yan Xishan, Zhao Pi'lian, and Fu Zuoyi delivered speeches successively, which were translated into Mongolian by Wang Qing. Wang encouraged Mongolian compatriots in Suiyuan to strive for self-salvation and to save Outer Mongolia and the Mongolian compatriots in the Eastern League. Yan elaborated on the importance of national self-salvation. Zhao Pi'lian spoke about the achievements of the Mongolian Council in the past year. Fu Zuoyi elaborated in detail on the spirit of unity between Mongolians and Han Chinese in fighting the war. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 a.m. The Mongolian and Han dignitaries who attended the meeting rushed to the airport to see off Wang and Yan. At 11:05 a.m., Yan arrived at the airport and took off at 11:15 a.m. Chu Minyi and Wu Maogong accompanied Wang. Zhao Pi'lian stayed behind to take things slower. Wang Jingguo flew back to Shanxi with Yan. After Wang arrived in Taiyuan, it was decided that he would fly to Nanjing on the 18th. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Wang and Yan, accompanied by Chu Minyi, Wang Maogong, and others, flew back to Taiyuan from Suiyuan at noon today. They were welcomed by all parties as planned. Wang and others got off the plane and went straight to the Shanxi Hotel to rest. Yan returned to the Suiyuan Office. Zhao Pi'lian did not come along because he was in charge of the meeting affairs of the Mongolian Political Council. Chu Minyi and others visited Jinci Temple in the afternoon and were entertained at a banquet at Jia Jingde's private residence in the evening by Zhao Daiwen, Jia Jingde, Yang Aiyuan, Zhu Huanguang, and others. Wang did not participate due to illness. Wang held a tea party for reporters from various newspapers inside and outside the province at the hotel at 5 p.m., talking for about half an hour. Then, he went to the Suiyuan Office to visit Yan for a long conversation. It is said that they had close consultations on issues such as saving the country from disaster. Wang will still take the original plane with Chu, Wang, Lin, and others to Nanjing tomorrow. The main points of Wang's conversation with the reporters are as follows: (1) Regarding the Sino-Japanese issue, recently, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has repeatedly expressed its views, and the visit of the economic inspection group to China has led to renewed talk of economic cooperation between the two countries. This is what our people desire. However, the various things that have happened in the past are deeply imprinted on the minds of the people and are not easily forgotten. We are determined to act in accordance with the declaration of the Third Plenary Session, and we are always prepared for sacrifice. (2) Regarding the issue of the surrender of the Communist Party, if the Communist Party can follow the orders and resolutions of the Central Government, it can be given a path to self-renewal. This is not tolerating communism, but at a time of national resistance against Japan, the whole people should fight together under the leadership of one goal. (3) Chairman Chiang is recovering his health, although he still needs to rest temporarily, but all major policies still need to be handled by him personally. Wang also said that he was very pleased with the vitality of Shanxi and Suiyuan and hoped that the whole country would work together to carry out the arduous task of national restoration. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] After the anniversary ceremony of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council on the morning of the 17th, a joint celebration was held. The Shanxi-Mongolia band played Mongolian music to add to the atmosphere. The entire Ceremony Committee is scheduled to close the meeting from the morning of the 18th to about the 21st. Zhao Pi'lian will leave Suiyuan after the meeting, pass through Shanxi, and return to Nanjing. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Wang's Speech at the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council</h3>
<p>[Guihua] Chairman Wang's speech at the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council is as follows: Today is the anniversary of the establishment of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee. I am very happy to participate in this grand ceremony. The nationalism of the Kuomintang is to unite all ethnic groups internally, to be friendly and harmonious, and to work together to achieve freedom and equality externally. Mongolian compatriots are all descendants of Genghis Khan, and they have the blood of this hero in their bodies. They will surely be able to deeply understand and work together. Last year, I took a few months of sick leave and recuperated in Europe. I saw a country where, because people on both sides relied on strong countries, the result was that people on both sides killed each other. When I returned to China, I heard that the number of people who had killed each other had reached more than 200,000. The capital of Madrid has been shattered. This tragedy of mutual killing has not ended to this day and is getting worse. Seeing this fact, I cannot help but think of my Mongolian compatriots. Outer Mongolia is relying on a strong country, thinking that it is safe. Eastern Mongolia is also relying on another strong country, also thinking that it is safe. But they do not know that once these two strong countries clash, the compatriots of Outer Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia will be sacrificed. The tragic scene of this mutual killing is really painful to think about. Now, China is indeed in the midst of national difficulties. However, with its large territory and large population, if we are of one heart and one mind and move forward together, we will surely be able to turn danger into safety. The most important thing is to strive for self-reliance and never rely on others. We can be friends with any strong country, but we must never rely on them. We firmly believe that this is the only way to save the country and survive. It is the only guarantee. The Mongolian compatriots in Suiyuan are already connected with the Han compatriots. They are in the same territory, under the same sovereignty. Our first priority is to save ourselves. The second is to save others. That is, if we exert all our strength and strive for survival, we will not only be able to save ourselves, but also be able to inspire the compatriots of Outer Mongolia and Eastern Mongolia to escape the tragedy of relying on others and killing each other. Since the establishment of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee, under the guidance of the Chief Executive, the joint efforts of Chairman Sha, Vice Chairman A, and all the committee members have achieved considerable success. The disputes between the Han and Mongolians have been resolved one by one, especially in the recent defense of the territory and resistance against Japan, which is enough to show the spirit of national restoration. The Central Government deeply admires this and will do its best to benefit the autonomy and economic life of the Mongolian compatriots in Suiyuan. I believe that this meeting will inevitably have many proposals that will make great contributions to promoting benefits and eliminating harms. I only hope that everyone will work hard to achieve them. Now, to sum it up in one sentence, we Mongolian and Han compatriots must recognize that the country and the nation depend entirely on our own strength to revive them. We also believe that Mongolian compatriots have the blood of Genghis Khan's heroes in their bodies and will be able to shoulder this mission and make it a success. I would like to express my best wishes for the bright future of the Suiyuan Mongolian Political Affairs Committee and the health of the Mongolian compatriots.

<h3>Yan's Instructions to the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council</h3>
<p>[Guihua] Yan Xishan, the Chief Executive of the Suiyuan-Mongolia Political Council, delivered the following speech at the council's anniversary meeting on the morning of the 17th: I am very happy to be able to meet with all the Mongolian banner princes and governors at the first anniversary of the establishment of this council. In the past year, everyone has carried out the council's affairs according to the prescribed plan and has made achievements. I am ashamed that I have not been able to participate together due to other duties. Today, I would like to take this opportunity to explain two things to everyone: (1) There are many countries in the world that are composed of various ethnic groups. China is not a single ethnic nation, but is also composed of several ethnic groups. Although it is a country composed of several ethnic groups, because it lives within a common territory, the requirements of life and the guarantee of survival have common interests. Therefore, our ethnic groups are consistent externally and equal internally. Our nation is now on the path of restoration, and common efforts mean common development. (2) Autonomy is a good thing, and we cannot oppose it. However, simply knowing that autonomy is a good thing cannot achieve the actual effect of autonomy, and the people will still not be satisfied. We strive to help the Mongolian people achieve autonomy. The methods of helping are to develop education and increase production. Because to be a modern nation, without these two conditions, we cannot consolidate the foundation of self-reliance. I hope that everyone will develop autonomy from the standpoint of the common interests of the country, consolidate the ethnic united front, and improve the happiness of the Mongolian people. I am willing to work hard with you all. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>All Circles in Suiyuan Host Banquet for Representatives from Various Places</h3>
<p>[Guihua] All circles in Suiyuan hosted a public banquet for Wang Jingwei and representatives from various places on the evening of the 16th. Chiang's representative Xiong Bin and He Yingqin's representative Yan Kuan and others left for Ping [Beiping] on the evening of the 16th and then transferred to Nanjing to report back. Yang Yuchun and others, representatives from newspapers in Pingjin [Beiping-Tianjin] who came to Suiyuan to pay respects, returned to Ping on the evening of the 16th.

<p>After participating in the memorial service, Tang Enbo returned to Pingdiquan on the afternoon of the 17th. Zhao Chengzhou will return to Datong within a few days. Representatives from various places who came to Suiyuan to pay respects have left Suiyuan one after another. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Righteous People in Eastern Suiyuan Commended for Their Meritorious Service in Fighting the War</h3>
<p>[Guihua] Zhang Ziqing, a righteous person from eastern Suiyuan, was commended for his meritorious service in fighting the war. Wang Jingwei gave him special comfort. Before Yan left on the 17th, he ordered Zhang to go to Shanxi. Zhang is preparing to leave within a few days. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Yan Issues Statement in Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Yan said in Suiyuan that since Suiyuan was designated as a special district, the population has been growing daily, and it has recently reached two million. Everything has progressed compared to before. The war in eastern Suiyuan this time has aroused national sympathy and assistance, and the revitalization of the nation is promising. Regarding the issue of preventing communism in the Northwest, the Third Plenary Session has already had a case to eradicate the Red disaster. However, the issue in eastern Suiyuan has not affected the prevention of communism. I have no plans to go to Nanjing in the short term. The candidate for the successor to the Qingxiang Superintendent of Shanxi has not yet been decided. Xu Yongchang will return to Shanxi and then discuss it again. There are more than 20 factories in Shanxi Province, with a capital of about 20 million. Shanxi Province plans to complete 5,000 miles of highways within a considerable period of time. The Datong-Puzhou Railway is scheduled to be completed in August this year, and it is also planned to build the Shuoxian-Suiyuan Railway. The capital is set at 6 million, and it is planned to use the Datong-Puzhou Railway as collateral to borrow money from the bank. The Shuosui Railway is about 400 miles long, and surveying has already begun. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Xiong Cheng and Others Have Arrived in Ping from Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Beiping] General Representative Xiong Bin and He's Representative Yan Kuan, who went to Suiyuan to participate in the memorial service, returned to Ping today and are scheduled to return to Nanjing on the morning of the 18th to report back. (Special dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Xiong Bin left Suiyuan for Ping and returned to Nanjing on the evening of the 16th because the memorial service and military parade had ended. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Wang's Speech at the Welcome Meeting</h3>
<p>[Guihua] Chairman Wang's speech at the welcome meeting of all circles in Suiyuan on the afternoon of the 16th is as follows: I was ordered by the Central Government to come to Suiyuan to pay respects to the military and civilians who died in the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan, and to pay tribute to all comrades and compatriots who have worked hard for the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan. I am afraid that my words are simple and clumsy and cannot fully convey the intentions of the Central Government, but I am really unworthy of such a welcome from everyone. Suiyuan is the forefront of national defense, and you are comrades and compatriots who are working hard at the forefront of national defense. How much the Central Government values the forefront of national defense, how much it cares about and pays attention to the comrades and compatriots who are working hard at the forefront of national defense, I have a sincere heart, but I can't express it even to one ten-thousandth. Recalling the slogan of "uniting sincerely and working together to overcome national difficulties" since the September 18th Incident, it has not only spread to the entire party, but also to the entire country. After the Battle of Shanghai and the Battle of the Great Wall passes, we deeply feel that there are various shortcomings in organization and material construction.</p>

<p>We cannot save the country and survive without making a painful decision and working hard. Therefore, on July 28, 1933, Chairman Chiang and I sent a joint telegram, explaining today's priorities. In terms of foreign affairs, we should determine the minimum limit and the most necessary determination to sacrifice. In terms of domestic affairs, there is nothing more urgent than to eliminate the Communist bandits, and there is nothing more fundamental than to promote production and construction. Since then, Chairman Chiang has worked hard, leading comrades and working hard. In terms of suppressing bandits, from Jiangxi to Hunan, to Guizhou, Yunnan, and Sichuan, and even to the Northwest, it is almost clear. Suddenly, there was the incident of December 12th last year, which almost shook the foundation. Fortunately, it turned danger into safety, and with proper handling, the bandit suppression work can probably be concluded in the near future. In terms of production and construction, we have also done some work in the past few years. The details are too numerous to mention. However, these results are not satisfactory. Not only are they not satisfactory, but they have revealed a great crisis. What is this crisis? That is, although we have done some work in material construction, there has been a great setback in the spiritual aspect. Because the national crisis is getting closer and closer, people with conscience and enthusiasm are heartbroken by the current situation and cannot fully understand the meaning of working hard. As a result, some are disappointed, and some are so激angerous that they make hasty decisions. This is already very regrettable. As for those who have no conscience or enthusiasm, they simply give in to inertia, thinking that they can steal safety and get by. The most despicable ones openly think that it is wise to be a traitor. This crisis reached an extremely critical juncture in the months of June, July, August, and September of 1935. During this period, Chairman Chiang, who was concerned about the safety of the party and the country, saw this point clearly and flew back to Nanjing from Sichuan to preside over the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee. At the same time, Director Yan, who was concerned about the safety of the party and the country, also saw this point clearly and flew to Nanjing from Taiyuan to jointly preside over the major plans of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee and the Fifth National Congress. Since then, Chairman Chiang has been in charge of the central structure, and Director Yan has been responsible for the great task of safeguarding Shanxi and Suiyuan, working together to save the greatest crisis of the country and the nation. During this period, I was suffering from illness and injury. I neither died nor worked, which makes me feel really sad. When the resistance against Japan in Suiyuan had factual manifestations, this crisis was saved. In other words, the spirit of the existence of the country and the nation was revived from decline. The greatest significance of the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan in Suiyuan for the country and the nation lies in this. Just now, I heard the chairman's words that he is not satisfied with the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan. This not only shows the chairman's humility, but also shows the chairman's foresight. Because our current national crisis has not been resolved, and it may become more serious in the future. We must still work hard and continue to move forward vigorously in production and construction in order to enrich the people's strength and enhance the country's strength. Not to mention the whole country, even in Suiyuan, if the people's livelihood is not free from suffering and social economy is not greatly improved, even if there is enthusiasm, we cannot shoulder greater responsibilities. The financial difficulties and the failure to realize various constructions are also what the military and political authorities are worried about. Therefore, production and construction are necessary conditions for us to seek self-reliance internally and co-existence externally. We will never miss the opportunity, and we will inevitably work tirelessly. However, our minimum limit and most necessary sacrifices will not be abandoned because of this. In other words, we will use every moment of our lives for production and construction. However, when the minimum limit requires the most necessary sacrifice, we will inevitably throw away all the accumulation of production and construction over the years, as well as our lives, for the country and the nation, without any reluctance. If someone wants a piece of our territory, they must know that this piece of territory must be dripping with our blood and must not be easily stepped over, nor can it be stepped over. Yesterday, we saw the graves of the martyrs who died in the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan. We will never let them die alone, while we live. We live to continue their legacy of defending the territory and resisting Japan. We die to continue their legacy of defending the territory and resisting Japan. We only have two destinations: one is that everyone dies for the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan, making the Republic of China a public tomb for 400 million people; the other is that the Republic of China embarks on the road of freedom and equality, and our descendants share a paradise-like happiness.

<h3>Wang and Yan's Speeches at the Suiyuan Military Parade</h3>
<p>[Guihua] Chairman Wang's speech at the military parade on the morning of the 16th is as follows: Director Yan, Chairman Fu, all officials, all armed comrades, and people from all walks of life, this time I was ordered by the Central Government to come to Suiyuan to express my utmost respect and love to the military and civilians who are defending the territory and resisting Japan. Yesterday, I participated in the solemn memorial service and saw the graves filled with the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country. Today, I participated in the enthusiastic military parade and saw the spirit of your struggle. I also saw the wounded soldiers and the common people who deeply understand righteousness and are not threatened by power or tempted by profit. My heart is filled with respect and love, and I really cannot express it. Recalling that since last autumn, the bandits and puppet troops invaded Suiyuan, the sovereignty of the country's territory was in danger. Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission presided over the central hub, and Director Yan shouldered the great responsibility of defending the local area. Chairman Chuan and all the officers and soldiers fought bravely and resisted, not afraid of hardship or danger. This spirit has been unanimously supported by all sectors of the country, and the military and civilians in all provinces regard it as one body, sharing weal and woe. The Mongolian princes were especially able to deeply understand righteousness and do their best to support. After several months of resistance, the lost territory was recovered, and the territory that had not been lost was preserved intact. This is really a great road to national revival in a critical and precarious situation, giving 400 million people bright hope for the future of the Republic of China. We must know that the significance of this resistance is of great importance in history and in the current situation. Because in history, when we encounter foreign insults, it is often not just the foreign insults that lead us to destruction. The greatest cause of our destruction is actually internal traitors. Chinese people destroying China is the most heartbreaking stain in our history. If this stain is not washed clean, the disaster of national subjugation will be unavoidable. The greatest significance of this resistance is to break the historical legacy of Chinese people destroying China. It is to use the patriotic blood of our compatriots to wash away these stains. This blood is the most precious and the most pure. Relying on this blood, we can not only wash away the previous stains, but also awaken the current national soul. We recall the spirit of Zhang Ziqing, a commoner in the eastern Suiyuan campaign, who rejected bribes, lured the enemy, and bravely defended the country. If every person and every commoner can take this as an example, then who in the world can alienate our compatriots? Who else would dare to invade our territory again? From now on, within the Republic of China, everyone will be of one heart and one mind, and we will move forward bravely. We will surely break this precarious situation and enable China to revive and achieve the road of freedom and equality. Now, the blood of the soldiers and civilians who resisted Japan has already been shed, and their lives have already been dedicated to the country and the nation. However, their spirit will always exist in the hearts of the generals and people who have shared weal and woe since the beginning of the resistance, and it will also exist in the hearts of the generals and people of the whole country. Their pure blood is sprinkled on the Guangda territory, so that the enemy dare not step into one inch. If all our soldiers and all our people can prepare to sprinkle pure blood on our territory, then not only will the unlost territory be permanently preserved, but the lost territory will surely be recovered piece by piece as our blood is sprinkled. This is the great significance of the Suiyuan resistance, and it is also the great significance of our commemorating the soldiers and civilians who died in the battle. The martyrs' cemetery we saw yesterday, every cup of soil, is the foundation for the revival of the country and the nation. The blood shed by our armed comrades and our people for the defense of the territory and resistance against Japan, as well as the painstaking efforts we have made, every bit and drop has seeped into the foundation of the revival of the country and the nation, making it solidified into iron. Last year's glorious victory in the defense of the territory has proved that our sacrifices and efforts have not been in vain. Today, we want to let the people of the whole country know that sacrifices must be made in unison, and we must not let the military and civilians in one part of Suiyuan sacrifice alone. Although our sacrifices are first and last, we continue to go on this road. The painstaking efforts we put in during our lifetime and the blood we shed at the time of our death, bit by bit, form the foundation for the revival of the country and the nation. From today onwards, the country and the nation will face greater suffering and deeper crises. However, we firmly believe that as long as the compatriots who have not died can continue the legacy of the martyrs for the country and the nation, and with the determination to live and die together, and work tirelessly, then the time when we die for the country may be first, but our spirit and our purpose are exactly the same. In this way, the spirit of the soldiers and civilians who died in the battle will not die, and it is this spirit that has formed the foundation for the revival of the country and the nation. Finally, I would like to express my utmost respect to the martyrs who died in the battle and to the military and civilians who defended the territory and resisted Japan on behalf of the Central Government. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 16th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Vice Chairman Yan's speech at the military parade is as follows: Let's think about it carefully. Has today's defense of the territory and resistance against Japan been successful? Can Suiyuan live a peaceful life from now on? All the soldiers, I don't think so, I believe you don't think so either, I hope you don't think so. When the enemy's artillery fire hits our doorsteps, we should defend our territory. This is not a matter of weighing the pros and cons. Fortunately, since August of last year, thanks to the spirit of loyalty and bravery in resisting Japan, we won victories in the battles of Tumurtai, Honggetu, Bailingmiao, and Damiao, thus enabling the people of Suiyuan to live a relatively peaceful life today. Soldiers, but we must not forget the lessons since the September 18th Incident, and we must be determined to defend the territory and resist Japan. We must work harder and prepare our strength to defend our territory. Soldiers, more than 400 military and civilians sacrificed their lives in this resistance, but their deaths brought peace to Suiyuan and consolidated the first line of national defense. Dear soldiers, we must protect the legacy left by the military and civilians who died in the battle and continue their great cause, so that it can flourish and grow. Otherwise, how can we be worthy of the heroes who died in the battle, and how can we be worthy of the warm expectations of our 400 million compatriots? Dear soldiers, the heroes who died in the battle have sown the seeds of self-reliance and national salvation for us. We must cultivate it, irrigate it, and make it germinate, blossom, and bear fruit. We must be worthy of the heroes who died in the battle and the warm expectations of our 400 million compatriots. We can only invigorate our military courage, continue the spirit of the fallen soldiers, work hard to prepare, and strive for the country.

<h3>Elucidation of the Meaning of "Cherishing Benevolence and Befriending Neighbors"</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>After the Japanese Economic Observation Group, led by Kodama Kenji, arrived in Beijing, they received warm hospitality from all parties. Premier Chiang, in the capacity of the leader of the Party and the nation, welcomed the distinguished guests and delivered a sincere and earnest speech at a banquet. In his speech, he mentioned that Japanese Viscount Shibusawa had quoted the saying from the Analects, "Do not do unto others what you do not want done unto you," and considered it to be a characteristic of the Eastern spirit. He hoped that everyone present could understand this idea well, just like the Viscount. Finally, he presented Kodama with the phrase "Cherishing benevolence is a treasure" and concluded by calling for a joint effort to cherish benevolence and befriend neighbors. The unsaid implications were expressed in a tactful way. The host can be said to be skilled in rhetoric, and the listeners could not help but be moved. We, being insensitive, would like to further elucidate the four words "Cherishing benevolence and befriending neighbors."</p>
<p>In today's world of rapid advancement in civilization, the condemnation of war has taken deep root in people's hearts. Although there are one or two advocates of militarism who are stirring up a murderous atmosphere, the majority of countries are constantly striving to eliminate violence and maintain a peaceful situation. The meaning of benevolence is of utmost importance in this regard. As for China and Japan, two countries that are adjacent to each other and have close magnetic ties of mutual concern, the need to seek the way of good neighborliness is something that both sides have long been familiar with. Unfortunately, past events have been too bizarre, going in opposite directions, making it impossible to follow. After suffering from deep wounds, we still uphold friendship and practice self-restraint out of consideration for cherishing benevolence, which has made it difficult for our neighbors to be kind. The depth of guilt lies only in this. The mission of Kodama and his group is to promote the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations. Therefore, they must be willing to accept Chiang's advice. As for what is called a joint effort, some may think that we have reached the point where we can no longer cherish benevolence or befriend neighbors. Now we can only expect the other side to act diligently, and there is no room for us to make further efforts. However, under this circumstance, the estrangement is deepening. Even if Kodama and others can have an understanding of "Cherishing benevolence is a treasure" and know how to promote the characteristics of the Eastern spirit, whether their advocacy of cherishing benevolence and befriending neighbors can avoid being constrained by powerful forces is still a big question. How to eliminate this obstacle in order to see the coordination of true good neighborliness still depends on our efforts. The so-called joint effort will be on their side, not on ours.</p>
<p>We firmly believe that there are many people of insight in Japan who know that aggression is not a good strategy. However, they are intimidated by the tyrannical will of a small group of people, and they sigh and dare not make any claims. The formation of this tyrannical will is due to the ease with which they have illegally seized things in the past, leading them to believe that they can take whatever they want now. They do not realize that times have changed and the situation is different. When things become unbearable, they will inevitably end up in a state of mutual destruction. Therefore, we must clearly express our firm attitude today and not make any more concessions. We must prepare to sacrifice everything and make a desperate gamble, so that Kodama and others can declare this in their country and awaken the delusional dreams of those who have consistently invaded. We must seek peace amidst full armament and maintain friendship under a strong will. Only in this way can we gradually embark on the right path of improving relations between the two countries. Only in this way can we promote the realization of cherishing benevolence and befriending neighbors on both sides.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Re-Discussed Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>[London] The smuggling incident in northern China has been raised for discussion twice in the British House of Commons in February. Today, in the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Cranborne, in response to a question from Conservative Member of Parliament Smylles, stated that the British Ambassador has repeatedly urged the Japanese government to pay attention to the smuggling incident in northern China, and said that the detailed measures for relief are best handled by the relevant authorities themselves. The most important point is that the customs officers in China must have the freedom to actively exercise their powers. This point has been repeatedly stated to the Japanese government by the British Ambassador to Japan. (Reuters telegram from the Central News Agency on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Japan Insists on Quality over Quantity in Naval Restrictions</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Join Treaty on Gun Caliber, Britain Prepares to Build 50,000-Ton Battleships</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government had previously refused to participate in the new London Treaty established in 1936. However, the British government intended to request Japan's participation in the qualitative provision that forms the core of the treaty, limiting the main gun caliber of battleships to 14 inches, and to negotiate with Japan. As the deadline for the Japanese government's response on April 1st gradually approached, after careful consideration, it was decided to issue a response to the British government within days. The Japanese government believes that an agreement with only qualitative restrictions and no quantitative restrictions goes against the spirit of disarmament. Therefore, the content of the response seems to indicate a refusal to participate in the treaty restricting gun caliber. According to the new London Treaty, if one of the signatories of the Washington Treaty does not participate, the gun caliber of battleships (35,000 tons) with 14-inch guns can be expanded to 16 inches. Therefore, if Japan does not participate, Britain, the United States, France, and Italy will inevitably strengthen their battleships and, depending on the shipbuilding plans of other countries, may invoke automatic escalation clauses to build battleships equipped with massive guns exceeding 16 inches. From this perspective, the new London Treaty merely stipulates mutual notification of shipbuilding plans among countries and loses its nature as a disarmament treaty. (16th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The British naval community is greatly disappointed by the Japanese government's decision to reject the proposal to limit the maximum gun caliber to 14 inches. It is now widely expected that Britain will build 50,000-ton battleships. British naval officials initially hoped that the recent changes in the Japanese cabinet would lead to a more moderate stance than that expressed by the Japanese delegation at the 1935 London Naval Conference. However, they did not expect Japan to remain steadfastly unchanged. It is reported that France and Italy welcome the 14-inch gun caliber limit, and the Soviet Union and Germany are also quite willing to endorse this proposal, awaiting Japan's decision to determine their course of action. The United States has been unwilling to accept this proposal from the outset. Now that Japan has announced its opposition, it is widely believed that the two battleships that the United States will begin building in July of this year will be equipped with 16-inch guns. The United States firmly believes that 35,000-ton warships can also mount 16-inch guns without sacrificing the armor of their hulls. However, British naval experts, based on their experience with the Rottalesque and Hood-class warships, strongly disagree. Therefore, an increase in the tonnage of British battleships may ultimately be unavoidable. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] It has been learned that the Soviet Union is now requesting Britain to convene a naval conference so that naval powers that have not signed the London Naval Treaty (i.e., the one signed by Britain, France, and the United States on March 25, 1936) can reach an agreement. Since the establishment of the London Naval Treaty, Britain has been negotiating separately with the Soviet Union, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries, hoping to reach bilateral agreements and persuade these countries to accept the qualitative restrictions contained in the London Naval Treaty. As a result of these talks, agreements have been reached in principle with the Soviet Union and Germany. Britain still insists on conducting separate talks with each naval power and believes that the procedure proposed by the Soviet Union is inappropriate, and intends to politely persuade the country to abandon this proposal.

<h3>Soviet Cultural Circles Issue a Strong Appeal</h3>
<p>Fascism Incites War; Hope for Global Effort to Avert It</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Izvestia newspaper published a letter from Soviet cultural circles to progressive and advanced individuals worldwide, stating: "Twenty-three years ago, a single shot in the Balkans ignited the powder keg of Europe. Within four years, the entire world was shaken by slaughter and destruction. Today, the blood and tears have dried, but the memories linger. Humanity has exhausted its efforts to establish world peace, but the sound of new gunfire is already ringing in our ears.</p>
<p>"What is currently taking place in Spain is not the suppression of a rebellion, nor is it an internal conflict. The countries at war with Spain are Germany and Italy, and General Franco is merely their puppet. The armies of these two fascist states have invaded Spain and are waging war. The conduct of the war, apart from its unprecedented barbarity and cruelty, is no different from any war in imperialist history.</p>
<p>"War is now underway in Europe; war is currently taking place. And the League of Nations covenant states: 'Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League.' The bloodthirsty beast has become increasingly savage and rampant, dominating the world, plundering people, and occupying land. All of this is the aim of fascism: organized national banditry, shamelessly flaunted before the world. We must, on behalf of thinking humanity, declare to the world: Enough! We can no longer tolerate the evil deeds and banditry of these fascist psychopaths, allowing them to attempt to drown the twenty million heroic people of Spain in a sea of blood. We can no longer sit idly by as the structures built by the people to preserve peace in Europe are destroyed. We can no longer tolerate the shameful clamor of the so-called Non-Intervention Committee, allowing it to carry out behind the scenes a conspiracy to sell out the women and children of Spain, and to strive to delay time under the diplomatic charade of challengers.</p>
<p>"Enough! Cultural figures, we demand that you declare resolutely to your governments. We expect you to voice your firm protests against what is currently taking place, and the voices of you and all sane humanity. If we do not force these scoundrels to regain their sanity, then the criminal acts that will follow will be unavoidable. War has already begun. The fascist governments have decided to force history to replay the nightmare of world massacres. Stop their evil now; it is now or never." (16th, TASS)</p>

<h3>Death of Former British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain</h3>
<p>Suffered from Heart Disease, Medicine Ineffective, Passed Away at the Age of Seventy-Four; Dedicated His Life to European Peace and Was Known for His Pro-French Stance</p>
<p>[London] Sir Austen Chamberlain, Conservative Member of Parliament for the British House of Commons, passed away at his private residence in London at 6:00 PM today due to heart disease, at the age of seventy-four. He had been ill for only a few days. Austen Chamberlain was born in 1863, graduated from Cambridge University, and first entered the House of Commons as a representative for East Worcestershire. After his father's death, he succeeded his father as the representative for West Birmingham. He successively held important positions such as Civil Lord of the Admiralty, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, and Postmaster General. From 1903 to 1905, he served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In 1915, he served as Secretary of State for India in the coalition cabinet formed until 1917. In the Baldwin cabinet, he served as Foreign Secretary. In 1925, he received the highest honor from the British monarch for his contribution to the promotion of the Locarno Treaties, and also served as Lord Privy Seal for a time.</p>
<p>Austen Chamberlain's father was also a great politician, and the father and son were often referred to together. However, the father was known for his strong and vigorous hand, while Austen was modest, restrained, and quietly contemplative, differing from his father. From a young age, born into a gentry family, his movements, words, and actions displayed a solemn and respectful demeanor. Even with his classmates, he was cautious and self-disciplined, rarely smiling.</p>
<p>Austen Chamberlain's true political career began when he was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in 1903. In 1912, when Conservative Party leader Balfour was waning, Austen had high hopes of being promoted to leader, but was thwarted by Walter Long, and the leadership position ultimately went to Bonar Law. It is said that Austen's birth into an aristocratic family was both his fortune and his misfortune. Superficial commentators often said that Austen owed his prominence to his father's influence, but in reality, Austen possessed his own unique talent and could have become a great politician even without his father's help. However, Austen lacked political ambition. It is said that he could only be a conscientious and meticulous official, serving with the demeanor of a great minister, but lacking the special talent for political construction.</p>
<p>Austen was a powerful administrator, eloquent, and when the Conservative Party was in opposition for the past decade, Austen's influence in Parliament grew. In his later years, he was particularly known for his invincible eloquence. He had no close friends, but was loved by his colleagues for his kindness and approachability. After the European War, he devoted himself to the cause of European peace and was known for his pro-French stance. It was said that Austen loved France as a man loves a woman, but Austen himself said that the Anglo-French friendship was the foundation of true peace, and that he was not so infatuated with a woman as to forget his obligation to treat others with impartiality.</p>
<p>After the failure of the Geneva Agreement, Austen sought to build peace on another foundation, so that Germany and its former enemy countries could enter into treaties to maintain the situation in Western Europe, while the borders of Eastern Europe could not be altered by means of war. In 1925, the Locarno Treaties were concluded, with Germany, France, and Belgium agreeing not to attack each other, and Britain and Italy serving as guarantors of the treaty. Germany also agreed with Poland and Czechoslovakia to maintain peace in the East, and through Austen's mediation, Germany joined the League of Nations as a member. Afterwards, the British monarch awarded Austen the highest honor for his contribution to the achievement of peace, and in the same year, Austen and U.S. Vice President Charles Dawes jointly received the Nobel Peace Prize.

<h3>Paris Mourns the Loss</h3>
<p>[Paris] The news of the death of former British Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain has been received with widespread mourning in France. Foreign Minister Delbos told a reporter from this agency that Sir Austen Chamberlain's achievements were outstanding, and the people of France have the utmost respect and admiration for him. The cause of peace is the noblest of ideals, and Sir Austen Chamberlain, with this ideal in mind and a pragmatic spirit, was not only a believer in peace but also worthy of being called a pragmatist. This is comparable to his friend, the late French Foreign Minister Briand. Many of the League of Nations' great achievements were accomplished by Austen Chamberlain and Briand in Geneva and Locarno. All peace-loving nations will praise their virtues, and the names of these two sages will be immortal. (Central News Agency, 10th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Heavy Rains Continue in Southern England</h3>
<p>River Levels Continue to Rise, Dam Breaks Feared</p>
<p>[London] In the past twenty-four hours, heavy rains have continued in the Fenlands of southern England, and river levels have risen further. The dikes are in imminent danger. If they collapse, hundreds of square miles of land will be flooded. Last night, radio stations issued warnings, ordering residents to be prepared to evacuate at any time. Personnel reinforcing the dikes have been working tirelessly for three days and nights and are feeling very tired. This morning, several areas appeared to be slightly more secure, allowing for a brief rest. However, the rainfall has intensified, and river levels in many areas are now higher than the surrounding fields. If the dikes do not contain the rising water, the surrounding fields will be flooded. A landslide has occurred between Folkestone and Dover, endangering the railway, causing trains to be suspended. Huge cracks have appeared in the ground, and further subsidence is feared. According to weather forecasts, there is no expectation of an immediate cessation of the heavy rains. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Tragic Mine Fire in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan</h3>
<p>Poisonous Gas Prevents Rescue Efforts; Fifty-Four Miners Feared Dead</p>
<p>⊙Shizuoka Following the tragic fire at the Osawa Mine in Mount Hakuyetsu on the 15th, authorities made every effort to conduct rescue operations. Forty-one individuals who entered the mine shaft to fight the fire were surrounded and suffocated by poisonous gas. Seventeen miners then ventured into the void twice to rescue them, but none returned alive. Authorities dispatched three suicide squads with gas masks at 4:00 PM, 6:00 PM, and 7:00 PM, but due to the excessive poisonous gas and the imperfection of the masks, they were unsuccessful. They are now awaiting the assistance of the army's anti-gas unit. At midnight, a fourth suicide squad entered the shaft to investigate the internal situation. According to their report, all fifty-four miners had died of asphyxiation, with no hope of survival. At 10:30 AM on the 16th, Major Akiyama of the Narashino Flight School arrived with his troops and immediately prepared for rescue. At 1:00 AM on the 17th, after the poisonous gas had dissipated, they entered the shaft with masks and began to remove the bodies. As of 5:00 AM this morning, a total of thirty-six bodies had been removed. However, around 6:00 AM, the poisonous gas reappeared, forcing them to stop working. Families of the miners who perished came to the scene and wept, and the situation was quite tragic. (17th, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>Two Thousand German Antique Books Donated to the University of London</h3>
<p>University Students Hold Banners to Protest to the German Ambassador</p>
<p>[London] The German government recently donated two thousand antique books to the Institute of Historical Research here. The German Ambassador, Ribbentrop, personally presented them to the Institute. A group of university students staged a demonstration, expressing their animosity towards Ribbentrop. It was raining heavily at the time, and the students stood in the rain in front of the Institute, holding banners with the words "German University Students Imprisoned," "We Demand Freedom for the Victims of German Intellectual Suppression," etc. When Ribbentrop descended from his vehicle, the students surrounded him, shouting slogans such as "Down with Fascism" and "Fascism Destroys Culture." Ribbentrop, observing this situation, remained calm, pushed through the crowd, and entered the Institute. The protesters then dispersed. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)</p>
<h3>U.S. Reciprocal Trade Agreement Policy Extends to the Far East</h3>
<p>Preparing to Negotiate with Japan</p>
<p>[Washington] Government officials today began to study the possibility of extending the reciprocal trade agreement policy to countries in the Far East. It is reported that Japan may be selected first for negotiations, as trade relations between Japan and the United States have been fraught with disputes recently, and the volume of trade between the two countries is particularly large. Japanese officials here have expressed interest in this agreement in private conversations, but formal negotiations have not yet begun. (16th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>

<h3>British Army Budget Totals £60 Million</h3>
<p>£7 Million Increase Compared to Last Year; Infantry and Artillery to Be Mechanized</p>
<p>[London] Secretary of State for War Cooper presented the Army Estimates in the House of Commons today, with total expenditures for the Army for the coming year amounting to £63,120,000, an increase of £7,239,000 compared to 1936. In addition, certain expenditures of £19,054,000 will be allocated from the National Defence Public Debt Fund. Cooper stated that it is necessary to maintain an efficient, sufficient, and readily deployable expeditionary force at all times. Regarding the mechanization of the army, the Italian experience in Abyssinia can be learned from. The success of military operations there depended entirely on agility. The progress of British army mechanization is currently satisfactory. The government has decided that a mechanized brigade should consist of a fully mechanized infantry regiment and two light tank regiments. New armored vehicles have recently been manufactured and will be distributed to various units for use this year. The Army authorities are very satisfied with the new light tanks, but the status of medium and heavy tanks is not as well-established. However, research is underway, and a decision on how to design them is expected soon. The mechanization of the artillery regiment is expected to be completed by the end of this year. In recent years, there has been little funding for military equipment, so that the great capacity of British factories to manufacture munitions at the end of the European War has almost disappeared. Therefore, it is now necessary to restore this capacity from scratch. Much progress has been made in a short period of time in the work of re-equipping the entire army. This work is expected to be completed in one or two years. Recruitment for the Territorial Army is very smooth and is now showing improvement. However, recruitment for the Regular Army is less successful because the British people prefer to serve in the Navy and Air Force. Various preferential measures are currently being implemented to encourage enlistment in the Army, such as establishing new training centers for veterans and abolishing the Indian government's system of increasing the service period of British soldiers stationed in India by one year. In the future, soldiers will have four meals a day instead of three, and the deduction from military uniforms will also be abolished. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>French Communist Party Members Demonstrate Against Fascism</h3>
<p>Stones and Bricks Fly in Serious Conflict; Five Dead, Over Two Hundred Seriously and Slightly Wounded; Mobile Squad Forced to Open Fire; Workers Strike in Protest</p>
<p>[Paris] The Parti Social Français, reorganized from the fascist Croix-de-Feu league, held a meeting this evening at the Olympic Cinema near the Clichy Town Hall in the suburbs. A large number of anti-fascist protesters held a counter-demonstration in front of the cinema, and serious clashes soon broke out between the two sides. Mobile squads were dispatched to intervene, and both sides threw stones and glass bottles at the mobile squads. The members of the squads then used their rifle butts to strike back, eventually driving away the crowd. Several gunshots were also heard amidst the disturbances. The conflict ceased at 11:15 PM. Currently, over a hundred vehicles carrying mobile squads are patrolling the streets near the Olympic Cinema and the Clichy Town Hall, and ambulances are also patrolling the city to rescue the wounded. Citizens are talking about the incident in groups of three or five, and everyone is extremely excited. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] Thousands of Communist Party members, each holding bricks, bottles, sticks, etc., gathered in the Clichy district today, intending to disrupt a Fascist Party meeting. Serious clashes broke out between the two sides. According to a police announcement, five people were killed, eighty seriously injured and hospitalized, and two hundred and twenty slightly injured. One hundred and forty police officers and mobile squad members were also injured. Eighteen protesters were arrested. Blum's secretary, Blumel, was hit by a bullet. A mobile squad leader, a city councillor, and several police officers were also among the injured. Prime Minister Blum, accompanied by his secretary, went to the scene of the incident to inspect, and fortunately was unharmed. The crowd also threw bricks and stones at the mobile squad members, who then charged at the rioting crowd and opened fire. The crowd then scattered and fled. The Prime Minister's official residence is now guarded by mobile squad members. Left-wing party members were very angry when they heard that the mobile squad had opened fire. Seven or eight thousand construction workers at the Exposition site declared a one-hour strike in protest. Soon, 1,200 workers at the Ravalet hardware factory also staged a sit-down strike to express their dissatisfaction. The cabinet, fearing that this bloody incident would lead to a serious situation, immediately planned to discuss measures to ban political gatherings. (16th, Kokumin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Details of the Conflict</h3>
<p>[Paris] Following the clashes between members of the fascist Parti Social Français and Communist Party protesters in the Clichy suburb last night, it has been learned that a total of six people were killed at the time, including four protesters and two police officers. More than two hundred people were injured, mostly right-wingers. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>The Parti Social Français held a private meeting at the Olympic Cinema to watch the film "War" (a film based on the Russo-Japanese War). The Communist Party planned to storm the cinema. At 7:00 PM, members of the Parti Social Français left the cinema one after another under police protection. At that time, many workers belonging to the Communist Party gathered in front of the cinema, numbering about three thousand. The authorities had to mobilize a large team of Republican Guards, 500 police officers, and four special armed police squads to suppress the protesters, so that the members of the Parti Social Français could safely disperse. The Communists then demolished the nearby street surfaces and set up obstacles. Bricks and stones flew like rain, and the police charged at the Communists three times, immediately resulting in clashes. Several gunshots were also heard. Police officers then issued a warning, ordering the crowd to disperse, but the crowd ignored it, eventually leading to a serious conflict. At that time, Interior Minister Dormois and Paris Police Commissioner Langellon arrived at the scene after hearing the alert, along with Cabinet Secretary-General Blumel. Blumel was hit by a stray bullet in the armpit and also injured his right leg. He was immediately taken to the nearby Beaujon Hospital for treatment. Prime Minister Blum then personally went to the hospital to express his condolences. After the doctors treated Blumel's wounds, he returned to his residence to recuperate. In addition, Clichy Mayor Auffray was also seriously injured. Finally, all the Communists on the streets were dispersed by the North African Guards, and the police arrested twenty extreme left-wingers, eight of whom were immediately sent to prison and detained. The Ministry of the Interior then issued a statement stating that the authorities are now investigating the cause of the incident and that residents must remain calm.</p>
<p>The Communist Party's organ, L'Humanité, published news of the incident on the front page, in five columns. Two phrases were included: one said "brutal act of provocation" and the other said "conspiracy against public opinion." It also asked, "Who ordered the police to open fire?" "Colonel de la Rocque (leader of the Parti Social Français, who did not attend the meeting today) should be arrested immediately." "The Parti Social Français meeting should have been banned in advance." "Fascist groups should be seriously disbanded." (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] Following the incident in the suburb of Clichy, the number of dead and injured has now been confirmed. Five protesters were killed and eighty injured, some of whom were seriously injured. One hundred and fifty-seven police officers were injured, three of whom were seriously injured, and the rest were slightly injured. Eighty-four detectives and Republican Guards were injured, three of whom were seriously injured, and the rest were slightly injured. In addition, a total of eighteen protesters were arrested, eleven of whom have been released, while the rest are still in detention. State Secretary-General Blumel's gunshot wound is not serious. It is reported that the government will soon issue an order banning all demonstrations that are likely to cause disturbances. (Central News Agency, 7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Meeting Discusses Aftermath</h3>
<p>[Paris] Following yesterday's clash between the fascist French Social Problems Study Party and anti-fascist masses in the suburb of Clichy, the cabinet has scheduled a meeting for 6 PM today to discuss the aftermath. Furthermore, it is learned that approximately 500 people participated in the French Social Problems Study Party's rally yesterday, while the communist demonstration numbered around 10,000. Newspapers have provided detailed accounts of the conflict, but refrained from extensive commentary. Le Petit Parisien reported that upon hearing of the French Social Problems Study Party members' rally at the Olympic Cinema, communist members began to gather near the cinema from 6 PM onwards, with numbers increasing. They threw bricks at the police. Local authorities, recognizing the dangerous situation, urgently dispatched half a battalion of riot police and 300 policemen to suppress the unrest and protect the French Social Problems Study Party members' safe exit from the cinema. The disturbance was finally quelled by 10:30 PM. The right-wing newspaper L'Action Française reported that the secretary-general of the Communist Party, Doriot, arrived at the scene of the incident in Clichy at 10 PM last night. The demonstrating crowds cheered him loudly, but Doriot declined to give a speech. Instead, another leader of the party advised the members to disperse and return home to avoid further complications. The socialist newspaper Le Populaire stated that during the incident, there was no shortage of troublemakers and agitators mixed in with the protesting crowd.

<h3>Western European Four-Power Pact Issue</h3>
<p>Britain and France Consult on Germany's Opinions</p>
<p>[London] Germany submitted its response to Britain regarding the new Locarno Pact on the 13th of this month, which has further hardened the differing opinions between Germany and Britain and France on the form of the new Western European pact. Germany's note contains two specific proposals as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The neutrality of this country should be guaranteed by the four Western powers, namely Germany, France, Britain, and Italy. ㊁ Germany and France should conclude a non-aggression treaty, with Britain and Italy as guarantors and arbiters, so as to determine which is the aggressor in the event of a conflict. It is noted that Germany did not use the term "neutrality" when referring to Belgium's neutrality in its note, but rather used a vague diplomatic expression, the meaning of which is equivalent to neutrality. Germany's plan includes the following points: ㊀ The four powers should provide the same guarantees to Belgium. ㊁ Staff consultations should not be held unless the four powers participate. ㊂ France should not have the right to transport troops through Belgium. ㊃ Belgium should not assist France or any other country under the League of Nations Covenant. Germany insists that the Franco-German non-aggression treaty should be effective under any circumstances. In other words, Germany does not recognize the exceptions specifically permitted by the old Locarno Treaty, which stipulates that actions under Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant are legal. Germany's proposal to have Britain and Italy act as joint arbiters to judge acts of aggression was already rejected by Britain in Germany's previous note regarding the Locarno Pact. The current German note rejects the entire principle of Western mutual assistance, and particularly does not accept Britain's statement that Britain is a guarantor of France and Belgium and must also guarantee its own security. In general, the wording of the German note is relatively modest and does not specifically mention the Franco-Soviet Pact. However, previous difficulties remain undiminished. Germany still wants to freeze and immobilize all Western actions under the League of Nations Covenant, so that it can act freely in the East. This claim is unlikely to be accepted by Britain and France. The only way forward at present is to deal with the Belgian neutrality issue separately and seek a solution without involving Western or general agreements.

<h3>Belgian King to Visit London</h3>
<p>To Consult on Belgium's Neutral Status</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources, King Leopold III of Belgium will come here for an informal visit in early next week under the guise of participating in golf, to consult with British authorities on the issue of his country's neutral status. According to reports, discussions between Britain and Belgium regarding the King's visit have been ongoing for two weeks. The British government originally intended to invite Belgian Prime Minister Janson or Foreign Minister Spaak to visit, or to send British Foreign Secretary Eden to the Belgian capital while attending the International Chamber of Commerce conference. However, it is generally believed that since the Belgian King delivered a speech in parliament in October last year advocating for his country's return to neutral status, it would be more beneficial for the King himself to personally discuss the matter.

<h3>Work of the London Adjustment Committee Suffers Another Setback</h3>
<p>The West Government's Overseas Gold Reserves Issue; Russian Representative Declares Refusal to Discuss</p>
<p>[London] Today, during the meeting of the non-intervention committee subcommittee to discuss the issue of financial assistance to the Spanish warring parties, a dispute arose, leading to a standstill. Prior to the meeting, the Soviet Union sent a letter to the chairman, Lord Plymouth, stating that the Soviet Union was willing to discuss the issue of financial aid to Spain in principle, but did not agree to negotiations affecting the assets of the Spanish government and the gold reserves of the Spanish bank. Later, there was a heated debate on this matter at the meeting, but no solution was reached. With the representatives of Germany and Italy halting this matter, they expressed their unwillingness to continue discussions on other issues such as the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] At today's meeting of the subcommittee of the London Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Conflict, various methods for preventing indirect intervention were examined. The Soviet representative immediately issued a solemn statement refusing to discuss the "neutralization" of the Spanish Republican government's gold reserves stored abroad. Representatives from Italy and Germany replied that since the Soviet Union had adopted this stance, their respective countries would also refuse to discuss other items on the agenda, including the withdrawal of volunteer soldiers from various countries. It is generally believed that the subcommittee is currently unwilling to oppose the Soviet representative and will refer the gold reserve "neutralization" issue to a committee of legal experts for study. If that happens, the Soviet Union may refuse to discuss the issue of withdrawing volunteer soldiers in retaliation. However, since the Spanish Republican government has already accepted the withdrawal of foreign volunteer soldiers, with the sole condition that the Nationalist side can do the same, the subcommittee can still resolve this matter even if the Soviet Union refuses to discuss it.

Another 30 fighter planes strafed downwards with machine guns. It is also claimed that 35 enemy planes have been lost in the daily engagements, while the government forces have only lost one fighter plane. However, General Queipo de Llano of the Nationalist forces broadcasted a very different message last night, stating that 19 government planes had been shot down in recent battles on the Guadalajara front.

<p>[London] The French government, having learned that 35,000 Italian troops recently landed in Spain, has reportedly contacted the British government, urging it to pay attention and requesting the Adjustment Committee to take action to address the situation. The British government immediately replied, "The information received in London has not confirmed the above news, but instructions have been given to the British Navy at the Port of Gibraltar to conduct an investigation. Once a report is received, a decision will be made on how to proceed." According to well-informed sources, the initial reports from Spain regarding the recent Italian troop landing were of a negative nature. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Mussolini Inspects North Africa</h3>
<p>Arrives in Tripoli; Presides Over Market Opening</p>
<p>⊙Tripoli The tour of Libyan by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini reached its climax today, as he presided over the opening ceremony of the Tripoli market. The scene was unprecedented. Mussolini, riding a white horse and leading local cavalry, entered the city with a victorious air. He then proceeded to the unveiling ceremony in front of the Colossus of Caesar. At that time, many Italian military planes flew in formation overhead, creating a spectacular sight. Mussolini then went to the market for a tour. He was very interested in the German exhibits. Thousands of people from all over came to participate in the exhibition, including those who traveled hundreds of miles or overcame hardships to cross the Sahara. Mussolini delivered a speech to them, first expressing his admiration for the various achievements made in the eleven years since his last inspection of Libya. He then asked overseas colonial compatriots and Arab people to strive to maintain peace under the protection of the Italian tricolor flag, and assured them that their customs, traditions, and religious beliefs would be respected. Mussolini affirmed that the newly built coastal highway is a clear sign of the progress of the Italian Empire. Mussolini not only did not deny the ambitions of Italian imperialism, but even admitted to it. He stated that his tour was sufficient to show that Italy was determined to maintain and develop its empire, which was consistent with the spirit of a "masculine" nation. When Mussolini mentioned the foreign press, he said that many foreign newspapers used his trip to Libya as a basis for spreading rumors, so sensational rumors have spread everywhere, and the result is only to destroy the mutual trust and peace among nations. Mussolini finally affirmed that Italy is willing to live in peace and cooperate with all countries that share the same ideas. (17th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Atrocities Committed by Italian Troops in Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Archbishop of Canterbury Asks Government to Pay Attention</p>
<p>[London] The Archbishop of Canterbury today asked the authorities in the House of Lords to pay attention to the atrocities in Addis Ababa, saying that after the attempted assassination of Abyssinian Governor-General Graziani, Italian authorities seemed to instigate or allow Italian soldiers and Blackshirt militias to take retaliatory measures. February 19 and the following two days can rightly be called days of great slaughter. Blackshirts carrying bombs, arson tools, rifles and pistols rampaged among the local people. Local people within the governor's attacked zone and those who possessed weapons were shot on the spot. Italian soldiers roamed around setting fire to houses, and those who tried to escape were killed. It is believed that the number of deaths was between two thousand and six thousand. Foreign Office Under-Secretary Plymouth replied that the government's reports on the matter were very simple, and that Foreign Office Under-Secretary Cranborne's answer to questions from MPs on March 8 could be used for reference.

<h3>Wang Jingwei Arrives in Taiyuan from Nanjing</h3>
<p>Accompanies Yan on Flight to Suiyuan to Pay Respects to Soldiers and Civilians Killed Defending the Territory</p>
<p>Taiyuan dispatch. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Council, representing the Central Government to participate in the memorial service for the soldiers and civilians killed in Suiyuan in the Republic of China's 25th year defending the territory and resisting the enemy, passed through Taiyuan and met with Yan Xishan, Director of the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters, and Zhao Daiwen, Chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Government. This afternoon (13th), he departed from Nanjing at noon on the Eurasia Aviation Company's No. 18 chartered plane, accompanied by Chu Minyi, Wang Maogong, Lin Baisheng, and secretaries Chen Guoqi, Chen Changtao, and 11 followers. At 4:10 PM, they arrived in Taiyuan. Yan, Zhao, and various military and political officials, civilian officials above the section chief level, military officers above the department head level, as well as representatives from various schools and organizations, and military and political personnel in training, totaling about 2,000 to 3,000 people, were lined up to welcome them at the airport outside the North Gate or the railway station outside the North Gate. From the airport to the city, soldiers and police were stationed along the streets, and security was extremely tight. The temporary residence was set up in the Shanxi Grand Hotel. After Wang alighted from the plane, he exchanged brief greetings with those who welcomed him and then took a car with Yan directly to the hotel. Soon after, Zhao Daiwen, Zhao Pilian, Yang Aiyuan, Zhu Shuguang, Jia Jingde, Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, Zhou Dai, and Rong Hongjie arrived at the hotel in succession, and they held a joyful meeting in the grand living room. Wang reported to Yan in detail the circumstances of the journey. After a dozen or so minutes, Yan excused himself, and the rest of the people also left. Only Zhao Pilian returned to discuss with Wang the itinerary for leaving Taiyuan for Suiyuan tomorrow (14th). Wang decided to depart on the same plane as Yan. If the plane was too crowded, it would fly back and forth between Suiyuan and Taiyuan twice to pick up and drop off passengers.</p>
<p>After Yan took his leave, reporters from various newspapers submitted their name cards to pay their respects. Wang sent Chu Minyi to meet with them on his behalf. Chu briefly discussed the course of Wang's trip and said that Wang would fly to Suiyuan tomorrow (14th) afternoon and attend the memorial service for the soldiers and civilians killed in action the day after tomorrow, representing the Central Government in paying his respects. He would then leave Suiyuan immediately. Whether he would return to Taiyuan for another stay was still undecided. He also said that Wang's liver and diabetes were not completely cured, and the bullet from his assassination attempt had not yet been removed from his back, but it did not matter. He was in good spirits now.</p>
<p>That evening at 7 PM, Yan and Zhao, representing the military and political circles of Shanxi Province, hosted a banquet at the Suiyuan Headquarters to welcome Wang and his party, inviting Meng Bingyue, Mao Kan, and military and political personnel Yang Aiyuan, Sun Chu, Jia Jingde, Zhu Shuguang, Zhao Pilian, Wang Jingguo, and members of the provincial government to accompany them. During the banquet, Wang and Yan had a very pleasant conversation about the international situation and the problems in the Northwest. They ended the joyful gathering at around 9 PM. Afterwards, Wang and Yan opened up another room and talked for an hour. Wang then returned to the hotel. Because Wang's health had not yet recovered, he politely declined to thank the others in addition to Yan and Zhao's banquet.</p>
<p>The military, political, academic, business, and women's circles of Taiyuan City decided to hold a welcome meeting tomorrow (14th) morning at 10 AM at the Great Self-Reflection Hall of the Suiyuan Headquarters, inviting Wang to attend and give a speech. Wang has already nodded in agreement. The two Suiyuan Headquarters notified all circles this (13th) evening to participate at the appointed time.</p>
<p>Yan decided when meeting with Wang this (13th) evening to fly to Suiyuan on the same plane tomorrow (14th) afternoon. Those travelling with him include Guo Fu representative Zhao Pilian, provincial government chairman Zhao Daiwen, as well as Chu Minyi, Wang Maogong, Suiyuan Headquarters Foreign Affairs Section Chief Xue Chongxi, etc. Other personnel and sacrificial items will be transported to Suiyuan by special military transport tomorrow morning. After arriving in Suiyuan, in addition to paying respects to the soldiers and civilians killed in action defending the territory, and attending the military parade, Yan will also attend the anniversary of the Suiyuan Mongolia Political Council on the 17th, and will only be able to return to Taiyuan in about three to five days. Suiyuan Chairman Fu Zuoyi telegraphed this (13th) afternoon, saying that Chairman Wang's and Vice Chairman Yan's headquarters have been prepared, welcoming them to come to Suiyuan. A portion of Yan's entourage departed by car this (13th) to Datong and then to Suiyuan. Yan also intends to draft "An Announcement to the People of Suiyuan," with the contents: ㊀ The military and civilians unite, sacrifice, and fight. ㊁ Strengthen the power of national defense, defend the territory, and resist the enemy. He also intends to draft "An Announcement to the Officers and Soldiers for Thoroughly Implementing the Military Parade for Defending the Territory and Resisting the Enemy," with the contents: Do not forget the lessons since September 18th. We should be determined, prepare the power to kill the enemy to achieve results, sacrifice and save the country, and continue the spirit of the fallen soldiers, defend the territory, and resist the enemy. Both are scheduled to be distributed when they arrive in Suiyuan. (13th)</p>
<h3>Anhui and Henan Salt Merchants Compete Fiercely to Pay Taxes</h3>
<p>Official Offices Collect More Than 14 Million in Guarantee Money; Banks and Salt Merchants Plan to Request Refund of Excess Guarantee Money</p>
<p>Banpu dispatch. In the case of recruiting merchants to contract for the 26th year Anhui and Henan bank additional transport and storage salt, because the competition among the salt merchants was very fierce, in two days, a total of 6.7 million dan was recognized, and the guarantee money collected by the Central Bank reached more than 14 million yuan in national currency. This is an unprecedented record since the opening of Anhui and Henan bank. Considering that the strength of the salt merchants is limited, they all entrusted the local banks in Xinpu and Banpu to pay on their behalf. Now, regarding the excess money, it is heard that the banks and salt merchants intend to demand that the official offices refund the excess guarantee money. However, it is learned that the opinions of the salt merchants are not unified, and whether it can be done is doubtful. Recently, several dozen recognized merchants jointly presented to the ministry, roughly stating that according to Article 1 of the new salt law, "Salt is taxed at the source, and people are free to buy and sell. No one shall be allowed to monopolize." The Anhui and Henan bank has always been a free trade zone. Merchants have always paid taxes and transported without restrictions. Since February 25th, the two Huai transport offices announced additional transport and storage salt and tax payment measures, and they were changed to recruiting merchants to recognize tenancies. At that time, a few self-proclaimed old merchants, wishing to monopolize the contract, falsely accused in the name of the transport merchants' association. As a result, the official offices saw through their intentions and did not care. This year, on February 1st, the two Huai transport offices announced revised Anhui and Henan bank additional transport and storage salt and tax payment measures, which were fair and comprehensive, and all parties were convinced, saying that they could avoid disputes from now on. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM on the first day, some monopolistic elements, with quick means, entrusted three or four banks in Xinpu and Banpu to pay more than 2.1 million dan in guarantee money on their behalf, and then continued to pay 800,000 dan. According to the regulations, the principal amount of 600,000 dan has reached five times the amount. Their intention is to rely on external forces to strike first and suppress other merchants from daring to recognize and pay, in order to achieve the purpose of monopolization. The recognized merchants have a considerable position in operating Beng salt, and there are still more than 200,000 dan of salt taxed in the 25th year that have not been sold. No matter how these people oppress them, they will never stop operating in the salt industry on the banks of the river. However, the measures stipulate that the bank must guarantee, so they immediately issued a list of names entrusting other local banks to recognize and pay on their behalf, so as to continue the operation and maintain the original business. Unexpectedly, the next day, there were several salt firms that accumulated 700,000 dan. In two days, a total of more than 6.69 million dan was paid (including 2.48 million dan paid on behalf by China, 450,000 dan by Jiangsu, 680,000 dan by Zhejiang Xingye, 1.8 million dan by Jiaotong, 1.2 million dan by Shanghai, 50,000 dan by Guomin, and 30,000 dan by Jincheng), exceeding the principal amount by more than eleven times. These people, because their plan was not sold, intentionally disrupted it, separately telegraphed accusations, and even implicated one or two tax-releasing banks. The recognized merchants are all existing salt merchants, operating in the salt industry in the free zone, which is not contrary in the slightest. As for entrusting the bank to pay the guarantee money and adding slander, it is even more unreasonable. Because all the households that recognized and paid this time were paid on behalf by the bank, the facts are all there and can be reviewed. Please uphold justice, etc. It is learned that the Ministry of Finance has instructed the two Huai transport envoys to investigate the case and recover it.</p>
<h3>Jehol Opium Secretly Planned to be Transported to Xiamen</h3>
<p>The First Batch of Goods Has Already Been Distributed; Japanese Arrive in Fujian in an Endless Stream</p>
<p>Xiamen dispatch. The pseudo-"Manchukuo" recently sent Yang Song, a Taiwanese senior official of the Colonization Bureau, to Fujian to negotiate the dumping of goods from the Northeast. After negotiating with the famous opium king Ye, they decided to organize the "South China Trade Company" with a capital of 400,000 yuan. The main business, in addition to soybean cake, flour, fertilizer, cement, and Japanese cotton yarn produced in the Northeast, it is said that they also plan to concurrently operate Yanshi produced in Rehe, smuggling it to Xiamen for sale. The transportation procedures are to first transport it from the Northeast to Tianjin, transfer it to Taiwan, and then transfer it from Taiwan to Xiamen. The first batch of goods has already been distributed. The company plans to send Su to Taiwan to transport Yanshi to Xiamen within days.</p>
<p>Taiwanese agricultural and forestry expert Japanese Taguchi Takashi, and Taiwanese calcium cyanamide fertilizer manufacturing technician Zheng Yaoxi, recently arrived in Xiamen, and accompanied by Yu Junhe, an employee of the Xiamen Mitsui Trading Company, went to Zhangzhou on the 13th to inspect agriculture in Longxi and Changtai counties and promote fertilizer. They returned to Xiamen on the 14th. According to Taguchi, the soil in Longxi and Changqin counties is extremely fertile and does not require fertilizer. It is also very suitable for planting sugarcane and tung. On the 15th, Taguchi again accompanied Takeemura Eisho, the head of Mitsui Xiamen, to visit the Heshan Farm, also to promote fertilizer. They left samples. Recently, the Japanese have been paying close attention to the rural areas of Fujian Province. At the end of February, Dr. Iso Eikichi's delegation of the Taiwan Agricultural and Forestry Inspection Team toured the various prefectures of Zhangzhou, Quanzhou, and Xinghua, and is still staying in Fuzhou. This time, Taguchi Takashi came again. Furthermore, according to a Quanzhou report, on the 12th, Japanese Taguchi Hide accompanied Taiwanese Zheng Wanghui from the province to Quanzhou, saying that they would go to various places to sell medicines. On the 13th, they went to Anhai and Shishi. Recently, there have been foreigners of unknown origin coming and going in Quanzhou. (March 17)</p>

<h3>Consul-General to Singapore Petitions for Repair of Wan Qing Yuan</h3>
<p>—The Garden is a Revolutionary Site—</p>
<p>Singapore Dispatch. Wan Qing Yuan at No. 12, Teochew Bridge Road, Singapore, was the Singapore alliance site of the early Kuomintang organization, the Revive China Society, and also the Prime Minister's residence in the early days of his planning of the revolution in Singapore. At that time, this garden was rented from a Cantonese house owner by Singapore comrades. Now, the garden has been in disrepair for a long time, and all the roofs are almost completely decayed, and the wooden walls have also been broken. It is truly a wasteland of weeds, broken tiles, and ruined walls. However, the appearance still stands tall. The owner is about to order craftsmen to demolish the garden, which has been abandoned for a long time, and sell the broken tiles. Upon hearing the news, Gao Lingbai, the Consul-General to Singapore, thought that it was a revolutionary site, and how could it be demolished. He invited Zhang Rinnan and others, old comrades who had planned the revolution with the Prime Minister in the garden at that time, to get together. Zhang and others looked back on the past, and all of them were moved to tears and were willing to donate money to buy it. They immediately raised 5,100 yuan in national currency and bought it back from the owner. Now Consul-General Gao has telegraphed President Lin and Chairman Chiang of the National Government, requesting funds for repairs, and it will soon be completely renovated.</p>
<h3>Qingdao City Experiences Citywide Water Shortage</h3>
<p>City Government Urgently Seeks Relief Measures, and Has Determined Fundamental Steps</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Due to prolonged drought in Qingdao, water sources have dried up, and the city's drinking water supply is already struggling to meet demand. If this continues, it will become a serious problem. Mayor Shen Honglie previously ordered the waterworks and water source areas to quickly find emergency remedies. He also inspected the water source areas recently. Due to the lack of rain, the water shortage is increasingly severe, causing widespread panic among citizens. Shen, accompanied by Sun Bin, head of the waterworks, and Wang Zhaochen, the plant's chief engineer, went to inspect the various water source areas around 1 PM on the 13th to seek divine remedies. According to Shen, "During this time of year, rainfall has never been plentiful, but this year's drought is particularly severe, a phenomenon unseen in the last thirty years. The water level of Qingdao's water sources has been declining daily, while the city's population and the number of factories have increased sharply in recent years. The city uses about 15,000 tons of water per day. The city government has a comprehensive plan to fundamentally solve the current temporary water shortage. The current relief measures are nothing more than increasing supply and reducing consumption. The way to increase supply is to increase the amount of water from various sources. Currently, in addition to using the steam engines at various water sources, we are also carrying out well-digging projects in Zhangcun River, upstream of the Licun River Water Plant. This project will be completed in about 14 days, and it can supply about 1,500 tons of water per day. The well-digging project in Xiliuzhuang is also progressing actively and will be completed in about ten days, and it can supply about 1,000 tons of water per day. The Huangbu to Baisha River water source area will also start construction today, and although tomorrow is a Sunday holiday, we will still recruit workers to carry out the project. It is expected to be completed in early April. The water volume there is greater than the other two places, and it can supply about 5,000 tons of water per day. It is estimated that the current shortage in the city is about 1,000 tons. After the completion of the above three projects, there should be no shortage of drinking water in the city. As for the method of reducing consumption, the competent authorities are now consulting with various factories and businesses to save as much as possible. At the same time, it is also hoped that users will not waste drinking water, which will also help in reducing consumption."</p>
<p>Regarding the cause of the water shortage, the person in charge of the waterworks said, "Since a heavy rain fell at the end of July last year, more than eight months have passed without heavy rain, causing the water source to dry up and causing panic. In the past, the average daily output was more than 17,000 tons, but now it is only more than 15,000 tons, which is more than 2,000 tons less than in the past. This is the main reason for the water shortage. In recent years, large-scale factories in the city have been expanding, and the number of newly established factories is also very large. According to current calculations, the large factories in the urban area, such as Suzuki, Gongda, Toyota, Tongyu, Huaxin, and other twenty factories, account for about 50% of the total water consumption in the city. This is also one of the reasons for the water shortage. Other reasons, such as the continuous increase in the number of users and the increasing consumption, are also related."</p>
<p>As for the relief measures, the following have been decided: ㊀ The city's water sources originally had five locations: the east and west Licun plants, Haibo River, Baisha River, and Machang. We have tried our best to store water to meet emergency needs. We are also collecting water flow and digging wells for emergency relief in Xiliuzhuang, Zhangcun River, and other places. This project can be completed in a few days. These two places can produce about 3,500 tons of water per day, which can make up for the current shortage. ㊁ The largest consumers of water in the city are the major factories. The Social Affairs Bureau and the Waterworks have convened responsible persons from various factories to discuss relief measures. From now on, within the possible range, all factories should save as much as possible. ㊂ From now on, all ships sailing from this port to Dalian are not allowed to load water in the city. ㊃ The Waterworks has ordered all water spigots in the city to be fully opened, and people can draw water freely every day. It also notified citizens to try their best to save water and not to waste it.</p>
<p>The city's waterworks feels that the amount of water from the existing water sources is not enough for the city's supply. It originally planned to build a dam at Yuezikou to store water as a fundamental plan. However, the entire construction cost of this dam project is about more than 6 million yuan, which is a large amount. The financial resources are temporarily insufficient, so a step-by-step approach is proposed. The first step is to drill wells and set up a factory in Huangbu, which is close to Yuezikou. The Huangbu will set up a water tower and pipe to Sifang Beiling. A reservoir will be built in Beiling to distribute the water volume. According to statistics, this plan includes ㊀ drilling 40 wells, ㊁ 5,000 meters of water intake pipes in the river, ㊂ building an office and dormitory, four water pumps, water meters, and other equipment, ㊄ adding 20,000 meters of 650 mm diameter water pipes, ㊅ a reservoir, ㊆ water distribution pipes: 3,000 meters in Zhan Shan, 5,000 meters in Taitung Town, 4,000 meters in the Sifang dangerous industrial zone, and 3,000 meters in Cangkou. The above items require a total of more than 2 million yuan. After the completion of this project, it can increase the water supply by more than 10,000 tons per day. In the future, after the completion of the second step of the dam construction project, it can increase the water volume by more than 10,000 tons per day.</p>

<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Household Registration Police Harass Good Citizens</p>
<p>Gui Gang, a household registration police officer in the third district of this county, suddenly went to the district to arrest Wang Dusheng, a villager, under the pretext of collecting taxes. He beat him severely and escorted him to the Pailou Market before showing a warrant for Wang Zengye and Duji, who owed taxes from the 22nd capital and eighth figure in the 23rd year. Wang said that the land tax had been paid at the designated Second District Office and held the Tai character No. 69 receipt. He went to the county government to exchange it for a new receipt but had not received it. The police then released Wang Dusheng. Wang was unwilling to be beaten and humiliated, so he presented the photo taken when he was insulted to the provincial government. The provincial government asked why the land tax had been paid but the receipt had not been exchanged. They asked the county to investigate whether there was any double taxation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Thoroughly Register Private Schools</p>
<p>According to the investigation, there are quite a few private schools in this county. Now, in order to thoroughly improve them, the Education Bureau has organized registration, which is scheduled to end in March.

Those with excellent results will be given bonuses by the Education Bureau. After this registration, if unregistered schools are found, they will be ordered to close down and will not be tolerated.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>West Section of Huan Shan Road to be Built Slowly</p>
<p>The Huan Shan Road is being built in this county. Currently, the road base from Hanbeidou, Jingdianfu, Sanfeng, Ludian to Jiaoxiang has been completed by the Zhaiciguteng and Yuzhen laborers. Now, the section close to the west mountain has many ancient tombs, including those of Qian Muqi, Wang Shigu, Huang Dachi, Weng Tonghe, and national hero Wang Tie. Moreover, the destruction of farmland and houses is also a great sacrifice. After the request of local people, it was decided to change the road and widen the original mountain road. The conscription of laborers will be carried out along the mountain. The Zhuangding of Shangqian Town are all bricklayers and carpenters. If they are conscripted to build roads, the road widening and house building projects in the city will inevitably be delayed. Therefore, the Construction Committee has decided to extend the construction period of the West Mountain Road by one month.</p>

<h3>Kang Ti Tennis Club Seeks Sponsorship Members This Season</h3>
<p>In Order to Achieve Economic Stability</p>
<p>Organizing the Courts and Preparing to Open</p>
<p>The Kang Ti Road grass tennis court in this port has improved its club affairs and achieved remarkable results since the Sports Association and the Chinese Sports Association jointly took over it last year. The tennis season is approaching, and the authorities discussed the matter a few days ago and decided to reorganize the organization and management this season to make the court the only complete grass tennis court for Shanghai people. The details are described below:</p>
<p>Last Year's Financial Situation</p>
<p>It was found that the Sports Association and the Chinese Sports Association took over the court last year because they could not bear to see it abandoned. Each allocated 1,000 yuan as a takeover fee. After a year of operation, although the court has been completely renovated and the club affairs are booming, the financial situation is extremely difficult. In total, during the past year, due to the payment of construction and land rent and other fees, in addition to the takeover fee of 2,000 yuan, all of it has been used up, and there is a deficit of several hundred yuan. If it continues to be run this year, the persons concerned feel quite courageous.</p>

<p>In the past, the economic source of the court was entirely based on the membership fees paid by the members to maintain it. However, due to the small income, it was felt that it was not enough. Therefore, if no other way is found, it will be difficult to continue to maintain it. For this reason, this season, special sponsorship members have been added, and it is planned to have enthusiastic sports people from all walks of life to take on the role. It is estimated that each sponsorship member will pay a fee of 100 yuan, in order to use this income to inject funds, so that the foundation of the court can be stabilized and there is no risk of interruption.</p>
<p>The Courts are Heavily Reorganized</p>
<p>It is learned that Sun Yaodong, an old member of the association, is very concerned about the situation in the association and will rise up to sponsor and will also recruit sponsorship members on his behalf. The persons in charge of the two associations are also proceeding separately. It is hoped that enthusiastic sports people from all walks of life will act bravely and enthusiastically sponsor, so that the court can continue to be maintained. It is also heard that the court will greatly reorganize the court affairs and management methods, and the detailed situation will be announced later.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Rewards Excellent Private Schools with Improved Practices Throughout the Province</h3>
<p>Regulations Change to Standards of Substitute Elementary Schools</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Education Department believes that improving private school facilities and enriching private school content is sufficient to make up for the shortcomings of school education and promote the completion of compulsory education. The central government has regarded this work as an important task. The department has previously issued various measures for improving private schools and ordered compliance. So far, after examining the general situation of private schools in the past, due to little guidance and lack of funding, most have not actively improved. However, there are indeed many who have worked hard to innovate and have achieved excellent results. These excellent private schools should be shown standards and evaluated, so as to move into the normal track of school education. At the same time, subsidize their expenses to make the content more perfect. As for private schools that are not well-managed, they should be actively guided first and should not be banned hastily. It is necessary to ensure that all private schools in various places are improved in stages as the stage of compulsory education is implemented, so as to complete the mission of universal compulsory education. The "Provisional Standards for Excellent Private Schools to be Changed into Substitute Elementary Schools in Various Counties and Cities", the "Provisional Measures for Subsidizing Excellent Private Schools and Substitute Elementary School Expenses in Various Counties and Cities", and the "Measures for Central Elementary Schools to Guide Private Schools in Various Counties and Cities" have been re-ordered as benchmarks for improvement, which have been ordered to be complied with by the county governments.</p>

When the initial reform cannot fully comply with the provisions of the above article, at least there should be three subjects: national language, common sense, and arithmetic; in addition, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, such as the optional teaching of other supplementary courses, and letters and various application texts, etc., are not prohibited, but the textbooks used must be suitable for the student's level and the trend of the times as the standard;) 3. The teaching methods can earnestly research and improve the class system, have appropriate coordination, and in terms of moral education, can conscientiously implement the civic training standards promulgated by the Ministry and the ban on corporal punishment issued by the department.</p>

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to the Public Works Department Requesting No Fault-Finding with Schools</h3>
<p>Considering Facts and Law</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department yesterday, stating: "Sir, according to a letter from the Daozhong Girls' Middle School, our school recently received two letters from the Public Works Department, stating that for fire safety reasons, we are required to immediately rebuild properly enclosed standard staircases or install two new staircases within two months, and remove all the other six staircases, and also ordered to submit drawings for approval before implementation, otherwise subsidies will be permanently cancelled, etc. Such unwarranted fault-finding forgets the established facts and acts as if interfering with retroactive laws, disregarding the difficulties of school operators and the motivation of the Public Works Department in providing subsidies. We truly do not understand the intention of the fire personnel, which is truly profound and unfathomable. From our research, all fault-finding can be disguised with plausible theories to deceive people. Therefore, the British people strongly oppose retroactive laws, and in law, there is an iron principle of non-retroactivity. Although the Public Works Department fire personnel are aware of this, we do not wish to discuss legal principles and established facts. However, for the sake of education and the assumed good intentions of the fire personnel, the estimated cost of reconstruction is about four thousand yuan (previously estimated at one to two thousand yuan, but according to current engineers, the required funds are as stated above). If the Public Works Department provides a subsidy, we would be happy to do so, and it would show that the Public Works Department truly values education." The matter has been reported to the Association, and we hereby write to your department, requesting that you consider the facts and legal principles to avoid deviating from the motivation for subsidies.</p>
<h3>Social Bureau Notifies Middle and Primary Schools to Pay Hygiene Fees by Deadline</h3>
<p>Payment Due by the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau issued an order to municipal middle and primary schools, stating: "It has been found that the Shanghai Municipal Health Education Committee previously sent a letter requesting that all schools uniformly collect hygiene fees starting from this semester, and this Bureau has already forwarded instructions for compliance. It is now found that two months have passed since the start of this semester, and the hygiene fees have not been reported and paid, which is highly inappropriate. In addition to separate orders, we hereby order the schools to comply and remit the hygiene fees collected, including those already collected from the last semester, to the Bureau by the end of March without delay. This order is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Vice President Kong Invited Mingxian School Directors to a Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 17th Dispatch) As the founder of Mingxian School in Taigu, Shanxi, Vice President Kong invited the school's Chinese and foreign directors to a meeting at his residence yesterday afternoon to discuss school affairs. At 4:30 PM, he received Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Spilevanik at his residence.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association Holds Its 4th Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>On the 28th of This Month at the YMCA</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association has been established for four years and has made outstanding achievements in promoting educational films in the city, such as screening educational films in schools on a rotating basis each semester. As the term of the third board of directors and supervisors has expired, the fourth annual meeting will be held at the YMCA in Baxianqiao starting on the morning of the 28th of this month to discuss association affairs and elect new officers. The Nanjing headquarters will also send personnel to provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Normal Schools to Emphasize Statistics</h3>
<p>Preparing to Improve Education Statistics Work</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued a notice to the education bureaus of all provinces and cities on the 16th, stating: "Investigating how education can be improved depends on the representation of statistical figures. Therefore, statistical work is extremely important. Considering the current educational statistical work, the most difficult part is the local education departments in counties and cities. Although there are those who conscientiously handle it, the majority are perfunctory. The reason is that most educators have not fully recognized the significance of statistical work and understood the methods of handling statistics. To improve this situation, in addition to providing guidance by educational administrative organs at any time and place, we should also fundamentally seek remedial measures. Normal schools are places for training primary school teachers and local education administrators. To improve local education statistical work in the future, we must first provide sufficient and appropriate training to current normal school students of all types. All types of normal schools have subjects such as primary school administration, education testing, and statistics. When teachers teach these subjects, they should not only explain the theory of statistics but also practice practical matters. This practice should not only be about applying various formulas but also about registering and organizing basic materials. It is necessary to ensure that all handled matters are first registered and organized in detail before various formulas can be used to indicate various relationships; otherwise, errors will inevitably occur. Students must also first develop the habit of accurately registering materials so that they can be competent and happy when serving. To achieve this goal, the following two measures are specifically formulated: 1. When teaching statistics, more emphasis should be placed on practice. The statistical work of each normal school should be guided by teachers to allow students to participate or assist as much as possible within the scope of possibility. Those with affiliated primary schools should make full use of opportunities to verify and become proficient. 2. When teaching statistics, matters that should be handled or reported in the primary school regulations promulgated by the Ministry and the Statistics Law and its Implementation Rules promulgated by the National Government should be explained in detail so that they have a deep understanding of the system of current statistical work and the important matters of education statistics. The above two items are related to the future of local education administration and are extremely important. Please instruct all types of normal schools under your jurisdiction to strictly comply to achieve results. This order."</p>
<h3>Private School Association Held Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Refuting the Public Works Department's Letter</p>
<p>Holding a General Meeting in the Shortest Possible Time</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Private School Association held its sixth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the association's office at 4 PM yesterday. The attendees included Cui Jianwu, Hu Shuyi, Chen Jicheng, Feng Yixian, Zhang Lingfei, Sun Yucai, Ge Youren, Lin Zhengong, Feng Dafu, Tang Zengyun, Li Guixiong, Yu Shenzhai, Qi Juechen, and Wang Baochang, among others. Feng Yixian chaired the meeting, and Sun Yucai recorded the minutes. The chairman first reported on the association's affairs, stating that the work in the association is intense and it is planned to hire one Chinese and one Western secretary each starting next week to facilitate the work. Subsequently, the following resolutions were passed: (1) To convene a general meeting in the shortest possible time to report on the association's affairs and discuss future plans; (2) To set the regular meeting time from 5 to 6 PM every day, extending it by a maximum of one hour; (3) The Public Works Department's deadline for renovation was refuted because the reasons were not justified. It is now learned that the original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Refuting the Original Letter: Sir, according to reports from various members, the Public Works Department sent a letter dated February 9th, signed by Director He De Kui, stating, "It has been found that most schools subsidized by this Bureau are in unsuitable buildings that are prone to fire hazards. After consideration, this Bureau has formulated measures, instructing the schools to quickly improve within three months after receiving the letter, otherwise subsidies will be permanently cancelled. This is hereby notified." According to the association, before the subsidies began, the facilities of each subsidized school had been deemed satisfactory by the Public Works Department. Now, they are suddenly referred to as prone to fire hazards, which is intentionally demanding. As for the measures of quickly improving within three months, otherwise subsidies will be permanently cancelled, it is even more difficult to accept and cannot be acknowledged. We hope that you will negotiate to cancel these measures. According to this, after investigating, the facilities of all schools under this association were indeed surveyed by your bureau multiple times before the subsidies began and were deemed satisfactory. The schools have been safe and sound, and no accidents have occurred. Now that the number of students in each school remains the same and the facilities remain the same, your bureau suddenly deems them prone to fire hazards and threatens to permanently cancel subsidies, which is truly perplexing. If the buildings are truly prone to fire hazards and cannot be subsidized, then your bureau's past subsidies were a mistake. If they can be applied, then the formulated measures are demanding. One of the two must be true. We ask your bureau to clarify. Furthermore, Chinese and foreign laws are not retroactive. Therefore, this association considers this notification from your bureau to be "retroactive law" and difficult to acknowledge. We hope that you will cancel it immediately."</p>
<h3>This Year's Puppet Binjiang Province Expands Enslavement Education</h3>
<p>Adding Over 300 Classes in 26 Counties and Banners</p>
<p>Recruiting Over 14,400 New Students</p>
<p>(Northeast News Agency, Harbin Dispatch) The education department of the puppet Binjiang Provincial Government, following the instructions of the Japanese and the puppet Ministry of Education, is thoroughly promoting the enslavement education of the masses in various counties and banners under its jurisdiction. The results of the anesthetic education implemented last year were good and were praised by the Japanese puppet Ministry of Education. Therefore, starting from the new year this year, the implementation of enslavement education will be further expanded to further please the Japanese so that the Chinese traitors who handle anesthetic education can permanently maintain their high offices and generous salaries. As for the plan being implemented, this year, in the 27 counties and one banner under its jurisdiction, except for the two counties of Tieli and Zhaoganhe, which are limited by local conditions and funding and will not be added beyond the original number, the remaining 26 counties and banners will add a total of 318 classes and recruit 14,432 new students. The county-specific details and number of students are listed as follows:</p>

<h3>Kodama and Others Arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday Morning</h3>

<p>Chairman Delivers Speech During the banquet, Chairman Zhou Zuomin delivered a welcome speech, saying, "It is a great honor tonight to have Chairman Kodama, Ambassador Xu, Mayor Wu, and leaders from various political, business, educational, and personal connections from China and Japan present. On behalf of all members of this association, I would like to express my sincere gratitude and welcome. Especially to Chairman Kodama and all the members who have come from afar, we are very fortunate. However, due to the short notice and the large number of guests, there may be some shortcomings in the arrangements, and the food and wine may not be exquisite enough, or the seating may not be appropriate. We apologize deeply and ask for your forgiveness. The year before last, the Chinese Economic Delegation visited Japan and received warm hospitality from the Japanese government and people. We have not forgotten this to this day. On behalf of my colleagues, I would like to express my gratitude to Chairman Kodama and the Japanese members. Since the beginning of this new year, we have been pleased to hear many opinions from the Japanese government and people regarding the improvement of Sino-Japanese relations. Recently, the diplomatic authorities of both countries have also solemnly declared that relations between the two countries should be based on the principle of mutual equality and mutual benefit. Chairman Kodama and the Japanese members have prestige and power in the economic circles of friendly countries, and it is fitting that they should come to China at this time, which is a harbinger of the improvement of relations between the two countries. This is a matter of great joy to our association and should be a cause for comfort to the people of your country. The aim of our association is to promote the development of trade between the two countries. The development of trade between the two countries depends on the development of the economies of both countries and the harmony of the feelings of the people of both countries. Today, I would like to express my feelings, and I hope you will correct me. China and Japan have close geographical, historical, racial, and cultural ties. These relationships are all natural and cannot be created by human power. Therefore, the people of the two countries should have feelings like those of brothers. The economies of the two countries should also have considerable development based on this natural relationship. However, the actual situation is not as we imagined, and the feelings of the people are not harmonious, and the economic development is not smooth. The facts are clear and cannot be denied. The root cause is that political obstacles occur from time to time. To break this deadlock, we must first find ways to eliminate these obstacles before there is a path to follow. Politics and economics are closely linked. In the current political environment, the two countries have made efforts in economic cooperation, and there have been many discussions on all sides, believing that the development of the economies of the two countries is mutually beneficial. This insightful view is often shared by people of insight on both sides. However, some say that the maintenance and acquisition of economic rights and interests should be backed by strength, or that cooperation can be used as a means, or that economic cooperation should be based on the premise that its main body can survive. These arguments are based on different positions and different interests, so there are inconsistent views. We firmly believe that if we want to achieve true economic cooperation between the two countries today, the people of both countries must first have a far-sighted new understanding. If this new understanding can become a reflection of public opinion and national policy in both countries, then the permanent foundation of cooperation can be established. The far-sighted new understanding we are talking about is whether the people of both countries should carefully examine the current world situation and the national conditions of both countries and their respective positions, and mutually recognize the national consciousness of the other party. To put it bluntly, the phrase 'coexistence and co-prosperity' has long become a cliché, but in the current period, the meaning of coexistence and co-prosperity needs to be examined more deeply. That is, whether the happiness of the two countries depends on the stability of East Asia, and whether the stability of East Asia depends on the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries. If a part of the people insist on their own survival and prosperity, can it be enough for the permanent happiness of their nation? If not, then the conditions for mutual survival and prosperity must be respected, and the realization of these conditions must be understood and assisted. All past and present situations should be reviewed based on new understandings, and corrections should be made within the necessary range. Only then can the knots between the two major ethnic groups be completely harmonized, and true cooperation can be achieved here. This is what we firmly believe. If the people of both countries share this belief, we deeply hope that we will work together to realize it. Chairman Kodama and his colleagues are extremely concerned about the relationship between the two countries. Especially Chairman Kodama's recent remarks are extremely precise, and we deeply admire them. The results of your inspection this time will surely benefit the relations between the two countries and the feelings of the people. Recalling that since the establishment of this association, due to the poor environment, we have made no progress and are extremely ashamed. This first general meeting is honored by the presence of Chairman Kodama and the members, and we should seize this opportunity to open our hearts and discuss practically how to help eliminate the obstacles between the two countries, how to harmonize the feelings of the people of the two countries, and how to develop trade to fulfill the mission of this association and live up to the expectations of all parties in both countries. All of you present tonight are the most authoritative people in all circles of the two countries. We earnestly hope that you will give this association as much guidance as possible so that we can act as a guide. With this humble wine, I would like to express my respect and wish you all good health."</p>
<p>Kodama's Reply Chairman Kodama then delivered a reply, saying, "We arrived in Shanghai on the 14th and went to Nanjing, and returned here this afternoon. We are deeply grateful to Chairman Chiang and the government authorities in Nanjing for their cordial reception. Today, the China-Japan Trade Association is hosting such a grand banquet for our group and giving us the opportunity to meet with local influential people. We are especially grateful. We have made considerable efforts to increase the friendship between China and Japan and to strengthen the economic interdependence between the two countries. The organization of a trade association last year with the cooperation of influential people in the economic circles of your country was also the first step towards realizing this expectation. However, as Chairman Zhou has stated, if relations between the two countries cannot be developed, and if the feelings of the people are not cautious, there may be a tendency towards confrontation. It is regrettable that our efforts cannot achieve the desired effect. This time, the Trade Association is holding its first general meeting in Shanghai, and we are very pleased to be able to meet with old friends and other influential people in the financial world. We are even more pleased that this opportunity will allow us to exchange opinions frankly, increase mutual understanding, and strengthen the foundation of economic cooperation. We sincerely hope that the unpleasant state of affairs in the two countries will clear up immediately and that the relations between the two countries will be stabilized again. We firmly believe that this is a matter of urgency. To promote friendly relations between the two countries, we must first communicate the will of the people of both countries and make them blend together. Secondly, all confrontational, suspicious, and antagonistic concepts should be eliminated. We must respect each other and trust each other. We firmly believe that this is very important. What we hope for, as Chairman Zhou has just said, is that the two countries will maintain friendly relations as good neighbors and brothers, cooperate with each other, and achieve peace and prosperity in the East. Economically speaking, under the principle of mutual benefit and equality, we should have relevance and make the relationship of mutual dependence increasingly close. On the one hand, if we forcibly sacrifice the interests of the other party to carry out economic cooperation, we believe that it should be thoroughly rejected. If there are any misunderstandings about the above points, we hope that they can be fundamentally eliminated, and we also hope that all influential people will work together to do so. In recent years, there have been many political problems between the two countries, and even times when diplomatic relations have been in danger. This phenomenon is of course not easy to solve, but we believe that it lacks the spirit of 'loyalty and forgiveness,' and we think that there is a need for reflection. If we can understand and trust each other at this time, eliminate the misunderstandings of the past, respect each other, and work together to achieve peace and prosperity in the East, and fulfill the fundamental mission of the two countries, this is the responsibility of the people of both countries. Recently, your country has made obvious progress in politics and economy, which is very gratifying. We would like to express our deep respect for these efforts. We will not hesitate to provide assistance to your country's efforts. I dare to tell you this. We are very grateful for your warm hospitality. I would like to offer a toast to your health." Finally, the Chinese band played music to add to the fun. The guests and hosts dispersed happily at about 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Traditional Chinese Medicine Community Commemorates "March 17th" National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day</h3>
<p>Celebration and Commemoration Meeting Held Yesterday, Party and Government Representatives Sent to Deliver Speeches, Donation of a Percentage of Profits to Assist in the Construction of the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Museum</p>
<p>Yesterday was "March 17th" National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day. Professionals in the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries in Shanghai held a celebration and commemoration meeting at the Lake Society. Attendees included Zhang Zhongyu, representative of Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Museum; Mao Yun, representative of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Committee; Tao Ji'an, representative of the Health Bureau; as well as members of the Shanghai Medical Association, the Chinese National Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, the Shenzhou National Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, the Chinese Pharmaceutical Industry Association, the Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, all staff members of the Shanghai Branch of the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Museum, and students from various traditional Chinese medicine schools, totaling over one thousand people.</p>
<p>Meeting Officials The presidium consisted of Shen Zhongfang, Ding Jiwan, Gu Weichuan, Shi Jiqun, and Qiu Yanling. The secretaries were Cheng Diren, He Yunsheng, and Tang Jifu. The recorders were Wu Quji, Ni Xi'an, and Fei Shuizuo. Zhu Song served as the master of ceremonies.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report After the formalities, Chairman Shen Zhongfang delivered an opening speech, briefly stating, "Today is 'March 17th' National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day. Our traditional Chinese medicine community has specially united to hold the third commemoration meeting. It is a great honor to have you all here. Everyone present must be aware of the history of 'March 17th,' so I don't need to say much. The significance of holding this commemoration is explained in detail in the special issue published today, which contains many articles written by people in the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries. Please refer to it for clarification. I am honored to attend this grand meeting and have boundless hopes in my heart. I can only say a few simple words: First, we must unite; second, we must strive forward. Although this is old news, if we want to revive traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceuticals, we must start here. Due to time constraints, I will have to ask representatives from party and government agencies and guests from various sectors to speak. Please forgive me, and I hope you will all understand."</p>
<p>Party and Government Speeches Following the Chairman's report, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Committee, delivered a speech, briefly stating, "I have attended previous grand meetings held by your industry and have always seen a thriving atmosphere. This meeting is particularly enthusiastic. This is truly a good phenomenon for the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries, and it is the glory of the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries. The spirit of struggle of your colleagues over the years is deeply admirable. Not only has it made the government pay more attention to your esteemed industry, but it has also gained the sympathy of the general public. I hope that your colleagues will work harder to promote the quintessence of Chinese culture." Then, Tao Ji'an, representative of the Municipal Health Bureau, delivered a speech, briefly stating, "I am very pleased to attend the third National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day commemoration meeting held by your industry today. Traditional Chinese medicine has its own strengths and has a deep relationship with the nation and the people. Therefore, I hope that the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries will be able to learn from the strengths of others, make up for their own shortcomings, and strive for progress based on the spirit of modern science, so that they can benefit society in no small way."</p>
<p>Chairman's Reply Finally, Chairman Shen Zhongfang delivered a reply, briefly stating, "Today, the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries have jointly held the National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day commemoration meeting. We are deeply grateful for the encouragement from representatives of party and government agencies and guests from all sectors. I hereby give this reply." The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>Donations for Commemoration The traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical colleagues in Shanghai, in order to celebrate National Traditional Chinese Medicine Day and consolidate the foundation of the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industry, donated a percentage of their entire day's business income and consultation fees to the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Museum for the construction of the museum's buildings and the strengthening of its internal equipment.</p>
<p>Director Jiao's Speech Zhang Zhongyu, representative of Jiao Yitang, Director of the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Museum, delivered a speech, briefly stating, "It is a great honor for me to represent Director Jiao at your meeting today. In recent years, the efforts of colleagues in the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries have allowed traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine to be treated equally. The passage of the Traditional Chinese Medicine Regulations by the Legislative Yuan has provided a solid legal basis for the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries. In the future, in order to improve itself, the traditional Chinese medicine and pharmaceutical industries should establish traditional Chinese medicine schools and strive to improve the traditional Chinese medicine industry. It is also hoped that the government will add traditional Chinese medicine to medical and health institutions. The recent establishment of a traditional Chinese medicine committee in the Ministry of Health is of great importance to the future of traditional Chinese medicine. In the future, under the guidance of the government, China's medical community will be able to make greater progress. I recall that in recent years, advanced countries have paid attention to the traditional Chinese medicine industry. For example, the Heath Belt and circulation invented in France are based on the same principles as acupuncture in Chinese medicine. The American newspaper in San Francisco reported that in the United States, there are very dangerous diseases that have been cured by traditional Chinese medicine, so it praised traditional Chinese medicine in particular. The Soviet Union has now established the Oriental Medicine Research Association, which specializes in the study of the theory of traditional Chinese medicine. Japan has established a Chinese medicine lecture and has Imai Kyoun, President of the Ohone Kampo Medical College, and Hiki Okisaburo, Professor of the Great Emperor of Japan, specially come to China to investigate the traditional Chinese medicine industry. All of this proves that traditional Chinese medicine has an indelible value. In other places such as North Borneo, the Philippines, Siam, Annam, the United States, San Francisco, Batavia, and Surabaya, the traditional Chinese medicine industry is very prosperous. Therefore, I deeply hope that the Chinese medical and pharmaceutical communities will rise up and strive to bring glory to the industry and seek happiness for mankind."</p>

<h3>The Yugu Village Case Was Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>Temporarily Under the Guise of Remuneration Fees; Resolving the Issue Through Re-Negotiation; All Obstacles Were Removed Yesterday</p>
<p>Regarding the dispute arising from the refusal of residents of Yugu Village to pay property taxes, the solution has been agreed upon by Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government and President Feiyi of the Public Works Bureau. Details were reported yesterday. Secretary-General Lun met with representatives of the homeowners yesterday and continued negotiations with President Feiyi. When the board of directors of the Public Works Bureau held a meeting, the Chinese director also raised questions. Ye Shaoying, a resident of the village, also filed a lawsuit with the consular corps. From 4:00 PM yesterday, the Public Works Bureau began to remove various obstacles, and the issue came to an end. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yu Called on Representatives of Property Owners: In order to quickly resolve the issue, Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government specially summoned Lu Dingkui, a lawyer representing the owners of Yugu Village, at noon yesterday to inquire about his opinions on the matter, and informed him that the Municipal Government was extremely concerned about the case and should resolve it quickly. Lawyer Lu explained the course of the case and the current opposition of most tenants to the Public Works Bureau's collection of police tax, and requested that the Municipal Government directly collect the property tax from the tenants, which could be resolved smoothly.</p>
<p>Continued Negotiations to Re-Establish Measures: Secretary-General Yu, upon the instruction of Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon, continued negotiations with Arnold, the Director-General, and Feixin, the President, of the Public Works Bureau, and re-established the following measures: ㊀ The Public Works Bureau will remove the obstacles and connect the ditches, sewers, etc. within a time limit to restore the original state. ㊁ The Municipal Government guarantees that the residents of Yugu Village, having enjoyed the benefits of roads, ditches, sewers, etc. laid by the Public Works Bureau, will pay the Public Works Bureau a remuneration fee equal to the amount of property tax in the spring of this year in the future. ㊂ The Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau will immediately negotiate the issue of road construction beyond the boundary, and if necessary, find a reasonable partial solution to the property tax issue first. ㊃ If the negotiations yield results, the remuneration fee guaranteed by the Municipal Government to be paid by the residents of Yugu Village will be handled in accordance with the method agreed upon in the future. If the negotiations break down, the Municipal Government will pay the remuneration fee to the Public Works Bureau in accordance with Article 2 of this method.</p>
<p>Chinese Director Raised Strict Questions: At the regular meeting of the board of directors of the Public Works Bureau yesterday, the issue was reported by the Director-General. After the report was completed, Chinese Director Xi Yushu raised questions, stating that this kind of disposal lacked legal basis and endangered the lives of the residents of the village. Xi gave an example to illustrate that if a fire broke out in the village, and the fire truck could not enter because the village gate was tightly closed, would they sit idly by and watch the village be destroyed? However, since Yu and Fei had negotiated a solution, the Director-General only stated the process of the resolved issue.</p>
<p>Resident Representative Filed a Complaint: Ye Shaoying, a lawyer and resident of the village, had previously filed a lawsuit with the consular corps, requesting that the consular corps immediately correct this erroneous act of the Public Works Bureau and ensure that similar incidents would not occur in the future. At the same time, Ye stated in the complaint that he reserved the right to claim compensation from the Public Works Bureau for all losses incurred as a result of this incident.</p>
<p>All Obstacles Were Removed Yesterday: This case had been delayed for a week. Through the negotiations between Secretary-General Yu of the Municipal Government and the authorities of the Public Works Bureau, as well as protests and opposition from various parties, the Public Works Bureau ordered workers to go to the village at 4:00 PM yesterday and completely remove all obstacles to the iron gates leading to Difeng Road, Daxilu Road, and Yuyuan Road, and open up the ditches and sewers to restore the original state. The case can be said to have come to an end.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Land Administration Bureau Was Reorganized and Established</h3>
<p>Seal of Office Put Into Use Today</p>
<p>Since receiving the order to promulgate the Land Law and the Outline of Land Administration Procedures for Various Provinces and Cities, the Municipal Land Bureau has been preparing for the reorganization of the Land Administration Bureau in compliance with the order. All procedures have been completed, and a request has been submitted for the issuance of the Land Administration Bureau's seal of office in order to reorganize and put it into use on a regular basis. It is now heard that the new seal of the bureau has been issued and will be put into use on the 18th of this month. From that day on, it will be renamed the Land Administration Bureau, and reports have been submitted separately, letters have been sent to various agencies, and a notice has been issued to the people of this city for their information. The notice is recorded as follows: Notice of the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau: In accordance with the instruction No. 22736 of the Municipal Government, the Ministry of Internal Affairs has approved the order of the Executive Yuan to issue the seal of office of the Shanghai Municipal Land Administration Bureau, ordering immediate reorganization and implementation, etc. Upon receiving this, the Director of this Bureau will use the new seal on the 18th of this month.

<h3>Handicrafts Will Be Shipped to Beijing for Exhibition Early Next Month</h3>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Circles Should Send Them to the Collection Point as Soon as Possible</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received orders to collect various handicrafts from the industrial and commercial circles in this city to participate in the National Handicraft Exhibition held in Beijing. However, since the collection began, the number of applicants has not been enthusiastic. According to Wu Huanru, the chief of the Second Section of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, to a reporter from the Central News Agency, the National Handicraft Exhibition held in Beijing this time will feature the finest products selected from all over the country. Although China's industry has gradually made progress towards mechanization, the domestic handicraft industry is still very developed and enjoys a great reputation. For example, the lacquerware of Fujian, the pottery of Yixing in Jiangsu, the porcelain of Jiangxi, and the embroidery of Hunan are all extremely precious. Therefore, there will definitely be a grand occasion at that time. Although this city is an industrial center, most of its products are machine-made, and it seems to be inferior to other places in terms of handicrafts. Therefore, since the collection began, the number of applicants from all parties has not been enthusiastic. However, the scope of this collection is extremely broad. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has sent personnel to contact various parties to select various handicrafts with greater value, and plans to collect and send them to Beijing early next month. It is also hoped that various handicraft manufacturers can send various products to the collection point for shipment to Beijing as soon as possible for publicity.</p>

<h3>The Disaster Situation in Sichuan Is Becoming Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>Fellow Villagers' Representatives Petition in Beijing</p>
<p>Since autumn last year, Sichuan has not had rain for more than half a year, and the disaster situation is becoming increasingly serious. According to a telegram from the Sichuan Provincial Government to the Executive Yuan, in addition to the 38 counties affected by floods in the summer, as many as 93 counties have been affected by drought. Sichuan has a total of 148 counties, and only more than 10 counties have not been affected. Currently, the ponds and dams are dry, and drinking water is difficult to obtain. The disaster victims in the most severely affected counties have nothing to eat, not even the bark and roots of trees, and can only dig up white mud (commonly known as "fairy rice") to prolong their lives. Moreover, the spring famine has already formed, and rice is difficult to plant. Even this year's autumn harvest is hopeless. Tens of millions of disaster victims are wailing in the ravines, urgently hoping that the authorities will save their dying lives. A month ago, the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association here sent three representatives, Lü Yifeng, Mei Xinru, and Li Qingfan, to Beijing to petition. Now, the association has reconvened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and still sent the same three representatives on the 19th to Beijing for the second time to present a petition to the Central Government in conjunction with the Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing.</p>
<h3>Iranian Consul General in Shanghai Transferred to the Soviet Union</h3>

Zhao Tiezhang, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Jiaji, Secretary of the Municipal Government, and others went to the pier to see him off.</p>
<h3>Workers at Whiteaway, Laidlaw &amp; Co., Ltd. Requested Negotiations Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Portion of the Demands Were Resolved, With Four Articles Pending Mediation</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports: All the workers at the Whiteaway, Laidlaw &amp; Co., Ltd. candle factory on Rue Robert in Shanghai, seeking improved treatment, sent representatives to the factory on the 14th to submit ten demands, with a deadline of four days for a reply. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Majesson, the factory manager, replied to the workers, ordering them to send representatives to the Asia Company directly at 2:30 PM for negotiations. After deliberation, the workers sent three general representatives, Ma Junfang, Zhen Guo, and Liu Xiwun, to the meeting on time. They were received by Dannis, the manager of the Asia General Company. As a result of the negotiations: ㊀ A 10% wage increase was promised to be considered. ㊁ Pensions will be handled in accordance with the company's regulations. ㊂ ㊃ ㊄ ㊅ Were not approved. ㊆ A half-month bonus will be issued at the end of the year. ㊇ Medical expenses for injuries incurred on duty will be borne by the factory, in addition to a subsidy of three yuan per week. ㊈ Female workers will be granted one month of maternity leave and a subsidy of ten yuan. ㊉ Holiday pay will be handled in accordance with the Asia Company's regulations. The four articles ㊂ ㊃ ㊄ ㊅ will be re-mediated on Saturday.</p>
<h3>Workers at the China Underwear Factory Accepted Advice</h3>
<p>Resumed Work This Morning</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reports that more than 200 workers at the China Underwear Weaving and Dyeing Factory on Route Kahnaut in Shanghai, who went on strike seeking improved treatment, have resumed work in the factory this morning after being persuaded by Du Liang, a staff member sent by the Social Affairs Bureau. It is heard that the bureau has scheduled a meeting at 9:00 AM on the 18th to convene both labor and management for mediation in accordance with the law.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Organs Jointly Issued a Notice Yesterday Strictly Prohibiting Silk Weaving Workers From Striking</h3>
<p>Workers at Various Factories Resumed Work One After Another</p>
<p>Xin Sheng Zhi reports: The Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau jointly issued a notice: It has been found that workers have arbitrarily gone on strike and slowed down work, and this committee and bureau have jointly issued notices strictly prohibiting such actions on record. However, recently, workers in various silk weaving factories in this city have successively gone on strike under the pretext of demanding improved treatment, which is extremely inappropriate. At a time when the government is advocating economic construction, the recovery of industry and commerce has just begun to sprout. Workers should share the same boat and make extra efforts with a spirit of mutual assistance, so that production can be increased and the foundation can be consolidated. If the silk weaving workers have legitimate demands, they should negotiate frankly or apply to this bureau for mediation in accordance with the law. Such acts of coercion with strikes must have bad elements inciting them. It must be understood that the labor-management relationship is as close as lips and teeth, and the principle of a strong foundation and prosperous branches is very clear. If they delay and do not resume work, both sides will be hurt.

<h3>Recent Six-Month Statistics on China's Cotton Industry</h3>
<p>The China Cotton Mill Association officially released the following statistics on China's cotton industry for the past six months (July 1, 25th year to the end of December):</p>
<p>Spindles: In the past six months, the total number of spindles in the country was 5,071,122. At the end of June, 25th year, there were 5,010,039. In the second half of the 24th year, there were 4,952,826.</p>
<p>Shutdown Situation: ㊀ Number of shutdown spindles: 1,596,224 in the second half of the 25th year, 1,555,010 in the first half of the year, and 1,360,273 in the second half of the 24th year. ㊁ Average shutdown hours per spindle: 1,699 in the second half of the 25th year, 2,153 in the first half of the year, and 2,443 in the second half of the 24th year. ㊂ Total number of spindles shutdown weeks in half a year: 4.05 weeks in the second half of the 25th year, 5.06 weeks in the first half of the year, and 5.08 weeks in the second half of the 24th year. The shutdown rate of textile mills nationwide has gradually declined since reaching its highest number in the second half of the 24th year. It has decreased sharply by one week in the most recent six months. This is because the yarn sales were strong in the winter of the 25th year, and factories that had reduced or stopped work have resumed operations one after another.</p>
<p>Factory Use of Cotton: ㊀ Chinese cotton: 1,187,548 large bales in the second half of the 25th year (each bale weighs 500 pounds net, same below), 1,072,107 bales in the first half of the year, and 1,062,169 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊁ American cotton: 38,256 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 38,722 bales in the first half of the year, and 69,446 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊂ Indian cotton: 43,468 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 30,589 bales in the first half of the year, and 39,296 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊃ Egyptian cotton: 14,776 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 12,650 bales in the first half of the year, and 12,286 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊄ Other cotton: 9,352 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 1,279 bales in the first half of the year, and 2,036 bales in the second half of the 24th year. ㊅ Total: 1,293,400 bales in the second half of the 25th year, 1,155,347 bales in the first half of the year, and 1,185,233 bales in the second half of the 24th year. The total number of cotton sales and the number of Chinese cotton sales in textile mills in the most recent six months are the highest records in the past. This is due to the increase in spinning spindles, the small reduction in work rate, and the large increase in domestic cotton production. American cotton has been decreasing year by year since reaching its highest number in the 25th year. The sales volume in the most recent six months has almost approached the lowest number. Egyptian cotton has been increasing year by year. Due to the increasing number of fine yarn spinning, the sales cost of finer raw cotton has also increased. This kind of cotton is still lacking domestically.</p>
<p>Factory Cotton Stock: ㊀ Chinese cotton: 581,873 bales on January 1, 26th year, 343,472 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 332,574 bales on January 1. ㊁ American cotton: 10,121 bales on January 1, 26th year, 18,562 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 18,157 bales on January 1. ㊂ Indian cotton: 1,655 bales on January 1, 26th year, 24,240 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 4,858 bales on January 1. ㊃ Egyptian cotton: 4,930 bales on January 1, 26th year, 4,850 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 3,242 bales on January 1. ㊄ Other cotton: 1,706 bales on January 2, 26th year, 995 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 45 bales on January 1. ㊅ Total: 600,285 bales on January 1, 26th year, 392,127 bales on July 1, 25th year, and 358,876 bales on January 1. The factory stock of Chinese cotton has increased greatly recently due to the bumper domestic cotton production in the previous year and the increase in the number of factories opening.</p>

<h3>The Daughter-in-Law of the American Tobacco King's Honeymoon Trip Is About to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Times reports from the Foreign News Agency that Mrs. Duke, the world's richest bride and beauty, and her seventeen-year-old husband will arrive in Shanghai in the next few days. The Duke couple just married a few months ago, which caused a sensation in the social circles of the East Coast of the United States, and newspapers reported more. The groom's father is a tobacco king. At the time of the marriage, the groom's family strongly opposed it because the bride was only seventeen and the groom was not of marriageable age. Later, the groom insisted and finally held it as scheduled. At the same time, he temporarily suspended his studies at Harvard University and will probably continue to attend school around September of this year. The newlyweds have traveled to Hawaii and Japan and are now in Beiping and will come to Shanghai soon. They plan to go to Annam in the future, and there are many hunting equipment in their luggage, hoping to capture one or two tigers during the trip. They are accompanied by two loyal old servants.</p>
<h3>The Case of Refusing to Accept Deposit Receipt Was Found to Be Forged</h3>
<p>Plaintiff Chen Zhonghuang Becomes Defendant, Police File Charges of Forging Documents</p>
<p>Chen Zhonghuang, a native of Ningbo, 55 years old, lives at No. 4, East Seward Road. He used to be a sailor foreman on the Wanxiang ship of the Shanghai Erbei Company (the ship specializes in opening up Fujian, round trip once every seven days). Last winter, he extended his lawyer to sue Han Maotang, a native of Shaoxing (i.e., the former owner of Nanyang Wine Shop at No. 435, East Seward Road), in the civil court of the First Special District Court for two deposit receipts that were not accepted, ㊀ 3,000 yuan due on December 20 last year, ㊁ 1,500 yuan due on January 10 this year. During the hearing, it was because Han Maotang</p>
<p>Nanyang Wine Shop Sold the Shop to His Cousin Han Maosheng. Han himself lived in Shaoxing and had not been to Shanghai for a long time, so he was notified by public notice. On February 7 of this year, the trial continued. Han Maotang arrived in court with Lawyer Ding Shiba to review the case and observed that the seal on the receipt did not match the original seal and was a forged seal and denied having such a deposit. He requested the court to allow the two receipts to be taken to the fingerprint room of the Hongkou Police to take photos, enlarge them, and study them. After determining whether the upper and lower seals were the same, they would still be</p>
<p>Returned to File. As a result, the judge ruled that the court would not accept the case because the defendant Han Maotang refused to appear in court and transferred it to the Shaoxing Local Court for trial. Unexpectedly, the police took photos of the two receipts and notified Lawyer Ding after finding that the Nanyang Wine Shop seal and the handwriting of Han Maotang signed above and below were inconsistent and were forged. Ding went to Shaoxing to accompany Han Maotang to Shanghai and turned themselves in to the police station. Chinese detective Zhu Jiqiang and Western detective went to No. 4, East Seward Road to arrest Chen Zhonghuang without success. According to his son,</p>
<p>Now Goes to America Or Java, No Date for Return Home. Later, it was found that the Wanxiang ship had returned to Shanghai from Fujian and was docked at Dongjiadu Wharf in Nanshi. Therefore, at about 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, they boarded the ship with members of the water patrol police detective team, arrested him, brought him back to the police station for detention, and sent him to the Criminal Court No. 3 of the First Special District Court this morning. Judge Xiao Xiufen attended the court to examine the case. The lawyer of the Public Works Bureau, Zhang Tianyin, described the case and filed a public prosecution for</p>
<p>Forging Documents in Accordance with Articles ○1, 200, and 27 of the Criminal Law. According to Han Maotang, 59 years old, the Nanyang Hotel on East Seward Road was set up by me for as long as seven or eight years. In September last year, it was sold to my cousin Maosheng for more than 1,400 yuan. I did not know the defendant and did not give him a deposit of 4,500 yuan as stated in the two receipts. When questioned the defendant, he claimed that Han Maotang personally gave me the two deposit receipts and there was no forgery. Judge Xiao ruled to remand the defendant and change the date to summon witnesses and re-verify the two receipts after suspending the case.</p>
<h3>The Monsoon Suddenly Changed the Climate</h3>
<p>As if a Season Changed Overnight, The Wind Has Not Settled Down Since Yesterday</p>
<p>The monsoon in this port suddenly broke out the night before, and it was very violent, causing a sudden change in the weather. The situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>Monsoon Breaks Out: Since the 14th, the weather in this port has suddenly turned warm, especially the day before yesterday, when it was extremely hot. The temperature at noon rose to over 72 degrees, as if it were the early summer season. Laborers easily wore single brown clothes. There were still people who called for heat. By the time it got late, a tight monsoon suddenly broke out with violent force. The wind blew past the eaves, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>The Weather Suddenly Turned Cold: Although the heavy rain and strong wind had slightly subsided by midnight, they had not stopped. The wind was still extremely tight yesterday, and the temperature dropped sharply. Compared with the day before yesterday, the season seemed to have changed. Moreover, clouds were floating all day long, and the weather was extremely unstable. Furthermore, due to the northeast wind, the tide level of the Huangpu River was very high.</p>
<h3>Aboard the Desheng Steamer, a Passenger Dies While a Monkey Mourns</h3>
<p>His worldly possessions were few, a monkey his companion;</p>
<p>His heart failed, and his life was lost.</p>
<p>On the Jardine Matheson's Desheng steamer, scheduled to depart from Pier Nos. 2 and 3 yesterday for Qingdao, a passenger was suddenly found dead in steerage before the ship was due to leave. A monkey was beside him, mourning. The ship's crew, hearing the sound of the monkey's cries, went to investigate. The deceased was about forty years old, dressed in a blue cloth short coat, with no other possessions except the monkey as his companion. They reported the matter to the customs, who sent a doctor to determine that the deceased had died of heart failure. As per regulations, a court inquest and funeral arrangements were required, so the water police station was notified, and Detective Xu Yaonian was instructed to transport the body to the South Bund Lifesaving Bureau. The monkey was taken to the local court, and a request was made for an examination and disposition. Prosecutor Wang left the monkey in the hospital outside the court and, along with the inspectors, conducted an examination and instructed the hall to handle the funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3>Yellow Head Competition</h3>
<p>Mu Ouchu, President of the Shanghai Shicun Society, Vice Presidents Jiang Futian and Wang Dayong, etc., issued a brief announcement to initiate a yellow head competition: "Lamenting that viperous snakes rage and are about to be completely sealed off to the east, and that the Hu horses are forming groups and still spying on the northern borders, we are already forced into a state of being swallowed whole and cannot bear to become rotten fish. If we can be vigilant with ten thousandth of the means, why fear violating the law? Observing and learning to transform customs, we are willing to ask the group. Therefore, we aspire to be Wu Guan in the swamp, emulating the frogs' anger by the roadside, and we keep in mind the chickens' sounds in the middle of the night during the Jin Dynasty dance. Emotive feelings often arise from objects. In Guangdong, there are small yellow-headed birds with tight feathers, protruding heels, and lively glances. They call their companions and firmly fortify their fences together. Although they are only the size of a fist, they possess the courage of ten thousand men. If foreign tribes invade, they will not hesitate to resist with their entire group. When they march high and soar, the masses are not the bird's platform; they ride the wind to compete and surpass with the vigor of a Peng bird spreading its wings. They rely on claws and beaks as spears and shields, and wear feathers as armor. Even if they are disemboweled, they will not return defeated. How often have they had their feathers broken and their heads lowered, dragging their weapons and fleeing? We, the people, lament the quail's return to the case, and with shared hatred, we look forward to the return of the frogs' shade to Lu, so that martial virtue can be promoted. Taking advantage of the rich spring, we are happy to see that the strong servants are healthy. We will hold a competition to see whose magnificent wings soar into the sky, touching the sun with ambition. Hopefully, some cowards will stand up. Alas, it is difficult to fill the sea of hatred. The great wind has risen. We dot the dragon's eyes on the book wall, and we will eventually see it ascend to heaven. We buy a horse's bones at the Golden Platform and eventually recover lost ground. The meeting has a special loss of ambition; why ever express sympathy? We only hope to attend the appointment. The date is the 25th day of the fourth month of the 26th year (that is, the 15th day of the third month in the old calendar), Sunday. The location is Bansong Garden in the southern part of Shanghai. The prizes are flower decorations. Comrades from all regions who wish to come to Shanghai to participate in the competition must immediately request a registration form from Suo Jinglai, lest they miss out. The address is Mu Ouchu, 260 Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Throwing Manure at the Buddha's Head</h3>
<p>The Jade Buddha Temple's Monk Suffers Insult, Two Manure-Throwers Caught on the Spot</p>
<p>The abbot Zeng Chenzhen of the Jade Buddha Temple at No. 280, Fourth Pinlang Road, one of the city's four major monastic forests, was riding in a taxi numbered 10469, driven by Dong Zhaorong, at 10:20 AM the day before yesterday, intending to go to Haining Road. When passing Gordon Road near Haifang Road, a man suddenly stepped forward and blocked the way. At the same time, two men came forward, one holding a hatbox filled with yellow and white substances, and violently threw it at Monk Chenzhen, causing the monk's entire body to be stained with fecal matter. The three men, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled. Monk Chenzhen and his driver Dong Zhaorong called out and, with the help of Chinese Constable No. 1028 and Japanese Constable No. 12, chased after them and arrested Yao Jinhe and Ji Yujun from Jiangbei. One person escaped. Yao and Ji were taken to the Gordon Road Police Station. After investigation by Chinese Detective Zhu Mengwei and Detective Xu Guirong, they were taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, stated the previous circumstances and filed charges under Article 309 of the Criminal Law. Monk Chenzhen and Dong Zhaorong testified that Yao Jinhe threw the manure and Ji was also present at the scene. When questioned, Yao confessed that a monk named Fachen had ordered my brother Yao Jintang to do this. The day before, the monk led my brothers and me to the gate of the Jade Buddha Temple to identify Chenzhen's appearance before we took action yesterday. When questioned, Ji Yujun completely denied it. Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the confessions and ordered that the case be adjourned for one week for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Tongjiazu Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 7:45, three bandits suddenly broke into No. 75, Lane 417, Zhoujiazu Road, Hongkou. One of the bandits drew a pistol and threatened the victim. More than 200 yuan in national currency were robbed and the bandits fled, disappearing without a trace. Afterwards, the victim reported the incident to the relevant police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Wang Fengnian Sues His Mother and Brother Again</h3>
<p>Requesting Division into Three Parts, All for Money; His Brother Appears in Court to Respond, Denying Everything</p>
<p>Wang Yinting, the owner of Wanshunfeng Paint Store in Ningbo, married Yang as his wife and had six sons: Wang Fengnian, Wang Shijun, Wang Shangfen, Wang Zhengxuan, Wang Zhengfang, and Wang Zhengxi. Wang Yinting passed away in the 13th year of the Republic (1924), and all his property, estimated to be worth tens of thousands, was managed by Yang. Later, Wang Fengnian, due to the fact that his father's inheritance had not been divided, which lead to financial difficulties, sued Yang in the First Special District Court, requesting payment for living expenses. The court ruled that Wang Fengnian should receive 6,000 yuan per year in living expenses before the inheritance was divided, which was already decided.</p>
<p>Enforcement of Judgment</p>
<p>Now, Wang Fengnian has sued his mother, Wang Yangshi, his brothers Wang Shijun, Wang Zhengfen, Wang Zhengxuan, Wang Zhengfang, and Wang Zhengxi, as well as the China Reclamation Bank and Yongfeng Qianzhuang, in the First Special District Court. His requests are divided into three parts: (1) Because the first to sixth defendants have not paid his annual living expenses of 6,000 yuan for three years, he requests that they be ordered to pay a total of 18,000 yuan for the living expenses of the 23rd, 24th, and 25th years of the Republic. (2) According to the draft distribution document drawn up by Yinting in the 13th year of the Republic, the plaintiff and his son, Chuidiao, should receive a fee for the eldest son and eldest grandson, totaling 10,000 yuan. Except for the 5,000 yuan that the plaintiff has already received, Chuidiao has died and his coffin is placed at the Siming Guild Hall, so the 5,000 yuan he should have received has not yet been received. Because it is urgently needed for burial, he also asks the court to order the payment of this amount. (3) The plaintiff and the defendant have 30,000 yuan in shares in the China Reclamation Bank (under the name Wang Fucheng), and the plaintiff also has 10,000 yuan in shares under his own name. He requests confirmation of his priority rights and that the shares be used exclusively for the plaintiff's personal</p>
<p>Debt Repayment</p>
<p>He also requests a preliminary execution for the living expenses. The case was heard by Judge Luo Shuo in the Fourth Civil Court yesterday afternoon. Only the defendant Wang Shijun appeared in court to argue that the plaintiff's request for living expenses should only be enjoyed before the inheritance is divided, but the court has already ruled on the division of the father's inheritance, and the execution has been completed, and there is a certificate of property division. Since the property has already been divided, there is no reason to request living expenses again. As for the eldest grandson's fee, he does not know anything about it and the draft distribution document has never been seen, so it cannot be paid. As for the 40,000 yuan in shares in the Reclamation Bank, they all belong to the common property. Later, because the plaintiff, Wang Fengnian, served as the chief auditor of the bank, 10,000 yuan was allocated as a guarantee, so it also belongs to the common property. Therefore, the plaintiff's request should be rejected. Yongfeng Qianzhuang also sent a lawyer to court to respond. Judge Luo reviewed the confessions and ordered that the case be adjourned for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Lin Gendi, a Key Figure in the Box Corpse Case, Arrested Again</h3>
<p>Using a Toy Gun to Rob a Schoolgirl of Her Wool Coat; Detained and Sent to Court for Interrogation</p>
<p>Lin Gendi, an 18-year-old Ningbo woman residing at No. 33, Lane 412, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, was previously arrested by the Hongkou Police Station on suspicion of involvement in the sensational box corpse case and prosecuted for murder in the First Special District Court. In the first instance, Lin was acquitted. The police station, dissatisfied, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, but the police station's appeal was rejected, and they gave up the third instance appeal. Lin Gendi was released on February 10th of this year. However, Lin did not repent and was arrested again yesterday. On the morning of the 1st of this month at 9:45 AM, Lin Gendi entered Taihe Primary School at No. 47, Lane 58, Huade Road, alone. Under the pretext of needing to use the lavatory, she saw an eleven-year-old schoolgirl, Wu Baolin, inside. She had a bad thought, thinking that Wu was young and easily deceived. She falsely claimed to Wu that her mother had instructed her to come and take a wool coat. Wu, not recognizing Lin, refused to hand it over. Lin forcibly took off Wu's wool coat, worth five yuan, and fled. Wu went home and learned that her mother had not sent anyone, realizing she had been deceived, and reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, requesting an investigation. The day before yesterday, Lin Gendi went to the school again to use the lavatory and was seen by Wu and her teacher, who reported it to the police station. Detective Wang Yongjun was dispatched to arrest Lin Gendi and take her to the police station. A search for the original stolen item was unsuccessful, and she was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Tenth Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted her for theft under Article 320 of the Criminal Law and presented the case. Wu Baolin testified that she was eleven years old, from Huzhou, and studying at Taihe Primary School. On the morning of the 1st of March, after class was dismissed at 9:45 AM, I went to the lavatory and saw the defendant inside. She said that my mother had instructed her to come and take the coat. I refused, and the defendant forcibly took it and fled. When questioned, Lin Gendi denied the charges, saying that she had not been to Taihe Primary School on March 1st. Yesterday, while walking on Huade Road, she felt an urgent need to use the lavatory and went to the nearby Taihe Primary School's lavatory, where she was arrested. She did not steal the wool coat. The confession she made yesterday at the police station was forced. Judge Ye Shengchao reviewed the confessions and ordered Lin Gendi to be detained and investigated for seven days before further questioning.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Reduces Saltpeter Tax Rate</h3>
<p>Two Cents Per Dan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has instructed the Changlu Transport Commissioner to approve the case of the Heji Chemical Alum Industry Company's reduction of the saltpeter tax rate and has specifically ordered the Salt Affairs Audit General Office to instruct the Changlu Audit Branch Office to comply with the original order. The case concerns the Heji Chemical Industry Company's purchase of saltpeter from the Changlu Lutai field, which has historically been taxed at two cents per dan. The Changlu Transport Commissioner forwarded a request from the company, stating that the production cost of the product is high, and that the market is currently flooded with foreign goods from North China. Reducing costs is necessary to compete in sales. The company requested that the saltpeter tax rate be reduced to two cents per dan, following the precedent of the Bohai Company. After review, the Ministry determined that the reasons stated were not unreasonable and instructed the Changlu Transport Commissioner to approve the request. This order is issued to the General Office for notification and to instruct the Changlu Audit Branch Office to comply. This order is issued by Minister Kong Xiangxi.</p>

<h3>The Tang Youren Assassination Case Continues with Both Defendants Recanting</h3>
<p>Previously Claiming Confessions Were Obtained Through Torture; The Case Still Awaits Investigation and Further Interrogation</p>
<p>In the case of the assassination of Tang Youren, the former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, who was shot and killed by thugs in front of his private residence in Gan Village, Gansidong Road, French Concession, at 5:00 PM on December 25th of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the perpetrators, Liu Zhennan from Hubei and Mai Jiyu from Shaoxing, were arrested successively by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and the Public Concession Police and brought back by the French Police to be handed over to the Second Special District Court. The lawyer from the French Police Department filed a public prosecution on charges of murder.</p>
<p>During the court hearing by the former Chief Judge of the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, Mr. Wang Gangxu, both defendants confessed to the murder of Tang without denying it. However, after the new Chief Judge Liao Lu took over and repeatedly held hearings, because the defendants had been transferred to the detention center, they unanimously overturned their previous confessions and denied the assassination. The situation of being ordered to be detained pending further investigation and interrogation has been reported in the previous newspapers many times. At 10:00 AM yesterday morning, the Chief Judge of the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, Liao Lu, came to the First Criminal Court to continue the hearing and ordered the two defendants to be brought to the case, announcing</p>
<p>A Renewed Trial</p>
<p>After questioning the defendants about their ages and origins, the lawyer from the Police Department, Gu Shouxi, presented the case and the relevant articles of law. Then, he questioned Liu Zhennan about how he knew Yang Yousheng. Liu replied, "I was previously sentenced to five years in prison by the Mixed Court for a crime. In the 24th year of the Republic, the court added two months to my sentence. I met Yang Yousheng in prison. Yang was imprisoned for forgery. I was released on April 16th. After Yang was released on May 1st, he sent a letter inviting me to Junyi Lane, Beile Road, to</p>
<p>Meet with Xiao Jia</p>
<p>On January 2nd of the previous year, I went to Hong Kong at Yang's invitation. We never discussed assassinating Tang Youren." He was asked, "How did you originally confess in the Public Security Bureau, the French Police Station, and in this court about how you planned and shot Tang to death? You spoke very clearly. Why are you now being evasive?" He replied, "I was severely tortured in the Public Security Bureau and the French Police Station. I confessed in court because I was afraid of being returned to the police station and suffering more. Therefore, I confessed according to the confession prepared by the Public Security Bureau and the police station</p>
<p>Only Seeking a Quick Death</p>
<p>In fact, I am truly innocent. I beg the Chief Judge to be aware of this." Qiu Jiyu also vehemently protested his innocence and recanted his confession. Finally, the French Police Detective of Gan Village testified that on the day of the incident, he only heard gunshots. The assailant was wearing a coat and cotton robe, and only saw his back. He fled south towards the wasteland. At this point, the court determined that the case still required detailed investigation and announced that it would be adjourned until April 14th for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to detention.</p>

<h3>French Police Detective Kidnapped by Bandits</h3>
<p>Robbed of His Gun, Then Returned; Bandits' True Target Possibly Someone Else</p>
<p>At around midnight yesterday morning, an incident occurred on Avenue Foch in the French Concession in which a French police detective was forced into a car by bandits. The bandits stole the gun he carried and the coat he was wearing. Eventually, the bandits returned the detective to his original location in the same car. After investigation, it was learned that the car used by the bandits was stolen from Yu Qiaqing Road in the Public Concession. It is speculated by the police that the kidnapping of the French police detective was a case of mistaken identity. The true target of the bandits was likely someone else. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Newly Appointed Detective</p>
<p>Gao Amao from Jiangbei, a newly appointed detective with the French Police, number 179, has been on duty for just over three months. On the night before last, Gao was dispatched to patrol the area within the borders of Western Shanghai. At around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, while Gao was patrolling at the corner of Avenue Foch and Pinfang Teahouse, four bandits suddenly jumped out from the side of the road and forced Gao into a black car parked nearby. The car's concession number was 5144, and the city registration number was 34.</p>
<p>Kidnapped and Returned</p>
<p>After the four bandits forced Gao into the car, they drove away at high speed, heading directly to the area of Rue Massenet. The bandits searched him and robbed him of his gun, coat, detective's license, etc. After more than an hour, the bandits returned Gao to Avenue Foch in the same car and pushed him out.</p>
<p>Suspected Mistaken Identity</p>
<p>After getting out of the car, Gao regained his composure and reported the incident to the police chief. The incident was bizarre, and the kidnapping of a police detective was unprecedented. After investigation by the entire police force, it was concluded that the bandits had other plans, and Gao's kidnapping was a case of mistaken identity. The true target was likely someone else.</p>
<p>Origin of the Car</p>
<p>The French police immediately notified the police stations in the Public Concession and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau of the car's number, instructing them to be on the lookout for it. Eventually, the Laozha Police Station learned that the car was stolen from Li Ningxiang, an engineer residing at No. 197 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, between 8:00 PM and 11:00 PM the night before last.</p>
<p>Details of the Car Theft</p>
<p>Li parked his car between Yu Qiaqing Road and Beihai Road. When he returned, the car was gone. He reported the theft to the Laozha Police Station. It was then learned that the car used by the bandits was stolen from Li. The police are conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Huang Hongjun and His Wife Return to Shanghai After Two Years Abroad</h3>
<p>Successful Publicity Results</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Hongjun and his wife, the General Manager of the China Underwear Company, returned to Shanghai last month after spending the past two years in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, dedicated to promoting Chinese industry, plugging loopholes in the economy, and achieving economic salvation. They also expanded the company's efforts to encourage overseas Chinese to return to China, develop industries, and encourage overseas Chinese children to return to their homeland for education in order to prepare for future employment and advancement, avoiding the suffering of being treated harshly by foreign races. According to Mr. Huang, the publicity work had four goals: (1) The value of goods imported into China each year exceeds one trillion yuan. More than six or seven million overseas Chinese live abroad. The silver coins remitted back to China each year are only about 140 to 150 million yuan. If overseas Chinese jointly invest these funds to develop treasures and establish more factories, the leakage of revenue can be recovered, and foreign goods can be eliminated. Overseas Chinese can live and work in peace in China, which is better than being exploited by others. (2) Although overseas Chinese children study abroad and even graduate from universities, they often do not understand the national conditions or speak the national language. It is already extremely difficult to find employment, let alone develop. (3) Foreign governments heavily tax the purchase of buildings and properties abroad. Even without tenants, the owner must pay taxes. Therefore, the real estate industry is generally depressed, and most people are unable to pay taxes and the properties are taken back by the foreign government and sold publicly. As a result, some overseas Chinese who were once millionaires have suddenly become commoners. In China, there is no such tragedy of taxing and publicly selling houses. This is clear evidence that overseas Chinese should return to China to do business. (4) Overseas Chinese do not know how to remit silver back to Shanghai for savings to benefit industry. Foreign banks offer weekly interest rates of only 1.5% to 3%, while Shanghai banks offer interest rates of 8% or 9%. Why not use hard-earned money to generate profits? When Mr. Huang first arrived in a major port, he distributed a plan for living and working in peace. As soon as it was published in the newspaper, more than 100 people requested copies every day. Most overseas Chinese, after reading it, praised its perfection and completeness, calling it a compass for overseas Chinese. Therefore, Mr. Huang and his wife were well received by overseas Chinese in major cities. They were frequently invited to banquets. When Mr. Huang was in a major port, he organized an "Association to Assist Overseas Chinese in Returning to China to Develop Industries." Branches were also established in various ports as a foundation for industrial salvation and to expand the underwear company. Overseas Chinese in various foreign countries subscribed to about one million yuan in shares. However, due to the increasingly urgent foreign aggression in the motherland and the tense situation, overseas Chinese were uneasy. Therefore, the funds will be remitted to Shanghai successively after the situation has calmed down.</p>
<h3>Relief Efforts After Fire in Wu Family Hall, Pudong</h3>
<p>Shen Xingyuan and Guan Lin Donate Rice</p>
<p>The thatched sheds in the Wu Family Hall area, east of the Yangjiazhai area in Pudong, suddenly suffered a fire at noon on the 13th of this month, destroying seventy or eighty thatched sheds and causing heavy losses. Details were previously published in the newspaper. It is now known that Mr. Xu Baoming, the head of the Yangjing District Defense Corps in the area, seeing that the many victims were homeless and in a very miserable situation, could not bear to sit idly by. He sent a letter to Mr. Wang Yiting and Mr. Xu Qianlin, the two presidents of the Shanghai Jisheng Association, requesting relief. The association then sent personnel to the fire site to conduct an on-site investigation. A total of 65 households were registered, with 427 victims of all ages. After the registration was completed, a large batch of miscellaneous grains and clothing was prepared and distributed to the site at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The Pudong Police Sub-bureau and the Yangjing District Defense Corps strictly maintained order, which was quite good. The work was completed at 4:00 PM. It is also reported that Mr. Xia Xinqi, the director of the Pudong District Chamber of Commerce, also joined with local gentry Shen Xingyuan and Li Guanlin to donate dozens of dan of white rice for distribution to the victims as a form of relief.</p>
<h3>Further Details on the Murder Case of Tao Wenhai, Hacked to Death with an Axe on Jinling Road</h3>
<p>Motive Revealed as Adultery; Adulterer and Adulteress Both Apprehended</p>
<p>On the morning of the 7th of this month, at the intersection of Jinling Road and Huakang Road in Zhabei, a pedestrian named Tao Wenhai (also known as Tao Wenkai) was hacked in the head with an axe by a thug, collapsing and dying in a pool of blood on the road. The Yangmiao Police Station of the Xinzha Sub-bureau, which had jurisdiction over the area, recovered the murder weapon, an axe, and reported the case to the Shanghai Local Court for investigation.</p>
<p>Following the Incident</p>
<p>Liu Huai, the captain of the Detective Squad, and Qian Tianxiong, the leader of the Sixth Squad, paid close attention to the case. By the 14th of this month, the squad had determined that the crime was motivated by adultery. They immediately arrested Tao Zhu, the deceased's wife, age 32, residing at No. 22 Yongqing Lane, Huakang Road; Liu Zhiheng, age 38, residing at No. 3 Tong'an Lane, Chang'an Road; Lu Er, age 46 (nicknamed "Little Yangzhou"), residing in a shed behind the Jianghuai Guild Hall at No. 70 Huta Road; and Wang Shaoyu, age 36, residing in a shed at No. 6 Liuying Road. Tao Zhu confessed to having</p>
<p>an Affair for Six Years</p>
<p>and living with her lover, Cui Zigao, in the same room. "My daughter has always called Cui her 'godfather.' On the 16th day of the first lunar month of this year, Cui wanted to kill my husband, but I refused. I don't know where Cui Zigao has gone now. You can ask Liu Hengsan for information," she stated. Liu Hengsan claimed, "Cui Zigao is my nephew. He sent me a letter on the 10th of this month, saying he was staying at No. 10 Hujiayuan in Nanjing City." Based on this information, Captain Qian immediately dispatched Liu Bingyuan, a squad leader, and detective Liu Heng at 4:00 PM that afternoon,</p>
<p>Accompanied by an Informant</p>
<p>to take a train to Nanjing. They coordinated with Cheng Hongsheng, the duty officer of the Fourth Detective Group of the Capital Police Department. They went to Hujiayuan in the city and found that the original shacks had been demolished. After inquiring around, they learned that the residents had moved to Sajiawan, near Jiancang Bridge. The informant identified Cui Zigao, and he and his companion, Shen Yingkao, were apprehended. They were brought to Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday morning). Cui Zigao, age 38, confessed that he had been living with Tao Zhu and having an affair for six years. He had wanted to kill Tao Wenhai</p>
<p>Several Times</p>
<p>The first time was in December of last year. Zhu said that her husband often beat and scolded her, and she couldn't bear it. She urged me to find a way to kill Tao Wenhai. I refused, and she threatened to kill herself and say that I had driven her to it. Later, I entrusted someone to do the job, but they wanted 150 yuan in hush money. I negotiated it down to 100 yuan and told Zhu. She said that if it could be done, 100 yuan was fine. On the afternoon of December 28th, Zhu took out</p>
<p>Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>and gave it to me, half in advance. I delivered the money to the tea house at the northern end of the Wuzhen Road Bridge. Later, on the morning of March 7th, I saw that Tao had been hacked to death with an axe and realized that it must have been the person I entrusted. But I don't know his name or where he lives. After Tao died, I was afraid to go home. I asked my uncle, Liu Hengsan, to give me twenty yuan, and I asked Shen Yingkao to accompany me to Nanjing because I didn't know my way around. Lu Er (i.e., Little Yangzhou) claimed that the deceased, Tao Wenhai, and the others were all from</p>
<p>Huaiyin and Worked at the Fuxin No. 7 Flour Mill</p>
<p>That night, I invited Tao to my house for dinner and walked him part of the way home. That's all true, but I don't know who killed him. Shen Yingkao, age 33, residing at No. 14 Yaojia Stone Bridge, stated that he and the deceased worked at the same factory. His testimony was similar to Cui Zigao's. Wang Shaoyu claimed that he and Tao Wenhai also worked at the Fuxin No. 7 Flour Mill and were from the same hometown. That night, I ran into the deceased on the street. I don't know how he was hacked to death. After verifying the confessions, the squad transferred the adulterer, adulteress, and the other six individuals to the Xinzha Sub-bureau, which then handed them over to the Third Section of the Police Headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>National Sugar Production and Sales Association</h3>
<p>A Respectful Message to the Japanese Sugar Industry and the Economic Delegation Visiting China!</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the National Sugar Production and Sales Association of China was formed last autumn by a combination of nationalized sugar factories and sugar sales merchants. The chairman of the board is Liu Weichi, and the directors are Yuan Liang, Lu Zuofu, Huang Jiangquan, etc. The Association, recognizing that the smuggling in North China in recent years has had a significant impact on the sugar industry, has taken the opportunity of the Chinese-Japanese Trade Association holding its members' conference in Shanghai to issue a "Respectful Message to the Japanese Sugar Industry and the Economic Delegation Visiting China" through the board of directors. The wording is still thorough and sincere. At a time when the national economies of China and Japan are advocating cooperation, this article is truly a representation of the genuine public opinion of a segment of our country. It is reported that the Association has printed the full text and sent it specifically to visiting envoys and members of various delegations, as well as distributing it to relevant organizations. We have extracted the original text below:</p>
<p>A Respectful Message to the Japanese Sugar Industry and the Economic Delegation Visiting China!</p>
<p>Sugar is a daily necessity for human life, and the amount consumed is always directly proportional to the progress of the nation. According to world sugar industry statistics, the United States consumes 48 kilograms of sugar per person per year, the United Kingdom consumes 49 kilograms, France and Germany each consume 26 kilograms, Japan consumes 13 kilograms, and the difference between the amount of sugar consumed by urban people and rural commoners in China is too great. Although the average statistics per person per year are not detailed, even if we calculate it at the minimum amount of 5 kilograms, then 400 million people should consume 20 million metric tons of sugar per year (each metric ton is equal to 100 kilograms). According to recent statistics from last year, China's annual sugar production is only 6.7 million metric tons. Therefore, the amount of foreign sugar that China will need to import each year in the future will be at least 13 million metric tons, worth 286 million yuan in national currency. This huge trade is the object of competition for sugar-producing countries around the world—including Japan. Japan is close to China, the distance is short, and transportation costs are low. Its refined sugar and fine cotton sand are also favored by ordinary Chinese people. Therefore, in theory, the sales of Japanese sugar in China should be in a more advantageous position than those of other countries. This is something that we would like to ask you to pay attention to first.</p>
<p>However, according to Chinese customs statistics last year, the amount of imported sugar was only 1.585 million metric tons (less than one-fifth of the amount in 1929), of which only more than 560,000 metric tons were imported from Japan, accounting for only one-third of the total. As we know, the amount of smuggled sugar transported from Dalian to North China last year actually reached 1,008,501 bags, equivalent to approximately 890,000 metric tons. However, because it was smuggled in and not transported openly, the customs statistics could not include it. However, China's loss of customs duties on this item has reached more than 8.7 million gold units, equivalent to approximately 20 million yuan in national currency. The amount of smuggled sugar transported from Taiwan to South China is not included. Smuggling sugar is a despicable and improper means of destroying the law and defying good faith, directly squeezing the profits of our legitimate sugar production and sales merchants, and should be jointly eliminated by sugar merchants in both countries. All Chinese sugar merchants have jointly appealed to our government to strictly stipulate anti-smuggling laws and earnestly adopt strict measures to stop the spread of smuggled sugar. However, Japanese ruffians have repeatedly incited influential people to fuel its flames, and even interfered with anti-smuggling efforts, committing murder and robbery. The evidence is clear. Your organization has always been known for its preparedness, but you have remained silent, watching the legitimate reputation of the organization tarnished internationally, and the benefits you should have received have been eroded. This is something that Chinese sugar merchants deeply regret and would like to sincerely ask you to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Although the tax rate on Chinese sugar customs duties is slightly higher than that on other imported goods, it is by no means an excuse for those who smuggle sugar. As Chinese merchants know, according to your country's 1935 Sugar Industry Yearbook, the amount of sugar produced in your country in 1935 (including Korea, Hokkaido, Taiwan, and the South Seas Mandated Territory) was more than 18.351 million tons, while the amount of sugar consumed by your country (including all its territories) in 1935 was more than 17.772 million tons. Adding the more than 1.27 million tons sold to the Northeast Provinces of our country, the two figures confirm each other. This shows that your country not only does not have excess sugar production to sell to China, but is also demanding more than it can supply. Then, what relationship does the height of China's sugar tax have with you? Even if you can transship and sell sugar from the Java area, the current sugar tariff rate in our country is higher than that of 80-90% of other countries. Italy, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Germany are all clear examples (Italy and Poland's sugar tax is 6-7 times higher than China's, and Czechoslovakia, Hungary, the Netherlands, and Germany are all more than 3 times higher). Even in your own country, the standard tax is 7.4 yen per metric ton, plus a surcharge of 2.59 yen and a consumption tax of 9.5 yen, for a total of 19.49 yen, which is not lighter than our country's. Why single us out for blame? Moreover, the establishment of import tax rates is related to the prosperity of a country's trade and the integrity of a country's sovereignty. You have come here to call for respect for sovereignty, and we have heard that you want to establish the benefits of private economies on a basis of equality and mutual benefit. Surely you will not disregard reason and logic and recklessly advocate for reducing sugar taxes.</p>
<p>Since the industrial revolution in the 19th century, every country has used tariff barriers to protect its domestic industries. Even in your country, you have done well. Unfortunately, China has been bound by unequal treaties for 80 years, resulting in industrial backwardness. Since tariff autonomy, domestic industries have begun to make progress. You clearly know that the smuggling of ruffians should be stopped. If you instead use smuggling as leverage to demand tax cuts from our government, then you must know that this matter concerns the life and death of all of our merchants. We will resolutely explain to our people and appeal to our government the reasons why the level of sugar tax has nothing to do with your country's sugar production and that tax cuts would cut off the newborn industries of China. We must not allow you to be deceived by the ruffians and let a neighboring country of the same race and culture, as close as brothers, be trapped in a state of industrial stagnation for a long time.</p>
<p>The profit from sugar is very thin, as you well know. Since smuggling began, we, the sugar merchants, have toiled hard all year round but still cannot afford to eat our fill. Who is to blame for this hardship? As for those unscrupulous Chinese merchants, although they have colluded with Japanese ruffians for private gain, one denunciation can cost them their lives. In recent months, more than 200 people in the northern areas have lost their families and lives as a result. These 200-plus people were all legitimate sugar merchants, but because smuggling has become rampant, legitimate business cannot compete, so they have been forced to make this desperate gamble with their lives. Although their crime cannot be excused, their families and grandchildren, tracing back to the root of the disaster, all cry and hate, vying to become enemies of the Japanese ruffians. You have also been innocently subjected to cold looks. As a result, your other goods in China have also sown bad seeds. If this kind of psychology spreads, your industry in China will have no foothold. Therefore, just from the perspective of impropriety in the sugar trade, smuggling is harmful to the trade and the national sentiments of both countries. Furthermore, smuggling today is not limited to sugar alone. You may also think deeply about it.</p>
<p>China is the world's largest patron, and sugar is no exception. If you suddenly come to your senses, for the sake of your own interests and the interests of your entire Japanese business community in China, report to your government and effectively stop the ruffians who smuggle sugar, and further request that your consulates in China earnestly assist our customs in anti-smuggling efforts, then we—the national sugar producers and sellers—will be moved by your good intentions and will unite to the best of our ability to eliminate the disgrace you have suffered in the past, and will also seek the greatest possible legitimate outlet for your sugar exports to China.</p>
<p>At the time of this declaration, we are prepared to discuss with you a practical and beneficial plan for your legitimate trade, based on this great hope. You are all advanced leaders in the industry, and you have come from afar, so you will surely benefit our country. Moreover, you have all created businesses, assisted in restoration, experienced the difficulties of self-reliance, and tasted the hardships of economic construction. Therefore, all of us who are enduring and striving today, and moving towards self-reliance, will especially be understood and sympathized with by you. This is why we do not hesitate to tell you in detail, urging you to make a fair judgment and not to make this trip in vain. We sincerely hope that you will respond in the same voice to this sincerity of uplifting the Eastern people, cherishing, and prospering trade. Sincerely,</p>
<p>National Sugar Production and Sales Association of China</p>

<h3>The Yang Zhao Family Takes Three Young Girls to Tianjin for Fun</h3>
<p>Separate Interrogation; Conflicting Statements</p>
<p>At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Lin Yongfang, an investigator from the China Relief Society for Women and Children, along with Yao Guofa, a detective from the Customs Water Police Station, inspected the Beiyang Bansheng steamer of the Yihua Company, which was about to set sail for Tianjin from Hongkou. In the steerage, they encountered a middle-aged woman leading three young girls, whose actions seemed suspicious. They immediately interrogated them. The woman claimed to be Yang Zhao, 37 years old, from Wangting, Suzhou. The three girls were her biological daughters, and they were going to Tianjin for fun. The detectives interrogated the three girls separately. One girl, named Wang Ada, 17 years old, and another girl, named Yang Zhangmei, also 17 years old, both from Wangting, said that Yang Zhao was a relative and not their biological mother. The other girl, named Yang Qiaoxian, 18 years old, admitted that the woman was her mother. All three girls said that Yang had asked them to go to Tianjin for fun and that they did not know the details. The detectives found that their statements were inconsistent and suspected that she was abducting and selling them overseas. They took all four people to the police station for further investigation.</p>

The theater troupe did not dare to be complacent and re-arranged the play "Empress Dowager Wen." The plot of this play is humorous and amorous, with suspenseful scenes. The selection and matching of male and female lead roles is appropriate, and a large number of new, magnificent costumes have been made. Experts have also been hired to skillfully set up various mechanical scenery, so as to make the play even more perfect. The high level of music and the freshness of the lyrics and tunes are especially noteworthy. It is reported that the play is scheduled to premiere at the theater on the evening of the 20th of this month. It is expected that there will be a grand scene with carriages and crowds.</p>

<h3>Modern Politics and China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Furthermore, when we observe comparatively, we can see that: both group governance and leadership governance under monarchical politics have their own differences; both group governance and leadership governance under democratic politics also have distinctions. For example, both Britain and Japan are group governance under monarchical politics, but Britain is centered on political parties, which is party politics, multi-party politics; while Japan is centered on the military, and has a trend towards one-party politics. As for leadership governance under monarchical politics, because there is only one country, Italy, there is no comparison, so it will not be discussed here. Looking at democratic politics, the group governance of France and the group governance of the United States are also different. The US is democratic and centralized, while France is democratic and decentralized. There are also great differences between Russia and Germany in leadership governance under democratic politics (Russia is a Soviet federal republic and admits to being a democratic country). For example, Germany is a leadership dictatorship under democratic politics, while Russia is a personal autocracy; Russia is one class oppressing other classes, while Germany is uniting all classes against the outside world. The spirit and essence are completely different. Therefore, today's politics has two major divisions: one is group governance or leadership governance under constitutional monarchy; the other is group governance or leadership governance under democratic republic; and the essence of these two forms is also different. This point is what we must pay attention to when studying the true picture of politics today. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Thread</h3>
<p>Yarn sales remain brisk.</p>
<p>Tagged Yarn prices attempt to advance but instead retreat.</p>
<p>Five Blessings Shepherd brand yarn is offered at a low price.</p>
<p>Hopes of hoarding goods are fading.</p>
<p>After the sharp rise in the yarn market the day before yesterday, yesterday it calmed down again. Current yarn trading remains active. Buyers from various provinces arrive in succession, especially those from Sichuan, the interior, Tianjin, and Guangdong, who are particularly eager to buy. However, prices have not risen, so people are hesitant. There are rumors in the market that if prices exceed forty yuan this month, certain gentlemen will have no intention of hoarding goods. At the same time, it is widely rumored that the Ewo Mill has offered four to five thousand bales of 20-count Five Blessings Shepherd yarn at increasingly lower prices, further depressing market sentiment.</p>
<p>The price of current month yarn drops by one yuan seventy.</p>
<p>The opening price of tagged yarn this morning varied across different months. However, American cotton remained strong, while Osaka's Three Grades Yarn fell back by one yuan. During the second session, the price for this month fell below the forty yuan mark. According to rumors in the market, the bulls of certain gentlemen have released large quantities of stock, and there are even rumors of them turning bearish. Forward prices followed suit, declining. By the third closing bell, it was reported that the current yarn business remained active, with buyers from all sides still purchasing around two thousand bales. As a result, short sellers covered their positions, and the market rebounded upwards. At the close of trading, the price of tagged yarn for this month fell by five jiao, while other months remained unchanged. At the opening of the afternoon session, market sentiment was sluggish, as the price of Three Grades Yarn had slightly retreated. Market rumors suggested that an English mill had offered five thousand bales of Five Blessings Shepherd yarn at particularly low prices, and there were also reports of hedging sales. Selling pressure suddenly increased, and the price for this month broke the forty yuan mark again during the second session, with forward months following suit. However, current yarn transactions still amounted to around four thousand bales. Compared to the closing prices in the afternoon session, the prices of tagged yarn for each month fell by six, seven, or eight jiao to one yuan. Sales included: Tung Foo, 1,450 bales sold, leaving 950 bales remaining; Heng Yih, 1,050 bales; Ta Fung, 1,650 bales; Yih Kee, 1,200 bales; Tai Hing, 1,250 bales; Yuan Yih, 2,050 bales; Ta Chang Cheng, 3,000 bales; Chang Fung, 3,050 bales; Ta Chang, 2,100 bales; Sheng Yuan, 1,050 bales; Hsieh Cheng, 1,000 bales.

<p>The sales of current yarn remain good. Statistics show that various merchants purchased a total of 3,963 bales throughout the day, and the selling price is firm and stable. The purchase amounts of various merchants are listed below.</p>
<p>Many Profiteering Bulls Close Positions</p>
<p>The rising trend in cotton falters slightly.</p>
<p>The cotton market saw a shift towards calmness, with the rising trend from the previous day inevitably prompting some bulls to close out their positions. However, American cotton continues to advance, with the spot price reaching one jiao and five fen. The rising trend in Indian cotton is even more intense, with forward months reaching new highs, breaking through the six yuan mark. In the afternoon, profit-takers closed out their positions, and forward prices saw a slight retreat.</p>
<p>June once exceeded the six yuan mark.</p>
<p>The opening price of tagged cotton this morning showed declines across various months, as the rising trend from the previous day was deemed too drastic, prompting bulls to close their positions. However, American cotton continued to rise, with the spot price reaching one jiao and five fen. The rising trend in Indian cotton was also intense. After the second session, market rumors suggested that a Japanese economic delegation had arrived in China and proposed exporting cotton to other countries. As a result, buying interest strengthened, and prices for each month reached new highs at the close of trading, with the June contract breaking through the six yuan mark. Compared to the closing prices from the previous day, the prices of tagged cotton for each month rose by one or two jiao. At the opening of the afternoon session, market sentiment shifted towards calmness and fatigue, as the yarn market was lackluster and bulls came to close their positions again. As a result, the prices for each month fell by five fen to two jiao and a half compared to the morning session. Sales included: Ta Fung, 7,700 dan; Tung Ho, 3,300 dan; Ta Chang, 4,500 dan; Tai Hing, 4,000 dan; Tung Kee, 6,900 dan; Keng Fung, 4,800 dan; Shen Chang, 2,800 dan; Ta Chang Cheng, 4,700 dan; Hsieh Cheng, 5,100 dan; Hsin Chang, 4,600 dan; Chang Ho, 4,800 dan; Heng Chang, 2,100 dan; Fu Kang, 2,300 dan; Fung Shou, 4,200 dan. Purchases included: Chin Chang, 12,800 dan; Yu Ta, 2,400 dan; Chi Fung, 2,000 dan; Heng Yih, 8,100 dan; Dah Kee, 5,300 dan; Ho Hsing, 8,200 dan; Tai Chang, 6,600 dan; Run Kang, 2,500 dan; Hsin Cheng, 2,200 dan.</p>
<p>Cotton Consumption Still Sizable</p>
<p>The current cotton consumption is still considered substantial. The transaction volume of various factories seems to be slightly less compared to the previous day, and the source remains unchanged.</p>
<p>American Cotton Has Reached One Jiao and Five Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with active trading. Prices for each month fluctuated from a decrease of one pound to an increase of four pounds due to buying from fellow traders and foreign merchants. Subsequently, profit-taking by bulls and local concerns about potential unrest led to a decline in prices. Near the close of trading, fellow traders and the public re-entered the market, with limited short selling, causing the market to rise again. There were forty-three delivery notices for the March contract, all with buyers. The cloth market was firm, but trading was quieter. The closing was extremely strong, with spot prices rising by fifteen pounds and futures prices rising by nine to twenty pounds. English cotton spot prices rose by four points, while futures prices fell by one point. Indian cotton short positions were covered, and Japanese merchants, Liverpool merchants, and futures traders made large purchases. Later, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and profit-taking by bulls, the market retreated. Dhollera rose by 3.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 3 to 4 rupees, and Bengal Desi rose by 3.75 to 4 rupees. Original telegram recorded on the left (dated 16th).</p>
<p>Also, according to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the 17th was: Bengal Desi at 250 rupees, up 2.25 rupees; Oomra at 236.5 rupees; Dhollera at 199.25 rupees, all up by 2 rupees.</p>
<p>Domestic and Foreign Yarn, Cotton, and Piece Goods Show Mixed Trends</p>

<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Current Month Futures Flour Plummets</p>
<p>All Due to Sluggish Sales of Spot Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday in the flour market, after the opening bell in the morning, prices for all months initially remained flat, followed by a sharp fall in near-term contracts. Quotations for foreign wheat showed Chicago up by two or three jiao and Canada up by three, four, or six jiao. With the continuous rise in foreign wheat prices upon opening, market confidence should have been stable. Therefore, the opening price for the current month was still between nine jiao and two fen. However, the long positions for the current month were already heavily burdened and difficult to reverse. With a large number of contracts, closing them out took time. On the other hand, the majority of short positions were held by factories. With slow actual sales, covering positions was naturally difficult. As a result, after opening, prices fell sharply, reaching as low as eight jiao, eight fen, and two and a half li at the close. The April contract saw a small increase of three or four fen, while the July and August contracts saw a small increase of two or three fen. Upon opening in the afternoon, market sentiment became even more uncertain. The current month fell to a minimum of eight jiao and a half, but fortunately, factories covered their positions together, stabilizing the market slightly and recovering two fen from the lowest point. The April contract also experienced a wild decline due to sell-offs, reaching a minimum of eight jiao, eight fen, and two and a half li. The July and August contracts also rebounded slightly due to long positions being pulled in. The sharp fall in the current month was ultimately due to sluggish sales of spot goods and an excessive number of contracts, which made it impossible for long positions to resist.</p>
<p>New Wheat Still Able to Hold Steady</p>
<p>Recent Spot Wheat Prices All Retreat Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw foreign wheat quotations rise again by two or three jiao to four or six jiao. At the opening, prices for the current month fell sharply due to its proximity to delivery and the extreme weakness of the flour market, leading to natural uncertainty. With few transactions, prices also fell sharply. The opening and closing prices for the first two sessions were both six yuan, three jiao, and a half. The April contract also saw a small decline to three jiao, four or five fen. Contracts for June and beyond were generally stable. Upon opening in the afternoon, the market fell again by two or three fen due to the large number of sell orders from retail long positions. Only the Tianjin merchant long positions remained unmoved. The new wheat market remained stable, while the spot wheat market saw a gradual decline. Prices for each type of wheat also fell by three or four fen. Open-kernel Anhui wheat was priced at six yuan, three jiao, and four fen, Jiangbei wheat at six yuan, three jiao, and three fen, with a price difference of two jiao and eight fen, Shaoxing wheat at six yuan, one jiao, and five or six fen, Tiantai wheat at six yuan, two jiao, and two fen, and Chongming wheat at six yuan, one jiao, and a half, all purchased by Shen Ta and Fu Hsin at 1,500 bags each.</p>
<p>River Rice Prices Remain Firm in Morning Session</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than forty merchants arrived from various provinces, bringing approximately 8,100 to 8,200 shi of goods. Due to the strong winds the night before, few boats arrived in the early morning, leading to firm market sentiment and high asking prices from sellers. However, as more boats arrived in quick succession near noon, the situation quickly stabilized. For example, the price of thick japonica rice only improved by five fen. Thin indica rice, on the other hand, had slightly more average costs. Although there were merchants from both northern and southern Jiangsu buying, the volume was only 1,500 to 1,600 bags, so the market situation remained lackluster. Du Yang pointy rice and Yin Yuan rice saw no change.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, fifteen or sixteen boats arrived from various provinces downstream. The market saw strong sales of various goods. Due to the scarcity of boats and decreasing supply from downstream, the high-quality white japonica rice prices remained firm, while medium- and lower-quality rice tightened up by several fen to one jiao. Thin indica rice from Yan Jin and Xi'an provinces was actively traded, and sales in this district were also active, leading to a strong and positive price trend. Early rice prices also remained tightly held, and Yang Du Bu pointy rice also showed signs of improvement. Customer-specific pointy rice remained steady, while white Yuan and other goods maintained stable prices.</p>
<p>Guangdong Merchants Resume Buying Customer's Coarse Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of customer's indica rice remained strong, with more than 10,000 bags arriving daily. However, Guangdong merchants became more active yesterday, purchasing nearly 20,000 bags of various coarse and machine-milled rice. With increased sales to Guangdong, market sentiment improved again, and cargo owners were unwilling to sell cheaply. Coarse rice was eagerly sought by Guangdong merchants, causing prices to rise by one jiao. Machine-milled rice also rose by five fen to nearly one jiao. If Guangdong sales continue to be active today and tomorrow, the market may need to increase prices again. A total of 18,250 bags of Jiangxi rice, 1,250 bags of Hunan rice, 3,000 bags of sandbank coarse rice, and 1,250 bags of Nanling coarse rice were sold throughout the day.</p>
<p>Standard Soybean Oil Cake Shows Little Fluctuation. Standard soybean oil cake prices have been fluctuating slightly in recent days, but the changes have been minimal. Standard soybean oil has only seen increases or decreases of five fen to one or two jiao, while soybean cake has only seen changes of a few li to one fen. Yellow soybeans have also only seen increases or decreases of one, two, or three fen. In recent days, actual sales of yellow soybeans and soybean cake have been sluggish, and most merchants are taking a wait-and-see approach. Although there has been activity in covering and closing positions in standard soybean oil, new transactions have not been active. Based on current spot prices in Shanghai, standard prices need to be reduced. However, the market sentiment in Dalian is very strong, and telegrams from yesterday and the day before yesterday continued to show upward trends. As a result, trading firms are very hesitant to sell, and the market has been able to hold its ground. Yesterday, standard soybean oil prices were close to those in the distant ports, with increases and decreases of five fen each. Soybean cake sales were sluggish with merchants holding back, with small decreases of half a fen to one fen. Standard soybean prices showed no major fluctuations.</p>
<p>Changzhou Pu Li Factory Cake Enters the Market</p>
<p>Yesterday, the oil cake market saw the entry of another oil pressing factory, namely the Changzhou Pu Li Oil Pressing Factory, which entrusted Chang Yi Heng to manage its sales. It is reported that the factory has traditionally specialized in producing nine-jin small soybean cakes, selling them in various inland villages. This year, it suddenly expanded its business to compete for sales in the Nanyang region. Yesterday, sample cakes were already on display in the market. The trademark of the main brand cake is "Changzhou Pu Li," while the third brand is "Pu Li," the fourth brand is "Fat Character," and the fifth brand is "Grain Character." The weight of the cakes is the same as those produced by factories in this port. Industry insiders claim that the quality of the sample cakes is acceptable. However, since the factory is located inland, there will be delays in transportation, which will inevitably create a price difference in the market in the future. Yesterday, the soybean cake market saw a decline in sales volume, and market sentiment was mediocre. Prices were still held at the original levels, but only 2,500 pieces of goods traded in the combined sales of merchant sales and broker sales. Therefore, the future trend may not be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Government Bond Trading Slightly More Active</p>
<p>Ninety-Six Bonds Have Recovered to Their Previous Market Price</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange saw a relatively stable market situation. Although large holders continued to sell, the appetite of buyers gradually increased. With the impending realization of the reorganization of the Central Bank into a Preparatory Bank, the reserve requirements of various banks will increase, leading to a substantial absorption of government bonds. Therefore, the long positions for the current month are extremely stable, and the future market situation should be slightly more active. Ninety-six bonds have recovered to the horizontal line and should continue to move towards stability. Although the overall situation yesterday was still characterized by uncertainty, the trend has shown signs of slight firmness. Only the seller of fifty-four long-term Class A bonds continued to sell for three consecutive sessions, amounting to hundreds of thousands, which stopped at the close of trading. As a result, many retail long positions also sold off their holdings. Short positions are still holding on. Class A bonds have been brewing without any upward momentum for the past few months. Now that fifty-four's sales have been exhausted, there should be a rebound in the near future. As a result of the market situation, most bonds rose by five fen, one jiao, or one jiao and a half, while a few also fell slightly by five fen or one jiao. Class A bonds fell by another jiao, and ninety-six bonds retreated by two jiao. The total transaction volume was 5,345,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>Gold Standard Still Faces Selling Pressure</p>
<p>The gold market initially rose yesterday due to rising gold prices in overseas silver markets in both England and America. The price of raw gold in London rose by half a penny. The Central Bank's official exchange rate announcement showed no change in either England or America, and the customs gold unit rose by two li. The official exchange rate for the gold standard was announced to rise to 1,157 yuan and four jiao. However, the opening price in the morning was lower, and there was a sudden surge due to a lack of supply after the opening. Spot market firms took advantage of the high prices to supply gold, but the market was still pressured by selling pressure at noon. It is feared that the trend will be difficult to reverse due to the lack of stimulus for spot prices. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 1,155 yuan, down four jiao from the previous close. The quotes from Tung Fung Yu Qia Fung and Yung Na remained the same.

HSBC's official exchange rate showed no change in either England or America, and the balance tax rose again by 75 points.

The Association set the price for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 22 yuan, 8 jiao, and a half for spot goods, 7 yuan, 4 jiao, and a half for transit goods, and the price for Dong White No. 489, as well as the local factory's soft white sugar, Zhen Kee's Golden Heart, and Da Hua, remained unchanged. The sales of goods from established firms were slightly active, with Guangdong and Hong Kong merchants offering over a thousand bags of Hainan brown sugar at 13 yuan and 2 jiao, while Chaozhou merchants offered 150 bags of soft brown sugar at 15 yuan, another 72 bags at 14 yuan and 4 jiao, and Xinghua merchants offered over a hundred bags of Da Gong powdered white sugar at 19 yuan and 3 jiao, Ming Jing brown sugar at 14 yuan and 4 jiao, and Jing brown sugar at 14 yuan, for a total of over two hundred bags traded, a small increase of several jiao.</p>
<p>For the joint stock company, yesterday was the second week for bidding on Guangdong sugar, with a total quota of over nine thousand bags. The company sold 120 bags of Shun De Factory's Five Sheep coarse white sugar at 22 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, another 215 bags from Dongguan at 22 yuan and 6 jiao, and 200 pieces of No. 16 medium granulated white sugar at 18 yuan and 1 jiao.</p>

<p>Japanese and American Silk Prices Rise Sharply Again Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Silk Market is Holding its Price More Firmly</p>
<p>New Silk Saw Slight Sales Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, the international silk market saw sharp price increases in both Japan and the United States. New York Standard Silk saw a recent rise of five fen and futures rose three fen. Yokohama's spot and futures prices initially rose only slightly by five yuan, but in the afternoon, prices for near and far-month contracts rose sharply by approximately 10 yuan to 20 yuan. The Shanghai silk market has been increasingly firm in the past two days. Due to the scarcity of contracts, manufacturers are holding their prices more firmly, which has led to a decrease in silk transactions. The same is true for customer silk. Yesterday, firms such as Lian Na saw slight sales of new silk. For example, the price of White Factory's seven-eight grade straight-reeled silk was 760 yuan, an increase of approximately 10 yuan compared to the previous price. A total of 90 bales were traded. Sales of silk from other Indian factories have been very quiet recently, and even if there are sales, the volume is small.</p>
<h3>Methods of Preparing Income Tax Returns (10)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>(4) Report Form for Withholding Second Category Salary and Remuneration Income (with List) (Continued)</p>
<p>(5) Monthly Payable Amount, Monthly Actual Income. The "Monthly Payable Amount" refers to the fixed amount of salary and remuneration payable for the current month. For all income in this category calculated on a quarterly, semi-annual, annual, or monthly basis, the monthly payable amount can be calculated and recorded in this list. For those calculated on a weekly basis, four weeks are considered one month. Income from short-term labor and piecework wages should also be recorded as the monthly payable amount first. The "Monthly Actual Income" refers to the actual amount of salary and remuneration paid for the current month. This applies to cases where salaries and remuneration are issued at a discount, or a portion is advanced through a loan, or a reduction is made due to leave, or an increase is received due to weekend or night work. The actual income often differs from the fixed payable amount. Therefore, the "Monthly Actual Income" column should be recorded with the actual amount paid. The total of this column must correspond to the total salary and remuneration payment for the current month in the expense ledger. According to Article 16 of the Implementing Regulations, the scope of this category of income is very broad. All monetary payments received from occupations and work are included. Furthermore, according to Article 7 of the Regulations for this category, if the income from business-related salaries and remuneration is in the form of goods or securities, it should be calculated at the market price at the time of issuance, converted into legal currency. Therefore, in the "Monthly Actual Income" column, all earned income should be recorded in monetary amounts. The so-called directors' fees, staff office expenses, and various subsidies are all considered second-category income. Although Article 4 of the Guidelines for this category stipulates that expenses incurred by civil servants on official duty are not within the scope of salaries and remuneration and are not taxed, self-employed individuals and others engaged in various businesses cannot receive the same tax-exempt treatment for their office expense subsidies or entertainment expense subsidies. Moreover, according to the Ministry of Finance's interpretation, ordinary housing and food allowances, i.e., meal and accommodation subsidies provided by employers to employees, except for workers and low-level shop assistants whose monthly salaries and remuneration are less than 30 yuan, must also be included in the salary and remuneration income and recorded in the "Monthly Actual Income" column. Taxpayers receiving such salary and remuneration income, except for those with business establishments who may deduct the appropriate expenses according to Article 17 of the Implementing Regulations, with the remaining amount being the taxable amount, all withholding income taxes listed in this list are based on the actual amount of various income for the current month as the tax withholding amount. It has no relation to the expenses controlled by the taxpayer for that income. This is the general rule of income tax adopting the source of taxation. However, according to Article 10 of the Guidelines for this category, workers' personal insurance expenses may be deducted from the salary and remuneration. This should be noted in the "Remarks" column so that it can be deducted from the actual income for the current month when calculating the income tax payable. As for those exempt from income tax for the second category of income listed in Article 2 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, they should not be included in the "Monthly Payable Amount" and "Monthly Actual Income."</p>
<p>(6) Income Tax Payable. The income tax payable should be calculated according to the tax rates stipulated in Article 5 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, based on the monthly payable amount. The monthly payable income amount varies, and the applicable tax rate also varies, ranging from 5 per mille for a monthly average income of 30 yuan to a progressive tax rate of up to 200 per mille. If the monthly actual income is the same as the monthly payable amount, the tax amount is calculated based on the monthly payable amount. If the monthly actual income is less than the monthly payable amount, a tax amount is first calculated based on the payable amount, and then the tax amount is converted based on the ratio of the actual income to the payable amount and recorded in the "Income Tax Payable" column. If the monthly actual income is greater than the payable amount, it seems appropriate to directly calculate the income tax payable based on the payable amount. The worker's personal insurance expenses that should be deducted according to Article 10 of the Guidelines for this category can be deducted from the monthly actual income before calculating the income tax. For each taxpayer, during each service period, i.e., within each month, if there are multiple types of income, the actual income should be totaled first, and the total income should be observed to correspond to a certain level in the tax rate of this category, and then the income tax payable should be calculated. For example, if a monthly salary and director's fee are paid to the same person, they should be added together to determine the total amount of income actually paid for the current month.</p>
<p>(7) Remarks. The purpose of setting up the "Remarks" column is to record matters other than the above-mentioned items for reference. Regarding this list, matters related to supplementary tax can be reported in the "Remarks" column. However, the calculation of supplementary tax is extremely complicated. It is necessary to first list the tax already paid and calculate the monthly payable amount and monthly actual income of the tax already paid. Then, the income to be added now should be listed, and the tax payable should be calculated based on the total amount of previous and current income. Only then can the monthly supplementary tax amount and the total amount of supplementary tax payable be calculated. Therefore, the "Remarks" position in this list does not seem sufficient for circulation. When other items are used to offset salaries and remuneration in the form of securities or goods, and when the difference between the monthly payable amount and the monthly actual income is too large, the reasons should also be noted in the "Remarks" column.</p>
<p>The above is the method of preparing the income tax withholding list for self-employed individuals and others engaged in various businesses. The procedure can be said to be complicated. As for the preparation method of the report form itself, i.e., the second category salary and remuneration income report form (Type C withholding report form), the procedure is extremely simple. First, the month, name of the withholding and reporting agency, business, and address are listed. What is filled in is the same as what is listed in the above list. Then, the total amount of salary remuneration paid by the agency this month and the total amount of income tax withheld by the agency are listed. These two amounts are carried over from the final total in the list. The intention is to report the total amount listed in the list. The detailed information of this category of income tax withholding has been seen in the list. This report form is just a summary of its total. After the totals are extracted, the tax payable is paid to the receiving agency to obtain a receipt. The date of payment, name of the receiving agency, and receipt number are filled in the report form. The withholding responsible person signs and affixes a seal, and the date of filling in the report is noted. Together with the list, it is sent to the local competent collection agency. The withholding procedure for this category of income tax is complete. Therefore, in terms of the preparation procedure, the withholding of this category of income tax should focus on the content of the list, while the report form itself is very simple.</p>

<h3>Sima Rangju</h3>
<p>— Wang Rongnian</p>
<p>——Resisting Enemies and Defending Against Insults – Illegality is Unacceptable——</p>
<p>During the Spring and Autumn Period, there was a country called Qi. When Duke Jing of Qi was in power, the national crisis was very serious because the states of Jin and Yan invaded at the same time. Jin attacked A and Zhen, and Yan invaded the area north of the river. Qi sent large armies to meet the enemy on both fronts, but because its military strength was weak, it suffered repeated defeats. Jin and Yan gradually invaded deeper, becoming more and more threatening. This worried Duke Jing of Qi, who immediately summoned his ministers to a meeting to discuss how to resist the enemy. Some ministers had no suggestions, others advocated ceding territory to stop the war, and still others … Finally, a minister named Yan Ying said to Duke Jing of Qi, “If Your Majesty wants to resist Qi, you need a capable general to lead the army.” Duke Jing asked, “Who can take on this role?” Yan Ying replied, “I know someone named Tian Rangju. He is a descendant of Tian Wan and is intelligent and capable. His conduct commands respect, and his military prowess can repel the enemy.” Duke Jing, upon hearing this, immediately ordered Tian Rangju to come to the palace to discuss military matters. Rangju, upon receiving the order, quickly went to the palace. Duke Jing said to him, “Our country is in a very bad situation right now. We have been defeated repeatedly in battles against the enemy because our military strength is weak. Therefore, I have summoned you to lead the army and appoint you as general.” Rangju, knowing that he was being asked to lead the army into battle, hurriedly kowtowed in thanks. Duke Jing then inquired about the strategy for attacking. As he was leaving the palace, Rangju said, “I have a request to make of Your Majesty.” Duke Jing asked, “What is it? Tell me quickly!” Rangju said, “My origin is very humble, and others do not respect me. Now that I have military power and have become a general, I will have no way to deal with those in the army who do not obey me. I would like Your Majesty to send a minister who is trusted by Your Majesty and respected by the people to be a supervisor. This way, the people and the soldiers will obey.” Duke Jing of Qi thought that what he said made sense, so he sent Zhuang Jia to take on this role.</p>
<p>Rangju left the palace and went to visit Zhuang Jia. After they met, they discussed military matters for a while and finally agreed to meet at the military camp at noon on the day of departure. Then they parted.</p>
<p>Time passed quickly, and the appointed day arrived. Rangju, because he had an appointment with Zhuang Jia, was afraid of being late, so he hurried to the military camp before noon to wait. At that time, there were no clocks, so Rangju specially set up a clepsydra to measure time (a clepsydra is an ancient instrument for measuring time, with water in the middle and holes that drip water, which can be used to measure time), waiting for Zhuang Jia.</p>
<p>On the day of departure, Zhuang Jia said goodbye to his relatives and friends, and each place prepared banquets to send him off. He thought that he was a favorite minister of Duke Jing of Qi, so it didn't matter at this time. Therefore, he did not rush and spent time with his relatives and friends. Noon had passed, and it was not until the sun was setting that he bid farewell to his relatives and friends and walked towards the military camp.</p>
<p>Rangju waited for Zhuang Jia in the military camp until after noon, but he still did not come. Rangju was very angry. He immediately destroyed the clepsydra and gave an encouraging speech to the soldiers in the army. Then he returned to his tent to wait for Zhuang Jia. It was not until dark that he saw Zhuang Jia slowly walking over, not caring at all. Rangju was not polite to him at all and asked directly, “Didn't we agree to meet at noon today? Why are you only coming now?” Zhuang Jia said to Rangju with a smile, “Alas, I also wanted to come earlier, but my relatives and friends thought that I was coming to the army today, so they specially prepared banquets to send me off. Therefore, I was delayed and could only come now.” Rangju said, “Our country is now facing strong enemies, and we have lost a lot of territory. Therefore, the King sent you and me to lead the army to fight. You must know that a person is very insignificant. If there is no country and he loses his support, he cannot survive alone. Therefore, everyone should love their country. When a person is ordered to serve the country, he should not take into account his personal affairs. Moreover, this matter has already made the King very anxious, and the lives of the people are tied to you. Now you have violated military discipline. What should be done?” Rangju, without waiting for him to answer, summoned the military law officer and asked, “According to military law, what should be done with those who are late for an appointment?” The military law officer replied, “They should be beheaded.” Zhuang Jia was very afraid when he heard this, so he sent someone to report to Duke Jing, asking Duke Jing to send someone to rescue him quickly. However, as soon as this person was sent away, Rangju beheaded Zhuang Jia and sent someone to carry Zhuang Jia's head to announce it throughout the military camp. When the soldiers saw it, they were all afraid and said, “We must abide by the law in the future.”</p>
<p>After a while, the messenger sent by Duke Jing of Qi to rescue Zhuang Jia arrived. He hurriedly rode his horse into the military camp, and when he saw Rangju, he announced Qi King's order to pardon Zhuang Jia. Rangju said, "When a general is outside, he can not accept the orders of the monarch." He turned to ask the military law officer, "In the military camp, it is not allowed to ride horses, now the king's messenger rides horses into the military camp, what should be done?" The military law officer replied, "Beheaded!" The messenger heard this, scared into a ball, begging for mercy could not say a word. Rangju pondered for a while before saying, "The king's messenger, can not be killed." So he sent someone to kill the two followers who came with the messenger, and let the messenger go back. Rangju this time also sent someone to carry the head, to show it to everyone in the military camp, to persuade the soldiers to abide by the law.</p>
<p>From then on, the arrogant soldiers and brave generals all obeyed military discipline and did not dare to neglect. But Rangju did not just use military law to scare people, he also understood the importance of both grace and power, so he treated people very well, and personally inquired about all the soldiers' food, clothing, shelter, etc. He also took out the food and supplies obtained by the general, and shared them equally with the soldiers, not willing to enjoy them alone, so the soldiers all thanked him and were willing to sacrifice themselves to repay the country. Even the weak soldiers asked to risk their lives to fight the enemy for the country. When the states of Jin and Yan heard this news, they were afraid that they would not be able to defeat Qi, so they hurriedly withdrew their troops. When Rangju's troops arrived at the battlefield, the enemy troops had already retreated without a trace. Thus, Rangju recovered the lost territory without any effort. On the day he returned in triumph, Duke Jing took a group of ministers to welcome him in the suburbs, and praised him. Later, the state appointed Rangju as the Grand Marshal, and later generations called him Marshal Rangju. Since then, the Tian family has occupied a very important position in the state of Qi.</p>

<p>— Li Su</p>
<p>—Stepping Forward When the Country is in Trouble; Calmly Returning to the Fields After Success—</p>
<p>Nistas, the new star, is a strong middle-aged man or older.</p>
<p>He had previously held various important positions in the Roman government, repeatedly holding high office; the whole country recognized him as an intelligent, upright, and capable good official. But after he retired, he did not retain any official airs, and everything was the same as the most ordinary and law-abiding farmers. He originally had a little money, but he spent a lot because he was enthusiastic about public works; finally, he only had that small plot of land not far from the city of Rome, and a sum of money just enough to maintain a simple life. He and his wife left Rome and returned to their own farm to live the life of ordinary people.</p>
<p>As the morning sun just showed its smiling face, Nistas, the new star, carried his hoe, raised his rake, and hummed a tune, cheerfully walking to the fields to work. No matter what position he was in, only work could make him happy, and only meaningful work could make him feel the fullness of life and imagine the fruit of life that would be formed, thus increasing his infinite hope and the power of survival, and thus making him even more energetic. He was no different from ordinary farmers, except that he had a little more spiritual gain. His wife took care of the housework with great care and was a typical virtuous wife. The couple worked together and lived a very peaceful and happy life. Although it was a small garden, it was enough to supply their simple needs.</p>
<p>The people of Rome had not forgotten that Nistas, the new star, was an intelligent and fair gentleman, although he was no longer a rich man. The poor people living near his farm, whenever they had any difficulties or disputes, who didn't run to him for advice? He didn't mind the trouble at all, and even the most trivial things, he tried his best to deal with them for them and solve them, as if they were all his own affairs. As long as he could do it, he was happy to help, because the more opportunities he had to contribute his own efforts, the more he felt the mutual kindness between human beings, and the more he felt that he was not a useless person.</p>
<p>"Is this the home of Nistas, the new star? I was sent by the Roman government, and I have something to see him about." One day, a soldier suddenly came and stood at the door asking Nistas' wife.</p>
<p>"That's right, but he went to the fields to work. Please wait a while, and I'll send someone to call him back."</p>
<p>As soon as Nistas, the new star, heard that a soldier had brought an important summons from the government, he ran home in three steps and two steps.</p>
<p>As soon as the soldier saw him, he said:</p>
<p>"Hello, Nistas, the new star? I have come here in the name of the government to ask you to go to Rome immediately."</p>
<p>"Quickly bring me my cloak, because I have to go right away and can't delay!" he said to his wife. She brought the clothes, and Nistas, the new star, while putting on his cloak, told her not to worry if he didn't come back at night.</p>
<p>He and the soldier rode their horses and flew towards the city of Rome.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Rome, Nistas, the new star, saw a large group of senators waiting for him to come. He guessed that something serious must have happened, and quickly jumped off his horse and walked towards the crowd, who welcomed him very warmly.</p>
<p>After Nistas, the new star, returned the salute, he said:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen senators, you sent someone to call me to Rome immediately. What is the drive?"</p>
<p>One of the senators spoke on behalf of everyone:</p>
<p>"Alas, Nistas, the new star, you know that Rome is at war with the mountain bandits. They come down from their mountain nests and advance towards Rome, burning and looting everywhere, killing many of our compatriots. We sent a brave and elite army to meet them, thinking that we could always eliminate the enemy. But yesterday we saw five people riding horses towards the city of Rome from the city walls, and only those five were able to return."</p>
<p>"What's going on? Can't our Roman soldiers resist the mountain bandits?" Nistas asked. He was both surprised and anxious in his heart.</p>
<p>The old senator frowned tightly and said sadly:</p>
<p>"The soldiers who returned told us that when our army was advancing along a narrow mountain path from a small mountain valley, they were suddenly attacked. They wanted to continue to advance, but found that the road had been blocked by a solid stone wall, and behind the wall was a powerful enemy army. There was no way forward, so they had no choice but to retreat, but the rear road was also blocked by the enemy using the same method, truly so-called "advancing and retreating in a dilemma". At this moment, our soldiers were violently attacked by the enemy army ambushed on the high mountains on both sides of the small path. Countless large stones rolled down from the high places towards our men and horses. Finally, more than half of the casualties had already occurred, and ten people had to risk breaking through the battle line and rushing back to Rome to ask for reinforcements. Only five of those ten people escaped with their lives."</p>
<p>"This situation is too serious," Nistas said, "What do you want me to do?"</p>
<p>"We are asking you to come because we know that within Rome, there is no one more experienced and capable in dealing with war and peace than you are now. Please lead the army we can muster to resist the enemy."</p>
<p>After Nistas, the new star, was ordered, he immediately prepared an attack plan. He ordered the five soldiers who had escaped to carefully and thoroughly draw out the mountain area, the battle terrain, where the small mountain valley was, where the narrow path up the mountain was, and where the stone wall blocking the mountain road was. He gathered his men and told them:</p>
<p>"Dear brothers, we have an army trapped in the valley ahead, and they are still fighting for the survival of the Roman people in desperation! I hope you can help to rescue those brave men from danger. Are you all willing to go?"</p>
<p>"Willing! Willing! This is our responsibility!" The crowd responded in unison.</p>
<p>So Nistas, the new star, gladly led his subordinates and chose the most remote and dangerous road that few people had traveled to advance. They held their breaths and walked cautiously, and finally climbed to a peak higher than the one occupied by the enemy, shouting loudly. Those mountain bandits suddenly looked up and saw the Roman soldiers above them, and they were immediately panicked and ran around the mountain, each fleeing for their lives. Many were killed. The rest who were blocking the road in the valley below also collapsed and retreated. The trapped Roman soldiers were fortunate to be reborn and forgot their fatigue and cheered.</p>
<p>After a few days, the new and old armies gathered together and followed the leading leader Nistas, the new star, back to the city of Rome. In those sixteen days, Nistas, the new star, was the only great man in all of Rome. He saved a Roman army and saved Rome itself. When he took off his helmet and changed his war robe, he felt very happy in his heart, because he had done another part of the national duty in his life. What made him even happier was that he had not died in battle this time, and he was still alive to wait for the opportunity to contribute himself, if the country needed him.</p>
<p>The senators and the Roman people, because of the achievements of Nistas, the new star, this time, were willing to recommend him as the leader of all of Rome. But, when they expressed their love and offered such a glorious high position, he thought in his heart, now that there is someone who can rule Rome, why should I take credit for a little bit of due diligence? My service to the country is out of love for the country, do I hope to get high officials and generous salaries? So he resolutely refused, and he said:</p>
<p>"I am very grateful for the kindness of my compatriots, but my only wish in my life is to return to my own farm and be a law-abiding farmer. I think you love me, and you must not force me." After he finished speaking, he smiled contentedly, jumped on his own white horse, and with the sound of hooves, he went home by himself.</p>
<p>The next day, as the morning sun just showed its smiling face, Nistas, the new star, again carried his hoe, raised his rake, and hummed a tune, more cheerfully walking to the fields to work.</p>
<h3>Lü He Fenke (1632-1723)</h3>
<p>— Wu Bixiong</p>
<p>(Continued from Issue 49)</p>
<p>—The First Person to Know of Microorganisms—</p>
<p>In 1723, this scientist, who had worked diligently for seventy years, bid farewell to the world. He was already ninety-one years old. At the end of his life, he still never forgot his work, asking his old friends to translate his last two letters into Latin and send them to the Royal Society of London.</p>
<p>The story of the first discoverer of microorganisms thus comes to an end. Later, those who continued to study microorganisms included the radiant master Spallanzani, the thousandfold imaginative Pasteur, and Robert Kode, who brought clear efficacy to mankind by fighting against microorganisms that harm people; their names and the names of other microorganism hunters are much more well-known than Lü Fenke today; but none of them was as sincere, surprisingly accurate, and possessed as sound a mind as this Dutch tradesman, despite his lack of methods. He was the pioneer of microorganisms! He was the leader of the generally famous successors! Without him, microbiology would have taken several more decades to begin its history.</p>
<p>Lü Fenke's opportunity came because in his hometown, there was a biologist named Graf, who was a corresponding member of the Royal Society because of his unique research on the human ovary. This biologist appreciated Lü's research and introduced him to the Royal Society. The Royal Society was greatly astonished by the mysteries under his lens.</p>
<p>Many fundamental scientific discoveries seem unbelievably simple to later generations. For thousands of years, humans encountered these so-called "things right in front of their eyes" but always overlooked them. We are the same with microorganisms. Now, almost anyone can leisurely admire the movement and somersaults of microorganisms under a microscope, and first-year medical students can point out to us the spreaders of various terrible diseases. Who would have thought that Lü Fenke's discovery of this secret came from hard work! With a desire for perfection, he repeatedly made hundreds of lenses, and he examined everything like a madman with the enthusiasm of discovering novelty. But this seemingly crazy work was a necessary preparation for the memorable day he would later create!</p>
<p>The memorable day was when he used a fine glass tube to suck up a drop of rainwater and observed it. What he discovered that day became the opening chapter of the entire story of mythical deeds, and the theory of microorganisms—bacteriology—records this type of story. Lü Fenke had "observation madness"; only a weirdo like him would have thought of using his lens to look at such a boring and ordinary thing—a drop of rainwater, countless raindrops falling from the sky! What else could be in the water besides water?</p>
<p>He took a glass tube drawn into a fine thread in the flame and went into the garden, sucked up a drop of rainwater in the water tank, returned to the laboratory, and inserted the fine glass tube into the needle of the microscope... After a short while, his daughter Maria suddenly heard her father's excited voice.</p>
<p>"Come! Haha! There are small creatures in this drop of rainwater... They are swimming... They are moving in circles! They are a thousand times smaller than anything visible to the naked eye... Come here and see! See! What I have discovered!" (End)</p>

<h3>Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees by Chanranzi</h3>
<p>— Zhao Jingshen</p>
<p>"Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees by Chanranzi" can be found in the Shuofu, Volume 32, by Ming Tao Zongyi, which includes the "Gujin Shuohai Shenji" by Ming Lu Ji. However, only eight articles are the same in both versions; the Shuofu version has sixteen articles that are not in the "Gujin Shuohai" version, all marked with "This article not seen." It seems that the engravers had once checked against "Gujin Shuohai," right? The "Gujin Shuohai" version has twenty-six articles that are not in the Shuofu version, so by piecing the two versions together, a total of fifty jokes can be obtained. The format of the two versions is also different. The Shuofu version has a separate title for each article, while the "Gujin Shuohai" version has no titles.</p>
<p>This book is also a compilation. The preface says: "Mr. Lü Juren of Donglai wrote the 'Xuanqu Lu,' all recording laughable events of the time. I have observed that there are many such things in various family miscellanies. During my leisure, I compiled a collection and named it 'Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees.' It not only provides a laugh for the reader but also supplements the omissions of 'Xuanqu Lu.' Written by Chanranzi on the day of the Beginning of Spring in the first year of Yanyou." It can be seen that this book is "compiled" and "collected" from "various family miscellanies."</p>
<p>The "Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao" believes that "Shuofu contains this book, titled 'Song Yuan Huai,'" and thus concludes that Chanranzi is the pen name of Song Yuan Huai. However, the Ming edition of Shuofu only writes Yuan □□□. What the "Siku Quanshu Zongmu Tiyao" says may refer to the error-ridden edition compiled by Yao Antao during the Qing Shunzhi Dinghai period, right? Therefore, I believe the "Tiyao's" words are unreliable. I believe that Chanranzi should be a person from the Yuan Dynasty, or at the earliest, a person from the late Song Dynasty and early Yuan Dynasty. There are two pieces of evidence: First, the Ming edition of Shuofu titles it as written by a Yuan person. Second, the preface states the year as "the first year of Yanyou." Yanyou is the second reign title of Yuan Renzong. The first year of Yanyou is 1314; the Song Dynasty fell in 1279. The "Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees" was compiled more than thirty years after the fall of the Song Dynasty. It is certainly possible for the compiler to have witnessed the transition from Song to Yuan. As for why Song Dynasty events are not marked as Song, there is also an explanation: because Song Dynasty events are all compiled from Song Dynasty notes and written directly as they were, there is no need to add the word "Song." Moreover, as a Song Dynasty remnant, he did not consider himself a Yuan person during the Yuan Dynasty, so the word "Song" could be omitted even more.</p>
<p>The editor's selection perspective is quite similar to Xie Zhaozhi's "Wuzazu." For example, the second article in the Shuofu version discussing the "Analects" is the forty-fourth article in "Wuzazu," the sixteenth article about placing a hat on a monk's head is the one hundred and twenty-third article in "Wuzazu," the nineteenth article about exchanging sheep books is the ninety-third article in "Wuzazu," and the twenty-fourth article about the thief's poem is the forty-ninth article in "Wuzazu." The "Shuohai" version also has three articles that are the same as the sixteenth, one hundred and fifteenth, and one hundred and twenty-second articles in "Wuzazu." Among these seven identical articles, perhaps some were indirectly taken from "Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees" by "Wuzazu," right?</p>
<p>The thirteenth article of "Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees," "Bird Language," became the form of "Xuetao Xiaoshu" in the hands of Jiang Jinzhi. Here are both articles listed next to each other to examine the transformation of jokes:</p>
<p>"Wang Jinggong once drank with a guest and liked to extract phrases from Confucian classics to make bird language orders. The swallow said: 'To know is to know, to not know is to not know, this is knowing.' For a long time, no one could answer. Liu Gongfu suddenly said, 'May I extract words from a sentence?' He then made a pigeon order, saying: 'Sell or not sell, sell.' All the guests laughed." ("Anecdotes for Slapping One's Knees") "Gongye Chang understands bird language. Once, Confucius heard a dove cooing and said, 'What is it saying?' He replied, 'It says, 'Not a wine vessel, not a wine vessel.'' He also heard a swallow speaking and said, 'What is it saying?' He replied, 'It says, 'To know is to know, to not know is to not know, this is knowing.''" ("Xuetao Xiaoshu")</p>
<p>Wang Jinggong and Liu Gongfu have transformed into Confucius and Gongye Chang, which is quite interesting.</p>
<h3>"Service and Self-Cultivation" (Continued from Issue 96)</h3>
<p>— Li Hantian</p>
<p>Physical cultivation is a basic condition for youth, not only a personal issue but also related to the future of the national cause. The so-called physical cultivation, its way is also very simple, that is, from the relationship between ordinary clothing, food, housing, sports, holidays, diseases, etc., and health, that is, how to seek to reach the realm of health. For example, the purpose, material, washing style, etc., of clothing, the nutritional components of food, the location, light, air, and windows of housing, the selection of various aspects of sports and their methods, common sense of diseases, hygiene, and prevention of infectious diseases, etc., are all very important.</p>
<p>The third is the problem of career, career outlook, and leadership qualifications. Career issues such as job selection criteria, the difficulty of getting a job, the way to get a job, the method of trial work, research on changing jobs, the mistakes of unemployment, the method of reemployment, the key to promotion, and the study of success are all described in detail according to the actual situation of vocational services.</p>
<p>Those engaged in vocational work, for career as well have a life outlook, the primary thing is a consistent way of dealing with people and things. Everywhere, remember the ideas of "what," "what," and "how." What are the characters in the vocational world like? How does fate say that it is difficult for a career to progress? The differences and mutual relationships between labor, compensation, and capital, discovering the greatest happiness from the profession itself, and eliminating its suffering. What the world calls happiness and suffering is mostly false, so special attention should be paid to the basic conditions of happiness. Occupation is service, which lies in doing it practically, not just relying on talking. In the face of matters, the mind should be cold, the blood should be hot, the emotions should be hot, and there should be a sense of proportion in dealing with events and resisting. Achieve a neutral life. What is the fundamental difference between individualism and non-individualism in the vocational world? The key points of a career outlook are to first know what life is? How does the degree of change between life outlook and society? All need to have a definite understanding.</p>
<p>Each section on leadership qualifications is also described concisely and accurately. How to be a leader? The leader's recruitment of people, the distribution of work, the coordination of opinions, the design and leadership of the outline, the handling of emergencies, the cultivation of talents, etc., must have unique talents to be competent, so the leader's talent, knowledge, and morality must be more deeply cultivated than ordinary people.</p>
<p>The above is a microcosm of this book, which is not only relied on by young people in vocational supplementary schools to supplement vocational skills, but also a way to study the essentials of being a human being. Mr. He Qingru introduced this book, saying: "Service and self-cultivation can be regarded as a guide to the life of young people... If young people can follow the path indicated, adapt to their personal characteristics, and follow it earnestly, it can guarantee success in their careers and effectiveness in their lives. Even middle-aged people may as well get the same benefits from this book."</p>
<p>Mr. He's words are very pertinent. Although this book was aimed at young people in vocational supplementary schools at the time, it can actually be used as a textbook for practical self-cultivation citizens for ordinary people in general. This book explains principles thoroughly, selects materials innovatively, and the author uses lively words to list many practical principles regarding the above, based on his life experience and referring to the words and deeds of philosophers from ancient and modern China and abroad. Compared with reading those outdated and empty books on self-cultivation, it is really more beneficial. In short, this book has the function of improving and guiding the ideological life, knowledge, and work of young people. (End)</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Military Expansion and Destruction</h3>
<p>— Fang</p>
<p>Yesterday, I saw in the newspaper that the French Minister of Defense Daladier gave a speech, saying that the international expansion of armaments is sufficient to prove the necessity of France issuing national defense bonds. For example, since Germany estimated its occupation of the Rhineland region, it has trained more than one million soldiers and created armored divisions equipped with artillery for bombing tanks. Its air force and navy have also been reorganized, and the scale is grand. Italy is also making every effort to develop its air force and navy. The Soviet Union's permanent army is estimated to be more than 1.3 million. In addition, there are thousands of tanks and thousands of aircraft, and its powerful navy is under construction. Other countries such as Poland and the Little Entente are also making great efforts to increase their armaments. Switzerland recently raised national defense bonds in less than a few hours. Even the United Kingdom, which has always been most enthusiastic about reducing armaments, has recently decided to spend 16 billion francs within five years for national defense. Naturally, a country must have a large military preparation in order to stand on its own feet and exist in the world, especially when the great powers are rectifying their armies and expanding their armaments to a fever pitch, it is not enough to survive without expanding armaments.</p>
<p>But they want to expand their armaments, and we are expanding our armaments. They want to recover their colonies, and we want to seize new territories. Therefore, all the national power, financial resources, and material resources of the country are sacrificed in one fell swoop in the expansion of armaments. In the end, the weak will not be able to survive and will be destroyed, and the strong will meet an even stronger one and will be destroyed again. The destruction of the weak is no different from the destruction of Abyssinia or the civil war in Spain, which is an area for strong neighbors to test their military strength. The destruction of the strong is to spend another ten years of reproduction and ten years of training to wash away their national shame. In this way, it is not easy to protect the weak country, and how can the strong country be protected.</p>
<p>Or some are afraid that the national strength of one country is not enough to resist strong neighbors and conquer strong neighbors, so they advocate a collective security strategy, sign secret agreements with each other, and form alliances with each other. As a result, the weak are afraid of the encroachment of strong neighbors and unite with each other, and the strong are also afraid of being controlled by the weak and also unite with each other. The more solid the unity of both sides, the greater and wider the destructive power will be. Even if one side wins, the unity will be disrupted by unequal interests and mutual suspicion, and the war will last for a long time. If so, it will become a cruel world and a terrifying world, and no matter how strong or weak, it will not stop until they all perish together. Therefore, the result of military expansion must lead to destruction. This is an unavoidable truth.</p>
<p>However, I am also worried about those who actively expand their armaments. The main war weapons of the so-called military expansion now are aircraft, artillery, tanks, and warships. Among these, aircraft are the most cruel and powerful weapons. However, science is now developing rapidly. For example, Germany recently invented a death ray, thinking that once an aircraft encounters a death ray, all aircraft will become ineffective. This kind of weapon is probably only an ideal, and when it comes to the real invention period, so countries still regard aircraft as the only weapon and rush to manufacture them without sparing any effort. In case this thing is really invented, the aircraft will be useless. However, the current world is one of science. If there is this ideal, it will definitely become a reality. Therefore, today's scientists and military strategists should not think about rushing to make aircraft and tanks, but should think about how to prevent aircraft and tanks from doing so, so that the so-called modern war weapons will be useless, and the world may have a day of peace.</p>
<h3>Not Knowing the Taste of Meat</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>According to a recent survey by the Health Department of the Public Works Bureau, "In January of this year, the number of slaughters of various meats dropped sharply. Compared with the same period last year, pigs decreased by 27.36%, sheep decreased by 54.56%, and cattle decreased by 1.40%. Therefore, the work of the slaughterhouse is quite leisurely," it is said. This matter seems very ordinary, but it is worth noting! The problem is not the stagnation of meat sales itself, but the phenomenon of residents' lives reflected by it is serious.</p>
<p>Meat is one of the main foods. No matter how poor or rich, people always have to eat some. The reduction of meat consumption precisely illustrates the hardship of people's lives. There are many poor people living in Shanghai. But from this fact, we can understand the extent of poverty among ordinary people. At least we can see that the lives of residents are more difficult this year than last year!</p>
<p>The situation is probably like this. It is originally difficult for ordinary families to cope with daily necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt. Meat is difficult to make a main food, but compared with vegetables, it is inevitably more extravagant. Therefore, when it is not easy for everyone to maintain their lives, they have to start by being thrifty, giving up meat and eating vegetarian food. Two dimes of pork is only enough for three or four people to eat a meal. Two hundred pennies of vegetables can barely last a day.</p>
<p>Another reason is that the prices of all goods in the market have been high for a year, which has increased the living standards of the people. According to the survey, various vegetables rose about twice as much last year as the year before. And meats such as pork, sheep, and cattle have also increased in price one after another. This has greatly affected the lives of residents. Many people can't even afford vegetables, let alone meat! This has caused the number of meat slaughters to drop sharply.</p>
<p>It is said that there was an emperor in the past who heard that there was a famine in the local area and that the people could not get food. The emperor felt sad and worried about it and asked the people around him, "Why don't the people eat meat?" From the perspective of the emperor who did not know the people's feelings, this question could not be more reasonable. It can be said that he had good plans, but when we hear it, it is like he is joking intentionally. It is too ridiculous! If the people had meat to eat, would they be afraid of starving?</p>
<p>But this is only limited to the poor, and the rich are not counted. A group of masters and young masters in Shanghai don't care about a big dish costing fifty yuan, let alone pork costing more than three pounds for one yuan? Maybe they don't even want to swallow this kind of thing.</p>
<p>Fortunately, according to health experts, vegetarian food is very beneficial to the body. Recently, a new theory of "meat is harmful" has also been invented in Germany(?). In this way, although the poor do not have the blessing of eating meat, it is good for their health. Then everyone doesn't have to sigh "not knowing the taste of meat" anymore!</p>
<p>Scientific Miscellany</p>
<h3>A Study Comparing the Intelligence of Cats and Dogs</h3>
<p>— Chao Xi</p>
<p>Are cats as intelligent as dogs? The answer obtained from empirical judgment is negative. Many scientific tests have also confirmed that dogs are more intelligent. However, science is not so credulous. The reason is that there has not been a fair study of cats, because dogs are social animals. They love their masters, make their masters happy, like to be praised, and have more opportunities to show their intelligence than cats. As for cats, their nature and habits are solitary. They are indifferent to their masters' attitudes and praises. Naturally, it is not easy to see their "intelligence."</p>
<p>Recently, the psychology laboratory of Columbia University is investigating the extent to which cats can be intelligent. The equipment used in the research is very ingenious, that is, the cat is locked in a cage and asked to open the door. The form of the problem is as follows: Can the cat open the door? If so, how many times will it try?</p>
<p>The method is as follows: three wooden round thin plates are placed on the floor, and they are connected with metal wires. Pulling one of them can make all of them move. Arranged in this way, if the animal can step on it according to the appropriate procedure, it can open the door of the food box. For example, if we arrange the boards, the hungry cat must first step on the first board, then the second board, and then the third board to get the milk in the box.</p>
<p>Dr. Hunt, a professor of psychology at Clark University, has done a different experiment. His purpose is to determine how much time an animal can focus on an action plan. The tool used in the experiment is a house with a population, with three food boxes in front of it. First, the animal is trained to let it know that when there is light at the opening of the box, it is the food box that can be opened. After the connection between food and light can be firmly established,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>, the real test begins.</p>
<p>In this experiment, the light is first emitted. The animal sees the light through the wire mesh and prepares to run to the front of the box to find food. But now the light is turned off, and the animal is prohibited from running away and told to wait for a moment. Then, after how much time can the animal still remember the shining box? According to the results of the experiment, cats can remember for 16 to 18 seconds, while dogs can remember for 1 minute to 2 minutes.</p>
<p>There are also many reliable and amazing stories about the intelligence of cats. Romanes, the secretary of zoology and naturalist of the Linnaeus Society of London, once said that there was a story that a cat, whose owner had the habit of throwing broken bread to birds, would hide in the trees and suddenly jump out to catch them when the birds were eating. Once, the bread was thrown out at dusk and covered with light snow. The next morning, the owner found that the cat had opened the snow, the bread had been moved to another place, and it had been placed on the snow, and then it was hiding in the woods, waiting for the birds to come.</p>
<p>There is another story that a cat's back was accidentally stained with kerosene, and then it got fire on its back because it approached the stove and sparks flew on it. It immediately ran out of the house and jumped into the water tank to put out the fire.</p>
<p>These examples, if we admit that they are reliable, show that not only do cats have the ability to observe, but also the ability to plan, showing high intelligence.</p>
<p>As for the story about dogs, Romanes once said that a dog hated taking a bath very much. Its resentment became deeper day by day. Later, as long as it saw a servant bringing water to bathe it, it became very violent. So the hostess wanted to try it herself. But she couldn't succeed. She couldn't succeed in coaxing it, threatening it, beating it, or starving it. Finally, the owner decided to use the "quiet coping method." She ignored it. When she went for a walk, she no longer took it out. When she sat down to read or sew clothes, the dog ran to her, and she turned her head away. After more than ten days like this. Finally, one morning, the dog came to her and showed an attitude of repentance, so she immediately gave it a bath, and it was very tolerant. It cried happily and jumped out the door for its daily walk. The second time it was bathed, it was very stubborn at first, but as soon as the owner turned her head away, it immediately jumped into the bathtub.</p>
<p>From the evidence of experiments and stories, it can be seen that dogs are more intelligent than cats. However, to make a fair comparison, the significant differences between dogs and cats should be studied, so we have to study their genetics. Dogs come from a social animal (wolves), while cats come from a solitary animal (wild cats, etc.). Therefore, in the case of dogs, we should think that they are fundamentally social animals. When they attack and defend, they are united, which lays the foundation for cooperation. On the contrary, cats are solitary, and their characteristics are self-sufficiency, ingenuity, and cunning.</p>
<p>Although many years have passed, old habits still exist. When dogs chase their prey, they bark loudly, but cats quietly and silently walk towards their goal. Also, dogs seem to be competing with other dogs when they call for food. They eat very quickly and don't chew carefully, but cats are careful eaters, often spending a lot of time playing with their prey before killing and eating it.</p>
<p>Because dogs have no instinct and history of loneliness, they are very painful when abandoned. As soon as it finds its owner, it will faithfully follow him, but cats are not the same. They are not in familiar places.</p>
<p>From this, we can also know why dogs are very obedient and have a sense of responsibility, because they are social animals. They know what is reasonable and unreasonable, so they are willing to rely on their owners even if they are punished for their mistakes, but cats cannot accept any punishment, otherwise they will run away.</p>
<p>In short, there is not much difference in intelligence between cats and dogs.</p>
<h3>代 Post</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng:</p>
<p>Since the supplement does not have a fixed length, the typesetting room often keeps five or six manuscripts to make up for the length when arranging the layout. Therefore, it is not surprising that a manuscript cannot be published within a few days, unless it is time-sensitive. I am afraid that this is a difficulty that Mr. "the editor you worked with" did not think of, right?</p>

<p>The weather is clear and the fragrance of grass is everywhere. No way to dispel sorrow but to stroll the streets. I am, by nature, a chivalrous soul, hard to subdue. Who would have thought I would marry that Yan Xijiao. I swallow my anger and try to comfort myself. Who cares about unexpected troubles? The intimate talks beside the pillow are strange and unusual. She is, like willow catkins, her nature hard to control. I must constantly, like searching for a snake in the grass, be on guard everywhere. Oh, how annoying! Oh, how annoying! Her unrestrained behavior does not invite envy. At this moment, her outward heart is revealed. Ah, Yan Xijiao, Yan Xijiao, I see that your constant arguing is not without cause. In the end, when the truth is revealed, how will you cope? My thoughts are in turmoil as I ponder. I encounter the procuress on the street. The fragrant quilt has been wasted until today. How can I comfort Yan Xijiao? She is, her eyes wet with tears, always thinking of you. She regrets it to this day, full of sorrow. You should know that marital discord is common. You should not have hardened your heart and run away elsewhere. It is truly a coincidence to meet here. I urge you to temporarily endure and return to the fragrant nest. My thoughts are muddled, and I am too lazy to lift my body. I am, suddenly hearing a shout, instantly stunned. One is, a thorn in my eye, resentment in my heart upon meeting. One is, in broad daylight, afraid that she won't come. But it is said that Lang is sitting downstairs. It makes one speechless and full of doubt. This act of infidelity will be punished. She must kneel in the courtyard and offer apologies. Perhaps then, I can appease Ping Nu's hatred.</p>

<p>He has put in a lot of effort, a serious attitude, and a tense emotion, and is about to complete the entire film.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it is not only full of thrilling scenes, but also has the magnificent assistance of the government army in the fierce battle between the army and bandits, with officers personally participating, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>The actors include the Gu Lanjun and Mei Jun sisters, Wang Zhengxin, Gong Jianong, Xie Yunqing, etc., who are all well-known stars in the film industry. Their skillful and profound acting skills have long been confirmed, and there is even more surprising progress in this film.</p>
<p>Audiences, this "Full of Life and Vigor" will give you a new feeling and a new excitement!</p>
<h3>"The General's Daughter" Premiered Last Night</h3>
<p>"The General's Daughter" premiered at the New Light Grand Theater last night at 9:15 PM.</p>
<p>This is a historical episode from the Dawn era. The story tells the tragedy of a warlord's madness, tyranny, and slaughter on the eve of his downfall. The general's daughter has a classmate (who is also her lover), but he is a revolutionary youth. Because of their different positions, separation is inevitable. However, she sympathizes with the revolution, opposes her father's atrocities, and although her father loves her very much, she finally betrays him and takes a pistol, killing her father with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Li Zhuozhuo's portrayal of the general's daughter is undoubtedly successful. Although Li Qing is a newcomer, he gives us a surprising discovery here. Han Langen's little soldier is really cute. The embarrassment when he was found naked in the bathtub by the officer is a burst of laughter.</p>
<p>Last night, when the film premiered, the New Light Grand Theater was already packed with audiences before 8:30 PM. Many people had to leave temporarily because it was full, which shows the audience's love for Lianhua films.</p>
<p>He Mengfu, the director of "The General's Daughter," has a deep understanding of film and drama. The film's outstanding achievements are certainly not without reason.</p>
<h3>Minxin News</h3>
<p>The "New Humanitarianism" location shooting team reports: They are still working in Qingjiangpu and have received the help of favorable weather, geography, and people, so the results are exceptionally satisfactory.</p>
<p>Jin Qingyu recently returned to Shanghai from Nanjing to manage company affairs. Because there are still unfinished matters in Beijing, he will go to Beijing again soon and will not be able to return to Shanghai to prepare for the start of "Siblings Quarrel" until two weeks later.</p>
<p>Li Keng's father, Li Minwei, recently went to Qingjiangpu to visit and take care of Li and Ms. Lin Chuchu, who are filming on location in Qingjiangpu, and to observe the filming.</p>
<p>Xiao Ying has been hired to play the role of Police Chief in Ren Pengnian's film "Mysterious Female Detective." This kind of solemn and upright character suits Xiao's personality. His excellent performance in "Gate of Flesh and Spirit" will add a lot of color to "Mysterious Female Detective."</p>
<p>Wu Lizhu's previous films were most famous in Southeast Asia, so she is known as the Queen of Southeast Asia. This time, her performance in "Mysterious Female Detective" is even more enjoyable. With the addition of strongman Peng Fei and tough guy star Wen Rong assisting in the performance, they will surely achieve extraordinary results to entertain the audience.</p>
<p>The story of "Little Gentleman," starring Lin Chuchu and Li Keng, is taken from "Little Lord Fauntleroy," but it will be adapted by Bu Wancang to make the plot even more moving.</p>
<h3>Model Children's Drama Society Expanding Recruitment of Members</h3>
<p>Children are the supporters of future society and the builders of the new world. They will continue our work and complete all the great achievements that our generation has not completed. Therefore, we should value children and pay more attention to children's education - because everything they receive in childhood is more intense and lasting, and "education" is easier than "re-education."</p>
<p>Drama is a new tool for creating new children and the most powerful weapon for educating children. The members of the "Model Children's Monthly" have realized this, so they have launched a "Model Children's Drama Society." Now the preparations are complete, and it has been decided to hold a formal founding meeting on March 28. The entertainment program will include two one-act children's plays, "The Thief" and "A Glimpse of Jia Bei."</p>
<p>In order to provide responsible guidance to children who are interested in drama, the society has hired Hong Shen, Xu Xingzhi, Zhang Min, Song Zhi, Chen Liting, Cui Wanqiu, Xu Huaisha, Li Yi, Mo Si, Lu Si, etc. as consultants. It is heard that the society plans to make large-scale school tours. Because it feels that there are not enough talents, it is openly recruiting members once. All children (whether they are students or store apprentices) and elementary school teachers who are interested in drama are sincerely welcome to participate. Those interested, please register with Mr. Zhou at 27 Yuqingfang, North Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Fools Have Their Own Fool's Luck; Stupid People Actually Win the Aviation Lottery</h3>
<p>Ge Furong and Weng Shirong, a heaven-made pair of fools in Tianyi Company, are both dull and foolish, full of stupidity. Their lives are very poor, and they have no extra money to buy aviation lottery tickets, but when luck comes, gold will really fall from the sky. A few days ago, it was the day when the aviation lottery was drawn. When they were wandering on the road, they suddenly picked up an aviation lottery ticket. They collected it, and later went to the store that sold lottery tickets to take a look, and actually won the first prize, 250,000 yuan, gained without labor, a thunderbolt from the blue, the poor boy actually became a rich man. Therefore, "wealth and glory" made his companions envious, and they all said that "fools have their own fool's luck."</p>

<h3>Tibetan Banquet</h3>
<p>The Jiamuyang Living Buddha of Labrang Monastery entertains the envoys escorting the Panchen Lama with a Tibetan-style banquet. Guests all sit cross-legged, with seats set up on both sides. The dishes are only beef, mutton, and butter tea rice.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<h3>Livestock Improvement Farm</h3>
<p>The farm was established by the Economic Commission near Ganping Temple, only a few dozen miles from Labrang. It is under construction with a budget of 300,000 yuan. Its purpose is to improve the breeds of cattle and sheep in the northwestern Tibetan areas.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<h3>Tibetan Primary School</h3>
<p>In order to improve the knowledge of the Tibetan people, Huang Zhengqing, the security commander, founded the Tibetan People's Cultural Promotion Association and established a Tibetan primary school. After several years of operation, there are now more than 60 students, with Chinese as the main subject.</p>

<h3>Gospel Hall</h3>
<p>There are two Jesus churches in Labrang, with foreign missionaries stationed here to preach. The missionaries are very knowledgeable about Tibetan customs and can speak fluent Tibetan, but there are still not many Tibetans who believe in Christianity. There are only three believers in this mission.</p>

<p>Group Rice Harvesting</p>
<p>The Agricultural College of Anhui University has contracted 100,000 acres of official wasteland in Xihu, Huoqiu County, built embankments for rice cultivation, and achieved significant results. During the rice harvesting season last year, the water was three or four feet deep, but fortunately, the rice was five or six feet tall, so it was not harmed. The Agricultural College of Anhui University recruited more than 2,000 farmers and workers, 100 sailboats, and organized a rice harvesting team, with three district teams and fifty-four combined teams. Dean Feng Zigang of the college and all the teachers and students of the first-year agronomy department personally supervised the work, organizing daily groups for harvesting, transportation, and threshing, and holding work competitions. Those with excellent results could receive bonuses in addition to their due remuneration, and the order was excellent. The following pictures show some aspects of the work.</p>

<h3>Listening to Instructions</h3>
<p>Before starting work in the morning, farmers and workers listen to instructions in the square in front of the Huoqiu office of the Agricultural College of Anhui University.</p>
