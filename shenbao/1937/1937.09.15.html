<h3>我新陣地縣亘五十公里敵各路進犯均遭擊退</h3>
<p>昨夜閘北有激戰敵不支潰退　永安橋我軍大刀隊肉博殺敵　敵軍一再覬覦浦東形勢吃緊</p>
<p>我軍自退守第一道防綫後、除沿綫派駐重兵外、有若干處猶在防綫之前、設置警戒綫，與敵相持、現我軍之新陣地、自北站至八字橋·江灣·大塲·劉行、以迄羅店·瀏河、實卽一二八戰事發生時之原來陣地、但目前我軍警戒綫、仍在羅店與月浦間之新鎮起、經永安橋、（楊行與劉行之間）以迄廟行、復（攝行輿劉行之問）以迄廟行、復由第－公墓越三民路西首至臨近江灣跑馬廳之八字橋宅·澄衷醫院　折至黃興路、以達東區租界甯國路之接壤處、全綫共長五十公里、工事堅強、足資固守、據昨夜所得報告、各綫敵軍、均有進犯企圖、致發生接觸、尤以閘北－帶、敵軍自發迄晚，不斷進擾、機槍與步槍聲時時可聞、至午夜十二時至今晨二時許、接戰尤烈、惟我軍沈着應戰、予敵痛擊、敵軍毫無寸進、</p>
<p>我軍為脫離敵艦砲火之威脅及避免無謂之犧牲計，乃於前晨（十三）將市中心區及引翔鄉－帶之陣地後撤、退守第一道防綫、我軍由市中心區一帶後撤之部隊、據淞滬路以東、扼守由高境廟至萬國體育會之綫、敵軍之部隊，則侵抵由陸家角（在市運動場之西）至泗涇球塲（在殷高路楊家宅附近）之綫、自前日午夜起，數度向我進犯，我軍沉着應戰、俟敵逼近，卽以機關槍密集掃射，並以手溜彈向敵襲擊、迄昨午止、敵未得逞、至於我軍由引翔鄉一帶後撤之部隊、扼守於黃興路之綫、右翼仍踞租界北部之綫、絕無變動、引翔鄉東部之敵、前晚向我黃興路之綫進犯、我軍冒雨迎擊、來福槍及機關槍之聲、澈夜不絕、直至昨晨拂曉、敵受重創、不支而退、</p>
<p>中央社南京十四日電、軍息、十三日由楊行沿公路兩側進犯劉行之敵、於十三日夜全被擊退、十四日全綫無變化、</p>
<h3>楊行敵軍進犯永安橋發生激戰</h3>
<p>我軍揮動大刀殲敵無數　肉搏十餘次敵不支潰退　新鎮方面仍為我軍駐守</p>
<p>據官方消息、自月浦至羅店中段之新鎮、仍在我軍之手、前夜（十三日）敵軍自江邊向該鎮猛力進攻、江面敵艦同時亦開砲轟擊、我軍浴血抵抗，用機關槍小鋼砲射擊、雙方接戰猛烈、敵軍卒不支而退、</p>
<p>在新鎮南面之永安橘、前日（十三日）亦有猛烈之砲火，該地在劉行東面四千米突、卽楊行與劉行之中心點、敵軍當時分兩路推進、一路進攻橋北代家宅·新開河一帶，一路進攻橋南之北楊宅·蘊藻浜一帶，但我軍在該地早已築有堅固之防御工事、及敵軍逼近時、我士兵奮勇當先、躍出戰壕、以大刀與敵軍作肉搏戰、有十餘次之多、殲敵無數、現我軍仍固守原有陣綫、</p>
<p>中央社云、楊行方面、我軍移西二千公尺至一小河之北岸一帶、該處以永安橋溝通兩岸、現巳築就鞏固之工事、敵軍於十二日進至楊行鎮時、被我截擊多次、損傷奇重、故經增援補充後、始於前夜向前推進、我方得主力軍之補充、實力雄厚、正伺機反攻、旋敵蜂湧而來、我卽迎頭截擊、以機關槍手溜彈向敵陣擲擊、敵遭重大打擊、卽向左右分兵、我亦紛紛出壕應戰、當時戰綫延長至四千公尺、敵我雙方、各出死力相撲、白刃既接、我軍揮舞大刀、橫縱敵陣、所向披靡、如是者進退十餘次、至昨晨微明、敵始不支潰退，我仍固守原有陣地、此役敵取攻勢、故受創較重云、</p>
<h3>我軍砲轟敵司令部</h3>
<p>市中心區我軍因戰略關係、據守新陣綫、惟北站至八字橋之綫、屹然未動、以與愛國女學我軍成犄角之勢、嚴密監視海軍陸戰隊司令部之敵軍、昨日自晨至午、青雲路八字橋一帶我軍、向北四川路方面猛烈砲轟、同時機關槍聲，亦密如連珠，日本海軍陸戰隊司令部及北四川路日本小學附近、被我砲隊擊中二十餘彈、敵受創殊重、另數彈落於敵司令部之南約四百碼處、</p>
<h3>翔殷路昨晨有激戰</h3>
<p>敵軍雖進據引翔鄉及市中心區，但引翔鄉方面我軍、現仍退守甯國路西黃興路－帶、前晚六時許、至昨晨拂曉、該處有步槍及機關槍激戰、昨晨浦江敵艦偶行開砲、其目的亦在該處我軍陣地，以助其步兵之進攻、但我軍戮力抵抗、誓死不退、敵軍頗受傷亡、卒未得逞、</p>
<p>敵軍進至市中心區後、昨晨以鐵甲車及坦克車二十三輛、配以步兵及騎兵各約三百人、沿淞滬公路、向南進犯、企圖威脅我特區北部引翔區之駐軍、我軍自軍工路一帶後撤、步步為營、在黃興路一帶、已有強力據點、當時我卽沿黃興路迎擊、發生遭遇戰而阻其南下、我軍奮勇抗戰、有進無退、敵受重大打擊，卽憑翔殷路與我相持中、</p>
<h3>浦東形勢突見緊張</h3>
<p>日來浦東形勢、突然緊張、敵謀登陸之企圖、已由消極而轉為積極、昨晨六時起以迄午刻、停泊於浦江中之敵艦、又斷續向我浦東方面砲擊，擬藉以掩護登陸、惟以我軍戒備嚴密、未有動作、至午後四時許、敵軍第六號驅逐艦一艘、由楊樹浦方面開來、至白渡橋之陸家嘴江心拋錨、其艦首正對春江碼頭、同時有日方小兵駁一艘、似早在該處守候者、裝載敵軍三十餘人、疾向着江码头驶去、意在試探上陸、正欲停靠上陸、我守軍已早瞭見、待其停駁欲上之際、始用機關槍掃射、當塲有日兵多名受伤、而拋在碼頭外江心之六號日驱逐舰、本載有大隊兵士、擬卽掩護登岸者、至是以開砲無效力、急以重機關槍、對碼頭上我軍亂放、一時槍彈四飛、火花亂射、外灘之往來行人、紛紛逃避、在各碼頭之小工、亦各相率停止工作、暫避流彈、約半小時始止、白兵駁卽於斯時、逃離春江碼頭、而向下游駛去、其六號驅逐艦見我有準備、亦起錨向東開駛、直到公和祥碼頭前、緊接出雲艦之東、就三號河筒上拋泊、迨至傍晚、敵艦又向我浦東方面炮擊、我言立卽以重砲還擊、互轟約半小時始止、嗣於晚間七時許、敵軍在日本總領署附近、以機槍隔江掃射、然亦聊以洩憤、徒耗子彈而已、同時尚有氣艇三數艘、滿載敵軍、游弋於外灘公園一帶浦面、似又有向浦東登陸企圖、惟我戒備嚴密、敵如來犯、决予重創云、</p>
<h3>敵轟炸浦東酒精廠</h3>
<p>敵機於前日下午一時半至三時半、曾三次結集一小隊、飛至浦東白蓮涇轟炸酒精廠、前后曾投十三彈、而多數落在田野內、該酒精廠雖略受損壞、然附近民房毀者則甚多、昨晨渡浦調查、當塲傷者二十餘人、死者五人、均為隣近之鄉民，查酒精廠早已停工，而其屋頂懸有英國旗、同時附近有美商大來輪船公司及英商綸昌染織廠，該處－帶工廠多外僑之財產、而日機不惜轟炸、足證不顧公法、昨晨九時許、又有敵機一架、在南市循日暉港一帶低飛偵察、間以斷續之機槍掃射、未幾又向浦東飛去、</p>
<p>敵機昨仍四出活動、於五時許、曾在浦東投彈、企圖炸毀我砲兵陣地、以解除楊樹浦方面敵軍之威脅、惟據浦東方面駐軍之報告、敵方投彈、漫無目標、故我陣地、並無損失、</p>
<p>敵機每日在南市浦東一帶後方騷擾、民眾受害非淺、昨日上午、敵機又飛往南市偵察、見行人則以機槍掃射、至下午三時至四時、復有敵機兩架、在浦東南黃浦一帶偵察、並掃射、旋又飛至南市城廂一帶、以機槍向下掃射、城內居民、本視城中心為安樂士、今則一日三驚、而敵方憤以屠殺平民為其唯一之本領、是以昨日起、紛紛逃難、居留者僅十之一二、</p>
<p>昨日上午十時許、及下午二時左右、敵機三架、在滬西中山路及極司非路浜北一帶、盤旋偵察、並以機槍掃射、傷一老嫗、大塲附近、亦被敵機投彈兩枚、損害甚微、又上午十一時至正午間、敵機飛往閘北轟炸、柳營路閘北電力分公司被炸燬、</p>
<h3>敵又到援軍二千餘人</h3>
<p>昨日下午、續有敵巡洋艦竹若號一艘駛滬、停靠招商局中棧、尚有敵軍二千餘人登陸、增援虹口方面之敵軍、</p>
<p>據楊樹浦方面來人談、昨日上午六時起、楊樹浦及虹口區一帶日軍運輸卡車、卽滿載武裝日軍及輸重軍需品等、往來奔馳、紛紛向虹口公園及引翔鄉等地而去、甚形忙碌、視此敵軍對該方面之軍事、似又加以從新佈置也、</p>
<p>昨晨拂曉時、有敵軍運輸輪一艘抵滬、停泊黃浦路三菱碼頭、運下大批麻布袋及防禦材料、聞該輪卽於當晚、裝載敵軍傷亡屍體駛回日本、</p>
<h3>敵又運到軍火兩船</h3>
<p>前日駛滬敵商輪改建之運輸艦天津丸·大隆丸·鳥取丸、衣笠丸、及東泰丸等五艘、除後二艘將軍火卸竣後、業於昨日駛出外、餘一艘截至昨日下午、各貨尚未起卸完竣、而昨日上午七時一刻、下午一時半、復續有敵商輪改造之運輸艦一六六號雲海丸、及八九號貝發丸、共二艘駛滬、分靠黃浦及招商局兆棧碼頭、除有大量重兵器、如鐵甲車·裝甲汽車·坦克車·等卸下外、並有大批黑色大號汽車及汽油千餘筒、起運登陸、現各碼頭棧房之堆放敵軍火及軍需品、以大阪及黃浦二碼頭為最多、但其重要物品、則皆堆放於招商局中棧及北棧棧房云、</p>
<h3>沿浦一帶敵軍概况</h3>
<p>自我軍為戰略關係、於前日起、退守第一道防綫後、記者為欲明瞭沿浦各敵軍狀况計、特於昨日上午八時起、卽親赴浦面觀察、茲將所覩、彙誌如下、記者於昨晨在外灘登輪出發、當輪駛過陸家嘴後、看見停靠招商局中棧·北棧·大阪·及黃浦諸碼頭之敵商輪改建之運輸艦五艘、起卸軍火、甚為忙碌、輪漸外駛、見楊樹浦路底蘭路附近火燒甚烈、再前、見市中心區有三處大火、燃燒之烈、前所罕有、市區各項重要建築物、恐已付－炬矣、自來水廠附近、有敵軍戰馬二十餘匹、拖運野戰砲及重砲等多門、另由卡車三輛、載敵軍八九十人隨後、徐向軍工路市中心區駛去、軍工路並停有鐵甲車一輛、軍工路橋則已被炸斷、再前至張華浜、見該處停有敵卡車十餘輛、戰馬三百餘匹、陸軍三百餘人、至蕰藻浜有敵陸軍五百餘人、戰馬一百餘匹、及至吳淞鎮、在該處海關分關附近、有敵拖砲用馬車四輛、吳淞鎮並有敵陸軍二百餘人、吳淞口海關分關一帶、停有卡車百餘輛、大約當又有大批敵援軍開到、該項卡車、卽為準備敵軍登陸後載赴前方應用者、總計自虬江碼頭起至吳淞口止、搭有草棚甚多、散處江邊之零星敵軍、卽以此項草棚為起息之所、以上卽為記者昨日視察沿浦所得情形之梗概也、</p>
<h3>昨日敵艦移泊調查</h3>
<p>駛滬之各敵艦、據記者昨日下午四時赴江而調查結果、其集結之大本營可分為四、卽㊀吳淞口、㊁瀏河、㊂虬江碼頭、㊃浦內、吳淞口一帶停泊之敵艦共為四十九艘、虬江碼頭附近共廿六艘、浦江內共廿一艘、以上總計為九十六艘、由此估計停泊瀏河一帶敵艦、當在四十艘左右也、茲將淞口及虬江碼頭一帶及浦內敵艦停泊情形、調查如下、（甲）吳淞口一帶、計淞口外巡洋艦五艘、運輸艦十五艘、砲艦五艘、驅逐艦二艘、吳淞口至獅子林一帶十一艘、吳淞口海關分關驅逐艦一艘、吳淞鎮第一三五·二七三·一八五·二一九·二○九·八三號等運輸艦九艘、（餘三艘名號不明）、同濟大學附近浦面砲艦一艘、以上共四十九艘（乙）虬江碼頭一帶、計軍工路自來水廠砲艦廿一號廿三號各一艘、高橋對面砲艦一艘、虬江碼頭對面廿三號敵艦二艘、虬江碼頭敵艦十六艘、虬江碼頭南首對面巡洋艦一艘、廿一號驅逐艦一艘、廿一號砲艦一艘、魚市場對面廿三號驅逐艦一艘、電燈廠六號巡洋艦一艘（已在向外開出）、以上共為廿六艘、（丙）浦內、四十一號·卅六號·廿二號·十六號·十五號·十四號·十一號浮筒砲艦各一艘、九號·八號·七號·六號·五號·一號·浮筒驅逐艦各一艘、二號浮筒出雲旗艦一艘、三菱碼頭十一號驅逐艦一艘、招商中棧巡洋艦一艘、招商北棧敵商輪改運輸艦二艘、大阪碼頭運輸艦一艘、黃浦碼頭運輸艦二艘、以上為廿一艘、總計自吳淞口外獅子林起至浦內止、共泊有敵艦九十六艘云、</p>
<h3>我軍在滬後退英各方均表同情</h3>
<p>欽佩我士兵之英勇抗戰</p>
<p>中央社倫敦十四日路透電、中國軍隊、自上海區後退、各方聞之均表示同情、並對於中國軍隊“五星期以來、血肉與日軍之鋼鐵英勇抗戰、皆一致表示欽佩、”再則英倫各報、對於中國方面之新聞、均以顯著之地位、加以披露、可見一般民眾關切之意、而各報特派記者之報告、復繪聲繪色、尤使讀者對於中國軍人之勇武、增加崇敬之心、報紙之中、尤以每日導報為最出人頭地、因該報每日刊載蔣委員長夫人之電訊、此種戰爭報告、以其為新聞記載之優良模楷、且富有新聞價值、故已引起倫敦報紙區域一致之讚美、此間軍事觀察家、極稱中國軍隊後退之合乎理智、而以日軍之再蹈一二八之覆轍為異、因五年以前、日軍侵入亳無軍事價值之地、得不償失、而今日竟再犯其錯誤也、再則可明白指陳者、卽在美國政策為隔離派和平份子所控制之時、列強俱無起而干涉之表示是也、官塲方面之意見、覺目前一時尚難揣測事變之結局、及日本目的物之真實內容、此則或者東京方面、亦無明晰之概觀、惟普通一般人之觀察、認華北為日本主要意向之所在、亦卽日本目的之焦點云、盂却斯德指導報稱、中日戰爭、兩閱月之後、現已可作一結論、卽日本主要努力、將在華北而不在上海、無論日本是否能使中國屈膝、終難忘與蘇聯開戰之可能性、因此日本所切望者、卽在中國蘇聯間插入一楔形物、而在中國之西北、建立防禦陣綫云、</p>
<p>該報謂日軍已在華北獲有大勝利、此為不可否認之事實、但日軍尚未擊敗中國之主力軍、且須應付著名之紅軍、紅軍現正準備困擾日軍、加以日軍所佔之土地、尚須防禦游擊軍、以保其安全、游擊軍已在“滿洲國”證明其為可畏之敵矣、晨郵報載、有近由華北歸來之特別訪員所著之社論、謂日軍作戰之範圍甚廣、交通綫甚長、時時有為敵人破壞之虞、平原與山地之狀况、皆予華軍作游擊戰之極大便利、華軍擅長此種戰術、華軍雖不能逐出日軍、但力能予以困擾、而消耗其戰鬬力、真正之决戰、將在冬季數月中、屆時日軍在各路陣綫者、大約將有三十五萬之眾、維持此種大軍於外國戰區之幅員大如歐洲、且日軍不能耐寒、此皆於日軍不利者也、中國在軍火方面支持之能力、現在各方均認為係局勢之重要關鍵、因之中國報紙所要求之正式實戰、甚難獲到贊助、因宣戰之後、中國極少明顯之利益、且將自動的使日本有檢查船隻之權、以目前而論、則日本似乎在證實國籍之外、當不願對於外國航運有所干涉也、</p>
<h3>敵軍進至泗涇球塲</h3>

<h3>持久作戰之兩個原則</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>前昨兩日。我軍在楊行與江灣市中心的兩個陣地。略有修正。這兩處陣地在目前我們主要的戰綫上。原是處於凸出的部分。與敵人的衝擊。至為猛烈。而消耗也較為巨大。但這種消耗並非絕對必需的。故我軍於第一道防綫完全修築鞏固後。卽將這兩處的前哨軍隊各退五公里。把凸出的部分除去。而使自瀏河經羅店。劉行。大場。江灣。至八字橋的主要防綫。成爲一直綫。這個修正陣地的移動。非常鎭定而有秩序。敵人懾於一月來我軍英勇抗戰的餘威。又顧忌我軍所埋伏的地雷。未敢輕率前進。我軍於調集新防綫之後。也立卽守定陣地。使敵人的冒險進襲。受到猛烈的挫擊。</p>
<p>這次修正陣綫的佈置。在許多外國軍事專家的目光中。都認的冒險進襲。受到猛烈的挫擊。這次修正陣綫的佈置在許多外國軍事專家的目光中，都認為非常適當。而於我絕無損失。但是敵人及其所利用的漢奸則已趁此機會。散佈謠言。使一部分缺乏軍事常識的人。受到欺騙。這種情形。在我們進行抗戰的期間。是應當嚴切注意。加以防範的。所以在這裹。我們應將持久作戰的兩個最基本的原則。略加說明。使一般人對於最近我們戰略上措置的意義。能有更淸楚的認識。</p>
<p>目前我們對於日帝國主義的抗戰。為一種持久的戰爭。我們不怕陣綫的擴展。我們不怕敵軍的增多。其基本的理由。卽因為戰綫愈分散。敵人的消耗愈大。對於我們的持久作戰。也愈是有利。在這樣持久作戰的計劃之下。我們已抱定着兩個原則。卽第一。一二處陣地的得失。在我们整個抗戰的計劃中。是並不關係重要的。因為我們將永久繼續抗戰下去。一直抗戰到敵人精疲力盡。從我們土地上掃蕩出去而後已。第二。我們雖然不過於看重一二處陣地的得失。但是敵人要取得我們一尺一寸的陣地。我們仍必須使敵人付下最大的代價。</p>
<p>上述這兩個原則。在月餘以來淞滬的抗戰中已有了充分的證明。敵人三次增援。動員六師團。集中軍艦百餘艘。至今却祇能爭得我們江岸上十餘公里的一帶土地。敵人的攻入寶山。損失軍隊在兩團以上。前日敵軍由虬江碼頭衝入市中心。又觸中我軍的地雷。週餘以來。敵人為奪取軍工路。達到楊樹浦與吳淞之間的連絡。不知已付下多大的犧犧。到現在敵人在淞滬所遭遇的損失。至少在二萬人以上。而砲彈及其他軍火的消耗。則已成為不可勝計的鉅大數額。在這種情形之下。足證我們的持久抗戰。已收得了很大的成功。</p>
<p>在江岸上作戰。敵人的軍艦大砲。尚可亂逞其盲目轟擊的威風。而在我們的戰線移向內地之後。海軍已無用武之地。在陸戰中間我軍以堅固的陣地。以英勇的戰士。將使敵人的盲衝亂撞。處處受到最猛烈的回擊。我們可以確信。在這樣持久作戰的情勢下。“泥足”的日本帝國主義。最後必將葬身於它自己的侵略政策的墳墓中。</p>

<p>此項條約除由英法士俄等九國簽字、并聽任意國簽字加入、</p>
<h3>各國代表發表演說</h3>
<p>簽字畢後、法外長台爾博斯發表演說、指出尼翁鎭恊定之重要、謂此項恊定足以解决地中海海盜問題、“抑此次地中海會議、各國代表、均抱良善意志、因而得以迅速成立恊定、從茲地中海上、生命賴以保護、航業安全賴以保障、而國際道德、亦賴以維持、此予敢為出席各國代表深致慶賀者也、至於潛水艇以外、其他各種侵略方式、亦不應加以忽視、容當在本屆國聯會大會加以討論、同時在尼翁鎮會議所建議之各項有效措置、則應立卽加以實施”、台爾博斯復稱、意國原被邀請參加會議、此後希望其接受共同合作、結論則謂、“地中海會議之結果、足以瞪明集體安全原則之具有實效、且足為國際連帶一致之模範”云、</p>
<p>繼由蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫致辭、略稱、蘇聯代表團對於地中海會議、迅速成立恊定、深為滿意、惟保護地中海上船舶、並未將西班牙共和政府所屬船舶包含在內、殊為可惜耳、繼稱、尼翁鎮恊定、乃係集體安全與區域恊定理想之實現、凡參加尼翁鎭會議之各國、均屬於和平陣綫云、南斯拉夫代表亦發表演說、對於恊定簽字表示慶賀、最後由英國外相艾登致辭、以台爾博斯在此次會議中、任指導之職、特向其致賀、並向參加會議各國代表道謝、謂各國代表此項工作極有裨益、希望此項恊定、獲得全世界之贊成、而關係各國、亦均能加以核准、至午後一時零五分、地中海會議宣吿閉幕、各國代表均乘汽車返日內瓦（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［日內瓦］意國方面今日聲稱、意相墨索里尼已接受尼翁恊定、惟有“某項保留”、據悉墨氏對於恊定之一般規定、業已同意、所謂“保留”、大概為意國巡弋地中海之範圍、墨氏嫌其過小、不甚滿意、法國方面表示、意國欲與英法處於平等地位、惟英國觀察者則稱、墨氏僅欲稍為擴大意國巡弋之範圍云（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］據此間消息靈通方面宣稱、意國當局對於尼翁恊定、極表反感、負責人士亦謂、英法兩國海軍員監察地中海全部之責、而對於意國則僅畀予次要地位、而令其監察地中海之一部分、卽其所指定之區城（自熱那亞港至撒丁島）亦非意國所能接受、又地中海會議所成立之恊定發表在先、而通知意國在後、此層亦足使意國感覺不快、意政府現正與德國當局交換意見、並當與英政府進行談話、然後採取最後决定、此外意政界人士對於德国並不參加地中海監察辦法一層、鮮加評論、但以為蘇聯之不參加地中海監察乃係理所當然云、（中央社十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>據聞日本國會。公推代表十二人。於前日來滬。慰勞前敵侵略將士。並聞除慰勞外。還附帶調查戰事實在情况之使命。此固代表八千數百萬民眾。而憂心國是者所應有之表示也。我聞日本國內報紙宣傳。謂一面已進展至某某州。一面已進展至某某城。現在諸君親歷其境。縱觀戰跡。而僅以我軍方始自動撤退之市中心區。為誇耀無上之偉績者。當亦不免深感絕大之失望矣。倘諸君得有餘暇。當由我國竭誠招待。請至先施公司。南車站。松江車站。與北新涇。等處一遊。一觀貴國將士們英勇之奇跡也。諸君此次返國。想必有深刻而榮譽之印像。忠實報告於國人。</p>

<h3>Our New Front Extends Fifty Kilometers; Enemy Advances from All Directions Repelled</h3>
<p>Heavy Fighting in Zhabei Last Night, Enemy Suffered a Crushing Defeat and Retreat; Yong'an Bridge: Our Army's Broadsword Squad Engaged the Enemy in Close Combat; Enemy Forces Repeatedly Coveting Pudong, Situation Tense</p>
<p>After our army retreated to the first line of defense, in addition to deploying heavy troops along the line, there were still several points in front of the line of defense, setting up a line of vigilance, confronting the enemy. Our army's current new front, from North Station to Baziqiao, Jiangwan, Dachang, Liuhang, and then to Luodian, Liuhuo, is actually the original front when the January 28th Incident occurred. However, at present, our army's line of vigilance still starts from Xinzhen between Luodian and Yuepu, passes through Yong'an Bridge (between Yanghang and Liuhang), and extends to Miaohang, then from the First Public Cemetery, crosses the west end of Sanmin Road to Baziqiao House and Chengzhong Hospital near the Jiangwan Racecourse, and turns to Huangxing Road to reach the border of Ningguo Road in the eastern concession. The entire line is fifty kilometers long, with strong fortifications, sufficient for defense. According to the report received last night, enemy troops on all lines had intentions to advance, resulting in contact, especially in the Zhabei area. Enemy troops constantly harassed from the beginning to the end of the night. The sound of machine guns and rifles could be heard from time to time. The fighting was particularly fierce from 12:00 midnight to around 2:00 AM this morning. However, our army responded calmly and dealt the enemy a heavy blow. The enemy made no progress.</p>
<p>In order to avoid the threat of enemy naval gun fire and to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, our army withdrew the positions in the city center and the Yinxiang Township area the day before yesterday (13th) and retreated to the first line of defense. The troops of our army that withdrew from the city center area are stationed east of Songhu Road, guarding the line from Gaojingmiao to the International Recreation Ground. The enemy troops then invaded the line from Lujiajiao (west of the City Sports Field) to Sijing Ball Field (near Yangjiazhai on Yingaolu Road). Since midnight the day before yesterday, they have repeatedly advanced on us. Our army responded calmly, waiting for the enemy to approach, then using machine guns to densely sweep, and using hand grenades to attack the enemy. As of yesterday afternoon, the enemy had not succeeded. As for the troops of our army that withdrew from the Yinxiang Township area, they are stationed on the Huangxing Road line, and the right wing still occupies the northern line of the concession, with no changes. The enemy in the eastern part of Yinxiang Township attacked our Huangxing Road line the night before last. Our army braved the rain to meet the attack. The sound of rifles and machine guns was incessant all night until dawn yesterday morning, when the enemy suffered heavy losses and retreated.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th: Military news: The enemy who attacked Liuhang along both sides of the highway from Yanghang on the 13th was completely repelled on the night of the 13th. There were no changes on the entire line on the 14th.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Erupted at Yong'an Bridge as Enemy Troops Advanced on Yanghang</h3>
<p>Our Army Wielded Broadswords, Annihilating Countless Enemies; More Than a Dozen Hand-to-Hand Combats, Enemy Suffered a Crushing Defeat and Retreat; Xinzhen Area Still Garrisoned by Our Army</p>
<p>According to official sources, Xinzhen, in the middle section from Yuepu to Luodian, is still in the hands of our army. The night before last (13th), enemy troops launched a fierce attack on the town from the riverbank. Enemy ships on the river also shelled it at the same time. Our army resisted heroically, using machine guns and small steel cannons to shoot. The two sides engaged in fierce combat. The enemy troops finally suffered a crushing defeat and retreated.</p>
<p>Yong'an Bridge, south of Xinzhen, was also subjected to fierce artillery fire the day before yesterday (13th). The place is four kilometers east of Liuhang, that is, the center point of Yanghang and Liuhang. The enemy troops advanced in two routes at that time, one route attacking the Dajiadian and Xinkaihe area north of the bridge, and the other route attacking the Beiyangzhai and Yunzaobang area south of the bridge. However, our army had already built solid defensive works in the area. When the enemy troops approached, our soldiers bravely took the lead, jumped out of the trenches, and engaged the enemy troops in hand-to-hand combat with broadswords, more than a dozen times, annihilating countless enemies. At present, our army is still firmly defending the original line of defense.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reported that in the Yanghang area, our army moved 2,000 meters west to the north bank of a small river. The Yong'an Bridge connects the two banks. Solid fortifications have now been built. When the enemy troops advanced to Yanghang Town on the 12th, they were intercepted by us many times and suffered heavy damage. Therefore, after reinforcements were added, they began to advance the night before last. Our side received the replenishment of the main force, with strong strength, and was waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Then the enemy swarmed in, and we immediately intercepted them head-on, throwing machine guns and hand grenades at the enemy陣. The enemy suffered a major blow and immediately divided their troops to the left and right. We also came out of the trenches to respond. At that time, the battle line extended to 4,000 meters. The enemy and our side each exerted their utmost strength to fight each other. When the blades met, our army waved broadswords, horizontally and vertically through the enemy陣, invincible. After advancing and retreating more than a dozen times like this, until the first light of dawn yesterday morning, the enemy finally suffered a crushing defeat and retreated, and we are still firmly defending our original position. In this battle, the enemy took the offensive, so they suffered more casualties.</p>
<h3>Our Army Bombed Enemy Headquarters</h3>
<p>Our army in the city center area, due to strategic considerations, is stationed on a new line of defense, but the line from North Station to Baziqiao remains unshaken, forming a mutually supportive posture with the Patriotic Girls' School, closely monitoring the enemy troops at the Naval Landing Force Headquarters. Yesterday, from morning to noon, our army in the Qingyun Road Baziqiao area fiercely bombarded the Beisichuan Road area. At the same time, the sound of machine guns was as dense as a string of pearls. The Japanese Naval Landing Force Headquarters and the area near the Japanese Elementary School on Beisichuan Road were hit by more than twenty rounds of our artillery, and the enemy suffered heavy damage. Several other rounds landed about 400 yards south of the enemy headquarters.</p>
<h3>Heavy Fighting on Xiangyin Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Although the enemy troops have advanced to Yinxiang Township and the city center area, our army in the Yinxiang Township area is now retreating to the area west of Ningguo Road, Huangxing Road. From about 6:00 PM the night before last to dawn yesterday morning, there was fierce rifle and machine gun fighting there. Yesterday morning, enemy ships in the Huangpu River occasionally fired their guns, the purpose of which was also to target the positions of our army in the area, in order to assist their infantry's attack. However, our army worked hard to resist and vowed not to retreat. The enemy troops suffered quite a few casualties, but they did not succeed in the end.</p>
<p>After the enemy troops advanced to the city center area, yesterday morning they used twenty-three armored vehicles and tanks, accompanied by about 300 infantry and cavalry each, to advance south along the Songhu Highway, attempting to threaten the garrison in the Yinxiang District in the northern part of our special zone. Our army withdrew from the Jungong Road area, step by step, operating in an orderly manner. In the Huangxing Road area, there were already strong strongholds. At that time, we immediately met the attack along Huangxing Road, and a battle was encountered to prevent them from going south. Our army fought bravely, advancing without retreating. The enemy suffered a major blow and then confronted us by relying on Xiangyin Road.</p>
<h3>Situation Suddenly Tense in Pudong</h3>
<p>In recent days, the situation in Pudong has suddenly become tense. The enemy's intention to land has changed from passive to active. From 6:00 AM to noon yesterday, enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River continued to shell our Pudong area intermittently, intending to cover the landing. However, because our army was closely guarded, there was no action. At about 4:00 PM, enemy Destroyer No. 6 sailed from Yangshupu to the Lujiazui river center of the Waibaidu Bridge and dropped anchor, with its bow facing the Chunjiang Wharf. At the same time, a Japanese small landing craft, which seemed to have been waiting there for a long time, carrying more than thirty enemy troops, quickly sailed towards the Jiang Wharf, intending to try to land. Just as it was about to dock and land, our garrison had already seen it and began to sweep with machine guns when it was about to stop. Many Japanese soldiers were injured on the spot. The No. 6 Japanese destroyer, anchored outside the wharf, was originally carrying a large number of soldiers who intended to cover the landing, but it was ineffective in opening fire, and hurriedly used heavy machine guns to fire randomly at our army on the wharf. For a time, bullets flew, and sparks shot around. The pedestrians on the Bund fled in droves. The coolies at each wharf also stopped working and temporarily avoided stray bullets. It stopped after about half an hour. The white landing craft fled Chunjiang Wharf at that time and sailed downstream. The No. 6 destroyer, seeing that we were prepared, also raised anchor and sailed east, to the east of the Izumo ship in front of the Gonghexin Wharf, and dropped anchor on the No. 3 river tube. Until the evening, the enemy ships shelled our Pudong area again, and our words immediately returned fire with heavy artillery. The mutual bombardment stopped after about half an hour. Later, at about 7:00 PM, the enemy troops used machine guns to sweep across the river near the Japanese Consulate General, but it was just to vent their anger and wasted bullets. At the same time, there were also three or four speedboats, fully loaded with enemy troops, cruising on the river surface near the Bund Park, seemingly with the intention of landing in Pudong again. However, our guard is strictly guarded. If the enemy comes to犯, they will definitely be severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Enemy Bombs Pudong Alcohol Factory</h3>
<p>From 1:30 PM to 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, enemy planes three times gathered a small team and flew to Bailianjing, Pudong, to bomb the alcohol factory. They dropped thirteen bombs before and after, but most of them fell in the fields. Although the alcohol factory was slightly damaged, many nearby houses were destroyed. Yesterday morning, after crossing the river to investigate, there were more than twenty injured and five dead on the spot, all of whom were villagers in the neighborhood. It was found that the alcohol factory had long been closed, and a British flag was hung on its roof. At the same time, there were the American Da Lai Steamship Company and the British Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory nearby. Most of the factories in the area were the property of foreigners, but the Japanese planes did not hesitate to bomb them, which proves that they did not care about public law. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, another enemy plane flew low over Nanshi along the Rihui Port area for reconnaissance, intermittently sweeping with machine guns. Before long, it flew to Pudong again.</p>
<p>Enemy planes were still active in all directions yesterday. At about 5:00 PM, they dropped bombs in Pudong, attempting to destroy our artillery positions in order to lift the threat to the enemy troops in the Yangshupu area. However, according to the report from the garrison in Pudong, the enemy dropped bombs aimlessly, so our positions were not damaged.</p>
<p>Enemy planes harass the rear in the Nanshi Pudong area every day, and the people suffer a lot. Yesterday morning, enemy planes flew to Nanshi for reconnaissance again, and used machine guns to扫射 when they saw pedestrians. From 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM, two enemy planes flew to the Nanhuangpu area of Pudong again for reconnaissance and扫射, and then flew to the Nanshi city area again,扫射 downward with machine guns. The residents in the city, who originally regarded the city center as a safe place, are now frightened three times a day. The enemy is angry and takes the massacre of civilians as their only skill, so from yesterday onwards, they have fled in droves, and only one or two out of ten people remain.</p>
<p>At about 10:00 AM and 2:00 PM yesterday, three enemy planes circled and reconnoitered in the Zhaobei area of Huxi Zhongshan Road and Jishifei Road浜, and扫射ed with machine guns, injuring an old woman. Two bombs were also dropped near Dachang by enemy planes, with very little damage. Also, from 11:00 AM to noon, enemy planes flew to Zhabei to bomb, and the Zhabei Power Distribution Company on Liuying Road was bombed and destroyed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Arrived Again, More Than Two Thousand People</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, another enemy cruiser, the Takenoura, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau Middle Pier. More than 2,000 enemy troops landed to reinforce the enemy troops in the Hongkou area.</p>
<p>According to people from Yangshupu, from 6:00 AM yesterday, Japanese military transport trucks in the Yangshupu and Hongkou districts were fully loaded with armed Japanese soldiers and transported heavy military supplies, rushing back and forth, heading to Hongkou Park and Yinxiang Township, very busy. Seeing this, the enemy army seems to be reorganizing the military in that area.</p>
<p>At dawn yesterday, an enemy transport ship arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Huangpu Road Mitsubishi Wharf, unloading a large number of burlap bags and defensive materials. It is said that the ship loaded the corpses of enemy soldiers and sailed back to Japan that evening.</p>
<h3>Enemy Transported Two More Ships of Munitions</h3>
<p>The enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, Tianjin Maru, Dairong Maru, Tottori Maru, Kinu Gasa Maru, and Dongtai Maru, that sailed to Shanghai the day before yesterday, except for the latter two, which had finished unloading the munitions and sailed out yesterday, the cargo of the remaining one had not been completely unloaded as of yesterday afternoon. And at 7:01 AM and 1:30 PM yesterday, the enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships No. 166 Unkai Maru and No. 89 Beifun Maru continued to sail to Shanghai, docking at the Huangpu and China Merchants Bureau Zhao piers, respectively. In addition to a large number of heavy weapons, such as armored vehicles, armored cars, tanks, etc., unloaded, there were also a large number of black large cars and more than a thousand barrels of gasoline, which were transported and landed. At present, the depots at each pier are stocked with enemy munitions and military supplies, with the Osaka and Huangpu piers having the most, but their important items are all stored in the China Merchants Bureau Middle and North piers.</p>
<h3>General Situation of Enemy Troops Along the River</h3>
<p>Since our army retreated to the first line of defense the day before yesterday for strategic reasons, this reporter went to the river to observe in person from 8:00 AM yesterday in order to understand the situation of the enemy troops along the river. The following is a summary of what I saw. The reporter set off from the Bund on a轮 yesterday morning. When the 轮 sailed past Lujiazui, I saw five enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships moored at the China Merchants Bureau Middle, North, Osaka, and Huangpu piers, unloading military supplies, very busy. The 轮 gradually sailed outward, seeing a fierce fire burning near the end of Yangshupu Road, Lan Road. Further ahead, I saw three big fires in the city center, burning so fiercely that it was rare before. The city's major buildings may have been reduced to ashes. Near the water plant, there were more than twenty enemy war horses, hauling field guns and heavy cannons, and three trucks carrying eighty or ninety enemy troops following behind, slowly driving towards the city center area of Jungong Road. An armored vehicle was also parked on Jungong Road, and the Jungong Road Bridge had been blown up. Further ahead to Zhang Huabang, I saw more than a dozen enemy trucks parked there, more than 300 war horses, and more than 300 army soldiers. To Yunzaobang, there were more than 500 enemy army soldiers, more than 100 war horses, and to Wusong Town, near the customs branch office there, there were four carriages for enemy拖 cannons. There were also more than 200 enemy army soldiers in Wusong Town. About 100 trucks were parked in the Wusongkou customs branch office area, and presumably a large number of enemy reinforcements had arrived. These trucks were to be used to transport the enemy troops to the front after landing. In total, there were many thatched sheds built from the Qujiang Wharf to the Wusongkou, and the scattered enemy troops along the river used these thatched sheds as their resting places. The above is the general situation of the reporter's inspection of the沿 River yesterday.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Enemy Ships Moved Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the results of the reporter's investigation at the river at 4:00 PM yesterday, the large base camp where the enemy ships sailing to Shanghai gathered can be divided into four, namely ① Wusongkou, ② Liuhuo, ③ Qujiang Wharf, ④ Pudong. A total of forty-nine enemy ships were anchored in the Wusongkou area, a total of twenty-six ships near the Qujiang Wharf, and a total of twenty-one ships in the Pudong River. Based on this estimate, the enemy ships anchored in the Liuhuo area should be around forty. The following is an investigation of the mooring situation of enemy ships in the Songkou and Qujiang Wharf area and in the Pudong River. (A) Wusongkou area, a total of five cruisers outside Songkou, fifteen transport ships, five gunboats, two destroyers, eleven ships from Wusongkou to Shizilin, one destroyer at the Wusongkou Customs Branch, the first, third, fifth, second, seventh, ninth No. eight hundred and three of Wusong Town. Ships such as two, one, eight, and five and two, two, one, and nine were transport ships (the names of the remaining three ships are unknown), and a gunboat on the River near Tongji University, a total of forty-nine ships (B) Qujiang Wharf area, a total of one gunboat each for No. 21 and No. 23 of the Jungong Road Water Plant, one gunboat opposite Gaogiao, two enemy ships No. 23 opposite Qujiang Wharf, sixteen enemy ships at Qujiang Wharf, one cruiser at the south head of Qujiang Wharf, one No. 21 destroyer, one No. 21 gunboat, one No. 23 destroyer opposite the fish market, and one No. 6 cruiser (already sailing outward) at the power plant, a total of twenty-six ships, (C) Pudong River, one gunboat each for No. 41, No. 36, No. 22, No. 16, No. 15, No. 14, and No. 11 floating docks, one destroyer each for No. 9, No. 8, No. 7, No. 6, No. 5, and No. 1 floating docks, one No. 2 floating dock Izumo flagship, one No. 11 destroyer at Mitsubishi Wharf, one cruiser at China Merchants Middle Pier, two enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships at China Merchants North Pier, one transport ship at Osaka Wharf, and two transport ships at Huangpu Wharf, a total of twenty-one ships. In total, from Shizilin outside Wusongkou to Pudong, there are a total of ninety-six enemy ships anchored.</p>
<h3>All Parties in Britain Express Sympathy for Our Army's Retreat in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Admiring the Brave Resistance of Our Soldiers</p>
<p>Central News Agency, London, 14th Reuters: All parties express sympathy upon hearing of the retreat of Chinese troops from the Shanghai area, and "unanimously express admiration for the Chinese troops' brave resistance with flesh and blood against the Japanese army's steel for five weeks." Furthermore, the British newspapers all disclosed the news about China in a prominent position, which shows the concern of the general public. The reports of the special reporters of the newspapers vividly depict the situation, which makes the readers increase their admiration for the bravery of the Chinese soldiers. Among the newspapers, the Daily Leader is the most outstanding, because the newspaper publishes Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek's telegram every day. This kind of war report is a good model for news reporting, and it is rich in news value, so it has aroused unanimous praise from the London newspaper area. Military observers here highly praised the Chinese army's retreat as rational, and regarded the Japanese army's re-stepping on the same path as the January 28th Incident as strange, because five years ago, the Japanese army invaded a place with no military value, which was not worth the loss, and today they are making the same mistake again. Furthermore, it can be clearly pointed out that when US policy is controlled by isolationist peace elements, the great powers have no intention of intervening. Opinions in official circles feel that it is still difficult to guess the outcome of the incident and the true content of Japan's objectives for the time being. Perhaps there is no clear overview in Tokyo either. However, the observation of the general public believes that North China is the main focus of Japan's intention, which is also the focus of Japan's objective. The Manchester Guardian said that after two months of the Sino-Japanese War, it can now be concluded that Japan's main effort will be in North China and not in Shanghai. Regardless of whether Japan can make China kneel down, it is still difficult to forget the possibility of war with the Soviet Union. Therefore, what Japan desperately hopes for is to insert a wedge between China and the Soviet Union and establish a defensive line in the northwest of China.</p>
<p>The report said that it is an undeniable fact that the Japanese army has won a great victory in North China, but the Japanese army has not yet defeated the main force of the Chinese army, and must deal with the famous Red Army, which is now preparing to harass the Japanese army. In addition, the land occupied by the Japanese army must also defend against guerrillas to ensure its safety. The guerrillas have proven to be a formidable enemy in "Manchukuo". The Morning Post published an editorial written by a special visitor who recently returned from North China, saying that the Japanese army has a wide range of operations, long transportation lines, and is always in danger of being destroyed by the enemy. The conditions of the plains and mountains give the Chinese army great convenience for guerrilla warfare. The Chinese army is good at this tactic. Although the Chinese army cannot drive out the Japanese army, it has the power to harass it and consume its fighting power. The real decisive battle will be in the winter months, when there will be approximately 350,000 Japanese troops on all fronts. Maintaining such a large army in a foreign war zone is as large as Europe, and the Japanese army cannot withstand the cold, which is all to the disadvantage of the Japanese army. The ability of China to support itself in terms of military supplies is now considered by all parties to be a key issue in the situation. Therefore, it is difficult to get support for the formal actual combat required by the Chinese newspapers, because after the declaration of war, China has very few obvious interests, and will automatically give Japan the right to inspect ships. As far as the current situation is concerned, Japan seems to be unwilling to interfere with foreign shipping beyond confirming nationality.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Advance to Sijing Ball Field</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting in the Municipal Cemetery Area Yesterday; We Strictly Guard Our New Position, the Enemy Collapsed in One Battle</p>
<p>Our army in the city center area has now moved back to the Songhu Road to Gaojingmiao Wanguo Recreation Ground Racecourse area. The enemy troops are now based in the Lujiajiao to Sijing Ball Field area east of the Yejia Garden behind the Municipal Government. The two armies had fierce battles there the night before last.</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy in the Sijing Ball Field area launched a fierce attack on our army's position at the Jiangwan Racecourse on Songhu Road. Our army's defense there was solid. After being severely attacked by us, the enemy suffered considerable losses. There was also artillery fire near the Zhabei Water Tower.</p>

The bombardment was fierce and did not stop until noon. The enemy suffered heavy damage. At the same time, a regiment of enemy troops near Gaojingmiao also advanced on our position. After the defending troops came out of the trenches to meet the attack, they came into contact with the enemy in front of the Municipal Cemetery and collapsed in one battle. We did not pursue and strictly guarded the new line of defense. According to a military officer, this kind of contact is probing in nature. The main battle within days must be in the Gaojingmiao Jiangwan area. We have deployed heavy troops and are prepared to inflict a blow on the enemy.</p>

<p>[Guangzhou] Consular circles report that regarding the bombing of Hui'an Hospital, the American envoy has telegraphed the Secretary of State to request intervention with Japan.

The danger to the lives and property of American nationals will become even greater in the future.

The forts of Dahu, Xiahu, Shajiao, Wei Yuan, and the coastal defense forces on both sides opened fire, bombarding them. The enemy warships, due to the changing waterways and unclear routes, hastily returned fire in defense. Two destroyers were damaged by our bombardment, and fifty enemies were killed. Our fleet is also on alert within the harbor. Fifteen of our planes flew from the province to assist in the battle. The enemy warships towed away the two damaged ships, one of which nearly sank.

<p>[Guangzhou] Chen Ce, commander of the Humen Fortress, spoke to a Central News Agency reporter by telephone on the morning of the 14th after repelling the enemy warships, saying that the enemy shells all landed outside the fortress, which shows that the enemy warships' combat power is weak, and they were instead hit by our artillery fire. The reporter told him that Tokyo Radio broadcast on the evening of the 13th that Japanese planes had completely destroyed Humen that day, and asked if this was true. Commander Chen said that there were no traces of enemy planes on the 13th. The enemy warships attacked on the morning of the 14th and fled in less than an hour, which is sufficient to prove the absurdity of the Japanese broadcast propaganda. He wondered how Tokyo Radio would justify itself in the evening broadcast. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Enemy warships attacked Humen on the 14th and were repelled by our defending troops, who returned fire, heavily damaging one ship and lightly damaging another.

<h3>Movement to Guarantee Families of Soldiers Resisting the Enemy</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] In light of the heavy casualties among soldiers at the front and the lack of assistance for their families, and in order to supplement the government's insufficient ability to provide relief, Wang Fusheng, an expert in national defense economics, has initiated the "Movement to Guarantee the Families of Soldiers Resisting the Enemy." His method is good and his intentions are noble, and it can serve as a reference for the people across the country to implement. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently visited Wang at his residence, and he told us about the origins and main points of the plan for initiating this movement. We are now disclosing it as follows: A. Origins: This time, the Chinese nation's war of resistance against the enemy is tragic and unprecedented. For example, Luo Fangzhuo's entire regiment of officers and soldiers died heroically at Nankou, and Yao Ziqing's entire battalion of officers and soldiers died heroically at Shi Shan. Their loyalty to the country and their willingness to die are truly moving to both heaven and earth. The people living in the rear, if they think of the heavy sacrifices made by the soldiers at the front, ask yourselves, what else can you cherish, what else is worth cherishing? In order to fulfill a little bit of the responsibility of us who have not died, we should at least share a little of the family responsibilities of the soldiers at the front who are protecting the lives and property of the entire nation and who are wounded or killed in action, and take care of their families so that we can comfort the spirits of the dead soldiers and inspire the will of the living soldiers. On the one hand, it is also enough to fulfill the responsibility and duty of the people in the rear. This is the reason why I initiated the Movement to Guarantee the Families of Soldiers Resisting the Enemy. B. Main Points of the Plan: 1. All national people's organizations should jointly organize a Committee to Guarantee the Families of Soldiers Resisting the Enemy, with a general office in Nanjing and branch offices in each province. 2. The general office should request a roster of officers and soldiers from each army and division participating in the war of resistance from the supreme military authority, and distribute the lists to each province and city according to the distance and proximity of each officer's and soldier's place of origin, so that the people in each place can separately assume the responsibility of guaranteeing the family of a certain officer or soldier. 3. All social organizations, foundations, or individuals with property or productive capacity must independently identify or be assigned by local organizations to assume the guarantee of one or more officer and soldier families. 4. When an officer or soldier whose family is guaranteed dies or is disabled in action against the enemy, the family should be paid a monthly or annual or one-time maintenance allowance, the amount of which should be determined based on the economic situation of the guarantor and the person being guaranteed. 5. The officer or soldier being guaranteed should be limited to those whose families have no brothers or property and who leave behind parents who are unable to work, as well as widows and orphans. 6. The contract between the guarantor and the person being guaranteed should have legal effect. This is only an outline, and detailed measures must be formulated separately.

<h3>The Japanese's Vicious Treatment of Traitors</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Enemy planes have been attacking for days, and traitors are active everywhere. The military police have repeatedly captured them and executed them by firing squad, which has pleased the people. However, these traitors are also pitiful. A certain intelligence officer told reporters that all traitors do not know who their leader is. It is said that there is also a layer of middle-level traitors, who are called "Japanese life traffickers" internally. All tasks such as hiring small traitors, managing them, and eliminating them are handled by the life traffickers. For example, if a certain person, A, is in charge of gathering ten small traitors, then the work and location of these ten people during enemy air raids will be arranged by A. When distributing money, A will transfer it. If each person can get ten yuan, A will deduct at least five yuan. When the situation is settled, A must also be responsible for cleaning up the lives of these ten people, either by poisoning or assassination. If one slips through the net, A himself will be in danger of his life, because he fears that they will leak information or be arrested and implicated, and that they will extort him endlessly, so he must kill them all to silence them. For example, in a certain area after a certain battle, many headless corpses were found. Most of the killed were coolies. The police could not find any clues for a while, and only later did they discover that they were all killed by the life traffickers and small traitors to silence them. Their methods can be said to be vicious. (Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Passes Agenda</h3>
<p>Indian Representative Elected Chairman, Decisions Made on Candidates for Chairmen of Various Committees</p>
<p>[Geneva] The 18th regular session of the League of Nations General Assembly continued this afternoon at 5:30 PM. The representatives of each country unanimously elected the chief representative of India, the Islamic leader Aga Khan, as the chairman of the General Assembly. After taking the chair, Aga Khan expressed his gratitude to the representatives of each country and gave a speech stating, "The need for international cooperation is even greater now than in the past. The West is under a storm, and so is the East. The principles of peace that we represent in the League of Nations have been severely hit. However, the League of Nations has achieved remarkable results in the past year, especially in the re-establishment of defense of the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits and the settlement of the Turkish minority issue in the Sanjak region of Syria, which we must not forget." Regarding Egypt's accession to the League of Nations as a member state, "From the standpoint of a Muslim, I deeply feel that the universality of the League of Nations is far from what it used to be." I hope that it will be able to overcome the most serious difficulties at present. The General Assembly then passed the agenda and appointed various committees, with the following candidates for chairmen: 1. Chairman of the Jurisprudence and Regulations Committee: Greek representative, the country's ambassador to France, Politis. 2. Chairman of the Financial and Economic Committee: Czech representative, the country's ambassador to France, Osuski. 3. Chairman of the Budget Committee: Uruguayan representative, Dr. Guani. 4. Chairman of the Social Issues Committee: Hungarian representative, Countess Apónyi. 5. Chairman of the Political Issues Committee: Colombian representative, Santos. 6. Chairman of the Agenda Committee: Belgian representative, Spaak. In addition, the Disarmament Committee will remain suspended as usual unless representatives of various countries submit a request, after which the General Assembly will appoint it.

<h3>Chilean Representative Submits Proposal</h3>
<p>Advocating Amendment of the Covenant to Universalize the League of Nations</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Assembly continued its meeting at 10:35 this morning. The Chilean representative, Eduardo, chairman of the Covenant Amendment Committee, proposed seeking ways to universalize the League of Nations to enhance its strength. Eduardo stated, "Various technical and health-related organizations affiliated with the League have been quite effective, precisely because these organizations are universal, with all nations participating. Therefore, the League of Nations should amend the Covenant articles to allow non-member states to join, opening the doors of the League, so that all non-member states may join. The time is now ripe. We should invite non-member states to express their opinions on both the amendment of the Covenant and the work of the League." (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Executive Yuan Re-elects Three Council Members</h3>
<p>Turkey Contesting for a Semi-Permanent Council Seat</p>
<p>[Geneva] The terms of the three non-permanent council members of the League of Nations Executive Yuan, Chile, Turkey, and Spain, are expiring this year. The voices for Chile and Spain are the loudest. Regarding the seat vacated by Turkey, it is reported that Iran has already submitted its candidacy and is supported by Turkey. As for the seat vacated by Spain, the country has decided to seek re-election. League of Nations figures believe that the key to whether Spain can be re-elected lies in the countries of South America and Turkey. This is because the South American countries are eager to repatriate the refugees of Madrid in their respective countries, which largely depends on the Spanish Republican government facilitating this matter. Only then can the South American countries support Spain's re-election. In addition, Turkey is also said to be intending to seek re-election. If so, the chances of Spain being elected will inevitably be diminished. However, as far as is generally known, the Turkish government has not yet decided its attitude on this matter. (Central News Agency, 13th, Geneva dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Newspaper Comments on Our Appeal to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>[London] The Daily Telegraph commented today on China's application to the League of Nations, saying that anyone who knows the truth of the world's current situation would not believe that the League of Nations could provide China with peace through collective action. We believe that even the applicant itself does not expect such a result. In fact, China's application is not only to the League of Nations but also to a major power that has never been a member of the League, namely the United States. The purpose of China's move is to sway world public opinion. Although the League of Nations, in its current structure, cannot be an executive force, it is still a tool for determining factors in international events and providing countries with an opportunity for fair adjudication. It would be shortsighted if the League of Nations were to disregard this value. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Failure of a Quick Victory Strategy: Japan's Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>Daily Military Expenditure Requires 20 Million; Prolonged War Will Inevitably Lead to Collapse</p>
<p>—Observations from the Soviet Union's Pravda—</p>
<p>[Moscow] Pravda published an article discussing the current situation in Japan, stating, "The Japanese warlords are currently in a difficult situation. The war against China has just begun, and Japanese imperialism has already encountered many difficulties both at the front and at home. The Japanese warlords had guaranteed their government and bourgeoisie that the war would end quickly and bring certain benefits, prompting them to support the military. However, the result has been to trap Japan in a long-term war. The Japanese commanders' strategic plan, which originally assumed that China would quickly succumb, has completely failed, ultimately leading Japan to spend increasingly more on military expenditures. According to calculations by its allies, the German fascist newspapers, who are paying close attention and cannot help but be alarmed, Japan's military expenditure in China has already reached 20 to 25 million yen per day, and by the end of this year, it should continue to increase fourfold or fivefold. At the same time, according to observations from Japanese domestic newspapers, the national budget for the next year will reach 5 billion yen, of which 3 billion will be military expenditure. This prospect has already caused complaints from the bourgeoisie. In short, the war against China has further exacerbated Japan's already overstretched economic structure. This is now completely clear. Many textile factories have gone bankrupt, and the market price of Japanese securities on the London Stock Exchange has fallen by 15 percent. The result of ordering large quantities of military supplies from abroad has led to a sharp outflow of gold. Each week that the war is prolonged, the domestic ruling camp becomes more panicked, and the illusory 'unity' constructed by the Konoe cabinet is also increasingly in danger of complete collapse."

<h3>Alumni Association of Students Returned from Japan's Statement to Japanese Cultural Circles</h3>
<p>Prevent Military Junta's Atrocities, Safeguard East Asian Peace</p>
<p>The Alumni Association of Students Returned from Japan, in view of the violent destruction of our cultural institutions by the brutal Japanese, disregarding humanitarian justice, and despising world public opinion, issued a statement to Japanese cultural circles yesterday, urging Japanese insightful and perceptive cultural figures to prevent the atrocities of the military junta and continue to safeguard East Asian peace. The original text is recorded below for the attention of various imperial universities, official and private universities, the Japan-China Society, the East Asia Common Culture Association, various news agencies, and cultural groups:</p>
<p>We, the Chinese nation, have cherished peace for thousands of years. The people of China and Japan initially had no deep-seated grudges or accumulated grievances. However, since the September 18th Incident, your military has repeatedly invaded our territory, damaged our sovereignty, slaughtered our innocent people, and destroyed our cultural institutions. Domestically, you control public opinion and oppress the people. Externally, you disregard public law and ignore good faith, sacrificing the lives of millions of soldiers as a tool for a few to gain promotions and seek titles. Those who are knowledgeable regret this. However, the young officers, instead of reflecting on themselves, have intensified their actions, provoking the Lugou Bridge Incident, invading North China, plotting to break into our Hongqiao Airport, increasing troops in Shanghai, forcibly conscripting reservists, and drastically increasing military budgets, leading to exorbitant taxes and soaring prices, disregarding the lives of the people at home, and attempting to make a desperate gamble to achieve their wild ambitions. Who would have thought that our entire country, compelled by national crisis, would unite in sincerity and courage, and that our loyal soldiers would forget their own lives and serve the country. Wherever the righteous army went, your troops were awestruck and fearful, their morale depressed, with casualties filling the roads, blood staining the banks of the Huangpu River, and corpses piling up in the fields of North China. The essence of your country has now become resentful spirits in a foreign land. Who caused this? Who is truly responsible? Your military's prestige has plummeted, and their madness has intensified. They disregard humanitarian justice, bombing our innocent refugees and destroying our North and South Universities, causing the hatred between the people of China and Japan to deepen. They seize the property of neutral countries and injure the envoys of neutral countries, causing an uproar in world public opinion, with disdain and hatred for them. The independence movement in Korea is flourishing, and the national revolution in Taiwan is intensifying. It is seen that your Japanese empire will become the enemy of all nations and will ultimately be unable to avoid the fate of demise. Therefore, we sincerely advise you, the cultural figures, who are the vanguard of society, to urgently take effective measures to curb the atrocities of the military junta, so that East Asian peace and the life of your country can be continuously preserved.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Offers Free Cholera Vaccinations</h3>

The public can contact the center directly. Vaccination hours are from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM daily. Employers who wish to have their workers vaccinated as a group should notify the Health Department of the details by telephone or in writing (telephone 12410).</p>
<h3>English-Language Shanghai Evening Post Comments on Our Military's Strategic Retreat</h3>
<p>Believes Action Taken According to Prearranged Plan; Zhabei and Pudong Positions Remain as Strong as Ever</p>
<p>The brutal Japanese, since launching their war of aggression in Shanghai, have been met with the blood and flesh of our loyal soldiers, who have been engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy's artillery fire for over a month, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Now, for strategic reasons, we have retreated to the first line of defense, holding firm positions, determined to wage a long-term resistance. Final victory will surely belong to us. The local English-language Shanghai Evening Post has made several comments on our military's planned retreat, which are translated below:</p>
<p>The Chinese troops, who yesterday (the 13th) carried out a planned retreat of about sixty to seventy kilometers to the strong defense line from Liuhe to the North Railway Station, are confident that they can prevent the enemy's advance. This arc-shaped new defense line began to be built after the outbreak of the Shanghai war. The Chinese military authorities had predetermined that they would inflict a heavy blow on the enemy when they landed and then retreat to hold this defense line firmly. Foreign military observers here believe that the Chinese army's retreat to the first line of defense is a planned strategic action, and they believe that this retreat should have been carried out last week. The reason why the Chinese army delayed is to inflict heavy casualties on the enemy and prevent them from establishing contact in various places along the river. After the Chinese army retreated, there was actually no change in the battle situation last night. The Japanese army is obviously acting cautiously and dare not go deep into the positions left by the Chinese army because of the danger of accidentally triggering landmines planted by the Chinese army. As for the Chinese army in Zhabei, there is no intention to withdraw. The positions there are as strong as ever. The Chinese army in Pudong is holding firm to its strong defense line. The Japanese army has repeatedly scouted the Chinese artillery positions there in the past few weeks and bombed them, but they have not hit anything and have gained nothing.</p>

<h3>Two Principles of Protracted Warfare</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Yesterday and the day before, our army made slight adjustments to its two positions in Yangxing and the city center of Jiangwan. These two positions were originally located in protruding parts of our main battle line, facing the enemy's fierce attacks and incurring significant attrition. However, this attrition was not absolutely necessary. Therefore, after the complete construction and consolidation of our first line of defense, our forward troops at these two locations each retreated five kilometers, removing the protruding sections and making the main defense line from Liuhe through Luodian, Liuhang, Dachang, Jiangwan, to Baziqiao a straight line. This shift in the adjusted positions was very calm and orderly. The enemy, intimidated by the remaining might of our army's heroic resistance over the past month and wary of the landmines planted by our army, did not dare to advance rashly. Our army, after being redeployed along the new defense line, immediately secured its position, inflicting fierce setbacks on the enemy's risky advances.</p>
<p>This rearrangement of the adjusted positions is considered very appropriate by many foreign military experts and causes us no losses. However, the enemy and the traitors they use have taken this opportunity to spread rumors, deceiving some people who lack military knowledge. This situation should be closely monitored and prevented during our resistance war. Therefore, we should briefly explain the two most basic principles of protracted warfare here so that the general public can have a clearer understanding of the significance of our recent strategic measures.</p>
<p>At present, our resistance against Japanese imperialism is a protracted war. We are not afraid of the expansion of the battle lines. We are not afraid of the increase in enemy troops. The basic reason is that the more dispersed the battle lines, the greater the enemy's attrition, which is more favorable to our protracted warfare. Under this plan of protracted warfare, we have adopted two principles: First, the gain or loss of one or two positions is not important in our overall plan of resistance because we will continue the resistance permanently until the enemy is exhausted and swept away from our land. Second, although we do not overemphasize the gain or loss of one or two positions, we must still make the enemy pay the greatest price for every inch of our territory they want to take.</p>
<p>The above two principles have been fully demonstrated in the Songhu resistance war over the past month. The enemy has reinforced three times, mobilizing six divisions and concentrating more than a hundred warships, yet they have only managed to gain a strip of land more than ten kilometers along our riverbank. The enemy's attack on Baoshan resulted in the loss of more than two regiments. The enemy's rush from Qiujiang Wharf into the city center the other day also triggered our army's landmines. For more than a week, the enemy has sacrificed greatly to seize Jungong Road to achieve contact between Yangshupu and Wusong. As of now, the losses the enemy has suffered in Shanghai are at least 20,000 or more, and the consumption of artillery shells and other military supplies has become an immeasurably large sum. In this situation, it is sufficient to prove that our protracted resistance has achieved great success.</p>
<p>When fighting on the riverbank, the enemy's warships and artillery can still recklessly display their blind bombardment. However, after our battle lines shift inland, the navy will have no use. In the land battle, our army will use solid positions and brave soldiers to make the enemy's blind and chaotic charges repeatedly suffer the fiercest counterattacks. We can be sure that in this situation of protracted warfare, the "clay-footed" Japanese imperialism will eventually be buried in the tomb of its own aggressive policy.</p>
<h3>Agreement Signed on Protecting Maritime Navigation Safety in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Copies Distributed to Italian and German Governments; Britain and France Dispatch Ships for Surveillance</p>
<p>[Geneva] Today, the meetings held here include the League of Nations Assembly, the final meeting of the Nyon Conference and the signing of the Mediterranean Agreement, the League of Nations Executive Council meeting, and the League of Nations Assembly Presidium meeting. The Nyon Agreement was implemented immediately after its signing. The British battleship "Malaya" has been ordered to sail to Mytilene in the Aegean Sea, demonstrating the determination of the powers to maintain safety in the Mediterranean. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The Admiralty announced that the flagship "Cairo" and the Fourth Destroyer Flotilla will soon sail to the Mediterranean. Upon arrival, there will be four and a half British destroyer flotillas, totaling thirty-six ships, and four flagships in the Mediterranean. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙ Brest, France Three destroyers belonging to the French Atlantic Fleet, namely the "Audacieux," "Épervier," and "Intrépide," as well as six torpedo boats, have been ordered to prepare to sail to the Mediterranean to perform surveillance missions to prevent piracy. Two other torpedo boats have already sailed to the waters off northwestern Spain. (Central News Agency, 13th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The European situation was quite tense last week, but it has greatly eased due to the results of the Nyon Conference. British and French diplomats have handed over the documents of the Nyon Agreement to Rome and Berlin, respectively. Those familiar with the matter observe that submarine attacks in the Mediterranean should be prevented thereafter. (13th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>⊙ Nyon, Switzerland The international agreement to prevent piracy in the Mediterranean was formally signed here today. French Foreign Minister Delbos and British Foreign Secretary Eden traveled here together by car from Geneva in the morning. After getting out of the car, they immediately held a closed-door meeting. Despite the heavy rain, the conference hall was decorated with flowers, and reporters and photographers from various countries were crowded. Delbos presided over the meeting and initially signed the agreement on behalf of France. The United Kingdom, Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia then signed in order according to the first letter of their country names.</p>
<p>Full Text of the Agreement</p>
<p>"Recently, merchant ships of various countries have been repeatedly attacked in the Mediterranean, and the attackers are not from either side of the Spanish Civil War. Therefore, the countries signing the Nyon Agreement have decided to order their respective naval fleets to take action to protect any merchant ships sailing in the Mediterranean that do not belong to either side of the Spanish Civil War. Any submarine that violates international regulations and attacks merchant ships should be retaliated against and, if possible, sunk. The signatory countries have decided to divide the Mediterranean by day into the following areas, each responsible for protection: ㊀ The western Mediterranean, including the British island of Malta, is to be monitored by the British and French naval fleets in both the high seas and territorial waters, but the Tyrrhenian Sea is not included in this area, and the monitoring measures will be decided separately later. ㊁ The eastern region, from Malta to the Suez Canal, is to be monitored by each country's own naval fleet in its own territorial waters, and by the British and French fleets in the high seas, except for the Adriatic Sea. The signatory countries have agreed to use submarines to ensure the safety of merchant ships, but the submarines must travel on the surface and must be close to the ships they are escorting, and their actions must be notified to all signatory countries at any time. In addition, no foreign submarines may enter the territorial waters of other countries. The signatory countries also recommend that their respective merchant ships should travel along the main Mediterranean routes jointly decided in advance."</p>
<p>This treaty, in addition to being signed by nine countries including Britain, France, and Russia, also allows any country to join by signing.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Various Countries Deliver Speeches</h3>
<p>After the signing, French Foreign Minister Delbos delivered a speech, pointing out the importance of the Nyon Agreement, saying that this agreement is sufficient to solve the problem of piracy in the Mediterranean. "Moreover, at this Mediterranean conference, the representatives of various countries all held good intentions, so the agreement could be quickly established. From now on, life in the Mediterranean will be protected, the safety of navigation will be guaranteed, and international morality will be maintained. This is what I dare to deeply congratulate the representatives of all countries present. As for various forms of aggression other than submarines, they should not be ignored and should be discussed at this session of the League of Nations Assembly. At the same time, the effective measures recommended at the Nyon Conference should be implemented immediately." Delbos added that Italy was originally invited to participate in the conference, and he hoped that it would accept joint cooperation in the future. In conclusion, he said, "The result of the Mediterranean conference is sufficient to demonstrate the effectiveness of the principle of collective security and is a model of international solidarity."</p>
<p>Then, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov delivered a speech, briefly stating that the Soviet delegation was deeply satisfied with the rapid establishment of the Nyon Agreement for the Mediterranean conference, but it was a pity that the protection of ships in the Mediterranean did not include ships belonging to the Spanish Republican government. He went on to say that the Nyon Agreement is the realization of the ideals of collective security and regional agreement, and that all countries participating in the Nyon Conference belong to the peace front. The Yugoslav representative also delivered a speech, expressing congratulations on the signing of the agreement. Finally, British Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a speech, congratulating Delbos for his guidance in this conference and thanking the representatives of the participating countries, saying that the work of the representatives was very beneficial and hoping that the agreement would be approved by the whole world and that the countries concerned would also be able to ratify it. At 1:05 PM, the Mediterranean Conference was declared closed, and the representatives of various countries returned to Geneva by car (Central News Agency, 14th, Havas dispatch).</p>
<h3>Italian Government Drafts Reply</h3>
<p>Rumored to Propose Reservations</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian government's reply to the invitation to participate in the Nyon Agreement will be issued tonight. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Italian sources claimed today that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has accepted the Nyon Agreement, but with "certain reservations." It is understood that Mussolini has agreed to the general provisions of the agreement. The so-called "reservations" are probably because Mussolini is dissatisfied with the scope of Italy's patrol in the Mediterranean, finding it too small. French sources said that Italy wants to be on an equal footing with Britain and France, while British observers said that Mussolini only wants to slightly expand the scope of Italy's patrol. (13th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Rome] According to well-informed sources here, the Italian authorities are extremely disgusted with the Nyon Agreement. Responsible persons also said that Britain and France are responsible for monitoring the entire Mediterranean, while Italy is only given a secondary position and is ordered to monitor a part of the Mediterranean, that is, the area designated by it (from the port of Genoa to Sardinia), which Italy cannot accept. Moreover, the agreement established by the Mediterranean Conference was published first, and Italy was notified later, which is also enough to make Italy feel unhappy. The Italian government is now exchanging views with the German authorities and will conduct talks with the British government before taking a final decision. In addition, Italian political figures have not commented much on Germany's non-participation in the Mediterranean monitoring program, but they believe that the Soviet Union's non-participation in the Mediterranean monitoring is a matter of course.

<h3>Nazi Party Congress Ends; Hitler Delivers Closing Address</h3>
<p>Spare No Effort to Criticize Communism; Does Not Want to Be Isolated Economically</p>
<p>⊙ Nuremberg Hitler attended the closing ceremony of the Nazi Party's annual congress last night and delivered a long speech lasting two and a half hours. The contents included ㊀ calling on countries around the world to jointly prevent the spread of the Red Peril and listing the dangers of the Communists' communization of the world, ㊁ explaining that Germany is grateful for the guarantee of its strong military forces and takes a calm attitude towards the international situation, and ㊂ pointing out that the Spanish civil war is also an example of Moscow's world revolution. It is a complete distortion of the facts to regard the Bolsheviks as legal and the national army as rebels because the struggle of the national army is like the struggle of Fascist Italy. Its purpose is to seek Western politics to be governed by Westerners and not to allow any international center to control it. Finally, Hitler solemnly declared that Germany refuses to join hands politically with the Bolsheviks who are destroying Europe. Economically, the figures for foreign trade can prove that Germany is by no means seeking economic isolation. Hitler asked, "We all have a great hope, that is, peace can be achieved, and the great cause of the country must be achieved over time." (14th, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Planned Trip to Germany</h3>
<p>[Rome] The proposal for Prime Minister Mussolini to visit Germany in return has been rumored for a long time. The itinerary has now been announced.

<p>From Apprentice Ironmonger to Father of the Nation: His Achievements Rival Those of Washington</p>
<p>⊙Prague, Czechoslovakia – Tomáš Masaryk, the founding father of Czechoslovakia and former President, had been ill since the [blank] day of this month, and his condition quickly deteriorated into pneumonia. Despite the best efforts of numerous doctors, he succumbed to old age and weakness, passing away at 3:30 this morning. The news of his death has plunged the nation into mourning. President Beneš and Prime Minister Hodža are attending to the funeral arrangements at the villa. Masaryk's wife, son, and daughter are also by his side. Crowds stand in silence before his residence, paying their respects. Many women are seen weeping, demonstrating the profound impact Masaryk had on the people. A summary of Masaryk's life and achievements is as follows:</p>
<p>Tomáš Masaryk was one of the great leaders of the post-World War I world. Throughout his life, he created the Czechoslovak Republic, and his accomplishments can be compared to those of George Washington. As a statesman and philosopher, his writings are abundant and his knowledge profound, rarely matched in his time. He was 87 years old. Born in the town of Hodonín (Göding) in the old Austro-Hungarian Empire, his father was a Slovak serf who was later freed and worked as a coachman and foreman for the imperial court. After graduating from elementary school, Masaryk went to Vienna as an apprentice ironmonger. However, dissatisfied with his circumstances, he returned to his hometown. With the help of a good teacher, he entered Brno High School. After graduating, he entered the University of Vienna, specializing in philosophy. In 1876, at the University of Leipzig in Germany, he met Charlotte Garrigue, an American woman. They fell in love and married in 1878, traveling to the United States together. The following year, he returned to the University of Vienna as a lecturer and earned a doctorate. In 1882, he became a professor of philosophy at the University of Prague, where he formed a group with many liberal scholars and politicians, with Masaryk as their core. From 1886 onwards, he promoted the spirit of science, opposed metaphysics, organized the Realist Party, and founded the newspaper *Čas* as a tool for propaganda. In 1891, he was elected as a member of parliament, but due to disagreements with other party members on strategy and personnel matters, he resigned in 1893. From that year onwards, Masaryk devoted himself to scientific research on the one hand and public education on the other, working diligently and conscientiously without interruption for ten years. At that time, young people in various universities had launched a nationalist movement, centered on Masaryk. In 1900, he organized the People's Party, and in 1907, he was re-elected as a member of parliament, advocating democracy in every way. When World War I broke out, he dedicated himself entirely to the Czech revolutionary movement. In early 1914, he published his masterpiece, *Russia and Europe*. After the book was published, it was banned by the Russian imperial government. In September of that year, he secretly went to the Netherlands to meet with British friends, reporting on the situation in the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the Allied powers. He then traveled to Italy and formally established relations with the Allied governments. However, due to the intense pursuit by the domestic authorities, he knew he could not return home and decided to organize a revolutionary movement abroad. In 1915, he organized the Czech National Council abroad, which was later renamed the Czechoslovak National Council. The current President of Czechoslovakia, Edvard Beneš, was also a key leader of the council. In February 1916, he went to France and met with the late French Foreign Minister Aristide Briand, continuing to report on the internal situation of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to the Allied powers and organizing Czech troops to join the Allied forces in the war. Due to these efforts, the late U.S. President Woodrow Wilson issued a declaration on January 10, 1917, stating that the liberation of the Czech nation was one of the war aims of the Allied powers. After the Russian Revolution of 1917, he traveled to St. Petersburg and organized Czech troops on the Eastern Front. Unfortunately, the Russian army was defeated, and Masaryk ordered these troops to withdraw through Siberia to Vladivostok. Subsequently, the Allied powers arranged for them to be transported back home by sea. In March 1918, he crossed the United States again and signed the Pittsburgh Agreement, deciding that the Czech and Slovak nations should unite to form an independent state. On October 18 of the same year, in the name of the National Council, he formally announced the overthrow of the Habsburg dynasty and organized a provisional government, with himself as provisional president and holding the positions of prime minister and finance minister. After the success of the revolution in 1918, he returned home and was elected as the first President of the Czechoslovak Republic by the National Assembly, and was repeatedly re-elected until December 14, 1935, when he retired due to his age of [blank] years, and was succeeded by the Foreign Minister, Edvard Beneš, his early revolutionary comrade. From that time on, he retired to the countryside, enjoying his later years until now. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>Statement by South African High Commissioner to the UK</p>
<p>⊙Montreal, Canada – Dr. Walter, the South African High Commissioner to London, stated here today that he firmly believes that if the return of Germany's former colonies does not affect South Africa's security, then South Africa will join the general agreement.

<h3>Hitler Encourages Armed Comrades</h3>
<p>⊙Nuremberg – German army units preparing to participate in the autumn maneuvers have gathered at the Zeppelinfeld in this city. Führer Hitler visited the field this afternoon to inspect them and delivered a speech praising Germany's military strength, stating: "At this time of international unrest, the reason we can still maintain peace is because we have military strength. A weak nation can never have happiness and peace; only a strong nation can speak of this. Germany's rise to power is due to the strength of our loyal and brave soldiers. Therefore, the nation is very proud of you." (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Chinese Embassy in France Denounces Japanese Propaganda</h3>
<p>Denies Engaging in Germ Warfare</p>
<p>[Paris] The Chinese Embassy recently issued a statement formally denying the Japanese claim that Chinese troops in Shanghai were engaging in germ warfare, causing many Japanese soldiers to suffer from cholera. The statement said that cholera epidemics occur every summer, and that the sanitary conditions in the refugee camps in Shanghai are very poor. More than 130 refugees have contracted cholera. The disease has also been found in Hong Kong and Nanjing. The Japanese claims are purely unfounded. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Sends Another Note to Japan Demanding Closure of Two Consulates</h3>
<p>Japanese Consuls in Novosibirsk and Vladivostok Not Allowed to Exercise Their Functions from Today</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government has consistently applied the principle of equal numbers of consulates on both sides. It has now informed the Japanese government that, from September 15th of this year, the Soviet Union will not recognize the right of Japanese consuls in Novosibirsk and Vladivostok to exercise their functions. The Soviet Union sent a note to Japan on May 11th of this year, stating that there were eight Japanese consulates in the Soviet Union, while there were only six Soviet consulates in Japan. Therefore, Japan was requested to close the aforementioned two Japanese consulates. According to the exchange of notes between the two sides in 1926, the number of consulates on both sides should be equal. Furthermore, there are no Japanese residents in the above two places except for the employees of the consulates, and there is no need for consular protection. Japan disputed this note. Therefore, the Soviet Union notified Japan today that it would no longer recognize the Japanese consuls in these two places from tomorrow. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Commander Yang Sends Representatives to Visit the Authorities of the Two Concessions</h3>
<p>Expresses the Shared Interest in Investigating and Arresting Traitors; Hopes That the Concession Authorities Will Offer Full Sympathy and Assistance</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in order to ensure local security, the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters is seriously investigating and arresting traitors. To ensure effective progress, Commander Yang has expressed his deep hope that the authorities of the two concessions will offer deep sympathy and practical assistance. Yesterday, Commander Yang specially sent representatives to visit the police authorities of the two concessions to discuss all matters. According to a spokesperson for the Garrison Headquarters, it is the Headquarters' duty to make efforts to investigate and arrest traitors in order to eliminate the source of chaos in the Shanghai area and to ensure local security. This is the same as the efforts of the concession authorities to protect the security of the concessions. The Headquarters has no objection to the various measures taken by the concession authorities for the purpose of protecting security. The concession authorities should naturally sympathize with the various measures taken by the Headquarters to investigate and arrest traitors. Furthermore, the conspiracies, organizations, plans, and actions of traitors, whether latent or discovered, are all in the concession areas in cases of major importance, and their impact on security in the concession areas is no less than, or may be even greater than, their impact on security in the areas under the jurisdiction of the Headquarters. This should not be ignored by the concession authorities in their efforts to protect the security of the concessions. All traitorous organizations and activities in the area should be severely cracked down upon and punished in order to achieve the goal of concession security. The Headquarters also believes that if the concession authorities truly want to ensure the security of the concessions, they must punish traitors to achieve their goal, as the disruptive actions of traitors are the real and actual threat to the security of the concessions, while other factors are not worth worrying about. Therefore, the Headquarters believes that the concession authorities should assist the Headquarters in investigating and arresting traitors. This is not only in accordance with the various good relations in the history of both sides, but also in the interest of ensuring the security of the concessions themselves. The concession authorities assisting the Headquarters in investigating and arresting traitors is tantamount to the concessions eliminating the source of chaos for themselves. In other words, the Headquarters investigating and arresting traitors in the concession areas is tantamount to assisting the concessions in eliminating the source of chaos. The concession authorities should naturally sympathize with this. The concession authorities should not consider the obvious dangerous organizations and activities of traitors, which are enough to endanger the security of the concessions, to be insignificant and ignore them. This intention was previously expressed to the reporters of the *North-China Daily News* and the *Shanghai Evening Post*, and the Shanghai newspapers reported on it. Now, based on the original intention, it is further extended, and it is still hoped that the concession authorities will base their actions on the various good relations in history and the shared interest in local security, and offer full sympathy and assistance to the Headquarters in investigating and arresting traitors in the concessions. In particular, in the case of the traitor Li Aidong recently handled by the Headquarters, the Public Concession Police have already provided assistance in accordance with the law, jointly escorting him to the competent court, and the court has ruled for extradition. After the ruling, the police representative did not raise any objection and accepted the judgment in court. It is hoped that the police will comply with the court's ruling and promptly hand him over to the Headquarters for transfer in accordance with the law, in order to complete the procedure for the concession authorities to assist in this case. This is a sincere hope.</p>

<h3>Foreign Troops Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>1,000 Italian Troops Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Over 1,000 U.S. Troops Will Arrive Soon</p>
<p>An Italian infantry regiment, with a total of 1,000 officers and soldiers, arrived in Shanghai yesterday aboard the mail ship *Calama* from Abyssinia. After disembarking, they went to the barracks on Jiaozhou Road. These troops will replace the Italian sailors currently stationed in a portion of the western district of the Public Concession.

<h3>Maritime Workers' Union Sends Telegram of Respect to Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>And Sends Telegrams of Condolence to the Soldiers on the Front Lines</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Hu, the special envoy of the Chinese Maritime Workers' Union, has been urging his subordinates to work tirelessly since the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai. In addition to actively coordinating all rear affairs, he also sent two telegrams of condolence, one to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and one to the soldiers on the front lines. The texts of the telegrams are as follows: ㊀ To Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission in Nanjing: The violence of the Japanese invaders has increased without end. They have seized Tianjin and Peking, invaded Shanghai, bombed our cities, killed our refugees, destroyed cultural institutions, blockaded coastal ports, obliterated justice, and isolated themselves from the world. We rely on your leadership to launch a full-scale war of resistance, to strike at the violent, and to crush the strong enemy wherever the flags point. Final victory will surely belong to us. In addition to exhausting the strength of our entire maritime workforce and using various methods to assist in the war of resistance, we respectfully send our condolences. We ask for your consideration. ㊁ To the soldiers on the front lines of the Pinghan, Jinpu, Pingsui, and Shanghai lines: The ambition of the Japanese invaders has not diminished, and pressure has been applied horizontally. Relying on their strong armor and weapons, they are attacking our various regions. We rely on your soldiers to fight bloody battles, to advance without hesitation, to sacrifice their lives for righteousness, to kill the enemy and achieve results, and to frequently report victories. We are filled with admiration. The revival of the Chinese nation is due to the merits of your war of resistance. Since the first blow has already been struck, final victory will not be difficult for us to achieve. We respectfully send our condolences. We ask for your consideration.</p>
<h3>Cholera Outbreak in the Two Concessions</h3>
<p>As of the day before yesterday (the 13th), the number of cholera cases in Shanghai, according to the second report from the Health Department of the French Municipal Council and the Health Department of the Public Concession, has reached 529, of which 450 are in the French Concession and 79 are in the Public Concession. Compared with the previously reported 235 cases, the percentage has increased to over 100%. It is reported that the majority are still refugees. One Russian foreigner has also been infected, and one has died.</p>
<h3>Three Focal Points for Relief Supplies</h3>
<p>Light Biscuits, Cotton Clothing, and Medicine: We Hope That All Sectors Will Donate Quickly</p>
<p>According to a conversation with the person in charge of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, in the future, citizens should concentrate their donations of relief supplies on the following three types to meet urgent needs: ㊀ Foodstuffs: Soldiers on the front lines are easily spotted by enemy aircraft when they light fires to cook during the day, and often a meal is destroyed by enemy artillery as soon as it is heated up. Therefore, it is very difficult for soldiers on the front lines to solve the problem of food. In view of this, the Association has specially asked experts to improve and manufacture "light biscuits." Each one costs 1.4 cents. These "light biscuits" are the same dry rations used by Qi Jiguang to suppress Japanese pirates in the past. After being improved, they are nutritious, can withstand hunger for a long time, and are easy to carry. They are indeed a more satisfactory food for soldiers fighting these days. Also, it is difficult for soldiers on the front lines to disinfect drinking water. A chemist has now invented a kind of drinking water disinfectant tablet. Placing one tablet in a pot of cold water is enough to disinfect it, so there is no need to boil it before drinking. Each yuan can buy 1,000 tablets. ㊁ Clothing: The weather is already turning cool in autumn, and soldiers on the front lines urgently need cotton vests. We hope that all sectors will enthusiastically manufacture and donate them. The dimensions can be inquired about at the Cotton Clothing Guild in Zhoujinli. Also, the previous appeal to all sectors to donate 10,000 cotton quilts is still far from being met. We urgently hope that all sectors will donate them quickly. ㊂ Medicines: In addition to soliciting donations from overseas Chinese, we hope that the citizens of this city will also donate more of various medicines needed by soldiers. For the above items, if you would like to donate money, please hand it over to the Shanghai Relief Committee for the Collection of Donations and Materials. (See today's newspaper advertisements for details. The association is the agent.)</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee Establishes National Salvation Savings</h3>
<p>Collections Will Be Made at Various Bond Payment Collection Agencies Starting Today; A National Salvation Savings Account Can Be Opened with One Yuan or More</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee Headquarters has established "National Salvation Savings" in order to encourage citizens to accumulate financial resources over the long term and broadly purchase national salvation bonds. Collections will begin today (the 15th) at various national salvation bond payment collection agencies. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Meaning of Savings</p>
<p>The publicity department of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee issued the original text of "The Meaning of National Salvation Savings" as follows: Now our committee has created a kind of "National Salvation Savings." The regulations have been formulated and entrusted to the various collection agencies for national salvation bond payments. The method is as follows: anyone who can take out one dollar can open a savings account with the collection agency and receive a savings booklet. Afterwards, they can continue to save and record it in the booklet at any time, regardless of the amount, until the day the national salvation bond issuance ends. At that time, a settlement will be made, and the Ministry of Finance will issue national salvation bonds of the same amount to the original collection agency for distribution to the individual savers. If the settlement amount is less than five yuan, or less than five yuan with a remainder, the saver can pay the difference or combine several savings accounts to make up the amount to exchange for a bond and clear the booklet. As for the interest on this savings, it is specified as a weekly rate of 4%, similar to the interest on ordinary savings deposits, and the timing and method of paying interest in the future will be exactly the same as for national salvation bonds. The national salvation savings booklet has the same effect as the receipt for the national salvation bond payment. National salvation savings also have an advantage, which is their continuity. Even if someone can immediately take out five yuan for several months, perhaps they would like to buy more gradually. They can also use the savings method to save the country over the long term. Those who are willing to donate a percentage of their salary each month may sometimes have a remainder. Using the savings method can avoid the hassle of finding and paying each time. The meaning of saving the country over the long term is extremely important. To be honest, the country needs our long-term efforts to be saved. Therefore, we must not underestimate national salvation savings. It will exert a great force in the future.</p>
<p>Savings Regulations</p>
<p>The National Salvation Savings Regulations, Article 1: The National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee has established national salvation savings in order to encourage citizens to accumulate financial resources over the long term and broadly purchase national salvation bonds, and will collect them in accordance with these regulations. Article 2: All national salvation bond payment collection agencies entrusted by the committee may act as national salvation savings collection agencies. Article 3: Anyone who can save and pay one yuan or more in legal currency may open a national salvation savings account with the collection agency, receive a savings booklet, and then continue to save at any time, regardless of the amount, and record it in the booklet until the date when the issuance of national salvation bonds ends, at which time a settlement will be made. Article 4: The interest on savings is calculated at a weekly rate of 4%. The timing and method of paying interest are in accordance with the regulations for national salvation bonds. Article 5: After the settlement of these savings, all multiples of five yuan or more will be given national salvation bonds of the same amount by the Ministry of Finance, which will be distributed to the individual savers by the original collection agency. If the settlement amount is less than five yuan, the saver may pay the difference in cash, or several accounts may be combined to make up the amount to exchange for a bond and clear the booklet. Article 6: This savings booklet has the same effect as the receipt for national salvation bonds.</p>
<p>Collection Agencies</p>
<p>The National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee has entrusted the main and branch offices of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, and the main and branch offices of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, as well as its designated first- and second-class post offices, as collection agencies for national salvation savings, and has entrusted their headquarters as the general collection agency.</p>

<h3>Ardent Enthusiasm, Reducing Food and Donating Money</h3>
<p>Those Who Live in Luxury and Fine Food: What Do They Feel When They Hear This?</p>
<p>Being in Prison, the Heart is in the Country</p>
<p>All the prisoners in the Second Special District Prison of this city, in view of the fact that the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai has lasted for more than [blank] months, are also very enthusiastic. In addition to donating more than 110 yuan in relief money before, they recently continued to reduce their food for 16 days, raising a total of more than 350 yuan in national currency, which was submitted by the warden and sent to the All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association for use as relief money to send to the front lines as a consolation. I wonder what the feelings of those who live in luxury and fine food are when they hear this?</p>
<p>Christians Pray for Blessings</p>
<p>All the Christians in this city, because the compatriots in the war zone are displaced and in dire straits, have decided to fast for one meal at noon on the 18th of this month (Saturday), and all the meal fees will be used to relieve the refugees. At that time, all the churches in the city will ring their bells to gather all the Christians in the city to hold a prayer at the Moore Memorial Church, to bless the Republic of China, and the Christian Association will notify the churches in various places to hold fasting prayers at the same time.</p>
<h3>Traitors in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai Conceal Themselves</h3>
<p>The Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai areas used to be centers for traitorous activities. Since the Garrison Headquarters strictly arrested and executed them according to law, the traitors have greatly concealed themselves. The Garrison Headquarters has also dispatched patrol teams in the above-mentioned areas from yesterday to completely eliminate the traitors.</p>
<h3>Curfew in the Western Hongkou Area at 6 PM</h3>
<p>Merchants and Residents Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>The curfew time in the Public Concession and the French Concession of this city was originally set to start at 10 PM every day. However, because it was felt to be inconvenient, both concessions changed it to start at 11:30 PM every day. However, the western Hongkou area north of the Suzhou Creek is close to the front lines and in a dangerous position, so the curfew is enforced from 6 PM every day, which is different from the curfew time in the Public Concession and the French Concession south of the Suzhou Creek. Merchants and residents in all sectors should pay attention.</p>
<h3>Postal Workers' Union Members Donate Salaries to Comfort Soldiers</h3>
<p>Over 1,800 National Currency Dollars Donated - Teams Organized into Squads for Separate Service</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union immediately organized transportation, rescue, intelligence, and secret investigation teams. They selected capable members to serve in different capacities. For the past month, the union's efforts in saving the nation have been quite intense. Recognizing that the ongoing war effort required substantial funds at the front lines, the union decided that all members should donate one percent of their salaries, totaling 1,820 National Currency dollars. Yesterday, this sum was remitted through the Bank of China to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek of the Military Affairs Commission for allocation to the front lines, along with a telegram of condolence.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Stipulates Market Opening Hours</h3>
<p>Opening Hours Set to Begin at 5:00 AM Every Morning - Survey of Essential Food Prices</p>

<h3>Tongji University Relocates to Zhejiang for Classes</h3>
<p>After the destruction of its campus in Wusong, the National Tongji University actively began efforts to resume classes and prepared for classes at 29 Difeng Road in Shanghai. However, due to the inconvenience of transportation in Shanghai and the dispersal of students in all directions, they were unable to come to Shanghai for studies. Moreover, due to the language barrier (the university uses German as the foreign language), it was not feasible to borrow classrooms from other schools. As the cultivation of practical talents is extremely important during the national resistance against Japan, the university president, Dr. Weng Zhilong, personally went to various locations in Zhejiang to seek a convenient and conducive location to hold classes. It is reported that Dr. Weng has now found a temporary campus in Jinhua County and will be relocating there in the coming days. Classes are expected to begin there within the next month. The plan to open classes in Shanghai has been cancelled. The university has also sent notices to students in various locations, informing them to gather in Jinhua in early October.</p>
<h3>China Vocational Supplementary School Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Fourth China Vocational Supplementary School affiliated to the China Vocational Education Society is scheduled to open today. To show consideration for the students, tuition is waived, and preferential treatment is offered for those taking two or more courses. As a result, enrollment has been very enthusiastic recently. It is reported that there are still vacancies in each department. The school address is on the third floor of the Shanghai Pudong Fellow Countrymen Association on Edward Road.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullet Injures Police Officer</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening at around 7:00 PM, police officer Li Keming (34 years old, from Hunan) was suddenly struck in the face by a stray bullet at the Xiaodongmen entrance in the Nanshi district. His left eye was severely injured. Another police officer reported the incident to the fire department, which dispatched an ambulance to take him to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>French Barracks Currently Require Firewood</h3>

The firewood must be delivered to the barracks no later than the 25th of this month. Transportation costs and other expenses will be borne by the successful merchant.</p>

<h3>Enemy Plans to Peek into Liuhang from Xinzhen, Shelling Heard, Attempt on Shui'an Bridge Failed</h3>
<p>Shelling Shakes Distant Areas, Our Positions Remain Undamaged - Enemy Repeatedly Harasses Jiangwan and Zhabei, All Repelled - Enemy Attempts to Land in Pudong, We Remain on High Alert</p>
<p>The focus of the war is currently centered on the areas east of Luodian, west of Xinzhen, and north of Liuhang. The line from Xinzhen to Yong'an Bridge is particularly targeted by artillery fire. The Luodian and Liuhe areas remain relatively quiet. Xinzhen is located between Yuepu and Luodian. Our troops have established a strong defense at Gujiage, west of Xinzhen. Yong'an Bridge is south of Xinzhen, serving as the central point between Yanghang and Liuhang. The enemy's plan is to infiltrate south from Xinzhen, converge with the enemy in Yanghang, and advance on Liuhang and Miaohang in multiple directions, attempting to cut off our military's communications. At dawn yesterday, a brigade of enemy troops advanced along Xiaojinzhaizi, west of Xinzhen, towards Dongzhixiang and Xizhixiang. Our loyal and brave soldiers, firmly defending the Gujiage area, rose up to fight the enemy. Intense fighting continued until late at night, resulting in heavy enemy casualties, forcing them to retreat. Simultaneously, another group of enemy troops harassed our positions west of Gujiage and at Shulibao and Wudoujing, east of Luodian. After several hours of bloody fighting, the enemy forces collapsed. We seized the opportunity to pursue and captured a significant amount of enemy supplies. This morning, the enemy again shelled our Yong'an Bridge with heavy artillery. The deafening sounds shook distant areas, but our positions suffered no damage. Currently, our troops are firmly defending the defensive fortifications from Yong'an Bridge northwards to Gujiage. The fortifications are exceptionally strong, and any enemy advance will be met with a head-on assault. In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, the enemy repeatedly sent small units to attack our positions at Huangxing Road, Baziqiao, Baoshan Road, and other locations. Intense gunfire and artillery exchanges occurred throughout the night. We calmly responded and held our original positions. After 8:00 AM this morning, apart from continuous enemy reconnaissance flights and sporadic gunfire, there was no intense fighting.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle at Yong'an Bridge All Day</h3>
<p>Our Troops Fiercely Attack the Enemy in the Middle Road at Xin Kaihe - Heavy Casualties Among Enemy Troops in Xiaojinzhaizi Area</p>
<p>After our troops firmly defended the first line of defense, the tense situation around Luodian gradually increased. At dawn yesterday, a large force of enemy troops, covered by more than ten enemy aircraft, attacked our troops east of Luodian. Intense fighting broke out under the concentrated fire of both sides. The battles between Gujiage and Yong'an Bridge, and along the Shulibao and Wudoujing lines, were exceptionally fierce, continuing in a bloody battle throughout the day. The enemy at Xinzhen launched a fierce attack on our forward positions at Xiaojinzhaizi, Xizhixiang, Dongzhixiang, and other locations. Our troops bravely fought back, showing no fear. Despite the enemy's artillery fire and tank charges, they resolutely held their ground. Fighting continued incessantly from morning to noon. Our troops at Lujiazai and Xinkaihe simultaneously advanced, fiercely attacking the enemy in the middle road. The enemy troops in the Xiaojinzhaizi and Dongzhixiang areas suffered heavy casualties, and their offensive was halted in that area, preventing them from advancing further. By evening, the intense fighting had subsided slightly. Our troops continued to firmly defend the positions from Yong'an Bridge to Gujiage. The fortifications on Yong'an Bridge are exceptionally strong. Any enemy advance will be a self-inflicted trap.</p>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reported that at approximately 8:00 AM this morning, enemy troops near Yong'an Bridge, west of Yanghang and between Liuhe, again attacked our alert line positions. Our troops bravely came out to meet them, and a fierce battle ensued. We bombarded the enemy with concentrated artillery fire, simultaneously covering our soldiers' bayonet charge. The enemy also resisted stubbornly. Fighting continued until noon.</p>
<h3>Enemy and Our Troops Confront Each Other at Jiangwan</h3>

<h3>Fierce Fighting at Baziqiao Last Night</h3>
<p>Our Troops Leapt Out of Trenches Shouting Battle Cries - Enemy Soldiers, Fearing Hand-to-Hand Combat, Retreated</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) A gentleman who participated in the battle at Baziqiao in Zhabei told us that at 7:30 PM last night, as darkness fell, the sound of gunfire was heard in the vicinity of Tiantong'an. Initially, it was sparse but grew denser and denser, indicating that the enemy troops had come to harass us again. About half an hour later, the gunfire suddenly stopped about 400-500 meters away from our positions. According to reports from the outposts, the enemy was probing our alert line and taking a flanking attack formation from the left and right wings, with no more than a hundred men. We had long known the enemy's strategy and feigned indifference. Another half hour passed, and the enemy indiscriminately fired machine guns, launching a fierce offensive. At that moment, a certain battalion commander of ours gave a shout, and everyone fixed bayonets, preparing for battle, and returned fire with machine guns. The two sides began a fierce battle that lasted for a long time. Our troops leapt out of the trenches, preparing to charge. As the battle cries rose, the enemy scattered and retreated. The enemy's fear is hand-to-hand combat. Attacking the enemy's weaknesses with our strengths is our effective strategy for driving away the enemy. By 9:30 PM, the enemy had disappeared. An inspection within the alert line revealed more than twenty enemy corpses and several military supplies. We suffered only five or six casualties.</p>
<h3>Enemy Repeatedly Attacks Tiantong'an</h3>

They were met with a head-on assault by our troops. Nineteen of the enemy who rushed out were sacrificed under our machine guns and grenades, leaving corpses scattered everywhere. The remaining enemy retreated to their original positions. Our troops suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Another group of enemy troops rushed out from behind the Liusan Garden in Tiantong'an and charged out from Guangzhong Road, attacking our positions at the Water and Electricity Road, Guangdong Middle School, and other locations. The enemy and our troops engaged in a fierce battle for control of the area yesterday afternoon. Fighting continued near the school last night. Guangdong Middle School remains in our hands.

<h3>Anti-War Movement Active in Japan</h3>
<p>Workers Burn Oil Refineries and Explosives Factories - Incident of Army Officers Spreading Rumors Occurs</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] According to a foreigner who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Japan, although the Japanese government has been using various false propaganda to anesthetize its people since the start of the war against China, those with a bit of reason all know it is wrong. In particular, the lower classes who bear the heaviest burden of the war are expressing their opposition to the war in various ways. For example, seamen in Kobe, dissatisfied with overtime and reduced pay, planned a strike a few days ago, but it was discovered by the police and the leaders were arrested. Also, the Marushin Oil Refinery near Niigata Prefecture was suddenly set on fire by workers on the 2nd of this month, destroying ninety crude oil and gasoline tanks. All workshops, laboratories, distillation equipment, and offices were burned to the ground, resulting in a loss of one million yuan. This incident was publicly reported in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on the 3rd of this month. Most notably, the so-called "incident of lower-ranking army officers spreading rumors" recently occurred in Ginza, Tokyo. The case is still under strict investigation. As for the explosion at the Kyoto Uji Explosives Factory earlier this month, the investigation has reportedly revealed that it was also committed by workers in the factory. In short, judging from the activities of the oppressed classes in Japan, the anti-war movement in that country is currently on the rise (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th).</p>
<h3>Italy Rejects Mediterranean Agreement</h3>

<h3>League of Nations Administrative Council Prepares to Discuss</h3>
<p>Our Country's Application</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Administrative Council has agreed to include China's application on the agenda of the current session of the Administrative Council. This decision was made after the Administrative Council held a closed meeting. It is reported that Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, will deliver a speech to the League of Nations General Assembly today (Reuters dispatch, 15th, Central News Agency).</p>
<p>[Geneva] At the opening of the 18th regular session of the League of Nations General Assembly tomorrow, Dr. Gu Weijun, the chief representative of China, will deliver an important speech on the dispute between China and Japan, defending the complaint filed by the Chinese government (Havas dispatch, 14th, Central News Agency).</p>
<p>⊙Ottawa The National Executive Committee of the Canadian Co-operative Social Association today issued a statement stating that Canada's economy is now rapidly becoming part of the Japanese war machine. Canada should immediately implement the Neutrality Act in the Sino-Japanese War, and that Canada's trade with Japan has greatly increased compared to a year ago. The Japanese warlords are now increasingly dependent on Canada for military supplies. The Canadian government should prohibit the shipment of war supplies to Japan (Reuters, 14th, Central News Agency).</p>
<h3>US Prohibits Ships from Carrying Munitions</h3>
<p>To China and Japan</p>
<p>[Washington] After consulting with Secretary of State Hull and others, President Roosevelt issued a statement stating, "From this day forward, all ships owned by the United States government are prohibited from loading various munitions and military supplies, as specified in the list I issued on May 1 of this year, destined for China and Japan, pending further orders. Other ships flying the American flag that transport the aforementioned munitions and military supplies to those countries will also bear all risks themselves before the government issues new orders" (Havas dispatch, 14th, Central News Agency).</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt issued an article today after meeting with Secretary of State Hull and others, stating that the new warnings issued by the authorities regarding shipping do not indicate that the government intends to invoke the Neutrality Act. The government's policy regarding the invocation of the Neutrality Act remains based on the twenty-four-hour basis. The US President also stated that all arms, ammunition, and other military supplies must be issued export licenses. Once the Neutrality Act is implemented, these exports must be stopped (Reuters dispatch, 14th, Central News Agency).</p>
<h3>Trivial Commentary</h3>
<p>— On Representatives</p>
<p>It is said that the Japanese Diet has publicly nominated twelve representatives who arrived in Shanghai the other day to offer comfort to the invading soldiers on the front lines. Furthermore, it is said that in addition to offering comfort, they also have the mission of investigating the actual situation of the war. This is indeed the expression that the eight million or so citizens, who are concerned about the national situation, should have. I have heard that Japanese domestic newspapers are proclaiming that on one front they have advanced to such-and-such province, and on another front they have advanced to such-and-such city. Now that you gentlemen have personally experienced the situation and observed the traces of war, you can only boast of the supreme achievement of our army's initial voluntary retreat from the city center, and you cannot but feel a great disappointment. If you gentlemen have some spare time, our country will sincerely invite you to visit Sincere Company, the South Railway Station, Songjiang Railway Station, and Beixinjing, etc., to witness the heroic miracles of your soldiers. It is thought that this trip will leave you with a deep and honorable impression. You will faithfully report to the people of your country.</p>

<h3>Yesterday, the China International Problems Research Association of the League of Nations Exposed the Atrocities of the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The China International Problems Research Association, led by its honorary director Yan Huiqing, and in the names of all directors including Li Zhaohuan, Liu Zhanen, Qian Yongming, Xu Xinliu, Dong Xianguang, Xu Shuxi, He Dekui, and Dai Zhiqian, sent a telegram to the League of Nations General Assembly exposing the atrocities of the Japanese army. The original telegram is translated below: Since China has had its culture, it has embraced the ideal of world peace. After Japan occupied Manchuria and other places in 1931, China's clear hope of peaceful coexistence with its neighbors has not wavered. In the past six years, China has tried to reach a peaceful solution to the disputes with Japan and fundamentally adjust the relations between the two countries. However, the Japanese warlords have continued to pursue their plan to invade and occupy Chinese territory without scruples. Now, a large part of North China, including Beijing and Tianjin, has been occupied by Japanese forces. Moreover, Japan has expanded its military aggression to Shanghai and its surrounding areas, causing a serious threat to China's national survival. In order to defend its territorial integrity and political independence, the Chinese government and people have no other way to follow except to rise up and resist at the cost of great sacrifice. Japan's military actions not only endanger the stability of East Asia, but also affect all other countries in the world. Therefore, we apply to the participating member states to immediately adopt the most effective measures in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant to limit Japan's aggression, so that the collective security system in the Far East can be preserved, and world peace can be maintained.</p>
<h3>The Relief Committee Released the Details of the Enemy's Bombing of Refugee Ships Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 400 People Were Killed and Wounded in the Bombing; Refugees Who Escaped Were Forced Back by Enemy Aircraft</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Committee released the details yesterday of the enemy's bombing of our refugee ships in Beixinjing. On the 13th of this month, the Gongxin Wheel sent nine civilian ships towed to Jiaxing, and the Xiemao Wheel sent twelve civilian ships towed to Suzhou, carrying a total of 2,189 refugees. Security guards Zhang Qingzhou and Wang Wenqing, and escorts Jin Dongting and Cheng Xiwu were sent along to take care of them. At 4:30 in the afternoon, when they were sailing on the Yujidun River in Beixinjing, two enemy planes suddenly flew low to偵察, circling for several weeks, and dropped heavy bombs. The first bomb hit the first tugboat of the Gongxin Wheel, which sank immediately. The second bomb hit the fourth and fifth tugboats of the Xiemao Wheel, which also sank. At that time, a total of more than 400 innocent refugees were killed and wounded in the bombing. After dropping the bombs, the enemy planes used machine guns to strafe the refugees who escaped, which was inhumane. Afterwards, the committee notified various charitable organizations to rush to rescue them, and sent the injured to Renji Hospital, the First Wounded Soldiers Hospital, the Seventh Rescue Team, and other places for treatment. The bodies of those killed in the bombing were taken care of by the burial team, the Red Cross, and the Tongren Fuyuan Hall. The refugees who escaped all walked to the area adjacent to the French Concession on Bailinan Road and slept in the open, and then encountered heavy rain, which was very miserable. At 9:00 yesterday morning, more cars were sent to load the refugees so that they could be sent back to their hometowns. At that time, enemy planes came to investigate again, causing the refugees who had boarded the cars to flee in panic. The committee has prepared food for the refugees to fill their stomachs, and at the same time is trying to send them back to their hometowns again. According to statistics, the committee has sent more than 60,000 refugees in succession.</p>
<p>In addition, according to a letter from the Finance Group of the Suzhou Fellow Villagers Association Relief Committee in Shanghai, our association and the Suzhou Red Cross jointly sent refugees back to their hometowns a total of seven times. On August 25, 350 people were sent; on the 26th, 110 people; on the 28th, 817 people; on the 29th, 600 people; on the 30th, 376 people; on September 1, 1,020 people; and on the 4th, 814 people, totaling 4,087 people. All arrived in Suzhou safely, and each time there were responsible persons and Boy Scouts to protect them along the way, with detailed reports. Moreover, the departure time was always at night, so it was relatively safe. The report that the refugee ship heading to Suzhou was bombed in Beixinjing was not sent by our association. It is hoped that the above situation will be announced to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Tragic Scene of Corpses Left Behind After the Enemy's Bombing of Beixinjing</h3>
<h3>Donate Clothes and Quilts to Refugees Quickly in the Cool Autumn Night</h3>
<p>Charitable Organizations Urgently Request Donations of Cotton Clothes, Quilts, and Cash from All Sectors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Relief Disaster Relief Association Refugee Relief Committee in War Zone, recently, in view of the cold weather, and that the more than 30,000 refugees it has taken in have mostly escaped alone, and that their clothing is mostly inadequate, at this time of cool autumn nights, if there are no clothes and quilts to keep out the cold, it is easy to cause disease to the wandering bodies. Once they are ill, their pain is even more unbearable. Although the association is actively purchasing clothes, how can hundreds and thousands of clothes be enough for more than 30,000 refugees? The difference is huge, and it is far from enough. At this time of financial constraints, there are still concerns about the food supply. Where can we get huge sums of money to purchase clothes and quilts? Therefore, we can only urge people from all walks of life to be compassionate and actively donate cotton-padded clothes, quilts, or cash, or widely solicit donations on behalf of others, so that tens of thousands of victims will not suffer from cold and hunger. In order to facilitate donations from all walks of life nearby, the association has designated the following five locations to collect clothes and quilts: ㊀ West District, Jueyuan Neijingye Society Shelter at the intersection of Avenue Road and Hardoon Road; ㊁ East District, Ball Field Shelter across from the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road; ㊂ South District, Zunsheng Shelter in the French Tibetan Temple on Jill Road; ㊃ Northwest District, the Taxation Shelter of the Second Taxation School on Kang Nao Tu Road; ㊄ Southwest District, Xuhui Shepherd Shelter in Xuhui Middle School, Xujiahui.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War on August 13, refugees in the war zone have fled in a hurry, and their family property has been lost. At this time of cool autumn, food and clothing have become a problem. The refugee shelters of the International Relief Association are all built with sheds, which are colder than other shelters. The association has decided to rush to make 1,000 cotton quilts and 2,000 cotton clothes, but this is a drop in the bucket and far from enough. The association appeals to all sectors of society, and respectfully asks kind people from all walks of life to generously help with relief, no matter how big or small, new or old clothes or fabrics are, please send them to the association at No. 318, 3rd Floor, Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA.</p>
<p>The wartime service group of the Boy Scouts of this city, in order to collect winter clothes and help refugees, yesterday, led by the collection team leader Zhang Jiazhen, sent more than a dozen Girl Scouts to Jing'an Temple Road, Xieqiao Lane, Tongfuli and other places to solicit winter clothes. A total of 378 pieces of men's and women's clothing, 81 pairs of shoes, 3 bundles of socks, and 17 flower tires and quilts were donated. They will continue to set off to solicit donations today.</p>
<h3>Registration of Design Society's Specialized Talents by the Support Association</h3>
<p>Enrich the Anti-Enemy Support Work and Be Prepared for Future Needs</p>
<p>The Design Committee of the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association is now holding a registration of specialized talents in order to meet the needs of the long-term war, so as to be employed when needed in the future, and to enrich the anti-enemy support work. All those with specialized skills who are prepared to serve the country, but have not registered with various organizations and groups in the city (such as academic and professional groups, etc.), may personally go to the temporary registration office for specialized talents of the association (No. 4, Lane 587, Yu Qiaqing Road) to collect a form for registration. The time is from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. every day.</p>
<h3>The Atrocities of the Brutal Enemy Invading and Ravaging the Counties of Songhu and Baoshan</h3>
<p>More Than 100,000 Refugees Will Suffer from Cold and Hunger; Forcing Our Strong Men to Charge into the Line of Fire</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai War broke out, the enemy has suffered losses in Hongkou and Yangshupu, so they expanded the war outwards. In Baoshan County, from Shizilin in the east to Yanglinkou in the west, there are enemy troops attempting to land. Afterwards, the enemy troops, with their sharp weapons, under the cover of heavy artillery and airplanes, fiercely attacked our army's positions, so that the entire territory of Baoshan, under the ravages of the brutal enemy, has almost no land for peaceful living. The fields are barren, and the residents are wandering in gullies. The tragedy is unspeakable. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Misery of Wandering is Unbearable to Witness</p>
<p>The total population of Baoshan is about 300,000. This time, they suddenly suffered the brutal enemy's invasion. The general residents took their old and young, enduring hunger and cold, and fled the war zone. The fellow villagers in Shanghai also rose up to organize refugee relief groups to rescue the refugees from danger in the war zone. Later, due to the fierce fighting and the expansion of the war zone, it became more difficult to provide relief. Relief vehicles could not enter, so the residents within the territory could only walk to the area in the northwest of Shanghai to be transported to Shanghai by relief groups. However, not a few people have been hit by stray bullets along the way, and it is unknown how many refugees have been killed by enemy planes indiscriminately bombing. At present, the county has rescued about 100,000 refugees, but with the limited capacity of the shelters in the city, it is even more difficult to arrange them. Moreover, the refugees have escaped, and all the necessary items cannot be taken out. As the weather becomes colder day by day, these more than 100,000 refugees will suffer from cold and hunger.</p>
<p>Fields and Agricultural Products Are Severely Ravaged</p>
<p>There is still a part of the residents who, because they are waiting for the autumn harvest, cannot bear to abandon their fields. Even under the intensive artillery fire, they still cultivate their fields. After the brutal enemy invades a village or town, they must carry out a search, and order the residents to stop all field work. Strong men are given Japanese clothes and forced to wear them to charge into the line of fire. The older ones are ordered to serve the enemy, and the old, weak, women, and children are thrown into the fire pit when the houses are set on fire. Their inhumanity has reached its extreme. According to statistics, the area's main income is cotton and rice. The grain could have been harvested this month, but unfortunately it was lost. This item alone is worth more than 6 million yuan, not to mention other items.</p>
<p>Traitors and Ronin Set Fires and Kill People</p>
<p>Almost all the cities and towns and villages under the jurisdiction of Baoshan have been set on fire and killed by the brutal enemy and the traitors and Ronin instigated by the brutal enemy. Broken walls and ruins, and corpses are everywhere, which is unbearable to witness. The true face of the brutal enemy's險狠 is fully exposed at this point.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Women's Comfort Association Announces the Amount of Donations</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Women's Comfort Association for Self-Defense and Resistance Against Japan has been working very hard. People from all walks of life have also been very active in donating money and goods. It is heard that the association has decided to publish the amount of donations, membership fees, goods, and all expenses in the Shen Bao on September 17 and in the Ta Kung Pao on September 18. It is hoped that people from all walks of life who donate money and goods will pay attention.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Medicine Community Relief Corps Hopes for Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the battlefield rescue team of the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Community Relief Corps has been setting off to the front line every day to work hard to rescue people, and has rescued no less than 400 wounded soldiers and refugees. The team is led by Captain Xu Wei, who is extremely brave and often performs rescues on the front line where bullets are raining down, which is highly praised by our military authorities. According to Captain Xu, the team's expenses are all donated by medical and pharmaceutical organizations, and no donations have been solicited from the outside world. The team has been extremely tight on budget. The war zone is expanding day by day, but there is only one truck, which is very difficult. Currently, the team members need trucks, medicines, gasoline, quilts, and other items, and deeply hope that kind people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate. If there are donations of the above items, they can be sent directly to the New China Medical College in Wangjiaku, Xiade Road, and transferred to the team.</p>
<p>Effective Hemostatic Recipe</p>
<p>At this extraordinary time, stray bullets are flying everywhere, and there are dangers lurking everywhere. However, the wounded often die due to excessive bleeding. Here is a good hemostatic recipe from Physician Gao Lishan, recorded below. Take one-quarter of white rattan, one-quarter of marine saltpeter (i.e., black fish bones), and grind them together into a powder. It is hoped that large and small pharmacies in the city will prepare more of this medicine, so that if they see compatriots who have been wounded, they can immediately apply this medicine urgently, and then send them to the hospital for treatment, so as not to die from their injuries.</p>
