<p>班禪回藏</p>
<p>關於班禪回藏問題、現在還未順利解决、拉薩政府方面、仍然採取明迎暗拒的政策、曩者札薩索康與班禪代表班堪布、在鄧柯之青科寺會晤、事前雙方都請本人派員參加、當卽派定參軍羅海寬、視察員鄭少成前往、囑以屆時力主藏政府應遵從中央意旨歡迎班禪回藏現在班禪雖承認不經昌都拉薩、從間道徑入後藏、而拉薩政府還是要求班禪不帶護送人員曁儀仗隊同行、因之談判又告中止、我想中央為保持威信計、一定要促班禪早日回藏、日前班禪曾派其秘書長劉家駒到康、商談回藏辦法、本人除遵照中央意旨切實奉行外並無其他成見、當派總參議許鐵峯趕赴玉樹答謝并致始終崇信佛法願負康藏護法責任之意、這個問題本人預料最短期內、當有解决希望、上述的是本人在康的幾種經過、說到建委會移康後、政務的推行、也只有下列幾件事實、</p>
<p>减免賦稅</p>
<p>康區被災旣重、所有全境糧賦及牲畜稅等、自應分別减免以慰遺黎、計丹巴道孚鑪霍甘孜康定五縣、全免二十五年度地糧牲稅、瞻化巴安理化白玉德格滬定雅江七縣、半免二十五年度地糧牲稅、九龍鄧柯石渠二縣各免二十五年度地糧牲稅三脭、計共减免正糧七七七六石餘、下糧三七九石餘、</p>

<p>改善烏拉</p>
<p>烏拉為西康唯一交通工具、行之已久、弊賓叢生不獨人民共受其累、官廳亦時感不便、乃由建委會召集全康民衆大會、商討改善烏拉制度辦法、並重訂新章、通令遵守至湯打役概予廢除、</p>
<p>辦訓練班</p>
<p>保甲訓練所、行課已經十幾週、馬上就要畢業了將來組織民衆、打破土制隔膜以後、一切政令自可深入民間縣政人員訓練班、已在成都考取了五十名、已經帶往康定從事訓練、義敎師資訓練班、亦已定於四月二日開課、統計人員訓練班、現正籌備中、</p>
<p>推行法幣</p>
<p>西康各縣土地狀况、田賦情形、以及牲畜屠宰各稅數字、向無確實統計、時已製定各種調查表飭縣實填實報、并派員赴關外實地調查、再康定幣制極形複雜、經建委會採取漸進辦法、以推行法幣、除各稅務機關、一律征收法幣外、另規定藏洋錠銀與法幣之折合價格禁止割裂硬幣、現法幣在康日漸通行且以康區金融板滯、商民夙感不便、內外滙兌頗費時日、現由建委會籌定基金、于前月中旬已得中央批准、成立地方銀行、本月卽可從事設備營業此後西康金融、可暢其流、</p>
<p>整頓團隊</p>
<p>團隊因土制濟力的存在、一時固難澈底整理、而循序漸進、當可計日成功、現鑢九丹等縣、並已遵照剿匪各省民團整理條例之規定、自二十五年度十一、十二兩月施以軍事訓練、以冀樹之風聲、並清查戶口、實行連坐、將匪首方吉廷鄭子明等正法於康定、最近正辦理各縣自衛槍枝之登記烙印事宜、</p>

<h3>納稅會反對增捐昨發表告納稅西人書</h3>
<p>惟有握緊我們的口袋　能使工部局知所警惕</p>
<p>本市公共租界納稅華人會、為反對增捐發表告納稅西人書云、租界的畸形組織、使中外納稅人不能够一堂聚晤、共商要政、這是何等抱憾的事情、現在我們利用這個機會、使諸位明瞭、對這次工部局建議加捐、本定本年七月一號、而現延期六月一事、我們所抱的意見、中國納稅人相信工部局假使情願的話、可以不必藉加捐而已經能够維持收支的平衡、我們把本年的預算細細研究、覺得工部局對於捐稅收入、特別是總捐一項、估計未免過份悲觀、而所有一切節約辦法、大都不澈底、而且輕重倒置、我們要曉得、總捐的收入、一向是非常穩定而可靠的、在過去十年、逐年呈增長狀態、僅僅在一九三六年短少七十萬元、然而這短少之數、完全在上半年、到下半年又已恢復常熊、不但實收實付額、已經達到一九三五年下半年百分之百零一、就是應收應付額、也已恢復到百分之九八、所以一九三七年的總捐、收入至少可以達到一九三五年的數目、是在情理之內的、假使我們以過去的稅收情形為標準、加以目前經濟好轉的現象、也許稅收數目、反而可以增加、而逐漸恢復前此的增加比率、並非過份樂觀呢、工部局的收入、逐年增加、而工部局的支出、也是逐年增加、有時比收入的增加還要快、這是值得注意的、目前經濟困難的主要原因、是為的在一九三○年及一九三一年收入方面、只有常態的增加、而支出方面、却呈急遽而反常態的擴大、就是在一九三六年稅收方面、比較一九三五年短少約二十萬元、而支出方面、反而多出一百二十萬元、假使我們記得工部局累年積欠未付總捐之數達二百五十萬元之鉅、等於二厘加捐之一年總收入、則對於財政困難癥結所在、已不難探得了、當然、我們不能抹殺工部局節約的政策、我門曉得、工部局火政的緊縮、年省二十萬元、取消駢枝機關、年省約十萬元、但是我們也曉得、工部局曾一次付與退職的工務處長如前者之數、一次付與辭職的總辦如後者之數、至員司緊縮、年省一百零六萬元、但是匯兌補償金、反改成永遠性質、其數在一九三六年為一百八十八萬元、此外九十餘高級職員、另加新匯兌補償金、工部局對於高級員司的優待、不但華人、就是西人也常常不滿、中外各報、常有相同的論調發表、至音樂隊在繁榮時期、固然是文化的娛樂、但在衰落時期、就變成奢侈品、其取消之議、大部西人亦所贊成、卽解散俄隊、也何常不如此、某西人謂、俄隊僅僅是“兒戲軍隊”、實在並非過份、此外各行政處費用、增加之速、如警務處在一九二九年、尚不過五百五十萬元、而到一九三一年竟增到九百餘萬元、兩年之內、增加四百餘萬、實是中外納稅人同感惶懼而要問、“如此澎漲有所底止嗎”所以我們反對增捐、並非出於自利之一念、而實在是響應外僑人士健全中正的公意、工部局總董說、所加之數、極為低微、譬如月付十元房租者、僅加二角、須知我們之反對、並不在金錢方面着想、如總董所說明、我們相信目前之財政困難、是多年浪費的總結果、惟有握緊我們的口袋、方能够使工部局在管理財政知所警惕、我們所爭者在原則、不在數目之大小、至所云上海捐率、視世界各地為低、並不足為加捐之理由、顯然可見、現在工部局已决定延長六月、昨天我們開會通過議案如下、公共租界工部局提議自二十六年七月一日起增捐一案、應延至明年度、再行核議、並令工部局於本年內切實縮减不必要開支、催收欠捐、以求合理、措辭含意、甚為明顯、貴會假使能够採行同一的議案、只要精神上實際上同我們相符、不一定拘泥文字、那我們是極表歡迎的、</p>
<h3>六省市糧商代表謁程天固</h3>
<p>為粵免洋米稅　陳述利害意見</p>
<p>粵省免征洋米稅一事、經長江流域五省市之力爭、現政府俯順輿情、正在重行審義中、實業部次長程天固、並將於今日（十四日）赴粵、除接洽瓊崖考察團事外、對該省糧食實况、蔣親為調查、六省市糧商代表顧馨一陳子彝、由市商會委員駱清華、於昨晨十時許、偕同至程次長旅邸、晋</p>
<p>謁程次長</p>
<p>首由駱清華等申述來意、並說明粵省免征洋米稅影響國米銷路情形後、程次長以雙方各執理由、事實究屬如何、須俟本人抵粵後詳加調查、始能明瞭、當着各代表擬具節略送閱、以憑核辦、各代表卽辭出、</p>
<p>糧商意見</p>
<p>又據糧商代表、昨日向新聞界發表關於粵省免征洋米稅意見云、㊀今以廣東一省請求免征洋米稅、使洋米整批進口、國米停滯、影響華中六省市農商、其利害孰重、請輿論界主持公道、㊁去歲各地豐收、各業向榮、各種物價、無一不高漲、使農民負担加重、支出日增、獨米價一如其舊、且有下跌之勢、則於農民經濟之影響如何、亦請輿論界加以公正之判析㊂今因粵省請求免征洋米稅、其他沿海各省市、亦將藉口缺米、相繼請求免征洋米稅、則不獨影饗國稅收入、且將恢復過去洋米充塞國內市場之情形、其利害所及、更不可思議、此亦應請輿論界分令陳說其利害、總之、粵省初以缺米之故、經請中央予以救濟、中央曾令財實交三部、將各地多餘米糧充分接濟、當玆各省正源源接濟粵米慌、使粵省米荒得逐漸平定之際、忽有實行免征洋米稅之舉、似非所當、</p>
<h3>蘇省府重申禁烟通令</h3>
<p>明年完全禁絕期近　烟民不得再增吸量</p>
<p>大公社云、江蘇省政府以該省禁烟工作、已屆第三年度、至明年第四年度、须一律完全禁絕、昨特通令本市鄰近上海•寶山•嘉定•等各縣縣政府云、查本省禁烟、已屆第三年度、所有未戒烟民、依照四年禁絕計劃、應於第四年度、（卽民國二十七年九月三十日以前）完全戒絕、在規定戒絕年限內、並須依照本省限期禁烟取締吸戶實施辦法第六條規定、分期减少吸量、乃近查各縣未戒烟民、其能依照規定减少吸量者、固屬甚少、而申請增加吸量者、且有發現、衡諸分年遞减、限期禁絕之旨、殊屬不合、省禁烟委員會規定、烟民隱匿吸量、呈報不實者、准予申請增加、此項規定、係指初期登記烟民而言、現在本省距禁絕限期為時已近、絕對不容許再有增加吸量情事、如查明有增報吸量、供人吸食者、准予從嚴究治、以肅禁政云云、</p>
<h3>浙省沿海漁業情况</h3>
<p>實業部調查員昨日返滬　今赴松江金山一帶視察　後日再至常熟南通等地</p>
<p>實業部派赴江浙沿海一帶視察漁業狀况之饒用泌劉崇德等業於昨晨（十三日）由浙屬沿海視察完畢來滬、今日（十四日）卽將赴松江金山沿海一帶視察、後日再出發至常熟南通•如皋．鹽城•海門•等處繼續視察中央社記者、昨晤饒劉二氏、據談視察浙江沿海各處漁民生活狀况如下、</p>
<p>視察三週較為詳盡</p>
<p>此次所經之地、有定海鎮海寗波象山溫州瑞安平陽玉環等縣所屬漁村、自上月二十一日出發、迄今將三星期、對於舟山羣島及嵊泗列島視察較為詳盡蓋此處在漁業上尤關重要也、但惜以未值魚汛時期、故猶感美中不足也、</p>
<p>捕魚技術均係舊法</p>
<p>在浙屬沿海各處漁民在經騐上、頗稱豐富故收獲亦豐、在捕魚技術方面雖均係舊法但以目前漁民經濟情形之艱難、以及彼等運用舊法之熟練、故亦稱適宜該處福建帮漁民、大多用延繩鈞、過去因所製銅鈞較粗、捕獲不多、現將銅鈞改細、將餌物置於鈎上、隨水運動、海魚疑為活物而呑之、故易上鈞而捕獲尚有流網、長凡數里但以每為漁輪所擾故不甚實用現已逐見减少、尚有大對船、卽同時有二艘船同行出發、一為網船、一為煨船、網船上裝置捕魚之鈎網、煨船上則專事煮飯菜之用、到海中二船並行前進、將鈎網拖延入海、此種漁船猶如新式之手操網船功效極佳、而成本較輕、尚有張網漁業、因其網孔甚密、將小魚均捕入在內、對於魚類繁殖、殊有影響、似應加以限制、</p>
<p>漁民生活應迅改善</p>
<p>關於漁民生活、實應迅謀改善、其迷信之重及衛生之不講究、使漁民往往妄送生命、同時烟酒由賭之風甚熾年來若干處、雖嚴禁烟賭、但酒色之事其風更甚、故今後一方面應舉辦與漁民有密切關係之特殊敎育、同時舉辦各種正當娛樂、</p>
<p>重利剝削亟予糾正</p>
<p>漁民所受種種剝削、如非親蒞其地、實難知其詳當魚汛時期、漁民忙於捕魚、捕得之魚、旣不能久存、－聽一般冰鮮魚船、任意作價收買、而冰鮮魚船又須轉賣於魚行、魚行再行轉裝其他各處出賣、如此轉輾買賣、漁民當難求善價、但漁民每於魚汛之前須購辦各種捕魚工具、或不在魚汛時期、為維持生活、均將借貸其最少者、亦須二分利息以上、多者達六七分之巨、以致漁民生活日趨窶窘、此實應迅謀救濟者也、</p>
<p>急須舉辨合作事業</p>
<p>救濟之法、以舉辦各種合作事業為目前急務舉凡消費運銷、信用等合作事業均應切實進行、現雖在各處設有合作指導員及漁業指導員、但尚未普遍、將來漁業貸欵團、能撥借巨欵則進行較易、而漁民得惠、更非淺鮮矣、</p>

<p>袁祥清乘機</p>
<p>於是日午後一時許、潛至曾孫氏房中、將該氏强迫姦污、至十日曾保珊回家、見該氏哭泣不已、詢悉前情、負氣外出、該氏卽於是晚羞忿以剃頭刀抹頸自殺、曾保珊返家見狀、卽送濟羣醫院、診治無效身死、經警局將袁拘</p>
<p>解地方法院</p>
<p>並由檢察官雷彬章蒞場騐明、訊據袁祥德供認與該氏有姦、惟喪心病狂、竟認為和姦、並稱在去年廢歷八月、卽與有染、當訊其姦宿次數、則稱自上年廢歷八月起至本年三月八日止前後不過三次、法官以該犯</p>
<p>為曾家僱工</p>
<p>、長住冰廠果有姦情、因利乘便、事極易就五月之久、何止僅姦三次姦情雖密事久不免外露、豈有如此情形、故又訊據同廠工人壟根生供、稱曾孫氏向來很規矩的、沒有人說她閑話、故法官論定孫氏平日並無苟且行為、故一經被污、</p>
<p>卽含憤自殺、而檢蔡官於偵查明確公訴書中群論云、倘非然者、本月八日其夫並不在家、家中祇該氏一人、袁祥清為其僱工、出入亦無猜嫌、續姦之後、無人知悉、袁祥清旣不得自行宣露、該氏更可深自掩飾、豈肯見夫哭訴、托詞强姦、以洩隱情、且袁祥清於本月八日姦污曾孫氏、已據供認所辯者强與和耳、據稱是日該氏要</p>
<p>與該犯睡覺</p>
<p>、該犯不肯、又稱氏要與其睏、故就睡了、女拒男姦、事所嘗有、女强男姦、事所罕見、旣已不肯、又復同睡、所供已不近情、假令果如所云、則曾孫氏無恥已甚、無恥之婦、何所不至、又何至以死自明、顯係該犯於事發之后、避重就輕、諱强言和、生而强姦、誣及死後、尤覺可惡、該犯實犯刑法第二百廿一條</p>
<p>第一項强姦</p>
<p>罪、（應處七年之罪）及第二百廿六條第二項之罪、（使被姦人含羞自殺處無期徒刑或七年以上之徒刑）向刑庭提起公訴、請為重辦、昨日由白洞嶺推事開庭、被告延龔楚吟律師、仍以和姦為辯、宮因以下問答有關風化、禁止旁聽、而其結果、改期再訊、被告還押、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>暴屍何多</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>“朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨”這是唐朝的大詩人描寫當時社會的一幅圖景，雖然只有“十個字”，然而把當時社會的主要癥結所在却完全暴露出來了！這正跟現在一邊把大量的咖啡麥丟在海里，一邊却有成千萬的飢餓者嗚咽吞泣在號寒的情景，有點相彷。當然，後者的情景，是比前者來得更加的悽厲了。</p>
<p>最近上海工部局衛生處發表一個“極堪注意的消息：蓋經衛生處紀錄，二月份租界內華人死亡人數一千三百名中，其間暴露屍體，竟佔六百二十六具，居百分之四十八。至死亡之主要原因，為癆病，心病，肺炎，傷寒，腦充血，……</p>
<p>上海在形式上講起來，誰說不是富麗堂皇？鄉下人，渴望到上海來，認為上海是“金地”，吃用不完的地方，因此如怒潮般的，從破產了的農村裏，汹湧而來。</p>
<p>然而，來了之後怎樣呢？</p>
<p>現實所給予他們的，是跟在鄉下時听想像的完全相反的情景，於是只好倒斃路上，做一名“野鬼”。</p>
<p>當然，我所說的“野鬼，不盡是從鄉下出來的“鄉下佬”，可是，在那六百二十六具的暴露屍體當中，對於上海懷有熱望的“鄉下佬”怕不見得會沒有吧？總會在那個數字中佔到比較的數目的吧！</p>
<p>可是不管死亡者的是“鄉下佬或是“上海佬”在那死亡的主要原因中，我們可以看出那些死亡者的生前，是為了一碗飯，在跟環境顯示出多麼猙獰的爭扎啊！然而總不免生癆病，心病，肺炎，傷寒，腦充血等可以醫治得好，然而為了貧窮也只得“管他娘的疾病，而倒斃在繁華的上海街頭，作一名可憐的暴露屍體！</p>
<p>上海是繁華的，是東方的巴黎！然而在他的內部，却是痨病，心病，肺炎，傷寒，脑充血等疾病的惡菌在腐爛着，上海的形骸呵！</p>
<h3>大明湖上</h3>
<p>— 馬蜂</p>
<p>正是太陽往西邊落下去的時候，又正巧是夏天，大明湖更顯得美麗，蘆葦到處叢生着，把人底眼睛蒙遮住了，牠的初次見面的朋友會以為——</p>
<p>“大明湖眞的不小呢，這不是望不着邊嗎！劉鐵雲在老殘遊記上說的這湖佔了半個城一點也不假呢。”</p>
<p>池塘裏不知誰家種的荷花，荷葉，蓮蓬，把水面都佈滿了。荷花底香氣在空氣裏飄盪着，使人站在那裏就不願動彈了。柳樹在對面的岸上很整齋地，生長着，頭低垂得可以碰到水面了。古老的城牆沒生氣的坐落很遠的對面。</p>
<p>我們走近停船的碼頭時，玩船的就圍上來了：</p>
<p>“去逛一下嗎？逛全湖好不好？這時候湖裏挺凉快的！”</p>
<p>我們不答腔，像閒逛着似的在碼頭上走，玩船的却釘跟在後邊，重複地說着兜拉生意的話。問他，逛全湖要多少錢？</p>
<p>玩船的這可更來了精神｜指手畫脚的說：</p>
<p>“先生，你說便宜不便宜——一塊五毛錢，三個人，逛全湖：鐵公祠，歷下亭，北極廟，張公祠全去！”</p>
<p>“去你的吧！你要價要的一點譜也沒有！”</p>
<p>一聽這話，玩船的自動地退落價錢——一塊錢。可是我們只出六角，在回轉身來走的時候，八角錢講好了生意•來搖船的卻是一個老頭子。我們很奇怪——怎末那個小夥子不來，玩船的答腔了：</p>
<p>“先生，雖然是他同你講的價，可是該我的班了，就得我來幹！生意清不這樣淺就的沒錢掙；才訂出來這種規矩！唉，不是生意清，八毛錢怎末能逛得着全湖呢！”</p>
<p>他說着，篙打着水｜船離開湖岸走向湖中去了。我們一面吃着茶，一面觀望着四週景色；老船夫卻又拉開了話匣子，像是把受着苦難訴說一下，心裏會輕鬆些似地。</p>
<p>“生意清，年頭不對了，先生，你說是不是？”我們點點頭“這眞是一點也不錯！張宗昌在這裏的時候，那一天，不得見一二十塊錢！現在可就不成了，一天見一兩塊錢就得算是好生意了——沒生意是常有的事呢。先生們也許沒留意，西門大街，布政司大街，貢院牆根，我們派了很多人去等候生意呢！</p>
<p>聽了老船夫的話，記得在那些路上曾碰到有人問我：∣逛湖去嗎？”</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>到鵲華橋去的嗎？”“……”，我以為這是很謖的事情，人們坐車在那里走就是去逛大明湖的嗎？去逛湖的人，就看得出來嗎？我把這些話問老船夫—</p>
<p>……先生，雖然是看不出來，到這邊來的人不見得就是逛湖的，可是沒生意，有什麼好法子想！有人在街上打打招呼，可也總比沒人强。……去年敎育館里的先生們，說是為了把大明湖弄得熱鬧些，我們可以有生意，呌我們玩船的比賽一下，可是怎末呢？唉，不的！一瞎驢推磨，一圈一圈地轉∣｜照樣“唉，照樣的沒生意”！</p>
<p>船走到歷下亭了。我們下船去逛了一下，歷下亭在湖里邊是走運的一個地方，收拾得很漂亮，是為了名人們常到這里來宴請外來的名人的緣故。但是沒什麼讓人游覽的。</p>
<p>逛完北極廟，船撥向西邊的鐵公祠時，天已白黃昏轉變成黑暗了。四週底景色模糊起來，大上沒有月亮，也沒有星星，黑沉沉地，像要落雨。城頭馬路中的路燈，發着　發的電　　　　精神也沒　　　　　　　，　　　　　　　　　　　　　的中間走着。時刻地在蘆葦叢里看到亮晶晶地的東西，並且是流動的，—把月夜的大明湖繪畫得更美麗了。</p>
<p>“這是什麼？”</p>
<p>我也很驚奇，晚上逛大明湖我還是第一次，—蘆葦叢里，有很多的這種東西在飛舞着呢。老船家告訴我們了—</p>
<p>“螢火虫”。</p>
<p>“螢火虫”！</p>
<p>我們重了一句。“噯！這太美了”！</p>
<p>船棚上的洋錢片，發出了很輕很慢地聲響——，是雨落起來了。</p>
<h3>妻夜書</h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>春天已經過去一大半了，夜是悶熱而煩燥的。風吹着失去了田園氣息的街樹，沙抄地搖曳作響。烏黑的半空中飄來三兩聲鴣鴣的夜啼，凄涼，荒寂，有如日落時分的幾聲遠寺的鐘聲：從牠，人感覺到了宇宙間的無邊的廣大與永恒，自我生命與智慧之渺小可憐。</p>
<p>孤寂地處在那些絕望的地域中，離開一世彷稀有千萬里的遙遠的孤獨—孤　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　情　　　　　　燥與不安，人彷彿永遠是在急切地期待一些什麼，而這些又都是悠遠，渺茫，模糊，而不可捉摸的，年月的重量沈壓在人底身體上；於是，在荒遠的睡夢中也許會看見一些當年的容顏（祇有在這時候，歲月的暗影才稍稍地减去了牠底一點重量！）於是，醒來了——醒來依然是深沈的黑夜，發現自己在一分一秒間老了十年或二十年，生活中的被侮辱與被損害的污痕，猶如照像紙在暗紅燈光下的顯影藥液中，慢慢地，從灰白而朦朧，從朦朧而清楚深刻，終乃成為顯明的一幅圖畫——永遠也磨擦不掉的一幅圖了。</p>
<p>這種歲月蝕盡了人性的悲歡，於此，你是也許有相同的經騐與感受的吧？但，所能咎責於我的，就僅僅是我的無能凄夜醇濃如甘美的酖酒，這些時生活於我是酷慘的，不僅為了沒有人還能約路地記得我，甚且，我更沒有那種福分可以紀念人家，於是一日一日的，我彷彿夢遊人之獨步於夜之樺林裏，在這引醇濃的凄寂的深更，我需要暢暢地透出我底窒息的呼吸，我需要看見與自己同類的生命，我需要看見能够回答我底歡笑，憂泣，熱愛，與憤悵的“人”，我終至在內心起了愈作愈厲的擾亂與焦燥，彷彿一頭猛獸被囚困在籠裏，呌人把大自然的心胸隔離在鐵橺中，也像激流的噴泉（我看過激流的噴泉，而且是多麼神往那沸騰的雄姿喲！）不絕地傾瀉在平靜的死水中，終於，甚至那死水也不能再維持牠底本身的沈靜，而激動得泛着點點的泡沫，竟至也許要沸腾起來了•我想那死水是苦惱着的———因為，牠是受了感動，也受了擾亂。</p>
<p>你咎責我底無能吧——因為，我記憶起來了；酷慘得不能使人相信的生活使我埋首去咬緊我自己底齒牙，而我，我，是也具有一切人類的先天的要求的，我要求生活下去——因為我也是一個“人”呀，而生活，難道你便以為是一種罪惡嗎？——而一個個凄絕的夜，焚煎着人底內心，使我不敢再去預計這種日子還會延常到多久了。慢慢地，一個人就變得太與自己親近起來，大信任它，太把它看得祟高與偉大了。於是，在無盡的凄夜中，我拋棄了叔本華，而拿起尼采來了。瘋狂地吞食牠們，一種崇高的自我堅强的火花閃燦在頁與頁之間。我乃為之傾倒了——然而，我依舊是寂寞的；我祇希望烏黑的天空祇要有一點點星亮，或曠野外祇要有一兩絲細微的人聲（且不說要窗外有明輝的太陽吧！），我立刻會把尼采遠遠地拋去，而趕向風聲　　　的田野　去向星星，向渺茫的</p>
<p>於是，正如死泉，被擾亂了之後，也慢慢地自己泛起微弱水花來了。我諦聽着，諦聽着，烏黑的天空，一兩點微一弱的星星闪耀着如带光的灰座；遠處，彷彿有如夢中細語一樣的人聲。我燃燒，喜悅，且甚至感激，正如那星星，那人語，都是專誠來撫治我底凄寂的傷創一樣；我狂奔到破殘的門檻邊，把門大大地打開。然而！外面是那麼烏黑！我茫然了……</p>
<p>為什麼要那麼說呢——是的，那麼說，幾乎便是無恥的了•可咎責的就祇是我底無能，狐狸終究是狐狸呀！</p>
<p>但，我也到底把尼采遠遠地拋去了——不是為了看輕他，倒是，為了怕把他污蔑！</p>
<p>我再不說什麼了。星星如射箭似地霎時遠去，凄夜中，人語聲飄走着如詩，如昇華的夢，然而，從這夢中，我自己照見了自己。</p>
<p>是個惡夢哪！</p>

After briefly having tea and refreshments, he proceeded to the Provincial Government for inspection and visited the tomb of Han Xuan. He then went directly to Zhongshan Road, crossed the river to Lushan Mountain for sightseeing, first visiting Yunlu Palace, then the tomb of Huang Xing. Together with National Government Committee Member Zhou Zhenlin, he paid respects and laid wreaths, with Huang Yiou returning the salute.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Convenes Meeting to Discuss Tax Exemption for Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Reconsidering Rice Supply to Guangdong; Hong Kong Rice Merchants Call on Wu Tiegcheng with Two Requests</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The tax exemption for imported foreign rice in Guangdong Province has prompted rice merchants and provincial chairmen from Hunan, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang provinces to petition the Ministry of Finance to withdraw its order. On the afternoon of the 13th, the Ministry of Finance convened a meeting with representatives from the Ministry of Industry. Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Division of the Ministry of Finance, and Xu Tinghu, Director of the Agricultural Division of the Ministry of Industry, attended. The issue of rice supply to Guangdong Province was reconsidered, and the results will soon be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Wu Tiegcheng summoned Hong Kong rice merchants at 9:30 AM on the 13th. The rice merchants made two requests: first, that foreign rice be exempt from import tax when entering Guangdong, without the need for licenses, with customs responsible for handling matters to avoid delays; second, that the government approve the tax exemption for foreign rice entering Guangdong from April 1st to August 31st, but since the new domestic grain will be on the market in July and August, they requested that the tax exemption period be shortened to April 1st to June 30th. Wu promised to carefully consider the matter after entering Guangdong. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Provincial Government received a reply from the Ministry of Finance regarding the tax-exempt import registration of foreign rice and grain, stating that the previous method of half-tax record-keeping for foreign rice will still be followed. Merchants transporting foreign grain and rice can import it at any time, with direct registration by customs for simplicity and to ensure food supply. (13th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Kodama's Appointment as Envoy to China Unlikely</h3>
<p>—Kato's Statement—</p>
<p>[Beiping] Kato stated that the rumor of Kenji Kodama being appointed as ambassador to China is unlikely to become a reality. Chen Zhongfu is scheduled to go to Japan on the 14th to investigate industry. As for the fact that four important figures from Hebei and Chahar will also go to Japan for investigation, he has not heard of it. The Japanese Embassy in Beiping has recently added one counselor, Mitoru Miyajima, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who is expected to arrive in Beiping in early May. Japanese and Korean people are privately smuggling copper coins out of the country, mostly through coastal areas. The police station discovered this matter some time ago, but there has been no news of it recently. Nakane, the Japanese consul in Zhangjiakou, went to Tianjin to discuss important matters and will return to Beiping from Zhangjiakou on the 15th.

<h3>Closing Arguments in Wang Jingwei Assassination Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>Morning and Afternoon Court Sessions to Continue Hearing Yu Likui and Others; Verdict Scheduled for 4:00 PM on the 19th</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Capital District Court held court yesterday morning and afternoon to continue hearing the case of Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, and ten others for the crimes of assassinating Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen and disrupting order. The courtroom was still crowded with onlookers. The court officially began closing arguments in the morning, which concluded in the afternoon. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 4:00 PM on the 19th. The closing arguments were exceptionally精彩. At 9:00 AM, Judge Gao Weijun, magistrates Deng Binxun and Li Wenwei, prosecutor Zhang Weidong, clerk Tu Huaili, and others took the stand. Defense attorneys Wang Long, Chen Pandong, Fu Kuanglin, Zhu Qichao, and others, totaling thirteen, also attended on time. After the court convened, the judge read Yu Likui, Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, Hu Changping, Zhang Guoping, Xu Yaoying, Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi, the twelve defendants, and informed them of the court records from the 12th, which would be read again after the closing arguments concluded. He then asked if the defendants had any new facts to present. Subsequently, the defendants made statements to the court, the content of which was not significantly different from the court hearing on the 12th. The judge then announced the start of closing arguments, first inviting prosecutor Zhang to present his case. Zhang stated that the fact that the twelve defendants participated in a society with the purpose of committing crimes was extremely clear. Zhang Yuhua, He Poguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, Lu Qingqi, Yu Likui, Zhou Shiping, and Hu Dahai all jointly participated in the plot to assassinate Wang Jingwei and committed murder. In addition, Yu Likui went to Hunan to agitate the military and committed the crime of inciting soldiers to disobey discipline. Directing the assassination of Song Ziwen was also a murder crime. He asked the judge to make a judgment according to the law. However, he added that at a time when internal and external troubles were pressing, the judge should consider whether the defendants' criminal psychology was caused by unclear measures taken by the authorities and whether there were mitigating circumstances. According to prosecutor Zhang's statement, he added additional charges against Zhou Shiping, Hu Dahai, and several others. After the statement, the judge first questioned Yu Likui, who stated that (1) the Morning Light Society assassination had nothing to do with him, which can be proven by Zhang Yuhua's testimony. Since he did not participate in the Morning Light Society's group activities, he was not responsible for the assassination of Wang Jingwei. (2) The assassination of Song Ziwen was a false accusation by witness Wang Renshan. On the day of the incident, he was definitely in Guangzhou, as evidenced by the bill from the Yue Dong Asia Hotel and the testimony of the staff. (3) He went to Hunan at a time when the People's Government had been abolished for two years. The prosecutor's failure to pay attention to the timing when changing the charges to inciting the military to the People's Government. Next, Yu's defense attorneys, Liu Bochang and Wang Long, defended him based on legal facts, asking the court to declare Yu not guilty. Next, Hu Dahai was questioned. Hu only stated that he hoped the court would consider that witness Wang Renshan's testimony was unreliable. Hu's defense attorney, Zhu Qichao, defended Hu, saying that Hu was a cook, and the court could order him to cook as a test. Moreover, Hu was serving a person and was entrusted by his master to send a briefcase to another house, which was the most common thing and could not be simply judged as participating in the conspiracy because the contents of the box were criminal evidence. Next, Zhou Shiping was questioned. He stated that he had never met Wang Renshan and did not know who he was. The witness testimony against him was unreliable. Zhou's defense attorney, Wang Zanming, also did his best to defend him. By this point, it was noon, and the debate was adjourned to continue in the afternoon. (13th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Returning Russian Ambassador to Japan Issues a Statement</h3>
<p>Preparing to Negotiate Pending Issues</p>
<p>⊙Tsuruga Soviet Ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, has returned to Japan for his post. He arrived in Tsuruga at 7:00 AM on the 13th aboard the Siberia Maru and transferred to an international train eastward at 9:00 AM. On board the ship, he made the following remarks regarding the issues facing Japan and the Soviet Union:</p>
<p>When I was still returning to the country, Japan already had a dedicated foreign minister appointed. Therefore, after returning to my post, I intend to visit Foreign Minister Sato and exchange various opinions on the issues of Japanese-Soviet relations during the meeting. Regarding the border issue, I have previously proposed concluding a non-aggression treaty, so I will not have any further active proposals after that. However, if the Japanese side has any opinions, I am prepared to give them full consideration. Regarding the abolition of the Vladivostok merchant shipping group, I have not heard of it, but the Soviet Union will naturally give due consideration to Japan's rights and interests. Regarding the future of Japanese-Soviet trade relations, it generally seems pessimistic. However, in my opinion, this may be because the so-called intermediary trade was too prosperous during the time of purchasing the North Railway's material payments. Now that this prosperous period has passed, it is inevitable that it will turn into a period of silence. As for how it will develop in the future, it is impossible to predict, but it will not ultimately lead to a complete cessation of trade. It is said that Soviet Trade Representative to Japan, Gashetov, will soon take a temporary leave of absence to return home, and something may emerge to break the deadlock when he returns.

<h3>U.S. Treasury Secretary Denies Changing Dollar Value</h3>
<p>Oliphant Talks About France's Economic Situation</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding rumors of a further devaluation of the dollar, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently gave a statement to reporters, denying them, saying, "We have no intention of doing so, and we need not feel uneasy about the possible impact of continued foreign gold inflows into the United States." (12th Central News Agency, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] The *Financial News* published a statement by French Finance Minister Oliphant to the newspaper's reporters, stating, "I still believe that if the currencies of the major countries can be stabilized simultaneously as soon as possible, all instability in the monetary system can be ended, which will greatly benefit the world's economic recovery." The various pressures on the franc's position no longer exist, so he does not intend to adopt exchange restrictions... "Our country originally had two paths to follow, one is to manage exchange rates, and the other is to cooperate with other major countries to maintain exchange rate freedom. Our country now chooses the second method," adding that the French monetary law stipulated the highest and lowest limits for the gold content of the franc (originally, each franc contained 0.0655 grams of 90% gold, which was later changed to between 0.0049 grams and 0.043 grams after devaluation). The French government will now allow the franc to obtain natural equalization between these two limits. Oliphant later recounted that France's economic situation is very smooth, as evidenced by the recent national defense bonds (totaling 10,500,000,000 francs), whose issuance was exceptionally successful, with most subscriptions coming from private investors. Regarding the possibility of continued capital inflows into France, he said, "French public bonds and various securities still have considerable room for appreciation, so foreign capital and French capital deposited abroad can still be attracted and continue to flow in." Regarding the high interest rates on loans in France, he said that once prices are stabilized, loan interest rates can be reduced... Finally, regarding the 1937 budget, he said that the deficit is currently estimated at 4,800,000,000 francs, but in recent months, the national treasury's revenue has increased significantly, so the deficit is expected to be greatly reduced.

<h3>Hull's Declaration at the Textile Conference</h3>

Secretary of State Hull recently gave a statement at the conference, saying that the tariff barriers erected by most countries, which are discriminatory, must be changed. He said that if a lasting peace and the revival of the world economy are to be achieved, it must be done through cooperation between countries and groups with common economic goals.

<h3>U.S. Auto King Ford Faces Possible Prison Sentence</h3>
<p>[Washington] After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled yesterday that the Wagner Labor Relations Act does not violate the Constitution, it is said that auto magnate Ford may face imprisonment because Ford recently stated that he does not recognize the right of unions to collective bargaining, and this law stipulates that any employer who refuses to engage in collective bargaining with the legitimate representatives of employees shall be sentenced to imprisonment. It is rumored that before Ford made his remarks rejecting collective bargaining last week, he consulted with legal counsel, who advised that the court could not consider the publication of such remarks a violation of the Wagner Act.

<h3>Countries Generally Agree to Abolish Egypt's Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Britain and France Advocate Establishing Transitional Measures. China Also Sends Personnel to Attend as Observers</p>
<p>⊙Montreux The conference on the abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt opened here yesterday and has now ended, with a subcommittee starting to handle the various issues. The key points of the negotiations are three: (1) the length of the transition period, (2) the proposal to use a majority of Egyptian judges in the mixed courts, (3) the proposal to immediately abolish the right of foreigners to be exempt from taxes. (12th Central News Agency, Reuters)</p>
<p>⊙Montreux It is heard that the transition period will be set at eighteen years, which is the same as the length of time that British troops are stationed in Egypt. (13th Central News Agency, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙Montreux The conference on extraterritoriality in Egypt continued here at 10:00 AM this morning. Representatives of the twelve countries and British autonomous territories that enjoy extraterritoriality in Egypt expressed sympathy for Egypt's proposal to abolish this extraterritoriality. However, representatives from Britain, Belgium, France, and Norway requested that Egypt must guarantee that the expatriates of various countries can continue to live and work in Egypt without discrimination. U.S. Representative Fishy declared that, based on President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy, the United States welcomes Egypt's efforts to abolish extraterritoriality. The United States will not consider protecting its own interests at this conference, but intends to consider the interests of Egypt and all related countries. (13th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>⊙Montreux Major Wallace, the British representative, also spoke on behalf of Australia, New Zealand, and India, saying that the British government fully supports the abolition of consular jurisdiction. This attitude was clearly expressed when the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was signed. The Egyptian government should enjoy the same rights to deal with foreigners as other independent countries. However, if this goal is achieved immediately, foreigners will suddenly encounter fundamentally different circumstances, which is unfair. Therefore, it must be implemented gradually to give foreigners time and opportunities to adapt to the new situation. The natural solution is to establish a transitional system. The length of the period depends on the decision of this conference. He went on to say that Britain supports shortening the transition period as much as possible. The principle of the British proposal is that all consular jurisdiction should be abolished immediately, and mixed courts should be established during the transition period. Cases previously under the jurisdiction of consular courts should be assigned to mixed courts for trial. Britain believes that the Egyptian government should ensure that the interests of foreigners are respected. Count Malascorti, the Italian representative, said that Italian-Egyptian relations have always been cordial and hoped that this friendly relationship would continue on behalf of the Italian expatriates in Egypt. Deschanel, the French representative, stated the friendly relationship between France and Egypt, declaring that the French government hopes that Egypt will obtain complete sovereignty, but believes that a transitional period is necessary. The French government hopes that French people will enjoy equal treatment with people from other countries in the future, and France has unlimited confidence in Egyptian democracy. Representatives from Portugal, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Ireland, and Southwest Africa all expressed sympathy for Egypt, hoping that the issue of consular jurisdiction would be satisfactorily resolved.

<p>⊙Montreux The Montreux Conference opened this afternoon. In his welcome speech, the President of the Swiss Confederation pointed out that Switzerland was one of the first countries to invite Egypt to join the League of Nations, and then said that Egypt has been requesting revisions to the laws concerning the relationship between Egypt and foreigners since the sixteenth century, in other words, requesting the abolition of consular jurisdiction, which is very normal. (12th National Haitong Telegraph) ⊙Montreux The international conference on the issue of Egypt's abolition of consular jurisdiction opened here this afternoon. At the suggestion of the French Chief Representative, 特德桑 (Tedesco), a member of the Council of State, the conference unanimously elected Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas as chairman. Nahas immediately issued a declaration, forcefully stating that the consular jurisdiction system is no longer compatible with Egypt's national dignity and is also contrary to the tasks that Egypt will undertake in the community of civilized nations in the future. Therefore, two things must be done at present: (1) abolish the tax exemption rights that foreigners currently enjoy in Egypt, (2) gradually abolish the mixed courts that hear cases involving foreigners. In conclusion, he said that Egypt has always embraced a spirit of freedom and generosity, so once the consular jurisdiction system is abolished, foreigners in Egypt will certainly be able to develop their material, spiritual, and cultural interests under Egyptian sovereignty. Then, the conference decided to establish two committees, one is the General Committee, responsible for drafting general regulations on the issue of abolishing consular jurisdiction, chaired by the famous jurist, the Greek Ambassador to France, 立狄斯 (Litis), and the other is the Committee for the Study of the Organization of the Mixed Courts during the transitional period, chaired by the Danish representative, Hansen. The conference is now scheduled to reconvene at 10:00 AM tomorrow. (12th Central News Agency, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙Montreux Since China still practices consular jurisdiction domestically, it is very concerned about the Montreux conference discussing the abolition of Egyptian consular jurisdiction. The Chinese Embassy in Switzerland has specially sent Wang Yanxi, First Secretary, to attend the meeting, but has not requested formal recognition, only attending as an observer in a private capacity.

<h3>The Lin Cabinet's New Policies Seek Concrete Implementation</h3>
<p>Separately Prioritizing and Drafting Bills, Special Parliament to be Convened in July</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government recently announced eight major policies in order to achieve innovative policies in a special parliament. Prime Minister Lin, taking into account various factors, decided to convene a special parliament in July, with a session of about ten days. According to the Prime Minister's opinion, since the government has decided on innovative policies, it should seek their concretization as soon as possible within the possible scope, and compile these policies into bills in preparation for submitting them to the parliament. According to the government's current parliamentary strategy, it will avoid submitting a large number of bills in a short period of time, and will consider the urgency, importance, and possibility of passing each article of the eight major policies, and decide on the method of submission. Therefore, bills such as the electricity control bill and the extension of compulsory education bill, which require a long time to deliberate, will be submitted to the ordinary parliament for deliberation. In the next three months, it will steadily carry out the concretization of the Lin Cabinet's policies and prepare to resubmit the Agricultural Land Act, the National Health Insurance Act, the Military Secrets Protection Act, and the Imperial Fuel Industry Corporation Act, which were not established in the 70th parliament. (13th Domei News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Cabinet held a meeting at 10:20 AM on the 13th to discuss which of the eight major items of the new policies decided on the 10th should be started. As a result, the following policy was decided: (1) National Policy Integration Organization (Planning Agency), (2) Establishment of a deliberative body on the thoroughness of the national essence concept and the refreshing of the national spirit, (3) Refreshing of first-line administrative affairs, etc. These three policies will be concretized as soon as possible without waiting for the convening of a special parliament.</p>
<p>Regarding the Planning Agency proposal, the main points have already been decided by the two heads, Oohashi and Kawagoe. The necessary expenses will be paid from the second reserve fund. In view of the importance of this agency, it has been decided to realize it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the deliberative council for the refreshing of literature and education, the current cabinet has the greatest mission of expressing the true appearance of the national essence, so it is also necessary to promote its realization quickly. The expenses will also be paid from the second reserve fund, and the Chief Secretary and the Director-General of the Legislation Bureau are ordered to quickly draft concrete original plans.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the refreshing of first-line administrative affairs, each cabinet member will order each ministry to investigate the actual situation of affairs and promote its concretization. At the regular vice-ministerial meetings every week, each ministry will also establish contact with each other. As for the bills to be submitted to the special parliament, no decision has been made today, and the Cabinet will continue to study them in the future. The meeting adjourned at noon.

<h3>Japanese Government Controls Industry</h3>
<p>Strengthening the Industrial Rationalization Bureau</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The work of industrial rationalization has always been handled by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry as a temporary facility. Now, in view of the importance of this work, the government has decided to rename it the Control Bureau, make it a standing organization, and strengthen it. The Cabinet meeting on the 13th passed the draft amendment to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry's official system and completed the consultation procedures with the Privy Council.</p>
<p>The content of the official system reform案 is to abolish the current Industrial Rationalization Bureau, which is an external bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and rename it the Control Bureau, making it an internal bureau of the ministry. At the same time, it will be changed to a two-department system, divided into the Control, Rationalization, and Finance divisions. The duties of the Control Division are to implement the Important Industries Control Act and to oversee the Important Fertilizer Industry Act. The duties of the Rationalization Division are to implement the scientific management methods of enterprises, in other words, methods of increasing industrial efficiency such as simplification and standardization of commodities. The duties of the Finance Division are mainly to provide loans to small and medium-sized industrialists, in other words, the affairs of the Central Cooperative Bank for Commerce and Industry, as well as guarantees for losses incurred by national treasury loans and prefectural relending to small and medium-sized merchants and industrialists, in other words, the guarantee work for prefectural local bonds. It is expected to be implemented from May 1 after the Privy Council passes it. (13th Domei News)</p>
<h3>Japan's Political Warfare Intensifies</h3>
<p>Parties' Presumed Candidates Begin Nationwide Campaigning Immediately</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Political warfare has entered its second phase. According to precedent, all candidates should have been nominated and each faction should have begun its verbal battles. However, this general election lacks such momentum. Both the Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties have been struggling to finalize their officially recognized candidates, gradually approaching last year's total number of participants. A total of 40 additional candidates were announced on the 12th alone, but this is still 70 fewer than last year. Therefore, both parties have fewer candidates this year than last. The Seiyūkai, which started later, suddenly surged on the 12th, exceeding the Minseitō by 20 candidates in one fell swoop. With this, both major parties have now nominated all their candidates. As the two parties embark on their nationwide campaigns, political warfare is about to enter a truly heated phase. However, as of now, in the fourth district of Niigata Prefecture, not a single candidate has emerged. Furthermore, the first district of Niigata Prefecture, the second district of Saga Prefecture, the first district of Nagano Prefecture, and the fourth district of Fukuoka Prefecture have not yet reached the legally required number of candidates. The entire nation remains indifferent. This is a major characteristic of this general election. Observers generally interpret this as a silent protest by the general public against the government's dissolution of the Diet. (13th, Dōmei News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Central League for Clean Elections, along with various organizations such as the Tokyo Prefecture, the Tokyo City, and the Metropolitan Police Department, jointly held a large-scale lecture on clean elections at Hibiya Public Hall at 1:00 PM on the 13th. By 11:00 AM that morning, over 500 citizens were already lined up in front of the venue waiting for the doors to open. By the time the meeting started, the hall was packed with listeners, with almost no room to stand. After the opening announcement by Fujioka, the Director-General of Tokyo Prefecture, everyone sang the national anthem. The Governor of Tokyo Prefecture recited the Imperial Rescript on the promulgation of the Constitution. Next, Prime Minister Hayashi, Interior Minister Kawaharada, Chief Prosecutor Izumi, League Chairman Tazawa, Tokyo Mayor Ushizuka, and others successively took the stage to speak, emphasizing the importance of elections and the necessity of holding fair elections. After the speeches, everyone shouted "Banzai" three times, and a sound film about elections was shown until the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. (13th, Dōmei News)</p>

<h3>Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui Organize National Rice Sales to Guangdong Inspection Team</h3>
<p>Tax-Free Import of Foreign Rice Leads to Grain Surplus: On-site Inspection in Guangdong to Regulate Production and Sales</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Guangdong Province is firmly requesting the Central Government to allow the tax-free import of foreign rice. Consequently, rice merchants from the Guangchao region stationed in Wuhu dare not freely collect and transport rice, fearing a loss of their capital. The source of rice in Guangdong Province has temporarily decreased, and the public is increasingly worried about food shortages. Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces are facing a rice surplus. The rice market has stagnated, and prices have fallen accordingly. Currently, the price of ordinary rice has dropped to around eight yuan per stone (unit of dry measure), significantly impacting the rural economy. Anhui Province's unique specialty is rice. The province's prosperity depends on the rice market. Regarding the transport of Anhui rice, Guangchao is the largest market besides Yantai and Tianjin. In the past, when transportation was inconvenient, if Guangdong Province faced rice shortages, only Anhui rice was shipped from Wuhu, reaching as much as eight million old bushels in a year. The amount shipped from Hunan and Jiangxi provinces was not included. Now, Guangdong Province is only short of about three million bushels of rice, and it does not seem necessary to import foreign rice to feed the people. Therefore, Anhui merchants believe that the market has been severely affected by the stagnation of the rice market, and it is necessary to work together to save the local financial and rural economy. The Wuhu Chamber of Commerce has launched an initiative to organize a National Rice Transportation and Sales Inspection Team from Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces. In addition to telegraphing the Nanchang and Changsha Chambers of Commerce to seek their agreement and request them to nominate representatives to join the team, they have also petitioned the governments of the three provinces to send personnel to participate and assist, under the leadership of the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, to jointly conduct an on-site inspection in Guangdong. This matter concerns the vital interests of the three provinces. It is expected that this organization will be established and travel in the shortest possible time. The Wuhu Chamber of Commerce's telegram to the Jiangxi and Hunan Chambers of Commerce reads as follows: "To the Chambers of Commerce of Nanchang and Changsha: Recently, due to the tax-free import of foreign rice in Guangdong Province, the rice-producing areas of our Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces deeply believe that the rice surplus will affect the rural areas. Collective petitions have been made. However, Guangdong Province claims that the lack of food for the people is a last resort. Therefore, there is a sense of parochialism. Is it not the same as abandoning one's own field to cultivate another's field? And it is not the original intention of the central government to regulate food for the people and rescue the rural areas. Our chamber believes that to ensure that there is no shortage or surplus of domestic food, there must be a true investigation before there can be appropriate measures. We plan to have each of the rice-producing areas in our three provinces nominate one or two representatives to form a National Rice Transportation and Sales Inspection Team. On the one hand, each representative will petition the provincial government to send personnel to assist, and on the other hand, telegraph the Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau of the Ministry of Finance to lead the team to Guangdong Province for on-site inspection. Not only can the current dispute be resolved, but also future statistics on domestic food can reduce the risk of misunderstanding. If your chamber agrees, please reply by telegram to determine the travel date. The Wuhu Chamber of Commerce." (11th)</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui Discusses the Current Situation in Xikang (Continued)</h3>
<p>Devastated After the Red Bandits' Incursion, Gradually Restoring to Its Original State Through Continuous Reorganization</p>
<p>Pleased to Surrender</p>
<p>Liu also stated that representatives from counties such as Cai, Kanbu, Maqing, Wengzhan, Huazong, Baoduo, Guwai, and Jiakang North Women's Secretary Dedqin, Wangmu Dege Secretary Zewangdengdeng, as well as Zeldao, the representative of Ganzi's Baili Secretary and Kangnan's Maole Tusi, and the Southern Route Grand Lamas Huozhu Xianggen, Losang, Jiangbo, Ganzi, Zhongsa Hutuktu Xianggen Hutuktu, Lühuo County Gecong Hutuktu, Kangding County Guwakha Temple Hutuktu, and Jiarong Geshi, successively arrived in Lücheng. After several meetings, they were very satisfied. They are all leaders of Xikang's political and religious affairs. Their words and actions have the power to influence the people of Xikang. They thoroughly understood the central government's kindness towards the people of Xikang and his mission in coming to the west. Therefore, they were all pleased and sincerely went to promote to the general public. Therefore, although the local society is poor, it is indeed very stable. Regarding the issue of the Tibetan army's withdrawal, he immediately telegraphed Suokang, the Eastern Commander-in-Chief of the Tibetan army stationed in Qamdo, accusing him of violating the agreement and invading. He hoped that he would withdraw the troops crossing the river back to their original defense. Our army also advanced to threaten. Seeing our firm attitude and thorough defense, Suokang sent a messenger, Duoji, to Kang to present everything on his behalf. After repeated guidance and explanation of justice, and ordering the forward troops to implement gradual suppression, the Tibetan army gradually withdrew completely in February of this year without spending a single soldier or bullet. Our army completely recovered the four counties of Nakodégé, Baiyu, and Shiqu, which it had previously occupied. The county magistrates of each county have also taken office to appease the local people. The people of Xikang are greatly delighted, and the hearts of the people are naturally more stable.</p>
<p>Panchen Returns to Tibet</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet, it has not yet been resolved smoothly. The Lhasa government still adopts a policy of welcoming in appearance but rejecting in reality. Previously, Zasha Suokang and Panchen Lama's representative Panchen Kanbu met at Qingke Temple in Dengke. Both sides requested him to send personnel to participate. He immediately appointed Staff Officer Luo Haikuan and Inspector Zheng Shaocheng to go, instructing them to strongly advocate that the Tibetan government should follow the central government's intention and welcome the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet. Now, although the Panchen Lama acknowledges that he will not pass through Qamdo and Lhasa and will enter the rear of Tibet through a side route, the Lhasa government still requires the Panchen Lama not to bring escorts or honor guards. Therefore, negotiations have been suspended again. He believes that the central government must promote the Panchen Lama's early return to Tibet to maintain its authority. Recently, the Panchen Lama sent his Secretary-General Liu Jiaju to Kang to discuss the methods of returning to Tibet. In addition to strictly following the central government's intention, he has no other prejudices. He sent Chief Advisor Xu Tiefeng to Yushu to thank him and express his consistent belief in Buddhism and his willingness to bear the responsibility of protecting the Dharma in Kang and Tibet. He expects that this issue will be resolved in the shortest possible time. The above are some of his experiences in Kang. Speaking of the promotion of administrative affairs after the Construction Committee moved to Kang, there are only the following facts:</p>
<p>Reduce and Exempt Taxes</p>
<p>The Kang area has suffered severe disasters. All land taxes and livestock taxes in the entire territory should be reduced and exempted to comfort the survivors. It is estimated that Danba, Daofu, Luhuo, Ganzi, and Kangding counties will be fully exempted from land and livestock taxes for the 25th year. Qianhua, Ba'an, Lihua, Baiyu, Dege, Huding, and Yajiang counties will be half-exempted from land and livestock taxes for the 25th year. Jiulong, Dengke, and Shiqu counties will each be exempted from three-tenths of land and livestock taxes for the 25th year. The total reduction and exemption is estimated to be over 7,776 stones of main grain and over 379 stones of lower grain.</p>
<p>Reduce and Exempt Tea Taxes</p>
<p>In recent years, Kang-Tibet disputes have disrupted transportation routes, and tea merchants have suffered significant losses. To show compassion for the merchants' difficulties, previous accumulated tickets of 1,428,429 yuan have been reduced and exempted, and 40,780 tea tax tickets (each ticket should pay one tael of tax silver) have been reduced and exempted. Compared to the amount of 110,000 tickets in the 15th year, the annual shortfall in legal tender is over 44,900 yuan. ㊂ Change the Lüguan Customs to a Local Tax Bureau to Implement a Unified Tax System. On December 1, 25th year, the Lüguan Customs Tax Collection Office was changed to the Xikang Provincial Local Tax Bureau. Inspection stations were established at the border with neighboring provinces and at important locations in the north and south. All previous Lüguan merchant protection fees, Yajiang boat donation bureau, and Jiulong miscellaneous donation bureau were abolished, and a unified tax system was strictly implemented. Import and export taxes were especially reduced to encourage the export of local goods.</p>
<p>Improve Ula</p>
<p>Ula is the only means of transportation in Xikang. It has been in use for a long time, and many malpractices have arisen. Not only do the people suffer, but the government also feels inconvenienced. Therefore, the Construction Committee convened a general assembly of all the people of Kang to discuss ways to improve the Ula system and revise the new regulations, which were announced for compliance. The Tangda service was abolished.</p>
<p>Run Training Classes</p>
<p>The Baojia Training Institute has been running courses for more than ten weeks and is about to graduate. In the future, after organizing the masses and breaking down the barriers of the local system, all government orders can penetrate into the people. Fifty county government personnel trainees have been recruited in Chengdu and have been taken to Kangding for training. The Volunteer Teacher Training Class is scheduled to start on April 2nd. The Statistics Personnel Training Class is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>Promote Legal Tender</p>
<p>There are no accurate statistics on the land situation, land tax situation, and livestock slaughter tax figures in the counties of Xikang. Various investigation forms have been formulated and ordered to be filled out and reported by the counties, and personnel have been sent to Guanwai to conduct on-site investigations. The currency system in Kangding is extremely complex. The Construction Committee has adopted a gradual approach to promote legal tender. In addition to all tax authorities uniformly collecting legal tender, it has also stipulated the exchange rate between Tibetan silver ingots and legal tender and prohibited the splitting of hard currency. Legal tender is gradually becoming popular in Kang. Due to the stagnant financial situation in the Kang area, merchants have long felt inconvenienced, and internal and external remittances take a long time. The Construction Committee has raised a fund and was approved by the central government in the middle of last month to establish a local bank. Equipment and business operations can be carried out this month. From then on, Xikang's finances can flow smoothly.</p>
<p>Rectify Local Troops</p>
<p>Due to the existence of local forces, it is difficult to thoroughly reorganize the local troops for a while, but gradual progress can be achieved day by day. Currently, counties such as Lü, Jiu, and Dan have followed the regulations on the reorganization of local militias in the bandit suppression provinces and have implemented military training in November and December of the 25th year in order to establish a good reputation, check household registrations, and implement joint responsibility. The bandit leaders Fang Jiting and Zheng Ziming were executed in Kangding. Recently, the registration and branding of self-defense guns in various counties is being carried out.</p>
<p>Educational Facilities</p>
<p>The Kangding Normal School's campus is now being expanded, and equipment is being supplemented. A Tibetan teacher training class is also attached to the school. The school has a total of 200 students. In addition to trying to restore schools in the bandit areas, provincial elementary schools have been established in Kangding, Jiulong, Luding, Ganzi, Danba, Ba'an Zhanhua. It is also planned to establish 49 one-year short-term elementary schools in various places outside Guanwai. Tibetan elementary schools have been established in Ba'an, Yajiang, Daofu, Ganzi, and Kangding.</p>
<p>Set Up Experimental Zone</p>
<p>A part of Kangding and Daofu counties has been designated as an experimental zone in Taining. Zhang Huachu has been appointed as the director of the zone, and a budget of 100,000 yuan has been allocated and is currently being launched. In addition, Zhao Zhongbao, a technician, has been sent to conduct a field survey of the highway line between Tianquan and Luding to find a shortcut for the Ya'an-Kangding highway. Technician Zhang has been sent to investigate the forest situation in the Moxi area and the situation of the Kangning Road to prepare for the reorganization of the Ningkang Road. These events have detailed regulations and cannot be fully discussed. It can be said that this is a career that can be done with very little financial resources, or even without spending a penny. He believes that he has done his best. Other larger careers, or careers that need to be carried out urgently, such as transportation, mining, water conservancy, and other economic constructions, are very important. However, apart from the central government's appropriation of subsidies, Xikang Province's own strength will definitely not be able to do it. He has lived in Xikang for more than four months. All the experiences are probably like this. In reality, there is not much achievement to speak of. Even if there is some achievement, it is only a small work like a beehive or ant nest. When it comes to the cause of establishing a province, then he can only be ashamed. If you understand the situation in Xikang and the economic capabilities of Xikang itself, if you want to formally build it into a provincial government, you can know that there are still many prerequisite issues, such as the provincial area issue, the military strength issue, the religious issue, the budget issue, the development issue, etc., which have not yet been resolved. There is no way to solve these prerequisite issues in Xikang. Therefore, he has to temporarily leave Kangding to find a solution outside. If you can give more help in spirit, so that the western national defense can gradually become consolidated, then it will be the happiness of the country's future, and it will be his supreme glory.</p>
<h3>Black Fever Epidemic in Northern Anhui</h3>
<p>Spreads to Over Ten Counties Including Xuyi and Taihe; High Death Toll Requires Urgent Prevention</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Black fever, commonly known as Pi disease, first became popular in the Huaidong area of northern Jiangsu. In recent years, the spread has become more widespread, and the number of infected people has increased. Successive deaths are alarming. The Jiangsu Provincial Government established a Black Fever Prevention Headquarters in Lianshui and hired a large number of medical personnel to carry out extermination work. More than 100,000 yuan was spent successively before the disease was slightly reduced. However, it has not been completely eradicated. Unexpectedly, in recent years, it has spread to northern Anhui, first becoming popular in Xuyi, Sixian, Lingbi, Fengyang, Huaiyuan, and other counties. Due to a lack of prevention in advance, and when this disease was discovered, there was a lack of medical personnel and equipment, it was difficult to diagnose and treat patients. It has evolved into a severe epidemic with many deaths. In recent months, it has spread to Sixian, Mengcheng, Guoyang, Fengtai Yingshang, and other counties. Even in the Taihe and Fuyang areas of the border area of northern Anhui adjacent to Henan Province, cases have been found intermittently. Almost no county in the upper and lower reaches of the Changhuai River is without it. If the authorities do not urgently seek extermination, it will not only spread to northern Anhui, but also have the possibility of invading eastern Henan. Its impact on national health is extremely profound and great. It is said that those who contract this disease have swollen abdomens, bleeding gums, gradually increasing fever, yellow face and thin muscles, and eventually cannot get up. There are still no medical organizations to prevent black fever in the Huaishang area. Even hospitals specializing in the treatment of this disease are lacking. Most patients gather in Huaiyuan to be diagnosed and treated in hospitals established by Americans. In the past, medical treatment was all done by surgery, and only 30-40% were cured. Now, a new drug for treating Pi disease, called New Stram, is injected intravenously and has proven to be effective. Since the beginning of this year, the hospital has diagnosed more than 2,700 people, with only 140 deaths. Medical circles and local people in this area all hope that the Anhui Provincial Government will follow the example of Jiangsu Province and quickly form a Black Fever Prevention Headquarters to carry out active extermination work to eliminate hidden dangers.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Villagers Destroy Police Station During Lantern Parade</h3>
<p>In the Xinzhuang area of the county, lantern parades have been popular recently, attracting large crowds in the evening and causing great disorder. The police bureau has repeatedly ordered the Xinzhuang branch to strictly prohibit them. Unexpectedly, the villagers gathered at the police station the night before, destroying everything. The police station arrested six ringleaders, including Wu Quanfu, and sent them to the county bureau for punishment.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Bank Robbery Plot Cracked</h3>
<p>The Second Police Station of this county cracked a plot to rob the Bank of China on the 12th, arresting the ringleader Qian Xinghua, his wife Li, his accomplices Zhao Baosheng, and four suspects, including Chen Shipei. Later, the detective team captured another accomplice, Sun Longquan, and recovered maps and other items. They were transferred to the police bureau on the 13th for interrogation. The case started because Qian Xinghua, a native of Changzhou, first operated a cloth factory in Shanghai, then opened a department store. Due to losses, he closed down in 24th year of the Republic and brought his wife Li to live in Suzhou. Last winter, he opened a newly rising toothbrush shop next to the back door of the Bank of China in Taigan Alley, Guanqian. He then met the coppersmith Zhao Baosheng and the electrician Sun Longquan and became sworn brothers. Recently, Qian suddenly had a whim and discussed with Zhao and Sun the plan to rob the Bank of China. Because Qian was next door to the bank, he repeatedly tried to find out about the bank's internal buildings and drew maps, preparing to flip in from the skylight of his toothbrush shop. He also instructed the coppersmith Zhao Baosheng to make fake pistols for use during the robbery. They had planned the robbery for a long time and had recently opened a room at the nearby Dongfang Hotel in Beiju to secretly discuss the plan. On the night of the 11th, officer Shen of the Second Police Station secretly learned of it. He first went to Room 131 of the Dongfang Hotel and captured Zhao Baosheng and two suspects, including Chen Shipei (although Chen and Zhao knew each other, Qian Xinghua and Zhao Baosheng denied that Chen was an accomplice). Then he went to No. 44, Mayike, and captured the ringleader Qian Xinghua and his wife Li and brought them to the station for questioning. There was still an accomplice, Sun Longquan, who was captured by the detective team at 6:00 PM. After separate inquiries, they were transferred to the bureau on the 13th. In addition to the maps, the seized evidence also included a copy of the sworn brotherhood, a book of murder weapons, and a set of fake beards. The prisoners all confessed that Qian was the mastermind. After the case was cracked, the chamber of commerce paid great attention to it. In the bustling city, someone was plotting to rob a bank, and the future of public security was worrying. It has now been decided to submit a meeting on the 15th, requesting the authorities to pay special attention to it. On the one hand, due to the lack of traffic tools for the detective team, it is planned to raise funds and purchase two or three motor bicycles to facilitate the work of the detectives.</p>

<h3>Zhenjiang: Expanding Agricultural Loan</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank believes that providing agricultural storage and loan can eliminate the suffering of farmers selling cheap, and can also enable farmers to save surplus funds, so as to activate rural finance. Therefore, the bank lists this work as one of its important businesses. The bank's rural loans in the 25th year amounted to more than 17 million yuan. However, the bank is not satisfied with this and will continue to actively expand agricultural loans in the future and plans to establish a provincial agricultural storage and transportation network in order to communicate the transportation between rural and urban areas and avoid the suffering of farmers harvesting agricultural products and local merchants exploiting them. The method is to set up agencies in branches and offices in various places to handle this business.</p>

The Yongmao fishing boat, which was protecting the fishing grounds, reported that the Japanese fishing boats had invaded our territorial waters, not only disrupting our entire fishing industry, but also hindering the livelihood of fishermen. Therefore, it requested the county fisheries association to immediately telegraph the province to stop this and protest to the Japanese consulate to have the vessels leave, in order to maintain the fishing industry and uphold our sovereign rights.</p>

<h3>The Head Office of the Farmers Bank of China Moves from Hankou to Shanghai</h3>
<p>A location has been found and office operations will begin on schedule.</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Farmers Bank of China, formerly known as the Farmers Bank of the Four Provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi, in addition to operating various ordinary banking businesses, especially focuses on operating agricultural warehouses and providing loans for the improvement of agricultural products, agricultural implements, and farmers' cooperatives. It issues agricultural bonds and farmers' circulation notes, and discounts agricultural bills. In 1935, it was renamed the Farmers Bank of China, expanding its original business area in the four provinces to the entire country. In 1936, it was specially authorized by the Ministry of Finance to issue 100 million yuan in legal currency, half of which was used to develop the rural economy and handle land mortgage loans. Branches were established throughout the country. Over the past year, its business has been thriving, making it an authority in our agricultural banking.</p>

<h3>The Real Estate Industry Association Requests Negotiations for the Complete Repeal</h3>
<p>Of the Municipal Council's Increase in Municipal Surtax and Land Tax</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Real Estate Industry Association of this city, because the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession disregarded the interests of the citizens and planned to increase the municipal surtax and land tax, although it has now declared a postponement until January of next year for further consideration, has still failed to achieve a complete repeal. Therefore, it has specially submitted a document to the municipal government requesting negotiations based on reason to achieve the goal of repeal. At the same time, it has also sent letters to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Municipal Council, stating that</p>
<p>They Vow Not to Acknowledge the Increase</p>
<p>In taxes, the original text states: According to reports,</p>
<p>At the meeting of the Municipal Council directors on March 24 of this year, it was decided that the municipal surtax (i.e., the police tax) of the Public Concession would be increased from 14% to 16%, and the land tax would be increased from 7 per mille to 8 per mille. Although the Chinese directors unanimously opposed it at the time, the result was a 6-to-5 vote in favor. After investigating, we found that the number of five Chinese directors in the board of directors is less than that of foreign directors due to special relations, but the amount of donation they represent accounts for more than 64%, and the population accounts for more than 95%. In order to develop and prosper municipal administration, the Municipal Council should consider the public opinion of all citizens, adapt to the economic conditions of the city and the burden capacity of the public, and formulate policies. Now, at a time when real estate is declining, vacant houses are increasing day by day, rents are falling repeatedly, and the market is exhausted, it suddenly increases taxes to make up for wasteful budget calculations. Is this not the same as planting trees and pulling out their roots, guiding canals and blocking their sources, drinking poison to quench thirst? Although it can be pleasing for a while, it will eventually cause endless harm. Because the association has a greater stake in the matter, it cannot ignore it. The 11th joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee was held for a special</p>
<p>Solemn Declaration</p>
<p>㊀ The foreign directors of the Municipal Council can only represent the rights and obligations of foreign residents, accounting for 35% of the city's donation amount and 5% of the population. They absolutely cannot represent the public opinion of the majority of taxpayers. Therefore, it vows not to acknowledge the resolutions passed by the board of directors this time. ㊁ It is absolutely impossible to accept the decision to increase taxes during this period of market decline and consecutive bankruptcies of real estate merchants. ㊂ There is absolutely no room for reviewing or changing tax rates before the Municipal Council has tightened its budget, abolished the remittance allowances for foreign employees, and abolished the impractical music team. The above items are all related to the lifeline of the real estate industry in the city. We dare to ask your government to negotiate based on reason and strive to repeal this resolution, reduce the burden on the people, conform to public opinion, and maintain sovereignty. We are extremely grateful. We respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Municipal Government and send separate letters to the Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association and the Municipal Council with the same wording, without further elaboration.</p>
<h3>The New Italian Ambassador Meets with Reporters and Delivers a Speech</h3>
<p>Expressing Sympathy for Our Country</p>
<p>The newly appointed Italian Ambassador to China, Mr. Crolla, arrived in Shanghai on the 12th by ship to assume his new post. At 11 a.m. yesterday, at the office of the Italian Embassy in China at 555 Jing'an Temple Road, he met with reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers in this city and delivered an English</p>
<p>Written statement, translated as follows: I am pleased to represent Italy in China. The friendly relations between China and Italy have existed for centuries. The long-standing cultures of the two countries have long been connected, and the friendship between the two peoples has an even longer history. This appointment is based on the diplomatic intent of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Mr. Ciano has always expressed admiration for modern China. China and Italy are both working hard for peace. I plan to go to Nanjing in a few days to meet with the central authorities of China. Today, I publish this written statement in various newspapers to express my sympathy for the Chinese people. Based on this sympathy, I will strive to promote my duties.</p>
<p>Regarding the Far East issue, he said that he had just arrived in China and it was not convenient to express his views at this time. Mr. Crolla also mentioned that he had worked in Tokyo, Japan, from 1919 to 1920 and later went to the United States to participate in the Washington Conference. In 1920, I passed through Shanghai. This time I arrived in Shanghai and saw that Shanghai's prosperity is no longer what it used to be. This is very commendable. Regarding Sino-Italian trade, Mr. Crolla also briefly mentioned that the past situation was very good. In the future, I will strive to make the economic relations between the two countries more progressive.</p>

<h3>The Ratepayers’ Association Opposes the Increase in Taxes and Yesterday Published a Letter to Western Taxpayers</h3>
<p>Only by Holding Tight to Our Pockets Can We Make the Municipal Council Aware and Vigilant</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession issued a letter to Western taxpayers in opposition to the increase in taxes, stating: The malformed organization of the concession prevents Chinese and foreign taxpayers from meeting together to discuss important matters. This is such a regrettable thing. Now we take this opportunity to make it clear to you what our opinions are on the Municipal Council's proposed increase in taxes, which was originally scheduled for July 1 of this year, but has now been postponed to June 1. Chinese taxpayers believe that the Municipal Council, if it is willing, can already maintain a balance of revenue and expenditure without resorting to tax increases. We have carefully studied this year's budget and feel that the Municipal Council's estimates of tax revenue, especially for the general tax, are overly pessimistic, and all the austerity measures are not thorough and are misplaced. We must know that the revenue from the general tax has always been very stable and reliable. In the past ten years, it has been increasing year by year, only decreasing by 700,000 yuan in 1936. However, this decrease was entirely in the first half of the year, and it had already returned to normal in the second half of the year. Not only had the actual amount received and paid reached 101% of the second half of 1935, but the amount receivable and payable had also returned to 98%. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that the revenue from the general tax in 1937 can reach at least the amount of 1935. If we take the past tax revenue situation as the standard, plus the current economic recovery, perhaps the tax revenue may even increase and gradually restore the previous rate of increase, which is not overly optimistic. The Municipal Council's revenue has been increasing year by year, and the Municipal Council's expenditures have also been increasing year by year, sometimes faster than the increase in revenue. This is worth noting. The main reason for the current economic difficulties is that in 1930 and 1931, the increase in revenue was only normal, while the increase in expenditure was rapid and abnormal. Even in 1936, when tax revenue was about 200,000 yuan less than in 1935, expenditure increased by 1.2 million yuan. If we remember that the Municipal Council has accumulated unpaid general taxes of 2.5 million yuan, equivalent to the annual revenue from a 2% tax increase, it is not difficult to find the crux of the financial difficulties. Of course, we cannot deny the Municipal Council's austerity policies. We know that the Municipal Council's fire department's austerity measures save 200,000 yuan per year, and the abolition of redundant agencies saves about 100,000 yuan per year. But we also know that the Municipal Council once paid the former director of the Public Works Department as a retirement allowance, and once paid the former director-general as a resignation allowance. As for the tightening of the staff, it saves 1.06 million yuan per year, but the exchange compensation has been changed to a permanent nature, which amounted to 1.88 million yuan in 1936. In addition, more than 90 senior employees have been given new exchange compensation. The Municipal Council's preferential treatment of senior employees is often dissatisfied not only by Chinese people, but also by Westerners. Chinese and foreign newspapers often publish similar opinions. As for the music team, it is indeed a cultural entertainment during prosperous times, but it becomes a luxury during declining times. The proposal to abolish it is supported by most Westerners. Even the disbanding of the Russian team is no different. A Westerner said that the Russian team is merely a "toy army," which is not an exaggeration. In addition, the expenses of various administrative departments have increased rapidly. For example, the police department was only 5.5 million yuan in 1929, but it increased to more than 9 million yuan in 1931. Within two years, it increased by more than 4 million yuan, which is a cause for concern and questioning by Chinese and foreign taxpayers alike, "Is there any end to such expansion?" Therefore, our opposition to the tax increase is not out of self-interest, but is actually in response to the sound and impartial public opinion of foreigners. The Director-General of the Municipal Council said that the amount of the increase is extremely low. For example, those who pay 10 yuan in rent per month only pay an additional 20 cents. It should be known that our opposition is not focused on the monetary aspect. As the Director-General explained, we believe that the current financial difficulties are the result of years of waste. Only by holding tight to our pockets can we make the Municipal Council aware and vigilant in managing finances. What we are fighting for is the principle, not the size of the amount. As for the statement that the tax rate in Shanghai is lower than in other parts of the world, it is not a sufficient reason for increasing taxes. It is clear that the Municipal Council has now decided to extend the deadline by six months. Yesterday, we passed the following resolution at the meeting: The proposal of the Public Concession Municipal Council to increase taxes from July 1, 1937, should be postponed to the next year for further consideration, and the Municipal Council should be ordered to effectively reduce unnecessary expenses and collect arrears within this year in order to achieve reasonable measures. The wording is very clear. If your association can adopt the same resolution, as long as it is in line with us in spirit and in practice, without being bound by the wording, then we express our great welcome.</p>
<h3>Representatives of Grain Merchants from Six Provinces and Cities Visit Cheng Tiangu</h3>
<p>To State Their Opinions on the Pros and Cons of Guangdong's Exemption from Foreign Rice Tax</p>
<p>The issue of Guangdong Province's exemption from the foreign rice tax has been under contention by five provinces and cities in the Yangtze River basin. The government has now complied with public opinion and is re-examining the matter. Vice Minister of Industry Cheng Tiangu will also travel to Guangdong today (the 14th). In addition to contacting the Qiongya Inspection Group, he will personally investigate the province's grain situation. Representatives of grain merchants from six provinces and cities, Gu Xinyi and Chen Ziyi, accompanied by Luo Qinghua, a member of the city's Chamber of Commerce, visited</p>
<p>Vice Minister Cheng</p>
<p>At his residence at about 10 a.m. yesterday.</p>
<p>Luo Qinghua and others first stated their intentions and explained how Guangdong Province's exemption from the foreign rice tax would affect the sales of domestic rice. Vice Minister Cheng said that both sides have their own reasons, and the actual situation needs to be clarified after he arrives in Guangdong. He then asked the representatives to submit a summary for review and approval. The representatives then took their leave.</p>
<p>Grain Merchants' Opinions</p>
<p>According to the grain merchant representatives, they issued the following opinions to the press yesterday regarding Guangdong Province's exemption from the foreign rice tax: ㊀ Now that Guangdong Province is requesting exemption from the foreign rice tax, allowing foreign rice to be imported in whole batches and causing domestic rice to stagnate, which is more important, the benefits or the harm? Please uphold justice in public opinion. ㊁ Last year, there was a bumper harvest in various places, and various industries were thriving. The prices of various commodities were rising, increasing the burden and expenses of farmers. Only the price of rice remained the same as before and even showed a downward trend. What is the impact on the farmers' economy? Please also make a fair analysis in public opinion. ㊂ Now, because Guangdong Province is requesting exemption from the foreign rice tax, other coastal provinces and cities will also use the excuse of rice shortage and successively request exemption from the foreign rice tax. This will not only affect the revenue of domestic taxes, but will also restore the situation in the past where foreign rice filled the domestic market. The impact of this is even more unimaginable. This should also be explained in public opinion. In short, Guangdong Province initially requested relief from the central government due to a rice shortage. The central government ordered the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to fully provide relief with the surplus rice from various places. Now, as the various provinces are providing relief to Guangdong to gradually stabilize the rice shortage, there is suddenly a move to implement an exemption from the foreign rice tax, which does not seem appropriate.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Provincial Government Reiterates the Ban on Opium Order</h3>
<p>Complete Ban is Near Next Year / Opium Addicts Must Not Increase Their Dosage</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, because the province's opium ban work has reached the third year and must be completely banned in the fourth year (i.e., before September 30, 1938), especially issued an order to the county governments of Shanghai, Baoshan, Jiading, and other counties near the city, stating: After investigating recently, we found that in each county un-reformed opium addicts are extremely few among the those who have complied with the decreasing dosage regulations, and cases of applying to increase the dosage have been discovered, we find this to be severely discordant with the regulations. The Provincial Opium Ban Committee regulation of, allowing those who have concealed the usage amount to be reported, this regulation is meant for early-registered opium users, there is absolutely no circumstance under which allowing increased dosage is permitted, strictly punishing any cases of reporting increased amounts for personal usage or for feeding others the substance, in order to better enact the opium ban regulations.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Coastal Fisheries Situation</h3>
<p>Industrial Department Investigator Returns to Shanghai Yesterday, Will Inspect Songjiang and Jinshan Areas Today, and Then Go to Changshu, Nantong, and Other Places the Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>Rao Yongbi and Liu Chongde, dispatched by the Industrial Department to inspect the fisheries situation along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, completed their inspection of the coastal areas of Zhejiang and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning (the 13th). Today (the 14th), they will go to inspect the coastal areas of Songjiang and Jinshan, and the day after tomorrow they will depart for Changshu, Nantong, Rugao, Yancheng, Haimen, and other places to continue their inspection. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with Rao and Liu yesterday. According to them, the living conditions of fishermen in various coastal areas of Zhejiang are as follows:</p>
<p>Three-Week Inspection Quite Detailed</p>
<p>The places visited this time include fishing villages belonging to Dinghai, Zhenhai, Ningbo, Xiangshan, Wenzhou, Ruian, Pingyang, Yuhuan, and other counties. They departed on the 21st of last month and have been gone for three weeks. The inspection of the Zhoushan Islands and the Shengsi Islands was relatively detailed, as this area is particularly important for fisheries. However, it is a pity that it was not the fish spawning season, so there is still a sense of imperfection.</p>
<p>Fishing Techniques Are All Old Methods</p>
<p>The fishermen in various coastal areas of Zhejiang are quite experienced, so their harvests are abundant. Although the fishing techniques are all old methods, given the current difficult economic situation of the fishermen and their proficiency in using old methods, they are also considered suitable. The Fujian fishermen in that area mostly use longline hooks. In the past, because the copper hooks they made were relatively thick, they did not catch much. Now, they have made the copper hooks thinner and placed the bait on the hooks, which moves with the water, making the sea fish suspect it is a living thing and swallow it, so it is easier to hook and catch them. There are also drift nets, which are several miles long, but they are not very practical because they are often disturbed by fishing boats, so they have gradually decreased. There are also large pair boats, which means that two boats set out together at the same time, one being a net boat and the other a cooking boat. The net boat is equipped with fishing hooks and nets, while the cooking boat specializes in cooking food. In the sea, the two boats travel side by side, dragging the hooks and nets into the sea. This kind of fishing boat is like a new type of hand-operated net boat, with excellent effectiveness and low cost. There is also net fishing, but because its mesh is very dense, small fish are also caught inside, which has a special impact on fish reproduction and should be restricted.</p>
<p>Fishermen's Lives Should Be Improved Quickly</p>
<p>Regarding the lives of fishermen, improvements should be sought quickly. Their heavy superstition and lack of attention to hygiene often cause fishermen to waste their lives. At the same time, the habits of smoking, drinking, and gambling are very prevalent. In recent years, although smoking and gambling have been strictly prohibited in some places, drinking and sex are even more prevalent. Therefore, in the future, on the one hand, special education closely related to fishermen should be organized, and at the same time, various proper entertainments should be organized.</p>
<p>Profiteering Exploitation Should Be Corrected Urgently</p>
<p>The various exploitations suffered by fishermen are difficult to know in detail unless you visit the area yourself. During the fish spawning season, fishermen are busy fishing, and the fish they catch cannot be stored for a long time. General iced fish boats are allowed to buy them at will, and the iced fish boats must then resell them to the fish market, and the fish market then transfers them to other places for sale. With such repeated buying and selling, it is difficult for fishermen to seek good prices. However, fishermen must purchase various fishing tools before each fish spawning season, or borrow money to maintain their lives when it is not the fish spawning season. The lowest interest rate is more than 20%, and the highest is as high as 60% or 70%, resulting in the fishermen's lives becoming increasingly impoverished. This is something that should be quickly relieved.</p>
<p>Cooperative Undertakings Need to Be Organized Urgently</p>
<p>The method of relief is to organize various cooperative undertakings as an urgent task at present. All cooperative undertakings such as consumption, transportation, sales, and credit should be carried out practically. Although cooperative instructors and fishery instructors have now been set up in various places, they are not yet widespread. In the future, if the fishery loan group can allocate huge amounts of money, it will be easier to carry out, and the benefits for fishermen will be more than trivial.</p>

<h3>All Factories Under Meiya Jingwei Factory Suspend Work Starting Yesterday After Strike</h3>
<p>Factory Asks Central Government to Punish Severely, Jinxin Workers Petitioned the Party Headquarters Yesterday</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, silk weaving factory workers improved their treatment. After the ruling, the municipal government handled the industry association's appeal case in accordance with the law. The Social Affairs Bureau has submitted the reply to the government for approval. All factories under Meiya announced a suspension of work last night due to the strike at the Jingwei Factory and a shortage of raw materials. They also reported to the Party and government and the central Party headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry, etc., requesting relief. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>All Meiya Factories Suspend Work Starting Yesterday</p>
<p>The factories under Meiya are: ⑴ Main Factory in Dapuqiao, Nanshi; ⑵ No. 2 Factory on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei; ⑶ No. 4 Factory on Xiaoshadu Road, Husi; ⑷ No. 5 Factory on Xieshi Road, Nanshi; ⑸ No. 6 Factory on Xieshi Road, Nanshi; ⑹ No. 7 Factory on Quzhenren Road, Nanshi; ⑺ No. 9 Factory on Xujiahui Road, French Concession; ⑻ No. 10 Factory on Baziqiao Road, Zhabei. The warp and weft (raw materials) of the above factories are all supplied by the Meiya Jingwei Factory in Dapuqiao. Now, due to the strike of the workers at the Jingwei Factory, the warp and weft have run out, and each weaving factory is unable to weave, so they have all suspended work starting last night. The announcement reads: It has been found that the workers of the Jingwei Factory's main factory have illegally restarted the labor movement. After the strike resumed on the evening of the 10th of this month, it has been two days and two nights, causing the warp and weft stored in each weaving factory to be used up, putting them in a situation of no rice to cook. This company has suffered extremely serious damage and is bound to go bankrupt. It is inevitable that we will suspend work at 6:00 p.m. on the 13th of this month after the day shift is completed. All responsibilities for this inevitable suspension of work shall be borne by the workers who went on strike this time. This is announced on April 13.</p>
<p>Report to the Party and Government Explaining the Reasons</p>
<p>The Meiya Factory reported to Acting Mayor Yu, Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan, and the Municipal Party Headquarters: The report is for the workers of the Jingwei Factory of the main factory going on strike, resulting in a shortage of raw materials, weaving factories unable to work, and being forced to suspend work on schedule, waiting for approval. It has been found that the workers of the warp and weft factory of the company's Rihui East Road main factory resumed the strike on the afternoon of the 10th of this month, starting at 6:00 p.m. It has been two days and two nights, causing the warp and weft stored to be completely woven, and the weaving factories have become without rice to cook and unable to continue working. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters have not yet punished the initiators of the strike, causing the labor unrest to be delayed and unable to be restrained, and the factory has no protection. It is inevitable that each weaving factory will be suspended starting at 6:00 p.m. today. If the workers of the Jingwei Factory do not resume work for one day, there will be no warp and weft for one day. If there is no warp and weft for one day, the weaving factory cannot resume work for one day. This kind of strike method is completely the most ferocious and is a strategy to put the company to death. The strike of the Jingwei Factory is equivalent to the strike of the weaving factories together. This kind of strategy cannot be thought of by workers with simple minds. There is no doubt that there are others manipulating behind the scenes. At present, the company has been severely damaged and suffered huge losses. How can it withstand being ravaged again? The environment is so unavoidable. All of the forced suspension of work this time should be the responsibility of the striking workers. The facts are presented sincerely. We hope that you will review and handle them. It is really kind. Respectfully submitted.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Central Government Requesting Severe Punishment</p>
<p>The Meiya Factory sent a fast mail telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Industry: In the case of the general strike of silk weaving workers in Shanghai, all the initiators and the manipulators behind the scenes have not been punished by the Shanghai Party and government. Therefore, although work has been resumed on the surface, the manipulators have come up with other evil plans to instigate the workers of the Meiya Jingwei Factory and the Meiya Main Factory to resume the strike on Gray Evening. It has been two days and two nights. The Shanghai Party and government have not yet imposed sanctions on the illegal striking workers, causing the workers' situation to become more and more arrogant. It has been found that the Jingwei Factory is a factory that manufactures warp and weft. If the weaving factory has no warp and weft for one day, it cannot work for one day. Now the warp and weft stored in the weaving factory have been completely woven, and it is inevitable that each weaving factory will be suspended starting from the evening of Yuan, waiting for the Shanghai Party and government to severely punish the initiators of the strike and the manipulators behind the scenes to eliminate the chaos. If you do not cut off the fuel under the cauldron to seek a fundamental plan, and only superficially decorate for a while, as a temporary solution, it will inevitably lead to nurturing a boil to cause a great disaster. The company will be ravaged by it, resulting in bankruptcy. The damage caused by the evil plans of the workers this time has been severe and difficult to resume. All responsibilities for the suspension of work should be borne by the workers. The facts are presented sincerely. We hope that you will review and handle it. The General Manager of Meiya Silk Weaving Factory Co., Ltd., Cai Shengbai, kowtows with extreme trepidation. Yuan Yin.</p>
<p>Meiya Workers Mediated Yesterday</p>
<p>After the strike of the workers at the Meiya Baziqiao No. 10 Factory, the Social Affairs Bureau convened an interview at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Wang, the factory director of No. 10 Factory, and Wang Jisong, the labor representative, etc., were present. Wang Xianqing, the director of the mediation section of the Third Division, chaired the meeting, and Jiang Shifu recorded it. First, he inquired about the strike of the workers. The settlement methods for the machine contract system and the wages for statutory holidays, etc., have been ruled and resolved. Although the capital party has filed an administrative appeal, it should wait for the municipal government to approve it in accordance with the law, and workers are advised to abide by the joint announcement of the Party and government organs and resume work on a scheduled date. It did not disperse until after 5:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Jinxin Workers Petitioned as a Whole</p>
<p>After the workers of Jinxin Silk Factory on Pingliang Road continued their strike against the factory's recruitment of new workers, Zou Bozong of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Union, He Yaolou Zongfang, and other representatives of Jinxin workers led more than 100 workers from the factory to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters from the new site of the Fourth District Union at Tonglefang, Huasheng Road, yesterday morning. Zhou Funong, the section chief, received them and allowed the Party and government organs to negotiate with the Jinxin Factory so that the original workers could resume work as a whole. Regarding the dismissal of ten representatives, the capital party will be summoned immediately to mediate together to quell the labor unrest. When the petition was heard, the Silk Weaving Union of the First District of Nanshi immediately sent personnel to express condolences and brought a large number of food to provide for the workers to fill their hunger, expressing sympathy for their assistance. Before leaving, the Municipal Party Headquarters presented 10 yuan for transportation expenses, expressing condolences. The workers were very satisfied and took the bus back together at 1:00 p.m., deciding to wait quietly for the authorities to send someone to lead the resumption of work.</p>
<h3>Implementation of South African Tenancy Law Is Awaiting</h3>
<p>Ministry of Foreign Affairs Telegraphed to the Chamber of Commerce, No Report Received on Hindrance of Business Licenses</p>
<p>The National Chamber of Commerce of this city received a fast mail telegram No. 2539 from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, which read: National Chamber of Commerce, General Jian, the telegraph of the mill is clear. Regarding the South African government's implementation of the tenancy law, the Ministry has telegraphed to the Consulate General in Johannesburg to investigate and negotiate. According to the telegram from the consulate on March 20, it had inquired twice about the Tenancy Law Review Committee, and it said that the implementation date had not yet been determined and could be extended for another two years, etc. As for the hindrance of business licenses, the consulate has not received any reports, and it has not heard that the overseas Chinese community has sent representatives, etc. It is hoped that it will be investigated and notified.</p>
<h3>American Expert Mr. Leiter Talks About Chinese Agriculture</h3>
<p>Great Development in the Future</p>
<p>According to the Continental News, Major Leiter, an American economist and engineer, has been away from Shanghai for eight years and has now returned to this land with his wife. From 1928 to 1929, Major Leiter led the Asian Expedition Team to investigate the commercial agricultural products of Asia, starting from Manchuria on the Siberian border, passing through Korea, China, Vietnam, and ending in Malaysia. Major Leiter was thus able to examine the problems of China, which values agriculture, and the excellent opportunities for many agricultural fieldwork methods. Major Leiter said that China is an agricultural country, and the major steps it should take for agriculture in the future are the improvement of planting, the cultivation of seeds, and the control of pests. Chinese farmers are the most hard-working in the world. They have been farming for 4,000 years. This record cannot be matched by any country. If Chinese farmers can be taught to widely use insecticide powder, plant new plants, and try new seeds, the yield per acre of farmland will be more than that obtained by any farmer in the world. China's future is really close to this point. China now imports a large amount of foreign rice every year. If it can rectify agriculture, it can harvest two crops of rice that used to be harvested once a year. China is rich in advanced talents in agricultural economy and agricultural research. What is needed now is to enable the people to display what they have learned and to have someone start working on the "fire line." Major also said that the first "fire line" experience he gained was 30 years ago when he led a team of scholars in Honduras to go deep into the mountains and forests to open a plantation. At that time, we slept in the forest at night, looked for roads to advance, and reclaimed 1,000 acres of land to plant bananas, and then opened another area to plant sugarcane and a small part of pineapples. Currently, Major has 5,000 acres of land in Mexico to test cotton. However, Major's intention is that his future is extremely dark, because there are currently several other countries in the world that produce cotton on a large scale, and their cost is cheaper than cotton from the United States and Mexico. The only hope for success now lies in the cotton produced by Major's Mexican farm after years of testing, because the edge dimension is longer than that produced elsewhere and must be popular. Major now plans to stay in Nanjing before going to South China for inspection. Major intends that the climate in South China is warm and many things can be planted. The development of China's agricultural future must be in the south. Major also believes that there are many kinds of plants in the world that are suitable for planting in China to promote agriculture and profit.</p>
<h3>Lu Bohong Talks About the Heavy Henan Disaster</h3>
<p>Western Henan Is the Worst, Northern Henan Is Second</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Bohong, who went to Henan with the Relief Federation of Charitable Organizations in this city to investigate and release disaster relief, has returned to Shanghai. Mr. Lu reported the disaster situation in the province and the investigation situation to the relevant parties. The details of Mr. Lu's trip to Henan are as follows:</p>
<p>Disaster Situation Is Dire</p>
<p>The disaster situation in the province is the worst in western Henan and second in northern Henan. All rivers in each county have dried up, and people are suffering from hunger and starvation. It is difficult to get a full meal within a few days. Selling children can be seen everywhere. Emergency disaster relief and reconstruction are currently underway at the same time.</p>
<p>Allocation of Disaster Relief Funds</p>
<p>A total of 820,000 yuan has been raised for disaster relief in Henan, of which 320,000 yuan was allocated by the Ministry of Finance, 100,000 yuan was raised in Shanghai, and 400,000 yuan was allocated by the Henan Provincial Government. Now, 600,000 yuan has been allocated to the 29 counties with the most serious disaster situations in western and northern Henan to handle current emergency disaster relief, 50,000 yuan to handle labor relief on the Luotong Road, 20,000 yuan to handle medical treatment and reception, and 30,000 yuan as pocket money. There is still 120,000 yuan, which was originally used to handle the labor relief on the four major highways in the province. Now that the funding for the road construction project has been settled, it has been changed to excavate rivers, ditches, and wells.</p>
<p>Start Implementing Disaster Relief</p>
<p>In order to give disaster victims practical benefits and prevent all kinds of malpractices, the disaster relief funds used this time will be jointly responsible by the county governments, the local missionary associations, and the personnel sent by the Shanghai Relief Association. It has already started, and all procedures will be simplified and expedited.</p>
<h3>Head and Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Office Pay a Return Visit to the Finnish Minister</h3>
<p>Zhou Jue and Zhao Tiezhang, the head and deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Office in Shanghai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, went to the International Hotel together at 11:30 a.m. yesterday to visit the newly appointed Finnish Minister Fan Wen to pay a return visit. They met and talked for half an hour before leaving. It is said that they discussed the presentation of credentials by the Finnish Minister.</p>
<h3>Party and Government Investigated Yesterday the Conditions Requested by Tram Workers</h3>
<p>Will Schedule Formal Mediation</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, after the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company of the Public Concession rejected the five conditions for treatment requested by all the workers, they sent representatives to the Party and government organs to petition for assistance. After the Party and government organs persuaded the workers to wait quietly for mediation, Lu Yinchu from the Municipal Party Headquarters and Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau went to the company at 4:00 p.m. yesterday to investigate the truth. They met with the company's General Manager Ivan and the comprador Hu Ziyu, etc. After inquiring about the situation in detail, they immediately left and reported to the responsible officials, and then scheduled to notify both parties for formal mediation.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xuefan Spoke Overseas</h3>
<p>Extraterritoriality Is Detrimental to Chinese Labor, Our Country's Yarn Factories Are Deeply Threatened by Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>According to Da Gong She, Zhu Xuefan, the labor representative of our country attending the Washington World Textile Conference, said to the United Press that foreign yarn factories, especially Japan, have established textile factories in the extraterritorial areas of China, employing Chinese workers, accounting for 46%. This situation is extremely detrimental to the labor force throughout our country, because the establishment of this kind of factory never follows the factory laws and regulations of our country or other countries. At the same time, the treatment of workers averages 11 hours a day, and the wage is only 18 cents. Mr. Zhu went on to say that in such an unreasonable state, the future of our country's yarn factories is greatly affected, and what is more to hope for is the improvement of work in the factory.</p>

<h3>Bandits Looted People and Goods and Extorted Ransom, Dared to Open Fire to Resist Arrest</h3>
<p>One Bandit Wounded and Jumped into the Huangpu River to Escape, Detective of the Water Patrol Station Bravely Arrested Him</p>
<p>At about 1:00 a.m. on the 11th of this month, several dock bandits occurred on the Huangpu River at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi. They intercepted three sacks of game bamboo chickens purchased by the Xieshang Game Shop on Nanxun Road and demanded a rogue fee of 50 yuan unsuccessfully. They took a passenger along with all the game to the Huangpu River at Lujiadu, Yongdong, and ordered them to immediately</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau Forbids Night Soil Collectors from Taking Tips</h3>
<p>Night Soil Collectors Petition for Wage Increase</p>
<p>The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession recently announced that night soil collectors should not charge for removing chamber pots. The original text said, "Notice is hereby given that night soil collectors do not charge for removing chamber pots. However, the maximum fee for removing chamber pots upstairs is four cents per month, including the cleaning fee. If there are any extra demands, the Public Works Bureau should be notified immediately. It is appropriate to notify the public." The special night soil collectors believe that this move by the Public Works Bureau is tantamount to cutting off the livelihood of the workers, so they decided to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Taxpayers' Association, the Citizens' Association, and other agencies within days to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau to increase wages in order to maintain the livelihood of their families.</p>
<h3>Courtroom Theft Suspects Stage "Head-Banging Protest"</h3>
<p>Reason: Unwilling to be Returned to Police Custody; Subdued and Persuaded to Comply</p>
<p>Detectives from the French Concession Police, apprehended eleven theft suspects, including Zhang Jinsheng, Gong Quancai, Chen Guifang, and Wu Amao, within the concession the day before yesterday. It was found that Wu was the ringleader, and nine of them had been repeatedly punished for previous offenses. Yesterday afternoon, Zhang and the others were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. Presiding Judge Sun Peng questioned them, and Attorney Yao Zhaodi of the Xiangwu Law Firm requested an extension for further investigation and prosecution. When questioned, Zhang and the others all denied the theft, claiming that if detained in the police station, they would inevitably suffer torture and requested to be transferred to the detention center. The court ruled that the case had not yet been investigated and could not grant the transfer, adjourning the hearing for twenty days. The defendants were to be returned to police custody. The defendants protested the ruling, shouting grievances and demanding to be transferred. After being taken to the waiting room by bailiffs, they refused to be handcuffed when being escorted back to the police station after the court adjourned. They repeatedly banged their heads against the walls and water spouts on the ground, declaring that they would rather die in the courtroom than return to the police station to suffer. The bailiffs tried to stop them, but they resisted forcefully, making it impossible for the police to restrain them. They sounded the police whistle, summoning all the bailiffs to the scene to suppress the riot. Officers were dispatched to persuade them. Zhang Jinsheng had already smashed his head, leaving him covered in blood, resembling Guan Yu. The officers ordered him to be sent to the forensic doctor for examination and bandaging. After some persuasion, the suspects finally complied and were taken back to the police station by the bailiffs. The disturbance was declared over.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Encourages Rubber Tires for Hand-Pulled Carts</h3>
<p>License Fees Reduced by Half</p>
<p>In order to improve the road surface, the Shanghai Municipal Council considered requiring hand-pulled carts and "tiger carts" to use rubber tires last year. After negotiations with the Hand-Pulled Cart Mutual Aid Association, the implementation was temporarily suspended. Now, the Council has received approval from the Board of Directors to encourage the use of pneumatic tires on hand-pulled carts. For those who convert old-fashioned iron wheels to pneumatic tires, all license fees will be reduced by half.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Sends Letter to Shanghai Municipal Council Protesting Deadline for Demolishing Shanties</h3>
<p>The Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, yesterday. It reads: "Sir, according to letters received by our Association from shanty residents Tang Anping, Liu Hanqing, Ding Mingshan, Ruan Bu-kuan, Xu Xiyuan, Sun Xudan, Sun Jianjin, Liu Hejin, Zou Weizheng, Xu Yunfei, Liu Shihong, Zhang Buyun, Zhou Shigong, Xu Wanfu, Xu Congxin, Zhang Shouxian, etc. (the original letters have appeared in various newspapers), the 'freedom of residence' is a universal principle of the constitution, and 'property rights' are protected by law. Infringing on 'freedom of residence' is 'unconstitutional,' and destroying 'property rights' is 'illegal.' By what constitution and what law does your council intend to infringe upon and destroy the 'freedom of residence' and 'property rights' of shanty residents? As a 'quasi-autonomous body' that calls itself a rule of law, such illegal intentions are an insult to the council, an insult to public servants, and an insult to all constituents. An 'quasi-autonomous body' with ninety years of history and annual revenue of over twenty million yuan, whose highest-paid official receives an annual salary of about fifty thousand yuan, does not seek to improve the livelihoods of its residents but allows them to solve their problems themselves, living in crude shanties. This is a shame that cannot be washed away by all the water in the Xijiang River. Furthermore, to attempt to illegally infringe upon and destroy their homes is a crime that cannot be written down even with all the bamboo in the Nanshan Mountains. It must be understood that the establishment of 'freedom of residence' and 'property rights' is achieved through 'survival competition.' After reading the constitutional and legal histories of various countries, especially England and the United States, it should be clear that when such 'freedom of residence' and 'property rights' are infringed upon and destroyed by violence, the letters and spirit of the constitution and laws temporarily become invalid, and ultimately, they are restored to their 'true existence' through 'natural sanctions' and 'political sanctions.' The leaders of your council mostly come from constitutionalist families and are well-versed in the law. Although they may be temporarily blinded by the saying 'might makes right,' the historical fact that 'right makes might' is not entirely absent. In light of the aforementioned situation, we hereby request that you, Director-General, take responsibility for handling this matter to safeguard 'freedom of residence' and protect 'property rights.' Addressed to Fessenden, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council."</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting for the Blacksmiths' Union</h3>
<p>Dong Gengguan and Others Elected as Preparatory Committee Members</p>
<p>This city has a vast territory and a gathering of all trades. Labor-capital disputes and skill competitions are progressing day by day. Therefore, all trades have organizations to strive for survival. However, the blacksmithing industry has long lacked an organization, and labor-capital disputes often arise, making resolution extremely difficult. Now, Dong Gengguan and other workers in the industry, recognizing this, have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Blacksmithing Industry Workers' Union. Their application to the Municipal Party Headquarters has been approved, and a permit was issued the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon, a preparatory meeting was held at the association hall in Zhabei, attended by more than forty initiators. Dong Gengguan was elected as chairman. He reported on the necessity and significance of organizing the union. Eleven preparatory committee members were elected: Dong Gengguan, Zhu Ronggen, Tang Zhuying, He Shunzhi, Xu Xianggen, Wu Peisheng, Tao Ageng, Wu Changsheng, Xu Zigen, Qian Xingsheng, and Fan Shaoxing. They are responsible for the preparation. The first preparatory meeting was then held, electing Dong Gengguan, Zhu Ronggen, and Tang Zhuying as standing members, He Shunzhi as general affairs, Xu Xianggen as publicity, Wu Peisheng as organization, Wu Changsheng as investigation, and Tao Ageng as investigation. Gu Wenkai was hired as secretary. The union headquarters has been leased at No. 18 Changxing Lane, Xinjiang Road, Zhabei. Registration will begin on the 15th of this month and end on the 15th of May.</p>
<h3>Third Trial Verdict in Gu Zhuxuan's Smoking Case: Two Guards Sentenced</h3>
<p>Convicted of Shielding Opium Smoking; Two Sentenced to Five Years Imprisonment Each</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan from Yancheng, implicated in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, was detained in the Guangci Hospital outside the prison, under the custody of Jia Furong (from Suqian), the head of the Second Special District Prison guard, and Wu Lu (from Yangzhou), the head of the Second Special Court Detention Center guard. Jia and Wu were bribed to allow Gu Zhuxuan to smoke opium in prison. In February of last year, inmates Li Heshang and Wang Arer reported this. After investigation by the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, Jia and Wu were prosecuted for dereliction of duty. As a result, they were each sentenced to five years in prison and five years of deprivation of civil rights. Jia and others appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, which rejected the appeal. Jia and others still refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. Now, after reviewing the entire case file, the Supreme Court has announced its verdict, stating that the original verdict regarding the crimes and punishments of Jia Furong and Wu Lu is revoked. Jia Furong and Wu Lu are each sentenced to five years in prison and five years of deprivation of civil rights for jointly shielding opium smoking. (Note: This is a change in the legal articles, but the initial verdict is still upheld.) The crimes of Jia, Wu, and others have been confirmed after three trials. Once the Supreme Court returns the case file to the Third Branch of the High Court, the appellants will be sent to prison to serve their sentences. After going through the legal process, there is no legal remedy, unless new evidence is discovered in the future, and a request for retrial is filed.</p>
<h3>Guangdong National Products Promotion Association Investigates Shanghai's National Products Industry</h3>
<p>The Guangdong, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi authorities are organizing a joint mobile exhibition of specialties from the four provinces to give compatriots a good understanding of these products. The exhibition recently held at the public sports field in the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou was a great success. After the exhibition in Guangzhou, it will be transported to Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi for rotation. The Guangzhou National Products Promotion Association plans to hold a national industrial exhibition of national products in Guangzhou to promote national products and expand their scope. Shou Moqing has been sent to Shanghai to contact manufacturers of national products. Liu Chenglong, director of the investigation department of the Guangdong National Products Promotion Association, is currently in Shanghai on business and is taking the opportunity to observe the recent state of Shanghai's national products industry and its industrial progress. He hopes that manufacturers of national products will actively participate in the national industrial exhibition in Guangzhou to stabilize the industry on a national basis and hopes that Shanghai's national products manufacturers and Guangdong's national products organizations will strengthen ties with each other, working together to actively expand the national national products industry.</p>
<h3>Animal Protection Association Building Release Garden</h3>
<p>The Garden is Located in Wusong and Occupies a Very Large Area; Appeals for Donations Due to Insufficient Construction Funds</p>
<p>The China Animal Protection Association has begun construction of the first release garden in Wusong. Funds for food and other supplies have already been secured, but construction funds are severely lacking. The association has issued the following fundraising appeal: "The Baoan Temple in Yanghang Town has 36 mu of land, and its abbot has vowed to lend it permanently to the China Animal Protection Association for the use of a release garden. The land is more than ten li from Shanghai, with convenient transportation by land and water. The Animal Protection Association has also purchased several mu of adjacent land to expand the garden to build the first release garden. In today's chaotic world, with people suffering and struggling to survive, people of ideals are rising up to discuss, plan, appeal, and run around to try to save the crisis and rescue the people from fire and water. But we are diligently working on the protection of animals. Some may argue that we are delaying what is urgent and hurrying what is slow. Is this really the case? Violence belongs to the present day, and goodness belongs to the future. Sages throughout history have expounded on this idea. However, what is meant by violence and goodness is not just the relationship between people. All sentient beings cherish their bodies and lives. But people use their strength and cunning to trap and abuse them, slaughter them for food. The cries of pain and pleas for life fill the empty air. The pitiful sight of animals facing death is everywhere. People see this as if they are unmoved. The world acts as if this is nothing strange, pushing the limits of cruelty. Is this not enough to destroy the world and exterminate the human race? The chairman of the European Vegetarian Society once said, 'If you want to stop bloodshed in the world, you should start by stopping bloodshed at the table.' This is a good solution for resolving the crisis in this chaotic world. The purpose of our association and the meaning of establishing this release garden is nothing more than this. The base for the garden has already been prepared, and the funds for animal feed in the future have also been secured, with funds allocated from the Buddhist Studies Bureau's release and Dharma propagation fund each year. What is lacking now is the funds for the construction and setup of the garden, which requires a considerable amount. We sincerely hope that kind-hearted people will fill their hearts with compassion, spread the fearless giving, and fulfill this special merit. Those who benefit will not only be the animals raised here but the whole world will be blessed by it."</p>

<h3>Cai Xuzhou Accused of Fraudulent Marriage, Assault, and Abortion</h3>
<p>Plaintiff is Cai's Concubine Shen Junya, Recounting the Deceptive Marriage</p>
<p>Cai Xuzhou (also known as Cai Huhu), the owner of Cai Xuji Construction Factory at No. 50, Lane 895, Xiaoshadu Road, has recently been sued by his concubine, Shen Junya, through a lawyer, to the Criminal Division of the First Special Court, accusing him of fraudulent marriage, bigamy, assault, and abortion. The indictment states: "The plaintiff is a traditional woman who lost her father at a young age and depended on her mother for survival. Unexpectedly, Cai Xuzhou, the owner of the Cai Xuji Construction Factory, who came from a Baоjia (local policing system) background, although approaching sixty years of age, still craved beauty. Seeing that the plaintiff possessed some beauty, he colluded with his second wife, Zhao Meizhen, to act as a matchmaker, falsely claiming that he was not yet thirty and that his first wife had passed away, and desired to marry the plaintiff as his wife to manage the household. At that time, the plaintiff's mother believed this to be true and readily agreed. Zhao Meizhen and Wang Jingchang acted as matchmakers, and they were married on the 23rd day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar in the 23rd year of the Republic of China at the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Edward VII. It was not until after entering the family that the plaintiff discovered that in addition to the legal wife, there was also a concubine named Lao Er, who had been there for twenty years. The plaintiff</p>
<p>discovered the deception</p>
<p>Thereafter, the plaintiff lamented her fate. However, Zhao Meizhen, because the defendant was unwilling to fulfill the conditions of helping with the fraudulent marriage, initially quarreled and then accused him of bigamy. At that time, the defendant, fearing conviction, coerced the plaintiff in every possible way to testify in court and admit to being a concubine. However, a few months after marrying the plaintiff, the defendant took another girl, Wang Jindi, who was only sixteen years old, as a concubine. He regarded the plaintiff as a thorn in his side,</p>
<p>verbally abusing and physically assaulting her</p>
<p>Moreover, he instigated Zhao Maosong and others to collude and falsely accuse the plaintiff of assault, hoping to subject the plaintiff to criminal punishment so that he could divorce her at will. Unexpectedly, before this case was resolved, his concubine Wang Jindi died from a forced abortion, and Wang's father filed a lawsuit against the defendant in the local court. As a result, the defendant was sentenced to one year and six months in prison. At that time, the defendant, with the cases of Zhao Meizhen and Wang Jindi</p>
<p>occurring one after another</p>
<p>lured the plaintiff back to live with him. Unexpectedly, the defendant was suffering from syphilis and transmitted the venereal disease to the plaintiff, causing her great suffering. Seeing that the plaintiff was pregnant, he forced her to have an abortion. The plaintiff, aware of Wang Jindi's death, dared not obey and was beaten again. Therefore, she had no choice but to file a lawsuit with the court, requesting that he be found guilty and punished for fraudulent marriage, assault,</p>
<p>and abortion under Articles 238, 285, and 291 of the Criminal Code." At 2:30 yesterday afternoon, Presiding Judge Fu Lin of the Eighth Criminal Division convened a hearing. The defendant Cai Xuzhou arrived in court with lawyers Chen Rui, Fan Gang, and Li Baosen. The plaintiff Shen Junya, due to illness, commissioned lawyer Shen Xingxia to submit a letter to the court requesting a postponement. Judge Fu then ordered that the case be rescheduled for a hearing on the afternoon of the 22nd.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Association Orders Correction of Temple Names</h3>
<p>Those That Worship Past Sages and Martyrs are Not Protected by Buddhist Laws</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association issued an order to abbots of temples in various locations, instructing them to correct names to conform to the original purpose of Buddhism. The order states, "It has been found that many Buddhist temples in various locations have names that do not conform to the teachings, or that the objects of worship are not Buddha or Bodhisattva images. This can easily lead to misunderstandings. In November of the 25th year [of the Republic], we issued Instruction No. 361, ordering all branch associations to investigate and correct these issues. However, upon reviewing submissions from various locations, we still see that old names are being used and have not been corrected, which is inappropriate. The scope of Buddhist temples, according to the Ministry of Interior's explanation to the provincial and municipal governments in the 9th month of the 25th year, is that 'the objects of worship in the temple belong to Buddhist figures, and only when monks and nuns reside there does it fall within the scope of Buddhist temples. If the objects of worship are past sages and martyrs, their nature is to venerate virtue and reward merit. This falls under the rules for the property of ancestral shrines and temples of past sages and martyrs. Temples are not included in the regulations for supervising temples.' Therefore, not only are lewd shrines and temples, and those that worship other gods and heretics, not Buddhist temples, but those that worship portraits of past sages and martyrs are also not Buddhist temples. Since they are not Buddhist temples, they are not protected by Buddhist laws. Therefore, the name of the temple and the objects of worship are the standards for determining whether it is a Buddhist temple, and this is extremely important. We hereby reiterate the previous order: If a temple is built and maintained by monks and nuns, but its name does not conform to the teachings, it should be corrected immediately. If the objects of worship are not Bodhisattva images, they should be replaced or added to (adding only refers to temples such as Guan Yu and Yue Fei, referring to Buddha and Bodhisattva images). A report should be submitted to the local administrative authorities and the affiliated branch association for record-keeping in order to comply with the law and avoid misunderstandings. If the corrections are not made, once an accident occurs, it will not be treated as a Buddhist temple, and our association will not be able to protect it. For example, the revised articles of the Eleventh Article of the Outline of Implementing Church Affairs and Popularizing Education in Hubei Province clearly stipulate that Buddhist temples are excluded, and the assets of other ancestral shrines and temples must contribute 60% to expand mandatory funding. Similarly, in Henan Province, the Niuwang Temple and Erlang Temple in Xixian County were designated as non-Buddhist temples by the County Education Bureau due to their non-compliant names, and their property was confiscated. Therefore, the name of the temple and the objects of worship are very important matters and should not be ignored. The branch associations have the responsibility to supervise and guide this matter and should conduct detailed inspections and strictly correct any issues. Do not treat this as a mere formality. This order is issued for compliance and implementation."</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Exchange Returns Special Security Deposits for Yarn and Cotton</h3>

The special security deposits for May and June will be canceled from today. The special security deposits for this month will still be collected as usual.

<h3>Chinese Accounting School Establishes Chinese Bookkeeping Method</h3>
<p>The Chinese Accounting Correspondence School, sponsored by the Chinese Accountant Firm on Gordon Road in this city, has been established for more than ten years and is the earliest correspondence school in Shanghai. All the professors are well-known accounting experts, so the school's achievements are outstanding. Students from all provinces have reached more than 4,000, and those as far away as Southeast Asia and Japan have also enrolled. The graduates of the school almost all hold accounting positions, and those who are accounting directors are too numerous to count. It is reported that the school's president, Accountant Shen Liren, in view of the lack of sound accounting methods in the business community and the difficulty in preparing various forms for income tax purposes, has added a "Practical Chinese Bookkeeping Method" lectures. The content is based on accounting principles and references to business practices, with detailed and clear examples. It has been tested by its clients and has been praised for its convenience and satisfaction. All business accounting staff and other staff need to participate in the study. Now the lecture notes have been printed, and correspondence courses will be officially launched in the near future. The number of people who have signed up to enroll are abnormally high. It is known that the tuition fee for the course is 10 yuan, and it can be paid in installments.</p>
<h3>Ice Factory Owner's Wife Commits Suicide After Being Raped</h3>
<p>Long-Term Worker Yuan Xiangqing's Crime is Unpardonable; Prosecutor's Investigation Clearly Leads to Indictment</p>
<p>—Yesterday's Hearing Postponed, Defendant Remanded—</p>
<p>Zeng Baoshan, who runs an ice factory at No. 7 Huangjia Wharf in Pudong, his wife, née Sun, was in the prime of her youth and quite upright. The couple's relationship was very harmonious. Zeng had a worker named Yuan Xiangqing, 27 years old, from Chongming, who was outwardly honest but inwardly deceitful, so he was quite trusted by the owner. On the 8th of last month, Zeng went across the river to Puxi on business, and only his wife, née Zeng Sun, was at home. Yuan Xiangqing was left to guard the ice factory. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>Yuan Xiangqing Took Advantage</p>
<p>On the afternoon of that day, around 1 p.m., he snuck into Zeng Sun's room and forcibly raped her. On the 10th, Zeng Baoshan returned home and found his wife crying inconsolably. After inquiring about what happened, he went out in a fit of anger. That evening, the woman, ashamed and resentful, committed suicide by slitting her throat with a razor. When Zeng Baoshan returned home and saw this, he sent her to Jiqun Hospital, but she died despite the treatment. The police arrested Yuan and</p>
<p>brought him to the local court</p>
<p>Prosecutor Lei Binzhang arrived to examine the body. According to Yuan Xiangqing's confession, he had committed adultery with the woman. However, in his madness, he claimed that it was consensual and claimed that he had had an affair with her since August of last year. When asked about the number of times they had been together, he claimed that he had only had intercourse three times from August of last year to March 8 of this year. The judge believed that the defendant</p>
<p>was an employee of the Zeng family</p>
<p>who lived in the ice factory for a long time. Adultery would have been very easy. For five months, would it have only happened three times? Even if an affair is secret, it would inevitably be revealed after a long time. How could there be such a situation? Therefore, he also inquired to the testimony of Long Gengsheng, another worker in the factory, who said that the Zeng Sun's wife has always been very upright, and no one has said any bad words about her. Therefore, the judge concluded that Sun had no illicit behavior, so once she was defiled,</p>
<p>she committed suicide out of anger. The prosecutor also stated in the indictment after a clear investigation, "If that were not the case, her husband was not at home on the 8th of this month, and only the woman was at home. Yuan Xiangqing was her employee, and there was no suspicion when he came and went. After the continued adultery, no one knew. Yuan Xiangqing would not reveal it himself, and the woman could even hide it. Why would she cry to her husband and make up a rape to reveal the secret? Moreover, Yuan Xiangqing confessed to raping Zeng Sun's wife on the 8th of this month. What he argued was to force the ear with harmony. He claimed that on that day, the woman wanted</p>
<p>to sleep with the defendant</p>
<p>and the defendant refused. He also claimed that she wanted to sleep with him, so he slept with her. It is not unusual for a woman to refuse a man's rape, but it is rare for a woman to force a man's rape. Since he had already refused, he slept with her again. The confession is implausible. If it were really as he said, then Zeng Sun's wife would be extremely shameless. What would a shameless woman not do? Why would she commit suicide to prove herself? It is clear that the defendant, after the incident, tried to minimize his crime and disguised the force with harmony. It is even more hateful that he raped while alive and slandered her after death. The defendant has committed</p>
<p>rape under Article 221, Paragraph 1</p>
<p>of the Criminal Code (which is punishable by seven years of imprisonment) and the crime under Article 226, Paragraph 2 (causing the raped person to commit suicide out of shame, punishable by life imprisonment or seven years or more of imprisonment). He has filed a public prosecution with the criminal court, requesting that he be severely punished. Yesterday, Judge Bai Dongling opened the court. The defendant hired lawyer Gong Chuyin, who still argued for consensual sexual relations. The palace, due to the following questions and answers related to public morality, prohibited the audience from attending. As a result, the hearing was postponed and the defendant was remanded to custody."</p>
<h3>Qian Sujun Lectures on Income Tax</h3>
<p>The Lixin Accounting Society recently invited Mr. Qian Sujun to lecture on the problem of income tax and accounting methods. Mr. Qian is a professor of accounting at Shanghai Jiao Tong and Jinan Universities, as well as a practicing accountant. In this lecture, he first elaborated on the accounting methods of cash-basis and accrual-basis, as well as the theoretical review of income tax taxation. Then, he gave a clear analysis and critique of China's current income tax and accounting methods. The audience was all moved. It is heard that the Society will also invite Lawyer and Accountant Li Wenjie and Accountant Li Hongshou to continue to give lectures on income tax issues.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of County Land Tax Begins to be Levied on Schedule</h3>
<p>Outstanding Land Taxes Must be Paid Off by a Deadline</p>
<p>After Shanghai County changed the land tax to a land value tax in the 25th year [of the Republic], the first phase of collection has expired. Now, under the supervision of the county government, the Land Administration Bureau has expedited the assessment of the value of urban land and special land in the county in accordance with the law and has ordered the Land Tax Collection Office to prepare for the commencement of the second phase of collection. It is now scheduled to begin on the 15th of this month. For all households with outstanding land taxes and unpaid first-phase land value taxes for the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th years [of the Republic], the deadline was the end of March. An investigation has revealed that there are still some who have not paid. Therefore, it is ordered that all land tax commissioners supervise and urge the collection clerks to clear the payments by the deadline. Severe punishment will be given to any further delays.</p>
<h3>Mongolia-Suiyuan Painting Exhibition Welcomes Student Groups</h3>
<p>The Mongolia-Suiyuan Sketch Painting Exhibition, which opened yesterday, was visited by a continuous stream of people at the Great World Department Store. Westerners accounted for about one-third of the visitors and paid special attention to the specimens and photographs on display. A total of 1,000 people visited throughout the day, including some who came from Beijing and Hangzhou, demonstrating their concern for national defense and art. The painting "Around the Lama," on display for the second time, was purchased by a Westerner. According to Mr. Shen Yiqian, the organizer, the purpose of the exhibition is to publicize the border crisis and promote national consciousness. School student groups of 20 or more are admitted free of charge, but only in the morning. It is also reported that the Ximen branch of the China Travel Service in this city, in sympathy with the exhibition and for the convenience of the audience, will sell tickets for the painting exhibition from today.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Telephone Bureau Discovers Genuine and Fake Bill Collectors</h3>
<p>Forty-eight forged receipts confiscated</p>
<p>Yesterday at 12:00 noon, Chen Fanghe, a bill collector from the Zhabei Telephone Bureau, was collecting monthly telephone fees at Qianyi Steel Refinement Factory on Xinlu East, Qiujiang Road. He suddenly discovered that someone had already collected fees at the factory. The factory could not distinguish between the genuine and the fake for a moment. Upon inspecting the receipts for telephone fees, the forged ones were indistinguishable from the real ones. However, Chen, the bill collector, knew that the bureau had no such person collecting fees, so he secretly knew that it must be a fraud. He then reported it to Du Jinxiang, police officer No. 32 at the Zhongxing Road police station of the Xinzha Police Branch. The fake bill collector was apprehended at the scene. Upon questioning, he confessed his name was Zhou Yaozhong, 33 years old, from Pudong, with no fixed address. He readily admitted to fraudulently collecting monthly telephone fees, having already collected a total of twenty yuan from Fei Xingfa, a slaughterhouse, and Fukang Rice Store. Two yuan and one jiao in newly minted auxiliary coins, a ten-yuan note from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and forty-eight forged telephone fee receipts were confiscated from the suspect and sent to the Xinzha Branch for investigation.</p>
<h3>Runaway Wife Unwilling to Return Home</h3>
<p>Huang Bingxing, 22 years old, a cement worker from Laosha Village, Yintang, Pudong, was betrothed by his parents in his youth to Ren, 19 years old, daughter of Ren Sihai from Yangsi Township. Due to poverty, they forcibly married two years ago. Last April, Ren, unable to endure poverty, came to Shanghai to work as a helper at Mo's residence at 793 Zhonghua Road. Huang searched for her without success, feeling helpless. Unexpectedly, yesterday, Ren accompanied her employer to Zhoujiadu, Pudong, to sweep graves and was seen by Huang. Finding her where he had been searching in vain, he dragged her to the Zhoujiadu Police Station and sent her to the Yangsi District Police Station. Patrol Officer Xiao Jingfu questioned her and learned that she was supporting herself by working as a helper and had done nothing improper, but she was unwilling to follow this impoverished and fierce husband. Huang insisted on mending their broken marriage. Therefore, he was ordered to be sent to the Tangqiao Police Station for verification.</p>
<h3>Wang Gongxing's Wife Requests Confirmation of Divorce Agreement as Invalid</h3>
<p>Hearing Adjourned Yesterday for Further Investigation</p>
<p>Wang Gongxing, a native of Ningbo, currently serving as the Chinese Vice Consul in Chicago, USA, is 29 years old. His residence in Shanghai is No. 42, Modele Village, Foch Road. He is the nephew of Wang Zhengting, the current Ambassador to the United States. Two years ago, he married Zhou Jingwan (31 years old this year), a woman from the same hometown, in Shanghai. They are now divorced. Zhou resides at No. 24, Lane 467, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, near Attorney Chen Maoxuan, who is representing her in filing a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Special Second Court against Wang Gongxing, requesting confirmation that the divorce agreement is invalid. According to her statement, in May of the 24th year of the Republic of China, she married the defendant Wang Gongxing through the introduction of relatives and friends. Not long after their honeymoon, the defendant was dispatched by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to serve as Vice Consul in Chicago, USA. The plaintiff accompanied him and lived together. The couple's feelings were initially very affectionate. However, after the defendant entered officialdom, his environment changed. He became arrogant with his high position and abundant wealth. His social circle expanded, and all his contacts were officials and gentry. Therefore, after a long time of being influenced, he despised the plaintiff and discarded her like an autumn fan. However, because he could not abandon the plaintiff immediately overseas, he created trouble and arguments arose from time to time. He had other thoughts early on and had a plan in mind. In July of the 25th year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff planned to return to China to visit her family, but the defendant repeatedly obstructed her and deliberately refused. The two sides then clashed. Later, the defendant claimed that returning to China required signing a temporary separation agreement for a period of one year to restore their relationship. The plaintiff believed that China and the United States were separated by a vast ocean, and round trips would take time. Moreover, one year would pass quickly. To avoid further mental abuse, she agreed generously. Taking advantage of the plaintiff's deep stimulation and excessive drinking, which led to mental disorder, the defendant presented a document that had been pre-typed in English and had the plaintiff sign it. At the time, she did not suspect anything else and was deceived into signing it. No third person knew about it at the time. Unexpectedly, after the plaintiff returned to China, letters were often sent, and months later, the document was sent, only to realize that it was a divorce paper. It was also discovered that Wang Gongsheng and Zhang Wenqi had signed as witnesses. Therefore, she specifically filed a lawsuit requesting the court to confirm that this type of divorce agreement was invalid, etc. The court, according to the statement, yesterday morning, Judge Li Liang presided over the trial in the Civil Seventh Court. The plaintiff arrived with her lawyer and stated the previous situation. The defendant was still in the United States and appointed Attorney Wu Kaisheng to represent him, stating that the defendant was far away in the United States and, as a civil and personnel litigation lawyer, he could represent him without the need for the defendant to appear in court in person. The plaintiff claimed that the defendant's presence was required and that, since the case involved divorce, representatives could not be requested for the marriage, and Attorney Wu could not represent the defendant himself. Therefore, she requested the court to order the defendant to appear in person and summon the witnesses on the divorce agreement for questioning. Judge Li stated that the case could not be decided based on one-sided statements and required further investigation. He then announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 20th for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Trafficking in Poison Pills Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Guo Chenhao, a Chinese detective from the Narcotics Division of the Public Concession Police, learned on the morning of the day before yesterday, at 11:15 am, that someone was using red pills as a substitute for opium in a flat near Weiduoma Road and Yangzhou Road to satisfy their addiction. He then collaborated with Western detective Ke Erchi to apprehend the main suspect Dai Changren from Jiangbei, and drug users Zhou Xiaoqing and Gao Ziliang at the address. Thirty-four poison pills were confiscated. According to Dai's confession, these red pills were purchased from a Nanjing woman, Zhou Wang, in a thatched hut on Longjiang Road. The detectives then went to apprehend Zhou, who was also brought to the Yulin Road Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special First Court. Attorney Zhang Tianyin from the police station stated that the defendant Zhou Wang had been selling poison pills for profit for more than half a year. However, she denied it at the police station and requested a postponement. Judge Dai questioned each defendant once, and the rest were sent back into custody and rescheduled for further verification.</p>

<h3>Southeast Hospital Accused of Disregarding Human Life</h3>
<p>Hearing Adjourned Yesterday, Defendant Released on Bail; Order to Send Child's Corpse for Examination</p>
<p>Huang Kaifeng, nearly fifty years old, currently serving as the adjutant director of the 39th Army stationed in Shanghai, at 282 South City Outer Bund Road, had only one son, named Chunsheng, six years old. Recently, due to illness, he was sent to the Southeast Hospital of the Shanghai Military Camp in South City for treatment. After diagnosis, the hospital gave him medicine powder. Less than half an hour after taking it, the child's eyes became wide and blank, his hands clenched, his abdomen cramped, and he died of suffocation. Huang was grief-stricken and filed a lawsuit with the local court, accusing Xu Guojun, Chen Zhuoren, and others in charge of the hospital of disregarding human life and causing his son's death due to misdiagnosing his condition. The prosecutor investigated and ordered that the child's corpse, Huang Chunsheng, be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination. The defendant was ordered to be released on bail, and the matter would be further investigated based on the results of the institute's examination report.</p>

<h3>Ma Rongbao and Son Drowned in the Pu River</h3>
<p>Ma Rongbao, a 47-year-old boatman from Shandong, boat number 842 in the Pu River, worked as a lamplighter at the Dinghai Bridge Fish Market. On the evening of the first of this month, Ma and his son Fu'an (15 years old) went to the floating docks on the Pu River as usual to place lights. They did not return that night. Until 8:00 am on the second, his friend Tian Zhicheng went to look for them and saw that the lights on Ma's boat were not extinguished, but Ma and his son were nowhere to be found. Ma's father searched everywhere, but it remained a mystery. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, Ma's corpse suddenly floated up below the ferry dock in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong. After the customs water police retrieved it, they informed the father of the corpse, who identified it as Ma without error. It was confirmed that Ma and his son had both drowned in the Pu River. However, the cause of the drowning remains unknown. The police chief then ordered Detective Li Wenqi to take the corpse to the South City Rescue Bureau yesterday morning. The local court appointed Prosecutor Ma to examine the body, confirming that it was a drowning and ordering the corpse's father, Ma Zhaofeng, to prepare a coffin for burial.</p>
<h3>Female Waitress and Beauty Zhang Afeng's Marriage Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Hearing Concluded Yesterday, Judgment Scheduled</p>
<p>Zhang Afeng, a 22-year-old waitress at the Number One Tea House of the Daxin Company Amusement Park, is a native of Ningbo and currently resides at No. 119 Da Tong Road. She is exceptionally beautiful and is the most popular female waitress in the company. Therefore, she is ranked first. Tourists flock to her, and she can earn as much as fifty or sixty yuan on Saturdays and Sundays. Her reputation is immense. Zeng Rongzhang, who runs a soy sauce garden, fell in love with her. The wedding ceremony was held on December 8th of last year. However, good things are often fraught with difficulties. Zhang Afeng has a first husband in her hometown, Shi Lianfa, who is ugly and poor. They married in the 24th year of the Republic of China. How can a toad ever taste swan meat? It is said that Zhang Afeng ran away shortly after the marriage. Recently, she was found and sued in the local court. After an investigation by Prosecutor Tang Ruxiu, Zhang Afeng did not acknowledge the marriage relationship with Shi. However, Shi presented evidence, and the prosecutor charged Zhang Afeng with bigamy. Zeng Rongzhang was not guilty because he was unaware of the situation. Yesterday, Judge Xiang opened the court for trial. Zhang Afeng hired Attorney Chen Xingmin and claimed that she used to work in Ningbo and was seduced by Shi, who exaggerated his family's wealth and claimed to have no wife. Therefore, she had an affair with him. Later, her father searched for her every day, so she returned home and broke off contact with Shi. Later, she came to Shanghai to work as a waitress and married Zeng at the Shen Rong Lou Restaurant on Haining Road. Shi fabricated a story and first accused her at the police station. Fortunately, the police saw through the deception and ignored it. Therefore, he then filed a lawsuit, purely for extortion. The court also questioned Zeng Rongzhang, who confessed that he married Zhang without knowing the situation. Finally, Shi Lianfa confessed everything. The court announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment for the 15th.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Advance Payment for Dance Hall</h3>
<p>Liu Anren, a 37-year-old native of Ningbo residing at No. 17 Shizi Lane, Jiumudi, has been in the dance hall business for a long time. Last month, he rented the hall of the Da Huhu Hotel on Edward Road, Dongxin Bridge, to open the New Da Huhu Dance Hall. He appointed himself as the manager and opened for business on the 20th of last month. During the opening, he hired Fang Ganghong (27 years old), a fellow townsman residing at No. 5 Shangde Lane, Weiqi Zhong Road, Avenue Joffre, to serve as an assistant, agreeing to have Fang advance 300 yuan. Both parties agreed to deduct 60 yuan from the nightly ticket sales as repayment of the advance. Fang began advancing the money on March 16th and advanced a total of 443.95 yuan by the time of the opening. However, Liu did not repay Fang's advance as agreed from the nightly ticket sales. After repeated reminders, Liu continued to delay indefinitely. Fang believed that Liu was engaging in fraudulent behavior and recently learned that Liu was about to flee due to debt. Therefore, he reported it to the French police the night before, and they dispatched detectives to arrest Liu. Yesterday, he was sent to the Criminal Eighth Court of the Second Special Court. Attorney Fei Xizhen from the Police Affairs Office requested a postponement of the investigation. Attorney Ma Lewu, representing the plaintiff, filed an incidental civil suit seeking to recover the defrauded advance payment. Attorney Zhu Dianxiang defended the defendant. After a brief questioning by the court, it was announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 16th for further questioning. The defendant was remanded in custody and not allowed bail.</p>
<h3>Zhu Zuotong Acquitted of Embezzlement Charges</h3>
<p>Zhu Zuotong, general manager of the Huamei Evening News on Edward Road, and Wu Bannong, director of the general management office, were recently accused of embezzlement by Zhang Xiuzhe from Fujian in the First Special District Court. The court had previously summoned them for questioning. The case was further heard yesterday afternoon by Judge Zhan Liangce in the Criminal Ninth Court. Zhu Zuotong and Wu Bannong both arrived on time to defend themselves, stating that the plaintiff invested 2,500 yuan in the Huamei Evening News, with 500 yuan as share capital and 2,000 yuan as a loan. On February 2nd of this year, the plaintiff served as the director of the translation department in this office. However, his conditions were harsh, and his salary demands were too high, so he resigned on the 25th. This matter is actually of a civil nature and not a personal matter. Now the plaintiff has rashly filed a criminal lawsuit, so we request that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed, etc. After questioning by Judge Zhan, he ruled that the plaintiff's claim could not be established and declared Zhu Zuotong and Wu Bannong not guilty. The plaintiff's incidental civil suit was dismissed.</p>

<h3>Why So Many Exposed Corpses?</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>"Behind the vermilion gates, meat and wine go to waste; on the roads lie the bones of those who have frozen to death." This is a picture of the society at that time, depicted by a great poet of the Tang Dynasty. Although only "ten characters," it completely exposes the main crux of society at that time! This is quite similar to the current situation where large amounts of coffee and wheat are dumped into the sea, while tens of millions of starving people sob and swallow in the cold. Of course, the latter situation is even more tragic than the former.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department released a "very noteworthy piece of news": according to the Health Department's records, among the 1,300 Chinese deaths in the Concession in February, as many as 626 were exposed corpses, accounting for 48 percent. The main causes of death were tuberculosis, heart disease, pneumonia, typhoid fever, cerebral congestion...</p>
<p>Who can say that Shanghai is not magnificent and splendid in appearance? People from the countryside yearn to come to Shanghai, believing that Shanghai is a "golden land," a place where they can eat and use endlessly. Therefore, like a raging tide, they surge from the bankrupt countryside.</p>
<p>However, what happens after they come?</p>
<p>The reality that is given to them is completely the opposite of what they imagined in the countryside. They have no choice but to die on the road and become "wild ghosts."</p>
<p>Of course, the "wild ghosts" I am talking about are not entirely "country bumpkins" from the countryside. However, among those 626 exposed corpses, wouldn't there be "country bumpkins" who have a strong desire for Shanghai? They would probably account for a relatively large number in that figure!</p>
<p>But regardless of whether the deceased are "country bumpkins" or "Shanghai natives," we can see from the main causes of death how desperately those who died struggled with their environment for a bowl of rice before they died! However, they could not avoid diseases such as tuberculosis, heart disease, pneumonia, typhoid fever, and cerebral congestion, which could have been cured. However, because of poverty, they had no choice but to "not care about the diseases" and die on the bustling streets of Shanghai, becoming pitiful exposed corpses!</p>
<p>Shanghai is prosperous, the Paris of the East! However, within it, the evil bacteria of diseases such as tuberculosis, heart disease, pneumonia, typhoid fever, and cerebral congestion are rotting away the physique of Shanghai!</p>
<h3>On Daming Lake</h3>
<p>— Ma Feng</p>
<p>It was just when the sun was setting in the west, and also summer, making Daming Lake appear even more beautiful. Reeds grew everywhere, obscuring people's view. Someone seeing it for the first time might think—</p>
<p>"Daming Lake is truly not small; you can't see the edge! What Liu Tieyun said in *The Travels of Lao Ts'an* about the lake taking up half the city is no exaggeration at all."</p>
<p>I don't know whose lotus flowers, lotus leaves, and seedpods filled the pond, covering the water's surface. The fragrance of the lotus flowers floated in the air, making people reluctant to move once they stood there. Willows grew neatly on the opposite bank, their heads hanging low enough to touch the water's surface. The ancient city walls sat lifelessly far across the way.</p>
<p>As we approached the dock where boats were moored, the boatmen surrounded us:</p>
<p>"Want to take a stroll? How about a tour of the whole lake? It's quite cool on the lake at this time!"</p>
<p>We didn't answer, pretending to stroll around the dock, but the boatmen stuck to us, repeatedly pitching their business. We asked how much it would cost to tour the whole lake.</p>
<p>The boatmen became even more energetic, gesticulating as they said:</p>
<p>"Sir, tell me if this is cheap or not—one dollar and fifty cents, for three people, to tour the whole lake: Tie Gong Temple, Lixia Pavilion, Beiji Temple, Zhang Gong Temple—all of them!"</p>
<p>"Get out of here! Your price is completely outrageous!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the boatman automatically lowered the price—one dollar. But we only offered sixty cents. As we turned to leave, we settled on a price of eighty cents. The one rowing the boat turned out to be an old man. We were surprised—why wasn't the young man coming? The boatman replied:</p>
<p>"Sir, although he was the one who negotiated the price with you, it's my shift, so I have to do it! If business isn't slow, we wouldn't make any money like this; that's why this rule was established! Alas, if business wasn't slow, how could you tour the whole lake for eighty cents!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, he poled the water, and the boat left the shore and headed into the lake. As we drank tea, we looked around at the scenery; the old boatman then opened his chatterbox, as if telling of his suffering would make him feel better.</p>
<p>"Business is slow, the times are bad, sir, don't you think?" We nodded. "That's absolutely right! When Zhang Zongchang was here, we couldn't see less than ten or twenty dollars a day! But now it's impossible. If we see one or two dollars a day, we consider it a good business—it's often the case that we have no business at all. Perhaps the gentlemen haven't noticed, but on West Gate Street, Governor's Street, and at the foot of the Examination Hall walls, we send many people to wait for business!</p>
<p>Listening to the old boatman, I remembered being asked on those streets: "Going to tour the lake?"</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Going to Quehua Bridge?" "...", I thought this was very strange. Just because people are walking there, does that mean they're going to tour Daming Lake? Can you tell just by looking at them if someone is going to tour the lake? I asked the old boatman these questions—</p>
<p>"...Sir, although you can't tell, and not everyone who comes here is necessarily going to tour the lake, what other good ideas do we have when business is slow! It's always better to have someone calling out on the street than to have no one at all... Last year, the gentlemen at the Education Hall said that in order to make Daming Lake more lively and give us more business, they wanted us boatmen to have a competition, but what happened? Alas, nothing! Like a blind donkey pushing a millstone, going around and around—still 'alas, still no business'!"</p>
<p>The boat reached Lixia Pavilion. We got off the boat and took a stroll. Lixia Pavilion is a lucky place on the lake. It's very well-maintained, because famous people often come here to host visiting dignitaries. But there's not much to see.</p>
<p>After touring Beiji Temple, the boat headed west toward Tie Gong Temple. The sky had already turned from yellowish dusk to darkness. The surrounding scenery blurred. There was no moon or stars, it was dark and heavy, as if it was about to rain. The streetlights on the city walls and roads emitted feeble light. We walked in the middle of the . Every now and then, we saw glittering things in the reeds, and they were moving—painting Daming Lake in the moonless night even more beautifully.</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>I was also very surprised. It was my first time touring Daming Lake at night—there were many of these things flying in the reeds. The old boatman told us—</p>
<p>"Fireflies."</p>
<p>"Fireflies!"</p>
<p>We repeated the word. "Ah! It's so beautiful!"</p>
<p>The foreign coin decorations on the boat awning made a very light, slow sound—it had started to rain.</p>
<h3>Wife's Nightly Letter</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>Spring is more than halfway over, and the night is stifling and restless. The wind blows the street trees, devoid of rural charm, causing them to rustle like sand being stirred. Two or three cuckoo cries drift from the dark sky, desolate and barren, like the distant sound of temple bells at sunset: from it, one senses the boundless vastness and eternity of the universe, and the smallness and pitifulness of one's own life and wisdom.</p>
<p>Standing forlorn in those desolate regions, separated from this life by an almost unimaginably distant loneliness— a heart filled with restlessness and unease, one seems always to be eagerly anticipating something, but these things are distant, vague, blurred, and intangible. The weight of the years presses down on one's body; thus, in distant dreams, one may see some faces of the past (only at this time does the shadow of time slightly lessen its weight!). Then, one wakes up—wakes up to a deep black night, finding oneself ten or twenty years older in the blink of an eye. The stains of insult and harm in life are like photographic paper in the developing solution under a dark red light, slowly, from gray-white and hazy, from hazy to clear and profound, finally becoming a distinct picture—a picture that can never be erased.</p>
<p>In this wearing away of humanity's joys and sorrows by time, perhaps you have similar experiences and feelings? But what can be blamed on me is only my incompetence. The sorrowful night is as rich and concentrated as sweet poisoned wine. These times are cruel for me, not only because no one remembers me anymore, but also because I don't have the good fortune to remember others. So day after day, I seem like a sleepwalker walking alone in a birch forest at night. In this richly concentrated and desolate late night, I need to release my suffocated breath; I need to see lives of my own kind; I need to see "people" who can respond to my laughter, weeping, love, and indignation. I finally feel a growing disturbance and anxiety in my heart, as if a wild beast is trapped in a cage, cutting off one's heart from nature with iron bars, also like a turbulent fountain (I have seen turbulent fountains, and how much I longed for that boiling, majestic appearance!) incessantly pouring into still, dead water. Finally, even that dead water can no longer maintain its tranquility, and it becomes agitated, with specks of foam, and may even boil. I think that dead water is suffering—because it is being moved and disturbed.</p>
<p>Blame me for my incompetence—because I remember; the cruel and unbelievable life makes me bury my head and clench my teeth, but I, I, also have all the innate needs of humanity. I demand to live on—because I am also a "person," and is life, you believe, a sin? - And each desolate night burns in one's heart, making me afraid to predict how long these days will last. Slowly, a person becomes too close to oneself, trusts it too much, and sees it as too sublime and great. So, in the endless desolate night, I abandoned Schopenhauer and picked up Nietzsche. Devouring them madly, a spark of noble self-strength flashes between the pages. I was captivated by it—however, I am still lonely; I only hope that the dark sky has just a little bit of starlight, or that the wilderness has just a few faint human voices (not to mention a bright sun outside the window!), I would immediately throw Nietzsche far away and rush towards the windy fields, towards the stars, towards the distant</p>
<p>Thus, just like a dead spring, after being disturbed, it also slowly produces weak splashes of water. I listen attentively, attentively, to the dark sky, where one or two faint stars glimmer like faint light; in the distance, there are faint human voices like whispers in a dream. I burn, rejoice, and even feel grateful, as if those stars and human voices were specially sent to heal my desolate wounds; I run wildly to the broken threshold and open the door wide. But! It's so dark outside! I am at a loss...</p>
<p>Why say that—yes, to say that is almost shameless. What can be blamed is only my incompetence, a fox is always a fox!</p>
<p>But, I finally threw Nietzsche far away—not to look down on him, but to avoid slandering him!</p>
<p>I won't say anything more. The stars faded away like shooting arrows, and in the desolate night, human voices floated away like poetry, like an elevated dream, but from this dream, I saw myself.</p>
<p>It's a nightmare!</p>
<h3>"Vagabond's Diary" Published</h3>
<p>"Vagabond's Diary", written by the foremost Japanese female writer Fumiko Hayashi, is a true record of the life of a Japanese woman struggling in a capitalist society. The author's own life experience is very rich. She wandered as a maid, a female clerk in a small shop, a female worker in a factory, a waitress in a coffee shop, and even set up a small stall in the Tokyo night market. Therefore, her words are filled with cries of grief from within. The book includes six chapters: ㊀ Before Vagabond's Diary (author's autobiography), ㊁ Prostitutes and Hotels, ㊂ Dare to Erase the Goal, ㊃ Red Slippers, ㊄ Female Rogue, ㊅ Hachiyama Inn, etc. After the book was published, it caused an unprecedented reaction in Japanese literary circles. It was praised as the "Song of the Eastern Female Gypsy," and the number of copies sold as a single volume reached dozens of editions. Now, the book has been translated into Chinese by Mr. Cui Wanqiu. Mr. Cui's fluent and expressive writing style is well-known to readers. The publisher is Qiming Bookstore at No. 400 Sima Road. It is said that the price is only twenty cents per volume.</p>
