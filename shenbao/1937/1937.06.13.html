<h3>孔財長闡明我國國債政策</h3>
<p>願借低利外債整理內債　建設事業歡迎友邦合作</p>
<p>［柏林］中國行政院副院長兼財政部長孔祥煕博士今日接見“德意志總彙報”訪員、發表關於中國外債政策之重要宣言、孔氏首先指陳、謂各國對於中國政府及國民黨以及全國人民協力完成之偉大工作、當一致公認殆無疑義、此項事實、渠可藉此行告慰各友邦、而自引為欣慰者也、繼稱中國人民現將國內一切安排就緒、歡迎所有其他國家帮助合作、在友誼之競爭中、共謀“新中國”之建設、孔氏繼對中國外債政策詳加闡述、指陳國際資本市塲之現勢、極利於發行借欵、而中國之經濟發展、適利於外國資本之投資、並以政府之海關歲入、為至上之担保、今年海關收入、最少在四五○•○○○•○○○銀元以上、而外債担保者僅一○○•○○○•○○○銀元、內債亦不過二○○•○○○•○○○銀元、故尚有一萬五千萬元可為借欵之担保也、</p>
<p>其次孔氏鄭重聲稱、中國再舉惜外債之目的、并非用於建築鐵路或開辦實業、乃限於接受長期貸欵、而為購買材料之用、若為穩定中國貨幣、則中國可勿須外國資本、但要尋求－種合理之投資、使國內貨幣同時亦保持平衡、則殊非易易也、孔氏繼提及最近數年發行國內公價之成功、宜稱、中國政府當遵循以往路線繼續努力、以求鐵路制度及實業之建立、并力求完全不用債欵自力發展、孔稱接稱、“中國準備接受外國低息之借欵以改變其高利之內債、按照金融及資本市塲之現狀、顯然有如此進行之機會、”中國現有內債共約二十萬萬元、利息為週息六釐、惟以發售價低之故、利息可抵八釐、如倘能以週息四釐借得外債、則政府每年息金節省八千萬元、卽可用之於振興實業矣、孔氏最後指陳、中國國內之團結、交通網及實業之建立以及對外貿易之增加、並軍事上剿共之成功、謂共黨所盤據區域極其渺小云、最後孔氏鄭重宣稱、“中國政府之外交政策可以一言以蔽之、卽願與世界各民族抱同樣政策及原則者和平合作”云、（十二日國民海通電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>蘇聯之軍事叛國案</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>前日蘇聯最高法院軍事法庭審理杜加契夫斯基等八將領的叛國案。結果因罪狀昭著。各被告亦均供認不諱。遂一律判處死刑。這事件為繼續去夏齊維諾夫加門尼失案及今春拉狄克案以來的又一大案。但其重要性則又超過於前者。據昨報塔斯社所傳消息。被告等之罪狀。包括“受對蘇聯邦交不睦某國軍事情報機關雇用。系統地以秘密消息供給某國軍界。實行破壞手段。以削弱工農紅軍威力。準備於蘇聯被攻時使紅軍戰敗。並蓄意援助瓜分蘇聯及恢復地主及資本家在蘇聯之勢力。”這種種。較齊加及拉狄克等之叛黨事件。當然更為嚴重。違軍叛國。不但在蘇聯為極罪。卽在任何其他國家亦均死有餘辜也。</p>
<p>但在世界各國的眼光中。如此大案自必引起不小的驚訝。尤其因為此次被判的八人。都是蘇聯紅軍的高級將領。而德日兩國報紙。更乘此機會。發出關於蘇聯國防力削弱的論調。似乎此次事件。對於蘇聯確有相當的不利的。然而有着這種不利的可能。為什麽蘇聯當局仍不得已而出此呢。這確是我們注意國際情勢者一個值得研究的題目。因此筆者願就管見所及。對此案件略作客觀的評析。</p>
<p>第一。我們覺得此次案件。與蘇聯的對外政策。不無關係。按這次杜氏等被判的罪狀。其第一項卽提到他們受某一對蘇聯不睦國家的軍事情報機關之雇用。就是顯著的證明。這所謂某國。指的是誰。一般人都能明瞭的。照目前國際情勢。日本進攻蘇聯可能較少。而歐洲某國對於蘇聯的威脅實大。目前波蘭報紙所傳消息。謂德蘇關係。最近似有重趨緩和的可能。尤其因為德國國防軍方面。一向是主張聯俄的。但這消息立刻被莫斯科官方所否認。我們從旁觀察。覺得這消息有幾種作用。第一。它當是德方故意放出。用以離間法蘇的。第二。據說杜加契夫斯基與德國軍方。關係素稱良好。由此推測。則最近杜氏或確有親德之主張。但蘇聯政策。决於中樞。而目前蘇聯當局對歐的政策。則為堅决維持法蘇互助協定之和平路綫。由於杜氏認識上的錯誤。他或者有陷於敵人挑撥的可能而這種錯誤。卽足以造成了叛國殺身之禍。</p>
<p>第二。此次案件。也可以顯出蘇聯的以黨治軍的特點。軍事受黨的指導。而黨則以國家的大綱政策為依歸。這種政策可以隨着客觀環境而隨時修正的。最近一二年來。蘇聯鑒於侵略者威脅的嚴重。努力於擴展軍備。這時期對於軍人的指導或有比較寬縱之處。於是少數軍人因政治認識的錯誤。或個人野心的作祟。遂鑄成叛黨賣國的大錯。上月蘇聯軍區管理制的改革。卽為集中軍事統制力的先聲。隨此而來的。卽有杜氏等的貶職遷調。加麥尼克的畏罪自殺蛛絲馬跡。可見以政治力量肅軍的着着進行。而杜氏等因政治上的錯誤及個人墮落終不免伏罪受誅。但在此期間。軍事人員之調動。完全依政治的指揮而順利進行。於此可見蘇聯軍隊之政治的戰鬥力。確為一特點。</p>
<p>自然。此次蘇聯大案的最根本原因。還是由於軍事的叛國。愛國者應受國法保護。叛國者應受嚴重裁判。這是任何國家的公理。不獨蘇聯為然。我們對於杜氏等的伏誅。應作如是觀。</p>

<p>條陳政府說明理由</p>
<p>［華盛頓］經濟委員會今日向美政府提出條陳主張廢止購銀法、謂繼續以高價購銀、藉以津貼美國銀礦、實無理由、卽置金融關係於石頭、此類合法化之津貼政策實不足取、何況對於國家貨幣之安定影響甚大也云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯叛國案八將領執行槍决</h3>

<p>［莫斯科］今日國防委員伏羅希洛夫大將以特別令文致紅軍、發表判處死刑之軍事領袖杜嘉契夫斯基大將等八人、已悉執行槍决並稱、政府與蘇維埃軍事參議會於六月一日起舉行特會、至六月四日止、渠曾在會提出關於杜氏等組織叛國反革命軍事法西斯團之報告、而由內務委員破獲杜氏所犯之罪、為㊀以情報售與某法西斯國、㊁努力促成反蘇維埃戰事、㊂謀於戰時阻撓戰品運往前綫、㊃謀攫蘇聯之政權、而將烏克蘭割予德國、令文結語勸勉將士奮發天良、效忠陸軍、俾彌補叛徒加於國家之損夫、（中央社十三日日路透社電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］蘇聯人民國防委員長伏洛希洛夫元帥發表文告、文云、“蘇聯人民國防委員會軍事參議會於六月一日至四日開會、政府要員列席、會中曾聆取並討論余之報告、係關於人民內政委員會所破獲之賣國反革命軍人法西斯蒂組織、該組織係屬絕對陰謀性質、業已成立甚久、曾在紅軍內部建立進行破壞間諜工作之根據地、紅軍今聞法院對各叛徒已作公正判决、並執行應得之刑罰、此後當可高枕無憂、蘇維埃法院之公正地嚴懲特羅資基齊諾維夫派恐怖主義者•別動隊•間諜•及暗殺犯、此非首次、彼輩叛徒在出賣工農的卑污的法西斯蒂奸賊特羅資基指揮之下、利用外國情報機關之金錢、進行其賣國的活動、”</p>
<p>此後該公告指出直至最近方被破獲之賣國奸徒中、亦有在紅軍中建立巢穴之反革命的間諜黨徒、此輩奸賊之最終目的、為“用一切手段及一切代價、清算吾國蘇維埃制度、毀滅蘇維埃政權、推翻工農政府、恢復地主及資本家在蘇聯之統治、彼等圖謀暗殺黨政領袖、盡其所能、惡意破壞國民經濟及國防、陰謀削弱紅軍威力、使其在將來戰爭中失敗、彼等出賣吾國軍事秘密與敵人、破壞紅軍的光榮武力、一般地並盡其所能、促進敵人對蘇聯之進攻、彼等準備應用其直接賣國手段、破壞前綫技術及物質給養以及作戰指揮動作、在戰事發生時造成紅軍在前綫之潰敗、及蘇維埃政府之顛覆、彼等期待其雇主某國軍界及法西斯界之援助、作為援助之代價、彼等準備割讓蘇屬烏克蘭普瓜分吾國領土、</p>
<p>“此輩賣國賊深知彼等不能得工農及工農紅軍之擁護、不敢顯呈其眞面目、乃在人民及紅軍士兵散佈欺騙手段、然此輩與資產階級、法西斯蒂國家軍部直接勾結的間諜組織者及首領今已破獲、並經蘇維埃司法機關按律治罪、作為蘇維埃政權的忠實可靠保壘的工農紅軍、今已毅然决然割除其健全的體格上之瘡癤、迅速加以清理、紅軍過去與將來永為不可抗的武力、紅軍無論何時永為建設社會主義新生活的勝利的人民之血與肉、整個紅軍從士兵至最高長官過去、現在及將來、永為固結一體的偉大戰鬥集團、在吾超羣絕倫的紅軍中、永無出賣祖國的奸徒之地位、吾人必須增進布爾雪維克的警覺性十倍、在一切方面提高並根本政進吾人工作、吾人必須提高自我批判、從而迅速並完全清算人崁公敵的確壞活動之結果、”（十三日塔斯電）</p>

<h3>日本政局年內可保小康</h3>
<p>政府力避與政黨磨擦　統制物價仍無其體策</p>
<p>［東京］中央社特派員返抵東京後、觀察日本政局、大致可於今年內保持小康、林內閣崩潰之原因、雖極端錯綜複雜、但最主要原因、似為不能緩和政府及政黨間之磨擦、及因物價騰貴所引起之社會不安情形所致、而林內閣手腕之過度拙劣、致增加種種不必要之磨擦、亦為總辭職之原因、結城豐太郎之財政、最初頗獲各方面之贊許、第因其實質與馬塲錢一之財政無甚差異、月深染一方面色彩、贊成資本家軍事工業、故終於引起各方面之反對、另一方面提倡滿洲五年計劃之失敗、使軍部對結城之信仰逐减少、加之佐藤尚武之對華外交姿態、使某方感覺佐藤對於日本之對華傳統精神缺乏認識、故有迫其辭退之必要、上述兩點為林內閣總辭之次要原因、近衛內閣之創立、厥為掃除林內閣所餘留之惡現象、故近衛內閣之使命、其主要者乃在消滅國內種種不必要之磨擦及統制物價、關於第一點、目前政友民政兩黨表示對新閣予以好意的支援、同時新閣僚自近衛起、表示無組織新黨之意、是則旣成政黨當不致對新閣採取反對態度矣、旣成政黨在議會中雖握有絕對多數之勢力、惟彼等之團結及環境、亦不能容其實現恢復政黨政府之企圖、因此彼等不得不暫時保持所謂“是是非非主義”、以應付現局、職是之故、七月間特別議會舉行時、政府與政黨間似不致發生對立情勢也、關於第二點、物價騰貴已成不可避免之趨勢、大量入超之數額有實行統制進口貿易之必要、而統制進口貿易及施行高稅、更刺激物價之上漲、國際貿易之差額自必引起一種問題、卽如何保持國際收支之平衡、物價之飛漲不已及過重之稅收負担、必致要求增加工資之勞工糾紛、及一般國民生活不安定之煩慮均隨之增加、新閣目前仍未尋覓統制物伏之具體方策、至少在十年以內、日本軍事預算祇有增加而無减少之希望、據目前約略估計、下屆財政年度之預算、至少將突破三十二萬萬或三十三萬萬圓之數、故如何編製此種龐大預算、而不致再度增加稅率、實為近衛內閣所遭遇最嚴重問題之一也、關於對華外交、新閣雖欲完成前閣所未竟之調整兩國關係之任務、惟日本國內所存在之不一致的因素旣未掃除、則仍不致接受我國清除政治障碍之一致願望、故如日本國內局勢未見變更、恐中日關係無好轉之希望、但亦未必更見惡化此間現對近衛內閣之輿論、表示所抱期待較近衛組閣時减少、此則或由於日本政治及經濟內層之相互矛盾之因素過多所致、故任何人出而負此鉅艱、處置此種緊張局勢、均難策劃能滿足民衆願望及適合潮流趨勢之政策、近衛內閣難關重重、且看靑年宰相有何妙計也、（十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>編者按：所得稅申報表類編製法，自刋載以來、頗承讀者歡迎。乃為篇輻所限，有時雖竭力刪减他稿，仍難刋布。因之常為讀者所不滿，時來垂詢，頻加督促，皆以早日刋畢相要求。溯自發刋迄今，已歷四月，確有未便再延之勢。然欲就商業新聞中分期刋載，正不知何日能肅淸。不得已借本期經濟專刋地位，將宿稿一律登全。另有一所得稅各類征收須知之修正要旨”，仍不得不俟明日續載。惟經濟專刋積稿亦甚多，今日又為所得稅占去一期地位，此編者對於專刋惠稿諸君深表歉忱也。</p>
<p>㊉㊂第一類一時營利事業所得不能按資本計算者所得稅自繳用報告表</p>
<p>營利事業所得稅，分甲•乙•丙•三項，其內項卽一時營利事業之所得稅也。此種一時營利事業，有設定相當之資本者，有並無資本者。其設有資本者，就其純全開益資本實額之百分率課稅。申報時適用甲•乙兩項營利事業所得稅目繳用報告表，無資本者，則採用本表以為申報。</p>
<p>依施行細則第十二條之規定，買賣與本業務無關之物品證劵或金銀貨幣，其所得為一時營利。非營業之個人，為前項之買賣，而不於約定期日以現貨交割者亦同。此條規定，不論資本之有無均包括之。至於一時營業所得稅，其應自繳或扣繳，則施行細則第二十七條，有明文規定。其規定曰，“屬於第一類丙項者，如有支付所得之機關，由該機關業務負責人代為扣繳。如無支付機關，由納稅義務人或其代理人自行繳納。”依此規定，一時營利所得之如交易所市場中買賣等者，應由支付所得機關之經紀人，代為扣繳，其無支付機開如普通市場中之買賣，始可由納稅義務人（或其代理人）自行繳納。但施行細則第十二條中，曾明定其所得不在本業務收入項下計算者，始以一時營利事業論。則凡遇一時營利之所得，祇須併入本業收入項下，卽無須獨立為所得稅之申報。其所得之來源，縱有交易所經紀人等支付機關，亦可拒絕經紀人之代扣所得稅。不過施行細則第十二條中之所謂“本業務”者，應指甲•乙•兩項營利事業而言。且應指甲•乙•兩項營利事業之本須將其全部營利事業所得，計算稅額，向當地主管徵收機關繳納所得稅而言。若納稅義務人無此資格，卽應由其支付機關，代扣所得稅。此種代扣之申報，另有買賣證劵。物品•金銀•貨幣所得稅扣繳用報告表，不在本表範圍以內。</p>
<p>營利事業之有本分支店，而其本店在中華民國國外，分支店營業所在國內。或分支店營業所在國外，本店在國內者。依施行細則第五條之規定，無論其資本是否劃分，凡國內營業上所生之利益，均須作為一時營利事業所得課稅，且均須照暫行條例第四條稅率課稅。暫行條例第四條之稅率，蓋不能按資本額計算者之稅率也，當然適用本表之格式。惟依本類征收須知第一條之規定，上述之分支店營業所在國外，而本店在國內云者。係指分支店營業所全部在國外者而言。如分支店一部份在國外者，其在國內部份之營利所得，仍可按資本額計算。祇須將其在國外部份營業上之盈利，劃在本店純益以外耳。考國內之營利事業，有一部份之分支店作國外者，往往有之。如完全照施行細則第五條之規定課稅，稅額將不勝其重。征收須知加以補充。使其仍可照甲•乙兩項營利事業，計算所　税、自屬甚宜。至於國外部份盈利之應劃在本店純益以外，亦是屬地稅原則上之所當然。惟如此劃分，則其在國外部份之分支店，不可不劃分或估定甚資本，以在國內本店資本中減除之耳。”茲說明本表之編製法如次：</p>
<p>㊀營業種類納稅人名稱地址、納稅人者，納稅義務人也，亦卽本表之申報人也，在本表中應記明名稱，地十！及營業種類。本表之用途，往往為普通市場上之一時營利，如非營業之個人，在交易所市場以外為物品•證劵•或金銀貨幣之買賣等是。此種營利，亦有數人合夥為之者。但合夥營業之設定資本者，須用甲•乙兩項營利事業所得稅自繳用報告表以為申報，與本表無關。</p>
<p>㊁結算日期•報告日期結算日期者，一時營利事業所得之算出日期也。報告日期、則為本表之申報日期。在本表中均應記明之。依暫行條例第九條之規定，第一類丙項項得稅，無論扣繳或自繳，均應於結算後一個月內為所得額之申報，又依施行細則第二十六條之規定，此種所得稅，應於結算申報日起二十日內繳納之。條文所用結算字樣，係指帳簿上算出其所得額而言。至於此項所得，是否已經實際收到，非稅法之所問。</p>
<p>㊂收益總額•營業開支收益總額者，營業上實收及可收之總收益也。營業開支者，係指營業上已付及應付未付之必要合理費用，乃呆帳•拆舊•盤存消耗以外之其他捐費也。此種收支，為算出所得純益額之基礎，在本表中應記明之。收益應包括本次營利上利益之全部。開支則依施行細則第十五條及本類征收須知第十四條之規定，自有相當之限制。依法•意而言，其收益與開支，應附具明細表。資產與負債，亦應列表申報。觀於施行細則第二十四條之規定，大意甚明，但本表之格式，未有此種規定。</p>
<p>㊃純益額•應納稅額，收益總額减去營業開支，卽為純益額，此卽所得額也。根據此純益額，乘此暫行條例第四條所規定之稅率，卽得應納所得稅額，在本表中均應記明之。暫行條列第七條之規定曰，第一類之所得額，以純益討算課稅，本表所記之純益額，卽屬此種性質。依暫行條例第四條之規定，第一類丙項所得之不能按資本額計算者，其稅率為全額累進稅。計自所得一百元以上一千元未滿，課稅千分之三十起，累進至所得一萬八千元以上一律課千分之二百止。較之甲•乙兩項所得稅之以千分之一百爲最高者，其稅率蓋較重，惟所得未滿一百元者，則不課稅耳。</p>
<p>以上為本表之編製方法。本表編製完竣後，卽由納稅人卽本表之申報人簽名蓋章，申報於當地之主管征收機關。</p>
<p>㊉㊃第一類甲乙兩項營利事業因合併解散歇業轉盤之所得自繳用報告表</p>
<p>施行細則第二十二條之規定曰，“第一類甲•乙兩項之營利事業，因合併•解散•歇業•淸理•經結算後仍有所得者，應…申報其所得額。受破產之宣告，經淸理後仍有所得者，破產管財人…申報其所得額。”本類征收須知第十八條，則曰“…因合併•解散•歇業•轉盤•經淸算或淸理後……”，本表蓋卽申報此項淸算或淸理所得額所用之報告表也。考第一類甲•乙兩項營利事業之結算其所得額，均以純益額為根據。純益額當然與資產總額超過資本與負債總額之餘數相同。但各種資產負債之結算。有進行的與淸算的之別。進行的結算，係以使用價值為基礎。淸算的結算。係以賣却價值為基礎。同一資產，其依賣却價值為估價者，當然與依使用價值為估價者不同。同一負債，其依存續性質計算者。與依了結性質計算者。其估價亦可發生差別。甲乙丙項平時之結算。係為進行的結算，而合併，解散，歇業，轉盤等時之結算，則為賣却的結算。後者所結出之純益額。當然可與前者發生差別。故本表所報告之所得額，其性質與甲乙兩項營利事業所得稅自繳用報告表中所計算者不同。設有某商號。在本年底已依平時結算之方法。報告其所得。如同時須將其商號依合拼，解散，歇業，轉盤之方式。辦理結束。即應將資產負債另行佔計，結出其財產乘餘額，以與原有財產額相比較。而就其超過額。再扣所得稅。此種所各稅之用意。似有取締平時結算之有隱匿其利益之行為者。凡平時結算之故抑其資產之估價或藏匿其收益者，在合併，解散，歇業，轉盤等時，旣須依賣却價值結算。則其眞相必須暴露。根據其眞相以計算其超過原有結算額，而課以所得稅，亦事理之所當然也。惟依此意義，必須就其利益之未經徵課所得稅者徵課之，始為允當。所謂未經課稅之利益者，可列舉如左：</p>
<p>㊀資產之升價　資產在平時結算上，應施行折舊，呆帳並開除無形資產，其帳面之記載額。往往减至實額之下。此種减低，祇須不與本類徵收須知所附之資產估價方法相牴觸，卽為合法。因合法之减價所隱匿之利益，主管徵收機關在平時當然無從課稅。但至淸算或淸理時，資產應重新估價，資產估價方法第一項，所𢇶合併，解散，歇業，轉盤，淸理時，槪以時價為估價之標準者，意卽指此。則資產實額之小於帳面者，有須升價。呆帳準備，折舊準備之多提者，心房肥入盈餘。牌號商標權等之可以較高於帳面之價賣出者，亦須作為利益。至於帳面所無之資產，能作價賣却者，更應列入利益。</p>
<p>㊁負債之减除　負債在平時結算上，係照賬面為全額之估價。若在淸算或淸理時，可以减除其一部份者，應轉入利益。例如發行債票時之可以減價收回，或進貨帳欵之可以折讓等是。</p>
<p>㊂利益之應收　損益之計算、如平時係採實收制，則應收利益之未經入帳者，在淸算或淸理時，必須加以估計。</p>
<p>㊃捐費之收回　損益之計算，如平時係採實付制，則已付捐費之可以收回者。在淸逄或淸理時，應轉入利益。其係採應付制者，遇有可以轉銷部份，卽應轉銷之。</p>
<p>㊄法定公積金　依施行細則第十五條之規定，股份有限公司及股份兩合公司之計算所得稅。可在純益額提去法定公積金之後，此項法定公積金，蓋為所得保留部份之未經課稅者。</p>
<p>右述五種，卽屬於未經課稅之利益。在平時自無須算出其應納之稅額。在淸算或淸理時，則應加以計算也。惟於此有應注意者，資產之估價。有高於賬面者，亦有低於帳面者。負債有可以减除者，亦有可以新發生者。他若利益損失項目，利益之應收者有之，應返還者亦有之。捐費之應收回者有之，應補付者又有之。其全部帳目之為盈為虧。要須彙總軋算，以覘其淸算或淸理之財產價值，較平時結算時為高為低。如較高則就其財產剩餘額超過原有財產額之部份謀課。而向來所提之法定公積金，應另行提出課稅。如較低，则其積存之法定公積金，應先以之彌被虧損，然後以餘額，負擔所得稅也。</p>
<p>合併，解散，歇業，轉盤，而經淸算或淸理者，何以須依時價結算，此事似應再加以說明。考營業之解散，歇業，轉盤而經淸算或淸理者，其原有之業務，作為終止，所有財產。應即分派，其須依時價結算。為業務終止後當然之事情。至於合併，依通俗觀念言，其原有之業務，雖似存在於合併後之業務之中。而依法律上之見地言，則合併後所組織之業務為新發生的。其被合併者，應歸消滅。業務旣歸消滅，自亦應依時價結算，時價蓋即了結價值也</p>
<p>自所得稅開徵。合夥事業。紛紛改組為公司。改組在法律上為舊組織之消滅，與新組織之發生。其舊組織消滅時之盤價，如高於二十五年十二月三十一日止之結價，亦應申報本表，繳納所得稅。至於將來合併，解散，歇業，轉盤所得之課稅，其法定公積金部份，似應以二十六年一月一日以後所發生者為限。</p>
<p>茲說明本表之編製方法於左：</p>
<p>㊀納稅人名稱地址，營業種類　納稅即為人納稅義務人，應在本表中記明其名稱地址，及其營業種類。在本表之格式內，於納稅人名稱一項，以括弧註明“或淸算人•淸理人”字樣，則辦理合併•解散•歇業•轉盤等事務之推定淸算人或淸理人者用之。查公司法及破產法等之規定，均有淸算人名稱。至於淸理人，則祇已經廢棄之商人債務償還暫行條例中有此規定。以現行法律之法理而言，似以稱淸算人為宜。凡公司•商號•行棧•工廠等之業務負債人，均可任為淸算人。而業務負責人以外之人，亦司以股東之推選或法院之選派，担任淸算人。以業務負責人以外之人担任淸算人時，本表中記之營業種類，應為被淸算營利事業之營業種類。</p>
<p>㊁結算日期，報告日期，結算日期卽為本表所報所得之結算日期，報告日期，則為本表之申報日期。在表中均應記明之。依施行細則第二十二條之規定，本表所申報之所得，應於結算日起二十日內，向當地主管徵收機關為申報。依同細則第二十六條之規定，應於申報日起二十日內為稅欵之繳納。考本表所報告之所得稅，係了結的所得稅，須俟全部帳目了結後，然後編製本表。</p>
<p>㊂原有資本額，財產剩餘額，本類征收須知第十八條，對於淸算或淸理後之剩餘財產額，本規定“除已課所得稅者外，超過原有資本實額者，就其超過部份課稅。”此項資本實額與財產剩餘額，均於本表中記明之。依本表之格式，為原有資本額而非資本實額。為符合法令起見，當然以改為資本實額為宜，惟淸算或淸理所得，總須以淸算或淸理後之財產，超過淸算或淸理前平時結算所結出之財產部份，而另加本課稅之公債金，為其所得額。所謂資本實額者，依施行細則第七條及本類徵收須知第六條之規定，為已繳資本，加各種公積金及盈餘滾存之三分之一，較之之規定，為已繳資本，加各種公積金及盈餘滾存之三分之一，較之平時結算所結出之財產，性質似有不同。徵收須知第十八條之規定，應否加以修改，似尚值得考慮也。</p>
<p>不過就另一方面言之、所謂“剩餘之財產，除已課所得稅者外，超過原有資本實額者……”，其剩餘財產，應除去已課所得稅之任意公積及盈餘滾存等，然後與原有資本實額相比較。則其淸算或淸理後之剩餘財產，係除去任意公積與盈餘滾存等後之純資產。如表中之原有資本額地位，祇記實在繳足或實際投入之本金，而不併計公積金等在內。其前者超過後者之部份，仍與將淸算或淸理後之全部財產，超過淸算或淸理前平時結算所結出之全部財產之額，而另加未課稅之法定金積金者相同。徵收須知等十八條之規定，祇須將其所謂“原有資本實額者”，另加解釋卽可。則本表格式中所定之原有資本額，似反較須知中所定之原有資本實額為宜矣。</p>
<p>㊃財產剩餘額超過原有資本額部份應納稅額　根據財產剩餘額超過原有資本額部份，再除去已課所得稅者外，卽為淸算或淸理後之所得。依本類徵收須知第十八條之規定，應照暫行條例第四條之稅率課稅。此種稅率，蓋一時營利事業所得不能按資本額計算者之稅率也。自最低課千分之三十，累進至千分之二百為止。所得不滿一百元不課稅。</p>
<p>所謂“除去已課所得稅者”，任意公積及盈餘滾存，當然包括在內。其平時於分派盈餘時所提之各項實準備，（卽不以填補資產不足額為目的之準備）亦應屬之。</p>
<p>以上計述，為本表之編製方法。本表編製完竣後，卽應記明日期，由報告負責人簽名蓋章，連同淸算書政淸理計算書。呈報於當地主管徵收機關。報告負責人，在淸算時為淸算人，在淸理時為淸理人，在破產時，則為破產管理人。</p>
<p>淸算計算書或淸理計算書，為報告淸算或淸理所得時必須另具之明細表。在本類徵收須知第二十三條中，蓋有明文規定。此種明細表之附具，按之法意，當然在詳細表示其財產之處置，及所得之來源。則資產變賣與債務償還之較淸算或淸理前之平時結算為盈為虧，以及損益帳目之整理，法定公積金之有無餘剩等，均應於此種計算書中表示之。而本類征收須知第十八條所規定之計算方法，卽剩餘財產額除已課所得稅者外，超過原有資本額之部份，亦應於此種計算書中算出之。</p>
<p>㊉㊄買賣證劵•物品•金銀•貨幣所得扣繳用報告表</p>
<p>買賣證劵，物品，金銀，貨幣之所得，不屬於本業之範圍，且不計入本業收入項下。或非營業之個人，為此種買賣而有所得者，謂之一時營利所得。依施行細則第十二條及第二十七條之規定，其有支付機關者，應由該機關之業務負責人，代為扣繳所得稅。本表卽用以申報此種所得稅者也。凡委託經紀人，在交易所市塲上為交易，而本身無本類甲乙兩項營利事業之納稅資格者，最適用本表之格式。本表爲報告表，另有附屬淸單，以詳列各納稅義務人之所得情形。報告表內所紀之金額。均以淸單爲根據。故在編製報告表時，應先編製淸單，茲卽先說明淸單之編製法。</p>
<p>報告表所申報之所得稅，為扣繳的，依施行細則第二十八條之規定，扣繳所得稅者，應開具各個納稅義務人之所得額。淸單之用途，卽為適合此條規定者。淸單中所紀之要項如次。</p>
<p>㊀扣繳人　扣繳人卽為扣繳所得稅之人，在交易所為經紀人，應記明其戶為於淸單。經絕人對於委託客戶託做之交易結算時，應根據其結算之所得，計算所得稅，代為扣下，彙總報繳。但客戶之合於施行細則第十二條計入本業務收入項下之規定者，其一時營利之所得，旣可併入本業務收入項下，以待每年度終了時，總筆記算本類甲乙兩項之營利事業所得及其應納之所得稅。在各個一時營利有所得時，旣無須為損益少獨立結算，自無庸經紀人代為扣繳所得稅。至於經紀人之本身，原為本類甲乙兩項之營利事業，其所得並非一時或利所得，應依本類甲表即甲乙兩項營利事業所得額自繳用報告表之格式及編製法，申報其所得額及應額稅額，不屬於本報告表及淸單之範圍。</p>
<p>㊁年月日　淸單中應記明年月日，依暫行條例第九條之規定，一時營利之扣繳所得稅，應於結算後一個月內申報之。而在報告表中，祇有結算年月日，並無申報年月日，淸單中關於各個納稅人這所得，又別無結算年月日之地位。故淸單下端所註之注意事項中，亦說明此項淸單，須每日填報一次，交易所中之一時營利，因每日有了結之交易也。</p>
<p>㊂納稅人　納稅人即為納稅義務人，亦即負擔所得稅之所得人，應記明其戶名於淸單，蓋即經紀人之委託各戶也。依暫行條例第二條免稅之規定，第一類所得中，不以營利為目的之法人所得，免納所得稅。但依施行細則第十三條之規定，非營利事業之法人或團體，而兼營營利事業者，視為營利事業。則凡委䚽經紀人為證劵，物品，金銀，貨幣等之買賣，而有所得者，無論其是否為不以營利為目的之法人，均為納稅義務人”。</p>
<p>㊃營業種類所得種類　營業種類，係指證劵，物品，金銀，貨幣等而言。所得數額，則為該項營業所得之利益。在淸單中，應分別納稅人，逐一註明之。所得數額，為各個一時營利所獲盈餘之數額。依施行細則第十九條之規定，應於各個交易結算時，計算其所得額。淸單中所記之所得數額，應就各個交易，分別列記之。</p>
<p>㊄傭金純益額扣繳所得稅額　依暫行條例第七條之規定，第一類營利事業之所得，均以純益額計算課稅。經記人佣金，為此項營利上之必要開支，所得數額减去佣金，始為純益額。根據此純益額乘以暫行條例第四條所規定之稅率，即為應扣繳之所得稅額。凡佣金，純益額，扣繳所得稅額，均應於淸單中註明之。凡純益不滿一百元者，依法無須納稅。超過一百元者，稅率自千分之三十，累進至千分之二百。</p>
<p>以上所述，為淸單之編製方法。淸單中之所得數額，佣金額，純益額，及扣繳所得稅額，應各結一總數，記入報告表。報告表之所記，蓋以淸單為根據。報告表除根據淸單。記入此種金額外，須記明扣繳者名稱，地址，營業種類及結算日期等。並將稅欵之繳納年月日，經收機關名稱及收據號次等，逐一記明，由負責人簽名，蓋章，報告於當地之主管徵收機關。依施行細則第二十六條之規定，此項所得稅，須於結算申報時繳納之，</p>
<p>買賣証劵，物品，金銀，貨幣，所得額扣繳用報告表，及其附屬之扣繳淸單，如前所述之編製法，均係根據現行法令及部頒格式而言，但在上海方面，月前經各交易所經紀人公會與當地主管徵收機關負責人之交涉，已新决定三要點：㊀委託客戶對於此種營利之所得，併入本業收入項下計算，依法無須由經紀人代扣繳所得稅者，經紀人仍負責申報其所得額，以資對照。㊁合於前項資格之客戶，以資本在二千元以上，而有申報營利事業所得稅者為限。㊂施行細則中所謂“各個交易結算時計算其所得額”云者，係指各筆交易了結時之盈虧而言。但有灑將多筆交易統軋盈虧，以計算所得稅者，亦可通融。此種統軋計算，至遲須每三個月結算一次。</p>
<p>依附於交易所經紀人之處，自立牌號，接受客戶之委託，再以自身之牌號為戶名，委託經紀人在交易所市塲上做交易者，其牌號通俗謂之小公司。小公司之性質，蓋不啻一不領經紀人執照之經紀人，在交易所上，本無其地位。但揆之事實，亦有其相當之存在機能。對於委託客戶之一時營利所得，究應如何申報及扣繳，尚為待决之問題。就交易所法言，所𢇶小公司者，僅可視為介紹人。原委託之客戶，應一併在經紀人帳上出帳，而由經紀人申報其所得額，或扣繳其所得稅。就已成習慣之事實言，似可由小公司自行申報或扣繳其客戶之所得額與所得稅。而小公司之本身，亦為第一類甲乙兩項營利事業之所得稅納稅義務人，深望當地主管微收機關，表示其所取之態度。（全交已完）</p>
<h3>所得稅各類微收須知之修碩要旨</h3>
<p>— 王逢年</p>
<p>我國所得稅創辦伊始，立法容有未週，各專家各商曾•羣貢意見，財政部廣咨博採，將各類徵收須知，資產估價方法及折舊表說明，酌予修正，於四月十二日公佈，茲將其條正要旨，分別闡明如下：</p>
<p>（甲）營利事業之所得</p>
<p>㊀免稅法人　修正案對於“不以營利為目的之法人”加以限制，“以合於民法總則公益社團及財團之組織，經向主管官署登記成立者為限”。</p>
<p>㊁公積金　原案第五項規定“以依法令規定之公積金為限”又第十一項（卽修正案第十三項）規定以公司法第一百七十條所稱之公積金為限，則合夥組織不能援用施行細則第七條之規定，以其三分之一併入資本以為輕稅之計算也，甚為明顯。我國商業組織，多數為合夥，而公司佔極少數，祇准少數公司援用而偏枯多數之合夥組織，殊難謂平。不佞與童𣻆瑗會講師具呈財政部請求修改，茲奉本月十二日財部公佈修正案知蒙採納，改為“凡法定公積，任意公積，盈餘滾存均屬之”，則合夥組織之有盈餘滾存或任意公積金者均得以其總額分之一，併入資本計算矣。但計算所得額時，按施行細則第十五條，及本修正案第十三項規定，仍不得先行扣除也。</p>
<p>㊂會計制度　通常記賬多用實收會制，而原案第九第十項之規定，則採應收應付制，故依施行細則第二十四條及原案第十七項之規定，申報所得額時，對於應行附呈之各種證明賬據，均須加以調整，商家苦之，不佞與童會計師以為有呈請變通之必要，茲讀修正案新增第十二欵文曰“除前二項規定外，營利事業亦得各依其營業之必要，或原有習慣以實收及已付者為範圍，計算其純益額。但一經採用。非於該年度開始前三個月呈請主管機關核准後，不得任意變更。”則兩種制度皆可任意採用矣。</p>
<p>㊃捐欵　援綏賑災購機各捐欵，似應作為開支，但為原案第十二項第三欵所不許，修正案將“捐字刪去，如認為必要合理捐欵，自得作為實際開支”之一種。</p>
<p>㊄營業上擴充或改革設備之費用　原案法意以為屬於“資本支出”，應作資產科目之“生財記賬”故不許作為捐費，但某種設備，其價值之存續期間，不能維持一年以上或於營業年度終了結賬時，其設備價值已經消滅者，則以作偽損耗開支”，較為合理，故修正案增添、足以增加其原有價值者”字樣，以為“不許”之限制，反言之倘其“不足增加原有價值者”卽得作為捐費開支矣。</p>
<p>㊅淸算或淸理後之剩餘財產超過原有資本額時原案第十六項規定全部課稅，第查此項超過額或為從前盈餘或為折舊後之溢價，或為呆賬之收回，後一項固應課稅，惟從前盈餘已於營業期間課稅，今復在淸算或淸理後，再予謀稅，未免重疊，不佞與童會計師僉以為有分別規定或剔除之必要，今修正案規定“除已課所得稅者外一以其餘超過額課稅，因知剔除之主張”已蒙採行矣•（未完）</p>

<h3>“法律”與“人情”</h3>
<p>— 靜觀</p>
<p>沈鈞儒等七君子的“危害民國案”，前天（十一日）在江蘇高等法院開審了。法官尚未宣判，後事如何，此刻還不知道。看看一般的民意和輿論，是大都希望他們能夠無罪釋放的。</p>
<p>我想起一句古話，呌做“王道不外乎人情”。</p>
<p>這眞是千古不磨的金方！王道也好，霸道也好，完冕堂皇的經典也好，莊嚴燦爛的法律也好，它們也許可以以雷霆之威，統治天下；然而旁邊總有一條眞理，冷然留在每個人的心中，來評定一切是非，這就是“人情”。—愚民是率直的，他們的腦子裏裝不下那麽多的條文，大的道理，凡事祇要入情入理，命乎大多數人的需要，就是它存在的基礎。要不然，他們會報你以無言的輕衊。</p>
<p>據說世界在日臻於文朋之城，而唯一的證據，就是我們已經有了許多法律，嚴緊得有如羅網，密佈人間，要消滅一切的野蠻與罪惡。可是相反地犯罪的人，却因此越來越多了。世豈有嗜罪成癖者？原因祇在乎一點：社會不合理，而法律不能適應環境時代，以彌補社會的缺陷，因此變得不近人情。</p>
<p>國國遭忌，且必欲入之於罪，就是最好的一例。</p>
<p>不久以前，報上登載過一則新聞，一個業已字人的少女，和一市井少年戀愛，受孕了；少年的母親慫恿着她，請一個穩婆去隨胎，事情泄露，被法院提起了公訴。墮胎有干禁例，因此審判的結果，那少女，穩婆，少年的母親都有罪；而少年則獨得無咎。—我們想想，世上還有這樣不近人情的事嗎？然而據法律，是應當這樣判斷的。</p>
<p>所以在法庭裏，從來祇有法官發問，而不許犯人反問。</p>
<p>陳胎不入道，是的。但不墮怎麽樣？我們這社會容許少女養私生子嗎？</p>
<p>倘使這麽一反問，法律就要碰在人情的石壁上，理由雖則仍然極其堂皇，可是“霸道”得很了。</p>
<p>然血一定要斷定法律不顧到人情，是不對的。不過那又有另一種說法，呌做“情有可原，法無可恕。”</p>
<h3>寃獄賠償運動</h3>
<p>— 李因非</p>
<p>寃獄賠償運動到現在已經是第三屆了。這三年來，成績是有的：“二十五年五月五日宣布之憲法草案，有國家賠償制度之專條：全國司法會議，並先經决議由司法院送立法院；今年舉行此種運動，更得初步草案脫稿之訊。”看樣子，樓梯已經在響了，人何時下來則還不知道，而人下來之後，是否執行，執行到如何程度，更在未可知之數中。</p>
<p>關於法律，我的知識實在太不夠；然而却不能說無緣。處此盛世中，“閉門家中坐，禍從天上來”的事情是常有的，各地環境不同，有一本紅書面的“吶喊”就以“反動”論罪者，就有過先例；這在平常禁不住還想看一點書，充一下可憐的腹儉者，就不免有惴惴然如履薄冰之惑。</p>
<p>現在是“寃獄賠償”的初步草案據聞業已脫稿了，何時公布，何時實施雖還不知道，而實施之後，“因為寃獄賠償制度的確立，不但曾遭沉寃而獲得平反的人，在精神上和物質上，得着無限的慰藉，使他心頭上被刺的創傷平復過來；從積極方面說，對於職掌刑罰權的官吏，在審理案件的時候，能夠平心靜氣地探求事實的眞相，不致曲解法絛，敷衍程序，甚至煆煉周納，造成莫須有的寃獄。”大概總能或多或少的做到。雖然，“刑期無刑，”有了寃獄的產生，這個國家社會已經不大高妙；而能否每件寃獄都能“平反，”現在也不敢保證。然而亡羊補牢，”“司直之士，凜於責任之重大，鞫獄斷訟，必將更臻詳愼，間接間收一點預防之效，那好處總大概可以有的。</p>
<p>所以，對於律師公會的這次“登高一呼，”我極願盡所能盡的綿方來資助，而也因之，我覺得律師公會的定每年六月間才來鼓吹，宣傳一次者，時日未免太短，也未免有一曝十寒之嫌。</p>
<p>而於寃獄賠償之外，尤不能無言者，則是業經制定的法律如何來保證實施。以“小矣哉”來作例，例如我們時常在馬路上可以看到的警察痛毆小販等等，試問法律是否有這樣的規定？而拘禁不得超過二十四小時，過時就得送法院審辦等等，恐怕也祇有知識份子而屬於“高等華人”者才能享受這“特權”吧？</p>
<p>自然，這問題是又過歸納到“寃獄賠償”上去，然而，有“寃獄賠償”的法令還未公布實施之前，這現象難道就允許它存在嗎？</p>
<p>而在文化落後的各鄕各村間，法律成為紳士們的家譜，則更是“例外”了。</p>
<h3>華德路監獄參觀記</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>幼童部分為兩類，一類是判定禁閉在改過所的，一類是判定禁閉在監獄的。這是因為第一特區法院往往把十五歲或十五歲以下的幼童判决監禁，把十八九歲的青年判决、改過所收禁，所以不得不分開禁閉，可是他們的待遇，是相同的。改過所的幼童，早晨上課堂讀書，下午學習工藝，其他的青年，晨間學習工藝，下午上課堂讀書，行為良好的，還能在空閒時作種種游戲。有些幼童，在改過所裏很用心學習，性情也純良，但一旦釋放出獄，便又受惡徒引誘，做扒兒手。曾有一個幼童說明他回到監獄的原因道：“在外面不偸東西，便要餓死。”這也是實情，所以助理獄長顏君C.Y.Yen　曾跟工商界接洽，替許多期滿出獄的幼童覓得職業、無奈公衆不很踴躍贊助這事，境在只有“救世軍援助出獄犯人部“與其他幾個慈善團體肯出力帮忙，可惜都因為經費不足，不能放開手做事。凡犯法住過牢監的人，無論他怎麽願意悔過自新，旁人對他，總覺得有些厭惡。所以替這些出獄的青年謀事，一開口就使人搖頭，這在各國，都是如此，上海自然也免不了的。</p>
<p>外國罪犯與外國婦女，都禁閉在另一所房屋，華德路監獄中却沒有一個中國女子。外國囚徒的餐品，與中國囚徒不同，他們所享的自由，也比中國囚徒為優。因為他們人數不多，（現在共約七十五名左右）所以讓他們聚在一處進餐。除掉不享領事裁判權的外國人外，其他各國的罪犯，都禁閉在這所監獄裏，其中俄國人與印度人佔數最多。判定長期徒刑的，却另閉在一處。這些外國囚徒，本國的駐滬領事每天都按照人數助費若干。獄中的女子，現不滿五名，另有女管獄員照料她們，她們都受很好的待遇，她們最苦的工作，不過自製被褥，打掃囚室，打掃囚室，是囚徒人人每天當為的工作。</p>
<p>因為華人部分的人數很多，所以做工的囚徒二千多名，都是三個人住一囚室、雖然覺得擠促些兒，但因此可以减去寂寞，囚徒都願意如此。工作是獄中的一種特殊享受，因為在工作的當兒，還可以偶然與同伴談幾句話，不致於獨個兒閉在一個小室中，像處在死墓裏一般，所以工作的囚徒，都不敢犯過，以免由工塲開除，過那死墓中的生活。</p>
<p>在這新獄造成以前，一九二九年四月，上海曾發生一次重大的越獄案。當時有一個判處死刑的囚徒，攻擊一個守衛的西捕，奪得手槍，擊死印捕兩名，又擊傷三名，後來他自己也被擊死了。從這次闖禍以後，獄中的守衛，都不准携帶武器，且不許有人受囚徒的委託，偶爾離開監獄，作送信等的勾當。我們試問獄吏數人，為什麼他們以為囚徒不敢嘗試越獄。他們的答語，却不相同，一人說，因為獄中的生活，比外面好，所以囚徒沒有逃走的念頭。又一人說，囚徒知道越獄斷難成功，所以他們當然不願愚而出此．這二人說的，都相當有理由的。</p>
<p>獄中的紀行，雖然很嚴，但是許多囚徒，尤某是一般靑年，住在獄裏，頗覺安頓。自然其中也有若干，很願意早日脫離牢籠。不過不是兒童所能幹的事。監獄的四周，有二十五呎的高墻圍着，墻上有十一座瞭望塔，晝夜有俄國聯隊的隊員守望。只要有一些兒不妥的現象，塔上守衛用指把機關輕輕一捺，四處的警鈴，便立刻大鳴。有四十六名武裝俄兵，由一個軍官率領，隨峙準備出動，應付越獄的事變。此外還有中西印捕與助同守獄的人們五百零八名，可做</p>
<h3>賽金花</h3>
<p>— 九陳禾</p>
<p>廿九</p>
<p>賽金花鑒於國家安危，在和義一繫，義不容辭地允許李鴻章去向克林德夫人說項。但公使夫人因為死了她丈夫，定要太后償命，清帝賠罪，理直氣壯，使賽金花也為難了。最後經賽金花申大義，闡兩國之福利，卒獲公使夫人允讓退步。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>帮手。為謹愼起見，獄中的囚徒，不使他們多數聚在一處，每天體操，都分次舉行，每次限定人數。囚徒都在自己的囚室進餐，工塲也都有相當的限度，每個工塲，都把塲門緊鎖，門外有武裝印捕一名把守。囚徒都在下午四時三十分閉入囚室，所以在天黑之前，便須點名，第二天早晨六時，須一律起身。囚室的門閂，都很笨重，每一排囚室，有一個人專任守衛。夜裏有巡差打更，守衛都須按時到各站報告，倘若發生意外事故，守衛不能及時報告，有警鈴自動報警。</p>
<p>這些設備，與保安的方法，無疑地使許多囚徒不敢存越獄的變心。但是假使華德路監獄有同樣狀况下收容同數的外國囚徒，却不敢保他們沒有越獄的勾當。每天獨個兒枯坐在一間小囚室裏，旣沒有同伴，又沒有消閒的事物，只有行為良好能識字的，偶爾得到些書籍，這種境况，除了東方人以外，都要煩悶而起紛擾的。囚徒除掉每天兩次體操，只有星期日外面來的中外教士對他們宣講的時候可以破除煩悶。他們偶爾也有不能忍耐，自縊身死的，但這是難得遇見的事情。獄中的醫院，飲食稍為好些，住的地方，也稍為舒服些，所以他們大都巴望害病，但病魔不來惠顧，却怎麽好呢？假裝有病，那却瞞不過醫生的。</p>
<p>囚徒每𨹜三個月，可以由家局或朋友前往訪問一次，談話十分鐘。但探望人須站在探望室粗鐵絲方格的後面，離開數呎談話，中間是看管人出入的一條狹走道。囚徒都不許收受贈品，所以他們是沒有安慰品的享受，因為只要冒出一縷兒烟便足哄動多人的。他們每天的維持生活費，每人四角五分，糧食佔一角二分。判定死刑的囚徒，另外禁閉在一排囚室裏，他們也跟其餘囚徒相同，都抱着達觀。他們所恨的，判定死刑之後，往往躭擱許多時不行刑，他們有走“最後一哩”路的當兒，比其他一切種族人們，都覺得豪爽勇敢。（完）（譯英文大美晚報）</p>

<h3>Minister of Finance Kong Elaborates on China's National Debt Policy</h3>
<p>Willing to Borrow Foreign Loans at Low Interest Rates to Consolidate Domestic Debt; Construction Projects Welcome Cooperation from Friendly Nations</p>
<p>[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, today received an interviewer from the "German General Report" and issued an important statement on China's foreign debt policy. Minister Kong first pointed out that all countries should undoubtedly recognize the great work accomplished by the Chinese government, the Kuomintang, and the people of the entire country. He can use this trip to reassure friendly nations about this fact and takes pride in it. He then stated that the Chinese people are now arranging everything within the country and welcome help and cooperation from all other countries to jointly seek the construction of a "New China" in friendly competition. Minister Kong then elaborated on China's foreign debt policy, pointing out that the current situation in the international capital market is extremely conducive to issuing loans, and China's economic development is suitable for foreign capital investment, with the government's customs revenue as the supreme guarantee. This year's customs revenue will be at least 450,000,000 silver dollars or more, while the foreign debt guarantee is only 100,000,000 silver dollars, and the domestic debt is no more than 200,000,000 silver dollars, so there is still 150,000,000 yuan available as a loan guarantee.</p>
<p>Secondly, Minister Kong solemnly stated that the purpose of China raising foreign debt is not for building railways or starting industries, but is limited to accepting long-term loans for the purchase of materials. If it is to stabilize China's currency, then China can do without foreign capital, but it is not easy to seek a reasonable investment that also keeps the domestic currency balanced. Minister Kong then mentioned the success of issuing domestic public bonds in recent years and stated that the Chinese government should continue to work along the previous path to establish a railway system and industries, and strive for complete self-development without using debt. Minister Kong then stated, "China is prepared to accept low-interest foreign loans to change its high-interest domestic debt. According to the current situation of the financial and capital market, there is obviously an opportunity to do so." China currently has about 20,000,000,000 yuan of domestic debt, with an interest rate of six percent per week. However, due to the low selling price, the interest can reach eight percent. If foreign debt can be borrowed at four percent per week, the government will save 80,000,000 yuan in interest each year, which can be used to revitalize industry. Minister Kong finally pointed out the unity of China, the establishment of transportation networks and industries, the increase in foreign trade, and the military success in suppressing the Communists, saying that the areas occupied by the Communist Party are extremely small. Finally, Minister Kong solemnly declared, "The Chinese government's foreign policy can be summed up in one sentence, that is, it is willing to cooperate peacefully with all nations in the world that hold the same policies and principles."

<h3>Special Envoys Kong and Chen Meet with Hitler</h3>
<p>⊙Munich, Germany. Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao, and the Chinese Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang and their party arrived here this morning. They had lunch at the "Royal Chamber" at the station, which is a rest room for foreign dignitaries. Afterwards, they took four cars sent by Head of State Hitler to the town of Berchtesgaden, touring the famous lakes of Bavaria along the way. They arrived in the town at 3:00 PM.

<p>⊙Berchtesgaden. Head of State Hitler recently received Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan, and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Weng Wenhao at his villa in the afternoon, introduced by Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang. Vice President Kong and others bowed to Head of State Hitler to pay their respects. Head of State Hitler responded with a National Socialist Party salute and delivered a welcome speech. He then invited the guests to sit at a large round table in the reception hall. The snow-capped Bavarian Alps were in sight, which was very beautiful. Vice President Kong and others praised it endlessly. Shortly afterwards, Head of State Hitler led his close staff to talk with Vice President Kong. He first inquired about the health of General Chiang Kai-shek and expressed his happiness that General Chiang had returned to work after his leave. He then praised Vice President Kong's contribution to stabilizing China's currency system and said that the German government is very concerned about the development of China's economy and technology and is very willing to support it. Vice President Kong was very satisfied to hear this and then took his leave. He then led the group back to Munich by car. The local garrison commander, General Lechner, Commander of the Seventh Army, held a reception to welcome them. (General Lechner had recently been ordered to visit China.)

<h3>China's Construction</h3>
<p>Progress in Both Spiritual and Material Aspects; French Newspaper Praises Chiang's Continued Contributions</p>
<p>[Paris] The newspaper "Le Temps" recently published a dispatch from Nanjing by the famous reporter De Boschke, detailing China's progress in recent years. He wrote, "In general, China's material progress is indeed thriving, and the progress of transportation and the development of the highway network are particularly obvious. Moreover, thanks to the development of transportation, the progress of major cities has gradually spread to inland towns and villages. Various other construction projects are also actively underway. In addition to material construction, there is also the 'New Life Movement' dedicated to spiritual construction. General Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Executive Yuan of China, is its chief initiator. We only need to read Mr. Chiang's published speeches and the new creeds put forward by the New Life Movement to know that its purpose is to establish a kind of socialism with Christian characteristics. This can be gradually implemented under Mr. Chiang's planning. It can be seen that China will rely heavily on Mr. Chiang's leadership in the future."

<h3>De Wang Convenes a Meeting of Bandit and Puppet Leaders in Jiabusi Temple</h3>
<p>Decided to Reduce the Scope of the Puppet Inner Mongolia Military Government; A Certain Party Sets Up a Disguised Espionage Agency in Northern Chahar</p>
<p>[Beiping] The puppet Inner Mongolia Military Government led by De Wang was previously criticized for its poor performance. The puppet government's original budget was 500,000 yuan per month, including 400,000 yuan for military expenses and 100,000 yuan for political expenses. Since June, 122,000 yuan has been deducted and used for Inner Mongolia espionage expenses. The puppet government's military and political expenses are now only 378,000 yuan. De Wang is very panicked and has been convening meetings with Wu Heling, Bao Yueqing, Li Shouxin, and other senior puppet officials in the puppet Inner Mongolia Military Headquarters in Jiabusi Temple for several days. It is reported that the result is that the scope of the puppet Inner Mongolia Military Government will be reduced, and it is planned to abolish unimportant departments and divisions. The puppet government is now on the verge of decline. (Special dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] A certain party recently established clubs in Shangdu, Baoyuan, Duolun, Kangbao, Zhangbei, and other counties in Northern Chahar.

The interior is equipped with mahjong, pai gow, poker, dice, gambling houses, opium, heroin, morphine, and other eight major sections. The staff is composed of Japanese and Korean ruffians. Each club must pay a tax of 40 yuan in Chinese currency per day. The Duolun club is large in scale and must pay a tax of 60 yuan. The Zhangbei club was established at the beginning of this month. It is estimated that each club can generate a profit of 120,000 yuan per year for the puppet government. This agency, nominally for entertainment, is actually an espionage agency.

<h3>Rice Inspection Regulations</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Rice Inspection and Supervision Office, newly established by the Ministry of Industry, is now actively underway.

<h3>Zou Minchu, a Guangdong Provincial Committee Member, Is Dismissed and Investigated for Manipulating Finance</h3>
<p>An Official Who Actually Engaged in Private Speculation; Escorted to Nanjing by the Security Office</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] In early May, rumors about the Guangdong provincial currency system were rife. The Guangdong silver market reopened at this time, and speculators seized the opportunity to manipulate finance, causing extreme confusion in the market reports for a time. According to the orders of the Ministry of Finance, the provincial authorities immediately stopped futures trading. After a thorough investigation by President Chiang, it was found to be related to Zou Minchu, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee. It turned out that Zou had established the Hengji Bank in Guangdong, managed by his brother Zou Qingfu. Zou was also the chairman of the Guohua Bank and bought and sold futures in the name of Hengji and Guohua. After receiving the report, President Chiang believed that Zou, as an official, openly engaged in private speculation, which was extremely illegal. If he was not punished, how could officialdom be cleaned up? He immediately dismissed Zou from his post and telegraphed Guangdong to escort Zou to Nanjing for investigation and handling. According to reliable sources, Zou was escorted north by the Guangdong Security Office on the 14th. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>Record of the National Handicraft Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Mingxin</p>
<p>The National Handicraft Exhibition, jointly organized by the National Economic Construction Movement General Assembly and the Ministry of Industry, officially opened on May 20th at the Capital Art Exhibition Hall. A total of 23 provinces and cities participated, including remote provinces such as Gansu, Erdos, Yunnan, Chahar, and Ningxia, all exhibiting products. The total number of exhibits reached 27,484. Due to the inability to collect items from the four northeastern provinces, a small number of items found by the exhibition were displayed separately. The exhibition was scheduled for one month and was supposed to close on June 20th. As of the 13th, the number of visitors had reached over 60,000. Due to the location, tickets were required at a price of one dime, yet the daily number of visitors remained overwhelmingly crowded. This was because the exhibits were comprehensively collected and many were rarely seen on ordinary days, a dazzling array of beautiful objects, demonstrating the painstaking efforts of those who collected them. Our reporter, at the invitation of Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, went to Beijing to visit, accompanied by Mr. Xu Xin-yi, representative of the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, and Mr. Wang Ji-lin, representative of various member newspapers, and eight others. They took the overnight train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at 11 PM on the 12th and arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 13th. After a light breakfast, they telephoned the Ministry of Industry. Minister Wu assigned Wu Cheng-fu, secretary of the ministry, and Gu Yu-xuan, director of the Central Industrial Testing Institute of the ministry, to greet them with a car and accompany them to the Art Exhibition Hall on Guofu Road for a visit. They also provided explanations one by one, for which we are deeply grateful. The following is a brief record of what I saw and heard.</p>
<p>The venue borrowed the Art Exhibition Hall and a portion of the second floor of the National Assembly Hall. The Art Exhibition Hall, consisting of three floors, served as the main exhibition hall, with exhibits displayed in ten categories. Part of the second floor of the National Assembly Hall served as a comprehensive exhibition hall and a special exhibition hall. The comprehensive exhibition combined local specialties for display. Among the special exhibitions, the tea exhibition room was beautifully arranged, with harmonious lighting and even color schemes, which was quite rare. The exhibits collected from various units included 1,422 items from Hebei Province, 113 items from Suiyuan Province, 23 items from Ningxia, 461 items from Qingdao City, 37 items from Weihaiwei, 993 items from Jiangxi Province, 1,284 items from Shandong Province, 172 items from Chahar, 6,252 items from Shanghai City, 226 items from Shanxi Province, 3,383 items from Jiangsu Province, 887 items from Yunnan Province, 1,201 items from Nanjing City, 853 items from Anhui Province, 118 items from Henan Province, 1,169 items from Zhejiang Province, 322 items from Hunan Province, 1,677 items from Peiping City, 779 items from Fujian Province, 1,110 items from Tianjin City, 430 items from Sichuan Province, 4,400 items from Guangdong Province, and 700 items from Gansu Province.</p>
<p>The exhibits in the exhibition were primarily clothing, including all items for apparel. Due to the large number of items, only the essential ones are listed here, such as local cloth, printed cloth, lace, embroidery, thread brocade, and handmade clothing, hats, shoes, and leather goods, all comprehensively displayed. Among them, there were a Mieleng Buddha crown, a Ban brush Buddha attire, and a green flower hat, each extremely exquisite and eye-catching. The most valuable of the metallurgical products were Yunnan Wugang black steel, bronze, and spotted copperware, along with Fujian filigree silver ware, supplied for exhibition by Yunnan Gonghexiang, Baoyunxiang, Yunxinglong, and Fujian Yezhenfeng. It is understood that this spotted copper can be used directly for manufacturing after being mined, as its copper is pure and does not require further refining. There were also old-style hairpin bracelet copper molds and remaining pieces, which were also rare items. The second floor housed pottery, with participants from Anhui, Sichuan, Jiangsu, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, and other provinces. Various ancient and contemporary utensils and figures included magnetic split porcelain, famille rose, fine details, mille-fleur gold ground, as well as Yixing pottery, Peiping glazed tiles, glass utensils, historical and modern weights and measures, paper materials, pigments, medicines, and more. Participants were all well-known units from various regions and categories. At the entrance was a model of the Temple of Heaven in Peiping, resplendent and dazzling. The entrance to the third floor featured a carved gilded screen. Next were lacquerware, coral, ancient and modern musical instruments, bamboo and wood handicrafts, ivory carvings, jade screens, gold lacquer screens, and Phoebe zhennan wood gilded ruyi scepters from Yangzhou, Fujian, and Pingyang, Zhejiang, known worldwide, along with Qingtian stone carvings. Ancient and modern printing techniques, writing brushes, ink stones, fans, lamps, embroidered screens, and other items were all famous and valuable exhibits. A section of the National Assembly Hall was dedicated to a special exhibition of national tea, with various red and green teas, as well as Oolong and pre-Qingming teas, tea bricks, flower teas, and more, all comprehensively displayed. All tea-producing areas across the country participated, and the walls were covered with comparative charts of China tea export quantities, maps of China tea export countries, and detailed maps of tea-producing regions. From the charts, it could be seen that after 1925, China tea had plummeted in the international market, and there was an urgent need to catch up. In addition, there was a tasting room, equipped by the China National Tea Corporation, where all participants could take a short break and enjoy free tea. Adjacent to the right side of the National Assembly Hall was a handicraft sales area, with about 300 vendors, specializing in various handicrafts and food items. Famous merchants from all over the country gathered, and prices were lower than usual, so it was crowded all day long, no less than the iron exhibition sales area.</p>
<p>In addition, in order to study various handicraft manufacturing methods and improve manufacturing processes, the exhibition selected major handicrafts and created 311 various models, which were displayed realistically and exquisitely. The creation of these models was greatly assisted by the Preparatory Office of the National Central Museum. The various models are listed below, including a complete set of mule carts, three wheelbarrows, two types of human-powered waterwheels, one animal-powered waterwheel, one windmill waterwheel, a complete set of oil pressing models, a complete set of Shaoxing wine making models, a complete set of tofu making models, a complete set of iron smelting models, a complete set of textile works, a complete set of sugar making models, a complete set of paper making projects, a complete set of soy sauce brewing models, a complete set of porcelain industry models, a complete set of Yixing pottery industry models, a complete set of glazed tile works, a complete set of salt field models, ten sets of ship models, one set each of cattle and sheep skin rafts, two sets of large saddle carts and sedan chairs, one set of Taiping carts, one set of camel sedan chairs, one set of Jiawozi carts, one set of sleds, one set of ice beds, two sets of Zhou Dynasty chariots, one set of compass cars, one set of ancient mileage counting cars, various Chinese architectural models, and a complete set of glass manufacturing models. These models will serve as a reference for improving manufacturing methods, and many of the exhibits have already been purchased and can be taken away after the closing. One part has been negotiated by the Shanghai Municipal Government and will be transported to Shanghai for display during the 10th anniversary of the municipal government. All research and improvement work is said to be entrusted to Mr. Gu Yuxuan.</p>
<h3>Economic Development of North China: Agreement Reached Between the East Asia Development Company and Xingzhong Company</h3>
<p>Tokyo</p>
<p>Since Yasukawa Yunosuke took office as president of the East Asia Development Company earlier this year, he has been actively seeking to advance in North China. Yasukawa personally went to Peiping and Tianjin in May to investigate and prepare to formulate future investment plans. Afterwards, he went to Changchun to negotiate with relevant parties there. Japan's policy of developing North China is centered on the Xingzhong Company. Although the Xingzhong Company is currently in a dilemma due to difficulties in increasing capital, it is still the only channel for Japanese investment in North China to avoid competition with other Japanese companies. It is reported that Yasukawa recently reached a three-point agreement with Sogawa Shinji, president of Xingzhong Company, namely: ㊀ All investment responsibilities in North China will still be handled by Xingzhong Company; ㊁ When Xingzhong Company needs funds, the East Asia Development Company should provide loans; ㊂ All mining, cotton planting, and silk weaving businesses that the East Asia Development Company has already started to operate should continue to be handled by the East Asia Development Company. Other businesses, although the East Asia Development Company has not started operating, but has concrete plans prepared to start, should also be undertaken by the East Asia Development Company.

<h3>Tragedy Occurs During the Dragon Boat Race in Zhenjiang to Celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>More than 30 People Fall into the Water, Six Bodies Recovered</p>
<p>[Zhenjiang] Today is the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival. A boat race was held here, with nearly 100,000 spectators along the riverbank. Due to the excessive number of people, the gangplank at the Zhenjiang-Tongzhou ferry pier broke, causing more than 30 people to fall into the water. At that time, the water patrol team's lifeboats rescued more than a dozen people and recovered the bodies of six children. The rest are still being searched for. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Zhenjiang] On the abolished lunar Dragon Boat Festival, all stores in Zhenjiang closed in the afternoon. It was also a regular Sunday holiday, so the market was quite lively. Especially the dragon boat race, which had been banned for many years, was approved by the provincial police department at the request of the public. Therefore, despite the drizzling rain, the crowd watching the dragon boats by the river was still overwhelming. The police department sent two teams of police officers and water patrol teams to maintain order on the river and along the riverbank. After 3 PM, just as the dragon boat race was about to begin, the pontoon bridge built at the Zhengtong pier in front of the Jianghai Customs House suddenly broke due to the overcrowding of spectators. Spectators on the bridge fell into the water one after another. Despite emergency rescue efforts, by the time of the telegram, six drowned bodies had been recovered and more than a dozen people were injured. The search is still ongoing.

<h3>The Military Treason Case in the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union tried the treason case of eight generals, including Tukhachevsky, the day before yesterday. As the evidence of guilt was clear and all the defendants confessed, they were all sentenced to death. This event is another major case following the Zinoviev-Kamenev case last summer and the Radek case this spring, but its importance surpasses the former. According to the news from TASS yesterday, the defendants' crimes included "being employed by the military intelligence agency of a certain country that has unfriendly relations with the Soviet Union, systematically providing secret information to the military of that country, carrying out sabotage to weaken the power of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, preparing to defeat the Red Army when the Soviet Union is attacked, and deliberately assisting in the division of the Soviet Union and the restoration of the power of landlords and capitalists in the Soviet Union." These charges are, of course, more serious than the acts of treason of Zinoviev and Radek. Military treason is not only an extreme crime in the Soviet Union, but is also deserving of death in any other country.</p>
<p>However, in the eyes of countries around the world, such a major case will inevitably cause no small surprise, especially because the eight people who were sentenced this time were all high-ranking generals of the Soviet Red Army. The newspapers of Germany and Japan have taken this opportunity to issue arguments about the weakening of Soviet national defense capabilities, as if this incident is indeed quite unfavorable to the Soviet Union. However, with this possibility of being unfavorable, why did the Soviet authorities have no choice but to do this? This is indeed a topic worth studying for those of us who pay attention to international affairs. Therefore, I would like to make a brief objective analysis of this case based on my limited knowledge.</p>
<p>First. We feel that this case is not unrelated to the Soviet Union's foreign policy. According to the charges against Tukhachevsky and others, the first item mentioned that they were employed by the military intelligence agency of a certain country unfriendly to the Soviet Union, which is significant proof. Who is this so-called certain country? Everyone can understand it. According to the current international situation, Japan is less likely to attack the Soviet Union, while a certain European country poses a greater threat to the Soviet Union. Recent news from Polish newspapers says that German-Soviet relations seem to be returning to a state of rapprochement, especially because the German National Defense Force has always advocated alliance with Russia. However, this news was immediately denied by the Moscow authorities. Observing from the sidelines, we feel that this news has several functions. First, it should be deliberately released by the German side to alienate France and the Soviet Union. Second, it is said that Tukhachevsky has always had good relations with the German military. From this, we can infer that Tukhachevsky may have recently advocated being pro-German. However, Soviet policy is decided at the center, and the current Soviet policy towards Europe is to firmly maintain the French-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and pursue a path of peace. Due to errors in Tukhachevsky's understanding, he may have fallen prey to the enemy's provocation, and this error was enough to cause a treasonous act leading to his death.</p>
<p>Second. This case also shows the Soviet Union's characteristic of ruling the military through the Party. The military is guided by the Party, and the Party is based on the state's general policy. This policy can be revised at any time according to objective circumstances. In the past year or two, the Soviet Union, in view of the serious threat from aggressors, has worked hard to expand its military. During this period, there may have been relatively lenient guidance for military personnel. As a result, a few military personnel, due to errors in their political understanding or the pursuit of personal ambition, committed the great mistake of betraying the Party and selling out the country. The reform of the Soviet military district management system last month was the prelude to the centralization of military control. Following this, there was the demotion and transfer of Tukhachevsky and others, and the suicide of Gamarnik out of fear of punishment. This shows that the purging of the military through political power is proceeding step by step. Tukhachevsky and others could not avoid confessing their guilt and being punished due to their political mistakes and personal degeneration. However, during this period, the transfer of military personnel was carried out smoothly entirely under the direction of political command. This shows that the political fighting power of the Soviet army is indeed a unique feature.</p>
<p>Naturally, the most fundamental reason for this major Soviet case is still military treason. Patriots should be protected by national law, and traitors should be severely punished. This is the principle of any country, not just the Soviet Union. We should view the execution of Tukhachevsky and others in this way.</p>
<h3>U.S. Economic Committee to Discuss Abolishing the Silver Purchase Act</h3>
<p>Submitting a Memorial to the Government Explaining the Reasons</p>
<p>[Washington] The Economic Committee submitted a memorial to the U.S. government today, advocating the abolition of the Silver Purchase Act, saying that there is no reason to continue purchasing silver at high prices to subsidize U.S. silver mines, which puts financial relations in a bind. Such legalized subsidy policies are not desirable, and they have a great impact on the stability of the national currency. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Execution by Firing Squad for Eight Soviet Traitors</h3>
<p>Voroshilov Announces the Crimes, and Exhorts the Red Army to Be Loyal to the Country</p>
<p>[Moscow] Official sources have formally announced that eight high-ranking Red Army generals, including Tukhachevsky, Yakir, Uborevich, Kork, Eideman, Feldman, and Putna, have been sentenced to death by a military tribunal for treason against the state and the Red Army, and were executed by firing squad today. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today, Defense Commissar Voroshilov issued a special order to the Red Army, announcing that the military leaders sentenced to death, including General Tukhachevsky, have all been executed by firing squad. He stated that the government and the Soviet Military Council held a special meeting from June 1st to June 4th, during which he presented a report on the treasonous, counter-revolutionary, military-fascist group organized by Tukhachevsky and others. The crimes committed by Tukhachevsky, as uncovered by the Internal Affairs Commissariat, include: 1. Selling intelligence to a certain fascist country; 2. Actively promoting anti-Soviet warfare; 3. Conspiring to obstruct the transportation of war supplies to the front lines during wartime; 4. Plotting to seize Soviet power and cede Ukraine to Germany. The order concludes by urging officers and soldiers to cultivate their conscience, be loyal to the army, and thereby compensate for the damage inflicted on the country by the traitors. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Marshal Voroshilov, People's Commissar for Defense of the Soviet Union, issued a proclamation stating: "The Military Council of the People's Commissariat for Defense of the Soviet Union held a meeting from June 1st to 4th, attended by key government officials. During the meeting, my report was heard and discussed concerning the treasonous, counter-revolutionary military-fascist organization uncovered by the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs. This organization was of an absolutely conspiratorial nature and had been established for a long time. It had built bases for sabotage and espionage within the Red Army. The Red Army can now rest easy knowing that the court has delivered a just verdict on these traitors and carried out their deserved punishment. This is not the first time that the Soviet court has justly and severely punished Trotsky-Zinoviev terrorists, assault teams, spies, and assassins. These traitors, under the command of the despicable fascist traitor Trotsky, who betrays workers and peasants, use funds from foreign intelligence agencies to carry out their treasonous activities."</p>
<p>The proclamation further pointed out that among the treasonous traitors recently uncovered, there were also counter-revolutionary espionage elements who had established nests within the Red Army. The ultimate goal of these traitors was to "liquidate our country's Soviet system by all means and at any cost, destroy the Soviet regime, overthrow the government of workers and peasants, and restore the rule of landlords and capitalists in the Soviet Union. They plotted to assassinate party and government leaders, and did everything possible to maliciously sabotage the national economy and national defense, conspiring to weaken the Red Army's power and cause it to fail in future wars. They sold our country's military secrets to the enemy, damaged the Red Army's glorious military strength, and generally did everything possible to promote an enemy invasion of the Soviet Union. They prepared to use their direct acts of treason to disrupt frontline technology and material supplies, as well as operational command, causing the Red Army to collapse on the front lines and overthrow the Soviet government when war broke out. They expected the assistance of their employers in certain foreign military and fascist circles, and as the price for this assistance, they were prepared to cede Soviet Ukraine and divide our country's territory."</p>
<p>"These traitors knew well that they could not gain the support of the workers, peasants, and the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and dared not reveal their true faces. Instead, they spread deceptive schemes among the people and Red Army soldiers. However, these organizers and leaders of espionage organizations who were directly colluding with bourgeois and fascist countries' military departments have now been uncovered and punished according to the law by the Soviet judicial organs. The Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, as the loyal and reliable bulwark of the Soviet regime, has now resolutely cut off the ulcers on its healthy body and quickly cleaned them up. The Red Army was, is, and always will be an irresistible force. The Red Army will always be the flesh and blood of the people who are victoriously building a new socialist life. The entire Red Army, from soldiers to the highest commanders, was, is, and always will be a great fighting group solidified as one. In our unparalleled Red Army, there will never be a place for traitors who betray the motherland. We must increase Bolshevik vigilance tenfold, improve and fundamentally transform our work in all aspects. We must enhance self-criticism, thereby rapidly and completely liquidating the consequences of the destructive activities of the people's enemies." (TASS dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Betrayal of the Party and the Country as a Warning</h3>
<p>Editorial in Russian Pravda</p>
<p>[Moscow] Pravda's editorial states, "The Soviet Union's hundreds of millions of workers are filled with hatred upon hearing about the treasonous activities of military figures who betrayed the Party and the country. Workers, Red Army soldiers, intellectuals, and collective farmers in mass meetings throughout the country have unanimously demanded the execution of these traitors and have unanimously supported the verdicts. The vigilant eyes of the dictatorship of the working class have exposed the final military espionage core of a certain group, and its resolute hand has shattered this core, leaving no trace of it on the earth. This proves the increasing power of the Soviet system and the vigilance of the Soviet intelligence network. This also proves the panic of a certain group's intelligence agencies, even though they have years of experience in provocation, espionage, and subversive activities. All their cunning cannot help the fascist intelligence agencies operate in our Soviet Union. By crushing this last military espionage core, we have not only consolidated the Red Army's power but have also exposed all the conspiracies and schemes of a certain country. Every attempt to attack the Soviet Union will be the beginning of the end for the Goebbels-esque regime." The editorial continues, "These imperialists, especially Germany, are furious at seeing our socialist country become increasingly strong. The consistent goal of the fascist leaders of certain countries is to defeat the Red Army, divide the Soviet Union, destroy the glorious victories of the Soviet people, and turn them into slaves of fascist barbarians. This is the work that the eight fascist spies executed yesterday, the main military espionage core of a certain country, were preparing to carry out. This verdict is the voice of the Soviet people. The Soviet system has liberated hundreds of millions of oppressed people, giving them a new and happy socialist life. German imperialism is attempting to conquer and enslave these people. The shameless dreams and conspiracies of these villains will never become reality. The Soviet people and their glorious workers and peasants are an irresistible force. Today, the end of their bourgeois intelligence agencies has arrived. The Soviet people are strengthening their vigilance tenfold, and the strength of our intelligence network lies in having the entire people as its backing. The eight military spies have now been crushed at the request of hundreds of millions of people. The death of rabid dogs is indeed cause for celebration." (TASS dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Trotsky Issues Statement</h3>
<p>The Reason for the Deaths of Military Leaders: Resulting from Discord with the Army Chief</p>
<p>⊙Mexico City The anti-faction leader of the Communist Party in Mexico, Trotsky, recently made a statement to our correspondent regarding the case of the eight high-ranking generals of the Soviet Red Army who committed treason, stating, "National defense interests have been sacrificed for personal gain." General Tukhachevsky and the defendants had made outstanding achievements in leading the Red Army, and their talents were unmatched, except perhaps by Cavalry Inspector General Budyonny. As for the crimes that the Soviet government has accused the defendants of, they are not substantiated. I deeply believe that the cause of this case stems from the discord between General Tukhachevsky and People's Commissar of Defense Voroshilov. General Voroshilov is a mediocre talent who only knows how to obey Stalin's orders and has no other strengths. In short, Stalin's actions have dealt a major blow to the Red Army, and the Red Army has been shaken in spirit. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Shocked</h3>
<p>[Berlin] After the news of the execution of eight high-ranking generals of the Soviet Red Army reached here, German military figures were initially skeptical about the conflict between Soviet dictator Stalin and Red Army generals such as Tukhachevsky, but now they are greatly shocked. However, they still believe that the Red Army's reputation will not be damaged as a result. Political figures, on the other hand, believe that this move will greatly weaken the Red Army's reputation, and they anticipate that a serious reaction will occur in the Soviet political situation as a result. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] After the execution of high-ranking Soviet Red Army generals such as Tukhachevsky, German newspapers generally used the term "cruel despotism." The Lokal-Anzeiger reported that "assassination has become a principle in the Soviet Union." The Abendpost reported that the rumors of German officers attempting to communicate with Red Army leaders were absolutely false. "If people say that German officers would actually engage in such behavior, it is an insult to Germany. There is no sense in such conjecture." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Political Situation Can Be Maintained at a Moderate Level This Year</h3>
<p>The Government Tries to Avoid Friction with Political Parties; No Concrete Measures to Control Prices</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the Central News Agency correspondent returned to Tokyo, the observation of Japan's political situation is that it can generally be maintained at a moderate level this year. Although the reasons for the collapse of the Hayashi Cabinet are extremely complex, the most important reason seems to be the inability to alleviate the friction between the government and political parties, as well as the social unrest caused by rising prices. Furthermore, the Hayashi Cabinet's excessive clumsiness in handling matters increased various unnecessary frictions, which was also a reason for the overall resignation. Initially, Yuki Toyotaro's finances were praised by all parties, but because its substance was not much different from Baba Eiichi's finances, it became increasingly tinged with one-sided color, favoring capitalists and military industries, which eventually aroused opposition from all parties. On the other hand, the failure to promote the Manchurian Five-Year Plan caused the military to gradually lose faith in Yuki. In addition, Sato Naotake's diplomatic stance toward China made some feel that Sato lacked an understanding of Japan's traditional spirit toward China, so it was necessary to force his resignation. The above two points were the secondary reasons for the Hayashi Cabinet's overall resignation. The establishment of the Konoe Cabinet was to eliminate the bad phenomena left over by the Hayashi Cabinet. Therefore, the main mission of the Konoe Cabinet is to eliminate various unnecessary frictions within the country and control prices. Regarding the first point, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have currently expressed their goodwill support for the new cabinet. At the same time, the new cabinet members, starting with Konoe, have expressed no intention of organizing a new party. In that case, the existing political parties will not take an opposing attitude toward the new cabinet. Although the existing political parties hold an absolute majority in the parliament, their unity and environment also cannot allow them to realize their attempt to restore party government. Therefore, they have no choice but to temporarily maintain the so-called "right and wrongism" to deal with the current situation. For this reason, it seems that no confrontational situation will occur between the government and political parties when the special parliament is held in July. Regarding the second point, rising prices have become an inevitable trend. The large amount of excess imports necessitates the implementation of import trade control. However, controlling import trade and implementing high taxes further stimulate the rise in prices. The difference in international trade will inevitably lead to a problem, that is, how to maintain the balance of international payments. The continued soaring of prices and the excessive tax burden will inevitably lead to labor disputes demanding increased wages and worries about the instability of the general public's life will increase accordingly. The new cabinet has not yet found concrete measures to control prices. At least within ten years, Japan's military budget can only be expected to increase and not decrease. According to current rough estimates, the budget for the next fiscal year will at least break through 3.2 billion or 3.3 billion yen. Therefore, how to compile such a huge budget without increasing tax rates again is one of the most serious problems encountered by the Konoe Cabinet. Regarding diplomacy toward China, although the new cabinet wants to complete the task of adjusting relations between the two countries that the previous cabinet failed to complete, since the inconsistent factors existing in Japan have not been eliminated, it will still not accept our country's consistent desire to clear political obstacles. Therefore, if the situation in Japan does not change, there is no hope for an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, but it may not necessarily worsen. The current public opinion here regarding the Konoe Cabinet expresses less expectation than when Konoe formed the cabinet. This may be due to the many contradictory factors within Japan's political and economic layers. Therefore, it is difficult for anyone who comes forward to shoulder this great difficulty and handle this tense situation to plan policies that can satisfy the wishes of the people and conform to the trends of the times. The Konoe Cabinet faces many difficulties, let's see what brilliant plans the young prime minister has. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>The Iron Ring Defense Line is Breached; the Port of Bilbao is in Danger</h3>
<p>The Rebel Army Adopts a Dense Offensive Strategy; the Defending Army Decides to Make a Do-or-Die Stand with Reinforcements</p>
<p>⊙Bilbao After two days of fierce fighting, the Nationalist forces have breached the "Iron Ring Defense Line" of the government forces, and the fate of the Port of Bilbao has reached an irreversible stage. The so-called "Iron Ring Defense Line" is a ring of small mountains surrounding Bilbao, about seven miles from Bilbao, with three trenches built, and six layers of barbed wire in many places, including communication tunnels. Since the Nationalist forces have breached this impregnable defense line, it is expected that they will soon be able to bombard the houses in the city of Bilbao with heavy artillery. It is also reported that when the Nationalist forces attacked the "Iron Ring Defense Line," they used a dense offensive strategy, concentrating their forces in one place, forming a wedge shape that gradually penetrated. The Basque side suffered extremely heavy losses. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>⊙Bilbao The rebel army has now broken through the outer defense line of the city. The Basque president has rushed to mobilize 10,000 reservists as reinforcements. According to the rebel army's battle report, the Nationalist forces have occupied Noro village in northeastern Bilbao. Several thousand Nationalist troops, taking advantage of the high ground from Mount Vivo, are advancing directly towards Bilbao. Several rebel army planes flew over the area this afternoon and carried out large-scale bombing, killing about thirty people. (Guomin News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>⊙Bilbao The one who broke through the "Iron Ring Defense Line" of Bilbao was Colonel Valero, 38 years old, who led the First Navarre Brigade. The brigade advanced along a two-mile-wide front line, with 48 aircraft in front, densely dropping bombs and fiercely bombing. Later, in the evening, they broke through the Basque army's defense works on Mount Castelmendi and Mount Santa Maria. The Basque army, having been under intense artillery fire and aerial bombing for five hours, fought to the death to resist, but felt exhausted. At this point, their fighting spirit had declined, and they gradually retreated. According to the Nationalist army, more than 200 Basque army soldiers were killed in the battle, and 50 were captured, including one captain and one lieutenant. At the same time, the center of Bilbao city was also fiercely bombed by German-made aircraft with bombs and machine guns for an hour. Its intention was clearly to disrupt the rear while the Nationalist army continued to attack the "Iron Ring." This offensive was extremely fierce and can be called a major battle of the new era. It is estimated that 10,000 artillery shells fell on the three-mile-wide ridge defended by the Basque army, averaging one explosion every thirty seconds. According to the prisoners, the Nationalist army's artillery was mostly manufactured in Germany and Italy, and commanded by officers from those two countries. The frontline battle continued late into the night. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>

<h3>England, France, Germany, and Italy Reach Agreement on Diplomatic Note to Spain</h3>
<p>Requesting Expansion of Security Zones; Four-Nation Agreement Stipulates Four Items</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the issue of adequate guarantees for England, France, Germany, and Italy when exercising supervisory powers in Spanish territorial waters, the four governments have now reached complete agreement on the wording of the diplomatic note to be sent to the warring factions in Spain. The representatives of the four countries have agreed to send the original text to the Non-Intervention Committee as a sign of respect to the committee. The return of Germany and Italy to the Non-Intervention Committee depends on receiving answers from the warring factions. It is said that the four countries' diplomatic note to the warring factions in Spain requests that the warring factions demarcate safety zones within or near ports for foreign warships to exercise their supervisory duties. The warring factions should also solemnly guarantee that they will not attack these warships, so as to avoid any further unfortunate incidents. If an incident occurs, the four countries should consult each other on how to deal with it. It is said that in the previous negotiations among the four countries, no one had ever questioned the right of self-defense that warships should have when attacked. However, as a result of negotiations and agreement, approximately no retaliatory actions will be taken abruptly before the four countries have had adequate consultations. Furthermore, the location for future consultations among the four countries will likely remain in London, in the form of diplomatic negotiations, rather than adopting the method of a naval admiral's conference. Furthermore, after the meeting concluded yesterday, a statement was issued stating that the diplomatic notes that the four countries sent to both warring factions have been agreed upon and have been sent to the chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, requesting that he inform the representatives of the other member states. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>According to informed sources, the agreement established by England, France, Italy, and Germany stipulates four items as follows: 1. To advise the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War to expand the system of safety zones in Spanish ports as much as possible, and to guarantee that incidents similar to those that have occurred in the past few weeks will not happen again, and that foreign ships will be respected; 2. The governments of England, France, Germany, and Italy will determine the procedures for mutual consultation, and in the future, when new incidents occur, these consultation procedures must be followed before appropriate measures can be taken; 3. These consultation procedures do not abolish the right of self-defense of the warships participating in the supervision; 4. The countries agree not to engage in retaliatory actions before conducting consultations. It is also heard that the agreement recognizes the principle of joint and consistent action by the warships of all countries participating in the supervision. Any attack on any participating warship will be regarded as an attack on all countries participating in the supervision. If this situation occurs, England, France, Germany, and Italy, the four countries participating in the supervision, should conduct consultations as soon as possible, probably in London, jointly held by the British Foreign Secretary and the ambassadors to England of France, Germany, and Italy. Although the attacked warship retains the right to self-defense, it must not take retaliatory action before conducting consultations. However, the agreement does not specify what kind of disciplinary measures can be taken when new incidents occur. However, according to well-informed sources, England and France both oppose taking military retaliatory measures. In any case, the implementation of disciplinary measures can only be decided by the governments of England, France, Germany, and Italy, and should not be decided by the officers of the warships participating in the supervision. Also, if, after consultations, the injured country believes it is not satisfied, the agreement does not specify what to do. However, England, France, Germany, and Italy have agreed that if the consultations fail, the principle of joint and consistent action will be immediately cancelled when the injured country takes disciplinary measures or demands compensation independently. In this case, the other three countries will not be bound by the injured country's unilateral actions. In addition, England and France proposed the principle of making the warships participating in the supervision international in nature. After a long period of discussion, it has been accepted by Germany and Italy. As for the implementation methods of internationalization, the Adjustment Committee will decide on it in the future. It will probably be decided to have neutral inspectors board the warships participating in the supervision at any time for inspection. Regarding this level, the principles that the four countries have already agreed upon will also be notified to the warring factions in the West, in order to prove that the countries participating in the supervision are determined to avoid all new incidents.

<h3>Prime Minister of Belgium Leaves France for America</h3>
<p>International Economic Cooperation - Success or Failure Hinges on America</p>
<p>[Paris] The Prime Minister of Belgium, Paul-Henri Spaak, departed from Cherbourg, France, at 8:30 PM today aboard the steamer "Berengaria" for America. Before his departure, he gave an interview to a reporter from "Le Temps," stating that he was entrusted by the British and French governments to investigate the possibility of removing international trade barriers. Subsequently, he and his close economic advisor, Mr. Fraire, jointly conducted investigations with various European governments. The results obtained so far are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The British government expresses deep sympathy for international economic cooperation, but insists that the arms race among countries must first be fundamentally eliminated, and that the United States and Germany should participate in this economic cooperation. At present, Britain should take a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>㊁ Although France is a colonial empire and can adopt a policy of economic self-sufficiency, the French government is still prepared to make its best efforts to promote economic cooperation among countries.</p>
<p>㊂ Germany is prepared to abandon its policy of economic self-sufficiency, but only on the condition that various countries grant it certain economic concessions. The so-called economic concessions refer to the granting of long-term loans, the extensive import of German goods, and monetary and political stability. As for the path to achieving political stability, one is to recover former colonies. Among Germany's pre-war colonies, at least the Cameroons colony in Africa must be returned to Germany (Cameroons borders French Sudan and was a French mandated territory after the Great War). The second is to amend the Covenant of the League of Nations, in which Article 16 concerning sanctions should be abolished. The third is to enable German workers to be employed abroad.</p>
<p>㊃ If Italy can be granted loans by various countries to meet the needs of developing Abyssinia, Italy is also prepared to engage in economic cooperation with other countries.</p>
<p>㊄ What the Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands and Belgium require is nothing more than greater freedom for international trade. This is evidenced by the recent agreement concluded by the countries that signed the Oslo Convention.</p>
<p>In addition, Prime Minister Spaak further stated that if the goodwill of the governments of various countries is to be realized, it is still necessary to obtain various necessary conditions. For example, Germany must revalue and stabilize its mark, and other countries must grant Germany loans as reserves. In short, if the economies of various countries are to be stable and their currencies are stable, they must go through a period of rectification. During this period, countries with excessive gold reserves should lend to countries with depleted reserves. As for the current currencies of various countries, Austria is the most sound, because Austria has a regional agreement with Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Austria first allows prices to be completely consistent at home and abroad. As for Belgium, it is the only country to maintain the gold standard exchange system. In the future, it is hoped that other countries will also restore the gold standard uniformly. However, if the stability of general currencies is to be achieved, it still depends on the clarification of the general situation. Finally, Spaak added that the success or failure of international economic cooperation really depends on the decision-making power of the United States. Therefore, this trip to the United States is extremely important. If the results of the inspection in the United States are quite smooth, he also intends to study the situation in the Soviet Union and Japan. (Central News Agency, 12th, Havas dispatch)</p>

We should now, based on the cooperation of these friendly countries, namely Italy and Austria, continue to promote the peaceful evolution of Central Europe and our two countries." Neurath replied, "Germany and Hungary have a traditional friendship, and we sincerely hope to enhance it. The harmony of the Central European countries depends on the cooperation between our two countries," etc. (Central News Agency, 12th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Czech Prime Minister to Return Visit to Romanian Capital</h3>
<p>⊙Czechoslovakia Czech Prime Minister Hodža, at the invitation of King Carol of Romania, is scheduled to go to Romania tomorrow evening to return the visit of Prime Minister Tătărescu of Romania in March of this year. According to those in charge, the purpose of Hodža's trip is to establish an economic understanding with Romania, so that Romania will supply Czechoslovakia with oil, and Czechoslovakia will supply Romania with munitions. In addition, the Chief of General Staff of Yugoslavia, General Martić, recently visited Czechoslovakia. Therefore, it is generally believed that another purpose of Prime Minister Hodža's trip is to promote the establishment of military cooperation between the two countries of Czechoslovakia and Romania within the scope of the Little Entente. As for the Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries, it will be held after Prime Minister Hodža has completed his talks with the Romanian authorities in order to discuss the organization of the Danube River basin.

<h3>Lenin's Sister Passes Away</h3>
<p>[Moscow] Lenin's sister, Madame Ulyanova, passed away yesterday at 1:50 PM from cerebral hemorrhage at the age of fifty-nine. Ulyanova was born in Simbirsk in 1878 and participated in the revolutionary movement in her early years. In 1899, she was arrested and imprisoned in Moscow. Although she was released later, she was still pursued by the Tsarist police and was arrested several times. From the revolution in 1917 to 1929, she worked diligently for the Communist Party's newspaper Pravda. From 1925 to 1934, she served as a member of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Communist Party. After 1934, she served as a member of the Supervisory Committee of the Soviet People's Committee. In 1933, she was awarded the Order of Lenin by the government for her meritorious service in handling workers' and peasants' education affairs. (Central News Agency, 13th, Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Puppet Bandits in Chahar North Continue to Revolt</h3>
<p>The Kangbao Police Squad Mutinies with Weapons - The Zhangbei Guards Also Plan to Join the Resistance - The Number of Martyrs Among the Righteous People Has Reached Over a Hundred - The Number of Those Implicated and Arrested Has Reached Over Seven Hundred</p>
<p>A dispatch from Wanquan states that since the people of Chahar North rose up to defend themselves on the first of this month, the puppet bandit army has seen a certain party engaging in a great deal of slaughter, arousing their conscience, and those who mutiny with weapons and refuse to be accomplices are constantly emerging. On the sixth of this month, the police squad of Kangbao County, numbering about a hundred, also mutinied with weapons in response to the righteous people of Chahar North. Unfortunately, it was too late, and the uprising was suppressed by the puppet army in less than two days. On the same day, a company of soldiers guarding the east gate of Zhangbei County town, under Bao Zichen's command, also mutinied with weapons, planning to escape into the mountains west of Rehe to wait for an opportunity to repay the nation. A certain secret service organization learned of this and immediately ordered a certain army's armored vehicle team to track and pursue them. They were caught up with in the wilderness of Yizhi, Chongli County. A conflict immediately broke out. Because the company of soldiers had few bullets, they were surrounded by a certain army's armored vehicle team after holding out for three hours and were all brutally murdered.</p>
<p>Recently, in view of the change in military and popular sentiment in Chahar North, a certain party has been trying to suppress it by all means. On the one hand, it has issued a general order to the puppet bandits' armies that all firearms, except for those used for sentry duty, should be sealed up by the heads of each unit every night and issued again during morning exercises the next day. Bao Zichen's unit in Zhangbei has been implementing this since the ninth of this month. On the other hand, they are restricting privately held firearms among the people. The various counties are now issuing orders to the people that all those who have firearms in their possession must report and inspect them within ten days. Those who conceal and fail to report them after the deadline will be charged with secretly possessing military supplies with the intention of revolt and will be executed.</p>
<p>According to sources from a certain related party, the number of righteous people who died in this self-defense by the people of Chahar North from the first to the ninth of this month in Chongli Xiangdousha Village, Zhangbei County Town, Kangbao County Town, and Nanhouchun and other places totaled more than one hundred. The number of those implicated and arrested on suspicion reached more than seven hundred, many of whom were families who generously went to their deaths together, and there were also families who were detained by a certain party and are currently being interrogated. Their spirit of refusing to submit for long and sacrificing their lives and property to seek survival and freedom is truly admirable. Unfortunately, they had no support, which led to this tragic tragedy, which only makes future generations tear their eyes and stand on end.</p>
<p>Since the self-defense of the people of Chahar North was suppressed, a certain secret service organization in Zhangbei has specially dispatched a large number of traitors to various places to gather information in order to understand the emotions of the people and the military and political situation in our inland areas. Between the fifth, sixth, and ninth of this month, a total of more than thirty traitors were dispatched from Zhangbei in succession. It is said that their destinations were designated as Suidong, Xinghe, Pingdiquan, and Zhangjiakou, and some of them went to Wuchuan, Guyang, and Taolin in Suibei via Shangdu. (June 10)</p>
<h3>The Xinzhong Corporation's He River Entering Jin Has a Major Mission</h3>
<p>To Inquire into the Intentions of the Shanxi Authorities and Inspect Mineral Deposits - To Make a Final Evaluation of the Construction of the Jinshi Road</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin states that Shinji Sogō, the president of the Japanese Xinzhong Corporation, has been running between Pingjin and Dalian since the middle of last month, working on so-called North China economic development. On the tenth of this month, he took the company's general manager, Hideichi Hojo, and secretary, Yō Yoshida, from Beiping to Taiyuan to visit Zhao Daiwen and Zhu Shouguang, hoping to pay his respects to the cabinet for a discussion. It is reported that Sogo's trip to Shanxi is to test the intentions of the Shanxi authorities on the one hand, and to seek profits in the process, and to inspect coal, iron, mineral deposits, and emerging industries on the other hand. The task is very important. The recent North China economic development issue has been intermittent. Those who do not know the situation may suspect that it has stalled. For example, the Jinshi Road and Longyan Mine incidents have been discussed by the Chinese and Japanese persons in charge for two years, but there is still no progress. The reasons for this are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The Japanese Army Command in Tianjin has devoted two years to the Jinshi Road and Longyan Mine incidents, but the financial groups are hesitant to invest, and it has not been successful. The military headquarters itself sees this as a major loss. This spring, Ikeda, the economic section chief of the Japanese Army Command, and Hashimoto, the chief of staff, returned to Japan one after another to lobby, pulling out the Oriental Development Company to invest. Yasukawa Yunosuke, the president of Dongtuo, came to China for inspection. However, when the military headquarters, Manchu Railway, and Xinzhong held a North China economic development forum in Dalian on the 13th of last month, the military representatives Ikeda and Adachi first proposed that Dongtuo wanted to invest in North China alone, which was strongly opposed by the Manchu Railway and Xinzhong Corporation, which was sheltered by the Manchu Railway. The meeting was equal to no result and ended unhappily. The two financial groups, Shanxing Zhongdongtuo, have a situation in North China where they cannot coexist. Therefore, Xinzhong Corporation, while preventing the intrusion of Dongtuo's forces, advocated increasing capital to 50 million yuan to break away from the Manchu Railway and become independent. This matter is still pending.</p>
<p>㊁ Among the so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China, only the export of Luyan to Japan and the Sino-Japanese navigation between Hebei and Chahar have been implemented. The Central Government has stated that there is no need to build the Jinshi Road. Even if it is built, it must be handled under the auspices of the Ministry of Railways. The Hebei-Chahar authorities have always obeyed the Central Government and should have no objection to this. However, the Japanese side is difficult to abandon the construction of the Jinshi Road lightly. The Japanese side's intention to build the road is to transport various mineral deposits from Shanxi Province on the one hand, and to support Japanese forces in the villages along the route on the other hand. Sogo's visit to Shanxi this time is to make a final assessment of the economic value of the Jinshi Road to determine whether there is a need to build it desperately. As for the exploitation of the Longyan Mine, it is estimated that an investment of 10 million yuan is required before iron can be produced. However, according to the Japanese side, the Longyan Mine is old and its efficiency is poor. Therefore, the Japanese side has also investigated the Jinling Iron Mine in Shandong and the Anshan Iron Mine in Puppet Manchukuo. Regardless of whether it can be mined, the dependence on the Longyan Mine has been reduced.</p>
<p>The Japanese side knows that the problems of building the Jinshi Road, the Longyan Iron Mine, and the Tanggu Port are not easy to handle. Recently, there have been two plans to improve wool and counter-planting cotton, taking the easy way. The Xinzhong Corporation has been purchasing land in Junliangcheng, east of Tianjin, numbering about 40,000 to 50,000 acres, planning to open it up as a cotton planting area to try to plant American cotton to supply the needs of Japanese yarn factories in Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan. The expert Takahashi is responsible for presiding over the project. On the one hand, a cotton warehouse is being built in Tianjin to purchase cotton from various counties in Hebei Province. The capital is set at 9 million yuan. This matter may be realized within a month. As for the improvement of wool, it is done by the Japanese Shovel Spinning Company, which opens up a vast pasture in Zhangjiakou, Chahar Province, or other suitable locations to breed sheep to manipulate the foundation of wool.

<p>Chen Kunyuan, One of the Four Great Kings, is Arrested - Chen's Wife Opens Fire and Wounds a Detective from the Japanese Police Station</p>
<p>A dispatch from Tianjin states that recently, the Japanese resident agencies in North China seem to be paying attention to the work of clearing drugs. One reason is that after the Hahe floating corpse case occurred, general opinion mostly pointed out that it was done by a drug trafficking organization under Japanese protection. Another reason is that international opinion recently believes that Japan is protecting drug manufacturing organizations in North China, producing in large quantities, distributing drugs in North China, and dumping them to the world. The Japanese side wants to save face and, since there is no way to defend the former rumors, it has no choice but to engage in sanctions and clean up the organizations under its jurisdiction that manufacture and sell drugs in order to quell world opinion. Kato, the chargé d'affaires of the Japanese Embassy in Beiping, had already visited and expressed his determination to crack down on drug trading firms. This is the Japanese side's recent awakening to launch a crackdown.</p>
<p>The Japanese Concession in Tianjin has always been known to the world as a den for manufacturing drugs. Since this month, the Japanese police station has sealed up dozens of white powder houses based on the purpose of cracking down on drugs, and arrested more than a thousand drug addicts, who were extradited to our police station in batches. The police station then transferred them to the municipal relief center. The number of guests received by the hospital exceeded the quota, and it was temporarily full. In addition to this measure, the Japanese police station also investigated drug manufacturing and trafficking organizations. Chen Heling (Zi Kunyuan), a Shanghainese, 48 years old, is one of the four great kings of drug manufacturing and trafficking in North China. In the past, he partnered with someone surnamed Jia, who had been executed in Shanghai for drug trafficking, to operate a drug den. When the incident occurred, Jia was executed and Chen fled to Tianjin with his wife, Wang (39 years old), and moved to the Japanese Concession. Later, he and Wu Jiyuan (that is, Wu Ji Jade) set up a drug manufacturing machine in Beiping. It was broken by the military police the year before last. Chen independently set up Kangchang Foreign Firm on Shou Street in the Japanese Concession in Tianjin, hiring Japanese Ronin Okada and others to use their names to manufacture and sell drugs in large quantities. He also opened rooms 56, 57, 62, etc. in Deyi Building in the Japanese Concession as a retail sales agency, and used Tang Amao and dozens of others as outside sales interceptors. All the major cities of Taiyuan, Sui, Cha, Hebei, Shandong, and Tangshanbeiping have secret rental transfer agencies. It is really a giant drug manufacturing den in North China. The production and sales are so widespread that those who hear it are shocked. Chen has accumulated millions of evils because of this. He and his wife live in luxury in the Japanese Concession at No. 2, 44 Kamo Street, Suma Street, almost like a prince. He has one son, two daughters, and the daughters are studying in a middle school in Tianjin, and the son is studying in Shanghai. At 7:30 am on the 10th of this month, the Japanese police station suddenly dispatched patrolman Yamayo to lead five detectives and broke into Chen's residence on Kamo Street. At that time, Chen had not yet gotten up. The Japanese police went straight into the bedroom and captured him. When Chen was arrested, he was still confident that he was generous and not very panicked. His wife was awakened from her sleep and, because Yamayo and others were all in plain clothes, suspected that they were bandits kidnapping him, and quickly took Chen's own pistol from the back room and fired three shots in a row, hitting Yamayo in the abdomen and arm with two bullets. Another bullet grazed a detective's arm. The Japanese detectives worked together to snatch the pistol. The Chens were then tied up and taken to the Japanese police station. The chief of the Japanese police station, Wakui, was very angry that the detectives were injured and immediately dispatched a large team of detectives to search Deyi Building and Kangchang Foreign Firm. Drugs and utensils were found in the 56, 7, and 62 rooms of Beiyi Building and loaded into four heavy trucks. The manufacturing materials and machines were also found in Kangchang Foreign Firm. Ronin Okada and Tang Amao and others fled. How the Japanese side will deal with the criminal is still under investigation. After Chen was arrested, the society cheered for a while (10th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Demolition of Houses Limited for Road Expansion</p>
<p>The Construction Bureau has decided to expand the ten major arterial roads in and outside the Xuanwu City, and construction is imminent. Residents on both sides of the road have been notified long ago to report the demolition by September 30. Currently, many people have reported the demolition in compliance with the order, but there are also many who are procrastinating and waiting to see. In order to facilitate the project, the Construction Bureau has decided to forcibly limit the demolition of houses, otherwise the Construction Bureau will decide to demolish them on its behalf.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Factory Coal Panic</p>
<p>Wuxi is a factory area, and it needs about 600 tons of rare coal every day. However, the arrival of goods is rare and difficult to cope with. The reasons are that the Huaitong, Datong, and Zhongxing coal mining companies are mostly short of vehicles for loading and transporting, so the market price has soared. The former coal price was about ten yuan per ton, and now it is sold for fifteen or sixteen yuan per ton. The factories are very enthusiastic. If no coal arrives in the yard within half a month, there is a danger of the factory stopping.</p>
<p>Rain Affects Wheat</p>
<p>Two-thirds of the wheat in the four townships has already been harvested. The farmers are happy because they estimate that the harvest is still good. However, the recent weather has not been good, and the overcast rain has continued, causing the wheat in the fields to germinate, and the harvested wheat is at risk of mildew due to excessive temperature. It rained heavily all day on the 13th, and water accumulated in the fields, forming canals and pouring into the river. The farmers are very worried. If it does not clear up again, the losses will not be small.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Levy of Improvement Fees for Silkworm Cocoons</p>
<p>About 10,000 sheets of Jiangdu spring silkworm species are sold, and the rearing has all been on the cluster. Currently, Yang Rennong, the director and instructor of the Central Guidance Institute, said that the cocoon houses in the third district have already dried the fresh cocoons they have collected, and the weighing will be done soon. He specially accompanied the staff of Jiangsu Bank to the area on the 12th to collect the improvement fee of six yuan per stone to report and resolve.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Suppression of Bandits Command Established</p>
<p>The 6th Security Command of Ningbo, in order to take advantage of the scattered disturbances and affect the security of the border between the three counties of Fengshengduan, specially set up the Fengningxinsheng four-county suppression of bandits command in Fenghua Shidi Lidi. The Deputy Commander Chen Ximin was appointed as the commander of the bandit suppression. Deputy Commander Chen went to Ershi on the morning of the 11th to deploy the affairs of the department, and the office was opened on the same day.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Local Cloth Silver Group Established</p>
<p>The banking industry in Shanghai developed the local cloth in various counties in the Nantong area and formed a local cloth silver group, investing 1.25 million yuan in one year. The loan plan has now been agreed upon. On the 12th, Ge Tan, the director of the Nantong Local Cloth Improvement Committee, went to Shanghai to sign a contract with the local cloth silver group.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Interception of Smuggled Fertilizer Powder</p>
<p>At about 7:00 am on the 7th of this month, Zhang Cipan, a Dali person from Yueqing, was found at Jiangxiali, Xiling District, Shanghai, smuggling 28 bags of fertilizer powder. He was loaded into a pier after someone reported to Tianhexi Township Office, who sent people to check. It was confirmed that it was tax-evading chemical fertilizer powder. The smuggled goods were intercepted outside the township office, and the county government was notified to request a solution.</p>

Over a hundred people attended, including members of the past two executive and supervisory committees and guests from various organizations. The meeting commenced with a bell at 3:00 PM and adjourned after 5:00 PM. Afterwards, representatives were dispatched to various radio stations to speak about the significance of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>

<p>Committee Members: Zhu Wende, Zhang Bingjun, Tian Heming, Xu Zuoliang, Le Junwei, Qian Jianqiu, Qian Ying, Wu Dong, Zheng Wentong, Guo Qiming, Cha Renwei, Shen Yingshi, Yang Minshi, Li Wenjie, Yin Yong, Shi Naixiu, Li Aokui, Fang Junjie, Zhu Kuangzheng, Li Baosen, Zhu Su'e, Zhou Shiying, Gu Changyuan, Zhang Juansheng, Zhu Fujun, Qin Zemin, Qu Yue, Cai Zhaohuang, Wang Weizhen, Chen Zhigao, Yuan Yangan, Feng Meixue, Chen Chaojun, Yu Chengxiu, Le Junying, Wang Manyun, Yan Yinwu, Yao Fuyuan, Jiang Huiruo, Min Xianzhang, Zhang Tianbai, etc.</p>
<p>Details of the Meeting</p>
<p>The meeting commenced at 3:00 PM. Chen Zhigao, Xu Zuoliang, Yan Yinwu, Zhu Wende, Yu Chengxiu, Zhang Juansheng, and Yuan Yangan were publicly elected to form the presidium. All attendees stood at attention and paid the highest respect to the Party and National Flags and the portrait of Sun Yat-sen. The chairman solemnly read the will. Presidium members Xu Zuoliang, Chen Zhigao, and Yan Yinwu successively reported on the purpose of the meeting and the progress of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement, stating that the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement had been resolved and adopted at the Judicial Conference. It has been submitted to the Legislative Yuan for initial drafting, which is now complete and will be submitted to the Criminal Law Committee. Today, the Third Anniversary Movement Conference is held, inviting various organizations to attend, participate in unity, and cooperate to urge the government to formulate wrongful imprisonment compensation regulations and promulgate them for implementation to rescue the wrongfully accused people. Next, Mr. Wang Xiaolai spoke, hoping that the term "wrongful imprisonment" would be used more directly, and that this compensation was only a form of comfort. Why quibble over the words? Next, Chief Judge Qiao Wanxuan stated that wrongful imprisonment compensation has been implemented in advanced countries, and China should also formulate it. However, even with this law, it is still hoped that wrongful imprisonments will be reduced. To reduce the practical requirements for wrongful imprisonment, one is for prosecutors to reduce the prosecution of cases, and the second is to strictly enforce bail. If wrongful imprisonments can be reduced, and the legal profession can assist, wrongful imprisonments can definitely be prevented from happening. Everyone applauded. Subsequently, guests Lin Wopeng from the Second Branch of the High Court, Du Baoxin from the Shanghai Local Court, Qu Shaoheng and Wei Bozhen from the Municipal Medical Association, and others successively spoke, all expressing their support for this system, ultimately hoping to achieve a state where there are no wrongful imprisonments and no need for compensation. Next, Committee members Wang Weizhen, Cha Renwei, Tian Heming, Feng Meixue, Yu Chengxiu, Yuan Yangan, and others successively spoke, proposing four motions for discussion: (A) Requesting the government to announce the draft Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law; (B) Seeking opinions from all parties; (C) Requesting the passage of Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Regulations and appointing representatives to attend; (D) Promulgating and implementing the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Regulations as soon as possible. For the above motions, it was resolved to appoint seven representatives to be handled by the Executive and Supervisory Committee. The meeting adjourned with tea and refreshments. The atmosphere was quite enthusiastic that day, and the opinions expressed were very practical.</p>
<p>Radio Broadcasts</p>
<p>Eleven people went to various radio stations to speak, including Chen Zhigao, Yan Yinwu, Yu Chengxiu, Zhu Kuangzheng, Chen Kunyuan, Tian Heming, Zheng Aokui, Le Junwei, Sun Zuji, Zhang Juansheng, and Zhang Tianbai.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili Ran Aground at Shipu En Route from Guangzhou to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Encountering Danger Due to Heavy Fog Obscuring the Waterway, Haiyan Rushed to the Rescue, Passengers Arriving in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili ran aground in Hong Kong on October 21 and was only recently rescued. Not even two weeks later, the Haili encountered danger again. The Haili is a sister ship to the Haiwu. This time, en route from Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and Shantou back to Shanghai, the ship collided with a reef in the waters off Zhejiang due to heavy fog. The ship sustained damage and began taking on water. All passengers on board are expected to be rescued and returned to Shanghai today. The general situation is described below:</p>
<p>Encountering Danger Near Shipu</p>
<p>The Haili is the regular vessel on the South China line. This time, it was fully loaded with cargo and passengers from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shantou, sailing back to Shanghai. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but the ship encountered severe weather yesterday morning while sailing in the waters off Zhejiang, near Shipu. Heavy fog obscured the waterway, causing the ship to collide with a submerged reef. As the ship continued to move forward, the iron plates of the hull were torn by the reef, causing significant damage. Seawater immediately flooded into the hold, creating a very dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Ship Owner Cables Shanghai for Help</p>
<p>After the accident, the passengers on board were extremely uneasy. The captain telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters for help, hoping to safely return the passengers on board to Shanghai first, and then repair the damaged hull and attempt to sail back to Shanghai for repairs. Upon receiving the telegram, the general and deputy managers and department heads immediately discussed rescue measures, as yesterday was a Sunday and also the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>Haiyan Dispatched to Rescue Passengers</p>
<p>After discussion among the staff, it was decided that sending a ship from Shanghai would cause delays during this tense situation. Therefore, after consultation among the responsible personnel, in order to act quickly and deal with the emergency, the Haiyan, which was currently in Wenzhou, was dispatched to assist the passengers on board. The head of the Wenzhou branch was also ordered to accompany the Haiyan to preside over the rescue. After the decision was made, a telegram was immediately sent to the Wenzhou branch to implement it quickly.</p>
<p>Passengers Expected to Arrive Today</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, another telegram was received from the Haili, stating that the Haiyan sent from Wenzhou had arrived near Shipu and had begun transferring all the passengers from the Haili to the Haiyan in batches using sampans. It was ordered to send them back to Shanghai first. It is expected that the Haiyan will be able to safely transport all the passengers from the Haili to Shanghai today. Furthermore, as the weather had gradually improved yesterday afternoon, the Haili's hull repair and sailing to Shanghai could proceed smoothly without major danger.</p>
<p>Overall Structure of the Ship</p>
<p>The Haili is one of the four new ships built with the Boxer Indemnity funds. The ship has a gross tonnage of 3,395 tons, a registered tonnage of 2,055 tons, and a cargo capacity of 200,400 cubic feet. It is 343 feet long, 47 feet wide, with a draft of 17 feet 6 and 3/8 inches. It has a horsepower of 2,500 and can travel at 13.6 nautical miles per hour. It has 14 first-class cabins, 18 second-class cabins, 40 third-class cabins, and 56 berths and 600 unberthed spaces in third class. The ship cost 1.4 million yuan and is currently insured for 1.12 million yuan.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin Discusses the Reorganization of Military Affairs in Sichuan and Xikang</h3>
<p>Implementing in Full Accordance with the Central Government's Established Policies, Date of My Departure to Sichuan Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin, accompanied by Secretary Xie Zongyuan and Adjutant Zhang Guozhong, arrived in Shanghai by train on the evening of the 12th. Songhu Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Municipal Security Corps Commander Ji Zhangjian, and Municipal Police Chief Cai Jinjun all went to pay their respects. Yesterday afternoon at 5:00 PM, he went to Renjitang on Yunnan Road to preside over the Guizhou Disaster Relief Conference and discuss relief efforts. A reporter from the New News Agency visited him to inquire about the measures for reorganizing military affairs in Sichuan and Xikang, and when he would depart for Sichuan. According to He, the steps for reorganizing military affairs in Sichuan and Xikang will be decided entirely in accordance with the Central Government's established policies. The general situation was discussed and published by myself in Nanjing, and there have been no changes to date, so there is no need to repeat it. Guan Jiyu, the Central Financial Commissioner to Sichuan, has not met with me after visiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Lushan. I have also not met with Lu Zuofu, the Director of Construction of Sichuan Province. Because Lu's whereabouts have only been seen in the newspapers, his actual whereabouts cannot be confirmed. As for the Central Government sending me to Sichuan to preside over the reorganization of military affairs, the rumors that Wu Daquan and Zhang Qun will accompany me are probably just external speculation, as I am not aware of it, so there is no point in discussing when I might depart for Sichuan. This trip to Shanghai is purely for Guizhou disaster relief matters and requires consultation with various parties in Shanghai to discuss methods, and I plan to return to Nanjing in a day or two.</p>
<h3>Energy Conservation Movement Closed Last Night</h3>
<p>An Evening Entertainment Show Was Also Held</p>
<p>The Energy Conservation Movement, sponsored by the Chinese YMCA, has been open since the 4th of this month and has lasted for many days.

In total, several thousand people attended the lectures. Yesterday was the last day of the exhibition for the movement. In addition to the exhibition being open for viewing all day, a grand entertainment show for the Energy Conservation Movement Week was held in the auditorium on the second floor of the YMCA at Baxianqiao from 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM to add to the fun. The program was as follows: (1) National Music (Zhi Lan Society), (2) National Martial Arts Performance (YMCA Martial Arts Group), (3) Solo Performance (Jiang Xiaoxiao, Bao Lele), (4) Technique (Deng Guoqing), (5) Magic (Xu Jingyun), (6) Crosstalk (YMCA Jing Zhi Troupe), (7) Scout Skills (Pan Delin). The event was closed immediately after the show.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying Will Go to Lushan Today to Meet with Chiang Kai-shek</h3>
<p>Mao Heyuan Hosts a Farewell Banquet</p>
<p>Former Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying suffered from otitis media and sought treatment from otolaryngologist Li Gang, who has already recovered. However, his energy was weakened after the illness. He was prescribed a body-strengthening and blood-nourishing medicine specially made from umbelliferous plants by the famous national doctor Fei Zibin, as well as Fei's created dietary therapy. He was instructed to take a small amount of chicken broth and several Xinghua longans every day. It has been quite effective in recent days, and he has fully recovered his health. As Xu will soon return to his post, it is necessary to ask Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions regarding future foreign policy toward Japan. He received a telegram from Chiang yesterday inviting him to meet in Lushan. Xu is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 14th to receive instructions. He will stay for several days and then go to Nanjing to discuss everything with Foreign Minister Wang and prepare for departure abroad. He is scheduled to return to his post on the American mail ship President Hoover on the 29th of this month. Mao Heyuan, a Ningbo businessman in Shanghai, hosted a farewell banquet for Ambassador Xu at his residence on Fuli Road last night.

After being appointed, Mr. Friis is scheduled to travel to Nanjing with his entourage this week to pay his respects to Foreign Minister Wang and discuss the date for presenting his credentials. Mr. Friis has lived in China for many years and is quite familiar with the situation in the Far East.</p>
<h3>Liu Hangchen and Guan Jiyu Will Fly to Sichuan Tomorrow to Report Back</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Has a Handwritten Letter to Liu Xiang</p>
<p>Sichuan Provincial Financial Commissioner Guan Jiyu visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Kuling and flew to Nanjing.

The two representatives of Liu Xiang went to Nanjing this time to meet with the authorities and discuss the plan to reorganize the Sichuan army. The result was very satisfactory. Once He Yingqin, the senior official in charge of military reorganization, enters Sichuan, the work can begin. It is also reported that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has a handwritten letter to Liu Xiang, which will be carried by Liu and Guan to be delivered.</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Docked at the Qiujiang Wharf for the First Time Yesterday</h3>
<p>Japanese Empress Docks in Shanghai En Route to Japan, Wharf Workers Work Exceptionally Efficiently</p>
<p>After the completion of the first phase of the Qiujiang Wharf project, it was put into operation on the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the British-owned Changxing Shipping Company's giant Japanese Empress arrived in Shanghai and docked at the wharf. Due to its perfect facilities and the skilled workers, the passengers were all satisfied. The ship will set sail from Shanghai tomorrow afternoon. On the 21st, the Italian mail ship Conte Rosso will dock at the wharf. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Wharf Transportation Facilities</p>
<p>The Japanese Empress is a giant ship that sails the Far East line. Each time it arrives in China, it docks in the Huangpu River, and passengers have to spend a long time going back and forth, which is particularly inconvenient. Now that the newly built Qiujiang Wharf is being used, all the difficulties have been resolved. Furthermore, the Qiujiang Wharf Management Office has fully prepared all the transportation tools to facilitate passengers. The magnificence of the wharf construction is also a major event. Behind the wharf, there is a large open space that can accommodate hundreds of cars. Silver taxis and Chinese-owned public buses that have been specially contracted by the management office, numbering more than a hundred, are also parked in the square for passengers to hire. As for the traffic in the square, twenty staff members and dozens of police officers are stationed to maintain order, and there is no chaotic scene.</p>
<p>Reception and Waiting Facilities</p>
<p>The management office originally stipulated that only those waiting to receive guests would be allowed to wait upstairs in order to facilitate the work of the wharf. The office has prepared tables and chairs for guests to rest and talk to passengers over the railing, but the space seems to be rather narrow. Although it was raining yesterday, there was an unusually large crowd of Chinese and foreign people waiting there. Those who came later had no room to stand. There were also many people braving the rain on the roof of the cargo warehouse to the left. However, children were prohibited from standing there to prevent accidents. As for the customs inspection room on the wharf, where guests were originally not allowed to enter, a temporary arrangement was made after receiving notification from the customs, so those with customs passes could still enter. There were also many people braving the rain and standing on the wharf.</p>
<p>Mooring Situation</p>
<p>The ship arrived at the wharf at 2:30 PM. Two management staff members led five sailors and more than a hundred workers to work at the pier. The procedures were very efficient, and it was moored in about half an hour. The Chinese and foreign people who came to pick up guests immediately went up the stairs to board the ship. The ship carried 580 passengers, of whom 231 came to Shanghai from various places. The remaining 349 were transit passengers who disembarked with their relatives and friends to hire cars to visit the city. They will still take the original ship to Japan this afternoon. It is reported that the ship only brought a few hundred baskets of tropical fruits. According to the person in charge of the management office, the wharf's facilities and work can be said to be satisfactory. The ship's freshwater needs were also supplied by the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant at 40 cents per ton. The China Travel Service handles all the needs of passengers. The next ship to dock at the wharf will be the Italian ship Conte Rosso, scheduled for the 21st. The time needs to be confirmed on the 19th.</p>

<h3>New Consul to Medan, Lei Bingyang, Will Go to Medan</h3>
<p>Former Consul Huang Tianmai Has Returned to China</p>
<p>Medan is the only major port on the island of Sumatra in the Dutch East Indies. There are approximately 40,000 overseas Chinese residents. Although the area is not large, it is particularly important. Since Consul Huang Zheng (Tianmai) was ordered to be transferred to Paris, France, as Consul General, it is now known that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has appointed Lei Bingyang, Consul to Johannesburg, South Africa, as Consul to Medan. It is reported that Lei will go to Medan within the month to take up his new post.</p>
<h3>Industrial Arts Delegation Departed for Nanjing Last Night to Visit</h3>
<p>Organized by the Local Association and the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The local association and the municipal chamber of commerce of this city, considering the fine quality of the exhibits at the National Handicraft Exhibition held in the capital, which could serve as models for observation, and responding to the invitation of the Ministry of Industry, have separately organized visiting delegations. The local association's delegation includes Lin Kanghou, Luo Qinghua, Wang Boyuan, Wu Kaisheng, Zhu Shaoping, Cai Renbao, Wang Kui Sheng, and other seven people. Lin Kanghou was elected as the leader of the delegation. The chamber of commerce's side has five members, led by Wang Xiaolai, representing the Chamber, and Jin Runxiang. They all took the Nanjing-Shanghai night express train together last night at 11:00 PM, and are scheduled to visit the exhibition at 2:00 PM this afternoon, and return to Shanghai by train tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Lin Jinyu Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday to Attend the Audit Conference</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Audit established audit offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hubei, Shanghai, and other four places and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway audit office in 1935, it has spared no effort in promoting accounting policies. Last year, audit offices in Shaanxi, Henan, Guangdong, and other provinces were also successively established. Minister Lin Yunhai personally went to various places for inspection earlier this month, and has returned to Nanjing after the completion of the official duties.

<h3>Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce to Hold National Products Promotion Fair</h3>

<p>The Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Nanyang, having successfully held national products exhibitions in the past two years, which greatly aided the promotion of national goods, with the national product sector in this city also participating, and with Double Ten Day approaching soon, in order to fulfill the mission of developing national products, the Chamber will continue to hold the third large-scale National Products Exhibition and Promotion Fair. Manufacturers of national goods from both domestic and overseas locations are invited to participate. According to a reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency, it was learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce has already established a preparatory committee and will soon dispatch its director, Lin Ziming, along with participation regulations, etc., to return to the country to collect products. It is expected he will arrive in Shanghai soon. It is heard that quite a few businesses in the local national products sector intend to participate.

<h3>Deadlock in Yarn Trading Speculation Dispute Being Resolved</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng Advises Both Sides to Eliminate Prejudices; Government to Take Decisive Action When Necessary</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports: The yarn trading market turmoil led to the Ministry sending Vice Minister Cheng Tiangu to Shanghai to investigate and handle the matter. After summoning buyers, sellers, and brokers for talks, many brokers sent letters to seek opinions. It was decided that negotiations would continue this morning, but the sellers insisted on their original stance and refused to concede. Du Yuesheng is currently trying to mediate. If there is no solution, the Ministry will decisively deal with the situation by using the Exchange Act. Here is a record of the general sentiment:</p>
<p>Buyers Maintain a Firm Attitude</p>
<p>Since Vice Minister Cheng summoned representatives from both buying and selling brokers, as well as neutral representatives from the Exchange Council and the Brokers Association, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, the buying brokers stated that they needed to consult with their clients to reply, because the selling brokers could not represent the opinions of the buying clients. Therefore, they immediately issued written letters overnight to seek opinions from the buyers. It has now been learned from relevant sources that the buyers (i.e., the buying side) are still firmly adhering to their original proposal and cannot accept a market price below the red card price of June 8th. It is currently found that the buyers hold more than 80,000 pieces of yarn in futures contracts for June, July, August, and September, and there are also more than 23,000 pieces in spot goods.</p>
<p>Du Visits Cheng for Discussions</p>
<p>After the selling brokers invited Du Yuesheng to mediate, the market was reopened on the morning of the 11th, with the buying side releasing 29,900 pieces of near and far-term individual yarns to maintain the market. Unexpectedly, the next morning, the buying side suddenly called for a higher market price, causing the market to be forced to suspend trading again, and the situation became more severe than before. The Ministry specially dispatched Vice Minister Cheng to Shanghai to investigate and handle the matter. Du visited his residence to report the situation and discuss solutions. It lasted quite a while. It is now learned that Du is still acting as a third party to mediate, trying to get the buying and selling parties to eliminate prejudices, negotiate openly, and avoid a stalemate.</p>
<p>Final Decisive Action</p>
<p>The selling representatives requested Vice Minister Cheng to apply the provisions of Article 154, Section 8 of the Exchange's Business Rules, to settle the price according to a ten-day average. All parties unanimously opposed this. Therefore, the Vice Minister granted an extension of time to allow the buying side ample opportunity to consider. It was decided to reconvene the responsible brokers at 10:00 AM today to continue discussions and listen to opinions to seek a solution. It is reliably learned that the government authorities, in order to maintain the Exchange's business, if the two sides cannot understand and compromise, will invoke the provisions of Article 154, Section 3 of the Exchange's Business Rules, "having orders from the competent authority," to take decisive action when necessary.</p>
<p>Buying and Selling Sides Each Have Their Own Story</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports: After Vice Minister Cheng Tiangu of the Ministry of Industry arrived in Shanghai, in addition to summoning representatives from the Yarn and Cloth Exchange Brokers Association for talks, he consulted on handling methods the night before last. Chen Yu, a consultant from the Ministry of Industry, Section Chief Kuang Yunwen, Exchange Supervisor Wang Xiaolai, Local Association President Du Yuesheng, and Chairman of the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange Mu Ouchu attended. After a long period of consultation, it was decided to wait for the responses from the brokers' representatives before reviewing and handling the matter. Furthermore, it was learned from the Yarn and Cloth Exchange brokers yesterday morning that the selling side believes that the soaring prices of yarn and cotton are due to manipulation by powerful figures. Therefore, they hope to settle the transaction according to the provisions of Article 154, Section 8 of the Exchange's Business Rules, stating that when it is impossible to reduce the risks of brokers and other related parties without closing the transaction, the price can be settled by averaging the price over ten days. However, the buying side believes that the soaring yarn prices are actually a result of reduced yarn inventory and the trend of brisk sales, not manipulation by speculators.</p>
<h3>Meiya General Factory and Jingwei Factory Resume Work and Then Go on Strike Again</h3>
<p>Party and Government to Discuss Emergency Measures This Morning</p>
<p>The Meiya Jingwei Factory and the General Factory, in accordance with the approval of the Social Bureau, started operations at 6:00 AM yesterday. The Social Bureau sent Mu Guilin, and the Police Bureau sent a bureau officer and patrol officer to supervise everything at the factory. After earnestly persuading the workers, the workers entered the factory one after another. The General Factory had over a hundred people, and the Jingwei Factory had over three hundred people. However, after working until around 10:00 AM, after the representatives from the Social and Police Bureaus left the factory, the workers continued to strike, causing the machines to suddenly stop at 10:30 AM. The workers also did not leave the factory for lunch at noon and issued a declaration stating that they would go on a hunger strike. Upon hearing the news in the afternoon, the Police Bureau dispatched Yao, the chief of the Ximen Branch, to personally persuade them, but they still continued to strike as before until late at night. It is heard that the party and government authorities will convene this morning to discuss emergency measures to resolve the dispute as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Wenxi Paper Mill Actively Proceeding</h3>
<p>Purchasing 300 Mu of Land to Build Factory Buildings; Vice Minister of Industry Zhou Yi Chun to Come to Shanghai to Instruct on Everything</p>
<p>The Wenxi Paper Mill was established on the 1st of this month. After appointing the responsible personnel, the original office building on the fifth floor of the Shen Bao building was originally used provisionally. A new office was found at Room 404, 4th Floor, 160 Edward Road, Thames Building, and the company office has moved there and officially started operations. The factory in Wenxi, Yongjia, Zhejiang, is also actively proceeding. Preparations are being made to encircle and requisition 300 mu of land to purchase and build factory buildings. Meanwhile, manufacturing machines are being ordered from the United Kingdom, and negotiations are underway. The technical aspects will be handled by Deputy Manager Jin Han, who will also serve as the engineer. Jin previously studied papermaking technology in the United States.

<h3>The Farmers Bank of China Promotes Land Loans</h3>
<p>Focusing on Frontier Provinces Such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou; Establishing Farmers' Loan Offices to Enable All to Share the Benefits</p>
<p>The Farmers Bank of China is the authoritative agricultural bank in our country. In recent years, it has spared no effort in rescuing disaster areas with agricultural loans, promoting the organization of cooperative societies, and making progress. Since the head office moved from Hankou to Shanghai, General Manager Ye Zhuotang has been working at the bank daily. Regarding the bank's handling of land and rural loan matters in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Finance, it was learned yesterday that the bank has decided to focus its promotion area for the above-mentioned business on provinces such as Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, and Guizhou, to develop the frontier, complete the mission of lending funds to farmers, revitalizing the rural economy, promoting agricultural production, and improving progress. ㊀ The standard for farmers' land mortgage loans is one-quarter of the assessed value of the provincial land. The loan procedures are based on the principle of cooperatives relending to their members, with a maximum of twenty yuan per member. The purpose is limited to agricultural improvement, water conservancy for drought relief, construction of agricultural housing and warehouses, agricultural experiments, and other necessary items to promote agricultural production. ㊁ In addition to establishing farmers' loan offices in Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu, etc., all provinces that have not yet established such offices will universally establish them. This type of loan is not for profit, but to remove the shackles of farmers' economic hardship, so that farmers in various places who work hard can share the benefits. At the same time, negotiations are being held with the provincial governments to jointly operate agricultural warehouses, with the bank providing funds for the construction needs. At the same time, a large amount of funds are being prepared to open up storage and pledge services.</p>
<h3>The Supervisors and Committee Members of the Film Association to be Sworn in Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Film Production and Industry Association will hold a supplementary inauguration ceremony for the executive supervisors and committee members tomorrow at the association's premises in the Pudong Building, followed immediately by the first joint meeting of the executive supervisors and committee members. Among the issues listed on the agenda, the Cantonese sound film issue and the new theater issue are the most important. According to the association's spokesperson, regarding the ban on shooting Cantonese sound films, the members of the association have never made any requests to the central government in the past. The Film Censorship Committee's issuance of an order banning the shooting of dialect films was a measure taken automatically by the China Film Association based on promoting the unified national language policy. When the ban was first issued, although there was no association organization at the time, the companies had once gathered to discuss asking for the order to be withdrawn. Later, they recognized that unifying the national language was indeed an important policy for uniting all ethnic groups and resisting foreign aggression. Therefore, they unanimously obeyed the ban. In addition to stopping the shooting of Cantonese sound films in Shanghai, the filming locations set up in Hong Kong were closed one after another. In the past, due to environmental factors, this ban could not be implemented in South China, causing great losses to the law-abiding companies. Furthermore, because film producers in South China used their special status to compete in shooting Cantonese sound films, the mission of Mandarin films to assist the national language unification policy could not achieve its publicity effect in South China and Nanyang. They deeply felt that the losses suffered had no value. Later, with national unification, the reliance on defying government orders in South China has been completely eliminated. The Film Censorship Committee, with great magnanimity, did not investigate the past faults of the companies in South China. In addition to setting up remedial measures to preserve the established facts, the implementation of the ban was repeatedly extended. The member companies of this association, or those who suspect that the central government has no determination to implement the ban, inquired on the 9th of this month, believing that if the central government does not intend to implement the ban, the member companies of this association not only have the full ability to produce Cantonese films, but can also plan to produce other dialect films. Upon receiving approval, it was learned that the central government has set July of this year as the deadline for shooting Cantonese films. The film companies in South China were therefore panicked and launched a "Save the Cantonese Film Industry" conference, attempting to resist stubbornly. They also made unfounded accusations against the member companies of this association. It is now heard that representatives from South China have gone to Beijing to request the cancellation of the ban. This association, taking into account the future of the industry and the value of respecting the law and following policies, will gather tomorrow to discuss and issue a statement to the people of the country in order to seek a fair judgment. As for New Earth films, although they have now naturally stopped being shown, the value and responsibility of the Public Works Department's censorship of films must also be estimated and studied. When New Earth films were shown at the Donghe Theater on the second day, the Secretary-General of this association personally went to buy a ticket to watch. In front of and inside the theater, in addition to the protection of the Japanese naval landing force, there were Chinese and Western detectives across the street from the theater, clearly responsible for protection. From this, it can be seen that the Public Works Department did not strictly prohibit the showing of New Earth. Furthermore, the Japanese are promoting that this film is a product of German-Japanese cooperation, and they will also ask the German consul whether the country agrees to cooperate on this film in the position of the German state.</p>
<h3>Feng Yixian and Others Initiate the Construction of a Memorial Stele for Zhang Qun</h3>
<p>Zhang Made Contributions to Shanghai During His Tenure as Mayor</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government has decided to hold a tenth anniversary conference on July 7th in the city center, while simultaneously exhibiting agricultural, industrial, and commercial products and political and academic achievements to promote encouragement. It is heard that over a hundred people in the education sector, including Feng Yixian, believe that the realization of the Greater Shanghai Plan, today's great construction, and the scale of a modern city should be attributed to the grand strategy of former Mayor Zhang Qun. Out of gratitude, the citizens should express something. When former Mayor Zhang Qun was in office, he sought to reduce expenses in everything, alleviating the burden on our citizens. Recalling that when he left, there was still 800,000 silver dollars in the treasury. The government was thrifty, the people were safe, and he had a good relationship with the community. Therefore, it has been specially proposed to erect a memorial stele at the tenth anniversary to preserve the memory of his virtue. Currently, joint initiators are being sought from all sectors. It is estimated that individuals contribute one yuan and groups contribute two yuan, and the total amount should not exceed ten yuan, to comply with Zhang's original intention of thrift and frugality. Those who wish to participate may quickly send a letter to Mr. Feng at the Municipal Education Association on Dajilu Road. A formal meeting will be convened and prepared in the shortest possible time. The location of the stele will be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3>The National Rice Inspection Team from Five Provinces and Cities to Gather in Shanghai and Depart Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Gu Xinyi Banquets Anhui Representatives; Zheng Baozhao Will Be Recommended as the Head of the Team</p>
<p>The National Rice Transport and Sales Inspection Team organized by grain merchants from five provinces and cities including Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei has been prepared and decided to gather in Shanghai tomorrow and depart by ship. Sun and Xu, two representatives of Anhui grain merchants, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. Gu Xinyi, chairman of the Shanghai Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, held a banquet last night to welcome them and discuss the establishment of a national rice transportation and sales company in five provinces and cities. Currently, representatives of grain merchants from Jiangsu and Hunan have decided to gather in Shanghai today. It is heard that the head of the team has been determined to be Zheng Baozhao, director of the Grain Transport and Sales Bureau. The purpose of the inspection is: ㊀ What types of rice and grain are most suitable for consumption in South China; ㊁ How to stabilize prices so that they meet the needs of both production and consumption; ㊂ What kind of organization of the market is reasonable to reduce costs, facilitate transportation and sales, connect feelings, eliminate gaps, and ensure that national rice is completely unimpeded in the country. The inspection locations are Fujian, Xiamen, Chaozhou, Shantou, Guangzhou, and other places. They will first go to Guangdong and then to other places for thorough inspection. The trip will take about a month. If time permits, they may go to Annam and Saigon to inspect the rice-producing areas. Gu Xinyi was previously nominated by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to participate as a representative, but now that Gu is busy with affairs, he has asked to withdraw and will nominate someone else to join.</p>
<h3>National Assembly Canadian Representative</h3>
<p>Huang Yuanwei Selected</p>
<p>According to local overseas Chinese organizations, a telegram received from Canada on the 12th of this month stated that the representatives to the National Assembly have now been elected according to law. It is heard that the elected person is Huang Yuanwei, a prominent figure in the overseas Chinese community, from Taishan County, Guangdong Province. He has served as the chairman of the Montreal Chinese Association, a member of the Overseas Chinese Anti-Japanese Relief Bureau, the principal of the Montreal School, a standing committee member of the Kuomintang Eastern Canada Joint Committee, a standing committee member of the Montreal Branch, the chairman of the 11th Kuomintang Eastern Canada Representative Congress, and a representative to all previous All-Canada Representative Congresses. He is also a member of the Overseas Chinese Donation Committee and has been awarded medals for his contributions to the Party and the country.</p>
<h3>Chinese Buddhist Association Rectifies Alms-Seeking Methods</h3>
<p>Striking Wooden Fish and Gongs Does Not Violate Current Systems</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association received a report from the Hankou City Branch regarding the reorganization of monastic alms-seeking methods. The association considered the matter feasible and, in addition to instructing all temples across the country to comply, specially replied to the branch yesterday: "The report and the outlines have been received and examined. The various methods prescribed are feasible and should be put on file. However, the reference to striking wooden fish, gongs, chanting, and barefootedness in Article 6 of the rules does not violate the current monastic system and should not be restricted. As for the fact that the supervisors, councilors, and alternate supervisors and councilors can all report to the police, which may lead to abuses, it should be decided by the council. It is hereby revised."</p>

<h3>The Public Works Department Again Bans the Screening of Humiliating Chinese Films at the Donghe Theater</h3>
<p>Defense Line 8,000 Kilometers Long; Even More So Than New Earth</p>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily reported that after the film "New Earth" was banned from screening by the Public Works Department, unexpectedly, the national policy film "Defense Line 8,000 Kilometers Long", which was about to be screened at the Donghe Theater, had problems after being screened for relevant authorities on the 12th. At 10:00 a.m. on the 12th, the police station of the Japanese Consulate General received a notice from the Public Works Department's Film Review Committee, banning the screening. (Reporter's note: This film completely depicts how the Manchukuo puppet organization developed and constructed, humiliating our country everywhere, exaggerating Japan's military might in Manchuria, and is even worse than "New Earth". The Public Works Department, in order to avoid stimulating the bad feelings of our citizens, justly banned the screening.)</p>
<h3>Narcotics Seized from Two Koreans</h3>
<p>Totaling More Than Thirty Ounces; Arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai-Pingcheng Train</p>
<p>At around 7:40 a.m. yesterday, when the Shanghai-Pingcheng train arrived at the North Railway Station, two Koreans, Wen Zanlin, 38 years old, and Liang Guijun, 29 years old, were each carrying a suitcase. During a travel inspection by Jianghai Customs investigators stationed at the station, two large packages of heroin were found in the specially made waistbands (shaped like small vests) worn by the two Koreans, totaling more than thirty ounces. The two Koreans were taken to the Railway Police Station by Lun Wen and transferred to the North Station Branch for detention. Liang Fuchu, the chief of the branch, notified the Japanese Consulate to send Japanese personnel to the scene to take them back for interrogation and punishment. The more than twenty ounces of heroin were confiscated by customs.</p>
<h3>76-Year-Old Overseas Chinese Has No Home to Return To</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau Helps Find Nursing Home</p>
<p>Yang Xishan, an elderly overseas Chinese from the United Kingdom, 76 years old, returned to the country alone on the 8th of this month because he did not forget his motherland, after being in the United States for more than 30 years. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, it was learned from the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau that after the elderly overseas Chinese arrived in Shanghai, he had no relatives to rely on in his hometown of Tianjin, and they did not recognize each other. He had the feeling of "leaving home young and returning old." Furthermore, the overseas Chinese had no home to return to, so he was still staying at the Juegong Shun Inn in Shiliupu. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau sympathized with his situation and has been trying to find a charitable organization with nursing home facilities to send him to for care for the rest of his life.</p>
<h3>High Tide on the Huangpu River During the Dragon Boat Festival</h3>
<p>Reaching Nearly Eleven Feet; Low Roads Were Flooded</p>
<p>The tide on the Huangpu River was quite high yesterday morning. According to records from the Dredging Bureau, the high tide occurred at 3:10 a.m. yesterday, reaching nearly eleven feet. This was due to the low atmospheric pressure, which exceeded expectations. It began to recede at 6:00 a.m. and returned to normal by noon. Furthermore, during the high tide, gutters in front of the China General Merchandise Company on Sichuan Road, the Jincheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, and other places were seen to be overflowing with water.</p>
<h3>Robbers Open Fire to Resist Arrest on Tiantong'an Road</h3>
<p>Five People, Including Men and Women, Captured; One Handgun and Eight Bullets Seized</p>
<p>Miao Yizhi, a detective officer from the 7th Brigade of the Municipal Central District Detective General Team, received a tip at around 5:00 PM on the 11th of this month that seven or eight robbers had come to Shanghai from Jintan County after looting and were hiding in a certain place. After receiving the report, the detective officer immediately reported to Squad Leader Cao Jinda, and squad leader Min Hensheng, who in turn reported to the General Team Leader Liu Huai, who sent Tao Jinsheng to assist the entire 7th Brigade in the investigation. After capturing two robbers, Xiao Qiu and Xu Hongfei, at the North Railway Station, they confessed that they had robbed a pig shop outside the east gate of Jintan County and brought a large number of items in suitcases. They also revealed that there were many accomplices with two handguns, but they did not know their addresses, but they often passed through Tiantong'an Road. After receiving the confession, the detective officers waited at that location for two days without success. At around 1:00 AM yesterday, Detective Miao and Tao Jinsheng, who were sent by the General Team, along with police officer Zhou Zhongying from the local police station, encountered six robbers in front of a barber shop at 641 Tiantong'an Road. The detective officers stepped forward to investigate. At that time, two robbers knew that the situation was not good and opened fire to resist arrest. The police officers returned fire. As a result, one robber, Zhang Yongqing, was captured. A handgun, number 400062, containing eight bullets, was seized. Fortunately, it was late at night and there were no pedestrians on the road, so no one was injured. After the robber was taken into custody, he confessed that his accomplices lived at 22 Tongji Road at the intersection of Hengfeng Road. The team then joined forces with the Hengfeng Road Police Station and sent officers to Tongji Road to arrest Wei San and Wei Chenshi, as well as seizing stolen ocean of one hundred and twenty yuan, which was confessed to have been looted from the Zhoujiaqiao Ancestral Hall in December of last year. Currently, a total of five robbers, including men and women, along with a handgun, eight bullets, and stolen goods, were sent to the Detective General Team for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Method of Compiling Income Tax Returns (32)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao, Ming Shan</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Since its publication, the method of compiling income tax returns has been well-received by readers. However, due to space limitations, it has sometimes been difficult to publish even after strenuous efforts to reduce other submissions. As a result, readers have often been dissatisfied, frequently inquiring and urging us to complete the publication as soon as possible. Looking back to its initial publication four months ago, it is clearly no longer appropriate to delay further. However, publishing it in installments within the commercial news section would mean it is not known when we could fully complete it. Therefore, we have no choice but to use the space in this issue's special economic publication to publish all remaining articles. Another article, "Key Points of Revised Guidelines for Various Types of Income Tax Collection," will still have to wait for continued publication tomorrow. However, as there is also a large backlog of submissions for the special economic publication, and today's issue is again occupied by income tax matters, the editor expresses sincere apologies to all contributors of the special publication.</p>
<p>㊉㊂ First Category, Item One: Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Tax for Temporary Profit-Making Businesses Where Income Cannot be Calculated Based on Capital</p>
<p>Income tax for profit-making businesses is divided into three categories: A, B, and C. Item one refers to income tax from temporary profit-making businesses. These types of temporary profit-making businesses either have established capital or no capital at all. For those with capital, tax is levied on the percentage of actual net profit to the actual capital amount. When filing, the report forms for self-assessment of income tax for profit-making businesses under categories A and B are used. Those without capital use this form for filing.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of Article 12 of the Implementing Rules, income from buying and selling goods, securities, or gold and silver currency unrelated to the primary business is considered temporary profit. The same applies to non-business individuals who engage in the aforementioned buying and selling but do not settle with physical delivery on the agreed date. This article applies regardless of whether there is capital or not. As for whether temporary business income should be self-assessed or withheld, there are explicit provisions in Article 27 of the Implementing Rules. It states, "For those belonging to Item C of the first category, if there is a paying organization, the person in charge of the organization shall withhold the tax on behalf of the taxpayer. If there is no paying organization, the taxpayer or their agent shall pay it themselves." According to this provision, temporary profit-making income, such as that from trading in stock exchanges or markets, should be withheld by the broker who is the paying organization. Only when there is no paying organization, such as in ordinary market transactions, can the taxpayer (or their agent) pay it themselves. However, Article 12 of the Implementing Rules explicitly stipulates that income not calculated under the revenue item of the primary business is considered temporary profit-making business. Therefore, for any temporary profit-making income, as long as it is included under the revenue item of the primary business, there is no need for a separate income tax return. Even if the source of income involves a paying organization such as an exchange broker, the taxpayer can refuse the broker's withholding of income tax. However, the term "primary business" in Article 12 of the Implementing Rules should refer to profit-making businesses under categories A and B. Furthermore, it should refer to the fact that profit-making businesses under categories A and B must calculate the total income from their profit-making business, calculate the tax amount, and pay income tax to the local competent collection agency. If the taxpayer does not have this qualification, the paying organization should withhold income tax on their behalf. The report for such withholding is a separate Report Form for Withholding Income Tax on Income from Buying and Selling Securities, Goods, Gold, and Silver Currency, which is not within the scope of this form.</p>
<p>If a profit-making business has branches, and its head office is outside the Republic of China while its branches are within the country, or if the branches are outside the country while the head office is within the country, according to the provisions of Article 5 of the Implementing Rules, regardless of whether the capital is divided or not, profits generated from domestic business operations must be taxed as temporary profit-making business income and taxed at the tax rates specified in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. The tax rates in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations are for those whose income cannot be calculated based on capital, and naturally apply to the format of this form. However, according to the provisions of Article 1 of the Collection Guidelines for this category, the aforementioned situation of branches being outside the country while the head office is within the country refers to cases where the entire business location of the branches is outside the country. If only part of the branch is outside the country, the profit-making income of the domestic part can still be calculated based on capital. Only the profits from business operations in the foreign part need to be excluded from the net profit of the head office. It is common for domestic profit-making businesses to have some branches operating abroad. Taxing them entirely according to the provisions of Article 5 of the Implementing Rules would result in an unbearable tax burden. The Collection Guidelines supplement this by allowing them to still calculate income tax according to profit-making businesses under categories A and B, which is very appropriate. As for excluding the foreign profits from the head office's net profit, this is also naturally in accordance with the principle of territorial taxation. However, with such a division, the branches in the foreign part must divide or estimate their capital to be deducted from the capital of the domestic head office." The method of compiling this form is explained as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Type of Business, Taxpayer's Name, Address: The taxpayer is the tax obligor, i.e., the filer of this form. The name, address, and type of business should be clearly stated in this form. The purpose of this form is often for temporary profits in ordinary markets, such as when a non-business individual buys or sells goods, securities, or gold and silver currency outside of stock exchanges or markets. Such profits may also be made by several partners. However, partnerships with established capital must use the Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Tax for Profit-Making Businesses under Categories A and B for filing, which is unrelated to this form.</p>
<p>㊁ Settlement Date, Reporting Date: The settlement date is the date on which the income from the temporary profit-making business is calculated. The reporting date is the date on which this form is filed. Both should be clearly stated in this form. According to the provisions of Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations, income tax for Item C of the first category, whether withheld or self-assessed, should be reported within one month after the settlement date. According to the provisions of Article 26 of the Implementing Rules, this type of income tax should be paid within twenty days from the settlement reporting date. The term "settlement" used in the articles refers to calculating the income amount in the accounting books. Whether this income has been actually received or not is not a concern of the tax law.</p>
<p>㊂ Total Revenue, Business Expenses: Total revenue is the total revenue actually received and receivable from business operations. Business expenses refer to necessary and reasonable expenses already paid and payable but unpaid in business operations, excluding bad debts, depreciation, and inventory consumption, as well as other donations and fees. This type of revenue and expenditure forms the basis for calculating the net profit amount, and should be clearly stated in this form. Revenue should include all profits from the current business operation. Expenses are subject to certain restrictions according to the provisions of Article 15 of the Implementing Rules and Article 14 of the Collection Guidelines for this category. In terms of legal intention, a detailed statement of revenue and expenses should be attached. Assets and liabilities should also be listed in a table for reporting. The provisions of Article 24 of the Implementing Rules are quite clear in meaning, but the format of this form does not have such provisions.</p>
<p>㊃ Net Profit Amount, Tax Payable: The net profit amount is the total revenue minus business expenses, which is the income amount. Based on this net profit amount, multiply it by the tax rate stipulated in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations to obtain the income tax payable, which should be clearly stated in this form. Article 7 of the Provisional Regulations states that income from the first category should be taxed based on net profit calculation, and the net profit amount recorded in this form is of this nature. According to the provisions of Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations, the tax rate for income from Item C of the first category that cannot be calculated based on capital amount is a progressive tax rate on the full amount. It starts from 30 per mille for income of 100 yuan or more but less than 1,000 yuan, and progresses to 200 per mille for income of 18,000 yuan or more. Compared to the tax rate for income tax under categories A and B, which has a maximum of 100 per mille, the tax rate is heavier, but income less than 100 yuan is not taxed.</p>
<p>The above is the method of compiling this form. After this form is completed, the taxpayer, i.e., the filer of this form, should sign and affix their seal, and file it with the local competent collection agency.</p>
<p>㊉㊃ Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Tax for Profit-Making Businesses Under Categories A and B Due to Merger, Dissolution, Closure, or Transfer</p>
<p>Article 22 of the Implementing Rules stipulates, "For profit-making businesses under categories A and B of the first category, if there is still income after merger, dissolution, closure, liquidation, or settlement, the income amount should be reported. If there is still income after bankruptcy is declared and liquidation is carried out, the bankruptcy trustee should report the income amount." Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines for this category states, "...due to merger, dissolution, closure, transfer, after liquidation or settlement...". This form is the report form used to report the income amount from this liquidation or settlement. The settlement of income amount for profit-making businesses under categories A and B of the first category is based on the net profit amount. The net profit amount is naturally the same as the difference between the total assets amount and the total capital and liabilities amount. However, there is a difference between the ongoing and liquidation settlement of various assets and liabilities. An ongoing settlement is based on use value, while a liquidation settlement is based on sales value. The same asset will naturally have different valuations depending on whether it is valued based on sales value or use value. The same liability will also have valuation differences depending on whether it is calculated based on a continuing nature or a settled nature. Usual settlements of items A, B, and C are ongoing settlements, while settlements at the time of merger, dissolution, closure, transfer, etc., are sales settlements. The net profit amount resulting from the latter will naturally differ from the former. Therefore, the nature of the income amount reported in this form differs from that calculated in the Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Tax for Profit-Making Businesses under Categories A and B. Suppose a certain business has reported its income at the end of the year according to the method of usual settlement. If it is also necessary to close the business by means of merger, dissolution, closure, or transfer, the assets and liabilities should be separately calculated to determine the remaining amount of property, which should be compared with the original property amount. The income tax should then be deducted from the excess amount. The purpose of this type of income tax seems to be to crack down on those who conceal their profits during usual settlements. Those who deliberately suppress the valuation of their assets or hide their revenue during usual settlements will have their true situation exposed during mergers, dissolutions, closures, and transfers, as they are required to settle based on sales value. It is only natural to calculate the excess over the original settlement amount based on the true situation and levy income tax. However, according to this meaning, it is only appropriate to levy tax on the profits that have not been taxed. The following can be listed as profits that have not been taxed:</p>
<p>㊀ Appreciation of Assets: Assets should be depreciated, bad debts should be written off, and intangible assets should be amortized during usual settlements, so the recorded amount on the balance sheet is often reduced below the actual amount. This reduction is legal as long as it does not conflict with the asset valuation method attached to the Collection Guidelines for this category. The competent collection agency naturally has no way to tax the profits hidden by the legal price reduction during usual times. However, assets should be revalued during liquidation or settlement. The first item of the asset valuation method stipulates that "at the time of merger, dissolution, closure, transfer, and liquidation, the market price shall be the standard for valuation," which means this. Therefore, for those whose actual asset amount is less than the book value, the value should be increased. Excessive provisions for bad debt reserves and depreciation reserves should be included in earnings. Items such as brand name and trademark rights that can be sold at a price higher than the book value should also be treated as profit. As for assets not on the books that can be sold for a price, they should be included in profit.</p>
<p>㊁ Deduction of Liabilities: Liabilities are valued at the full amount according to the book value during usual settlements. If part of the liabilities can be deducted during liquidation or settlement, it should be transferred to profit. For example, issuing bonds at a reduced price or receiving discounts on purchase accounts.</p>
<p>㊂ Revenue Receivable: If the calculation of profit and loss is based on actual receipts during usual times, the revenue receivable that has not been entered into the accounts must be estimated during liquidation or settlement.</p>
<p>㊃ Recovery of Donations and Fees: If the calculation of profit and loss is based on actual payments during usual times, the donations and fees already paid that can be recovered should be transferred to profit during liquidation or settlement. If the accrual system is adopted, any portion that can be written off should be written off.</p>
<p>㊄ Legal Reserve Fund: According to the provisions of Article 15 of the Implementing Rules, the income tax of limited companies and limited partnership companies can be calculated after deducting the legal reserve fund from the net profit amount. This legal reserve fund is the untaxed portion of retained income.</p>
<p>The five types mentioned above are untaxed profits. There is no need to calculate the tax payable on them during usual times. They should be calculated during liquidation or settlement. However, it should be noted that the valuation of assets can be higher or lower than the book value. Liabilities can be reduced, or new ones can arise. Other profit and loss items include revenue receivable and revenue to be returned. Donations and fees include those to be recovered and those to be supplemented. The entire account, whether it is profit or loss, must be summarized and reconciled to determine whether the property value during liquidation or settlement is higher or lower than during the usual settlement. If it is higher, the excess over the original property amount should be taxed, and the previously accrued legal reserve fund should be separately taxed. If it is lower, the accumulated legal reserve fund should first be used to cover the losses, and then the remaining amount should bear the income tax.</p>
<p>The reason why liquidation or settlement is required at market prices during mergers, dissolutions, closures, and transfers should be further explained. The original business of those who dissolve, close, or transfer their businesses through liquidation or settlement is terminated, and all property should be distributed immediately. It is only natural to settle at market prices after the termination of the business. As for mergers, according to popular understanding, the original business seems to exist in the business after the merger. However, from a legal point of view, the business organized after the merger is newly established, and the one being merged should be eliminated. Since the business is eliminated, it should also be settled at market prices, which are the settlement value.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of income tax, partnerships have been reorganized into companies one after another. Reorganization is legally the elimination of the old organization and the emergence of the new organization. If the price at the time of elimination of the old organization is higher than the closing price as of December 31, 1936, this form should also be reported, and income tax should be paid. As for the taxation of income from future mergers, dissolutions, closures, and transfers, the legal reserve fund portion should be limited to those generated after January 1, 1937.</p>
<p>The method of compiling this form is explained below:</p>
<p>㊀ Taxpayer's Name, Address, Type of Business: The taxpayer is the tax obligor, and their name, address, and type of business should be recorded in this form. In the format of this form, the words "(or Liquidator/Trustee)" are noted in parentheses next to the taxpayer's name, which is used by the designated liquidator or trustee handling merger, dissolution, closure, transfer, and other matters. The Company Law and Bankruptcy Law have provisions for the name of the liquidator. As for the trustee, this provision only exists in the previously abolished Provisional Regulations on Debt Repayment for Merchants. In terms of the jurisprudence of current laws, it seems more appropriate to call them liquidators. Any business owner, shop, firm, factory, etc., can serve as a liquidator. Persons other than the business owner can also serve as liquidators through the election of shareholders or the appointment of the court. When a person other than the business owner serves as the liquidator, the type of business recorded in this form should be the type of business of the profit-making enterprise being liquidated.</p>
<p>㊁ Settlement Date, Reporting Date: The settlement date is the settlement date of the income reported in this form, and the reporting date is the filing date of this form. Both should be clearly stated in the form. According to the provisions of Article 22 of the Implementing Rules, the income reported in this form should be reported to the local competent collection agency within twenty days from the settlement date. According to the provisions of Article 26 of the same Implementing Rules, the tax payment should be made within twenty days from the reporting date. The income tax reported in this form is a settlement income tax, which must wait until all accounts have been settled before this form can be compiled.</p>
<p>㊂ Original Capital Amount, Remaining Property Amount: Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines for this category stipulates the following for the remaining property amount after liquidation or settlement: "Except for those on which income tax has been levied, the portion exceeding the original actual capital amount shall be taxed on the excess portion." This actual capital amount and remaining property amount should be recorded in this form. According to the format of this form, it is the original capital amount rather than the actual capital amount. To comply with laws and regulations, it is of course advisable to change it to the actual capital amount. However, the income from liquidation or settlement must always be the difference between the property after liquidation or settlement and the property settled during the usual settlement before liquidation or settlement, plus the tax-free government bonds, which is the income amount. According to the provisions of Article 7 of the Implementing Rules and Article 6 of the Collection Guidelines for this category, the so-called actual capital amount is the paid-up capital plus one-third of various reserve funds and retained earnings. Compared with the above provision, the nature of the property settled during usual settlements seems to be different. Whether Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines should be revised seems to be worth considering.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, the so-called "remaining property, except for those on which income tax has been levied, exceeding the original actual capital amount..." means that the remaining property should exclude the optional reserve fund and retained earnings on which income tax has been levied, and then compare it with the original actual capital amount. The remaining property after liquidation or settlement is the net asset excluding the optional reserve fund and retained earnings. If the original capital amount position in the form only records the actually paid-up or actually invested principal without including the reserve funds, etc., the portion by which the former exceeds the latter is the same as the total property after liquidation or settlement exceeding the total property settled during the usual settlement before liquidation or settlement, plus the untaxed legal reserve fund. Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines only needs to be explained in addition to what is called "original actual capital amount". Therefore, the original capital amount specified in the format of this form seems to be better than the original actual capital amount specified in the Guidelines.</p>
<p>㊃ Tax Payable on the Portion of the Remaining Property Amount Exceeding the Original Capital Amount: The portion of the remaining property amount exceeding the original capital amount, after deducting those on which income tax has been levied, is the income after liquidation or settlement. According to the provisions of Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines for this category, it should be taxed according to the tax rates in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. This tax rate is for those whose income from temporary profit-making businesses cannot be calculated based on capital amount. It starts from a minimum of 30 per mille and progresses to 200 per mille. Income less than 100 yuan is not taxed.</p>
<p>The so-called "deducting those on which income tax has been levied" naturally includes the optional reserve fund and retained earnings. The various actual reserves (i.e., reserves not intended to cover asset deficits) accrued during the usual distribution of profits should also belong to this category.</p>
<p>The above is a detailed description of the method of compiling this form. After this form is completed, the date should be recorded, and the responsible person of the report should sign and affix their seal, together with the liquidation report and settlement calculation report. They should be submitted to the local competent collection agency. The responsible person of the report is the liquidator during liquidation, the trustee during settlement, and the bankruptcy administrator during bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The liquidation calculation report or settlement calculation report is a detailed statement that must be separately prepared when reporting income from liquidation or settlement. This is explicitly stipulated in Article 23 of the Collection Guidelines for this category. The attachment of this type of detailed statement is naturally intended to indicate in detail the disposal of property and the source of income. Therefore, the gain or loss from the sale of assets and repayment of debts compared to the usual settlement before liquidation or settlement, as well as the organization of profit and loss accounts and the existence or surplus of the legal reserve fund, should all be indicated in this type of calculation report. The calculation method stipulated in Article 18 of the Collection Guidelines for this category, i.e., the portion of the remaining property amount exceeding the original capital amount excluding those on which income tax has been levied, should also be calculated in this type of calculation report.</p>
<p>㊉㊄ Report Form for Withholding Income Tax on Income from Buying and Selling Securities, Goods, Gold, and Silver Currency</p>
<p>Income from buying and selling securities, goods, gold, and silver currency is not within the scope of the primary business and is not included under the revenue item of the primary business. If a non-business individual earns income from this type of buying and selling, it is called temporary profit-making income. According to the provisions of Articles 12 and 27 of the Implementing Rules, if there is a paying organization, the person in charge of the organization should withhold income tax on behalf of the taxpayer. This form is used to report this type of income tax. Those who entrust a broker to trade on the stock exchange or market and do not have the taxpayer qualifications for profit-making businesses under categories A and B are most suited to the format of this form. This form is a report form and has an attached list to detail the income situation of each taxpayer. The amount recorded in the report form is based on the list. Therefore, when compiling the report form, the list should be compiled first. The method of compiling the list will now be explained first.</p>
<p>The income tax reported in the report form is a withholding tax. According to the provisions of Article 28 of the Implementing Rules, those withholding income tax should issue the income amount of each taxpayer. The purpose of the list is to comply with this article. The main items recorded in the list are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Withholding Agent: The withholding agent is the person withholding income tax. For brokers in the exchange, their account name should be recorded on the list. When settling transactions entrusted to them by clients, brokers should calculate the income tax based on the settlement income, withhold it on their behalf, and report and pay it in aggregate. However, clients who meet the provisions of Article 12 of the Implementing Rules to include it under the revenue item of the primary business can include the income from temporary profit-making under the revenue item of the primary business and wait until the end of each year to calculate the total income from profit-making businesses under categories A and B of this category and the income tax payable. Since there is no need for a separate settlement of profit and loss for each temporary profit-making transaction, there is no need for the broker to withhold income tax on their behalf. As for the broker themselves, who are originally profit-making businesses under categories A and B of this category, their income is not temporary profit or income. They should report their income amount and tax payable according to the format and compilation method of Form A of this category, i.e., the Report Form for Self-Assessment of Income Amount for Profit-Making Businesses under Categories A and B, which is not within the scope of this report form and list.</p>
<p>㊁ Date: The date should be recorded in the list. According to the provisions of Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations, the withheld income tax for temporary profits should be reported within one month after the settlement. In the report form, there is only a settlement date but no reporting date. The list does not have a position for the settlement date for each taxpayer's income. Therefore, the notes at the bottom of the list also explain that this list must be filled out once a day, as temporary profits in the exchange are due to daily settled transactions.</p>
<p>㊂ Taxpayer: The taxpayer is the tax obligor, i.e., the income earner who bears the income tax. Their account name should be recorded on the list, which is the broker's entrusted client. According to the provisions of Article 2 on tax exemption in the Provisional Regulations, the income of legal entities in the first category that are not for profit-making purposes is exempt from income tax. However, according to the provisions of Article 13 of the Implementing Rules, non-profit legal entities or organizations that also operate for profit-making purposes are regarded as profit-making businesses. Therefore, anyone who entrusts a broker to buy or sell securities, goods, gold, or silver currency and earns income, regardless of whether they are a legal entity not for profit-making purposes, is a taxpayer.</p>
<p>㊃ Type of Business, Type of Income: The type of business refers to securities, goods, gold, silver currency, etc. The income amount is the profit from that business income. They should be separately noted in the list for each taxpayer. The income amount is the amount of profit earned from each temporary profit-making transaction. According to the provisions of Article 19 of the Implementing Rules, the income amount should be calculated at the settlement of each transaction. The income amount recorded in the list should be listed separately for each transaction.</p>
<p>㊄ Commission, Net Profit Amount, Withheld Income Tax Amount: According to the provisions of Article 7 of the Provisional Regulations, the income of profit-making businesses in the first category should be taxed based on the net profit amount. The broker's commission is a necessary expense for this business income, and the income amount minus the commission is the net profit amount. Based on this net profit amount, multiply it by the tax rate stipulated in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations to obtain the income tax amount to be withheld. The commission, net profit amount, and withheld income tax amount should all be noted in the list. If the net profit is less than 100 yuan, there is no need to pay tax according to the law. For those exceeding 100 yuan, the tax rate starts from 30 per mille and progresses to 200 per mille.</p>
<p>The above is the method of compiling the list. The income amount, commission amount, net profit amount, and withheld income tax amount in the list should each be totaled and recorded in the report form. What is recorded in the report form is based on the list. In addition to recording this type of amount based on the list, the report form must record the withholding agent's name, address, type of business, and settlement date. The date of tax payment, the name of the receiving agency, and the receipt number should also be recorded one by one. The responsible person should sign, affix their seal, and report it to the local competent collection agency. According to the provisions of Article 26 of the Implementing Rules, this income tax must be paid at the time of settlement and reporting.</p>
<p>The Report Form for Withholding Income Tax on Income from Buying and Selling Securities, Goods, Gold, and Silver Currency, and its attached withholding list, as described above, are all based on current laws and regulations and the formats issued by the Ministry. However, in Shanghai, after negotiations between the brokers' associations of various exchanges and the person in charge of the local competent collection agency, three key points have been newly decided: ㊀ For clients who include the income from this type of profit-making under the revenue item of the primary business and are not required by law to have the broker withhold income tax on their behalf, the broker is still responsible for reporting their income amount for comparison. ㊁ Clients who meet the qualifications in the previous item are limited to those with capital of 2,000 yuan or more and who have reported income tax for profit-making businesses. ㊂ The phrase "calculating the income amount at the settlement of each transaction" in the Implementing Rules refers to the profit and loss at the settlement of each transaction. However, it is also permissible to reconcile the profit and loss of multiple transactions to calculate income tax. This reconciliation must be settled at least once every three months.</p>
<p>Those who establish their own brands and accept clients' entrustments attached to the location of the exchange broker and then entrust brokers to trade on the exchange market using their own brand names as the account name are commonly referred to as small companies. The nature of a small company is no different from a broker without a broker's license, and they have no place on the exchange. However, in fact, they also have a considerable functional existence. It remains to be determined how to report and withhold temporary profit-making income for entrusted clients. From the perspective of the Exchange Law, small companies can only be regarded as introducers. The original entrusted clients should be accounted for in the broker's account, and the broker should report their income amount or withhold their income tax. From the perspective of the established habit, small companies can report or withhold the income amount and income tax of their clients themselves. The small companies themselves are also income tax taxpayers for profit-making businesses under categories A and B of the first category. It is hoped that the local competent micro-collection agency will indicate its attitude. (End of complete text)</p>
<h3>Agreed Cooperative Epidemic Prevention Measures by the Municipal Government and Concession Authorities</h3>
<p>Increased Number of Vaccinations This Year</p>
<p>In order to prevent a cholera epidemic, the Municipal Government and the two Concession authorities have now decided on practical cooperative measures. It is reported that the Central Health Administration and the Public Concession authorities have prepared a large number of cholera vaccines, and the French Concession Board of Directors has also prepared 50,000 vaccines. Last year, the number of people vaccinated in the urban area was 461,354, in the Public Concession 224,036, in the French Concession 121,440, and at the Railway Health Office 15,320. The three authorities have decided to jointly launch a major publicity campaign this year, and the number of vaccinations is expected to increase. At the same time, various hospitals have also agreed to assist. Currently, the Municipal Hospital has prepared 180 cholera beds, the Public Concession 320, the French Concession 80, and the Yu Qiaqing Road Chinese Epidemic Hospital 6, etc. It is reported that the three authorities have now decided on a publicity strategy, asking citizens to pay attention to the following three points: ㊀ Be cautious about diet, do not eat raw or cold food; ㊁ Get vaccinated at various locations immediately; ㊂ If cholera symptoms are discovered, immediately send the patient to the hospital, and do not delay.</p>
<h3>Repeated Incidents of Negligence in Vacant Houses in Yangjing Town, Pudong</h3>
<p>Another Fire Reported Yesterday Morning - An Unidentified Female Corpse Once Discovered</p>
<p>In the Dongzhakou area of Yangjing Town, Pudong, more than 40 thatched sheds were built during the 12th year of the Republic of China (1923). Due to years of disrepair, most of the facades are incomplete. Currently, there are more than ten families of Jiangbei origin living there, with the remaining houses vacant. In February of this year, a fire occurred in a vacant house, but fortunately it did not cause a disaster. Last month, an unidentified female corpse was discovered in a vacant house, and strange events have been occurring one after another. Yesterday morning, at around 1:00 AM, a fire broke out again in the vacant house numbered 832. Even during the intermittent rainy season, the roof surface was completely wet, yet fire broke through the roof. The fire was quite intense, and the patrol police sounded the alarm. Soon, the town's fire brigade arrived and extinguished the fire, only burning down one and a half thatched sheds, avoiding a major disaster. Chief Cai of the police station in charge has ordered a summons to the house owner, Zhang, for questioning, to clarify the reason for the repeated fires in the vacant house.</p>
<h3>Strong Suspicion of Mother and Son for Killing and Hanging the Body on the Bed</h3>
<p>Awaiting the Summoning of the Li Liao Mother and Son to Court for Interrogation and Investigation</p>
<p>Shen Zhang, the wife of Shen Liezhong, at No. 114 Xicun, Zhoujiadu, Pudong, was found hanging in front of the bed in the early morning a few days ago, with her head split open and blood all over the floor. This was reported previously. The day before yesterday, the deceased's husband, Shen Liezhong, submitted a petition to the local court, stating that his original surname was Cheng, 26 years old, from Nantong, and a technician at the Huafeng Enamel Factory. The deceased, Shen Zhang, was his wife, 24 years old, and her former husband had passed away. On the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar this spring, he was introduced by his aunt, Xue Shen, to marry into the family as a second husband. On the twenty-first of the same month, she received 77 yuan from a hui (mutual aid society) and 7 yuan in wages, totaling 84 yuan, all hidden in her waistband pocket. At that time, only Li Liao (also known as Mi Bo's mother), who lived together with them, knew about it. Suddenly, on the first morning of the fifth lunar month, she was brutally murdered, suffering knife wounds to her head and other places. All the hui money was also lost. Li Liao has an older son who works in a woolen mill, but he did not go to work that day. The Tangqiao police station in charge suspects Li Liao and her son and has arrested them one after another. He stated that he had only been married for half a month, and their love was strong, but the couple was suddenly separated, causing him deep pain. He requested justice, etc. The court appointed Prosecutor He Jingcen, accompanied by Coroner Shen, to the scene. The examination revealed that the deceased had indeed been murdered before being hanged in front of the bed to make it look like a suicide. The coroner filled out the death certificate and ordered the family to collect the body. In addition to the on-site investigation, the prosecutor also summoned the deceased's aunt, Xue Shen, and uncle, Zhang Shaoxiang, for questioning. They are waiting for the police局 to bring Li Liao and her son to court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Inside Story of Yarn Factory Foremen - Starting with Hiring, Then Selling Off Female Workers</h3>
<p>Four Girls Boarded the Xiangyang Steamer to Anhui - Discovered by Investigators from the Relief Association</p>
<p>Many yarn factories have been opened in the Yangshupu area of the Public Concession, so there is also a large demand for female workers. Unexpectedly, there are some foremen or workers in the factory who have some influence and often go to Jiangbei to recruit girls from poor families, mostly around the age of seven or eight, bring them to Shanghai, and provide them with food, clothing, and accommodation. When they reach the age of twelve or thirteen, they rely on their influence to recommend them to work in yarn factories, and the wages they earn are also collected by these people. Some families even raise dozens of girls, with bunk beds set up in the house to accommodate them. When the foster daughters grow older, they arbitrarily force them to marry, so they can collect a sum of betrothal money, so they all profit greatly. Chen Lanying, a 21-year-old female worker from Taizhou at the Yong'an Yarn Factory, and her younger sister, Chen Xiao'er, 19 years old, and Zhou Zhaodi, 21 years old, from Yancheng, etc., were taken to Shanghai and raised by a worker named Li since they were young because they had lost their parents, and made them work. The year before last, when Lanying was 19 years old</p>
<h3>"Law" and "Human Sentiment"</h3>
<p>— Quiet Observer</p>
<p>The "Endangering the Republic Case" of Shen Junru and the other seven gentlemen was opened for trial at the Jiangsu High Court the day before yesterday (the 11th). The judge has not yet pronounced judgment, and the outcome is currently unknown. Looking at general public opinion, most people hope they can be acquitted and released.</p>
<p>I am reminded of an ancient saying, "The kingly way is nothing more than human sentiment."</p>
<p>This is truly a golden prescription that will never fade! Be it the kingly way or the hegemonic way, be it impeccably grand classics or solemn and brilliant laws, they may rule the world with thunderous force; yet, there is always a truth residing coldly in everyone's heart, evaluating all right and wrong. This is "human sentiment." The common people are straightforward; their minds cannot hold so many articles. The grand principle is that anything that is considerate of human sentiment and reasonable, meeting the needs of the majority, is the basis of its existence. Otherwise, they will repay you with silent contempt.</p>
<p>It is said that the world is becoming increasingly civilized, and the only proof is that we have many laws, as strict as nets, densely covering the world, to eliminate all barbarism and evil. But conversely, the number of criminals is increasing. Is there anyone who loves crime as a habit? The reason lies in one thing: society is unreasonable, and the laws cannot adapt to the environment and era to compensate for society's defects, thus becoming unreasonable.</p>
<p>Forcing someone into a crime due to petty jealousy is the best example.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a news item appeared in the newspaper about a young girl who was already engaged and fell in love with a young man from the market. She became pregnant, and the young man's mother encouraged her to hire a midwife to induce an abortion. The matter was revealed, and the court filed a public prosecution. Abortion violates the prohibition, so the result of the trial was that the girl, the midwife, and the young man's mother were all guilty, while the young man alone was not held accountable. We think, is there anything more unreasonable in the world? Yet, according to the law, that is how it should be judged.</p>
<p>Therefore, in court, only the judge asks questions, and the defendant is not allowed to ask questions in return.</p>
<p>Getting rid of an unborn child is against morality, yes. But what if it isn't aborted? Does our society allow young girls to raise illegitimate children?</p>
<p>If such a counter-question were asked, the law would collide with the stone wall of human sentiment. Although the reasoning would still be extremely grand, it would be very "hegemonic."</p>
<p>However, it is not right to definitively say that the law does not consider human sentiment. But then there is another saying, "The situation is excusable, but the law is inexorable."</p>
<h3>Movement for Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment</h3>
<p>— Li Yinfei</p>
<p>The Movement for Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment is now in its third year. In these three years, there have been some achievements: "The draft constitution announced on May 5, 1936, has a special article on the national compensation system: the National Judicial Conference has already resolved to have the Judicial Yuan submit it to the Legislative Yuan; this year's movement has resulted in a preliminary draft." It seems that the sound of footsteps is on the stairs, but when the person will come down is still unknown, and after the person comes down, whether it will be implemented, and to what extent it will be implemented, is even more uncertain.</p>
<p>Regarding the law, my knowledge is really too inadequate; however, I cannot say that I have no connection to it. In this prosperous age, "misfortune often comes from the sky while sitting at home." The situations vary in different places. There have been precedents where a red-covered "Call to Arms" was used to condemn someone as "reactionary." Those who usually can't help but read a little to fill their poor bellies are inevitably filled with apprehension, as if walking on thin ice.</p>
<p>Now, the preliminary draft of "Compensation for Wrongful Imprisonment" is reportedly complete. When it will be announced and implemented is still unknown, but after implementation, "because the establishment of the compensation system for wrongful imprisonment will not only provide unlimited comfort, both spiritually and materially, to those who have suffered injustice and have been vindicated, healing the wounds inflicted on their hearts; but from a proactive perspective, it will enable officials in charge of criminal penalties to calmly and quietly seek the truth when hearing cases, without distorting the law, perfunctorily following procedures, or even fabricating unfounded charges," it will probably be able to achieve more or less. Although, "a perfect legal system should have no sentences," the existence of wrongful imprisonment already indicates that this country and society is not very sophisticated; and whether every wrongful imprisonment can be "vindicated" cannot be guaranteed now. However, it is better to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. "Judicial officials, mindful of the gravity of their responsibility, will examine cases and render judgments with greater care, indirectly achieving a preventive effect to some extent, which would generally be beneficial."</p>
<p>Therefore, I am extremely willing to provide as much support as I can for this "loud appeal" by the Bar Association, and because of this, I feel that the Bar Association's decision to only advocate and publicize it in June each year is too short, and there is a danger of sporadic effort.</p>
<p>And in addition to compensation for wrongful imprisonment, what cannot be left unsaid is how to ensure the implementation of the already established laws. Taking "small matters" as an example, such as the police often seen beating hawkers on the streets, is there such a provision in the law? And the detention must not exceed 24 hours, and if it exceeds the time, it must be sent to the court for trial, etc., I am afraid that only intellectuals who belong to the "higher Chinese" can enjoy this "privilege," right?</p>
<p>Naturally, this question is again reduced to "compensation for wrongful imprisonment," but before the law on "compensation for wrongful imprisonment" is announced and implemented, is this phenomenon allowed to exist?</p>
<p>And in various culturally backward villages, the law has become the genealogy of the gentry, which is even more of an "exception."</p>
<h3>A Visit to Ward Road Jail</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>The young children are divided into two categories: one is those sentenced to confinement in reformatories, and the other is those sentenced to confinement in prisons. This is because the First Special District Court often sentences young children aged 15 or younger to imprisonment, and youths aged 18 or 19 to reformatories, so they have to be confined separately, but their treatment is the same. The young children in the reformatory attend classes in the morning and learn crafts in the afternoon, while the other youths learn crafts in the morning and attend classes in the afternoon. Those with good behavior can also play various games in their spare time. Some young children study very diligently in the reformatory and have pure and kind natures, but once released from prison, they are again tempted by villains and become pickpockets. One young child explained the reason for his return to prison, saying, "If you don't steal outside, you'll starve to death." This is also the truth, so Assistant Warden Mr. Yan C.Y. Yen has contacted the business community to find jobs for many young children who have completed their sentences, but unfortunately, the public is not very enthusiastic about supporting this, and only the "Salvation Army Assistance for Released Prisoners Department" and a few other charitable organizations are willing to help, but unfortunately, they are all unable to do much because of insufficient funds. Anyone who has committed a crime and been in prison, no matter how willing he is to repent and start anew, others always feel some aversion to him. Therefore, finding jobs for these released youths makes people shake their heads at the first mention, which is the case in all countries, and Shanghai is naturally no exception.</p>
<p>Foreign criminals and foreign women are confined in another building. There are no Chinese women in Ward Road Jail. The meals of foreign prisoners are different from those of Chinese prisoners, and they enjoy more freedom than Chinese prisoners. Because there are not many of them (currently about 75), they are allowed to eat together. Except for foreigners who do not enjoy consular jurisdiction, criminals from other countries are confined in this prison, with Russians and Indians accounting for the most. Those sentenced to long-term imprisonment are confined separately. The consuls of these foreign prisoners' countries provide a certain amount of assistance per person per day. There are currently fewer than five women in the prison, who are cared for by female prison officers. They receive very good treatment. Their hardest work is making bedding and cleaning their cells, which is a task that every prisoner has to do every day.</p>
<p>Because there are so many Chinese, the working prisoners, more than two thousand, all live three to a cell. Although it feels a bit crowded, it reduces loneliness, so the prisoners prefer it. Work is a special enjoyment in the prison, because during work, they can occasionally talk to their companions, instead of being locked alone in a small room, as if in a tomb. Therefore, the working prisoners do not dare to commit offenses, lest they be expelled from the workshop and live that tomb-like life.</p>
<p>Before this new prison was built, a major prison break occurred in Shanghai in April 1929. At that time, a prisoner sentenced to death attacked a Western guard, seized a pistol, killed two Indian guards, and wounded three others. He was later shot and killed himself. After this incident, the guards in the prison were no longer allowed to carry weapons, and no one was allowed to leave the prison occasionally to deliver letters, etc., on behalf of the prisoners. We asked several prison officials why they thought the prisoners did not dare to attempt a prison break. Their answers were different. One said that because the life in the prison was better than outside, the prisoners had no intention of escaping. Another said that the prisoners knew that escaping would be difficult to succeed, so they naturally did not want to be foolish enough to do so. Both of these were quite reasonable.</p>
<p>Although the discipline in the prison is very strict, many prisoners, especially the general youths, feel quite settled in the prison. Naturally, there are also some who are very willing to get out of the cage as soon as possible. However, this is not something that children can do. The prison is surrounded by a 25-foot-high wall, and there are eleven watchtowers on the wall, guarded day and night by members of the Russian Legion. As long as there is any sign of trouble, the guard on the tower lightly presses a button, and the alarms all around will immediately sound loudly. Forty-six armed Russian soldiers, led by an officer, are ready to move out to deal with prison break incidents. In addition, there are 508 Chinese, Western, and Indian police and assistants guarding the prison.</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua</h3>
<p>— Jiu Chenhe</p>
<p>29</p>
<p>Sai Jinhua, considering the safety of the nation, and with the matter of peace hinged on her, did not refuse Li Hongzhang's request to talk to Mrs. von Ketteler. However, the wife of the ambassador because of the death of her husband insisted that the Empress Dowager pay for his life, and that the Qing emperor apologize, making Sai Jinhua feel this was reasonable and righteous, and creating difficulty for her. In the end, Sai Jinhua spoke about the greater picture, and expounded on the benefits for both nations, which finally got Mrs. Ambassador to agree to compromise.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>To be helpful. For the sake of caution, the prisoners in the prison are not allowed to gather in large numbers. Each day, physical exercises are held in several batches, with a limited number each time. Prisoners eat in their own cells. Workshops are also limited to a certain extent, and each workshop has its door tightly locked, with an armed Indian guard standing outside the door. Prisoners are locked in their cells at 4:30 p.m., so they must have roll call before dark. They must all get up at 6:00 a.m. the next morning. The bolts on the cell doors are very heavy, and one person is dedicated to guarding each row of cells. Patrolmen make their rounds at night, and the guards must report to each station on time. If an accident occurs and the guards fail to report in time, an alarm will sound automatically.</p>
<p>These facilities and security measures undoubtedly prevent many prisoners from harboring thoughts of prison break. But if Ward Road Jail were to house the same number of foreign prisoners under the same conditions, it would be impossible to guarantee that they would not engage in prison break activities. Sitting alone in a small cell every day, with no companions and no diversions, only those with good behavior who can read occasionally get some books. This situation, except for Orientals, would cause agitation and disturbances. Apart from the two daily physical exercises, the only time the prisoners can dispel their boredom is when Chinese and foreign missionaries come to preach to them on Sundays. They occasionally cannot bear it and commit suicide by hanging, but this is a rare occurrence. The hospital in the prison has slightly better food and more comfortable living conditions, so they mostly hope to get sick, but how can they hope for illness if the illness does not come? Pretending to be sick cannot fool the doctor.</p>
<p>Prisoners can be visited by family or friends once every three months for ten minutes. But visitors must stand behind the rough wire mesh in the visiting room, a few feet away, with a narrow aisle for guards to pass through in between. Prisoners are not allowed to receive gifts, so they do not have the enjoyment of comforts, because even a wisp of smoke is enough to cause a stir. Their daily cost of living is 45 cents per person, with food accounting for 12 cents. Prisoners sentenced to death are confined in a separate row of cells. They are the same as the other prisoners and hold an optimistic outlook. What they hate is that after being sentenced to death, the execution is often delayed for a long time. When they walk the "last mile," they feel more heroic and brave than people of all other races. (The End) (Translated from the English Greater Shanghai Evening Post)</p>
