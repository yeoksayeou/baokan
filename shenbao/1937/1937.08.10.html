<p>時評</p>
<h3>川越大使的南來</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>在溝橋事件初發生時。我國方面本希望事件不至擴大。能够從外交方面獲得和平的解决。於是有華北方面的和平談判。有許大使的抱病返任。蔣委員長並於十七日發表演說。指示解决蘆沟橋事件我方所持的最低立塲四點。同時我外交部對日本最後通牒的答復。亦希望能以外交手段獲得糾紛的和平解决。可是日本帝國主義的這次進攻蘆溝橋。本是吞併整個華北計劃的發端。對於我們的和平表示。非但毫不加以注意。而反派遣大批軍隊。動員全國力量。進攻華北。佔領平津等重要地區。而這時日本駐華大使川越。也滯留天津。靜觀戰事的發展。在這樣緊急的關頭。依照一般國際慣例說。中日間的外交關係早該斷絕了。可是我們為着维持和平的關係。沒有這樣做。而日本則為留待以後要求我們承認卽成事實的關係。當然更不會這樣做。因此在日本佔領平津。鞏固華北新軍事根據地後。川越大使就翩然南下。準備以最大努力來挽回中日時局的危機了。</p>
<p>據中央社的東京電訊。日本對於川越的南下。懷有極大的希望。這極大的希望是什麼呢。拆穿了說。就是希望我國能屈服於日本的槍尖下。承認它在華北所造成的卽成事實。可是現在的中國已不是數年前的中國了。我們全國上下。早已一致認定日本這次的進攻華北。已使二國關係到達最後關頭的境界。祇有發動全面的持久的抗戰。才能保全我們民族的繼續生存。現在中日外交當局。在兩國國交依然存續之際。誠如外部發言人所說。雖可隨時商談。可是我們對於這種商談。决不能抱有若何的期望。也不應抱有若何的期望。在敵人的武力威脅之下。我們除了以全面的抗戰來答覆之外。還有什麼商談的餘地。</p>
<p>現在川越大使雖仍留駐上海。準備待機入京談判。但是另一方面。日軍仍不斷增援。進攻各地。同時日本在華僑民。除了沿海一二城市外。都已奉令一律退出。在這樣的情勢下。誠如中央社東京八日路透電所稱。中日邦交等於斷絕。大戰有一觸卽發之勢。還有什麼外交談判的可能。我國外交當局現時雖不願關閉外交談判之門。可是我們要想以外交談判的方法來勸阻敵人的進攻。吐出已到口中的肥肉。乃是絕不可能的事。我們現在對於敵人的不斷進攻。除了遵照政府的指示與最高當局的抗戰主張以外。絕沒有第二條生路可走了。</p>

<p>［巴黎］關於中日兩國爭端、中國行政院副院長孔祥煕、昨向“日報”訪員、發表談話稱日本製造滿洲偽國以還、六載於茲、一般人原以為日本卽已獲有如此廣大之“殖民地”、其對於亞洲大陸所抱之野心、已可滿足、孰意該國軍部、一方面在佔領地內、努力經營、一方面更以堅强之决心、而在亞洲大陸上、賡續推行廣太之經濟軍事計劃、迨至上月初間、認為時機已熟、乃又製造蘆溝橋事件、血在華北有所舉動、蓋以華北物產豐富、實有裨於日本帝國主義之實現故也、孔氏嗣乃追述日俄戰爭以還、日本在中國經濟上所樹立之勢力、卽各國對華投資數額分配情形、其中日本佔總額百分之五十三、英國佔百分之二十四、蘇聯佔百分之九、美國佔百分之七、若以華北一隅而論、日本佔總額百分之九○·七、“日本資本家對於華北、乃以殖民地視之、但以目下情形而論、日本侵略行動、已因中國復興、而受有打擊、爰乃出以捷速行動、以冀先發制人、惟是中國無可爭論之權利、决當加以維護、日本此其所為、定必遭受嚴重之阻力”云、（中央社九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蘇聯擬向美國定造主力艦</h3>
<p>上裝十六吋口徑大砲　英人認此舉有損無益</p>
<p>［紐約］聞蘇聯政府現已開始向美訂造戰艦三艘之談判、內有一艘載重三萬五千噸、置十六吋口徑砲九尊、其建造工程早已在討論中、茲聞蘇聯將備價購置此類戰艦三艘、查此事在今年三月間卽曾談及、但當時美國不願代為建造、因蘇聯要求（一）戰艦各砲須經美國海軍加以檢查並出具證明書、（二）各艦須裝置十六吋口徑大砲也、今蘇聯已放棄美海軍檢查之要求、而美國卽已决定美艦改置十六吋口徑之大砲、自不能不為蘇聯代製此種大砲也、（中央社九日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］蘇聯政府自與美國各造船廠進行談判、訂造三萬五千噸主力艦一艘、並擬配以十六吋口徑砲位之後、英國人士頃加以評論、以為此乃外交上不幸之事、卽在技術上亦屬謬誤之舉、蓋以外交而論、蘇聯訂造主力艦一層、一經證明屬實、日本自必起而效尤、並倣照美俄兩國辦法、而採用十六吋口徑砲位、因此、海軍競爭、曾由倫敦與華盛頓海軍條約加以限制者、勢必因而得一新推動、又况此舉對於德國造艦計劃、亦必發生影響、英德兩國前比煞費苦心、所成立之海軍協定、或且因而發生問題、亦未可知、至以技術而論、英國海軍界人士以為、波羅的海已為德國所控制、蘇聯所當建造之三萬五千噸主方艦一艘、一旦完成、恐亦無用武之地、抑且易為德國濟水艇所秉、加以蘇聯北部唯一不凍之港、可成為蘇聯海軍根據地者、惟有摩孟斯克港一處、亦嫌不敷應用、再則、此種主力艦只數、若能與日本相等、自可在遠東方面發揮威力、設僅一艘之微、實亦無濟於事云、（中央社九日哈丸斯電）</p>

<h3>抗戰專頁</h3>
<p>我們的抗戰</p>
<p>敵人侵略的野心，是無止境的，現在又在吞噬我們的華北了。我們已經到了最後的關頭，為了求國家民族的生存，我們决計不惜任何犧牲！</p>
<p>㊀武力戰：就是動員全國的軍隊，集中一切武力，和敵拚命。</p>
<p>㊁經濟戰：包括財政，交通，工業，農業上種種的準備，予敵人以重創。</p>
<p>㊂外交戰：就是儘量利用國際間的利害關係，竭办運絡各國，謀取他們物質上或精神上的援助。</p>
<p>㊃思想戰：利用無綫電，報紙等工具，廣事宣傳敵人的暴行，以激勵我方的民氣，而使敵方的民衆，厭棄侵略的戰爭。</p>
<p>如果我們能够注意到以上各點，而努力去幹的話，我想我們的勝利，一定是很有把握的。（逢渠）</p>
<h3>吳稚老—談捐款救國</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>黨國要人吳稚老，談鋒最健，日來有人以“捐款救國”事叩其意見，稚老卽席大發宏論，言多中肯，吳云：</p>
<p>“救國不是空喊口號的事，空喊是徒勞無益的，譬如乞丐問人家要錢，人若無錢，任憑如何哀號，也是無用的，救國亦如此。</p>
<p>目前國事日亟，老百姓們固應量力輸將，盡點責任，而做官的更應身先民衆，負起“領導民衆的責任。我看見有許多做官的朋友，平時，建洋房，買汽車，請酒席，揮金似土，而對國事却一毛不拔，這種心理挺要不得。我們讀明史，崇禎當朝，强寇時侵，君王請各大臣捐款，招兵買馬，而各位大臣異口同聲說窮，並且將家庭裝得一貧如洗，結果明朝滅亡，這些大臣並不見得會有好處，這眞是前車可鑒，怎不可憂呢！</p>
<p>最近，凱末爾，希特拉，都以私人家產捐贈政府，看得國比家重，因為無國就無家，這種觀念，最值得倣效，於此，我希望我國的上下官員，也都移愛家的熱心來愛國，那不須幾年，中國是一定會强盛的。”</p>
<h3>廢物救國</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>“窮雖窮，家中還有三担銅”，這是我們中國的一句古諺。雖然在事實上，未必眞是每家均有三担铜，然而平均起來，每家十斤八斤的廢銅爛鐵，總也還有。德國因原料缺乏，而在四年計劃中，提倡把廢銅爛鐵貢獻國家，以供非常時期之用。我們中國的非常時期，已是迫臨在眼前了。我們對於堆置在壁角中的廢銅爛鐵，該發生着怎麽的一個感想呢？</p>
<p>上回，某要人遊蘇，對於我們的服裝改良問題，曾主張把長衫旗袍，各减短一尺。每入每件衣服，省一尺，全國便可省着四萬萬尺的衣料。這雖是道人所未道的話然而却是具有至理的。因為在實際上，可省的東西，不知節省，那便是廢物。從這一個理論中，我想在這非常時期到臨的今日，大家對於手指上的金約指，應該也要有一種醒覺。把金指套在手指上，究竟有甚麼意義呢。那還不是十足道地的廢物麼？意大利對阿作戰時，一般國民，都把結婚約指，贈給政府，而終於把阿征服了。我們中國，四萬萬人，平均每人捐贈一分金給政府，便可籌得四百萬兩的黃金。試思以四百萬兩黃金，為政府打一個落花流水麼？</p>
<p>在不久以前，舊報紙的價格，飛漲着。當時便曾一度謠傳着，有某國人，在收買着，供製造炸彈之用。雖然這個謠傳，未經證實，然而這幾天來，因着非常時期的日迫，有人在收買廢銅爛鐵，以供製造槍砲，是甚囂塵上了。德國重視廢銅爛鐵，意人願把黃金捐贈國家，而我們中國人，却還漠然地出售着廢銅爛鐵，間接資敵，這是該從那裏說起呢？</p>
<h3>蘆溝橋戰士之詩</h3>
<p>— 勾覺先</p>
<p>友人吳君，去年投筆從戒，隸河北某軍，蓋正在前方，負戈衛國，與敵人决生死者·頃得其自戰地來函，并附詩三首，亟錄之，以饗讀者：</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>積恥連年非一朝，敵騎今又到蘆橋，忍看國士拱蠶食，誓殺樓蘭不肯饒，大刀起處人頭落，鐵臂揮時賊膽消，只是將軍心未决，和聲雜共戰聲囂。</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>茫茫家國竟何之，肝膽欲焚妥協時，武將有心殲虜賊，文官無意復城池，永定河邊風瑟瑟，蘆溝橋下水澌澌，可憐昨夜酣爭處，今日鳴金又罷師。</p>
<p>其三</p>
<p>男兒有志事長征，報國何嘗計死生，擲把頭顱為彈子，黏將血肉作長城，馬前殺賊心方足，紙上談兵計總平，寄語關中諸俊傑，斯時不戰更何營？</p>
<h3>棋局</h3>
<h3>題趙將軍登禹打虎圖</h3>
<p>— 陳靄</p>
<p>片紙留精爽。誰是戎裝者。奮身虎背上。揮拳而怒打。此乃趙將軍。令我敬拜下。意態眞雄傑。稍稍帶潇洒。膽包將軍身。鐵鑄將軍　。當時事馮公。殺賊每盈野。圖此寄遠志。馮公不忍舍。將軍今果作國殤。徵取忠烈之非常。夢魂試繞南苑路。方知將軍打者非僅虎。使我攬此淚如雨</p>
<h3>時候到了</h3>
<p>幾時曾經有過？全國這樣的齊心，幾時曾經有過？全國這樣的振奮，像獅子跳出了囚籠，一罄怒吼天地驚震！連上蒼也說是時候到了中華現在要戰勝日本。</p>

<h3>古典的抗日談</h3>
<p>— 錐心</p>
<p>▼后羿射日　古代神話，開天有十日，后羿善射，以强弩射去其九，所以現在祇餘一“日”了。是以若論抗日央雄，后羿實是古今第一人，可惜今無后羿其人，否則此”“日”，再賞它箭，至少也可稍滅其毒燄咧。</p>
<p>▼夸父追日　山海經云：“奈父欲追日影，遂之於暘谷之際，渴欲飲，赴河飲，不足，將走北，飲大澤中，未至渴死，　其杖，膏肉所侵，生鄧林竹，廣闊數十里。夸父的追逐日影，可謂憑極，然其至死奮鬥的精神，實足欽佩，况且追日而死，精誠所結，仍能化作鄧林竹，以資蔽日禦日，甚抗日精神，洵為千古不朽了？！</p>
<p>▼蜀犬吠日　韓文：“蜀地山高少日，日出則羣犬吠之”。其實，蜀大也許並非少見多怪，只因深知暴日毒燄所至之處，民無曛類，所以一見暴日，卽羣起而吠，意欲驅此暴日耳，吾人如無抗日的勇氣，眞蜀犬之不如了！</p>
<p>▼白虹貫日　史記：“荊軻入秦刺秦王，燕太子丹送於易水，歌曰：“風瀟瀟兮易水寒，壯士去兮不復返！精誠感天，白虹貫日。”後來刑卿事雖不成，慷慨就義；但其除暴之志，早具一死决心，所以精誠所凝，白虹貫日，這種壯烈之氣，也可傳之千古了。按：白虹是象徵荊卿，“日”是象徵暴君，“暴日”二字，據此益覺是徵而有信。</p>
<p>▼田父曝日列子“宋有田父曝日，不知天下之有廣廈　室，綿纊狐貉，謂妻曰：“負日之喧，人莫知者，當以獻吾君，必有重賞。…………”按這一個故典，列子雖能紀其事實，却把田父的本意完全誤解了。試想：田父自己雖沒有住過廣厦　室，衣過綿纊狐貉，難道就連見也沒有見過嗎？他的曝日，分明還是在六月裏的大熱天氣呢。何以故？因為冬天曝日，當不致有“人莫知者”之感，惟有在夏日大熱之天，暴日大肆毒燄，這田天性情剛烈，偏偏不怕毒燄，故意在暴日下曝之，以鍜鍊其抗日精神，所以自謂“當以獻吾君，必有重賞”也。可惜列子不知其意，反笑他是淺見，其實，知己知彼，百戰百勝，田父的曝日，正欲把自己的銅皮鐵骨，去和暴日抵抗一下，試試毒日究有多大兇燄？是否就能蒸死人，再將此意獻於其君，便可使舉國之人，不致畏日如虎了。</p>

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson States That Kawagoe Will Travel to Nanjing Soon</h3>
<p>To Hold Talks with Our Authorities - Whether Negotiations Will Begin Is Yet Undetermined - Unforgettable Focus on On-Site Resolution</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Today, the Foreign Ministry spokesperson issued an important statement to news reporters regarding the North China crisis, stating that if Song Zheyuan's successor can fulfill the conditions of the local agreements of July 11th and 19th, the North China incident can be resolved locally. Part of it has already been fulfilled by Song Zheyuan himself. (9th Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] On the afternoon of the 9th, when the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson met with foreign reporters, he answered various questions as follows: Japanese residents along the Yangtze River were ordered to evacuate completely. Only women and children evacuated from Japanese residents in Guangzhou and Shantou. There was no evacuation around Xiamen. Kawagoe can go to Beijing soon to hold talks with the Chinese authorities, but it is difficult to say whether negotiations will begin immediately, and so on. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It is heard that Kawagoe may go to Nanjing to talk with the leaders of the Chinese government, but it is not known whether he will conduct formal negotiations with the Chinese government. It is also heard that the Japanese government did not send new instructions to Kawagoe. (Central News Agency 9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the situation between China and Japan has become increasingly tense, with a tendency to cause a long-term war. According to observers, the Japanese residents have now withdrawn from the Yangtze River basin, and diplomatic relations between China and Japan are equivalent to being severed. Therefore, there is a view that the war may reopen within the coming week. The Nanjing reporter of the "Mainichi Shimbun" stated that the Japanese Embassy and naval and army authorities, considering that diplomatic and peaceful negotiations cannot proceed under the current situation, decided at a meeting held on August 6th that Ambassador Kawagoe had no need to enter Nanjing. Therefore, Kawagoe will not go to Nanjing in the near future. Furthermore, Japan knows that Western countries have no intention of intervening, so it is mobilizing a large number of troops to "carry out a radical surgical operation to fundamentally eliminate the threat to 'Manchukuo'." (8th Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The 2,200 Japanese residents in Beiping who moved into the embassy area from July 27th returned to their homes today.

<h3>Two Memorial Weeks in the Central Government</h3>
<p>He Yingqin Reports on Japanese Newspaper's Rumors - Chairman Lin Speaks on Self-Existence and Co-Existence</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Party Headquarters held its 88th Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the 9th. More than 30 Central Committee members, including Yu Youren, Ding Weifen, Ye Chucang, Sun Ke, He Yingqin, Jun Li Zi, Chu Minyi, Chen Shaokuan, Li Wenfan, Jing Hengyi, Lin Yunjie, Fang Zhi, and Cheng Qian, and about 700 working comrades attended. After Chairman Yu led the ceremony, Yu gave an impromptu report, followed by He Yingqin's report, which concluded at 9:30 AM. The original text of He Yingqin's report is as follows: Chairman and comrades, today I have a few words to report to you solemnly. Originally, at this critical moment of national crisis, the comrades of our Party, compatriots across the country, and especially the officers and soldiers of the entire army, should be wholeheartedly united and diligently work under the unified will of our supreme leader, each fulfilling their duties. However, what I want to bring up today concerns the issue of rumors spread by Japanese newspapers. The Japanese have always considered China to be a country of rumors and the Chinese people to be a nation that likes to believe rumors. Therefore, among the various methods of aggression against China, they have used the method of spreading rumors to achieve their aims of discord, provocation, and incitement to division. It can be said that in the many unfortunate events in our country's history, the Japanese intelligence agencies and their domestic or China-published newspapers and magazines have had a part dedicated to doing this kind of rumor work. What I am saying today is not based on 空中樓閣 or speculation, but is observed from the Japanese consistent policy towards China. You only need to look at the following charts (omitted) to know how thorough and ubiquitous the Japanese method of spreading rumors is, and how malicious it is. Three or five years ago, the Chinese would have been greatly fooled. For example, in the past, when the Japanese wanted to provoke恶感 between a certain地方 and the central government, they would spread various news in the newspapers for several days, either saying that the central government was going to replace a certain local leader, or saying that the situation in a certain place was unstable, constantly provoking both sides and constantly spreading rumors. As a result, some foreigners were skeptical and confused. However, modern Chinese people can be said that no one believes anymore. Since last year, people across the country have become aware, and the Japanese tricks have not had the slightest effect. Recently, since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, our whole country has united in sincerity, handling and responding under the government's established national policy under the leadership of the supreme leader. However, while the Japanese side is transporting troops and weapons and constantly pressing in, not hesitating to expand the situation, they are also creating rumors in the newspapers, making up things, saying that so-and-so advocated such-and-such, or that so-and-so advocated such-and-such but failed and how-and-how, creating something out of nothing, deliberately confusing the issue, and exhausting their ability to be divisive and诡谲. Foreigners who understand the inside story of China can analyze their rumors and know that they are absolutely inaccurate. Today, I especially bring this point up to report, meaning that I hope all the comrades of our Party, the compatriots across the country, and especially the officers and soldiers of the entire army, will deeply understand that the other side's spreading of rumors is its consistent policy of aggression. At this time when the country is in danger of survival, only by unifying our will, aligning our steps, obeying orders, and striving hard under the leadership of the central government's supreme leader, can we break through the dangerous environment in front of us, gradually move into the light, and have infinite hope for the revival of the country and the nation. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held its Memorial Week at 9:00 AM on the 9th. More than 400 people attended, including Bai Wenwei, Zhang Ji, Zhu Qinglan, Chen Xunyong, Chen Qicai, Lü Chao, Wei Huai, and others, as well as staff from the National Government and various ministries and commissions. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he gave an impromptu report on "Self-Existence and Co-Existence," which concluded at 9:30 AM. The original text of Chairman Lin's report is as follows: Everyone, it has been a full month since the Lugouqiao case occurred. From the beginning, our central government held the greatest degree of tolerance and repeatedly stated that as long as we are not forced to the last moment of our nation's survival, we always hope to use peaceful means to save the final calamity of the two major nations of East Asia. Our side, based on the lowest limit of the position, repeatedly and peacefully negotiated with the Japanese side, not hesitating to compromise and seek perfection, wanting to find a glimmer of light in the stalemate. Especially under the dangerous situation of the Japanese side increasing troops and provoking conflicts everywhere, our Hebei-Chahar authorities repeatedly negotiated to stop the conflicts and agreed to withdraw troops. However, the Japanese side repeatedly broke its promises and broke faith, completing the general transportation of troops and weapons and various military arrangements under the cover of negotiating peace, and eventually occupied Pingjin, bombed cultural institutions, strafed innocent people, and destroyed Nankai University, our famous highest institution of learning in the East. In addition to airplanes flying low and bombing, they also used kerosene to burn it. Such brutal behavior is not tolerated or committed by those who are called civilized humans. When we look at the neighboring country's recent increase in military budgets, constant military actions, fleets busy transporting, airplanes illegally flying everywhere in our airspace, the complete withdrawal of consulates and residents in various places, and the closing of businesses in China, these can prove that the other side is determined to engage in aggressive war and is willing to be the chief culprit in destroying world peace. Therefore, if the two major nations of the East reach a point of mutual injury in the future, or even end up perishing together, this responsibility for harming future generations and destroying world peace undoubtedly lies not with China, but with Japan. As for bombing cultural institutions and massacring innocent people, this irrational behavior, especially leaves an indelible stain on civilized humans and future history. It is hoped that the government of our同文同種 neighboring country will earnestly reflect on this. Since ancient times, there has been no century of仇 between countries. China and Japan are brotherly nations and are two major countries representing the status of East Asia and Oriental culture. They should support each other and embark on the path of self-existence and co-existence. They should not harm each other and embark on the path of perishing together. The Premier often said these words to people in the neighboring country in Japan. Even when he last passed through Japan and went north, when he talked to newspaper reporters, he still贯轍 this proposition. It is a pity that the neighboring country did not deeply understand these profound theories and our Premier's great proposition. This is the misfortune of the two major nations of the East. We believe it is regrettable. In short, we have reached this stage, and we should understand that it is no longer a time when justice can be extended by merely appealing to reason. We must have the strength and display of self-defense and self-existence before we can realize the hope of helping and co-existing. Our country has a vast territory, abundant resources, and a large population. In terms of national strength, it is no less than the neighboring country. What we lack is human organization and strength, and material aspects are far inferior to others. But as long as the whole country is united in sincerity and harmony, and under the leadership of a unified government, with organization and discipline, then we can naturally cope with the current situation. Now, I especially put forward two points to ask the people of the country to pay attention to: ① Compose oneself, the spirit of composing oneself is originally the self-cultivation we should have. We must have the spirit of composing oneself to be a truly modern and healthy national. We know that according to the statistics of the European war, the ones really directly killed by airplanes and poison gas are not many, and instead, those sacrificed by self-disturbance are quite a lot. The people in charge of air defense and protection against毒氣 have already explained this truth very thoroughly. Therefore, the people of our country must maintain calmness, each maintain their livelihood, maintain order and stability of finance, work hard to produce, and accept government guidance and orders at any time, taking on various tasks. Do not panic or believe in rumors, disturbing each other. Being able to do so directly benefits oneself and indirectly benefits the country. This is the foundation of all methods for the people to cope with the crisis and strive for survival. ② Protecting foreign nationals is what international law must abide by, and also a responsibility that a country and nation's morality should bear. No matter how the other party uses various methods to massacre our innocent compatriots, we should still maintain the style of a great nation and the morality of civilized humans, and still do our best to protect the merchants and people residing in our country, keeping them safe. We must understand that the neighboring country's aggressive policy is not the intention of all the people in that country. This is what we want the people of the country to pay attention to. As for the safety of life and property of the foreign nationals of other friendly countries, we must do our utmost to provide effective protection. It goes without saying that the above two points are wished to be paid attention by compatriots. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Party Headquarters held its 88th Memorial Week at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 9th. Chairman Yu Youren gave an impromptu report on spiritual unity and national survival and freedom, briefly stating that the meaning of our rising up to fight this time is for national freedom and national survival. Today, we can only mobilize the minds and strength of the whole nation to resist those who are侵略 us for the sake of our motherland, freedom, and survival. We must recognize the doctrine and the era, and we must absolutely uphold the Three Principles of the People as the only supreme doctrine for saving China. Now everyone knows that there is a country after there is a doctrine, and there is a doctrine after there is a country. The country is higher than everything, and the doctrine is also higher than everything. National affairs are extremely urgent, and everyone's responsibility is 万倍 heavier. We seek to complete the unity of sincerity. Now we are all taking 英勇 and consistent fight against the enemy, to show our 和淚和血 中怀。To make the formerly incomplete things well-rounded and from the non-thoughtful to thoughtful, to unite sincerely under the主议, to take the path of national freedom, the success of doctrine, and the ultimate victory of the national finally depended on 令日's.

<h3>Long Yun Flew to Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Bai Chongxi and Liu Xiang Visit Chairman Lin - Ma Zhanshan Goes to Shanxi to Meet with Yan Xishan and Transfer to Suiyuan</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At present, the national crisis is serious and has reached a final juncture. Military and political leaders from various places have been coming to Nanjing in recent days to ask the central authorities for important guidance. Long Yun, Chairman of the Yunnan Provincial Government, accompanied by Gong Zizhi, Director of the Education Department, and Pei Cunfan, Provincial Party Committee Member, a group of five people, arrived in Nanjing by Eurasia flight from Chengdu at 5:30 PM on the 9th. Many people from all walks of life in Nanjing went to welcome them. There were Yao Weixin, representative of Chairman Chiang, Chu Minyi, representative of Chairman Wang, He Yingqin, Minister of Military and Political Affairs, Yu Feipeng, Minister of Transportation, Gu Zhutong, Director of the Shaanxi 行營, Yang Jie, President of the Army University, Lv Zhiyi, He Sui, and Zhang Weihan, members of the Legislative Yuan, and representatives from all walks of life, Hu Ruoyu, Zhou Xiaobo, and others, totaling more than a hundred people. After the plane landed, Chairman Long and his staff disembarked. Long, wearing a gray long gown, was vigorous and shook hands with the welcomers one by one to express his thanks. Then, he and Minister He took a car into the city to rest. Reporters visited, and Long published the following remarks. Long first said that this was his first time coming to Nanjing. He greatly admired the outstanding construction of the city along the way. He thought that the construction of other parts must be even more beautiful and unparalleled. Second, he said that the central government had repeatedly convened various important meetings over the years. Because he was far away in the border province and his duties kept him busy, he was unable to come to Nanjing as scheduled. Now that the national crisis is extremely serious and has reached a final juncture, he was summoned to come. Chairman Chiang has a clear direction on the major plans of the country and has made it known to China and the world. In addition to wholeheartedly supporting the established national policy and accepting orders, he has no other opinions or contributions to offer. Things have come to this point, and it is right to talk less nonsense and take on more responsibility. As a responsible person for local administration, he should contribute all the manpower and financial resources of the locality to the country, sacrifice everything, and fight to the end in order to save the country from danger. (9th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

(TASS dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(TASS Shanghai dispatch on the 9th) According to official sources, before the White Russians, instigated by the Japanese intelligence agency in Tianjin, looted the Soviet Consulate, Soviet Consul Smirnov had already received a report. He immediately notified the Tianjin Consular Corps of the details and, in order to maintain the work of the consulate, followed instructions from his superiors to temporarily move all the consulate's documents and files to the concession for safekeeping in advance. According to reliable sources, the looters who entered the consulate last time found nothing. They have now begun to forge various documents in an attempt to prove the existence of a so-called secret Sino-Soviet anti-Japanese agreement and the absurd and unfounded existence of the so-called Communist International activities. Although this despicable trick is completely unfounded, it has the potential to confuse those who hear about it. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention and not be misled to avoid spiritual and financial losses.</p>

<h3>Ambassador Kawagoe's Arrival in the South</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, our country hoped that the incident would not escalate and could be resolved peacefully through diplomatic means. Thus, there were peaceful negotiations in North China, and Ambassador Xu returned to his post despite his illness. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also delivered a speech on the 17th, outlining the four minimum conditions held by our side for resolving the Marco Polo Bridge Incident. At the same time, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' response to Japan's ultimatum also hoped to achieve a peaceful resolution of the dispute through diplomatic means. However, this attack on the Marco Polo Bridge by Japanese imperialism was the beginning of a plan to annex the entire North China. It not only paid no attention to our expression of peace, but instead sent a large number of troops and mobilized the strength of the entire country to attack North China and occupy important areas such as Pingjin. At this time, Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe also stayed in Tianjin, watching the development of the war. In such an emergency, according to general international practice, diplomatic relations between China and Japan should have been severed long ago. However, in order to maintain peaceful relations, we did not do so. And Japan, in order to wait for the opportunity to ask us to recognize the fait accompli in the future, of course, would not do so. Therefore, after Japan occupied Pingjin and consolidated its new military base in North China, Ambassador Kawagoe gracefully traveled south, ready to make the greatest efforts to salvage the crisis in Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency's Tokyo dispatch, Japan has great hopes for Kawagoe's arrival in the south. What is this great hope? To put it bluntly, it is to hope that our country can succumb to the bayonets of Japan and recognize the fait accompli it has created in North China. But the current China is no longer the China of a few years ago. We have all unanimously recognized that Japan's attack on North China has brought the relations between the two countries to the final juncture. Only by launching a full-scale and sustained war of resistance can we preserve the continued survival of our nation. Now, while diplomatic relations between China and Japan are still in existence, as the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, although negotiations can be held at any time, we must not have any expectations for such negotiations, nor should we have any expectations. Under the threat of the enemy's force, what room is there for us to negotiate other than responding with a full-scale war of resistance?</p>
<p>Now, although Ambassador Kawagoe is still stationed in Shanghai, preparing to wait for an opportunity to enter the capital for negotiations, on the other hand, the Japanese army is still constantly reinforcing and attacking various places. At the same time, Japanese residents in China, except for a few coastal cities, have all been ordered to withdraw. Under such circumstances, as Reuters reported from Tokyo on the 8th, Sino-Japanese relations are equivalent to being severed, and a major war is imminent. What possibility is there for diplomatic negotiations? Although our diplomatic authorities are currently unwilling to close the door to diplomatic negotiations, it is impossible for us to dissuade the enemy from attacking and spitting out the fat meat that has already reached its mouth through diplomatic negotiations. We now have no second way out other than following the government's instructions and the supreme authorities' claims for war of resistance in the face of the enemy's continuous attacks.</p>
<h3>Nobel Peace Prize</h3>
<p>Swedish Newspaper Opposes Awarding it to Eden</p>
<p>⊙ Stockholm, Sweden Recently, some have advocated that this year's Nobel Peace Prize should be awarded to British Foreign Secretary Eden. The Swedish Liberal Party's organ newspaper, the News, recently commented on this matter, saying, "Foreign Secretary Eden, with regard to peace institutions, although he can consolidate them, and politicians and diplomats, although they have good intentions for international peace, inevitably adopt politically circuitous means in its implementation. Therefore, the Nobel Peace Prize does not seem suitable for such people. Looking back to the period of the European War, the Peace Prize was once awarded to the International Red Cross. Now, a precedent can be followed and the prize awarded to the Swedish Red Cross, since its President, Prince Carl of Sweden, was also a candidate for last year's Peace Prize.

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Declares China's Determination to Resist</h3>
<p>Foreign Investment in China 50% Held by Japan; Greed Will Surely Be Punished</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, stated to a reporter from "Le Journal" yesterday that since Japan created the puppet state of Manchukuo six years ago, people originally thought that Japan had already obtained such a vast "colony" and that its ambitions for the Asian continent would be satisfied. Unexpectedly, the Japanese military, on the one hand, worked hard to manage the occupied territories, and on the other hand, continued to implement vast economic and military plans on the Asian continent with a firm determination. Until early last month, they believed that the time was ripe and created the Lugouqiao Incident, engaging in military actions in North China. This was because North China is rich in resources and is beneficial to the realization of Japanese imperialism. Kong then recalled the power established by Japan in the Chinese economy since the Russo-Japanese War, that is, the distribution of investment amounts in China by various countries. Among them, Japan accounted for 53% of the total, the United Kingdom accounted for 24%, the Soviet Union accounted for 9%, and the United States accounted for 7%. Taking North China as an example, Japan accounts for 90.7% of the total. "Japanese capitalists regard North China as a colony, but in the current situation, Japan's aggression has been hit by China's revival. Therefore, they have resorted to rapid action in the hope of preempting the attack. However, China's indisputable rights must be safeguarded, and Japan's actions will surely suffer serious resistance," he said. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Plans to Order Battleships from the United States</h3>
<p>Equipped with 16-inch Caliber Guns; British Believe This Move is More Harmful Than Beneficial</p>
<p>[New York] It is reported that the Soviet government has begun negotiations with the United States to order three battleships, one of which will be 35,000 tons and equipped with nine 16-inch caliber guns. The construction project has long been under discussion. It is now reported that the Soviet Union will prepare to purchase three such battleships. This matter was discussed as early as March this year, but at that time, the United States was unwilling to build them, because the Soviet Union requested (1) that the guns of the battleships be inspected by the United States Navy and issued with certificates, and (2) that each ship be equipped with 16-inch caliber guns. Now the Soviet Union has abandoned the requirement of inspection by the US Navy, and the United States has decided to modify US warships to install 16-inch caliber guns, so it cannot but manufacture such guns for the Soviet Union.

<p>[London] After the Soviet government conducted negotiations with various shipyards in the United States to order a 35,000-ton battleship and planned to equip it with 16-inch caliber guns, British personnel have commented that this is an unfortunate event diplomatically, and a mistake technically. From a diplomatic point of view, once the Soviet Union's order for a battleship is proven to be true, Japan will inevitably follow suit, and adopt 16-inch caliber guns in accordance with the methods of the United States and Russia. Therefore, naval competition, which was restricted by the London and Washington Naval Treaties, will inevitably be given a new impetus. Moreover, this move will also affect Germany's shipbuilding plan. The naval agreement established by the painstaking efforts of the United Kingdom and Germany may be affected, which is unknown. As far as technology is concerned, British naval circles believe that the Baltic Sea has been controlled by Germany. The 35,000-ton battleship that the Soviet Union should build, once completed, may be useless, and it is easy to be seized by German submarines. In addition, the only ice-free port in the northern part of the Soviet Union that can be used as a naval base is the port of Murmansk, which is also insufficient for application. Furthermore, if the number of such battleships is equal to that of Japan, it can exert its power in the Far East. If there is only one, it will be of no use.

<p>[Moscow] The famous Soviet Russian aviator, Reponavsky, is now planning to take the Arctic and Alaska routes to Chicago at the beginning of this week. (National News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Union Central Aviation Club Competition Committee has officially recognized the long-distance aviation of Chkalov and others from Moscow across the Arctic to Vancouver, USA, as a new Soviet Union direct flight record. The entire journey is 8,582 kilometers and 960 meters long. However, because the route is tortuous, the actual flight distance is even longer. (TASS dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>[London] Colonel Gromov, Major Yumashev, and Captain Danin, Soviet aviators, flew an airplane from Moscow across the Arctic to San Jacinto, USA on July 12th of this year, creating a world record for long-distance flight. They arrived here from New York on the Normandie mail ship. British reporters immediately boarded the ship for interviews. According to Colonel Gromov, a regular air route across the Arctic between Moscow and San Francisco will definitely be opened within a few years.

<h3>Romania Renews Army</h3>
<p>Czech Provides Military Equipment</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest, Romanian Capital: The Romanian government has signed a contract with the Czech Republic's famous Skoda armaments factory to prepare for the mechanization of the Romanian army. This contract has been reviewed by King Carol of the country and the government for several months, and is the last step in the military program of the current Romanian government. In addition, the Skoda factory will assist Romania in manufacturing ammunition within its own borders, and will build a new arsenal, employing 4,000 workers. In addition, Poland has also assisted Romania in manufacturing gas masks and airplanes. The only hope of the Romanian king and his government is to enable Romania to be independent in terms of military needs, so that the source will not be cut off during wartime. It is also heard that in addition to the Skoda factory, a second group from the Czech Republic is participating in the contract, and the banks of Prague will also provide financial support. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest, Romanian Capital: Former Prime Minister Professor Yorga recently published an article in the Times, discussing Romania's foreign policy, stating, "If France adheres to various European peace treaties, and if France's military defense force does not weaken, Romania should join hands with France. He also said that although Romania and Germany have the same anti-Jewish sentiments and admire the German leader Hitler, it is not possible to immediately determine that Romania may act jointly with Germany.

<h3>Britain Expels German Reporter, Germany Protests</h3>
<p>British Police Search National Socialist Party</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the expulsion of reporters from the Berlin Local Guidance newspaper and the Graz newspaper in London, the German Chargé d'Affaires in England, Wallmann, has lodged a protest with the British Foreign Office. It is heard that the wording is still mild. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>[London] The London newspapers, including the extreme right-wing newspapers, have not questioned the British government for the reason for the expulsion of the three German reporters. Among them, the Daily Herald stated, "If the German government does not force the British government to announce the reason, we do not need to say more. German Chargé d'Affaires Wall is aware that announcing the reason for the expulsion is neither a blessing for the reporters nor conducive to the relations between Britain and Germany." The News Chronicle reported that in the next few weeks, the London Police Department will investigate the secret activities of the German National Socialist Party in London and major cities. At that time, the Home Office may expel some more foreigners, which is also unknown. (Central News Agency, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] It is heard that Germany has decided to take retaliatory action, but Berlin political circles do not want to reveal its nature. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>Transatlantic Aviation Test Flight Successful</h3>
<p>British Airplane Speed is Very Good</p>
<p>⊙ Havas: The Empire Airways' giant seaplane, the Cambria, which previously flew from Foynes Port, Ireland to Newfoundland Island for another transatlantic test flight, has arrived safely. This morning at 9:30, it flew back from Newfoundland to Foynes Port, taking a total of 12 hours and 2 minutes, with an average speed of 169 nautical miles per hour, which is the fastest of all test flights.

<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Besieges Capital City for Ten Months</h3>
<p>Residents in the Besieged City Live as Usual; Various Countries' Warships Resolve to Protect Merchant Ships</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid: Since Madrid was besieged by the rebel army, the government army has fought bravely for ten months. So far, the two sides are in a stalemate. The citizens of Madrid still have no idea when the battle will end. The authorities continue to handle the evacuation of residents in the city without stopping. Although the residents have been repeatedly persuaded to withdraw as soon as possible, most people hold the idea of staying for the time being, and very few people comply with the order to withdraw. In various squares, streets, and intersections in the city, children are often seen gathering and playing as usual, not paying attention to stray bullets flying over or shells falling. The parks in the city are no longer full of flowers and trees, but there are very many visitors. Children engage in games in the park all day long, and their mothers operate needles and threads by their side to protect them, no different from usual. Sometimes, a shell suddenly falls nearby and explodes with a bang. Only then does chaos occur, and mothers take their children to nearby houses to take shelter. But after the explosion stops, within five minutes, the park is still as lively as usual. The citizens in the besieged city are so calm and composed that foreign people cannot help but praise them. As for the large buildings in the city, they have long had a wartime atmosphere. The Telephone Company Building in the city center is surrounded by sandbags, with two-story buildings side by side. Gran Vía Street was originally a prosperous street, but it has been hit by shells the most times. The coffee shops on the street that have not yet closed have removed the street seats and replaced them with sandbags, leaving a gap in the middle, allowing customers to enter and exit freely. People generally believe that the war cannot be ended in a short period of time. If it lasts until the winter of this year, the difficulties of the residents will increase, especially the shortage of fuel. The shortage of staple food will be even worse than before. Potatoes have become a rare commodity. Although it is now the season for the production of vegetables and fresh fruits, very few fresh fruits are transported here, which is quite worrying. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid: The government army today attacked the Nationalist army in the Madrid area, using tanks and airplanes as assistance, advancing along the Canillas Avenue, wanting to cut off the rebel army's connection with Rutiles. At the same time, the government army also shelled Cabanillas, and the rebel army retreated. Another army advanced from Tertuyesgas to Salden. According to the headquarters of the government army, the traffic between Madrid and Valencia has been greatly reduced due to the government army's many victories. A semi-official source said that 500 rebel soldiers in Andalusia were killed because they refused to move the best barracks to the Italian army. Members of the Spanish fascist organization, Franco's party, protected the Italian army and surrounded the resisting soldiers. Then the scope of the conflict expanded, and Moorish troops also participated in the resistance. Many of the rebel soldiers in the Moriel area fled and surrendered to the government army, to the point where bombs and bayonets had to be used to stop them. The current situation is very dangerous, so the garrison troops have been transferred from Malaga. However, the workers in Malaga learned that the garrison troops were reduced and immediately surrounded the headquarters. At the same time, the workers in the Moriel factory also attacked the rebel army. (National News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>[　　] Regarding the attack on British, French, and Italian ships outside the French port of Algiers in Africa, the Times recently reported that "The Dutch inspector on board the Italian ship Mengchiola has clearly stated that the airplanes causing the trouble belong to the Spanish Nationalist army. The British government also knows which side the airplanes that bombed the British ship Coble belonged to in the Spanish Civil War. In this regard, the French government immediately sent gunboats and torpedo boats to travel between the country's headquarters and North African ports to assume protection after the incident. Regarding this matter, the governments of the countries concerned have reportedly ordered their respective warships to open fire on any aircraft as soon as they begin to attack any merchant ships." The Daily Herald, the organ of the Labor Party, reported that "The British government has issued a serious protest to the Spanish Nationalist army. Unfortunately, the British government's protests are often entrusted to empty words, which are not enough to attract attention. This is well known by General Franco and his colleagues."

<h3>Yugoslav Religious Dispute</h3>
<p>Prime Minister, Cabinet Members, and Dozens of Parliamentarians Announce Trial by Religious Court</p>
<p>⊙ Belgrade, Yugoslav Capital: While 2,000 people held a meeting in the Orthodox Church here, they announced a list of people who violated the orders of the religious conference, including Prime Minister Stojadinović and ten cabinet members, fifteen members of parliament. The same announcement was also made in smaller rural churches. After each person's name was read, the congregation chanted "May God punish them" in unison. This move occurred in the dispute between the Catholic and Orthodox churches over the signing of a political and religious agreement with the Vatican. The Orthodox Church believes that the agreement gives the church excessive rights and benefits, and refuses to approve it. Therefore, Catholics have cursed them. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>⊙ Belgrade, Yugoslav Capital: Regarding the religious treaty signed between the Yugoslav government and the Roman Curia, the elders of the Orthodox Christian Church strongly opposed it. Yesterday, a meeting was held, and it was decided to refer Prime Minister Stojadinović and eight other cabinet members, and about twenty members of the People's Assembly, to the religious court for trial, and temporarily deprive them of all rights on religious rights and the honors they enjoy before the court's verdict. When the decision was read in the churches, the audience was extremely crowded, many of whom were people who did not usually enter the church. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>⊙ Belgrade, Yugoslav Capital: After the Orthodox Christian Elders' Conference passed a resolution yesterday to deprive Prime Minister Stojadinović and other cabinet members and most members of the People's Assembly of their religious rights, the semi-official agency, Avala News Agency, recently published a message and commented on it, saying, "According to the opinions of experts familiar with the regulations of the Orthodox Christian Church, the decision made by the Orthodox Church Bureau yesterday is absolutely illegal, and is sufficient to cause serious damage to the meaning of the law of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia and the organization of the Orthodox Christian Church. The responsibilities of cabinet members and members of the People's Assembly in performing public duties and engaging in political activities have been clearly stipulated by the Constitution and current laws. The church has no right to interfere. Based on this, the attitude adopted by the elders is illegal, which is self-evident." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3>German Police Arrest Many Pastors</h3>
<p>Niemöller's Case Decided to Be Postponed</p>
<p>[Berlin] Pastor Meiso declared today while holding a religious ceremony in the church in the suburban Dalen district that pastors in Thuringia and Brandenburg provinces continue to be arrested. So far, the number of people arrested has reached as many as sixty-four. Among them, Hirt and Niemöller will be tried by the court soon. All believers should pray to God for these pastors and bless them. After the believers went outside, they held a demonstration on the street, demanding the release of Niemöller. One hundred and twenty people were arrested by the police, but they were released immediately. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The case of Niemöller, a famous German bishop, which was originally scheduled to open on August 10, has now been postponed due to the need to collect evidence. It is said that it is unlikely to open between August and the beginning of September. According to Ni's charges, he abused the freedom of the clergy and violated the so-called "rebellious law." Regarding the foreign newspapers' report that the churchgoers of Ni Müller's church in Dalen, a suburb of Berlin, were arrested yesterday, according to well-informed sources, it was a false report that about one hundred people who conspired to demonstrate there were listed by the police authorities. (National Haitian News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] A demonstration recently took place in Luxembourg's Dahlem area, petitioning for the arrested clergymen. Seventy-five men and forty women were arrested by the secret police in the city today. It has been found that there are already sixty-four German clergymen who have been detained for violating church regulations. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in Qingdao Conduct Armed Patrols in the City at Night</h3>
<p>General Citizens Feel Extremely Uneasy; Municipal Government Protests to Japan</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the outbreak of the Tianjin and Beijing battles, the situation has become increasingly tense. Qingdao, due to its special circumstances, is full of rumors and is startled several times a night. Many citizens have been moving to other ports in recent days. Fortunately, the municipal authorities have tried their best to appease the people, and the people's hearts have calmed down slightly. Unexpectedly, at this time of crisis, the Japanese have again used the excuse of protecting overseas Chinese, and have specially organized a night patrol team by the Japanese Consulate in Qingdao, together with the military and naval attachés stationed in Qingdao and the resident corps. From 8 pm on the 6th to 5 am on the 7th, they patrolled the streets. The Japanese Police Chief Shirakami served as the commander-in-chief. The patrol team's office was located in the resident corps' patrol area, which included the three districts in the city and the Si Cang district, a total of four districts. A total of seven cars patrolled the city, and two cars patrolled the Si Cang district. When they set off, the cars were full of armed militia, and the headlights on the front of the cars were particularly bright. The sound of the cars was incessant on the road. Most of the citizens were unaware of it beforehand. When the cars passed through the streets, they mistakenly thought that an incident had occurred and rushed to close their doors and take refuge. The police bureau on our side had received a report in advance and specially ordered each sub-bureau to be on high alert to prevent accidents. After each sub-bureau received the order, in addition to sending patrol teams to patrol around, they also sent police to guard at each important intersection. Fortunately, due to our strict precautions, everything was safe. The municipal government protested strongly to the Japanese consulate in writing on the 7th because the Japanese side had arbitrarily sent patrol teams to patrol the city, which not only disturbed the city but also encroached on our country's police power, and demanded that the Japanese consulate inform the Japanese naval and army attachés stationed in Qingdao and the resident corps that such illegal actions should not be repeated in the future. However, since the 7th, the number of passengers at each pier and station has increased several times compared to the previous two days. (7th)</p>
<h3>Sad Horns Blow Across Chaoshan Waves</h3>
<p>Angry Waves Roll in Nan'ao; Chaotic Mountains Swallow the Setting Sun</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese overseas Chinese in Chaoshan have returned to their country one after another. The last batch of 86 people also went to Taiwan on the Hong Kong Maru on the 2nd. They have listed the goods, furniture, etc. they left behind and registered them with the Japanese Consulate in Shantou. However, they did not return the rented shops to the landlords, probably with the intention of making a comeback. Therefore, when they left, they released all kinds of rumors, saying that the Taiwan naval and air forces were ready to mobilize and punish the illegal anti-Japanese Chinese army, and that Chaoshan would soon be a continuation of Tianjin and Beijing. The ignorant people mistakenly believed the rumors, and were frightened by each other, causing a situation where they were in constant fear. Japanese Consul Seiichi Yamazaki went to the Chunfeng warship every day at 2 pm to work, and returned to the consulate ashore at about 8 am the next morning to speak to the registered people gathered in the consulate and report on various situations. The consulate was presided over by Japanese Police Chief Kiyomi Ide, who guided the activities of the registered people. These people all have special tasks and will not leave the country for the time being.</p>
<p>At present, the people in Shantou are panicked and are fleeing to Hong Kong or moving to the mainland. Tickets for Hong Kong ships are sold out three days in advance. Each ship often carries more than 1,700 passengers, more than twice the usual number. There is no room to move in the cabins. Those who move their families to the mainland are even more crowded. Rickshaws, trucks, and porters are all making a hundred times more profit. Pedestrians on the road never stop all night, and they are all pouring into the mainland. The Chaoshan Railway has added open freight cars to carry passengers back to Chao'an, running ten times a day, all full of passengers. Luggage is piled up like a mountain in the train station. Some people stay at the station to wait for the train. Ships and docks to Chaoyang and Jieyang are also crowded with people. Those who get on the ships compete to be first, for fear of being left behind. Various ships add two or three civilian ships, and they leave as soon as they arrive, regardless of day or night. Passengers sit under the scorching sun without feeling bitter. These scenes are truly unbearable.</p>
<p>The bank doors are full of people withdrawing their savings. Fortunately, each bank has sufficient reserves, so there are no restrictions on withdrawals. Several million yuan have been withdrawn from the postal savings department in recent days, and withdrawals can be made as soon as you arrive. Central legal tender is issued, and commercial bank notes are no longer issued. The municipal government has also issued a notice advising the people to remain calm, not to believe rumors, and not to disturb each other. However, the people are still unable to calm down for the time being.</p>
<p>The Japanese warships berthed in Shantou have no intention of leaving. According to imported fishing boats from overseas, the Japanese warships No. 5, No. 7, No. 13, and No. 15 often cruise along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong. Japanese fishermen also follow closely in teams. They always stop for several hours between Nan'ao, Zhao'an, Wuyu, and the Brother Islands. The people of Chaoshan pay close attention to the safety of Nan'ao, because although the island is isolated overseas, it is actually a barrier for the provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, and it is also related to the national fortunes of the countries in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Two Sailing Boats Capsized in Hurricane Off Qingdao</h3>
<p>Passengers Sacrificed to the Winds En Route After Leaving Qingdao to Seek Refuge</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Due to the tense situation in Hebei, a large number of people have been leaving Qingdao in recent days, especially on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of this month. In addition to those taking the Jiaoji Railway west, the passenger ships and sailing boats leaving the docks of Xiaogang and Dagang were extremely crowded. On the evening of the 2nd, seven sailing boats departed from Xiaogang Dock for the Tuowan area southwest of Shijiusuo, all fully loaded with male and female passengers (approximately 130 people per boat). The journey was uneventful that night. However, on the morning of the 3rd, as they were en route, they encountered a hurricane. There was no shelter along the way, and they were forced to drift with the wind, which grew fiercer. The waves at sea surged skyward. The seven sailing boats were in extreme danger, and the passengers on board had no way to call for help. By the afternoon of the 5th, only five boats had managed to struggle to Zhu Pengkou. The other two boats completely capsized, and all passengers were killed. By the morning of the 6th, more than twenty bodies of men, women, and children had washed ashore in the Tuowan coastal area, a tragic scene. According to investigations, most of the passengers who perished were engaged in small businesses in Qi and were leaving to seek refuge, only to meet their end. Furthermore, the two small steamships, Yuan Tai and Qing Xing, which departed for Shijiusuo on the same day, were also fully loaded with male and female passengers and encountered danger en route. Fortunately, being steamships, they were able to withstand the conditions. They sailed to Yuntai Mountain near Lianyungang that evening to take shelter and thus escaped danger. However, the Qing Xing steamship, due to the even greater number of passengers, experienced five passenger deaths from heat exhaustion. After the wind subsided, it finally sailed to Shijiusuo. Following an investigation, the military authorities there, considering that the ship had disregarded the hurricane and recklessly set sail, treating human life as a trifle, detained the ship and prohibited it from departing.</p>
<h3>People's Embankment on the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River in Shandong Province Breached</h3>
<p>The Northern Bank's Main Dyke is in Extreme Danger; Threatens to Flood Southern Hebei and Directly Inundate Tianjin</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The Yellow River has been a source of disasters for years, causing severe local losses. This year, the provincial authorities ordered counties along the river to heighten and reinforce the main dykes, fully believing that they would be safe. Unexpectedly, the river water surged sharply in early summer, bringing the flood season forward by a month. Thereafter, it receded and rose repeatedly, exceeding last year's highest record on several occasions. Personnel from the Flood Prevention Bureau and local laborers along the river have been diligently patrolling the dikes day and night. A few days ago, the Baitang small people's embankment on the northern bank of the middle reaches was the first to be overtopped and breached. The Flood Prevention Bureau telegraphed the counties on the northern bank to strengthen their defenses. However, the water volume was too great, and on the 7th, the Da Min embankment was also breached, with three breaches, 400 meters wide, losing 20% of its capacity. The water leaking out now flows between the Da Min embankment and the Jin Dyke (i.e., the northern bank's main dyke), splitting into two streams. One stream flows westward, reversing and overflowing, while the other flows eastward, re-entering the main river. The Jin Dyke has not seen water for several years and is now in extreme danger. If another accident occurs, the Yellow River water could flow north into southern Hebei and potentially flood west of the Jinpu Railway line, directly inundating Tianjin. In addition, the Wulongtan people's embankment in Changqing experienced two breaches on the 8th. Although they have been blocked, there is still a risk. Jinan may face the lament of being "a fish." On the 8th, the water level at Lishengtun upstream was 59.05 meters, only one centimeter below the water level during the Dongzhuang breach in the 24th year. The water level at Luokou was 31.77 meters, also exceeding last year's highest water level by 5.6 centimeters. Bu Kairu, director of the Flood Prevention Bureau, has been supervising work at Guanzhuang, and Han Fuqu, chairman of the Shandong provincial government, has also gone to Luokou to inspect and guide the defense. The telegram from the Flood Prevention Bureau to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission and the provincial government reporting the breach is recorded below: "We have reported by telegram the situation of the Wangji and Wangzhuang people's embankments in Shouyang County being overtopped and the direction of the water flow. We now report the process of the Da Min embankment breach based on the telegram report from Bian Chongxiu, chief of the upstream section, which states that the northern bank's people's embankment extends from Huangying in Fan County to Liuqiao in Shouzhang. There is a small people's embankment in front of the embankment. The Baitang breach was this embankment. The Baitang breach is about one kilometer wide. The water enters the area between the Da Min and Xiao Min embankments, flowing down to the lower end of the Xiao Min embankment, causing a blockage. Although five openings were dug above Wang Heizhuang, the water flow is still difficult to discharge and continues to rise, causing the Da Min embankment to have only 4-5 centimeters of water, which is eroded by the wind and waves, causing the embankment body to sink severely and making rescue difficult, leading to overtopping and breach. The Da Min embankment has a total of three breaches: one in Wangji within the border of Shouzhang, one in Liuqiao within the border of Shoujing, and one in Wangzhuang within the border of Fan County. The Wangji breach is about 100 meters wide and about 5-6 meters deep. The Liuqiao breach is about 80 meters wide and about 5-6 meters deep. The combined length of the two breaches is about 400 meters, losing more than 20% of its capacity. However, the scouring at the breach is very rapid, and the expansion is fast. The embankment root of the northern bank's main dyke has already seen water. The reversing flow has reached Nanguan in Fan County. According to the telegram report from Xu Gongtian, chief of the North First Subdivision, the water from the overtopping at Ganji and other places has now converged with the Jin Dyke and the Jia River to Shangtai in Shouzhang and has split into a westward flow, reaching above the Daokou defense First Battalion. Nanguan, Jiloufangzipu, and Zhulou in Fan County are close to the embankment root, with water depths varying from 3-4 centimeters. From the Zilu Dyke, Jindouying, Lianhuachi, Miaotai to the Shouzhang moat dyke, the embankment root has a water depth of 6-7 centimeters to 1 meter. The eastward flow still enters the main river. From Dongzhifang to Baoying dyke root in Shouzhang, the water depth varies from 1 meter to 1.45 meters. A 3-meter long crack has appeared at the Guajiantai embankment. Instructions have been given to build a solid embankment. In addition to sending a telegram to the chief of the general sub-division to supervise the strict defense of the northern bank's main dyke to ensure its safety, this telegram is submitted for your information."</p>
<h3>The Supervisory Office of Huguang Impeaches Officials in Hubei Province for Corruption in Dyke Repair</h3>
<p>The Supervisory Yuan Orders Transfer for Disciplinary Action and Refers the Case to the Court for Strict Handling According to Law</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: The people of Jianghan, Hubei Province, regard the dykes as their lifeline. However, like in years of poor harvests, the dykes collapse every year despite repairs. The government wastes public funds, and the people still lament. The reason is that the officials in charge engage in corruption and embezzlement, and cut corners. Gao Yihan, the Huguang Supervisory Commissioner, attaches great importance to cases of corruption in dyke repair. Previously, the people of Qianjiang County, Xiong Zhenghua, and others, filed a lawsuit against Li Jiang, director of the Seventh Works Office of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, Wu Dian, section chief of the office and concurrently the member of the dyke survey committee of the Third District of Qianjiang County, and Wang Xianbai and Huang Kongshan, joint guarantors of Huangshe and Wangfu townships in the Third District of Qianjiang County, for perfunctory work on the dykes and two instances of embezzlement. The case was accepted, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau was requested to investigate and reply, and then to send personnel for a reinvestigation. It was found that the officials had indeed reduced the amount of earthwork, deducted the square price, and assisted in corruption. Therefore, the commissioner submitted an impeachment to the Supervisory Yuan, arguing that Wang Xianbai and Huang Kongshan, as joint guarantee directors, bore the responsibility of contractors, which was a behavior related to their public official duties. Their reduction of earthwork and deduction of square prices constituted a violation of law and crime, which was not comparable to contractors of other ordinary projects. Li Jiang and Wu Dian had obvious failures in their duties as supervisors of the project and were also suspected of colluding in corruption. Dyke construction is related to the country's finances and the people's lives, and these officials had significant responsibilities. However, such behaviors were discovered, and regardless of the severity of the circumstances, they should be punished according to the law. Therefore, it was proposed to impeach them and immediately transfer them for disciplinary action. The criminal part of the case involving Wang Xianbai and Huang Kongshan should be transferred to the competent court for handling. If the court's investigation confirms that Li Jiang and Wu Dian colluded in corruption and obtained illicit gains, their criminal part should also be handed over to the court for legal handling. After receiving the report, the Supervisory Yuan handed it over to Supervisory Commissioners Li Zonghuang, Hu Boyue, and Bai Rui for review. They determined that Wang Xianbai and Huang Kongshan had cut corners and reduced materials, and that Li Jiang and Wu Dian had violated the law and failed to perform their duties, and they should be transferred for disciplinary action. Director Yu of the Yuan, based on the review report from Li and others, has ordered the Huguang Supervisory Office to transfer the four offenders for disciplinary action. The criminal part of the case has also been transferred to the court for legal handling. (8th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Provincial Government Strictly Prevents the Enemy from Purchasing Cattle</h3>
<p>Recently, Shandong, Henan, and Jiangsu Have Been Searched and Purchased Empty; Transported to Qingdao for Slaughter and Then Transshipped for Export</p>
<p>Wuhu Dispatch: The Anhui Provincial Government recently issued orders to the county governments and the police bureaus of Wuhu, Bengbu, Datong, etc., to strictly prevent the enemy from using cattle merchants to purchase cattle at high prices. They must especially pay close attention to and prohibit the export of culled cattle from northern Anhui. The initial discovery of this matter was made by the Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association. The source of cattle in Shanghai has always been mainly from Shandong, Anhui, Henan, and northern Jiangsu. Due to customs regulations restricting the export of these cattle, the annual sales volume is a fixed number, so it does not hinder agriculture or people's food supply. In the past month, cattle and sheep businesses have been buying cattle everywhere, resulting in no cattle to buy, leading to a disruption of supply and soaring prices, causing widespread panic. After a detailed investigation by the industry association, it was learned that the enemy was buying cattle in large quantities in Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and northern Jiangsu at high prices, transporting them to Qingdao for large-scale slaughter, and shipping them out for military use. Some cattle merchants, caring only for their own interests, have been diligently searching and providing supplies, even to the extent that the Jinan Municipal Shandong Provincial Cattle Permit Administration requires a ten-yuan export permit tax for all cattle exported, openly allowing the trade. As a result, the number of cattle transported to Shanghai has suddenly disappeared, causing panic in the supply of beef. The industry association believes that this unlimited behavior harms our country's agriculture and people's food supply and is not a trivial matter. They have submitted a report to the Ministry of Industry requesting a solution. After receiving the report, the Ministry referred it to the governments of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui, ordering them to strictly investigate and prohibit the activity.</p>

<p>Another Traitor Arrested at the Railway Station</p>
<p>Wuyi has been arresting many suspected traitors for days, who are being interrogated and sent for prosecution. However, at around 7 PM on the 7th, Liu Qinglin, a soldier of the Security Team, was patrolling the Changzhou Station on the Beijing-Shanghai National Railway when he noticed a man wearing a yellow turn-down collar shirt and white shorts, looking around, lingering and not leaving. His behavior was very suspicious, and he was interrogated. He stammered and could not answer. Therefore, he was taken to Sun Huashan, the captain of the Fourth Squad, for questioning. He confessed his name was Tan Xuejun, 20 years old, from Haizhou. He had worked for a Japanese company and had recently been under the command of Gao Qingxuan, a Chinese national of the so-called Japanese General Organ, and had begun to act as a traitor. There were more than ten others in his group, specializing in scouting military information on the Beijing-Shanghai line. He had come to Changzhou from Nanxiang, and so on. A silk handkerchief with a red sun-shaped mark was found on him, as well as a Japanese letter made from a Platinum Dragon cigarette case. After the captain finished questioning him, he submitted the case to the county government on the 8th for transfer to the garrison headquarters for strict handling.</p>

<p>Xu Hongjun, a native of Shandong, had previously been driven by a certain party to act as a traitor, going to Lianyungang to spy on military intelligence. He was captured by the garrison troops and sent to the Garrison Headquarters of the Eastern Section of the Longhai Railway. After repeated interrogations, the suspect confessed that he was a traitor, spying on military intelligence in various places for a certain party, and did not deny it. The Garrison Headquarters tied the suspect to the execution ground on the morning of the 5th and carried out the execution by firing squad. The spectators applauded and cheered.</p>

<p>Detaining Rice Grain Being Smuggled Out</p>
<p>The county's rice grain is insufficient for self-sufficiency, and more than half is supplied by neighboring counties such as Changshu and Kunshan. The current situation is tense, and there are few rice boats. For the sake of preparedness, the county government recently convened local leaders and decided to prohibit the export of rice grain. Police were dispatched to guard the main land and water routes. In recent days, rice and grain boats have been intercepted at Hengli River on the Xihu Road near Nanxiang, totaling 500 stones, all of which were detained.</p>

<h3>Japanese Officer Armed and Drove Straight into Our Airfield</h3>
<p>First Opening Fire and Killing Our Security Team Soldiers; Security Team Retaliated, Killing the Japanese Officer and Soldiers; Negotiations Resulted in Both Sides Agreeing to a Diplomatic Solution</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, Captain Oyama Isamu, a lieutenant in the First Company of the Japanese Marine Corps, along with a Class A sailor, Saito Yoso, as the driver, drove their military vehicle to our Hongqiao Airfield and charged straight into the airfield's security line. At the same time, the officer opened fire with live ammunition on the soldiers of our special service company stationed at the field. The soldiers in the field lay down to avoid the gunfire, and the Japanese officer drove the car at full speed towards the north, continuing to fire, indiscriminately firing at our nearby security team, killing one of our soldiers. At this point, our security team was forced to return fire, resulting in the death of the Japanese officer and a Class A sailor on the spot. After the incident, our authorities, considering that the behavior of the Japanese officer was inappropriate, made a serious protest to the Japanese side. The details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Charged into the Airfield, Harming Our Security Team</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, two Japanese men in Japanese naval officer uniforms and carrying weapons went to Hongqiao Airfield in a car. Upon arrival, they attempted to charge into the field. Our airfield guards stopped them. It has been noted that in recent days, Japanese have frequently come to the airfield to spy. Our military and police authorities have strictly ordered the airfield guards not to return fire in case of disturbances by a small number of Japanese. Therefore, when the airfield guards saw the Japanese firing, they lay down and ducked for cover, without returning fire. The Japanese then turned back in the original car. At that time, our nearby security team, hearing the gunfire, went out on patrol. The Japanese opened fire again, killing one of our security team members. They then retaliated, killing one person on the spot, and another person was also hit, and died ten steps away due to serious injuries.</p>
<p>Mayor Yu Inquired by Telephone, but the Japanese Side Initially Did Not Believe It</p>
<p>After Mayor Yu received the report of the incident at Hongqiao Airfield, he immediately inquired with Okamoto, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, by telephone. At the same time, Zhou Jue, a secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also spoke with Honda, the Japanese naval attaché, to inquire. Okamoto and Honda initially did not believe the incident, stating that no Japanese Marine Corps officers or soldiers had been ordered to go out today, and even if someone went out, they would never go to Hongqiao Airfield, as Japanese officers and soldiers should absolutely not go there.</p>
<p>Negotiations Resulted in a Decision to Resolve the Matter Diplomatically</p>
<p>Mayor Yu went to the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai at 8 PM to negotiate. The Japanese side participating included Consul General Okamoto, Consul Tajiri, Naval Attachés Honda and Okino, and others. Mayor Yu first described the events of the day and said that the incident was indeed unfortunate. However, the Municipal Government had previously lodged written protests about the Japanese naval officers and sailors repeatedly spying at Hongqiao Airfield and clashing with the guards, and requested them to stop in order to avoid accidental disputes. Today, an unfortunate incident occurred again due to Japanese soldiers spying at the airfield, which is deeply regrettable. According to the accurate report obtained by our side, two Japanese naval soldiers came to Hongqiao Airfield in a car at 5:30 PM this afternoon, charged through the security line, refused to stop when our side tried to stop them, and suddenly opened fire. The guards of our airfield did not return fire because they had been ordered not to do so. The soldiers then turned back, and our nearby security team, hearing the gunfire, went out on patrol. The soldiers opened fire again, killing one of our soldiers. Our security team then retaliated. As for the detailed situation, it is still under investigation. In addition to the death of one security team member, it is also to be investigated whether there were any other deaths or injuries. However, there is no doubt that the unfortunate incident was caused by the Japanese sailors disregarding previous protests and opening fire on our airfield guards and security team. However, at a time when the situation in North China is serious, your side and our side have been working together to maintain the security of this city and prevent incidents from happening. Although this unfortunate incident has occurred, we still hope that your side will remain calm and do your best not to escalate the situation. On the one hand, both sides should investigate and seek a satisfactory solution through diplomatic channels. After a long discussion, the Japanese side agreed to resolve the case through diplomatic means.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side Claimed the Bodies of the Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>After Mayor Yu left the Japanese Consulate General, the Japanese Consul General, the Japanese Naval Attaché Office, the Marine Corps Headquarters, and Japanese reporters, accompanied by Zhang Tingrong, secretary of our municipal government, Zhu Xia, chief of staff of the garrison headquarters, and representatives from the police bureau and the Public Works Department, went to the scene of the incident to investigate and claimed the bodies of the Japanese officers killed. It was determined that one of the deceased was Lieutenant Oyama Isamu and the other was Saito Yoso.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Decides to Stay in Shanghai Temporarily</h3>
<p>Nikko Still Remains in the Capital The Japanese Ambassador to China, Kawagoe Shigeru, arrived in Shanghai on the 7th, taking the route from Tianjin via Dalian. He has been meeting with subordinates and listening to reports for days. He has currently decided to stay in Shanghai temporarily to observe the development of the situation and is not preparing to go to Beijing. The rumor that Kawagoe will go to Beijing on the 10th is definitely not true. According to Shimizu, a counselor at the Japanese Embassy, Ambassador Kawagoe is currently not preparing to go to Beijing, and the rumor that he will go to Beijing on the 10th is not accurate. Consul General Nikko is still in Beijing and has not come to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Yang's Address</p>
<p>Oath Supervisor Yang Hu gave an address, stating that Mayor Yu was taking the oath of office, and he was representing the central government to supervise the oath. Mayor Yu had been managing Shanghai affairs for many years and was very familiar with the situation in Shanghai. In the past, Mayor Yu's hard work, diligence, and devotion to his duties had been highly praised.

<p>Oath</p>
<p>Mayor Yu's oath read: "I solemnly swear that I will abide by the Prime Minister's will, obey the party's principles, abide by the laws, and dedicate my loyalty and efforts to my duties.

<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Decides to Send Ships to Bring Back Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Orders the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Allocate Six Ships; Will Depart After Notifying the Japanese Side</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a large influx of students returning from Japan. There are still many people in Japan who have not yet left because they cannot buy ship tickets and cannot make the trip. They are now trying to take other countries' ships back to Shanghai. Yesterday, Yu Hongchuan, Tingmei, Huang Jiaxian, Shen Xi, Xie Gang, Chuan Tongde, Ye Shuchang, and others, totaling 86 students, arrived in Shanghai on a Japanese ship. Li Kezhen, Huang Jinshun, Liu Tingjie, and other overseas Chinese in Japan, totaling 140 people, also arrived. Overseas Chinese in Japan are eagerly hoping that the government will send ships to pick them up. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the number of overseas Chinese is no less than 5,000, and for the sake of safe arrangements, it has previously telegraphed all overseas Chinese to gather at the coastal ports and wait for ships to pick them up and escort them back to China. It is now known that after discussions between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee, a decision has been made to request the Ministry of Communications to order the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to allocate six special ships to sail to Japan to bring back all the overseas Chinese students. At that time, representatives from various ministries and commissions will be added to take care of the overseas Chinese. Once the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issues a formal note to notify the Japanese government to assist, the ships will depart within days. The Ministry of Education is also extremely concerned about the safety of our students in Japan and has drafted follow-up measures and urged Chen Cipu to return to Japan to take charge and handle the matter nearby. After receiving the order, Chen left this morning (9th) at 8:00 AM on the Japanese Queen ship of the Changxing Company to travel east.</p>

<h3>Ten Japanese Ships Carrying 2,000 Marines Arrive in Shanghai via Yangtze River</h3>
<p>Accompanying 2,000 Japanese Residents Evacuating Eastward, High-Ranking Officers Reinforce the Third Fleet</p>
<p>All Japanese residents along the Yangtze River have been evacuated. The Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy, stationed in the Yangtze River of our country, including all warships of the Eleventh Squadron, which were formerly stationed in Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, Hankou, and various ports upstream, has now received orders for the entire squadron to withdraw. The flagship of the Eleventh Squadron, the Anyu, has already transported a large quantity of military equipment and marines to Shanghai from Hankou. Yesterday, ships continued to arrive in Shanghai from Hankou, Xunyang, Wuhu, and Nanjing. These included the Hira, Atami, Toba, Hozu, Seta, Fushimi, Kuri, Yaeyama, Ren, and Kataka, a total of ten ships, fully loaded with a large amount of military supplies and over 2,000 marines evacuated from various places along the Yangtze River. Approximately 2,000 Japanese residents evacuated from Hankou, Xunyang, Anhui, Wuhu, and Nanjing were also aboard, distributed among ships like the Xiangyang Maru, and arrived in Shanghai. One of these ten ships arrived yesterday morning, followed by seven more in the afternoon. After entering the port, they were berthed in the Yangshupu area. The marines disembarked and joined the Shanghai garrison to strengthen their forces, under the command of Commander Okawa. It is also reported that due to the tense situation, the Japanese Ministry of the Navy has dispatched high-ranking officers Nakamura Katsutsune, Navy Lieutenant Commander Asahi Tatsuo, Navy Lieutenant Okuda Kaneichi, and Iida Mitsuteru to the Third Fleet in Shanghai to take on important tasks such as military command and staff duties.

<h3>Zhu Xuefan Returns to China Yesterday</h3>
<p>Countries Express Sympathy, Anti-Japanese Sentiment Prevails in Europe and America. Zhu Xuefan, the labor representative from our country attending the World Textile Conference and the 12th International Labor Conference, embarked from Marseille on the French postal ship Athos after the conference and returned to China. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. Various labor unions and relatives of Zhu Xuefan in the city welcomed him at the port. According to Zhu Xuefan's remarks to a Dagongbao reporter on the ship, there is no need to elaborate on the situations of the International Labor Conference and the World Textile Conference. During his return trip, he learned from radio reports about the outbreak of the incident, the successive fall of Peiping and Tianjin, and the arrival of the national crisis at its most serious stage. He expressed his unbearable grief and indignation upon returning to his homeland today. He mentioned that during his mission to attend the International Labor Conference, he had extensive contact with labor representatives from countries such as England, the United States, France, and Germany. He provided detailed information about Japan's aggression against China, and all countries expressed deep sympathy for our country. In recent years, due to the development of its industry, Japan's economic power has gradually expanded to Europe and America, affecting the laborers of various countries, who therefore do not show goodwill towards Japan. In particular, anti-Japanese sentiment is very strong in the United States. At this final juncture for our country, we should not only unite nationwide, align our steps, and resist the war uniformly, but also should not neglect international relations. If our country can make the greatest effort to appeal to the international community for justice, it will surely win the sympathy of various countries and prompt them to impose effective economic sanctions on the aggressor. Zhu Xuefan concluded by saying that after reporting to the Party and government authorities in Shanghai, he will travel to Nanjing within days to report on the conference proceedings to the central government.</p>

<h3>Five Groups Jointly Urge Cooperation Between Labor and Management in All Industries</h3>
<p>Jointly Maintain the Production of Key Industries, Stockpile Supplies for War Use for the Country</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Industrial Federation, the Joint Association of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, the Shanghai National Goods Factories Association, and the Shanghai General Labor Union jointly issued a letter to labor and management in all industries stating that the Lugouqiao Incident has broken out suddenly, Peiping and Tianjin have fallen, and the entire country is facing its final juncture. If we want to save the country and ensure its survival, we must launch a comprehensive war of resistance. The so-called comprehensive war of resistance is a war of resistance involving the entire national strength, that is, a war of resistance that concentrates the military, material, financial, and human resources of the entire country. The life and death of our Chinese nation will depend on the success or failure of this effort. At this moment, as the prelude to the great war is about to begin, we deeply hope that the capital side of all factories and the workers of all industries will, in the spirit of labor-management cooperation, devote themselves to hard work and continue to maintain the production of key industries, so that there will be no shortage of supplies for the war and the rear area supply can be enriched. At the same time, we should try our best to economize on material and financial resources and stockpile them for the country's use to increase the strength to resist aggression and defend against insults. Only then can we hope for final victory. We sincerely offer this advice, and we hope you will consider it.</p>

<h3>A Large Quantity of Coal is Transported from Qingdao to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Totaling More Than 25,000 Tons</p>
<p>Most of the coal in this city is supplied by provinces in North China. Due to the gradual decrease in inventory, the selling price has been rising. It has been learned that a large batch of coal recently shipped from Qingdao to Shanghai was loaded onto the Huasheng, Huashun, Hexing, Tianxing, Pingji, Beijin, Shen'ai, Shenhua, and other ships, totaling approximately 25,000 tons. They were delayed en route due to being hit by a hurricane. Now, they have arrived at the port one after another, and many passengers have also boarded the ships from Qingdao to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Gan Jiehou Discusses the Expansion of the War of Resistance and Our Inevitable Victory</h3>
<p>Japanese Subjects Have Never Agreed with the Warlords; Their Ambition in Invading China Lies in Eliminating British and Russian Influence; National Resistance Will Surely Achieve Final Victory</p>
<p>Mr. Gan Jiehou, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the same ship as Zou Lu and Cai Tingkai. That evening, he met with Mr. Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission. He traveled to Nanjing by train yesterday morning (the 9th). Before his departure, Mr. Gan delivered a speech in which he analyzed the future of the Sino-Japanese War and the international situation in great detail. The following is a record of his remarks:</p>
<p>Two months ago, when I met with a certain leader of the Central Government in Shanghai, I offered the following opinion: "Our enemy is the Japanese military, not the Japanese people. If the influential figures in political parties, important officials, the diplomatic corps, financial groups, and capitalists can rise to the occasion and advocate adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, thereby stopping the reckless plans of the military; and if Germany and Italy, who have close ties with Japan, can advise Japan, out of friendship with our country, not to disrupt peace in East Asia, then we can leverage the sympathy of the United States and Britain, as well as utilize these two powers to protect our territory and extend the period of military preparation. This would be the best course of action. However, I fear that the Japanese military will not abandon its original plan and will be difficult to bring to heel. If the military once again suppresses the political parties, or if the political parties soften and agree with the military, then our last hope will be dashed. We will have no other path but resistance. We do not need to win, only to expand and sustain the war. The Japanese military will inevitably collapse, and we can eliminate future troubles forever." Now that the war has begun, please allow me to reiterate my previous intention and offer my humble opinion on the decisions that our country should adopt:</p>
<p>㊀ National Resistance Will Surely Achieve Final Victory</p>
<p>Japan benefits from a swift and decisive war, while we benefit from prolonged endurance. Japan benefits from narrowing the area of combat, while we benefit from expanding the front lines. Japan benefits from a decisive battle between the main forces of both countries, while we benefit from distributing our military strength and resisting everywhere. Therefore, by launching national resistance and prolonging the war for more than half a year, Japan will inevitably become unsustainable. Final victory will surely belong to us. Let me explain the reasons: ㊀ From the perspective of the interests of the Japanese military, after the Battle of Shanghai, the Japanese people gradually began to complain about the military. Now, the military wants to repeat the old trick of occupying the three northeastern provinces, provoking incidents, threatening to withdraw troops, and staging three acts of puppet organization, hoping to easily seize North China. They also want to flaunt their martial achievements to restore the people's faith. Now, because of our determination to resist, their plan has failed. Therefore, the military is eager to win a battle quickly and exaggerate its miraculous achievements to deceive its people. Thus, their strategy involves using aircraft and heavy weapons to launch a fierce attack on our main forces, as well as our political, economic, and transportation centers, in a short period of time, to force us to submit. However, if the Japanese army not only fails to win quickly but suffers a defeat, the military's credibility will plummet. Even if they do not suffer a defeat, but the war drags on for a long time, exhausting the people and wasting money, public grievances will inevitably arise, leading to political changes. The internal disputes in Japan are not only matters between political parties, important officials, financial groups, capitalists, and the military, but also involve a struggle between the moderate and radical factions within the military. If the military wins this invasion of China, it will inevitably seize power and change the political organization. Domestic political groups and moderate military personnel who do not want to be controlled by them will all be eliminated. Currently, political parties that support the military's policies seem to be intimidated by its power and have no choice but to do so in order to survive. Once the military's failed policies are fully exposed, the people will realize they have been deceived, and domestic disputes will inevitably intensify. The military will be unable to sustain itself. The collapse of the military will end the war, and final victory will surely belong to us. ㊁ From the perspective of Japan's national stance, Japan's purpose in invading China is to eliminate British and Russian influence in China and then use our country's human and material resources to strengthen its military, gradually driving British and Russian forces out of Asia and becoming the master of Asia. Therefore, Japan's strategy is aimed at Britain and Russia, with China being one step in its progress. Only in this way can Japan's invasion of China not deplete its strength, and it must obtain a complete China, not a fragmented one. If China is fragmented, it will be useless to obtain it. If Japan depletes its strength, then even if it obtains China, it will weaken itself and be unable to eliminate British and Russian influence. The three countries of Britain, the United States, and Russia will act like the three countries of Germany, France, and Russia after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, jointly intervene and forcibly dispose of its war spoils. Moreover, if the war drags on for a long time, the risks that Japan faces are not limited to this. The Soviet Union's Far East garrison can threaten Manchukuo at any time, and its air force can even threaten Tokyo. Although the Soviet Union is currently plagued by party purges and is in a state of chaos, with Stalin focusing on purging the party and perhaps temporarily unable to look eastward, this is only a temporary phenomenon. After the start of the Sino-Japanese War, if the Soviet Union completes its internal rectification and uses its land and air forces to strike the Japanese army in the back in the three northeastern provinces, and also attacks Tokyo with its air force while the Japanese army is bombing China, Japan does not have many air forces that can fight and will definitely be unable to attend to both sides. May I ask, how can Japan be sure of victory? In addition, Britain's passive observation of Japan's rampant behavior, with no way to stop it, is due to insufficient naval power and naval bases too far from Japan to control it. Now, Britain is making every effort to expand its military, and the purpose of its naval plan is to control a certain country in Europe and simultaneously control Japan in the Far East. If this plan is completed, Japan's position will be extremely precarious. Now that the Sino-Japanese war has just begun, the Japanese House of Representatives has already added a budget of 419.6 million yuan. If our national resistance lasts for a year, the funds required by Japan will be more than ten times this amount. At that time, Japan's financial resources will be exhausted. What surplus funds will it have to expand its naval and air forces? From then on, the ratio of British and Japanese naval and air forces will become increasingly disparate. How can Japan still be allowed to look around and act arrogantly in the Pacific? How can the Japanese authorities not know about the above three crises? If they know it and still make a desperate gamble, then we will prepare to perish together with them, otherwise victory will surely belong to us. ㊂ From the perspective of the Japanese military's combat capability, although the Japanese military is well-trained and has sophisticated equipment, (1) the outcome of a war is greatly related to the soldiers' combat experience. Since the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese soldiers have had virtually no combat experience. Our country, on the other hand, has had years of civil war, and soldiers who have fought against the communists and bandits have experienced dozens of battles. Their experience is naturally rich. Their courage, skills, and calmness in combat will inevitably be superior to those of Japanese soldiers. (2) In the past, the Russo-Japanese War was about the survival of the Japanese nation. Now, the reason is without merit, and the morale is naturally different. Moreover, Japanese soldiers all come from the people and have parents, wives, children, property, and careers. In recent years, their living standards have improved, and they have become accustomed to comfort. It is not their wish to sacrifice themselves on the front lines. Chinese soldiers, on the other hand, live a hard life, and most of them have no family burden. They all know that the survival of our country and nation depends on the success of the war of resistance. Their bravery and spirit of sacrifice have already been demonstrated in the battles of Shanghai, the Great Wall, Suiyuan, and the Pingjin Line. The Japanese army relies entirely on heavy artillery and aircraft for its own protection and to create advantages. If our combat area and methods reduce the effectiveness of its heavy weapons, then Japan's combat power will be far inferior to that of our country's army. Therefore, even if Japan has no internal or external worries, and our country has no foreign aid, judging solely on combat capability, final victory will surely belong to us.</p>
<p>㊁ Seeking Peace at This Time in the Hope of Survival Will Only Lead to Death</p>
<p>A certain country, unwilling for war to break out in the Far East, strongly urges both sides to lay down their arms. The Japanese ambassador, Kawagoe, although his attitude is quite ambiguous, is quite keen on seeking peace. From the perspective of that country, this is indeed the step it should take, because the outbreak of war between China and Japan will inevitably harm the interests of all countries in the Far East, and the evolution of the war may even affect world peace. That country is in a bad environment and finds it difficult to cope with this extraordinary situation. The advice of that country to our country is also out of good intentions, because China's strength is insufficient, and it is better to endure and prepare for the future recovery than to lose more territory in defeat. From Japan's point of view, if it can seize Pingjin and have its accomplished fait accompli acknowledged, there would be no harm in stopping there. Japan's invasion of China is based on the policy of nibbling. At every juncture, it creates incidents, puts forward conditions, and demands matters of local nature, which must be resolved with the local authorities. Then, it threatens surrender and turns them into puppets. If they do not surrender, it uses force to remove these obstacles and then seeks peace. In this way, it gradually invades southward with a small force. First, it controls Wanping, then Lu and Jin. Soon, all the land north of the Longhai Railway will be estimated to be occupied, and then it will proclaim Sino-Japanese friendship and want our country to adjust relations, take a short rest, and then plan for the Yangtze River. This time, when the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, the Central Government immediately dispatched troops north to prepare for resistance. Its policy of nibbling thus failed. The Japanese military thought that those who went north to fight were only a part of the Chinese army and that it was still a local war. Therefore, it wanted to destroy its main force and destroy its rear in a short period of time, first imposing its power and then seeking peace. However, it did not know that our country's anti-Japanese sentiment was surging and boiling, and the generals of various provinces gathered in the capital. Their spiritual unity was unprecedented. Not only did the Central Government have an overall plan, but the provinces were also preparing to fight everywhere. Thus, a local conflict turned into a national war of resistance. The Japanese military, fearing a protracted war due to internal and external worries, allowed Kawagoe, who was prevented from returning south, to go to Nanjing. If it could actually control Pingjin and make peace, it could come to a conclusion. Japan can seek peace, but what about us? If the Japanese military withdraws from Pingjin after gathering a large army and restores the situation to its original state, it would be tantamount to announcing its own crimes, and its position would be shaken, which would be the natural result. Therefore, the military will never give up Pingjin and make peace. Then, can we give up Pingjin and make peace? If we give up Pingjin and make peace, it would allow the Japanese military's policy of nibbling to succeed. If Japan can nibble at Pingjin and make peace, why can't it nibble at Huanyuan, Lu and Jin in the future and make peace again? The nibbling is advancing, and peace is following. With the last peace, China will have no land left. The art of war says, "Place yourselves in a position of desperation, and you will live." This is the true meaning of our war of resistance this time. If we fear death, we cannot avoid it. If we are not afraid of death, then our country has hope of survival. May all our compatriots rise up, etc.</p>

<h3>Hengli Bank Closes Due to the Impact of the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Shareholders' Meeting to Be Held on the 30th of This Month to Discuss Future Actions</p>
<p>Hengli Commercial Savings Bank, located at 100 Tianjin Road in this city, has decided to suspend business due to the impact of the current situation, after a meeting of the board of directors. A shareholders' meeting will be held on the 30th of this month to discuss future actions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>History of the Bank</p>
<p>Hengli Bank was reorganized from Hengli Real Estate Loan Company, which was established in April of the 14th year of the Republic. In April of the 17th year, the founding meeting was held. The original registered capital was 300,000 yuan in national currency. In the 19th year, an additional 200,000 yuan was added, making a total of 500,000 yuan. In August of the same year, it was approved by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to register and establish the company. In August of the 20th year, it purchased real estate at the corner of Tianjin Road and Henan Road and built a new building. Two years later, the construction was completed and the bank moved in. In the same year, an additional 250,000 yuan of share capital was raised, bringing the total to 750,000 yuan. In January of the 23rd year, it joined the Shanghai Banking Association as a member.</p>
<p>Business Situation</p>
<p>In addition to the general commercial transactions conducted by the Commercial Department, the bank also has a Savings Department. Over the years, the business has been quite developed. The recently announced assets and liabilities of the Savings Department for the first half of this year show that the total revenue and expenditure was more than 540,000 yuan, with various deposits totaling more than 410,000 yuan and a net profit of more than 4,000 yuan. The current chairman of the board of directors is Yue Zhenbao, and the manager is Yue Gengrong. There are approximately 50 employees in the entire bank.</p>
<p>Temporary Shutdown</p>
<p>Since the expansion of the North China Incident, the bank has been deeply affected. Therefore, the board of directors decided to voluntarily suspend business. This morning, the bank entrusted lawyer Wu Linkun and accountant Pan Xulun to issue a notice stating, "According to the Hengli Bank Co., Ltd. board of directors, the bank is currently affected by the current situation. The board decided on the 8th of this month to temporarily suspend business from the 9th of this month and to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on the 30th of this month to decide on the bank's future actions. Please notify all interested parties accordingly." Therefore, the announcement is made as above.</p>
<p>Inventory of Cash</p>
<p>This morning, lawyer Wu and others, accompanied by manager Yue of the company, went to the bank to count the cash and accounting books in the vault and seal them in the vault. Currently, only a few employees are left in the bank for safekeeping. When reporters visited the closed front door, an employee informed them that they were unaware of the shutdown beforehand, so the reason was unknown. The cash in the vault amounts to more than 20,000 yuan, and the various small loans amount to approximately 400,000 yuan. The released account is very large, and the revenue and expenditure can be offset. The bank also provides safe deposit boxes and is currently urging depositors to retrieve them.</p>
<h3>Female Employee Accuses of Immorality</h3>
<p>Confessions from Both Parties Are Not Complete; Court Hearing Adjourned for One Week for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Madam Huang Zhou, a local woman residing at No. 1, Ruyi Lane, Lanwei Ai Road, French Concession, used to be a teacher at Wanzhu Elementary School in this city and is now a private tutor. Her daughter, Huang Qifang, is 16 years old and is a student at the Provincial Women's Normal School of Hebei Province. She used to be a female employee at a store in the corner of Ximen. In November of last year, Huang Qifang was introduced by her friend Chen Lingzhen to Xu Wending (also known as Zhipeng, 23 years old), a Shanghai native residing at No. 51, 200 Lane, Xinzha Road. At first, they only had</p>
<p>a friendship, which later developed into love. From January 1st to 3rd of this year, they engaged in licentious acts in Room 323 of the Yangtze Hotel, No. 278, Yunnan Road, and then rented a house at No. 90, Yongyu Lane, Ximen Road, French Concession, and lived together. But Madam Zhou was completely unaware of this. However, after Huang and Xu had a relationship, she became pregnant. She is now five or six months pregnant. Recently, the girl suddenly developed a dislike for Xu and discussed ways to break up. Unexpectedly, Madam Huang Zhou also discovered this matter. So, on the 8th of this month, when Xu Yinqing</p>
<p>went to the Zhimeilou Restaurant on Fuzhou Road for dinner, she summoned Detective Cao Qishan of the Old Zha Police Station to arrest Xu and take him to the Old Zha Police Station. Xu fully admitted to having a relationship with Huang and renting a house to live together. However, he claimed that Huang was actually a female employee of the Lelu Guidance Agency. He originally wanted to meet Wu Yaqin, a female employee of the agency. One day, he called Wu at the Yangtze Hotel, but Wu was not there. The agency sent another Huang (referring to the plaintiff) to come, and that's how they met. Then,</p>
<p>they had a relationship, but this matter had her daughter's consent, etc. Subsequently, Detective Cao went to the Yangtze Hotel to investigate and found that Xu had used the alias Xu Zhijun when he booked the room. Huang Zhou also presented her daughter's graduation diploma to prove that her daughter was still under 16 years old. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Special First Court. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station explained the process and prosecuted them for the crime of endangering public morals under Article 227 of the Criminal Law. Huang Zhou and her daughter also hired Lawyer Xiang Yu to represent them in court. Judge Feng Shide, because the case concerned public morals, prohibited the audience from listening. It was heard that the two sides disputed the identity of the plaintiff mother and daughter fiercely. As a result, after the court hearing, it was adjourned for one week for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Two Thieves Involved in a Gang Robbery of Government Salt Arrested</h3>
<p>Temporarily Detained; Awaiting Evidence for Transfer</p>
<p>Last month, Wuhe Refined Salt Company loaded 900 packages of refined salt from Yuyao, Zhejiang, and transported it to this city. On the 26th of this month, when passing through Songjiang, it was learned by Yao gang bandits, who gathered a large number of bandits and used weapons to rob 500 packages (each package weighing 100 pounds), scattering far and wide. The case was reported to the local water and land police, and the Second District of the Songjiang Salt Affairs Administration Tax Police Department of the Ministry of Finance issued an order to arrest the fleeing bandit gang. Now, at 11 p.m. on the 7th of this month, the investigator of the Gongmao Government Salt Stack No. 4 in this city received a secret report that a bandit gang involved in this case was passing through Mintini Yin Road in the French Concession. He led the investigator to the front of the Great World Amusement Park at the appointed time. The investigator identified Zhang A'ao (25 years old, also known as A Niu, from Yuyao) and Chen Guofa (36 years old, also known as Yanqing, from Haining). The two were arrested and, along with Hua Police No. 208, were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Court No. 1 of the Special First Court. Judge Chen Shuoying interrogated them. Zhang A'ao claimed that he dried salt in his hometown and made a living dragging kiln goods in Shanghai and had no fixed residence. Chen Guofa claimed that he used to work as a boatman, but after his mother died, he returned to his hometown and then came to Shanghai and had no fixed residence, etc. Subsequently, Lawyer Gu Shouxi of the Police Department stated the case, briefly stating that the police station had received a letter from the Songjiang Salt Affairs Administration Tax Police Department requesting assistance in arresting the defendants because the defendants had formed a gang to rob government salt in Songjiang on July 26. However, the defendants denied the matter. The Police Department, according to Article 7 of the agreement, would hand over the defendants and that the requesting transfer would have to provide evidence to prove the defendants' criminal facts. After questioning today, please temporarily detain the defendants, etc. Jiang Zhiheng, the squad leader sent by the Second District of the Songjiang Salt Affairs Administration Tax Police Department, also came to the court and claimed that he had come to the court with a document to transfer the two defendants, but he did not know the details of the robbery, etc. Zhang Ao and Chen Guofa, after being questioned, both flatly denied having robbed refined salt and requested a detailed investigation by the court. After verifying the confession, the hearing was adjourned, and the two defendants were detained to await the Songjiang Salt Affairs Administration Tax Police Department to send an official document with evidence to the court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Chen Shizhang and Others from Wenxi Paper Company Go Abroad</h3>
<p>Wang Yunwu, Wang Boqi and Others Send Them Off</p>
<p>Wenxi Paper Company is building a paper mill and has already surveyed the site in Yongjia, Zhejiang Province, and is actively proceeding. In order to select various machines, the company specially sent Ma Yinliang, the managing director, Chen Shizhang, the general manager, and Jin Han, the deputy general manager, abroad for investigation, also taking the opportunity to inspect the paper industry in various countries to provide price references. Chen and Jin departed yesterday morning (the 9th) at 8 o'clock on the Empress of Japan bound for the United States at the customs wharf. Wang Yunwu, the chairman of the board of directors of the company, Wang Boqi, Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Shanyang, Chu Yaohuan, and the relatives and friends of the two men went to the port to see them off. It is heard that the two men will arrive in San Francisco on the 15th of this month and transfer to a train to visit various places, staying for about a month, and will take a boat to Europe on the 22nd of the following month, arriving in the United Kingdom at the end of the month. Mr. Ma is scheduled to take the Italian auxiliary Conte Verde directly to Italy on the 2nd of the following month, and then go to the United Kingdom to meet the two men, and then go to various countries in Europe for inspection, with an expected return to the country at the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Extraordinary Emergency Meeting of the Bar Association</h3>
<p>2 p.m. on the 15th at the New Building</p>
<p>In view of the serious national crisis, the Shanghai Bar Association has decided to convene an extraordinary general meeting of all members on the 15th of this month. The meeting place was originally planned to be held at the current association office at 30 Gaonaiyi Road in the French Concession. Because the association office is small and many members will inevitably attend the meeting, the Standing Committee has decided to move the extraordinary members' meeting scheduled for 2 p.m. on the 15th of this month to the second floor of the building (association office) currently under construction at the corner of Beile Road and Lafayette Road in the French Concession. Yesterday, it notified the craftsmen to quickly arrange the second floor for use at the meeting. It also notified all members to take the time to attend the meeting on the second floor of the unfinished association office at the corner of Beile Road and Lafayette Road at that time.</p>
<h3>Women's Home Lecture Meeting in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Women's New Life Movement Promotion Association believes that women are responsible for the rise and fall of the country. Therefore, it will hold a home lecture meeting in extraordinary times. It is scheduled to be held at 4:30 p.m. tomorrow (the 11th) in the auditorium of the YWCA on Jing'an Temple Road. Dr. Zhang Xiangwen will give a lecture on "The Responsibilities of Women to the Country." Women from all walks of life are welcome to attend the lecture.</p>
<h3>New Hurricane Continues to Advance Towards Our Coast</h3>
<p>Direction Still North-West, Wind Force Unknown</p>
<p>The new hurricane that originated north of Guam in the Pacific Ocean is still advancing towards our coast. Yesterday, it had reached between 18 degrees north latitude and 129 degrees east longitude. The direction is north-west, and the center of the wind force is within a range of 120 nautical miles from the reported position. The strength of the wind is still unknown.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River Had Another High Tide Yesterday</h3>
<p>Because the Huangpu River is entering the autumn flood season, there was another high tide yesterday, above 13 feet, which caused the tide to overflow the bank at the intersection of North Suzhou Road and Gansu Road. Fortunately, the warehouses had flood control equipment, so the goods stored in the warehouses were protected from water damage. However, the waterlogging did not recede until 7 a.m. today, which caused considerable traffic problems.</p>
<h3>New President of the Local Court Scheduled to Take Office Today</h3>
<p>Lu Yimei, the president of the Shanghai Local Court, has been ordered by the Ministry to be transferred to Zhou Zuchen, the president of the Wuhu High Court Branch of Anhui. President Zhou has already arrived in Shanghai and is scheduled to take office at the court today (i.e., the 10th of this month).</p>
<h3>False Alarm of Fire</h3>
<p>The two-story building at No. 19, Second Lane, Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street (i.e., Ningxing Street) in the French Concession is owned by Dehe Foreign Firm and has been vacant for more than a year. Recently, due to the tense situation, residents of the Chinese Concession have moved into the French Concession, so the vacant house at that number was jointly rented by five families, including a certain Mr. from Beiping. At 7:30 p.m. yesterday (the 9th), a tenant in a second-floor wing room was burning a stove inside, and sparks flew everywhere, with blazing flames. Neighbors caught a glimpse and mistook it for a fire. Someone blew a whistle wildly. The French Concession Fire Brigade quickly dispatched two fire engines to the rescue. After investigation, it was found to be a misunderstanding, and the police also sent Chinese and French detectives to investigate. The person who blew the whistle without permission will be questioned and held accountable. The residents of the lane were all greatly alarmed.</p>
<h3>Court Magistrate Accused of Abuse of Power, Trial Concluded</h3>
<p>Awaiting Scheduled Sentencing</p>
<p>Chen Guansheng, who runs a teahouse in Zhoujiadu, Pudong, was sued for fraud. The presiding magistrate, Shao Tizhi (now transferred to Wuxian as a prosecutor), detained Chen Guansheng for more than the legal limit of three months during the trial. Chen Guansheng had already been released on bail, but the magistrate again detained Chen, so he filed a private prosecution in the local court against Shao Tizhi for abuse of power. He was summoned, but the defendant never appeared. Yesterday, Magistrate Chen Enyong opened the court for trial. Chen Guansheng testified that he was 31 years old, a local, and worked at Gongxing Heji Land Freight Firm, No. 6 Xujiazhai, Zhoujiadu, Pudong. The official said that the criminal court's trial was in accordance with the indictment, and according to the record of the criminal court's trial date, it did not exceed the time limit. The Judicial Yuan has a clear explanation. Chen Guansheng testified that the criminal court only opened the trial more than ten days after the indictment, but he did not know whether these ten days were in the investigation or in the trial. His spirit, reputation, and money have suffered great losses. Shanghai is one of the major commercial ports in China, and the people will suffer if Magistrate Shao abuses his power in this way. He asked the presiding judge to make a judgment according to the law. The official said that Magistrate Chen had a ruling to extend the detention for two months during the retrial. Chen supplied that why it was not mentioned when Magistrate Xie Zhengnong once tried it after I reported it. If there was an extension of the detention, why did Magistrate Chen approve my bail? At this point, the official ruled that the summons was legally served, and then began the debate. After the debate, he considered it concluded and scheduled the sentencing.</p>
<h3>Passenger's Body Recovered from Huangpu River</h3>
<p>At 10 p.m. on the 6th of this month, when the regular Shanghai-Ningbo liner "Xin Ning Shao" arrived at the port, a sampan carrying three passengers returning to Ningbo and two porters attempted to board the ship which was berthed offshore. Unexpectedly, due to the rapid tide and large waves, it suddenly capsized. It was reported yesterday that porter Lu Guisheng and an unknown man were drowned. Now it is learned that the body of Lu Guisheng floated to the surface of the Huangpu River at the Xinguang Wharf yesterday morning. It was recovered by the Customs Water Police Station. Detective Shi Ajin took the body to the Rescue Bureau and reported it to the local court. An official was commissioned to examine the body in the evening. Because the relatives of the deceased are all in Ningbo, their hometown, the neighbors were instructed to prepare a coffin for the burial first.</p>
<h3>Two Robbers Seize Car on Beijing Road</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 11 a.m., Shan Shicheng, a driver for the Beida Dyeing Factory in Tanjiaqiao, Liuying Road, Zhabei, was driving a car with city license plate number 1203 and rental license plate number 2059, on the order of the factory manager Xia Changfan, from the factory to the distribution office on Tianjin Road, Beijing Road, in the concession. Unexpectedly, when passing the entrance of Wufu Lane, two robbers dressed in black Xiangyunsha short jackets and trousers suddenly jumped out and blocked the vehicle. They jumped into the car, pulled out a pistol to intimidate him into silence, first slapped the driver twice, and then forced the driver to drive at full speed westward. Until evening, neither the driver nor the car were found. Manager Xia immediately reported to the police station in the Chinese concession to investigate.</p>
<h3>Feibo Company Broadcasts War News</h3>
<p>The Feibo Wireless Electrical Material Company, located west of the Sacred Heart Church on Foch Road, in order to facilitate citizens to listen to important war news, has been broadcasting war news every day at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. since August 1st. The company was founded by Mr. Wang, a wireless expert who studied in the United States, with strong capital and attentive service.</p>
<h3>Zhang Futin Loses More Than 400,000 in Speculation</h3>
<p>Feeling That He Cannot Face His Master, He Surrenders to the Authorities with His Lawyer</p>
<p>Mei Zhongshang and Mei Shuhe, wealthy merchants from Wuxing, Zhejiang, operate the Mei E Ji Silk Store at No. 4 Qianji Lane, Tianjin Road, Shanghai. They hired Zhang Futin (45 years old, residing at No. 9 Wuchangli, Avenue Road), a fellow townsman, as the chief accountant. Zhang has been trading in public bonds and yarn in recent years, and the amount of profit and loss has been temporarily paid from the store's public funds. There has been no huge amount in and out of the account on weekdays. However, recently, due to the situation, Zhang's transactions have suffered great losses, reaching more than 400,000, which have been paid with the store's public funds. Zhang felt ashamed because the losses were too great and he had failed his master's trust. He had no choice but to hire lawyer Li Zhongwen at 8:30 p.m. the day before yesterday to prepare to surrender himself. Accompanied by Lawyer Li, he surrendered to the Central Police Station and requested that the accounts be thoroughly investigated. Detective Jiang Shangpei investigated the case and detained Zhang. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First Court by police and lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the situation. Because the defendant had already surrendered himself, the police station needed to conduct a detailed investigation. Therefore, it was requested that Zhang Futin be temporarily detained for investigation. After Magistrate Feng Shide briefly questioned Zhang, he approved the detention for a week for further questioning.</p>

<h3>Wu Zhi Lao—Talks About Donating Money to Save the Country</h3>
<p>— Quiet</p>
<p>Wu Zhi Lao, an important figure in the party and the country, is most eloquent. Recently, someone asked him for his opinion on the matter of "donating money to save the country." Wu Lao immediately gave a grand speech, with many pertinent points. Wu said:</p>
<p>"Saving the country is not a matter of empty slogans. Empty slogans are futile. For example, if a beggar asks someone for money, if the person has no money, no matter how much he cries, it is useless. Saving the country is the same.</p>
<p>At present, the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent. The common people should do their best to contribute and fulfill their responsibilities. The officials should take the lead and bear the responsibility of 'leading the people'. I have seen many official friends who usually build foreign houses, buy cars, hold banquets, and spend money like dirt, but they do not contribute a penny to national affairs. This kind of mentality is very undesirable. We read the History of the Ming Dynasty, when Chongzhen was in power, strong bandits often invaded. The emperor asked the ministers to donate money to recruit soldiers and buy horses, but all the ministers said they were poor and decorated their homes to look as poor as possible. As a result, the Ming Dynasty perished, and these ministers did not see any benefits. This is a lesson from the past, how can it not be worrying!</p>
<p>Recently, Kemal and Hitler have donated their private property to the government, seeing the country as more important than the family, because without the country, there is no family. This kind of concept is most worth imitating. Here, I hope that the officials of our country, from top to bottom, will also transfer their enthusiasm for loving their families to loving the country. Then, in a few years, China will definitely become strong."</p>
<h3>Saving the Country with Waste</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>"Even if you are poor, there are still three dans of copper in the house." This is an old Chinese proverb. Although in fact, it is not necessarily true that every family has three dans of copper, on average, every family still has ten or eight pounds of waste copper and scrap iron. Germany, due to the lack of raw materials, advocated in its four-year plan to contribute waste copper and scrap iron to the country for use in times of emergency. Our China's emergency period is already imminent. What kind of thoughts should we have about the waste copper and scrap iron piled in the corners of our homes?</p>
<p>Last time, a certain important person toured the Soviet Union and suggested that the cheongsam and robes be shortened by one foot each. If each person saves one foot of fabric for each piece of clothing, the whole country can save 400 million feet of fabric. Although this is something that no one has said before, it is true. Because in practice, not saving what can be saved is waste. From this theory, I think that in this period of emergency, everyone should also have an awakening about the gold rings on their fingers. What is the meaning of putting a gold ring on your finger? Isn't that a complete waste? When Italy fought against Abyssinia, the general public donated their wedding rings to the government and eventually conquered Abyssinia. In China, if 400 million people donate an average of one cent of gold to the government, we can raise 4 million taels of gold. Think about using 4 million taels of gold to beat the government to the ground?</p>
<p>Not long ago, the price of old newspapers soared. At that time, there was a rumor that someone from a certain country was buying them for manufacturing bombs. Although this rumor has not been confirmed, in recent days, due to the increasing urgency of the emergency period, someone has been buying waste copper and scrap iron to manufacture guns and cannons, which is rampant. Germany values waste copper and scrap iron, and the Italians are willing to donate gold to the country, but the Chinese people are still indifferently selling waste copper and scrap iron, indirectly providing funds to the enemy. Where should we start with this?</p>
<h3>Poems by Soldiers at Lugou Bridge</h3>
<p>— Gou Juexian</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Wu abandoned his pen and joined the army last year. He is in a certain army in Hebei, fighting on the front line, defending the country with his weapons, and fighting to the death with the enemy. Recently, I received a letter from him from the battlefield, with three poems attached. I quickly recorded them for the readers to enjoy:</p>
<p>First</p>
<p>Years of accumulated shame, not a single morning, enemy riders have arrived at Lugou Bridge again. How can we bear to watch the country be nibbled away? Swear to kill Loulan and refuse to give in. When the broadsword rises, heads fall, when the iron arm waves, the thieves' courage disappears. It is only that the general's heart has not been decided, and the sounds of peace are mixed with the sounds of war.</p>
<p>Second</p>
<p>Where is the vast country? The liver and gallbladder are burning when compromise is made. The generals are determined to eliminate the captives, but the civil officials have no intention of recovering the city. The wind is rustling by the Yongding River, and the water is rippling under the Lugou Bridge. It is a pity that the place where the fierce battle was fought last night, today the golden gong rings and the troops are withdrawn again.</p>
<p>Third</p>
<p>A man has the ambition to engage in a long expedition, and he never considers life and death when serving the country. Throwing his head as a bullet, sticking his flesh and blood to build the Great Wall. It is only when he kills the enemy in front of the horse that his heart is satisfied. Talking about war on paper is always mediocre. Tell the outstanding talents in Guanzhong, if you don't fight at this time, what else can you do?</p>
<h3>Chess Game</h3>
<h3>Inscription on General Zhao's Picture of Deng Yu Beating a Tiger</h3>
<p>— Chen Ai</p>
<p>A piece of paper retains the spirit. Who is the one in military uniform? He is on the tiger's back. Waving his fist in anger. This is General Zhao. I admire him. His attitude is truly heroic. Slightly with grace. Courage envelops the general's body. Iron casts the general's bones. At that time, he served Lord Feng. He killed enemies in the wilderness. Picture this to express his far-reaching ambitions. Lord Feng could not bear to part with it. The general has now become a national martyr. Soliciting the extraordinary loyalty. Try to circle the Nanyuan Road in your dreams. Only then will you know that the general is not only beating a tiger. Makes me hold this and tears fall like rain</p>
<h3>The Time Has Come</h3>
<p>When has it ever happened? The whole country is so united. When has it ever happened? The whole country is so excited, like a lion jumping out of its cage, roaring and shaking the heavens and the earth! Even the heavens say that the time has come, and China will now defeat Japan.</p>
<p>There is no distinction between south and north, no distinction between young and old, tooth for tooth, eye for eye; not afraid of sacrifice, not wanting to survive; the last drop of blood must flow, the last life must be fought! Old humiliations are settled at once, creating a free Chinese national soul. (Yan Chonglou) (Contribution to National Defense Donation)</p>
<h3>Classical Anti-Japanese Talks</h3>
<p>— Piercing Heart</p>
<p>▼ Houyi Shoots the Sun: Ancient mythology says that at the beginning of the world there were ten suns. Houyi was good at archery, and he shot down nine of them with a strong crossbow, so now there is only one "sun" left. Therefore, if we talk about heroes who resist Japan, Houyi is really the first person in ancient and modern times. It is a pity that there is no Houyi now, otherwise, another arrow would be awarded to this "sun", at least to extinguish its poisonous flames a little.</p>
<p>▼ Kua Fu Chases the Sun: The Classic of Mountains and Seas says: "Kua Fu wanted to chase the sun's shadow, so he went to the edge of Yanggu. He was thirsty and wanted to drink, so he went to the river to drink. It was not enough, so he was going to go north and drink in the big swamp, but he died of thirst before he reached it. His staff, which had been soaked in grease, grew into Denglin bamboo, covering tens of miles. Kua Fu's pursuit of the sun's shadow can be said to be extremely difficult, but his spirit of fighting to the death is admirable. Moreover, he died chasing the sun, and his sincerity was condensed, and he could still turn into Denglin bamboo to shield the sun and resist the sun. His anti-Japanese spirit is really immortal for thousands of years?!</p>
<p>▼ Shu Dogs Bark at the Sun: Han Yu: "Shu is a mountainous land with little sun. When the sun comes out, the dogs bark at it." In fact, the Shu dogs may not just be ignorant because they have not seen it often, but because they know that the poisonous flames of the sun bring no good to the people, so when they see the sun, they bark together, intending to drive away the violent sun. If we do not have the courage to resist Japan, we are not as good as the Shu dogs!</p>
<p>▼ White Rainbow Pierces the Sun: Historical Records: "Jing Ke entered Qin to assassinate the King of Qin, and Prince Dan of Yan sent him off at Yishui, singing: 'The wind is rustling, the water of Yishui is cold, and the warrior will not return! Sincerity moves the heavens, and a white rainbow pierces the sun." Later, although the assassination failed, he was executed with generosity; but his ambition to eliminate violence had been determined to die early, so the sincerity was condensed, and a white rainbow pierced the sun. This kind of heroic spirit can also be passed down for thousands of years. Note: White rainbow symbolizes Jing Ke, and "sun" symbolizes the tyrant. The two words "violent sun" are even more reliable and trustworthy.</p>
<p>▼ Farmer Basking in the Sun: Liezi: "There was a farmer in Song who basked in the sun and did not know that there were large houses in the world, lined with cotton and fox fur, and said to his wife: 'No one knows the warmth of basking in the sun. If I offer it to my lord, I will surely be rewarded heavily.'" According to this story, although Liezi was able to record the facts, he completely misunderstood the farmer's original intention. Think about it: although the farmer himself has not lived in a large house or worn cotton and fox fur, hasn't he even seen them? He is still basking in the sun in the hot weather of June. Why? Because when basking in the sun in winter, there will not be a feeling of "no one knows." Only on a hot summer day, when the sun's poisonous flames are rampant, this farmer is fierce by nature and not afraid of poisonous flames. He deliberately basks in the sun to forge his anti-Japanese spirit, so he said to himself, "If I offer it to my lord, I will surely be rewarded heavily." It is a pity that Liezi did not know his intention and laughed at him for being short-sighted. In fact, knowing yourself and knowing the enemy, you can win every battle. The farmer's basking in the sun is precisely to resist the violent sun with his copper skin and iron bones, to test how fierce the poisonous sun is? Whether it can kill people by steaming them, and then offer this idea to his lord, so that the people of the whole country will not be afraid of the sun like tigers.</p>
