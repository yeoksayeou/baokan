<h3>到百靈廟去（三）</h3>
<p>— 本報記者錢華</p>
<p>蒙古草地百餘里無人烟　塞外冰雪前綫將土生活</p>
<p>確如元邱處機詩所云“地無木植惟荒草天產邱陵沒大山”，汽車至此開足速度，橫衙直撞，如入無人之境。沿途所看見的祇是稀稀落落的牛羊為羣，百餘里的距離，無村落，無人烟。這裹氣候更冷了，北風怒號，面部露出的皮膚凍得麻木不仁，呼吸都有些急促起來，實在忍不住了。大家把剩餘下來的老羊皮大氅合戴在頭上，相互的擁抱着取暖。有説有笑有歌唱的車上熱鬧空氣，受了極度寒冷的威脅，頓時沉寂下來。祇聽見車輪呼呼的輾動聲音，和車後飛揚的灰沙，就是這樣子行了兩個多鐘頭。張開眼睛望望老是高阜和草原，什麼也沒有，直如在太平洋中航行一般。我們呼吸出來的水蒸氣在大衣的皮領上都結成了碎冰，留有小鬍子的高大隊長鬍子上也是冰花，大家望着苦笑，還是一語不發，到了四點半鐘，百靈廟外面的山峯遠遠看見了。一聲歡呼，像哥倫布發現了新大陸。我們掙扎出業最後的勇氣，高唱起凱旋的軍歌。一個個眉飛色舞，一忽兒車開到了山脚下，十幾名國防前綫的哨兵跑了過來，略為詢問，二位站在車綠上，其餘幾位都在車前領路，車輪像牛步似的慢慢的越過了幾道極嚴密的防禦綫，開進了山口，國防前錢的百靈廟就豁然呈現在我們目前。</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>八卦式的建築</p>
<p>我們一直開到百囊廟前下車　這裏有許多白色金邊莊嚴燦爛的西藏式高塔，遠望一座一座的大寺院，外面粉刷成雪也似的白色，在暮色蒼茫崗巒環繞中反映出業的色彩更加強烈。使遠來的旅客起了一種不可思議的神秘觀念。攻下百靈廟的孫蘭封旅，現存就駐防該處。旅長因公赴綏，參謀長袁慶榮代表出來歡迎。就約略的導遊一週。喇嘛廟旁邊是喇嘛住的小院落，每個院子大小相同，構造相同，而且胡同樣子也相同，轉來轉去好像是原來的地方。袁參謀長説，這是喇嘛按着八卦圖形建築的，初來的人假使沒有喇嘛領導，一出門就回不到原住的所在。我們弟兄初到這裏的頭幾天，莫不呌苦連天，一天到晚總要鬧幾次迷路的笑話，現在住熟了，而且每所房子外面都有不同的標記，决不至再出毛病。不過諸位初來此地，還得特別小心，單人匹馬、請勿瞎撞云云。於是我們的神秘觀念又進了一層，是後領進了一所比較寬大一些的院子，分前後兩院，後院正房的墻上，繪着佛像，院子裏築着防禦工事。我們一行人都跨進房門，三間上房收拾得很清潔，裏面的一間舖有地板，裝有最新式的日本省煤火爐。壁角裏堆了兩隻大汽油桶，黑色桶上面漆了白色的滿洲航空株式會社字樣，這種觸目驚心的佈置，使每個人心中所蘊蓄着的神祕觀念更覺得忐忑不甯。這位袁參謀長很激昂的説道，這就是從前駐在百靈廟的日本特務機關長盛島少將的住室。現在他追隨德王，寸步不離，所有種種侵略陰謀，多半由他策劃。他旅居內外蒙占達二十餘年，討了一個蒙古老婆，説得一口極流利的蒙古話，於蒙古情形無所不曉，眞是一位蒙古通。三十餘年來隨時隨地在各種階級中散播着侵略的種子，所以他的勢力已是根深蒂固。近年他訓練許多日本浪人，深入內蒙各地，鼓動自治，做種種挑撥離間的工作，此次戰事他就是罪魁禍首。在我們攻下百靈廟之先一小時，他才乘汽車逃走，祇犧牲了他最親信的助手某某上校，割鬚棄袍，也足以顧出我們的顏色。袁氏很興奮地口講指劃地説着，一羣聽衆也不禁神往，激昂的心理使每個面部的表情有些異樣了。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>德外長訪奧</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>外交代表的訪問友邦大概總不外兩種原因。一種是兩國的邦交本來很好。但為更形增進友好關係起見。因而派遣使節。互相聘問。這種聘問的結果當然能使兩國的密切開係更形增進另一種是兩國的關係未達友好的程度。或兩國間對于某些問題的意見未能一致。於是派遣使節。聘同他國藉以解釋誤會。融和意見。商討橫在他們間的重要問題。這種聘問的結果。有時可以得到很好的結果增進兩國的友好關係有時則會一無所得使聘問的代表失望而歸。</p>
<p>這次德外長牛賴特的聘問奧國。屬於那一種訪問呢。我們與其説是前一種。倒不如説是後一種。德奧兩國雖自去年七月訂立親善協定消除了過去的衝突與誤會。而進入友善的關係。可是兩國間的衝突之源。仍然沒有除去。去年的親善協定祇不過使兩國間的嚴重衝突暫時緩和而已。所以自親善協定締訂後兩國的關係雖在表面上有相當的改進。如極端親意派內衛團勢力的排除。親德派要人的加入內閣。但在實際上兩國間的衝突仍然有增無已。這種糾紛的背後。當然有意國的關係在內。這是不容否認的。因為德意的關係。雖由意外長齊亞諾的訪德與德國戈林將軍的報聘羅馬而大有增進。但兩國間關於中歐利益的衝突。還是無法完全消除的。</p>
<p>德奧兩國最近的衝突問題。我們從十四日奧總理休樞尼格對愛國陣綫領袖一千五百人的演説中可以明顯的看出來。奧總理的演説有兩個要點。一是復辟問題。一是國社黨活動問題。這兩問題是最近德奧衝突的焦點。也是這次牛賴特在維也納談判中的主題。關於復辟問題奧總理在其演説中曾説明愛國陣的態度三點。第一。尊重奧國歷史的傳統。第二。祇有奧國人民方有權决定其所採的國體。第三。國體問題重大。須愼重處理。奧總理雖不主張現在立時實行復辟。但他反對他國干涉奧國政體的態度。却非常明顯。換句話説。奧國復辟問題是内政問題。祇可由奧國人民自己决定。不容他國置喙。但這種態度却深爲德國所反對。因爲德國是絶不容許奧國復辟的。要是奧國實行復辟。那末德國併奧的野心是更無實現的希望了。奧總理在演説中雖主張國體問題須愼重處理。但他並不是反對復辟的人。他祇覺得現在時機還未成熟罷了。同時一般復辟派近來又到處活動。聲勢非常強蹙。這自然是德國所大感不安的。</p>
<p>其次。關於國社黨在奧活動問題。去年七月協定成立後。雖得到暫時的解决。但兩者間的衝突仍然非常尖銳。最近牛賴特到奧國社黨卽舉行盛大示威。高呼“希特勒萬歲。”與政府發生重大衝突。就是願例。奧總理在其最近演説中亦謂設立“日爾曼社會文化同盟”及其他類似之親德團體為不合事宜。同時在奧國一千一百餘名政治犯中。國社黨黨員比共產黨員更多（前者為七百二十五人。後者為四百三十七人。）這些事實都可以説明奧國政府與德國指揮下之奧國國社黨間的衝突。並沒有因去年親善協定的締訂而消除。</p>
<p>這次牛賴特的訪問維也納。雖要就上述兩個重要問題及其他次要問題同休樞尼格政府商討妥善的解决辦法。但是能否得到圓滿的結果。却是很大的疑問。</p>

<p>［維也納］兹據報告、德外長牛賴特今日與奧總理舒斯尼格舉行會議之時、曾提出計劃一項、擬將舊日之三國聯盟恢復、該項計劃規定、如奧國能允諾不再恢復哈布斯堡皇統、德國願担任促成德意奧匈四國絛約、倘奧匈受敵人攻擊、德意兩國應予以積極之援助、但倘德意兩國與他國作戰、奧匈二國僅有維持“友誼中立”之義務、此外復將訂立於奧有特殊利益之經濟協定、以求此四國條約益臻鞏固、據云此種計劃、已由德國單獨決定、因德國深信舒斯尼格已决定恢復奧國之君主制度、倘此舉果成事實、則奧國之國社主義、將永無抬頭之日、蓋德國亦不能以武力阻止奧皇室之復辟也、復據報告、舒氏尚無放棄恢復皇室之傾向、蓋無論何時，奧國若欲恢復君主政體、奧國自有其决擇之權、且舒氏以為、在君主政體之下、四國條約亦非不可存在、再則、舒氏所惴惴者、復恐因此從新引起小協約國及巴爾幹諸國之聯合反對、并聞意首相墨索里尼亦有同樣之疑懼、再則、日昨德外長抵奧都時、奧國國社黨份子之示威舉動、已引起舒斯尼格不少反感、而德國方面、則因有若于奧國國社黨份子之被逮、亦頗覺不滿云（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>［柏林］外傳德外長牛賴特今日曾向奧總理舒斯尼格博士建議、締結德奧意匈叫國防守協定、德政府發言人兹宣稱、對於此項方案、毫無所知云、（中央社二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>［維也納］德國外長牛賴特今日抵此、當有奧國國社黨二百人因參加示威運動、被捕入獄、當局已加調軍警防範、但截至今晚止、除各街稍有騷攪外、尚稱安謐、親德派公安部長史杜美因與許士尼格總理意見不合、傳將去職、果爾則德奧合作運動又受打擊矣、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<p>［維也納］德國外交部長牛賴特昨日抵此之後、奧國國務總理休樞尼格、當晚即在貝爾凡台爾宮、設宴正式加以欵待、情形雖備極輝煌、但與最近招待意國外長齊亞諾及匈牙利攝政霍爾第上將之情形、兩相比較，則殊覺缺少誠摯熱烈之精神、則以國社黨黨員昨日舉行示威運動一舉、有以致之也、因此一般人以為、牛賴特此行，對於德奧兩國輯睦邦交、乃至成立文化協定一事、均難獲得具體結果、此間德國人士甚至以為、德奧兩國原擬在下月杪、組織委員會、以確定文化協定之內容、但就目前情形、恐亦不能有所成就云、總之、牛賴特此行、業因國社黨黨員舉行示威運動一舉、而暗淡無光、至以此項示威連動而論、共為某方所主使、已屬顯而易見、此事確如某要人所謂“事之足以妨碍牛賴特此行價值者、當莫甚於此矣、”又昨日晚间、盛傳愛国陣綫當局、業已召集大批黨員、前來示威、俾國社黨本日賡續示威時、有以答復之、此在各報、則對於國社黨此種示威運動、甚感不安、并以行將引起反響為言、例如半官式聯邦郵報載稱、“在此種示威運動之幕後、必有主使之人、且必有人暗中接濟費用、吾人對於此種內幕、務應加以根究、藉明眞相、”至奧國國社黨員此其所為、乃係希圖破壞去年七月十一日所成立之德奧協定、則已昭然者揭云、又新維也納日報、亦抱有同樣見解、并謂“團社黨黨員凡參加昨日示威運動者、其中一部份係自外省而來、可見彼等早有定謀”云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>白孟愚抵滬談考察茶業</h3>
<p>今後省廣植新茶</p>
<p>神州社云、雲南財政廳、為謀發展該省實業、特派專員白孟愚赴湘皖浙贛等省考察、並特別注重改進植茶事業、業於日前來滬、連日參觀、極見忙碌、記者昨特　訪、探悉各情如次、</p>
<p>沿途考察</p>
<p>據談、滇省產茶、普　向極著名、盛銷後藏、以其味濃質佳、印茶無法與我競爭、惟我國產茶運往後藏、以交通阻塞、須經印度緬甸、轉道而入、現印緬政府正設法收徵滇茶過境稅、故今後普洱茶將在重稅及印人仿製競銷下、有莫大危機、財廳為謀急起補救、特派本人考察、植茶製茶新法、蓋滇邊過去老法製茶、必受淘汰也、自去年十一月出發以來、歷經廣州·衡陽·長沙·漢口·九江·南昌·杭州·等地、為時百日、參觀各茶區域或銷茶市場等、在滬稍作勾留後、將赴北京一行、再轉大連、前赴台灣日本等地考察、約須四月間返省復命、</p>
<p>改進滇茶</p>
<p>至滇省茶產豐富、卽以思茅區而言、則鎮越·佛海·南嶠·臨江·車里·思茅·等縣、均有大量出產、銷往後藏、年約一萬五千擔、銷往內地及川省約三千擔、其他景東區產茶淡而香、順甯區亦佳、大部運銷昆明·或與普洱拼混銷往海外、惟邊縣如南嶠等縣地廣人稀、種植極少、殊屬可惜、故今後改良滇茶辦法、一方面老茶任其自由發展、銷往後藏、一方面利用荒地、廣植新茶、同時謀運銷上　改進、暢銷省際及國際、惟謀改進植茶、必須先謀鄉村建設之改進、過去鄉村建設幾談不到、目前則已漸予注意、着手辦理、使鄉民生活安樂、盡力植茶、</p>
<p>邊地富饒</p>
<p>白氏又談、滇邊各縣、鑛藏旣豐惜未經開發、無論五金煤鑛、莫不齊備、如瀾滄·佛海·鎮越之銀、景谷之金、雙江江城之水銀等等、均得開發、同時需要人才與經濟之助力、又邊地人少、且專有夷民居住、如“葫蘆王地”公明孔明浪掌諸山之外、以漢人無法入內、竟迄未明白其面積人口與富源、益以外人覬覦、實多危機、現滇省自龍主席秉政近年頗為安定、故省府已决定逐慚開發、現在開縣大莊、已設墾殖局、主持墾荒事宜、尤注意夷民教育、在佛海雙江、均設夷人師範、又其他各地遍設小學、使夷人與漢習俗一致、邊陲開發、更較易矣、邊疆有關國防、而人口稀少、將來內地移民、頗為重要云、</p>

<h3>統一與和平（續）</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>最近另有人説，要統一祗有抗敵。這是“以抗敵求統一”之一説：反之，他們以為如果不統一，一定有人不抗敵。試問：什麼人不抗敵？他們心目之中，以為中央不抗敵，所以西安事變就被這般糊塗蟲居然做出來了。他們以為中央是不抗敵的，必像共匪叛將纔是抗敵的。所以中央軍在綏遠作戰，他們偏偏要説中央軍在綏遠是監督傅作義的。一二八時，第五軍開到江濤廟行一帶抗敵，有壯烈的犧牲，他們偏偏要説第五軍是來繳十九路軍的械的。綏遠前綫防禦工事的經費，大半由中央撥欵補助，才能迅速完成，他們偏偏説中央不願抗敵。其居心實不堪問！反之，假使張學良的軍隊是抗敵的，為什麼九一八的時候不殺身成仁？長城山海關打仗的時候不出力？甚至於在綏遠前方抗戰正烈的時候，在西安刦持指揮抗敵的統帥，使得前方抗敵軍士受到影響，這是眞正抗敵嗎？這是“以抗敵求統一”嗎？？我認友邦是要聯敵人是要抗的。但是要抗敵，一定要全國一致的抗敵，要在統一命令之下抗敵才可以有效。這就是“尊王攘夷”，也就是“安內攘外。這個眞理，連共產黨現在也只好承認。</p>
<p>恰巧我今天買到一張共產黨的民衆報，其中有一段話，是説明須先統一而後抗敵。這篇文字的標題是“眞正的統一救國運動”，彷彿近來各地所熱烈鼓吹的統一救國運動是假的，祗有他這篇所説才是眞的。他的原文是：</p>
<p>“第一，中國是不是需要統一？我們的答案是：毫無疑義的，中國絕對需要統一。我們在政治上軍事上假如不能完成統一，我們對外决不能抗戰，對內决不能安定民生。</p>
<p>“第二，我們要怎樣實現眞正的統一？我們的答案是：我們要以聯合完成統一；以抗敵鞏固統一。”</p>
<p>“第三，統一以後幹什麼？我們的答案是：以統一求抗敵的勝利。”</p>
<p>第一段，他承認需要統一，而且承認政治軍事統一之後才能抗敵，否則對外不能抗敵，對內不能安定民生。第二段乃與第一段相反，説要以抗敵鞏固統一，這就是“以抗敵求統一”的論調了。照此説法，無異是主張不抗敵就不能統一，豈不是與第一段相反嗎？可是第三段又與第二段相反，説以統一求抗敵的勝利，反過來説，不統一則抗敵未必勝利。照他這三段説法，試問：究竟是先統一呢還是先抗敵呢？眞使人莫名其妙。好像是鷄先生蛋，還是蛋先孵鷄，成了一個滑稽的疑問。為什麼他們説得這樣矛盾呢？因為目前中國的需要統一是無可否認的，但是他又不願意肯定的承認統一為首要，偏要説聯合，説抗敵，以致不能自圓其説，到處碰壁。所以根據共產黨的報紙，也可以證明必須統一之後才能抗敵，抗敵才能勝利。</p>
<p>我們的主張則不像共產黨一樣，忽東忽西，不可捉摸。我們不像他們從前鼓吹階級鬥爭，現在又來説民族解放，不惜今日之我與昨日之我挑戰。我們始終承認：唯有統一才能眞正抗敵，亦惟有統一，對外才能有眞正的戰爭。綏遠的抗戰算得國際戰爭嗎？一二八之役算得國際戰爭嗎？長城之役算得國際戰爭嗎？這都不能算眞正的現代戰爭，祇算消極的抵抗而已。現代一國與一國間的戰爭，是整個國家的戰爭，是國家總動員力量的比較。淞滬之役，打了一個多月，敵人才從瀏河上岸包抄後路，並且祗在閘北江灣一帶作戰，連南市租界完全不去牽動，是可以看作眞正的戰爭嗎？再拿長城之役，熱河之戰來説，敵人並不派了大批軍隊先佔北平天津，把後方鐵路截斷，也不能看作國際間正式的戰爭。如果眞正的打起仗來，敵人早已四面八方的進攻，無論是黃河流域，長江流域，珠江流域，都有受飛機，大砲，炸彈，毒氣威脅的危險，我們內部如果不統一，能够眞正作抗敵的大規模戰爭嗎？要抗敵，至少須求軍事指揮的一致，行政機構的一貫，財政餉械的集中，但如果不統一，這些事能够做到麼？所以我們應該始終深信，要對外抗敵，是先要盡全國上下的力，做到眞正的統一，不然，則抗敵二字不過標榜而已，何嘗能希望因抗敵而反得到統一呢？（未完）</p>

<h3>上海埠際足球隊長軋許論滬港得失之原因</h3>
<p>滬隊因採用W式戰略成功　傑姆妙論　香港指示我們如何踢球　我們則教香港如何射門</p>
<p>上海西人足球會之埠際足球隊、此次於出人意料之外、將港隊擊敗、凱旋歸來、管理及隊長軋許、抵滬後、談此次得勝之原因、及港方之所以失敗者甚詳、於足球之戰略與技術、大有參考之價值、譯之如次、</p>
<p>此次南遊、球員間之精神甚佳關於比賽之戰略、最為注意、以冀勝利、最後决定採用W式、對於香港、雖所有隊員、並非金習於此方法、但在英國、職業隊用之、極為順利、故上海隊卒用此方法可佔便宜也、</p>
<p>天時不佳、史德格脫船遲到、五日晚才抵港、原定下午可到也、香港足球會迎之於埠、次晨全隊往海軍球場練習二小時、此日天氣奇佳、球員個個精神煥發、次日卽須比賽、是晚皆歸宿甚早、</p>
<p>星期四進早午餐後、全隊搭車往海軍球場、觀眾已滿座、以比賽論、殊非為第一流之比賽、但在觀眾之立聲言、則無時無刻、不在驚駭中、</p>
<p>關於港隊方面之批評、中堅金卑路（Campbell）之最大錯誤、為不直接送球於兩翼、—如果當時用此方法、結果或將大變—自始至終、—金以球傳交左右兩前衛、再送達前方、更有一錯誤、李惠堂雖在上海守衛者嚴密監視之下金仍時以球傳給李也、</p>
<p>馮景祥、港隊之右內鋒、踢來頭腦極為清晰、但其錯誤、亦為時以球傳交在嚴重監視下之李惠堂、如果馮當時自行攻取、或反收效也</p>
<p>比賽之前滬隊中峯勞巴斯托夫、卽受命當入駐港方面後衛之間、當然、因此大告由奴頓其效力、以須監視勞也、港隊守門為中國亞林比克足球隊之守門包家平、其所失之球、皆無可挽救者、福恩之兩球、尤為美妙、下半時之一球、傑姆華特之一脚妙傳、福恩得之、如飛衝進、敏速可驚、包束手無策、</p>
<p>滬隊隊員、個個竭盡其力、無一不遵守共於比賽之前所授之機宜進行、自始至終、使港方不得片刻安定、勞巴斯托夫居中、勃林基任右內鋒、此位置為勃林基所未素習者、然而勃遵守機宜、其中衛式之前鋒表演、令人滿意、雖在外表上、並不如何悅目、在勝利上、佔有重大之一份也、</p>
<p>在港之舆論、幾乎一致稱贊滬隊表演之較佳、大部份形勢港方佔優然上海能利用每一射門之機會、而絲毫不肯放鬆、在埠際宴中、傑姆起立演説、調“香港指示我人如何踢球、我們則教香港如何射門”、可謂確論、</p>

<h3>貢獻話想到國貨前途</h3>
<p>— 仰弇</p>
<p>國貨在今日，可算舉國都知，舉國能夠服用，試問孩童，也都覺衣食住行，那一件不應服用國貨？不過回過頭來，想想國貨的前途，還未許樂觀，更未許踏到坦平的道上。</p>
<p>第一　去年輸入似乎减少些，可是入超還有二萬萬四千餘萬元，走私的數目，尚不在內，而今年一月份某國貨的輸入數，又打破已往的紀錄，這是如何危險的現象？</p>
<p>第二　國貨的品質，固然改進不少，可是就女訪問員的談話所得，未能滿意的尚不在少數，此後國貨工廠技術方面的精進，以及成本方面的减低都是很重要的事情。</p>
<p>第三　服用國貨的國人，固然不少，可是醉心洋貨，只知以服用舶來品為埋髦的，這種人還多。尤其是受過外洋敎育或高等教育的人為多。怎樣使他們對於國貨的信仰，更加堅强。</p>
<p>第四　儘多內地的國人，欲買國貨而不得，更有外邊的人士，欲買內地的特產土貨而不易購到。可見內外產品的溝通，這項工作，目下還未做到，中國國貨聯合營業公司的使命，怎樣纔能完成。</p>
<p>第五　各地國貨國體，現雖很多，可是大都有名無實，浮面的工作多，而實際的工夫不，形式與理論的宣傳多，而澈底切實的成績少。儘有理論自理論，而事實不是如此的，這是很可憂慮的。</p>
<h3>實行家庭國貨化</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>自從去年我們國貨界發起了家庭訪問，和這一次國貨團體等主辦的新春家庭同樂會後，大家都很深切地感覺到，當前我國每個家庭需要國貨化的必要，的確，家庭是組成整個社會的單位，它是民族，國家的基礎，我們一定要使每個家庭切實的服用國貨，勿用洋貨，這才是發展工商和繁榮國民經濟的先决條件。</p>
<p>不過，“家庭國貨化”，這是一個很空洞的名辭，過去我們提倡國貨者，也曾大聲疾呼過，而現在我們却應進步地要具體提出，家庭到底怎樣使牠實行國貨化，狹義的如何使每個家庭，全用國貨，廣義的如何使每個家庭內自家長，主婦以至孩童僕役，都堅立愛護國產的信心，永遠服用國貨。</p>
<p>在這裏，我的意見以為是，國貨家庭的切實和普遍地推行，主要的動力，當然還在主婦和家長，我們熱望處在目前每個家庭內的主持者，必須富有熱烈愛護國產的正義感，切用品，無論是衣食住行，都應向國貨公司或國貨廠商去採購，譬如布料應用三友或鴻新，綢緞應用美亞，家庭藥品應用五洲，兒童玩具應用康π，日用搪瓷器皿，可購立鶴牌，內衣可購鵝牌，這許多第一流的國貨，必須是每個家庭中日常生活最好的伴侶。</p>
<p>至在另一方面，我又認為為國貨公司，國貨廠商本身，應該隨時布置四貨家庭的鄒型，遍列精美出品，供人參觀，社會上有名人士的推行“家庭國貨化”，更應以身作則，廣為倡導，這也是推進社會上普遍實行國貨家庭的主要力量呢！</p>
<p>提個國貨的呼聲，已響了數年，現下我們唯一希望的，就是每個家庭都國貨化起來。</p>
<h3>我的經騐談</h3>
<p>— 張胡天柱</p>
<p>今年是公務員國貨年，如果全國的公務員眞能個個切實舉行，一年下來，成績一定大有可觀。但是照我的經騐看來，公務員的崇洋心理，實在太深刻了，任是公務員國貨年宣傳的聲浪怎樣高，公務員未必會捨外貨而用國貨。這並不是我的武斷，却是經騐之談。</p>
<p>我曾做過幾個月的公務員，那機關裏二十幾位職員，只有六份之一的職員不用外國貨·其餘六份之五職員，衣食住行，雖不非外貨不</p>
<p>用，却十有九樣是舶來品。而且位置愈高，採用外貨亦愈多，倒是低級職員是眞正提倡國貨者。</p>
<p>公務員“陽奉陰違”的技能，可説高人一等，眞叫人嘆服！在不是公務員國貨年的去年裏，我服務的那個機關，便接到上級機關頒來的訓令，叫機關中全體職員，一律服用國貨，違者懲辦。長官奉到了這個訓令，隨時傳令遵行。但是這位長官，原來是最喜歡仍舶來品的，上面頒來了提倡國貨的命令，雖然傳令所屬遵行，却弄一個變通辦法，説是凡是旣經購置的外國貨，准予照舊應用，以後不得添購。這樣一來，所謂提倡國貨的話，就只有表面上好聽了！因為這些受用外貨的公務員，買了舶來品，儘可以説是早就購置的，橫豎無法稽考。所以像這樣的公務員提倡國貨，實在叫人可歎！</p>
<p>那機關長官對提倡國貨開了方便之門，職員固然可以新買的洋貨説是舊買的。但是究竟不敢公然地買，恐怕長官籍此懲罰。於是叫他們的太太或兄弟出面代購，那就萬無一失了。我因為是女職員，常常到用職員的公館裏去和他們的太太玩，所以知道他們買洋貨的內慕·我曾苦口婆心的勸告他們和她們，終歸無效。反而在言語之間，怪我多事。只有一位科員的太太，給我勸説得明白過來，轉而與她的丈夫交涉，不准他再用外貨。在我離開那機關時，他們夫婦果然已半個月不曾買舶來品了。</p>
<p>那機關裏另外有一個女職員，她把外國貨視同仇讐一般，原因是她的父親從前開糖棧的，起初營業還好，不料後來受洋糖尤其是×國糖傾銷的影響，所進的國糖，價格大跌，結果糖棧倒閉，虧空不貲，她父親竟憂慮身死。她常常對我説：如果不是外貨侵奪了國貨的市場，她怎麼會不幸早歲失怙呢？言下不勝其悽愴者！我聽了也為之一掬同情之淚。噫！可怕的舶來品！</p>
<p>今年是公務員國貨年，我以為宣傳提倡國貨的利害關係，固甚重要。但最重要的，全要機關長官以身作則，並且應該常常對所屬職員明查暗偵，茍有陽奉陰違的便卽革職。這樣辦法，公務員國貨年而沒有成績者，我眞不信。假若上級機關單是一紙訓令，便算是提倡國貨，而下級機關裏的長官職員都陽奉陰違，服用舶來品如故，那就未免笑話了！</p>
<h3>家庭訪問員的一點心得</h3>
<p>一，嫌國貨定價太昂貴。</p>
<p>二，應編印國貨出品目錄並附簡易説明·</p>
<p>三，店員應注意禮貌。</p>
<p>四，關於辨別國貨常識，應注意購物指導。</p>
<p>五，主婦應與廠發生密切關係。鼓勵主婦參觀工廠。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨與救濟失業</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>昨天（二月二十三日）是國際失業節，全世界的失業工人，都組織了請願隊，向政府當局請求給興麺包和生存，這實在是一件值得注意的事。</p>
<p>至於我們中國的失業問題，到現在也眞是越鬧越嚴重了！據民國二十五年某日申報記載僅僅以失業工人的人數而論，已有五百八十餘萬人之多，（智識階級的失業者，還不統計在內）。這又是一件如何值得我們注意的事？</p>
<p>怎樣使失業的人，個個都有服務社會，貢獻能力的機會如何使目前嚴重的失業問題，减少到最低的限度？這不但是政府當當所應負責解决的問題，而且也是社會大眾共同應該注意的問題。</p>
<p>就筆者的愚見看來，我們對於救濟失業的方法，一方面固然希望政府當局，統盤的籌劃一個具體的方案，救濟的計劃；同時，更希望社會上一般有用人之權的大人先生們，在可能範圍之內，酌量的多用人員，使失業的人數，逐漸减少：在另一方面，我们尤其希望全國同胞，大家一致的来提倡國货，服用國货，舉凡一切生活之所需，都以服用國貨為原則。認為服用國貨，是國民應負的義務，應盡的天職，大家都能抱定這個决心，不特國貨事業的前途，可以得到無限的發展，就是一般的國貨工廠，也可因此而出品暢銷，積極擴充，大量生產，在這種情况之下，本來只用二百職工的一所工廠，現在勢非三四百職工，不能應付工作了。全國的國貨工廠，都能這樣，那末，其結果一定會使失業羣中，减少許多的失業者，所謂嚴重的失業問題，也定然可以達到漸漸解决的地步，這是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>所以，筆者深深的覺得，提倡國貨，實在是救濟失業的一個有效方法。服用國貨，的確是一件救己，救人，救國家，救民族的偉大工作。我們要解决這個日趨嚴重的失業問題，要使一般失業的親友，都能服務社會，得到職業的機會。先决問題，還是在乎提倡國貨，服用國貨做起，這是無所用其懷疑與猶豫的。質之諸君，以為何如？</p>

<h3>介紹日本人推銷的四要訣</h3>
<p>— 念芬</p>
<p>推廣國貨發展營業固在乎出品之精美，但優良之推銷方法亦甚重要。日本之所以能稱雄世界，商業發達，卽係推銷手段的高妙所致。大概推廣貿易之要道，總不外乎以攀住顧客為主，務使惠顧者心悅誠服，發生不得不來之潛力，亦卽兵法中所謂攻心為上者也。兹略舉日本人推銷方法數則如下：</p>
<p>一，態度親熱——日本各商店店員在顧客未入店前，先和顏悅色在表示歡迎，如你在店門首稱一逗留，他們便喊着：“請進來”！入店以後，他們請問你需要何物，如有則迅速捧出，且可任意選擇。購物不論多寡，總報以“謝謝”一句。如選擇不中意，則店員必面現愧色，對顧客説：“小號貨品不多，不能使君滿意，實覺抱歉，尚祈原諒”等語。</p>
<p>二，服務周到——日本較大之百貨商店如三越，松板屋，白木屋等，均自備接送汽車多輛，停於車站附近或繁盛市面中心，使顧客得隨時免費乘坐，直駛該店門前，購貨後並有車送至你指定地點，送至指定地點徒，車上之女招待員還臨別贈一句：“謝謝諸君的盛情美意，希望下次再臨小店。”你想這樣買東西還不舒服窩心嗎！</p>
<p>日人對於便利顧客的打算，眞可謂無微不至，除掉上述之汽車接送外，還有代客免費運送包裹品及日常用口每日送貨的兩種辦法。前者因顧念一般顧客有他事不卽回家者，如帶了包裹跑豈不累贅，故而特設運送包裹品車務處，顧客如有包裹，可寫明地點囑該店運送，一定安穩到家，决無掉包貴漏損失之虞，洵極便利也。後者係便利家庭主婦採購每日必需品而設，蓋如米，菜，肉，油，鹽……等開門七件事是每家每日必需品，主婦每天要上街採購一次殊不便利，故是等商店每於清晨派店員乘坐脚踏車前來各戶家詳問一次，如缺少某物，卽可由該店員依所需數量按時送來，且可賒賬，惟每月必須結清耳，如此則主婦不必天天親自出馬有勞跋涉矣。</p>
<p>三，設備完全——各商店範圍稍大者，其店內之設備，必很講究。如設有電梯多架，使顧客得隨時升降。並有休憇室使顧客可以隨時休息，等候親朋家屬。有食堂可以任意點呌經濟飲食，有男女廁所所盥洗室以便顧客大小便。</p>
<p>四，確守信用——日人對於商業貿易上之定期信用，無論對內對外，决不有誤期之慮，例如訂一合同或通知該店於何日交貨，則必先期而貨已製就，决不使顧客有掃興而返之慨。</p>
<h3>婦女服用國貨會的回憶</h3>
<p>— 劍花</p>
<p>二月以前，本市國貨運動聯合會，因鑒於過去的提倡國貨成績，未臻十分滿意，為更求發揚光大起見。邀請了許多婦女界領袖·和不少名人的夫人小姐·開了一個“婦女服用國貨會”，作一次盛大的宣傳，同時還徵集了很多名廠國貨分送來賓，以資鼓勵，因此參加者躋躋一堂，頗極踴躍，作者當時也在被邀之列，除聽到了諸位前輩的名言黨論，還領到了各工廠的精美贈品外。又默察一番會場情形，觀感所及，覺有不能已於言者，本擬早作斯篇，以為我諸姑姊妹告，無如谷務倥偬，未克握管，今兹稍暇，略述所見，幸讀者勿以明日黃花見誚也。</p>
<p>“國貨”在今日，因有諸前輩不遺餘力的“提倡”“勸用”總算已有許多人的腦海裏浮現着那麼一個小小的印象，但也有連甚麼呌做“國貨”，至今猶是“莫名其妙”的，為數尚不在尠，不要説普通婦女界，她們素向抱着買“洋布”“洋襪”“洋傘”……等等的“牢不可破”的心理，自然不知“國貨”為何物，就是智識界婦女，也深深地中了“歐化”“舶來品”……，流毒，於是棉毛織品，脂粉香水，進口的數字，老是有增無减地使人驚心觸目，所以一般人都要把“服用國貨，責在婦女，”這一付重担壓到我們肩頭上來，那的確是無可推諉的。</p>
<p>因此，國運會要專誠地邀集婦女，敦請名人，切切實實的叮嚓勸告：目的在使我們知道“婦女是半數的國民，也應共同担負救國的責任，”“一致服用國貨，也就是救國的要圖”，我們聽了這個敎訓，應當如何“虛心接受”。如何“反躬自省”，並且眞把這重大的責任，担當起來，以救此嚴重的“國難”。（未完）</p>

<p>青年通病</p>
<h3>自凟遺精與發育不全</h3>
<p>若不及早根治則弊害叢生</p>
<p>在春情發動的時期，青年們大多數都躭溺於自凟，因自凟過度而陷於特別襄弱者，頗不乏人。故對於陷入強度自凟弊害之人，施以醫學當議，力説其害，使用有效對癥之藥窮，以消減因自凟與遺精後所引起的一切疾病，如神經衰弱，發育不全等症，實為必要之工作。</p>
<p>青年一旦躭溺自凟，不免精關受損，致遺精頻繁，故一切弊害也接踵而起·根據目前的醫學而論，則證明自凟之害，不僅促成神經的衰弱，他若體質的衰弱，腎部的虧弱，胃腸障碍，局部發育不全，這些都是惡癖的直接影響，或因間接的關係而罹患的。</p>
<p>上述的幾種疾病，差不多為自凟的青年所難免。若不及早治愈，則將來結婚時必妨碍夫婦間的幸福，甚至本來所摧患的病害愈趨惡化。</p>
<p>平常健康者的青年，在過度精神活動之後，通常是性慾減退，但以自凟為習慣者，其結果却是相反，精神過勞就要生遺精，滑精等現象。如在幼小時過度斷傷，那末生殖腺失其繁榮，結果，發育大為不良。</p>
<p>世界著名的性病學家愛斯持蘭氏（A.Tasedalalod　M.D.)對青年病理的遺精症，很有研究，因此造詣深遂·據愛氏説，根治遺精，應用“希米脫氏固精片”治之為最有效。同時兼以生殖腺素製劑“生殖素”以治因自凟遺精所引起的神經衰弱與發育不全。則收效甚速。同時英國的名醫倍利倫博士及美國依豈格博士皆推獎此療法，蓋兩氏用此兩藥治愈青年之遺精症者，數年來從未有一失敗者，因此歐美之醫學界遂衆，一詞的推崇兩名藥之功效，蓋其確實之效果有三：一，秦效迅速而無法弊。二，簡單易行，不感痛苦，三，性質不膩不燥，四季咸宜。且“生殖素”之功效，對於年老力衰者，尤有莫大之助力，因其能幫助體內之各組織回復少壯之氣概，合抵抗疾病之能力增進。故陷於衰老之男婦，如常服“生殖素”，確能恢復少壯時的精力而增加其壽命。種種暮年時的痛苦，可以驟然脫離。</p>
<h3>淋病研究五淋白濁的短期治癒法</h3>
<p>▼……“安敵淋巴確具局部透膜殺菌的威力及全身增加抗淋素的功能</p>
<p>▼……急性期的患者至多旬日左右即可完全治好此為醫生臨床所證實</p>
<p>淋病又名白濁，它不易根治的理由。並非由於病症的特別凶惡，簡單的一句話，實在浚有可靠新方法的發明。試將淋病與梅毒比較，就可以曉得梅毒的凶惡危險，的確勝過淋病數倍，但自六○六發明之後，醫生認為梅毒難治的理由，不復存在。同時淋病治療的困難代替梅毒而居於花柳傳染病的首要地位，由此一端，不難擔測難愈的癥結，並非病的本身，完全為藥物的研究與改進問題，歐美的科學家，深切明瞭，所以對於本症的治療，研究不已，尤其對於藥品的發明，努力尤烈。現在盛行於中外醫界裏的淋病特效藥，首推黃色素和伐克辛合製劑“安敵淋”，因其確具透膜殺菌及增加抵淋素的威力同時不傷腸胃，無任何副作用的流弊。故各國的淋病專家，如德國之白里尼醫學博士，英國之威尼基博士，法國之Scbipan　Hanind.M.D.博士，英之Dr.　Jon　dison　氏，均一致稱道該藥功效之確實，可與六○六的治梅毒成績並駕齊驅，尤其對於治痊不發，最有把握，為一切合製劑的最佳者，此合製劑因效果確實，以前認為淋病的用難之處，服了該藥之後可迎刃而解。</p>
<p>如患者在感染淋病後之急性期內，即服“安敵淋”，至多旬日左右，即可完全治好，並可免傳染於妻子·如若失此機會，淋病就進到次急性期了。此時患者若再疏忽貽誤，誤服劣藥，淋病侵至後部尿道，能惹起後部尿道炎疾病。此外若睪丸腫賬，那就罹患上淋菌性副睪丸炎；淋菌再侵害攝護腺，又惹起淋菌性攝護腺炎病患。故本症若不根治痊癒，眞是為害無窮！如若已傳染妻子，此時夫婦應同服“安敵淋”，女且外用“療帶靈”以除淋病性白帶，依然可澈底根治。</p>
<h3>治療淋病的兩名醫</h3>

<h3>挽救衰老的實踐法</h3>
<p>▼……身體與精神必須兼籌並顧</p>
<p>▼……增强生殖腺為防衰的良法</p>
<p>為挽救衰老、如單注意於身體的衰老，這尚難謂為萬全·蓋精神的衰老，乃為衰老的主因，故有的其身體雖屬衰老，而其精神猶如青年者，世間决非少有。反之，其身體雖屬康健，而其精神異常頹廢者，亦非罕見。由此一點，我們就曉得挽救衰老，必須精神與身體，雙方兼顧，繼可以説是眞正的成功者。</p>
<p>衰老的原因，與吾人身體細胞的活動，及生殖腺的失健，有極大的關係，而對於長毒，生殖腺的繁榮功能，也至為重大。</p>
<p>生殖腺與吾人的衰老，的確有密切的關係，所以如能使生殖腺內分泌永久旺盛，可以預防衰老。或將已衰老之人，服以生殖腺素製劑“生殖素”，那衰弱的生殖腺就可恢復繁榮，其人的肉體與精神，即可返老還童。蓋男用女用“生殖素”，能使男子的睪丸壯盛，女子的卵巢機能增進，這樣之後，衰老者身體的各部器官，皆有適當充分的發青，並能排出體內多量有毒代謝物，幫助中樞神經系統與感覺器官等消滅疲勞，血液旺盛，而且循環得當，可减低年老力衰者身心疲勞的壓迫，因此之故，在中年人服此製劑後，可使青春當留，不易衰老。年高之人，服此之後，能增加全身滋補抗病的力量，故可減去暮年失健時的痛苦。德國著名的生理學家瑪林特博士，及英國名醫威泥基博士等，當用“生殖素”以治愈衰老者，據云：數年來從未有一失敗者，以此觀察。該藥對於挽救衰老的功效，確有驚人的成績。</p>

<p>然而“好死不如惡生”，人們是又誰也賓貴自己的生命，誰也厭惡死神的降臨，他們不斷地為自己的生存而關爭着，他們熱戀着這世界。</p>
<p>現社會上的一切糾紛，爭擾，可以説完全是生與死的戰鬭，大家為了自己生存的利益，就不惜別人的犧牲和死亡，所以，這世界是殘酷的，罪惡的。</p>
<p>雖然，人類的一切文明和進步，也就靠着大家不斷地把自己生命的活力，來和自然及一切戰關勝利的收穫，假使任何人都覺得生之無味，那末，整個的世界就要死去了。</p>
<p>所以我們不能貪生，也不能怕死，在呼吸沒有停止之前，我們是誰也應該努力為自己，為社會，為民族而戰關。我們要繼承着前人沒有跑完的跑道，我們更要為後人而建造更好的境地。</p>
<h3>獵象術</h3>
<p>— 吳冰河</p>
<p>人究竟是聰明的，像象那樣巨大的獸都有方法去捕來來。記得在一張呌做“降龍伏虎”的影片裏，就曾經告訴過我們關於獵象的方法。那就是利用馴象去做“象奸”，將一羣野象誘入預製的圈套內，然後將一隻野象縛在兩隻馴象中間，一一地俘虜回去。看見那巨獸俯首就擒的情態，不禁發起笑來。</p>
<p>然而，仔細思量一下，却處處發現着與這類似的事情，獵象術是隨地被人應用着。像工廠的廠主要想管束工人是不必勞他的駕，祇須化少許錢僱幾個工頭就行。因為工頭的管束工人較廠主更為週到而嚴密，如果廠主認為工人的生產過少，祇須示意工頭，立刻他就會發揮威權，督促工人加倍地去勞作。工頭便是馴象一流的人物。</p>
<p>帝國主義的國家，要想在中國從事經濟的侵略，華買辦是不能缺少的。因為他會告訴他們，關於中國人的風俗，習慣和嗜好，這樣他們生產的商品才能適合中國人的脾胃。華買辦便是與馴象相類的人。</p>
<p>倘使帝國主義的國家，懷着政治上的野心，要想進一步來佔領或統治中國，那挑撥內戰，與以華制華的方法是很有效的。這較他們親自來動手是更為有利。像綏遠戰事中的李守信與王英輩，便是擔負着與馴象相同的任務。</p>
<p>所以文明越進步，人類越聰明，這種利用同類去制同類的獵象術，就會不停地扮演着。</p>
<h3>太倉沙頭鎮之老人會</h3>
<p>— 范顯微</p>
<p>近幾年來，災害頻仍，那不景氣的氛圍，籠罩着整個農村，司農仰屋，十室九空，東也嚷“喫飯難”，西也嚷“吃飯難”這是關於求生方面的：豈知死，現在着實也死不起，衣衾棺槨，在在需錢，倘普通一班家無恒產，又沒有備蓄的人家，突遭家變，橫了個病人下來，實在手足無措，肚腸根恨不得急斷，恨不得把死人醃起來，所以這收殮問題，目前也很感棘手，沒有辦法呀！</p>
<p>我鄉（太倉沙頭）近來有一班有心人，發起一種合於互助性質的會，名呌做老會會，辦法很簡單，不分職業，也不分性別，（大概小輩替長輩儲的，）開始由一個會首鳩集一百個會脚，每會自始至紿，呆板各出一元，不用拈鬮搖彩，又無一定的卸會日期，加入之後，各得證書一紙，以昭信實，會欵存放當地般實商家生息，嗣後逢到會脚中有一個死了，也就是卸第二會之期，當日由會首把前欵提出來界予喪家應用，在七天內，再收集會欵，照樣存放起來，以備下次使用，並且辦法輕鬆爽快，不像舊式老人會的麻煩，因為這種會，收了以後，就算出會，不要再打一個錢了，（如家內再有老年會接續下去亦可）另由會首找一個“新會脚”充當着，所以越是早死，—早收越是便宜，但做小輩的畢竟誰也不願長輩早死的哪！</p>
<p>處農村破產的今日，像這種互助性質的會集，各地着實值得效法的呀！</p>
<h3>吉林人參</h3>
<p>— 梨光</p>
<p>前幾天，家裏來信説，母親身體越發衰弱，要我買點什麼補品回去的話。是的，八十多歲的老人了，應該需要點補品的，什麼補品好呢？於是不期地想到人參，且進而想到吉林的人參了。</p>
<p>人參，在國藥中是補品的上乘，有所謂“高麗參”和“吉林參”，都是以產地區別的。吉林參，是吉林的特產之一，產生於大山林的深處，倘為樹蔭掩蔽而沒有陽光的地方，是不能生長的</p>
<p>人參，是一種多年生草，長到五六十年，而又略似人形的，那就非常可貴。按它生長的程序，可分為六個時期：一年至五年，生一掌狀葉，俗呌“巴掌子”，五年至十年生兩葉，呌“二來子”，廿年生三葉，名“三台子”，三十年生四葉，名“四品葉”，由四十年而至六十年，經過“五品葉”和“六品葉”的時期，天然地長齊了六葉要是根之首尾完整的話，那眞是名貴的東西呀</p>
<p>據説，採參的人，一向是關內冀晋等省的人居多，他們去採參，大約每一二十人組成一小隊，携帶隨身武器，以禦盜或獸的侵襲，宛如探險一般。每隊每人相距百餘步成直綫進行，互相呼應，免失掉聯絡。要是當中一人發現參苗，便大呼“棒槌”，同伴們就問：“什麼棒槌？”，那個發現的視察它的外形，决定屬於那種，卽答“某種棒槌”的時候，大家蜂擁上前，一致大聲喊着“拿”的方法，隨卽以紅線縛着參苗，鋪以油布，用竹刀細心掘取，避免根鬚的損毀，一二日不能了事，則株守不去，待全部取出，陳設祭物，酬謝山神，倘很幸運的，所得為六品葉參，那非用整個羔羊作犧牲品不可的：這種採取法，似乎含有迷信的意味呢。但自東北渝陷後，這採參權，已落到“友邦”人士的掌握中去了。</p>
<p>現滬上各大藥店中的野山參，每兩五六十元，其他最賤的也要十數元不等，這很使我躊躇着。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝　秋光黯翠黛觸景書懷）</p>
<p>小菊送到夢蘭面前，讓他接下，笑道：太太因為找鑰匙開茶櫥十，很躭誤了一些時候。趕快把碟子裝好了，就叫我快些送了來，免得二少奶同小姐老等着。二少奶看那碟子是兩碟西式點心，一碟松子糖，和碟甜梅子。便笑道：我們不過要吃得香香嘴，母親倒把我們當客待。自菊站在一邊道：瓜子花生仁，家裏也都有。太太説，小姐愛乾凈，怕吃得樓上髒，就沒有送來。小姐要嗎？夢蘭笑道：你以為眞是待上賓嗎？説着，回轉頭來向二少奶道：這全是體貼入微的地方。他老人家就知道我所喜歡吃的，不過是幾樣。二少奶道：那自然呵！有個作娘的人，不知道姑娘喜歡什麼的嗎？這話又説回來了。作姑娘的人，對於母親，也是一樣呀。夢蘭呆了一呆，歎口氣道：若説到這層，我就是個罪人。我雖然知道母親的脾氣，我可不能替他分憂解愁。説句更踏實一點的話，增加他的煩惱不少了。二少奶取了一塊松子糖，三個指頭夾着，慢慢見的送到嘴裏去咀嚼。只是望了夢蘭，却不肯從中安挿一個字下去。夢蘭看了他吃糖，也取了一塊在手，但是還不曾送到口裏去吃，却又放下來了。因道：父母待我都是慈愛極了。説到這裏，卻唉的聲長嘆了一口氣。二少奶笑道：旣是父母全喜歡你，這是好事，為什麼妹妹倒歎起氣來了。夢蘭道：我並不是説父母不該疼愛我，只是白疼了。二少奶道：這話怎麼説，我倒有些不懂。夢蘭道：二嫂，你眞要我説，我就説出來罷。我就為了婚姻不自由，感到處處都不如意。也就為了這一層，常讓兩位老人家放心不下。要説我一點表示沒有，和那些舊家庭的小姐一樣，一切含糊過去，我又辦不到。二少奶道：旣是妹妹知道了，你何不就將就父親母親一點意思呢？夢蘭低着頭，又歎了一口氣。二少奶這時已把那塊松子糖吃下去了。接着又起身取了一塊松子糖在手，緩緩的送到口裏咀嚼着。當他送到口裏去咀嚼的時候，兩隻眼睛，依然向夢蘭偷睃了幾下，見他始終是微低了頭作個憂鬱不言的樣子。便笑道：這是姑嫂倆閑談，無所不言的話，你旣然知道這種情形，為什麼不轉轉彎呢。夢蘭微微的歎了一口氣，搖了兩搖頭道：這話是很難説的·二少奶笑道：我們無非是閑談，管他難不難？你且説説看。（一三七）</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>回力球塲素描</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>晚上，電炬像火山似的爆發了。霓虹燈的光熖在市招上流動着，像熱情少婦的眼珠子，誘惑着行人·光滑的柏油馬路中間，蛇樣的電車，野獸似的公共汽車，大青蛙般的流綫型摩托卡，在忙碌地游泳着。</p>
<p>在亞爾培路回力球場門口，擠着許多人，鈴…鈴…鈴…一陣一陣的，尖銳的賣票鈴聲，從窗口里透出來，蕩漾在沉黑的街頭，它沉重地敲在每一個人的心上，使那些球迷者的心，也一回兒緊張，一回兒弛鬆。八點敲過了。我跟着眾人走進了門口。</p>
<p>場子裏，挨著次序的坐滿了中外各色的男女，但他們都靜悄悄地，沒有一些喧曄，卽偶爾有人同隣座者在談話，也是那樣低聲悄氣的·大家全伸長着勃子，把那銳利的視綫集中在那個白色的球上，和穿着紅藍衣服的球員身上·看他們忙碌地在那廣場里面的電燈光下奔跑着，將那白色的球用力地抽在墻上，又抽在地下，接着終終回到了他們的手中。</p>
<p>又是一次用力打了出去，但是對方沒有人接住，另一個球員却跑了上來。那時，人叢裏忽然轟起了一陣鼓噪：</p>
<p>“亞爾培地呀！今天亞爾培地又打了個四分！”我隨着那叫喊的聲音，向一級一級的高看臺上望去，却看見我的斜對面正有兩個青年紳士在發狂似的叫。</p>
<p>“眞的呵，亞爾培地又出了兩次哪！”結果，又是亞爾培地勝利了。於是立刻，看臺上的人羣裏面起了一種普遍的歡呼和太息聲，甚至有些人竟從座位上爬了起來，衝到了領錢的地方去；也有的是憤憤的把那紅綠色的票子，撕成了粉碎，丟在角落里了</p>
<p>下一次的賣票鈴聲又在鈴…鈴…鈴…地響着丁。那些人又把一元的，五元的十洋的法幣遞到了那賣票人的手裏；同時却欣欣然的換到了一張張紅綠色的票子，大家都把一個希望也寄託到了那張票子的號碼上。</p>
<p>“二號好呢，還是亞爾培地吧！他今天兩趟獨贏，説不定第三次還是他呢？”</p>
<p>“也許，亞爾培地走了紅運………………”</p>
<p>一次，兩次，三次……比賽着，比賽着。得意的，儘把臉抬得高高地，心里像喝過了一杯葡萄酒般的那麼舒服。失敗時，儘把腦袋沉下去，心裏像呷過了一碗鹽滷似的難過。座位上，浮動着許多活躍的，憂慮的眼珠子。</p>
<p>那些西班牙的選乎漸漸地在眼前消失了，場裏面，只有留着那最後的無綫電晚樂，還在播送行曲，人羣，密密地擁擠着向門口流去，帶着得意的笑語和失望的嘆息，衝上了那條褐色的死蛇似地長街。</p>
<h3>談曆（下）</h3>
<p>— 曹義璇</p>
<p>此案為攝影機王伊斯德曼為後援，宣傳於各國的。伊氏死後，此案亦隨之而消滅。五一九二九年俄國又定五日為一星期，廢止原來的休息日，大凡休息的日，依勞動者事務員的色彩而不同，譬如赤色為一·六日，綠色為二·七日，黃色為三·九日。與從前以星期日為休息日的歐洲風大異。可是實施這制度以後，一家族中夫與妻子的休息日，往往皆不同，所以不能團聚家庭的樂·俄政府漸悟此弊，乃改六日為一星期，以六，十二，十八，二十四，三十為休息日，若在這日不休息的人，可在六日間休息一日，報館除了中央機關報外，全部於此日休刊，惟二月因無三十日，以三月一日為休息日，這是俄政府從反宗教的立場，特意廢止七日星期制的·現今以美國為中心代康德案，最為妥當，這案於一九○九三年由德國芳奇哈爾得所提議，把一年分為四季，各季有三十一日，三十日，三十日三個月，餘下的日，置在年終，閏日亦為星期外的日，附於六月的末，如以一月一日為星期日，那末四季的第一個月的一日，亦為星期日，第一個月的一日為星期三，第一個月的一日為星期五，永久不變，就是曆日與星期日的關係，祇有三種，很容易推算的。列表如下：</p>
<p>以上為芳奇哈爾得所考案的世界曆，便與星期分離，每月平均的日數亦妥，此案將來必為全世界所採用，因為們所用的星期，係本於古代猶太的傳統與埃及的迷信，在歐美不能廢止的理由，是受了基督教與猶太教徒的反對，其在我國，本來無關緊要的。所説這世曆，到了一九三九年，民國二十八年的一月一日，適為星期日，恐怕到了那年，就可實施，然而世界的輿論，究竟怎樣動向，很可注意的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>開放言論</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>蔣委員長前日發表談話，列舉三點，昭示國人，一開放言論，二集中人才，三赦免政犯，足徵蔣委員長偉大之精神，和公開的態度，面對於開放言論一層，除宣傳赤化，危害國家，及洩漏軍事外交秘密，興不根事實，故造謠言三點，絕對禁止外，一致尊重合法之言論自由，此種意思，是人民渴望的意思，也是筆者數年迭次伸訴，而未曾到達目的的意思，今於三中全會開會之時，竟將此種人民願望，完全付予，此固不能不馨香祝禱者。</p>
<p>夫限制言論自由，在此訓政時期，原為中央不得已之舉措，且為限制言論自由，而當局代受言論界之責任與指摘，亦必非當局所願為，假定言論界無龐雜的思想,與不負責任的言論，則言論之開放,政府亦決不加以限制，政府出其高壓手段以箝制輿論，原出於不得已，然做一個新聞記者，應該曉得自己對於言論的責任，及人格的修養，故對於謀害國家漏洩秘密及不符事實等事，本來應該由記者負責。</p>
<p>自檢查制度實行，而一切言論新聞，應否披露的責任，多付與檢查者之手，檢查員為鄭重其責任起見，故其檢查報紙，往往超越中央所規定之範圍，而新聞記者對於檢查者過於認真，過於審愼，則非難之聲，不免有時而起，因此檢查者地位之困難，較諸新聞記者而更難，失之于寬，則不免受中央當局之譴責，失之於嚴，則不免受新聞記者之責言，故檢查員左右為難之苦衷，誠無以自白，而新聞記者對於報紙之言論，雖有噤若寒蟬之苦，其責任則自有所歸矣</p>
<p>倘若政府明定範圍，提出原則，則新聞記者自應遵照原則辦理，卽不必使檢查員為難，而新聞記者亦自應對於中央而絕對負責，否則檢查員與新聞記者，未能明瞭當局者之意旨，在檢查方面，不應檢查者而亦加以檢查，在新聞記者方面，卽應該發表者而亦不敢發表，而其結果，報紙一無足觀，而中央乃任其箝制輿論之咎，此亦當局者之寃也。</p>
<p>惟推究取締新聞之本旨，無非防止反動，與不負責任之言論而已，然此種辦法，僅能為消極之箝制，而决不能為積極的利用，夫報紙的天職，本來有所謂監督政府，與指導人民的美名，此種説話，本來是旁人恭維新聞記者的語調，不足為據，而其實報紙本不足以監督政府，但對於政府之措施，用意雖善，而運用之間，不無流弊與隔閡之處，新聞記者見聞較切，自應作善意的貢獻，而民間所有疾苦，當局容有未知，知之而未能確切者，新聞記者亦應當為民作舌，而為之伸訴，此原為記者之責任也，若恐觸犯政府之忌諱，難逃譴責，於是應言者亦不敢言，應發表者亦不敢發表，此非特記者之自失天職，而亦决非當局對於言論界之本旨也。</p>
<h3>今年是“怪”年</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>不知什末時候起，每年都有一個特定的名稱，來表示這一年的特色，譬如“婦女國貨年，”“兒童年，”“雜誌年，“市民國貨年，”等等都是。當然，今年也不能免俗，年才過了不到兩個月，“年”的號稱已相當多了，如由“國貨年”一脈而來的“公務員國貨年，”如和“雜誌年”有同等意義的“戲劇年，”又如有積極的愛國意味的“收復失地年，”甚至以屬肖為號的“牛年”等，已數不盡數，不過，我們以為今年還可以呌做“怪”年。</p>
<p>關於“怪”，相信凡曾閱報的人都會知道；而每日閱報的人更會非常熟悉。而這些“怪”者，今年尚算新發現，但發現之多，實在也太“怪”了。下面是一個小小的關於“怪”的統計：</p>
<p>一月一日未刻，楊林等海口，發現“怪”艦十艘，用輕機關槍向灘外掃射半小時始停。二日晨十一時，突有“怪”機飛青島市上空，擲下各種傳單，內容措詞極荒謬，盤旋約廿分鐘之久始離去。同日午后常熱七區沙洲市中心港到“怪”艦一艘，測量水位，並有“怪”水兵數人登岸。八日九日鈞有“怪”機飛津南青縣，滄縣，靜海，及冀南大名，永清，石家莊等，投擲荒謬傳單。十九日南京中央社電：外交部因常有“怪”機任意飛濟，頃再提嚴重抗議。廿一日晨，“怪”機一架在津盤旋甚久，旋向西北飛去。同日平市上空也發現“怪”機。二十九日夜間七時後，突有“怪”艦一艘往返白茆口與高浦口間，用探海燈向岸上照射。同日有“怪”輪一艘在青島附近有走私嫌疑不受巡海關艦搜查。卅日午前十一時十五分又有五○二號及一四○號兩“怪”軍用機飛青島旦降落於滄口機場。</p>
<p>以上所錄光是一月份怪機怪艦在我國領土的出現，已達十宗，平均三日一宗，這不可説不多了。而且還有在鄭州破獲有組織有背景的“怪”機關一所，還不算在內，至於二月份，在上半月頗算甯靜，但是一至下半月，“怪”又告活躍了。</p>
<p>二月份截至个天（廿二）止，共有五宗。計開：十八日晚七時半平市上空發現“怪”機一架，兩翼及機尾均有黃綠色燈向下照射，低飛盤旋歷十五分鐘始向西市飛去。十九日晚九時許，保定亦發現“怪”機，用探海燈向下照射。廿日午前，十時廿五分有“怪”機由大連飛抵青島。又同日午前十一時四十分，“怪”軍用機一一零三號由津抵青，旋又飛津。又同日下午五時，常熟六區自茆口，又發現“怪艦”，向灘外開放機關槍掃射歷十分鐘。</p>
<p>領土是中國的領土，而可以隨便有軍用機降落，甚至軍艦在內河行駛且開輕機關向岸上掃射，這不單止該“機”該“艦”可説是“怪”，而此等事情也不能不説是“怪”事了。但是，很像類此的“怪”事發生在我國便不怪似的。我們不看嗎？兩月未到竟有十五宗，其中同日發生的且有三宗之多，這不是“怪”已不怪了嗎？同時，所謂“怪”也者，更有登堂人室的神氣，譬如在青島，從前是出現於上空，如今且居然降落，這不能不説是“怪”而又“怪”了。</p>
<p>今年才去六分一，“怪”事已如此多，以後更何堪設想？今年不是“怪”年，又是什末？不過，“怪”事太多總不大妙，但願憑了我們“統一”了的力量，把“怪”年的名字取消才好。</p>
<h3>面孔大掃除</h3>
<p>— 日新</p>
<p>居室或者道路，假使塵垢堆積，就要舉行大掃除，以恢復它的清潔。</p>
<p>粉刺雀斑，油光黯氣，……這些佈滿在人們的臉上，就和塵垢堆積在道路上是一樣的難看！</p>
<p>這原因是對於皮膚不善保護，或者使用了不合宜的潤面品；所以要想恢復面孔的清潔，必須有效的澈底的大掃除一下。</p>
<p>第“一”流的雪花霜“一品香”，係選用高貴的藥料配製而成，具有專門的藥劑功效，能夠把面孔上的斑痕皺紋，油光暗氣，一掃而空。并且久用還能使毛孔細小，膚色白嫩，男女都是非常適合的呢。（一品香是五洲藥房的出品）</p>
<h3>殭屍出現？</h3>
<p>— 劉尚義</p>
<p>最近吳淞張華浜田野內，發現一個十三年未腐的女屍，迷信者遂目為祟人的殭屍，甚至謡傳晚間出現，這實在很是可笑。</p>
<p>記得從前我住在鄉下的時候，也有謠傳出現了殭屍，鄰人某竟説他親眼見過，對我細述那殭屍的模樣，動作，歷歷如繪，害得我夜晚不能安眠，常覺黑暗中鬼影憧憧，後來祇得搬住到城裹，原來我那時候患着很利害的神經衰弱症。</p>
<p>現在我的身體壯健，精神勝常，宿疾全消，因為我每天調服“地球牌麥精魚肝油”，所以有偉大的滋補效力，想起從前怛怯的情形，眞是前後判若兩人了。</p>

<h3>胡塗</h3>
<p>— 落</p>
<p>同事胡穀天現在被大家呌做胡塗了：穀天這名字反而漸漸生疏起來。然而胡穀天先生并不像這個綽號那樣糊塗，並且他在同事中最精警，聰明的一個，為人又和靄可親：胡塗綽號的由來，有這樣一段故事：</p>
<p>胡穀天先生有一位女友，已經進展到論嫁娶的階段了。一個星期六的上午，那位小姐打電話給胡穀天先生約他看電影，自然胡穀天先生是答應了的。但是到散寫字間的時候，胡穀天先生竟一時糊塗起來，忘了那個最可愛的約會。更不幸的，那位小姐發現了胡穀天先生和另外一位女友在某處喝茶，就在星期六當天。事情就這樣完了蛋，雖然我們的胡先生曾寫了很長的一封信向她解釋，結果胡穀天先生失戀了。</p>
<p>在一羣年青的同事中，對於戀愛事件自然是最好的談話資料，那時候起胡穀天先生就被呌做胡塗了。</p>
<p>現在我們就稱他胡塗先生吧。胡塗光生經此事變，當然頗有些鬱鬱不歡的樣子。他的最知己的同事朱，大概受了那些章回小説的遺毒吧，暗中把恢復胡塗先生和那位小姐的愛情底責任慷慨地担負起來，他想完成一件驚天動地的大俠的故事，他向人自詡是啼笑因緣中的關壽峯。</p>
<p>寫字間里自然熱鬧起來，胡塗先生的故事像文明戲一樣被同事們編了一個“二美奪夫”的劇本，由幾個最好動的同事在電話間里串演。在飯後的休息時間，用一塊木牌寫了些“本團特請胡塗先生排演二美奪夫”等字樣，作為廣告。</p>
<p>這樣毫無顧忌的胡鬧，胡塗先生常當顯得不安於室，在休息的時間內他不敢逗留在寫字間里，他孤獨地到馬路上去散步，或到外灘公園獃坐着出神。俠客關壽峯認為他行俠的時間成熟了，他追隨着胡塗先生，他同情胡塗先生的境遇，他慷概激昂辱罵同事們的無義無恥，他又鼓勵胡塗先生在戀愛的途上是應該勇往直前的，應該用愛國的精神去斬掉阻止前進的荊棘，這樣勇敢得來的勝利才是眞正的勝利！因而同事朱探得了那天和胡塗先生在一起喝茶的，是胡塗先生的小姑母。於是大俠關壽峯在寫字問里得意起來，要完成這件驚天動地的故事，最後一步是去探望胡塗先生的女友，在他意料之中這又是最容易解决的。</p>
<p>但是在關壽峯沒有大功告完的時候，胡塗先生和那位女友已言歸於好了，那消息又在頑皮的同事在電話間里竊聽來的。</p>
<p>寫字間里的情形當然又是一變，那些小丑們已經鼓不起精神來排演“二美奪夫”的喜劇了，他們反而覺得對胡塗先生抱歉似的。同事朱同樣感到慚愧，他耗費了精神，時日，最後的大功還是讓胡塗先生破壞了。</p>
<p>寫字間里暫時平靜下來，等着，讓誰再來串演一次好戲。</p>
<p>我忽然想起“天地大戲場，戲場小天地”的一付草臺班上的對聯來，這個世界的每個角落里都是一個獨立的小戲場，胡塗先生的戀愛事件本來與第三者絲毫沒有關係的，但是人類生下來好像就派定了要來演戲，於是就有小丑們來排演“二美奪夫”，就有同事朱的關壽峯出來仗義行俠，胡塗先生也硬拉他來担任這劇中的正派小生了。</p>
<p>記得有人説過：“演戲的傻子，看戲的是獃子”，在“天地大戲場”中，恐怕就祇有這二種人類吧。</p>

<p>多情寳玉意無聊。探望林姑把悶消。來到瀟湘真寂寞。那紫鵑，廊前獨坐態多嬌。忙忙叩問姑娘病。紫鵑道，咳嗽稍痊莫記牢。寳玉是、雙手向她胸口抹。説道、衣衫單薄病魔招。紫鵑是，咬牙切齒心頭恨。駡一聲，莫再胡行在我曹。人言可畏要説輕佻。姑娘見你恐將身避。話罷一番往內室跑。今朝公子遭奚落。心同如冷水澆。一出館門魂魄奪。坐在那，假山石上淚雙抛。痴情一片書獃子。思慮縱横如怒潮。午餐不進憤難消。雪雁，被二爺趕逐心奇怪。來請紫鵑走一遭。行到石邊開口説。爲怎麽、二爺呆坐兼號啕。説道、你們與我都疏遠。百轉回腸意苦焦。紫鵑道，姑娘明歳回鄉里。與吾們，二地睽違道路迢。寳玉道，姊姊爲何多謊話。妹妹的，家中親屬實寥寥。紫鵑説。賈應雖然門第大。但是，這林家世代也淸高。異日姑娘須出閣。到明年，他家一定派人邀。你妹妹與奴親口講。她與你，雙方表記總徒勞。那寳玉，好似青天來霹靂。穿心萬箭急難煞。回轉怡䒺大病遭。</p>

<p>開篇「十二月花名」</p>
<p>艶陽春動百花鮮。酒肆旗挑村杏前。杜甫遊春桃李茂。吟詩把酒可稱仙。夢梅折柳傳佳話。牡丹亭中會嬋娟。花護石榴鍾進士。端陽佳節競龍船。范蠡曾貢西施女。西子吳王共採蓮。織女牛郎會七夕。鳯仙花對鵲橋邊。丹桂飄香人人喜。月裏嫦娥愛少年。陶潛公心愛籬邊菊。重九登高心翩翩。貴妃醉酒沉香榻。羞得芙蓉色不妍。雪花堆足藍關道。曾渡文公馬不前。莫道重冬無古節。也有那，踏雪尋梅孟浩然。這纔是，一年各有好花妍。</p>

<h3>漢奸無惡不作</h3>
<p>我國的國難，雖然造成的原因很多，但漢奸作孽的結果，也是一個大原因，所以漢奸是禍國害國的大罪人！</p>
<p>在天一新片「王先生生財有道」里，導演左明用許多幽默的手法，暴露了一個漢奸的生活，他走私歛錢，高利搜刮，壓廹小市民，調戲女招待，玩弄嚮導員，欺，詐，敲，騙，簡直無惡不作，使得觀衆看了可以有「去惡疾仇」之心，這在國防意義上，無疑可以得着很高的評價的。</p>
<h3>「神秘之花」開拍中</h3>
<p>藝華潘孑農所編之「神秘之花」一劇，係寫一個活潑美貌的女郎，被社會中的一般混蛋們掌握着，他們把她當作摇錢樹，來顛倒富紳，官吏，新聞記者，做出了一番烈烈轟轟的驚人事件來，這個女郎就是劇中的「神秘之花」。</p>
<p>「神秘之花」由岳楓導演，開拍已數日，第一天拍戲的男女主角白楊，王乃東，馬陋芬，秦桐，姜修等均甚興奮。</p>
<p>「神秘之花」中的神秘女郎嚴紫薇，由白楊担任演出，這一個角色，對於她的個性很適合，白楊已往在銀台上已有很好的成績，這次在這個劇的演出，一定是更有可觀。</p>
<p>「神秘之花」中，王乃東飾一個壞蛋首領，戲十分吃重，馬陋芬是一個新聞記者，秦桐是富紳，姜修是一個護軍使，關宏達是一個少爺，梁篤生是一個拆白助手，都有緊張的鏡頭。</p>

<h3>平民的「當當生活」</h3>
<p>藝術是大衆的，藝術應該描寫大衆的生活，天一新片「富貴榮華」里，便有着許多描寫大衆痛苦生活的情况。</p>
<p>平民在不景氣的時代，時刻逼得過着當當的生活；「富貴榮華」里的笑匠葛福榮，翁世榮二位仁兄，他們便是過當當生活的，他們要當衣服，要當破傘，要當套鞋，要當舖蓋，没得當的，甚至於連一面破鏡子也要當，把貧窮人痛苦生活，深刻地描畫出來了。</p>
<h3>並未放棄「黑地獄」</h3>
<p>編者先者：前天（二十二日）貴欄有劇運綫上一項的劇社消息紀載，第一叚爲敝社的消息，在這事實上有很不相符的錯誤。敝社排演之「黑地獄」，該劇原作者凌鶴先生並没説過不同意，而且也並未放棄該劇，兹因社會局審查方面未得正式通過，而也爲了愼重該劇一切技術上的完美起見而作爲第二次演出，現改首次演出曹禺先生之「日出」，特請更正，並祝撰安。一九三七劇社啟。</p>

<h3>霧中駕駛新術</h3>
<p>— 爲</p>
<p>每年給汽車駕駛以較大威脅的就是霧。這並不是因了霧的本身壞到怎樣地步。更不是因了車燈的設計者有什麼錯誤。而是因了駕駛者每天在各種天氣中施用他們的汽車。</p>
<p>事實上能使各種交通完全停頓也是霧。能安心向前駛行的只有依靠路軌的車輛。也只有在這種大霧氣候中汽車駕駛員纔能領悟軌道的價值。他可把這些軌道當他的嚮導。如果他是個膽胠者。那末可跟隨在一輛電車的後面。一直到他的目的地。</p>
<p>駕車依着熟路回家去。把沿路的記號記在心中。也可有助於心惶手亂的時候。普通的店家房屋那時也許完全不見。把路面的變化記住。如路的傾斜度和灣曲。都不無小助。可是路的灣曲。不是永遠可靠。因為霧中駛車的速率比較的慢些。况且有時雖已轉了灣而自己會不覺得的。一種高密度的霧非但把幾碼外的事物。使人完全不見。就是所發的聲浪。也被牠罩住了。因此駕駛的危險當然增加得多。</p>
<p>有些駕駛者甚至在比較輕薄的霧中。就不能找到他們的路綫。這一部份是因他們缺乏信心。又一部份是因採用不合式的車燈。對於這件事。我們只願説一句話。如果你覺得有些危險。把你的汽車放在你所經過的第一家汽車行裏。步行回家。或者有公用車輛的話。就搭公用車回家。</p>
<p>頭燈在霧中是沒有多大用處的。减少尋常的燈光。並且只用側燈和特種的霧燈。這兩種燈各有各的優點。所以有些人主張用其中的一種。還有些人主張用另一種。都不免偏軌。無論採用那一種燈。光綫總要向下射面完全沒有向上輝耀。向上輝耀的光綫會把我們視綫混糊面和停在霧中的水點反射過來。這也就是頭燈所以無用的原因。側燈的光過強了。也會產生上述同樣的惡果。光綫完全向下。那末我們在這光潭中可以辨視當前的事物。</p>
<p>霧燈最好裝二只。一只裝在近邊道的一面。光綫向邊道。離車前僅數尺。另一只裝在中央或靠路中心的一面。光綫向前。這二只燈裝得越低越好。如果不能裝在保險槓下面。那末就裝在牠的上面前窗是非開不行的。雖然我們覺得不舒服。因為窗開了。我們的視綫可以增加幾尺。霧似乎停止在窗的外面。成為一種朦朧不明的障屏。</p>
<h3>一九三七年式新車安全設備（續）</h3>
<p>— 韻陵</p>
<p>準是以觀。一九三七年式新車於安全一層。實已遠勝曩昔。而汽車製造工程師之竭其腦力。以為乘客謀者。亦可謂忠且盡矣。雖然。凡事均有進展之中。今之所視為盡善者。異日或鄙視之。今日未獲實現者。他日或補充之。故汽車安全之進步亦無止境。研究此道者日在埋首苦幹之中耳。今日我人所見之汽車。轎式車者固封閉甚密。但通體則作流綫型。其通風方法且不用“通風”。身之重心下移。彈簧懸置進步多多。車車之震顫。似已一掃而空。凡兹種種。在乘坐之安全上。竟令觸摸或聞察其聲息。以為車行速率之探考者。已失其效用。此其進步。無或否認者也。因乘坐之舒適。能令乘車者减少疲乏。此言甚確。但亦有一種人。以為如是則縱在絕駛或放狂之行車時。勢亦將令乘車者無從體騐其危險。此雖過甚之詞。但新車之行駛穩適。由可知矣。</p>
<p>今後汽車在安全方面之設備。其設想之週全。更可由眼前所見者推定之。兹姑舉一端。以概其餘。一九二七年式新車。關於車廂內部各尖銳部份。及凸出部份。都加以光磨或改成圓體狀。錶版及門球柄等力求光滑。鍵門及小巧物件大都隱藏壁板中。俾車行時突然煞車或震撞時。車中人不致因撞及尖銳物而發生巨禍。今後汽車製造如再進步。勢必將車內外一切尖銳式凸出物件悉數摒除。並在錶版加以墊套等之柔性園衣。以保確切之安全。</p>
<p>制動器與車輪胎在安全方面有互相為用之妙。今之不滑溜車胎及巨力制動器等。在製作方面可謂已經登峰造極。制動器與車胎今能在一綫之地。立刻停車。效用至鉅。所不能免者。當車行急濾停止時。車中乘客難保不受震驚。於是有機力式制動方法。庶幾此弊可免。此項方法之原理。係根據距離與壓力之大小。而使用制動器。不必用大力施之制動機始得獲效也。此項新式裝置。於公共汽車及私人用車上。已頗有用之者。此外尚有撤沙器以防止滑溜。及飛機上用之吊帶等。汽車亦有使用之者，均能增加安全乘用之效率者也、偏光燈制之效用。兹亦將次完成。大概不久以後。各車均將採用耳。</p>
<p>車前端之檔泥板目下均係鋼料所製。他日為更求安全起見。或將以橡皮料代之。則遇發生意外事件時。可减少危險之成份也。又車之四週。為保險不受碰撞。亦將以肋狀條等環繞全車。將來汽車之最大革新。可為我人所預料者。厥為引擊之移於車後部。而將駕駛座設於車之最前端。許多工程師云。此種改造不僅為製造上自然的趨勢。且亦足以保障安全。因目下駕駛者離車首最前端往往有五六尺之地位。車行縱極快速過度。每不覺其危險之已甚。如能在車之最前端駕駛。則路上景像歷歷在目。得更清晰。自不願有過度之速度。以性命為嘗試矣。總之。汽車之安全設備。漫無止境。將與日俱進。而令乘坐者咸得十分之滿意也。</p>

<h3>Going to Bailing Temple (3)</h3>
<p>— Our reporter Qian Hua</p>
<p>More than a hundred miles of uninhabited Mongolian grassland - Life of generals and soldiers on the snowy frontier outside the Great Wall</p>
<p>Indeed, as Yuan Qiu Chuji's poem says, "There are no trees on the ground, only desolate grass, and the heaven produces mounds to submerge the mountains." Here, the car speeds up, crashing straight ahead as if entering a no-man's land. All that can be seen along the way are scattered herds of cattle and sheep. For more than a hundred miles, there are no villages or human habitation. The climate here is even colder. The north wind roars, and the exposed skin on the face is numb with cold. Breathing becomes a little rapid, and it is unbearable. Everyone puts the remaining old sheepskin cloaks on their heads and hugs each other for warmth. The lively atmosphere on the car with talking, laughing, and singing is threatened by the extreme cold and suddenly becomes silent. Only the sound of the wheels rolling and the flying dust behind the car can be heard. After traveling like this for more than two hours, we opened our eyes and saw only highlands and grasslands. There was nothing, just like sailing in the Pacific Ocean. The water vapor we breathed out formed crushed ice on the leather collars of our coats, and the tall captain with a small mustache also had ice flowers on his mustache. Everyone looked at each other and smiled bitterly, still without saying a word. At half past four, the mountain peaks outside Bailing Temple could be seen in the distance. A cheer sounded like Columbus discovering the New World. We struggled to muster the last bit of courage and sang the triumphal military song. Everyone's faces lit up, and suddenly the car drove to the foot of the mountain. More than a dozen sentries from the national defense front ran over and asked a few questions. Two stood on the side of the car, and the rest led the way in front of the car. The wheels slowly crossed several extremely tight defense lines like cattle, and drove into the mountain pass. The Bailing Temple on the national defense front suddenly appeared before us.</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>Octagonal architecture</p>
<p>We drove straight to the Bailing Temple and got out of the car. Here, there are many solemn and splendid Tibetan-style pagodas with white and gold edges. Looking at the large monasteries one by one, the outside is painted snow-white, and the reflected color in the twilight surrounded by hills is even stronger. It gives distant travelers a mysterious concept that is unbelievable. Sun Lanfeng's brigade, which captured Bailing Temple, is currently stationed there. Brigade Commander Sun went to Sui on official business, and Chief of Staff Yuan Qingrong came out to welcome us on his behalf. He roughly guided us around for a week. Next to the Lama Temple are the small courtyards where the Lamas live. Each courtyard is the same size, the same structure, and the same alleys. Turning around and around, it seems like the original place. Chief of Staff Yuan said that this was built by the Lamas according to the Bagua diagram. People who come here for the first time cannot return to their original residence once they go out without a Lama to lead them. Our brothers suffered unspeakably for the first few days when we first arrived here. We always made the joke of getting lost several times a day. Now that we are familiar with it, and each house has different markings on the outside, we will never have any problems again. However, you must be especially careful when you first come here. Do not blindly bump around alone. Then we were led into a slightly larger courtyard, divided into front and rear courtyards. On the wall of the main house in the rear courtyard, there are painted Buddha statues, and defensive fortifications are built in the courtyard. Our group stepped into the room. The three upper rooms were cleaned very cleanly, and the innermost one was paved with a floor and equipped with the latest Japanese coal-saving stove. Two large gasoline barrels were piled in the corner. The black barrels were painted with the white letters "Manchuria Aviation Co., Ltd." This shocking arrangement made everyone feel even more uneasy about the mysterious concept they had accumulated in their hearts. Chief of Staff Yuan said excitedly that this was the residence of Major General Shengdao, the head of the Japanese special service agency who used to be stationed in Bailing Temple. Now he is following De Wang, not leaving him for a moment. Most of the various aggressive conspiracies are planned by him. He has lived in Inner and Outer Mongolia for more than 20 years, married a Mongolian wife, speaks fluent Mongolian, and knows everything about Mongolia. He is truly a Mongolia expert. For more than 30 years, he has been spreading the seeds of aggression at all times and in various classes, so his power has been deeply rooted. In recent years, he has trained many Japanese ronin to go deep into various parts of Inner Mongolia, inciting autonomy and doing various disruptive work. He is the culprit of this war. An hour before we captured Bailing Temple, he escaped by car, sacrificing only his most trusted assistant, Colonel XX. Cutting off his beard and abandoning his robe was enough to preserve our face. Yuan excitedly spoke with gestures, and a group of listeners could not help but be fascinated. The excited psychology made the expressions on everyone's faces a little different.</p>

<h3>German Foreign Minister Visits Austria</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The visit of a diplomatic representative to a friendly country is generally due to one of two reasons. One is that the relations between the two countries are already very good. However, in order to further enhance friendly relations, envoys are sent to each other. The result of such an exchange is of course to further enhance the close relationship between the two countries. The other is that the relationship between the two countries has not reached a friendly level, or the opinions of the two countries on certain issues are not consistent. Therefore, envoys are sent to each other to explain misunderstandings, reconcile opinions, and discuss important issues between them. The result of such an exchange can sometimes lead to good results and enhance friendly relations between the two countries, while at other times it will be fruitless and the visiting representatives will return disappointed.</p>
<p>Which type of visit does this visit of German Foreign Minister Neurath to Austria belong to? We would rather say it is the latter than the former. Although Germany and Austria signed a good-neighborly agreement last July, which eliminated past conflicts and misunderstandings and entered into a friendly relationship, the source of conflict between the two countries has not been removed. Last year's good-neighborly agreement only temporarily eased the serious conflict between the two countries. Therefore, although the relationship between the two countries has improved considerably on the surface since the signing of the good-neighborly agreement, such as the elimination of the power of the extremely pro-Italian Heimwehr and the inclusion of pro-German figures in the cabinet, in reality the conflict between the two countries has increased rather than decreased. Behind this dispute is, of course, the relationship with Italy. This cannot be denied. Although the relationship between Germany and Italy has greatly improved as a result of Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Germany and General Goering's reciprocal visit to Rome, the conflict between the two countries over Central European interests cannot be completely eliminated.</p>
<p>We can clearly see the recent conflict between Germany and Austria from the speech given by Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg to 1,500 leaders of the Patriotic Front on the 14th. There are two main points in the Austrian Chancellor's speech: one is the issue of restoration, and the other is the issue of the National Socialist Party's activities. These two issues are the focus of the recent conflict between Germany and Austria, and also the theme of Neurath's negotiations in Vienna this time. Regarding the issue of restoration, the Austrian Chancellor explained the Patriotic Front's attitude in three points in his speech. First, respect the historical traditions of Austria. Second, only the Austrian people have the right to decide on the form of government they adopt. Third, the issue of the form of government is important and must be handled with caution. Although the Austrian Chancellor does not advocate the immediate implementation of the restoration, his attitude against other countries interfering in Austria's form of government is very clear. In other words, the issue of Austria's restoration is an internal affair that can only be decided by the Austrian people themselves and cannot be interfered with by other countries. However, this attitude is strongly opposed by Germany, because Germany will never allow Austria to be restored. If Austria implements the restoration, then Germany's ambition to annex Austria will have no hope of being realized. Although the Austrian Chancellor advocated that the issue of the form of government should be handled with caution in his speech, he is not a person who opposes the restoration. He only feels that the time is not yet ripe. At the same time, the general restorationists have been actively campaigning everywhere recently, and their momentum is very strong. This is naturally a cause for great anxiety in Germany.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the issue of the National Socialist Party's activities in Austria, although a temporary solution was reached after the conclusion of the July agreement last year, the conflict between the two sides is still very sharp. Recently, when Neurath arrived in Austria, the Austrian National Socialist Party held a grand demonstration, shouting "Heil Hitler," and had a major conflict with the government. This is a recent example. The Austrian Chancellor also stated in his recent speech that the establishment of the "German Social and Cultural Alliance" and other similar pro-German organizations is inappropriate. At the same time, among the more than 1,100 political prisoners in Austria, there are more members of the National Socialist Party than members of the Communist Party (the former being 725 and the latter being 437). These facts can all explain that the conflict between the Austrian government and the Austrian National Socialist Party under the command of Germany has not been eliminated due to the conclusion of the good-neighborly agreement last year.</p>
<p>Although Neurath's visit to Vienna this time is to discuss a proper solution to the above two important issues and other minor issues with the Schuschnigg government, it is a big question whether a satisfactory result can be obtained.</p>
<h3>Japanese Minister of Army States Military Expansion Aimed at Defending Against Russia</h3>
<p>If Russian Far East troops are not withdrawn, relations between the two countries will be difficult to improve.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The relationship between Japan and Russia, which is related to the military budget, is now the central topic of discussion in the Diet. Yesterday, Seiyukai member Funada Tanaka questioned the death issue at the budget general meeting, saying, "Is the purpose of the army to strengthen military preparations based on the premise that war with Russia is inevitable? Also, there are often undeclared wars between the Japanese and Russian armies on the Russian-Manchu border. Under these circumstances, does the government really have hope of peacefully resolving Japanese-Russian relations?"</p>
<p>Army Minister Sugiyama and Foreign Minister Hayashi explained the government's fundamental views on this question as follows: "The army's strengthening of military preparations is not for the purpose of war, but to prevent war. As for Japanese-Russian relations, they have not yet been hopeless. As of today, the Soviet Union has been quite insincere, but if the Soviet Union reflects on this point, withdraws certain Far East military preparations that threaten other countries, and stops the communist party's work of redressing China and Manchuria, then Japanese-Russian amity is not impossible.

<h3>Situation of Questioning at the General Meeting of the House of Representatives Budget</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The General Meeting of the House of Representatives Budget was reopened at 7:33 pm on the 22nd and adjourned at 10 pm. The main questions and answers at the meeting were as follows:</p>
<p>Funada Tanaka (Seiyukai) asked:</p>
<p>The army has repeatedly issued pamphlets, etc., to promote the public's awareness of emergency time. Is there a premise in the pamphlets that war is inevitable, and is it definitely in such a situation now?</p>
<p>Army Minister Sugiyama replied:</p>
<p>The authorities believe that strengthening military preparations is the only way to prevent war, so they expect the strengthening of national defense.</p>
<p>Navy Minister Minei replied:</p>
<p>My opinion is the same as that of the Army Minister. Funada Tanaka asked:</p>
<p>Economic plans are currently being established in Manchuria, Korea, and Taiwan. In my opinion, an economic conference should be held including Japan and these regions. What is the Prime Minister's opinion on this?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied:</p>
<p>There is indeed a need to convene such an economic conference, so we plan to consider this issue in the future.</p>
<p>Funada Tanaka asked:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic development in North China, are there any concrete cooperation methods under consideration?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hayashi also replied:</p>
<p>Regarding economic cooperation, there are plans that have already been implemented, such as the advancement of the textile industry, the electrical business of the Xingzhong Company, the technical guidance for the salt industry and cotton cultivation, and the construction of railway plans.</p>
<p>Funada Tanaka asked:</p>
<p>In order to strengthen national defense and build the country, it is necessary to seek its resources overseas. What is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' policy on this?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hayashi also replied:</p>
<p>Currently, negotiations on the allocation of resources are being conducted by various countries. We look forward to the realization of a fair allocation of resources. Funada Tanaka asked:</p>
<p>It is extremely necessary for Japan, Manchuria, and the colonies to become one entity and establish an economic plan. May I ask for the Prime Minister's opinion?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied:</p>
<p>I agree with Mr. Funada's views. The government is currently proceeding in this direction. (23rd Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rural Revival Strategy [Tokyo] The General Meeting of the House of Representatives Budget on the 23rd opened at 10 am. After Minseito member Murakami Kokichi questioned Prime Minister Hayashi about the establishment of an industrial country, he and Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki repeatedly debated about rural salvation countermeasures and industrial union theory for a long time, taking up a lot of time. Imitating a classroom on rural policy, the result was that the questions from Mr. Murakami led to answers from various ministers. Among them, the following points are noteworthy:</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi:</p>
<p>Currently, there is no intention to establish an investigation agency for industrial unions immediately.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Yuki:</p>
<p>Regarding the harmony between industry and agriculture, it is necessary to study. In order to revitalize the countryside, it is necessary to study what kind of policies are needed for the development of rural industries.</p>
<p>Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki:</p>
<p>The reasons for the current rural poverty are: first, Japan's rural areas are operated by small farmers; second, there is no preparation to cope with the economic changes since the Meiji era. The first countermeasure is to seek to reduce production costs and control sales. The second countermeasure is to study methods such as joint operations. Among the many industrial unions, there are those that cannot satisfy people. It is planned to promote the self-reflection of the unions themselves. A law on the autonomous management of industrial unions is planned to be submitted in the next few days. A debt reorganization plan is also planned to be submitted to this Diet. It is currently under study.</p>
<p>Iron Famine Problem The General Meeting of the House of Representatives Budget reopened at 1:30 pm.</p>
<p>Kato Ryogoro (Seiyukai)</p>
<p>Asked:</p>
<p>From the iron famine to the recent impact of rising steel prices, I believe it is a major social problem. What are the countermeasures?</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo:</p>
<p>The iron famine is a major social problem, and I agree. The countermeasures are to quickly seek to enrich production and adjust supply and demand, and at the same time crack down on the hoarding of sellers.</p>
<p>Kato asked:</p>
<p>Is the enactment of the Japan Steel Law a failure? Is the forecast of steel supply and demand incorrect?</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo replied:</p>
<p>The enactment of the Japan Steel Law is by no means a failure. The estimates of supply and demand may have been somewhat overestimated at the time, but there will definitely be no errors in the future.</p>
<p>Kato asked:</p>
<p>What are the prospects for pig iron imports?</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo replied:</p>
<p>Japan needs about 3 million tons, half of which is supplied domestically and half is generally imported from the United States.</p>
<p>Kato asked:</p>
<p>The calculation of iron supply and demand for the 12th year should be clearly stated.</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo immediately provided a calculation table and explained it. Kato then asked what the future steel production capacity is expected to be.</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo replied:</p>
<p>The future steel production capacity will be 6 million tons in Japan's mainland, and the target for Japan and Manchuria combined is 8 million tons.</p>
<p>Kato asked:</p>
<p>Does the government allow raising the price of iron? Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo replied that it is difficult to explain at present.</p>
<p>Kato also asked:</p>
<p>It is heard that the organization for the sale of iron and steel is jointly established by Japan and Manchuria. What is the expected situation?</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce and Industry Godo replied that it still needs to be reviewed, and the method of unification is currently being studied, etc.</p>
<p>Kato then discussed the problems of small and medium-sized merchants and industries, saying that the government should adopt a epoch-making policy for these merchants and industries that are overwhelmed by large capital.</p>
<p>Then, Kinai Masayasu of the Showa Association questioned Prime Minister Hayashi about the reason for rejecting party members from joining the cabinet. Prime Minister Hayashi said that the situation at the time was such that it could not be helped. Kinai also raised questions about reforming the administrative structure, abolishing the Takumusho (Colonial Affairs Ministry), reforming the judicial system, and trampling on human rights. Prime Minister Hayashi briefly explained them all. Rest at 6:20 pm, and reopen at 7:44 pm. (23rd Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Sato, Ambassador to France, Makes Remarks in Hong Kong En Route Home</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Sato Naotake, Ambassador to France and a strong candidate for Foreign Minister, arrived in Hong Kong harbor aboard the Jingkuni Maru on the 23rd and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>I have not received any contact from the government regarding assuming the position of Foreign Minister. I have been a diplomat for thirty years and am the most senior ambassador. I intend to retire at this time and give way to younger generations. However, I also have opinions on diplomatic policies to cope with the current extraordinary domestic and international situation. If they are adopted, I will consider it. (Daimeng Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British Coronation</h3>
<p>Expenses Require Over 150,000 Pounds. Asis will be Invited to Participate</p>
<p>[London] According to Treasury Financial Secretary Colville's announcement in the Lower House, the coronation ceremony of the British monarch on May 12th at Westminster Abbey will not be broadcast via film, but only via radio. Colville also stated that the number of seats prepared for this coronation is four times greater than that for the 50th anniversary celebration of the ascension of King George V, and the number of attendees in Westminster Abbey will be 700 more than at the coronation in 1911. Colville estimates the national cost of the coronation at 152,000 pounds. Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore reported that the army units participating in the coronation parade will consist of 120 officers of various ranks from the colonies, the Royal West African Frontier Force, the Transjordan Frontier Force, the Malay Army, and other local defense forces. The British government anticipates an unprecedented number of attendees from around the world at the coronation. Heads of state of all countries with diplomatic relations with Britain have received invitations to send representatives to attend, and some independent countries without diplomatic envoys but with treaty relations have also been invited. According to the British Imperial Airways, all seats on flights from India, Africa, Australia, and other places to Britain for the coronation have been sold out long ago, with some reservations made months in advance. Furthermore, from May 12th to 17th, major buildings in London, such as Buckingham Palace, the Victoria Memorial, St. James's Palace, the Houses of Parliament, the Royal Museum, the Tower of London, Somerset House, the dome of Greenwich Hospital, Windsor Castle, Hampton Court, the Admiralty Arch, Westminster Abbey, St. George's Chapel at Windsor, Trafalgar Square, and the Royal Mint, will be illuminated with searchlights.

<h3>Germany Suggests Four-Nation Defense Alliance to Austria</h3>
<p>Austrian Authorities Arrest National Socialist Party Members En Masse. Goering Visits Polish President and Returns Home</p>
<p>[Vienna] German Foreign Minister Neurath held talks with Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Schmidt this morning, continuing into the afternoon. According to responsible sources, Neurath mentioned the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty in Austria during the morning talks, but did not make any demands on behalf of the German government, only stating that the German authorities expressed reservations about the restoration. Furthermore, 360 people were arrested during the demonstration by the Austrian National Socialist Party yesterday, 40 of whom are currently detained by the police, while the rest have been released. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] It is reported that German Foreign Minister Neurath, during his meeting with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg today, presented a plan to revive the old Triple Alliance. The plan stipulates that if Austria agrees not to restore the Habsburg dynasty, Germany is willing to facilitate a four-nation treaty between Germany, Italy, Austria, and Hungary. If Austria or Hungary is attacked, Germany and Italy should provide active assistance. However, if Germany or Italy goes to war with another country, Austria and Hungary only have the obligation to maintain "friendly neutrality." In addition, a special economic agreement will be concluded that is in the special interests of Austria, in order to further consolidate this four-nation treaty. It is said that this plan has been decided upon unilaterally by Germany, because Germany firmly believes that Schuschnigg has decided to restore the Austrian monarchy. If this comes to pass, National Socialism in Austria will never be able to raise its head, because Germany will not be able to use force to prevent the restoration of the Austrian imperial family. It is also reported that Schuschnigg has not abandoned his inclination to restore the imperial family, because Austria has the right to make its own choices if it wants to restore the monarchy at any time, and Schuschnigg believes that a four-nation treaty is not impossible under a monarchy. Furthermore, Schuschnigg is worried about triggering renewed opposition from the Little Entente and the Balkan countries. It is said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also has the same concerns. Furthermore, the demonstrations by Austrian National Socialist Party members when the German Foreign Minister arrived in Vienna yesterday have caused considerable resentment to Schuschnigg, while the German side is also dissatisfied with the arrest of some Austrian National Socialist Party members. (Central News Agency, Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Berlin] It is rumored that German Foreign Minister Neurath suggested to Austrian Chancellor Dr. Schuschnigg today that a four-nation defense agreement be concluded between Germany, Austria, Italy, and Hungary. A German government spokesman now declares that he knows nothing about this plan. (Central News Agency, Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] When German Foreign Minister Neurath arrived here today, about 200 members of the Austrian National Socialist Party were arrested and imprisoned for participating in demonstrations. The authorities have increased the deployment of military and police for prevention. However, as of tonight, apart from some disturbances in the streets, it is still peaceful. It is rumored that Pro-German Security Minister Stumme will resign due to disagreements with Chancellor Schuschnigg. If this happens, the German-Austrian cooperation movement will suffer another blow. (National Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>[Berlin] General Goering, Minister of Aviation, previously visited Poland to hunt with President Mościcki. He has now returned here after completing his business. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw According to Polish newspapers, Goering hunted three lynxes, three wolves, and ten wild boars in Białowieża, and four lynxes, two wolves, and sixteen wild boars in Polesie. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] After German Foreign Minister Neurath arrived here today, he visited Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Schmidt. In the afternoon, Schuschnigg and Schmidt returned the visit and presented Neurath with an Austrian medal. In the afternoon, National Socialist Party members held several demonstrations in the Theater Square, while the Austrian Patriotic Front also gathered thousands of people in the square to hold counter-demonstrations, shouting slogans with excitement. National Socialist Party members attempted to break into the Patriotic Front's demonstration area but were unsuccessful. The police arrested more than 200 National Socialist Party members. The police department found that these party members had come to the capital specifically from other provinces to participate in the demonstrations, indicating that some group was paying for their travel expenses behind the scenes. Observers believe that the National Socialist Party members' demonstration on the main streets today will make Neurath's negotiations more difficult. Neurath wants the Austrian government to make concessions to the domestic National Socialist Party, but after this disturbance, the Austrian authorities will definitely not agree. As for the issue of the restoration of the Habsburg dynasty, although Neurath also wants to discuss it, Schuschnigg believes that this is purely an internal affair and is naturally unwilling to discuss it. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Vienna] After German Foreign Minister Neurath arrived here yesterday, Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg hosted a formal banquet at the Belvadere Palace that evening. Although the situation was extremely splendid, compared with the recent receptions for Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy, it seemed to lack sincerity and enthusiasm, which was due to the demonstration held by the National Socialist Party members yesterday. Therefore, some people believe that this trip by Neurath will be difficult to achieve concrete results in terms of improving German-Austrian relations and even establishing a cultural agreement. Even German sources here believe that the committee originally planned by Germany and Austria to determine the content of the cultural agreement at the end of next month may not be successful in the current situation. In short, Neurath's trip has been dimmed by the demonstration held by the National Socialist Party members. As for the demonstration, it is obvious who instigated it. This matter is indeed, as a certain important person said, "Nothing hinders the value of Neurath's trip more than this." Furthermore, last night, it was widely rumored that the Patriotic Front authorities had summoned a large number of party members to demonstrate, so that when the National Socialist Party continued to demonstrate today, they could respond. The newspapers are very uneasy about this kind of demonstration by the National Socialist Party and say that it will cause repercussions. For example, the semi-official Federal Postal News stated, "Behind this kind of demonstration, there must be someone instigating it, and someone must be secretly providing financial support. We must thoroughly investigate this inside story to clarify the truth." The actions of the Austrian National Socialist Party members are aimed at undermining the German-Austrian agreement concluded on July 11 last year. The New Vienna Daily also holds the same view, stating that "Some of the National Socialist Party members who participated in yesterday's demonstration came from other provinces, which shows that they had planned it long ago."

<h3>Romania Holds Air Defense Drill</h3>
<p>Citywide Lights Extinguished</p>
<p>[Rome] Rome held an air defense drill last night. When the sirens sounded an emergency warning, the lights within fifteen miles were extinguished, including those in hospitals and the Pope's residence, which were plunged into darkness. Doctors in hospitals continued surgeries under flashlight, while diners in hotel restaurants dined by candlelight. All traffic on the streets stopped, and pedestrians rushed indoors to take refuge. Rome was plunged into a state of death for forty-five minutes. (Central News Agency, Reuter, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Spain's Oversight Plan, Britain and Portugal Reach Agreement</h3>
<p>British Personnel to Oversee Portuguese Border. Oversight Expenses 900,000 Pounds</p>
<p>[London] As a result of last night's meeting of the sub-committee of the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee, Britain and Portugal have reached full agreement on the oversight of the Portuguese border. 130 British inspectors will be stationed on the Portuguese border to prevent volunteers and military supplies from flowing into Spain. The French-Spanish border is currently guarded by 170 international inspectors. Whether or not the number of these inspectors should be reduced will continue to be discussed. During yesterday's meeting, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop raised the issue of stopping the foreign currency deposits of the Valencia government, which Soviet Ambassador Maisky opposed for lack of relevance. The meeting then passed measures for naval patrols along the Spanish coast to prevent military supplies from entering Spain by sea. However, the Soviet representative still needs to consult with Moscow regarding the part assigned to be guarded by the Soviet Union. (Central News Agency, Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>[London] The Adjustments Committee for the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Measures held a meeting this afternoon. Chairman Lord Plymouth announced that Britain and Portugal had reached an agreement on Portugal's participation in the oversight of the Spanish land border, stipulating that Britain would send 160 personnel to implement oversight at Portuguese ports and at the border with Spain. This measure has been accepted by Portugal. Afterwards, the sea oversight measures for Spain were discussed. Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky immediately stated that the current plan is to assign the area of the National Army's jurisdiction along the Bay of Biscay in northern Spain to be overseen by the Soviet Navy, but navigation is inconvenient there, and the Soviet Navy may have difficulty implementing the oversight. He will consult with his government for instructions. In addition, the total cost of the oversight plan is said to be about 900,000 pounds, of which Britain will bear 16% and France will bear 12%. The general organization for managing the oversight affairs will be located in London. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Rome] The ban on volunteers going to Spain has been in effect since midnight on the 20th.

In addition, the Minister of Interior will take special measures to prevent volunteers from departing or transiting to Spain. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Government Troops Make Progress on Southern Outskirts of Madrid</h3>
<p>Several Rebel Aircraft Attack Valencia</p>
<p>⊙Valencia Several rebel three-engine aircraft attacked here twice today, dropping twelve bombs. The number of casualties is unknown. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>⊙Madrid According to a message from this agency's reporter, government troops are continuing to advance southeast of the capital along the Jarama River, covered by aircraft and artillery. They have already captured several new positions, without encountering strong resistance from the Nationalist Army. In the northeastern Aragon province, the Nationalist Army used aircraft to assist in the attack on Podarubi, but the government troops opened fire with artillery, calmly sweeping the area, and finally repelled the Nationalist Army. In addition, in the university district in the western suburbs, the Nationalist Army, besieged inside the university, attempted to break out, but were killed by government troops, forcing them to retreat again. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>⊙Madrid The government army on the southern route began its general offensive today and immediately occupied Maranosa. However, after a few hours, they were still repelled by the rebel army. The government army's counterattack was personally directed by the Commander-in-Chief of the Front, Miaja, and members of the General Staff. The attack began at dawn. Although the rebel army's machine guns were very fierce, they failed to stop the government army's advance. All machine gun teams were either disarmed or retreated. The rebel army used tanks in the morning, but the government army also had specially trained teams to deal with tanks, which were immediately transferred to the front line to defend with bombs and hand grenades. Afterwards, the infantry followed closely and drove all the rebels out of the trenches. By noon, three squadrons of aircraft were seen flying to the Jarama River area, and it is likely that fierce battles will also occur in the air. The most intense fighting is now taking place in the Robledo area, 25 miles west of the capital. Government officials also claim that government militias have surrounded a large unit of the rebel army in Avila. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Trade Agreement Negotiations Between Japan and Cuba Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>American Exports to be Affected</p>
<p>⊙Havana It was learned today that trade agreement negotiations between Cuba and Japan are progressing smoothly. The focus of the negotiations is Japan's suggestion to purchase US$500,000 worth of Cuban goods annually and sell US$2 million worth of Japanese goods, of which US$1 million will be textiles, subject to the lowest tariffs. Export merchants estimate that after the agreement is concluded, American textiles, auto parts, etc., will be greatly affected, and Cuban textile factories will be completely shut down, and at least a thousand textile workers will lose their jobs. Cuban representatives are currently studying whether the US$500,000 worth of Cuban goods that Japan intends to purchase will all be sugar, and whether they will be resold after purchase, thus hindering Cuba's existing market.

<h3>Bombing in Abyssinia, Italian Army Conducts Mass Arrests of Locals</h3>
<p>2,000 Arrested, 300 Executed. Total of Over Thirty Wounded in Bombing</p>
<p>[London] The British Consulate in Addis Ababa reported today that over 30 people were injured in the bombing by Abyssinians. The injuries of Italian Governor General Graziani are not serious, with only a wound to his right knee and blood vessels on his hand cut by bomb fragments, resulting in a lot of bleeding. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is now confirmed that after the bombing last Friday, in which the Italian Governor was injured, the Italian military authorities in Abyssinia conducted a mass search of the entire city of Addis Ababa, arresting as many as 2,000 people. Those found with weapons were immediately executed, numbering around 300. Approximately 700 have been released, and 1,000 are still under interrogation. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] According to news from Addis Ababa, after Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia Graziani was attacked by natives in the city, the authorities arrested 2,000 natives and interrogated them by military tribunal. Some of them were executed by firing squad today, and those who were proven innocent were released separately. In addition, General Mariam, commander of the former Abyssinian southern army, recently launched an uprising in the Gala region. He has been suppressed and killed by troops dispatched by the Italian military authorities. The area was not originally under Italian military jurisdiction, so this battle is unrelated to the case of natives attacking General Graziani in Addis Ababa. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>[Paris] American Ambassador to France Bullitt said in a speech at the Washington's Birthday banquet at the American Club today that the United States does not intend to participate in any war and will forever maintain peace unless another country forces the United States into conflict. French Prime Minister Blum also attended the banquet. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>[Paris] The American Club here also held a luncheon to celebrate. Premier Blum was also invited to attend and gave a speech, stating Washington's place in history, saying, "In the past, although the American people gave great power to Washington, Washington was always careful to prevent the power he held from becoming autocratic or permanently controlled by him alone, without the day of returning power to the people of the country. From this, it can be seen how great an influence scholars from France in the 16th and 18th centuries, such as Montaigne, Molière, Voltaire, and Diderot, had on Washington in his thinking." "France and the United States were originally one family, and the principles they uphold are also the same. Since we regard democracy as a just government, we must do our best to promote and develop the sovereignty of democratic countries. As for the aspirations of the French people in the international system, in a nutshell, it is only to maintain peace. However, the current situation in Europe forces France to rectify its military preparations, although it is aware of the heavy burden. As for France's responsibilities to itself and to the countries within the scope of collective security, it has always been courageous, forward-looking, fulfilling, and tirelessly pursuing them, which is obvious to all." The Premier concluded by saying that the International Exposition will be held in Paris this year. Our country dares not be arrogant and intends to make Paris the center of the world at that time. It is hoped that Americans will enthusiastically come to the meeting to share the grand occasion. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Bandit-Suppressed Pseudo-Troop Remnants Retreat Largely Towards Dolon and Zhangbei</h3>
<p>Bandit Pseudo-Strength Lately Hard-Pressed to Show Off Anymore; Military Supplies Stored in Zhangbei Also Transported East</p>
<p>According to Zhangbei communications, the bandit pseudo-army in Chahar Province, under the instigation of a certain faction, suffered a disastrous defeat at Honggeertu. After the National Army recovered Bailingmiao and D庙, although they tried their best to exaggerate the remnants to rekindle the flame, the people's hearts have awakened, and the bandit forces have gradually disintegrated. The conspiracy of a certain faction has become increasingly impoverished, and its westward advance plan seems to have come to a temporary end. In recent days, a large number of bandit pseudo-forces have retreated eastward from Shangdu, Baochang, Kangbao, and other places, withdrawing to the Zhangbei and Dolon areas, approaching the Jehol border. If it is said that they have other plans, given their current strength, it may be difficult for them to succeed in the near future. As for the rumor a few days ago that they were trying to invade Dushikou and Zhangjiakou, it is actually because a certain faction's troop withdrawal plan has been decided, and they are deeply afraid of the National Army's ambush. Therefore, they released this smokescreen to facilitate the retreat.</p>
<p>Li and Zhang, Two Traitors, Take Over Defense of Southern Area</p>
<p>The entire Mongolian Cavalry Division of Bao Yueqing also departed from Zhangbei for Dolon on the 19th. The military equipment in the Shangdu area is also being withdrawn to Zhangbei. The munitions that a certain faction had previously stored in Zhangbei are now being requisitioned from the people, using more than 100 large carts, and are being continuously transported to Dolon. The positions in the Nanhaozhan and Daqinggou areas are now being defended by the pseudo-troops of Li Shouxin and Zhang Haipeng. Traitor Li Shouxin also concurrently assumes the responsibility of military command in northern Chahar Province.</p>
<p>Chahar Provincial Authorities Respond Calmly</p>
<p>With most of the bandit pseudo-forces gathering in Dolon and Zhangbei, Chahar Province seems to feel uneasy. According to a certain gentleman, the Chahar provincial authorities have always adhered to the principle of not losing sovereignty or humiliating the country in their response to the environment in the past. During this period, they will continue to adhere to their consistent principles, seek a normal path, and use it to respond. They dare to tell their compatriots that even if Chahar Province is in a special situation, no facts that lose rights and humiliate the country will be allowed to occur. Moreover, we (as the gentleman calls himself) have the duty to defend the territory and protect the country. If given an order, why resent throwing ourselves into the dust to fulfill our natural duties and win the honor of national heroes. (20th)</p>
<h3>Southern Ping-Zhupi Railway Project Progresses; Branch Line to Be Constructed Between Jiangxi and Guangdong</h3>
<p>The Entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to Be Open to Traffic by the End of June; The Gan River Bridge Has Just Started Erecting Steel Beams</p>
<p>According to Hangzhou communications, the Pingxiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, which is 270 kilometers long, has more than 100 bridges of varying sizes along the route, with a total bridge length of 1,900 meters. Among them, the Gan River Bridge near Zhangshu is considered a major project, with a total length of 594 meters, 13 piers, 4 abutments, 9 spans in the main stream, and 4 spans in the tributary. The track will be laid in the middle of the bridge for trains to run, with sidewalks on both sides. The wharf project is also a large undertaking. The entire Gan River Bridge was originally planned to be completed in two years. Preparations began in September of last year, and construction officially started in October. The Southern Pingxiang Section Engineering Office hired about 1,000 workers to build it themselves, and purchased seven water pumping generators. Taking advantage of the dry season in autumn and winter, the workers were divided into two shifts, working in rotation day and night for 12 hours per shift. The wages were increased by one-third. As of May, 20,000 barrels of cement have been used, and the bridge piers and abutments have been completed. The required steel beams, totaling 2,000 tons for the main stream and 500 tons for the tributary, as well as steel beams for other bridges, have already arrived in Shanghai and are being shipped in batches. They are expected to arrive at the construction site by the end of February. The erection will begin in mid-March, and the entire project will be completed by the end of June. The construction time is estimated to be only nine months, and the speed of progress is truly unexpected. The cost of more than 1.3 million yuan has not exceeded the budget.</p>
<p>Nanchang-Qingjiang to Open to Traffic at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Qiantang River Bridge will be completed soon. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways will then begin to be connected and jointly operated. Previously, there was an intention to expand the Chengzhan Station into a joint transportation station for the two lines. However, because the Yangshi Street area is a prosperous commercial area and demolition is difficult, it has been decided to abandon the plan. Instead, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway will select a site outside Houchaomen to build the Hangzhou General Vehicle Department and the Wangjiangmen to Fengshanmen freight yard, which requires 300 acres of land. It is being submitted to the provincial government to negotiate a price for requisition. The track laying project from Nanchang to Zhangshu on the Southern Pingxiang section has been completed, and material transport vehicles have already been dispatched to transport materials. Ticket sales will begin at the end of this month. The track laying project from Qingjiang to the west bank of the Gan River will also be completed and open to traffic at the same time at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Southern Ping-Zhupi Section Track Laid in Segments</p>
<p>After the Zhupi section was assigned to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for management by order of the ministry, the project was handled concurrently by the Southern Pingxiang section. Earthwork, reconstruction of bridges and other projects have been actively started. The Southern Pingxiang and Zhupi sections of the project are being carried out simultaneously, divided into four general sections and twelve engineering sections. Most of the materials have arrived, but the steel rails and sleepers have been delayed in arriving in Shanghai due to the impact of the American seafarers' strike. In addition to a portion being transported from the Hangzhou-Nanchang section, the Railway Bureau has also dispatched 16 freight cars from Tianjin-Pukou, via Pinghan and Yuehan, to reach the Zhupi section, dispatching special material trains to transport them to the Pingxiang construction site, so as to speed up track laying on both sides at the same time, in order to complete the project as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Zhangshu-Shantou Branch Line Planned</p>
<p>Zhangshu Town is one of the four major towns in Jiangxi Province, the gateway to the Gan and Yuan rivers, with a dense population and prosperous markets. In order to develop transportation and prosper the inland economy, the Railway Bureau previously planned to construct a branch line from Zhangshu to Ganxian, the gateway to southern Jiangxi. The towns along the route, such as Ji'an, have a population of 500,000 and are a wealthy area of Jiangxi Province. The business is expected to be more secure in the future. Personnel were sent to investigate and survey, and there are two lines to follow, one is 210 kilometers long, and the other is 200 kilometers long, requiring more than 10 million yuan in construction costs. Now that the entire line is about to open to traffic, engineer Ge Fuzhao has been specially dispatched to organize a survey team to survey the route from Ganxian through Meixian in Guangdong Province to Shantou, planning to extend it to Shantou to connect with the Chao-Shan Railway, connecting the transportation of Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces. Mr. Ge has taken maps, instruments, etc., and led the team to set off to survey, which is expected to be completed in about two months. He will then draft a report and prepare for the survey. If the Zhangshu-Ganxian line is built, it will connect the trade of Gubu County. Meixian is the concentration point of the Meijiang River basin trade, and Shantou is the gateway to the Gan River, with a trade volume of 15-16 million yuan per year. If this section is completed, the coal from Pingxiang and the specialties from the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line will not only be able to be transported smoothly in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Hankou, but also supply the needs of the coastal areas of Guangdong Province.

<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Bandits Rob and Kill</p>
<p>At about 10 a.m. the day before yesterday, more than a dozen bandits armed with guns suddenly came to Chen Bingtao's house in Xinnan Township, the seventh district, to rob. Chen's grandson-in-law, Deqi, immediately used a self-defense pistol to fight bravely, but because the gun was rusty, the bullets could not be fired quickly, and he was shot in the head by the bandits and died instantly. More than 400 yuan in national currency and clothing and ornaments worth about 100 yuan were robbed. By the time the Xinchang Militia Team and the police station rushed to round up the bandits, they had already gone far away, so they were not captured.</p>

Resolution: The Chamber will reply to the Gaoyou County Chamber of Commerce and ask them to draft the main points and strive with the Ministry of Finance. The Chamber will approve the joint signature. (3) The government promotes income tax, and inland businesses must still bear business tax at the same time. Should we strive to alleviate the difficulties of businesses? Resolution: The Chamber will send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to strive for lighter burdens.</p>
<h3>Wujiang</h3>
<p>Supervising Inspector Caught Prostituting</p>
<p>Fang Bingwen, a supervising inspector of the county's Public Security Bureau, was ordered on the 19th to go to Shengze Town to inspect the police team and secretly investigate the Xin Cheng opium shop for illegal business. That night, he stayed at the Shengze Hotel and summoned a private prostitute named Pin Meili for adultery. Zhang Zhiming, the police chief of the Second Branch of the Public Security Bureau, led all the police officers to inspect the rooms of the Shengze Hotel. In Room No. 8, Inspector Fang and private prostitute Lu Meili were sleeping neck and neck and were caught together and taken to the branch, causing a sensation throughout the town. Xu, the county magistrate of the county, has ordered the Public Security Bureau to thoroughly investigate and severely punish them to maintain police discipline.</p>

Xu, the prosecutor of the court, brought Yang and others in custody for interrogation on the 12th. The defendants accused each other of responsibility for the shooting. Witnesses still need to be summoned and questioned.</p>
<h3>Post-Incident Shaanxi Province - Two Problems</h3>
<p>The Withdrawal of Zhang and Yang's Troops; The Adjustment of County Magistrates</p>
<p>According to Xi'an communications, the reason why the peaceful progress of the Xi'an issue has repeatedly encountered setbacks is that a small number of radical elements under Zhang and Yang's command have unclear understanding and emotional impulses, especially under the pretext of asking Zhang to return to Xi'an quickly, which led to the changes on the 2nd of this month. Fortunately, the responsible authorities handled it properly and quickly settled it. On the one hand, the generals here and the central authorities inevitably have gaps and doubts when they meet directly. Deng Baoshan went south to meet with Chairman Chiang and the central authorities and understood the central government's intention of leniency. The generals of the Northeast Army also understood the central government's difficulties and no longer insisted on Zhang Xueliang's return to Shaanxi before withdrawing their troops. Therefore, they sent He Zhuguo to fly south to meet Chiang and Zhang to ask for instructions on everything. It is now learned that Zhang Xueliang has restored his public rights on the 17th, and He Zhuguo also flew back to Xi'an on the 19th. It is expected that the Northeast Army will follow the central government's orders and withdraw to the designated area of Pingliang.</p>
<p>Gu Zhutong, the director of the Xi'an Office of the President of the Military Affairs Commission, is fully responsible for handling the aftermath of Xi'an in the northwest military, political and party affairs. Gu is cautious, humble, meticulous, and diligent. He sincerely discusses with all parties and has won the sympathy of all parties. The most urgent task at present is the withdrawal of the various armies, followed by the adjustment of the county magistrates. These two issues will not be easy to resolve in less than three months. Along the Wei River basin from Lanzhou to Tongguan, there are approximately □□□ soldiers. According to military experts, the time required for the withdrawal of troops is no less than the time required to assemble the troops. The purpose of assembling the troops is to prepare for war, and the railway and automobile traffic are cut off to supply military transport. When withdrawing troops, all kinds of transportation cannot be cut off to cause great inconvenience to merchants and people. Under the principle of maintaining traffic, efforts can only be made to transport troops as much as possible. In this way, it may take longer than when assembling troops. The issue of county magistrates is also a more complicated event in the aftermath. When Shao Lizi was in charge of Shaanxi, the county magistrates were appointed by Shao and the central government. Some of them were recommended by Zhang and Yang due to the stationing of Zhang and Yang's troops. After the "Double Twelve" incident, the county magistrates appointed by the central government and Shao were replaced by Zhang and Yang. After the Central Army arrived in various places, the county magistrates sent by Zhang and Yang were replaced again. County magistrates are directly related to the people and are of great importance. In the past two months, the changes of county magistrates in various counties of Shaanxi have been complicated. When starting to adjust in the future, all parties must carefully study and research. This issue does not seem to attract deep attention, but in fact, it also requires considerable effort and time. The issue of replenishing the 17th Route Army of Yang Hucheng's troops is also under negotiation recently. (19th)</p>

<h3>Chu Minyi Talks About the Extraordinary Success of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>Chu Minyi, a member of the Central Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. A reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed him about the situation of the Third Plenary Session. According to him, the meeting was excellent: (1) There were an unusually large number of committee members present. All parties united sincerely, discussed openly, and were very harmonious. (2) The meeting also lasted longer, lasting eight days in total. Even Sundays were used for meetings. (3) Before the meeting, the Xi'an Incident had turned from hostility to peace, resolving the crisis without resorting to arms. (4) Various proposals have been announced one after another, allowing the people of the country to see and hear them together. As for the results of the meeting, there were slight changes in party affairs, that is, the chairman system of the Central Executive Committee was restored to the standing committee system, and all members of the Central Committee in Nanjing could attend the meetings. Chen Gongbo was appointed as the Minister of the Ministry of People's Training, and Shao Lizi was appointed as the Minister of the Ministry of Propaganda. There were no changes in the other ministries. In terms of politics, we are all striving for stability and do not advocate many changes. Therefore, the political system remains the same and has not been changed. There are also few changes in personnel, because this is the only way to concentrate forces and cope with the difficult situation. In terms of diplomacy, we still adhere to our consistent policy. Domestically, we have also resolved to eradicate the Red scourge and eliminate its roots. Before the meeting, there was an atmosphere of seeking alliance with someone and tolerance towards someone, but it has now dissipated. The party's doctrines and policies have been clearly announced to the people of the country and the people of the world, as detailed in the General Assembly Declaration. In terms of education, there are measures to provide as much funding as possible for private universities and to harmonize new and old medicine. In terms of culture, a Sun Yat-sen scholarship fund will be established. As for the National Congress, it has been decided to convene it on November 12, and the competent authorities are being urged to complete the preparations as soon as possible so that it can be held as scheduled. I will return to Nanjing on Thursday to attend the Sino-Belgian Gengkuan meeting.</p>
<h3>Bai Mengyu Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Tea Industry Research</h3>
<p>New Tea Plantations Should Be Widely Cultivated in Yunnan Province in the Future</p>
<p>According to the Shenzhou News Agency, the Yunnan Provincial Department of Finance specially sent commissioner Bai Mengyu to Hunan, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other provinces to study the development of the province's industry, with special emphasis on improving tea cultivation. He arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and has been very busy visiting various places. The reporter specially interviewed him yesterday to learn about the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Along the Way</p>
<p>According to him, Yunnan province's Pu-erh tea is very famous and sells well in Tibet. Its strong taste and good quality make it impossible for Indian tea to compete with it. However, the transportation of our country's tea to Tibet is blocked and must pass through India and Myanmar, and then enter. The governments of India and Myanmar are now trying to levy transit taxes on Yunnan tea, so Pu-erh tea will face a great crisis in the future under heavy taxes and Indian imitations. In order to seek emergency remedies, the Department of Finance specially sent me to study new methods of tea cultivation and tea making, because the old methods of tea making in Yunnan's border areas in the past must be eliminated. Since departing last November, I have traveled through Guangzhou, Hengyang, Changsha, Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Hangzhou, and other places for a hundred days, visiting various tea areas or tea markets. After staying in Shanghai for a while, I will go to Beijing and then to Dalian, before going to Taiwan and Japan for research. I will return to the province in about four months to report on my mission.</p>
<p>Improving Yunnan Tea</p>
<p>As for the rich tea production in Yunnan province, taking Simao district as an example, Zhenyue, Fohai, Nanjiao, Linjiang, Cheli, Simao, and other counties all have large outputs that are sold to Tibet, about 15,000 dan per year. About 3,000 dan are sold to the mainland and Sichuan province. Other Jingdong district's tea has a light fragrance, and Shun Ning district is also good. Most of it is transported to Kunming or mixed with Pu-erh and sold overseas. However, border counties such as Nanjiao have vast land and sparse population, and very little is planted, which is a pity. Therefore, the way to improve Yunnan tea in the future is to allow the old tea to develop freely and sell it to Tibet. On the one hand, wasteland will be used to widely plant new tea, while at the same time seeking to improve sales and sales in provinces and internationally. However, in order to improve tea planting, we must first improve rural construction. In the past, rural construction was hardly mentioned, but now it is gradually being paid attention to and is being handled, so that the people can live happily and devote themselves to tea planting.</p>
<p>Rich Border Area</p>
<p>Bai also said that the various counties on the Yunnan border have abundant mineral deposits, but they have not been developed. Whether it is non-ferrous metals or coal mines, they are all available. For example, silver in Lancang, Fohai, and Zhenyue, gold in Jinggu, and mercury in Shuangjiang Jiangcheng can all be developed. At the same time, talents and economic assistance are needed. There are few people in the border area, and only Yi people live there. Outside of the "Gourd King Land" and the mountains of Gongming Kongming Langzhang, Han people cannot enter, and the area, population, and resources have not been clearly understood, which makes foreigners covet them, creating many crises. Now that Yunnan province has been relatively stable in recent years since Chairman Long took office, the provincial government has decided to gradually develop it. The reclamation bureau has now been established in Da Zhuang in Kai County to preside over reclamation matters, with special attention to Yi people's education. Yi people's normal schools have been established in Fohai Shuangjiang, and primary schools have been set up everywhere else to make the Yi people's customs consistent with those of the Han people. The development of the border is easier. Border areas are related to national defense, but the population is sparse, so the immigration of people from the mainland will be very important in the future.</p>
<h3>Foreign Trade in January of This Year</h3>
<p>Import Surplus Sharply Reduced Compared to Last December</p>
<p>According to Shenzhou News Agency, the Jianghai Customs announced the foreign trade statistics of Shanghai Port in January of this year. The total import value was 43,577,266 yuan, a slight decrease compared to the 51,843,764 yuan in December of last year, because this period was during the New Year and the Lunar New Year, so it was significantly affected. Compared with the 35,952,268 yuan in the same period last year, it increased by 7,624,998 yuan. The total export value was 39,435,419 yuan, an increase compared to the 34,664,595 yuan in December of last year and the 37,344,341 yuan in the same period last year. As for the comparison of imports and exports, the total import surplus was 4,141,847 yuan, a sharp decrease of 13,057,322 yuan compared to the import surplus of 17,199,169 yuan in December of last year, almost three times as much. (Units are all in national currency yuan)</p>
<h3>Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires Or Returns to Shanghai from Leave to Take Office</h3>
<p>Or, the Norwegian Chargé d'Affaires to China and Consul-General to Shanghai, returned to China to take office.

<h3>Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company Sends Personnel to France to Organize Procurement Office</h3>
<p>Supervise the Purchase of Materials for Transportation to China; Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to Start Construction in the Near Future</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway, which is invested in by the China Construction Bank and domestic financial circles, has been approved by the Ministry of Railways to establish the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Chartered Limited Company, and after establishing a general office in Shanghai, it has now sent personnel to France to organize a procurement office to supervise the purchase of materials for transportation to China. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is scheduled to hold a groundbreaking ceremony in the near future. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chengdu-Chongqing Railway to Start Construction Soon</p>
<p>The Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company's construction plan has decided to first build the main line from Chengdu to Chongqing, referred to as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. After the main line is completed, the branch line from Neijiang to Zigong and the main line from Chongqing to Guiyang will be gradually promoted. The surveying work of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has been completed. The groundbreaking ceremony was originally scheduled to be held on February 1, but it was postponed due to insufficient preparation. Deng Yiguang, the director of the road engineering bureau, flew from Sichuan to Shanghai last week to meet with Song Ziwen, the director of the China Construction Bank, and then went to Nanjing to meet with Zeng Yangfu, the chairman of the company, to report on the reasons for not being able to hold the groundbreaking ceremony as scheduled and to ask for instructions on everything. He has now finished his work and returned to Sichuan to actively prepare. It is approved to start construction in the shortest possible time. The entire line project is expected to be completed in two and a half years.</p>
<p>Mr. Niu and Mr. Wu Depart One After Another</p>
<p>The construction cost of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is estimated to be about 60 million yuan. In addition to the Sichuan-Guizhou Railway Company's share capital of 20 million yuan, a loan of 34.5 million French francs was also borrowed from the French Banking Group. A contract has been signed, and most of it is for materials, not cash. The material procurement is handled by the manager of the Sino-French Industrial and Commercial Bank, a representative of the French Banking Group. In order to be serious, the company specially sent Niu Xiaoxian and Wu Zhitian to France to organize a procurement office in Paris to supervise the procurement matters. Niu Xiaoxian has already departed from Shanghai on February 3. Wu Zhitian will also leave in a few days due to physical discomfort. After construction starts in the future, the required steel rails and sleepers, except for a part that is produced domestically, will be purchased in France and transported to China for use at any time.</p>

<p>Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>(B) Matters for Discussion: ① It was found that Article 8, Section 2 of the industry regulations stipulates that interest on interbank deposits should be calculated with a 5% discount. Now that income tax is in effect, the burden on depositors has increased. It is proposed to abolish the 5% discount on interest. The standing committee and the executive committee have discussed this several times, and it is believed that this is the trend of the times, and we must reluctantly make sacrifices to consider the overall situation. It was also brought up for discussion at the group worship at the North Guild Hall on February 12, and was passed by a majority vote. Now, a special request is made for ratification. Resolution: Approved for ratification. ② Proposal by the reserve treasury: The real estate deposited in the treasury by various Qian Zhuang, which has not been used for funds, should complete the necessary procedures in advance. Please make a public decision. Resolution: Passed. ③ Proposal by the reserve treasury: Is it feasible to set the value of real estate pledged by various Qian Zhuang to the treasury at 60% of the committee's appraisal, and the value of goods and bonds at 70% of the market price? Please make a public decision. Resolution: Passed. ④ The industry regulations have been revised once since the abolition of the two [currencies] and the change to the Yuan. Since the currency system reform, many of the articles are no longer applicable. It is proposed to revise them again to make them legal and reasonable. Please organize a committee to revise the regulations. Resolution: The committee will consist of eleven members, six of whom will be publicly recommended by the executive committee and five of whom will be publicly recommended by the members' representatives. ⑤ Proposal by the reserve treasury: If there is a net deficit in the accounts between the various Qian Zhuang in the interbank remittance department, how should it be handled? Explanation: The deficit in the accounts between the various Qian Zhuang in the interbank remittance department should be based on the amount of deposits and the remaining amount of collateral in the bank's remittance department. Deposits and debts must be offset against each other. However, the interbank remittance department acts as an agent for various Qian Zhuang to collect and remit funds, which is naturally after the business of each Qian Zhuang is completed, and it is already late. Moreover, the deposit statement of the bank's remittance department and the deposit and debt statement of each account in the interbank remittance department are both prepared after the closing of each account, except for the 10th, 20th, and the end of the month. It is as early as 7:00 AM and as late as 8:00 or 9:00 PM. If there is still a net deficit after offsetting the deposit and the remaining amount of collateral, the time is already late and it is difficult to make up for the deficit, which is not without danger. What method should be used to deal with it? Resolution: Please pay attention to prepare in advance.</p>

<h3>Two Ships Collided Severely off the Coast of Wenzhou</h3>
<p>Collided in Heavy Fog and Damaged; Hulls Adrift</p>
<p>The sea has been shrouded in heavy fog for several days, making navigation very dangerous. Yesterday afternoon, this newspaper received a report that a major tragedy of two ships colliding occurred off the coast of Wenzhou, both suffering damage. After investigation, it was found that there were two foreign merchant ships, one named "Nansbin M:No.23" and the other named "Yosbido M.No.1," presumably carrying goods from Taiwan to Japan. Yesterday morning, when the ships reached the sea area at 124 degrees 57 minutes east longitude and 28 degrees 24 minutes north latitude, which is off the coast of Wenzhou, it was a dense fog, obscuring the navigation route. The two ships were on the same line and could not see each other. When they approached and discovered each other, it was too late to avoid each other, and they collided heavily in the heavy fog. Both ships were severely damaged. It is said that parts of the hulls had ruptured and were taking on water. They have not sunk yet, and the two ships are still drifting on the sea. Whether the crew members and sailors have been rescued is not yet known in Shanghai. The losses of the two ships are extremely heavy. It is still unknown whether they can be salvaged.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Government Protests the Incident at the Shanghai Grand Theater; Italian Consulate to Respond This Morning</h3>
<p>Soviet Consulate Awaits Report on Losses from the Theater; U.S. Consulate Believes It Is Not Involved and Does Not Intend to Intervene</p>
<p>According to a Nanjing telephone call on the 23rd, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested to the Italian Embassy regarding the incident of Italian sailors rioting and assaulting the Shanghai Grand Theater. Nylon, the Italian Vice-Consul stationed in Shanghai, was sent to Nanjing by the Italian Embassy (on the 22nd) and called on Foreign Minister Zhang on the same day to provide an explanation. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is now awaiting a formal written reply from the Italian Embassy. According to the New Voice News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Government formally lodged a serious protest with the Italian Consulate at 5:30 PM the day before yesterday regarding the incident of Italian soldiers destroying the Shanghai Grand Theater. After considering the matter, the Italian Consulate decided to respond this morning. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency made a special inquiry to the Italian, Soviet, and American consulates yesterday afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Italian Consulate's Statement</p>
<p>Last night, according to Italian Consul General Nylon, after receiving a letter from Mayor Wu Tiecheng yesterday (i.e., the day before yesterday), he considered the case and telegraphed to his government for instructions. He has now completed the preparations and will reply to Mayor Wu with a letter tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning). He regretted that he could not disclose the contents of the reply in advance.</p>
<p>Soviet Consulate's Remarks</p>
<p>According to Simonssky, Deputy Consul of the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai, the incident of Italian soldiers destroying the Shanghai Grand Theater is more closely related to China. The Soviet Union is now waiting for the Shanghai Grand Theater to submit a report on the extent of the damage to the theater, the condition of the injured mechanics, and the exact amount of losses. Then, it will consider what steps to take. The two injured persons are currently being treated at the Hongsi Hospital on Daxi Road.</p>
<p>U.S. Consulate's Declaration</p>
<p>American Consul in Shanghai, Stanton, said that this case is a matter between China, the Soviet Union, and Italy and has little to do with the United States. The report that the film "Abyssinia" is managed by the American company Asian Film Company is not known to the consulate. No American businessman has reported this incident to the consulate so far. Whether the U.S. Consulate will also intervene depends on whether the American company Asian Film Company, which operates the film, reports to the consulate.</p>
<p>The China Press reported that the Grand Shanghai Theater was still closed yesterday (the 22nd) for major repairs. The film projector was the most severely damaged, as it was destroyed by clubs. It is said that the damaged parts of the projector can be obtained in Shanghai, so it is hoped that it can be repaired soon. The Italian naval authorities in Shanghai have not yet issued a statement. Italian Consul General Nylon only said that the matter is currently under investigation by the Italian diplomatic and consular authorities in Shanghai. The Consulate General has not received any complaints so far. Two reels of the film "Abyssinia" at the Grand Shanghai Theater were snatched by uniformed Italian sailors that day and were later burned by them at Qichang Road Wharf, far from the theater. Someone who passed by witnessed this. According to reports, the Italian sailors drove to the wharf in a truck used by the Italian naval patrol on land, took out the film, and set it on fire. Several years ago, Italian sailors also snatched an anti-Italian film from the Guanglu Cinema and burned it in the Chinese park on Suzhou Road. According to eyewitnesses of the riot at the Grand Shanghai Theater that day, Italian military police with special armbands were also in the theater at the time, apparently failing to prevent the Italian sailors from committing violence.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Dr. Angiolo, the Italian Commercial Counselor in Shanghai, was rumored to have been on the scene and giving orders when the Italian sailors destroyed the Shanghai Grand Theater. A representative from The Shanghai Times inquired about this yesterday, and Angiolo smiled and denied that he had participated in the incident. He also said that if the Russian staff of the theater pointed him out as the leader, they must have good eyes. He did not know anyone in the theater, so he dared to say that the people in the theater did not know him either. He was not on the scene that day. According to Angiolo, he left Shanghai at the end of the week to visit friends. He only learned about everything when he returned to Shanghai on Monday morning. He had nothing else to report.</p>
<h3>Siamese Foreign Ministry Secretary Chun Visits the City</h3>
<p>Zhou Jue Hosted a Banquet Last Night</p>
<p>Chun, Confidential Secretary of the Siamese Foreign Ministry, visited consulates in Japan and visited our country. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he stayed at the New Asia Hotel. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Mr. Chun, accompanied by Xu Geting, Standing Committee Member of the Siamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and Secretary-General of the Sino-Siamese Association, and Xiao Songqin, the son of Mr. Xiao Focheng, drove to various parts of the city center to tour and visit new constructions such as libraries and museums. In the afternoon, he visited friends and shopped. Yu Ming, a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had already hosted a banquet the night before last. Lin Kanghou, leader of the delegation to Siam, and Zhou Jue, director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, also hosted a banquet at Xinghualou on Fuzhou Road at 7:00 PM last night, inviting Yu Ming, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Bei Songsun, Guo Bingwen, director of the International Trade Bureau, and Zhao Tiezhang, deputy director of the Foreign Office, and more than ten others to accompany them. Mr. Chun will stay in Shanghai for one more day. Tonight, he will board the French postal ship "Félix Roussel" and set sail for Japan at 8:00 AM tomorrow morning, returning to China again at the end of April.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Explains the Meaning of the Deadline for Reporting Capital</h3>
<p>Different from Reporting Assets</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Porcelain Industry Association requesting an extension of the deadline for reporting assets. The Chamber immediately explained and replied in a letter stating that the Chamber received a letter on the 22nd of this month stating that the assets of the industry under the Porcelain Industry Association are meager, with no statistics available. In addition, after the end of each year from January to the end of February of the lunar calendar, they have to rush to prepare for the spring goods in April and May. It is not easy to clear the inventory. They requested the Chamber to forward a letter to the Income Tax Office for appropriate extension of the deadline to facilitate thorough investigation. The current requirement by the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance to report by the end of February of the national calendar is based on the provisions of Article 46 of the Implementing Rules, which refers only to the name, address, capital, or share capital of the store, and does not include assets. The meaning of capital is different from assets. The so-called assets in the letter should be reported together when declaring income within three months after the end of the business year, according to Article 17 of the Draft Guidelines for the Collection of Income Tax on the First Category of Profitable Enterprises. At this time, there is no need to thoroughly investigate the inventory. The necessity of reporting assets. The Porcelain Industry Association mistakenly regards assets as capital, hence the request for extension of the report. Now the Chamber clarifies that this is a misunderstanding, and the request is not necessary.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Police Bureau Begins Randomly Testing Residents Who Have Quit Smoking</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to register smokers in July 1935 (24th year of the Republic), more than 17,600 smokers have quit smoking, accounting for about one-third of the total number of registered smokers in the city. Later, during the period for reporting drug offenses, many cases of relapse and recidivism were found. It is necessary to investigate and verify whether those who voluntarily quit smoking and cancel their licenses have completely quit smoking, in accordance with Article 35 of the Regulations for the Implementation of Tobacco and Drug Prohibition. The bureau has specially drafted measures for the random inspection and re-examination of residents who have quit smoking and submitted them to the municipal government, requesting permission to implement random inspections of residents who have already quit smoking in the city, so that residents who have quit smoking will be vigilant and will not have any thoughts of relapse. The order has been approved, but the number of people who have quit is large, and the number of hospital beds is limited, so it is impossible to accommodate all of them. The bureau will first designate the residents who have quit smoking and live within the jurisdiction of the seven sub-bureaus of Ximen, Shiliupu, Dongjiadu, Wenmiao Road, Yimiao, Xundaou Street, and Laobeimen as the first batch. The number of people to be randomly inspected is 518. The list has been prepared and ordered to the relevant sub-bureaus to follow the instructions, send police to investigate the addresses, and send them to the bureau for transfer to the hospital for investigation. The measures for random inspection and re-examination are recorded below:</p>
<p>Measures for Random Inspection and Re-examination of Residents Who Have Quit Smoking by the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau 1. These measures are formulated in accordance with Article 35 of the Regulations for the Implementation of Tobacco and Drug Prohibition. 2. In order to strictly investigate recidivism and prevent smokers from relapsing after quitting, the bureau may conduct random inspections and investigations of all residents who have quit smoking at any time or on a regular basis. Residents who have quit smoking as mentioned in this article include smokers who have quit smoking in municipal smoking cessation hospitals or designated smoking cessation hospitals, or smokers who have obtained a license and voluntarily quit smoking, and who have applied to the bureau for cancellation of the limited-term smoking cessation license. 3. If a smoker relapses after quitting, the guarantor or family member reports the case to the bureau, the bureau will immediately implement random inspection and transfer for investigation. 4. Three months after a smoker quits smoking, the bureau shall conduct random inspections on a regular basis. The inspection period shall be one month each time, and shall be conducted three times a year. 5. The number of people to be randomly inspected shall be proportional to the number of smokers who have quit smoking in each four-month period. At least two people shall be randomly inspected among every ten smokers who have quit smoking. 6. When the bureau begins to randomly inspect residents who have quit smoking, the responsible department shall designate the number of people according to the registration list of residents who have quit smoking, and submit it to the director for approval before implementing the random inspection and investigation. The smokers to be randomly inspected shall not be notified before the random inspection. 7. The work of random inspection and investigation shall be handled by investigators selected by the bureau in conjunction with the sub-bureaus. The area to be randomly inspected each time and the number of people to be investigated shall be determined in conjunction with the Bureau of Health. 8. After the smokers to be randomly inspected are designated, they shall be summoned to the bureau by name and transferred to the smoking cessation hospital for investigation. Those who are found to have no signs of addiction on their faces and whose neighbors or family members are responsible for filling out a certificate proving that they have not relapsed may be exempted. 9. If a smoker is found to be free of addiction and drugs after investigation, the smoking cessation hospital shall issue a certificate of investigation and release them. If it is found that they have indeed relapsed into opium or other strong drugs, the bureau shall transfer them to the military judicial authorities for strict punishment. 10. If a resident who has quit smoking lives in a special zone, the guarantor shall be responsible for summoning them to the case for investigation in accordance with the law. 11. If the random inspection police are found to have colluded to release prisoners, made false inspections, or engaged in illegal activities or fraud, they shall be dismissed from their posts and severely punished. 12. The bureau shall, each time it conducts random inspections and investigations of residents who have quit smoking, compile a list of the results of the investigation and send it to the Bureau of Health and report it to the municipal government for record. 13. These measures shall be implemented after being approved by the municipal government. 14. These measures may be amended at any time if there are any matters not covered.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Rescues the Da Shun Kang Ship</h3>
<p>Has Dispatched Barges to Unload Cargo</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Da Shun Kang ship, which was carrying rice from Jiujiang to Guangdong, ran aground at Daijiaba on the morning of the 22nd. Because the ship's draft was 18 feet 4 inches, it could not get off the shoal. The bureau telegraphed the Jianghua ship to tow it, but it also failed. Yesterday, it telegraphed the Jiujiang branch, ordering them to quickly dispatch two large barges to the side of the Da Shun Kang ship 17 nautical miles downriver from Prince Isle to open the hatches and unload the cargo to reduce the ship's draft before attempting to tow it again.</p>
<h3>Speech by Swedish Scientist Anderson</h3>
<p>On Excavating Antiquities in Hong Kong</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, Dr. Anderson, the renowned Swedish scientist and discoverer of "Peking Man," has been residing in the South China Overseas Chinese Apartments for some time, engaging in scientific exploration. Having now returned to Shanghai, he recently spoke about the excavation of antiquities near Hong Kong. It is said that this work is progressing gradually, and even if it only achieves ordinary expectations, it will be one of the most exquisite discoveries of Chinese antiquities. According to Dr. Anderson, the work is being conducted on two islands near Hong Kong, one called Lamma and the other Nam Tuo (both transliterations), which contain cultural relics dating back at least 2,500 years. Dr. Anderson firmly believes that the culture of Hong Kong (as he calls it) is either related to the culture of Central China in the same era or even connected to the culture of Vietnam at the time. According to Dr. Anderson, the discovered items are quite abundant, including ornaments, tools, weapons, and pottery. What is particularly interesting is that although many of these items are similar to those excavated in Central China, they also have their own unique style, which indicates that there was a civilization there in the past that is worth studying. When asked by the guest about the ethnicity of Hong Kong's culture and whether he could provide any clues, Dr. Anderson replied that it was not yet convenient to discuss this and that a conclusion could only be drawn after more skeletal materials were excavated. Unfortunately, the sand on the two islands contains very little lime, so human bones buried underground for a long time cannot preserve their original condition. Dr. Anderson went to the two islands at the invitation of Father Finn of Hong Kong, who sought his advice. Father Finn had visited him in Stockholm last year. Unexpectedly, after working on the islands for a long time, Father Finn fell ill and passed away in London a few months ago. After arriving in Hong Kong, Dr. Anderson was received by Mr. Schofield, an archaeologist engaged in the excavation work on the two islands. The two then decided to visit the two islands together. The Governor of Hong Kong specially provided a yacht for them. After the investigation, Dr. Anderson returned to Hong Kong and drafted a plan for future investigations, offering many suggestions. Dr. Anderson firmly believes that when the excavated Hong Kong cultural relics are classified and exhibited in the future, Hong Kong will become one of the most attention-grabbing places for archaeologists in the Far East from the perspective of art and antiquities. On his way back to Shanghai, Dr. Anderson made a short stop in Fuzhou and met with Mr. Frailey of the Fuzhou Christian University, who is currently making a very important contribution to Chinese archaeology. Dr. Anderson greatly admires the scale of Mr. Frailey's current work and is particularly impressed by his discovery of an ancient city site containing strata from the time of Jesus' birth to the present day. Dr. Anderson told the guest that he is very interested in the future of archaeological discoveries in China and greatly admires the great efforts of the Geological Survey of China. Dr. Anderson arrived in China in 1911 and gradually gained a reputation. After discovering Peking Man in 1928, he became world-renowned. He is currently the director of the Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities in Stockholm and has recently returned to China, planning to stay for several months, partly to promote his specialized science and partly to reunite with his Chinese and foreign colleagues.</p>

<h3>Representatives of the Rickshaw Guild Negotiated Yesterday</h3>
<p>Method for Exempting New Rickshaws Agreed Upon; Funding for Literacy Education Pending Discussion</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the Special District Rickshaw Guild petitioned the Municipal Council and the Mutual Aid Association yesterday to reduce the number of rickshaws and the cost of literacy education for rickshaw pullers. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Old Rickshaws Allowed to Be Exempted from Replacement by the Bureau</p>
<p>Regarding the Municipal Council's decision to reduce the number of rickshaws on June 1st and replace old rickshaws with new ones, the Special District Rickshaw Guild sent representatives Yin Zhiling to the Municipal Council Rickshaw Management Office at 10:00 AM yesterday to meet with Director Stadthagen. It was reported that the negotiations were concluded, and rickshaw owners who are willing to hand over their old rickshaws to the Municipal Council will be exempted from replacing them with new ones. For all rickshaws whose licenses have been revoked for violating regulations, the rickshaw owners should bring the revocation receipt and small ticket to the guild for registration, and the guild will forward it to the Municipal Council for verification. Mr. Stadthagen approved this. (Note: When the Municipal Council considers old rickshaws unsuitable for driving, it revokes their licenses and requires them to be replaced with new ones within one month.)</p>
<p>Request the Mutual Aid Association to Allocate Education Funds</p>
<p>The guild also sent Yin Zhiling, Hou Shao'an, Wang Kun, and Gu Songmao to the Mutual Aid Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the funding for literacy education for rickshaw pullers with Chen Tingrui, Chairman of the Mutual Aid Association, and Jin Run'an, Director, requesting that it be paid from the Mutual Aid Fund. Chen and Jin expressed sympathy for the difficult situation of the rickshaw owners and agreed to submit it for discussion at the next board meeting. The rickshaw owners are satisfied. As for the Social Bureau, due to time constraints, they were unable to go and will make a request another day.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Sharing Loss Expenses Completed</p>
<p>Regarding the sharing of loss expenses by rickshaw owners, after the guild stipulated five measures, negotiations have been completed with the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, which has been entrusted to collect the money on behalf of the North Suzhou Road branch. The payment deadline has been changed to before the respective days of March, April, and May, so that licenses can be obtained and business can be operated as scheduled.</p>
<h3>Hongkou District Citizens' Association Calls for Assistance</h3>
<p>Reduce Rent to Lighten the Burden; Negotiate Withdrawal of Japanese Troops from Searched Areas</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, the 25th Branch of the Hongkou District Citizens' Association of this city sent a letter to the Tenants' Association yesterday, requesting assistance in reducing rent to lighten the burden. At the same time, it also submitted a petition to the City Federation of General Associations, which was forwarded to the Party and government authorities, requesting them to quickly negotiate with the Japanese consulate to withdraw Japanese troops and seek the revival of commerce and industry. The original petition is recorded as follows: "In order to request that the Party and government authorities forward the petition to the Japanese consulate, requesting the quick withdrawal of Japanese troops to seek the revival of commerce, we also request that all powerful organizations and groups unite to provide support in order to achieve prosperity. The area within the jurisdiction of our association was the first to bear the brunt of the January 28th Incident. For example, the important passes connecting the Chinese and foreign settlements, the ruined trenches and rubble, still exist and have not been rebuilt. In addition, the frequent warnings last year caused citizens to relocate and not return. Furthermore, the oppression of unscrupulous landlords and the seizure of accumulated debts have caused widespread closures, leading to a decline in the market that is beyond description and a state of commercial misery. However, although our association's jurisdiction is close to the Japanese Marine Corps barracks, there is no major obstacle. However, since the警訊 occurred last year, the Japanese army, under some pretext, has occupied Yongfeng Building, with iron-clad cannons and large groups of Japanese troops patrolling constantly as if facing a formidable enemy, causing people to be restless and affecting commerce significantly. This is the main reason. In view of this, our association has received repeated requests from members to negotiate the withdrawal of the Japanese troops patrolling and evacuate Yongfeng Building to facilitate commerce, etc. Therefore, the association convened a meeting of the entire Executive Committee, and it was resolved to submit a petition to the General Association to be forwarded to the Municipal Government, and to unite with the Municipal Party Department and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association and other organizations and groups to provide united support and negotiate with the Japanese consulate to remove all obstacles and seek the revival of commerce in order to achieve prosperity in the market. We respectfully submit this to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union."</p>
<h3>Liang Shao Liquor Industry Da Cheng Yong Xing Suddenly Searched</h3>
<p>The Guild Held a Meeting Yesterday and Lodged a Serious Protest</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News Agency, the Shanghai Liang Shao Liquor Industry Guild held an emergency meeting of all members at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 23rd), because the Shanghai Inspection Office had sent personnel to the Da Cheng Yong Liquor Store in Nanshi Pier without reason, sealed up the liquor, and seized the account books. Hu You'an was elected as chairman. First, Peng Yaoshu, the representative of Da Cheng Yong, reported that Yang Renzhun and Zeng Zheng, inspectors from the Shanghai Inspection Office, accompanied by armed police, had searched the store for two and a half hours without reason. After the members expressed their opinions, it was unanimously agreed that freedom of business is enshrined in the constitution. The Shanghai Inspection Office personnel took advantage of their position to search the store without reason, seal the liquor, and seize the books, which affected the store's reputation and business. The guild should provide legal assistance. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) Regarding the Da Cheng Yong case: (a) He Xiangshe and others were elected as representatives to request the Customs and Excise Department of the Tax Bureau to expedite the public testing of the liquor taken for sampling and to allow the guild to hire a chemist to participate in the process to ensure fairness; (b) Request the Customs and Excise Department to order the Inspection Office to hand over the informants and send them to court for punishment and to prevent the Inspection Office from doing such things in the future in order to reassure businesses; (c) Send a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for assistance and request that it send representatives to jointly petition and negotiate; (2) Since the problem of Shanghai using alcohol to counterfeit shochu arose, some unemployed members of the liquor industry colluded with unscrupulous inspectors to transport alcohol, and even organized large-scale activities, causing the liquor business to decline sharply, affecting both national taxes and people's livelihood. A thorough solution should be sought. It was resolved to submit a petition to the Ministry of Finance of the Executive Yuan, the Tax Bureau, and the Customs and Excise Department, requesting the implementation of four points: (a) All alcohol produced by Chinese and foreign factories in this city should be taxed according to regulations and the tax rate should be increased to raise the value and prevent the abuse of dilution with water; (b) The inspection matters should be entrusted to a specialized agency for handling and the unscrupulous inspectors should be strictly suppressed; (c) The soil shochu previously detained from various businesses should be publicly re-examined and should not be punished indiscriminately to ensure fairness; (d) The rules for fines should be revised to prevent inspectors from using them as tools. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Monk Throws Himself into the River</h3>
<p>Suicide Note Found</p>
<p>At around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, a monk suddenly threw himself into the river from the Baidu Bridge outside the Suzhou Creek. Li Wenqi, an investigator from the Customs Water Police Station, and Chinese Constable No. 68 spotted him and rescued him. Due to excessive water intake, he had fainted and was unconscious. He was rushed to the Hongkou Tongren Hospital for treatment. It was observed that his condition was quite critical and there was a danger to his life. A suicide note was found on his person, which read: "Sinner Hongliang throws himself into the river and dies, said (mistakenly) to have been forced to death by gambling. Tongchunseng and the monk sit (mistake for rent) a small house. The landlord in Xinkang Lane does not investigate, draws a commission for gambling. The woman is extremely fierce. Shoulai, a monk and an accomplice, is sinister and cunning. I hope you all redress my grievances. Hongliang pays his respects."</p>
<h3>Falsely Claiming to Leave Shanghai to Build a New Love Nest</h3>
<p>Wife Discovers the Truth; He Zhaogan is Sued</p>
<p>He Zhaogan, a native of Suzhou, works at the Zhongxing Trading Company at No. 110 Route Edouard. He married Yuan Pumei (25 years old), a woman from the same hometown, and they lived together at No. 2 Dunji Lane, Nine Mu Di, Nanshi. After seven years of marriage, the couple's relationship was very close. Unexpectedly, He Zhaogan recently became ambitious and became intimate with a woman named Lu Meiling, building a golden house at No. 14, Lane 470, Route Foch, as a place to hide his mistress. On the one hand, he falsely told his wife, Yuan Pumei, that he had been dispatched by the company to a foreign port and had to leave temporarily for a few months. Yuan did not suspect anything. He was able to spend time with Lu Meiling day and night. Unexpectedly, news of this reached Yuan Pumei's ears. She went to the Central Trading Company to find out that her husband had not actually left Shanghai and discovered the truth. She reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which ordered Detective Chen Yaoting to investigate and confirm the facts. He applied to the First Special Court for a subpoena. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce took the bench in the Second Criminal Court for questioning. The defendants He Zhaogan and Lu Meiling did not appear. Their lawyer declared in court that He had returned to Suzhou due to business and could not appear in court today. He requested that the hearing be adjourned to facilitate an out-of-court settlement. Subsequently, Chiang Bao-lien, the lawyer of the police station, filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 239 of the Criminal Law, accusing him of adultery while having a spouse, and stated the facts of the case. He Yuan Pumei then hired a lawyer to appear in court and filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that he be ordered to pay 1,000 yuan in compensation for mental damage. Judge Zhan ruled that the case would be adjourned for seven days for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Drug Manufacturing Operation Cracked on Route Lafayette</h3>
<p>Eight People Arrested, Two of Whom Were Released as Unrelated</p>
<p>Inspector Jiang Futian and Li Xianyang of the French Concession Police Station received a tip-off in the early morning of the day before yesterday, stating that someone had secretly established a drug manufacturing operation for red pills at No. 383-385 Route Lafayette, a three-story earth building of Qian Sen He Coal Shop, secretly manufacturing and selling them to various places in this city and inland for huge profits. They immediately led detectives Zhou Bingcheng, Tao Ronglin, Shen Jinshu, Weng Huanzhang, etc., to the address and searched the operation.</p>
<p>Arrested on the Spot</p>
<p>The managers, Pan Guirong (38 years old, native of Changzhou), Pan Fenggen (30 years old), Pan Fengsheng, also known as Rongsheng (37 years old), Pan Shenshi (32 years old), and Wang Panshi (38 years old), were arrested (all of the above are Pan Guirong's younger brothers, daughter-in-law, and older sister). Twelve pounds of red pills, one pound of heroin, a small amount of morphine, a pill-making splint, a number of pill boards, an oven, twelve red pill bags, a sieve, and other miscellaneous items were seized and taken back to the police station. According to Pan Guirong's confession, the boss of the operation is Ni Fengqi, whose whereabouts are unknown. The shareholder Guan Zhaolin (35 years old, Cantonese) is a waiter at the Yong'an Company Great East Dance Hall, living at No. 9, Third Floor, Xin Ma'an Lane, Dali Road. The red pills were bought from Chen Yiming, a Cantonese at No. 2, De Xing Lane, Mintini Yin Road, Ba Xian Bridge. He made them into red pills, which Chen sold, and Chen's wife, Chen Zhoushi, transported them. The detectives immediately went to the address and arrested Guan Zhaolin, Chen Yiming (35 years old), and Chen Zhoushi (30 years old). After investigation, it was found that Pan Shenshi and Wang Panshi were not related to the case.</p>
<p>Released First</p>
<p>The six suspects, including Pan, were detained and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court yesterday. Judge Liao presided over the interrogation. Gu Shouxi, the lawyer of the Police Department, stated the facts of the case and requested an extension of two weeks for investigation before filing a lawsuit. Detective Tao Ronglin then reported the process of arresting the defendants and searching, and presented the red pills and other items to the court. Pan Guirong confessed during the interrogation that he had been making them for over a month. In the past, he only knew that the boss was Guan Zhaolin, but later he heard that it was Ni Fengqi. His salary was 10 yuan per month, which he received from Guan. The house was rented by his brother Fenggen, and he paid the rent.</p>
<p>He Lived There</p>
<p>Fengsheng made sparrow cards and lived at his place. The two of them had nothing to do with the red pills. He blamed Chen Yiming because he hated him. Pan Fenggen and Pan Fengsheng both confessed that they knew nothing about the red pills. Guan denied being the boss of the red pill operation, stating that he had a salary of 70 yuan per month at the Great East Dance Hall, so why would he do something illegal? He knew Ni Fengqi and used to do vegetable business, but he did not know that he made red pills. He was framed. Chen Yiming and Chen Zhoushi also denied supplying raw materials, selling, and transporting red pills. After the court verified the confessions, it ruled that the hearing would be adjourned to March 10th. The defendants were detained.</p>

<h3>British and Italian Sailors Clash in a Fight Over Dancers</h3>
<p>Fighting broke out in the dance hall first, then continued into the street.</p>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that on Sunday night, soldiers from the British United Regiment stationed in Shanghai and sailors from the Italian gunboat *Lepanto* clashed in a dance hall on Zhu Bao San Road in the French Concession. Two British soldiers were injured, one with a severe head injury and was still in the British military hospital yesterday. Three or four Italian sailors were also injured. The entire case is still under investigation by the relevant authorities. Official information was still unavailable yesterday. However, based on the accounts of eyewitnesses and those involved, the root of the incident stems from an argument between British soldiers and Italian sailors on Saturday night. The incident was stopped by military police at the time, but on Sunday night, the Italian sailors apparently invited a large number of comrades to the dance hall. Around 10:00 PM, a British soldier objected to a military policeman monopolizing a dancer they both liked, leading to an argument. Words turned to blows, and the British and Italian soldiers in the hall came to each other's aid, resulting in a large brawl. Chairs were used as weapons, followed by the throwing of glass bottles. The dancers, seeing the situation worsening, fled. The managers and staff of the dance hall were unable to stop the fighting. Soon, the crowd ran into the street to continue the fight. British and Italian soldiers from another dance hall, hearing the news, also came to participate. According to eyewitnesses, there were about 40 people on each side. It was reported that the Italian sailors were prepared and carried iron bars and lead pipes, similar to those used in the riot at the Shanghai Grand Theatre the day before, resulting in a British soldier being severely injured in the head. The French, British, and Italian military police and the French patrol worked hard to separate the fighters, and the situation was brought under control after about five minutes. The injured British soldiers were sent to the hospital, and three of them were discharged after being bandaged. Information on the condition of the injured Italian soldiers was still unavailable last night. The British military authorities banned British soldiers from going to the area last night. Many British sailors who tried to go were persuaded to return by the British military police. The entire area was quiet as usual last night. The French police have increased patrols in the area. French and Italian military police officers occasionally patrol the dance halls in the vicinity. A reporter from the *North-China Daily News* asked the managers of various dance halls about the incident, but they all replied that nothing had happened.</p>
<h3>Truck Collision Causes Death of Fishmongers; Corpse Examination Conducted</h3>
<p>The three bodies were handed over to their families for burial. The two truck drivers are mutually blaming each other.</p>
<p>Zhang Genfu, a Ningbo native and driver of truck number 16924 from the Fook Kee Transportation Company at 249 界路, and Wu Zhaoyuan, a Nanjing native and driver of truck number 16499 from the Su Hengmao Transportation Company at 127 界路, were returning from the Shanghai Eastern Fish Market loaded with fishmongers at 5:49 AM the day before yesterday. While traveling east to west on Guangxin Road in Yangtzepoo, the two trucks suddenly collided, causing a major accident. Several fishmongers fell from Zhang Genfu's truck, resulting in the following:</p>
<p>Injuries and fatalities:</p>
<p>One fatality: Wu Yongquan, Ningbo native (17 years old). Xu Ayue, Ningbo native (50 years old). Bian Laoan, Jiangyin native (53 years old). Four minor injuries: Kong Qingyuan, Qiu Genfa, Chen Anqing, and Dai Zhongqing, all natives of Ningbo and Shaoxing. Hua police officers on duty at posts 2104 and 2438 arrived after hearing the alert and took the two truck drivers, Zhang and Wu, to the Yangtzepoo Police Station for detention. The three bodies of Wu Yongquan, Xu Ayue, and Bian Laoan were taken to the Forensic Examination Center on Fearon Road</p>
<p>to await examination.</p>
<p>Details of the case have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, truck drivers Zhang Genfu and Wu Zhaoyuan were sent to Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court. Mr. Zhang Yin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, detailed the case and requested that the two defendants be detained for investigation. He stated that, according to the second defendant, Wu Zhaoyuan, driver of truck number 16499, he claimed at the police station that the accident was caused when item 97, a Hua policeman from Anhui named Xiang Shanzhang, who was guarding the prison, signaled him to stop. However, the Hua policeman</p>
<p>completely denied</p>
<p>this while waiting to be questioned in court. Kong Qingyuan, Qiu Genfa, Chen Anqing, and the other four injured individuals, who had recovered, testified that they fell from the truck. Xiang Shanzhang, the Hua policeman, testified that he was coming out of the Ward Road Prison at that time and was passing by the scene when he suddenly heard a machine frame crack on truck number 16924, causing the truck's wooden fence to break. Several fishmongers fell one after another. He did not signal truck number 16499 to stop. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Genfu stated that he was</p>
<p>returning from the fish market</p>
<p>with a total of 23 fishmongers. As they were passing by, Wu Zhaoyuan's truck suddenly drove from behind and passed in front of his truck, then suddenly stopped. His truck swerved to the right to avoid it, and as it turned west, the truck fence broke, causing seven fishmongers to fall from the truck. He said that the accident was caused because Wu Zhaoyuan did not signal when his truck stopped. He requested an investigation. Wu Zhaoyuan stated that his truck only carried eight fishmongers.</p>
<p>As he was passing by the location,</p>
<p>the Hua policeman number 97 signaled him to stop, wanting to go to Tilanqiao. He immediately raised his hand to signal those behind him to stop and hired attorney Fan Gang to defend him. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered them to remain in custody and that the case be investigated further. The corpses of Wu Yongquan and the other two were examined by Court Prosecutor Tang, who determined</p>
<p>that the deceased</p>
<p>Wu Yongquan, Xu Ayue, and Bian Laoan all died from injuries sustained after falling from truck number 16924 while still alive. Wu Yongquan's body was handed over to his uncle, Qiu Genfa, Xu Ayue's body was handed over to her son, Xu Houxiang, and Bian Laoan's body was handed over to Zhang Liangfu, a representative of the Fook Kee Transportation Company, after each made a written pledge to collect the body for burial.</p>

<h3>Gong Chunpu Acquitted of Charges of Conspiring to Harm Important Officials</h3>
<p>Implicated in the attempted assassination of Song Ziwen, he was taken away by the Shanghai Municipal Police Department.</p>
<p>Gong Chunpu, also known as Gong Duanfu, a native of Xiangyin, Hunan, was involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Lord Lytton of the League of Nations Investigation Commission and important officials of our government at the Cathay Hotel in Nanjing in 1932. He was arrested by Hua detectives Pang Ruiqing and Li Shugui of the Old Zhabei Police Station and prosecuted by the First Special Court on charges of attempted murder and endangering public safety. Details of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Chief Judge Qian Hongye continued the trial in Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that during the adjournment, the police had investigated</p>
<p>the Cathay Hotel.</p>
<p>According to the hotel's records, Room 511 was registered to a "Zhou" from February 20 to March 22, 1932. He was a single guest who came from Little Luzon. The police also brought in He Rong'an, an accomplice who had already been sentenced to 20 years in prison, from Suzhou Prison for questioning. Judge Qian ordered Gong Chunpu to step down temporarily and brought He Rong'an to the court. He Rong'an testified that during the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, they were all</p>
<p>fighting on the front lines.</p>
<p>They then retired from service and stayed at Gong Chunpu's house at 62 Jianye Lane for a few days. He heard Gong Lin mention the Cathay Hotel incident, saying that he had booked a room at the Cathay Hotel to threaten Lord Lytton and others with a bomb. He himself did not participate in the actual operation, so he did not know the details. The court asked if he had previously confessed that Wang Yaqiao had instructed Long Lin, Tang Ming, Gong Chunpu, and Gong Xianglin to wear suits and book Room 51 at the Cathay Hotel, but He denied it. The court then ordered He to</p>
<p>identify in detail</p>
<p>if Gong Chunpu was present in court. He looked carefully for a long time and replied that Gong was not in court. Judge Qian then pointed out Gong and said that this was Gong Chunpu, and that he had stayed at his house for several days. He Rong'an replied that the Gong of today did not look like him. When Gong Chunpu was questioned, he denied that He Rong'an had ever stayed at his house. The Shanghai Municipal Police Department then sent officers to the court to request that Gong be transferred because he was involved in</p>
<p>the attempted assassination</p>
<p>of Mr. Song Ziwen at the North Railway Station. The court, finding the facts clear, ordered the commencement of closing arguments. After the police lawyer Ru gave his closing arguments, he had no objection to the Municipal Police Department's request for transfer. Gong's lawyer requested an acquittal and did not object to the transfer, but</p>
<p>requested permission to surrender himself.</p>
<p>Judge Qian reviewed the evidence and ordered the end of closing arguments, declaring Gong Chunpu not guilty and ordering that Gong be handed over to the Shanghai Municipal Police Department to be taken back for investigation.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingbo's Appeal of Medical Practice with Forged Diploma Rejected</h3>
<p>Still required to pay a fine of 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Wang Jingbo, a native of Anhui, is currently 43 years old. He studied medicine in Japan in the past, but returned to China before graduating. Intending to practice medicine, but lacking a graduation license, he devised a method to forge a graduation certificate from the Tokyo Medical College of Japan. He then fraudulently obtained registration certificates from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau and the Health Department of the Public Works Department and began practicing medicine, establishing a clinic at 7 Maoyi Lane, Shanhai Pass Road, for more than ten years without his secret being revealed. In the fall of last year, the health authorities discovered that Wang Jingbo's graduation certificate was indeed forged and sent a letter to the First Special Court to notify the Legal Department of the Public Works Department. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, filed a public prosecution in accordance with the law and ordered the detectives to arrest and bring Wang to justice. After questioning, Wang Jingbo was found guilty of using a forged certificate, which could cause harm to the public, and was fined 200 yuan. During the appeal period, he was released on bail of 200 yuan. Now, Wang, dissatisfied with the first instance judgment, filed an appeal with the Second Branch of the High Court, which has already held a hearing. Because Wang's address was unknown, the summons could not be served, so it was served by public notice. When the deadline arrived, Wang still had no news, so the Public Works Department lawyer, Gan Jingxian, gave his final argument alone. Yesterday afternoon, when the time came for the verdict to be announced, Wang Jingbo's wife suddenly hired a lawyer to appear in court and request a retrial, but it was rejected in court. Judge Yu announced the judgment: Wang Jingbo's appeal was rejected, and he must still pay a fine of 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Labor Dispute at Fruit Shops on North Suzhou Road Resolved</h3>
<p>Detectives make every effort to suppress disturbances; ringleaders sentenced to detention.</p>
<p>There are more than a dozen fruit shops along North Suzhou Road and Wusong Road. Imported fruits are unloaded from ships at the Wusong Road pier on the Suzhou Creek. The coolies who carry the fruits from the ships number about 60 to 70, and they are traditionally from Ningbo and are members of the Fourth District Coolie Union. However, last year, new coolies from Guangdong replaced the old coolies, causing them all to lose their jobs. There was once a fight over work, resulting in a bloody tragedy. After repeated negotiations by Chu Qiaqing and Feng Bingnan, an agreement was reached in principle, but it had not yet been formally concluded. Unexpectedly, the old Ningbo coolies suddenly went to the Wusong Road pier to work the morning before yesterday, causing a backlash from the new coolies. The two sides refused to give way, and a second tragedy was nearly caused. The Hongkou Police Station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to suppress the situation, advising the Guangdong coolies to gather north of the North Suzhou Road tram railway, and ordering the Ningbo coolies to gather on the fruit ships. The police also requested the Shanghai Customs River Police to send more detectives to protect the waterfront. However, the hostility between the two sides was intense. Until yesterday morning, they were still confronting each other from a distance of ten feet, and the carrying of goods was completely suspended. The police detectives were still separating the two sides south of the pier entrance and the tramway, refusing to allow all pedestrians and vehicles to pass, and the situation was quite serious. At the same time, the families of the Ningbo coolies also arrived at the pier, shouting and causing further chaos. The coolies also took out carrying poles and other objects, threatening to use force. Fortunately, the river police worked hard to prevent it, and a tragedy was avoided. However, in order to quickly resolve the situation and prevent further incidents, the police first explained the situation to the Ningbo coolies and persuaded them to hand over all their carrying poles, which were temporarily kept by the detectives. Then, the detectives persuaded the coolies to disperse and returned the carrying poles. At the same time, the police protected the Guangdong coolies and allowed them to continue carrying goods. By about 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the unrest had subsided, and the detectives had all withdrawn. However, Luo Akang, 28, and Jin Heshang, 32, two Ningbo coolies who were suspected of inciting the crowd to cause trouble during the brawl the day before yesterday, were arrested. After questioning and verification by the court yesterday, they were each sentenced to 15 days of detention as a warning.</p>

<h3>Japanese Youth Impersonates a Policeman to Rob People</h3>
<p>According to the *Japanese Daily News*, Japanese residences have recently been frequently targeted by people demanding money, causing widespread panic among families. At 4:30 PM on the 22nd, a Japanese youth, about 32 or 33 years old, suddenly entered the residence of Okamoto Hisao, an employee of the Japanese Telegraph Office at 69 Haskell Road, claiming to be an officer of the Public Works Department Police Station. He threatened them not to make a sound, saying, "If you make a sound, I'll shoot you." He drove Okamoto's wife and children to the bed wall downstairs and robbed them of gold-rimmed glasses, a ring, a radio, and other items worth more than 200 yuan, and fled. The Hongkou Public Works Department Police Station and the Japanese Consulate General Police rushed to the scene after hearing the alert. The suspect had already escaped without a trace. Later, after investigation, it was learned that the thief was similar to the one who extorted cash from a Japanese person on Dixwell Road on the 21st. The Consulate General Police Station is currently conducting a strict search.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Abducted in Downtown Area</h3>
<p>Four Men Forcibly Drag Her into a Car – Police Bureau is Thoroughly Investigating</p>
<p>At about 5:30 PM the day before yesterday, on Political East Road in the downtown area, four men suddenly drove up in a car with the Shanghai International Settlement license plate number 4340. One man jumped out and forcibly dragged a young woman (who appeared to be a female worker walking alone) into the car. Although the woman struggled to resist, she was too weak and was eventually taken away. By the time the precinct police arrived after receiving the report, the car had disappeared. It was later learned that only one suspect had been arrested, but he denied any involvement in the incident while in the downtown precinct. Therefore, the truth is not yet clear.

<h3>Unification and Peace (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Recently, some others have said that unification can only be achieved through resistance against the enemy. This is one version of "seeking unification through resistance against the enemy." Conversely, they believe that if there is no unification, someone will definitely not resist the enemy. The question is: Who is not resisting the enemy? In their minds, they think that the Central Government is not resisting the enemy, so the Xi'an Incident was actually carried out by such confused people. They think that the Central Government does not resist the enemy and only the communist bandit generals resist the enemy. Therefore, when the Central Army fought in Suiyuan, they insisted that the Central Army was supervising Fu Zuoyi in Suiyuan. During the January 28th Incident, the Fifth Army went to the Jiangwan Miaohang area to resist the enemy and made heroic sacrifices, but they insisted that the Fifth Army was there to disarm the 19th Route Army. Most of the expenses for the defense works on the Suiyuan front were subsidized by the Central Government, allowing them to be completed quickly, but they insisted that the Central Government was unwilling to resist the enemy. Their motives are truly unspeakable! On the other hand, if Zhang Xueliang's troops were resisting the enemy, why didn't they sacrifice themselves for righteousness during the September 18th Incident? Why didn't they put forth effort during the fighting at the Great Wall and Shanhaiguan? They even kidnapped the commander who was directing the resistance against the enemy in Xi'an when the war of resistance was raging at the Suiyuan front, which affected the soldiers on the front lines. Is this true resistance against the enemy? Is this "seeking unification through resistance against the enemy"?? I believe that we should unite with friendly countries and resist the enemy. But to resist the enemy, we must have a nationwide resistance against the enemy, and resistance under unified command can be effective. This is "respecting the king and expelling the barbarians," which is also "securing the interior and repelling foreign aggression." Even the Communist Party can only acknowledge this truth now.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, I bought a Communist Party's "Masses' Newspaper" today, which has a passage explaining that unification must come before resistance against the enemy. The title of this article is "A True National Salvation Movement for Unification." It is as if the national salvation movement for unification, which has been enthusiastically promoted in various places recently, is fake, and only what is said in this article is true. Their original text is:</p>
<p>"First, does China need unification? Our answer is: Without a doubt, China absolutely needs unification. If we cannot achieve unification in politics and military affairs, we can never fight against foreign aggression or stabilize the people's livelihood internally.</p>
<p>"Second, how should we achieve true unification? Our answer is: We must achieve unification through union; we must consolidate unification by resisting the enemy."</p>
<p>"Third, what should we do after unification? Our answer is: We seek victory in resisting the enemy through unification."</p>
<p>In the first paragraph, they admit that unification is needed, and that resistance against the enemy can only be achieved after political and military unification. Otherwise, they cannot resist foreign aggression or stabilize the people's livelihood internally. The second paragraph contradicts the first, saying that we must consolidate unification by resisting the enemy, which is the argument of "seeking unification through resistance against the enemy." According to this statement, it is tantamount to arguing that unification cannot be achieved without resisting the enemy. Isn't this contradictory to the first paragraph? But the third paragraph contradicts the second again, saying that we seek victory in resisting the enemy through unification. In other words, without unification, victory in resisting the enemy is not guaranteed. According to these three paragraphs, which comes first, unification or resistance against the enemy? It's truly perplexing. It's like asking whether the chicken came before the egg, or the egg hatched before the chicken, which becomes a comical question. Why are they saying such contradictory things? Because the need for unification in China today is undeniable, but they are unwilling to definitively admit that unification is the most important thing, insisting on talking about union and resistance against the enemy, so they cannot justify themselves and are hitting walls everywhere. Therefore, according to the Communist Party's newspaper, it can also be proved that resistance against the enemy can only be achieved after unification, and victory can only be achieved through resistance against the enemy.</p>
<p>Our argument is not like the Communist Party's, which is erratic and elusive. We are not like them, who used to advocate class struggle and now talk about national liberation, not hesitating to challenge today's self with yesterday's self. We have always acknowledged that only unification can truly resist the enemy, and only with unification can there be a true war with foreign countries. Can the war of resistance in Suiyuan be considered an international war? Can the January 28th Incident be considered an international war? Can the Battle of the Great Wall be considered an international war? None of these can be considered true modern wars, only passive resistance. A modern war between countries is a war of the entire nation, a comparison of the nation's total mobilization power. During the Battle of Shanghai, which lasted for more than a month, the enemy landed from Liuhe to encircle the rear, and only fought in the Zhabei Jiangwan area, without touching the Nanshi concession at all. Can this be regarded as a true war? Taking the Battle of the Great Wall and the Battle of Rehe as examples, the enemy did not send a large number of troops to occupy Peiping and Tianjin first, cutting off the rear railways, so it cannot be regarded as a formal international war. If a real war breaks out, the enemy would have attacked from all directions, and the Yellow River Basin, the Yangtze River Basin, and the Pearl River Basin would all be threatened by airplanes, artillery, bombs, and poison gas. If we are not unified internally, can we truly wage a large-scale war of resistance against the enemy? To resist the enemy, we must at least have unified military command, consistent administrative institutions, and centralized financial and military resources, but if we are not unified, can these things be achieved? Therefore, we should always firmly believe that to resist foreign aggression, we must first do our best to achieve true unification throughout the country. Otherwise, the two words "resist the enemy" are just slogans. How can we hope to achieve unification through resistance against the enemy? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Interport Football Team Captain Yaxu Discusses the Reasons for Shanghai's Victory and Hong Kong's Defeat</h3>
<p>The Shanghai team succeeded by adopting the W formation strategy. Jem's insightful comments: "Hong Kong showed us how to play football; we taught Hong Kong how to score."</p>
<p>The Shanghai Westerners' Football Club's interport football team unexpectedly defeated the Hong Kong team and returned in triumph. Manager and captain Yaxu, after arriving in Shanghai, discussed in detail the reasons for the victory and the reasons for Hong Kong's defeat. His views on football strategy and technique are of great reference value. A translation follows:</p>
<p>The team spirit during this southern tour was excellent. We paid close attention to the game's strategy, hoping for victory. We finally decided to adopt the W formation. Although not all players in Hong Kong are familiar with this method, it is used very successfully by professional teams in England. Therefore, the Shanghai team was able to take advantage of this method.</p>
<p>The weather was not good. Sterger's boat arrived late, only reaching Hong Kong on the evening of the 5th. It was originally scheduled to arrive in the afternoon. The Hong Kong Football Club welcomed them at the wharf. The next morning, the whole team practiced at the naval stadium for two hours. The weather was exceptionally good that day, and the players were all in high spirits. The competition had to be held the next day, so everyone went to bed early that night.</p>
<p>After an early lunch on Thursday, the whole team took a car to the naval stadium. The audience was full. As far as the game was concerned, it was not a first-class competition, but in terms of the audience's cheers, there was constant excitement.</p>
<p>Regarding the criticism of the Hong Kong team, the biggest mistake of center-back Jinbilu (Campbell) was not directly sending the ball to the two wings - if this method had been used at the time, the result might have been greatly changed. From beginning to end, Jin passed the ball to the left and right midfielders, and then sent it forward. Another mistake was that Jin still passed the ball to Li Huitang, even though Li was under close surveillance by Shanghai.</p>
<p>Feng Jingxiang, the Hong Kong team's right inside forward, played with a very clear mind, but his mistake was also constantly passing the ball to Li Huitang, who was under serious surveillance. If Feng had attacked on his own at that time, it might have been effective.</p>
<p>Before the game, Shanghai's center forward, Laubastov, was ordered to move between the Hong Kong side's defenders. Of course, this greatly restricted the effectiveness of Donuton, who had to monitor Lao. The Hong Kong team's goalkeeper was Bao Jiaping, the goalkeeper of the Chinese Olympic football team. The goals he conceded were all unsavable. Fuen's two goals were especially wonderful. In one goal in the second half, Jem Waite made a wonderful pass, and Fuen got the ball and rushed in like lightning. Bao was helpless.</p>
<p>Each member of the Shanghai team did their best and followed the instructions given before the game. From beginning to end, they did not allow the Hong Kong side to rest for a moment. Laubastov was in the center, and Bulingi played as the right inside forward. This position was unfamiliar to Bulingi, but Bulingi followed instructions. His center-forward style of play was satisfactory. Although it was not very pleasing to the eye on the surface, it played a major part in the victory.</p>
<p>The opinion in Hong Kong almost unanimously praised the Shanghai team's better performance. Hong Kong had the advantage in most situations, but Shanghai was able to take advantage of every shooting opportunity and did not let go at all. At the interport banquet, Jem stood up to give a speech, joking, "Hong Kong showed us how to play football; we taught Hong Kong how to score." This can be considered an accurate assessment.</p>

The opening ceremony was held in the morning. More than 20 members attended, including Grabau, Teilhard de Chardin, Weidenreich, Yuan Fuli, Liao Shigong, Huang Jiqing, Zhang Xiti, and Feng Jinglan. In addition to reports on the society's affairs by various staff members, Chairman Yang Zhongjian delivered a speech on "New Strata of Chinese Vertebrate Fossils." Only six papers were read in the afternoon. Zhang Xiti, chairman of the Department of Earth Sciences at Tsinghua University, and others hosted a reception for the members at the Da Mei Western Restaurant at 6:00 PM. Weng Wenhao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and the Department of Geology at National Central University sent congratulatory telegrams to Beiping. A paper session continued on the morning of the 21st, and in the afternoon, attendees visited the Geological Survey's Exhibition Hall and the Cenozoic Research Laboratory. Details of the day are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>After the meeting was called to order, Chairman Yang Zhongjian of the Society delivered an opening speech, stating that the Society has a history of 15 years, but two annual meetings were not held due to various reasons, so this is the 13th annual meeting. A full year has passed since last year's annual meeting in Nanjing. The work of this year has been generally satisfactory, which can be seen in two aspects: First, publications: ㊀ One volume of the English Society Journal and one special issue commemorating Ding Wenjiang; ㊁ Geological Review: one volume of six issues, one issue every two months, and the second volume will continue to be published. We hope that all members will contribute more manuscripts. Second, membership: Last year's annual meeting received only 28 papers, but this year there are as many as 61, which is more than double the number from last year. Many members were unable to attend today, but there are also some who have come from afar.</p>
<p>Fund Management</p>
<p>Mr. Yang continued, stating that in this election of directors, Li Siguang and Grabau were re-elected. The officers of this year's board of directors have been elected and the list of officers was read. He also stated that in order to commemorate Mr. Ding Wenjiang, the Society has established a Ding Wenjiang Memorial Fund Management Committee of seven members, who have been elected as Xie Jiarong, Weng Wenhao, Zhang Hongzhao, Li Siguang, Yin Zandong, Yang Zhongjian, and Huang Jiqing, with Li Siguang elected as chairman and Yin Zandong as secretary. In addition, the members of the Grabau Medal Fund Committee were originally Grabau, Wang Chongyou, Weng Wenhao, Li Siguang, Zhang Hongzhao, Yang Zhongjian, and Ding Wenjiang. After Mr. Ding's passing, Mr. Xie Jiarong has been recommended to fill the vacancy, and so on.</p>
<p>Report on Society Affairs</p>
<p>㊀ Secretary Huang Jiqing reported. ㊁ The income and expenditure of the Zhao Yageng Memorial Research Fund: income of 59,554, and expenditures offset. ㊀ This year, the number of corresponding members increased by five in the United States and one in Germany, with 29 new members, 78 associates, and 9 permanent members. ㊁ Treasurer Feng Jinglan reported on the income and expenditure situation. ㊂ Yin Zandong reported on the editing and publishing of the English Society Journal on behalf of Weng Wenhao. ㊃ Yang Zhongjian reported on the editing and publishing of the Geological Review. ㊄ Jin Yaohua reported on the work of the Beiping branch.

<p>Geological Excursion</p>
<p>Yang Zhongjian reported that the Society plans to conduct a geological excursion after the meeting. ㊀ To Zhoukoudian, the travel fee is three yuan. ㊁ To Badachu in Xishan, the travel fee is two yuan. Both must be arranged with Secretary Huang Jiqing before the 21st. ㊂ If members in the south wish to stop at Yuan Nan for a geological excursion, they should decide as soon as possible so that the Society can negotiate. One more thing to report to everyone today is that we received a telegram from Nanjing last night that member Zheng Houhuai passed away the day before yesterday. Mr. Zheng originally intended to come to Beiping but unexpectedly passed away. Today, we propose to express our condolences for the deceased and newly deceased members. All remain silent for three minutes.</p>
<p>Yang Zhongjian's Speech</p>
<p>Finally, Chairman Yang Zhongjian spoke on "New Strata of Chinese Vertebrate Fossils." Mr. Yang first spoke in English, then translated it into Chinese in sections, and planned to show slides, but was unable to do so due to lack of electricity at noon. The gist of Mr. Yang's speech was that the study of Chinese fossils can be divided into two periods: ㊀ Before 1927, it was only in its initial stage. ㊁ From 1927 to 1931, research was slightly more active. ㊂ From 1931 to the present, although the period is very short, many discoveries have been made. The newly discovered strata of vertebrate fossils can be divided into nine layers: ㊀ Triassic South African Fauna in Xinjiang, Shanxi, and other places. ㊁ Lower Cretaceous Dinosaur Fossils in Shandong, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Ningxia, and other places. ㊂ Early Tertiary in Zhechuan, Changxindian, Yangxi, Hubei, and other places. ㊃ Discovery of new Upper Miocene strata in the Shanwang Formation in Shandong, Cixian County in southern Hebei, and the Jianheshui Formation in Yongdeng, Gansu, and other places. ㊄ Miocene-Pliocene Cyprinid Fossil Groups in the Shanwang Formation in Shandong, Zhoukoudian, and the Upper Pliocene in Shanxi, and other places. ㊅ New research on the Yushe Basin. ㊆ The base of the Pleistocene at Locality 9 in Zhoukoudian. ㊇ New strata of Peking Man accumulation at Locality 3 and Upper Cave in Zhoukoudian, Harbin in the three northeastern provinces, Guangxi cave, and other places. ㊈ The primitive mammal fauna in Anyang Yin Ruins.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Delivery of Yarn Is Active, and Short Positions in Cotton Yarn Are Gaining Momentum</p>
<p>Dealers Are Strongly Bearish 　Market Price Drops Another 2.9 Yuan 　A Reversal Will Depend on Future Actual Sales</p>
<p>The yarn market is weakening, and the decline is particularly fierce. More than 31,000 bales of February futures delivery warrants have been issued, which is a record high in the history of the exchange. This is due to the extremely bearish sentiment among dealers. Another theory is that factories do not currently have much yarn in stock, and if actual sales continue to flow in, there will be a recovery. However, because cotton prices are not expensive, factories are making significant profits on each piece, and factories everywhere are adding spindles and rushing to produce, so production will definitely increase.</p>
<p>Distant Months Fall Below 40 Yuan</p>
<p>The opening price of the morning session for the current month was able to barely hold, rising slightly by one jiao. As the auction progressed towards the next month, it weakened. The second round of bidding opened, and the prices for all months fell uniformly, with the decline being very sharp. Sellers were in a strong position, presumably due to the large amount of spot yarn sold short the previous day. With such a large number of warrants, the shorts became bolder, and as the table loosened, the market price could not be sustained. Except for the March contract, the April and May contracts all broke through the 40 yuan mark. The results of the yarn auction showed that the prices for all months fell by 2.69 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening saw a large number of liquidations of the current month, and the market was particularly weak, falling sharply by 1.2 yuan. However, those who had profited in recent days covered their positions. After the second round of bidding, the market was still normal. It is said that the longs had a very large position in the distant months. At the same time, spot yarn transactions stalled. The results of the yarn auction showed that the prices for all months rose by four jiao compared to the morning closing price, while the current month fell by another three jiao. Geng Fengyu sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. It was found that they sold 2,750 bales of Fukang, 1,000 bales of Hengde, 1,900 bales of Daji, 1,150 bales of Minghua, 6,400 bales of Senkang, 1,550 bales of Fengtai, 950 bales of Juxing, 1,100 bales of Runkang, 1,050 bales of Tonghe, 1,200 bales of Xingchang, 2,050 bales of Xiecheng, and 1,000 bales of Jinkang. They bought 1,450 bales of Dachang, 1,150 bales of Taixing, 2,300 bales of Dafeng, 1,200 bales of Yiji, 1,850 bales of Jinchang, 1,550 bales of Mingde, 1,050 bales of Daqing, 2,200 bales of Taichang, 1,100 bales of Yichang, 1,650 bales of Ruida, 1,600 bales of Changfeng, and 800 bales of Renfeng. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Also Falls by 2-3 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales have become sluggish. The total number of spot yarn purchased by various gangs throughout the day was 637 bales, with prices falling by 2-3 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Continues to Decline 　Distant Months Break Below 4 Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton market continues to decline, and the situation is very weak. Because the yarn market is not performing well, the demand from cotton factories is weak, and sentiment is bearish. In addition, there is a sufficient supply of cotton everywhere, and a large amount is still being shipped out. Coupled with the sluggish situation in overseas cotton industries, the distant months have broken below the 4 yuan mark.</p>
<p>Long Positions in Cotton Auction Are Cut</p>
<p>The opening price of the morning session for the cotton auction was still holding steady. However, when the second round of bidding opened, due to the collapse of the yarn market, selling intensified, and short selling was extremely active. The market price continued to fall. The distant months broke below the 4 yuan mark. The results of the cotton auction showed that the prices for all months fell by 0.45 to 0.55 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening saw the market remain poor, with long positions being liquidated. However, those who had profited later in the day covered their positions, and the prices for all months recovered by 0.15 yuan. It was found that Dafu sold 6,600 dan, Tongfu 1,200 dan, Hengyi 6,000 dan, Yuda 6,800 dan, Minghua 1,800 dan, Yichang 3,300 dan, Runkang 3,800 dan, Xiecheng 7,900 dan, Fukang 1,200 dan, Yongda 2,200 dan, Changyu 2,000 dan, and Xingchang 1,900 dan. Taixing bought 4,300 dan, Jifeng 1,400 dan, Tongji 7,400 dan, Jinchang 5,300 dan, Dachangcheng 3,100 dan, Taichang 4,400 dan, Xincheng 2,500 dan, Changhe 5,600 dan, Gengfeng 1,900 dan, Tonghe 1,400 dan, and Fuyuan 2,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sales Are Slow</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is sluggish, factory demand is weak, and the source is also unseen.</p>
<p>Last Week's Rangoon Cotton Exports</p>

<p>Japan Suspends Indian Cotton</p>
<p>Due to disappointing export transactions and a surge in arrivals, stockpiles have reached a peak as Japanese demand has stalled. With a lack of buyers, the market has become increasingly weak. Futures traders have been consistently selling off. On the spot market, aside from slight inquiries from Lancashire and local factories, transactions have been insignificant due to Japan's suspension of purchases. Statistics for the past week are appended below (in units of 1,000 bales).</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>The Last Day of February Futures Sees a Unified Decline in Government Bonds</p>
<p>Fuxing Actually Rises to the Limit Due to a Short Squeeze</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Securities Exchange experienced significant changes on the last day of February futures. The trend was consistently towards a short squeeze. Although there was no significant change in news, the number of weak long positions was still very high, and rumors circulated in the market that spot deliveries were taking place. Therefore, the closing price was intentionally suppressed by the shorts. There were still outflows of spot goods in the current month, and the market atmosphere became increasingly weak. Type A bonds consistently failed to rise. Today, only the March futures contract was traded for one month, and the market situation is temporarily not easy to improve. Yesterday's activity started chaotically, with prices rising and falling inconsistently. However, the range between the highest and lowest prices was only 0.09 to 0.3 yuan. The second round of trading was relatively strong, with most prices rising by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan. However, Type A bonds still showed no signs of improvement, and Fuxing government bonds actually rose by 4 yuan to 87 yuan with 5,000 transactions, reaching the limit. This abnormal situation was unprecedented. The afternoon opening saw prices remain flat, but due to swap transactions, prices were quite uneven. Type A bonds fell again by 0.1 yuan. At the closing, there were large sell-offs of numbers 5, 10, and 14, and the initial auction prices went from high to low, becoming increasingly weak. Type B bonds in the current month suddenly fell by as much as 0.6 yuan, and Type A bonds fell again by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan, showing a rather weak trend. The resulting prices were high and low, with Type E bonds rising by about 0.2 yuan, Type C bonds rising by almost 0.6 yuan in the nearby month and falling by 0.15 yuan in the distant month, and the rest falling by about 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The total transaction volume was 12,125,000 yuan. The comparison of the resulting increases and decreases is listed in the left table (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<p>New York Stock Market Settles Calmly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market initially saw stability due to the steady overseas silver market and a slight decrease in exchange rates. London gold prices remained unchanged, New York markets were closed, and the Central Bank's exchange rate announcement showed stability for both British and American currencies. The customs gold unit remained unchanged, and the standard gold price remained at 1155.7 yuan. The morning opened flat, and after the opening, some selling pressure caused a slight drop. However, major players bought when prices were low, easily pushing them up again, resulting in a fluctuating market. The market was unusually sluggish. The following is a summary of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1155.3 yuan, the same as the previous close. Xianghe, Hengchang, Yongda, and Changxiang's sales strips dropped to 5.1 yuan. Shengyuan, Yongda, Decheng, Qingfa, and Yongna strips, and HSBC's exchange rate for British and American currencies remained stable, as did the silver balancing tax, gradually rising to 5.5 yuan. Qiafeng, Shuiyuan, and Mao Yong sold off, then retreated to 5.3 yuan. Dadecheng still had limited purchases. The noon close was 1155.4 yuan.</p>

The spot market remained firm, with Dafeng and Heng selling 70 taels to silver shops at a premium of 16 yuan, with a buying price premium of 12 yuan. Tianjin goods had a premium of 14 yuan, but there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Trading within the market was limited. In summary, Qingfa, Yongda, Decheng, Shengyuan, Yongtong, and Yurun slightly increased, while Hengchang, Yongda, Changxiang, Xianghe, and Hengyu slightly sold.

<p>British and American Exchange Rates Continue to Strengthen; Chinese Merchants Still Covering East Exchange</p>
<p>The exchange market was quiet yesterday, continuing to trend towards easing. Forward rates were even stronger. The morning began with overseas telegrams reporting that London large and small strips were stable, New York markets were closed, London gold remained unchanged, the British pound fell by 1.25 against the US dollar, and the British pound remained unchanged against the French franc and the Japanese yen. The Central Bank's exchange rate announcement showed stability for both British and American currencies. The customs gold unit remained unchanged. The exchange market opened in the morning with the near-term selling price of British exchange at 1 shilling, 2 pence, 5625, and US exchange at 29.6875 yuan, the same as the previous close for both British and American currencies. After the opening, the supply from banks exceeded demand. Although foreign firms were buying, HSBC's exchange rate announcement showed stability for both British and American currencies, and the silver balancing tax remained unchanged. Although there were moments of stability, the trend gradually eased. Banks took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions. The market fluctuated at noon, and there were few changes in the afternoon market. Although Chinese merchants were covering East exchange, Japanese banks were actively selling. There were rumors that foreign banks were buying Guangdong currency, but the exchange market was not significantly affected. The closing near-term selling price was 0.015625 lower for the British pound and 0.03125 lower for the US dollar compared to the close. The far-term was 0.03125 lower for the British pound and 0.0625 higher for the US dollar. Foreign firms actively settled their positions, while Chinese merchants were still covering East exchange. The following is a record of today's transactions:</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Flour Industry Continues to See External Arbitrage</p>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday morning, the market for each month presented a peaceful and stable appearance. Considering the foreign wheat quotes, Chicago market was closed, Canada was nearly 0.25 points down, also 0.875 points. Liverpool fell 1 penny and zero, so after the opening price, the market atmosphere for each month showed a slight fatigue, about 7.5 points lower than the previous day. However, although this month is near delivery, most of the long and short chips have already been prepared, so initially seeing a slight decrease, it then rebounded. Below March, transactions were not smooth, both sides expanded mutually, but external parties still absorbed, so it improved slightly. By the time the afternoon market opened, this month only had 1.5 days of trading, and floating long positions continued to be sold, and it was reported that inland factories had a small number of deliveries, which made people's hearts quiet again. March and April saw continued rises due to external arbitrage. Observing the current situation, this month will become the past, and the competition has been reduced, so it can pass peacefully.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Fluctuate and Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market, after the opening in the morning, the market for each month generally presented a hovering appearance. Although foreign wheat saw a slight decrease, there was still little inward attention. Because this month only had two days of trading, long positions slightly sold off due to reduced receipt of goods, and far-term transactions were quiet, with little difference from the previous day. Nearing the afternoon opening, February and March saw long positions still not too close, with slight selling, decreasing by 0.125 to 0.25 points, and the remaining months were calm, with ups and downs. As for the spot wheat market, high prices were due to insufficient inventory, with a price of 0.7 yuan, but there were no transactions. Only more than 1,000 bags of Kai Chao wheat were opened, with a price of 6.1 yuan. As for the standard for this month, because spot goods were still popular and could be particularly high, it would not be too soft.</p>
<p>Customer Indica Sales Turn Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, customer indica arrivals and sales were half and half, and the market turned to a stalemate. The total number of transactions throughout the day still reached more than 15,000 bags, but the Guangdong appetite had slackened. The Austrian gang's transactions were less than half. Although the Shantou gang on this street continued to be active, in the end, their stomach for business was not as strong as the Guangdong gang, so the rising wind had been frustrated. If today and tomorrow Guangdong chemical industry continues to activate the market, it may be able to expand again, or then with consecutive days of arrivals, the market must turn half and half. Throughout the day, 9,217 bags of Gan rice, 1,500 bags of Han coarse rice, 150 bags of Shashi rice, and 3,140 bags of Xiang rice were opened.</p>
<p>White Japonica Boat Households Cut Prices to Sell</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were more than 20 boat households from various roads under the river. The sales of various goods on the market, white japonica customers wanted to sell quickly, and the price was a few cents lower. Early rice prices were also nearly a corner lower, and the top price of thin rice showed a weak trend, while medium and secondary prices were a corner lower. The prices of other goods were stable. However, Baiyuan goods were rare and sold well, and the price increased by a few cents.</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were 24 or 25 sources of goods, totaling 5,100 or 200 dan, of which thin rice accounted for the majority. Therefore, the thin rice market, Li Jing Xi'an gang contracted to handle more than 1,000 bags, but the market was only in a stable situation. Thick japonica sales were normal, but due to the rain, people's hearts were stronger, and the incoming goods were not many, so the price saw a few points of tightness. The later market situation seemed to be hovering. The supply and demand of Du Yang pointed rice were similar, with little ups and downs, and the Yin Bian Yuan was firm.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Coarse Sand White Continues to Fall by 0.05 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, the foreign sugar market still showed a weak appearance. The guild's price was 22.85 yuan for coarse sand white and 7.45 yuan for transit, both down by 0.05 yuan and transactions were light. Dongbai was also down by 0.05 yuan, such as No. 4 at 23 yuan, transit 7.55 yuan, No. 8 at 22.55 yuan, transit 7.7 yuan, YRO at 22.45 yuan, transit 7.4 yuan, all untraded. The original price of cotton white from this factory was unchanged, but the atmosphere of domestic sugar was uniquely good. The Chao gang number house continued to open Ti Zhuang Qing and Huanggang more than 200 bags, the price of Yu Ji brand Ti Qing 14.8 yuan, Huanggang 14.3 yuan, Khmer red more than 100 bags, the price of 16.1 yuan, 15.8 yuan. The Xinghua gang opened more than 100 bags of Da Gong Fen, the price of 20.045 yuan, 20.04 yuan, Gao Ming Jing more than 200 bags, the price of 15 yuan to 15.2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Transactions Less Than Fifty Bales</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk market, because the United States was Washington's birthday, New York was closed and there was no market. In Lyon, the day silk 13.15-strip per mixed material was compared to the previous Zhang half France Lang. Shanghai silk AB grade in France sales disk still opened at the original price, with little change in more than ten days. Yokohama silk market, the standard silk spot fell by 1 yuan, futures fell by 3 yuan, and people's hearts seemed to be loosening. The situation in Shenshi was still fresh and active, and foreign Zhuang users rarely asked. Yesterday, only French Zhuang had a slight transaction, and Indian Zhuang local silk also had only sporadic transactions. Local users in this port slightly transacted yesterday, and the price was still good and bad, with a total of 45 bales traded.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>New Banknotes Continue to Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the British ship Sudan imported 200 boxes of banknotes from London, all of which were 1-yuan and 5-yuan notes, accounting for more than 10,000 pounds. It is reported that another 90 boxes, accounting for more than 7,600 pounds, have been unloaded in Hong Kong and transferred to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Follows Yarn Market, Weak and Soft</p>
<p>Wholesale Transactions on This Street Are Very Busy</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market was slightly soft, which was caused by the weakness of the yarn market. Dong Huo's fine cloth and fine twill were sold off by large retailers and fell back (per piece) 0.025 yuan. Only 84 original cloth is now woven exclusively by Toyota Factory. Due to the impact of the strike, the goods are in short supply and the price is high, continuing to rise (per piece) 0.025 yuan. Qingdao goods, such as fine cloth Bianlongzhu and Huaniao brands, etc., are expensive at the place of origin. The original orders in Shanghai Port were resold to Tianjin, and the number was very large. Yesterday, there were continued transactions of more than 400 packages, and the price rose (per piece) 0.025 yuan, which were futures for March and April, directly loaded from Qingdao to Tianjin. Retail sales in local stores were not prosperous due to the New Year and rainy days, but the purchase of goods was quite strong, and inland help was also consistently added. Most of them were the first batch of additions, with a wide variety of items and a larger quantity than usual, so the wholesale Zhuang on this street suddenly became busy, and large numbers of zero pieces were shipped out every day, and customer roads were also improving. The original pieces also sold well.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>British Steel Plates Sell Well</p>
<p>The trend of British steel plates at the end of last year was very good due to the crazy purchases in Qingdao. Recently, factories and customer routes in this street, such as Sichuan, Hankou, Fujian, and Shantou, have successively purchased, so the market price is much better than before. The current market price of 0.25-inch is 18.5 yuan, 0.5-inch is 14 yuan, 0.75-inch is 13 yuan, and 1-inch is 12.5 yuan. Although it is rainy, the number of transactions still reaches 1,000 to 2,000 pieces.</p>
<p>White Lead Sheet Rising Wind Steeps</p>
<p>▲17 Pounds Higher Than the Lowest Price</p>
<p>White lead sheet prices have been soaring in recent days due to frantic telegrams from overseas. The estimated price per ton is 33 pounds, which is as much as 17 pounds higher than the previous lowest price, so general hoarders and factories and colleagues are scrambling to collect them, and transactions are extraordinarily strong, resulting in supply not meeting demand, the market atmosphere becoming tighter, and the market price becoming firmer. The current market price, such as No. 2, is estimated at 160 yuan, Nos. 3 and 4 are estimated at 164 yuan, No. 5 is estimated at 162 yuan, No. 6 is 160 yuan, No. 7 is 161 yuan, No. 8 is 158 yuan, No. 9 is 150 yuan, and No. 10 is 151.5 yuan. The price of thick Zhuang color per barrel is estimated at about 140 yuan. A survey found that the inventory in this port is extremely small, and the minds of colleagues are very good, so the future market standard is expected to rise again. According to people in the industry, if overseas pricing continues to rise, then the estimated price in this port may still be better.</p>

<p>National Products Special Edition</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Contributing to the Future of National Products</h3>
<p>— Yang Yan</p>
<p>National products today can be said to be known by the whole country, and can be used by the whole country. Even children feel that clothing, food, housing, and transportation should all use national products. However, looking back and thinking about the future of national products, it is not yet optimistic, and it has not yet stepped onto a smooth path.</p>
<p>First, imports seemed to decrease last year, but the import surplus was still more than 240 million yuan, and the amount of smuggling was not included. In January of this year, the import volume of a certain national product broke the previous record. What a dangerous phenomenon this is!</p>
<p>Second, the quality of national products has indeed improved a lot, but according to the interviews with female visitors, there are still many who are not satisfied. In the future, the improvement of technology and the reduction of costs in national product factories are very important things.</p>
<p>Third, although there are many Chinese who use national products, there are still many who are obsessed with foreign goods and only know how to use imported goods as a fashion. Especially those who have received foreign education or higher education are more likely to do so. How to make their belief in national products stronger.</p>
<p>Fourth, many Chinese in the interior want to buy national products but cannot, and it is not easy for people from outside to buy local specialties. It can be seen that the communication of domestic and foreign products has not yet been achieved. How can the mission of the China National Products United Business Company be completed?</p>
<p>Fifth, although there are many national product groups in various places, most of them are nominal and lack substance. There is a lot of superficial work, but not enough actual effort. There is a lot of formal and theoretical propaganda, but little thorough and practical results. It is very worrying that there is a lot of theory from theory, but the facts are not like this.</p>
<h3>Implementing Family National Productization</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Since the launch of family visits by our national product industry last year, and the New Year's family fun party organized by this national product group, everyone has deeply felt the necessity of national productization in every family in our country. Indeed, the family is the unit that makes up the entire society, and it is the foundation of the nation and the country. We must ensure that every family earnestly uses national products and does not use foreign products. This is the prerequisite for developing industry and commerce and prospering the national economy.</p>
<p>However, "family national productization" is a very empty term. In the past, we who advocated national products also shouted loudly, but now we should make progress and put forward concrete proposals. How can families actually implement national productization? In a narrow sense, how can every family use national products entirely? In a broad sense, how can every family, from the head of the family, the housewife to the children and servants, firmly establish the confidence to love and protect national products and always use national products?</p>
<p>Here, my opinion is that the main driving force for the effective and widespread promotion of national product families is still the housewife and the head of the family. We eagerly hope that the leaders in every family at present must be full of a strong sense of justice to love and protect national products. No matter what the supplies are, whether it is clothing, food, housing, or transportation, they should be purchased from national product companies or national product manufacturers. For example, fabrics should use Sanyou or Hongxin, silk and satin should use Meiya, family medicines should use Wuzhou, children's toys should use Kangπ, daily enamel utensils can be purchased with Lique brand, and underwear can be purchased with Goose brand. These many first-class national products must be the best companions in every family's daily life.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I also believe that national product companies and national product manufacturers themselves should arrange national product family models at any time, list exquisite products for people to visit. Famous people in society should take the lead in promoting "family national productization" and widely advocate it. This is also the main force for promoting the universal implementation of national product families in society!</p>
<p>The call for national products has been resounding for several years. Now, our only hope is that every family will be national productized.</p>
<h3>My Experience</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hu Tianzhu</p>
<p>This year is the Civil Servants National Products Year. If all civil servants in the country can earnestly implement it, the results will definitely be considerable after one year. But from my experience, the civil servants' psychology of admiring foreign things is really too deep. No matter how high the propaganda wave of the Civil Servants National Products Year is, civil servants may not give up foreign goods and use national goods. This is not my arbitrary judgment, but experience.</p>
<p>I have worked as a civil servant for a few months. Among the twenty-odd employees in that organization, only one-sixth of the employees did not use foreign goods. The remaining five-sixths of the employees, although not using foreign goods for everything, used imported products for nine out of ten items. Moreover, the higher the position, the more foreign goods are used. It is the lower-level employees who are the real advocates of national products.</p>
<p>Civil servants' skills in "complying in public and opposing in private" can be said to be superior. It is really admirable! In the year before the Civil Servants National Products Year, the organization where I worked received an instruction from the higher-level organization, ordering all employees in the organization to use national products, and those who violated it would be punished. The chief received this instruction and immediately ordered it to be followed. But this chief was originally the most fond of foreign products. Although he ordered his subordinates to follow the order of promoting national products, he made a compromise, saying that all foreign goods that had already been purchased would be allowed to be used as before, and no more purchases would be allowed in the future. In this way, the so-called promotion of national products is only good to hear on the surface! Because these civil servants who use foreign goods can say that they bought it a long time ago, and there is no way to verify it. So, it is really deplorable for civil servants like this to promote national products!</p>
<p>The chief of that organization opened the door of convenience for promoting national products, and employees could of course say that the newly bought foreign goods were old ones. But after all, they did not dare to buy them openly, for fear that the chief would punish them for this. So they asked their wives or brothers to come forward to buy them, and that would be foolproof. Because I was a female employee, I often went to the official residences of the employees to play with their wives, so I knew the inside story of their buying foreign goods. I once persuaded them and them with painstaking words, but to no avail. Instead, they blamed me for meddling. Only the wife of a section member was persuaded by me to understand, and she turned to negotiate with her husband, not allowing him to use foreign goods anymore. When I left that organization, they had indeed not bought imported goods for half a month.</p>
<p>There was another female employee in that organization who regarded foreign goods as enemies, because her father used to open a sugar warehouse. At first, the business was good, but later, due to the impact of foreign sugar, especially × country sugar dumping, the price of domestic sugar imported fell sharply, and as a result, the sugar warehouse closed down, losing a lot of money. Her father died of worry. She often said to me: If it were not for foreign goods invading the market for national goods, how could she have lost her father at an early age? Her words were filled with sorrow! I also shed tears of sympathy. Alas! Terrible imported products!</p>
<p>This year is the Civil Servants National Products Year. I think it is very important to promote the pros and cons of national products. But the most important thing is that the chief of the organization should take the lead by example, and should often conduct clear and secret investigations on the employees under his command. If there is anyone who complies in public and opposes in private, he should be dismissed immediately. With this method, I really don't believe that there will be no results in the Civil Servants National Products Year. If the higher-level organization only issues a document of instruction, it is considered to be promoting national products, and the chiefs and employees in the lower-level organizations all comply in public and oppose in private, and use imported products as before, then it would be a joke!</p>
<h3>A Little Experience from Family Visitors</h3>
<p>1.  Complaints that national products are priced too high.</p>
<p>2.  Should compile and print national product catalogs with simple descriptions.</p>
<p>3.  Sales staff should pay attention to courtesy.</p>
<p>4.  Regarding the knowledge of distinguishing national products, attention should be paid to shopping guidance.</p>
<p>5.  Housewives should have close relationships with factories. Encourage housewives to visit factories.</p>
<h3>Promoting National Products and Relieving Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Yesterday (February 23) was International Unemployment Day, and unemployed workers all over the world organized petition teams to ask the government authorities to give them bread and survival. This is indeed something worth noting.</p>
<p>As for the unemployment problem in our China, it is really getting more and more serious now! According to the Shenbao record on a certain day in 1936, the number of unemployed workers alone was more than 5.8 million (not including unemployed intellectuals). This is another thing worth noting!</p>
<p>How to enable unemployed people to have the opportunity to serve the society and contribute their abilities? How to reduce the current serious unemployment problem to the lowest limit? This is not only a problem that the government should be responsible for solving, but also a problem that the general public should pay attention to.</p>
<p>From my humble opinion, we should not only hope that the government will comprehensively plan a specific plan and relief plan for the method of relieving unemployment; at the same time, we also hope that the general adults and gentlemen in society who have the power to employ people will appropriately employ more people within the possible scope to gradually reduce the number of unemployed people: on the other hand, we especially hope that compatriots all over the country will unanimously promote national products and use national products. For all the needs of life, we should take the use of national products as the principle. We believe that the use of national products is the obligation that citizens should bear and the duty that they should fulfill. If everyone can adopt this determination, not only can the future of the national product industry be infinitely developed, but also the general national product factories can also sell their products well, actively expand, and mass-produce as a result. Under this situation, a factory that originally only used 200 workers must now use 300 or 400 workers to cope with the work. If all the national product factories in the country can do this, then the result will definitely be to reduce many of the unemployed in the unemployed group, and the so-called serious unemployment problem will certainly be gradually resolved. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>Therefore, I deeply feel that promoting national products is indeed an effective way to relieve unemployment. Using national products is indeed a great work to save oneself, save others, save the country, and save the nation. To solve this increasingly serious unemployment problem, we must enable our unemployed relatives and friends to serve the society and get the opportunity to work. The prerequisite is to promote national products and start with using national products. There is no doubt or hesitation about this. What do you think of this?</p>

<p>▲The National Handicraft Exhibition will close on May 1st, and local previews will be held in mid-March first.</p>
<h3>Introduction to Four Key Techniques of Japanese Salesmanship</h3>
<p>— Nian Fen</p>
<p>Promoting national products and developing business certainly depend on the excellence of the products, but excellent sales methods are also very important. Japan's ability to dominate the world and its thriving commerce are due to the sophistication of its sales techniques. Generally speaking, the key to promoting trade lies in winning over customers, ensuring that they are sincerely pleased and convinced, creating a subconscious desire to return. This is similar to the strategy of "winning hearts is paramount" in military tactics. Here are a few examples of Japanese sales methods:</p>
<p>1. Warm and Enthusiastic Attitude – Before customers enter Japanese stores, the staff greets them with a warm and cheerful welcome. If you pause at the store entrance, they will call out, "Please come in!" Once inside, they will ask what you need, and if they have it, they will quickly bring it out, allowing you to choose freely. Regardless of the amount purchased, they always express gratitude with a "Thank you." If you don't find what you like, the staff will show a look of apology and say to the customer, "Our selection is limited, and we are sorry that we cannot satisfy you. We hope you will forgive us."</p>
<p>2. Attentive Service – Larger Japanese department stores such as Mitsukoshi, Matsuzakaya, and Shirokiya provide multiple shuttle cars that stop near train stations or busy city centers, allowing customers to ride for free to the store entrance at any time. After purchasing goods, they also offer free transportation to your designated location. Upon arrival, the female attendant in the car will say farewell with, "Thank you for your patronage. We hope you will visit our store again." Wouldn't you feel comfortable and satisfied shopping like that!</p>
<p>The Japanese are truly meticulous in their plans to facilitate customers. In addition to the aforementioned car service, they also offer two options: free delivery of parcels and daily delivery of daily necessities. The former considers that some customers may have other errands and cannot go straight home. Carrying parcels would be cumbersome, so they have a special parcel delivery service. Customers can write down the address and ask the store to deliver the parcels, ensuring safe arrival at home without any concerns about switching, missing, or losing valuables, which is extremely convenient. The latter is designed to facilitate housewives' purchase of daily necessities. Items such as rice, vegetables, meat, oil, and salt… etc., are essential for every household every day, and it is inconvenient for housewives to go to the market every day. Therefore, these stores send staff on bicycles to each household every morning to inquire about their needs. If anything is missing, the staff can deliver the required quantity on time, and credit is available, but the balance must be settled monthly. This way, housewives do not have to go out in person every day and go to the trouble.</p>
<p>3. Complete Facilities – Larger stores are very particular about their interior facilities. They have multiple elevators for customers to use at any time. There are also rest areas where customers can relax while waiting for friends and family. There are cafeterias where you can order economical food and drinks, and there are restrooms and washrooms for customers to use.</p>
<p>4. Strict Adherence to Credit – The Japanese are very reliable in their adherence to scheduled credit in commercial trade, both domestically and internationally. For example, if a contract is signed or the store is notified to deliver goods on a certain date, the goods will be prepared in advance, ensuring that customers will not be disappointed.</p>
<h3>Recollections of the Women's National Products Association Meeting</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>Before February, the local National Products Movement Association, seeing that the past promotion of national products had not been entirely satisfactory, invited many leaders in women's circles and many prominent figures' wives and daughters to hold a "Women's National Products Association Meeting" to promote it on a grand scale. At the same time, they also collected many national products from famous factories to give to the guests as encouragement. As a result, the participants were numerous and enthusiastic. The author was also among those invited. In addition to hearing the famous speeches and party doctrines of the predecessors and receiving exquisite gifts from various factories, I also observed the scene and felt compelled to speak. I had intended to write this article earlier to inform my sisters, but I was too busy with my duties to pick up a pen. Now that I have some leisure, I will briefly describe what I saw. I hope readers will not criticize me for presenting yesterday's news.</p>
<p>Today, thanks to the tireless "promotion" and "encouragement" of national products by our predecessors, many people have a small impression of "national products" in their minds. However, there are still many who are "completely clueless" about what "national products" are. Not to mention ordinary women, who have always held the "unbreakable" mentality of buying "foreign cloth," "foreign socks," "foreign umbrellas," etc., so they naturally don't know what "national products" are. Even women in intellectual circles have been deeply poisoned by "Europeanization" and "imported goods." As a result, the import numbers of cotton and wool textiles, cosmetics, and perfumes continue to increase alarmingly. Therefore, people generally put the heavy responsibility of "using national products rests on women" on our shoulders, which is indeed undeniable.</p>
<p>Therefore, the National Products Association specially invited women and implored prominent figures to earnestly advise us. The purpose was to make us realize that "women are half of the nation and should also share the responsibility of saving the country," and "consistently using national products is the key to saving the country." After hearing this lesson, we should "humbly accept" it, "introspect," and truly take on this great responsibility to save us from this serious "national crisis." (To be continued)</p>

<p>Common Ailments of Youth</p>
<h3>Nocturnal Emissions and Underdevelopment Due to Masturbation</h3>
<p>If not treated early, many harms will arise</p>
<p>During the period when spring feelings are aroused, most young people indulge in masturbation. There are quite a few people who become particularly weak due to excessive masturbation. Therefore, it is necessary to provide medical advice to those who have fallen into the harmful habit of excessive masturbation, emphasize its harm, and use effective symptomatic medicines to reduce all the diseases caused by masturbation and nocturnal emissions, such as neurasthenia and underdevelopment.</p>
<p>Once a young person indulges in masturbation, it is inevitable that the sperm gate will be damaged, leading to frequent nocturnal emissions, and thus all kinds of harms will follow. According to current medical science, it proves that the harm of masturbation not only promotes neurasthenia, but also physical weakness, kidney weakness, gastrointestinal disorders, and local underdevelopment. These are all direct effects of the bad habit or are caused by indirect relationships.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned diseases are almost unavoidable for young people who masturbate. If not cured early, they will hinder the happiness between husband and wife when they get married in the future, and even the diseases they originally suffered will become worse.</p>
<p>Normally healthy young people usually experience a decrease in sexual desire after excessive mental activity, but the result is the opposite for those who are accustomed to masturbation. Mental overwork will cause phenomena such as nocturnal emissions and spermatorrhea. If there is excessive injury during childhood, then the reproductive glands will lose their prosperity, resulting in poor development.</p>
<p>A. Tasedalalod M.D., a world-renowned venereologist, has done a lot of research on nocturnal emissions in youth pathology, so his attainments are profound. According to Dr. Ai, "Himitoto's Sperm-Strengthening Tablets" are the most effective for curing nocturnal emissions. At the same time, use the gonadal hormone preparation "Germogen" to treat neurasthenia and underdevelopment caused by masturbation and nocturnal emissions. Then the effect will be very fast. At the same time, British famous doctor Bailey Lun and American Dr. Ichaig both recommend this therapy, because these two doctors have used these two medicines to cure young people's nocturnal emissions for many years without a single failure. Therefore, the European and American medical circles have unanimously praised the efficacy of these two famous medicines. Its proven effects are threefold: 1. The effect is rapid and there is no harm. 2. It is simple and easy to implement without feeling pain. 3. The nature is not greasy or dry, and it is suitable for all seasons. Moreover, the efficacy of "Germogen" is of great help to the elderly and weak, because it can help the various tissues in the body to restore the vigor of youth and increase the ability to resist diseases. Therefore, if men and women who are in decline regularly take "Germogen," they can indeed restore the energy of their youth and increase their lifespan. All kinds of sufferings in old age can be suddenly relieved.</p>
<h3>Research on Gonorrhea: A Short-Term Cure for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>▼……"Antilin" is indeed effective for local membrane-penetrating sterilization and systemically increasing anti-lymphatic function.</p>
<p>▼……Patients in the acute phase can be completely cured in at most ten days or so. This has been confirmed by clinical doctors.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea, also known as leucorrhea, is difficult to cure. The reason for this is not due to the particularly vicious nature of the disease. In a simple sentence, it is really because there is no reliable new method of invention. If you compare gonorrhea with syphilis, you can understand that the viciousness and danger of syphilis are indeed several times greater than gonorrhea. But since the invention of 606, doctors believe that the reason why syphilis is difficult to treat no longer exists. At the same time, the difficulty of treating gonorrhea has replaced syphilis and occupies the primary position among venereal diseases. From this, it is not difficult to guess that the crux of the difficulty in curing is not the disease itself, but the research and improvement of drugs. European and American scientists deeply understand this, so they have been researching the treatment of this disease, especially the invention of drugs, and they have made great efforts. The first choice for the treatment of gonorrhea, which is now popular in the Chinese and foreign medical circles, is the "Antilin" combination preparation of flavin and vacxin, because it does have the power to penetrate the membrane and sterilize and increase anti-lymphatic factors, and it does not harm the stomach and intestines and has no drawbacks of any side effects. Therefore, gonorrhea experts from various countries, such as German Dr. Berini, British Dr. Weiniqi, French Dr. Scbipan Hanind M.D., and British Dr. Jon Edison, all unanimously praised the confirmed efficacy of the drug, which can be compared with the results of 606 in treating syphilis, especially for the best assurance of curing and not recurring, and is the best of all combined preparations. Because of the confirmed effect of this combined preparation, the difficulty of using gonorrhea in the past can be easily solved after taking the drug.</p>
<p>If a patient takes "Antilin" during the acute phase after contracting gonorrhea, it can be completely cured in at most ten days or so, and it can be prevented from being transmitted to his wife. If you miss this opportunity, gonorrhea will enter the subacute phase. At this time, if the patient is negligent and delays treatment, mistakenly taking inferior medicines, gonorrhea will invade the posterior urethra and can cause posterior urethritis. In addition, if the testicles are swollen, then you will suffer from gonococcal epididymitis; if gonorrhea invades the prostate, it will cause gonococcal prostatitis. Therefore, if this disease is not completely cured, it will be infinitely harmful! If your wife has been infected, the couple should take "Antilin" together, and the woman should use "Therapy Tape" externally to remove gonorrheal leucorrhea, which can still be completely cured.</p>

<h3>Practical Methods to Save Aging</h3>
<p>▼……Both physical and mental health must be considered</p>
<p>▼……Strengthening the reproductive glands is a good way to prevent aging</p>
<p>To save aging, it is difficult to say that it is foolproof to pay attention only to the aging of the body. The aging of the spirit is the main cause of aging, so there are not a few people in the world whose bodies are aging but whose spirits are like those of young people. On the contrary, it is not uncommon for people whose bodies are healthy but whose spirits are abnormally decadent. From this point, we know that to save aging, we must take care of both the spirit and the body, which can be said to be a real success.</p>
<p>The cause of aging is closely related to the activity of the body's cells and the loss of health of the reproductive glands, and the prosperity of the reproductive glands is also very important for longevity.</p>
<p>The reproductive glands are indeed closely related to our aging, so if the endocrine of the reproductive glands can be permanently vigorous, aging can be prevented. Or if an already aging person takes the gonadal hormone preparation "Germogen," the weakened reproductive glands can be restored to prosperity, and the person's body and spirit can be rejuvenated. Male and female "Germogen" can strengthen men's testicles and enhance women's ovarian function. After this, all the aging organs of the body can be properly and fully rejuvenated, and a large amount of toxic metabolites can be discharged from the body, helping the central nervous system and sensory organs to eliminate fatigue, blood is vigorous, and circulation is proper, which can reduce the pressure of physical and mental fatigue on the elderly and weak. Therefore, after middle-aged people take this preparation, youth can stay and it is not easy to age. After the elderly take this preparation, they can increase the body's tonic and disease-resistant power, so they can reduce the pain of old age and ill health. The famous German physiologist Dr. Marinte and the British famous doctor Dr. Weiniqi et al. have used "Germogen" to cure aging. According to them, there has not been a single failure in the past few years. From this observation, the drug does have amazing results in saving aging.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Life and Death</h3>
<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>Life is troublesome, death is quiet</p>
<p>However, "it is better to live poorly than to die well," people respect their own lives and hate the coming of death. They are constantly fighting for their own survival, and they are passionately in love with this world.</p>
<p>All the disputes and disturbances in society today can be said to be completely battles between life and death. Everyone sacrifices and kills others for the sake of their own survival. Therefore, this world is cruel and sinful.</p>
<p>Although, all the civilization and progress of mankind depends on everyone constantly using the vitality of their lives to win the harvest of war with nature and everything. If anyone feels that life is tasteless, then the whole world will die.</p>
<p>Therefore, we cannot be greedy for life or afraid of death. Before breathing stops, we should all strive to fight for ourselves, for society, and for the nation. We must inherit the track that our predecessors did not finish, and we must build a better environment for future generations.</p>
<h3>The Art of Elephant Hunting</h3>
<p>— Wu Binghe</p>
<p>Humans are indeed clever, and there are ways to capture even such huge beasts as elephants. I remember that in a movie called "Subduing the Dragon and Taming the Tiger," we were told about the method of elephant hunting. That is to use trained elephants to act as "elephant traitors," luring a group of wild elephants into a prefabricated trap, and then tying a wild elephant between two trained elephants, capturing them one by one. Seeing the giant beasts surrendering, I couldn't help but laugh.</p>
<p>However, after careful consideration, I found similar things everywhere, and the art of elephant hunting is being applied everywhere. For example, if the factory owner wants to control the workers, he does not need to bother himself, he only needs to spend a little money to hire a few foremen. Because the foremen's control of the workers is more thorough and strict than the factory owner's. If the factory owner thinks that the workers' production is too little, he only needs to signal the foreman, and he will immediately exert his authority to urge the workers to work twice as hard. The foremen are the kind of people who tame elephants.</p>
<p>If the imperialist countries want to engage in economic aggression in China, Chinese compradors are indispensable. Because he will tell them about the customs, habits and hobbies of the Chinese, so that the goods they produce can suit the tastes of the Chinese. Chinese compradors are similar to trained elephants.</p>
<p>If the imperialist countries have political ambitions and want to further occupy or rule China, then the method of provoking civil war and using Chinese to control Chinese is very effective. This is more beneficial than doing it themselves. Li Shouxin and Wang Ying in the Suiyuan War were responsible for the same task as trained elephants.</p>
<p>Therefore, the more civilized and intelligent humans are, the more this art of elephant hunting, which uses people of the same kind to control people of the same kind, will be performed endlessly.</p>
<h3>The Old People's Association of Shatou Town, Taicang</h3>
<p>— Fan Xianwei</p>
<p>In recent years, disasters have occurred frequently, and the atmosphere of depression has enveloped the entire countryside. Farmers are looking up at the roof, and nine out of ten families are empty. People in the east are clamoring, "It's hard to eat," and people in the west are clamoring, "It's hard to eat." This is about survival. Who knows, it's really unaffordable to die now. Clothes, coffins, and shrouds all require money. If ordinary families have no permanent property and no savings, and suddenly a family misfortune occurs and a patient dies, they are really at a loss and wish they could cut off their intestines. They wish they could pickle the dead person, so the problem of burial is also very tricky at present, and there is no way!</p>
<p>Recently, a group of caring people in my hometown (Shatou, Taicang) have initiated a mutual aid association called the Old People's Association. The method is very simple. It does not distinguish between occupations or gender (presumably, the younger generation saves for the elders). At the beginning, a leader gathered one hundred members. Each member pays one yuan from beginning to end, without drawing lots or winning prizes, and there is no fixed date for withdrawal. After joining, each member receives a certificate to show credibility. The funds are deposited in a reliable local business for interest. Later, when one of the members dies, it is the date of the second withdrawal. On that day, the leader withdraws the previous funds and gives them to the family of the deceased for use. Within seven days, the funds are collected again and deposited in the same way for future use. The method is easy and quick, unlike the troubles of the old-fashioned Old People's Association, because after this association collects the money, it is considered to have withdrawn from the association and does not need to pay another penny (if the family has another elderly person, they can continue to join). The leader finds a "new member" to fill the position, so the earlier you die, the earlier you receive the money, the cheaper it is. But after all, no one in the younger generation wants their elders to die early!</p>
<p>In today's bankrupt rural areas, this kind of mutual aid association is indeed worthy of emulation everywhere!</p>
<h3>Jilin Ginseng</h3>
<p>— Li Guang</p>
<p>A few days ago, I received a letter from home saying that my mother's health was getting weaker and weaker, and she wanted me to buy some tonics for her. Yes, she is an old woman in her eighties, and she needs some tonics. What kind of tonic is good? So I thought of ginseng, and then I thought of Jilin ginseng.</p>
<p>Ginseng is the best tonic in Chinese medicine. There is so-called "Korean ginseng" and "Jilin ginseng," which are distinguished by the producing area. Jilin ginseng is one of Jilin's special products. It is produced in the depths of the mountains and forests. It cannot grow if it is sheltered by trees and there is no sunlight.</p>
<p>Ginseng is a perennial herb. It is very precious if it grows to be fifty or sixty years old and slightly resembles the shape of a human. According to its growth process, it can be divided into six periods: one to five years, it grows one palmate leaf, commonly known as "Bazhangzi"; five to ten years, it grows two leaves, called "Erlaizi"; twenty years, it grows three leaves, called "Santaizi"; thirty years, it grows four leaves, called "Sipinye"; from forty to sixty years, it goes through the "Wupinye" and "Liupinye" periods, and naturally grows six leaves. If the head and tail of the root are complete, it is truly a precious thing.</p>
<p>It is said that most of the ginseng pickers have always been people from Hebei and Shanxi provinces within the Pass. They go to pick ginseng, and about ten or twenty people form a small team, carrying weapons with them to defend against thieves or animal attacks, just like exploring. Each team proceeds in a straight line with a distance of more than a hundred steps between each person, echoing each other to avoid losing contact. If one of them finds ginseng seedlings, he shouts "Bangchui!" His companions ask, "What kind of Bangchui?" The one who found it inspects its shape and determines what kind it belongs to, and then answers "a certain kind of Bangchui." Everyone swarms forward and shouts "Take it!" in unison. Then, the ginseng seedlings are tied with red thread, covered with oilcloth, and carefully dug out with a bamboo knife to avoid damaging the roots and whiskers. If it cannot be done in one or two days, they will stay there until all of it is taken out. Sacrifices are set up to thank the mountain gods. If they are very lucky and get six-leaf ginseng, they must use a whole lamb as a sacrifice. This kind of harvesting method seems to have a superstitious meaning. However, since the loss of the Northeast, the right to pick ginseng has fallen into the hands of people from "friendly countries."</p>
<p>Currently, wild mountain ginseng in major pharmacies in Shanghai costs fifty or sixty yuan per tael, and the cheapest ones cost more than ten yuan, which makes me hesitate.</p>
<h3>Changing the Nest and Bringing the Phoenix</h3>
<p>— By Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven (Murmured Gratitude to a Kind Mother, Confession of Love and Devotion, Autumn Light Dims Emerald Brows, Evoking Sentiments upon the Scene)</p>
<p>Little Ju brought the snacks to Menglan, letting her take them, and said with a smile, "Madam was delayed for some time searching for the key to open the tea cabinet. She quickly arranged the plates and told me to bring them over quickly, so that Second Young Mistress and Miss wouldn't have to wait for long." Second Young Mistress saw that the plates contained two dishes of Western-style pastries, one dish of pine nut candies, and a dish of sugared plums. She then smiled and said, "We just wanted something to refresh our mouths; Mother is treating us like guests." Little Ju stood to one side and said, "There are also melon seeds and peanut kernels at home. Madam said that Miss likes to be clean and is afraid of making the upstairs dirty, so she didn't send them over. Does Miss want them?" Menglan smiled and said, "Do you really think she's treating us like honored guests?" As she spoke, she turned her head back and said to Second Young Mistress, "This is all thoughtful and meticulous. The old lady knows what I like to eat, but it's only a few things." Second Young Mistress said, "Of course! Is there a mother who doesn't know what her daughter likes? And that goes the other way too. A daughter should know her mother just as well." Menglan paused, then sighed and said, "If we're talking about that, then I'm a sinner. Although I know my mother's temperament, I can't share her worries or relieve her troubles. To put it more bluntly, I've added to her troubles quite a bit." Second Young Mistress picked up a piece of pine nut candy, held it with three fingers, and slowly put it in her mouth to chew. She just looked at Menglan, but didn't say a word. Menglan watched her eat the candy, also picked up a piece in her hand, but didn't put it in her mouth to eat; instead, she put it back down. She then said, "My parents treat me with extreme love and kindness." As she said this, she let out a long sigh. Second Young Mistress smiled and said, "Since your parents both love you, that's a good thing, why is Sister sighing?" Menglan said, "I'm not saying that my parents shouldn't love me, it's just that their love is wasted." Second Young Mistress said, "What do you mean by that? I don't quite understand." Menglan said, "Second Sister-in-law, if you really want me to say it, then I'll say it. I feel dissatisfied everywhere because my marriage isn't free. It's because of this that I often make the two old people worried. I can't just act like I have no opinion and let everything go by vaguely, like the young ladies in those old families." Second Young Mistress said, "Since Sister knows this, why don't you just comply with your father and mother's wishes a little?" Menglan lowered her head and sighed again. Second Young Mistress had already eaten that piece of pine nut candy by this time. Then she got up again, picked up another piece of pine nut candy in her hand, and slowly put it in her mouth to chew. As she put it in her mouth to chew, her eyes were still glancing at Menglan a few times, seeing that she was still lowering her head, looking melancholy and silent. She then smiled and said, "This is just idle chat between sisters-in-law, we can say anything. Since you know this situation, why don't you try to compromise a bit?" Menglan sighed softly, shook her head twice, and said, "This is very difficult to say." Second Young Mistress smiled and said, "We're just chatting, who cares if it's difficult? Just tell us about it." (137)</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>Sketch of a Jai Alai Court</h3>
<p>— By Yafei</p>
<p>At night, the electric lights burst out like volcanoes. The flames of the neon lights flowed on the storefront signs, like the eyes of a passionate young woman, tempting pedestrians. In the middle of the smooth asphalt road, snake-like streetcars and beast-like buses, frog-like streamlined motorcycles, busily swam along.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the Jai Alai court on Avenue Joffre, many people were crowded together. Ring... ring... ring... a burst of sharp ticket-selling sounds came from the window, rippling in the dark streets. It heavily struck everyone's heart, making the hearts of those fans tense for a while, and relaxed for a while. Eight o'clock had passed. I followed the crowd and walked into the entrance.</p>
<p>Inside the court, all sorts of men and women, Chinese and foreign, were seated in order, but they were all quiet, without any commotion. Even if someone was talking to the person next to them, it was in a low voice. Everyone stretched their necks, focusing their sharp gaze on that white ball, and on the players wearing red and blue uniforms. Watching them busily run around under the electric lights in the square, forcefully hitting that white ball against the wall, and then against the ground, and then finally returning to their hands.</p>
<p>Once again, it was forcefully hit out, but no one on the other side caught it, but another player ran up. At that moment, a burst of commotion suddenly erupted in the crowd:</p>
<p>"Alberdi! Today Alberdi scored another four points!" Following the shouting voice, I looked up at the high stands, and saw two young gentlemen diagonally opposite me shouting like madmen.</p>
<p>"Really, Alberdi scored twice again!" As a result, Alberdi was victorious again. Immediately, a general cheer and sigh arose from the crowd in the stands. Some people even climbed out of their seats and rushed to the place to collect money; others angrily tore the red and green tickets into pieces and threw them into the corners.</p>
<p>The next ticket-selling sound was ringing again... ring... ring... Those people again handed over one yuan, five yuan, and ten yuan banknotes to the ticket seller; at the same time, they happily exchanged them for red and green tickets, everyone placing their hope on the number on that ticket.</p>
<p>"Number two is good, or Alberdi! He won alone twice today, maybe he'll win a third time!"</p>
<p>"Maybe Alberdi is having good luck..."</p>
<p>Once, twice, three times... competing, competing. Those who were triumphant raised their faces high, feeling as comfortable as if they had drunk a glass of wine. Those who failed lowered their heads, feeling as bad as if they had sipped a bowl of bittern. In the seats, many lively, worried eyes were floating around.</p>
<p>Those Spanish players gradually disappeared before my eyes. Inside the court, only the last wireless evening music was still broadcasting songs. The crowd, densely packed, flowed towards the entrance, carrying triumphant laughter and disappointed sighs, rushing onto that brown, dead snake-like long street.</p>
<h3>On the Calendar (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Cao Yixuan</p>
<p>This case was supported by the camera king Eastman, and promoted in various countries. After Eastman's death, this case also disappeared with it. In 1929, Russia also set five days as a week, abolishing the original day of rest. Generally, the days of rest differ according to the color of the labor administrator, for example, red is the 1st and 6th day, green is the 2nd and 7th day, and yellow is the 3rd and 9th day. This is very different from the European custom of taking Sunday as a day of rest. However, after implementing this system, the days of rest for husband and wife in a family were often different, so they could not enjoy family reunions. The Russian government gradually realized this problem, so it changed six days to a week, with the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, and 30th as days of rest. If a person does not rest on these days, they can rest for one day in six days. Except for the central government newspapers, all newspapers are closed on this day. However, because February has no 30th day, March 1st is the day of rest. This is because the Russian government intentionally abolished the seven-day week system from an anti-religious standpoint. Now, the Comte calendar, centered on the United States, is the most appropriate. This case was proposed by the German Fang Qihalde in 19093. It divides the year into four seasons, each season having three months of 31 days, 30 days, and 30 days. The remaining days are placed at the end of the year, and the leap day is also a day outside the week, attached to the end of June. If January 1st is Sunday, then the 1st of the first month of each season is also Sunday, the 1st of the first month is Wednesday, and the 1st of the first month is Friday, which will never change. That is, the relationship between the calendar day and Sunday is only three kinds, which is very easy to calculate. The table is as follows:</p>
<p>The above is the world calendar devised by Fang Qihalde, which separates it from the week, and the average number of days per month is also appropriate. This case will surely be adopted by the whole world in the future, because the week we use is based on the ancient Jewish tradition and Egyptian superstition. The reason why it cannot be abolished in Europe and the United States is because it has been opposed by Christians and Jews. In our country, it is originally irrelevant. It is said that this world calendar, on January 1, 1939, the 28th year of the Republic of China, happens to be Sunday. I am afraid that it can be implemented in that year. However, the trend of world public opinion is very noteworthy.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Opening up Freedom of Speech</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang recently issued a speech, listing three points to show the people of the country: first, opening up freedom of speech; second, concentrating talent; and third, pardoning political prisoners. This is enough to show Chairman Chiang's great spirit and open attitude. Regarding the opening up of freedom of speech, except for propaganda to communize, endanger the country, and leak military and diplomatic secrets, and unfounded facts and rumors, which are absolutely prohibited, all other legitimate freedom of speech is respected. This intention is what the people desire, and it is also the intention that the author has repeatedly appealed for for several years, but has not achieved. Now, at the time of the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, this kind of people's wish has been completely fulfilled. This is something that we cannot but pray for with incense and wishes.</p>
<p>In this period of political tutelage, restricting freedom of speech was originally a measure that the central government had no choice but to take, and the authorities inevitably did not want to bear the responsibility and criticism of the speech community for restricting freedom of speech. Assuming that the speech community has no complex thoughts and irresponsible speech, then the government will never restrict the opening up of speech. The government uses its high-handed methods to stifle public opinion, which originally comes from being compelled to do so. However, as a journalist, one should understand one's own responsibility for speech and the cultivation of one's character. Therefore, reporters should originally be responsible for matters such as plotting against the country, leaking secrets, and being inconsistent with the facts.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the inspection system, the responsibility for whether all speeches and news should be disclosed has been mostly given to the inspector. In order to be serious about their responsibility, the inspectors often exceed the scope prescribed by the central government when inspecting newspapers, and when the news reporters are too serious and too prudent about the inspectors, voices of criticism inevitably arise from time to time. Therefore, the position of the inspector is more difficult than that of the news reporter. If they are too lenient, they will inevitably be condemned by the central authorities, and if they are too strict, they will inevitably be blamed by the news reporters. Therefore, the difficult situation of the inspectors being caught in a dilemma cannot be expressed in words, and although the news reporters have the pain of being as silent as cicadas in winter regarding the speech in the newspapers, their responsibility is naturally attributed to them.</p>
<p>If the government clearly defines the scope and puts forward principles, then the news reporters should follow the principles, so there is no need to make the inspectors embarrassed, and the news reporters should also be absolutely responsible to the central government. Otherwise, the inspectors and the news reporters will not be able to understand the intentions of the authorities. On the inspection side, they will inspect what should not be inspected, and on the news reporter side, they will not dare to publish what should be published. As a result, the newspapers are not worth reading, and the central government takes the blame for stifling public opinion. This is also the injustice of the authorities.</p>
<p>However, the original intention of cracking down on news is nothing more than to prevent reaction and irresponsible speech. However, this kind of method can only be a negative suppression, and can never be a positive utilization. The heavenly duty of newspapers is originally to have the beautiful name of supervising the government and guiding the people. This kind of saying is originally the tone of others complimenting the news reporters, which is not enough to be taken as evidence. But in fact, newspapers are not enough to supervise the government, but for the government's measures, although the intentions are good, there are inevitable drawbacks and gaps in the application. News reporters have more pertinent observations, so they should make benevolent contributions, and the authorities may not know all the hardships of the people. If they know it but cannot be sure, the news reporters should also speak for the people and appeal for them. This is originally the responsibility of the reporters. If they are afraid of offending the government's taboos and cannot escape condemnation, then they dare not say what should be said, and they dare not publish what should be published. This is not only the reporters' loss of their heavenly duty, but it is also definitely not the original intention of the authorities towards the speech community.</p>
<h3>This Year is a "Strange" Year</h3>
<p>— Yunhai</p>
<p>I don't know when it started, but every year has a specific name to represent the characteristics of that year, such as "Women's National Goods Year," "Children's Year," "Magazine Year," "Citizens' National Goods Year," and so on. Of course, this year cannot be exempt from this custom. Only less than two months have passed this year, and the appellations of "Year" are already quite numerous, such as "Civil Servants' National Goods Year," which comes from the "National Goods Year" lineage, and "Drama Year," which has the same meaning as "Magazine Year," and even "Recovering Lost Territory Year," which has a positive patriotic meaning, and even "Year of the Ox," which is named after the zodiac sign. There are countless others. However, we think that this year can also be called "Strange" Year.</p>
<p>Regarding "strange," I believe that everyone who has read the newspaper will know; and people who read the newspaper every day will be very familiar with it. And these "strange" things were still newly discovered this year, but the number of discoveries is really too "strange." Below is a small statistic on "strange":</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM on January 1st, Yang Lin and others discovered ten "strange" warships off the coast of Haikou, which used light machine guns to sweep the beach for half an hour before stopping. At 11:00 AM on the 2nd, a "strange" plane suddenly flew over the city of Qingdao, throwing various leaflets with extremely absurd content, circling for about 20 minutes before leaving. On the same day in the afternoon, a "strange" warship arrived at Shazhou City Center Port in the 7th District of Changshu, measuring the water level, and several "strange" sailors landed. On the 8th and 9th, "strange" planes flew over Qingxian, Cangxian, Jinghai, and Daming, Yongqing, and Shijiazhuang in southern Hebei, throwing absurd leaflets. On the 19th, a Nanjing Central News Agency telegram stated: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a serious protest again due to the frequent flying of "strange" planes over Jinan at will. On the morning of the 21st, a "strange" plane circled in Tianjin for a long time, and then flew to the northwest. On the same day, a "strange" plane was also discovered over the city of Peiping. After 7:00 PM on the evening of the 29th, a "strange" warship suddenly shuttled back and forth between Baimao Port and Gaopu Port, using searchlights to illuminate the shore. On the same day, a "strange" ship near Qingdao was suspected of smuggling and refused to be searched by the sea patrol warship. At 11:15 AM on the 30th, two "strange" military planes, No. 502 and No. 140, flew to Qingdao and landed at Cangkuo Airport.</p>
<p>The above only records the appearance of strange planes and strange ships in our country's territory in January alone, which has reached ten cases, averaging one case every three days. This cannot be said to be too few. Moreover, there is also a "strange" agency with an organized background that was cracked down in Zhengzhou, which is not counted. As for February, it was quite peaceful in the first half of the month, but from the first to the second half of the month, "strange" things became active again.</p>
<p>As of the 22nd, there were a total of five cases in February. They are as follows: At 7:30 PM on the 18th, a "strange" plane was discovered over the city of Peiping, with yellow and green lights shining downward from both wings and the tail of the plane, flying low and circling for 15 minutes before flying towards the west city. At about 9:00 PM on the 19th, a "strange" plane was also discovered in Baoding, using searchlights to shine downward. At 10:25 AM on the 20th, a "strange" plane flew from Dalian to Qingdao. Also, at 11:40 AM on the same day, "strange" military plane No. 1103 flew from Tianjin to Qingdao, and then flew back to Tianjin. Also, at 5:00 PM on the same day, a "strange ship" was discovered again in the Zimao Port of Changshu's 6th District, opening machine guns towards the outside of the beach for ten minutes.</p>
<p>The territory is China's territory, and military planes can land at will, and even warships can sail in inland rivers and open light machine guns to sweep the shore. It is not only that the "plane" and "ship" can be said to be "strange", but these things cannot be said to be "strange" things. However, it seems that it is not strange that similar "strange" things happen in our country. Don't we see? In less than two months, there have been as many as fifteen cases, and there are even three cases that occurred on the same day. Isn't this "strange" no longer strange? At the same time, the so-called "strange" also has an air of entering the hall, for example, in Qingdao, it used to appear in the sky, but now it actually lands. This cannot be said to be "strange" and "strange" again.</p>
<p>Only one-sixth of this year has passed, and there are already so many "strange" things, what can we imagine later? If this year is not a "strange" year, then what is it? However, it is not very good to have too many "strange" things. I only hope that with our "unified" strength, we can cancel the name of the "strange" year.</p>

<h3>Zombie Appears?</h3>
<p>— Liu Shangyi</p>
<p>Recently, an uncorrupted female corpse of thirteen years was discovered in the fields of Zhanghuabang in Wusong. Superstitious people therefore regarded it as a cursed zombie, and even spread rumors that it appears at night. This is really very ridiculous.</p>
<p>I remember when I used to live in the countryside, there were also rumors that a zombie had appeared. A neighbor even said that he had seen it with his own eyes, and told me in detail what the zombie looked like and how it moved, vividly depicting it, making it difficult for me to sleep peacefully at night. I often felt ghostly figures looming in the darkness, and later I had to move to the city. It turned out that I was suffering from a very severe case of neurasthenia at that time.</p>
<p>Now my body is strong and healthy, my spirits are better than ever, and my old illnesses have completely disappeared, because I take "Earth Brand Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil" every day, so it has a great tonic effect. Thinking of my timidity in the past, I am really like two different people.</p>

<h3>Confused</h3>
<p>— Luo</p>
<p>My colleague Hu Gutian is now called Confused by everyone: the name Gutian has gradually become unfamiliar. However, Mr. Hu Gutian is not as confused as his nickname suggests, and he is one of the most astute and clever colleagues, and he is also kind and approachable. The origin of the nickname Confused has the following story:</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Gutian has a girlfriend, and they have already progressed to the stage of discussing marriage. One Saturday morning, that young lady called Mr. Hu Gutian to ask him to go to the movies. Naturally, Mr. Hu Gutian agreed. But when it was time to leave the office, Mr. Hu Gutian suddenly became confused and forgot that lovely date. Even more unfortunately, that young lady discovered that Mr. Hu Gutian was having tea with another girlfriend somewhere, on that Saturday. Things ended like that, although our Mr. Hu wrote a very long letter to explain to her, the result was that Mr. Hu Gutian lost his love.</p>
<p>Among a group of young colleagues, love affairs are naturally the best topic of conversation. From that time on, Mr. Hu Gutian was called Confused.</p>
<p>Now let's call him Mr. Confused. After this incident, Mr. Confused naturally looked a little depressed. His best friend and colleague Zhu, probably influenced by those chapters and novels, secretly and generously took on the responsibility of restoring Mr. Confused's love with that young lady. He wanted to complete a sensational story of a chivalrous hero. He boasted to people that he was Guan Shoufeng in "The Tides of Laughter and Tears."</p>
<p>The office naturally became lively. Mr. Confused's story was like a modern drama, and the colleagues compiled a script of "Two Beauties Fighting for a Husband", which was performed by several of the most active colleagues in the telephone room. During the break after meals, a wooden sign was written with words such as "This group specially invites Mr. Confused to rehearse Two Beauties Fighting for a Husband" as an advertisement.</p>
<p>Because of this unreserved commotion, Mr. Confused often seemed uneasy and restless. During the break, he dared not stay in the office. He walked alone on the road, or sat in a daze in the Bund Park. The chivalrous hero Guan Shoufeng felt that the time for him to act as a chivalrous hero had matured. He followed Mr. Confused. He sympathized with Mr. Confused's situation. He indignantly scolded the colleagues for their unrighteousness and shamelessness. He also encouraged Mr. Confused that he should bravely move forward on the road of love, and he should use the spirit of patriotism to chop down the thorns that prevent him from advancing. The victory gained through such bravery is the true victory! Therefore, colleague Zhu found out that the person who had tea with Mr. Confused that day was Mr. Confused's aunt. So the chivalrous hero Guan Shoufeng became proud in the writing room. To complete this sensational story, the last step was to visit Mr. Confused's girlfriend. In his expectation, this was also the easiest to solve.</p>
<p>But before Guan Shoufeng had finished his great achievement, Mr. Confused and that girlfriend had already reconciled. That news was again eavesdropped by the naughty colleagues in the telephone room.</p>
<p>The situation in the writing room of course changed again. Those clowns could no longer muster the energy to rehearse the comedy of "Two Beauties Fighting for a Husband". On the contrary, they felt sorry for Mr. Confused. Colleague Zhu also felt ashamed. He spent his energy and time, but the final great achievement was destroyed by Mr. Confused.</p>
<p>The writing room temporarily calmed down, waiting, for someone to come and perform a good show again.</p>
<p>I suddenly thought of a couplet on a temporary stage, "The world is a big theater, the theater is a small world." Every corner of this world is an independent small theater. Mr. Confused's love affair originally had nothing to do with a third party, but humans seem to be destined to perform a play from birth, so there are clowns to rehearse "Two Beauties Fighting for a Husband", and then there is colleague Zhu's Guan Shoufeng to come out to act as a chivalrous hero, and Mr. Confused is also forced to take on the role of the righteous young man in this play.</p>
<p>I remember someone saying: "The actors are fools, and the audience are idiots." In the "world is a big theater," I am afraid that there are only these two kinds of human beings.</p>

<h3>"Long Pavilion Willow" Lyrics</h3>
<p>Where do the flying catkins and falling flowers go? Layers of ice and snow hasten the decay. A sparse tree stands lonely in the fifth watch of the night. Cherishing its good moonlight, even in its withered state, they are still connected. Most of all, after the dense silk falls, it reminds people of the spring mountains. It's difficult to wash skirts, even when the farmers continue to work. How much hatred does the west wind carry? It cannot blow away the scattered worries.</p>
<p>Bringing a bit of the previous night's snow, the frozen snow hangs heavy on the tree. Looking back at the east wind, one cannot bear the grief. The leaves are dry, the silk is not exhausted, not dead, only frowning. Can you recall outside the red mud pavilion, whose slender waist danced until tired? Now, lonely, waiting for someone to return. Next year, it will still be green. Do you know if it will tie up the dappled horse?</p>
<p>Hou Jiuxia's "Double Pearl Phoenix"</p>
<p>Li Shude (940) 3:30 PM to 4:15 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Zijuan Lies and Deceives Baoyu"</p>
<p>Amiable Baoyu is bored. He visits Lin Gu to dispel his depression. Arriving at Xiaoxiang, it is truly lonely. That Zijuan, sitting alone in front of the corridor, is very charming. He hastily asks about the lady's illness. Zijuan says, "The cough has slightly subsided, don't worry about it." Baoyu, with both hands, strokes her chest, saying, "Your clothes are thin, inviting illness." Zijuan, gritting her teeth, hates in her heart, scolding, "Don't act recklessly in my presence again. Gossip is terrible, people will say you are frivolous. The lady will avoid you if she sees you." After speaking, she runs into the inner chamber. Today, the young master is humiliated, his heart is as cold as ice water. Leaving the hall door, his soul is lost. Sitting on the artificial rock, tears fall like rain. A bookworm with a single-minded love, his thoughts surge like an angry tide. He can't eat lunch, his anger is hard to dissipate. Xueyan, puzzled by the Second Master's banishment, comes to ask Zijuan to go over. Walking to the rock, she opens her mouth and says, "Why is the Second Master sitting blankly and wailing?" He says, "You are all estranged from me, my heart is twisted with bitter anguish." Zijuan says, "The lady will return to her hometown next year, and we will be separated by distant roads." Baoyu says, "Sister, why do you tell so many lies? My sister has very few relatives at home." Zijuan says, "Although the Jia family is of high status, the Lin family has always been noble. One day, the lady will marry. Next year, her family will definitely send someone to invite her. Your sister told me herself that your mutual affection is all in vain." That Baoyu, as if struck by lightning from a clear sky, pierced by ten thousand arrows, barely able to endure. Returning to Yi Hongyuan, he suffers a serious illness.</p>

<p>The warm sun moves, and a hundred flowers are fresh. Wine shop flags are displayed before the village apricot trees. Du Fu enjoys the spring with peach and plum blossoms in full bloom, composing poems and drinking wine, truly worthy of being called a celestial being. Mengmei breaks a willow branch, passing on a beautiful story. In the Peony Pavilion, they meet Chan Juan. The pomegranate flower protects Zhong Jinshi. The Dragon Boat Race competes during the Dragon Boat Festival. Fan Li once presented the beauty Xi Shi to the King of Wu. Xi Shi and the King of Wu pick lotus together. The Weaver Girl and Cowherd meet on the seventh night of the seventh month. Balsam flowers face each other by the magpie bridge. Sweet osmanthus fragrance pleases everyone. Chang'e in the moon loves the young. Tao Qian loves chrysanthemums by the fence with a public heart, climbing high on the ninth day of the ninth month, his heart fluttering. Consort Yang is drunk on the agarwood couch, ashamed of the hibiscus's color. Snowflakes pile up on the Blue Pass Road. Once passed by Duke Wen's horse. Don't say that there are no ancient festivals in the depths of winter. There is also Meng Haoran who searches for plum blossoms in the snow. This is truly, each month has its own beautiful flowers.</p>

<h3>Traitors Commit All Kinds of Evil</h3>
<p>Although there are many reasons for our country's national crisis, the evil deeds of traitors are also a major cause. Therefore, traitors are great criminals who harm the country!</p>
<p>In Tianyi's new film "Mr. Wang's Way to Make a Fortune," director Zuo Ming uses many humorous techniques to expose the life of a traitor. He smuggles to amass wealth, extorts at high interest rates, oppresses small citizens, teases female waitresses, plays with guides, deceives, swindles, knocks, and cheats, simply committing all kinds of evil. This allows the audience to have a "hatred of evil diseases" in their hearts, which, in terms of national defense significance, can undoubtedly receive a very high evaluation.</p>
<h3>"Mysterious Flower" is Being Filmed</h3>
<p>The play "Mysterious Flower," written by Yi Hua's Pan Zienong, is about a lively and beautiful girl who is controlled by a group of scoundrels in society. They use her as a cash cow to bewilder wealthy merchants, officials, and journalists, creating a series of sensational and shocking events. This girl is the "Mysterious Flower" in the play.</p>
<p>"Mysterious Flower" is directed by Yue Feng, and filming has been underway for several days. The male and female leads, Bai Yang and Wang Naidong, Ma Loufen, Qin Tong, Jiang Xiu, etc., were very excited on the first day of filming.</p>
<p>The mysterious girl Yan Ziwei in "Mysterious Flower" is played by Bai Yang. This role is very suitable for her personality. Bai Yang has already had good achievements on the screen in the past, and her performance in this play will surely be even more remarkable.</p>
<p>In "Mysterious Flower," Wang Naidong plays the leader of a gang of bad guys, a very demanding role. Ma Loufen plays a journalist, Qin Tong plays a wealthy merchant, Jiang Xiu plays a military governor, Guan Hongda plays a young master, and Liang Dusheng plays an assistant who takes apart white helpers. They all have intense scenes.</p>
<h3>"A Match Made in Heaven" Premieres at New Light Tonight at 9:15</h3>
<h3>Glimpses of the Floral Extravaganza</h3>
<p>Mr. Baekman, the leader of the Baekman Floral Extravaganza, is a veteran in the song and dance troupe. Years ago, he came to Shanghai with Haijingbo to perform amazing feats of strength, which people in Shanghai should still remember. This time, he is revisiting the East, bringing eighty performers, including forty beauties, to offer the latest and most innovative programs.</p>
<p>Most of the troupe members are Hollywood movie stars. For example, Natto is a famous New York song and dance star who has appeared in MGM films several times; Ellen is an actress from RKO Pictures; Arienne is a costume expert, and most of the costumes for the Ziegfeld Follies were designed by her; and Wilson is a music and singing expert who was one of the important actors in Chevalier's The Smiling Lieutenant and has recently been performing continuously for twenty-two weeks at the famous American dance hall Gil Tack Tack.</p>
<p>The forty beautiful troupe members were selected from Hollywood. Each of them is as beautiful as a flower, as light as a swallow, with balanced muscles and a wealth of curves. Each person is capable of performing independently, and there is absolutely no one who is just filling in the numbers, which is especially rare.</p>
<p>The troupe will perform at the Carlton Theatre starting tomorrow, with two shows each day, a matinee at 5:30 PM and an evening show at 9:15 PM. To reserve seats by phone, call 355536.</p>
<h3>The Common People's "Pawning Life"</h3>
<p>Art is for the masses, and art should depict the lives of the masses. Tianyi's new film "Wealth and Glory" contains many depictions of the painful lives of the masses.</p>
<p>In the era of economic depression, ordinary people are constantly forced to live a pawning life. The comedians Ge Furong and Weng Shirong in "Wealth and Glory" are living a pawning life. They have to pawn their clothes, their broken umbrellas, their galoshes, and their bedding. If there is nothing else to pawn, they even pawn a broken mirror, deeply portraying the painful lives of the poor.</p>
<h3>Has Not Abandoned "Black Hell"</h3>
<p>To the editor: The other day (the 22nd), your column "News from the Drama Front" contained news about drama troupes. The first paragraph was about our troupe, and there are very inconsistent errors in the facts. Mr. Ling He, the original author of the play "Black Hell" that our troupe is rehearsing, has not said that he disagrees, and he has not abandoned the play. It is because the Social Bureau has not officially approved the review and also for the sake of careful consideration of the technical perfection of the play that we are making it a second performance. We are now changing the first performance to Mr. Cao Yu's "Sunrise." Please correct this, and I wish you well. From the 1937 Drama Society.</p>

<h3>New Techniques for Driving in Fog</h3>
<p>— For</p>
<p>The biggest threat to car driving every year is fog. This is not because the fog itself is so bad, nor is it because the designers of car lights have made any mistakes, but because drivers use their cars in various weather conditions every day.</p>
<p>In fact, fog can completely halt all traffic. Only vehicles that rely on tracks can safely move forward. Only in this kind of foggy weather can car drivers understand the value of tracks. They can use these tracks as their guides. If they are timid, they can follow behind a tram until their destination.</p>
<p>Driving home on a familiar road, remembering the landmarks along the way, can also help in times of panic. Ordinary shops and houses may be completely invisible at that time. Remembering the changes in the road surface, such as the slope and curves of the road, can also be of some help. However, the curves of the road are not always reliable, because the speed of driving in fog is relatively slow, and sometimes you may not realize that you have turned a corner. A high-density fog not only makes things a few yards away completely invisible, but also shrouds the sounds emitted. Therefore, the danger of driving is of course greatly increased.</p>
<p>Some drivers cannot even find their route in relatively light fog. This is partly due to their lack of confidence and partly due to the use of unsuitable car lights. Regarding this matter, we only want to say one sentence: If you feel any danger, leave your car at the first car shop you pass and walk home, or if there is public transportation, take public transportation home.</p>
<p>Headlights are not very useful in fog. Reduce the ordinary light and only use side lights and special fog lights. These two types of lights each have their own advantages, so some people advocate using one of them, while others advocate using the other. Neither is completely correct. Whichever type of light is used, the light must shine downwards and have absolutely no upward glare. Upward glare will blur our vision and reflect the water droplets suspended in the fog. This is why headlights are useless. If the side lights are too strong, they will also produce the same adverse effect mentioned above. If the light is completely downward, then we can identify the things in front of us in this pool of light.</p>
<p>It is best to install two fog lights. One is installed on the side near the curb, with the light shining towards the curb, only a few feet from the front of the car. The other is installed in the center or on the side near the center of the road, with the light shining forward. The lower these two lights are installed, the better. If they cannot be installed below the bumper, then install them above it. The front window must be open, even though we feel uncomfortable, because with the window open, our vision can increase by a few feet. The fog seems to stop outside the window, becoming a hazy barrier.</p>
<h3>Safety Equipment of 1937 Model New Cars (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yunling</p>
<p>Based on this, the safety of the 1937 model new cars is indeed far superior to the past. The automobile manufacturing engineers can be said to have exhausted their brains to seek benefits for passengers, and they can be said to be loyal and thorough. However, everything is in the process of progress. What is now regarded as perfect may be despised in the future. What has not been realized today may be supplemented in the future. Therefore, the progress of automobile safety is also endless. Researchers in this field are buried in hard work every day. The cars we see today, sedan cars are indeed tightly sealed, but the whole body is streamlined. The ventilation method does not even use "ventilation." The center of gravity of the body has been lowered, and the suspension of the springs has been greatly improved. The vibration of the cars seems to have been swept away. All these things make it impossible for those who touch or hear their voices to explore the speed of the car. This progress is undeniable. The comfort of riding can reduce the fatigue of passengers. This statement is very accurate. However, there are also some people who think that this will make it impossible for passengers to experience the danger even when driving at breakneck speed or recklessly. Although this is an exaggeration, the stable and comfortable driving of the new cars can be known.</p>
<p>In the future, the safety equipment of automobiles will be more comprehensive, as can be estimated from what we see before us. Let's take one example to illustrate the rest. In the 1927 model new cars, all the sharp and protruding parts inside the car are polished or changed to rounded shapes. The instrument panel and door knob handles are as smooth as possible. The door keys and small objects are mostly hidden in the wall panels, so that in the event of sudden braking or collision while the car is moving, the people in the car will not suffer a major disaster due to hitting sharp objects. If automobile manufacturing progresses further in the future, it will inevitably eliminate all sharp and protruding objects inside and outside the car and add soft covers such as pads to the instrument panel to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Brakes and tires have the wonderful effect of complementing each other in terms of safety. Today's non-slip tires and powerful brakes can be said to have reached their peak in manufacturing. Brakes and tires can now stop immediately on a line, which is of great benefit. What cannot be avoided is that when the car stops suddenly and sharply, it is difficult to guarantee that the passengers in the car will not be shocked. Therefore, there is a mechanical braking method, which can almost avoid this drawback. The principle of this method is to use the brakes based on the distance and the amount of pressure, without having to use a lot of force to apply the brakes to achieve the effect. This new type of device has been quite useful in buses and private cars. In addition, there are sand spreaders to prevent slippage, and slings used on airplanes have also been used in cars, which can all increase the efficiency of safe riding. The effectiveness of the polarized light system will also be completed soon. It is likely that all cars will adopt it in the near future.</p>
<p>The mudguards at the front of the car are currently made of steel. In the future, for the sake of greater safety, they may be replaced with rubber, which can reduce the risk of accidents. In addition, the car will be surrounded by ribbed strips to protect it from collisions. The greatest innovation of automobiles in the future that we can anticipate is the movement of the engine to the rear of the car and the placement of the driver's seat at the very front of the car. Many engineers say that this modification is not only a natural trend in manufacturing, but it is also sufficient to guarantee safety. Because currently, the driver is often five or six feet away from the very front of the car. Even if the car is driving extremely fast, they often do not realize how dangerous it is. If they can drive at the very front of the car, then the scenery on the road will be clearly visible, and they will naturally not want to try excessive speeds with their lives. In short, the safety equipment of automobiles is endless and will improve with each passing day, so that passengers can all be very satisfied.</p>
<h3>New Oldsmobile</h3>
<p>The left is a 1937 model new Oldsmobile currently on display at United Motors Company.</p>
<h3>New Renault Car</h3>
<p>The French Renault small car is one of the most outstanding small cars of 1937. The car body is petite and exquisite, the mechanics are sturdy and durable, the seats are comfortable and spacious, and the decoration is luxurious and magnificent. As for the high speed, fuel economy, and the greatness of its effectiveness and the completeness of its equipment, it is also something that the factory's past products have not achieved. The factory has produced many new types of small cars this year, and the "Serde" small car is the most worthy of praise. The new car has already arrived in Shanghai and is on display at the showroom of the local dealer, Fada Automobile Company, No. 424 Xiafei Road, starting today. The public is welcome to test drive. The attached picture is the majestic appearance of the new Renault.</p>
