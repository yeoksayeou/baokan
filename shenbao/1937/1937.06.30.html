<h3>不容忽視之防水工作</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>連日風雨交侵。各地均告水患。魯境黃河。大溜頂衝。李升屯壩。竟遭坍塌。武漢江水。汜濫狂漲。亦已突破前年紀錄。而永定河之溜勢洶涌。南渾河之接漲不巴。並使人有談虎色變之恫。他如贛之贛江。閩之閩江。浙之錢塘蘭江。粵之東韓兩江。或僅沒溢江岸。或遂冲破堤圩。此呼彼嘯。若為倡和。乘時肆虐。貽害生靈。路軌被毀。交通阻斷。災象所早。已堪憫惻。而閩垣於兩旬之間。亦遭水厄。民居蕩析。炊食無由。槥木浮屍。隨地漂流。厥狀凄切。尤難勝述。方今時節猶在黃梅。大小水患已相凌逼。轉瞬大汛開始。形勢必更猖狂。不於今茲先事籌維。何以策來日之安寗。吾人所不辭以老生之當談。聒時賢之耳鼓者。亦聊欲盡其提撕之責任而已。</p>
<p>洪水之在吾國久為民生大敵要在𣿼導之得宜差能倖免於一時民二十年之嚴重災情。迄今猶貯蘊於吾人之心頭。前歲慘刻印象。陳跡更屬鮮明。瘡演未復。隱痛方深。前事不忘。後車知戒。則於目前新厄之來臨。寗有不思防止之對策者。祇以常人習於因循。憚為更張。官事祇求迂𢌞。莫辨緩急。故往往發言盈庭。而折衷無從。文書投遞。而實效不章。此在平日晏安之秋。不妨從容斟酌情實若論巨浸盪决之頃寗客遷延以誤事機故今日之言防水必須異方一心。交鞭互策。以切膚之同情。思賑救之自我。以萬釣之力量。弭猝發之危機。人人振刷泄沓之精神。事事講求迅捷之應付。則滔滔者縱屬極難控制。及今猶得防患於未然證諸去年秋汛得以安然渡過。固由天災不為已其亦未嘗非人事方面努力之結果。今年承昨歲小康之餘。誠恐當事狃於近績。遽忘襄失。懲毖之圖。有所未盡故特為提出藉資省察深願責任方面。對於本屆防水工作能以更精密之打算。更底厲之心力。以統籌辦理也。</p>

<h3>日本第一財閥三井的政治經濟勢力（三）</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>（五）池田成彬在政治上的領導力</p>
<p>誰替三井計劃，由法西斯的威脅下，轉向到領導法西斯呢？這就是池田成彬。</p>
<p>池田成彬是三井家的“掌櫃”，為三井服務已經四十多年，三井家非常相信他。最近二十多年來，三井資本完全在他的指導下，所以，事實上他也是日本資本主義的指導者。</p>
<p>三井家信賴由外面雇來的“掌櫃”，并不自池田成彬始，這是很有歷史的根據的。三井家的家憲上，從來就這樣寫着：“商業的要訣，在能錄用適當之人才，必淘汰老朽引用新進”。道家憲的制定，遠在明治維新前，三井家創業者的眼光。確是很可驚異的。</p>
<p>三井發展的每一階段，都是由於謀臣的策劃。第一期帮助明治維新，脫離封建的幕府的壓迫，這事業是由當時三井的“掌櫃”三野村一手完成的。在戰爭時，三井家固然受了不小的犧牲，但戰爭後，三井却從政府方面得到很多的利益了。這是三井王国顺利發展的第一個基礎。</p>
<p>第二期指導三井由商業資本迅速走向工業資本的，又是三井的“掌櫃”中上川和益田孝二人。繼中上川和益田孝之後的，就是今日的池田成彬了。</p>
<p>當宇垣內閣流產，林內閣成立時，誰也知道林內閣是強力內閣，法西斯色彩更濃厚了。但林內閣的藏相結城豊太郎，却與三井謀將池田成彬携手（池田就任日本銀行總栽）了。池田成彬不是忠忠實實代表着三井的利益的嗎？由這合作，日本法西斯的前途是可想見的了——這便是，脫下反財閥的擬裝，帮助金融資本統制的強化。</p>
<p>現在，在日本反財閥的人們中，暗地裏獻媚財閥的已是不少了。這是財閥工作的進展，也便是則閥的指導者池田成彬的偉業。池田成彬這種人物，正是效忠財閥，推動日本資本主義機構的最高按師。</p>
<p>“二•二八”事變後，池田一面利用國本社（日本法西期團體，會員多為軍人，“二•二六”事變後被解散。）的關係，聯絲軍部的上層部。一面建方三井，表示轉向，向社會及少壯軍人送秋波。同時又利用大阪政治經濟研究會，盡量支持旣成政黨。於是從去年秋末始，政黨便開始活躍了。馬場財政只為了偏重軍部所提倡的廣義國防，稍稍顧到農村，於是就不能不在資本家的反抗下，宜佈倒台了。</p>
<p>結城財政的成功，是在犧牲農村，這是誰都承認的。農村利益被漢視，“廣義國防”的意義何在呢？然而，現在軍部中已經有如下的論調了：</p>
<p>“為了要完成國防計畫，必須避免和財界的摩擦。在目前，擴充生產力比甚麼都必要，國防政策只有和金融資本，軍需工業資本調和才有出路。”</p>
<p>軍部已從廣義國防退到狹義國防了，强化“滿洲國”，是目前日本“軍”，“財”兩界一致的呼聲，“打倒財閥”，“復興農村”的口號，已被收藏到歷史的文庫裏。發動”二•二六”事變的法西斯英雄，或死，或監禁，或被“肅”出現役軍人外。像板垣一流的急進派，現在也都出不了頭。出頭指導政冶的，是池田成彬——三井財閥的代言人。日本法西斯是正在變質哩！牠將由“反財閥變為“親財閥”了。</p>
<p>其實，這才是日本法西斯的進展，而且，這也才是法西斯存在的根本意義。</p>
<p>最近，三井出資三千萬元開辦飛機製造廠了。不到這個現存社會機構根本破壞時，財閥是總有辦法的。池田此次就任日本銀行總裁，是日本金融資本發展的又一新階段。至於日本社會及國際情勢，將因此受到甚密影響，那是非本文所能及了。</p>

<h3>國防錢上（十五）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>（丙）內容——內容實在太龐大太詳盡了。這裏，衹述牠的大概。除去司法獨立，這裏面浚有列入外，其餘一切方面的措施，總包括列舉在內。主要對象，為政治與經濟兩方面。政治部份，大概包括有：整飭吏治，整頓警衛，聲理土地，調查戶口，改止禮俗，舉辦救濟事業，改進衛生，革新村政，促成地方自治，整理田賦，整理舊稅，推行親稅，整頓財務行政，發展金融事業，整頓學校，推廣社會敎育，等等。經濟部份包括五項：農業，工業，商業，礦業，及交通。屬於農業的，如水利，植棉，林墾，牧畜，以及其他農事之推行機關，輔導設施，像合作事業，試騐場，等等，皆有規定。屬於工業部份的，共分為機械工業，染織工業，電氣工業，化學工業，等等。屬於商業部份的，有整理金融，獎勵輸出，减少輸入，公營商業，商業調查與指導，人村培養與任用，等等。屬於礦業部份的，有開發未辦礦業，整理已開礦業，設置礦業機關，籌措辦礦資本，等等。屬於交通部份的，有：鐵路計劃，公路計劃，水運計劃，電話計劃，郵政電報計劃，等等。計劃案的目次，可以分成下列各點：㊀要旨。㊁共列三篇：第一篇總則，內有六款。第二篇省建設之部，第三篇縣村建設之部。第二篇又分為四章：（甲）政治方面。中有二節：第一節，改善現行政治。分列“必成”和“期成”等事項•第二節，完成地方自治，又分為八款。（乙）經濟方面，中有三節：㊀增加人民生產，內分三款。㊁發展公營事業，內分”款。㊂省，縣，村經濟統制之設施，內分二款。（丙）省政建設研究院，分為四節。（丁）附則，又分為四款。第三篇為縣村建設之部。（規定縣村施政計劃，應由縣村自打編定。）最後為附錄，共二款。</p>
<p>這就是聞名一時的“山西省政十年建設計劃”的內容大概。不過除此以外，山西當局們，曾經特別聲明過：“本計劃所列舉政治經濟各事項，不過就目前計劃所及，而大致能以確定者言之；其有本計劃未經列入，而在十年內所應隨時舉辦者，自應舉辦，非謂本案不列之事，即行政偏發之事。”所以，牠的內容，仍然可以隨環境需要隨時添加的。這樣大規模的計劃，看一看牠的實質和用意，說牠是總動員的變態，我想，是沒有什麼不可以的。</p>
<p>（丁）期限和步驟——為什麼恰恰定為“十年”呢？這一點，據山西的當局們解釋起來，是有著國內環境和國外環境兩方面原因的。國內方面，他們以為，我們一切政治社會情形，總沒有上軌道，所以一開首的時候，先要有三五年的工夫，用在掃除建設障碍上，以作實行建設的準備。中國要自強，非如此不可；山西也當然不能例外。國外環境呢，據山西當局的當時估計，十年之內，列強各國的一切海陸空軍準備完成，那時候，東亞問題，也就要實行總解决。所以在這“十年以內，中國非有辦法不可，再遲恐趕不及。”同時，他們也聲明著：雖然定為十年，如果能不到十年就完成，那當然更好。</p>
<p>實行這個計劃的步驟一層，據山西當局們的意見，以為可分成兩方面：前三年，以政治作中心，注重掃除建設障碍，確立民主政治的基礎；後七年以經濟作中心，為完成自足的目標。然而，步驟的劃分，不過依其著重點而言，並非前三年全係政治建設，而無經濟建設；或後七年祇有經濟建設，而無政治建設的意思。</p>
<p>這個計劃，是二十一年年底確定的，到現在，已經四五年了。如果照山西當局當初的計算，那末，應當正是在踏進第二步的時候了。</p>
<p>（戊）最後的目的—這個“十年計劃”的最後目的，到底怎樣，這，我們由他們產生這個計劃的動機裏，已經可以推導出來了。在這裏，我想再把山西當局們希望的具體目的述一述。據他們的解說，實行這個計劃以後他們所希望的，就是：在政治方面，山西要達到澈底的民主；在經濟方面，要達到山西“社會經濟入款多出款少的實况。”這樣一來，國防才有保護和基礎•同時，對於所謂“社會經濟”增加的一點，他們更有進一步的解釋，就是：“至少限度，可以達到每人每年平均增加二十元生產價額。”</p>
<p>主持這個計劃最高當局的閻晨川先生曾說過：“方法祇要在合理的範圍內，隨時可以變更；目的無論如何，不能動搖。”</p>
<p>（己）實行的方法和决心—以一省的政治力量，去實行這樣一個龐大而繁重的計劃，山西的當局們也很知道，實在是“在中國政治史上，可以說是個創舉。”其意義，就是不啻把“積弊相沿的政府，變成一個造產政府。”他們也預料到前途的困難重重，所以，在具體方法上，他們打算適應環境，隨時變更。而且，打算先設研究院，劃陽曲，太原，榆次，等三縣，為試騐區，希望由實踐裏得到理論，由經騐裏得到方法。而暫時推行的方法，就是：㊀山山西當局，實施考績辦法，以政治力量，督促人民造產。㊁各廳，處，局，所，及縣政府，都要本著計劃方案，分途魚督促指導的責任。㊂設立實•行計劃方案的專責機關，去努力推行，㊃希望“無論機關，團體，個人，凡是有一分的責任，即應盡一分的力量，萬不要推諉，理不可敷衍。”</p>
<p>我們檢查一下山西當局所用的，推行的方法，總覺得有點渺茫，和不很有把握。然而，這個缺點，是可以由山西當局的决心來補救一部份的。</p>
<p>他們很清楚地確認：竭力推行這個計劃，一定是很艱難的工作。可是，他們以為國家已經到了這步田地，不幸亡了，痛苦之大，是不待說的：但要想強圖，也並非從舒服裏，就可以得來。閻百川先生曾有過這樣的警句：“假使把這羣官吏（意指中國舊式官史。）集合起來，說明强國必需的要求，而任人表决，他們固然不敢贊成亡國，可是贊成強國的手，恐怕他們也不敢痛快舉起來。”所以，他們主張，為了實行這個“自强”的計劃，無論官吏人民，非抱定犧牲决心，忍受絕大痛苦，咬住牙關，經過幾十年努力不可的。因而，他們又主張，在這推行建設期間，對官吏，定“遺誤罪，”對人民，定“妨害罪”。凡是不能奉行這計劃的官民，一律照這兩種罪去處罰。縱使因此釀成“造產恐怖時代”，但因為國難臨頭的緣故，那是沒有辦法的，而且為消除國難起見，也是值得的。</p>
<p>閻百川先生曾表示過：“計劃實行，是要全省人民負責，非我一人說實行，就能實行。不過我此次，實在有實行的决心。我是排除萬難和一切顧慮，願督促全省民衆，去做這件事。僅僅山西一省，建設成功，雖然說不到是國家整個的強盛，但一省如能走上新的政治道路，國家自然也就有了一部份的希望。”這種表示，由記者看來，可以說是恰恰足以代表山西當局們全體的决心和抱負。</p>

<h3>雲南烟禁實况</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>雲南大時气候、素稱美善、故物產極為豐富、據建設廳長张邦翰談述各種物產質量、略紀如下、</p>
<p>雲南五金鑛產、藏量最富、其中以煤鐵為尤豐、全省一百三十縣局、幾乎沒處不產煤鐵、在邊遠的地方、更特別的多、鐵鑛間或有人開採、煤則因林原廣漢、燒用不盡、縱煤層天然暴露出來、也很少有人加以垂靑、他如箇舊之錫、會澤巧家之銅、魯甸雙柏之銀、文山平彝之銻、蒙化•鳳儀•之砒、都已開採見效、至於硫磺•鎳•金•鉛•鋅•鈷•（金屬化學原質之一、堅如鎳、色靑自而微紅、價極貴、故工業上很少用牠、惟有養化物製成的鉛末、色彩鮮艷、多用作顏料、）等鑛、產地亦很多、各鑛產量、除筒舊錫因有悠久的稅收歷史、得知年產六七千噸以外、其他多係士法開採、規模簡陋、且採輟無常、尚無調查藪字、還有大理石•水晶石•右棉•石膏•磁土•明𥖥•滑石•天然鹼•顏料石等、也是產額無定、</p>
<p>雲南的天然林原、廣袤在一千萬畝以上、所產松•杉•柏•栗•等木材、科益無窮、關於食用•藥用•工業用•之林產物、也是非常豐美、如茶葉•紫梗•樟腦•烏柏•漆樹•油桐•棉花•板栗•松子•核桃•銀杏•龍眼•荔枝•木耳•香菌•竹筍•竹參•茯苓•虫草•有色木棉（產墨江縣壩榴村、計有紅藍黑三種、鮮艷甚於市上所賣之棉綫、惟僅寥寥數株、現正設法多種、）三七•（多年生草、外敷可止血消腫、內服係溫補劑、）雞葶菌•（係滇省特產食物、鮮美勝於‘味精、’從前明熹宗最好吃此物、專設驛站採買至京、產地僅蒙化•崇明•等寥寥數縣、）虎掌菌•（價尚較雞葶菌為貴、滇省上等酒席用、）以及肉桂等數十種特產藥材、每年產量銷數、都大有可觀、</p>
<p>本省農民、往昔栽植鴉片殊多、現已决計於本年內完全禁種、縱有礙於省府稅收、亦所不惜、省府此項收入、每年合國幣一百餘萬元、籌補方法、已有相當把握、惟民間經濟損失、很成問題、因為全省產烟年達四千餘萬兩、除本省消耗其半以外、其餘二千餘萬兩、都運銷他處、至少可換回國幣二千餘萬元、今旣毅然禁絕、此項經濟上的損失、自應另籌抵補方法也、蓋鴉片關係於雲南出入口貨物價值、頗為重大、綠雲南歷年大宗入口貨、棉鈔布匹、約值國幣二千餘萬元、綢緞絲綿藥材化裝品及其他雜件等、約值一千餘萬元、共計三千餘萬元至四千萬元、至於出口貨、大錫值一千七百餘萬元至二千二百萬元、山貨藥材約值四五百萬元、共計二千三四百萬元、在以前禁種鴉片時、每年人超一千餘萬元至二千萬元、自鴉片復種後、此項入超鉅數、不惟可以相抵、有時還貌似出超、另（據雲南經濟委員會發表、雲南前入超每年約在二百餘萬兩、自民二十年變為出超、直至二十四年、竟達國𢁙一千一百餘萬元、）所以當日步步趨跌的舊滇票、因得滋潤之力、而可維持相當平穩的地位、鴉片與雲南經濟金融關係之深、可見一斑故此次禁烟抵補辦法、應先使出入口貨價、在相當期間、務求平衡、但目前出口貨中、如山貨藥材、則外銷不暢、幸大錫能盡量輸出、應速設法增加其產量、他如鎢•銻•石棉•雲母片石等、亦要積極從事開採、以應市銷、</p>
<p>省府主席龍雲、對於禁種鴉片問題、亦貧有所表示據云、“禁烟以後、收入銳誡、於萬分困難中、已籌有抵補辦法、種烟的山地原田、大都可以改種冬季作物、至於其他適宜植物、尤以桐棉二項為首要、桐油是本省重要出口貨、已就適宜植桐的元謀等五十七縣、劃成植桐區、各縣已於去秋各購種籽五百斤去播種、推廣植棉一項、曾向全國經濟委員會、買來種籽三萬斤、分發官棉各地、從事種植實騐、此外在昆明市南門外、還開辦機器紡紗織布廠將以本省所種的綿花為原料、”關於全省禁烟狀况、自省府决定“三年禁絕”致策後、並於二十四年起、嚴行實施、禁種方面、已有八十五市縣全絕毒萌、其餘正嚴厲施禁的四十四縣、亦决於本年內按限全數掃清、禁吸方面、計全省登記烟民、達十七萬六干一百十二人、目下在昆明市戒烟聲院戒烟的烟民、為數頗多、</p>

<p>日本駐華大使川越茂、啣其外省新訓令、來華返任、業於昨日下午四時、乘日郵淺問丸抵滬同行僅秘書星田、眷屬並未偕來、輪泊楊樹沛匯山碼頭、當時日海軍陸戰隊、及租界巡捕房探捕、均嚴施戒備赴輪次歡迎者、計有我國駐日大使許世英、本市代理市長俞鴻鈞代表王長春、外交部駐滬辦事處主任周玨、外部條約委員王芃生、駐日使館祕書黃伯度、胡邁及來滬迎晤之該國外務省東亞局第一課長上村、日使館參事官兼駐京總領事日高、參專官兼駐滬總領事岡本、華文參贊清水、情報部長兼駐滬領事出民、領事吉州岡、書記官曾彌、陸軍武官喜多、陸軍輔佐武官宇都宮、海軍武官本田海軍輔佐武官冲野、日僑居留民團長甘濃、各路聯合會會長林雄吉、日僑領袖船津•卜部•山本•等百餘人、川越在輪次與各歡迎人員寒暄畢、即宣稱因輪行勞頓、身體不適、登岸驅東逕返其畢助路官邸、我國記者團晤之於輪次、固請談話卒被拒絕、當晚七時、駐滬總領岡本、在西摩路官邸、歡宴川越、為之洗慶所有上村•日高•田尻•清水等均邀參加、即席舉行會議、川越說明回國請訓經過及新訓令內容、日高•岡本•報告我國一般情形、上村•田尻•報告此次赴華北視察經過、川越續並召集陸軍武官喜多、海軍武官平田、洽談一切、直至夜深始散、據新聲社記者探悉、川越已與許世英氏約明、定今日下午三時、往訪許氏許氏昨曾向新聲社記者表示、與川越之會晤、不過作私人談話、非外交談判性質、先是許氏昨迎略川越於輪次時、川越首代表其新首相近衛、向許氏問好、謂日本朝野、均盼許大使能早日回任云、又據日使館華文參贊清水告新聲社記者、川越抵滬、約勾留數日後晉京、惟聞王外長已定下月二日赴廬、故恐不及會晤、何時赴華北及廬山、現尚未定、日使館因貴國行政院各部、暑期均移廬辦公、為接洽事務便利起見、故亦在廬租屋一所、將來輪流派員前往、但並非使館正式分館性質耳云、</p>
<p>中央社云、據時局觀察者談、川越大使此次返任、對於中日外交之僵局、恐未能順利展開、蓋因川越大、使此來所準備談判者、乃為貿易航空及關稅制度之所謂調整而已、對於中國因盼望解决之冀東及察北等各項問題、均為日方所不願談及者、此可於川越大使返任前、在東京對新聞記者所發表之談話、加以證明、是故希望川越大使此次返任之後、中日問題得以順利展開者、似甚微薄云云、</p>
<p>同盟社消息、川越大使之歸國約達一月、已於二十九日、午後四時承淺間丸抵滬歸任、其發表談話云、余山橫濱起航時之談話、聞中國方面已視為問題、余則認為其中不無誤會、蓋金此次歸國所痛感者即為中國以日本之發展為模範陸續進展、至近代國家、此事已成為日本知識階級之常識所謂對華再認識、亦完全普及而日本之一切亦續有進步此事應請中國各界人士、加以充分認議、至華北經濟提携、凡屬於化有益、而於日無損之各種問題、自當恊助、此為吾人之新希望、倘與地方當局商議、得以辦妥者、則與地方當局促進交涉、至須與中央交涉之際、自應與中央謀折衝、至所調政治上之國交調整、今日兩國空氣、尚難認為適當、倘兩國空氣一經良好則調整日華國交、决非不可能、余確信將來必有此種時期到來之希望、唯使兩國空氣趨於良好、當為兩國政治家之義務、因此希望兩國繼續加以努力耳、日華兩國、在發展途上、或許發生摩擦、亦意中事、但余認為日華兩國、均不欲作戰、故防患於未然、乃兩國政治家及外交官之任務也、日英會談、潮將開始、但决未達到具體的階段、對於中國問題固應包含在內、然究探若何形式、尚未决定耳、余在滬尚擬勾留兩三天、然後往南京、聞外交部長王宠惠、訂二日赴廬山恐未便相晤、但目前亦無急要、亦不必急於時談也、廬山已设有使館別墅、倘有要務、自當登山、但現在不擬往住、七月十日左右擬往華北、但並非特為促進經濟提携、至經濟提携、應由何項開始、凡此各種問題、該處人十知之甚悉、余不過與之商議而已云云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>乞賑與茶會</h3>
<p>— 王若英</p>
<p>今年的災荒，不僅是至重且慘，並且災區亦很廣闊，達八行省之多：例如山西，本年入春以來，晋南河東一帶，也迄未下雨，“存糧早已食盡，新收又極歉薄，而棉花亦迄未下種”，這樣的災况，與滴粒無收者相較起來，自然比較好一點，然而在身歷者，那又是怎樣不堪言狀的苦楚！</p>
<p>為了拯救受難的同胞，各種各式的救災運動正在開展着，那自然是好的；為了使灾胞們最低限度的活下去，所以分別其災情的輕重，以定緩急，那自然也無可非議；然而較輕災區的也該一視同人的加以賑濟，那應該也是不可或忘的。四川的災荒所以成為現在那樣慘重者，便由於輕的時候不加注意，並且還紛飾太平所形成的。何况現在晋南一帶，災况也並不輕。</p>
<p>所以晋南河東“帶之亟須賑濟，自屬毫無疑義，而推派代表向中央乞賑，向各方呼籲，更屬應當。乞賑呼籲而有結果以後呢，我以後那就應該急速回去，不但是為“處理會務”而應該急速回去，為慰災民們喁喁之望，更應該急速回去也。</p>
<p>在將回未回之前，在乞賑呼籲的時候，為災胞們請命的代表們刻苦自勵，到處節省，想來大概是一定的。但還不能無言矣，則是茶會招待是也。</p>
<p>想到災區的慘狀，我們固然不必做作得肉麻，說什麼“食不下咽”之類的話，但基於人類的同情心，當也不能無動乎中，因之，我以為，乞賑呼籲，像“邀請本市新聞界與……茶會，報告與各方接洽經過”這一類事是不必要的，理由無他，能省一分錢，卽省一分錢，能“多省一錢”，卽“多救一命”也。</p>
<p>自然，苦“報告與各方接洽經過”，是應該邀請新聞界或其他有關各界來，次會談的；報告是否是必要呢？內幕不大熟悉，一向也不曾充過代表，不知道。以字面上來看，若是祇為了報告一些經過，而並無其他作用，那麼，我以為，則是大可不必，還是早旱急速回去的好，因為會務旣亟待處理，而災胞們又不勝其翹盼也。	若是認為一定有公開報告一下“與各方接洽的經過，的必要那麼，我以為，也不必一定要“茶會”，找一個免費的地方，大家談談，不是也可，以？理由呢，還是上面說過的那些，能省一分錢卽省一分錢，“多省一錢”卽“多救一命”也。尤其是這“茶會”的召集者是替災胞們請命而來的代表，當坐在潔白的桌子之前，嗅到的是咖啡與茶點的香味，一念及災區的慘况，其也有食不終席之感乎？</p>
<p>如果說，這“茶會”的召集，原是為了“被招待者起見，那麼，這也未免太小覩了“被招待”者，因為旣為恭聆“報告”而來，對於災民自不乏極大的同情；而來者又非災民，更不會為吃幾塊蛋糕喝一杯咖啡而來也。</p>
<h3>舊式地主</h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>“不嫌髒吧，先生！在這兒你可以做你想做的事，不會有女人和小孩來吵擾你的。”</p>
<p>說這話的，是一個衣服襤褸，身材短小的老人。他，當我把來意說明，而且用最高的代價把他底房子租妥後，便帶我進一間只有一個向天魚鱗窗，暗陰的房間。這房子，雖說是在冬天，到處仍還洋溢着，一股衝鼻的霉濕氣。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>“這房子怕有幾年沒有住過人了。</p>
<p>……”我心想着，可是沒說出口。其實</p>
<p>在這時，我已很難表示對這房子的滿意</p>
<p>與不滿意問題了，外面稀落地下着雪，</p>
<p>“你做什麽?”他把我全身和背後跟</p>
<p>的獵狗，打量了一会才問道。</p>
<p>“你沒有看见：一个獵人！”我指着</p>
<p>身上的獵槍和獵狗說，於是便被接納了</p>
<p>“你在懷疑嗎？這房子是吉利的，</p>
<p>從前住過我底兒子和兒媳的。……”</p>
<p>“不！我很滿意。”我說了，便把身</p>
<p>上的東西一件件的卸下。</p>
<p>晚上，他從小店裏佔了些酒和菜餚</p>
<p>，我們便在屋子裏對坐着𢃡飲起來。這</p>
<p>個嚴峻的老頭子，喝過了幾盃後，臉就</p>
<p>紅了起來，眼睛微帶幾分醉氣。他說了</p>
<p>很多話，從季節，收成說起，又用傷感</p>
<p>的聲調說到自己：</p>
<p>“我，先生，是一個沒價值的人</p>
<p>除了想來損害我的，沒有一個對我尊敬</p>
<p>。”他悲哀的嘆息道：“農民常當面駡</p>
<p>我：桂生伯你是一個吝嗇鬼，為什麼不</p>
<p>害羞？但是我為什麼要害羞呢？我善良</p>
<p>的生活着。兒子背叛着我，三年前我替</p>
<p>他討媳婦，從那時起，他們就聯合着來</p>
<p>迫害我。當我不在家時，她們就到處搜</p>
<p>索，打破我的門銷，挖開地下的磚石，</p>
<p>為的是什麼？先生，你想一想，為的只</p>
<p>是她們相信找把錢藏在地底下。……”</p>
<p>“那麼你眞的把錢藏在地底下？”我</p>
<p>興趣地問。</p>
<p>“是的，但這關她們什麼事呢？—</p>
<p>—你這老鬼，我們沒有好食，沒有好穿</p>
<p>的，而你却把整甕銀子，藏在地底下，</p>
<p>讓它生銹發霉，她們這樣駡我，但我不</p>
<p>去理她們。我相信有一天她們會挖壞了</p>
<p>我房子裏所有地基，因此她們在時、我</p>
<p>沒敢出房門一步。夜半當她們都睡靜了</p>
<p>，我就起來動手把銀子數着，我怕她們</p>
<p>會用妖術把它騙走的。有一回我數着，</p>
<p>發現它已减少了，我相信是她們用妖術</p>
<p>騙走了，我很生氣，就把她們都從這屋</p>
<p>裏趕開。……”</p>
<p>“現在她們呢？”我好奇地呌道。</p>
<p>“在村屋靠近山的那邊，先生，明</p>
<p>天到林裏去打野兎你會看見的。”</p>
<p>“現在這大房子只你一個人住？”</p>
<p>“是的，我一個人住，這樣我就要</p>
<p>安靜多了，白天我可以數銀子，誰也不</p>
<p>會聽見。”</p>
<p>“這樣方便嗎？</p>
<p>“謝謝菩薩，什麼都很好，你看，</p>
<p>我還沒十分老呢，我還可以做點事。…</p>
<p>……”</p>
<p>飯後我退回房去。整好彈藥，準備</p>
<p>明天到林中去作整天的遊獵。</p>
<p>雪已經遍山野的在下了。在神燈前</p>
<p>有老人喃喃的禱語聲：</p>
<p>“保佑老人吧，到處都是迫害啊！</p>
<p>”</p>
<p>我惘然的在房子裏踱了起來。</p>
<h3>海程雜記（二）</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>亡國奴之羣</p>
<p>七點鐘左右，赭紅色的太陽向西天隱去，灰藍的空中，映着一片耀眼的紅光，海風凉了些，船下的水浪也變成了愛人的靑碧，浪花雪似的飛躍着，沒有鳴，也沒一顆星，天幕是昏黑的。船頭上有三個維宋人，一個四十多歲的長漢子，打船一起椗時，他就坐到鐵錨上看書，旁邊坐着一個披絨秋氅的女人，很年靑，也還有點美麗，她當看那海天連接處的遠方，有時兩人低低嘆口氣，我猜想着他們的命運，也許尼古拉皇朝時他們是將軍，或伯爵的兒女，而今流浪到東方來，把所有的家私在無盡的歲月中消耗完了，為了支撑那無法擊退的飢寒，男人作了巡捕，保鑣，或帝國主義者的間諜。女人作侍女，舞娘及賣淫婦，伴着夏天的來临，一羣出售皮肉的貴族婦女，便趕到烟台去，來接應那四海為家的西方水兵。如今平津加速的“特殊化”，一批被××浪人豢養的白俄，投到北中國來，帮助他們無恥的主子，來武裝包運走私，或作毒窩娼𪧧中的跑街。</p>
<p>另外一個矮個子，嘴永未離開過烟斗，他會講幾句不完整的中國話。</p>
<p>一直到夜深還依着船舷，面迎了海風吸烟，老是那麼憂鬰。</p>
<p>第二天下午，兩個穿蹩脚西裝的傢伙講着我一句也聽不懂的話，樣子很像中國人，話却不是任何一個省份的方言，我疑惑他們是××人，仔細聽聽，並不是講的××話，恰巧兩個女人也打後艙走來，穿着同樣的藏葛縫的朝鮮衣服，他們四個講着遠處向我們來路航去的隻船，這時一個天津口音的漢子怪聲的嚷道：</p>
<p>“××船，××船”。</p>
<p>“不是的，不是的，盛京，盛京，英國船”。</p>
<p>“外國船！比咱這個快”！</p>
<p>“盛京也是外國的，不是大日本的”</p>
<p>這天津人用高麗話問他們什麼，他們却反而用中國話回答道：</p>
<p>“長個的是朝鮮的，是朝鮮的”。</p>
<p>天津人挺認眞的說他們是朝鮮人，問他們在什麼洋行作事，他們咕嚕了幾句，大家笑笑，便各自散開了。</p>
<h3>柵欄外的黃昏</h3>
<p>— 田青</p>
<p>南方的夏季，熱得使人想整天都浸在冷水裏，才會覺得痛快。然而在辦公室裏除掉用扇子扇幾下之外，還得用衣衫包着汗水在幹生活。</p>
<p>整天埋在案頭儘寫，使腦子裏脤滿了雜亂的字，神志也被一些毫無意味的句了擾昏了。眼睛由紙上一移動開來，便會有着失明的現象，一個房子雖是那麼狹小，此時却感到太遼闊了，就是排在身邊的東西，也覺到它們站得太遠了！幾乎是在目力所能達到的範圍以外。要是把眼睛瞧一下窗外炎烈的太陽，那簡直像中了催淚性的毒氣似地，眼膜發痛，眼淚便也簌簌地溜下來了。</p>
<p>挨到下班的時候，天已經快黑了，地平綫上沒有留下一絲太陽的餘影，只有遠天的晚霞，還在發着光輝。我移動着非常煩累的身體，踱出了這吃人的機關，眼前就像有無數的烏鴉，雜亂地飛着，飛着……我剛跨出機關的柵門，前邊有條黑影使我站住了，我用着很大的努力，想瞧清楚這阻在眼前的，到底是件什麼東西：經過一個長久的時間，才看出了原來是一個非常憔悴的孩子，赤着一雙足，身上雖然有一套鄉下孩慣穿的短褲和背心，但是已經破碎得沒有一塊完整的地方，肩頭還背着一顶上了年紀的箸笠。他向我伸着一隻手，似乎還懇求地喊我一聲“先生！”菜靑的臉，佈滿飢餓的傷痕，也透露着原野裏的孩子所特有的羞澀。</p>
<p>“什麼！”我的眼睛有點兇狠地張大着，似乎在工作的疲勞中所積壓下的煩鬰。都要向這一點東西上發泄出來。這短短的兩個字的詰問，馬上在小孩子的心裏發生了恐怖的反應，他只更低微地重覆一聲“先生！”而且那隻伸出的手，也微微起着顫抖。這使我奇怪了，最初我以為他是一個小化子，現在我感覺到自己判別力的錯誤，好奇心使我暫時忘記了自己的疲倦，咻咻地問到他的家况，為什麽一個人在這門口截斷人的去路？</p>
<p>我的問話，像是一根有毒的刺，錐傷了他小小的心靈；話這還說出口來，小眼睛上已經濕潤着淚水了：</p>
<p>“先生，我是有家的，家在離這兒十里路的溪口，父親從前是種田的，也有過一個媽媽，可是……”</p>
<p>“那麼你為什麼一個人跑來城裏，有親戚嗎？我性急地問着，我懷疑這孩子是迷了路，或者遭受了匪人的拐變</p>
<p>“不，我是來找我父親的，他已經十天沒有回去了。”</p>
<p>“怎麼，你的父親住城裏？”</p>
<p>“是的，他在城裏，他說他來城裏拉車。”</p>
<p>“那麼你的父親在那段拉車呢？”</p>
<p>“我不知道，他，他已經十天沒有回去了!我肚裏餓，我餓了二天了，找他也找不到……</p>
<p>晚飯後科長室的留音機，又唱出“毛毛雨”那隻肉麻的歌曲，柵欄外我對着這可憐的孩子，不知怎樣是好，我想走開，但却又走不開。</p>
<p>然而不走開又怎樣辦呢？</p>

<h3>Kong Xiangxi Meets with Hull to Discuss Financial and Economic Issues</h3>
<p>Also Met with the U.S. Treasury Secretary Once; Busy with Social Engagements During Stay in the United States</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Minister of Finance Dr. Kong Xiangxi met with Secretary of State Hull today to discuss general financial and commercial issues in the Far East. Chinese Ambassador to the United States Dr. Wang Zhengting was also present. The content of the talks was not announced. When Kong arrived here today, the Director of the Far Eastern Affairs Department of the State Department, Hornbeck, Ambassador Wang, and more than 50 Chinese overseas Chinese went to the station to welcome him. Kong first went to the embassy to rest, and then visited the Secretary of State. After the talks, Hull hosted a luncheon for Minister Kong. Those invited to accompany him included Eccles, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board; Taylor, Undersecretary of the Treasury; Jones, Director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation; Pierson, President of the Export-Import Bank; Woodring, Secretary of War; and Ambassador Wang and other important figures from both China and the United States. Local officials believe that Kong's visit to the United States is of a "educational" nature, as he aims to show Europe and the United States the unprecedented progress of China's industry and economic construction. At the same time, he also wants to create a suitable atmosphere so that he can obtain credit from the United States when there is a special need. Pierson, the president of the U.S. Export-Import Bank's visit to China, is a sign of the United States' deep attention to China's construction plans. Therefore, it is believed here that a formal announcement will be made soon after Kong's arrival in the United States. Observers also said that Kong's trip is similar to the situation when Song Ziwen came to the United States before the U.S. loan to China for cotton and wheat in 1933. Therefore, everyone speculates that Kong must be preparing to borrow from the United States, but the purpose of the loan has not yet been announced. However, linking the feelings of the United Kingdom and the United States is certainly also Kong's main policy. (28th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau announced today that he had met with Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, but "only talked about the friendship between the two countries." When asked whether a communiqué would be issued on this conversation in the future, the Secretary of the Treasury only said "I don't know." As for the silver issue, the Secretary of the Treasury's answer was incomprehensible. It is impossible to determine whether it was discussed today or will be discussed in the future. Some authoritative sources believe that the Secretary of the Treasury's words imply that the U.S. does not intend to raise the silver issue unless Kong raises it. Moreover, since China has stable exchange rates and sufficient reserves, there is no need to sell silver at present. (28th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Washington] Dr. Kong Xiangxi met with Jones, director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, again today. It is said that Jones and Pierson, president of the Export-Import Bank, will announce the results of Pierson's recent visit to China tomorrow. The content has not been disclosed today, but it is known that Pierson has studied the possibility of funding the export of machinery industry and railway supplies to China. Jones is the person who previously handled the Sino-American cotton and wheat loan. In addition, according to senior Chinese officials here today, someone recently suggested to Kong Xiangxi to lend money to China to consolidate domestic debts with high interest rates. However, this proposal did not originate from the United States, but mostly from the United Kingdom. Kong is very interested in this financial reorganization plan, because the 8% interest rate on domestic debt is indeed too high. However, Kong does not intend to borrow foreign debt to start new businesses. The old government's revenue deposits and foreign exchange surplus are sufficient to cope with them. Pierson also told reporters from the Associated Press today that he was satisfied with the current state of China's railways, and that the unification of the routes has also made great progress. Tonight, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting hosted a banquet for Kong. Many important officials from the Ministry of Finance, silver experts, and bankers were invited, including Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau, Undersecretary Taylor, Balance Fund expert Lochhead, Senators Sheppard, King, William, McNary, and Thomas, President of the Rural Finance Corporation Eccles, and Pierson. When Hull hosted a banquet for Kong this afternoon, members of the Democratic and Republican parties of the House Banking and Currency Committee were invited to attend. (28th National Telegraph)</p>

Vice President Kong and others got out of the car in the midst of enthusiastic welcome and took a car to the new embassy to rest. His entourage stayed at the Sheridan Hotel. The cars in which Kong and others were riding totaled more than 30, and military police rode motorcycles to protect and lead the way. At that time, all traffic was temporarily suspended to allow the cars of the distinguished guests to pass without hindrance. After Vice President Kong arrived at the embassy, he came to the embassy balcony to give a brief speech to the welcoming personnel. Later, at 10:00 am, he went to the old embassy at 19th Street to attend the memorial week. All the staff of the embassy, ​​students studying in the United States, and overseas Chinese participated.

<h3>Flood Prevention Work Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Continuous days of wind and rain have caused floods everywhere. The Yellow River in Shandong is being directly impacted by the heavy flow. The Li Sheng Tun Dam has collapsed. The Jiangshui River in Wuhan has overflowed and risen wildly, breaking the record of the previous year. The fierce flow of the Yongding River and the rising of the Nan Hun River are frightening. In other places, such as the Ganjiang River in Jiangxi, the Minjiang River in Fujian, the Qiantang River and Lanjiang River in Zhejiang, and the Dongjiang River and Hanjiang River in Guangdong, either only the riverbanks are flooded, or the dikes and weirs are broken through. They echo each other, as if singing in chorus, taking advantage of the time to wreak havoc and harm the people. The railway tracks are destroyed and transportation is blocked. The disaster is already pitiful. The city walls of Fujian have also suffered water disasters within two weeks. People's homes have been destroyed and they have no way to cook. Coffins and corpses float everywhere. The scene is sad and indescribable. Now it is still the season of the Yellow Plum rain. Major and minor floods are already threatening each other. In a blink of an eye, the big flood season will begin. The situation will definitely be more rampant. If we do not plan ahead now, how can we ensure peace in the future? We do not hesitate to talk about it as an old saying and disturb the ears of the current sages, just to fulfill our responsibility to remind them.</p>
<p>Floods have long been a major enemy of the people's livelihood in our country. The key is that proper guidance can fortunately avoid it for a while. The serious disaster situation in the 20th year of the Republic of China is still stored in our hearts. The tragic impressions of the previous year are even more vivid. The wounds have not healed and the hidden pain is deep. Learning from the past and knowing the future, we should think about preventive measures when the new disaster comes. However, ordinary people are accustomed to following the old ways and are reluctant to change. Officials only seek to deal with things perfunctorily and cannot distinguish between urgent and important matters. Therefore, there are often many statements in the court, but there is no way to compromise. Documents are delivered, but there are no practical results. This is okay in peaceful times, but during the great floods, delaying things will only delay the opportunity. Therefore, today's flood prevention must be done with one heart and one mind, working together to think about disaster relief as if it were our own problem, and using all our strength to eliminate the sudden crisis. Everyone should shake off the lax spirit and strive for quick responses in everything. Even if the torrents are extremely difficult to control, we can still prevent them from happening now. The fact that we were able to safely pass through the autumn floods last year proves that it was not only due to natural disasters, but also due to the efforts of human beings. This year, we have inherited the surplus of last year's prosperity. I am really afraid that the officials will be complacent about the recent achievements and forget the past failures. Therefore, I specially put forward this suggestion to remind them to examine themselves. I sincerely hope that the responsible parties can handle this flood prevention work with more precise planning and more resolute efforts.</p>
<h3>French New Cabinet Announces Policy Guidelines to the House</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Speculation and Maintain Finances; Focus on Peace and Social Progress</p>
<p>[Paris] The new cabinet attended the House of Representatives for the first time at 3:00 PM today, and Premier Chautemps immediately read out the policy guidelines, stating, "The most urgent responsibility of the current government, and the reason for its establishment, is to immediately take strict measures to curb speculation, maintain France's gold reserves, meet the needs of the treasury, maintain budget balance, regulate commodity prices, and revive the national economy." As for the financial reorganization bill proposed by Finance Minister Bonnet, which advocates authorizing the government to take swift action to deal with contingencies, the cabinet is willing to bear full political responsibility. The cabinet is willing to establish good understanding with the Senate and the House of Representatives, and is committed to continuing cooperation with the Popular Front. "The two basic ideals that Republicans have particularly emphasized over the years are peace and social progress. The current government will do its best to implement them. As for diplomacy, the current government will continue to maintain traditional foreign policy within the scope of international justice and the independence of all nations, with the current friendship and the League of Nations as its destination, and strive to expand international cooperation to the greatest extent possible. All forms of coercive measures will be consistently rejected, and threats from others will never be tolerated. In addition, we must maintain maximum national defense to ensure national security. "We hereby appeal to the people and governments of all countries to sincerely support economic cooperation and limit armaments, so that lasting cooperative relationships can be established among the people of all countries." As for domestic affairs, any actions that undermine the recently established social laws will not be recognized under the current circumstances. The current government will also promote mutual trust between labor and management, so that these social laws can be adapted to the needs of the national economy. In addition, there are various reforms that remain to be carried out, such as the extension of the validity of work contracts signed by labor and management in industry and commerce, the revision of rents and commercial debt interest rates, amnesty for those who violate the press law, and the promotion of agricultural education and agricultural organizations. The above are all major issues that must be gradually implemented in light of the country's economic capacity, and cannot be achieved overnight. At this time, we can only "temporarily suspend" various social legislation works in accordance with the policy set by the previous cabinet. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)</p>

<h3>French House of Representatives Passes Vote of Confidence in Chautemps Cabinet</h3>
<p>Agricultural Improvement Bill to be Discussed Today; Financial Reorganization Bill Also to be Proposed</p>
<p>[Paris] Premier Chautemps recently read out a declaration of policy guidelines in the House of Representatives, stating that the current government is determined to take the public opinion expressed in the general election as its guiding principle. When he mentioned foreign policy, members of the left-wing parties repeatedly applauded. The Premier said, "Peace cannot be sought through surrender. The result of surrender is only enslavement and war." When Premier Chautemps criticized financial chaos and announced the government's decision to crack down on speculation, members of the central parties, and even some members of the right-wing parties, applauded along with the left-wing members. Premier Chautemps then requested the House of Representatives to postpone questioning the government's general policies, and submitted this request as a motion of confidence for a vote, stating, "It is now suggested to adopt a simple procedure, please the House of Representatives express confidence in the current government, and hope that the spokespersons of all parties briefly explain their attitudes, and I will briefly answer." After the Premier finished his speech, Communist Representative Renaud immediately took the stage and said, "The content of the political program, especially the agricultural reform, needs to be supplemented and explained urgently. The Communist Party is willing to express its confidence in the current government and requests that the House of Representatives not adjourn before passing the agricultural bill." The leader of the right-wing Republican Democratic Union, Maran, and the chairman of the central Democratic Alliance party group, Bardy, then delivered short speeches. Premier Chautemps then gave a general response and told Renaud that the cabinet will discuss the agricultural bill tomorrow. He then praised former Premier Blum and said, "Reorganizing finances is the responsibility and honor of Republicans." At this point, the House of Representatives passed the motion of confidence with 393 votes against 142. Finance Minister Bonnet then formally submitted the financial reorganization bill to the Finance Committee of the House of Representatives, and proposed to extend the meeting until 9:00 PM, so that the committee could engage in discussions during the extended meeting. The House of Representatives also announced an extension of the meeting at 4:10 PM. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)</p>
<h3>French Stock Exchange Closed for One Day</h3>
<p>England Suspends Trading in Francs</p>
<p>[Paris] All national stock exchanges and commodities exchanges have been ordered to close for one day, and debtors who need to pay for various bills in foreign currency or in cash can apply for an extension. The Ministry of Finance took preventive measures for fear that speculators might take the opportunity to manipulate the market price of the franc during the discussion of the financial reorganization bill proposed by Finance Minister Bonnet in the Senate and the House of Representatives, and there is no special significance to it.

<h3>French Financial Counselor Visits British Authorities</h3>
<p>Says Willing to Continue Cooperation</p>
<p>[London] French Financial Counselor to the British Embassy, Moyik, visited the British Treasury authorities this morning, informing them of the measures taken by the French government in finance, and declaring that the French government is willing to continue cooperating with the United States and Britain in accordance with the Tripartite Monetary Agreement. On this issue, British financial circles believe that the franc's exchange rate should be allowed to rise and fall on its own, as was done before the late French Premier Poincaré stabilized the franc on June 24, 1928. This approach is in line with the current situation and is generally supported by British financial circles. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)</p>
<h3>International Exchange Equalization Fund</h3>
<p>British House of Commons Passes Increase</p>
<p>[London] The British House of Commons today passed a resolution authorizing the government to increase the Exchange Equalization Fund from £350 million to £550 million. Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon claimed when proposing the bill that the government would not suffer a sharp loss of gold, which would lead to inaction. As of March 30, the Exchange Equalization Fund had a total of 26,644,000 ounces of cash, and the Bank of England stored 73,842,000 ounces of gold on the same day. Simon believes that this amount of gold reserves is not excessive, and the reason for the increase in the Exchange Equalization Fund is the transfer of floating capital. After that, the gold storage accounts every six months can be published three months after the end of each period. Furthermore, the existing policy will not be changed, because this policy is extremely important in ensuring and fulfilling the Tripartite Monetary Agreement under the current international situation. (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] When asked if the French financial situation had any impact on the operation of the Tripartite Monetary Agreement between the United States, Britain, and France, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau replied that the operation of the agreement had not changed, and also said that the amount of the U.S. Exchange Equalization Fund would not be increased.

<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Political and Economic Power of Japan's First Zaibatsu, Mitsui (3)</h3>
<p>— Nagumo</p>
<p>(5) Seihin Ikeda's Leadership in Politics</p>
<p>Who helped Mitsui transform from being threatened by fascism to leading fascism? This is Seihin Ikeda.</p>
<p>Seihin Ikeda is the "manager" of the Mitsui family, having served Mitsui for more than forty years. The Mitsui family trusts him very much. In the past twenty years, Mitsui capital has been completely under his guidance, so in fact, he is also the leader of Japanese capitalism.</p>
<p>The Mitsui family's reliance on externally hired "managers" did not begin with Seihin Ikeda, and there is a historical basis for this. The Mitsui family's family precepts have always stated: "The key to commerce lies in being able to employ appropriate talents, and it is necessary to eliminate the old and employ the new." The formulation of the family precepts dates back to before the Meiji Restoration, and the vision of the founders of the Mitsui family is truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Each stage of Mitsui's development is due to the planning of strategists. The first phase was helping the Meiji Restoration to break away from the oppression of the feudal shogunate. This undertaking was completed single-handedly by San Nomura, the then "manager" of Mitsui. During the war, the Mitsui family suffered no small sacrifices, but after the war, Mitsui obtained many benefits from the government. This is the first foundation for the smooth development of the Mitsui kingdom.</p>
<p>The second phase was guiding Mitsui from commercial capital to industrial capital, and this was done by two other Mitsui "managers," Kawa Nakakami and Takashi Masuda. After Kawa Nakakami and Takashi Masuda, came today's Seihin Ikeda.</p>
<p>When the Ugaki Cabinet failed and the Hayashi Cabinet was formed, everyone knew that the Hayashi Cabinet was a strong cabinet with a more pronounced fascist character. However, the Minister of Finance of the Hayashi Cabinet, Toyotaro Yuki, joined hands with Mitsui strategist Seihin Ikeda (Ikeda took office as the president of the Bank of Japan). Isn't Seihin Ikeda faithfully representing the interests of Mitsui? From this cooperation, the future of Japanese fascism can be foreseen—that is, taking off the disguise of being anti-zaibatsu and helping to strengthen financial capital control.</p>
<p>Now, among those who are anti-zaibatsu in Japan, there are already many who secretly fawn on the zaibatsu. This is the progress of the zaibatsu's work, and it is also the great achievement of Ikeda Seihin, the leader of the zaibatsu. Ikeda Seihin is the highest mechanic who is loyal to the zaibatsu and promotes the structure of Japanese capitalism.</p>
<p>After the "February 26th" incident, Ikeda, on the one hand, used the relationship of the Kokuhonsha (a Japanese fascist group, most of whose members were soldiers, which was disbanded after the "February 26th" incident) to connect with the upper echelons of the military. On the other hand, he built Mitsui, expressed a shift in direction, and sent overtures to society and young soldiers. At the same time, he used the Osaka Political and Economic Research Association to support existing political parties as much as possible. As a result, from the end of last autumn, political parties began to become active. Baba's finances only slightly cared for the rural areas because of the emphasis on the military's advocated broad national defense, so he could not help but declare his downfall under the resistance of the capitalists.</p>
<p>The success of the Yuki finances lies in sacrificing the rural areas, which everyone admits. If the interests of the rural areas are neglected, what is the meaning of "broad national defense"? However, there is already the following argument in the military:</p>
<p>"In order to complete the national defense plan, it is necessary to avoid friction with the financial community. At present, expanding productive capacity is more necessary than anything else. National defense policy can only have a way out if it is harmonized with financial capital and military demand industrial capital."</p>
<p>The military has retreated from broad national defense to narrow national defense. Strengthening "Manchukuo" is the unanimous call of the "military" and "financial" circles in Japan. The slogans of "overthrowing the zaibatsu" and "reviving the rural areas" have been collected in the historical library. The fascist heroes who launched the "February 26th" incident are either dead, imprisoned, or "purged" from active military personnel. Even radical factions like Itagaki can't get ahead now. The one who is guiding politics is Seihin Ikeda—the spokesperson for the Mitsui zaibatsu. Japanese fascism is changing! It will change from "anti-zaibatsu" to "pro-zaibatsu."</p>
<p>In fact, this is the progress of Japanese fascism, and this is the fundamental meaning of fascism's existence.</p>
<p>Recently, Mitsui invested 30 million yen to open an aircraft manufacturing plant. Unless the existing social structure is fundamentally destroyed, the zaibatsu will always have a way. Ikeda's current appointment as the president of the Bank of Japan is another new stage in the development of Japanese financial capital. As for the profound impact on Japanese society and the international situation as a result, that is beyond the scope of this article.</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy Oppose British and French Supervision of the Spanish Issue</h3>
<p>Believes it Destroys the European Balance of Power; Non-Intervention Committee Adjourns</p>
<p>[London] The representatives of the nine countries of the Non-Intervention Committee met here today. The representatives of Germany and Italy expressed their opposition to the British and French plans to supervise all Spanish naval affairs, and the meeting was adjourned until Friday to allow the representatives of each country to consult with their own governments and make a final decision. (29th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee on Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War recently issued a communiqué stating that Italian Representative Grandi had declared that since the implementation of the measure prohibiting volunteers from joining the two sides in the Spanish civil war in December of last year, no volunteers from Italy had gone to the country, and all rumors were false. At this point, the chairman of the Adjustment Committee, British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, explained the new maritime supervision plan proposed by Britain and France. The representatives of Germany and Italy immediately agreed to consult their respective governments and, in principle, raised objections, stating that all plans that cannot maintain a balance between the countries are inconvenient to endorse, and that all personnel from these countries who are engaged in supervision work on the land borders of Spain should be ordered to withdraw. After the representatives of other countries agreed to consult with their respective governments, Chairman Lord Plymouth also raised the issue of volunteer withdrawal. French Representative Corbin immediately, on behalf of his government, proposed that foreign combatants who have been injured or captured should be withdrawn immediately, and that an agreement must be established. The subcommittee adjourned until July 2 to discuss the two issues of volunteer withdrawal and the new maritime supervision plan. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Spanish issue, the new maritime supervision plan proposed by Britain and France has been objected to by Germany and Italy. British officials recently declared that this was the result of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's firm request to Germany yesterday afternoon to act in concert. After the German government agreed, it immediately ordered its ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, to return to London immediately to respond to the situation. As a result, the supervisory system will be declared over, and the countries concerned will contact each other within this week in order to restore the original situation in December of last year, that is, each country declared neutrality, but Germany and Italy have reserved the right to reconsider the entire issue of the non-intervention policy, or may propose a counter-proposal. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Spanish Supervision Measures Now on the Verge of Extinction</h3>
<p>Britain Still Adheres to the Non-Intervention Policy; Italian Newspapers Say There Will Be Major Developments</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the future of the Spanish non-intervention supervision measures, general observers are pessimistic, believing that the supervision measures will inevitably disappear sooner or later, but it is said that Britain seems to have obtained a guarantee from Germany that it will never attack the Spanish Republican government in the future. At the same time, the chairman of the Adjustment Committee, British Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, held talks with French Ambassador Corbin today and made a final decision on the Spanish maritime supervision plan proposed by Britain and France. The plan stipulates that Britain and France will be responsible for the supervision work of the Spanish seas in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, respectively, and will also assign neutral inspectors to board the warships participating in the supervision to show credibility. This plan will be submitted by Lord Plymouth to the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee tomorrow, and the representatives of each country will be asked to approve it or propose alternative suggestions. At that time, the German representative will probably ask for a considerable amount of time to send a message to Berlin for instructions, and the Italian representative will also take this attitude. According to the impression gained by the general public, Germany and Italy do not agree, and it is expected that Germany can accept it in principle, while Italy is not necessarily. Therefore, this issue must be decided after the representatives of Germany and Italy have received instructions from their respective governments before the subcommittee can be convened for a final decision. (Central News Agency, 28th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] With Germany and Italy withdrawing from the Spanish coast supervision plan, the filling of the gap by Britain and France has been opposed by Germany and Italy. Italian newspapers have recently launched a fierce attack on Britain, and the Forum newspaper said, "If we clearly say that there will be major new developments in Spain in a few days, it is not revealing any secrets." According to the remarks made by Mussolini's mouthpiece Gaida in Rome, Germany and Italy cannot allow Britain and France to monopolize the Spanish coast supervision plan. This remark can well represent the official opinion and says that the monopolization of the Spanish coast by Britain and France will cause the expansion of communist forces in Spain. Gaida also expressed his approval of Hitler's speech in Würzburg on Sunday, saying that the experience gained by Germany in Spain is an indelible lesson, and proved the prediction of the early victory of Spanish National Army leader General Franco, which shows that Italy has now adopted a stronger attitude. In addition, German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop has returned to Britain from Berlin and has probably been specifically instructed on the filling of the Spanish coast supervision gap by Britain and France. According to people close to the German Foreign Ministry, the Non-Intervention Committee is likely to encounter difficulties, because Germany and Italy will express doubts and fears. If the committee cannot make a decision that satisfies the two countries, then the old agreements, such as the agreement in December 1936 stipulating that each country should individually avoid intervention in the Spanish war, can be re-submitted. If so, the entire supervision plan will become a harmless thing. (Central News Agency, 29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden, in response to several questions raised by members of the House of Commons, confirmed the intention of Britain and France to replace Germany and Italy in undertaking the entire Spanish maritime supervision work. Labour Member of Parliament Feller then asked whether the attitude taken by Germany and Italy was sufficient to endanger the policy of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Eden replied that Britain had decided to adhere to the non-intervention policy. (Central News Agency, 28th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Prime Minister van Zeeland's Speech and Impression of Visiting the United States</h3>
<p>Removing Trade Barriers: America Inclined to Assist</p>
<p>[New York] Prime Minister van Zeeland of Belgium recently delivered a speech at a banquet of the American Foreign Policy Association, briefly stating that his impressions from this trip concerned two matters: curbing the arms race and removing international trade barriers. The U.S. government is determined to participate in resolving these issues. "According to several factors, the world economy is already showing signs of improvement, but this is more pronounced in the domestic economies than in the global economy. The improvement in the domestic and foreign economies of some countries is partly due to the expansion of armaments, which is an artificial method of promotion. Most other countries have faced various economic and political difficulties since the economic panic of 1929. Even countries with economic recovery are hampered by the turbulent international situation. International trade is unable to develop effectively due to various countries' restrictions on capital flow and the confusion in the monetary situation. The only way to alleviate this is for countries to remove tariff barriers. I know that all countries in the world do not want to see war, but some countries, due to economic difficulties, may also cause war. It is rumored that my trip is to represent Europe to borrow money from the United States to reorganize finances and finance, which is not true." Prime Minister van Zeeland is scheduled to go to Washington tomorrow afternoon at the invitation of President Roosevelt for lunch, and then return home on the French mail ship "Normandie" on the 30th.

The Pravda also published news from Bolshoy, stating that Japan and "Manchukuo" often violated the Soviet border on the Heilongjiang River. For example, the "Manchukuo"-affiliated gunboats "Dingjiang" and "Qinren" entered Soviet territory near Noyagoe on May 21. On June 1, a "Manchukuo" small boat carrying many soldiers landed near the Soviet Konstantinovka and set up outposts. On June 19, another seventy "Manchukuo" soldiers invaded the vicinity of Konstantinovka and were repelled by the Soviet border guards.

<h3>US Democratic Party Member Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>Most Willing to Help with New Deal Legislation Program</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt and members of the Democratic Party in both the Senate and the House of Representatives held a three-day meeting on Jefferson Island. Although the participants disagreed on the meeting, it is heard that the US President has gained a lot of support for his legislative program. Dissenters in the party advocated that Congress should adjourn as soon as possible to avoid an open split within the Democratic Party, and the enthusiasm can gradually become cold. However, the US President strongly stated the necessity for Congress to pass his legislative program. It is heard that most of the congressmen have been moved by the President's remarks, and it is expected that the Supreme Court Reform Bill will be submitted to the Senate within half a month.

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>National Defense Money (15)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Uncle Di</p>
<p>(C) Content – The content is really too vast and too detailed. Here, only a general outline is provided. Except for judicial independence, which is not included here, all other aspects of measures are generally included and listed. The main objects are political and economic aspects. The political part roughly includes: rectifying officialdom, reorganizing the police, clarifying land, investigating household registration, changing etiquette and customs, organizing relief work, improving sanitation, reforming village administration, promoting local autonomy, rectifying land taxes, reorganizing old taxes, promoting new taxes, reorganizing financial administration, developing financial undertakings, reorganizing schools, promoting social education, and so on. The economic part includes five items: agriculture, industry, commerce, mining, and transportation. Regarding agriculture, there are regulations on water conservancy, cotton planting, forest reclamation, animal husbandry, and other agricultural promotion agencies and guidance facilities, such as cooperative undertakings, experimental farms, and so on. The industrial part is divided into mechanical industry, dyeing and weaving industry, electrical industry, chemical industry, and so on. The commercial part includes reorganizing finance, encouraging exports, reducing imports, public commercial undertakings, commercial surveys and guidance, cultivating and employing people in villages, and so on. The mining part includes developing unoperated mines, reorganizing operated mines, establishing mining agencies, raising mining capital, and so on. The transportation part includes: railway plans, highway plans, waterway plans, telephone plans, postal and telegraph plans, and so on. The outline of the plan can be divided into the following points: ㊀ Main points. ㊁ A total of three parts are listed: Part 1, General Rules, with six clauses. Part 2, Department of Provincial Construction. Part 3, Department of County and Village Construction. Part 2 is further divided into four chapters: (A) Political aspects. There are two sections: Section 1, Improving the current political system. Items such as "must be achieved" and "expected to be achieved" are listed separately. Section 2, Completing local autonomy, which is further divided into eight clauses. (B) Economic aspects, with three sections: ㊀ Increasing people's production, divided into three clauses. ㊁ Developing public undertakings, with "clauses". ㊂ Facilities for economic control in provinces, counties, and villages, divided into two clauses. (C) Provincial Government Construction Research Institute, divided into four sections. (D) Supplementary provisions, divided into four clauses. Part 3 is the Department of County and Village Construction. (Specifies that county and village administrative plans should be compiled by the county and village themselves.) The last part is the appendix, with two clauses.</p>
<p>This is the general content of the once-famous "Ten-Year Construction Plan of Shanxi Province." However, in addition to this, the authorities in Shanxi once specifically stated: "The political and economic matters listed in this plan are only those that are currently included in the plan and can be generally determined; those that are not included in this plan but should be organized at any time within ten years should be organized, and it does not mean that matters not listed in this plan are administrative matters." Therefore, its content can still be added at any time as needed by the environment. Looking at the essence and intention of such a large-scale plan, I think it is not impossible to say that it is a mutated form of total mobilization.</p>
<p>(D) Time Limit and Steps – Why exactly is it set as "ten years"? According to the explanation of the authorities in Shanxi, there are two aspects of reasons: domestic environment and foreign environment. Domestically, they believe that our political and social situation is not on the right track, so at the beginning, it takes three to five years to remove obstacles to construction and prepare for the implementation of construction. China must become strong, and Shanxi cannot be an exception. As for the foreign environment, according to the estimate of the Shanxi authorities at the time, within ten years, all the naval, land, and air force preparations of the major powers will be completed, and then the East Asian problem will be completely resolved. Therefore, "China must have a solution within these ten years, and it will be too late if it is delayed." At the same time, they also stated: Although it is set for ten years, it would be better if it can be completed in less than ten years.</p>
<p>According to the opinions of the authorities in Shanxi, the steps to implement this plan can be divided into two aspects: the first three years, with politics as the center, focusing on removing obstacles to construction and establishing the foundation of democratic politics; the last seven years, with economy as the center, to achieve the goal of self-sufficiency. However, the division of steps is only based on the emphasis, and it does not mean that the first three years are all political construction and there is no economic construction; or that the last seven years are only economic construction and there is no political construction.</p>
<p>This plan was finalized at the end of the twenty-first year, and it has been four or five years now. If calculated according to the initial calculation of the Shanxi authorities, then it should be exactly the time to step into the second stage.</p>
<p>(E) Final Purpose—What exactly is the final purpose of this "Ten-Year Plan"? We can already deduce this from the motive for their creation of this plan. Here, I would like to describe the specific goals hoped for by the authorities in Shanxi. According to their explanation, what they hope for after the implementation of this plan is: in the political aspect, Shanxi should achieve thorough democracy; in the economic aspect, Shanxi should achieve "the situation where the social and economic income is more than the expenditure." In this way, national defense has protection and a foundation. At the same time, they have a further explanation for the increase in the so-called "social economy," that is: "At least, it can reach an average increase of 20 yuan in production value per person per year."</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Chenchuan, the highest authority in charge of this plan, once said: "Methods can be changed at any time within a reasonable scope; the purpose must not be shaken."</p>
<p>(F) Implementation Methods and Determination—The authorities in Shanxi also know that it is "a pioneering initiative in the political history of China" to implement such a large and arduous plan with the political power of a province. Its significance is nothing less than turning "a government with accumulated abuses into a productive government." They also anticipated the difficulties ahead, so in terms of specific methods, they intend to adapt to the environment and change at any time. Moreover, they plan to set up a research institute first, and designate Yangqu, Taiyuan, and Yuci as experimental areas, hoping to obtain theories from practice and methods from experience. The methods to be promoted temporarily are: ㊀ The Shanxi authorities implement performance appraisal methods to urge the people to produce with political power. ㊁ All departments, offices, bureaus, and county governments must bear the responsibility of supervising and guiding the fish based on the plan. ㊂ Establish a dedicated agency for the implementation plan to strive to promote it. ㊃ It is hoped that "no matter the agency, group, or individual, anyone who has a share of responsibility should do their part and never shirk or perfunctorily."</p>
<p>When we examine the methods used by the Shanxi authorities to promote the plan, we always feel that it is a bit vague and not very certain. However, this shortcoming can be remedied in part by the determination of the Shanxi authorities.</p>
<p>They clearly acknowledge that it must be a very difficult task to vigorously promote this plan. However, they believe that the country has reached this point. It goes without saying how great the pain is if it is unfortunately destroyed: but to seek strength, it cannot be obtained from comfort. Mr. Yan Baichuan once had such a warning: "If this group of officials (referring to the old-fashioned Chinese officials) is gathered together and explained the necessary requirements for a strong country, and everyone votes, they certainly dare not agree to the destruction of the country, but I am afraid they dare not raise their hands to agree to the strong country." Therefore, they advocate that in order to implement this "self-improvement" plan, officials and people alike must be determined to sacrifice, endure great pain, grit their teeth, and work hard for decades. Therefore, they also advocate that during this period of promotion and construction, "negligence" crimes should be established for officials and "obstruction" crimes should be established for the people. All officials and people who cannot follow this plan shall be punished according to these two crimes. Even if this leads to a "productive terror era," it is impossible because of the national crisis, and it is also worthwhile for the sake of eliminating the national crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Yan Baichuan once stated: "The implementation of the plan requires the responsibility of the people of the whole province. It is not something that can be implemented just by my saying so. However, I really have the determination to implement it this time. I am willing to supervise the people of the whole province to do this, overcoming all difficulties and all concerns. Even though the successful construction of Shanxi Province alone cannot be said to be the overall strength of the country, the country will naturally have a part of hope if one province can embark on a new political path." This statement, in the eyes of the reporter, can be said to be precisely representative of the overall determination and ambition of the Shanxi authorities.</p>

<h3>A Poisonous Plan of a Certain Army in Guanwai to Form a Pseudo-Anti-Communist Army</h3>
<p>Using Pseudo-Army to Slaughter the Righteous Army in Chahar North, Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu are Accomplices</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence After the uprising of the people in Chahar North, the righteous flags were everywhere in Chongli, Shangyi, Shangdu, and Huade counties, and the total number of the righteous army was no less than tens of thousands. Among the leaders, in addition to Zhang Chengde and Li Tingyuan, there were also Zhang Zhongying and Li Ying. The situation was huge, and the puppet Mongolian military government was extremely shaken. Although a certain military headquarters in Guanwai had ordered a unit of the Sato Division stationed in Rehe to enter and exit Dolon to intercept the righteous army from entering the puppet Manchukuo, the Righteous Army did not dare to go deep because Shangdu and Chongli had not fallen, and the people in the puppet territory also had a tendency to raise their poles. Therefore, a certain military stationed in the puppet territory could hardly transfer a large army to attack, but strictly ordered the puppet army to strengthen the walls and clear the fields, and guard the important cities and towns of Shangdu and Huade to resist the Righteous Army. At the same time, they used the cunning scheme of Chinese killing each other, because they recruited the bandit leader Liu Guitang, who had been rampant in the Zhilu area, and the former Zhilu Army brigade commander Ma Tingfu, Xia Zhenhua, and Bai Jianwu to organize the so-called North China Anti-Communist Army, which was controlled by the North China Anti-Communist and Long Association of a certain military headquarters in Guanwai, and the Ronin Miura was in charge of the matter. Liu Guitang was the puppet commander-in-chief, Bai Jianwu was the puppet army commander, and Ma Tingfu and Xia Zhenhua were each the puppet division commander, and they secretly recruited bandits and old troops of the Zhilu Army in various parts of southern Hebei, and took Jixian and Zunhua, the puppet Jidong area, as training areas, which were responsible by Ma Tingfu and Xia Zhenhua. In the past two months, more than 5,000 people have been recruited. On June 20, Miura flew to Guanwai to receive military pay and clothing, and accompanied a certain staff officer of a certain military in Guanwai to Tianjin to meet with Liu Guitang and Bai Jianwu to give instructions and issue military supplies. Since the 26th, the pseudo-army has been crossing the Great Wall along the Gubeikou Avenue to Rehe and turning to Chahar North. In early July, they will be concentrated in Shangdu and Zhangbei to listen to the roll call of Tanaka, the head of the special agency stationed in Jiabusi by a certain party, and then Liu Guitang will command and divide the guerrilla righteous army near Shangdu and Huade. Liu Guitang himself, accompanied by Miura, accompanied by two Ronin Baolu and several pseudo-staff members, took a certain company's plane to Zhangbei on the 26th, while Bai Jianwu temporarily stayed in a certain concession in Tianjin to negotiate. The reason why a certain military headquarters in Guanwai ordered Liu Bai to form a pseudo-Anti-Communist Army was that the uprising of the people in Chahar North was a Red Army commando team in contact with the Communist Army in Shaanxi, which would invade the puppet Manchukuo, and even ordered Liu Bai to slaughter it. Its intention was very sinister.</p>
<p>It is also heard that more than 10,000 pseudo-Anti-Communist Army symbols have been made and transported from Tianjin to Chahar North on the 24th. A certain party ordered the six divisions recruited by Liu Bai to be divided into two armies so that they can lead them separately. Therefore, there are still traitors left by Liu Bai secretly recruiting in Daming, Anci, Wuqing, Youan, Xinghao, and Mancheng, and sending them to Zunji counties for training. (28th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Land Administration Bureau's Assessment of Land Prices Violates Procedures</h3>
<p>Landowners Present to Various Agencies to Correct and Request Handling in Accordance with Legal Procedures</p>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence The Land Administration Bureau recently announced the land prices in this county, but its assessment procedures did not follow the prescribed procedures, so all people in the county expressed opposition. Recently, Li Xiuzhe and other landlords in the second district specially presented to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Land Administration Bureau, the County Party Department, the County Government, and the County Land Administration Bureau to request legal correction. The original presentation is as follows: "For the matter of estimating land prices in violation of statutory procedures, please request legal correction. I have checked that land administration agencies have certain procedures for estimating land prices. Articles 239 to 243 of the Land Law and Articles 65 and 66 of the Land Law Implementation Law are detailed. Land prices are the standard for tax collection and are of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood. Therefore, when handling estimates, specialists must be appointed, and specialists must be appointed and qualified (Article 237 of the Land Law). It is by no means something that anyone can fabricate out of thin air. The land prices in this county have been announced by the county government in early this month. Except for the special zone that has not been fully announced, the farmland and residential land in each district exceed the market price by nearly double, and some are even more than double. When asking the people's representatives, they all said that they had never heard of it beforehand. Looking at the county bureau and the disclosure places in each district, there is no announcement of the colored price zoning map (Article 240 of the same law). According to the county notification, "I have checked that the land price zone standard land prices of each district, township, and township in this county have been estimated and completed by the County Land Administration Bureau, and should be announced separately in accordance with regulations." This shows that the announced land prices are only based on the estimation of your bureau, and have not been submitted to the county government for review, or to the people's representative agency for resolution (Article 66 of the Land Law Implementation Law). It is clear that since the statutory procedures have not been followed, whether the statutory calculation methods have been followed during the estimation, and whether the various amounts calculated have been listed separately and explained (same article), the county government and the people's representative agency, which are legally empowered to review and resolve, cannot know the details, and of course cannot be regarded as the standard land price. The method for calculating improper relief specified in Article 246 of the Land Law is based on the premise of a legal standard land price and cannot be applied to this case similar to the land price appointed by the emperor. The county government is busy with government affairs, or does not pay much attention to its review powers, and hastily issues an announcement. The people's representative agency, as the voice of the people, is not willing to give up its responsibility for resolution and has already fought for it according to law. Its presenters each have real estate and have a vital interest in whether the land price estimated by the Land Administration Bureau is appropriate. Now that the land price has doubled, the land price tax will inevitably be increased by one fold. When estimating, the people's right to resolve was deprived, and when taxing, the people's hard-earned money was exploited. They had no choice but to rise up in opposition. They urgently petitioned your bureau in joint names to handle the matter in accordance with legal procedures and correct the illegality of estimating land prices so that standard land prices can be produced. It is really for the public convenience. Sincerely presented, Li Xiuzhe, the presenter of the Songjiang County Second District Landowners, and the 5,065 co-signers, including Sheng Jiahuang, etc."</p>
<h3>The Severe Henan Disaster; Epidemics Resurge and Locusts Swarm Suddenly</h3>
<p>Hopes for Relief are Especially Urgent</p>
<p>A telegram from Kaifeng states: Henan Province suffered a severe drought last year. Crops and trees withered, and there was no hope for harvest, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. Starving people were found everywhere, and there were cries of woe across the land. The disaster-stricken counties numbered over ninety in the entire province. Among them, the counties in western Henan suffered the most severe disaster. However, based on the current situation, it is difficult to distinguish between the most severely affected and the next most severely affected areas. It is only a matter of those who have already died and those who are about to die. The counties in western Henan have experienced disasters nine out of ten years. The land is barren, and the people are poor, lacking reserves. The early drought last spring destroyed the wheat harvest, leaving only twenty to thirty percent. Furthermore, there was no rain after autumn, and there was no harvest of grains and cotton seeds. The winter was also extremely dry, and the wheat seedlings withered and died almost entirely. So-called wealthy families now have empty pots and pans. The bark of trees and roots of grass have been peeled and eaten entirely. Now, they are even making cakes from stone powder as food, which is not only difficult to swallow but also causes symptoms such as body swelling and constipation. In various places, disaster victims have swollen faces like basins and bodies as thin as firewood. Many are collapsing by the roadside, moaning and waiting to die. Recently, diphtheria, cholera, typhoid, and other diseases have resurfaced. Reports of disaster victims dying from illness are heard daily. Although the Shanghai Charity Federation's Henan Drought Relief Office and the Henan Provincial Relief Association have distributed emergency relief in the spring, the disaster is too severe, and there are too many disaster victims. The small amount of relief funds each person receives can at most sustain them for ten days. After that, there is still no solution. It's like a drop in the bucket, unable to alleviate the current difficulties. Although some counties have received timely rain and have planted late autumn crops, many other counties have suddenly experienced a surge of locusts, and the autumn seedlings have been eaten entirely. Even in the areas that were fortunate enough not to be eaten, there are still two to three months until harvest time. In this long-term process, the cries of woe continue. Starving disaster victims often faint in the fields while wielding their hoes. Their suffering and hardship are increasing daily. At this critical moment of life and death, if further relief is not provided, not only will the vast majority of people be unable to escape death, but also the previous relief efforts will be in vain. Therefore, under these circumstances, it is especially urgent to hope that various charitable organizations will generously contribute to provide relief.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Zhu Shaomei Arrested</p>
<p>Zhu Shaomei of this county, who formerly held a position as a military supply officer in a certain agency, embezzled over a thousand yuan of public funds. Zhu, fearing punishment, fled without a trace. It was recently learned that Zhu had secretly returned to Songjiang. On the afternoon of the 29th, the headquarters dispatched a platoon of soldiers to surround Zhu's residence. Zhu was captured on the spot and escorted to the district command for strict handling.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Smuggled Opium Intercepted at East Station</p>
<p>At 0:57 AM on the 29th, when the Beijing-Shanghai No. 8 night express train arrived at the Suzhou station, railway police discovered a smuggler transporting opium. Two kilograms of opium were found on his person, totaling forty small packages. According to his confession, his name is Wang Wenxiu, 42 years old, from Xuzhou, residing at No. 4 Defu Lane, Sichuan Road, Zhabei, Shanghai. He intended to transport the opium to Baodai Bridge for delivery and then transport it to Zhejiang for sale. He was transferred to the police station that afternoon and then sent to the main bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Japanese Officer's Unsuccessful Tour</p>
<p>Commander Okawauchi of the Japanese Naval Landing Forces stationed in China, accompanied by Chief of Staff Takeda and a party of twenty-two, arrived in Changshu on the 28th in thirteen cars for sightseeing. Jia Wenbin, an inspector from the Zhabei Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, also accompanied them with a car attendant, Guan Xuesen, and acted as guides. When they arrived at the Changshu General Station, the local police had already received the news. Chief Inspector Hong Houchang led more than ten detectives and car patrol officers to the train station to inquire about the identity of the Japanese. It was stated that they were purely for sightseeing purposes and had no other intentions. As a result, because they had no passports, Inspector Hong advised them not to enter the city. The officers lingered near the station for twenty minutes and then returned to Wuxi in their original cars. The bureau immediately notified the police stations along the line in Liantang, Yangjian, and Wuxi to be vigilant.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Dramatic Increase in Land Tax Revenue</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, considering that Cheng County's land tax arrears had accumulated to nearly four million yuan over the years, sent a clearing committee to the county at the end of last December to strictly urge payment in order to rectify the situation. In the past six months, revenue has increased dramatically. The total revenue for the province and county this year is over two million yuan, an increase of nearly one-fold compared to the annual assessment (over one million) and more than one-fold compared to the highest revenue in previous years (over nine hundred thousand). This achievement is unprecedented in many years. The reason is due to the improvement of the collection system and the effective urging of payment.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Request to Suspend Wheat Business Tax</p>
<p>The county government and the Business Tax Bureau have successively received instructions from the Department of Finance, stipulating that from July 1st, wheat shops set up by each flour mill shall collect business tax from wheat sellers on behalf of the tax authorities. The tax will be levied at a rate of 0.5% based on a standard of four yuan per dan (a unit of dry volume). The Chamber of Commerce was immediately informed by letter to notify each flour mill and wheat shop to comply. Upon receiving the order, each factory stated that the flour mill's purchase of raw wheat flour had already been regulated by the Ministry of Finance in accordance with Article 1 of the Business Tax Law, and the Department of Finance had separately issued audit guidelines, which were circulated to various counties with strict regulations. Moreover, according to Article 9 of the Business Tax Law, business tax should be paid directly to the tax authorities by the taxpayers. How could the flour mills be ordered to collect tax on behalf of the wheat sellers? According to Article 25 of the Provisional Constitution, people are not obligated to pay taxes unless required by law. The flour mills pay consolidated tax and cannot bear this responsibility. Yesterday, special telegrams were sent to the Ministries of Finance and Industry, urging the Jiangsu Department of Finance to investigate and stop this practice in order to comply with the tax law and avoid double taxation. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce was asked to appeal on behalf of the merchants, as the merchants of Jiangsu are in distress.</p>
<p>Wheat and Flour Prices Soar</p>
<p>Due to the impact of rain on the wheat in the surrounding countryside, the harvest is poor, and the wheat kernels are uneven in size. Rice shops in Beidang and Ximen Nanmen do not receive goods enthusiastically, receiving only about twenty thousand bags per day (each bag weighs 174.4 jin according to the city scale). Wheat from other provinces is rarely transported here. Recently, the goods arriving from Hexia are transported from neighboring counties such as Jiangyin, and the quantity is very small, insufficient to meet demand, causing market prices to soar. The price has risen to nine yuan and five jiao per bag. At the 5:00 PM tea party on the 29th, Hexia goods were priced at nine yuan, five jiao and five fen, and bank goods were priced at nine yuan and seven jiao. Flour mills in Shanghai such as Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Lida, Xinda, and Xiangda have instructed their wheat shops in Wuxi to purchase in large quantities, purchasing over sixty tons per day. Due to a shortage of vehicles, they are transported to Shanghai by ship. The Shanghai Stock Exchange is also purchasing wheat in Wuxi, about one thousand bags per day, to be transported to Shanghai for trading. Local flour mills in Wuxi such as Jiufeng and Maoxin have raised flour prices due to the high cost of wheat. The market price on the 29th for Green Mountain and Green Battleship flour has risen to three yuan and nine jiao and five fen per bag. In the future, wheat prices and flour prices are expected to continue to rise without decline.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Hengchun Pawnshop Rumored Arson</p>
<p>The Hengchun Pawnshop in Shijia Lane, Wuyi County, has been open for over ten years. The manager is Zhang Peishen. In normal times, its operation is among the best in the pawnshop industry throughout the county. Unexpectedly, on the 28th, many rural pledgers came to redeem their clothing and accessories. Upon investigation, it was learned that unscrupulous individuals were spreading rumors that the pawnshop would set fire to the premises, be robbed, and close down. The villagers believed it to be true and tried to borrow money at high interest rates to redeem their pledges. As of about 5:00 PM that evening, the pawnshop was still crowded. The pawnshop staff were extremely busy, allowing redemptions on arrival. Afterwards, they sent a letter to the county Chamber of Commerce to submit to the county government to investigate and arrest the rumor-mongering villains and to issue a notice to clarify the situation to prevent trouble from arising.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Collapse at Liuwei River Mouth</p>
<p>The Liuwei River mouth section of the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Motorized Military Road collapses many times every year. The collapses mostly occur during the summer and autumn when the river tide is high. Over the past decade, more than two English miles have been lost. It was previously discussed to follow the example of Nantong Tianshengang, organize a collapse prevention committee, and request appropriations from the central and provincial authorities to build water dikes to ensure that collapses do not continue to occur. However, the funds required are enormous and the work is difficult, making it impossible to accomplish in a short period of time. Unexpectedly, during the continuous moldy rainy season, the river tide rose, and the southeast wind blew strongly, causing severe erosion. On the night of the 27th, another ten or more zhang (a unit of length) of the Liuwei riverbank collapsed. All the houses at the river mouth were lost to the waves. Fortunately, there was a warning five minutes before the event, so no one was injured. On the morning of the 28th, land transportation between Zhenjiang and Yangzhou was completely cut off and did not resume until after 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Yuyao</h3>
<p>50,000 Mu of Early Rice Flooded</p>
<p>Since the beginning of summer, Yuyao has experienced continuous rain. The Yaojiang River has risen to a high level, and small floods have occurred. Low-lying areas in the suburbs have become marshes. 50,000 mu of early rice have been submerged, causing widespread panic among farmers who are reporting the disaster to the county government. The county government has dispatched personnel to investigate separately.</p>
<p>Measles Spreading in Nanlan Township</p>
<p>Recently, the Nanlan Township area has been affected by abnormal weather. Measles is spreading rapidly in various villages. The number of children who have died from the disease is nearly 130. The severity of the situation can be imagined, with Yazhuang and Shilin villages being the most affected. Deaths are still occurring. The county government has dispatched physician Yang Taiji to conduct an on-site inspection and find ways to prevent and control the disease.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Wheat Prices Soaring Unabated</p>
<p>Wheat prices in this county are soaring unabated. When it first entered the market, it was only over six yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). It then gradually increased, suddenly rising five jiao on the 26th. Now, No. 1 Huxi wheat has reached nine yuan and seven jiao per shi, and Huxi wheat has also reached eight yuan and nine jiao. This is because flour mills from various places and Gaoyou shops are competing to purchase it. In addition, the harvest in this county has declined due to the impact of spring rain. It is not difficult to break through the ten-yuan mark.</p>
<p>Slaughter Tax Collected by the Business Tax Bureau</p>
<p>From the 26th fiscal year (i.e., from July 1st), all slaughter taxes in this county will be collected by the Business Tax Bureau. All brokers must exchange their licenses within the specified period and must not apply early or falsely.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Completion of Canal Embankment Slope Reinforcement</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction has completed the east and west dike slope reinforcement project on the Liyun Canal. In addition to the Canal Works Bureau sending personnel to inspect and accept each section, the Provincial Department of Construction has also requested the bureau to send personnel to inspect and complete the acceptance.</p>
<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Reality of the Yunnan Opium Ban</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>Yunnan has always been known for its beautiful climate, so its products are extremely abundant. According to the Director of the Department of Construction, Zhang Banghan, the quality of various products is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>Yunnan is the richest in mineral resources, especially coal and iron. Almost all 130 counties and bureaus in the province produce coal and iron. In remote areas, there is even more. Iron ore is occasionally mined, but coal is abundant because the forest resources are vast and inexhaustible. Even if the coal seams are naturally exposed, few people pay attention to them. Other minerals such as tin in Gejiu, copper in Huize Qiaojia, silver in Ludian Shuangbai, antimony in Wenshan Pingyi, and arsenic in Menghua Fengyi have all been mined effectively. As for sulfur, nickel, gold, lead, zinc, and cobalt (one of the metallic chemical elements, as hard as nickel, blue-white in color with a slight red tint, extremely expensive, so it is rarely used in industry, only the lead powder made from its oxides has bright colors and is mostly used as pigments), there are also many producing areas. The output of each ore, except for tin in Gejiu, which has a long history of taxation and knows its annual output of six to seven thousand tons, is mostly mined by local methods, with simple scales and irregular mining. There are no investigated figures. There are also marble, crystal, cotton, gypsum, clay, alum, talc, natural alkali, and pigment stone, whose production is also uncertain.</p>
<p>Yunnan has more than 10 million mu of natural forests, producing pine, fir, cypress, chestnut and other timbers of inexhaustible benefit. Forest products for edible, medicinal, and industrial uses are also extremely abundant, such as tea, purple stems, camphor, sapium sebiferum, lacquer trees, tung trees, cotton, chestnuts, pine nuts, walnuts, ginkgo, longan, lychee, wood ear, mushrooms, bamboo shoots, bamboo ginseng, poria cocos, cordyceps, colored kapok (produced in Baniu Village, Mojiang County, with red, blue, and black colors, more vibrant than cotton thread sold on the market, but only a few trees, now trying to plant more), sanqi (perennial herb, externally applied to stop bleeding and reduce swelling, internally taken as a warm tonic), chicken fir mushrooms (a special product of Yunnan, more delicious than "MSG," Emperor Xizong of the Ming Dynasty loved this dish and set up a special post station to buy it to Beijing, only produced in a few counties such as Menghua and Chongming), tiger paw mushrooms (more expensive than chicken fir mushrooms, used in Yunnan's high-end banquets), as well as dozens of special medicinal materials such as cinnamon, whose annual production and sales are considerable.</p>
<p>In the past, the farmers of this province planted a lot of opium, but now they are determined to completely ban planting within this year, even if it affects the province's tax revenue, they will not hesitate. The province's revenue from this item is more than one million yuan in national currency per year, and there is a considerable certainty of how to make up for this. However, the economic losses of the people are very problematic, because the province's opium production reaches more than 40 million taels per year. Aside from the province consuming half of it, the remaining 20 million taels are transported elsewhere, which can be exchanged for at least 20 million yuan in national currency. Now that it is resolutely banned, the economic losses should be compensated for by other means. Opium is related to the value of Yunnan's import and export goods, which is very significant. The major import goods in Yunnan over the years, cotton banknotes and cloths, are worth about 20 million yuan in national currency; silks, satins, silk floss, medicinal materials, cosmetics and other sundries are worth about 10 million yuan, totaling 30 to 40 million yuan. As for export goods, tin ore is worth 17 to 22 million yuan, and mountain goods and medicinal materials are worth about 4.5 million yuan, totaling 23 to 4 million yuan. Before the opium ban, imports exceeded exports by more than 10 to 20 million yuan each year. After opium was replanted, this huge deficit was not only offset, but at times it even appeared to be a surplus. (According to the Yunnan Economic Commission, Yunnan's previous imports exceeded exports by about 2 million taels per year. Since 1931, it has become a surplus, reaching more than 11 million yuan in national currency by 1935.) Therefore, the old Yunnan currency, which was gradually declining, was able to maintain a relatively stable position due to the nourishment of opium. The deep relationship between opium and Yunnan's economy and finance is evident. Therefore, the opium ban compensation plan should first make the price of import and export goods balanced in a considerable period. However, among the current export goods, mountain goods and medicinal materials do not sell well abroad. Fortunately, tin ore can be exported in large quantities, so efforts should be made to increase its production as soon as possible. Other minerals such as tungsten, antimony, asbestos, and mica should also be actively mined to meet market demand.</p>
<p>Provincial Chairman Long Yun has also made some statements regarding the opium ban. He said, "After the opium ban, revenue has sharply declined. In the midst of extreme difficulties, we have prepared a compensation plan. Most of the mountain fields where opium was planted can be used to grow winter crops. As for other suitable plants, tung and cotton are the most important. Tung oil is an important export commodity in this province. We have designated 57 counties such as Yuanmou as tung planting areas. Each county has purchased 500 jin of seeds each autumn to sow. To promote cotton planting, we have purchased 30,000 jin of seeds from the National Economic Commission and distributed them to various official cotton areas for planting experiments. In addition, we have opened a machine spinning and weaving factory outside the South Gate of Kunming to use cotton grown in this province as raw material." Regarding the overall opium ban situation in the province, after the provincial government decided on a "three-year ban" policy and strictly implemented it starting in 1935, 85 cities and counties have completely eradicated opium cultivation. The remaining 44 counties that are strictly enforcing the ban will also be completely cleared by the deadline this year. Regarding the ban on smoking, there are 176,112 registered smokers in the province. Currently, there are many smokers undergoing opium detoxication at the Opium Detoxication Hospital in Kunming.</p>

<h3>Kawagoe, Carrying New Instructions from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Okamoto Held a Dinner Party That Evening and Convened a Meeting; They Agreed to Visit Xu Shiying for Talks This Afternoon; The Dates for Going to Beijing, Heading North, and Going to Lushan Have Not Been Determined</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru, carrying new instructions from his Ministry of Foreign Affairs, came to China to return to his post. He arrived in Shanghai at 4:00 PM yesterday on the Japanese postal ship Asama Maru. Only Secretary Hoshida accompanied him; his family did not come. The ship berthed at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu. At the time, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces and detectives from the concession police station were heavily guarded. Those who went to the ship to welcome him included Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Shiying, Wang Changchun representing Acting Mayor Yu Hongjun, Zhou Jue, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Pengsheng, Treaty Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Huang Bode, Hu Mai, secretaries of the Embassy in Japan, and Kamimura, Chief of the First Section of the East Asia Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who came to Shanghai to meet him, Japanese Embassy Councilor and Consul General in Beijing Hidaka, Okamoto, Special Commissioner and Consul General in Shanghai, Shimizu, Chinese Counselor, Izumin, Director of the Information Department and Consul in Shanghai, Kicchu, Consul, Soya, Secretary, Kita, Military Attaché, Utsunomiya, Assistant Military Attaché, Honda, Naval Attaché, Okino, Assistant Naval Attaché, Kanoh, President of the Japanese Residents' Association, and Japanese leaders such as Funatsu, Buhe, and Yamamoto, totaling over a hundred people. After Kawagoe exchanged greetings with the welcoming personnel on the ship, he declared that he was tired from the voyage and not feeling well. He went ashore and drove directly back to his residence on Bith Road. When the Chinese press corps met him on the ship and repeatedly requested an interview, he was ultimately refused. At 7:00 PM that evening, Consul General Okamoto in Shanghai hosted a dinner party for Kawagoe at his residence on Seymour Road to welcome him. All of Kamimura, Hidaka, Tajiri, Shimizu, etc. were invited to participate. A meeting was held on the spot. Kawagoe explained the process of returning to the country to seek instructions and the content of the new instructions. Hidaka and Okamoto reported on the general situation in China. Kamimura and Tajiri reported on their visit to North China. Kawagoe continued to summon Military Attaché Kita and Naval Attaché Hirata to discuss everything until late at night before dispersing. According to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, Kawagoe had agreed with Xu Shiying to visit Xu at 3:00 PM this afternoon. Xu told a reporter from the New Sound News Agency yesterday that the meeting with Kawagoe would be a private conversation and not a diplomatic negotiation. Earlier, when Xu greeted Kawagoe on the ship yesterday, Kawagoe first conveyed greetings from his new Prime Minister Konoe to Xu, saying that both the Japanese government and the public hoped that Ambassador Xu would return to his post soon. According to Shimizu, Chinese Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, Kawagoe will stay in Shanghai for several days before going to Beijing. However, it is heard that Foreign Minister Wang has decided to go to Lushan on the 2nd of next month, so he may not be able to meet him. The date for going to North China and Lushan has not been determined. The Japanese Embassy has rented a house in Lushan because the various ministries of the Executive Yuan of your country move to Lushan for the summer, in order to facilitate the contact business. In the future, they will send personnel there in rotation, but it is not a formal branch of the embassy.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, observers of the current situation said that this return to his post by Ambassador Kawagoe may not be able to smoothly unfold the stalemate in Sino-Japanese diplomacy. This is because the negotiations that Kawagoe came to prepare for are only the so-called adjustments to trade, aviation, and the tariff system. Japan is unwilling to discuss the various issues in eastern Hebei and northern Chahar that China hopes to resolve. This can be proven by the remarks made by Ambassador Kawagoe to newspaper reporters in Tokyo before returning to his post. Therefore, the hope that the Sino-Japanese issue can be smoothly unfolded after this return to his post by Ambassador Kawagoe seems very slim.</p>
<p>According to the Dōmei News Agency, Ambassador Kawagoe, who had been in his country for about a month, arrived in Shanghai on the Asama Maru at 4:00 PM on the 29th to return to his post. He stated, "I heard that the Chinese side has regarded the remarks I made when I set sail from Yokohama as a problem. I think there is no lack of misunderstanding in it. What I felt deeply when I returned to my country this time was that China has gradually progressed to a modern country by modeling Japan's development, and this has become common sense among the Japanese intellectual class. The so-called re-understanding of China has also been fully popularized, and everything in Japan has continued to progress. I would like to ask people from all walks of life in China to fully recognize this. As for economic cooperation in North China, I will assist in various issues that are beneficial to China and do not harm Japan. This is our new hope. If it can be handled by discussing it with the local authorities, we will promote negotiations with the local authorities. When it is necessary to negotiate with the central government, we should consult with the central government. As for the so-called political adjustment of diplomatic relations, it is difficult to regard the atmosphere between the two countries today as appropriate. If the atmosphere between the two countries becomes good, it is by no means impossible to adjust Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. I firmly believe that there will be such a time in the future. It is the duty of politicians of both countries to make the atmosphere between the two countries good, so I hope that both countries will continue to make efforts. It is also expected that friction may occur in the development paths of China and Japan, but I believe that both China and Japan do not want to fight, so preventing problems before they happen is the task of politicians and diplomats of both countries. The Anglo-Japanese talks are about to begin, but they have not reached a specific stage. The Chinese issue should be included, but it has not been decided in what form. I plan to stay in Shanghai for two or three days and then go to Nanjing. I heard that Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui is scheduled to go to Lushan on the 2nd, so it may not be convenient to meet. However, there is no urgent matter at present, and there is no need to rush to talk. There is a villa for the embassy in Lushan. If there is an important matter, I will go up the mountain, but I do not plan to live there now. I plan to go to North China around July 10, but not specifically to promote economic cooperation. As for economic cooperation, what should be started with? People there know all these kinds of issues very well. I am only discussing with them."</p>

<h3>Yang Hucheng Sailed Abroad Yesterday on a Mission</h3>
<p>First to the US, then to England, Germany, France, Italy, Denmark, and other countries for over a year to study military, agricultural, and industrial affairs</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Hucheng, former Director of Pacification in Shaanxi, was ordered by the Military Affairs Commission to go abroad for inspection. Yesterday afternoon, he departed with his secretary Wang Linge, Yuan Weike, staff officer Fan Yunong, and Mrs. Yang and their son, a total of six people, aboard the Dollar Steamship Line's President Hoover. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Departure Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Mr. Yang, accompanied by his family and well-wishers, boarded two small ferries, Yue Bao and Zhong Hui, at 9:30 AM yesterday to cross the river and board the President Hoover. The ship set sail for the US at 11:00 AM. Those who went to the ship to see him off included Wang Luyi, representative of Control Yuan President Yu Youren; Li Hongwen, representative of Military Affairs Commission Vice-Chairman Yan Xishan; Yang Hu, Garrison Commander of Shanghai and Woosung; Wang Shaozhai, representative of Acting Mayor Yu; Du Bincheng, representative of Shaanxi Provincial Government Chairman Sun Weiru; Xue Xiudong, representative of 17th Route Army Commander Feng Qinzai; Deng Baoshan, Commander of the Provisional 1st Army; Li Zhigang and Han Weixi, members of the Shaanxi Provincial Government; Yan Zhuang, Supervisor of the Control Yuan; Zhang Youlun, also of the Control Yuan; Zhao Shoushan, Commander of the 17th Division; Wang Zhuoran, President of Northeastern University; Li Huchen, Advisor to the Military Affairs Commission; and Zhang Xiaolin, Mrs. Du Yuesheng, Wang Zhinan, Zheng Boqi, and former subordinates of Mr. Yang, totaling over 60 people.

I plan to stay in the US for two months, first to inspect agriculture in the provinces of North America, and then to New York and Washington to inspect military and political affairs. Then I will cross the Atlantic to the United States and go to European countries such as Germany, France, Italy, and Denmark for inspection. As for whether I should return via the Soviet Union or through the Suez Canal, it is yet to be decided.

<h3>Shi Zhaoji's Speech on Good Neighbor Policy at the Annual Meeting of the American Alumni Association Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fear is the most despicable psychology of mankind. I hope Japan will eventually realize this sooner or later.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Alumni Association of American Universities held its annual meeting at the American Club on Fuzhou Road yesterday (29th) at 12:00 noon. Representatives from various universities, including Hill Meek, Dang Lanya, Li Zhaohuan, Po Fook Keung, Chen Jintao, Hu Yizhang, Wang Yukai, Chuan Ruoyu, Xu Shaoming, and others, totaling about 200 people, attended. First, Chairman Hill Meek delivered an opening speech and reported on the association's affairs over the past year. Next, the treasurer reported on the association's financial situation over the past year. Then, the chairman was re-elected, and Yan Fuqing was elected as the chairman for the next year. Finally, former Ambassador to the United States Dr. Shi Zhaoji gave a speech entitled "Good Neighbor Policy." The original text is as follows: Today, when I speak to you about the good neighbor issue, I can't help but recall General Smuts of South Africa's remarks on the European situation. He believed that the tension between European countries was largely due to mutual fear. He said that the relationship between European countries today can be said to be completely driven by fear. Fear is the most despicable psychology of mankind, and today it controls the people of all Europe. Looking at the recent aggressive expansion of armaments by European countries, with swords drawn, there is a sense of precariousness, which is very different from the impression I got in the United States. The relationship between the countries of the Americas is getting better and better, especially the relationship between the people of South and Central America and the people of the United States. This has to be praised for the efforts of the United States to promote good relations. The governments and people of the Americas have always been deeply suspicious of the international policies of the United States. The United States has successively annexed Bao Geli Ge, interfered in Cuba's sovereignty, ruled the Panama Canal area, and its troops occupied countries such as Haiti, Santo Domingo, and Nicaragua, issuing orders without hesitation. All of these things cannot but make people suspect that the United States has no ambition to invade, and even express hatred for the Monroe Doctrine. Although this doctrine is ostensibly aimed at defending against foreign aggression and interference, it is actually a tool for the United States to dominate the weak, and because the United States has repeatedly stated that the United States is the sole responsible party for the Monroe Doctrine, and its scope and application are generally stipulated and presided over by the United States, it has aroused resentment. In recent years, the United States government has made great efforts to promote a good neighbor policy, not only in words but also in deeds, and has earnestly implemented it in both economic and political aspects. Therefore, the fear and suspicion of the weak countries of the Americas in the past has been largely eliminated. From a passive point of view, what this good neighbor policy shows is a declaration that no matter what happens in the future, it will never send troops to invade neighboring countries, and will withdraw troops originally stationed in South and Central American countries, and re-sign treaties with Cuba and Panama to adjust relations. On the active side, it is to sign reciprocal trade agreements with neighboring countries. At the opening of the American Peace Conference last December, President Roosevelt said in his speech on the United States' non-interference in the politics of other American countries: "We will never tolerate any aggressive acts. The people of the Americas and Canada have no ambition to invade, nor do they want to be invaded. We will cooperate with each other on the principles of freedom and equality to promote culture. This goal can be achieved by concluding friendship treaties." The reason why I quote the good neighbor policy of the United States is that I firmly believe that international relations can be adjusted and improved by an enlightened policy that combines words and deeds. At present, there is said to be no mutual suspicion between the countries of the Americas. Now that the relationship between the United States and other countries in the Americas is as described above, let me talk more about the relationship between Canada and the United States. The borders of the two countries are interconnected, but Canada has never had any fear of being invaded. However, the interests of the two countries are not completely the same, and conflicts have often occurred in the past, and sometimes the situation is quite serious, such as the war between Britain and the United States in 1812, when American troops invaded Canada twice, and the dispute between Maine and New Brunswick over the border, as well as the dispute over the Oregon border, the dispute over the Alaska border, and the Caroline affair (Canadian troops bombed and sank a ship in American waters). The people of the two countries also hated each other for fishing and otter hunting. Even today, Canada's commercial policy, which was decided at the Ottawa Imperial Conference, is considered unfavorable by the American business community, and the American tariff policy is also deeply dissatisfied with by Canadians. However, the Canadian people deeply believe that the United States has no intention of using force to oppress them. Although the border between the two countries is long, there are no troops stationed there. One hundred and twenty years ago, the two countries signed a treaty that they would never operate warships in the Great Lakes. The governments of the two countries have adhered to this agreement to this day. Therefore, in the relationship between Canada and the United States, there is no fear psychology that General Smuts spoke of. From the past and present mutual relations of the countries of the Americas, it can be seen that if countries can cooperate peacefully and sincerely with each other, all problems can be solved. There are many large and small countries in the Americas, and there is a large country standing among them. It is easy for bullying the weak to occur, but if the large country can implement a good neighbor policy, it can dispel the fears of the countries. What I have said above is not intended to praise the United States, but to make people realize that what can be implemented in the Western Hemisphere, why can't other countries imitate it, eliminate international fear and suspicion, and cooperate sincerely to ascend to the realm of world peace together. The above-mentioned points should be of concern to the people of East Asia. It goes without saying that the current Sino-Japanese relations need to be improved. We have always admired our Eastern neighbor's efforts to govern the country. Decades ago, Japan was still in the feudal era. With the advocacy of a group of enlightened people, it absorbed Western material civilization and leaped to become a modern industrial country. However, the great development of our country's millennia-old culture depends on its own people and its own talents. Stimson said that China cannot be controlled or driven by external forces. Its deep-rooted culture, with more than 4,000 years of history, can serve as proof, and its love of peace is a guarantee of peace in East Asia. I share the same hope as Stimson, which is that sooner or later Japan will eventually realize this. Japan's commercial and political relations are most closely related to China. To seek permanent benefits, it must use friendly and peaceful means. Military aggression cannot solve the problem. Once the suspicion between China and Japan is eliminated, and the good neighbor policy first implemented on the east coast of the Pacific Ocean can be promoted on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, it will open a new era in modern history, and it should be a matter of rejoicing and encouragement for the people of China, Japan, and the United States. Now I quote Stimson's words in his book "The Crisis in the Far East" to end. He said that all major problems of mankind can eventually be solved, but the solution should be based on the efforts of the sages of the past to show to future generations. Our only duty is to have firm faith and courageous spirit, and to make this transition period and this period of doubt as short and wonderful as possible, so as not to cause unexpected branches.</p>

<h3>The Banking Association Held Its 12th Annual General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Report on the Handling of Association Affairs in the First Half of This Year; Approved the Membership of Zhengming, Zhonghe, and Other Three Banks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association held its 12th Annual General Meeting at its office on Hong Kong Road yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. The meeting reported on the association's affairs in the first half of the year, approved the membership of Zhengming and other three banks, the replacement of representatives of nine banks including Dongya, and the final accounts of the previous term and the budget for the next term. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Representatives</p>
<p>Representatives from 43 institutions including China, Communications, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Shiye, China Farmers, Shanghai Jianye, Zhongfu, Juxingcheng, Siming, Zhonghua, Jincheng, Xinhua, Dalu, Dongya Yongheng, China Shiye, China Tongshang, Zhongnan, Jiangsu, Guohua, Chouye, etc., including Li Fusun, Hu Bijiang, Yuan Songsun, Qu Jigang, Wu Yunsu, Zhu Runsheng, Liu Pinsan, Yang Jiemei, Wang Zhixin, Tang Shoumin, Song Ziliang, Zhou Zuomin, Du Yuesheng, Xu Xinliu, Wang Yansong, Wang Boyuan, Sun Jingxi, Wang Shaoxian, Zhu Zikui, Hu Meian, Xu Yitang, Yu Shouchun, Liu Hongyuan, etc., totaling 101 people. Secretary-General Lin Kanghou and Secretary Gu Chengan attended as observers.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Wu Yunqi reported on the handling of the association's affairs in the first half of the year, saying, "Today is the date of the 12th Annual General Meeting of our association. Looking back, it has been almost six years since our establishment. These short six years have been the period with the most reforms in the country's economic policy. Starting with the abolition of taels and the use of yuan, including the promulgation of the Savings Bank Law, the unification of domestic bonds, the implementation of legal tender, and the recent implementation of income tax, the new policies are all closely related to the financial industry. The tasks are complex and the responsibilities are heavy, far different from the past. Fortunately, more and more colleagues from the industry have joined the association, which has invisibly increased the strength of our association. All the measures have gradually become sound. My colleagues in the association are deeply cautious about their duties. I hope that my colleagues present will provide guidance based on their observations. It is my great fortune. I will briefly describe the progress in the past six months as follows, and I ask the members present to observe it. The previous term's association affairs report only briefly mentioned the implementation of income tax. Now half a year has passed, and judging from the association's experience, it is the most complicated work in recent years. Income tax itself is related to the entire people, which cannot be compared with other taxes with a narrow scope. The banking industry not only needs to study the tax payment methods of its own industry, but also needs to fulfill the obligation of withholding taxes. At the beginning of the establishment, there was no basis to rely on. Although there were regulations, implementation rules, and various types of collection guidelines, the clues were complicated and the matter was not one-sided. It was difficult to drive the pen and the road was full of difficulties. The association deeply knows the close relationship of this matter, and entrusted the Banking Association to conduct preliminary research. During the winter of last year, it recommended the organization of an income tax working group of the fifteen banks in China to prepare everything. At that time, the Money Industry Association immediately appointed representatives to participate in the cooperation. The most difficult thing to handle when the tax was implemented was the third category of income tax on deposit interest. It was originally scheduled to be levied in October 25th. The association, considering that preparation took time and the procedures were rushed, reported to the Ministry of Finance for approval to postpone it to this year. The working group began to study it step by step. In the past six months, a total of fourteen meetings have been held, each lasting more than three or four hours. Other personal contacts and repeated discussions are more than that. The working group's work steps are to look at the urgency and prioritize them. First, the regulations, implementation rules, and various types of collection guidelines are studied in turn. The doubts about the regulations and implementation rules are related to legislation, and the opinions are drafted and sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to be submitted for modification. Other questions on collection are directly sent to the Income Tax Affairs Office for explanation, often to the second or third time, and it must be thoroughly understood before it is completed. In the meantime, some have been adopted and modified, or there are still some to be considered. The accumulation of volumes is full of feet, and there are still internal procedures of the industry. The surface seems to have nothing to do with the tax law, but in fact there are chain relationships. We have also formulated methods for consideration as far as possible. Together with all the solutions in the past, they have been successively notified to members and local associations, so that they know what to rely on. In the end, at the beginning of the establishment, there was not enough preparation, and the laws and regulations have also been changed. Therefore, in addition to the meeting minutes, there are still many outstanding cases, and it is difficult to have a consistent narrative for the time being. In total, with fourteen discussions and six months of contact, the work is not even half done. It can be seen how trivial it is, and the income tax on profit-making enterprises has not yet begun to be levied. The procedures are even more complicated. There is more work to be done by the working group. After the end of this year, the research will also have some clues. It should be compiled and printed as a special publication for reference. During the study of income tax, there was also a motive for levying inheritance tax. The Legislative Yuan sent the principles and draft regulations of the tax to the association, and asked for opinions. Although this case is not as important as income tax, it should also be considered. Therefore, it was handed over to the income tax working group for discussion. The most important opinion was to divide the principles of the tax into two types: gross inheritance tax and split inheritance tax. Because the relationship between relatives is close and distant, the tax payment should also be different, so as to show fairness and to be submitted to the Executive Committee for review and discussion, and to solicit the opinions of the banks present. It was just sorted out a few days ago and sent to the Legislative Yuan for selection. As for cases that are continuous with the previous term, such as the donation for the purchase of aircraft for birthday celebration, the banks in the association initially jointly recognized 10,000 yuan. Later, the actual number solicited in Shanghai was compared with the planned donation amount, and the difference was still large. The association, loving the country and not daring to lag behind, relied on the enthusiastic contribution of the banks present and continued to recognize the donation of 110,000 yuan, which has been paid in full. It is heard that the government will reward them separately in accordance with the regulations. The donation for the same nature of the Japan Sports Movement also reached more than 9,000 yuan, all of which was the salary income of the colleagues in each bank for one day, and was also submitted to the municipal government for collection and transfer. The case has been closed and is hereby reported so that all members know the beginning and end, etc., etc."</p>
<p>Approved Various Cases</p>
<p>After the chairman's report, the discussion began: ㊀ Approved Zhengming, Shanghai City, Zhonghe, and other three banks to apply to join the association as members. ㊁ Approved Dongya, Siming, Communications, China Farmers, Kenye, China Shiye, Tongshang, Nongshang, Guangdong, and other nine banks to request the replacement of member representatives. ㊂ Approved the final accounts of the first half of this year. ㊃ Approved the budget for the second half of this year. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Eurasia Company's Ping-Hong Kong Route Flew Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Jingcong Flew to Hong Kong to Preside</p>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Ping-Hong Kong route, after more than a month of preparation, was launched yesterday (29th). The route is a gradual resumption of the Ping-Guangdong route and has been approved by the Hong Kong authorities to extend to the island to connect with the Far East routes of Britain and the United States. At the beginning of the launch, there are two round trips per week, flying south on Thursdays and returning north on Fridays, arriving on the same day. On the first flight yesterday, Li Jingcong, General Manager of the company, and his wife, Huo Erz, Director of the Air Navigation Group, Wu Dong, reporter from the Central News Agency, and a reporter from Reuters, a group of five people, flew from Shanghai to Hankou at 7:10 AM yesterday to transfer to the plane from Ping to Hong Kong.

Yesterday's first flight, the connection in Hankou was an exception.</p>
<h3>Compilation of Disaster Relief Efforts from Various Sources</h3>
<p>Jin Relief Association Hosts Press</p>
<p>Shanxi Hedong Relief Association representatives Zhu Enrong and Luo Zengshou, came to Shanghai from Beijing seeking relief funds, having already spent ten days. Except for Zhu, who urgently needed to discuss relief funds with the Central Relief Committee and had already left for Beijing a few days ago, Luo hosted a reception for the press and fellow Shanxi natives in Shanghai at the YMCA on Ba Xian Qiao Road at 5 PM yesterday. He reported on the disaster situation in southern Shanxi and the efforts to seek relief funds from various parties in Beijing and Shanghai. He stated that the drought-stricken area in southern Shanxi covers a total of sixteen counties, with an estimated affected population of over 800,000. The most severely affected counties include Pinglu, Ruicheng, Yongji, Yuanqu, Linfen, Yuxiang, Anyi, and Jiexian. The affected counties have organized the Hedong Relief Association, requesting investigation and relief from the provincial government on one hand, and recommending representatives to appeal to the Central Government and various circles in Shanghai on the other. Fortunately, considerable results have been achieved. The central government will allocate 100,000 from the Ministry of Finance for relief first. In Shanghai, an agreement has been reached with the Joint Disaster Relief Association of various charitable organizations to handle the Shanxi disaster in a coordinated manner with Sichuan, Guizhou, and Henan provinces.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Radio Officers Request Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>All Radio Officers of the State-Run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Request that the Meager Salaries They Receive, Which Were Set More Than Ten Years Ago, Are Difficult to Maintain in Modern Life, and Because the Work They Perform Is Solely Responsible and Their Responsibilities and Duties Are Comparable to Those of Other Senior Crew Members, While Their Treatment Differs Greatly. While Deck and Engine Room Personnel Can Be Promoted and Receive Salary Increases, Radio Officers Have No Possibility of Promotion or Hope of Salary Increase, Remaining Unchanged for Years. Moreover, the Company Requires Radio Officers to Possess a Ship Radio Officer License Issued by the Ministry of Communications, Making Them More Qualified Than Those Who Lack Qualifications. As Qualifications Are Restricted and Work Is More Demanding Than Any Other Vessel, Successive General Managers Have Been Repeatedly Requested, and Because There Were Sufficient Reasons, They All Agreed, but Due to the Poor Market and Poor Business over the Years, Although Improvement Was Permitted or Regulations Had Been Drafted, Implementation Was Not Demonstrated. Now That the Market Has Become Prosperous Again, and the Company's Business Is Extremely Developed, the Previous So-Called Helplessness Has Now Been Defeated. Furthermore, Since the Incumbent General Manager Cai Took Office, He Has Actively Improved All Aspects and Is Always Eager to Improve.

<h3>Pudong Bank to Expand Pudong Agricultural Loans Next Month</h3>
<p>Loan Amount Set at One Million Yuan Warehouses to Be Built in Xinchang and Other Places</p>
<p>The Pudong area is vast and rich in agricultural products. In the past, Pudong Bank has handled agricultural loans to help farmers avoid manipulation by merchants, such as price reductions and devaluations. Since the implementation of these agricultural loans, farmers have found it convenient. Recently, the Pudong gentry and businessmen have requested Pudong Bank to expand agricultural lending. The bank has cooperated with the Farmers Bank of China to handle this, and it can be implemented starting next month. Pudong Bank originally had two warehouses in Zhoupu, Pudong. Now, four new warehouses are being built in Xinchang, Datuan, Qingcun Port, and Gexing. The two banks have sent personnel to the above locations to survey the warehouse locations, and the warehouse styles have also been drafted. Construction can begin the day after tomorrow and must be completed before the autumn harvest. In the future, a joint warehouse will be established. The loan amount for the two banks this autumn has been set at 600,000 yuan from the Farmers Bank of China and 400,000 yuan from Pudong Bank, totaling 1,000,000 yuan. If necessary, the loan amount will be gradually increased.</p>
<h3>British Shipping Company Crew Members Improve Treatment</h3>
<p>Successfully Resolved</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that, according to Mr. Watson, joint secretary of the Chinese Seamen's Association and the Chinese Maritime Pilots' Association, the crew members of the Chinese coastal shipping companies requested improved treatment, and negotiations with Jardine Matheson and Swire have been going on for about six months, and now the goal has been achieved. It is heard that Jardine Matheson will no longer calculate the conversion of Chinese currency by converting to local currency, resulting in great losses to the deck and engine room crew members. In the future, it will be settled according to the market. In the past, Swire crew members' salaries were settled according to the market, and the rest was paid in Chinese currency. This system has also changed. It is heard that in the future, all will be paid in Chinese currency, which is equivalent to increasing salaries by more than 10%. In addition to increasing salaries, Jardine Matheson also promised to pay a maintenance fee of five years for those who have wives after the death of employees. Swire has been saving up for employee maintenance fees for six or seven years. Other companies, such as the Great Eastern Company, also have salary increases. However, British and other foreign crew members hired by Chinese shipping companies in Shanghai and other places are of course not related to this new change.</p>
<h3>Navigation Bureau Instructs Two Companies to Replace Ningbo Ship Captains</h3>
<p>Before the Two Captains Are Reassigned, Xinjiangtian and Ningxing Are Allowed to Sail</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ningbo Line's Xin Jiangtian Wheel and Sanbei Company's Ningxing Wheel collided in Zhenhai, and the two captains each refused to admit their mistakes. The Ministry of Communications has telegraphed the Shanghai Navigation Bureau to investigate strictly. The Navigation Bureau dismissed Xin Jiangtian Captain Yang Honglin and Ningxing Captain Pan Erxun at the same time last Saturday, and wanted to detain the two shipowners, and ordered the two companies not to be allowed to sail without replacing the new captain. Later, after the company requested another voyage, the Navigation Bureau agreed. Until yesterday, the two ships returned to Shanghai. The China Merchants and Sanbei companies were unable to delay the departure of the Ningbo wheel due to the incident. Now, an excellent captain has not been found for a while, and he is currently being searched for. Before a new captain has been found, may the Navigation Bureau be requested to approve and temporarily allow the two shipowners to maintain normal navigation? After consultation, the Navigation Bureau agreed to do so, but ordered the two companies to find and hire a new shipowner as soon as possible, so Xin Jiangtian and Ningxing were still able to sail yesterday.</p>
<h3>Various Places Have Responded to Not Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods</h3>
<p>Xiamen Minnan Will Continue to Establish Please Send Regulations for Participation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Committee for Not Buying or Selling Smuggled Goods received letters from various places yesterday, expressing the Ning Should Resist Smuggling Movement. The original letter from the Xiamen City Party Department reads, since the prevalence of smuggling through secret channels has affected our people's livelihood and national foundation to a great extent, if we do not seek remedy urgently, we will inevitably plunge the country and government into bankruptcy. Your association has foresight, and in order to assist the government in stopping smuggling, you have promoted the anti-smuggling movement, and since its import, it has achieved remarkable results, which is admirable. This city is a town in South China, and should promote this movement to curb the root of smuggling. However, its implementation methods lack reference materials. Your association has been established for a long time, and each work plan has been carefully formulated. I dare to send a letter requesting investigation and immediate sending of a copy of the implementation methods, regulations, and other plans for reference, and I learned that the Wu County Federation of Trade Unions and Pingnan County have sent letters to the association expressing their response.</p>

<h3>Old Incident Twelve Years Ago Li Guojun's Son Was Kidnapped and the Contact Was Assassinated</h3>
<p>Leaving Behind a Widow and an Orphan, the Li Family Has Not Provided Relief Chen Tao Is Now Suing the Court for a Pension</p>
<p>Li Shiquan, son of Li Guojun, former Guangdong Provincial Judge, grandson of Li Hongzhang, a high-ranking official of the late Qing Dynasty, currently residing at No. 3, Shanzhong Lane, Puzhong Road, French Concession, was kidnapped on December 29, 1925, when he lived at No. 4, New Chongqing Road, Public Concession. The kidnappers demanded a ransom of 100,000 yuan. At that time, Li's father, Guojun, entrusted his friend Chen Tao, a graduate of law and former county magistrate, to go to Nanjing with Liu Lushan, a bodyguard from the same place, to negotiate the ransom. Who knew that Chen and Liu were going to be jealous, so on January 9, 1926, Chen and Liu were successively assassinated by kidnappers in the Chinese territory of Luban Road and Xieshi Road. Chen's death left behind a widow, Tao, who is now 59 years old, and an orphan, Xiaonian, who is now 28 years old. At that time, Tao was heartbroken by the tragic death of her husband and suffered a mental breakdown. Coupled with the fact that the orphan was young and ignorant, she did not ask the Li family for compensation. However, Li Shiquan was eventually redeemed by his family, but the families of Chen Tao and Liu Lushan, who were killed by the kidnappers for negotiating the ransom for him, never received proper treatment. Chen Tao has endured the pain for twelve years, suffering and raising her son Xiaonian to adulthood. Recently, Chen Tao and Chen Xiaonian, mother and son, grieved the tragic death of their husband and father, and the Li family turned a deaf ear to their plight, which was against morality, so they entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Court's Civil Division against Li Shiquan, requesting an order to pay a pension of 8,000 yuan. The case was heard twice by Judge Li Liang, but the defendant Li Youquan did not attend, and the date was changed. Yesterday morning, the hearing was continued, and the plaintiff and her lawyer attended the court to state everything. The defendant was represented by a Tang, who made a statement and defense. The court found that the case was clear and ordered the debate to be closed, and the judgment was set for the 30th.</p>

<h3>Chen Baoxiang Sentenced for Defrauding Female Guides of Ornaments</h3>
<p>It has been found that the suspect committed a total of nine offenses. He is sentenced to one year and two months imprisonment for habitual fraud.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a group of unemployed individuals who specialize in renting rooms in various hotels and hiring female guides to come to them, devising ways to deceive them out of their ornaments in order to pawn them for money. Although the police have cracked down on several such incidents, these events still occur from time to time due to the clever methods of the swindlers. Chen Baoxiang from Ningbo is one such person.

Later, as the plaintiff came and went, they gathered thousands of people and damaged the factory again. The Gordon Road Police dispatched a team to suppress the riot before it dispersed. Because the location was on a road built across the border, the District Court accepted the case. Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang investigated and prosecuted Xu Chan and the other thirteen defendants.

<h3>Selling Hand Looms by Mail to Collect Money from Other Places</h3>
<p>Reported by a customer, investigated by the court.</p>
<p>Li Nanying, the manager of the Tangshan Road Commercial Advertising Company, and Wu Jiqun, an employee of the company, learned that there was profit to be made from reselling the hand looms produced by the Zhonghua New Method Weaving Society. Therefore, they used the company's name to place advertisements in newspapers, claiming that Type A machines cost 160 yuan and could weave woolen sweaters and trousers. They solicited people to purchase by mail from other places, requiring a prepayment of four corners for postage and five yuan for the price, in order to defraud them of the price of the goods. Li Xiangquan from Anhui saw the advertisement and raised 5.40 yuan. On April 19th of this year, he mailed the money to the company from Guantian Town, Jiashan County, Anhui. However, Li and others did not send the machine. Li sent several letters to inquire, but they ignored them. Li then submitted the postal receipt to the Shanghai District Court to file a lawsuit. Prosecutor Lei Binzhang investigated and found the facts to be true, and prosecuted Li Nanying and Wu Jiqun under Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Judge Wang opened the trial yesterday. The defendant Li Nanying did not appear, and only Wu Jiqun appeared in court with his lawyer Cheng Zhengping. Wu Jiqun stated that he did not deny receiving the 5.40 yuan, but that the hand looms were being sold on behalf of the Zhonghua New Method Weaving Society. The original price of a Type A machine was 5 yuan, and the wholesale price was 3 yuan. They received his money on April 21st, but the company did not have any goods. At that time, the Zhonghua New Method Weaving Society was also out of stock. It was not until May 29th that they received the goods from the society and had already sent them out. The court concluded the debate and will announce the verdict on the 30th.</p>

<h3>Begging for Disaster Relief and Tea Parties</h3>
<p>— Wang Ruoying</p>
<p>This year's famine is not only extremely severe and tragic, but also covers a wide area, reaching as many as eight provinces. For example, in Shanxi, since the beginning of spring this year, the Hedong area in southern Shanxi has not had any rain, "the stored grain has long been eaten up, the new harvest is extremely poor, and cotton has not yet been planted." Compared with those who have no harvest at all, this situation is naturally a little better, but for those who are experiencing it, what unspeakable suffering it is!</p>
<p>Various forms of disaster relief movements are being carried out to save the suffering compatriots, which is naturally good. In order to allow the victims to survive at a minimum, the severity of the disaster is assessed to determine the order of urgency, which is also beyond reproach. However, the less severely affected areas should also be treated equally and provided with relief, which should not be forgotten. The reason why the disaster in Sichuan has become so severe is due to the lack of attention when it was less severe, and the fabrication of a false sense of peace. Moreover, the disaster in southern Shanxi is not light now.</p>
<p>Therefore, it is undoubtedly necessary to provide disaster relief to the Hedong area of southern Shanxi, and it is also appropriate to send representatives to the central government to beg for relief and to appeal to all parties. After begging for relief and appealing with results, I think they should return quickly. Not only should they return quickly to "handle association affairs," but also to console the long-awaited hopes of the disaster victims.</p>
<p>Before returning, while begging for relief and appealing, the representatives who speak for the victims should be frugal and thrifty everywhere, which I assume is a given. But I still cannot remain silent about tea party receptions.</p>
<p>When thinking of the tragic situation in the disaster area, we certainly don't need to be melodramatic and say things like "unable to swallow food," but based on human compassion, we cannot remain unmoved. Therefore, I believe that begging for relief and appealing, like "inviting the local press to a tea party to report on the progress of the negotiations with various parties," is unnecessary. The reason is simple: saving one penny is saving one penny, and "saving one more penny" is "saving one more life."</p>
<p>Naturally, if it is necessary to "report on the progress of the negotiations with various parties," it is necessary to invite the press or other relevant parties to the meeting. Is the report necessary? I am not familiar with the inside story and have never been a representative, so I don't know. Judging from the words, if it is only to report some progress and has no other purpose, then I think it is completely unnecessary. It is better to return as soon as possible, because the association affairs are urgently awaiting handling, and the victims are eagerly anticipating their return. If it is considered necessary to publicly report the "progress of the negotiations with various parties," then I think it is not necessary to have a "tea party." Finding a free place for everyone to talk is also possible, isn't it? The reason is still the same as above: saving one penny is saving one penny, and "saving one more penny" is "saving one more life." Especially since the organizers of this "tea party" are representatives who have come to beg for the victims, when they sit in front of a white table, smelling the aroma of coffee and refreshments, do they not feel unable to finish their meal when they think of the tragic situation in the disaster area?</p>
<p>If it is said that the convocation of this "tea party" was originally "for the sake of the invitees," then this is an underestimation of the "invitees." Because they have come to listen to the "report," they naturally have great sympathy for the victims; and those who come are not victims, and they will not come just to eat a few cakes and drink a cup of coffee.</p>
<h3>Old-Fashioned Landlord</h3>
<p>— Yegao</p>
<p>"Don't mind the dirt, sir! Here you can do what you want without women and children bothering you."</p>
<p>The one who said this was a short, old man in tattered clothes. After I explained my intention and rented his house at the highest price, he led me into a dimly lit room with only one skylight. Although it was winter, the house still reeked of a pungent musty smell.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>"This house hasn't been lived in for years..." I thought, but didn't say it. In fact, at this point, it was hard for me to express satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the house. Outside, snow was falling sparsely.</p>
<p>"What do you do?" He asked, sizing up my whole body and the hunting dog behind me.</p>
<p>"Can't you see: a hunter!" I said, pointing to the shotgun and the hunting dog, and was accepted.</p>
<p>"Are you suspicious? This house is lucky. My son and daughter-in-law used to live here..."</p>
<p>"No! I'm very satisfied," I said, and unloaded my things one by one.</p>
<p>In the evening, he occupied some wine and dishes from the small shop, and we sat facing each other in the house and drank. After drinking a few cups, the stern old man's face turned red, and his eyes were slightly drunk. He said a lot, starting with the season and the harvest, and then, in a sad tone, he spoke of himself:</p>
<p>"I, sir, am a worthless person. Except for those who want to harm me, no one respects me." He sighed sadly, "The farmers often scold me to my face: Uncle Gui Sheng, you are a miser, why aren't you ashamed? But why should I be ashamed? I live a good life. My son betrayed me. Three years ago, I got him a wife. Since then, they have been persecuting me together. When I'm not home, they search everywhere, break my door locks, and dig up the bricks under the ground. What for? Sir, think about it, just because they believe I have money hidden underground..."</p>
<p>"So you really hid money underground?" I asked with interest.</p>
<p>"Yes, but what does it matter to them? -- You old devil, we have no good food, no good clothes, but you hide a whole jar of silver underground, letting it rust and get moldy." They scolded me like this, but I ignored them. I believe that one day they will dig up all the foundations in my house, so when they were there, I didn't dare to go out of my room for a step. In the middle of the night, when they were all asleep, I would get up and count the silver. I was afraid that they would use magic to trick it away. Once when I was counting, I found that it had decreased. I believed that they had used magic to trick it away. I was very angry, so I drove them all out of this house..."</p>
<p>"Where are they now?" I called out curiously.</p>
<p>"Near the mountains in the village, sir. You will see them tomorrow when you go to the forest to hunt wild rabbits."</p>
<p>"Now you live alone in this big house?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I live alone. This way I can be much quieter. I can count silver during the day, and no one will hear it."</p>
<p>"Is that convenient?"</p>
<p>"Thank the Bodhisattva, everything is very good. You see, I'm not very old yet. I can still do things..."</p>
<p>After dinner, I retreated to my room. I prepared ammunition for a day of hunting in the forest tomorrow.</p>
<p>Snow was falling all over the mountains and fields. In front of the holy lamp, there was the old man's murmured prayer:</p>
<p>"Bless the old man, there is persecution everywhere!"</p>
<p>I wandered around the house in a daze.</p>
<h3>Sea Journey Notes (II)</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>A Group of Slaves to a Lost Country</p>
<p>Around seven o'clock, the reddish-brown sun hid in the west, the grey-blue sky reflected a dazzling red light, the sea breeze cooled down a bit, and the waves under the ship turned a lovely blue-green, the spray leaping like snow. There was no sound, nor a single star. The sky was dark. On the bow of the ship were three Vietnamese people. A man in his forties, since the ship was moored, he sat on the iron anchor reading. Next to him sat a woman wearing a wool coat, very young, and still a bit beautiful. She seemed to be looking at the distant horizon where the sea and sky meet. Sometimes the two of them would sigh softly. I guessed at their fate. Perhaps during the reign of the Nicholas Dynasty, they were the children of generals or counts. Now they are wandering to the East, consuming all their possessions in endless years. In order to withstand the irresistible hunger and cold, the man became a patrolman, bodyguard, or spy for the imperialists. The woman became a maid, dancer, and prostitute. With the arrival of summer, a group of aristocratic women selling their flesh would rush to Yantai to meet the Western sailors who wandered around the world. Now, with the accelerated "specialization" of Tianjin and Pingjin, a batch of White Russians raised by XX Japanese are pouring into North China, helping their shameless masters to arm and smuggle goods, or to run errands in drug dens and brothels.</p>
<p>Another short man, his mouth never leaving his pipe. He could speak a few incomplete Chinese words.</p>
<p>He leaned against the ship's railing until late at night, facing the sea breeze and smoking, always so melancholy.</p>
<p>The next afternoon, two guys in ill-fitting Western suits were speaking in a language I couldn't understand at all. They looked very much like Chinese, but the language was not a dialect of any province. I suspected they were XX people. After listening carefully, they were not speaking XX language. Coincidentally, two women also came from the stern, wearing the same hemp-stitched Korean clothes. The four of them were talking about a boat sailing away from us in the distance. At this time, a man with a Tianjin accent yelled strangely:</p>
<p>"XX boat, XX boat."</p>
<p>"No, no, Shengjing, Shengjing, British boat."</p>
<p>"Foreign boat! Faster than ours!"</p>
<p>"Shengjing is also foreign, not Japanese."</p>
<p>The Tianjin man asked them something in Korean, but they answered in Chinese:</p>
<p>"The tall ones are Korean, Korean."</p>
<p>The Tianjin man was very serious about them being Korean, and asked them what foreign company they worked for. They mumbled a few words, everyone laughed, and then dispersed.</p>
<h3>Dusk Outside the Fence</h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>Southern summers are so hot that you want to soak in cold water all day to feel comfortable. However, in the office, in addition to fanning yourself a few times, you also have to work wrapped in sweat.</p>
<p>Being buried at your desk all day writing fills your brain with jumbled words, and your mind is confused by meaningless sentences. As soon as you move your eyes away from the paper, you experience a phenomenon of blindness. Although a room is so small, it feels too vast at this time, and even the things placed next to you seem to stand too far away! Almost beyond the reach of your eyesight. If you look at the scorching sun outside the window, it's as if you've been hit by tear gas, your eye membranes hurt, and tears stream down.</p>
<p>When it was time to get off work, it was almost dark. Not a trace of the sun's afterglow remained on the horizon, only the evening glow in the distant sky was still shining. I moved my very tired body and walked out of this man-eating machine. It was as if countless crows were flying in front of me, flying in a jumble... As soon as I stepped out of the agency's fence, a dark shadow in front of me stopped me. I used great effort to see clearly what this thing blocking my way was: after a long time, I saw that it was a very haggard child, barefoot, wearing a set of shorts and a vest that country children usually wear, but it was already broken and there was not a complete piece left. He was also carrying an old bamboo hat on his shoulder. He stretched out a hand to me, and seemed to beg me with a "Sir!" His cyan face was covered with the scars of hunger, and also revealed the shyness that is unique to children in the wilderness.</p>
<p>"What!" My eyes widened a bit fiercely, as if the frustration accumulated in the fatigue of work was about to be vented on this thing. This short two-word question immediately caused a terror response in the child's heart. He only repeated a softer "Sir!" and the outstretched hand also trembled slightly. This made me strange. At first I thought he was a small beggar, but now I felt that my judgment was wrong. Curiosity made me temporarily forget my tiredness and asked him about his family situation and why he was blocking people's way at the door alone.</p>
<p>My question was like a poisonous thorn piercing his little heart; before the words could even be spoken, his little eyes were already moist with tears:</p>
<p>"Sir, I have a home, a home in Xikou, ten miles away from here. My father used to be a farmer, and I also had a mother, but..."</p>
<p>"Then why did you run to the city alone? Do you have relatives?" I asked impatiently. I suspected that the child was lost or had been abducted by bandits.</p>
<p>"No, I'm here to find my father. He hasn't been back for ten days."</p>
<p>"What, does your father live in the city?"</p>
<p>"Yes, he's in the city, he said he came to the city to pull a rickshaw."</p>
<p>"Then where does your father pull a rickshaw?"</p>
<p>"I don't know, he, he hasn't been back for ten days! I'm hungry, I've been hungry for two days, and I can't find him..."</p>
<p>After dinner, the tape recorder in the section chief's office played the mawkish song "Drizzling Rain" again. Outside the fence, I faced this poor child, not knowing what to do. I wanted to walk away, but I couldn't.</p>
<p>But if I don't walk away, what can I do?</p>
