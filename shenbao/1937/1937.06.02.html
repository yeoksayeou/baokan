<h3>德艦砲轟西港事件</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>西班牙內戰爆發以來，到現在已有十個多月。雙方的勝負還沒有到最後的揭曉日期。不過在上一月中。國際調停休戰的傳說非常盛行。而撤退各國志願兵的問題。也由不干涉委員會積極進行。要是這個建議能够成功。則西班牙的內戰或有縮短的希望。而政府軍的勝利也更有把握了。</p>
<p>可是在這國際空氣稍轉淸朗的時候，突然又來了一陣暴風雨。發生德艦轟擊阿爾米利亞港的事件。德國砲轟阿爾米利亞港的藉口。是上月二十九日停在瑪卓爾加島伊比柴港的袖珍巡洋艦“德意志”號被西政府軍飛機轟炸。死傷數十人。因而採取報仇行動。派遣戰艦五艘於三十一淸晨突然轟擊阿爾米利亞港。發砲達二百餘發之多。毀損房屋及擊斃婦孺無數。這種行為實是西班牙內戰發生後德國直接進攻西班牙及侵略西班牙領土主權之最顯明的表現。同時也是近年來國際上罕見的侵略行為。</p>
<p>德艦砲轟阿爾米利亞港之所以構成為侵略的行為。是根據於下列的二個理由。第一德意志號所停泊的伊比柴港是在叛軍的手中。且不屬於德艦行施監察職責的區域。因此政府軍飛機自有飛往偵察之權。而在偵察之時遇到德艦的砲擊。自然不免要予以還擊。這是正當的防禦行為。不能以此作藉口而慘無人道地砲轟阿爾米利亞港。第二。卽使如德方所說。德艦是未經挑釁而受西政府軍飛機的轟炸。就國際公法的原則說。也不能卽行採取報仇行動。轟擊對方港口。因為國際法上雖承認報仇（Reprisal此與報復Retorsion的意義不同）的原則。但報仇行為須在向對方提出交涉而不能得到滿意的解决時。方可施用。要是不然的話。那就不啻向對方開戰。構成侵略行為。而破壞國際法的原則。這次德艦被炸後。並未向西班牙提出交涉。而卽施行復仇何為。突然砲轟阿爾米利亞港。當然是直接侵略西班牙的行為。不為國際公法所容許。</p>
<p>我們如再退一步說。承認這次德國的報仇行為合於國際法的原則。但這種國際法的原則。也是為帝國主義國家的利益而設想的。因為强大的帝國主義國家常常借着復仇的行為去侵略弱小國家的利益。試看歷史上復仇行為的行使。沒有一件不是强國對付弱國的。就是近年日本的侵佔東北四省與轟炸上海。也曾經利用過報仇的原則。去欺騙歐美各國。所以我們不管西政府軍的轟炸德艦。是否先由於德艦的挑釁。但德國的行使復仇行動。轟擊阿爾米利亞港。總是不能容忍的侵略行為。</p>
<p>德國之所以不顧國際公法。公然進攻西班牙。是有很重大的作用的。第一。德意干涉西班牙內戰已達十餘月之久。而結果則困政府軍的堅决抵抗。未得順利發展。因此就自行直接挑戰。以洩仇恨。第二。國際監察計劃施行後。叛軍的外。援多少受到相當的阻碍。尤其是最近提出之撤退志願兵問題。對於叛軍頗為不利。於是他們想借這次事件。來破壞國際監察計劃的施行。而重伸干涉的魔手。這觀於此次事件發生後。德意卽决定退出監察計劃一點。就可瞭然。再次。阿爾米利亞為西班牙南岸臨近馬拉加港的重要港口。馬拉加自從二月間被意軍攻下後。叛軍卽向阿爾米利亞港進展。迄今數月。都未得手。這次德艦發砲二百餘發。把它的要塞都行轟毀。不管替以後叛軍的進攻開了一扇方便之門。</p>
<p>總之。德艦的砲轟西班牙。是借復仇之名而行侵略之實。對於國際危機的增重當然不言可喻。</p>
<h3>近衛不蹈林覆轍拉攏政黨入閣</h3>
<p>注重穩定非常時財政　物色繼任藏相遇困難</p>
<p>［東京］近衛公拜受大命後、鑒於時局嚴重、頃經最大努力詮衡閣員、以期組織强力內閣、據近衛公意見、因林內閣與政黨不和、招來失敗、擬避免與政黨發生摩擦、積極由政民兩黨起用人材為閣員、而於軍部政黨與財界三方面支持之下、組織强力內閣、軍部方面本有以近衛出馬實行革新政策之意圖、故對於其組閣表示同情、陸軍於一日晚、海軍於二日晨、正式通告杉山米內之留任、而近衛內閣之重大使命、乃為非常時財政之確立、故為內閣重心之大藏大臣人選、卽為能否實行近衛內閣使命之重大關鍵、政界一部雖有結城藏相留任之說、然近衛公對於此說、採取極愼重態度、至於政黨關係、業於一日晚對政友會中島知久平及民政黨永井柳太郎、進行入閣交涉、擬於二日對於個人進行正式交涉、完畢全閣員人選、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］近衛公於上午十時自私邸抵組閣本部、會見今晨入京之大阪府知事安井英二、並邀組閣參謀河原田內相、協議組閣第二步工作、但關於負打開前所未有之經濟國難重任之大藏大臣人選、殊不易發見適理人物、結城藏相之留任說、及馬塲藏相之再起說、均有難點、未易實現、故本日下午組閣工作將以此為重點而進行、祇須此關打破、其他閣僚縱有多少周折、亦不難迎刃而解、惟政民兩黨尤如民政黨對於近衛公之組閣態度、抱有多少之不滿、因而近衛公最初預定之組閣方策、亦似發生一部的障碍、（二日同盟電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］此間各方今日皆懸測日本駐美大使齋藤或有被任為新閣外相之可能、按以前林銑十郎組閣之時、亦曾擬以齋藤氏為外相、齋藤曾推辭不就云、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>［東京］擬任為藏相之前任正金銀行總辦兒玉謙次接到近衛公之電邀、當卽由岡倉赴京、現任該銀行總辮大久保利、賢迎兒玉於高崎、請其設法就任藏相、兒玉約以考慮、卽由熊谷車站下車、換乘汽車馳往東京、</p>

<h3>近衛健康堪勝重任</h3>
<p>平素喜高爾夫球不喜麻雀戰　初為理想家現為實際主義者</p>
<p>［東京］雙肩負起難局之靑年宰相近衛公之健康、在二•二六事件後、大命降下之際、曾成為拜辭之理由、為一般國民憂慮之的、今日上午經主持醫生宮川米次博士為之診檢、證明為足耐任何激務之健康身體、並謂近六尺之身二十貫（每貫合三•七五公斤）之巨軀、具有收拾風浪險惡之政局之力量云、</p>
<p>近衛文麿公之令弟音樂家秀麿談其賢兄之橫顏曰、家兄趣味僅為高爾夫球、旣不善圍棋與將棋、亦不喜麻雀戰、一切娛樂殆均外行、所喜者僅為觀賞運動及採其記錄而已、故可謂對於統計具有興味、此外亦嗜歷史、因此原因乃喜政治、在學生時代、一時曾為河上肇博士之私淑、但自卒業大學後、卽入貴族院、因實際政治之薰陶、遂由往年之理想家、一變為現實主義者、此奈個人之觀察也、又與余同樣、訥訥不善辯、平日殊沈默寡言、但一臨議會、則又滔滔雄辯矣、此外、與平人不同之一點、為一百個日本人中、其血液型殆一百人均為B型、獨有家兄為O型、故彼常戲言曰、“一朝罹大病而需要輸血時、誠難事矣”、答應負責之後、必堅幹到底、為人認眞不茍、然有時亦喜幽默、例如上次姪女舉行婚禮時、舉行假裝會、家兄特親往淺草購買假鬚、扮為希特勒而出場云、</p>
<p>為近衛內閣“產室”之貴院議長官舍、係明治二十三年議會創設時所建造之國寶的建築物、且近衛公之先代篤麿公為貴族院議長時、亦曾久居於是、公之幼年、蓋亦有若于時消度在此舊邸也、負收拾非常時政局之重任、受全日本期待之近衛公、在此回憶多多之官舍中、正不知感慨如何也、官舍之前、汽車之往返有如潮湧、室內電話機桌椅並陳、今日已為組閣之第二日、自淸晨起、河原田稼吉及後藤隆太郎等參謀資格人物、卽於二樓之洋案聚集、開始密議、但與以往之組閣風景不同者、旣無大規模之禮物、亦無尼以狂飲之大酒樽、而不免有岑寂之感、然近衛公之為人、已可由此窺見矣、（二日同盟電）</p>

<h3>豫西旱災中災民盼?救濟益急</h3>
<p>鬻妻賣女遍地哭聲　逃亡途中闔家盡喪</p>
<p>開封通訊、河南近幾年來、迭鬧災荒、首先是紅槍會殺人放火姦淫搶刦的蹂躪、繼而黃水為害、沿河萬衆、復作了犧牲、豈料緊跟而來的又有旱魃和颶魔、稽其慘狀、視諸民國二十年陝西的災况、超過十倍以上、被災九十餘縣中、有四十餘縣、赤地千里雞犬無聲、誠人間地獄也、</p>
<p>伊川•澠池•孟津•陝州、是豫西四十餘縣被災最慘縣份、這些縣份、都是四面環山、峯情疊峙、本為匪類出沒之所、自二十二年後、雖內部匪患已淸、而外匪竄擾、所過之處財物一空、如著匪崔二旦•劉玉來等出沒無常、軍隊梭巡圍剿、已無形中增加了人民的負擔、地方糜爛、居民流亡、扶老携幼、啼飢號寒、殆為普遍現象、在這情形之下、豈料旱災又至、去夏徂冬、滴雨不見、春麥不及二成、棉花每畝數斤、人民在恐慌飢渴之餘、方希望今年的麥收得以補救、不幸入春以來、仍然是滴點未降、四月十一日的颶風、十四日的冰雹、繼着又是苦霜、於是殘餘麥苗、由靑轉黃、由黃轉枯、以致田無轉生之禾、地無可掘之草、房屋頹塌、厲疫流行、而鳩形鵠面的災民遂遍地皆有、每見張牙露齒、腹賬如鼓的死屍、陳於大道、其平日較富之區、樹皮草根、剝食已盡、糠粃為地主專糧、白土石粉、為平民食品、以石塊充飢或誤食毒性草類的災民、都是眼紅頸腫、胸腹腫脹、大便結塞、不到半月、便呻吟倒斃、少壯者不甘餓斃、每每自殺殺人、老弱者除白縊投井之外、惟有束手待斃、其最慘血不容忽視者、為婦女之被賣、與嬰兒之被棄、蓋災民以食盡糧絕、相率出售妻女、以售得之價、作茍延殘喘之計、或作逃荒川資也售時、公然分等議價、姿色較好年在十七•八•及二十餘者十數元、至多二十元、卽可買得、議妥之後、哭聲與斥罵聲齊作、小兒牽衣案母、老者慘號呼兒、為夫為父者、飲泣呑聲、一任買主縛之而去、聞被賣之婦女、多運往揚州鎮江一帶、至於被棄之嬰兒、其年歲大都為三數月或半歲、拋擲牆角路邊、大聲啼哭、午夜不息、次日晨起則餓斃地上矣、</p>
<p>據最近各方報告、災民已至絕地、往外逃亡日必數千、婦女與老弱者、恒以飢憊交加、中途倒斃羣烏啄食其肉、情况至為慘怖、某村有趙姓壯丁、闔家大小四口、不堪餓斃、携妻及二子出外逃荒、長子六歲、幼僅四齡、夫挑行李前行、妻率二子後隨、相距不及半里、二子以飢疲交集、哭鬧索食、不肯前行、百勸不從、該婦情急、自籃取出剪刀、猛向自己喉間刺入、剪斷氣管、倒斃血泊中、兩兒見狀大哭、其夫返視、亦哀號欲絕、隨抱兩兒投擲山谷、自身亦躍入井中、一家數口、頃刻喪盡、諸如此類、筆不勝述、亦可哀矣、</p>
<p>經過多次呼籲救濟、已引起政府當局嚴重注意、同時滬上大慈善家陸怕鴻　朱子橋•等來豫勘查之後、遂决定派員携欵前來振災、上海慈聯會河南旱災查放辦事處、因而成立，並由副主任李紹鏵、主持河南振務、借天主堂一部分房屋為會址、略事籌備、卽開始工作、</p>
<p>慈聯會工作開始之前、開封已有省振務會在施行振務工作在同一目的之下、採取羣策羣力的辦法、彼此合作、於是在四月六日一度聯席會議之後、河南施振工作、乃緊張的進行、</p>
<p>欵項的來源、共有三處、除上海慈聯會獨提十萬元業已陸續寄到之外、中央與省方共撥六十萬元、合共七十萬元、除以十萬元提為工振外、其餘六十萬元分配被災最重之四十縣、然以災情過重災民過多、區區七十萬元、殊有杯水車薪之憾、</p>
<p>上述的施振工作之外、尚有地方慈善家私人組設救濟機關、如行都慈幼院長郭芳五氏、籌設可容一萬一千人的粥廠、和各地天主堂籌設的婦女救濟所、均在施行救濟之中、惜因經費困難、以致粥廠支待了不久、又宣告停辦勉得茍延的萬數災胞、又成了遍野哀鴻、故目下豫西災民之救濟、實急不容緩也、（五月三十一日）</p>

<h3>六三紀念感言</h3>
<p>— 陳凌雲</p>
<p>今日為九十八年前林文忠公虎門焚燬鴉片，引起國際糾紛，結果割地賠欵，開我國不平等條約之先河，為後世留一警惕沉痛之紀念，吾輩追懷先烈，於景仰感慨之餘，有不得已於言者。</p>
<p>夫鴉片之輸入我國，由來已久自虎門一炬，功敗垂成，外人得志，變本加厲以後，乃益根深蒂固，不可收拾，淸廷昏瞆，黜文忠公以二三無知之親王大臣，董理其事，圖茍安，忘實害，喪權辱國，委曲求全，國際地位一落千丈，在咸同光宣數朝，更造成富瞻民家以吸食鴉片為子弟保守遺產，腐敗官史以吸食鴉片為振作辦事精神之觀念，上下交賊，民族日衰，流毒至今，言之心痛！</p>
<p>自總理締造民國以來，即認定鴉片為國家之公敵，賡續前哲，發憤禁烟，惜為時不久軍閥橫行，寓禁於征，以充餉項，更縱容所部，販賣烟土，當時軍人暴戾恣瞧，除販賣外，類皆自身染有烟癖，故當時軍隊有“一人兩枝槍”之諺，而政府禁令時厲時弛，一曝十寒，遂無成效之可言，民國再造，革命軍底定全疆，乃以全神致力烟禁，兼總監更遵奉，總理拒毒遺訓，繼先賢未竟之功，苦心毅力，責為已任，確定有計劃有系統之二年禁毒六年禁烟政策，一反從前一厲一弛之政令，成算在胸，尅期責效，官民上下，一體恪遵，故數年來由全國黨軍政公務人員絕無烟癮，推而至於全國有識民衆皆知吸食鴉片為最恥行為，為最下流之嗜好，成效日著，氣象日新，吾輩歡欣鼓舞，知前路之光明可期，國家之復興有望。</p>
<p>然上述已著之禁烟成绩，僅為我國政令所能達到之區域而言，而在我国政令不能達到之各地特區或外人租借地，仍有無國家觀念自甘墮落之姦民托庇外力，逍遙法外，尚待我國政府及負有禁烟職責之官史，作最後之努力，以求禁烟政策之貫澈者也。年來兼總監對于禁烟之苦心孤詣，深得國聯之好評而各地租界當局，對於我國澈底禁烟决之漸能瞭解，一致表現協助之精神，烟民烟犯向以租界為護符之觀點，亦逐漸轉易，深知一日華區特區，政令一致，則彼輩責無生存之路，皆懷畏懼之心，將來禁令推行，不難一蹴而就，蓋往昔租界禁烟之無功，政令不能一致，固為主因，而一般人民不知自振，因觀念錯誤而形成今日畸形之局面，亦與有重大關係也，此後租界旣不願庇護我國之烟犯，而烟犯又能改變其思想，禁烟前途，殊可樂觀耳。</p>
<p>仰有進者，烟禁不難於空前，而難於絕後，凡屬辦理禁烟之各地方政府，應于六年禁絕政策完成以後，仍刻刻以禁烟為念，繼續防範，至于無窮，非達到全國人民永遠覺悟，不籍禁令而自然絕跡不止，庶足以表現國家民族之堅强，無負先哲禁烟之努力。</p>
<h3>禁烟與救國</h3>
<p>— 兪鴻鈞</p>
<p>比年吾國朝野上下，怵於邦國之危，口有言言救國，心有思思救國，此誠吾民族復興才朕兆。顧救國之道多端，而禁烟實為首急，蓋救國必以力，力分體，智，心，財，四種，曰訓練，曰敎育，曰生產，曰建設，與夫政府其他一切措施，社會種種活動，無非集中於此四種力之創發儲蓄，以求國人他日能負荷吾人所應負荷之重責！然一方面創發，一方面摧殘，一方面儲蓄，一方面銷耗，雖苦幹百年，必仍依然故我，奚補於救國哉。况人之創發日益急，儲蓄日益廣，我縱旦夕辛勤，人一我十，戰戰兢兢，從事儲蓄，以求渡過國難難關，延續民族生命，尚恐莫及，寗堪再事摧殘銷耗？而鴉片卽為摧殘銷耗，此四種救國原動力之頑敵！故鴉片不禁，不惟無餉可籌，抑且無兵可練。百年前，林則徐公，已痛夫言之，最近蔣兼總監訓示中，亦有“禁烟如果不能收效，其他一切政治建設工作，無論如何努力，均不能收效”之言。良以烟禍不能肅淸，一切力量，悉被銷蝕，根本則不能救國，我國民衆，對於鴉片之害身，知之矣或未能盡，對於鴉片之禍國，聞之矣或未能詳，而一般吸食鴉片，未肯戒除，或藉口未能戒除者，容或以為鴉片之禍，未若是其甚，是皆未明因果之律，及一身與一國之關、藉茲六三紀念，鴻鈞仰體中央暨蔣總理宣旨，敬將禁烟與救國不能離之關係，為我國人剴切一言之。</p>
<p>我國人最普遍最重大之病根，厥惟“惰”字，惰念一生，遂强未知為已知，强未行為已行，因是而事事敷衍苟且，得過且過，不求澈底，寖假而難振作，無廉恥，而人類又最富模仿性，任何個性强烈之人，絕不能不受接觸引誘，潛移默化之影響，於是一人惰，而一家惰，而舉國皆惰，馴至國破而不知憂，身危而不知救，靦覥倫生，求延殘喘，我國今日事事落後，種種蒙羞，何莫非“惰”之一字，為之厲階，而吸食鴉片又最足以增長惰念，養成惰習，鴉片之流入我國，始於唐，而吸食之盛行，則始於明末之崇禎，而吾民族亦自唐後而衰，至於宋而日益後落，吾人於此，當可恍然於鴉片之為禍矣！今舉國皆思救國，夫救國必具：體，智，心，財四力，如上述。然則如何充實此四種力，一言以蔽之，曰：“禁絕鴉片”，鴉片一日不禁絕，則此四種力一日不能充實，茲更細述其理由如左：</p>
<p>一•鴉片為戕賊體力之大敵，欲求救國，不能不禁絕鴉片能麻醉心臟，消滅血輪，削弱筋骨，斷喪元氣，幾於盡人皆知。故吸食之者，類皆肩聳肉削，萎靡衰頹，無日不在昏睡狀態中。　今日何日，今時何時，政府社會，為謀國家自立，爭民族生存，方注其全力於培養與鍛鍊國民體力，以求各個人均能於必要時，負荷救國責任，苟再容此戕賊體力大敵存在，則一切努力，均擲虛牝，故為充實國民救國體力起見，不能不禁絕鴉片，此其一。</p>
<p>二•鴉片為削智弱力之大敵，欲求救國，不能不能不禁絕。吸食鴉片，不但戕賊體力，抑且易使腦汁枯竭，神經衰弱，因之思想遲鈍，昏昧健忘，國人智識本已落後，政府除年費鉅欵，開辦學校外，今更極力提倡。民敎，厲行識字運動，原冀提高民衆智力。增進生活技能，誠以立國於今日，不但須於體力角勝，更須以智力爭雄，設鴉片不加禁絕，敎育功用，根本盡失，故為充實國民救國智力起見，不能不禁絕鴉片，此其二。</p>
<p>三•鴉片為敗心力大敵，為求國，不能不禁絕。所謂心力，即“不自私自利”，而有“强國之信念”，不“自私自利”，然後能舍己從人，以言利衆，以言福國，有“强固之信念”，而後能思想行動有一定之凖繩，合心合力，服從領袖，從事於救國救民之大衆，彼染有烟嗜者，自身才道德已無論，尚安得有“不自私自利”“强固信念”諸美德？喪失人類固有之天賦，而逐漸削蝕一國之國力，故為培養國民應有天賦，及充實救國心力起見，不能不禁絕鴉片，此其三。</p>
<p>四•鴉片為消耗財力之大敵，為求救國，不能不禁絕。吸食鴉片者，每年消耗其所得於鴉片之購買，因種種特殊情形，字數雖難確定！然每年必在若于萬萬以上，則可斷言，苟以此數移用於生產建設，或其他有益事業，則定可福國利羣，苟移之於建設國防，則更可計日程功，今坐視此鉅金錢，消耗於吸人骨髓之毒液，不明熟甚！故為充實國民救國財力起見，不能不禁絕鴉片，此其四。</p>
<p>凡此四者，皆人人所能道，人人能明，即彼吸食鴉片者，亦都能自覺，第其所以不肯戒除者，多坐於其心理見解之錯誤。換言之，卽不明因果之律，及一身與一國之關是也。蓋揣彼吸食者之心理，以為鴉片之戒除與否，利害僅限於一身，與人無關，與國更無關，不知近代國家之組織，有如人之一身，茍一部分細胞有病，則全體均受其害，建國於今日，又如大厦之構築，苟一磚一瓦之未固，迨大風雨之來襲，或致全厦於傾覆，吾人處今日之中國，何以異是？故吸食鴉片者，倘明此意，𢛔關於個人所佔地位之重要，與夫國家所處環境之危險，當能翻然省悟，自動戒除，則政府禁烟，可以收事半功倍之效，而救國工作，亦可推行無阻，非然者，禁絕限期一屆，政府為整個民族生存計，當忍痛從事於受痛部分之排除，不復再為執迷不悟者恕矣。</p>
<p>抑我國此次禁烟，實為最末次之禁烟，蓋禁而成，則中國從此當無烟禍，禁烟二字害不復見，禁而不成，則國際信用益墮，國難從此益深，中國將不復能言禁烟，由此以觀，我國之生死存亡，胥繁於禁烟之有成無成，吾人紀念林文忠公，當一本其澈底奮鬥之精神，以從事於烟禍之肅淸，庶不令其有餘痛於地下也。</p>
<h3>如何可以完成我們禁烟的使命</h3>
<p>— 杜月笙</p>
<p>一，與租界當局合作二，切實辦理烟民登記三，增設戒烟醫院</p>
<p>禁烟是一個事實，而不是一個理論，所以關於禁烟問題，自從蔣兼總監規定一個六年禁絕計劃以後，博得國內外𤍠烈的同情與希望。再不必談理論，我們祗有切實奉行，按步就班的去做就是了。</p>
<p>在上海而論，執行禁烟的機關有上海市政府與市警察局，辦理得很得宜；監督，建議，宣傳等項工作，有特派員公署及禁烟委員會，也盡了他們的責任。不過就在上海的環境觀察，因為有租界的關係，情形比較複雜一些；就是我們假定僅僅把上海市行政勢力所達的地方把烟禁絕，不能說已經完畢我們的任務，勢必設法要與租界當局合作，使租界能諒解這種合作，是一種正義，是一種義務，而不是一種奪取或是一種權利。原則上現在上海市兪代市長已經與租界當局有過一次談判，情形是很好，所以我很希望這一件事，能够雙方開誠佈公的諒解，再進一步的有具體辦法商定；使整個的上海，能够遵照蔣兼總監的計劃，按步實現，不但上海一隅，禁烟告完成，整個中國禁烟，也可收到極大的效果，這是我希望的第一點。</p>
<p>現在關於烟民登記，據上海市警察局的統計，有四萬餘人，不過就本市烟民總數而言，恐怕還未曾普及。這點雖然是因為租界的關係，或是烟民觀望的關係；然而我們宣傳的力量和方法，總有缺點之處。現在政府方面，仍舊允許烟民可以補行登記，並且取費極廉，保障方面，也極有效力；深望烟民能够覺悟，趕快去向市警察局去登記。同時希望負有宣傳的機關和團體，要百尺竿頭再進一步，去想法喚醒一般烟民，使本市所有的烟民，統統去登記，使政府有一個精確的統計，這個於完成禁政，大有關係的，希望大家不要漠視了，這是吾要說的第二點。</p>
<p>關於年老疾病，或因其他關係而吸上的烟民，我們希望他們幹快去領照登記；同時對於一般年輕力壯的靑年，有為不幸而染上烟癮的同胞，我十二萬分的希望他們覺悟，有决心去醫院戒掉，我敢擔保在身體上，戒烟是沒有痛苦的，不必怕。在信譽上，過去人家不信任你，假如你戒了烟，人家一定可以恢復你的信任。做事就可有把握了。同時希望政府關於已設立的戒烟醫院，經費務使充足，在計劃中要設立的戒烟醫院，從速實現。使請求戒烟的烟民，一來就戒，不要使他們失望，這是第三點。</p>
<p>今天我趁六三紀念特刋的地位，約略發表我個人的一些觀感，可以說一點也沒有系統，希望讀者加以原諒和指正。</p>

<h3>國際勞工公約之制定與實施</h3>
<p>— 程海峯</p>
<p>國際勞工組織之宗旨在改良各國工人之地位，並由此而　努力於社會正義及國際　和平之維護，固非一政治團體，二旣無政治主張，更無政治企圖。凡一切國際上之敵對與仇視在政治上佔有重要地位者，該組織皆不過問。其目的乃在從社會上及經濟上，努力於提高工人的生活標準。故在憲章中特別規定勞動狀况之方法與原則九項：㊀不得將勞工視作貨物或商品，此為主要原則。㊁工人與僱主皆應有集會結社權，只須其宗旨合法。㊂工人之工資，應按照時勢及地方情形，而認為足能維特適當　之生活程度而給付之。㊃凡未施行每日工作八小時每週四十八小時之制度者，應積極以採行此制度為目的。㊄採用每週至少有二十四小時休息之制度，並應於可能範圍內，將星期日包括在休息日內。㊅廢止童工及限制幼年男女之勞動，使彼輩能繼續就學，並完成身體上之正當發育。㊆男工與女工做同等價值之工作者，應得相同之工資。㊇各國規定關於勞動狀况之標準時，應給合法居住境內之一切工人以經濟上　平等之待遇。㊈各國應設立檢查制度，並用婦女於此項工作，以保證勞工法規之實行。</p>
<p>國際勞工組織　本上述之方法與原則，以謀達到改良勞工生活　及促進國際和平。其具體方法，卽為制定公約草案及建議書，以供各國之採擇實行。此項公約草案及建議書，由每年國際勞工大會制定之，為國際勞工組織中心工作之一。</p>
<p>國際勞工大會之議事日程，先由理事院决定。每一問題在提交大會討論之前，必先經理事院之一再研討，（如有必要時，得將某一問題交專門委員會研究）茍認為有列入大會議事日程之可能者，卽請勞工局編一簡單報告，敘述此問題在各國之立法及習慣情形，而後理事院始作最後之决定。倘該問題經理事院通過，列入大會議事日程，勞工局卽須做一詳細報告（亦稱灰色報告，因其封面為灰色，）用備大會討論時之參考。每一問題之討論時間頗長，按目前所行之兩級討論制，自討論以至决議，須經兩年。第一年之大會先根據灰色報告作一初步之討論，决定該問題有否制成公約草案或建議書之必要。若然，則同時决定對於該問題應向各會員國詢問之點，勞工局當卽根據大會所决定之要點，製成紅色詢問書，分送各會員國政府諮請答覆。再據各國答案編一最後報告，（亦稱藍色報告）報告之末尾並附有公約草案或建議書，以備下屆大會之採擇。第二年之大會，即根據此藍色報告以作最後之决議。按大會章程，公約草案之制定，須經大會出席全體會員三分之二以上之通過，方能成立。此種公約所規定之內容，並非永久不變。已制定之公約，如因環境之變遷而有改善之必要時，可隨時提出修正，加以改善，而制成修正公約草案。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>六三談禁烟</h3>
<p>— 嚴昶</p>
<p>寫下這題目，覺得有些不自然，為什麼一定要到六三才談禁烟呢？正如到了五月，才想起了國恥一樣。溯自一八三九雅片戰爭以來，到現在將近一百年了，在這樣長久的時間中，我們還在每年的六三談禁烟，眞是從那裏說起呢！不過，有些人的腦筋也麻木得可憐，恐怕虧得有這樣一天定為禁烟紀念日，才會想起我們“遍地皆毒”的痛苦，像五月裏看到鮮血淋淋的恥日，才喊出被壓迫民族該是翻身的時候了！所希望的，把這些日子不要看做“例行公事”，在當天喊一陣，唱一陣就算了。要禁烟就要禁絕，要雪恥就得埋頭苦幹，要每天是六三，每天是國恥。</p>
<p>本市各界六三禁烟大會已决定於今日上午八時起，請航空協會派出飛機四架，携帶五彩標語，在天空散發。九時起，各界代表在市商會大禮堂開紀念大會，製有六三禁烟紀念章分發各到會代表。十一時起，在天后宮樹基小學內焚燬毒品。下午一時起，由市黨部等機關組織演講隊出發四區演講，並備各種傳單標語分發。其他八大日報出版紀念特刋，游藝團體播送禁烟節目等。從上面的辦法看來，此次紀念已經超出了“例行公事”以上了，卽使腦筋麻木到若何程度，大概也能知道毒之為害了吧？</p>
<p>不過，筆者還有一點意見，就是上面的辦法祇做到了“安內”，在目前敵人的“毒化政策之下，我們似乎應該先要“攘外”吧。遠的且不說，如偽滿，冀東一帶的烟館林立，“特殊”情形下的津平，也是公開發賣，卽如哄傳一時的“浮屍”事件，據該地新聞檢查處通令各報館應一例稱偽“毒丐”，雖然眞相如何，還是不知道，可是有一部份是受“毒”過深，因而為“丐”，大概也在意料之中。而近在咫尺的上海呢，北四川路就發生過警士因搜捕烟犯而被毆傷過，上月卅日的晚報新聞也有“今晨七時五十分京滬路北站滬平通車抵站，有韓國人下來，形色甚為慌張，殊屬可疑，乃經北站警察分局崗警喝令止步，上前施行檢查，結果在該韓人兩腿所縛之布包內，抄獲嗎啡約重四十四兩……………該韓國浪人名鄭寅，最近在法租界馬浪路一百九十五號秘密設立販售嗎啡等毒品機關，專銷我埠與本市，零蔓批發”等語，這些還是因破獲而見之於報章的，其他“秘密設立販售嗎啡等毒品機關”的浪人不致於就會絕跡吧。所以，祗做到“安內”，還是消極的辦法，要禁烟就應該禁絕，希望今天的紀念會就由“安內”而做到“攘外”！</p>
<h3>十五齡女童成鬥牛名手</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>嘩噠噠！嘩噠噠！一陣喇叭聲響時，葡京里斯本一個大鬥牛塲頓時把塲門開啟，只見一位瘦伶伶的女孩，得意洋洋地騎在馬背上，馳入塲心，於是塲內的數千觀衆，一排排像坐在高階上一般，一齊鼓掌歡迎，全塲目光都射在那穿着黑白相間衣服的女孩臉上。女孩名呌康奇泰，今年才十五歲，却是全世界唯一的女性騎馬鬥牛家。她並且是騎馬的能手，她常常覓求最悍猛的雄牛，跟牠相鬥，表演她的勇敢跟技能。她年紀雖小，可是秘魯的鬥牛專家見了她的表演，都驚服她的神技。</p>
<p>女孩名字的拚音，雖然近於拉丁文，她却是美國人。她的媽媽是有名著作家浮利爾的女兒，她的爸爸名呌里康，曾在美國西端陸軍專校畢業。她到里斯本獻藝，是在葡國的第一次表演。葡國是鬥牛發源地，又是鬥牛人才的薈萃所，手段不高明的鬥士，不敢前去獻醜。康奇泰女士却自信很有把握，她的酬勞費，約合美金一千二百元，第一天表演，居然馬到功成，這日她鬥敗了兩雙猛牛，後來，她又在沃波爾士表演了兩次。</p>
<p>騎在馬上鬥牛，跟尋常步行鬥牛，完全不同。騎馬鬥牛並不把牛殺死，獨個兒在塲中跟牛來去回合，並沒有助手拿着耀目的披肩，隨時準備奔上，向牛舞動披肩，引牛注意，好讓鬥者刺擊，還有穿着金銀色射光衣服的人們，在鬥士跟牛相逼太近，情勢危險的當兒，便在牛的左右，奔來奔去，使那怒牛目眩心亂，借此救護鬥士。那助手的人數，三個五個，並無一定。</p>
<p>至於騎馬鬥牛的目標，只有馬跟騎在馬上的鬥士。鬥士不拿着耀目的披肩，也不執槍，跟其他武器，全靠技能勇敢，跟騎馬術，閃避牛的銳角，非有眞實功夫，是不敢下塲的。</p>
<p>康奇泰女士生在智利國阿士法迦斯泰鎮，數歲時，遷居秘魯京城利馬，便一直住在那裏。她從小不愛穿女孩的服裝，却喜歡穿騎馬短褲。她的父母再三勸導，她總置之不睬。有一次她竟穿了騎馬短褲到敎堂裏去，她的爸爸便用善言儆戒她。她回答道：“爸爸，我怕錯過祈禱時間，趕不及換衣服，可能容我這一次”。她的爸爸便一笑而罷，並且說道：“好孩子，你年紀很小，我想還不妨事，進去吧”。</p>
<p>她在秘魯屢次表演騎術，並跟最精的騎手比賽，得到許多絲帶，銀杯，跟獎章。任何烈馬，她騎到背上，總能自自在在地駕馭牠，毫不覺得費力。葡國鬥牛錦標手加米拉氏在遊秘魯的當兒，偶然看見她騎馬奔馳，暗暗稱奇，於是便跟她結識，把鬥牛的技能傳授她。她天資聰慧，一學便會，不到幾時，竟像一個老手，所以在十二歲時，她便在利馬下塲表演，居然一舉成名。於是老師加米拉氏便勸她到里斯本一顯身手，她後來在里斯本表演了兩次，她的技能跟勇敢，得到葡萄牙門牛名家的同聲稱讚。</p>
<p>假使你跟她交遊熟了她會領你到利馬傢中去看她的收藏室，那簡直是一個博物院。室內陳列着她競賽得到的許多銀杯，獎章，跟許多銀製的踢馬刺。這些踢馬刺，也有是她自己比賽得來的，也有當代鬥牛家跟運動家贈給她的，據說南美全部踢馬刺收藏家，當推女士為第一，其中都是極精美之品。此外還有</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>許多陶器，跟刀劍馬鞍等物。</p>
<p>她很愛動物，她家裏養着許多犬，馬，兎子，松鼠，鴿子，跟長尾鸚鵡。但最愛的是犬馬二物，她教牠們作許多極奇異的玩意，牠們的一舉一動，都能聽她的調度。</p>
<p>有人問她願意繼續從事危險的運動麽？女士笑着答道：“我不敢説”。也許她性情活潑，會忽然變更心思，放棄鬥牛的玩意，從事較安全的運動。她再次鬥單牛所得的報酬，從美金三百元到五百元不等，鬥雙牛的酬金，却增到八百元。她也曾承認鬥牛的危險，但又説道：“我愛這個玩意，並不把危險放在心頭。鬥牛大約可算得最危險的運動，當那兇猛的雄牛發出牠的蠻勁，用牠的尖鋭長角東衝西撞，鬥者的生死，却在呼吸之間。可是鬥牛跟其他危險的運動相同，假使没有驚心動魄的動作，那便要使觀衆掃興了。我每次下塲，當然也遇到種種危險，但我騎着親自調馴的馬上，從未想到我會陷於不能閃避的地位，所以我始終放心大膽，把牛鬥敗才罷”。</p>
<p>秘魯現在鬥牛塲中仍用助手牽擾牛的注意，使鬥士容易奏功，但秘魯人却很愛看康奇泰女士單人匹馬的鬥牛戲。</p>
<h3>眼睛</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<p>當我和妻正在井畔洗菜淘米的時候，妻悄悄地對我說：</p>
<p>“你這幾天見過小六子麼？這小女孩的眼睛快瞎了。”</p>
<p>我以為這是妻壓惡她，在咀咒她，但妻却嘆了一口氣。</p>
<p>“十四歲的小孩子就瞎了眼睛，後半生要怎麼過呢？何况是女孩”</p>
<p>妻剛說定，小六子已進開竹門，携着水桶走過來。</p>
<p>立刻，我證實了妻說的話，她的左眼皮已發炎，一粒眼珠子已失去了小孩子固有的光澤，反像熟魚的眼睛一樣，但又網着血丝，眼眶周遭堆着一大堆眼糞。那粒眼珠凸出，好像一動就會掉下來，四邊漾着一泓蓝色的液體。</p>
<p>這難看的形像使我猛然打個寒噤，我忍不住問：</p>
<p>“小六子，你的眼睛怎的？</p>
<p>她轉過頭去，不回我的話，她小小的心早給難堪的苦痛揉碎了。她汲了水，依然斜着頭走，不讓我們瞧見她的眼睛，好像這疾病於她有說不出的恥辱。</p>
<p>“這病是那裏傳來的，上幾天不是還滿好麼？”</p>
<p>“誰也不曉得，她自己也不說。房東說她父親有很重的淋病，小六的姊姊也是瞎了眼睛死去的。”</p>
<p>我像分了這不幸的小女孩的命運一般，心裏非常悶謬，我回想起方才妻說過的話，這小女孩有後半生實在是一片漆黑的。失了眼睛還有談到人生的樂趣麼？</p>
<p>夜裏，我們已經睡熟了，但給一陣吵鬧聲哄醒起來。是小六子的爸媽吵架。等吵聲過後，夜又回復了往常的靜寂。只有秋末的哀虫在悲泣着。</p>
<p>我又想起那個在這種家庭內長大起來的小女孩，突然，我注意到似有一個人在我的窗後哭泣，聲音雖然非常低微，但並未給虫聲掩沒。我問問妻。</p>
<p>“你聽，是小六子的哭聲麼？這女孩眞可憐。”我按不下心，下床來打開窗。在月光下，我隱約看見一團黑影，在臨後溝的石階上。</p>
<p>“是小六麼”我這樣問。但她並沒有動，也沒有回答。</p>
<p>“唉，生活在那樣的家庭裏，”妻頓了頓，嘆了一口氣。“當父親的雖然窮得上餐顧不到下餐，却只管吃喝，嫖賭，那種壞東西不爛他自己的眼睛，反而害了女兒，這是命哩。”</p>
<p>我聽着，聽着那啜泣聲，緩緩入夢了。</p>
<p>然而從那天晚上之後，我就永遠不再看見小六，因為她在當天晚上跳下河溝，但河溝太淺，於是她解下褲帶，穿着那身濕淋淋的衣服，縏在一株白揚上縊死了。直到隔天早上她的爸媽還不知道。</p>
<p>“這小女孩也太硬性了。但她那顆十四歲的心，也許比別些成年人還多裝些辛苦……”妻一提到小六子就這樣說。但我却永遠不會忘記那粒像故鄉的龍眼核一樣的眼睛。</p>

<h3>Our Capture of a Thief Selling National Land Provokes a Protest from the Japanese Consul in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Gu Wenfu Released on Bail After Arrest   The Shengnong Garden Suddenly Catches Fire Yesterday   Police Seize Various Materials   Reported to the Municipal Government for Deliberation</p>
<p>[Tianjin] A Japanese man named Shima Eizan established an agricultural company called Shengnong Garden in Tianjin. He purchased 50 "yin" (a unit of area) of land near Chentangzhuang in Tianjin County through a Chinese man named Gu Wenfu. After discovering this, the county government arrested Gu for stealing and selling national land. During interrogation, Gu claimed that he only rented the land to the Japanese for agricultural improvement purposes, with a monthly rent of one yuan per mu (another unit of area), without any deposit, and denied any involvement in selling national land. The county government argued that the land was entirely academic property and could not be leased to foreigners without permission, ordering Gu to terminate the lease. Gu refused. At this time, the Japanese Deputy Consul Nishida lodged a verbal protest, later visiting Chen Zhongyue, stating that the Japanese had permanent lease rights in treaty ports and that arresting Gu Wenfu and preventing the development of the Shengnong Garden by the Japanese violated the spirit of economic cooperation. Chen responded that whether Tianjin County was a treaty port needed clarification, which he, as an administrative official, could not answer. Furthermore, Gu Wenfu was a Chinese citizen, and the county government had the right to punish him for violating national laws. Chen went to Peiping (now Beijing) the next day and reported the matter to Zhang Zizhong for instructions. Zhang instructed that if the Japanese came to negotiate again, they should be directed to the municipal government. On the morning of the 2nd, the Shengnong Garden suddenly caught fire. According to a report from the Chentangzhuang police station to the county government, the office building of the Japanese-owned Shengnong Garden south of Chentangzhuang caught fire at 2:00 AM. The county government ordered the police to rush to extinguish the fire, and there were no reports of destruction as claimed by the Japanese. After an investigation on the 2nd, the Tianjin County Magistrate Chen Zhongyue is now reporting to and consulting with relevant parties. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Gu Wenfu, who was arrested in the Shengnong Garden incident, was released on bail on the evening of the 2nd after the Tianjin County government sought instructions from above at the request of Japanese residents. It is said that this was done to prevent the situation from escalating. The Japanese Deputy Consul Nishida went to the Municipal Government on the morning of the 2nd, where he was received by someone sent by Secretary-General Ma Yanchong. Nishida raised four protests: ① Release Gu Wenfu; ② Japanese leasing of land in Tianjin County is legal; ③ Protect the safety of Japanese residents; ④ Alleviate the anxiety of Japanese residents. The municipal government has not yet responded. Regarding the arson at Shengnong Garden, the county authorities, in addition to receiving the police report, also sent the section chief Li Haihuan and police chief Bai Wulun of the county government, together with personnel from the Japanese police station, to investigate. They have obtained various materials and submitted them to the Provincial Governor's office that evening, preparing for negotiations with the Japanese on the 3rd. The burnt parts were all thatched huts and in a wilderness. It is speculated that if someone committed arson, it could not have been done so easily. According to the county authorities, the evidence in this matter is very clear, and the general situation can be understood even without investigation. The Japanese side had not made any statement on the matter as of the 2nd. It was also noted that according to the county authorities, the incident occurred at 2:00 AM, while a Japanese newspaper published here on the morning of the 2nd claimed that it occurred at 1:00 AM.

<p>Original Text of Liu Zhi's Opening Speech</p>
<p>[Kaifeng] During the opening of the Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu Military Reorganization Conference, Chairman Liu Zhi's opening speech was as follows: "Distinguished Commissioners, Distinguished Representatives, Distinguished Comrades, this is the first meeting of this conference. You have spared no effort to attend from afar, which is not only gratifying to the central government, but also a great honor to me. This conference was established on April 29 after receiving instructions from the Military Affairs Commission. The date of the first meeting was originally scheduled for May 12, but I was ordered to go to Beijing, so it was postponed to today. All preparations were made hastily, and I must apologize to you for this. The purpose of the central government in establishing this conference is to reorganize and improve the garrisons in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, and to entrust this conference with the responsibility of consultation and advice. Because the commissioners of this conference are all senior officers of the Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu garrisons, or are related to the garrisons, they not only have excellent knowledge and experience and can contribute good ideas to the central government, but also are familiar with the situation of the various armies. The opinions put forward will naturally be practical and easy to implement, and there will be no problems that are incompatible or unworkable. This is a thorough method of the central government to take into account both top and bottom, be open and honest, and gather ideas from all sources. It is also our supreme commander's consideration that there may be difficulties in the reorganization, so he first orders us to contribute our opinions, and then adopts and implements them, so that the implementation will be smooth. Here, we should stand up and express our gratitude and respect to our supreme commander and leader (all stood up). Speaking of reorganizing the army, some people who do not understand have narrow views and think that this is an unfavorable action against a certain unit, which inevitably leads to suspicion. And when I mention the word reorganization, I feel infinite emotion. We only see that the powerful countries in the world, in order to implement their policies, have been desperately expanding their military preparations in recent years. The armies of their countries have already established a modern foundation and have already had great strength, but they still think it is not enough. Their ambition to improve and make rapid progress is truly what is meant by subduing the enemy without fighting. In contrast, our country's army, according to recent statistics, has more than two million, which is truly alarming in terms of quantity. But from the revolution to today, because of the oppression of foreign troubles and the rampant bandits, although we have so many troops, we have not had the opportunity to gather, reorganize, and train them, whether to resist the enemy or to suppress the bandits. The material aspect is even more scarce, and perhaps because of the various historical relationships, they still maintain their previous groups and the form of unique control. Therefore, the organization, personnel, management, education, etc., are not uniform, and the ideology and will cannot be unified. Within a unified country, there is still this disparate phenomenon. Our national defense strength can be imagined. How can we resist the torrent of international aggression? Where will our military be placed? In order to seek the survival of the nation, we can only take this opportunity to reorganize our army, seek quality improvement, and strengthen our national defense strength. The purpose of our reorganizing the army is to seek quality improvement and strengthen our national defense strength. Anything that hinders its improvement in quality, such as the lack of uniformity in organization and salary regulations, the independent management of personnel and management, the independence of education and training, and the vastness of thought and the divergence of opinions, will not only fail to strengthen the national defense strength, but will also lead to the danger of a crumbling and divisive situation. Looking at the past of our country, such as the division of the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the vassal towns of the Tang Dynasty, the struggles of the Five Dynasties, and the disturbances of the modern Republic of China, these are all past experiences and are very painful things. Now our revolutionary soldiers are loyal to the country and will certainly not have these facts, but the establishment of the national army has its own normal track. What is the normal track? It is that military administration and military orders must be sound and unified. All personnel, management, health, education, etc. must be unified under the central government, follow the central government's laws and regulations, and implement them accurately. They must absolutely obey the orders of the supreme commander and take the will of the supreme commander as their will. Only in this way can we have a consistent and united spirit, and only then can we plan and improve in accordance with the progress of the times. We must first achieve nationalization and then modernization. With a nationalized and modernized army, any humiliating national humiliation can be washed away, and any serious national disaster can be resolved. This is the example of the Meiji Restoration in Japan and the unification of Germany and Italy. Now the national humiliation is getting deeper and the national disaster is getting more urgent. How to wash away the national humiliation and how to resolve the national disaster, this important responsibility is on our shoulders and cannot be conceded or shirked. The people of the whole country expect us to be able to shoulder the arduous tasks and complete our mission. I think that although the road ahead is long, if we can first nationalize and modernize the entire army, we will surely reach the goal one day. Today is the first meeting, and what I want to say is only this much. What the central government expects of us is also this. I hope that you will express your outstanding views and discuss together in order to ensure the thorough completion of the reorganization work. This is the blessing of the country and the nation, and it is also the good fortune of the army itself. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st)"</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Orders Cautious Handling of Opium Suppression Cases</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Chiang Kai-shek, the Superintendent of Opium Suppression, recently issued an order to the provincial and municipal governments, stating, "Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Opium Suppression stipulates that from the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), those who manufacture, transport, sell, or consume opium shall be sentenced to death. The legislation is undoubtedly strict, but ignorant individuals disregard the law and try their luck, and such cases are still occurring in many places. Thinking of this, I am deeply saddened. Those whose circumstances are excusable may apply the provisions of the criminal law for reduced punishment, but those who willingly abandon themselves to evil and those who show no fear of the law must be punished with the most severe penalty to deter the cunning and rebellious. Recently, some provinces, cities, and counties have had fair and impartial judges dealing with opium cases, but there have also been many arbitrary acquittals. Hereafter, in handling such cases, it is imperative to conduct thorough investigations and interrogations, with unwavering focus, so that caution is exercised even amidst strictness. I hope you will convey this message to your subordinates and that all will understand this principle." (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Plans to Allocate Disaster Relief Funds to Various Provinces</h3>
<p>2.94 Million in Bonds, 2.01 Million in Cash</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance has already allocated funds for disaster relief in Henan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Guangxi, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Hebei, and Qinghai provinces, which have suffered from disasters. A reporter recently visited the person in charge at the Ministry of Finance and inquired about the planned allocation of disaster relief funds. He replied as follows: "Since the first half of this year, provinces such as Henan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Guangxi, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Hebei, Qinghai, Xikang, and Ningxia have been requesting disaster relief funds due to various disasters such as floods, droughts, banditry, epidemics, wind, snow, insects, and hailstorms. The Ministry has already allocated disaster relief funds to each province separately. The allocations are as follows: Henan Province: 300,000 in bonds; Gansu Province: 550,000; Sichuan Province: 160,000; Guizhou Province: 330,000; Shanxi Province: 500,000, plus 100,000 in cash; Shaanxi Province: 300,000 in cash; Guangxi, Suiyuan, and Qinghai Provinces: 100,000 in cash each; Hebei Province: 100,000 in bonds. Other provinces such as Ningxia and Xikang have been allocated 20,000 to 30,000 or 40,000 to 50,000 each. Since the second half of this year (i.e., this year), especially after the arrival of spring, provinces such as Henan, Sichuan, and Guizhou have been suffering from severe droughts, with the affected areas covering dozens or even hundreds of counties. The Ministry has continued to allocate 1 million in bonds to Sichuan Province, 320,000 in cash to Henan Province for urgent projects, and 400,000 in cash to Guizhou Province. All these funds will be jointly supervised and distributed by the Disaster Relief Committee and special commissioners, and the Ministry will also send additional personnel to investigate the distribution separately. The Ministry is also working with relevant departments and the affected provinces to expedite the handling of agricultural and industrial relief loans. Recently, Guangxi Province reported that it suffered from rising tides during the summer and autumn of last year and is now experiencing drought this spring. Qinghai Province is suffering from banditry after last year's epidemic. Gansu Province reported that the disaster situation in counties such as Hexi, Ganliang, and Su is very severe, and the funds allocated by the Ministry are insufficient for disaster relief. Shaanxi Province also reported that it is suffering from drought after military disasters and that refugees are urgently requesting relief. All provinces have requested additional disaster relief funds. Since the Ministry is not fully aware of the disaster situation in each province, and the means by which funds should be allocated further, the Ministry has sought advice with various relevant departments, and has requested the Executive Yuan to convene a meeting of various departments to discuss the matter. The result of the discussion is that it is proposed to allocate 100,000 in cash to Shaanxi and Gansu provinces each, 50,000 in cash to Guangxi Province, and 30,000 in cash to Qinghai Province as a supplement. According to statistics, the total amount of funds allocated by the Ministry this year, including the amount that is currently planned to be allocated, is 2.94 million in bonds and 2.01 million in cash, which greatly exceeds the amount that should be allocated from the central government's disaster relief reserve fund for the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936). (The central government's disaster relief reserve fund for the 25th year of the Republic of China was listed as 2 million, and only half of it, 1 million, could be used.) The central government empathizes with the people's difficulties, and has exhausted all its efforts to maintain this situation despite the extreme shortage of funds. However, the disaster area is too large, and it is difficult to provide relief to all disaster victims if relying solely on central government subsidies. Although some affected provinces have also independently raised funds for relief in addition to the funds allocated by the Ministry, most provinces have not been able to independently raise sufficient funds and work together for relief. After review by the Yuan and Ministry, it is proposed to instruct each province to raise disaster relief funds equal to or greater than the amount allocated by the Ministry in order to cooperate fully."

<h3>The German Naval Bombardment of Almeria Incident</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The Spanish Civil War has been going on for over ten months now since its outbreak. The outcome between the two sides has yet to be definitively decided. However, last January, rumors of an internationally mediated ceasefire were rife, and the Non-Intervention Committee was actively working on the issue of withdrawing foreign volunteer soldiers. If this proposal could succeed, the Spanish Civil War might have the hope of being shortened, and the victory of the government forces would be more assured.</p>
<p>However, just as this international atmosphere was beginning to clear, a sudden storm arose again. The incident of the German naval bombardment of the port of Almeria occurred. Germany's pretext for shelling the port of Almeria was that on the 29th of last month, the pocket battleship "Deutschland," anchored in the port of Ibiza on Mallorca Island, was bombed by Spanish government aircraft, resulting in dozens of casualties. As a result, a retaliatory action was taken, and five warships suddenly shelled the port of Almeria on the morning of the 31st, firing over two hundred rounds, destroying houses and killing countless women and children. This action is the most obvious manifestation of Germany's direct attack on Spain and the invasion of Spain's territorial sovereignty since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. At the same time, it is also a rare act of aggression in the international arena in recent years.</p>
<p>The German naval bombardment of the port of Almeria constitutes an act of aggression based on the following two reasons: First, the port of Ibiza, where the Deutschland was anchored, is in the hands of the rebels and does not fall within the area of ​​responsibility of the German warships to exercise their surveillance duties. Therefore, government aircraft have the right to fly to reconnaissance. When encountering the German warship's fire during reconnaissance, it is inevitable to fight back. This is a legitimate act of defense and cannot be used as an excuse to inhumanely shell the port of Almeria. Second, even if, as the German side claims, the German warship was bombed by Spanish government aircraft without provocation, according to the principles of international law, retaliatory action cannot be taken immediately by shelling the opposing port. Although international law recognizes the principle of retaliation (Reprisal, which is different in meaning from Retorsion), retaliatory action can only be taken when negotiations with the other party have been made and a satisfactory solution cannot be obtained. Otherwise, it would be tantamount to declaring war on the other party, constituting an act of aggression, and undermining the principles of international law. This time, after the German warship was bombed, it did not negotiate with Spain but immediately implemented retaliation. Suddenly shelling the port of Almeria is, of course, a direct act of aggression against Spain and is not permitted by international law.</p>
<p>If we take a step back and admit that Germany's retaliatory action this time is in accordance with the principles of international law, this principle of international law is also designed for the benefit of imperialist countries. Because powerful imperialist countries often use retaliatory actions to infringe on the interests of weaker countries. Looking at the history of the use of retaliatory actions, there is not a single instance that is not a strong country dealing with a weak country. Even in recent years, Japan's occupation of the four northeastern provinces and the bombing of Shanghai have also used the principle of retaliation to deceive European and American countries. Therefore, regardless of whether the Spanish government aircraft's bombing of the German warship was due to the German warship's provocation, Germany's exercise of retaliatory action, shelling the port of Almeria, is always an intolerable act of aggression.</p>
<p>Germany's disregard for international law and openly attacking Spain has a very important effect. First, Germany and Italy have been interfering in the Spanish Civil War for more than ten months, and the result is that they have not developed smoothly due to the resolute resistance of the government forces. Therefore, they are taking the initiative to directly challenge to vent their hatred. Second, after the implementation of the international monitoring plan, external assistance to the rebels has been somewhat hindered, especially the recently proposed withdrawal of volunteer soldiers, which is quite detrimental to the rebels. Therefore, they want to use this incident to undermine the implementation of the international monitoring plan and extend the hand of intervention again. This can be seen from the fact that Germany and Italy decided to withdraw from the monitoring plan immediately after this incident occurred. Again, Almeria is an important port on the southern coast of Spain, close to the port of Malaga. Since Malaga was captured by Italian forces in February, the rebels have been advancing towards the port of Almeria. After several months, they have not succeeded. This time, the German warship fired over two hundred rounds, destroying its fortresses, regardless of opening a convenient door for the rebels' subsequent offensive.</p>
<p>In short, the German naval bombardment of Spain is using the name of revenge to carry out the reality of aggression. The increase in the international crisis is, of course, self-evident.</p>
<h3>Konoe Avoids Following Hayashi's Mistakes and Lures Political Parties to Join the Cabinet</h3>
<p>Emphasizes Stability of Extraordinary Finances, Encounters Difficulties in Finding a Successor to the Finance Minister</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After Prince Konoe received the imperial mandate, in view of the seriousness of the current situation, he made his best effort to select cabinet members in order to form a powerful cabinet. According to Prince Konoe's opinion, because the Hayashi cabinet was at odds with the political parties, it led to failure. It is planned to avoid friction with the political parties and actively recruit talents from both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties as cabinet members, and under the support of the military, political parties, and financial circles, a powerful cabinet will be formed. The military originally intended to implement reform policies with Konoe's leadership, so it expressed sympathy for his cabinet formation. The Army officially notified Sugiyama Gen on the evening of the 1st, and the Navy officially notified Yonai Mitsumasa on the morning of the 2nd of their retention, and the important mission of the Konoe cabinet is to establish extraordinary finances, so the selection of the Minister of Finance, the core of the cabinet, is the major key to whether the Konoe cabinet's mission can be implemented. Although there is a saying in some political circles that Finance Minister Yuki will remain in office, Prince Konoe has adopted an extremely cautious attitude towards this statement. As for the relationship with the political parties, he conducted negotiations with Nakajima Chikuhei of the Seiyukai and Nagai Ryutaro of the Minseito on the evening of the 1st to join the cabinet, and plans to conduct formal negotiations with individuals on the 2nd to complete the selection of all cabinet members. (2nd Domei Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prince Konoe arrived at the cabinet formation headquarters from his private residence at 10 a.m. to meet with Osaka Prefectural Governor Yasui Eiji, who arrived in Tokyo this morning, and invited cabinet formation staff member Internal Minister Kawarada to discuss the second step of cabinet formation work. However, regarding the selection of the Minister of Finance, who is responsible for shouldering the heavy responsibility of opening up an unprecedented economic national crisis, it is difficult to discover a suitable person. The retention of Finance Minister Yuki and the re-emergence of Finance Minister Baba both have difficulties and are not easy to realize. Therefore, the cabinet formation work this afternoon will focus on this. As long as this hurdle is broken, it will not be difficult to solve other cabinet members no matter how many twists and turns there are. However, the Minseito and other political parties seem to hold some dissatisfaction with Prince Konoe's attitude towards cabinet formation, and therefore Prince Konoe's originally planned cabinet formation strategy seems to have encountered some obstacles.

<h3>Army and Navy Ministers Remain in Office, Kodama Declines Finance Minister Post</h3>
<p>Kazami Appointed Cabinet Secretary, Yasui Eiji Promoted to Minister of Education</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Because the Finance Minister has not yet been decided, it is difficult to complete the list of remaining cabinet members within the day, and it seems that it may have to be extended to the morning of the 3rd. It is generally expected that the inauguration ceremony will be held on the 3rd. As of 5:30 p.m. today, the names of the confirmed cabinet ministers are as follows: Prime Minister Prince Konoe Fumimaro, Minister of Internal Affairs Baba Eiichi, Minister of the Army Sugiyama Gen, Minister of the Navy Yonai Mitsumasa, Minister of Justice Shiono Suehiko, Minister of Education Yasui Eiji, Minister of Communications Nagai Ryutaro, Minister of Railways Nakajima Chikuhei. It has been internally decided that Hirota Koki will be the Foreign Minister, and Prince Konoe will formally negotiate with him on the 3rd. (2nd Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] Various parties here today are speculating that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito may be appointed as the new cabinet's foreign minister. According to previous information, when Hayashi Senjuro formed his cabinet, he also intended to appoint Mr. Saito as foreign minister, but Mr. Saito declined. (1st Kokumin Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Kodama Kenji, the former President of the Yokohama Specie Bank, who was planned to be appointed as Finance Minister, received an electric invitation from Prince Konoe and immediately went to Tokyo from Okakura. The current President of the bank, Okubo Toshikane, greeted Kodama at Takasaki and asked him to find a way to take office as Finance Minister. Kodama promised to consider it, and then got off the train at Kumagaya Station and changed to a car to go to Tokyo.</p>
<p>Kodama Kenji, who accepted negotiations to take office as Finance Minister, has now politely declined to take office as Finance Minister.</p>
<p>Count Arima Yoriyasu decided to join the cabinet and was appointed as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry. (2nd Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Diet member Kazami Akira has been decided as Cabinet Secretary. Mr. Kazami has jumped from being a member of parliament to being the secretary of the young prime minister. Although he is 52 years old, he is actually a fresh and youthful man full of passion. His attitude is exactly the opposite of Prince Konoe. He is completely a wild fighter, a handsome man with a fierce look on his face. He is from Ibaraki Prefecture and graduated from the Department of Political Science at Waseda University. He once entered the writing world and served as a reporter for the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, the Shinano Mainichi Shimbun, and the Ibaraki Shimbun. His writing was fierce and his arguments were bold, which was widely praised for a time. Later, he changed to the political world and was elected as a member of the House of Representatives four times, from Kokudo to Toho and non-affiliated. Whether in the ideological world, the journalistic world, or the political world, he is a straightforward and clear-headed figure. He and Tachibana Kosaburo of the May 15th Incident were known as close friends who advocated the reform of rural villages with passion. When Tachibana, who was in prison, was granted permission to return home to visit his sick mother, they cried facing each other, showing their beautiful friendship. We still remember this clearly. This time, the new prime minister's appointment of him should be a powerful assistant in realizing his ideals, and all parties are paying close attention. (2nd Domei Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Konoe's Health is Sufficient to Endure Heavy Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Usually Likes Golf, Dislikes Mahjong Battles, Initially an Idealist, Now a Realist</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The health of young Prime Minister Prince Konoe, who bears the burden of a difficult situation, became a reason for resignation when the imperial mandate was issued after the February 26th Incident, which was a concern for the general public. This morning, Dr. Miyakawa Yoneji, the chief physician, examined him and proved that he has a healthy body that can withstand any intense work. He said that his six-foot tall body of twenty kan (each kan is equal to 3.75 kilograms) has the power to deal with the stormy and dangerous political situation.</p>
<p>Konoe Fumimaro's younger brother, the musician Hidemaro, talked about his virtuous brother, saying, "My brother's only hobby is golf. He is not good at Go or Shogi, and he also dislikes mahjong battles. He is almost an amateur in all kinds of entertainment. What he likes is only watching sports and collecting their records. Therefore, he can be said to have an interest in statistics. In addition, he also likes history. For this reason, he likes politics. When he was a student, he was once a private student of Dr. Kawakami Hajime. However, after graduating from university, he entered the House of Peers. Due to the influence of practical politics, he changed from an idealist in the past to a realist. This is my personal observation. Also, like me, he is taciturn and not good at arguing. He is usually very silent and does not talk much, but once he is in parliament, he is eloquent. In addition, one point that is different from ordinary people is that among a hundred Japanese people, almost a hundred people have blood type B, but my brother is the only one with blood type O. Therefore, he often jokes, 'If I get a serious illness one day and need a blood transfusion, it will be a difficult matter.' After agreeing to take responsibility, he will definitely work hard to the end. He is a serious person who does not skimp, but sometimes he also likes humor. For example, at the last wedding of his niece, he held a masquerade party. My brother specially went to Asakusa to buy a fake beard and dressed up as Hitler to appear."</p>
<p>The House of Peers Speaker's official residence, the "delivery room" for the Konoe cabinet, is a national treasure building built when the parliament was established in the 23rd year of Meiji (1890), and Konoe's predecessor, Prince Atsumaro, also lived here for a long time when he was the Speaker of the House of Peers. Konoe's childhood was also spent in this old residence for some time. Bearing the heavy responsibility of dealing with the extraordinary political situation and receiving the expectations of all Japan, Konoe does not know how he feels in this official residence with many memories. In front of the official residence, cars are going back and forth like a tide. Telephone machines and desks are arranged in the room. Today is the second day of cabinet formation. From early morning, staff members such as Kawarada Kazuo and Goto Ryutaro gathered at the western desk on the second floor and began to discuss in secret. However, what is different from the cabinet formation scenery in the past is that there are no large-scale gifts or large sake barrels for drunkness, and there is a sense of loneliness. However, Konoe's personality can be seen from this. (2nd Domei Dispatch)</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative Denounces Japan's Drug Policy in China</h3>
<p>Says That Those Who Do Many Evils Will Eventually Be Condemned by Heaven, Praises China's Opium Suppression Achievements</p>
<p>[Geneva] At today's meeting of the Advisory Committee on Opium, the U.S. representative, Fuller, strongly denounced Japan's opium policy in North China with extremely harsh words, which was unprecedented. Fuller first praised the Chinese government's sincere and effective efforts to eradicate opium, saying that opium production in Henan and Sichuan provinces had decreased by 50%. He then said that Manchuria was different. The area for poppy cultivation increased by 17%, and the income from poppy cultivation tax also increased by 28%. Furthermore, the amount of Iranian opium imported into Manchuria for the manufacture of morphine and heroin seems to be increasing day by day, which is in obvious conflict with the provisions of the Narcotics Convention. It is estimated that at least 40 to 50 tons of Iranian opium are now imported into Manchuria annually, which is enough to make four to five times more heroin than the world's medical and scientific needs. Hebei Province has become the world's largest site for the illegal manufacture of heroin. The situation in Beijing, Tianjin, and eastern Hebei is extremely appalling and beyond description. Those who do evil will eventually be condemned, and the ill-gotten wealth will not be able to avoid it. However, before they are condemned, it remains to be seen whether those responsible for the general living dead in Harbin, Shenyang, Tangshan, and Beijing will restrain themselves.

At the same time, it was stated here that the U.S. envoys abroad have not been ordered to engage with any country regarding the Spanish affair, as Hull believes that this matter is of utmost importance and must be handled personally. Yesterday, Senator Borah advocated implementing the U.S. Neutrality Act, while Senator Johnson today expressed opposition, stating that there is no need for implementation at present, and that the U.S. should not participate with its opinions. However, in the House of Representatives, Representative O’Connell has proposed that President Roosevelt declare that Germany and Italy have opened hostilities with Spain, and that the U.S. should immediately implement the provisions of the Neutrality Act against Germany and Italy.

<p>[London] The London Non-Intervention Committee is working to find a way to satisfy Germany's demand for guarantees that the "Deutschland" warship incident will not happen again, and there is now an atmosphere of optimism. Britain and France are currently urging Germany and Italy to return to the Non-Intervention Committee. Suggestions that have been agreed upon, such as expanding the security zones for patrolling warships, will be immediately communicated by British Foreign Secretary Eden to countries that have objections. Although Germany and Italy have withdrawn from the Non-Intervention Committee, they are still adhering to the Non-Intervention Agreement. Based on news from Paris, Rome, and Berlin today, the tense situation has greatly eased. The Spanish Ambassador to the U.S. delivered a document to U.S. Secretary of State Hull protesting the German warship's bombardment of Almería port.

<h3>Britain and France Reach Agreement on the Safety of Surveillance Ships</h3>
<p>Content of German Demands; Portuguese Government Expresses Support</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the international situation caused by Germany and Italy withdrawing from the London Adjustment Committee and refusing to continue participating in maritime surveillance work, diplomatic circles here are now more optimistic. It is said that the British and French governments have reached an agreement on the issue of safety guarantees for warships from various countries engaged in surveillance. At the same time, they hope that Germany will not demand compensation from the Spanish Republican government. As for the rumor that Italy will rejoin the Adjustment Committee even before its warships receive safety guarantees, Italian sources here have denied it. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] Responsible officials recently confirmed that the central government intends to negotiate with both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, striving to ensure that they comply with the outline of requirements put forward by Germany to protect the safety of foreign warships participating in surveillance work. Germany's demands were submitted by German Foreign Minister Neurath to the British and French Ambassadors to Germany, and also presented to Foreign Secretary Eden this afternoon by German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop. Foreign Secretary Eden agreed with the views expressed by Ribbentrop, but because France and Italy have not yet accepted them, he only listened and did not take a formal stance. The contents of the German plan include three points: ㊀ Warships from various countries engaged in surveillance work should be collectively responsible, in other words, if a warship from one country is attacked, warships from other countries should jointly bear the responsibility for its safety. ㊁ Warships from various countries engaged in surveillance work have the right to sail into any Spanish port and may anchor at will. ㊂ If a warship from a country participating in surveillance work is attacked, warships from all countries should jointly respond to the attack. In addition, it is heard that Foreign Secretary Eden expressed to Ribbentrop his hope that Germany would not cause any new incidents, so that the international situation would not worsen, and that countries opposed to Germany, such as the Soviet Union, would not become more justified. Ribbentrop replied that Germany does not intend to cause any new incidents, but that warships from various countries engaged in surveillance work must form a joint relationship. He said that the issue of the safety of warships can only be negotiated and resolved by the navies of Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, and cannot be resolved by the Non-Intervention Adjustment Committee, because the Adjustment Committee includes the Soviet Union. It is now heard that the British government will probably submit the German safety plan to the Adjustment Committee for discussion after it has received the support of France and Italy, and then present it to the countries concerned for final acceptance. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>⊙Lisbon The government today sent a document to the Non-Intervention Committee, supporting the claims of Germany and Italy that warships engaged in maritime surveillance should have guarantees against attack. However, it stated that the Portuguese government does not abandon the Non-Intervention Committee, but declares reservations regarding the attitude of the inspectors stationed on the Portuguese border and in Portuguese seaports. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding Germany's proposed plan that warships from all countries engaged in surveillance work on the Spanish seas should assist each other, French officials recently stated that this can only be considered if two conditions are attached: ㊀ Warships from various countries engaged in surveillance work outside Spanish territorial waters may be assisted by warships from other countries if they encounter danger. ㊁ Warships from various countries may only enjoy the right of mutual assistance if they encounter danger while performing surveillance work. Regarding this, the German pocket battleship "Deutschland" did not meet these conditions when it was bombed recently, so it should be treated separately. For the sake of learning from the past, the best way is to ensure that warships from various countries engaged in surveillance work are not allowed to sail into Spanish ports. Designated ports outside Spain can be considered safe zones, and they should be ordered to go there to anchor. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 1st)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Spanish government had intended to request the League of Nations to take strong action regarding the bombing of Almería port, but due to the advice of Britain and France to be tolerant, the matter was dropped. The Spanish chief representative to the League of Nations, Álvarez del Vayo, knows that the League of Nations Executive Council will not convene a special meeting and plans to move to Paris to lobby. It is heard that Britain has notified Álvarez del Vayo that Germany has announced that it will no longer carry out retaliation, so it would be unwise to demand anti-German action. However, the Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War is prepared to receive Álvarez del Vayo's protest, and Britain and France have suggested establishing a safety zone on the Spanish coast for foreign warships to anchor.

<p>Pacific Non-Aggression Pact Issue; Australian Representative Proposes Concrete Measures</p>
<p>[London] At the Imperial Conference held at 10 Downing Street this morning, Foreign Secretary Eden gave a further statement on the Spanish situation, followed by a discussion of the situation in the Pacific and the Far East. Australian Prime Minister Lyons initiated the discussion of this issue. The Australian delegation issued a detailed declaration, proposing several concrete measures for the recently suggested Pacific Pact. Representatives from other countries spoke in succession. It is heard that the issue will be brought up for discussion again before the end of the conference. Roughly, after the Imperial Conference ends, the British government will conduct a detailed discussion with the various autonomous territories. Therefore, there will be no arbitrary decision in the near future. However, what can be said at present is that there has definitely been considerable progress on this matter. Furthermore, the Imperial Conference, by its nature, is not an Imperial Cabinet meeting, so the current negotiations are only exploratory in nature.

<h3>In the Drought-Stricken Western Henan, Famine Victims Desperately Hope for Relief</h3>
<p>Selling Wives and Daughters, Cries Everywhere; Whole Families Perish While Fleeing</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: In recent years, Henan has suffered repeated disasters. First, there was the ravaging of the Red Spears Society, which murdered, set fires, raped, and looted. Then, the Yellow River caused harm, and tens of thousands of people along the river became victims again. Unexpectedly, closely following were drought demons and hurricane devils. The severity of the situation exceeds the disaster in Shaanxi in the 20th year of the Republic (1931) by more than ten times. Among the more than ninety counties affected by the disaster, more than forty counties are barren wastelands, devoid of the sounds of chickens and dogs, truly a hell on earth.</p>
<p>Yichuan, Mianchi, Mengjin, and Shanzhou are the counties most severely affected by the disaster among the more than forty counties in western Henan. These counties are surrounded by mountains on all sides, with overlapping peaks, originally the haunts of bandits. Although internal banditry has been cleared since 1933, external bandits continue to harass, leaving nothing in their wake. Bandits such as Cui Erdan and Liu Yulai appear and disappear unpredictably. The army's patrolling and encirclement have invisibly increased the burden on the people. The local area is corrupt, and the residents are fleeing, supporting the old and carrying the young, crying of hunger and cold, which is a common phenomenon. Under these circumstances, unexpectedly, drought has arrived. From last summer to winter, not a drop of rain was seen. The spring wheat is less than 20%, and cotton yields only a few catties per mu. After the people's panic and thirst, they hoped that this year's wheat harvest could make up for it. Unfortunately, since the beginning of spring, not a single drop has fallen. The hurricane on April 11, the hail on the 14th, followed by severe frost, turned the remaining wheat seedlings from green to yellow, and from yellow to withered. As a result, there is no surviving grain in the fields, and no grass can be dug from the ground. Houses have collapsed, and epidemics are rampant. The emaciated and haggard famine victims are everywhere. One often sees corpses with bared teeth and bloated bellies lying on the main roads. In areas that were relatively wealthy in the past, tree bark and grass roots have been stripped and eaten. Bran and chaff are the landlord's exclusive grain, and white soil and stone powder are the food of the common people. Famine victims who eat stones to fill their stomachs or mistakenly eat poisonous grasses all have red eyes, swollen necks, and bloated chests and abdomens. Within half a month, they moan and collapse. The young and strong are unwilling to starve to death and often commit suicide or murder. The old and weak, in addition to hanging themselves or jumping into wells, have no choice but to wait for death. The most tragic and heart-wrenching thing is the selling of women and the abandonment of infants. Because famine victims have run out of food and are completely exhausted, they sell their wives and daughters to use the money obtained to survive or to pay for their escape. At the time of sale, they openly grade and price the women. Those with better looks, aged seventeen, eighteen, or in their twenties, can be bought for ten to twenty yuan at most. After the agreement is reached, cries and scoldings arise together. Small children pull at their mother's clothes, and the elderly wail and call for their children. Husbands and fathers sob and swallow their tears, letting the buyers tie them up and take them away. It is said that many of the women who are sold are transported to the Yangzhou and Zhenjiang areas. As for the abandoned infants, most of them are three, four months old or half a year old. They are thrown on the corners of walls or by the side of the road, crying loudly and incessantly until midnight. The next morning, they starve to death on the ground.</p>
<p>According to recent reports from various sources, famine victims have reached the end of their rope, and thousands are fleeing every day. Women and the old and weak often succumb to hunger and exhaustion and collapse halfway. Crows peck at their flesh. The situation is extremely tragic. In a certain village, a strong man surnamed Zhao, with a family of four, unable to bear starvation, took his wife and two children to flee. The eldest son was six years old, and the youngest was only four. The husband carried the luggage ahead, and the wife led the two children behind, less than half a li apart. The two children, exhausted and hungry, cried and begged for food, refusing to move forward. After countless persuations, the wife, in desperation, took scissors from the basket and plunged them into her throat, cutting her trachea. She collapsed in a pool of blood. Seeing this, the two children cried loudly. The husband returned and also wailed in despair. He then picked up the two children and threw them into the valley, and jumped into the well himself. A family of several people perished in an instant. Stories like this are too numerous to mention, and they are all lamentable.</p>
<p>After repeated calls for relief, it has aroused the serious attention of government authorities. At the same time, after great philanthropists from Shanghai, such as Lu Bohong and Zhu Ziqiao, came to Henan for inspection, they decided to send personnel with funds to provide disaster relief. The Shanghai Charity Federation's Henan Drought Disaster Investigation and Relief Office was therefore established, and Vice Director Li Shaohua presided over the relief work in Henan. They borrowed a portion of the Catholic Church's building as the office site and, after brief preparations, began work.</p>
<p>Before the work of the Charity Federation began, the Kaifeng Provincial Relief Committee was already carrying out relief work. For the same purpose, they adopted a method of collective efforts and cooperated with each other. Thus, after a joint meeting on April 6, the Henan relief work began in earnest.</p>
<p>The source of funds comes from three places. In addition to the 100,000 yuan exclusively provided by the Shanghai Charity Federation, which has been successively remitted, the central and provincial governments have jointly allocated 600,000 yuan, totaling 700,000 yuan. After deducting 100,000 yuan for work relief, the remaining 600,000 yuan is distributed to the forty counties most severely affected by the disaster. However, due to the severity of the disaster and the large number of famine victims, the mere 700,000 yuan is like a drop in the bucket.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned relief work, there are also local philanthropists who have privately established relief organizations, such as Guo Fangwu, the director of the Xingdu Charity Orphanage, who has set up congee kitchens capable of accommodating 11,000 people, and the women's relief centers set up by Catholic churches in various places, all of which are providing relief. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties, the congee kitchens were suspended after being supported for a short time, and the tens of thousands of famine victims who were barely able to survive have become wailing crows again. Therefore, the relief of the famine victims in western Henan at present is truly urgent and cannot be delayed. (May 31st)</p>
<h3>City of Beijing Government Holds Tenth Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>Mayor Ma Reports on Ten Years of Municipal Administration - Central National Government Representatives Deliver Encouragement Speeches - Celebrations to Continue for Three Days Starting from the First</p>
<p>Nanjing Dispatch, This month's first day marks the tenth anniversary of the founding of the capital's municipal government. The municipal government is holding a commemorative celebration, lasting for three days. Prior arrangements were made by Mayor Ma, who dispatched Councilor Zhang Jianming to oversee the preparations, and everything was meticulously arranged. The details of the commemorative celebration are recorded below:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>The Municipal Government's Tenth Anniversary Celebration was held in the Municipal Government Auditorium. The interior and exterior were exquisitely decorated with paper flowers and lanterns. Many police officers were assigned to maintain order. At 9:00 AM, officials and guests from various agencies attended. These included representatives from: the Central Party Headquarters, Ye Chucang; the National Government, Zhu Wenzhong; the Executive Yuan, Zhang Rui; the Legislative Yuan, Liang Hancao; the Shanghai Municipal Government, Zhou Yongneng; the Ministry of Interior, Zhang Daofan; the Ministry of Finance, Xu Kan; the Ministry of Education, Lei Zhen; the Audit Department, Liu Jiwen; the Training Directorate-General, Wu Huafan; the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Jiang Yangzheng; the National Central University, Luo Jialun; the Gendarmerie Headquarters, Gu Zhenglun; the Capital Police Department, Wang Gu Pan; the New Life Movement Promotion Association, Yan Binhang; the Municipal Party Headquarters, Liu Baimin and Peng Erkang; as well as Xiao Qin, Wang Zhaopeng, Wu Zhenxiu, Jiao Yitang, Wang Shumei, Di Ying, Wang Fang, Zheng Hongnian, Li Qingsong, Lu Cangyan, Sun Yafu, Wu Shikun, Huang Qibi, Luo Naizhai, Tang Xiaozhai, Chen Yinji, and over two hundred others. They were received by Mayor Ma Chaojun and Secretary-General Wang Shufang.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>At 9:30 AM, over two hundred officials, guests, and municipal government staff members were seated in order. The meeting began with Mayor Ma serving as chairman and delivering an opening address, providing a brief report on the municipal construction of Nanjing over the past ten years. He stated, "Today, we are holding the tenth anniversary celebration of the municipal government's founding. I am deeply grateful to the central government officials, guests from various sectors, and colleagues for attending. At this time of national crisis, we dare not simply celebrate. However, it has been ten years since our party established the capital in Nanjing. Celebrating during a time of national crisis can serve as a catalyst for future endeavors. Regarding the municipal government's facilities over the past ten years, there is a lack of commendable achievements to report. However, in recent years, the municipal government, following the grand plans of previous mayors, has been advancing areas such as education, public training, relief, small loans, labor services, the New Life Movement, as well as finance, public works, and land administration. At all times, we have been diligently working under the leadership of the central government and the supervision of various sectors, hoping to promote and enhance them. However, the municipal government's tenth anniversary is like a ten-year-old child. Everything still requires the assistance of seniors to ensure its health. I would like to take this celebration opportunity to ask central government officials and local leaders to provide timely advice, so that the municipal government can follow it to achieve the goal of completing the capital's construction."</p>
<p>Central Government Instruction</p>
<p>Subsequently, Ye Chucang, representing the Central Party Headquarters, delivered an address, stating, "Time flies, and another ten years have passed in an instant. Looking back to the beginning of the establishment of the Nanjing Municipal Government, I came to participate in the founding ceremony. Before I knew it, ten years had passed. Thinking about it brings endless emotions. It makes me feel the rapid passage of time and the necessity of striving for duties. Only through hard work and service can we keep up with the times. I just heard Mayor Ma's report and learned that the municipal administration's achievements are remarkable. This is the reality of working hard to keep up with the times. Time passes too quickly, making us feel the preciousness of time and the inadequacy of ten short years. These achievements are enough to comfort the citizens of the entire city and the people of the entire country. The people of the entire country know that it is not easy to achieve such results under such difficult circumstances. We should continue to work hard and achieve even greater results. The implementation of municipal administration relies on two forces: one is the citizens' contributions, and the other is the government's hard work. No facility is not created by the citizens' money and the government's efforts. Therefore, for the achievement of every matter and object, citizens should not forget the government's hard work, and at the same time, the government should not forget the citizens' contributions. The government's hard work can be deeply understood by the citizens, and the citizens will definitely increase their faith in the government and put forth even more</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>greater strength to assist the government. The citizens' contributions can be deeply understood by the government, and the government will put forth even greater strength to seek greater happiness for the citizens. Therefore, these two forces encourage each other and stimulate each other. If one force is lax, the other force will also be slackened. Nanjing City has achieved these results over the past ten years, and it must be attributed to the results of the joint efforts of the orders and the citizens. When foreigners investigate Chinese customs, they often cannot travel to remote and impoverished villages. Therefore, seeing the customs of the capital is seeing the customs of all of China, and seeing the spirit of the capital's people is seeing the spirit of all of China. If everything in the capital truly amazes and praises foreigners, then even if the achievements of other provinces and cities are slightly worse, foreigners will have the same perception. Otherwise, even if the achievements of other provinces are better, it will be impossible for foreigners to believe. From this point, we can see that the progress of the capital has a significant impact on China's international status. The capital of a country is often prone to luxury. Nanjing City has also had this trend recently. However, one thing is worth noting: the city orders are still working in dilapidated old houses. This spirit can be described as prioritizing the people's welfare over the grandeur of the palace. I congratulate the municipal government, which is better than being under a magnificent building. However, it must be stated that I do not want the municipal government to build a large building forever, but building a new municipal building is the second thing. All construction outside the gate of the municipal government is the first major event and must be built first. What I said above can be said to be my congratulatory remarks, or it can be said to be my humble words of encouragement to everyone."</p>
<p>National Government Instruction</p>
<p>Subsequently, Zhu Wenzhong, representing the National Government, delivered an address, stating, "The rapid progress and great achievements of Nanjing City over the past ten years have been witnessed and heard by all of us. The reason why Nanjing City has made such rapid progress and great achievements is due to the efforts of the municipal authorities in the past, the efforts of all citizens, and the cooperation between the citizens and the municipal government. We firmly believe that the municipal government and the citizens will continue to work hard in the future, and there will definitely be greater progress and greater achievements in five or ten years. At the same time, we hope that Nanjing City can truly become a model for municipal administration in the country, and the citizens of Nanjing can truly become a model for the people of the country." Subsequently, Zhang Rui, representing the Executive Yuan, Liu Baimin, a member of the Municipal Party Committee, Liu Jiwen, the Vice Minister of the Audit Department, Zhang Daofan, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Interior, Gu Zhenglun, the Commander of the Garrison, Wang Gu Pan, the Director of the Police Department, and Zhou Yongneng, the representative of the Shanghai Municipal Government, delivered speeches one after another. At 12:00, the ceremony ended and everyone took a group photo to commemorate the occasion.</p>
<p>Regarding the celebration activities on that day, at 2:00 PM, a chess competition was held in the Municipal Government Auditorium, open to the public. By 1:30 PM, all the seats were filled, and those who arrived later stood around to watch, creating a lively atmosphere. The participants were divided into three groups: A, B, and C. At 4:00 PM, the Mother's Association organized by the Health Office held an enlarged amusement fair in the First Park. More than 1,200 members attended. Twenty members of the</p>
<p>Lequn Girls' High School Labor Service Group participated in the service. First, a doctor from the Health Office gave a lecture on hygiene knowledge, and then the garden party began. At 5:00 PM, the municipal government hosted officials from various central government agencies and foreign guests at the International Club. Among those present were Feng Yuxiang, the Vice Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration, Wang Zhaohui, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wei Daoming, the Acting Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Liu Jiwen, the Vice Minister of the Audit Department, and over two hundred foreign guests from various embassies and consulates. They were personally received by Mayor Ma, who presented various publications of the municipal government to the officials and guests. The event concluded at 7:00 PM. That evening, a lantern parade was held, initiated by various sectors of the capital. 14,000 people participated with 7,000 lanterns. The parade began at 6:30 PM, gathering at the Public Stadium, with orderly arrangements. The area around the Public Stadium was extremely crowded with spectators. At 7:00 PM, thousands of lanterns were lit up, illuminating the sky, creating a very beautiful sight. A police and gendarmerie team led the parade. At the same time, various sectors of Xiaguan also held a lantern festival to celebrate together, with over 4,000 participants and 2,000 lanterns, creating an extraordinarily lively atmosphere.</p>
<p>The celebration program for the other two days included: On the morning of the 2nd, at 8:00 AM, a grand review of social training students, juvenile corps, and women's team members was held at the airfield. From 1:00 PM to 12:00 PM, a public entertainment event for citizens was held at the Public Stadium, with a stage set up for various performances. From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the municipal government hosted a tea party for news reporters in Beijing at the municipal government. At 7:00 PM, municipal government staff members held a dinner gathering at the Pacific and Liu Hua Chun restaurants. On the morning of the 3rd, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM, a sports competition between representative teams from Beijing was held at the Public Stadium. From 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM, municipal government staff members held a garden party at Xuanwu Lake Park. From 7:30 PM to 12:00 PM, municipal government staff members held an entertainment gathering at the Central Grand Stage. In addition, a municipal exhibition is planned to be held on July 1st at the Art Exhibition Hall of the National Assembly Hall, and preparations are actively underway.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Competing to Build the Su-Dong Highway</p>
<p>The Su-Dong Highway from Suzhou to Dongting East Mountain starts from the Huodong Station and passes through Lingering Garden, West Garden, Feng Bridge, Hanshan Temple, Xijin Bridge, Tianping Mountain, Da Yu, Jinshan Sect, Hengjing, Dukun Village, and Dongting East Mountain, including the scenic line of the western suburbs of Wu County. Previously, the Su-Fu Long-Distance Bus Company first initiated the construction of the Su-Dong Highway and was in the process of operating long-distance buses. At the same time, local figures from Dongshan and Mudu, such as Wang Shujie and Jiang Zhongchuan, organized the Su-Dong Highway Long-Distance Bus Company, raising 300,000 yuan. Jiang Bainian and others have been appointed as road survey committee members to start surveying and have applied to the Construction Department for recordation. The progress is very active and may become a reality. However, the initiators of the company, such as Fan Junbo, are all directors of the Su-Fu Company, so some people advocate that the two companies cooperate in handling the matter, which would be more convenient. However, due to various reasons, the hope is very small.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Shenxin Textile Angora Rabbit Wool</p>
<p>Since Xue Mingjian, the director of the general management office of Shenxin No. 3 Factory in this county, advocated raising wool rabbits, more and more people in the county have been raising them in recent years. Recently, Hu Minghu, the director of the labor autonomous region of the factory, purchased several East and West Angora rabbit wool spinning machines. Tu Zhaoxiang was invited to the factory to guide the spinning methods, and Yuan Tingjie and others, who were familiar with this project, repeatedly improved them with the assistance of the engineering director Zheng Jingde. Recently, several of the most suitable Angora rabbit wool spinning machines have been invented. Dozens of machines have been set up in the district for female workers on rotating shifts to learn, so that they can make a living after retiring in their old age. In addition to using self-raised rabbit wool, the district also purchases rabbit wool from the outside world, worth 800 yuan per picul.</p>
<p>Situation of Cocoon Shops Opening</p>
<p>The cocoon shops in the urban and rural areas of this county uniformly opened on the first day, with varying cocoon prices. Yu Yuan and Nanchang, two shops in Nanlu Nanjiao, received 40 to 50 piculs of goods, with a cocoon price of 45 yuan. Dacheng and Dachang, two shops in Zhongqiao, received more than 40 piculs of goods, with a high cocoon price of 45 yuan. In Donglu, the arrival of goods at Yichang, Chengtai, and Qinyi in Dongting was not enthusiastic, with a cocoon price of 45 to 45 yuan. Fuyuan in Xintangqiao received more than 30 piculs of goods, with a price of 47 yuan. Cocoon shops in areas such as Sitou, Zhangcun, Anzhen, and Guting Temple in Beilu have also opened, with a cocoon price of 40 yuan. In areas such as Qianzhou, Yuqi, Beiqifang, and Lishe in Xilu, the high-quality goods are 40 yuan, and the second-quality goods are 37 yuan. Generally, farmers are unwilling to sell once due to the high cost, so they are waiting for a good price.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Strict Punishment of Litigation Mongers in Tong Prefecture</p>
<p>The wind of litigation has been rampant in various counties of Tong Prefecture recently. The judicial organs and administrative offices are jointly investigating and arresting litigation mongers. In order to achieve practical results, the Baojia system is used to report and severely punish them. The courts of various counties and the county governments concurrently handling judicial affairs have established writing offices.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Spring Cocoons Begin to Appear on the Market</p>
<p>The Wu County Cocoon Industry Association convened a general meeting of all members on June 1st, deciding that the opening date would be the 2nd. The price of fresh cocoons will be based on 37 yuan as the standard according to the law. However, the spring cocoons in the county have already appeared on the market early. Xie Tongyi Firm in Qishuyan received goods on the 1st and immediately opened the scale to purchase, receiving more than ten piculs of improved varieties, with a price of 39 yuan. Henglin Cocoon Firm also opened the scale one day earlier, with a price of around 40 yuan. On the 2nd, all cocoon shops in the county opened the scale uniformly, and the arrival of goods will be crowded, and there will be a formal market. In addition, Zhou Jixian, a technician from the Jiangsu Provincial Silkworm Vegetable Improvement Management Committee, visited Changzhou on the 1st to inspect the silkworm breeding guidance centers in Puqian Town and other places, and then returned to the province to report.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Ninth District Jumping Locusts Are Massively Active</p>
<p>Jumping locusts have occurred in the lakes and fields under the jurisdiction of the Ninth District west of Shaobo Lake in Jiangdu County, covering an area of approximately 40 acres. Ouyang Jianxiu, the captain of the Huangjueqiao Bao'an Branch of the district, noticed it and reported it to Magistrate Ma. Upon receiving the order, he was ordered to jointly supervise and direct the district chief to mobilize the entire district to work hard to eliminate them. On the 1st, the county also telegraphed to the district chiefs, stating that since it is early summer and the jumping locusts are taking the opportunity to move, if precautions are not taken in advance, even if the spread is avoided, the damage will be avoided. They were ordered to invite past locust prevention methods and supervise the township and village chiefs under their jurisdiction to conduct detailed inspections in areas such as lake shores and shallow seas in the district's territory. If there are jumping locusts, they should be eliminated immediately and report the compliance situation at any time.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Wool Factory Loan to Start</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government Bureau is developing the wool weaving industry and is preparing to set up a wool factory with three departments: spinning, weaving, and dyeing. The address is planned to be in Xiaoshan. The capital has now been determined to be 2.4 million yuan, with German merchants investing one-third, totaling 800,000 yuan. The provincial government is responsible for 1.6 million yuan, of which 1.2 million yuan will be used to purchase machinery from German merchants, with an annual interest of 40,000 yuan. 300 to 400 locomotives are pre-ordered. A detailed plan has been drafted and the Construction Department has hired experts to organize a technical research conference to review it. The loan agreement is scheduled to be signed and established on the 5th of this month, and the purchase of machinery and construction will begin. It is expected to start construction within ten years.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Police Kill Road Worker</p>
<p>Liu Xiaowu, a policeman from the Jiaxing Xinzhuding Police Station, was splashed with mud on his pants by a road construction worker next to the highway at around 5:00 PM on the 31st, which caused a dispute. Liu immediately returned to the station to report. Inspector Huang Chengzhang took a gun dog and went to the dispute site, which caused the situation to escalate. In the evening, the police suddenly fired more than 30 shots. Road worker He Mengjiang was killed by a bullet, and three or four other workers were injured by stray bullets. In addition, many stray bullets hit the Dai Longchang coffin shop, but fortunately no one was injured. As a result, the road workers clashed with the police, seizing two guns. Inspector Huang Chengzhang, policemen Wu Qinglong, Liu Xiaowu, Liu Qianghuang, and Zhou Lixian were also injured. That night, Xie Ruchang, the chief of the Public Security Section, heard the news and led the police to deal with it on the 2nd. The chief prosecutor of the Japanese court also went to examine the body. It is also heard that the people there are quite dissatisfied with the police for causing such a big case due to such a trivial matter.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Strictly Urging the Collection of One Household Donation</p>
<p>The Yinxian County Government is facing a dilemma because the collection of autonomous household donations in various townships is short, which has caused the township government's finances to be in a difficult situation. In addition, the county treasury is empty and unable to raise funds. A meeting was held for the supervisors of the Baojia system in each district, the standing committee members of the district loan production association, and the directors of the household donation collection to discuss and decide to continue to strictly urge the collection.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the June 3rd Commemoration</h3>
<p>— Chen Lingyun</p>
<p>Today marks the 98th anniversary of Lin Wenzhong's destruction of opium at Humen, which caused international disputes, resulting in the cession of land and indemnity, and opened the precedent of unequal treaties in our country, leaving a warning and painful commemoration for future generations. We, descendants, recalling the martyrs, have something that we cannot help but say in addition to admiration and emotion.</p>
<p>The import of opium into our country has a long history. Since the failure of the torch at Humen, foreigners have succeeded and intensified their efforts. Afterwards, it became deeply rooted and could not be cleaned up. The Qing court was confused and dismissed Wenzhong and two or three ignorant princes and ministers to manage the matter. They sought temporary peace, forgot the real harm, humiliated the country and sought complete accommodation. The international status plummeted. In the Xian, Tong, Guang, and Xuan dynasties, it created the idea that rich and dignified families used opium smoking as a way for their children to preserve their inheritance, and corrupt officials used opium smoking to invigorate their work spirit. The superiors and inferiors colluded with each other, and the nation declined day by day. It hurts to talk about it!</p>
<p>Since the Prime Minister founded the Republic of China, he has identified opium as a public enemy of the country, continued the efforts of his predecessors, and worked hard to ban opium. Unfortunately, the warlords were rampant for a short time, and the prohibition was imposed on the expedition to fill the military. The warlords were even more indulgent and arrogant in selling opium. At that time, the soldiers were violent and arrogant. In addition to selling, most of them were addicted to opium themselves. Therefore, there was a saying in the army at that time: "One person, two guns." The government's ban was sometimes strict and sometimes slack, and it was exposed for ten days. There was no success to speak of. The Republic of China was rebuilt, and the revolutionary army settled the entire territory. It was only then that they devoted themselves to opium prohibition. The Director-General also followed the Prime Minister's anti-drug instructions, continued the unfinished work of the sages, and took the responsibility of hard work and perseverance as his own. They determined a planned and systematic two-year drug ban and six-year opium ban policy, reversing the previous policy of strictness and relaxation. With a successful plan in mind, they set a deadline for effectiveness. Officials and people, superiors and subordinates, all abided by it. Therefore, in recent years, from the national party, military, political, and public officials, there has been no opium addiction. It has been promoted to the point where all conscious people in the country know that opium smoking is the most shameful behavior and the most lowly hobby. The effects are becoming more and more obvious, and the atmosphere is new. We are rejoicing and encouraged, knowing that the light of the future is promising and the revival of the country is hopeful.</p>
<p>However, the above-mentioned achievements in opium prohibition are only for the areas that can be reached by our country's policies. In the special areas or foreign concessions where our country's policies cannot be reached, there are still wicked people who have no national concept and are willing to degenerate, relying on foreign forces to escape punishment. They still need our country's government and officials who are responsible for opium prohibition to make the final effort to seek the implementation of the opium prohibition policy. In recent years, the Director-General's painstaking efforts in opium prohibition have been highly praised by the League of Nations, and the authorities of various concessions have gradually been able to understand our country's determination to thoroughly ban opium, and have unanimously expressed their spirit of assistance. The view that opium smokers and opium criminals used to take the concessions as a talisman has gradually changed, and they deeply know that once the policies of the Chinese districts and special districts are consistent, they will be responsible for their no way to survive, and they are all afraid. In the future, the implementation of the ban will not be difficult to achieve in one fell swoop. In the past, the failure of the opium ban in the concessions was mainly due to the inconsistency of policies, and the general public's lack of self-improvement and the formation of today's abnormal situation due to incorrect views also had a significant relationship. Since the concessions are no longer willing to protect our country's opium criminals, and the opium criminals can change their thinking, the future of opium prohibition is particularly optimistic.</p>
<p>In addition, it is not difficult to ban opium like never before, but it is difficult to prevent it from happening again. All local governments that handle opium prohibition should continue to remember opium prohibition after the completion of the six-year opium ban policy, and continue to prevent it indefinitely. It will not stop until the people of the whole country are permanently aware and naturally disappear without borrowing the ban, so that they can show the strength of the country and the nation and live up to the efforts of the sages to ban opium.</p>
<h3>Anti-Smoking and National Salvation</h3>
<p>— Yu Hongjun</p>
<p>In recent years, people in our country, from the government to the common people, are alarmed by the crisis of the nation and constantly speak of saving the country and think of saving the country. This is indeed a sign of the revival of our nation. However, there are many ways to save the country, and banning opium is the most urgent. Saving the country requires strength, which can be divided into four categories: physical, intellectual, mental, and financial. These involve training, education, production, and construction, as well as all other government measures and various social activities, all of which are focused on the creation and accumulation of these four types of strength, so that our people can bear the heavy responsibilities they should bear in the future! However, if we create on one hand and destroy on the other, accumulate on one hand and consume on the other, even after a hundred years of hard work, we will still be the same as before. What good will that do for saving the country? Moreover, other people's creation is becoming more urgent, and their accumulation is becoming wider. Even if we work diligently day and night, putting in ten times the effort of others, we are still afraid that we will not be able to overcome the national crisis and prolong the life of the nation. How can we tolerate further destruction and consumption? And opium is the stubborn enemy of these four original driving forces for saving the country! Therefore, if opium is not banned, not only will there be no funds to raise, but also no soldiers to train. A hundred years ago, Lord Lin Zexu had already lamented this point. Recently, in the instructions of Chiang Kai-shek, he also said that "If the ban on opium cannot be effective, all other political construction work, no matter how hard we try, will not be effective." Indeed, if the scourge of opium cannot be eradicated, all strength will be eroded. Fundamentally, the country cannot be saved. Our people may not fully understand the harm of opium to their bodies, or may not know the harm of opium to the country in detail. However, those who smoke opium refuse to quit, or use the excuse that they cannot quit, perhaps because they think that the harm of opium is not so great. All of this shows that they do not understand the law of cause and effect, and the relationship between an individual and a country. Taking this June 3rd Commemoration as an opportunity, Hongjun, in accordance with the decree of the central government and President Chiang, respectfully tells our people that the relationship between banning opium and saving the country cannot be separated.</p>
<p>The most common and most serious problem of our people lies in the word "laziness." Once the thought of laziness arises, one pretends to know what one does not know, and pretends to do what one has not done. As a result, one does everything perfunctorily and carelessly, just getting by, without seeking thoroughness. Gradually, it becomes difficult to be energetic and one loses a sense of shame. And humans are most prone to imitation. No matter how strong a person's personality is, they cannot avoid the influence of contact and temptation, which gradually and subtly change them. Thus, if one person is lazy, the whole family is lazy, and the whole country is lazy. Eventually, they do not know to worry when the country is broken, and do not know to save themselves when their lives are in danger. They live shamelessly, seeking to prolong their remaining breath. The reason why our country is lagging behind in everything today and suffering all kinds of humiliation is all due to the word "laziness." And smoking opium is most likely to increase the thought of laziness and cultivate lazy habits. Opium flowed into our country starting in the Tang Dynasty, but the prevalence of smoking began in the Chongzhen period of the late Ming Dynasty. Our nation also declined after the Tang Dynasty, and became increasingly backward in the Song Dynasty. From this, we should be able to understand the harm of opium! Now, the whole country is thinking about saving the country. Saving the country requires four strengths: physical, intellectual, mental, and financial, as mentioned above. So how can we enrich these four types of strength? In a word, "ban opium!" If opium is not banned for a single day, these four types of strength cannot be enriched for a single day. Now, I will further elaborate on the reasons as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Opium is the great enemy of destroying physical strength. If we want to save the country, we must ban opium. Opium can numb the heart, destroy the blood vessels, weaken the muscles and bones, and deplete vital energy, which is almost universally known. Therefore, those who smoke it are all slumped and emaciated, weak and decadent, and always in a state of drowsiness. What day is today? What time is now? The government and society are focusing all their efforts on cultivating and training the physical strength of the people, in order to enable each individual to bear the responsibility of saving the country when necessary, in order to seek national independence and strive for national survival. If we allow this great enemy that destroys physical strength to exist, all our efforts will be in vain. Therefore, in order to enrich the physical strength of the people for saving the country, we must ban opium. This is the first reason.</p>
<p>2.  Opium is the great enemy of weakening intelligence and strength. If we want to save the country, we must ban it. Smoking opium not only destroys physical strength, but also easily causes brain drain and neurasthenia. As a result, thinking becomes slow, confused, and forgetful. The intelligence of our people is already backward. In addition to spending huge amounts of money annually to open schools, the government is now also vigorously promoting people's education and carrying out literacy campaigns, in order to improve the intelligence of the people and enhance their living skills. Indeed, to establish a country today, we must not only compete in physical strength, but also compete in intelligence. If opium is not banned, the function of education will be completely lost. Therefore, in order to enrich the intellectual strength of the people for saving the country, we must ban opium. This is the second reason.</p>
<p>3.  Opium is the great enemy of corrupting mental strength. To save the country, we must ban it. The so-called mental strength is "not being selfish and self-serving," but having a "strong belief in strengthening the country." Only by not being "selfish and self-serving" can we sacrifice ourselves for others, speak for the benefit of the public, and work for the welfare of the country. Only with a "strong belief" can we have a certain standard of thought and action, unite our hearts and minds, obey our leaders, and engage in the great cause of saving the country and saving the people. Those who are addicted to opium have lost their own morals and ethics, not to mention the virtues of "not being selfish and self-serving" and "strong belief." They lose the inherent talents of mankind and gradually erode the national strength of a country. Therefore, in order to cultivate the inherent talents of the people and enrich the mental strength for saving the country, we must ban opium. This is the third reason.</p>
<p>4.  Opium is the great enemy of consuming financial strength. To save the country, we must ban it. Those who smoke opium spend their income on the purchase of opium every year. Due to various special circumstances, the number is difficult to determine! However, it can be asserted that it must be more than tens of millions every year. If this amount is used for production and construction, or other beneficial undertakings, it will definitely benefit the country and the people. If it is used for building national defense, it will be even more effective in the near future. Now, we are watching this huge sum of money being consumed by the poison that sucks the marrow of people, which is extremely ignorant! Therefore, in order to enrich the financial strength of the people for saving the country, we must ban opium. This is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>All of these four points are what everyone can say and everyone can understand. Even those who smoke opium can be aware of them. The reason why they are unwilling to quit is mostly due to the errors in their psychological views. In other words, they do not understand the law of cause and effect, and the relationship between an individual and a country. It is estimated that the smokers think that whether or not to quit opium only affects oneself, and has nothing to do with others, let alone the country. They do not know that the organization of a modern country is like a human body. If a part of the cell is sick, the whole body will be harmed. Building a country today is like building a mansion. If a brick or tile is not solid, the whole building may collapse when a strong wind and rain come. How is our current China different from this? Therefore, if those who smoke opium understand this meaning, and understand the importance of the position occupied by individuals, and the danger of the environment in which the country is in, they should be able to suddenly realize and automatically quit. Then the government's ban on opium can achieve twice the result with half the effort, and the work of saving the country can be promoted without hindrance. If not, when the time limit for the ban expires, the government, for the sake of the survival of the entire nation, should painfully eliminate the painful parts, and will no longer forgive those who are still obsessed.</p>
<p>Moreover, our country's ban on opium this time is the last ban on opium. If it is successful, China will be free from the scourge of opium from now on, and the word "ban opium" will no longer be seen. If the ban is not successful, international credibility will be further damaged, and the national crisis will be further deepened. China will no longer be able to talk about banning opium. From this point of view, the life and death of our country depends on the success or failure of the ban on opium. When we commemorate Lin Wen-zhong, we should follow his spirit of thorough struggle to eradicate the scourge of opium, so as not to cause him further pain in the underworld.</p>
<h3>How Can We Accomplish Our Anti-Smoking Mission?</h3>
<p>— Du Yuesheng</p>
<p>1.  Cooperate with the authorities in the concessions. 2. Genuinely handle the registration of opium smokers. 3. Increase the number of smoking cessation hospitals.</p>
<p>Banning opium is a fact, not a theory. Therefore, since General Supervisor Chiang Kai-shek stipulated a six-year ban plan, it has won fervent sympathy and hope at home and abroad. There is no need to talk about theory anymore, we only need to earnestly follow and do it step by step.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the organs that implement the ban on opium are the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Municipal Police Bureau, which have handled it very appropriately. The Special Commissioner's Office and the Anti-Smoking Committee have also fulfilled their responsibilities in supervising, suggesting, and promoting. However, observing the environment in Shanghai, because of the concessions, the situation is more complicated. That is, even if we assume that we only ban opium in the areas where the administrative power of Shanghai City can reach, we cannot say that our task has been completed. We must find a way to cooperate with the authorities in the concessions, so that the concessions can understand that this kind of cooperation is a kind of justice, a kind of obligation, not a kind of seizure or a kind of right. In principle, the acting mayor of Shanghai, Yu, has already had a negotiation with the authorities in the concessions, and the situation is very good. Therefore, I very much hope that this matter can be understood openly and honestly by both parties, and then further concrete measures can be agreed upon, so that the entire Shanghai can follow the plan of General Supervisor Chiang Kai-shek and realize it step by step. Not only can Shanghai complete the ban on opium, but the entire China's ban on opium can also receive great results. This is my first hope.</p>
<p>Currently, according to the statistics of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, there are more than 40,000 registered opium smokers. However, in terms of the total number of opium smokers in the city, I am afraid that it has not yet been popularized. Although this is due to the concessions or the wait-and-see attitude of the opium smokers, our propaganda efforts and methods still have shortcomings. Now the government still allows opium smokers to make up for the registration, and the fees are very low, and the guarantees are also very effective. I sincerely hope that opium smokers can be aware and quickly go to the Municipal Police Bureau to register. At the same time, I hope that the propaganda organs and groups will take another step forward to awaken the general opium smokers, so that all the opium smokers in the city will register, so that the government has accurate statistics. This is greatly related to the completion of the ban policy, and I hope that everyone will not ignore it. This is the second point that I want to say.</p>
<p>Regarding the elderly and sick, or opium smokers who are addicted to smoking due to other reasons, we hope that they will quickly get a license to register. At the same time, for the young and strong youth in general, there are compatriots who are unfortunately addicted to opium. I hope with all my heart that they will wake up and have the determination to go to the hospital to quit. I dare to guarantee that there is no pain in quitting smoking on the body, and there is no need to be afraid. In terms of credibility, people did not trust you in the past. If you quit smoking, people will definitely restore your trust. You can be confident in doing things. At the same time, I hope that the government will ensure sufficient funding for the established smoking cessation hospitals, and implement the smoking cessation hospitals that are planned to be established as soon as possible. Let the opium smokers who request to quit smoking quit as soon as they come, and don't disappoint them. This is the third point.</p>
<p>Today, I take the opportunity of the June 3rd Commemoration Special Publication to roughly express some of my personal views. It can be said that there is no system at all. I hope that readers will forgive and point out any errors.</p>

<p>Telegram to the Nation</p>
<p>All newspapers across the country, forwarded to various provinces and cities, various agencies, public organizations, and schools, please note: All circles in our city, deeply distressed by the rampant smuggling that endangers the foundation of the country, have established the Shanghai All Circles Private Goods Boycott Committee. The purpose is to awaken the people of the country to swear not to buy or sell private goods. This matter concerns the maintenance of the national economic lifeline. We hope that everyone will advocate for this together and jointly save the critical situation. The Shanghai All Circles Private Goods Boycott Committee.</p>
<p>Declaration</p>
<p>The trend of smuggling is becoming more and more rampant, and recently it has spread from North China to Central China and South China, from the coast to the interior. If this continues without restraint, the national finance will lose its balance due to the reduction of tariffs, and the nation's commerce will be in danger of bankruptcy due to the seizure of the market by smuggled goods. Various public organizations in our city, distressed by the scourge of smuggling and driven by conscience, have organized the Shanghai Private Goods Boycott Committee. The purpose is to awaken the people of the country to swear not to buy or sell private goods, and to preserve a lifeline for the national economy. Specifically, it is to expand the anti-smuggling movement to reach the point where stores refuse to sell smuggled goods, factories refuse to use smuggled raw materials, citizens refuse to buy smuggled goods, and the transportation industry refuses to transport smuggled goods, in order to completely eliminate smuggled goods. All people with blood and vigor should express their sympathy and enthusiastically participate in this urgent movement to save the national economy. Indeed, the way to save the country is not limited to rushing to the front line to charge into battle. If everyone can start from themselves, refuse smuggled goods, and implement economic resistance, it is also enough to exert the power of saving the country. Our association hereby solemnly declares that not buying or selling smuggled goods is the key strategy for saving the country and revitalizing the nation at present. All Chinese citizens have the obligation to do their best to abide by it. If there are still unscrupulous merchants and shameless citizens who value private interests and disregard national interests, and take the buying and selling of smuggled goods as a shortcut to get rich, willing to become slaves and accomplices of tigers, then society will have strict sanctions, and they will be abandoned by the people of the country. This declaration is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Letter from Fujian</p>
<p>Dear Sirs, We have found that smuggling has become increasingly rampant in various places in the past two years. If there is no effective way to stop it, our entire national economy will be destroyed without remainder. Recently, we read in the newspaper that you, with patriotic enthusiasm, convened various circles in Shanghai on the 24th of this month to establish the Private Goods Boycott Committee. There is no better way to save the country and preserve our existence. Jinjiang is located in southern Fujian, bordering the coast, and the trend of smuggling is indeed very rampant, but the people's patriotism is not behind others. In addition to agreeing with your suggestions and adhering to them to the end, we will convene various circles in Quanzhou to establish the Private Goods Boycott Committee immediately. We respectfully request that you send a copy of the organization's constitution, the members' oath, and various regulations by express mail to the Quanzhou Eighty Division Two Hundred Thirty-Nine Brigade Forty-Ninth Regiment Headquarters in Fujian, in order to be consistent. We also hope to provide guidance from time to time.</p>

At the same time, major newspapers in the city, such as Shen, Xin, Min, Dagong, Shishi, and other major newspapers, as well as all evening newspapers, will publish special anti-smoking editions to promote publicity.</p>
<p>A Message to Opium Smokers</p>
<p>Opium smokers, today is another June 3rd Commemoration Day. This commemoration is about the Qing Dynasty Imperial Commissioner Lin Wenzhong, who strictly banned opium more than ninety years ago. He burned all the opium seized from foreign merchants in public at Humen, Guangdong, starting on June 3rd. This is a very great, glorious, and memorable day in the history of our country's anti-smoking efforts. Now the government, determined to thoroughly ban opium, has designated June 3rd of each year as Anti-Smoking Commemoration Day. You opium smokers must understand that the meaning of this commemoration as prescribed by the government is not just to hold a commemoration meeting on this day, or shout a few slogans, or put up a few posters and be done with it. It is to awaken you opium smokers, to have a deep understanding, to continue the great spirit of Lin Gong, and to have a firm determination to quit this opium, which is as poisonous as a beast and as harmful as a flood. And through this once-a-year commemoration day, we want you not to forget, to be able to persevere to the end, so as not to have a resurgence, and not to repeat the mistakes of starting but not finishing. This is the meaning of the government holding the June 3rd Commemoration. Today, all agencies, groups, and primary and secondary schools in the city are fully mobilized. In addition to holding a commemoration ceremony at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and expanding anti-smoking publicity, posting various shocking anti-smoking posters and slogans, and distributing various anti-smoking booklets and leaflets, in order to awaken opium smokers to a deep understanding, here are a few things that you opium smokers should pay special attention to in the future, and should strive to implement, and we sincerely and earnestly advise you, hoping that you will never ignore them again and cause regrets. ㊀ Opium smokers who have not obtained a license and are old and sick and cannot quit immediately should quickly go to the Municipal Police Bureau or nearby branch offices to re-register to avoid being severely punished and forced to quit after being found out. ㊁ Opium smokers who are determined to quit quickly should not hesitate and wait and see, and should quickly go to the Municipal Police Bureau or nearby branch offices to voluntarily register for quitting. You can quit without spending a penny or suffering pain, and safely escape the sea of suffering. This is a rare opportunity. ㊂ Opium smokers who have quit opium must firmly establish their goals, remember this commemoration day, and never smoke again, so as not to have a resurgence. ㊃ Opium addicts must quickly find ways to quit themselves, because the current laws absolutely cannot forgive opium addicts. If they are found, they will be sentenced to death. ㊄ People who traffic and manufacture drugs must quickly change to other legitimate businesses, because the government's laws on this matter are very strict, and once they are found, they will never be lenient and will be sentenced to death according to military law. It is really not worth doing this kind of business that harms others and harms oneself. The above points must be told by you opium smokers to your sons, warned by you to your younger brothers, and told to each other by relatives and friends. This is the great hope of this association. Issued by the Shanghai All Sectors June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration Conference, June 3rd.</p>
<p>County Government Commemoration</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Shanzhou County Government and County Party Headquarters will jointly hold a commemoration ceremony today. Li Zhifu, Zhang Jingye, and Jin Zuobin have been appointed as the presidium in the preparatory meeting. The venue of the conference is the Beiqiao Stadium. After the meeting, there will be a parade throughout the streets. In terms of written publicity, a special issue of the June 3rd Commemoration has been printed for distribution to the public. At the same time, an exhibition of anti-smoking and anti-drug materials will be held in conjunction with the Provincial Yu Tang People's Education Center. On that day, all opium addicts and drug offenders in the county detention center and county hospital will be given spiritual speeches by pre-appointed people to enlighten them.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Opium Smokers Re-register</h3>
<p>Those Who Have Been Detained Are Not Allowed to Register</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau, in order to facilitate opium smokers to have a final opportunity to register, specially launched a re-registration campaign starting on May 1st. To date, more than 4,200 people have applied for registration. In order to strictly register, the bureau has specially stipulated that those who voluntarily apply for re-registration will be allowed to re-register in accordance with the regulations without further investigation. Those who have been detained and sent to the bureau by various bureaus and offices will not be allowed to re-register, and will be sent to the opium quitting center for forced quitting in accordance with the regulations for smoking without a license, and then dealt with according to law.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Heavy Rain Causes Disaster, Cargo Transportation Obstructed</h3>
<p>Continuous Rain for Four Days and Nights - Major Roads Are Flooded - Shanghai-Fujian Ships Cannot Load and Unload</p>
<p>In recent days, the city of Fuzhou, Fujian Province, has been experiencing continuous heavy rain for a week. The upstream of Hanjiang has experienced a surge in water, causing the river water to overflow in Fuzhou Nantai and other places. Yesterday, the Sanbei Shipping Company of this port received a report from the captain of the Jing'an ship from Nantai to Shanghai, stating that Fuzhou has been experiencing continuous heavy rain, as if pouring, coupled with upstream floods and downstream flow, causing ditches in urban and rural areas to be flooded and unable to drain. In the past four days and four nights, the rain has been even heavier, without stopping for a moment, resulting in the flooding of all major streets in Fuzhou Nantai, hindering transportation. Moreover, the wharves along the river lack warehouses with a large amount of cargo, making it impossible for all merchant ships and civilian ships arriving in Fujian to unload their cargo onto the docks. At the same time, goods shipped out of Fuzhou cannot be loaded onto ships, resulting in the suspension of shipping and transportation. If the weather cannot clear up temporarily, commercial transportation will not be able to recover in the shortest period of time, causing great anxiety among the people of Fujian. According to reports, the Jing'an ship has been stranded in Fujian due to the rain for four days, and other commercial ships of various companies in Fujian have also been stranded. After receiving the telegram, the Sanbei Company had to postpone the Jing'an ship's schedule and wait for the weather to improve before loading, unloading, and sailing to avoid prolonged losses. Merchants in Shanghai and Fujian have temporarily delayed the loading of large quantities of goods to avoid losses.</p>

The meeting was very pleasant.</p>
<p>Group Banquet</p>
<p>Eleven organizations in Shanghai, including the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association, the International Affairs Research Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, the International Trade Bureau, the China General Federation of Industry, the Shanghai Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, the China National Goods Production and Sales Cooperation Association, the Shanghai National Goods Movement Federation, the Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, and the China International Trade Association, hosted a banquet for the mission and Dutch Acting Consul General Gassmann at the International Hotel at 8:00 PM last night.

We, on behalf of the Shanghai industrial and commercial organizations, extend our sincerest welcome to the head of the mission and all the members of the mission. Our intention is not only to express the hospitality of the host, but also because the Netherlands East Indies and our country are adjacent to each other, and more than one million of our compatriots reside under the rule of your government. Some are engaged in commerce, and some are engaged in cultivation, all of whom are law-abiding, naturally diligent and thrifty. For hundreds of years, they have accumulated the merits of hard work and the labor of cutting through thorns and thorns, and have been able to help promote construction in various places and cooperate with the governments of various places, creating the prosperity of the market and reaching today's modern atmosphere. This is well known and praised by your government and people. We also hope that in the future, there will be more progressive cooperation between the two countries, and the future is unlimited. Last year, our South Seas Commercial Mission visited your country to promote commerce between the two countries and to conduct inspections of industry and new construction. Your government and people extended a warm welcome and provided various conveniences for the inspections, which shows that the harmony of the feelings between the people of our two countries is by no means accidental. We welcome your delegation's visit. We hope that with the strength of Director Hogeste and all the members of the delegation, the trade relations between our two countries will become closer in the future and achieve common benefits, which is what we have been striving for day and night. I raise a glass to wish you all good health."</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Add Vehicles</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway bureaus have recently been experiencing congestion in freight transportation, resulting in insufficient allocation of existing vehicles. Therefore, they have plans to purchase new vehicles. Yesterday, a reporter from Dagong learned from the bureau that it has been decided to purchase 200 freight cars first, and has submitted an application to the Ministry of Railways for approval. The Ministry of Railways has handed it over to the Railway Purchasing Committee to be responsible for purchasing from domestic and foreign sources. It is said that the total amount of funds required is about 2 million yuan. As for the payment method, it will be decided based on the contracts signed with the companies from which the purchases are made. In the future, most of these freight cars will be used for deployment on the Beijing-Shanghai line. It is also learned that the bureau intends to add 22 locomotives and 50 passenger cars, which can also be purchased if approved by the Ministry of Railways in the future.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Compilation</h3>
<p>Henan Province Emergency Relief Completed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Federation United Disaster Relief Association received a telegram from Mr. Zhu Qinglan in Henan Province yesterday, stating (abridged) that during the disaster investigation trip, I witnessed the disaster situation in various areas, which was very tragic. The disaster victims are in urgent need of relief. The old and weak are starving to death every day. Cannibalism is heard of. If widespread relief is not provided, the most severely affected areas will become uninhabited. To save this catastrophe, a large amount of funds is needed. I deeply hope that people from all walks of life will donate generously and gather strength to carry out emergency relief and save the disaster victims from fire and water. When Lan Shiri arrived in Henan from Tongguan, Luoyang, he learned that emergency relief had been completed many times in various counties. Fortunately, it rained a few days ago, and planting was done in many places, with hope for next year, but it will be more than three months before the harvest. This difficult period of more than 100 days needs to be discussed. I am informing you of this first. Zhu Qinglan bows to the east. According to a telegram from the Western Henan Disaster Relief Association (abridged), the drought in Western Henan is severe. After the personal investigation by Zhu Zilaoxu Inspector Tang Commissioner, they were very sympathetic and have allocated relief funds for implementation. Although it has rained recently, autumn crops can barely be planted, but the harvest period is far away, and it is difficult to endure hunger and wait. We still ask your association to continue to raise huge sums of money to save the lives of the people. Guo Fangwu of the Western Henan Disaster Relief Association bows to the east.</p>
<p>Severe Drought in Shanxi</p>
<p>This year's drought in Shanxi Province is severe, with disaster victims displaced and starvation everywhere. The chairman of the province, Zhao Daiyou, specially telegraphed Shanghai for relief. It is learned that Shanxi people in Shanghai, such as Xue Dubi and Wei Juxian, are actively preparing to raise relief funds and are contacting philanthropists and fellow villagers in the city to organize a drought relief charity association.</p>
<p>Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Held Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association for Sichuan Disaster Victims held its seventh meeting at the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai yesterday (2nd). The following resolutions were made: ㊀ The summer vacation of various schools is approaching. The donation books issued by the association to the academic community should be collected before the 10th. Tang Jinbai, Xiao Yanbin, Gui Rongfen, and Lu Hanzeng will be responsible for handling this. ㊁ A telegram will be sent to the central government and the Sichuan provincial government, under the severe disaster situation in Sichuan, stipulating that the Sichuan provincial grain tax should be levied once a year to alleviate the people's burden. ㊂ If any committee member of the association has a banquet within three months, all expenses should be transferred to the Sichuan disaster relief fund, and the name of the banquet guest should be written on the donation receipt. It is also reported that the Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai previously telegraphed the Sichuan provincial government, ordering all counties to release the people who were detained for owing donations. The situation was previously reported in the newspaper. It is now learned that the Sichuan provincial government replied by telegram as follows: To the Shanghai Sichuan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, I have received your telegram and am deeply grateful for your concern for the disaster victims. This government has issued a clear order since May 1st to postpone the collection of district grain taxes and various miscellaneous taxes levied by local apportionment, and has ordered all counties not to offset or deduct the relief funds that disaster victims should receive, even for debts. A copy of the original telegram is attached separately. It is said that there are still instances of urging for payment, detention, and extortion of custody fees in various disaster-stricken counties, which is very surprising. However, please specify which county and which person are urging for payment, detention, and extortion of fees, so that a thorough investigation can be conducted. I am sending this telegram to inform you and hope that you will be aware of it. Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, bows.</p>
<p>Girl Donates to Disaster Relief</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM yesterday, a girl of only nine years old brought a piggy bank and went directly to the Dadao Radio Station on the third floor of the Sino-French Pharmacy on Beijing Road to donate to the Sichuan disaster. The manager of the station, Mr. Qu, and the chief engineer, Mr. Lu, personally received her. After inquiring about her intentions, they broke the piggy bank, which contained nine jiao and six fen of new auxiliary coins and one old double mill (ie, two jiao). After inquiring by Mr. Qu and Mr. Lu, they learned that she lived at No. 8 Yanjili, Old Garbage Bridge, and her name was Fang Dengfeng.</p>
<h3>Problem of Increased Property Tax by the Public Works Department</h3>
<p>Implemented on January 1st Next Year - Subcommittee Will Discuss Again on the 7th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department, due to its inability to balance its income and expenditure in recent years, will increase the patrol donation and land tax, which will be implemented on schedule. The issue of demolishing mezzanine floors has been strongly opposed by all sectors of society. The subcommittee is scheduled to meet again on the 7th of this month (next Monday) to discuss the matter. A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency specially visited Mr. He Dekui, the Director of the Public Works Department, and Chinese Director Jiang Yiping yesterday to inquire about the details.</p>
<p>Scheduled to Increase Property Tax and Land Tax</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. He Dekui, Director of the Public Works Department, said that the land tax and patrol donation in the concession were formally approved by the board of directors due to the Public Works Department's economic difficulties and will be implemented starting from New Year's Day next year. The tax rate collected from 1927 to 1930 will be restored. Specifically, ㊀ Patrol donation: From July 1, 1927 to the end of June 1930, the tax was collected at 16% of the rent, ie, 16 yuan per 100 yuan. In 1929, due to the sale of electrical vouchers by the Public Works Department, there was an income of funds, and the economy improved. It was decided to reduce the tax by 2% from July 1, 1930, and collect it at 14% until today. ㊁ Concession land tax: From July 1, 1927 to the end of June 1930, the tax was increased by 8 per mille per year based on the assessed value, ie, 8 yuan per 1,000 yuan. Also due to the sale of electrical vouchers in 1929, the economy was more prosperous. From July 1, 1930, the tax was reduced by 1 per mille and collected at 7 per mille until today. Therefore, the increased tax rate next year is just to restore the tax rate before 1930.</p>
<p>Serious Consideration of Demolishing Mezzanine Floors</p>
<p>When the reporter asked about the Public Works Department's issue of demolishing mezzanine floors, Mr. He said that this matter is now being discussed by a subcommittee composed of Chinese Director Jiang Yiping, Xi Yushu, and Western Director Mr. W. S. King (English). The Public Works Department recently opened a board of directors based on the subcommittee's report to discuss and decide. However, the Public Works Department is indeed very serious about this issue, so there is absolutely no problem with the mezzanine floors before the board of directors discusses and decides. The time when the subcommittee's report will be submitted to the board of directors and when the board of directors will be convened are still undetermined. It is also learned from the reporter that the Public Works Department intends to demolish the mezzanine floors after Mr. Bickerton's proposal to prevent overcrowding in the concession was raised at the general meeting of taxpayers on April 15, 1936. The Public Works Department then formed a housing condition investigation committee. The survey results show that all sectors of the city oppose this move by the Public Works Department, because demolishing the mezzanine floors without resettling the general public is a serious economic problem. Demolishing is only a "shortsighted" policy that takes care of one aspect. It is said that the Public Works Department may postpone the implementation of this issue.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Meeting to Be Held on the 7th</p>
<p>A reporter from Shenzhou News Agency interviewed Mr. Jiang Yiping, the Chinese Director and member of the subcommittee, yesterday. According to him, the subcommittee is actively studying the report of the Public Works Department and is scheduled to meet on Monday (7th) to discuss the matter. We are against the Public Works Department's demolition of mezzanine floors. It is because of this opposition that the subcommittee for studying this issue was formed. We are now studying better methods to solve this problem. However, the so-called cleanliness, hygiene, and education issues in the Public Works Department's report are of course untenable. No matter who, if they have 18,000 yuan, they will never live in a mezzanine floor. Fresh air and spacious houses are what everyone wants. It is not that they have no knowledge and therefore have no hope. Therefore, demolishing mezzanine floors is purely an economic problem. It is difficult to determine when the subcommittee's report can be submitted to the Public Works Department's board of directors.</p>

<p>The English-language newspaper *The China Press* reported that the resignation of Mr. Folisco, the Honorary Mexican Consul in Shanghai, was due to a book he had written specifically documenting the situation in Shanghai. He resigned to avoid diplomatic disputes arising from the book that would embarrass the Mexican government. Mr. Folisco recently returned to his hometown in Mexico and then went to New York. It is said that he has reached an agreement with a bookstore to publish the book, which uses the name "Miller" and describes the life of all sectors of Shanghai.

<h3>Joint Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee Disaster Relief Work</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee at 97 Rue Remi noticed that the drought in various provinces this year was particularly severe and immediately launched a campaign. It worked with the Chinese Red Swastika Society to jointly send personnel to Henan Province to handle relief affairs. It also raised and allocated funds to various provinces and associations to actively provide relief. The association was established a long time ago, and it has always been very conscientious in handling relief matters. It has long been trusted by all sectors of society, so donors are very enthusiastic, resulting in very intense work. Looking at the donation thank-you advertisements, which occupy almost half a page, one can see the extent of its support. The latest situation is specially recorded below:</p>
<p>Calligraphy and Paintings for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Weiquan of this city is a well-known collector in the country. In view of the severity of this drought, he was moved with compassion and specially sent ten ancient paintings and calligraphy works from the Ming and Qing dynasties, treasured in his secret collection, to the Shanghai Joint Chinese and Foreign Relief Committee on Rue Remi to help with disaster relief funds. One is a landscape painting by Wang Shigou, one is a landscape painting by Gao Jian, one is a landscape painting by Wang Dongzhuang, one is a landscape painting by Yang Longyou, one is a landscape painting by Tang Yusheng, one is calligraphy by Wen Zhengming, one is calligraphy by Qian Yuyuan, one is a book of leaves by Wen Jia, one is a book of leaves by Yang Xiting, and one is a fan by Wang Jian.

<h3>Record of the Shareholders Meeting of the China Cotton Trading Company</h3>
<p>New Shares of Eight Million Fully Subscribed</p>

<h3>Case of Russians Trying to Sell Fake Platinum</h3>
<p>The Police Filed a Public Prosecution; The Trial Concluded Yesterday and Awaits Sentencing</p>
<p>Russians Adam Sgan and Bai Laisi Gan previously attempted to defraud Shuanglong Foreign Company of 30,000 yuan with a large batch of fake platinum. Chief Inspector Bei Beining of the General Patrol House found out about this and arrested Ai Bai and the suspect Tuo Luogushi Gan and handed them over to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. The details have been detailed in this newspaper. This case was continued yesterday by Judge Pan Zhenyang in the second criminal court. First, the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that within the rescheduled period, the police took out the so-called 22 pounds of platinum stored by the defendants in the Dutch Bank, took a small bottle from it, and handed it over to the Shanghai Municipal Council chemist for testing. The result determined that it was not platinum at all and that it did not contain any platinum. It was actually metal antimony. It was found that antimony and platinum were originally difficult to distinguish, and this kind of antimony had been refined by the defendants, so if it was not tested, it was actually the same as platinum. As for the samples handed over by the defendants to Shuanglong Foreign Company, the German government's metal inspection institute had tested and found that they did contain 75% platinum. From this, it can also prove the fraudulent behavior of the defendants. It was found that Bai Laisi Gan, whose real name is Tai Naisha, has various letters and evidence that can prove it. Tuo Luogushi Gan was found to be unrelated to this case, so he was not prosecuted. Ai Bai and others were prosecuted for fraud under Article 339 of the criminal law. When questioned, Bai Laisi Gan said that the fake platinum was brought from Soviet Russia by a man named Ivanoff. He did not know that it was counterfeit, and Ai Gong was selling it on behalf of Bai Qi. He did not know the truth. After Judge Pan questioned him in detail, the debate ended, and it was decided to announce the verdict this Friday.</p>

Lu Jinlin confessed that he was 16 years old, from Nantong, and worked as a handyman. He did not know Lu Lao San, Lao Si, etc. He only knew Zhao Guiyuan because he delivered food. He also did not know the deceased Yin Genfu, nor did he see anyone beat anyone to death, nor did he know who beat him to death. His workshop was three or four miles away from the scene of the incident. At that time, he was watching the work, and the security team came and arrested him. Not long after, Zhao Guiyuan was also arrested, and he did not know what was going on. Zhao Guiyuan confessed that he was 25 years old and was a cook. He did not know what his boss was called. He heard people say that his surname was Lu. He also did not know who beat Yin Genfu to death.

<h3>Major Criminal in the Case of Robbers Shooting Russian Police Arrested from Anhui and Escorted to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yu Defu Claimed That He Did Not Commit the Crime; The Robbers Also Said That This Was Definitely Not the Person</p>
<p>Zhang Ganqing, a major bandit from Anhui, colluded to rob the Dacheng Money House in Zuanjiang on March 17 this year and escaped to Shanghai with the loot. In the late night of the 19th, while traveling through the Remy Road Gansiche intersection in the French Concession, he was seen by the investigator. Because he looked suspicious, he took him to the patrol house and found 268 auxiliary currency coupons on his body (that is, the loot of the Dacheng Money House). It was also found that Zhang had colluded with his party on December 1 of the previous year to rob a woman's leather bag in front of 1246 Lefeide Road and opened fire to resist arrest.</p>
<p>Li Yaming George (transliteration), a Russian who shot and killed, escaped and then successively captured Wang Fuan and Zhang Guangcai of the Municipal Party and 12 male and female suspects, and seized pistols, box cannons, and bullets. After being escorted to the Second Special Court for questioning and investigation, the nine male and female suspects were not prosecuted. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau took them to the Second Special Court for questioning. Zhang Ganqing, Wang Fuan, and Zhang Guangcai were prosecuted by the Law Office for crimes of robbery, murder, attempted murder, and private possession of military weapons. After Chief Judge Liao of the Second Special Court repeatedly opened the court for questioning, Zhang Ganqing and Wang Fuan confessed to robbing with the fugitives Li Chunhua and Yu Defu, etc. Because the Russian hugged Yu Defu, Li Chunhua opened fire and killed the Russian. The court detained them pending investigation and arrest of the fugitives for further questioning. It was reported in the newspapers. The French patrol house found a robber named Yu Defu in Hefei, Anhui, so the patrol house asked the Second Special Court to prepare a document and send investigators Lu Zhulin and Cai Jinzhang to Hefei to transfer the Yu robber to Shanghai. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Judge Liao of the Special Court came to the first criminal court for questioning. Police Office lawyer Fei Xizhen said that the investigation of Yu's crime in this case had not been completed and requested a further extension. Then, investigator Lu Zhulin reported that Yu Defu returned to Hefei on February 6 this year and was spoken for by Ma Changshou, the acting detective captain of that place. Yu was arrested at the Zhonghua Hotel outside the East Gate of Hefei. After Yu was brought here this time, Zhang Ganqing, etc. were questioned for confrontation. Zhang Yun said it was Yu Defu, etc. Zhang Ganqing confessed that he did not know Yu Defu in the case. The Yu Defu I confessed to was from Nianxian. Wang Fuan also confessed that he did not know this Yu Defu. The Yu Defu I confessed to, I had only seen once. Yu Defu confessed that he had been tried for seven years for a theft case in the 19th year, and was released from prison with a commutation of sentence in the 24th year. He had not committed any theft cases since then. He returned home to celebrate the New Year at the end of last year and was arrested in his hometown of Hefei. He did not know any of the three people in the case. He was actually framed. The court adjourned the hearing until the 11th, pending the summons of the principal to the case for further questioning. Yu Defu was returned to the patrol house and Li was still returned to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Xi Zai Stole Huge Sums of Money and Was Arrested in Hankou</h3>
<p>He has been brought back to Shanghai to wait for a joint trial</p>
<p>Chen Bogang, a native of this county, who lived at 552 Hede Road, was working as a Xi Zai at Defu Foreign Company at 261 Sichuan Road. On December 24 last year, a certain Qingdao firm sent three drafts to Defu Foreign Company, with a total amount of 7,280 yuan. After the manager of the firm signed it, he was about to hand it over to the compradore to enter the account for redemption, but Chen took the three drafts and escaped when his colleagues were not paying attention. However, Chen was inconvenient to go to redeem it himself, so he entrusted his friend Tu Rongbao, who opened the Hexingrong Electrical Appliance Store on Hede Road, to collect it on his behalf. Recently, Hua Tanmu Wu Yaozu and investigator Tian Zhengsheng of the General Patrol House found out about this and arrested Tu and handed him over to the First Special District Court. Because Chen was on the run and had not been arrested, the case was rescheduled. Now that the investigators found that Chen was hiding in Hankou, they had the same Hankou police authorities arrest Chen and bring him back to Shanghai the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the first criminal court of the Special Court. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi briefly stated the case and said that this case was related to Tu Rongbao's case, so he requested permission to adjourn the case and try Tu together. After Judge Qian Hongye interrogated him, he ordered Chen to be detained pending joint trial with Tu Rongbao.</p>

There were about ten young men in Western suits and three men in Chinese clothing in the room. They rushed forward, stuffed a handkerchief into Peipei's mouth, preventing her from calling for help. They then stripped off all her clothes, threw her onto the bed, and tied her hands to the bed railings with Western-style suspenders. Four men in Western suits then took turns raping her. They released her at around 10 p.m. Peipei then cried out for help. The rascals scattered and fled upon seeing this. Peipei chased after them but failed to catch them. She immediately reported the matter to the Old Zhabei Police Station. The police station sent her to Renji Hospital in a vehicle for examination. It was confirmed that she had been raped and that there were injuries to her lower body, hands, and legs. The police chief immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives in a car to Room 417 of the Far East Hotel, but the rascals had already fled without a trace.

<h3>Oriental Cultural Group Congratulates Edward VIII on His Marriage to a Commoner</h3>
<p>King Edward VIII of England will marry an American commoner woman on June 3rd in France. People in Oriental cultural circles believe that at a time when the great war of the struggle for rights is erupting, and abandoning the honor of the throne, breaking down class barriers, is a great example to the world. Therefore, they specially inform international peace groups in Europe and the United States to congratulate them, considering this a new trend in international intermarriage and world peace. The following is a letter from the Shanghai Sino-Foreign Cultural Association to international peace groups in Geneva: (Original letter in French) To the International Peace Groups in Geneva, forwarded to compatriots of all genders and countries on all continents around the world: The suffering of mankind from the calamities of the struggle for rights and the killing and class warfare is extreme, and there is no wonderful way to reconcile it. Now, the British Emperor Edward abandons the dignity of emperor of the world and marries an American commoner woman. The wedding will be held in Candé, France, on June 3. His yielding of the world is like that of Yao and Shun in China, and his breaking of class barriers is like that of Buddha in India. His love is sacred, like Jesus, who compared himself to a bridegroom. In this era of flying iron and blood, it is truly the descent of an angel of peace. From now on, Candé, France, should be the palace where the god of love and peace descends, and June 3 should be the festival when the god of love and peace descends. (Omitted) We, Asian men and women, salute the palace of the god of love and peace from afar, and offer our congratulations. We also hope that international peace and cultural organizations will convey to civilians of all genders around the world congratulations on this marriage that eliminates class barriers and brings true peace to the world.

<h3>Body of Murdered Teahouse Attendant Autopsied Yesterday</h3>
<p>Shen Heshang, a 39-year-old teahouse attendant from Xiangshan, Jiangsu, at the Yongle Inn, No. 11, Lane 440, Guangdong Road, was lying on the third-floor bunk at around 9 a.m. yesterday morning when his colleague, Zhong Xiaokui, stabbed him several times in the neck and other parts with a fruit knife. Blood flowed like a river to the ground. Seeing that he had caused trouble, the murderer fled the scene. Another teahouse attendant, Wang Laishun, caught a glimpse of the scene and rushed Shen to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he soon died. The hospital reported the matter to the Old Zhabei Police Station, which dispatched Chinese Detective Zhang Yi to investigate. It was learned that Zhong's job was also introduced by the deceased. Zhong was unusually lazy at work. A few days ago, a traveler had ordered Zhong to buy egg rice, but Zhong refused, and the guest reported him to the manager, who rebuked Zhong. Shen also added insults. According to people at the inn, Shen and Zhong had often argued in the past. As for why Zhong committed such a vicious act this time, it is still difficult to ascertain since Zhong is on the run. The body was transported to the autopsy center on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Song Genshan, a prosecutor delegated by the First Special Court, arrived at the center to conduct an autopsy. According to the statement of the deceased's wife, Shen Zhong, "I do not know the details of my husband's murder by Zhong. My family of several people depends entirely on my husband for a living, so I request that the murderer be arrested and that justice be served." After obtaining the statement, Mr. Song ruled that the deceased, Shen Heshang, was indeed stabbed to death before his death. In addition to the fugitive murderer, who should be strictly arrested by the police, the body was handed over to his wife, Shen Zhong, who signed a guarantee to claim the body for burial.</p>

She won 103 yuan and 4 jiao, which she put into a handbag to return home. When she passed by the door of her friend at No. 178 in the Eight-Tiled Houses Lane, she knocked on the door because she had something to say. Suddenly, Feng Xiaoke, a man from Shandong, rushed up from behind and snatched her handbag, fleeing in the direction of Pingliang Road. Hou Qian was shocked and chased after him, shouting "Robber!" Chinese Detective Liu Chunshu and Chinese Police Officer No. 2530 managed to intercept Feng Xiaoke, but the stolen goods had already been taken away by his accomplice and could not be recovered. He was taken to the Yulin Road Police Station and detained. Only one five-cent copper coin was found on him. He was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District yesterday morning. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated, "The defendant stated at the police station that he had recently come to Shanghai from his hometown and had been unable to find work for ninety-two days. Driven by hunger and cold, he resorted to this measure." When Feng was questioned, he suddenly changed his plea and denied it. However, Hou Qian firmly stated that he had robbed her.

<p>Lu Asheng, a 21-year-old man from Baoshan, was an apprentice at the Shifu Kee Liangpeng Shop at No. 905 Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, and had become a clerk after completing his apprenticeship. Yesterday afternoon, he went to the Renlichun Restaurant at the south end of the Great World to build a shed. At 5 o'clock, he climbed onto the bamboo scaffolding of the shed outside the third floor and accidentally touched an electric wire with one hand, causing him to fall from a height to the ground and be injured. He was rushed to Guangzi Hospital but died before he could be treated. The police station sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy center and summoned the deceased's family, as well as his shop owner and witnesses, to report to the Second Special Court for the dispatch of personnel for an autopsy today.</p>
<h3>Road Worker Carelessly Falls onto Tracks from Vehicle and Is Injured</h3>
<p>Zhang Yougui, a 39-year-old hook man from Beiping at the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway South Station, has worked on the road for more than ten years and is usually quite diligent. Yesterday morning, he was dispatched from the South Station to work at the Rihui Port Station. At 2:45 p.m., after finishing work, he boarded a Rihui Port freight car to return to the South Station. When the train was approaching the West Branch Road of the South Station, he accidentally fell from the car onto the tracks, causing two large holes to be broken in the back of his head and forehead. Blood flowed like a river, and he fainted on the ground. The conductor immediately ordered the train to stop, and several employees rescued him and took him to the South Station Railway Hospital Clinic, where he underwent surgery and bandaging. He was then hired a car and taken to the Lianglu Hospital in Bazilu, North Station, for treatment. His life is in danger.</p>

<h3>Tongyi Creditors Unanimously Approve Resumption of Business</h3>

<h3>Negotiation of New Land Film That Insults Our Countrymen</h3>
<p>Shocking and Disgraceful</p>
<p>The New Land film, a collaboration between Germany and Japan, is intended by one party to promote its Japanese continental policy and promote the puppet "Manchukuo," which our country considers to be a great shame and humiliation and does not want to watch. The film is being shown at the Wudong Cinema in Shanghai, and invitations were sent to all sectors of society yesterday. However, those who were invited believe that this kind of film that insults all our countrymen is something that no one in their right mind would want to watch, even for a moment. It is reported that the film deliberately depicts the map of the three northeastern provinces and a panoramic view of the Great Wall with the words "Manchukuo" on them. Another wide shot shows an armed Japanese soldier standing upright with a gun, implying that the new land was seized by Japanese soldiers by force. Such intentions can be described as wolfish and ambitious. It is learned that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested to the German side, and it is heard that the German side has agreed to cut out the above three points. However, the name "New Land" is already shocking. Which patriotic person would go to watch it and seek humiliation?</p>

<p>The homes of Zhang Guanjii at No. 36 Xinzha Road, Dai Xixiong at No. 574 Weihaiwei Road, Cai Wang at No. 50 Baidun Road, and others were broken into by several thieves armed with weapons between April 9 and May 4, and valuables worth several hundred yuan were stolen and the thieves fled separately. Chinese Detectives Cui Chengke and Xu Decheng of the Huishan Police Station learned that the thief leader, Gong Shaotang, a local, was hiding at No. 5 Meibaike Road. On the afternoon of the 9th of last month, at 9:15 p.m., they secretly went to the address and arrested him, seizing a handgun, eleven bullets, and eighteen pawn tickets. They continued to apprehend accomplices, including Liang Bingsheng, Sun Youren, Wang Jiatang, Zhang Anchang, Sheng Jintang, and the woman Li Wang, at No. 19 Datong Road in Zhabei. The handgun of Gong the thief was the item that Detective Gao Amao of the French Concession Police Station had lost in a robbery. These people had also robbed a car worth 1,600 yuan on Yu Qiaqing Road, license plate No. 2445. They used the car when they robbed the households.

<h3>Two Degenerate Youths Commit Suicide by Poison in Desperation</h3>
<p>Zhou Xuecheng Dies</p>
<p>Two young travelers came to the Shanghai New Inn, Jiujiang Road, Hubei Road, on the night before last and stayed in Room No. 275. One was wearing a Western suit and claimed to be Zhou Xuecheng, 26 years old, a local. The other was wearing short cloth clothes and was named Sun Shihua, 26 years old, from Zhejiang. The two laughed and talked freely that night and then went to bed. However, at about 9 a.m. yesterday morning, when the teahouse attendant went to inquire, he suddenly heard moans coming from the room. He hurriedly opened the door to investigate and saw that the two youths were both rolling in bed, spitting blood, which was all over the sheets. The teahouse attendant knew that something was wrong and immediately reported it to the police station, which sent a car to rush the two to the hospital for treatment. An examination revealed that they had swallowed some kind of poisonous acid powder, which was extremely severe. Zhou Xuecheng died at 11 p.m. that night, and the body was transferred to the autopsy center. Afterwards, the police station sent detectives to investigate and learned that Zhou Xuecheng had graduated from the Tongji Dental Clinic and had even gone to Japan for further study. However, because he was inexperienced in the world, he was tempted by a bad environment and spent every day in debauchery, throwing away all his tuition fees, so he returned home alone without completing his studies. However, he still stayed in Shanghai and did not return home, so he became acquainted with Sun Shihua in teahouses and taverns. Sun was originally the owner of the Guangda Laundry Shop on Dong Wuchang Road, but because he did not engage in proper business, he was expelled by his father. After meeting Zhou, because they were of similar temperament, they became a pair of unfortunate brothers, always following each other and lodging and returning together. However, both were poor and had no money, so they soon became frightened and could not borrow money. With no other choice, they resorted to this desperate measure.</p>

<h3>The Formulation and Implementation of International Labour Conventions</h3>
<p>— Cheng Haifeng</p>
<p>The purpose of the International Labour Organization is to improve the status of workers in various countries and thereby strive for social justice and the maintenance of international peace. Therefore, it is not a political group, has no political stance, and has no political intentions. The organization does not interfere with all international rivalries and hostilities that occupy an important position in politics. Its aim is to improve the living standards of workers socially and economically. Therefore, nine methods and principles of labour conditions are specifically stipulated in the charter: ㊀ Labour should not be regarded as a commodity or merchandise; this is the main principle. ㊁ Workers and employers should have the right to assemble and associate, as long as their purposes are legal. ㊂ Workers' wages should be paid according to the times and local conditions and should be considered sufficient to maintain an appropriate standard of living. ㊃ Those who have not implemented the system of 8 hours of work per day and 48 hours per week should actively adopt this system as their goal. ㊄ A system of at least 24 hours of rest per week should be adopted, and Sundays should be included in the rest days as far as possible. ㊅ Abolish child labour and restrict the labour of young men and women so that they can continue their education and complete their proper physical development. ㊆ Male and female workers should receive equal pay for work of equal value. ㊇ When countries stipulate standards for labour conditions, they should give all workers legally residing in the country equal economic treatment. ㊈ Countries should establish an inspection system and employ women in this work to ensure the implementation of labour laws and regulations.</p>
<p>The International Labour Organization uses the above methods and principles to achieve the improvement of workers' lives and the promotion of international peace. The specific method is to formulate draft conventions and recommendations for countries to adopt and implement. These draft conventions and recommendations are formulated by the annual International Labour Conference and are one of the central tasks of the International Labour Organization.</p>
<p>The agenda of the International Labour Conference is determined by the Governing Body. Each issue must be repeatedly studied by the Governing Body before being submitted to the Conference for discussion (if necessary, an issue may be referred to a specialist committee for study). If it is considered possible to include an issue on the agenda of the Conference, the Labour Office is requested to compile a brief report describing the legislation and customs of the issue in various countries, and then the Governing Body makes a final decision. If the issue is adopted by the Governing Body and included on the agenda of the Conference, the Labour Office must prepare a detailed report (also known as a grey report because its cover is grey) for reference during the Conference discussion. The discussion time for each issue is quite long. According to the current two-stage discussion system, it takes two years from discussion to resolution. The first year of the Conference begins with a preliminary discussion based on the grey report to determine whether it is necessary to make a draft convention or recommendation on the issue. If so, the points that should be asked of the member states regarding the issue are also decided. The Labour Office immediately prepares a red questionnaire based on the key points decided by the Conference and sends it to the governments of the member states for consultation and response. A final report is then compiled based on the answers of the countries (also known as a blue report). At the end of the report, a draft convention or recommendation is attached for adoption by the next Conference. The Conference of the second year will make a final resolution based on this blue report. According to the Conference's charter, the formulation of a draft convention requires the approval of more than two-thirds of all members present at the Conference before it can be established. The content of such a convention is not permanently immutable. If an already established convention needs to be improved due to changes in the environment, it can be amended and improved at any time, and a draft amended convention can be made.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Talking about Opium Suppression on June 3rd</h3>
<p>— Yan Chang</p>
<p>Writing this topic feels a bit unnatural. Why do we have to talk about opium suppression on June 3rd? It's like only remembering national humiliation in May. Since the Opium War in 1839, it has been nearly a hundred years. In such a long time, we are still talking about opium suppression on June 3rd every year. Where do we even begin? However, some people's minds are numbly pitiful. I'm afraid that if there wasn't such a day designated as Opium Suppression Memorial Day, they wouldn't remember the pain of our "poisoned land," just like seeing the bloody Day of Shame in May and shouting that it's time for the oppressed nation to turn over! What is hoped is that these days should not be seen as "routine." Don't just shout and sing on that day and think that's enough. To suppress opium, you have to eradicate it. To avenge humiliation, you have to bury your head and work hard. Every day should be June 3rd, and every day should be a day of national humiliation.</p>
<p>The Municipal All Circles Opium Suppression Conference has decided to start at 8:00 AM today. The Aviation Association will send four planes carrying colorful slogans to distribute in the sky. Starting at 9:00 AM, representatives from all walks of life will hold a memorial meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and commemorative badges for the June 3rd Opium Suppression will be distributed to all representatives attending the meeting. Starting at 11:00 AM, drugs will be burned at the Shuji Elementary School in Tianhou Palace. Starting at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, lecture teams organized by the Municipal Party Department and other organizations will set out to give lectures in four districts and distribute various leaflets and slogans. Other major newspapers will publish special commemorative issues, and performing arts groups will broadcast opium suppression programs. Judging from the above measures, this commemoration has already exceeded the level of "routine." Even if the mind is numb to any extent, one can probably know the harm of poison, right?</p>
<p>However, the author still has one point of view, which is that the above methods only achieve "pacifying the inside." Under the current enemy's "poisoning policy," it seems that we should first "expel the outsiders." Not to mention the distant places, such as the Manchukuo and Eastern Hebei areas, where opium dens are everywhere. Tianjin and Pingjin under "special" circumstances are also openly selling opium. For example, the widely circulated "floating corpse" incident, according to the News Inspection Office of that place, ordered all newspapers to uniformly call them "poison beggars." Although the truth is still unknown, it is expected that some of them are deeply affected by "poison" and thus become "beggars." And here in Shanghai, which is close at hand, a police officer was beaten while searching for opium offenders on North Sichuan Road. The evening news on the 30th of last month also stated: "At 7:50 this morning, the Shanghai-Pingjin train on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway arrived at the station. A Korean got off, looking very flustered, which was very suspicious. The guards of the North Station Police Sub-bureau ordered him to stop and checked him. As a result, about 44 taels of morphine were found in the cloth bag tied to the Korean's legs... The Korean rogue named Zheng Yin recently secretly established an organization to sell morphine and other drugs at 195 Malan Road in the French Concession, specializing in selling wholesale to our port and city." These are still the cases that have been reported in the newspapers due to being cracked. It is unlikely that other "rogues who secretly establish organizations to sell morphine and other drugs" will disappear, right? Therefore, only "pacifying the inside" is still a passive method. To suppress opium, it should be eradicated. It is hoped that today's commemorative meeting will go from "pacifying the inside" to "expelling the outsiders"!</p>
<h3>Fifteen-Year-Old Girl Becomes a Famous Bullfighter</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Whirr! Whirr! When a burst of trumpets sounded, a large bullring in Lisbon, Portugal, suddenly opened its doors. Only a thin girl could be seen, riding triumphantly on horseback, galloping into the center of the ring. Then, thousands of spectators in the ring, row after row as if sitting on high steps, applauded together to welcome her. All eyes were on the girl's face, dressed in black and white checkered clothes. The girl's name is Concita. She is only fifteen years old this year, but she is the world's only female equestrian bullfighter. She is also a skilled rider. She often seeks out the most ferocious bulls to fight and demonstrate her courage and skills. Although she is young, bullfighting experts from Peru are amazed by her superb skills after seeing her performances.</p>
<p>Although the spelling of the girl's name is close to Latin, she is an American. Her mother is the daughter of the famous writer Fulier, and her father's name is Licon, who graduated from the Western United States Army Academy. Her performance in Lisbon was her first performance in Portugal. Portugal is the birthplace of bullfighting and a gathering place for bullfighting talents. Bullfighters with mediocre skills dare not go there to show their skills. Ms. Concita is confident and her salary is about US$1,200. Her first performance was a great success. That day, she defeated two pairs of ferocious bulls. Later, she also performed twice at Walpole's.</p>
<p>Fighting bulls on horseback is completely different from ordinary pedestrian bullfighting. Fighting bulls on horseback does not kill the bull. The individual goes back and forth with the bull in the ring. There is no assistant holding a dazzling shawl, ready to rush up and wave the shawl at the bull to attract the bull's attention, so that the fighter can stab it. There are also people wearing gold and silver luminous clothes. When the fighter and the bull are too close and the situation is dangerous, they run around on the left and right of the bull to make the angry bull dizzy and confused, thereby rescuing the fighter. The number of assistants is not fixed, three or five.</p>
<p>As for the goal of fighting bulls on horseback, there is only the horse and the fighter riding on the horse. The fighter does not hold a dazzling shawl, nor does he hold a gun or other weapons. He relies entirely on his skills, courage, and horsemanship to dodge the bull's sharp horns. Without real skills, he would not dare to go down to the ring.</p>
<p>Ms. Concita was born in the town of Astafagasthai in Chile. When she was a few years old, she moved to Lima, the capital of Peru, and has been living there ever since. She has never liked to wear girls' clothes since she was a child, but she likes to wear riding shorts. Her parents repeatedly advised her, but she always ignored them. Once, she even wore riding shorts to church, and her father warned her with kind words. She replied: "Dad, I'm afraid of missing the prayer time and not having time to change clothes. Can you allow me this once?" Her father smiled and stopped, and said: "Good girl, you are very young. I don't think it matters. Go in."</p>
<p>She has repeatedly performed equestrian skills in Peru and competed with the best riders, winning many ribbons, silver cups, and medals. She can ride any wild horse on her back and drive it freely without feeling any effort. Portuguese bullfighting champion Camira, while touring Peru, happened to see her galloping on horseback and secretly praised her. So he got to know her and taught her the skills of bullfighting. She is talented and learns quickly. Before long, she looked like a veteran, so at the age of twelve, she went down to the ring in Lima to perform, and she became famous in one fell swoop. So her teacher Camira advised her to show her skills in Lisbon. She later performed twice in Lisbon. Her skills and courage were praised by Portuguese bullfighting masters.</p>
<p>If you get to know her well, she will lead you to her home in Lima to see her collection room, which is simply a museum. The room displays many silver cups, medals, and many silver-made spurs that she won in competitions. Some of these spurs were won by her own competitions, and some were given to her by contemporary bullfighters and athletes. It is said that Ms. Concita is the number one collector of spurs in South America, and they are all extremely exquisite. In addition, there are</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Many pottery, knives, swords, saddles and other items.</p>
<p>She loves animals very much. She has many dogs, horses, rabbits, squirrels, pigeons, and long-tailed parrots in her home. But she loves dogs and horses the most. She teaches them many extremely strange tricks, and their every move can be controlled by her.</p>
<p>Someone asked her if she would like to continue to engage in dangerous sports? Ms. Concita smiled and replied: "I dare not say." Perhaps she is lively and may suddenly change her mind, give up bullfighting and engage in safer sports. Her reward for fighting a single bull ranges from US$300 to US$500, but the reward for fighting two bulls increases to US$800. She also admitted the danger of bullfighting, but added: "I love this game and don't take danger to heart. Bullfighting can probably be regarded as the most dangerous sport. When the fierce bull unleashes its brute force and uses its sharp horns to charge east and west, the life and death of the fighter is between breaths. But bullfighting is the same as other dangerous sports. If there are no thrilling actions, it will disappoint the audience. Every time I go down to the ring, I will of course encounter all kinds of dangers, but riding on a horse that I have personally trained, I have never thought that I would be in a position where I cannot dodge, so I have always been at ease and bold, and only stop when I defeat the bull."</p>
<p>In the bullrings in Peru now, assistants are still used to disturb the bull's attention, making it easier for the fighters to succeed, but Peruvians love to watch Ms. Concita's bullfighting performance alone on horseback.</p>
<h3>Eyes</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>When my wife and I were washing vegetables and rinsing rice by the well, my wife quietly said to me:</p>
<p>"Have you seen Xiao Liu Zi these days? This little girl's eyes are going to go blind."</p>
<p>I thought my wife was cursing her, but my wife sighed.</p>
<p>"A fourteen-year-old child is going blind, how will she spend the rest of her life? Especially a girl."</p>
<p>As soon as my wife finished speaking, Xiao Liu Zi had already entered the bamboo door, carrying a bucket of water.</p>
<p>Immediately, I confirmed what my wife said. Her left eyelid was inflamed, and one of her eyeballs had lost the inherent luster of a child, instead looking like the eyes of a cooked fish, but with bloodshot eyes, and a large pile of eye discharge around her eye socket. The eyeball protruded, as if it would fall out with a slight movement, and a pool of blue liquid was rippling around it.</p>
<p>This ugly image made me suddenly shiver. I couldn't help but ask:</p>
<p>"Xiao Liu Zi, what's wrong with your eyes?"</p>
<p>She turned her head away and didn't answer me. Her little heart was already broken by the unbearable pain. She drew water and still tilted her head as she walked, not letting us see her eyes, as if this disease was an unspeakable shame to her.</p>
<p>"Where did this disease come from? Wasn't she fine a few days ago?"</p>
<p>"No one knows, she doesn't say it herself. The landlord said her father has a severe case of gonorrhea, and Xiao Liu's sister also died of blindness."</p>
<p>I felt like I shared the fate of this unfortunate little girl, and I felt very depressed. I recalled what my wife had said earlier. This little girl's future life is indeed a complete darkness. Is there any joy in life after losing your eyes?</p>
<p>At night, we were already fast asleep, but we were awakened by a commotion. It was Xiao Liu Zi's parents arguing. After the argument subsided, the night returned to its usual silence. Only the mournful insects in late autumn were weeping.</p>
<p>I thought again of the little girl growing up in this kind of family. Suddenly, I noticed that there seemed to be someone crying behind my window. Although the sound was very low, it was not drowned out by the sound of the insects. I asked my wife.</p>
<p>"Listen, is that Xiao Liu Zi crying? This girl is really pitiful." I couldn't help but get out of bed and open the window. In the moonlight, I vaguely saw a dark shadow on the stone steps near the back ditch.</p>
<p>"Is that Xiao Liu?" I asked. But she didn't move or answer.</p>
<p>"Alas, living in such a family," my wife paused and sighed. "Although the father is so poor that he can't afford the next meal, he only cares about eating, drinking, and gambling. Those bad things don't rot his own eyes, but they harm his daughter. This is fate."</p>
<p>I listened, listening to the sobbing, and slowly fell asleep.</p>
<p>However, after that night, I never saw Xiao Liu again, because she jumped into the river ditch that night, but the river ditch was too shallow, so she untied her trousers belt, put on her wet clothes, and hanged herself on a white poplar tree. Her parents didn't even know until the next morning.</p>
<p>"This little girl is too stubborn. But her fourteen-year-old heart may contain more hardship than some adults..." My wife would say this whenever she mentioned Xiao Liu Zi. But I will never forget that eye that looked like a longan pit from my hometown.</p>
