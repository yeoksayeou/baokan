<h3>躍進的日本</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>“倘若戰爭發生，食糧怎樣解决呢？”</p>
<p>這是一月八日的東京讀賣，特別對日本婦女提出問題。提出這問題的理由是：</p>
<p>歐洲的風雲，中國的動亂，隨時都有爆發戰爭之可能。日本是人人皆知的食糧缺乏的國家，因此不能不事先準備。倘若戰爭發生，生產食物的農村子弟，必被送到前綫，一切食糧工業，必將變為軍需工業，就是國家有點存糧，也不能不拿去供給前綫的戰士；所以日本婦女們，應當在此時期，未雨綢繆，努力研究家庭食糧的儲蓄法，節約法，以免將來感受過度的恐慌。</p>
<p>此外，他又主張：戰事發生時，政府應設立“食糧省”，“食糧省”的主要工作，首先是把滿洲的豐富食糧運入日本，以供日人食用，同時更實行消費節約，生產分配，統制及耐久的貯藏法等，以防止戰事延長後之食糧恐慌。</p>
<p>看過這樣的主張後，不禁令人聯想到“躍進的日本”。</p>
<p>“躍進的日本”！這五個字，在日本生活的人們，看見的機會是太多了。“躍進”原是好字眼，但看得太多了，也會令人心情特殊，精神抖顫。</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>也是在今年（大約是一月三號），日本所謂的“詩人”北原白秋氏，出版一本國民歌謠，題為“躍進日本之歌”。其中收集歌謠共一百四十五篇。報章宣傳，認為這是“集日本歌謠之大成，是鼓舞風雲，興隆國運的一個大原動力”。</p>
<p>是的，“鼓舞風雲”！“躍進的日本”，目前正需要“鼓舞風雲”。如果風平雲靜，日本從何處躍進呢？所以，在這部號稱為詩人所收集的歌謠中，“開拓滿洲喲”，“光輝的朝鮮”，“慰勞關東軍”，“大亞細亞聯盟歌”……等，都被收集在裏面，而且被認為是興隆日本的重要歌謠。</p>
<p>歌謠本是民間的反映。但若是一般時人們，體貼政府的苦心，藉政治的力量，製造出來的歌謠，那就又當別論了。</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>不錯，日本是在“躍進”着。你看，公共機關，娛樂塲所，那兒不寫着“躍進日本”呢？這是近年來日本的自誇，而且也似乎可以自誇。記得初到日本時，日本的皮貨很缺乏，要買一條大衣領子，也得花很多錢。可是現在呢？因為所謂的“滿洲國”，產業開發，貿易增進，所以東京的大商店裏，洋洋溢溢，皮貨已經不少。摩登的日本婦女們，只要看看自己所穿着的皮貨，也會體味到“躍進日本”的意義吧？</p>
<p>許多沒有的東西，現在都有了，這“躍進”是足以自誇的。然而，為保持這“躍進”，加强這“躍進”，因此，預算案不能不躍進，租稅不能不躍進，“勞動强化”不能不躍進，軍需原料的輸入，不能不躍進，社會的物價也就不能不躍進了。</p>
<p>加重國民大衆的担負，這在今日的“躍進日本”，已成為無法避免的事，决定“躍進”的勝負的，主要的是軍事力量。軍事力量不如人，那所谓“躍進”，恐怕也只是曇花一現而已。從一九三七年始，華盛頓條約和倫敦條約，都已失效，列强的海軍競爭，已進入無絛約時代。日本海軍的理想敵，第一是美國。美國有主力艦十五隻，日本只有九隻。美國有甲級巡洋艦十五隻，日本只有十二隻。美國有驅逐艦二百二十一隻，日本只有九十六隻，美國有潛水艦八十五隻，日本只有五十七隻。日本現在能和美國對抗的，只有航空母艦和乙級巡洋艦。但只憑這兩種軍艦的力量，那是太差太差了，所以日本的海軍當局，那能不提倡“建艦躍進”呢？但成問題的是美國也在“躍進”着，因此，這“躍進”的前途正茫無止境。</p>
<p>說到空軍和陸軍，日本的理想敵，不消說，誰也知道是蘇聯了。現在就把日蘇兩國的軍備，拿來比較一下吧。</p>
<p>先從陸軍說起：蘇聯有陸軍一百六十萬人，日本只有二十五萬人。蘇聯有戰車四千台，日本只有一百五十台。蘇聯有裝甲汽車一千台，日本只有八十台。蘇聯有高射砲一千五百門。日本只有八十門。</p>
<p>其次再說空軍：蘇聯有軍用機五千台，日本只有一千八百台。蘇聯有民間機一千台，日本只有一百五十二台。就說到海軍吧，蘇聯現在的海軍力量，也在日本海軍二分之一的力量以上（以上各種軍備比較，均根據“日之出”新年號）。並且蘇聯本年度的預算，國防費也比去年增加了十分之二以上，這就說明了“躍進的日本”，還需要大大“躍進”</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>也是因為躍進的原故吧？日本國內，平添了許多活動，也平添了更多的矛盾。失業者的人數，並未較前减少，享樂的人數呢，在今年也表示出特殊的現象。元旦日到明治神宮（在東京市內）的人數，比較去年就增加了十三萬（去年八十二萬人，今年九十五萬人）。可是，做為東京大出入口的東京驛的元旦旅行乘客，比較去年却减少了約一萬人。然而，東京驛的票價收入，可沒有因此受到任何損失。理由是：今年到伊勢，熱海，伊豆，和箱根諸名勝地方去的豪華旅客特別多。日本的報紙說：“這是今年景氣的好證據”（東朝——一月三日）。其實，倒不如說是軍需工業的跛脚景氣，還覺得適當一點。大衆的腰包是比去年空了。許多人去年還能經由東京驛，到較近的地方去，今年却只能在東京市內逛逛了。其他一方面，受到了軍需工業的恩惠的少數人們，却也比去年更闊綽了。跑到熱海，跑到箱根，跑到較遠的地方，去吟味他們自己的景氣。</p>
<p>本月二十一日，是日本開第七十次議會的日期。在每年一次的議會中，政黨都免不了要提出許多問題，質問政府，為難政府，藉以提高自身的威信。這原是官樣文章，成為慣例。可是這一次的議會呢，却令人不免有“山雨欲來風滿樓”之感。軍部和政黨的衝突，政黨和政府的矛盾，其尖銳化的程度，確是比以前“躍進”了。</p>
<p>在快要開會的議會中，政黨預備攻擊政府的主要問題：第一是外交問題，第二是增稅問題，第三是電力國營問題。關於外交問題，政府也似乎承認相當失敗了，目前正在請求自衛方策，企圖緩和政黨的猛攻。至於增稅問題和電力國營問題呢？因為他是代表軍部的意向，確立“準戰時的經濟體制”的，所以軍部已經表示意見，决意支持政府，若政黨要積極反對，則雖解散議會，亦在所不辭（東京讀賣——一月六日）。這樣一來，政黨不免要受到虛驚的，攻擊政府，原是慣例，得罪軍部，那就不能無所顧忌了。</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>實在說起來，最能乾乾脆脆認識“躍進日本”的眞象的，也只有日本軍部。官僚政黨的眼光，是太不夠格了。帝國主義的國家，要想“躍進，”就只有向外發展。若不能向外發展，那還“躍進”甚麼呢？“九一八”之役，一夜奪取滿洲，那對於日本，誠然是大躍進。“躍進日本”的名稱，就是從那時樹立的。</p>
<p>“九一八”以後，輕輕一脚，又躍進了長城。“躍進”！“躍進”！“躍進”雖然成功了，躍進前途也正多困難。軍備和別的强國相差那麼遠，你布爾喬亞的政黨，還要鬧甚麼“貓哭耗子假慈悲”的把戲呢？不增稅怎能增加預算，不增加預算怎能充實軍備。不用說還想再“躍進”，就是只為了保持這已經到手的勝利，也是非積極擴充軍備更加躍進不可的</p>
<p>“躍進”有難也有易。滿洲的北方是蘇聯，在蘇聯的邊境，關東軍就不能躍進一步。去年一整年，俄滿的邊境衝突，就記不清是鬧了若干次。滿洲的西方是外蒙，在外蒙應當是容易躍進的了，然而也不能。於是緊接着就来個外交的大躍進，這卽是轟動世界的“日德防共恊定。”你看，跨過蘇聯，跨過波蘭，去遠和希特勒總統講防共，這不是外交的大躍進是甚麼？</p>
<p>不只是嚴防本國的共黨，而且還要更進一步，替別的國家防範共黨。這也是“躍進”。</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>“躍進的日本”，對華態度也是躍進的。在西安事變未發生以前，本已决定要對中國採取“兵力行使”的“實力主義了”。但從十二月十三日至二十五日間，又忽採取靜觀態度。從十二月二十六日到新年一月五日間，又說由靜觀而採取嚴重的監視。六號以來，又忽宣言决用“兵力行使”的“實力主義”了。這雖然是根據中國內部的變化而跳來跳去的，但從這跳來跳去的姿勢，也可以看出“躍進日本”對華政策的躍進。</p>

<h3>英美互惠商約之障礙</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>英美合作是世界和平最有效的方法。英美商務上的合作又是英美親善最基本的條件在歐洲亞洲充滿着戰爭危機的今日英國商務大臣任西曼赴華盛頓商訂英美互惠商約。及兩國合作的其他問題。當然很值得我門注意。任西曼赴美的使命。似乎是很重大。關於商約問題。貨幣問題。裁軍恊定問題。美國中立法案問題。世界原料再分配問題。以至於失業問題。都曾和美國國務卿赫爾及大總統羅斯福談到。討論範圍。雖然廣泛。談判基礎。已十分接近。不過在任西曼完成他的使命以前。有一個障礙。他非先打破不可。這便是美國的中立政策。</p>
<p>英國現在很需要美國合作為取得美國的諒解便是在商務上在外交上要英國犧牲一點。他並不是不願意。可是他要美國保證。當英國陷入國際糾紛之時。美國不要拆他的臺。搗他的亂。目前進行中的美國中立新法案。便是最使英國放心不下的。現行中立法。二月底便滿期了。美國國會中急進份子。很想訂定一個更極端的法律。使國際間一旦有戰爭。美國的貨物不但是軍火軍需。連煤油棉花麥子銅鐵等原料。他一律停止輸出。這樣一來。無異是說放棄了全部戰時的美國對外貿易。英國是世界上最容易捲入國際糾紛的國家。同時他是最需要美國在經濟上予以援助的國家。假使這個中立法通過。英美的感情要形成絕大的裂痕。</p>
<p>現代戰爭是一個國家全部人力物力和別個國家全部人力物力的戰爭。資源供給的缺乏。是戰爭失敗的最大原因。如果英美訂定了互惠商約。英國的工廠用美國的棉花做原料。英國的人民用美國的麥子豬肉做食料。這個習慣養成。到了戰爭時候。美國忽然說。“因為我們怕捲入戰爭漩渦。所以我們再不給英國人以棉麥煤鐵等必需品。”在這種情形之下。英國或者坐以待斃。讓敵國打勝仗。或者視美國為敵國。派軍艦飛機到美國轟炸。因為經濟上之絕交。在目前情形之下。此宣戰還要利害。美國要推行中立政策。眼前决不能希望英國减低關稅替美國出口貨供給市塲。美國要同英國經濟合作。便要保證不採取太走極端的中立政策。所以中立政策。是英美互惠商約的最大障礙。</p>
<p>如果賢明的美國政治家。知道現在已經不是十七世紀。知道國際經濟合作是解决美國國內經濟恐慌的最好途徑。或者這個障礙。未始無打倒的可能吧。</p>

<h3>日人積極推進東北五年產金計劃</h3>
<p>採取大量金額充實國防財政　實行大陸政策圖謀不戰而勝</p>
<p>長春通訊、日人自九一八事變後、卽着手東北採金事業迄今業經五載、且於本年度起、實施其所謂五年產金計劃，故今年為第六年已往日人認為第一期</p>
<p>基礎　工事已告完成、現在正積極推進日人所謂第二期飛躍時代、目誇耀將由是以令東北政治•經濟•金融•得有劃期的進展、蓋因其以統制經濟為基調、以綜合日本之國策、作適當運營之方針、如就日人之採金事業而言、當偽組織成立之初，以其為特殊性、故置於統制之下、乃獲有異常之</p>
<p>進展　如再由其產金額觀之、在日會社統制下之產金額、於日本昭和九年（民國二十三年）為五十萬七千元、昭和十年（民國二十四年）為三百六十七萬元、昭和十一年（民國二十五年）為一千萬元、卽每年平均比去上一約增三倍以是日人對之甚抱樂觀、以為循此而進、則年產額達一億元、必期不遠也、日人又以為能有此好成績、實由其統制之功也、至於此外之</p>
<p>原因　則為日會社直營作業所之採掘進展、第一、佳木斯南方之小石頭以手掘採、現在約有七千名之採金夫、在日會社統制下、從事採金工作、而在往昔之小石頭地方、原祗有民家數十之小村落、後以日人調查班在該處發現金鑛、乃召集採金夫開採、以致人口蝟集、現在人口已達二萬餘名，居然一大市鎮矣、日人并在該地設置一切娛樂機關、至其產金額、亦非常</p>
<p>殷盛　自去年一月至十二月、凡三百四十萬元、占整個東北去年產金額三分之一强、以其由去歲八月以降每月可達四十萬至五十萬元之多也、尚有共他陸績發現新金鑛、日人對之、抱有將來必大趨發展之希望心、第二、黑河西南約二百里小興安嶺山中之泥鰍河、因地勢關係上、適於採金船之操作、去年以來、卽從事建設、在去年十月底完成、已着手</p>
<p>採掘　以其成绩尚佳、日人又認為將來活躍大可亟待、按此種採金船、其一桶之容量為五立方呎、重量七百噸、為五百四馬力、一個月之採掘能力、可達十二萬立方碼、關於採金船之驚異的機械化、實可謂日人心目中之東北採金方法劃一新紀元也、現日會社方面、仍繼續增設採金船、至於採金船之能性、與凌渫船型同、船頂之上、設採金裝置、目前日人計劃中之最大者、係十五立方面積之採金船、其</p>
<p>船體　長四十五米、寬十八米、高十九米半、重量為一千噸、馬力為一千二百匹、一個月採掘能力為四十萬立方碼從業員分晝夜三班交換、僅須二十九人操作、其採掘能力、與採金夫七千人相等、而日人在土門子更發現廣大之砂金礦、查該處之砂金與普通狀態不同、係在山上、如感洗水不足、可在水之高處做一水閘、引用二百尺或三百尺高落水壓力、卽能採掘砂金、此種辦法、日人正在</p>
<p>準備　中、且以該方法雖日本內地及朝鮮尚無其例、將來完成時、該地之產金額、必異常躍進無疑也、此外又有呼碼河流域•阿本爾河流域•湯原縣牡丹江奧地•樺旬縣等地、凡極有希望之砂金鑛、均經日人陸續發現、至於山金、則有朝鮮與東北邊境之開山屯、牡丹江方面之青林等地、已經日人調查完畢、現正積極準備開採所有關於東北之採金事業、均以日人設立之採金會社為基礎策劃一切、以之隨東北五年產業計劃之日本國策使命、故有產金五年計劃云</p>
<p>樹立　此項計劃、由本年度起、其產金額以一億元為目標、其第一年為一千四百萬元、第二年為二千二百萬元、第三年為三千六百萬元、第四年為五千五百萬元、第五年為八千二百萬元、但以上之五年產金總額二億餘元、係日本會社事業範圍之產金數重、若再以東北全體抱括在內、如日本內地資本家之進出參加、其產金額可達四億或五億元、實屬可能、乃日人所謀產金事業之</p>
<p>進展　爲積極準備日偽國際關係之國防財政及恊助日本大規模移民政策之實行、而爲之籌措巨額經費、再者、東北金融狀態、現正陷於惡性膨脹情勢、日人擬伸張其經濟威權、故亟謀</p>
<p>充實　採金計劃、始可獲得大量金額、以救眉急、所謂正貨凖備充實、以達日僞國家財政基礎鞏固、增加國防力量可發揮其龐大戰鬥力、又所謂不戰而勝、方爲上策、更所謂日本大陸政策之根幹、東亞霸權之基礎也、</p>

<h3>旅歐隨筆</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者　列山</p>
<p>十六　行中國禮</p>
<p>有一次在交際塲中經過人家的介紹認識了一位德國中學教員某君，照例大家互通姓名，握一握手，但這位先生握完手以後，只管對着我微笑，不說一句話，時間半分鐘過了，一分鐘又過了，大家還是站着，我想糟糕，他旣不是一個啞子，但又不像一個傻子，這中間定有什麼秘密，我問他是否他第一次看到中國人，所以嚇得說不話來，他覺得奇怪了，他是在向我行最恭敬的中國禮，怎麼我反而不懂，哈，行中國禮，碰見了人不說話，這簡直是件新聞，據說，他是從一本書上看到的，并且是一個很大的禮節。有見官時才用，我問他，行這種禮時雙方到底要靜默多少分鐘然後才開口說話？這一來，好像我并不是一個中國人，因為連這個禮節都不知道，他笑了，這－點，那位作者好像并沒有提起，我說先生，你瞧，這一點是很重要的，那位作者是不應該忘記提起，譬如說，剛才我們兩個人一直行中國禮行下去，而沒有時間的限制那非行到大家變成啞吧不可</p>
<p>十七　中國人接吻用鼻子</p>
<p>許多中國的禮節，咱們自己不但不知道，甚至於翻破古書也找不出一種根據來，但歐洲人却懂得十分清楚，例如，歐洲人說，中國人接吻用鼻子。</p>
<p>中國人接物為什麼要用鼻子，是否因為講求衛生，在歐洲似乎得不到確實的解答，連名作家布克夫人對於這個問題也只有反面的解釋，她只描畫，中國青年男女不愛接吻，認為是外國的風俗，布克夫人旣然說過，中國人不知道接吻這回事，那末中國人接吻用鼻子大約多少總是對的。</p>
<p>旅居歐洲的國人，時常單為了這個，“鼻子”問題，不知道要花費多少口舌，</p>
<p>記得有一次，一位同學應某國團體的邀約作了一回演講，題目好像是“中國的風俗”，演講完後，當塲有一位女士站起來問他，中國人接吻用鼻子是不是真的，這位問學呆了一下，但隨卽用十分頑皮的口吻回答，“最尊敬的小姐，假如您不相信的話，我可以當面試騐，”這一來弄得全體聽衆鬨笑起來，</p>
<p>十八　又是一種看法</p>
<p>幾十年來中國受慣了帝國主義者槍砲的壓迫，一般人失掉了自信心，總以為國貨不及洋貨，外國的阿毛阿狗一跑到中國來便是洋大人，理由，外來的東西總是好的，</p>
<p>相反的是歐洲人，他們除自認是優秀的人種以外，凡是他們本國的東西都比別人高明，耍他們佩服你，那可不是一件容易的事情，除非你能夠把他們打倒在地上，這時候他們才覺得你是一個好漢，</p>
<p>最近在歐洲報紙上突然發見了一位大政治家，這是說連歐洲人都佩服的大政治家，這位政治家是中國人，蔣介石先生，</p>
<p>過去蔣介石先生在歐洲報紙上只佔一個普通的地位，人家認他不過是吳佩孚•張作霖一流的人物，等到兩廣問題和平解決，中國正式統一以後，就在這一天歐洲各報立刻改變了論調，好像發見了一個新人，於是你說中國是再興了，我說蔣介石將軍是一位了不得的人物，一位天才的軍事領袖，一位大政治家，一位大外交家，他說，蔣介石將軍巳是一位國際政治舞臺上的要角，乘他五十歲生日的機會，歐洲各報都發表專文介紹，大家都說他是現代中國的象徵，是挽救中國唯一的領袖人才，這在歷史上還是第一次，一位中國的政治家有了國際的聲譽，說來慚愧，咱們中國人自己對於蔣介石先生還沒有十分清楚的認識，—原因，據一位英國記者的意見，因為蔣介石先生不善演說，—而在歐洲人眼中，蔣介石先生已是一位一十世紀的偉人，他的地位已同斯太林，慕索列尼，希特勒，凱瑪耳將軍一樣，正如一家德報的意見，他的命運就是中國民族的命運，</p>
<p>本年十月二十九日英國每日電聞報登載了一篇長文介紹蔣介石先生，中間有一段說起，蔣介石將軍有冷靜並遠大眼光的才能，可以同他相比擬的在世界上只有幾個人，但超過他的人物却沒有，</p>

<h3>幾個有關英語敎學的中等敎育問題（三）</h3>
<p>— 王世杰</p>
<p>第三、中等敎育應當培養學生自動的精神、不但是在研究學問上、就是在應付事情上、都應當養成富有自動性的精神、使受過中等敎育的學生畢業之後如果升學、能够研究新的學問、如果做事、能夠創造新的事業、扼要的說、就是養成學生應付事變的能力、我這裏所說的應付事變是採用極廣汎的涵意、不單指在社會上所遇到的某幾種險要事變而言、我們在學校裏的歲月、或幾年或十幾年、就得進入社會、在社會裏面所遇到的事情無論是屬於學問的職業的•技術的•或對人的關係、更或國與國的關係、都免不了遇到從前所沒有經過的局面、這就是廣意的事變、在這種局面發生的時候、身當其衝的人所受的敎育、無論是在學校內或在學校外所得來的、就要遇到不可調和不可遷就的試騐、一個人無論曾住過學校多少年、他曾否受到實際敎育的訓練也只有遇到這種試騐的時候饞可以判明、不但是在知識方面、技能方面是如此我們在行為、操守方面也不斷的要遇到一些事變的試騐、來判明我們在修養方面是否受到實際的訓育、照這樣說、我們可以看出、知識的培養與操行的培養、是有不可分離的關聯、在學校裏面的課程、應當認為只是培養這種應付事變的能力的工具、凡是只能墨守成規的學生、只能做機械工作的事、在學問上不能開新疆土、在事業上不能有新創造、在社會上不能負大責任、更不能利用機會以謀自身前途或者社會福利的發展、要養成學生在知識上自動的精神、在中等敎育的時代、是－個最大的關健、</p>
<p>第四、中等敎育應當適合國家與社會的需要這個問題有兩方面都應當顧到中等學校一方面是預備學生升學、另一方面是預備學生進社會做事、這兩個方面辦中等敎育的人應當依據一種標準、計劃起來使雙方面都能平均的顧到、並且按照有系統的計劃、使雙方面的敎育程度都能達到一種最低最適宜的限度、國家與社會的需要、尤其是在今日之中國、對於中等敎育的這兩方面都有不能减低的基本要求、大家知道、現行中等學校的分類、是時中學•師範•職業三種學校分開辦理、將升學的預備集中於中學職業的訓練集中於職業學校、這是根據許多年的經騐决心廢棄從前混合制度而决定的方針、不容輕易變更、但照目前中國辦理中等敎育的情形看來、只怕離開這個目標、差的很遠、這些年以來、中國的中等敎育太注重第一方面而幾乎完全忽略了第二方面、使中等敎育、偏重在升學方面、而將預備學生進社會做事的一方面完全抹殺、從幾件事上就可以看出、這種極不合理的趨勢、第一是中學太多、職業學校與師範學校都太少、照民國二十一年的敎育統計看、全國的中等學校數目、中學幾佔百分之六三、師範學校不到百分之一九、職業學校不九到百分之、全國中等學校的學生數目、每百人中有七十五個是中學生、師範學生不到十九個、職業學生不到七個、中等學校的經費的支配也顯出同樣的比例、全國中等學校的學生有五十幾萬人、這個數目中倒有四十幾萬是中學的學生、國家辦敎育、用鉅大的欵項、無數人的心血、最低限度是希望每一個快成年的青年人、在社會上都能做一點確實有用有益的事情、若是這四十多萬的青年、各人都盡各人的才能、積起來對於社會應當是多大的好處、但現在一般中學裏面多半的學生於六年間所受的實際敎育、能否達到這最低限度的目的恐怕是一個極大的疑問、再看目前中等學校學生升學的情形、現在每年高級中學的畢業生約有九千、高級師範的畢業生約有七千、高級職業學校的畢業生不到三千、三種合計起來、約有兩萬人的光景、這兩萬人照原則講、都有向大學或專科學校投考的資格、而現在全國大學與專科學校每年招生的情形、投考的人照二十五年度已經知道的統計、總共約有五萬四千多人、取綠的人總共不到一萬人、還不到百分十八、現在全國大學生的總數、也一共只有四萬多人、若依些標準、已四十多萬中學生就有十分之九沒有升學的機會照現在一般大學的設備情形、看起來、他們每年招收新生盡其最大的容量也只能容納一部份高級中等學校的畢業生、其餘的部份旣然失學、只有進入社會就一新職業、職業的訓練、雖然不是中學的事、但這幾十萬中學生的就業的問題、終不能忽略過去、中學的訓練、在課程與操行方面、</p>

<h3>特種現金保證制度與時代精神</h3>
<p>— 潘文安金慕堯</p>
<p>我國之有銀行，倡自遜清末葉。三十載以還，雖主持人士，行政當局，銳意改進，力圖擴展；顧格於環境，天災人禍，不皇寗息，以致時至今日，有待於改進者尚多，不容諱飾。諸如業務方針，投資途徑，均有足資指摘之處，此其大者，姑置別論。餘如人事保證制度，實為銀行當局從業人士俱感難於處理之問題。凡事窮則變，變則通，洵非虛語；年來改革人事保證制度之創議，如“信用保證”“特種現金保證辦法”等，屢見不鮮，而尤以後者為新穎而適應時代趨勢。該制為交通銀行總經理唐壽民先生及該行秘書兼人事課長王維因君所規畫，迭經上海市銀行業同業公會，銀行學會等集會研討，認為切實可行。近方廣徵批評，以期盡善（原文詳載一月二十七日申報）。在茲改革保證制度聲中，實為一富有研究價值之問題，爰抒管見，就正時賢：</p>
<p>“特種現金保證辦法”之基本精神，在於銀行與從業員間，相互負聯帶之責任。辦法之大體：以甲乙丙三種保證金之提存，為物質上之保證；以聯帶責任之嚴課，為精神上之保證。其辦法為：㊀行員進行時，按月薪三倍之數，繳納“甲種保證金”，由銀行存儲，按週息一分二厘給息。退職時，如本人並無舞弊或因同事舞弊而本人被聯帶處分情事，則本金全部及利息之半數，得予發還；尚有利息之半數，由行方撥充“行員保證準備金。”㊁行員按月繳納薪額百分之二之“乙種保證金”，由銀行存儲，按週息一分二厘計息。退職時，如本人無舞弊虧欵情事，得扣除因同事舞弊而比例攤賠之數後，予以發還。㊂每年由銀行撥發“丙種保證金”若干萬元，專戶存儲，按週息一分二厘計息。銀行另設“行員保證金戶，”於每年年終，將㊀甲種保證金利息之半數，㊁乙種保證金之本息，及㊂丙種保證金之本息，收入該戶，充“保證準備金。”遇行員發生舞弊案件，虧空欵項時，除沒收其甲種保證金及利息之半數並依法查封財產外，可將該項準備金提供彌補，集腋成裘，為數殊鉅，必可敷用。同時并嚴格規定凡與舞弊行員在同一行處共同或聯帶經手辦理該項職務之行員，及同一行處之直接主管者等，應受連滯處分，此制度內容之大較也。</p>
<p>二十世紀之時代，隨工業之高度發展，分工愈細，交易愈繁，社會人士，互相依賴之程度益深。一人之生產某一商品或商品中某一零件者，必須聯合生產其他商品或商品中其他零件者，相互交換或配合，方可獲得生活之所需，或使整件商品，產生價值。推演所至，使社會人士，在一切生活活動中，必須分工合作，人人為個別之貢獻，推動整個之社會機構。此種生產制度之演進，必然影響社會之意識形態idealogy，於是十九世紀盛行之放任政策與個人主義學說等，其目的在解除中世紀封建勢力之桎梏，以促進工業之生產力者，不復能代表當今聯立關係之社會思潮；因而狄驥Diguit拉斯基Laski及史潘Spann等西洋名儒，出而創“聯帶主義”Social　Solidarily“羣衆主義”（或稱“全體主義”）之學說，闡明社會之分子，均須互相負責，密切合作之理論，凡百活動，均須以顧全社全之利益為前提；凡與人合作，以促進大衆之福利者，則為善；吾行吾素，不顧大衆者，則為惡。甲有過失，社會全體須負責任；乙有貢獻，為社會全體合作之成果。故吾人服從政府之法令，並非受制於神權或君權之威嚇，而因鑒於此種法令，有助於社會之合作，合乎聯立關係之原則，因此，我人必須順從之，以結成密切之機構。此種精神，在現代進步之社會中，到處可見。在吾國最為流行者，如合作社及保甲制等，而“特種現金保證辦法，”亦屬適應此種時代精神之制度中之一也。</p>
<p>合作社之形式，雖可區別為生產合作，運銷合作，消費合作，借貸合作等；但其基本原理，則不離乎各份子直接活動，以達同一之目的，禍福成敗，由各份子共負責任，不受第三者從中操縱。此種原理，在借貸合作中最為明顯；社員借欵，由全體社員聯帶擔保，利用全體之力量，促成個別份子之健全，故一社員之行動，須全體社員之監督；蓋不如是，其他社員，卽有代有受過，連帶賠償之虞也。至於保甲制度亦然，一保一甲之居民，互相擔保，不為非分之事，茍生不端則同保同甲之居民，除事前確難發見者外，須受連坐之處分，故平時不得不嚴密監督，謹慎防微，偶有不端，卽須告發。施行得宜，確有使里閈安𪧫，閭閻靜謐之功效。以上兩端，國民政府定為復興農村經濟，籌備地方自治之要政，竅其精義，無非採用聯帶主義之原理而已。</p>
<p>“特種現金保證辦法”之所以較優於保人制度與信用保險者，以其採納聯帶主義之精神，適合時代演進之趨勢。行員進用之初，須繳納照月薪數三倍之“甲種保證金；嗣後更須按月扣繳月薪數百分之二“乙種保證金。”如同事中有人發生舞弊，虧空行欵，則全體行員“甲種保證金”利息之半數，與“乙種保證金”本息之全部，有被提充彌補之可能。此種聯帶陪償之辦法，足以喚起同事間互相關切，發生休戚與共之情感者，一也。舞弊發生後，同一行處共同或連帶經手辦理該項職務之行員，及同一行處之直接主管者，應受連帶處分；足以促使共同處事之行員，對於他人經辦之事，必須鄭重覆核，審察週詳者，二也。</p>
<p>舊式之保證人制度，缺陷滋多，毋庸贅述。而任令行員各自覓保，不相聯擊，保證人對於被保行員之行為，又鮮監督之機會，此種個人主義色彩濃厚之陳法，不能適應分工精細合作殷繁之社會，將來必為聯帶主義之新制所代替，亳無疑義。筆者因鑒於舊制之廢棄不容猶豫，而新制之所以必為社會所採用者，實具有時代精神之基礎；故樂為表而出之。（完）</p>

<h3>二十五年份鹽務整頓成效</h3>
<p>稅收越二萬萬較民十七增四倍　建設工程與改善工作均見進步</p>
<p>去年份我國鹽務工作之推展、與其成效如何、頗為社會人士所關注、茲悉鹽務稽核總所二十五年初步年報、業巳完成、爰亟探錄如下、</p>
<p>鹽稅總收入　依據各區初步統計報告本年鹽稅總收入、已超過二萬萬元當民國十七年、本所未恢復時、鹽稅收入、僅為五千四百萬元零、未及十年竟增至四倍之多、（近八年中、稅牧疊有增進、十八年為六一、○七一、○○○元、十九年為一○四、五八一、○○○元二十年為一三四、二二八、○○○元、二十一年為一四二一八五、○○○元、二十二年為一五九、二四七·○○○元二十三年為一七七四六一、○○○元、二十四年為一八五、四－六、○○○元、二十五年為二○五、四三三、○○○元）上年稅收之激增、雖由於年歲豐穰、與時局之較為安定、而鹽務本身之整現實為其主因、上年改革事項舉其重要者如鹽塲工程之加緊建設、緝私之厲行整頓、包商之廢除、稅率之整理鹽務組織之繼續改善以及官商積弊之痛加革除、均直接間接足以增進稅收、至新衡制之實行、雖鹽稅無形提高（但亦有數處減低）然鹽斤運銷、受經濟學上報酬遞減律之支配亦影響甚鉅蓋稅率愈高則鹽價愈昂普通人民、大都貧困、其購買力自必愈弱·矧稅率騾增、走私之風、亦必愈盛、殊非原有之緝私設備所能應付、加以不肖商販因加稅之故、復乘機操縱從中漁利、故鹽斤稅率、甫經增高官銷必暫時隨之銳減、就歷史上檢討、歷代末季每將鹽稅增加、其結果稅收反形大減、此其明證自二十三年實行新衡制以後、官鹽銷數、不無稍遜但因鹽務組織健全原有稅收、不特不因過量加稅而減少、且有相當進步賓為難能可貴且為應付高稅壁疊起見、對於緝私方面復大加整頓、故年來因加稅而減低之銷額、現已漸復舊觀、爰將本年內舉辦之重要事項撮術如次、</p>
<p>機關之裁併　自二十一年鹽務稽核機關、兼辦鹽務行政以後、各區鹽務行政機關歷年陸續歸併、綜計節省經費、每年達四百餘萬元、本年五月復將淮南運副一缺裁撤、並將揚州分所改為支所、淮北分所改為兩淮分所、以統制兩淮鹽務七月間、將川北運副一缺裁撤、川北分所及重慶稽核處、均改為支所、將原有川南分所改為四川分所、以統制四川鹽務、十月間又將兩廣運使－職、改由兩廣稽核分所經理兼任、每年節省經費六十餘萬元、又四川區鹽塲散漫、亦經本年十月間分別裁併、以便集中管理、目下各區鹽務、行政及緝私事宜、除山西雲南外、均劃歸稽核所辦理、職責完整、事權一貫、用是鹽政乃入於新階級、遂有清明發展之氣象、此項組織精神、實與二十五年七月間立法院通過之鹽務機關組織適相符合、</p>
<p>塲區新建設　長蘆淮北廣東等三區鹽場建設、如儲鹽倉坨、稅警營房、圍塲公路、運鹽河、及電話網等項工程、已大部竣事新產之鹽、按時歸坨、私鹽稅減，本年閩魯浙淮蘆等區鹽場建設工程、仍照前定計劃積極進行、所有全年工程、預算經費、除四川廣東河東三區不計外、共達六•五○一•七八○元、上年董莊决口、黃流南灌、淮北一带、幾成澤國、為救護鹽塲維持民生計、經呈準財政部撥欵六十餘萬元、交兩淮建坨委員會、會同全國經濟委員會、江蘇省政府、將善後岑池軍軸三河分別疏濬、宣洩下流、以免泛濫、計工程共長四十六公里、已於本年告竣、</p>
<p>稅率漸平衡　各區鹽稅稅率、從前輕重懸殊、至不齊一、近年迭經整理、已漸趨平衡、本年復就四川及揚子四岸各區加以整頓、川區稅率、原多至十餘種、經於三月及十二月、先後重加改定、使由繁複趨於單簡、兩浙之近塲輕稅、上南川之浙鹽稅湘南之粵鹽稅、豫岸三河尖之肩挑河、運淮鹽稅、江西建昌專岸之淮鹽稅、西北區之蒙青士各鹽稅、亦均分別加以整理、以期合於簡單劃一之主旨、</p>
<p>推進自由制　我國專商制度弊害叢生、而民國二十年公布之鹽法、亦首揭自由買賣之旨、近年以來、已將山東臨郯費沂四縣、及四川富榮引岸專賣、又兩浙永嘉等十八縣、福建上游南平等十八縣、兩廣汕頭等三十一市縣、及甘肅原有包商先後廢除均准散商自由報運、南京亦經劃出淮南食岸專商承銷範圍、改為淮南北塲鹽及精鹽自由銷區、本年續將福建閩侯等七縣、廣東恩平等七縣、及中山一縣、一律改行自由貿易、為施行新鹽法導其先路焉、</p>
<p>調整產運銷　各區所需食鹽、在引岸制度暫未廢除前、均由一定之產區供給、惟此制因產銷狀况、及其他情勢之變更、有須隨時加以調整者、如陝省關中西部向為甘鹽銷區、本年九月、因運道阻硬、甘鹽脫銷、人民將有淡食之虞、經准借銷潞鹽、以應急需、川湘兩區本年六月、亦有同樣情事發生、經分別設法調整、於產地銷區兩方利益、力謀並顧兼籌、又為調劑產銷、預防鹽荒、兼平鹽價起見、於蘇皖贛湘鄂豫浙閩各省及京市等、續辦常平鹽、此外各省區設倉運存鹽斤事宜、正分別積極籌備、</p>
<p>整頓各緝務　本年內整頓緝務最重要者為四川廣東兩浙一區、川粵緝政、原極廢弛、自各該區行政歸併稽核分所兼管後、同時將緝私警隊、完全改編、調派他區得力警官、前往切實整頓、兩浙鹽塲散漫、易於透私、在鹽塲包圍工程未完成以前、特增設查產警、分駐重要各塲、稽查製鹽工作及數量、嚴防私漏、</p>
<p>取締硝土鹽　硝土鹽之產製、以冀豫兩省為最盛、鲁省稍遜、蘇省徐屬四縣亦有之、質劣價賤、私銷極為充斥、經於冀省設立改良堿地委員會、實施改良土壤計劃、分盤井開渠放淤翻士深耕培畦加肥各種方法、並舉辦貸欵代種、勸植美棉、計本年份、貸出之欵、約五萬五千餘元、貸出種籽、約十八萬二千餘斤、私製硝土鹽者、已漸减少本年鹽稅收入、較諸二十三年、約計增加四百萬元、豫省亦經設立整理水道、改良土壤委員會、開關河渠、振興水利、本年內所𡋉河渠、計長五三六公里、蘇魯兩省出產土鹽縣份、對於改良土壤辦法、亦正仿照辦理、</p>
<p>管理石膏鹽　石膏鹽為石膏鹽之副產品、鄂省應城縣出產最盛、湘省湘潭縣亦有之、從前僅由地方政府徵收營業稅、其產製運銷、皆未經鹽務機關、依法管理、以致四出衝銷、妨害國課、經財政部建議、內鹽務機關接收管理、當派員赴鄂與鄂省政府接洽妥恊、於本年六月間接收、設立應城膏鹽管理局、實施管理湘省膏鹽、亦由湘省政府、移交湘岸稽核處接收、並經規定辦法管理、</p>
<p>外債已償付　鹽稅擔保之各項外價、本年均照財政部所定辦法、如期償付、茲將償還各債本息列下㊀湖廣鐵路偕欵、英金一四一、四五○鎊七先令一辦士合國幣二、二九一、五九七元二角七分、又英金六五鎊一○先令、合國幣一、○四○元一角三分、㊁克利斯浦偕欵英金一二八、七六八鎊一四先令五便士、合國幣三、四○一、一一九元四角二分、又英金二一二、五五五鎊七先令一一便士合國幣三、六四二、三○○元○三分、㊂英法偕欵、英金一六、九二九鎊一七先令九便士、合國幣二六八、八六九元三角三分、又英金二六七、七四三鎊三便士、合國幣四、四二二、二八二元九角六分、㊃馬可尼公司偕欵英金一八、○六九鎊一先令二便士、合國幣三○○、五四一元三角、</p>
<p>籌備新鹽法　新鹽法之要點、為就塲徵稅、任人民自由買賣、自公布以後、雖施行日期未奉核定、而本所整理鹽務、自應依照旣定準則、積極籌備、以便實施、惟實行新法、一方面須維持原有稅收、使國家財力、丁茲艱難之會國庫收入、不受影響、一方面在目前農村破產工商業不景氣之下、對於成本較高鹽塲，因自由競爭之結果、共消滅後數十萬鹽民之生計問題亦須顧及又專商制度推行已屆數百年、在國家財政上及社會金融上、均有其相互之關係故劃時代之改革允宜籌策周至、以期推行盡利、本所歷年對於實行新法之步驟胥視國家政治及財政之推栘而定、審度至再决先從管理場產改良鹽質、平衡稅率、廢除包商、以及整頓緝私改進鹽務組織機能為入手辦法、本所以為上列數端、業經積極進行、俟辦理就緒後、則新鹽法水到渠成、必能全部推動、而本年各區、對於本所政策、均能努力推行、其成效實有足稱者</p>

<h3>敬告未婚的少女們!</h3>
<p>— 丁笑如</p>
<p>在這裏，讓我來告訴你們，一件不可忽略的事情！</p>
<p>提起出嫁，這的確是女子心目中嚴重的問題。無論是生理上，心理上精神上，生活上，皆會於此時期內，起一種極大的轉變！換言之，也便是女子一生幸福的重要關鍵。</p>
<p>固然，愛情是結婚的原素，由於愛的結合，方有幸福。可是還有一件比愛情更重要的東西，那便是對方的健康。</p>
<p>眼光精細的女子，在她選擇配偶的目標中，雖亦有顧慮到這一層的。可是我說的，並不止於指對方有“結核疾患”或“惡性貧血”等，那種顯著瘦弱的男子而言。是容易忽視的，便是對方有“外表不易看出來的，已成慢性的花柳病——“梅毒”或“淋疾”了。</p>
<p>在這繁華的都市裏面，尤其是萬惡的上海！花柳病的蔓延，確實可怕之至！竟有“十男九淋，十女九带”的謠言；甚至有些喜歡涉足花叢的人，承認花柳病為一種時髦病。旣然花柳病的患者，多半是些時髦的男子，那麼，愛談戀愛的摩登女士們，在選擇配偶的時候，更不可不特別注意了！</p>
<p>一個未婚的少女，正如一朶含苞欲放的嬌花，倘出嫁之後，不幸受到這種惡病的侵害，便好似花兒剛開，卽遭受暴風雨的摧殘！是非常容易凋謝的。我們常常看到有些女子，因為結婚生活的健康，“內分泌”的刺激和亢進，越顯得豐腴美麗！可是有些體格本來很好的女子，在出嫁之後，反會突然憔悴得驚人！道不用說，一定是受夫婿傳染上花柳病的原因了。女子在感染花柳病以後，局部發生“陰道炎”，腫脤疼痛，流出膿性白帶，外陰部破潰糜爛，或生“軟性”及“硬性下疳”，與“梅毒疹”等。甚至引起“子宮內膜炎”及“腹膜炎”，而喪失生命！幸而治愈，亦必妨碍生育，或易流產，若為“梅毒”，更傳給胎兒，一生的幸福，犧牲殆盡！</p>
<p>從家庭方面來講，這種婚後的生活，怎能談到“美滿”和“愉快”呢？丈夫旣有花柳病，他平日的這德品行，也就可想而知。（犯“强姦罪”的人，多半有花柳病，這從“社會新聞”裏面，常常可以看到的。甚至有不道德的丈夫，使他的妻子，發生“直腸淋”。而起肛門狹窄，害伊終生。）但因這病是不名譽的，更不好意思把丈夫的罪惡去告訴別人，真是“啞吧吃黃連，有苦說不出”！精神和身體兩方面，都感受極大的痛楚與損失！丈夫在外面享樂，妻子却好端端的受無妄之災，這話真從那裏說起呢？（花柳病比較生產，更容易葬送女子的青春。）</p>
<p>從前舊式女子出嫁時，有兩句俗話是：“上了花花轎，拾着倒運票”！那不過是表明舊式婚姻的不良而已。但若新時代的女子，選擇夫婿時，祇注意其他的條件，忽略了對方的健康，更不幸傳染上這種可怕的花柳病的話，那真要算做“倒大運”了！</p>
<p>關係旣然這樣重大，怎能容人忽視呢？所以我希望未婚的少女們，必須慎之於前，千萬不可輕以身試，甘作此無謂的犧牲。本來，一個患有化柳病的人，若和人結婚，是一種最不道德的行為！雖然現行的法律上，已規定“對方有花柳病不治者，可以離婚”但旣被感染，則已噬躋莫及，終不若防患於未然。歐兩各國的男女，在舉行結婚禮時，都有“健康診斷書”的交換，這的確是一個好方法，我國也不妨仿效之。尤其是目今集團結婚盛行，大可以在舉行登記時，添進此一道宇續。（最好指定醫師檢騐之，以杜流弊。如患有花柳病者，非完全治愈後—因為已成慢性的花柳病，速患者自己也往往以為已告全愈的—不准其結婚。這不祇是關乎女子個人幸福與健康的問題，問接對於種族—也有很大的影響！我們不是要復興民族嗎？那麼，强國必先强種，母體若不幸受花柳病的侵害，怎會產生出强健的兒童呢？這一點，更是未婚的女子們所應該注意的了！</p>
<h3>美國婦女的新奇職業</h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>美國是一個婦女職業，非常發達的國家，而同時，因着生活的關係，有若干婦女的職業，竟是別具一格的。茲特介紹其數則如左：</p>
<p>㊀家庭設計員　這種家庭設計員，是供一般愛好摩登的家庭聘訂着，每星期作一次或二次的訪問，為各該家庭，依着光度，角度，氣候等等，而為設計着一切傢具的安放地位。就是小至一個鏡框，一個花瓶地位，也都在設計之列。用具色澤的設計等等，都在其範圍之內。至於檯布，窗帘，以及傢具的添置，自然更非由設計員，加以過問不可。據說，這個職業，是被女性所獨佔的。全國從事於這種職業的人數，雖無準確的統計，但至少，當也在一千以上。其報酬，最有名的計設家，紐約的白萊絲小組，每月可得五六百元之間。普通，都在一百五十至二百五十元左右。也有論次給酬的，每次最高價格為一十元。但也有低至三元或四元的。</p>
<p>㊁新裝訪問員　這也是女子的特有職業之一。她們顧問的範圍，是不只限於新裝的。舉凡衣服，鞋帽，塗脂，抹粉，以及行走，坐眠的姿勢的矯正等等，都包括在內的。所以她們服務的範圍，可說是包含着一切婦女美的形成的。這種新裝飭問員的歷史，還是不足十年，但現在已是遍及了全國的各大都市了。更其是紐約與好萊塢二地，是此輩麕集之處。此外，如芝加哥，華盛頓各地，也有不少在活動着。僅只紐約一地，據說，約有新裝訪問員，近三百人。這種新裝訪問員，大半都是精諳繪畫的。她們都憧得調和色彩，以及各種綫條的原理，精研着世界各地的婦女美，更參酌以當地的氣候與生活習慣等等，所以經她們指示而形成的，總是與一切並不諧和的美麗的婦女。她們的訪問，是不定期的，隨聘訂者的電招立至。報酬之數，每一契約，每月自四十元至八十元為度。每次通常在五元至十元之間，以該訪問員的著名與否，為高下之標準。紐約最著的麗瑪小姐，高達特夫人等，都因從事於這種職業，而擁有十餘萬，至二十餘萬的家產了。</p>
<p>㊂生活的伴侶　尚有一種，叫做生活的伴侶，是美國近三年來，新興的婦女職業之。不論家居，旅行，或出外購物等等，都可和一生活的伴侶來作伴。充任生活作侶的主要條件，是富有學識，富有對於各級社會的充分認議，有美妙的辭令，劇中更須富有滑稽的，以及幽默的故事，若能有一些音樂或科學常識冶家的或是育嬰經騐的，自然更好。在美國家中的一般高貴的婦女，最怕的，是獨居的寂寞。雖然在任何都市中，都有適於婦女消遣的俱樂部，但不愛上俱樂部去玩耍，或玩得膩煩了的婦女，也不在少數。對於這種婦女的精神痛苦的救濟，現在一般人，是公認為無有再優於召喚一個生活的、伴侶來談談的了。因為生活的伴侶，可因人而說着合人口胃的說括。天南地北的談着，使你感到着極度的滿意。若是在旅行中，得一個生活伴侶作旅伴，那非但可免旅途中的寂寞，更可因而得到不少的便利。這種生活伴侶的報酬，普通每日自五元至十元。現在雖然還在幼稚時代，但據說，在紐約一地，現在已有近百人。預計將來的發展，必然是將十分可驚的。</p>
<h3>姙娠期精神異常之起因</h3>
<p>— 石划</p>
<p>女性到了妊娠期，伊的精神狀態，往往是對於光綫感覺格外銳敏，嫌陽光，喜薄暗，而且味覺過敏，選擇食物，必擇其有刺激性者——尤其是喜食酸物；噢覺和聽覺也特別過敏；厭兒童，怕喧譁等等</p>
<p>往往有人說：這是起於憂慮出產時的苦痛而發生的，其實不然，這僅僅是表面的話。實在的原因，大約有機械，化學及胎兒排毒三大原因。</p>
<p>一，機械的原因：妊娠的時期，腹部的內臟，隨胎兒的成長逐漸膨大，各方面起一種壓迫的作用，因之精神上也顯然發生變化。</p>
<p>二，化學的原因：平常女子的血液中，水分本是很多的，但妊娠的時候，比以前還要多。因此神經的營養上，容易起一種的惡變。</p>
<p>三，胎兒排毒的原因：胎兒在母體中，一天一天的成長，不能不有消化呼吸和排泄；所排出的，都在母體的血液裏邊，母體因此硬發生精神上的障礙。而精神生活，也就起特異的狀態了。</p>
<p>正在妊娠期內的姊妹們，旣然明白了這起因，就不應該再有所憂盧，應該時常快活，因為母體的憂盧，是對於胎兒無益的。</p>
<h3>婦女們：到日光下去吧</h3>
<p>— 子弗</p>
<p>天氣逐漸地寒冷了，一向畏寒的人，又快到了潛伏的時期；終日守着火爐，輕易地不願外出。其實，這就衛生的觀點看來，是多麼的不適宜。</p>
<p>現時，過着都市生活的人，尤其是居住在大都市裏的人，實是難得有一些機會，與日光接觸或從事於日光浴。這，一方面當然是由於在大都市中能與日光接觸的塲所較少：同時，也不能不說是人們對這方面的不知注意，也其是一向有不好動習慣的我國婦女，假如居住在大都市中，真是難得與日光發生關係。因此，近年以來，都市中的婦女因缺乏唯他命Ｄ而引起的疾病的比率，有日漸增加的趨勢。</p>
<p>現時，冬季又快要降臨了。居住在大都市中的婦女們，與日光接觸的機綠，恐怕會更趨减少吧。照歷年的統計看起來，在冬季，由於缺乏唯他命Ｄ而起的疾病，要較任何別一季節為多。這種現象，尤其於婦女方面，表現為更為明顯。然則，日光究竟與唯他命保有着怎樣的關係呢？</p>
<p>稍具衛生常識的人，都可以知道，日光中有一種呌紫外綫的光綫。這種光綫，可以透過皮膚，在血液中發生了唯他命。據此，可知少與日光接觸的人，其血液中所能發生的唯他命Ｄ，當然為量較少。人體中旣缺乏唯地命Ｄ，則無機鹽類及燐酸的新陳代謝作用，便不能充份地遂行，因而引起了骨格的發育不良及生出了佝僂病與骨軟化等症。在一般紫外綫不足的地方，患這種病症的人，為數實非常之多。例如紐約的黑人中，患這種病的比率，據說達百分之九十。居住在上海的婦女們，患這種病的比率，雖無正確的統計，想來也必然是相當可驚。</p>
<p>隨着都市的物質文明之日漸加高，這種缺乏唯他命Ｄ所引起的可怕現象，也更趨於深刻。其原因，一方面固由於都市中的建築日趨增高，使日光照射的範圍縮小；他方面，都市中塵埃煤烟的加濃，也是一使紫外綫變弱的原因。根據這點加以推測，可知缺乏唯他命Ｄ的恐怖，在將來必會更加深刻一層。同時，這種恐怖給與婦女們的威脅，必將更為巨大。</p>
<p>為了補救這種缺憾，我們實有趕快養成多與日光接觸的習慣。尤其是冬季，更不應因畏寒而深居簡出。應盡量利用機會，與日光作充份的來往。假如每日能作日光浴兩小時，則唯他命Ｄ當可不致缺乏。這，可說是最良好的自然方法。此外，我們為了補其不足，多喫含唯他命Ｄ的食品，當然也極良好。不過，前者　　果，實要較後者為大。</p>
<h3>致Ｂ女士</h3>
<p>— 卓呆</p>
<p>令尊要　聽我的事，我覺得非常容易解决。他說：“庭中一棵老樹枯死後，打算更換一棵樹；但是這計畫，差不過有八九年了，至今沒有成功。因為形狀好看一點的樹，往往價錢大得不得了，我們支出上沒有這筆预算，所以辦不到。至於價錢便宜的樹，又都惡劣不堪，往往不足以裝飾這空庭，有什麼相當的辦法，可以解决這一個問題？”</p>
<p>這件事情，我可以用極簡單的方法，拿來解决。就是不要因為從前枯死的是一棵樹，所以現在也拘泥着必须要種一棵樹，只消種一棵以上的樹，這問題完全解決了。</p>
<p>要曉得：凡是可以獨立種的樹，必須要有獨立的資格，所以它的形狀等等，一定很美，價錢當然可觀了。</p>
<p>現在我們嫌着價錢太貴，要經濟些，不妨先去揀一棵大小適合的樹，譬如要一丈五尺高的，那麼，只要有一丈五尺高，形狀惡劣些，且不去管它。</p>
<p>把這一棵樹選定了之後，再看它缺點在伺處？假使它的樹頂倒不差，　　也　相稱，不過有一　，沒有樹枝，差不多缺了一隻角的樣子，那末，只消再去揀一棵樹，種在它的旁邊（就是缺的一面），補助它的缺點，就行了。可以獨立的樹，一棵樹能夠成一個“景”，不可以獨立的樹，不妨用兩次或三次來湊成一個“景”；但是這第一棵樹，選的時候，有兩點，要非常注意。第一，這補助上去的一棵樹，只消一面有樹枝，不必四面都有樹枝。一面有樹枝，方可以補它的一面缺樹枝。第二，那第二棵樹，不但要比第一棵樹低，而且要與第一棵樹的樹頂，角度相稱。譬如第一樹的樹頂，是一百六十度，那末，第二樹種在它旁邊，要樹頂恰巧能夠補它的角度內。假使角度太大，或是太小，就都不配。</p>
<p>這樣，把二樹凑成一景，兩　都是殘廢的　，　錢幣然很便宜的了。　三　　　凑成一景的，理由完全一樣。明白了此意，就大可應用。并且因着第一　的缺点如何，也不一定要再配一樹上去補不足，有時，配一塊石，配一其他物件，也能成為一景。這須看那棵樹的形狀如何，不能舉例了。</p>
<p>如果用一棵以上樹的集團來做成一景，那末，最要緊是各樹的樹頂，必須在一個角度內；而各樹相接近之處，最好樹枝稀少（或沒有）這不但是補助這些形狀不佳的樹的缺點，實在是順應着樹木自然的生活狀態。女士試觀：無論何處，如數樹集合在一處，外周的枝葉，雖非常茂盛，而其間各樹相接之處，枝葉往往極不發達。又一棵最高的樹，樹頂作若干度，其他各樹，必定會凑着它的角度，在它旁邊生活，這是很妙的。樹木的集團，也和人類的集團一般，人有集團中，出了一個大亨，其餘的人，都服從這大亨了，樹木竟也能如此。</p>
<p>請轉達令尊，照這方法幹去，不但所費有限，說不定所成的景，會比八九年前枯死的老樹，更為美觀咧。</p>
<h3>無恥</h3>
<p>— 秦晨</p>
<p>憶秋和竹君有一晚，無意間走過了東新橋附近那一段站滿着出賣人肉的姑娘的小街；當時憶秋就先開口了：</p>
<p>“這是什麼意思？好端端的人甘願做這樣下流的勾當，難道她們竟不懂得羞恥嗎？”說的時候，伊正用着一種極度輕蔑的眼光向一個正在使出了混身的力氣，想把一個青年工人拖進小弄堂去的妓女看着。</p>
<p>竹君的见解偏和伊絕然不同，伊的眼光中並没有轻蔑的成分，祇有一种憐憫的意思。</p>
<p>“不见得吧！”伊很感慨地嘆了一口氣。“你瞧她們不是一般長着五官四肢，能夠走路，能夠說話的人嗎？最初她們也未必不知道羞恥，並且也像你一樣的絕對痛惡着，無奈生活她們重重地壓住了，她們巳失去了一切的自由，祇能俯首帖耳，勉强茍延着她們的殘喘。”</p>
<p>“那末為什麼一定要生活呢？這樣的生活還不是早早尋死的好！憶秋彷彿是憤懣極了。當走完了那一段小街，將到轉角上的時候，還回頭去瞪了一個白眼。</p>
<p>“死？不見得怎樣容易吧！………”</p>
<p>竹君的話還不曾說完，憶秋已把她打斷了。</p>
<p>“跳河，上吊，吃藥，法子多得很，要死有什麼難呢？”</p>
<p>“不能從這一方面說！她們自己願意死，別人可不讓她們死！譬如她們的老鴇，便第一個不許她們死！再如她們的父母兄弟或是丈夫和其他的親族，也往往是直接阻止她們尋死，或間接使她們不能死的原因。”竹君的年齡並不比憶秋大，但她有一種善於觀察世故的特長，連下等妓女的環境她也估料得很清楚。“並且目前她們雖是很苦，但她們都還希望將來會有出頭的日子，所以她們自己也不願意死，願意忍耐。”</p>
<p>“這種忍耐便是無恥！”憶秋還是不能諒解。</p>
<p>“不，决不！”竹君立卽駁回了她。“因為她們當初幹這種營生原非本意，所以現在的忍耐也不是無恥！”</p>
<p>兩個人的意見根本發生了衝突，話就很難說了，便都默默地走着；後来竹君忽然又想起了一件事。</p>
<p>“秋，我给你一個反證！你說法科二年級的那個劉瑩是不是無恥”</p>
<p>“這話怎麼說？”憶秋顯然很覺得詫異。</p>
<p>“我說她旣不少吃，不少穿，祇為了愛出風頭，甘心去和許多的男同學廝混；又為了要多得幾分的分數”再和那個麻皮教授不時上電影院去。”竹君把一個鞋跟在水門汀上用九一蹬。“我看她真比那些妓女無恥得多了！”</p>
<p>有了這一個反此例，憶秋是完全信服了，伊臉上的第二度又透出了一種極度蔑視的神氣來。</p>
<h3>廢茶葉的利用</h3>
<p>— （詹逖先）</p>
<p>茶為開門七件事之一，為人生所必需，有許多人，對於吃茶，是很考究的，無用我說什麼綠甲，什麼紅了，什麼雲霧，什麼龍井，什麼……許許多多名稱。至於那一種是什麼味兒，怎樣好法，我因為不大吃茶，關於此道，莫明其妙且不說它。不過泡殘的茶葉，人家却當它無用。隨便拋棄，那知它却有許多用處。現在據我所知，把它寫在下面：</p>
<p>一，把泡殘的茶葉，倒在缸中，再加水泡，每天把這水澆在植物上面，可助生長。</p>
<p>二，患着眼疾的人，在睡後，每每糊封着不参睜，用泡殘的茶葉沖開水洗，較白開水有效。</p>
<p>三，用殘茶葉貼患有癐癤及破皮處，有不沾黏吸水，生肌的功用。</p>
<p>四，泡殘的茶葉，把它洗擦油膩的鍋，碗，桌子，盃箸等東西，異常乾凈。</p>
<p>五，把泡殘的茶葉晒乾，揉碎，儲蓄起來，做冬天小火爐裏的火種，非常耐久。</p>
<p>六，把泡殘的茶葉晒乾，裝在枕袋裏，枕在頭下，不但柔软，據說還可清火。</p>
<p>七，乾茶葉屑，可以驅除濕氣，有濕氣的地方，今天撒上一些，明天濕氣自除。</p>
<p>八，乾茶葉屑，用紙裹了起來，點起火來，日間可以驅蠅，夜間可以驅蚊。</p>
<p>區一點廢茶葉，尚有這許多用處，難怪前人說，竹頭木屑皆有用了，那末，對於廢物利用這名話，是格外可以證明理。</p>
<h3>墨沙里尼的夫人</h3>
<p>— 一髪</p>
<p>現代偉人墨沙里尼，是誰都知道的。但是關於他夫人的事情，知道的很少了。也有人在謠傳着他們已經別居在意大利是不能離婚的。况且她已經生了第四第五個孩子，便可證明他們的感情了。</p>
<p>在公家的會塲上，墨氏從沒有和夫人同時出現過。世界各國王侯貴族以及外交官和墨氏晤面者，而能夠見到賴克萊Rachele夫人的，那真是絕無僅有的。墨氏用自己的名字在旅館裏開宴會的時候，也見不到她和墨氏並立着迎接賓客。墨氏在自傳裏說：“我是屬於衆人的，凡是屬於衆人者，便不屬於任何個人”。</p>
<p>在今日世界各種雜誌上，墨氏的照片，觸目皆是，而這位夫人的照片，却不易發現的。因為意國的婦女决不和英美法德相同的，她們是盡力避開有碍丈夫的事情。她當然很愛墨氏，靜寂的在家裏担任着孩子們的教育。</p>
<p>賴克萊夫人是和墨氏同樣的出身微賤，是意國北部弗羅利的出身。早失嚴父，由她的母親阿娜養育的。她五歲時候，便汲水掃除，幫着飼養家畜她生平只在六歲至八歲時，讀了兩年書。後來便轉輾為傭工，到墨氏握政權之後，她還是時常到鄉間丟拜訪舊友的。</p>
<p>一九○五年黑氏的父親在弗羅利街上，開了一爿酒店，接待着行旅過客。管理菜肴的便是阿娜，賴克萊也在旁幫助着。當時墨氏因為政治活動的關係，被瑞士驅逐回國。和着幾個社會主義的青年，在酒店裏，終日發揮他的議論。於是十七歲的賴克萊和二十四歲的黑氏發生了戀愛的情苗。</p>
<p>翌年黑氏又被奧國驅逐回來，便住在弗羅利的賴克萊那裏，一九一年他們倆在米蘭居住，墨氏為報館主筆月薪一百元。他們夫婦和長女愛陶，在米蘭住了十年之久。在這個時期中，墨氏曾入獄兩次，上戰綫一年。到羅馬進軍，握得政權之後，便不再還米蘭來了。當墨氏在組閣的時候，夫人還是住在米蘭的公寓裏，處理家務，做忠實的意大利主婦，兩個在學校裏讀書的兒子，便是去年征阿國時，青年航空將校白阿諾和維多利亞。長女愛陶後來是嫁給現在意國外交大臣齊亞諾伯爵的。後来墨氏夫婦又生育了兩個小孩。</p>
<p>墨氏得意國最高的勳章，夫人便被呼為“敦娜”的尊稱。這勳章的受領者，可有和國皇作兄弟行的資格。倘若賴克萊夫人而喜交際的話，那末就是墨氏沒有此種功勳，她也可以自由的出入於社交界裏，但是這並不為夫人所喜的。</p>
<p>以前曾有墨氏和世界有名的婦人如何如何的謠言，一九二六年墨氏在白羅尼亞險遭暗殺，那時墨氏急求安全的住所，便還到了夫人的傍邊來了。她雖然沒有如何高深的學問，但是對墨氏的言行，與思想是十分了解的。墨氏的父親，在他們結婚之前，曾警告過賴克萊說：“你不必考慮我兒子的事情，這種事情等於投身於軌道之上。你倘若你和他結婚之後，你一身幸福和平都没有了”。但是她沒有接受這個忠告而和墨氏結婚了。</p>
<p>現在住在羅馬維拉。脫洛尼亞的賴克萊夫人，多麼和平面幸福啊，雖然墨氏决不是喜歡獻媚於女子的丈夫。根據了墨氏的自傳，便可以知道墨氏不但屬於賴克萊夫人，同時又屬於新興的意大利。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>宇垣組閣作最後努力</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>日本廣田內閣，承二二六事變之後，拜受組閣大命，經數度之奔走商討，內閣總算組成。然兩姑之間難為婦，好呌我左右為人難，到底因海陸軍意見紛歧，廣田內閣，遂以傾攪。計廣田登台不及一年，而諸事叢脞，意旨紛梗，不得不引咎辭職，以謝天下。</p>
<p>廣田去後，而拜受組閣大命的，乃落於宇垣大將之身。宇垣曾任朝鮮總督，物望素隆，亦為陸軍派之老前輩，故一般人的猜測，此老組閣，必無問題；詎知事竟出乎意料之外，陸軍態度强硬，海相調解失敗，迄今數日，宇垣雖尚未有放棄組閣之表示，作最後的努力，惟未獲極尠微之進步，則宇垣之組閣，看現在的形勢，必致流產無疑。</p>
<p>總之現在日本的政情，政黨與軍部的之爭，已到最後的一步，不是政黨投降軍部，即軍部投降政黨。現在雙方對峙的形勢，至為嚴重，非特宇垣組閣，不能順利進行，卽任何人組織均感棘手，若照雙方的形勢看來，有槍階級的陣容，非常雄厚，而無枪階級的形勢，亦頗不弱，失約非經過一度極嚴重的形勢與犧牲，則此問題不易解決也。</p>
<p>昨據日報載，宇垣大將今晨進宮，會見湯淺內府大臣，恊商打開組閣難關，比返私邸，卽有不速之客三人，尾隨而入，毀損宇垣絲質高冠一頂，要求宇垣知難而退，並無加害之意。若照此看來，宇垣可以休矣。其意若日假使此次宇垣不肯退步，定欲硬幹，或者還有其他或第二步不幸事件發生。此種主張，是怎樣一流人物主張，冪後站立着何等樣人，此不待猜想而覺鬚眉畢現矣。</p>
<h3>海的渴慕</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>高爾基說：“孩子是人間的鮮花”。用這句話衡量我底童年的時候，我常常感覺到：我是一朶像千千萬萬的孩子一樣的被蹂躪的沒開豐滿的花。在童年，雖然家庭是反對懦弱，胆小，反對妥恊的，他們却又不允許我勇敢地發展，他們自己却向社會妥恊，願意我作一個平常的，有安適生活的人，想呌我開成一朶不肥大也不瘦小的花。他們給我預備的土壤，就是這樣兒。我於是被殘酷地蹂躪着了。</p>
<p>然而，我是一個人，我會動作，我會選擇適合我的生活，可以將我培養成一個反抗者的環境。</p>
<p>我在這環境里，我生活了許久了，那些蹂躪的性格，正像一個猶太的年青詩人所寫的詩句說：</p>
<p>“沒有罪而被殺了的，</p>
<p>真理使他復活轉來！……”</p>
<p>都又在這土壤里重新獲得生命了。</p>
<p>我像一隻被關在籠子里的虎，重新學會了一切技能。我像一隻海燕從山谷的濃霧里衝出來了……</p>
<p>我渴慕着看到海，那在詩文里跳躍着的海，我更渴慕在它胸膛上預言暴風雨底來臨的海燕底生活，然而，我沒有機會航海，甚至海岸都沒見過。每次聽着朋友底燃着火苗的叙述，我底心就沉醉在裏面了。</p>
<p>我有一位年青的朋友，現在，他是一個海軍學生，他們所駐的軍艦在福建附近的海面，每次，我跟他通訊的詩候，總希望他能告訴我他每天看到的海洋：浪頭怎樣翻轉身，怎樣打得輪船Tung-Tung地響，潮息了，他又怎樣安靜，還有，海灘的美，是不是像豐滿的少女底肌膚，太陽怎樣在東方繡看彩霞，…</p>
<p>但是他總不能圓滿地答覆我。他只能很概念地說：海是人底情感一樣起伏着，英勇的，平靜的，……</p>
<p>我想：去看海吧，找個機會，到吳淞去，不是很便利嗎？那裏有海波起伏呀！很近很近的，化不多少錢，……</p>
<p>“但是，那兒沒有偉大的海，”一個朋友說，“那兒的水是混濁而不雄壯的；看了會呌你失望呢，還是渴慕着吧”！</p>
<p>有一次，我隨着一個工人劇團去離吳淞不遠的一家學校裏演戲，當夜裏一點鐘的時侯，戲散了，我們住在學生宿舍裏，主人告訴我們：“明天一早起來去海灘玩吧，可以看見日出的！”</p>
<p>首先高興的是我，雖然我知道：吳淞的海是不偉大雄壯的，可是我也知道：海有各式各樣的海，正像因為生活環境的士壤培植出各種不同樣式的人跟花一樣，像我，一個海的渴慕者，一隻剛剛突破濃霧向海飛翔的海燕，看看海，不管他是那一類的，總該是好的吧？——還有幾個沒見過海的人，也是這樣想。</p>
<p>第二天，晨星還閃着光，草葉還掛著露珠，我們冒着秋風底吹襲，後宿舍裏跑出來了。</p>
<p>但是，找不到主人，我們又不知道走法，很失望，一直等到要回上海了，主人才回來。</p>
<p>船在黃浦江裏向前進。太陽已經出來了，然而是陰天，又冷又暗，幾個人唱着歌兒，臉上的皮層有些緊縮的模樣</p>
<p>我底眼睛望着江水，那是發着黃色的，浪潮向前滾着，好像用布緊包着一捲沙向前滖，向船隻，江岸衝擊，發出憤怒的吼呌吶喊。一個浪被擊退了，摔碎了，掩沒在水裏了，接着又一個衝上去，好像永遠不會休止，除非敵人退却了……</p>
<p>我望着從上游流下來的江水，里面數不盡的都是浪潮。尤其是當太陽睜開眼睛，江心的潮水鍍上層厚金，像鋼鐵</p>
<h3>壓在山底下</h3>
<p>— 降伏</p>
<p>“西遊記”上有一叚：孫悟空給如來佛壓在山底下，他便再不能在天宮裏搗亂了！可見“山”是最利害的，我們平常也有一句話說：“泰山石敢當”。</p>
<p>人如果患白濁，那淋菌在人的體內搗亂，要使人感到萬分的苦痛，假使誤服劣藥，不但不能克服淋菌，還要錯過治療的時機！</p>
<p>唯有治淋新藥“的立平”藥力能直達病灶，澈底殲滅淋菌，不論新老淋濁，都能快速治愈，不含刺㦸腎臟—障礙消化的成分，效騐確實，無副作用。</p>
<p>所以“的立平”有重大的壓力，能壓死淋菌，斷絕了牠的禍害，而患者也能跳出魔網，步入光明的坦途。</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>經過鍜鍊一樣，更加堅實，光明，有力了……　　一隻手攀着船欄杆，一隻手拂摸着斜的鐵牽繩，我聽着江水底嘯聲，口里唱着歌，手在給他譜着歌曲似的。</p>
<p>水是向東流的，向海的方面流的，一切的擁護真理的人，都像一粒的鐵粉，向吸鐵石跑。江水，向海跑了……</p>
<p>我幾時才能看到海呢？他有豐滿而闊的胸膛，他有有力的臂膀，他有響亮的歌喉，然而，什麽時候他才能用他那有力的臂膀把我們擁在他底胸上，給我們唱慶祝勝利的歌呢？</p>
<p>像江水一樣，向東流吧，從濃霧的山谷里衝岀來的渴慕海的海燕們，呼喚戰鬥的勝利去吧……</p>
<h3>鬚</h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>最近養成了一種習慣，那或許是種很不好的習慣。但是到了中年，雖然沒有顯著的衰老，也決不能把時日倒推上去，而一點也不改變少壯時代的生活。尤其是我這樣沉默寡笑的，在孩子時代，已經被決定有“大人樣”的讚頌。一到中年，我真像活得太長久了，人生的苦惱已經把我磨練得消失了活潑的精神，我只覺得我太老了。那種習慣的養成，恐怕不無沒有關係。那習慣，就是喜歡獨自沉默着，用手指去撫摩頷下的鬚子。那鬚子，因為有過一個時候每天用保安刀刮着，現在變得硬而且粗了，它刺得我的手指微微有些生痛。不過在那樣輕微的苦痛中，我感到了一種莫明的快感，而且滿足了。</p>
<p>那習慣是到這裏來做了孩子們的師長以後養成的。說起來一半還是有他在的原因的，就是那柄保安刀忽然遺失了，而這裏是沒有這一類看來是屬於消耗品的東西出售的要刮鬚子，就得上理髪店。這里的理髪店，設備是簡陋得無可再簡陋，理髮匠的技術又是那樣拙劣，剪一個“洋裝頭”，在他們看來是一件很吃力的工作。記得我第一次去剪髪的時侯，他們見是“洋裝頭”，特地由一個他們稱做“老師傳”的理髮匠來担任這件工作，可是我寧願犧牲我的“洋裝頭”，終於削光了頭髪出來。那末，誰願意為了要刮一次鬚子而去忍受那“上帝的刑罰”呢？</p>
<p>於是，讓那些生硬的鬚子在頦下生長起來，不知不覺養成了這個習慣。</p>
<p>果然，留了鬚後是顯得更衰老一點的，據說做孩子們的老師就應該有那樣一種威嚴，這裏的教員，就沒有一個再比我年輕的。正式留着鬚子的有三個，他們不像我懶於理髮而讓它們茅柴似的蔓延在嘴的四周，嘴㫳上面剪成很美麗的八字式，頦下也是很整齊，用食指和母指撫摩着的時候，確也令人肅然起敬。</p>
<p>那幾位威嚴的老師也曾向我建議，興其那樣亂七八糟的讓它生長，不如正式留起鬚來，而且留成了一個式樣，以後只要用小剪刀略略修剪，可以永遠保持着狀態的•自己或許真的老了，聽了他們的提議，很想也正式留鬚，果然也為了少麻煩，不過更威嚴一點不是更好嗎？幾度自己和自己商量之後，我决意留鬚了，這裏雖然沒有好的理髪匠，修鬚子却很有幾個能手。</p>
<p>留鬚的第三天，我偶然高興，在散學後到操塲上看學生們玩皮球，有一個孩子却坐在墻角落裏哭泣，那是常有的事,孩子們簡直少踢一脚皮球也不惜大哭一塲的。於是我威嚴地找了一個比較大一點孩子問他，他不知道，找第二個，還是不知道，沒辦法我那把孩子抱了起來，騙他不要哭，問他誰欺侮了？那孩子看看我的臉色，哭得更厲害，倔强着蹲下地去，跑了，跑得那樣快。</p>
<p>後來另一個孩子告訴我他逃跑的理由：他怕我的鬚子，說是像土地菩薩那樣的一定不是個好人，這使我明白了那三位留鬚的同事，沒有孩子們到他們房裏去玩的緣故了。</p>
<p>現在我後悔了，孩子們是不喜歡老年人的，我應該年青起來，甚至一點也不像“大人樣”，我要每個孩子都喜歡我，像我喜歡他們一樣。</p>
<p>青春是寶貴的！</p>

<h3>「新生命歌」</h3>
<p>「壓歳錢」插曲之一</p>
<p>在行將公映的明星新片「壓歳錢」中穿插有歌曲七支：胡蓉蓉唱「壓歳錢」，「籠中鳥」，龔秋霞唱「年年如意」，「火山風光」，黎明暉唱「舞榭之歌」，姚萍唱「新年歌」，李麗蓮唱「新生命歌」。這幾位對於歌唱都所擅長，在輔助全劇發展的氛圍上，是收到了很好的效果。</p>
<p>七支歌曲中，前六只是屬於「靡靡之音」的一類，最後李麗蓮的「新生命歌」，是一只雄壯激昂的愛國歌曲，她領導着一羣天真的小學生高唱，那聲浪傳播到每個人的耳鼓，都不禁激發起愛國的熱潮，也附和着高聲的唱起來。—這是象徵着中華民族已經從「靡靡之音」的醉生夢死中覺醒起來，創造新的生命。</p>
<p>「新生命歌」的作者爲賀綠汀，兹錄歌詞如后：</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>「這兒有新的生命—火的熱情，這兒有生的意志—戰的精神。這兒有劍的鋒稜，有鐵的嚮聲，這兒有自由的百姓，有堅固的長城。這兒有同聲相應，有萬衆一心，這兒有你的無限前程，有我的引路明燈，這兒有前進，這兒没有消沉，這兒有前進，没有消沉！」</p>
<h3>藝壇花絮</h3>

<h3>白璐韓蘭根“天作之合”</h3>
<h3>新華動態</h3>
<p>貂斑華主演“瀟湘夜雨”大為興奮，該戲情節曲折，貂斑華今日大哭一塲，明日又狂笑不止，連日拍戲，喜怒無常，貂謂拍戲工作，原甚滑稽。</p>
<p>“夜半歌聲”已在趕緊結束之中，金由謂此片再拍下去，面皮將破爛不堪，每次拍戲必須化裝一怪人，拍畢則又必以戤司林洗臉，實在不易消受。</p>
<p>“青年進行曲”早已開工大吉，史東由對此戲下過從來所未有之功夫，女主角胡萍接到劇本後，曾在家研讀一星期，謝絕一切交際，足不出戶，同時各方面都甚重視“青年進行曲”。</p>
<p>“壯志凌雲”定廢歷元旦在南京首都大戲院及上海之中央，市南兩院開映，在南京，國防電影必受特別重視。</p>
<p>陳娟娟參加“瀟湘夜雨”，演貂斑華金由之女兒，有重要演出。</p>
<h3>“醉生夢死”今日公演</h3>
<p>業餘劇人第三次公演之最後一個節目“醉生夢死”，於今日起上演，此劇由沈西苓，宋子的改編導演，故事十分現實，由袁牧之，趙丹，施超，顧而已，藍蘋，李清，吳湄，呂班，李林等主演，日期怱促，只演兩天，為免觀衆向隅，每天於五时半增加一塲云。</p>

<p>Tokyo Correspondence</p>
<h3>Leaping Japan</h3>
<p>— Nagumo</p>
<p>"If a war breaks out, how will the food problem be solved?"</p>
<p>This question was posed by the Tokyo Yomiuri on January 8th, specifically to Japanese women. The reason for raising this question is:</p>
<p>The European storms, the turmoil in China, may cause war at any moment. Japan is a country notoriously lacking in food, so it is necessary to prepare in advance. If a war breaks out, the rural youths who produce food will inevitably be sent to the front lines, and all food industries will be transformed into military industries. Even if the country has some food reserves, they must be used to supply the soldiers at the front. Therefore, Japanese women should use this time to plan ahead, diligently study methods of storing and conserving food at home, to avoid excessive panic in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, he argued that when war breaks out, the government should establish a "Food Ministry." The main task of the "Food Ministry" would be, first, to transport the abundant food from Manchuria to Japan for the Japanese to consume. At the same time, it would implement consumption conservation, production allocation, control, and durable storage methods to prevent food panic after the war is prolonged.</p>
<p>After reading such a proposal, one cannot help but be reminded of "Leaping Japan."</p>
<p>"Leaping Japan"! Those five words are seen too often by people living in Japan. "Leaping" is originally a good word, but seeing it too much can cause special feelings and mental trembling.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>Also this year (around January 3rd), a so-called "poet" named Hakushū Kitahara published a book of national songs entitled "Songs of Leaping Japan." It contains a collection of 145 songs. Newspaper advertisements consider this to be "the culmination of Japanese songs, a great driving force to inspire the wind and clouds and promote national fortune."</p>
<p>Yes, "Inspire the wind and clouds"! "Leaping Japan" currently needs to "inspire the wind and clouds." If the wind is calm and the clouds are still, from where can Japan leap? Therefore, in this collection of songs claimed to be collected by a poet, "Develop Manchuria, "Glorious Korea," "Comfort the Kwantung Army," "Greater East Asia Alliance Song"...etc., are all collected inside, and are considered important songs for the promotion of Japan.</p>
<p>Songs are originally reflections of the people. But if ordinary people are considerate of the government's painstaking efforts and use the power of politics to create songs, that is a different story.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>That's right, Japan is "leaping." Look, public agencies, entertainment venues, where isn't "Leaping Japan" written? This is Japan's self-praise in recent years, and it seems to be able to boast. I remember when I first arrived in Japan, there was a shortage of leather goods, and it cost a lot of money to buy a coat collar. But now? Because of the so-called "Manchukuo," industrial development, and trade promotion, there are already many leather goods in Tokyo's department stores. Modern Japanese women, just by looking at the leather goods they wear, can also taste the meaning of "Leaping Japan," right?</p>
<p>Many things that did not exist before are now available, and this "leap" is enough to boast about. However, in order to maintain this "leap" and strengthen this "leap," the budget must leap, taxes must leap, "labor intensification" must leap, the import of military raw materials must leap, and social prices must also leap.</p>
<p>Increasing the burden on the general public has become unavoidable in today's "Leaping Japan." The decisive factor for the victory or defeat of the "leap" is mainly military strength. If military strength is inferior to others, then the so-called "leap" is probably just a flash in the pan. Since 1937, both the Washington Treaty and the London Treaty have expired, and the naval competition among the great powers has entered an era without constraints. Japan's ideal enemy for its navy is the United States. The United States has fifteen battleships, Japan only nine. The United States has fifteen class A cruisers, Japan only twelve. The United States has two hundred and twenty-one destroyers, Japan only ninety-six. The United States has eighty-five submarines, Japan only fifty-seven. Japan can only compete with the United States with aircraft carriers and Class B cruisers. But relying only on the strength of these two types of warships is too poor, so the Japanese naval authorities cannot but advocate "leaping ship construction," right? But the problem is that the United States is also "leaping," so the future of this "leap" is endless.</p>
<p>Speaking of the air force and the army, Japan's ideal enemy, needless to say, everyone knows is the Soviet Union. Now, let's compare the military preparations of Japan and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the army: the Soviet Union has 1.6 million soldiers, Japan only 250,000. The Soviet Union has 4,000 tanks, Japan only 150. The Soviet Union has 1,000 armored vehicles, Japan only 80. The Soviet Union has 1,500 anti-aircraft guns, Japan only 80.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about the air force: the Soviet Union has 5,000 military aircraft, Japan only 1,800. The Soviet Union has 1,000 civilian aircraft, Japan only 152. As for the navy, the Soviet Union's current naval power is also more than half the strength of the Japanese navy (the above comparison of various military preparations is based on the "Hinode" New Year issue). Moreover, the Soviet Union's budget for this year has also increased by more than two-tenths compared to last year's defense spending, which shows that "Leaping Japan" still needs to "leap" greatly.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>Perhaps it is also because of the leap that Japan has added many activities and also added more contradictions. The number of unemployed people has not decreased compared to before, and the number of people enjoying themselves has shown a special phenomenon this year. The number of people who went to Meiji Shrine (in Tokyo) on New Year's Day increased by 130,000 compared to last year (820,000 last year, 950,000 this year). However, the number of New Year's Day travelers at Tokyo Station, which is the main gateway of Tokyo, decreased by about 10,000 compared to last year. However, Tokyo Station's fare revenue did not suffer any losses as a result. The reason is: there are especially many luxury travelers going to Ise, Atami, Izu, and Hakone and other famous places this year. Japanese newspapers say: "This is good evidence of the economic situation this year" (Tokyo Asahi - January 3). In fact, it would be more appropriate to say that it is a crippled economic situation of the military industry. The public's pockets are emptier than last year. Many people were able to go to nearby places through Tokyo Station last year, but this year they can only wander around Tokyo. On the other hand, a small number of people who have benefited from the military industry are even more generous than last year, running to Atami, running to Hakone, and running to farther places to savor their own economic situation.</p>
<p>This month's 21st is the date of the opening of the 70th Japanese Parliament. In the annual parliament, political parties are bound to raise many questions, question the government, and make things difficult for the government, in order to enhance their own prestige. This is originally a formality and has become a custom. But this time's parliament can not help but give people a sense of "the storm is coming, the wind is filling the building." The conflict between the military and the political parties, the contradiction between the political parties and the government, the degree of its intensification, is indeed more "leaping" than before.</p>
<p>In the upcoming parliament, the main issues that political parties are preparing to attack the government are: first, the diplomatic issue, second, the tax increase issue, and third, the nationalization of electricity issue. Regarding the diplomatic issue, the government also seems to admit that it has failed considerably and is currently requesting self-defense countermeasures in an attempt to ease the political parties' fierce attacks. As for the tax increase issue and the nationalization of electricity issue? Because it represents the intention of the military to establish a "quasi-wartime economic system," the military has already expressed its opinion and is determined to support the government. If the political parties want to actively oppose it, even if the parliament is dissolved, they will not hesitate to do so (Tokyo Yomiuri - January 6). In this way, the political parties cannot help but be alarmed. Attacking the government is originally a custom, but offending the military, one cannot but be concerned.</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>In reality, only the Japanese military can most straightforwardly recognize the truth about "Leaping Japan." The vision of bureaucratic political parties is not good enough. An imperialist country, if it wants to "leap," it can only develop outward. If it cannot develop outward, then what is it "leaping" for? The "September 18th" Incident, seizing Manchuria overnight, was indeed a great leap for Japan. The name "Leaping Japan" was established from that time.</p>
<p>After "September 18th," with a light foot, it leaped into the Great Wall again. "Leaping!" "Leaping!" Although the "leap" was successful, the future of the leap is also full of difficulties. The military preparations are so far behind those of other powerful countries, what kind of "crocodile tears" are you bourgeois political parties still crying? Without increasing taxes, how can the budget be increased, and without increasing the budget, how can military preparations be strengthened? Needless to say, we still want to "leap" again. Even just to maintain this victory that has already been obtained, it is necessary to actively expand military preparations and leap even more.</p>
<p>"Leaping" has difficulties and easiness. To the north of Manchuria is the Soviet Union, and on the Soviet border, the Kwantung Army cannot leap one step. Last year, the border conflicts between Russia and Manchuria, I can't remember how many times it was. To the west of Manchuria is Outer Mongolia, and it should be easy to leap into Outer Mongolia, but it cannot be done either. So then comes a great leap in diplomacy, which is the world-shaking "Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany." Look, crossing the Soviet Union, crossing Poland, going far away to talk about anti-communism with President Hitler, what is this if not a great leap in diplomacy?</p>
<p>It is not only to strictly prevent the communists in one's own country, but also to go one step further and prevent communists for other countries. This is also "leaping."</p>
<p>○○○</p>
<p>"Leaping Japan's" attitude towards China is also leaping. Before the Xi'an Incident occurred, it had already decided to adopt a "power-based" "use of force" approach towards China. But from December 13th to 25th, it suddenly adopted a wait-and-see attitude. From December 26th to January 5th of the New Year, it said that it would switch from waiting and watching to taking strict monitoring. Since the 6th, it has suddenly declared its determination to use "power-based" "use of force." Although this is based on the changes within China and jumping around, from this jumping around posture, one can also see the leap of "Leaping Japan's" policy towards China.</p>

<h3>Obstacles to the Anglo-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Anglo-American cooperation is the most effective way to achieve world peace. Business cooperation between England and America is the most fundamental condition for friendship between England and America. Today, as Europe and Asia are filled with war crises, the British Minister of Commerce, Runciman, goes to Washington to negotiate an Anglo-American reciprocal trade agreement and other issues of cooperation between the two countries. Of course, it is worth our attention. Runciman's mission to the United States seems to be very important. Regarding the trade agreement issue, the currency issue, the disarmament agreement issue, the American Neutrality Act issue, the world's redistribution of raw materials issue, and even the unemployment issue, all have been discussed with the American Secretary of State Hull and President Roosevelt. Although the scope of discussion is wide, the foundation of the negotiations is very close. However, before Runciman can complete his mission, there is an obstacle that he must first break. This is America's neutrality policy.</p>
<p>England now very much needs the cooperation of the United States. To obtain the understanding of the United States means that England must sacrifice a little in business and diplomacy. It is not unwilling. But it wants the United States to guarantee that when England is caught in an international dispute, the United States will not undermine it or disrupt its plans. The ongoing new American Neutrality Act is what worries England the most. The current Neutrality Act expires at the end of February. Radical elements in the American Congress want to enact a more extreme law to stop the export of American goods, including not only military weapons and supplies, but also raw materials such as kerosene, cotton, wheat, copper and iron, once there is a war internationally. This is tantamount to giving up all of America's wartime foreign trade. England is the country most likely to get involved in international disputes. At the same time, it is the country that most needs economic assistance from the United States. Suppose England and America sign a reciprocal trade agreement, and British factories use American cotton as raw material, and the British people use American wheat and pork as food. Once this habit is formed, America suddenly says, "Because we are afraid of being drawn into the vortex of war, we will no longer provide the British with necessities such as cotton, wheat, coal, and iron." In this situation, England may either sit still and wait for death, allowing the enemy to win the war, or regard the United States as an enemy and send warships and planes to bomb the United States. Economic severance is even more harmful than a declaration of war in the current situation. If the United States wants to promote a neutrality policy, it cannot hope that England will lower tariffs and supply the market with American exports. If the United States wants to cooperate economically with England, it must guarantee that it will not adopt an overly extreme neutrality policy. Therefore, the neutrality policy is the biggest obstacle to the Anglo-American reciprocal trade agreement.</p>
<p>If wise American politicians know that it is no longer the 17th century and that international economic cooperation is the best way to solve America's domestic economic panic, perhaps this obstacle may be overcome.</p>
<h3>Former Japanese Army Minister General Hayashi Succeeds in Forming a Cabinet</h3>
<p>[Military's Attitude Remains Tough] Ugaki's Efforts Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Although Ugaki exhausted all his efforts to form a cabinet, he failed to find room for compromise and finally entered the palace at 11:50 this morning to pay his respects to the Emperor and decline the cabinet-forming mandate. (29th, Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After Ugaki declined the mandate to form a cabinet, the Emperor ordered Hayashi Senjuro, former Army Minister in the Okada cabinet, to form a cabinet late tonight. Ugaki gave up his efforts to form a cabinet after repeatedly trying to dispel the military's opposition without success.</p>
<p>General Hayashi is 61 years old. Before becoming Army Minister in 1934, he held various important positions in the army. In September 1935, he resigned as Army Minister. When the September 18th Incident broke out, he was the Commander-in-Chief of the Korean Army, believing that Manchuria urgently needed reinforcements. Without obtaining the government's approval, he rashly sent troops to Manchuria. However, this move was not approved by the government afterwards. After holding an emergency meeting, the cabinet ordered the troops that had been sent out to be recalled. Hayashi is taciturn and lacks hobbies, is loyal to his duties, and has no political ambitions. (29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Around what time tonight, Interior Minister Yuasa returned to Tokyo from Okitsu, carrying a letter of recommendation from Prince Saionji to see the Emperor. The Emperor immediately issued a decree to former Army Minister General Hayashi Senjuro to organize a new cabinet. Before the decree was issued, Yuasa had a long discussion with Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichiro. (29th, Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japan's newly appointed Prime Minister, General Ugaki, gave up his efforts to form a cabinet today due to the continued obstacles from the military. Ugaki was ordered to form a cabinet five days ago, but due to military opposition, he refused to recommend candidates for the new cabinet's Army Minister. Although he repeatedly tried to mediate, it was still ineffective. Military leaders declared that any attempt by the new Prime Minister would be futile, and that the situation was like stirring hard cement with bamboo chopsticks. (29th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Now that General Ugaki has resigned from the mandate, the question is who will be given the mandate to organize the successor cabinet. Given the fact that General Ugaki's cabinet formation work failed, judging from the current situation and the observations from all sides, the first considered most powerful person is Privy Council President Hiranuma Kiichiro, followed by former Army Minister General Hayashi Senjuro and former Navy Minister Admiral Osumi Mineo. (29th, Domei Electric)</p>
<h3>General Hayashi Senjuro</h3>
<h3>Ugaki Passively Protests and Resolves to Resign from the Rank of General</h3>
<p>Legally Requires the Army Minister's Consent; Hayashi Announces a Bomb Shell Statement; The Military Is Angry and Demands a Serious Investigation</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since Ugaki received the mandate to form a cabinet on the night of the 24th, he has won widespread sympathy. After 120 hours of struggle, he finally felt that he had failed to obtain the understanding of the army and had fallen into a serious state, and had no choice but to resign. All parties deeply regret and worry about this situation. After Ugaki decided to resign from the mandate to form a cabinet last night, he also decided to resign from the rank of retired army general to clarify the responsibility for causing the army's opposition. This move can be regarded as a passive protest against the army. Ugaki's confidant, Reserve Army Lieutenant General Hayashi Ya Saburokichi, issued a so-called bomb shell statement this morning, criticizing the army's attitude very harshly. The army authorities were very angry and believed that it had damaged the military's reputation and demanded a serious investigation into the matter. Observers here had already anticipated that Ugaki had given up hope of forming a cabinet before Ugaki entered the palace to see the Emperor this morning. In Japanese history, this is the second time that a cabinet-forming mandate has been aborted due to this phenomenon (according to the 1914 Kiyoura cabinet formation, it was aborted because it failed to obtain a candidate for Navy Minister). As for the extremely complex situation that caused Ugaki's failure, it cannot be explained clearly in a few words. However, insightful observers believe that the direction of Japan's political trend and the driving force of politics have been fully revealed at this time, and one thing can be noted: it is precisely because of Ugaki's failure that the task of his successor may be easier. (29th, Central News Agency Electric)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki resigned from the mandate on the 29th, and at the same time, taking this cabinet formation as an opportunity, in view of the situation expressed within the army, he considered it inappropriate to retain the position of army general, so he expressed his determination to resign from the rank of general. However, no procedures have been taken with the Army Ministry today, because according to Article 3, Paragraph 1 of the Army Officer Law, to resign from an official position, a letter of resignation must be submitted, and the Army Minister must also agree on the responsibility of supervision. Therefore, the Army Ministry will wait for the submission of the letter before taking appropriate action. (29th, Domei Electric)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki was opposed by the army as soon as he was ordered to form a cabinet, causing the cabinet formation to be aborted. He had to resign from the mandate, and on the 28th, he decided to resign from the position of army general as well, and submitted a letter of resignation to Army Minister Terauchi. Therefore, Army Minister Terauchi and Director-General of Education Sugiyama met at the Army Minister's official residence at 3:30 pm on the 29th to discuss the above issue. (29th, Domei Electric)</p>
<h3>Imaidada Discusses the Cabinet Formation Process</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] After General Ugaki resigned from the mandate, Imaidada Kiyotoku spoke to a group of reporters at 1:30 pm as follows:</p>
<p>We believe that if we cannot promote the reality of national unity, we cannot manage the situation. Therefore, we have implemented the thorough coordination and satisfactory policy to the end, but after all, we have had to resign from the mandate. During this period, we have caused anxiety in all circles due to the delay, and we are deeply sorry. Our actions will be based on following the correct path, attempting to achieve national unity in order to open up the situation. As for involving others or stimulating others, we will try our best to avoid it. The result of our efforts this time has been in vain, and we are truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Regarding the statement of Lieutenant General Hayashi Ya Saburokichi, it is said that it was not the intention of the cabinet formation headquarters. According to his statement, the statement of Lieutenant General Hayashi was made after the resignation was announced. We heard that it was the personal action of Lieutenant General Hayashi, and we were completely unaware of it. As for the fact that Lieutenant General Hayashi visited General Kawai, the cabinet formation headquarters was also unaware of it. All that we have taken so far is the correct path, and as for the fact of individual negotiations, there is absolutely nothing like that in the cabinet formation headquarters, etc. (29th, Domei Electric)</p>
<h3>The Democratic Political Party Announces a Statement</h3>
<p>Hoping to Respect Constitutional Government and Expressing Sympathy for Ugaki</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the situation of General Ugaki's resignation from the mandate, the Democratic Political Party held a meeting of executives at the residence of President Machida, and according to information from all sides, they discussed countermeasures for the future. As a result, a statement was issued in the form of its Secretary-General, Nagai Susumuwa, as follows:</p>
<p>Since General Ugaki was ordered to form a cabinet, he has worked hard, but because of differences of opinion with the army, he had no choice but to resign from the mandate. At this time of internal and external difficulties, the political situation has still not stabilized, which is regrettable. We cannot help but express sympathy for General Ugaki's plight. We believe that the army should clearly state the reasons for opposing General Ugaki's cabinet formation in order to make the people understand their dispute. What we expect is that no matter who succeeds in forming a cabinet, they should follow the great meaning of constitutional politics, stand on the public opinion of the people, and form a strong cabinet so as to quickly overcome the difficult situation, reassure the Emperor, and pacify the people. Our party will, according to the statement we have already made, seriously monitor the development of the situation together with the people, etc. (29th, Domei Electric)</p>
<h3>Ugaki (right) Who Failed to Form a Cabinet, and Army Minister Terauchi</h3>
<h3>Army Firmly Expresses Determination to Implement Active Policy</h3>
<p>No Compromise with Existing Political Parties</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Following General Ugaki's rise to form a cabinet, regardless of who it may be, the army will, upon negotiation and recommendation of the Minister of the Army, present the following conditions and compel their implementation:</p>
<p>㊀ A profound understanding of the current situation is required, implementing a new administration to stabilize the national livelihood and enhance national strength. ㊁ Strengthening national defense and military preparedness is the most important national policy of Japan, and must be promoted to achieve this ideal. ㊂ The administrative structure of the central and local governments must be reformed. ㊃ A comprehensive control mechanism for national policy must be promptly established at the central level. ㊄ Establish an internal cabinet personnel control mechanism. ㊅ Reform the parliamentary system. ㊆ Revise the electoral district law to thoroughly cleanse and purify the political arena. ㊇ Absolutely reject politics that compromise and mix with existing political parties. Judging from the above situation, the army will never adopt a policy of maintaining the status quo. It is sincerely hoped that talented individuals with a reformist consciousness will form a cooperative cabinet to deal with this extraordinary period and realize the ideal of national progress. (29th Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Hayashi Yasamichi, a close associate of General Ugaki involved in forming the cabinet, visited General Kawai Isoo, a senior army officer, on the 28th to report on General Ugaki's cabinet formation process and his determination, and to request cooperation. General Kawai replied that at this critical juncture, he hoped General Ugaki would act with self-restraint. (29th Allied Press Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After receiving a letter from General Ugaki expressing his significant resolve, General Suzuki Soroku, starting from the 27th, avoided the turmoil of the current situation and went to Ibaraki Prefecture to give lectures, and is scheduled to return to Tokyo on the 30th.

<h3>Japanese Ambassador to France Returns Home to Report on Duties</h3>
<p>Talks with French Reporters on the European Situation</p>
<p>Marseilles Port: Japanese Ambassador to France, Sato, returned home to report on his duties. He arrived here today from Paris and boarded the Japanese mail ship "Ankoku Maru" bound for Yokohama. Before departing, he gave an interview to a Havas News Agency reporter, describing his three years in office and the friendship between France and Japan in great detail. Finally, the reporter inquired about his views on the European situation. Sato declined to offer a comprehensive assessment but said, "I can only evaluate the European situation from the perspective of the Far East. I am not overly pessimistic. Europe currently has two systems: authoritarianism and democracy. However, if the rulers of all countries, regardless of their beliefs, hold peaceful aspirations, then why can't peace be achieved? However, if some countries still lack the will for peace, there will still be many difficulties ahead for peace. I firmly believe that well-informed individuals everywhere remember the last World War, when humanity slaughtered each other for four years. We certainly do not want to see a repeat of that carnage. I dare not believe that there are still people who want to replay the tragedy of the World War, because war is not only unhelpful but only destroys everything. Therefore, I believe that peace is a treasure of mankind and must be preserved." (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Twelve U.S. Navy Aircraft Arrive in Honolulu</h3>

The twelve aircraft carried a total of eighty people and traveled 2,553 miles from San Diego to Honolulu, taking 21 hours and 53 minutes. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>United States Considers Permanent Neutrality</h3>
<p>Authorities Draft Bill</p>
<p>[Washington] The current U.S. Neutrality Act is about to expire. Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and Representative McReynolds, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, have both drafted new Neutrality Bills, preparing to submit them to Congress for discussion, and advocating for a ban on the transportation of raw materials to belligerent nations. It is learned that after British Trade Minister Runciman recently came to the United States and held talks with Secretary of State Hull, the U.S. government has decided to abandon the proposal to ban the transportation of raw materials to belligerent nations. President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and former Disarmament Conference Representative Davis considered this matter for many days. Finally, because the United States almost entirely imports the rubber, tin, and nickel it needs from the territories of the British Empire, if a new Neutrality Act were implemented and raw materials were banned from export, then Britain would respond with retaliatory measures. Since Runciman made no secret of this, the U.S. government has cancelled the ban on exporting raw materials. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Draft Plan for Monitoring Spanish Sea and Land Borders</h3>
<p>Adjustment Committee Submits to Relevant Governments, Implementation Scheduled After Receiving Replies</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this afternoon and decided to submit a draft proposal for implementing monitoring of the Spanish sea and land borders (the sea monitoring plan to be implemented with the assistance of the naval fleets of various countries) to the governments of relevant countries and request that they submit their replies by February 4th. In addition to the above draft proposal, the subcommittee also decided to submit a questionnaire to the governments of relevant countries, listing the following questions: ㊀ Should the arrival of foreign volunteer soldiers in Spain and the transportation of military supplies to Spain be monitored? ㊁ Should land monitoring be conducted on the border between Spain and France, the border between Spain and Portugal, and the British territory of Gibraltar? ㊂ Should all Spanish ports be monitored? ㊃ Should all ships traveling to Spain be monitored? ㊄ Should the coast of Spain be monitored by the naval fleets of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany? Should the governments of relevant countries agree to the above five measures, they should fill out and answer each item. In addition, it is heard that the questionnaire also included suggestions regarding the date of implementation of the monitoring. It is expected that the subcommittee will meet next Tuesday to decide on the date of implementation of the monitoring, as the replies from the governments of various countries should have been received by then. Furthermore, individuals close to the delegations of various countries attending the Adjustment Committee are deeply concerned that this proposal will be thwarted again due to Portugal's opposition. During the subcommittee meeting today, the Portuguese representative stated that this monitoring method does not carry a kind of "trick," but he clarified that this was his personal opinion and that he would still submit the subcommittee's draft proposal to his government. What decision his government will make cannot be predicted. In addition, the representatives of Italy and Germany did not raise any objections to the subcommittee's proposals, which is quite noteworthy. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteer soldiers from going to Spain to serve, after the German government sent a reply to the British government a few days ago, the British Ambassador to Germany visited Foreign Minister Neurath today to express gratitude and inform him that the London Adjustment Committee will consider the suggestions made in the German reply. (Note: The most important of Germany's suggestions is that ㊀ the Adjustment Committee should immediately find a way to enable the main relevant countries to establish an agreement on the main measures for non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, their implementation dates, and the various principles of the future monitoring system; ㊁ the military personnel of various countries currently assisting in the war in Spain must be withdrawn.)

<h3>German Policy Toward Spain to Change</h3>
<p>[London] A reporter for the News Chronicle in Berlin claims that he sent out a message last week stating that German Aviation Minister General Göring had suggested to Mussolini during a recent visit to Rome that Germany and Italy jointly send 80,000 troops to Spain to assist in the war. The authorities in Berlin were furious after this message was sent, so he was not allowed to attend the Reichstag meeting tomorrow as a punishment. However, a certain diplomat has confirmed this message. The reason for the Berlin authorities' anger is that the German government's policy on the Spanish issue has changed and it does not want to recklessly do things that contradict the above message.

<h3>Soviet Prosecutor Demands Death Penalty for Seventeen Defendants</h3>
<p>Two Scientists and Artists, Unanimously Demanding Severe Punishment, Trotsky's Sister and Nephew Arrested</p>
<p>[Moscow] Regarding the Trotskyite counter-revolutionary case, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court has concluded the trial of the seventeen defendants. Chief Prosecutor Vyshinsky presented the indictment, using extremely strong language, essentially making the defendants' conspiracies and atrocities into an ironclad case that cannot be overturned. It stated that the defendants betrayed their country, undermined the socialist system, colluded with fascists, and established a branch of the German secret police. The evidence is overwhelming and indisputable. They deserve the death penalty. In particular, the defendant Pyatakov opposed Lenin as early as 1915 and tried to sabotage the Brest-Litovsk Treaty. He was also the organizer of the "Parallel Center" organization and other sabotage activities. His conclusion was that these people were murderers who secretly colluded with foreign countries to make their country submit and surrender. Then, the lawyers for the defendants began their defense. The lawyer for Knyazev, Belotkov, said that the real culprits were Trotsky and Japanese espionage agencies. The defendant Knyazev has now sincerely repented and asked the court to be lenient. Another defendant, Arnot's lawyer, Gasnachev, said that Arnot joined the Trotskyites out of fear due to blackmail and threats to his life from the Trotskyites, but he did not commit any crimes and should be granted leniency by the court. (29th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] When the prosecutor spoke, Radek, Pyatakov, and Sokolnikov all lowered their heads to their chests and covered their faces with their hands. The prosecutor made a fist-shaking gesture towards the three and rebuked them, saying, "You are all Trotskyite bandits who are willing to sell Soviet Russia to Japan and Germany." The prosecutor also denounced the heinous crimes of the defendants and called them "Trotskyite conspirators." Finally, he directly addressed Radek and Pyatakov, saying, "You have committed extremely serious crimes. You have become the vanguard of the fascist international." (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] During the public trial today, Radek and Pyatakov both confessed to conspiring to sell Soviet Russia to foreign countries. Both Radek and Pyatakov were willing to be executed. Pyatakov even expressed regret that Trotsky was still at large and unable to share their guilt. Finally, he asked the court to believe that he was no longer a Trotskyite at the time of his death. Radek's attitude was different. He claimed that he should be fully responsible for the crimes he committed and did not need to be incited by Trotsky. He once called Judge Ulrikh "comrade," which was rebuked by Ulrikh. Finally, Radek turned to the foreign reporters listening in the courtroom and shouted, "I have secretly planned an international disaster." Sokolnikov, who previously served as the ambassador to Britain, was the first among the defendants to request leniency. When he finished his confession, he said tearfully, "My crime deserves death, but I ask the judge to consider the circumstances." (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Nineteen well-known Soviet scientists, including Academician Komarov of the Academy of Sciences, research scholars Bakh, Keller, Arkhangelsky, Vavilov, Gubkin, Krzhizhanovsky, etc., recently published an open letter demanding that the court severely punish the traitors and strictly investigate and prosecute Bukharin, Rykov, and Uglanov for their participation in Trotskyite activities. The letter stated, "We will use all our knowledge and ability to further promote the rapid development and prosperity of our great socialist motherland and further consolidate the power of the Red Army, the true guardians of our Soviet borders." Forty-three well-known painters and sculptors, including Gerasimov, Yuon, Moor, Lansere, Grabar, Favorsky, Makulov, Mendeleev, etc., declared, "All the people of the Soviet Union who love their free country unanimously demand that the fascist poisonous snakes be completely eliminated from now on, that the Trotskyite stains in Soviet Russia be cleared away, and that solidarity be strengthened to support the leaders of all parties and governments and the national beloved leader Stalin." Forty-five thousand workers, engineers, and technicians from the Moscow Automobile Plant declared, "Our response to the conspiracies of the counter-revolutionary Trotskyites and rightists is to unanimously exert all our efforts to fulfill the tasks we have set for ourselves in 1937. We will increase labor productivity by 24 percent. We will reduce defective products and launch a broad struggle to enable all manual workers to obtain the experience of Stakhanov workers." Female switch operator Nagovitsyna wrote to Prosecutor Vyshinsky, "Because I rescued a train loaded with stove medicine from danger at the Zhusovskaya station, my legs were crushed. The destructive hands of the saboteurs moved the switch to connect with the tracks where the train was stopped. As a result, the station's destruction and the deaths of thousands of hundreds of people would have been inevitable, but I finally fulfilled my responsibility and avoided this terrible danger. Now I know who took my legs and prepared this terrifying danger. They took my legs, but they cannot take away my happiness. I am enjoying the happy life of a happy daughter of our motherland. I am only twenty years old, and I will curse their names for the rest of my life. I ask you to demand that the murderers be sentenced to death in your speech." (28th TASS Telegram)</p>

The declaration stipulated in this section of the bill shall be sent to the Privy Council and notified to the governments of the various dominions and the government of India. The bill further stipulates that if the monarch or regent has a mental or physical illness, but is not completely unable to fulfill his duties, and if the monarch or regent is not in the country, or intends to leave the country, in order to avoid delays or difficulties in public affairs, ministers may be appointed to fulfill their duties by letter.

The regent shall also manage the monarch's property. (28th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Portuguese Territory in Africa to be Managed by Germany - Portuguese Official Statement Denies It</p>
<p>[Paris] The "Journal" carries a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, stating that Germany and Portugal have recently signed an agreement stipulating that the Portuguese government should open its African colony of Angola on a broad scale to meet Germany's needs for colonization and management, while Portugal does not relinquish sovereignty over the colony. The agreement is valid for ninety-nine years. It is generally believed that Germany will provide Portugal with a large amount of goods, worth approximately 400 million gold marks, as compensation for granting this concession. According to the Journal's correspondent, this news is authentic and can be published without fear of denial. Furthermore, when German leader Hitler delivers his peace speech in the Reichstag on the 30th of this month, he may announce the conclusion of this agreement between Germany and Portugal, regarding it as "a great victory for peace," which is highly probable. The correspondent also stated that the agreement was negotiated by Mr. Huigert, director of the German Gold Discount Bank, who is now preparing to implement a similar plan for the French mandate territory of Cameroon, formerly a German colony before the war. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Lisbon Regarding the rumors that the Portuguese government has concluded an agreement with Germany to provide the Portuguese territory of Angola in Africa for German colonization and management, the Portuguese Prime Minister's Office has issued a public statement, resolutely denying it. However, it stated that negotiations are currently underway regarding the mutual exchange of raw materials produced in Portuguese colonies and German industrial products, and that an agreement has been reached, but the quantity is limited, far behind the trade volume between Germany and other countries.

<h3>Japanese Actively Promote Northeast Five-Year Gold Production Plan</h3>
<p>Adopting Large Amounts of Money to Replenish National Defense Finances - Implementing Continental Policy to Win Without Fighting</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence: Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese have been engaged in gold mining in the Northeast for five years. They have implemented their so-called five-year gold production plan starting this year, so this year is the sixth year. In the past, the Japanese believed that the first phase of</p>
<p>Foundation Construction has been completed. Now they are actively promoting the so-called second phase of the leap era, boasting that this will bring epoch-making progress to the Northeast's politics, economy, and finance. This is because they take the controlled economy as the foundation, and take the comprehensive national policy of Japan as the guideline for appropriate operation. As far as the Japanese gold mining industry is concerned, at the beginning of the establishment of the puppet organization, due to its special nature, it was placed under control, and thus achieved extraordinary</p>
<p>Progress. Looking at the amount of gold produced, the amount of gold produced under the control of Japanese companies was 507,000 yuan in the Japanese Showa 9th year (Republic of China 23rd year), 3.67 million yuan in the Japanese Showa 10th year (Republic of China 24th year), and 10 million yuan in the Japanese Showa 11th year (Republic of China 25th year), that is, the annual average increase is about three times the previous year. The Japanese are very optimistic about this, believing that if they continue in this way, the annual output will reach 100 million yuan, which is not far away. The Japanese also believe that they can have such good results because of their control. As for other</p>
<p>Reasons, the progress of the mining operations directly managed by Japanese companies, first, Xiaoshitou south of Jiamusi is mined by hand, and now there are about 7,000 gold miners. Under the control of Japanese companies, they are engaged in gold mining. In the past, Xiaoshitou was originally a small village with only dozens of houses. Later, the Japanese survey team discovered gold mines there, and summoned gold miners to mine, resulting in a concentration of population. Now the population has reached more than 20,000, actually a large town. The Japanese also set up all entertainment facilities in the area. The amount of gold produced is also very</p>
<p>Abundant. From January to December last year, it was 3.4 million yuan, accounting for more than one-third of the total gold production in the Northeast last year, because it has reached 400,000 to 500,000 yuan per month since August last year. There are also other discoveries of new gold mines. The Japanese have a hope that they will develop greatly in the future. Second, the Niaoqiu River in the Xiaoxinganling Mountains about 200 miles southwest of Heihe is suitable for the operation of gold dredging ships due to terrain. Since last year, construction has been carried out. It was completed at the end of October last year and has started</p>
<p>Mining. Because of its good results, the Japanese also believe that its future activity can be eagerly awaited. According to this type of gold dredging ship, its single bucket has a capacity of 5 cubic feet, weighs 700 tons, and is 540 horsepower. The mining capacity of one month can reach 120,000 cubic yards. The amazing mechanization of gold dredging ships can be described as a new era in the Japanese's ideal gold mining method in the Northeast. Currently, Japanese companies are continuing to add gold dredging ships. As for the energy of gold dredging ships, they are the same type as dredging ships. Gold mining equipment is installed on the top of the ship. Currently, the largest of the Japanese plans is a gold dredging ship with a volume of 15 cubic meters. Its</p>
<p>Hull is 45 meters long, 18 meters wide, 19.5 meters high, weighs 1,000 tons, has 1,200 horsepower, and has a monthly mining capacity of 400,000 cubic yards. Employees are divided into three shifts, day and night, and only 29 people are required to operate. Its mining capacity is equal to 7,000 gold miners. The Japanese have also discovered a large placer gold mine in Tumenzi. The placer gold there is different from the ordinary state, it is on the mountain. If you feel that there is not enough washing water, you can make a sluice gate at the high place of the water and use 200 feet or 300 feet of high falling water pressure to mine placer gold. The Japanese are currently</p>
<p>Preparing. Although this method has no precedent in Japan's mainland and Korea, when it is completed in the future, the amount of gold produced in the area will undoubtedly make an extraordinary leap forward. In addition, there are the Huma River Basin, the Aben'er River Basin, the Mudanjiang Aodi in Tangyuan County, and Huaxun County, etc. All very promising placer gold mines have been discovered by the Japanese one after another. As for mountain gold, there are Kaishantun on the border between Korea and the Northeast, and Qinglin in the Mudanjiang area. The Japanese have completed the survey and are now actively preparing to mine. All gold mining operations in the Northeast are planned based on the gold mining companies established by the Japanese, and they follow the Japanese national policy mission of the Northeast Five-Year Industrial Plan, so there is a five-year gold production plan.</p>
<p>Establish. The target of this plan, starting from this year, is 100 million yuan for the amount of gold produced. The first year is 14 million yuan, the second year is 22 million yuan, the third year is 36 million yuan, the fourth year is 55 million yuan, and the fifth year is 82 million yuan. However, the total amount of gold produced in the above five years is more than 200 million yuan, which is the amount of gold produced within the scope of Japanese companies. If the entire Northeast is included, such as the entry and participation of Japanese mainland capitalists, it is possible to reach 400 million or 500 million yuan. It is indeed the Japanese's plan to produce gold.</p>
<p>Progress is to actively prepare the national defense finance for the Japanese puppet international relations and to assist the implementation of Japan's large-scale immigration policy, and to raise huge funds for it. Furthermore, the financial situation in the Northeast is now in a malignant inflationary situation. The Japanese intend to expand their economic authority, so they urgently plan to</p>
<p>Replenish the gold mining plan, so that a large amount of money can be obtained to solve the urgent needs. The so-called replenishment of positive currency reserves to consolidate the fiscal foundation of the Japanese puppet state, increase national defense power can exert its huge combat power, and the so-called winning without fighting is the best policy. The so-called root of Japan's continental policy and the foundation of East Asian hegemony.</p>
<h3>Sungkiang Factory Owner's Wife Directs Robbery</h3>
<p>As the winter defense season arrives, and it is also the end of the lunar year, military police are densely deployed in the city and suburbs, with patrols never ceasing. However, at 11:00 AM on the 27th, Yang Zhenqing's house on Kuo Street outside the West Gate was actually robbed by a gang, which is shocking. Subsequently, Yang Shijie, the detective captain of the Public Security Bureau, tracked down and arrested three people on the same day: Xu Ronglin, Zhang Asan, and Zhu Kehong. They were taken to the bureau for preliminary interrogation. Xu Ronglin confessed that he was 25 years old, from Ningbo, and currently lived at No. 36 outside the South Gate of Jiashan. This time, he received a letter from Qian Gao, the wife of the owner of the Yun Jian Battery Factory in Songjiang, inviting him to Songjiang, explaining that she wanted to rob the Yang family. He summoned Zhang Asan and Zhu Kehong. They arrived in Songjiang on the 27th. After eating noodles at a noodle restaurant, Qian Gao pointed out the entrance of the Yang family. Another person, whose name is unknown, called the door to enter. First, they met a young master wearing glasses, and immediately tied him up, followed by tying up a young girl. However, there was another woman who ran upstairs to inform the neighbors that they had encountered thieves and called the police. Then, the person whose name is unknown robbed the gold chain around the old lady's neck. I immediately snatched it, ran out of the gate, and tied the gold chain to the account table of the battery factory. I hired a rickshaw to the railway station and escaped along the railway line. He was arrested by the detective team who were in hot pursuit. According to Yang's confession, he immediately searched the battery factory. As the thief was not found after a day, he brought Qian Gao to the case, and the robbers all identified him one by one. It was indeed Qian Gao who instigated it. However, Qian Gao still vehemently denied it. Everyone said that it was extremely daring and evil to carry out robberies in the bustling city. It is said that the authorities will punish him with military law to deter bandits.</p>
<h3>A Proposal Amidst the Prohibition of Opium in Taicang</h3>
<p>Lu Boquan, a local resident, wrote to Magistrate Wen yesterday, saying, "Thanks to the magistrate's combination of kindness and sternness, the opium prohibition in this county has indeed achieved remarkable results. It will not be difficult to completely eliminate it within the prescribed time limit. My admiration is beyond words. However, recently, the county hospital, due to the large number of opium addicts being persuaded and voluntarily giving up opium, has often heard of perfunctory actions. Recently, Li Axing, an opium addict from Zhitang Town in the sixth district, was persuaded to enter the hospital on December 19, 25th year, and was discharged from the hospital after giving up opium on the 30th of the same month, receiving a paper with the hospital's opium addict examination form No. 549 and an opium abstention certificate No. 1365. The ignorant opium addicts who are persuaded are deeply happy to regain their freedom at present, but they do not know that the crime of relapse after giving up opium has invisibly surrounded them, and there is no way to get rid of it. Opium addiction is not a matter of a day or two, and the difficulty of eradicating it is a hundred times greater than addiction. This is recognized by doctors and opium addicts. Now Li Axing can quit his chronic illness in a short time of one day and one night, who will believe it? When the follow-up is carried out in the future, punishing him with the crime of relapse would be too unjust. The only way to remedy it is to order Director Qiu by the magistrate to properly persuade Li Axing and similar opium addicts who have given up opium again to comply with the decree and respect humanity. If my humble suggestions are adopted, the poor opium addicts will kowtow nine times to thank you. Furthermore, after the opium addicts of the lower classes are discharged from the hospital, they are eager to start working, and they cannot avoid being caught in the legal net. The law cannot be forgiven, but the circumstances are still understandable. In the future, it is best to allow them to stay in the hospital for recuperation for a few days after giving up opium. This is an act of grace beyond the law, which I believe the magistrate will be happy to grant."</p>
<h3>Large Number of Opium Addicts Arrested in Suzhou</h3>
<p>The Wu County government was ordered to carry out a general re-examination of opium addicts, which has been completed. The Public Security Bureau immediately ordered the police stations in urban and rural areas to strictly arrest opium addicts. In recent days, more than a thousand people have been arrested, all of whom have been sent to the county government for disposal by the Public Security Bureau. The county government will re-examine those opium addicts who deny smoking, and order those who admit to smoking to abstain from opium before sentencing them to imprisonment according to law. Therefore, the opium addict detention centers and county hospitals have been overcrowded in recent days. In order to alleviate the situation, the county government will allow those who have been sentenced to imprisonment for six months or less to commute their sentences to fines. The Director of Public Security has issued a notice to all his subordinates to mobilize the entire force to arrest opium addicts in these three days from the 29th to the 31st. Anyone who is seen smoking in tea houses, restaurants, and public entertainment venues will be immediately arrested and sent to the county for investigation. On the 29th, in the urban area, the police stations arrested no less than 300 opium addicts, most of whom were disheveled and dirty. They were all sent to the bureau and then to the county for disposal.</p>
<h3>Changshu Citizens Correct the Tax Deed Office</h3>
<p>Recently, the Tax Office of the local county government has been imposing penalties on those whose house deeds have incomplete renovation accounts. Now, citizens such as Jin Shuhe and others believe that this is an improper action by the county government, and they have jointly presented a petition to the county, requesting correction. The reason is that recently, the county government taxes house deeds, and if it finds renovation deeds, regardless of whether they are old or modern, it orders them to pay taxes and penalties. However, after checking the provisional regulations for tax verification issued by the national government before November of the 16th year, there is no such provision. The current county government's actions clearly violate this, and the people suffer this extra loss, which is too much. It is reported that the county government has approved the matter for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Wuxi County-Wide Land Registration</h3>
<p>The local Land Administration Bureau has completed the land registration for the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh districts of the county. However, there are still a few owners who have not performed their obligations for a long time. Director Hu has decided to set a reminder period from February 1st to the 28th. All unregistered owners should quickly register within the deadline to avoid losing property rights. Also, the registration for the first district will begin in mid-February. Four land registration offices will be set up, and the bureau will send staff to verify the maps on-site and issue small tickets. Then, registration will be done with the tickets, and a registration fee of one cent will be charged. The remaining eighth, ninth, and tenth districts will begin around mid-February.</p>
<p>Establishment of the Ship Inspection Office</p>
<p>The local Public Security Bureau believes that water security is extremely important during this winter defense period. Therefore, Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau, together with Qian Zhongliang, the chief of the first district, established the Ship Inspection Office at the original site of the card office in front of Huangbudun Building, Louxia Building, outside the North Gate. A water patrol team member has been appointed to start inspections from today (30th) to maintain local security.</p>
<p>The Suzhou-Wuxi Road Opens to Traffic in One Day</p>
<p>The entire route of the Suzhou-Wuxi Road has been completed. The Suzhou Provincial Highway Administration has scheduled the official opening of traffic on February 1st. Mr. Tie Shanshan was dispatched to Wuxi in advance to prepare. The Suzhou-Wuxi Line Office is located at Beizhakou. All vehicles have also been transported to Wuxi and installed. The main station is attached to the Xicheng Company, and branch stations are set up in Huishan, Yinglong Bridge, Zhongqiao Town, Nanqiao Town, Zhouxin Town, Huadafangzhuang, Xin'an Town, Wangting, Tong'anqiao Town, Ertu Town, Guanqiao Town, and Shanren Bridge, etc. The 12 locations operate on the bus and stop along the way to benefit merchants.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Widens Streets in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>In order to prosper the urban market and facilitate transportation, the Wujin County government plans to widen North-South Avenue, Juqian Street, East-West County Heng Street, and Fu Zhi Street in the downtown area. After sending staff to measure, it was submitted to the political affairs meeting last month and approved. It was also stipulated that the width should be uniformly widened to 12 meters, including 7 meters for the roadway and 2.5 meters for the sidewalks on both sides. The road surface is paved with stone slabs. The county government is responsible for 40% of the funding, and the residents on both sides are responsible for 60%. The county government then prepared planning charts and submitted them to the Construction Department for verification and instructions. Yesterday, news was received from the province that the Construction Department had ordered the filing of this planning facility. After receiving the order, the county government immediately started to invite merchants to contract the project and implement the widening to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Bandits Rob in a Cart</h3>
<p>The house of Ding Wansong, a farmer in Zhuang Ertou, Yiling East Township, Sixth District of Jiangdu, was robbed at night on the 26th by seven bandits speaking with Qinghuai accent and local accent. They broke into the house by holding earthen guns and iron forks over the reed fence in the courtyard, rushed open the door, and three bandits dragged Ding and his wife out of the quilt and tied them up, forcing them to confess the location of the silver. They stabbed Ding's leg very deeply with an iron fork. The remaining bandits divided up clothes, foreign goods, and valuables, and loaded them into a cart they brought with them, and roared away. When the neighbors heard the alarm and beat gongs to call for help, the bandits had already fled far away. It is estimated that the loss was more than 500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Qita Temple Abbot Ascends the Throne</h3>
<p>Qita Temple in Jiangdong, Ningbo, is a well-known Buddhist monastery in eastern Zhejiang. The term of office of the abbot, Ning Chang, has expired. After public election by various branches, Zhizhen, the abbot of Dantuan Kan Jing Temple, was promoted. On the 27th, the new and old abbots went through the handover procedures. At 7 o'clock in the morning, a car was sent to pick him up. Tu Ying led people to the mountain gate, ascended the altar to perform the ascension ceremony and held rituals such as lecturing and chanting scriptures.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from a European Trip</h3>
<p>— Our European Correspondent, Lieshan</p>
<p>Sixteen - Performing Chinese Etiquette</p>
<p>Once, at a social gathering, I was introduced to a certain German middle school teacher, Mr. So-and-so. As usual, we exchanged names and shook hands. But after this gentleman shook hands, he just smiled at me without saying a word. Half a minute passed, then a minute passed. We were still just standing there. I thought, "Oh no, he's not a mute, but he doesn't seem like an idiot either. There must be some secret to this." I asked him if it was because it was the first time he had seen a Chinese person, so he was too frightened to speak. He found this strange. He was performing the most respectful Chinese etiquette towards me! How could I not understand? Ha, performing Chinese etiquette, running into someone and not saying a word – this was practically news! Apparently, he had read about it in a book, and it was described as a very grand etiquette, only used when meeting an official. I asked him, "When performing this kind of etiquette, how many minutes are both parties supposed to remain silent before speaking?" At that, it was as if I wasn't even Chinese, since I didn't even know this etiquette. He laughed. This one detail, the author apparently had not mentioned. I said, "Sir, look, this detail is very important. The author should not have forgotten to mention it. For example, if we had just kept performing Chinese etiquette without any time limit, we would have ended up mute!"</p>
<p>Seventeen - Chinese People Kiss with Their Noses</p>
<p>Many Chinese etiquettes, not only do we ourselves not know, but we can't even find any basis for them by scouring ancient books. But Europeans understand them very clearly. For example, Europeans say that Chinese people kiss with their noses.</p>
<p>Why do Chinese people use their noses to kiss? Is it because they are concerned about hygiene? In Europe, it seems impossible to find a definite answer. Even the famous writer Madame Buck only offers a negative explanation for this question. She only portrays how young Chinese men and women do not like to kiss, considering it a foreign custom. Since Madame Buck has said that Chinese people do not know about kissing, then Chinese people kissing with their noses is probably at least partly correct.</p>
<p>Chinese people living in Europe often spend a lot of time arguing over this "nose" issue.</p>
<p>I remember once, a classmate was invited by a certain foreign organization to give a lecture on the topic of "Chinese Customs." After the lecture, a lady stood up and asked him, "Is it true that Chinese people kiss with their noses?" This classmate was stunned for a moment, but immediately replied in a very playful tone, "Most respected lady, if you don't believe it, I can try it out on you right now!" This caused the entire audience to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Eighteen - Another Perspective</p>
<p>For decades, China has been accustomed to the oppression of imperialist guns and cannons. The general public has lost its self-confidence, always believing that domestic goods are inferior to foreign goods. Any foreigner, even a nobody, who comes to China is considered a "foreign master." The reason: things from abroad are always better.</p>
<p>The opposite is true of Europeans. In addition to considering themselves a superior race, they believe that everything from their own country is superior to that of others. It is not easy to get them to admire you. Unless you can knock them down to the ground, only then will they think you are a hero.</p>
<p>Recently, a great statesman has suddenly appeared in European newspapers. That is to say, a great statesman whom even Europeans admire. This statesman is Chinese: Mr. Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
<p>In the past, Chiang Kai-shek only occupied an ordinary position in European newspapers. People thought he was nothing more than a figure like Wu Peifu and Zhang Zuolin. But after the Guangdong-Guangxi problem was peacefully resolved and China was officially unified, on that very day, the European newspapers immediately changed their tone, as if they had discovered a new person. Suddenly, you would hear that China was reviving, and I would say that General Chiang Kai-shek was an incredible person, a brilliant military leader, a great statesman, and a great diplomat. Someone would say that General Chiang Kai-shek was already a key figure on the international political stage. Taking advantage of his fiftieth birthday, European newspapers all published special articles introducing him. Everyone said that he was the symbol of modern China, the only leader capable of saving China. This was the first time in history that a Chinese politician had gained international renown. It is embarrassing to say that we Chinese ourselves still do not have a clear understanding of Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. The reason, according to a British reporter, is because Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is not good at public speaking. But in the eyes of Europeans, Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is already a great man of the twentieth century. His position is the same as Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler, and General Kemal. As a German newspaper put it, his fate is the fate of the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>On October 29th of this year, the British Daily Telegraph published a long article introducing Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. One passage said that General Chiang Kai-shek has the ability of calm and far-sightedness. There are only a few people in the world who can be compared to him, but no one surpasses him.</p>

<h3>Inter-City Football Team Second Trial Today</h3>
<p>Ideal Team vs. China Team: 3:00 PM at Shen Garden, Rain Changes to Tomorrow; Group A Match: Jinan vs. St. Francis</p>
<p>The Shanghai team selection for the Hong Kong-Shanghai inter-city football match has been changed three times, reducing the team from seventeen to fifteen players. After the second trial match, there may be a final decision. The second trial match was scheduled for 3:00 PM today at Shen Garden. Due to Xu Yahui's return to Xiamen, the China team has also added Wang Kehou as a representative. All selected players from both sides will have the opportunity to play today. As usual, the most standard ideal lineup will appear first, and then the captain will assign appropriate players to substitute in. If the China team can fully respond and focus on their weaknesses, they may be able to show the heroic spirit of Innes last year. The China team has a total of sixteen players, with Donghua accounting for three-quarters, which is equivalent to a well-trained team. The inter-city team has complex members and has not had sufficient training opportunities, so cooperation is inevitably a makeshift. In terms of communication, the China team already has an advantage over the inter-city team. Players from both sides must arrive at the field before 2:30 PM. If it rains unfortunately today, the trial match will be postponed to tomorrow, and the location will still be Shen Garden. As for the league matches, there were originally two Group A matches today. Jinan will play against St. Francis. Portugal and West Merchants will clash tomorrow because some players are attending the inter-city trial match. The Group C match between Junior and Weitishi will be held today instead. The schedule for today and the list of players from both China and the inter-city team are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Zhu Qiliang Defeats Left-Handed General Zhu Qiliang Defeats Left-Handed General</h3>
<p>Finals Set for Four Matches Over Two Days Next Month (4th &amp; 5th); Won 1,000 to 626 Last Night</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Group A Championship, Zhu Qiliang defeated left-handed General Wu Chengxiang last night with a score of 1,000 to 626. He will compete with Zhang Yingda in four final matches over two days on February 4th and 5th, for a total of 2,000 points. The honor of champion and runner-up will be entirely occupied by Chinese players, creating an unprecedented record in the Shanghai billiards world.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiliang's victory last night was not as unpredictable as his victory over Ding Mingyi the previous night. The entire situation was under his control, and he safely reached his goal. The record of his shots was also very impressive. At the end of the first half, the score was 495 to 128.</p>
<p>Left-handed General Wu Chengxiang was not as good at shooting as usual, and his signature moves were greatly reduced. His luck was particularly bad, and he could hardly believe his performance. The second half was slightly better than the first half. His largest single shot of 45 points was also made in the second half.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiliang (First Half): 24•22•24•24•52•32•20•27•46•29•23• (Second Half): 38•45•25•26•78•46•</p>

<h3>Shen Garden Basketball Black Team Lost to Macklin Yesterday</h3>
<p>First Half 21 to 8, Total 45 to 34</p>
<p>There were two basketball games at Shen Garden yesterday. The first was between Liangxi and the Eagles in Group A, Part B. Liangxi's momentum was very strong, leading 18 to 13 in the first half, and ultimately winning 34 to 24. The second game was between the Black team and Macklin in Group A. The beginning was very even. Jia Youliang broke the record, and Kaiton tied the score. Xu Jusheng then led 4 to 2, and Pan Rose made it 4 to 4. After Xu Jusheng broke through with 6 to 4, Macklin's Locke and Brett exceeded them by making two scores. From then on, the Black team fell into a slump and was swept away by Macklin, ending the first half 21 to 8. The Black team was far behind. After the break, the Black team was unhappy internally, and Xu Jusheng announced his retirement, causing Macklin to add up to 30 to 10. After the Black team's Bai Qixilin made consecutive bullseyes, Zhang Shaoqing was also invincible. The score increased sharply, and at the closest point, it was chased to 29 to 38. At this time, Locke had been closely monitored by Zhang Shaoqing and had no development. The Black team had hopes of winning. Xu Jusheng also became a "married woman" again and made many contributions. However, in the last six minutes, Macklin's momentum suddenly turned strong again, and the Black team lost seven points in an instant. The score then moved to 45 to 29, and it was difficult to reverse the situation. Although the Black team's Xu and Zhang added another five points later, time waited for no one. The whistle had already sounded a long cry. Because the Black team lost too much in the first half, it was difficult to recover the lost ground. Although Kaiton had a foul opportunity at the end, Zhang Shaoqing was also depressed and missed the penalty. They were惨败 by Macklin with a score of 45 to 34. The Black team's luck was very bad yesterday. It is estimated that the ball hit the hoop and bounced out as many as sixteen times.</p>

<h3>Several Secondary Education Issues Related to English Teaching (3)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shijie</p>
<p>Third, secondary education should cultivate students' initiative, not only in academic research but also in dealing with matters. Students should develop a spirit of initiative so that after graduating from secondary education, they can study new knowledge if they go on to higher education, and create new careers if they go to work. In short, it is to cultivate students' ability to cope with changes. The ability to cope with changes I am talking about here is used in a very broad sense, not just referring to certain dangerous changes encountered in society. We spend years or more than a decade in school before entering society. The things we encounter in society, whether they are academic, professional, technical, or related to people, or even relations between countries, inevitably involve situations we have never experienced before. This is a broad sense of change. When such a situation occurs, the education that the person at the forefront has received, whether in school or outside of school, will encounter irreconcilable and uncompromising tests. No matter how many years a person has spent in school, it can only be determined whether he has received practical education training when he encounters this kind of test. This is true not only in terms of knowledge and skills, but also in terms of behavior and integrity, we are constantly encountering some tests of change to determine whether we have received practical training in cultivation. In this way, we can see that the cultivation of knowledge and the cultivation of conduct are inseparably linked. The curriculum in school should be regarded merely as a tool for cultivating this ability to cope with changes. Students who can only stick to the rules and do mechanical work cannot open up new territories in scholarship, cannot create new things in their careers, cannot shoulder great responsibilities in society, and cannot take advantage of opportunities to develop their own future or the welfare of society. Cultivating students' spirit of initiative in knowledge is a major key in the era of secondary education.</p>
<p>Fourth, secondary education should be adapted to the needs of the country and society. This issue should be considered from two aspects. On the one hand, secondary schools prepare students for further education, and on the other hand, they prepare students for entering society and working. People who run secondary education should plan these two aspects according to a standard so that both sides can be given equal consideration, and according to a systematic plan, so that the educational level of both sides can reach a minimum and most appropriate limit. The needs of the country and society, especially in China today, have basic requirements for these two aspects of secondary education that cannot be reduced. As everyone knows, the current classification of secondary schools is that middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools are run separately, concentrating the preparation for further education in middle schools and the training of vocational skills in vocational schools. This is a policy determined on the basis of many years of experience and determined to abandon the previous mixed system, and should not be changed lightly. However, judging from the current situation of secondary education in China, I am afraid that it is far from this goal. In recent years, Chinese secondary education has paid too much attention to the first aspect and almost completely ignored the second aspect, making secondary education biased towards further education and completely obliterating the aspect of preparing students to enter society and work. This extremely unreasonable trend can be seen from several things. First, there are too many middle schools and too few vocational schools and normal schools. According to the education statistics of the Republic of China in 1932, middle schools account for nearly 63% of the number of secondary schools in the country, normal schools account for less than 19%, and vocational schools account for less than 9%. Of the number of students in secondary schools across the country, 75 out of every 100 are middle school students, less than 19 are normal school students, and less than 7 are vocational school students. The distribution of funding for secondary schools also shows the same proportion. There are more than 500,000 students in secondary schools across the country, and more than 400,000 of them are middle school students. When the state runs education, it uses huge amounts of money and the hard work of countless people. At a minimum, it hopes that every young person who is about to become an adult can do something truly useful and beneficial in society. If these more than 400,000 young people all use their talents, how much good should they accumulate for society? However, it is a very big question whether the practical education that most students in general middle schools receive in six years can achieve this minimum purpose. Looking at the current situation of students in secondary schools going on to higher education, there are approximately 9,000 graduates from senior high schools, approximately 7,000 graduates from senior normal schools, and less than 3,000 graduates from senior vocational schools each year. In total, there are approximately 20,000 people. In principle, these 20,000 people are all qualified to apply to universities or vocational colleges. However, according to the statistics already known for the 25th year of the Republic of China, universities and vocational colleges across the country recruit a total of approximately 54,000 people each year, and less than 10,000 people are admitted, which is less than 18%. The total number of university students in the country is also only more than 40,000. According to these standards, 90% of the more than 400,000 middle school students do not have the opportunity to go on to higher education. Looking at the current equipment situation of general universities, it seems that they can only accommodate a part of the graduates of senior secondary schools with their maximum annual enrollment capacity. Since the rest of the graduates are out of school, they can only enter society and take up a new career. Although vocational training is not the responsibility of middle schools, the employment problem of these hundreds of thousands of middle school students cannot be ignored in the end. The training of middle schools, in terms of curriculum and conduct,</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Short covering and new long positions rise together, public bonds rise in a straight line.</p>
<p>Types C, D, and E each rise by more than one yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was in a state of boiling enthusiasm, and the upward trend became more intense. The Xi'an Incident has turned into a settlement, and the market's excitement about absorption is extremely strong. Both short covering and new long positions are very enthusiastic. The chips on the table are scarce. Therefore, under the vigorous atmosphere, market prices rose more sharply. Unified bonds all moved towards the high price of interest-bearing prices of one month. According to the brilliance of the situation, and the exuberance of popularity, the future progress should be endless. However, because the straight-line rise is too fast, I am afraid that a moderate reversal will occur. The opening of the market yesterday morning showed people's high spirits, and those who turned from short to long were extremely enthusiastic. Huge amounts of 50 and 43 were absorbed, and market prices suddenly rose by two to three cents to half a dollar. The upward trend in the secondary market was very prosperous. 50 and 16 continued to be bought, and 72 and 44 gradually came out. Unified C and other types all rose by five cents to three corners. The trend of the opening of the market in the afternoon was even more rising. 50, 5, and 11 were bought wildly again, and 14 and 72 were still sold. However, because people's hearts were agitated, market prices rose again by one cent to four and a half cents. At the close, the absorption on the table was more prosperous. The purchase of 5, 315, and 50 continued to surge. Type C continued to rise by five cents to three and a half cents. Type A of this month was slightly lower by five cents. Throughout the day, the result was a surge of seven or eight cents to one, four cents and three cents. Type A of this month was only four and a half cents. The total number of transactions was 1.1 million yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall of the highest and lowest prices is shown in the table on the left (unit yuan, transaction unit 100 yuan):</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Qingdao will auction off white cotton cloth.</p>
<p>Shanghai's inventory suddenly rose by a cent. The absorption of Shanghai goods on this street is still surging.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the cloth market was still good. The market rose more than it fell. In fact, the futures prices were high. Those who held the goods were at ease, and the silver and money industry accommodated mortgages. Domestic customers and colleagues on this street had a strong tendency to hoard. Qingdao will auction off white goods on February 18. The Huashang Huaxin Factory's Zhanqiao brand fine cloth will be the standard product, and the local Japanese-owned Gongda Factory's 12-pound Shuanglongzhu fine cloth will be designated as the same level. This method still uses the Japanese factory's Shuanglongzhu brand as the standard. The status of Japanese fine cloth in the Qingdao market far exceeds that of Chinese factories. It is heard that the Shanghai Japanese Yufeng Factory's Longtou fine cloth has been reduced by a cent, but the current selling price of Longtou in Shanghai often exceeds Shuanglongzhu by several cents to one cent, so there is a profit to be made, resulting in a sharp increase in the selling price of Qingdao goods in Shanghai (per piece) of one cent. Shanghai goods also rose due to the efforts of the dyeing factories on Hexing Street and the domestic help. Fine cloth increased by nine cents, 84 cloth increased by one cent, and fine twill was slightly firm, and the price was still stable. The customer sales of fine cloth from this factory have also turned around. Guangdong, Anhui, and this street all have a strong demand for about a hundred packages of flannel, broadcloth, and printed goods. This street and the domestic help are also actively searching for goods.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>January Delivery Amount and Its Process</p>
<p>Sino-Japanese War Gold Rooster Yarn for January was listed on August 1, 1936, at a price of 207.5 yuan. At that time, a certain party worked hard to go long and there was a period of rising. Later, due to good news about raw cotton and new cotton and sluggish yarn sales, the yarn inventory in the yarn and cloth warehouses increased sharply to more than 37,000 bales. The multiple parties had no intention of receiving goods, and the market price went from bad to worse. On September 2, it fell to a low of 196 yuan. Later, in the autumn, China's agricultural products were abundant, the purchasing power of villagers was strong, and the trade of cloth improved. The autumn sales developed, and the 30,000 bales of yarn in the yarn and cloth warehouse were sold out. Most of the yarn factories reduced production due to the shutdown of the machine repair in the summer, so the buying was more intense. The prosperity of the sales market was a new record in the five years since the leisure time. The market price rose sharply, and the highest peak was 256 yuan. Later, at the end of the year, the yarn sales were bleak, and the factory roots were loosened. A certain cotton company closed half of the large amount and opened the cash yarn to set out the target yarn, which fell to 245.4 yuan. Immediately after, the three-grade yarn was shorted and soared to 300 yuan. People's hearts were shaken, and there were many long-headed companies organized by Indian merchants, and then rebounded to more than 50 yuan. The final closing price was 253 yuan, which was 45.5 yuan higher than the opening price. The remaining to be delivered was 13,750 bales, which was 4,000 bales less than last month. The delivery price was calculated at the last three days and was 250 yuan, which was 13 yuan lower than last month. The delivered products included 10-count, 16-count, and 20-count yarns. There were a total of 5,600 bales of new goods, and the rest were self-delivered and received. The names and amounts of the brokers for the receiving and delivery parties are recorded separately as follows:</p>

<p>The target cotton for January was also launched on August 1, 1936, at a price of 41.1 yuan. At that time, in the era of old cotton, a certain visit organized a long-headed company and dragged in large quantities in July and August. The sound of squeezing air was sung into the clouds. The new cotton was pulled up by it, and on July 11, the peak reached 44 yuan. Then, on August 10, the China Cotton Industry Statistics Association announced that the estimated national cotton production reached more than 16 million dan, which was more than double the previous year. As a result, speculators flocked in and the market price plummeted, breaking the 40 yuan level. On September 2, it fell to 38 yuan. Later, due to the soaring yarn market, the cotton market, which was dependent on each other, was dragged into a good situation, and the highest peak reached 44 yuan again. The final closing price was 42.1 yuan, which was only 9 cents higher than the opening price. The remaining to be delivered was 41,500 dan, which was 22,800 dan less than last month. The delivery price was 42.5 yuan for the last two days, which was the same as last month. The delivered products included fire machine, Tonghua, Taicang, Hankou cotton, and Shashi cotton.

<p>Suspension of yarn and cloth market for delivery</p>
<p>The spot yarn and cotton are doing more than 35,000 pieces and packages.</p>
<p>The Yarn Standard Yarn Cotton Market suspended the meeting due to the delivery matters at the end of this month, but the current yarn merchants still went to the meeting to do business. Customers mostly ended their business due to the approaching period of the final accounts, and the business decreased. However, the price was firm due to the squeeze of the target yarn, and the hearts of the people were stable. The buyers from all gangs counted 567 packages, and the selling price rose by about 5 cents to 1 yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 107 Shantou 15 Inland 433 Ningbo 7 Wuhu 5 Total 567</p>
<p>The cotton market is stable. Because the overseas cotton industry is turning to high flying, and the flood in the United States is serious, and the cotton field area is suffering from the disease is expanding, people's hearts are shaken. Indian cotton has also rebounded. As for the development of the current sales factory stomach, Yufeng factory has exclusively done more than 2,000 pieces, with a source of 1,280 packages of Yaohua and 1,398 packages of Tonghua.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 62.75 Yufeng Factory entered 267 pieces of spot goods sent to the factory Cizhou Cotton 5715 and another 1,000 pieces and another Talisi 57.25 and another 1,000 pieces and another Zhengzhou Chemical 66.25 and another 300 pieces and another Laohekou 45.25 and another 655 pieces and another</p>
<p>The flood continues and American cotton people's hearts tend to buy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the market was active and firm. The price was due to good news from Liverpool, the flood continued, and the pledged cotton would not be sold off in large quantities. Fellow brokers and foreign merchants actively bought in, and the prices of each month rose by 2 to 9 pounds. People's hearts tended to buy, and the trend in the market was extremely firm. Although the rise in market prices caused a large number of long positions to close and hedge sales, they were all absorbed by buyers. Spot goods were firm and expensive, and there were not many sellers. People in the industry are waiting for the progress of the flood. According to Meng Feisi's report, the situation in the area has eased, but the insurance company is still working hard to transport cotton to higher ground. Later, the long positions closed, and part of them reacted. At the close, the industry bought in the near month, and the market was firm. It is estimated that spot goods rose by 8 pounds, and futures rose from no change to 8 pounds. British cotton rose by 15 points, and futures rose by 10 to 11 points. Indian cotton rose initially due to the American flood and exporters buying in, and then returned due to long positions taking profits, but then became firm again due to powerful Liverpool telecommunications. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 4.25 to 5 robes, Omra rose by 3 to 3.25 robes, and Bailuoxi rose by 2.75 to 3 robes. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 28th):</p>

<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening forecast on the 29th was 228.5 robes for Bailuoxi, 208.5 robes for Omra, and 183 robes for Pingguoer, all down by half a robe.</p>

<p>Suspension of the three-grade market and rise in spot yarn.</p>
<p>On the 29th, Osaka telegram, the three-grade futures market was suspended, and the spot yarn rose by 4 to 10 yuan. 16-count fan surface was 250 yuan, up 5 yuan. 20-count goldfish was 169 yuan, up 4 yuan. 40-count five-star was 410 yuan, up 10 yuan. 42-count pheasant was 400 yuan, up 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Flour and wheat fall step by step.</p>
<p>The price of foreign wheat continues to fall. Domestic actual sales have also decreased sharply.</p>
<p>At the opening of the flour market, the price of flour in each month showed a gradual and miserable decline. Because the price of foreign wheat was still not good, such as Chicago falling by 12 cents, Canada falling by nearly 5 cents, far falling by 42 cents, and Liverpool falling by 12 pence. Therefore, people's hearts were already soft when the price was opened, and some of the long positions could no longer be abandoned, resulting in a drop of 23 cents when the price was opened. Later, it was reported that the factory had continued to order 3,000 to 4,000 tons of foreign wheat the day before yesterday, at a price of 8 yuan and 7 corners. Therefore, people's hearts were even more empty, and the price was strong. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the price of February was initially opened from small to 8 corners and 7 cents. Then, the long positions outside the industry were unwilling to give up the idea of speculation, and wanted to hold on to it, so the trading turned weak, and the market was also in a stable situation. The external environment has also changed, such as the inability of domestic consumption to be smooth, and the future seems difficult to hold on.</p>
<p>Highest Lowest Yesterday Closing Day Comparison February 3.9125 3.8700 3.8950 down 0.0423 March 3.9800 3.9375 3.9450 0.0525 April 3.9800 3.9625 4.9850 0.0525</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market, the prices of each month fell sharply. Because the price of foreign wheat continued to fall, and in terms of the trend, those who hoarded last year were seeking to sell due to the improvement of the international situation. As far as the domestic situation is concerned, after the market reached its peak, actual sales decreased sharply. The so-called extreme things turn against each other, and it happened to be the right time. Therefore, the opening price saw a big drop, a drop of 68 cents to 11 cents. Until the opening of the market in the afternoon, the situation in February was even more lax. The opening price in March and April fell by 35 cents compared to the morning. Then, the flour market returned to stability, and there were also floating empty positions to make up for it, which was 37 cents higher than the initial opening. Looking at the overall situation, if foreign wheat continues to be determined, I am afraid that this year's situation will be in inverse proportion to last year. Because the settlement is approaching, the merchants lack goods, so there is no official delivery.</p>

<h3>He Xia Rice Market South Rise North Fall</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang was about 40 lots (8,600 to 700 stones of goods in total). The sales market of thin rice Nos. 11 and 12 in this street was turning weak, but the buns were still moving. It is estimated that the Tianjin and Qingdao gangs handled nearly 2,000 packages of thin rice, so the market for thin rice continued to rise by one corner or so. The thick japonica was stable, the sheep-tipped was slightly tight, the Du-tipped was short of goods, and the price was increased by a corner or so. The Yinbian Yuan had no rise or fall.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of the He Xia gangs was slightly strong, about 40 lots. The sales of each cargo on the market were very light. White japonica returned slightly by about one corner, early rice followed slightly by 78 cents, thin rice was slightly nearly one corner, Yangdu Port tipped price was slightly 25 cents, the guest-tipped was flat and tired, and the Baiyuan was a small number of points. The remaining goods were all in a soft trend.</p>
<p>Guest Xian Cantonese sales are still smooth.</p>
<p>Vendors and hoarders are eager to sell, and market prices are difficult to rebound.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Cantonese gang's handling of stomachs was active again. The city handled more than 4,000 packages of machine-hulled rice, but the sales in this street were weak again, and the oil building still had social events, so the market showed a tired surface and recovered. However, in recent days, the arrivals have been endless, with 7,000 to 8,000 packages to more than 10,000 packages every day. Peddlers and guest hoarders all plan to sell with the market, so the market price is ultimately difficult to rebound. More than 8,600 packages were opened throughout the day, asking for 6,235 packages of Jiangxi rice, 1,500 packages of Hanzzao, 540 packages of Wentaiyong rice, and 350 packages of Xiangnan rice. In the later market, with the end of the year approaching, there will be no major rise or fall. However, the demand for rice in Guangdong Province is very urgent, and the purchase is also poor, but due to insufficient ship positions, it has not been able to be fully enjoyed.</p>

The total number of transactions was extremely small, with thirty-five transactions in the morning and fourteen in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants Bought Japanese Exchange and Sold US Dollars</h3>
<p>The exchange market turned looser yesterday, but market conditions remained stable. Chinese observers initially based their actions on overseas telegrams, with London large accounts rising by 0.0625 for both near and far terms. The New York silver market remained unchanged, the Mont de Piété forward silver price remained unchanged or rose by 20 cents. London spot gold remained unchanged.

The morning opening of the exchange market showed no change in the selling price of recent terms. After the opening, spot transactions within this week hardened by 0.03125. Banks were willing to release, and the market loosened slightly. HSBC's official exchange rate announcement showed both the British pound and US dollar remaining stable. Although the silver balance tax rose by half a cent, it had little impact. Jewish merchants came to take in East Asian exchange. Japanese banks took advantage of the high prices to supply the market, and the market was still strong. Then banks did business with each other. The process for future terms was sluggish. Later, Chinese merchants bought a small amount of Japanese exchange and slightly sold US dollars. Banks also did a lot of trading with each other. The market fluctuated. The closing selling price for spot British exchange was 1 shilling, 2 pence, and 0.0625, and the US dollar was 29.84375 yuan, which was 0.03125 looser for both the British pound and US dollar compared to the previous closing. The same was true for future terms. Chinese merchants slightly bought Japanese exchange, as did Jewish merchants. Today's transaction record is as follows:</p>
<p>The morning opening selling price for near-term British exchange was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.059375 or 0.0625. There was a sale to Mai Jia Li for half a penny for June. Hua Qiao sold to Da Ying for 0.0625 for February 10. Hua Qiao sold to Zhejiang for the same price for February. In the afternoon market, Da Ying sold to Shanghai for half a penny for June. HSBC settled at 0.0625 for January. The closing selling price for spot was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 0.0625, 0.059375 for February, 0.05625 for March, and 0.053125 for April. The buying price was increased by 0.03125. The transaction volume was approximately 30,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The morning opening selling price for near-term US dollar exchange was 29.8125 or 29.875 yuan. There was a sale to Mai Jia Li for half a yuan for July. San Jing sold to Hua Yi for 0.075 for March. Hua Bi settled at half a yuan for July. The afternoon closing selling price for the near term was 29.875 yuan. In the afternoon market, there was a sale to Hua Qi for half a yuan for July. Mai Jia Li bought at 0.0875 for January. Hua Qiao sold to Hua Qi for 0.0875 for the first week of February. The closing selling price for spot was 29.84375 yuan, 29.78125 for February, 29.71875 for March, and 29.65625 for April. The buying price was increased by 0.0625. The transaction volume was approximately 200,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dong Hui was bought by San Jing at 105 yuan for the Dalian January term. Zhu You and Chao Xian sold to Qiao Zhi Fu at 104.625 yuan for the March term in Japanese exchange. Chao Xian settled at 104.875 yuan for the spot. The transaction volume was approximately 300,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Foreign Firms' Silk Market Still Difficult to Recover</p>
<p>For more than ten days, the domestic and foreign silk markets have been declining. As of yesterday, New York finally rebounded. The exchange traded 4,410 bales, and the silk price for both spot and futures increased by 2.5 to 3.5 cents. The Yokohama silk market was also firm yesterday, with the spot price rising by 13 yuan and the futures price rising by 12 yuan. The market sentiment seemed to stabilize. The Lyon silk market, the Shanghai silk market, and Guangdong silk all remained at the original price, while Japanese silk fell slightly by 0.25 francs. The local silk market for foreign firms was still difficult to recover. If the prices of Japanese and American silk could rise considerably again, the bid and ask prices for both sides could gradually converge. Yesterday, only users made sporadic purchases of white filature silk. Foreign firms' silk was still less active than Indian firms. A total of 38 bales were traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Over a Thousand Bags of Newly Arrived Sliced Raw Sugar Expected to be Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was still soft. The guild's pricing for 24 raw sugar white spot goods was slightly better the day before, but weakened again yesterday, quoted at 23 yuan. The re-export price was 0.05 less, at 7.55 yuan. Dong Bai also fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Spot No. 4 was 23.1 yuan, and the re-export price was 8 yuan, both down by 0.15 yuan. Spot No. 8 was 22.6 yuan, down by 0.2 yuan, and the re-export price was 7.7 yuan, down by 0.15 yuan. No. 5 YRO mark was 22.35 yuan, and the re-export price was 7.4 yuan, both down by 0.1 yuan. The local factory's refined white Zhenji No. 1 was 22.1 yuan, and Jin Xin Da Hua No. 1 was 22.2 yuan, with no changes in the prices. It was heard that the sliced raw sugar newly arrived by the Qing Yuan ship from Guangdong and Hong Kong yesterday had not yet been released. It was secretly expected that several thousand bags would be traded at a cheaper price. However, according to the Shantou telegram, due to the lack of Chaoqing arrivals and inventory, the production price was tight, and brown sugar also rose slightly. The Jianbang's previous inventory of raw raw sugar was still being hoarded.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Orchid Seeds Still Insufficient Supply</p>
<p>The orchid seeds continued to arrive slightly yesterday. Because only a small number of shipments arrived on successive ships, the supply was insufficient, especially for high-quality goods. Therefore, the market situation was still tight. The goods that arrived yesterday could probably be sampled today. If the goods are yellow and bright, the price could be further increased.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>100-Pound American Double-Strand Iron Extremely Quiet, Thinking of Action</p>
<p>Recently, oil companies, printing factories, and egg factories have been competing to purchase 100-pound American double-strand iron. Therefore, the market situation has suddenly become lively, and the selling price has been rising steadily. Currently, the top-grade goods on the market are sold at 50 yuan per box, the second-grade goods are 48 yuan, and the third-grade goods are 47.5 yuan. It was found that more than 400 boxes were sold yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ribbed Steel Bar Prices High, Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>Since the overseas price of ribbed steel bars has soared, the local market price has also risen sharply. The standard price has gradually increased from 120 yuan to 180 yuan. Recently, the overseas price has been quoted at £9 19s, an increase of more than £4 10s compared to before. Therefore, the Shanghai market sentiment is surprisingly strong. However, due to the approaching of the Lunar New Year and the excessive price increases by industry colleagues, buyers are watching and hesitating. Therefore, the market transaction has stagnated. Only factories have sporadic transactions, with only slight releases. It was found that the price the day before yesterday was between 175 yuan and 180 yuan, with an estimated 40 to 50 tons sold by hardware stores along North Suzhou Road.</p>

<h3>Special Cash Guarantee System and the Spirit of the Times</h3>
<p>— Pan Wen'an Jin Muyao</p>
<p>The establishment of banks in our country began in the late Qing Dynasty. In the past thirty years, although the leaders and administrative authorities have been determined to improve and expand them, they have been constrained by the environment, natural disasters, and man-made disasters, which have prevented them from achieving peace. As a result, even today, there are still many things that need to be improved, which cannot be denied. For example, business policies and investment channels all have shortcomings that can be criticized. This is a major issue, so let's set it aside for now. As for the personnel guarantee system, it is a problem that bank authorities and employees alike find difficult to handle. As the saying goes, "When things reach an extreme, they change; change leads to progress." This is certainly not an empty phrase. In recent years, proposals for reforming the personnel guarantee system, such as "credit guarantee" and "special cash guarantee methods," have emerged frequently, and the latter is particularly novel and adapted to the trends of the times. This system was planned by Mr. Tang Shoumin, the general manager of the Bank of Communications, and Mr. Wang Weiyin, the secretary and personnel section chief of the bank. It has been repeatedly discussed and studied by the Shanghai Banking Association and the Banking Society, and it is considered to be feasible. Recently, it has been widely criticized in order to achieve perfection (the original text was published in the Shen Bao on January 27). In the midst of the clamor for reforming the guarantee system, this is a problem with great research value. Therefore, I would like to express my humble opinions to correct the current sages:</p>
<p>The basic spirit of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" lies in the joint and several responsibility between the bank and its employees. The general plan is to use the deposit of three types of guarantee deposits, A, B, and C, as material guarantees, and to use the strict imposition of joint and several responsibility as a spiritual guarantee. The method is as follows: ㊀ When an employee joins, they shall pay a "Type A guarantee deposit" equal to three times their monthly salary, which shall be stored by the bank and paid interest at a weekly rate of 1.2%. When resigning, if the employee has not committed any fraud or has not been jointly punished due to the fraud of a colleague, the entire principal and half of the interest shall be returned; the remaining half of the interest shall be allocated by the bank to the "Employee Guarantee Reserve." ㊁ Employees shall pay a "Type B guarantee deposit" equal to 2% of their monthly salary, which shall be stored by the bank and paid interest at a weekly rate of 1.2%. When resigning, if the employee has not committed any fraud or embezzlement, they shall be reimbursed after deducting the amount of proportional compensation due to the fraud of a colleague. ㊂ Each year, the bank shall allocate several tens of thousands of yuan for a "Type C guarantee deposit," which shall be stored in a special account and paid interest at a weekly rate of 1.2%. The bank shall also establish an "Employee Guarantee Deposit Account," and at the end of each year, it shall deposit ㊀ half of the interest from the Type A guarantee deposit, ㊁ the principal and interest from the Type B guarantee deposit, and ㊂ the principal and interest from the Type C guarantee deposit into the account to serve as a "Guarantee Reserve." In the event of an employee committing fraud or embezzlement, in addition to confiscating their Type A guarantee deposit and half of the interest and sealing up their property in accordance with the law, the reserve can be used to make up for the loss. The accumulation of small amounts can add up to a large sum, which must be sufficient for use. At the same time, it is strictly stipulated that employees who are jointly or severally responsible for handling the job with the employee who committed the fraud in the same branch, and the direct supervisors of the same branch, shall be subject to joint and several punishment. This is the general outline of the system.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, with the high development of industry, the division of labor has become more detailed, transactions have become more frequent, and the degree of mutual dependence among members of society has deepened. A person who produces a certain commodity or a certain part of a commodity must cooperate with those who produce other commodities or other parts of a commodity, and exchange or coordinate with each other in order to obtain the necessities of life, or to make the whole commodity generate value. As a result, members of society must divide and cooperate in all aspects of life activities, and everyone makes individual contributions to promote the entire social organization. The evolution of this production system will inevitably affect the social ideology. Therefore, the laissez-faire policy and individualism that were popular in the 19th century, whose purpose was to remove the shackles of feudal forces in the Middle Ages in order to promote industrial productivity, can no longer represent the current social trend of interconnected relationships. As a result, Western celebrities such as Diguit, Laski, and Spann came out to create the theories of "Social Solidarity" and "Collectivism" (or "Totalitarianism"), clarifying the theory that the molecules of society must be mutually responsible and closely cooperate. All activities must be based on the premise of taking care of the interests of the whole society. All those who cooperate with others to promote the welfare of the masses are good; those who act on their own and disregard the masses are evil. If A has a fault, the entire society must be responsible; if B makes a contribution, it is the result of cooperation of the entire society. Therefore, our obedience to the laws and regulations of the government is not subject to the threats of divine or royal power, but because we recognize that these laws and regulations help the cooperation of society and conform to the principles of interconnected relationships. Therefore, we must obey them to form a close-knit organization. This spirit can be seen everywhere in modern progressive society. The most popular in our country are cooperatives and the Baojia system, etc., and the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is also one of the systems that adapt to this spirit of the times.</p>
<p>Although the forms of cooperatives can be distinguished into production cooperatives, marketing cooperatives, consumer cooperatives, and lending cooperatives, etc., their basic principles are inseparable from the direct activities of each member to achieve the same goal. The successes and failures are shared by each member, and not manipulated by a third party. This principle is most obvious in lending cooperatives; members borrow money and are jointly and severally guaranteed by all members. The power of the whole is used to promote the soundness of individual members. Therefore, the actions of one member must be supervised by all members; otherwise, other members will have to bear the consequences and be jointly liable for compensation. The same is true for the Baojia system. The residents of one Bao and one Jia mutually guarantee that they will not do anything wrong. If something improper happens, the residents of the same Bao and same Jia, except for those that are truly difficult to discover in advance, shall be subject to joint and several punishment. Therefore, they must be closely supervised and carefully prevented from the slightest hint of impropriety at ordinary times, and any impropriety must be reported. If implemented properly, it can indeed make the neighborhood peaceful and the community quiet. The above two points have been designated by the National Government as important policies for reviving the rural economy and preparing for local autonomy. The essence of it is to adopt the principles of joint and several liability.</p>
<p>The reason why the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is superior to the guarantor system and credit insurance is that it adopts the spirit of joint and several liability and adapts to the trend of the times. At the beginning of an employee's employment, they must pay a "Type A guarantee deposit" equal to three times their monthly salary; and then they must deduct a "Type B guarantee deposit" equal to 2% of their monthly salary. If someone in the same office commits fraud or embezzles public funds, the half of the interest on the "Type A guarantee deposit" and the full amount of the principal and interest on the "Type B guarantee deposit" of all employees may be withdrawn to make up for the loss. This method of joint and several compensation is sufficient to arouse mutual concern among colleagues and generate a sense of shared destiny, one. After a fraud occurs, the employees who jointly or severally handle the job in the same branch as the employee who committed the fraud, and the direct supervisors of the same branch, shall be subject to joint and several punishment; this is sufficient to urge the employees who handle affairs together to carefully review and thoroughly examine the matters handled by others, two.</p>
<p>The old-fashioned guarantor system has many defects, which need not be repeated. And allowing employees to find their own guarantors, without linking them together, and the guarantors have little opportunity to supervise the behavior of the guaranteed employees, this old method with a strong individualistic color cannot adapt to a society with a detailed division of labor and frequent cooperation. In the future, it will inevitably be replaced by a new system of joint and several liability, without any doubt. Because the author believes that the abandonment of the old system cannot be delayed, and the reason why the new system must be adopted by society is that it has a foundation in the spirit of the times; therefore, I am happy to express it.

<h3>Philippine President Quezon Went to the United States Yesterday</h3>
<p>The National Government specially presented the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade; Quezon thanked and congratulated China and the Philippines for their close ties</p>
<p>Philippine President Quezon arrived in Shanghai on the 28th at noon by the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Canada ship and was warmly welcomed by our side. Quezon was eager to go to the United States, so he left Shanghai by the original ship at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. In order to promote the relationship between China and the Philippines, our National Government specially sent Mayor Wu as a representative to present the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade on the afternoon of the 28th. The details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>The National Government presented a noble medal; in order to promote the relationship between China and the Philippines, the National Government specially sent Mayor Wu Tiecheng as a representative to present Quezon with the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade, which is the highest noble medal that our country presents to foreign heads of state. The presentation ceremony was held at Mayor Wu's private residence on Haig Road at 5:00 PM on the 28th, after the grand tea party jointly held by Vice President Kong and Mayor Wu to welcome Quezon. Ambassadors, ministers, and consuls-general of various countries in Shanghai participated. Mayor Wu Tiecheng delivered a speech on behalf of the National Government, saying that he was presenting Philippine President Quezon with the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade on behalf of the National Government to express our country's very friendly intentions towards the Philippines and to wish the relationship between China and the Philippines increasingly close. After Mayor Wu finished his speech, he respectfully presented the medal to Quezon. After Quezon received the medal, he gave a reply, saying that he was very honored and grateful to receive the Grand Cordon Order of Brilliant Jade presented by the Chinese National Government, but in accordance with the Philippine Constitution, the President cannot accept a medal from another country before the Congress approves it. Therefore, he can only receive it today and cannot wear it, but he dares to believe that the Philippine Congress will definitely pass this matter when it convenes. As for the relationship between China and the Philippines, it has always been very close. The Philippines had already traded with China before it traded with other countries. Moreover, there are many Chinese people in the Philippines, and there is a clear and close relationship in commerce and finance. Therefore, we wish the relationship between China and the Philippines will become closer and closer.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, all walks of life in Shanghai saw him off; Quezon and his party landed at noon on the 28th. It was originally scheduled to return to the original ship at 11:00 PM that night. Due to busy socializing, they stayed overnight at the Hua Mao Hotel that night. They went to the Gonghexiang Wharf at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning to return to the original ship. Mayor Wu, Zhou Jue, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, and the US Consul-General in Shanghai Goss, etc., all went to the wharf to see them off. The ship set sail eastward at 9:30 AM.</p>
<p>Quezon's wife will pass through Shanghai next month; Quezon's wife originally planned to go to the United States with him, but the Catholic Congress is scheduled to be held in Manila on February 3rd, and Mrs. Quezon must represent Quezon to receive the Catholic friends. She did not have time to go with him, so she changed her plan to go to the United States by the Changxing Shipping Company's Empress of Japan from the Philippines on February 20th, and she is scheduled to pass through Shanghai on the 25th. After Mrs. Quezon arrives in the United States, she will accompany Quezon to England to attend the coronation ceremony of the new British monarch after Quezon finishes his official business in the United States.</p>

<h3>Achievements in Salt Administration Rectification in the 25th Year</h3>
<p>Tax Revenue Exceeds 200 Million, a Fourfold Increase Compared to the 17th Year of the Republic; Progress Seen in Construction Projects and Improvement Efforts</p>
<p>The progress and effectiveness of our country's salt administration work last year have been of great concern to the public. It is learned that the preliminary annual report of the Salt Revenue Audit Office for the 25th year has been completed. Therefore, we urgently explored and recorded it as follows:</p>
<p>Total Salt Tax Revenue According to the preliminary statistical reports from various regions, the total salt tax revenue for this year has exceeded 200 million yuan. In the 17th year of the Republic, before this office was restored, the salt tax revenue was only 54 million yuan, less than a decade ago, it has increased more than fourfold. (In the past eight years, tax revenues have been increasing steadily: 61,071,000 yuan in the 18th year, 104,581,000 yuan in the 19th year, 134,228,000 yuan in the 20th year, 142,185,000 yuan in the 21st year, 159,247,000 yuan in the 22nd year, 177,461,000 yuan in the 23rd year, 185,446,000 yuan in the 24th year, and 205,433,000 yuan in the 25th year.) The sharp increase in tax revenue last year was mainly due to the good harvests and the relatively stable situation, but the rectification of the salt administration itself was the main reason. Important reform measures last year included the acceleration of construction of salt field projects, the strict rectification of anti-smuggling efforts, the abolition of contractors, the consolidation of tax rates, the continued improvement of the salt administration organization, and the thorough elimination of malpractices by officials and merchants, all of which directly and indirectly contributed to increased tax revenue. As for the implementation of the new measurement system, although the salt tax has been raised invisibly (but there have also been reductions in several places), the transportation and sales of salt are also greatly affected by the law of diminishing returns in economics. The higher the tax rate, the more expensive the salt price. Most ordinary people are poor, and their purchasing power will inevitably be weaker. Furthermore, with the increase in tax rates, smuggling will inevitably become more rampant, which the original anti-smuggling equipment cannot cope with. In addition, unscrupulous merchants take the opportunity to manipulate and profit from the tax increase. Therefore, as soon as the salt tax rate is increased, official sales will temporarily decrease sharply. Historically, it has been reviewed that in the last seasons of dynasties, salt taxes were often increased, but as a result, tax revenues were greatly reduced. This is clear evidence. Since the implementation of the new measurement system in the 23rd year, the number of official salt sales has been slightly less, but because the salt administration organization is sound, the original tax revenue has not only not decreased due to excessive tax increases, but has also made considerable progress, which is rare and valuable. Moreover, in order to cope with the rise of high-tax barriers, anti-smuggling efforts have been greatly rectified. Therefore, the sales volume reduced due to the tax increase in recent years has gradually recovered. The important matters held in this year are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Merger of Agencies Since the Salt Revenue Audit Office took over the administrative affairs of the salt administration in the 21st year, the salt administration agencies in various regions have been successively merged over the years, saving a total of more than 4 million yuan in expenses each year. In May of this year, the position of Vice Commissioner of Huainan Transportation was abolished, and the Yangzhou Branch was changed to a sub-branch, and the Huaibei Branch was changed to the Lianghuai Branch to control the salt affairs of Lianghuai. In July, the position of Vice Commissioner of Northern Sichuan Transportation was abolished, and the Northern Sichuan Branch and the Chongqing Audit Office were changed to sub-branches. The original Southern Sichuan Branch was changed to the Sichuan Branch to control the salt affairs of Sichuan. In October, the position of Governor of Guangdong and Guangxi Transportation was changed to be concurrently held by the manager of the Guangdong and Guangxi Audit Office, saving more than 600,000 yuan in expenses each year. In addition, the salt fields in the Sichuan region were scattered and also merged in October of this year to facilitate centralized management. At present, except for Shanxi and Yunnan, the administrative and anti-smuggling affairs of salt affairs in various regions are all under the jurisdiction of the Audit Office. The responsibilities are complete, and the powers are consistent. Therefore, the salt administration has entered a new class, and there is an atmosphere of clarity and development. This organizational spirit is in line with the salt affairs agency organization passed by the Legislative Yuan in July of the 25th year.</p>
<p>New Construction in Salt Field Areas The construction of salt fields in the three regions of Changlu, Huaibei, and Guangdong, such as salt storage warehouses, tax police barracks, surrounding field roads, salt transportation rivers, and telephone networks, has been mostly completed. The newly produced salt is returned to the warehouse on time, and private salt taxes are reduced. This year, the construction of salt field projects in the regions of Min, Lu, Zhe, Huai, and Lu is still being actively carried out according to the previously determined plan. The total budget for the whole year's projects, excluding the three regions of Sichuan, Guangdong, and Hedong, reached 6,501,780 yuan. Last year, the Dongzhuang breach caused the Yellow River to flood south, and the Huaibei area became a swamp. In order to protect the salt fields and maintain the livelihood of the people, the Ministry of Finance approved an appropriation of more than 600,000 yuan to the Lianghuai Construction Committee, together with the National Economic Council and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, to dredge the Shanhou Cenchi Junzhou and Sanhe separately to drain the downstream to avoid flooding. The project, which is 46 kilometers long, was completed this year.</p>
<p>Gradual Balancing of Tax Rates The salt tax rates in various regions were previously vastly different, and were not uniform. In recent years, they have been reorganized and gradually balanced. This year, the tax rates in Sichuan and the four banks of the Yangtze River have been reorganized. The tax rates in the Sichuan region originally had more than ten kinds. They were revised in March and December to simplify them. The light tax near the fields of Liangzhe, the Zhejiang salt tax of Shangnanchuan, the Yue salt tax of Xiangnan, the shoulder-carrying river of Yuantan Sanhejian, the Huai salt tax of Yunhe, the Huai salt tax of Jiangxi Jianchang Zhuanan, and the Mengqing Shi salt tax of the Northwest region have also been reorganized to meet the main purpose of simplicity and uniformity.</p>
<p>Promoting the Free System The evils of the monopoly system in our country are rampant, and the Salt Law promulgated in the 20th year of the Republic also first raised the purpose of free trade. In recent years, the monopoly of salt sales in the four counties of Lintan Fei Yi in Shandong, and the exclusive sale of Yingan in Sichuan Furong, as well as eighteen counties including Yongjia in Liangzhe, eighteen counties including Shangyou Nanping in Fujian, thirty-one cities and counties including Shantou in Liangguang, and the original contractors in Gansu have been abolished one after another, allowing scattered merchants to freely report and transport. Nanjing has also been designated as a free sales area for Huainan Northern Field Salt and refined salt, beyond the sales area of Huainan food bank exclusive merchants. This year, seven counties including Minhou in Fujian, seven counties including Enping in Guangdong, and one county in Zhongshan were all changed to free trade to lead the way for the implementation of the new Salt Law.</p>
<p>Adjusting Production, Transportation, and Sales The salt needed in various regions is supplied by a fixed production area before the Yin'an system is abolished. However, this system needs to be adjusted at any time due to changes in production and sales conditions and other situations. For example, the western part of Guanzhong in Shaanxi Province has always been a Gansu salt sales area. In September of this year, due to the obstruction of transportation roads, Gansu salt was out of stock, and the people were in danger of eating tasteless food. It was approved to borrow Lu salt to meet the emergency needs. The same situation occurred in the Sichuan and Hunan regions in June of this year. Efforts were made to adjust them separately, and both the interests of the production area and the sales area were taken into consideration. In addition, in order to adjust production and sales, prevent salt shortages, and balance salt prices, Changping salt was continued to be operated in Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Zhejiang, Fujian and other provinces and cities. In addition, the establishment of warehouses for storing salt in various provinces and regions is being actively prepared.</p>
<p>Rectifying Anti-Smuggling Affairs The most important rectification of anti-smuggling affairs this year is the area of Sichuan, Guangdong, and Liangzhe. The anti-smuggling administration of Sichuan and Guangdong was extremely lax. Since the administrative affairs of each region were merged and managed by the Audit Office, the anti-smuggling police force was completely reorganized at the same time, and capable police officers from other regions were transferred to carry out practical rectification. The salt fields in Liangzhe are scattered and easy to smuggle. Before the completion of the salt field encirclement project, a special inspection police force was added to be stationed in each important field to check the salt production work and quantity, and strictly prevent private leaks.</p>
<p>Eliminating Nitrate Salt The production of nitrate salt is most prevalent in Hebei and Henan provinces, followed by Shandong Province. There are also four counties in Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province. The quality is poor and the price is cheap, and private sales are extremely rampant. A committee for improving alkaline land was established in Hebei Province to implement a plan to improve the soil, using various methods such as digging wells, opening canals, releasing silt, turning the soil, deep plowing, ridge cultivation, and fertilization, and providing loans for planting and promoting the planting of American cotton. It is estimated that the amount of loans issued this year is about 55,000 yuan, and the amount of seeds issued is about 182,000 catties. The production of private nitrate salt has gradually decreased. The salt tax revenue this year has increased by about 4 million yuan compared with the 23rd year. Henan Province has also established a committee for organizing waterways and improving the soil, opening and closing rivers and canals, and revitalizing water conservancy. The rivers and canals dredged this year are 536 kilometers long. The counties in Jiangsu and Shandong provinces that produce local salt are also imitating the methods of improving the soil.</p>
<p>Managing Gypsum Salt Gypsum salt is a by-product of gypsum salt. Yingcheng County in Hubei Province is the most abundant, and Xiangtan County in Hunan Province also has it. In the past, only the local government levied business tax, and the production, transportation, and sales were not managed by the salt affairs agency in accordance with the law, resulting in the impact of the salt everywhere and harming the national tax. The Ministry of Finance suggested that the internal salt affairs agency take over the management. It sent personnel to Hubei to negotiate with the Hubei Provincial Government and took over in June of this year. The Yingcheng Gypsum Salt Administration was established to implement management. The gypsum salt in Hunan Province was also transferred by the Hunan Provincial Government to the Xiang'an Audit Office for takeover, and management methods were stipulated.</p>
<p>Foreign Debt Has Been Repaid All foreign debts guaranteed by salt tax were repaid on schedule this year in accordance with the methods set by the Ministry of Finance. The principal and interest of the debts repaid are listed below: ㊀ Huguang Railway Syndicate Loan: £141,450, 7 shillings and 1 pence, equivalent to 2,291,597.27 yuan in national currency, and £65, 10 shillings, equivalent to 1,040.13 yuan in national currency. ㊁ Crisp Syndicate Loan: £128,768, 14 shillings and 5 pence, equivalent to 3,401,119.42 yuan in national currency, and £212,555, 7 shillings and 11 pence, equivalent to 3,642,300.03 yuan in national currency. ㊂ British-French Syndicate Loan: £16,929, 17 shillings and 9 pence, equivalent to 268,869.33 yuan in national currency, and £267,743, 3 pence, equivalent to 4,422,282.96 yuan in national currency. ㊃ Marconi Company Syndicate Loan: £18,069, 1 shilling and 2 pence, equivalent to 300,541.30 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Preparing for the New Salt Law The main point of the new Salt Law is to levy taxes at the salt fields and allow people to buy and sell freely. Since its promulgation, although the implementation date has not been approved, this office should organize salt affairs in accordance with the established standards and actively prepare for implementation. However, the implementation of the new law must maintain the original tax revenue on the one hand, so that the national financial resources and the national treasury income will not be affected by the difficult meeting. On the other hand, under the current situation of rural bankruptcy and industrial and commercial depression, the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of salt people who will be eliminated as a result of free competition must also be taken into consideration for salt fields with higher costs. The monopoly system has been implemented for hundreds of years, and it has mutual relationships in national finance and social finance. Therefore, epoch-making reforms should be carefully planned to promote the greatest benefit. The steps for implementing the new law in this office over the years have depended on the promotion of national politics and finance. After careful consideration, it was decided to start with managing field production, improving salt quality, balancing tax rates, abolishing contractors, and organizing anti-smuggling and improving the functions of the salt administration organization. This office believes that the above-mentioned points have been actively carried out. After the completion of the work, the new Salt Law will be completed, and all of it will be promoted. This year, all regions have worked hard to promote the policies of this office, and its effectiveness is commendable.</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Comparison Table The salt tax revenue collected by each region this year is listed in the following table for comparison: Head Office: 677,000; Changlu: 27,674,000; Hedong: 4,620,000; Northern Jin: 1,320,000; Shaanxi: 1,792,000; Northern Sichuan: 1,741,000; Shandong: 11,302,000; Lianghuai: 41,420,000; Songjiang: 13,308,000; Liangzhe: 11,453,000; E'an: 15,027,000; Xiang'an: 15,257,000; Wan'an: 6,033,000; Xi'an: 7,277,000; Henan: 8,045,000; Yingcheng: 2000; Fujian: 4,329,000; Liangguang: 11,391,000; Yunnan: 1,651,000; Sichuan: 2,205,000; Total: 205,433,000 yuan. Explanation: ㊀ In addition to the salt tax, there are highway donations in Xi'an, river engineering donations in Changlu, operating expenses in Fujian, local surcharges in Guangdong and Yunnan, and organization fees in various regions. These are not included in the table, and are estimated to be about 8 million yuan per year. If all the numbers are listed together, the salt tax this year will increase by nearly 30 million yuan compared with last year. ㊁ The numbers listed in the table are based on the preliminary statistics of each region. After the accounts are audited, they will be corrected in the formal annual report.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Local Bank Launched Industrial and Commercial Loans</h3>
<p>A Trial Run Will Be Conducted in the Head Office Starting on February 1st; A Decision Will Be Made to Gradually Promote It After Achieving Results</p>
<p>Xin Sheng She reported that in order to support industry and commerce, the Zhejiang Local Bank has launched industrial and commercial loans, which will be started on February 1st. A trial run will be conducted in the head office first, and a decision will be made to gradually promote it after achieving results. The loans will be temporarily limited to seven industries, including electrical machinery silk weaving, silk weaving, machinery iron industry, silk industry, cloth industry, rice industry, and north-south goods industry. The loan regulations and introduction methods are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Loan Regulations</p>
<p>㊀ In order to assist small and medium-sized industrial and commercial enterprises in their operating funds and provide them with the opportunity to raise funds, the Bank will handle small-amount industrial and commercial loans. Small and medium-sized industrial and commercial factories and shops that have been established for more than two years and have joined the same industry association may apply for loans. ㊁ The loan amount for each household is limited to 200 to 1,000 yuan in national currency and is limited to use as industrial and commercial working capital. ㊂ Industrial and commercial factories and shops must be introduced by the same industry association, come to the Bank for face-to-face negotiation, and after being approved, an application form will be issued. The borrower must fill in the form truthfully and submit it to the Bank for review. If it is deemed qualified, the applicant factory or shop will be notified to come to the Bank to sign a loan agreement. ㊃ This loan must be guaranteed by two reputable factories or individuals approved by the Bank, and movable property may be used as collateral. Before the loan is repaid, if the Bank believes that the guarantor needs to be replaced, the borrower shall immediately find a new guarantor. ㊄ Each factory or shop may only borrow once at the same time, and the guarantor may only guarantee once and may not guarantee again or guarantee each other. ㊅ The term of this loan shall not exceed six months. The loan interest is divided into three types: lump-sum repayment upon maturity and installment repayment. If the principal and interest are not repaid upon maturity, the guarantor will be notified to repay immediately after the Bank's limited-term demand is ineffective (or the collateral will be disposed of, and if there is insufficient, the guarantor will still be fully responsible for repayment), and the right to protest and prior recourse will be waived. ㊆ The interest rate for this loan will be determined according to the local financial market conditions. ㊇ The actual operating situation of the industrial and commercial factories and shops that borrow money must be reported to the Bank in accordance with the prescribed date. ㊈ The Bank may send personnel to inspect the business situation and loan usage of the industrial and commercial factories and shops that borrow money at any time. If it is deemed unsafe or found to be inconsistent with the items filled in the application form, the Bank may recover all the loans from the guarantor without waiting for the maturity date. ㊉ If there are any matters not covered in these regulations, they may be revised at any time.</p>
<p>Introduction Methods</p>
<p>㊀ If various industrial and commercial industries need the Bank to lend small amounts of loans, the same industry association of each industry must formally discuss with the Bank and obtain the Bank's consent before the loans can be started for each industry. ㊁ The same industry association of each industry that has been agreed by the Bank to lend small amounts of loans must organize a special committee or designate a responsible department to handle the introduction matters. ㊂ Before the same industry association introduces industrial and commercial factories and shops to borrow money from the Bank, it must conduct a preliminary review of the content, loan usage, and repayment ability of each factory or shop. If it is deemed inappropriate, it will not be introduced. ㊃ If the loan introduced by a certain association is not handled in accordance with the contract provisions, or the agreement is breached upon maturity and the repayment is delayed, the association may not introduce other factories or shops. ㊄ The association shall be responsible for the loan it introduces until it is repaid. If it cannot be repaid upon maturity, the association shall assist the Bank in demanding payment and petition the local government and court to take administrative and legal actions against the borrowing factory or shop. ㊅ If there are any matters not covered in these measures, they may be revised at any time.</p>
<h3>Hong Shen, Fu Donghua and Others Convene a Forum of Literary and Art Figures</h3>
<p>Initiate the Organization of the Chinese Literary and Art Association; Issue a Declaration on the Unified National Salvation Movement</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 29th), Hong Shen, Fu Donghua, Shao Xunmei, Gu Zhongyi, Hu Zhongchi, Ye Lingfeng, and six others invited literary and art writers from the city to hold a forum at the Jiu Lou of the Youth Association on Baxianqiao Road. Fu Yanchang, Jian Youwen, Wang Fuquan, Wang Tongzhao, Hu Huaichen, Shi Zhecun, Du Heng, Zhao Jiabi, Shen Qiping, Fan Zhongyun, Li Qingya, Gu Fengcheng, Yao Sufeng, Yedan, Ma Zihua, Zhou Renlin, Tao Kangde, Lu Shaofei, Liang Desuo, Lin Huiyin, Zhou Yuying, Xu Chi, Zhou Leshan, Zhang Menglin, Dai Wangshu, Wang Dingjiu, Ma Guoliang, Pan Zienong, Qian Taisheng, Gu Cangheng, Ni Yide, Zhu Manhua, Zhao Jingshen, Zhou Duo, Zhang Zhengfan, Huang Jingqi, Liu Xiangou, Yang Jinhao, Ji Xizong, Xu Beichen, Huang Xianggu, Zhang Daren, Wang Qixu, Tang Zengyang, Xu Suling, Chen Dongbai, and more than eighty others attended. Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, and Hong Ruizhao were also invited to attend. First, Shao Xunmei reported on the significance of convening the forum, briefly stating that literature and art have an extremely important relationship with society and greatly affect the rise and fall of the nation. Therefore, today's forum is convened to discuss the following matters: 1. To initiate the organization of the Chinese Literary and Art Association to seek the great unity of all literary and art workers; 2. How to protect the interests of literary and art writers; 3. How literary and art writers, in this time of national crisis, should clearly identify their goals and work together. A draft of the "Declaration of the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles on the Unified National Salvation Movement" is submitted for your opinions. Next, Chuan Donghua added his views, briefly stating that according to the statistics of the publishing industry in 1936, the sales of literary and art books are declining. Therefore, we must first find ways to start a new literary renaissance movement. In the past, there have been several organizational bodies in the literary and art circles, but they were divided by factions, and unity was just empty talk. Therefore, we should seek a true unity movement. The necessary condition for a literary renaissance is social stability. The way to social stability is none other than unity. Today, the situation of unity has been roughly completed. We should cherish and consolidate it. Hong Shen briefly said that I once made an oath that if China launches a war of resistance against the enemy one day, if I personally do not sacrifice on the battlefield, then my personal words and deeds in this life will be false and deceitful. I believe that Chinese literary and art writers should seek unity with sincerity and jointly save this critically endangered country. Sacrificing the small self for the struggle of the nation and the country is the beginning of a revolutionary literary and art writer. I personally absolutely support the National Government and Chairman Chiang, who are fighting for peaceful unification and resisting foreign aggression to save the country today. In the process of national salvation, literary and art writers should completely abandon private grievances and unite to engage in the anti-Japanese national salvation movement. Jian Youwen briefly stated that, standing in the position of a writer, I fully agree with the "Declaration of the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles on the Unified National Salvation Movement" and have no objection. I especially agree with the organization of the Literary and Art Writers Association. In the past, the reason why writers could not unite was, first, the individualism of each writer; second, the egoism of each small group. To seek unity, we should change the habit of mutual contempt among scholars into mutual respect. Fan Zhongyun briefly said that Chinese scholars, since individualism has expanded and it is difficult to unite, have also been invaded by the ideology of imperial kingship, divided into various barriers, which is unfortunate. The greatness of our country's culture can be proved in history, not only unifying China, but also unifying various countries in the East. After the contact between China and the West, the differences in the ideological world are rare in the history of our country. For example, I was attacked by people a few years ago as a follower of nationalism, thinking that patriotism is ideological backwardness, but today everyone advocates patriotism, that is, the so-called leftists also advocate national defense literature. In a backward nation, ideological unity is indeed important. With the backwardness of our country's industry today, the promotion of the national cultural movement is even more urgent. Pan Zinong briefly said that I think two points should be added to the "Declaration of the Literary and Art Circles on the Unified National Salvation Movement": one is to resist aggression, and the other is to eliminate traitors. Wang Fuquan briefly stated that I have participated in the unity movement of the literary and art circles twice. The first time was before the September 18th Incident, and the second time was during the January 28th battle. The first participants disappeared after the meeting. The second participants, although they met several times, still had no results. The reason is that individualism is too strong. I think that only by overcoming individualism as much as possible, under the slogan of unified national salvation, can we seek true unity. Ma Zihua briefly said that under the anti-Japanese national salvation, no one can oppose the organization of literary and art groups. Then Xu Beichen and others expressed many opinions. The conveners asked Fang Xikong and Pan Gongzhan to express their opinions. Finally, the proposal was discussed: ㊀ The issue of revising the declaration, please Shao Xunmei, Hong Chen, Chuan Donghua, Ye Lingfeng, Hu Zhongchi, Gu Zhongyi, Fan Zhongyun, and seven others, revise it in accordance with the revision principles in the forum, and issue it in the name of all the participants. ㊁ The issue of organizing the Chinese Literary and Art Association, all the attendees are the initiators of the association, and Shao Xunmei, Hong Chen, Chuan Donghua, Li Qingya, Hu Zhongchi, Jian Youwen, Fan Zhongyun, Ye Lingfeng, Gu Zhongyi, Zhao Jingshen, Shen Qiyu, Wang Tongzhao, Yao Sufeng, Wang Fuquan, Zhou Hanmei, and fifteen others are appointed as preparatory committee members. The "Declaration of the Shanghai Literary and Art Circles on the Unified National Salvation Movement" is recorded as follows: We believe that literary and art works are the product of personal emotions, but individuals cannot exist independently of society, and emotions are determined by their surrounding environment. Therefore, to be honest, literary and art works cannot escape the limitations of time and space. Therefore, an era has the literature and art of an era, and a nation has the literature and art of a nation, each with its own unmistakable characteristics. The reason why literary and art works become the reflection of the times and the expression of national character lies here. We also know that literary and art works are the product of emotions and are different from scientific works that appeal to people's intellect. Literary and art works cannot be separated from the qualities of emotion, so they can arouse the resonance of readers, making people happy, angry, and sad, indignant, and unable to control themselves. Therefore, literary and art works, although are the expression of personal emotions, have broad social and national characteristics and can universally penetrate into the masses. Only in this way, in order to adapt to the urgent needs of our entire nation today, we feel that the literary and art circles must have a deep understanding of the direction of future efforts. In recent years, although foreign troubles have deepened and internal worries have not ended, there is one point that we can clearly see, that is, today's China is indeed very different from before. In the second half of last year alone, we resolutely rejected the enemy's demands and resolutely repelled the enemy's invasion. The reason why there was such a turning point was due to the rough completion of national unification. Therefore, if we want to thoroughly achieve the goal of national liberation, we must deeply recognize the great significance of national unification. However, if we want to achieve truly consolidated unity from the roughly completed unity, we still need our efforts. In other words, we must use the collective power of the entire nation to overcome all obstacles to national liberation. The separation of feudal warlords and the entanglement of international forces are enough to affect the unified situation that we have roughly completed. We must eliminate them with cultural forces. In the past history, the political unity of China relied entirely on huge cultural forces to maintain it. However, since the invasion of imperialist forces, our cultural circles also seem to be divided into some kind of barriers, which is contrary to the needs of the times and the nation. It is a very regrettable thing. Therefore, at present, for the grasp of the meaning of our national unity and national liberation, people in our literary and art circles bear a greater responsibility. We must make this demand for national unity penetrate into the hearts of every citizen, like the raging tide of the river and sea, surging and becoming a central driving force for the realization of national rejuvenation. No force can hinder it. "Unity determines everything." This is the common belief of the Chinese people today. We are willing to abide by this saying as a guide for future literary and art creation or the development of literary and art theories.

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Cables Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department to Release Detained Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, due to the detention of rice purchased by Shanghai merchants in Yueqing and Pingyang counties of Zhejiang Province, specially cabled the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department to release it. The cable stated: To the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department, on the 28th of this month, the Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Trade Association sent a letter stating that, according to a joint letter from the trade members Qianfeng Yu Dehao, etc., in view of the insufficient supply of rice in the city, they specially ordered rice from Yueqing and Pingyang from Zhaochunji Grain Store in Yongjia County in November of last year, a total of 9,700 bags, and agreed to ship it to Shanghai in succession within the year. They had previously sent a letter to your association to forward a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to fill out a certificate and submit it to the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department to allow Yueqing and Pingyang counties to release it. Now, according to a letter from Zhaochunji Grain Store, the county magistrates of the two counties are still unwilling to issue transportation permits, so the stored rice has not yet been shipped to Shanghai. After investigation, the rice has been ordered for more than two months, and the period of the great conclusion is approaching in an instant. Not only is rice in urgent need of supply, but the financial situation is urgent, and the members, etc., can hardly bear the losses any longer. Moreover, the Civil Affairs Department has already approved the case, and the county magistrates of the two counties deliberately make things difficult, which is unreasonable. In desperation, we specially send a letter to your association to ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to quickly cable the Zhejiang Provincial Civil Affairs Department to order Yueqing and Pingyang counties to issue permits for release. In order to maintain the food supply for Shanghai citizens and to facilitate commercial transportation, etc., to the meeting. After investigation, the Provisional Regulations for Food Regulation promulgated by the Executive Yuan state that food should be allowed to circulate freely within the national territory, and all provinces and cities should immediately stop the prohibition of transportation. Yueqing and Pingyang counties are also in the list of the Yuan Decree that is said to stop the prohibition of transportation. The 9,700 bags of rice purchased by Qianfeng Yu Dehao, etc., have been certified by a legal organization as being necessary for domestic civilian food, and should be allowed to circulate freely. However, the county magistrates of Pingle and other two counties still do not issue transportation bodies, which makes the temporary method of rice and grain regulation equal to a fictitious setting. If this is the case, where is the authority of the government orders, and what basis will the merchants have? It is reasonable to report the situation and cable your department to review it, and quickly transfer the order to release it, which is the most anticipated. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully, thrift.</p>
<h3>Celebration Committee Urges Landlords to Pay Donations</h3>

It is reported that some landlords have not yet completed the procedures. The committee will end the compilation of the credit record and send a letter to urge again yesterday, and also ask the Land Bureau to transfer the order to urge. All district landlords who have not paid the donation and receipts should expedite the process three days in advance to clear the formalities. In addition, the Celebration Committee will commend the groups and individuals in the city who donated for the sake of raising funds. The names of the groups or the names of the individuals who donated more than 100 yuan have been submitted to the Municipal Government for rewards in order to promote encouragement.</p>

<h3>Municipal Government Expresses Condolences for Death of Austrian Consul</h3>
<p>Orders All Affiliated Agencies to Fly Flags at Half-Mast for One Day Yesterday</p>

<h3>Special Cash Guarantee Measures (Continued)</h3>
<p>Full Text Released by the Banking Association</p>
<p>Article 14: If an employee resigns or is dismissed from the bank, his Class A guarantee deposit and interest shall be returned only after six months from the date of his departure, if there is no situation as described in Article 12 of these rules.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Cases of employee embezzlement often occur after a considerable period of time after dismissal. Therefore, this article stipulates that the Class A guarantee deposit will only be returned six months after dismissal, in order to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>Article 15: When an employee applies for the return of his Class A guarantee deposit, he shall return the employee's Class A guarantee deposit passbook for cancellation, and the recipient shall sign and seal the passbook.</p>
<p>(Explanation) This article stipulates that the recipient shall sign and seal the passbook to indicate that the original amount paid has been fully recovered, in order to show its importance.</p>
<p>Article 16: If an employee's Class A guarantee deposit passbook is lost during the service period, he may state the reasons and apply to the head office through the service bank for a replacement. If it is lost after leaving the bank, he shall find a guarantor, fill out a receipt, and be allowed to return the principal and interest. The original passbook shall also be declared invalid by the employee in the newspaper.</p>
<p>(Explanation) This article is the ordinary procedure that should be followed when applying for a replacement for a lost document.</p>
<p>Article 17: When an employee who has resigned, been suspended, retained, laid off, or dismissed returns to the bank to work, if his original Class A guarantee deposit has not been returned, he may return the old passbook, settle the interest, and exchange it for a new passbook.</p>
<p>(Explanation) This article is to make the interest on the Class A guarantee deposit clear for the employee's service periods before and after. Therefore, it is stipulated that the old passbook shall be used to settle the interest and exchange it for a new passbook for rectification.</p>
<p>Article 18: An employee who resigns or is dismissed from the bank shall have his Class B guarantee deposit fully or partially refunded only after six months from the date of his departure, and after the proportional compensation of Article 13. However, after the implementation of these rules, an employee who has served in the bank for less than five years, or who is dismissed or expelled in accordance with the Bank Employee Reward and Punishment Rules, shall not be refunded his Class B guarantee deposit.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Since the nature of the Class B guarantee deposit is equal to credit insurance, it is in accordance with the principle of risk sharing in insurance, the so-called "Law of Average" Law of Average, to compensate for the loss of B with the credit insurance fee of A. In fact, according to the credit insurance methods of various banks in China and foreign countries, the credit insurance fee cannot be recovered. However, for the sake of consideration, the principal or balance of the Class B guarantee deposit will be refunded, actively encouraging employees to be cautious and fair, and passively reducing the occurrence of embezzlement. Because if there is embezzlement, in addition to the individual's private property being compensated first, the Class B guarantee deposit jointly deducted by the employees will be used to make up for the loss. The more embezzlement, the greater the loss suffered by the employees, and the less embezzlement, the less the loss of the employees. It is enough to make everyone have a relationship of interest and supervise each other closely. As a result, it can arouse the moral concept of employees and achieve the effect of eliminating abuses and purifying customs. If it is stipulated that it will not be refunded, then once the Class B guarantee deposit is paid, it will be like a donation. Employees are indifferent to it and cannot have a personal interest concept, that is, there is no active effect. The provision of refund in these rules is better than no refund. If they are dismissed or expelled for committing a mistake, then their behavior has violated the expectations of the bank, and there is no need to encourage them again. Therefore, it will not be refunded. It is also stipulated that service must be full three years, which is to stimulate the employee's perseverance in service.</p>
<p>Article 19: An employee who receives the principal or the balance of the Class B guarantee deposit shall issue a receipt.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Same as Article 15</p>
<p>Article 20: The principal and interest of the Class A guarantee deposit and the principal of the Class B guarantee deposit (all or the balance) of a deceased employee shall be received by the beneficiary of the deceased's will, or by the legal heirs if there is no will.</p>
<p>(Explanation) If an employee's Class A and Class B guarantee deposits have not been used to compensate for losses, they can be returned to the bank six months after retirement. Therefore, the two guarantee deposits are the employee's personal property. If they die, they should be received by the person designated by their will. If there is no will, they should be received by the legal heirs.</p>
<p>Article 20: If there is no compensation situation as stipulated in Article 11 of the employee guarantee reserve fund stipulated in Article 11, or the amount of compensation is very small, the chairman and general manager may approve the extraction of a certain percentage to carry out employee welfare facilities.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Welfare facilities can actively improve the morality and cultivation of employees. In European and American countries, bank personnel management pays great attention to this point. This article stipulates that the guarantee reserve fund may be extracted to carry out welfare facilities after a considerable period of time if there is no compensation situation or the amount of compensation is very small. Therefore, it shows that the existence or absence of embezzlement is related to the personal interests of employees, and also shows the bank's intention to reward good deeds, so that employees can reflect on themselves when they are free, and change if they have improper behavior, and work harder if they don't.</p>
<p>Article 21: The storage, receipt, and payment of various employee guarantee deposits shall be handled by the head office.</p>
<p>(Explanation) Same as Article 18</p>
<p>Article 23: After an employee embezzlement case occurs, other employees in the same bank branch who have one of the following circumstances shall be subject to joint and several sanctions. The methods shall be handled in accordance with the Bank Employee Reward and Punishment Rules.</p>
<p>㊀ Those who jointly or jointly handle the job in the same bank branch</p>
<p>㊁ The direct supervisor of the same bank branch</p>
<p>㊂ Other persons who should be subject to joint and several sanctions as approved by the chairman and general manager</p>
<p>(Explanation) Employees in the same bank branch spend the day together, and their relationship is very close. In the past, it was often because the supervisor neglected management, was too indifferent to colleagues, and there was a lack of mutual supervision among colleagues, and there were situations of knowing but not reporting, which prevented the budding of embezzlement. Therefore, this article stipulates joint and several sanctions. All those who have one of the first to third circumstances should be subject to joint and several sanctions. Because within this scope, all colleagues should pay close attention to each other, so as not to lose the spirit of internal restraint. If they do not pay attention, they will be subject to joint and several sanctions, and they are also to blame. Moreover, this method has long been used in the habit of our country's banking industry. These rules only add an explicit provision.</p>
<p>Article 24: If an employee discovers or reports an embezzlement by an employee, and the bank is not subject to or reduces losses, the person who discovers or reports shall be exempted from joint and several sanctions, and the bank shall also reward him. The methods shall be handled in accordance with the Bank Employee Reward and Punishment Rules. However, if the reported case is found to be untrue, the chairman (general manager) shall sanction it.</p>
<p>(Explanation) If an employee embezzlement case occurs, other employees shall be subject to joint and several sanctions in accordance with the provisions of Article 23 of these rules, which is an ex post remedy principle. If this provision discovers or reports the embezzlement of colleagues, and the bank is not subject to or reduces losses, then the whistleblower will be rewarded. The purpose is to urge employees to supervise each other and adopt a pre-prevention principle. However, in order to prevent employees from making false accusations for personal gain, it is stipulated that those who make false accusations shall also be subject to sanctions. As for the sanction methods, it seems to be out of the question, so it is not stipulated in detail, only to be determined temporarily by the chairman (general manager).</p>
<p>Article 25: These rules shall be implemented from the date of the Republic of China after being resolved by the board of directors.</p>
<p>(Note) This plan has been researched for two years. The charter has been reviewed and finally revised by the industry. (Seventh Revision) (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Wang Yiting, Zhu Ziqiao and Others Initiate the Construction of a Chinese Temple Pagoda in India</h3>
<p>In Memory of Xuanzang; Land Has Been Purchased in Nalanda to Provide a Place for Chinese Pilgrims; The Buddhist Association Orders National Fundraising</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association sent a letter to the branch associations across the country, stating: “Case approved: Wang Yiting, Zhu Ziqiao, Feng Yangshan, and other gentlemen of the Shanghai Buddhist Laymen's Association wrote, 'Since Mahayana Buddhism crossed into China, the holy land of origin in the five Tianzhu has declined day by day and gradually perished. It has been several thousand years. Many of the holy places of the Shakya clan have fallen into the hands of foreign heretics. For example, the old site of the first Dharma wheel in Sarnath has been abandoned as a pigsty. It has only recently been redeemed by the Great Bodhi Society and rebuilt the temple. The Bodhi tree is also occupied by Indian Muslims for a long time. Buddhist disciples have called and run around, seeking a seat and not easily getting it. The image of the end of Dharma is so extremely lamentable and painful. In recent times, Buddhists in Siam, Burma, Ceylon, and other places have gradually awakened, and they have collectively sought to restore and establish temples in various important holy sites in order to increase the power of the entire Buddhist community and also provide food and lodging for their own Buddhist believers who come to worship. The intention is very good. Our country has received the true tradition of the great Dharma and is deeply grateful for it. However, our country has not yet followed up and undertaken this act of protecting the holy land. Compared with the small vehicle countries in Southeast Asia, we are lagging behind. This is due to our lack of hearing and seeing, but it is also our shame. Now there is a monk named Fuxin Bhikkhu who travels far to India to worship the pagodas. He has been practicing asceticism alone for more than ten years. He feels the strength of the heretics in that place, the difficulty of studying Buddhism and practicing the Tao, and the hardship of Chinese monks who travel far to the holy land and have nowhere to rely on. Therefore, he bought four acres of land in the Nalanda Temple area and made a vow to raise funds to build a Chinese Buddhist temple. He returned to discuss with Yiting and others, and they all agreed that the Nalanda Temple was the place where Tang Xuanzang learned the Dharma. The bright brilliance of Eastern Buddhism originated from this place. Remembering the kindness of the Dharma and the gratitude of returning to feed, the four disciples of our country should give up their heads, eyes, hands, and feet to protect, maintain, revitalize, and promote it. The site is not far from the Bodhi tree, and it is convenient to reach by car. Pilgrims can travel back and forth conveniently. Building a temple here not only commemorates the merits of the ancient ancestors who transmitted the scriptures and sought the Dharma, but also serves as the foundation for the revival of Mahayana Buddhism. People in our country who visit northern India also have a place to gather and rest. Its importance cannot be overstated. The construction plan requires approximately 13,000 yuan in national currency, which will be expanded when there are additional donations. Therefore, we would like to suggest to your association to kindly give your support and send a letter to each branch association to raise funds on our behalf. Currently, there are more than 400 branch associations. Assuming that each association can raise at least 20 yuan on our behalf, the expected amount will not be difficult to fulfill.' After investigation, the construction of a Chinese Buddhist pagoda and temple in Nalanda Temple, India, has a significant relationship with Chinese Buddhism and should be happily supported. Therefore, we specially send a letter to your association to check and hope that you will transfer it to various temples and enthusiastically provide assistance so that we can see its completion. All donations raised are hoped to be sent to our association for transfer. That is what we hope."</p>
<h3>Tiger Rickshaw Driver Zhang Chang'en Crippled by Accident</h3>
<p>Petition Submitted to the Municipal Government by the French Concession Ratepayers' Association for Negotiation</p>
<p>The French Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association submitted a petition to the municipal government yesterday, stating: "Regarding the petition, we have received a letter from lawyer Yu Xiji, briefly stating that Zhang Pan-shi has tearfully recounted that her husband, Zhang Chang'en, 38 years old, from Tongzhou, was a tiger rickshaw driver. On the 7th of this month, at 6:00 PM, after completing his work, while walking home near the Guangci Hospital on Rue Pere Robert, he was hit from behind by a Westerner's car, injuring his left hand and foot. He was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment for more than ten days, but the swelling remained, and the arm could not be moved. The police refused to provide a copy of the accident report. However, upon inspection, the tiger rickshaw, retrieved from the police station on the 19th, had the number "Westerner 128" written on it in white powder, indicating that the driver was undoubtedly Western Police Officer No. 128 of the French Police. The family consists of the couple and two sons and two daughters, the eldest being eleven years old and the youngest only four months old, all relying on Zhang Chang'en's income. Now that he has become disabled, the family of six has no means of livelihood. Furthermore, the police's refusal to provide an accident report is even more shocking. Left with no choice, we can only request your association to vigorously negotiate to achieve the goal of punishing the perpetrator and providing compensation. Therefore, we hereby submit this letter, hoping that you will consider the plight of the poor and weak, approve an investigation and negotiation to uphold justice and maintain the law." In response to this, the association immediately sent personnel to investigate. It was reported that the car involved in the accident was occupied by a French army officer, and the police are keeping the car number strictly confidential and have also ordered that no visits be allowed to the injured person. Such unreasonable oppression will leave the residents of the French Concession without any protection. In addition to replying to lawyer Yu to file a lawsuit according to the law, we respectfully request your review and approval to negotiate for the sake of public convenience."</p>
<h3>Young Daughter Pledged for Rent Dies Tragically from Abuse</h3>
<p>Lu Qingchen Accused</p>
<p>Huo Changfu, 26 years old, a bathhouse attendant from Jiangbei at Lishui Pond outside Xiaonanmen in the Nanshi district, owed rent for one month to Lu Qingchen, 45 years old, from Hebei, who runs the Yixingshun incense paper shop at No. 74 Yixing Lane behind the Bureau Gate since October of last year. He therefore pledged his biological eight-year-old daughter, named Dai-dizi, recognizing Lu as her adoptive father to offset the debt. However, after Lu adopted Dai-dizi, he repeatedly abused her, beating her until she was injured and became ill. She died yesterday morning at 4:00 AM. Lu then requested a small coffin from the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for burial. Huo Changfu learned of this and brought Lu to the police station, notifying the local bailiff to report to the District Court. Prosecutor Li was appointed by the court to lead inspectors to the scene for an examination yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. It was determined that she died from injuries. The original plaintiff and defendant are scheduled to appear in court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Taoist Priest Robbed</h3>
<p>Mouth Filled with Mud, Unable to Resist</p>
<p>Shen Xiaobao, a native of Pudong, is a Taoist priest. His home is located in Shenjia Lane in Pudong. The day before yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 PM, as darkness fell, Shen was returning home with twenty-two yuan in banknotes he earned from conducting rituals. Unexpectedly, while walking along the eastern end of Xinma Road in Yangjiadu near the Jiangjia wooden bridge, three robbers with northern accents ambushed him in the darkness. Two robbers rushed out and grabbed Shen's hands, pressing him to the ground, while the third robber grabbed mud from the ground and stuffed it into Shen's mouth, preventing him from shouting. Shen resisted stubbornly, and his cheeks were punched, causing his nose and mouth to swell. Unable to resist, the robbers took a lined spring fur robe, twenty-two yuan in banknotes, a key, and a police whistle. After the robbers fled, Shen spat out the mud and rushed to report to the local security corps, but the robbers had already disappeared.</p>
<h3>Absurd Master Practices "Collecting Yin to Supplement Yang"</h3>
<p>Illegal Imprisonment Case Adjourned Pending Judgment After Yesterday's Hearing</p>
<p>Zhang Shengzhi, a 45-year-old native of Jiangxi residing at No. 53 Baoxing Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, is engaged in the cotton cloth business in Shanghai. Deluded by superstitious rumors of "collecting yin to supplement yang" to prolong life, he selects young women as servants in his residence to perform inhumane acts. Recently, on the 20th of this month, Zhang hired Zhu Cuizhen, an 18-year-old woman from Wuxi, from a nearby matchmaking shop to work as a senior maid. The next morning, he attempted to commit indecent acts, but the woman refused. Zhang forcibly took her gold ring and bracelet and locked her in a room before leaving. The woman shouted, and a cohabitant released her. The woman then reported to the French police, and Detective Wang Zhihao went to investigate and arrested Zhang, finding several indecent photos on his person. He was taken back to the police station and sent to the Second Special District Court. The lawyer from the police department filed a public prosecution for the crime of illegal imprisonment. He was granted bail of 600 yuan, and a further hearing was scheduled. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Judge Liao Yunting presided over a renewed hearing in the First Criminal Court. Lawyer Fei Xizhen from the police department stated the case and the articles of indictment. Detective Wang Zhihao reported the circumstances of the arrest. The plaintiff, Zhu Cuizhen, testified that the defendant came to the matchmaking shop on the 20th to hire her as a maid. When she arrived at his house, she asked where the madam was. The defendant said she had gone out to buy groceries and then said she had gone to play mahjong. That night, the defendant and his wife did not return, and she stayed alone in the room. The next morning, the defendant returned, took away her gold ring and bracelet, locked the door, and left. She shouted, and a cohabitant came and let her out. Later, the cohabitant told her that the defendant had replaced more than twenty senior maids in a month. She then reported to the police station and requested an investigation. The defendant denied the facts, claiming that his wife had returned to her hometown on business and denying any illegal imprisonment. He hired a lawyer to defend him. The court, after reviewing the case, considered the facts clear and announced the conclusion of the debate, scheduling the judgment for the 30th of this month. The defendant was released on the original bail.</p>

<h3>Import Tax on Shipbuilding Materials Not Yet Waived Recently</h3>
<p>Shipbuilding Industry Hopes Government Will Pay Attention</p>
<p>Recently, various newspapers have reported that import taxes on shipbuilding materials will be waived in the future. According to the authorities of the Jiangnan Shipyard, "China's industry is not yet fully developed, and most shipbuilding materials are purchased from abroad. Both freight and taxes are required, and the cost is higher than that of ships built abroad. Moreover, ships built abroad are exempt from import duties when they return, making it even more difficult for domestic shipyards to compete, affecting the future of the shipping industry and the livelihoods of workers. This shipyard has petitioned the government to levy taxes on all ships built abroad that are imported back into the country or to exempt domestic shipyards from taxes on imported shipbuilding materials to ensure fairness, but it has not yet been approved. The recent reports in newspapers that import taxes on shipbuilding materials will be waived in the future are not true."</p>
<h3>Embezzled Huge Sums, Went to Jiaxing for Prostitution, Arrested for Extravagant Behavior</h3>
<p>Xu Weizhong Hired His Brother-in-law as Accountant, Trusted the Wrong Person</p>
<p>Xu Weizhong, from Zhenhai, Ningbo, opened the Zhenghe Cotton Cloth Shop at No. 429 Ningbo Road and hired his brother-in-law, Jiang Baoxiang (also known as Li'e, 33 years old, also from Zhenhai) as an accountant at a monthly salary of twenty yuan. Recently, a customer from Hakka ordered a large batch of cotton cloth from Zhenghe Shop and paid 4,500 yuan in Ankang Bank notes and 3,500 yuan in Junshe Bank notes, which Xu handed over to Jiang for safekeeping. However, Jiang harbored malicious intentions and stole the two bank notes, exchanged them for cash at the respective banks, and fled without a trace. Xu reported this to the Old Gate Police Station and requested the First Special District Court to issue an arrest warrant. After Jiang suddenly obtained a large sum of money, he spent a portion of it to buy clothing and accessories, including three watches. The next day, he went to Sijing and then to Qingpu, staying at a small inn. That night, 1,420 yuan was stolen. Jiang, fearing that an investigation would expose his own crime, did not delve into the matter. He then went to Jiaxing and stayed in Room 7 of the Andong Inn outside the city. Because he had obtained the money easily, Jiang squandered it on prostitution and lavish spending in Jiaxing. In less than a month, he spent over a thousand yuan, arousing the suspicion of local police officers, who detained him. They found 5,471.6 yuan in cash and clothing, watches, and other items worth over 200 yuan. After questioning, they learned the full story of Jiang. The police station then notified the Shanghai Old Gate Police Station, and Chinese Detective Pang Ruiqing and Detective Zhu Shanghe went to Jiaxing, brought Jiang back the night before last, and escorted him to the First Criminal Court of the First District Court yesterday morning. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station filed a lawsuit against him for embezzlement under Article 336, Section 2 of the Criminal Law and stated that the defendant had already confessed at the police station. However, it is still necessary to verify whether his confession is consistent with the facts, so he requested an extension of the hearing. Jiang Baoxiang completely denied the charges. As for the stolen money, in addition to the 5,400+ yuan recovered and the 1,400+ yuan stolen, there was still over 1,000 yuan, which he spent on prostitution and shopping. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau to Reduce Road Workers by Lottery This Morning</h3>
<p>All Road Workers Resolutely Oppose, Petitioning in All Directions Today</p>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reports: "The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession is carrying out staff reductions and job cuts, planning to dismiss nine-tenths of the 1,200 road workers in the Public Works Department by means of a lottery. Upon hearing this news, all the road workers were alarmed and formed the Shanghai Public Concession Road Workers Mutual Aid Association, demanding that the authorities withdraw the decision. It is understood that the Public Works Bureau is still proceeding with its original plan and has scheduled a lottery for this morning. In addition to resolutely refusing to participate in the lottery and returning their work permits, the workers have also decided to petition the Chinese Board of Directors and various agencies and organizations today, requesting that they uphold justice and provide assistance."</p>
<p>Lottery This Morning: The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession has decided to reduce nine-tenths of its road workers and will hold a lottery at 6:00 AM this morning to determine who stays and who goes. The dismissal plan is announced as follows: "Notice: In accordance with the bureau's order, all possible expenses should be reduced. Now that the salaries of staff have been reduced, economies should also be made in the area of workers. The measures are as follows: (1) Foremen and first-class workers: From January 30, 1937, until further notice, except for the Luo Biegen division, the workers hired in each district will be limited to foremen and first-class workers. The wages of these foremen and workers will be paid weekly in accordance with the current method, but if the workers are not assigned to special tasks, the amount of wages they receive will still be in accordance with the current regulations: (a) Foremen receive 79 cents, (b) 65 cents, (c) 57 cents, (d) 49 cents. (2) Luo Biegen division: In addition to foremen and first-class workers, this division also hires second-class and third-class workers. The method of paying wages is the same as that stipulated for foremen and first-class workers. The daily wage amounts for these workers will still be in accordance with the current regulations: (a) 79 cents, (b) 65 cents, (c) 57 cents, (d) 49 cents. (3) Workers with special tasks: Workers performing special tasks will be selected from among the craftsmen and first-class workers based on their performance, with a maximum of 50 workers per district. The employment period for these workers will be one week. These workers must have been trained and demonstrate their skills during work. The selection will be the responsibility of the deputy engineer and chief inspector of each district. Furthermore, for the benefit of the workers themselves, all workers are hereby warned that any direct delivery of any property to the foremen or any other staff member is prohibited and will result in immediate dismissal. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Road Workers Panic: Over 1,200 road workers in the entire Public Concession are in a state of panic because the Bureau is disregarding the livelihood of the workers and dismissing nine-tenths of them. Although they have appealed in all directions, demanding the withdrawal of the decision, they have not received any satisfactory response. The lottery is still scheduled to be held this morning. The workers have decided to refuse to participate in the lottery and return their work permits. They have prepared petitions and will petition the Chinese Board of Directors Yu Yanxiang, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, and the General Labor Union today, requesting that they provide strong assistance.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Previously Borrowed Money From Three Banks</h3>
<p>Plan to Transfer Collateral</p>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports: "In 1935, the Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan of financial public bonds to assist the money industry, establishing the Money Industry Supervision Committee. The Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and various commercial banks and the Money Industry Reserve Bank lent money to various money shops. The 7 million yuan from various commercial banks and the Money Industry Reserve Bank have long been repaid, but the 18 million yuan from the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications have been repeatedly extended, and approximately 14 million yuan has not yet been repaid. Most of the outstanding loans are from the Henglai and Hengxing shops, which have already closed down, followed by the Yutai and Shengchang shops. The collateral is all land deeds, but due to the decline in real estate prices, no one is interested, so the loans from the closed shops cannot be repaid, and the interest due is also delayed. The borrowing shops have requested the Money Industry Supervision Committee to negotiate with the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications to transfer the collateral to the three banks, which has been approved. Now, the prices of the collateral of the various shops are being estimated to facilitate the transfer."</p>

<h3>Overview of Public Utilities in the Public Concession Last Year</h3>
<p>Summary of Reports from the Telephone Company and Others</p>
<p>Telephone Company: "Since the Telephone Bureau changed to charging by the number of calls on March 1st of last year, the basic telephone rates have been reduced, and the number of telephone subscribers has increased by about one-tenth compared to the previous year (excluding private branch exchanges and public telephones, there were a total of 48,761 subscribers at the end of the previous year, which increased to 53,326 subscribers at the end of last year). The company's service efficiency is excellent, and telephone installation and repair are completed in a short time. As of the end of last year, 94% of the telephones installed by the company were fully automatic, and the remaining 6% were installed in the western district on roads outside the concession and were manual. The long-distance telephone equipment in the city is expanding daily. Since February of last year, Shanghai and Japan have been able to communicate by radio. Long-distance telephone calls between Shanghai and San Francisco, London, Manila, and other places are being tested and will be available to the public this year. Before September of last year, domestic long-distance telephone calls could only reach major cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. After the initial completion of the China Telephone Bureau's nine-province plan, long-distance telephone calls between Shanghai and Wuhan were available. Long-distance telephone calls to Guangzhou were also available on December 9th. Long-distance telephone calls to Hong Kong will also be available to the public soon. There were only 32 public telephones in the concession in the previous year. By the end of last year, there were 207. More and more large and small offices and large residences are installing private branch exchanges because they are economical and convenient, and everyone enjoys using them."</p>
<p>Water Company: "Due to the lower temperatures in the spring and summer of last year and the implementation of conservation measures in the area, the amount of water used by residents of the concession totaled over 15 billion gallons, a decrease of about 5% compared to the previous year. Only slightly more than three miles of new main water pipes were installed. The water company is negotiating with relevant parties on the water supply issue in the western district, and progress is smooth. It is hoped that residents in the western district will soon be supplied by the company. All equipment of the company is efficient and of good quality, and the water pipe pressure has been maintained to the level agreed upon between the Bureau of Public Works and the company."</p>
<p>Public Bus Company: "Last year, the Public Bus Company extended its routes in three places, and the traffic on all routes has been improved. To facilitate residents in the western district, the company added two new-style special express buses, one running between the Hongqiao Golf Club and the Bund, and one running between Zhaofeng Park and the Bund. The "A" special line was extended to the intersection of Columbia Road and Anhe Temple Road, the "A" line was extended to the corner of Kaixuan Road and Daxi Road, and the Ninth Line was also extended, westward to Zhaofeng Park and eastward to the Military Industry Road, connecting with the public buses operated by the Municipal Public Works Bureau, allowing passengers to reach the city center directly. The fares for all routes were uniformly calculated in national currency, making it more convenient to exchange money. The total number of passengers throughout the year was over 35 million, and the mileage of vehicles on the routes totaled over 5.7 million miles, both of which increased compared to the previous year."</p>
<p>Tram Company: "Last year, the Tram Company added ten new trolleybuses. The tram line on Yangshupu Road is being extended to Zhoujiazui and is expected to be completed at the beginning of this year. There were no changes in fares and stations last year. As of the end of last year, the total length of the tracks was 18.012 miles, a decrease of 78 miles compared to the previous year. Calculated on a single track, the total length of the tracks was 34.706 miles, the same as the previous year. There were a total of 107 trams with engines, the same number of trailers, and 109 trolleybuses. Trams on all routes traveled over 10.7 million miles and carried over 110 million passengers."</p>
<p>Electric Power Company: "The first half of last year saw a decline in electricity consumption by residents of the concession compared to the previous year due to the economic downturn. However, the second half of the year saw an increase, but the increase was not as large as in previous years. The company's equipment is in good condition, and its service efficiency has always been excellent. There are a total of 78,934 electricity users, and the total power transmitted is over 320,000 kilowatts. The total power generated by the power plants is over 800 million kilowatts."</p>
<p>Gas Company: "The new gas storage facility built on Yuqiaqing Road has been completed. The facility has four floors and is controlled by a spiral tube, with a capacity of 1.9 million cubic feet of gas. The gas plant on the base of Yangshupu Road has also been completed. There were a total of 13,450 gas users throughout the year, a decrease of 460 users compared to the previous year. The company supplied a total of over 900 million cubic feet of gas for individual residences, public and private street lights, and wholesale sales, including the company's own use."</p>
<h3>Dai Qin-sun Takes a Maid as Concubine, Abandons Her, Involved in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Also Has Affair with Another Maid, Abandons Old Love, Chen Hui-zhen Sues in Court, Asks for Alimony</p>
<p>Dai Qin-sun, a wealthy businessman from Suzhou residing at No. 10 Er Deli, Meibaige Road, has always been fond of women. He often takes advantage of young maids he hires. In the spring of 1932, Chen Hui-zhen, a woman from Suzhou, came to Shanghai to find work because she was not tolerated by her stepmother. She was hired by the Dai family. After a month, the love between master and servant matured, and she surprisingly learned to be a lady. Although she did not live in a separate house, Dai had already promised to make her his fifth concubine, so the family all changed the way they addressed her, calling her Fifth Miss instead of her name. This lasted until last year, a period of five years. Unexpectedly, Dai then became involved with a maid named Zhang A-jin and decided to abandon Hui-zhen. He negotiated with lawyer Zhang Ji-zu, who practices law in Suzhou, to have Hui-zhen go to the law office of Li Zu-yu to sign a severance agreement, giving her a thousand yuan. Hui-zhen then returned to Suzhou. Recently, she hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Dai Qin-sun in the First Special District Court, asking for alimony. The lawsuit stated, "Since being seduced by Dai into adultery, and especially after taking me as his concubine, my parents learned of this. To avoid disputes, Dai asked Xu Lin-jine to retrieve my marriage certificate. Unexpectedly, Dai became infatuated with the new and abandoned the old. The agreement I signed, I really did not know that it was a severance agreement, and I only realized I had been deceived after Zhang Ji-zu told me after returning to Suzhou. I feel that the agreement is invalid and should be approved to sever the family relationship. I am now only 28 years old, and calculating a life of sixty years, I request the court to order the defendant to pay 60 yuan per month for my future life, totaling 23,760 yuan in national currency." Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuki held a hearing. The defendant, Dai Qin-sun, did not appear. Chen Hui-zhen recounted the process of Dai Qin-sun first using sweet words to lure her, then becoming tired of the old and fond of the new, and finally betraying his promise and abandoning her. She also stated that half of the thousand yuan given by the defendant was originally her savings over the years. I was originally betrothed to a Zhang, but the defendant asked Xu Lin-jine to retrieve the eight characters. At that time, he said that if I did not retrieve the eight characters, he would die." Xu Lin-jine also testified that the defendant asked her to retrieve the eight characters. Lawyer Li Zu-yu also testified that Zhang Ji-zu accompanied the plaintiff to the office to make the agreement. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated that if there was really no relationship between master and servant, why would they need a lawyer to certify the agreement when dismissing a maid. He also presented several letters from the defendant to the plaintiff as evidence for reference. Finally, the defendant's lawyer argued, denying the facts of love between master and servant and the promise to take her as a concubine. After the court hearing, the judge announced that the judgment would be delivered on the afternoon of February 2.</p>

<p>The clergyman, an old man from Yangzhou named Wang Bao-lu (59 years old), had a long-standing feud with Qin Geng-tao, a young man from Chuansha, Pudong, who worked at the Bible Society at No. 58 Hong Kong Road, over trivial matters. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, at 7:40 PM, Wang brought a bottle of acid to Qin Geng-tao's house. He went upstairs into their bedroom, and without asking any questions, he roared and splashed the acid on Qin's head and face, and destroyed the objects in the room. He fled back to No. 7 Sida Lane, Shigaota Road, and the patrol officer of the Huaihai Road Police Station arrested Wang and confiscated the acid bottle and detained the man at the First Special District Court. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court, and the lawyer of the Public Works Bureau, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the second landlord of Qin Geng-tao, Qin's wife, and the cohabitant had come to court and could testify to what happened at the time of the incident, requesting a hearing. According to the testimony of the third landlord, Xu Yonglin, at that time, the defendant knocked on the door and I opened the door. I saw him carrying a paper package and went to see Qin on the upper floor. Then I went out because I had something to do and I don't know what happened. Xu's wife, Ms. Xu, testified that suddenly she heard a noise on the upper floor and the sound of objects being destroyed. The defendant shouted such words as "ungrateful, don't be afraid of going to court to be shot" and other words. Xu Jin, a neighbor, testified, "I heard Mr. Qin shouting for help. I thought it was a robbery. I went out to the pavilion to see it and saw an empty bottle abandoned by the door. Many of the objects in the front building were knocked down." Qin's newly married wife, Ms. Wang, testified that she was not at home when they were arguing, but her marriage was arranged by her mother and there was no quarrel with her son-in-law and no change to Buddhism or other things. The court asked the defendant about these. The defendant's testimony was cunning and evasive. The court ordered that the debate begin. Lawyer Zhang said, "Christianity is based on charity and peace. It should not be due to trivial matters. The case is about cruelty and malice, wanting to blind Qin's eyes. The court is asked to punish." Judge Zhong sentenced Wang Baolu to two years and six months of imprisonment, and the acid bottle was confiscated.</p>

<h3>Ham Industry Again Requests Exemption from Increased Freight Rates</h3>

The meeting was chaired by Xu Senfang. They discussed the association's request to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Administration for exemption from increased freight rates. They received a reply from the two railway administrations today, stating that the current increase in ham freight rates was ordered by the Ministry of Railways and could not be arbitrarily changed by the railway administration. It is believed that ham is an agricultural product, and many farmers in eastern Zhejiang rely on it as a sideline to farming. In these times of agricultural and commercial decline, how can they increase the burden? Therefore, it was resolved to send another letter to the railway administration, forwarding it to the Ministry of Railways, earnestly requesting exemption, it is said.</p>

Accordingly, a copy of the original telegram is sent to your association, requesting your review.

<h3>Singer Lai Ling's Case of Obstructing Public Morality</h3>
<p>Dance Troupe Owner Jiang Boying Accused - Years of Affair, Suddenly Unwilling to Marry</p>
<p>Lai Ling, also known as Shuming, is a woman from Fuzhou, currently 21 years old, residing at No. 25 Daodeguo, Beile Road, French Concession. She loves singing and dancing and enjoys great fame in the dance world. There was a certain Jiang Boying, who has been in the film industry for a long time. In October of the 24th year, he organized a Star Technology Dance Troupe. Because he heard of Lai's fame, he tried to recruit her into the troupe. On the 19th of that month, he signed a contract with a monthly salary of 7,000 yuan and a term of six months. Since Lai joined the troupe, Jiang has treated her very well, so the two had a very harmonious relationship. Soon, an ambiguous relationship developed. In January of last year, the Star Technology Troupe went abroad to perform, performing in Bangkok, Siam, for about a month. In March of last year, he returned to China, and Jiang continued to commit adultery in You Tou, Xiamen, and other places. After returning to Shanghai, they continued to have illicit relations from time to time. Jiang also took responsibility for No. 17 Gaofu Lane, Shilin Road, as a place to hide his mistress, and sometimes had secret rendezvous at the Xin Ya Hotel. Jiang had expressed his intention to take Lai as his concubine. In addition to letters exchanged between the two, they also took several photos together, showing their passionate love. However, recently, this hidden affair was discovered by Lai's mother, Lai Sunshi, and Jiang also broke his promise to take Lai as his concubine. The woman's mother then hired lawyer Zhang Yaoqing to file a lawsuit against Jiang in the First Special District Court, requesting punishment for obstructing public morality and family crimes in accordance with Articles 228 and 240 of the Criminal Law. After receiving the complaint, the court stated that Lai Ling's age in the plaintiff's complaint was written as 20 years old and was in the position of the self-suer. The mother was the legal representative. It is necessary to investigate whether Lai Ling is already 20 years old. Therefore, Judge Xiao XieFen summoned the Lai women to the Ninth Criminal Court yesterday afternoon and questioned the age point. According to Lai Ling, she was born on October 18 of the fifth year of the Republic of China, the Year of the Dragon, which means she is already 20 years old. There is no need for a legal representative. The court then ordered the complaint to be corrected and announced a postponement to wait for the defendant to be summoned for further questioning.</p>

<p>Women's Special</p>
<h3>A Word to Unmarried Young Women!</h3>
<p>— Ding Xiaoru</p>
<p>Here, let me tell you something that cannot be ignored!</p>
<p>Marriage is indeed a serious issue in the minds of women. Whether in terms of physiology, psychology, spirit, or life, there will be a tremendous change during this period! In other words, it is also a crucial key to a woman's lifelong happiness.</p>
<p>Of course, love is the element of marriage, and happiness comes from the union of love. But there is something even more important than love, and that is the other person's health.</p>
<p>A discerning woman considers this aspect when choosing a partner. But what I'm talking about doesn't just refer to men who are noticeably thin and weak, with "tuberculosis" or "malignant anemia" and so on. What is easily overlooked is the other person having a "venereal disease that is not easily seen externally, and has become chronic"—"syphilis" or "gonorrhea."</p>
<p>In this prosperous city, especially in the evil Shanghai! The spread of venereal diseases is truly terrifying! There is even a rumor of "nine out of ten men have gonorrhea, and nine out of ten women have leucorrhea." Some people who like to frequent brothels even admit that venereal disease is a kind of fashionable disease. Since most venereal disease patients are fashionable men, then modern women who love to date must pay special attention when choosing a partner!</p>
<p>An unmarried young woman is like a delicate flower about to bloom. If she is unfortunately harmed by this evil disease after marriage, it is like a flower just blooming, suffering the ravages of a storm! It is very easy to wither. We often see some women become more plump and beautiful because of the healthy "endocrine" stimulation and hyperactivity of married life! But some women who were originally in good shape suddenly become surprisingly haggard after marriage! Needless to say, it must be because they have been infected with venereal disease by their husbands. After a woman is infected with venereal disease, "vaginitis" develops locally, causing swelling, pain, and purulent leucorrhea. The external genitalia are ulcerated and eroded, or develop "soft" and "hard chancres," and "syphilitic rashes," etc. It can even cause "endometritis" and "peritonitis," and lead to loss of life! Even if cured, it will definitely hinder fertility, or lead to miscarriage. If it is "syphilis," it will be transmitted to the fetus, and a lifetime of happiness will be sacrificed!</p>
<p>From a family perspective, how can such a married life be considered "happy" and "pleasant"? Since the husband has venereal disease, his usual morals and behavior can be imagined. (People who commit "rape" are mostly afflicted with venereal diseases, as can often be seen in "social news." There are even immoral husbands who cause their wives to develop "rectal gonorrhea," causing anal stenosis and harming them for life.) But because this disease is disreputable, they are even more embarrassed to tell others about their husband's sins. It is truly "a dumb person eating Coptis chinensis, unable to express the bitterness"! Both mentally and physically, they suffer great pain and loss! The husband enjoys himself outside, while the wife suffers innocent disasters. How can this be explained? (Venereal disease is more likely to ruin a woman's youth than childbirth.)</p>
<p>In the past, there was a saying about old-fashioned women getting married: "Getting on the decorated sedan, picking up a bad luck ticket"! That just shows the badness of old-fashioned marriages. But if a new-era woman only pays attention to other conditions when choosing a husband, and neglects the other person's health, and is unfortunately infected with this terrible venereal disease, then that is truly considered "extremely bad luck"!</p>
<p>Since the relationship is so important, how can it be ignored? Therefore, I hope that unmarried young women must be cautious beforehand and never lightly risk their bodies and make this pointless sacrifice. Originally, it is most immoral for a person with venereal disease to marry someone! Although the current laws stipulate that "divorce is allowed if the other party has incurable venereal disease," once infected, it is already too late. It is better to prevent problems before they occur. In Europe and the United States, both men and women exchange "health certificates" when holding a wedding ceremony. This is indeed a good method, and our country may as well emulate it. Especially now that group weddings are prevalent, this procedure can be added during registration. (It is best to designate a doctor to examine them to prevent abuse. If one has venereal disease, they will not be allowed to marry unless completely cured—because if it has become chronic, even the patient often thinks they are completely cured. This is not just a matter of personal happiness and health for women, but it also has a great impact on the race! Aren't we trying to revitalize the nation? Then, a strong country must first have a strong race. If the mother's body is unfortunately harmed by venereal disease, how can strong children be produced? This is something that unmarried women should pay even more attention to!</p>
<h3>Novel Occupations for American Women</h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>America is a country where women's occupations are highly developed, and at the same time, due to the necessities of life, some women's occupations are uniquely styled. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p>㊀ Home Designer　These home designers are hired by families who appreciate modern styles, and they visit once or twice a week. For each family, based on the degree of light, angles, climate, and other factors, they design the placement of all the furniture. Even small items like picture frames and vases are included in the design. The design of the colors of utensils and other items also falls within their scope. As for tablecloths, curtains, and the addition of furniture, it is naturally essential for the designer to be consulted. It is said that this occupation is exclusively held by women. Although there are no precise statistics on the number of people engaged in this profession nationwide, it is at least over a thousand. The most famous designers, such as the Bliss Group in New York, can earn between five and six hundred dollars per month. The average is around one hundred fifty to two hundred fifty dollars. Some are paid per visit, with the highest price being ten dollars. However, some go as low as three or four dollars.</p>
<p>㊁ New Wardrobe Advisor　This is also one of the unique professions for women. The scope of their advice is not limited to new clothing. It includes everything from clothes, shoes, and hats to applying makeup and correcting posture for walking, sitting, and sleeping. Therefore, their services can be said to encompass the formation of all aspects of female beauty. The history of these new wardrobe advisors is less than ten years old, but now they have spread to major cities across the country. New York and Hollywood are particularly concentrated areas for these advisors. In addition, there are many active in Chicago, Washington, and other places. In New York alone, it is said that there are nearly three hundred new wardrobe advisors. Most of these advisors are skilled in painting. They understand the principles of color coordination and various lines, carefully study female beauty around the world, and consider local climate and living habits. Therefore, the women who are shaped by their guidance are always beautiful and harmonious. Their visits are unscheduled and promptly follow the client's call. The fee for each contract ranges from forty to eighty dollars per month. Each visit typically costs between five and ten dollars, with the level of fame of the advisor being the standard for the price. The most famous in New York, Miss Rima and Mrs. Goddard, have accumulated fortunes of over one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand dollars from this profession.</p>
<p>㊂ Companion for Life　There is also a type of profession called "companion for life," which has emerged in the United States in the last three years as a new occupation for women. Whether at home, traveling, or shopping, one can have a companion for life. The main requirements for being a companion for life are to be knowledgeable, have a thorough understanding of all levels of society, have beautiful speech, and, most importantly, be rich in humorous and amusing stories. If one also has some musical or scientific knowledge or experience in household management or infant care, that is even better. In American homes, many high-society women fear the loneliness of living alone. Although there are clubs suitable for women's recreation in every city, there are also quite a few women who do not like going to clubs or are tired of them. To alleviate the mental suffering of these women, it is now generally recognized that there is nothing better than calling a companion for life to talk to. Because a companion for life can say things that suit the client's tastes. They can talk about anything and everything, making you feel extremely satisfied. If you have a companion for life while traveling, it can not only avoid the loneliness of the journey but also bring many conveniences. The fee for this type of companion is typically between five and ten dollars per day. Although it is still in its infancy, it is said that there are already nearly a hundred people in New York alone. It is predicted that its future development will be quite astonishing.</p>

<p>— Shi Hua</p>
<p>When women reach the stage of pregnancy, their mental state is often exceptionally sensitive to light. They dislike sunlight and prefer dimness, and their sense of taste is also overly sensitive. When choosing food, they must choose those with stimulating flavors—especially a preference for sour things. Their senses of smell and hearing are also particularly sensitive; they dislike children and fear noise, and so on.</p>
<p>People often say that this arises from worrying about the pain of childbirth, but this is not really the case; that is only a superficial explanation. The real causes are approximately three major reasons: mechanical, chemical, and fetal detoxification.</p>
<p>1. Mechanical Reasons: During pregnancy, the internal organs of the abdomen gradually expand as the fetus grows, exerting a kind of pressure in all directions, and as a result, obvious changes occur in the mental state.</p>
<p>2. Chemical Reasons: Normally, women's blood contains a lot of water, but during pregnancy, there is even more than before. Therefore, the nutrition of the nerves is prone to a kind of deterioration.</p>
<p>3. Fetal Detoxification Reasons: As the fetus grows day by day in the mother's body, it cannot but have digestion, respiration, and excretion; what is excreted is all in the mother's blood, so the mother inevitably experiences mental obstacles. And the mental life also takes on a unique state.</p>
<p>Sisters who are currently pregnant, now that you understand these causes, you should no longer worry. You should always be happy because the mother's worries are not beneficial to the fetus.</p>
<h3>Women: Go Out Into the Sunlight</h3>
<p>— Zi Fu</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting colder, and people who are always afraid of the cold are about to enter a dormant period again, staying by the stove all day and reluctant to go out easily. In fact, from a hygienic point of view, this is so inappropriate.</p>
<p>Nowadays, people living urban lives, especially those living in large cities, rarely have some opportunities to come into contact with sunlight or engage in sunbathing. On the one hand, this is of course because there are fewer places to come into contact with sunlight in large cities; at the same time, it must also be said that people are not paying attention to this aspect. In particular, Chinese women, who have always had inactive habits, find it difficult to come into contact with sunlight if they live in large cities. Therefore, in recent years, the rate of diseases caused by vitamin D deficiency among women in cities has been increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Now, winter is fast approaching again. Women living in big cities are probably going to have even fewer opportunities to come into contact with sunlight. According to the statistics over the years, in winter, there are more diseases caused by vitamin D deficiency than in any other season. This phenomenon is especially pronounced among women. So, what kind of relationship does sunlight actually have with vitamins?</p>
<p>Anyone with a little bit of hygienic common sense knows that there is a type of light in sunlight called ultraviolet rays. This type of light can pass through the skin and produce vitamins in the blood. From this, it can be known that people who have little contact with sunlight naturally have a smaller amount of vitamin D that can be produced in their blood. If the human body lacks vitamin D, then the metabolism of inorganic salts and phosphates cannot be fully carried out, thereby causing poor bone development and diseases such as rickets and osteomalacia. In general, in places where ultraviolet rays are insufficient, the number of people suffering from these diseases is very large. For example, among black people in New York, it is said that the rate of suffering from this disease reaches ninety percent. Although there are no accurate statistics on the rate of women in Shanghai suffering from this disease, it must be quite alarming.</p>
<p>As the material civilization of cities increases day by day, this terrible phenomenon caused by vitamin D deficiency is becoming more and more profound. The reason is that, on the one hand, the buildings in cities are becoming taller and taller, reducing the scope of sunlight exposure; on the other hand, the increasing concentration of dust and smoke in cities is also a reason for weakening ultraviolet rays. Based on this point, it can be inferred that the terror of vitamin D deficiency will inevitably become even more profound in the future. At the same time, this terror will pose a greater threat to women.</p>
<p>In order to remedy this deficiency, we really need to quickly develop the habit of having more contact with sunlight. Especially in winter, we should not stay at home because we are afraid of the cold. We should make full use of opportunities to have full contact with sunlight. If you can sunbathe for two hours every day, then vitamin D should not be lacking. This can be said to be the best natural method. In addition, in order to supplement the deficiency, eating more foods containing vitamin D is certainly very good. However, the effect of the former is really greater than the latter.</p>
<h3>To Ms. B</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Dai</p>
<p>It is very easy for me to solve the matter about which your father wanted to hear my opinion. He said, "After an old tree in the courtyard died, we planned to replace it with another tree; but this plan has been in the works for almost eight or nine years, and it has not been successful so far. Because trees with a slightly better shape are often extremely expensive, and we do not have this budget in our expenses, so we cannot do it. As for cheap trees, they are all so terrible that they are often not enough to decorate this empty courtyard. What is a suitable way to solve this problem?"</p>
<p>I can solve this matter with an extremely simple method. That is, don't be constrained by the fact that what died before was a tree, so now you must plant a tree. Just plant more than one tree, and the problem is completely solved.</p>
<p>You must know that any tree that can be planted independently must have independent qualifications, so its shape, etc., must be very beautiful, and the price is of course considerable.</p>
<p>Now we are complaining that the price is too expensive and want to be more economical. We might as well first pick a tree that is suitable in size. For example, if you want one that is fifteen feet tall, then as long as it is fifteen feet tall, don't worry about the shape being a bit bad.</p>
<p>After you have selected this tree, see where its shortcomings are? Suppose its treetop is not bad, and it is also proportional, but there is one side that has no branches, almost like a missing corner. Then, just pick another tree and plant it next to it (that is, on the missing side) to supplement its shortcomings. A tree that can stand alone can form a "scene" on its own. A tree that cannot stand alone can be used two or three times to create a "scene"; but when choosing this first tree, there are two points to pay close attention to. First, this supplementary tree only needs to have branches on one side, not on all four sides. Only having branches on one side can compensate for the lack of branches on one side. Second, the second tree must not only be lower than the first tree, but also have a treetop that is proportional to the treetop of the first tree. For example, if the treetop of the first tree is one hundred and sixty degrees, then when the second tree is planted next to it, its treetop must be able to supplement its angle. If the angle is too large or too small, they will not match.</p>
<p>In this way, combining two trees into one scene, both of which are defective, the price will naturally be very cheap. The reasoning for combining three trees into one scene is exactly the same. Once you understand this meaning, you can apply it greatly. And depending on what the shortcomings of the first tree are, it is not necessarily necessary to match another tree to make up for the deficiency. Sometimes, matching a stone or other object can also become a scene. This depends on the shape of the tree, so I cannot give an example.</p>
<p>If a group of more than one tree is used to create a scene, then the most important thing is that the treetops of each tree must be within an angle; and the places where each tree approaches each other should preferably have sparse branches (or no branches). This is not only to supplement the shortcomings of these trees with poor shapes, but it is also in line with the natural living state of trees. Madam, please observe: No matter where, if several trees are gathered together, the branches and leaves on the outer periphery are very lush, but the branches and leaves at the places where the trees meet are often very undeveloped. Also, a tallest tree, with its treetop making a certain degree, the other trees will definitely match its angle and live next to it. This is very wonderful. A group of trees is like a group of human beings. In a group of people, a tycoon emerges, and the rest of the people obey this tycoon. Trees can actually do this as well.</p>
<p>Please tell your father to do it according to this method. Not only will it cost limited, but the scene that is formed may be more beautiful than the old tree that died eight or nine years ago.</p>
<h3>Shameless</h3>
<p>— Qin Chen</p>
<p>One evening, Yi Qiu and Zhu Jun inadvertently walked past that small street near the East New Bridge that was filled with girls selling human flesh; at that time, Yi Qiu opened her mouth first:</p>
<p>"What does this mean? Perfectly good people willingly do such dirty things. Don't they even understand shame?" As she spoke, she was looking at a prostitute who was using all her strength to drag a young worker into a small alley with an extremely contemptuous look in her eyes.</p>
<p>Zhu Jun's opinion was completely different from hers. There was no contempt in her eyes, only a sense of pity.</p>
<p>"I don't think so!" She sighed with emotion. "Don't you see that they are just like us, with faces, limbs, able to walk, and able to speak? At first, they may not have known shame, and they also absolutely hated it like you, but life pressed down on them heavily. They have lost all freedom and can only bow their heads and barely eke out their last breath."</p>
<p>"Then why must they live? Isn't it better to seek death early with this kind of life!" Yi Qiu seemed extremely indignant. When she finished walking through that small street and was about to reach the corner, she still turned her head back and glared.</p>
<p>"Death? It's not necessarily easy!..."</p>
<p>Before Zhu Jun could finish speaking, Yi Qiu interrupted her.</p>
<p>"Jumping into the river, hanging, taking medicine, there are many ways, what's so difficult about dying?"</p>
<p>"You can't say it that way! If they want to die themselves, others won't let them die! For example, their pimps will be the first to not allow them to die! Furthermore, their parents, brothers, or husbands and other relatives are often the direct reasons for preventing them from seeking death, or the indirect reasons that make them unable to die." Zhu Jun was not older than Yi Qiu, but she had a special skill in observing worldly affairs, and she estimated the environment of even the lowest prostitutes very clearly. "And although they are very bitter now, they all still hope that there will be a day when they will be able to get ahead in the future, so they themselves are not willing to die, and they are willing to endure."</p>
<p>"This kind of endurance is shameless!" Yi Qiu still couldn't understand.</p>
<p>"No, definitely not!" Zhu Jun immediately retorted her. "Because they didn't originally intend to engage in this kind of business, so their current endurance is not shameless!"</p>
<p>The two people's opinions fundamentally clashed, and it was difficult to talk anymore, so they both walked silently; later, Zhu Jun suddenly thought of something else.</p>
<p>"Qiu, I'll give you a counter-argument! Do you think that Liu Ying, that sophomore in the law department, is shameless?"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" Yi Qiu obviously felt very surprised.</p>
<p>"I said that she doesn't lack food or clothing, just because she likes to show off, she willingly mixes with many male classmates; and in order to get a few more points, she constantly goes to the movies with that pockmarked professor." Zhu Jun used her heel to slam a brick in the cement. "I think she's much more shameless than those prostitutes!"</p>
<p>With this counter-example, Yi Qiu was completely convinced, and a kind of extremely contemptuous expression appeared on her face for the second time.</p>
<h3>Utilization of Discarded Tea Leaves</h3>
<p>— (Zhan Tianxian)</p>
<p>Tea is one of the seven necessities of life, and it is essential for people. Many people are very particular about drinking tea. There is no need for me to mention things like Green Armor, Red Robe, Cloud Mist, Dragon Well, and so on... so many names. As for what kind of taste each one has and how good it is, I don't drink tea very much, so I don't know much about this, so I won't talk about it. However, people treat the leftover tea leaves from brewing as useless and discard them casually. Little do they know that they have many uses. Now, according to what I know, I will write them down below:</p>
<p>1. Pour the leftover tea leaves into a jar, add water, and use this water to water plants every day, which can help them grow.</p>
<p>2. People suffering from eye diseases often have their eyes sealed shut after sleeping and cannot open them. Use the leftover tea leaves to rinse them with hot water, which is more effective than plain water.</p>
<p>3. Applying leftover tea leaves to sores and broken skin has the function of not sticking, absorbing water, and promoting the growth of new flesh.</p>
<p>4. Using leftover tea leaves to wash greasy pots, bowls, tables, cups, chopsticks, and other items makes them exceptionally clean.</p>
<p>5. Dry the leftover tea leaves in the sun, crush them, store them, and use them as kindling in small stoves in the winter, which lasts a very long time.</p>
<p>6. Dry the leftover tea leaves in the sun, put them in a pillowcase, and pillow your head with them, which is not only soft, but is also said to clear heat.</p>
<p>7. Dry tea leaf scraps can drive away moisture. Sprinkle some in a place with moisture today, and the moisture will disappear tomorrow.</p>
<p>8. Wrap dry tea leaf scraps in paper, light them, and use them to drive away flies during the day and mosquitoes at night.</p>
<p>Even a little bit of discarded tea leaves has so many uses. No wonder the ancients said that bamboo roots and wood shavings are all useful. Therefore, the saying "waste utilization" can be proved especially reasonable.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Wife</h3>
<p>— Yi Fa</p>
<p>Everyone knows about the modern great man Mussolini. However, very little is known about his wife. Some people are also rumored to be living separately because divorce is not allowed in Italy. Moreover, the fact that she has already given birth to their fourth and fifth children proves their affection.</p>
<p>Mussolini has never appeared with his wife at public gatherings. Among the kings, nobles, diplomats and officials of various countries who met with Mussolini, there are absolutely few who have been able to meet Mrs. Rachele. When Mussolini uses his own name to hold banquets in hotels, she is not seen standing side by side with Mussolini to greet guests. Mussolini said in his autobiography: "I belong to the public, and what belongs to the public does not belong to any individual."</p>
<p>In various magazines around the world today, photos of Mussolini are everywhere, but photos of this wife are not easy to find. Because Italian women are definitely not the same as British, American, French, and German women. They try their best to avoid things that hinder their husbands. She of course loves Mussolini very much, and quietly undertakes the education of the children at home.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rachele is of humble origin, just like Mussolini. She is from Forlì in northern Italy. She lost her father early and was raised by her mother, Anna. When she was five years old, she helped with drawing water, sweeping, and raising livestock. She only read for two years, from the age of six to eight. Later, she worked as a servant. After Mussolini seized power, she still often went to the countryside to visit old friends.</p>
<p>In 1905, Mussolini's father opened a tavern on Forlì Street, receiving travelers and passers-by. Anna managed the dishes, and Rachele also helped by the side. At that time, Mussolini was expelled from Switzerland and returned to Italy due to his political activities. He and several socialist youths spent their days in the tavern, expounding his arguments. Thus, the seventeen-year-old Rachele and the twenty-four-year-old Mussolini fell in love.</p>
<p>The following year, Mussolini was expelled from Austria again and lived at Rachele's house in Forlì. In 1911, they lived in Milan. Mussolini was a newspaper editor with a monthly salary of one hundred yuan. The couple and their eldest daughter, Edda, lived in Milan for ten years. During this period, Mussolini was imprisoned twice and went to the front line for a year. After marching on Rome and seizing power, he never returned to Milan. When Mussolini was forming his cabinet, his wife was still living in a Milan apartment, handling household affairs and being a loyal Italian housewife. Their two sons, who were studying in school, were the young aviation officers Albino and Vittorio during the invasion of Abyssinia last year. Later, Mr. and Mrs. Mussolini had two more children.</p>
<p>Mussolini was awarded Italy's highest medal, and his wife was called by the honorific title of "Donna." The recipient of this medal is qualified to be a brother to the king. If Mrs. Rachele liked socializing, then even if Mussolini did not have this merit, she could freely enter and exit social circles, but this was not to the liking of the lady.</p>
<p>There had been rumors about Mussolini and famous women in the world. In 1926, Mussolini was almost assassinated in Bologna. At that time, Mussolini urgently sought a safe place to live and returned to his wife's side. Although she does not have much profound knowledge, she has a good understanding of Mussolini's words, deeds, and thoughts. Mussolini's father had warned Rachele before their marriage: "You don't have to think about my son's affairs, this kind of thing is like throwing yourself on the tracks. If you marry him, you will have no happiness or peace." But she did not accept this advice and married Mussolini.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rachele, who now lives in Villa Torlonia in Rome, is so harmonious and happy, although Mussolini is definitely not a husband who likes to flatter women. According to Mussolini's autobiography, it can be known that Mussolini not only belongs to Mrs. Rachele, but also belongs to the emerging Italy.</p>

<h3>Ugaki Makes Final Effort to Form Cabinet</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>The Japanese Hirota Cabinet, after the February 26th Incident, received the imperial order to form a cabinet. After several rounds of discussions and deliberations, the cabinet was finally formed. However, it is difficult to please both sides. The Hirota Cabinet eventually collapsed due to differing opinions between the army and navy. Hirota was in office for less than a year, and he had to resign to apologize to the world because of the mess of events and conflicting intentions.</p>
<p>After Hirota's departure, the task of forming a cabinet fell on General Ugaki. Ugaki once served as the Governor-General of Korea and had a high reputation. He is also an old senior of the army faction, so it was generally speculated that there would be no problem for him to form a cabinet; who knew that things would turn out unexpectedly. The army's attitude was strong, the navy's mediation failed, and to this day, Ugaki has not yet expressed his intention to give up forming a cabinet. Making a final effort, but without making even minimal progress, Ugaki's cabinet formation, looking at the current situation, will undoubtedly end in failure.</p>
<p>In short, the current political situation in Japan, the struggle between the political parties and the military, has reached its final stage. Either the political parties surrender to the military, or the military surrenders to the political parties. The current situation of confrontation between the two sides is extremely serious. Not only can Ugaki's cabinet not proceed smoothly, but anyone else will also find it difficult to organize. Judging from the situation of the two sides, the camp of those with guns is very strong, and the situation of those without guns is also quite strong. It is difficult to solve this problem without going through an extremely serious situation and sacrifice.</p>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers yesterday, General Ugaki entered the palace this morning to meet with Minister of the Interior Yuasa to discuss opening the difficult door to cabinet formation. When he returned to his private residence, three uninvited guests followed him in, damaging one of Ugaki's silk high hats, demanding that Ugaki withdraw in the face of difficulty, with no intention of causing harm. Judging from this, Ugaki can rest. The meaning is that if Ugaki refuses to retreat this time and insists on doing it, there may be other or second-step unfortunate events. What kind of people advocate this, and what kind of people are standing behind it, does not require guessing to see it clearly.</p>
<h3>The Yearning for the Sea</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>Gorky said, "Children are the flowers of the world." When I use this sentence to measure my childhood, I often feel that I am a flower like thousands of other children, trampled on and never fully blossomed. In my childhood, although my family was against weakness, cowardice, and compromise, they did not allow me to develop bravely. They themselves compromised with society, wanting me to be an ordinary person with a comfortable life, wanting me to blossom into a flower that was neither too fat nor too thin. This was the kind of soil they prepared for me. Thus, I was cruelly trampled on.</p>
<p>However, I am a person. I can move, I can choose a life that suits me, an environment that can nurture me into a rebel.</p>
<p>I have lived in this environment for a long time, and those trampled-on characteristics, like the lines written by a young Jewish poet:</p>
<p>"Killed without sin,</p>
<p>Truth brings him back to life!..."</p>
<p>Have all regained life in this soil.</p>
<p>I am like a tiger locked in a cage, relearning all my skills. I am like a petrel soaring out of the dense fog of the valley...</p>
<p>I yearn to see the sea, the sea that leaps in poetry and prose. I yearn even more for the life of the petrel that prophesies the coming of storms on its breast. However, I have no chance to sail, and I have never even seen the coast. Every time I hear my friends' fiery narrations, my heart is intoxicated by them.</p>
<p>I have a young friend who is now a naval student. Their warship is stationed in the waters near Fujian. Every time I correspond with him, I always hope he can tell me about the ocean he sees every day: how the waves turn, how they hit the ship Tung-Tung, how quiet it is when the tide recedes, and whether the beauty of the beach is like the skin of a plump girl, how the sun embroiders colorful clouds in the east...</p>
<p>But he can never answer me fully. He can only say very conceptually: the sea rises and falls like human emotions, heroic, calm...</p>
<p>I think: go see the sea, find an opportunity, go to Wusong, isn't it very convenient? There are undulating waves there! Very close, doesn't cost much money...</p>
<p>"But there is no great sea there," a friend said, "the water there is turbid and not majestic; seeing it will disappoint you, so keep yearning!"</p>
<p>Once, I went with a workers' theater troupe to a school not far from Wusong to perform. When the play ended at one o'clock at night, we stayed in the student dormitory. The host told us: "Get up early tomorrow morning and go to the beach to play, you can see the sunrise!"</p>
<p>I was the happiest first, although I knew: the sea in Wusong is not great and majestic, but I also knew: there are all kinds of seas, just like the soil of the living environment cultivates all kinds of different people and flowers, like me, a yearner for the sea, a petrel just breaking through the dense fog and flying towards the sea, seeing the sea, no matter what kind it is, should be good, right? --There were also a few people who had never seen the sea, and they thought the same way.</p>
<p>The next day, the morning stars were still shining, the blades of grass were still hanging with dew, we braved the autumn wind and ran out of the dormitory.</p>
<p>However, we couldn't find the host, and we didn't know how to get there. We were very disappointed. We waited until we were about to return to Shanghai before the host came back.</p>
<p>The boat moved forward in the Huangpu River. The sun had already come out, but it was cloudy, cold, and dark. Several people sang songs, their facial skin looking a little tight.</p>
<p>My eyes looked at the river water, which was yellow, the tide rolled forward, as if tightly wrapping a roll of sand and rolling forward, impacting the ships and the riverbanks,发出愤怒的吼叫呐喊。 A wave was repelled, shattered, and submerged in the water, then another rushed up, as if it would never stop, unless the enemy retreated...</p>
<p>I looked at the river water flowing down from upstream, which was full of waves. Especially when the sun opened its eyes, the tide in the heart of the river was plated with a thick layer of gold, like steel...</p>
<h3>Pressed Under the Mountain</h3>
<p>— Surrender</p>
<p>There is a passage in "Journey to the West": Sun Wukong was pressed under the mountain by the Buddha, and he could no longer make trouble in the heavenly palace! It can be seen that "mountain" is the most powerful. We also have a saying: "Mount Tai stone dares to stand."</p>
<p>If a person suffers from spermatorrhea, the gonorrhea bacteria make trouble in the human body, causing the person to feel extremely painful. If inferior medicine is taken by mistake, not only will the gonorrhea bacteria not be overcome, but the opportunity for treatment will be missed!</p>
<p>Only the new gonorrhea treatment drug "Deli Ping" can directly reach the lesion and completely eliminate the gonorrhea bacteria. Whether it is new or old gonorrhea, it can be cured quickly. It does not contain ingredients that irritate the kidneys or hinder digestion. The effect is indeed effective and there are no side effects.</p>
<p>Therefore, "Deli Ping" has great pressure, which can kill the gonorrhea bacteria and cut off its harm, so that patients can jump out of the devil's net and step into the bright road.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>After being tempered, it becomes more solid, bright, and powerful... One hand clung to the railing of the boat, and the other hand stroked the slanting iron tow rope. I listened to the whistling of the river water, singing in my mouth, as if my hand was composing a song for it.</p>
<p>The water flows eastward, towards the sea. Everyone who supports the truth is like a grain of iron powder, running towards the magnet. The river water ran to the sea...</p>
<p>When will I be able to see the sea? He has a full and broad chest, he has strong arms, he has a loud singing voice, but when will he use his strong arms to embrace us in his chest and sing songs celebrating victory for us?</p>
<p>Like the river water, flow eastward, petrels yearning for the sea, rushing out of the foggy valley, calling for the victory of the battle...</p>
<h3>Beard</h3>
<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>I have recently developed a habit, which may be a very bad habit. But in middle age, although there is no obvious aging, I can never push the days back and not change my life in my youth at all. Especially for someone as silent and unsociable as me, who was already praised as having an "adult look" in childhood. In middle age, I really feel like I have lived too long. The troubles of life have honed away my lively spirit, and I only feel that I am too old. The formation of that habit is probably not without relationship. That habit is to like to be silent alone, using my fingers to stroke the beard under my chin. That beard, because it was shaved with a safety razor every day for a while, has now become hard and rough. It stings my fingers slightly. But in that slight pain, I feel a kind of inexplicable pleasure and satisfaction.</p>
<p>That habit was developed after coming here to be a teacher to the children. Speaking of which, half of it is due to him, that is, the safety razor was suddenly lost, and there is no such consumable item for sale here. To shave, you have to go to the barber shop. The barber shops here are as simple as they can be, and the barber's skills are so clumsy that cutting a "Western-style haircut" is a very difficult task in their eyes. I remember the first time I went to get a haircut, when they saw it was a "Western-style haircut", they specially asked a barber they called "old master" to take on this task, but I would rather sacrifice my "Western-style haircut" and finally came out with my head shaved. So, who would be willing to endure that "punishment of God" just to get a shave?</p>
<p>So, let those stiff beards grow under my chin, and unconsciously developed this habit.</p>
<p>Sure enough, having a beard makes one look a bit older. It is said that a teacher of children should have that kind of majesty. None of the teachers here are younger than me. There are three who officially keep beards. Unlike me, who is too lazy to get a haircut and let them spread around my mouth like thatch, the mouth corners above the lips are cut into very beautiful figure-eight shapes, and the chin is also very neat. When stroking it with the index finger and thumb, it is indeed awe-inspiring.</p>
<p>Those majestic teachers also suggested to me that instead of letting it grow in such a mess, it is better to officially grow a beard and keep it in a style. Afterwards, just use small scissors to trim it slightly, and you can always maintain that state. Perhaps I am really old. After listening to their proposal, I really wanted to officially grow a beard. Indeed, it would be less trouble, but wouldn't it be better to be more majestic? After discussing it with myself several times, I decided to grow a beard. Although there are no good barbers here, there are several experts in trimming beards.</p>
<p>On the third day of growing my beard, I was accidentally happy and went to the playground to watch the students play with a ball after school. One child was sitting in the corner of the wall crying. That was a common thing. The children simply wouldn't hesitate to cry for a game of ball. So I majestically found a slightly older child and asked him. He didn't know. I found a second one, but he still didn't know. There was no way. I picked up the child, coaxed him not to cry, and asked him who bullied him. The child looked at my face, cried even harder, stubbornly squatted down, and ran away, ran so fast.</p>
<p>Later, another child told me the reason he ran away: he was afraid of my beard, saying that it was like the Earth God and must not be a good person. This made me understand why none of the children went to play in the rooms of my three bearded colleagues.</p>
<p>Now I regret it. Children don't like old people. I should be young, not even looking like an "adult". I want every child to like me, just like I like them.</p>
<p>Youth is precious!</p>

<p>Opening chapter "Pipa Ji Shuguan"</p>
<p>Thinking of relatives is always sad. Cai Bojie sits alone in the study. Thinking of my parents teaching me to study diligently. Now. Essays have harmed my parents. Bored, I watch the books. Who knows, it stirs up sorrow. Leaving the seat, I watch the landscape painting on the wall. Seeing the image, my heart is secretly hurt. The painting resembles my parents. Could it be. Saint Yang Huo is generally fat. Immediately ask my wife. I don't know why it's hung in the study. Husband, if you want to know the meaning of the painting. Read the inscription carefully. Replying sentence by sentence. Watching, it suits my mind. The wife starts to call sister. Please invite Wu Niang out of the inner hall. Why are you wearing plain clothes? How did you come to the imperial state alone? Husband, since we parted, we encountered famine. Parents-in-law died one after another. Hearing a word. Tears in both lines. Crying sadly, Cai Zhonglang. Hanging the crown and untying the blue robe. Resigning and submitting a memorial to bid farewell to the king. Practicing filial piety and returning to my hometown together.</p>

<p>Zhongxi (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening chapter "Hairpin Phoenix"</p>
<p>Passionate but always foolish. Unfortunate beauty has been said since ancient times. I, Huixian, lost my parents in childhood and had no support. Lonely adopted daughter-in-law to the Lu family. The betrothal of cousins ​​was originally righteous. The family happily spent their time. Even more happy that my cousin's feelings are also deep. Murmuring small words warm words. I only hate, the nun Bukong is greedy for alms. I only regret, I politely dissuaded and gave her to the deep enemy. The hairpin Phoenix, is it intentional to fall apart? Causing extraordinary disasters. Instigation is nothing but revenge. The world can kill the nun. Slander entered the mother and harmed the slave. Suffering all kinds of hardships and carrying the burden. The mother-in-law's anger did not subside and her heart changed even more. She actually made me, alone in the empty door, suffer bullying. The evil nun once lured me into a lowly profession. To guard my chastity, I vowed not to obey. How did my good man know that he went to the exam far away? A thousand kinds of sorrow, who can I confide in? Although my husband returned and saw me. Even more sad. The lotus flowers are hard to form. Alas. How can I bear to read the broken intestines? Alas, tears wet the silk kerchief drop by drop. Alas, thinking about the past and the future, it is difficult to fall asleep. Alas, tossing and turning all night, I can't sleep peacefully. Alas, my haggard face is afraid to face the mirror. Alas, I have become ill from lying in bed. Alas, the Kun string should be continued and reminded again. Alas, the mother-in-law called me after I died and recovered. I can't greet you in the morning and evening. I would like to unfold my frowning eyebrows for the time being. You must forgive my unfilial name. I sigh that my karmic relationship was determined in my previous life. Why bother to blame others for the torment? I only hope that heaven knows my intentions. Life 　 Gatherings and separations are originally floating. I am willing to close my eyes and go to the underworld.</p>

<h3>"New Life Song"</h3>
<p>One of the songs in "New Year's Money"</p>
<p>There are seven songs interspersed in the upcoming Mingxing film "New Year's Money": Hu Rongrong sings "New Year's Money", "Bird in a Cage", Gong Qiuxia sings "Happy New Year", "Volcanic Landscape", Li Minghui sings "Dance Hall Song", Yao Ping sings "New Year Song", Li Lilian sings "New Life Song". These singers are all good at singing, and they have achieved good results in assisting the atmosphere of the development of the whole play.</p>
<p>Among the seven songs, the first six are of the "decadent music" type. The last "New Life Song" by Li Lilian is a majestic and inspiring patriotic song. She leads a group of innocent elementary school students to sing loudly, and the sound waves spread to everyone's eardrums, which can't help but arouse a patriotic upsurge and echo the singing loudly. - This symbolizes that the Chinese nation has awakened from the drunken dream of "decadent music" and created a new life.</p>
<p>The author of "New Life Song" is He Luting. The lyrics are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>"Here there is new life - the passion of fire, here there is the will to live - the spirit of battle. Here there is the edge of a sword, there is the sound of iron, here there are free people, there is a solid Great Wall. Here there is resonance, there is unity, here there is your infinite future, there is my guiding light, here there is progress, here there is no decline, here there is progress, no decline!"</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Art World</h3>
<p>The Literary and Film Company's "Rumors are Terrible" will be screened at the Shanghai Grand Theater on North Sichuan Road at 10:00 AM tomorrow.</p>
<p>Since the Torch Theater Troupe of this city performed the national defense plays "Smuggling" and "Our Hometown" at the Penglai Grand Theater in the South City on the 32nd, theaters in various places - such as Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Xiamen, etc., have sent letters or sent personnel to strongly invite the troupe to perform in various places. The board of directors decided yesterday to go to Zhenjiang first. The repertoire includes "Our Hometown", "Female Reporter", and "Children Without a Motherland". However, a few members of the troupe are unable to spare time due to their duties. From now on, more than a dozen young people with aspirations in theatrical arts will be recruited. You can first send a letter to register, with a photo attached. Address: Zhang Yijun c/o Jina Film Company, No. 610 Ouyang Road, Hongkou.</p>
<p>The actors who participated in the performance of "Sunrise" by the "Drama Workshop" this time include the four ladies Feng Zi, Kang Zhang, Su Ling, and Yan Qun, as well as Ding Boliu, Hong Mo, Li Xianjing, Cui Shiji, Wu Tieyi, Gongsun Min, Shen Chongjiao, etc. They are all the backbones of many theater troupes in various universities, and they have rich stage experience.</p>
<h3>Bai Lu and Han Lagen "A Match Made in Heaven"</h3>
<h3>Xinhua News</h3>
<p>Diao Banhua was very excited about starring in "Night Rain in Xiaoxiang". The plot of the play is tortuous. Diao Banhua cried a lot today and laughed wildly tomorrow. She has been filming for days and is moody. Diao said that filming is very funny.</p>
<p>"Song at Midnight" is in a hurry to end. Jin Youwei said that if this film continues to be filmed, his face will be broken. Every time he films, he must put on makeup as a weirdo, and after filming, he must wash his face with Geslin, which is really not easy to enjoy.</p>
<p>"Youth March" has already started auspiciously. Shi Dongyou has put in unprecedented effort for this play. After receiving the script, the heroine Hu Ping studied it at home for a week, declined all social engagements, and did not leave the house. At the same time, all parties attached great importance to "Youth March".</p>
<p>"Soaring Ambition" is scheduled to be shown on New Year's Day at the Capital Grand Theater in Nanjing and the Central and South City Theaters in Shanghai. In Nanjing, national defense films will definitely receive special attention.</p>
<p>Chen Juanjuan participates in "Night Rain in Xiaoxiang", playing the daughter of Diao Banhua Jin You, and has an important performance.</p>
<h3>"Living in Drunkenness and Death" Opens Today</h3>
<p>The last program of the third public performance of amateur actors, "Living in Drunkenness and Death", will be staged today. This play is adapted and directed by Shen Xiling and Song Zi. The story is very realistic. It stars Yuan Muzhi, Zhao Dan, Shi Chao, Gu Erdao, Lan Ping, Li Qing, Wu Mei, Lü Ban, Li Lin, etc. The date is hasty, and it will only be performed for two days. In order to avoid the audience from being disappointed, an additional performance will be added every day at 5:30, it is said.</p>
