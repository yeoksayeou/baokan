<h3>九國公約會議今晨開幕英外相聲明决與美合作</h3>
<p>具有保護利益履行國際義務决心　財相西門亦謂中國領土不可侵犯</p>
<p>［倫敦］外相艾登今日在下院演說、答復反對黨攻擊政府關於國聯及遠東政策、艾登稱、“關於遠東爭執無論採取何種行動、端賴美國之完全合作、余今日可毫無疑義而言者、倘在平等基礎上、取得美國之合作、而召集國際會議則余不僅願自日內瓦赴白魯塞爾、卽自澳洲墨爾鉢而至阿拉斯加、亦决不辭其勞苦、在國際局勢現狀之下、余尤抱此决心、”外相復稱、凡攻擊政府者、均因其未能了解美國在日內瓦之地位、實與其在白魯塞爾所佔地位不同、艾登復稱、“當然此種不同之點、實至重要、艾登復答復其他抨擊之詞、謂“外交秘密、雖有未便洩露之處、但在現有事件之中、余應明白聲明、召集九國公約會議之發起者、並非英國、而為美國政府、”艾登繼再陳述某反對黨領袖之言、謂最近曾表示願與美國合作之熱望、並曾切實訽問、“在此危險而困難的遠東時局之中、倘英國不能如美國之邁步前進、而與美國完全和恊、英國能否於不超越美國之外、至少須能追隨左右而不被遺棄過遠、艾登稱、“余今完全接受此界說、以為今後之方針、”</p>
<p>關於國聯問題艾登謂、彼不能不顧及國聯目前荏弱所發生之實質上困難、亦不願辯論其咎之何屬、現世界强國共七、而為國聯會員者僅三、如此、吾人何能言、倘汝誠實信賴國聯、則國聯無上之勢力將為汝之後盾、關於此點、抱憾之深者、實莫于艾登本人云、“倘各國不能一致接受國際公法之束縛、如吾人所已接受者、則在反對有實力之侵略者之勢力、尚未至所向無敵之時、吾人實無永久和平可言、”</p>
<p>艾登復稱、英國雖願討論任何國家之困難但亦决不為現正方興未艾之兇殘、如口稱和平、而實則所宣佈者、不啻哀的美敦書等所懾服、艾登繼將英國外交政策之基礎、作如下之說明、謂“吾人在必要時、雖有保護吾人重大利益及盡吾人國際間義務之决心、但吾人决不採取與國聯盟約或巴黎非戰公約之條文及精神相反之行動、吾人深信爭端之解决、應由和平途徑並願儘量努力、使此種原則、得普遍的接受及遵守、再則、吾人雖承認當今之國聯已受會員國不完全之重大影響、但尚深信國聯猶為獲得效果之最佳途徑、凡有建議改組國聯者、吾人應聆取其意見、但應以確能鞏固國際間信任及使國聯能完成盟約所載之目的者爲限、因此、吾人不應加入反共産及反法西斯之團體、蓋吾人所關切者、端在他國之對外政策、而非他國之內政也、吾人謹以合作給與各國、但不能接受他國之指揮、”</p>
<p>反對黨領袖阿特里少校起而質問曰、“英國政府在九國公約會議席上、是否將以九國公約之原則、卽保障中國領土完整為立場、”財相西門當答曰“然、吾人應如此、”西門復謂“根據九國公約、每個簽字國均已担負不侵犯中國領土之完整、并同意於條約破壞時、應互相磋商、以求解决、此卽白魯塞爾會議所以召集之原因、此種諾言如何運用卽吾人所以參加之目的”云、阿特里復詢政府是否决不與任何侵犯中國完整之國家訂立恊定、或接受任何辦法、西門答稱、彼不願多贅、謂“此為余所能儘量宣佈者、美國所已為者、亦不過如是、在此事件中、吾人與美國實同一立塲”云、（中央社一日路透電）</p>

<p>［倫敦］外相艾登本日午後出席下議院發表演說之後卽往比京、出席九國公約會議、海外自治領大臣馬爾康麥唐納•外務部帮辦買德幹爵士二人、亦與外相同行（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　外交部長斯巴克頃於午前十一時接見出席九國公約會議中國首席代表顧維鈞及其他中國代表團人員、又英國外相艾登、來此間出席九國公約會議、已於今晨抵此、外長斯巴克親赴車站迎迓、（中央社二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［羅馬］意代表團已於昨晚起程赴比京、首席代表為前任駐德大使與李頓調査團代表馬里斯哥蒂、（二日國民海通電）</p>
<p>葡京　葡政府頃任命駐比公使嘉斯德洛為首席代表、出席九國會議、而以駐美公使比陽基副之、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［莫斯科］消息靈通人士頃宣稱、蘇聯出席九國公約會議代表團將重行提出民主國家結成聯合戰綫、以反對侵略國之理論、則以此種理論、實與各民主國家國內人民戰綫之策略、相輔而行、但蘇聯代表團將避免單獨提出此項理論、蓋美國羅斯福總統與國務卿赫爾雖曾先後發表宣言、主張民主國家聯合行動、然就九國公約會議之實際結果而論、則仍未能十分信任也、此外、政界人士對於遠東一般局勢、頗表示樂觀、以為自中日衝突發生之後、日本軍隊因欲擊破中國抵抗力量、開往中國加入戰局者、日漸增多、因之蘇聯與“滿州國”邊境爭執、蘇聯與日“滿”邊界守兵衝突、前雖層出不窮、今已絕無所聞、日本並已放棄單方面勘定蘇“滿”邊界之企圖、表示對於蘇聯邊界、已不欲再施以壓迫、至於外間盛傳、蘇聯政府擬廢除蘇聯與外蒙古所訂結之互助公約、俾外蒙古可以軍火及其他物品供給中國、而與蘇聯無涉、對於此積謠傳、此間負責人士、加以堅决否認、謂為荒誕無稽、並稱此種荒謬之傳說、實屬屢見不鮮、例如蘇聯與德國之關係、每况愈下、而外間謠傳則謂、蘇聯謀與德國接近、如是者不一而足、總之、此種造謠、其目的無非在於動搖蘇聯友人對於蘇聯之信任心理而已云、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於九國公約會議事、負責方面宣稱、英國代表團務當覓求一種“方式”、俾在中日兩國之間、設法調處、但英國政界人士以為、中國僅能接受光榮的和平、日本則將拒不照辦、以故調處工作、恐徒勞而無功、又意德日三國反共恊定談判、業已成功、即當舉行簽字、因此意國將在九國公約會議中、支持日本之見解、此外、政界人士又謂、九國公約會議將討論各國在華利益之保障問題、美國代表團　將提出各國領土凡鄰近中日兩國者之保護問題、英國態度乃與美國亦步亦趨、惟美是否提出切實建議、以解决中日兩國爭端、或使各國在華利益曁在中國附近所有領土之安全勿受影響、則英國政界人士所急欲知悉者也、現悉外相艾登在比京僅將勾留數日、即行返國、而由海外自治領大臣馬永康麥唐納代任首席代表云、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意將加入德日反共恊定</h3>

<p>［柏林］關於德意兩國有默契在某種情勢中、彼此以兵力相助一說、昨夜官塲予以否認、謂現可切實聲明者、德國對意並無軍事盟約云（中央社二日路透電）</p>
<h3>倫敦泰晤士報說明白魯塞爾會議之意義</h3>
<p>關係各國共同行動恢復和平　英美聯合陣綫現已牢不可破倫敦</p>
<p>［倫敦］泰晤士報今日評論稱“倘遠東方面之理智、有早日回復之望、則東西雙方均須切實了解白魯塞爾會議之為何物、蓋白魯塞爾會議者、並非賦有膺懲權力之法庭、不過爲若干負責各國之集會、其中若干國家、對於遠東之生命、極為關切不得不聚集討論、究應採取何種共同之外交行動、始可促成和平之恢復耳、該報復稱、中國境內發生戰事確在九國公約範圍之內、故國聯大會特採取適合實際之辦法、使該約各簽字國家、自行集議、籌劃應付方法、故國聯方面絕無干涉之嫌疑、如日本政府所用以蒙蔽其國內之民衆者、再則、美總統在芝加哥之演說、已使國聯主張之重要性及其議程之範疇、益見增加、但對於原有之用意、則並未加以變易、羅斯福總統之言論、已將其目標明白指出、毫無疑義並與英國主張、完全脗合無間、故美國出席白魯塞爾會議、實為具有無上價值之事實、而此後會議進行中、無論在何時期、其採取之行動、亦必能獲得英方代表及其政府、與後方民衆、完全響應、實已定為不移之南針、蓋此節英美之聯合陣綫、不為任何疑慮顧忌所損害及阻撓者也、西方各國亦正如日本、深覺遠東之安定、端賴有關係之兩國、能有正常之關係、至於無意義之敵視、不論其出之於此方或彼方、欺凌或蔑視中國人民、認之爲政治上之劣等民族、祇配受傀儡政府之奴隸待遇者、均不足以言安定、而日本暴露於中國必然之抗戰、以及此種戰爭在調停失敗後所將造成之財政枯竭、實無保障之望云、（中央社二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］泰晤士報頃以譏笑之辭、評論遠東問題、略謂、日本以推行“自衛”政策為口實、而遂其擴張領土之謀、業以朝鮮邊界為出發點、而侵入蒙古•西伯利亞、行將及於中國黃河、“九國公約會議目標所在、乃欲用和平方式、促使中日兩國戰爭得以早日結束、於此有一淺近事實、、亟須加以注意者、卽日本行動、業已引起條約義務實踐問題、關係各國、因惟持和平起見、業在某區域內、并在某種範圍之內、邀請美國合作、美國亦已接受之、因而中日爭端已成為國際重大問題、今後九國公約會議若果失敗、則必產生一種新局勢、爲吾人所亟須應付者、此在外相艾登已於日前加以道破、凡屬東亞西歐各國政治家、務當有以避免之也”云（中央社二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英日齜齬益甚</h3>
<p>大公司股東擬自動排貨　日又為砲擊英兵案道歉</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於上月廿九日晚間上海英國士兵三名被日本砲彈擊斃一案、此間日本大使館原曾聲明日軍當時並未開砲、頃又發表公報稱、按之調査結果、各該士兵確被日本砲彈所擊斃、日軍當局業已採取適當措置、以免類似情事再度發生、日本政府對於死者家屬、並願予以適當賠償云、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於上海日本砲彈擊斃英國兵士三名一事、官方人士頃徵實、日本政府業已正式向英國政府道歉、並允賠償損失、因此一般人認為此項爭端已告結束云、（中央社二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英國駐華大使館航空副武官馬瑞諸人上月十二日在上海附近被日本飛機射擊一事、下議院本日開會時、保守黨議員阿斯托曾詢問外相艾登、日本政府對於英國所提出之抗議、曾否加以答覆、外相當宣稱、“日本政府曾以照會一件送達英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士、告以調査所得之結果、表示歉意、並聲明當採取適當措置、以懲辦責任者、英國政府接獲此項照會之後、當卽訓令克萊琪大使、着其通知日本政府、謂英國政府認為此案等已結束、但日本政府關於懲辦各該責任者所採取之措置、應請隨時通知英國政府云、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］按之東京方面消息、日本一部份議員日昨開會、議决英國對於遠東問題、倘不變更現行態度、則日本即當决定嚴重手段、以資對付、此訊傳來、英國人士頗為震動、嗣悉所謂嚴重手段、僅指在精神與道德上、與英國斷絕關係而言、不安心理乃為之稍舒、目前英國金融界人士、對於李滋羅斯爵士襄助中國財政復興所獲成就、亟願有以保全云、並以爲上海英國防車士兵、時被日本砲彈擊斃、結果所屆、英國方面或當發生一動反響、其强硬程度較之九國公約會議所可通過之精神上裁决、當有過之而無不及、此外、英國境內抵制日本貨物運動、曾因政府反對之故、一度歸於緩和、現則英國人士頗多以個別行動之形式、倡導抵貨運動者、據悉、某某大公司多數股東、擬在本年年底各該公司舉行股東大會時、建議與日本停止交易、尤其是各大煤油公司將採取此項辦法、而停止以煤油供給日本、果爾、日本燃料取給、即將成爲問題矣、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［東京］東京朝日新聞今日以喪失平調之英國爲題、發表評論稱、以長江一帶爲其勢力範圍之英國、此次竟在上海瞥見大事變之爆發、在英國與其認為可驚、不如謂為不無一面之理、遇事以越軌行動、竭力與中國作抗日上之合作、英國在滬官憲及與駐軍有關者與言論機關、以至商人、均一致妄動、均有事實爲證、蓋此卽英國對日論調以至態度失其平調也、英國對於中日事變、並未得到正常之認識、英國言論為清一色抗日所統制而動員、至於泰晤士報低落品位有如是、其他均可類推、（二日同盟電）</p>
<h3>英下議院否决工黨彈劾案</h3>

<p>［倫敦］英國工黨今日在下院所提出關於國聯問題、中日戰爭、及西班牙問題之譴責政府案、在外相艾登及財相西門等發表動人演說後、已以三百六十三票對一百四十二票否决、該譴責案係由工黨議員馬利遜所動議、內稱、一陛下之顧問大臣等在外交政策、上軟弱無能、依違兩可、及危及永久和平及國家安全、並違反國際聯盟原則、而减損英國之威望、目因其缺乏建設性及根本上之準備、以期人民生活程度、能在適當及永久之基礎上增高、實已失却本院之信任”云、（中央社一日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］下議院日前辯論奏章草案時、反對派各黨議員、對於政府現行外交政策、曾紛紛加以批評、本日午後外相艾登、特在啟程前往比京參加九國公約會議之前、出席下院發表長篇演說、加以答覆、對於中日兩國爭端、德國要求恢復舊有殖民地問題曁西班牙問題均曾有所論列、其關於中日爭端段有云、“反對派各黨議員曾提出質問、謂當此遠東時局分艱危之際、吾人是否與美國通力合作、亦步亦趨雖不求出人頭地、但亦不落人後、茲當答之曰、余對於此項見解、完全予以接受、并即以此爲吾人目標所在、”</p>
<p>關於遠東問題之談判、自日內瓦移至白魯塞爾者、實因美國卽非國聯會會員國、必須在會外舉行會議、該國始得以平等地位、參加其事、蓋以關於遠東爭端任何行動、不論其性質如何、苟欲其發生效力端以美國共同合作、爲其主要條件、（衆鼓掌）、余今毫不遲疑、敢向諸君宣稱、當此時局緊張之際、為使美國得以平等地位、與吾人充分合作、藉以應付國際爭端起見、余非特願在日內瓦與白魯塞爾之、僕僕奔走、即跋涉於澳州墨爾鉢　阿拉斯加半島之間、亦所不霸、”外傳英國政府曾以壓力加諸比國前總理齊蘭、促其召集九國公約會議一說、並非確詞、又選擇比京爲會議地點、此　原係美國政府所發動、至自由黨前首相勞合喬治批評政府、自一九三一年以來、對於遠東爭端所持態度失之消極、實非眞相、一余曾遍査檔案、國聯會方面、固從未有人提議對日實施經濟制裁、其不能獨責英國明矣、以言德國恢復舊有殖民地一項要求、一有某國焉、曾於戰後在歐洲獲有廣大領土、並將原為其同盟國所有之非洲屬地、分得一部份、以爲參戰之酬報、今者、該國對於德國此項要求、輙加以贊助、關於此層、吾人當明白聲明、當某國政府顯未準備捐棄該國所有土地以滿足德國要求時、吾人斷不能承認任何政府、有向吾國要求割讓殖民地之權利（衆鼓掌）、</p>
<p>關於西班牙問題、自由黨前首相勞合喬治曾謂、現行不干涉政策、徒於西國國民軍有利、此說實非盡然、綫西國共和政府在地中海西部之海岸綫頗長、儘可自他國、尤其是蘇聯、運入各種貨物與軍火、自尼翁協定成立、地中海上海盜歛跡以來、此種海道運入貸物辦法、益見便利、而蘇聯所製之坦克車飛機、在西國內戰中極爲得力、則尤爲盡人所知之事、以言交戰團體承認問題過去茍無外國干涉情事、西國國民軍殆早已獲有交戰團體權利、國民軍所屬海軍實力、旣在政府軍之上、一經各國承認其爲交戰團體之後、自必佔有優勢、要之、國民軍在陸地上雖獲有外國人之援助但在海面上、即因此不能獲有交戰團體權利、其所付代價、實甚重大、上至敢謂、關於西國內戰當事雙方、自國外僅得軍火及其他接濟之詳細方法、若果予以揭發、下院諸君、必有爲之驚詫者矣、艾登外相旋又謂、西國國民軍即使擁有最後勝利、該國未來政府、亦未必採取反英政策、“西國內戰、”不問其結果如何、吾人的願與該國樹立友好關係、余深信該國當局、亦必具有同感</p>
<p>至此、艾登外相乃提出結論云、凡有關英國生存之各項利益、吾人决當加以維護、國際會盟約與巴黎非戰公約所規定之各項國際義務、亦當予以履行、國聯會目下難受有若干窒碍、但對於國際爭端、用和平方法予以解决一層、仍可供給最佳之工具、任何建議案、凡是以强化國聯會機構者、均爲英國所歡迎、英國决不參加反共產主議或反法西斯主義集團、吾人願與各國携手合作、但决不聽人顯指氣使、關於遠東問題、吾人務當認識遠東時局之種種困難、余今夜前往比京出席九國公約會議、即以此種精神出之、自當竭盡所能、有所貢獻、此則余在啟行之前、所可爲下院諸君吿者也”云、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國聯募捐資助我國防疫</h3>
<p>工黨議員提出質問　艾登外相解釋誤會</p>
<p>［倫敦］工黨議員史密斯今日曾在下議院詢及英政府對於國聯募捐防止中國發生疫癘政策、外相艾登答稱、十月一日國聯行政院召集會議時、英政府曾贊同請求國聯衛生委員會草擬計劃、以爲中國政府防疫及醫藥救濟之顧問及援助、並贊同以技術合作給與中國、並請求國聯大會增加每年補助金、以期能應付目前特殊環境之需要、以上各項建議、俱已由國聯大會通過、丈登復稱、英政府對於自動捐助之提案、極表同情、但關於捐款之决定、暫加保留、史密斯繼復提出一補充問題、艾登答稱、若謂外部代表及蘇格蘭事務火臣艾立特首先贊成其議者、實屬不確、但事後外部代表曾與日本永久代表晤談、嗣英代表卽奉訓令不再贊助該議、艾登氏謂、“對於國聯增加補助金一節、吾人非但曾加以贊成、且曾投票擁護之、其惟一未告解决之點、卽自動捐款而已、惟吾人之態度至爲明顯、卽他國倘能按其成份捐助、吾人亦必從衆也、史密斯卽稱、“此卽余所欲知者、豈英國不應在此首倡、以團結愛好和平之一切國家乎”、艾登答謂、“在此已有誤會之處、余當時並未親自參加討論、事後聞會議時、並未有具體議案提出、凡已提出之具體議案、吾人已贊成之、吾人之立塲、實至淸楚也、艾登末謂、“吾人已一致贊同增加英國補助金、以期可資應用之款能更充裕、英政府在此已完全盡其本份、而吾人之願與他國合作、以期國際自動捐款之獲有成效、亦甚明白云（中央社一日路透電）</p>

<h3>敵軍又渡蘇州河</h3>
<p>被我包圍痛擊卒未得逞</p>
<p>敵軍急圖達到速戰速决之目的、連日集中兵力於蘇州河北岸、不斷偷渡、冀在南岸覓一立足點、以便大舉進犯、惟三日來每次均爲我殱滅逐退、昨晨敵機活動異常、午後因雨歛跡、惟砲聲全日未停、敵軍續有渡過、但大部已經肅淸、中央社隨軍記者昨晚十時四十五分報吿沿岸戰况如下、</p>
<p>劉家宅敵被我包圍</p>
<p>周家橋宅以西陳家渡方面之敵、二次偷渡爲我擊退後、昨晨十時、敵又施故技、在大砲烟幕之掩護、架建帆布橋、偷渡過河、我軍雖早知敵計、奈以砲火甚密、不得已暫行後退、敵約二百人、蠭擁而至、進佔劉家宅、正圖構築工事時、我軍卽猛烈反攻、搏戰甚久、斃敵無算、至午後三時•敵勢不支、向西潰退、竄入某洋房內、該屋構造堅固、儼似堡壘、敵架槍頑鬥、我軍屢攻不下、乃加以包圍、晚復集中砲火轟擊、當不難全部解决、</p>

<p>朱家橋敵迅予解决</p>
<p>同時在朱家橋•北新涇•周家涇•周家宅等處、亦有敵軍渡過、但均迅卽爲我逐退肅淸、敵軍更以野砲及迫擊砲集中轟擊豐田紗廠、廠房雖有損毁、但我軍在廠附近之工事、則帶、活動異常、並投彈多枚、均落田野間、絕未波及、敵機於昨日上午、在沿蘇州河一帶、活動異常、並投彈多枚、均落田野間、午後因大雨、故敵機旋機卽歛跡、</p>

<p>連日來敵軍屢謀偷渡蘇州河、輒被我軍包圍殱滅、故其傷亡、又趨嚴重、昨日下午一時左右、復續有敵商輪改建之紅十字艦亞美利加丸抵滬、停靠大阪碼頭、當晚運載傷兵六百餘人、凖備於今日駛返日本、又敵商輪改建之第一零六號運輸艦銃波丸一日載敵六次增援軍之第六批三千餘人來滬後、當晚改載敵傷兵約千餘人、於二日午刻左右、駛返日本、</p>

<h3>不可動搖的方針宜</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>比京會議今日開幕了。南北兩戰塲也到了非常緊張的時候。</p>
<p>這幾天。在北戰塲上。敵人把平漢津浦兩綫的主力西移。向太原作猛烈的進攻。在南戰塲上。敵人冒着我軍猛烈的砲火。幾次三番。强渡蘇州河。顯然也要在短期以內。佔領上海的全部。</p>
<p>敵人的用意是很顯然的。趁比京會議討論侵略問題的時候。趕緊抓住我國那兩個主要的軍事中心。向世界的和平勢力示威一下。這才可以等機會提出强盜式的和平條件來。</p>
<p>我們要不上敵人的當。必須把全國力量集中於長期的抗戰。使敵人無論何時。顯不出多大的威勢來。至於外交方面。則只要堅守住原有的立塲。謹愼小心地防範敵人的陰謀就是了。</p>
<p>在目前這重要關頭。我們尤其不能因害怕戰禍的擴大。而存絲毫的僥倖心理。無論如何。抗戰到底的方針是絲毫搖動不得的。</p>

<p>親愛的二千三百萬同胞、目下集中全世界人們的視綫、“尤其是與勝敗有休戚相關的我們朝鮮民族非常關心”的中日戰爭、開始已兩個半月了、在這兩個多月之中、中國方面的犧牲固然多、可是敵人的犧牲也不在少數、近日中國軍隊因大塲失陷、中閘北江灣暫時撤退、敵人好像得到什麽大勝利似的作發狂的宣傳、其實這是不知恥的無聊的行動。因為中國軍隊的退出江灣閘北、是戰略上的手段、與整個戰局毫無影響、却不知因此延長了戰綫、對於敵人反而不利、俄國的每日新報說、此次日軍攻陷大塲、延長戰綫、在戰略上上了中國的當、某英文報的記者也說、因中國軍隊退出閘北•江灣•日軍的戰綫延長、攻擊上比前不利、又以日軍費了七十六日工夫佔領北火車站等話來譏笑敵人的脆弱無謀、可見我們的觀察十分正確、敵人之所以出兩萬多死傷消耗絕大的軍火、拚命的攻擊大塲、是因華北戰况的不利、和蘇滿國境的形勢險惡化、企圖迅速結束上海戰爭、以注專力於華北、可是上海戰爭、非到消滅淨盡來滬敵軍、是不會結束的、憑牠如何作惡、祇能促進自身的滅亡而已、無論如何、中國只要延長時期、能够維持到一年、敵人會自身崩潰是很明顯的事實、照這次戰爭的演進的形勢和敵人內部的紛亂、以及國際形勢等諸般狀態看來、我們可以確信日本帝國主義命運已到盡頭、中國及其他東方弱小民族自由解放的時期到來了、日本帝國主義對中國的野蠻侵略戰爭、使四十年來受强暴壓迫的中國民族忍無可忍、决心用四萬萬五千萬的赤血來洗淨過去一切恥辱、爭取民族國家的獨立生存、整個的中華民族鐵一般的團結、個個都是抱定為國犧牲的决心、視死如歸、勇敢的悲壯的抗戰到底、我們聽得說、這次中國軍隊退出閘北時有兩萬多難民逃進租界、有人說、應該你們早已逃出來、為何還在那火綫中冒險、他們很激昂的答道、我們都逃走了、誰給血戰的將士們帮忙茶飯洗濯等一切雜役呢、這幾句話够使向來瞧不起中國人的一般外人充分了解中華民族的覺醒和偉大、反過來看看敵人的情形是如何呢、他們的民衆是反對侵略戰爭、將士不用命、甚至於敵軍的下級幹部不願出戰而在中途自殺的也頗不少、軍閥政黨互相軋轢、軍閥與軍閥間也意見衝突、宇垠一成被刺、荒木貞夫有被監視之說、這些事實便是在這次戰爭中看出敵人一定滅亡、中國絕對會勝利條件了、這是什麽原因呢、㊀因為這次中日戰爭並不是帝國主義和帝國主義的對立戰爭、而是日帝國主義無止境的侵略、要把華北甚至於整個中國化為其獨佔的殖民地的侵略戰爭、㊁跟着戰爭的延長、敵國經濟涸竭、社會不安、日甚一日、敵國內部的種種矛盾愈尖銳化、有暴發大規模內戰的很大可能、並且日本帝國主義是擁有不少的殖民地、乘這次戰爭的機會、正是朝鮮、台灣、滿洲、各處的反日革命勢力、猛烈抬頭的機會、這種勢力都是足以制日本帝國主義的死命的可怕的威力、㊂這次戰爭日本帝國主義處在侵略者地位的關係、全世界弱小民族和愛護和平的人士極端憎惡日本帝國主義、尤其是利害相關的蘇俄、對於中國予以眞心的同情和協助、這是大家都知道的事實、同時中國根本沒有殖民地、在過去多少政見不合的各黨各派和軍事領袖、也當這個時期、早已拚除一切政見、在沸騰的敵愾心和興奮的民族意識之下、萬衆一心誓死抗爭、中國民族的這種團結力、實非任何力量所能阻碍或分散、中國旣無內顧之憂、又得國際的同情、其勝利自屬無疑、而中國的勝利就是我們的勝利、中華民族復興之日。就是東方弱小民族解放之時、所以凡是受帝國主義壓迫的一切東方弱小民族、應該作有機的連絡、以物力人力種種方面積極援助中國、尤其是直接受日本帝國主義壓迫的我們朝鮮民族、是無論男女老少個個都要以非常的覺悟和决心實行全民族總動員、直接參加戰爭、非和我們的敵人拚命不可、起來吧、同胞們、我們相信凡有朝鮮靈魂的、不願過奴𨽾生活的、在這個時期、决不會躊躇、我們的當面任務是、㊀不論什麽黨什麽派、都要掃除一切政見和黨派觀念、統一在一個旗幟下、集中强化革命力量、當此大敵當前的今日、為了民族國家、還有什麽不能犧牲的呢、㊁一切未組織的羣衆、是一面組織一面訓練、勞動者於工廠、農民於農村、學生於學校、商人於城市、各由各的立塲、盡所有的力量、用暴動•暗殺•破壤等種種手段擾亂敵人的前後方、使敵人腹臟禍起、自行崩潰、最後勝利、自然是屬於我們的、如果在這個時候、還不覺悟、替敵人作倀鬼、或暗通敵人、那就是朝鮮民族的公敵、也是朝鮮民族的恥辱、</p>

<h3>動員全上海的兒童勸募救國儲金</h3>
<p>自從八一三的全面抗戰開始以來，上海青年會就舉行了徵募救國公債運動，目的十萬元，據說在　星斯前己經完滿地達到目的•這次該會又發起勸募教國儲金一萬戶的運動，日期是上月三十一日（星期日）在該會舉行開募禮，全體的組織是分一百隊，每隊都由隊長負責向外勸募，以運到一百戶的月的。照該會的縛織和勸募精神，道一萬戶的目的是不難逹到的。</p>
<p>在運動還沒有開始以前，聽說內部的縛織已經完成，每隊隊長入選早經聘讀定妥，從隊長名單中，我們發現了一位年紀不過九歲的兒童，她的名字呌李鄂聲，當時內為好奇心的驅使，呌我不得不去拜望她一下，看看我們這位小朋友是否能夠來担負起這種勸募的責任。</p>
<p>當我去拜望她的時候，她剛從學校回家，因此我們才能有三十分鐘的談話。</p>
<p>「我的父母對於勸募救國公債是很熱心的，這次因為青年會的會員徵求我們幫忙，所以我的父親要我担任一隊的隊長，」她好像個成人似的開始向我說︰「但是我的能力是很小，恐怕難有顧績，不過為了國家的生存，我也顧不了許多•」</p>
<p>「那麼，你怎樣去徵集救國儲金呢？」</p>
<p>「我們家裏的傭婦和我們親友家裏的傭婦，都可以勸募的，好在是一元一戶，而自以後每月幾角綫都能儲蓄•至於我們的小周舉們又很多，他們都可以參加儲金，更可以帮忙我去徵勸的。」</p>
<p>「你對她們怎樣講？」</p>
<p>「那還不容易，這些錢又不是捐錢，儲款還是我們自已的，我們一方面儲蓄，一方面還可以救國，這理由是再好說不過的。」</p>
<p>「而且」，她繼積地說，「我父親允許每月給我購買儲金，我自己的糖果貨也在內，這一筆錢，將來就是我的教育費。」</p>
<p>「你一個人去勸募麼？力量豈不太小？」</p>
<p>「我一個人去勸募，力量當然是太小，不過我的父親他很帮我的忙，各方去勸募，還有我的小朋友們也能帮我去勸募，我想他們的父母也一定會帮他們的忙，向各方面去勸募的，」</p>
<p>「我想，假使上海的小朋友們，都能為這一件事努力，也許不久的將來，可以普遍到各處，那不是很有效果嗎？這些事就要靠社會的成人來領導我們，將全上海明兒童動員起來，努力的勸募救國儲金．」</p>
<p>從她的言論中，我們可以看出，我們應當動全滬的兒童父母們，希望由這些父母出來領導他們的子女來担任這一件急切的工作，將救國儲金推廣到全中國的上下層的民眾中，連是培養兒童國家意識最好方法，遭是創造新中國的唯一生力軍。</p>

<h3>故都陷落後之形形色色</h3>

<p>七十餘日見聞記</p>
<p>㊁對外交通斷絕</p>
<p>北不為平漢平綏北寗一鐵路綫幅輳之地、蘆濟橋事件發生後、平漢線首即中斷廊房作戰、北寗路鐵軌破壤交通立時斷絕、平郊軍與時、平綏交通亦告停頓、是北平地、與外間交通、完令隔絕、當時只有平門支綫、（北平至門頭溝）尚能通行、至七月廿九日、宋晢元山平過門、轉來汽車赴長辛店、搭車赴保後日軍亦即追踪而至、在門頭溝投卡駐兵平門支綫、遂亦發生阻碍、平市四週交通斷絕食量燃料、來源組斷、發生恐慌、旋維持會成立、經協同北寗路局、與日軍方接洽、先謀恢復平津客貨通東、幾經折衝、始獲允準、每日清晨、平津對開一次、由平赴津旅客、極為擁擠、且沿途日軍用車絡繹不絕、每站須候車十數分鐘、至一二小時不等、全程僅二百四十里、竟需十二小時以上、日方並在北平前門車站、永定門豊臺等地、嚴厲檢查、尤以天津東站為甚、彼等最注意者、為軍人舉生、及與黨股府有關之人士、偶有不合、即有被扣之處、雖攜帶幼童所戴航空帽亦必犯界每次列車到站、所扣𣃮客、押往寗兵隊部審訊者至少在五十人以上、北𧶡津撿段通東、亦繼而實現、現在全綫車次、計有平瀋直過快車、每日正午十二時半對開一次、平津津榆通車、亦每日清晨對開一次、不堪忍受日人暴虐者、紛紛由平赴津、搭輪赴青島上海、此綫已成南北交通唯一孔道、平綏路於七月底中斷、旋入於軍事時期、日方為便利運輸起見、由交通兵修復路軌、每日行駛兵車、客貨車尚無確息、僅平門綫為便利運輸煤斤、業於前月恢復通車、每日對開二次、專運燃料、不售客票、至平漢路自中斷後、迄未恢復、現沿途各站、均出日軍派隊把守、</p>
<p>航空方面、中航歐亞兩公司航路、於事變後停止飛航、前在冀察政委會時成立之惠通公司、原為便利東京北平間道接通航、事變後各處飛機塲、均為日軍佔用、做轟炸華北之根據地、每日敵機三五十架、成羣結隊、在上空盤繞、所有空中交通俱被斷絕、交通部九省長途電話涌話後、平市對南方各地之連絡極為便利、同時有綫無綫電報、營業亦極發達、日軍進佔北平後、電話綫完全割斷、無綫電台發電機君被日方擭去、並派人監視電報局、電信交通、除市內電話外、均告停頓、最近日方將長途電話綫修復、但僅於北平與天津日本租界通話、有綫電亦僅限與東北及日本通報、天津牧報處由日方另在東馬路設立電報局、專司收發、但檢查極嚴、北平郵政近亦被日人攫得、郵件往來（信件句裹等）須被嚴密檢查、加以交通不便、郵件傳遞極為逞檢、由平外寄之快信、過去只須開車前五分鐘、即由車寄出、現在則須於十三小時前送由日人檢查許可後、始能寄遞、</p>
<p>㊂日人之統治政策</p>
<p>日軍部隊、於八月七日大舉入城後、首即壓制今方反抗勢力、阮玄武𣃮旣被繳械尚有警察保安隊等一萬餘人步槍手槍為數甚夥、除將軍人出身之保安隊長撤職外、並令潘毓桂將警察槍支全部繳出運往東交民巷該國兵營保存、對民間私存之槍支亦限期繳官、三日之內、獲得各種槍支約在萬餘、是時警察維持秩序、僅恃短棍於是白晝搶刦之事、層出無窮警察赤手空舉、即見之亦無力干涉、其發波及日鮮人住宅日方始感覺自身危險、乃尤酌為發還一部槍支、按照警區數目、每區各給步槍五十支、手槍十支、母枝附子彈十粒、並諭不得無故開放雖至必要時、亦應先行請示核准後、始得射擊、故現時少數警察、雖攜有槍支、實際與無槍者無甚差別、</p>
<p>國旗黨旗、及黨徽黨證、三民主義等書、於日軍進城之後即被嚴禁、機關學校等公共塲所之總理遺像、均一律銷燬、日方並嗾使警寮局嚴密偵緝黨務人員、及有關係、一律目為共產黨及藍衣社、更獎勵市民舉發、致　賊誣陷之事、日有所聞、當是時也、一本三民主義即是構成此罪𨬿證日憲兵隊部內囚犯累累的衛牛局長謝振平、曾為防止庽疫、在天壇備有防疫疫苗、日軍認為係製造毒菌、驟加速捕、拘禁兩月、方始釋放、其他身人囹圄、未知所犯何罪者、更比比皆是、生命財產毫無保隊除漢奸之外、尚無人敢保自身之安危、在北平居住之中央地方官吏軍人住宅、日憲兵隊每日隨意檢查逮捕外、並由漢奸組所調財產保管委員會、聲稱保管各要人之財產、待將來返平時再行發還、實則毫無保障、無形沒收、市民之生命財產、毫無保陣、日特務機關憲兵隊軍部均可隨時發號施令、任意檢查逮捕、甚至日韓浪人、假借名義、藉口搜查、反動份子、強素財物亦無人敢摟其鋒、日軍用車輛每日馳騁街頭、任眾衝撞、不幸慘死於輪日者、日必數起、亦無伸冤之處、</p>
<p>我同胞處於淫威之處、飽受摧殘之苦、而日人之統治、實行高壓政策、故人人敢怒而不敢言、另有一部日人、假意收賣人心、成立所謂實撫本部、更於各城設立辦公處、以日人精通我國情形者仟處長、以三四流漢奸任副處長、並邀集當地奸商土豪、成立寅撫委員會、利用文字宣傳日軍德政、偶代市民解決一二糾紛、亦必在於日方無損之條件之下、始能發生效力、實則不過代日方利誘我國周胞、使之統就範而已</p>
<p>㊃實施奴化教育</p>
<p>北不號稱文此城教育發達、舉生運動素種活躍、久為日人痛恨、此次日軍入城、文化機關、均被破壞、北京大學、師範人學、北平大學等國立學校、均改為駐軍塲所、教職員走避一空、校內什物破壞無遣、各校學生、隨意逮捕強殺、（法學院駐軍開出後、校投收拾房舍、發現三學生被刺刀刺死、）惟時在暑假期中、學生多數返里、即有一部於事變後、亦復逃出北平、現除燕京大學因敎會關係、仍照常開課外、其他均已停頓、</p>
<p>平市中等學校、為數嚴多、私立者、均由政府補助、事變後旣以學生不數、經費無著、大部無形停辦、間有少數以牧學費為月的之學校、勉強開學、學生亦寥寥無幾、小學及民眾學校則律彊迫開課、課本內提倡民族意識及抗日思想者、均由日方令維持會文化組、與社會局敎育科、負責刪改以是特線中小學課本審查委員會、分別審查、一一刪改原擬重新付印、嗣以趕辦不及、臨時剪𧵑應用、所有與黨義國家民族有關、以及青天白日滿地紅之國旗、均被刪去、</p>
<p>課程方面亦有極大之變動、黨義根本取消、日方並令警察局轉論、各校禁授黨義此外公民必為修身、軍事訓練軍事看護及童子軍改為武術、並加添日話一門、強迫學生上課以備養成毫無民族意識之漢奸、將來充彼等之活動傀儡、</p>
<p>日方對於過去學生運動、旣嚴予取締、同時製造偽學生組織、以金錢收買一部無恥學生、強拉同學及非學生、組織所謂華北學生聯合會、惟號召力極為薄弱、加入奢僅十餘人、開成立大會、會由維持會通令各校校長、必須攜帶學生出席、屆時則僅有初小學生百餘人、整隊人塲、致詞云云、均為例套、講奢自講、聽者毫無印象、演成一慕滑䅲劇、</p>
<p>日方對於高等敎育、擬根本取消、惟一般文人漢奸、則覬覦各校校長之美名、遂亦組織華北敎育總會、用代敎育最高機關、惟日方對此、並不積極維持、僅為一空頭機關而已、</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>德意與遠東事件</h3>
<p>— 胡念之</p>
<p>九國公約會議今天就要在比京開會了。這一次會議的成功與失敗，决定在主要各國對於遠東問題的態度。我國在這一次會議中探取什麼外交策略，也决定在主要各國的態度。所以在九國公約會議開始的時候，對於各國態度作一番檢討，是不可少的。</p>
<p>自從我國發動對日抗戰以後，各友邦政府人民對中國的同情，幾乎可以說是完全一致的。無論是英國也好，美國也好，法國也好，蘇聯也好，雖然同情的程度有差別，步調不一致，但是在反對日本侵略這一點上，却絕對沒有分別。在所謂“友邦”中間，使我們感覺不放心的；却只有兩個國家，就是德國和意大利。</p>
<p>直到最近為止，我們都承認德國和意大利是我們的友邦。但自從去年德國和日本訂結反共恊定之後，我們對於德國這個友邦便不能不有一些戒心。雖然在反共恊定訂結的時候，德國政府會經聲明不適用在中國，但是對於我們的敵人的同盟者，我們是不能不有戒備的。</p>
<p>德國不出席比京會議。據德國官方的解釋，因為德國要是出席比京會議，一定要書日本辯護，這樣就不免引起中國的不滿，所以索性不出席，以免左右為難。德國這一種態度，已經說明了德國同情於侵略者。此外，自從八一三以後，德國的報紙屢次為日本伸辯，說日本在中國的行動，目的在於反共防赤。想不到我們的友邦德國，竟和日本一鼻孔出氣，誣蔑三民主義的中國為“赤化”。無論如何，我們不能不承認德國報紙這一種說法，對於我國是一種不友誼的表示。</p>
<p>這幾天，更值得我們注意的，是敵方所宣傳的消息，說德國大使陶德曼現正進行調解中日兩國衝突。同時德國的財閥路德到了天津，向日本同盟社發表談話，主張日德兩國合作開發華北。我們希望日本方面所宣傳的這兩個消息，是完全造謠。假如不然，德國這些舉動，對於中國，不僅是不友誼的表示，而且是一種可怕的陰謀了。</p>
<p>不幸得很，意國在這次中日戰爭中所表示的態度，也不比德國好些。意相墨索里尼在報紙發表的論文，竟至公然袒護日本。意國雖然出席比京會議，但據報紙所傳，惟一的作用，是在替日本立塲辯護。最使我們痛心的，意國偏在九國公約會議開會的時候，準備參加德日友共恊定。原來意國已經决定為了對遠東侵略國的合作，而犧牲對中國的友誼了。</p>
<p>意國是法西斯國家，德國也是法西斯國家。法西斯主義雖然和三民主義不相容，但是我們决不因此而反對德意兩國。我們認為現在世界上只有和平集團與侵略集團的對立，所謂思想集團的對立，根本並不存在。卽使存在的話，中國也决不參加思想集團的鬥爭。中國不願意參加反共恊定，也就因為這綠故。但是不論是法西斯國家也好，民主國家也好，假如帮助我們的敵人，誣蔑我們的國體政制，甚至和侵略國勾結起來，共同分肥，那决不是我們所能寬恕的。</p>
<p>我國在抗戰中間，只承認日本是我們的敵人，對於此外一切國家，我們都願意友好相處。可是在一切“友邦”中間，我們應得有辨別。把人人都當作敵人，就等於放縱了眞正的敵人。但是把人人都當作友人，也就等於沒有一個友人。在九國公約會議中間，無論在外交上，或者在輿論上我們必須有這一個明確的認識才好。</p>

<h3>渡河敵軍大部肅淸劉家宅殘敵卽可殲滅</h3>
<p>吳家厙之敵經我軍三面夾擊受創　我扼守梵皇渡車站與敵隔河對峙　江橋小南翔一線仍有猛烈前哨戰</p>
<p>今晨字林西報載有我軍退出南市之離奇消息、本報記者今午晤及我軍事當局、絕對否認其事、謂南市近在咫尺、事實具在、無可掩飾、外報揣測紀載、空中樓閣、誠足淆亂人心、至前綫戰况、我軍仍佔優勢、敵雖分路渡河、均經我軍先後予以包圍痛勦、十之八九、己告肅淸、現僅小股敵陸戰隊盤踞劉家宅民房內、頑强抵抗、我軍正在搜索淸除中、吳家厙方面殘敵、人數較衆、經我軍三面夾擊、血戰二晝夜、卽可肅淸、現該村仍由我軍駐守、截至今午止、敵僅由隔河砲擊、尚不敢再行偷渡、外報又稱、渡河頑敵達八千人至一萬人、亦謬妄萬分云云、本報記者今午復親至滬西白利南路底視察、當時機關槍聲密集、間有砲聲、駐防英軍態度鎮靜、我軍仍扼守梵皇渡車站、與敵隔河對峙、機折至徐家匯、詢諸戰區難民、亦謂偷渡頑敵正在包圍激戰中、最後赴南市、巡行一週、一切情形如常、商店開門營業、警察維持秩序、雖遷居租界者較爲擁擠、但大部仍能安居樂業、不稍張皇、凡此均爲鐵一般的事實、外報所載、誠不知何所根據也、</p>
<h3>渡河敵軍已先後擊潰肅淸</h3>
<p>劉家宅尚盤踞少數陸戰隊　我軍仍堅守南岸沿河之綫　敵軍側?小南翔擊退</p>
<p>蘇州河北岸之敵、連日以來、以砲火及烟幕掩護、强行渡河、企圖進犯我南岸陣地、數處渡河之敵、經我軍猛烈撲擊後、幾已完全肅清、僅留極少數殘敵、但敵軍野心不死、昨晨至午、又散開兵力、共分多處、强行南渡、周家橋至申紀浜口之陳家渡、中經劉家宅、北新涇灘•屈家橋•吳家厙•應頭•等處、俱有敵軍踪跡、我軍早有準備、立卽調遣兵力、分頭堵截、以沉着之姿態、向敵軍進擊、不俟敵軍所放之烟幕消滅、立卽以密集之機槍、向烟幕中密射、幕後之敵、因此而中彈斃命、累累皆是、其餘頑敵、則仍向前突圍、遂展開激戰、相持至午後、雨下如注、敵軍之行動、頓時困阻、我軍遂冒雨自林肯路之北、猛烈出擊、向前推進、當將渡河之敵、截成數股、使其各失聯絡、立卽加以包圍、敵雖頑强抗拒、在我軍奮勇衝鋒之下、激戰至今晨拂曉、沿河一帶敵軍、遂先後宣告肅淸、擊潰之敵、分頭四散、僅少數匿居各斷垣殘壁之中、我軍正進行搜索工作、劉家宅方面、則尚有少數敵軍陸戰隊、又竄入破壁中、尚頑强抗拒、本報記者今晨往白利南路視察、則我軍仍扼守鐵路綫之西、該處來福槍及砲聲、時斷時續、足見我軍仍堅守河南沿岸之綫也、</p>
<p>江橋小南翔之綫、仍有猛烈之前哨綫、敵軍一度由胡家寺、向我小南翔進行側擊、結果仍被我軍逐走、廣福以北、戰事較爲沉寂、</p>
<h3>昨晚浦江兩度砲戰</h3>
<p>敵艦被我擊中狂嗚救命汽笛　??山碼頭軍火庫亦遭我砲轟</p>
<p>我浦東砲兵陣地、於昨晚八時十五分、又發揮强大火力、向滬東敵根據地、及浦江敵艦猛烈轟擊、一時隆隆之砲聲、將全綫沉寂之空氣震破、敵艦倉皇開砲還擊、故浦面火光閃動、砲聲緊密、驚動全滬、激戰十分鐘後、浦面發生一轟然巨響、當有泊於三號浮簡之敵砲艦一艘、爲我砲彈擊中、死傷士兵多名、該艦情急、狂嗚救命汽笛、並向下游駛開、以避我方目標、但我神勇之砲手、仍連續發射、未幾敵匯山碼頭軍火倉庫、又中我砲彈、由棧頂穿入內部、爆炸之聲甚巨、彼方損失之重大可知、我軍以任務已畢、始行停止、敵艦發砲亦漸稀少、至九時一刻、敵艦亟圖報復、首先開砲向浦東轟擊、我軍不甘緘默、又連續還擊、交戰之烈、較第一次尤甚、雙方互轟約半小時許、砲聲逐漸稀少、我方所發之砲、落人楊樹浦及虹口一帶敵方根據地內甚多、有二處中彈起火、敵艦兩次共開二百餘砲、僅轟倒民房若干間、死傷平民十餘人、嗣後全綫極爲平靜、今日上午十一時、有敵重轟炸機在浦東上空投彈轟炸、敵艦又乘機發砲轟擊、惟甚稀疎、我軍並不加以理會、敵共開二十餘砲、卽告沉寂、</p>
<h3>周家橋頑敵渡河被我殲滅經過</h3>
<p>施放烟幕紛紛渡河　三面圍擊無一生還</p>
<p>本報記者頃晤方自滬西周家橋回家之某長官、談及蘇州河兩岸之抗戰情形、具見勇猛壯烈、略謂余所率之部隊、現駐守於周家橋西某段、前日下午三時、天正陰雨、雙方砲火猛烈、敵之砲兵在我等防地之周圍、不斷射擊、俄而河濱</p>
<p>烟幕四散</p>
<p>隔河難辨、只聞足聲雜沓而來、知敵已偸渡來犯、余命所部散開、取三面包圍形勢、靜待殺敵、初以手溜彈向浮橋遠擲、因橋係帆布所製、質軟而不炸、於是以機槍猛射、敵始不敢陸續過河、但已到河南者、約一中隊三百餘人、此輩爲敵方之敢死隊、橫衝直撞、勢甚兇猛、我方除派機槍數架把守渡橋口外、三面部隊、</p>
<p>猛烈衝殺</p>
<p>以槍火而論、雙方不相上下、幸賴我士氣忠勇、奮不顧身、接戰至一小時以上、敵之倒斃者、約二百餘人、其餘亦趕築工事、憑壘頑抗、入晚我軍再度進剿、短兵相接、殺聲震天、敵且戰且退、橋至河濱渡口處、祇餘十餘頑敵、卒爲我軍完全殲滅、斯時烟幕已散、但見河北</p>
<p>遺屍數十</p>
<p>敵已後退、惟渡橋尚未撤去、蓋備渡河者後退之用、豈料敵人今無歸望、我等立將渡橋燬減、橋係數層帆布縫合、頗爲牢動、兩端繋木椿、以螺絲旋緊、寬約五尺、可分四路同時並進、該段河道較狹、故其運用亦便、若無猛烈槍火阻止、則三百敵兵、可於十分鐘內渡過、現我軍洞燭奸謀、嚴密防守、凡見施放烟幕之處、立卽用機槍掃射、使敵人不敢冒死前進、蓋非此不足以敢其偸渡之野心也、</p>
<h3>敵在天通庵附近築成臨時飛機塲</h3>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<h3>相</h3>
<p>九國公約會議。已定於今日午前十一時。在白魯塞爾國立研究院大禮堂行正式開幕典禮。故在筆者寫此稿時。正是羣英在白魯塞爾‘議論風生’之候。該會議之效果若何。此時固難加以預測。或則對於該會頗抱悲觀。或則對於該會還有希望。多是廢話。我現在並不作此種‘預言家式’化臆斷。我所欲言者。卽幾句事實問題。</p>
<p>原九國公約的產生。是解决歐戰以後之中國問題而簽訂。似乎九國公約。完全爲保全我國領土主權而設。其實自簽訂該約以後。我國領土主權之被人侵略者幾何矣。而且是侵略我國之國。卽是簽訂保全我國領土主權公約之國。</p>
<p>現在的形勢。只有侵略主義者與和平主義者兩大陣綫的戰爭。决不是僅僅關於某一國與某一地的問题。故欲预测那一陣綫之勝负。卽可看那一陣綫團結鞏固於鬆懈而定。持此標准。渺運。可以推知。</p>

<h3>固安抗敵之鏖戰</h3>
<p>敵四個師團渡河死傷甚重　我軍支持三晝夜士氣極盛</p>
<p>任邱通信、固安位於永定河之南岸、東西距津浦。平漢，兩路均不及百里、左提右挈、為兩路北段聯絡中心、自×××師接防以來、即積極構築工事、未及一月、敵人先後偷渡達三十餘次之多、均被擊退、至十月十三日上午、敵以四個師團、分上下游渡河、而以一個半師團兵力、猛攻我左翼之西玉及東西楊村兩處渡口、騎兵當先、步兵殿後、繼之以重砲及坦克車、作四路縱隊推進、行至河岸、分向左右開展、成一字形、愈行愈近、戰綫面積愈長、同時以飛機三十餘架掩護、並破壞我陣地、砲彈有如貫珠、我×××團守兵在此槍林彈雨烟霧迷濛之下、始終沉着應戰、敵屍枕藉、河流為之阻塞、激戰竟夜終以敵人砲火猛烈、我不得已始放棄西玉渡口、而暴敵之一個半師團竟從此渡河、使我永定至大清河間方百里之地、與無數人民為敵軍蹂躪殆遍、</p>
<p>敵渡河以後、一面以主力南進攻我相各荘陣地、一面分兵團攻我固安縣城、時守城兵力不及二營、經敵一千餘發之重砲轟擊後、西北兩面城坦、為之摧毀無餘、而我忠勇之士卒、猶奮不顧身、與敵肉搏、某連官兵八十餘名衝入敵人陣地擊殺敵人坦克車一輛、俘虜敵宣傳隊長一員、士兵二十餘名終以力竭、與敵百餘人同歸於盡、殉國之忠、於斯為烈矣、</p>
<p>當敵以主力攻我太子務一綫時、×××旅旅長趙文質、率預備隊增援、與敵遭遇敵向我猛撲十餘次、數百挺機槍同時掃射、趙旅長身中二彈、竟以一手拊創口、一手指揮、屹然不動、不幸又於腹下中二彈、頭部着戰刀傷二處遂昏迷倒地、後將敵人擊退、趙旅長得慶更生、而是役之猛烈、可想見也、</p>
<p>敵佔據我固安縣後、又拼命南進、侵我吉城彭村之第二綫、我×××團繼續接戰、同時×××團出左側反攻、其他各團之援兵續至、與敵彼此包圍、層層節制、已達混戰局面、支持達三晝夜以上、而我×××團猶能襲敵後方、截獲坦克車三輛、將敵擊退二十餘里、此時士氣奮極、頗有驅敵於永定河對岸之可能、終以後方牛駝鎭失守、左冀同時受敵壓迫、益以彈盡援絕、遂無法挽此頺局、</p>

<p>可是我們知道青年是國家的棟樑，社會的中堅，一個民族的生命，國家的前途，完全寄託在他身上。所以要挽救現代中國的危險，要復興我們的民族，都得靠着現代中國的靑年去實幹。</p>
<p>一般冷血的靑年，一般醉生夢死的靑年，都不配做現代的靑年。這種人不久一定要被淘汰的，但是怎樣才配做現代的青年呢？可簡括的分成下列幾點、㊀要有救國的决心，我們應切實地明瞭，國家是我們唯一的生命綫，沒有國家，就沒有民衆，救國家就是救自己的生命，也就是救大衆的生命。所以我們非抱着“國存與存國亡與亡”救國的决心不可。㊁要有軍事技術和常識現代的戰爭，並非徒恃槍砲的平面戰，却是立體戰和化學戰。所以我們首要培養豐富的科學常識，而且人人應具開槍殺敵的本領，防毒防空等常識。㊂要有强健的體格，我們素有“東亞病夫之稱。我們要消滅這不名譽的譏笑，應該加緊鍛練身體，造成鋼鐵一般的抵抗力量，作民族的先鋒隊。</p>
<p>其他為服從領袖，團結精神等，都是現代靑年所必具的條件。</p>
<p>全國的靑年們，快起來吧，我希望全國青年都要做現代的青年，那麼中國前途的光明，中華民族的復興，可不旋踵而實現了。</p>

        <h1>1937.11.03</h1>
<h3>Nine-Power Treaty Conference Opens This Morning; British Foreign Secretary Declares Determination to Cooperate with the U.S.</h3>
<p>With Resolve to Protect Interests and Fulfill International Obligations; Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon Also States Chinese Territory Inviolable</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden, in a speech in the House of Commons today, responded to opposition party attacks on the government's policy regarding the League of Nations and the Far East. Eden stated, "Whatever action is taken regarding the Far Eastern dispute depends entirely on the full cooperation of the United States. I can say without any doubt today that if American cooperation can be obtained on an equal footing, and an international conference is convened, I am willing to go not only from Geneva to Brussels, but even from Melbourne, Australia, to Alaska, and will never shrink from the labor. Under the current international situation, I hold this determination even more strongly." The Foreign Secretary further stated that all those who attack the government fail to understand that the position of the United States in Geneva is different from its position in Brussels, adding, "Of course, this difference is of utmost importance." Eden further responded to other criticisms, saying, "Although there are diplomatic secrets that cannot be disclosed, in the current situation, I should state clearly that the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference was not Britain, but the United States government." Eden then reiterated a remark made by a certain opposition leader, who recently expressed a fervent desire to cooperate with the U.S., and earnestly inquired, "In this dangerous and difficult Far Eastern situation, if Britain cannot move forward as the United States does and fully cooperate with the U.S., can Britain, without surpassing the U.S., at least follow closely behind without being left too far behind?" Eden stated, "I now fully accept this definition as a guiding principle for the future."</p>
<p>Regarding the League of Nations issue, Eden stated that he could not disregard the practical difficulties arising from the current weakness of the League of Nations, nor did he wish to debate who was to blame. Of the world's seven major powers, only three are members of the League. How can we say, then, that if you sincerely trust the League of Nations, the League's supreme power will be your backing? Eden himself deeply regrets this point, stating, "If all nations cannot uniformly accept the constraints of international law, as we have already accepted, then we cannot speak of lasting peace until the power opposing powerful aggressors is invincible."</p>
<p>Eden further stated that while Britain is willing to discuss the difficulties of any country, it will never be intimidated by the rising tide of brutality, such as those who speak of peace but in reality declare nothing less than an ultimatum. Eden then explained the basis of British foreign policy as follows: "While we are determined to protect our vital interests and fulfill our international obligations when necessary, we will never take actions that contradict the terms and spirit of the League of Nations Covenant or the Kellogg-Briand Pact. We firmly believe that disputes should be resolved through peaceful means and are willing to do our utmost to ensure that this principle is universally accepted and observed. Furthermore, while we acknowledge that the current League of Nations is significantly affected by the incompleteness of its membership, we still firmly believe that the League is the best way to achieve results. We should listen to any suggestions for reforming the League, but only to the extent that they can strengthen international trust and enable the League to fulfill the purposes stated in the Covenant. Therefore, we should not join anti-communist or anti-fascist groups, as our concern lies solely with other countries' foreign policies, not their internal affairs. We offer cooperation to all countries but cannot accept the command of other countries."</p>
<p>Opposition party leader Major Attlee rose to question, "Will the British government, at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, take the principle of the Nine-Power Treaty, namely guaranteeing the territorial integrity of China, as its stance?" Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon replied, "Yes, we should." Simon further stated, "According to the Nine-Power Treaty, each signatory country has undertaken not to infringe upon the territorial integrity of China and agrees to consult each other to seek a solution when the treaty is violated. This is why the Brussels Conference is convened, and how these promises are to be implemented is the purpose of our participation." Attlee then inquired whether the government would never enter into agreements with any country that infringes upon Chinese integrity or accept any measures. Simon replied that he did not wish to elaborate, saying, "This is what I can declare to the fullest extent. What the United States has already done is no different. In this matter, we and the United States are on the same side." (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters)</p>

Soviet Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinov and Deputy Commissar Potemkin also departed from Moscow on Sunday to come here. As for the American delegation, it was led by Chief Delegate Norman Davis and arrived here on October 28. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] After giving a speech in the House of Commons this afternoon, Foreign Secretary Eden left for Brussels to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald and Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Robert Vansittart also accompanied the Foreign Secretary. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>Brussels: Foreign Minister Spaak received Koo Vi Kyuin, Chief Chinese Delegate to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and other members of the Chinese delegation at 11:00 AM this morning. British Foreign Secretary Eden, who came here to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, arrived here this morning. Foreign Minister Spaak personally went to the station to greet him. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos left for Brussels at 11:30 AM this morning. Other members of the French delegation include Deputy Foreign Minister Teedsan, Deputy Colonial Minister Monéville, Assistant Director of League of Nations Affairs at the Foreign Ministry Lecourt, Assistant Director of Asian Affairs at the Foreign Ministry Herbette (former Counselor at the Embassy in China), and several experts and advisors. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>Brussels: The Chinese delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference arrived here in the afternoon. The Chief Delegate is Koo Vi Kyuin, Envoy to France, and the Deputy Delegates are Quo Tai-chi, Envoy to the United Kingdom, and Tsien Tai, Envoy to Belgium. Other members of the delegation include Jin Xiangsi, Envoy to the Netherlands, Hu Shih-tse, Envoy to Switzerland, Yang Yinpu, expert from the Chinese delegation to the League of Nations, Shi Zhaokui, Counselor at the Chinese Embassy in France, Liu Kai, First Secretary at the Embassy in the United Kingdom, and Yang Guang Sheng, editor-in-chief of the Shanghai Continental Newspaper. During the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Yang will be solely responsible for intelligence work for the Chinese delegation. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian delegation departed for Brussels last night. The Chief Delegate is Francesco Maria Taliani de Marchio, former Envoy to Germany and representative to the Lytton Commission. (2nd, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>Lisbon: The Portuguese government has appointed its Envoy to Belgium, Gastão de Castello Branco, as Chief Delegate to the Nine-Power Conference, with the Envoy to the United States, Helder Ribeiro de Queiroz, as Deputy Delegate. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Well-informed sources recently stated that the Soviet delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will re-propose the theory of forming a united front of democratic countries to oppose aggressor nations, as this theory complements the strategy of people's fronts in various democratic countries. However, the Soviet delegation will avoid proposing this theory alone, as although U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull have successively issued declarations advocating joint action by democratic countries, the actual results of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have not yet fully inspired confidence. In addition, political circles have expressed optimism about the general situation in the Far East, believing that since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the number of Japanese troops heading to China to join the war to break the Chinese resistance has gradually increased. As a result, border disputes between the Soviet Union and "Manchukuo" and conflicts between Soviet and Japanese/"Manchukuo" border guards, which were once frequent, have now ceased. Japan has also abandoned its unilateral attempt to demarcate the Soviet-"Manchukuo" border, indicating that it no longer intends to exert pressure on the Soviet border. As for the widespread rumors that the Soviet government intends to abolish the mutual assistance pact between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, so that Outer Mongolia can supply China with arms and other goods without involving the Soviet Union, responsible officials here have firmly denied these rumors, calling them absurd and unfounded, and stating that such absurd rumors are common. For example, as relations between the Soviet Union and Germany deteriorate, rumors claim that the Soviet Union is seeking to approach Germany, and so on. In short, the purpose of these rumors is nothing more than to shake the trust of the Soviet Union's friends in the Soviet Union. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, responsible parties have stated that the British delegation must seek a "way" to mediate between China and Japan. However, British political figures believe that China can only accept an honorable peace, while Japan will refuse to comply. Therefore, mediation efforts may be futile. In addition, negotiations on the Anti-Comintern Pact among Italy, Germany, and Japan have been successful and are about to be signed. Therefore, Italy will support Japan's views at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Furthermore, political figures also stated that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will discuss the issue of safeguarding the interests of various countries in China. The U.S. delegation will raise the issue of protecting the territories of all countries adjacent to China and Japan. Britain's attitude is to follow closely behind the United States. However, whether the United States will propose practical suggestions to resolve the dispute between China and Japan, or to ensure that the security of the interests of various countries in China and all territories near China are not affected, is what British political figures are eager to know. It is now known that Foreign Secretary Eden will only stay in Brussels for a few days before returning home, and Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs Malcolm MacDonald will take over as Chief Delegate. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<h3>Italy to Join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>[Rome] Authoritative sources here announced tonight that Italy is scheduled to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact within this week. This pact was signed on November 25, 1936, in Berlin by the German Envoy to the United Kingdom, Joachim von Ribbentrop, and the Japanese Envoy to Germany, Kōji Mushanokōji. Italy's accession at this time involves only signing the pact without drafting separate articles. The content stipulates that Germany, Italy, and Japan agree to inform each other of news regarding international communist activities and to discuss close cooperation in countermeasures, while also inviting other countries to participate. (1st, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Yesterday, official circles denied the claim that Germany and Italy had an understanding to assist each other militarily in certain situations, stating that it can now be clearly stated that Germany has no military alliance with Italy. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<h3>London Times Explains the Significance of the Brussels Conference</h3>
<p>Related to Joint Action by Various Countries to Restore Peace; Anglo-American United Front Now Indestructible, London</p>
<p>[London] The Times commented today, "If reason in the Far East is to return sooner rather than later, then both East and West must truly understand what the Brussels Conference is. The Brussels Conference is not a court endowed with punitive powers but rather a gathering of responsible nations, some of whom are extremely concerned about life in the Far East and must gather to discuss what joint diplomatic action should be taken to promote the restoration of peace." The newspaper further stated that the war occurring within China is indeed within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, the League of Nations General Assembly has adopted a practical approach, allowing each signatory country of the treaty to gather and discuss response methods on its own. Therefore, the League of Nations has no suspicion of interference, as used by the Japanese government to deceive its domestic populace. Furthermore, the U.S. President's speech in Chicago has further increased the importance of the League of Nations' advocacy and the scope of its agenda, but has not changed the original intention. President Roosevelt's remarks have clearly pointed out the goal, without any doubt, and are completely consistent with the British position. Therefore, the United States' attendance at the Brussels Conference is a fact of utmost value. Thereafter, at any time during the conference, any action taken will definitely receive the full response of the British representative and his government, and the people in the rear. This has already been determined as an unwavering compass, as this Anglo-American united front is not damaged or hindered by any doubts or concerns. The Western countries, just like Japan, deeply feel that the stability of the Far East depends on the two relevant countries having a normal relationship. As for meaningless hostility, whether it comes from this side or that side, bullying or despising the Chinese people, regarding them as politically inferior people who only deserve to be slaves of puppet governments, is insufficient to speak of stability. And the fact that Japan is exposed to China's inevitable resistance and the financial exhaustion that this war will cause after mediation fails, offers no guarantee. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The Times recently commented on the Far Eastern issue with mockery, stating, in brief, that Japan, under the pretext of pursuing a "self-defense" policy, is fulfilling its plan to expand its territory, starting with the Korean border and invading Mongolia and Siberia, and is about to reach the Yellow River in China. "The goal of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is to use peaceful means to facilitate an early end to the war between China and Japan. There is a simple fact here that urgently needs attention, namely, that Japan's actions have already raised the issue of the practice of treaty obligations. Concerned countries, for the sake of maintaining peace, have invited the United States to cooperate within a certain area and to a certain extent, and the United States has accepted. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese dispute has become a major international issue. If the Nine-Power Treaty Conference fails, it will inevitably create a new situation that we urgently need to address, which Foreign Secretary Eden has already pointed out some time ago, and should be avoided by all politicians in East Asia and Western Europe."

<h3>British-Japanese Discord Increasing</h3>
<p>Major Company Shareholders Plan to Boycott Goods Automatically; Japan Apologizes Again for the Shelling of British Soldiers</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the case of three British soldiers in Shanghai being killed by Japanese shells on the evening of October 29, the Japanese Embassy here originally stated that the Japanese army had not fired at the time. Now, a public statement has been issued stating that according to the results of the investigation, the soldiers were indeed killed by Japanese shells. The Japanese military authorities have taken appropriate measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The Japanese government is willing to provide appropriate compensation to the families of the deceased. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the matter of Japanese shells killing three British soldiers in Shanghai, official sources have confirmed that the Japanese government has formally apologized to the British government and promised to compensate for the losses. Therefore, it is generally believed that this dispute has come to an end. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the incident in which British Air Attaché Murray and others at the British Embassy in China were shot at by Japanese aircraft near Shanghai on the 12th of last month, Conservative Party MP Astor asked Foreign Secretary Eden during the House of Commons meeting today whether the Japanese government had responded to the British protest. Foreign Secretary Eden declared, "The Japanese government sent a note to British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive, informing him of the results of the investigation, expressing regret, and stating that appropriate measures would be taken to punish those responsible. After receiving this note, the British government immediately instructed Ambassador Clive to notify the Japanese government that the British government considers this case to be closed, but that the British government should be notified at any time of the measures taken by the Japanese government to punish those responsible. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] According to news from Tokyo, some Japanese Diet members held a meeting yesterday and resolved that if Britain does not change its current attitude towards the Far East issue, Japan should decide on serious measures to deal with it. This news shocked British people. Later, it was learned that the so-called serious measures only refer to severing relations with Britain in spirit and morality. Anxiety has eased slightly. Currently, British financial figures are eager to preserve the achievements made by Sir Otto Niemeyer in assisting China's financial recovery. It is believed that the repeated killings of British soldiers by Japanese shells in Shanghai may result in a strong reaction in Britain, the intensity of which may exceed the spiritual rulings that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can pass. In addition, the movement to boycott Japanese goods in Britain, which had once subsided due to government opposition, is now being advocated by many British people in the form of individual actions. It is reported that the majority of shareholders in certain major companies plan to propose to stop trading with Japan at the shareholders' meetings of their respective companies at the end of this year, especially major oil companies will take this approach and stop supplying Japan with oil. If so, the issue of Japan's fuel supply will become a problem. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Tokyo Asahi Shimbun today published a commentary entitled "Britain Losing Impartiality," stating that Britain, whose sphere of influence is in the Yangtze River area, has unexpectedly witnessed the outbreak of a major incident in Shanghai. It would not be surprising to Britain, but rather that there is some reason for it. Britain is acting excessively, desperately cooperating with China on anti-Japanese issues. British officials and those related to the garrison in Shanghai, as well as the press, and even businessmen, are all acting rashly. This is evidenced by facts. This is Britain's loss of impartiality in its tone and attitude toward Japan. Britain has not gained a proper understanding of the Sino-Japanese Incident. British public opinion is dominated and mobilized by a one-sided anti-Japanese sentiment. The Times has sunk to this low level, and others can be inferred similarly. (2nd, Allied News Agency)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Rejects Labour Party's Impeachment Motion</h3>
<p>International Major Issues: Eden Explains Response Strategy</p>
<p>[London] The British Labour Party's motion of censure against the government, concerning issues such as the League of Nations, the Sino-Japanese War, and the Spanish situation, was rejected in the House of Commons today by 363 votes to 142 after impassioned speeches by Foreign Secretary Eden and Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon. The motion of censure was proposed by Labour MP Morrison, stating, "His Majesty's advisors, in their foreign policy, have been weak, indecisive, and have endangered lasting peace and national security, violated the principles of the League of Nations, and diminished Britain's prestige. Moreover, due to their lack of constructive and fundamental preparation to improve the standard of living of the people on a proper and permanent basis, they have forfeited the confidence of this House."

<p>[London] During the debate on the address draft in the House of Commons a few days ago, opposition party members had criticized the government's current foreign policy. This afternoon, Foreign Secretary Eden, before departing for Beijing to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, made a lengthy speech in the House of Commons to respond to these criticisms. He addressed the Sino-Japanese dispute, Germany's request for the restoration of its former colonies, and the Spanish situation. Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, he stated, "Members of the opposition parties have raised questions, asking whether we are cooperating fully with the United States in this difficult situation in the Far East, following closely but not seeking to stand out, yet not lagging behind. I answer that I fully accept this view and will take it as our goal."</p>
<p>Regarding the transfer of negotiations on the Far Eastern issue from Geneva to Brussels, this was because the United States, not being a member of the League of Nations, required a meeting outside the League to participate on an equal footing. Any action concerning the Far Eastern dispute, regardless of its nature, requires the joint cooperation of the United States to be effective. (Applause) I declare without hesitation that, in this tense situation, to enable the United States to cooperate fully with us on an equal footing in addressing international disputes, I am willing to travel not only between Geneva and Brussels but also to Melbourne, Australia, and the Alaskan Peninsula." The rumor that the British government had put pressure on former Belgian Prime Minister Janson to convene the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is untrue. The choice of Beijing as the conference venue was originally initiated by the United States government. Furthermore, former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George's criticism of the government's passive attitude towards the Far Eastern dispute since 1931 is not true. I have reviewed the files extensively and can confirm that no one in the League of Nations has ever proposed economic sanctions against Japan. The blame cannot be solely placed on Britain. Regarding Germany's demand for the restoration of its former colonies, there is a certain country that, after the war, acquired vast territories in Europe and received a portion of the African territories formerly belonging to its allies as compensation for participating in the war. This country now supports Germany's demand. On this matter, we must clearly state that as long as a certain country's government is not prepared to relinquish its own land to satisfy Germany's demands, we cannot recognize any government's right to demand the cession of colonies from our country. (Applause)</p>
<p>Regarding the Spanish situation, former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George stated that the current non-intervention policy only benefits the Nationalist forces in Spain. This statement is not entirely accurate. The Republican government in Spain has a long coastline in the western Mediterranean, allowing it to import various goods and munitions from other countries, especially the Soviet Union. Since the establishment of the Nyon Agreement and the disappearance of piracy in the Mediterranean, this method of importing goods has become even more convenient. The effectiveness of Soviet-made tanks and aircraft in the Spanish Civil War is well known. Regarding the recognition of belligerent status, without foreign intervention, the Nationalist forces in Spain would likely have already obtained belligerent rights. The naval strength of the Nationalist forces is superior to that of the government forces. Once the Nationalist forces are recognized by other countries as belligerents, they will inevitably have an advantage. In essence, although the Nationalist forces have received assistance from foreigners on land, they have paid a heavy price in that they cannot obtain belligerent rights at sea because of this. I dare say that if the details of how the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War receive weapons and other assistance from abroad were revealed, members of this House would be amazed. Foreign Secretary Eden then stated that even if the Nationalist forces in Spain achieve final victory, the future government of that country may not adopt an anti-British policy. "Regardless of the outcome of the Spanish Civil War, we are willing to establish friendly relations with that country, and I believe that the authorities in that country will feel the same way."</p>
<p>Concluding his remarks, Foreign Secretary Eden stated, "We will resolutely defend all interests vital to the survival of Britain. We will also fulfill all international obligations stipulated by the Covenant of the League of Nations and the Pact of Paris. The League of Nations is currently facing some obstacles, but it still provides the best tool for resolving international disputes through peaceful means. Any proposal that strengthens the League of Nations' structure is welcomed by Britain. Britain will not participate in anti-communist or anti-fascist blocs. We are willing to work hand in hand with all countries but will not be dictated to by anyone. Regarding the Far East issue, we must recognize the various difficulties of the Far Eastern situation. I am departing tonight for Beijing to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference with this spirit, and I will do my best to contribute. This is what I can report to the members of this House before my departure." (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Today's routine cabinet meeting convened at 10:20 a.m. First, Foreign Minister Hirota reported that due to difficulties in forming a successor cabinet in Belgium, which had initiated the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it was uncertain whether the conference would convene on the 1st. Then, Navy Minister Nagai and Army Minister Sugiyama exchanged views on security work in North China. The Foreign Minister also reported on the signing of an important diplomatic matter, and it was decided to consult the Privy Council.

<h3>Japan Plans to Establish Wartime Headquarters</h3>
<p>Major Personnel Shifts in the Army: Hata and Koiso Promoted to Generals</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Important opinions have arisen within the Japanese government following the development of the Sino-Japanese war, advocating the establishment of a wartime headquarters to achieve the goals of the China Incident as soon as possible and to ensure no regrets in handling the situation. Prime Minister Konoe has been soliciting opinions from various parties, mainly the army and navy, and the result is that all parties unanimously agree with this plan. The government has therefore decided to apply the wartime headquarters ordinance promulgated during the Russo-Japanese War to establish a headquarters in Tokyo and realize a wartime system with comprehensive preparations. The timing will be decided after considering the development of the war situation in the Shanghai area and the attitudes of the countries at the Nine-Power Conference, approximately in mid-November. The staff of the headquarters will likely be composed of the Chief and Vice Chief of the General Staff, the Chief and Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff, the Army and Navy Ministers, and the Prime Minister. (2nd, Domei News)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Major personnel changes and promotions will occur in the Japanese Army. Hata Shunroku, Inspector General of Military Education, and Koiso Kuniaki, Commander of the Korean Army, will be promoted from lieutenant general to general. (1st, Domei News Agency)</p>
<h3>U.S. Building Six Large Airships</h3>
<p>Each Capable of Carrying 75 Passengers: Future Flights to the Far East</p>
<p>Seattle: The United States is currently building six extremely large airships, with a carrying capacity of over 42 tons, capable of carrying 50 passengers, with a speed of approximately 200 miles per hour, powered by four 1,500-horsepower engines. The range is over 3,200 miles. If the range is slightly shorter, it can carry up to 75 passengers. If there are fewer than 50 passengers, the route can exceed 5,000 miles. Test flights will first be conducted between Europe and America, and then they will be used in the Pacific Ocean to the Far East and Australia. The ships will be equipped with various facilities, such as air conditioners and soundproofing devices. The crew will consist of ten people, each with a bedroom. The ship's body is even larger than the ship Columbus first used to cross the Atlantic Ocean. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Fundraising to Aid China's Epidemic Prevention</h3>
<p>Labour MP Raises Questions: Foreign Secretary Eden Explains Misunderstanding</p>
<p>[London] Labour MP Smith inquired in the House of Commons today about the British government's policy regarding the League of Nations' fundraising to prevent epidemics in China. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that at the meeting of the League of Nations Council on October 1st, the British government agreed to request the League of Nations Health Committee to draft a plan to advise and assist the Chinese government in epidemic prevention and medical relief, and agreed to provide technical cooperation to China, and requested the League of Nations Assembly to increase annual subsidies to meet the needs of the current special environment. All of the above suggestions have been adopted by the League of Nations Assembly. Eden further stated that the British government expressed great sympathy for the proposal of voluntary donations but temporarily reserved its decision on donations. Smith continued to raise a supplementary question, and Eden replied that it was inaccurate to say that the external representative and Scottish Affairs Minister Elliot first supported the proposal, but that after the external representative met with the Japanese permanent representative, the British representative was instructed not to support the proposal any further. Eden said, "Regarding the increase in subsidies from the League of Nations, we have not only supported it but also voted in favor of it. The only unresolved point is voluntary donations. However, our attitude is very clear: if other countries can contribute according to their share, we will follow suit." Smith then said, "This is what I wanted to know. Shouldn't Britain take the lead in uniting all peace-loving countries?" Eden replied, "There is a misunderstanding here. I did not personally participate in the discussion at the time. I heard afterward that there was no concrete proposal put forward at the meeting. We have supported all concrete proposals that have been put forward. Our position is very clear." Eden concluded, "We have unanimously agreed to increase British subsidies so that more funds can be available. The British government has fully fulfilled its duty here, and our willingness to cooperate with other countries to ensure the success of international voluntary donations is also very clear." (Central News Agency, 1st, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Our Representative Declares Final Position</h3>
<p>Brussels: After arriving here today, Dr. Wellington Koo, China's chief representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, declared that unless the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can establish peace based on the principles of international law, China will fight Japan to the end. Koo also said that China will not accept any peace proposal that is incompatible with the spirit and provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty. He further said that today's war in the Far East should be a cause for alarm and vigilance for all peace-loving countries. If countries do not make a concerted effort to achieve a peace that is consistent with justice, then any peace-loving country will inevitably suffer aggression in the future. (2nd, National News)</p>

<h3>Enemy Forces Fleeing Across Suzhou Creek in Multiple Directions, Our Encirclement and Annihilation Not a Concern</h3>
<p>Most Have Been Cleared, Remnants Still Being Searched For; Fierce Fighting Throughout the Day Along the Guangfu Town to Hujiazhai Line; Enemy Attacking Xiaonxiang and Wangtangqiao Repelled</p>
<p>This newspaper received a front-line battle report at 3:30 a.m. this morning stating that yesterday (the 2nd), from morning to evening, there were battles along the entire line on the left and right flanks and the front, except for the relatively quiet Shixianggong Temple area, especially fierce battles along the Guangfu Town and Suzhou Creek banks. ❶ On the right flank, the enemy north of Suzhou Creek was urgently attempting to penetrate west Shanghai and pressure the southern city, concentrating strong forces to cross the river in multiple directions. After their first attempt to cross the river was defeated by our forces' fierce attack, they again, from the evening of the previous day (the 1st) to yesterday morning, with twice the number of troops as before, under the cover of heavy artillery, forcibly crossed the river at seven locations, namely Zhongshan Road Bridge, Xujia Bridge, Liujiazhai, Beixinjing, Qujia Bridge, Wujiazhai, and Tingtou. We immediately dispatched corresponding forces to block and strike in different directions, fighting fiercely all night. After several charges, by about 8:00 a.m. yesterday, all enemy troops were finally repelled. However, the enemy at Tingtou and Wujiazhai, numbering about 300, were stronger, and after being fiercely attacked by our army, more than 100 remained, entrenched in the civilian houses there. At 0:00 a.m. this morning, they were still stubbornly resisting, but they had been surrounded by us and their annihilation was imminent, not a concern. In addition, in the Liujiazhai area, around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, approximately 200 enemy troops crossed the river and invaded. They are currently surrounded and engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy artillery on the north bank heavily bombarded the Toyota Mill and Beixinjing line. In the morning, a large number of planes heavily bombed various locations in West Shanghai, but our fortifications did not suffer significant damage. ❷ On the left flank, the enemy southeast of Guangfu gathered more than a regiment of troops, first bombarding heavily with concentrated artillery fire, followed by small tanks as a vanguard, covering their infantry, to attack our line from Guangfu Town to Hujiazhai. We had heavy troops stationed there, and immediately rose up to attack, while also constantly counterattacking with artillery. Until dusk, they were still fighting bloody battles on that line. ❸ On the central road, the enemy in front of Xiaonxiang, starting at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, used a large number of tanks, divided along the new and old highways, to attack our Wangtangqiao position east of Xiaonxiang. However, there were not many infantry. Our army used mortars and small steel cannons to bombard them fiercely. After about three hours of battle, the enemy's tanks were still unable to cross our cordon, so after 7:00 p.m. that evening, it gradually calmed down.</p>
<p>A follow-up report received at 3:00 a.m. this morning stated that around 10:00 a.m. yesterday, more than 300 enemy troops on the north bank took advantage of the smoke screen at Yaojiadu, where the Shenji Canal and Suzhou Creek meet, and secretly crossed the river, invading Yaojiazhai on the south bank. Initially, because our army's strength was relatively weak, the position there was broken through by them. Large forces were immediately dispatched to encircle and attack from the southeast, west, and three sides. After a bloody battle into the evening, more than half were killed by us. The remaining remnants, except for a small part who fled back to the north bank, had several dozen remaining who fled eastward in disarray and are currently being searched for. According to military news, our army has redeployed and strengthened fortifications in the Xujia Bridge to Beixinjing area of West Shanghai, making the positions even more solid.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Cross Suzhou Creek Again</h3>
<p>Encircled and Attacked by Us, Ultimately Unsuccessful</p>
<p>Enemy troops are urgently attempting to achieve a quick victory, concentrating forces on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek and constantly attempting to cross secretly, hoping to find a foothold on the south bank in order to launch a large-scale attack. However, for the past three days, each attempt has been annihilated and repelled by us. Yesterday morning, enemy aircraft were unusually active, but disappeared in the afternoon due to rain. However, the sound of artillery did not stop all day. Enemy troops continued to cross, but most have been cleared. The Central News Agency's accompanying military reporter reported the war situation on the south bank as follows at 10:45 p.m. last night:</p>
<p>Enemy at Liujiazhai Encircled by Us</p>
<p>After the enemy at Chenjiadu, west of Zhoujia Bridge and Zhai, was repelled twice in their attempt to cross secretly, the enemy used the same trick again at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, erecting a canvas bridge under the cover of artillery and smoke. Although our army knew the enemy's plan, they were forced to retreat temporarily due to the dense artillery fire. About 200 enemy troops swarmed in and occupied Liujiazhai. Just as they were trying to build fortifications, our army launched a fierce counterattack. After a long battle, countless enemies were killed. By 3:00 p.m., the enemy was overwhelmed and retreated westward, fleeing into a certain foreign house. The house had a strong structure, like a fortress. The enemy fought stubbornly, and our army was unable to capture it after repeated attacks, so it was surrounded. In the evening, concentrated artillery fire was used to bombard it, and it should not be difficult to resolve the entire situation.</p>
<p>Severely Attacking and Scattering the Enemy at Yaozhai</p>
<p>The remaining enemy troops at Wujiazhai suddenly broke through to the south at 2:00 p.m. yesterday, attacking our Caijiazhai fiercely. They were once broken through, but our army reinforced and counterattacked, and by 4:00 p.m., the original position was restored, and the enemy was heavily surrounded. As of the evening, fighting was still ongoing. To the west, at Yaojiazhai, about 100 enemy troops crossed the river around 10:00 a.m., but after being intercepted by us, many enemies were killed. The remaining 30 or 40 fled east and west, and our army is searching and clearing them out. In addition, enemy troops were preparing to cross secretly at Lujiazhai, west of Zhenbei Road, but after being bombarded by us, the enemy was unable to cross. The Toyota Mill area was calm and there was no fighting.</p>
<p>Intercepting the Few Remaining Enemy at Tingtou</p>
<p>Military news states that approximately 300 enemy troops on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek secretly crossed to the south bank under the cover of artillery fire the night before and divided to attack Tingtou and Yaojiazhai, our army's positions. Our army was prepared and after a valiant counterattack, immediately repelled the enemy in the Yaojiazhai area. However, the enemy troops in the Tingtou area were stronger and forcibly occupied many civilian houses after a fierce battle until noon, and seemed to have a foothold, so the situation was quite critical for a time. Our army rushed to reinforce the encirclement and annihilation, so the enemy's momentum did not spread. After a day and night of interception, there are few remaining enemies, so it is no longer a concern.</p>
<p>Quickly Resolving the Enemy at Zhujia Bridge</p>
<p>At the same time, enemy troops also crossed at Zhujia Bridge, Beixinjing, Xujiajing, and Xujiazhai, but were quickly driven out and cleared by us. The enemy concentrated artillery fire and mortars to bombard the Toyota Mill, and although the factory buildings were damaged, our army's fortifications near the factory were not affected. Enemy aircraft were unusually active along the Suzhou Creek yesterday morning and dropped many bombs, all of which fell in the fields and did not cause any damage. Enemy aircraft disappeared in the afternoon due to heavy rain.</p>
<p>Thoroughly Clearing the Enemy at Xujia Bridge</p>
<p>For the past three days, enemy troops on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek have repeatedly attempted to cross secretly, attempting to attack our south bank positions. From Xujia Bridge through Beixinjing to Yaojiadu at the mouth of the Shenji Canal, several points on the south bank have been crossed by them. The enemy at Xujia Bridge and Beixinjing has been almost completely annihilated after being fiercely attacked by us. Only a very small number of remaining enemies at Xujia Bridge are entrenched north of Hopeland Road, near Liujiazhai. Yesterday morning, the remaining enemies once broke through to the east, rushing to the Toyota Mill area, but were swept by our army with dense machine gun fire, with the dead and wounded covering the ground, and retreated back to Liujiazhai. The night before, our army strictly surrounded and searched the Liujiazhai area for the purpose of clearing it out. Although the enemy resisted stubbornly, countless were killed, and the rest fled into the water. According to front-line reports, the enemy crossing the river at Zhoujia Bridge and Liujiazhai yesterday morning has been completely cleared, and there are no enemy traces near the Toyota Mill, which is firmly guarded by our army.</p>
<p>Artillery Battle All Night, Infantry Melee</p>
<p>The enemy who secretly crossed from Houjiadai, northwest of Beixinjing, and Chenjiadu, at the mouth of the Shenji Canal, to the south of the river the day before, occupied the two villages of Wujiazhai and Tingtou as strongholds under the cover of artillery fire, attempting to advance south. Artillery fire did not stop all day, bombarding our positions. Although the weather was extremely gloomy and cloudy, and the air pressure was very low, enemy aircraft were still active at an altitude of more than 1,000 meters. Our army calmly responded and closely monitored the situation. In the evening, they advanced to suppress and gave them a severe blow. Our artillery teams concentrated on bombarding the river bank, and the machine gun teams advanced towards Tingtou and Wujiazhai.

<p>Scouting teams of the forward infantry crawled forward and threw grenades fiercely. There was artillery warfare and infantry melee all night. At midnight the night before, the enemy hiding in Wujiazhai was tightly surrounded by our army and could be resolved.</p>
<p>Central News Agency's accompanying military reporter reported at 12:00 noon on the 2nd that the sound of artillery on both sides of the Suzhou Creek in West Shanghai has not stopped and has lasted for more than 50 hours. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy made two secret crossings, which were intercepted by us. After a fierce battle until dawn today, most of the enemy at Liujiazhai had been annihilated. The remaining despicable elements, without a foothold, retreated stealthily at dawn, so there was no trace of the enemy there. Those who crossed at Houjiadai were forced westward by our pressure and pursuit. There were still more than 100 people who were surrounded by us in the civilian houses of Wujiazhai. The enemy had no way to retreat, so they were still stubbornly resisting. The enemy suffered heavy losses from multiple secret crossings in the past two days. Therefore, since last night, they have been bombarding the entire line from Zhongshan Road to Shenji Canal on the south bank with artillery, and the rumbling sound has continued all night. After dawn today, multiple enemy aircraft dropped bombs to assist in the battle, and our army also returned fire with artillery. The sound of artillery did not stop until noon.</p>
<p>The Enemy at Chenjiadu Once Annihilated</p>
<p>Central News Agency's accompanying military reporter reported at 12:30 p.m. on the 2nd that around 2:00 a.m. this morning, about 300 enemy troops again released a smokescreen from the Chenjiadu area to cover a secret crossing. Our army advanced from Liujiazhai, approached the bank, and swept the smoke with machine guns. Only a few crossed and landed on the south bank, but after being surrounded in three places, they were all annihilated by 4:30 a.m. The enemy deaths reached more than 130 people.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Attacking Wangtangqiao Repelled</h3>
<p>Military news states that a large enemy tank unit that was attacking Wangtangqiao along the Nanxiang-Dachang Highway also went south the day before and attacked Wangtangqiao, about two kilometers south of Xiaonxiang. Our army fought valiantly and repelled the enemy. The enemy who attacked the north of Jiangqiao Town was also driven away by our army.</p>
<h3>Fierce Artillery Battle in Pujiang Last Night</h3>
<p>The Enemy Attempted to Land Yesterday Morning But Failed</p>
<p>Military news states that around 7:00 a.m. yesterday, enemy ships in the Pujiang River once again fired on Pudong, attempting to cover the landing of enemy troops in the Chunjiang Pier area. However, our army was well prepared. When the enemy approached, they immediately swept with machine guns. The enemy saw that the situation was unfavorable and fled in a panic, and the enemy's attempt ultimately failed. At 9:30, while enemy aircraft were conducting reconnaissance and bombing in Pudong, enemy ships in the Pujiang River frequently fired artillery, and after a joint sea-air operation in the rear, the situation became quite tense for a time. The entire line of our army was ordered to be on high alert. Enemy ships fired a total of more than 20 shells, and then there was silence again. After the fact, the reporter went to visit a certain senior officer. According to the discussion, the Pudong positions were absolutely safe. Although there were small enemy motorboats in the Pujiang River carrying soldiers and traveling back and forth on the surface of the river in the Hongkou Yangshupu area, it was purely a patrol nature, and they never dared to take any active action. Moreover, our lines are solid, and the alert is strict. It is difficult for enemy boats to approach the Pudong beach, and even more impossible to land. In short, the stability of the entire Pudong line is as usual.</p>
<p>At 8:10 p.m. last night, enemy ships anchored in the Pujiang River, led by the enemy flagship Izumo, suddenly launched a fierce artillery attack on the Yangjiadu, Zhangjiabang, and Tangqiao Town areas of our Pudong. Our Pudong artillery positions immediately returned fire. At first, there were few shells, but at 8:30, the artillery fire suddenly became dense, with each other firing two or three shells per minute, or five or six shells at most. The rumbling sound shocked the vicinity. At 8:50, the sound of artillery gradually subsided. Earlier, at around 5:00 p.m. yesterday afternoon, enemy ships in the Pujiang River had also bombarded our Pudong once, but we ignored it, and it soon stopped.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Again Announces Many Officers Died in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Also, 1,600 Wounded Soldiers Were Shipped Back to Japan, Along With Eight Seaplanes and Many Boxes of Parts Shipped to Shanghai</p>
<p>The enemy has announced another batch of fourteen officers above the rank of naval and army captain who died in battle in Shanghai, including Army Major Kajisako Kageyuki, Captains Yamamichi Toyokichi, Tanaka Mutsuo, Kudo Takeshi, Nomura Hiroshi, Nakajima Heisaburo, Shinkawa Nakazo, Tsukiwazawa Motokatsu, Kawaguchi Joji, Medical Corps Lieutenant Colonel Moriya Shozo, Major Ikeda Genshin, Captain Chida Nishio, Engineer Captain Karasawa Osamu, and Navy Captain Nanbu Yukimori. The number of soldiers who died in battle as reported by the enemy media exceeds one hundred per day, which shows how severely the enemy is being hit.</p>
<p>In recent days, enemy troops have repeatedly attempted to cross the Suzhou Creek by stealth but have been surrounded and annihilated by our forces, resulting in increasingly heavy casualties. Yesterday afternoon at approximately 1 p.m., the enemy merchant ship converted into a Red Cross vessel, "America Maru," arrived in Shanghai and docked at the Osaka Wharf. That evening, it loaded over 600 wounded soldiers in preparation for sailing back to Japan today. Additionally, the enemy merchant ship converted into Transport Ship No. 106, "Tsutsuura Maru," transported the sixth batch of over 3,000 enemy reinforcements to Shanghai in one day, and then reloaded approximately 1,000 wounded enemy soldiers that evening, sailing back to Japan around noon on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at approximately 11 a.m., the enemy's giant transport ship "Haruhisa Maru" sailed to Shanghai and docked at the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf, carrying eight assembled seaplanes, many boxes of unassembled aircraft parts, and over a thousand bombs. Additionally, the enemy destroyers "Umikaze" No. 24 and "Yamikaze" accompanied it as escorts, and they are currently docked at the No. 5 and No. 6 pontoons across from the China Merchants Bureau's Central Wharf.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Army Uses Poison Gas Again</h3>
<p>Military News: (Delayed) In the Luodian-Liuhang area, the enemy army has been unusually active again after receiving reinforcements. On the 28th of last month, the enemy actually used poison gas at Gejiatou and Qingshuitou, but due to unfavorable weather conditions and a sudden change in wind direction, our army seized the opportunity to launch a fierce counterattack, killing several hundred enemy soldiers and capturing many enemy soldiers and a considerable number of rifles.</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery Regiment Commander Seriously Wounded</h3>
<p>Ishida Nagatsugu, the enemy artillery regiment commander who was directing enemy artillery operations in Qianjiazhai, north of the Suzhou Creek in western Shanghai, was struck by artillery fire from our artillery positions on the 31st of last month, resulting in serious injuries. He is currently being treated at the enemy wounded soldiers hospital on Miller Road in Hongkou. At the same time, six enemy junior officers were killed and five were wounded, and a total of over 250 soldiers were killed or wounded.</p>
<h3>The Astonishing Display of the Isolated Army in Zhabei Fully Demonstrates China's Great Progress</h3>
<p>Their loyal and courageous spirit is sufficient to revitalize the declining morale; this matter has made a profound impression on the whole world.</p>
<p>—The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury Praises Highly——</p>
<p>Yesterday, the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" published an editorial stating that the whole world was greatly relieved to hear that the isolated army in Zhabei had safely retreated from the ruined warehouses north of the Suzhou Creek to a safe area. Although only 339 unharmed soldiers retreated, if there had been no order from Nanjing telling them not to make this pointless sacrifice, then these 300-plus men would undoubtedly have sacrificed themselves. There seems to be no reason to doubt this. This time, the isolated army's final resistance in Zhabei, even if it had no direct military purpose, their loyal and courageous spirit was sufficient to revitalize the declining morale and was of great benefit to China. China has been ridiculed for many years, and this is because most Chinese people embrace the philosophy of "wise men protect themselves," which has led to this. Ordinary Chinese people dare not harm their bodies and skin unless they see an excellent reason for sacrifice. They often think deeply and consider things to the extreme, which Westerners cannot understand. Now, the stance taken by the isolated army in Zhabei is sufficient to break the concept of "wise men protect themselves" and prove that Chinese people can move forward bravely when there is something worth sacrificing for to the extreme. Only Westerners who are familiar with the situation in China can know this, but they must reside in China for a long time before they can know the inside story. China's population is not as dense as that of the West, so its living conditions are not as focused on the concept of society as those of the West. In the past, the family was the largest unit of its society, and all individuals were immersed in family happiness. All of their mental and physical abilities were consumed by the family. They initially did not know that they also had a responsibility to care for the public outside the sacred small group. They had no feeling for the nation, which is commonly called "patriotism." This does not mean that China does not have this virtue. In fact, China has its own virtues, but it follows a different path. However, it is still easy to feel Westerners' healthy concepts. China is very willing to follow in the footsteps of the West in terms of national unity and patriotic spirit, as it clearly knows the need to adopt this attitude. However, not many people are confident that China has made this great progress. The spirit of the isolated army in Zhabei suddenly made an astonishing display, making people know that Chinese soldiers, who are often criticized, can protect the country with sincerity. If they are ordered, they are very willing to shed their last drop of blood to resist foreign invasion. This matter has made a very profound impression on the whole world and is sufficient to arouse the patriotic feelings of hundreds of millions of people. We and other sympathetic observers deeply believe that if they need to make a serious sacrifice, then these remaining three hundred-plus people will gladly sacrifice themselves. The highest command, therefore, does not want them to do this, as this kind of sacrifice will not achieve any military purpose and will be a pain in everyone's conscience. Only those extremists would want this.</p>
<h3>An American Woman Describes Her Journey From Shanghai to Beijing</h3>
<p>Chinese People Everywhere Show Resolve and Courage to Resist the Japanese; Railway Workers Maintain Traffic and Absolutely Do Not Fear Threats; The Number of Injured People Is the Largest She Has Ever Seen</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, an American woman who arrived in the capital a few days ago said that from beginning to end, everything she saw along the way was sufficient to demonstrate the Chinese people's resolve and courage to resist the Japanese. Even those lying on stretchers never groaned or complained. The stretchers were carried by exhausted Boy Scouts. There were several such instances passing by her. She departed from Shanghai on October 23rd. A trip that usually takes five hours by express train took 44 hours this time. At times, it was extremely dangerous. When the train was near Suzhou, there were Japanese planes in the sky. This was two days before the Chinese army retreated from Zhabei. Although the Japanese planes tried their best to bomb and strafe the train with machine guns in an attempt to cut off traffic on the railway, the railway workers still maintained train services. The American woman arrived at the West Station and saw at least 2,000 refugees waiting for the train to depart. The train did not arrive at the station until an hour later. The organization in the station was very complete. All passengers stayed away from the station buildings to prevent Japanese planes from bombing the station and causing casualties. She did not see any assistance or blackmail. She saw black smoke rising from the buildings of the Commercial Press in Zhabei, like a volcanic eruption, as several Japanese planes were bombing the area. Stationmaster Wang was very hospitable and allowed several foreigners to board the train first when it arrived. When the train started, the moon was bright in the sky, making it very easy for bombing. The passengers were all terrified, but it was fairly smooth at first. Each station they passed was somewhat damaged, but they still worked as usual. According to a missionary in Hangzhou, the station there had been hit by bombs and caught fire, but the train still left before the fire was extinguished. Not long after, they suddenly heard the crowd shouting madly about planes. The train stopped abruptly, and the crowd jumped out of the doors and windows to escape. Looking up, they saw four planes flying towards the train. The ditches on both sides of the railway were quite deep and filled with water, leaving nowhere to hide. At that point, they could only wait for death. Fortunately, the Japanese planes did not take any action, probably because they had no ammunition left. The train stayed for thirteen hours, and there was a risk of encountering danger at any time, but the Japanese planes were busy bombing Suzhou, eight miles away, and had no time to look back. Since the American woman had run out of food, she got off the train and went to a nearby village to buy sesame cakes to fill her stomach and drank tea at the ferry crossing to quench her thirst. The water was clear and green, which refreshed her spirit. The shop owner and staff knew that she was an American woman and were very friendly. Later, the train continued its journey, stopping from time to time. Thirty hours after the train left Shanghai, it arrived in Suzhou. The station was almost without lights to prevent air raids. There were several hundred other passengers who crowded in from the windows and crevices, including many women and children. Although they were all exhausted, they felt very happy. The journey from Suzhou to Beijing was fairly smooth. Almost every station they passed had been bombed, and some were heavily damaged. The areas on both sides of the railway line were also victims of air raids. When passing through Changzhou, they saw two passenger cars that were almost completely destroyed. The nearby platform had become a pile of rubble, and there were a lot of bloody cotton pads. Several civilians who had been wounded in the war were bandaged and were able to board the train and continue the journey. After passing Changzhou, there were only a few false alarms. After the train arrived in Beijing, the American woman saw Boy Scouts carrying the wounded down. The American woman said that she had never seen so many injured people in her life.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Fly Over Defense Line; British Soldiers Open Fire in Self-Defense</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, at 10:15 a.m. this morning (the 2nd), when Japanese planes were heavily bombing the Chinese army positions south of the Suzhou Creek from Jessfield Road to Beixinjing, British soldiers from the Loyal Regiment, stationed on the roof of a high-rise villa in West Park, fired at the Japanese planes with Lewis machine guns, but did not shoot down any. The British soldiers did this to warn the Japanese planes not to fly over the British defense line. They fired four shots the first time, and then fired two more times because the Japanese planes flew back into the British defense zone. Each time they fired, the Japanese planes turned back. It is now believed that the Japanese planes did not return fire at the British defense positions.</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, four soldiers from the British Royal Ulster Rifles, who were defending the area between Jessfield Road and Rue de Saigon, were killed by bullets and several others were wounded last week. This dangerous defense position has now been handed over to soldiers from the Loyal Regiment. The Ulster Rifles will no longer defend the area and will leave Shanghai on November 25th, to be replaced by the Ninghan Light Infantry Regiment. The infantry regiment will arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong on November 23rd. The Loyal Regiment, which is defending the area, is using the West Park Villa as its headquarters.</p>
<h3>The Nine-Power Treaty Conference Opens; Various Groups Have High Expectations</h3>
<p>Upholding Peace, Truth, and Justice; Hoping the Conference Will Impose Collective Sanctions</p>
<p>Presidents of Five Universities</p>
<p>The presidents of the five national universities of China, namely Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica; Weng Zhirong, President of Tongji University; Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University; He Bingsong, President of Jinan University; and Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University, sent a joint telegram to the Washington Nine-Power Treaty Conference, scheduled to open in Brussels on the 3rd, urging it to take effective measures to curb Japan's aggression in China and to punish Japan's violations of international law and its acts of destroying China's cultural and educational institutions. The original telegram stated briefly, "We especially appeal to your esteemed conference to take strong and effective collective measures to stop Japan's aggression in China and to punish Japan's violations of international law and international covenants, the destruction of universities and other cultural centers, and the endangerment of world peace and culture."</p>
<p>Educational Organizations</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Association for National Salvation and the Wartime Service Corps of the Education Community issued a declaration yesterday regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, stating that since the September 18th Incident in Northeast China, Japanese imperialism has been reckless and unscrupulous. It has further bullied and oppressed our country, which has always loved peace and been the most benevolent, attempting to annex and destroy it, and realizing its consistent policy of dominating Asia. Recently, from the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident to the August 13th Shanghai Hongqiao Incident, the provocative actions and the various acts of seizing Chinese territory and destroying Chinese sovereignty not only reveal its ambition to dominate East Asia, but also tear up world peace treaties and threaten peace-loving European and American countries. In particular, this time, Japanese imperialism has used naval, land, and air forces to trample on China's economic and cultural construction, which has been striving for since the National Revolution. Hundreds and thousands of large, medium, and small schools have been bombed and destroyed, and countless intellectuals have sacrificed under enemy fire. This inhumane and civilization-destroying atrocity is intolerable to the world's public justice. We believe that the development of human welfare can only be achieved by guaranteeing world peace, and the most fundamental principle of guaranteeing world peace is to respect international treaties. Any country that destroys treaties and arbitrarily invades is an enemy of mankind. We have always trusted and adhered to the Five-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and we are looking forward to just condemnation and substantive sanctions. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference, convened based on the resolution of the League of Nations Advisory Committee, will be held in Brussels and will undoubtedly be based on the Nine-Power Treaty. Therefore, we in the education community hope that we can fulfill the obligations of the treaty, promote the spirit of the treaty, and maintain peace, truth, and justice. We are a nation that loves peace and values integrity. This all-out war of resistance against Japanese imperialism is to preserve human survival and international peace, and it can even be said to guarantee the dignity of the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations Covenant, and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Therefore, this tragic and magnificent, long-term war of self-defense will not be shaken or subdued by any circumstances. However, regarding this conference, which is based on the principles of the treaty, determines that the enemy is endangering human happiness and plotting world peace, we have unlimited hope for the peace efforts of our friendly countries. First, is to "respect the sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity of China." Second, "to give China the opportunity to develop itself and maintain a strong and stable government." Third, "to maintain the principle of equal opportunity for all countries in industry and commerce." Fourth, "not to seek special privileges in China that would hinder the rights of friendly nations." China's efforts over the past ten years are designed to and what China hopes from friendly countries is only to have the Nine-Power Treaty realized. Japanese imperialism, not only has it failed to abide by it, but it has also inflicted all kinds of cruel aggression on China, destroying these four principles without exception. Therefore, our demands on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference are: First, like the resolution of the League of Nations, declare Japan to be an aggressor and a treaty violator. Second, order Japan to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the treaty, withdraw all naval, land, and air forces in China, and abolish all pseudo-organizations that have undermined China's sovereignty, independence, and administrative integrity since the September 18th Incident. Third, any international treaties between Japan and any country that violate the principles of the treaty should be declared invalid. Fourth, if the treaty-violating country does not fulfill all the resolutions to uphold the treaty, the participating countries should, together with the member states of the League of Nations, impose collective sanctions with the most effective force, and, if necessary, use force to stop Japan's aggression in China. Fifth, the participating countries and the member states of the League of Nations should provide China with substantive assistance. Sixth, the content of the treaty should be expanded at this conference to make it more concrete and effective. Our only purpose is to implement the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, restore the original state of sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity, to establish a collective security system in the Pacific, to firmly establish it for world peace and for justice, and to provide a solid guarantee for the nation. At this conference, friendly countries should give brutal Japan the most effective sanctions, and we also hope that we will join hands with educators across the country, with the responsibility of intellectuals and with the spirit of non-submission and non-compromise, to unanimously advocate and promote the success of the conference and give the enemy a severe blow.</p>
<p>Press Association, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Press Association and three other groups sent a special telegram to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 1st, and translated it into Chinese and Western languages, distributing it to all sectors. The translated text of the telegram is as follows: To the Chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels, At the time of the opening of your esteemed conference, our associations solemnly request your esteemed conference to make a practical determination on the responsibility of the aggressor, and to plan practical steps, not only to assist China in continuing its war of self-defense, but also to stop Japan's aggression and thoroughly correct all illegal acts by Japan in China, so that international law and order can be maintained through collective sanctions, and world peace can be preserved on a just and stable foundation.

In addition to jointly sending a telegram to Brussels to advocate justice, the Shanghai Chinese and foreign women's organizations, the Chinese Women's Movement League, specially sent another telegram to the Chinese delegation yesterday, expressing their views.

<p>⊙Xinxiang After the bloody battle on the Zhang River inflicted a heavy blow on the enemy, the enemy troops in Hebei have not dared to invade south again. Most of the enemy forces that harassed Henan have been separately resolved by us. Only in Hongshacun near Fenglezhen and Nanlunzhang, there are still three to four hundred remaining enemies in each place, and they are all surrounded by our large army and can be completely annihilated soon. It is reported that a part of our army crossed the river on the 1st and advanced north. Although the enemy in Eastern Shanxi has recently invaded Niangziguan, there are still heavy troops guarding the dangerous passes on both sides of the pass. Our reinforcements are now counterattacking from Yangquan, and it will not be difficult to eliminate the enemy who entered the pass. Looking at the overall situation on the northern battlefield, the enemy, with limited forces, has to cope with such a vast battlefield and cannot allocate enough troops. Therefore, the units on each line are transferred from time to time, and the enemy soldiers are mobilized all day long, exhausted. Now that our forces are advancing on all fronts, the enemy has exhausted its strength, and the return of the situation to Hebei is only a matter of time. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

According to semi-official sources here, part of a certain army is now shifting south from northern Shanxi and joining forces with the large army concentrated in Yangquan to launch an offensive. The Chinese army believes that Taiyuan is related to the entire war situation in Shanxi, so the Yangquan line has decided to defend it desperately under any circumstances.

<h3>Korean Revolutionary Party Broadcasts to Concentrate Anti-Japanese Forces</h3>
<p>Final Victory Undoubtedly Belongs to China, Korean Nation Should Implement General Mobilization, Violent Japanese Collapse, Weak Nations Liberated</p>
<p>The Propaganda Department of the Korean National Revolutionary Party, in response to our country's war of resistance against Japan, explained the reasons for the withdrawal of our Shanghai troops, detailed the enemy's absurd actions and exaggerated propaganda, and awakened the oppressed nations of the world, especially the Korean nation directly suffering from the pain inflicted by the Japanese enemy, should rise up to resist Japan. Yesterday, it broadcast to Korean compatriots at home and abroad in Korean. The main points are translated as follows:</p>
<p>Dear 23 million compatriots, the Sino-Japanese War, which is now focusing the eyes of people all over the world, "especially our Korean nation, which is closely related to victory or defeat," has begun for two and a half months. In these two months, the sacrifices on the Chinese side have been many, but the sacrifices of the enemy are also considerable. Recently, due to the fall of Dacha, the Chinese army temporarily withdrew from Zhabei and Jiangwan, and the enemy seems to have won a great victory and made frantic propaganda. In fact, this is a shameless and absurd action. Because the Chinese army's withdrawal from Jiangwan and Zhabei is a strategic means and has no impact on the overall situation. Instead, it extends the front line, which is unfavorable to the enemy. The Russian "Daily News" said that the Japanese army's capture of Dacha this time extended the front line and strategically fell for China's trick. A reporter from a certain English newspaper also said that because the Chinese army withdrew from Zhabei and Jiangwan, the Japanese army's front line was extended, and the attack was less favorable than before. He also ridiculed the enemy's fragility and recklessness by saying that it took the Japanese army seventy-six days to occupy the North Railway Station. It can be seen that our observation is very correct. The reason why the enemy spent more than 20,000 casualties and consumed a lot of ammunition to desperately attack Dacha is due to the unfavorable situation in the North China war and the dangerous situation on the Soviet-Manchurian border. It attempts to quickly end the Shanghai war in order to concentrate on North China. However, the Shanghai war will not end until all the enemy troops who came to Shanghai are wiped out. No matter how evil it is, it can only promote its own demise. In any case, as long as China prolongs the time and can maintain it for a year, it is obvious that the enemy will collapse by itself. Judging from the evolution of this war, the internal chaos of the enemy, and the international situation, we can be sure that the fate of Japanese imperialism has come to an end. The time for the liberation of China and other weak Eastern nations has come. The Japanese imperialist's brutal war of aggression against China has made the Chinese nation, which has suffered from violence and oppression for forty years, unable to endure it any longer. It is determined to wash away all the past shame with the red blood of 450 million people and strive for the independent survival of the nation-state. The entire Chinese nation is united like iron, and everyone is determined to sacrifice for the country, regarding death as returning home, and bravely and tragically resisting to the end. We heard that when the Chinese army withdrew from Zhabei this time, more than 20,000 refugees fled into the concession. Someone said that you should have fled earlier. Why did you take the risk in the line of fire? They replied very excitedly, if we all flee, who will help the soldiers fighting in the blood with tea, meals, washing, and all the miscellaneous services? These few words are enough to make the general foreigners who have always looked down on the Chinese people fully understand the awakening and greatness of the Chinese nation. On the contrary, what is the situation of the enemy? Their people oppose the war of aggression, the soldiers do not use their lives, and even quite a few of the enemy's lower-level officers are unwilling to go to war and commit suicide on the way. The warlords and political parties squeeze each other, and the warlords and warlords also have conflicts of opinion. The assassination of Ugin Ichisei and the rumor that Araki Sadao is being monitored are all facts that show that the enemy is bound to perish in this war, and China will absolutely win. What is the reason for this? ㊀ Because this Sino-Japanese War is not a war of opposition between imperialism and imperialism, but a war of aggression in which Japanese imperialism has no end and wants to turn North China and even the entire China into its exclusive colony. ㊁ Following the prolongation of the war, the enemy country's economy is exhausted, and social unrest is becoming more and more serious. The various contradictions within the enemy are becoming more acute, and there is a great possibility of a large-scale civil war breaking out. Moreover, Japanese imperialism owns many colonies. Taking advantage of the opportunity of this war, it is an opportunity for the anti-Japanese revolutionary forces in Korea, Taiwan, Manchuria, and other places to raise their heads fiercely. These forces are all terrible forces that are enough to control the fate of Japanese imperialism. ㊂ Because Japanese imperialism is in the position of an aggressor in this war, the weak nations and peace-loving people of the world extremely hate Japanese imperialism. In particular, Soviet Russia, which has a vested interest, gives sincere sympathy and assistance to China. This is a fact that everyone knows. At the same time, China has no colonies at all. In the past, various parties and factions and military leaders with many different political views have already abandoned all political views at this time. Under the boiling anti-enemy heart and the excited national consciousness, the people are united and vowed to resist to the death. The unity of the Chinese nation is not something that any force can hinder or disperse. China has no worries at home and has international sympathy. Its victory is undoubtedly certain, and China's victory is our victory. The day of the revival of the Chinese nation is the time of liberation for the weak nations in the East. Therefore, all weak Eastern nations suffering from imperialist oppression should make organic connections and actively assist China in terms of material resources and manpower. In particular, we Koreans, who are directly oppressed by Japanese imperialism, must realize the general mobilization of the entire nation with extraordinary awareness and determination, regardless of men, women, old, or young. We must directly participate in the war and fight our enemies to the death. Rise up, compatriots, we believe that anyone with a Korean soul who does not want to live a slave life will not hesitate at this time. Our immediate tasks are: ㊀ No matter what party or faction, we must eliminate all political views and factional concepts, unify under one banner, and concentrate and strengthen revolutionary forces. In the face of such a powerful enemy today, what cannot be sacrificed for the nation-state? ㊁ All unorganized masses are organized and trained at the same time. Workers in factories, farmers in rural areas, students in schools, and merchants in cities should do their best from their respective positions and use various means such as riots, assassinations, and sabotage to disrupt the enemy's front and rear, causing the enemy's abdomen to be in trouble and collapse by itself. The final victory will naturally belong to us. If we are still not aware at this time, act as a pawn for the enemy, or secretly communicate with the enemy, then we are the public enemy of the Korean nation and also the shame of the Korean nation.</p>

<h3>French Authorities Send Troops to Protect Jiaotong University Refugee Camp</h3>
<p>The French military authorities stationed in Shanghai sent 40 armed French soldiers in two trucks to Jiaotong University at 2:00 PM yesterday to protect the women and children refugees in the civilian refugee camp established by the International Relief Society in the school.</p>
<h3>Public Single System Reform for the Money Industry</h3>
<p>Elimination of the Names for Large and Small Public Singles, Implementation Set for the 5th of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association held its 49th member representative meeting of the third session yesterday at 2 PM. Present were representatives from 46 firms including Fu Yuan, Fu Kang, Xian Feng, Heng Xun, Hong Sheng, and Tong Yu, as well as over 80 representatives such as Zhang Wenbo, Yan Dayou, and Xu Wenwei. Mr. Liu Wuqiao chaired the meeting and Ge Huaiqing served as the recorder. A. Reporting Items: ① Minutes of the last meeting's resolutions. ② October correspondence. ③ Approval for the National Salvation Public Bond Money Industry Fundraising Team to urge bond payments; it was resolved that members of the association would pay an additional 30% on top of the 20% already paid for the public bonds they had subscribed to. The deadline for submission was set for October 29th, and the funds have already been collected and submitted to Fu Yuan and Tong Yu for collection. The amounts from each firm have been compiled into a report and submitted to the main team for safekeeping and onward transmission. ④ Various reports regarding the reserve fund. B. Discussion Items: ① Proposal for public resolution on the October interbank lending rate, resolved at 4.5%, with interest arrears accruing. ② Proposal from the Executive Committee: The current practice of issuing large public singles for amounts of 500 yuan or more and small public singles for amounts less than 500 yuan for members of the association, and settling them daily with the reserve fund, is considered an unnecessary duplication of effort and a waste of procedures. It is now proposed to eliminate the names for large and small and instead issue one single, regardless of amount, including odd amounts, and settle them daily, which is considered more convenient. Is this feasible? A resolution was sought through discussion and was passed, with implementation set for the 5th of this month. ③ On October 6th, a joint meeting of the Executive Committee of the Association and the Executive Committee of the Reserve Fund was held regarding raising funds for comfort donations. A proposal was made to approve the letter from the Shanghai Municipality's Comfort Committee, which requested that the Association pledge 25,000 yuan in comfort donations for the northward comfort mission. A resolution was passed stating that since the comfort donations would be allocated among various organizations, it would be difficult to decline. Therefore, it was resolved that each member firm would donate 500 yuan, with the Association temporarily covering any shortfall, and a request for ratification was made. The ratification was approved.</p>
<h3>Residents of the Southern City Continue to Move Yesterday</h3>
<p>The City Remains Calm and Unalarmed, Moving Vehicles Still Follow One Another Endlessly</p>
<p>Since the enemy declared that they would launch a major bombing campaign against our defenseless Southern City, residents there, "considering the indiscriminate killing and brutality of the rabid enemy army, have temporarily moved to avoid unnecessary sacrifices." However, most stores on various roads have remained open for business as usual, and passersby are not in a state of alarm. Although it rained yesterday, moving vehicles at Laoximen, Xiaoximen, and Laobeimen were closely following one another endlessly. Around 11 AM, all kinds of vehicles became particularly congested, all heading towards the iron gates at the junction of the Chinese and French areas. The French Concession police authorities specially dispatched constables to direct traffic at various iron gates in Xuhui, Fenglin Bridge, Xie Bridge, Malong Road, Ximen, Nanyang Bridge, and Laobeimen. In the Chinese area, police officers, citizen training corps, and security teams maintained order. People carrying clothing bundles, luggage, and waiting in vehicles had to stand by for half an hour or an hour. Some petty thieves, seeing an opportunity, dared to take advantage by offering to help carry things at the iron gates, resorting to robbery and snatching. The French police, realizing the situation, dispatched a large number of plainclothes detectives to patrol and protect the area to prevent incidents.</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Forcibly Seize Our Rice Boat in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The United States Protests to Japan</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Press reports that Japanese sailors suddenly crossed the Suzhou Creek under the Wuzhen Road Bridge one afternoon and forcibly seized a rice boat that was unloading rice. Upon investigation, the boat was docked within the U.S. military defense zone. Commander Baumont of the 2nd U.S. Marine Brigade protested to the Japanese naval authorities. The commander of the Japanese naval landing force expressed sincere apologies to the commander of the 2nd U.S. Marine Brigade. According to reports, Japanese soldiers fired a shot into the air when they forcibly seized the rice boat. The Japanese military has not yet indicated that they will return the seized rice boat, so the matter cannot be considered closed. The Shanghai Times also reports that a second Suzhou Creek incident occurred at noon on the 6th. The incident occurred within the U.S. Marine defense zone. At noon on the 1st, several Japanese sailors forcibly seized a rice boat that was unloading rice on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek under the Wuzhen Road Bridge. They forced the boatman to unload the rice there. Subsequently, Commander Baumont of the 2nd U.S. Marine Brigade lodged a formal protest with Hasegawa, Commander of the Japanese 3rd Fleet. Hasegawa expressed sincere apologies for the incident, but the rice boat and rice seized by the Japanese military have not been returned to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek. Although the Japanese side has guaranteed that similar incidents will not occur in the future, the U.S. authorities cannot consider the case closed because the rice boat and rice have not been returned to the original owner. Negotiations are ongoing. Furthermore, Japanese soldiers fired a shot at the boatman unloading rice within the U.S. military defense zone. The U.S. authorities have also protested to the Japanese side regarding this point. The Japanese side claimed that the shot fired was not a live round. According to investigations, a Japanese sentry fired a shot at the boatman before the Japanese sailors crossed the Suzhou Creek and forcibly seized the rice boat, taking it to the north bank of the Suzhou Creek.</p>

<h3>Convenient Transportation for Passengers Between Qingpu and Shanghai</h3>

<h3>Mobilizing All Shanghai Children to Solicit National Salvation Savings</h3>
<p>Since the all-out war of August 13th began, the Shanghai YMCA has held a campaign to solicit national salvation bonds, with a goal of 100,000 yuan. It is said that the goal was already fully achieved a week ago. This time, the association has launched a campaign to solicit national salvation savings from 10,000 households. The opening ceremony was held on the 31st of last month (Sunday) at the association. The overall organization is divided into one hundred teams, each led by a team leader responsible for soliciting donations, with the goal of reaching one hundred households. Given the association's organization and fundraising spirit, the goal of 10,000 households should not be difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Before the campaign even started, it was said that the internal organization had already been completed. Each team leader was selected and appointed. From the list of team leaders, we found a child who was only nine years old, named Li Ersheng. Driven by curiosity, I couldn't help but visit her to see if this young friend could take on this fundraising responsibility.</p>
<p>When I went to visit her, she had just returned home from school, so we were able to have a thirty-minute conversation.</p>
<p>"My parents are very enthusiastic about soliciting national salvation bonds. This time, because members of the YMCA asked us to help, my father asked me to be the leader of a team," she began to tell me as if she were an adult: "But my ability is very small, and I'm afraid it will be difficult to take care of everything, but for the survival of the country, I can't worry about so much."</p>
<p>"So, how are you going to collect national salvation savings?"</p>
<p>"The maids in our house and the maids in our relatives' houses can all be solicited. Fortunately, it is one yuan per household, and a few cents a month can be saved from then on. As for our young friends, there are many, they can all participate in savings, and they can also help me to solicit donations."</p>
<p>"What do you say to them?"</p>
<p>"That's easy. This money isn't a donation. The savings are still our own. We can save money on the one hand and save the country on the other. This reason couldn't be better."</p>
<p>"Moreover," she continued, "my father allows me to buy savings every month. My own candy money is also included. This money will be my education expenses in the future."</p>
<p>"Do you go to solicit alone? Wouldn't your strength be too small?"</p>
<p>"My strength is certainly too small to go to solicit alone, but my father helps me a lot and goes to solicit everywhere. Also, my young friends can also help me to solicit donations. I think their parents will definitely help them and go to solicit donations in all directions."</p>
<p>"I think if all the children in Shanghai can work hard for this matter, maybe in the near future, it can spread everywhere. Wouldn't that be very effective? These things depend on the adults in society to lead us, to mobilize all the children in Shanghai, and to work hard to solicit national salvation savings."</p>
<p>From her remarks, we can see that we should mobilize all the children's parents in Shanghai, hoping that these parents will come out and lead their children to take on this urgent task, and promote national salvation savings to the upper and lower classes of people throughout China. This is the best way to cultivate children's national consciousness, and it is the only new force to create a new China.</p>

<h3>A Female Worker Dedicates Her Family to the Cause</h3>
<p>Comfort Art Exhibition Only Lasts Three Days - Please Purchase Tickets and Bid Quickly</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Comfort the Soldiers Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition, it has been about ten days, and the purchase of tickets and bidding has been very enthusiastic. Yesterday morning, a Cantonese woman in her forties came and gave 100 yuan in cash to the Boy Scout, stating that she was willing to donate half of her life savings to the soldiers on the front lines. The Boy Scout led her to the office for a detailed inquiry. It was learned that the woman's name was Wu Yuzhen, and she lived in the Zilaihuo Company in Nichengqiao. She used to work in a factory in Zhabei. Because she witnessed the tragic arson and massacre committed by the Japanese army when they occupied Zhabei, she was willing to donate half of her life savings to help the soldiers on the front lines bravely kill the enemy and avenge her compatriots. At that time, the visitors and staff at the venue were all in awe. They informed her of the rules of the venue and asked her to choose a painting. Ms. Hao did not care about the painting, but the staff chose a painting by Li Qiujun called Talented Women Sending Clothes to the Frontier as a souvenir. It is thought that the wealthy merchants and virtuous people of Shanghai must also be moved by this.</p>
<p>The Women's Painting and Calligraphy Association and the Chinese Drama Painting Association are also working hard in Shanghai. At this comfort the soldiers art exhibition, Ms. Li Qiujun took the initiative to call on everyone, and many people responded, including Madam Liao Xiangning, Zheng Shangyun, Wu Qingxia, Bao Yahui, Chen Huaqiu, Pang Zuoyu, Yu Danhan, Yuan Qingyao, and Yun Dinghui. Yesterday, the works of Yan Mofei, Ding Mubing, and Zhou Lianxia were also seen. The women in the boudoir were also enthusiastic and patriotic and did not want to fall behind. However, the exhibition will only last for three days, so please purchase tickets and bid quickly.</p>

<h3>City Boy Scouts Raise Over 30,000 Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Result of Efforts by Over Two Hundred Members</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Municipal Government launched a campaign for all sectors of society to donate and produce cotton vests for our frontline soldiers, the Boy Scouts Troupe of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce also took on the task of soliciting 2,000 items. However, through the concerted efforts of the troupe members, more than 30,000 items have now been raised, a remarkable achievement worthy of admiration. According to reports, the process of the troupe's donation of cotton vests is outlined as follows: The troupe's fundraising method started with its own members, with members diligently soliciting donations from households in their neighborhoods or companies and organizations where they worked. Family members of the troupe members were also involved in production. It is also reported that foreign women, such as Mrs. American Yue Di, personally made and donated ten wool shirts. As a result, 17,382 items were donated, along with 3,237 yuan and some change in cash. In total, more than 30,000 cotton vests were produced. Each cotton vest had a cloth label sewn on, with inscriptions such as "Return My Rivers and Mountains," "National Hero," and "Serve the Country Loyally" to bravely kill the enemy, and the names of the producer and fundraiser were noted. After the troupe's efforts to promote this, overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia and people from all over the country have adopted this cloth label method. The troupe member with the best results was Qin Zhongyao, who contributed 1,873 items. There were more than 30 other people who donated more than 900 items. The troupe has only over two hundred members, and they all carried out the fundraising after their service hours, so it is truly rare to have such amazing results.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Implement Economic Severance with Japan</h3>
<p>Central Bank Stops Listing and Trading Japanese Exchange Rates; Japanese Banks' Bank Drafts and Checks are Rejected</p>
<p>After the banking and money shop industry association announced the implementation of economic severance with Japan, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned yesterday from the banking and money shop industry association that: (1) Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, banks have automatically stopped all dealings with Japanese banks. At the same time, the Central Bank stopped listing and trading Japanese exchange rates. (2) Money shops have no direct dealings with Japanese banks. Now, Japanese banks' bank drafts, checks, etc., have been rejected. In addition, the Japanese banks in Shanghai are: Zhengjin, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Taiwan, Sumitomo, Korea, Shanghai, Hankou, and eight others. The Chinese employees they hired have resigned automatically. As for the banknotes of Japanese banks, they have long been rejected in our country's market. ×××</p>
<h3>Various Aspects of the Fallen Capital</h3>
<p>— Zhu Jingxin</p>
<p>A Record of Seventy-Odd Days of Observations</p>
<p>(1) Severance of External Communication</p>
<p>Beiping is the hub of the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Beining railway lines. After the Lugouqiao Incident, the Pinghan line was the first to be interrupted. The battle in Langfang immediately cut off the Beining Railway, and traffic was immediately interrupted. When the Pingjiao army fought, the Pingsui traffic was also suspended. The traffic between Beiping and the outside world was completely isolated. At that time, only the Pingmen branch line (Beiping to Mentougou) was still passable. On July 29, Song Zheyuan went to Pingguomen and transferred by car to Changxindian. The Japanese army also tracked him to Baoding. They threw cards and stationed troops in Mentougou. The Pingmen branch line was also obstructed. The traffic around the city of Ping was cut off, and food and fuel sources were cut off, causing panic. Subsequently, the Maintenance Committee was established, and after coordinating with the Beining Railway Bureau and negotiating with the Japanese military, it first sought to restore passenger and freight traffic between Pingjin. After several compromises, it was approved. Every morning, Pingjin opened a pair of trains. Passengers from Ping to Jin were extremely crowded, and Japanese military vehicles were endless along the way. At each station, they had to wait for the train for ten minutes to one or two hours. The entire journey was only 240 miles, and it took more than twelve hours. The Japanese also carried out strict inspections at Beiping Qianmen Station, Yongdingmen Fengtai, and other places. The most attention was paid to military students and people related to the Party and government shares. If there was any disagreement, they would be detained. Even the aviation caps worn by young children were considered border violations. Each time the train arrived at the station, at least fifty passengers were detained and taken to the Ning Bing detachment for interrogation. The Beiping-Tianjin section of the Dongbei was also realized. At present, the entire line has direct express trains from Ping to Shenyang, which depart once every day at 12:30 noon, and trains from Pingjin to Jin Yutong, which also depart once every morning. Those who could not bear the brutality of the Japanese went from Ping to Jin, and took a boat to Qingdao and Shanghai. This line has become the only channel for North-South transportation. The Pingsui Road was interrupted at the end of July and then entered a military period. In order to facilitate transportation, the Japanese repaired the tracks with transportation soldiers. There is no definite news about passenger and freight cars. Only the Pingmen Line was reopened last month to facilitate the transportation of coal, and it runs twice a day, specializing in fuel transportation and not selling passenger tickets. As for the Pinghan Road, it has not been restored since it was interrupted. At present, Japanese troops are sent to guard along the stations.</p>
<p>In terms of aviation, the air routes of China Aviation and Eurasia Airlines were suspended after the incident. The Huitong Company, which was established during the Jicha Political Committee, was originally intended to facilitate the connection between Tokyo and Beiping. After the incident, all the airports were occupied by the Japanese army and used as bases for bombing North China. Every day, thirty to fifty enemy planes flew in groups, hovering in the sky, and all air traffic was cut off. After the Ministry of Transportation opened the nine-province long-distance telephone call, the connection between Ping City and various parts of the South was extremely convenient. At the same time, wired and wireless telegrams were also very developed. After the Japanese army occupied Beiping, the telephone lines were completely cut off, and the generators of the radio stations were seized by the Japanese. People were sent to monitor the telegraph bureau, and telecommunications traffic was suspended except for local calls. Recently, the Japanese repaired the long-distance telephone lines, but only Beiping and Tianjin Japanese Concession could talk. Wired electricity is also limited to reporting to Northeast China and Japan. The Tianjin Muyou Office set up a telegraph bureau on Dongmalu, specializing in receiving and sending telegrams, but the inspection was extremely strict. Beiping Post Office was also seized by the Japanese recently. Postal items (letters, packages, etc.) must be strictly inspected. Coupled with the inconvenience of transportation, the delivery of postal items is extremely slow. Express letters sent from Ping to the outside world only needed to be sent from the car five minutes before departure in the past, but now they must be sent thirteen hours in advance for the Japanese to inspect and approve before they can be delivered.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese Ruling Policy</p>
<p>After the Japanese army entered the city on a large scale on August 7, they first suppressed the anti-Japanese forces. Ruan Xuanwu's troops were disarmed, and there were more than 10,000 police and security teams with a large number of rifles and pistols. In addition to removing the security team leader who was a military officer, Pan Yugui was ordered to hand over all the police guns and transport them to the barracks of the country in Dongjiaomin Lane for preservation. The private possession of guns by the people was also limited to hand over to the government within three days. At that time, about 10,000 guns of various types were obtained. At that time, the police only relied on short sticks to maintain order. Therefore, robberies occurred endlessly during the day. The police could not intervene even if they saw it. When it affected the residences of Japanese and Korean people, the Japanese felt that their own safety was in danger. Therefore, they especially considered returning a part of the guns. According to the number of police districts, each district was given 50 rifles and 10 pistols, and each branch was attached with ten bullets. They were also instructed not to open them without reason. Even when necessary, they should first ask for approval before firing. Therefore, although a small number of police officers carry guns now, they are actually not much different from those without guns.</p>
<p>The national flag, party flag, party emblem, party card, and books such as the Three People's Principles were strictly prohibited after the Japanese army entered the city. The portraits of the Prime Minister in public places such as government offices and schools were all destroyed. The Japanese instigated the police to strictly investigate party affairs personnel and those involved, and regarded them as communists and Blue Shirts. They even encouraged citizens to report them, resulting in false accusations being heard every day. At that time, a book of the Three People's Principles was the evidence to constitute this crime. Xie Zhenping, the director of the Weiniu Bureau, who was crowded with prisoners in the Japanese military police headquarters, prepared epidemic prevention vaccines in Tiantan to prevent the epidemic. The Japanese army believed that they were manufacturing germs, and suddenly accelerated the arrest and detained him for two months before releasing him. There are even more people in prison who do not know what crime they have committed. Life and property have no protection. Except for traitors, no one dares to guarantee their own safety. The residences of central and local officials and soldiers residing in Beiping were inspected and arrested by the Japanese military police every day. The property management committee organized by traitors claimed to manage the property of important people and return it when they return to Ping in the future. In fact, there is no guarantee, and it is confiscated invisibly. The lives and property of the people have no protection. Japanese special agencies, military police, and military departments can issue orders at any time, arbitrarily inspect and arrest people. Even Japanese and Korean ronin, under the pretext of searching, no one dared to provoke the rebellious elements who forcibly demanded money. Japanese military vehicles drove on the streets every day, ramming into crowds. There must be several people who died tragically on the wheels of the Japanese every day, and there is no place to complain.</p>
<p>Our compatriots are in a place of lewd power, suffering from destruction, and the Japanese rule implements a high-pressure policy, so everyone dares to be angry but dare not speak. There is another group of Japanese who pretend to buy people's hearts and establish the so-called Shifu Headquarters. They also set up offices in various cities, with Japanese people who are proficient in the situation in our country as the chiefs, and third- and fourth-rate traitors as the deputy chiefs. They also invited local traitorous businessmen and local tyrants to establish the Yinfu Committee, using words to promote the virtues of the Japanese army, and occasionally solving disputes for the citizens. They must also be able to take effect under the condition that the Japanese side is not harmed. In fact, it is just to lure our country's Zhou people for the Japanese side and make them follow the example.</p>
<p>(3) Implementing Slavish Education</p>
<p>Beiping is known as the city of culture and education, and the student movement has always been active, which has long been hated by the Japanese. This time, the Japanese army entered the city, and the cultural institutions were destroyed. National schools such as Peking University, Normal University, and Peiping University were all changed into military camps, and the faculty and staff fled. The items in the school were destroyed without leaving anything. Students from various schools were arbitrarily arrested and killed. (After the troops stationed in the law school withdrew, the school collected the houses and found three students stabbed to death with bayonets.) However, it was during the summer vacation, and most of the students returned to their hometowns. Even a part of them fled Beiping after the incident. At present, except for Yenching University, which is still open as usual due to church relations, the others have been suspended.</p>
<p>There are many middle schools in Ping City, and private schools are subsidized by the government. After the incident, because of the small number of students and the lack of funds, most of them were suspended in an invisible way. Occasionally, a small number of schools that use the tuition fee as their monthly fee reluctantly open, and there are few students. Elementary schools and public schools are forced to open classes. Those in the textbooks that promote national consciousness and anti-Japanese thoughts are deleted and changed by the Maintenance Association's Cultural Group and the Social Bureau's Education Section. The special line of elementary and middle school textbook review committee reviews and deletes them one by one, and originally intends to reprint them. Because they were in a hurry, they temporarily cut and posted them for application. All the national flags related to party righteousness, the country, and the nation, as well as the blue sky, white sun, and red earth, were deleted.</p>
<p>There have also been great changes in the curriculum. Party righteousness has been completely cancelled. The Japanese also ordered the police bureau to discuss, and each school was forbidden to teach party righteousness. In addition, civics must be self-cultivation, military training, military nursing, and Boy Scouts were changed to martial arts, and a Japanese language course was added, forcing students to attend classes in order to cultivate traitors who have no national consciousness, and in the future, they will become their active puppets.</p>
<p>The Japanese severely cracked down on past student movements. At the same time, they created a pseudo-student organization, bought a group of shameless students with money, and forcibly pulled classmates and non-students to organize the so-called North China Student Federation. However, the appeal was very weak, and only a dozen people joined the extravagance. At the opening ceremony, the Maintenance Association ordered the principals of each school to bring students to attend. At that time, there were only hundreds of primary school students. The entire team was in the auditorium, and the speeches were all clichés. Those who spoke extravagantly had no impression on the listeners, and it turned into a slippery show.</p>
<p>The Japanese intend to fundamentally cancel higher education. However, general literati and traitors covet the beautiful names of the principals of various schools, so they also organized the North China Education Federation to replace the highest educational organ. However, the Japanese do not actively maintain this, it is just an empty institution.</p>
<h3>Sugar Industry Association Resolves on Public Sale of Japanese Sugar</h3>
<p>Organizing a Public Sales Office for Centralized Sales; More Than 40,000 Bags of Japanese Sugar Stored in Warehouses</p>

Article 4: This public sales office needs working capital such as tax payments and expenses, and each bag of Japanese sugar sold by the industry through this office shall be subject to a commission security deposit of one yuan in national currency.

Article 5: This public sales office shall settle the funds obtained from the sale of the Japanese sugar in stock once a month. In addition to deducting national salvation bonds in accordance with the regulations of the National Economic Severance Committee against Japan, it shall be returned at the time of purchase. Article 6: The various expenses related to the extraction of Japanese sugar entrusted by the industry to this office for public sale shall be borne by the original owner of the goods and deducted from the repayment of the capital by this office. Article 7: If the warehouse receipts submitted by the industry for the public sale of each brand of Japanese sugar cannot be delivered or there is a shortage, the loss shall be borne jointly by the industry stored in the warehouse. Article 8: If this public sales office incurs a loss, it shall be based on the amount of sugar entrusted by the industry to this office for public sale, with each bag as one share (excluding the shortage) to be recognized in proportion to the shares. Article 9: This public sales office shall be dissolved after selling all the Japanese sugar registered by the industry. Article 10: If there are any matters not covered in these simple rules, the public sales committee may decide to implement them at any time. Article 11: The detailed rules for the operation of this public sales office shall be formulated separately. Article 12: These simple rules shall be implemented after being passed by the general assembly and sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for filing. According to a reliable survey by Xin Sheng News Agency, as of August 13, there were still 43,836 bags of Japanese sugar stored in warehouses.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Run Rampant, One Family Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Seven or eight miles away from Nanxiang, there is a place called Gejia Village. Since the Shanghai war, its family members have long fled due to war terror, leaving only an old woman with a child to guard the house. On the 24th of last month, when enemy planes were rampant, they saw that the house was tightly closed, so they dropped a heavy bomb, which knocked down the entire house. The old woman and the child were killed, and the state of their flesh and blood was really unbearable to look at.</p>

<h3>Brief News on National Salvation Work</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Wartime Service Corps of National Jinan University students has spared no effort in its work. The publicity team held a Great Shanghai Defense Movement yesterday, and divided into teams to promote speeches in various parts of the city. In addition to continuing to raise cotton vests and gloves, the fundraising team divided the school into internal and external teams, and immediately began to solicit national salvation bonds.</p>
<p>The members of the Shanghai Painting and Calligraphy Circles recently held the inaugural meeting of the Shanghai Painting and Calligraphy Circles National Salvation Association on the third floor of Guanshengyuan on Nanjing Road. More than 30 people, including Shen Xinhai, attended the meeting. Shen was elected as the chairman and Ying Yeping as the recorder. After Chen Xinlu reported on the preparations, the association's charter was passed, and Shen Xinhai, Tian Jiwei, and Dai Chunfeng were elected as directors. It was also decided to hold the first board meeting at 2 pm on the 7th at the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, No. 16 Longmen Road.</p>
<p>The Chinese Medical and Pharmaceutical Circles National Salvation Association organized a propaganda team yesterday, led by Tian Xukai and Jin Jian, to go to various wounded soldiers' hospitals and refugee shelters to give speeches on the significance of defending Great Shanghai and the propositions on the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. They also posted slogans and propaganda in teahouses, restaurants, alleys, and other places. Although it was raining heavily, they did not slack off in their work until they returned at about 6 pm.</p>
<p>Since its establishment last month, the Sports Circles National Salvation Association has been working to appeal to various countries to refuse to participate in the 1940 Olympic Games in Tokyo and to expel Japanese members. The Hongkou Cross-Country Team is preparing to respond. The team leader Liang Yaoting has registered with the association and has issued a second notice to all members to report on time.</p>

<h3>Germany and Italy and the Far East Incident</h3>
<p>— Hu Nianzhi</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty Conference will be held in Beijing today. The success or failure of this conference depends on the attitude of the major countries towards the Far East issue. The diplomatic strategy that our country adopts in this conference also depends on the attitude of the major countries. Therefore, at the beginning of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it is indispensable to review the attitudes of the countries.</p>
<p>Since our country launched the anti-Japanese war, the sympathy of the governments and peoples of the friendly countries for China can almost be said to be completely consistent. Whether it is Britain, the United States, France, or the Soviet Union, although the degree of sympathy is different and the pace is inconsistent, there is absolutely no difference in opposing Japanese aggression. Among the so-called "friendly countries," we feel uneasy; only two countries, Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Until recently, we all recognized Germany and Italy as our friendly countries. However, since Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact last year, we have had to be wary of Germany, this friendly country. Although the German government stated that it would not apply to China when the Anti-Comintern Pact was signed, we must be wary of the allies of our enemies.</p>
<p>Germany did not attend the Beijing Conference. According to the German official explanation, if Germany were to attend the Beijing Conference, it would have to defend Japan, which would inevitably cause dissatisfaction in China, so it simply did not attend to avoid being in a dilemma. Germany's attitude has shown that Germany sympathizes with the aggressor. In addition, since August 13, German newspapers have repeatedly defended Japan, saying that Japan's actions in China are aimed at anti-communism and preventing red. Unexpectedly, our friendly country Germany actually colluded with Japan and falsely accused China of the Three People's Principles as "red." In any case, we cannot but admit that this statement by the German newspapers is an unfriendly expression to our country.</p>
<p>What is even more worthy of our attention these days is the news spread by the enemy that the German Ambassador Tao Deman is now mediating the conflict between China and Japan. At the same time, the German financial tycoon Luther arrived in Tianjin and gave a speech to the Japanese Allied News Agency, advocating cooperation between Japan and Germany to develop North China. We hope that these two messages spread by the Japanese side are completely rumors. If not, these actions of Germany are not only an unfriendly expression to China, but also a terrible conspiracy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Italy's attitude in this Sino-Japanese war is no better than Germany's. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's article published in the newspaper even publicly sided with Japan. Although Italy attended the Beijing Conference, according to the newspaper reports, its only role was to defend Japan's position. What makes us most sad is that Italy is preparing to join the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact at the time of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. It turns out that Italy has decided to sacrifice its friendship with China for the sake of cooperation with the aggressor country in the Far East.</p>
<p>Italy is a fascist country, and Germany is also a fascist country. Although fascism is incompatible with the Three People's Principles, we will never oppose Germany and Italy because of this. We believe that there is only the opposition between the peace group and the aggression group in the world today. The opposition of the so-called ideological group does not exist at all. Even if it exists, China will never participate in the struggle of the ideological group. China is unwilling to participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact for this reason. But no matter whether it is a fascist country or a democratic country, if it helps our enemies, falsely accuses our national system, or even colludes with aggressor countries to share the spoils together, that is definitely not something we can forgive.</p>
<p>In the middle of the war of resistance, our country only recognizes Japan as our enemy, and we are willing to get along with all other countries in a friendly manner. But among all the "friendly countries," we should be able to distinguish. Treating everyone as an enemy is tantamount to condoning the real enemy. But treating everyone as a friend is tantamount to not having a friend. In the middle of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, whether in diplomacy or in public opinion, we must have this clear understanding.</p>
<h3>The Towns in Western Shanghai are Peaceful</h3>
<p>Xujiahui and Caohejing are as Quiet as Usual; Hongqiao Town Has Been Bombed Repeatedly and Suffered Damage</p>
<p>After our right-wing front moved westward, people in Shanghai had many rumors about the recent situation in the western suburbs. In fact, the towns are still peaceful, and the residents are working as usual. Xujiahui Town is located at the junction of China and France. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the French authorities have set up barbed wire on Haige Road. The market in the town is also lively. Although there are enemy planes reconnaissance and distributing leaflets, there is no other danger. The people in the town are calm. Since the front line moved, Caohejing Town has been visited by enemy planes from time to time. Fortunately, the town is small and sparsely populated, and it is not militarily important. With the close maintenance of the local authorities, the shops are still operating as usual, and it is as quiet as usual. Since Hongqiao Town was repeatedly attacked by enemy planes, most of the residents in the town have fled. Recently, because it is closer to the Beixinjing Zhoujiaqiao front line, enemy planes have been bombing continuously in recent days. The rumbling sound shakes far and wide. Countless gun and cannon marks have been added to the broken walls and ruins of the town that were bombed earlier.</p>
<h3>銀錢業內匯發展貸款收買農產</h3>
<p>The remittance business within the city's banking and financial circles has become increasingly active due to the relocation of various important industries to the interior and the return of people from various provinces and cities in Shanghai to their hometowns to seek a living. As a result, capital is flowing into the interior. Various banks and financial institutions are planning to establish branch offices and representative offices in the interior to meet the needs. Additionally, the climate this year has been favorable, with timely and adequate rainfall, resulting in bumper harvests of agricultural products in various regions. However, due to enemy aircraft bombing everywhere, the enthusiasm for purchasing agricultural products such as cotton has decreased compared to the past. Currently, in order to regulate the rural economy and facilitate the flow of food and daily necessities, it has been decided that the various inland branch offices and financial institutions should provide as much loans as possible to support industries and businesses in purchasing agricultural products. According to a Xin Xin She reporter, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are currently implementing planned loan programs in various regions. The Agricultural Loan Bureau is actively promoting agricultural association loans, marketing loans, and agricultural product mortgage loans, and is preparing to store large quantities of agricultural products to meet the needs of the long-term war of resistance.</p>

<p>Currently Seeking Ways to Send Them Back to Their Native Places</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, overseas Chinese in Tokyo have been arbitrarily abused by the Japanese, making their lives unbearable. Yesterday, another fourth group of over a dozen overseas Chinese small businessmen returned to China from Japan. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau escorted them to the Relief Committee of the Five Counties' Fellow Association of Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jinli, and Yangzhong for assistance. As the association had already sent all of its refugees back to their hometowns and lacked ships for transportation, they are currently actively seeking ways to send them back to their native places.</p>

<p>The Golden Star Fountain Pen Factory in the city was once forced to shut down due to the impact of the August 13th Incident. Considering the need to pay attention to rear-area production and the livelihoods of its employees during this long-term war of resistance, the factory had no choice but to strive to resume production. It resumed operations last month. It is reported that its production efficiency has doubled compared to before, and the quality of its products has improved.

<h3>慈聯會注意患病難民管理</h3>
<p>The Charity Federation Pays Attention to the Management of Sick Refugees</p>
<p>Sheltering 500 Refugees in Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The Charity Federation recently issued a notice to all shelters stating that, for the purpose of notification, each shelter should assign personnel specifically to manage sick refugees in order to avoid confusion and delay in treatment. The following points should be noted: 1. Registration of sick refugees: On the day of the medical consultation, the assigned personnel should pre-fill the registration form with the name, department, and other information of the sick refugees so that the doctor can examine them by name upon arrival, to avoid omissions and save time. 2. Dispensing medicine: Many refugees are illiterate. After preparing the medicine, the assigned personnel should immediately distribute it to the sick refugees and explain the dosage instructions on the bottle label in detail to avoid overdosing or underdosing. 3. Custody of empty bottles: After the medicine is finished, the empty bottles should be properly stored and returned to the medical section in a collection, in order to protect public property and prevent them from being used for other purposes. Furthermore, the association transports and shelters many refugees from war zones such as western Shanghai every day. Yesterday, the association's shelters dispatched trucks again, rescuing 490 refugees from areas such as Caojiadu and Hongqiao in western Shanghai, and sending them to the association's Dahong, Qingliang, Jincheng, and other shelters for accommodation.</p>

<p>An Unexpected Twist in a Robbery Case on Xinzha Road</p>
<p>Two Detectives Accused of Dereliction of Duty</p>
<p>At around 6 PM the day before yesterday, five robbers broke into the home of Xue Hongmao at No. 14, Lane 353, Xinzha Road, and robbed him of thousands of dollars worth of property. At the time, Chinese and Western detectives from the Xinzha Police Station arrested two robbers, Ni Chongqing and Tang Yuhuang, and recovered a portion of the stolen goods. They also killed a robber, known as "Little Tailor," and seized a handgun with nine bullets. The case was handed over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. However, detectives handling the case discovered that Chinese Constable Gao Xiaomin, No. 084, from Jiangsu Province, and Chinese Constable Li Shaoshan, No. 1994, from Jiangbei, who had apprehended Tang, had pocketed a portion of the stolen goods without turning them over to the police station, embezzling them for personal gain. The two constables were detained for investigation. It was learned that Li had taken gold jewelry the night before to Tu Wenji's pawnshop at No. 230 Avenue Edward VII, exchanging it for 145 French dollars. Gao had also exchanged a portion of the stolen goods at a pawnshop for 24 French dollars. Gao also confessed to finding 40 French dollars inside a telegraph pole at the corner of Qingdao Road. This morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, where the police station's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the case and filed charges against them under Article 129 of the Criminal Law for dereliction of duty, requesting that they be punished according to the law. Judge Chen Lin reviewed the case and questioned the two defendants, and then decided to postpone the hearing for further review.</p>
<h3>法租界新橋街兩刦案</h3>
<p>Two Robbery Cases on Rue du Pont Neuf in the French Concession</p>
<p>Da Xin Bookstore Suffers Significant Losses; Diners Rob Zhengxing Restaurant</p>
<p>Da Xin Bookstore, located at No. 15, Mai'anfang, Rue du Pont Neuf in the French Concession, is owned by Xu Changchuan from Taizhou. Xu, being wealthy, attracted the attention of robbers. At 6 PM on the first of this month, six robbers suddenly knocked on the door under the pretense of delivering a letter. They immediately pulled out weapons, demanding silence. One robber guarded the main entrance, while four robbers entered the house, driving the owner's family into a room and locking them up. They then ransacked the rooms upstairs and downstairs, overturning chests and boxes. They robbed 6,070 yuan in cash, a farmer's check for 200 taels of silver, and a diamond ring worth over 200 yuan, and fled in a chaotic manner. After the incident, the owner's family rushed out and shouted for help. Chinese Constable No. 541, along with three Western constables, were patrolling and saw a robber fleeing in a panic. They rushed to apprehend him, but the robber drew a gun to resist arrest. However, the bullet jammed and could not be fired. Chinese Constable No. 542 also drew his gun and fired a shot into the ground. The three Western constables apprehended the robber and seized his handgun. He confessed that his name was Zhao Kunrong from Wuxi and that all the stolen goods had been taken away by his accomplices. The police chief ordered him to be detained. At noon yesterday, he was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. The Police Department's lawyer, Chen Ming, explained the case and requested that the authorities apprehend the accomplices as soon as possible and investigate the case before proceeding with the trial. Judge Chen Shuoying questioned the defendant and ordered him to be detained pending further interrogation.</p>
<p>Two robbers suddenly entered Zhengxing Restaurant at the intersection of Rue de l'Avenue Dubail and Rue des Villas in the French Concession at around 8 PM the day before yesterday. They first had a meal and then went to the counter to pay the bill. The robbers then pulled out handguns and threatened the cashier, robbing all the cash, small coins, and copper coins in the counter and cash drawer, totaling over 30 yuan. They then fled in a chaotic manner. The owner reported the incident to the police station and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>兩路閘口機廠被燬</h3>
<p>The Lianglu Zhakou Machine Factory Destroyed</p>
<p>Unable to Operate, Employees Scattered</p>
<p>The Lianglu Zhakou Machine Factory of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways was one of the most important machine factories for the railways. Most of the locomotives and rolling stock on both lines were repaired at the factory. Since it was repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft, the machinery inside the factory has been almost completely destroyed, making it impossible to operate. As a result, the factory's employees have also scattered.</p>
<h3>市校未上課學生學費定期發還</h3>
<p>Tuition Fees for Students Not Attending City Schools to be Refunded Regularly</p>
<p>Municipal Bank Rushes to Process, Refunds to Begin on the 8th</p>
<p>Although the city's municipal primary and secondary schools have gradually reopened after the war, the situation is different in these extraordinary times. The Social Affairs Bureau has publicly announced that students who are unable to attend school may have their families present receipts to the original collection points to claim refunds for prepaid tuition and construction fees. However, many schools entrusted the Municipal Bank to handle the collection of fees, and the bank refused to issue refunds based on the original receipts due to procedural issues, causing the students' families to make futile trips. Recently, the Social Affairs Bureau, upon the request of the students' families, discussed the matter with the Municipal Bank and agreed on a solution, instructing the students' families to first have the receipts stamped by the original schools to prove that the students had not attended school, and then claim the refund from the Municipal Bank. After the solution was announced, the students' families flocked to the bank to claim the refunds. However, the branch offices that originally handled the collection of fees, such as the Ximen Branch, simultaneously moved to the main office at No. 66 Tianjin Road yesterday, causing great difficulty in handling the large number of people claiming refunds. After further discussions between the bank and the Social Affairs Bureau, it was agreed to publish a notice stating that refunds would begin on the 8th of this month to allow time to process the procedures. A notice was posted on the spot, and the students' families gradually dispersed.</p>

<p>Members of the City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Group Discuss Village Work</p>
<p>Organizing the People, the Future is Definitely Not Bleak; Hoping that Ambitious Young People will Go to the Interior</p>
<p>Since the full-scale war of resistance, the general public believes that the duties of the Boy Scouts are only to provide first aid or security. In reality, it is definitely not so. The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce Social Boy Scout Group has done its best to unleash the vitality of its great youth and has taken on many important tasks in the war of resistance.</p>
<p>On October 27th, the group, at the request of the ×× department of the ×× army, sent eight comrades, led by team leader [ ], to the countryside to take on rear-area work. They are currently stationed in the ×× village near ××. Yesterday, the reporter was pleased to meet one of their comrades, who spoke to the reporter about the situation in the village. In order to make the public understand the sacred work of the Boy Scout Group, the reporter has recorded the comrade's remarks below (the following are the comrade's remarks):</p>

<h3>渡河敵軍大部肅淸劉家宅殘敵卽可殲滅</h3>
<p>Most of the Enemy Troops Crossing the River Have Been Eliminated; Remaining Enemy Troops in Liujiazhai Will Soon Be Annihilated</p>
<p>Enemy Troops in Wujialu Were Attacked on Three Sides and Suffered Losses; Our Troops Hold the Fanhuangdu Railway Station, Confronting the Enemy Across the River; Fierce Skirmishes Continue on the Jiangqiao-Xiaonanxiang Line</p>
<p>This morning, the North China Daily News carried a strange report that our troops had withdrawn from Nanshi. This newspaper's reporter met with our military authorities this afternoon, who absolutely denied this, saying that Nanshi is close at hand, and the facts are there for all to see, leaving no room for concealment. Speculations and reports by foreign newspapers are castles in the air and are enough to confuse people. As for the front-line situation, our troops still have the upper hand. Although the enemy crossed the river in multiple directions, they were encircled and severely attacked by our troops one after another, and eighty or ninety percent have been eliminated. Currently, only a small number of enemy marines are entrenched in civilian houses in Liujiazhai, stubbornly resisting. Our troops are searching and clearing them out. The remaining enemy troops in Wujialu are more numerous and can be eliminated after being attacked on three sides by our troops for two days and nights of bloody fighting. The village is still guarded by our troops. As of this afternoon, the enemy has only been shelling from across the river and has not dared to attempt to cross again. Foreign newspapers also claimed that the invading enemy troops numbered from 8,000 to 10,000, which is also completely false. This newspaper's reporter personally inspected the end of Avenue Haig at western Shanghai this afternoon. At the time, the sounds of machine guns were dense, with occasional artillery fire. The British troops stationed there were calm. Our troops were still holding the Fanhuangdu Railway Station, confronting the enemy across the river. [ ] folded to Xujiahui. When inquiring about the war zone refugees, they also said that the invading enemy troops were being encircled and fiercely fought. Finally, the reporter went to Nanshi for a week-long tour. Everything was normal. Stores were open for business, and the police were maintaining order. Although those who had moved to the concessions were more crowded, most were still able to live and work in peace, without any panic. All of these are ironclad facts. The reports in foreign newspapers are truly unknown on what they are based.</p>
<h3>渡河敵軍已先後擊潰肅淸</h3>
<p>The Enemy Troops Crossing the River Have Been Successively Defeated and Eliminated</p>
<p>Only a Small Number of Marines are Still Entrenched in Liujiazhai; Our Troops Still Firmly Defend the Line Along the River on the South Bank; Enemy Troops Flanking Xiaonanxiang Repelled</p>
<p>The enemy on the north bank of the Suzhou River has been using artillery fire and smoke screens in recent days to forcibly cross the river, attempting to invade our positions on the south bank. After fierce attacks by our troops, the enemy troops crossing the river at several locations have been almost completely eliminated, leaving only a very small number of remaining enemy troops. However, the enemy's ambition has not died. From yesterday morning to noon, they dispersed their forces again, dividing them into multiple groups, and forcibly crossed the river. There were traces of enemy troops in various locations, including Chenjiadu from Zhoujiaqiao to Shenjihang Estuary, through Liujiazhai, Beixinjing Beach, Qujiaqiao, Wujialu, and Yingtou. Our troops were prepared and immediately dispatched troops to block and intercept them, attacking the enemy troops with a calm posture. Without waiting for the smoke screen released by the enemy to dissipate, they immediately fired densely with machine guns into the smoke screen. As a result, many enemy troops behind the screen were shot and killed. The remaining stubborn enemy troops continued to break through, leading to fierce fighting. The battle lasted until the afternoon, when the rain poured down, and the enemy's movement was hindered. Our troops took advantage of the rain and launched a fierce attack from the north of Lincoln Road, advancing forward. They cut off the enemy troops crossing the river into several groups, causing them to lose contact with each other and immediately surrounded them. Although the enemy stubbornly resisted, under the brave charge of our troops, the fierce battle lasted until dawn this morning. The enemy troops along the river were successively announced to have been eliminated and defeated. The defeated enemy troops scattered in all directions, with only a few hiding in the broken walls. Our troops are conducting search operations. In the Liujiazhai area, a small number of enemy marines have also fled into the broken walls and are stubbornly resisting. This newspaper's reporter inspected Avenue Haig this morning and found that our troops were still holding the west of the railway line. The sounds of rifle and artillery fire were intermittent, indicating that our troops were still firmly defending the line along the south bank of the river.</p>
<p>There are still fierce skirmishes on the Jiangqiao-Xiaonanxiang line. The enemy once attempted to flank Xiaonanxiang from Hujiasi, but was eventually driven away by our troops. The fighting north of Guangfu was relatively quiet.</p>
<h3>昨晚浦江兩度砲戰</h3>
<p>Two Artillery Battles in the Huangpu River Last Night</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Struck by Our Fire Emit Urgent SOS Signals; Military Depot at [ ]shan Wharf Also Shelled by Us</p>
<p>Our artillery positions in Pudong unleashed powerful firepower again at 8:15 PM last night, fiercely bombarding the enemy base in eastern Shanghai and the enemy warships in the Huangpu River. For a time, the rumbling artillery fire shattered the silence of the entire line. The enemy warships hastily opened fire to return the attack, so the surface of the Huangpu River was flashing with fire and the sound of artillery fire was dense, alarming the entire city. After ten minutes of intense fighting, a thunderous explosion occurred on the surface of the Huangpu River. It was confirmed that one of the enemy gunboats anchored at buoy No. 3 was hit by our shells, causing many casualties among the soldiers. The ship was in urgent need and emitted frantic SOS signals, sailing downstream to avoid our fire. However, our brave artillerymen continued to fire, and soon the enemy's ammunition depot at [ ]shan Wharf was hit again by our shells, penetrating from the top of the warehouse into the interior. The sound of the explosion was very loud, and the extent of their losses can be imagined. Our troops stopped firing after completing their mission. The enemy's artillery fire also gradually decreased. At 9:15 PM, the enemy warships tried to retaliate, first opening fire on Pudong. Our troops refused to remain silent and returned fire, and the intensity of the battle was even greater than the first. Both sides exchanged fire for about half an hour, and then the sound of artillery fire gradually decreased. Many of the shells fired by our side landed in the enemy's base areas in Yangshupu and Hongkou. Two places caught fire after being hit. The enemy warships fired a total of more than two hundred shells, only destroying some civilian houses and killing or wounding more than ten civilians. After that, the entire line was extremely quiet. At 11 AM today, enemy heavy bombers dropped bombs and bombed Pudong, and enemy warships took the opportunity to open fire, but it was very sparse. Our troops did not pay attention to it. The enemy fired a total of more than twenty shells, and then it became quiet.</p>
<h3>周家橋頑敵渡河被我殲滅經過</h3>
<p>Enemy Stubbornly Crosses the River at Zhoujiaqiao and is Annihilated by Our Troops</p>
<p>Releasing Smoke Screens to Cross the River; Surrounded on Three Sides, Not a Single One Survives</p>
<p>This newspaper's reporter recently met a commander who had just returned home from Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai. Talking about the anti-war situation on both sides of the Suzhou River, he saw bravery and valor. He said that the troops he led were currently stationed in a section west of Zhoujiaqiao. At 3 PM the day before yesterday, the weather was rainy and the artillery fire from both sides was fierce. The enemy's artillery constantly shelled around our defenses. Suddenly, on the riverbank,</p>
<p>Smoke Screens Scatter</p>
<p>It was difficult to distinguish across the river. Only the sound of footsteps came, knowing that the enemy had secretly crossed over to invade. I ordered my troops to disperse and take a three-sided encirclement, waiting quietly to kill the enemy. Initially, hand grenades were thrown at the pontoon bridge from a distance. Because the bridge was made of canvas, it was soft and did not explode. Then, machine guns were used to fire fiercely, and the enemy dared not continue to cross the river. However, those who had already arrived in Henan were about one company, more than 300 people. These people were the enemy's daredevils, charging and colliding, and their momentum was very fierce. In addition to sending several machine guns to guard the mouth of the ferry bridge, the troops on three sides,</p>
<p>Fiercely Charged and Killed</p>
<p>In terms of firepower, the two sides were evenly matched. Fortunately, our morale was loyal and brave, and we fought regardless of ourselves. After more than an hour of fighting, about 200 enemies were killed. The rest also rushed to build fortifications, relying on the fort to stubbornly resist. At night, our army once again attacked and suppressed, and the sound of killing shook the sky. The enemy fought and retreated, bridging to the riverbank ferry crossing, and there were only a dozen stubborn enemies left. Eventually, they were completely wiped out by our army. At this time, the smoke screen had dissipated, but it was seen in Hebei</p>
<p>Dozens of Corpses Were Left Behind</p>
<p>The enemy had retreated, but the ferry bridge had not been removed, as it was prepared for those crossing the river to retreat. How could the enemy have no hope of returning today? We immediately destroyed and reduced the ferry bridge. The bridge was made of several layers of canvas stitched together, which was quite strong and sturdy. The ends were tied to wooden stakes and tightened with screws. It was about five feet wide and could advance on four routes at the same time. The river in this section was relatively narrow, so its use was also convenient. Without fierce gunfire to stop it, 300 enemy soldiers could cross it within ten minutes. Now our army has seen through the conspiracy, and the defense is tight. Wherever there is a smoke screen, machine guns are immediately used to strafe, so that the enemy does not dare to move forward at the risk of death. Otherwise, it is not enough to dare to have the ambition to steal and cross.</p>
<h3>敵在天通庵附近築成臨時飛機塲</h3>
<p>The Enemy Has Built a Temporary Airfield Near Tiantong'an</p>
<p>It is confirmed that another temporary airfield has been built by the enemy near the China Brewery in Tiantong'an. As for the claim of building an airfield near the large stadium, it has been found to be untrue after investigation. The reason why the enemy has been so fiercely attacking Liujiazhai, Yaojiazhai, Zhoujiaqiao, and Jiangqiao Town in recent days is that on the one hand, they dream of going directly to Xinlonghua from here to cut off our Shanghai-Hangzhou road's transportation line, and on the other hand, they want to occupy our Hongqiao airfield in the southwest, so as to use it as a base for their air force. However, we have built strong fortifications and deployed significant forces in various places south of the Suzhou River. The enemy's attempts are doomed to fail.</p>
<h3>敵機又飛南市窺探</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Fly Over Nanshi to Reconnoiter Again</p>
<p>At about 9 AM today (the 3rd), an enemy seaplane flew over Nanshi and circled several times, reconnoitering back and forth in the area from the Bund to Gaochang Temple. At 10:15 AM, it did not drop any bombs and left.</p>
<h3>敵軍火運眞如附近</h3>
<p>Enemy Ammunition Transported Near Zhenru</p>
<p>For the sake of facilitating supply, the enemy has recently transported most of the ammunition and important military supplies originally stored in the warehouses and yarn factories in Yangshupu and stored them near Zhenru.</p>
<h3>敵艦運到飛機零件</h3>
<p>Enemy Warships Transport Aircraft Parts</p>
<p>The enemy's giant transport ship Hayatomo, which sailed to Shanghai yesterday, carried more than 500 boxes of unassembled aircraft parts. It docked at the Zhaoshangju North Wharf and began unloading ashore this morning (the 3rd). The enemy ship Chunjiumaru, which transported eight enemy seaplanes and a large number of bombs to Shanghai, set sail back to Japan last night.</p>
<h3>The World's Eyes Focused on Brussels for the Opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>The United States, Britain, France, and Belgium held preliminary talks yesterday; Chinese representatives prepared to elaborate on their solemn stance; Japan denied a willingness to accept mediation from other countries.</p>
<p>⊙Brussels: The Nine-Power Treaty Conference opened here at the Tongru Academy at 11:00 this morning. A total of nineteen countries are participating in the conference, and the list is as follows: ㊀ Eight original signatory countries, namely China, the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands, and Portugal, with Japan being the only one refusing to participate; ㊁ British Dominions and Territories, represented by the United Kingdom, including Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and India; ㊂ Five later signatory countries, namely Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Bolivia, and Mexico; ㊃ One non-signatory country, the Soviet Union; in addition, another non-signatory country, Germany, declined the invitation from the Belgian government to participate. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels: Today, the world's attention has focused on Brussels, as the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, attempting to resolve the Sino-Japanese War by agreement, will open here at 11:00 AM today (7:00 PM Shanghai time). It is understood that this conference has not established a rigorous and unchangeable procedure. The first step is to explore whether Japan is prepared to engage with the conference and whether Japan can state under what conditions it would be willing to cease hostilities. Furthermore, it is necessary to pre-determine under what conditions the Chinese government would be prepared to discuss peace. Only after the above prerequisites are met can the likelihood of a resolution be assessed. It is reported that after the opening of the conference today, the main representatives of various countries will successively deliver speeches, generally seeking mediation of the disputes. Furthermore, according to news from the Japanese side, the Belgian Foreign Ministry yesterday inquired with the Japanese Embassy whether it would be willing to send an observer to the conference venue. It is said that the Japanese Ambassador has replied that he does not advocate any contact with the conference. It is also heard that the Italian representative also visited the Japanese Ambassador last night for a long conversation. At the same time, the Japanese side denied rumors here that Japan is willing to consider British and American mediation. On the Chinese side, Mr. Gu Weijun broadcast a speech last night, stating that the main facts of the current situation are nothing more than the conspicuous violation of the Nine-Power Treaty by Japan, and that this violation not only involves China alone, but also has close relations with all other signatory countries. Furthermore, on the eve of the conference's opening, everyone's attention is focused on Mr. Davis, the US representative, who, since arriving in Brussels, has been busy contacting various delegations in an effort to draft a proposal. However, so far, all parties deny that any concrete proposal has been established. However, representatives of some countries said that after exchanging views as much as possible, the conference will adjourn and delegate the mediation duties to several countries. However, if the conference cannot make any decision on how to stop the Sino-Japanese War, it will at least be able to issue a declaration, reaffirming the dignity of the treaty and condemning acts of aggression. Although this declaration may not have practical effect, it can at least record in the moral realm the attitude of the participating countries against Japanese military actions. Furthermore, it is heard that the US representative Davis has modestly declined the chairmanship of the conference, and that the most popular candidate for chairman thereafter is Mr. Bruce, the Australian representative who previously chaired the Montreal Conference, otherwise it is proposed to elect from representatives of the Scandinavian countries. (Central News Agency, 3rd, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels: British Foreign Secretary Eden held talks with US Chief Representative Davis at 11:30 this morning. Mr. Hornbeck and Mr. Mofield, counselors of the US delegation, were also present. The representatives of the United States and Britain had lunch together at noon and continued their talks, which ended at 3:00 PM. Eden then went to meet with Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, while Davis held talks with Chinese Chief Representative Gu Weijun. Mr. Gu also visited French Foreign Minister Dalbos. At 5:00 PM, Spaak, Eden, Dalbos, and Davis held an informal meeting. It is reported that the results of the meeting have proven that the opinions of the four countries are in complete agreement, and future actions will also be consistent. In addition, although the Belgian cabinet tide has not yet been resolved, it is heard that Spaak has agreed to the request of the British, French, and American representatives to serve as chairman of the conference. In any case, Spaak will host the opening ceremony of the conference tomorrow as the host, delivering a welcome speech to the representatives of various countries and explaining the spirit and goals on which the conference is based. Then Eden, Dalbos, and Davis will successively deliver speeches, explaining that the opinions of their respective countries are in complete agreement. It is estimated that Chinese Chief Representative Gu Weijun will also speak after them. In short, the entire time of tomorrow's meeting will be devoted to speeches by representatives of various countries, and at the next meeting, all documents of the conference will be studied, as well as the views of China and Japan.

<p>⊙Brussels: This afternoon, it was rumored here that if some countries could come forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, Japan might accept it. Regarding this statement, the Japanese Embassy in Belgium said that it had not received any news from Tokyo. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Raises War Bonds</h3>
<p>First batch of 200 million yuan</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government, in order to cope with the Sino-Japanese war, feels a deep financial strain and has issued 200 million yen in war bonds, with the subscription deadline on November 6. The bonds will be repaid in seventeen years, with an interest rate of 3.5%. In December, another 500 million yen in war bonds will be issued. (Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>China Promotes National Consciousness, Unlimited Future</h3>
<p>French Historian Evaluates Far East War; China Will Surely Win Final Victory</p>
<p>[Paris] Professor Ju Yu, a famous historian at the University of Paris, recently published an article in 'Capital Weekly', stating briefly: 'The current struggle in the Far East cannot be judged by the military strengths of China and Japan. China has a population of 400 million. If it can fully develop its national consciousness, even if it cannot win victory at the moment, its future is truly unlimited. The progress that China has recently made has already been very significant. After being tempered by iron and fire, if its national consciousness becomes more and more developed and strong, then even if Japan occupies Peiping, Zhangjiakou, and part of Shanghai, and establishes buffer states in North China and Inner Mongolia, similar to what it has done in Manchuria, the final result will certainly not be Japan absorbing China, but China absorbing Japan. Since ancient times, foreign tribes have invaded China and been assimilated by China countless times. Conversely, if China's internal divisions resume after the war ends, Japan will not only be able to maintain its vested interests, but also be able to dominate everything in China, just as a small number of British people did in the vast land of India in the past. This will certainly not be a blessing for China.' Ju Yu continued that Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the late Premier of the Chinese Nationalist Party, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, created the Three Principles of the People, advocated equalization of land ownership, and control of capital. Since 1925, the prestige of the Nationalist Party has increased daily, the people's patriotic heart has been aroused, and China has been transformed into a modern country, all thanks to the Nationalist Party. For this reason, Japan believes that if it does not plan at this time, there will be no chance in the future. Specifically, with regard to the current war, the heroic and magnificent resistance of the Chinese National Army near Shanghai has shocked the world, and the barbarity of the Japanese army's methods of warfare and the cruelty of its massacre of civilians have aroused international indignation. The impact has attracted worldwide attention, so what was once considered a miracle has actually become a reality, and is very likely to happen. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Suffered Another Tragic Bombing by Enemy Aircraft Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 30 bombs were dropped in the urban area, destroying many houses and causing numerous casualties.</p>
<p>Songjiang, November 2nd telegram: This area has been repeatedly bombed by enemy aircraft. The city and its suburbs, as well as prosperous areas, have been completely destroyed. At around 9:00 AM today, two more large enemy seaplanes came and circled over the city for reconnaissance. After about an hour, they dropped three bombs along the Huangpu River and then flew southeast. At 10:25 AM, even though there was a drizzle in the sky, three enemy heavy bombers still flew over the city, circling for a week before dropping more than 30 bombs and then quickly flying back in the original direction.</p>
<h3>Residents of Nanshi Intensify Relocation Today</h3>
<p>After the enemy sent a notice to the consulates of various countries in Shanghai that they would bomb the undefended Nanshi area, residents of southern Shanghai, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, moved to the concessions one after another. This reporter personally went to inspect the three locations of Nanyang Bridge, Old North Gate, and Xie Bridge at 8:00 this morning. Vehicles for relocation and people moving were shoulder-to-shoulder and axle-to-axle. These three locations are the passages between the Chinese area and the concessions, and were therefore regarded by those seeking refuge as convenient routes. However, judging from the situation this morning, the so-called convenient routes were no longer entirely so. The authorities of the French Concession, in order to maintain order in the concession, require that relocation vehicles from the Chinese area must first apply for a pass from the Lujiawan General Patrol Room. Although such passes are never restricted, the sheer number of applicants requires a considerable amount of time, causing the relocation vehicles close to the Chinese area sections of the three above-mentioned passages to stop and not advance due to this reason, creating a very long line. Later vehicles continued to arrive, resulting in a situation where the section of Mingguo Road from Nine Acre Field in the west to Old North Gate in the east, and the section of Fangbang Road from Mingguo Road in the south to Nanyang Bridge in the west, were all seized. However, the situation at Xie Bridge was better. The steel mesh of the passages was forcefully cleared and maintained by Chinese police and French police respectively, so order was still good.</p>
<p>Nanshi has had no market activity since this morning, as most residents have fled. Therefore, in the small teahouses, only tofu stalls and the like are slightly embellished. It has been found that the current residents are mostly elderly, weak, poor people, people from churches, and disabled people from disabled people's homes.</p>
<h3>Italy, Germany, and Japan Anti-Comintern Pact</h3>
<p>Will Soon Be Signed in Rome</p>
<p>[London] Italy, Germany, and Japan will sign the Anti-Comintern Pact in Rome on November 6. According to the Soviet Union's News, if the above news is indeed true, 'this action cannot but have a considerable impact on Soviet-Japanese relations.' The newspaper also hinted that the Soviet Union might reject Japan's request to conclude a fishing treaty. Furthermore, the original text of the Anti-Comintern Pact is said to have been drafted, and according to reports, it does not contain any military clauses. The important clauses mostly coincide with the existing German-Japanese agreement, and the German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, is said to represent Germany in signing.

<h3>Japan Reforms Cabinet Structure</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The government is preparing to organize a wartime headquarters and at the same time reform the cabinet system, that is, to establish a new large agency within the cabinet called the Supervisory Bureau, which will supervise the administrative conditions of various provinces from a national policy perspective, and whether various administrative agencies have truly implemented the national policy guidelines determined by the cabinet. The fundamental reform of the cabinet system and the establishment of a new Supervisory Bureau seem inseparable. This is a landmark reform of the Japanese cabinet. The government leaders are also considering establishing an information bureau secretariat in order to decisively carry out the cabinet's major reforms. (3rd, Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Rumor That There Were No Troops Withdrawing from Nanshi is False</h3>
<p>Today's Shanghai-based North China Daily News reported that our security forces in Nanshi had withdrawn. According to this reporter's investigation, there have never been any troops stationed in Nanshi. All security has been maintained by the Self-Defense Corps with the assistance of the police station. What the newspaper reported is a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Bombarded Yanglinkou, Attempted to Land, But Failed</h3>
<p>Were Bravely Repelled by Our Troops; Enemy Ships Arrived Off the Coast of Hanjiang</p>
<p>[Changshu] At around 9:00 AM on the 2nd, the enemy again attempted to land in Yanglinkou in the rain, and used aircraft to provide cover and bombardment. After our brave counterattack, the sound of artillery and the sound of bombing occurred simultaneously. The sounds heard in the urban area here were very loud. After a fierce battle until noon, the sound of artillery gradually subsided, and the enemy retreated due to being unable to withstand the attack. (2nd, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Fuzhou] Five enemy ships have arrived off the coast near Hanjiang on the border between Fu'an and Putian, seemingly with ulterior motives. We are closely monitoring their actions. (2nd, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<h3>Phase</h3>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Is scheduled to be formally opened at 11:00 AM today. In the auditorium of the National Research Institute in Brussels. Therefore, at the time of this writer writing this manuscript. It is exactly the time when the heroes are 'discussing and generating wind' in Brussels. What the effect of the conference is. It is difficult to predict at this time. Perhaps quite pessimistic about the conference. Perhaps still hopeful about the conference. Mostly nonsense. I am not making such a 'prophet-style' guess now. What I want to say. Is a few factual issues.</p>
<p>The original Nine-Power Treaty was produced. Was signed to solve the China issue after the European War. It seems that the Nine-Power Treaty. Is entirely designed to protect our country's territorial sovereignty. In fact, since the signing of the treaty. How much of our country's territorial sovereignty has been invaded. And it is the country that is invading our country. That is, the country that signed the treaty to protect our country's territorial sovereignty.</p>
<p>The current situation. There are only two major front lines of war between aggressors and pacifists. It is definitely not just about a certain country and a certain place. Therefore, wanting to predict which front line will win or lose. That is, you can see whether that front line is united, consolidated, or loose. With this standard. Vaguely. Can be known.</p>

<h3>The Fierce Battle Against the Enemy at Guan</h3>
<p>Four enemy divisions crossed the river, suffering heavy casualties; our army held out for three days and nights with high morale.</p>
<p>Renqiu communication: Guan is located on the south bank of the Yongding River, east and west are less than a hundred miles from the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways, respectively. The left and right are in a crucial location being the communications center of the northern section of both roads. Since the ×××th Division took over the defense, it has actively constructed fortifications. In less than a month, the enemy has attempted to cross the river secretly more than thirty times, all of which were repelled. On the morning of October 13, the enemy crossed the river with four divisions, dividing into upper and lower reaches. With one and a half divisions, they launched a fierce attack on the Xiyu and Dongxi Yangcun crossing points on our left flank, with cavalry in the lead and infantry in the rear, followed by heavy artillery and tanks, advancing in four columns. Reaching the river bank, they spread to the left and right, forming a straight line, moving closer and closer, the area of the battle line became longer. At the same time, more than 30 aircraft provided cover, and destroying our position, artillery shells were like flowing beads. The soldiers of our ×××th Regiment, under this rain of bullets, smoke, and mist, remained calm and fought back. Enemy corpses were piled up, and the river was blocked. The fierce battle lasted all night. Finally, because the enemy's artillery fire was too fierce, we had no choice but to abandon the Xiyu crossing point. One and a half enemy divisions crossed the river from here. This meant that one hundred miles between Yongding and Daqing Rivers, and countless people were ravaged by the enemy.</p>
<p>After the enemy crossed the river, on one hand, they used the main force to advance south, attacking our positions in the Xianggezhuang area, and on the other hand, divided their troops to attack the city of Guan. At that time, the defending forces in the city were less than two battalions. After more than a thousand heavy artillery shells bombarded it, the northwest city walls were completely destroyed. Our loyal and brave soldiers still fought the enemy at all costs. Officers and soldiers of a certain company rushed into the enemy's position and killed an enemy tank, capturing an enemy propaganda captain and more than 20 soldiers. Eventually, they were exhausted and died together with more than a hundred enemies. Their loyalty to the country was truly remarkable.</p>
<p>When the enemy used their main force to attack our Taiziwu line, Zhao Wenzhi, commander of the ×××th Brigade, led the reserve team to reinforce it. They encountered the enemy, who rushed us more than ten times, with hundreds of machine guns firing at the same time. Commander Zhao was hit by two bullets, and he actually held the wound with one hand and directed with the other, standing still. Unfortunately, he was hit by two more bullets in the abdomen, and two knife wounds to the head caused him to faint and fall to the ground. Later, the enemy was repelled, and Commander Zhao survived. The intensity of that battle can be imagined.</p>
<p>After the enemy occupied our Guan County, they desperately advanced south, invading our second line of Jicheng Pengcun. Our ×××th Regiment continued to engage in battle, while the ×××th Regiment launched a counterattack from the left flank. Reinforcements from other regiments continued to arrive. The enemy was encircled, with each layer restricting the other, reaching a mixed battle situation. It continued for more than three days and nights. Our ×××th Regiment was still able to attack the enemy's rear, intercepting three tanks and driving the enemy back more than twenty miles. At this time, morale was extremely high, and it was possible to drive the enemy to the opposite bank of the Yongding River. However, the loss of Niutuo Town in the rear and the simultaneous pressure from the enemy on the left wing, coupled with the exhaustion of ammunition and the severance of aid, made it impossible to save this situation.</p>
<p>In total, the enemy suffered more than 7,000 casualties in this battle, including the death of one regimental commander, the destruction of four tanks, and incalculable losses of equipment. More than 60 horses and one regimental flag were captured by us. We suffered more than 120 officer casualties and more than 3,000 soldier casualties. The division has now retreated to Shimen Bridge, south of Renqiu County, and is reorganizing. ★★★</p>
<h3>Tragic Bombing of Bengbu by Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>A total of 78 bombs were dropped; more than 40 civilians were killed and wounded; more than 300 houses were destroyed</p>
<p>Anqing communication: Enemy aircraft bombed Bengbu on October 14, killing and injuring many innocent civilians, which was an unprecedented tragedy. It was found that at 4:45 PM that day, six enemy aircraft flew into the airspace of Bengbu city from the southeast, each dividing into three aircraft. They immediately dropped bombs continuously, and swept downward with machine guns. The high-altitude artillery fired upwards dangerously. The aircraft circled for about ten minutes and flew to the northeast. The Huachang Street, Nanyang Company, and Yunyang Building areas that were bombed caught fire, but the Bengbu Police Department's fire brigade tried their best to put out the fires, fortunately preventing them from spreading. The department also supervised police officers and defense group volunteers to send the injured to various hospitals for treatment and ordered coffins to be collected for the dead. Afterwards, the department conducted a detailed investigation and found that a total of more than seventy bombs were dropped by the enemy aircraft this time. As of the 15th, a total of 43 people had died and 45 had been injured. As for the bombed locations, 16 bombs landed at the train station, and 6 bombs were dropped at the Rotary School, bombing three locations, killing and injuring one coolie each, and injuring a total of sixteen people. The Railway Association's houses were destroyed. In addition, 11 bombs landed in the Shijiawa Village behind the Jiangsu Guild Hall, killing four women and eleven civilians. Twelve bombs landed in the northeast of the airfield, killing one resident of Xinma Road and destroying two thatched houses. Three bombs in the big pond of Bayi Garden, and seven bombs in the pond outside the eastern station's surrounding wall, none of which exploded. A total of 45 bombs were dropped in the eastern area and at the train station, killing 33 people and injuring 17. In the western area, in the Huachang Street area, a total of 23 bombs were dropped, including two in Zhizima Lane, one in Yuanyongyu Company, one in Deheli, one in Shanghai Bank, killing two policemen, Qu Xinshan, etc., and injuring one, two in Tongli, two in Yunyang Building, one in Yihe, one in Yifeng Yarn Factory Xinyuan Company, one in Dafeng Shun Chang, one in Wanxing, one in Chen Bingzhang's courtyard, one in Lianbaozhang Li Lingxiao's courtyard, one in Senchang Taichang, one in Fuxing Company, two in Qianhe Wenfang Hospital Gengyu, and one on the small train station road, killing one volunteer and injuring five, killing seven civilians and injuring twenty-two, killing two policemen and injuring one, for a total of ten deaths. In total, 43 people were killed and 45 were injured by the bombs dropped in the east and west. More than 300 houses were destroyed. The provincial government has ordered the department to properly handle the aftermath and comfort the families of the dead and injured civilians. ×××</p>

<h3>Seamen's Resistance Association Cables Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Ensure Peace in the Far East; Joint Sanctions Against Japan</p>
<p>The Chinese Seamen's Resistance Association cabled the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, saying, "To the Brussels Nine-Power Treaty Conference, since the Xinhai Revolution, our country has been striving for the construction of a modern nation in order to coexist with the nations of the world and jointly promote human evolution. For 26 years, with the assistance of various countries, it has progressed boundlessly, which is deeply appreciated by our people. However, neighboring Japan, although it is a country with the same culture and rights as us, due to its enemy power being controlled by the military, not only does not assist in our country's construction, but also seeks to destroy it. Recently, it has even tried to swallow our country and exterminate our race. Tracing back to the Twenty-One Demands, such as hindering our revolution, there was the Jinan Massacre in the 17th year. Destroying our tariffs, there were multiple demands to our tariff autonomy before the 19th year. For the past three years, it has assisted in large-scale smuggling, using consular jurisdiction, it has sheltered trafficking, supplied bandits, and established special agencies. Invading our land, there was the creation of 'Manchukuo', the support of the Hebei-Chahar puppet organization, and the invasion of Hebei-Chahar and Tianjin. Massacring our people, there were bombings of Shanghai, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, with deaths numbering in the thousands every day, and fleeing women and children were not spared. Blocking our foreign trade and destroying the economies of various countries in China, there was the announcement of the blockade of our 7,500-mile coastline. Saying that Japan still knows about treaties, the Nine-Power Treaty is a country that it signed, yet it dares to refuse to attend. Saying that we are intentionally excluding Japan and must defend ourselves, why has Japan's trade with China increased year by year in recent years, recently reaching the first place, and on the contrary, it is violently beating its buyers in the homes of its commodity buyers. Is the word self-defense explained in this way? All of these are facts, and the countries above and below are extremely clear. Therefore, there is the holding of the Brussels Conference, which upholds justice and respects our sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity. Our association represents the seamen of the entire nation of China, and makes the following requirements to the conference: ㊀ Lift the illegal blockade of our country's coastline by Japan, which will benefit the commerce of various countries. ㊁ According to the articles of the Nine-Power Treaty, fulfill the obligations to protect our country's sovereignty, territorial and administrative integrity. ㊂ Implement the various resolutions of the League of Nations regarding the Sino-Japanese incident since 1931. ㊃ Various countries jointly implement sanctions against Japan in order to curb violence and ensure peace in the Far East, which is also to preserve human culture. Briefly stated, hoping for your consideration, and wishing the conference success and human civilization to flourish day by day, the Chinese Seamen's Resistance and Support Association respectfully winter,</p>

<h3>Thorough Clearing of Enemy Goods in Fujian Province by Deadline</h3>
<p>Xiamen Registration Valued at Two Million Yuan, Customs Revenue Sharply Decreased in August and September</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The markets of Xiamen and Southern Fujian were almost monopolized by enemy goods. Since the Provincial Anti-Enemy Association decided to thoroughly clear enemy goods from the entire province, registration began in September, with a deadline of one month, until October, to complete the auction. The registered enemy goods stockpiled in Xiamen city alone were valued at over two million yuan, with silk fabrics being the most abundant, followed by general merchandise, then marine products, pigments, hardware, porcelain, ginseng and medicines, imported firewood, matches, wine, etc., totaling thirteen categories, from 471 businesses. Since October, all streets in the city have been holding large-scale clearance sales of enemy goods at reduced prices, creating a lively atmosphere. However, the silk fabrics are mostly summer goods, which were not sold due to public boycotts in July and August and are unsuitable for winter sales. Many of the general merchandise items are also out of season. Furthermore, apart from marine products, most of the goods are not daily necessities. In these extraordinary times, the social economy is not affluent, so even with clamorous advertising, very few transactions are made. Each business sells only a hundred or so yuan worth of goods per day, with some selling only tens of yuan or a dozen yuan. The entire city's daily sales do not exceed twenty thousand yuan. At the end of the one-month period, only six or seven hundred thousand yuan can be sold, making a thorough clearing impossible. The businesses then requested permission to export the goods and sell them in Southeast Asia. This was approved by the Provincial Anti-Enemy Association, which stipulated the following measures: ㊀ Register the names and quantities of goods to be exported; ㊁ Specify where in Southeast Asia the goods will be sold; after arriving at the destination, appropriate proof must be obtained; ㊂ The goods must be shipped out within this month (October), limited to one shipment. Currently, businesses are busy with overseas shipping. However, the boycott of Japanese goods in Southeast Asia is also very enthusiastic, and it is not limited to overseas Chinese, so it may be difficult to sell the goods. Furthermore, the Provincial Anti-Enemy Association stipulated that after this clearing of enemy goods throughout the province, anyone found with them again will be considered a traitor, and those who report them will be rewarded with 60%. After the deadline, the Anti-Enemy Association will centrally auction off the remaining enemy goods. In Fujian province, the enemy goods, silk fabrics and general merchandise, apart from a small portion of cloth produced by Japanese factories in Shanghai and shipped here, most of the cloth and rayon and serge are manufactured in Japan. Xiamen and Southern Fujian obtain them from the Taiwanese piece goods merchants in this city, which is cheaper than directly purchasing from Osaka, Kobe, or Taiwan, because these enemy goods are brought from Taiwan by so-called "water traders" who specialize in carrying luggage as passengers. The same is true for general merchandise. Previously, these "water traders" openly engaged in smuggling, relying on Japanese influence. The Xiamen Customs and the Japanese Consul signed an agreement two years ago, limiting the amount each person could carry, inspecting the goods, and paying taxes according to the "small cargo" rate. In name, they paid taxes, but in reality, the taxes paid were only 40-50% of the statutory tax rate. Furthermore, many people completely smuggled goods along the coast by sailboat. In the past, Japanese goods accounted for 90% of the silk fabric market in Xiamen and Southern Fujian. Next was porcelain. In the past, the best quality porcelain was Jiangxi porcelain, followed by Dehua porcelain from this province. Dehua products were sold annually to Southeast Asia, Shantou, Guangdong, Fuzhou, and Xiamen, valued at five to six hundred thousand yuan. Japanese porcelain began to be imported in 1926. Initially, due to high prices, it had little impact. After 1930, Japanese porcelain was sold at reduced prices, gradually taking over the market for Chinese porcelain. After the "September 18th Incident," Japanese porcelain suffered a major blow, but it later revived. In the past two years, the porcelain market has been almost entirely monopolized by enemy goods, and Jiangxi porcelain has almost disappeared. Dehua porcelain only sells a little over one hundred thousand yuan annually. Next is seafood, where enemy goods account for two-thirds. As for ginseng and medicines, Korean ginseng and abalone are entirely enemy goods. However, no one cares about these luxury items now.</p>
<p>Xiamen Customs revenue can reach over 600,000 yuan in peak months and over 400,000 yuan in slow months, averaging 500,000 yuan per month. From January to July of this year, the average monthly revenue remained at 500,000 yuan. In August, it decreased to 324,787.01 yuan, and in September, it sharply decreased to 132,588.97 yuan. The Xiamen Customs area covers all of Southern Fujian and a large part of Western Fujian and has long been a well-known port with a large trade deficit. Since the opening of the port, almost 70 years ago, there has been a trade deficit. The highest was in 1930, with imports of over 19 million Haikwan taels and exports of over 4 million taels. It declined annually thereafter, but in the past two years, imports have remained at 30 million yuan and exports at 4 million yuan, with an annual trade deficit of over 26 million yuan. Therefore, although tax revenue decreased in August and September, the outflow of cash due to exports also decreased, amounting to only four or five million yuan in the two months.</p>

<h3>Fewer Casualties from Stray Bullets</h3>
<p>Residents near the war zone in western Shanghai have been moving to safer areas, resulting in fewer casualties from stray bullets. Yesterday, the Special First Court Prosecutor's Office had no corpses for examination, the first time since the Shanghai War. Although a ten-year-old boy, Zhang Jingfu, was killed by a stray bullet in Fahuazhen today, the date he was hit was the 29th of last month. Therefore, the number of deaths from stray bullets in the recent period has decreased by over 60% compared to the past.</p>
<h3>European Mail Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Today, the President Doumer arrived in Shanghai, carrying 110 bags of mail from Marseille. At the same time, the Comte de Flandre also arrived in Shanghai at 2:00 PM today, carrying European mail. The Shanghai Postal Administration sent mail boats to transport the mail to the distribution bureau for delivery to the recipients.</p>
<h3>Modern Chinese Youth</h3>
<p>— Cen Qiaorun</p>
<p>Our country is now at the final critical juncture of life and death. How should the people of the whole country save this precarious motherland? We must understand that the so-called justice and humanity of maintaining peace have long been shattered by the fierce artillery fire of imperialism, and the creed of the League of Nations has long been torn apart by selfish desires. Do we still want to rely on the League of Nations? Do we still hope that it will uphold justice and sanction violence? To put it bluntly, there is simply no second way other than the entire nation uniting to rise up and save itself.</p>
<p>But we know that youth are the pillars of the country and the backbone of society. The life of a nation and the future of a country are entirely entrusted to them. Therefore, to save the danger of modern China and to revive our nation, we must rely on the modern Chinese youth to work hard.</p>
<p>Ordinary cold-blooded youth, ordinary pleasure-seeking youth, are not worthy of being modern youth. These people will inevitably be eliminated sooner or later, but how can one be worthy of being a modern youth? It can be broadly divided into the following points: ㊀ Have the determination to save the country. We should clearly understand that the country is our only lifeline. Without the country, there will be no people. Saving the country is saving our own lives, which is also saving the lives of the masses. Therefore, we must have the determination to save the country with the attitude of "the country exists and we exist, the country perishes and we perish." ㊁ Have military skills and knowledge. Modern warfare is not just a plane war relying on guns and cannons, but a three-dimensional war and a chemical war. Therefore, we must first cultivate rich scientific knowledge, and everyone should have the ability to shoot and kill enemies and have knowledge of poison gas prevention and air defense. ㊂ Have a strong physique. We have always been known as "the sick men of East Asia." To eliminate this dishonorable ridicule, we should intensify our physical training and create a steel-like resistance force to serve as the vanguard of the nation.</p>
<p>Other conditions such as obeying leaders and having a spirit of unity are also necessary for modern youth.</p>
<p>Youth across the country, rise up quickly! I hope that all the youth in the country will become modern youth, then the bright future of China and the revival of the Chinese nation can be realized in no time.</p>
