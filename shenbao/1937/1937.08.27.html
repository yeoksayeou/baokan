<h3>羅店頑敵全部解决敵主力進犯計劃失敗</h3>
<p>斃敵無算輜重彈藥掃數截獲　乍浦海防鞏固並無敵軍登陸</p>
<p>今晨一時、本報所獲前方消息、我軍在羅店鎮東北追擊殘敵、勢如破竹、至昨晚七時許、已告解决、敵軍主力進犯計劃、至此完全失敗、計斃敵無算敵所遺輜重彈藥、為我掃數截獲、我軍積極向前推進、一方搜索殘敵、同時輿獅子林方面駐軍會合增原沿岸實力、羅店西北約十里之地、尚有殘敵約千餘人、到處亂竄、歸路截斷、已陷於進退維谷之境、刻我軍跟踪痛剿、最短期內、卽可肅淸、又敵人二十五日晨、進擾羅店時、瀏河口方面、亦同時發現敵蹤、我沿口守備部隊、當卽沉着應付、敵終不得逞惟口外敵艦、尚有十餘艘、隨時準備乘隙登陸、我軍已加緊戒備、兵力雄厚、决無問題、</p>
<h3>羅店鎮頑敵敗退</h3>
<p>昨晚七時已全部擊　退我軍進抵獅子林飽台</p>
<p>昨夜十一時、據前方報告、羅店鎮東北之殘餘敵兵、被我軍猛烈追擊、敵倉皇敗退、於昨晚七時已全部解决、我軍已進抵獅子林砲台、嚴密戒備、該鎮西北方面、仍有敵軍小部千餘人、現與我軍激戰中、</p>
<p>中央社、據某軍事機關息、羅店附近之敵軍、已被我軍重重包圍繳械中、二次向羅店進襲之敵軍、亦已被我軍堵絕、包圍激戰、最短期中、卽可解决、</p>
<p>中央社、羅店敵軍、經我軍猛烈攻擊、已向後退却、我軍已收復羅店鎭、並進擊殘敵至羅店以北之木杓鎮沈家橋一帶、聞此次由小川沙口登陸向我羅店進攻之敵、共計三聯隊、羅店鎮一役、敵死傷約三千人、我軍亦傷亡甚重、昨（二十六）日下午、我軍增援部隊續到、積極部署、於昨夜開始總攻據我軍事家觀察、敵人對於此綫、旣以全力進攻、自當負嵎頑抗惟我軍實力雄厚、士氣極旺、殘敵决可殱滅、</p>
<p>昨據山新塘市逃滬之難民述稱、連日敵機、不分晝夜、在羅店周圍三十餘里內到處擲彈轟炸、</p>
<p>盛家橋敵被擊退却</p>
<p>確息、昨（二十六日）晚九時許、據前方捷報、退集羅店東北之盛家橋一帶敵人、尚圖頭强抵抗、經救軍奮勇追擊、於昨日旁晚五時左右、被我軍擊潰、敵傷亡極重、現殘部向獅子林方面退却、我軍正沿江猛烈追逐中、</p>
<p>上岸敵軍約五千人</p>
<p>據軍息、敵方援軍三萬人、於二十二日開抵淞口、業由吳淞張華浜·蕰藻浜·等處偷渡登陸者約計五千人、其中一千五自人已戰死及溺憋、所餘三千五百人、則尚在負嵎頑抗、至於集結淞口之部隊、尚圖繼續登陸、迄未得逞、並悉敵軍之偷渡登陸、均在清晨當天未黎明時云</p>
<p>登陸陰謀决難成就</p>
<p>某軍事機關發言人稱、此次敵人欲師‘二八’故智、以重兵在吳淞一帶江口登岸、企圖推我側背對於此點、我軍早有防備、連日以來、敵難挾其砲火飛機之威力、掩護主力部隊登陸、但登陸之後、迭受嚴重打擊、死傷無算、我軍並在敵高級軍官屍首之圍囊內、搜獲共作戰部隊配備地圖、敵之一切企圖、已完全暴露、故登陸之敵、决不得逞、</p>
<p>瀏河口敵終不得逞</p>
<p>軍息、敵人於前　𠥻五晨優羅店時、劉河口方面同時發現敵踪、我沿口守備部隊當卽沉着應付、敵終不得逞、口外敵艦十餘艘之敵軍、尙圖柴隙登岸、我軍已加緊戒備、兵力極為雄厚、足予擊退、</p>
<p>張華浜站殘敵潰竄</p>
<p>吳淞張華浜車站之敵軍約四五百人、因被我軍包圍、無法竄回敵艦、現尙困守其地、異常恐慌、惟恃其海軍砲火之掩護、希圖掙扎、昨二十六晚八時許、敝艦復以猛烈砲火、向我軍陣綫轟擊、一部分殘敵向蕰藻浜方面逃竄、期分我軍兵力、我已派隊兜閱、現尚在激戰中、吳淞昨日尙稱安謐、自蕰藻浜至砲台灣一帶敵軍肅消後、並無繼續登陸、我軍仍嚴陳以待、如敵再來犯、决予以迎頭掃擊、昨日、張華浜方面尚有殘敵三百餘人、因歸路已斷、四處逃散、我軍正在搜擊、記者觀察昨日之景象、似將戰事重心由吳淞北移至川沙瀏河等地帶、故該處登岸敵軍頗多、惟倉卒間上陸毫無防禦工事、昨被我軍取包圍形勢、仍在激戰中、</p>
<p>南匯海邊又現敵艦</p>
<p>昨日（廿六）在南匯海邊又發現敵艦二三艘、竟日往來游弋、企圖再度登陸、但因我軍嚴防．終未得逞、又在南匯大洋洲附近、據漁民報告、昨晨有類似魚船數十艘、忽來忽去、是否敵船、甚可資疑、</p>
<p>川沙敵軍受創而退</p>
<p>川沙方面、於前晨有一小部敵軍乘各路激戰時、在該處沙灘附近、企圖登岸、當被我軍立卽擊退、未幾敵援軍趕到、又復進窺、其總數不下五六百名、在敵機及重砲掩護之下、猛向我軍陣地衝鋒、我軍早有准備、亦立郎反守為攻、雙方肉搏良久、敵終受創而退、嗣後又曾數度進犯、均未得逞、昨晨黎明時、敵軍尚圖偷襲、因曾發生激戰、刻下仍在殱滅中、又訊川沙方面、前晚曾有一部份敵軍登岸、我方兵力甚足、佈防周密、現該處要陸之敵軍、被找三面包圍、夜間曾有激烈戰事、至昨日午該、已全部擊退、</p>
<p>中央社、敵電約有二三百人、前日上午由川沙登陸、我軍當卽奮勇迎擊、激戰至烈、據今晨所得消息、我軍於前晚已將川沙方面繫玲之敵包圍、正在殱滅之中、</p>
<p>乍浦並無敵軍登陸</p>
<p>（本報特訊）外傳乍浦方面、已有敵人登陸、發生激戰之說、本報以事關重要、特電乍浦通訊員、調查眞相旋接復電、稱乍浦現極平靜、並無敵人登陸、並云乍浦為浙省第一門戶、防務極為鞏固、敵入無論如何頑强、决難得逞、昨晚本報記者復詢市由前方歸來之某軍事長官、亦經否認其事、據彼所知、日來敵艦數艘、駛往乍浦口外約五十海哩之處、遙為窺察、不足為虜、</p>
<p>虹口方面有小接觸</p>
<p>昨（二十六）夜八時、前方確息、我軍在虹口方面陣诽、佈置極為鞏固、前昨二日、敵在吳淞等慶、偷渡登岸、故在該處亦頻以十隊向我佯取攻勢、一則所以牽制我方兵力、一則欲試探我軍防務、我軍當卽予還擊、敵倉皇逃回其所踞工事、我軍現亦加强兵力、嚴密警戒、目前戰况、僅時時發生小接觸、戰綫並無任何變動、</p>
<p>我機夜襲轟炸敵陣</p>
<p>我空軍於昨晨二時許、夜襲敵艦、當我轟炸機在驅逐機保護之下、飛抵滬市上空之時、浦江中之敵艦、陣地投擲炸彈多枚、旋卽飛往淞口轟炸敵艦、敵方損失奇重、我機於任務完果後、卽行安然而返、</p>
<p>（中央社）前（𠥻五日）下午五時許、我軍在𣓾行東北、川高射機關槍擊落敵機一架、</p>
<p>敵軍死亡確實統計</p>
<p>自‘八一三’戰事發生以來、迄今已兩星期、據確實統計、敵軍死者為三千五百八十名、傷者達五千名以上、我軍傷亡官兵尚不及敵之半數、聞敵為鎮壓軍心及預防國內民衆反對起見、對於死傷官兵實數、始終祕不發表、所有敵軍屍體、大部已在上海設法毀滅、</p>
<p>嘉定城內被炸大火</p>
<p>據嘉定方面甫來上海之難民云嘉定域廂區敵機時來轟炸、在城內之縣商會、一帶、因被敵投擲燃燒彈燃燒甚烈、城外亦有數處火警惟城內秩序尚佳、居民大多已避難他處、故並無傷亡羅店方面於前日（二十五日）下午又起大火、全鎮幾盡成焦土、</p>
<p>日否認搜查蘇領署</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、昨夜外間盛傳日兵曾强入駐滬蘇聯領事署搜查云云、今日曾由日大使署予以否認、惟悉日當局確曾申請蘇聯副領事調查談廈之信號燈光、該副領事已予拒絕謂須先獲蘇聯大使之許可、</p>
<p>永安紗廠抵押美商</p>
<p>大陸報云、日大使署發言人、日前謂吳淞永安紗廠、曾妄懸美旗、並容華兵伏於廠內、封擊日兵云云、昨晚已由該廠總經理郭君、予以切實否認、謂目前廠中、僅留守門者二人、至其所以縣美旗者、因該廠已於六月二十七日抵押輿美商愼昌洋行、聞駐滬美總領事署、曾照中日軍事當局、說明該廠現為美人產業、請阻軍隊向之轟擊、再全廠已向美國公司保有兵險、</p>

<h3>違反國際海洋法敵封鎖我海口</h3>
<p>其實於我並無影響　各國將提嚴重抗議</p>
<p>上海日本海軍第三艦隊司令長谷川、宣布封鎖我東南海口事、記者往詢我國抗界、據云、僅見本埠某外國報有此記載、照日海軍第三艦隊司令宣佈之封鎖區城、依其經緯度所列、乃從揚子江之江陰起、几上海之吳淞·浙江之沿海岸·甯波之鎭海·舟山羣島·溫州口岸·福建泉州·以至汕頭潮州爲止、包括蘇·浙·閩·粵·四省之海岸、而將南華到揚子江一綫、亦在封鎖範圍、自宣布封鎖之日起、在此封鎖區域內、如遇中國輪船、卽實行鉋擊、且隨時隨地、彼可滋擾、找國航界、在未開戰前、早窺到此點、所有南華各輪、早已自行停駛、揚子江更將江陰口封鎖、故其此次之封鎖政策、於我則亳無影響、於彼亦絕無若何之利益也、</p>
<p>記者又往訪某外商輪公司負責人、據稱、彼亦僅見外報有此記載、尚未得到日方之正式通知、但中日兩、旣未正式宣戰、照國際例、日人不應貿然封鎖中國海口、今所封鎖之區域、雖限於南華至揚子江口一段、但此一綫內、各國輪船、行駛甚多日人此擧、顯違反國際慣例、妨碍各國利益各國均將對日方提出嚴這之抗議、</p>
<p>關於上海方面、日海軍之於吳淞口的行動、從本月二十日以後、對中國船、固已禁阻其往李、甚且將工部局輿甯波同鄉會合辦之運送離民輪、亦嚴加拒絕其進出、一再交涉、均不能允可、而且每日下午五時起、至翌晨八時止、任何外國輪、亦不許共通過吳淞口、而由日海軍實行封鎖之、致使各國輪船之載送離滬僑民者、亦發生種種阻碍、各國深感不滿、亦向日方嚴重交涉、</p>
<p>郭泰祺之談片</p>
<p>中央社倫敦二十六日路透電、中國駐項大使郭泰祺、今日向路透社記者發表談話稱、日本之封鎖中國海口、更足證實日本於對華舉行大規模侵略戰爭之中、企圖依照其計劃、完全征服中國、但各國應明瞭、日本對於中國之目的、不過完成其計劃之途徑、因日本欲在取得中國之人工及資源之後、建立太平洋區域之霸權、現世界各國、或表示其無力保持其利益、或無保持其利益之積極願望、而中國獨悉索敝賦、以與强電周旋是中國之抗戰、不僅爲自己圖存而戰、蓋亦爲世界各國直接受日本之無法及野心之影響者伸正義也、郭氏復稱、有關係各國、竟無法阻止日本之利用公共租界爲軍事根據地、無以維持絕對之中立、且無以維持對於中國之條約義務、故目前遠東可悲局面之造成者、實由於國際公法及治安以及條約尊嚴者、自六年前日本纂取滿洲後卽已全部解體之故也、</p>
<p>美法嚴重反響</p>
<p>中央社華盛頓二十六日路透電、美國對於日海軍之封鎖中國海口、已採取嚴重之觀念、並恐日本難於中國商航與外國商航之間劃分界綫、紐約泰晤士報則謂、倘日本截留外國船隻、則羅斯福總統將難以避免宣告戰事狀態之存在云中央社巴黎二十六日哈瓦斯電、日本第二艦隊司令長谷川中將、日昨在上海發表宣言禁止中國船舶在中國長江以南沿海一帶航行、據此間傅聞、日本當局並曾宣稱、對於行駛中國海岸之外國船舶、當保留權利、得隨時令其停駛、俾查騐其所屬國藉云、此間官方人士、頃以爲此說似未必可靠　蓋日本倘採取此種態度、則必不免引起嚴重之國際反響、日本縱使有權搜查中國船舶、但斷不能搜查外國船舶、且按之國際海徉法倘欲實施封鎖、必須在正式宣戰之後、日必須通知各中立國而後可、今中日兩國間、並未正式宣戰、且日本政府亦並未照會各國、通知實施封鎖也、</p>
<p>中央社巴黎二十六日哈瓦斯電、右派斐伽難報頃評論遠東時局云、“日本現正依照預定計劃在中國境內展開戰事、此項計劃表面上似無系統、實則凖備已非一日、其在上海作戰目的、乃欲破壞中國政府之威望、亦阻止中國自海道獲得軍火糧食接濟、總之、日本對於控制上海海口一層、抱有决心、英國政府所提出上海中立化一項建議所由失敗者、其故亦卽在此、目前軍火糧食、事實上已無法自上海輸入中國、今後問越之癥結、乃在於廣州之是否將取上海地位而代之、果爾、則日本軍艦必得珠江江面、一併予以封鎖、當屬亳無疑義、日本曾在澎湖羣島設立海空軍根據地、其地與廣州相去并不甚遠封鎖珠江、自非難事、特香港之與珠江、猶如唇齒之相依、而香港則爲不列顚帝國在遠東方面之堡壘與實庫、珠江茍被封鎖、香港亦必陷於厄境、此其結果、恐將發生重大事端”云、</p>
<p>港商深感不安</p>
<p>中央社香港二十六日路透電、日本對於中國船隻之海上封鎖、此問商界羣認爲中日戰爭開始以來、最引起不安之事態、而香港之商業、勢將蒙受極大之損失、英文大美晚報云、據日第三艦隊法律顧問國際公法敎授Shinobo博士聲稱日艦隊實行封鎖中國海面後、對於外艦、雖不能估有、或扣留、或迫令更改航行方向、但日海軍當局如對船隻之國籍懷疑時、可登船查明、中國船隻在禁區內行駛者、無論其是否載有軍火或軍用品、悉將加以扣留、因此舉非戰時封鎖、故不能阻止外船載運軍火至華、惟吾人如發覺外船載有戰時違禁品、則可取有效方法、行使先購權云、又據日當局今晨向新聞訪員宣稱、華船爲日軍拘獲者、將予扣留、而不沒收或鑿沉之、至所載貨物、將否視爲違禁品、尙本决定、縣掛外旗之船隻、將不加以阻止、且尙未取宣布若干違禁品之步驟云、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>日本封鎖我國海口一事。不問此事對於我國有若何之影響。對於敵人有若何之利益。但按之國際海洋法。倘欲實施封鎖。㊀必須正式宣戰後。㊁必先通知各中立國。今中日間雖有日人所謂“偶發事件。”但未正式開戰。聞亦未通知中立各國。吁。國際間全部條約法規。被日入踐踏盡矣。</p>
<p>英大使許閣森博士。於昨日由京來泥中途被敵機狙擊。身受重傷。殊爲驚訝。蓋此事是否足以引起英人之不安。與英國應該對於日入採取若何之態度。我不願加以論列。而日入慘無人道之行爲。已十足表現於世界。則紅十字會救護人員之被殺。尚有何說。</p>

<h3>記宋哲元退出後的北平</h3>
<p>— 曹實</p>
<p>公寓裹每天早晨有二個麻子送報，大麻子送小型報，小麻子送大報，從二十九軍退出後北平就如同死城一樣，除了反宣傳的消息外，漢奸的理論漸漸抬頭了！送報的同報館的來往多，報紙上不敢登的消息他們倒有點。七點多鑛門口就濟滿了等報紙的人，多半是學生或機關的職員，相望唏噓黯然無語，所以近些日子來市民多一口同音的說：學界最興奮也最垂頭喪氣。昨天（八月六日）的日報載夜八時馮玉祥將軍播音，這條新聞很快的剩入每個人的心窩，吃過晚飯後往街上蹓躂，熟人見面頭一句便是：看今天老馮怎麼說，兩大都市這麼些人口，眞就讓人家一嚇便白拿走麼？有播音機的商號門口事變後第一次這麼𤍠鬧，警察也臨時增多了！“老的”“少的”“男的”“女的”“舖夥三老闆”長袍短褂，三一羣倆一夥的在交相談商。好些商店門口人行路都不通了！</p>
<p>八點過了二十分播音機裹仍是汩汩的有怪電波擾亂，人羣中發生擾動了！踩足擦脚的聲音先後的接續着，失望的表人情掛在每個的面孔上，沉重的脚步聲中人漸漸四散，又恢復了舖子以前的清靜·警察也無精打采的走開。“他媽的又是鬼子在做怪！唉！不知道政府現在有辦法無有？”這幾句隱約的悲倦談話常常會在散了的人羣中聽見。</p>
<p>一羣人把大麻子圍住了，大麻子昨天在鼓樓聽見南京播音，馮玉祥說：今年華北豐收，動員令要在秋後下，總剩一兵一卒也要抗戰到底。“好！他媽的老馮眞是漢子，敢說硬話！”這是公寓的茶房拍大腿後的讚語，大麻子的小報一分而凈·小麻子推脚踏車進來了，“怎麽樣？小麻子有消息麽？”又是一邊抢報一邊圍着問“館裹頭人說：承德有軍事，每天都有日本兵北開。”隨着便是一陣喜欣的笑聲。“不能看！他媽的漢奸報竟造謠！”一堆新碎報紙紛落在地下了！</p>
<p>苦悶籠罩了整個的北平，眞是奇蹟！平津的交通綫被日本拉制住了還談最後關頭，為的“勉除生民塗炭”才撤兵離平。各麼好的口號都掩護不住鐵一般的史實演證，百五十萬人民讓宋哲元一走全成“甕中之鳖”！向虎狼求和平是增加敵人的勇氣，要感謝日本人在外交上的顧慮，北平城內是勉了塗炭，可是四郊的百姓可苦了，通州保安隊反正後緊接着便是一個塗殺民族間的仇恨將何時了結！廿九軍退却的槍聲驚動了保安隊的愛國心，通州在轉瞬之間收復了，豈知這份偉大力量讓後無緩兵所犧牲了！日本的增援到了！保安隊不能孤軍守城，北平為日本所估前後夾擊，蒙重大之損失。忍辱念羞幾年的毒心事敵的苦心結果是白費了！這力量是多麼偉大而機會又多麼難得？嚴密的組織詳盡的計晝，在這緊要關頭是一點也不能放鬆的，民族的存亡都危在一髪，而自己的隊伍中還能發生猜忌麼？國危矣！吾儕當奮起，政府諸公當速改前非而地方當局亦應“痛定思痛”！北平就在“自己猜忌”“組織不嚴密”“計劃不詳盡”幾個缺點下而犧牲！</p>
<p>中華民族一定會復興·盧溝橋事變以後北平民氣和國家意識的强烈就是缺的表記士卒的用命民衆的緊張都是中華民族復國大業中的主要因基·但這要舉國一致共同奮起！勿猜忌！勿自亂！我們雖在危城之中，我們並不急燥，北平的民衆時時刻刻準備響應明日中國之自衛戰呢！</p>
<h3>察北抗日救國軍突起收復啕廟村</h3>
<p>正分向崇禮多倫前進　抗日軍五路聲勢漸大　匪偽經濟已極形不安</p>
<p>張垣通信、連日以來日軍迭以少數飛機、進窺張垣、並積極佈置𤍠河察北偽軍、抽調開往其所謂適中地區、日本正規師隊、亦分頭向我南口進攻、更準備進攻我察緩、當此寇敵深入國難嚴重期中、忽有一部𤍠血民軍乘機收復啕𡃤廟石嘴子等村、崇禮縣城、亦已有指社克復之勢、茲將各路戰况及恢復啕𡃤廟經過、众民軍內部概况、分述於次、</p>
<p>淪陷經年之察北崇禮縣啕𡃤廟村、突於本月十一日早二時、為義民喬建中·楊振聲·張金聲·曹發通·及民衆抗戰游擊大隊卜子謙等、共同克復、當時曾與駐該村之爲蒙古保安隊發生激戰的一小時、當塲將僞監督公署之指導官日人今野卯一郞擊斃、俘獲偽蒙古保安隊一名、馬十餘匹、少槍八十餘枝、因啕𡃤廟偽警察署長馬子龍，巡官熬玉璞、會預先向民軍接洽反正、誓死報國、故地方秩序、暫山馬等維持、十二日、啕𡃤廟附近之石嘴子·驛馬圖·諸村、又次第收復、並遍懸靑天白日旗幟、刻已由我察軍正式派隊駐守、義民喬建中等、復向崇禮縣城西灣子推進指顧問亦有攻克之勢、而民軍及義民大部、今已行抵距張北縣北九十里之麻泥壩、正在相機前進之中、</p>
<p>察北民軍、過去因均擔任密秘工作、番號組織、皆不甚詳、現在所知者、計有民衆抗戰軍游擊隊、共有張仲英等四隊、現在又有義民即收復啕𡃤廟村之主力部隊、其隊號爲民衆抗日救國軍、喬建中爲總司令分轄五路、第一路司令曹發通、第二路司令張金聲、第三路司令楊振聲、第四路司令韓希賢、弟五路司令婁冠軍、至其部下實力若干、因散駐各地、現尙未知、惟駐赤城縣屬之黑河鎭、有五百餘人、刻出韓希賢率領韓原擬與喬建中同取祟禮、現因喬部兵力足可收復該城而有餘故已改道直趨多倫、目的在截斷偽軍歸疏、予以極大打擊其第五路司令婁冠軍部、因婁司令久歷軍伍頻經戰陣、對於戰事、極有心得與經騐、現該隊幹部共有百餘人潛伏康保縣之某地、擬得隙親復康保、至其他各路、亦正在分頭秘密工作中、請勢益趨活躍、日僞軍在戰略運用上、極受打擊、</p>
<p>民衆抗日救國軍於收復啕𡃤之後、全村懸旗誌慶、並由曹發通以第一路司令名義、佈者安民、其原文云、“查我察北各縣、被强暴日本侵估、已達年餘、民衆處此水深火𤍠之中、僅爲刀上之俎、而其野心、仍圖得寸進尺、節節進迫、進來復以武力擾我平津、殺戮鄕民、種種毒辣手段、已為世所共認、我中華民族向主和平、處此忍無可忍之地步、是以各地民衆、紛組救國軍、而拯我民族於萬刦、現在本司令率健兒數百名、業於本月十日先將祟禮啕𡃤廟區所駐之匪軍驅走、並將民衆恨極之指導官今野卯、郞槍殺洩憤、其餘各縣、我各路軍正在進擊、不難指日克復、惟偽滿所發行之滿洲國紙幣銅元、自即日起、一律禁絕通用、本軍原係民衆武力、所到各地、情屬父老家鄕、决無秋毫之狀、仰各商民等、照常開市營業、勿自驚擾倘有不法之徒、造謠生事者、定予嚴懲不貸、切切此佈”、</p>
<p>又我方某部、已由大廟子·土木爾台地方、向商都節節進逼、商都縣屬西北屯墾隊地方、已有被我克復說、我方其他部隊、亦止在積極準備應戰中、至於察北偽軍方面消息、聞化德各偽機關人員、目前均極恐慌、正準備移設於康保縣城、以多倫爲其後方及𤍠察連系交通運輸之總彙點、同時並有德王於目前已離化德至今去向不明之傳言、李逆守信、則確於本月十日到達大靑溝、（即尙義）擬在該處或公會久駐、以期便於指揮偽軍、其駐沽源僞六師寳、音烏勒吉部士兵、常有携械潛逃情事、軍心極度渙散、而人民方面、因久處日偽蹂躪下、憤慨尤深、今聞悉啕　廟村之收復、不禁興奮、亟盼車軍之降臨、拯置於袵席之上、張北方面、該縣屬之玻璃彩黃花坪一帶、現有日軍遍設砲位、以備固守、敵氣已餒、已可槪見張北城內之日偽軍每至夜間、均空城而出、散駐於城郊附近、天明後、再行入城、又高家營子以北、十四日上午十二時開到偽蒙古保安隊一百餘騎、</p>
<p>察北六縣、自被日軍包庇匪偽强行割據後、其匪僞軍政費之來源、一部係日本關東軍之供給、一部係實行苛雜括歛於民衆、且自去年紅格爾圖一役、其軍政重心之百林廟、（原名百漢廟）又相繼為我克復、予日偽軍政及經濟上以極大打擊、人民方面、納稅應役之繁劇、早已精力俱疲、致市面百業統呈簫條氣象、且市面流通之紙幣、多半均係値等冥鏹之偽“滿洲”中央銀行紙幣、我內地之中央·中國·交通·及察省銀行之法幣、因商賈貿遷而流入察北者、為數甚多一般民衆、因信念祖國對上述我方各銀行法幣、均視同璧簡、輕易不忍使用、現在大局滉沌、一般民衆、對於偽鈔、益不信任、致察北各縣、目前經濟狀況、極度恐慌、日偽方面、爲維持經濟計、已嗾張北紳耆、起而共謀補救方法、</p>
<h3>敬告各地靑年和民衆</h3>
<p>昨天有個朋友告訴我、“各地有無數靑年、無數民衆、要把他的能力貢獻給國家、苦於無路”、這確是一個很重要的問題、</p>
<p>我細細想來、他們要想做的、大約有兩件事、一件是從軍、去和敵人拚命、使他來一個少一個、一件是向政府投効、希望采用我的意見或者稍微有些補助、固然是𤍠心但恐怕沒有什麼用現世的戰爭、不是拚命的事、高的要有軍事的學識、低的也耍有正規的訓練、若是將普通的人民參雜其間、非徒無益而且有實、至於政治的實情我們完全隔膜、就是你有很高的政治的學識上一篇萬言書、也未必中肯、徒然使政府的人忙個不了、和我們談話、看我們的條陳耗費了有用的光陰、這也是有害而無益的、照這樣說我們國民的一腔𤍠血、向何處去灑呢、目莫着急、聽我道來、這回的戰爭、恐怕是東方的大戰、敵人的近衛首相、已經宣言準備作長期的戰爭、我們自然應當作長期的應戰、應戰、不專靠前方、也不專靠中央、也不專靠各省的政府、還是要靠各內地的人民、我盼望各地的靑年、各地的民衆、干萬不要離開家鄕、就是不在家鄕的、以後都會商埠、很不容易謀生、莫若趁早回去、大家聯合起來、在本地做些自己能夠做的事。</p>
<p>第一是維持秩序、這本是官廳的責任、但是有地方上的人出來帮忙格外有效、在這大難之時、沒有什麼階級、沒有什麼派別、就是平日間有一些意見的、也應該一筆勾消、大家只有一條心、就是救亡圖存、其間有幾件很主要的、（甲）安定人心、這幾天我聽見內地的人說、敵人飛機經過的地方、偶然丟下幾個炸彈、人心十分恐慌、住在城裹的紛紛往鄕下搬、其實死傷的人、其數甚少逃也未必不死、不逃也未必不生、先動大家不要慌張地方上不鬧出亂子、諸專便可着手、(乙)消除匪棍、這是要用軍警的力量、拘集在一定的塲所强迫做工、（丙）加緊訓練原有的公民訓練應該繼續推廣、近在戰事的地方、可以帮助做後方的工作、離開遠些的、也可以預備政府的微調(丁)督促敎育、未來的國民種子、全在兒童、無論怎麼艱難、敎育不能停頓、凡是受過敎育的靑年、不能冉進學校的都應該把敎育後輩的事務、担當起來、但是在這非常時期之內我主張應該廢去星期的休息、寒暑的放假、</p>
<p>第二是大生產、無數的同胞在前綫禦敵、全國生產的力量减縮不少、衣食兩字、恐怕發生困難、這幾年來、食糧布匹、一部分要靠外國進口、以後恐怕沒有錢來購買了、我們在後方的不單要供給自己、還要供給前綫的同胞別無他法、只有加倍工作、自耕自織、男子漢向來不下田的、也要帮同耕種、大人家的婦女們、不要儘在家裹閒坐趕快起來績麻織布、轉眼天氣寒冷、在前綫的冬衣也要趁早替他們預備、至於家常日用的物品、我們久已用慣外國貨了、以後要痛改前非、能夠用手工做的儘量用我們的手工、精糙些、不適用些、也只好將就將就、還要大大的儲蓄起來、供應前方、晋朝的陶侃、平時收拾了許多竹頭木屑、後來打仗都有很大的用處、這幾天抗敵後援會徵求的物品、像蔴袋蔴繩竹木扁担等類、都是內地可以多多供給的、此外還有不少的東西、有些可以仿造或替代的我們能夠替他們預備下來、於應戰士也有不少的帮助、</p>
<p>照此看來、我們現在要做的事做不完、只要肯貢獻自己的能力怎麼說無路呢、以前種種譬如昨日死、以後種種譬如今日生、抖擻着精神、朝著苦幹、不必向對方發些空洞的咒罵、也不要在岐路作那無謂的奔跑、</p>
<h3>新永安輪昨日再開蘇州</h3>
<p>內河申蘇綫、昨日上午、仍有新永安輪一艘、自北蘇州河天后宮橋啟椗開駛、拖帶馭船一艘、載客約三百餘人、申錫昨日無船開駛、又因京滬路業已加班開駛客車、故內河搭客、已較前數日為减少、又申湖綫前經湖社委員會設法船隻、遷送同鄕難民回籍、茲因大部業經遷送、故以後遷送事宜、改由市救濟會合併辦理、</p>
<h3>劉曼卿等失踪</h3>
<p>恐已在大世界慘劇中遇難</p>
<p>蒙藏委員會劉憂鄉女士、為我國唯一熟悉康藏情形之專家、目前上海抗敵戰事開展後、劉女士為組織靑康藏抗敵後援委員會、特偕西康民衆代表曹銳之由京來京、下榻南京飯店四三○號、向各方奔走接洽抗敵後援、詎自本月十四日後、劉曹兩氏同時宣告失踪、其親友等經！餘日來之尋覓、迄今仍無下落、按劉女士失踪之時、適為大世界炸彈慘劇生之日、故一般親友、深信劉民已羅難、但屍身則仍無法發現、現劉女士在南京飯店中尚留有皮箱行李多件、南京方面、亦曾設法向各方探詢、迄今亦無結果、按劉女士為我國唯一傑出之康藏問題研究者、並能操極流俐之康藏言語曾兩次代表政府、入康藏宣揚中央意旨、著有“康藏軹征”·“邊疆敎育”·二書、如此次不幸爲國難而犧牲、殊屬可惜、</p>
<h3>電話公司將恢復匯山區電話服務</h3>
<p>上海電話公司匯山路分公司、前因戰爭緊張、電源中斷、不得已將公司暫行封鎻、所有服務人員、亦暫行撤退、昨日起、（二十六日）該分公司原有人員、已照常辦公、擬將該處電話、即日恢復惟該區發生火災甚烈、該分公司適當其衝、幸得救火會營救得力、故損失極微、據該公司工程師估計、因地下及天空綫路工程毁損甚多、須一星期方能修理竣工、恢復通話、</p>
<h3>工部局總监函謝監獄職員</h3>
<p>自戰事發生後、工部局監獄、適處戰區、危險萬狀、獄中職員仍竭力維持、克奏厥職、公共租界工部局總董、特函警務處代理處長飽恩少校、表示感佩、略謂、“際茲戰局緊張之秋、本局監獄全體職員、克盡厥職成績斐然應請台端代鄙人向代理獄務監督、及全體職員、致其感佩之意各職員之遭遇、鄙人極表同情、現决竟盡棉力、將該員等目前之處境、加以改善”下略</p>

<h3>Complete Resolution of Stubborn Enemy in Luodian, Enemy's Main Force Invasion Plan Fails</h3>
<p>Countless Enemies Killed, All Supplies and Ammunition Seized. Zha Pu's Coastal Defense is Consolidated, No Enemy Troops Landed.</p>
<p>At 1:00 AM this morning, according to front-line news received by this newspaper, our army pursued the remaining enemy forces northeast of Luodian Town with irresistible force, and the situation was resolved by approximately 7:00 PM last night. The enemy's main force invasion plan has completely failed at this point. Countless enemies were killed and all of the supplies and ammunition left behind by the enemy were seized by our forces. Our army is actively advancing, searching for remaining enemies on one hand, and on the other hand, joining forces with the garrison troops in the Shizilin area to increase our strength along the coast. About ten miles northwest of Luodian, there are still more than a thousand remaining enemy soldiers, scurrying about everywhere, their retreat cut off, and they are trapped in a dilemma. Our army is pursuing and severely suppressing them, and they can be cleared up in the shortest possible time. In addition, when the enemy advanced to Luodian on the morning of the 25th, enemy traces were also found at the same time in the direction of Liuhekou. Our garrison troops along the coast immediately responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. However, there are still more than ten enemy warships outside the port, preparing to take the opportunity to land at any time. Our army has stepped up its vigilance, with abundant forces, and there is absolutely no problem.</p>
<h3>Stubborn Enemy in Luodian Town Defeated and Retreating</h3>
<p>Completely defeated at 7:00 PM last night, our army advances to Shizilin Fortress</p>
<p>According to a front-line report at 11:00 PM last night, the remaining enemy soldiers northeast of Luodian Town were fiercely pursued by our army. The enemy was defeated in a panic and was completely resolved by 7:00 PM last night. Our army has advanced to the Shizilin Fortress and is on strict alert. In the northwest of the town, there are still a small number of enemy troops, about a thousand people, currently engaged in fierce fighting with our army.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: According to a certain military agency, the enemy troops near Luodian have been heavily surrounded by our army and are being disarmed. The enemy troops who launched a second attack on Luodian have also been blocked by our army, surrounded and engaged in fierce fighting, which can be resolved in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The enemy troops in Luodian have retreated after being fiercely attacked by our army. Our army has recovered Luodian Town and is attacking the remaining enemy troops in the area of Mujiao Town and Shenjia Bridge, north of Luodian. It is reported that the enemy who landed from Xiaochawukou and attacked Luodian consisted of three regiments in total. In the battle of Luodian Town, the enemy suffered approximately 3,000 casualties. Our army also suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday afternoon (the 26th), our reinforcements continued to arrive and were actively deployed, and a general offensive began last night. According to our military experts, the enemy is attacking this line with all their strength and will certainly resist stubbornly. However, our army has strong strength and high morale, and the remaining enemy troops can definitely be annihilated.</p>
<p>According to refugees who fled from Shanxintang City to Shanghai yesterday, enemy planes have been dropping bombs and bombing everywhere in the area within thirty miles around Luodian, day and night.</p>
<p>Enemy at Shengjia Bridge Defeated and Retreating</p>
<p>Confirmed news: At approximately 9:00 PM last night (the 26th), according to a front-line victory report, the enemy forces retreating and gathering in the Shengjia Bridge area northeast of Luodian were still attempting to put up a stubborn resistance. After a valiant pursuit by the rescue army, they were defeated by our army at around 5:00 PM yesterday evening. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties, and the remaining troops are retreating towards the Shizilin area. Our army is fiercely pursuing them along the river.</p>
<p>About 5,000 Enemy Troops Ashore</p>
<p>According to military information, 30,000 enemy reinforcements arrived at Songkou on the 22nd, and approximately 5,000 of them secretly crossed and landed at Wusong, Zhanghuabang, and Yunzaobang. Among them, 1,500 people have already died in battle or drowned, and the remaining 3,500 are still putting up stubborn resistance. As for the troops gathered at Songkou, they are still trying to continue landing, but have not succeeded. It is also learned that the enemy's secret crossings and landings all took place in the early morning before dawn.</p>
<p>Landing Conspiracy Definitely Cannot Succeed</p>
<p>A spokesperson for a certain military agency stated that this time, the enemy wanted to repeat the "January 28th" incident, landing heavy troops at the estuary in the Wusong area in an attempt to push our flanks. Our army was prepared for this. In recent days, the enemy has been unable to use the power of its artillery fire and aircraft to cover the landing of its main force. However, after landing, it has suffered severe blows and countless casualties. Our army has also seized maps of the combat unit deployment in the pockets of the enemy's senior officers' corpses. All of the enemy's attempts have been completely exposed, so the landing enemy will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>Enemy at Liuhekou Ultimately Fails</p>
<p>Military news: When the enemy attacked Luodian on the morning of the 25th, enemy traces were also found at the same time in the Liuhekou area. Our garrison troops along the coast immediately responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. More than ten enemy warships outside the port are still trying to take the opportunity to land. Our army has stepped up its vigilance, with very strong forces, sufficient to repel them.</p>
<p>Remaining Enemy at Zhanghuabang Station Flees in Disarray</p>
<p>Approximately four or five hundred enemy troops at Zhanghuabang Station in Wusong, because they were surrounded by our army and unable to flee back to the enemy warships, are currently trapped in their location, extremely panicked, relying only on the cover of their naval artillery fire in the hope of struggling. Yesterday, on the 26th, at around 8:00 PM, our warships resumed fierce artillery fire, bombarding our army's front lines. A portion of the remaining enemy troops fled towards the Yunzaobang area, hoping to divert our army's forces. I have dispatched a team to encircle them, and fierce fighting is still underway. Wusong was still peaceful yesterday. After the enemy troops in the area from Yunzaobang to Paotaiwan were cleared, there were no continued landings. Our army is still waiting in strict formation. If the enemy comes to attack again, we will definitely give them a head-on blow. Yesterday, there were still more than 300 remaining enemy troops in the Zhanghuabang area, who were scattered everywhere because their retreat had been cut off. Our army is searching for them. A reporter observed yesterday's situation and it seems that the center of the war has shifted from Wusong north to the Chuansha and Liuhe areas. Therefore, there are quite a few enemy troops landing there. However, they landed in a hurry and without any defensive works. Yesterday, our army adopted an encirclement formation, and fierce fighting is still underway.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Appear Again Off the Coast of Nanhui</p>
<p>Yesterday (the 26th), two or three enemy warships were discovered again off the coast of Nanhui, cruising back and forth all day, attempting to land again. However, because of our army's strict defense, they ultimately failed. Also, near Dayangzhou in Nanhui, according to fishermen's reports, dozens of vessels resembling fishing boats suddenly appeared and disappeared yesterday morning. Whether they are enemy ships is highly questionable.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops at Chuansha Suffer Losses and Retreat</p>
<p>In the Chuansha area, a small number of enemy troops attempted to land near the beach there the day before yesterday, taking advantage of the fierce fighting on all fronts. They were immediately repelled by our army. Before long, enemy reinforcements arrived and resumed their attempts to invade, numbering no less than five or six hundred men. Under the cover of enemy aircraft and heavy artillery fire, they fiercely charged our army's positions. Our army was prepared and immediately counterattacked, turning defense into offense. Both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat for a long time, and the enemy ultimately suffered losses and retreated. Subsequently, they attacked several times, but all failed. At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy troops were still attempting to launch a sneak attack. Because fierce fighting had occurred, they are currently being annihilated. Also, it is reported that a portion of the enemy troops landed in the Chuansha area the night before last. Our forces are very strong and the defenses are tightly arranged. The enemy troops who landed in the area are now surrounded on three sides, and there was fierce fighting at night. By noon yesterday, they had all been repelled.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: About two or three hundred enemy soldiers landed in Chuansha on the morning of the day before yesterday. Our army immediately fought bravely to meet them, and the fighting was extremely fierce. According to news received this morning, our army surrounded the enemy in the Chuansha area the night before last and is annihilating them.</p>
<p>No Enemy Troops Landed at Zha Pu</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) It has been rumored that enemy troops have landed in the Zha Pu area and that fierce fighting has occurred. Because this newspaper considers the matter to be important, it specifically telegraphed a correspondent in Zha Pu to investigate the truth. We subsequently received a reply stating that Zha Pu is currently extremely peaceful and no enemy troops have landed. It also stated that Zha Pu is the first gateway of Zhejiang Province and that its defense is extremely solid. No matter how stubborn the enemy is, they will definitely not succeed. Last night, a reporter from this newspaper also inquired with a certain military officer who had returned from the front lines, who also denied the matter. According to what he knows, several enemy warships have sailed to a position about fifty nautical miles outside the port of Zha Pu, remotely observing, but are not enough to cause concern.</p>
<p>Minor Contact in Hongkou Area</p>
<p>According to confirmed news from the front line at 8:00 PM last night (the 26th), our army's defenses in the Hongkou area are arranged extremely solidly. In the past two days, the enemy has secretly crossed and landed at places such as Wusong. Therefore, they also frequently used ten squads there to feign attacks against our forces, partly to contain our forces and partly to test our army's defenses. Our army immediately returned fire, and the enemy fled back to their occupied fortifications in a panic. Our army is also strengthening its forces and maintaining strict vigilance. At present, the battle situation is only experiencing minor contact from time to time, and there are no changes in the front lines.</p>
<p>Our Planes Night-Raid and Bomb Enemy Positions</p>
<p>Our air force launched a night raid on enemy warships at approximately 2:00 AM yesterday morning. When our bombers, under the protection of fighter planes, flew over Shanghai, they dropped multiple bombs on enemy warships and positions in the Huangpu River. They then flew to Songkou to bomb enemy warships, causing extremely heavy losses to the enemy. Our planes returned safely after completing their mission.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The day before yesterday (the 25th) at approximately 5:00 PM, our army shot down an enemy plane with anti-aircraft machine guns northeast of [unclear character].</p>
<p>Accurate Statistics of Enemy Casualties</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" incident, it has been two weeks. According to accurate statistics, 3,580 enemy soldiers have been killed and more than 5,000 have been wounded. Our army's officer and soldier casualties are less than half of the enemy's. It is reported that in order to suppress military morale and prevent domestic public opposition, the enemy has always secretly concealed the actual number of dead and wounded soldiers. Most of the enemy's corpses have been disposed of in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Major Fire in Jiading City After Bombing</p>
<p>According to refugees who have just arrived in Shanghai from the Jiading area, enemy planes frequently bomb the Jiading city area. The County Chamber of Commerce area in the city was severely burned due to the enemy dropping incendiary bombs. There were also several fires outside the city. However, order within the city is still good, and most residents have taken refuge elsewhere, so there are no casualties. Luodian was engulfed in another major fire on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 25th), and the entire town was almost completely reduced to scorched earth.</p>
<p>Japan Denies Searching Soviet Consulate</p>
<p>The English-language North China Daily News reported that rumors were rife last night that Japanese soldiers had forcibly entered the Soviet Consulate in Shanghai to search it. This was denied today by the Japanese Embassy. However, it is understood that the Japanese authorities did apply to the Soviet Deputy Consul to investigate the signal lights at Xiamen. The Deputy Consul refused, saying that he must first obtain permission from the Soviet Ambassador.</p>
<p>Yongan Cotton Mill Mortgaged to American Business</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated a few days ago that the Yongan Cotton Mill in Wusong had presumptuously flown the American flag and allowed Chinese soldiers to lie in ambush inside the factory to attack Japanese soldiers. This was firmly denied last night by Mr. Guo, the general manager of the factory, who said that only two guards were left in the factory. As for why the American flag was flown, it was because the factory was mortgaged to the American company Shenchang Foreign Firm on June 27. It is heard that the American Consul General in Shanghai has informed the Chinese and Japanese military authorities that the factory is now American property and requested that the military be prevented from bombing it. Furthermore, the entire factory has taken out military insurance with an American company.</p>
<h3>Violation of International Conventions, Annihilation of Humanity, Enemy Gunfire Kills Rescue Personnel</h3>
<p>Red Cross Announces Details, We Telegraph League to Request Action</p>
<p>The Second Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society is stationed at the Southeast Medical College in Zhenru, with a Red Cross flag hanging at the entrance and team members wearing armbands. However, at 6:00 AM on August 18, Japanese planes dropped bombs and bombed the college. In addition to the destruction of the buildings in the college, stretcher team leader Zhang Songling was killed, and team leaders Xi Jichang, doctors, and team members Xu Zhende and others were injured. Furthermore, at 11:00 AM on August 19, the Third Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society in Nanxiang was bombed by Japanese planes, injuring deputy team leader Zhao Ruxin and three team members, and killing two wounded soldiers. Also, the First Rescue Team of the Chinese Red Cross Society stationed in Baoshan and Luodian, consisting of a total of 43 people, all wearing armbands, was working intensely at 4:00 PM on August 23 when they were suddenly confronted by many Japanese soldiers, who forcibly seized their armbands, ordered them to kneel on the ground, and shot them to death. A certain deputy team leader, a famous doctor, three team members, and the wounded soldiers they were rescuing were also shot and killed. Only Bian Minjian, Weng Ruyao, and Wang Fang[unclear character] escaped. Although female student Chen Xiufang, who was seriously injured, was rescued and sent to the Sino-German Hospital, she died of her injuries. The whereabouts of all other team members are unknown. A total of 30 Red Cross Society ambulances are working on the front lines. Car service personnel have repeatedly reported that when Japanese planes see vehicles with Red Cross flags, they drop bombs or use machine guns to strafe them, resulting in the destruction of seven vehicles. The Japanese army dared to bomb and shoot the International Red Cross Society of the American League, which is a violation of international conventions and will cause unease among Red Cross societies around the world. At this moment, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Liu Hongsheng, Lin Kanghou, and others of the association urgently telegraphed Ambassador Wang Zhengting stationed in the United Kingdom to submit this case to the Red Cross League and the World Red Cross Society for strict action.</p>
<h3>Capital's Air Defense is Thorough, Enemy Planes Have No Opportunity</h3>
<p>What Mr. Pinino, a Westerner, Said in Shanghai, He Witnessed Six Japanese Planes Being Shot Down</p>
<p>The Da Chen News reported that Mr. Pinino of the Nanjing Music Company arrived in Shanghai yesterday from Beijing and will take his wife back to Beijing next week. According to Mr. Pinino, the capital's air defense is very thorough, so it is safer than Shanghai. Japanese planes arrive in Beijing twice every day, but the damage caused by their bombers is minimal. Before the Japanese planes arrive, the entire city sounds the alarm, so the Japanese planes have no opportunity to take advantage of. He witnessed six Japanese planes being shot down and obtained pieces of the engine and wheels as souvenirs. There is ample food in the city, and only the price of rice has risen by 25%. The prices of other goods have not increased significantly. Almost all foreigners in Beijing have moved away, especially women and children, to places such as Shanghai, Guling, and Hankou. The Beijing-Shanghai railway tracks have not been damaged.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Strafe British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Suddenly Encountered Japanese Planes En Route to Shanghai, Vehicle Displayed British Flag But Still Shot At, Spinal Injury, Liver Also Hit, Currently Receiving Treatment at Hong En Hospital</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reported that Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, was traveling by car from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday when the car was bombed and strafed by Japanese planes 40 to 50 miles from Shanghai, seriously injuring the ambassador. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Details of the Japanese Plane Strafing</p>
<p>At 11:45 AM yesterday morning, the British Ambassador, accompanied by Military Attaché Fraser and Economic Advisor Bage, traveled from Beijing to Shanghai by road, traveling in two cars. The Ambassador's car was in front, and the car carrying the Military Attaché and others was behind. Both cars had the British flag displayed on the front radiator. At around 2:00 PM, when the cars were 40 to 50 miles from Shanghai, two Japanese planes suddenly flew low from the sky and chased after the Ambassador's car. The first plane immediately opened fire with machine guns, and the driver immediately stopped the car. The other plane continued to drop a bomb, which fortunately landed a little further away and did not destroy the car. At that time, Fraser, Bage, and the driver immediately jumped out of the car and lay on the ground. Because the British Ambassador was slower to move, he was shot by a machine gun as soon as he got out of the car, and was injured.</p>
<p>Ambassador's Injuries Quite Serious</p>
<p>Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the Japanese planes flew away. Fraser and others quickly helped the Ambassador back into the original car and rushed him to Shanghai. He arrived at 5:10 PM and was immediately taken to Hong En Hospital for treatment, where he was treated by British famous doctors Patton and Gatley. However, the Ambassador's spine was injured and his liver was also hit by bullets. He had lost a lot of blood along the way, so he was given a blood transfusion immediately after arriving at the hospital. He had not yet undergone surgery to remove the bullets by the evening.</p>
<p>Mayor Sends Condolences on Behalf of Chiang</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news of the Ambassador's injury, Mayor Yu immediately sent Secretary Tang Shixuan to the hospital to offer condolences at 6:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Then, at 7:30 PM in the evening, Yu himself went to the hospital to convey the condolences of Chairman Chiang. Yang Hu, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, also sent someone to the hospital last night at 8:00 PM to express his condolences. It is noted that the British Ambassador came to Beijing from Beidaihe last month after the Lugouqiao Incident to negotiate peace and worked diligently. He came to Shanghai this time and was also planning to mediate for peace, but was instead shot and injured by Japanese planes. People from all walks of life in our country express deep regret and sympathy for the British Ambassador.</p>
<p>British Greatly Indignant</p>
<p>After the news of the British Ambassador being shot by Japanese planes spread, the British side was greatly indignant. It is heard that representatives from the Japanese Embassy in China and Honda, the naval attaché, and representatives from the Third Fleet Commander went to the British Embassy that night to express their apologies.</p>
<h3>Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, British Ambassador</h3>

Both cars were displaying the British flag. The Ambassador was injured in the back and was taken to Hong En Hospital in Shanghai for treatment.

<p>Capital City Residents in Shock</p>
<p>Reuters, Nanjing, 26th Central News Agency: The capital city was shocked after British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked and injured by Japanese planes on the Beijing-Shanghai Highway. Immediately, Yu Ming, the director of the Nanjing Foreign Ministry's Shanghai office, went to Hong En Hospital in Shanghai on behalf of Chairman Chiang and Foreign Minister Wang to offer condolences. The Foreign Minister has also telegraphed British Foreign Secretary Eden to express his regrets.</p>
<p>All of Britain in Uproar</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th Central News Agency: Since the news of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being attacked and injured by Japanese planes arrived, all of Britain has been in an uproar. All the evening newspapers in London have published this news with large headlines and printed photos taken at the station of the Ambassador and his wife before they left England for China. The public rushed to buy them, showing great concern. However, there has been no official statement so far, and a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom expressed deep regret to Reuters reporters and said that it was particularly regrettable that the British Ambassador was mediating a major mission at this time, preventing him from carrying out his duties. It is noted that Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen is 51 years old and was appointed Ambassador to China in mid-September last year. He previously served as Minister to Iran and Latvia.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th Central News Agency: Politicians and public opinion here are extremely indignant at the news that British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was attacked and injured by Japanese planes. Regarding this incident, the Foreign Office has not yet received a formal report, and the details are not yet clear. However, politicians believe that even if Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's life is not in danger, the impact of this incident will not be small.</p>
<p>German Authorities Pay Close Attention</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 26th Central News Agency: Regarding the British Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being attacked and injured by Japanese planes, newspapers here have recently published it with large headlines, calling it a 'serious incident in Shanghai.' The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated, 'This incident will make the situation in the Far East increasingly complicated, but it may not necessarily lead to tragic consequences. It is obvious that Britain has always tried to avoid taking a tough stance against Japan. The escalation of the situation in the Far East is incompatible with the British political program, because the situation in the Mediterranean has not yet calmed down, the United States is unwilling to get involved, and Britain's Eastern policy is not yet ready.' The Berliner Tageblatt stated, 'Since the outbreak of the conflict between China and Japan, the governments of Britain, the United States, and France have been quite anxious and have repeatedly sought to eliminate it. Now that the British Ambassador has been seriously injured, the situation in the Far East will have a rapid evolution, it can be asserted.'</p>
<p>Condition Still Unchanged</p>
<p>Reuters News from this city: Regarding the British Ambassador's condition, the hospital released a message at 11:50, stating that the Ambassador is now able to sleep peacefully and is in very good condition. Also, as of 0:30 this morning, there have been no changes. When the surgery to remove the bullets will be performed is still to be determined by the doctors. Yu Ming, the director of the Foreign Ministry's Shanghai office, went to the hospital last night to offer condolences on behalf of Foreign Minister Wang.</p>
<p>News at 4:00 AM this morning: British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen had a good recovery after a blood transfusion last night. As of 5:00 AM this morning, he is sleeping peacefully and there is currently no dangerous situation.</p>

<h3>Violating International Maritime Law, the Enemy Blockades Our Sea Ports</h3>
<p>In reality, it has no effect on us; Various countries will lodge serious protests.</p>
<p>Hasegawa, the commander of the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy in Shanghai, announced the blockade of our southeastern sea ports. A reporter inquired with our country's shipping circles. According to them, this was only seen reported in a certain foreign newspaper in this city. According to the longitude and latitude listed for the blockade area announced by the commander of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, it extends from Jiangyin on the Yangtze River, to Wusong in Shanghai, the coastal areas of Zhejiang, Zhenhai in Ningbo, the Zhoushan Islands, the port of Wenzhou, Quanzhou in Fujian, and as far as Shantou and Chaozhou, encompassing the coasts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong provinces. The line from South China to the Yangtze River is also within the blockade range. From the date of the blockade announcement, any Chinese ships encountered within this blockade area will be shelled, and they can be harassed at any time and any place. Our country's shipping circles anticipated this point before the war began. All ships in South China had already stopped sailing on their own, and the Yangtze River even blockaded the Jiangyin port. Therefore, this blockade policy has no impact on us and brings absolutely no benefit to them.</p>
<p>The reporter also visited a person in charge of a certain foreign shipping company. According to them, they had also only seen this reported in foreign newspapers and had not yet received an official notice from the Japanese side. However, since China and Japan have not formally declared war, according to international practice, the Japanese should not rashly blockade Chinese sea ports. Although the currently blockaded area is limited to the section from South China to the mouth of the Yangtze River, many ships from various countries operate within this line. This action by the Japanese clearly violates international norms and hinders the interests of various countries. All countries will lodge a stern protest with the Japanese side.</p>
<p>Regarding the actions of the Japanese Navy at the Wusong port in Shanghai, since the 20th of this month, Chinese ships have been prohibited from traveling to and from there. They have even strictly refused the entry and exit of the refugee transport ships jointly operated by the Municipal Council and the Ningbo Fellow Association. Repeated negotiations have failed to secure permission. Furthermore, from 5:00 PM every day until 8:00 AM the next morning, no foreign ship is allowed to pass through the Wusong port, which is effectively blockaded by the Japanese Navy. This has created various obstacles for foreign ships carrying refugees from Shanghai, causing deep dissatisfaction among various countries, who have also made serious representations to the Japanese side.</p>
<h3>Guo Taiqi's Remarks</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 26th - Guo Taiqi, China's ambassador to the UK, stated to Reuters reporters today that Japan's blockade of Chinese sea ports further proves that Japan, in its large-scale war of aggression against China, is attempting to completely conquer China according to its plan. However, all countries should understand that Japan's goal in China is merely a means to complete its plan, as Japan intends to establish hegemony in the Pacific region after acquiring China's labor and resources. Currently, countries around the world either express their inability to protect their interests or lack the active desire to do so. China alone is exhausting its resources to contend with the strong enemy. China's resistance is not only fighting for its own survival but also upholding justice for all countries in the world directly affected by Japan's lawlessness and ambition. Guo also stated that relevant countries have been unable to prevent Japan from using public concessions as military bases, failing to maintain absolute neutrality, and failing to uphold their treaty obligations to China. Therefore, the current tragic situation in the Far East is caused by the complete disintegration of international law and order, as well as the sanctity of treaties, since Japan seized Manchuria six years ago.</p>
<h3>Serious Repercussions in the US and France</h3>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 26th - The United States has taken a serious view of the Japanese Navy's blockade of Chinese sea ports and fears that Japan will find it difficult to draw a line between Chinese and foreign commercial shipping. The New York Times stated that if Japan detains foreign ships, President Roosevelt will find it difficult to avoid declaring a state of war. Havas, Paris, 26th - Lieutenant General Hasegawa, commander of the Second Fleet of the Japanese Navy, issued a declaration in Shanghai yesterday prohibiting Chinese ships from sailing along the coast south of the Yangtze River in China. According to reports here, the Japanese authorities have also claimed that they reserve the right to order foreign ships sailing along the Chinese coast to stop at any time to verify their nationality. Official sources here believe that this statement is unlikely to be reliable. If Japan adopts such an attitude, it will inevitably cause serious international repercussions. Japan may have the right to search Chinese ships, but it certainly cannot search foreign ships. Moreover, according to international maritime law, to implement a blockade, it must be done after a formal declaration of war. Japan must notify all neutral countries before doing so. China and Japan have not formally declared war, and the Japanese government has not notified various countries of the implementation of the blockade.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 26th - The right-wing newspaper Figaro recently commented on the Far Eastern situation, "Japan is currently carrying out its planned war in China. This plan may seem unsystematic on the surface, but it has been prepared for a long time. Its purpose in fighting in Shanghai is to undermine the prestige of the Chinese government and prevent China from obtaining military supplies and food from the sea. In short, Japan is determined to control the Shanghai sea port. The reason for the failure of the British government's proposal for the neutralization of Shanghai lies precisely in this. At present, it is virtually impossible to import military supplies and food into China from Shanghai. The key question now is whether Guangzhou will take Shanghai's place. If so, Japanese warships will undoubtedly have to blockade the Pearl River as well. Japan has established naval and air bases in the Penghu Islands, which are not far from Guangzhou. Blockading the Pearl River is not difficult. However, Hong Kong and the Pearl River are as closely related as lips and teeth, and Hong Kong is a fortress and treasury of the British Empire in the Far East. If the Pearl River is blockaded, Hong Kong will also be in dire straits. The consequences of this are likely to be significant."</p>
<p>Hong Kong Merchants Feel Deeply Uneasy</p>
<p>Reuters, Hong Kong, 26th - The Japanese maritime blockade of Chinese ships is considered by business circles here to be the most disturbing development since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, and Hong Kong's commerce is bound to suffer greatly. The English-language "Great American Evening Post" stated that, according to Dr. Shinobo, a legal advisor to the Third Fleet of the Japanese Navy and a professor of international law, although foreign warships cannot be seized, detained, or forced to change their course after the Japanese fleet implements the blockade of Chinese waters, Japanese naval authorities may board ships to verify their nationality if they suspect it. Chinese ships sailing in the prohibited area will be detained, regardless of whether they are carrying munitions or military supplies. Because this is not a wartime blockade, it cannot prevent foreign ships from carrying munitions to China. However, if we discover that foreign ships are carrying wartime contraband, we can take effective measures to exercise pre-emption rights. It was also announced by Japanese authorities to news reporters this morning that Chinese ships captured by Japanese forces would be detained, not confiscated or sunk. As for whether the cargo they carry will be regarded as contraband, a decision has yet to be made. Ships flying foreign flags will not be stopped, and no steps have yet been taken to declare any contraband.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Circulates Funds to the Interior</h3>
<p>Circular Orders the Four Banks to Establish a Joint Discount Committee</p>
<p>Since the announcement of the measures to stabilize finance, the Ministry of Finance, in order to maintain the circulation of funds for agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining in the interior, has issued a circular to the Joint Office of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank, ordering them to establish joint offices in important cities where they have branches.

<h3>Encouraging Term Deposit Customers to Subscribe to National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>The Citizens' Association suggests withdrawing one-tenth of deposits; Overseas Chinese have already remitted 650,000 for bonds</p>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Association believes that since the full-scale war of resistance has begun, the government has also decided to issue National Salvation Bonds in order to strengthen its economic power. The association believes that in addition to the methods stipulated by the government, term deposit customers of various banks can be encouraged to allocate one-tenth of their term deposit amount to purchase National Salvation Bonds. This would not result in any loss for the depositors and would be easier to achieve in terms of fundraising. The association has already drafted a plan for this measure and suggested that the government adopt and implement it. It is believed that term deposit customers will also be happy to support it.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the General Committee for Fundraising National Salvation Bonds has only been established for a few days and has already received eleven remittances from overseas Chinese through the Guangdong Bank for underwriting National Salvation Bonds, totaling 650,083 yuan and 47 cents. This is sufficient to demonstrate the patriotism of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>National Salvation Bonds with an Annual Interest Rate of Two Percent</h3>
<p>Regulations Have Been Submitted for Revision</p>
<p>Since the General Committee for Fundraising National Salvation Bonds has been established, the internal organization has been put in order, and the work is being carried out very diligently. Various banks and postal remittance bureaus in this city have been entrusted to collect funds on its behalf, and branches have been established in various places at home and abroad to raise funds. The regulations have been submitted for revision and have been slightly modified compared to the first draft. The bonds originally had no interest but have now been changed to an annual interest rate of two percent. The regulations are listed below:</p>
<p>Regulations for National Salvation Bonds</p>
<p>Article 1: The National Government, in order to encourage the people to pool their financial resources and contribute to national salvation expenses, issues public bonds, named National Salvation Bonds. Article 2: Any individual or organization that contributes cash or valuable items for national salvation shall be given these bonds according to the amount contributed. Article 3: The total amount of these bonds is 500 million yuan, issued at par value on September 1, 1937. Article 4: These bonds shall have an annual interest rate of two percent, which shall be paid once every year at the end of August, starting from 1938. Article 5: The principal of these bonds shall be repaid starting from 1941, in thirty years. Each year, a lottery shall be drawn to repay the principal. Article 6: The fund for repaying the principal and interest of these bonds shall be allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury revenue. Article 7: The bonds shall be divided into denominations of 10,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan, all of which shall be in bearer form. Article 8: The Ministry of Finance shall entrust an agency to raise funds for these bonds and announce it to the public. Article 9: Anyone who forges these bonds or damages their credit shall be punished by the judicial authorities according to law. Article 10: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of approval.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegram to Hangzhou Hoping for Resumption of Business</h3>
<p>Consolidate the rear front; Enhance the strength of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Hangzhou Municipal Government and the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, stating, "Respectfully to Mayor Zhou of the Hangzhou Municipal Government, Chairman Xie of the Hangzhou Chamber of Commerce, and all committee members. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Shanghai market once stagnated. Subsequently, our chamber tried every means to persuade and guide the financial, transportation, food, and pawn industries to resume business one after another. Other industries gradually restored order, and people's hearts gradually stabilized. Our chamber's chairman, Yu Xiaolai, also issued a statement hoping that workers and staff would work together in the same boat to reduce unemployment panic, maintain a minimum standard of living, and prepare for a prolonged war of resistance. It is heard that Hangzhou is still stagnant, which is deeply concerning. It is believed that plans for resuming business are already underway, and consolidating the rear front will also enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce begs for forgiveness."</p>

<h3>Extremely Tense Situation in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Evacuate in Batches; War Seems Imminent</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Since the De County Road Incident occurred in this city on the 14th of this month, the atmosphere has been extremely tense, as if a major war is imminent. Citizens are fleeing Qingdao to take refuge, and shops have successively closed. Chinese and foreign factories have also suspended operations. Japanese residents are evacuating in batches, revealing widespread unease and the increasingly perilous state of affairs. The Japanese side's youth groups, veterans associations, reservists, student soldiers, and volunteer corps in Qingdao are taking very active measures, and war seems imminent. A summary of the situation in recent days is compiled below:</p>
<p>Total Evacuation of Japanese Residents</p>
<p>There are approximately 14,000 to 15,000 Japanese residents engaged in business in Qingdao. Adding those who have recently evacuated to Qingdao from the Yangtze River area and Jinan, the total is nearly 20,000. Japanese residents who have evacuated from other ports have been returning to Japan in batches by ship. Japanese residents doing business in Qingdao have recently been ordered to evacuate as well. However, these Japanese residents all have considerable property in Qingdao. Once ordered to cease operations and return to their country, the magnitude of their losses and the problems of their future livelihood are incalculable. Therefore, complaints have arisen, and all express great indignation. Some even weep with grief, steadfastly refusing to return and willing to share the fate of their assets. However, compelled by military orders, they have no choice but to board ships with sorrow. Consequently, tragic events have been frequently reported. According to investigations, the Dalian Maru, Qingdao Maru, and Miura Maru, which sailed from Qingdao to Moji, Japan, on the 9th, carried more than 30 Japanese residents. The Changcheng Maru, Jingguo Maru, Ukishima Maru, Nikko Maru, Kokuryu Maru, Jiao Shan Maru, and Lushan Maru, which departed on the 20th, carried more than 5,000 Japanese residents. It is said that the remaining Japanese residents will be completely evacuated within three days.</p>
<p>Japanese Actively Preparing for War</p>
<p>Since the De County Road Incident occurred, the Japanese consulate has telegraphed its home country, requesting that a large number of warships be sent to Qingdao. The Japanese veterans stationed in Qingdao are all eager to fight, but because of their numerical disadvantage, they have not dared to start a conflict lightly. Currently, there are five Japanese warships in Qingdao, each with approximately 300 to 400 sailors. Recently, the Japanese have repeatedly used Chinese-made trucks to transport extremely heavy wooden boxes, storing them in cotton mills such as Gongda, the Japanese shrine on Liaoning Road, and Japanese shops and residences in the market area. It is said that these wooden boxes are all munitions, unloaded from the wharf and transported to designated locations for storage, in preparation for wartime use. Our municipal authorities have detected their plot and ordered their subordinates to be on strict alert, ready to strike them severely when necessary.</p>
<h3>British Troops Increase Defense on the North Bank of Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 1:00 PM, the commander of the British troops stationed in Shanghai dispatched soldiers to increase the defense on the north bank of Suzhou Creek. These British soldiers were dressed in dark green uniforms, wore steel helmets, and carried simple luggage. They rode in five trucks, each with approximately 20 to 30 soldiers, led by officers. The trucks drove to the entrance of the First Special District Court on North Zhejiang Road, stopping for a short while. After the location was decided, three trucks of soldiers got off the trucks and lined up to enter the court for garrison. The remaining two trucks then transported materials to the temporary barracks on Ala Bashi Road, Kaifeng Road for rest. At night, all went to the defense lines for guard duty.</p>
<h3>New Timetable for the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau is sparing no effort to maintain transportation. It has been preparing to run Beijing-Hangzhou passenger trains four times in recent days. The trains depart from Shanghai West Station in good order. Yesterday, however, enemy aircraft bombed and damaged the tracks, causing the Shanghai-Hangzhou train scheduled to depart at 8:00 AM to be delayed. An engineering train was dispatched to repair the damage, and the train departed at 4:00 PM. Other trains departed on time. The railway also finalized the Beijing-Shanghai train timetable yesterday, effective today. The details are recorded below: Beijing-Shanghai Express trains operate twice in both directions.

<h3>British Government Determined to Protect Interests in China</h3>
<p>Effectively Protect the Lives and Property of British Nationals; Welcomes the U.S. Government's Call for a Ceasefire; Britain, France, and the United States Maintain Close Cooperation</p>
<p>[London] Prime Minister Chamberlain returned to Beijing from Scotland this morning and immediately conferred with Foreign Secretary Eden and Lord President of the Council Halifax on the Shanghai war in the morning. He then held a second conversation at 5:00 PM, which lasted until 6:30 PM. A communiqué was issued afterward stating, "The Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, and the Lord President of the Council, after discussing the matter, expressed their support for the various measures that the government has already implemented and decided to adopt all effective measures to protect the lives and property of British nationals." The communiqué denied rumors that the British government intended to withdraw all British nationals from Shanghai, and stated, "The government is still working to exclude Shanghai from the war zone. To date, the government has issued notices to both China and Japan, stating that each country will be responsible for any damage to the lives and property of British nationals caused by the war. The government has also protested to the Tokyo government regarding the occupation of British property in the International Settlement by Japanese troops and reserves the right to demand double compensation for damages. In addition, the U.S. government has expressed concern that the war between China and Japan is greatly detrimental to the general situation in the Far East, which is shared in Britain. The U.S. Secretary of State Hull's call for the countries to cease fighting is particularly welcomed by Britain. In short, other countries, especially France and the United States, are closely cooperating with Britain, and Prime Minister Chamberlain and others are very pleased and believe that this cooperation is necessary for continued progress." Chamberlain went to Balmoral tonight to meet with King George VI to report to the King on the situation in the Far East and relations between Britain and Italy.

<p>[New York] Under Secretary of State Welles recently took his family aboard the British mail steamer Queen Mary to Europe. It is said that this trip is a vacation, and he will return home on the 27th of next month.

<p>[London] It is learned that the British authorities in Shanghai have withdrawn 3,500 women and children and 300 men from the country's expatriate community. Currently, there are few British expatriates in Shanghai requesting withdrawal, so there is no need to send more mail ships to Shanghai to welcome the withdrawal of expatriates. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>[London] After U.S. Secretary of State Hull made a statement two days ago, urging China and Japan to stop the war, The Times commented, "Although the wording of this statement is very mild, the attitude it expresses is more resolute than some of the public opinion in the country expected. Unfortunately, Japan seems to have decided to stage a tragedy in China, which may not be easily brought to a successful conclusion by Britain and the United States. As far as China's military equipment is concerned, it is far better than in 1932. The country now also has an air force, and although its quantity is not as large as Japan's, its equipment is extremely sophisticated in certain aspects and has achieved great results in various places, especially in Nanjing. In addition, the Su-Er connection has connected the Beijing-Shanghai line with the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. The Chinese military authorities can now use this railway militarily. The invaders must have the power to surround the suburbs of Shanghai in order to control the railway line between Shanghai, Jiaxing, and Suzhou, which is no easy task." (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>[London] The Times reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, and Lord President of the Council Halifax discussed the Far East crisis, and it is expected that Japan's invasion of China this month is aimed at monopolizing China. This plan puts the position of all countries, especially Britain, in great danger. Just in Hongkou and Yangshupu, British capital losses have reached 180 million pounds. The report continued that the Sino-Japanese conflict has greatly affected China's customs revenue. Customs revenue is approximately 20 million pounds per year, of which 4.5 million pounds is used to pay interest on Chinese government bonds, and most of these bonds are in the hands of the British. (National Maritime Telegraph, 26th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Stampa recently commented on the situation between China and Japan, slightly noting that Britain's interests and prestige in the Far East will be greatly affected. "If Japan's plan is indeed aimed at controlling the coastal ports of China, from Tianjin in the north to Guangzhou in the south, including Shanghai, can Britain use appropriate means to deal with this threat? Some say that Britain still hopes to cooperate with the United States, but the evolution of the situation is changing rapidly, and it cannot be resolved by U.S. Secretary of State Hull's call for a ceasefire or President Roosevelt's emphasis on the principle of maintaining the Open Door Policy in China."

<h3>Italian Warships Sail to Shanghai</h3>
<p>⊙Genoa: The cruiser Montecuccoli, belonging to the 6th Division of the Second Fleet of the Italian Navy, set sail for Shanghai today to strengthen the Italian Navy's forces in the Far East and protect the lives and property of Italian citizens.

<h3>Britain and the United States Pay Attention to the Situation in Qingdao</h3>
<p>Deeply Concerned About the Outbreak of War</p>
<p>[London] The British government is now concerned that the Sino-Japanese war will extend to Qingdao, which will endanger the lives and property of many foreigners there. It has contacted the U.S. government. The British diplomatic representative in Nanjing has been ordered to express to the Chinese and Japanese authorities that the British government is very concerned about the extension of the war to Qingdao. The British diplomatic representative in China has also been ordered to support U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson. It is heard that Johnson has also made representations to the Chinese authorities regarding the Qingdao matter. (Central News Agency, Reuters Dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Japan Asks Germany for Loans to Buy Munitions</h3>
<p>500,000,000 Yuan</p>
<p>[Berlin] German business circles are now hoping to receive a large number of orders from Japan. According to German export merchants, the Japanese government has requested Germany to lend 500 million yen, equivalent to approximately 400 million marks, to be used to purchase military supplies from Germany. If this transaction is successful, the losses suffered by German trade with China since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict will be compensated. In the first half of 1937, Chinese goods imported into Germany amounted to more than 41 million marks, while German goods exported to China amounted to approximately 78 million marks. It is expected that the losses in German trade with China in the second half of this year will be very large. Until recently, German ships sailing to the Far East loaded and unloaded half of their import and export goods in Shanghai. However, German shipping companies have ordered these ships not to stop in Shanghai anymore, but to stop in Hong Kong and Tianjin instead, because Germany believes that Shanghai has now been blocked or blockaded by the Japanese military. Moreover, after the Chinese market is closed, Germany can no longer import various raw materials from China, especially metals. Therefore, Germany has had to purchase raw materials from other countries at higher prices. (Central News Agency, Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>There Are Still More Than 60,000 Refugees in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Urgently Need Relief and Repatriation</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, refugees have flocked to the concessions. The Shanghai Relief Committee and other fellow-provincial associations have been receiving and repatriating them separately. How many refugees are there as of now? This survey is extremely important. According to a reporter's investigation yesterday, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai still has more than 7,000 people besides those who have been repatriated. Other fellow-provincial associations, such as those from Shaoxing, Yuyao, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Haining, Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Hai'an, Qidong, and the seven counties of Yangzhou, have received more than 20,000 people. The Municipal Relief Committee has received a total of 19,316 people. Including those scattered on the streets and at the wharves, there should be no less than 5,000 to 6,000. In total, there are approximately 60,000 refugees in Shanghai. How to enable them to return to their hometowns is indeed a major problem.</p>
<h3>Mayor Yu's Wife Offers Condolences and Raises Funds</h3>
<p>Raised More Than 8,000 Yuan; Visited Hospitals in Person to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war of resistance, Mayor Yu's wife has united with the women of this city to launch fundraising and condolence activities for the rear area. Mayor Yu's wife personally raised more than 8,000 yuan and handed it over to the responsible organization for comforting wounded soldiers and relieving refugees. Mayor Yu's wife has also been visiting various wounded soldier hospitals in recent days to offer condolences to the wounded soldiers. She will continue to carry out fundraising activities in the future.</p>
<h3>Strict Prohibition of Private Requisition of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Notice from the Municipal Police Bureau</p>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau issued a notice yesterday to strictly prohibit the private requisition of military supplies. The notice stated that, as the war is currently in full swing, the bureau's requisition of military supplies on behalf of the front-line troops will be carried out in accordance with the prescribed procedures, with formal receipts issued. Once the war is over, the government will be requested to provide appropriate compensation to show sympathy. However, it has been repeatedly reported that recently, in various districts under the bureau's jurisdiction, local thugs have been falsely using the names of the police and local teams to privately requisition military supplies, taking the opportunity to defraud property. Such reckless behavior is extremely hateful. In addition to strictly ordering subordinates to arrest and hand over such individuals at any time, citizens who discover the above situation should immediately report it to the bureau. Once verified, they will be severely punished. This notice is hereby issued for general information.</p>
<h3>Belgian Ambassador to China Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the envoys of China and Belgium were promoted to ambassadors, the Belgian government appointed the envoy to China, Mr. Jiumu Ji, as ambassador. Mr. Ji was recuperating in Beijing and was ordered to return to his post a month ago. He arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and will visit our authorities in Beijing within days to present his credentials.</p>
<h3>Two Relief Organizations Received Reporters Yesterday</h3>
<p>Report on Preparations and Visit to the Relief Hospital</p>
<p>The General Red Cross Society of China and the Municipal Relief Committee hosted the press community of this city at the Pudong Fellow-Provincial Association at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the relief situation for wounded soldiers and civilians and to visit various relief hospitals in the city. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Mr. Pang Reported on the Preparations</p>
<p>At the reception, Mr. Pang Jingzhou reported on: ㊀ the preparation process; ㊁ the establishment of 13 relief hospitals and 13 contracted hospitals, with 3,000 beds currently available, which are planned to be expanded to 4,000 within a week; ㊂ the establishment of six relief teams and three first aid teams; ㊃ the fundraising situation and its distribution and use; ㊄ the activities of the Red Cross Society in North China and various counties in the Shanghai suburbs. Finally, Mr. Pang hoped that: ㊀ all sectors should trust experts; ㊁ all sectors should do their best to assist in the relief of wounded soldiers; ㊂ all sectors should pay attention to the practical benefits of comforting the wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>The Relief Hospitals Are Well-Equipped</p>
<p>The association then dispatched staff to accompany the reporters to visit six relief hospitals, including the Commodities Exchange, Xiaoming Girls' High School, the Catholic Church, Aurora University, the Poor People's Education Center, and the Vienna Garden Ballroom. The gates of each hospital were heavily guarded, and the order was good. After explaining the situation to the hosts, they inspected each ward for a week. Due to time constraints, they could not stay long. The wounds of the wounded soldiers in each hospital were still light. The Vienna ward was located in the ballroom, and the light and air were good. Some patients were sitting quietly on the grass to enjoy the cool. The place was jointly operated by the Machinery Association and the National Businessmen's Association, and the supplies were adequate, and there were many service personnel, including many dancers, who were responsible for nursing. Their patriotic sincerity was admirable. The Catholic Church and Aurora University both had well-equipped operating rooms. When the reporters visited, they were performing surgeries, so they did not stay long for fear of hindering the surgeries. The lives of the wounded soldiers were very disciplined. Nurses provided newspapers and wrote letters for them, giving them a lot of spiritual comfort. In order to maintain their orderly lives, the association politely declined external condolence gifts and excessive services, believing that more spiritual comfort should be given to the wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>Military Law Strictly Punishes Profiteering Rice Merchants</h3>
<p>Proclamation by the Martial Law Headquarters</p>
<p>Yang Hu, the Martial Law Commander of Shanghai, recently issued Proclamation No. 17, stating that: "The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Letter No. 78 stated that, 'Since the outbreak of the war in this city, regarding the issue of public food, the bureau has jointly organized the Shanghai Citizens' Adjustment Committee with the city's military and police organs, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, local associations, the Banking Association, and various rice industry groups to comprehensively plan and sell at fair prices to maintain public food. At this critical time, we are deeply concerned that unscrupulous merchants will hoard and speculate, manipulate prices, or take the opportunity to steal rice, endangering public food. We are hereby sending a letter to inform you and hope that you will promptly issue a proclamation that if any unscrupulous merchants are found to be hoarding and speculating, raising prices, or stealing rice, they will be severely punished in accordance with military law in order to maintain public food and ensure public safety.' This is approved. The matters stated are factual and should be handled accordingly. A proclamation is hereby issued for the public to know that if any unscrupulous merchants are found to be hoarding and speculating, raising prices, or stealing rice, they will be severely punished in accordance with military law, and there will be no leniency. All should comply."</p>
<h3>Silver and Banking Industries Closed Today for Confucius' Birthday</h3>
<p>Today is Confucius' birthday. The Jianghai Customs will be closed all day. The local post offices will also follow the Sunday office hours. The parcel, savings, and remittance departments will be closed. The silver and banking industries in this city will also stop collecting and disbursing funds and will be closed for one day. The sacrificial ceremony will not be held due to the current situation.</p>
<h3>Post Office Re-Announces Collection of Mail from the War Zone</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued another notice yesterday stating that the postal branch in the Construction Building at 171 Jiangxi Road is still selling stamps and accepting ordinary registered and express letters as usual. In addition, the bureau re-announced that senders of express letters north of Suzhou Creek can collect them at the Jiangxi Road branch, ordinary letters at the Jing'an Temple Road branch, and registered letters at the Gongguan Road branch to avoid backlog.</p>
<h3>Yunnan Fellow-Provincials Register to Be Sent Back Home</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in Shanghai, air routes have been cut off, and remittances are not possible. Yunnan fellow-provincials in Shanghai (including students) are looking forward to Kunming, separated by thousands of miles, and their calls for help have not been answered. The future is particularly worrying. Yesterday, I met with a person in charge of the general affairs section of the Yunnan Fellow-Provincial Association in Shanghai. According to him, the association is preparing to provide funds for fellow-provincials in Shanghai to return home and has contacted a British shipping company to book berths. It is hoped that all fellow-provincials will quickly register with Mr. Chen Jincan at the Comfort Goods Collection Point of the Anti-Japanese Support Association of Guangxia Middle School at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Moore Road within two days in order to prepare berths and depart as soon as possible. Late registration will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Zhu Gongquan, Manager of American-Funded Textile Company, Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Fortunately, He Had Life Insurance; Able to Provide for Life and Death</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Gongquan, manager of the American-funded Meifeng Textile Company in this city, died at 4:00 PM on the 14th of this month. While driving his private car on official business in front of the Great World on Edward Avenue, he was hit by a bomb dropped from an airplane, severing his left leg. He was sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment, but he died two hours later due to his injuries. Mr. Zhu originally lived on Gongping Road in Hongkou. Only after the outbreak of the war in Shanghai did he escape with his family and reside in the French Concession. Unfortunately, he encountered this disaster. Moreover, Mr. Zhu had parents over 70 years old and a wife and five children, whose education and upbringing required funds. Fortunately, Mr. Zhu had a life insurance policy of 10,000 yuan with the Huaan Mutual Aid Insurance Company. After the incident, the company investigated and verified the facts. Mr. Zhu's family has received the full amount of compensation, which can be used to provide for life and death. The family is grateful for this benefit and has published a thank-you note to the company in the newspaper.</p>
<h3>Yenching University Establishes a Liaison Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Peiping and Tianjin and postal and telegraph communications were cut off, the situation at Yenching University has been unknown here. It is learned that Mr. Xie Jingsheng, secretary of the university, established a temporary liaison office of Yenching University in Shanghai at 319, near the intersection of Maixi Ai Road and Huanlong Road in the French Concession, in view of the increasing number of Yenching University teachers and students coming to Shanghai. It is also learned that the Shanghai Admissions Office of the university issued a notice for fear that the candidates were anxious about whether they were admitted. The notice was mailed to each student. The notice is hereby copied as follows: "Dear Sir/Madam, since Peiping and Tianjin have fallen and communications have been cut off, the entrance examination for new students held by our university in Shanghai last month and the examination papers have not yet been sent. All matters relating to the evaluation of the examination papers are temporarily suspended. In addition to carefully preserving the documents for future review, this notice is hereby given. Please note."</p>
<h3>News from Hui Qun Girls' School</h3>
<p>The Hui Qun Girls' Primary and Secondary School and Kindergarten in Tilanqiao were completely destroyed on the 10th of this month. Principal Wang, considering that the original 500 students were scattered in the British and French Concessions, and in order to facilitate the students' collection of graduation certificates, transfer certificates, and study loan certificates, has negotiated with the Hua Dong Republic Girls' School in the British and French Concessions to borrow a place to study. Students can enter the designated school to study with a study loan certificate without having to go through an entrance examination, which is the same as entering the original school. It is very convenient. A temporary office has been set up at 500 Luban Road, Pubo Road in the French Concession. The school's students can contact them as soon as possible so that their studies will not be affected.</p>

<h3>The Enemy Employs Full Force to Attack Coastal Ports along the Yangtze, Our Army and Air Force Launch a Large-Scale Encirclement</h3>
<p>Our forces are heavily garrisoned at various points along the coast, vowing to annihilate the stubborn enemy in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>The battle situation for the past two days has remained focused on various ports along the Yangtze River and the coast, especially the Liuhang and Luodian areas, which are the most critical. The situation is as follows: ㊀ Nanhui and Chuansha are clear of enemy traces. ㊁ Along the Wusong town, Zhanghuabang, Wenzaobang and along the Huangpu River, there are still a few remnants of the enemy, resisting stubbornly under the encirclement of our army. ㊂ Between the northeast coast of Luodian and Liuhang, a significant number of enemy troops continue to land, attempting to break through our lines of defense with all their strength in that area, in order to relieve the siege of Shanghai. Our forces are now heavily garrisoned at various points along the coast, having encircled the enemy, and aiming to annihilate the stubborn enemy in a short period of time.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, as per reports received from the front lines this afternoon, the enemy troops who landed at various coastal ports earlier, except for a few remnants in the Zhanghuabang and the Shenqiao, Mujiaoqiao and Chenjiahang areas northwest of Luodian, are being cleared. The rest of the areas are clear of enemy traces. As for the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, they are very calm and there is no intense fighting. The battle lines on both sides have also remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Launches Bombing Raids</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from military authorities, our air force dispatched dozens of aircraft this morning to launch large-scale bombing raids in order to assist our army's general offensive.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Continue to Land at Liuhang</h3>
<p>Dozens of enemy ships unleash fierce artillery fire.</p>
<p>According to those who returned to Shanghai from the front lines at 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy troops in the Luodian area, after being besieged by our army for two days and nights, have retreated to an area approximately eight or nine *hua li* outside Luodian town. They continued to resist stubbornly last night and this morning. At the same time, dozens of enemy ships unleashed intense artillery fire from Paotaiwan along the riverbanks of Baoshan, Shizilin, Xiaochuansha, and Liuhang, providing cover for furtive landings at various locations.</p>
<h3>Part of the Enemy Force Lands at the Mouth of Wusong</h3>
<p>Our forces concentrate firepower for sweeping fire; fierce fighting continues until noon.</p>
<p>According to confirmed reports, part of the enemy force landed at the mouth of Wusong at approximately 2:00 AM this morning. Our forces immediately concentrated firepower and engaged in brave sweeping fire. Fierce fighting continued until noon.</p>
<p>In the Wusong area, several hundred enemy remnants are entrenched in the area east of the town along the banks of the river, while our forces are on high alert west of the town, awaiting the opportunity to advance and annihilate them.</p>
<h3>No Enemy Traces Northeast of Luodian</h3>
<p>Approximately Two Thousand People Still in Northwest Area</p>
<p>According to Wang Yuwu, the District Chief of Luodian who arrived in Shanghai from the south at 10:00 AM today (the 27th), there are no enemy traces northeast of Luodian. In the Shenqiao, Mujiaozhen and Chenjiahang area northwest of Luodian, there are still approximately two thousand enemy troops, who are currently encircled by our forces. In the Xiaochuansha area, the enemy seems to be constructing fortifications, hoping to resist stubbornly, but judging by the terrain there, the enemy will definitely not succeed. In the previous few days, the enemy advanced into Luodian town in two routes. The front lines saw a small number of enemy troops advance to the Shi Xiang Gong Temple in Jiading County, but after being encircled and attacked by our rear forces, the enemy was unable to hold and retreated. In terms of the current situation, the enemy in that area can be completely annihilated in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Enemy Remnants at Wenzaobang Plan Stubborn Resistance</h3>
<p>Enemy ships on the river use the power of the rising tide to suppress our army's position with artillery fire.</p>
<p>The fighting between the two sides has been quite fierce in the coastal area in recent days, with incessant artillery fire day and night. The air force has also been deployed to assist in the battle. According to reliable information, there are still more than a thousand enemy troops in the Lianglu Bureau factory and station north of Wenzaobang, along the railway, resisting stubbornly and attempting to penetrate further. However, our side has long deployed heavy troops there, and the enemy is already encircled. However, due to the terrain, the enemy ships anchored on the river surface often take advantage of the rising tide to suppress our positions with artillery fire. Therefore, our side is waiting calmly, awaiting the opportunity to annihilate them in one fell swoop, which will not be difficult.</p>
<p>According to another report, only a few hundred enemy remnants remain in the Zhanghuabang area, scattered widely throughout various places, and will soon be cleared. In the Wenzaobang to Wusong area, enemy corpses are everywhere, piled up like small hills.</p>
<h3>Enemy Plans to Re-attack Nanhui and Chuansha</h3>
<p>Our side is on strict guard, leaving no room for exploitation.</p>
<p>The enemy troops who landed at Nanhui and Chuansha have been completely cleared by us. Yesterday afternoon, it was reported that many enemy ships and merchant ships were spotted on the sea northeast of Nanhui, with wooden planks prepared, seemingly intending to land again. Our side is on strict guard and there is absolutely nothing to worry about.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Launch Repeated Counterattacks in Eastern Shanghai</h3>
<p>They are beaten back and scattered by our army; harassment continues all night without success.</p>
<p>The enemy troops along North Sichuan Road, Jiangwan Road, and Yangshupu Road west of the Gongsida Yarn Factory launched counterattacks against our army's positions along that line last night, taking advantage of the arrival of their reinforcements. Our army also launched a counterattack along the entire line. The enemy troops, seeing that we were prepared, retreated immediately, but soon returned, only to be beaten back again by our army. The harassment continued all night, but was ultimately unsuccessful. At Shanghai University, our army's front lines are only five hundred [units of measurement missing] away from the northern [enemy position]. The two sides are locked in a stalemate.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Cause Disturbance in All Directions This Morning</h3>
<p>Reconnaissance over Nanshi and Pudong</p>
<p>At dawn this morning, enemy aircraft were out causing disturbances in all directions again. The grinding noise reflected the barbaric behavior of the aggressors. They initially flew around the Xuhui area, and then around 9:00 AM, they flew over Pudong and Nanshi for reconnaissance, attempting to bomb.</p>
<p>Also, a report states that at around 7:00 AM today, a squadron of Japanese aircraft flew over Pudong, randomly dropping bombs and strafing downwards with machine guns. A small number of innocent civilians were hit and killed or injured. This inhuman act by enemy aircraft is likely due to their attempts to spy on Pudong failing, and they are therefore venting their anger through this cruel behavior. However, our army has not suffered any damage.</p>
<p>According to intelligence obtained yesterday, enemy aircraft will carry out large-scale bombing of Nanshi, Wusong, and Yangshupu today, but as of noon today, no large-scale bombing by enemy aircraft has occurred. Only three enemy aircraft circled over Nanshi and Pudong for reconnaissance starting at 8:00 AM this morning, and strafed our police maintaining order at the Guanzhao Bridge of the 16th Division with machine guns, leaving after approximately two hours.</p>
<h3>Nissin Warehouse Catches Fire After Being Hit</h3>
<p>Losses Exceed Half After Two Major Fires</p>
<p>The Nissin Company warehouse in Zhangjiabang, Pudong, was hit again by shelling and caught fire at approximately 9:00 AM this morning. The flames were fierce, and thick smoke swept northward across the Huangpu River with the wind. The fire continued to burn until noon and has not been extinguished. The building was stacked with large quantities of flour and grains. After two major fires, more than half of the warehouse and goods have been lost.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Deliberately Bomb Nantong Christian Hospital</h3>
<p>More Than Thirty Teachers and Patients Die; Chongying Girls' School of the American Church is also Bombed</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to reports from Nantong recently received by Director Liu of the Department of Health, the Japanese aircraft bombed the Nantong Christian Hospital established by the American Church. On the morning of August 17, at 9:00 AM, ten Japanese aircraft appeared over Nantong and dropped six bombs on the Nantong Christian Hospital and its surroundings. One bomb went directly into the hospital ward, immediately exploding and catching fire, completely destroying the ward. It is known that Lin, a female doctor, Wang, a trainee doctor, two nurses, four workers, and more than thirty patients died. The number of injured patients and hospital staff is still under investigation. Another bomb fell on the residence of Pastor Pool, completely destroying it. Fortunately, Mr. and Mrs. Pool had left Nantong two days earlier. The third bomb fell on Chongying Girls' School, established by the American Church, completely destroying the school's newly completed gymnasium. The other bombs all fell near the hospital. Two hospital residences have collapsed, and the exact number of damaged houses is not yet clear. The site of the Christian Hospital is located in the suburbs of Nantong. There are no factories, airfields, or other military facilities nearby. The Japanese aircraft's bombing was definitely not due to error, but a deliberate destruction of a charitable organization. There are still two American nurses in the hospital, Ms. Chuan Rui and Ms. Mai Wenke, both of whom were slightly injured. According to recent reports, these two American female nurses are still working on rescue efforts in Nantong. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Pays Attention to Refugee Hygiene</h3>
<p>Vaccination and Establishment of Isolation Hospitals; Dispatching Personnel to Instruct on Necessary Hygiene Methods</p>
<p>According to the investigation by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, there are currently as many as ninety-three refugee shelters within the Settlement. Their sizes vary, and they accommodate over 100,000 refugees. In addition to working with the authorities to find ways to transport refugees out, the Council also believes that the hygiene of these refugees is extremely important. Therefore, it has specifically instructed the Health Department to vaccinate the refugees at each shelter. In recent days, approximately 3,000 people have been vaccinated. The Council is also concerned about refugees suffering from infectious diseases, so it has established an isolation hospital, and the hospital is working to expand daily. Personnel have also been sent to various shelters to instruct on all necessary hygiene methods. In the future, if new shelters are established, the Council will ensure that hygiene is as complete as possible.</p>
<h3>British Public Opinion Extremely Indignant Over the Incident of Japanese Aircraft Shooting the British Ambassador</h3>
<p>US Secretary of State Hull Sends Condolences to Britain; Ambassador Receives Blood Transfusion This Morning with Good Results</p>
<p>Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador, was wounded by Japanese aircraft strafing with machine guns at low altitude at approximately 2:00 PM yesterday on the highway from Nanjing to Shanghai, about fifty miles from Shanghai. His military attaché, Fraser, personally drove the original car at high speed to Shanghai and sent him to Hong'en Hospital, where he was admitted to room 310. Famous doctors Gautenaar and Patton were put in charge of the treatment. As the Ambassador had lost a lot of blood along the way, a blood transfusion was performed immediately that evening. At that time, many British residents and soldiers volunteered to donate. After Dr. Gautenaar's examination and consideration, it was decided that one of the British soldiers who volunteered was the most suitable, and the transfusion was performed immediately for the Ambassador. The procedure went well that evening. According to the examination report at 8:30 AM this morning, the Ambassador had a slightly elevated temperature last night and felt a little uneasy, but he calmed down quickly, so there was no cause for concern. Afterwards, the symptoms were unchanged, the progress was good, and it was very satisfactory. The body temperature and pulse also did not increase, so the Ambassador is now feeling quite comfortable mentally, and there is no need to worry too much about the injury. It was later learned that the attending doctors felt the Ambassador was too deficient in blood, and even after a blood transfusion last night, it was still not enough, so they called another British soldier to continue the blood transfusion this morning. According to news at 1:00 PM this afternoon, the procedure went very well. As for performing surgery to remove the bullet, it will depend on the Ambassador's health in two or three days.</p>
<h3>Our Country's Authorities Shocked and Saddened</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Nanjing, 26th. When the authorities of our country learned that British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was shot and injured by Japanese aircraft near Wuxi, they all expressed shock and regret. After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received an official report from the British Embassy, it immediately ordered Yu Ming, the Director of the Ministry's office in Shanghai, to go to the Hong'en Hospital where the British Ambassador was staying to express condolences on behalf of Chairman Chiang and Minister Wang. Minister Wang also sent a telegram to British Foreign Secretary Eden expressing his condolences. According to the official announcement by the British Embassy, at 2:30 PM this afternoon, the car carrying the British Ambassador, flying the British flag, was bombed by two Japanese aircraft with bombs and machine guns at a location 100 kilometers from Wuxi. The British Ambassador was injured in the stomach and spine.</p>
<h3>Britain to Take Appropriate Measures</h3>
<p>[London] The British Foreign Office has just issued a statement stating that the British government is deeply concerned about the news that British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was strafed and shot by Japanese forces. The British government is currently seeking some details that it requires. Once this information is received, the British government can take appropriate measures toward the Japanese government. According to the report received by the government, the car carrying the British Ambassador was flying the British flag and was attacked by two Japanese aircraft with machine guns and bombs at approximately 2:30 PM. The British Ambassador was seriously injured and is currently in a hospital in Shanghai. British military attaché Lieutenant Colonel Fraser and financial advisor Bage, who were in the same car, are reportedly uninjured. At the same time, although the statement that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai have expressed their apology to the British Acting Consul-General is considered satisfactory by many, the British government had previously notified both China and Japan that China and Japan must be held responsible for any losses suffered by British lives and property due to the war. Even if the bombing of the British Ambassador was accidental, the indiscriminate bombing of civilian vehicles in the absence of a declaration of war is to be condemned. The news of the British Ambassador's injury arrived in London before noon, and those who heard it were greatly shocked. The evening papers did not contain much detail, as the telegrams from China were neither detailed nor consistent. The British public later learned that there was no question of the Japanese deliberately bombing the British Ambassador, but the location of the car was on the highway from Nanjing to Shanghai, no less than fifty miles away from the area where the Chinese and Japanese troops were fighting. Since a state of war between the Chinese and Japanese governments had not been declared, what was the justification for indiscriminately attacking vehicles traveling on the highway? This is extremely puzzling. Judging from the statement, the British government will take action only after investigating the details of the matter. It is heard that the British Ambassador's wife and two daughters are currently vacationing in Beidaihe, and the British officials there have immediately notified them of this unfortunate event. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 27th)</p>
<h3>US Secretary of State Sends Condolences to Britain</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Washington, 26th, Reuters dispatch. US Secretary of State Hull telegraphed the British government today to express his sadness and condolences over the injury of the British Ambassador. Hull called this an extremely regrettable and unfortunate event. Many believe that this incident proves the dangers faced by neutrals in the war zone and may strengthen the argument for all Americans to leave Shanghai. Hull met with President Roosevelt today to discuss recent developments, and the President then attended a cabinet meeting. According to news from cabinet members, the US President only described the current situation in the Far East in detail and has not made any decisions.</p>
<h3>London Public Opinion Extremely Outraged</h3>
<p>Central News Agency London, 26th, Havas dispatch. After British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was wounded by Japanese aircraft using machine guns today, the official authorities have not commented on it, but public opinion in general is extremely indignant. It is widely believed that the British government had previously warned both China and Japan that each country would be directly responsible for any actions that harmed the safety or property of British citizens. Therefore, Japan cannot shirk responsibility for this incident. Political figures say that in legal terms, there is currently no state of war in China. If Japan merely uses the excuse that travel near the war zone is not advisable and bombs cars carrying non-military personnel with aircraft, its crime cannot be excused. Moreover, the area where the Japanese army is fighting is not its own territory, but belongs to China, which maintains diplomatic relations with the Tokyo government. How can the Japanese army act arbitrarily? The general public believes that the actions that the British government should take in the future regarding the injury of Ambassador Hughe should be based, in part, on the above views.</p>
<h3>Japan Uses Poison Gas Against Our Army After Failing in Nankou</h3>
<p>Our Army Still Resisting Firmly</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to a statement by the Supreme Military Authority today, after the Japanese army repeatedly failed to attack Nankou, they released poison gas against the soldiers of the Chinese 89th Division on the 24th and 25th of this month. However, the division is still resisting to the best of its ability. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Britain Considers the Enemy's Blockade of Our Coast Illegal</h3>
<p>US Authorities Will Not Tolerate Interference with US Shipping</p>
<p>[London] The British Foreign Office has not yet received any official notification from Japan regarding the blockade of the South China coast. It is heard that a legitimate state of war definitely does not exist, and Britain has no question of recognizing the blockade, just as the British government has not recognized the blockade of the Spanish coast declared by Spanish Nationalist leader Franco. If Japan does not demand the right to stop and inspect British ships, then Britain will not be affected in any way. So far, Japan has not hinted at any intention to search British ships (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency on the 27th).</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the decision by the Japanese Third Fleet to blockade the southeastern coast of China, the US State Department has refused to comment, believing that the matter has not yet been officially raised with the US government and it is not appropriate to express an opinion hastily. However, sources familiar with the matter believe that if US maritime transportation is interfered with arbitrarily by Japan, it will definitely not be tolerated by President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull. Therefore, if Japan does not formally declare war on China and attempts to blockade the country's coast, it will inevitably put itself in an extremely difficult position. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency on the 27th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Drop Bombs in Fujian and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>[Fuzhou] Three enemy aircraft flew low over the northwest countryside of the province at 4:30 AM this morning, conducting reconnaissance for several weeks, before flying north. Enemy aircraft have been passing through Fuqing for several days, and there have been reports of bombings in Meizhou, Putian. Yesterday, enemy aircraft moored in Matan Ao strafed the Gongzheng, a civilian ship entering the port, injuring a ship steward and a passenger each. All parties are indignant (Special dispatch on the 26th).</p>
<p>[Nanchang] At 2:00 AM on the 26th, enemy aircraft attacked Jiangxi again. The city's air defense agencies reported the attack in advance, and the police and soldiers were mobilized and put on alert. When multiple enemy aircraft flew to Leping, our air force took off to intercept them, and the enemy aircraft scattered in panic. Only three aircraft penetrated into Nanchang's airspace at 2:20 AM, flying very high. After being heavily bombarded by our anti-aircraft guns, they hastily dropped more than a dozen bombs, causing slight damage to houses and residents, before escaping at 3:00 AM. The alert was immediately lifted (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th).</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Four enemy aircraft flew to Anting and Qingyanggang along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway at 7:35 AM on the 26th and dropped bombs, resulting in several station employees being injured and slight damage to the tracks (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th).</p>
<h3>Sichuan and Shaanxi Goods Rerouted for Export</h3>
<p>[Chongqing] Due to the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the export of goods from Sichuan and Shaanxi has been suspended for ten days. Goods transported by Yangtze River steamers to Wuhan will be rerouted through the Guangdong-Hankou Railway for sale in Hong Kong. Exporters have already drafted measures for rerouting goods for export and paying taxes, and have submitted them to the Finance and Special Affairs Department of the Headquarters for review. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Our Army Reaches Dahu Village on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops at Huifeng Bridge Have Been Eliminated; Japanese Troops Loot Shops in Jinghai City; Zhangbei Is Heavily Encircled by Our Army</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Our army is attacking the enemy's rear on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. After the Japanese troops withdrew from Duliu Town, several regiments of our army advanced to Dahu Village, eighteen *li* northeast of Chen Guantun. A major battle is expected tonight. The enemy attacking Huifeng Bridge on the right flank has been eliminated. In Jinghai City, over three hundred enemy troops looted the shops and compiled bandits into the [ranks] and issued ridiculous proclamations. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Zhangbei has been heavily encircled by our army, cutting off the enemy's communication. The enemy is urgently increasing reinforcements from the direction of Dolon, and fierce fighting is expected within days. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The Tianjin airfield is currently flooded, so the Japanese army cannot utilize the thirty aircraft stationed there. Hundreds of Chinese workers are currently pumping water out of the airfield day and night. The Wen'anwa area south of Tianjin has become a swamp, and the workers who made bricks and tiles have all fled. Residents of Jinghai are taking small boats to Tianjin to avoid the bombing by Japanese artillery. It is said that banditry is rampant along the Grand Canal due to the absence of police. Tianjin-Pukou Railway trains currently run as far north as Tangguantun north of Machang (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th).</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Regarding Japan's blockade of our country's coastal ports, regardless of the impact this has on our country or the benefits it has for the enemy, according to international maritime law, in order to implement a blockade, ㊀ there must be a formal declaration of war, and ㊁ all neutral countries must be notified in advance. Although there have been so-called "accidental incidents" between China and Japan, there has been no formal declaration of war, and we have not heard of any notifications to neutral countries. Alas, all the treaties and regulations of international law have been trampled on by Japan.</p>
<p>We were greatly surprised that British Ambassador Dr. Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was ambushed by enemy aircraft on the way from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday and suffered serious injuries. As to whether this is enough to cause unease among the British and what attitude Britain should take towards Japan, I am unwilling to comment on these matters. However, Japan's inhuman behavior has been fully demonstrated to the world, so what else can be said about the killing of Red Cross relief workers?</p>

<p>Every morning, two lepers deliver newspapers in the apartment. The bigger one delivers the small newspapers, and the smaller one delivers the big newspapers. Since the withdrawal of the 29th Army, Beiping has been like a dead city. Aside from counter-propaganda, the theories of the traitors are gradually gaining ground! The newspaper delivery men have more dealings with the newspaper offices, and they know some news that the newspapers dare not publish. Around 7 o'clock, the mine entrance is crowded with people waiting for the newspaper, mostly students or government employees, looking at each other with sighs, gloomy and silent. Therefore, in recent days, the citizens have been saying with one voice: the academic community is the most excited and the most disheartened. Yesterday (August 6th), the daily newspaper carried the news that General Feng Yuxiang would broadcast at 8 PM. This news quickly entered everyone's heart. After dinner, strolling on the street, the first thing acquaintances say when they meet is: "Let's see what Old Feng has to say today. Can such a population in two major cities really be taken away so easily with just a scare?" The storefronts with radios are more bustling than ever since the incident. The police have also temporarily increased! "Old," "young," "male," "female," "shop assistants, bosses," wearing long gowns and short jackets, in groups of three or twos, are talking and discussing. The sidewalks in front of many stores are impassable!</p>
<p>Twenty minutes past 8, the radio is still crackling with strange electrical interference, and there is commotion in the crowd! The sounds of feet being stepped on and scraped follow one another. Disappointment is written on everyone's faces. In the heavy footsteps, people gradually disperse, and the shops return to their former quietness. The police also walk away listlessly. "Damn it, the devils are doing mischief again! Alas! I don't know if the government has any solutions now?" These vague and weary conversations can often be heard in the dispersing crowd.</p>
<p>A group of people surrounded the bigger leper. Yesterday, the bigger leper heard the Nanjing broadcast at the Drum Tower. Feng Yuxiang said: "There is a bumper harvest in North China this year. The mobilization order will be issued after autumn. We will fight to the end, even if we have only one soldier and one soldier left." "Good! Damn, Old Feng is really a man, dares to speak hard words!" This is the apartment's tea room boy's praise after slapping his thigh. The bigger leper's small newspaper is sold out immediately. The smaller leper pushed his bicycle in. "How is it? Does the smaller leper have any news?" Again, people are grabbing newspapers while asking, "The people in the office said: There is military action in Chengde, and Japanese soldiers are heading north every day." Then there is a burst of joyful laughter. "Can't read it! Damn traitor newspaper is spreading rumors!" A pile of newly torn newspapers fell to the ground!</p>
<p>Depression envelops the entire Beiping. It's really a miracle! The transportation lines of Tianjin and Beiping are controlled by Japan, yet they still talk about the final juncture, withdrawing troops from Beiping in order to "sparing the people from suffering." Such good slogans cannot cover up the iron-clad historical evidence. The 1.5 million people became "turtles in a jar" after Song Zheyuan left! Seeking peace from tigers and wolves is increasing the enemy's courage. We should thank the Japanese for their diplomatic considerations. Beiping city is spared from suffering, but the people in the four suburbs are suffering. Immediately after the Tongzhou Security Team revolted, there was a massacre. When will the hatred between nations end! The gunshots of the 29th Army's retreat alarmed the patriotism of the Security Team. Tongzhou was recovered in an instant, but who knew that this great force was sacrificed because there were no reinforcements! The Japanese reinforcements arrived! The Security Team could not defend the city alone. Beiping was attacked by the Japanese from the front and rear, suffering heavy losses. The painstaking efforts of enduring humiliation and bearing shame for several years to deceive the enemy were wasted! How great is this power, and how rare is the opportunity? Tight organization and detailed planning are indispensable at this critical juncture. The survival of the nation is at stake, yet can there be suspicion within our own ranks? The country is in danger! We should rise up, the government officials should quickly correct their past mistakes, and the local authorities should also "think deeply after the pain"! Beiping was sacrificed due to several shortcomings: "self-suspicion," "loose organization," and "incomplete planning"!</p>
<p>The Chinese nation will surely be revived. After the Lugou Bridge Incident, the strong national consciousness and popular sentiment in Beiping, the dedication of the soldiers and the nervousness of the people are the main foundations of the great cause of the Chinese nation's restoration. But this requires the whole country to unite and rise up together! Do not be suspicious! Do not create internal strife! Although we are in a dangerous city, we are not anxious. The people of Beiping are always ready to respond to China's self-defense war tomorrow!</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army in Chahar Province Suddenly Recaptures Taomiao Village</h3>
<p>Advancing towards Chongli and Duolun in separate directions. The Anti-Japanese Army's five routes are gaining momentum. The bandits and puppets' economy is extremely uneasy.</p>
<p>A communication from Zhangjiakou: In recent days, the Japanese army has repeatedly used a small number of airplanes to spy on Zhangjiakou and actively deployed the puppet army in the Hebei-Chahar region, drawing them to the so-called suitable areas. Regular Japanese divisions are also attacking our Nankou in separate directions and preparing to attack our Chahar-Suiyuan area. At this time, when the enemy is deeply invading and the national crisis is serious, a passionate civilian army took the opportunity to recover villages such as Taomiao and Shizuizi. The county seat of Chongli is also showing signs of being recaptured. The battle situation on each route and the process of recovering Taomiao, as well as the internal situation of the civilian army, are described below.</p>
<p>Taomiao Village in Chongli County, Chahar Province, which has been occupied for years, was suddenly recaptured at 2:00 AM on the 11th of this month by righteous people Qiao Jianzhong, Yang Zhensheng, Zhang Jinsheng, Cao Fatong, and Bu Ziqian of the People's Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Brigade. At that time, they had a fierce battle with the puppet Mongolian Security Team stationed in the village for an hour, killing Imaeda Uichiro, the Japanese instructor of the puppet supervision office, on the spot, and capturing one puppet Mongolian Security Team member, more than ten horses, and more than eighty rifles. Because Ma Zilong, the puppet police chief of Taomiao, and patrol officer Ao Yupu had previously contacted the civilian army to defect and vowed to serve the country, the local order was temporarily maintained by Shan Ma and others. On the 12th, villages near Taomiao such as Shizuizi and Yimatutu were also recaptured one after another, and banners of the Blue Sky and White Sun were hung everywhere. Our Chahar army has formally dispatched troops to garrison the area. The righteous people Qiao Jianzhong and others have advanced towards the Xiwanzhi area of Chongli County, and there are signs that they will also capture it. Most of the civilian army and righteous people have now reached Maniba, ninety miles north of Zhangbei County, and are advancing as the opportunity arises.</p>
<p>In the past, the civilian army in Chahar Province was engaged in secret work, and the number and organization were not very detailed. Now, what is known is that there is a People's Anti-Japanese Army Guerrilla, with a total of four teams including Zhang Zhongying and others. Now there is also a righteous people's force that is the main force in recapturing Taomiao Village. Their team number is the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, with Qiao Jianzhong as the commander-in-chief, divided into five routes. Cao Fatong is the commander of the first route, Zhang Jinsheng is the commander of the second route, Yang Zhensheng is the commander of the third route, Han Xixian is the commander of the fourth route, and Lou Guanjun is the commander of the fifth route. As for the strength of their subordinates, because they are scattered in various places, it is currently unknown. However, there are more than 500 people in Heihe Town, which belongs to Chicheng County. Han Xixian led the troops and originally planned to take Chongli with Qiao Jianzhong. Now, because Qiao's troops have sufficient strength to recover the city and have a surplus, they have changed their route to Duolun, aiming to cut off the puppet army's retreat and give them a great blow. Lou Guanjun, the commander of the fifth route, has been in the military for a long time and has experienced many battles, and has a great understanding and experience of warfare. Currently, there are more than 100 cadres in the team lurking in a certain place in Kangbao County, planning to take advantage of the opportunity to recover Kangbao. As for the other routes, they are also secretly working in separate directions, and the situation is becoming more and more active. The Japanese and puppet troops are strategically hit hard.</p>
<p>After the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army recovered Taomiao, the whole village hung flags to celebrate, and Cao Fatong, in the name of the commander of the first route, issued a proclamation to reassure the people. The original text said, "It has been more than a year since our Chahar counties were invaded and occupied by the violent Japanese, and the people are in a deep abyss. They are only fish on the chopping board, and their ambition is still to gain an inch and push forward step by step. Recently, they have used force to disturb our Tianjin and Beiping, killing and slaughtering villagers. All kinds of vicious methods have been recognized by the world. Our Chinese nation has always advocated peace. In this situation of unbearable endurance, the people of various places have formed national salvation armies to save our nation from eternal catastrophe. Now, this commander leads hundreds of brave soldiers to drive away the bandit army stationed in the Chongli Taomiao area on the 10th of this month, and shot and killed the instructor Imaeda Uichiro, who was hated by the people, to vent their anger. Our various routes are attacking the other counties, and it will not be difficult to recover them in a short time. However, the Manchurian banknotes and copper coins issued by the puppet Manchukuo will be prohibited from general use from today. Our army is originally a people's force. Wherever we go, we treat the local elders and folks as our hometown. We will never take anything from the people. We hope that all merchants and people will open their businesses as usual and not panic. Those who are lawless and spread rumors will be severely punished without leniency. This is the announcement."</p>
<p>Also, a certain unit of our side has been advancing towards Shangdu from the area of Damiaozi and Tumuerte, and it is said that the Northwest Reclamation Team in Shangdu County has been recovered by us. Other units on our side are also actively preparing for battle. As for the news of the puppet army in Chahar Province, it is said that the personnel of the puppet agencies in Huade are currently extremely panicked and are preparing to move to Kangbao County, with Duolun as their rear and the hub for the connection and transportation of the Rehe and Chahar regions. At the same time, there are rumors that Prince De has left Huade and his whereabouts are unknown. Li Shou-hsin did arrive at Daqinggou (i.e. Shangyi) on the 10th of this month and planned to stay there for a long time in order to facilitate the command of the puppet army. The soldiers of the puppet Sixth Division of Bao Yin-ul-dzhi stationed in Guyuan often carry weapons and flee, and the military morale is extremely scattered. On the other hand, the people are deeply resentful because they have been trampled on by the Japanese and puppets for a long time. Now, when they hear about the recovery of Taomiao Village, they cannot help but be excited and eagerly hope that the army will come and rescue them from their predicament. In Zhangbei, Japanese troops have set up artillery positions everywhere in the Bolicai and Huanghuaping areas under the county's jurisdiction in order to defend them, and the enemy's morale has been weakened. It can be seen that the Japanese and puppet troops in Zhangbei city leave the city every night and scatter in the suburbs, and then re-enter the city after dawn. Also, more than 100 cavalrymen of the puppet Mongolian Security Team arrived north of Gaojiayingzi at 12:00 noon on the 14th.</p>
<p>Since the six counties of Chahar Province were forcibly carved out by the Japanese army sheltering bandits and puppets, the source of the bandits and puppets' military and political expenses is partly provided by the Japanese Kwantung Army and partly from imposing exorbitant taxes and levies on the people. Moreover, since the Battle of Honggeertu last year, the military and political center of the area, Bailingmiao (formerly known as Baihanmiao), has been successively recovered by us, giving the Japanese and puppet military, political, and economic systems a great blow. On the people's side, the heavy burden of paying taxes and serving in the military has long been exhausted, resulting in a bleak atmosphere in all industries in the market. Moreover, most of the paper money circulating in the market is the counterfeit "Manchuria" Central Bank paper money, which is equivalent to ghost money. Because merchants trade and move, the legal tender of the Central, China, Jiaotong, and Chahar Provincial Banks of our mainland has flowed into Chahar in large numbers. The general public, because of their faith in the motherland, regard the above-mentioned legal tender of our banks as treasures and are reluctant to use them easily. Now that the situation is chaotic, the general public is even more distrustful of counterfeit money, resulting in an extremely panic-stricken economic situation in various counties of Chahar. In order to maintain the economy, the Japanese and puppets have instigated the gentry of Zhangbei to come forward and jointly seek remedial measures.</p>
<h3>A Respectful Message to Young People and the Masses Everywhere</h3>
<p>Yesterday a friend told me, "There are countless young people, countless masses, who want to contribute their abilities to the country, but they are suffering from having no way." This is indeed a very important question.</p>
<p>I thought about it carefully, and they probably want to do two things. One is to join the army and fight the enemy desperately, so that there will be one less enemy for every one they kill. The other is to offer their services to the government, hoping that my opinions will be adopted or that there will be some assistance. Of course, it is a passionate heart, but I am afraid that it is useless. Modern warfare is not a matter of risking one's life. The higher ones must have military knowledge, and the lower ones must also have formal training. If ordinary people are mixed in, it will not only be useless but also harmful. As for the political reality, we are completely ignorant. Even if you have a very high political knowledge and write a long letter, it may not be pertinent. It will only make the government people busy and talk to us, looking at our petitions and wasting useful time. This is also harmful and useless. If that's the case, where should the passion of our people be poured? Don't worry, listen to me. This war is probably a major war in the East. The enemy's Prime Minister has already declared that he is prepared for a long-term war. We should naturally prepare for a long-term response. Responding to the war does not only depend on the front line, nor does it only depend on the central government, nor does it only depend on the governments of the provinces. It still depends on the people in the hinterland. I hope that the young people and the masses everywhere will not leave their hometowns. Those who are not in their hometowns will find it difficult to make a living in commercial ports. It is better to go back as soon as possible and unite to do things that you can do in your local area.</p>
<p>The first is to maintain order. This is originally the responsibility of the government, but it is especially effective when local people come out to help. In this time of great disaster, there are no classes, no factions. Even if there are some opinions on weekdays, they should be crossed out with one stroke. Everyone has only one heart, which is to save the country and survive. Among them, there are several very important things: (A) Stabilize people's hearts. These days, I have heard people in the interior say that in places where enemy planes have passed, they have occasionally dropped a few bombs, and people's hearts are very panic-stricken. People living in the city are moving to the countryside one after another. In fact, the number of people who are killed or injured is very small. Fleeing may not necessarily lead to death, and not fleeing may not necessarily lead to life. Everyone should not panic. If there is no trouble in the local area, then everything can be started. (B) Eliminate bandits. This requires the power of the military police to gather them in a certain place and force them to work. (C) Intensify training. The existing citizen training should continue to be promoted. Those who are close to the war can help with rear work. Those who are far away can also prepare for the government's micro-adjustment. (D) Supervise education. The seeds of the future citizens are all in children. No matter how difficult it is, education cannot be stopped. All educated young people who cannot enter schools should take on the task of educating the younger generation. However, in this extraordinary period, I advocate that the weekly rest and summer and winter vacations should be abolished.</p>
<p>The second is mass production. Countless compatriots are fighting the enemy on the front line, and the national production capacity has been greatly reduced. The two words "clothing and food" are likely to become difficult. In recent years, a part of the food and cloth has relied on foreign imports. In the future, I am afraid that there will be no money to buy them. Those of us in the rear must not only provide for ourselves, but also provide for our compatriots on the front line. There is no other way but to work twice as hard, cultivate our own land, and weave our own cloth. Men who have never worked in the fields must also help with farming. The women of wealthy families should not just sit idle at home, but quickly get up and spin hemp and weave cloth. In the blink of an eye, the weather will be cold, and winter clothes for those on the front line should also be prepared as soon as possible. As for everyday items for household use, we have long been accustomed to using foreign goods. In the future, we must correct our mistakes. We should use as much of our handicrafts as possible. If they are rougher and less practical, we have to make do with them. We must also save a lot to supply the front line. Tao Kan of the Jin Dynasty usually collected a lot of bamboo heads and wood chips, which later proved to be very useful in the war. These days, the items sought by the Anti-Japanese Support Association, such as sacks, hemp ropes, bamboo and wooden carrying poles, etc., can be supplied in large quantities in the interior. In addition, there are many other things, some of which can be imitated or replaced. If we can prepare them for them, it will also be of great help to the soldiers.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, there are endless things we need to do now. As long as we are willing to contribute our abilities, how can we say there is no way? All the past is like yesterday's death, and all the future is like today's birth. Brisk up your spirits and work hard. There is no need to utter empty curses at the other party, nor is there any need to run aimlessly at the crossroads.</p>
<h3>The Xin Yong'an Steamer Reopened to Suzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, one Xin Yong'an steamer was still on the Shanghai-Suzhou inland river line. It set sail from Tianhougong Bridge on the North Suzhou River, towing a tugboat and carrying about 300 passengers. There were no boats to Xishi yesterday. Because the Jinghu Railway has added passenger trains, the number of passengers on the inland river has decreased compared to the previous few days. In addition, the Shanghai-Hangzhou line has previously arranged for ships by the Huzhou Community Committee to transfer refugee compatriots back to their hometowns. Now, because most of them have been transferred, the relocation matters will be handled jointly by the Municipal Relief Association from now on.</p>
<h3>Liu Manqing and Others Missing</h3>
<p>Feared to have died in the Great World tragedy</p>
<p>Ms. Liu Youxiang of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is the only expert in our country who is familiar with the situation in Kangzang. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in Shanghai, Ms. Liu came to Shanghai from Beijing with Cao Ruizhi, a representative of the people of Xikang, to organize the Youth Kangzang Anti-Japanese Support Committee, staying at Room 430 of the Nanjing Hotel, and running around to contact various parties for anti-Japanese support. However, after the 14th of this month, Liu and Cao both went missing at the same time. Their relatives and friends have been searching for more than a day, but there is still no news. According to the time when Ms. Liu went missing, it coincided with the day when the Great World bombing tragedy occurred. Therefore, most of her relatives and friends deeply believe that Liu has died, but the body is still unable to be found. Currently, Ms. Liu still has many suitcases and luggage in the Nanjing Hotel. Nanjing has also tried to inquire in various directions, but there are still no results. According to Ms. Liu, she is the only outstanding researcher of the Kangzang problem in our country and can speak extremely fluent Kangzang language. She has twice represented the government to Kangzang to promote the central government's intentions and has written two books, "Kangzang Zhi Zheng" and "Border Education." It is a pity that she sacrificed her life for the national crisis this time.</p>
<h3>The Telephone Company Will Restore Telephone Service in the Hongkou District</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Telephone Company had to temporarily close the company due to the tense war and the interruption of power supply, and all service personnel were also temporarily evacuated. Starting yesterday (26th), the original personnel of the branch office have been working as usual, planning to restore the telephone service in the area immediately. However, a severe fire occurred in the district, and the branch office was right in the middle of it. Fortunately, the fire brigade rescued it effectively, so the loss was minimal. According to the engineer of the company, the underground and aerial line projects were severely damaged, and it will take a week to repair them and restore the call.</p>
<h3>The Director General of the Public Works Department Sends a Letter of Thanks to Prison Staff</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the Public Works Department's prison has been located in the war zone, and it is extremely dangerous. The prison staff still tried their best to maintain their duties. The Director General of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession sent a letter to Major Paun, the Acting Director of the Police Department, expressing his admiration, saying, "In this autumn of tense war, all the staff of the Bureau's prison have done their best and achieved remarkable results. Please ask you to convey my admiration to the Acting Superintendent of Prison Affairs and all the staff. The Bureau deeply sympathizes with the situation of the staff and has decided to do its best to improve the current situation of the members." The following is omitted.</p>
<h3>Brief Report on Rear Area Work</h3>
<p>Relief</p>
<p>The war in Pudong has been going on for several days. According to a refugee who escaped from the area, there are no rear area organizations at all. Furthermore, petty thieves abound, taking the opportunity to rob and plunder. The price of boats and carts is ten times higher than usual. Innocent people are not only dying from artillery fire, but also from hunger during their escape. It is deeply hoped that all sectors of Pudong will quickly find ways to organize relief efforts to reduce the suffering of their fellow villagers.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee provided the following brief report on its work yesterday: ㊀ The Reception Group, after investigation, found that the administrator of the 13th Reception Center at Qingliang Temple was managing affairs poorly and ordered the center to be closed. All refugees were transferred to other reception centers. ㊁ The Repatriation Group sent 5,117 refugees by train and ship to Suzhou and Hangzhou. ㊂ The Medical Group treated 350 refugees with minor illnesses and 58 refugees with serious illnesses. ㊃ The Security Group sent personnel to work with the Repatriation Group to impound the Xin Ying Steamer for transporting refugees. ㊄ The Burial Group buried 31 corpses, bringing the total number of burials to 821. ㊅ The Secretariat sent a letter to Fuyuan Qianzhuang requesting them to take over the Hangzhou Restaurant Refugee Hospital and dispatched personnel to negotiate the details. They also sent a letter to the Director of the Bureau of Navigation, ordering that all ships be retained for repatriating refugees and not be used for commercial operations.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society's Relief Teams One and Two, led by Team Leaders Shan Hu and Shi, departed at 3:00 AM yesterday in four groups. They went to Liuying Bridge, Henan Guild Hall, Lianyi Villa, Zhenru, and other places, rescuing 12 wounded soldiers and 1 wounded civilian. They were sent to the First and Third Hospitals run by the society for treatment. It was also reported that the society sent over 150 refugees from various reception centers to the Old Garbage Bridge this morning to board two civilian boats to Wuxi, Jiangyin, and other places. Including the refugees sent yesterday, the total number of refugees transported was over 600.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Benevolent Children's Association recently dispatched Doctors Yu Xisheng and Song Jiaxiang, along with several nurses, to visit various refugee reception centers to assist in the work of rescuing children. If any refugee reception center wishes to conduct children's education work, they can also send a letter to the association requesting the dispatch of child education experts to assist in the operation.</p>
<p>The chairmen of the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, in view of the hardships of their fellow villagers seeking refuge, held a meeting yesterday at the temporary office on Guangxi Road to discuss setting up a reception center. The location is at Qingliang Temple. They are currently sending personnel to negotiate with the temple. Once the negotiations are completed, the center will be opened immediately.</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Mutual Aid Association held a joint meeting of all departments at the association's location on Malan Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. The resolutions were: ㊀ The First Reception Center will be temporarily merged with the Second Reception Center. ㊁ The Nursing Class will continue to be held. ㊂ Comfort wounded soldiers. ㊃ In addition to sending the shoes collected by the association to the front lines, continue to solicit and make shoes. ㊄ Regarding the service issues after the graduation of nursing students, it was resolved to request the Shanghai branch of the Women's Comfort Society to negotiate with the Red Cross Society to dispatch them for service. ㊅ The association will set up a library and reading room.</p>
<p>Since organizing a rescue team, the Buddhist monks in the city have been departing daily to the Bazhi Bridge and Jiangwan area to rescue wounded soldiers and civilians. The total number of wounded soldiers rescued daily is five to six hundred. Now that the center of the war has shifted to the Wusong area, the team has established contact with the military. Starting today, it will send the First and Second Sub-teams to rescue the wounded. It is reported that over 160 monks are participating in this operation.</p>
<p>The Jiangyin Wuxi Fellow Villagers Joint Relief Association yesterday (the 26th) had the Fu Shuichang Steamer tow 13 civilian boats, carrying the eighth batch of 2,200 refugees. Wu Jiannan and Xue Xiren led the team back to Wuxi. The association has successively repatriated nearly ten thousand people. The reception centers are located at 474 Zhejiang Road, 444 Zhejiang Road, 484 Zhejiang Road, 225 Fujian Road, and 1051 Jing'an Temple Road. They are still continuing to receive and repatriate refugees.</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has been actively repatriating fellow villagers to their hometowns in recent days. Because there are very few Shanghai-Ningbo steamships and there is no fixed schedule, the issuance of ship tickets will be suspended starting today. As for the over 7,000 ship tickets that have already been issued, ticket holders can go to the Jinliyuan Wharf every day to wait for the departure of the ships. The association is currently planning other routes back to their hometowns to allow fellow villagers to return home as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Zhu Fengwei, Chairman of the Haiyan Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai, sent over 200 refugee fellow villagers from the county a few days ago and sent another hundred or so back to their hometowns today.</p>
<p>Service</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Sector Wartime Service Group Comfort Department has been慰問慰問 various wounded soldier hospitals for several days. Recently, they are preparing to prepare many comfort bags to distribute to the wounded soldiers. The group has also decided to select the most destitute among the refugees and distribute approximately 500 pieces of old clothes that have been collected in recent days. As for the students who have been affected by the disaster, those who have no home to return to and are in very difficult circumstances will be appropriately accommodated.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Road Construction Association has made some changes to its work in this Shanghai anti-Japanese war compared to peacetime: ㊀ The highway relief service vehicle departs to participate in the Anti-Enemy Support Association to provide relief to damaged or endangered vehicles. ㊁ All staff of the Lichang Automobile Repair Factory, which it sponsors, are always ready to repair ambulance vehicles. ㊂ All staff of the association manage a refugee reception center run by the Joint Disaster Relief Association, which houses over 1,800 people. Therefore, the association's work is exceptionally busy.</p>
<p>The Workers' Wartime Service Group organized by the Shanghai Industrial Sector National Salvation Association, in addition to the first batch departing to the front lines to participate in work and the second batch going to a certain place to undergo training, the third batch of approximately one hundred people will gather at a certain place this morning at 9:00 AM to be divided into teams and depart to participate in the service.</p>
