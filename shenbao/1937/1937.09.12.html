<h3>戰爭期問日本的運輸與燃料</h3>
<p>— 一臧</p>
<p>日本全國產業界因我國的全面抗戰所引起的恐慌、不消說是很大的。現在單就與軍事最有關係的運輸與燃料兩方面的情形，約略來說明一番。</p>
<p>㊀運輸　日本海運界，自蘆溝橋戰事發坐，立即受到嚴重的影響。遞信省首先頒布了外國船隻及關東州船隻的沿岸航路特許制，同時實施統制租船市場等應急對策，開放沿岸航路，變更分配船隻。然而實際上要使近海船隻的數量，適應需要，非常困難。因爲遞信省雖會同商工省斟酌運輸貨品　分輕重緩急，傾注全力，調劑船舶。但是各業反對甚烈，而海運自治聯盟又不能奉令協力，大部分船舶，因有被徵發沒收的危險性，變更船籍與輸送方向，而到暹羅反其他安全地帶去·這種逃避行爲政府是無法防制的。最近因爲戰事擴大的緣故，海運業內恐慌愈益顯得深刻了。</p>
<p>㊁燃料　華北事變發生後的第二日，我國的開平煤礦，中興煤礦所出的煤，完全杜絶輸日，敵國需煤的數量，本年度達四千五百萬噸，大部分本仰給於我國，近來“煤荒”遍及全國，重輕工業化學工業，以及電氣鐵道航運等各方面，都受重大影響·因爲日本第一實庫筑豎煤田，已經開採殆盡。其他國內礦山中，每年出煤二十萬噸以上的煤山，不過數十處，開採煤礦又缺乏熟練礦夫，每年所出之煤不及一千萬噸，而所需要的數量則達四千五百萬噸。平均每月缺煤三百五十噸，因此自七月起，各種事業，都節省緊縮。其他朝鮮台灣各地，煤礦也極缺乏，至就撫順煤礦而言，每年不過出八百三十萬噸，可供給日本國內的，不到二百萬噸。所以從蘆溝橋戰事發生，至今不到二個月，全國大鬧“煤荒”，所謂“燃料飢謹”在生產方向，成爲致命的打擊了。</p>
<p>日本煤價因供給不足，日見騰貴，聞六月底每噸不過三十元，上月每噸忽增加四十餘元。因此消費的工業中心地大阪地方，各產業資本家，受煤價的重壓，都减退生産力，倘若再過三個月，不但重輕工業，勢將停頓，其他交通業與開華的軍艦運輸船的燃料，也要發生重大問題了。</p>
<h3>港英籍船員罷工反對以軍用品運日</h3>
<p>聲明甯願下獄不願服務</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>怎樣推進有利的國際形勢</h3>
<p>— 紀</p>
<p>目前的國際輿論是極端同情我們的。而整個國際形勢也是極有利於我們的。這是一個確定不移的事實。連敵人也不得不承認而表示焦急了。最近敵人擬派權威的代表。往歐美各國去遊說。是很明顯的一例。</p>
<p>這種極端有利於我們的國際形勢的造成。一半是由於我們展開全面對日抗戰的結果。正如倫敦泰晤士報外交記者所說。“中國今旣起而與日本週旋。則其國際間之地位。已升到若干年來所未達到的高度。”我們有一分抵抗的力量。有一分抵抗的决心。國際間對我們的與好感。自必增高一分。這是運用現代外交關係的基本原則。毫無足怪的。可是另外的一半。却是日本帝國主義殘暴行為所造成的。舉例來説。如英大使許閣森氏的横遭日飛機掃射。是日本軍隊任意屠殺中國民衆的最好事實的宣傳。在數小時以内。這一宣傳的力量。已普遍於世界的各處了。又如美旗艦奧葛斯脱號的被日軍轟炸。日當局於上月二十五日及本月五日先後宣怖封鎖中國海岸。任意截留第三國商輪。這又是日本妨害第三國在遠東經濟勞力的最有力的證明。日本這種蠻橫的行動。事實上就是對太平洋上其他有利害關係的國家宣戰。</p>
<p>因為這兩種情勢演進的結果。國際間對我們的援助。已由輿論的而進展到行動的。美國羣衆舉行示威遊行。派糾察隊包圍日本駐美大使館與紐約領事館。以及美海員工人六萬八千名主張美國對日實行經濟封鎖。直到全部日軍退出中國而後止。便是行動的援助的一端。最近美經濟界及輿論界並已討論到英美聯合對日實行經濟制裁的問題。認為英美對日施行經濟制裁。其收效較國聯對意施行經濟制裁為速。如一旦英美聯合對日施行經濟封鎖。則在四個月以內。可以使日本的經濟。受到致命的打擊。</p>
<p>目前國際形勢。旣已對我們極端有利。可是怎樣去推進去運用這種國際對我們的援助力量。問題還在於我們自已。</p>
<p>我們以為推進目前有利於我們的國際形勢的積極工作。主要的應該有二端。</p>
<p>第一。我們應該堅决的把持久抗戰的决心昭示全世界。明白的說。敵人旣已封鎖我全部海岸了。我們唯一所希望的“不宣戰則不致封鎖我海岸”的幻想。已成泡影。而第三國之施行中立法與否。已不成為值得我們攷慮的問題。所以我們應該立卽召回駐日大使及領事。對日斷絕國交。取消日本在華一切特殊權利。停付日本所有債款的本息。沒收日本在華的一切公私財產。以示澈底抗戰的决心。</p>
<p>第二。我們應該與蘇俄進一步作運用國際外交上的聯繫在軍事上我們雖不必急急使不侵犯條約立卽演進爲互助公約但是在外交上。我們不妨與蘇俄取一致性的步驟使國聯這一座和平殿堂的實際功效能夠在太平洋中表現出來幾句話、就是加緊地完成太平洋集體安全制度這一機構。以集體的行動。來制裁日本的侵略。其實。實現這一機構的可能性。是很大的。問題是在我們運用的適當與否。</p>
<p>我們不必怕日意所謂防共協定或者甚至於日德意三角同盟協定的成立只要我們不妨害德意在遠東利益的發展我們以為德意是可能保持中立的。</p>
<p>政略戰爭的運用。是我們對日作戰時的極重要的一環。全國上下應一致急起直追的。</p>
<h3>地中海會議安全保障原則商妥</h3>
<p>劃分區域監視計劃　引起重大政治困難</p>
<p>⊙瑞士尼翁鎮　地中海會議本日午後四時十分在本鎭市政廳開幕、會議室中置馬蹄形桌、英·法·保加利亞·埃及·希臘·羅馬尼亞·土耳其·蘇聯·南斯拉夫·九國代表環桌而坐、又阿爾巴尼亞政府迄未提出答復、故仍虛席以待、至德意兩國則已拒不參加、故未為各該國代表保留座位、大會開幕後、當卽舉行公開會議、先由尼翁鎮鎭長舒拉尼致歡迎辭、嗣卽一致通過英國艾登外相之提議選舉法外長台爾博斯為主席、大會旋於台爾博斯·蘇聯外委李維諾夫·與艾登外相相繼發表演說，辭見另電）之後、至午後五時三十分宣告休會、當卽組成技術常設委員會、繼續討論至晚間八時始止，並定於明日午後四時賡續開會、（中央社十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙尼翁鎭　地中海會議負責人士頃宣稱、英法兩國所提出之建議案、乃以在地中海上劃出安全區域、禁止潛水艇航行、並由各國軍艦擔任監視一項辦法為某礎、各國代表討論結果、聞已在原則上成立妥協、某某數國代表雖曾要求對於實施方法、補充加以說明、但預料明日午後四時可望正式通過、俾於本月二十日之前付諸實施、按之此項建議、各國商船此後必須經由指定的航線、各國軍艦始可加以保護、並於遭遇潛水艇襲擊時予以援助、關於制止飛機或軍艦（潛水艇除外）襲擊問題、則當於上項建議案通過之後、賡續加以討論、其應付辦法、大抵為派遣航空母艦巡弋地中海上、俾遇飛機襲擊各國商船時、由各該航空母艦派出飛機予以追擊、此外關於英國提議將地中海劃分爲東西兩部一層、西部原應由英法兩國艦隊擔任監視、茲聞英法兩國當邀請意國與之合作、但意國若果加以拒絕、英法兩國仍當單獨予以維持、至東部海面、當由蘇聯·希臘·土耳其三國艦隊擔任監視、而保加利亞·羅馬尼亞則並不參加云、（中央社十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙尼翁鎭　頃據哈瓦斯社訪員探悉、日昨地中海會議開幕之後、英法兩國提議、由關係各國海軍分區監視地中海航道、以免遭受潛水艇攻擊、而蘇聯海軍亦得參加監視、此項辦法現已引起得大之政治困難、參加會議之若干國家觀察者、對於蘇聯參加海軍監視一層、已立卽提出異議、以爲去年關於土耳其韃靼納爾海峽之蒙德婁公約訂立以後、意國迄未簽字加入、今若令蘇聯參加地中海海軍監視、則在意國將視為與該國故意為難、意國從此更不能參加蒙德婁公約矣、此外各國如土耳其等、對於英法兩國所主持之地中海互助制一旦復活、雖表示歡迎、但土耳其等在地中海東區與蘇聯海軍合作、而英法兩國艦隊、則又在西區共同行動、此其用意、有類於參加思想鬥爭、故不免引以爲慮、對於此種難關、現有兩項解决辦法、正在考慮中、一則規定蘇聯監視區域、僅以黑海為限、或將地中海區域加以擴大、而將黑海包含在內、二則在原則上承認蘇聯有權參加海軍監視、但勸令蘇聯、以該國海軍艦隊不敷調遣爲辭、放棄此項監視權、聞英國贊成第二項辦法、惟蘇聯能否接受、則殊未敢必耳、（中央社十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>⊙尼翁鎭　英外相艾登·法外長台爾博斯、今晨舉行會商、歷時甚久、當將英法兩國所提出之地中海海軍監視計虹、作最後之確定、嗣後兩人即與蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫有所會商、又本日午刻、台爾博斯宴請出席地中海會議九國代表之際、亦曾作預備談話、聞各國代表曾考慮將英法兩國所提出之原案酌加修改如下、㊀意國倘接受參加監視、則當以第勒尼安海（在意國之南）委託意大利担任監視、㊁蘇聯專門担任黑海方面之海軍監視、而以地中海之大部分委託英法兩國加以監視、尤其是西地中海西班牙海面之危險地帶、完全由英法海軍担任監視、英法兩國現希望此事呆於今晚成立妥洽、而於下星期一日通過全部計劃、若然、則該計劃當可立即見諸實施、則以英法兩國政府已凖備立即增加駐地中海艦隊故也、（中央社十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法俄英代表發表演說</h3>
<p>維護國際公法　指斥海盜行為</p>

<p>蘇俄外交委員李維諾夫繼起發言、略稱、地中海會議在此際召集、殊爲適合時宜、蓋不但蘇聯船舶曾受海盜行爲之害、即裏海沿岸與外方交通、亦均以地中海為唯一孔道也、蘇聯對於國際秩序與和平、極願加以維護、而對於各種侵略行爲與違反國際條約之所爲、則亟欲加以以對、某某數國今茲拒絕參加地中海會議、査各該國雖均置有大隊商船、而獨不畏海盜行爲、揆其原因不外兩端、即㊀海盜行爲、即係各該國所主持、㊁各該國與海盜有密切之關係、並互相諒解是也、此外西班牙共和政府並未邊其參加會議、殊可扼腕彼海盜行為目的何在、與負責者之為何國、吾人莫不了然、特該國之名、當僅由受害各國在會議中予以道破耳、至外傳蘇聯船舶兩艘、係該國艦艇自行擊沉之說、荒謬之極、不值一笑、則以該船舶係被飛機炸沉故也、蘇聯現當自行採取各項措置、以爲保護本國船舶之計、特各國倘能採取有效的集體措置、則蘇聯亦準備參加其間云、</p>

<h3>血戰兩晝夜楊行敵軍遭我痛擊</h3>
<p>我極佔優勢頑敵旦夕可擊潰　虬江碼頭我仍固守軍工路綫　羅店月浦敵軍反攻均不得逞</p>
<p>（本報特訊）敵軍自前昨兩日從寶楊路進犯楊行、砲火猛烈異常、並有飛機多架助戰、企圖打通至羅店之綫、當經我軍猛力抵抗、奮勇肉搏、敵軍由丁公廟木橋宅以坦克東爲前導、在飛機砲火掩護之下、昨夜突破楊行鎭我軍防綫、我後方精銳部隊、立卽開至前綫猛力反攻、自夜至晨、砲火不絕、計血戰兩晝夜、爲敵軍侵滬一月以來最激烈之戰爭、敵軍立足未穩、卽遭我軍之痛擊、死傷甚重、至記者屬稿時止、我軍極佔優勢、進抵鎭東兪家浜一帶、又敵軍另一路向月浦進犯、我軍嚴陣以待、敵軍計不得逞、但自月浦至楊行之間、大隊敵機、大施轟炸、到處投擲燒夷彈、兪宅浜至楊行鎭以東一帶村落、着火燃燒、盡成焦土、</p>

<p>日近衛首相。前日會見日本新聞記者。記者臄舉數點。探詢意見。如怎樣今後處理時局方針。怎樣順應戰事內閣政策。怎樣確定明年預算方針。等等。這種問題。都是最急耍而亦最爲日本國民應周知的問題。但是近衛總括一個答案。便是戰。謂如戰之外。無考慮問題。這未免太覺鹵莽。而亦太覺不顧一切了。個人辦理一事。尙須預定計劃。考慮步驟。豈有一國之大。僅以一戰字能解决一切乎。我想萬無是理。日本視我國。本如甕中魚。囊中物。不料此次遇到我國勇敢抵抗持久抵抗。眞如吞了一炸彈。宜乎其手忙脚亂。無法擺布也。</p>
<h3>黷武國家窮於應付</h3>
<p>陸軍學校變更敎程　空軍充實亦在進行</p>
<p>中央社云、日軍閥爲企圖行其征服中國實現大陸政策之迷夢、不惜窮兵黷武、傾國來犯、其國內已陷於戰時之恐怖狀態、自蘆溝橋專件發生以來、尤以上海戰事爆發以後、陸軍動員在二十萬人以上、而突遭我勁强之抗戰、所受損傷奇重、不斷請援、陸軍省當局已有窮於應付之感、乃决定將陸軍學校之敎程、加以變更、已於本月二日以第四百七十號敕令公佈、其改正各學校之修業期間、係自七年八個月縮短至六年一個月、以加速戰時體制將校養成、聞此項特例、在日俄戰爭時曾經實施、現重行實施、足見今次戰爭之重要性、又日空軍之充實、亦在進行　係就各科優修將校轉科訓練、並擴大特別志願將校之採用範圍、至於最近日特別議會通過之第三次增加對華臨時軍費二十億零二千二百萬元　陸軍省十四億二千二百萬元、海軍省爲三億四千九百萬元、共餘二億五千萬元爲預備費、</p>

<h3>沈痛的回憶　（一）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>從平津淪陷，一直到記者逃到南京，這其間，差不多有一個月的樣子。看到的，想到的，聽到的，以至親身經歷的種種，每一回憶起來，每一感念起來，在我的心裹，就會生出種種莫名的感覺。——不懂是難受，不懂是哀傷，不懂是悽凉，不懂是悲壯，……總之，絕不是單純的感覺。然而，在這種種回憶和感觸裹，我却明顯地看到了血痕和淚影。現在，我是坐在上海租界上一間高樓裹。三分鐘前，就在我這間房子前面的大街上，忽然飛下了流彈，那熙攘的人羣，立刻倉惶地逃散，祗剩下一條空廓𨶑嚴的大街。頭頂上，有不知來踪去跡的流彈之類，時不時，在空氣裹劃出了一聲長嘯。遠的地方，不斷地，有一轟的一聲，又轟的一聲，在震撼着大地。——那悶重一點的，大概是炸彈，那使遠近響着回聲的，大概是重砲。</p>
<p>這樣的心緒，這樣的環境，要想寫出有系統的東西，那的確是不可能的。但為了使讀者們知道一些平津方面的惰况起見，我祇有熬受着血痕和淚影的振搖，漠然置下了耳畔砲聲與機聲的合奏，而片段地，寫出我雜亂無章的，回憶和感想。</p>
<p>㊀平津淪陷的意義是什麼？</p>
<p>公歷一千九百三十七年的七月二十九日，也就是大中華民國二十六年的七月二十九日。這一天，世界上發生了一件非常的巨變，那就是：——</p>
<p>中華民國的名城北平，竟然淪陷在日本帝國主義者血腥的魔手裏了！</p>
<p>緊接着，距離北平南面一百四十里的天津，又遭受了同樣淪陷的命運。於是，敵人的勢力，在南面，就沿着平漢，津浦兩棧，一支進展到長辛店，良鄉，另一支，却進展到了馬廠，獨流一帶，在北面，就沿着平綏綫，一直進展到居庸𨷀，和南口。在這一大塊敵人以暴力佔領區域後面，却拖着兩個進兵的孔道：一條是由關外運送陸，空軍的北寗路，另一條，是由海上運送海，空軍的大沽口。到了這時，敵人戰略的情勢，已經非常明顯了；她是企圖用平津做根據地，以偽﹁滿﹂和渤海做後方，向我們整個國家和民族展開了蠻狠的侵略戰！這麼着，面對着她這種暴虐的戰略，我們的態度，祇好陷入於抗戰到底和屈服到底的兩途中仟攆一途的命運，而絕無走第三條路的可能。—什麼“忍辱求全，”“暫時妥協，”等等，到這時，根本成了失時的廢話了。</p>
<p>何况，北平是我們幾百年的故都，是我們數一數二的“文化城，”是華北的軍事重心和交通樞紐，天津是華北的經濟重心，大沽口又是華北的第一個港口。沒有平津就沒有華北；而華北失去後的中國在資源方面，也就根本動搖了獨立的可能。中國沒有華北，不能立國；華北沒有平津，不能保全，這是非常明顯的事實、除開上述的戰略關係不論，僅僅就這一點說，假如中國在容忍敵人佔頷平津的狀態下苟安着的話，（其實，無論從那方面看，這種假設是不可能的。）那末，也就等於亡了一半。</p>
<p>我們又記得，蘆溝橋事件後的不久，在廬山的全國學者名流談話會裹，我們政府的最高當局們，曾經一再地，宣示過對於保衛領土主權的决心。而七月十七日蔣委員長的談話，尤其確切地指明了：敵人如果侵襲北平，中華民族就到了犠牲的最後關頭。蔣委員長這篇談話，一直到七月二十日，才由中央社的十九日電訊，傳播到北平，給予了冀察當局當時正和日方進行的苟安談判，以一個當頭的棒喝。這，在冀察的一部分當局方面，或許可說是有了個猛醒的機會，陡然地明白了政府眞意的所在；然而，在敵人方面，却原是意料中事。她的步驟，還是照原來那樣的，一絲不亂；一面表面敷衍談判，作為緩兵之計，另一面，却迅速增兵，準備武力佔領。如果說，日方是不明瞭我們政府當局的决必，而祇是希圖措進攻平津，作為威脅，以達到某種企求的話，那，我們未免太小看敵人了；正因為她明知道我們政府是有决心的，所以，不得不先下手為强，佔領了平津，而露骨地向我們挑戰。所以，這一回，敵人是故意把教們向絕路上趕去的！中華民族是有出息的，她當然不會再忍受敵人的零刀碎剮，那末，其唯一的必然結果，就祇有起來抗戰！</p>
<p>同時，我們要知道，現代的世界的和平，原是不可分的，中日的全面持久抗戰，一定會引起世界大戰的爆發；而這個下一回的世界大戰，却是人類文明大規模的毀滅。這些，早已成了一班人的常識，决不是少數識者的獨見，或少數人士的杞憂了。這些淺近的道理，敵人方面，也當然是明瞭的。明瞭了而硬要這樣做下去的道理，又是什麼呢？一句話；第一個理由，是為了衝破她自身國際關係的孤立，加强法西斯國家集團的團結；第二個理由，是為了延續資本主義的命運，尤其為了想從世界的大混亂中，使幾個垂斃的少數資本主義的國家，從新膨脹起來。</p>
<p>總結起來說，下决心佔領平津的，這一回敵人的眞意，我們要澈底認清牠：第一，與其說是要避免引起中日間全面的持久抗戰，不如說，是正逼我們向全面持久抗戰的路上走；第二，與其說是擔心引起世界大戰的爆發，不如說，是正想促進牠；第三，與其說是對於人類文明將要因之毀滅大部份這件事不了解，不如相皮地，說是意識着使牠實現，以便少數資本主義的國家，可以冒險取倖。進一步說，如果，日方沒有這些一貫的認識與决心，那末，以平津那樣國際關係縱錯，中國萬分重視的地域，她絕不會冒然而且悍然加以佔領的。</p>
<p>美國某報，拿﹁玩火﹂這譬喻，去說明日本這回在華暴行對世界全局的意義；由我看，倒是﹁放火﹂更加確切些吧。</p>
<p>中日全面抗戰的烽火，是點着了；世界大戰的信號，是起來了；人類文明的喪鐘，在響了。｜｜這就是這回日本帝國主義者使平津淪陷的整個意義。</p>

<h3>Enemy Attempts All-Out Assault on Yangxing and Yuepu</h3>
<p>Breakthrough at a Certain Point on My Yangxing First Line. Our Troops Actively Counterattack, Demonstrating Superiority. Enemy Concentrates Bombardment, Causing Minimal Damage to Us.</p>
<p>A reporter from this newspaper inspected the front lines at □□□□ and other locations last night at 7:00 PM and returned to the office at 2:00 AM this morning. The battle situation in Luodian was relatively quiet. The enemy's naval gun sounds in Yangxing and Yuepu also gradually became sparse last night. The artillery fire in Wusong was dense, and enemy aircraft were extremely active in Zhabei. The reporter met with various military officers, and the comprehensive discussions and battle situations from all parties are as follows: ㊀ The enemy initially attempted to use the old tactic of flanking from the left and right wings, employing full force to attack Luodian, attempting to extend its left wing and create a large encirclement of our troops. As a result, the enemy in Luodian was surrounded, and this military plan had to be abandoned. They switched to a central breakthrough strategy. For four days, the enemy has been launching all-out offensives from the sea, land, and air in the central areas of Zhanghuabang, Wusong, Yuepu, and Yangxing, intending to break through any point on our central lines to cut off our communication. Enemy warships and heavy artillery are concentrated on a certain location, conducting intense suppressive fire to destroy the traffic for our reinforcement troops' movement. However, as of now, the enemy's concentrated bombardment has caused minimal damage to our military. The breakthrough points have only advanced or retreated by a few hundred meters, which is truly not worth the cost. The enemy's plan has clearly suffered an unexpected and serious blow. ㊁ The enemy's concentrated bombardment of Yuepu, Yangxing, and other locations has continued day and night for the past few days, totaling tens of thousands of shells. Since 2:00 PM today (i.e., yesterday), the artillery fire suddenly became sparse, which may be a symbol of another change in the enemy's plan. ㊂ Our front line in Yuepu has remained unchanged from beginning to end. In Yangxing, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, a certain point on the first line east of Yangxing Town was broken through by the enemy. Our fresh troops have arrived and are counterattacking, and the battle situation is absolutely unaffected. Yangxing Town is still in our hands. ㊃ In Wusong, the enemy and we are still in a standoff at Miaocun, and the enemy's development is particularly difficult. ㊄ In Zhabei, in order to support the offensive on the Wusong-Baoshan line, the enemy has been harassing with small units for several days. We are firmly defending the original front line, which is irrelevant to the overall situation.</p>
<h3>Our Counterattack in Yangxing is Quite Successful</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting Still Underway, We Hold the Advantage, and it is Expected that the Original Position Will Be Recovered Soon</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Midnight report, ㊀ Yesterday's front-line battles were most intense in the Yuepu Town and Yangxing Town line. In Yangxing, our army's first-line position was broken through by the enemy yesterday afternoon. By sunset, we launched a fierce counterattack with fresh troops, and fierce fighting is still underway. Our army is very successful, clearly holding the advantage, and it is hoped that the original position will be recovered and the enemy's westward advance will be blocked. ㊁ In Luodian, our army has adopted a steady and solid, step-by-step strategy. There have been no major battles in recent days. From yesterday morning, in order to coordinate with the enemy troops attacking Yangxing and Yuepu, the enemy launched an offensive on our front with reinforcements from the Xiaochuansha area, attempting to break through. However, our army had already constructed a solid encircling position. The enemy forces repeatedly charged fiercely but were repelled. From morning to night, the battle continued fiercely without stopping. Because the enemy adopted an offensive stance, hundreds of people were killed or wounded. Our army's position, however, remained unchanged. The night before last, our air force came to Shanghai to attack enemy warships. One bomb hit an enemy warship, causing heavy damage. Yesterday, on the surface of the Huangpu River at Yangshupu Dinghai Road, an enemy warship was found to have completely sunk, leaving only a chimney on the surface of the river. It was said that it was the one hit by our plane the night before last. The enemy forces repeatedly attempted to land in Pudong without success. They are now planning to dispatch a large number of speedboats and plainclothes teams to harass our rear. We have already locked the Wuzhen Road Bridge and the Laji Bridge to prevent enemy attacks.</p>
<p>After the enemy's plan to attack the city center and break through our Gonglu defense line failed, they have been concentrating all their efforts to attack our Yuepu-Yangxing line, advancing from Wusong and Baoshan in two directions. For two days, an unprecedented bloody battle has taken place with our army on that line. Our army has fought bravely, advancing wave upon wave. Even under the enemy's dense artillery fire and tank charges, they have stood firm and refused to retreat. At dawn yesterday, enemy warships concentrated their firepower and fiercely bombarded our positions near the northeast of Yuepu and Yangxing in Baoshan. At the same time, more than ten tanks advanced along the Baoyang Highway, with their infantry units using the tanks as cover. Our front-line troops responded calmly. When they advanced to near the Eastern Bridge of Yangxing, our mortar teams at that location immediately concentrated their firepower and launched a fierce attack on the enemy tanks. Under our dense artillery fire, four enemy vehicles were immediately destroyed. Our defending soldiers bravely rushed out and used machine guns and grenades to attack the invading infantry. The enemy was forced to retreat. On the left wing of our Yangxing position, more than a thousand enemy infantrymen were also discovered attacking us at dawn yesterday, supporting the enemy in the central route. Our troops there bravely resisted the enemy. Yesterday, the entire line was plunged into an extremely fierce bloody battle.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Since the enemy forces landed at the Qiujiang Wharf, they have implemented a central breakthrough, attempting to establish contact between Yangshupu and Zhanghuabang. As a result of days of fierce fighting, the enemy forces suffered a disastrous defeat and retreated into the Qiujiang Wharf. They suffered heavy casualties and had no counter-offensive power. The enemy had no choice but to change their strategy. Starting yesterday morning, they attacked our Yangxing and Yuepu areas, attempting to open up the Wusong and Luodian line. From morning to noon, enemy warships concentrated their firepower and continuously bombarded us. At the same time, large enemy forces advanced towards our Yangxing and Yuepu areas under the cover of artillery fire, with tanks as the vanguard. Our army bravely resisted and fought fiercely all day. The enemy in the Yuepu area was repelled by our army, while the first-line position of our army in the Yangxing area was eventually broken through by the enemy. Our army is now awaiting reinforcements and preparing to launch a counterattack on the enemy under the cover of night.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in the Miaocun Area Yesterday</h3>
<p>Our Troops Launch a Fierce Attack, Enemy Lines Waver</p>
<p>The enemy in Wusong launched an all-out attack yesterday, attempting to coordinate with the enemy in the central route attacking Yangxing. Aircraft and warships came fiercely. Our troops divided their efforts to meet the attack, charging and engaging in close combat to contend with them. At 5:00 AM yesterday morning, they attacked our army's right flank position near Zhangjiacun, advancing to near Zhangjiacun and Wujiacun. Our troops stationed in Miaocun rushed to respond, and an extremely fierce battle broke out. Yesterday, the enemy and our troops remained in a stalemate in the Miaocun area. The battle continued last night. Our fresh troops have joined the battle and are launching a fierce attack on the enemy, and the enemy lines have wavered.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The enemy in Wusong suddenly launched an all-out offensive yesterday, with aircraft assisting in the battle, wantonly dropping bombs. Our army temporarily retreated to avoid their sharp edge. The enemy did not dare to penetrate deeply. That evening, we divided our troops and launched a night attack along both sides of the highway near Yangcun, passing through the area between Liujiazhai Xinmu Bridge and Taojiazhai. The enemy had not yet gained a firm foothold and was attacked by us, and immediately collapsed and retreated. By about 12:00 AM, we had recovered our original position. Before long, the enemy attacked again with their main force, with a strong force of about two battalions, attacking our right flank position near Zhangjiacun, occupying the Zhangjiacun and Wujiazhai area and confronting our troops in Miaocun. We are urgently deploying a large army, preparing to strike them hard.</p>
<h3>More Than Four Hundred Enemies Eliminated at Zhanghuabang</h3>
<p>Three Attacks Repelled. The Enemy Suffered Heavy Casualties in Our Pincer Attack.</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The enemy in the Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang area launched a fierce attack on our city center area positions throughout the night yesterday, with six armored vehicles as the vanguard, followed closely by more than four hundred elite infantrymen carrying light machine guns. Our army, responsible for that area, was the □□□ division. Initially, upon seeing the enemy attack, all of them lay in ambush without moving. When the enemy advanced to a considerable distance, they launched a joint attack. Seeing that the situation was not good, the enemy, fearing that their vehicles would be heavily besieged, hurriedly opened full speed and fled in panic. However, the more than four hundred infantrymen who provided cover for the attack were intercepted by us and completely annihilated.</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) The enemy in Yunzaobang and Zhanghuabang was repelled by us to the east of Nantang, along the coastal area. Our army built fortifications on the west bank of Sitang, with solid fortifications and deep trenches. The enemy repeatedly attempted to attack, but has not succeeded. Therefore, the front lines in that area have remained unchanged for several days. At dawn yesterday, they attacked us again, using artillery fire as cover, with their main force advancing along Yunzaobang, attacking our positions at Heicunzhai and Shenjiazhai. Our army bravely resisted. The enemy knew we were prepared and did not dare to advance lightly, and immediately collapsed and retreated. At 10:00 AM, they launched another fierce attack with multiple tanks followed by a large number of infantry. We responded calmly and encircled their rear from both wings, killing countless enemies. The enemy finally could not support it, abandoned their vehicles and collapsed and retreated. The enemy launched two attacks without success, and then, starting at noon, concentrated naval guns and aircraft firepower to bombard fiercely until evening. At the same time, they mobilized three light tanks and two medium tanks to launch another surprise attack on the Xiaoxuzhai area. We intercepted them with mortars and grenades, inflicting heavy damage. In the Hei Yangzhai area, three enemy tanks protected infantry who broke into our lines and were active in our position for several hours. Our army dispersed and lay in ambush, aiming and shooting. The enemy fell to the ground one after another, suffering heavy casualties and no longer having the ability to hold their ground in the breakthrough position. Therefore, they retreated in a disheveled manner. In this battle, the enemy launched three attacks and fought fiercely all day, but was ultimately repelled, leaving many corpses behind.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy in Wusong and Zhanghuabang established contact with the enemy on Binshan and, using tanks as cover, invaded in three routes, attempting to advance in a fan shape. ㊀ The enemy advanced from Binshan to spy on Yuepu. At about 5:00 AM yesterday morning, the two armies made contact at Tanjiamiao. Our army rose up to respond, and the artillery fire was very fierce. Until noon, both sides suffered casualties. Our front line advanced to Dingjiaqiao. ㊁ The enemy in Wusong used four tanks to cover infantry and launched a fierce attack on our position, breaking through Sanguantang and directly approaching Jucun along the Songyang Road. Our army resisted with bloodshed and used mortars to destroy three tanks, killing many enemies. They were preparing to rush out of the trenches to encircle them, but the enemy reinforced with more than a thousand people, swarming in from Songbin Road, joining the attack. Our army firmly defended the eastern suburbs of Yangxing, waiting for an opportunity to attack. ㊂ The enemy troops on the Zhanghuabang road also used three light tanks to break into Nantang River, Heiqiao Shenjiazhai, Xiaoxuzhai and other places at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Because there were many rivers in that area, the tanks were blocked and could not advance. Therefore, the enemy troops following behind suffered extremely heavy casualties in our pincer attack. After our army won the victory, they seized quite a few enemy weapons.</p>
<h3>Luodian Enemy Forces Retreat Immediately After Counterattack</h3>
<p>In Luodian, the enemy in front of our army looked like they were attempting to launch a counterattack to coordinate with the enemy in Yangxing. Starting at dawn yesterday, the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our Caowangmiao position non-stop for about an hour, then the artillery fire became sparse. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy artillery started again and was stopped soon after our artillery gave it a return fire. A small number of enemy troops were discovered in our Caowangmiao position and were surrounded by our troops, killing an enemy major and seizing many documents and maps. South of Chenhuabang, about two kilometers from Yuepu, the enemy in the Linjiazhai area attempted to counterattack our position between Pu'angqiao and Yuepu yesterday, but was met with a head-on blow by our army and retreated.</p>
<h3>Enemy Establishes Headquarters in Xiaochuansha</h3>
<p>Confirmed information: In Chuansha Town, northeast of Luodian, the enemy troops, colluding with traitors, have established a headquarters there. Our military authorities have been paying close attention to this.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The enemy in Luodian has always been under our encirclement, and although they have attempted to break through several times, they have not succeeded. It is now learned that a large number of enemy troops landed in the Xiaochuansha and Shidongkou areas yesterday, preparing to attack us in order to relieve the siege of Luodian. However, our forces are strong, and if the enemy attacks, we will resolutely give them a head-on blow.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Attempt to Attack Liuhe Again</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: There are about seven or eight hundred enemy troops southeast of Liuhe Town. They came surging forward the night before last (the 10th), attempting to attack. Our sentries discovered them and returned to the camp to report. Troops were immediately dispatched to intercept them and repel them. The enemy seems to be probing our army's strength and will launch a large-scale attack in the coming days, but we have made careful preparations. If the enemy attacks, we will give them a counterattack.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Conducted Two Night Raids Yesterday</h3>
<p>Our air force flew to Shanghai for a night raid at 7:15 PM yesterday. In the midst of concentrated enemy anti-aircraft fire, they calmly flew over the Huangpu River and dropped multiple bombs on enemy positions in the Yangshupu area. The enemy suffered considerable damage. Our aircraft turned back at about 7:30 PM, circled once over the Huangpu River, and then safely left Shanghai and returned. At 10:35 PM in the evening, our air force flew to Shanghai again. Enemy warships hurriedly fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns indiscriminately, and then sent planes to take off and engage our planes in a fierce battle, firing machine guns at each other. For a time, sparks flew in the air and gunshots were incessant. The battle stopped after about half an hour. Our aircraft safely flew back.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Drop Bombs on Nanshi and Pudong</h3>
<p>According to information from the Seventh Rescue Team of the Red Cross, at 10:35 PM, several Japanese aircraft bombed Liyuan Road in southern Shanghai. Nearby houses immediately caught fire, and smoke filled the sky. The Seventh Team of the Red Cross rescued two seriously injured people, Shen Jinshan and Chen Zhongyi, from the flames. Both were in critical condition. Two bombs landed at Haichao Temple but fortunately did not explode. The monks of the temple removed the bombs. At about 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, two enemy aircraft flew over the Republic Road at the junction of Fahua and scattered leaflets with absurd wording. All of them were torn up by passers-by.</p>
<p>According to villagers in Pudong, several enemy aircraft flew to Beicai and Yanjiaqiao in Pudong yesterday morning and dropped bombs, destroying many civilian houses, but there were no casualties.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Enemy Aircraft Flew Out Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy has expanded the original golf course east of the Gonda Spinning Factory at the end of Yangshupu Road and converted it into a temporary airfield, which is the largest base for enemy air force activities in Shanghai. It is learned that there are dozens of enemy aircraft stationed at the field. Four red lights and a small flag are placed near the Shanghai Textile Association on the side of the field as a target for enemy aircraft to take off and land. At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, more than thirty enemy aircraft flew out of the airfield. Eighteen of them flew to the Yunzaobang area, while the rest circled the airfield, flying so low that if you stood on the roof platform, you could almost reach out and grab them. The number was like dragonflies in autumn. At about 4:00 PM in the afternoon, the planes gradually flew back one after another.</p>
<h3>Enemy Position Covered with Bullet Marks</h3>
<p>The enemy positions in the eastern district of Shanghai have suffered considerable losses in recent days after being bombarded by our air force and heavy artillery. In order to understand the actual situation of the wharves along the Huangpu River and the true state of the enemy's losses, the reporter departed from the Bund yesterday afternoon and went to the Huangpu River to inspect the area. Along the way, the roof of the Japanese Consulate on the north bank of the Suzhou River was hit by two bombs, and the side of the building was hit by one bomb. The roof of the warehouse next to the consulate was hit by a giant bomb, and the side of the building was hit by two bombs. Part of the goods in the warehouse had been burned, and almost all the glass windows of the warehouse were broken. The Japan Mail Wharf was hit by two bombs, causing severe damage. The roof of the warehouse at the Gonghexiang Wharf was hit by one bomb, and another warehouse was half burned. A warehouse in front of the Osaka Wharf was destroyed by bombing. In summary, only the Huishan, Huangpu, Osaka, and Huashun wharves were relatively intact. The rest were covered with bullet marks and were clearly visible.</p>
<h3>The North China Daily News Published "Letter from a Shanghai Woman" Paying Tribute to Chinese Courage</h3>
<p>Japanese Actions Prove Their Cruelty and Jealousy. Success or Failure Lies in Ourselves. Hope We Take Care of Ourselves.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News published a letter yesterday signed "A Shanghai Woman," titled "A Salute to Chinese Courage." The letter reads: I must first congratulate your newspaper. Your "Three Words and Two Sentences" column is humorous and appropriate. The record by a gentleman in this morning’s article about the definitions of several words in the Japanese dictionary is different from other countries, and can be described as nailing it. This is indeed the real situation. If the Japanese can see themselves as others see them, they will know that they are nothing more than bullies, braggarts, self-contradictory people, and cowards. Their air force can avoid anti-aircraft fire and the pursuit of fighter planes and soar freely in the sky. How brave is that? Above is the vast blue sky, and below is a large group of defenseless refugees. Is that really brave? It's just disgusting! On the other hand, a lonely Chinese attacker, (note, he is attacking in his own country), under the full treatment of the Japanese Navy, knowing that fierce artillery fire will put them to death, still risks flying up. This is truly a courageous act, a bold aviator! I would like to pay my respects to you. The Japanese army has everything in an advantageous position, and it is very easy to get what they want. What they destroyed is not the land in their own country. They have complete mechanized forces, controlling the sea, land, and even the public concession. Gai Yangshupu and Hongkou are both part of the concession. However, the Japanese naval authorities did not say a word of politeness, but ordered people of the two districts, including Americans, Austrians, Belgians, Chinese, French, Germans, Greeks, Italians, Russians, Swedes, Danes, and Norwegians, to leave their homes, threatening them with "If you don't, you will die." If I have not misread the newspaper, the people of the aforementioned countries cannot move an inch without notifying the Japanese authorities and obtaining their permission. Other headlines such as "Warnings to Foreign Ships" and "Foreign Ships Will Be Bombarded" are often seen. In this case, can it be considered that there is still no war and that we are still free people? Alas, our country has abandoned us, and the horrors of war have made us all cowards. "Non-war warfare," what does this mean? Isn't it a shocking farce? Many of the poor refugees have committed suicide. This is not surprising, because this is the only way to escape the tragic world where might is right. Justice has been extinguished for a long time. The Japanese naval minister dared to stand up and make an astonishing joke: "The Japanese Imperial Navy will never take inhumane actions under any circumstances." The Japanese Navy will never admit its mistakes, but every move they make is enough to prove their cruelty and jealousy (the reason why they bombed art landmarks and cultural institutions is nothing more than jealousy) and cowardice (if they are not cowards, why do they have to use part of the concession as a cover and park their warships between neutral countries' ships as a shield?). The Japanese accuse the Chinese army of misusing the Red Cross and other flags, but how can they explain their tyrannical confiscation of foreigners' property (including national flags)? Alas, of course, they are Japanese and can be forgiven. The only truth that can be found in Japan's statement about this "accidental incident" is the statement "We want China to kneel." I came to Shanghai in 1905 and have never seen a real fact that raises China's position and helps China reach the peak it has reached today. What Japan wants is for China to kneel in the dirt, and they have held this ambition for a long time. Japan has no feelings for China. They see China as a weak enemy that can be beaten at will. But is it so easy? Japan has now encountered a united China. If it is given sincere assistance, China will soon become a respected country. Japan thinks that China has made great progress in recent years and has too many Japanese friends. Poor China, what is the value of friendship? It's just empty words. Many individuals often realize this after experiencing painful experiences. China, as a country, will also realize that you yourselves are the best of friends. Poor China, success or failure lies in yourselves. Hope you take care of yourselves. From a woman in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The "definition of several words in the Japanese dictionary" referred to in the letter, the original letter is as follows: There seem to be different boundaries in Japanese dictionaries from other countries. A Japanese student once looked up the dictionary and found the following items: "Accidental Incident" is a dispute with a neighboring country, and it costs us one million pounds. "Sincerity" is a characteristic unique to us, so only we know its meaning. "Cooperation 1" is the action taken by other countries after we have made our meaning clear with bombs, shells, and bayonets. "Self-defense" is (war), which is completely done outside our country's territory. "War" There is no such word in the dictionary, because Japan has signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact and never resorts to force under any circumstances, so there is no need for this word. "Non-combatant" There is no such word in the dictionary either. "The Army and Navy are fully responsible for maintaining law and order and are not sponsored when they do their duty." "Prime Minister" is a complete flatterer of the Army and Navy. "Treaty" is something that China must abide by. "Philanthropist" Only the meaning of this word is the same as the word in other countries, and another boundary is to help the needs of neutrals and enemies for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombard Longhua Temple</h3>
<p>Fifty to Sixty Civilians Killed or Wounded, Beiqiao Elementary School Also Bombed</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) At 9:30 AM yesterday, five enemy aircraft flew to Longhua in southern Shanghai and wantonly bombed, dropping more than twenty bombs in total. Nine bombs landed in and around Longhua Temple. The temple gate was destroyed, and more than half of the Daxiong Hall in the temple was destroyed. One corner of the roof was hit by a bomb. The three Buddhas in the hall were not damaged, but the small Buddhas on both sides and the five hundred Arhats in the left wing were all looted. The empty house on the right side of the temple and the police station on the left corner were also affected, as well as a dozen civilian houses behind the temple. About fifty to sixty civilians were killed or wounded. Police Chief Wang Biao and three police officers were seriously injured. Apart from some of the seriously injured being taken to hospitals in the Special Zone for treatment, Hua Laowu, 41 years old, a local resident, was seriously injured in the head; Xu Diqing, 18 years old, a local resident, was seriously injured in the chest and right leg; Zhang Zuhai, 24 years old, from Shandong, was slightly injured in the right leg. The above-mentioned people were sent to Tongren Hospital, and the rest were sent to Zhongshan Hospital in western Shanghai. A police officer was seriously injured in the left waist and left abdomen. A Buddhist woman in the Nanshi branch of the Red Cross was seriously injured and died. Four people who were killed by the collapse were identified by their families and taken for burial at the time. Xi Tongsheng, Zhang Mazi, a rickshaw driver, and a crushed child's corpse were sent by personnel from Tongren Fuyuantang to be buried. More than ten monks in the temple were injured. Residents in Longhua Town have now moved away completely. Only the whole town was fortunate enough not to be killed. The enemy aircraft was still not satisfied after this massacre and flew to Beiqiao in Minhang and dropped seven or eight bombs. Beiqiao Elementary School was also bombed. Most of the residents in that area have already moved away, so only three or four people were injured.</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation Aircraft Did Not Carry Bombs to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Japanese Reports are Purely Fictitious</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the statement made by a certain Japanese spokesman in Shanghai to foreign reporters that a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) Douglas aircraft had recently carried bombs to Shanghai, the reporter inquired with the person in charge of the CNAC Nanjing office. According to their discussion, CNAC is a Sino-American joint venture, and its organizational nature would absolutely not allow such a thing to happen. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the company's Shanghai-Beiping route has been suspended, and the Douglas aircraft were sent to the factory for repairs. Only one aircraft was repaired by the 10th and has been specifically selected for use on the Hankou-Chongqing route. There was no eastward flight, and the Ming Palace Airport has not yet been completed. It has been almost five months since a CNAC Douglas aircraft landed in Nanjing, which is a fact that everyone has seen. What the Japanese said is purely fictitious.

<h3>He Huansan of Guangxi Donates Rent to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Resist the war for ten years, donate for ten years, resist the war to the end, donate to the end.</p>
<p>Wuzhou Correspondence, He Huansan, a villager in Xiling Township, Gongcheng County, recently felt that the national crisis was extreme and was filled with righteous indignation. He specially donated all of his fields, 300 dan of rent grain from his annual income, for military expenses to resist Japan. He decided that if the war of resistance lasts for ten years, he will donate for ten years, and if the war of resistance lasts to the end, he will donate to the end. He will find another way to make a living. This spirit of sacrificing his family to relieve national difficulties is truly admirable, and the righteous act of long-term support is unprecedented. Zhu Rubiao, the head of the township, has already submitted a request to the county government to forward it to the provincial government for commendation and to forward it to the national government for commendation to encourage others.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Hits Japan</h3>
<p>Floods Inundate and Wash Away Houses; Ships Lost and Transportation Halted</p>

<h3>Our Country Submits a Supplementary Statement of Complaint to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>The United States Prepares to Send Personnel to Attend the Advisory Committee; Our Ambassadors Gu and Guo Arrive in Geneva</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Since the Lugouqiao Incident, I have submitted a statement to the League of Nations on the situation in which Japan has acted, and the full text has been seen in yesterday's newspaper. However, Japan has continued to advance and not only advance but also invade. Our government submitted a supplementary statement on the 10th and telegraphed Representative Gu Weijun to appeal to the League of Nations again. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will publish this supplementary statement at noon on the 12th. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the war between China and Japan, the Advisory Committee established by the League of Nations Temporary General Assembly in 1933 will deal with it. Chinese personnel here believe that there are three benefits to adopting this procedure: ⑴ The question of designating the aggressor nation can be resolved naturally without discussion, as the League of Nations Temporary General Assembly in 1933 has already unanimously recognized Japan as the aggressor nation. ⑵ As a result, the dispute between China and Japan can be automatically submitted to the current session of the League of Nations General Assembly for handling and exert the greatest effect. ⑶ Since the United States is one of the member states of the Advisory Committee, it can participate in the matter. These people also said that the Mediterranean Conference is wrongly discussing the principle of mutual assistance, and Western European countries are also making every effort to maintain the collective security mechanism. Therefore, China's appeal to the League of Nations is well-timed. (Havas Telegraph, 10th)</p>

<h3>Russian Newspaper Satirizes Japan</h3>
<p>Clay Feet Are Unreliable</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Izvestia newspaper wrote, "The China incident has indeed made the Japanese military at a loss. Although Tokyo insists that Japan is not waging war in China, but only carrying out a 'disciplinary action' in order to 'restore the sanity of the Chinese and return to good terms with Japan,' in reality a major war has indeed broken out, and it has broken out at a time when the Japanese military was not prepared, and not at a location it had planned in advance. The China incident is indeed a large-scale war." The newspaper finally continued, "The Japanese military is making sacrifices beyond the strength of its people's and national finances in order to 'cope with this extraordinary time,' but the Sino-Japanese War will inevitably prove that in our era, a pair of clay feet is definitely not a reliable basis for conducting a large-scale war, even if its enemy is a country that has only recently completed national unification. The result will still be the same." (Tass Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Reply to the U.S. Note</h3>
<p>Shifts Responsibility for Compensation; The U.S. Expresses Dissatisfaction</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull previously sent notes to China and Japan, asking them to be responsible for compensating the losses of American people's lives and property in China. How Japan responded to this note is still unknown. When reporters visited Hull, they clearly pointed out that Japan had no intention of accepting the U.S. note, but Hull was unwilling to express his opinion and refused to disclose whether Japan had replied to the U.S. According to those familiar with politics, Hull's attitude shows that Tokyo's reply was extremely unsatisfactory. According to reliable sources in Japan, Tokyo's reply only stated that it was willing to give full consideration to the U.S. note, but it made no mention of taking responsibility for compensation. As in the "January 28th" incident, Japan has never officially recognized this point, although there have been some cases of factual compensation. (National Telegraph, 10th)</p>

<h3>Fujian Province Prepares for Long-Term Resistance</h3>
<p>Increase Production - Awaken the People - Control Traffic - Save Waste</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence, the people of Fujian province, in order to prevent surprise attacks by enemy aircraft, mostly moved to the countryside, and most shops were also closed. Now, the provincial government believes that at this extraordinary time, the people in the rear should intensify their work and actively engage in production as a preparation for resisting the enemy. It has ordered all shops to resume business, increase production, and leave the strong men in the provincial capital to undertake various wartime tasks to avoid wasting professions and consuming time. Therefore, the shops in the city have resumed business one after another, and the city scene has gradually returned to its original state. Women and children who moved to the countryside are also returning to school one after another because the elementary schools have reopened. The Anti-Enemy Support Association, in order to awaken the people, unite and sacrifice for the country, and to instill knowledge such as air defense and rescue, has established 100 short-term public schools, borrowing various schools or cultural socks and public places as school sites. Each household should recommend one person to go to school to listen to lectures, and the police station will send police to supervise. The class time for each school is set at 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM every night. Those who are absent from class for one-third of the time must listen again. The listening time for each period is temporarily set at five days until the entire city's people are trained. As for the traffic control in this province, the plan is now in place. Steamships and cars will be compiled into a general team. In the future, all people who travel by steamship to the upper reaches of the Minjiang River should first obtain a certificate from the Fujian Travel Agency and exchange it for a release certificate from the General Team Headquarters of the ship. If they do not obtain a release certificate, they will not be allowed to attach. On the administrative side, the provincial government has cut down unimportant institutions such as water conservancy, roads, electricity, mines, and various offices, and unimportant projects such as the provincial capital's natural eternity and the electrical plants in the counties have been suspended to save waste and prepare for long-term resistance. At the same time, it has telegraphed the municipal and county governments and various collection bureaus and offices to collect various taxes in the county and province, no matter how little, they should be deposited into the treasury in accordance with the regulations, not deposited, and not affect the urgent needs. The Finance Department will send people to check at any time. If there is any borrowing of names, tax payments or private acceptance or misappropriation, or if there is any corruption or bribery, whether large or small, once verified, they will be punished in accordance with military law. There will be no leniency.</p>
<h3>Taiwanese People Buy Rice in Wenling</h3>
<p>Greedy Merchants Only Know Profit and Sell in Large Numbers; Taiwanese People Also Use Private Goods to Exchange for Rice</p>
<p>Taizhou Correspondence, the southeast and west regions of Wenling are located on the coast, with convenient sea transportation. Since the Shanghai war, rice merchants of Taiwanese nationality have suddenly sailed ships to anchor on the coast and sent people into the interior to buy rice at high prices. However, there are unruly township chiefs who do not report the situation and allow them to secretly buy and smuggle exports. Shizhang, Songmen, and Jinqinggang, which are five or sixty li away from the city, have been loaded and exported one after another. Shachantang, Jiangxia, and Wugen, which are ten li away from the city, Dali and other places have recently discovered that the vessels from the affiliated Pishan and other suspended islands are sold to Taiwanese rice merchants, who make huge profits. The mountains are generally capitalist profiteers, who transport the mountains one after another at night. It is also heard that Taiwanese rice merchants are buying rice in Pishan, and not exchanging it for cash, but exchanging it for white sugar, kerosene, etc. Two bags of rice can be exchanged for four bags of white sugar, and two bushels of rice can be exchanged for one can of kerosene. There are many enemies of rice exchanges.</p>
<h3>Steps for Reorganizing Finance in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>Four Major Banks to Purchase Guizhou Currency, to be Replaced by National Currency Upon Completion</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Guizhou Province is currently undertaking financial reorganization to fundamentally reform the Guizhou currency system. The reorganization method involves starting with the recall of Guizhou currency. After consultation with the Ministry of Finance, the four major banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) are responsible for the recall. Initially, the exchange rate is set at two Guizhou currency units for one national currency unit, i.e., five jiao of national currency buys one yuan of Guizhou currency. This is a provisional purchase price. When a certain percentage of Guizhou currency has been recalled, the Ministry of Finance will determine the official exchange rate between national currency and Guizhou currency. The purchase of Guizhou currency is handled by the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China, publicly designated by the four major banks. The buying and selling of Guizhou currency is conducted daily from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. The amount of buying and selling is determined based on the circumstances. To ensure that holders of Guizhou currency sell in sequence, a limit is set on the maximum amount that each seller can sell per day, which is 10,000 yuan of Guizhou currency. Serial numbers are assigned to the sales orders, and no additional sales are allowed. Sellers holding Guizhou currency must register in advance to arrange the order of sale. After purchasing the Guizhou currency, the Bank of China issues receipts, and the purchase price (in national currency) is paid the next morning. Sellers holding Guizhou currency must trade in Guizhou currency spot, and delivery on the following day is not allowed. From August 16th to 25th, the Guangzhou branch of the Bank of China purchased over five million yuan of Guizhou currency. After a considerable period of time and a reduction in the quantity of Guizhou currency, the statutory rate between national currency and Guizhou currency will be determined. After some more time, Guizhou Province will be able to completely recall Guizhou currency and replace it with national currency. The reorganization steps are divided into three phases.</p>

<h3>Japanese Transportation and Fuel During the War</h3>
<p>— Yi Zang</p>
<p>The panic caused by our full-scale war of resistance against Japan among the Japanese industrial circles is, needless to say, great. Now, I will briefly explain the situation in the two aspects most closely related to the military, namely transportation and fuel.</p>
<p>㊀ Transportation: The Japanese shipping industry was immediately and severely affected after the Lugouqiao Incident. The Ministry of Communications first promulgated the Foreign Vessel and Kwantung Leased Territory Vessel Coastal Route Permit System, and at the same time implemented emergency measures such as controlling the charter market, opening coastal routes, and changing the allocation of ships. However, it is actually very difficult to make the number of coastal ships meet the needs. Although the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry considered the transportation of goods, prioritizing urgency, and devoted all their efforts to adjusting ships, various industries strongly opposed it, and the Maritime Autonomy League could not cooperate with the order. Most ships, due to the risk of being requisitioned and confiscated, changed their registration and transportation direction, and went to Siam and other safe areas. The government cannot prevent this evasion behavior. Recently, due to the expansion of the war, the panic in the shipping industry has become even more profound.</p>
<p>㊁ Fuel: The day after the North China Incident occurred, the coal produced by the Kailuan Coal Mine and the Zhongxing Coal Mine in our country was completely cut off from being exported to Japan. The enemy country's coal demand reached 45 million tons this year, most of which was supplied by our country. Recently, a "coal shortage" has spread throughout the country, and heavy and light industries, chemical industries, and electrical railways, shipping, and other aspects have been significantly affected. Because Japan's No. 1 solid store, the Tsukiji coalfield, has been almost completely mined. Among other domestic mines, there are only a few dozen coal mountains that produce more than 200,000 tons of coal each year. The mining of coal mines also lacks skilled miners, and the annual coal production is less than 10 million tons, while the required amount reaches 45 million tons. On average, there is a shortage of 3.5 million tons of coal per month. Therefore, since July, all kinds of businesses have been saving and tightening their belts. In other parts of Korea and Taiwan, coal mines are also extremely scarce. As for the Fushun Coal Mine, it produces only 8.3 million tons annually, and less than 2 million tons can be supplied to Japan. Therefore, less than two months after the Lugouqiao Incident, there was a nationwide "coal shortage," and the so-called "fuel famine" became a fatal blow to the production direction.</p>
<p>Due to insufficient supply, Japanese coal prices have been rising daily. It is said that the price was only 30 yuan per ton at the end of June, but suddenly increased by more than 40 yuan per ton last month. Therefore, in the industrial center of Osaka, where consumption is concentrated, industrial capitalists are under the heavy pressure of coal prices and are reducing production capacity. If another three months pass, not only heavy and light industries will be shut down, but also major problems will occur in the fuel for other transportation industries and warships and transport ships.</p>
<h3>British Crew Members on Hong Kong Ship Strike Against Transporting Military Supplies to Japan</h3>
<p>Declare Willingness to Go to Jail Rather Than Serve</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The ship "Severn Ree," belonging to the Severn Shipping Company, is currently chartered by the Japanese company Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. and carries coal from Haiphong. It was originally scheduled to sail to Japan yesterday morning, but it has not been able to sail until today because the British crew members on the ship have staged a sit-down strike to protest the transportation of wartime supplies to Japan, which would assist Japan in its war of aggression against China. They declared their willingness to go to jail rather than serve. (Central Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>How to Advance a Favorable International Situation</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Current international public opinion is extremely sympathetic to us. And the overall international situation is also extremely favorable to us. This is an irrefutable fact. Even the enemy has to admit it and express anxiety. The recent plan of the enemy to send authoritative representatives to lobby in European and American countries is a very obvious example.</p>
<p>The creation of this extremely favorable international situation for us is partly due to the result of our launching a full-scale war of resistance against Japan. As the diplomatic correspondent of the London Times said, "Now that China has risen up and is dealing with Japan, its international position has risen to a height not reached in many years." We have a share of resistance strength. We have a share of resistance determination. The international goodwill towards us will inevitably increase by a share. This is the basic principle of using modern diplomatic relations. There is nothing strange about it. But the other half is caused by the brutal behavior of Japanese imperialism. For example, the shooting of British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft is the best factual propaganda for the arbitrary massacre of Chinese civilians by the Japanese army. Within hours, the power of this propaganda has spread throughout the world. Another example is the bombing of the US flagship "Augusta" by the Japanese army. The Japanese authorities announced on the 25th of last month and the 5th of this month that they would blockade the Chinese coast and arbitrarily intercept merchant ships of third countries. This is the most powerful proof that Japan is obstructing the economic labor of third countries in the Far East. This barbaric action by Japan is in fact a declaration of war against other countries with vested interests in the Pacific.</p>
<p>As a result of the evolution of these two situations, international aid to us has progressed from public opinion to action. American crowds held demonstrations and picketed the Japanese Embassy in the United States and the Consulate General in New York. In addition, 68,000 American sailors and workers advocated that the United States implement an economic blockade against Japan until all Japanese troops withdrew from China. This is one end of the action of assistance. Recently, the American economic and opinion circles have also discussed the issue of a joint Anglo-American economic sanction against Japan. It is believed that the effectiveness of Anglo-American economic sanctions against Japan will be faster than the economic sanctions imposed by the League of Nations against Italy. Once the United Kingdom and the United States jointly impose an economic blockade against Japan, Japan's economy could be fatally hit within four months.</p>
<p>The current international situation is already extremely favorable to us. But the question of how to advance and use this international aid to us is still up to us.</p>
<p>We believe that the proactive work of advancing the current international situation favorable to us should mainly have two ends.</p>
<p>First, we should resolutely show the world our determination to wage a protracted war of resistance. To put it plainly, the enemy has already blockaded our entire coast. Our only hope that "no declaration of war will not lead to a blockade of our coast" has been shattered. And whether third countries implement neutrality or not has ceased to be a problem worthy of our consideration. Therefore, we should immediately recall our ambassadors and consuls stationed in Japan, sever diplomatic relations with Japan, cancel all special rights of Japan in China, suspend the principal and interest payments on all debts to Japan, and confiscate all public and private property of Japan in China, in order to show our determination to resist thoroughly.</p>
<p>Second, we should further cooperate with Soviet Russia in using international diplomatic connections. Although we do not have to rush to make the non-aggression treaty immediately evolve into a mutual assistance treaty militarily, we may take consistent steps with Soviet Russia diplomatically to make the actual effect of this palace of peace of the League of Nations able to be manifested in the Pacific. In a few words, it is to speed up the completion of the mechanism of the Pacific collective security system. To sanction Japan's aggression by collective action. In fact, the possibility of realizing this mechanism is great. The question is whether our use is appropriate or not.</p>
<p>We do not have to be afraid of the establishment of the so-called anti-communist agreement between Japan and Italy, or even the trilateral alliance agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy. As long as we do not harm the development of German and Italian interests in the Far East, we believe that Germany and Italy may remain neutral.</p>
<p>The use of strategic war is an extremely important part of our war against Japan. The whole country, from top to bottom, should unite and catch up urgently.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Conference Agrees on Principles of Security Guarantee</h3>
<p>Division of Areas and Surveillance Plans Cause Major Political Difficulties</p>
<p>⊙ Nyon, Switzerland: The Mediterranean Conference opened at 4:10 PM today in the town hall of this town. In the conference room, a horseshoe-shaped table was placed, and representatives from nine countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia, sat around the table. The Albanian government has not yet submitted a response, so the seat remains vacant. As for Germany and Italy, they have refused to participate, so seats have not been reserved for their representatives. After the opening of the conference, a public meeting was held immediately. First, the mayor of Nyon, Schurrani, delivered a welcome speech. Then, the proposal of British Foreign Secretary Eden was unanimously adopted to elect French Foreign Minister Delbos as chairman. The conference then adjourned at 5:30 PM after successive speeches by Delbos, Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov, and Foreign Secretary Eden (the speeches are in separate telegrams). A technical standing committee was formed immediately to continue discussions until 8:00 PM, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 4:00 PM tomorrow. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>⊙ Nyon: Responsible persons of the Mediterranean Conference recently declared that the proposals put forward by the United Kingdom and France are based on the idea of ​​delineating safe areas on the Mediterranean Sea, prohibiting submarines from navigating, and having warships of various countries take on the task of surveillance. After discussions among the representatives of various countries, it is said that a compromise has been reached in principle. Although representatives of some countries have requested supplementary explanations on the implementation methods, it is expected that they will be formally passed by 4:00 PM tomorrow, so that they can be implemented before the 20th of this month. According to this proposal, merchant ships of various countries must pass through designated routes in the future, and warships of various countries can protect them and provide assistance in the event of a submarine attack. The issue of preventing attacks by aircraft or warships (excluding submarines) will be discussed after the above proposal is passed. The response is generally to send aircraft carriers to patrol the Mediterranean Sea so that when aircraft attack merchant ships of various countries, the aircraft carriers can send aircraft to pursue them. In addition, regarding the British proposal to divide the Mediterranean into eastern and western parts, it was originally intended that the British and French fleets would be responsible for surveillance of the western part. It is now heard that the United Kingdom and France will invite Italy to cooperate with them. However, if Italy refuses, the United Kingdom and France will still maintain it separately. As for the eastern sea, the fleets of the Soviet Union, Greece, and Turkey will be responsible for surveillance, while Bulgaria and Romania will not participate. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<p>⊙ Nyon: According to a Havas reporter, after the opening of the Mediterranean Conference yesterday, the United Kingdom and France proposed that the navies of the countries concerned should monitor the sea lanes in the Mediterranean in different areas to avoid submarine attacks, and that the Soviet navy should also participate in the monitoring. This method has now caused great political difficulties. Observers from some countries attending the meeting immediately objected to the Soviet Union's participation in naval surveillance, believing that since Italy had not yet signed the Montreux Convention on the Turkish Straits last year, if the Soviet Union were to participate in Mediterranean naval surveillance now, Italy would regard it as deliberately making things difficult for the country, and Italy would not be able to join the Montreux Convention. In addition, countries such as Turkey, while welcoming the revival of the Mediterranean mutual assistance system presided over by the United Kingdom and France, are worried that Turkey and other countries will cooperate with the Soviet navy in the eastern Mediterranean, while the British and French fleets will act together in the western region, which seems to be participating in an ideological struggle. There are currently two solutions being considered for this difficulty. One is to stipulate that the Soviet Union's monitoring area should be limited to the Black Sea, or to expand the Mediterranean area and include the Black Sea. The other is to recognize in principle that the Soviet Union has the right to participate in naval surveillance, but to persuade the Soviet Union to give up this surveillance right on the grounds that its naval fleet is not sufficient for deployment. It is heard that the United Kingdom supports the second method, but it is not certain whether the Soviet Union will accept it. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>⊙ Nyon: British Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Delbos held a meeting this morning, which lasted for a long time, to finalize the British and French Mediterranean naval surveillance plan. Afterwards, the two had consultations with Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov. Also, at noon today, Delbos hosted a banquet for the representatives of the nine countries attending the Mediterranean Conference, and also made preparatory talks. It is heard that the representatives of various countries considered amending the original proposal put forward by the United Kingdom and France as follows: ㊀ If Italy accepts participation in surveillance, the Tyrrhenian Sea (south of Italy) should be entrusted to Italy for surveillance; ㊁ The Soviet Union will specialize in naval surveillance in the Black Sea, while the majority of the Mediterranean Sea will be entrusted to the United Kingdom and France for surveillance. In particular, the dangerous areas of the Spanish coast in the western Mediterranean will be completely under the supervision of the British and French navies. The United Kingdom and France now hope that this matter will be settled tonight and that the entire plan will be passed on the first day of next week. If so, the plan should be implemented immediately, as the British and French governments have prepared to immediately increase their fleets stationed in the Mediterranean. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<h3>French, Russian, and British Representatives Deliver Speeches</h3>
<p>Upholding International Law, Denouncing Piratical Acts</p>
<p>⊙ Nyon: After being elected as Chairman of the Mediterranean Conference, French Foreign Minister Delbos took the floor and delivered a speech explaining the reasons why the United Kingdom and France convened the conference, stating that piratical acts in the Mediterranean have recently been occurring frequently, and the situation has reached an intolerable level. The United Kingdom and France have therefore convened the Mediterranean Conference to take appropriate measures to end this situation and to implement the principles of international law regarding maritime affairs. It is regrettable that Germany and Italy have refused to participate and have suggested that the Mediterranean issue should be submitted to the London Adjustment Committee for discussion. We believe that the above suggestion cannot be accepted because the nature of the Mediterranean issue is clear and distinct from the issues discussed by the Adjustment Committee, and it must be resolved quickly. The coastal countries of the Mediterranean all have the equal right to freely engage in trade in the Mediterranean, and freedom of traffic in the Mediterranean is of particular importance to some of the countries attending the conference. It is hoped that the conference will quickly conclude an agreement to stop piratical acts and to ease the current tense situation. In recent weeks, the international atmosphere has been quite gloomy, and efforts should be made to clarify it so that various European issues can be dealt with in a good environment.</p>
<p>Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov spoke next, stating that the convening of the Mediterranean Conference at this moment is particularly timely because not only have Soviet ships been harmed by piratical acts, but the Persian Gulf coastal area's communication with foreign countries also relies solely on the Mediterranean as the only channel. The Soviet Union is extremely willing to maintain international order and peace, and is eager to oppose all acts of aggression and violations of international treaties. Now that some countries have refused to participate in the Mediterranean Conference, although those countries all have large merchant fleets, they are not afraid of piratical acts. There are only two reasons for this: ㊀ The piratical acts are directed by those countries; ㊁ Those countries have close relations with the pirates and understand each other. In addition, the Spanish Republican government was not invited to participate in the conference, which is regrettable. We all know the purpose of those piratical acts and which country is responsible for them. However, the name of that country will only be revealed by the victimized countries at the conference. As for the rumor that two Soviet ships were sunk by their own warships, it is extremely absurd and not worth laughing at, because the ships were bombed by aircraft. The Soviet Union is now taking its own measures to protect its ships, but if all countries can take effective collective measures, the Soviet Union is also prepared to participate.</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Eden spoke last, saying that the progress of the conference should be made known to Germany and Italy, and it is hoped that those countries will approve of the resolutions that the conference should adopt. Our responsibilities are extremely important and urgent, and they should be fulfilled quickly. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 10th)</p>
<h3>Italy Takes a Reserved Attitude Toward the Nyon Conference</h3>
<p>Considers the Russian Representative's Remarks Not Surprising</p>
<p>[Rome] Government officials in the Vatican strictly adhere to a reserved attitude towards the Nyon Conference. However, Italy will not refuse to accept the Mediterranean patrol area plan in principle, but it must be accepted under certain reservations. It is believed that Italy will demand that it be clearly stipulated that no Soviet warship is allowed to appear in the Mediterranean and that Germany be invited to participate in the patrol work, as Germany is one of the original maritime supervisors. After the Italian representative has the opportunity to explain Italy's views and propose amendments, they will advocate that henceforth, please must be issued by the Non-Intervention Committee. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<p>[Rome] After Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov delivered a speech at the Mediterranean Conference yesterday, Italian politicians were not surprised. They said that if the Soviet Union uses so-called retaliatory procedures as an excuse to use force, Italy will definitely not regard it as retaliatory procedures, but as aggressive procedures. No action of warships belonging to Italy is sufficient to provoke retaliation from other countries. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch from the 11th)</p>
<h3>British Trade Union Congress Expresses Sympathy for China</h3>
<p>Congress Passes a Resolution Condemning Japanese Atrocities</p>
<p>[London] The annual conference of the National Federation of Trade Unions recently passed a resolution after concluding a foreign policy debate, expressing sympathy for the Chinese people, stating that "what China seeks is nothing more than to live in peace with all countries in order to promote its inherent culture. Japan has launched an unprovoked aggression, which is not only a crime against China, but also a violation of international law and a violation of treaty rights. The organized working class of the world now unanimously condemns it. In addition, the Japanese army, navy, and air force arbitrarily kill innocent residents in China. This conference is deeply angered by it and expresses its deep sympathy to the Chinese people who have suffered aggression and whose houses have been destroyed."

<h3>British Trade Union Congress Passes Military Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>Advocates Strengthening the League of Nations Function</p>
<p>[London] The National Trade Union Congress today passed a national defense policy drafted by the National Labor Committee with 3,544,000 votes against 224,000 votes. This policy allows the nation to obtain full support from labor groups when major international issues arise. The report of the motion mentioned the weakness of the League of Nations, stating that the reason was the lack of British leadership. The solution to this situation is a Labor government, which will soon take power, should have strong enough military equipment to defend itself, and the existing military expansion program should not be suspended before the international situation improves. Sir Walter Citrine, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, then spoke of the necessity of rebuilding the League of Nations. However, before the League of Nations is rebuilt, the responsibility for maintaining international peace should be borne by a country that is adequately prepared and willing to bear this responsibility. Therefore, if that country wants to fulfill its obligations, it has no choice but to increase its military strength. The British Labour Party hopes that in the near future, it will be able to form a government of this kind. However, if military expansion is necessary, common sense dictates that it need not wait for the establishment of a Labor government. "I certainly have doubts about the intentions of the British government, but I especially distrust the intentions of dictators," he said. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)</p>

<h3>Cai Jinjun Concurrently Serves as Deputy Commander of Shanghai Garrison</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance in this city in the middle of last month, the government issued an order for martial law to be implemented, and Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison, was ordered to concurrently serve as Commander of the Garrison. It is now learned that the Central Government, considering the importance of Shanghai's local area in maintaining public order and the heavy responsibilities involved, yesterday appointed Cai Jinjun, Director of the Police Bureau, to concurrently serve as Deputy Commander of the Shanghai Garrison to assist him. It is reported that Cai has already received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek informing him to comply and immediately go to his post.</p>
<h3>Director Li Announces Cholera Discovered in This City</h3>
<p>Refutes Enemy's Slander; Urges Citizens' Attention</p>
<p>The newspaper reported on the 11th of this month that some enemy soldiers were suffering from cholera. Their spokesman even made slanderous accusations to Western reporters, falsely claiming that it was caused by our army using germ bombs. This reporter specially visited Director Li of the Municipal Health Bureau to inquire about everything. According to Director Li's personal statement, since the Japanese army invaded, many people in Shanghai and nearby areas have been displaced, gathering together and living in simple conditions, making them most susceptible to infectious gastrointestinal diseases. The bureau had already found more than a dozen people suffering from cholera among the refugees more than ten days ago. To date, the number of cholera patients has increased to more than 100. It has also joined forces with the Seaport Quarantine Office to expand prevention work. A telegram was also received from Director Gan of the Nanjing Health Office, stating that 19 refugees passing through Nanjing from Shanghai had been found to have cholera. This is sufficient proof that the poor wartime environment is enough to cause epidemics. The enemy's false claim that our army used germ bombs is simply unfounded. It is hoped that the people will pay special attention to their diet and daily life, and never easily ingest anything that is not boiled water and cooked food, and receive free injections of cholera and typhoid vaccine to prevent infection.</p>
<h3>Italy Sends Ship "Endeavour" to Transport Refugees</h3>
<p>Shanghai Still Has 400,000 People in Need of Transportation to Ningbo, Taizhou, and Other Ports</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of war in Shanghai, the total number of refugees from Ningbo, Taizhou, Huangyan, and surrounding areas has been more than 500,000. In the past half month, the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association has managed to send about 100,000 people to Ningbo Port. At least 400,000 people remain in the war zone and are in dire need of relief and transportation. The Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association originally chartered four foreign ships and sent two ships out every day to transport these refugees out of the country. However, the Japanese side, regardless of their words and credibility, broke international conventions and forcibly searched the British and Italian ships of the first countries, arousing the resistance of various countries. The Italian Consul first raised a serious protest because of the search of the Italian ship "Longshan," and engaged in tough negotiations with the Japanese Navy. The Japanese side has already replied. Now, the Italian shipping company has decided to dispatch two Italian ships "Endeavour" to run exclusively on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, transporting refugees awaiting transportation away from Shanghai, in order to rescue a large number of refugees. The Italian flag is specially painted on both sides and on top of the ship. The ship can set sail in the next day or two. The Italian Consul has notified the Japanese naval authorities, stating that the ship is purely for relief purposes and that the Japanese Navy must not obstruct or search it. All parking in Shanghai is temporarily at the Jinliyuan Wharf.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Ryukyu Revolutionary Party</h3>
<p>Ever since the corruption of the Qing Dynasty and the Sino-Japanese War, our Ryukyu people have been plunged into a state of misery for forty years. All those with lofty ideals have wanted to expel those barbarians and coexist with the motherland. However, repeated uprisings have only increased the vigilance of the Japanese bandits and deepened our suffering. But all of this is not enough to extinguish our original intention to restore the country, but rather strengthens it. We know that we cannot live unless we completely destroy the Japanese bandits. Now that the motherland has raised the sacred banner of the War of Resistance against Japan, it is also a good opportunity for the Ryukyu people to break away from the tyrannical Japanese. We hereby respectfully inform the people of China with the utmost sincerity, hoping that they will not abandon the Ryukyu people who have been ostracized for decades. At the same time, we also respectfully inform the people of Korea and Taiwan, we are fellow sufferers. This time, we should be truly awakened, join hands with the motherland, and jointly obtain the path to light and freedom. Do not covet personal peace and tranquility and leave a legacy of disaster for future generations. Ai Fenglu, Ryukyu Revolutionary Association.</p>
<h3>Various Parties Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Total Amount Has Reached Over 80 Million Yuan; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Teams Work Hard to Solicit</p>
<p>Since the issuance of national salvation bonds, subscriptions from various parties have been very enthusiastic in just a few days. Yesterday, the China Farmers Bank, following the Central Bank, China Bank, Communications Bank, and other banks, subscribed to 4 million yuan.

The solicitation team reported to the headquarters yesterday that it had raised a large amount of bonds. The various teams it organized, such as the trust industry, cotton cloth industry, coal industry, new medicine industry, Chinese and foreign grocery industry, silk and old construction industry, etc., are still continuing to work hard to solicit.

It is reported that it will be sent to the Central Daily News within a few days to be forwarded to the front.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Wearing Scout Uniforms During Wartime</h3>

The number of people who registered to participate reached more than 2,000. However, according to regulations, scout uniforms can be used as school uniforms, so there are not a few students in this city who wear scout uniforms. During this period, swaggering through the streets can easily cause misunderstandings in various circles. In order to strictly restrict this, in addition to ordering the scouts participating in the wartime service corps to wear a symbol, those who do not participate in the wartime service corps, regardless of whether they were originally scouts or not, are not allowed to wear scout uniforms during this wartime period for identification purposes.

<h3>Fierce Battle for Two Days and Nights in Yangxing; Enemy Forces Heavily Struck by Our Side</h3>
<p>Our Forces Hold an Extremely Advantageous Position, and Stubborn Enemies Can Be Defeated Sooner or Later; We Still Firmly Defend the Qiujiang Wharf Military Supply Route; Enemy Counterattacks in Luodian and Yuepu All Fail</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) Since yesterday and the day before, enemy forces have invaded Yangxing from Baoyang Road, with exceptionally fierce artillery fire and multiple aircraft assisting in the battle, attempting to open a line to Luodian. After our army fiercely resisted and fought bravely, the enemy forces, led by tanks advancing east from Dinggong Temple and Wooden Bridge House, broke through our army's defense line in Yangxing Town last night under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire. Our elite troops in the rear immediately moved to the front line for a fierce counterattack. From night to morning, the artillery fire was incessant. It was the most intense battle in the month since the enemy's invasion of Shanghai. The enemy forces had not yet gained a firm foothold when they were heavily struck by our army, suffering heavy casualties. As of the time of this reporter's writing, our army held an extremely advantageous position and advanced to the Yujiabang area east of the town. Moreover, another enemy force invaded Yuepu, but our army was prepared and the enemy's plot failed. However, between Yuepu and Yangxing, a large number of enemy planes carried out heavy bombing, dropping incendiary bombs everywhere. The villages east of Yuzhai Bang and Yangxing Town were set on fire and turned into scorched earth.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Yangxing All Night</h3>
<p>Our Forces Fight Bravely to be First with Very Advantageous Situation; Enemy Forces' Corpses Lay Pillowed on Each Other, and Losses Are Extremely Heavy</p>
<p>Since the enemy forces suffered a major defeat after invading from the Qiujiang Wharf with their elite troops and being fiercely struck by our forces, and at the same time, they lost their troops and generals at various points along the line, this caused great anxiety on the enemy's side. Therefore, they urgently changed their strategy, gathering all their existing forces to attack a certain area in an attempt to develop. The enemy's urgent attack on Yangxing and Yuepu in the past two days was the enemy's premeditation. Our army had already anticipated this move and launched a fierce attack when they saw the invasion. The enemy forces always relied on the cover of their artillery fire, tanks, and other vehicles to continuously attack from the northeast outside Yangxing Town, while our front-line defenders calmly responded and were never allowed to succeed. Seeing that the middle road was difficult to attack, the enemy focused on the left and right wings, copying Yangxing. After our army's bloody battle for two days and nights, a certain point in the northeast (i.e., between Yangxing and Baoshan) near Baoyang Road was slightly broken through by the enemy forces. At that time, our reinforcements immediately arrived, responded, and urgently counterattacked the enemy's陣. Seeing that our reinforcements were unstoppable and the front line was fundamentally shaken, the enemy forces also urgently increased reinforcements and stubbornly resisted. Thus, the two sides engaged in a bloody battle between Baoyang Road. The artillery fire of both sides did not stop all night. Although our army was in the midst of artillery fire, none of them fought bravely to be first, and their blood and flesh pressed forward. Soon the enemy's momentum gradually declined, and we gained an absolute advantage. The fierce battle continues to this day. Our army's situation is superior, the enemy's corpses are piled up, and the losses are extremely heavy. Judging from their original intentions, it seems that they wanted to seize Yangxing and then approach Jiangwan, but now it has become a pipe dream.</p>
<h3>Enemy Counterattacks Again at Qiujiang Wharf</h3>
<p>Coming to Harass with a Small Number of Troops; Enemy Forces Retreat After Our Army Bravely Sweeps</p>
<p>After the enemy forces that landed at Qiujiang Wharf were repelled by our forces, the remaining defeated enemies retreated to a small area east of the Military Supply Road, stubbornly resisting.

<p>The military authority received a confirmed report from the front this morning that at around 6:00 PM yesterday, after the enemy forces were reinforced at Qiujiang Wharf, they immediately launched a fierce attack on our position west of the Military Supply Road. After encountering them, a fierce battle broke out. At around 11:00 PM that night, the enemy finally retreated. Subsequently, although enemy ships occasionally fired at our side, the infantry never dared to move. Therefore, as of this afternoon, the enemy forces are still firmly defending along the Military Supply Road line. The enemy forces landed at Qiujiang Wharf on the 6th and attacked our city center. As a result of days of fierce fighting, the enemy forces suffered a disastrous defeat and heavy casualties. On the 10th, they retreated into Qiujiang Wharf and relied on solid buildings to stubbornly resist. The remaining enemies, with the help of reinforcements, rushed into the wharf several times in an attempt to break through our Military Supply Road defense line. They were met with a brave counterattack by our forces and suffered repeated heavy blows. As of this morning, the enemy forces are still confined within Qiujiang Wharf, surrounded by our three-sided siege.</p>

Another enemy plane was also extremely panicked, and it frantically fired machine guns into the air many times and escaped. Our plane then calmly flew back to its defensive area.</p>
<h3>Enemy Seizes Our Merchant Ship and Converts It into a Warship</h3>
<p>This Kind of Action Is No Different from Banditry</p>
<p>In recent days, our air force has launched night raids, dropping bombs and bombing enemy ships on the Huangpu River, which has made them very uneasy. It is now known that the enemy naval authorities have seized our country's merchant ship Changde (originally moored at the Mitsui Wharf to unload coal, but the cargo was not out of the cabin, and the war started, so the ship was seized by the enemy navy until now), and the hull has been converted into a warship. Anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns have been erected on the bridge, cannons have been installed at the bow and stern, and machine guns have been placed on the deck. The six sailors who remained on the ship to keep the fire going have been driven ashore to Shanghai. Now the ship has been opened by the enemy from yesterday, and it has been opening fire at Qiujiang Wharf, Yangshupu, and other places during the day to bombard our positions. At night, it is ordered to drive in to cover the enemy flagship Izumo and hope to disrupt the bombing of our air force. The Changde wheel has a displacement of 3,500 tons, a value of 200,000 yuan, and 1,700 tons of coal in the ship have also been taken and used by the enemy.</p>

<h3>An Old Woman in Foshan Has Commendable Patriotic Zeal</h3>
<p>Generously Donates One Thousand Yuan and Does Not Accept Public Bonds; Awarded a Plaque to Show Encouragement</p>
<p>An old woman, Zheng Liang, in Foshan, Guangdong, is sixty-eight years old. Seeing that the violent Japanese invaded and were heavily struck by the national army everywhere, she was very excited.

<h3>The Enemy's Attack on the Capital Suffered a Miserable Defeat</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] August 26 On the night when the enemy planes attacked our capital, our planes tracked them down and shot down two type 56 land-based attack aircraft within the territory of Chang, destroying the planes and killing the people. The diary of Captain Ōni Miichiro of the plane was found, which recorded in detail the miserable situation of the first attack on our capital on August 15, when we were defeated. The translation is as follows: "The 0900 from the Muki 空队 (Kokutai) on August 15 departed from 大空(Ohmura) with 20 aircraft to attack Nanjing. Aircraft No. 1 of the 1st Squadron crashed, and 1st Class Airman Ota died in battle. The aircraft was hit 42 times. The 2nd Squadron turned into the center of the typhoon, aircraft No. 2 and No. 4 of the 3rd Squadron caught fire and crashed to the ground, and aircraft No. 4 of the 4th Squadron was missing. Sergeant Major Watanabe of Aircraft No. 1 died in the reconnaissance seat. Aircraft No. 2 of the 5th Squadron caught fire and crashed to the ground, and No. 3 was killed in 片船 (katabune). The initial encounter was so unfortunate that it would be even more painful to return to Chiba in the end. I had the determination to jump down and die together, but my body is no longer my own, and I can only hold the machine gun with both hands and pray silently. After six hours of sailing, 20 people were damaged that day: Airman Taisan of the 1st Squadron, 2nd Class Airman Dangyue of the 2nd Squadron, 1st Class Air Ito空曹(Kuso), Sergeant Major Konno, Airman Nakanishi, 全森 (Zenmori)由中(Yuchu) 2nd Class Seizo Suto, Sergeant Major 1st Class Peak 一空(Ikku), Airman Sakurai of 2nd Class Eri: 1st Class Sergeant Major Tanaka, Hoshino of 1st Class (Star Field) 2nd Class Seizo of the 4th Squadron, Sergeant Major Watanabe, Daita Ikkusao, Nanba Ikkusao, Tomikoshi Ikkubado Yu Ichito (Yuichito) Hitsuze, Village Ikkusao, Yamaishi 1st Class Seizo Saito 1st Class Dong, Ogawa Ikkusao, Obayashi Ikkusao, Fujinaga and Kori 空曹(Kuso), Chiba Ikkosao仲谷(Nakaya) 2nd Class 柯(Ka). 空隊(Kutai) means Mukuyjin Naval Air Corps, and 大空(Daiku) means Omura Air Base.

Li, Wu, and Feng were captured in Jiading County and brought to Suzhou. Miao Aqi was captured in Suzhou. The perpetrators all confessed and were sentenced to death, much to the satisfaction of the people.</p>
<h3>Trivial Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Japanese Prime Minister Konoe recently met with Japanese journalists. The reporters raised several points and asked for his opinion, such as how to handle the current situation in the future, how to follow the war cabinet's policy, and how to determine the budget policy for next year, etc. These questions are the most urgent and should be known to the Japanese people. However, Konoe summarized one answer: war. He said that there is no question to consider other than war. This is too reckless and too disregardful of everything. Individuals need to plan and consider steps when handling one thing. How can a country as big as a war alone solve everything? I don't think that's possible. Japan sees our country as a fish in a urn and a thing in a bag. Unexpectedly, this time it encountered our country's brave resistance and sustained resistance, which is like swallowing a bomb. It is appropriate that they are in a hurry and unable to get rid of it.</p>
<h3>A Militarist Country Is Unable to Cope</h3>
<p>The Army School Changes the Curriculum; The Air Force's Enhancement Is Also in Progress</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Japanese warlords, in an attempt to realize their dream of conquering China and implementing their continental policy, do not hesitate to engage in military expansion and invade with the whole country. The country has fallen into a state of wartime terror. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, especially after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, more than 200,000 troops have been mobilized, but they have been suddenly countered by our strong resistance, and they have suffered heavy losses. They have been constantly asking for assistance. The Army Ministry authorities have a feeling of being unable to cope and have decided to change the curriculum of the Army School, which has been announced on the 2nd of this month with Imperial Edict No. 470. The revision of the study period of various schools has been shortened from seven years and eight months to six years and one month to accelerate the training of officers and soldiers during wartime. It is said that this special case was implemented during the Russo-Japanese War and is now being implemented again, which shows the importance of this war. The enhancement of the Japanese Air Force is also in progress. It is for the transfer of specially trained officers and soldiers in various subjects and expands the scope of the adoption of special volunteer officers and soldiers. As for the third increase in the temporary military expenditure for China recently passed by the Japanese Special Parliament, it is 2.2 billion yuan, of which the Army Ministry is 1.422 billion yuan, and the Navy Ministry is 349 million yuan, and the remaining 250 million yuan is for reserve funds.</p>

<h3>Heartrending Memories (1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of this Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>From the fall of Peiping (Beijing) and Tientsin (Tianjin) until the time I, as a reporter, escaped to Nanking (Nanjing), there was approximately one month. What I saw, what I thought, what I heard, and even the various things I personally experienced, every time I recall them, every time I reflect on them, various indescribable feelings arise in my heart. — I don't know if it's sadness, I don't know if it's sorrow, I don't know if it's desolation, I don't know if it's tragic and heroic... In short, it's definitely not a simple feeling. However, within these various memories and emotions, I clearly saw traces of blood and shadows of tears. Now, I am sitting in a tall building in the Shanghai International Settlement. Three minutes ago, right on the main street in front of this room, a stray bullet suddenly flew down. The bustling crowd immediately scattered in panic, leaving only a desolate and empty street. Overhead, there were stray bullets of unknown origin, from time to time, drawing a long whistle in the air. In the distance, constantly, there was a "boom" sound, then another "boom" sound, shaking the earth. — The duller ones were probably bombs, and those that echoed far and near were probably heavy artillery.</p>
<p>In such a mood, in such an environment, it is indeed impossible to write something systematic. But in order for readers to know something about the situation in Peiping and Tientsin, I can only endure the shaking of bloodstains and tearful shadows, indifferently set aside the combined奏 sound of artillery and aircraft engines beside my ears, and fragmentarily write down my disorganized memories and thoughts.</p>
<p>㊀ What is the significance of the fall of Peiping and Tientsin?</p>
<p>July 29, 1937, of the Gregorian calendar, which is also July 29, 1937, of the Republic of China. On this day, a very significant change occurred in the world, namely: —</p>
<p>The famous city of the Republic of China, Peiping, actually fell into the bloody clutches of Japanese imperialists!</p>
<p>Immediately afterwards, Tientsin, located 140 miles south of Peiping, suffered the same fate. Thus, the enemy's forces, in the south, advanced along the Peiping-Hankow and Tientsin-Pukou railways, one branch progressing to Changxindian and Liangxiang, and the other branch progressing to Machang and Duliu. In the north, they advanced along the Peiping-Suiyuan railway, all the way to Juyongguan and Nankou. Behind this large area occupied by the enemy by force, there were two advancing channels: one was the Peiping-Liaoning Railway, which transported land and air forces from outside the pass, and the other was the Dagu Port, which transported naval and air forces from the sea. At this point, the enemy's strategic situation was very clear: she was attempting to use Peiping and Tientsin as a base, with the puppet "Manchukuo" and the Bohai Sea as the rear, to launch a brutal war of aggression against our entire country and nation! In this way, facing her tyrannical strategy, our attitude could only fall into the fate of choosing one of two paths: resisting to the end or surrendering completely, with absolutely no possibility of taking a third path. — What "enduring humiliation for the sake of complete preservation," "temporary compromise," etc., had become outdated nonsense at this point.</p>
<p>Moreover, Peiping is our capital for hundreds of years, one of our top "cultural cities," the military center and transportation hub of North China, Tientsin is the economic center of North China, and Dagu Port is the first port in North China. Without Peiping and Tientsin, there is no North China; and if China loses North China, the possibility of independence in terms of resources will be fundamentally shaken. China cannot establish a nation without North China; North China cannot be preserved without Peiping and Tientsin. This is a very obvious fact. Apart from the above-mentioned strategic relationship, just from this point alone, if China were to passively exist while tolerating the enemy's occupation of Peiping and Tientsin (in fact, no matter from which aspect, this assumption is impossible), then it would be equivalent to losing half of itself.</p>
<p>We also remember that not long after the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, at the Lushan National Scholars and Celebrities Conference, the highest authorities of our government repeatedly declared their determination to defend territorial sovereignty. And Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech on July 17 particularly clearly indicated that if the enemy invaded Peiping, the Chinese nation would reach the final moment of sacrifice. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's speech was not transmitted to Peiping by the Central News Agency's telegraph on the 19th until July 20, giving the Hebei-Chahar authorities, who were then conducting appeasement negotiations with the Japanese side, a head-on blow. This, for some of the authorities in Hebei and Chahar, may be said to have been an opportunity to wake up suddenly, abruptly understanding the true intentions of the government; however, for the enemy, it was originally an expected event. Her steps were still in accordance with the original plan, without a single error; on the one hand, superficially perfunctorily dealing with negotiations, as a delaying tactic, and on the other hand, rapidly increasing troops, preparing for military occupation. If it is said that the Japanese side did not understand the determination of our government authorities, and only hoped to advance the attack on Peiping and Tientsin, as a threat, in order to achieve certain demands, then we would be underestimating the enemy too much; precisely because she knew that our government was determined, she had no choice but to strike first, occupy Peiping and Tientsin, and blatantly challenge us. Therefore, this time, the enemy is deliberately driving them to a dead end! The Chinese nation is promising, and she certainly will not tolerate the enemy's piecemeal torture, so the only inevitable result is to rise up and resist!</p>
<p>At the same time, we must know that the peace of the modern world is indivisible. A comprehensive and protracted war of resistance between China and Japan will inevitably lead to the outbreak of a world war; and this next world war will be a large-scale destruction of human civilization. These have long become common sense for a group of people, and are by no means the unique view of a few knowledgeable people, or the杞人憂天 worries of a few people. These simple truths, the enemy side, are certainly clear about. What is the reason for clearly understanding and insisting on doing this? In a word; the first reason is to break through her own isolation in international relations and strengthen the unity of the fascist state group; the second reason is to prolong the fate of capitalism, especially to want to make a few dying capitalist countries re-expand from the great chaos of the world.</p>
<p>To sum up, in making the determination to occupy Peiping and Tientsin, we must thoroughly recognize the enemy's true intentions this time: first, rather than saying that it is to avoid causing a comprehensive and protracted war of resistance between China and Japan, it is precisely pushing us to the road of comprehensive and protracted war of resistance; second, rather than saying that it is worried about causing the outbreak of a world war, it is precisely trying to promote it; third, rather than saying that it does not understand the fact that human civilization will be largely destroyed because of it, it is rather stubbornly saying that it is aware of making it happen, so that a few capitalist countries can take risks and succeed. Furthermore, if the Japanese side did not have these consistent understandings and resolutions, then, in the region of Peiping and Tientsin, where international relations are so complex and China attaches great importance to, she would never have rashly and stubbornly occupied it.</p>
<p>An American newspaper used the metaphor of "playing with fire" to explain the significance of Japan's atrocities in China to the overall situation of the world; in my opinion, "setting fire" is more accurate.</p>
<p>The flames of a full-scale war of resistance between China and Japan have been lit; the signal for a world war has risen; the death knell for human civilization is ringing. — This is the entire significance of the fall of Peiping and Tientsin by the Japanese imperialists this time.</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai Cables Chiang Kai-shek Reporting on the Situation of Soliciting National Salvation Bonds</h3>

I respectfully submit a summary of the discussions and arrangements here, hoping to ease your concerns. Respectfully, Wang Xiaolai.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, fuel prices have suddenly risen sharply, which is actually caused by coal stores taking the opportunity to raise prices. The general public is panicked. Now, the Municipal Public Utility Bureau, Police Bureau, Social Affairs Bureau, and China Merchants Bureau and Two Roads Bureau, in order to maintain fuel supply, have specially organized the Shanghai Coal Consumption Management Committee to supervise and maintain the coal industry, with the principles of ㊀ strictly preventing treacherous merchants from aiding the enemy, ㊁ facilitating the transportation of the industry, and ㊂ maintaining residents' fuel supply. Yesterday, the Police Bureau delivered 100 coal transport flags to the Coal Industry Association, inscribed with "Shanghai Police Department Special Permit for Coal Transport Pass." It is also learned that the Coal Industry Association is paying close attention to coal weight, and has established a Coal Weight Supervision Committee, and appointed Pan Yisan, Wei Zhida, and Bao Zhexing as standing committee members, Yan Weiqing and Chen Weibin as registration committee members, and Lu Qisheng and Mao Chunpu as public relations committee members. Recently, the Coal Industry Association has been working very hard.</p>
<h3>Ample Supply of Edible Salt, No Worries</h3>
<p>A Total of 90,000 Dan, Enough for Nine Months</p>
<p>According to sources in the salt industry, after the Ministry of Finance's Salt Administration has tried its best to adjust, a large amount of official salt has been shipped to Shanghai one after another, and stored in the Yiyuan area of the French Concession, totaling about 90,000 dan. Special trucks are prepared every day to handle transportation. It is found that the monthly need for edible salt in Shanghai is about 10,000 dan, and the edible salt that has been shipped to Shanghai is enough for nine months. Moreover, there are still shipments arriving every day, so there is absolutely no need to worry about edible salt in Shanghai. At the same time, 40,000 dan of edible salt stored in the abandoned Dongyang warehouse is not included.</p>
