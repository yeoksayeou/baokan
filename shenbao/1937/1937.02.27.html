<h3>避名求實的對華外交（續）</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>林內閣政綱的核心</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>但是，關於對華外交，前內閣的手段實在太拙劣了。字面上常提起甚麼南親問題”，“防共協定”，口頭上常喊着“重大决意”，“武力行使”，弄得來甚麼大效果也沒有。經各方面批判後，織得出一結論：認為今後的對華外交當“避名求實”。——這“避名求賓”的對華外交，是被林首相採用了。　看他解釋大陸政策：“大陸政策，就是向大陸發展……為東亞安定，對於中國，力使了解帝國的眞意……”。對於華北問題，他説：“帝國對於北支、華北），絕對沒有侵略的意圖……”。對於“防共協定”，也不提到口上來了，他用另外的話來表示：“……這時期最重要的是，融和兩國民間的感情，企圖國際關係的明朗化，互相攜手以實現東亞的安定……若有阻害此等企烀者，必進而排除之……排日為中日提攜的障碍，必須糾正……（以上均摘錄自林首相演説）</p>
<p>總之，“排日”或“抗日”，都由於中國“謨解”日本政府的“善意”。要求“東亞安定”，當“一掃中國的誤解”。</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>對林內閣，議員中雖也有不少的質問，但很顯明的，今日的各大政黨，是連防守的能力也很簿弱了（恐遭解敎）。事實上，林內閣的出席議會作報告，也只不過是一穜今日必經的手續吧了。因此，本交特將林內閣的政策分析，同時指出林內閣的政策中心點，仍不外是一個對華政策問題，並且，特應注意：這卽是“避名求實”的外交試驗。——然而是有“越境”的魄力的。</p>
<p>㊄</p>
<p>軍部雖一面在支持着林內閣。同時却也在監視着。林大將在組閣之初，態度是急進的，組閣本部的參謀，卽是代表陸軍部急進派的十河信二。當時林大將所要求的新陸相，也就是軍部內的‘急進論家“圾垣中將”關束軍參謀長，也卽是日本報上説的，“滿洲孩兒聽説坂垣到，連哭也不敢再哭了”的將軍），耍求的新海相是宋次大將，但都被陸海軍上層部拒絕了。在拒絕後，纔又表示妥協。在妥協上，林內閣緩得到支持，同時也就受着監視，政黨雖也不滿意林內閣（不許政黨份子入閣），但却不能反對。</p>
<p>林內閣確此廣田內閣强多了、第一，林內閣是更進一步的和金融資本家攜手了。現藏相（財政大臣）結緘氏，會做日本銀行大阪分行的行長，也曾任過安田銀行的重職，及與業銀行的總裁。而且，新任日本銀行的總裁，卽是所謂“三并謀將”池田成彬。由於池田與結城的合作，日本銀行（卽日本的中央銀行）的機能，也從單純的商業活動擴大到產業活勸了。這分明就是金融寡頭政治的形態。第二，林內閣旣與現軍部的漸進派妥協，且蔚的支持，當然還是可靠的。而且，事實上，由於林內閣的出現，軍部與金融資本家的携手，已更進一步了。在最近的一階段中，成為暗潮之推動力的，還在於財閥間的對立關係，例如三菱與三井的對立等。但——本文不便詳細分析這些了。透露日本現內閣政網——對華政策，是本文的目的。</p>
<p>在此次議會中，聽到杉山陸相説：“現在，極東的蘇聯兵力約十五六師團，戰車，飛機，都很佔優勢，比較下來，日本是屠於劣勢的。要説軍事預算太多了——不多，如何能實現對滿政府及對華政策呢？……”！</p>
<p>然而，在本文寫成時，東京和南京的兩大會議，都還未閉幕哩！（一月十七日）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>德將進攻捷克否</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在最近德外長牛賴特訪問奧國以後。倫敦半官式的泰晤士報忽然登載一個消息。説牛氏此行的目的。是在恲呑捷克。這消息發表於素來保守甚至過於種重的泰晤士報特別引起了國際間的注意從這個消息中世界各國愛好和平的人士感到在嚴重的西班牙問題之外中歐方面另一個巨大的新危機又將醖釀成熟了。</p>
<p>“德國將進攻捷克否。”這是一年來許多敏感的政治觀察者早在探索着的問題。國社黨對於捷克內部許多德籍居民的煽動。近年來是一步步的加劇着。在去年七月。與國社黨有關連的“蘇台德黨”首領漢黎因。曾經親往倫敦活動。謀取英國方面親德份子的資助。在諾侖堡的國社黨大會中。戈培爾與羅森堡更造作謠言。説蘇聯已在捷克建築秘密的飛機塲。準備進攻德國。這以後。在戈培爾指揮下的國社黨報紙。就開始大規模的反捷克宣傳。他們的反宣傳主要分為三點。（一）説捷克的政治是在少數人控制之下。（二）説在捷克的德籍少數民族。在經濟上受到壓迫。（三）説捷克在蘇捷互助協定訂立之後已經成為鮑爾希縱克的堡壘這樣有組織的造謠誣蔑使捷克政府感到非常的震怒和不安因此向德方提出抗議英國方面由於對這種情勢的焦慮。也特別派人往捷克實地考察。據英方以第三者資格考察的結果。證明德方報紙所載的消息。都是過甚其詞的反宣傳。然而在這以後置到現在。國社黨對於捷克的反宣傳。仍舊是猛烈地進行着。</p>
<p>這種反宣傳的目的。是很顯然的。就是德國可以藉口解放被壓迫的德人和阻止鮑爾希維克勢力的伸入中歐。出兵進攻捷克。這樣的軍事計劃。早已在柏林參謀部的熟籌之中了近年來。德國對於進攻捷克的準備。在軍事外交方面都是著著進行着。在軍事方面。國社黨和捷克內部德人的組織連絡。已是公開的秘密。一旦戰爭爆發。捷克內部的德人立期會做外來德軍的響應。是沒有疑問的。同時德國與波蘭匈牙利的密切結合。最近更積極控制奧國。都有在軍事上包圍捷克的作用。至於外交方面。德國一面設法分化小協約。一面企圖破壞捷克與法國與蘇聯的聯合。去年德財長沙赫赫遊歷以後。南斯拉夫的當局已被國社黨的馬克所收買了。而德國不斷詆毀捷克為鮑爾希望寬的堡壘。誣指它國內容許蘇聯建築秘密飛機塲。就是要使它放棄對於蘇聯的互助關係。</p>
<p>等到軍事的包圍造成了。或者捷克在外交上的地位一經搖動。國社黨的侵略軍就可以乘機進攻了。不過就現勢看來。捷克對於德國的計劃是明𫕔的。它本身决不會搖動。也不會造成外交上的孤立。同時英法都明瞭德國一旦侵入捷克。就是歐洲發動大混戰的第一個信號。為了歐洲以至整個世界的和平。它們一定要共同防止德國這種冒險舉動。在這點上。這次倫敦泰晤士報的最先揭露德國併呑捷克的野心。也許正是一個有力的警告。</p>
<h3>英財相內相為國防計劃辯護</h3>
<p>與外交政策並行不悖　財政穩固無危機可言　國防公債案二讀通過下院</p>
<p>［倫敦］政府所提之國防臨時經費案、下議院昨日午後、以三百零七票對一百三十二票、二讀通過、</p>
<p>當辯論開始後、由財相張伯倫就該法案有所説明、繼謂“英國國防政策之目的何在、業經外相艾登在利明敦城發表演説時、加以説明、反對派各黨議員豈以為英國軍備、不應用以達到艾登所述之目的乎、豈以為除艾登所述之目的外、尚有其他用途乎”、張怕倫復謂、“政府每年財政歲入、凈數約計四十萬萬鎊、職是之故政府實行國防計劃、不至使收支平衡相差過鉅、”</p>
<p>最後申內相西門結束辯論、其言有曰、“以目下還必須論、英國國防、亟須在實質上大事擴充、政府與反對派對於此層、所見略同、並無齟齬之處、抑政府所採方針、乃欲促進國際協調、藉以鞏固世界和平、今兹向下院提出之國防特別經費案、並非一種新政策之表現、我國整軍經武、實乃環境迫之使然、初非放棄原定方針之謂、特採用一種新方式、俾此項方針、得以發生較大之實效耳、英國並非黷武之國、已有事實為之證明、其所力行不懈者、惟維護和平而已、此則舉世各國、無不週知之、所惜某某國家、軍備强大、而又處身國聯會之外、因而集體安全制之實施、乃愈感困難也、”西門又謂、政府對於調整陸海空軍三部事務以及防空問題、自當特別注重、其中關於防空一事、並已另組參謀部、其規模至為廣大、其工作人員多係民政官吏、俾與各省市當局通力合作、至於毒瓦斯面具、每日產額、已達十萬具之多、儘足數用云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英國國防公債案、今日提出於下院二讀時、財相張伯倫對於反對派之論點、曾加以嚴厲之駁斥、張伯倫將政府提案加以辯護之後、反對黨卽由李斯史密士代表、向大會提出議案、主張拒絕政府之建議、季氏之動議稱、講會對於多量競爭性質國防軍備之積集、不勝遺憾、並反對以舉債之方法、籌措國防費用、因此議會對於此種足以削弱國家信用、增加物價以及抑低生活程度之辦法、並因其對於奸商營利無法制止、國防整個計劃缺少調整辦法、故不得不拒絕施行之云、</p>
<p>李斯史密士稱、國防調整大臣毀斯基涌並無解决事變之能力、不過各國防機關中之一緩衝物、於各機關以舉債之方法儘量羅掘時、略加調解云云、李氏復對於殷斯基浦演説中、所宣示之調整及設計之限度、表示不滿、彼稱現在議會中之大臣、共十七人、其中十三人均應受戰事籌備之質問、但殷斯基浦究竟是否在謀此十三人間之調整、實覺毫無左瞪、李氏繼復主張組織民政設計委員會、俾對於國防問題與帝國國防委員會並行工作、</p>
<p>李氏謂彼不願接受財相張伯倫或張怕倫所引證著名理財家凱恩思等之口頭保證、彼認為國家舉債之權力應加以保留、而用之於軍費缺少商業頹敗之時、以制止經濟衰落之相乘於無備、但政府計不出此、倘他日軍費用竭之時、卽羅掘俱空之日、勢將造成百業頹敗之巨災云、李期史密士又稱、希特勒氏之一舉一動、莫不以利之所在為目標、他國則着着讓步、英國前此亦巳屢讓、如此則衆人將被導入歧路、而於無形之中、亦引希特勒着着前進、但彼不信英國將始終退讓但倘美國不使德國元首了解英國所能忍受之限度、恐將籌成不可挽回之大錯云、</p>
<p>張伯倫至是發言、開始辯論、謂上星期阿特里氏曾稱、國防借欵議案、為戰爭計劃”今决議案中無此一言、渠殊為之欣慰、財相繼稱、如在並無理由可認戰爭近在眉睫之時、鰓鰓過慮、抱此恐慌、則實為甚不幸之事、至謂下院對於大舉競爭擴張國家軍備殊為疑懼一節、渠本人對於歐洲之重整軍備、及各國因此所需之不生產的巨大經費、亦為驚心動魄、卽在今日、前途殊少樂觀之際、渠仍不為之失望、而圖覓得新塲合、俾各國可重相接觸、以免此種愚昧行動進行至不可挽回之地步、惟非俟已經籌備國家之安全、而具有履行國際義務之能力時、未便稍懈、工黨對於政儲重整軍備程序之與其外交政策之關係、屢次假託不知、殊可扼腕、要知此項關係、早由外相剴切闡明、而反對黨各議員對於外相之言論、仍置若罔聞、故渠今重述外相之言論時、當請下院原諒也、</p>
<p>財相至是乃宣讀去年十一月二十日艾登在里明頓所發重要之宣言曰、“此種武器、永不用以作侵略戰爭、永不用以求達與國聯盟約巴黎非戰公約相牴觸之口的”財相於是詰問工黨發言人、是否以為英國之武器不應用於外相所述之任何目的、或是否以為應用於此外之任何目的、渠非俟工黨不復閃避此種爽直之問話、而作明白之答覆、則不得不嚴重對付此種含混不明之責雞、財相次乃評駁工黨指政府之建議、足以減弱國家信用、抑低生活程度及議案中未含有防杜逾分營利之有效辦法之責言、謂在與重整軍備程序有關各問題之全部中、其最受一再聚精會神之注意者，莫若防杜物價暴漲之一事、渠放謂凡人類智力所能及、體力所能成以求達此目的之事、未嘗稍有未為者、財相乃詳釋、財部為此事所建設之機構、及籌畫此事所依據之原則、而曰“君等可信余言就財部觀察點而論、余對於適當保護納稅人利益一節、殊為滿意也”、</p>
<p>財相繼言、或謂政府之建議、足使國家信用蒙不利之影響、且一方而旣消耗龐大之軍備費用、而一方而復須舉債以應付此費之一部份、殊使人心紛擾云云、此種言論、殊背事實蓋在已往六年中、國家信用業已逐步臻於種固、當經濟厄運期中、共他各國之負債額、均見增加如美國之國債、在已往六年中、增高英金三十三萬萬鎊有奇、而英國則遠不及之、英國雖須中止其償債基金、但在一九三三至三六年之三年中、英國國用之剩餘、逾四千萬鎊、此外尚償付債項達三千二百五十萬鎊、故其餘七干二百五十萬鎊之多、而失業保險基金、今亦甚形裕如、所儲備之欵、如不分配、則知本年年杪其總額可至五千二百萬至六千萬鎊之間、再則國債之眞正擔負須以常年之償付為衡量、一九三一年英國國債之息金為二萬八千二百五十萬鎊、是年償債約二萬一千零五十萬鎊、故卽就省下之息金七千二百萬鎊一項而論、已足供議案中所議募債一舉之平均費用、同時生活程度則賴社會事業之經費、繼長增高、足資保護、查工黨政府最後一屆之預算案、當時雖失業者甚衆、而社會事業經費僅規定四千五百萬鎊、本年失業者雖已大減、而此項經費則有六千八百萬鎊、</p>
<p>財相次述及工黨預料政府之政策、將造成通貨膨脹一節而引昨日經濟家凱恩思演説中之言以駁之、蓋凱氏曾謂財政部之舉債四萬萬鎊並無引起通貨膨脹之虞、財相表同情於凱氏之言、卽國民可有的儲畜、或尚有其他需要以動用之、而政府今所募之數、僅將動用其一小部分是也、故通賃膨脹之説、純為一種幻想耳、</p>
<p>財相末稱、工黨建議國防經費之全部、應以當年稅收應付之、果如年言、則須大增賦稅、是將使財政之正理陷入危險之邪道</p>

<h3>豐台日軍亟謀建築練兵塲</h3>
<p>加藤談經濟提携問题　亦知須互利方克有成</p>
<p>北平通訊、丰台自日軍增驻一聯隊後、最初曾擬購地修藥大規模之飛機塲·及增建營房、經冀察當局迭次交涉、始行中止、最近該處日軍、又購妥大批磚石、正在卸運、準備添建營房、據悉日軍方面、及未放棄其以前之主張、藉口人數較多、營房不敷住用、故添築營房、並因駐軍旣久、不能無訓練處所、故準備在營房左近覓相當面積之地畝、修築練兵塲、其地畝採用購實·或租·或借、尚未確定、據日代辦加藤談稱、豐台日軍擬建練兵塲説、余曾聞及、此乃駐軍區附帶必需者、現駐軍已向冀察當局進行商洽、不久可望得到圓滿解決云云、聞當局對日軍擬建之練兵塲、認為無異飛樓塲、仿將繼績交涉制止、</p>
<p>關於中日經濟提携問題、據加藤談、中日提携根本要義、卽在使兩國能互相明瞭與認議、然此又需有媒介之物、方可期達目的、故日大使館方面、已準備於下月間映演日本電影、招待各界參觀、此舉之目的、卽藉以傳佈日本之眞正情形、而達增進兩國之親善、對經濟方面、尤盼能提携、使兩國有無相通、但决無侵略之意、蓋凡事皆須互利、方克有成、片面利益、暫時可行、永久則不能存在、在文化方面、吾人亦願與中國方面互相交換·提携、則彼此諒解、自易作到、余現所談者、偕為原則云云、加藤並稱、龍烟鐵鑛開採問題、中日雙方雖曾進行、但其內容及具體辦法、余未詳悉、李思浩·陸宗輿·兩氏、最近亦未謀面、椎此問題雖係軍方協助、而以興中公司為主辦、然兩方皆非有錢者、仍須仰給於資本家、為數且不在少、故出錢者不能不打算盤、於是調查人員前來、自然的繼續不斷、在中國方面、亦須有利、方可舉辦、故迄今仍在調查與考慮之中、至於開採究以投資·合資·抑中國自資·聘用日本技術人員進行、雖未决定、余意以為祇要互利、方式如何、可不必講求、至取締遊戲塲與賭局問題、業已實行、現非法營業均已停止、惟執其業者如刑塲之犯人、因生計所關、難保其不再犯法、故除加緊防範外、對彼等之善後問題、亦曾加以考慮、現在研究辦法、同時希望華當局保獲協助正當日商云云、</p>
<h3>日本第七十次議會的“進一步退兩步”(續)</h3>
<p>比較有趣味的、是植原質間軍部反對宇垣組閣的事、那一霎時間的植原、頗有不讓濱田國松專美於前的氣概、植原質問、“據一般國民所解釋廣田內閣的崩潰、主要由於軍部的行動、後來宇垣拜命組閣、宇垣的政策政綱、我們政友會並不知悉、但我想一般國民對於宇垣組閣、都抱有熱望、然而宇垣終因軍部三長官的反對、卒至組閣流產、三長官反對宇垣組閣的理由、據説是宇坦若組閣、肅軍工作必受妨礙、可是宇垣大將本人就是皇軍之一人大將　閣、何以妨礙肅軍、宇這道理我眞不懂、“這個問題的提出、與其説是挑戰主義、母甯説是暴露主義、實際上當然不會得到什麼滿意答覆的、所以林的答覆只説、一關於這問題、不是我所可以答覆的、况且這個地方、也不能答復、”於是全塲議員、卽是緘口了、</p>
<p>㊂预算案和增稅問題日本昭和十二年度預算案、馬塲藏相時代、巳經提出於讓會、新內閣成立後、將它撤回、連同增稅案加以修正結果、新藏相結城豐太郎將總數的三十億四千萬元、减去二億六千九百萬元、所以這次重新提出的預算總額是一十七億七千萬元左右、表面上似乎削减百分之八點五左右、不算太少、但骨子裹所減削的絕大部份——一億五千萬元——並非是軍事或任何各省的經費、而是補助地方政府的費用、至於軍事費雖暗中商得陸海軍同意、各將頂算中的兩千三百萬元、延至後年度支付、然而新年度預算案中、並沒有削除一分一釐、所以民政黨議員財政學專家山崎克的質問、很有趣味、“結城財政為緩和物價之故、將預算减去二億六千九百萬元、藏相把這稱為‘同意實行額’、而預算案則就馬塲前藏相的原案提出、這使我們以什登他對魚來審議呢、”“把現內閣的修正案一看、可知對於地方上减輕負擔的要求、並未加以容納、而軍事費反在比例上由百分之四六增至百分之四九、除了國債費佔百分之十六外、行政費只佔百分之三五、”“在結城的修正案中、來年度增加的預算額、軍事費竟變成佔了八成、行政費只沾一成多、現在陸軍還要繼續增加六個年的國防費、如此下去、將來我國的預算、不悉沒有完全變成國防費的一天、”“假使我國當眞需要那麼大的國防、就是把全部預算、都充國防費、也是人民所情願的、但現在决不是那時候、”</p>
<p>接着、川崎又對於結城的增稅案、物價騰貴的對策公債消化能力、貿易政策等分別加以質問、最後要求結城答覆對於日本財政前途、畢竟有什麼見解結城的答覆是、“率直地講、我對於我國財政的前途、實在看不透、”</p>
<p>台下聽到這樣意外大膽的答覆、都不禁哄笑起來、但顯然不是惡意的笑、而且有人説出、“憑結城這誠懇的態度、大臣考試可以及格了、”同時鼓掌的聲音很大、我們在旁聽席上、只覺得很被感動、感動的是像結城這樣日本僅有的財政大家、對於目前日本財政、竟不能把絲毫的自信、完全供認財政政策的盲目性、而同時日本所謂國民代表的講員們、還不能不在這“看不透”的財政迷原上歡迎他、所謂資本主義之“鐵的命運”畢竟不能逃避、</p>
<p>城答辯後、川崎又上豪説、“方才藏相説不能看透財政前途、我對這態度覺得滿足但是、所以不能看透的原因、不是因為根本看不透軍專費一點嗎、現在我要請問軍部大臣能否為了國民經濟的健全發展從事减削軍費呢”對這一質問、先是結城答覆、“大藏省固不是與軍部立於對立地位、但也不是追隨軍部、而是相互抱起來向前邁進的、隨後陸相衫山元登臺答辯第二點、杉山一望而知是沒有議會經驗的人、軍人的態度充分表現出來、“現在蘇聯在遠東的兵力、有十五六個師團、並且有與這數量相當的飛機和戰車然而我國在那邊、只有東京與久留米兩個師團、飛機和戰車、也極劣等、這都是國防力不完備的證據、這回的預算、無論怎樣説、都是必要不可少的你們大家也要對於國防再深切認識認識才好、”</p>
<p>這樣反擊的態度、連第二天的報紙都看不過去、紛紛為政黨暗抱不平、但當時議會中的政黨紳士們、却只聽見他們喊聲“這不是感威脅”此外還有些人報以掌聲、</p>
<h3>五·“敗北主義”的情調</h3>
<p>日本第七十次議會中、既成政黨雖出了相當風頭、但始終沒有澈底應戰的决心、被“敗北主義”的畏怯情調所分配結果對於他們所指摘、所不滿的內閣及其背後勞力支反只有屈服和讓步、二月十七日東京朝日新聞社論説、這次議會、“已變成單純的對政府演説拍手的機關、”可謂一語道破、事實上濱田國松的英勇的言辭、只換取了一個擯拒政黨參加的內閣、小泉和植原的貿問、僅僅暴露這些質問本身沒有决心作後質的悲哀、川崎問難的結果、是使一個自認看不透財政前途的大藏大臣獲得熱烈的歡迎、還附帶一個結果是受新陸軍大臣一頓敎訓、</p>
<p>“進一步、退兩步、”想不到正適用今日日本的議會、（中央社二月十七日）（完）</p>

<h3>去年之絲業及今後應有之認識（三）</h3>
<p>— 朱筱和</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>上述兩節，可知去年之絲業，乃在初萎後榮的趨勢之中，故下半期的較見良好，吾人尚不能引爲滿意。在第一節中，作者已提及去年華絲輸出，較上期减少一四，五七九担，兹願再申述之，以促國人注意。蓋年來華絲，在世界市場上之日被排擠，漸次失其立足之地。按去年華絲輸美僅及日絲三十分之一。在英僅及八分之一，在法雖較佔優勢，但爲數式微。揆厥原因，固由日絲之劇烈競爭，而華絲本身之種種缺點，亦爲自取衰落之一大因素。在今日國內改良蠶絲業之理論，已屬汗　牛充棟，而作者再以其犖犖大端者，略舉一二，敢供閲者，以作今後應有之認識。</p>
<p>A保障絲商不應疏忽蠶農　日本蠶絲傳自中國，得科學之助，産製兩方均突飛猛進，發展至今。堪稱已達頂點，故不得不限制産量，以免蠶農受豐收繭賤之苦。製絲方面，則提高生絲品質，以佔優越之地位。返顧吾國一切狀態，落後尚遠，邇來蠶種改良，繭價統制雖見實施，品質檢騐亦將試辦，外銷絲業或可得而轉機，但蠶農利益却因此而蒙相當損失。蓋繭價既受統制，蠶農每不能得售善價，蓋繁榮絲業，保障絲廠商之利益，固屬要圖，但疏忽於蠶農本身之經濟，則頗失策。吾人屢聞農民因數年來之育蠶，非僅無利可圖，且每多出不敷入，因此而不再養蠶，鋤去桑樹者已常見不鮮。故吾華絲業，既未克達到擴大産量之願望，而已受到相當之阻力，此則深堪注意者也。</p>
<p>B集中財力，强化生産　邇來華絲失敗之原因，其由國內絲廠資金分散，規模狹小，亦爲一大原因。蓋各個絲廠財力不足，設備簡陋，出品既雜，産量亦少，成本反因此而高昂，致售價亦難與日絲競爭。去年無錫之興業公司，集中資本，統制十數家絲廠行政，改良生産工具，擴大産絲能力，及减低製絲成本，諸能因此而奏效，實爲我國現今絲業之對症良藥。</p>
<p>C品質標凖化，産額規律化　産絲品質無一定標準，使國外用絲者，採贈時無法預算其用途，而吾國甲廠之生絲每與乙廠之品質各異，在推銷方面，亦僅堪承接零星賣買，不能大帮交易。在産絲方面，復因産量向無規律，每多不能如期交貨，及不能立時供給較大之訂貨，因此種情形，對外頗難樹立商業信用，更難留得良好印象。</p>
<p>D研究購者心理，適合購者用途　在商業戰爭日益尖鋭之今日，研究購者心理及適合購者用途，已成爲最重要之策略。蓋知己知彼，方能適應今日之環境也。如國外最所需要之絲品爲何？最合其經濟原則之絲價爲幾何？如能知其究竟，則可應其口胃，合其價格，應其所需，投其所好，則絲銷當可轉而順利。如前年永泰絲廠某君，考察美國紡織界歸來，即督促該廠，着手製造九○分均度下以之高級白廠絲，其銷路果得非常暢順，故是年雖國內絲廠頗多虧蝕，而永泰則獨能獲利，此非偶然僥倖所能致也。</p>
<p>E研究改良，科學無止境　現今社會，日新月異，不能適合環境，則遭天然之淘汰。在絲業方面，十數年前，吾華輯里絲及土製絲之銷運歐美，其數何等宏大，而今則趨於没落。美國等處之用絲，初僅以條紋粗細爲標凖，而今已以均度之佳美與否爲取捨。且最近因鑒於日絲之品質日益優良，故今年起美國之用絲，亦將提高品質，或許數年之後，現今市塲最流行之七八均度之白廠經，亦將被更優良之絲品，擯之於淘汰之列矣，故希望吾華絲業界，對於提高品質一途，加以深切之注意。</p>

<h3>上海實騐小學概况（四）</h3>
<p>本報特訊　胡祖蔭調查</p>
<p>四，教學方法</p>
<p>該校教學方法可分三種：（一）五六年級國語，算術，社會，自然，四科試行個别教學法；（二）三四年級常識科試行問題教學法；（三）一二年級各科試行整個教學法。現將該校各種教學方法簡要介紹於后：</p>
<p>（一）個别教學法：五六年級試行個别教學法的目的是在：</p>
<p>（一）使兒童養成自學的能力，克己的精神，踏上近乎中學生活的第一階梯，而逐漸謀溝通中小學的生活。</p>
<p>（二）使兒童明瞭學習目的與學習歩驟之後，能在探索的進程中個别學習，而獲得學習的興趣。</p>
<p>（三）使兒童各自發揚其天賦的才能，在團體中作有貢獻的活動，而其學習的動機，純粹出於自我的要求。</p>
<p>實施個别教學法的歩驟簡述如下：</p>
<p>（一）編訂個别作業概要；</p>
<p>（二）指導個别作業方法；</p>
<p>（三）參照各科教學實例，另訂個别學習歷程；</p>
<p>（四）規定課外作業；</p>
<p>（五）充分供給閲讀及參考材料；</p>
<p>（六）編訂個别攷查材料，予以精密攷查。</p>
<p>（二）問題教學法：三四年級試行問題教學法的目的是在：</p>
<p>（一）使兒童在生活環境中選擇合於他們心理上，生理上所必需的材料，進行有目的，有計劃，自己實行，自己判斷的活動，俾兒童的經騐與自我可不斷的改組與生長。</p>
<p>（二）使兒童在日常生活中自行提出問題，計劃方法，搜集材料，自求解决，以謀中小學的溝通。</p>
<p>（三）整個教學法：一二年級試行整個教學法，是在打破以往一切論理的科目組織，改用工作單元爲做學教的單位，使兒童在生活環境中選擇合於他們能力的與需要的材料，進行有組織，有系統，自行計劃，實行判斷而獲得解决日常生活問題的方法。教師可隨時隨地觀察兒童個性的需要，予以有效的指導。該校編有工作單元實騐方案，一方作爲指導做學教進程的參考，一方分析歸納預定的學習結果，以作實騐後的參證。</p>

<p>體育消息</p>
<h3>國際籃球前哨戰暨南信通今晚會師申園</h3>
<p>六時半起雙方俱以最佳陣綫出塲</p>
<p>鐵城盃錦標暨南大學籃球隊、今爲國際籃球賽中華隊之基本隊伍、前在西青籃球聯賽中、不幸敗於信通、失去冠軍希望、心有未甘、該隊乘南征常勝餘威、特約西青歷年錦標信通隊（即前之海賊）、定今晚六時半在申園作友誼比賽、門票國幣五角、雙方俱以最優陣綫應戰、職位如下、</p>
<p>位置　暨南　　信通</p>
<p>右鋒　尹貴仁　史規亞</p>
<p>左鋒　韓振元　拉姆金</p>
<p>中鋒　鄺耀雅　蘭　茵</p>
<p>右衛　蔡演雄　披合司</p>
<p>左衛　王南珍　卡　遜</p>
<p>裁判　張國勛　瞿錫麟</p>
<p>西青聯賽、暨南敗於信通、因西青爲信通之熟地、無往而不利、以前海賊能連年稱覇者、原因在此、一至中華籃球房、（不訥前之勞神父路或今之申園）海賊鋒芒收歛、庸碌如常、今年上海會中、信通自知將非麥令辛隊等敵、草草從事、虚應塲面而已、同時暨南亦未參加、以致今年公認之上海兩强隊、未得易地相遇機會、是以今晚之戰、雖非錦標性質、實爲極有意義之賽、而饜球迷之渴望也、</p>
<p>再者、萬國籃球賽、將於月初舉行、歷年錦標之爭、不出中美兩國、而中華一再失敗焉、本屆兩隊之基本隊、一即信通、一爲暨南是以今晚之戰、猶不啻爲國際賽之前哨戰、觀此之勝負、不難預測今年中美兩國在國際賽之形勢矣</p>

<p>關於足球賽之雙球　制問題、近日英國足球界迭有討論、惟各足球會多不表贊同、如著名之哈科厦足球會最近舉行會議、當提出此問題時、出席者一致表示反對、並訓令全省之足球代表凡遇有此項之提議、均須加以反對、據彼等意見、以爲足球賽之所以迭有糾紛、乃因球證能力之不及、而非制度之不良、蓋現時之制度、實無可疵議者、若繆然更改、則不惟不見糾紛之减少、抑且反見增加、至謂只限於職業比賽、採用此制、則亦説不去、蓋同是足球、不能分爲兩種比賽條例、且若職業球賽採行、久而久之、餘賽亦難免因而改易其制度云、</p>

<h3>日人近著蔣委員長傳記</h3>
<p>敘述我國領袖之偉大　己由汗血社譯成中文</p>
<p>中央社云，日人石丸藤太近著“蔣介石”一書，由東東春秋社出版，該書為傳記體裁，以外國人之眼光，叔述我國領袖之偉大，風格識見，皆具新穎，擭集材料，亦甚豐富。現經上海汗血社譯出，由汗血書店出版發行，因原著者序文中稱有“蔣介石偉大”一語，討譯者卽以此語名書，定於三月二十左右出書，全書十餘萬言，現已發售預約。兹將該書原序附詰如后：</p>
<p>序文蔣介石偉大！這是這幾年來我的結論。</p>
<p>而日本却沒有他的正確傳記，間或有的，則是些不率確以及片斷的東西。我决心想寫他的傳記，不斷的蒐集中日兩國與他有關係的資料。</p>
<p>傳記㊁</p>
<p>忽然前次的中日交涉發生，春秋社主神田豐穗氏於是殷動動勗將他的傳記從速完成，而在我執筆寫成約三分之二的時候，又有西安事件遽起。</p>
<p>蔣介石果然集世界之視聽，在中國的人望已逐漸愈加增高。</p>
<p>西安事件發生的前些時候，當我正在寫蔣介石傳時，有某高官拍着我的肩設：</p>
<p>“現在時候來稱派蔣介石，你不是已經被南京政府牧買了的嗎”？蔣氏被日本人誤解，是已至如此之甚。</p>
<p>所謂“蔣介石不足異，彼之對日乃偽裝”之見解，我未必反對，但是同時，“日本友乎？敵乎？”之作者徐道隣氏説過的：</p>
<p>“日本外交時報在看袁世剴與李鴻章的同一標準上看蔣介石，而像是不知時世變動的事。日本人很是認識不足，這亦認識不足之一。”我認為亦有可深味的地方。</p>
<p>傳記㊂</p>
<p>我想與其劈頭加以非難，謂“蔣介石不足異”，自不如激勵中華民國國民説：“努力吧，向上吧！”同時並進行中日親善。這是大國日本的胸襟，亦是為着東洋的和平。</p>
<p>由那樣的意義，所以我認為，將中華民國的統治者蔣介石氏，脫除一切誤解索縛以及感情論，赤裸裸寫出，極為心要。</p>
<p>立在此種見地，作為人物來將他觀看時，我不期然而不得不感嘆：</p>
<p>“蔣介石偉大”！</p>
<p>請看他的氣骨與手腕，處那種痛苦立塲，由外國多方而的壓迫中終於已將所謂不可能的中國的統一，逐漸完成！不是眞正可以瞻仰的人物嗎？西安事件斷不能顚覆他在中國的地位·他依然是中國的救世主，是崇拜的目標。</p>
<p>傳記㊃</p>
<p>吾等日本人，現在不是有將他所統率的新中國，另眼相看的心要嗎？</p>
<p>為着變更對新中國的觀念，吾等不僅須知主要工作者的蔣介石其人，而返顧由彼統率之中國與日本，此數年來有何所作何所為，亦極必要。著者本書中群述滿洲事變以來以蔣介石為中心之中日關係者，乃係基於此種理由：而昭和十一年（中華民國二十五年）中日交涉失敗的原因，恐亦可在此中發見。</p>
<p>本書是在這樣之旨趣下寫的。</p>
<p>當本書之執筆，我曾力求遍觀在日本之文獻，以及中國方面之文獻。關於此點，在我東京朝日新聞曾工作十數年間之賴富貴氏，為著者之故所供給之中國方面貴重之資科，深甚感謝。</p>
<p>傳記㊄</p>
<p>同時，著者亦曾力謀在時間許可的範圍內，傾聽日本朝野著名人氏對於蔣介石氏無忌憚之批評。在此不能將大名一一揭示，殊為遺憾。</p>
<p>本書之成，乃以上諸氏之賜，唯著者淺學所寫只僅是單方面，謹乞原有。</p>
<p>昭和十一年十二月二十五日正讀蔣介石安然回京之電報。著者議。</p>

<h3>改淮村容野容之研究</h3>
<p>— 鈕永建</p>
<p>在俞塘民衆敎育館講</p>
<p>吾人欲使全地方造成一天然大公園，其要訣在改進村容野容，因村野為地方之最大部分，且甚天然好景實無不為村野所專有，而村野之區域，廣大淸潔，易於整理，又不若都市之湫溢污穢，不易着手也。今略貢研究之意見如左：</p>
<p>吾人試一遊租借地，見其市鄉種種、經營，莫不壯麗優美，僅此外表上之觀瞻，已足起人欽羨，由欽羨血不覺折服，此於對外交涉上每發生甚大之影響，然此種優美之現象，試一遊世界各國：幾無不如是：卽亞洲新造之日本及各國殖民地之現象：亦無不如是：且較之上海租借地當有過之無不及。而返顧吾、所屆之村野都市，無不卑污陋劣，相形之下，於是幾目疑我人不及外人種性之優良，廢然待亡，其腦筋簡單者，且有願為外人服役，或願為外國隷屬，或更剏為奇謬之説，以為欲改良中國，必須歡迎外人入主中國，百年然後可，此吾人在革命初期，常聽之議論也，卽可知外表之優美，實於人類之競爭上有重大之意味矣。然試一分析世界各地方優美之點則不外乎利便精當，堅實，偉大，嚴整，清潔，衛生，美觀各點。再就以上各優點分析之，偉大緊實，根科財力；精當利便，根乎學術；是固非一步可成，但在今日上海廣州漢口等處，吾國人亦已多有能企及之矣。至於嚴整，淸潔，衛生，美觀，則不盡乎財力，亦不盡須高深之學術，只在吾人心理上之志願及身體上之勤勉卽可辦到。</p>
<p>吾人於短時期內，不能辦到之財力及學問，自當別籌方法，以漸致之，只要尋着門徑，做些耐苦工夫，數年數十年後，亦並無不可能之事。至若心理上身體上之事，如嚴整，淸潔，衛生，美觀者，則吾人固可立刻進行，且可短時期內，加以改善，使目前地方景物，表示一種優美程度，固非難事也。</p>
<p>此改善地方外表上才優美，在都市謂之市容，在鄉村謂之鄉容，積全國之市容鄉容，卽為國容；國容之優劣，國家之榮辱繫焉：優者起人尊敬，劣者招人侮辱，甚豕招壓迫滅亡之禍，誠非細事也，依世界陽新學説，在二三十年前，有某英人首創田園都市的計劃，此乃以鄉容改良部市。蓋以都市人烟稠密，經濟壓迫，衛生及生活上太不良好，釀成種種弊風，無論貧富，均感覺其不適，於是市中之富豪有力者。首先遷居鄉野，以避其器，中人以下及貧乏者，當然無此機會，於是社會學者，倡為田園都市之説，謀都市之根本改造，卽欲以鄉野之利益，普及於都市，此種學説，倡自英國初由二富豪有志者試辦，不數年間，各國聞風而起，現已徧及全球，凡新剏之都市，無不為此説所支配，絕無再向都市謀都市之發展者，如上海市之中心區，今遷於引翔鄉，卽此例也。雖然，此僅為都市計，而並未為全國最大多數之鄉村計，殆非造成全地公園之根本辦法也。</p>
<p>於是有反其説而行之者，卽鄉村都市化之説是也，此説發生於上説之前，卽在十九世紀中葉，都市利用科學大發展之後，而在一千八百七十八年間為尤盛，其在鄉村為種種之設備，固屬甚佳，其短處卽在以鄉村不相宜之都市建設移於鄉村，如工廠，跳舞塲，跑馬塲，夜花園等，此固非鄉村之所需要，不過以鄉村供都市之犧牲，至鄉村應有之設備，反淡忘之，如衛生機關，指導機關，農業上之生產及合作機關，農村糾織，農村娛樂等等，一切不問，故都市愈發達，鄉村卽愈衰洛。一般社會景象之不安，卽由於此，所以為學者及政治家所不取也。</p>
<p>其貫鄉村必要之設備，在物質方面及指導方面概括言之，一為生訐的，一為衛生的，一為利用的：而娛樂之設備，亦應有上三項之意義，以上各項，其與都市同者甚多，亦有鄉村應有，而為都市所不必具　，亦有都市所應有，而鄉付所不必備也。</p>
<p>今日之論題，並非在設備方面，故設備事件，姑舍不論，現在鄉村有輕而易舉之事業，亦有生計的衛生，的，利用的及娛樂的關係，卽前文所謂鄉容是也。</p>
<p>鄉村本富於美觀的山林，水竹，草地，農田等天然風景。都市倘能得具一端，已為勝地，在鄉村則此種風景，到處皆是，加以空氣淸新，陽光充足，以耕以牧，以漁以獵，登山臨水，盤馬放舟，無一非天然妙趣，至若春郊散步，花島宜人，夏日避署，水木明瑟，秋水紅葉之豔，冬原積霉之明，偶一領略，均可衛生，星期息遊，卽是體育，倘我人在此新興國，利用甚江海湖河之勝，五岳長城之奇，仿瑞士及日本之布置整理，則美景幾不可勝舉，他如北境之萬里中原，四疆之千重畯嶺，閩粵長春之地，滿蒙積雪之天，無一不冠絕塵賓，超絕世界，固非歐美各國所可及，卽在此上海大都市之近旁，而利用天然之勝景，溫和之氣候使各區各鄉所有地方天然物，人造物，無不整理得宜，成為全部天然好景，則中外名流，都市民衆，必目趨之恐後，以為天堂樂園，此則無異為特別市三百萬人民預備一臨時大別墅，而為其不費錢，不費勞方精神之享用地，諸君試一冥想，果能做到此境，彼時地方之景象伺如！羣衆之興趣如何！殆决非今日枯燥零落可比，倘我人再定各種規則，限制不合理之侵擾，增加較高尚之娛樂，則我人必可坐享內地及都布兩方不能得之利益，此吾人所宜覺悟者也。</p>
<p>鄉容係鄉村美觀的籠統名詞，今分析言之，可為村容野容兩類，村為居住地之村落，野為不居住之田野，二者須各有適宜之整理，方顯優美。</p>
<p>吾人就今日之經濟狀况，不欲侈言設備，多與建築，僅欲從輕而易舉者辦起，卽應由淸潔，整齊，衛生，美觀入手，然徒依經濟之發展，興趣之提高，逐漸進而求利便，正確，堅固，偉大詩優點，發揮鄉村固　之特色，以完整其鄉容。</p>
<p>至淸潔，整齊，美觀，衛生四事，亦應分別緩急先後，次第進行，先就村容言之，村容之改善，比野容尤為急要，蓋野容有天然之景物，縱未加以人工，亦不致不堪入目，卽有不美觀處，亦不致使人厭惡，惟居住地不整理，則汗穢雜亂，最足證明吾人文化之衰落，人種之劣下，此吾人亟宜媿奮努力者也，况遊觀之美，必依居住地為據點，如茶亭，酒排，食店，乳館，球塲，操地，閱覽室，音樂亭，照相館，土產陳列所，其他名勝古蹟，憇息地，駐足點等等，無不在居住地之近傍，故若村容不先整埋，將使遊人無駐足之地，雖有天然好景，亦不能招徠遊客，反之若人人注意村容，則田野間之村落，本有天然好景在其四周，最易造成佳勝之地，於是野景藉村落之優麗，以集遊客之行蹤，卽無異村落借野景之優美，而享漁翁之溢利，此又吾人亟宜覺悟者也。（未完）</p>

<h3>怎樣應付環境</h3>
<p>— 林韻</p>
<p>在資本主義制度的社會之下，婦女的地位，雖然是比較前此時代，是增高了不少，但是我們不抛開現實生活，不離開實際地説，婦女的現實環境，尤其是在封建遺毒還没完全肅淸的中國社會，婦女們在客觀的地位上看，而遭受着外來環境的壓廹，以及在異性們的眼光底下，所被評估的價值仍然是伏守於水凖的下面的。這種現象之發生原由，當然，一方面固然是爲了資本主義的社會制度的澎漲及封建遺毒的作祟，一方面我們站在極客觀的地位上，也不能不向婦女們本身的陣綫上，加以很精密的檢討。</p>
<p>當然，外來的惡劣勢力的襲擊，是使婦女們的前途，會遭受到阻碍，不過，澈底地説，婦女們之應當注視到怎樣去訓練一種力量，來和這種惡勢力奮鬥和抵抗，甚而應當説是剷除，却也是一件更堪注意的事。</p>
<p>社會，本來是一個極複雜的箱子。在社會的週遭，是雜佈着各式各樣的惡劣潛勢力的。我們站在這箱子當中，應當怎樣來應付這極複雜的週遭呢？應當怎樣來應付這惡劣的環境，而不使婦女們的地位，遭受到這環境的壓廹呢？</p>
<p>所以，怎樣應付環境，應當也是婦女們切身的一件事，尤其是在這非常時期的當中。</p>
<p>怎樣應付環境的至低條件，應當先具有下面這幾點；（一）訓練冷静的思想。（二）多過集團生活。（三）處處要留心到現實生活。（四）應當使自己的生活嚴肅。（五）應當要增加婦女團體組織的力量。（六）要養成有互助的精神。</p>
<p>自己能够把思想訓練得冷静了起來，那就是説遇事不至於發生應付的困難。而且在冷静的視察之下，也可以使我們知道這件事的發生與未來，能够認淸了一件事的始末，當然便不至於受着這件事的打擊或節制了。多過集團生活，那是使我們多認識大衆的力量和精神；從大衆的力量和精神上，可以看出人類的可愛，同時更可以發現人與人中間的隔膜，推而廣之，也可以知道社會裏無人的隔膜；因爲社會就是集團的擴大。過慣了集團生活，應付社會，便不至於那麽恐慌了。留心現實生活，那是使自己的思想行動，不至於超出現實，而造成幻想的美夢；也不至於没有進歩，而落在時代的後面，嚴肅自己生活，可以使自己對於任何細微的事，養成不苟且的精神。從嚴肅的生活當中，更可以使自己發生一種前進的力量。至於增加婦女團體組織的力量無異地就是替個人增加力量，因爲團體和個人，永遠是不會分開的。要養成有互助的精神，當然，這是積極地在消滅婦女們不慣大事—這是大衆的事—的惡習慣，因爲人類必需互助，才會發生相當的力量，尤其是婦女們，在現實環境底下，更應當特别注意到這一點。</p>
<p>能够應付環境，然後才能在環境裏面，創造了我們的事業，所以是在前進戰綫上的婦女們，大家更應當注意到怎樣應付你們的環境。</p>
<h3>我國婦女應該多多的經營家庭副業</h3>
<p>— 亞生</p>
<p>失業，在中國人當中，簡直是難以計數的；我們如果要按家逐户的去調查一過，無論那一家人家，在全家的人口裏面，總只有那極少數的人。是有正當職業的，有許多人家，甚至於全家多少口，都是在靠賴著别人過活，所以窮這一個字，簡直好像弄得我國人民的普遍現象！</p>
<p>但是，就一般的情形而論，那些失業的男子，如果不是由於自己的名譽過分惡劣，只要肯辛辛苦苦的在職務上去努力，不在什麽地位身分上苛求，也很容易找一個事情做做，至於談到婦女呢，那就不大來得容易，而且那些出了嫁以後的女子，爲了有孩子的牽累，更加不容你再到外面去做什麽職業活動，這實在是婦女本身和家庭經濟方面一個極嚴重的問題，倘若大部分的婦女都能經營着適當的職業活動，不但家庭經濟可以得到很大的幫助，而且婦女的地位，也自然就可以於無形中提起來的。</p>
<p>不過，社會上的職業地位既然已不容易求到，家庭當中的責任又不容婦女們抛棄，婦女們也大可不必定要硬頭皮去到社會上去找出路，像經營家庭副業，也未嘗不是婦女作職業活動的一個正當途徑，而且婦女們的經營家庭副業，除了能一樣的處理家務而外，又能少掉許多無謂的束縛和限制，到忙的時候，全家的人，又都可以動手幫忙，既自由而又快樂，不是比經營别種職業要有趣得多嗎？</p>
<p>現在我再將比較容易經營的家庭副業，分類的叙述如下，讀者如果有志於此，那麽就根據你們的興趣和環境需要，快快的着手努力吧！</p>

<h3>入春後的家庭園藝</h3>
<p>— 曹義璇</p>
<p>現在立春的季節已過，正爲一年中家庭園藝凖備的時期。因爲草木經過深眠的季節，花園中的工作，漸漸的忙碌起來了。二月起的主要工作，爲管理保護秋播的草花球根類，分離宿根草花類，整理花壇，收拾草地以及修剪薔薇與接木等。對於花壇，苗床，防霜的枯草等，應當仔細整理，適當的除草，加肥，灌水，使苗發育健全，在花園的曠地，應充分的深耕，先把土壤消毒，再把堆肥，草木灰，過燐酸，石灰，糠豆粕，骨粉等，配合適當，耡入土中，（不可粗率，以免凍結風化，）昨秋採取的種子，除去雜物與不良種子，嚴密選擇，確立栽培計畫，製作栽培預定表，記明本年應栽植的種類，數量，地位，種苗的有無，與所需的土壤肥料等。器具中有不完全者，趕速修理。如有宿根草花類，在本月中旬分出，栽植於花盆或花壇中。其他花木，亦可漸次移植，輪栽，如栽植於花壇的灌木類的黄楊，盆松，盆杉，沈丁花，杜鵑等，在二月下旬起移植，去年所生的薔薇枝，殘留三分之一，其餘多須剪去，落葉花土類的修剪，接木插木，駁枝等，亦自二月下旬起開始。草地普通每年刈剪二三次，在二月內應加修刈一次，或在草上加上肥活的土六七分，那末，到了春夏之交，就很綿密茂盛了。因爲草地的芝草，其根很淺，如過了二三年，其根都沿於地表一二寸之間，没有發育的餘地，同時因爲雜草蔓延，芝必自然消滅。不過芟除雜草，須要耐心，應在本月上旬分刈，若到了本月下旬，要開花結實，更加不易整理了。温室，在温室內栽培的花木，須調節温度，大抵冷室，夜間爲四十度，晝間七十度，而且要留心窗的開閉，加熱灌水，施肥等。因爲這月內的保温，最費苦心的。播種，如球根類的秋海棠（Begonia）洋漏斗花（Gloxinia）洋紫紅花（Achimenes）等，在下旬下種，他如紫羅蘭（Stocks）釣鐘草（Lobelia）菊（Aster）南非綉球花（Menasia）等一二年生草花類，播種於平的花盆中。插木，佳納熏花（Carnation）印度雁來紅（Colilus）南非天竺葵，（Geranium）黑西哥海棠類薔薇等，從二月上旬已可接木。大凡開花後的腋芽或側芽，以及薔薇等徒長無用的枝，二月爲最好木插的季節。至於保護管理，尤宜注意，天晴的早晨，寒風厲霜，應當把所蓋的草薦除去，曝以太陽，上層的草薦，如受了霜露的濕，當日曬干，過午後三時，再蓋上草薦，以備夜寒。有風的日子，要防乾燥，經過雨雪後，又要防凍結，花將開時，多灌以水，花盛開時，禁止注水。採種，如五色加那里菊（Cineraria）洋玉簪（Cylamur）櫻草（Drimrose）等，預備採種用的，須搬入中温室，停止灌水。每日上午十時用人工媒介法即用毛筆沾雄花至雌花，促其早結子，結子完全，再移到低温室，直待種子完熟採下。</p>
<h3>塗脂抹粉掩盡天真</h3>
<h3>泡菜的簡單製法</h3>
<p>— 張王静華</p>
<p>四川的泡菜是最有名的，在四川製時，有特製泡菜的罈子，但是以我之經騐所得，也並不一定要這罈子，尤其是有些常常出門的家庭裏，更用不到這泡菜罈子的。</p>
<p>説起他的製法來，也十分便當。在冬天，黄芽菜（又稱膠東菜）又肥又嫩，把他切成碎塊，（不可過小約半寸見方）一面先將開水加鹽煮沸，盛入缽中，（或乾净的酒罈也好）待冷透後，再將切就的黄芽菜和整個的辣椒投入，再放些香料，如茴香花椒之類在內，並加些黄酒，罈口上用蓋蓋好，只要不使灰塵侵入，即使透氣，也不要緊，如此者過六七日，便可以佐餐了。需要時把筷子在鹽水中撈出，仍復蓋好，這便是很有味的泡菜，待第一次菜盡時，再加入黄芽菜，如此輪流着泡用，那鹽水可以用三四次，非常經濟。</p>
<p>我每年冬天必做泡菜，以之貽贈親友，大家讚不絶口，其實製法是很簡單的，請者不妨如法泡製，定必别有風味。</p>

<h3>第五信</h3>
<p>B女士：</p>
<p>尊函述令親在黄山購得一地，擬造别墅；但除去房屋所占之地外，預備造庭園的部分，覺得有三天缺點，令親頗不合意。即不方正，不平坦，不寛大，所以令親託你與我商量，可有什麽方法補救？</p>
<p>女士！請你轉達令親罷！令親所認作三個大缺點的，從我們造園上看來，非但不是缺點，而且還有利益。所以令親現在雖然很懊喪，以爲購得了一塊無用之地，你告訴他：我還打算向他道喜咧。</p>
<p>第一，照圖上看，那一塊地本是多角形的，除去了房屋，形狀當然更不整齊；但是要曉得；造庭園，不是吃四喜肉，何以必定要方方正正的大塊呢？我們極端的説：「造園」實在最忌方正。如果造歐美式那種圖案的庭園，那末，方正的土地，或者還可以將就；然而也總覺得太呆板了。至於不是那種整形庭園，凡那些正方形或長方形的土地，造園上都不相宜。最大的原因，就是因爲太没有變化，太没有曲折了。園的構造，第一要使游客身入其中，看不出這園有多大？倘使開門見山，一目了然，那就没有趣味。地面不方正，是天然的變化，天然的曲折，再好没有了，所以我們萬一購得了方正的土地，爲着園林要有變化曲折，也只得把房屋造得使餘地成爲不方正。</p>
<p>第二，不平坦，這在經濟上，非常便宜。園的佈置，大約可分爲兩種：一種是平面的，工程簡單，造價很廉。還有一種，就是高低不平的，高的，是築起來的山（即土墩而加以石塊裝飾者），低的，就是池。這外觀上却有變化；但是工程不大，一面要堆山，一面要掘池，既費金錢，又費時間，如果這塊造園的空地上，本來七高八低，那就大可利用了。設計時，應當先看了地勢的高低，拿來點綴。高的地方，就此築山，低的所在，就此掘池，這樣的幹，費用不大，時間又省，這實實在在可以使令親省許多錢。但是若然另外打打圖樣，一定要用在這地面上，不去利用牠的不平坦，那就非但得不到便宜，而且還有大大損失，説不定會在高處掘池，低處築山，變成兩倍工程咧。</p>
<p>第三，園地太小，當然是個缺點；但在令親現在的情形，倒不要緊，也可以省錢。令親的地，在山坡上，不要説地面太小，就是一尺餘地没有，也仍舊可以得到一個極好的園。因爲從室內眺望出來，可以看到極遠的景色。這園外一所天然公園似的地方，雖然不是令親所有，令親實有享受牠的權利。這在我們造園上，叫做借景園，凡在山上湖邊等處，只要旁邊有好的影緻，就可以設法借光。這時候，自己的園地，即使小一點，也不成問題了。</p>
<p>所以你快些給一個喜信與令親，叫他不要掃興，還是立刻動工罷。（卓呆）</p>

<h3>爲錢忙</h3>
<p>— 秦嘉</p>
<p>在二十天以前，秋生委實急得連氣都喘不過來。去年雖説是年成好，但好也好不到他，麥漲價，秋生偏不曾種麥；米呢，市價好像不曾跌過，但鄉下那些米行的老板實在太精明了，口口聲聲説熟年，銷路呆，每擔至多出個四塊五塊，不高興時，三塊錢也不要。因此秋生在年底時，仍和每年一樣，不得不害一次『年關病』。他知道南貨店的賬是賴不掉的，醬園的賬也非還不可；而有一筆三分錢利息的借欵，至少也得在年三十夜把二十七塊的利息送去，不然賈三老爺是不饒人的。</p>
<p>秋生有個堂房姊姊，呌雪蘭，嫁在上海，每年年下，倒還有周濟他一二十塊錢，大致二十五六裏總會寄到；不料去年忽然起了變化，候到年二十八還不見音信，秋生這可急壞了，跟老婆一商量，只得硬着頭皮，自己找到上海來。</p>
<p>雪蘭的男人是位大律師，應酬是怪忙的，秋生走進他家大門的時後，他們夫婦倆正從外面回來，雪蘭一面和她弟弟招呼，一面把身上那一件毛茸茸，亮油油的皮大衣缷下來望衣架上一套。這一件皮大衣實在是太好了，不曾見過世面的秋生忍不住便把兩個烏子覷定着它儘是發呆。雪蘭看看好笑，便問他：『你懂這些灰背好不好？』秋生忙着點點頭，其實他根本也不懂什麽是灰背。</p>
<p>『二姊？這件大衣要幾塊錢才能買』？秋生問。</p>
<p>『這一件也不是頂好的，我買三百八十塊錢』。雪蘭很輕描淡寫地説。</p>
<p>三百八十塊！這真是秋生做夢也不曾想到的，他想上半年三老爺嫁女，兩箱皮衣買了三百塊錢，大家聽得已經羡慕煞，現在他的堂姊單是一件大衣，就要三百八十塊，真是那兒來的事。</p>
<p>『這還是前兩天新買的，因爲要過年了。』雪蘭又説着。</p>
<p>這樣越發使秋生感覺詫異了。年關是大家要過的，窮人逢到年關，要想法子弄三塊錢都不容易，有錢的人竟舍化三百八十塊錢買一件衣裳！秋生想窮人真是太起碼了！</p>
<p>吃飯的時候秋生老着臉開口了，雪蘭倒也不拒絶，答應借他三十塊錢，午後還帶他出去到大馬路辦些年貨。秋生到那些店裏一瞧，險些就要嚇死了，只見每一處全擠滿着人，拚命的䛬出許多鈔票來，競買一切高價的東西，這情形真像搶一樣。</p>
<p>秋生不由暗暗嘆道：</p>
<p>『窮人到年關是只怕没有錢用，富人到年關却只怕有了錢没處用！窮人跟宫人到底差了些什麽呢！』</p>
<h3>「讀夫婦之道」有感</h3>
<p>— 蔡莫懷珠</p>
<p>最近訪蔡聲白夫人莫懷珠女士於其邸第，請其發表對於賢妻良母與家庭問題之意見，莫女士甚提倡賢妻良母主義，並以新病初瘥，未能多多闡發，因出最近病中所作「讀夫婦之道有感」一文，情真語摯，完全自天性中流露，而慈孝友愛之精神，更充塞於字裏行間，因爲發表如次：（記者誌）</p>
<p>閒居瀏覽小説雜誌，得機聯會出版之「夫婦之道」，展卷讀之，心有所感；蓋文字生動，叙事明瞭，可作青年夫婦之南針，可增壯年夫婦之情愛，莊諧並陳，與黄君寄萍所著「現代夫婦」堪相伯仲。書中所述女子，均以賢妻良母爲多，堪資模楷。近來摩登女子，輒譏賢妻良母爲男子之寄生蟲，詎知家齊而後國治，於古已有明訓，而蔣委員長之新生活運動，亦復注重禮義廉恥，故余以爲今之女子，尤當勉爲賢妻良母者也。惜余凉德，淺學，能否實踐，深自惕勵者耳。病中翻閲二十年來日記，彌感韶光之易逝，來軫之方道，爰將日記中可資紀念者，摘述一二，願以自箴，並爲諸姑姊妹作一談助。</p>
<p>余籍浙之吳興，生於公曆一九○○年，家君任營絲業，雖非富有，堪稱小康，我母生我姊妹三人及一弟，余居長，故父母愛之甚。襁褓以迄成人，䑛犢之愛，無時或替，顧余略識之無，喜閲哀情小説，浸沈所及，遂移情性，以爲古人爲文，窮而益工，我人讀書，愈哀愈易動情。小説戲曲，何獨不然。習性所移，輒䧟悲觀，而所悲觀者，又不自知悲之所自，殆所謂無病而呻吟者歟！我父以我身體虧弱，由於神經衰弱之故，力誡之，我乃漸漸達觀，民九適同邑蔡君，蔡氏爲吳興望族，世簪纓，淸貧自給，我嫁時翁已捐館，慈姑猶在堂，外子則留學方歸，婚後光陰，甜蜜無比，惟初婚之時，因鄉土習慣之不同，與姑分居兩載，我父嚴誡，晨昏必須定省，方合婦道，乃復迎養，於是日沐慈靄，成一美滿之家庭。民十六，邁姑仙逝，余等服闋盡孝，嗣外子所治事業，日趨發達，夫婦間情愛益增純篤，且相敬如賓，婚後十六年來，咸無疾言厲色，與黄君所著現代夫婦，堪相嫓美。今翁姑雖逝世多年，而我等已子女成行。且余椿萱並茂，天賜我福，不謂不厚矣。惟我父年已花甲，息影娱老，我弟長於優厚，未識憂患，是以父業悉委外子經理，休戚相關，翁婿儼同父子，能如此者，一則仁愛，一則誠敬而已。余識之，故余夫婦之能保持情愛彌久自篤者，亦惟誠敬而已。余初育女兒六，一子早殤，心常鬱鬱，外子輒多方慰藉，去年又獲一雄，伉儷益快樂逾恒，詎於今春，余病傷寒，臥牀閲月，方獲痊愈，神經忽又失常，竟至不省人事，自朝至暮，蓬首垢面，非復人形，不言不語，如痴如醉，有時且哭泣無端，心不自主。雙親爲余憂慮，外子爲余看護，延醫服藥，歷時半載，親戚友朋，都蒙垂注，幸耶誕節後，漸次復原，今尚在調理中，握管至此，幾訝隔世。病之來如有鬼擾，病之去又如神佑，抑先翁姑在天之靈，有以佑其兒媳耶！余既自視爲更甦，此後當力求快樂，人生百年，爲歡幾何；人之誕世，如登舞臺；既上舞臺，當盡我心力躋於名角，豈僅充跑龍套以自塞責也哉。當我劇病之時，外界或有物議，惟余伉儷愛情，則有增無减，可見精誠所至，金石爲開，西諺云：結婚者愛情之墳墓，余獨謂其不然，方今婚姻自由，雙方愛情達至沸點，方結成夫婦，患難相扶，疾病相助，以求永不相離，倘如西諺所謂，則何必多此一舉。余又謂人生百年，肉體難逃墳墓，愛情當留天地，雖歷萬古而必不磨滅者也。病愈恬適，狂詞忘形，明達之士，儻不嗤其河漢歟。</p>

<h3>“叩響頭”</h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>剛在報上看到過墨西哥的“進步鬥牛塲”因為觀衆看不到雄牛與猛獅搏鬥，因而羣情憤激，將該鬥牛塲付之一炬的新聞，想不到無獨有偶，在中國的南京，也有近似的事情發生。</p>
<p>據某報二十三日南京專電云：“四十年代劇社，二十二日晚於國民大戲院演‘賽金花’演至賽向瓦德西叩響頭時，觀衆認為侮辱中華民族過甚，紛以果皮痰盂茶壺向臺上投擲，秩序大亂．該劇社允將劇本修正後再上演。”</p>
<p>“賽金花”是否“侮辱中華民族過甚”呢，“賽金花”在“文學”上發表的時候無人提起；在上海公演的時候無人提起：在南京公演的前幾天也無人提起；可見“侮辱”之説，是不大可靠，至少是並不每個觀衆都以為盡然的。並且，若説果眞有“侮辱中華民族”之處，劇本審查會就決計不會予以通過，現在連該“叩響頭”之處都未刪除，可見“侮辱”之説，在政府當局也並不以為然的。</p>
<p>“賽金花”一劇，原是以庚子事變為背景的帶有史實性的諷喻劇，劇本中所寫的“叩響頭”，（據我所知，向瓦德西叩響頭的是一個在天津洋務總局做帮辦的小官員，並不是賽金花。）原是對“叩頭外交”的諷刺。在“賽金花”中的口喊“奴才祇會叩頭，跟洋大人叩頭”者，則是身穿朝服，頭戴翖帽的滿清官員，照理如果對清朝並無特別好感，或者想掩飾亡清官僚的昏庸糊塗，懊會的發生應該是絕少的可能的。</p>
<p>然而現在則“觀衆認為侮辱中華民族過甚，紛以果皮痰盂茶壺向臺上投擲”，這就不能不使人奇怪！而且，這不幸事件的發生，不在“賽金花”上演的第一天，而在已經演了幾天之後，這就使人更奇怪。</p>
<p>或者説，所以引起這樣“秩序大亂”的不幸事件者，或者是由於戲演得太馬虎，不夠表達出劇本的原意，而那一天觀衆的欣賞水準恰巧又低，以致在熱情衝動下，像“樵夫砍曹操”似的原為對“叩頭外交”不滿者，結果卻發洩到戲身上來，如果是這樣，遺憾雖然遺憾，但還可以見到一些未死的民心，民族前途，究竟還大可樂觀。惟所怕者，“認侮辱中華民族過甚”祇是一頂帽子，而認為諷刺過甚，而硬拉到自己頭上來。</p>
<p>如是這樣，那麼我想痛哭之外，不想再説別的話了。</p>
<h3>途中</h3>
<p>— 黃葉</p>
<p>——從歸綏到武川</p>
<p>早晨七點鐘，東邊天剛剛發白，聽見車夫呌門的聲音，岱和我趕忙爬起身來。穿上光板老羊皮襖，腰里捆上顆搭腰帶，一頂山羊皮的成吉思汗式帽子，白鷄冠似的毛叢叢地戴在腦袋上，腳套着一雙白毡矮筒的靴。</p>
<p>一輛兩匹馬拉着的轎車停在門外，馬瘦的露着肋巴骨，不耐煩的踢動着蹄子，累墮的草包肚囊，一抽一搐地不停的喘，車夫按着駕轅馬的轡頭，讓我們坐進軍里去，兩個人的身子便把車塞滿了。我斜依在岱的身上動都不能動，車夫把鞭子在馬頭上響了一下，兩匹馬同時向上伸了伸脖脛，邁開抖動的腿，開始在寂靜的荒路上，葛登登，萬登登地響起來。</p>
<p>車折出河城，先爬上一股土路，錯綜的車轍，經水泥凝凍得非常結實，一條條非常整齊，間或有被馬踢壞了的缺口，正像無數把缺了口的刀在地上扔着，縐緊緊的泥皮上，浮了許多水的花紋，走不上十里路，看見了烈土公園，長城抗敵死難烈士紀念碑孤高的聳立着，碑後面，是幾十具新從前綫運回來的陣亡戰士，黃白色的棺木後邊，有幾百座新搭起來的土丘，整齊的像他們生時站在國境的崗位上；荷槍實彈的凝視着敵人一樣。我默然的感到一陣心酸，想到他們悲壯的犧牲，跟那準備繼續流血的水雪中的弟兄，這個陷入危運中的古老民族，只有他們才是保衛人民的眞英雄！我含了淚扭過臉來，幾株擺動的樹梢掠過車旁，車隨着走上了一條多石的稍微傾斜的山路。</p>
<p>大青山橫互在前面，山勢不高，但崎嶇得很，隨地都是砂石，車就搖擺得更厲害了。岱和我的頭時常碰在一起，彼此看看，無可奈何的苦笑著。忍耐着在車上又坐了二十幾里路，在蜈蚣壩口打尖，錶的指針是十二點半了。</p>
<p>下了車，嘆了口長氣，看着車夫喂完了烏，走進一家小店去吃飯，我們也就跟着他走進去，想喝點水，門簾剛揭開，一陣油煙氣衝進鼻子里，連打了兩個嚏嘖，眼淚順着眼角流下來。顯在眼前的是一個佔了半間屋子的大坑，上面對躺着兩個年青人，在他們當中點着一盞油燈，旁邊是一小桶黑姻膏子，每人嘴里啣着支煙槍，眯着眼睛，正在促促地過癮？看見我們進來了，抬起上半截身子，向我們點點頭，岱和我“唔”了聲，要了壺白水，趕快跑出來。</p>
<p>無聊的坐在塊石頭上，看着從後山來的一連串的大車和驢子，上面亂糟糟地堆着衣物，傢俱，女人和孩子，他們是從武川一帶逃難出來的。</p>
<p>車夫吃完飯，又開始上路，我們倆個在車前走，進了這有名的娛蚣壩，路不過丈來寬，從一些亂石蒙茸的山岡上面婉蜓的斜扭下去，像條蚯蚓，又像條蜈蚣，極陡的地方，傾斜足有三十度，彎着身子方能掙上去，三四千尺的高地，氣壓減低了，便喘得急起來，我們張</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>開嘴，無聲的往上急走。</p>
<p>大約走了四五里，路向西拐彎，成了横的，向一座高峰衝上去，頭上冒着熱氣，身上淌出汗水來，襯衣貼在肉上頂不舒服。</p>
<p>“歇歇吧！”我説着就坐在一塊石頭上。</p>
<p>岱也揀了個地方坐下，掀起大衣里襟擦了擦額角上的汗。</p>
<p>抽了支烟，車也趕到了，我們重新站起來向上走，山勢雖然還有點陡，可是路已經稍微平點了，在驢子和大車排中穿行着，快到峰頂，路向左拐一拐，就到了壩頭，這是全山的最高峰，整個的大青山都踏在脚下，小的岡丘像許多墳堆子，亂雜的排列着，遠處的高峰，照在西斜的太陽光底下，變成了淡紫色。</p>
<p>後山的風尖峭的吹着，電綫吱吱地發着嚮音。</p>
<p>一輛載重汽車衝了上來，拖着一個灰烟尾巴，快到峰尖時，因有牛車碍路不能不暫停下來。唧唧地吼着發脾氣，汽車在三十度的斜坡中，受了本身的重量，便像吃屎蟲樣的倒爬下來。車上人趕緊跳下地，揀了塊大石頭頂住後論，然後轉灣拐到前面，下死勁的打了牛脊梁一下，趕牛車的漢子瞪了這個穿洋衣裳的一眼，急忙把車拉在道邊，讓汽車一溜屁的衝過去。</p>
<p>下坡路好走多了，身子輕鬆的跳躍着，邁過一條小的水渠，前面一塊冰塘擋住去路，冰凍得很平滑，看看還堅實，半溜着走上去，快到邊沿，聽見了碴碴地破碎聲，身子向　前傾斜，右腿已經浸冰水里，猛一跳，在乾地上躲了躲脚，鞋子上全變成冰泥了。</p>
<p>鮮紅的落日的餘暉，籠罩在羣山的光頭上，車帶着我們又走了二十里，七點鐘到了武川。</p>
<h3>靜穆</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>在窗前，那隻古銅的香爐裹，永遠是裊裊地飄着一縷微弱的白烟。白烟向着窗外飄出去，一絲殘餘的氣息却在室內飛繞着。帶着一點輕寒的風，從開着的窗口闖了進來，使芭蕉葉的影子在玻璃窗上印了許多圖案。</p>
<p>站在窗口，望着凝碧沉靜的天空，窗外的院子裏鋪了一層銀色的月光，一些樹梢在風中搖擺着，像是海裏波浪。</p>
<p>屋子裏只有一片淺綠的顏色，周遭更是那樣地沉寂，沉寂得好像走進了深山的古寺，而自己却彷彿在古寺的一角作着古銅色的夢。</p>
<p>偶然聽到巷口有人在呌賣夜食，可是那聲音裏似乎帶着一種凄涼的滋味，這滋味一直透進了我的心裹，像一枝利箭。</p>
<p>我不願聽那顫動的聲音，關上了窗門，將那古銅香爐搬了進來，放在窗前的桌上，重新在爐裏插上了三炷香，讓那香烟在室中飛繞着。</p>
<p>回到裏面，在爐子中加足了煤塊，火光便熊熊地熾着，像一條蛇舌似的從爐口上伸出來，舐着褐色的爐口。隨手將那雙籐椅拖到了爐邊，在那溫緩的空氣中，我就坐在爐前，凝視着熊熊的爐火出神。</p>
<p>突然，門外的長廊裏起了一陣急遂的脚步聲，但當這脚步聲打從我的門口經過後，立刻父歸於寂然了。</p>
<p>窗外的月光，悄悄地從坡璃窗中爬口進來，那山前禮拜堂裏晚禱的鐘聲，遠遠地讓那寒風帶到了我耳邊，蕩漾着中世紀的幻想，震破了沉寂的空氣。頓時，使我那凝固着的心田裏，起了一點小小的波動。</p>
<p>屋子裏只有一片淡碧的顏色，周遭仍舊是那樣的沉寂，沉寂得好像走進了深山的古寺，而自己却彷彿在古寺的一角作着人銅色的夢。</p>
<h3>來客</h3>
<p>— 燕汀</p>
<p>有一陣輕微的，扣門的聲音。……………</p>
<p>“進來”我大聲呌着，沒有從檺子裹抬起頭。</p>
<p>沒有上鎖的門，輕輕的頗動了幾下，啊的張開了。</p>
<p>“我想，我進去該不會吵榎你吧？……”説的是一種歉然，嘆息似的聲音。</p>
<p>“沒有關係，進來！”説着，我放下手中的工作。到這時，我才開始注意那個已從張開的門縫露出半身的夜間來客。他，一個骨骼高大，背微駝的中年男子，光頭，滿嘴長着鬍髭，身上只穿一絛單夾袍，因了外面下雨，衣服的大半部，已經透濕了。</p>
<p>他跨進門來，放下手中的手提箱，默默的站着，用湿潤的袖口去楷額前的雨珠。</p>
<p>“已經是二年了，我想你也許已記不起我。……”他不自然的微笑着，露出了滿口黃牙齒。“但是，我却沒有忘記你，而且還很清楚的記着你底地址。……”</p>
<p>“對不住，我還沒請敎，你是？……”我有點莫名其妙，可是却也沒有現出了自己底驚異和厭煩，相類的事情，我碰見太多了。</p>
<p>“朱”他介紹着自己道“我們從前在××路烟枝店樓上碰見過的，那時還有李和林兩個人。………</p>
<p>我默想着，搜遍了一切褪了色的記憶，自己雖不龍確定是否認得他，但他底面孔，枯啞的聲調，似像在什麼地方看見過却是事實。於是，我點着頭，把他底話默認下去了。</p>
<p>“坐吧”我説着“要不是你提起我倒忘了？……”停一息。“這一向過得還好？………”</p>
<p>他坐着，伸手接去我替他倒好的熱開水，用他水冷的手掌抱緊玻璃盃烘煖着，過了約半分鐘，又像餓狗吞肉骨頭似的連接着喝了幾口，然後才從地底下抬起頭來，霎着他圓大的眼睛，啞聲的呻吟着：</p>
<p>“沒有餓死已經是幸運了，還説得上好壞！”</p>
<p>“那麼，你是這兩三年中過得很壞？”我興趣的問。</p>
<p>他沒有立卽就答什麼，以默默的點着頭。過一會又低低的説道：</p>
<p>“説起來話太遠太长了。”一聲深沉的嘆息。“這三年來，我底生活差不多一半時間在監牢和流浪裹度過。當我們認得不久，技便離開上海到寧波鄉下去</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>

<p>，那兒有一個小學要我去教書的，第一學期很順利的過去了，在第二學期開頭，却爲了誤會，被人家告了××份子抓去關了半年，因爲没有證據才被放出來。但我却因此失了業，便帶着一付空肚　皮伴着一身破衣服到處流浪着，這樣過了一年多也是没法子想，終於又流落到上海來。………”</p>
<p>“來了很久吧？”我問。</p>
<p>“不！剛剛到。”他又悲哀地接下説道：“除了這隻破箱子我已什麽也没有了，朋友一時又找不着，住旅館没有錢，又是這樣的下雨天：因此我想到你，恰巧你還没搬。”靜默着，一會又低低的説道。“我想在你這兒寄一夜，你肯嗎？只要一條被窩，用報紙在地板下舖着就行了。”</p>
<p>他底愁苦的訴説，深深地把我感動了。</p>
<p>屋子外，雨仍悽落地下着，弄堂已變成死般的寂靜了。在這樣的情况中拒絶一個不幸者的請求無論怎樣是不行的，於是，我肯定地把頭點下了。</p>
<p>第二天，當我醒轉來時，雨已停了，雪花在飄着。</p>
<p>忽然我感覺了房子裏突然空虚起來，衣架上那件新皮袍不見了，堆在壁角的衣箱也有了翻動的痕跡。我吃驚着爬起床來，那個夜間的來客，和他底破手提箱一起不見了。我變得像熱鍋上的螞蟻一樣地焦亂，在房子裏擺着手走來走去，終於在檯子上我找到了這樣的一張紙條：</p>
<p>“當你爬起來時，你也許會吃驚你已失竊了，但這又能怪我嗎，我已餓過了幾天，以後也還需要生活下去的。………”</p>
<p>我没有説什麽，我變得安靜起來了。</p>

<p>影片『阿比西尼亞』很客觀地紀錄了阿比西尼亞的英勇的神聖的民族戰爭，因此在上海公映的時候，就受到意國的阻撓。</p>
<p>我國政府爲了顧全中意邦交，特　把已經准許公映的這影片提回重新檢查。許多有『刺激性』的畫面都被删去了，但是二月二十日在上海大戲院開始繼續公映的第　天，意國水兵僑民等竟用暴力干涉我們同胞欣賞這個影片，毆打我們的同胞，以致有好幾十人受傷，並且奪去凡是被壓廹民族都熱烈愛護的這個影片而燒毁它，戲院方面也連帶的受到極大的損失。</p>
<p>這是對於我們國家的極大侮辱，在意國水兵的頭腦裏，已經没有了中國監督電影的主權，没有了中國的法權與警權。</p>
<p>我們確信政府會對意國提出賠償損失，懲罰兇手，道歉並保證以後不再發生同類事件的要求。我們希望全上海全國的電影衆與愛國同胞一致起來作政府强硬交涉的後盾！</p>

<h3>Ministry of Justice Revises the Organization of Subsidiary Courts</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] At the beginning of preparing for the implementation of the new trial system, the Ministry of Justice stipulated that the district courts in the same location as the branch courts of the High Court would have their presidents and chief prosecutors concurrently held by the presidents and chief prosecutors of the High Court branch courts, respectively, in order to save expenses. However, since the implementation, the exercise of powers by the concurrently serving officials has been hindered. The Ministry has carefully reviewed the originally established number of judges and prosecutors in the local courts that have adopted this concurrent service method and has prescribed eleven amendment methods: (1) For those originally with multiple judges, one of them should be changed to a judge concurrently serving as president. (2) For those originally with one judge and one or more candidate judges, the judge should be changed to a recommended judge serving concurrently as president. (3) For those originally with only one judge, it should be changed to a judge serving concurrently as president, and one additional candidate judge should be added. (4) For those originally with only one candidate judge, one judge serving concurrently as president should be added. (5) For those originally with multiple candidate judges, one of them should be changed to a judge serving concurrently as president. (6) For those originally with multiple prosecutors, one of them should be changed to a prosecutor. (7) For those originally with only one prosecutor, the original system of not establishing a chief prosecutor according to law should be maintained. (8) For those originally with one prosecutor and one or more candidate prosecutors, the original system of not establishing a chief prosecutor according to general practice should be maintained. (9) For those originally with only one candidate prosecutor, it should be changed to a prosecutor. (10) For those originally with multiple candidate prosecutors, one of them should be changed to a prosecutor. (11) For those originally without a prosecutor and without candidate personnel and handled concurrently by the prosecutors of the High Court branch courts, one prosecutor should be added. The above methods have been communicated by the Ministry to the High Courts of various provinces for compliance and correction. In the future, when new High Court branch courts are established, this concurrent service method will no longer be adopted. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Land Registration in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Nanjing's land registration has been carried out for two years and has been very successful. Mayor Ma Chushuo told reporters that the registration of the urban area has been completed, and the rural area has also begun. Nanjing has 600,000 mu of agricultural land, and it is planned to entrust the Land Survey Bureau to use aerial surveys in order to complete it as soon as possible. Approximately 35,000 cases of registered land have been announced, except for those in dispute and in litigation in the courts. Land deeds and charts will be issued after the procedures are completed. The provisional registration is entirely for the sake of protecting the property rights of the people, and owners can request the restoration of property rights within one year of the expiration date. In short, the registration procedures are extremely cumbersome. The Land Administration Bureau often works late into the night to facilitate the owners. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>French Pacific Society Lectures on the Development of Aviation in Our Country</h3>
<p>No Less Than the European Lines, Everything in China is Trending Towards Modernization</p>
<p>[Paris] The French Pacific Problem Research Association, organized by left-wing figures, recently held a meeting this morning. The chairman was the famous Sinologist Professor Paul Pelliot. The association member, Bao Gang, gave a detailed report on the development and current situation of commercial aviation in China. Bao Gang first stated that the commercial aviation industry in China was founded between 1929 and 1930. At that time, airlines began to be established, commercial airports were built, and air routes were surveyed and mapped. After six years of construction, there are now three airlines established in the country: China National Aviation Corporation, Southwest Aviation Corporation, both of which are jointly operated by China and the United States, and Eurasia Aviation Corporation, which is a joint venture between China and Germany. The air routes currently operated by these companies are more than 19,000 kilometers long. Among them, the companies jointly operated by China and the United States use Douglas aircraft for land travel and three types of seaplanes, namely Douglas, Dolphin, and Fairchild, all of which are made in the United States. Their speeds range from 140 kilometers to 280 kilometers per hour. The Eurasia Aviation Corporation uses German Junkers aircraft, each of which can carry 18 passengers at a speed of 300 kilometers per hour. In general, the punctuality and safety of Chinese commercial aviation are no less than those of the major European airmail lines. Various industries in China are now trending towards modernization, but the progress they have made is led by commercial aviation. Chinese commercial aircraft are not only fast but also inexpensive. For example, there is no railway or highway from Kunming, Yunnan Province, to Chengdu, Sichuan Province. Transportation by donkeys and horses takes about 30 days. Now, airplanes can reach it in three hours. For example, it takes about 40 hours to travel from Shanghai to Beiping via the Jinghu and Jinpu Railways. If you take an airplane, it can be shortened to six hours. The speed of recovery is evident. Bao Gang continued, although France has not participated in the development of commercial aviation in mainland China, France is responsible for the aviation transportation between the Far East and Europe. The aircraft of the French Airlines Company are currently operating regular flights between Hanoi, Vietnam and Europe. Mail from the most remote areas of mainland China is transported by French aircraft via Hanoi to Europe, and vice versa. The aircraft used on this route are the "Potez 62," with a speed of 240 kilometers per hour. French Airlines is currently working to improve the route. From April 1 of this year, the entire route will be shortened from eight days to six days. From October of this year, the Latécoère aircraft will be used instead, which can increase the speed to 300 kilometers per hour. Therefore, the journey from Paris to Hanoi will take only five days, or five and a half days. In other words, assuming that Sunday is the first time in Paris, it can fly to Hanoi on Friday, and vice versa. If the two terminals stay for 48 hours each, the round trip will take only two weeks.

<p>Valid for Three and a Half Years - British Ships Enjoy Preferential Treatment</p>
<p>[London] The text of the recent trade agreement between Britain and the Dominion of Canada was released today. The agreement is valid until August 20, 1940, at which time either party may give six months' notice of termination. Canada agrees to further reduce the preferential tariff rates on 150 categories of British imports. British goods entering Canada will therefore receive preferential treatment accounting for 40 percent of the total. Most of the reductions range from 2.5 to 5 percent, while the remainder range from 5 to 20 percent. The second category mainly includes textiles. The agreement also reaffirms the established practice of allowing 20 percent of British goods entering Canada to receive duty-free treatment. Britain will allow current duty-free goods to continue to be duty-free, but reserves the right to modify the treatment of dairy products. Furthermore, with the exception of dried fruits, the previous preferential treatment for Canadian goods will be maintained. Canadian cattle will continue to be imported duty-free. However, Canada declares its willingness to assist the British government in implementing policies to regulate the sale of these goods. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 26th)</p>

<h3>Avoiding the Name and Seeking the Reality in Diplomacy toward China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Nan Yun</p>
<p>The Core of the Hayashi Cabinet's Program</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>However, the previous cabinet's approach to diplomacy toward China was simply too clumsy. The phrases "neighborly relations" and "anti-communist pact" were frequently mentioned, and there were constant cries of "grave determination" and "use of force," but without achieving any substantial results. After criticism from various quarters, a conclusion was reached: that future diplomacy toward China should "avoid the name and seek the reality." This "avoiding the name and seeking the reality" diplomacy toward China has been adopted by Prime Minister Hayashi.</p>
<p>Consider his explanation of continental policy: "Continental policy is about developing toward the continent... For the stability of East Asia, we will strive to make China understand the true intentions of the Empire..." Regarding the North China problem, he said: "The Empire absolutely has no intention of aggression towards North China...". As for the "anti-communist pact," he no longer mentions it, expressing it in other words: "...The most important thing at this time is to harmonize the feelings between the peoples of the two countries, to seek the clarification of international relations, and to work together to achieve the stability of East Asia... Those who hinder such efforts must be eliminated... Anti-Japanese sentiment is an obstacle to Sino-Japanese cooperation and must be corrected..." (The above are all excerpts from Prime Minister Hayashi's speech).</p>
<p>In short, "anti-Japanese" feelings are due to China "misunderstanding" the "good intentions" of the Japanese government. To achieve "East Asian stability," it is necessary to "sweep away China's misunderstandings."</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>Although there were many questions from members of the Diet to the Hayashi Cabinet, it is quite evident that the major political parties of today are very weak even in their ability to defend themselves (for fear of dissolution). In fact, the Hayashi Cabinet's appearance in the Diet to make a report is merely a necessary formality of today. Therefore, this article analyzes the Hayashi Cabinet's policies and points out that the central point of the Hayashi Cabinet's policies is still the problem of China policy, and it should be noted that this is an experiment in "avoiding the name and seeking the reality" in diplomacy—but with the courage to "cross the line."</p>
<p>㊄</p>
<p>The military is supporting the Hayashi Cabinet, but is also monitoring it. General Hayashi was aggressive at the beginning of forming the cabinet, and Shigeji Kasahara, a staff officer of the cabinet headquarters, represented the radical faction of the Army Ministry. The new Army Minister that General Hayashi demanded was also a "radical" within the military, Lieutenant General Seishiro Itagaki (chief of staff of the Kwantung Army, who Japanese newspapers said made "Manchurian children stop crying when they heard Itagaki was coming"). The new Navy Minister he requested was Admiral Soji Toyoda, but both were rejected by the upper echelons of the Army and Navy. After the rejection, they expressed compromise. On the basis of this compromise, the Hayashi Cabinet received support and was also subject to monitoring. The political parties were also dissatisfied with the Hayashi Cabinet (they were not allowed to join the cabinet), but they could not oppose it.</p>
<p>The Hayashi Cabinet is definitely stronger than the Hirota Cabinet. First, the Hayashi Cabinet has further cooperated with financial capitalists. The current Finance Minister, Yuki Sonogi, was the head of the Osaka branch of the Bank of Japan, and also held important positions at the Yasuda Bank and was the president of the Industrial Bank of Japan. Moreover, the newly appointed president of the Bank of Japan is the so-called "conspirator of the Mitsui group," Ikeda Shigeaki. Due to the cooperation between Ikeda and Yuki, the function of the Bank of Japan (i.e., the central bank of Japan) has expanded from simple commercial activities to industrial activities. This is clearly a form of financial oligarchy. Second, since the Hayashi Cabinet has compromised with and received the support of the gradualist faction of the current military, it is certainly reliable. Moreover, in fact, with the emergence of the Hayashi Cabinet, the cooperation between the military and financial capitalists has gone a step further. In the recent stage, the driving force behind the undercurrents has been the confrontational relationship between the zaibatsu, such as the confrontation between Mitsubishi and Mitsui. However, this article cannot analyze these in detail. The purpose of this article is to reveal the current Japanese cabinet's political program—China policy.</p>
<p>In this Diet session, I heard Army Minister Sugiyama say: "Currently, the Soviet military strength in the Far East is about fifteen or sixteen divisions. Their tanks and aircraft are very dominant. Comparatively, Japan is at a disadvantage. To say that the military budget is too large—it is not enough, how can we realize the policy towards the puppet government of Manchuria and the policy towards China?..."!</p>
<p>However, at the time this article was written, the major conferences in Tokyo and Nanjing had not yet closed! (January 17)</p>

<h3>Will Germany Invade Czechoslovakia?</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Following German Foreign Minister Neurath's visit to Austria, the semi-official London Times suddenly published a report stating that the purpose of Neurath's trip was to annex Czechoslovakia. This report, published in the traditionally conservative and even overly cautious Times, particularly attracted international attention. From this report, peace-loving people in countries around the world feel that, in addition to the serious issue of Spain, another huge new crisis is brewing in Central Europe.</p>
<p>"Will Germany invade Czechoslovakia?" This is a question that many sensitive political observers have been exploring for a year. The Nazi Party's incitement of many German residents within Czechoslovakia has been intensifying step by step in recent years. Last July, Hans Krebs, the leader of the "Sudeten German Party" associated with the Nazi Party, went to London to seek funding from pro-German elements in Britain. At the Nazi Party Congress in Nuremberg, Goebbels and Rosenberg even fabricated rumors that the Soviet Union had built secret airfields in Czechoslovakia in preparation for attacking Germany. Thereafter, Nazi newspapers under Goebbels's direction began a large-scale anti-Czech campaign. Their anti-propaganda mainly consisted of three points: (1) That Czech politics were controlled by a small number of people; (2) That the German minority in Czechoslovakia was economically oppressed; (3) That after the conclusion of the Czech-Soviet mutual assistance treaty, Czechoslovakia had become a bulwark of Bolshevism. Such organized rumors and slanders caused the Czech government to feel extremely angry and uneasy, and therefore protested to the German side. The British side, due to its anxiety about this situation, also sent people to Czechoslovakia for an on-the-spot investigation. According to the results of the British investigation as a third party, the reports in the German newspapers were all exaggerations of anti-propaganda. However, from that time until now, the Nazi Party's anti-Czech propaganda has continued vigorously.</p>
<p>The purpose of this anti-propaganda is very obvious. It is that Germany can use the pretext of liberating oppressed Germans and preventing the spread of Bolshevik forces into Central Europe to send troops to invade Czechoslovakia. Such a military plan has long been carefully considered by the Berlin General Staff. In recent years, Germany has been carrying out preparations for an attack on Czechoslovakia in both military and diplomatic aspects. In the military field, the Nazi Party's contact and coordination with German organizations within Czechoslovakia is an open secret. Once war breaks out, there is no doubt that the Germans within Czechoslovakia will respond to the invading German army. At the same time, Germany's close ties with Poland and Hungary, and its recent active control of Austria, all have the effect of militarily encircling Czechoslovakia. As for diplomacy, Germany is trying to divide the Little Entente and undermine Czechoslovakia's alliance with France and the Soviet Union. After German Finance Minister Schacht's tour last year, the Yugoslav authorities have been bought off by the Nazi Party's marks. And Germany's constant denigration of Czechoslovakia as a bulwark of Bolshevism and its false accusation that the country allows the Soviet Union to build secret airfields are aimed at forcing it to abandon its mutual assistance relationship with the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Once the military encirclement is complete, or Czechoslovakia's diplomatic position is shaken, the Nazi invasion forces can take the opportunity to attack. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, Czechoslovakia is clear about Germany's plans. It itself will never waver, nor will it allow itself to become diplomatically isolated. At the same time, Britain and France understand that once Germany invades Czechoslovakia, it will be the first signal of a major war in Europe. For the sake of peace in Europe and the entire world, they must jointly prevent Germany from taking this adventurous move. In this regard, the London Times's initial disclosure of Germany's ambition to annex Czechoslovakia may be a forceful warning.</p>
<h3>British Chancellor and Home Secretary Defend Defense Plan</h3>
<p>Consistent with Foreign Policy, Financially Sound, No Crisis Mentioned, Defense Loan Bill Passes Second Reading in the Lower House</p>
<p>[London] The government's proposed temporary defense expenditure bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons yesterday afternoon by a vote of 307 to 132.</p>
<p>When the debate began, Chancellor Chamberlain explained the bill, saying, "What is the purpose of British defense policy? Foreign Secretary Eden explained it in his speech in Leamington. Do the opposition parties think that British armaments should not be used to achieve the purposes described by Eden? Do they think that there are other uses besides those described by Eden?" Chamberlain further stated, "The government's annual fiscal revenue is approximately 400 million pounds. Therefore, the government's implementation of the defense plan will not cause an excessive imbalance between revenue and expenditure."</p>
<p>Finally, Home Secretary Simon concluded the debate, saying, "As far as the current situation is concerned, British defense urgently needs substantial expansion. The government and the opposition generally agree on this point, with no disagreements. Moreover, the government's policy is to promote international coordination to consolidate world peace. The special defense expenditure bill submitted to the House is not a manifestation of a new policy. Our military buildup is compelled by circumstances and does not mean abandoning our original policy. It merely adopts a new method to give this policy greater practical effect. Britain is not a militaristic country, as evidenced by the facts. It is only committed to maintaining peace. This is known to all countries in the world. It is regrettable that certain countries have strong armaments and are outside the League of Nations, making the implementation of the collective security system even more difficult." Simon also said that the government should pay special attention to coordinating the affairs of the army, navy, and air force, as well as air defense. Regarding air defense, a staff department has been formed with a large scale and many civil servants to work closely with local authorities in various provinces and cities. As for gas masks, the daily production has reached as many as 100,000, which is sufficient for use. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>[London] When the British Defense Loan Bill was presented for its second reading in the House of Commons today, Chancellor Chamberlain severely refuted the opposition's arguments. After Chamberlain defended the government's proposal, the opposition party, represented by Lees-Smith, proposed a motion to reject the government's recommendation. Lees-Smith's motion stated that the parliament regrets the accumulation of a large amount of competitive defense armaments and opposes raising defense funds by borrowing. Therefore, the parliament must reject this measure, which would weaken national credit, increase prices, and depress living standards, and because it cannot prevent unscrupulous merchants from profiting and lacks a coordinated defense plan.</p>
<p>Lees-Smith claimed that the Minister for Coordination of Defense, Sir Thomas Inskip, did not have the ability to resolve the situation but was merely a buffer between the various defense agencies, slightly mediating when each agency was extracting resources as much as possible by borrowing. Lees-Smith also expressed dissatisfaction with the limits of coordination and planning declared in Inskip's speech. He said that there are currently seventeen ministers in the parliament, thirteen of whom should be questioned about war preparations, but it is not clear whether Inskip is coordinating among these thirteen. Lees-Smith further advocated the organization of a Civil Planning Committee to work in parallel with the Committee of Imperial Defence on defense issues.</p>
<p>Lees-Smith said he was unwilling to accept the verbal guarantees of prominent financiers such as Keynes cited by Chancellor Chamberlain. He believed that the nation's borrowing power should be reserved and used for military spending during times of commercial decline to prevent economic recession from multiplying unpreparedness. However, the government has no such plan. If military spending is exhausted, it will be a day of complete depletion of resources, which will inevitably cause a major disaster of industrial decline. Lees-Smith also said that Hitler's every move is aimed at his own interests, while other countries are making concessions. Britain has also repeatedly made concessions in the past. In this way, the people will be led astray, and Hitler will be induced to move forward invisibly. However, he does not believe that Britain will always retreat, but if the United States does not make the German leader understand the limits of what Britain can tolerate, it may lead to an irreparable mistake.</p>
<p>Chamberlain then spoke, beginning the debate, saying that Attlee had said last week that the Defense Loan Bill was a "war plan." Now there is no such statement in the resolution, which he is very pleased with. The Chancellor continued, "If there is no reason to believe that war is imminent, it is unfortunate to be overly anxious and fearful." As for the fact that the House of Commons is apprehensive about the large-scale competitive expansion of national armaments, he himself is also horrified by the rearmament of Europe and the huge unproductive expenses required by various countries. Even today, with little optimism for the future, he is still not disappointed and is trying to find a new venue for countries to reconnect to prevent this foolish action from proceeding to the point of no return. However, there should be no relaxation until the country's security has been prepared and it has the ability to fulfill its international obligations. The Labour Party has repeatedly pretended not to know the relationship between the government's rearmament program and its foreign policy, which is regrettable. It should be known that this relationship was clearly explained by the Foreign Secretary, but the opposition parties still turned a blind eye to the Foreign Secretary's remarks, so he asks the House to forgive him for repeating the Foreign Secretary's remarks now.</p>
<p>The Chancellor then read an important declaration made by Eden in Leamington on November 20 of last year: "These weapons will never be used for wars of aggression, nor will they be used to achieve purposes that conflict with the League of Nations Covenant or the Paris Peace Pact." The Chancellor then questioned the Labour Party's spokesperson as to whether they believe that British weapons should not be used for any of the purposes stated by the Foreign Secretary, or whether they believe that they should be used for any other purpose than these. He would not deal seriously with this ambiguous accusation until the Labour Party no longer evaded this straightforward question and gave a clear answer. The Chancellor then criticized the Labour Party's accusations that the government's proposal would weaken national credit, depress living standards, and that the bill did not contain effective measures to prevent excessive profiteering, saying that among all the issues related to the rearmament program, the one that has received the most focused attention is the prevention of price gouging. He said that everything that human intelligence can reach and physical strength can accomplish to achieve this goal has not been neglected. The Chancellor then explained in detail the institutions established by the Treasury for this purpose and the principles on which the planning for this matter is based, saying, "You can trust me that from the Treasury's point of view, I am very satisfied with properly protecting the interests of taxpayers."</p>
<p>The Chancellor continued, saying that some people say that the government's proposal will adversely affect national credit, and that it is disturbing that a huge amount of military expenditure is being consumed on the one hand, and that borrowing is required to cover a portion of this expenditure on the other hand. Such remarks are contrary to the facts. In the past six years, national credit has gradually become more and more solid. During the economic downturn, the debt of all other countries has increased. For example, the US national debt has increased by more than 330 million pounds sterling in the past six years, while Britain's is far less. Although Britain had to suspend its debt repayment fund, in the three years from 1933 to 1936, Britain's national expenditure surplus was over 40 million pounds, and it also repaid debts of 32.5 million pounds, so the remaining 72.5 million pounds is enough to cover the average cost of the debt raising proposed in the bill. At the same time, living standards are protected by the continuous increase in expenditure on social welfare. In the last budget of the Labour government, although there were many unemployed people, the expenditure on social welfare was only 45 million pounds, while this year, although the number of unemployed people has greatly decreased, this expenditure is 68 million pounds.</p>
<p>The Chancellor then referred to the Labour Party's prediction that the government's policy would cause inflation and refuted it with the words of economist Keynes in yesterday's speech. Keynes had said that the Treasury's borrowing of 400 million pounds would not cause inflation. The Chancellor expressed sympathy with Keynes' words, that the people have savings or other needs to use them, and that the government's borrowing will only use a small part of it. Therefore, the theory of inflation is purely a fantasy.</p>
<p>The Chancellor concluded by saying that the Labour Party suggested that all defense expenditure should be covered by this year's tax revenue. If this is the case, taxes must be greatly increased, which would lead the rationality of finance into a dangerous path.</p>

<p>Former Chancellor Horne also spoke in the debate, saying that the country can afford this 400 million pound loan in this step forward. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 21st)</p>
<h3>British Empire Shipping Relations and National Defense</h3>
<p>Shipping Merchants Urge Government Attention</p>
<p>[London] The British Chamber of Shipping held its annual meeting yesterday and passed a resolution urging shipping merchants to pay attention to the importance of the position occupied by the shipping industry in the British Empire's national defense plan. This resolution was proposed by Sir Essendon, a shipping magnate in the UK. Essendon also asked to pay attention to the serious threat to the British Empire's overseas transportation posed by foreign shipping subsidies and economic nationalism, especially from the East and the Far East. Essendon expressed the hope that the Imperial Government, with the help of the Imperial Shipping Committee, would examine the current environment and find ways to preserve and maintain a merchant fleet commensurate with the needs of the Empire. Essendon continued, "Every item in the current defense plan is being expanded and consolidated, but if the merchant fleet cannot meet the needs of peace and war at the same time, then national defense is completely lacking in substance." Essendon then referred to the danger to British shipping caused by foreign shipping subsidies, saying that he hoped that the governments of various dominions would pay attention to the current situation at the upcoming Imperial Conference and would immediately find ways to provide adequate protection for the shipping industry of the Empire when concrete proposals are put forward. Subsequently, Hold, the president of the Shipping Association, described the decline of the British shipping industry, stating that the tonnage of British merchant ships in June 1926 decreased by 2 million tons compared to June 1914, but during the same period, the tonnage of foreign merchant ships increased from 28 million tons to 47.8 million tons. Hold recognized this as an unsettling situation. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Submarines</h3>
<p>One Can Be Completed Every Month, Ranking First in the World</p>
<p>[London] According to the naval correspondent of the "Daily Telegraph," Soviet submarines have ranked first in the world and are continuing to increase. It is said that the Soviet Union currently has 40 submarines stationed in the northern Pacific, 90 in the Baltic Sea, while the number of submarines in the United States, France, and Italy is only 100, 92, and 86 respectively. The correspondent also said that the Soviet Russian Pacific Fleet is increasing by one submarine every month. (National Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources, the Soviet Russian government is currently building submarines on a large scale, and one submarine can be added to the fleet every month. It is reported that there are currently 40 submarines in Vladivostok, and the authorities hope to increase it to 50 by the end of the year. The Soviet Union also has 90 submarines distributed in the Baltic Sea. It is found that the United States currently has a total of 100 submarines, France has a total of 92, and Italy has a total of 87. Soviet Russia officially reported that the country has only four submarines. Everyone believes this statement to be false. However, the Soviet Russian government never notifies other countries of any information about its naval strength. What it notifies is only the warships before the European War and its shipbuilding program. It is believed that the main naval shipyards of Soviet Russia are located on the coast of the Black Sea, where they are not accessible to aircraft attacks. The submarines built are transported from the factory to various ports in the Baltic Sea and the Far East for assembly. The time required to build each submarine clearly depends on its type and size. It takes an average of two years for Britain to build a submarine. It is reported that the submarines built by Soviet Russia are all small and are only for use in coastal waters, so the time required for construction is short, and it is easy to disassemble and transport by rail.

<h3>Mezhlauk Replaces as Chairman of the Soviet Heavy Industry Committee</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The Presidium of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union decided to appoint Mezhlauk as the Chairman of the Heavy Industry Committee. Mezhlauk's original position as Deputy Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars and Chairman of the State Planning Committee concurrently have been removed. Smirnov was appointed as the Chairman of the State Planning Committee. (TASS dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Japan Decides to Send Economic Envoys to Shanghai</h3>
<p>To Participate in the General Assembly of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, A Group of Twelve Will Set Off Next Month</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since receiving the decision of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association to convene a meeting in Shanghai on March 18, the Japanese-Chinese Trade Association has suddenly become active. Among the twelve people scheduled to go to China to participate in the meeting, those who have already been decided are: Kenji Kodama, President of the Japanese-Chinese Trade Association, Reisuke Ishida, Managing Director of Mitsui Bussan, Shin Hori, President of Nisshin Kisen, Noboru Otani, President of Nippon Yusen, Kenzo Taihei, Managing Director of Sumitomo Bank, Keizaburo Kato, President of the Bank of Japan and Korea, Hyakutaro Miyakegawa, Advisor to Mitsubishi Corporation, Seijiro Miyajima, involved with Mitsubishi Goshi Kaisha, Akino Okitsugu, and Tōichi Sako, Director of the Japanese-Chinese Trade Association. The remaining two people may be selected from Osaka tomorrow. The group will set off from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru on March 12. It is expected that they will spend a week in Nanjing and Shanghai, receiving formal entertainment, and each individual will hold consultations with various sectors of China. The delegation does not have a formal name. All members will attend the general assembly of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association in Shanghai as members of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association. However, in reality, it is tantamount to an economic delegation, so both financial circles in Japan have great expectations for it. The delegation will carry concrete plans to break the Sino-Japanese deadlock and promote economic cooperation. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Economic Survey Group Intends to Deceive Britain with a Fake Mandate</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The European and American survey group dispatched by the Japan Economic Federation will depart in April, stay in the United States for a month, cross over to the UK in early July, hold a UK-Japan economic conference, and discuss economic issues between the two countries. The content includes UK-Manchuria economic cooperation, UK-Japan cotton industry, and economic issues between the two countries in China. The Japanese side plans to hold a conference between officials and civilians after the member list of the envoy group is determined to decide on the issues Japan will propose at the UK-Japan meeting. When the UK sent an economic survey group to Japan, it signed an agreement with officials and civilians of Japan and Manchuria that when Manchuria purchases materials from foreign countries in the future, it should purchase a large number of goods from the UK. Therefore, after the Japanese delegation goes to the UK, it will discuss Manchuria-UK economic issues and try its best to mediate the implementation of this matter. (Allied dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Unification of Japanese Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Sugiyama Responds to Assemblymen's Questions, Saying a Decision to Pay Serious Attention</p>
<p>[Tokyo] When the Japanese House of Representatives held its budget general meeting today, Minseito Party member Toyotaka Toyota asked Army Minister Sugiyama whether the Army Minister has a firm determination to deal with the incident of the Army's overseas personnel interfering with the unification of diplomacy. Sugiyama replied that serious attention should be paid to the consistency of diplomatic policy. However, since military agreements exist in North China, the army must conduct direct consultations on issues concerning the area. However, at the same time, it should take coordinated steps with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and pay special attention to ensuring that overseas personnel always strictly abide by instructions.

<h3>Monitoring Plan for the Western Sea Surface, Russia and Portugal Refuse to Participate</h3>
<p>The Work of the Adjustment Committee Encounters Obstacles Again, Land Monitoring Is Practically Resolved</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the monitoring of the Spanish sea surface, the governments of Russia and Portugal have recently refused to participate. Therefore, only the governments of the UK, France, Germany, and Italy are participating in the monitoring work. (According to the original plan of the Adjustment Committee, the sea area near the territory of the Nationalist Army in the Bay of Biscay in northern Spain was assigned to the Russian Navy for monitoring, while the sea area near the territory of the Basque Autonomous Region of the government army in that area was assigned to the Portuguese Navy for monitoring. (Havas on the 26th)</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War continued its discussion this morning on (1) the Spanish sea surface monitoring plan and (2) the Spanish land border monitoring plan. Regarding the former, the navies of the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Portugal were originally scheduled to be responsible for monitoring in separate zones. However, the Russian representative, the country's ambassador to the UK, Maisky, suddenly stated in the committee today that the country's government did not intend to participate in this work. This move was unexpected. At the same time, the Portuguese representative followed by stating that the country was invited to participate in the sea surface monitoring work because Russia requested participation. (According to the original plan of the subcommittee, only the navies of the UK, France, Germany, and Italy would be responsible for monitoring. Later, because Russia expressed opposition, it was changed to being responsible by the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Portugal in separate zones.) Now that Russia has decided to abandon it, the Portuguese government will also not participate in the matter. However, if any other fifth country requests to participate in the future, Portugal will still come out to take on the monitoring work. Regarding the land border monitoring plan, it has been practically resolved today. Once the subcommittee continues to meet on Monday next week, its content will be determined. In essence, the number of monitors at the border between France and Spain and between Portugal and Spain will be set at 130 each, without any distinction. (According to the original plan, the number of monitors at the border between France and Spain was set at 160, which was 30 more than at the border between Portugal and Spain, which was opposed by France.)

<p>Daredevil Squads Charge Forward, Oviedo May Fall Any Day Now</p>
<p>⊙Madrid Front Line Several thousand government troops from the daredevil squads emerged from the Segovia Bridge position yesterday and attacked the Kasatka Gamba Garden. After two hours of fierce fighting, the government troops charged forward one after another, unstoppable. However, the rebel army waited at leisure, guarding key points, and machine-gunned the government troops, resulting in the annihilation of the entire army. The rebel army also died or were wounded by a thousand people. At present, the two armies are busy rescuing the dead and wounded soldiers. (National Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>⊙Gijón The miners in the Spanish government army occupied the machine gun nests and bullfighting arena of the Oviedo garrison yesterday. Today, they will break through the front line and launch an offensive with the aim of reaching the small armory, which is an important stronghold of the rebel army. The government army is confident that it will be successful within a few hours. (National Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>⊙Madrid The authorities have recently received a message sent from the city of Oviedo in the northwest late last night, stating that the government troops there have occupied many new positions inside and outside the city and occupied the armory factory buildings. The Nationalist Army has attacked three times but was repelled by the government troops. (Havas dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Declaration by Japanese Prime Minister: Implementing Narrow Definition of National Defense</h3>
<p>Also Stated That Party Cabinet Members Could Be Used; Budget General Meeting Breaks Out in Laughter</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget General Meeting reopened at 7:15 PM on the 25th. Minseitō party member Takeji Matsuda questioned the Minister of Commerce and Industry, Godo, regarding the mechanization of forces within national defense expenditures, and the foundation of national fuel policy. Godo listed detailed figures in his response. Matsuda then addressed the Minister of War, stating that the authorities should crack down on rumors circulating between the military and the public. The Minister of War requested a closed meeting to explain the matter. After explaining the situation, the closed meeting was adjourned at 7:50 PM.</p>
<p>Matsuda asked, what is the Army's opinion regarding local allocation taxes?</p>
<p>The Minister of War replied that they will temporarily endure and strive to construct agricultural facilities in the future.</p>
<p>Next, Seiyūkai party member Hatsutarō Haraguchi and Interior Minister Kawarada debated the issue of tuberculosis prevention. Yosaji Yutani of the Tōhōkai party then took the stand to question whether the Hayashi Cabinet's slogan of enhancing national defense signifies the broad definition of national defense from the time of War Minister Araki, or refers to a narrow definition of national defense. He requested a clear answer as a prerequisite for criticizing and deliberating budget policies.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi answered that the current cabinet's national defense prioritizes the narrow definition of national defense against imminent dangers. At the same time, it also implies preparations for broad national defense in parallel.</p>
<p>The Minister of War also expressed the same opinion.</p>
<p>Yutani asked if the Prime Minister had stated that the situation at the time of forming the cabinet did not allow for the employment of party members as cabinet ministers, what is the situation today?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied that it may be possible to employ party cabinet members.</p>
<p>This response from the Prime Minister caused the assembled members to burst out in laughter. The meeting adjourned at 10:30 PM.</p>
<p>The House of Representatives Budget General Meeting opened at 10:00 AM today. Tadashi Satō (Minseitō party) requested an explanation of the security situation in "Manchukuo." Vice-Minister of War, Umezu, explained it in detail.</p>
<p>Kazuo Ikuta (Seiyūkai party) asked how Prime Minister Hayashi interprets the term "emergency situation."</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied that he interprets today's situation as a difficult one. Ikuta asked what the definition of a difficult situation is.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied that since the Manchurian Incident, the Empire has been placed in a position of international isolation. That is, the issue of "Manchukuo," and other ideological points, have also placed us in various difficult positions. Ikuta discussed countermeasures against ideological anxiety and insecurity in life, and questioned the Prime Minister's views.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied that while he has considered it conceptually, the cabinet was only recently formed, and he hopes for understanding within the scope expressed in the budget.</p>
<p>Ikuta also inquired about the enhancement of national defense, especially the beliefs of the Army authorities regarding the preparation and expansion of the Air Force, which was answered by Vice-Minister Umezu.</p>
<p>Regarding diplomacy with China, Yutaka Toyota of the Minseitō party stated that in order to establish peace in the Far East, what about joining hands with the Soviet Union, while taking a firm stance against countries with a tendency to interfere in the Far East?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied that he will strive for peace based on the spirit of coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<p>Toyota further mentioned the Pacific problem and stated that in order to escape the crisis of an era without treaties, what about dispatching influential civilians to the United States?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hayashi replied that there is a need for people-to-people diplomacy with the United States, which goes without saying. War Minister Sugiyama replied that people-to-people diplomacy must be unified, which goes without saying. The military also feels the same way about this matter. However, regarding the North China issue, the military cannot be unconcerned due to the Rehe Operation, the Umezu-He Agreement, and the Suiyuan Incident. But the military will definitely maintain close liaison with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and will not exceed the scope permitted to the military. There was a recess at 12:30 AM.

<h3>Political Collusion Between Italy and Germany</h3>
<p>Italy Changes Policy, Opposes Austrian Restoration; Does Not Attend Raw Materials Allocation Conference</p>
<p>[Rome] According to declarations from authoritative sources, Italy currently does not support the restoration of the Habsburg monarchy in Austria. Gaida, the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stated in an article published in the Italian newspaper that now is not the time for the Habsburg restoration, because no one in Austria or abroad feels the need to change the current political system. Furthermore, this kind of change is extremely dangerous because it is enough to incite internal strife. It has been discovered that Italy previously had a tendency to support the final restoration of the Habsburg monarchy, but now suddenly changing its attitude proves the consensus of German and Italian opinions regarding international politics. Germany has firmly opposed the restoration of the Austrian royal family. Now that Italy shares the same view, the restoration movement has suffered a fatal blow. (Central News Agency, 26th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Council of the League of Nations previously organized a fourteen-nation committee to study the issue of allocating world raw materials. The committee is currently scheduled to meet in Geneva on the eighth of next month. Germany notified the Secretariat of the League of Nations some time ago that it would decline to participate. It has recently been learned that Italy has also decided not to attend. (Havas News Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Consultations on Neutrality Issues; Leader of French Fascist Party Arrested and Released</p>
<p>[London] Political figures have recently announced that Belgian Prime Minister Janson will come to Britain in the near future to consult with the British government on the issue of Belgian neutrality. (Note: The Belgian government submitted a reply to the British government on the 12th of this month regarding the future Locarno Treaty issue, stating that Belgium will continue to adhere to all obligations contained in the League of Nations Covenant, and therefore does not intend to return to the neutral status it held before the European War.)

After the outbreak of the Russian Revolution, the old woman fled to Warsaw with her two daughters. Before fleeing, she hid the jewels in the cellar. Among them is a diamond necklace purchased in Amsterdam before the European War, worth more than £75,000. (National News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Ship Hits Mine in Spanish Waters</h3>
<p>⊙Port-Vendres, France The British ship "Landuffanly Dye" (10,600 tons), carrying about 100 passengers and 127 crew members, was en route from the UK to Durban, Natal, South Africa. Last night, in the sea two miles from the Spanish port of Cruz, it struck a mine planted during the Spanish Civil War, causing a hole in the bow and water to enter. It urgently used all its strength to pump water and sailed to Port-Vendres, anchoring about half a mile from the shore. It has not yet been determined whether the mine was placed by the government forces or the Nationalist forces. General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, recently notified foreign governments that mines had been laid in all Spanish ports. French ships recently reported finding many mines off the French coast, so French warships began mine-sweeping operations last week to prevent ships from encountering danger.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Fengtai Eagerly Seek to Build Training Ground</h3>
<p>Kato Discusses Economic Cooperation; Also Knows It Must Be Mutually Beneficial to Succeed</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: After the Japanese army increased its garrison by a regiment in Fengtai, it initially planned to purchase land to build a large-scale airfield for chemical warfare and expand barracks. After repeated negotiations by the Hebei-Chahar authorities, it was stopped. Recently, the Japanese army in that area has purchased a large batch of bricks and stones, which are being unloaded in preparation for adding more barracks. It is reported that the Japanese army has not abandoned its previous demands, using the pretext that the number of personnel is larger and the barracks are not sufficient for accommodation, so they are adding barracks. And because the garrison has been stationed for a long time, they cannot be without a training ground, so they are preparing to find a considerable area of land near the barracks to build a training ground. Whether the land will be purchased, rented, or borrowed has not been determined. According to Kato, the Japanese deputy consul, "I have heard of the Japanese army in Fengtai planning to build a training ground. This is a necessary facility attached to the garrison area. The current garrison has begun negotiations with the Hebei-Chahar authorities, and it is hoped that a satisfactory solution will be reached soon." It is said that the authorities consider the training ground planned to be built by the Japanese army to be no different from a flying ground, and will continue negotiations to stop it.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, according to Kato, "The fundamental essence of Sino-Japanese cooperation lies in enabling the two countries to understand and recognize each other. However, this requires a medium to achieve the goal. Therefore, the Japanese Embassy is preparing to screen Japanese films next month and invite people from all walks of life to visit. The purpose of this move is to spread the true situation of Japan and to enhance the friendship between the two countries. In the economic aspect, we especially hope to cooperate, so that the two countries can communicate with each other, but there is absolutely no intention of aggression. Everything must be mutually beneficial to succeed. One-sided benefits may be feasible temporarily, but cannot exist permanently. In the cultural aspect, we are also willing to exchange and cooperate with the Chinese side. Mutual understanding will make it easier to achieve. What I am talking about now is all a principle." Kato also stated, "Although Sino-Japanese negotiations have been carried out on the issue of the development of the Longyan Iron Mine, I am not familiar with the content and specific methods. Li Sihao and Lu Zongyu have not met recently. Although this issue is being assisted by the military, it is mainly managed by the Xingzhong Company. However, both parties are not wealthy and still need to rely on capitalists. The amount is not small, so investors cannot but plan. Therefore, investigators come here, naturally continuously. The Chinese side must also benefit in order to proceed, so it is still under investigation and consideration. As for whether development will be carried out with investment, joint venture, or Chinese self-financing and the employment of Japanese technicians, it has not been decided. I think that as long as it is mutually beneficial, how the method is doesn't need to be discussed. As for the issue of cracking down on game rooms and gambling dens, it has already been implemented. Currently, illegal businesses have been stopped. However, those who operate them are like criminals in the execution ground, because of their livelihood, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not commit crimes again. Therefore, in addition to intensifying prevention, the aftermath problem for them has also been considered. We are currently studying methods and hope that the Chinese authorities will ensure the protection of legitimate Japanese businesses."</p>
<h3>The 70th Japanese Diet's "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back" (Continued)</h3>
<p>More interesting is the matter of Uehara Chushō intervening against the Ugaki cabinet formation. At that moment, Uehara possessed a spirit that would rival Hamada Kokumatsu. Uehara questioned, "According to the general public's interpretation, the collapse of the Hirota Cabinet was mainly due to the actions of the military. Later, Ugaki received the mandate to form a cabinet. We, the Seiyukai Party, do not know Ugaki's policies and program, but I think the general public held great hopes for the formation of the Ugaki Cabinet. However, Ugaki ultimately failed to form a cabinet due to the opposition of the three chiefs of the military. The reason for the three chiefs' opposition to Ugaki's cabinet formation is said to be that if Ugaki formed a cabinet, the military rectification work would be hindered. But General Ugaki himself is one of the generals of the Imperial Army. How could the formation of the cabinet hinder military rectification? I really don't understand this reasoning." The raising of this question is more about exposing than challenging. In reality, of course, no satisfactory answer will be obtained. So Hayashi's reply only said, "Regarding this question, it is not something I can answer. Moreover, this is not a place to answer it." Thus, all the members of the assembly remained silent.</p>
<p>㊂ The Budget and Tax Increase Issues The Japanese Showa 12 fiscal year budget, during the era of Finance Minister Baba, had already been submitted to the Diet. After the new cabinet was formed, it was withdrawn and revised along with the tax increase bill. As a result, the new Finance Minister, Yūki Toyotaro, reduced the total of 3.4 billion yen by 269 million yen. So the total amount of the re-submitted budget this time is around 3.177 billion yen. On the surface, it seems to be a reduction of about 8.5 percent, which is not too little, but the vast majority of what was cut - 150 million yen - was not military or any other provincial expenses, but subsidies to local governments. As for military expenditures, although the army and navy secretly agreed to postpone the payment of 23 million yen from the original budget to the next fiscal year, no amount was cut in the new fiscal year budget. Therefore, the questioning by Yamasaki Katsuo, a Minseitō member and expert in finance, was very interesting. "For the sake of easing prices, Yūki Finance reduced the budget by 269 million yen. The Finance Minister calls this the 'agreed implementation amount,' but the budget is submitted based on former Finance Minister Baba's original proposal. What should we use to review it?" "Looking at the current cabinet's revision, it can be seen that the demands of local areas to reduce burdens have not been accommodated, while military expenditures have increased proportionally from 46 percent to 49 percent. In addition to the national debt expenditure accounting for 16 percent, administrative expenses only account for 35 percent." "In Yūki's revision, military expenditures have become 80 percent of the increased budget for the next fiscal year, and administrative expenses only account for more than 10 percent. Now the army wants to continue to increase the national defense expenditure for six years. If this continues, will our country's budget not become entirely national defense expenditure one day?" "If our country really needs such a large national defense, even if the entire budget is filled with national defense expenditure, the people are willing to do so, but now is not the time."</p>
<p>Next, Kawasaki questioned Yūki separately on issues such as Yūki's tax increase bill, countermeasures against rising prices, public bond digestion capacity, and trade policy. Finally, he asked Yūki to reply on what view he had of the future of Japanese finance. Yūki's reply was, "Frankly speaking, I really can't see through the future of our country's finances."</p>
<p>The audience couldn't help but laugh when they heard such an unexpected and bold answer, but it was clearly not a malicious laugh, and someone said, "Based on Yūki's sincere attitude, he can pass the minister's exam." At the same time, the sound of applause was very loud. We in the audience felt very moved. What was moving was that Yūki, the only financial expert of this caliber in Japan, could not instill the slightest confidence in the current Japanese finances, completely admitting the blindness of financial policy. At the same time, the so-called national representatives of Japan could not but welcome him in this financial fog that "can't be seen through." After all, the "iron fate" of capitalism cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>After Yūki's response, Kawasaki went on to say, "The Finance Minister said just now that he can't see through the future of finance, and I feel satisfied with this attitude. But isn't the reason why he can't see through because he can't see through the military expenditures at all? Now I want to ask the Minister of War whether he can reduce military expenditures for the healthy development of the national economy." In response to this question, Yūki first replied, "The Ministry of Finance is certainly not in a position of opposition to the military, but it is not following the military, but moving forward together." Then, War Minister Sugiyama Gen took the stage to reply. Sugiyama could tell at a glance that he was a person without parliamentary experience. The attitude of a soldier was fully expressed. "Currently, the Soviet Union has fifteen or sixteen divisions in the Far East, and has a number of planes and tanks equivalent to this number. However, on our side, there are only the Tokyo and Kurume divisions, and the planes and tanks are also extremely inferior. This is evidence of the incompleteness of national defense capabilities. This budget, no matter what you say, is necessary and indispensable. You all must also have a deeper understanding of national defense."</p>
<p>Such a counterattack was something that even the newspapers on the second day could not condone, and they secretly felt injustice for the political parties. But at that time, the party gentlemen in the parliament only heard them shout "This is not a threat." In addition, some people responded with applause.</p>
<h3>5. The Sentiment of "Defeatism"</h3>
<p>In the 70th Japanese Diet, although the established political parties were quite prominent, they ultimately did not have the determination to fight to the end. As a result of being allocated by the timid sentiment of "defeatism", they only succumbed and made concessions to the cabinet they criticized and were dissatisfied with, and the hard labor behind it. On February 17, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun editorial said that this Diet "has become a simple machine for applauding the government's speeches," which can be said to be a single phrase that penetrates the truth. In fact, Hamada Kokumatsu's heroic words only earned a cabinet that rejected party participation. The questions of Koizumi and Uehara only exposed the sorrow that these questions themselves did not have the determination to act on them. The result of Kawasaki's questioning was to make a Finance Minister who admitted that he could not see through the future of finance receive a warm welcome, and it also came with a lesson from the new Minister of War.</p>
<p>"One step forward, two steps back," I never thought that it would be applicable to the Japanese Diet today. (Central News Agency, February 17) (End)</p>
<h3>Taiwanese Residing in Quanzhou</h3>
<p>General Investigation of Quanzhou City and Jinjiang South; Many Are Doctors, Actions Worth Noting</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: In addition to the approximately 17,000 to 18,000 registered and unregistered Japanese nationals from Taiwan residing in Southern Fujian, in Xiamen, in the past two or three years, many of them have also moved from Xiamen to inland areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou to reside, especially near the sea in the Quanzhou area. However, due to the lack of registration, there are no official statistics. The following is a record of the Taiwanese residing in Quanzhou City and Jinjiang South: ㊀ Quanzhou City: Doctors Zheng Wenren, Zheng Qingyu, Zheng Jinfeng, Xu Jingqing, ophthalmologist Guo Hanhai, pediatrician Yan Jintao, doctors Li Jinsong, Chen Xigang, dentists Huang Guorui, Su Shurong, doctors Lin Maoqi, Huang Yongquan, Lin Yingbin, Xu Kunrong, Cai Binghui, obstetrician Qian Xiubi, prostitutes Baofeng Ailian, Yuqing, machine factory Jiang Wenbiao, Feng Jiao, the concubine of Zhou Binggou, the superintendent of the Shunzhou Office of Jinjiang County, also resides in Hong Dunying on Xinmenhou Street, and Xu Kunrong in Wubu. ㊁ Qingyang Town: Doctors Zhu Guanghui, Hou Dingbang, Wei Jinyan, Lin Shumei, Liu Daorong, Liu Shihuang, Liu Rongchun, Huang Hanyue, dentist Li Zezhou. ㊂ Shishi Town: Doctors Deng Bingren, Lin Shengshan, Hou Dingbang, Zhuang Tianhe, Su Hongshu, Zhuang Qinghuang, Chen Zhenyi, Li Shurong, Guo Ruhou, Zhou Yanshe, Li Guoxing, Zhu Tenghui, Wang Xianzhang, Zeng Jianling, Su Wanrong, pediatrician Zeng Shuitian, obstetrician Lu Shuiqia, gynecologist Ke Wanzhen, general practitioner Wang Shenfu, doctors Chen Zhenchou, Yang Youming, Wang Xianbiao, Lu Shuqiong. ㊃ Anhai Town: Doctors Deng Xinde, Cheng Desheng, Huang Ying, dentist Huang Guanghui, doctors Ye Fengchun, Zhang Zhaoming, Chen Zhenming, dentist Huang Birong, doctors Zhuang Yuenan, Chen Chongrong, Su Zeqin. ㊄ Yongning Town: Doctor Gao Chixian, dentist Shi Kunyu, ophthalmologists Chen Zhenyi, Yan Caixiang, general practitioner Lu Fengchang, dentist Li Guoming. ㊅ Jinjing Town: Doctors Chen Ruzhou, Deng Binghui, Su Jinde, Wang Hanlin, Ke Bixia, Chen Yongyu, also Zheng Shuying. ㊆ Guanqiao Town: Doctors Zeng Guangming, Gao Deqin, Wu Guanghui. ㊇ Cizao Township: Doctors Cao Guangming, Wu Yixiang, and Wu Yixiang's father. ㊈ Neikeng Township: Doctor Wu Baifu, quack doctor Chen Pihui. The above investigation is inevitably incomplete. There are also many people in the Shenhu, Guan, and Weikou areas, and those engaged in other occupations, who require a more accurate investigation to be detailed. These Taiwanese have moved in independently and successively in the past two or three years. It was only after they had been residing for a long time that they were discovered. According to the above record, most of them are doctors. Given the population of Quanzhou and Jinjiang South, there seems to be no need to add so many doctors in addition to the original doctors. The doctor profession is very easy to contact in many ways, so their actions are quite noteworthy. In January of this year, the Quanzhou garrison met with various counties to investigate and report on local foreign nationals and to crack down on the activities of traitors. This is also to prevent problems before they occur. (February 24)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Police Station Cracks Down on Stolen Goods</p>
<p>The county's water police team arrested eight bandits, including Shi Shungui and Chen Asan, in the Songjiang and Shanghai areas, and recovered many stolen goods.

Reports stated that two stolen boats and other stolen goods were found at Cao Yougen's home, and Cao Yougen's wife, Zhang, was arrested for questioning. Shi Zhan confessed that there were still a large number of stolen goods hidden at the home of her accomplice Li Yaozeng in front of the Fangta in the city, and that her accomplice Lu Atao was also related to various theft cases. On December 26 last year, she robbed Yang Mazizi's home on the Huangpu Bund, and Lu Atao also received seven yuan in stolen money, and is currently hiding near Xiguofu in Caihuajing in the city. Patrol officer Yang verified the confession, and sent detectives Chen Kunsheng and Tan Nanrong to Li Yaozeng's home with Shi Zhan to recover many stolen goods, and returned to Cao Zhang's home to recover stolen goods, and all were sent to the station. Later, near Xiyuan, he planned to arrest Lu Atao, who happened to be walking by. Shi Zhan identified him and arrested him. They are currently being detained in the station for interrogation. It is reported that the water police team has also captured many thieves and stolen goods. Most of the thieves around the city are doing this.</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Recent Drop of Four Yuan in Flour</p>
<p>Rumors of Australian Wheat Definite</p>
<p>Factory Multiple Short Positions Unloaded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market witnessed a uniform and sharp decline across all months. Compared to the previous two days, the quoted price for foreign wheat also fell slightly. Although this month has passed, there were 50,000 to 60,000 bags of small factory goods for delivery. The previous rumor of Australian wheat being confirmed for over 8,000 tons also contributed to market uncertainty. Outside investors aggressively sold, causing prices to fall by two to three cents. The afternoon opening saw factory short sales and large investors unloading substantial quantities, leading to repeated sharp declines. Both March and April contracts fell by four yuan, while the July contract, due to favorable weather and confirmed foreign wheat, also experienced a sharp decline. If sales in the coming month do not improve, further weakness is anticipated.</p>
<p>The margin for each month's flour futures will be adjusted to 250 yuan per 1,000 bags, effective March 1st. This has been announced to the market.</p>
<p>Spring Revival, Wheat Market Recovers Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw limited activity due to slight weakness in foreign wheat and favorable weather conditions. Prices rose slightly by three to five cents. However, the afternoon opening saw confirmed reports of foreign wheat orders and a significant drop in the flour market, causing widespread apprehension. Selling pressure increased sharply, with prices continuing to fall by five to six cents. The April contract weakened further, experiencing a significant drop of 13 cents. Industry insiders speculate that if the new wheat crop develops well, the long-term market may gradually weaken. The current wheat market has seen a sharp decline in standard prices, with each grade falling by five to six cents. Bengbu wheat opened at 6.61 yuan, Yaowan Yanghe wheat at 6.60 yuan, Tiantai wheat at 6.55 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 6.556 yuan, and Shaoxing wheat at 6.48 yuan. Shen Da purchased 3,000 bags, and Fufeng and Fuxin each purchased 2,500 bags.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil Cake Market Also Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, both the oil and bean markets continued to lack vigor. While spot sales of soybean cakes were active, abundant inventories held by both local and external buyers and scheduled deliveries at the end of the month contributed to market uncertainty. The closing price for February and March contracts fell by 2.5 cents, while long-term contracts experienced a smaller decline of one to two cents. Soybean futures for the current month are already in the delivery phase, with long-term stockpiling weak and traders continuing to sell. The March contract fell by five cents, while long-term contracts experienced a decline of two to three cents. While the continuous decline in oil futures has slowed, sentiment remains weak, with recent contracts falling by five cents and long-term contracts falling by 15 to 25 cents.</p>
<p>Most of the Rice Shipped to Guangdong</p>
<p>Recently, shipments of early rice have been very strong, ranging from 10,000 to 23,000 bags per day, with many more on the way. As a result, sellers are eager to unload their goods and are even selling at reduced prices. While Guangdong buyers have a strong appetite, the market is weak, and if sales to Guangdong decline, prices will likely fall again. Yesterday, a total of 25,000 to 26,000 bags of various types of rice were sold, with 18/10 going to Guangdong, 2/10 to the local market, and only a small amount to Xiamen and Shantou. This total included 9,500 bags of Jiangxi rice, 5,407 bags of Hunan rice, 4,000 bags of Han rough rice, and 2,500 bags of Wenzhou early rice.</p>
<p>Outlook for Rice Market Remains Uncertain</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals from various sources totaled approximately 27 or 28 boats, carrying a total of 5,600 to 5,700 bags, mostly thin rice. With the weather clearing up, sentiment has weakened, and local sales are sluggish, with buyers remaining unenthusiastic. Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, Xi'an, and other buyers only purchased slightly over 1,000 bags, resulting in a soft market. As a result, high-quality glutinous rice prices have fallen significantly, while thin rice prices have softened slightly. The future outlook remains uncertain. Duyang pointy rice is weak, with poor sales and reduced demand.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) While the number of boats arriving from various routes downriver has been limited recently, sluggish sales have resulted in approximately 200 boats accumulated downriver. Yesterday, about 20 boats arrived, and market transactions remained weak. The price of high-quality white glutinous rice has fallen by about 10 cents, while lower-quality rice has fallen by six to seven cents. Top-quality thin rice is holding its own, but medium and lower qualities have softened by several cents. Early rice is weak, with Yang Du Bu Ke pointy rice prices falling by five to six cents, and prices for other rice types also softening.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Overview of Yarn and Cotton Delivery</p>
<p>Quantity Greatly Increased</p>
<p>The yarn futures contract for February, launched on September 1st of last year, was priced at 199.7 yuan. At this time, new cotton was entering the market, and with a bountiful harvest of both domestic and foreign cotton, cotton prices were expected to decline, placing significant pressure on the market. There was some fluctuation around the 200 yuan mark. Yarn warehouses held substantial inventories. As autumn arrived, China's agricultural products had a good harvest, autumn sales gradually improved, and the purchasing power of various buyers increased, leading to active cloth transactions. Yarn factories, facing operational difficulties, had suspended operations and reduced production in July and August, resulting in a sharp reduction in cotton yarn production. Speculators seized the opportunity, and buying interest intensified, driving up prices. New highs were repeatedly reached. On October 19th, short-term contracts surged by 8.8 yuan, triggering a trading halt. However, yarn sales remained robust. On December 1st, there was another trading halt due to another surge. Recently, due to Indian merchants controlling deliveries, the highest price reached was 257.5 yuan. However, most industry players worked hard to deliver, with approximately 31,000 bags delivered. This large-scale delivery of bulk contracts set a new record for the exchange. The final closing price was 257 yuan, a sharp increase of 57.3 yuan compared to the launch price. The remaining contracts awaiting delivery totaled 34,500 bags, a significant increase of 20,750 bags compared to the previous month. The delivery price, calculated based on the average of the last three days, was 255 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan compared to the previous month. The delivered yarn included 10-count, 20-count, and 16-count yarn, totaling 30,750 bags. Most of the receiving parties were long-term companies. The brokerage firms and amounts received and delivered are listed below (in bags).</p>
<p>The cotton futures contract for February was launched on September 1st of last year, priced at 38.9 yuan. At this time, Chen Hua's short squeeze had failed. Domestic cotton fields had significantly increased, rainfall was favorable, and the harvest was abundant. The Cotton Industry Statistical Association announced that the national cotton production was estimated to be over 16 million dan, more than double the previous year's production. US cotton production was also estimated to increase. As a result, speculators flocked to the market, and prices weakened. However, the surge in the yarn market pulled the cotton market into a favorable situation, breaking through the 40 yuan level. The highest point reached was 45 yuan. Recently, due to oversupply and sufficient deliveries, the final closing price was 42.6 yuan, an increase of 3.7 yuan compared to the launch price. The remaining contracts awaiting delivery totaled 49,000 dan, an increase of 7,500 dan compared to the previous month. The delivered cotton was mostly fine velvet cotton. The brokerage firms and amounts received and delivered are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Sales Remain Sustainable</p>
<p>Current Cotton Mill Demand Remains Normal</p>
<p>The standard yarn and cotton market has suspended trading as it will be settling contracts at the end of the month. However, spot traders are still operating in the market. Spot yarn sales remain sustainable, with Yunnan buyers maintaining strong demand for coarse yarn, stabilizing sentiment. The long positions are currently working to transport and sell the large amount of cotton yarn delivered for the February contract and are willing to compromise on prices. Yesterday, warehouse yarn sales reached 395 bales. Based on this, the March yarn contract still has the potential to rise. A total of 674 bales were purchased, with prices similar to the previous day. 20-count Double Horse, Red Man, and Clock yarn prices were slightly firm. The purchase amounts by various buyers are listed below.</p>
<p>The cotton market is stable, but current cotton consumption at the mills remains normal. Only Japanese mills are purchasing slightly. There have been no reports of arrivals at the docks.</p>
<p>Hankou Cotton Market Transactions Listless</p>
<p>(Hankou Express News) The cotton situation in the city is listless and lacks vigor. Both domestic arrivals and demand from various parties are normal. Transactions between buyers and sellers are purely for last year's inventory. Shanghai buyers are weak and few are listed on the market, but factories such as Fuxing and Dacheng yarn factories and Japanese companies such as Tongan East Cotton Co. all have considerable absorption. However, its sales volume is narrow. A total of 45,098 city dan were transacted. The market price is generally stable, with fine velvet cotton at 42 yuan and coarse velvet cotton at 36.6 yuan (both per city catty).</p>
<p>In View of the Sharp Rise in Wartime Materials</p>
<p>There Are New Buyers for US Chen Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened with active trading. Due to good news from Liverpool, domestic and foreign industry players bought at limit prices. A few outside investors also bought Chen cotton due to the sharp rise in wartime materials, causing prices to rise 2 to 6 points. Later, cotton farmers aggressively sold their production, and fortunately, the spot market was strong, so the current prices were maintained. The new cotton was weakly sold off. There was a little fluctuation before the closing. The spot goods rose 2 points, and the futures rose 4 to 5 points. British cotton spot goods rose 4 points, and futures rose 45 points. The Indian cotton prices rose initially because the stock market was strong, and then weakened as vacant users sold, and finally, after the Liverpool gang bought, it rose again. The Pingguo Er fell 0.25 to 0.75 Robi, and the Olmra fell 0.25 Robi to rise 1.25 Robi. The Bai Luoxi rose half of Robi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (25th telegram).</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 26th predicts that Bai Luoxi will be 222.5 Robi, down 0.25 Robi; Olmra will be 204.25 Robi, down 0.75 Robi; and Pingguo Er will be 178 Robi, down half Robi.</p>

<p>As Yarn and Cotton Prices Rebound, Cotton Cloth Manufacturers' Thoughts Are Firm</p>
<p>Damask and Printed Cloth Are Approaching Peak Sales Season</p>
<p>Wholesalers in This Street Have Already Set the Direction</p>
<p>The piece goods market experienced a gradual increase in sales of colored cloths from Sichuan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Henan, Fujian, and inland regions, with blue cloth being the most popular. Additionally, as yarn prices rebounded, manufacturers' thoughts are notably firm. Eastern piece goods and dyed blanks, fine cloth, and fine twill are approaching the end of the month when advances are due, and those expecting lower prices have already been selling in advance. Shorts and colored cloth houses have covered over 1,600 bales. Prices for cash advances have risen by 2.5 to 5 cents per bolt. Futures contracts for the coming month are selling at 5 cents higher than spot prices, and sentiment is particularly good. There are only limited amounts remaining for short-term deliveries, and few buyers for long-term May-June deliveries. Native Chinese factories and British firms such as Jardine Matheson still do not have enough undyed cotton cloth to meet market demand. Coarse cloth is in the shortest supply. Changzhou factories have a considerable inventory of fine twill, as demand from Guangdong buyers is not strong. Tianjin, Guangdong, and Yangtze buyers are actively purchasing coarse cloth, coarse twill, and fine cloth. The peak sales season for printed cloth is approaching. Guangzhong Factory has ordered over 100 cases, which have been fixed by wholesalers on this street. Small amounts of up-to-date poplin are being purchased from various routes.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>February Bonds Settled</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Securities Exchange had the February futures contract settlement day, so the bond market will be suspended for one day as usual. The total number of settlements was 22,230,000 yuan, of which 8,365,000 yuan was settled through the exchange and 13,865,000 yuan was settled by brokers. The amount of receipts increased compared with the previous month. The 35th and 72nd places received most of the goods. Regarding the delivery party, the 45th and 46th places were the most active. Because the state of the market spans the two holidays of the New Year and the Spring Festival, there were only 38 days of transactions. The show began on December 28th. As the Shaanxi Incident turned to settlement, the pulling power of the major households was extremely consolidated, and the market price gradually rose, becoming more and more energetic. The short users also felt quite tricky. Until the lunar year end, it was almost surrounded by the rising wind, and until the red plate of the New Year, people's sentiment was more high, and the rise became more intense, and all the unity bonds reached a new high that was not yet available. However, after the financial community's big households put pressure on each other, they began to fall back, but the market trend was still trending upward. The total number of transactions was 123,320,000 yuan. The list of settlement, delivery and number of transactions are as the table below, (unit: hundred yuan)</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>American Firms Need High-Grade White Filature</p>
<p>Yesterday's overseas silk market saw slight gains in both Japan and the United States, with New York rising one cent for near-term contracts and half a cent for long-term contracts. Yokohama spot prices rose two yuan, and futures prices rose four yuan. Shanghai's silk market was slightly more active yesterday. American firms and Western merchants transacted in high-grade white filature, such as Eros grade fine thread at 905 yuan and Zebra grade eight-three thread at 820 yuan. Although these prices were slightly lower than previous offers, they were still acceptable. B-grade seven-eight thread was priced at 760 yuan, and there were also a few transactions yesterday. A total of 123 bales were sold.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Hainan Red Opened Over 3,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Sugar Association's market was still weak. The spot prices for 24 coarse granulated white sugar, 22.9 yuan, and transshipped 7.4 yuan, were not transacted. The original price of East White has not changed either. In domestically produced sugar, Guang buyers opened Hainan Red 3,000 outsourced, priced at 13.35 yuan, down by about 3 cents. Xinghua buyers opened more than 100 Ming Jing packages, priced at 15.12 to 15.05 yuan. Quanzhou Red opened more than 300 packages, priced from 15.2 yuan to 14.2 yuan. The worst are only 11.67 yuan.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Joint Company was the last time this weekend to standardize the exchange of Guangdong sugar. A total of 420 packages of Shunde Factory's Five Sheep coarse granulated white sand were sold for 22.6 yuan, and another 110 packages from Dongguan Factory were sold for the same price. 200 packages of No. 22 were sold for 21.1 yuan, 20 packages of No. 16 were sold for 18.1 yuan, and 1,150 packages of red sand were sold for 16.5 yuan, for a total of 2,080 packages.</p>
<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Designated Price of Italian Tinplate Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Italian tinplate has been arriving in large quantities recently, but demand from factories and customers is unusually good, so the goods circulating on the market are still almost completely collected. Yesterday's standard price for 90-pound single-joined was 22.75 yuan, and 90-pound double-joined was 45 yuan, which was about 0.25 to 1 yuan better than the red plate. More than 1,300 boxes were offered, and it was reported that several hundred more boxes of goods that could arrive soon were also offered. However, according to overseas telegrams, the designated price continues to rise. The designated price for 90-pound single-linked is 22 shillings per box, and double-linked is 44 shillings, which is also about 5 pence to 1 shilling and 6 pence higher than before. Because the industry players considered the price to be too high and difficult to sell, there were not many orders placed, and transactions were less active.</p>
<p>More Than 400 Boxes of New Thin Iron Goods Arrived</p>
<p>45-pound thin iron, which had been out of stock for many days, arrived with new goods in more than 400 boxes yesterday. It is said that the opening price was 60 yuan, and it is said that 70 or 80 boxes were sold out yesterday.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Silk Industry and the Necessary Understanding for the Future (3)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xiaohe</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>From the above two sections, it can be seen that last year's silk industry was in a trend of initial decline followed by later prosperity. Therefore, the latter half of the year was better, but we still cannot be satisfied with it. In the first section, the author mentioned that last year's Chinese silk exports decreased by 14,579 dan compared to the previous period. Here, I would like to reiterate this point to urge the attention of the Chinese people. In recent years, Chinese silk has been increasingly squeezed out of the world market, gradually losing its foothold. According to statistics, last year's Chinese silk exports to the United States were only one-thirtieth of those of Japanese silk. In the United Kingdom, they were only one-eighth. Although they had a relatively dominant position in France, the quantity was declining. The reason for this is not only the fierce competition from Japanese silk, but also the various shortcomings of Chinese silk itself, which are also a major factor in its self-inflicted decline. Today, the theories on improving the silk industry in China are already abundant, but the author will once again briefly mention some of the most important aspects for the reader to gain the necessary understanding for the future.</p>
<p>A. Protecting Silk Merchants Should Not Neglect Silkworm Farmers. Japanese sericulture originated in China. With the help of science, both production and manufacturing have made rapid progress, developing to the point where it can be said to have reached its peak. Therefore, it is necessary to limit production to prevent silkworm farmers from suffering from abundant harvests and cheap cocoons. In terms of silk production, the quality of raw silk has been improved to occupy a superior position. Looking back at the situation in our country, we are far behind. Although the improvement of silkworm eggs and the control of cocoon prices have been implemented recently, and the quality inspection will also be tried out, the export silk industry may be able to turn around, but the interests of silkworm farmers will suffer considerable losses as a result. Since cocoon prices are controlled, silkworm farmers often cannot sell at good prices. Although it is important to promote the silk industry and protect the interests of silk merchants, neglecting the economy of the silkworm farmers themselves is a serious miscalculation. We have repeatedly heard that farmers have not only not profited from raising silkworms in recent years, but have often found that their expenses exceed their income. As a result, they no longer raise silkworms, and it is common to see them hoeing up mulberry trees. Therefore, the Chinese silk industry has not been able to achieve the desired expansion of production and has already encountered considerable resistance, which is worthy of serious attention.</p>
<p>B. Concentrate Financial Resources and Strengthen Production. One of the reasons for the recent failure of Chinese silk is the dispersion of funds and the small scale of domestic silk mills. Due to insufficient financial resources, simple equipment, mixed products, and low output of each silk mill, the cost is instead high, making it difficult for the selling price to compete with Japanese silk. Last year, the Wuxi Xingye Company concentrated capital, controlled the administration of more than a dozen silk mills, improved production tools, expanded silk production capacity, and reduced silk production costs, all of which were effective. This is a good remedy for the current silk industry in our country.</p>
<p>C. Standardize Quality and Regularize Production Volume. The lack of a consistent standard for silk quality makes it impossible for overseas silk users to predict its use when purchasing. The raw silk from factory A in our country often differs in quality from that of factory B. In terms of sales, it can only handle sporadic transactions and cannot handle large orders. In terms of silk production, the output is also irregular, often failing to deliver on time or to supply larger orders immediately. Due to this situation, it is difficult to establish commercial credit abroad and even more difficult to leave a good impression.</p>
<p>D. Study Buyers' Psychology and Suit Buyers' Needs. In today's increasingly fierce commercial warfare, studying buyers' psychology and suiting buyers' needs has become the most important strategy. Knowing yourself and your enemy is the only way to adapt to today's environment. What kind of silk products are most needed abroad? What is the most economical silk price? If we can know the answers to these questions, we can cater to their tastes, match their prices, meet their needs, and cater to their preferences, then silk sales can be turned around smoothly. For example, Mr. So-and-so from the Yongtai Silk Factory, after returning from an inspection of the American textile industry the year before last, immediately urged the factory to start manufacturing high-grade white filature silk with a uniformity of 90 points or less. As a result, its sales were very smooth. Therefore, although many domestic silk factories suffered losses that year, Yongtai was able to make a profit, which was not due to accidental luck.</p>
<p>E. Continuous Research and Improvement, Science Has No End. In today's rapidly changing society, those who cannot adapt to the environment will be eliminated by nature. In the silk industry, a dozen years ago, the sales of our Chinese Zhili silk and local silk to Europe and the United States were so large, but now they are declining. The use of silk in the United States and other places was initially based only on the thickness of the stripes, but now it is based on the beauty of uniformity. Recently, in view of the increasingly superior quality of Japanese silk, the United States will also raise the quality of silk used from this year. Perhaps after a few years, the most popular white filature silk with a uniformity of 78 points in the current market will also be eliminated by more superior silk products. Therefore, I hope that the Chinese silk industry will pay close attention to the improvement of quality.</p>
<p>Note: The above figures are based on the monthly silk statistics of the National Economic Commission and the Silk Improvement Committee. The unit is the legal tender price per 100 catties of silk.</p>

<h3>The Vocational Education Society Celebrates its 20th Anniversary and Expands the Recruitment of National Members</h3>
<p>Initiated by Wang Zhengting, Sun Zhesheng, and Others</p>
<p>Meeting Scheduled to be Held Today at the Pudong Building</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Vocational Education Society was established in the 6th year of the Republic of China. It has been around for 20 years. There are three major goals: First, to prepare individuals for making a living; second, to prepare individuals for serving society; and third, to prepare the country and the world for increasing productivity. Recently, because society needs vocational education very urgently, the Society dares not fail to work diligently in the hope of making a small contribution. In addition to engaging in investigations, lectures, research, publications, communications, and other work, the institutions it implements, affiliates, acts as an agent for, and jointly runs number more than 30. Based on the principle of integrating wealth and education, it strives to promote vocational education, do its best to advocate and promote it in society, and do its best to make suggestions and contributions to the government. Over the past 20 years, it has received considerable support from all parties and has achieved considerable results. However, the Society believes that there are many ways to save the country, and the promotion of vocational education is one of them. Bearing this mission, its strength is insufficient. Therefore, taking advantage of this 20th anniversary, Wang Zhengting, Sun Ke, Kong Xiangxi, Wu Tiecheng, Cai Yuanpei, Zhang Gongquan, Wang Yunwu, Chen Guangzhong, Pan Yueshou, Pan Gongzhan, Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Zhou Fohai, Yu Hongjun, Xu Xinliu, Li Zhaohuan, Wang Xiaolai, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Fang Yixian, Lin Kanghou, Guo Bingwen, He Bingsong, Tao Baichuan, Zhou Yichun, Zhu Jingnong, Xu Xiaochu, Shen Jiucheng, and other celebrities from all walks of life, more than 100 people, launched an expansion of the recruitment of national members in order to be universal, and have appointed Shanghai and provincial and municipal recruitment captains to carry out the work separately. Now it is known that the Society is scheduled to hold a meeting at the Pudong Fellow Association in the city (27th) to discuss all matters related to recruitment.</p>

<h3>General Situation of Shanghai Experimental Primary School (4)</h3>
<p>Special Report by This Newspaper Hu Zuyin Investigation</p>
<p>4. Teaching Methods</p>
<p>The teaching methods of the school can be divided into three types: (1) Individual teaching method is being tried out in the four subjects of Chinese, arithmetic, society, and nature in grades five and six; (2) Problem teaching method is being tried out in the common sense subject in grades three and four; (3) Whole teaching method is being tried out in all subjects in grades one and two. Now, the various teaching methods of the school are briefly introduced as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Individual Teaching Method: The purpose of trying out individual teaching method in grades five and six is:</p>
<p>(1) To enable children to develop self-learning ability, self-control, and step onto the first step of middle school life, and gradually seek to communicate the lives of primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>(2) To enable children to understand the purpose and steps of learning, and then learn individually in the process of exploration, and gain interest in learning.</p>
<p>(3) To enable children to develop their talents and make contributions to the group, and the motivation for learning comes purely from their own requirements.</p>
<p>The steps for implementing the individual teaching method are briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Compile an outline of individual homework;</p>
<p>(2) Guide individual homework methods;</p>
<p>(3) Refer to the teaching examples of each subject and compile another individual learning process;</p>
<p>(4) Prescribe extracurricular homework;</p>
<p>(5) Fully provide reading and reference materials;</p>
<p>(6) Compile individual investigation materials and conduct precise investigation.</p>
<p>(2) Problem Teaching Method: The purpose of trying out the problem teaching method in grades three and four is:</p>
<p>(1) To enable children to select materials in the living environment that meet their psychological and physiological needs, and carry out purposeful, planned, self-implemented, and self-judged activities, so that children's experience and self can be continuously reorganized and grow.</p>
<p>(2) To enable children to independently raise questions, plan methods, collect materials, and seek solutions in daily life, in order to seek communication between primary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>(3) Whole Teaching Method: The implementation of the whole teaching method in grades one and two is to break the past logical subject organization and change to using work units as the unit of learning and teaching, so that children can select materials in the living environment that meet their abilities and needs, and carry out organized, systematic, self-planned, implemented, and judged activities to obtain methods to solve daily life problems. Teachers can observe the needs of children's personality at any time and place and provide effective guidance. The school has compiled a work unit experimental plan, on the one hand, as a reference to guide the progress of learning and teaching, and on the other hand, to analyze and summarize the expected learning results as a reference for post-experimental verification.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Friendship Night School</h3>
<p>The Friendship Commercial English Night School, affiliated to the Manhuitang at Zhengjia Wooden Bridge Entrance, Minquan Road, has been established for a long time. It is usually known for its strict training in commercial skills and English knowledge. Graduates who enter the School of Business of Shanghai University have excellent results, and those who serve in society have increased their status. Among the teachers in this semester, in addition to Bachelor of Arts in Commerce, three American teachers, Ms. Sun, Ms. Shi, and Ms. Hai, have been newly hired to teach subjects such as English conversation, composition, and business letters. Since the beginning of the school year, enrollment has been enthusiastic. Students from distant places such as Pudong also cross the river to enroll. It is reported that in order to reduce the burden on students, the school has specially reduced the tuition fees for each level and set up an English business elective course.</p>

<h3>International Basketball Prelude Jinan and Xintong Meet at Shenyuan Tonight</h3>
<p>Both Sides Will Take to the Court with Their Best Lineups Starting at 6:30</p>
<p>Jinan University Basketball Team of the Tiecheng Cup Championship is the basic team of the Chinese team in the international basketball game. It was unfortunately defeated by Xintong in the Xiqing Basketball League, losing the hope of winning the championship. Not reconciled, the team took advantage of the remaining prestige of the southern expedition and specially invited the Xiqing Xintong Team (formerly the Pirates), which has won championships over the years, to have a friendly match at Shenyuan at 6:30 tonight. Tickets are 50 cents in national currency. Both sides will fight with the best lineup. The positions are as follows:</p>
<p>Position Jinan Xintong</p>
<p>Right Forward Yin Guiren Shi Guia</p>
<p>Left Forward Han Zhenyuan Lamu Jin</p>
<p>Center Kuang Yaoya Lan Yin</p>
<p>Right Guard Cai Yanxiong Pihesi</p>
<p>Left Guard Wang Nanzhen Kason</p>
<p>Referee Zhang Guoxun Qu Xilin</p>
<p>Jinan was defeated by Xintong in the Xiqing League because Xiqing is Xintong's familiar territory, and it is always invincible. The reason why the former Pirates were able to dominate for many years is because of this. Once in the Chinese Basketball Room (formerly the Laoshin Father Road or today's Shenyuan), the Pirates' edge is restrained and mediocre as usual. At this year's Shanghai Conference, Xintong knew that it would not be an opponent of the McLing Xin team and others, and acted hastily, just coping with the situation. At the same time, Jinan did not participate, so the two publicly recognized strong teams in Shanghai this year did not have the opportunity to meet in another place. Therefore, although tonight's battle is not a championship nature, it is actually a very meaningful game and satisfies the desire of fans.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the International Basketball Game will be held at the beginning of the month. The championship competition over the years has not been out of the United States and China, and China has repeatedly failed. The basic team of the two teams in this session is Xintong and Jinan. Therefore, tonight's battle is nothing less than a prelude to the international game. Watching this victory or defeat, it is not difficult to predict the situation of the United States and China in the international game this year.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Inter-Port Football Match</h3>
<p>Lin Depu of the Shanghai Team Against the China United Team Was Sent Off the Field</p>
<p>The Football Association Ruled that Lin Has Been Suspended from Participating in This Competition</p>
<p>Hong Kong Newsletter, February 13 (Lunar New Year's Day 3) The Shanghai Inter-Port Football Team played a demonstration match with the Hong Kong China United Team at Caroline Hill. Lin Depu, the center back of the China United Team, had a misunderstanding with Jack Walter, the center back of the Shanghai team, when fighting for the ball in the first half. Walter almost had a conflict. Later, the referee Smith ruled that Lin had fouled and the Shanghai team took a free kick. In the second half, Lin unintentionally made another mistake and was sentenced to be sent off the field and could not participate in the rematch. After the game, the referee reported to the General Association. The Emergency Committee held a meeting on the evening of the 22nd and decided to suspend Lin from participating in the competition within this session. It can be said that it is very unfortunate. Since the China United Team has lost this general in this session, it will undoubtedly affect its future in the competition for the championship.</p>
<h3>An Important Scene of the Western League Group A The French Business School Will Fight Labor &amp; Yier Today</h3>
<p>At 3:00 p.m. at the Yiyuan Stadium</p>
<p>Jinan Rakesss at Jiaozhou Garden</p>
<p>The important matches of the second cycle of the Western League Group A football competition have gradually started. There are two matches today, and the most eye-catching one is the battle between the French Business School and Labor &amp; Yier at Yiyuan. Although Labor &amp; Yier was unfortunately defeated by Socar once in the previous week, losing the opportunity to compete with the French Business School for the championship, this is the first time that the Labor team has officially faced the French Business School since it was transferred to Shanghai. Moreover, the two teams are both the best in the Western teams this season, and it is difficult to distinguish their strengths. The English army has higher hopes for the success or failure of the two teams today. Moreover, Jiem Walter, the cornerstone of the French Business School's forward line and left winger, intends to live on Hong Kong Island for a long time after accompanying the inter-port team on the southern expedition. The strength of the French Business School will be greatly reduced, and the forward line, which is known as a perfect match, has found shortcomings, giving the Labor team a chance to win. According to the association's announcement yesterday, Parker will be the center back today, Willie will fill Jiem's vacancy, and Jack will temporarily replace Willie, and there may be further changes. According to this lineup, although the attacking power has not been reduced, its defensive ability is weaker than before. Although this battle has nothing to do with the championship, the French Business School still has six battles to fight. Strong enemies such as Eastern China and St. Francis are watching eagerly. If it fails again, the championship may be given to others, which is also unknown. The other game today is between Jinan and Rakesss, at Jiaozhou Park. Tomorrow's game between Eastern China and the Western Police, Jia Youliang of Eastern China has declared that he will not attend the game due to the pain of losing his son. Therefore, the lineup of Eastern China's appearance tomorrow is still under consideration.</p>

<h3>English Football Circles Oppose the Dual Referee System</h3>
<p>The issue of a dual referee system for football matches has been frequently discussed in English football circles recently. However, most football clubs do not support it. For example, the famous Harkosa Football Club recently held a meeting where attendees unanimously opposed the proposal. They instructed football representatives throughout the province to oppose any such proposal. Their opinion is that the recurring disputes in football matches are due to the incompetence of referees, not the inadequacy of the system. They believe that the current system is beyond reproach and that any rash changes would not only fail to reduce disputes but would actually increase them. Furthermore, the argument that this system should be limited to professional matches is untenable, as the rules of football should not be different for different types of matches. If the system is adopted for professional matches, it will inevitably lead to changes in the system for other matches over time.</p>
<h3>The Jingwu Association Seeks Members</h3>
<p>The Jingwu Athletic Association (精武體育會), founded two years before the establishment of the Republic of China, is renowned for promoting China's traditional martial arts.

Currently, to expand its organization and reach a wider audience, it is holding its 18th membership drive. The opening ceremony will be held at the New World Restaurant (新新酒樓) at 7 p.m. today, welcoming team captains and members. Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau will deliver a radio address on the true meaning of sports, aiming to make the entire citizenry deeply aware of the importance of physical education. Renowned Shanghai musicians will also perform Chinese and Western music to add to the festivities.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Charity Football Match: World Games Team Draws with Western Union</h3>
<p>Result: 1-1</p>
<p>Attendance: 20,000</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Dispatch) The charity match between the World Games football team and the Hong Kong Western Union team for the benefit of the hospital was held at 4 p.m. on the 21st at the East Parade Ground (東較塲). The audience numbered 20,000. At one point, Da Dong Road (大東路上) was teeming with traffic, with vehicles coming and going in an endless stream. By 3:40 p.m., both the east and west stands were completely full. At 4 p.m. sharp, impartial witness Tang Fuxiang (唐福祥) convened the participating players to draw lots to choose sides. The World Games team took the north side, and the Hong Kong Union team took the south side. The formations of both teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Before the opening kick, the Western Union team launched their initial assault, and the five forwards advanced bravely, surging past the front lines. Lionar led the charge, passing the ball to A. Luke, but Tan Jiangbai (譚江柏) cleared the danger with a long kick. Huang Meishun (黄美順) gained possession, dribbled past the center line, and made a short pass to Feng Jingxiang (馮景祥). The five tigers charged straight up, forming a line of great momentum, after several passes, they had already reached the heart of the enemy's territory. Li Huitang (李惠堂), under the watchful eyes of the two defenders, received a short pass from Ye Beihua (葉北華), turned quickly, and shot rapidly, but he was knocked down by Costa, and the ball flew out to the right of the goal, eliciting sighs of regret from the audience.</p>
<p>The iron gate was breached. Shortly after, Lionar received a long pass from Gaoshan Nu (告山奴) and launched a fierce attack, with commendable short passing skills. After several trials, the ball fell to Woote (窩特), who took another shot at the goal, kicking the ball hard and low. Fortunately, Bao Jiaping (包家平) dove to catch it, averting the danger, but then Hu Shan (胡山) got the ball. Hu passed it diagonally to the left forward Gaohua (告華). The five tigers advanced straight up, and although the defenders fought bravely, Lionar seized an opportunity at the ten-yard mark to shoot quickly, sending the ball into the lower left corner. Bao Jiaping's dive to block it was too late. The Western Union team opened the scoring. After seven minutes of further combat, the first half ended with Western Union leading 1-0.</p>
<p>Reverting with a goal. At the start of the second half, our team's formation was slightly altered, with veteran Li Tiansheng (李天生) taking over as left defender. The team looked formidable. After the kickoff, Feng Jingxiang dribbled past Silva and made a short pass to Li Huitang. Li led the attack, passing the ball to Cao Guicheng (曹桂成). Cao launched an offensive on the periphery, going straight into the heart of the enemy's territory. He lofted a pass to the left forward, but unfortunately, it was intercepted by Gaoshan Nu. However, our team's five tigers had already approached the walls of the city, not allowing Gaoshan Nu to take a step. Li Huitang, amidst the crowd, moved like a butterfly flitting through flowers, a warbler brushing against the willows, shooting fiercely from the ground in excellent form. The ball hit the net in the right corner of the goal as fast as lightning. Macris seemed to wake from a dream and shook his head in regret. The audience erupted in thunderous applause, with 20,000 spectators waving towels and hats in enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>A handshake draw. After the kickoff, the Western Union team repeatedly attempted to counterattack, but all three shots were caught by Bao Jiaping with skillful movements. Seven coordinated attacks were repeatedly turned back by Tan Jiangbai and Li Tiansheng. At one point, Li Tiansheng intercepted a ball from Xiao Gaoshan Nu (小告山奴) and passed it to center back Huang Meishun, averting the danger. Li then launched a solo attack, galloping through unguarded territory, but his shot from six yards out was saved by Macris, who dived to the ground. Feng Jingxiang also took a long shot from twenty yards out, but the ball went too high and missed the target. Before long, the silver whistle blew, announcing a 1-1 draw.</p>

<h3>Vice President Kong Discusses Party and Government Plans After the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>National Congress Scheduled as Planned; National Economic Construction Continues to Advance; Consolidating the Legal Tender and Supporting Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce</p>
<p>(Central News Agency) Kong Xiangxi (孔祥熙), Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, arrived in Shanghai by overnight express train from Nanjing at 7 a.m. yesterday. After disembarking, he went directly to his private residence on Avenue Road (西愛咸斯路) to rest. Before 10 a.m., he went to the Central Bank to handle important official matters and met with Vice Minister of Finance Xu Kan (徐堪), Vice President of the Central Bank Chen Xing (陳行), Manager of the Business Bureau Xi Demao (席德懋), Ye Zhuotang (葉琢堂) of the Central Trust Bureau, and Chairman of the China General Chamber of Commerce Du Yuesheng (杜月笙), inquiring about the financial situation in Shanghai. At noon, he also met with Wang Ping (王平), Director of Finance of Shanxi Province, and Li Hongwen (李鴻文), representative of the Shanxi Pacification Commissioner's Office in Nanjing, who arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, inquiring in detail about the financial situation in Shanxi Province. Around 1 p.m., he returned to his residence for lunch. At 4 p.m., he received He Jian (何鍵), Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, at his residence, listening to reports on Hunan's provincial affairs. At the same time, Ms. Hu Mulan (胡木蘭) also came to pay a visit, reporting on the state funeral of the late Chairman Hu. At 5 p.m., he went to the Central Bank to preside over the board meeting of the Farmers Bank of China. Afterward, reporters called on him, asking about the situation at the Third Plenary Session. According to him, four-fifths of the Central Committee members attended the meeting, more than any previous session. Everyone was gathered together, discussing important matters with great harmony. The solidarity among all parties was evident. The various proposals decided at the meeting have generally been announced. The most important resolution on party affairs was the confirmation of the National Congress to be held on November 12 this year. The convocation of the National Congress to pass the constitution and implement constitutional government has always been the party's position. However, due to the country's troubles in recent years, it has not been possible to realize this as planned. With this decision, especially with elections mostly completed in various regions, it is almost certain that the Congress will be convened as scheduled. Furthermore, the purpose of the party's revolution is to establish a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. Even after the National Congress is held, constitutional government is implemented, and power is returned to the people, the party will still follow the teachings of the late leader and, based on the principles of national salvation and national construction, work with the people of the whole country to complete the great cause of the National Revolution. As for political affairs, under the leadership of President Chiang in recent years, various administrative affairs have made progress. After the Third Plenary Session, the same consistent policy will be followed, with national economic construction as the center, and continued progress will be made. As the person in charge of finance, in order to quickly complete the great plan of national economic construction, I will dedicate myself to consolidating the foundation of the legal tender to strengthen finance, while supporting the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce to enrich people's livelihoods. In the short term, in addition to reorganizing the Central Bank into a reserve bank, I will also work to improve the organization of general financial institutions and consolidate their credit in order to increase the strength of national economic construction.</p>
<h3>Qian Xinzhai Talks About</h3>
<p>The Progress of the National Goods Joint Operations Company</p>
<p>(New Voice Agency) The China National Goods Joint Operations Co., Ltd. (中國國賃聯合營業股份有限公司), which was initiated by the General Association of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee, has established a preparatory committee and appointed responsible persons from the national goods industry, the financial sector, the General Association of Economic Construction, and the Ministry of Industry as preparatory committee members to actively proceed with the process. Details of the public offering have been published in previous reports. The company's capital for the first phase is one million yuan, consisting of two thousand shares at five hundred yuan per share. One-third of the shares will be initially subscribed by the government, and the remaining two-thirds will be subscribed by national goods factories and national goods companies across the country. It has been reported that since the recruitment began, the subscription rate has been extremely enthusiastic. Yesterday, the New Voice Agency reporter visited Mr. Qian Xinzhai (錢新之), Chairman of the Shanghai Office of the Preparatory Committee of the company, to inquire about the progress of the share subscription. He provided the following detailed information: The question was asked whether, since one-third of the capital of the National Goods Joint Operations Company is guaranteed by the government and two-thirds are subscribed by national goods factories and national goods companies, the company will be operated under official supervision and commercial management after its establishment. The answer was that the General Association of Economic Construction initiated this company to improve the quality of national goods and promote their sales and operation. The government's participation in the capital is purely to provide leadership. After the company is established, all business operations will be planned and managed by the board of directors elected by the shareholders' meeting. It will be no different from other purely commercial institutions. The government, in addition to exercising its shareholder rights, will not interfere in any way. The question was asked about the procedures for commercial shares subscription and whether there are any restrictions. The answer was that any national goods factory or national goods company interested in subscribing can obtain the articles of association and subscription form from the Shanghai office of the preparatory committee of the company at 125 Hankou Road in this city. The subscription form should be filled out according to the format, stamped, and submitted to the Trust Department of the Bank of China in Shanghai, along with a 5% deposit as subscription evidence. When the subscriber receives a notice from the company to pay the remaining share amount, they should submit it together with the remaining 95% of the share amount to the Bank of China to exchange it for a share receipt. The factories and companies that subscribe for shares must, of course, be those that produce and sell national goods and have the nationality of the Republic of China. For the sake of widespread participation, the maximum amount of shares per household is temporarily set at 20,000 yuan. The question was asked what the dividend rate of the joint operations company is and whether the dividend is guaranteed by the government. The answer was that the company's dividend is set at 8% per annum. Although the government does not guarantee the dividend, the articles of association stipulate that commercial shares will be given priority in distribution. Therefore, if the company earns a net profit of more than 50,000 yuan, the commercial shareholders can receive a full 8% dividend. If the profit exceeds 80,000 yuan, dividends can be distributed. The question was asked what the subscription amount has been so far. The answer was that since the company started recruiting shareholders, due to the government's leadership and the various conveniences that will be provided for the transportation and sale of national goods in the future, factories and companies are willing to purchase shares for the sake of their own business. It is expected that the full amount can be raised when the subscription period expires.</p>
<h3>Liu Weizhi, Chen Ce, and Others Wait for Yu Hanmou to Return to Guangzhou Together</h3>
<p>Negotiations on Investment in Guangdong; Departure on the Second of Next Month; Song Ziwen Will Again Go South to Inspect Qiongya</p>
<p>Liu Weizhi (劉維熾), Director of the Guangdong Construction Department, and Chen Ce (陳策), Commander of the Humen Fortress, attended the Third Plenary Session in Nanjing. After completing their official duties, they arrived in Shanghai by train at 10:20 p.m. the night before, staying briefly while waiting for Yu Hanmou (余漢謀) to return to the south. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Waiting for Yu to travel together</p>
<p>Mr. Liu visited Song Ziwen (宋子文), Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission and Chairman of the Bank of China, at around 9 a.m. yesterday to discuss economic construction issues in Guangdong Province. In the afternoon, he visited Central Committee members Wang Chonghui (王寵惠). Mr. Liu and Mr. Chen are waiting for Yu Hanmou, who is traveling to Hangzhou, to return to Shanghai before they travel south together on the President McKinley (麥金蘭總統號) ship of the Dollar Company on the second of next month.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu's talk</p>
<p>According to Mr. Liu, speaking to a New Voice Agency reporter, in addition to attending the Third Plenary Session, he came north to discuss Guangdong's economic construction plans with the Executive Yuan, such as the establishment of various new factories. He also made contact with banking circles in Shanghai regarding investment in Guangdong. Mr. Song (Ziwen) has a considerable plan for the development of Qiongya. The establishment of a food transportation and sales company to alleviate the rice shortage in Guangdong Province is also being managed by Mr. Song, with investment from banking circles in Shanghai. The company's location will be decided in Shanghai. Guangdong Province is rich in agricultural products, and if industry is promoted at the same time, the future is limitless. Therefore, I have great hopes for Guangdong's economic construction. As for the implementation steps, I will use investment from Chinese and foreign people. Therefore, one of my missions here is to raise funds for the construction of the Guangmei Railway. The regular expenses can be borne by the government, but the temporary expenses are more difficult to raise. During the Third Plenary Session, the five standing committee members of the National Economic Commission jointly proposed an economic construction plan, which also made the same proposals. However, the specific plan has not yet been drafted.</p>
<p>Song will travel south</p>
<p>A reliable source told the New Voice Agency reporter that Zhu Ziwen has decided to go south again with President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke (孫科) in the near future to inspect the construction of Guangdong Province and plan the development of Qiongya.</p>

It is said that the industrial inspection team is scheduled to gather at the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce before April 15, in order to jointly go to Qiongya for inspection.

Military medicine is an important facility in national defense and military affairs, and all countries in the world attach great importance to it. I am fortunate to be sent abroad this time to engage in investigation. I plan to go to the United States first, and then to countries such as Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. In addition to investigation, I will also widely visit famous European and American military medical experts and leaders to explore theoretical aspects and adopt their advantages to prepare for the improvement of China's military medicine.

<h3>The Real Estate Industry Asks for Reassessment of Land Prices; The City Government Disapproves</h3>
<p>Land Valuation Began After the January 28th Incident; Land Value Tax Changed to 7/1000 This Year</p>
<p>(New News Agency) The Real Estate Industry Association of this city, noting that land prices in this city have gradually declined since the January 28th Incident and the impact of the global economic downturn, requested the municipal government to reassess land prices to reduce tax burdens. Yesterday, the municipal government issued approval No. 4377, stating that the valuation of land within the scope of the temporary land value tax in this city began in 1933, which was after the January 28th Incident when business conditions were sluggish, even more so than today. The land value tax assessed at that time was already lower than the market value at the time. The valuation committee reviewed and approved the assessment, and in response to citizens' requests, the tax collection price of the land was calculated at a 40-50% reduction of the original assessed value. Regardless of the recent decline in real estate, it is still lower than the market price at the time of purchase and sale. The land value tax rate in this city, originally 6/1000, was recently changed to 7/1000, which has been reviewed and approved by the City Council and submitted to the central government for approval and implemented this year. The request should not be discussed. This approval.</p>

<h3>Biography of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek by a Japanese Author</h3>
<p>Describing the Greatness of Our National Leader, Already Translated into Chinese by the Hanxue Society</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a recent book titled "Chiang Kai-shek" by Japanese author Fujita Ishimaru, has been published by the Toto Shunju Publishing House. The book, written in a biographical style, describes the greatness of our national leader from a foreigner's perspective. Its style and insights are both novel, and the collected materials are very rich. It has now been translated by the Shanghai Hanxue Society and will be published and distributed by the Hanxue Bookstore. Because the original author mentioned "Chiang Kai-shek's greatness" in the preface, the translator named the book after this phrase. It is scheduled for release around March 20th, with over 100,000 words in total. Pre-orders are now being accepted. The original preface of the book is attached below:</p>
<p>Preface: Chiang Kai-shek is Great! This is my conclusion in recent years.</p>
<p>However, Japan does not have an accurate biography of him. Occasionally, there are some, but they are inaccurate and fragmented. I am determined to write his biography, constantly collecting materials related to him from both China and Japan.</p>
<p>Biography ㊁</p>
<p>Suddenly, the previous Sino-Japanese negotiations occurred, and Mr. Kanda Toyosui, the head of the Shunju Publishing House, urged me to complete his biography as soon as possible. When I had written about two-thirds of it, the Xi'an Incident suddenly broke out.</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek has indeed gathered the world's attention, and his popularity in China has gradually increased.</p>
<p>Some time before the Xi'an Incident, when I was writing Chiang Kai-shek's biography, a high-ranking official patted me on the shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Now is the time to praise Chiang Kai-shek. Haven't you been bought by the Nanjing government?" The Japanese misunderstand Chiang Kai-shek to such an extent.</p>
<p>I may not oppose the view that "Chiang Kai-shek is not worth paying attention to, and his attitude towards Japan is just a disguise." However, as Xu Daolin, the author of "Is Japan a Friend or an Enemy?" said:</p>
<p>"The Japan Diplomatic Times views Chiang Kai-shek with the same standards as Yuan Shikai and Li Hongzhang, as if unaware of the changing times. The Japanese have a great lack of understanding, and this is one of them." I think there is something to be deeply considered here.</p>
<p>Biography ㊂</p>
<p>I think it is better to encourage the citizens of the Republic of China to "strive and improve!" while promoting Sino-Japanese friendship, rather than criticizing "Chiang Kai-shek is not worth paying attention to" right from the start. This is the magnanimity of a great nation like Japan, and it is also for the sake of peace in the Orient.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe it is extremely important to remove all misunderstandings, constraints, and emotional arguments and write about Chiang Kai-shek, the ruler of the Republic of China, in a straightforward manner.</p>
<p>Standing on this viewpoint, when I view him as a person, I cannot help but exclaim:</p>
<p>"Chiang Kai-shek is great!"</p>
<p>Please look at his spirit and skill. In such a painful position, he has gradually completed the so-called impossible unification of China under various pressures from foreign countries! Isn't he a truly admirable figure? The Xi'an Incident cannot overthrow his position in China. He is still the savior of China and a target of worship.</p>
<p>Biography ㊃</p>
<p>Shouldn't we Japanese now look at the new China he leads with different eyes?</p>
<p>In order to change our perception of the new China, we must not only know Chiang Kai-shek, the key player, but also look back at what China, led by him, and Japan have done in recent years. This is why the author describes the Sino-Japanese relationship centered on Chiang Kai-shek since the Manchurian Incident in this book. The reason for the failure of the Sino-Japanese negotiations in Showa 11 (Republic of China 25) may also be found here.</p>
<p>This book is written with such a purpose.</p>
<p>When writing this book, I tried my best to read the literature in Japan and the literature in China. On this point, I am deeply grateful to Mr. Lai Fugui, who worked at the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun for more than ten years, for providing me with valuable materials from China for the author's sake.</p>
<p>Biography ㊄</p>
<p>At the same time, the author also tried to listen to the unreserved criticisms of Chiang Kai-shek from well-known figures in Japan, both in and out of the government, within the time allowed. It is a pity that I cannot reveal their names one by one here.</p>
<p>The completion of this book is due to the help of the above-mentioned people. However, the author's writing is only one-sided due to his limited knowledge. I hope for your understanding.</p>
<p>December 25, Showa 11, reading the telegram that Chiang Kai-shek safely returned to Nanjing. Author's note.</p>

<h3>Various Groups Suggest Promoting a "Civil Servants Use National Goods Year" to the New Life Movement</h3>
<p>Defining Goals and Engaging in Promotion, Presenting Results of Commercial Discussions to the General Association</p>
<p>The United Association of Chinese National Product Manufacturers, the Municipal National Goods Consumption Association, the Chinese National Goods Promotion Society, and other national goods groups in this city previously suggested to the municipal party and government agencies that they lead the various groups to designate this year as the "Civil Servants Use National Goods Year." However, since this name has a national scope, they specifically jointly suggested yesterday to the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association that it forward the suggestion to the General Association, leading all party and government agencies nationwide to implement it uniformly to facilitate promotion. The original letter is recorded as follows: We are writing to you because our country is weak and poor, which cannot be denied. The reason for poverty is the competitive use of foreign goods, which allows foreigners to massively dump their products, causing the country's wealth to flow out continuously, leading to accumulated weakness and stagnation. To reverse this, we must start with promoting national goods. Last year, various groups in this city jointly designated it as the "Citizens Use National Goods Year," but it has expired. After discussions, it was decided to designate this year (the 26th year of the Republic of China) as the "Civil Servants Use National Goods Year," defining goals and engaging in promotion. However, upon closer inspection, the name has a national scope, referring to all civil servants nationwide. Therefore, after discussions among the associations, it was decided to request your association to forward it to the General Association, responsible for promotion, so that the whole country can implement it uniformly. This matter concerns the promotion of national goods. We trust you will grant your approval, and we will be extremely grateful.</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce Held Its Annual Meeting the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Praising China's Unification, Improvement in Business for American Merchants</p>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce in China held its annual meeting the day before yesterday and elected new directors. During the meeting, the chairman, Mr. Franklin, reported on the business conditions of American merchants in China this year. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Newly Elected Directors</p>
<p>A total of fifteen new directors were elected, including: Lawyer A. L. Lyman, Lawyer Compsis, Warner Brothers' representative in China Bintou, Manager of the Nubo Company Boderway, Director of Warner Heden Company Carlebb, Ford Motor Company's representative in China Crow, Lawyer Franklin, Manager of East Asia Insurance Company Philimore, Manager of Shenchang Foreign Firm Gellinan, Manager of Hainingsen Foreign Firm Heckson, Manager of Texas Oil Company Raefeli, Manager of Citibank's Shanghai Branch Mackey, Manager of Kodak Photo Company Oberger, Anderson Electric Company's representative in China Bigio, and Stogmack of Chase Bank, among others.</p>
<p>Original Report</p>
<p>The chairman of the chamber reported on the business operations of American merchants in China last year, saying that business had indeed improved last year. This was mostly due to the stabilization of China's currency system. Other factors, such as good harvests in rural areas and the avoidance of floods, also contributed to the increase in business. However, smuggling in North China, the recent strike of American sailors, the Xi'an Incident, and so on, have prevented a complete recovery. China has now achieved unification, and there is no doubt that business will increase daily in the future. Regarding the chamber's activities, it can also be said to be competent. In February last year, the chamber strongly urged the American Seamen's Board not to reduce the number of American ships sailing to China to avoid affecting the business of American expatriates in China, which was ultimately successful. In addition, the chamber contributed significantly to the restoration of work by American sailors. As for future reform issues, negotiations are currently underway, including reducing telegram fees and improving the Chinese government's insurance regulations, among other things.</p>

<h3>Police Bureau Announces Shanghai Grand Theatre Case Still Difficult to Resolve</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Foreign Affairs protested the case of Italian sailors assaulting the Shanghai Grand Theatre, it has not yet received a response because the newly appointed ambassador to China has not yet taken office. It is reported that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Liu Wendao, our ambassador to Italy, to negotiate with the Italian government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a report on the Italian consul's reply to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the Italian Consulate General in this city replied on the last day of the term to the Shanghai Municipal Government's protest against the destruction of the Shanghai Grand Theatre by Italian soldiers. Although the reply did not admit responsibility for the Italian attack, it stated that the Italian authorities were willing to thoroughly investigate the case. The original text was not published yesterday, but the Shanghai Times learned from reliable sources that the Italian authorities did not make a positive admission in this reply. They are now waiting for instructions from Rome. They must wait until they receive instructions before they can determine how to deal with the demands of the Chinese authorities. It is also reported that the Chinese authorities must carefully consider the Italian authorities' reply and the police report on the investigation of the case before negotiating with the Italian authorities. Therefore, it seems difficult to resolve this case in the next few days.</p>
<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, it is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Government will send a letter to the Italian Consulate General today (the 26th), officially notifying the Italian authorities of the actual amount of the losses suffered by the Shanghai Grand Theatre.</p>
<h3>Foundry Industry Association's Letter to Fellow Tradesmen</h3>
<p>Regarding Continued Price Increases Due to Soaring Raw Material Costs</p>
<p>The Municipal Foundry Industry Association, due to soaring raw material costs and difficult business operations, decided at its eleventh executive committee meeting to increase prices by another one cent per pound based on the previous prices. In addition to publishing it in Shen Bao, Xin Bao, Da Lu Bao, and Zi Lin Bao, it also announced it to fellow tradesmen for compliance. The declaration reads as follows: It has been found that the business crisis of this industry has become increasingly serious in recent years. Although the reason is that the cost is too high and the market is declining, making it difficult to earn meager profits, most of it is actually due to the deep divisions among fellow tradesmen and mutual infighting, resulting in rare difficulties. Looking back at last year, those who managed to maintain their business with difficulty throughout the year were already lucky, while those who lost their capital were everywhere. At this time, when raw material prices are soaring and business prospects are full of thorns, this association cannot help but speak out for the sake of fellow tradesmen. This association was formally established in November last year. At that time, raw material prices were rising sharply, and fellow tradesmen rushed to report in a panic. For the sake of saving the situation, this association decided at the first members' representative assembly to increase prices by one cent to maintain costs. The assembly authorized the executive committee to formulate a uniform price list to eliminate accumulated bad habits and seek unity. At the same time, this association drafted a detailed rectification plan to be implemented at the appropriate time. Since the implementation of the unified price list, all fellow tradesmen in the city have happily followed it from beginning to end, and the effect has been quite remarkable. However, there are still a few factories that disregard the overall situation and secretly reduce prices to plunder the business of fellow tradesmen, and therefore imitators are inevitable, which is truly regrettable. All of this association's rectification plans have therefore not dared to be implemented immediately, which is even more regrettable. In modern times, with the progress of material civilization, commercial methods have also reversed the old habits of each acting on its own without asking questions, and focusing on organization and mutual support is sufficient to seek development. Otherwise, one will only be eliminated. The establishment of various trade associations in this city is clear evidence of this. This association, in response to the needs of the times and entrusted by fellow tradesmen, considers the welfare of all fellow tradesmen as the prerequisite for every action. All our members should deeply understand this and earnestly abide by it. Only then can this industry achieve twice the result with half the effort. Conversely, the future of this association is difficult to predict, and the future of this industry will be in an irreparable situation.</p>
<p>Since January and February of this year, Yangzi pig iron has continued to rise wildly, and the price has reached a huge 110 yuan per ton to this day, an increase of one-quarter compared to November last year. In addition, the prices of essential goods such as coking coal have increased rather than decreased. This association deeply believes that the soaring raw material costs are related to the cost of blood and wood. Therefore, it has been decided at the 11th Executive Committee meeting to increase prices by another one cent per pound according to the previous price to make up for the situation. The price list of the products used has also been revised and announced for implementation. At this time of unprecedented business difficulty, this association does not hesitate to repeatedly urge and guide everyone, entirely for the sake of the business of all fellow tradesmen. We only hope that all fellow tradesmen will unite as one, abide by the association's rules, stem this tide, and seek survival together. As of today, there is no room for further mistakes and repeating the same mistakes. For those who have been shortsighted in the past and have privately suppressed prices, we only ask them to have the courage to repent in order to atone for their previous punishment, and we do not want to pursue them further to show this association's concern for fellow tradesmen. If they still disobey this time and intend to sabotage, they will be a major obstacle to the development of this industry and criminals of this industry. Then this association will definitely not condone it and will punish them in accordance with the rules and regulations, and will jointly punish them with all the fellow tradesmen in the city.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Judicial Administration Issues Order on Lawyers Who Smoke Opium</h3>
<p>Public Associations to Investigate First, Those Found Guilty Will Have Their Qualifications Revoked</p>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that lawyers nationwide bear the responsibility of safeguarding human rights and should be clean and self-respecting to set an example for others and must not be addicted to opium smoking. Therefore, it specifically ordered courts at all levels to instruct local bar associations to investigate whether members are addicted to opium smoking. If any members are indeed addicted to opium smoking, they should be ordered to withdraw from the association and have their qualifications as lawyers revoked so that they cannot represent the people in court to defend them in order to uphold the law and discipline and to serve as a warning. After receiving the order, the Municipal Bar Association has conducted an investigation to determine whether members have this addiction in order to report it, it is said.</p>
<h3>Japanese Marines Conducted a Large-Scale Drill Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Japanese Naval Special Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai conducted a large-scale drill in the Pudong area starting at 3:45 AM yesterday. All armored vehicles, tanks, military trucks, and machine-powered bicycle infantry were mobilized, with more than 2,000 people, personally commanded by Commander Okawauchi. They were divided into green and blue teams based on the color of their uniforms to practice counterattacks. Their area of operation extended north to Hejian Road, east to Glen Road, west to Zhazhai Pei'er Road, and south to Yangshupu Road, lasting about three and a half hours until 7:15 AM, when they returned to camp.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Consults with Ningbo Gentlemen Residing in Shanghai on the Sufferings of the People</h3>
<p>Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association Collects Views Separately, Former Imperial Historian Bitterly Complains About Current Malpractices</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai received a letter from the Yin County Government yesterday, which was a transfer order from the Zhejiang Provincial Government to consult with elders on the sufferings of the people and matters that should be promoted or reformed. The association was requested to</p>
<p>Widely Seek Advice from Shanghai-Based Ningbo Gentlemen</p>
<p>in order to collect, verify, and forward the details. After the association forwarded the letter to collect views, it has received many petitions expressing their opinions yesterday. Among them, the points made by Mr. Gao Zhenxiao (note: Gao was a former Hanlin scholar) were particularly incisive in pointing out current malpractices. The association specifically published them as follows: I respectfully submit my humble opinions for your consideration in selecting matters. I am now honored to inquire about the sufferings of the people and matters that should be promoted or reformed.</p>
<p>Not Neglecting the Remote and Humble</p>
<p>to convey the sentiments of the people below. Thinking of this, it is truly the blessing of the region. I dare not speak from the perspective of the knowledgeable and powerful, but only from the perspective of the near and small, and briefly list the essential points. According to the key to governance, the first is to obtain talent. When talent is present, governance is carried out; when talent is absent, governance ceases. This is a principle that has not changed for thousands of years. Love what the people love, and hate what the people hate. If love and hate go against the nature of the people, disaster will befall the person. If you publicly love and hate to conform to the will of the people, you will gain talent; if you arbitrarily</p>
<p>Use Your Likes and Dislikes to Favor Your Preferences</p>
<p>you will lose talent. As for losing talent, there is nothing to say about any government affairs. How can the people be at peace, and how can customs be good? If one thing is done, a hundred evils will follow. How can we expect to lift a hundred wastes and achieve success? The people will begin to suffer, and then what reforms can be mentioned? Recently, the assistant county magistrate and those who govern, the heads of towns, villages, and districts, should be carefully selected based on their character,</p>
<p>Whether They Are Appropriate</p>
<p>Whether their reputation is convincing, and whether their actions are reasonable. The county magistrate must be held responsible for those who are successful in their work. All those who are recklessly promoted, selfish, unreasonable, disturb the people, rely on their power, act arbitrarily, flatter superiors, and unite with each other, or those who are mediocre and base, must be eliminated and strictly reviewed, distinguishing between good and bad, retaining those who are competent and removing those who are incompetent.</p>
<p>The Three Elders of the Han Dynasty</p>
<p>filial piety, brotherly love, diligent farming, are based on the Three Virtues and Six Acts of the Zhou Dynasty. Although we do not mark them today, we must preserve their meaning. The names of those who are selected as heads must be trusted by the people with their character and reputation. Then the county government will be managed and governance can be discussed. For example, in the case of cleaning up graves last year, each town and village did not start with mobilizing personnel to</p>
<p>Investigate. Instead, they Focused on Finding Graves to Dig. Floating coffins were left exposed and</p>
<p>Allowed to Spread Horizontally and Vertically. Old graves were dug up and divided up as a source of profit, causing people to wail and cry in unbearable pain. After the fellow-provincials in Shanghai sent letters and telegrams to the provincial government, they were able to rest in peace. The fellow-provincials association and the Si Ming Guild sent people to the villages to investigate and confirmed the evidence. In just this one incident, the people</p>
<p>Felt as if They Were Robbed</p>
<p>The suffering of the dried bones was even more unusual and unbearable. Grandchildren, fathers, and sons are closely related by nature, and the proper norms of morality, ethics, and education were almost completely destroyed. All this was caused by the heads of towns, villages, and districts. Where is the good or bad of the people? In short, governance lies in the people. Without the right people, governance cannot be carried out. The people are the foundation of the country. If the foundation is strong, the country will be peaceful. If the small things are not taken care of, there is nothing to say about the big things.</p>
<p>If the Near Things Are Not Examined</p>
<p>What Hopes Are There for the Distant Things? The key is to strictly review and check the men in charge in order to rectify the local foundation. This is a crucial plan for today. I hope that it will be adopted and implemented. Gao Zhenxiao's memorial.</p>
<h3>Preparatory Meeting of the Farmers' and Workers' Living Improvement Association Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Electing Preparatory Committee and Issuing Declaration</p>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' and Workers' Living Improvement Association, having been approved by the Municipal Party Headquarters for organization, held its inaugural meeting at the Zhimei Restaurant on Sima Road at 6:00 PM yesterday. Over a hundred people attended, including Zhou Funong, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, as well as Zhang Ding, Yu Yaoqiu, Yu Zhenhui, and Dai Yongchan, who serve in farmers' and workers' agencies and organizations. Zhang Ding, Wang Xianqing, and Yu Zhenhui served as the presidium.</p>
<p>Matters Discussed and Decided</p>
<p>㊀ Zhang Ding, Zhou Funong, Wang Xianqing, Wang Gang, Zhu Guilin, Yin Yong, Dai Youheng, Li Weixiong, Lu Yinchu, Yu Yaoqiu, Zheng Zhenchang, Zhu Shuren, Hu Yingchun, Zhang Chuqiang, Yu Zhenhui, Lan Simian, and Gong Yuting, a total of seventeen people, were elected as preparatory committee members. ㊁ The meeting place will be temporarily set up at the Zhonghua Road Youth Propaganda Group. ㊂ Individuals with rich experience in agriculture and industry will be hired to conduct local research work. ㊃ Dai Youheng will be responsible for drafting the association's charter. ㊄ Zhang Sheng will be responsible for convening the first preparatory meeting. ㊅ The conference declaration was passed.</p>
<p>Issuing a Declaration</p>
<p>The association also issued a declaration, saying that the warehouse must be full in order to know propriety and righteousness, and food and clothing must be sufficient in order to know honor and shame. Just as trees seek their roots and water seeks its source, how can we enable the people to know shame and propriety, and to achieve a society where things are not picked up and doors are not closed at night, if there is no abundance of warehouses and no sufficiency of food and clothing? Therefore, the foundation of propriety and righteousness lies in the people's livelihood, and the abundance of the people depends on propriety and righteousness as its precursor. This is an undeniable theory. Previously, Mr. Sun Yat-sen invented the Principle of People's Livelihood, and later, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement, all with the intention of relieving the hunger and suffering of the people, making earnest appeals, hoping to enrich the people's livelihood and purify the customs of the people, and gradually strengthen the country, so as to avoid international bullying. Today, our China has more than 40 million square miles of land, which cannot be said to be not vast, and has more than 470 million people, which cannot be said to be not numerous. In terms of land, there is a need for mountains, forests, rivers, and minerals. In terms of personnel, there is a need for agriculture, industry, commerce, education, and the army. Agriculture is the foundation of the country, and industry is the beginning of wealth. This is naturally our responsibility. However, production relies on agriculture, but farmers have never owned their land, and manufacturing relies on industry, but workers have never had enough food and clothing. Education is on the verge of bankruptcy, and industry has not been able to compete. There are starving people in the wild, and famine is everywhere. Thus, this land of natural wealth has become a land of poverty. Speaking of this, it is truly sigh-worthy. The colleagues witnessed the situation and deeply know that it is not enough to practice the teachings to resolve the problem of people's livelihood. The way to solve it is to first improve the living conditions of farmers and workers. Therefore, improving the living conditions of farmers and workers is one of the factors in increasing production. The colleagues have been serving the farmers' and workers' communities for many years and have always taken improving the living conditions of farmers as their responsibility. Therefore, there is the organization of the Shanghai Farmers' and Workers' Living Improvement Association. Now, at the beginning of its creation, we will use years of experience and research to gradually promote its realization: that is, to popularize farmers' and workers' education to increase their knowledge, protect farmers' and workers' health to increase their health, improve farmers' and workers' machinery to increase their production, stipulate appropriate working hours for farmers and workers to cultivate their spirit, improve the living standards of farmers and workers to care for their families, and promote proper entertainment for farmers and workers to please their body and mind. All of these are brief points, although humble and without high theory, as long as they can be put into practice one by one, and inferences can be drawn from similar cases, then we will be able to promote genuine coordination and the harmony between tenants and farmers. It is expected that the day will come soon. I am willing to offer my humble and inadequate opinions to seek guidance from the gentlemen of the country.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Second Category Notice: Chamber of Commerce Continues to Request Amendments</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, in order to request amendments to the draft notice for the second category tax collection, sent a letter to the Income Tax Affairs Office, stating: "Respectfully, after studying the various provisions of the draft notice for the first category income tax collection, we believe that there are places that should be amended, added, or deleted. We have already recorded the clauses and sent them to your office in another letter, requesting your adoption. Now, after carefully studying the various provisions of the draft notice for the second category salary and remuneration income tax collection, we believe that there are still places that need to be added or modified in order to be comprehensive. We have listed the requested amendments on a separate sheet, and we respectfully request your office to carefully review and approve the respective modifications to facilitate implementation.

<h3>Zhang Yulin Seduces and Rapes Two Women</h3>
<p>Shen Baosheng, a native of Nan'ao, who runs a weaving shop business, is 31 years old this year. His wife, Shen Baoying, is 20 years old this year. Through the introduction of Shen Yin, a woman of the same clan, who also works as a female hostess in the New World Amusement Park, she met Zhang Yulin, a 28-year-old Changzhou native who works in the Mao Quantai Wood Factory in Jiangwan. In the twelfth lunar month of last year, Zhang went to the New World to play and have tea, and after getting acquainted with Shen Baoying, Zhang immediately seduced her to open a room in the Anton Hotel in the French Concession's Xizilaihuo Chong. They then rented a house at the intersection of Six Horse Road and Guangxi Road to live together, appearing as husband and wife. Recently, Zhang Xiuying, a 25-year-old woman from Qibao, Songjiang, came to Shanghai alone to find her uncle and make a living after her husband passed away. She was staying in a hotel when Zhang met her and used seductive tactics. Zhang, a woman from the countryside, was lured by Zhang under the pretext of going to the theater and was also taken to the Anton Hotel for rape. Since then, Shen Baoying and Zhang Xiuying have been living with Zhang in room number six of the Anton Hotel. Zhang has been enjoying the pleasures of his double-barreled affair. After Shen Baoying began her illicit relationship with Zhang, she stopped going home. Her husband searched everywhere for her without success. A few days ago, she was accidentally spotted by Shen Yin, the woman who introduced her as a hostess, who informed Shen Baosheng. He reported it to the French police, who sent detectives to the Anton Hotel and arrested Zhang Yulin, Shen Baoying, and Zhang Xiuying together and took them to the police station. After questioning, Zhang was ordered to be detained and was sent to the First Court of the First Instance yesterday. Judge Liao of the Criminal Division questioned them. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Affairs Office, explained the case and requested an adjournment for further investigation before prosecuting. According to Shen Baoying's statement, the defendant came to have tea on December 16th. He said he had no wife, so I married him as his wife. The judge asked, "You have a husband, how can you marry again?" Shen Baoying was speechless. Zhang Xiuying stated, "I came to Shanghai on February 17th to find my uncle and met Zhang Yulin. I was lured to go to the theater and was taken to the Great World, then taken to a hotel and raped. I have been living there until now." When questioned, the defendant Zhang Yulin confessed to the seduction and rape. The court adjourned the hearing to March 3rd for further questioning and ordered the defendant to be detained.</p>
<h3>Wu Mai's Tragic Death: His Son Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Definitely Not a Death Over Love; Detailed Plans Were Made in Advance</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that lawyer Mo Mai was killed in Hong Kong last month, as reported in various newspapers. His son, William, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong after handling the funeral arrangements. When interviewed by a reporter, he said, "The outside world is spreading various rumors about my father's assassination in Hong Kong, some even saying that he committed suicide over 'love,' which is ridiculous. My father has been working for the country for twenty years and has had misunderstandings with the authorities many times, having been imprisoned six times. In 1933, he even divorced my stepmother and went to various provinces alone to work for national salvation. My father sacrificed his family for the country, and to say that he died for love is truly heartbreaking. Moreover, my father's assassination was extremely brutal. There were several empty wine bottles beside his body, his clothes were hanging on a tree, and his shoes were taken by the murderer. Other items, such as his watch and the money he was carrying, were not taken. It was definitely not a murder for money. My father was extremely healthy and could not be killed by one or two people. His tragic death shows that detailed plans were made in advance. Moreover, his genitals were cut off, which was obviously done to create a smokescreen. During my stay in Hong Kong, I originally intended to bring his coffin back to the south, but according to the Hong Kong Political Museum and the cemetery staff, it had to wait until the case was closed. The Hong Kong government has offered a reward for the arrest of the murderer."</p>

Sun has a friend, Qu Fengxiang, 28 years old, from Taixing. He used to be in a popular troupe near Xiaoximen and is currently unemployed, living in Sun's home. Little did they know that he was a wolf in sheep's clothing. On the night of the fourth day of the first lunar month, Qu took advantage of Sun's absence and sneaked into the bedroom, forcibly raping Sun's wife, Zhu. Sun happened to see it, but because of his reputation, he did not make a sound. The next day, Qu suddenly invited Sun to dinner, which Sun refused. Unexpectedly, Qu carried a cane with a sharp knife hidden inside, intending to commit murder. Therefore, Sun called the police, who took Qu and Zhu to the police station. After questioning, it was found that the case involved accusations of rape and the intent to murder with a sharp knife.

Recently, lawyer Gu and Zhu Yonghong were sued by Zhu Qingbiao, a 77-year-old man, to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court for false testimony and other matters. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Chuan Lin of the Eighth Criminal Division summoned the defendants. Zhu Yonghong did not appear, only Gu Jirong appeared in court. According to the plaintiff Zhu Qingbiao's statement, he was suing because the defendant Gu Jirong did not tell the truth. The judge stated that according to the recent order from the Ministry of Justice, cases involving false testimony cannot be self-represented and must be reported to the Procuratorate of this court. Therefore, the procedure was not followed, and the case was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Cantonese Woman Zeng Wangshi Sentenced for Abusing Maid</h3>
<p>Transferred by the Chinese Children's Welfare Association; Court Orders Custody with the Association</p>
<p>The Chinese Children's Welfare Association reports that Zeng Wangshi, a 34-year-old Cantonese woman residing at No. 15, Heng'an Lane, at the intersection of Dongyoutan Road and Gongbandu Road, has two children, a 12-year-old daughter named Zeng Cuisong and a 10-year-old son named Zeng Tianbao, both studying at the Ningbo Second Elementary School on Fair Road. Her third son is still in her arms. Her life is prosperous. Last winter, she bought a maid named Genmiao for 70 yuan in national currency to do chores. However, the maid often wet the bed at night, and the woman often beat her. Around the Lunar New Year, the maid's bedwetting continued, and she was beaten more severely, with bruises and scratches on her cheeks, which were noticed by neighbors. On February 17th, they reported it to the Chinese Children's Welfare Association by phone. Upon receiving the report, the Association sent case worker Zhao Jian, accompanied by Chinese Detective Wang Lianchen of the Aoshan Police Station, to investigate. The woman and the victim were both out, so they returned on the 18th and took Wangshi and Genmiao to the police station for questioning. Wangshi admitted to hitting her twice and said that she bought her for 70 yuan as an adopted daughter-in-law. The Huishan Police Station sent Genmiao to the Women and Children's Relief Association for temporary care and released Zeng Wangshi. Yesterday (the 26th), a public prosecution was filed. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the Police Station appeared in court. Judge Jin Shi questioned Zeng Wangshi and Genmiao together. Their statements were the same as those given at the police station. The court ordered Genmiao to be released immediately and placed in the custody of the Chinese Children's Welfare Association. Zeng Wangshi was fined ten yuan as a warning.</p>

<h3>National Merchants Bureau Strictly Prohibits Gifts</h3>
<p>Circular to Employees for Compliance</p>
<p>Since its reorganization, the National Merchants Bureau has spared no effort in eliminating bad habits. Most employees have been able to abide by the regulations and maintain self-discipline. It has come to the attention of the Bureau that a small number of employees are still indulging in old habits, accepting gifts, and receiving requests. Therefore, a circular has been issued to all departments, sections, warehouses, branches, offices, and employees of the Jianghai shipping lines, stating that henceforth, except for weddings and funerals, which should be handled in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for Eliminating Wasteful Spending on Weddings, Funerals, and Birthday Banquets for Civil Servants," all gifts are absolutely prohibited. The original text of the circular is extracted below: "This Bureau has issued separate circulars prohibiting employees from giving gifts to each other and from accepting gifts from those who have vested interests with this Bureau, as well as the 'Provisional Regulations for Eliminating Wasteful Spending on Weddings, Funerals, and Birthday Banquets for Civil Servants.' Recently, it has been reported that most employees have been self-disciplined and have made efforts to eliminate these practices. However, there are still some who disregard the prohibition and continue to give and receive gifts. If strict measures are not taken to prohibit this, how can we rectify discipline and prevent solicitation? Therefore, we reiterate the previous order that henceforth, except for weddings and funerals, which should be handled in accordance with the above regulations, all gifts are absolutely prohibited. Even if gifts are offered, they should be refused. Anyone who dares to indulge in old habits and does not repent will be severely punished upon discovery, and both the giver and receiver will be subject to the same penalty, without leniency. In addition to separate orders, this order is issued for compliance and strict instruction to all subordinates for compliance."</p>
<h3>Bata Visits Chinese Shoe Factory</h3>
<p>Factory Presents Song Dynasty Porcelain and Ancient Embroidery; Bata Reciprocates with New Shoe Machine</p>
<p>Bata, the "King of Shoes" from Europe, arrived in Shanghai the other day and stayed at the Cathay Hotel. Many people visited him. Qian Chengxu of the China Machine Shoe Factory also met with Bata yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM to discuss the shoe market situation in the Far East and the United States for a long time. Bata returned Qian's visit at 4:00 PM that afternoon and visited the China Shoe Factory at No. 111, Grand Road, accompanied by Qian. They were warmly received by Qian Zewan, the factory director, and Chen Ziwei, the head of the business section. Bata was very impressed with the China-character shoes produced by the factory and said that there were many hopes for future business in China. If he had the resources, he would make beautiful Eastern-style silk slippers to sell overseas, which would be as profitable as making Chinese shoes. It can be stated with certainty. At 5:00 PM, Bata accepted Qian's invitation to tea at the Cathay Hotel, and also invited British tycoon Marshall, Smith, Beal, and Guo Bingwen, Director of the International Trade Bureau, to accompany him. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed after two hours. Bata has a strong interest in Chinese culture and art. Before he left, the China Machine Shoe Factory specially presented him with a Song Dynasty porcelain vase and various ancient embroideries to take back to Czechoslovakia as souvenirs. In addition, there was a large silver shield presented by the factory's staff, engraved with the factory's Chinese character trademark. Bata reciprocated by donating a new shoe machine to the factory, worth more than 10,000 yuan.</p>

<p>In the case of the robbery of Zhou Jinggeng, the compradore of Xue Mailuo's accounting firm at No. 9, Edward Road, French Concession, on June 9, 1934, at 4:00 PM, the robbers Huang Aying, Huang Xixiang, Wang Zhengji, and Fang Quangui, among others, were also involved in the robbery of property from the Shanghai Fourth Bank and three other businesses at No. 49, Bund, in September of last year. They were finally arrested in the robbery of the Yuanheng, Shikang, and Baoshen money exchanges in the Public Concession and were detained by the Public Concession Police and brought to the First Special District Court for prosecution. They were sentenced to imprisonment and were serving their sentences when Huang Aying and others voluntarily confessed to the robberies of Xue Mailuo and the Shaanxi Bank to the Tilanqiao Prison Warden. The French Police were notified and ordered the four convicts to be brought to the Second Special District Court for interrogation. During the interrogation, the police arrested members of the gang near the Slaughterhouse Company at No. 10, Ningfu Lane, and Jin, a resident of No. 10, fell and was injured. This was reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, Liao, the Chief of the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, ordered Huang Aying and the other four convicts to be brought to court for continued hearing. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the Police Affairs Office, stated that the case involving the second defendant, Huang Xixiang, was complex, and the third defendant, Wang Zhengji, was suffering from diarrhea and had been sent to the hospital for treatment but had not recovered. In order to thoroughly investigate the facts, the police needed to take the defendants to the scene of the crime for a crime reenactment. Therefore, the investigation procedures had not been completed, and a request was made for a two-week adjournment for further questioning. The court approved the request and adjourned the hearing to 2:00 PM on March 10th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Liang Shaojiu Industry Fined; Decision to Hold General Meeting to Discuss</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Liang Shaojiu Industry Association has been repeatedly detained by inspectors from the Shanghai Inspection Office, resulting in fines. The Association sent four representatives, along with Yuan Hongjun, a representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, to the Tax Affairs Department the other morning to petition for relief. The previous report stated that the representatives also petitioned the Consolidated Tax Bureau, but since Director Sheng had not arrived, Section Chief Jiang received them. The representatives stated that the Consolidated Tax Bureau was the competent authority for the private smuggling of liquor by deputy inspectors, which was of great importance, and repeatedly cited facts to request relief. Section Chief Jiang stated that he was unable to respond due to his position, which resulted in no outcome. It is reported that the Association will convene a general meeting of all members on the 28th of this month to discuss the aftermath. If there is no result, they may all cease operations.</p>
<h3>Dredging Bureau Continues to Dredge the West Section of the Wusong River</h3>
<p>Fifteen Li West of Fanwangdu; Invites Bids for Transporting Excavated Mud</p>
<p>The Wusong River, from the Huangpu River in the east to Yujidun in the west, is an important inland waterway for sailboats. Therefore, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau began dredging it in 1921 to facilitate water flow and prevent siltation. The scheduled</p>
<p>dredging period</p>
<p>was five years. However, due to the Shanghai War and other factors, the work could not be completed as scheduled. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, the dredged channel has already reached above Fanwangdu, but there is still about fifteen li to Yujidun, which needs to be dredged. Therefore, the Bureau has dispatched mud dredgers such as the Hai Li and Hai Bao to actively dredge in order to complete the entire project as early as possible. In order to</p>
<p>invite bids for transporting</p>
<p>the excavated mud from that area, the Bureau has issued a notice stating that the contractor must provide mud transport vessels and labor to transport and unload the mud from the Bureau's small bucket ladder machine ships to the shore. The daily mud transport volume is approximately 100 cubic meters (each cubic meter is 100 cubic feet). The freight rate will be calculated based on the actual distance of the mud dump. For more information, please inquire at the Dredging Division of the Bureau on the fifth floor of the Jianghai Customs. Bids must be sealed and marked "Mud Transport" on the outside and delivered to the Bureau by the morning of March 9th. The Bureau is not bound by the lowest or any bid. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Homeless People's Work Training Center Purchases Land to Add Workshop</h3>
<p>The Homeless People's Work Training Center in Caohejing Town, West Shanghai, was established in 1929. Since its establishment, homeless people have been sent to the Center for education and training by various agencies and local organizations. The results have been excellent over the years. Recently, the number of people being housed has been gradually increasing, and the original site is insufficient to accommodate them. It is also necessary to add workshops. The Director of the Center, Wu Tang, presented a request to the Board of Directors, who requested the Municipal Affairs Commissioner to purchase more than 30 mu of private farmland near the Center at a price to be used for construction to supplement the workshop. Commissioner Yang invited the local security to discuss the method of price purchase. It is reported that half of the land has been purchased.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council String Orchestra's 20th Symphony Concert</h3>
<p>To Be Held on the 28th</p>
<p>The Municipal Council String Orchestra's 20th Sunday Symphony Concert will be held at the Guoxin Grand Theater at 5:15 PM on the 28th of this month. The bandleader, Bei Qijun, will conduct all the programs, all of which are symphonic works. The fourth movement of Brahms is the most moving. This piece has not been performed in this city for a long time, and music lovers should not miss it. The other items, such as "Paradise Road," "Cuckoo's Call in Early Spring," and "Spanish Rhapsody," are also beautiful pieces. Seat prices are as usual.</p>
<h3>Renji Hospital's January Report</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital's January report states: outpatient visits, 11,940 people; new inpatients, 338 people; patient days, 8,205 days; average daily number of meals served, 440 people; male suicides, 37 cases; female suicides, 31 cases; emergency surgeries, 129 cases; emergency surgeries due to factory accidents, 52 cases; patients sent by the Public Concession Police, 267 cases; patients sent by the French Concession Police, 46 cases; patients sent by the Chinese Public Security Bureau, 18 cases; births, 25 cases; prescriptions, 12,278 cases; X-ray photographs, 354 cases. From the above statistics, a clear concept of the hospital's work in January can be obtained. Suicide incidents have decreased significantly compared to the previous month, which is gratifying. There are many cases of tuberculosis and other organ tuberculosis in the outpatient department, especially bone tuberculosis. The hospital's current facilities are not sufficient to meet the hospital's needs for relief, which is deeply regrettable. The nursing school affiliated with the hospital has now decided to register with the Chinese government. All the procedures that should be followed have been completed. After registration, graduates of the school can serve in other hospitals in Shanghai or other parts of China, and their careers can progress unimpeded. This is also one of the benefits of registration.</p>

<h3>Local Association Yesterday Hosted Principals of Major Middle Schools</h3>
<p>Visiting the Aid Sui Donation Exhibits, Huang Ren Zhi Delivers an Important Speech</p>
<p>The local association of this city yesterday hosted principals of major middle schools to visit the Aid Sui donation exhibits. Mr. Huang Ren Zhi also delivered an important speech. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Hosted Visit</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., the local association of this city hosted principals of universities and middle schools at the Pudong Fellow Association on Avenue Edward VII to visit the Aid Sui donation exhibits. Attendees included Li Zhao Huan of Jiaotong University, Wang Shi Zheng of Daxia University, Tao Guang Chuan of Jingye Middle School, Gu Yin Qing of Nanyang Middle School, Chen Ji Cheng of Shanghai Middle School, Cui Jian Wu of Daozhong Girls' School, Ji Da of Patriotic Girls' School, and more than a dozen others. Huang Ren Zhi, Huang Bing Pei, Ren Jin Ping, Wang Bo Shi, and others separately hosted the principals from each school for a tour. Many expressed their willingness to voluntarily take on the task of promoting donation gift tickets, ranging from one hundred to five hundred yuan. The association also scheduled a visit for principals of elementary schools this afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang's Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday, when asked by newspaper reporters about the recent situation of issuing gift items, Mr. Huang Ren Zhi of the local association said, "Since the Shanghai Local Association issued the Aid Sui donation commemorative tickets, some people have come to the association to inquire, hearing that the Suiyuan war has long ceased. Why is your association still issuing these tickets?" I replied, "The issuance of these tickets is due to the donation of Mr. Zhang Rong Chu, a member, who contributed many pieces of furniture, clothing, books, antiques, and other items, entrusting our association to auction them off, collect the money, and send it to the front lines of Suiyuan for the purpose of rescuing soldiers and civilians. This matter was still in November of last year. Unfortunately, the Xi'an Incident occurred. Although the board of directors passed a resolution to express acceptance and decided to issue commemorative tickets, it could not proceed temporarily due to the overall situation. After the overall situation stabilized, the board of directors stipulated a date for implementation. The common intention of colleagues is to aid Suiyuan. Although it seems quiet at this time, the situation in Chahar is still complex. The enemy's strength has not changed its strategy and incidents can occur at any time. It is definitely not a time for us to rest easy. Those who have returned from Suiyuan have recounted the plight of the local people being displaced and losing their homes, which is particularly distressing. Mr. Zhang's enthusiasm should not be forgotten, and the patriotic sentiments and charitable fervor of the Shanghai public can be clearly expressed through this. It is also a great good deed for national associations to encourage each other. Colleagues believe that with each expression of enthusiasm from all parties, the strength will be more concentrated, which will surely reduce the danger and suffering of the future overall situation." He was also asked, "Are these items of Mr. Zhang's personal property? It is rumored that the business run by Mr. Zhang has announced liquidation. Is there any relationship between these items and creditors?" I replied, "Mr. Zhang's letter to the local association clearly stated that the textile industry he operated encountered setbacks, and the economy was exhausted. Fortunately, the creditors were generous and accepted the mortgage for the company's debts, agreeing to an appropriate resolution for full repayment. Therefore, tightening his personal life, he decided to sell his Shanghai residence to repay private debts and move to the factory to focus on his business, donating all these furniture, etc." This is a very clear description of the factual situation, and it is understood that Mr. Zhang Ding's factory has indeed resumed. This spirit of struggle is commendable. As the ancients said, "It is easy to go from frugality to luxury, but difficult to go from luxury to frugality." Mr. Zhang not only expressed his patriotic enthusiasm but also made a great determination to change his lifestyle from luxury to frugality. This point is particularly rare. No wonder participants said that Mr. and Mrs. Zhang agreed to this, which is not something ordinary families can do." He was also asked, "Since the issuance of this ticket, what has been the impact from all parties?" I replied, "The impact has been very good. The items are displayed on the third floor of the Pudong Fellow Association at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, and the visits are endless every day. People from all walks of life in industry and commerce, as well as schools, have come in droves. In particular, the general family women are greatly moved. Some voluntarily purchase tickets, some introduce and assign sales, and some distribute them for sale. Approximately 10,000 tickets can be sold as scheduled. In my opinion, selling tickets is not our main goal. Through this matter, everyone in the city, young and old, can unleash enthusiastic patriotic emotions and be willing to sacrifice everything for the country and for charity. Moreover, because of Mr. Zhang's actions, everyone realizes that the luxury and frugality of life are not enough to move them, only sacrifice for national difficulties and striving for enterprises are worthy of public admiration. It can also give those in Shanghai who are accustomed to a luxurious life a great awakening. What a joyful thing! Colleagues have always done their best to do everything that is beneficial to the country and the public, doing as much as they can. Because we firmly believe that the construction of a new country and the creation of a healthy psychology for the general new citizens must start from bit by bit. Therefore, we often spare no effort to do one thing." The person greatly praised it and left.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Jiangxin Rescues Dashunkang</h3>
<p>Rice Retrieved from Ship, Suddenly Floating on Water</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Dashunkang vessel, loaded with over 22,000 bags of rice to aid the people of Guangdong Province, ran aground at Daijia Island, seventeen nautical miles downstream of Taizi Ji. Due to the ineffectiveness of the Jianghua tugboat, the ship's hull was deeply mired in the shallow beach. The Shanghai office immediately telegraphed the Jiujiang branch to dispatch the Junfa tugboat, along with two large barges, Yikang and Huishun, and eighty workers. Starting on the 24th, they began to unload the rice from the Dashunkang vessel. After a large portion was removed, the ship's draft suddenly decreased, and the hull floated to the surface of the river. Yesterday, the company's Jiangxin vessel towed the Dashunkang out of the shallows. The unloaded rice was reloaded onto the ship, which has now sailed downstream to Shanghai, preparing to head to Guangdong. As for the second batch of Jiangxi rice to be transported to Guangdong Province, loaded by the company's Dalinan vessel, totaling over 19,000 bags, it can also pass through Shanghai and go to Guangdong soon.</p>
<h3>Ramie Fabric Industry Petitions for Negotiation on Increased Taxes in Korea</h3>
<p>The Jiangxi Sojourning Shanghai Ramie Fabric Industry Guild, the Shanxi Sojourning Shanghai Ramie Fabric Industry Guild, the Sichuan Sojourning Shanghai Ramie Fabric Industry Guild, and the Shanghai Ramie Fabric Guild submitted a document to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry, stating, "Regarding the repeated imposition of heavy taxes on the transport and sale of ramie fabric to Korea, leading to the remaining sales volume nearing its end, we earnestly request a prompt negotiation to maintain domestic products from extinction and to increase revenue by even a small amount. The trading of goods is originally a natural need to supply the people. It is neither cunning to seek sales, nor should it be destroyed by political force. Our country and Korea have the longest history of commercial exchange. The amount of Japanese goods shipped into our country each year exceeds the amount of our country's goods shipped to their country by hundreds of times. Although our government has reformed tariffs and moderately increased import taxes, the original tax was extremely minimal. This was because on the one hand, we were considering the natural needs of the people, and on the other hand, we were maintaining friendly relations between the countries. There is nothing more thorough and careful than this. The Japanese only know how to benefit themselves. For goods shipped into our country, they only fear that sales will not be exhaustive. For goods from our country shipped to their country, they only fear that they will not be able to destroy them thoroughly. Strange taxes are repeatedly imposed, and they must disappear before they stop. What is more unfair in the world than this? Our associations are in the ramie fabric industry, and we are only speaking about ramie fabric. Since 1927, our country's sales of ramie fabric to Korea have been subjected to repeated tax increases by the Japanese government, resulting in the annual sales volume decreasing from over 6 million to only 1 million. The losses suffered by merchants are countless. Our associations have fully explained the situation in August and October of 1934, and have separately submitted requests to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Industry for negotiations based on reason. The approvals were (omitted), and the instructions from a certain ministry were the same. All are on record. We believe that when Japan's budget was not increased in the past, they still did not hesitate to repeatedly add heavy taxes on the import of our country's ramie fabric. Now that their newly revised budget is implemented, with tax increase plans, they will inevitably have more excuses to intensify their efforts to achieve their goal of complete destruction. Considering the past, our silk was sold well in Korea, but now it has disappeared. Our association is not alone in holding these worries. We have always admired our government's efforts to promote domestic products. Now that the deadline for Japan's tax increase is imminent, it is a critical moment for the continued export of our country's ramie fabric. We dare not presume to make this request. We earnestly request that you quickly negotiate based on reason, so that the remaining ramie fabric, which is already taxed at nearly 100%, will be exempted from further taxation, so as to maintain the natural needs of the people and to maintain friendly relations between the countries. This would be the fortune of millions of ramie fabric industry workers in our country, and it would also be a mutual blessing for the ethnic groups in East Asia. Is this feasible? We hope you will review and approve this. We anxiously await your orders. Respectfully submitted to Zhang, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government (the document to the Ministry of Industry is the same),</p>
<h3>Memorial Meeting of Licao Religion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai office of the China Licao General Association held a memorial meeting yesterday to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the revocation of the ban on Licao Religion. About 150 representatives from various public offices, including Pu Yusheng, Bao Zhishan, Liang Laiqing, Gong Changxi, and Wang Kechang, attended. Zhang Yichen, Dai Jinyong, Su Yongchun, Gong Xuequan, and Li Cheng were publicly elected as the presidium. Chairman Zhang began by reporting that the Licao Religion's public offices began with the first establishment by Master Yin in Tianjin, now known as the Xilaogong Public Office. Subsequently, branches were established in various provinces, with more than 9,000 offices to date. In April 1929, the Jiangsu Provincial Party and Government organs investigated and banned the Licao Religion public offices. Yichen made a plea to the Central Government for revocation. On February 26, 1930, the Ministry of Interior announced that the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 736 had been forwarded to the Central Party Department, stating that the investigation and ban of the Licao Religion had been revoked by the Jiangsu Provincial Party and Government organs. A major storm had subsided. Our Licao Religion community should commemorate this every year. Li Cheng and Pu Yusheng then delivered speeches. Proposals were discussed on the spot. ㊀ The 26th day of the first month of the national calendar should be designated as Licao Religion Revival Day, and a memorial meeting must be held every year on this day. The resolution was to request the General Association to notify all public offices across the country to comply. ㊁ The Central Government revoked the ban on Licao Religion. All Licao Religion public offices should erect a commemorative inscription to pass on immortality. The resolution was to request the General Association to notify all public offices across the country to comply. The memorial inscription will be drafted by the Documentation Office. ㊂ All members of the public offices in Shanghai should register. The resolution was to request the Shanghai office to notify everyone. The rest is omitted.</p>

<p>At around 10 p.m. the previous night, a wounded pedestrian was sent to the Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road, Zhabei, by Police Officer No. 1822 from the Mongolian Police Station. The pedestrian, named Liu Jinshan, 46 years old, from Hebei, was said to have been injured when people gathered to set off large firecrackers near the Hanqiao Bridge on Xinmin Road during the Lantern Festival. For some reason, the release was not done properly, causing the injury. Dr. Lu Binyuan, the doctor on duty at the hospital, found that the leg was blown through, a hole in the right lower leg, and bleeding profusely. He immediately bandaged the wound, but the injury was very serious, and there was a risk of fire poisoning. It was also learned that the police station had detained the person responsible for the accident and was investigating the matter.</p>

His injuries were quite serious. The hospital is currently investigating the Westerner who committed the assault and bringing him to justice.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Your newspaper published a case on February 6 concerning the dispute between the deceased Kuai Shintai's widowed mother, acting as legal representative, and his family. This is inconsistent with the facts. This Western woman is Scottish, her maiden name is Third. In 1920, she came to China with Kuai Xiuxian. The following year, she was involved in a divorce lawsuit with Kuai Xiuxian. In 1922, the divorce was finalized. In May of the following year, Kuai Xiuxian died of illness. This Western woman then remarried a Shanghai Municipal Council patrolman named Tranbergh. Although Tranbergh retired and returned to his country in 1936, the Western woman did not go with him. However, nominally, she is Mrs. Tranbergh and has no relationship with the Kuai family. Our entire Kuai family cannot recognize her as Kuai Shintai's widow. This is a correction. The entire Kuai family of Hefei.</p>
<p>To the Editor, Your newspaper published on the 15th of this month the case of Zhang Shoupeng from Yan City seeking redress for his daughter Xinbin, who died more than a year ago. After reading it, I find it strange. Xinbin died at 1:30 p.m. on February 19 of this year. She was not beaten before her death, nor did Chen Xiaozhi and others come to her rescue. During the examination, there was no confusion. It is clear that your newspaper's investigation was inaccurate. Therefore, I am writing to request that your newspaper make a correction immediately to reflect the facts and to respect the truth. This is for the public good. Respectfully, Zang Daqian, 1371 Guangfu Road, Shanghai, February 15.</p>
<h3>Research on Changing the Appearance of Huaicun and the Appearance of the Wilderness</h3>
<p>— Niu Yongjian</p>
<p>Lecture at the Yutang People's Education Center</p>
<p>If we want to create a natural park in the whole area, the key is to improve the appearance of the villages and the wilderness, because the villages and wilderness are the largest part of the area, and the best natural scenery is exclusive to the villages and wilderness. The villages and wilderness are vast and clean, easy to tidy up, and not as dirty as the cities, which are not easy to start. Now, I will briefly offer my research opinions as follows:</p>
<p>If we take a trip to the concessions, we will see that their cities and villages are magnificent and beautiful in their management. Only this appearance is enough to make people admire. From admiration, people can't help but admire them. This has a great impact on foreign affairs. However, if we travel to various countries in the world, we will see that this kind of beautiful phenomenon is almost the same. That is, the newly built Japan in Asia and the colonies of various countries are almost the same. Moreover, compared with the concessions in Shanghai, they should be even better. Looking back at the villages and cities we have arrived at, they are all humble, dirty, and inferior. In contrast, we almost doubt that our people are not as good as the foreigners in terms of race. The brains of those with simple minds even wish to serve foreigners, or wish to be subordinate to foreign countries, or even create strange theories, thinking that to improve China, we must welcome foreigners to enter China, and only then can it be done in a hundred years. This is the argument that we often heard in the early days of the revolution, and we can know that the beauty of the appearance is of great significance in the competition of human beings. However, if we analyze the advantages of various places in the world, they are nothing more than convenience, accuracy, solidity, greatness, neatness, cleanliness, hygiene, and aesthetics. If we analyze the above advantages, greatness and solidity are based on financial resources; accuracy and convenience are based on learning. It is difficult to achieve them in one step, but in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places today, many of our Chinese people have been able to reach them. As for neatness, cleanliness, hygiene, and aesthetics, they are not entirely based on financial resources, nor do they require profound learning. They can be achieved only with the aspirations in our minds and the diligence in our bodies.</p>
<p>We should find other methods to gradually achieve the financial resources and learning that we cannot achieve in a short period. As long as we find the way and do some hard work, it is not impossible in a few years or decades. As for the things in our minds and bodies, such as neatness, cleanliness, hygiene, and aesthetics, we can start immediately and improve them in a short period, so that the current local scenery can show a beautiful degree, which is not difficult.</p>
<p>This improvement of the appearance of the place is called city appearance in the city and rural appearance in the countryside. The accumulation of city appearance and rural appearance in the whole country is the national appearance. The quality of the national appearance is related to the honor and disgrace of the country. The good ones make people respect them, and the bad ones invite humiliation, and even the disaster of oppression and extinction. It is really no small matter. According to the theory of the Yangxin School in the world, an Englishman first created the plan of a garden city 20 or 30 years ago. This is to improve the city with the improvement of the rural appearance. Because the city is densely populated, the economy is oppressed, and the hygiene and life are not good enough, which leads to various bad habits. Whether rich or poor, they feel uncomfortable. Therefore, the rich and powerful in the city first moved to the countryside to avoid it. Those below the middle class and the poor, of course, do not have this opportunity. Therefore, sociologists advocated the theory of garden cities, seeking the fundamental transformation of the city, that is, to spread the benefits of the countryside to the city. This theory was advocated by England and first tried by two rich and ambitious people. In a few years, various countries followed suit, and now it has spread all over the world. All newly built cities are dominated by this theory, and there is no one who seeks the development of the city in the city. For example, the central area of Shanghai is now moved to Yinxiang Township. However, this is only for the city, and not for the largest number of villages in the whole country, which is not a fundamental way to create a park in the whole area.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are those who go against it, that is, the theory of urbanization of the countryside. This theory occurred before the above theory, that is, in the middle of the 19th century, after the great development of science in the city, and it was especially prevalent in 1878. The various facilities in the countryside are certainly very good. The shortcoming is to move the urban construction that is not suitable for the countryside to the countryside, such as factories, dance halls, racetracks, night gardens, etc. This is not what the countryside needs. However, the countryside is used as a sacrifice for the city. The facilities that the countryside should have are forgotten, such as health agencies, guidance agencies, agricultural production and cooperation agencies, rural organizations, rural entertainment, etc. Everything is ignored, so the more developed the city, the more declining the countryside. The general social unrest is due to this, so it is not adopted by scholars and politicians.</p>
<p>The necessary facilities in the countryside, in terms of materials and guidance, can be summarized as one is for livelihood, one is for hygiene, and one is for utilization. The entertainment facilities should also have the meaning of the above three items. Among the above items, many are the same as the city, and there are also those that the countryside should have but the city does not need to have, and there are also those that the city should have but the countryside does not need to have.</p>
<p>Today's topic is not about facilities, so we will not discuss the facility issue for the time being. Today, there are easy-to-do projects in the countryside that are also related to livelihood, hygiene, utilization, and entertainment, that is, the so-called rural appearance in the previous article.</p>
<p>The countryside is rich in beautiful natural scenery such as mountains, forests, bamboo, grass, and farmland. If the city can have one of them, it is already a scenic spot. In the countryside, this kind of scenery is everywhere, and the air is fresh and the sunshine is sufficient. Farming, animal husbandry, fishing, and hunting, climbing mountains and facing water, and riding boats are all natural fun. As for strolling in the spring suburbs, the flowers are pleasant, the summer resorts, the water and wood are bright, the autumn water and red leaves are gorgeous, and the winter plains are covered with mold. Even if you have a glimpse, you can be healthy. The Sunday rest tour is physical education. If we use the advantages of the rivers, lakes, and seas, and the wonders of the Five Mountains and the Great Wall in this newly emerging country, and imitate the arrangement and organization of Switzerland and Japan, then the beauty will be overwhelming. Other places, such as the vast Central Plains in the north, the thousands of mountains and ridges in the four borders, the evergreen land in Fujian and Guangdong, and the snowy days in Manchuria and Mongolia, are all unparalleled in the world, surpassing the world, and are not comparable to the countries in Europe and America. Even near this big city of Shanghai, using the natural beauty and mild climate to make the local natural objects and man-made objects in each district and each township well-organized, and become a natural good scenery, then the celebrities at home and abroad and the people of the city will flock to it, thinking that it is a paradise. This is equivalent to preparing a temporary villa for the 3 million people in the special city, and it is a place for them to enjoy without spending money, labor, or spiritual energy. If you think about it, if we can achieve this, what will the local scenery be like at that time! What will the interest of the masses be like! It is definitely not comparable to the dry and scattered today. If we make various rules to limit unreasonable disturbances and increase higher-level entertainment, then we will be able to sit back and enjoy the benefits that neither the mainland nor the city can get. This is what we should be aware of.</p>
<p>Rural appearance is a general term for the beauty of the countryside. If we analyze it, it can be divided into two categories: village appearance and wilderness appearance. The village is the village where people live, and the wilderness is the field where people do not live. The two must be tidied up appropriately to show beauty.</p>
<p>Based on today's economic situation, we don't want to talk too much about equipment and construction. We only want to start with what is easy and easy to do, that is, we should start with cleanliness, neatness, hygiene, and beauty. However, we should gradually improve and seek convenience, accuracy, solidity, and great poetic advantages based on the development of the economy and the improvement of interest, so as to give full play to the inherent characteristics of the countryside and complete its rural appearance.</p>
<p>As for cleanliness, neatness, beauty, and hygiene, we should also proceed gradually, distinguishing between urgency and priority. First, let's talk about the appearance of the village. The improvement of the appearance of the village is more urgent than the appearance of the wilderness, because the appearance of the wilderness has natural scenery. Even if it is not artificially added, it will not be unsightly. Even if there are unsightly places, it will not make people disgusted. Only the residence is not tidied up, and the sweat and dirt are chaotic, which is the most proof of the decline of our culture and the inferiority of the race. This is what we should strive for. Moreover, the beauty of the tour must be based on the residence as a base, such as tea houses, taverns, restaurants, milk halls, ballrooms, exercise fields, reading rooms, music pavilions, photo galleries, local product display centers, and other scenic spots, historical sites, resting places, and stopping points are all near the residence, so if the appearance of the village is not tidied up first, the tourists will have no place to stay. Even if there is a natural good scenery, it will not attract tourists. On the other hand, if everyone pays attention to the appearance of the village, the villages in the fields have natural scenery around them, which is the easiest to create a good place. Therefore, the wild scenery attracts the tourists with the beauty of the villages, which is equivalent to the villages borrowing the beauty of the wild scenery to enjoy the fisherman's profits. This is what we should be aware of. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Women's Special Edition</p>
<h3>How to Cope with the Environment</h3>
<p>— Lin Yun</p>
<p>In a capitalist society, women's status, although higher than in previous eras, still faces realities. Without abandoning reality or speaking abstractly, women's current circumstances, especially in Chinese society where feudal vestiges haven't been entirely eradicated, show they endure external pressures due to their objective status. Furthermore, the value assigned to them in the eyes of the opposite sex remains below par. The origins of this phenomenon, of course, lie in the expansion of the capitalist social system and the lingering influence of feudalism. However, adopting an objective standpoint, we must also scrutinize the women's own ranks.</p>
<p>Certainly, the assault of adverse external forces hinders women's prospects. But fundamentally, it's crucial for women to focus on cultivating the strength to combat, resist, and even eradicate these negative forces. This is a matter deserving even greater attention.</p>
<p>Society is essentially a highly complex box, surrounded by various kinds of adverse latent forces. Standing within this box, how should we navigate this complex environment? How should we address this adverse environment to prevent women's status from being oppressed by it?</p>
<p>Therefore, understanding how to cope with the environment should be a matter of personal importance to women, especially in these extraordinary times.</p>
<p>The minimum requirements for coping with the environment should include the following: (1) Cultivate a calm mind. (2) Engage more in group activities. (3) Always be mindful of real life. (4) Make your life serious. (5) Increase the strength of women's organizations. (6) Foster a spirit of mutual assistance.</p>
<p>If you can train your mind to be calm, it means you won't face difficulties in responding to situations. Furthermore, under calm observation, we can understand the occurrence and future of things. Being able to clearly understand the beginning and end of a matter naturally prevents us from being struck or controlled by it. Engaging more in group life allows us to better understand the power and spirit of the masses. From the power and spirit of the masses, we can see the loveliness of humanity. At the same time, we can discover the barriers between people and, by extension, the barriers within society, because society is simply an expansion of the group. Having become accustomed to group life, facing society won't be so frightening. Being mindful of real life ensures that our thoughts and actions don't exceed reality, creating illusory dreams, nor do they fall behind the times due to a lack of progress. Making one's life serious allows us to cultivate a meticulous spirit towards even the smallest matters. From a serious life, we can generate a forward-moving power. As for increasing the strength of women's organizations, it is akin to increasing personal strength, because groups and individuals are always inseparable. Cultivating a spirit of mutual assistance actively eliminates women's bad habit of not being accustomed to important matters – matters of the masses. Because humanity needs mutual assistance to generate considerable strength, especially women, who should pay particular attention to this point in the face of real-world circumstances.</p>
<p>Being able to cope with the environment then enables us to create our careers within it. Therefore, women on the front lines of progress should all pay attention to how to cope with their environment.</p>
<h3>### Our Nation's Women Should Diligently Engage in Home-Based Side Occupations</h3>
<p>— Yasheng</p>
<p>Unemployment is virtually immeasurable among the Chinese people. If we were to conduct a household-by-household survey, we would find that in nearly every family, only a small number of people have proper jobs. Many families, with all their members, rely on others for survival. Therefore, poverty seems to be a widespread phenomenon among our nation's people.</p>
<p>However, generally speaking, unemployed men, unless their reputation is severely tarnished, can easily find work as long as they are willing to work hard and don't make excessive demands on status or position. As for women, it's not so easy. Moreover, women who are married are further burdened by their children, making it even harder for them to pursue a career outside the home. This is a very serious issue for both the women themselves and their family's finances. If most women could engage in suitable vocational activities, it would not only greatly help the family economy but also naturally and invisibly elevate the status of women.</p>
<p>However, since job opportunities in society are already difficult to come by, and women cannot abandon their responsibilities at home, women don't necessarily have to force their way into the workforce. Engaging in home-based side occupations is also a legitimate way for women to engage in vocational activity. Furthermore, engaging in home-based side occupations allows women to handle household chores while avoiding many unnecessary restrictions. When things get busy, the whole family can pitch in and help, making it free and enjoyable, isn't that much more interesting than engaging in other kinds of occupations?</p>
<p>Now, I will classify and describe the home-based side occupations that are easier to engage in. If readers are interested in this, then based on your interests and environmental needs, quickly start working hard!</p>
<p>1. Concerning Sewing and Embroidery - such as tailoring and embroidery.</p>
<p>2. Concerning Knitting - such as knitting clothes, shoes, socks, and various other items.</p>
<p>3. Concerning Gardening - various planting of vegetables, fruits, and flowers.</p>
<p>4. Concerning Handicrafts - such as manufacturing cosmetics and various utensils.</p>
<p>5. Concerning Animal Husbandry - such as raising silkworms, chickens, and bees.</p>
<p>6. Concerning Other Aspects - such as operating various part-time affairs for others.</p>
<h3>### Home Gardening After the Start of Spring</h3>
<p>— Cao Yixuan</p>
<p>Now that the season of the Start of Spring has passed, it is the time to prepare for home gardening throughout the year. As plants have gone through a season of deep sleep, work in the garden is gradually becoming busy. The main tasks starting in February are managing and protecting autumn-sown annuals and bulbs, separating perennial annuals, organizing flower beds, tidying lawns, and pruning roses and grafting. Flower beds, seedbeds, and frost-proof straw should be carefully tidied, properly weeded, fertilized, and watered to ensure healthy seedling development. In the open spaces of the garden, deep tillage should be carried out thoroughly, the soil should be disinfected first, and then compost, wood ash, superphosphate, lime, rice bran, bean cake, bone meal, etc., should be mixed appropriately and ploughed into the soil (not roughly, to avoid freezing and weathering). Remove debris and inferior seeds from the seeds collected last autumn, select them carefully, establish a cultivation plan, and make a cultivation schedule table, noting the types, quantities, locations, availability of seedlings, and required soil and fertilizers to be planted this year. Repair any incomplete tools quickly. If there are perennial annuals, divide them in the middle of this month and plant them in flower pots or flower beds. Other flowers and trees can also be gradually transplanted and rotated, such as planting shrubs such as boxwood, potted pine, potted cedar, daphne, azaleas, etc. in the flower beds. Transplant from the end of February. Retain one-third of last year's rose branches, and the rest must be pruned away. Pruning of deciduous flowering plants, grafting, cutting, grafting, etc., also start from the end of February. Lawns are usually mowed two or three times a year, and should be mowed once more in February, or fertilized and loosened soil should be added to the grass six or seven minutes. Then, by the turn of spring and summer, it will be dense and lush. Because the roots of the lawn grass are very shallow, if two or three years pass, their roots will all be along the ground surface between one and two inches, with no room for development. At the same time, because weeds spread, the turf will naturally disappear. However, weeding requires patience, and it should be divided and mowed in the first ten days of this month. If it reaches the last ten days of this month, it will bloom and bear fruit, making it even more difficult to tidy. Greenhouse, in the greenhouse cultivation of flowers and trees, must adjust the temperature, generally the cold room, the night is forty degrees, the daytime is seventy degrees, and should pay attention to the opening and closing of windows, heating irrigation, fertilization, etc. Because insulation in this month is the most painstaking. Sowing, such as bulbous begonias, gloxinia, achimenes, etc., are sown in the last ten days, such as stocks, lobelia, aster, menasia and other one- or two-year-old annuals, are sown in flat flower pots. Cutting, carnation, colilus, geranium, Mexican begonia and other roses, can be grafted from the first ten days of February. Generally speaking, the axillary buds or lateral buds after flowering, as well as the overgrown useless branches of roses, etc., are the best season for wood cutting in February. As for protection and management, special attention should be paid. On sunny mornings, cold winds and severe frost should remove the covered straw matting and expose it to the sun. If the upper layer of straw matting is wet from frost and dew, dry it in the sun on the same day, and cover it with straw matting again after 3 pm to prepare for the cold at night. On windy days, prevent dryness, and after rain and snow, prevent freezing. When the flowers are about to bloom, irrigate them with more water, and when the flowers are in full bloom, prohibit watering. Seed collection, such as Cineraria, Cylamur, Drimrose, etc., prepared for seed collection, must be moved into a medium-temperature greenhouse and stop watering. At 10:00 a.m. every day, use the artificial pollination method, that is, use a brush to dip the male flower to the female flower to promote early fruit setting. After the fruit is completely set, move it to a low-temperature greenhouse until the seeds are fully ripe and harvested.</p>
<h3>Applying Rouge and Powder Conceals Innocence</h3>
<h3>### Simple Method of Making Pickles</h3>
<p>— Zhang Wang Jinghua</p>
<p>Sichuan pickles are the most famous. When making them in Sichuan, there are special pickle jars. However, based on my experience, these jars are not necessary, especially for families who often travel.</p>
<p>Speaking of its preparation method, it is also very convenient. In winter, yellow cabbage (also known as Jiaodong cabbage) is fat and tender. Cut it into small pieces (not too small, about half an inch square). First, boil water with salt, put it in a bowl (or a clean wine jar is fine). After it cools down completely, put in the cut yellow cabbage and whole chilies, and add some spices, such as fennel and peppercorns, as well as some yellow wine. Cover the mouth of the jar, as long as dust does not enter, even if it is ventilated, it does not matter. After six or seven days, it can be used as a side dish. When needed, take out the chopsticks in the salt water and cover it again. This is a very tasty pickle. When the first batch of vegetables is finished, add yellow cabbage again, and use it in rotation. The salt water can be used three or four times, which is very economical.</p>
<p>I make pickles every winter to give to relatives and friends, and everyone praises them. In fact, the preparation method is very simple. Those who ask may wish to prepare them according to the method, and it will definitely have a special flavor.</p>

In addition, there were dozens of scrolls of famous Wu people's hand-painted historical sites in Wuzhong, and hundreds of letters from famous Wu people, all of which were extremely exquisite. The revolutionary historical materials included Taiping Heavenly Kingdom field vouchers and commercial vouchers, Mr. Zhu Liangren's banner for recruiting national souls on Lion Mountain, the handgun of the martyr Shi Cheng Ran, Mr. Zhang Taiyan's revolutionary Yan costume for promoting revolution in Tokyo, and the portraits of revolutionary martyrs, etc., which were awe-inspiring. The Pan family's literature was allocated a special room, with hundreds of pieces on display, full of beautiful things. In addition to the exhibition halls, there was also a Mei Lu room, displaying many fine varieties of potted plums, such as Yudie Jiangying, Green Calyx Rouge, Red Iron Bone, Red Vermilion, etc., which were published by Mr. Zhou Shoujuan of Ziluolan House, which were antique and elegant. In addition to the literary fun of the exhibition, watching the national flower is a very good idea. The number of visitors to the conference has reached more than 5,000 in the past few days. There are Boy Scouts to maintain order and firefighters to be responsible for fire prevention. The measures are well-prepared. It is said that people from the capital have made reservations to come together, and the closing date has been extended to March 1. The Suzhou Library has such a great event, and it is impossible not to admire the courage of the gentlemen of the library.</p>
<h3>### Fifth Letter</h3>
<p>Ms. B:</p>
<p>Your letter stated that your relative purchased a piece of land in Huangshan and plans to build a villa; but, besides the land occupied by the house, the part prepared for building a garden has three shortcomings that your relative is quite dissatisfied with. Namely, it's not square, not flat, and not spacious. So your relative entrusted you to discuss with me, is there any way to remedy this?</p>
<p>Ms.! Please relay this to your relative! What your relative sees as three major shortcomings, from our garden-making perspective, are not only not shortcomings but also have advantages. So, although your relative is very frustrated now, thinking that he has bought a useless piece of land, you can tell him: I am even planning to congratulate him.</p>
<p>First, according to the map, that piece of land is polygonal. After removing the house, the shape is naturally even more irregular; but you must know that making a garden is not like making four-happiness meatballs, why does it have to be a large square? To put it extremely: "Garden-making" really avoids squares. If you are making an American-style patterned garden, then square land may be acceptable; however, it always feels too rigid. As for not being that kind of shaped garden, square or rectangular lands are not suitable for garden-making. The biggest reason is that it lacks change and twists and turns. The structure of the garden should first make visitors enter it, and not be able to see how big the garden is. If you can see everything at a glance when you open the door, it's not interesting. The ground not being square is a natural change, a natural twist and turn, nothing could be better. So, if we happen to buy square land, in order for the garden to have changes and twists and turns, we have to build the house in such a way that the remaining space becomes non-square.</p>
<p>Second, not being flat is very economical. The layout of the garden can be roughly divided into two types: one is flat, the engineering is simple, and the cost is very low. The other is uneven, high ones are built-up mountains (i.e., mounds decorated with stones), and low ones are pools. This has changes in appearance; however, the project is not small, on one side you have to pile up mountains, and on the other side you have to dig pools, which costs money and time. If this empty space for garden-making is originally uneven, then it can be used greatly. When designing, you should first look at the height of the terrain and use it to embellish. High places can be used to build mountains, and low places can be used to dig pools. Doing it this way costs little and saves time. This can really save your relative a lot of money. But if you draw up another pattern and must use it on this ground, and don't use its unevenness, then not only will you not get cheap, but you will also suffer a big loss, and you may end up digging a pool in a high place and building a mountain in a low place, turning into a double project.</p>
<p>Third, the garden is too small, of course, it is a disadvantage; but in your relative's current situation, it doesn't matter, and it can also save money. Your relative's land is on a hillside. Not to mention that the ground is too small, even if there is no more than one foot of land, you can still get an excellent garden. Because looking out from the room, you can see the distant scenery. This place, which looks like a natural park outside the garden, although not owned by your relative, your relative has the right to enjoy it. In our garden-making, this is called borrowing scenery. Wherever there is good scenery next to mountains and lakes, you can find ways to borrow light. At this time, even if your own garden is a little smaller, it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>So, quickly give a good news to your relative, tell him not to be disappointed, and start construction immediately. (Zhuo Dai)</p>

<h3>### Busy for Money</h3>
<p>— Qin Jia</p>
<p>Twenty days ago, Qiusheng was really so anxious that he couldn't even breathe. Although it was said that last year was a good year, it wasn't good for him. Wheat prices rose, but Qiusheng never planted wheat; as for rice, the market price seemed to have never fallen, but the bosses of those rice shops in the countryside were too shrewd. They said in unison that it was a good year and that sales were sluggish, and they would pay at most four or five yuan per load, and if they were not happy, they would not want three yuan. Therefore, Qiusheng at the end of the year, as every year, had to suffer from "New Year's illness" once. He knew that the bill from the sundries shop could not be avoided, and the bill from the sauce garden had to be paid; and there was a loan with an interest of three cents, and at least the interest of twenty-seven yuan had to be sent on New Year's Eve, otherwise Master Jia San would not forgive him.</p>
<p>Qiusheng had a cousin named Xuelan, who was married in Shanghai. Every year at the end of the year, she would still subsidize him with twenty or thirty yuan, generally around twenty-five or six yuan. Unexpectedly, there was a sudden change last year. He waited until the twenty-eighth day of the year and there was no news. Qiusheng was very anxious, and after discussing with his wife, he had to bite the bullet and find his way to Shanghai himself.</p>
<p>Xuelan's husband is a great lawyer, and he is very busy with social events. When Qiusheng walked into his house, he and his wife had just returned from outside. Xuelan greeted her brother while taking off the furry, shiny leather coat on her body and putting it on the clothes rack. This leather coat was really too good. Qiusheng, who had never seen the world, couldn't help but stare at it with his two crow eyes. Xuelan looked at him and found it funny, so she asked him: "Do you understand if these gray backs are good or not?" Qiusheng hurriedly nodded, but in fact he didn't understand what gray backs were at all.</p>
<p>"Second sister? How much does this coat cost to buy?" Qiusheng asked.</p>
<p>"This one is not the best either. I bought it for three hundred and eighty yuan." Xuelan said very casually.</p>
<p>Three hundred and eighty yuan! This was really something Qiusheng had never dreamed of. He thought that when Master San married his daughter half a year ago, two boxes of leather clothes were bought for three hundred yuan, and everyone was so envious when they heard it. Now his cousin's coat alone cost three hundred and eighty yuan, what was going on.</p>
<p>"This was just bought a few days ago because it's going to be the New Year." Xuelan said again.</p>
<p>This made Qiusheng feel even more surprised. Everyone has to celebrate the New Year, and it is not easy for poor people to find three yuan when the New Year comes, but rich people are only afraid that they have money but nowhere to spend it when the New Year comes! Qiusheng thought that poor people were really too basic!</p>
<p>When eating, Qiusheng opened his mouth shamelessly. Xuelan did not refuse and agreed to lend him thirty yuan. In the afternoon, she also took him out to the main road to buy some New Year goods. When Qiusheng glanced at those shops, he was almost scared to death. He only saw that every place was crowded with people, desperately earning a lot of money, competing to buy all kinds of high-priced things. This situation was really like a robbery.</p>
<p>Qiusheng couldn't help but sigh secretly:</p>
<p>"Poor people are only afraid of not having money to spend when the New Year comes, but rich people are only afraid of having money but nowhere to spend it when the New Year comes! What is the difference between poor people and officials!"</p>
<h3>Feelings on "The Way of Husband and Wife"</h3>
<p>— Cai Mohuai Zhu</p>
<p>Recently, I visited Madam Cai Sheng Bai, Mo Huai Zhu, at her residence and requested her views on the ideal wife and mother, and on family matters. Madam Mo greatly advocated the principles of the ideal wife and mother. Due to her recent recovery from illness, she was unable to elaborate extensively. Instead, she presented an essay she had written during her illness, entitled "Feelings on Reading 'The Way of Husband and Wife.'" The piece is sincere and heartfelt, emanating entirely from her natural disposition. Furthermore, the spirit of kindness, filial piety, and brotherly love permeates every word. We are publishing it as follows: (Reporter's Note)</p>
<p>During my leisure, I perused novels and magazines and came across "The Way of Husband and Wife," published by the Ji Lian Association. Upon reading it, I was deeply moved. The writing is vivid, and the narration is clear, serving as a compass for young couples and enhancing the affection of mature couples. It blends seriousness and humor, comparable to Huang Jun Jiping's "Modern Couples." The women described in the book are mostly exemplary wives and mothers, worthy of emulation. In recent times, modern women often criticize the ideal of the virtuous wife and mother as a parasitic existence for men. However, they fail to recognize that national order stems from household order, a principle evident since ancient times. Furthermore, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's New Life Movement emphasizes propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. Therefore, I believe that women today should strive to be virtuous wives and mothers. Alas, I am of mediocre virtue and shallow learning, and I can only deeply encourage myself to practice these virtues. During my illness, I revisited my diary of the past twenty years, acutely aware of the fleeting nature of time and the proper path forward. Therefore, I have extracted a few memorable entries from my diary, intending them as self-admonishments and as conversational aids for my sisters and female relatives.</p>
<p>I am from Wuxing, Zhejiang, born in 1900 according to the Gregorian calendar. My father was in the silk business. Although not wealthy, we were comfortably well-off. My mother bore three daughters, including myself, and one son. As the eldest daughter, I was deeply loved by my parents. From infancy to adulthood, their affection was constant. However, I had little knowledge and enjoyed reading tragic novels. Affected by these stories, I shifted my temperament, believing that ancient writers became more skilled through hardship, and readers were more easily moved by sadness. The same held true for novels and plays. As my habits changed, I often fell into pessimism, yet I was unaware of the source of my sorrow. Perhaps, this is what is meant by groaning without ailment! My father believed that my weak constitution was due to neurasthenia and strongly advised against it. I gradually adopted a more optimistic outlook. In 1920, I married Mr. Cai from the same town. The Cai family was a respected clan in Wuxing, with a long history of officialdom, living a life of honest poverty. My father-in-law had passed away by the time of my marriage, but my kind mother-in-law was still alive. My husband had just returned from studying abroad. Our early married life was incredibly sweet. However, due to differences in local customs, we lived separately from my mother-in-law for two years after the marriage. My father strictly admonished me that I must pay my respects to her morning and evening to fulfill my duties as a wife. Consequently, we brought her back to live with us, and I was bathed in her loving kindness, creating a harmonious family. In 1927, my husband's aunt passed away. We observed mourning rituals to the best of our ability. Subsequently, my husband's career flourished, and our love for each other grew even stronger. We treated each other with respect, as if we were guests. For sixteen years of marriage, we never spoke harshly to each other, comparable to the "Modern Couples" described by Huang Jun. Although my parents-in-law have been deceased for many years, we have many children. Furthermore, both my parents are alive and healthy, and Heaven has bestowed great fortune upon me. However, my father is now in his sixties and enjoys a peaceful retirement. My brother, raised in comfort, is unfamiliar with hardship. Therefore, my father entrusted my husband to manage the family business. We share weal and woe, and my husband is like a son to my father. This is possible because of our kindness and sincerity. I understand that the reason my husband and I have been able to maintain our love for so long is our sincerity and respect. Initially, I gave birth to six daughters, and one son died young, leaving me feeling depressed. My husband often comforted me in many ways. Last year, I had another son, and we were happier than ever. However, this spring, I fell ill with typhoid fever and spent a month in bed before recovering. Suddenly, my nerves went haywire, and I became unconscious. From morning till night, unkempt and dirty, I was no longer myself. I was mute and dazed, sometimes crying for no reason, unable to control myself. My parents were worried, and my husband cared for me. Doctors were called, and medicine was taken. For half a year, relatives and friends paid close attention. Fortunately, after Christmas, I gradually recovered, and I am still recuperating. As I write this, it feels like a lifetime ago. The arrival of the illness seemed like demonic interference, and the recovery seemed like divine grace. Perhaps the spirits of my late parents-in-law were protecting their daughter-in-law! Since I consider myself reborn, I must strive for happiness from now on. Human life is but a hundred years; how much joy can there be? A person's birth is like stepping onto a stage. Once on stage, one must do their best to become a star performer, not merely a nameless extra who shirks responsibility. During my severe illness, there may have been gossip from the outside world, but my love for my husband only increased. This shows that sincerity can move even metal and stone. A Western saying goes: "Marriage is the tomb of love." I disagree. Nowadays, there is freedom of marriage, and couples tie the knot only when their love has reached a boiling point. They support each other through hardship and assist each other in illness, seeking to never be apart. If the Western saying were true, why bother with marriage? Furthermore, I believe that human life is but a hundred years, and the body cannot escape the grave, but love should remain in the heavens and the earth, enduring through the ages and never fading away. I feel peaceful after recovering from my illness, and I've lost restraint with my crazy words. May the enlightened ones not laugh at my incoherent ramblings.</p>

<h3>"Kowtowing"</h3>
<p>— Zinan</p>
<p>I just read in the newspaper about the "progressive bullring" in Mexico that was set on fire by an angry mob because they couldn't see a bull fight a lion. It's a similar story here in China, Nanjing to be exact.</p>
<p>According to a Nanjing dispatch on the 23rd of a certain newspaper, "The 'Forties Theater Troupe' performed 'Sai Jinhua' at the National Theater on the evening of the 22nd. When Sai kowtowed to Waldersee, the audience felt that it was too insulting to the Chinese nation and threw fruit peels, spittoons and teapots at the stage, causing great disorder. The theater troupe promised to revise the script and perform again."</p>
<p>Is "Sai Jinhua" "too insulting to the Chinese nation?" No one mentioned it when "Sai Jinhua" was published in "Literature;" no one mentioned it when it premiered in Shanghai; no one mentioned it in the days before its premiere in Nanjing. It can be seen that the claim of "insult" is not very reliable, or at least not every audience member thinks so. Moreover, if there really was a place where it "insulted the Chinese nation," the script review board would definitely not have passed it. Now, even the "kowtowing" part has not been deleted, so it can be seen that the government authorities do not think that the claim of "insult" is true either.</p>
<p>The play "Sai Jinhua" is a satirical drama with historical facts as its background, based on the Boxer Rebellion. The "kowtowing" written in the script (as far as I know, the one who kowtowed to Waldersee was a junior official in the Tianjin Foreign Affairs Bureau, not Sai Jinhua) was originally a satire on "kowtowing diplomacy." In "Sai Jinhua," the one who shouted "Slaves only know how to kowtow, kowtow to foreign masters" was a Qing official wearing court clothes and a hat. Logically speaking, if you don't have a special liking for the Qing Dynasty, or want to cover up the昏庸昏庸昏庸昏庸混淆 of the officials of the fallen Qing Dynasty, the occurrence of resentment should be very unlikely.</p>
<p>But now, "the audience felt that it was too insulting to the Chinese nation and threw fruit peels, spittoons and teapots at the stage," which cannot help but make people wonder! Moreover, the occurrence of this unfortunate event was not on the first day of "Sai Jinhua's" performance, but after it had been performed for several days, which makes people even more wonder.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the unfortunate event that caused such "great disorder" was due to the fact that the play was performed too carelessly and did not express the original meaning of the script enough, and the audience's appreciation level happened to be low on that day, so that in the heat of the moment, like "the woodcutter chopping Cao Cao," the original dissatisfaction with "kowtowing diplomacy" ended up being vented on the play. If this is the case, although regrettable, it can still be seen that some of the people's hearts have not died, and the national future is still very optimistic. What I'm afraid of is that "thinking that it's too insulting to the Chinese nation" is just a hat, and that it's being seen as too satirical, and being forced onto one's own head.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then I think I have nothing else to say besides weeping bitterly.</p>
<h3>On the Way</h3>
<p>— Huang Ye</p>
<p>——From Gui Sui to Wuchuan</p>
<p>At seven o'clock in the morning, the eastern sky was just beginning to turn white. I heard the driver calling at the door. Dai and I quickly got out of bed, put on our plain old sheepskin coats, tied our belts around our waists, and put on a Genghis Khan-style goatskin hat with a white cockscomb of fur on our heads, and a pair of white felt short-legged boots on our feet.</p>
<p>A carriage pulled by two horses was parked outside the door. The horses were so thin that their ribs were showing, and they were impatiently kicking their hooves. Their tired grass-filled bellies were heaving and panting non-stop. The driver held the reins of the shaft horse and helped us into the carriage. The two of us filled the carriage to the brim. I leaned diagonally against Dai and couldn't move. The driver cracked his whip over the horses' heads, and the two horses stretched their necks upwards at the same time, stepped out with their trembling legs, and began to clatter and bang on the deserted road in the silence.</p>
<p>The carriage turned out of Hecheng, first climbing up a dirt road. The intricate ruts were very solid from being frozen by the cement. They were very neat, and occasionally there were gaps where the horses had kicked them out, just like countless broken knives thrown on the ground. On the tightly wrinkled mud skin, many water patterns floated. Before we had gone ten miles, we saw the Martyrs' Park. The monument to the martyrs who died in the resistance against the enemy on the Great Wall stood tall and isolated. Behind the monument were dozens of newly transported coffins of fallen soldiers from the front line. Behind the yellow and white coffins were hundreds of newly built mounds of earth, neatly arranged like they were standing in their positions on the border when they were alive, staring at the enemy with their guns loaded. I silently felt a pang of sadness, thinking of their heroic sacrifice and the brothers in the water and snow who were preparing to continue bleeding. This ancient nation in crisis, only they are the true heroes who protect the people! With tears in my eyes, I turned my face away, and a few swaying treetops brushed past the carriage. The carriage followed a slightly sloping mountain road with many stones.</p>
<p>The Daqingshan Mountains stretched across the front. The mountains were not high, but they were very rugged. There were sand and stones everywhere, and the carriage swayed even more violently. Dai's and my heads often bumped together. We looked at each other and smiled helplessly. We endured the ride in the carriage for another twenty miles or so, and stopped for a snack at the mouth of Wugongba. The clock's hand was at half past twelve.</p>
<p>Getting out of the carriage, I sighed a long breath. Watching the driver finish feeding the crows, he walked into a small shop to eat. We followed him in, wanting to drink some water. As soon as the door curtain was lifted, a wave of oily smoke rushed into our nostrils, and we sneezed twice, and tears streamed down the corners of our eyes. What was revealed in front of us was a large pit that occupied half of the room, with two young men lying on top of it. In the middle of them was a burning oil lamp, next to it was a small bucket of black opium paste, each with a pipe in their mouth, squinting their eyes, and enjoying themselves? Seeing us come in, they raised the upper half of their bodies and nodded to us. Dai and I said "um" and asked for a pot of plain water, and quickly ran out.</p>
<p>Bored, we sat on a rock, watching a series of large carts and donkeys coming from the back of the mountain, piled with clothes, furniture, women and children. They were refugees fleeing from the Wuchuan area.</p>
<p>After the driver finished eating, he started on the road again. The two of us walked in front of the carriage, entering this famous Wugongba. The road was only a little over ten feet wide, winding diagonally down from some rugged hills covered with rocks, like an earthworm, and like a centipede. In the steepest places, the slope was thirty degrees, and we could only struggle up by bending over. At a high altitude of three or four thousand feet, the air pressure was reduced, and we began to gasp for breath. We opened our</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Open our mouths and hurried upwards silently.</p>
<p>After walking about four or five miles, the road turned west, becoming horizontal, and rushed towards a high peak. We were sweating on our heads and bodies, and our undershirts were sticking uncomfortably to our skin.</p>
<p>"Let's take a break!" I said, and sat down on a rock.</p>
<p>Dai also chose a place to sit down, and lifted the front of his coat to wipe the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>After smoking a cigarette, the carriage also arrived, and we stood up again and walked upwards. Although the mountain was still a bit steep, the road was already a little flatter. We walked through the ranks of donkeys and carts. When we were about to reach the top of the peak, the road turned left and reached the top of the dam. This was the highest peak of the entire mountain. The entire Daqingshan Mountains were under our feet. The small hills were like many graves, arranged in a chaotic mess. The distant peaks, illuminated by the setting sun in the west, turned pale purple.</p>
<p>The sharp wind on the back of the mountain was blowing, and the electric wires were squeaking.</p>
<p>A truck rushed up, dragging a gray smoke tail. When it was about to reach the top of the peak, it had to stop temporarily because a bullock cart was blocking the way. The car roared and fumed, the car weighing heavily on the 30 degree incline, causing it to crawl backward like a dung beetle. The people in the car quickly jumped to the ground, picked up a large stone to hold the rear wheels, then turned the corner and went to the front, and whipped the bullock's back hard. The man driving the bullock cart glared at the one wearing foreign clothes, and quickly pulled the car to the side of the road, letting the car zoom past.</p>
<p>The downhill road was much easier to walk. We jumped lightly, and stepped over a small aqueduct. A block of ice pond in front blocked the way. The ice was frozen very smoothly. Looking at it, it was still solid. We walked up sliding half way, and when we were about to reach the edge, we heard the sound of broken ice. Our bodies tilted forward, and our right leg was already soaked in ice water. We jumped back quickly, and shook our feet on the dry ground. Our shoes were all covered in ice mud.</p>
<p>The afterglow of the bright red setting sun shrouded the bald heads of the mountains. The carriage took us another twenty miles, and at seven o'clock, we arrived in Wuchuan.</p>
<h3>Stillness</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>In front of the window, a wisp of faint white smoke is always curling from the ancient bronze incense burner. The white smoke drifts out of the window, but a trace of lingering breath flies around the room. A gust of slightly cold wind breaks in from the open window, imprinting many patterns of banana leaves on the glass window.</p>
<p>Standing by the window, looking at the blue and tranquil sky, the courtyard outside the window is covered with a layer of silvery moonlight, and some treetops are swaying in the wind, like waves in the sea.</p>
<p>There is only a pale green color in the room, and the surroundings are even more silent, as if walking into an ancient temple in the deep mountains, and oneself seems to be having a bronze-colored dream in a corner of the ancient temple.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I hear someone calling out to sell night food in the alley, but that sound seems to carry a kind of desolate taste, and this taste penetrates straight into my heart, like a sharp arrow.</p>
<p>I don't want to hear that trembling sound, so I close the window and move the ancient bronze incense burner in, placing it on the table in front of the window, and re-inserting three incense sticks into the burner, letting the incense smoke fly around the room.</p>
<p>Going back inside, I add enough coal to the stove, and the fire is burning fiercely, like a snake's tongue sticking out from the mouth of the stove, licking the brown mouth of the stove. I casually drag the rattan chair to the side of the stove, and in that gentle air, I sit in front of the stove, staring at the blazing fire in a daze.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there is a burst of rapid footsteps in the long corridor outside the door, but as soon as these footsteps pass by my door, they immediately return to silence.</p>
<p>The moonlight outside the window quietly creeps in from the glass window, and the sound of evening prayers in the mountain front chapel is carried to my ears by the cold wind from afar, rippling with medieval fantasies and shattering the silent air. Suddenly, it stirred a little wave in my congealed heart.</p>
<p>There is only a pale blue color in the room, and the surroundings are still so silent, as if walking into an ancient temple in the deep mountains, and oneself seems to be having a bronze-colored dream in a corner of the ancient temple.</p>
<h3>Visitor</h3>
<p>— Yanting</p>
<p>There was a faint knocking sound. ... ... ...</p>
<p>"Come in," I shouted loudly, without looking up from the chair.</p>
<p>The door, which was not locked, moved a few times gently, and then opened with a bang.</p>
<p>"I was thinking, would I be bothering you if I came in?..." It was a regretful, sighing voice.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, come in!" I said, putting down the work in my hand. It was then that I began to pay attention to the night visitor who had revealed half of his body from the crack in the open door. He was a middle-aged man with a tall frame and a slightly hunched back, bald, with a full beard, wearing only a single robe. Because it was raining outside, most of his clothes were already soaked through.</p>
<p>He stepped into the door, put down the suitcase in his hand, and stood there silently, using his wet sleeves to wipe the raindrops from his forehead.</p>
<p>"It's been two years, I think you may have forgotten me..." He smiled unnaturally, revealing a mouthful of yellow teeth. "But I have not forgotten you, and I still remember your address very clearly..."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I haven't been taught your name, are you...?" I was a little confused, but I didn't show my surprise and annoyance. I've encountered too many similar things.</p>
<p>"Zhu," he introduced himself, "we met in the upstairs of the tobacco shop on ×× Road before. At that time, there were also Li and Lin..."</p>
<p>I thought silently, searching through all the faded memories. Although I couldn't determine whether I knew him, his face and hoarse voice seemed to have been seen somewhere. So, I nodded and acquiesced to his words.</p>
<p>"Sit down," I said, "I would have forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it?" After a pause. "How have you been lately?..."</p>
<p>He sat down, reached out to take the hot water that I poured for him, and held the glass tightly with his cold palms to warm it. After about half a minute, he drank several gulps like a hungry dog swallowing a bone, and then raised his head from the ground, blinking his round eyes and groaning in a hoarse voice:</p>
<p>"It's lucky that I haven't starved to death, how can I talk about good or bad!"</p>
<p>"So, you've had a very bad time in the past two or three years?" I asked with interest.</p>
<p>He didn't answer immediately, but nodded silently. After a while, he said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"It's a long story." A deep sigh. "In the past three years, almost half of my life has been spent in prison and wandering. Not long after we met, you left Shanghai and went to a village in Ningbo..."</p>
<p>Continued on page five</p>

<p>, where a primary school wanted me to teach. The first semester went very smoothly, but at the beginning of the second semester, due to a misunderstanding, I was accused of being a ×× member and was arrested and imprisoned for half a year. I was released because there was no evidence. But because of this, I lost my job, and I wandered around with an empty stomach and a worn-out body. I couldn't think of a way to get by for more than a year, and finally I ended up in Shanghai again. … … …"</p>
<p>"Have you been here long?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No! Just arrived." He continued sadly, saying: "I have nothing left except this broken box. I can't find a friend for the time being, and I don't have money to stay in a hotel, and it's raining like this: so I thought of you, and it just so happened that you haven't moved." Silence, and then he said in a low voice. "I want to stay at your place for one night, would you be willing? Just a quilt, and I can spread newspapers on the floor."</p>
<p>His sorrowful story deeply moved me.</p>
<p>Outside the house, the rain was still falling sadly, and the alley had become as silent as death. In such a situation, it was impossible to refuse the request of an unfortunate person, so I nodded affirmatively.</p>
<p>The next day, when I woke up, the rain had stopped, and snowflakes were flying.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt that the house suddenly became empty. The new leather robe on the clothes rack was gone, and there were traces of rummaging in the clothes box piled in the corner. I was startled and got out of bed. The night visitor and his broken suitcase were gone. I became as flustered as an ant on a hot pot, pacing back and forth in the house, finally I found such a note on the table:</p>
<p>"When you get up, you may be surprised that you have been stolen from, but can you blame me for that? I have been hungry for several days, and I still need to live on in the future. … … …"</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, I became quiet.</p>

<h3>"Vigorous Dragon and Lively Tiger" in Hengshan</h3>
<p>Filming a Great and Tense Scene of Military and Bandit Fierce Battle</p>
<p>Local Garrison Participates, Mobilizing Over a Thousand People</p>
<p>Mingxing's new film "Vigorous Dragon and Lively Tiger", is a further step forward for Xu Xinfu after "Emerald Horse" and "Diamond Drill", a detective work. It exposes how our northern country is being disturbed, looted, and ravaged by those crazy bandits. It depicts the heroic detectives and the bandits in a magnificent, bizarre, and awe-inspiring story, a film with contemporary significance.</p>
<p>The final scene of the great and tense military and bandit battle was filmed specifically in Hengshan, Suzhou, with the consent of Commander Wang of the 87th Division of the local garrison, who dispatched a large number of troops to participate. The work is currently underway, with Commander Liu Mantian of the 517th Regiment responsible for leading the troops. A total of over a thousand people from two battalions participated, with 120,000 rounds of rifle bullets and 60,000 rounds of machine gun bullets. When the military and bandit battle performance began, the sound of gunfire was dense like a string of pearls, and the shouts of killing shook the sky, heard far and wide. Local citizens flock to visit every day, creating a sensation in Suzhou and becoming a topic of conversation.</p>
<p>After the filming of this final military and bandit battle scene is completed, the entire film will be finished, and the time to meet the audience will not be far off.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Literary, Film, Drama, and Music Circles' Declaration Against the Italian Navy's Atrocities</h3>
<p>The film "Abyssinia" objectively records the brave and sacred national war of Abyssinia. Therefore, when it was released in Shanghai, it was obstructed by Italy.</p>
<p>In order to consider the friendly relations between China and Italy, our government specially withdrew this film, which had already been approved for public release, for re-examination. Many "provocative" scenes were deleted. However, on the first day of its continued public release at the Shanghai Grand Theater on February 20th, Italian naval personnel and expatriates used violence to interfere with our compatriots' appreciation of this film, beating our compatriots, resulting in dozens of injuries, and seizing this film, which is passionately loved by all oppressed nations, and burning it. The theater also suffered great losses.</p>
<p>This is a great insult to our country. In the minds of the Italian naval personnel, there is no sovereignty for China to supervise films, no Chinese legal rights, and no police power.</p>
<p>We are confident that the government will demand compensation for losses, punishment of the perpetrators, an apology, and a guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again from Italy. We hope that all film audiences and patriotic compatriots in Shanghai and the entire country will unite to support the government's strong negotiations!</p>
<p>Long Live the national war of Abyssinia!</p>
<p>Long Live the independence and liberation of the Chinese nation!</p>

<h3>Nanjing Showing "Revolutionary Couple"</h3>
<p>Mona Oberon, the tender and beautiful actress in "Shanghai Mood", her new film "Revolutionary Couple" will be shown at the Nanjing Grand Theater starting today. The film tells the story of the Irish people's revolution in 1921. Mona plays the daughter of a diplomatic official who meets a young leader of the revolutionary party under certain circumstances. Duty and ideology want to separate them, but the fiery flames of love want them to melt together, leading to various tragic changes and a sad ending. Mona is even more beautiful and moving in this film, and her performance in weighing love and duty is extremely profound. The film is said to be a masterpiece carefully crafted by the major producer MGM.</p>
<h3>Chaplin and Ge Furong</h3>
<p>When Chaplin's "Modern Times" was released, it caused a sensation throughout the film industry. It is expected that Tianyi's "Wealth and Glory" will also cause a sensation when it is released. Because in "Modern Times", Chaplin had a comical performance of eating with machines, while in "Wealth and Glory", Ge Furong's eating is even more gimmicky than using machines to transport food. As long as you say what you need, the food will fly into your mouth, whether it's fish, chicken, duck, or cigars... everything is possible. The gimmick is so outrageous that even live eels will fly into Fatty Ge's mouth, making him not know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>"Wealth and Glory" will be released soon, please pay attention to the release date and location.</p>
