<h3>試行强迫入學辦法</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>全國義教委員會日昨在教部舉行會議。對於推廣義教辦法。曾經分門別項。製定議案。如地方義教經費之籌劃。中央義教經費之撥付。如辦理義教人員之考成及獎懲。如充實各級義教委會之組織並確定其工作。無不酌量情形。縝密討論而試行强迫人學辦法一項。尤為諸案中之更易促人注意者。蓋民智啟塞。攸關邦本。發朦振聾。教育是尚。唯當專制思想高出一切之際。帝王萬代之業。利在孤行己意。乃不恤採取愚民政策。以錮蔽一時之耳目。並世開明國家。罔弗以策進教育為立國之前提。而我國數年來民間風氣轉變之速。尤不能不歸功於教育之推動。特是我國區域廣闊。環境複雜。鄉村都會。情勢懸殊。畸形發達。習為常事。普及之效自難遽收。故時至今日。而猶不能不適用强迫之手段。要亦事之深堪嘅嘆者歟。</p>
<p>教育當局對于普迪民智。年前即已有掃除全國文盲之六年計畫。今復有義教委會之强迫辦法督促進行其底厲從事之苦心。良足予舉國以共見。惟于施行之手續。人才之訓練。材料之配備。流弊之補救。似均有不能不加以切實之考慮者。蓋在鄉僻地方。民情隔閡。良莠不齊。悍儒兼有。若彼輩已有向學之心。而祇限于經濟。則義教之設。已足吸引。但施勸導。無待强迫。若竟然視無睹。不受招致。是知其本無向學之欲求。或基于農事佃作之忙碌。或另有不能離家之苦衷。則必須會同保甲調查情實。曉以功令。曲加解釋。就其利便。酌予變通。而在向其申說之際。務宜平心靜氣。委婉明暢。期合强迫之旨。而無操切之弊。否則小涉誤會。易肇衅端。一子失著。滿盤皆錯。强者𢯕臂而抗命。弱者望風而卻走。既乖體制。復傷感情。本圖銳進。反樹阻力。不幾等于南轅而北轍乎。至所施教材。尤應特為編製。因地制宜。投其需要。字句務求淺顯。意義更須明白。新穎思想。奧妙理論。悉就汰除。藉免隔閡。而在教導之人。並應充分體察對方之程度隨時改進自己之講材。若能順便灌輸衛生常識。示以必要標本。俾得取徵實騐。必易博致信仰。或就國家立場。略示得失途徑。亦未嘗無絲毫之補益。凡此皆極淺近不難安排。者負責當局必須妥為指。示期其厲。行更應嚴密考核。絕其弊端。務使帑不虛糜。人無遺憾。言非徒託。事有實效。掃除文盲之計畫。何難如期而完成。</p>
<p>最後尚有一節應予申說者。經費為一切事業推動之本源。而義教尤宜有確切指定之的欵。關於此點。當局討論周詳。誠可無庸鰓慮。猶望諸公本其職責之所在。盡其最大之努力。保持既定用途。絕對勿聽挪移。則推廣義教。自可免於中墜。隔昨本埠公共租界納稅外僑舉行年會時。納稅人鮑爾曾慷慨主張。工部局對於其他經費。儘可緊縮。惟教育經費。應力求其充裕旨哉斯言。我教育當局其念之。其諦念之。</p>

<h3>英國工黨彈劾政府溺職</h3>
<p>已由下議院否决　西門辯護妥協政策</p>
<p>［倫敦］首相包爾溫對於西班牙北部海濱比爾波港為國民軍封鎖事、曾向下院宣稱、政府巳警告英船勿駛入該港、反對派工黨領袖阿特里對之大不滿意、今日特在下院提出彈劾政府溺職不能保護英商船案、旋付表决、經三四五對一三○票否决、</p>
<p>本日阿氏發言、謂政府之行動、實對大背國際公法之暴行、予以默認、並出巴斯克共和政府主席來電、以證明政府之失當、電中謂巴斯克與叛軍皆未在比爾波港人口處埋置水雷、四月份上半月中、出入該港之船、共五十八艘、未有受擾者、比爾波之砲隊、曾使叛軍艦隊駛離海岸十五哩之遙云、內相西門爵士代政府作答、屢受憤懣之中阻、西門謂政府之政策、志在避免足以危害良好國際關係之一切糾紛、並力戒干涉西班牙之內務、西門發言時、工黨議員或發評論或作譏刺之呼聲、幾無間斷、西門繼言、據英艦白蘭溪號四月六日報告、比爾波港巳嚴密封鎖、如商船希圖駛入、勢將引起重大事端云、西門加以評語曰、當地英艦艦長較之巴斯克政府、當更可靠、此言復引起反對黨之怒斥聲、反對黨要求宣布商部所發警告英商船勿駛入比爾波港之原電時、塲中又起風潮、西門績謂、海軍固能用大批掃雷艦强入該港、但將因此放棄不干涉政策、西門答勞合喬治之問話、謂英商船如為國民軍之軍艦攻擊、則英海軍自將予以保護云、本日辯論中有一特點、為邱吉爾之演說、邱氏於贊助政府後、建議曰、英國如將該問題提交莫斯科、則蘇聯將言、今後最為需要者、西班牙政府不得為國社黨者、亦不得為法西斯黨者、於是希特勒或可允諾不堅主西班牙實行國社主義、而墨索里尼對於西班牙政府無所偏倚、亦必可滿意、於是英法兩國可申請從事一種純粹性的西班牙之解决、五國可向西班牙人民提出下列之解决辦法、其解决應在六年中分三個階段行之、㊀和平時期、以便得閒使激昂之熱烈漸趨冷靜、㊁和解時期、設一混合之政府、㊂恢復議會制度、如雙方拒絕此項建議、則戰爭將繼續進行、如一方拒絕而一方接受、則列强應贊助接受之一方、</p>
<p>外相艾登繼起發言、追述上年八月間西班牙政府宣布封鎖國民軍摩洛哥各港時、英國並未提出抗議後、謂吾入今不能以交戰團之權利、給予任何一方、英國如依前例、允予以交戰團之權利者、則雙方皆拘捕破壞封鎖之英船甚至在公海中亦能拘之矣、</p>
<p>自由黨領袖辛克萊初曾詢問、如英船漠視警告、而在駛抵三哩界限以前受攻擊的、則英海軍將否予以保護、外相答稱、自將予以保護、惟政府責當以比爾波海濱之危險警告各船、因有此種危險、故不能在比爾波領海內擔保各船之安全、</p>
<p>外相又引述比爾波英領事之來電、內稱上兩週中、每日輒有轟炸、損毀甚巨、又引述船主國會委員會來電、內稱彼等對於政府竭力保護航業、殊為滿意云外相接言、如有掃除西班牙領海外之水雷、以保護英國航業之必要、政府當然將加以考慮、惟此為至重大工作、若在西班牙領海內實行强迫舉動、則將等于干涉、外相末乃言及邱吉爾所提出之𥸤請、謂英國如能作一貢獻、終止戰禍、則必將熱切作此貢獻云、（中央社十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>德願與各國合作復興世界經濟</h3>
<p>沙赫特在比發表宣言　英不擬談判減低關稅</p>
<p>比京　德意志銀行總裁兼代理經濟部長沙赫特博士今日接見報界代表、某記者詢問曰、德政府是否擬繼績排拒蘇聯加入歐洲協約乎、博士答曰、不然、德國今與蘇聯有重要之貿易、余殊希望兩國間之貿易將更發達云、（中央社十五日路達電）</p>
<p>比京　德國經濟部長兼中央銀行總裁沙赫特博士、頃向各報發表談話稱、渠此來甚為滿意、又謂渠與齊蘭總理、並未正式進行談判、而僅就一般經濟局勢、加以檢討而已、竊以為國際經濟狀况、欲求進步、非先解决各種政治問題不為功、各國不分大小、均當成立一種諒解、余並深信歐洲任何國均不欲從事戰爭、而吾人此際覓獲解决方案、亦較前時更多希望、余茲誠意願望齊蘭總理所進行之任務、克底於成、但齊蘭總理所企圓之經濟改善、務當先之以一段時局之緩和、此層齊蘭總理不久當可了然也、又謂、德國準備與各國合作、共謀世界經濟之復興、此種合作、斷不能將任何國擯諸門外、現於德俄兩國貿易之活躍、可以見之、“此項經濟複興事業、倘有待於幣制改革、則德國亦準備改革本國幣制、此余所以維持馬克穩定狀况、以迄於今也、但吾人亦所需要者、則係訂立國際協定、而將各國貨幣比價、予以規定、庶幾各國現所進行之短期交易、得以改為長期交易焉”、沙赫特最後聲稱、减低黃金價值之議、為渠所反對、又謂、渠不擬前往倫敦、僅當於五月五日作巴黎之行、俾為巴黎國際博覽會德國陳列館、主持開幕典禮云、（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　德國經濟部長兼中央銀行總裁沙赫特博士昨與比國當局所進行之談話、可分為兩部份、一即商務問題、一即歐洲與世界各項問題、沙赫特博士以為、經濟復興必先緩和政治局勢、多數國家倘能發出和平宣言、則政治局勢始可緩和、而德國對於原料品重行分配與恢復舊日殖民地兩項問題、亦可提出要求、似此沙赫特博士曾就政治問題、認真加以討論、特此比國政界人士以為、原料品重行分配事宜、實際上殆無實現之可能、關於殖民地問題、則比國政府所處立場、亦與德國願望相左、均未必有所成就、至以比德兩國切身問題而論、則比國所希望者、乃改善雙方貿易關係、俾收支情形、與七國較為有利、德國則惟以賺入原料品出售精製品為事、不願談及此事云、（中央社十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　消息靈通人士宣稱、德國經濟部長沙赫特博士、昨在此間所進行之談話、重在探詢意見、其尤所注重者乃英法兩國政府委託比國國務總理齊蘭所進行之調查事宜、各項政治問題僅約略涉及之、至德國向比國購買原料品一事、因德國缺乏外幣之故、殆已遭遇困難、沙赫特博士此行結果、係屬枝節的、別無多大成績、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］財相張伯倫昨在下院中發表宣言、稱渠此不擬開始進行談判、以謀减低國際貿易各項障碍、此項宣言發表之後、金融界人土均謂、减低關稅壁壘之談判、業已展緩開始、且尚屬遙遙無期、蓋就此項談判、英國主張、可分為三項、㊀各國貨幣匯價、應較為穩定、㊁不列顚帝國會議、將於下月中舉行、現當等待會議結果而定之、㊂英國願先與美國訂立商務條約、綜上觀之、英法兩國委託比國齊蘭總理所進行之調查工作、純屬一種準備性質、且係理論的、而非實際的即世界糖業會議之成功、現亦僅係一種臆想而已、（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］經濟部長兼中央銀行總裁沙赫特博士、頃於本日晨間九時四十八分、乘坐飛機、自比國京城返歸此間、意大利銀行總裁亞索利尼、亦於本日晨間到達、即當與沙赫特會晤、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［羅馬］德國勞工陣綫領袖勞伯萊博士來此之後、頃於昨日午後晋謁首相墨索里尼、意國政府並贈以三等勳章、嗣又走訪工業聯合會與工業職工聯合會、意國實業界即當派遣代表、前往德國報聘、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奧總理演講基本政策</h3>
<p>二十二日訪意</p>
<p>［維也納］奧總理舒斯尼格日在伯琴關向政界講奧國政策之基本原則、外間以為奧國不與德國聯合、即應恢復皇室、此種見解完全錯誤、渠稱、奧國當局將取得更大之權力、對付急進份子、或建議於緊急時期、准許“祖國陣綫”採取獨立行動、渠堅持國體問題、應由發展過程加以决定、發展之過程中、不應干涉奧國之獨立云、（十五日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［維也納］頃悉國務總理舒斯尼格及外交部長史密特、將於本月二十二日赴意大利威尼斯、俾與意相墨索里尼進行談話、（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］奧國國務總理舒斯尼格、定于本月二十四日、前來威尼斯港、與首相墨索里尼相會晤、會晤地點所由不在羅馬者、乃因舒斯尼格不欲過于張揚所致、至意國方面、則寗願在羅馬會晤、按意國近方與小協商各國相接近、舒斯尼格此行目標顯在澄清意奧兩國關係、關于此層、意奧匈三國所成立之羅馬議定書、仍賡續有效、特以表面事實而論、意國對於德國在奧國伸張勢力之抵抗力、已漸見削弱、意德兩國若已商定活動範圍、即德國注重中歐洲與巴爾幹半島、意國則注重地中海、此在舒斯尼格總理、自欲一探究竟也、（中央社十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫與土耳其</h3>
<p>意見一致</p>

<p>［倫敦］下院今日開會、其議員詢問德國既不承認羅卡諾公約、比國又將脫離該約之義務、英國是否仍受該約拘束、外相艾登答稱、英政府仍受一九三六年三月十九日協定中第三章第一節之拘束、英政府於此節宣布其對法比兩國之義務、即凡在破壞羅卡諾公約前後發生之事務、概不能視為已使該約簽字國免除彼等之任何義務或担保（中央社十四日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］英法兩國政府前曾商定發表共同宣言、使比國解除羅卡諾公約所規定之保障國義務、暨一九三六年九日間英法比三國參謀部協定所規定之義務、並由比國政府提出答覆、聲明該國恢復行動自由、但仍當信守國聯會盟約所載義務云云、</p>
<p>一般人現以為英法兩國此項宣言書當於下星期中艾登赴比聘訪之前（本月二十五日公佈、目前外交界人士堅主比國務當提出答覆、俾復文得與英法兩國宣言同時發表、但比國政府或因所擬復文、曾提及比國就國聯會員國地位所負担之義務、果爾、則能日國聯會盟約第十六條所載制裁辦法、若付諸實施、則比國即應機械性的自動允許外國軍隊通過國境、以赦尚有所躊躇而不願立即提出答覆云、（中央社十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>所得稅徵收須知修正要點</h3>
<p>市商會秘書嚴諤聲談</p>
<p>上海市商會、自所得稅條例細則及征收須知頒布後、經首先勸導各業實施、一面並邀集各地商會本市公會代表、舉行研究會、又於研究會散後、特組專門委員會、詳細討論、逐項條陳意見、請求修改、現財部巳將第一二三三類征收須知草案、修正公布、、對於上海市商會請求各項、頗多採納、此事關係全國商業者甚大、茲據該會秘書嚴諤聲發表談話、聲述重要之點如下、</p>
<p>公積計算　原第一類征收須知草案第五項、限制公積金範圍、僅指依法令所規定之公積金而言、此項限制、商界請求修改最大、而修正之第一類征收須知第六項、則為“凡法定公積、任意公積、盈餘滾存等均屬之、”雖修正須知第十三項對法定公積金、仍限於資本總額二分之一、但任意公積、卽能視同法定公積、則第十三項之限制、亦無關係</p>
<p>收付制度　原第一類須知、第九十兩項、對收付制度、均採應收應付制、但商界為事實及習慣關係、往往有窒碍難行者、現經所得稅事務處、採納商會請求、在修正須知第十二項規定、亦得各依其營業之必要、或原有習慣、以實收及已付者為範圍、計算其純益、”於商界便利不少、</p>
<p>捐欵開支　原第一類須知第十二項第三欵規定、“自由之捐贈、”不能作開支、商界以年來如購機祝壽捐欵、賑災捐欵、援綏捐欵、關係國防要政、救荒義舉、似應作為開支、以宏公益、現所得稅事務處、已將該欵改為“自由之贈與、”則此後凡關係公益慈善或業務有關之捐欵、可以作為開支、</p>
<p>折舊計算　原須知對於資產估價折舊、均訂有固定年限辦法、施行時往往咸覺困難、故商會請求補訂伸縮條文、現修正資產估價方法第十欵第十五欵第十六欵第二十六欵及折舊率計算表第十欵、均已有補充規定、以適合實際、</p>
<p>膳宿開支　普通商店職員使用人、均供給膳宿、而此項膳宿費、卽由店開支、但照以前解釋、能享受此項待遇之職員、僅以月薪不滿三十元者為限、倘在三十元以上、卽須將擲得之數、加入薪給徵稅、事實上非常困難、故商會請求將雇主供給之膳宿、不計入薪給報酬、現修正之第二類須知第九項、已將一業務使用人之膳宿開支、作為從事各業者先行扣除之費用、以其餘額為所得、但膳宿費以在業務所住宿或供膳者為限、</p>
<p>計算標準　本市各大企業工廠、對於使用人之薪給報酬、往往有按日按時扣計者、倘均以月定額數為計算稅率標準、而以其所得實額、照稅率標準折求納稅實數、實非常麻煩、此次修正第二類須知第十三項、卽係新增加者、其條文、為“以日計者、以時計者、或以件計者、均以該月份所得之實額計算課稅、”此外修正之點甚多、現上海市商會正在趕印全文、將以前發行之所得稅淺釋、逐項修正、以便商界作為根據云、</p>

<p>起訴意旨</p>
<p>後、問自訴人楊慶昌、是你丈夫、以前你到捕房告訴過你丈夫與唐湘英通奸、經本院判决確定、何以現在又要控告答因丈夫被唐湘英勒住、不放回家、有人見過慶昌仍與唐湘英同坐汽車出入、由我家當差李阿毛看見、慶昌於今年一月四日出外、至今未歸、并聞慶昌與唐另租</p>
<p>秘密房子</p>
<p>唐故意誘我丈夫脫離家庭、故再要控告她云云、被告辯護律師起稱、楊慶昌不在唐湘英處、昨日自訴人與楊慶昌、為支票涉訟於第一特區法院、開庭時、楊慶昌到案、退庭後、自訴人要楊慶昌回家、慶昌不肯回去、幾至爭執、由法警勸開送去、訊之自訴人稱、楊慶昌昨日到第一特區法院、退庭後、被唐湘英之父拉去、說要慶昌給與</p>
<p>二千塊錢</p>

<h3>以包攬訴訟恐嚇取財為常業孫少卿等獲罪理由</h3>
<p>分贓不勻引起公訴　法院懲儆訟棍聽者</p>
<p>已革包探南通人孫少卿、糾黨江肇周、合組曙光法律事務所專以包攬訴訟恐嚇取財為常業、比年以來敲詐所得為數頗鉅、邇因分贓不勻被江提起自訴、迨經第特區地方法院發交捕房偵查、江乃畏罪逃逸、係及其妻朱氏、則被拘案、研訊確實、判决孫犯連續恐嚇取財罪、處有期徒刑五年、併科罰金一千元、褫奪公權十年、孫朱氏犯偽證罪、處有期徒刑一年、其被訴包攬訴訟漁利、及恐嚇取財部份無罪、據聞包攬訴訟、雖向經官廳縣為厲禁、然在舊刑法時代、因法文內無此項罪名之規定、故鮮有受懲罰者自新刑法頒行後、第一特院當局、監於市內</p>
<p>訟棍繁多</p>
<p>若輩輙以代請律師、提起自訴為詐財之初步行動、倘對方不為所懾、則以種種恐嚇手投繼之、如寫恐嚇信致對方、或向對方打恐嚇言詞之電話、更或向對方之代理律師、作種種侮辱之舉動、總以達敲詐目的而後止、孫少鄉在此五六年間彼以此種技倆所得金錢、不下數、萬這鉅、其類乎孫之舉動、而手腕較遜於孫者、似猶不乏其人、法院當局為冀若輩悛悔歛跡起見、前曾迭申告誡、嚴切諭禁、奈其利慾薰心甘蹈注網、此次孫案之發覺、本由其同黨江肇周之自訴法院據狀、以所情節皆屬公訴範圍、除將該自訴、判不受理外、爰着總巡捕房依法偵查、旋經陸督察長督同探員偵查之下、始發覺孫少卿與在逃之江肇周、自民國二十年冬、至上年三月止、廣結黨羽專以</p>
<p>包攬訴訟</p>
<p>為常業並施用恐嚇手段敲詐得㊁吳登瀛四萬元、而僅分結吳妹孫氏一萬二千五百元、餘欵悉被鯨吞、該氏心有不甘、曾致函湖社委員會聲述、㊁周湘雲七萬元、而僅分給吳月娥五千元、餘悉與唐嘉鵬吞沒、㊂施德之四萬元、㊃陸冠曾六萬七千元、而僅分給陸翥雙三萬元、餘悉亁沒、㊄徐懋昌兩萬元、而僅分給坤伶潘雪艷之母潘趙氏三千元、㊅蔣楊氏四萬七千元、以上</p>
<p>被詐六戶</p>
<p>當時均因畏懼孫等之種種恐嚇行為、祇得犧牲巨資、寗息訟爭、今經捕房搜集一應證據、依法連同孫妻一併提起公訴、經刑庭長錢鴻業、訊明論罪、被害者聞之、莫不稱怏、是案判决書、詳敘被告犯罪經過、鉅細靡遺、</p>
<p>洋洋千言</p>
<p>首述孫少卿與江肇周等、先後向前列六人、如何以孫吳氏•吳月娥•施道世•陸翥雙•潘雪艷•蔣國培•等名義•代請律師、提起分析遺產賠償損失等訴訟、如何打恐嚇電話威脅各該案被告出資和解之種種經過事實、均認孫等連續犯罪行為雖其狡賴不承、但經各案人證物證之證明、確係包攬訴訟、恐嚇取財及虛構證言、到庭偽證之罪犯、末論科刑之理由、大旨謂就以上六案參互以觀、則孫少卿共同以意圖漁利、包攬他人訴訟為常業、並連續恐嚇取財、已屬證據確鑿、毫無疑義、雖其犯罪時間、在民國二十四年七月一日以前者、計有數案彼時新刑法尚未頒行、舊刑法並無意圖漁利包攬他人訴訟、罪名應在不罰之列、然新刑法施行以後旣已</p>
<p>連犯數案</p>
<p>日係以此為常業、則於其罪名之成立、仍無何等影響、况查該被告之包攬他人訴訟、又與恐嚇取財有方法給果關係、舊刑法時代、雖無包攬訴訟罪名、而其處罰恐嚇取財之行為、則與新刑法係屬一致、故在舊刑法時代所犯各案、應以單純恐嚇取財論罪、惟其行為旣已連續、至新刑法施行以後、而連續犯又應以一罪論、自應從新刑法論科、察核恐嚇罪名、又比包攬訴訟為重、故依</p>
<p>恐嚇取財</p>
<p>宣告罪刑、至捕房起訴、該被告於民國二十年一月初、代表姚月波向其姪姚志春訛索一案、僅足為該被告包攬漁利之證明、當時新刑法尚未頒行、自可毋庸論斷被告孫朱氏、雖係孫少卿之妻、對於孫少卿之包攬訴訟漁利、連續恐嚇取財、固雖謂非知情、但是否共同計劃、推出孫少卿為實施之人、亦無何種證據、足資證明、除</p>
<p>偽證部份</p>

<h3>烟斗</h3>
<p>— 方黑</p>
<p>一位英國人告訴我：烟斗也有生命和死。</p>
<p>一個月之後，她是友愛的。</p>
<p>兩個月之後，她是甜蜜的。</p>
<p>六個月之後，她是蠱惑的。</p>
<p>十二個月之後，她是厭倦的。</p>
<p>烟斗正像婦人一樣。</p>
<p>——恩斯特托勒的手記</p>
<p>久為烟草所薰黃的手現在却習慣了握烟斗的姿勢。我新買來的烟斗是粘土燒成的，肥大而笨重，啣在嘴犄角上是一種煩累。但是啖着辛辣的烟味和噴着花白的烟圈的時候，却另有深湛的意味。那是不為沒有體念過的人所知道的。</p>
<p>我抽濃烈的烟捲。因為太繁重的工作，也因為太空闊的時間：在街上躑躅着的時候，忙亂着的時候，和當關起房間而寂寞起來的時候。我的房間是曾充滿着朋友們的明朗的笑聲的，且交換着烟捲對於康健無益的話。但終於是跟一支烟一同地生活下來了。</p>
<p>我也想扔了手指間的烟蒂而永遠不再拾起來，有時保持了半天的決心：但往往有一種念頭像老朋友似地跑了來，於是我又被說服了，一支燃着的烟又很快地啣在我的嘴唇上，讓尼古丁繼續使腦筋麻醉，繼續使腦筋清醒。</p>
<p>曾浪費過過多的苦心，但全歸於枉然。</p>
<p>於是在古暗的日子裏，我為空闊的時間所惱。偶然看見一大堆烟捲的紙包，烟灰缸裏的燒殘了的烟蒂，不禁暗然失笑了。</p>
<p>生活總是這樣平凡，把烟啣在嘴邊，抽不完地抽着，噴着不休息的烟圈。</p>
<p>現在我已经扔了手指间的烟蒂，但久為烟草所薰黃的手却習慣了握烟斗的姿勢。因為我歡喜精緻的烟斗，它有生命和死，對於抽烟斗的人它正像婦人一樣，由友愛而甜蜜，而蠱惑終於遭到厭倦。也許會被遺棄在抽屜的角落裏，塵封，腐敝甚至為蠱所穿蝕。</p>
<p>但我現在是握着新買來的烟斗，板烟盒子的蓋被揭開了，我把粗黑的廉價烟葉裝在烟斗裏，像舉行一種隆重的儀式似地劃了一根火柴燃上了，懷着惴惴的期望抽了一口，烟味却是苦的，於我是太濃烈，也太辛辣。</p>
<p>我將熟習了這辛辣和苦味，我想。因為起初烟斗是友愛的。一個瞬間出現的婦人也許奈人索味，但熟習了這婦人也許會沒來由地厭倦起來，在十二個月之後，即再短暫些也說不定。</p>
<p>人生不是啣着淡純的烟捲過去的，乃是啖着辛辣而苦的烟味和噴着花白的烟圈而消磨的。讓人在苦味中鍛煉自己，磨難自己和消滅自己。</p>
<p>暫時，我握着烟斗而滿意着，在我忙亂着的時候，走在街上的時候，把自己關在黑暗的房間裏的時候。待厭倦了烟斗的握法的那一天，再拾起久已扔開的烟蒂。</p>
<p>烟斗，像一個婦人一樣，將使我熟習了辛辣和苦味。</p>
<p>我這樣想。</p>
<h3>邊塞</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<p>朋友淑逛了八達嶺之後，給我寄來了一張明信片，這卡片的正面是八達嶺的小影，反面是淑題的幾個字：“明：我給你這張明信片，你看，塞外的風雲不是已變色了麼？”</p>
<p>我凝望着那畫裏的八達嶺，那起伏而蜿蜒的長城。這風光在我是很熟悉的，三年前的春節，我也曾站在長城上，懷着無限感慨的心情，憑弔那偉大的建築，看北風挾着黃沙撫摸着那傾圯的雉樓。</p>
<p>我恍惚看見當年塞外的風光，胡人成羣騎着壯馬，在風沙中馳逐着，他們說着吚啞的異邦的話語，吹着令人悽然折腸的盛樂。他們也會同夥伴們仰望着這高不可越的巨城，用馬鞭遙指遠處近處衝天的烽火，做着他們併吞錦繡的中原的誓盟，入夜，他們便在風嘶馬鳴中，枕在馬鞍上，做着帝王與英雄之夢。……</p>
<p>然而，塞外已沒有胡人的蹤跡，碉樓砲壘，雉堞箭𣐟，都己傾圯，往時兀立的烽火樓也已變成一堆泥土，只有風沙䆳依然如當年的胡騎和歌聲，在塞外奔突着，但風雲也已變色了，風雲已經變色了！</p>
<p>現在黃帝的子孫登臨這絕世的建築時，巳失去他們的傲氣，他們低着頭，因風雲的變色而凄然泣下。他們已看不見當年守城逐胡的壯士，也看不見烽火：聽不見兵器擊撞的叮噹聲，也聽不見激戰的怒號，只有獵獵的天風捲着塞外的黃土，衝過這高城，瀰漫着中原，瀰漫着那昔日號稱天國的中原……</p>
<p>塞外的風雲是變色了！</p>
<p>你看，長城也為着他昔日的榮光而歎息，黃金時代已過去了，現在正是苦難的時節，有如一個龍鍾的老人，看見敵騎來襲，但不能掙扎反攻，只能眼見敵騎跨身而過。他回憶着往古那執槍荷戟的戰士，即使面前有漫山遍野的胡人，他仍然浴血而戰。於是，你便聽到他的低微的嘆息：</p>
<p>“黃帝的子孫死去了麼？偌大的中原，沒有－個執干戈衛社稷的勇士？而胡人已經再來了！”</p>
<p>灰沙從他的身上撒下來，砲壘雉堞在風中沙沙地卸下他的碎片，這就是他的低微的嘆息。</p>
<p>然而，我知道黃帝的子孫絕不會辜負我們這民族的老邁的衛土，這老態龍鍾的長城。終有一天，塞外會點着無數的狼烟，黃帝的子孫將毅然執着干戈，前仆後繼，為着往古的榮光而效死疆塲的。現在風雲變色，是風暴將來的表徵，新的獨立自由的中國已是不遠了。</p>

<h3>Ambassador Kawagoe Discusses Sino-Japanese Issues</h3>
<p>Denies Economic Cooperation as Promotion of National Defense Plans. Smuggling Should be Discussed with Local Japanese Foreign Affairs Agencies.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A reporter visited Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe on the 15th at noon. The reporter raised several questions regarding Sino-Japanese issues, and he answered them one by one. The following is a brief record of his remarks: Kawagoe said that the news of Mr. Kodama's visit to China was only heard in the newspapers, and he was not yet aware of the facts. However, recently some people in his country have advocated that envoys abroad should be selected from economic leaders. If this were to be realized, then Mr. Kodama would be a suitable candidate. If it is said that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is a movement by Japan to promote its national defense plans and obtain raw materials, then I strongly deny this. Economic cooperation is to enable the national economies of both countries to benefit and the people's lives to be secure. As for the saying that political obstacles should be removed before discussing economic cooperation, although it is reasonable, sometimes economic cooperation can also be a prerequisite for solving political problems. You said that the recent smuggling of copper coins is the same in nature as the past smuggling of silver, and can be handled by Japanese consuls in China according to precedent, and the smuggling can be curbed. I also believe that this is a local issue. If the relevant aspects of your country consult with the Japanese foreign affairs agencies stationed in the area, they may still be able to obtain their assistance. As for smuggling in North China, there are special circumstances and it cannot be generalized. As for the Hebei-Chahar Political Council issue, theoretically it is a domestic issue of your country. I personally hope that when the overall relations between the two countries are restored to a close state, Japan will definitely be able to provide considerable assistance. As for the speech by Foreign Minister Sato, saying that Japan can freely choose whether to reject or welcome the war crisis, it is a misunderstanding from the outside world. The Foreign Minister's original intention was to explain that Japan must work hard to avoid the dangers of future wars. As for Japan's recent actions in managing national defense, it is now a defensive measure, and it is nothing more than the result of the Soviet Union's repeated increase in its Far East military buildup. It is heard that the newly appointed Japanese Counselor Hidaka will arrive on the 24th or 25th of this month, so Kawagoe's trip back to his country to report on his work has been set for the end of this month.

In the past, when the river was high, backflow caused disasters, and the lakes and rivers gradually silted up, harming the surrounding areas. The Water Conservancy Commission investigated the actual situation of the waterways, and made improvements. The project included spillway gates, flood discharge channels, river dams, and the construction of surrounding lake embankments. The total project required approximately 5 million yuan. The first step was to build the spillway gates and river dams. Construction began in November last year, and work was rushed day and night. The river dam must be completed before the major floods, and the closure can be completed by the end of the month. 20,000 cubic meters of stone pitching is required. The spillway gates are also scheduled to be completed in September. After the entire project is completed in the future: (1) The backflow and siltation of the river and the lakes can be avoided, (2) When the river level rises high, the flood can be diverted into the lake through the flood discharge channel, (3) At ordinary high water levels, backflow will be completely prevented, so as to avoid flooding in the area, (4) After the embankments are completed, the beach land along the lake will be permanently free from floods.

<h3>On the Trial Implementation of Compulsory Education</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The National Committee for Universal Education held a meeting at the Ministry of Education yesterday. Regarding methods for promoting universal education, a variety of proposals were formulated, including the planning of local education funds, the allocation of central education funds, the evaluation and rewarding of those managing education, and the strengthening of the organization of education committees at all levels and the determination of their work. All proposals were carefully considered based on circumstances. Among these proposals, the trial implementation of compulsory enrollment is particularly noteworthy. The enlightenment of the people's minds is vital to the foundation of the nation. Education is the key to awakening the ignorant. However, when autocratic ideas trumped everything else, emperors sought to perpetuate their rule by acting unilaterally, even resorting to policies of keeping the people ignorant to control their ears and eyes. In contrast, enlightened nations around the world consider the promotion of education a prerequisite for national development. The rapid transformation of public sentiment in China in recent years can also be attributed to the promotion of education. However, due to China's vast territory and complex environment, with stark disparities between rural and urban areas and uneven development being commonplace, achieving universal education is difficult. Therefore, even today, it is still necessary to resort to compulsory means, which is a deeply regrettable situation.</p>
<p>The education authorities have had a six-year plan to eliminate illiteracy nationwide for several years and now have the universal education committee to promote with compulsory measures. Their hard work is commendable and should be acknowledged by the entire nation. However, the implementation procedures, talent training, resource allocation, and remediation of malpractices should all be carefully considered. In remote rural areas, local customs are isolated, and people are of varying quality. Obstinate Confucian scholars also exist. If they already have a desire to learn but are limited by finances, the establishment of free education will be sufficient to attract them. Persuasion is sufficient, without the need for compulsion. However, if they turn a blind eye and refuse to be recruited, it is clear that they have no desire to learn, perhaps due to the busyness of farming or other difficulties preventing them from leaving home. In such cases, it is necessary to work with the Baojia system to investigate the facts, explain the regulations, and provide flexible arrangements that suit their convenience. In explaining to them, it is important to be calm, patient, and clear, aiming to fulfill the purpose of compulsion without being reckless. Otherwise, minor misunderstandings can easily lead to conflicts. One wrong move can spoil everything. The strong may resist with arms, while the weak may run away in fear. This would violate the system and damage relationships. The original intention was to make progress, but it would instead create obstacles, which would be counterproductive. As for the teaching materials, they should be specially compiled, adapted to local conditions, and tailored to their needs. The language should be simple, and the meaning should be clear. Novel ideas and profound theories should be eliminated to avoid barriers. Furthermore, those who teach should fully understand the level of the students and constantly improve their teaching materials. If they can conveniently impart basic health knowledge and show necessary specimens for verification, it will be easier to gain trust. If they can briefly explain the country’s situation and point out the ways to succeed, it will be beneficial. All these are simple and easy to arrange. The responsible authorities must provide clear instructions and strictly monitor the implementation to prevent corruption, ensuring that public funds are not wasted, no one is left behind, words are not spoken in vain, and actions are effective. The plan to eliminate illiteracy can then be completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>Finally, one point should be emphasized. Funding is the foundation for promoting all endeavors, and universal education in particular should have a definite source of funds. The authorities have thoroughly discussed this point, so there is no need to worry. It is hoped that everyone will fulfill their responsibilities and do their utmost to maintain the designated use of funds and absolutely prevent misappropriation. This will ensure that the promotion of universal education will not be abandoned halfway. At yesterday's annual meeting of foreign taxpayers in the Shanghai International Settlement, taxpayer Bauer generously advocated that the Municipal Council could tighten other expenditures but should strive to ensure the adequacy of education funds. Well said! Our education authorities should remember this and carefully consider it.</p>

I met a certain Chinese military attaché on the ship, who told me about the various advances that China is currently realizing, saying that China, under the leadership of General Chiang Kai-shek and with the cooperation of Wang Jingwei, is immersed in construction. Regarding transportation alone, given China's vast size, the development of transportation is of utmost importance. Now, whether it is railways, highways, or aviation, all are prospering and greatly improved. All other economic sectors have not been neglected either. The military attaché also emphasized that after I arrive in China and see the current situation for myself, it will be completely different from when I last went to China, and I will be surprised. The technical personnel sent to China by the League of Nations are, in fact, partly responsible for this." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Civil War Losses Cannot Be Recovered in Eighty Years</h3>
<p>Hundreds of Thousands of Basques Await Death, London Again Hears of Mediation Efforts</p>
<p>[Paris] Neutral sources today estimate that since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, material losses have reached US$1,740,000,000. Even if the war ends immediately and agriculture and industry return to their original state immediately, it will not be possible to recover in less than eighty years. However, there is no hope that agriculture and industry will recover immediately. (15th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Basque military authorities in Spain announced today that 450,000 people along the coast of the Bay of Biscay are currently awaiting death due to lack of food. The 6,000 tons of food blocked in France by the rebel blockade are too much. (14th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Valencia: Foreign Minister Fabert recently gave a broadcast speech to the people in the territory controlled by the National Army, stating, "The rebel leaders have betrayed the country and are being driven by Germany and Italy. You are merely tools for these people. The rebels' plan to capture the Madrid line has failed. In other fronts, they have also been defeated. If you can abandon your errors and turn to the right path, and come back together, you can save your lives." (Havas, 14th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The Daily Mail recently reported that "a conspiracy has recently occurred in Spain to overthrow both the Valencia Republican government and the Burgos Nationalist government, replacing them with a detached military dictatorship in order to eliminate the civil war. The leader of the new government is said to be General Miagia, chairman of the Madrid City Defense Committee. The initiators of this plan are detached politicians and overseas merchants, who deeply believe that neither side can achieve complete victory in this civil war without plunging the country into total ruin. The resulting white terror or red terror is not good for the country. They are secretly contacting the military leaders of both the government army and the National Army to test opinions. Once an agreement is reached, they will force Premier Kabarero of the Republican government cabinet and General Franco, commander-in-chief of the National Army, to resign simultaneously, thereby forming an internal affairs cabinet.” (Central News Agency, 15th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Key figures in the left-wing political circles here today reported that the plan to mediate the Spanish Civil War has now been submitted to the government army and the rebel authorities, advocating that a dictatorship government should first be organized by neutral Spanish generals, and the aftermath problems should be discussed slowly. Both sides initially agreed, but there is no guarantee that it will ultimately succeed. (15th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[London] The Non-Intervention Committee today approved the plan for full Spanish maritime and land surveillance, which will begin at midnight on the 19th of this month. (15th National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>British Labor Party Censures Government's Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>Already Rejected by the House of Commons, Simon Defends Compromise Policy</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the blockade of Bilbao port on the northern coast of Spain by the National Army, Prime Minister Baldwin declared to the House of Commons that the government had warned British ships not to enter the port. Opposition Labor Party leader Atlee was greatly dissatisfied with this and today specifically filed a case in the House of Commons censuring the government for dereliction of duty and failure to protect British merchant ships. After a vote, it was rejected by 345 votes to 130.</p>
<p>In his speech today, Atlee said that the government's actions were actually condoning atrocities that greatly violate international law and presented a telegram from the chairman of the Basque Republican government to prove the government's misconduct. The telegram stated that neither the Basques nor the rebels had laid mines at the Bilbao port entrance. In the first half of April, a total of 58 ships entered and exited the port without being disturbed. The Bilbao artillery had forced the rebel fleet to sail 15 miles away from the coast. Home Secretary Sir Simon answered for the government and was repeatedly interrupted by anger. Simon said that the government's policy was aimed at avoiding all disputes that could harm good international relations and to refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of Spain. During Simon's speech, Labor Party members made comments or sarcastic calls, almost without interruption. Simon continued to say that according to a report from the British warship Blanche on April 6, the port of Bilbao had been strictly blockaded, and if merchant ships attempted to enter, it would cause major incidents. Simon commented that the British warship captain on the spot was more reliable than the Basque government. This remark again aroused the anger of the opposition party. When the opposition party requested the announcement of the original telegram issued by the Ministry of Commerce warning British merchant ships not to enter the port of Bilbao, there was another uproar in the room. Simon continued, saying that the navy could forcibly enter the port with a large number of minesweepers, but this would abandon the non-intervention policy. Simon answered Lloyd George's question, saying that if British merchant ships were attacked by warships of the National Army, the British Navy would protect them. A highlight of today's debate was Churchill's speech. After supporting the government, Churchill suggested that if Britain submitted the issue to Moscow, the Soviet Union would say that what is most needed in the future is that the Spanish government should not be national socialist or fascist. Then Hitler may promise not to insist on Spain implementing national socialism, and Mussolini will certainly be satisfied not to be biased towards the Spanish government. Then Britain and France can apply to engage in a purely Spanish solution. The five countries can propose the following solutions to the Spanish people, which should be implemented in three stages over six years: (1) A period of peace to allow intense enthusiasm to gradually cool down. (2) A period of reconciliation, with a mixed government established. (3) Restore the parliamentary system. If both parties reject this proposal, the war will continue. If one party rejects and the other accepts, the major powers should support the accepting party.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Eden then took the floor and recalled that when the Spanish government announced the blockade of the National Army's Moroccan ports in August of last year, Britain did not protest. He said that we cannot give the rights of belligerents to either party now. If Britain follows the previous example and allows them the rights of belligerents, both parties can arrest and sabotage British ships that break the blockade, even in international waters.</p>
<p>Liberal Party leader Sinclair first asked if British Navy would protect British ships if they ignored the warning and were attacked before reaching the three-mile limit. The Foreign Minister replied that it would protect them, but the government was responsible for warning all ships of the dangers off the coast of Bilbao, and because of these dangers, it could not guarantee the safety of ships in Bilbao's territorial waters.</p>
<p>The Foreign Minister also quoted a telegram from the British consul in Bilbao, which stated that there had been bombings every day for the past two weeks, causing great damage. He also quoted a telegram from the Shipowners Parliamentary Committee, which stated that they were very satisfied with the government's efforts to protect shipping. The Foreign Minister continued that if it was necessary to clear mines outside Spanish territorial waters to protect British shipping, the government would of course consider it. However, this was a very important task, and taking forced action in Spanish territorial waters would be tantamount to intervention. The Foreign Minister finally mentioned Churchill's request, saying that if Britain could make a contribution to ending the war, it would do so with enthusiasm.

<h3>Spanish War Ends in Stalemate Between the Two Armies</h3>
<p>Republic Anniversary Passed Sadly</p>
<p>Madrid: Because the government army's general offensive for six days has failed, the rebel army near the city took advantage of the opportunity to launch an offensive in the vicinity of the former royal garden and the university area today, but the war is still in a stalemate. As of now, the battle lines of both armies have not changed. (15th National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Defense Committee recently issued a communique stating that the rebel army repeatedly counterattacked in the university area in the western suburbs, attempting to drive our army out of the area and prevent it from continuing to exert pressure, but it was repelled by our army.

<p>Andai: A naval battle is feared to break out in the Bay of Biscay at any moment. According to news received here, several Spanish government warships are now heading towards the Bay of Biscay. The National Army warships will definitely meet the enemy. (Central News Agency, 14th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Valencia: Today is the sixth anniversary of the founding of the Spanish Republic, but because the civil strife has not subsided and the army is busy, the government and all unions do not want to celebrate the National Day in a flamboyant manner. Today, all stores in the city are not closed, and the working class is working as usual and decided to donate the wages earned today to the hospital for the need of rescuing the wounded soldiers. As for the official celebration ceremony, it is also very simple. President Acha arrived here from Barcelona City last night and will meet with the ministers of the government, the diplomatic corps, the representatives of the army and navy, the leaders of the various trade unions and political parties, and the mayor of the city this morning to celebrate the National Day. Four British members of parliament also went to congratulate. The Army Department and the Navy Department have instructed the soldiers on the front line to express their encouragement.

<h3>Egypt Abolishes Extraterritoriality</h3>
<p>Discussing the Transition Period</p>
<p>Montreal: The conference on Egypt's abolition of consular jurisdiction discussed the transition period this morning, which is one of the most important items on the agenda. France advocated for eighteen years, while Egypt only allowed twelve years. A compromise of approximately fifteen years may be acceptable to all parties. France proposed an amendment, advocating that the transition period be divided into three stages: ㊀ Maintaining the status quo, with foreign judges being replaced by foreigners when vacancies occur; ㊁ Gradually reducing the number of foreign judges to one-third; ㊂ Dismissing all foreign judges. The United States proposed adding a clause to the draft treaty based on the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, stating that the King of Egypt guarantees not to implement any discriminatory legislation against any foreigners. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>Montreal: The General Committee of the International Conference on the abolition of consular jurisdiction in Egypt continued its meeting today. It was decided to postpone discussion of Article 2 of the draft agreement proposed by the Egyptian delegation (stipulating the number of Egyptian and foreign members of the Mixed Courts) and begin discussion of Article 3. The French delegation advocated that the transition period should be set at eighteen years, divided into three stages, with six years per stage. The Belgian and Italian delegations both agreed. The British, American, Portuguese, and Danish delegations supported the original proposal of the Egyptian delegation, believing that the transition period should be set at twelve years. The meeting was then adjourned until tomorrow for further discussion. (Dispatch from Havas of the Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>Montreal: The consular jurisdiction conference discussed this morning the issue of the transition period before the abolition of the Egyptian Mixed Courts. The Egyptian representative advocated for twelve years, while the French representative advocated for eighteen years. The Italian representative proposed a compromise solution, but no agreement was reached. The second item of the Egyptian plan, stipulating that foreigners should absolutely obey Egyptian law, has also been postponed for discussion. (National Maritime News dispatch on the 15th)</p>
<p>Montreal: The conference on Egypt's abolition of consular jurisdiction began studying this afternoon the new organization of the Egyptian Mixed Courts in the future. Various technical issues will be submitted for discussion, which will take a considerable amount of time before a decision can be reached. Members of the Egyptian delegation are very satisfied because the conference has already passed the principle of abolishing consular jurisdiction this morning.

<h3>US-Philippine Committee Schedules Meeting</h3>
<p>US Representatives Appointed for the 19th of Next Month</p>
<p>[Washington] The United States' representatives to the Joint Philippine-American Committee to investigate the early date of Philippine independence have been announced by Undersecretary of State Sayre. The chief commissioner will be Sayre himself, and the other commissioners are as follows: ㊀ Jacobs, Director of the Philippine Affairs Bureau of the Department of State; ㊁ Domeratzky, Chief of the Regional Information Bureau of the Department of Commerce; ㊂ Emminger, Chief of Economic Analysis in the Commercial Agreements Section of the Department of State; ㊃ McDonald, Assistant Director of the Bureau of Insular Affairs; ㊄ Robbins, Assistant Chief of the Sugar Section of the Agricultural Adjustment Administration; ㊅ Warring, economic expert of the Tariff Commission.

The American commissioners will be chaired by Jacobs, and the joint meetings will be chaired by Sayre. When the Department of State announced the above list of candidates, it also stated that the committee's responsibility is to study the commercial relations between the United States and the Philippines and to recommend adjustments to the Philippine economy in preparation for the termination of preferential commercial relations between the two countries. The statement did not mention the President's views on shortening the period of Philippine self-government. (National News dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>[London] The Associated Press has learned from reliable sources that the Philippines' initial diplomatic efforts at the London Sugar Conference have been quite successful. All countries fully support the Philippines' proposal, which will be included in the Executive Committee's general proposal and distributed to the delegations next week. The most important of the Philippines' proposals is to request that all countries treat the commercial relations between the Philippines and the United States as not being within the scope of ordinary most-favored-nation clauses. Ten countries have already agreed, six of which are attending this conference. If a sugar agreement can be reached, the other seventeen countries participating in the conference will also recognize this point, and after the Philippines becomes independent in the future, if it establishes a special commercial relationship with the United States, there will be no technical obstacles.

<h3>Germany Willing to Cooperate with All Countries to Revive the World Economy</h3>
<p>Schacht Makes a Declaration in Belgium; Britain Does Not Intend to Negotiate Tariff Reductions</p>
<p>Brussels: Dr. Schacht, President of the Deutsche Bank and Acting Minister of Economics, met with representatives of the press today. A reporter asked whether the German government intends to continue rejecting the Soviet Union's participation in the European Pact. Dr. Schacht replied that this was not the case. Germany now has important trade with the Soviet Union, and he hopes that trade between the two countries will develop further. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Dr. Schacht, the German Minister of Economics and President of the Central Bank, stated in a speech to the press that he was very satisfied with his visit and that he had not formally negotiated with Prime Minister Zeeland, but had only reviewed the general economic situation. He believes that if the international economic situation is to improve, various political problems must be resolved first. All countries, large and small, should reach an understanding. He also firmly believes that no country in Europe wants to engage in war, and that we now have more hope of finding a solution than before. He sincerely hopes that Prime Minister Zeeland's task will be successfully completed, but the economic improvements that Prime Minister Zeeland is trying to achieve must be preceded by a period of easing the current situation. Prime Minister Zeeland will soon understand this. He also said that Germany is prepared to cooperate with all countries to seek the revival of the world economy. This cooperation cannot exclude any country. The current active trade between Germany and Russia can be seen as an example. "If this economic recovery depends on currency reform, then Germany is also prepared to reform its own currency. This is why I have maintained the stability of the Mark until now. But what we also need is to conclude international agreements and stipulate the exchange rates of various countries' currencies, so that the short-term transactions currently being carried out by various countries can be changed into long-term transactions." Finally, Schacht stated that he opposes the devaluation of gold and that he does not intend to go to London, but will only travel to Paris on May 5th to preside over the opening ceremony of the German Pavilion at the Paris International Exposition. (Dispatch from Havas of the Central News Agency on the 14th)</p>
<p>Brussels: The talks conducted by Dr. Schacht, the German Minister of Economics and President of the Central Bank, with Belgian authorities yesterday can be divided into two parts: one is commercial issues, and the other is European and world issues. Dr. Schacht believes that economic recovery must first ease the political situation. If a majority of countries can issue a declaration of peace, the political situation can be eased, and Germany can also make demands regarding the redistribution of raw materials and the restoration of old colonies. It seems that Dr. Schacht has seriously discussed political issues. However, Belgian political figures believe that the redistribution of raw materials is practically impossible to achieve, and the Belgian government's position on the colonial issue is also contrary to Germany's wishes, so it is unlikely to be successful. As for the issues directly concerning Belgium and Germany, Belgium hopes to improve bilateral trade relations to make the balance of payments more favorable than with the Group of Seven countries. Germany only wants to earn raw materials by selling finished products and does not want to discuss this matter. (Dispatch from Havas of the Central News Agency on the 13th)</p>
<p>Brussels: Well-informed sources claim that the talks conducted by German Economics Minister Dr. Schacht here yesterday focused on exploring opinions, especially regarding the investigation entrusted to Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland by the British and French governments. Various political issues were only briefly touched upon. As for Germany's purchase of raw materials from Belgium, it has encountered difficulties due to Germany's lack of foreign currency. The result of Dr. Schacht's trip is only secondary and there are no major achievements. (Dispatch from Havas of the Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>[London] Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain made a statement in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that he does not intend to start negotiations to reduce various obstacles to international trade. After this statement was made, financial figures said that negotiations to reduce tariff barriers have been postponed and are still a long way off. Regarding these negotiations, Britain argues that they can be divided into three items: ㊀ The exchange rates of various countries' currencies should be more stable; ㊀ The Imperial Conference will be held next month, and we should wait for the results of the conference; ㊂ Britain is willing to sign a commercial treaty with the United States first. In summary, the investigation work entrusted to Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland by Britain and France is purely preparatory and theoretical, not practical. Even the success of the World Sugar Conference is only a speculation. (Dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Economics Minister and President of the Central Bank Dr. Schacht returned here from the Belgian capital by plane at 9:48 this morning.

<h3>Mussolini Reportedly to Visit Germany</h3>
<p>Meeting with Hitler</p>
<p>[Rome] Well-informed sources have recently claimed that after Prime Minister Mussolini meets with Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg in Venice on the 24th of this month, he may go to Germany on the same day to meet with the German leader Hitler. Leader Hitler visited Italy in 1934, and Prime Minister Mussolini is returning the visit. The talks to be conducted at that time will be limited to promoting friendly relations between the two sides and will not involve other matters. In addition, several key figures in the German government, such as Foreign Minister Neurath, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and Aviation Minister General Göring, will also be formally invited to visit Italy. Dr. Ley, the leader of the German Labor Front, has already arrived in Rome and is still under investigation. (Dispatch from Havas of the Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>[Rome] After arriving here, Dr. Ley, the leader of the German Labor Front, paid a visit to Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday afternoon. The Italian government also presented him with a third-class medal. He then visited the Confederation of Industry and the Industrial Workers' Union.

<h3>Austrian Prime Minister Speaks on Basic Policy</h3>
<p>Visiting Italy on the 22nd</p>
<p>[Vienna] Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg spoke to the political world in Bergen about the basic principles of Austrian policy. It is a completely wrong view that Austria should either unite with Germany or restore the royal family. He said that the Austrian authorities will obtain greater powers to deal with radicals or suggest that the "Fatherland Front" be allowed to take independent action in times of emergency. He insisted that the issue of the form of government should be determined by the development process, and that the independence of Austria should not be interfered with in the development process.

<p>[Vienna] It has been learned that Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Schmidt will go to Venice, Italy on the 22nd of this month to hold talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. (Dispatch from Havas of the Central News Agency on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg is scheduled to come to the port of Venice on the 24th of this month to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. The reason why the meeting place is not in Rome is because Schuschnigg does not want to publicize it too much. As for the Italian side, it would prefer to meet in Rome. Italy has recently been approaching the Little Entente countries. The goal of Schuschnigg's trip is obviously to clarify the relations between Italy and Austria. Regarding this, the Rome Protocols established by Italy, Austria, and Hungary are still in effect. However, on the surface, Italy's resistance to Germany's expansion of power in Austria has gradually weakened. If Italy and Germany have agreed on the scope of activities, that is, Germany focuses on Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula, and Italy focuses on the Mediterranean, Prime Minister Schuschnigg wants to find out the truth.

According to a statement released by the Avala News Agency, the results of the talks between the Yugoslav and Turkish authorities in recent days have proven that the interests of the two countries are completely consistent. As for the international obligations undertaken by the two countries under various treaties, they are also fully in line with the spirit of the Balkan Entente Pact and the League of Nations Covenant.

<h3>Britain Still Complies with the Locarno Treaty</h3>
<p>Belgium's Attitude Still Hesitant</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons met today. A member asked whether Britain is still bound by the Locarno Treaty, given that Germany does not recognize the Locarno Treaty and Belgium will withdraw from the obligations of the treaty. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that the British government is still bound by Section 1 of Chapter 3 of the agreement of March 19, 1936. In this section, the British government announced its obligations to France and Belgium, that is, any matters that occurred before or after the violation of the Locarno Treaty cannot be regarded as exempting the signatory countries from any of their obligations or guarantees (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 14th)</p>
<p>[London] The British and French governments previously agreed to issue a joint declaration to release Belgium from the obligations of a guarantor state stipulated in the Locarno Treaty and the obligations stipulated in the British, French, and Belgian General Staff agreement of September 1936, and the Belgian government will submit a reply stating that the country has restored freedom of action, but will still abide by the obligations contained in the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>It is now generally believed that this declaration by the British and French governments will be made next week before Eden visits Belgium (announced on the 25th of this month. Currently, diplomatic figures firmly believe that Belgium should submit a reply so that the reply can be issued at the same time as the British and French declarations. However, the Belgian government may be hesitant because the proposed reply mentions Belgium's obligations as a member of the League of Nations. If this is the case, then the sanctions measures contained in Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, if implemented, will require Belgium to automatically and mechanically allow foreign troops to pass through its borders, so it is still hesitant and unwilling to submit a reply immediately.

<h3>Canadian Labor Strike Causes Political Disputes</h3>
<p>Two Ministers in a Certain Province Resign; Prime Minister Declares Non-Interference; American Labor Strike Still Spreading</p>
<p>Toronto: Canadian Ontario Labor Minister Croll and Justice Minister Roebuck have resigned at the request of Premier Hepburn due to disagreements over the government's handling of the General Motors strike in Oshawa. At the same time, General Motors factories in the United States are also facing the threat of strikes. A representative of the Committee for Industrial Organization in Oshawa declared that if Oshawa is building British cars and cannot deliver them due to the strike, and the United States ships goods to Britain to replace them, then workers at General Motors factories in the United States will begin a sit-down strike. Canadian Prime Minister King declared in Ottawa today that the Canadian government does not want to interfere in the labor strike unless interference is expected to be beneficial. This statement was made in response to Mayor Hall of Oshawa's earnest request for interference. Hall also telegraphed Martin, president of the United Automobile Workers of America, requesting that if the Canadian dispute cannot be resolved, a strike should be announced at all General Motors factories in the United States on Sunday, otherwise he will convene a meeting of workers at the Oshawa factory to inform them that they are being fooled and that the union is not helping them. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>
<p>Oshawa: After a labor strike occurred at the General Motors factory (a branch of the American General Motors Company) in this city, Premier Hepburn of the provincial cabinet immediately issued a statement that he would assist the company with the power of the provincial government and accused Lewis, chairman of the American Committee for Industrial Progress, of not interfering in the Canadian labor movement. However, Labor Minister Croll strongly disagreed, believing that this kind of action could make the provincial government a "strike-breaking machine," which caused a disagreement with Premier Hepburn and resigned at the Premier's request. Various labor organizations in the province have requested that various American unions declare a sympathy strike to show support and are waiting for a reply. Whether American unions can do this is a touchstone for whether international unionism can take effect. (Dispatch from Havas of the Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Advocates Peace in Speech</h3>
<p>Pan American Union Holds Commemorative Banquet</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt had an informal conversation with the board of directors of the Pan American Society today, reaffirming the United States' foreign relations, upholding faith and righteousness. Today is Pan American Day. After giving a formal speech, the President broke with precedent by not returning to his seat, closing all the broadcast microphones and making an informal supplementary speech. The President first briefly described the promises he made when he took office in 1933 and compared them with the government's actions to show that the United States upholds faith and righteousness, unlike other countries' empty words. For example, regarding Cuba, the United States has declared that it will no longer interfere and has upheld this promise to this day. It is said that the President's supplementary speech today was even more important than the prepared speech. Only the diplomats and hosts of various countries were present at the time.

<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the Pan American Union on Pan American Day, stating that the American continent has now entered a period of peace. In the past four years, North and South America have made many achievements in the economic field. He mentioned his trip to the capital of Argentina in December last year to participate in the Pan American Conference, saying that the American countries are united and committed to the development of democracy in the New World. This unity is very powerful and very helpful to the cause of world peace, which makes him extremely moved and unforgettable. However, in the world as a whole, extreme militarism is sweeping through, and freedom of speech and religion are being blocked everywhere. This is contrary to the democratic ideals based on the people's free choice of government. In this insecure international environment, it is impossible to make democracy increasingly prosperous.

<h3>Malayan Authorities Expel Workers</h3>
<p>Considered to Be Agitating for Labor Strikes</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons discussed the strike incidents in Selangor and Negeri Sembilan today. Labor Party Member of Parliament Parker questioned the authorities' authority to expel organizers of the strike, and Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore said that trade unions were originally illegal organizations in Malaya. Their expulsion this time was due to their organization of strike movements. However, those who had previously used industrial disputes to attempt to incite riots and disrupt public order were also included in the list of those expelled.

<h3>Discovery of Ancient Tomb in Egypt</h3>
<p>Cairo – Southwest of here, fourteen miles away, is the Egyptian village of Saqqara, known for its pyramids and ancient tombs, located very close to the Nile River. Recently, archaeologists have made astonishing discoveries there. In an ancient tomb, a burial chamber was suddenly found, with beautiful oil paintings on the walls, as well as sculptures of birds, animals, and hunting scenes. Inside was a sarcophagus and an ancient corpse. The corpse is the remains of a wealthy landlord's nephew named Demid, who lived around 4500 BC. This important discovery is the result of twenty years of searching. The excavator, named Haysan, recently found a hidden passage sixteen yards wide behind a false door in the tomb passage, leading to Demid's burial chamber. The tomb had been robbed once in ancient times, as Demid's remains had been moved to the ground. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 15th)</p>

<h3>Recent Diplomatic Atmosphere in North China</h3>
<p>Japanese Military and Naval Commerce Liaison Method – Hashimoto Kitsu to Convene Military Attache Conference</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: In recent days, the situation in North China seems outwardly stable. The reason for this is that the Japanese military's actions have been slightly more moderate than before, leading to this. For example, the Japanese military's street warfare exercises were very frequent last year, but since the beginning of spring this year, they have been less common. Furthermore, for the Japanese Emperor's birthday on April 29th, the Japanese military would usually hold various combat drills. Although preparations for the celebration have begun, it has only been stipulated that a parade will be held at 10:00 AM that morning at the Huitong Airfield in front of the Limingzhuang barracks in Tianjin, with over three thousand infantry, artillery, and cavalry participating. The National Defense Women's Association, the Young Volunteers, and veterans will also participate in the procession. In the evening, a lantern festival will be held within the Japanese Concession. Other than this, combat drills are not planned. Because the Japanese military's actions are more moderate, rumors have no basis to arise, and social order is more peaceful than in previous years. However, recently, a terrifying atmosphere has enveloped a certain military headquarters and the Eastern Hebei puppet organization. This is because a certain party places great importance on North China regarding our diplomatic issues. The central government considers resolving the Eastern Hebei and Chahar issues as prerequisites for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations. The Eastern Hebei traitors fear that if the puppet organization is abolished, they will have no support, so they spread all kinds of provocative rumors. Furthermore, a small number of traitors, in order to find a way out, also fabricate information and report it to a certain military headquarters, causing them to become suspicious. They attach extreme importance to any high-ranking officials from Hebei and Chahar traveling south to meet with key figures in the central government, believing that they must be carrying secret orders back from the central leaders, preparing actions unfavorable to their side. Rear Admiral Shimomura, commander of the 10th Destroyer Squadron of the Japanese Third Overseas Fleet, arrived in Tianjin from Shanghai on the flagship Tenryu on the 12th. The ship docked in Tanggu, and Shimomura, accompanied by his staff officer Oi, came to Tianjin to meet with Japanese military commander Tashiro and Naval Captain Kubota. This was likely due to the impulse of rumors, specifically coming to consult on methods of military and naval cooperation in so-called emergency situations.</p>
<p>Hashimoto, chief of staff of the Japanese garrison in North China, returned to Japan at the end of last month to attend the National Division Commanders' Conference convened in Tokyo on April 6th, and represented Tashiro in requesting new diplomatic policies for North China from the Japanese military. Having completed his work in Japan, he was scheduled to return to Tianjin on April 17th to report, and planned to convene a North China military attache conference on the 25th and 26th, to communicate the intentions of the central leadership he had requested and to discuss how to implement them. Currently, among the junior and young officers in the Japanese garrison in North China, those advocating a hard-line stance towards the North China authorities are regaining momentum. They are planning to use the alleged theft and cutting of military telephone lines along the Pingjin section of the Beining Railway as a pretext to seek trouble with the Hebei-Chahar authorities. After Hashimoto's return, a policy may be decided. As for the Japanese military's claim that the telephone lines were cut, this has happened several times. As for the true cause, although the authorities have made every effort to search for the perpetrators, they have never been able to capture them, and the inside story is difficult to grasp. The authorities believe that there is not only one telephone line for the Japanese military on the Pingjin section of the long-distance line. There are many provincial long-distance lines and Beining Railway lines, but there have been no reports of them being cut. Only the Japanese military headquarters' telephone line has been stolen, which is worth studying. Therefore, in addition to instructing Tianjin County Magistrate Chen Zhongyue to earnestly order the police and village chiefs of nearby railway villages to pay attention to protection, the search for the perpetrators is being intensified day by day in order to clarify their role and purpose.

<h3>Tianjin Cracks Down on Traitorous Labor Recruitment Agency</h3>
<p>Traitors Used by a Certain Party – Main Culprit Zhu Baosheng Arrested</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tianjin Municipal Police Bureau has received repeated secret reports that a certain party is employing traitors to recruit laborers to work outside the customs. In recent weeks, over a thousand people have been transported away. According to the reports, the Bureau instructed detectives to pay attention. On the evening of the 10th, they cracked down on a labor recruitment agency for a certain party in a small shop in Zhongguan Xiatou, and captured a traitor named Song Baosheng. He was taken to the Second District Police Sub-Bureau, and subsequently, three deceived farmers, Yue Yuchen, were also captured. After a brief interrogation by the Second Sub-Bureau, all the suspects, along with their confessions, were transferred to the Police Bureau. The Third Section is currently conducting a strict interrogation. According to investigations, the traitor Song Baosheng is 35 years old, from Xinhe County, Hebei Province. He has been recruiting laborers for a certain party to work outside the customs for some time, having transported several batches. His recruitment methods include intimidation and inducement, and his tricks and methods are numerous. Three farmers from Anle County, Hebei Province, Yue Yuchen (26 years old), Jia Huanzhang (29 years old), and Yu He (20+ years old), came to Tianjin from their hometowns to seek a living. Song Baosheng, in order to curry favor with a certain party, falsely claimed to find them work, designing for Yue and others to take photos to prepare for customs procedures, and extorting two yuan from each of them. However, his scheme was discovered by Yue and others, who secretly reported it to the authorities, leading to the crackdown. However, Song Baosheng still has accomplices, and the police bureau is instructing the relevant departments to hunt them down for arrest.</p>
<p>Five or six years ago, many workers from inland areas went outside the customs to seek a living. After the September 18th Incident, the Japanese and puppets implemented a blockade policy in the Northeast, and the Great East Company was established in Tianjin, Tangshan, and Shanhaiguan to handle the so-called "entry" procedures. They placed all sorts of obstacles and strict restrictions on workers leaving the customs, and after leaving the customs, their lives and safety were not guaranteed. Even if they were lucky enough to survive and find work, the Japanese and puppets treated them like cattle and horses, using all their means of abuse and cruelty. Recently, the puppets relaxed the so-called "entry" restrictions because they needed a large number of laborers to build defensive works against Russia along the border of Manchukuo. They dispatched traitors to secretly recruit workers in the inland areas around Tianjin and Hebei Province, and ordered the "Eastern Hebei" puppet organization to recruit conscripts on their behalf, and limited the "Eastern Hebei puppet organization to recruit at least 380,000 people within this year. Yin Rugeng, in order to curry favor with a certain party, was still afraid that there was no excuse to use. This time, the demand for conscripts outside the customs was obeyed with the utmost care, which is self-evident. The "Eastern Hebei Puppet Civil Affairs Department" is currently instructing various counties to register workers leaving the customs. The "Eastern Hebei" broadcasting station in Tong County broadcasts lectures promoting the benefits of leaving the customs every day, which can be heard in the Pingjin area. The wording is disgusting, and I mourn for my ignorant villagers who are being fooled and still do not realize it. It is also learned that the Japanese and puppets are recruiting laborers for three other purposes besides building defensive works against Russia along the border of Manchukuo: (1) to cultivate wasteland in the Kwantung Leased Territory and Xing'an Province, (2) to complete important military and transportation construction projects, and (3) to harvest forests and develop mines in Jilin and Heilongjiang.</p>
<p>Because the number of laborers leaving the customs is increasing day by day, third-class passengers between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan are extremely crowded. Every day, there are laborers gathered at Tianjin Tanggu Tangshan and other stations who cannot buy tickets to board the train. For this reason, the Beining Railway Bureau has added a Tianjin-Shanhaiguan passenger train specifically for carrying third-class passengers, departing east from Tianjin Central Station at 11:30 PM every night and arriving at Shanhaiguan at 6:45 AM the next morning. It only stops at major stations along the way such as Tanggu, Tangshan, Guye, Changli, Lu County, and Qinhuangdao, but it departs half an hour earlier than the two nighttime express trains, so that passengers going east are not as crowded as before. According to news from Tangshan, in the past half month, the number of workers leaving the customs from inland areas has reached 50,000, and the number of people on the way is not included. Although the Japanese and puppets have a high demand for laborers, the restrictions on identity verification are still strict, fearing that righteous soldiers or Northeastern patriots in exile in other provinces will sneak back to launch an uprising. Therefore, many are rejected from leaving the customs. Between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan, there are many poor workers who cannot leave the customs or return home, and are destitute. Most of them have run out of funds and are begging for a living in the Tangshan and Lu County areas, which is very pitiful. (13th)</p>
<h3>Overview of the Work of the Beijing Municipal Government in the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>And the Direction of Future Governance - Mayor Ma's Report</p>
<p>Regarding Land Administration: (A) Land Surveying: In the 34th year (1945), we continued to conduct ownership registration in the 7th and 8th districts, and also completed the cadastral survey of the 8th registration district. In addition, we regularly handle requisition surveys, temporary surveys, and other businesses. As of the end of March of the 26th year (1937), we have surveyed a total of 33,676 households, resurveyed 8,029 households, drawn 34,846 maps for review, 22,354 sectional maps, handled requisition surveys for 2,898 households, and temporary surveys for 5,319 households. We have also compiled over 300 cadastral maps and 8 cadastral registers. In the second half of the 25th year (1936), we began rural area surveying. Due to the large number of buildings in the areas outside Hanximen, Shuiximen, Zhonghuamen, Hepingmen, and Tongjimen, we had to continue to use manual surveying. Since we started basic surveying in October of the 25th year, we have completed 35 percent. For household surveying, we have completed all 4,009 households outside Hanximen and have already begun registration. As for the remaining rural area land, which is estimated to be over 500,000 mu, almost nine times larger than the urban area, we have decided to use aerial surveying to save time and money. (B) Land Registration: Our city began conducting the first land ownership registration by district in July of the 23rd year (1934), with approximately 36,000 households. We originally planned to complete registration by the end of the 25th year (1936), but as of the end of March of the 24th year (1935), we had received applications from 18,000 households, with only over 700 households approved for publication, and only over 70 households completed registration, which was progressing quite slowly. Having received orders to shorten the registration time, we expanded the Land Department of the Finance Bureau into the Land Bureau in July of the 24th year (1935), and advanced the deadline to complete the registration task in the 24th year. Starting on September 1st, we continued to conduct registration in the 7th and 8th districts and shortened the application period to two months. By the end of October, the application deadline for each district had passed, but a large number of those who had not applied were found in each district. If we were to impose penalties or dispose of their properties according to regulations, it would inevitably cause losses to the citizens. In order to show consideration for the people's difficulties and complete the registration, we changed the final deadline for applications in each district to the end of the 24th year and formulated provisional registration measures. This measure, on the one hand, promoted the completion of registration, and on the other hand, gave the citizens a final opportunity. The generally hesitant households gradually became more enthusiastic about registration. As of the end of February of the 26th year (1937), we had approved a total of 29,866 ownership registration cases, 8,867 other property rights registration cases, 66 permanent lease registration cases, and 938 transfer and change registration cases. With the urban cadastral system cleared up, we began to organize the rural cadastral system in the 25th year. In addition to the above-mentioned surveying matters, which were carried out simultaneously using manual and aerial surveying, we must tailor the registration procedures to local conditions in terms of registration, since rural cadastral systems differ slightly from urban cadastral systems. Therefore, we have formulated the Nanjing Rural Area Land Registration Regulations, dividing the area into five districts: Fuguo District, Shangxinhe District, Xiaolingwei District, Yanziji District, and Lingyuan District. Registration has already begun outside Hanximen in the Fuguo District, and registration in the remaining districts is planned to begin after the cadastral survey of each district is completed. (C) Land Tax: Our city's land registration was largely completed by the end of the 24th year (1935). Therefore, in the 25th year (1936), the Land Bureau formulated various land price tax rates, which were submitted for approval. The approved rates are: for the municipal improved land tax rate, for building land, a tax rate of 14 per thousand of the assessed value is levied annually; for agricultural land, a tax rate of 10 per thousand of the assessed value is levied annually; for the municipal unimproved land tax rate, a tax rate of 25 per thousand is levied annually; and for the wasteland tax rate, a tax rate of 40 per thousand is levied annually. For areas designated as political districts or other areas where construction is prohibited or restricted for other reasons, the tax rate is the lowest tax rate for municipal improved land, which is temporarily set at 10 per thousand. The estimation of land prices is handled by a special appraiser within the Land Administration Bureau. The estimation methods are all carried out in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the Land Law. On the one hand, we investigate the market prices of land transactions in recent years, and on the other hand, we send letters to the district offices to investigate the recent market values. At the same time, we also refer to the prices reported by the people themselves during ownership registration to calculate the total average. For places where there is no recent market value to investigate, we use comparative estimation and income reduction methods to obtain the land price. After the draft is drawn up, it is submitted to the municipal government's valuation committee for discussion. The committee has the directors of the various bureaus of the municipal government, representatives of the court, representatives of the chamber of commerce, representatives of the bankers' association, and several expert members. Furthermore, when discussing land prices in each district, the district chief of each district is also present to participate in the discussion. After the committee has reviewed and approved it, it becomes the assessed land price. The Land Administration Bureau draws a land price district map and announces it to the public for a period of one month. For land with special circumstances that need to be increased or decreased, the households are notified separately, and if there are any objections, they must be submitted within 20 days. If no objection is raised or an objection is raised and a reassessment or adjudication decision is made after the deadline, it becomes the official assessment. Currently, the land prices in all registration districts in the city have been estimated and the announcement period has expired. All land price registers were also compiled by the end of the 25th year (1936) and have been officially levied by the Finance Bureau. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Anti-Smoking Office Seizes Smuggled Opium on Japanese Ship</h3>
<p>Worth Over Ten Thousand Yuan, Transported from Jehol – The Hua Nan Company is in Charge of the Smuggling</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Xiamen Anti-Smoking Investigation Office's Police Station received a secret report on the night of the 12th that opium smugglers in the city were transporting a large quantity of opium from Jehol, which was being shipped to Xiamen on the Japanese ship Tangshan Maru via Shanghai. They had hired a boat and sent boatmen to the port to receive the shipment before the ship entered the port. Therefore, the Police Station urgently ordered more than eighty members of the secret investigation and surveillance teams to assemble at 6:00 AM on the 13th, and to cooperate with the Second Water Police Brigade and the Customs to investigate. At 6:00 AM, the Tangshan Maru slowly entered the port from outside the port. Over one hundred anti-smoking officers and police, water police detectives, and customs officers were already waiting at the port on electric boats, surrounding the ship as it entered the port. After the ship was anchored, the anti-smoking police officers closely patrolled around the ship, and the customs officers also boarded the ship to search. Finally, several thousand taels of opium were found hidden in four boxes of glass tubes carried by a passenger on the deck, worth over ten thousand yuan at market price. The people and goods were taken ashore and handed over to the anti-smoking office for handling. According to the arrested passenger, named Wang Dongsheng from Hubei, the opium was shipped from Dalian to Shanghai, and then secretly shipped to Xiamen. It has been found that people from a certain country recently organized the Hua Nan Trading Company in Xiamen. In addition to transporting products from the Northeast to Xiamen and dumping them in southern Fujian, they have other secret businesses, namely transporting opium from Jehol to Xiamen, and using their nationals who operate the opium business to sell it.

<h3>Wuxi – Road Repair Clash Injures People</h3>
<p>The Lixin Road near Wuqiao in this county, from the Xie Xin Woolen Mill to the entrance of the Lixin Mill, had a narrow road, which was inconvenient for pedestrians and vehicles. The Construction Bureau was approved by the Construction Department to widen it to six meters and rename it Lixie Road. Construction began only yesterday, but over a hundred women from nearby residents came out to stop it, resulting in a clash. As a result, worker Li Lanting, villager Wang Yunmei, and Wang Laotai were all injured. The County Police Bureau sent police to suppress the clash, which prevented a major disaster from occurring. The injured were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment, and negotiations are underway to find a solution.</p>

<p>The Model Sericulture District of this county has produced more silkworm eggs this year than last year, reaching over ten thousand sheets recently. However, this year's distribution of spring silkworm eggs may be short due to the late ordering time of Wujiang and other counties. The Suzhou Construction Department has ordered more from Japan to make up for the shortage. It is now scheduled to be distributed separately from the 18th of this month. The total number of silkworm eggs distributed in the Model District of this county is 162,453 sheets.</p>

They broke down the door and entered, seized the owner, forced him to confess where he had hidden his silver, and seriously injured his lower body. As a result, they stole a silver neck ring and two silver bracelets. On the same night, the home of Chen Guangfu, a resident of Jiubao, was also robbed. The owner was injured and lost about a thousand yuan. The relevant water police team has been reported to for investigation and arrest.</p>
<p>Salt Tax Plus Construction Special Fund</p>
<p>The Yangzhou Salt Tax Inspection Sub-Office was previously ordered by the Ministry to levy a special fund for construction projects separately from the salt tax in each district. If the salt is sold within the producing area, it will be levied in the producing area. If it is sold within the sales area, it will be levied in the sales area. The office found that all Huainan Waijiang Neihe, Jiangdu, Tianchang, Gaoyou, Baoying, Yizheng, Xinghua, Tai County, Dongtai, Taixing, Yangzhong, Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, Yancheng, Fu, Ning, Jiangning, Jiangpu, Luhe, Gaochun, Lishui, Jurong, and other 21 salt banks, and the Changyinyun River Special District, sell salt by the city dan.

<h3>Jiangyin – Raising Funds to Establish a Flour Mill</h3>
<p>This county is located on the bank of the Yangtze River and is a stronghold. There is very little investment from businessmen in industry, so there is no major progress in the prosperity of the market. Recently, Qian Menggang, Zhou Jimei, and Rong Ruixing from Xiren and others raised 400,000 yuan to establish a large-scale flour mill. The Xiyuan Yidui warehouse in the north outer river has been surveyed as the factory site. However, the house site belongs to the late tycoon Xue Liquan, and it has not been determined whether it will be rented out. Alternatively, a new factory house will be built in the south outer warehouse. It is expected to be realized within the year.</p>
<h3>Danyang – Murder in Zhangyan Town</h3>
<p>Wang Dagezi from Jiangbei, a cart pusher, currently lives in Zhangyan Town, Qidu District, this county. He married a Chen and they have one son and one daughter. On March 31st, the fish raised in the town's public pond was stolen. Xiao Suogeng, who runs a meat shop in the town, suspected that Wang Dagezi was responsible. The next day, he went to Wang's house to reason with him. The two did not agree and fought. At that time, Xiao punched Wang in the chest. Wang was injured and fell ill in bed. He died on the 10th of this month. His family prepared a coffin and buried him. The villagers were extremely angry and filed a complaint with the county government requesting the arrest of the murderer. After receiving the complaint, the county government sent personnel to the countryside to examine the body. It was found that the deceased had died from his injuries before his death. An order was issued to arrest the murderer for investigation.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing – National Goods Exhibition to Open</h3>

The exhibition location is the Children's Playground, and the exhibition period is scheduled to open on April 22nd and close on May 12th, which may be extended if necessary. The participating merchants and factories will be presented with certificates of merit by the Party and government agencies.</p>
<h3>Bengbu: Railway Porters' Strike</h3>
<p>The stationmaster of this station, Wang Beiqiang, dismissed all thirty-one head porters on the 12th due to rectifying the railway's reputation. He planned to replace them with porters of upright character. However, on the 14th, all the station's porters suddenly went on strike, demanding that the previous head porters return to work. Stationmaster Wang believed that Ning Qianli and Zheng De, both porters, incited the strike. He immediately sent a letter to the police chief of the Puli section, requesting railway police to arrest Ning and Zheng in Hexia. As they were preparing to escort them from the small platform to the station, the porters discovered the plan. Immediately, over a thousand people gathered, standing guard in Hexia and under the Yangqiao bridge, preventing the escort. The railway police, seeing the large number of people, feared an accident and reported to the 85th Division of the garrison. A platoon of soldiers was dispatched to the scene to suppress the situation and fired several shots into the air. The situation became very serious for a time, but the group of porters remained gathered and did not disperse. Fortunately, Battalion Commander Chen of the Third Battalion of the Central Army arrived and took Ning and Zheng to the battalion headquarters for detention, where they were released on bail pending further investigation. The disturbance was temporarily quelled.</p>

<p>Various people who went to pay respects at the funeral of Jiang Xihou, the elder brother of Chairman Chiang, are now returning to Shanghai one after another. Yu Qiaqing returned first on the Ningxing liner of the Sanbei Company yesterday morning. Xu Shiying, the Ambassador to Japan, arrived in Shanghai by train via Hangzhou at 10:30 PM last night. The remaining dignitaries from the central government and representatives from various local governments, except those retained by Chairman Chiang, boarded the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Xinjiangtian liner and the Ningshao Company's Xin Ningshao liner from Ningbo last night and are expected to arrive in Shanghai at 6:00 AM this morning.

Wu Zhihui, a member of the Central Supervisory Committee, who represented the central government in offering condolences to Jiang Xihou, was injured in the head when his car overturned in Ningbo the day before yesterday. He returned to Shanghai on the Ningxing liner of the Sanbei Company the night before last and arrived at the 16th Pier at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Immediately after disembarking, he was taken by his family to a certain hospital for treatment. Rumors that he went to Beijing by train yesterday morning are not accurate. Wu's friends in Shanghai are very concerned. As they do not know which hospital Wu is staying in, many are going to the China Association for International Cultural Cooperation on Xiafei Road to inquire, as Wu is the president of the association. Li Shizeng, Gao Lu, Yan Muguang, and others, all members of the Central Supervisory Committee, went to inquire yesterday. It is reported that Wu's injuries are minor and not very dangerous.</p>
<h3>Former Governor of Hong Kong Scheduled to Pass Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Sir Reginald Stubbs, the former Governor of Hong Kong, will leave Hong Kong on the Empress of Japan liner on the 18th of this month to return to his country. He must pass through Shanghai. Mayor Yu sent a telegram to welcome him to promote friendly relations between China and the United Kingdom and planned to host a banquet. Yesterday, he received a reply from the Baronet expressing his gratitude, but due to the hurried schedule and the fact that the time in Shanghai had already been promised to others, he was unable to accept the invitation and expressed his sincere apologies. Therefore, the municipal government will not hold a separate reception but will send a representative to the pier to welcome him at that time, it is said.</p>
<h3>Exhibits for the Paris Exposition to be Shipped by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The collection of exhibits for China's participation in the Paris International Exposition has been completed. Representatives from the Executive Yuan and other organizations and the examination committee of the association have been carefully examining them for days. Exhibits from Peiping, Guangdong, and other places will also be shipped to Shanghai for examination and display locations within days. The display location has been agreed upon by the Ambassador to France. All exhibits can be packed and shipped out within the month. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Response</p>
<p>Although the time for China's participation in the Paris Exposition this time is tight, the response from all parties has been enthusiastic. Therefore, the number of exhibits has reached more than 2,000. The government is providing assistance and is carefully selecting exhibits to fully demonstrate the progress of China's industrial arts and technology in recent years. The association will compile explanations for each exhibit and then submit them for examination. The government representatives, Liang Ziqing from the Executive Yuan, Yuan Zijian from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tang Xifen from the Ministry of Education, and Ma Keqiang from the Ministry of Industry, came to Shanghai again the day before yesterday for another week of review. They also instructed that the French translation of the name of the exposition and the list of attendees be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. During the examination, they reiterated the government's intention to pay special attention to quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Continued Examination Yesterday</p>
<p>The association followed the instructions of the representatives and held another examination yesterday (the 15th). Committee members Cai Wuji, Zhao Jinqing, Huang Hanqiang, Lu Xingzhuang, Zhou Bangjun, Lu Fengshu, Guo Xiuzhi, and others attended. The exhibits were placed in several rooms, and the staff of the association reviewed them one by one according to their numbers to determine which to accept. Most of the exhibits were local specialties and custom-made items, which were exceptionally exquisite and were all accepted. The remaining ordinary exhibits were eliminated. The lacquerware from Fujian and the porcelain from Jiangxi were the best among the exhibits, so all were accepted. The examination was completed in the evening. Today (the 16th), the catalog will be revised and sent to the representatives of the Political Council in Beijing for review before being packed. The exhibits collected by the Peiping branch will be shipped within days. The association also contacted the special product exhibitions of Guangdong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces to select a part of their finest products for submission, which has been approved and will also be shipped for review.</p>
<p>Shipping by the End of the Month</p>
<p>The location for the exhibition in France was designated by the French government at the request of Ambassador Gu Weijun to France. Ambassador Gu has already taken over and reported to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has also sent a letter to the association, it is said. A telegram from Ambassador Gu in Paris states that the location for the exhibition has been agreed upon with the French side. The location is still at the International Exhibition Hall, which has been approved by the exposition authorities. Please acknowledge receipt. It is heard that the chairman of the association's district, Chu Minyi, will not be able to go to France due to participation in the Beijing-Kou Tour Group. Xie Shoukang will go on his behalf, carrying the exhibits. He is scheduled to depart at the end of this month. However, as the exposition is scheduled to open on the 1st of next month, he will not be able to arrive in time. Therefore, he will telegram Liu Fucheng and Xie Dongfa, the representatives in France, to participate in the opening ceremony in advance. The association will also print a new "New China" volume in French and contact the Central Photography Studio to bring several reels of film showing the National Boy Scout Grand Review, various constructions, the Guangzhou Special, and other films for screening as publicity.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures</h3>

<h3>New Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council Takes Office and Holds First Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Resolution to Elect Fessenden as Chairman</p>
<p>The new directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council for this year, Fessenden, Quille, Kim, MacDonald, Massey, Brand, Boardman, Bokube, Yamamoto, Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Guo Shun, Xi Yushu, and fourteen others, took office at the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday afternoon. They held their first meeting in the council chamber. Those present were General Manager Fessenden and General Secretary Phillips. After the meeting began, Yu Qiaqing proposed and Quille seconded that Fessenden be elected as Chairman to succeed the former Arnold. Then, Jiang Yiping proposed and Yamamoto seconded that Boardman be elected as Vice Chairman to succeed Fessenden's previous position. This move was only a formality as it had already been negotiated outside the meeting. Therefore, the atmosphere in the meeting was extremely harmonious. As there were no motions for discussion, the meeting adjourned after only fifteen minutes. It is noted that Fessenden is an American citizen. This is only the third time in the history of the Shanghai Municipal Council that an American director has served as Chairman. Fessenden is 45 years old and a native of Missouri. He has a law degree from the University of Missouri and has been in Shanghai since 1921, totaling fifteen years. He has always advocated for amicable cooperation with China. He has also been a director of the Shanghai Municipal Council for five consecutive terms and has achieved outstanding results. He has held important positions in the United States, such as First Magistrate and Protective Commander in Honolulu. After coming to Shanghai, he practiced law and is the most renowned American lawyer. The Electricity Company, the Telephone Company, Mobil, Shenchang, Texaco, Asia Flag Bank, the Bank of China, and others have all hired him as their permanent consultant. His firm is located on the entire second floor of 149 Yuanmingyuan Road and employs two American lawyers, three Chinese lawyers, three American secretaries, and two translators. The scale is grand, and the affairs are busy, as can be seen. His transliterated name can be Franklin. However, in order to comply with Chinese customs, he has always used Fessenden. Arnold, the former Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, sent a letter to Fessenden, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating that during his three years as Chairman, the heads of the various departments and all the staff in the bureau were loyal to their duties and the results were very good. Please convey his thanks.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Air Defense Inspection Group Arrived in Shanghai the Night Before Last</h3>
<p>Inspected Yesterday, Departed for Suzhou Today</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Security Commander initiated and dispatched members of the Party and government organs of the province to form the Zhejiang Provincial Air Defense Inspection Group to conduct on-site inspections to understand the air defense construction situation in various places and use it as a reference for Zhejiang Province.

Today, they will leave Shanghai for Suzhou and then transfer to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other provinces and cities in the Yangtze River basin for inspection, it is said.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Revision to the Income Tax Collection Guidelines</h3>
<p>Remarks by Yan E'sheng, Secretary of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the detailed rules and collection guidelines for the income tax regulations, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has first encouraged various industries to implement them. At the same time, it has also invited representatives from local chambers of commerce and municipal guilds to hold research meetings. After the research meetings, a special committee was formed to discuss in detail and submit opinions item by item, requesting revisions. The Ministry of Finance has now revised and promulgated the draft collection guidelines for the first, second, and third categories. Many of the requests made by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have been adopted. This matter is of great importance to businessmen across the country. The following are the important points stated by Yan E'sheng, the secretary of the association, in his statement:</p>
<p>Calculation of Public Accumulation: Item 5 of the original draft collection guidelines for the first category limited the scope of the public accumulation fund, referring only to the public accumulation fund stipulated by laws and regulations. The business community requested the most significant modification of this restriction. Item 6 of the revised collection guidelines for the first category states that "all statutory public accumulations, voluntary public accumulations, retained earnings, etc., shall be included." Although Item 13 of the revised guidelines still limits the statutory public accumulation fund to one-half of the total capital, voluntary public accumulation can be regarded as statutory public accumulation. Then, the restriction in Item 13 is also irrelevant.</p>
<p>System of Receipts and Payments: Items 9 and 10 of the original first-category guidelines adopted an accrual accounting system for receipts and payments. However, due to factual and customary relations, the business community often found it difficult to implement. Now, the Income Tax Affairs Office has adopted the request of the Chamber of Commerce and stipulated in Item 12 of the revised guidelines that it can also calculate its net profit "according to the needs of its business or its original habits, based on the scope of actual receipts and payments." This provides considerable convenience to the business community.</p>
<p>Donation Expenses: Item 3 of Item 12 of the original first-category guidelines stipulated that "free donations" could not be used as expenses. The business community believes that donations for birthday celebrations, disaster relief, and assistance to Suiyuan, which are related to national defense and major political affairs, and charitable acts for famine relief, should be used as expenses to promote public welfare. Now, the Income Tax Affairs Office has changed the provision to "free gifts." Then, donations related to public welfare, charity, or business can be used as expenses.</p>
<p>Calculation of Depreciation: The original guidelines had fixed time limits for the valuation and depreciation of assets. Difficulties were often felt during implementation. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce requested that flexible clauses be added. Now, Supplementary regulations have been added to Item 10, Item 15, Item 16, Item 26 of the revised asset valuation methods, and Item 10 of the depreciation rate calculation table to suit the actual situation.</p>
<p>Food and Lodging Expenses: Ordinary shop clerks and employees are provided with food and lodging, and this food and lodging expense is paid by the shop. However, according to previous interpretations, only employees with a monthly salary of less than thirty yuan could enjoy this treatment. If it was over thirty yuan, the amount thrown had to be added to the salary for tax purposes, which was very difficult in practice. Therefore, the Chamber of Commerce requested that the food and lodging provided by the employer not be included in the salary and remuneration. Item 9 of the revised second-category guidelines has made the food and lodging expenses of a business employee a deductible expense for those engaged in various businesses, with the remainder being considered income. However, the food and lodging expenses are limited to those who live or eat in the business premises.</p>
<p>Calculation Standard: Large enterprises and factories in this city often deduct salaries and remuneration of employees on a daily or hourly basis. If the tax rate standard is calculated based on a monthly fixed amount and the actual amount of income is used to calculate the actual amount of tax payable according to the tax rate standard, it will be very troublesome. Item 13 of the revised second-category guidelines is newly added. The provision is: "Those who are paid on a daily basis, those who are paid on an hourly basis, or those who are paid on a piecework basis shall calculate the tax based on the actual amount of income earned in that month." In addition, there are many revised points. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce is currently rushing to print the full text, and will revise the previously issued "Simple Explanation of Income Tax" item by item so that the business community can use it as a basis, it is said.</p>

Su Taiyu was publicly elected as chairman. After performing the rituals, the chairman gave an opening speech, stating briefly, "Fellow colleagues, today our association is holding its twentieth annual meeting. Colleagues across the country are extremely happy. Our industry has long been through hardships. By the autumn of last year, the rural economy had recovered, the cotton harvest was abundant, the sales of yarn and cloth were brisk, and the situation of the cotton mills slightly turned around. However, internal worries and external troubles have not completely disappeared. For example, recently there have been proposals to increase the consolidated tax and the large-scale expansion of foreign factories in Tianjin and Qingdao. The former will increase the burden on textile factories, and the latter's impact is even more self-evident. Therefore, our colleagues should seize the opportunity to strengthen our financial resources and improve our technology to fight for survival in the future. To survive, we must strive for cooperation and work together." After the speech, the budget for the previous year and the budget for this year were approved, and several proposals were discussed. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Person in Charge of the Chinese Writers Association Issues Solemn Statement Yesterday</h3>
<p>News about "The National Crisis Record" Published in Japanese Newspapers</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Japanese newspapers "Shanghai Nichinichi Shimbun" and "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" published in this city yesterday (the 15th) contained a news article about "The National Crisis Record" published by the Reading Life Society. The content involved the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association. A reporter specially interviewed Yao Sufeng and Zhou Hanmei, the executive directors of the association, to inquire about this matter. According to the person in charge's statement, "After investigation, the contents of the book 'The National Crisis Record' are a collection of Chinese characters from 'Reading Life' that have been banned by the government. It was published in April last year, while the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Writers Association was established in March this year. The author of the book, Tong Zhenhua, is also not a member of our association. The purpose of our association's organization is to study literature and art and connect emotions, and it has no other function. It has no relation to 'Reading Life' or 'The National Crisis Record'. It is absurd for Japanese newspapers to link them together. In addition to sending letters to the two newspapers for correction, we are deeply concerned about causing misunderstandings and issue a solemn statement."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Federation Telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang Requesting Abolition of Foreign Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens Federation telegraphed Foreign Minister Wang yesterday, (titles omitted): "Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, the national power has declined, and foreign disasters have frequently occurred. Many countries have forced the signing of unequal treaties and enjoyed consular jurisdiction in China. This not only destroys the integrity of our country's judicial power, but also allows unscrupulous foreigners to use consular jurisdiction as a shield, acting beyond bounds and disregarding the law, resulting in unfortunate incidents such as infringing on the lives and property of Chinese people and disrupting public tranquility occurring frequently, which is very distressing. Recently, national unification has been achieved, and the judicial system has been perfected. All countries have no more excuses. Therefore, in order to achieve freedom and equality for our country, we should resolutely declare the abolition. Moreover, Egypt's abolition of consular jurisdiction is about to be implemented. Is our country inferior to Egypt? Your Excellency is well-versed in law and renowned, admired by both China and foreign countries. We hope that based on the resolutions of the Third Plenary Session and in accordance with the urgent public opinion of the entire country, you will quickly declare the abolition of consular jurisdiction of all countries in China to maintain the unity of judicial power and restore the lost national rights. We are extremely eager. Shanghai First Special District Citizens Federation bows, deleted."</p>

<h3>Person in Charge of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Employees of the Haiheng Steamer to Receive Subsidies</p>
<p>Regarding the recent reports of the employees of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiheng steamer requesting a raise, inquiries were made to the company, and it was found that there were discrepancies with the facts. According to the person in charge of the company, the company opened a new route to Xiamen and the Philippines and assigned the Haiheng steamer to operate on it. When the steamer was preparing to sail to the Philippines in Shanghai, the company received a report from the captain of the steamer that the employees who accompanied the steamer to the Philippines would be working harder during the voyage, the cost of living abroad was higher, and the currency value in the Philippines was more expensive than the national currency. It seemed necessary to give the employees a temporary subsidy to make up for this. The company believed that the captain's statement was not without reason, and it was reasonable to give the employees a slight preferential treatment for serving abroad. Therefore, when the steamer left Shanghai, the captain was instructed to observe the situation during the trial voyage, prepare detailed opinions, and report for verification. General Manager Cai also instructed the captain to do so. After the steamer's first voyage to the Philippines, the captain called to report that the employees' living treatment did need to be raised and made a request on their behalf. Director Zeng of the company's business department also called and made the same report. The company examined the situation and found it to be true. Therefore, it forwarded a request to the Ministry of Communications a few days ago to instruct that a considerable amount of temporary subsidies be given to the employees during the Haiheng steamer's voyage on the Xiamen-Philippines route to encourage them. This is a written account of the facts, and all the rumors outside are inaccurate, it is said.</p>
<h3>Workers' Conditions at Xinghua Paper Mill Resolved Yesterday</h3>
<p>General Increase of 10% to be Implemented Immediately</p>

Yang Along and Fang Rusheng from the Fifth District Paper Industry Workers' Union, Zhou Dawang and Chen Qichang representing the factory, and Zhu Guilin, the mediation section staff member of the Third Section, attended. Jiang Baofu recorded. With the consent of both parties, a mediation record was signed, stipulating: (1) Wages (permanent workers) will be increased by 10% across the board (implemented from April 16); (2) Workers will be promoted by three days per month (those who work for 15 days will be promoted by 1.5 days, and those who work for one month will be promoted by 3 days); (3) Year-end bonus is 15 days' wages per worker; (4) Bonus: The amount will be determined at the factory's discretion if there is a surplus at the end of each year; (5) When there are vacancies for permanent workers in each department, temporary workers who have worked for a longer period will be appointed to fill them; (6) The factory will subsidize the union's welfare business expenses by 60 yuan per month.</p>
<h3>New Yu Yarn Factory Workers Resumed Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>And Paid Severance to Laid-off Workers</p>
<p>Following the resolution of the strike at the New Yu Yarn Factory's first factory on West Suzhou Road and second factory on Roberts Road through mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters, both factories resumed operations at 6:00 AM yesterday. All day shift workers complied with the order and returned to work. The Public Concession police temporarily increased the number of Chinese and foreign detectives stationed at the factory for protection. At 6:00 PM, all night shift workers also complied with the order and returned to work. The factory has already paid severance to the twenty laid-off workers, including Xu Peixing, yesterday, and each worker personally signed for the payment.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Disaster Relief Association Expanded Organization</h3>
<p>Held Sixth Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sichuan Disaster Relief Association held a meeting at the Sichuan Native Place Association office yesterday (15th) at 1:00 PM. Over thirty people attended, including Yang Cangbai, Mei Xinru, Tang De'an, Ren Wangnan, Hu Zhengzhi, Tang Jinbai, Yang Jifu, Tan Yigong, Zhang Shulin, Li Boshen, Li Qingfan, and Gui Rongfen. Tang De'an was elected as chairman, and Yang Zehuan served as secretary. Following the formal opening, the chairman reported the reasons for the meeting. Then, Ren Wangnan, the manager of Juxingcheng Bank who recently returned to Shanghai from Sichuan, reported that General Zhu Qinglan would soon return to Shanghai to fly to Sichuan. The Central Government's 1 million yuan in public bonds for Sichuan disaster relief had been received and could be converted into over 700,000 yuan in cash to be remitted to Sichuan for urgent relief. It was previously heard that the Sichuan Provincial Government had raised 13 million yuan for disaster relief. According to Liu Hangchen, the Director of Finance, the allocation of funds was as follows: (1) 6.5 million yuan would be used to reduce and exempt last year's land tax in counties severely affected by the disaster. (2) 4.8 million yuan would be used for eight months of work relief, constructing roads in northern and southern Sichuan, at a rate of 600,000 yuan per month, but work had not yet started. (3) 1 million yuan would be used for agricultural loans, with the hope that each affected household could borrow 20 yuan. (4) 2 million yuan would be used to purchase rice in other provinces to stabilize rice prices in Chongqing. The Provincial Department of Finance would raise 500,000 yuan for this fund, with the remainder borne by merchants. Given this situation, long-term solutions would not address immediate needs. He hoped the association would quickly find ways to provide relief. Subsequently, resolutions were passed on various important matters: (1) All donations raised this time would be remitted to Sichuan for disaster relief. All expenses of the association would be borne by members and would not be deducted from the donations. (2) The Ta Kung Pao newspaper and Juxingcheng Bank would be entrusted as collection agencies. Private individuals were not allowed to collect donations. (3) A telegram would be sent to the Sichuan Provincial Government urging it to quickly raise substantial funds, along with the funds allocated by the Central Government, to carry out urgent relief efforts. (4) Individuals responsible for various tasks were appointed: (A) Ren Wangnan was appointed as the director of the fundraising committee, with Zhang Shulin and Zheng Yushu as deputy directors. (B) Mei Xinru was appointed as the director of the publicity committee, with Yang Jifu and Xiao Yanbin as deputy directors. (C) Tang De'an, Fan Zhongqu, Li Qingfan, Zhang Shulin, Li Dongfu, and others were appointed as directors. (D) Tang Jinbai, Gu Jiliu, Yang Jifu, Lei Yuchun, Yang Zehuan, and others were appointed as directors. There were many other important matters.</p>
<p>Another report: Association President Dai Chuanxian telegraphed Sichuan Provincial Chairman Liu Xiang yesterday, saying: "Chairman Liu, I am writing to inform you that the Central Government's 1 million yuan in relief bonds has been received and can be exchanged for over 700,000 yuan in cash. I will deliver this amount to General Zhu Ziqiao in the coming days. He and Cao Zhongzhi, the Finance Ministry's supervisory commissioner, will take it to Sichuan for distribution and urgent relief. However, the disaster area is vast, covering over 120 counties. Distributing only this amount would mean less than 10,000 yuan per county, which is truly insufficient. Investigations show that the governments of Henan and Shaanxi provinces have allocated emergency relief funds at least equal to the amount allocated by the Central Government. The Sichuan disaster is particularly severe. I implore you to quickly find ways to allocate cash, at least reaching an average of 10,000 yuan per county, so that there is some assistance. When General Zhu arrives, he can join in the distribution. Your benevolent administration will be widely applied, and your care for your homeland will be unmatched. I trust you will gladly agree. Furthermore, it is heard that famine victims in the disaster area are extremely panicked, fleeing the area for food, and order is precarious. Now that various parties have developed relief measures, it seems appropriate to announce and encourage the famine victims to stay and await relief in their locations to maintain order and stabilize hearts. Also, General Zhu will fly to Sichuan soon. Could you send a telegram to welcome him to show your respect? I await your wise decision. Sincerely, Dai Chuanxian, President of the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association." End of message.</p>
<p>Regarding the Sichuan disaster relief effort, after the Ministry of Finance approved the allocation of 1 million yuan in Consolidated E Bonds, Zhu Ziqiao, Chairman of the Relief Affairs Committee, specially entrusted Ren Shishang, the manager of Juxingcheng Bank's Shanghai branch, to find ways to convert them into cash for disaster relief in Sichuan. It is now known that Chairman Zhu will return to Shanghai from Fenghua on the 15th. After further discussions with Manager Ren, he will travel to Sichuan with him. As there is an urgent need for cash, the bank has agreed to advance the funds. Cao Zhongzhi, the Finance Ministry's inspector for Sichuan disaster relief, came to Shanghai and met with Manager Ren to inquire about the situation in Sichuan and exchange relief measures. Cao also plans to travel to Sichuan with Chairman Zhu, Manager Ren, and others to conduct an on-site inspection of the disaster situation.</p>

<p>Ministry Orders City Government to Mediate Properly</p>

<h3>American Oriental Company Purchases Two New Ships from Britain</h3>
<p>Trade Improves; Plans to Increase Freight Rates</p>
<p>Based on observations from various sources, Shanghai's shipping industry is indeed gradually entering a period of prosperity. This is largely due to the overall improvement of various industries and rising prices. Ship rentals and freight rates have increased due to the high cost of steel and other materials. The existing ships are insufficient to meet demand, making it difficult for importers to transport goods from Europe and America. According to news, the American Oriental Company at No. 12 on the Bund has commissioned agents to purchase two merchant ships from Britain, each with a capacity of 9,500 tons, named "Kenilworth" and "Silkworth." According to shipping industry insiders, these two ships are expected to arrive off the coast of China soon. It is also heard that Chinese and foreign shipping companies operating in China's inland rivers and coastal areas are planning to increase freight rates due to the current improvement in business, in order to make up for losses incurred in recent years. Members of the public have not voiced much criticism of these plans, and have expressed considerable sympathy, recognizing the significant difficulties that the shipping industry has faced in the past. The cost of new ships is high, and the prices of rentals, steel, and other shipbuilding materials have all risen. For example, a small, ordinary ship that cost only 165,000 yuan last year now costs at least 250,000 yuan, demonstrating the soaring prices of ships. It is heard that the Yangtze River Shipping Association has repeatedly convened meetings of its members to discuss the current shipping situation and has reached a considerable agreement on increasing freight rates on coastal routes. It is also heard that goods stored in warehouses upstream have recently been shipped downstream fully loaded due to improved conditions upstream.</p>

<p>Report Items: Following the formal opening and Chairman's report, (1) Regarding assisting the Public Concession in opposing the Municipal Council's increase of the municipal general tax by 2%, the association sent a letter to the Municipal Council stating the facts that the tax should not be increased and sent letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Public Concession Ratepayers' Association, and First Special District Citizens' Federation, urging them to persist to the end and promising the association's full support. (2) The Public Works Department increased the monthly fee for the French Concession employment agency by six yuan. After several negotiations by the association and Director Zhang, the Public Works Department agreed that the six yuan for the spring season could not be reduced, but future proposals for reductions could be considered. Upon hearing this news, the employment agencies scrambled to gather the funds. Fifty-three agencies paid half of the amount (three yuan), while the remaining half (three yuan) is being collected. More than ten agencies have not agreed to Director Zhang Qun's mediation and have not paid anything. (3) April 12th was the tenth anniversary of the Shanghai Purification Movement.

Resolution: Send letters to the Public Works Department and the Water and Electricity Company. (3) The Chinese and Foreign Catering Association sent a letter stating that the French Concession authorities are preventing the establishment of an association. Should the association negotiate on their behalf? Resolution: Follow through. (4) Should the association unanimously advocate for the abolition of consular jurisdiction in the concession?

(2) Proposal by Committee Member Qin Liankui: Regarding the previous resolution of the association to request the Ministry of Judicial Administration to approve the application of minimum fees for lawyers' public expenses, since the five associations of Shanghai, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Hangzhou, Wuxian unanimously advocate joining other local lawyers' associations to jointly petition the Ministry, the matter should be handled after their petition is resolved. Resolution: Approved to postpone the matter. (3) Reply from the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council Police Department: Regarding the request to instruct the police stations that lawyers need only present their badges or accompany the parties' families to meet with detainees, and to establish a special room for lawyers to meet detainees, the matter has been ordered for review.

Resolution: Urge the Inheritance Tax Research Committee to submit their research opinions for forwarding. (7) Reply from the Shanghai Land Administration Bureau: Regarding the measurement and sealing of land, an agreement of ten articles was reached with the Shanghai Local Court in July 1934. The failure to notify the court of sealed land certificates is due to the need to order guarantees for verification or request the court to publish an announcement of cancellation, which inevitably causes delays. Resolution: Send a letter to the Land Administration Bureau requesting that they still order guarantees for verification and handle the sealing of land for those properties for which the number and location cannot be reported. The communication between the association and the Land Administration Bureau should be notified to all members. (8) Proposal by Committee Member Lu Dingkui: Jointly with various organizations to launch a movement to abolish consular jurisdiction.

(9) Proposal by Committee Member Xu Zuoliang: After the contractor engaged by the association died, work has been suspended for many days. This delay is affecting the completion of the clubhouse. A deadline should be set for the contractor to resume work, and if the deadline is missed, the association should engage another contractor to take over, with the original contractor responsible for any losses incurred. Resolution: Send a letter to the Enterprise Construction Factory and its guarantor, setting a deadline of one week to resume work. If the deadline is missed, the association will take appropriate action according to law. (10) Proposal by Committee Member Xu Zuoliang: The Shanghai Second Special District Local Court is causing considerable delays in the procedure for parties to receive funds.

<h3>Vehement Condemnation of the Pro-Japanese Puppet Inspection Group of Reporters from Beiping: Declaration by the Journalists Association of This City</h3>
<p>Direct Insult to the Dignity of Reporters, Indirect Insult to National Dignity; Must Declare Great Righteousness and Clarify Attitude to Maintain Glory</p>
<p>The Journalists Association of this city, regarding the organization of an inspection group of reporters from Beiping to Japan and the puppet regime, decided to issue a declaration to warn them. The original text of the declaration is as follows: "It is now April, and soon it will be May. May is the month when the Chinese nation endures humiliation. When our compatriots recall the past and trace the history of blood and tears of 'September 18th' and 'January 28th,' they are all indignant. Unexpectedly, at this time, some reporters from Beiping, such as Jin Dazhi and Li Chengyi, have organized an inspection group to Japan and the puppet regime and set out to the east. The pain of this matter is even greater than this. Since the establishment of the puppet organization, no one has dared to openly have any relationship with the puppet organization or go to the puppet regime outside the customs. Going to the puppet regime requires purchasing a national certificate first. Purchasing a national certificate is tantamount to recognizing the puppet state. The national certificate is a contract of enslavement. Ordinary people are unwilling to do this, let alone journalists who stand before the public and lead public opinion, especially those who are instructed by others and receive subsidies from others. The members of this association believe that the actions of this group directly insult the dignity of journalists, indirectly tarnish the national dignity of the Chinese nation, and are even sufficient to affect international perceptions. We must declare great righteousness and clarify our attitude, so that people know that the acceptance of utilization by a few reporters is not tolerated by the industry and that everyone can strive for self-respect and maintain their glory. This is the humble intention of the members of this association. This declaration is hereby made, and we hope for public judgment."</p>

It was found that Wang Shisheng had been sentenced to five years in prison by the French Concession court in the 20th year of the Republic of China for a counterfeit money case. They were sent to the First Special Court, and the police department filed a public prosecution against them for the crime of using counterfeit currency. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. After the police department lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, Wu Rongguang was interrogated. He admitted to trafficking twice, and Chen Erbao also admitted to two instances, entrusted by his sister-in-law Zhou to deliver on his behalf. Wang Shisheng flatly denied privately trafficking in counterfeit money. Hua Chunlin stated that his boss asked him to collect rent from Wu Rongguang and was arrested and did not know about the counterfeit money. Witnesses were also presented, including Xie Wangshi, a convicted counterfeit money criminal currently serving his sentence, who testified, "I didn't know about my concubine Xie Amao making counterfeit banknotes. Wang Shisheng had come to my house before and talked to my concubine Xie Amao." Han Yutian, who was involved in the same case as Xie Wangshi, testified that he did not know Wang Shisheng. According to Pan Huizhen, a landlady from No. 13, Lane 110, Chengdu Road, Wang Shisheng and Chen Erbao came to rent the house first, and then a woman surnamed Zhou came to live there for less than a month. She did not know about the counterfeit money. At this point in the interrogation, the court reviewed the police investigation file and, finding that the facts were clear, ordered the debate to begin. After the police department lawyer expressed his opinion, only Wang Shisheng hired lawyer Fan Gang to defend him. The court then announced the end of the debate and set the verdict to be announced on the 20th of this month. The defendants were still remanded in custody.</p>

Recently, starting in August of last year, Yang Qingchang met Tang Xiangying, a Viennese dancer, outside and rented a house with her at No. 43 Gaofuli, Notre Dame Road. On March 18th of this year, Yang Zhengfengying received an anonymous letter informing her of the residence of Yang Qingchang and Miss Tang. She reported it to the French Concession police, who arrested Yang Qingchang and Tang Xiangying and sent them to the First Special Court for prosecution according to law.</p>
<p>Result of the Judgment:</p>
<p>Yang and Tang were each sentenced to two months of imprisonment, which could be commuted to a fine of two yuan per day. However, after Yang regained his freedom, he still did not return home. Therefore, Yang Zhengfengying hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Special Court's Criminal Court, accusing Tang Xiangying of interfering with the family and requesting an order to publish an apology in the newspaper to restore her reputation. After receiving the complaint, the court, led by Criminal Court President Liao Ming, summoned the plaintiff, Yang Zhengfengying, who arrived with her lawyer, to the Second Criminal Court at 3:00 PM yesterday. The defendant, Tang Xiangying, claimed to be ill and sent a lawyer to appear on her behalf. After questioning the plaintiff about her age, place of origin, and address, the court ordered her to briefly describe the</p>
<p>Purpose of the Lawsuit:</p>
<p>Then, the court asked the plaintiff, "Is Yang Qingchang your husband? You previously reported to the police that your husband had committed adultery with Tang Xiangying, and this court has rendered a final judgment. Why do you want to sue her now?" The plaintiff replied, "Because my husband is being held by Tang Xiangying and not allowed to return home. Someone has seen Qingchang still riding in a car with Tang Xiangying, seen by Li Amao, who works as a servant in my house. Qingchang left home on January 4th of this year and has not returned. I also heard that Qingchang and Tang have rented another</p>
<p>Secret House."</p>
<p>"Tang deliberately enticed my husband to leave the family, so I want to sue her again," she said. The defendant's defense lawyer began by saying, "Yang Qingchang is not at Tang Xiangying's place. Yesterday, the plaintiff and Yang Qingchang were involved in a check dispute in the First Special District Court. Yang Qingchang appeared in court. After the court adjourned, the plaintiff wanted Yang Qingchang to go home, but Qingchang refused to go back, almost leading to an argument. The police persuaded them to leave." The court questioned the plaintiff, who said, "Yang Qingchang went to the First Special District Court yesterday. After the court adjourned, he was taken away by Tang Xiangying's father, who said he wanted Qingchang to give him</p>
<p>Two Thousand Dollars</p>
<p>To let him go home, otherwise he cannot go home." At this point, Li Amao was summoned to testify, "I work in the Yang family. The young master went out on January 4th. Starting on January 15th, the young mistress gave me two yuan every day and asked me to look for the young master in various dance halls. On January 18th, after the young mistress received a letter, she went to report the adultery to the police that night, and I went with her. At 3:00 or 4:00 PM on March 30th, I saw the young master and Tang Xiangying riding in a car on Notre Dame Road towards Fuxu Road." At this point, the official said to the plaintiff, "Your husband, Yang Qingchang, is also the son of a respectable family. He is promiscuous outside, and you go to report the adultery to the police,</p>
<p>That's Too Much."</p>
<p>Yang Zhengfengying replied, "He squandered money outside and wrote letters of repentance more than once. He also borrowed my money and returned a check to me for 13,000 yuan. He accused me of cashing in the money. Since he is heartless, I will be unrighteous and sue him." As a result, the court, because the defendant had not arrived, announced a postponement and ordered a retrial on the 22nd of this month. The defendant's defense lawyer was also ordered to ensure that the defendant would be present at the next hearing, as the defendant cannot be absent in a criminal case. If the defendant fails to appear again, an arrest warrant will be issued without leniency.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Dispute in Yongkang Lane</h3>
<p>Jin Xing Real Estate Company, the original owner of Yongkang Lane on Beijing Road, previously mortgaged the land of the lane to Tongqing Qianzhuang. Because it failed to redeem the mortgage when due, a lawsuit was filed. The court ruled that the rent of the lane should be collected by Tongqing Qianzhuang. However, the original owner mortgaged the house contract and the water company contract to a Japanese named Okamoto. Okamoto entrusted the Murakami Law Office to collect rent from the residents of the lane. Five residents refused to pay because it was illegal. The Japanese side then cut off the water supply to the lane, removed the signs of the World Geography Society and Dr. Xu Xiangren, etc., from the lane, and dug ditches in the lane to block traffic. At the same time, people were sent to urge the residents to pay rent. This dispute is also related to the issue of consular jurisdiction.</p>

He has a concubine, Wu Suzhen, 33 years old, from Xuzhou, who lives on the third floor of No. 90 Santai Lane, North Fujian Road. They have been lovers for a long time. Recently, Ma learned that Suzhen had a new acquaintance, a boat operator named Laoda Age. Because there was no evidence, he did not discuss it with Suzhen. At 1:00 PM yesterday, Ma went to Wu's residence and happened to find Laoda Age there. Shortly after Laoda Age left, he had an argument with Wu, which led to violence. Ma then grabbed a foreign knife from the table and stabbed Suzhen in the throat, causing her to fall to the ground and cry for help. Neighbors rushed up to stop him. Ma then stabbed himself in the throat three times with the foreign knife, also suffering serious injuries. Police officers who heard the news rushed to the scene and sent Wu to the Shanghai Sanitarium for treatment, but she died shortly after. Ma Agen was sent to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.

<h3>An Accomplice in the Yang Xiaodi Embezzlement Case Was Interrogated Once</h3>
<p>Jiang Daosheng and Xuan Jingen Both Testified That They Were Falsely Accused and Had Nothing to Do with the Case</p>
<p>Yang Xiaodi, an old clerk from the Second Fuxin Flour Mill on West Suzhou Road, had been working at the mill for more than ten years. On February 8th of this year, Yang was ordered to go to the head office on Jiangxi Road to collect 4,000 yuan in cash. However, Yang suddenly had evil intentions and conspired with accomplices to embezzle all the money. He then falsely reported a robbery to the Xin Zha police station. After the police station investigated the matter, they arrested Yang, sent him to the First Special Court for prosecution according to law. After the interrogation, Yang Xiaodi was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for jointly embezzling property held in the course of his duties, and his accomplices who were at large were arrested. The day before yesterday, Chinese detective Wang Qishan from the Xin Zha police station arrested two accomplices, Jiang Daosheng (alias Sanliuzi) from Jiangbei and Xuan Jingen from Jiangyin, in room No. 16 of the Zhongnan Hotel on Avenue Road and took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit according to Articles 30 and 336 of the Criminal Law. When questioned, Jiang Daosheng testified that he had been running a barbershop in Tanziwan, Zhabei. Yang Xiaodi came to his shop to get a haircut from time to time, so they became acquainted. Last year, Yang suddenly borrowed 30 yuan from him and repeatedly failed to repay it, so he resented Yang and was falsely accused. Xuan Jingen also claimed to have been falsely accused by Yang. According to Yang Xiaodi's complaint, he was deceived by Changjiao, who was at large at the time, and had nothing to do with Jiang and Xuan. Both defendants hired lawyer Ma Leming to represent them. Judge Huang ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the retrial for next Tuesday.</p>
<h3>Police Present Evidence in Case of Stepmother Abusing Child</h3>
<p>Wang Zhangshi's Evasive Words; Yu Kunwu Sent to Hospital for Examination</p>
<p>Wang Zhangshi, a woman from Wuxi at No. 5 Tongzhou Road, abused her husband Wang Linsheng's eleven-year-old son Yu Kun, born to his former wife, to an unbearable extent. A neighbor secretly reported this to the Jiaxing Road police station by letter. Chinese detective Chen Jinsheng was dispatched to the scene in the morning and brought Wang Zhangshi and the child to the police station. Yu Kun was sent to Tongren Hospital for examination. Wang Zhangshi was sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant was being prosecuted by the police according to Article 335 of the Criminal Law for the crime of embezzlement. The plaintiff, Huang Yushi, delivered 1,000 yuan to Lianfeng on January 31st of this year and entrusted him to perform a Buddhist service. Then, on February 12th, she delivered another 1,000 yuan. However, the defendant did not do as instructed and embezzled the money. The matter was discovered by her relative Su Hongsheng, who negotiated with the defendant. According to the defendant's own confession, more than 400 yuan were used for Huang Dai's Buddhist service, and the remaining money was willing to be returned. At that time, 1,000 yuan in cash and a deposit book with Zhang's name in the Shanghai Bank for a fixed deposit of 900 yuan (calculated as 560 yuan due to not being due) were paid in order to settle the matter. Now Zhang Renfu came forward and claimed that the deposit book was deposited with Lianfeng by him and could not be used by others. He then reported it to the police station, which arrested her and requested that she be punished according to the law. After Judge Cai briefly questioned Lianfeng, he ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing to be held later after summoning An Sicheng again.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Government Issues a Clear Citation to Gaoqiao for Donations to Road Construction</h3>
<p>Last spring, the Gaoqiao Rural Improvement Association launched a road construction campaign. Du Yuesheng first donated more than 1,700 yuan to build the Du Gao Road as a guide. Local gentry Ma Boshen, Wan Molin, and Zhang Rusong enthusiastically participated and donated generously. The enthusiasm for local construction was admired everywhere. By last winter, the roads had been completed one after another, including Du Lin Road, Lianjie Road West Official Road, Zhang Yang Road, Gao Nan Road, and Yang Xu Road. All of them were stone chip cinder roadbeds and were extremely solid, costing more than 13,000 yuan in total. Since then, transportation has been convenient, and the surrounding villages have praised it. In order to commend merit and express gratitude, the association submitted a report to the municipal government for commendation in December. It was learned that the mayor of the Public Works Bureau had approved the citation yesterday. Except for those whose cost was less than 500 yuan and did not meet the citation regulations, all Yin Yucun, Ma Boshen, Ye Baoxing, Chen Shaolian, Wan Molin, etc., were given a clear citation to encourage them. The certificates have been issued to the association.</p>
<h3>Lianfeng, a Monk from Jing'an Temple, is Accused of Embezzlement</h3>

<h3>Reasons for Conviction of Sun Shaoqing and Others for Making a Business of Soliciting Lawsuits and Extorting Money</h3>
<p>Unequal Distribution of Booty Leads to Public Prosecution, Court Punishes Legal Thugs to the Awe of Listeners</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing, a former detective from Nantong who had been dismissed, colluded with Jiang Zhaozhou to establish the Shuguang Law Firm. They specialized in making a business of soliciting lawsuits and extorting money, reaping considerable profits over the years. Recently, due to a dispute over the distribution of loot, Jiang filed a private prosecution. After the First Special District Local Court dispatched the police to investigate, Jiang fled in fear of punishment. His wife, Zhu, was detained. After thorough investigation and interrogation, Sun was convicted of continuous extortion and sentenced to five years of imprisonment, a fine of one thousand yuan, and deprivation of civil rights for ten years. Sun Zhu was convicted of perjury and sentenced to one year of imprisonment. He was acquitted of the charges of soliciting lawsuits for profit and extortion. It is said that although soliciting lawsuits has always been strictly prohibited by government authorities, under the old criminal law, there was no provision for this crime, so few were punished. Since the promulgation of the new criminal law, the authorities of the First Special Court, in view of the large number of</p>
<p>Legal Thugs in the City</p>
<p>These individuals often use the pretense of hiring lawyers and filing private prosecutions as the initial step in defrauding money. If the other party is not intimidated, they resort to various means of intimidation, such as sending threatening letters, making threatening phone calls, or engaging in various insulting behaviors towards the other party's lawyer, all to achieve the goal of extortion. In the past five or six years, Sun Shaoqing has earned no less than several tens of thousands of dollars through these tricks. It seems that there are still many people whose actions resemble those of Sun, but whose skills are inferior. The court authorities, hoping that these individuals would repent and restrain themselves, had repeatedly issued warnings and strict</p>
<p>Prohibitions, but their greed blinded them, causing them to willingly step into the net. The discovery of Sun's case this time originated from the private prosecution of his accomplice, Jiang Zhaozhou. The court, based on the allegations, determined that the circumstances fell within the scope of public prosecution. In addition to ruling the private prosecution inadmissible, it ordered the General Police Department to investigate according to law. Subsequently, under the supervision of Inspector Lu and detectives, it was discovered that Sun Shaoqing and Jiang Zhaozhou, who was at large, had, from the winter of the 20th year of the Republic of China to March of last year, extensively colluded with accomplices to</p>
<p>Solicit Lawsuits</p>
<p>As a regular business, using extortion to defraud ① Wu Dengying of 40,000 yuan, only giving Wu's sister, Sun, 12,500 yuan, and swallowing the rest. The said Wu was dissatisfied and sent a letter to the Lake Society Committee to complain. ② Zhou Xiangyun of 70,000 yuan, only giving Wu Yuee 5,000 yuan, and swallowing the rest with Tang Jiapeng. ③ Shi Dezhi of 40,000 yuan. ④ Lu Guanzeng of 67,000 yuan, only giving Lu Zhushuang 30,000 yuan, and pocketing the rest. ⑤ Xu Maochang of 20,000 yuan, only giving Pan Xueyan's mother, Pan Zhao, 3,000 yuan. ⑥ Jiang Yang of 47,000 yuan. The above</p>
<p>Six Defrauded Households</p>
<p>At that time, all were afraid of Sun's various acts of intimidation and had to sacrifice huge sums of money to settle the disputes. Now, the police have collected all the evidence and filed a public prosecution against Sun and his wife according to law. After interrogation and conviction by Criminal Court Judge Qian Hongye, the victims were all very pleased. The judgment extensively narrates the defendant's criminal activities in great detail,</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Words</p>
<p>First, it describes how Sun Shaoqing and Jiang Zhaozhou, one after another, in the names of Sun Wu, Wu Yuee, Shi Daoshi, Lu Zhushuang, Pan Xueyan, Jiang Guopei, etc., hired lawyers to file lawsuits for the division of inheritance and compensation for losses, and how they made threatening phone calls to coerce the defendants in each case to contribute money for settlement. All the proven facts indicate that Sun and others committed continuous criminal acts. Although they cunningly denied it, the testimony and physical evidence of each case proved that they were guilty of soliciting lawsuits, extortion, and fabricating testimony and committing perjury in court. Finally, the reasons for the sentencing were discussed, mainly stating that, considering the above six cases together, Sun Shaoqing colluded with others to make a business of soliciting lawsuits for the purpose of profiting, and continuously extorting money, which was evidence was conclusive and beyond doubt. Although some of the crimes occurred before July 1, 1935, when the new criminal law had not yet been promulgated, and the old criminal law did not have a provision for the crime of soliciting lawsuits for the purpose of profiting, these should not be punished. However, since the new criminal law was implemented, they have</p>
<p>Continuously Committed Several Cases</p>
<p>Making it a regular business, the establishment of their crime is not affected in any way. Moreover, the defendant's soliciting of other people's lawsuits has a causal relationship with extortion. Although the old criminal law did not have a crime of soliciting lawsuits, its punishment for extortion was consistent with the new criminal law. Therefore, the cases committed during the era of the old criminal law should be treated as simple extortion. However, since the behavior was continuous, and the continuous crime should be considered as one crime under the new law, it should be sentenced according to the new criminal law. After examining the crime of extortion, it is more serious than soliciting lawsuits, so it should be based on</p>
<p>Extortion</p>
<p>To declare the crime and sentence. As for the case of the police prosecuting the defendant for extorting Yao Yuebo in the name of his nephew Yao Zhichun in early January of the 20th year of the Republic of China, it is only sufficient to prove that the defendant was soliciting for profit. At that time, the new criminal law had not yet been promulgated, so there is no need to judge. Although the defendant Sun Zhu is Sun Shaoqing's wife, she did not know about Sun Shaoqing's soliciting lawsuits for profit and continuous extortion. However, there is no evidence to prove whether they jointly planned and put forward Sun Shaoqing as the person to implement it, except for the</p>
<p>Perjury Portion</p>
<p>Which fabricated facts, and the prosecuting attorney added the charge verbally on the trial date, should be punished according to law. Regarding the portion of soliciting lawsuits and continuous extortion, it should be</p>
<p>Acquitted. The perjury committed by the defendant was during the era of the old criminal law. The penalty under the new criminal law is lighter and should be punished according to the new criminal law. The defendant Sun Shaoqing has repeatedly committed crimes, and the damage caused by his crimes is as high as several hundreds of thousands, and the circumstances are</p>
<p>Exceptionally Serious</p>
<p>The sentencing should be severe. The circumstances of the defendant Sun Zhu are less serious and should be given a lower sentence within the statutory range. Based on the above conclusions, according to Articles 28, 56, and 346, Paragraph 1, Article 157, Paragraph 2, Article 55, Article 37, Paragraph 2, Article 42, Paragraphs 2 and 3, Article 2, Paragraph 1, first half, Article 168 of the Criminal Law, Article 290, first half, and Article 293, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is as stated in the main text.</p>
<h3>Principal Offender Du Wenkui, Who Killed His Wife, Apprehended</h3>
<p>Du Wenkui, a native of Huai'an, also known as Du Liu (34 years old), along with his elder brother Du Wenli (Du Wu) and younger brother Du Wenhua (Du Qi), each wielding sharp blades, stabbed his wife, Madam Li, more than twenty times at his residence in Moluli Lane, Jinling Road, Zhabei, late in the evening on January 19 of this year. After the incident, the police arrested the accomplices Du Wu and Du Qi and sent them to court for trial. The injured woman was transported to Renji Hospital. Fortunately, the injuries were not fatal, and her life was saved. It is now learned that the Criminal Investigation Brigade of the Municipal Police Department dispatched officers along with Li Songshan, the father of the plaintiff Madam Li, to capture the principal offender Du Wenkui on the Xiaguan Longjiang Bridge Road in the capital and escorted him back to Shanghai. According to his confession, he killed his wife because he learned that Madam Li had an adulterous affair with Zhou Qingfa, was infatuated with the affair, and intended to harm him, so he struck first. The brigade verified the confession and sent him to court for a joint trial.</p>
<h3>Robbery Report</h3>
<p>Li Shucan's Home</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, four robbers suddenly broke into the home of Li Shucan (58 years old), a carpenter from Guangdong, at No. 8 Shougeng Lane, Jiuda Lane, Gaochang Temple. Three of them were wearing blue cloth short coats, and one was wearing a striped cloth gown. They spoke with a local accent, carrying one handgun and one sharp blade, and forbade anyone to move. A handbag was taken, containing more than 30 pieces of clothing, more than ten legal tender, one real stone ring and one wristwatch, one western-style overcoat, and so on. After stealing the loot, the robbers fled without a trace.</p>
<p>Huang Wengui's Home</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, three robbers, two wearing blue cloth and one wearing a black short coat, suddenly broke into the home of Huang Wengui, a native of Shaoxing and former owner of a money exchange, at No. 14 Penglai Lane, Zhonghua Road. They inquired at the back door. The maid, unaware, opened the latch and let them in. The robbers brandished a handgun and confined everyone in the bedroom on the second floor, monitoring their movements. They then searched the premises, taking legal tender worth about 50 yuan, four gold rings, one jade bracelet, twenty-four pearls, and two gold bracelets, totaling about 400-500 yuan in losses. Afterwards, the victim filed a report with the Wenmiao Road Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Writes to County Government Requesting the Establishment of Public Cemetery Before Moving Graves</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Fellow Association wrote to the Yin County Government the day before yesterday, stating, "We are writing in response to your government's official letter stating that, based on repeated provincial cases, the Yin County Government is now considering public sentiment and extending the deadline to the end of April of this year for all floating coffins and exposed coffins within 100 meters along various roads in Yin County to be relocated by their owners. If they are not relocated by the deadline, the county relief agency will jointly relocate them to the Yishan Cemetery with the relevant township governments, and no further extensions will be granted. We were instructed to inform our fellow villagers abroad to relocate on time, and a list of township names along the roads was attached. This association has already issued a notice. However, the details of the relocation of the graves along the roads were not provided. Fellow villagers have inquired, believing that to relocate long-buried graves, there must first be a public cemetery as a place for them to be gathered. Those whose graves are being relocated will not have to worry about having nowhere to go. How many township governments have already built public cemeteries? What is the capacity of the existing public cemeteries? Before unified planning, it is difficult to achieve widespread relocation, and people will inevitably be forced to move the graves into the mountains. The number of graves in the mountains will suddenly increase, and the work of building graves will become busy. The cost of moving a grave is at least 100 yuan or more. If they still need to be relocated to a public cemetery in the future, they will inevitably fall into a double burden of labor and expenses. How can the people's strength bear this burden? The matter was submitted to the Ninth Member Congress of our association, which discussed and decided that, regarding long-buried graves, regardless of whether they are remnant graves or complete graves, if they must be relocated in the future, the government should first establish public cemeteries and wait until the public cemeteries are completed before determining the relocation methods." This letter is for your review and action.</p>

<h3>Fake Currency Exhibition Extended by One Week</h3>
<p>Since the opening of the Fake Banknote Exhibition on the 7th of this month, more than 50,000 people have visited. The exhibit that the association pays the most attention to is a one-yuan note from the Hubei Official Money Bureau during the Guangxu period of the late Qing Dynasty. This note was obtained by the association's founder, Yuan Dechang, with the consent of Liu Zhenhao, who collected it, to be used as one of the association's discarded currencies. It is said that Mr. Yuan has continued to collect discarded currencies, including a five-yuan note from the British Youli Bank that was altered to fifty yuan, which will be displayed in the counterfeit number category. The association was originally scheduled to close on the 13th, but due to requests from all walks of life to extend the exhibition, it was decided to extend it for one week from the 14th.</p>

<h3>Pipe</h3>
<p>— Fang Hei</p>
<p>An Englishman told me: Pipes also have life and death.</p>
<p>After a month, she is loving.</p>
<p>After two months, she is sweet.</p>
<p>After six months, she is seductive.</p>
<p>After twelve months, she is tired.</p>
<p>A pipe is just like a woman.</p>
<p>——From Ernst Toller's notebook</p>
<p>The hand, long stained yellow by tobacco, is now accustomed to the posture of holding a pipe. The newly bought pipe is made of clay, fat and clumsy, and it is tiring to hold it in the corner of the mouth. However, there is a profound meaning in tasting the spicy smoke and puffing out the white smoke rings. That is something that those who have not experienced it will not know.</p>
<p>I smoke strong cigarettes. Because of the heavy work, and also because of the vast time: when walking on the street, when busy, and when locking myself in a room and feeling lonely. My room was once filled with the bright laughter of friends, and we exchanged words about how cigarettes were not good for health. But in the end, I have lived with a cigarette.</p>
<p>I also wanted to throw away the cigarette butt between my fingers and never pick it up again, and sometimes I maintained this determination for half a day. But often a thought ran over like an old friend, and I was persuaded again, and a lit cigarette was quickly held in my lips, allowing nicotine to continue to numb my brain, continue to make my brain clear.</p>
<p>I had wasted too much effort, but all in vain.</p>
<p>So in the dark days, I was annoyed by the vast time. I accidentally saw a large pile of cigarette packs and the burned-out cigarette butts in the ashtray, and I couldn't help but smile to myself.</p>
<p>Life is always so ordinary, holding a cigarette to the mouth, smoking endlessly, puffing out endless smoke rings.</p>
<p>Now I have thrown away the cigarette butt between my fingers, but the hand, long stained yellow by tobacco, is accustomed to the posture of holding a pipe. Because I like delicate pipes, they have life and death. For the pipe smoker, it is just like a woman, from loving to sweet to seductive, and finally to weariness. Perhaps it will be abandoned in the corner of a drawer, covered with dust, decaying, or even eaten away by insects.</p>
<p>But now I am holding the newly bought pipe. The lid of the tobacco box is opened. I put the rough, cheap tobacco leaves in the pipe, and light it like holding a solemn ceremony, striking a match, and drawing a puff with trepidation. The smoke is bitter. It is too strong and too spicy for me.</p>
<p>I will become familiar with this spiciness and bitterness, I think. Because at first the pipe is loving. A woman who appears for a moment may be desirable, but becoming familiar with this woman may lead to weariness for no reason, after twelve months, or even shorter.</p>
<p>Life is not lived by holding light, pure cigarettes, but by tasting spicy and bitter smoke and puffing out white smoke rings. Let people temper themselves, torment themselves, and destroy themselves in bitterness.</p>
<p>For the time being, I am holding the pipe and feeling content, when I am busy, when I am walking on the street, when I lock myself in a dark room. When the day comes when I am tired of holding the pipe, I will pick up the cigarette butt that I have long thrown away.</p>
<p>The pipe, like a woman, will make me familiar with spiciness and bitterness.</p>
<p>I think so.</p>
<h3>Borderland</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>My friend Shu sent me a postcard after visiting the Badaling Great Wall. The front of the card is a small image of Badaling, and the back has a few words written by Shu: "Ming: I'm sending you this postcard. See, haven't the clouds and winds beyond the Great Wall changed color?"</p>
<p>I gazed at Badaling in the picture, the undulating and winding Great Wall. I am very familiar with this scenery. During the Spring Festival three years ago, I also stood on the Great Wall, and with a feeling of infinite emotion, I paid tribute to that great architecture, watching the north wind touch the crumbling embrasures with yellow sand.</p>
<p>I seemed to see the scenery beyond the Great Wall in those days. Hordes of barbarians riding strong horses chased each other in the sand and wind, speaking the foreign languages, blowing the Sheng music that was sad and heartbreaking. They would also look up at this insurmountable giant city with their companions, pointing to the beacon fires soaring into the sky in the distance and nearby with their whips, making their vows to annex the beautiful Central Plains, and at night, they would dream of emperors and heroes, resting their heads on the saddles, amid the whistling wind and neighing horses. …</p>
<p>However, there are no traces of the barbarians beyond the Great Wall. The blockhouses, fortresses, embrasures, and arrow slits have all collapsed. The watchtowers that once stood tall have also turned into piles of mud. Only the wind and sand are still rushing beyond the Great Wall like the barbarian cavalry and songs of the past. But the clouds and winds have changed color, the clouds and winds have changed color!</p>
<p>Now, when the descendants of the Yellow Emperor ascend to this peerless architecture, they have lost their pride. They lower their heads and weep sadly because of the change of the clouds and winds. They can no longer see the warriors who defended the city and drove away the barbarians, nor can they see the beacon fires. They cannot hear the clanging of weapons colliding, nor can they hear the angry roars of fierce battles. Only the hunting wind of the sky is rolling up the yellow earth beyond the Great Wall, rushing through this high city, spreading throughout the Central Plains, spreading throughout the Central Plains that was once called the Celestial Kingdom…</p>
<p>The clouds and winds beyond the Great Wall have changed color!</p>
<p>Look, the Great Wall is also sighing for its past glory. The golden age has passed, and now is a time of suffering, like a senile old man, seeing enemy cavalry attacking, but unable to struggle and counterattack, can only watch the enemy cavalry cross over. He recalls the ancient warriors who held guns and halberds, who still fought bloodily even in the face of barbarians all over the mountains and plains. Therefore, you hear his low sigh:</p>
<p>"Have the descendants of the Yellow Emperor died? In such a large Central Plains, is there not a single warrior who holds a weapon to defend the country? And the barbarians have come again!"</p>
<p>Gray sand falls from his body, and the fortresses and embrasures are shedding their fragments in the wind. This is his low sigh.</p>
<p>However, I know that the descendants of the Yellow Emperor will never let down this old defending soil of our nation, this senile Great Wall. One day, countless beacon fires will be lit beyond the Great Wall, and the descendants of the Yellow Emperor will resolutely hold on to their weapons, pressing forward wave upon wave, and die in the borderland for the sake of the glory of the past. Now, the change of the clouds and winds is a sign that the storm is coming. A new, independent, and free China is not far away.</p>
