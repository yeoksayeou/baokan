<p>時評</p>
<h3>小恊約國政治的動向</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>從上月下旬意大利外長齊亞諾訪問南斯拉夫。成立二國經濟恊定以後。各國報紙多認小恊約國的團結已漸解體了。可是意南恊定成立後不久。小恊約國常設政治會議卽於本月初在南國京城開會。歷時二日之久。會議結果頗為圓滿。同時捷克總統貝奈斯又於五日聘問南都。受南斯拉夫政府𤍠烈的歡迎。從這些事實觀察。好像小恊約國的團結仍然非常堅固。並沒有鬆散的情勢。這種現象在我們遠處東方的人看起來。簡直像一個萬花筒。摸不着頭腦。倒底東南歐的情勢是怎樣發展。小恊約國的政治動向又是如何呢。</p>
<p>對於這個問題的回答。我們祇可以說一句籠統的話。卽小恊約國現正徘徊於十字路口上。這就是說。一方面有離心的勢力要把小恊約國拆散開去。同時另一方面也有向心的勢力要把它加緊團結起來。而最近的複雜形勢。正是這種離心力與向心力互相門爭所產生的。</p>
<p>小恊約國在一九二四年成立的時候。其目的本在保衛國土。相互扶助並。為法國的外圍組織。以對抗德匈等國。這種形勢一直維持到去年。才始發生變化。變化的原因一方面是由於法國外交政策的軟弱。對德意採取妥恊讓步的政策。以致小恊約國的內部發生動搖。另一方面則是因為德意對小恊約國採取分化的政策。在政治上與經濟上予以相當的籠絡。使其不再對德意存着恐懼的心理。這種政策的施行。終於得到極佳的結果。尤其是羅馬尼亞與南斯拉夫兩國的離心傾向非常濃厚。例如羅馬尼亞於去年改組內閣。把親法的外長蒂多萊斯哥排擠出去。而代以親德的內閣。南斯拉夫則於今年一月同親意的保加利亞訂立恊定。最近又與意國恊訂經濟恊定。同時又投入沙赫脫所設的經濟圈套。依照最近的形勢觀察。小恊約國的離心傾向是非常顯明的。</p>
<p>不過我們也不能因為這種種的情形而就斷定小恊約國的存在已經發生極嚴重的危機了。南斯拉夫與羅馬尼亞兩國。雖因他們本身的利害關係以及德意的極力拉攏。而有離開小恊約國的濃厚傾向。可是最初成立小恊約國的目的。到現在還沒有完全失去。尤其是捷克的堅决擁護集體安全制度與忠於小恊約國的最初外交政策。使羅南二國不至於急劇的投到德意等國的懷中去。同時德意對南歐的侵略野心並沒有因為他們戴上和平的假面具而卽被人忘懷。試看意南恊定簽訂後。南國卽有反意羣衆大示威的舉行。而塞爾維亞族各反對黨領袖也聯名發表反對斯多瓦的諾維區內閣所行的外交政策。同時在羅馬尼亞方面。卡羅爾王已因德意等國大使公然參加被解散的鐵衛團團員的出殯禮。而擬改變其親德的外交政策。從這種種情形看來。小恊約國的向心力還是很大。一時當不至有瓦解的危險</p>
<p>總之。現在小恊約國的團結確已不如以前的堅固。但其前途的發展如何。還要看德意與法蘇二集團在東南歐的外交戰結果如何而定。</p>
<h3>日本財政問題繫於調整中日關係</h3>
<p>結城希望華北經濟提携　兒玉返東京將提意見書</p>
<p>京都　大藏大臣結城豐太郎五日由東京抵京都、發表如次時局談話。衆議院之代議士、豫料在總選舉後、亦似無大變更、政府解散議會目的、使政黨各人反省嚴重時局、故若無反省態度、則政府亦以堂堂政第、實行斷然手段對付政黨、政府現無積極組織新黨之意、然總選舉後如有新人以正當認識、樹立新黨、則政府亦不惜實行內面的援助、本人意見、考慮財政與經濟問題、結果不能不達到中日關係之調整、為根本問題之結論、吾人最希望以中日兩國民之眞正諒解、促進華北經濟提携、軍部方面亦有同樣意見、在此意味下、兒玉等經濟考察團之赴華、實有意義（六日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］日大藏大臣結城豐太郎、昨晚抵京都發表談話謂、對華關係不予以考慮、日本以後之經濟政策、極難實行、苟欲使中日經濟關係較為密切、中日間之全般關係、應加以調整、惟此項工作、僅能漸次進行、此層軍部現亦如此感覺、但仍以為華北問題之解决、除經濟提携外、別無他法也、結城對於許多日本方面認兒玉謙次赴華、考察結果失敗之意見、表示不贊同、關於外傳孔祥熙參加英皇喬治六世加冕典禮後、將取道美國返國、而途經日本時將稍作勾留一說、結城表示由於兩國間負責政治家之時相接觸、彼此意見大可調和云、（中央社六日電）</p>
<p>［東京］兒玉謙次返東京後、卽與東京財政與實業兩界各領袖交換關於調整中日關係提案之意見、極為忙碌、因此今日尚未晋謁外相佐藤、但决於二三日內向外相報吿、並提出具體之提案、兒玉為排除此間對赴華經濟考察團結果之過份悲觀空氣起見、對記者發表談話、詳述各種實際之成就、包括設立貨幣與實業特別委員會之决議、但承認對華北事件、因其性質嚴重、雖與中國代表經兩日坦白之談話、仍未獲得結論、兒玉繼提醒日本人士、對下列兩點加以注意、㊀由於經濟之堅定進步、尤其是在貨幣與工業方面、中國實際上已完成一個統一獨立之國家、因此據兒玉之意見、日本需要嚴峻糾正其以往對華所採取之路綫、㊁關於中國抵制日貨之問題、兒玉以為决不致發生、並指出上海若干大公司、幾已充斥日貨云、（六日中央社電）</p>

<p>［紐約］威爾遜學院、頃因國務總理赫爾、對於經濟上之和平、多所盡力、乃贈以紀念章、赫爾於接受之餘、並發表演說云、一九二九年世界經濟恐慌最大原因、端由各國未能在經濟關係上推行健全的建設的政策所致、抑知各國五經濟戰爭之後、苟非樹立和平局勢、則眞正的經濟復興、卽無實現之望、美國政府深明此義、乃於最近三年來、推行一種新政策、其他各國類皆加以歡迎、其中十六國目與美國簽訂互惠商約、國際時局因而發現曙光、所惜者與此相反之趨勢、仍無以防止之耳、某某國經濟、原甚貧乏、乃竟以薄弱之財源、消耗於空前的軍備競爭、則世界經濟狀况、無由予以改善、又安足怪異、今欲失之東隅者、能收之桑楡、亦惟由準備戰爭各國與努力構造和平各國、通力合作、俾以友好的邦交與合作為基礎、而將國際政治經濟關係、重行加以整理而已云（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［紐約］前總統威爾遜紀念基金委員團主席阿穆斯特朗、致詞、謂以孤注一擲為主義之國家、不容許貿易循其天然途徑而行、因彼等之目的、不在求商業之繁榮、但在覓取國家權力也、英國則並不若是、當可接受如赫爾已與他國談判者之條約、而同時亦無須將其現行帝國會議之制度、加以甚多變更也、（中央社五日路透電）</p>
<h3>國際糖會</h3>
<p>英政府款待　各代表演說</p>
<p>［倫敦］英政府昨晚設宴招待世界糖業會議各國代表、中國大使郭泰祺亦在座、此外復有日本及荷蘭等國大使、英樞密大臣麥唐納卽席致詞、主張為生產者求公道、麥氏並對於美國特使台維斯致力世界和平、極為頌揚、對於荷蘭總理柯里恩亦極稱頌、據麥氏所稱、世界糖業會議已得極良好之開始、此後加以國際間之好感、及坦白之討論、必可排除一切困難云、台維斯則謂、世界各國現已明瞭、對於糖業問題、卽有所讓步、亦不至有所犧牲、蓋恊定倘可成立、非但各國之經濟狀况、將有進展、卽世界之和平繁榮、亦將利賴之云、（中央社六日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］國際糖業會議美國首席代表台維斯今日向籌備委員會稱、美國已準備締結國際恊定、以使食糖貿易重入正軌、惟美國代表團之立塲、尚須經過國會核准、台氏並稱、美國亦希望他國均能提出相當之貢獻、如此、則美國已準備限制在國外市塲之銷售數額、並能保證他國仍得在美國市塲至少銷售現有之數額、據悉古巴代表將表示一九三一年之夏德本恊定、未能提高糖價、以致古巴雖限制產量、仍成無謂之犧牲、故古巴或將要求另訂新約、請以前未曾參加夏德本協定之國家亦限制出產、若干專家以為倘世界產糖國家、皆能遵守夏德本恊定之條件、其效力當可大為增加、惟有人亦以為糖業中人、如能效法以前之牛乳業及水菓業、廣為宣傳、以增加消費、亦可達到理想中之目的、台維斯氏則謂世界糖市之衰落、實因各國政府津貼過多之故、台氏估計去年各國直接間接之津貼、竟達美金十萬萬元、以致納稅人及消費者皆担負過鉅、美國之食糖進口限額規定、今年卽將滿期、彼希望此種政策、能永久施行、俾可有助於對美輸出食糖諸國之經濟狀况云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］世界糖業會議所討論之最要問題之一、卽為英帝國之產量會議已於今日開幕、由英樞密大臣麥唐納主席、査此次會議、卽一九三三年世界經濟金融會議所生之後果、現開會後第一項任務、卽先須組織一專家小組委員會、審核各國代表團所供給之統計資料、此項小组委員會已經成立、其專家委員、計有美國之胡德森、印度之米克·及荷蘭之諾福特等、再則、英帝國產量恐將成為此後辯論之焦點、各自治領域及殖民地對於前數次會議中所已獲得之利益、已有决定保持之意、且英帝國對於家種甜蘿蔔一業、已有四千萬鎊之投資、故亦無放棄之意、在他一方面、如古巴·荷蘭·捷克等生產國、則極希望英帝國能限制其產量、以期種糖者能享受歐戰時期中之鉅利、彼時糖價每噸高至英金一百四十鎊、而目前則僅六鎊半、</p>
<p>今日世界糖業會議開幕後、發表演說者有美代表台維斯·波蘭代表勒秦斯基大使、英代表殖民大臣奧姆斯貝戈爾·古巴代表孟那·澳洲代表卡賽·菲律賓代表波恩卡明諾·及秘魯代表巴爾度等、據今日正式布吿、各代表之來、其任務為陳述各該國糖產之特殊情形、並報吿各該國政府所採用之政策、以觀是否能遵照若干合理犧牲之辦法、成立共同恊定、增求大衆之利益、麥唐納開幕詞稱此次會議最重要之任務、卽對於世界之糖業、給以若干穩定及安全之擔保、麥氏復稱、會議之目的、固以生產者利益之保障為前提、但亦不可將銷費者之利益置諸腦後、英帝國本身、亦屬極大之銷費者、故亦决不願見糖價抬高至合理經濟平衡之上、吾人所以須求糖業之安定者、亦卽所以維持生產與消費之平衡、吾人復須記懷者、卽在若干國糖之銷費、因零售之價過高、已在竭力遏制之中、”麥氏主張此次會議應設法訂立國防恊定、以維持世界市塲上供求間相當之平衡云、</p>
<p>此次會議參加者共二十二國、惟意大利不參加、頗為外界所注意、各國中、若干國內之生產、係由政府加以經濟上之補助者、且自歐戰之後、生產量現已大增、價格因以銳减、因此各出口國之經濟遂受極大之影響、而英國所關心者、一則為本國國內之生產量、該項生產已成本國農政之鉅大項目、一則為殖民地之蔗糖生產、並據殖民大臣奧姆斯貝戈爾在糖業會議未開幕前所言、各殖民地之利益、將為英政府考慮之前提云（中央社六日路透電）</p>

<h3>Sha Wang and Others Arrive in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Staying in Nanjing for About Two Weeks and Waiting to Pay Respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Here to Report on Association Affairs and Request Instructions on Administrative Policies</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Sha Wang, Chairman of the Suiyuan-Border Mongolian Political Council, along with E Wang, Kang Wang, and a party of over thirty people, arrived in Nanjing at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Representatives from central and Mongolian-Tibetan affairs agencies and other organizations, numbering over two hundred, arrived at the station to welcome them. The atmosphere was warm and lively. Although Sha Wang is over sixty years old, his spirits were very high. After entering the city and resting briefly at the Overseas Chinese Guest House, he went to visit Wu Zhongxin. Wu returned the visit shortly thereafter and hosted a welcoming banquet that evening. A formal banquet is scheduled to be held at noon on the 9th, at which officials from Nanjing will be invited to accompany them. When a reporter visited, he issued the following statement: "I have come to Nanjing this time to pay respects to the central authorities, report on the affairs of the Council, and request instructions on future administrative policies. I will be staying in Nanjing for about two weeks. If President Chiang does not return to Nanjing for the time being, I may go to Zhejiang to pay respects and offer my greetings. After that, I will return north. The situation in the Suiyuan-Mongolian area is currently peaceful. The following matters relating to the administration of the leagues and banners urgently need to be promoted: ㊀ Security matters: We are currently continuing to investigate household registrations and organize Baojia, so that the people of each league and banner will be organized and trained to defend themselves. ㊁ Industrial matters: The most important thing is to develop highways to facilitate transportation. We plan to build a number of trunk and branch lines in the Iy and U leagues first, and funding is being raised. Since the recovery of Bailingmiao, the postal and telecommunications services have been reorganized, and telephones will be added to create a telephone network to facilitate the transmission of news. Next, we are actively promoting matters such as improving livestock, promoting afforestation, reclaiming cultivation, and utilizing water conservancy. ㊂ In education, we plan to set up schools to train teachers first, and then dispatch specialized personnel to implement it in various villages. We will also widely establish libraries, reading rooms, and sports fields to increase people's knowledge in order to promote autonomy. ㊃ Hygiene matters: In recent years, the Mongolian population has been declining. After examining the reasons, it is mostly due to a lack of attention to hygiene. Fortunately, the central government has already established the Suiyuan-Mongolian Health Institute and the Suiyuan-Mongolian Epidemic Prevention Office in Suiyuan. In addition to seeking cooperation with the Institute and Office to promote it, we really plan to broadly disseminate hygienic knowledge to the Mongolian people in order to restore the inherent health of the Mongolian people." (Central News Agency dispatch, April 6)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Sha Ke Du Er Zha Bu, Chairman of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Political Council, and Committee Members E Qi Er Hu Ya Ke Tu, Kang Da Duo Er Ji, Director of the Industry Department, and a party of over thirty people, arrived in Nanjing from Beiping at 3:30 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. They are scheduled to first visit Wu Zhongxin of the Mongolian Affairs Commission on the 7th, and then visit the heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, and pay respects to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Mausoleum. They are scheduled to stay in Nanjing for two weeks before returning north. Whether to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will be decided after asking for instructions. When Sha Wang and others return north, they also plan to visit Director Yan in Taiyuan to report on the Council's affairs over the past year. (Special dispatch, April 6)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Sha Wang, Chairman of the Suiyuan-Border Mongolian Council, accompanied by Kang Wang, E Wang, and Living Buddha Ge La Seng, and over fifty followers, took the Jinpu train through Xuzhou to Nanjing at 7:00 AM on the 6th. Kang Zuoqun from the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission and two section chiefs from the Suiyuan-Mongolian Office in Nanjing arrived in Xuzhou on the evening of the 5th to welcome them. Sha Wang told reporters that he had come to Nanjing this time to report to the central government on the affairs of the Suiyuan-Mongolian Council since its establishment a year ago and to request instructions on future plans. The Mongolian people are determined to fight against the invasion of bandits and pseudo-armies and follow Chairman Fu to resist to the end. Prince De is ignorant of national consciousness and willingly follows the rebels, which is a great loss to the personality of the descendants of Genghis Khan. I deeply regret this and have repeatedly tried to persuade him, but he has not yet come to his senses. After I arrive in Nanjing, if Chairman Chiang Kai-shek summons me, I may take a trip to Zhejiang. I plan to stay for two weeks before returning to Suiyuan. (Central News Agency dispatch, April 6)</p>
<h3>The Problem of Tax Exemption for Imported Foreign Rice in Guangdong</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] The problem of Guangdong Province's request for the central government to approve tax exemptions for imported foreign rice has been repeatedly petitioned by representatives from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and five provinces and cities. After the Ministry of Finance signed its opinions and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for review, it was brought up for discussion at the routine meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 6th.

The Nanjing Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry on the 6th, stating that there are still about two million piculs of rice waiting to be transported to Guangdong. Why seek it from abroad when local resources are available? It is requested that the original order to exempt foreign rice from taxes for transportation to Guangdong be withdrawn in order to protect the national economy and follow public opinion.

<p>[Chengdu] As a result of Wu Dingchang's meeting with Liu Xiang in Chengdu, it has been determined that Sichuan Province's economic construction undertakings should focus on commerce. If the strength of the merchants is insufficient, it should be supplemented by local forces. If the local forces are insufficient, they should be supplemented by the central forces. Based on this principle, the following concrete agreements have been reached: ㊀ Cooperative treasuries will be established in counties in sequence, starting with twenty selected counties; ㊁ A warehouse network will be built with Chengdu and Chongqing as the center; ㊂ Sichuan timber will be organized; ㊃ The Agricultural Bank will undertake agricultural loans for certain special products; ㊄ The organization of a national products company in Sichuan Province will be assisted; ㊅ The organization of an export trade company in Sichuan Province will be promoted.

Wu's visit to Sichuan this time was fruitful, and his talks with all parties were extremely pleasant. The impressions gained from inspecting various places were also good. Before leaving, he told a reporter from the Central News Agency that all problems between the central and local governments had been resolved, and the discussions with Liu last night lasted for three hours. All matters to be discussed had been specifically resolved, and there would soon be factual manifestations. Liu said that he was determined to engage in Sichuan Province's economic construction and work hard to move forward. The current construction achievements are also quite remarkable. The Agricultural Bank has decided to invest in Sichuan Province to build new-style agricultural warehouses and to establish cooperative treasuries in various counties to regulate rural finance and increase production. Wu was extremely concerned about the severity of the Sichuan disaster and believed that urgent relief should be organized, with soup kitchens set up in the forty most severely affected counties for two months to provide relief specifically to the elderly, weak, women, and children. The able-bodied should be relieved by means of work relief. Wu gave practical instructions on Sichuan Province's construction on this visit, and his contribution to communicating the views between the central and local governments was particularly great.

In the afternoon, the third plenary meeting was held, chaired by Gao Dajing, to discuss many important proposals for effectively promoting the new transportation movement on various railways, such as stipulating that all railway employees nationwide should wear uniforms, promoting two-corner meals to facilitate third- and fourth-class passengers (specifying the amount of white rice, meat, and vegetables, according to the cost of living in each area), suggesting that the general association establish a national railway new transportation association within the Ministry of Railways to specifically hold each railway accountable for promoting the new transportation movement, requesting that the general association forward a letter to the Military Affairs Commission to include railway transportation as one of the military science subjects, and passing a resolution to use the theory of the new transportation movement as one of the educational subjects for railway employees on various lines, requesting that the ministry send personnel to inspect the new transportation movement on various railways, requesting that the promotion of the new transportation movement by railway employees be included as one of the year-end performance evaluations, and several dozen other important proposals, such as mobile labor service groups to facilitate passenger travel. It is planned to determine the entire plan for promoting the new transportation movement on various railways in the first phase, setting a deadline for all railways nationwide to implement it uniformly. Due to the importance of the matter, discussions will continue on the 7th. Zhang Jia'ao hosted a luncheon on the 6th, and the New Life Movement Association will host a reception at the Lishi Society on the afternoon of the 7th, and screen new transportation films to provide entertainment.

<h3>The Political Trends of the Little Entente</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Since Italian Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Yugoslavia last month and the establishment of a bilateral economic agreement, many newspapers have considered the unity of the Little Entente to be gradually disintegrating. However, not long after the Italy-Yugoslavia agreement was established, the Standing Political Council of the Little Entente held a meeting in the South Slav capital at the beginning of this month, lasting for two days. The results of the meeting were quite satisfactory. At the same time, Czech President Beneš visited the South Slav capital on the 5th and received a warm welcome from the Yugoslavian government. Observing these facts, it seems that the unity of the Little Entente is still very solid and has not loosened. This phenomenon seems like a kaleidoscope to us in the distant East, and we can't make heads or tails of it. What is the development of the situation in Southeastern Europe, and what are the political trends of the Little Entente?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we can only say a general statement: the Little Entente is currently at a crossroads. That is to say, on the one hand, there are centrifugal forces trying to break up the Little Entente, and on the other hand, there are centripetal forces trying to strengthen its unity. The recent complex situation is precisely the product of the mutual struggle between these centrifugal and centripetal forces.</p>
<p>When the Little Entente was established in 1924, its purpose was to protect its territory, assist each other, and serve as the periphery of France to confront Germany, Hungary, and other countries. This situation was maintained until last year, when it began to change. The reasons for the change were, on the one hand, the weakness of French foreign policy, which adopted a policy of compromise and concession towards Germany and Italy, leading to internal turmoil in the Little Entente. On the other hand, Germany and Italy adopted a policy of dividing the Little Entente, providing considerable appeasement in politics and economics to make them no longer afraid of Germany and Italy. The implementation of this policy finally achieved excellent results. In particular, the centrifugal tendencies of Romania and Yugoslavia were very strong. For example, Romania reorganized its cabinet last year, squeezing out the pro-French Foreign Minister Titulescu and replacing him with a pro-German cabinet. Yugoslavia concluded an agreement with the pro-Italian Bulgaria in January of this year and recently agreed to an economic agreement with Italy. At the same time, it also entered the economic trap set by Schacht. According to recent developments, the centrifugal tendencies of the Little Entente are very obvious.</p>
<p>However, we cannot conclude that the existence of the Little Entente has faced a very serious crisis because of these situations. Although Yugoslavia and Romania have a strong tendency to leave the Little Entente due to their own interests and the vigorous efforts of Germany and Italy to win them over, the original purpose of establishing the Little Entente has not been completely lost. In particular, the Czech Republic's resolute support for the collective security system and loyalty to the original foreign policy of the Little Entente prevent Romania and Yugoslavia from abruptly throwing themselves into the arms of Germany, Italy, and other countries. At the same time, Germany and Italy's ambitions for aggression in Southern Europe have not been forgotten just because they have put on a peaceful disguise. Looking at the Italy-Yugoslavia agreement, there was a large anti-Italian demonstration in the South Slav capital. The leaders of various opposition parties of the Serbian ethnic group also jointly issued a statement opposing the foreign policy pursued by the Stojadinović cabinet. At the same time, in Romania, King Carol has considered changing his pro-German foreign policy because ambassadors from Germany, Italy, and other countries openly participated in the funeral of members of the dissolved Iron Guard. Judging from these situations, the centripetal force of the Little Entente is still very strong and will not be in danger of disintegration for the time being.</p>
<p>In short, the unity of the Little Entente is indeed not as strong as before, but the development of its future depends on the outcome of the diplomatic war between Germany and Italy and the Franco-Soviet group in Southeastern Europe.</p>
<h3>Japanese Financial Problems Depend on Adjusting Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>Yuki Hopes for Economic Cooperation in North China; Kodama Returns to Tokyo to Submit Opinion</p>
<p>Kyoto - Finance Minister Toyotaro Yuki arrived in Kyoto from Tokyo on the 5th and made the following remarks on the current situation: "The representatives of the House of Representatives are expected to remain largely unchanged after the general election. The government's purpose in dissolving the parliament was to make the political parties reflect on the serious situation. Therefore, if there is no reflective attitude, the government will also take resolute measures to deal with the political parties in an upright manner. The government has no active intention to organize a new party. However, if new people with a correct understanding establish a new party after the general election, the government will not hesitate to provide internal assistance. In my opinion, considering financial and economic issues, the conclusion that the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is the fundamental issue cannot be avoided. We most hope to promote economic cooperation in North China with the true understanding of the people of China and Japan. The military also has the same opinion. In this sense, the visit to China by the Kodama economic mission is meaningful." (6th Domei dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Finance Minister Toyotaro Yuki, who arrived in Kyoto last night, stated in a speech that it would be extremely difficult to implement Japan's future economic policies without considering relations with China. If closer Sino-Japanese economic relations are desired, the overall relations between China and Japan should be adjusted. However, this work can only be carried out gradually. The military currently feels the same way, but still believes that there is no other way to resolve the North China problem other than economic cooperation. Yuki expressed disagreement with many opinions in Japan that Kenji Kodama's visit to China to investigate the results was a failure. Regarding the rumor that Kong Xiangxi will attend the coronation ceremony of King George VI of England and then return to China via the United States, and will stay briefly when passing through Japan, Yuki said that the opinions of responsible politicians from both countries can be reconciled through timely contact with each other. (6th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After returning to Tokyo, Kenji Kodama exchanged views with leaders from Tokyo's financial and business circles on proposals for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations and was extremely busy. Therefore, he has not yet met with Foreign Minister Sato today, but he is determined to report to the Foreign Minister within two or three days and submit concrete proposals. To eliminate the excessively pessimistic atmosphere here regarding the results of the economic mission to China, Kodama made a speech to reporters, detailing various practical achievements, including the resolution to establish a special committee on currency and industry, but acknowledged that the North China issue is of a serious nature, and even after two days of frank discussions with Chinese representatives, no conclusion has been reached. Kodama then reminded the Japanese people to pay attention to the following two points: ① Due to the firm progress of the economy, especially in currency and industry, China has actually completed a unified and independent country. Therefore, in Kodama's opinion, Japan needs to severely correct the path it has taken towards China in the past. ② Regarding the issue of Chinese boycotts of Japanese goods, Kodama believes that it will never happen and pointed out that several large companies in Shanghai are almost full of Japanese goods.

<h3>Japanese Division Commander Conference Sugiama Speech</h3>
<p>Coaching Centralism</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Army Minister Sugiama instructed at the Divisional Commanders Conference today, the main points of which are recorded as follows: "When I first took office, I expressed my belief in rectifying military discipline and completing unity. Taking this conference as an opportunity, I repeatedly stated my thoughts on important matters and made further requests regarding the points of each person's guidance of their subordinates. Since the sudden incident last spring, the entire army has been united and moving forward with extraordinary determination to rectify military discipline and strengthen unity. For more than a year, all radical ideas and various instigations have subsided, and the appearance has been renewed. I am very pleased that the past grandeur of the Imperial Army has gradually been restored to its former glory. In the future, all levels of officers will study their own responsibilities more diligently, lead their subordinates with great vigor, and provide accurate guidance in order to complete strict military discipline and consolidate unity. This is what I hope for. As for the enrichment of military preparations and related matters, this enrichment plan is to cope with the current and future international situation. Among them, the proactive Far East policy to deal with the Soviet Union should maintain the balance of military preparations to prevent war from happening, and to ensure the joint defense of Japan and Manchuria and the permanent peace of East Asia. Therefore, in order to build lasting military preparations to match the ideals of the founding of the country, it is necessary to promote the comprehensive capabilities of the country for a leap forward. This is essential, and I will do my best to complete it. As for the soundness of military preparations and the completeness of the function, it must be subject to strict training, that is, to get rid of the old routines, and make the measures under the jurisdiction of the military uniformly take the coaching-centric doctrine. Therefore, I hope to work hard to provide guidance and have high hopes for this." (6th Domei News Agency dispatch)</p>

<h3>China Will Surely Become Rich and Strong</h3>
<p>French Newspaper Discusses China's Economy, Three Major Advantages of Development</p>
<p>[Paris] Romier, the manager of the right-wing Figaro newspaper, is currently inspecting the Far East and recently published an article in the newspaper discussing the impact that China's modernization may have. Romier's article elaborates on the possibilities of China's economic evolution, stating, "China can leap to wealth and strength, and it has various different potential factors. First, the human factor. China has a large and countless number of workers, who have the aspirations to improve and the genius of manufacturing. The commodities they produce are often ingenious and are satisfied with low wages. Many have gone abroad to trade and migrate to different cities, and they can adapt to circumstances and prosper everywhere, which is their strength. Second, the market factor. China has a vast domestic market that is unparalleled. Commodities can be sold out in the domestic market alone, and the cost will naturally be lower than imported goods. Third, the commercial factor. Chinese people overseas mostly have the special skills of doing business. In Southeast Asia, from the Dutch East Indies to Burma, from the Malay Peninsula and Siam to Vietnam, the workers, trade, and lending are almost entirely controlled by overseas Chinese. China's economic development has the above advantages, and it will surely prosper in the future and take the place of Westerners in the Far East. This can be used as a lesson for the three countries of the United States, Russia, and Japan. The United States once absorbed a large amount of European capital to develop its territory, and now it has leapt to become a powerful enemy of Europe. Its domestic market has been sealed off and cannot be touched by European countries. The Soviet Union is also on the path to industrialization. In ten years, half of the Asian market will be under its control. As for Japan, it is now relying on its mass production and low prices to break the commercial positions occupied by white people along the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean. If China follows suit and develops its inherent economic factors, the commercial expansion of European countries in the Far East will inevitably be hindered, which is a natural reason."

<h3>Murder of German Professor Dielanz in Kaifeng</h3>
<p>Germany Urges Arrest of Murderer</p>
<p>[Berlin] The Berliner Tageblatt, under the headline "Kaifeng Assassination Case Still Unresolved," reported on the assassination of German Professor Dielanz of Henan University last May, stating that Dielanz's assassination had attracted great attention in educational circles, as he was highly respected by university staff and was the only German citizen in Kaifeng. It went on to say that last October, the Chinese government had sentenced a rickshaw puller to twelve years in prison and deprived him of his civil rights for eight years for being an accomplice in the case. However, the other criminals have not yet been apprehended. The difficulty of Germany's investigation into this case has not yet been clarified. It is regrettable that the main culprit of the assassination has not yet been arrested. It is hoped that the competent authorities of the Chinese government will soon investigate everything, punish the murderers, and conclude this case. (Sixth, Kuo Min Hai Telegram)</p>

<h3>Britain, France, and Belgium Advocate World Economic Peace</h3>
<p>Premier Takes the Lead in Collecting Reports; Germany Willing to Participate but Opposes Discussing Politics</p>
<p>[Paris] It was announced here today that Britain and France have asked Belgian Prime Minister Janson to compile a report on the state of the world economy as a basis for convening a world economic conference. A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that it would take a year to complete the collection of this report. Before the report is submitted, no meetings are planned. However, after the report is completed, France hopes to convene a world conference to continue the unfinished work of the 1933 London Economic Conference. (Fifth, Kuo Min Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed sources in London deny the rumor that the British, French, and Belgian governments will convene an international economic conference after exchanging views. The origin of this rumor is likely due to the trilateral financial declaration of last September, which drew attention to the importance of free international trade, and the fact that the League of Nations General Assembly also expressed that international trade should be facilitated. These facts are well known. Some speculate that the governments concerned have not forgotten this process, hence the speculation that an international economic conference is about to be convened. In fact, although the British and French governments have contacted the Belgian government to seek ways to initiate a movement to reduce trade barriers such as quotas, the convening of an international conference is not yet a certainty and is still under consideration. Initially, it will focus on Europe, but the US government has also been notified, as it is very interested in the whole matter. (Fifth, Reuters from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Brussels: Regarding the proposal by the British and French governments that Belgian Prime Minister Janson contact various countries to reduce tariff barriers, it is generally expected that Prime Minister Janson will accept the proposal after the cabinet meeting tomorrow night. Diplomatic circles are currently unwilling to comment on this matter, but political circles believe that the Prime Minister may entrust several well-known Belgian economists to travel to the capitals of major countries to conduct research and investigation as preparation, and then Prime Minister Janson will synthesize the results of the investigation and negotiate with the authorities of various countries. The scope of contact should be as broad as possible, aiming to include all countries in the world, but in any case, a world economic conference will not be convened in the near future. (Fifth, Havas from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] British and French political circles are considering convening an international conference to deal with peace and business issues. Germany is prepared to participate in this effort to restore normalcy to international trade. The difficulties encountered by German commerce are very clear and are the main reason for the Four-Year Plan. However, Germany welcomes the suggestions of the London Sugar Conference for the recovery of world commerce, but opposes any plan that links economic agreements with political rights. It is believed here that Janson's proposal is not in his capacity as the Belgian Prime Minister, but only as an economic expert, requesting to study this issue. Moreover, this step is only a preliminary plan and not a joint action by Britain, France, and Belgium. (Sixth, Kuo Min Hai Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wilson College Awards Hull Memorial Medal</h3>
<p>For Contributions to Promoting Economic Peace; US Has Reciprocity with Sixteen Countries</p>
<p>[New York] Wilson College recently awarded a commemorative medal to Secretary of State Hull for his efforts in promoting economic peace. In accepting the award, Hull delivered a speech stating that the main reason for the 1929 world economic panic was that countries failed to implement sound and constructive policies in their economic relations. It should be known that after the economic wars between countries, without establishing a peaceful situation, there is no hope for a genuine economic recovery. The US government deeply understands this and has been implementing a new policy for the past three years, which has been welcomed by other countries. Sixteen countries have signed reciprocal trade agreements with the US, and the international situation has shown a glimmer of hope. It is regrettable that the opposite trend cannot be prevented. If a certain country's economy, which was originally very poor, is spending its meager financial resources on an unprecedented arms race, then there is no way to improve the world economic situation, and there is nothing strange about it. Now, if we want to make up for our losses, we can only rely on the cooperation of countries preparing for war and countries striving for peace, so that international political and economic relations can be reorganized on the basis of friendly relations and cooperation. (Fifth, Havas from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[New York] Armstrong, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Wilson Memorial Fund, said that countries that advocate isolationism do not allow trade to follow its natural course, because their purpose is not to seek commercial prosperity, but to seek national power. Britain is not like this and can accept treaties like those Hull has negotiated with other countries, and at the same time, it does not need to make many changes to its current imperial conference system.

<h3>International Sugar Conference</h3>
<p>British Government Hosts; Representatives Speak</p>
<p>[London] The British government hosted a banquet last night for representatives from various countries attending the World Sugar Conference. Chinese Ambassador Quo Tai-chi was also present, as were the ambassadors from Japan and the Netherlands. British Privy Councilor MacDonald delivered a speech, advocating for fairness for producers. MacDonald also praised US envoy Davis for his efforts in world peace and commended Dutch Prime Minister Colijn. According to MacDonald, the World Sugar Conference has had an excellent start. With international goodwill and frank discussions, all difficulties can be overcome. Davis said that all countries in the world now understand that even if concessions are made on the sugar issue, there will be no sacrifice, because if an agreement can be reached, not only will the economic situation of various countries improve, but also world peace and prosperity will benefit. (Sixth, Reuters from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] US Chief Representative to the International Sugar Conference Davis told the preparatory committee today that the US is prepared to conclude an international agreement to bring sugar trade back on track, but the US delegation's position still needs to be approved by Congress. Davis also said that the US hopes that other countries can make similar contributions. In this way, the US is prepared to limit its sales in foreign markets and can guarantee that other countries will still be able to sell at least their existing amounts in the US market. It is reported that the Cuban representative will state that the Chadbourne Agreement of 1931 failed to raise sugar prices, so that Cuba's restriction of production was a futile sacrifice. Therefore, Cuba may request a new agreement, asking countries that did not participate in the Chadbourne Agreement to also restrict production. Some experts believe that if all sugar-producing countries in the world can abide by the conditions of the Chadbourne Agreement, its effectiveness can be greatly increased. However, some also believe that if people in the sugar industry can follow the example of the previous dairy and fruit industries, and widely promote sugar consumption to increase consumption, they can also achieve their ideal goals. Davis said that the decline of the world sugar market is due to excessive subsidies from various governments. Davis estimated that last year, direct and indirect subsidies from various countries reached US$100 million, causing taxpayers and consumers to bear too much burden. The US sugar import quota regulations will expire this year, and he hopes that this policy can be implemented permanently to help the economic situation of countries exporting sugar to the US. (Fifth, Kuo Min Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] One of the most important issues discussed at the World Sugar Conference is the production of the British Empire. The conference opened today, chaired by British Privy Councilor MacDonald. This conference is a result of the 1933 World Economic and Financial Conference. The first task after the conference opens is to organize a committee of experts to review the statistical data provided by the delegations of various countries. This committee has been established, and its expert members include Hudson from the United States, Meek from India, and Norfolk from the Netherlands. Furthermore, the production of the British Empire will likely become the focus of subsequent debates. The autonomous regions and colonies have decided to maintain the benefits they have already obtained in previous conferences, and the British Empire has invested £40 million in the domestic sugar beet industry, so it has no intention of giving it up. On the other hand, producing countries such as Cuba, the Netherlands, and Czechoslovakia are extremely hopeful that the British Empire can limit its production so that sugar growers can enjoy the huge profits of the European War period, when sugar prices were as high as £140 per ton, while currently they are only £6.5.</p>
<p>Today, after the opening of the World Sugar Conference, speeches were delivered by US representative Davis, Polish representative Ambassador Lecinski, British representative Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore, Cuban representative Menna, Australian representative Casey, Philippine representative Buen Camino, and Peruvian representative Baldo. According to today's official announcement, the task of the representatives is to state the special circumstances of their respective countries' sugar production and report on the policies adopted by their respective governments, in order to see whether they can follow the method of some reasonable sacrifice to form a common agreement and increase the interests of the public. MacDonald said in his opening remarks that the most important task of this conference is to give some stability and security to the world's sugar industry. MacDonald added that the purpose of the conference is to protect the interests of producers, but the interests of consumers should not be ignored. The British Empire itself is also a very large consumer, so it is determined not to see sugar prices rise above a reasonable economic balance. The reason why we must seek the stability of the sugar industry is to maintain the balance between production and consumption. We must also remember that in some countries, sugar consumption is being vigorously suppressed due to the high retail price." MacDonald advocated that this conference should find a way to establish a national defense agreement to maintain a considerable balance between supply and demand in the world market.</p>
<p>A total of 22 countries participated in the conference, but Italy's absence has attracted much attention from the outside world. Among the countries, some domestic production is economically subsidized by the government, and since the European War, production has increased greatly, and prices have fallen sharply, thus the economy of each exporting country has been greatly affected. What the UK is concerned about is, firstly, the domestic production, which has become a major item in the national agricultural policy, and secondly, the sugarcane production in the colonies. And according to Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore before the opening of the sugar conference, the interests of the colonies will be the premise considered by the British government.

<h3>Delicate Relations Develop Among Russia, Germany, and France</h3>

<p>[Paris] After the Soviet Ambassador to France, Potemkin, was transferred to the position of Deputy Commissioner of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, the newspapers here are mostly talking about whether the Soviet Union will change its diplomatic policy. The People's Friend reported, "It is said that Germany's diplomatic policy is about to change, so as to cooperate with the Soviet Union, China, and Japan. This policy was proposed by General Reichenau, the liaison officer between the German government and the army. Regarding this, Moscow has recently held important talks, wanting to choose between Germany and France. As a result, the pro-French faction won. From this, it can be seen that the Mutual Assistance Pact between France and the Soviet Union can easily prevent the establishment of an agreement between Germany and the Soviet Union. Those who support this pact are indeed prescient." Le Matin reported, "Ambassador Potemkin has always been known for advocating the easing of the situation in Eastern Europe, and is eager for Germany and the Soviet Union to reconcile. Now that he has been transferred to the position of Deputy Foreign Minister, he may try to change the mutual assistance policy promoted by former French Foreign Minister Barthou and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, so that Germany and the Soviet Union can repair their old relationship."

<p>[Berlin] Regarding the news from the British side that Germany will send an inspection team to China, partly composed of military officers, in order to promote Sino-Japanese relations, authoritative sources here stated that the rumor is definitely not true. (Fifth, Kuo Min Hai Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Since Head of State Hitler reconciled with General Ludendorff, a famous general of the European War, rumors have sprung up everywhere, and National Socialist Party members have also felt uneasy, believing that the day when General Ludendorff rises again is the day when the German situation is serious, just like the intense period of the European War in August 1916, or at least not far from this point. As for the Christian church, this move clearly implicitly indicates that the authorities are about to take major action on the issue of anti-Christianity. In view of this, semi-official circles issued a statement saying that the reconciliation between the Head of State and Ludendorff was used to end the discord between the National Socialist Party and the famous army general. There is no intention to invite Ludendorff to rejoin active service, nor to impose various restrictions or invite a certain Christian church. (Sixth, Havas from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] The right-wing Le Figaro recently reported that all of the Soviet Union's gold has been transported to London for storage, amounting to as much as 36 million pounds. There are two purposes for this move: ⑴ to show the world that the country has become one of the world's largest gold producers; ⑵ to store the funds in London in preparation for war.

<h3>Soviet Political Situation</h3>
<p>Minister of Postal and Telecommunications Appointed Successor</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Central Executive Committee decided to appoint Khalevsky as the Commissioner of Postal and Telecommunications. Khalevsky was born in 1893 and actively participated in the civil war. In 1921, he served as the Director of Transportation for the Red Army. In 1924, he served as the Director of the Military Technology Bureau of the Red Army. In 1929, he was the Director of the Motorization and Mechanization Administration of the Red Army. (Sixth, TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Le Petit Parisien recently published a Moscow dispatch, which described the dismissal of Soviet People's Commissar for Postal and Telecommunications Yagoda. It is said that Yagoda recently fell out of favor, so he used fine wine and women to relieve his boredom. In several months, he embezzled nearly one million rubles of public funds. After the incident, he was dismissed. It is estimated that there will be important developments in this case. (Fifth, Havas from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] Le Matin's London correspondent recently revealed the situation of the repeated conversations between Soviet People's Commissar for Defense Voroshilov and the country's dictator Stalin. It is said that Voroshilov declared to Stalin that the Soviet armories were working under the supervision of the political police. In 1936, a large number of shells were manufactured, which did not correspond to the caliber of the artillery positions. Twenty percent of them should be destroyed. After hearing the news, Stalin immediately summoned Yezhov, the head of the political police, and asked why those who sabotaged national defense were not arrested. Yezhov blamed the matter on the former Commissioner of Postal and Telecommunications Yagoda. This is the reason why Yagoda was dismissed. In addition, there is concern that the Commissioner of Transportation Kaganovich will lose his position because the Army General Staff is dissatisfied with the current state of the railway. (Sixth, Havas from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Soviet Russian Defense Commissioner Voroshilov recently issued an order stipulating that from April 1, the military pay of the party army will be increased by 30 percent across the board. At the same time, disability pensions will also be increased to 65 rubles. (Sixth, Kuo Min Hai Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] US Ambassador to Russia Davis returned home to report on his duties and arrived here today. He said that under the leadership of Stalin and other leaders, the Soviet Union's nation-building achievements are remarkable. The Soviet leaders work hard and are commendable. Davis plans to return to his post in mid-June. (Sixth, Kuo Min Telegram)</p>

<h3>Plans of a Certain Party to Operate the Tianjin East Salt Flats</h3>
<p>Building Piers, Constructing Paper Mills, Cultivating Reeds, and Planting Cotton; Setting Up Two Model Villages to Deceive the Villagers; Changlu Transportation Office's Efforts to Prevent the Sale Prove Ineffective</p>
<p>Tianjin dispatch: The case of the traitor Shao Hanqing's illegal sale of the Tianjin East salt flats to a certain party has been finalized. It is found that the salt flats are located in the area from Beitang to Yingcheng (previously mistakenly referred to as Yingcheng) in eastern Tianjin. When the traitor first contacted a certain party, the Changlu Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report the matter and dispatched personnel to persuade the landowners to desist. However, the salt flats fall under the jurisdiction of Ninghe County, and Ninghe is under the organization of "Eastern Hebei." Although the Transportation Commissioner's Office could persuade, it could not forcefully prevent the sale. However, to preserve this vast land and prevent its sovereignty from being lost, two remedial measures were proposed: ㊀ The Changlu Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office would purchase it at the same price. ㊁ The Ministry of Finance's Changlu Salt Zone Land Improvement Committee would provide loans to improve the soil and geology, enabling the local people to cultivate the land and maintain their livelihoods. The office then instructed Tong Xingwu, director of the Hangu Salt Tuo Inspection Office, to contact Shao Jinghan, the representative of the landowners, back and forth. Ultimately, because Yin Rugeng, a traitor, sought to please a certain party, he interfered and prevented them from heeding the prohibition, thus allowing a certain party to achieve their wish.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Salt Flats: The Changlu Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office repeatedly received reports from beach households and stove households in Denggu, Hangu, Lutai, Beitang, and other places, stating that a certain party, having purchased such a large salt flat and possessing substantial capital, would open salt ponds and dump salt at low prices. Tens of thousands of beach and stove households would inevitably be squeezed out and deprived of their livelihoods. They requested negotiations to impose restrictions. The Transportation Commissioner's Office conveyed the public opinion of the various beach and stove households to a certain party, requesting their attention. A certain party recently replied to the Changlu Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office, stating that they were leasing the beach land for other purposes and would definitely not set up salt yards to deprive the beach and stove households of their business. However, according to investigations, the uses of the beach by a certain party are approximately as follows: ㊀ Opening up a wharf in the coastal area to facilitate the berthing of transport ships, making it the only loading and unloading port besides Tanggu and Dagu. ㊁ Constructing a paper mill to manufacture newsprint, printing paper, and coarse-edged paper needed in North China. ㊂ Continuing to carefully protect the existing reed areas to ensure their prosperity, providing raw materials for papermaking. ㊃ Planting cotton in areas where reeds do not grow, supplying Japanese-owned yarn factories in Tianjin, Tangshan, and other places.</p>
<p>Content of the Terms: The salt flats were sold to a certain party because Yin Rugeng, a traitor, sought to ingratiate himself with that party and took advantage of the situation to mediate. The beach land is jointly owned by the Shao clan. Although there were one or two people among them who were deeply aware of the righteousness, they ultimately could not control the overall situation due to environmental factors. The person responsible for the contact was the traitor Shao Hanqing. However, when signing the contract in the future, another traitor will come forward in name. Shao Hanqing in Tianjin negotiated the following terms with a certain party: ㊀ The salt flat land is 80,000 mu, with a lease term of 30 years. ㊁ The rent is 2.5 yuan per mu, totaling 200,000 yuan, to be paid in full at once. ㊂ The lessee (i.e., a certain party) has absolute freedom to build piers, factories, and other construction projects, but all labor must employ local villagers to show cooperation. A certain party has fully agreed to the above terms. The traitor Shao Hanqing has returned from Tianjin to Hangu to convey this to other landowners. After obtaining their consent, he will return to Tianjin to sign the contract. In addition, regarding the lease term, a certain party originally intended to purchase or lease permanently, but after repeated negotiations by the Changlu Transportation Commissioner's Office, it was changed to a lease term of 30 years.</p>
<p>Deceiving the Villagers: A certain party coveted the beach land and, in addition to realizing its plans to open a wharf, build a paper mill, cultivate reeds, and plant cotton, it has also decided to open two model villages north and south of Hangu to deceive the local villagers. Each village will accommodate 100 households, and each household will be allocated 50 mu of land. Those who are smart and hardworking can increase to 100 mu. A certain party will provide guidance in planting cotton and raising livestock, and there will be entertainment venues, restaurants, bathhouses, and other facilities. Remedial schools will also be established to instill so-called "friendship" education. Looking at this plan, the 80,000 mu of beach land is like another small world, subject to the control of a certain party. Yin Rugeng's betrayal is truly hateful. The Changlu Transportation Commissioner's Office reported this to the Ministry of Finance in detail via telegram on the morning of the 3rd. (4th)</p>
<h3>Ningbo Holds Aquatic Products Exhibition</h3>

<h3>Xiamen Chamber of Commerce Petitions for Unified Land Tax and Abolition of Special Taxes</h3>
<p>House Tax and Three Other Taxes Collected Annually Total Over 400,000 Yuan; Special Business Tax Collected Based on Goods is Equivalent to Lijin</p>
<p>Xiamen dispatch: The Xiamen Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance on March 31st, earnestly requesting the Fujian Provincial Government to abolish Xiamen's House and Shop Donation, Land Rent, and Police Donation, and to unify the collection of land tax. The reason is that Xiamen City has a population of over 181,000 people, comprising over 32,600 households. There are three types of house and land taxes: the annual collection of House and Shop Donation is over 100,000 yuan, the annual collection of Land Rent is 80,000 yuan, and the Police Donation, collected based on the rent rate, is over 240,000 yuan per year, totaling over 430,000 yuan. The burden on property owners and residents is extremely heavy. The memorial to the Executive Yuan stated, "Xiamen City is a small island of only 30 li, but the taxes and levies are numerous and burdensome, unparalleled anywhere else. Regarding land tax, the House and Shop Donation, Land Rent, and Police Donation are all collected. The Land Rent has increased from over 4,000 yuan to 80,000 yuan annually, the House and Shop Donation has increased from over 30,000 yuan to over 100,000 yuan annually, and the Police Donation has increased from over 100,000 yuan to over 200,000 yuan annually. Such repeated and heavy taxation is unbearable for the people of Xiamen. Upon investigation, cities as far away as Taiyuan, as close as Shantou, and as prosperous as Hankou do not have a House and Shop Donation. Even in other places where the House and Shop Donation is collected, it is mostly used for police expenses, and a separate Police Donation is not collected. The Land Rent, on the other hand, is unique to Xiamen, not found in other provinces, cities, or counties in this province. All three are taxes levied on houses, stacking taxes upon taxes, which is far from the central government's aim of unifying the tax system and abolishing excessive and miscellaneous levies. Furthermore, all compulsory levies on the people by the central and local governments should first be decided in principle by the Central Political Conference and reviewed in content by the Legislative Yuan before they can be established. The instructions of the Executive Yuan are clear and easy to verify. The House and Shop Donation, Land Rent, and Police Donation have not been handled in accordance with the regulations and have no legal basis, so there is no possibility of their continued existence. (Omitted) We respectfully present this appeal and earnestly request that you approve and order the Fujian Provincial Government to abolish Xiamen's House and Shop Donation, Land Rent, and Police Donation immediately, and to unify the collection of land tax, in order to uphold the law and relieve the people's hardship."</p>
<p>On the 1st of this month, the City Chamber of Commerce again petitioned the Executive Yuan, requesting that the Fujian Provincial Government abolish the illegal Special Business Tax. The original petition stated, "The collection of business tax in Fujian Province has not been carried out in accordance with the regulations and chapters of the Ministry. The severity of the tax is even worse than Lijin. Furthermore, it has intensified, with the establishment of special business taxes on items such as sugar, tea, seafood, fertilizer, kerosene, wax candles, black oil, and old newspapers. Taxes are levied on goods, and those who transport and sell these goods must obtain a transportation permit. Each piece of goods must also have a voucher attached before it can be released. The harshness of the tax rate (all above 50 per thousand) and the complexity of the procedures are even worse than Lijin. This not only hinders the development of industry and commerce but also violates the central government's orders. (Omitted) We earnestly request that you order the Fujian Provincial Government to abolish the Special Business Tax and to collect various business taxes in accordance with the tax rates promulgated by the Ministry." Both of the above petitions also stated, "The income tax has been levied, and excessive and miscellaneous taxes should be abolished. The central government has long issued a circular, and if it is not corrected according to law, there is no way to show the government's great credibility and maintain the dignity of the law." Furthermore, regarding the collection of Police Donation, the regulations of the 20th year of the Republic stipulated that shops should be taxed at 8% of the rent, and residences should be taxed at 2% of the rent. In recent years, land prices have plummeted, and land and rent have fallen by more than 60%. Although the rent has decreased, the Police Donation is still collected at the old rate, and there are arbitrary and standardless assessments. Those who do not pay are arrested for tax resistance. As a result, disputes between the government and merchants are becoming increasingly intense. The City Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the City Government on March 15th, requesting that the tax be collected at the original rate based on the actual amount of rent. The City Government replied, "The monthly expenditure for police salaries is over 30,000 yuan, and the police donation collected is around 20,000 yuan, so the revenue and expenditure are disparate and it is difficult to approve." The City Chamber of Commerce, not having received approval, submitted another petition to the City Government on the 30th, stating that in addition to police salaries, there are also donations for entertainment, sanitation, slaughter, automobiles, and rickshaws, which have a monthly surplus. When was the police donation rate changed, what is the standard, and what is the donation rate? Please order the Finance Bureau to announce the police donation standards and collect taxes according to law. The official and business sides are almost in a stalemate. (April 2nd)</p>
<h3>The Truth About the Righteous Army's Attack on Sanxingzhen in Songhua River</h3>
<p>Using Opium Dens as a Venue for the Uprising; Killing Over 300 Japanese Officers and Soldiers; Nearly 200 Japanese Women and Children Killed</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" published a dispatch from Harbin on March 27th stating that, according to eyewitnesses, the truth about the anti-Japanese elements' attack on Sanxingzhen in Songhua River is very different from what has been published here. According to currently available information, the Japanese authorities had allowed Chinese in the three northeastern provinces to open opium dens. This time, the anti-Japanese elements used the opium dens to infiltrate Sanxingzhen without being detected. The Japanese authorities originally intended to use the opening of opium dens to gather information about the anti-Japanese movement, but the result was the opposite. Sanxingzhen had a total of 25 opium dens, whose customers were mostly farmers and villagers from the surrounding areas. The Chinese who opposed the current government used these opium dens as a convenient place to gather for the uprising. This time, the anti-Japanese elements learned that several Japanese garrison officers would be gathering at a brothel for entertainment on a certain night. They agreed to attack the Japanese in the town from various opium dens at 11:00 p.m. At the same time, comrades outside the town also attacked. They were all carrying weapons such as machine guns. Therefore, as soon as they entered the town, they opened fire on the main streets. Opposite a large opium den was a brothel. The anti-Japanese elements attacked it first, killing all 16 Japanese military officers who were drinking and making merry inside. The Japanese prostitutes also all perished. Another team of anti-Japanese elements attacked the Japanese barracks, entering through the back door. Another team was responsible for attacking the Japanese in the streets and looting and burning Japanese residences. They killed any Japanese they saw. It is estimated that 42 Japanese officers and soldiers were killed in the street fighting. They also kidnapped 31 important Japanese residents, planning to ransom them. The Japanese soldiers in the camp were caught off guard and did not even have time to grab their rifles to fight back. Therefore, it is said that all 282 soldiers in the camp were annihilated, as the anti-Japanese elements vowed not to let a single Japanese soldier survive. Another part of the Japanese soldiers hid in the bomb shelters when the alarm was sounded. Because the anti-Japanese elements could not attack, they were able to save their lives. As for the Japanese civilians, it is said that a total of 172 women and children were killed, mostly prostitutes, because this group was very prevalent in the towns where Japanese soldiers were stationed. According to the Chinese in the town, none of the Chinese residences were affected by the incident because the anti-Japanese elements were dedicated to burning Japanese property. After slaughtering all night, at 5:00 a.m. the next morning, two battalions of Japanese soldiers arrived from a neighboring town. Therefore, they left the town and fled into the deep mountains and forests, and the Japanese soldiers could not pursue them.</p>

<p>Cibei Seizes Illegally Manufactured Cigarettes</p>
<p>The Second District Team of the Yong Tax Police received a secret report at 9:00 p.m. on the 3rd, knowing that someone in Jiangjia Village, Guanhaiwei, Sanbei, was illegally manufacturing cigarettes. The team leader led 20 tax police to the area and seized a large hand-cranked machine, 30 to 40 catties of shredded tobacco, three and a half plates of cigarette paper, and other parts such as cigarette rolling machines. The criminals Jiang Huashu and others, five people, were taken to Yong in the middle of the night, arriving at the team at 5:00 a.m. the next morning.</p>
<p>贝母放弃统制</p>
<p>Fritillaria Abandoned Control</p>
<p>Fritillaria thunbergii is one of the special products of Yin County. Since the cooperative was formed, the price of fritillaria has soared, increasing to more than 70 yuan per 100 catties. The rural economy has benefited greatly. The cooperative was dissolved last year, and the lawsuit has not yet ended. The government side, because there is no huge amount of money at the moment and does not want the rights and interests to spill out, has not added control after the fresh fritillaria was unearthed this year, and farmers sell and sell themselves. However, as medicine merchants seize the opportunity to manipulate, the price of fritillaria has plummeted to 15 yuan per 100 catties. Farmers sell painfully, with huge losses.</p>

<h3>Citizens Unanimously Oppose Increased Donation</h3>
<p>Writing to Request the Foreigners' Association to Reject; Requesting Chinese Directors to Submit Reconsideration</p>
<p>The Citizens' United Association of the First Special District of this city sent a letter to the Foreign Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession yesterday morning, saying, "Dear Sirs, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession, regardless of the difficult times, actually passed a proposal at the Board of Directors meeting on March 24th to increase the general municipal donation by 2%, that is, from 14% to 16%, and the land tax by 1 per thousand, that is, from 7 per thousand to 8 per thousand. It is preparing to submit it to the Ratepayers' Meeting for approval and implementation, which is deeply shocking. The Association convened an emergency representative meeting on March 27th to discuss it. All agreed that the market has been declining in recent years, and the suffering of industry and commerce is common knowledge both domestically and abroad. If the Municipal Council disregards the reality and insists on increasing the donation, it will inevitably lead to serious disputes. It was resolved to write to the Ratepayers' Association to reject it. I am specially writing to you, hoping that your association will show the whole fact, weigh the pros and cons, and refuse to discuss or reject the increase in donation, in order to meet the expectations of the ratepayers and avoid provoking unfortunate incidents. I hope so very much." To the Foreign Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>The Nanjing Road Business Federation and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association also sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association yesterday, expressing another opinion. The original text said, "Dear Sirs, on March 14th, the Municipal Council Board of Directors meeting passed a proposal to increase the general donation by two percent, with six votes against five, and decided to implement it from July 1st. As soon as this news was spread, it aroused the backlash of the citizens. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, various industry associations, the Citizens' United Association, and various district branches and fellow villagers associations in Shanghai have successively contributed their opinions and put forward their demands, unanimously expressing insufficient reasons for the increased donation and proposing points to balance revenue and expenditure, such as the music team, which is irrelevant to the interests of all citizens and only provides pleasing entertainment for a very small number of people, and the White Russian team, which is insufficient to cope with the serious situation in times of emergency, can be cancelled. Implement empty house taxation, reduce the high salaries of foreign employees, cancel nominal staff and foreign employee exchange allowances, and strictly urge the huge amount of arrears in donations, etc., which are all essential. The Executive Committee of our Association convened a meeting to discuss this matter, and all agreed that citizens who have the obligation to pay taxes can elect directors to represent the citizens, participate in all municipal facilities, and economic distribution. At this meeting, none of our five Chinese directors approved the increased donation, which was able to represent public opinion and take into account the economic burden of the citizens, which is very admirable. However, the passage of this case is extremely unnatural. The number of representatives of our Chinese directors accounts for more than 64% of the amount of donations and more than 95% of the population, which is of great importance and cannot be ignored. Now that there is public opinion behind it, your association should actively remedy and strictly preside, and immediately organize an expert committee to study the Shanghai Municipal Council's budget account. For each item of expenditure, whether there are unreasonable places, whether the points raised by our taxpayers have value for adoption. When there is a conclusion, then the rationality of our taxpayers' claims will be more accurately proven, and major frugality can be achieved without increasing the donation. At that time, the Chinese directors can submit a reconsideration and cancel the previous case. I think the municipal authorities will never act arbitrarily and not take the will of the taxpayers as their will. If a reconsideration is submitted and the purpose of cancellation is not achieved, our entire citizens will inevitably take effective action to support our Chinese directors. Your association is the statutory general group of Chinese taxpayers, so I decided to narrate my humble opinion and write to you for your reference and handling, and I hope to get a reply in advance."</p>
<h3>Sixth Day of the Fourth Annual Meeting of the Medical Association</h3>
<p>Establishment of Various Academic Societies; Gan Naiguang Speaks on Opium Suppression</p>
<p>The Fourth Annual Meeting of the Chinese Medical Association was held yesterday, its sixth day. In the morning, there were reports from various group meetings. At noon, the Southeast and Tongde Medical Schools hosted a banquet for all members. In the afternoon, Central Committee member Gan Naiguang gave a speech on the "Opium Suppression Problem," and various academic societies were established. There was also a visit to the Shanghai Municipal Council Slaughterhouse and the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital. In the evening, there was an annual banquet and meeting of the Chinese Society for Pathology and Microbiology. The details of each are recorded below.</p>
<p>Reports from Various Committees: From 9:00 AM, there were reports from various committees, including: ① the Pharmaceutical Chemistry Committee; ② the Medical Education Committee; and ③ the Medical History Committee. During the meeting of the Medical Education Committee, Dr. Zhu Zhanggeng, Secretary of the Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, was invited to give a speech. His topic was "Two Years of Medical Education," divided into: 1. Medical Education and its Evolution; 2. An Overview of the Advancement of Medical Education in China in the Past Two Years: A. Improving the Organization of Medical Education Administration; B. Correcting the Goals and Concepts of Medical Education; C. Defining Academic Systems and Curriculum Standards; D. Cultivating Teachers; E. Subsidizing Insufficient Funds; F. Enriching Practical Training Facilities; G. Compiling Teaching Materials and Unifying Teaching Language.</p>
<p>Establishment of Various Academic Societies: Yesterday, various academic societies were established, including: ① the Pediatric Society, with Zhu Shenzhi as President; ② the Internal Medicine Society, with Qi Shoufu as President; ③ the Public Health Society, with Wu Liande as President; and ④ the Medical History Society, with Wang Jimin as President.</p>
<p>Gan Naiguang Speaks on Opium Suppression: Starting at 2:00 PM, Central Committee member Gan Naiguang was invited to the meeting place to give a speech on the "Opium Suppression Problem." He stated that the scourge of opium has been prevalent in China for over a century. The Chinese government initially attempted to ban it. In 1935, after Chairman Chiang Kai-shek concurrently assumed the position of Opium Suppression Commissioner, the planting, transportation, sale, and consumption of opium were all placed under government control, with the aim of gradually eliminating it within six years, from 1935 to 1940. During this period, elderly and sick addicts were required to register with the government, obtain licenses, and gradually quit within a set time limit. Those who failed to quit opium addiction according to the law would be subject to the death penalty. In 1934, there were 547 opium addiction treatment centers in the country, which increased to 970 last year, along with 323 branch institutions. Last year, all provinces and cities were instructed to conduct detailed surveys of the number of opium addicts and drug offenders. Any area with 20,000 people should establish 200 opium addiction treatment posts, increasing or decreasing the number of posts proportionally. This demonstrates that while the government is vigorously implementing opium and drug suppression, it is also showing a spirit of care, allowing ordinary opium addicts and drug offenders to have ample opportunities for rehabilitation. However, the public often fails to seek treatment on their own. The wealthy are concerned about their reputation, while the poor are unable to abandon their work to seek treatment due to their livelihood. However, the government continues to seek convenient methods out of a spirit of care, and is planning to produce oral medications. Although there are hundreds of types on the market, they either contain substitutes or are difficult to be effective. Therefore, it is hoped that all medical experts will pay special attention to this matter, research, and invent effective opium addiction treatment medications, so that opium addicts and drug offenders can benefit greatly.</p>
<p>Opium Addiction Treatment Institutions in Various Regions: In his speech, Gan Naiguang announced the number of opium addiction treatment institutions in various provinces and cities in 1936 as follows: Hebei: 130; Jiangxi: 119; Hunan: 109; Shanxi: 106; Shandong: 113; Shaanxi: 67; Anhui: 90; Jiangsu: 61; Zhejiang: 138; Guizhou: 54; Hubei: 119; Sichuan: 41; Gansu: 19; Fujian: 8; Ningxia: 10; Hunan: 59; Chahar: 13; Qinghai: 5; Shanghai: 21; Qingdao: 3; Nanjing: 2; Beiping: 2; Tianjin: 2; Weihaiwei: 2. A total of 1,293 institutions.</p>
<p>Number of Opium Addicts in Various Regions: He also announced the registered number of opium addicts in various provinces and cities, totaling: Sichuan: 1,295,569; Shaanxi: 358,979; Hubei: 340,218; Anhui: 223,181; Hunan: 220,763; Shanxi: 207,582; Gansu: 176,172; Yunnan: 176,120; Jiangxi: 137,731; Ningxia: 123,564; Jiangsu: 122,934; Fujian: 111,482; Henan: 102,237; Guizhou: 97,904; Shanghai: 43,259; Suiyuan: 42,259; Beiping: 4,953; Qinghai: 1,554; Tianjin: 146. A total of 3,786,608.</p>
<p>Exhibition of Medical History Literature: At this conference, the Medical History Committee, led by Wang Chizhi, organized an exhibition of Chinese medical history literature, displaying approximately 2,000 items. These were collected by over 30 renowned scholars from China and abroad, gathering valuable literature from across the country and various countries. New items have been arriving recently, making it a feast for the eyes. The exhibits are divided into four categories: ① Books: including histories, catalogs, translations, periodicals, and rare books; ② Portraits: including portraits of famous doctors, medical illustrations, and charts; ③ Objects: including surgical instruments, acupuncture tools, internal medicine tools, pharmaceutical utensils, carvings, and sculptures; ④ Medical Customs: including medical and pharmaceutical deities, divine horses, elixirs, talismans, etc. Among them are many rare items, including dozens of major works by scholars from Germany, France, England, the United States, Japan, and other countries on the study of traditional Chinese medicine, all with summaries and explanations in Chinese. There is a French translation of the "Pulse Classic" from 1735 and translations of the "Compendium of Materia Medica" in various languages. A copy of the "Chinese Western Medical News," first published in 1882, was found in New York. The earliest Chinese medical journal, published in 1905, is also on display at the conference. Rare books include a rubbing of Sun Simiao's "Essential Formulas Worth a Thousand Gold," the "Xu Ke Medical Talks" manuscript treasured by Xiehe Medical College, and the original Ming Dynasty edition of "Comprehensive Medicine Through the Ages." Portraits of famous doctors include those of Fu Xi, Shen Nong, Hua Tuo, Zhang Zhongjing, Li Shizhen, Wang Dongchen, Huang Kuan, and foreign medical pioneers who came to China, such as Hepub, Jiayuehan, Gaolizhi, and Bojia, bringing together Chinese and Western medical sages in one hall, which is also a delightful event. Famous paintings include the "Acupuncture Illustration" by Li Tang of the Song Dynasty, from the collection of the Palace Museum, and the "Medical Ancestor Illustration" from the collection of the owner of Tianjin Darentang, which are not usually shown to the public lightly. There are also genuine prescriptions of Ye Tianshi, and exquisite ivory carvings of the Three Sovereigns, which are rare and valuable. As the conference is about to close, a special public exhibition will be held today from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM and tomorrow from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, welcoming people from all walks of life and the traditional Chinese medicine community to visit. The address is Songde Hall, National Shanghai Medical College, Fenglin Bridge.</p>
<h3>Central Committee Member Anqin Hutuktu Talks About Tibetan People Welcoming the Panchen Lama's Return to Tibet</h3>
<p>Also Welcoming People from Beijing and Shanghai to Invest in Developing the Border Regions</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Central Committee member Anqin Hutuktu, who was invited by Beijing lay Buddhists to preach the Dharma, arrived in Shanghai on the 5th with his entourage of 15 people by British ship, staying at the Dongya Hotel. A Central News Agency reporter visited him at his residence yesterday morning. According to him:</p>
<p>Welcoming the Panchen Lama's Return to Tibet: The current situation in Xizhi is very stable. The Tibetan people are warmly welcoming the Panchen Lama's return to Tibet, as the Panchen Lama is admired by the Tibetan people, and they deeply hope that he will return to Tibet soon to preside over everything. The Panchen Lama is currently on his way back to Tibet and is expected to arrive in Lhasa this summer. All three major monasteries in Tibet have sent representatives to welcome him. He went on to say that Tibet is an important border region, but due to inconvenient transportation, progress in various construction projects has been slow. The Tibetan people hope that people from Beijing and Shanghai will invest in developing the region.</p>
<p>Going to Beijing and Then to Peiping This Morning: I came here at the invitation of Beijing lay Buddhists to preach the Dharma, so I traveled to Shanghai as quickly as possible. I am scheduled to take the early express train to Beijing at 8:00 AM on the 7th to pay respects to the central authorities and the Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Wu Zhongxin, and report on the situation in Tibet. I do not plan to stay in Beijing for long and will immediately go to Peiping to preach the Dharma. I expect to stay in Peiping for a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>Visiting Zhu Qinglan and Others Separately: Anqin visited Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, and Wang Yiting of the Chinese Buddhist Association, and others by car yesterday morning around 10:00 AM. Xiong Yaowen and others, who were specially sent by the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission to Shanghai to welcome Anqin, hosted a banquet for Anqin and his entourage at the Dongya Hotel yesterday afternoon. The various Buddhist organizations in Shanghai held a joint banquet at the Gongdelin at 6:00 PM yesterday evening. Anqin had originally planned to preach the Dharma in Shanghai at the invitation of local Buddhist believers, but due to the urgency of going to Beijing and Peiping, it was decided that he would schedule it for when he returns from Peiping to the south.</p>
<h3>The Fisheries Syndicate Investigates the Fishing Situation in Wenzhou and Taizhou</h3>
<p>Paying Attention to Fish Markets and Cooperatives; Guiding Organization to Facilitate Loans</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Industrial Department's Fisheries Syndicate, several applications for loans have been received, but most of them are for loans secured by ocean-going vessels. According to the syndicate's loan regulations, loans to fishermen must be handled through cooperatives or fish markets. Currently, there are few cooperatives organized by fishermen in various places. The Industrial Department and the syndicate have jointly sent personnel to investigate the fishing situation in various places, paying particular attention to the organization of fish markets and cooperatives. The syndicate investigator, Hu Jinyuan, has already returned to Shanghai. According to him, this trip covered Yongjia, Ruian, Pingyang, and Yuhuan in Wenzhou Prefecture, and Linhai and Xiangshan in Taizhou Prefecture. The situation in each place is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Status of Cooperatives: Among the places visited on this trip, the Ningbo Dongqian Lake Cooperative is organized as a cooperative. It was established in July of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934). The members are based on fishing boats, including 56 pairs of large-scale boats, 11 ice-fresh boats, and 20 related individuals, totaling 87 members. They subscribed to 105 shares, each share worth 10 yuan. The cooperative has a basic structure, with a general office in Shenjiamen and branch offices in Ningbo and Shanghai. Its annual turnover reaches 200,000 yuan. Previously, due to the need for funds by its members, it borrowed 50,000 yuan from the syndicate's preparatory office to lend to the various fishing boats, making it the first to establish a relationship with the syndicate. In Shipu, there is the Dongmen Island Cooperative, established in November of last year, with 58 members who subscribed to 72 shares, each share worth 5 yuan. In other places, loans are mostly provided by fish markets, with the fish catch being sold to the lending fish market. Most do not charge interest, as they have a vested interest in doing so, which is different from the high-interest loans of fish markets in Shanghai and is worthy of attention. Of particular note is the Fishermen's Lending Office in Kanmen (Yuhuan). Initially, the district office borrowed 30,000 yuan from the Zhejiang Local Bank, which was transferred to the Fisheries Protection Office for lending, guaranteed by the fish markets, with an interest rate of 1.4%. This increased to 40,000 yuan in the 21st year of the Republic (1932) and to 60,000 yuan in the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), while the interest rate was reduced to 1.2%. Later, the management was transferred to the county magistrate, who organized a lending office with local gentry. On average, each boat could borrow about 800 yuan. Currently, the syndicate is in contact with Yang Kexun, a leader in the local fishing industry, and is planning to establish a cooperative.</p>
<p>Fishing Conditions in Various Places: The fishing conditions in various places are as follows: ① Yongjia: The distribution center for fish products from various counties in Wenzhou Prefecture, with an annual trade volume of about 1 million yuan. There are 20 fish markets, each with a capital of several thousand to 20,000-30,000 yuan, and an annual turnover ranging from several tens of thousands to over 300,000 yuan. There are different types of fishing boats, such as seine net boats, paired net boats, and fishing trawlers, totaling about 600 boats. The main fish catches are yellow croaker, ribbonfish, cuttlefish, large yellow croaker, eel, etc. Fish capital is provided by the various fish markets, with the three largest fish markets lending up to 100,000 yuan annually. ② Ruian: The fishing grounds are in Beiji, with 45 fish markets in the county, with a total capital of about 200,000 yuan and an annual turnover of about 1.1 million yuan. ③ Pingyang: The fishing grounds are in Aojiang, with 16 fish markets, with a total capital of about 50,000 yuan and an annual turnover of about 700,000 yuan. ④ Kanmen: One of the four major fish markets in Zhejiang, with over 130 local large-scale fishing boats. Each boat has an annual income of about 4,000 to 6,500 yuan. Last year's fishing season was very prosperous, and all were able to make a profit. The main fish catches are ribbonfish and eel. There are also over 100 fishing boats from Chongwu, Fujian, which also use Kanmen as their base, with a similar situation. Every year, they go to Shenjiamen in August and September, Shipu in October and November, and operate in the vicinity of Kanmen in December and January. In the spring, they catch sea eels. ⑤ Xiangshan: The fishing grounds are in Shipu. The main fish products are large and small yellow croaker, eel, bream, ribbonfish, and shark, with an annual production of about 40,000 dan, worth 300,000 yuan. There are 24 fish markets with a total capital of about 70,000 yuan and an annual turnover of about 100,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor Indicts Shen Junru and Others</h3>
<p>The case of Shen Junru and others endangering the Republic of China has been prosecuted by the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor. A public trial will be held in the coming days. The case is currently being handled by Fang Wen (Jiongfu), the presiding judge of the First Criminal Division of the High Court. The full text of the indictment is specially sought and published below:</p>
<p>Indictment</p>
<p>Indictment of the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor, Defendant Shen Junru, male, 64 years old, lawyer, residing at No. 91 Taoyuanfang, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai; Wang Zaoshi, male, 35 years old, lawyer, residing at No. 7, Yifeng Road B, Shanghai; Li Gongpu, male, 36 years old, principal of Liangcai Supplementary School, residing at No. 24 Hengchangli, Yuyuan Road, Shanghai; Sha Qianli, male, 35 years old, lawyer, residing at No. 4, Lane 524, Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai; Zhang Naiqi, male, 41 years old, university professor, residing at No. 24 Cihuicun, Terrasse Road, Shanghai; Zou Taofen, male, 42 years old, chief writer of Life Weekly, residing at No. 4, Lane 601, Route Lafayette, Shanghai; Shi Liang, female, 33 years old, lawyer, residing at No. 1 Lafayefang, Route Lafayette, Shanghai; Tao Xingzhi, male, details unknown; Luo Qing, male, 36 years old, currently unemployed, residing at No. 35 Huangzhou, Xuanwu Lake, Capital; Gu Liuxin, 29 years old, businessman, residing at No. 1528 Avenue Edward VII, Shanghai Public Concession; Ren Songgao (i.e., Ren Chonggao), male, 57 years old, primary school teacher, residing at Linqing School, Yangshupu, Shanghai; Zhang Zhongmian, male, details unknown; Chen Daohong, same as above; Chen Zhuo, same as above; The above-named defendants, due to the case No. 14 of 1936侦字 for endangering the Republic of China, has been concluded after investigation, and it is deemed that a public prosecution should be filed. The facts and evidence of the crime, as well as the applicable legal provisions, are described below:</p>
<p>Facts and Evidence of the Crime</p>
<p>Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, and the fugitive Tao Xingzhi, dissatisfied with the current government, advocated the slogan of the People's National Salvation Front in Shanghai, under the guise of uniting all parties and factions to resist the enemy and defend the country. First, they organized the National Salvation Associations of the cultural, professional, and women's circles. Later, they united the National Salvation Associations of university professors, students, workers, the National Crisis Education Society, and other organizations to form the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation United Association, and published publications to appeal to the public. Before long, they expanded the scope and organized a National All-Circles National Salvation United Association. On May 31, 1936, they held an inaugural meeting at the Shanghai Public Concession YMCA, and issued the "Declaration of the Inaugural Meeting of the National All-Circles National Salvation United Association" and the "Preliminary Political Program for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation." On July 15 of the same year, Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Tao Xingzhi, and Zou Taofen published a small pamphlet titled "Several Basic Conditions and Minimum Requirements for Unity and Resistance to Aggression," advocating stopping the civil war, releasing political prisoners, and negotiating peace with the Red Army to establish a unified anti-Japanese regime. At that time, Mao Zedong, a Communist Party member who had fled to the Northwest, saw the statements made by Shen Junru and others in the newspapers and wrote a letter in response, considering them to be of the same conviction. Shen Junru and others, receiving this response, felt that their wish had been fulfilled and further sought to expand their influence. They sent Luo Qing to organize the Jiangsu All-Circles National Salvation United Association. From then on, their actions became increasingly radical, and they published the National Salvation Information, criticizing the central government's policies and intentionally weakening the people's faith in the government. When labor unrest occurred in various Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, Shen Junru and others saw an opportunity and took this opportunity to organize a strike support association, collect funds, and provide assistance to the workers, intending to align them with the National Salvation Association. The former Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau sent personnel to cooperate with the Shanghai Public Concession and French Concession police to arrest Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, and Shi Liang. Except for Shi Liang, who absconded after being released on bail, Shen Junru and others were suspected of colluding with Communist Party members, organizing illegal organizations, inciting strikes and class boycotts, disrupting local order, and plotting to subvert the government. The evidence was transferred to the procuratorate for investigation. Later, the co-defendant Shi Liang also surrendered herself during the investigation. At the same time, Luo Qing was captured in Jiangyin County and sent by the Military Affairs Commission's Military Law Office for investigation. While the case was being handled, Gu Liuxin, Ren Songgao, Zhang Zhongmian, Chen Daohong, Chen Zhuo, and five others, in the name of representatives of the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation United Association, submitted a petition requesting the restoration of Shen Junru and others' freedom. Since Gu Liuxin et al. were all members of the Shanghai Professional Circles National Salvation Association, and Ren Songgao also served as a director of the association, there was a suspicion of being accomplices, and they were investigated together. Now, after investigation, it is clear that all the defendants in this case jointly committed the crime of organizing a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, and it is true that they propagated doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. The above-mentioned criminal facts are confirmed by the following evidence:</p>
<p>(1) The Declaration of the National All-Circles National Salvation United Association contains the errors of "the powers attacking the Soviet Union is a mistake, and China's suppression of the Communists is also a mistake," and "a few people with ulterior motives still believe that the Soviet Union and the Communist Party are the main enemies of the Chinese nation." In the National Salvation Information, similar arguments are numerous. It is well known that the Communist Party is a scourge to the country, and its tenets are clearly incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. The defendants organized groups and advocated that they should not be suppressed, and openly criticized the government's past suppression of the Communists as a mistake. Their intention to obstruct the central government's national policy of eradicating the Red disaster is extremely obvious.</p>
<p>(2) In addition to advocating the immediate release of political prisoners, the aforementioned declaration also stated, "All parties and factions should immediately send official representatives, and the People's National Salvation Front is willing to introduce negotiations in order to formulate a common program for resisting the enemy and establish a unified anti-Japanese regime." The Preliminary Political Program for Resisting Japan and Saving the Nation also contains the phrase "quickly establish a unified national salvation regime." It corresponds to the "Letter from the Communist Party to the Kuomintang" seized from Zhang Naiqi by Luo Qing, which states "We support the establishment of a unified democratic republic throughout China!" "Support the national unified defense government," and each section is like a rut. The defendants are all under the rule of the National Government. Shen Junru and Luo Qing also claimed to be "also members of the Kuomintang." Knowing that the Kuomintang is the only organization for the founding of the Republic of China, and the National Government is the only government of the Republic of China, they grouped it into the ranks of various parties and factions, recklessly advocated the People's National Salvation Front, claimed to be "willing to introduce negotiations," said "immediately release political prisoners," said "immediately send official representatives," and said "quickly establish a unified national salvation regime." The wording is absurd and reckless. It can be generally seen that they do not recognize the current government as having the power to rule, and want to organize another government outside the current government.</p>
<p>(3) The pamphlet "Several Basic Conditions and Minimum Requirements for Unity and Resistance to Aggression" published by Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Tao Xingzhi, and Zou Taofen contains "ceasefire and negotiate peace with the Red Army and jointly resist Japan" "The so-called parties and factions here naturally mainly refer to the Chinese Communist Party" "Now the Communist Party has put forward the proposition of uniting to resist Japan, but the Kuomintang has not expressed it. This result will make the general public believe that the Communist Party can take the overall situation into consideration and break the prejudice" Tao Xingzhi's thesis published in Life Magazine also clearly recognized "the Red Army is one of the three major groups in China." It can be seen that they intentionally advocated for the Communist Party and weakened the people's faith in the government and the Kuomintang. Moreover, after being questioned "The Communist Party is stateless and cosmopolitan, how can it save the country," according to Shen Junru's answer "We have not studied this issue" (Transcript of the interrogation on December 23, 1936). They were also questioned "When the Central Army participated in the war of January 28th and the Great Wall, the Red Army launched a rear attack at risk. How can they cooperate, and what method can be used to ensure that there will be no future troubles?" The defendants also failed to provide a sufficient answer to this question, only saying "After cooperation, if they dare to turn against us, it will not be difficult to use the power of the government and the people to sanction them," and according to Li Gongpu's statement "From what I have seen in books and newspapers, he (referring to the Communist Party, the same below) advocates resisting Japan, but whether he really has the determination to resist Japan is another question" (Transcript of the interrogation on the same date). Interacting and observing, it is not yet known whether the Communist Party has the determination to resist the enemy, but the defendants have grouped the Kuomintang and the government into the ranks of various parties and factions, and at the same time advocated "The so-called parties and factions naturally mainly refer to the Chinese Communist Party." Their contempt for the current government is undoubtedly a propaganda favorable to the Communist Party. (4) Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, Gu Liuxin, Ren Songgao, etc., although all claimed that "the People's National Salvation Front (also known as the National Front, the United Front, the National United Front, the National Salvation Front, the National Salvation Front, the United Front) they advocate is different from the People's Front slogan advocated by the Communist Party," and Zou Taofen presented his own Life Daily as proof, but according to the confession of co-defendant Luo Qing, "The terminology has not yet been unified, the People's Front, the People's National Salvation Front, the National Salvation Front, the United Front, the National Front, the United Front, are all the same" (Transcript of the interrogation on January 19, 1937). Even after reviewing Zou Taofen's Life Daily, it contains "For the sake of clarity, the term People's Front should no longer be used, and the National United Front should be used," which not only cannot prove that the People's National Salvation Front and the People's Front are two different things, but can prove that the People's Front slogan has long been used by the defendants. In addition, there is also the No. 1 Information of the Chinese Students National Salvation United Association seized at Zhang Naiqi's home, which contains the words "issue a declaration and raise funds to aid the Spanish People's Front government" "Welcome the representative of the American People's Front to Shanghai." It can be seen that the People's National Salvation Front and the People's Front are in fact the same term, and there is no doubt. Furthermore, it is confirmed that the Huohua Reading Club organized by Zhou Shouyi, Cheng Siwen, Gan Shuang, etc., whose purpose is to oppose capitalism, is indeed a Communist Party group, and has added people to the professional circles National Salvation Association and compiled them into group 1433, with Zhou Shouyi as the group leader, also after the Jiangsu High Court Second Branch, identified Zhou Shouyi et al. as a group organized for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, and the trial and punishment are on file. The professional circles National Salvation Association is a member of the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation United Association, the Shanghai All-Circles National Salvation United Association is a member of the National All-Circles National Salvation United Association, and it is the fact that the defendants unanimously acknowledge. It is clear that the Communist Party elements were included when the National Salvation Association was established. Furthermore, the People's Front is a Communist Party slogan, containing class action, party background, and the nature of internal revolution, which has not been denied by the defendants. The Spanish Civil War was started by the People's Front led by the Communist Party, which is also a significant event. The defendants insisted on using this slogan as a call to action, and their claim to unite various parties and factions has not yet been realized, and they first wanted to aid the People's Front government in Spain. On the one hand, they criticized our country's suppression of the Communists as a civil war, and on the other hand, they aided the civil war of the People's Front in other countries. Who can believe that there is no international background or political ambition? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Visit to Lun Chang Weaving and Dyeing Factory</h3>
<p>Mechanized Production, Scientific Management, 60,000 Spindles, Over 1,000 Looms</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) The Shanghai British Lun Chang Weaving and Dyeing Co., Ltd. has a factory located in Pudong with a grand scale. Its various weaving and dyeing equipment are equipped with the latest machinery, which is unparalleled in the Far East. The parent factory of the company is the Zhenhuan Weaving and Dyeing Company in Manchester, England, with a capital of up to 15.5 million pounds, formed by the merger of more than 40 companies. The capital allocated to Lun Chang is 1 million British pounds, equivalent to more than 16 million national currency dollars, and about 9 million dollars are used for machinery and equipment. At 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the company specially invited the local press to visit the factory in Pudong, and the details are recorded below:</p>
<p>New Factory in Lujiazui</p>
<p>The company is now divided into new and old factories. The new factory is the weaving part, located north of Lujiazui in Pudong, covering an area of more than 100 mu. It is divided into power, ginning, spinning, and weaving departments with approximately 60,000 spindles and 1,100 looms, and can produce more than 2,000 pieces of cloth per day. The old factory is located in Bailianjing, South Shanghai, and is the original bleaching, dyeing, and printing part. The total number of male and female workers in the entire factory reaches more than 1,000. At 10 o'clock yesterday morning, the company's special ship was waiting at the bronze statue pier at the intersection of Nanjing Road. Mr. Liu Jingfang, the Chinese director of the company, personally hosted the event. A total of 16 people, including Ma Yinliang, Wang Boqi, Wang Zhongwei, and Zeng Xubai, arrived.</p>
<p>Working in the Weaving Factory</p>
<p>At 10:15, the special ship arrived at the company's new factory in Pudong, and they visited the factory's work situation in turn. The first department was the power department, with three new automatic coal-fired boilers and one 4,000-kilowatt generator. The second department was the cotton cleaning department, equipped with four cotton cleaning machines and four cotton loosening machines, which use machines to remove cotton seeds and fluff the raw cotton to make cotton strips with a diameter of one inch, which are sent to the spinning department. The first department is spinning. The coarsely made cotton strips must go through the procedures of roving, two-ply yarn, fine yarn, and three times of hand processing to be spun into fine yarn. There is also a foreign thread machine, which specializes in making foreign thread. The fourth department is the weaving department, where the made fine yarn is transferred into warp yarn by the warp yarn machine, sent into the loom after sizing and threading, and then the weaving procedure is completed. According to the factory technician, the factory applies scientific management methods, all factory buildings have sanitary facilities, and workers are treated very well, so the work efficiency is higher than that of ordinary factories. Based on a yarn head, it takes only 36 hours from ginning to making cloth.</p>
<h3>Panorama of Lun Chang Dyeing Factory</h3>
<p>Visit to the Dyeing Factory</p>
<p>After the visit, Mr. Ashworth, the British factory manager, invited the reporters to have lunch in the factory's living room. At 1 p.m., they took a small boat to Bailianjing again to visit the company's bleaching, dyeing, and printing factory. They arrived at 1:40 p.m. The bleaching, dyeing, and printing factory is divided into four departments: power, pattern making, bleaching and dyeing, and printing. The first department is the generator, and the second department is the pattern making, which first draws patterns, enlarges them with a magnifying glass, makes rough samples, and then sends the rough samples to the engraving machine to use leverage to draw beautiful patterns on copper cylinders. The third department is bleaching and dyeing. The coarsely made cloth is sent into the oven, and after burning off the yarn hair, it is sent into the dyeing vat by machine. After adding bleaching powder for two hours, it is rolled out by machine, and after washing, polishing, and drying, it becomes bleached clean cloth. The fourth department is printing. The bleached cloth, or cloth that has been colored, is rolled into a wheel cylinder and sent to the printing machine to be printed with various colors and patterns. After fixing the color, drying, and polishing, it is made into brightly colored cloth. Finally, the procedures of attaching trademarks and coloring are completed before they are transported to the market for sale. It is said that the flower cloth produced by the factory is durable and never fades. In order to increase the credibility of its products to all sectors of society, the company has established a guarantee method, that is, all kinds of flower cloth with laundry picture insurance forms, if they fade within four months after purchase, can be exchanged at various sales outlets.</p>
<p>Reporter's Impressions: The visit was completed at 3 p.m., and they returned to Shanghai by the original ship. In addition to expressing considerable admiration for the greatness of the factory's machinery and equipment and the mechanization of production, the reporter's deepest feeling was the scientific management of the country, the emphasis on factory hygiene, and the increase in general wages, which made the efficiency of work reach the most satisfactory results. This point is definitely not superficial propaganda work, but requires hard work. In addition, there is one more thing worth our attention, that is, all the machinery used in the entire factory is British goods, even the small things like cigarettes and beer are made by British merchants, which proves the British people's sincere enthusiasm for protecting their own domestic goods. The domestic product production industry in our country has been vigorously promoted in recent years, and the entire development must depend on the purchase of each cell of the national people. At the same time, the development of domestic product factories must pay special attention to the efficiency of work. Then, the impression of the Lun Chang visit is a good reference for five people.

<h3>One Item of Regulations on Long-Distance Telephone Call Notification</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau received a letter from the Ministry of Communications on March 23, numbered Dianyezi 854, which stated, "After investigating domestic long-distance telephone calls, it is often the case that the recipient has already installed a telephone, but the caller is not yet aware of it and still sends a call notification. If the receiving bureau knows that the recipient has installed a telephone, it still sends a messenger to call the recipient to the bureau to answer the call, instead of directly calling and connecting by telephone, which is very inconvenient for the recipient. Also, if the recipient's residence has a telephone nearby that can be borrowed to receive a long-distance telephone call, they should be allowed to apply to the telephone bureau to accommodate the borrowing of the telephone for convenience. Now, in order to facilitate the public and promote business, two regulations are stipulated as follows: (1) When the caller requests a long-distance telephone call, if the receiving bureau knows that the recipient has a telephone, there is no need to send a messenger to call. First directly call the telephone installed by the recipient. After the recipient is called and connected, change to calling for a conversation. However, if the telephone installed by the recipient cannot be called, send a messenger to call and handle it as a call notification. (2) When the caller requests a call notification and the receiving bureau does not know that the recipient has installed a telephone, or knows that the recipient has installed a telephone but cannot call it and still sends a messenger to call, and the recipient's residence has a telephone nearby that can be borrowed to receive the long-distance telephone call, the recipient should write down the notification number and the caller's location on the notification slip when they receive it, and write down the telephone number of the installed telephone or the borrowed telephone on the back of the notification slip and apply to the telephone bureau to connect the long-distance call to the telephone of that number. For example, "Please connect to telephone number so-and-so" and other words. Return the notification slip to the original messenger to take back to the telephone bureau, and immediately go to the location where the telephone of that number is installed, and report to the long-distance station of the telephone bureau by telephone: (1) notification slip number (2) caller's location (3) name of the person (4) telephone number of the telephone used, and request the telephone bureau to connect the long-distance call to the telephone of that number. After the telephone bureau verifies the accuracy of items (1), (2), and (3), the connection will be made to speed up the communication. The above regulations should be implemented from May 1 of this year.</p>
<h3>Severe Drought in Sichuan Province, Zhu Qinglan to Enter Sichuan</h3>
<p>Baker Enters Sichuan First to Survey the Disaster</p>
<p>There has been no rain in Sichuan in August, and the drought is becoming more and more serious. The disaster area reaches more than 110 counties. The grass roots and tree bark have been completely eaten. The famine victims have to dig and eat white mud, and those who die from intestinal obstruction are countless. According to the investigation in Chongqing alone, the number of people who starved to death and died from eating white mud has reached tens of thousands. The disaster is so terrible. The Sichuan fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai and the Sichuan Business Welfare Association here have jointly established the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association last month, calling for petitions in separate ways. Representatives are constantly traveling between Beijing and Shanghai. It is now known that the association also hosted Zhu Qinglan, Chairman of the National Relief Committee, Baker J.E.B-aker, General Manager of the Chinese and Foreign Charity Relief Association, and Rui Pu C.B.Sape, Vice Chairman of the Chongqing Branch, at Gongdelin at 6 p.m. on the 4th. Committee members Zhang Shulin, Zheng Bicheng, Yu Jitang, Fan Zhongqu, Mei Xinru, Zheng Yushu, and Li Xunfu attended. The discussion on the issue of Sichuan disaster relief was quite detailed. Zhu Qinglan also said that relief cannot be delayed and plans to personally bring funds into Sichuan to distribute relief soon. Baker and Rui Pu are scheduled to fly to Sichuan on the China Airlines flight on the 9th to survey the disaster situation.</p>
<h3>Doctor Tang Ruta Returns to China</h3>

<h3>Customs Anti-Smuggling Personnel Seize Another Large Batch of Copper Coins Yesterday</h3>
<p>Approximately 100,000 Coins Worth 400 Yuan</p>
<p>Shenzhou News Agency reported that on the Japanese wheel Maya Maru of the Japanese Mailboat Company, which was berthed, at midnight the day before yesterday, another 50 vagrants, wearing specially made thick cloth vests, secretly transported copper coins until about 2 o'clock. The Customs had received a secret report at the time, but in order to prevent accidents, they did not send personnel to intercept them. After the vagrants finished loading, they all left the wheel, leaving only a few people to guard. At 4 o'clock yesterday morning, the Customs sent Chief Huang Xinqiang of the inspection and seizure team to lead all the members of Group A to board the wheel and implement the seizure. They seized more than 100,000 copper coins (worth approximately 400 yuan) and nine vests for smuggling on the wheel. They were loaded into burlap bags and safely transported into the Customs by car and confiscated entirely. This is the second major harvest of the Customs anti-smuggling personnel since the 26th of last month.</p>

<h3>Accusations of Inducing Gambling, Intimidation, and Robbery of Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Wu Changsan Arrested; Accomplices Not Yet Apprehended</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen Gu, Mrs. Jiang Wang, and Mrs. Shen Jin, women from Ningbo residing at No. 3 Zhoujiazui Road and No. 5 Zhaofeng Road, at 5:15 PM on the 27th of last month, near a fenced bungalow near Baoding Road, Zhoujiazui Road, accused Wu Changsan of Jiangyin of inducing them to gamble, and gathered a gang to use</p>
<p>Axes to Intimidate, robbing them of 35 yuan in legal tender. Officer Wu from No. 901 and No. 247 of the Sino-Western Police arrested the accused, along with two axes and a deck of playing cards found on the ground, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo visited the Third Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated that the trial should be postponed because the accomplices</p>
<p>Have Not Been Apprehended. However, according to Xipu of No. 47, who was with Officer Wu of No. 901 when the defendant was arrested, he saw the three plaintiffs and the defendant walking together, without anyone else. When asked in court, the Xipu officer said that it was dark at the time, and he used a flashlight to look, and only saw the four plaintiffs and defendants</p>
<p>Walking Outside the Fence, from east to west. After hearing shouts, Officer Wu of No. 901 arrested the defendant. The defendant Wu Changsan stated that Chen Gu's real name was Jin Di. Since last month, he often went to her house to gamble. She was the owner. Because he always lost money when gambling with friends, he stopped going and went to the gambling table in the fenced</p>
<p>Bungalow on Baoding Road. At this time, the plaintiff Jin Di invited more than 20 people to come, dragged him out and beat him, and then accused him of robbery, calling the police to arrest him. The two axes were abandoned by other people. He also hired Attorney Ma Lewu to defend him. Both sides held their own views. Judge Dai ordered that the defendant be returned to custody and the trial be postponed to investigate and verify the facts.</p>
<h3>Group Wedding Held Today</h3>

Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, a rehearsal was held in the Municipal Government Auditorium, with Director Zhang Binghui of the Fourth Section of the Social Affairs Bureau guiding everything.</p>
<h3>Small Pawnshops Deceived into Pledging Artificial Jade Jewelry</h3>
<p>Green Changes to Yellow-Green; Found to be Fake When the Term Expires</p>
<p>Shanghai is a mixed place, with good and bad people mixed together. Various scams emerge one after another. A few years ago, fake pearls were discovered, and small pawnshops and pledges, etc., did not notice it for a while, and pledged a lot. Only after the term expired and they could not be redeemed did they realize they were fake. It is heard that recently there have been newly made bright and lovely jadeite found. The counterfeiters make them into watch pendants and jade bracelets, etc., using white jade to fry them, and the green color is very good. They take them to pawnshops and pledge shops. Each watch pendant can be pledged for more than 30 yuan, and jade bracelets can be pledged for one or two hundred yuan. After a certain pawnshop pledged this kind of fake item, they took it out to look at it after two months. Unexpectedly, the green color changed to yellow-green, and they realized it was artificial jadeite, and the deceived family had lost a lot of money.</p>
<h3>Wet Nurse Accuses Master of Abandonment</h3>
<p>Demands More Than 9,000 Gold Yuan in Living Expenses</p>
<p>Gu Baolin, a wealthy local man at No. 69 Xilong, Haichao Temple Road, Nanshi, is 66 years old. Gu Pan, an old woman from Tongzhou living at No. 3, Lane 14, Xiaoputuo Bridge, is 53 years old. Twenty years ago, she was a wet nurse in Gu's family and had a love affair with the master. Last winter, Gu was ill, and Gu Pan, thinking of her old love, brought fruit and snacks to visit him. Unexpectedly, she was rejected by Gu's wife, and they had a big fight. The two old women even had a lawsuit for injury. After the case was closed, Gu did not dare to go to Pan's place to reminisce about their love. The woman hired Attorney Fang Gang to sue Gu Baolin in the local court for abandonment and alimony. The general idea of her complaint was that she was seduced by Gu's sweet words in the fifth year of the Republic of China and had an affair with him, renting a house to live together for more than 20 years. Their relationship was very good, and they each had a child, a son named Heng Hu and a daughter named Yu Ying, who are now studying at Xunyu School. The expenses for raising them have always been borne by Gu, but since last year, he suddenly changed his attitude, disappeared without a trace, and refused to visit. The necessities of life were not given to him. She was once chased for rent, rice and firewood were exhausted, and tuition was not available. They were crying for food and surrounded by enemies. She asked the case to take money, but was falsely accused by the elder wife Xia. Fortunately, she was wise and advised to withdraw. The mother and daughter had no way to make a living. The defendant possessed more than 100,000 yuan in wealth, but now he abandoned them in the end. Therefore, she asked to be given 9,540 yuan for living expenses. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Shao opened the court. The defendant did not arrive, and was represented by Attorney Xu Xingti, who said that Pan was a wet nurse 20 years ago and often borrowed money without success, so she made up a false accusation. Moreover, the woman has a husband, so how can these children be said to be the defendant's offspring? The court ordered a postponement for investigation and further questioning.</p>
<h3>Silk Weavers Petitioned Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Yang Qingchang's Check Lawsuit Hearing</h3>
<p>The Check is to be Used for Debt Repayment; Wait for Yang Shande to Arrive in Court for Further Questioning</p>
<p>Yang Qingchang, the youngest son of the late former Zhejiang Military Governor Yang Shande, is romantic and unrestrained, and often lingers in dance halls. Recently, he had a physical relationship with a dancer in a certain dance hall, and his wife Zheng Fengying sued him in the Second Special District Local Court for adultery, and was fined. Before this case occurred, Qingchang had a check for 13,000 yuan in legal tender from the Industrial Bank of China, which was taken away by his wife, and he</p>
<p>Reported the Loss to the Bank. On the one hand, he hired Attorney Jiang Baoli to submit a request to the First Special District Local Court to declare the check invalid. Later, because Zheng Fengying came forward to claim rights, the court ordered the Industrial Bank of China to pay all the check money to the court for safekeeping. Zheng Fengying also formally filed a lawsuit against her husband Yang Qingchang to confirm that the check belonged to her.</p>
<p>Everything That She Possesses. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji opened the court for a hearing. The defendant claimed to be ill and did not arrive, and Jiang Pingfan appeared in court on his behalf. Because the matter belonged to a dispute between husband and wife, and someone was mediating, he requested a postponement. However, the plaintiff Zheng Fengying expressed her opposition and explained the reason for obtaining the check. It is said that her husband Yang Qingchang spent extravagantly outside and had an affair with a dancer. Although she</p>
<p>Advised Him to Return Home and Write a Letter of Repentance, he never repented. Last year, he lent her money in six installments. On January 4 this year, she went to the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. with him, and the defendant personally paid the check as repayment of the debt owed. He did not rob her, and could summon the staff of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. to testify, etc. The plaintiff's lawyer then stated the intention of the lawsuit. The defendant's lawyer then stated that the check was indeed robbed by the plaintiff and denied that the defendant had</p>
<p>Owed His Wife Money. The plaintiff said that because she knew that the defendant was going to Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. that day to get the check, she invited her father and others to go with the defendant. When she saw the defendant's check, she grabbed a piece of paper and returned. The defendant did not report it to the police because of the relationship between husband and wife. Judge Xu said that the defendant must come to court in person to understand the case, so he ordered that Yang Qingchang be summoned to court again on the 14th of this month for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Regret of a Lost Girl in the Peach Blossom River Dance Hall</h3>
<p>Mo Jinsong Never Returned; Filed a Complaint with the Court for Obstructing Morality</p>
<p>Wu Xu, a local woman, instructed her 14-year-old daughter Mei Xiu to go out to learn to dance because her husband died early and her family was poor. After she became skilled, she danced in the Peach Blossom River Dance Hall in Taichang Building, Zhejiang Road, for several months. In February of this year, Mo Jinsong, a young master of the Mo Ma Oil Drum Shop at No. 339 Park Road, was only 19 years old, registered as Ningbo and lived at No. 23, Lane 45, Qingdao Road. He was young and handsome and liked to</p>
<p>Set Foot in Dance Halls. Because he went to the Peach Blossom River to dance with his friend Wang Deshan, he met Wu Mei Xiu. From then on, Mo Jinsong often used dancing as an excuse to seduce Wu. Wu was young and shallow, and her knowledge was weak, so she was deceived by him. On the night of February 27, Mo Jinsong went to the Peach Blossom River again with Wang Deshan. They each danced with their lovers. Before long, Mo and others proposed to go to other places to dance. Mo then danced with Wu Mei Xiu, and Wang Deshan also went out with his dancer Zhang Ying</p>
<p>Together. They first went to the Dadong Dance Hall and danced wildly until midnight, and then went to the Jinxingkang Hotel on Zhejiang Road for a feast, and then went to Room 7 of the Hongkou Grand Hotel on North Sichuan Road. It was already 5:00 AM the next morning. That morning, Wu's virginity was broken, and her flaw became apparent. However, after returning home, she did not dare to tell her mother the truth, and hoped that she could make a marriage with Mo in the future.</p>
<p>Live Together Forever. Unexpectedly, the infatuated woman met a heartless man. After Mo Jinsong achieved his goal, he disappeared without a trace. She waited for more than a month, but could not see him. She complained and became ill. Her mother Wu Xu saw that her daughter was different, and after strict questioning, she learned everything. She then hired Attorney Chen Maoxuan to send a letter to Mo for negotiation, but he only agreed to give her 200 yuan for medical expenses. The woman did not agree, so she reported to the Xinzha Police Station, which ordered Detective Weng Peiyu to</p>
<p>Investigate the Facts. She filed a lawsuit according to law. Yesterday morning, when Judge Huang of the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court rose to hear the case, the defendant Mo Jinsong refused to appear, and the victims Wu Xu and her daughter were also unable to appear in court due to illness. They still commissioned Attorney Chen to come to court and requested a postponement. Then, Attorney Li Zhishan of the Police Station stated the case and filed a lawsuit according to Article 221, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for obstructing morality. Since the defendant did not appear today, he requested a postponement and further summons. The court ruled that the case would be postponed until the 10th of this month for further summons of the defendant for questioning.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Killed by Train on Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway</h3>
<p>Ding A Yuan's Right Hand Severed</p>
<p>Near the 24-kilometer track between the Meilong and Xinzhuang stations on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, at about 7:00 AM yesterday, the body of a boy about ten years old who had been killed by an unknown train the night before was found, as well as a boy of the same age with a crushed head and a severed right hand, lying painfully beside the body. After the railway staff found it, they immediately reported it to the nearby Meilong stationmaster and ordered the</p>
<p>Officials to rush to take care of and rescue them. First, the injured person was loaded onto the 81st Jiahu District train from Jiaxing to Shanghai at 7:25 AM, and sent to the railway hospital branch at the station for first aid and dressing, and then transferred to the Beizhan Lianglu General Hospital for treatment. According to the injured boy, his name was Ding A Yuan, 15 years old, from Shaoxing, and he was an apprentice at a coppersmith in Shanghai. Because he could not bear the hardship, he and his fellow apprentice, the deceased (14 years old), escaped together, and took a train from Shanghai the night before to return to their hometown. However, they got off the train midway and walked along the railway. Unfortunately, his companion was crushed to death when the train passed by. Because he tried to rescue him at the time, his right hand was also crushed by the locomotive, and his head was slightly injured. As for other circumstances, as well as the name of the deceased, he firmly refused to tell the truth. The investigation is being carried out by the railway</p>
<h3>Sun Changfa Swore and Cried in Court</h3>
<p>Li Xu Sues for Theft; Witnesses Unfavorable to the Defendant</p>
<p>Sun Changfa, a Ningbo man who lived at No. 44 Ziyou Street, Yidingpan Road, and was formerly a chef for Westerners, was taken into custody by the police and prosecuted by the court because he was accused by his cohabiting woman Li Xu of stealing 20 yuan in banknotes and four pawn tickets. Yesterday, Judge Wu opened the court. Li Xu said that on the third day of last month, she went to her sister's place to stay for one night, and when she came back the next day, the banknotes and pawn tickets in the drawer were all gone. The defendant also admitted compensation and asked his brother-in-law Cao Afu and my sister Jiang Mulan to be guarantors. At this point, Sun Changfa said that the plaintiff was someone else's concubine. Because she had a quarrel with the elder wife, she lived with me for one day in March. The plaintiff and his wife quarreled, and her husband ran out naked. I scolded them, so they came to frame me. At this point, Cao Afu and others all gave unfavorable testimony to Sun Changfa in court. Then, Sun Changfa cried loudly in court and swore that if the plaintiff took an oath, even if I was sentenced to ten years, I would be willing, and said to his wife, I want to be dragged to jail, I want you to redress my grievances. The official then declared the debate over and scheduled the judgment.</p>
<h3>Method for Preventing and Controlling Silkworm Diseases Invented by the Central Agricultural Experiment Station</h3>
<p>Compiled into a Booklet for Adoption</p>
<p>Shen Shi She Yun, the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry, after many studies and experiments on the methods of preventing and controlling silkworm diseases, has achieved effective results. Therefore, it has compiled a book and distributed it to the silkworm mulberry improvement areas in various provinces, cities, and counties for application, so as to guide farmers in prevention and control. The letter said, checking that sericulture by farmers is an important sideline business in my country for thousands of years, and the produced silk has a wide range of uses. Silk exports also occupy an important position. Sericulture is very important to the national economy and people's livelihood. However, during the silkworm rearing period, multiple-faceted silkworm maggot diseases and white stiff diseases often occur. Once the silkworms are infected, they will be discarded and nothing will be harvested. The losses suffered by sericulture families are very huge. In view of this, our institute has sent personnel to conduct in-depth research on the prevention and control methods of these two diseases, and has spent several years to invent the maggot washing method and the manufacturing of anti-stiff method. The prevention and removal of multi-faceted silkworm maggots and white stiff diseases has been repeatedly tested and has quite effective effects. Moreover, although the application of bleaching disinfection can prevent and remove silkworm diseases, improper preparation will be harmful to the silkworm body. Our institute has also studied the problem of rationalizing the application of bleaching to prevent and control silkworm diseases, and has invented a rationalized solution preparation method for application, and has produced a simple bleach measuring instrument. Now, in order to make the sericulture industry understand the truth of the above-mentioned methods, so that they can be universally adopted, we have specially compiled the latest prevention and control methods for silkworm maggot diseases, and two books on rationalizing the application of bleaching for anti-stiff and disease silkworm prevention and control, in order to spread and publish the books. The corresponding books are sent together with forty copies of each of the above-mentioned books for you to forward, and please instruct your subordinates to guide and benefit sericulture production.</p>
<h3>Human Rickshaw Association Statistics for Citywide Rickshaw Pullers</h3>
<p>The Human Rickshaw Association of the Special Zone, because there were too many vacancies for rickshaw pullers, requested the Public Works Bureau to conduct a supplementary registration. The registration has ended since the bureau started registering on the 10th of last month. A total of more than 2,000 people have registered. The association Fang Hui believes that among the 41,500 registered rickshaw pullers, those who have returned to their hometowns and those who are registered in name account for half, which makes it impossible for fellow vehicles to be rented out, which greatly affects business. A survey of the total number of rickshaw pullers was held, and the rickshaw owners submitted them to the association for statistics. Once the statistics are completed, they will be reported to the Public Works Bureau for supplementation according to the facts. For rickshaw pullers who have a license but do not pull rickshaws, they will request that their licenses be cancelled so that they can be supplemented as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Two Dismissed Police Officers Deceived with Fake Gold Bangles</h3>
<p>Difficult to Distinguish Under the Lights; Many Pawnshops Were Deceived</p>
<p>Zhang Qingshan, a Henan native and police officer No. 3530 of the Third Section of the Fifth District of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and Wu Baohua, an Anhui native and police officer No. 3020, were dismissed last year for bad conduct. After Zhang and Wu lost their jobs, they had difficulty making a living, so they came up with a strange idea and jointly went to Tianjin to purchase 52 fake gold bangles and brought them to Shanghai. Each of these gold bangles weighed about three qian. The surface of the bangles was 18K gold skin, coated with gold water, and the inside was a nickel base. The trademarks of various silver shops were forged. At first glance, it was difficult to distinguish the authenticity. The value of each was about 2 yuan. Zhang and Wu used these fake bangles to pledge to pawnshops in Hongkou, and the pledging time was always at night. Under the lights, it was even more difficult to identify. The pledged price was about 20 to 30 yuan per bangle. Many pawnshops were deceived. Zhang and others had successively pledged 50 of the fake bangles brought from Tianjin to Shanghai, and made a lot of money. At 8:30 PM the night before, Zhang took the only two remaining fake bangles and asked Feng Pawnshop at No. 212 Wuzhou Road to pledge them for 40 yuan. The pawnshop clerk had been notified by his peers, so he paid special attention and immediately found out that they were fake. So he detained Zhang and sent him to the Jiaxing Road Police Station. After questioning by Detective Yao Yuanlong and detectives Chen Ruisheng and Cao Jinbiao, Zhang confessed everything. Then the detectives and the detectives of the Municipal Police Bureau arrested Wu Baohua at No. 18 Taihangli, Qingji Road, and took him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police station's attorney Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for attempted fraud under Article 339, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, and said that the pawns had previously been pledged to He's pawnshop, which still needed to be investigated, so he requested permission to postpone the trial. After questioning by Judge Meng Tingke, he ordered that the trial be postponed for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Fake Banknote Exhibition</h3>
<p>Held for Two Weeks Starting Today</p>
<p>The harm of fake banknotes to society is well known, especially to the common people, who may occasionally be deceived and a tragedy may occur. Mr. Yuan Dechang of this city, who has been in the banking industry for many years, hates the harm of fake banknotes to the people. He is uniquely able to pay attention to searching for them on weekdays, thinking of how to enlighten the public and eradicate crime. After exhausting his efforts and tasting ridicule and contempt, he collected hundreds of fake banknotes and obtained the permission of the Municipal People's Education Museum to cooperate. Starting today, the exhibition will be held at the Consumer Cooperative of the museum on Wenmiao Road for two weeks. Mr. Yuan's sincerity in the people's welfare is truly rare. It is thought that there is no lack of people in Shanghai who care about this public welfare matter, and they should be able to participate enthusiastically and support it, so that Mr. Yuan will have more fake banknotes in the future to show to the public.</p>

A Wang surname officer from the Central Military Academy, dressed in plain clothes, sternly ordered Xu and Gan to quickly direct ticket buyers to maintain order at the entrance and exit. Xu and Gan, seeing that Mr. Wang was in plain clothes and not knowing which department he was from, replied that they were Nanshi police officers, escorting a friend and could not overstep their jurisdiction. They added that the station had railway police and officers from the Fifth District Sub-bureau, and they should not interfere. Unexpectedly, Mr. Wang argued that as they were in uniform, their directions would be more effective than someone not in uniform, and they should obey his orders. He considered their refusal to be insubordination and ordered the two officers to go to reason with him. As they walked out of the station, Inspector-General Wang Dasui happened to be at the station. Mr. Wang complained to Inspector-General Wang about the officers' unreasonableness.

Zhang reported to the police, and Cui Guangshan and Bian Xiaomazi were arrested and sent to court one after another and convicted. Now suddenly, Huang Li Clan, the wife of Huang Mazi, one of the robbers in the case, filed a complaint with the local court, accusing the municipal police detective Yuan Weishu, who was in charge of the case, of illegal imprisonment. The court hearing took place yesterday. Huang said, "My husband returned to his hometown in January. On March 12, detective Yuan Weishu suddenly took me to a three-story building in someone else’s house, locked me up, and extorted money from me for five or six hours before releasing me. When I returned home, my child was missing. Therefore, I am seeking justice." Yuan Weishu said in his defense, "I live at No. 26 Xin Taiping Lane. On the afternoon of March 7, for the theft case, I took the plaintiff Zhang Senyu and went to the police station to arrest Cui Guangshan, while Huang Mazi and others fled.

<h3>"On Military-National Parents" Has Been Published</h3>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association, in order to promote parental education and protect children's development, has specially published the book "On Military-National Parents" to be contributed to parents and educators throughout the country. The book is a new work by Chen Zhengfan, director of the Education Department of the Child Welfare Association, with prefaces by Xu Jianping and Chen Tiesheng (price per copy is 50 cents). Based on historical evidence and world observations, the author advocates a military-nationalism that emphasizes both civil and military aspects. He advocates that parents throughout the country transform into military-national parents, overthrowing the concept of private children and the supremacy of filial piety. Based on the principle of civil and military integration, children should be educated, and a doctrine of service first should replace the old doctrine of filial piety. The author uses diagrams to illustrate his ideas, and many new ideas have been created that others have not mentioned. The examples of famous military-national parents are all commendable and touching. The book includes reference documents for military-national parents, such as Letters from the Military to Their Sons, Songs for Sending Off Sons, Letters from Prison from Mothers, Letters from Fathers Before Going to War, and Devotion to the Country and Missing Relatives, which are especially valuable historical works. Those who sincerely love children and care about the future of the country should not miss this book. It can be purchased at the association at No. 131 Museum Road, Shanghai.</p>
