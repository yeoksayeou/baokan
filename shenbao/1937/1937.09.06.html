<h3>敵增援兩師團到滬我士氣旺盛凖備大戰</h3>
<p>敵圖偷襲獅子林我將予痛勦　羅店我軍已收復滬汽車站　敵機昨飛滬西轟炸慘殺平民</p>
<p>截至今晨四時止、各路戰况概述如下、㊀敵大批援軍到滬、分駐楊樹浦·張華浜·吳淞等處、日內將大擧進犯、我軍士氣旺盛、嚴陣以待、屆時决予以嚴重打擊、㊁一部份增援敵軍、由敵艦運輸、集中獅子林方面、有大擧偷襲登陸模樣、我已有充分準備、敵來必令其無一生還、㊂羅店方面殘敵、仍在我軍包圍中、我軍現進展至羅店滬太長途汽車站、乘勝克復羅店東北兩面之村落共達六處、㊃楊樹浦江灣一帶、昨晚雙方除劇烈砲戰外、並無大接觸、我軍陣線不動㊄閘北方面、敵深晚數度以小部隊向我陣地衝擊、一時小鋼砲機關槍聲密集、迨我軍躍出戰壕追逐、則又迅速遁去、目的全在騷擾、無關戰局、我軍沉着予以掃蕩驅逐、敵終不得逞、</p>
<p>今晨二時半、浦江敵艦、頻頻發斷續不息之砲、向我閘北江灣一帶之陣地轟擊砲聲之中、雜有時作時息之機槍聲、似在向我陣地作試探戰、我軍沉着應付、不為所亂、至今晨三時、炮聲漸滅、機槍之聲亦息、但敵艦之探照燈、仍在向四空照射、防我空軍進襲、</p>
<h3>寶山城昨被敵淪陷</h3>
<p>中央社云、敵軍在吳淞鎮登陸後、曾經我軍壓迫、追至江邊、自三日夜間起、敵屢次增援、一再向我進犯、雙方屢進屢退、激戰至烈、至四日夜間、一部敵軍、復由砲臺灣登陸、向寶山疾進侵犯、我軍奮勇迎擊、血戰通宵、敵軍創傷甚巨、至昨日下午、敵又大批增援、傾全力來犯、我軍抵抗、至為激烈、惟以敵艦及飛機猛烈轟炸、傷亡頗重、餘部不得已退入寶山城內、敵軍復以重砲及飛機向城內猛烈轟擊、我軍壯烈犧牲、居民亦大受塗炭、該城遂淪陷敵軍之手、現我獅子林至月浦鎭之綫、仍由重兵扼守、敵軍企圖與羅店區殘敵溝通、决難如願、</p>
<h3>大敵援軍兩師團已到滬</h3>
<p>昨已在吳淞各處登陸　楊樹浦方面為數亦衆</p>
<p>中央社、前日抵達淞口之敵艦、共四十九艘、內載有敵新開來滬之援軍兩師團及大批軍需彈藥、該批援軍及彈藥之一部、已於前日午夜由敵運輸艦五艘商輪二艘、及驅逐艦二艘、分別載入浦江、該運輸艦五艘、三艘停靠楊樹浦碼頭、二艘停靠招商局北棧、商輪二艘、一艘停靠黃浦碼頭、一艘停靠大阪碼頭、驅逐艦二艘、則停靠招商局北棧、該批一部分援軍及彈械、卽紛紛在上列各碼頭登陸及起卸、楊樹浦碼頭（上海電力公司附近）並有敵軍大量重兵器起卸上岸、</p>
<p>（本報特訊）敵軍節節敗退後、又向東京乞援、前日有大批敵艦、共計四十餘艘、係商船與運輸艦、混合組成、集結吳淞口外、計共運來二師團援軍、大部份援軍昨晨已在吳淞登陸、聞卽於日內下全綫總攻擊令、企圖突出重圍、我軍正嚴陣以待、届時决予以迎頭痛擊、</p>
<p>敵軍增援部隊兩師團、駛抵淞口後、因聞岸上各綫、均吿失敗、急待援救、故於昨日上午十時、一部份敵軍、約兩團之衆、集大砲掩護之下、在張華浜敵方所建之臨時碼頭登陸、午後卽與吳淞鎭殘敵會合、</p>
<p>據來自虹口區之西人方面消息、昨前兩日、日軍結集於楊樹浦一帶者、為數極衆、自楊樹浦大連郵船會社碼頭登陸之援軍、如潮擁上、步兵之外、尚有不少坦克車及重砲等卸下、飛機運岸裝配者、其數亦甚多、據西人方面之觀察、楊樹浦方面、敵軍似乎有所企圖、恐一俟登陸援軍分配完竣之徒、楊樹浦一帶、敵軍將開始作大規模之攻擊云、</p>
<p>字林報云、昨（四日）悉虹口匯山區內之日軍、連日甚形活動、狀似凖備對華軍陣綫取攻勢、除調出十八磅重之砲四中隊、坦克車若干輛外、步兵入該區者為數甚衆、同時楊樹浦大連郵船會社碼頭有多數軍用飛機運至岸上、以供在上海區域作戰之用、諸機皆用油布包沒、僅露其尾、故不能知為何式、</p>
<h3>昨日敵艦調動繁忙</h3>
<p>駛滬各敵艦、調遣之繁忙、以昨日為最、蓋自敵寇滬三星期來、雖迭在我沿江沿海各口岸全圖登陸、皆遭我軍猛烈之抵抗、終未得逞、故敵於萬不獲意中、於前日又駛來運輸艦四十九艘、滿載敵軍、冀圖增援在滬已被我軍擊潰之部隊、昨日卽為該批援軍調遣之期、故昨日浦中敵艦之往來所以特趨頻繁者、並非無因也、計自昨晨黎明起、卽有敵運輸艦及驅遂艦各一艘開進、第廿一隊驅逐艦一艘開出、旋該驅逐艦於九時三該復開進、十一時半又開出、九時五十分又有敵運輸艦一艘駛入、十一時敵第廿三隊驅逐艦一艘駛入、十二時半又駛出、（同時駛出者尚有十六隊驅逐艦一艘）一時一刻敵輪Tangyang丸駛入、四時廿五分駛出、二時半及三時半先前駛入之敵運輸艦二艘復相繼駛出、四時第廿一隊驅逐艦及運輸艦各一艘駛入、四時半及五時、第一隊驅逐艦二艘及砲艦一艘又開到、綜計敵艦昨日進出凡廿餘次、其調遣援軍及補充軍需之繁忙、由此可見一斑、記者昨日下午五時赴浦靣調査、悉各敵艦之停泊、浦中者尚有廿一艘、其停泊情形如下、計卅五號及廿三號浮筒砲艦各一艘、十五號浮筒驅逐艦砲艦各一艘、十四號浮筒驅逐艦一艘、十一號浮筒砲艦一艘、十號七號浮筒驅逐艦各一艘、二號浮筒出雲艦一艘、三菱碼頭驅逐艦三艘、（第廿三隊廿一隊十六隊各一）招商局北棧運輸艦驅逐艦各二艘、日本郵船碼頭第一隊驅逐艦二艘、新三井碼頭砲艦一艘、黃浦碼頭及大阪碼頭商輪改運輸艦各一艘、共爲廿一艘、</p>
<h3>敵軍謀偷襲獅子林</h3>
<p>中央社、自敵軍増援張華浜及薀藻浜之綫並在吳淞强渡登陸之後、猛力向獅子林方面突進、以期與羅店方面之敵取得聯絡、奈我獅子林方面之兵力雄厚、予敵迎頭痛擊、敵計迄未得逞、於是敵軍乃變更計劃、企圖在獅子林方面偷渡登陸、自上星期四起、卽有敵艦四艘、數度來犯、企圖登陸、均經我軍以密集之機槍掃射、敵艦不逞而退、茲悉敵軍强奪我民船多艘、昨日集中於獅子林江面、似有大擧偷襲登陸之模樣、我軍刻已嚴密戒備、準備予敵重創、</p>
<h3>吳淞口形勢圖</h3>
<h3>我克復羅店汽車站</h3>
<p>中央社、羅店方面之敵、自經我軍截斷其小川沙一帶之後路、業已完成四面包圍之形勢後、昨日二十四小時之內、最重要之發展、卽為我軍在激戰之後、克復羅店長途汽車站、緣我軍前夜藉砲火之掩護、逼近敵軍、短兵接戰、我軍除以手溜彈襲擊外、僅憑刺刀與敵浴血肉搏、卒得絕大之勝利、是役也、我軍除進展羅店長途汽車站外、同時並乘勝佔領羅店東北兩面之村落共達六處、敵軍傷亡重大、損失尤鉅、</p>
<p>嘉定遞信、羅店西北之敵軍自被我軍痛擊潰退後、負嵎多日、仍圖頑抗、以湯家巷東北之綠皮橋為根據、任意燒殺、沿滬太路左右三四里村莊、被焚者十之七八、前日敵軍無恥、穿着刦奪農人之衣服、越界涇而西、散處棉田中、我軍奮勇搏擊、嗣又被我浦家橋方面援軍、將敵擊退至原陣綫、近日蒲華塘與界涇兩河間、陣綫旣經往復、伏屍數千、民房大半焚燬、黃姑塘以北、則較沈寂、</p>
<h3>瀏河楊林敵受奇創</h3>
<p>太倉通信、日前（廿七）下午三時許、瀏河口北茜涇東門外之新塘口、敵艦以大砲猛擊數百響、敵機以機槍掃射、掩護敵軍四百餘人以小汽輪登陸、我方沈着不還擊、俟敵登岸在半數以上、始兩翼包抄、以手溜彈機槍猛撲、是役生獲敵軍數人擊斃一百六十餘人、餘均負傷而退、翌日下午四時楊林口敵艦以大砲猛攻至數百響、附近民房擊燬甚多、有巨彈四枚、墜落在距楊林口、二十餘里之浮橋鎮龍王廟附近、鎭民戈某、以秤權之、重七十二斤、當時並有敵機三架投彈、擬破壞我該口之陣地、均未投中、我方以高射砲猛擊、燬敵機機翼尺餘下墜、始逸去、是役敵登陸約二百餘名、完全被我方消滅、</p>
<h3>滬大之東敵被擊退</h3>
<p>中央社、連日敵方有大批援軍、在楊樹浦方面增援、企圖沿軍工路突進、而與張華浜方面之敵取得聯絡、惟我軍在該處駐有重兵、敵方之企圖、終成夢想、昨日在滬江大學之東、敵我又有激戰、雙方俱已機關槍密集掃射、敵軍始終未能逼近我軍陣綫云、</p>
<h3>焚燬敵機證實擊落</h3>
<p>（本報特訊）前日中午十二時十五分、在我閘北恒豐路共和路及中山路一帶後方投彈墜燬於中山路荒塲上之敵轟炸機一架、昨晨經我軍事機關之證實、該敵機確被我軍第口口口師防空部隊用高射機關槍擊中其油槽、當塲墮燬、事後並檢得機身殘體上有‘昭和十年名古屋造’及‘四十八號’等字樣、更在附近發現兩機師殘骸上檢獲符號兩張、一名‘山本雄’、一名‘金子定一’、而昨日字林西報之記載、亦謂據當塲目擊者言、該項敵機確為我軍防空部隊所擊落云、</p>
<h3>敵軍暴行宣示海外</h3>
<p>上海律師公會宣傳組委員會、業已推定起草委員、將敵軍在滬暴行經過、搜集各報於滬戰發生日起至目前為止、一切不顧人道、用大批轟炸機投彈轟炸我國無辜民衆經過情形、譯成各國文字、刷印成冊、分送海外、</p>
<h3>同濟大學駁斥日軍</h3>
<p>日軍蓄意破壞我國文化機關、於日前砲燬同濟大學、乃日方發言人竟向外宣稱、係因該校駐有軍隊之故、該校當局昨日特發表聲明、加以駁斥、</p>
<h3>滅絕人性之舉動敵機轟炸平民</h3>
<p>北新涇周家橋被炸　死傷約計三百餘人　候渡難民同罹慘刦</p>
<p>（本報特訊）日機之暴行、仍在繼續進行之中、前日敵機一架、被我駐防軍在中山路擊落後、敵機野心不死、急圖報復、昨晨七時、隆隆之轟炸聲、震動全市、滬西之沉靜空氣、頓為之打破、敵機五小隊共十五架、在兆豐公園之西、白利南路北新涇一帶、大施轟炸、死傷者皆無辜平民、以周家橋陳家渡及北新涇鎮兩處、受害最烈、據目下統計、兩處死傷、死者約計六七十人、傷者三百餘人、此種轟炸無辜平民之殘酷行為、將更為擧世所唾罵、</p>
<p>周家橋</p>
<p>敵機分兩大隊、在周家橋陳家渡方面出現者、共計九架、投彈十餘枚、平民之被炸死傷者、死二十餘人、傷者一百餘人、經救護隊趕往救護後、一部份受傷者、送入仁濟醫院、其他則送紅十字會醫院、周家橋一帶工廠之被害者有遠東木廠、順昌石粉廠、等等、其他各處尚在調査之中、轟炸之時、鄕民四避、俱向租界兆豐公園方面奔走、半小時之後、敵機方逸去、又在其他附近村落田野投彈、周圍盤旋、至午尚在、</p>
<p>北新涇</p>
<p>本報記者於昨日中午十二時許、特驅車擬親往北新涇及周家橋兩地視察、詎車抵白利南路西端、經該處崗警力阻前進、並指示上空謂、敵機六架尚在原處各地繼續轟炸、卽各慈善團體救護人員、亦不能前往施救云云、記者無奈、祇得暫止該處、但見難民奔逃不絕、肩屍擔傷、途為之塞、傷心慘目、不忍卒睹、記者旋晤及普善山莊掩埋隊職員陸君、據吿、該處自得到周家橋及北新涇各地敵機轟炸死傷多人報吿後、立卽率隊先赴周家橋施救、比抵該處、祇見死傷纍纍、厥狀之慘、等於南站、且均屬貧苦難民、死傷最多者、係一已廢之石灰窰中、蓋被難者瞥見大隊敵機飛至、均倉皇逃入窰中、致敵機目標乃集中該處、轟炸掃射、益趨兇惡、而附近一帶草屋、均被炸燬落於浜內、當時經敝處收殮之屍身約三十餘具、傷者尚不在內、不料二次再往急救時、已無法前住、蓋敵機仍有六架、尚在原處各地繼續猛轟中、於是北新涇方面之百餘死傷者、竟無法救出、敵機之絕滅人道、實屬舉世所不容云、</p>
<p>記者視察</p>
<p>記者於本報夕刋竣事後、午後四時許復前往視察、但見殘垣頹壁、滿目皆是、蓋全鎭鬧市、已成廢墟矣、該鎭位於蘇州河之南、在羅別根路之西、其臨馬路之屋、尚屬完整、惟大街西端兩旁樓屋、均被炸燬、已成一片瓦爍、救護人員、正扒收屍體、該處受損最烈之處、為一茶肆、後連菜市、尚有四處、則毀屋較少、幸該鎮居民不多且自滬戰開始以來、留居者不及三分之一、經此浩刦、人跡幾絕、記者過一點食舖、見桌椅凌亂、杯盤狼籍、惟爐火猶熱、鍋中殘羹、尚在沸騰、想見舖主倉皇奔避之情景、至約十時、又有兩架全該處偵察、並投兩彈、至離鎮不遠之陳家渡、亦投數彈、我在渡頭候船之難民、十九炸斃、受傷者二十餘人、至死傷人數、雖無確實統計、惟估計當在二百以上、又最後飛去之日機一架、飛至中山鐵路橋上時、又投彈一枚、因其標的欠凖、將日商經營森柳鋼皮廠炸燬、着彈起火、燃烧至不可收拾、</p>
<p>目擊者言</p>
<p>據当時自周家橋被炸區域內之一目擊者聲稱、當大批敵機飛往轟炸時、適有甚多難民、結集於北新涇野鷄墩一帶、候船遣送、加之附近四鄕菜販、正在該處一帶叢集交易之時、致敵機認為最佳之屠殺目標、立時巨彈紛投、機槍如雨、於是難民菜販、均罹浩刦、至當塲死傷確數、雖無從統計、但瞥見當時伏屍之廣、至少定在百人以上、而壓斃於頹垣殘壁中之屍體、尚不在內云云、最後又據普善山莊消息、略謂僅在周家橋一處、兩次共殮埋屍身、巳達七十餘具、其他數處、尚不在內等語、觀此、則各地死傷總數、確有數百人云、</p>
<h3>英美法節略送出後日竟否認收到</h3>
<p>字林報云、英美法總領事星期六日向本埠中日當局致送節略、請將浦東華軍撤至浦東路以東與張家渡以南之某地點、及將浦江中日艦移至公平路招商局北棧以下一節、當夜有報館訪員以此事詢諸駐滬日本海軍武官及日大使署、均否認曾收到此項公文、</p>
<p>大公社云、英美法三國駐滬軍事當局、以本月三日停泊於日領館前浦江中之日艦與我浦東駐軍發生劇烈砲戰、公共租界與法租界內、均有流彈墮落、致生命財產損失頗鉅、特向中日兩方致送節略、要求日艦應移至招商北棧以下、我方軍隊亦移至浦東路以東、茲據大公社記者探悉、迄至昨日午後六時止、停泊日領館江面一帶之敵軍炮艦、及第三艦隊旗艦‘出雲’號等、迄未移動、同時三菱碼頭尚增加一日方小型炮艦云、</p>

<h3>建立內地國防工業</h3>

<p>我國工業在此全面抗戰期間。顯有作通盤籌劃。謀整個推動之必要日前中中交農成立四行聯合辦事處。并於內地十五處設置聯合貼放委員會。八月三十一日行政院又通過特種工業（卽於軍事供有關之工業）保息補助審查標凖。此項措施雖尚不能謂為戰時經濟之工業動員。要亦足以增强我國工業之國防意義。如能有效施行。非僅我長期之作戰得以支持。卽一部份砲火餘燼之工業。亦尚可成為將來復興工業之基礎。若我國實業家均能在此國策之下。從事國防工業之發展。卽可步步造成工業之戰時組織矣。茲請就保息補助條例略作具體之說明。</p>
<p>該條例第三條規定。政府對於保息之特種工業。應視實際之需要而定。按工業部門之與軍事供應有關者甚多。若一概均由政府補助。給與保息。不僅不能配合軍事上需用之緩急與數量。且一時辦理勢有難能。亦無必要。斟酌情形。視需要而定。在政府費用浩繁之戰爭時期。實可免去非必要之財政消耗也。</p>
<p>該條例又規定凡呈請保息或補助之工廠所在地。須先經審核决定。此條尤屬重要。目前與軍事有關之工業。設於沿海口岸或無軍事設防之地帶者甚多。敵機一臨。卽有毁減之虞。今後此類工業。按照政府指定地點而設立。安全必有保障。此於國防於投資均有稗益也。</p>
<p>該條例第六條規定。對特種工業保息之年限。視各該工業之需要而决定此點更顯示政府扶助工業之决意。須知軍需與軍需有關之產業。非僅需大量之資本。且資本流轉遲慢。一時不能獲利。此種工業。若非政府加以補助。或與以保息金。民間產業家。恐將望而卻步。今旣增長保息年限。則一時縱難期獲利。而民間資本亦樂於投放矣。</p>
<p>政府今日對於國防工業之建設。旣已有精密之規劃。凡稍具愛國心之產業家。均應善用其資金以爭取國家之最後勝利。而在內地建立國防工業不僅可支持抗戰。且可建立我國工業之永久基礎。較之守藏資財。依附於外人勢力之下。一味作個人之打算。其對於國家之功罪。實有天淵之別也。</p>

<h3>夜間戰地視察記</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>（本報特寫）前天晚上，記者又到吳淞方面前綫去視察了一趟。下午四時，兩輛汽車，由上海出發。頭一部是童子軍救護隊的有兩位“為國宣勞”不求聞達的司機朋友張根寶和朱全生，他倆原是華輻製帽廠的工友，自滬戰爆發，便相約投効前方，替某部義務做運輸工作·車過南市某路口，他倆買了一包饅頭懷著去吃，和我同車的潘韞德君談：“這也是他們挖荷包自吃自的”！第二部車，除我和潘君外，還有一位“之江大學”學生葉銘燕女士，也是因為憤慨暴日的侵略，想到前方去參加抗戰的實際工作的。</p>
<p>我們剛由滬南兜過滬西，漸聞軋軋機聲，由遠而近·前車張君向我們伸出四指來，我們已意會到有四架敵機，趕來“送行”。看看情勢，果然不妙，速將車停在綠蔭深處，下車散開，嚴陣以待。可是它光臨之後，並未下蛋，彼此僅心照一番，依然各奔前程·</p>
<p>路旁所見村舍建築物，雖不免破棟折樑，瘡痕斑斑，但別來數日，仍多老樣未改。最可痛心的，就是眞茹國際電台，卻新重傷了幾處要件。看那高聳的水塔，忽已倒臥於地，淅瀝淅瀝的水聲，還隱約可聞。大場過去十數里，某牛奶廠被炸死了的二百多條乳牛，東一堆血肉，西一堆屍骨，正在夕陽餘暉下，盡量琿發所有的臭氣·枝頭秋蟬，還斷斷續續地哼唱着，好像替牠們哭訴滿腹的悲怨，又好像咀咒日軍的殘暴行為！</p>
<p>金碧輝煌，美奐美輪的市中心區的市政府，在虎視𩦵瞵般的敵機眼里，勿庸諱言，自然是再中意沒有的轟炸目的物了！</p>
<p>再往西南行，江灣有數的最高學府復旦大學，也在瘋狂殘暴的敵人砲火之下，炸得“一塌糊涂”·計體育館全部炸毀，圖書館二層樓炸壞，第四宿舍屋頂全被轟，子彬院及第一宿舍，女子宿舍，均炸傷一部份；其餘辦公室，幸告無恙。</p>
<p>夜色籠罩了大地，槍砲聲也暫時寂息。但敵人連日吃了敗仗，把飛機提早飛出，有時還放出能照周徑二千公尺的照明彈，光度還較秋月皎潔，目的不過是想偵察我砲兵陣地，及我步兵夜間活動而已。此彈能連續發亮，歷時四五分鐘，某副官勸我們不要再往前走，於是只好躱躱藏藏地，改換方向，去拜訪一位抗戰英雄□□旅旅長鐘松將軍！</p>
<p>鐘將軍的年華，看來不過三十四五，但他在虹口一連數晝夜有進無退的戰報，恐怕沒有一個不於讀後而深致萬分的敬意的！的確，那幾天的血戰，我英勇殺敵的健兒，不是踏着血路衝鋒前進，便是伏在泥水齊腰的戰境里，冒百死以抗敵人的戰車大砲。但我們要知道：不有此艱苦奮鬥的精神，斷不能建成今日淞滬抗戰全綫優勢的基礎！</p>
<p>鐘將軍指着牆上軍用地圖，把當日各綫戰况講給我們聽了之後，記者想窺測戰事的前途，便以一敵軍的優點和弱點是些什麼？一問題請教他；他毫不遲疑地說：“敵軍除了多有數十條兵艦，多有幾架搗亂的飛機，其餘都是他們的弱點。”接着他又說：“第一，淞滬作戰，滿事縱積？實不便敵軍的軍兵器活動；第二，他們沒有根據地，軍實補充不易。例如敵之陸軍士兵，遠由三島買風浪至此，大都頭昏腦暈，一進吳淞，便聞殺聲，當然要使作戰精神，受到極積的影響；第三，登陸吃了敗仗，唯有跳下黃浦和長江。所以，我們不僅一人和二點勝過敵人，就是天時地利的優越。也大可制敵人於死命！我們試客觀地再思索下，這話卻非誇大之談。</p>
<p>臨別，他對於葉銘燕女⼠請求參加前綫工作的壯志，非常嘉許，特先題中國英豪四字，囑她　某種特務工作組織好，另行函約參加。此外，機會平等，他還另題“精忠報國誓死守土數字，分贈潘君和記者，一種公忠體國的精神，彷彿可於字裏行間見之。</p>
<p>歸時因沿路警戒，不許開燈，正灣路摸索，頗感不便的時候，敵機忽在遠處數了幾個照明彈，司機不禁欣然曰：“這不是照明彈，而是救命彈呀”！於是我們就很順利地安抵上海。</p>

<h3>我精銳部隊開到今晨全綫猛力反攻寶山</h3>
<p>我軍浴血前進敵死傷遍野　全綫推進兩公里正血戰中　瀏河之敵向我猛攻已擊退</p>
<p>本報特訊、今日上午十時、接前方確報、寶山方面、昨晚我軍爲保持實力計、退後以避其鋒、立卽調動全部趕上、於今晨拂曉前到達前綫、配備完竣後、會同原有守軍、全綫大擧反攻、一聲號令、我忠勇戰士、莫不浴血猛進、前仆後繼、殺聲震天、我□□方面砲隊、亦以重炮集中火力、向敵陣地猛力轟擊、同時月浦及獅子林方面我軍亦向寶山側面奮進、敵倉皇失措、應戰一小時後、敵軍陣地漸呈動搖、旋卽狼狽潰竄紛紛後退、死傷遍野、我軍乘勝追擊、全綫推進兩公里、刻在寶山城外周圍約一公里地帶、混戰惡鬥中、預料至遲今晚當可克復寶山、</p>
<p>中央社、寶山城於昨日傍晚、經激烈抗戰之後、淪陷敵手、我軍扼守月浦至獅子林之綫、阻截敵軍前進、防其與羅店方面之殘敵取得聯絡、並於今晨拂曉、得到生力軍之增援、猛力向寶山方面反攻、刻正在距離寶山城約三里許之三官堂一帶、與敵血戰之中、</p>
<h3>我生力軍開到寶山</h3>
<p>我軍某部現正死守寶山城內　援軍某部已開到今日有劇戰</p>
<p>寶山縣城、地處江濱、殊難防守、原非軍事要塞、但我駐兵壁壘堅固、敵雖一再增援、向我進犯、終未得手、待前日（四日）敵軍由城北沙龍口江岸偷渡登陸、凡四百餘人、利用海陸空三軍立體式的向我陣地猛撲、同時吳淞砲台灣之敵、亦向側面推進、我駐兵奮勇抵抗、百折不撓、雙方砲火猛烈、血戰肉搏、死傷俱重、我軍因三面受敵、形勢孤立、不得下略向後退、而寶山與楊行間之公路、當亦被敵軍截斷、昨日（五日）下午、敵又大批增援、傾全力來犯、向寶山縣城進攻、我軍憑險扼守、抵抗至烈、惟敵以砲艦及飛機猛烈轟炸、傷亡頗重、至今晨止、我軍某部、在寶山城內、死守待援、自昨晚至今晨、我□師大批援軍、業已開到、已將敵軍四面堵住、今日必有激戰、當不難挽回危局、</p>
<h3>滬東之敵今晨向我猛攻</h3>

<p>昨晚有敵方援軍約計三千人、並有砲兵一隊、携帶天砲多尊、分乘運輸艦四艘、由滬東登陸增援、楊樹浦一帶、至今晨拂曉、此增援部隊、恊同原駐該處之陸戰隊、在重砲掩護之下、向我軍工路及引翔鄕一帶、併力猛攻、敵機多架、亦出動助戰、向我陣地不斷轟炸、同時敵司令艦出雲號、率領敵艦二十餘艘、泊駐虬江碼頭附近之江面、以密集之砲火、企圖掩護另一部之敵軍、由虬江碼頭登岸、期與楊樹浦方面之敵、收夾擊之效、測敵軍之目的、企圖由軍工路及引翔鄕方面突進、而與張華浜方面之敵、取得聯絡、我軍奮勇應戰、雖砲彈及炸彈如雨而下、絕不稍退、一俟敵軍逼近、卽以機開槍密集掃射、激戰之烈、得未曾有、經八小時之血戰、我軍陣綫絕無變動、迄午後一時止、尚在激戰之中、</p>
<h3>瀏河之敵向我猛攻</h3>
<p>敵機飛太倉嘉定轟炸</p>
<p>瀏河方面之敵、昨夜起又在猛烈砲火掩護之下、開始向我猛攻、籍以牽制我方兵力、企圖使羅店東北盛橘一帶被我包圍之敵、可以突圍而出、我軍沈着應戰、敵終不得逞、今晨又有敵機多架、在太倉及嘉定一帶轟炸、被燬民房甚多、域內居民紛紛逃避、</p>

<h3>東區雙方砲戰激烈</h3>
<p>楊樹浦之敵擬溝通張華浜陣地砲　火密集戰事激烈敵不支潰退</p>
<p>今晨三時半、楊樹浦及滬江大學方面敵軍、約有七八百名、會同我軍陣地衝鋒夾攻、浦中敵艦、亦頻頻發砲助戰、企圖奪取該處地帶、完成南北聯絡一氣、但該處我方駐有重兵、無時不在嚴密戒備中、故當時我軍立卽分途奮勇出戰、集中機槍及手榴彈火力掃射、我□□□砲兵隊亦以排砲猛力還轟、激戰約兩小時、敵仍不支潰退原有陣地內、我軍亦未窮追、此役敵軍死傷甚重、我軍犧牲亦不小、</p>
<h3>羅店殘敵形勢孤立</h3>
<p>數度掙扎均不支潰退　我兵力雄厚决無差池</p>
<p>羅店方面、自昨日我軍奮勇殺敵、進佔滬太長途汽車站後、被圍殘敵、仍在頑抗、但形勢更見孤立、又羅店西北之敵軍、前昨兩日、屢向沈家橋曹王廟一帶推進、企圖突破我嘉定之陣綫、以解羅店之圍、但數度進攻、均經我軍迎頭痛擊、不支潰退、現雖固守待援、負隅頑抗、惟該處我有口師以上兵力、誓死决不容敵軍越雷池一步、</p>
<h3>敵反攻江灣路慘敗</h3>
<p>鐵甲戰車一輛被我虜獲　截至今晨雙方各守原防</p>
<p>江灣路·八字橋·靑雲橋·及虹口一帶、自三日晚四日晨間、敵曾一度傾其全力向八字橋·靑雲橋·我軍防地偷襲、被我重創潰退後、四日午、楊樹浦敵軍又被我□□砲隊所轟擊、因此連日來、該處全綫敵軍、深慮我軍乘機進撲、入晚不時以極少數部隊在沿綫偷襲騷擾、我軍洞燭其計、輒佯作不察、待其將近、突予痛擊、敵見受挫、頓起恐慌、又急以追擊砲·小鋼砲·機槍·等、作漫無標的之亂射、藉以阻我進擊、但我軍鎮靜不動、惟遇機卽予以重大報復、昨晨、敵軍又以鐵甲車三輛、領導步兵向我陣地攻來、當被我軍迎頭痛擊、用機關槍、平射砲、追擊砲向敵軍戰車轟射、中有一輛被我虜獲、其餘二輛、被我射傷逃回、敵全軍亦鼠竄而遁、至今晨止、雙方仍各守原來陣地、對峙扼守中、</p>
<h3>浦東陣地鞏固無慮</h3>
<p>敵雖日夜圖謀登陸均予擊退</p>
<p>敵軍企圖浦東、事前確經極度之密謀、故其來犯、亦傾全力、自經四日午、在雙方猛烈砲戰中、仍歸失敗後、但其野心、仍未稍戢、二三小艇、時常出沒於浦江水面、間或向岸遙射數槍後、卽悄然遁去、同時敵艦敵機、亦頻向該處施加轟擊、希冀偷渡登陸、得以實現、無奈我軍佈置嚴密、非但敵軍無隙可乘、且全軍覆沒、鎩羽而還、惟敵鑒於三週來淞區戰事失利、喪失奇重、而後來援軍、又蹙處艦上、無地自容、因此對於浦東企圖、始終未曾放棄、且有緊急以謀之勢、故連日來敵機敵艦仍不斷出動轟擊、但我軍陣地堅固、防守嚴密、敵之企圖、徒自妄想耳、</p>
<p>日軍自於三日上午、派兵至春江碼頭、圖犯浦東、經我軍奮勇近擊、激戰至當晚七時始止、彼方登陸企圖、卒未如願、敵軍遭此打擊、野心稍戢、故前昨兩日局勢、轉趨平靜、詎昨晚十時後、停泊楊樹浦之若干敵艦、又向浦東洋涇以南一帶、開砲轟擊、漫無目標、我軍洞悉彼方策略、此種虛張聲勢、無非欲防我浦東軍隊對日艦有所行動、故藉砲火以為示威、故我軍間亦開放數砲還擊、有時卽置之不理、敵方砲聲時稀時密、直至天明後、始行停止、一晚所放之砲彈、我方絕未受損、至晨間七時許、敵機四架、又至浦東上空盤旋偵察、越半小時、卽行飛去、</p>

<h3>第二次歐戰快要爆發麼（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>㊀導火綫就是西班牙事變？</p>
<p>自從去年西班牙事變發生以來，在歐洲到處就充滿着戰爭的空氣。第二次歐戰什麼時候爆發呢？這幾乎是歐洲民間每日所担心的問題。因為此次事變的雙方陣綫太鮮明了。德意帮助佛蘭戈將軍，法俄帮助“人民陣綫”政府。主義上的衝突，（社會主義與法西斯蒂主義，）經濟上的衝突，（德國想獲得西班牙的市場，）軍事地理上的衝突，（英意在地中海上爭霸，）這種種原因使事態更加嚴重而復雜。假如西班牙事變實是西班牙的內部問題，那末是非此日早已解决，决没有引起國際纠纷的理由。但後台老板是國際政治舞台上的巨頭，我們想像不出，墨索利尼，布特勒會限者着佛蘭⼽將軍失敗。同樣的我們也无法相信，法俄兩國，甚至於英國，不以實力來維持“人民陣綫”政府的存在。一個“意製”的法西斯蒂西班牙是以變換歐洲目前的局面。反過來說，一個社會主義的西班牙，間接也會挫折墨索列尼，蒂特勒的氣勢。西班牙，固然不是雙方最後决戰的地方，但却是雙方决戰前的一個序幕。那一個人肯讓步呢？墨索列尼，布特勒，或者斯太林，萊翁白倫，甚至於張伯倫？</p>
<p>悲觀嗎？自然，在這種局面下，誰又能夠樂觀！近來勸吿人民安心的政治家，只有南非洲總理賀滋格將軍，不過由於他的解釋，目前歐洲所以不容易發生戰事，並不是各國會特別親善，只因為大家過分你怕我，我怕你，結果才到了誰都不放先動手的地步。英外相艾登的樂觀程度就更差一點·他有一次在私人談話中曾向某國外交部長表示“年來他已經變成了一個容易滿足的人，他說：目前的局面難不會有轉好的希望但還沒有再壞不下。這一點，他覺得已有可以滿意的理由。</p>
<p>▲墨索列尼發了瘋？目前一般歐洲人所最恐怖的一個人，自然是墨索列尼。兩年前，當大家正在咒罵希特勒的時候，許多人稱譽他，一個識時務的大政治家。他對奧問題態度的强硬并堅决，曾獲得英法兩國物質上的同情。當時法國政府送他的過年禮物的便是一塊非洲殖民地，但在阿比西尼亞的侵略戰爭中，墨索利尼已經露出他的兇相一種，最少在英國人看來不能夠忍受的兇相·等到西班牙事變一起，他與希特勒同是佛蘭戈將軍幕後的主持人？意大利的飛機，大砲，坦克車，甚至於意大利的軍隊、都在西班牙內戰中担任一個主要的角色，起色，墨索利尼說，這全部新聞都是外國報紙造謠，後來呢，意大利的官報却正式發表參加西班牙內戰陣亡的意國將士名單。認為這批人是為了主義而犧牲的英雄·自從墨索利尼的熊度公開以後，大家便想知道，墨索利尼的目的到底要做到什麼地步才止。墨索利尼在一篇文章中曾回答：要解决西班牙問題，只有佛蘭戈獲得最後的勝利！”照過去的經騐看來，他是一位不容易屈服的人。意大利在他一人統治之下、他又是一個“說得出做得到”的“好漢，”意大利旣然願以武力作佛蘭戈將軍的後盾，第二次歐戰爆發的可能性自然更大，我們只要看德意兩國艦隊新近退出西班牙的海面監察，同時在倫敦“不干涉委員會”中更提議下列各種第一，各國承認佛蘭戈為交戰團體，第二，取消各國艦隊的海面監察。第三，主張陸上監察應維持現狀。德意兩國這種提議，說得淺白一點，就是德意的軍火仍可以由海路自由供給佛蘭戈將軍，而把法國供給“人民陣綫”政府軍火的陸路截斷，英法兩國已表示絕對無法接受這個提議，墨索列尼的手段愈來愈兇了。一般人禁不住要問，到底是否他發了瘋？據說，他不但不願意撤退八萬在西班牙會戰的意大利志願軍，甚至於他運有陸續添派隊伍的準備，</p>
<p>▲法國不能夠再讓步？　　在西班牙事變中，最有容忍度量的人，火約要算萊翁白倫。同是“人民陣綫”的政府，法國怎能夠坐視佛蘭戈將軍步步勝利！但另一面法國對西班牙的政策根本又不能夠脫離英國而獨立。結果呢，只好兩方面都兼顧一點，這是說，不干涉政策到一半，同時供給“人民陣綫”政府的軍火也做到一半。不過法國這種熊度並得不到各方的同情。在德意眼中，法國始終同蘇俄一樣的“無恥”，帮助西班牙的“赤色委員會”或“赤色的西班牙”。（德意人對有“人民陣綫”政府的稱呼）。國際間左派份子又覺得法國過於軟弱無能，幾乎間接變成佛蘭戈屠殺西班牙民衆的助手。法國人這種苦衷，事實上，不是一般局外人所能夠容易了解的。</p>
<p>雖然，法國人的讓步是有限度的。萊翁白倫雖沒有像墨索利尼那種不可一世的氣概，但他决不至於眼看着西班牙的“人民陣綫”政府崩潰。新近法國外交當局對於德意兩國的答復已上分明顯。就是一旦不干涉政策一失敗，法國就要把她的邊境打開，讓軍火自由輸入西班牙並且根據幾家英國報紙的記載，法國已配置有大批飛機，坦克車，火砲等等在西班牙的邊界上。只要倫敦“不干涉委員會”一塌臺，幾小時以後這批軍火就可以運入西班牙國境。此刻法國人好像已表示他們的决心。現在要仔細考慮的人，似乎是墨索利尼與希特勒。這就是說，第二次歐戰爆發後，他們兩人到底有沒有絕對勝利的把握。假如他們一定要冒險的話。</p>
<p>▲英國人的對策英國首相張伯倫勸吿英國人民在目前這種嚴重的局面下，應需保留一種冷靜的頭腦。自由黨大政治家勞合喬治說，這並不難，每條魚都有它冷“靜”的頭腦。他責備英國的中立政策是間接帮助佛蘭戈將軍。外相艾登說，英國唯一的希望，就是將西班牙問題局部化，不至於引起國際間的糾紛保守黨大政治家邱吉爾表示，英國人同西班牙人一樣，注重西班牙領土的完整。無論那方而勝利，假如別國想在西班牙造成了一種軍事根據地，英國是不能夠坐視的。總之，照目前英國一般政治家的意見，佛蘭戈個人似乎還在其次，主要的對像，就是怎樣的對付他的慕後人——墨索利尼。</p>
<p>張伯倫所謂的冷靜頭腦，自然是“乘風轉舵”。本來英國的外交政策一向是“能屈能伸”的。佛蘭戈目前已估領了西班牙三分之一。倘若他一旦眞的變成了西班牙的獨裁者，同墨素利尼，希特勒鼎足而三，那時候英國在地中海的地位豈不是要發生危險？英國目前的對策，就是設法拆散這三位獨裁者的結合。</p>
<p>英國的第一步棋，就是使一向在英國卵翼之下的葡萄牙與意大利斷絕關係，然後由葡萄牙直接去影響佛蘭戈，間接鞏固英國在西班牙的勢力。（是說，萬一佛蘭戈獲得最後的勝利）。葡萄牙素來是英國勢力系統下的一個小國。此次因為地理上主義上的關係，曾帮助佛蘭戈將軍，因之才與意大利發生關係。英國是一位舊主，所以這個政策立刻發生相當的効力。新近葡萄牙的親英論調並佛蘭戈將軍也表示願意撤退各國在西班牙的志願軍。（這一點是英國人的主張）。這種“斧底抽薪”的辦法，雖說實現此較困難，但已足給墨索利尼一個很大的打擊。</p>
<p>第二步棋，就是設法拆散墨索利尼希特勒的姻緣。據英國一家報紙的記載，英國曾向德國提出下列的幾個交換條件，假如德國對於西班牙事件肯轉變熊度，不與意大利合作的話：</p>
<p>一，供給德國以工業原料。</p>
<p>二，設法增加德國的出口貿易。</p>
<p>三，英國願担任借給德國一筆大借款。</p>
<p>目前德國的經濟正在困難萬分的時代，這個提議自然是個大誘惑。加之，此次在西班牙內戰中試騐的結果，除了高射砲以外、其他德製的軍械並不比法俄兵工廠的出品精良，所以希特勒目前也走上了交义路口，說不定這德意兩位獨裁者不久也有分家的可能。　　　　新近英國金融界中人的口號是：德國給世界（英國）以和平，英國以借款！</p>

<h3>Enemy Reinforcements of Two Divisions Arrive in Shanghai, Our Morale is High, Preparing for a Major Battle</h3>
<p>The Enemy Attempts to Sneak Attack Shizilin, Our Troops Will Inflict Painful Annihilation. Our Troops Have Recaptured the Shanghai Bus Station in Luodian. Enemy Planes Flew Over West Shanghai Yesterday, Bombing and Massacring Civilians.</p>
<p>The following is a summary of the battle situation up to 4:00 AM this morning: ① A large number of enemy reinforcements have arrived in Shanghai, stationed in Yangshupu, Zhanghuabang, Wusong, and other places. They will launch a major offensive within days. Our army is in high spirits, waiting in full battle array, and will resolutely deal them a heavy blow when the time comes. ② A portion of the enemy reinforcements, transported by enemy warships, are concentrated in the Shizilin area, appearing to be preparing for a large-scale sneak landing. We are fully prepared, and no one will be allowed to return alive if they come. ③ The remaining enemies in the Luodian area are still surrounded by our troops. Our army has now advanced to the Luodian Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus station, taking advantage of the victory to recover six villages northeast of Luodian. ④ In the Yangshupu-Jiangwan area, apart from intense artillery battles last night, there was no major contact between the two sides. Our front line remains unmoved. ⑤ In the Zhabei area, the enemy launched attacks on our positions with small units several times late at night. Small steel cannons and machine guns fired intensely for a while, but when our troops jumped out of the trenches to pursue them, they quickly retreated. The purpose was purely to harass and was irrelevant to the overall battle situation. Our army calmly swept and drove them away, and the enemy ultimately failed.</p>
<p>At 2:30 AM this morning, enemy warships in the Huangpu River frequently fired intermittent bursts of artillery fire, bombarding our positions in Zhabei and Jiangwan. Interspersed with the artillery fire were machine gun bursts that came and went, seemingly probing our positions. Our army responded calmly, not thrown into disarray. By 3:00 AM this morning, the artillery fire gradually subsided, and the machine gun fire also ceased, but the enemy warships' searchlights continued to illuminate the sky, defending against an air force attack.</p>
<h3>Baoshan City Fell to the Enemy Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, after the enemy troops landed in Wusong Town, they were pressured by our troops and pursued to the riverbank. Since the night of the 3rd, the enemy has repeatedly reinforced their forces, launching repeated offensives against us. The two sides advanced and retreated repeatedly, fighting fiercely. On the night of the 4th, a portion of the enemy troops landed from Paotaiwan and advanced rapidly towards Baoshan, launching an invasion. Our army bravely met the attack, fighting a bloody battle all night. The enemy army suffered heavy casualties. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy again sent a large number of reinforcements, launching a full-scale attack. Our army resisted extremely fiercely, but suffered heavy casualties due to the intense bombing by enemy warships and aircraft. The remaining troops were forced to retreat into Baoshan City. The enemy then bombarded the city fiercely with heavy artillery and aircraft, and our army made heroic sacrifices. Residents also suffered greatly, and the city fell into the hands of the enemy. Currently, our line from Shizilin to Yuepu Town is still guarded by heavy troops, and the enemy's attempt to communicate with the remaining enemies in the Luodian area will definitely not succeed.</p>
<h3>A Large Enemy Reinforcement of Two Divisions Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>They Landed in Various Locations in Wusong Yesterday. The Number in the Yangshupu Area is Also Large.</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The enemy warships that arrived at the mouth of the Song River the day before yesterday totaled forty-nine, carrying two enemy divisions of newly arrived reinforcements and a large amount of military supplies and ammunition. A portion of these reinforcements and ammunition were transported into the Huangpu River the day before yesterday at midnight by five enemy transport ships, two merchant ships, and two destroyers. Three of the five transport ships docked at the Yangshupu Wharf, and two docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf. One of the two merchant ships docked at the Huangpu Wharf, and one docked at the Osaka Wharf. The two destroyers docked at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf. This batch of reinforcements and ammunition was quickly unloaded and disembarked at the above-mentioned wharves. A large number of enemy heavy weapons were also unloaded and brought ashore at the Yangshupu Wharf (near the Shanghai Electric Power Company).</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) After the enemy troops retreated in defeat, they appealed to Tokyo for reinforcements. The day before yesterday, a large number of enemy warships, totaling more than forty, consisting of a mix of merchant ships and transport ships, gathered outside the Wusongkou. It is estimated that a total of two divisions of reinforcements were transported. Most of the reinforcements landed in Wusong yesterday morning and are said to be issuing orders for a full-scale general attack on the entire front within days, attempting to break through the encirclement. Our army is waiting in full battle array, ready to give them a head-on blow when the time comes.</p>
<p>After the enemy reinforcement units of two divisions arrived at the mouth of the Song River, they heard that all lines on the shore had failed and were urgently awaiting rescue. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, a portion of the enemy troops, about two regiments in number, under the cover of heavy artillery, landed at the temporary wharf built by the enemy in Zhanghuabang. In the afternoon, they joined up with the remaining enemies in Wusong Town.</p>
<p>According to news from Westerners in the Hongkou District, the number of Japanese troops gathering in the Yangshupu area in the past two days has been extremely large. Reinforcements landing from the Dalian Steamship Company Wharf in Yangshupu surged like a tide. In addition to infantry, many tanks and heavy artillery pieces were unloaded, and a large number of aircraft were transported ashore for assembly. According to the observations of Westerners, the enemy in Yangshupu seems to be planning something, and it is feared that once the landed reinforcements have been completely deployed, the enemy in the Yangshupu area will launch a large-scale attack.</p>
<p>According to the "North China Daily News", the Japanese troops in the Huishan District of Hongkou have been very active for the past few days (the 4th), appearing to be preparing to take the offensive against the Chinese army's front line. In addition to mobilizing four squadrons of eighteen-pound heavy guns and a number of tanks, a very large number of infantrymen have entered the district. At the same time, a large number of military aircraft were transported to the shore at the Dalian Steamship Company Wharf in Yangshupu for use in combat in the Shanghai area. All the aircraft were wrapped in oilcloth, only revealing their tails, so it was impossible to know what type they were.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warship Movements Busy Yesterday</h3>
<p>The movements of enemy warships sailing to Shanghai were busiest yesterday. For the three weeks since the enemy began the Shanghai offensive, although they repeatedly attempted to land at various ports in the Songjiang and along the coast, they have been met with fierce resistance from our troops and have ultimately failed. Therefore, in desperation, the enemy sailed in forty-nine transport ships the day before yesterday, fully loaded with enemy troops, hoping to reinforce the units in Shanghai that had been routed by our army. Yesterday was the day for deploying this batch of reinforcements, so there was a special reason why the enemy warships in the Huangpu River were so busy yesterday. It is estimated that since dawn yesterday morning, one enemy transport ship and one destroyer have sailed in, and one destroyer from the 21st Squadron has sailed out. Then, that destroyer sailed back in at 9:03 and sailed out again at 11:30. At 9:50, another enemy transport ship sailed in. At 11:00, one destroyer from the enemy's 23rd Squadron sailed in and sailed out again at 12:30 (at the same time, one destroyer from the 16th Squadron also sailed out). At 1:01, the enemy ship Tangyang Maru sailed in and sailed out at 4:25. At 2:30 and 3:30, the two enemy transport ships that had previously sailed in sailed out again in succession. At 4:00, one destroyer and one transport ship from the 21st Squadron sailed in. At 4:30 and 5:00, two destroyers and one gunboat from the 1st Squadron arrived. In total, enemy warships entered and exited more than twenty times yesterday, showing the extent of their busyness in deploying reinforcements and replenishing military supplies. The reporter went to the Bund at 5:00 PM yesterday to investigate and found that there were still twenty-one enemy warships anchored in the Huangpu River. Their anchoring situation was as follows: one gunboat each at Floating Dock No. 35 and No. 23, one destroyer and gunboat each at Floating Dock No. 15, one destroyer at Floating Dock No. 14, one gunboat at Floating Dock No. 11, one destroyer each at Floating Dock No. 10 and No. 7, one Izumo ship at Floating Dock No. 2, three destroyers at the Mitsubishi Wharf (one each from the 23rd, 21st, and 16th Squadrons), two transport ships and two destroyers at the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf, two destroyers from the 1st Squadron at the Nippon Yusen Wharf, one gunboat at the New Mitsui Wharf, and one merchant ship converted into a transport ship each at the Huangpu Wharf and the Osaka Wharf, for a total of twenty-one ships.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Plot to Sneak Attack Shizilin</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: Since the enemy troops reinforced the Zhanghuabang and Wenzaobang lines and forcibly landed in Wusong, they have been aggressively advancing towards Shizilin, hoping to make contact with the enemy in the Luodian area. However, our forces in Shizilin are strong and have given the enemy a head-on blow, and the enemy's plan has not yet succeeded. Therefore, the enemy has changed its plan and is attempting to land by stealth in the Shizilin area. Since last Thursday, four enemy warships have repeatedly attacked, attempting to land, but have been repelled by our army with intense machine gun fire. It is now known that the enemy troops have seized many of our civilian ships and concentrated them on the Shizilin river surface yesterday, appearing to be preparing for a large-scale sneak landing. Our army is now on strict alert, preparing to inflict heavy damage on the enemy.</p>
<h3>Map of the Wusong Estuary Situation</h3>
<h3>We Recapture Luodian Bus Station</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: After our army cut off the enemy's rear in the Xiaochuansha area and completed the encirclement of the enemy in the Luodian area, the most important development in the past twenty-four hours yesterday was that our army, after fierce fighting, recaptured the Luodian Long-Distance Bus Station. The reason was that our army approached the enemy under the cover of artillery fire the night before, engaging in close combat. In addition to attacking with hand grenades, our army relied solely on bayonets to engage in bloody hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, ultimately achieving a great victory. In this battle, our army not only advanced to the Luodian Long-Distance Bus Station but also took advantage of the victory to occupy a total of six villages northeast of Luodian. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and great losses.</p>
<p>Jiading Postal News: The enemy troops northwest of Luodian, after being defeated and routed by our army, have stubbornly resisted for many days, using the Green Leather Bridge northeast of Tangjia Lane as a base, arbitrarily burning, killing, and looting the villages three or four miles to the left and right of the Shanghai-Taicang Road. Seventy to eighty percent of the villages were burned. The enemy troops were shameless the day before yesterday, wearing clothes robbed from farmers and scattering themselves in the cotton fields west of Jie Jing. Our army fought bravely, and was later reinforced by our troops from Pujiaqiao, who drove the enemy back to their original front line. Recently, the front lines between the Puhuatang and Jie Jing rivers have been repeatedly fought over, with thousands of bodies lying on the ground and most of the civilian houses burned down. The area north of Huanggutang is relatively quiet.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Suffers Strange Losses in Liuhe and Yanglin</h3>
<p>Taicang Correspondence: The day before yesterday (the 27th), at about 3:00 PM, at the Xintang Estuary outside the East Gate of Xijing in the Liuhekou area, enemy warships fired hundreds of heavy artillery shells, and enemy aircraft strafed with machine guns, covering the landing of more than 400 enemy troops in small steamships. Our side calmly did not retaliate, waiting for more than half of the enemy to land before flanking them from both sides and attacking fiercely with hand grenades and machine guns. In this battle, several enemy soldiers were captured alive, more than 160 were killed, and the rest were wounded and retreated. At 4:00 PM the next day, enemy warships attacked Yanglinkou with heavy artillery up to hundreds of shells, destroying many civilian houses nearby. Four giant shells fell near the Longwang Temple in Fuqiao Town, more than 20 miles from Yanglinkou. A local resident, Mr. Ge, weighed them with a scale weight, and they weighed 72 catties. At that time, three enemy aircraft dropped bombs, attempting to destroy our positions at that port, but none of them hit. Our side struck fiercely with anti-aircraft guns, damaging the enemy aircraft's wings by more than a foot, causing it to fall before escaping. In this battle, about 200 enemy soldiers landed, but they were completely annihilated by our side.</p>
<h3>The Enemy East of Shanghai University is Repelled</h3>
<p>Central News Agency: In recent days, a large number of enemy reinforcements have been added in the Yangshupu area, attempting to break through along the Jungong Road and connect with the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area. However, our army has stationed heavy troops in that area, and the enemy's attempt has ultimately become a dream. Yesterday, there was another fierce battle between the enemy and us east of Shanghai University. Both sides fired intensely with machine guns, but the enemy was never able to approach our army's front line.</p>
<h3>Burning of Enemy Aircraft Confirmed as Shot Down</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) One enemy bomber, which dropped bombs in our rear area near Hengfeng Road, Gonghe Road, and Zhongshan Road in Zhabei at 12:15 PM the day before yesterday and crashed in a wilderness on Zhongshan Road, was confirmed yesterday morning by our military authorities. The enemy aircraft was indeed hit by the anti-aircraft machine guns of our [redacted] Division's air defense unit, and its oil tank was destroyed on the spot, causing it to crash and burn. Afterwards, the body of the aircraft was examined and found to have the words "Showa 10 Nagoya Made" and "No. 48" on it. Two symbols were also found on the remains of two pilots nearby, one named "Yamamoto Yu" and one named "Kaneko Teiichi." Moreover, yesterday's "North China Daily News" also stated that according to eyewitnesses at the scene, the enemy aircraft was indeed shot down by our air defense unit.</p>
<h3>Enemy Army's Atrocities Declared Overseas</h3>
<p>The Publicity Committee of the Shanghai Bar Association has appointed a drafting committee to collect reports from various newspapers from the date of the outbreak of the Shanghai war to the present, detailing all the enemy army's atrocities in Shanghai, disregarding humanitarianism and using large numbers of bombers to bomb our innocent civilians. This information will be translated into various languages, printed into a booklet, and distributed overseas.</p>
<h3>Tongji University Refutes the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>The Japanese army deliberately destroyed our country's cultural institutions and shelled Tongji University the other day. However, a Japanese spokesperson claimed to the outside world that it was because the school was garrisoned by troops. The school authorities issued a statement yesterday to refute this claim.</p>
<h3>Inhuman Acts: Enemy Planes Bomb Civilians</h3>
<p>Zhoujia Bridge and Beixinjing Bombed, Approximately 300 Casualties. Refugees Waiting to Cross the River Suffer the Same Tragic Fate.</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper) The Japanese aircraft's atrocities are continuing. After an enemy aircraft was shot down in Zhongshan Road by our defending troops the day before yesterday, the enemy aircraft were unwilling to accept defeat and sought revenge. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, the rumbling of bombing shook the entire city, and the quiet air of West Shanghai was shattered. Five squadrons of enemy aircraft, a total of fifteen, bombed the Beixinjing area west of Zhaofeng Park and north of Bailinan Road, causing casualties among innocent civilians. Zhoujia Bridge, Chenjiadu, and Beixinjing Town suffered the most. According to current statistics, there were approximately sixty to seventy deaths and more than three hundred injuries in the two places. This cruel act of bombing innocent civilians will be condemned by the world.</p>
<p>Zhoujia Bridge</p>
<p>A total of nine enemy aircraft appeared in the Zhoujia Bridge and Chenjiadu areas in two large squadrons, dropping more than ten bombs. More than twenty civilians were killed and more than one hundred injured. After rescue teams rushed to the scene, some of the injured were sent to Renji Hospital, and others were sent to the Red Cross Hospital. The factories damaged in the Zhoujia Bridge area included the Far East Wood Factory and the Shunchang Stone Powder Factory, among others. Other places are still under investigation. At the time of the bombing, the villagers fled in all directions, running towards the Zhaofeng Park area in the concession. Half an hour later, the enemy aircraft left, and then dropped bombs in other nearby villages and fields, circling around until noon.</p>
<p>Beixinjing</p>
<p>Our newspaper reporter drove to Beixinjing and Zhoujia Bridge at about 12:00 PM yesterday to inspect the situation, but when the car arrived at the western end of Bailinan Road, the police on duty there forcibly prevented them from advancing and pointed to the sky, saying that six enemy aircraft were still continuing to bomb various places in the original area, and even rescue workers from various charitable organizations could not go there to provide assistance. The reporter had no choice but to stop there temporarily, but saw a continuous stream of refugees fleeing, carrying corpses and the injured. The road was blocked, and the scene was heartbreaking and unbearable to witness. The reporter then met Mr. Lu, an official from the Pusshan Villa burial team, who said that after receiving reports of many deaths and injuries from enemy aircraft bombings in Zhoujia Bridge and Beixinjing, he immediately led his team to Zhoujia Bridge to provide assistance. When they arrived, they saw piles of dead and injured, the scene as tragic as at the South Station, and they were all poor refugees. Most of the deaths and injuries occurred in a disused lime kiln, because the victims saw a large squadron of enemy aircraft flying over and all rushed into the kiln in panic, causing the enemy aircraft to concentrate their targets on that area, bombing and strafing even more fiercely. The surrounding straw houses were all destroyed and fell into the river. At that time, our office collected about thirty corpses, not including the injured. Unexpectedly, when they went back for a second rescue, they could not go because six enemy aircraft were still continuing to bomb fiercely in the original area. As a result, the hundreds of deaths and injuries in Beixinjing could not be rescued. The enemy aircraft's inhumanity is unacceptable to the world.</p>
<p>Reporter's Inspection</p>
<p>The reporter went back to inspect at around 4:00 PM after finishing the evening edition of this newspaper, but saw only ruins and rubble everywhere. The entire bustling town had become a wasteland. The town is located south of the Suzhou River and west of Robeugen Road. The houses facing the road are still relatively intact, but the buildings on both sides of the western end of the main street have been destroyed and have become a pile of rubble. Rescue workers are collecting corpses. The most severely damaged place is a teahouse, followed by the vegetable market. There are also four other places with less damage. Fortunately, there are not many residents in the town, and since the start of the Shanghai war, less than a third of them have remained. After this disaster, there are almost no signs of life. The reporter passed a snack shop and saw the tables and chairs in disarray, with cups and plates in a mess. Only the stove was still hot, and the leftover food in the pot was still boiling, imagining the shopkeeper's panicked escape. At about 10:00, two enemy aircraft came to reconnoiter the area and dropped two bombs. Several bombs were also dropped on Chenjiadu, not far from the town. Nineteen refugees waiting for a boat at the dock were killed, and more than twenty were injured. Although there are no exact statistics on the number of deaths and injuries, it is estimated that it is over two hundred. Finally, when an enemy aircraft flew over the Zhongshan Railway Bridge, it dropped another bomb, which, because its target was inaccurate, destroyed the Moriryu Steel Skin Factory run by the Japanese, causing a fire that burned uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Eyewitness Account</p>
<p>According to an eyewitness from the bombed area of Zhoujia Bridge, when a large number of enemy aircraft flew to bomb, many refugees happened to be gathered in the Yejidun area of Beixinjing, waiting for boats to be sent away. In addition, vegetable vendors from the surrounding villages were gathering in that area to trade, causing the enemy aircraft to consider it the best target for slaughter. Immediately, huge bombs were dropped and machine guns rained down, causing the refugees and vegetable vendors to suffer the same tragic fate. Although it is impossible to statistically determine the exact number of deaths and injuries on the spot, the sight of the corpses lying everywhere at that time was at least over a hundred, not including the bodies crushed in the rubble. Finally, according to Pusshan Villa's news, only in Zhoujia Bridge, a total of more than seventy corpses were collected and buried in two separate trips. Other places are not included. Judging from this, the total number of deaths and injuries in various places is indeed several hundred.</p>
<h3>Japan Denies Receiving the Notes From Britain, America, and France After They Were Sent</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that the Consuls General of Britain, America, and France sent notes to the Chinese and Japanese authorities in Shanghai on Saturday, requesting that the Chinese troops in Pudong be withdrawn to a certain location east of Pudong Road and south of Zhangjiadu, and that the Chinese and Japanese warships in the Huangpu River be moved to a location below Fair Road and the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf. That night, reporters from news organizations inquired about this matter with the Japanese naval attaché and the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, but both denied having received the official documents.</p>
<p>The "Ta Kung Pao" reported that the military authorities of Britain, America, and France in Shanghai, citing the fierce artillery battles on the 3rd of this month between the Japanese warships anchored in the Huangpu River in front of the Japanese Consulate and our troops stationed in Pudong, and that stray bullets fell in the Public Concession and the French Concession, causing significant loss of life and property, sent notes to both China and Japan, requesting that the Japanese warships be moved to a location below the China Merchants Bureau's North Wharf, and that our troops also be moved to a location east of Pudong Road. According to reporters from the "Ta Kung Pao," as of 6:00 PM yesterday, enemy gunboats and the Third Fleet flagship "Izumo" anchored in the river area in front of the Japanese Consulate had not moved, and a small Japanese gunboat had been added to the Mitsubishi Wharf.</p>

<h3>American Maritime Workers' Union and Peace Groups Demand Government Stop Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Reiterating Various Principles of International Treaties, Advocating Economic Blockade Against Japan, and Aiding China's Post-War Reconstruction</p>
<p>[Washington] A U.S. government spokesperson announced today that, while various parties in the country have petitioned the government to take swift action on the Far East incident, the government's Far East policy is still based on lasting world peace. Speaking in a personal capacity, the spokesperson asked that the government not blindly follow the prestige of pacifism in the bomb craters, while proponents of pacifism hide in bomb shelters or lightly display their force. The State Department is currently seeking to adhere to treaties such as the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees China's sovereignty and territorial integrity (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th).</p>
<p>[Washington] Six American peace organizations today jointly requested that the United States take the lead in abandoning all extraterritorial rights in China and proposed a suggestion to protect China and promote peace in the Far East, including the following four points: ① Abandoning all demands that undermine China's sovereignty; ② Abandoning public concessions and extraterritorial rights; ③ Abolishing the American ban on Eastern immigration; ④ Finding ways to assist the Chinese government in economic construction during the war. At the same time, they also demanded that the United States implement neutrality laws (National Telegram, 4th).</p>
<p>[New York] The American Seafarers Union, the New York Seafarers Union, and the International Longshoremen's Association today all agreed that American workers should boycott the shipment of military supplies to Japan, and called Japan an aggressor nation that violated the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty. The United States should intervene (National Telegram, 4th).</p>
<p>[New York] Regarding the war between China and Japan, after six American pacifist organizations and the American Veterans Association successively telegraphed President Roosevelt, requesting the immediate implementation of neutrality laws, the American League of Nations Association, the Church Peace Union, the World Alliance Association, and key figures supporting the League of Nations also sent letters to Secretary of State Reed, requesting the implementation of neutrality laws and criticizing the various clauses of the neutrality laws, stating that the principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty must be reiterated by all signatory countries on this occasion. In addition, eight maritime workers unions have also submitted a petition to the Department of Commerce, advocating that the United States should cooperate with the signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty to stop the Sino-Japanese war. One union also demanded that an economic blockade be imposed on Japan and that China be given full assistance (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency).</p>
<p>[Washington] Local Filipino-American business circles today deeply believe that the Sino-Japanese war will drastically increase the sales of American goods in the Philippines, because the retail industry in the Philippines is mostly controlled by overseas Chinese. Now that China and Japan are at war, they are competing to boycott Japanese goods, and they will inevitably purchase more American goods. Moreover, the Japanese side believes that if the war is prolonged, the United States may change its policy on the issue of Philippine independence in order to protect American economic interests (National Telegram, 4th).</p>
<h3>Konoe and Hirota's Speeches on China Policy</h3>
<p>Seeking to Create Peace Through Aggression, and to Eliminate Our Will to Resist Japan</p>
<p>⊙Tokyo: Prime Minister Konoe delivered a speech at the House of Peers this morning, the main points of which are as follows: Japan's fundamental policy has always been to seek friendship with China and to have her abandon her anti-Japanese policy in order to fundamentally readjust the relationship between the two countries. This has not changed to this day. Unfortunately, China does not understand this true intention, leading to a rapid deterioration of the situation. Therefore, Japan believes that its previous passive and localized policies cannot resolve this situation, and has ultimately been forced to actively and comprehensively deliver a major blow to China. It is unprecedented in the East and West for a country to adopt the exclusion and humiliation of other countries as its national policy, and to use this as an educational policy to teach young children. If the Chinese government truly reflects on its actions, expresses its sincerity in future cooperation with Japan, makes efforts to promote Far Eastern culture, and establishes peace in East Asia, then Japan will not pursue the matter. The measures currently adopted by Japan are nothing more than to quickly inflict a thorough blow on the Chinese military and cause them to lose their will to fight. If China still does not reflect and stubbornly resists, then Japan will not hesitate to continue the battle. Foreign Minister Hirota, in his speech, after describing the course of Sino-Japanese relations, concluded that Japan is seeking the harmony and cooperation of Japan, China, and "Manchukuo" in order to build a stable foundation for East Asia. What Japan hopes for is to clarify North China and to ensure that China as a whole will not have to worry about such wars again. To readjust national relations and realize national goals, I sincerely hope that Chinese politicians will understand the overall situation in East Asia and reflect on their actions as soon as possible to adapt to Japan's ideals. Land Minister Sugiyama, after reporting on the war situation, said that even if China were to engage in a protracted war of resistance, Japan would thoroughly punish it. Before China diminishes its anti-Japanese consciousness and loses its will to fight, and before Japan's goals are achieved, it cannot cease military operations. Naval Minister Yonai's speech was roughly the same. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota met with foreign journalists this afternoon and issued a statement, the main points of which are as follows: The fundamental cause of the Sino-Japanese incident is that Chinese leaders used the cultivation of anti-Japanese sentiment as a tool to achieve their political goals, and used diplomatic incidents to enhance their prestige. As a result, they reached a compromise with the Communist Party and publicly engaged in active war preparations against Japan. The non-aggression treaty recently signed between China and the Soviet Union has special significance. Japan cannot remain indifferent in order to prevent the Communist Party from invading East Asia. However, if China expresses its sincerity and reconsiders and changes its attitude towards Japan, Japan will, as in the past, prepare to recall its expeditionary forces and join hands with China. However, the Japanese people cannot tolerate the recurrence of such tragic events, and the situation has reached an extremely serious level. We are determined to move forward with our established policy until a fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese incident can be achieved. In short, China and Japan are neighbors and have had friendly relations since ancient times. It is not difficult to realize the ideal of coexistence and co-prosperity. However, for the sake of peace in East Asia and the world, I cannot hide my enthusiasm. I hope that China will reconsider its policy towards Japan, and at the same time, in order to restore peace as soon as possible, I also invite other countries to cooperate with Japan and avoid taking any actions that would prolong the current hostile behavior.

<h3>Japanese Consul in Qingdao Lowered Flag and Returned to Country</h3>
<p>Mayor Shen Saw Him Off</p>
<p>[Qingdao] Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Japanese residents in Shandong Province, including Japanese women and children in Qingdao, have been successively evacuated. More than 5,000 of their able-bodied men also began to withdraw on August 28th. At the same time, the Japanese consulate requested the Chongqing government to protect the property of Japanese residents. After negotiations between the two parties, it was agreed that the Japanese side would seal up all factories, shops, institutions, and residences themselves, and we would only protect public order from the outside. We are not responsible for the safekeeping of the property inside. We are not responsible for any losses caused by natural disasters or incidents, or by military operations caused by Japanese military attacks on Qingdao and its vicinity. The Japanese consulate will also provide a list of the locations of factories, shops, and residences to the municipal government for future reference. At about 9:00 a.m. on the 4th, Japanese Consul Ohtaka gathered more than 100 Japanese residents in front of the consulate to perform a flag-lowering ceremony. At that time, many Japanese people present shed tears. After the ceremony, Ohtaka and others went to the municipal government to say goodbye, and then boarded the Haruna Maru. Mayor Shen also went to the dock to see them off. Staff members of the consulate, naval liaison officers, and employees of Sino-Japanese joint ventures all returned to their countries on the same ship.

<h3>One Soldier of Our Army Who Defended Nankou Single-Handedly Repelled the Enemy</h3>
<p>Transported Ammunition and Bombed Countless Enemy Soldiers to Death</p>
<p>⊙Guihua: According to people from the front, when our army was defending Nankou, a certain regiment was sacrificed on a certain mountain, leaving only one soldier. He still did not retreat. This soldier was very resourceful and saw that there were still many guns, ammunition, and grenades left, which would soon be seized by the enemy. Therefore, he used his own strength to transport them back and forth and piled them up at the enemy's invasion site, and connected the guns and bullets with a fuse. Soon, the enemy swarmed up the mountain, vying to seize the pile. This soldier ambushed in the trench, and when the enemy approached, he quickly lit the fuse. In an instant, the ammunition exploded, and countless enemies were killed and wounded and fled down the mountain, not daring to invade again. A certain army commander learned of this situation and greatly praised the soldier's resourcefulness.

<h3>Foreign Military Expert Describes Impressions of Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Believes That Japan's Use of Heavy Troops in Shanghai is a Mistake</p>
<p>[Nanjing] A foreign military expert recently came to Nanjing from Shanghai and shared his impressions of the Sino-Japanese War in Shanghai over the past two weeks with reporters at his hotel. He first stated that Japan's simultaneous use of heavy and精兵 in Shanghai while fiercely attacking North China was a mistake. His reason was that, historically speaking, Japan's armed aggression against China generally avoided full-scale war. For example, during the September 18th Incident, Japan concentrated its forces on Manchuria. During the January 28th Incident, it concentrated its forces on Shanghai, without involving other places. During the Great Wall Campaign the following year, it limited the scope of the attack to a corner of northern Hebei. This was all done by taking advantage of China's weakness and division at the time to carry out local military occupation. This type of offensive strategy can be said to be active and has achieved important victories. However, the current situation proves that Japan has had to reverse its past course and simultaneously launch military operations in North China and the coastal provinces. From this, it can be seen that Japan has at least two weaknesses: first, it was forced to abandon its original strategy and extend the front line beyond its intentions; second, it urgently requires a quick victory, which reflects its vulnerability to a protracted war. As for the actual strength of the Japanese army in Shanghai, according to the expert, it is not to be underestimated. At least 70,000 Japanese army personnel are currently there, including the most精悍 of the Kurume Division, which is the former Japanese teaching division. Most of the mechanized units in the current Japanese divisions originated from this division. In terms of the navy, no less than seventy large and small warships have been concentrated there, with a total of nearly seven hundred cannons on board. In addition, the air force has more than 200 new-style planes for bombing, reconnaissance, and combat. With such a large and精锐 armed force, the combined offensive of the army, navy, and air force is clearly aimed at landing on a large scale in a very short period of time, breaking through a point in China's defensive network, and implementing the so-called central breakthrough strategy. However, at the beginning of the Shanghai War, the Chinese army fiercely resisted from Zhabei and Hongkou, causing the Japanese army's long-prepared land battle positions in that direction to lose their effectiveness. Subsequently, it repeated the old trick of the January 28th Incident, attempting to land in Liuhang, but also failed. It then shifted its main force to the lower reaches of the Huangpu River, intending to open a bloody path in Wusong, Yunzaobang, and Zhanghuabang to allow a large number of army personnel to land, build positions, and deploy modern weapons such as tanks and armored vehicles. However, every time it reached a place, it was severely attacked by the Chinese army. Although a considerable number of troops were able to land in some locations under the cover of strong artillery fire, they ultimately failed to achieve their goal of deep penetration. On the contrary, the "landing surface" of the Japanese army has gradually expanded, such as Chuansha, Liulin, Yuepu, and Baoshan, serving as targets for our army to seize the opportunity to break through. Regardless of individual combat results, the fact that this "landing surface" has expanded proves the success of the Chinese army's resistance. At least until now, there is no doubt that the Japanese army's chance for a "central breakthrough" has not yet been obtained. The fierce counterattack by the Chinese army on the 2nd and 3rd of this month has further reduced the possibility of obtaining this opportunity. The expert concluded that the improvement of the Chinese army's strategy and tactics in recent years was indeed expected, but what it has shown this time is truly amazing. At the same time, without China's unity and overall progress in recent years, it would not have been possible to create today's great turning point. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th)</p>
<h3>Foreign Military Officer Talks About Exaggerated Japanese Propaganda After Passing Through Shanghai from Japan</h3>
<p>Fabricating Victory News to Numb the People; Learned After Arriving in Shanghai That Our Army's Positions Had Not Moved</p>
<p>When the French mail ship Sphinx arrived in Shanghai from Kobe the day before yesterday, it carried a large number of Europeans and Americans who had departed from Japan and were returning to their countries. According to their statements to reporters when they passed through Shanghai, when they were in Japan, they were deceived by the Japanese news policy and thought that Shanghai had already been occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese people in their country used exaggerated news to publicize their victory in the war in China. But when the ship we were on sailed into the Wusongkou, we realized that what the Japanese propaganda was saying was the opposite of the truth. As a result of the heroic resistance of the Chinese garrison in the Wusongkou area, the huge number of Japanese army personnel were still floating on the sea, unable to land. The losses suffered by the Japanese side's property in the Yangshupu area due to the attacks by the Chinese army's artillery fire, as well as the seriousness of the threat to the Japanese army's defenses, are enough to show the embarrassment of Japan in this war. Currently, all of Japan's important standing armies have been sent to China to fight. Currently, all of the transportation tools in the country, such as railways and ships, have also been requisitioned for military use. In addition, the government has ordered all employees of various industrial and commercial enterprises related to the war and military supplies to extend their working hours in order to increase their aggressive power. On the contrary, it clearly reveals its dire situation. However, Japan has now fallen into the frenzy of war. Every day, we only see the departure of huge amounts of troops and the transportation of huge amounts of weapons of war. Japanese newspapers are engaging in various provocative propaganda from the side. They seem to unanimously believe that China will be defeated with one blow and that Japan will have an absolute chance of victory. In their newspapers, the daily headlines are either "Suzhou Has Fallen, Nanjing Is Under Threat" or "200 Chinese Military Aircraft Have Been Shot Down" or "The Entire ×× Division of the Chinese Army Has Been Annihilated," exaggerating the facts and distorting the truth. Under the propaganda of such exaggerated news, the large team of Japanese troops left their wives and children with tears and bitter smiles and slowly headed towards China. According to the passengers, after we left Japan, it was like walking out of a dim and confused atmosphere. When the ship we were on sailed into the Wusongkou and reached the Fushupu River, we realized that the Chinese army's positions in Beizhan were still standing, and the Chinese army's positions in Pudong were still using heavy artillery shells from time to time to attack the backs of the Japanese army, posing a major threat to them.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warlords Compete for Territory, Infighting Becomes More Intense</h3>
<p>Reactionary Officers All Dismissed; Konoe Ridiculed by Elementary School Students</p>
<p>A Certain Faction of Military Personnel Revolts</p>
<p>Tokyo Secret News: The current Japanese warlords are just like the Chinese warlords in the 7th and 8th years of the Republic of China. Each takes getting territory as their expansionary mission. Considering Japan only has the superintendency of Korea, the directorship of Taiwan, the Kwantung Army of the Northeast, and the garrison army in North China, the territories are insufficient for their distribution. Thus, the Shanghai battle is clearly intended for the military factions to get more territory. There are many internal parties within the Japanese military, and the infighting between them is very intense. Since the May 15th and February 26th incidents, the violence of the military personnel has been gradually exposed and has become increasingly unscrupulous. Unexpectedly, only one week after the start of the battle in Shanghai, a certain faction of the Japanese military suddenly had a conspiracy to revolt. But the opportunity was not secret, and it was detected by the authorities, who arrested a group of people, and this major event was thus reduced to nothing. Currently, the Japanese government is absolutely secretive to the outside world, so there is no way to know the truth of this matter. There is one thing that can prove this fact from the side, that is, on August 14, the Minister of the Army suddenly dismissed the Superintendent of Military Education of the Army, the Commander of the Konoe Division, and other four important military officers, and appointed new people. But the whereabouts of these dismissed people are unknown. There seems to be a secret existence. From the clues, it is not difficult for us to explore a glimpse of this major event.</p>
<p>The People Bitterly Resent the Government</p>
<p>Tokyo News: Since the military department began its armed aggression in Lugou Bridge and Shanghai, panic has suddenly arisen in the market here. On the streets and alleys, only demobilized soldiers are seen flaunting their power. All kinds of careers have come to a standstill. Therefore, the people all resent the government. But under high pressure, they all dare to be angry but dare not speak out. If someone makes peaceful remarks or writes non-war texts, they will be arrested by the headquarters of the military police. In addition to the economic exploitation of the people by the government, their mental suffering is even more unbearable. The grievances that these people have no way to vent are all used in anonymous letters to scold the government. Therefore, important government officials receive a large number of anonymous letters every day, especially the Prime Minister and the Minister of the Army. The Japanese people all use postcards, so their content is easily leaked out in the post office. The text of most anonymous postcards is to accuse important people of warmongering, and they often move them to commit seppuku to apologize to the people. An elementary school student sent a postcard to Konoe. The content was extremely humorous, saying: "Fighting a bitter battle with China, there are only failures and no victories. I advise you to practice golf more instead of training. After you become proficient in golf, declare war on China again." Konoe is just a dandy who knows nothing but golf.</p>
<h3>Relief and Condolence News</h3>

<h3>Brief Report on Sending Away Refugees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee yesterday sent 5,400 refugees in three batches to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Jiaxing. The supply group provided food to the refugees today.</p>
<p>The Yunnan Students Association in Shanghai, recognizing the tense situation and to facilitate members' return to their hometowns, specifically withdrew a portion of its funds to provide travel expenses. Yesterday, an urgent notice was issued (details in this newspaper's advertisement).

Up to the day before yesterday, approximately 2,000 refugees had been sent directly to their hometowns, and the journey was very safe. Because the previous registration period was rushed, there may still be omissions. Therefore, starting today, registration will continue. Any Jingjiang fellow villagers wishing to return home by boat can quickly register at No. 15 Ping'an Lane, Zhehua Road, inside the association.</p>
<p>The Cixi Sojourners Association in Shanghai has been transporting fellow villagers to Hangzhou for their return home for several days.

<h3>Establishing Inland National Defense Industries</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>During this all-out war of resistance, there is a clear need for our country's industry to make overall plans and seek comprehensive promotion. The China, Central, Communications, and Farmers Banks recently established a joint office and set up joint lending committees in fifteen inland locations. On August 31, the Executive Yuan also passed standards for reviewing interest subsidies for special industries (i.e., industries related to military supplies). Although these measures cannot yet be called industrial mobilization for a wartime economy, they are sufficient to enhance the national defense significance of our country's industry. If they can be effectively implemented, not only will our long-term war effort be supported, but also a portion of the industry left standing after the artillery fire can become the foundation for future industrial reconstruction. If our country's industrialists can all engage in the development of national defense industries under this national policy, they can gradually create a wartime organization for industry. Now, let's provide a more concrete explanation of the interest subsidy regulations.</p>
<p>Article 3 of the regulations stipulates that the government should determine the interest subsidies for special industries based on actual needs. There are many industrial sectors related to military supplies. If the government subsidizes and provides interest subsidies to all of them, it will not only be unable to meet the urgency and quantity of military needs, but it will also be difficult to handle them all at once, and it is also unnecessary. Considering the circumstances and determining based on needs will effectively avoid unnecessary financial consumption during a war when government expenditures are heavy.</p>
<p>The regulations also stipulate that the location of any factory applying for interest subsidies or subsidies must first be reviewed and decided. This article is particularly important. Currently, many industries related to military affairs are located in coastal ports or areas without military defenses. Enemy planes can easily destroy them. In the future, these types of industries should be established according to government-designated locations, which will ensure safety. This will benefit both national defense and investment.</p>
<p>Article 6 of the regulations stipulates that the duration of interest subsidies for special industries should be determined based on the needs of each industry. This point further demonstrates the government's determination to support industry. It must be understood that military needs and related industries not only require large amounts of capital but also have slow capital turnover and cannot be profitable in the short term. If the government does not subsidize these industries or provide interest subsidies, private industrialists may be daunted. Now that the duration of interest subsidies has been extended, private capital will be happy to invest, even if profits are difficult to achieve in the short term.</p>
<p>Now that the government has precise plans for the construction of national defense industries, all industrialists with even a little patriotism should make good use of their funds to strive for the country's final victory. Establishing national defense industries inland can not only support the war of resistance but also lay the permanent foundation for our country's industry. Compared to hoarding wealth and relying on foreign forces, focusing solely on personal plans, the merit or fault of these actions towards the country is vastly different.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Agree to Convene Mediterranean Security Conference</h3>
<p>Twelve Countries Invited to Participate, to be Held in Nyon, Switzerland</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the French government's proposal to hold a conference of Mediterranean coastal countries, Britain and France have recently reached complete agreement and will issue a statement to explain it later this month. Today, they will jointly invite Italy, Albania, Yugoslavia, Greece, and Turkey to send representatives to participate. The conference will be convened near Geneva during the League of Nations regular session (the Executive Yuan is scheduled to meet on the 10th of this month, and the General Assembly is scheduled to meet on the 13th). (Central News Agency, Havana, 5th)</p>
<p>[London] According to responsible sources, the Mediterranean conference will likely be held in Nyon, Switzerland, located on Lake Geneva, between Geneva and Lausanne. Participants will include Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Egypt, Albania, Romania, Bulgaria, and the Soviet Union, totaling twelve countries. Although the Soviet Union, Germany, and other Black Sea coastal countries are not Mediterranean coastal countries, they have also been invited to participate because these countries' relations are very important to Mediterranean shipping. Allowing them to participate in the conference is intended to mutually protect traveling ships and achieve practical results. Regarding this matter, after Foreign Secretary Eden and French Foreign Minister Delbos spoke by telephone, it is reported that Britain and France have reached an agreement and will issue a statement tonight to announce it. As for the agenda of the Mediterranean conference, political figures claim that it will not only include the issue of defending against submarine attacks but also the issue of airplane bombings. The British plan to restrict submarine navigation in the Mediterranean has been endorsed by the French government. Once the Mediterranean conference approves this plan, Britain and France will submit it to the Spanish Republican government and the Nationalist authorities. If both sides are unwilling to accept it voluntarily, they will be forced to accept it. Therefore, after the agreement is established by the countries attending the Mediterranean conference, any submarine found sailing outside the designated area will be sunk immediately.

<h3>German Social Democratic Party to Hold Regular Congress</h3>
<p>Hitler to Personally Receive Ambassadors, Review Party, Government, and Military Representatives in Batches</p>
<p>[Berlin] The National Socialist Party's annual congress is scheduled to be held next week, lasting eight days. Representatives from the national party, government, and military will be reviewed in batches by the leader, Hitler, as in previous years. However, the biggest event this year is the upcoming visit of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to Germany. The true significance of this congress lies in this. It has been observed that the National Socialist Party has not achieved any significant achievements in diplomacy in the past year, which is the opposite of previous years. For example, regarding the Spanish Civil War, although Germany has established close ties with Spanish Fascism, the results have not been as quick as Germany had expected. On the contrary, the European situation has become increasingly dark. However, the anti-communist declaration made by Leader Hitler at the last National Socialist Party congress has been echoed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, who stated that Bolsheviks should be driven out of the Mediterranean. As for the matter of the Italian leader's visit to Germany, the National Socialist Party authorities can use this opportunity to divert the German people's various concerns about domestic affairs. Since the four-year economic plan was announced at last year's National Socialist Party congress, the authorities and the people have worked very hard, but as far as the current situation is concerned, even if there are some concrete achievements, they are not as obvious as the suffering caused by the people's frugality. Air Minister, namely the dictator of the Four-Year Plan, General Goering, recently gave a speech to the overseas Chinese representatives' congress, saying that if there is not enough food in the country, he will immediately implement a food rationing system based on population. In fact, this method has always been viewed with disdain by the general public, but General Goering mentioned it without hesitation, and its meaning is extremely worthy of pondering. According to the national grain harvest statistics, although the authorities have taken various regulatory measures, it is still not enough to supply the people's food needs. Meat is also in short supply. Economics Minister Dr. Schacht recently published an article in the Minben magazine, which also explained the bleak situation of the German economy in accordance with General Goering's speech, saying that we now have two tasks: one is to obtain food, and the other is to replenish military equipment. Anything else is secondary. Schacht explained the crisis of the inflation policy, saying that as of the end of July this year, the amount of paper money in circulation has reached 7,000,000,000 marks, which is the highest amount since Germany stopped its expansion policy after the Great War. Judging from the above-mentioned situations, it is to be expected that the German National Socialist Party authorities will take advantage of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Germany to promote to the domestic public opinion that the government has a great deal to accomplish in diplomacy, so as to conceal its internal difficulties. (Central News Agency, Havana, 4th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] An official communiqué was recently issued stating that when the National Socialist Party's annual congress opens in Nuremberg next week, envoys from various countries will be personally received by Leader Hitler. Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang, British Ambassador Henderson, French Ambassador Poncet, Italian Ambassador Attolico, as well as the ambassadors from Japan, Poland, Chile, Argentina, Turkey, and Brazil, and the ambassador sent by the Spanish Nationalist government, have all accepted the Leader's invitation. However, Soviet Ambassador Suritz and Vatican Ambassador Orsenigo have both declined. The United States will be represented by Chargé d'Affaires Gilbert. The German government has prepared two special trains, and the envoys from various countries will be housed and fed on the special trains. (Central News Agency, 4th) [Washington] U.S. Ambassador to Germany Dodd recently said that after returning home on leave, the embassy's Chargé d'Affaires, Lee Gilbert, accepted the invitation of German Leader Hitler and decided to go to Nuremberg to attend the German National Socialist Party's annual congress. Dodd was quite dissatisfied when he heard about this. (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull said today that the government is paying close attention to the peace agreement proposed by German Leader Hitler among the United States, Britain, and Germany. This proposal was seen in a letter from Hitler to Lord Rothermere, published by the London Daily Mail. Hull also said that the U.S. representative in Germany, Gilbert, has been ordered to attend the German National Socialist Party's congress, although there has been much criticism. Hull said that there is no discord in the diplomatic relations between the United States and Germany. Almost all other countries have accepted this invitation, so how can the United States be different? As for the rumors that German officials advocated that Germans living abroad should be allowed to participate in the activities of the National Socialist Party, Hull said that the State Department has not received this information, and he said that when foreigners become citizens, they have already sworn to uphold the U.S. political system, so there is no such worry.

<h3>Mussolini's Visit to Germany Causes Various Speculations</h3>
<p>Police from Both Countries Deployed for Protection, German and Italian Newspapers Have Different Views</p>
<p>[Berlin] The semi-official political and diplomatic news agency recently published an article on the upcoming visit of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating, "The visit of the Italian Prime Minister has a significance far beyond a simple visit. However, other countries do not need to feel threatened and uneasy because of this. In the current dangerous period in European politics, the cooperation between Germany and Italy is an element of security and stability. The political axis formed by Germany and Italy does not intend to divide Europe, but only benefits true peace, and has no intention of seeking hegemony, but is realistic and recognizes the needs related to the survival of all nations." (Central News Agency, Havana, 4th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding Prime Minister Mussolini's upcoming visit to German Leader Hitler, the Prime Minister's mouthpiece, the famous journalist Gayda, recently published an article in the Italian Daily commenting on this, stating that the Prime Minister's trip is by no means surprising. "If the new system promoted by Germany and Italy is attacked by any party, each country will defend it with all its strength, but there is no intention of isolating themselves. Germany and Italy do not reject international cooperation, and the only thing they reject and cooperate with is Bolshevism. In addition, there is one thing that must be explained immediately, that is, Italy does not have any pro-British or pro-German leanings, because Italy can establish an agreement with another country after establishing an agreement with one country." (Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Italian Police Chief Bocchini recently went to Berlin to discuss security issues during the visit of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini with the German police authorities. Bocchini has recently returned home, but there is still no agreement on the procedures for receiving Mussolini. It is rumored that German Leader Hitler invited Mussolini to attend the National Socialist Party congress in Nuremberg, but it is heard that Mussolini, in view of the current tense relations between the Vatican and Germany, does not want to attend the National Socialist Party congress, lest he hurt the feelings of the Vatican, so he would rather go to Germany after the National Socialist Party congress is over. In addition, according to some Italian politicians, the procedures for the future talks between Mussolini and Hitler will depend on the situation of the League of Nations Council and General Assembly meetings.

<h3>Foreigners Sympathize with Our Country</h3>
<p>Letters of Encouragement to Soldiers and Generous Gifts of Comfort Items</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Li, a member of the Wuxi Native Association's rescue team in Shanghai, was passing near the Jing'an Temple Road Yu Yuan Road post office when a Westerner, noticing Mr. Li's armband, entrusted him with a package. The cover was written in Western script, which the association translated as follows: "Two bedsheets, one lunchbox, and one water bottle are presented with utmost sincerity to the brave and respectable soldiers who are working hard on the front lines for the nation and giving voice to the 400 million Chinese people. We wish you an early trip to Tokyo to kill the Japanese, the evil warlords who are disturbing world peace. If convenient, please bring the head of a Japanese beast soldier to your friend—me—to play with. Long live the great Chinese nation! Long live world peace! Sincerely, Smith Olin."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Mr. Tan Fude (transliteration), an American resident in Shanghai, personally visited the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai on Yu Qiaqing Road yesterday and donated a box of soda crackers for the refugees in the association's shelter to alleviate their hunger. Mr. Liang Zhuoren, the supply officer of the association, expressed his gratitude for the enthusiasm of the foreign resident. It has been noted that the association has recently received several donations and words of comfort from foreigners, which is truly admirable.</p>

<h3>National Goods Factory Association Requests Issuance of Circulation Vouchers</h3>
<p>For Domestic Circulation and Exchange of Goods, with a Provisional Issuance of 500 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Association submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Regarding the urgent need to address economic difficulties in this extraordinary time, we request that the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China be instructed to issue circulation vouchers to regulate wartime finance and maintain production resources. Since the outbreak of war in Shanghai, [...] for the purpose of rescuing production, maintaining workers' livelihoods, and focusing on wartime economic resources, the association convened a meeting. It was unanimously agreed that to regulate wartime finance, facilitate market circulation, and prevent a shortage of funds, the only option is to request the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to issue circulation vouchers in denominations of 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan, circulating throughout the country, only for the exchange of goods, not for the exchange of legal tender. Industrial and commercial operators should be allowed to use movable and immovable property as full collateral, and the mortgaged movable and immovable property will serve as reserves. Redemption should be allowed on a regular basis, and the interest rate should not exceed four percent. The price of all collateral should be publicly assessed by an evaluation committee. The total issuance of these circulation vouchers is provisionally set at 500 million yuan, to be concluded within one year after the end of the war. The issuance regulations should be stipulated by the Ministry of Finance and promulgated by order." The resolution to submit the petition has been recorded. It is appropriate to record the case and submit a written petition, hoping that Your Ministry will review and implement it, and we humbly await your instructions with utmost anticipation.</p>
<h3>A Nighttime Inspection of the Battlefield</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>(Special Report from Our Newspaper) The day before yesterday evening, this reporter made another trip to inspect the front lines in the Wusong area. At 4 PM, two cars departed from Shanghai. The first car was a Boy Scout rescue team with two "serving the country and not seeking fame" driver friends, Zhang Genbao and Zhu Quansheng. They were originally workers at the Hua Fu Hat Factory. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, they volunteered to go to the front lines to do transportation work for a certain unit. As the car passed a certain intersection in Nanshi, they bought a bag of steamed buns to eat, and Mr. Pan Yunde, who was in the same car with me, said: "They are also paying for themselves out of their own pockets!" In the second car, besides me and Mr. Pan, there was also Miss Ye Mingyan, a student from Zhijiang University, who was also indignant at the invasion by the brutal Japanese and wanted to go to the front lines to participate in the actual work of resistance.</p>
<p>We had just circled from South Shanghai to West Shanghai when we gradually heard the sound of machines, coming from far away. Mr. Zhang in the front car held up four fingers, and we immediately understood that four enemy planes were coming to "see us off." Seeing the situation, it was indeed unfavorable, so we quickly stopped the car in the depths of the green shade, got out of the car and dispersed, waiting in full array. But after their arrival, they did not drop any bombs. After a mutual understanding, we continued on our way.</p>
<p>The village houses and buildings seen along the road, although inevitably with broken beams and rafters and mottled scars, were mostly unchanged from the last few days. What is most heartbreaking is that the Zhenru International Radio Station was newly and severely damaged in several key areas. Looking at the towering water tower, it had suddenly collapsed to the ground, and the sound of dripping water could still be faintly heard. More than ten miles past Dachang, the more than two hundred dairy cows of a certain dairy farm that were killed by the bombing, piles of flesh and blood in the east and piles of bones in the west, were emitting all their stench in the remaining glow of the setting sun. The autumn cicadas on the branches were still humming intermittently, as if crying out their full of sorrow for them, and as if cursing the brutality of the Japanese army!</p>
<p>The magnificent and beautiful city center of the Municipal Government, in the eyes of the enemy planes, which were glaring like tigers, was undoubtedly the most desirable bombing target!</p>
<p>Going further southwest, Fudan University, the highest institution of higher learning in Jiangwan, was also bombed "beyond recognition" by the crazed and brutal enemy artillery fire. It is reported that the entire gymnasium was destroyed, the library's second floor was damaged, the roof of the fourth dormitory was completely bombed, and Zibin College, the first dormitory, and the women's dormitory were all partially damaged; the remaining offices were fortunately unharmed.</p>
<p>Night fell over the earth, and the sound of gunfire also temporarily subsided. But the enemy, having suffered defeats for several days, sent out planes early, sometimes releasing flares that could illuminate a radius of two thousand meters, the brightness of which was even brighter than the autumn moon, the purpose of which was only to scout our artillery positions and the night activities of our infantry. This bomb could light up continuously for four or five minutes. A certain adjutant advised us not to go any further, so we had to hide and change direction to visit General Zhong Song, the commander of a certain brigade, an anti-Japanese hero!</p>
<p>General Zhong looked to be no more than thirty-four or five years old, but his war reports of advancing without retreat for several days and nights in Hongkou, I am afraid that no one would not deeply pay their utmost respect after reading them! Indeed, in those days of bloody battle, our brave soldiers who killed the enemy were either charging forward on a path of blood, or lying in the battlefields where the mud and water reached their waists, risking a hundred deaths to resist the enemy's tanks and artillery. But we must know that without this spirit of hard struggle, we cannot build the foundation of today's overall advantage of the Songhu anti-Japanese war!</p>
<p>After General Zhong pointed to the military map on the wall and told us about the battle situation on each front that day, the reporter wanted to peek at the prospects of the war, so he asked him a question: what are the advantages and disadvantages of the enemy army? He said without hesitation: "Besides the fact that the enemy army has dozens more warships and a few more planes that are making trouble, the rest are their weaknesses." Then he said: "First, the operation in Songhu, is it full of positives or negatives? It is really inconvenient for the enemy's military weapons to operate; second, they have no base, and military supplies are not easy to replenish. For example, the enemy's army soldiers, coming from the three islands by wind and waves, are mostly dizzy. As soon as they enter Wusong, they hear the sound of killing, which will inevitably have a very positive impact on their fighting spirit; third, if they suffer a defeat after landing, they can only jump into the Huangpu River and the Yangtze River. Therefore, we not only have the advantage over the enemy in terms of people and two points, but also the superiority of time and place. We can also bring the enemy to death!" If we objectively reflect on it again, these words are not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Before parting, he greatly praised Miss Ye Mingyan's ambition to participate in the front-line work and specially inscribed the four characters "Chinese Hero" and instructed her to organize a certain special task force and invite her to participate separately by letter. In addition, with equal opportunity, he also inscribed "Be loyal to the country and swear to defend the territory to the death," and gave it to Mr. Pan and the reporter, a spirit of public loyalty and patriotism, as if it could be seen in the lines of the characters.</p>
<p>When returning, because there was a curfew along the way and no lights were allowed to be turned on, it was quite inconvenient to grope on Zhengwan Road. Suddenly, enemy planes fired several flares in the distance, and the driver couldn't help but happily say: "These are not flares, but life-saving bombs!" So we arrived safely in Shanghai very smoothly.</p>
<h3>All Parties Enthusiastically Subscribe to National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>The Total Amount Has Reached 60 Million Yuan, Hu Wenhu Alone Purchased 200,000</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the regulations for soliciting subscriptions for national salvation bonds by the General Association of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee, subscribers from all parties have been extremely enthusiastic. According to the statistics of the General Association, the national salvation bonds received and subscribed for in recent days have reached 60 million yuan.

<p>Hu Wenhu Purchases 200,000</p>
<p>Hu Wenhu, an overseas Chinese businessman in Singapore, has always been enthusiastic about the motherland. Since the full-scale war of resistance broke out, Mr. Hu telegraphed 30,000 yuan to rescue wounded soldiers and refugees. When the central government issued national salvation bonds, it commissioned Mr. Hu as one of the fundraising committee members. After receiving the telegram, Mr. Hu immediately replied to the General Association, first subscribing for 200,000 yuan and vigorously soliciting subscriptions from overseas Chinese. There are many wealthy overseas Chinese like Mr. Hu, and there will be many who will follow suit and contribute generously in the future.</p>
<p>National Doctors Subscribe for 50,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Doctors Association previously decided that the national medical community would subscribe for 50,000 yuan for national salvation bonds. It has now been handed over to the association and forwarded to the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee.</p>
<p>Fundraising by the Glass Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Glass Industry Association held an emergency joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees yesterday and decided to organize a national salvation bond solicitation team. It was decided that Mr. Wang Rongkun, the chairman of the association, would be the team leader. The provisional fundraising target is about 10,000 yuan. Once the target is reached, it will be handed over to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for collection and transfer.</p>
<h3>New Rice Continues to Arrive, Citizens Have Ample Food Supply</h3>
<p>The Municipal Food Mobilization Committee is continuously purchasing hundreds of thousands of piculs of new rice from the interior. Recently, a shipment of Wuhu rice has arrived. Grain merchants in the interior are automatically transporting rice to Shanghai from the production areas in an endless stream. It is estimated that one million piculs of new rice will arrive this month. In addition, the population of Shanghai has decreased by one-tenth. The current population of the city, including Chinese and foreigners, is less than three million. The supply of rice is absolutely no problem. The food supply is abundant, and the price of rice is expected to be balanced at around ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Government Agencies Should Not Lay Off Employees in Extraordinary Times</h3>
<p>To Avoid Increased Unemployment and Exploitation by the Enemy</p>
<p>Yu Chuanding, a member of the Shanghai Education Community National Salvation Association, and others, considering that the brutal Japanese are making all kinds of tricks, using unemployed people in our country to spy on military intelligence and disrupt the rear, resulting in a proliferation of traitors and hidden dangers, have suggested to various public organizations and petitioned the National Government to issue an order to all public and private institutions, groups, and industrial and commercial firms throughout the country to find ways to provide living expenses and maintain the original number of employees during this extraordinary period, and not to implement retrenchment as a way to practice thrift, so as not to be exploited by the enemy and harm society and the country.</p>
<h3>Relief Committee Agrees to Allocate 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>To Relieve Refugees</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the United Relief Association of Charity Organizations in Shanghai has been incurring huge expenses since it began sheltering refugees. Although people from all walks of life have enthusiastically donated, it is still far from sufficient. The association telegraphed the Central Relief Committee to find a way to allocate funds to assist in continuing relief efforts. According to the association's message, the Relief Committee has telegraphed back yesterday, agreeing to find a way to allocate 100,000 yuan for relief, which should arrive in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Solicitation</h3>
<p>Housing, Nursing, Medicines, Clothing and Bedding, Funds, and Members</p>
<p>The entire staff of doctors and nurses at the Sino-Belgian Gu Ding Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospital, considering that there is a lack of well-organized wounded soldier hospitals at sea, have dedicated themselves to obtaining the latest and most complete medical equipment, including X-ray equipment, in order to avoid delays in treating difficult traumas and to preserve the strength of the resistance. In addition to bone surgery experts Huang Jian, Cai Hong, Cai Shoukang, Tang Shiheng, and other doctors, there are also foreign famous doctors such as X-ray expert Fa Si Adis who are willing to participate voluntarily. All doctors have separately raised large sums of money for medical supplies, which have been fully donated by a certain Westerner. This international wounded soldier hospital is generally fully prepared. The only difficulty is that there are still no suitable houses. If any patriotic people have houses in safe areas that can accommodate 300 beds and are willing to provide them for the wounded soldier hospital to borrow (if rent is required, it can also be arranged), please contact Dr. Huang Jian at 5th Floor, Hardoon Building, Nanjing Road, between 5 and 7 PM every day, telephone number 18379.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the city has been shaken, and refugees from the war zone have fled. All wet nurses must feel that their milk supply is insufficient or even cut off due to the lack of food and clothing in this terrifying and abnormal situation. This matter is of great importance to the health of the future masters of the country, and it is especially serious for the future of the people and the nation. It has been learned that Dr. Luo Bu Sheng of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the Chinese Medical Association, and the Health Department of the Public Works Department has immediately united to appeal to all sectors of society to generously donate large amounts of milk powder and fresh milk substitutes, or to fund the employment of wet nurses. It is hoped that enthusiastic women's organizations in Shanghai will take the opportunity to organize infant care and nursing classes and go to various shelters to diligently take on the responsibility of guiding and managing all milk bottles and nipple disinfection hygiene, etc., because most refugees lack common sense and rarely pay attention to the procedures before and after using milk powder and breastfeeding. Ladies should also take this opportunity to start a baby care movement. It has also been learned that a major milk company has agreed to hand over its daily surplus of fresh milk to the association for distribution to various shelters, so it is hoped that all sectors of society will respond to the news and generously donate milk powder or milk substitutes, cod liver oil, etc., to contribute to the cause. In addition, it is difficult for the association to investigate the skin creams that have occurred in various shelters, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will donate glutinous rice flour oil ointment and medicine water, medicines, and hand them over to the Shanghai International Relief Committee, address: Room 123, YMCA Building, Baxianqiao, or the Chinese Medical Association, at 41 Chihama Road, Dr. Luo Bu Sheng at the Health Department of the Public Works Department in Hankou Road.</p>
<p>The Relief of War Zone Refugees Committee of the Cilian Association has more than 30,000 to 40,000 refugees in its shelters, excluding those who are sent away from time to time. As autumn is approaching, the nights are getting cooler. The clothing and bedding collected by the association are far from sufficient. In order to protect the health of the refugees, it is planned to make 20,000 cotton vests and 10,000 cotton quilts, which requires urgent funds. Therefore, it is announced to all sectors of society to provide clothing and food, donate materials, and plan to draw craftsmen from the refugees to sew them.</p>
<p>The teachers and students of the Moore Hall Girls' School on Yu Qiaqing Road, in this time of serious national crisis, have established an extraordinary period service department in the student hall on the first floor. From September 6th, they gather every day from 1 to 5 PM to specialize in making clothes for wounded soldiers and sewing comfort bags, as well as various work to facilitate the refugees. However, there are few people and many things, and new and old classmates are still being sought to participate. The school will also officially start classes on September 20th. The Student Wartime Service Corps was launched by Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau since the outbreak of the Shanghai war and is actively proceeding. It has established branches in the war zone and non-war zone, with dozens of locations. In order to increase strength and expand the organization, a registration office has been established to seek the participation of students from various middle schools and universities in wartime service work. Those who have gone to register in recent days are quite enthusiastic. It has been learned that the registration date is limited to the 6th of this month.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Youth National Salvation Propaganda Corps, initiated by Zhu Feng, Liu Yuanzhao, and others, has been filed with the government authorities. Internal preparations have been completed, and it is planned to depart for the interior to start propaganda work in the near future. In order to concentrate strength and increase the effect of national salvation, it is specially expanding the recruitment of members. Anyone with pure thoughts, enthusiasm for national salvation, and a spirit of hard work is welcome to participate. Register at the corps at No. 167, Davenia Road, Da Tong Road intersection.</p>

Yesterday morning, according to reporters from the Datong News Agency, the company was suddenly notified by the British Consulate in Shanghai that the situation in Xiamen was tight and the Fujian Sea was already a dangerous area, so it ordered the ship to stop going to Fujian. It was found that this ship was the first ship to sail to Fujian since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, so it had sold a lot of passenger tickets in recent days.

<p>The Municipal Water and Gas Company is scheduled to continue to open gas tomorrow, starting from the 6th.

<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the First Special Zone Citizens' Federation of this city sent a letter to the British-owned Water and Gas Company yesterday, stating: "In the case of the Shanghai Restaurant Industry Association, it was reported that the British-owned Water and Gas Company is preparing to resume business on Sunday and supply gas. The water and gas equipment completely contains toxic gas. The water and gas plant of the company is located near Xinlaji Bridge and close to the Chinese-controlled area. Now that stray bullets are flying, if there is an accident, the people of the city will be in great danger. Therefore, we are specially writing to your association to negotiate according to law and temporarily suspend the resumption of business in order to protect the people's lives. We deeply pray that you will consider the importance of the people's lives and temporarily suspend the resumption of business on this day when stray bullets are flying."</p>

Our artillery units also concentrated their firepower with heavy artillery and fiercely bombarded the enemy's positions. At the same time, our troops in the Yuepu and Shizilin areas also advanced towards the flanks of Baoshan.

<p>A Unit of Our Army is Currently Defending Baoshan City to the Death, Reinforcements Have Arrived, Fierce Fighting Today</p>
<p>Baoshan County City, located on the riverside, is difficult to defend and was not originally a military stronghold. However, our garrison has built strong fortifications. Although the enemy has repeatedly reinforced and attacked, they have not succeeded. The day before yesterday (the 4th), enemy troops secretly crossed the river and landed from the Shayulongkou riverbank north of the city, totaling over 400 men. Using a three-dimensional assault with naval, land, and air forces, they fiercely attacked our positions. At the same time, the enemy from the Wusong Paotaiwan area also advanced from the side.

Judging from the enemy's objective, they attempted to advance from the Jun Gong Road and Yinxiang Township areas to connect with the enemy in the Zhanghuabang area. Our army fought bravely, not retreating even with artillery shells and bombs raining down. As soon as the enemy troops approached, they used machine guns to conduct dense sweeping fire. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented. After eight hours of bloody battle, there was no change in our army's line of defense. As of 1 PM, the fighting was still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Enemy in Liuhe Launches Fierce Attack</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Bomb Taicang and Jiading</p>
<p>The enemy in the Liuhe area, under the cover of intense artillery fire since last night, has again launched a fierce attack, attempting to restrain our forces so that the enemy surrounded by us in the Shengju area northeast of Luodian can break out. Our army responded calmly, and the enemy ultimately failed. This morning, multiple enemy aircraft bombed the Taicang and Jiading areas, destroying many civilian houses. Residents in the area are fleeing.</p>
<h3>Our Army Destroys Enemy Armored Ship with Artillery</h3>
<p>Enemy Stealth Attack on Sitang Town Annihilated, Enemy Returns This Morning, We Remain Steadfast</p>
<p>Yesterday evening, the enemy troops in the Wenzaobang area, about four to five hundred men, used two armored ships, towing dozens of small civilian boats, advanced north along the Sitang River north of the Wenzaobang, using mortars and light machine guns to fiercely attack Sitang Town. The garrison of the town, our [missing text] unit, immediately met the attack head-on, fighting fiercely for several hours. Around 3 AM this morning, the enemy's armored ship, which was towing civilian boats, was destroyed by our army's artillery fire. All civilian boats were unable to retreat for a moment, and as a result, almost all of the enemy force was annihilated, with very few survivors. At dawn this morning, enemy warships used artillery fire to suppress our army's positions, attempting to cover the enemy troops in the Wenzaobang area as they returned. Our army remained steadfast, waiting in strict formation. However, as of 8 AM, the enemy troops in the area had not taken any aggressive actions.</p>
<h3>Intense Artillery Battles on the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Enemy in Yangshupu Intends to Connect Zhanghuabang Positions, Intense Artillery Fire, Fierce Battle, Enemy Unable to Hold, Collapses and Retreats</p>
<p>At 3:30 AM this morning, approximately seven to eight hundred enemy troops from the Yangshupu and Shanghai University areas launched a joint attack on our army's positions. Enemy warships in the Huangpu also frequently fired artillery to assist in the battle, attempting to seize the area and complete the north-south connection. However, our heavy troops were stationed there, and they were always on high alert. Therefore, our army immediately divided up and bravely engaged in battle, concentrating machine gun and grenade fire to sweep the area. Our [missing text] artillery team also returned fire fiercely with salvoes. After about two hours of intense fighting, the enemy was still unable to hold and collapsed and retreated to its original positions. Our army did not pursue them. The enemy suffered heavy casualties in this battle, and our army also suffered considerable sacrifices.</p>
<h3>Remnants of the Enemy in Luodian are Isolated</h3>
<p>Repeated Struggles Fail, Resulting in Collapse and Retreat, Our Military Strength is Strong, No Mistakes Will be Made</p>
<p>In the Luodian area, since our army bravely fought the enemy yesterday and occupied the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus station, the surrounded remnants of the enemy are still resisting stubbornly, but their situation is even more isolated. Also, the enemy northwest of Luodian has repeatedly advanced towards the Shenjiaqiao and Caowangmiao areas over the past two days, attempting to break through our Jiading defense line to relieve the siege of Luodian. However, after several attacks, they were met head-on by our army and collapsed and retreated. Although they are currently holding out and awaiting reinforcements, stubbornly resisting, we have divisions of soldiers or more in that area, vowing to never allow the enemy to cross the line.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Counterattack on Jiangwan Road Ends in a Miserable Defeat</h3>
<p>One Armored Tank Captured by Us, As of This Morning, Both Sides Defend Their Original Positions</p>
<p>On Jiangwan Road, Baziqiao, Qingyunqiao, and the Hongkou area, since the enemy once launched an all-out stealth attack on Baziqiao, Qingyunqiao, and our army's defenses on the evening of the 3rd and the morning of the 4th, and was severely wounded and collapsed, the enemy in Yangshupu was again bombarded by our [missing text] artillery team at noon on the 4th. Therefore, in recent days, the enemy troops on the entire front line have been deeply worried that our army will take the opportunity to attack. At night, they often use a very small number of troops to launch stealth attacks and harass the front line. Our army, seeing through their plan, pretended not to notice, waiting for them to get close before launching a sudden and painful attack. Seeing that they had been defeated, the enemy became panicked and hurriedly used trench mortars, small steel cannons, and machine guns to indiscriminately fire wildly, in order to prevent our advance. However, our army remained calm and did not move, only giving them a major retaliation when the opportunity arose. Yesterday morning, the enemy troops again led infantry with three armored vehicles to attack our positions. They were met head-on by our army, using machine guns, direct-firing cannons, and trench mortars to bombard the enemy tanks. One of them was captured by us, and the other two were wounded and fled back. The entire enemy army also fled in disarray. As of this morning, both sides are still defending their original positions, facing off and holding each other in check.</p>
<h3>Pudong Defense Line is Solid, No Worries</h3>
<p>Although the Enemy Attempts to Land Day and Night, They are All Repelled</p>
<p>The enemy's attempt to land in Pudong was indeed the result of extremely secret planning, so their attack was also all-out. After failing in the fierce artillery battle on the afternoon of the 4th, their ambitions have not diminished. Two or three small boats often appear on the surface of the Huangpu River, occasionally firing a few shots at the shore from a distance before quietly fleeing. At the same time, enemy warships and aircraft also frequently bombard the area, hoping to achieve a stealthy landing. However, our army's deployment is tight, not only does the enemy have no chance to take advantage of, but their entire army is wiped out and returns in disgrace. However, the enemy, seeing the failure of the battle in the Song district over the past three weeks and suffering heavy losses, and the later reinforcements being crammed onto warships without room to move, has never given up its attempts on Pudong, and there is an urgent need to plan. Therefore, enemy aircraft and warships have been constantly dispatched to bombard in recent days, but our army's positions are solid and the defense is tight, the enemy's attempt is just wishful thinking.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese army sent troops to the Chunjiang Wharf, attempting to attack Pudong. After our army bravely engaged in close combat, the fierce fighting stopped at 7 PM that night. Their attempt to land ultimately failed. The enemy's ambition has been slightly reduced after this blow, so the situation in the past two days has turned calm. However, after 10 PM last night, several enemy warships anchored in Yangshupu again bombarded the area south of Yangjing in Pudong, without any target. Our army is aware of their strategy. This kind of bluffing is nothing more than wanting to prevent our Pudong army from taking action against the Japanese warships, so they use artillery fire as a demonstration. Therefore, our army also fired a few cannons in return, and sometimes ignored them. The enemy's artillery fire was intermittent, stopping only after dawn. Our side did not suffer any damage from the shells fired overnight. At about 7 AM in the morning, four enemy aircraft came to Pudong to circle and reconnoiter, and flew away half an hour later.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Refugees Again Today</h3>
<p>Dropping Over Forty Bombs in the City Center</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at about 7 AM this morning, enemy aircraft appeared over the Beixinjing area again and dropped a bomb on Pears Road. At that time, refugees fleeing to the concession from Beixinjing were passing through the area, resulting in six deaths and two injuries.</p>
<p>Also, from 4 to 6 PM last night, enemy aircraft dropped bombs southwest of Liuhang and southeast of the city center. Bombs fell near the Northern Railway Station, Bazilu, and Hesketh Road. A large fire broke out north of the Ward Road Prison (on or near Airlie Court Road). At 7:30 AM this morning, four enemy aircraft dropped bombs over the Hongqiao area and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in the northwest of the concession. From 7:30 to 8 AM, enemy aircraft bombed the city center again, dropping over forty bombs. Another fire broke out northwest of the Hongkou Fire Brigade, and the fire was quite intense. The large fire north of the Ward Road Prison had not been extinguished by 9 AM.</p>
<h3>Izumo Flagship Sails to Songkou</h3>
<p>Opening Fire on Pudong and Yinxiang Port This Morning</p>
<p>The enemy flagship Izumo quietly sailed away from the No. 2 buoy opposite the Gonghexiang Wharf last night and anchored in Songkou to command the enemy warships in combat. (Another report) Between 10 and 11:30 PM last night, Japanese warships in the Huangpu River and our field artillery team at the [missing text] opened fire on each other. At about 5:15 AM this morning, a Japanese destroyer opened fire on our army in the Pudong area. The ship was anchored about half a mile from the Bund, and the artillery fire did not stop until 6:30 AM. The Izumo and at least seven other Japanese warships have left their anchorage yesterday and were heading downstream. From 8 to 9 AM this morning, Japanese warships opened fire from the Huangpu River, their targets unknown. From 9 to 11 AM, the Izumo and other warships (about five miles downstream in the Huangpu River) opened fire on the Yinxiang Port racecourse area.</p>

<h3>Short Comments</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>To save the country with five yuan seems a bit too easy. People are blaming their people for the added burden of 200 million yen, used to invade our territory and harm our compatriots. We are only raising 500 million yuan in national salvation bonds, only one-fourth of that. Compared to that, we seem a bit inadequate. But their bond raising is like draining the pond to catch the fish, while our bond raising is like taking something out of a pocket. How? It is what we call the “Five Yuan Save the Country Movement.”</p>
<p>The method is for various organizations, shops, factories, and neighborhood residents to contact each other, supervise and encourage each other, gathering their members, employees, and residents. Either each person or each household uses five yuan as a unit to purchase national salvation bonds. The amount depends on the strength of each person’s patriotism and the thickness of their financial resources, without any coercion. The recognized amount can be delivered directly to the bank by the subscriber, or they can elect representatives to take responsibility for collecting and submitting it. Or follow the Central Savings Society's collection method, submitting the list of amounts pledged to the collecting bank, and then the bank will send staff to collect the funds together. This is most suitable for neighborhood residents, and the bank will not refuse due to a shortage of manpower.</p>
<p>The world knows the severity of the national crisis. Who does not know the way to defeat the enemy? Military strength comes first, followed by financial resources. If we cannot contribute to the battlefield, then this small contribution, doing what is righteous and brave, should not lack its people. We will see the results later.</p>

<h3>Will the Second European War Break Out Soon? (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— By Lieshan, Our European Correspondent</p>
<p>㊀ Is the Spanish Incident the Fuse?</p>
<p>Since the Spanish incident occurred last year, a war atmosphere has permeated Europe. When will the Second European War break out? This is almost a daily concern for the European people. The lines between the two sides in this incident are too clear. Germany and Italy are helping General Franco, while France and Russia are helping the "Popular Front" government. Conflicts over ideology (socialism vs. fascism), economic conflicts (Germany wants to gain the Spanish market), and military-geographical conflicts (Britain and Italy vying for dominance in the Mediterranean) have made the situation more serious and complex. If the Spanish incident were truly an internal Spanish matter, it would have been resolved long ago, with no reason for international disputes. However, the backstage bosses are giants on the international political stage. We cannot imagine Mussolini and Hitler allowing General Franco to fail. Similarly, we cannot believe that France, Russia, and even Britain would not use their power to maintain the existence of the "Popular Front" government. A fascist Spain made in Italy would change the current situation in Europe. Conversely, a socialist Spain would indirectly frustrate the momentum of Mussolini and Hitler. Spain, while not the final battleground for both sides, is a prelude to their final battle. Who is willing to give way? Mussolini, Hitler, Stalin, Léon Blum, or even Chamberlain?</p>
<p>Pessimistic? Naturally, in this situation, who can be optimistic! Recently, the only politician who has advised the people to be at ease is South African Prime Minister Hertzog. However, according to his explanation, the reason why war is not likely to break out in Europe at present is not because the countries are particularly friendly, but because everyone is excessively afraid of each other, resulting in no one daring to make the first move. British Foreign Secretary Eden is even less optimistic. He once told a foreign minister in private that "over the years, he has become an easy person to satisfy." He said: "The current situation may not have any hope of improving, but it has not deteriorated further. He feels that this alone is a reason to be satisfied."</p>
<p>▲ Is Mussolini Crazy? The person that most Europeans are most terrified of at present is naturally Mussolini. Two years ago, when everyone was cursing Hitler, many praised him as a pragmatic statesman. His tough and firm attitude towards the Austrian issue had gained material sympathy from Britain and France. At that time, the French government sent him an African colony as a New Year's gift. However, during the invasion of Abyssinia, Mussolini had already revealed his fierce nature, a fierce nature that, at least in the eyes of the British, could not be tolerated. When the Spanish incident broke out, he and Hitler were both the masterminds behind General Franco? Italian planes, artillery, tanks, and even Italian troops are playing a major role in the Spanish Civil War. Initially, Mussolini said that all this news was fabricated by foreign newspapers. Later, however, the official Italian newspapers formally published a list of Italian soldiers who died in the Spanish Civil War, considering these people to be heroes who sacrificed for their cause. Since Mussolini's attitude became public, everyone has wanted to know to what extent Mussolini intends to go. Mussolini once answered in an article: "To solve the Spanish problem, Franco must achieve the final victory!" Judging from past experience, he is not a person who easily yields. Italy is under his sole rule, and he is a "man of his word." Since Italy is willing to use force to back General Franco, the possibility of a second European war breaking out is naturally greater. We only need to see the recent withdrawal of the German and Italian fleets from naval patrols off the coast of Spain, and at the same time, they proposed the following in the London "Non-Intervention Committee": First, all countries recognize Franco as a belligerent entity; Second, abolish the naval patrols by all countries' fleets; Third, maintain the status quo of land surveillance. To put it bluntly, these proposals by Germany and Italy mean that German and Italian arms can still be freely supplied to General Franco by sea, while cutting off the land route for France to supply arms to the "Popular Front" government. Britain and France have expressed that they absolutely cannot accept this proposal. Mussolini's methods are becoming increasingly fierce. People can't help but ask, is he really crazy? It is said that he is not only unwilling to withdraw the 80,000 Italian volunteer soldiers fighting in Spain, but even has preparations to continuously send more troops.</p>
<p>▲ France Can No Longer Give Way? In the Spanish incident, the person with the most tolerance is probably Léon Blum. As a "Popular Front" government, how can France sit idly by and watch General Franco win step by step! But on the other hand, France's policy towards Spain cannot be independent of Britain. As a result, it can only take both sides into account, that is, non-intervention policy to a half, while supplying the "Popular Front" government with armaments also only to a half. However, this attitude of France did not gain the sympathy of all parties. In the eyes of Germany and Italy, France is always as "shameless" as Soviet Russia, helping the Spanish "Red Committee" or "Red Spain" (the name given by Germans and Italians to the "Popular Front" government). International leftists also feel that France is too weak and incompetent, almost indirectly becoming an accomplice to Franco's massacre of the Spanish people. In fact, the predicament of the French is not easily understood by ordinary outsiders.</p>
<p>However, the concessions of the French are limited. Although Léon Blum does not have the arrogant aura of Mussolini, he will never watch the collapse of the Spanish "Popular Front" government. The recent reply from the French diplomatic authorities to Germany and Italy is very clear. That is, once the non-intervention policy fails, France will open its border and allow arms to freely enter Spain. According to several British newspapers, France has deployed a large number of aircraft, tanks, artillery, etc. on the Spanish border. As long as the London "Non-Intervention Committee" collapses, these armaments can be transported into Spanish territory in a few hours. At this moment, the French seem to have expressed their determination. The people who need to consider carefully now seem to be Mussolini and Hitler. That is to say, after the Second European War breaks out, do they have absolute certainty of victory? If they must take the risk.</p>
<p>▲ The British Countermeasures British Prime Minister Chamberlain advises the British people to maintain a calm mind in the current serious situation. Liberal Party statesman Lloyd George said that this is not difficult, every fish has its calm "static" mind. He criticized Britain's neutral policy as indirectly helping General Franco. Foreign Secretary Eden said that Britain's only hope is to localize the Spanish problem, so as not to cause international disputes. Conservative Party statesman Churchill said that the British, like the Spanish, value the integrity of Spanish territory. Regardless of which side wins, if another country wants to create a military base in Spain, Britain cannot sit idly by. In short, according to the general opinion of British politicians at present, Franco seems to be secondary, the main target is how to deal with his backstage boss - Mussolini.</p>
<p>Chamberlain's so-called calm mind is naturally "adjusting to the wind." Originally, Britain's foreign policy has always been "flexible." Franco has now occupied one-third of Spain. If he really becomes the dictator of Spain, standing shoulder to shoulder with Mussolini and Hitler, wouldn't Britain's position in the Mediterranean be in danger? Britain's current countermeasure is to try to break up the alliance of these three dictators.</p>
<p>Britain's first move is to sever the relationship between Portugal, which has always been under British protection, and Italy, and then let Portugal directly influence Franco, indirectly consolidating Britain's power in Spain (that is, in case Franco wins the final victory). Portugal has always been a small country under the British sphere of influence. This time, due to geographical and ideological reasons, it has helped General Franco, which is why it has a relationship with Italy. Britain is an old master, so this policy immediately had a considerable effect. Recently, Portugal's pro-British tone and General Franco have also expressed their willingness to withdraw all countries' volunteer soldiers in Spain (this is Britain's proposition). Although this "undermining" method is more difficult to realize, it is enough to give Mussolini a big blow.</p>
<p>The second move is to try to break up the marriage between Mussolini and Hitler. According to a British newspaper, Britain has proposed the following exchange conditions to Germany, if Germany is willing to change its attitude towards the Spanish event and not cooperate with Italy:</p>
<p>1. Supply Germany with industrial raw materials.</p>
<p>2. Try to increase Germany's export trade.</p>
<p>3. Britain is willing to grant Germany a large loan.</p>
<p>Germany's economy is currently in a very difficult period, so this proposal is naturally a great temptation. In addition, the results of the test in the Spanish Civil War show that, except for anti-aircraft guns, other German-made weapons are not as sophisticated as those produced by French and Russian arsenals, so Hitler is also at a crossroads. It is said that these two dictators, Germany and Italy, may soon separate. Recently, the slogan of people in the British financial community is: Germany gives the world (Britain) peace, Britain gives loans!</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Raid Nanchang Situation</h3>
<p>Our Air Force Responds and Shoots Down Two Enemy Planes, Traitors Sending Signals Arrested, More Than Sixty People</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, enemy planes have come to the mainland to bomb Nanchang. Nanchang has also been visited by enemy planes several times. However, due to the tight air defense equipment, the enemy planes not only failed to achieve their vicious goals, but also suffered losses and returned. As for the courageous spirit of our air force rising up to fight back, it is especially admirable. Now, a gentleman has just come from Nanchang, according to the talk witnessed the real situation of the Nanchang air battle, I will record it briefly as follows,</p>
<p>On August 15th, the enemy planes first attacked Nanchang. At about 9:00 in the morning, the alarm was issued. Because all sectors usually have good air defense training, they took measures according to the planned plan without confusion. The enemy planes flew from Taiwan, a total of seven heavy bombers, first two planes, followed by five planes, our air force immediately rose up to fight back, and a certain gentleman who first flew to fight, with one person and one plane, fought with one of the enemy planes, and won a complete victory by shooting down two enemy planes, one fell to the ground and was immediately burned, one fell in a nearby village, the enemy personnel, one died and one was injured, the injured tried to escape and were captured by nearby farmers, the villagers hated them, and stabbed them in the leg three times with a knife, and then sent them to the provincial government for disposal. According to the prisoners, the enemy initially planned to use 80 of the latest heavy bombers to solve our national air force bases within a week. Such a arrogant attitude can be seen here. Asking them whether they wanted to come to China, they said that it was all the order of the officers, and they themselves were absolutely unwilling. Since then, the enemy planes have repeatedly tried to attack at night, but all failed due to the tight air defense. Only on the afternoon of the 25th, at about 12 o'clock, the alarm suddenly sounded, and the authorities immediately implemented lighting control, and the air force was also immediately prepared to dispatch. As the enemy planes flew over Nanchang, suddenly dark clouds rose and covered the clear moonlight, followed by a sudden gust of wind, making it difficult for the enemy planes to control, and the anti-aircraft guns were arranged around, waiting for the opportunity to fire, to help our air force in battle, the environment was dangerous, and they were about to flap their wings and return, but the local traitors were so insane that they fired signal flares to show the target of the bombers, and used flashlights to shine in the air to send messages, and released firecrackers specially made of sulfur and rosin. At that time, the enemy saw that there were traitors on the ground leading the way, and took the risk to turn back and throw bombs. Also, in the nearby Liantang Township area, the villagers happened to be performing a play to celebrate the gods, and the villagers did not know the enemy planes were fierce, and were beating drums to the sky and the lights were bright, and the enemy planes used it as a bombing target, and suddenly threw bombs, and the villagers fled in all directions, and four or five people were injured. Later, our air force chased after them, and the enemy planes fled. When the traitors responded to the enemy planes, the authorities secretly found out the place where the signals were sent, and arrested them according to the place after the event, and captured more than 60 traitors, including the leader Liu, a military officer of the Agricultural College, who graduated from Japan, and was very knowledgeable, but willingly became an accomplice, and found Japanese letters and code evidence on his body, but his confession was cunning, and he is still under strict interrogation. In addition, the evidence such as sulfur bombs and flags was found on all the captured people. On the evening of the 26th, at 7 o'clock, four people were beheaded in the Nanchang Stadium and their heads were hung in four places to warn the rest, and nine people were shot the next day. According to the traitors, several people were used by the enemy from August 14th, and were given a salary of 3.9 cents a day, and were arrested on the 25th, and received four yuan and several cents of enemy money, willing to exchange the title of traitor from the enemy and lost their lives, which is hateful and pitiful. Since the Shanghai war, Nanchang must get an air raid alarm once or twice a day. Since this large-scale arrest of traitors, the alarm has not happened again, so it can be seen that the traitors are raging. Also, a gentleman heard many people say that the enemy uses traitors in a certain place in Poyang Lake to set up an aircraft refueling station, please pay close attention to it.</p>

<h3>Beixinjing Vegetable Farmers Request Protection for Transporting Vegetables to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Residents in the Beixinjing area of this city usually make a living by growing vegetables and melons and fruits. Since the Japanese bandits invaded Shanghai, the area has been close to the war zone, and enemy planes have bombed the area for days. Even the remote rural areas have suffered, resulting in traffic jams. The residents in the area cannot transport vegetables to Shanghai, and their livelihoods are in a desperate situation. Therefore, the local vegetable farmers Wang Ashun, Hou Youbao, etc. jointly appealed to all sectors, requesting to restore traffic as soon as possible, and asking the military police along the way to protect them, so that they can continue to transport vegetables to Shanghai to meet the needs of the market, and at the same time conveniently transport urine and feces back to fertilize the fields.</p>
<p>After the Haimen disaster refugees were sent back, the Support Association, because the fellow villagers who took refuge were unable to return to their hometown, specially held a meeting and decided to charter 20 boats to send the fellow villagers back to their hometown to avoid displacement. An office was set up in the Tonghai Hotel at Guanqiao, Nanshi, and Yu Jingyu and Huang Linyan were responsible for the work. A total of thirteen boats have been opened successively, carrying more than 1,000 refugees. Now the first and second batches of refugees are led by Zhu Chengfa to send them back, and the owner has returned to Shanghai. In the future, it will be decided not to limit the date, and it will be opened as soon as it is full. Those who want to return to their hometown can go directly to the office to register and receive a certificate, and the office will send someone to escort them to board the ship to send them back to their hometown.</p>

<h3>A Barber Swallowed Opium and Died</h3>
<p>Su Shengzhao, a Yangzhou native who lived in No. 1, Lane 1369, Lafayette Road, French Concession, and worked as a barber, died. Nineteen years old. Because all the people in his family were killed by bombs in front of the Great World, and he himself was seriously ill with lung disease, and there was no one to rely on, he suddenly had a short-sighted idea and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium at 11 pm on the 4th. When he was found by his roommate, he was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital. Because he was deeply poisoned, the rescue was ineffective, and he died at 7:30 am yesterday. The hospital notified the French police station and sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for autopsy. A detective was sent to investigate and report to the court for inspection today.</p>
<h3>French Concession Taxpayers' Association Requests Not to Refuse Checks</h3>
<p>Letter to the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng, chairman of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, recently received requests from taxpayers, saying that since banks cannot withdraw cash as much as possible, and the water and electricity company refuses to accept checks with credit, it will inevitably affect public security. Du believes that it is indeed related to the livelihood of the concession, and specially sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, sincerely stating his words, and asking it to immediately notify the French water and electricity company to use checks commonly used by national tax collection agencies to maintain the market. The original text is recorded as follows: "Dear Sir, We have received a letter from the Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association, stating that since the outbreak of the war of resistance, in order to stabilize the financial situation, the government has formulated seven measures for banks and money shops to restrict cash withdrawals, and various taxes can be paid by check. However, recently, the water and electricity company in the concession has ignored the overall situation and requires all water and electricity fees to be paid in cash. If they do not comply, they will threaten to cut off the water and electricity. If they do not accommodate, it will affect the market and indirectly affect public security. Therefore, we ask your association to transfer the matter to the municipal government and the concession authorities for immediate correction." In response, we have found that maintaining the market is the top priority during the tense situation. Your Municipal Council will definitely sympathize. The people's payment of water and electricity bills is indeed an obligation that should be fulfilled. However, at present, it is impossible to withdraw cash. As long as checks can be used, checks will not have the same credit as banknotes. Naturally, refusing checks is also a last resort. There is no malice in this. We are still worried about whether we can notify the French water and electricity company to understand the actual situation and allow the use of checks, and everyone will be grateful.</p>
<h3>Huangpu River Sudden High Tide Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Continuous until the 10th, the Amount is Enough to Be the Champion of the Autumn Flood</p>
<p>The Huangpu River high tide suddenly broke out at about 1 am yesterday, with a volume of more than 12 feet. Before 1 pm in the afternoon, there was still a high tide, with a volume of about 11 feet. From tomorrow, there will still be continuous high tides before morning and after noon, with a volume of between 11 feet and 12 feet and 5 inches. It must be issued until the 10th. The amount is huge, enough to be the champion of the autumn flood. The 13-foot revetment outside the Bund is very close. At the same time, the high tide outside the Wusongkou is still 1 foot 7 inches and 3 points higher than the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>National Census of the Republic of China in 1941</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Ordered to Transfer to Its Subordinates to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance instructed its subordinate agencies, saying, "The Executive Yuan issued order Tong Zi No. 4825 on August 4th of this year, stating that the case of the national census has been decided by the central government to be rushed, and it should be actively carried out. However, this matter is of great importance, and sufficient preparation is required to complete it smoothly. The National Government's Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics is the competent authority according to law and has hired experts to organize the first national census statistics committee to discuss the plan, and plans to conduct a pilot census and sampling first, and then implement the national census in 1941 based on the results of the degree check and sampling to complete this huge task. As for other censuses, the National Government's Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics is also planning and preparing separately. This matter concerns important government affairs, and all levels of administrative agencies should assist in promoting it, so that the census can be completed as scheduled. In addition to the distribution order, we hereby order you to comply, and transfer it to your subordinates to comply together." This order, Minister Kong Xiangxi, Political Deputy Minister You Lin acting.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Expels Homeless Refugees</h3>
<p>The authorities of the Public Concession have recently expelled the refugees who are homeless on both sides of the road. As the shops have reopened one after another, order has gradually recovered. However, the general refugees who are homeless on both sides of the road are not only unsightly, but also the late autumn is cool. The refugees will inevitably suffer from diseases if they are attacked by the wind and dew. In order to prevent problems before they occur, patrols were dispatched along the way to expel them since the night before last.</p>
