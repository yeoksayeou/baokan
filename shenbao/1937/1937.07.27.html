<h3>最低限度？</h3>
<p>— 雍</p>
<p>自盧溝橘戰事發生以來。倐已兼旬。我軍旣極力抵抗於前。又妥愼交涉於後。所以一方表示國土國權之不容或損。一方亦尙努力於和平。以免重苦中日兩國之民衆。昔賢所謂以仁義爲干擔者。今蓋兩極其能事矣。</p>
<p>乃日軍初則食撤兵之約旣乃徵調益繁。繼之以昨晨猛攻廊房之舉，飛機如雲。漫天而至。機槍密集。擲地成雷。我軍僅以兩營之實力。守此無險可恃之孤村平野。終於爲所占領。而日軍且更提出限我三十七師全部撤至保定之條件。以冀完成侵略華北之志願。此其處心積慮。謀定後動。而不惜擲最後之孤注。以與我國一賭國運可知也。</p>
<p>夫我國固愛好和平。而不願以屈辱爲和平之代價，固委曲求全。而不能以國家爲求全之犧牲。其理由甚單純。其意志甚統一。蔣委員長前日所發表者。不特詳舉最後關頭之理論。亦且具列最低限度之立塲凡我國民。夙同斯志。乃日軍竟仍不惜破壞我最低之限度肆其要求。是其促我於放棄和平抗敵應戰之途者甚明。逮至戰禍一開。中國之遭遇。固彌感困難。而日本之前途。又豈復可問。以一二野心者之甘冒不韙。終於使兩國同受空前莫大之打擊。或更使日本政治上發生或種之橫決。言念前途。吾爲中國應戰者深致不幸。而尤爲日本言侵略者慄慄危懼也。</p>
<p>中國之爲弱國。無待諱言。然自九一八以來。已少湔其貧弱。而趨於進行建設之途。就政治言。則全國意志。業已統一。全國軍制。業已編成。就財政經濟言。則法幣政策。夙吿成功。國庫收支。勉能平衡。就建設言。則交通工具日形孟晋。糧食物品。得所調劑此在平時竭十年二十年之力。未必可得。而我國乃於短期中。一蹴以幾之試徵其成功之速。蓋莫不出於國難當前强鄰旁伺所促進。是則日本之所以壓迫我侵略我者。乃轉而鍜鍊我磨礪我。以促我於進步之途。成績具在。無待剖陳矣。</p>
<p>時至今日。其所以壓迫侵略者日亟。則以先例後。其所以鍜鍊磨礪者。亦必更强。我廿九軍之固守宛平。抗戰廊房亦正卽此鍜鍊磨礪之表現。蔣委員長所昭示於國人者。一則日臨到最後關頭。惟有堅决犧牲。再則曰放棄尺寸土地便爲千古罪。人日軍旣不吝破我最後之關頭。則我亦何惜於堅决之犧牲。廿九軍之將士旣經披鋒當鏑於前行。我整箇民族。又寗惜披髪纓冠於俄頃。卽以上海一隅言之。距離戰綫。千里而遙。然民衆之竚盼消息。與報道之傳布電訊。同其𤍠烈旣不少涉於張皇。亦不少弛其職責。人人集中其心力於國家。卽爲國家爭存之明證。後方如此前綫可知。自今日起。最低之限度。旣未易瓦全。未來之危機。自迫在眉睫。國人宜更如何發揮其夙受鍜鍊之精神。以維我民族國家於不墜乎。其亟起圖之。</p>

<p>［莫斯科］此間盛傳、又有大批蘇俄要人被捕、最可疑者厥爲遠東軍總司令加倫將軍、自調回任杜嘉契夫斯基案軍法官後、卽離此返防、但迄無到達之訉、而最近俄日黑龍江衝突、又非加氏所主持、乃戚尼錫夫將軍所指揮、加氏遠東軍同僚中、近有大批軍宜被捕、此外被捕者、尚有蘇俄統制委員會主席安蒂勃夫、前任最高經濟會議副主席羅摩夫、對外文化促進會主席亞洛斯夫、俄羅斯司法委員長克里倫哥、前任駐德大使現任俄羅斯貿易委員長金朱克等多人、第三國際機關中、亦有多人被捕云、（二十六日國民海通電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］時報頃登載社評、就蘇聯淸黨運動、有所論到、略謂、“俄國新出皇史丹林之所作爲、初非姿意妄行、共目的何在、前途若何、史丹林莫不籌之已熟、蓋純粹馬克思主義、跡近靈無世界革命之說、亦徒託空想、史丹林固深知之、彼個人雖膺服社會主義、但愛國之心初不後人、稔知此種理想、對於俄國、頗爲危險、故亟欲有以挽救之、渠所夢想之俄國政制、大約係類似家長制度之專制政治、旣非資本主義、亦與共產主義之空想逈不相向、史丹林雖有此抱負、然布爾希維克黨先進、則仍沉溺於共產主義之空想、始終不變、倘欲憑藉理智、加以勸導、爲勢所不可能、故亦惟有採取東方典型之方式、卽鐵與火是已、”但淸黨運動已使蘇聯力量爲之减弱、如波蘭邊界一帶駐軍、現無領袖加以統率、卽其一例、結論則謂、“蘇聯目前局勢演進之結果、或則陷於殘酷的專制政治、間或發生陰謀與叛亂、或則組織一種威權政制、具有社會主義之性質、但亦劃分階級、有類於法西斯主義與國社主義之方式、以上二者、自以後者較爲可信、特無論如何、自由與民主之意義、如西歐各國所之解者、必不存在、則可斷言也”云、（中央社二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>夏的專頁</h3>
<p>熱的姿態空氣中的溫度，像投機家操縱之下的交易所市塲那麼的由八十度，暴升至九十度，更由九十度上升，而有直叩一百度大關之勢。於是冷飲店中，每一個圓桌子上，都坐滿了顧客。穿得像白蝴蝶那麼的女侍，忙得臉上的脂粉，都給汁液淋掉了。人行道旁的法國梧桐上，聒噪着知了知了的蝉聲。太陽似乎是邢麽忿怒地，不肯走向地平綫下去。太太姑娘们，雖然穿的造紗旗袍，裸着二條健而美的臂，更謀着一對健而美的腿。還是不夠凉爽，所以更不得不把不穿褸兒的六寸膚圓，伸在一雙只用二根帶兒繫着的高跟鞋裹。然而不出門，倒還可以，走上街去，柏油路面，都給炙得有些兒軟了，那自然非用黃包車代步不可。可是一般的黃包車夫，正是像太太姑娘們理想中那麼的惹厭，爲的是渾身都是汗臭氣。而更可惹厭的，跑了一程子，便得就路旁，喝上幾口施茶。這些，正交織成了一個火一樣熱的塲面。</p>
<p>“冷氣開放”四個大字，在一切大舞塲，大戲院，大飯店等等的門首，應時出現了。一切大玻璃窗上，都繪上了堆絮也似的“冰字”，是多麼地誘人呀。但是，或許這是不夠公子哥兒留戀的，所以游泳池中，是擠滿着兩棲動物也似的人魚。然而海濱浴塲，或許是具有更大的誘引力，因爲海水浴，不只有益於衛生，同時，在沙灘上，靜靜地躺着，讓天然的日光，晒成着健康美的色彩，這正是好萊塢明星們，年來最盛行的玩意兒,眞可以說是摩登得不可一世。於是乎高橋市渡輪中，獨多着逭暑的男士與女士。然而反顧着市內沿河的僑栏杆上，每天正有不少不在男士與女士之列的流浪者，也用着美妙的姿態，樸向河中去，一過游泳癮，而圖着片刻兒的清凉呢。</p>
<p>熱！熱，在這都市的每一角中，都顯示出熱的姿態來。可是我希望他們對於國事，心中不要减少了熱度！</p>
<p>— （花鈴）</p>
<h3>夏天隨筆</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>“亦日炎炎似火燒，野田禾稻半枯焦，農夫心內如湯煮，公子王孫把扇搖。”</p>
<p>這一個歌兒，是水滸傳中的白勝唱的。雖然語句很是俚俗，然而僅只這二十八個字兒中，已是充分地煊染出了夏日炎炎的背景，以及農夫們煩慮的心情，和𧰼牙塔裹的公子哥兒們的閒適。</p>
<p>類似這首俚歌的事實，是時常有得發現的。</p>
<p>就是在昨天的午飯之後，我在一家茶室裹坐定。一面飲着些兒冷飲品，一面叨光着電扇的一些兒凉意。約莫是在一點半左右，忽然一陣喧鬧聲，就在門口發生着。我忙走前去一瞧，却是一個小車夫，推着一滿車的墙磚，從茶室門口經過，中暑猝倒了。磚兒是倒得滿地，車夫，由崗警雇車而送醫院。</p>
<p>當時，在該茶室中，有一位靑年，特地的走向壁間的寒暑表下，瞧了一瞧，淡淡地對同伴說道：“一僅只八十七度稍弱呢，那傢伙，怎地已經中暑了。這麼的耐不起熱，眞是笑話。”說着，他又向侍者，要了一客刨冰。</p>
<p>還有一件，也是昨天的事，是一位同居的，在門口買瓜。</p>
<p>大致因爲那個賣瓜的，討價太高了，我的同居，便大聲的對之敎訓着，说的鄕下人，都是黑心人，自己田裹種起來的東西，值甚麼錢，挑到了上海，甚麼都是狗肉當作羊肉賣了，眞不啻是在搶錢。</p>
<p>可是那個賣瓜人，却倒復鎭靜地答道：“你們上海人，懂得甚麼呀。我們莊稼人，才是苦呢。早起遲眠，雨淋日晒，挑糞爬泥，且都不要說。若是連下幾天雨，或是一連幾天不下雨，或是發生了害蟲，那眞會得人都給急瘦了一半。瞧着本錢勞力，都落空了。這種苦處，豈是吃冰結漣，開電風扇的上海人，所知道的呢。”</p>
<p>雖然，這不過是一個平凡的對白，然其意義，卻倒是相當深長的。</p>
<h3>上海暑天的二種生活</h3>
<p>— 方正</p>
<p>世界物質愈文明，都市裹的貴賤生活愈易區別，不說別的，單就上海暑期生活來說，就是個代表作了。</p>
<p>上海的富人，暑天似乎興他們無干的，因爲居的有高樓大厦，食的有汽水冷食，行的有透風的而無棚的流綫型汽車，玩的有裝着一九三七的標凖冷氣的蹺舞塲，影戲院……然而人心總沒有滿足的，當他們感到玩厭了的時候，那些牯嶺，靑島，莫干，又成了他們必到之地，反正祇要有“法幣”，誰不歡迎？</p>
<p>讀者們！不要羨慕富人的奢慾，我們回首來看看上海的貧民，（尤其勞働界）吧！暑天簡直是他們的大仇敵，因爲雖華氏寒暑表在一○○度，仍得出外工作，拉車或做工！他們是一天不做，則一天不吃的，因此發痧，中暑，霍亂總是隨着他們左右。晚上更爲難他們了，在狹窄的草棚或是低小的櫊樓裹，熱度旣高，而蚊將軍，臭司令，便大施其侵略技能，試問在這種塲合，能閉目安睡嗎？於是天爲被地爲牀了（睏馬路），雖然有時因“有礙交通”被干涉，祇好忍氣呑聲。</p>
<p>東方巴黎的大上海，誰會想到有這樣畸形的發展？也許是物質過度文明的賜予吧？然而這還不過是其中之一而已</p>
<h3>換巢鳳凰</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回（消息問城南芸窗說夢風流辭席上綺巷回車）</p>
<p>友梅笑道：這是和表兄所作的夢，有點不同的。可是他的態度，確乎是這樣，我不能在表兄面前撒謊。國器不由得嘆了一口氣道：他的態度這樣，那完全是出於不得已。假使有機會的話，他一般的是一倆有作爲的女子。友梅低頭弄着手巾，只管聽他的話，並沒有答覆。彼此坐了一會子，也很覺得無聊。這就手按了茶几，緩緩的站起身來，笑道：我應該告辭了。國器道：很遠的來了。你也不在我這裹多坐一會子去。友梅道：我多坐一會子，倒沒有什麼不可以。只是……說着，對國器看了一眼，微微的笑着。國器道:我想着，我的意思應該對你說一說。友梅紅了臉，微笑道：表兄還有話對我說嗎？國器道：用書面表白我的意思，大槪是不可能了。我想，李小姐和他見面的機會總還是有的，見了他，可以把我的話吿訴他了。友梅道：吿訴些什麼？說你的大作，不是有意作的嗎？國器道：不，你就把我作夢的這件事，吿訴他好了。友梅將手絹角咬在嘴裹，自己理着手絹的下端，點了兩點頭道：呵！表兄的意思我明白了。他交代到了這裹，也不多說什麼，回頭作了個短短的微笑，很快的走了。國器倒是忽忽若有所失，總覺着友梅今天對人說話的態度，不大自然，分明他自己好像也有點兒心事，夾雜在內。於是背了兩手在身後，來回的在屋子裹踱着步子。直等董老太在堂屋裹說：飯都快熟了，爲什麼不吃了飯走？友梅道：改日再來叨擾罷。這才知道友梅走了。心裹想着，怎麽也不向我吿辭一聲就走了這顯然也有點不願和自己談話了。自這日起，心裹更增加了一層難受，在家裹只是掩上房門看着，出門去就古今名勝狂遊一陣。有伴就隨伴同遊。沒有伴，便是一個人，也玩得很有興致。這一天，上海雜誌公司裹寄來了一筆稿費，共有五十多元。自己突然的豪興來了，自己一拍手道：人生幾十年光陰，只管向煩惱堆裹走去，那簡直是個傻子。有了錢，我要痛痛快快的快活一陣了。於是換了一身新衣服，把鈔票全揣在身上，就向朱小松家來。還不曾到他家，就在巷子口上，遇到他坐了一輛雪亮的包銅油漆包車出來。（二○一）</p>
<h3>閒話扇子</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>扇子種類很多，以形式定名稱，可摺的曰“摺扇”圓的曰“紈扇”，芭蕉葉做的曰“芭蕉扇”，蒲草編製的曰“蒲扇”。又有取鳥羽染色製成的，或呌做“少奶奶的扇子”，不是扇風的，裝裝架子，以資點綴而已。</p>
<p>以少奶奶之地位，本也毋勞親自揮扇了，現代科學昌明，電風扇可以搖頭轉動，風聲呼呼，儘可披襟當之。及其出也，大舞廳冷氣開放，夜花園淸風徐來，羽毛輕扇，正和手皮䇲一樣。可以無所用，而不可以不帶在身邊，有時展開遮掩半個臉蛋兒，言語不用嘴，而以眉目代之。少奶奶的扇子的妙用，其在是乎？從前人常利用扇子掩面，故扇子又稱了“便面”，在舊劇中還可看到這種姿態。</p>
<p>扇子的副作用尚不僅止至於此，說書先生的那柄摺扇，就千變萬化，說“王孫公子”，便可在他那柄扇子上，表演出“風流瀟洒”的神情來，而惡霸無賴，只須把扇子往鼻底一掠，或往後腦領口裹一揷。若說到“張飛唱斷灞林橋”，他的扇子，可以變作“丈八蛇矛”，說到“雙槍將陸文龍”，那麼他的扇子，又可一變而爲雙槍。八賢王的鋼鞭，黃天霸的單刀，以至於伸寃的狀紙，赤髮鬼劉唐的書信，無一不可以扇代之。所以有人說：說書先生沒有一柄摺扇在手，便無書可說，縱說，亦必呆若木鷄，毫不生動了。</p>
<p>還有一種人物，別無所長，憑三寸不爛舌，專在人與人間，施行着“挑撥離間”的本領，在張三面前說李四如何，到李四面前，又說張三如何，這種舉動名曰“扇小扇子”，無論什麼事，經他一扇，成則不足，敗必有餘。這種“小扇子”在社會上很多。當心第一！</p>
<p>話扯遠了，再說到扇子的本位。</p>
<p>人有雅俗，扇子也有雅俗，摺扇，紈扇，雅。芭蕉扇，蒲扇，俗。文人學士，名媛淑女，雅。長工苦力，婢僕婆娘，俗。雅人用雅扇，所以扇上少不了名人書畫的裝飾。俗人用俗扇，只好用零布條縫滾扇沿。小玲子略識些字，算能動動筆，但至多也祇限於“扇子扇凉風，扇夏不扇冬，有人問我借，要過八月中”這些俚句而已。是難登大雅之堂的了。</p>
<h3>高橋海濱浴塲</h3>
<p>— 羅正</p>
<p>夏天了，夏天是游泳的季節，所以這幾天裹，我們只要隨便走進那一個游泳池去，就可看到那些人魚們在水池裹活躍的情形。</p>
<p>在一個星期六的下午，我們冒着近百度的高熱，跨上了那艘到高橋去的市渡輪；接着，輪船在一陣嘈雜的人聲中，離開了雙層碼頭，向着黃浦江中駛去。風從黃浦的江面上飄過，吹散了給太陽晒得熱烘烘的水蒸氣，只有無限的凉爽留在每一個人的身邊.那尖頭蹺尾的舳舨劃子，那掛掦着大帆的木頭船，都擠在浦江上盪漾着，把這條黃浦江點綴得像一幅活潑的寫生畫，也如一首美麗的散文詩。</p>
<p>船到了高橋鎭，我們全由輪船裹掙扎了出來，爬上了公共汽車，讓它駄着我們飛也似的向前開去。車的背後揚着塵土，兩傍那油綠的原野却在我們前面展開着。經过了許多條木橋，走完了漫長的煤屑路，就看這座宮殿式的浴塲大門，已巍峨地在無數石級上面聳立着了。下了公共汽車，拾級而上，帶着一顆輕鬆的心，走進了海濱浴塲。</p>
<p>一條坦廣的石路，直伸到一個小湖邊，路傍栽着各种花卉，湖畔却砌着许多釣鱼臺，是專供遊人垂釣休息的所在。湖中也有湖心亭，硃欄碧瓦，古趣盎然，置身亭中，倚欄四眺，萬頃烟波水天浩瀚的偉大海景，以及那風帆島影，海燕白鷗，盡收眼底。往小湖繞過去，就有一列屋子，這兒，更衣室，休息室，茶點室，辦事室等，都包括在裹面。</p>
<p>在更衣室中，我們換上了游泳衣，由石階上下去，踏着柔軟的細砂，走到海濱上，在那强烈的驕陽下喘息着的海，臉已脹得有點赤金色，然而因爲風不大，所以海水顯得非常平靜，它祇輕輕地吻着海灘上五色斑斕的石子，偶或發出幾聲笑語。</p>
<p>一羣人魚衝了海水，於是那金色的海波被攪亂了，紅的，綠的，黑的，白的，各式各樣的游泳衣，電燙的，光平的頭髮，和那健美的，病態的腿知胳臂，便在海面上交織了起來。然而那些不善於游泳術的，只在海邊上慢慢地爬，眼看着許多老資格者，潛入水的最深處去</p>
<p>跳着，游泳着。</p>
<p>海面上浮着的紅色浮筒，是游泳區的界綫，筆直挺挺地豎在水中的木頭人，爲水深水淺的標誌。藍色的救生汽艇，和救生划船，不斷地在海面上巡邏着，歇力的竹排是浮盪在水面上，潮水漲落的預吿牌，也在海邊上豎着，那都是一些關於安全方面的設備。</p>
<p>那海灘上排着一長列藍白色的蓬帳，三角形的，仿彿童子軍露營時的帳幕；還有今年新添置的方形帆布蓬帳，像凉亭似的一間，很寬大，裹面足可容七八個人。蓬帳後面是一列凉房，方方正正地，一間間都是玻璃窗紗窗，房中全佈置着床，凳，椅，房外甬道上也擺着桌椅，實在是一個很好的納凉避暑之所。</p>
<p>時間在歡樂中，彷彿分外地溜得迅速，一抺斜陽已經跌入了水平綫的下面，於是，那一羣從都市裹逃出來，投入這大自然懷抱裹來的靑年男女，都依戀地穿上了衣服，離開了海濱浴塲。</p>
<p>那輛公共汽車，那隻輪船，又載着一羣海的懷戀者，仍視把他們送回了都市裹。</p>
<h3>見聞偶記</h3>
<p>— （兪三思）</p>
<p>樂得舒適</p>
<p>吳先生是個頭腦淸楚的人，他發言很有道理，昨天他對人說：“夏天受熱，實在是沒有法子，假使眞有凉爽的地方，那就樂得享受，譬如購買藥物衛生品到四馬路五洲藥房去，那裹有冷氣，有冷飮部，有沙發凳椅，而且貸價低廉，貨色齊備，種種情形，都會使身體內心感到舒適呢。”</p>
<p>沐浴經驗</p>
<p>美麗的陳姑娘，她有“上海小姐”的雅號，她在夏天差不多每日入俗，而每次沐浴必定要用“亞林沙而”和“五洲爽身粉”，因爲浴時水中放“亞林沙而”可以消毒，浴後用“五洲爽身粉”遍體舒快，所以這兩種東西就成爲她必用之品了。</p>

<p>言談</p>
<h3>“老鼠搬塲”解</h3>
<p>— 甄士林</p>
<p>都會裏的人，如果不是自己有房子，那是難免要搬塲的；上海人一年搬幾回塲，眞算不了一回事。不過據說六月和十二月都不能搬塲的，那也許因爲太熱，或太冷的原故。搬了之後，空房間租不出去，房東就要吃虧，其實，這裏面也有例外的，如虹口區域內的中國居民，那就不分冬夏了！</p>
<p>過去兩天中，爲了——大概算是謠言吧，又鬧得虹口居民鷄犬不寗起來，雖則有人在旁喝聲“鎭靜”，但也沒有多大的效力，街上仍有用小車或馬車，搬運脚盆，馬桶和箱籠什物的。這樣的大熱天，幹這樣的狠勁，眞有的像自尋煩惱了！初到上海的人，看到這情形，不免感概系之地說：“這簡直是老鼠搬塲！</p>
<p>這譬喻，當然有幾分譏刺，但却頗爲確切。老鼠是最喜歡搬塲的動物，今天東邊墻角裏做一個窠，明天西邊墻角裏掘一個洞，好像生來有這種好動的脾氣，並不感到搬的時候有什麼麻煩的。上海人住在虹口區城的，（就在其他地段，也並不見得有甚兩樣。）一年搬幾次塲，也就等於例行的公事，說不到甚麼費力了。因為搬的次數多，神經上好像也有幾分麻木，所以動手搬的時候，並不覺得有什麼反應，而且有時也不覺得爲什麼要搬，祇下意識地以爲要搬就搬如此而已。</p>
<p>這和老鼠就沒有什麼異樣了、而更像的是“胆小如鼠！”鼠的胆大概是最小的，所以躱躱縮縮，晝伏夜出。上海人晝伏夜出的本領，一向就很好，而躲躲縮縮起來，更比老鼠還要靈活好像危險的地帶是會經有人”嚴格劃界”過的，而槍子和胞彈，又都生着眼睛，决不“輕越雷池”一步，其眼光的銳利眞是與老鼠媲美了。</p>
<p>可是人為萬物之靈，究竟不應該這樣菲薄自己。搬塲是可以的，但應該絕對自由，如果愛搬，一天搬一次也行；可是，却不應該被動，如虹口區域一帶的人那樣。而且更不應該那樣麻木，希望這一次搬了之後，天下太平、隔了一兩天仍舊搬回去。</p>
<p>我以爲，至少凡是曾經搬過塲的人，都應該研究出一個所以要搬塲的原因來，接着是設法防免這樣被動搬塲的連續發生，也唯有這樣，才是我們到建眞正自山搬塲的道路。</p>
<p>但上海人是可憐的！他們常常不會想到這些問題上來，他們在重重壓迫之下，只想在那短促的餘暇中，偷偷地去給自己享樂，甚至把這種“偷偷的心情”也當作一種滿足自己的方法，斯以這社會被弄得淹淹無生氣，大家只是躲躲縮縮，圖眼前的荀安，而“老鼠搬塲”這一類的事件，便得永遠繼續下法。</p>
<p>這眞是可哀呀！</p>

<h3>‘太平天國’所昭示我們的</h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>太平天國已是歷史的陳蹟，歷史决不會重複的，但它所遺留下來的成果，却可以作我們實踐的參考。‘太平天國’的演出，可以說是站在這個積極意義上，給了我們一個很大的暗示，尤其是在目前，它指示出我們應該走那一條路，那一條路是錯誤和不應該走的。</p>
<p>在那齣戲里，表演着當年太平天國順應着當時的客觀情勢，靠着羣衆的力量，奠定了它的基礎。而中間曾一度因楊秀淸弄權，按兵不發，致使大局陷入危境。那時幾個領袖反對楊秀淸獨裁，彼此發生齟齬，大勢幾乎瓦解。而羣衆也紛紛起向責難，結果楊秀淸不得不發兵。幾個領袖為顧全大局，也捐除私仇，仍同心協力，於是，才又轉危為安了</p>
<p>這里𧥾明什麼，在大局垂危的時候，大家要合力起來救亡，絕對不應該再鬧意見，應該以大局為重。如果不顧大局，仍各自私下鬧意見，是必然召致到減亡。就像太平天國，結局便因為內鬨，而遭到減亡的結果。（這會演出的是‘太平天國’第一部！金田村）這是給我們的一個最好的教訓，我們應該把它牢記着。</p>
<p>現在我們的國家已臨到最危急的關頭，這時候大家還應該再私下鬧意見嗎？‘兄弟鬩於墙，外禦其侮’，大家應該立刻捐棄成見，集合全國的人力，財力，物力，一致聯合起來救亡！這是我們看了‘大平天國’後應有的認識的。</p>
<h3>海</h3>
<p>— 田靑</p>
<p>海是遼闊而且寗靜的。</p>
<p>海有着悠長的歷史，悠久的文叨，有着豐富的寶藏，有雄厚的力量。海的周圍，有無數的漁者，他們都惡意地覬覦着。他們用鷹一般銳利的目光，用狼一般殘暴的心眼，在海的身上，尋求每一個可以攫奪的目標，每一個可以進攻的機會。</p>
<p>海的本身是慈柔的，和善的，她有著深深的禮讓的涵養。</p>
<p>無論漁人怎麼樣地欺凌，甚至宰割，她都是容忍着，謙讓着，處處表現一個和平人的天性，處處想刻劃出一個和平人豪爽慷慨的心懷，與漁人的蠻野貪鄙的絕對不同。用精神的勝利，壓服自己心中的不平。</p>
<p>除了統治水族，淹斃無知狂妄的小生命之外，海永遠是平穩寗靜的，永遠沒有想到潮浪和波濤—除非是月魄的勾引，和風力的推動。</p>
<p>和平，忍耐！這是聖賢的遺訓。古哲的遺風，也就是海的本性。甚至這本性使她變成了懦弱，無能和卑怯。漁人的戰艦，漁船，和走私，任意在她身上輾過，任意施行殺戮和侵害：任意侵佔疆士，在她的腹地建造漁獵的營房，她只一味地忍耐和屈服，沒有反抗，讓恥辱一重重地增加。</p>
<p>有時候精神勝利的自慰，也會失掉控制一切的力量：仇恨和積憤，會衝破寗靜的人門，燃起極高極炎熾的反抗之烽火。於是海暴怒了，她想跳起來咆哮，給漁人一個有力的答覆。可是她立刻又失掉了勇氣，遲疑着，軟弱着，憤怒變成痛苦和憂鬰了，她只有向黃昏的月亮悄悄地嘆氣，向長夜的幽冥呻吟着。</p>
<p>曾經有個時候，海是狂嘯過的，她掙斷所有的鎖練，摒棄所有的怯弱和屈服；為洗雪所有的恥辱，為報復所有的仇恨，她怒吼着，捲起萬丈的波濤，淹減太陽的酷燄，淹減漁人的網羅，而獲得了極偉大的勝利，爭得震驚宇宙的光榮！</p>
<p>也許從此海便成為一個真正和平的國度，再不會有漁人的剝奪，太陽的蹂躪，這個光榮的勝利，便是真正和平的展開。可是優柔怯弱的本性，馬上在淫威下屈服了，讓自已的手抹煞了偉大的光榮，在自已的臉頰上寫下恥辱的大字。</p>
<p>於今海是危亡了，海的每一個角落都佈滿了漁人的毒計，佈滿太陽侵略的淫威。如果再不振作的話，她將會被全部侵吞了。</p>
<p>所有構成海的分子，海的全身，都在咆哮了。海會鼓起無邊的巨浪，淹減太陽的鐵蹄，淹減漁人的羅網，用血肉在海的週邊，筑起堅固的城垣，作為真正和平的保障！</p>
<h3>一天</h3>
<p>— 瑞霖</p>
<p>在污濁的河邊，人們慣常把垃圾往那曠地上堆送，隨着時日一座垃圾山漸漸地堆積起來了，又漸漸地坦平下去。於是人們便在上面蓋起草坪，又造起簡陋的瓦房！因為偷工减料，因為風雨刷洗，漸又傾向衰老。看見那片片遮着破蘆蓆子的坍塌了的墙垜，令人感染一點憂鬱。</p>
<p>虚浮的屋基埋在穢泥堆裹，瓦房和茅屋像一絛街似地連綿着。市鎮便傲然地站立在污濁的河邊。</p>
<p>淸早，街上浮着清淺的紅，清淺的綠，停在路傍的菜撻上擺着菠菜和茄子。菜葉上濺着淸水，水滴渾圓地凝着晶莹的珠子，水珠和水珠一碰便顺着葉蒂滾了下來。</p>
<p>“這個一斤——”。“一斤十－個”。“一斤九個賣嗎”？“一斤十四兩賣”。於是各自咕嚕着。菜籃愰愰地搖走了。</p>
<p>便是一個銅板，一點稱星也不肯退讓，要漲紅着𩓐子爭執，沒有羞澀，這鄙吝是習慣了的。</p>
<p>早市過去了，數一數腰包裹的一點錢：想到白淌了許多汗不高興地回家去了。</p>
<p>靜靜的日午有炎日燃着，狗吐着燒焦了似的紅舌頭喘息，舌端一絲黏涎子拖着。人像狗一樣，赤着膊，汗像細小的油滴似地在皮肉上爬，苍蠅在打盹的人的頭上盤旋，舐着鹹味的汗汁，並且撒下一點污穢。賣氷水的人眼看一塊塊的氷在陽光下融了，一塊塊的本錢也像氷一樣地融了。這年頭，沒有吃氷的人也沒有吃瓜的人，憂鬱的夏季。</p>
<p>黃昏，從污濁的河面吹起一綠悶人的風，有一畦田的人家去看看一天涸一天的河水，抬頭又是滿天星，明天單又是一個大熱天。</p>
<p>炎熱的夏天是他們的理由，於是老的，少的，和女人全可以露天睡覺，一張蓆子上便是一家人。各自打着鼾，那夏在破棉被製的小生命突然哇哇地哭起來，哭聲彷彿是小生命的喘息。</p>
<p>“唉唉，乖乖受凉了，手足都發燒”。母親，儘管摒着，孩子，却還是哭</p>
<p>“不哭。乖乖，你看屋子像火窟。”做母親的像是惱了，抓了儘是啼哭的孩子走進屋子。哭聲漸漸低弱。彷彿漸漸遠去。</p>
<p>這是憂鬱的夏季！</p>
<h3>怎樣開展我們的新聞劇？</h3>
<p>— 克予</p>
<p>中國劇作者協會，為實行演劇救國，由全體劇作者負責集體創作“保衛廬構橋”國防劇本，不久當可演出。在局勢念劇轉變的現在，新聞劇是更顯見重要了，它給人的印象真實，活躍，深刻，它容易激奮觀衆，增加抗衛力量。</p>
<p>至於開展新聞劇最方便的必取的幾個方式，那自然是活報，街頭劇和時事報告了。活報是戲劇中一種輕騎式的短小雜劇，原先由蘇聯介紹過來，它的任務是隨時以趣味的方式報告新的社會情形，政治消息，自然，在現在濃厚的抗戰空氣下，它最能切切實實的盡它極大的‘喚起民衆’的力量的。街頭劇和時事報告，一樣地不需要舞台，佈景和特殊化裝，它們都可到處流動演出。所不同的，時事報告只採用單簡的新聞，它除報告外，同時需要批判時事，普通所流行的化裝演講，卽屬於此種。</p>
<p>在推進中，我們須視當地情形，隨時更變演出方法，劇本的內容，必須隨時以嶄新的時事消息，加以補充和添改，新聞當然愈確實愈好。同時我們可分發有淺顯文字有易懂圖叢的時事小冊，或教授救亡歌詠，宣傳戰時防衛常識等</p>
<p>是時候了！希望前進的劇作者們，給我們多多編排幾個通俗的劇本，讓我們去演出，更希望大衆自己來合力創作，自動創，這配合着時事的新聞劇，才最合適，才最通俗。</p>
<p>是時候了！希望前進的劇員们，儘可能地移動你們的剧團到市鎮上，到農村去，更希望各地都響應着自動地組織起來！</p>

<p>[Beiping] According to transportation circles, the Japanese troops who arrived in Langfang from Tianjin at 5 p.m. on the 25th, claiming to be repairing telephone lines, planned to get off the train. Liu, the brigade commander of the 38th Division, Zhang Zizhong's unit, in Langfang, stopped them because he had not received orders and advised them to desist. The Japanese troops refused to accept the advice and immediately got off the train and formed into skirmish lines, occupying the Langfang military station and actively building fortifications. The two sides immediately formed a confrontational state. At 0:30 a.m. on the 26th, the Japanese troops suddenly swept our army's defense lines with machine guns from the military station. Because our side had not made preparations in advance, dozens of people were killed or injured. They reported to their superiors on the one hand, and prepared to respond on the other hand. The situation was extremely serious. At that time, Japanese troops still swept with machine guns every few minutes. The sound of gunfire was very dense for about 20 minutes. At the same time, a Japanese armored vehicle drove to the vicinity of our army's defense line and fired dozens of shots. Our army did not retaliate until 2:30 a.m. on the 26th. At that time, more than 60 Japanese troops from Tianjin took three heavy trucks, passed through Wuqing, and arrived in Langfang to reinforce. The two sides confronted each other. At 5 a.m. on the 26th, a Japanese reconnaissance plane suddenly flew from the northeast over Langfang to conduct low-altitude reconnaissance. It flew back after about 15 minutes. At 5:15 a.m., four Japanese bombers flew to the skies over Langfang and dropped more than 50 bombs on our army's barracks. Our side suffered heavy losses. At the same time, more than 300 Japanese troops guarding the station launched a fierce attack. Because the telephone lines were down, our front-line troops had to remain calm, fight back, and firmly defend their original defenses. The Japanese army did not succeed. At 5:20 a.m., another Japanese troop train, carrying 300 Japanese soldiers, three armored vehicles, and ten cannons, arrived in Langfang from Tianjin. At 5:25 a.m., a Japanese troop train carrying more than 1,400 Japanese soldiers arrived in Langfang from the new Tianjin station and got off the train to reinforce. The four Japanese bombers also flew away at 5:35 a.m. At 6:10 a.m., four Japanese bombers flew back and dropped dozens of bombs. Our army only had a small unit. A large number of Japanese reinforcements arrived, totaling more than 2,000. Furthermore, our army had already suffered heavy casualties due to the Japanese bombing and fierce attacks. Our army then withdrew from the barracks and deployed defenses in the sorghum fields north and south of the Beining Railway in Langfang. At 10:20 a.m., a combined team of 17 Japanese reconnaissance planes and bombers flew to our army's defense lines and near Langfang to drop bombs. At the same time, the Japanese army continued to attack us fiercely. Nearby people also took refuge in the sorghum fields. But as a result, our soldiers and civilians suffered nearly a thousand casualties. The situation was extremely tragic. As of about 1 p.m., our army gradually concentrated to the northwest of Langfang and gradually confronted the enemy army. It is also learned that a part of the Japanese army has attacked towards Huangcun. Due to the interruption of transportation, the details are unknown. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>

It is understood that the two sides have now stopped shooting. The Japanese army sent more than 3,000 reinforcements on the morning of the 26th and bombed with seven aircraft, so our army retreated into the Qingshazhang area, about two miles south of the railway near Langfang, to avoid its vanguard. The Japanese side has now occupied the station and its vicinity, but there have been no conflicts since 2:30 p.m. According to related authorities, the first step of the investigation personnel dispatched by both sides on the 26th, stopping the shooting, has come to an end. The second step, the aftermath, that is, how to prevent the Japanese side from expanding its military operations, is currently being negotiated. Also, the telephone lines between Langfang and here are cut off, and news is not transmitted properly. The authorities here are trying to find ways to obtain contact.

<h3>Both Sides Send Personnel to Stop the Conflict</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] The Chinese and Japanese authorities here decided to find a peaceful resolution to the Langfang incident. In the morning of the 26th, Tsukada, a staff officer of the Japanese garrison, and Maokawa, the head of the special service agency, visited Ma Yanchong, the secretary-general of the municipal government, and Li Wentian, the police chief and deputy commander of the 38th Division, to discuss everything. Both sides expressed their unwillingness to escalate the situation and decided to send personnel from both sides to Langfang to investigate the truth and stop the conflict. The Chinese side dispatched Liu Erhan, a staff officer of the 38th Division, and Lu Nansheng, the secretary of the municipal government. The Japanese side dispatched Maokawa and Kobayashi. They went to Langfang on a special train from Tianjin at 11:30 a.m. The first step was to stop the continuous shooting and restore traffic between Beiping and Tianjin, so that the situation could be calmed down. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Demanding Our Troops Withdraw to Gu'an</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Chinese and Japanese troops clashed in Langfang this morning. The Japanese army used bombers to assist in the battle.

<h3>Shantou Amidst the Tense Situation</h3>
<p>Stockpiling Grain, Increasing Planting of Miscellaneous Grains; Business and Industry Not Buying or Selling Enemy Goods; Strict Inspection of Foreigners Entering the Country</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The people of Chaozhou and Meizhou rely on imported rice for their food supply every year, reaching 3 million dan. This spring, they suffered from both floods and droughts, causing panic about food. The government specially allowed the duty-free import of 2 million dan of imported rice to relieve the food shortage. By the end of June, the duty-free import quota had been filled, and rice prices gradually increased again. Fortunately, the early rice in Chaozhou and Meizhou has already been harvested. Although imported rice is expensive, the rural areas will not be greatly affected. However, the county governments, following the orders of the Department of Civil Affairs, are stepping up efforts to urge farmers to plant miscellaneous grains to supplement the food shortage, and to store early rice to regulate surpluses and shortages. The export of sweet potato flour, wheat, etc., is not allowed, and private winemaking, which consumes food, is prohibited. Righteous granaries are established in various districts and villages, deposits in granaries are inventoried, production and consumption are regulated to prepare for an extraordinary period. According to grain merchants, Guangzhou and Shantou and other cities currently have three months' worth of food supplies. If the government can now store a large amount of rice and salt inland, open up imported rice, and encourage private storage, then the food supply should not be panicked.</p>

Public officials from various agencies must also seek two wealthy merchants to stamp and guarantee them, to prevent corruption and escape, and leakage of military and political news. Those without the guarantee of a wealthy merchant must have three colleagues jointly guarantee them, supervise each other, and bear the responsibility of reporting and correcting them. Each agency and district township office has a secret reporting box. Anyone can submit a letter to secretly report anyone with suspicious behavior.</p>
<p>The Shantou authorities previously set up a passport inspection office for foreigners entering the country in front of the Shantou Customs, but White Russians and vagrants are often not inspected and secretly go inland to carry out activities. Now, following orders from above, in this extraordinary period, it is necessary to thoroughly protect overseas Chinese. Special constitutional police have been dispatched to the Chaozhou-Shantou Railway Station, Qilu Civil Aviation Airport, and various docks, all transportation hubs, to check the passports of arriving and departing passengers and inspect the travel passports of foreigners entering the country, in order to prevent foreigners from sneaking inland to do evil and provoke trouble.

<h3>Minimum Limit?</h3>
<p>— Yong</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, more than ten days have passed. Our army has been resisting with all its might at the front and cautiously negotiating in the rear. On the one hand, we are showing that our territory and national sovereignty are inviolable, and on the other hand, we are still striving for peace to avoid the suffering of the people of China and Japan. The ancient sages said that benevolence and righteousness are the foundation; now, both sides have done their utmost.</p>
<p>However, the Japanese army initially ate their words about withdrawing troops, and then their conscription became more frequent. This was followed by the attack on Langfang yesterday morning. Airplanes filled the sky, and machine guns were densely packed, with bombs exploding upon impact. Our army, with only two battalions, defended this isolated village on the plains with no natural defenses. In the end, it was occupied by the Japanese, who then proposed the condition that our entire 37th Division withdraw to Baoding, hoping to complete their ambition to invade North China. Their intentions were carefully planned and deliberately acted upon, and they did not hesitate to stake their last chance in a gamble with our country's destiny.</p>
<p>Our country cherishes peace, but is unwilling to accept humiliation as the price of peace. We seek to preserve the whole situation, but cannot sacrifice the nation to do so. The reason is simple, and the will is unified. What Chairman Chiang Kai-shek announced the other day not only detailed the theory of the final juncture, but also listed the minimum position. All our people have long shared this aspiration. Yet, the Japanese army still does not hesitate to break our minimum limit and makes demands as they please. It is clear that they are pushing us onto the path of abandoning peace and resisting the enemy. Once the war starts, China's situation will certainly be more difficult, but what about Japan's future? A few ambitious individuals are willing to risk impropriety, ultimately causing both countries to suffer unprecedented blows, or even causing some kind of political upheaval in Japan. Thinking of the future, I deeply regret the Chinese who are forced to fight, and I am even more fearful for the Japanese invaders.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that China is a weak country. However, since the September 18th Incident, it has somewhat washed away its poverty and weakness and is moving towards construction. In terms of politics, the national will has been unified, and the national military system has been formed. In terms of finance and economy, the legal currency policy has been successful, and the national treasury's income and expenditure are barely balanced. In terms of construction, transportation is improving day by day, and food and goods are being regulated. This would not have been possible even with ten or twenty years of effort in peacetime. However, our country has achieved this in a short period of time. The speed of success is due to the promotion of the national crisis and the presence of strong neighbors. Therefore, Japan's oppression and invasion of us has turned into a tempering and sharpening of us, promoting us on the path of progress. The results are evident and need no further explanation.</p>
<p>Today, the oppression and invasion are becoming more urgent, following precedents. The tempering and sharpening will also be stronger. The 29th Army's steadfast defense of Wanping and the resistance in Langfang are precisely manifestations of this tempering and sharpening. What Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has shown to the people is that when the last moment comes, there is only resolute sacrifice, and that abandoning an inch of land will be a sin for eternity. Since the Japanese army does not hesitate to break our last juncture, then why should we begrudge resolute sacrifice? The soldiers of the 29th Army have already been fighting bravely on the front lines, so why should our entire nation begrudge dressing in mourning for a moment? Even taking Shanghai as an example, it is thousands of miles away from the front lines. However, the people's eager anticipation of news and the dissemination of reports and telegrams are equally enthusiastic. There is no panic or relaxation of duties. Everyone is focusing their efforts on the nation, which is clear proof of fighting for the nation's survival. If the rear is like this, the front lines are imaginable. From today onwards, the minimum limit is no longer easy to preserve, and the future crisis is imminent. How should the people of the country further develop their long-tempered spirit to maintain our nation and country? They should act quickly.</p>
<h3>Another Key Member of the Soviet Red Army Generals Dismissed</h3>
<p>Commander of the Caucasus Military District Transferred; Rumors of a Large Number of Important People Being Arrested</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Red Army announced two important changes today. General Kaishirin, commander of the Caucasus Military District, has been transferred to another position. The specific position to which he was transferred was not specified. His vacancy was filled by General Timoshenko, a newly appointed representative of the Red Army officers. It is reported that Timoshenko came from an agricultural background and joined the army during the Tsarist era. After the revolution, he accumulated merit and was promoted to general. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] It is widely rumored here that another large number of important Soviet Russian figures have been arrested. The most suspicious is General Galen, commander-in-chief of the Far Eastern Army. Since being transferred back to serve as a judge in the Tukhachevsky case, he left here to return to his post, but there has been no news of his arrival. Moreover, the recent conflict between Russia and Japan on the Heilongjiang River was not presided over by Galen, but by General Chinishev. A large number of Galen's colleagues in the Far Eastern Army have recently been arrested. In addition, those arrested include Anti-pob, chairman of the Soviet Russian Control Committee, Romov, former deputy chairman of the Supreme Economic Council, Yaroslav, chairman of the Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, Krylenko, Russian Minister of Justice, and Kinzhuk, former ambassador to Germany and current Russian Trade Commissioner, among others. It is also said that many people in the Comintern organization have been arrested. (National Maritime Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Times recently published an editorial on the Soviet purge movement, stating, "What the newly emerged emperor Stalin of Russia is doing is not arbitrary. Stalin knows very well what his goals are and what the future holds. Pure Marxism, which is close to the idea of a spiritual world revolution, is just empty talk. Stalin knows this deeply. Although he personally embraces socialism, his love for the country is no less than anyone else's. He knows that this kind of ideal is quite dangerous for Russia, so he wants to save it. His dream of the Russian political system is roughly a despotic political system similar to a patriarchal system, which is neither capitalism nor communism's empty fantasy. Although Stalin has this ambition, the advanced members of the Bolshevik Party are still indulging in the empty fantasy of communism and have never changed. If you want to persuade them with reason, it is impossible, so you can only adopt the typical methods of the East, that is, iron and fire." However, the purge movement has weakened the strength of the Soviet Union. For example, the troops stationed along the Polish border currently have no leader to command them. In conclusion, "The result of the current development of the situation in the Soviet Union may be either a cruel despotic politics, with occasional conspiracies and rebellions, or an organization of an authoritarian system with socialist characteristics, but also divided into classes, similar to the ways of Fascism and National Socialism. Of the two, the latter is more credible. However, in any case, the meaning of freedom and democracy, as understood by Western European countries, will definitely not exist, it can be asserted."

<h3>Negotiations Still Underway Regarding German Film Insulting China</h3>
<p>Germany Believes There is No Insulting Intention</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German Tobis Film Company's film about the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900, entitled "Alarm in Beijing," was deemed by the Chinese Embassy to be insulting to China. They requested the German Foreign Ministry to ban its screening. The company is scheduled to officially screen the film on the 5th or 6th of next month. The Chinese Embassy has recently made representations to the Foreign Ministry again. The company authorities claim that the film has been approved by the censor after several segments have been deleted. The Chinese Embassy has requested a new revision of several places, or even a ban on its screening or export, believing that if the film is screened, it will damage the friendly relations between China and Germany. Chinese students studying in Germany are particularly angry about this matter, believing that the film harms the reputation of the Chinese nation. However, Tobis Company said that the script of the film is based on historical facts and has no intention of provoking the great Chinese nation. The German Foreign Ministry will reply to the Chinese Embassy on this matter within days. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 16th)</p>

<h3>US Navy Studies Philippine Issues</h3>
<p>Contents are Kept Strictly Secret</p>
<p>[Washington] Although the US Navy is not participating in the US-Philippine Joint Committee, it is learned today that the Navy has conducted a detailed study of the Philippine independence issue and will submit detailed recommendations to the committee. The contents are currently kept strictly secret. However, according to recent publications in naval circles, the general proposal is to use the Aleutian Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, and the Panama Canal triangle as the US maritime defense.

The wording does not specify naval base, so what will be established in the Philippines in the future may be a naval station, not a naval fortress. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>

He preached in the St. Anne-Dalen Church, defended the evangelic church members who were arrested, and read out the list of arrested pastors on the spot. Then, he led the believers in prayer for the arrested pastors. Because the St. Anne-Dalen Church was small, most believers could not enter the venue to listen to the sermon.

<h3>Resolution of the French Republican Party Congress</h3>
<p>Support the People's Front</p>
<p>[Paris] The Republican Social Union Party (led by former Prime Minister Pierre-Étienne Flandin, one of the parties participating in the People's Front) held a delegate congress here for several days. Tonight, it unanimously passed a motion before announcing the adjournment of the meeting. The resolution includes the following three points: ㊀ Reiterate a faithful attitude towards the People's Front; ㊁ Demand that producers in all industries across the country unite to seek financial and economic recovery; ㊂ Define the party's goal as maintaining order, welfare, and freedom within the framework of democratic politics, while avoiding all violent actions. During the final day of the delegate congress, former Labor Minister Frossard spoke in favor of the Blum cabinet's social undertakings, but believed that the People's Front would inevitably face a crisis in the near future. The Chautemps cabinet may disintegrate, and the only solution thereafter would be to organize a cabinet based on the Belgian Paul van Zeeland cabinet. This new cabinet should start with mutual coordination among the French people to jointly alleviate national difficulties, in order to make a fresh start with the people. Former Aviation Minister Da Ar spoke in favor of expanding the political network of the People's Front, saying that the Republican Social Union Party should integrate all its creative talents and promote them. Then, Flandin delivered a speech, saying that the Republican Social Union Party should not fight against the Socialist Party, but should assist the Socialist Party and wait for the party's evolution, so that the party can merge with it. Finally, Minister without Portfolio Vivoleaud spoke and praised the achievements of the previous Blum cabinet. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 25th)</p>
<h3>Non-Intervention Committee Discusses British List of Issues</h3>
<p>Requesting Responses from All Countries Before the 28th; Accepting the Proposals Could Break the Deadlock</p>
<p>[London] The Committee for Adjusting the Non-Intervention Measures in the Spanish Civil War is scheduled to discuss the list of issues proposed by the United Kingdom at 4 PM today. It is reported that it has sent the list to relevant countries, requesting them to submit specific replies before noon on the 28th of this month, so that the subcommittee can submit them for review at 4 PM on the 29th. British government officials recently stated that this list of issues was submitted informally, and the subcommittee can still revise it when it meets this afternoon. Its content is divided into seven points:</p>
<p>㊀ All ships of various countries sailing to Spain should still be monitored by inspectors boarding the ships, and inspectors should be dispatched to monitor Spanish ports. The current maritime patrol measures in Spanish waters should be abolished, and the land border monitoring measures in Spain should be restored.</p>
<p>㊁ Volunteer soldiers from all countries should be withdrawn from Spain.</p>
<p>㊂ Recognize the belligerent status of both parties in the Spanish Civil War, but the various restrictions contained in the British compromise proposal should be adopted.</p>
<p>㊃ Authorize the British government to negotiate with both parties in the Spanish Civil War on the three issues of monitoring Spanish ports, withdrawing volunteer soldiers from various countries, and recognizing belligerent status.</p>
<p>㊄ Expand the scope of the non-intervention agreement so that merchant ships of various countries transporting goods to Spain, regardless of which country they come from, are uniformly prohibited.</p>
<p>㊅ All countries that have not participated in the Spanish Civil War non-intervention agreement are requested to participate.</p>
<p>㊆ Foreign aircraft flying to Spain should be inspected upon arrival, and some airfields within Spain should also be monitored.</p>
<p>It is said that the British government's placement of the two measures of abolishing maritime patrols and restoring land patrols at the top of the list of issues is to show concessions to Italy and Germany. The placement of the measure of withdrawing volunteer soldiers from various countries before the measure of recognizing belligerent status is to cater to the views of the French government. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 26th)</p>
<p>[London] The British side now feels that this method is the best way to resolve the current deadlock. Because the various issues are put forward simultaneously in a comprehensive list, there will be no procedural conflicts. If countries such as Italy do not have significant reservations about the proposals themselves, the matter may take a sharp turn for the better.

<h3>Drastic Increase in Cotton Planting in Northeastern China by Japan This Year</h3>
<p>Preparing Military Supplies, Expanding Planting Area</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Because Japan wants to realize its continental policy and the dream of conquering the world by force, it is actively expanding its military preparations and sparing no effort. It has been found that cotton, in addition to being used for general military supplies, can also be used to manufacture explosives. Its military uses are extremely extensive. Therefore, Japan is expanding the cotton planting area in Northeast China. According to the Manchurian Cotton Company established by Japan, the number of mu of cotton planting in the South Manchuria area this spring was investigated. Until July 20, the area was reported to be 199,547 chobu, an increase of 33% compared with the 82,410 chobu investigated by the Manchurian Cotton Association last year. Therefore, this year's cotton production can reach 34,540,000 catties, an increase of 15% to 30% compared with the expected amount last year. The statistics of the cotton planting area in various parts of South Manchuria this year and last year are listed below (unit: chobu):</p>
<h3>Reports of Arrests of Traitors in Various Places</h3>
<p>Haoxian County</p>
<p>Bengbu Telegraph Correspondence: Traitors have been lurking in the northern Anhui area for a long time, and have recently become active. The Haoxian County Government recently received a secret report from the Shangqiu Administrative Office in Henan Province, stating that traitors such as Gai Liangchen and Wang Qianchen were secretly planning to cause trouble in Haoxian. The county authorities immediately secretly ordered the various district offices under their jurisdiction to conduct strict investigations and arrests to bring them to justice. Under the orders of the first and third districts, they successively arrested the pseudo-Western Route Commander Gai Liangchen, the Central Route Commander Wang Qianchen, the pseudo-County Head Wang Litang, the Finance Committee Chairman Wang Xuemeng, and the pseudo-stablehands Wang Lide and Wang Guixian, totaling six people. They also seized ten flags and brought them to the county government together. Under interrogation, Gai, Wang, and others all confessed to being used by the enemy. Considering the seriousness of the case, the authorities successively sent Gai, Wang, and others to the Yuwan Sui Jing Public Office in Bian Yuan for legal action. The remaining criminals are under interrogation.</p>
<p>Jiashan County</p>
<p>Jiashan Correspondence: Four suspected traitors were arrested in the Hongjiatan area of ​​this county. They were carrying folding fans with maps of the Yellow River basin and a five-fen Japanese coin on their bodies. They were immediately taken into custody in the county. Lan Xiaoguan, the suspect who was arrested the other day, has been found to be free of suspicion after investigation and will be released. The county military police investigation office has been patrolling in shifts for several days, strictly inspecting hotels, docks, and post offices.</p>
<p>Changshu County</p>
<p>Changshu Correspondence: Recently, many suspicious people have been found in the urban area and along the river in this area. Some are disguised as medicine sellers or pseudo-monks. A week ago, arrests were made in Baimao, Zhitang, and Meicun. Yesterday, the urban police station arrested three suspicious monks inside and outside the city, named Dayi, Nengren, and Miaoding. They are said to have come to Changshu to solicit alms, but were hesitant to provide further details. The bureau believes that during this tense period, the sudden increase in monks from the interior is suspected of being spies collecting information for traitors. They have been sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. In addition, the suspects who were captured all had flower characters tattooed on their bodies. Therefore, low-level members of society in this county who have flower characters tattooed on their bodies are dissolving them with medicine.</p>

<h3>Random Writings from Rural Hubei</h3>
<p>— Cheng Jun</p>
<p>Suppressing Bandits and Immigrating in Huanggang</p>
<p>Huanggang has suffered from bandit harassment in recent years, especially this year. Bandits are divided into foreign bandits and local bandits. Foreign bandits are the remnants of Gao Juntin and Xu Haidong. Local bandits include Qi Guangting, Qi Pu'en, Lin Chunci, Lin Zihao, Lin Zhiyou, Lin Shishan, Mei Binggui, Chen Xinglin, Liu Haishou, Yi Lianjiu, Liu Tianran, Lu Tianran, Liu Hongshun, Wang Haier, Wang Deyuan, Wang Nanzi, Dong Zhaoyuan, Hu Defa, and other small gangs. Because they are all well-known, they are called local bandits. Gao and Xu initially had only a few hundred people, but later they seized weapons from a unit of the Northeast Army, so they had more than a thousand guns, and their numbers doubled. In addition to guns, they carried ghost-head knives, making them unstoppable in battle. Coupled with the collusion of local bandits, their momentum grew stronger. The large Jishan, Tangqi Erwan, Taoli Ershan, Xiongjiashan, Sunhe Erchong, Maoershan, Tianjingshan, Longwang Temple, Jiangjunshan, Shangxia Dang, Ma'anshan, Hejia Nao, Xiejia Nao, Zhangjiashan, Chenjia Nao, Egong Pao, Wangsheng An, Yujia Temple, Sanmiao River, Henghe, Fengshuwan, Zhazhushu Ao, Lijiawan, Wangjunzhai, Liulinwan, Shangshimen, Shenjiashan, Lijia Shan, Huangjia Shan, Linjia Zhai, Ganjia Wan, and Zhujia Chong of the Third District, and the Youma Ridge, Wuyun Mountain, Dawu Mountain, Liujia Mountain, Luojia Mountain, and Zhangjia Ao of the Fourth District have all fallen into bandit dens, stretching sixty or seventy miles and becoming completely red. Ninety-four gentry and wealthy people have been killed, dozens of hostages have been kidnapped, and countless houses have been burned. From the markets along the river in Tuanfeng, the sound of fierce battles between soldiers and bandits can often be heard. The bandits' military strategy is to take advantage of their familiarity with the terrain, launch feints to the east and attacks to the west, exhausting government troops. When the government troops are exhausted, the bandits launch a full-scale attack, and the local bandits also rise up in response. Therefore, government troops often do not gain an advantage in battles with bandits. In addition to military means, their political methods are even more severe. They provide clothing to the poor who have no clothes, food to those who have no food, medicine to those who are sick without medicine, and money to those who have no seeds for cultivation. They use all kinds of tricks to trap the poor. Conversely, local tyrants and evil gentry exploit the poor to the extreme. This engenders hatred, while the bandits use benevolence to win over the people. It is no different from beating birds in a thicket or catching fish in a deep pool. No wonder they are growing stronger day by day. Currently, Wei Lihuang, the Director of the Border Area of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, is pursuing and suppressing the bandits with heavy troops, and the bandits' momentum is gradually weakening. The main bandit dens have moved to the Daqishan area under the jurisdiction of Huanggang. Because Wei believes that the area has been deeply red, he has issued a special immigration and village merger plan, which is being implemented under the supervision of Cheng Ruhai, the Special Commissioner of the Second District. The immigration and village merger plan can be summarized into five items: ㊀ In order to prevent the relocated people from having no place to live or eat temporarily, immigration and village mergers are carried out at the same time, limited from June 15 to June 19 as the period for implementation of the immigration merger; ㊁ During the immigration merger, the village committee members of Shanqing Township should first guide and supervise the joint guarantee director and Baojia chief of the area to implement it quickly and effectively according to the regulations. If there is any intentional delay, troops or armed strongmen will be sent to order the relocation. Those who still refuse to comply will be charged with banditry. ㊂ After the immigration merger, no one is allowed to return to their original home to rest, and no livestock, grains, or miscellaneous grains are allowed to be kept for bandit use. If it is necessary to cultivate the original farmland, the Baojia chief should be reported and the nearby garrison or team should be requested to provide cover. They must still return to the original merged location at dusk. Those who are far away will be charged with banditry. As for the furniture left in the original houses, if others steal or destroy it, they will be shot immediately. ㊃ Public places in the merged area, such as ancestral halls and temples, should be used for resettlement. Households with spacious houses must also make concessions. No rent is allowed. If they still cannot accommodate them, wood will be requisitioned to build thatched sheds. The relocated households and the original households in the local villages will be temporarily incorporated into the Baojia. Each newly merged village must have a Bao chief or squad leader to take responsibility for management. For those with more than two Bao, the joint guarantee director is responsible for management. The newly merged villages must all have a joint guarantee of five or more households. The Jia chief must check the household registration daily, and the Bao chief must conduct spot checks daily. If the number of people found does not match, the head of the household and any outsiders will be sent to the district or county for punishment. ㊄ Those who have worked in the bandit area before, regardless of what work they have done, are allowed to surrender themselves and be exempted from investigation. Those who conceal and do not report will be severely punished according to the law. All households who have jointly signed the guarantee will implement joint liability.</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Holding a General Registration of Organizations</p>
<p>The County Party Department believes that many people's organizations are still loosely organized. In order to rectify the internal affairs and strengthen the power of Baoshan, it has specially organized a general registration of organizations. The registration period is from now until the end of August. Once the registration is completed, it will start to comprehensively plan and rectify everything to ensure soundness.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Serving the War Effort in All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The All-Circles War of Resistance Support Association, which was formed by people from all circles in Wuxian County, has been established and has begun its work. The Leye Society, the Youth Aspiration Group, and the Young Pioneers Group initiated the formation of a War of Resistance Support Service Group. They held their first meeting at 4 PM on the 26th, assigned liaison duties, and are working hard to carry out their work. The Puyi Society and the Suguang Dedication Group have been collecting scrap iron. In three days of work, they have collected more than ten loads. Qian Zichu and Fan Junbo, staff members of the Wuxian Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, went to Shanghai on the morning of the 26th due to a telegram from the General Association to discuss the organization of a rescue team. They are expected to return to Suzhou that evening.</p>
<p>District Chief Sentenced to Imprisonment for Smoking Opium</p>
<p>Zhou Futing, the district chief of the 13th District of Dongting Xishan, was arrested and detained by order of the county government for smoking opium. It was decided on the 26th to sentence him to one year in prison.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Ghosts Haunt the New Courthouse</p>
<p>The county courthouse was established in March of this year. The location of the courthouse is the former county government building. Unexpectedly, at about 9 PM on the 15th, when the staff members were resting and cooling off, they suddenly saw a bright electric light in the first courtroom, as if a case was being heard. When they went to check, it was dark as before. Everyone was shocked and spread the rumors of ghosts and goblins. It is said that the courtyard was originally the old residence of Qian Muzhai. All the previous officials have been worshiping Qian and Liu Rushi's gods and calling them Daxian (Great Immortal), and often burned incense and worshipped them. However, there have been ghost stories many times in the past. The supervisors did not dare to disobey the Great Immortal's will. Now that the courthouse has been established, it should not maintain this superstition due to the trend of the times, so it has been separated from the Daxian Hall. Therefore, ghosts have haunted the courthouse again. According to internal sources, similar strange things have happened many times.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Active Rice Market Situation</p>
<p>The rice market situation in Xiyi is that japonica rice sales are active and indica rice sales are mediocre. The shape is not good. Recently, indica rice has been consulted by all parties, and the goods that have arrived are very large. The Shashi white indica rice industry in Shanghai has been transferred to Yunxi. At the tea party yesterday afternoon, the market price of indica rice did not increase much. The price of japonica rice increased by more than a corner. The price of cooked white japonica rice was 10 yuan and 6 corners to 10 yuan, the price of white yuan rice was 13 yuan and 4 corners to 13 yuan, the price of Bai Bu You was 9 yuan, and the price of Shashi white indica was 8 yuan and 8 corners. The price of japonica rice was 5 yuan and 3 corners 7 points to 5 yuan and 2 corners. The market price of wheat opened at 5 PM yesterday. The price of high-quality goods was about 10 yuan per bag, which was one corner higher than a few days ago. A few dozen bags of new yellow soybeans from Lanxi, Zhejiang have been transported to Xiyi. The quality is good. The market price per stone is 8 yuan and 4 corners.</p>
<p>Revising Silk Cocoon Collection Method</p>
<p>The Wuxi Silk Factory Industry Association has built 43 silk factories this year, with approximately 17,000 silk machines, which is more than three times the total number of silk machines in the entire province of Zhejiang. The annual demand for raw materials by various factories is approximately 350,000 dans of dry cocoons. The number of cocoons taken from Zhejiang Province each year is also between 70,000 and 80,000 dans. Recently, the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Management Committee has changed the method of managing the province's cocoon trading, restricting cocoon merchant registration and prohibiting the export of dry cocoons to other provinces in order to protect the silk industry. The method is good and the intention is beautiful. Jiangsu Province should also follow suit in order to protect the silk industry in Jiangsu Province. Otherwise, the silk industry in Jiangsu Province will not be able to purchase dry cocoons from Zhejiang Province and will instead allow Shanghai merchants to compete to purchase them, and even collude with foreign merchants to traffic them for export. The existing silk factories in Jiangsu Province will inevitably suspend work due to lack of raw materials. Not only will the entire province's silk industry collapse, but the livelihood of 100,000 workers in the province will also be cut off. How can social security be imagined? The association specifically presented to the Provincial Government and the Financial and Health Bureau, requesting that the Jiangsu cocoon trading method be revised with reference to the Zhejiang Province precedent, implementing Jiangsu cocoons for Jiangsu use, and not allowing Shanghai merchants to register and purchase them.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang and Yangzhou Bank Protection Association Established</p>
<p>People from Zhenjiang and Yangzhou organized the Zhenjiang and Yangzhou River Management Bank Protection Association. The inaugural meeting was held on the 25th at the Zhenjiang and Yangzhou Automobile Company Building. Sixty-three members attended the meeting. The meeting opened at 3 PM. Han Guojun was elected chairman. After the ceremony, Wang Boling reported on the inspection of the waterlogging trend in the Liuwei area. Xu Xinwu contributed water conservancy opinions. Hong Lanyou, Dai Xingyi, Jiang Daonan, and Wang Yuanchen proposed to name the association, revised the articles of association item by item, and then elected 55 committee members. Han Guojun, Wang Maoru, Hong Lanyou, Yan Huiyu, Zhou Shaocheng, Leng Yuqiu, Lu Xiaobo, Xu Jiechen, Zhou Guren, Ling Shaozu, and Xu Songlan were elected as the eleven members of the Standing Committee. The address of the Standing Committee was temporarily set at the Automobile Company. The Standing Committee meets once a month, and can be convened at any time when necessary. The chairman is elected temporarily. The Standing Committee is divided into three groups: general affairs, design, and economy. Regarding the bank protection plan, it was decided to adopt the Nanjing Xiaguan water embankment policy, with at least two embankments: ㊀ a downstream fish sleeve on the opposite bank to control the rapid current, and ㊀ a nearby place to block its backflow. All the height, length, width, narrowness, and dimensions of the embankment will be determined after the water level drops and the situation is observed.</p>
<h3>Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Destroying Levee Foundation Arrested</p>
<p>Shen Yuan, the leader of the Yongan Sentry Team of the Jiangbao Section of the Grand Canal Engineering Office, and Pan soldiers Wang Changyao and Jiang Yufu illegally hired workers to steal snail shells from the bottom of the levee for protection on the west side of the Yongan embankment and sold them in large quantities to Li Hongji, a contractor on the Yangqing Highway for road construction. After the Jiangbei Grand Canal Engineering Bureau found out, it believed that the Pan soldiers not only did not fulfill their responsibility to protect the levee, but also carried out large-scale destructive work, which was extremely bold and evil. Therefore, it ordered the Jiangbao Section of the Grand Canal Engineering Office to arrest the criminals and send them to the county government for strict legal action. Except for Pan soldier Jiang Yufu, who is currently at large and is being strictly arrested, the other two criminals have been sent to the county for legal action.</p>

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Hongkou and Zhabei Areas Gradually Returned to Normal</h3>
<p>Okamoto Continued to Visit Feixin Dun Yesterday; Japanese Marines Were Still Busy With Troop Movements</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the cross-border road construction sections in areas such as North Sichuan Road, as well as the northern part of the city, had largely returned to normal yesterday, following the anxiety caused by the Japanese Marines' alleged investigation into the disappearance of Japanese sailor Miyazaki Sadao on the evening of the 24th. Currently, except for three Japanese soldiers stationed at the Tiantong'an-Songhu Railway crossing, all Japanese troops stationed at the old site of Tanaya Sake Brewery behind 63 Huayuan on Jiangwan Road, and at the Japanese cemetery in Bazibridge, the Japanese elementary school on North Sichuan Road, the Japanese girls' elementary school on Ouyang Road, etc., were withdrawn to the headquarters on Jiangwan Road between 12:30 pm and 2:00 pm yesterday. Patrols by foot or motorcycle were also rarely seen, and people were greatly relieved, with no more moving vehicles to be seen. As for the missing Japanese sailor Miyazaki Sadao, despite the best efforts of the Municipal Police Bureau, the Concession Police Department, the Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters, and the Japanese Consulate Police Department to investigate together, no information has yet been obtained. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether the alleged sole witness, Okazaki Yoshio, even exists, as even his name and address cannot be verified. In addition to previously visiting Yu Hongjun, the acting mayor of this city, Okamoto Kijiro, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, also visited Feixin Dun, the Director-General of the Public Concession Bureau, at 11:30 am yesterday, requesting the Concession authorities to continue to assist in the investigation. However, news leaked from the police yesterday afternoon that the sailor was rumored to have safely returned to the camp.</p>
<p>Da Gong News Agency reported that although the Hongkou area has superficially returned to its old appearance, the troop movements of the Japanese Marines have not stopped. Moreover, when reporters went to inspect, they witnessed Japanese military trucks numbered 4, 7, and 14, fully loaded with armed Japanese soldiers, heading towards Western Shanghai from North Sichuan Road along Nanjing Road. At the same time, according to nearby residents, a large number of Japanese troops were also transferred to the Landian Yarn Factory and other places in Western Shanghai at 11:00 pm the night before. Therefore, it seems that the Japanese military's preparations are now concentrated in Western Shanghai. In addition, the comings and goings of motorcycles were also occasionally discovered. As for the Japanese troops who invaded Zhabei, there were originally more than 350, but after some were withdrawn the day before, there were only more than 200 left. However, they were re-entered in the evening and concentrated behind Huayuan Street in the Japanese brewery, engaging in layout projects, etc., and it seems that there is no intention to withdraw within the day. At the same time, in the Japanese cemetery on Tongji Road, there were only more than a dozen Japanese soldiers the day before, but this had increased to more than twenty yesterday. As soon as night fell, they went out to patrol, but illegal acts such as checking pedestrians had stopped.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Warships Suddenly Left Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Katata Gunboat Sailed to the Songkou for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>According to news from the Customs, two Japanese gunboats, "Mi" and "A," which were moored in the Yongjiang River, suddenly left Shanghai at 2:55 pm yesterday. However, their destination was not reported. As of now, there are still as many as seven Japanese warships moored in the Huangpu River, distributed at the Osaka Wharf, the Jiangmian of the 16th Pier, and the Mitsui Wharf in Pudong, etc.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is reported that the Japanese Third Fleet gunboat "Katata" sailed out of port at 8:25 am yesterday morning and then re-entered port at 1:15 pm in the afternoon. It is understood that the ship went to cruise the Yangtze River estuary outside Wusongkou, and its intention was reconnaissance in nature.</p>
<h3>The Coal Mine Office Regulates Domestic Coal</h3>
<p>Strictly Prevent Traitorous Merchants from Transporting and Selling Supplies to the Enemy</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Republic of China Coal Mining Industry Joint Office yesterday, considering that in this extraordinary period, the various coal mines affiliated with this office have strictly prevented traitorous merchants from taking advantage of the situation to profit and supplying coal production to the enemy, and have attached great importance to this. On the part of themselves, the various domestic coal mines, except for a few in the North China region that have been invaded under the Japanese invaders' policy and whose output has been completely seized by them, all adhere to a consistent patriotic principle, jointly transporting and selling the produced coal to supply the special needs of the country. In the first half of this year, the demand for coal in various parts of South and Central China has increased sharply, so sales have been very good. In the future, if a coal shortage occurs in any place, they will unite with the industry to jointly transport and sell to provide assistance, so as to increase assistance in national defense. As for preventing traitors from transporting and selling supplies to the enemy, it is especially necessary for mountain vendors and merchants to monitor each other, etc.</p>
<h3>The North-China Daily News Discusses the He-Umezu Agreement</h3>
<p>The Agreement Is Purely Verbal and Has No Written Form; The Japanese Invocation Shows Serious Misunderstandings</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News published a short comment yesterday stating that Japanese spokespersons frequently cite the terms of the He-Umezu Agreement of 1935 to accuse certain actions of the North China and Central Authorities of violating the understandings contained in the agreement. The Chinese authorities have flatly denied this. Judging from the situation, either 1) the so-called agreement does not exist in writing, or 2) it is purely verbal and concerns the special circumstances of the time and the special organizations involved in the circumstances at that time. Now that these circumstances have passed, even further, it is said that the agreement has a direct relationship with the current North China dispute. Why doesn't Japan make the actual terms or intentions of the agreement public to dispel the doubts of both sides? It should be known that He Yingqin, whom the Japanese claim to have signed the agreement on the Chinese side, is now the Minister of Military and Political Affairs in Nanjing, while Umezu, who signed on the Japanese side, is now the Vice Minister of the Army in Tokyo. Even if the statements made by Japan regarding the effectiveness of the agreement are somewhat accurate, serious misunderstandings are inevitable, because these statements do not seem to conform to the policies announced by Chairman Chiang and clearly supported by He Yingqin. In any case, the publication of the agreement would greatly clarify the atmosphere.</p>
<h3>The Two-Road Anti-Enemy Association and Literary Circles Advocate Resistance and Peace</h3>
<p>At the Last Moment, There Is Only Sacrifice to the End; The Enemy Has No Sincerity, It Is Necessary to Uphold the Previous Determination</p>
<p>The Two-Road Anti-Enemy Support Association telegraphed the whole country yesterday, supporting Chairman Chiang's speech on the Lugouqiao Incident, and telegraphed Song Zheyuan, upholding the previous determination to continue resisting the enemy. At the same time, it also telegraphed condolences to Regiment Commander Ji Xingwen and the wounded soldiers at the front. The literary circles also jointly issued a notice to compatriots. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Telegrams to All Parties</p>
<p>All newspaper offices across the country forwarded to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Provincial Party Headquarters, the Special Party Headquarters of various railways, sailors, and troops, various mass organizations, and compatriots across the country: Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the enemy has greatly increased its troops and arbitrarily provoked conflicts. The people of the country are filled with grief and indignation and can no longer tolerate it. Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, is wise and decisive. On the morning of the same day, he issued a speech, revealing the central national policy. Seeking self-preservation and common existence, and cherishing peace, have been the long-held aspirations of recent years. Before peace is hopeless, we still hope for peace. If it comes to the final moment, we can only sacrifice to the end and resist to the end, but we are only responding to war and not seeking war, clarifying our country's position, clearly showing non-requirements, and resolutely refusing. The righteousness is stern, as clear as the sun and the moon. The whole country is excited and the world sympathizes. At this critical moment of survival, we should support the leader's proposition, abide by the central government's established national policy, endure hardship, unite as one, prepare for the final sacrifice, and fulfill the sacred duties of the military and civilians. This association hereby leads more than ten thousand people on the two roads to wholeheartedly support, go through fire and water, and will not hesitate. I hope that we will all advocate striving for the final survival of the nation. Printed by the Two-Road Anti-Enemy Support Association.</p>
<p>Telegram to Song Zheyuan</p>
<p>Commander Song Mingxuan of the 29th Army in Beiping, General, help: The enemy's deep-seated disasters are increasing with time. The national crisis has reached the final moment. The enemy is even more greedy and insatiable. We have retreated to a place where we cannot retreat any further. Fortunately, we have relied on our bravery to annihilate the enemy, and the enemy's arrogance has been somewhat quelled. Hearing the news, we are extremely gratified. However, the enemy's flames are still raging, and their cunning plans are numerous. It is definitely impossible to deal with them by perfunctory means. Although we have retreated first to show peace, the enemy is increasing its troops without end, which shows that they have no sincerity. Please uphold the previous determination, abide by the central government's established national policy, continue to make persistent efforts, resist to the end, and avoid falling into tricks. I cannot help but hope. Printed by the Two-Road Anti-Enemy Support Association in Jinghu, Huhu Hangyong.</p>
<p>Telegram to Ji Xingwen</p>
<p>The Headquarters of the 29th Army in Beiping forwarded to Regiment Commander Ji Xingwen and all the wounded soldiers at the front: Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, you have led the soldiers at the front to annihilate the enemy and achieve results. Disregarding your own safety and defeating the violent enemy, your bravery and loyalty are enough to inspire the national spirit and chill the enemy's gaze. In addition to admiration, we send a telegram of condolences and hope to convey it to the wounded soldiers at the front, and deeply hope for an early recovery.

<h3>North China Shipping Amidst the Sound of Artillery Fire</h3>
<p>The Tanggu Warehouses Were All Occupied; Both Passenger and Freight Transportation Plunged</p>
<p>The North China war has been happening on and off. The coastal shipping industry of various Shanghai shipping companies has been severely hit. The current situation is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Tianjin Warehouses Were All Occupied</p>
<p>Tianjin Tanggu: Recently, since the Haihe River has gradually silted up, ships with deeper drafts have only reached Tanggu. Therefore, the goods stored in the warehouses in Tanggu by various shipping companies are more than those stored in Tianjin warehouses. After the Japanese army took over the China Merchants Bureau's Tanggu wharf, this port received letters from Tianjin yesterday, saying that since the 13th of this month, the private shipping companies and specialized wharves in Tanggu have also been taken over by the Japanese army one after another. Goods in the warehouses must be moved out within one day, and goods piled up on the wharves within 20 yards will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Ships Were Seized to Transport Japanese Troops</p>
<p>The Japanese soldiers who went to North China were initially transferred from outside the customs. Since the 24th, they have begun to send army troops from the country, taking the sea route to land in Tianjin Tanggu. Japanese warships patrolled day and night between Tianjin and Yantai. According to people from various merchant ships coming to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday, they did see many Japanese warships coming and going when they passed the Yantai sea area southward. Also, reliable information was received yesterday that five Japanese ships of the Osaka Company have been requisitioned by the Japanese army to specialize in the task of transporting troops to China.</p>
<p>Freight and Passengers Have Been Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>Chinese ships have stopped sailing to Tianjin and have changed to Yantai Weihaiwei to shorten the route. As for the British merchant ships that are still sailing, such as the Taikoo Shengjing Wheel, the freight from Shanghai to Tianjin has also been greatly reduced. Also, the number of passengers to North China has decreased by eight tenths compared to before the 8th of this month. Since the North China incident occurred, the freight transportation between Fuzhou and Shanghai has also plummeted, because the Min and Ke gangs dare not handle large quantities of goods.</p>
<p>Working Day and Night</p>
<p>In order to cope with this extraordinary shipping period, various Chinese shipping companies in this city have decided to immediately increase the number of night shift workers. From the time after 5:00 pm every day, every part of both private and state-run shipping companies will assign responsible officials to be on duty all night until 8:00 am the next morning. This matter has already been implemented.</p>

<h3>Strictly Prevent the Smuggling of Military Supplies and Raw Materials</h3>
<p>A Special Municipal Federation Sent a Letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, which began by saying, "Dear Sirs, in order to prepare for the invasion, the violent Japanese have, for several months, had traitors and Japanese and Korean vagrants purchase grain and various discarded metals in various parts of our country and smuggle them out of the country for military use. If we do not quickly plan to stop this, national defense will be further threatened. This matter has been brought up for discussion at the fourth executive committee meeting of this association, and it is unanimously believed that this city is a trading port with a mixture of good and bad, and this type of situation is most likely to occur. It has been decided to ask the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to instruct the public associations of various industries to strictly prevent the smuggling of any military supplies or raw materials related to national defense, so as to strengthen national defense. Corresponding to the discussion, this letter is hereby delivered, and we would appreciate it if you would look into it and handle it."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Federation Advocates Thrift and National Salvation</h3>
<p>Practice the Minimum Standard of Living; Accumulate Income and Concentrate on Resisting Aggression</p>
<p>In view of the fact that saving the country from disaster cannot be achieved by empty words, and that the determination of victory or defeat in the war between the two countries depends entirely on the ability to fight a sustained battle, the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city decided at its fourth executive committee meeting that, in this extraordinary period, the people should universally carry out the movement of thrift and accumulate national strength to resist aggression and save the country. This has been approved and recorded. According to the person in charge of the association, the purpose of this association's initiation of the thrift movement in this extraordinary period is to awaken the 400 million compatriots to unite in hardship and practice the minimum standard of living in this critical period of national crisis. Everyone should contribute their accumulated income to the country and make practical preparations for resisting aggression and saving the country. The methods of thrift should be approached from many aspects. For example, when eating, we should only maintain the body's nutrition; when dressing, we should only seek to be fitting and practical; housing may be simple, but it should not hinder hygiene; walking should not be taken by car unless necessary. The bourgeoisie, who usually travel by car, should especially save material resources in this extraordinary period. In short, any aspect of daily life should be saved, and all efforts should be concentrated on the purpose of saving the country. This matter, this association is now planning to suggest to the New Life Movement General Association to instruct its branches in various places to promote it uniformly. At the same time, public organizations in various places also have the obligation to advocate it. As for the extravagant lifestyle and unnecessary socializing of the people, which waste national strength, the government should absolutely prohibit it. Only in this way can we achieve the final victory in resisting aggression and defending the country.</p>

<p>The English Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that, according to news from White Russians in this port, a certain Japanese merchant had contacted a certain Russian in the French Concession, entrusting him to organize a car and truck fleet in case of emergency. It is heard that the Russian is now recruiting about 300 Russian car drivers and asking various car dealerships and companies how many cars can be rented. If there is something to be used, 100 cars and 200 trucks will be gathered in Hongkou to listen to dispatch. This is a kind of precautionary nature. However, according to the opinion of Russian observers, it is difficult to recruit 300 White Russian car drivers at once, and this is something that the Chinese authorities will not tolerate.</p>
<h3>Tajiri Visited Kawagoe and Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Tajiri, the head of the intelligence department of the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, went to Tianjin a few days ago to meet with Ambassador Kawagoe and Commander Katsuki of the Garrison Army to report on the progress of the negotiations in Beijing and ask for instructions.

<h3>The Songbao Long-Distance Bus Resumed Service Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County Government Returned the Seized Car</p>
<p>The long-distance bus operating between Wusong and Maishan is a branch line of the Shanghai-Tai Long-Distance Bus Company. The suspension of the entire line was caused by the Baoshan County Government detaining a bus the day before, and the Songshi exchange was cut off, and people felt quite uneasy. When the Shanghai-Shanghai Garrison Headquarters heard the news, they immediately notified the Baoshan County Government by telephone to stop the car detention, because the suspension of the bus service was related to traffic and local security. The county government authorities feared that the situation would escalate, so they returned the detained car, so yesterday it operated as usual.</p>

Now, with the situation becoming increasingly serious, relief work is urgently needed. In addition to joining the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association's Relief Committee to actively handle relief work, it has been decided to hold the first general meeting of members at the association's office at 4:00 pm on the 28th of this month. Yesterday, medical and pharmaceutical groups in this city, medical education institutions, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Red Cross Society, and other groups related to relief work were notified to send representatives to participate. At that time, they will discuss 1) the recruitment and training of relief workers, 2) the study of relief transportation locations, 3) the practical work of relief, and other issues, and elect committee members and appoint general managers and special committee members.</p>
<p>Charity Group Disaster Relief Association</p>
<p>The Charity Group Joint Disaster Relief Association of this city has expanded for the North China Incident, and the people have suffered great losses. In addition to jointly training relief personnel with the Chinese Red Swastika Society, the World Red Swastika Society, the Chinese Buddhist Association, and other groups to prepare for war relief work, it has also established refugee shelters in Lugouqiao and Wanping in Beiping to avoid displacement. Yesterday, it issued a solicitation to all sectors to raise funds for relief. The land in North China is barren, and in recent years, it has been invaded, trampled, and oppressed by strong enemies, making it even more haggard. Recently, another incident occurred, with bloodshed at Lugouqiao and Wanping becoming ruins. This association has sent Standing Committee member Yang Zigong to personally investigate. According to the report, shops, houses, and fields have all been turned into scorched earth, and deaths are everywhere. It is unbearable to see the displaced people, and funds should be allocated quickly to relieve the families of the dead, and methods should be devised to accommodate women and children. This association is responsible for relief and has an unshirkable duty. In addition to immediately remitting the remaining funds for appeasement and relief, the country is based on the people, and we hope that all sectors of the benevolent will have the heart to save people and generously donate money and materials to save these survivors. We cannot help but look forward to it. We also send letters to all sectors to solicit donations for relief. Respectfully, North China has been re-subjected to shackles for more than a day. Trampling and oppression have made people unable to live. Recently, heavy troops have pressed the border, and artillery fire has filled the sky. Bloodshed at Lugouqiao and Wanping have become ruins. Soldiers have stepped forward to fight the enemy, and disaster victims are waiting for death. The war is tragic. Our government has decided to respond to the war, and the people are willing to sacrifice for the country. When will the incident occur, and where should relief be given? Looking to the future, we do not know where to stop. We will bravely defend the country with passion, and we have an unshirkable duty to contribute righteously. We can only do our best and persevere to the end, waiting for the enemy to regret their mistakes. Currently, houses in the Wanping area have been destroyed and deaths and injuries are everywhere. This association has sent personnel to personally provide relief. In addition to first allocating funds designated for the relief of disaster-stricken areas by donors and remitting them to the front for relief, saving the country requires saving the people. We hope that compatriots at home and abroad will have the heart to save people and plan for the country, and generously donate money and materials for continuous relief. The ambitions of strong neighbors will not be restrained for a day, and our responsibility will not end for a day. Sincerely, we respectfully await your reply.</p>

<h3>Silk Factory Trade Association Appeals for Cancellation of Ban on Cocoon Exportation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Telegram to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Industry Urging Action and Petitioning Government and Party Organizations for Relief; Emergency Meeting Held by Two District Trade Unions Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang prohibited the export of dried cocoons and promulgated regulations for the management of cocoon collection, silk factories in Shanghai have been forced to suspend operations. The Silk Factory Trade Association yesterday telegraphed the Executive Yuan and other bodies, urging action and petitioning government and party organizations for relief. The Nos. 4 and 6 District Silk Filature Trade Unions originally planned to convene a general meeting of worker representatives this morning to collectively discuss petitioning measures. However, due to the urgent situation, it was decided at yesterday's emergency meeting to postpone the meeting. Details are summarized below:</p>
<p>Telegram Requesting the Executive Yuan and Ministry to Rescind the Ban</p>
<p>The association yesterday telegraphed President Chiang of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, stating: "The production of southern raw silk is a major part of international trade. Shanghai factories were the earliest to promote it, having done so for over 8,000 years. This extended to Wuxi in Jiangsu, creating a thriving industry. Farmers in Shanghai suburbs do not raise silkworms. The cocoons from Jiangsu province are absorbed by silk factories in Wuxi, so Shanghai silk factories must source their raw materials from Zhejiang. As a result, we encouraged Zhejiang farmers to develop sericulture and purchased cocoons at high prices to incentivize them. In recent years, the number of silk factories in Zhejiang has steadily increased, and this prosperity is due to the sacrifices made by Shanghai factories. This spring and summer, there has been a cocoon shortage, and we rely on Zhejiang cocoons to supplement our supply to maintain production. However, the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee recently established cocoon collection regulations that restrict Shanghai merchants. (Omission). For the cocoons they store, they are prohibited from exporting them, so Shanghai merchants have no right to collect cocoons, even for the types of cocoons they grow. Dried cocoons purchased and stored cannot be transported out. With the raw material supply exhausted, they will be forced to suspend operations. There could be no greater injustice. We have received repeated reports from our members. Despite sending letters and telegrams urging action, we have received no concrete response. We implore your Excellencies to consider the importance of Shanghai silk factories to the local economy and security, and to immediately telegraph the Zhejiang Provincial Government to instruct the Sericulture Control Committee to rescind the ban on cocoon exports, restore the previous free flow of commercial goods, and comply with the principle of freedom of business for the people. We await your orders with the utmost urgency." The Shanghai Silk Factory Trade Association Committee respectfully states. The association also sent representatives Yang Yeqin, Qiu Shencheng, Zhang Qiling, Chen Zezhong, Zhang Peishen, Zhang Yunsheng, Shen Huachen, and Xu Peixiong, among others, to the Municipal Party Headquarters yesterday morning to petition for the transfer of their request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, urging the Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to promptly order the Construction Department and the Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement Committee to repeal the ban on cocoon exports. Standing Committee member Jiang Huaishu received them and agreed to forward the letter to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang for review. In the afternoon, they went to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau to continue their petition, where representatives were dispatched to receive them separately and agreed to forward the matter to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang for review.</p>
<p>Emergency Meeting of Two District Trade Unions</p>
<p>The Nos. 4 and 6 District Silk Filature Trade Unions convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors at 2:00 PM yesterday. Those present included Chen Xiupu, Yang Hongmei, Wu Cuichu, and others from District 4, and Yuan Yunlong, Yang Gengdi, Liu Sanbao, and a dozen others from District 6. Chen Xiupu chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) The resolution to postpone the previously planned general meeting of representatives due to the tense situation was passed. (2) The proposal to hold a joint meeting of directors and group leaders at each factory was passed. (3) The resolution on how to handle factories forced to close and unemployed workers was: To conduct unemployment registration in both districts and then consider relief measures. (4) The resolution on whether to use the declaration drafted by comrades Chen and Yuan was: To be published after the directors' group meeting is held. (5) The resolution to notify workers at each factory to work with peace of mind and not to lose work efficiency due to the cocoon ban was passed. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the association yesterday that the two trade unions, in view of the fact that the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have banned the export of dried cocoons, causing Shanghai silk factories to be forced to suspend operations and tens of thousands of silk workers to face unemployment, consider the matter of great importance. It is reported that the first step is for all directors and supervisors of the two trade unions to petition the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and the General Labor Union, and to issue a declaration at the same time. The second step is to send representatives to Nanjing to petition the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan.</p>

<h3>Measures for Inspection of Weights and Measures in Cooperation with Customs</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Informs Municipal Government to Follow; Unqualified Items Should Be Reported and Shipped Back for Export</p>
<p>The Municipal Government yesterday approved the Ministry of Industry's dispatch on three measures for weights and measures inspectors to inspect imported weights and measures in cooperation with customs: (1) When a merchant purchases weights and measures from overseas and imports them, they should first submit the relevant invoices, contracts, and other documents to the Weights and Measures Inspection Institute for verification and issuance of a temporary permit for import. When a merchant declares customs, in addition to the customs declaration that should be submitted according to regulations, they should submit an additional copy of the declaration along with the temporary permit for import for review. If there is no such permit, customs will not allow the declaration. After customs verify that the declared weights and measures are correct, pay the taxes, and the merchant is allowed to extract the goods, and customs will send a copy of the declaration with the visa to the Inspection Institute for verification. (2) After the merchant extracts the transported weights and measures, they should immediately submit them to the Inspection Institute for inspection. To avoid merchants not applying to the Inspection Institute for inspection, the Inspection Institute may, before issuing the temporary permit for import, instruct the merchant to pay a deposit, provide a guarantee, or use other methods to guarantee. (3) If the weights and measures transported by the merchant are determined to be qualified by the Inspection Institute, the Inspection Institute should return the deposit paid by the merchant or cancel the guarantee. If the inspection deems all or part of the items unqualified, the Inspection Institute should, on the one hand, instruct the merchant to report the unqualified items to customs and ship them back for export, and on the other hand, indicate the unqualified items on the original customs declaration sent by customs and send it to customs. Customs will verify the items, allow them to be re-exported, return the original taxes, and sign the declaration to prove that the items have been re-exported. The declaration will then be returned to the Inspection Institute for review, and the Inspection Institute will return the deposit paid by the merchant or cancel the guarantee. The Municipal Government has transferred the instructions to the Social Affairs Bureau, instructing them to comply.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Sets Deadline for Income Tax Returns</h3>
<p>Must Be Submitted to the Association by the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance Income Tax Department sent a letter to the Shanghai Lawyers Association stating: "Dear Sirs, According to Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, self-employed individuals should declare and pay income tax on their salaries and should first report their name, address of business income, and other items to this office for registration.

Please forward them to your members to fill out and submit to your association for collection and forwarding to this office. We also request that you first send a copy of the names of all your members to this office for verification." After receiving the letter, the association submitted it to a joint meeting of the Board of Supervisors and resolved to notify all members to submit the forms to the association by July 31 for compilation and reporting.</p>
<h3>Summer Hygiene Campaign to Close Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Closing Ceremony at the People's Education Hall; Hygiene Exhibition Closes Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Summer Hygiene Campaign organized by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau has brought many reforms to the public health of the city. The number of citizens vaccinated this year has increased by 20% compared to last year, proving that there is a gradual understanding of health issues. The hygiene police have also been dispatched diligently. It is learned that the campaign is scheduled to hold a closing ceremony at the People's Education Hall at 10:00 AM tomorrow, which will be presided over by Li Ting'an, Director of the Health Bureau. The hygiene exhibition at the People's Education Hall will also close at the same time.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Revocation of Zhang Huanwen's License by the China Merchants Bureau</h3>
<p>It was reported that crew member Zhang Huanwen, etc. of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company were ordered by the Ministry of Communications to be dismissed and permanently barred from employment, and that their licenses should be revoked. Inquiries with the responsible person of the bureau revealed the following facts regarding the case: Several months ago, a person named Zhang Lanying submitted a complaint to the Ministry of Communications, accusing Zhang and others of various acts of corruption. The ministry ordered the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to investigate. After receiving the order, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company dispatched personnel to conduct a secret investigation. It was found that the accused had previously organized a credit cooperative to handle illegal loans, which was a fact, and that Zhang had never held a fixed position on board the ship since being transferred to fill the position of first mate in the retention department. The rest of the allegations were found to be unsubstantiated. The address of Zhang Lanying was also checked, but no such person was found. This was reported back to the ministry. In April of this year, the ministry ordered Zhang and others to be dismissed and permanently barred from employment on the grounds that they had made high-interest loans, exploited crew members, and forged assets to obtain certificates, and that their licenses should be revoked. Zhang and others then submitted a petition to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to defend themselves, which the bureau forwarded on their behalf. Recently, the ministry issued an order stating that Zhang Huanwen had forged his qualifications and fraudulently obtained his certificate, which was a slightly different circumstance. Therefore, it has been approved to exempt him from having his license revoked, but there is no express statement that he has been allowed to resume his duties. As for a certain crew member who received the same punishment in the same case, the original punishment remains in effect. It is rumored that the bureau reported the matter falsely, resulting in the revocation of the punishment, but this is not true.</p>
<h3>Railway Transportation and Other Meetings to Be Attended by Representatives from Both Railways</h3>
<p>Xiao Weiguo to Assume Various Positions</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways' Tenth National Railway Transportation Conference has been decided to convene in Nanjing starting on August 25, and will continue to hold the 18th National Intermodal Transportation Conference and the 10th National Intermodal Transportation Accounting Conference. Each railway has sent personnel to attend the meetings. It is learned that the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has assigned the following personnel to attend: (1) Xiao Weiguo, Chief of the Traffic Department, to attend the National Railway Transportation Conference, with Wang Fugong of the Traffic Department's Operations Section, Wang Peiqing, Director of the Dispatch Section, and Zhang Zhixian of the Freight Section attending as nonvoting participants; (2) Xiao Weiguo to attend the National Intermodal Transportation Conference as a representative, with Wang Fugong, Wang Peiqing, Zhang Zhixian, Zheng Qingliu, Mo Jiefu, Li Wanchu, and Zhou Minggeng attending as nonvoting participants; (3) Mo Jiefu, representative of both railways, to attend the National Intermodal Transportation Accounting Conference, with Li Wanchu and Zhou Minggeng attending as nonvoting participants.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers Association Urges Improvement of Heavy Smoke from Public Buses</h3>
<p>For the Sake of Summer Public Hygiene, Please Expedite Improvement by the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai International Settlement sent a letter to the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir, We have received a letter from the First District Branch of the Shanghai Special District Citizens' Federation, as well as the 12th, 26th, 7th, 38th, 43rd, 41st, 17th, 15th, 36th, 28th, 29th, 31st, 39th, 40th, 42nd, 27th, 18th, and 32nd, 45th District branches, jointly stamped and opened (omission). Upon investigation, it is common knowledge that the heavy smoke emitted by public buses when they are in operation is a nuisance and the polluted air is harmful to public health. There have been many criticisms in Chinese and foreign newspapers, and citizens have repeatedly requested the Municipal Council to take action. In 1934, the Municipal Council notified the company to make improvements. In 1935, the Police Committee officially set a deadline for improvements, or else it would take action. The company then claimed that some of the ordered parts had not yet arrived and requested an extension. It was resolved to hand it over to the Public Works Department for investigation and report to make a decision. At that time, it was winter, and the Public Works Department granted a grace period, as winter is the time when bus smoke is the heaviest, waiting for the company to complete the improvements in the spring of the following year. Now, another year and a half have passed, and not only have there been no improvements, but the smoke from the cars is even thicker in the summer. For the sake of public health and its own responsibility, the Municipal Council should immediately strictly limit the company to complete the improvements quickly, or else punish them to show fairness. As this matter concerns public health, we urge your council to expedite negotiations to achieve the goal of improvement."</p>

<h3>French Concession Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to the Municipal Council to Abolish Cattle and Sheep Transit Tax</h3>
<p>Slaughter Merchants and Slaughterhouse Do Not Cooperate, Which Hinders Tax Administration and Market Prosperity</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Food Affairs Office, in response to the French Municipal Council's implementation of the cattle and sheep transit tax, the industry unanimously opposed it and sent a letter to the French Concession Taxpayers Association to negotiate with the French authorities and temporarily abolish it to help businesses in distress. The original letter from the Taxpayers Association to the Municipal Council is recorded below: "Dear Sir, We have received a letter from the Shanghai West Food Affairs Office, stating that since the French Concession Municipal Council implemented the cattle and sheep transit tax, slaughterers and shopkeepers have considered that the authorities disregarded the difficulties of businesses and suddenly increased this extra tax, which the industry cannot afford. After several negotiations, they requested the withdrawal of the order, but to no avail. Therefore, the slaughterers, after the cattle and sheep industry association decided, unanimously refused to slaughter at the French Concession slaughterhouse starting from July 1 to show their opposition. After ten days of stalemate, there is still no solution. Although the French Municipal Council has agreed to reduce the collection by half starting from January 1, 1938, it has also been discussed by our association, which unanimously believes that it must not be achieved until it is completely abolished. If the stalemate continues, it will form a deadlock and avoid the occurrence of incidents, which is deeply worrying. Such taxes are called transit taxes, and the name implies that they are not only illegal but also involve the relationship of national sovereignty. We believe that your council is the leading business group in the district and will be able to assist. Therefore, in this emergency, we urge you to send a letter to the French Municipal Council to immediately abolish the previous proposal to reassure businesses. This is for the public convenience. According to this, the cattle and sheep transit tax was once discussed by our association and requested your council to postpone the event. Because there were original taxes on cattle and sheep slaughter, and then added the transit tax, it is like stacking beds, and the opposition of cattle and sheep merchants is naturally expected. Now, as a result, a non-cooperative resistance movement has occurred, and all cattle and sheep slaughter has disappeared from the slaughterhouse in the French Concession, which not only affects your council's slaughter tax administration, but also affects the prosperity of the market, which is particularly important. We hereby transfer the letter and hope that you will check it and approve the temporary abolition of the cattle and sheep transit tax to help businesses in distress. This would be a great blessing." To the French Concession Municipal Council,</p>

<h3>Guo Zhuqiao Accused by Younger Brother of Embezzling Five Million</h3>
<p>Because the Crime Requires Prosecution, the Judge Advised Both Parties to Settle Out of Court</p>
<p>Guo Zhuqiao, a Chaozhou native residing on Avenue Joffre and currently chairman of a certain bank, started his business by selling opium and accumulated over five million yuan. He and his brothers, Guo Weiyi and four others, have already divided their assets. However, his half-brother, Guo Taixiang, did not receive a share, and a dispute arose starting in 1935. Du Yuesheng, a prominent figure, mediated, and Guo Zhuqiao only agreed to deposit 200,000 yuan in a bank as shared property for distribution. Guo Taixiang refused, believing that Zhuqiao had concealed and embezzled assets, so he hired lawyer Li Mo to represent him and filed a private prosecution in the Criminal Division of the Special No. 2 Court, accusing Guo Zhuqiao of embezzling over five million yuan in assets. Judge Liao Yan has opened court for questioning several times, but the defendant has not appeared, only lawyer Qin Liankui has appeared in court to defend him. The court has adjourned and ordered both parties to settle out of court. As reported in this newspaper, yesterday morning, the court was opened again for questioning. The defendant, Guo Zhuqiao, was still represented by lawyer Qin, who said that the defendant was recuperating in Jiangsu and could not appear in court, and requested a postponement of three weeks so that both parties could settle out of court. The judge said, "This case is a crime that requires prosecution. This court hopes that both parties can settle out of court. If a settlement cannot be reached, the court will proceed with the trial according to law next time. Regarding the issue of jurisdiction, because the defendant probably did not have a signboard when he opened the real estate agency before, the court will of course accept this case based on the defendant's current residence on Avenue Joffre, which is within the court's jurisdiction, and there is no problem." At this point, both parties agreed to postpone the case to settle out of court. The court then approved the postponement and adjourned the hearing until 8:00 AM on August 16.</p>
<h3>Chinese Detectives Initiate Arrests for Extortion of Yan Yuanxi</h3>
<p>Detectives Arrest Two Bandits; Recount the Course of the Investigation</p>
<p>Yan Yuanxi, a native of Jiangdu and owner of the Shanghai Underwear Factory at No. 30 Kangjia Bridge, Bubbling Well Road, had received five threatening letters from the gang named Sanhe and Zhuanmen Tuan, demanding 5,000 yuan, from February 20 of this year to the day before yesterday. Yan reported this to the Jing'an Temple Police Station. Yesterday, Chinese Detective Bird Chengmo and detectives Ni Jiafeng and Ma Shifan arrested the perpetrators Cui Yunyuan and Ma Xingsheng, both from Shandong. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the No. 8 Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted them under Article 346 of the Criminal Law for attempted extortion and recounted the course of events. He said that Yan Yuanxi first received two threatening letters from the gang named Sanhe in February of this year, demanding 5,000 yuan and arranging to meet near the Wing On Company and the Great World. Yan ignored the letters and did not report them to the police station. Later, Yan went to Tianjin and did not return to Shanghai until March 4, after which there were no incidents. Unexpectedly, Yan recently received two more threatening letters from Zhuanmen Tuan, still demanding 5,000 yuan and arranging to meet in the wasteland of Xiaoshadu Road, with the person coming to have two cigarette cans and a newspaper as a secret sign. Yan then reported the information to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, which sent detectives disguised as Yan's representatives to wait. As a result, although the two defendants were seen loitering nearby twice, they did not converse, so it was not convenient to arrest them rashly. Unexpectedly, on the 23rd of this month, a fifth letter was received, arranging to meet at 7:00 or 8:00 PM on the 24th in the wasteland next to the Hongshou Lane Grand Bell on Xiaoshadu Road, with the person coming still having a cigarette can and a newspaper. The detectives went on time and saw the two defendants already there, whispering to each other. They did not want to approach to communicate and finished writing the letter, then went into Hongshou Lane. Suddenly, they rushed forward and took Cui and Ma into the police station. Under questioning, they confessed that the matter was initiated by Wang Yukun, a Chinese detective at No. 1599 in Shaanxi. Because Wang knew Yan's family situation well, all the letters were written by Wang. The two of them were only responsible for communicating. Wang is now at large and requests a postponement. According to Yan Yuanxi's statement of receiving the letter, when the defendants were questioned, they admitted that they were instructed by Wang Yukun to negotiate. Judge Huang verified the confessions and ordered the defendants to be detained pending further questioning in seven days.</p>
<h3>Three Children Die Tragically</h3>
<p>Two Drowned, One by Hanging</p>
<p>Zhao Jinlin</p>
<p>Zhao Jinlin, a sixteen-year-old boy from Wuxi, was an apprentice at Lu Rui Ji awning shop at 437 Broadway Road. At 2 p.m. the day before yesterday, he and several companions went to swim in the river near Diswei Road on Duck Death Road for fun. Unexpectedly, Zhao did not know how to swim and it was low tide, resulting in him tragically drowning. His companions reported this to the police, who arranged a search. At 5:15 p.m. that day, Zhao's body was found nearby. He was rescued and sent to the hospital, but medical treatment proved ineffective, and he died.</p>
<p>Yuan Jifu</p>
<p>Yuan Jifu, a thirteen-year-old boy from Ningbo, lived at 155 and a half Hejian Road, Ningwu Road. At around 2 p.m. on the 24th of this month, he and several other children went swimming in the river there. Unfortunately, he did not know how to swim and tragically drowned. People managed to recover him and transported him to Sacred Heart Hospital, but medical treatment proved ineffective, and he died.</p>
<p>Shao Jinlin</p>
<p>Another boy, Shao Jinlin, a fifteen-year-old from Chongming, was an apprentice at Changyu Foundry at 80 Andingli, Zhoujiazui Road. At 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, the boy suddenly became dissatisfied with his work and conceived a world-weary thought. He went alone to an abandoned area east of Baoding Road, and hanged himself with his belt on a pile of wooden boards. A Chinese constable numbered 1815 happened to see him passing by and tried to cut him down. He was transported to Sacred Heart Hospital, but medical treatment proved ineffective, and he died. The above three corpses were all investigated by detectives from various police stations and taken to the Philanthropic Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court was requested to dispatch Prosecutor Zhang Zongru accompanied by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang to the morgue. They confirmed the identities of the corpses, and the families were notified to separately sign undertakings to claim the bodies for burial.</p>

<h3>Workers in Western Shanghai Raise Funds to Comfort Soldiers Fighting the Enemy</h3>
<p>Several Hundred Yuan Raised by Yesterday Evening</p>
<p>The labor unions in the western districts of Shanghai, considering that our army in North China is fighting the enemy with blood and that various groups in Shanghai have already raised consolation money to comfort the troops at the front, and that although workers toil and labor, they are all citizens and should not lag behind in patriotism, specifically launched a joint initiative by the labor unions to raise worker consolation money in various factories, hoping to accumulate a large sum. It began yesterday, with various labor unions raising funds separately. Workers, deeply understanding the meaning of patriotism, are economizing on food and clothing and contributing enthusiastically. Several hundred yuan were raised in one day, and there are still those who have not yet handed over their contributions. It is also heard that this movement will be extended to factories throughout the city, in the hope that workers can also contribute to the anti-Japanese movement.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zhaozhou, Key Criminal in Sun Shaoqing Case, Arrested</h3>
<p>Jiang Had Changed His Name and Was Doing Business in Nanjing; He Was Captured After a Chase of Five or Six Li</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing, a former constable from Tongzhou who had been dismissed, previously partnered with Jiang Zhaozhou (also known as Jiang Shu), a lawyer from Anhui, to form the Shuguang Law Firm, specializing in undertaking and abusing litigation. They used intimidation or destroyed the reputations of others to achieve their ultimate goal of defrauding money. Over the years, the amount of money obtained illegally totaled approximately hundreds of thousands of yuan. Not long ago, the First Special District Court suddenly received a written complaint from Jiang Zhaozhou, accusing Sun Shaoqing of pocketing the money alone. As a result, the inside story of their illegal activities was revealed. At that time, the court immediately dispatched the police inspectorate to investigate. Upon investigation by Inspector Lu Liankui and Detective Liu Shaokui, it was determined that Sun and Jiang should both bear criminal responsibility. When the detectives went to arrest Jiang at 4 Hongxili, Aivenyi Road, Jiang had already fled upon hearing the news. Only Sun Shaoqing and his wife, Sun Zhu, were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. Sun was sentenced to five years in prison and fined one thousand yuan, and Sun Zhu was sentenced to one year in prison. Appeals were also rejected by the High Second Branch Court. Jiang remained at large. Recently, detectives Lu and Liu learned that Jiang had now changed his name to Zhang Xineng and was hiding at 105 Dashiba Street, Nanjing, where he was serving as the director of the preparatory office of the China National Products Company on Zhongzheng Street. They immediately ordered detective Zhang Yunhong and Yang Xiyuan to take an official letter to Nanjing, requesting assistance from the local authorities. At 3:30 p.m. on the 24th of the month, detectives Zhang and Yang were waiting in a teahouse opposite Jiang's house when they suddenly saw Jiang go out. Just as they were about to arrest him, Jiang jumped onto a passing public bus and sped away. The detectives immediately hired a taxi and chased after him. After chasing for about five or six li to Taiping Road, they finally caught up and arrested Jiang on the bus. He was brought back to Shanghai for detention the day before yesterday and escorted to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Feng Shide opened the court and questioned him. The police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that the defendant's case was the same as Sun Shaoqing's, so Sun's entire file should be retrieved to clarify the case. He requested that the case be adjourned for further hearing. Jiang Zhaozhou denied having filed a complaint against Sun Shaoqing and requested bail. Judge Feng verified the confession and ordered Jiang to be remanded in custody for another week for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Female Sculptor Chen Zhixiu Returns from France</h3>
<p>Ms. Chen Zhixiu, a sculptor who studied in France, was selected by the Zhejiang Department of Education to go to France in the eighteenth year of the Republic. She first graduated from the National Lyon School of Fine Arts in France, and then entered the sculpture department of the Paris National Higher School of Fine Arts, becoming the first Eastern woman to be officially admitted to the school. She studied with renowned sculptors Xueka and Taiga Dou, and was praised by her teachers and friends. Her works have been exhibited in Lyon and Paris salons, and have received much praise. Two years ago, her 'Bronze Statue of a Girl' was praised by Yisimen, Director of the Department of Fine Arts of the French Ministry of Education. This year, at the invitation of Guo Taiqi, the Chinese ambassador to the United Kingdom, she created a bronze statue for Premier Sun Yat-sen. The statue was seen by Kong Wu when he went to England, and he greatly praised it, and specially allocated huge funds as a reward, and designated the statue to be permanently preserved in the Premier's Memorial Room at the Chinese Embassy in London. It is now reported that Ms. Chen, having been hired by the National Beiping Art College, set off on the Qinlabao last month and arrived safely in Shanghai yesterday. Friends and relatives who heard the news all went to the port to welcome her.</p>
<h3>Four More Accomplices Apprehended in Armed Robbery of French Water and Electricity Company</h3>
<p>On the morning of January 9th of this year, there was an armed robbery of a large sum of wages from the French Water and Electricity Company. The next day, the French police cracked the case, arresting eight members of the robbery gang, including Shen Chaoyu and Liang Honggen, who were sent to court and sentenced to imprisonment. On the 23rd of this month, the French police arrested three more members of the gang who were at large: Qiu Bukuan (aka Lao Qiu), Yu Shaoquan, and Meng Shanbiao, all from Funing. Two handguns, bullets, and other items were found in a shed behind the Jiangbei Guild Hall on Mayushan Road. Because some accomplices were still at large, Qiu and the other two were sent to the Special District Two Court for interrogation and detention. This was reported in this newspaper the day before yesterday. According to Qiu's confession, inspectors Chang Jiangfutian and Ji Xianshi of the French police, in conjunction with the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, arrested Xu Dalong (34 years old, from Funing) and Wang Jinsheng (24 years old, from Siyang) at 37 Kangjiaqiao, Xinjiapo Road, West Shanghai, and Wu Wanyou (42 years old, from Baoying) at 49 Xiaobangbian, Laobusheng Road, and Jiang Changqing (34 years old, from Yancheng) at 58 Lane 61, Laobusheng Branch Road. They were all taken back to the police station and sent to the Criminal Division of the Special District Two Court yesterday. Judge Sun Pengham questioned them. The police lawyer Fei Xizhen requested an adjournment until August 7th to investigate and prosecute the case together with Qiu Bukuan and others. The court briefly questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody and tried together with Qiu Bukuan and others on August 7th.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Merging Vegetable Stalls in the City</h3>
<p>Fuyou Road Stalls to be Merged into Fujia Street</p>
<p>Vegetable stalls on Fuyou Road in the city were banned and forcibly evicted by the Yi Miao police station in April of this year, causing a disturbance. All the stallholders petitioned the city government. It is now learned that the Municipal Police Bureau and the Finance Bureau issued a joint announcement yesterday, stating that the case had been discussed by representatives of the relevant bureaus convened by the Police Bureau, and it had been decided to merge the vegetable vendors into vacant stalls on Fujia Street (i.e., Huajin Road, County Left Street). The announcement urgently stated that the vegetable vendors in the area should register at the Municipal South Tax Collection Office of the Finance Bureau before the 30th of this month. At 1 p.m. on August 1st, a lottery will be held at the Yi Miao police station of the Police Bureau to determine the order of filling the vacant stalls, and no violations will be tolerated. However, the original stallholders on Fujia Street are greatly alarmed upon hearing this, fearing that their business will be encroached upon if the others are merged in. They have jointly issued a declaration refusing the merger, while the vegetable vendors on Fuyou Road have continued to petition the city government and the Police and Finance Bureaus separately, requesting that the order be rescinded and the status quo be maintained. Therefore, this dispute is difficult to resolve for the time being.</p>
<h3>Household Robbed on Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou</h3>
<p>Losses of More Than Two Hundred and Fifty Yuan</p>
<p>The household at 4 Chongdeli, Zhaofeng Road, Hongkou, was suddenly broken into by four robbers at around 5 a.m. yesterday morning. The robbers brandished handguns to prevent the occupants from making any noise. One robber stood guard over the family with a gun, while the others swarmed upstairs, ransacking boxes and chests. A large amount of legal tender and jewelry were stolen, with total losses of more than two hundred and fifty yuan. After the robbers succeeded, they fled through the door and disappeared without a trace. After the robbers left, the victim reported the incident to the local Huijiao police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Post Office Foreman Sentenced to Six Months for Stealing Letters</h3>
<p>Chen Zuji, a Cantonese first-class postal worker and foreman of the mailbox section at the Shanghai Postal General Office on North Sichuan Road, has served in the office for more than ten years. He is usually diligent in his work, and therefore has been promoted to the position of foreman of the mailbox section. Recently, Chen became addicted to jai alai, resulting in him being unable to make ends meet. He successively stole more than a hundred pairs of letters from the office, opened them privately, and appropriated any checks or stamps for himself. The matter was discovered by the postal authorities, who reported it to the police, who arrested Chen and sent him to the First District Court for interrogation and detention. This was reported in this newspaper yesterday. Judge Ye continued the hearing and determined the facts clearly, sentencing Chen Zuji to six months in prison.</p>
<h3>Small Fire at Bansongyuan</h3>
<p>Donkey Running Causes Fence to Catch Fire</p>
<p>Bansongyuan Garden in South Shanghai has been opening its night gardens every evening due to the summer season, attracting many tourists. Unexpectedly, at around 10:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, the fence of the donkey field at the rear of the garden caught fire due to a tourist dropping a lit cigarette butt on it. The fire quickly blazed up and became difficult to approach, causing great disorder. The garden staff immediately ordered the gardeners to try their best to extinguish the fire, and called the fire brigades of the various districts in South Shanghai, who drove to the scene. The fire was quickly extinguished, fortunately discovered early, causing little damage.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stated that the weather would be sunny and hot with southeasterly to southwesterly winds. Wind direction was uncertain in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the East China Sea would be cloudy, then sunny and hot, with gentle northeasterly to southeasterly winds. Taiwan would have thunderstorms and northwesterly winds. There was a low pressure area east of northern Luzon. The hurricane center at noon was located within approximately sixty miles of 36 degrees north latitude and 132 degrees east longitude, moving in a northeasterly direction. Wind force was unknown. Also, within the 24 hours before 3 p.m. yesterday, the highest temperature in this port was 93.6 degrees and the lowest was 71.8 degrees.

<h3>Rice Merchants Sue Jiang Shizhi for Checking Accounts Due to Unclear Use of Donations</h3>
<p>Also Accuse Lianyi Association During Yesterday's Court Hearing; Heated Debate on Both Sides, Adjourned for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Rice merchant Yuan Pinghe (37 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 18 Qinglongli, South Pier, Xinzha Bridge) hired lawyer Zhan Jifeng to sue Jiang Shizhi, chairman and director of the Shanghai North Shanghai Rice Merchants Lianyi Association, in the local court to check the accounts, including: ① handing over the income and expenditure books from the 21st year of the Republic to the end of June this year, ② the defendant bearing all litigation costs of the case. Yesterday, Judge Chen opened the court. The defendant's lawyer, Wen Renan, argued, and the judge asked what benefit the plaintiff sought. He replied that since he had paid donations, he had the right to check the accounts. At this point, the defendant requested that the plaintiff hand over the receipt to prove whether it was a receipt issued by the Rice Merchants Lianyi Association, and that the Fire Merchants Lianyi Association was a joint organization of rice merchants. The plaintiff was suing the defendant personally, which was inappropriate and clearly had other purposes. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that he requested to add the Rice Merchants Lianyi Association as one of the defendants in the case, with the defendant Jiang Shizhi listed as the legal representative. Therefore, he was adding the Lianyi Association to the lawsuit. The judge approved the procedure and continued the interrogation. The plaintiff stated that the rice merchants entrusted him with transportation, and he entrusted the Laogongmao Steamship Company to transport the goods to Shanghai. When they docked at the wharf, the association came to collect the money. He asked the association what the money was used for, but they ignored him. He had no choice but to request it legally. The judge asked if he had been entrusted by the rice merchants. He replied that he had been, but he had not brought the documents today and would submit them at the next hearing. At this point, the defendant stated that he did not agree with the plaintiff adding the Lianyi Association to the lawsuit and should file a separate lawsuit. The defendant's lawyer stated that he was entrusted by a part of Jiang, and the agent objected to adding the lawsuit. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer said that since he had no right to represent the Lianyi Association, what reason did he have to object? Whether the lawsuit could be added was up to the judge to decide. After a heated discussion between the two sides, the official hearing was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Summer Special</h3>
<p>The posture of heat, the temperature in the air, like the stock market manipulated by speculators, rises sharply from eighty degrees to ninety degrees, and even rises from ninety degrees, threatening to break through the hundred-degree mark. As a result, every round table in the cold drink shops is filled with customers. The waitresses, dressed like white butterflies, are so busy that the greasepaint on their faces is drenched with juice. Cicadas noisily chirp on the plane trees along the sidewalks. The sun seems angrily unwilling to descend towards the horizon. The ladies, though wearing voile cheongsams, baring two healthy and beautiful arms, and scheming for a pair of healthy and beautiful legs, are still not cool enough, so they have to extend their six inches of un-trousered skin into a pair of high heels fastened with only two straps. However, it is still okay not to go out. When you walk on the street, the asphalt pavement is scorched to a slightly soft state, so you naturally have to use a rickshaw as transportation. But the average rickshaw puller is just as annoying as the ladies imagine, because he is covered in the stench of sweat. And even more annoying is that after running for a while, he has to stop by the roadside and drink a few mouthfuls of free tea. These are weaving together a scene that is as hot as fire.</p>
<p>The four large characters "Air Conditioning Open" have appeared in a timely manner at the entrances of all the large dance halls, large theaters, large hotels, etc. All the large glass windows are painted with ice-like piles of wadding, which is so tempting. But perhaps this is not enough for the young masters to linger, so the swimming pool is crowded with merfolk-like amphibians. However, the beach bath is perhaps even more attractive, because sea bathing is not only beneficial to health, but also lying quietly on the beach, letting the natural sunlight tan you to a healthy and beautiful color, which is the most popular thing for Hollywood stars in recent years. It can be said to be modern to the extreme. As a result, the Takashimaya ferry is uniquely full of men and women escaping the heat. But looking back at the railings along the river in the city, there are quite a few vagrants who are not in the ranks of men and women, also using beautiful postures to plunge into the river, indulging in a swim and seeking a moment of coolness.</p>
<p>Hot! Hot, in every corner of this city, showing the posture of heat. But I hope that they will not reduce their enthusiasm for national affairs!</p>
<p>—(Hua Ling)</p>
<h3>Summer Essays</h3>
<p>—Zhu Ying</p>
<p>"The sun is hot like a fire, the rice paddies are half-scorched, the farmers' hearts are boiling, and the young masters wave their fans."</p>
<p>This song was sung by Bai Sheng in Water Margin. Although the sentences are very colloquial, yet only these twenty-eight words have fully painted the background of the hot summer, as well as the worried mood of the farmers, and the leisure of the young masters in the ivory tower.</p>
<p>Facts similar to this colloquial song are often discovered.</p>
<p>Just after lunch yesterday, I was sitting in a tea room. While drinking some cold drinks, I was enjoying the coolness of the electric fan. At about one thirty, suddenly a burst of noise occurred at the door. I hurried over to take a look, and it was a rickshaw puller who had collapsed from heatstroke while pulling a full cart of bricks past the tea room door. The bricks fell all over the ground, and the rickshaw puller was taken to the hospital in a car hired by a police officer.</p>
<p>At that time, a young man in the tea room specifically walked to the thermometer on the wall and took a look, then said to his companion faintly: "It's only slightly weaker than eighty-seven degrees, how could that guy have already suffered heatstroke. It's ridiculous that he can't stand the heat like that." As he spoke, he asked the waiter for a shaved ice.</p>
<p>Another thing that also happened yesterday was that a roommate of mine was buying a melon at the door.</p>
<p>Because the melon seller was asking for too high a price, my roommate loudly lectured him, saying that the countrymen are all black-hearted people, what is the value of the things they grow in their fields, when they are brought to Shanghai, everything is sold as mutton under the guise of dog meat, it is nothing less than robbing money.</p>
<p>But the melon seller calmly replied: "What do you Shanghainese know? We farmers are the ones who suffer. We get up early and sleep late, we are rained on and sun-baked, we carry manure and climb mud, and that's not even all. If it rains for several days in a row, or if it doesn't rain for several days in a row, or if pests occur, then we will really lose half our weight in anxiety. Watching the capital and labor all go to waste. These kinds of hardships are not something that Shanghainese who eat ice and turn on electric fans know."</p>
<p>Although this is just an ordinary dialogue, its meaning is quite profound.</p>
<h3>Two Kinds of Life in Shanghai Summer</h3>
<p>—Fang Zheng</p>
<p>The more civilized the material world, the easier it is to distinguish between the noble and the lowly lives in the city. Not to mention anything else, just the summer life in Shanghai is a representative work.</p>
<p>The summer seems to have nothing to do with the rich in Shanghai, because they live in high-rise buildings, eat soda and cold food, travel in ventilated, un-awning streamlined cars, and play in dance halls and cinemas equipped with 1937 standard air conditioning. However, people's hearts are never satisfied. When they get tired of playing, Guling, Qingdao, and Mogan become their must-go places. Anyway, as long as there is "legal tender," who would not welcome them?</p>
<p>Readers! Do not envy the extravagance of the rich. Let us turn back and look at the poor in Shanghai (especially the laboring class)! Summer is simply their great enemy, because even though the Fahrenheit thermometer is at 100 degrees, they still have to go out to work, pulling cars or doing labor! If they don't work for a day, they don't eat for a day, so heatstroke, heatstroke, and cholera are always with them. The evenings are even more difficult for them. In cramped shacks or small attics, the heat is high, and General Mosquito and Commander Stink exert their aggressive skills. I ask you, in this kind of situation, can you close your eyes and sleep peacefully? So they take the sky as a quilt and the ground as a bed (sleeping on the road). Although sometimes they are interfered with for "obstructing traffic," they have to swallow their anger.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that the great Shanghai, the Paris of the East, would have such a distorted development? Perhaps it is the gift of excessive material civilization? However, this is only one of them.</p>
<h3>Phoenix Nest Swap</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen (News Inquires in the Southern City, Yun Chuang Speaks of Dreams, Elegant Farewell on the Banquet, Qixiang Returns the Carriage)</p>
<p>Youmei smiled and said, "This is a different dream than the one my cousin had. But his attitude is indeed like this, I cannot lie to my cousin." Guoqi couldn't help but sigh and say, "His attitude is like this, it is entirely out of necessity. If there is an opportunity, he generally considers himself worthy of an accomplished woman." Youmei lowered her head and played with her handkerchief, only listening to his words, without replying. They sat together for a while, feeling quite bored. She then placed her hand on the coffee table, slowly stood up, and smiled, "I should say goodbye." Guoqi said, "You came from so far away. Why don't you sit here with me a little longer?" Youmei said, "There's nothing wrong with me sitting longer. It's just..." As she spoke, she glanced at Guoqi, smiling slightly. Guoqi said, "I think I should tell you what I mean." Youmei blushed and smiled, "Does my cousin have something else to say to me?" Guoqi said, "It's probably impossible to express my feelings in writing. I think there will always be a chance for Miss Li to meet him. When you see him, you can tell him what I said." Youmei said, "Tell him what? That your work wasn't intentional?" Guoqi said, "No, just tell him about my dream." Youmei bit the corner of her handkerchief in her mouth, straightened the bottom of her handkerchief, nodded twice, and said, "Ah! I understand my cousin's meaning." He explained to this point, without saying anything more, turned back with a short smile, and quickly left. Guoqi was absent-minded, feeling that Youmei's attitude in speaking today was not very natural, clearly she herself seemed to have some worries mixed in. So he put his hands behind his back and paced back and forth in the room. Waiting for Old Mrs. Dong to say in the hall, "The meal is almost ready, why don't you eat before you leave?" Youmei said, "I'll come back another day to bother you." Only then did he realize that Youmei had left. He thought to himself, how could she leave without even saying goodbye to me? This clearly also shows she doesn't want to talk to me. From this day on, his heart felt even more uncomfortable, at home he just closed the door and read, when he went out he wildly toured famous places and historical sites. If there was a companion, he would travel with them. If there was no companion, he would still have a great time alone. One day, the Shanghai Magazine Company sent him a稿費, totaling more than fifty dollars. He suddenly had a burst of豪興, he clapped his hands and said, "Life is only a few decades, only going toward piles of烦恼, that's simply being a傻子. Now that I have money, I want to have a痛痛快快 good time!" So he changed into a new suit, put all the banknotes in his pocket, and went to Zhu Xiaosong's house. Before he even got to his house, he met him at the entrance of the alley, sitting in a bright, copper-covered, painted carriage. (201)</p>
<h3>Random Talk About Fans</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>There are many types of fans. Their names are determined by their form. Foldable ones are called "folding fans," round ones are called "round fans," those made of banana leaves are called "banana leaf fans," and those woven from cattails are called "cattail fans." There are also those made from dyed bird feathers, sometimes called "young mistress's fans," which are not for creating wind but for show, for adornment only.</p>
<p>Given the status of a young mistress, she wouldn't have to fan herself. Modern science is advanced, and electric fans can rotate their heads, creating a whirring sound, which can be enjoyed with an open collar. When she goes out, the grand ballroom has air conditioning, and the night garden has a gentle breeze. A light feather fan is just like a handbag. It can be useless but must be carried. Sometimes she opens it to cover half her face, and instead of using words, she uses her eyebrows and eyes. The wonderful use of a young mistress's fan lies in this. In the past, people often used fans to cover their faces, so fans were also called "bian mian" (convenient face). This posture can still be seen in old dramas.</p>
<p>The side effects of fans are not limited to this. The folding fan of a storyteller is ever-changing. When talking about "royal princes," they can use the fan to express a "romantic and dashing" appearance. For bullies and rascals, they only need to brush the fan under their nose or insert it into the back of their neck under the collar. When talking about "Zhang Fei shouting at Ba Lin Bridge," his fan can transform into an "eighteen-foot spear." When talking about "General with Double Spears, Lu Wenlong," his fan can transform into double spears. The steel whip of the Eight Princes, Huang Tianba's single sword, even the petition for redress, and the letter of the red-haired ghost Liu Tang can all be represented by the fan. Therefore, some people say: If a storyteller doesn't have a folding fan in hand, they cannot tell a story. Even if they do, they will be as stiff as a wooden chicken, not at all lively.</p>
<p>There is also a type of person who has no other skills, relying on their silver tongue, specializes in "sowing discord" between people. They tell Zhang San what Li Si is like in front of Zhang San, and then tell Li Si what Zhang San is like in front of Li Si. This action is called "fanning small fans." No matter what the matter, after they fan it, success is not enough, and failure is more than enough. There are many such "small fans" in society. Be careful first!</p>
<p>I've digressed. Let's talk about the original purpose of fans.</p>
<p>People have elegance and vulgarity, and fans also have elegance and vulgarity. Folding fans and round fans are elegant. Banana leaf fans and cattail fans are vulgar. Men of letters and scholars, ladies and maidens, are elegant. Laborers and coolies, maids and old women, are vulgar. Elegant people use elegant fans, so they often have decorations of calligraphy and paintings by famous people. Vulgar people use vulgar fans, so they can only use scraps of cloth to sew the edges. Xiao Lingzi knows a few characters and can write a little, but at most she is limited to folk sayings like "The fan creates a cool breeze, fans in summer but not in winter, if someone asks to borrow it, wait until mid-August." It is difficult to enter the hall of great elegance.</p>
<h3>Takahashi Seaside Bathing Beach</h3>
<p>— Luo Zheng</p>
<p>Summer has arrived. Summer is the season for swimming. Therefore, in the past few days, as long as we randomly enter any swimming pool, we can see those merfolk active in the water.</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon, braving the nearly hundred-degree heat, we boarded the municipal ferry to Takahashi. Then, the ship, amidst a cacophony of voices, left the double-deck pier and headed into the Huangpu River. The wind blew from the surface of the Huangpu River, dissipating the hot, sun-baked water vapor, leaving only boundless coolness around everyone. The sharp-nosed, upturned-tail划子, the wooden boats with their large sails raised, all crowded and swayed on the Huangpu River, decorating this Huangpu River like a lively sketch, like a beautiful prose poem.</p>
<p>When the boat arrived at Takahashi Town, we all struggled out of the ferry, climbed onto a bus, and let it carry us forward like we were flying. The car raised dust behind it, while the oily green fields on both sides unfolded before us. After passing many wooden bridges and walking through a long cinder road, we saw the palatial bathing beach gate, towering majestically above countless stone steps. After getting off the bus, we climbed the steps, with a relaxed heart, and walked into the seaside bathing beach.</p>
<p>A broad stone road stretched to a small lake. Various flowers were planted along the road, and many fishing platforms were built along the lake, specifically for visitors to fish and rest. There was also a pavilion in the center of the lake, with red railings and green tiles, full of ancient charm. Standing in the pavilion, leaning on the railing and looking around, the magnificent sea view of ten thousand acres of misty waves and sky, as well as the sails, islands, sea swallows, and white gulls, were all within view. Passing around the small lake, there was a row of houses, which included changing rooms, rest rooms, tea rooms, and offices.</p>
<p>In the changing room, we changed into our swimsuits, went down the stone steps, stepped on the soft fine sand, walked to the seashore, and gasped under the intense sun. The sea, panting under the strong sun, had its face flushed with a reddish-gold color. However, because the wind was not strong, the sea water seemed very calm. It only gently kissed the colorful pebbles on the beach, occasionally making a few laughing sounds.</p>
<p>A group of merfolk冲了海水, so the golden sea waves were disturbed. Red, green, black, white, all kinds of swimsuits, permed and smooth hair, and those healthy and sickly legs and arms, were interwoven on the sea. However, those who were not good at swimming only crawled slowly on the beach, watching many experienced swimmers dive into the deepest part of the water.</p>
<p>Jumping, swimming.</p>
<p>The red buoys floating on the sea surface were the boundary of the swimming area, and the wooden figures standing upright in the water were the signs of deep and shallow water. Blue lifeboats and lifeguard boats constantly patrolled the sea surface. The bamboo rafts were floating on the water, and the tide warning signs were also erected on the beach. All of these were safety equipment.</p>
<p>A long row of blue and white awnings were arranged on the beach, triangular, like tents for Boy Scouts camping; there were also newly added square canvas awnings this year, like small涼亭, very spacious, and could accommodate seven or eight people inside. Behind the awnings was a row of凉房, square and upright, each with glass and screen windows, the rooms were all furnished with beds, benches, and chairs, and tables and chairs were also placed on the corridor outside the rooms. It was really a good place to enjoy the cool and avoid the heat.</p>
<p>Time in joy seemed to slip away particularly quickly. A slanting sun had already fallen below the horizon. So, the young men and women who had escaped from the city and plunged into the embrace of nature reluctantly put on their clothes and left the seaside bathing beach.</p>
<p>The bus and the ferry, carrying a group of sea-loving people, still seemed to send them back to the city.</p>
<h3>Occasional Records of Sights and Sounds</h3>
<p>— (Yu Sansi)</p>
<p>Comfortable Enjoyment</p>
<p>Mr. Wu is a clear-headed person. He speaks very reasonably. Yesterday, he said to people, "It is really impossible to avoid the heat in summer. If there is a cool place, then it is good to enjoy it. For example, buying medicines and hygiene products at the Wuzhou Pharmacy on Fourth Road, where there is air conditioning, a cold drink section, sofas, benches, and chairs, and the prices are low and the goods are complete. All kinds of situations will make the body and mind feel comfortable."</p>
<p>Bathing Experience</p>
<p>The beautiful Miss Chen, she has the nickname "Miss Shanghai". She takes a bath almost every day in the summer, and she must use "Yalin Safer" and "Wuzhou Talcum Powder" every time, because putting "Yalin Safer" in the water during a bath can disinfect, and using "Wuzhou Talcum Powder" all over the body after a bath is refreshing, so these two things have become her essential items.</p>

<h3>Explanation of "Rats Moving Their Nest"</h3>
<p>— Zhen Shilin</p>
<p>People in the city, if they don't own their own house, are bound to move their nest. For Shanghai people, moving several times a year is not a big deal. However, it is said that moving is not allowed in June and December, perhaps because it is too hot or too cold. After moving, if the empty room cannot be rented out, the landlord will suffer. In fact, there are exceptions to this, such as Chinese residents in the Hongkou area, who do not distinguish between winter and summer!</p>
<p>In the past two days, because of—probably a rumor—the residents of Hongkou have been thrown into chaos again. Although someone shouted "Calm down" from the side, it didn't have much effect. People were still using small carts or horse-drawn carriages to transport washbasins, chamber pots, and luggage. In such hot weather, doing such hard work is really like looking for trouble! People who have just arrived in Shanghai, seeing this situation, cannot help but sigh and say: "This is simply rats moving their nest!"</p>
<p>This metaphor, of course, has some sarcasm, but it is quite accurate. Rats are the most fond of moving their nest. Today they make a nest in the corner of the east wall, and tomorrow they dig a hole in the corner of the west wall, as if they are born with this active temperament and do not feel any trouble when moving. Shanghai people living in the Hongkou area (in other areas, there is not much difference) move several times a year, which is equivalent to routine business, and there is nothing to say about any effort. Because they move so often, their nerves seem to be a little numb, so when they start to move, they don't feel any reaction, and sometimes they don't even know why they need to move, only subconsciously thinking that they should move when they need to move.</p>
<p>This is no different from rats, and even more like "cowardly as a rat!" Rats are probably the most cowardly, so they cower and hide, and come out at night and hide during the day. Shanghai people have always been good at the ability to hide during the day and come out at night, and they are even more flexible than rats when cowering and hiding. It seems that dangerous areas have been "strictly demarcated", and bullets and shells have eyes and will never "lightly cross the Thunder Pond" by even one step. The sharpness of their vision is truly comparable to that of rats.</p>
<p>But human beings are the soul of all things, and should not belittle themselves in this way. Moving is possible, but it should be absolutely free. If you love to move, you can move once a day, but you should not be passive, like people in the Hongkou area. And you should not be so numb, hoping that after moving this time, the world will be peaceful, and then moving back in a day or two.</p>
<p>I think that at least everyone who has moved their nest should study the reason why they moved, and then try to prevent such a passive move from happening continuously. Only in this way can we truly find the way to move our nest freely.</p>
<p>But the people of Shanghai are pitiful! They often don't think about these issues. Under heavy pressure, they only want to secretly enjoy themselves in the short rest time, and even regard this "secret mood" as a way to satisfy themselves. Therefore, this society is made to be dull and lifeless. Everyone is just cowering and hiding, seeking momentary peace, and events like "rats moving their nest" will continue forever.</p>
<p>This is truly sad!</p>

<h3>What the 'Taiping Heavenly Kingdom' Tells Us</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom is already a historical relic, and history will never repeat itself, but the results it has left behind can be used as a reference for our practice. The performance of the 'Taiping Heavenly Kingdom' can be said to have given us a great hint from this positive meaning, especially at the moment, it indicates which path we should take, and which path is wrong and should not be taken.</p>
<p>In that play, it was shown that the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom adapted to the objective situation at the time, relying on the power of the masses, and laid its foundation. In the middle, Yang Xiuqing's abuse of power once caused the troops to be kept in place and not dispatched, which put the overall situation in a dangerous situation. At that time, several leaders opposed Yang Xiuqing's dictatorship, and disagreements arose between them, and the situation almost disintegrated. The masses also rose up to accuse them, and as a result, Yang Xiuqing had to send troops. In order to take care of the overall situation, several leaders also abandoned their personal grudges and continued to work together, and thus turned the crisis into safety.</p>
<p>What does this illustrate? When the overall situation is in danger, everyone must work together to save the country, and absolutely should not have more opinions. We should put the overall situation first. If we disregard the overall situation and still have opinions in private, it will inevitably lead to reduction. Just like the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, the end was due to infighting, which resulted in reduction. (This performance is the first part of 'Taiping Heavenly Kingdom'! Jintian Village) This is the best lesson for us, and we should keep it firmly in mind.</p>
<p>Now our country is approaching the most critical moment. Should everyone still have private opinions at this time? 'Brothers quarrel at the wall, but defend against insults from outside'. Everyone should immediately abandon their prejudices, gather the national manpower, financial resources, and material resources, and unite to save the country! This is the recognition we should have after watching 'Taiping Heavenly Kingdom'.</p>
<h3>Sea</h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>The sea is vast and tranquil.</p>
<p>The sea has a long history, a long civilization, abundant treasures, and strong power. Around the sea, there are countless fishermen, all of whom covet it maliciously. They use eagle-like sharp eyes, and wolf-like brutal hearts, to seek every target that can be seized, every opportunity that can be attacked on the sea.</p>
<p>The sea itself is kind, gentle, and has a deep sense of humility.</p>
<p>No matter how the fishermen bully, or even slaughter, she tolerates, humbles, and always shows the nature of a peaceful person, always trying to portray a peaceful person's bold and generous heart, which is absolutely different from the fishermen's barbarism and greed. Use the victory of the spirit to suppress the injustice in your heart.</p>
<p>Except for ruling the aquatic creatures and drowning ignorant and arrogant little lives, the sea is always calm and tranquil, and never thinks of tides and waves—unless it is the moon's temptation and the wind's propulsion.</p>
<p>Peace, patience! This is the legacy of the sages. The ancient philosophical style is also the nature of the sea. Even this nature has made her weak, incompetent and cowardly. Fishermen's warships, fishing boats, and smugglers arbitrarily run over her body, arbitrarily carry out slaughter and infringement: arbitrarily occupy the territory, and build fishing camps in her hinterland. She only endures and succumbs, does not resist, and allows the shame to increase again and again.</p>
<p>Sometimes the self-comfort of spiritual victory will also lose the power to control everything: hatred and accumulated anger will break through the gate of tranquility and ignite the flames of resistance. So the sea was furious, she wanted to jump up and roar, to give the fishermen a strong answer. But she immediately lost her courage again, hesitating, weakening, anger turned into pain and depression, she could only quietly sigh to the evening moon, and groan in the darkness of the long night.</p>
<p>There was a time when the sea roared wildly, she broke all the chains, abandoned all the cowardice and submission; in order to wash away all the shame, to avenge all the hatred, she roared, rolled up huge waves, submerged the sun's fierce flames, submerged the fishermen's nets, and won a great victory, winning the glory that shocked the universe!</p>
<p>Perhaps from then on, the sea would become a truly peaceful country, and there would be no more fishermen's exploitation or the sun's ravages. This glorious victory would be the true beginning of peace. But the gentle and cowardly nature immediately succumbed to the abuse of power, letting her own hands obliterate the great glory, and write the big characters of shame on her own cheeks.</p>
<p>Today, the sea is in danger. Every corner of the sea is full of fishermen's vicious schemes, and full of the sun's aggressive tyranny. If she does not cheer up again, she will be completely swallowed.</p>
<p>All the molecules that make up the sea, the whole body of the sea, are roaring. The sea will stir up boundless giant waves, submerge the sun's iron hooves, submerge the fishermen's nets, and build a solid city wall on the periphery of the sea with flesh and blood, as a guarantee of true peace!</p>
<h3>One Day</h3>
<p>— Rui Lin</p>
<p>On the side of the dirty river, people are used to dumping garbage on the open space, and over time, a garbage mountain gradually accumulates, and then gradually flattens. So people built lawns on it, and built simple tile houses! Because of shoddy workmanship and the washing of wind and rain, it gradually declined. Seeing the broken wall covered with broken reed mats, it makes people feel a little melancholy.</p>
<p>The fictitious foundation is buried in the filthy mud, and the tile houses and thatched huts are connected like a street. The town stands proudly on the banks of the dirty river.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the street is floating with light red, light green, and spinach and eggplants are placed on the vegetable stalls on the side of the road. The vegetable leaves are splashed with clear water, and the water droplets are rounded and condensed into crystal beads. When the water droplets touch each other, they roll down along the leaf stem.</p>
<p>"This one catty——". "Ten-one for one catty". "Will you sell nine for one catty"? "Fourteen taels for one catty". So they each mumbled. The vegetable basket swayed and walked away.</p>
<p>It's just a copper coin, and they refuse to give in even a little bit, arguing with red faces, without any shyness, this stinginess is habitual.</p>
<p>The morning market is over, and they count the little money in their waist bag: thinking about the many wasted sweat, they go home unhappily.</p>
<p>The quiet midday is ignited by the scorching sun, and the dog pants with a scorched red tongue, with a trace of sticky saliva trailing from the tip of the tongue. People are like dogs, naked, sweat crawls on the skin like tiny oil droplets, flies hover over the heads of dozing people, licking the salty sweat, and spreading a little filth. The person selling ice water watched as the ice melted in the sun, and one piece of capital melted like ice. In this year, there are no people eating ice or eating melons, a melancholy summer.</p>
<p>At dusk, a sultry green wind blows from the dirty river surface. The people from one 田 family go to see the river water that dries up every day, and when they look up, it is a sky full of stars, and tomorrow is another hot day.</p>
<p>The hot summer is their reason, so the old, the young, and the women can all sleep in the open air. One mat is for a family. Each snoring, the little life made of broken cotton suddenly cries哇哇, the crying seems to be the little life's panting.</p>
<p>"Alas, alas, little one, you've caught a cold, your hands and feet are feverish." The mother, despite holding her, the child is still crying.</p>
<p>"Don't cry. Good boy, look, the house is like a fiery pit." The mother seems to be annoyed and grabs the crying child and walks into the house. The crying gradually weakens. It seems to be fading away.</p>
<p>This is a melancholy summer!</p>
<h3>How Should We Develop Our News Drama?</h3>
<p>— Ke Yu</p>
<p>The Chinese Playwrights Association, in order to implement drama to save the nation, is collectively creating a national defense script "Defend Lugou Bridge" by all playwrights, which will soon be performed. Now that the drama situation is changing, news drama is even more important. It gives people a real, active, and profound impression. It easily excites the audience and increases resistance forces.</p>
<p>As for the most convenient and necessary ways to develop news drama, they are naturally living newspapers, street plays, and current affairs reports. The living newspaper is a type of light cavalry-style short variety show in drama, originally introduced from the Soviet Union. Its task is to report new social situations and political news in an interesting way at any time. Naturally, under the current strong atmosphere of resistance against the war, it can most practically exert its great power of 'awakening the masses.' Street plays and current affairs reports, like living newspapers, do not require stages, sets, or special makeup. They can all be performed anywhere. The difference is that current affairs reports only use simple news. In addition to reporting, they also need to critique current affairs. The popular makeup lectures belong to this type.</p>
<p>In the process of advancement, we must change the performance methods at any time according to the local situation. The content of the script must be supplemented and modified with brand new current affairs news at any time. Of course, the more accurate the news, the better. At the same time, we can distribute current affairs booklets with simple text and easy-to-understand illustrations, or teach salvation songs, and publicize wartime defense common sense.</p>
<p>It's time! We hope that the forward-thinking playwrights will give us more popular scripts for us to perform. We also hope that the public will work together to create and innovate automatically. This news drama that matches current affairs is the most suitable and the most popular.</p>
<p>It's time! We hope that the forward-thinking actors will move your troupes to towns and villages as much as possible, and we also hope that all regions will respond and organize automatically!</p>
