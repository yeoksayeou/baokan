<h3>新運三週紀念蔣氏廣播演講（續昨）</h3>
<p>㊀切實推行、勿事鋪張、我們推行新生活運動、必須要有“實事求是”的精神、須知新生活運動、乃是一種社會運動、應當要拿從事社會運動的精神來做、而不能以做政治工作的方法來做、更不應當專做官樣文章“等因奉此”的來虛應故事、須知改移風氣的事情、决不是一紙空文所能辦到的、必須切實的做去、方能得到眞正的效果、我看到各地新運會的刊物、其中大半是公函開會紀錄和演説詞、而關於工作成續的記載倒少、這都是沒有拿出“實事求是”的精神來幹、而是辦事不肯認眞的明證、過去的工作、在推行方面、標語多而工作少、方案多而實行少、在推行對象方面、衹注意到社會的上層、而未及於下層、只注意到通衢馬路、而未及於街頭巷尾、所以三年來新運的結果、祇做到表面一時的更新、而未達到永遠澈底的改革、此後我們做新運工作的人、必須要注意到一般民衆實際生活的改善、少做粉飾的宣傳、應以家庭做推行新運的出發點、鄉村為推行新運的中心、而以一般民衆作對象、以身作則、自已先實行新生活、再來勸導他人、那末工作的效果、必然廣大迅速、若然專以貼標語寫公文、作為推行新生活運勁、那末新運的前途、不言而喻了、</p>
<p>㊁集中力量、貫澈到底、新生活的目的、是為復興民族，責任重大，範圍廣闊、當然不是我們三天二日所能做得到的事情、所以在推行的步驟上、必須由近致遠、由淺及深、即如我們若然能够做到初步工作“規矩”“清潔”兩項、全國都能做得澈底、那麽對於民族復興的運動上、已經有了不少的貢獻、所以我們以後要擇定中心工作、切實推行、不可好高騖遠、結果是什麽都做、什麽都做不好、過去的許多方案辦法、就犯了這個毛病、表面上非常週到、事實上一點都做不到、以後我們務必力改此弊、擇定中心工作、劃分步驟、按期施行、集中力量、來達到我們的目標、</p>
<p>（三）以身作則、推已及人、凡做一切社會運勁的工作、必須具有偉大的人格、和能用赤誠感化、他人之力量、所以新生活運動的推行、絕少依靠政治之力量，而必須大家以身作則來做、“潛移默化”的功夫、因為法律這樣束西、衹能呌人家不許做壞事、而不能鼓勵人家做好事、若然要改移風氣、必須要有社會制裁的力量、精神灌注的方法、方能有效、不然我們推行新生活運動之初、為什麽不用政府的命令去强制執行、而注重於領導的人之自身修養、要用“潛移默化”的方法來推己及人呢、社會的積習、是千百年來所遺留下來的改變自屬不易、所以必須用精誠來感化、於是才能“金石為開”了、我們若然自已不實行新生活、而偏呌他人去實行新生活、那便是缺少精誠、虛僞醜惡、莫此為甚、</p>
<p>（四）簡樸動儉、表裹一致、“簡單”、“樸素”是新生活運動中兩個重要綱領也是實行動勞和儉約的基礎、簡樸的對面、就是浮靡和繁費、這是與建國工作、絕對有妨的現在無論那一個國家、當其艱苦建國、無不是政府社會上下一致、以動儉為本、以簡單樸素是尚、而後可以省出有用的物力時力人力來救國、新生活運動推行之始，大家頗能注意到這一點、例如宴客、不但是確定時間、而且也崇尚節約、力戒浪費、但不久又恢復從前的狀况、餚饌過多、靡費太甚、一切漫無限制、枉耗時閒、枉耗精神、何等可惜、大家或以為此是小節、要知我們要建立一個現代國家、就要百事從小的地方做起、一切事無不是積微成著、積少成多、總由不明革命建國之大道、所以知而不行、行而不久、而且往往衹做了表面、我從前在外國留學、親見外國一般大學生、早晨出來賣報送牛奶、白天讀書、不但是借此可以補助學費、養成自立基礎、而且也養成了躬親細故、實行動儉的習慣、眞覺得非常之羨慕、這是我們中國學生亦應該效法的、又如現在德國一般青年、往往親自做收拾廢紙破布鐵片等工作、把一切微細無用的物件、收集起來、利用加工儲備作物質建設的材料、我們中國一般家庭中間、凡是隱蔽所在、無不是廢紙狼籍、汚穢散漫、毫不注意、即如南京所有較大的馬路、表面上似乎很清潔、但如果到馬路兩旁或街巷內細細察看、就常常可以發現門前堆積了散亂的紙屑布條和垃圾、學校裏也往往如此、甚至教室內的黑板也沒有人揩拭、苟且偷懶、視若無覩、這標還請什麽清潔、什麽勞動呢、即如服裝一項、好多學生穿了制服面把帽子歪藏着、或是把襯衣露在制服外面、這比不着制服還要不好、而且失了穿着制服的本意、絕對説不上整齊和禮節與儀容了、這不過舉食衣住行的一個例子、其他不合時代的生活、還數不勝數、這種表裏不一、始終不慣的毛病、都是由於不明新運本旨、不能把新生活運動與救國方法連起來、我們眞要樹立新風氣救國、建國必須厲行簡樸、實行勤儉、而且要澈裏澈外、澈始澈終的來做綫好、</p>
<p>㊄精誠熱烈、自強不息、這一點我們特別要提出來勉勵諸位、負責推行新生活運動的同人、在本年度的工作上、務必要做到這兩點的勸告、我從前已經説過、過去我們習性上有兩種最大的缺點、是一般事業沒有推步、趕不上列强的主因、第一是缺乏精神與熱烈、第二是缺乏繼續不斷的精神、因為不是發於眞誠、所以開始的時候、雖很緊張、稍久就不免流於弛怠、凡事衹求對付過去、不求實際效果、所以外國人譏笑我們只有三分鐘熱度、又因為缺乏熱烈的情緒、對於任何事情、便覺得不起勁、雖然不是有意懈怠、但終鼓不起奮迅向前的氣慨、結果便不免近於虛應故事、至於第二點、我們如果缺乏繼續不斷自强不息的精神、不但進行不能迅速、而且已有的成續、也往往不能保持，所以古人説日新又新、精益求精、這兩句格言就是新生活運動的眞精神、這幾句話、雖然我去年已經講過、但是我認為是極端重要、所以再提出鼓勵各位、以上各點、是我對於負責推行新生活運動者的貢獻、對於我們一般國民、有很大的關係、要知“天下興亡、匹夫有責、”現在國難已經到了最後嚴重的關頭、若然不是每一個人都負起救亡圖存復興民族的責任來、國家便減少了很大的希望、民族復興的日期、便因之而延宕下去、新生活運動的本旨、是要以禮義廉恥的四維、完全表現在每一個人的食衣住行上面、始終不懈的實行下去、使我們個人以至於社會、德智體羣的四育、都能够日新又新、道德一天天的高尚、智識一天天的增進、體格一天天的强健、合羣互助的精神、一天天的加增、不但個入如此、還要使全社會和全國同胞、人人能如此、而後我們國家繞能够從根本上挽救起來、我們的民族也一定能復興、我們現在既已認定新生活運動是復興民族唯一的途徑、那未、我們每一個國民都應當切實實行新生活、切實推行新生活、由小而大、推己及人，達到日新又新的地步、希望同胞們從今天起不再觀望，下一個决心、來努力於復興民族的奠基工作、（中央社十九日電）</p>

<h3>到百靈廟去</h3>
<p>— 本報記者錢華</p>
<p>蒙古草地百餘里無人烟　塞外冰雪前綫將土生活</p>
<p>現在各國流行着國防第一的口號，學摩登的國人當然也就跟着喊得一片價響。自從綏戰登生以來，國防建設的呼聲更彌漫乎全國，一批一批的慰勞視察團體，像巨浪似的湧進了綏遠，專趕熱鬧的新聞記者更不能例外。於是沉寂巳久的歸化古城，從新恢復了意想不到的繁榮，而所謂國防通訊也陸續散見在各報紙和雜誌上，成爲第一流的應時文章。在下早就想到戰地去觀光番，湊個趣兒，但是公私蝟集，</p>
<p>直延到一月十三日方才成行，乘滬平通車北上，轉平綏路到綏遠，再赴百靈廟等處，沿途在天津北平張家口大同平地泉包頭各地都有勾留，於二月五日返滬。各地停留視察的時間少則數小時，多不過五六天，像這樣走馬燈式的旅行，那裏還談得到什麽觀察。幸沿途友好供給許多有興味的材料，車上旅邸都有意外的收穫，再證以實地視察所得，一鱗半爪，拉雜紀述下來。在關心國防前綫的讀者。也許會感到些興味罷。</p>
<p>㊀西北軍事要塞</p>
<p>百靈廟在陰山北面，距歸化城三百三十里，距武川縣二百四十里，汽車一天可到，位於蒙古高原，海拔約二千公尺。其地勢四圍皆山，中間一片平原，岡巒環合，清溪縈繞，山勢險峻雄拔，易守難攻。自從熱河淪亡，察北六縣相報失陷以後，綏遠便成為西北諸省的屏障，冀蔽山西陝西，綏遠不守，秦晋便非我所有，整個西北更岌岌難保。就綏遠的地勢論，陰山山脈橫亘全省中部，成為一天然的長城，而百靈廟却又是陰山的瀋籬，百靈廟如在敵人手中，綏遠就無時無刻不受人家的威脅。正面可以窺武川，越陰山，直搗歸化；側面可以擾固陽，取包頭，拊我背部，使我軍首尾不得相顧。故事實上百靈廟已成為今日西北唯一的軍事要塞，蔣委員長曾鄭重表示：“百靈廟之收復，實爲吾民族復興之起點，亦卽我安危之最大關鍵。”此話不僅指民族精神方面來講，對於行軍地勢方面，實含有至重大的意義。地理學者張其昀氏在中國新論上發表一篇綏遠省軍事地理一文，説明百靈廟地勢的特殊重要，於國防建設上極有見地。他説：“陰山在秦漢時為中國與匈奴的國界，現代綏遠省境兼有山前山後，此古今國勢不同處，故目前軍事要塞必須向北推進。從前賽憲勒銘燕然，燕然就是杭愛山，在外蒙古杭愛山一帶作軍事准備，在民國初年尚能做到，但今日國軍的責任，應堅守綏遠境內的蒙古高原，黃河淮水間多平原，衹有徐州附近小山歷落，為兵家必爭的地方。百靈廟地勢的重要，也就是這個緣故。其地周圍邱陵起伏凡九座，好像城郭一樣，白靈河流貫其問，河東為市街，就是漢蒙貿易所在。河西為喇嘛寺，寺側有蒙古包數十座，從前蒙古地方自治政委會就在此辦公。百靈廟為西北交通要道，對內請一路經武川通歸綏，一路經固陽通包頭；對外講，一路通外蒙古，一路通新疆。所以此次克復百靈廟的意義實異常重大。因此可以消除外人對於綏北的威脅，斷絕其西進之路。我們希望國軍於此建設極堅固的軍事要塞，永絕覬覦之心。但是蒙古高原地形平易，樹木絕無僅有，飛機窺伺甚為瞭然。希望我空軍担負起保衛領空的責任來。”（未完）</p>

<h3>抗戰的前幕</h3>
<p>— 葉公超</p>
<p>不用預言家來推測，我們也不要奢想，“九一八”以後我們不戰而失掉的土地再不會不戰而轉落到別人手裏，更不會不戰而送還我們。換句話説，我們將來非戰不能收復一寸失地，非戰不能拯救三千萬水深火熱中的同胞。最近國內各方面的與論已明顯地告訴我們，現在全國的人民已然認清了這點。就是割據的軍閥與投機的策士們也只能運用“一致對外”的口號來做“混水裏捉魚”的勾當。政府六年來並無禦侮的事寶而仍能得着一般人民擁護者，也正因爲人民相信政府是在積極地建設基本的禦防工作，相信政府確有收復失地的决心，相信它今後不會一再“九一八”式地放棄寸士了。這一綫禦侮的希望竟影響到我們各方面的態度。我們理想的政治或經濟制度，我們理想的領袖人物的才能，乃至於我們平素渴望的什麽“思想自由”，“平等機會”等等，這時侯，在准備抗敵與收復失地的條件之下，都可暫時放下。時至今日，理論，哲學，主義都應當放回原處。這不是思想單純化，而是迫切圖存的代價。我們希望政府了解，為什麽人民在緊急關頭上擁護它，服從它，更希望蔣介石先生想想，為什麽大家（包括許多非英雄崇拜者）這樣關懷他的安全，擁戴他的統治。同時，我們還希望黨國要人們注意：“九一八”以後，人民對於南京政府的感想最近才開始逐漸轉好，因為一般稍有知識而無背景的人似乎都感覺政府近來確有相當的成績，這成續和我們禦侮的希望有正比例的關係；抗戰是我們民族唯一生存的希望，而為政府計，為國民黨計，也只有這一條生路。</p>
<p>有許多人想，我們的戰鬥力永不會達到够上抗敵的程度：我們在准備，人家當然也在准備，而且我們的速率未必能超過人家的多少，所以我們事實上非借用外力來牽制敵人不可。於是，有主張聯俄的，有主張乞憐於英美的，有主張以聯日或親日為根本解决的，而至今還有主張等待國聯再抬頭的。在專家的眼中，我相信這些主張都有各自的複雜性，但是這裏我們似乎用不着借用專家的知識。我們可以用幾絛常識的原則來檢討它們。我們都知道，國際間關係凡用到“聯”字，而其需要不在彼此間的關係，却在共同應付第三國的時候，雙方必然是，在彼此尊重主權的原則之下，有能互助的地方，如法俄之對德，日德之對俄。同時，聯盟國如要維持互助的精神，它們彼此的力量應當是相差不多；否則必有一國是處於被保護的地位，結果雙方就不能立於平等的地位了，而國際間又似乎還沒有免費護衛的辦法。試問中日或中俄間的情形能否適合於這種互助的條件。簡單地説，我們現在的力量既够不上聯日，亦够不上聯俄。即使我們需要聯日，或聯俄，我們也要先做到有聯人或被人聯的資格才成。至於親日，那根本就不成為一種辦法，我們對它唯有反對到底。國際能否再“抬頭”，我們非專家者不敢妄論；不過，就是它的頭抬起來了，我個人也懷疑對於我們能有多大的實際幫助。假使再來一個調查團，我們至多是再花上一二百萬的招持費與准備招待費，他們當然也會再作一份報告，我們的專家又可以多得幾百或幾千個此較凖確的數目字，智識份子再多發表幾篇論文。此外一切，我敢説，只有依然如故。東四省依然在人家掌握中，在灰色的夢中特殊化的區域還不過是繼續地“明朗化”。一位英國的名記者説得不錯，國聯已成為一個國際問題的冷氣箱了。這話我們中國人應當特別欣賞吧！英美在遠東各有其利益，各有關顧。凡與它們的利益，它們的勢力衝突的國家，它們對它當然是相常的戒備。假使有人在計算英國的殖民地，英國當然要對它禦防：假使有人要把持中國的商塲，而英國在中國已有相當商業的根據，英國人當然也要想辦法的。他們的辦法也許於我們有直接或間接的利益，或許有樓會我們能停在人家的簷下暫避一下風雨。不過，我們不要忘記，英國是個老成持重的國家，雖然有時也會上歐洲人的當，但是對於中國畢竟不如對於印度那樣關注；而且任何侵略中國者，只要對它担保决不向它的殖民地方面發展，我們焉如道，在相當環境之下它不會與這侵略者對於我們成立一種“紳士諒解”之類的協定？譬如，假使日本决定推進大陸政策，而無條件地放棄海洋政策，英國對它的態度怎樣，我們是沒有把握的。</p>
<p>這番顯而易見的話本用不着説，只是因爲自己的力量確乎是薄弱，而侵略者的爪牙實在來得兇暴，有許多同胞因此難免不會發生種種過分的奢望。外交方面的奢望愈大，我們的自信心愈低；自信心愈低，統一與抗敵愈難實現。外交當然是需要的，因為事實告訴我們，今後任何二國的戰爭都有掀動世界大戰的可能，况且事實上雙方的陣壘已然形成了，我們似乎非准備加入一方面不可。但是，憑我們現在這一點實力，任一方面也不會歡迎我們的，除非我們甘願作人家的奴隸，或永世的“華工”。我們現在只有埋頭拚命建設我們的實力，准備我們自己，到了相當的時機，開始戰鬥的力量，同時使人家漸漸感覺到我們不是一個全無實力的國家。我們目前的問題不是要聯那國，而是怎樣在最短的期間內建設相當的實力。有了相當的實力，我們自有外交可言；沒有相當的實力後盾，我們的外交只是如拿破崙所説：“為便略者要脅，為被侵略者乞和的機關”而已。近來頗有人以為假使某某人出任外交，我們就大有聯俄或聯日的希望了。這種腦筋和蔣先生被扣在西安的時候，有許多受了麻醉的青年竟以為只要解决了蔣介石，我們立刻就能抗敵了，是同樣的幼稚，簡單。</p>
<p>既然認定了我們的出路，我們就要想，從現在到正面衝突的那一天，我們要怎樣才能生存着；不但生存着，同时還要准備，建設。我們為生存，為收復失地，才主張抗戰，不是為一時的意氣所激動，不顧一切地要和敵人拚一下。所謂“焦土抗戰”的口號只可以用來表示我們准備抗戰的决心，不能作為一種主張，更不成為一種辦法。我們雖不求必勝，但至少也應當避免全國化為焦士的結局。我們言戰，當然是指一種大規模的現代戰爭，全國的動員，不是巷戰，肉搏，接觸而已。假使環境容許我們，我們希望至少能準備到可以繼續作戰半年的能力。但是，事實上敵人和我們自己內部容不容我們做到這個程度，是一個需要準備應付的問題。換句話説，我們一方面要有建設與凖備的自由，一方面還要時時刻刻在應付敵人逐步的分化，搗亂，煽惑，以及其他一切軟性的侵略手段。敵人是要不勞而獲，因為他巳喫着了甜頭。他的最經濟的侵略方法就是擾亂我們的步驟，激動我們，利用我們的窮和我們的國家觀念的缺乏，使我們內部頓起暴動或恐慌，好給他藉口侵佔的機會。若我們不給他任何這種機會，他是否願意來取別的具有犧牲絛件的辦法，在許多人看來是沒有必然性的。我們相信，從現在到雙方都不惜正面衝突的時候，還盾一個彼此和緩的時期。和緩當然是此較的名詞，事實上是敵人施行軟性侵略，而我們忍痛應付的時期、</p>
<p>但是沒有計劃的忍痛只是奴才的本領。為應付這過渡時期的局面，我們希望政府趕快决定一個全盤應付目前的辦法。與其局部地逐漸特殊化，莫如預先想想：那些地方可以暫時放棄的，那些地方我們絕對不能退讓的；我們最低的生命綫在那裏，最高的忍讓點在那裹。正因我們巳認清了方向，認定了目標，所以我們才甘願忍受目前的小節。忍當然是不得已的辦法，在個人感覺上是恥辱的，但是為渡過目前，我們只有這一條路。有人也許要問：我們忍到那一天為止呢？這是不能有答覆的。未來的事實我們固然不知，就是現在我們的實力我們也無從知道。任何國家的軍事秘密是不能公開報告給它國民知道的。目前我們做老百姓的只可以完全信任政府，同時一個不建築在民意磐石上的政府也是不能持久的。</p>

<p>軍部政黨不願正面衝突　結誠藏相説明健全政策</p>
<p>［東京］第七十議會、自從開幕時、軍部與政黨之時局觀不同、醞釀解散議會之空氣、然經五日討論結果、此種空氣漸形消滅、即政黨最初對於林內閣消極的表示不滿意、而在議會質問中、迭次表示其一部意見、然掌握解散議會關鍵之軍部、覺悟雖出於斷然態度、然徒使政界混亂、不能望政黨認識時局、於是似决定意見、先使預算案與其關係法案通過議會、然後實行第二步之革新運動、又政府亦力謀議會之圓滿結束、故此等情勢、與政黨之無勇氣、巳使兩省正面衝突之危機離去、因此今後議會審議預算案增稅案等、决無緊張態度、不過時有政黨之小攻擊、如斯一路向閉幕進行、議會可望圓滿定緒、</p>

<p>勝正憲問、擴充生産力之具體的方策如何、發動金融機關之方針如柯、對於國際經濟主義之所見如何、</p>

<p>勝正憲問、結城藏相將放棄健全財政主義、而專依公債增發主義乎、</p>
<p>結城藏相答、余固堅决主張健全財政者、換言之、即排擊無論借欵若干、亦無不可之政策之意、然照今日之狀況、因國防費其他關係、亦不得不承認增發公債為不得已之舉、公債市價在發行價格以上時、則消化公債固可不必憂慮、然若低至發行價格以下、則消化即發生障礙、故不得不謀振與產業、</p>
<p>以填補國防費、其他之經費、</p>
<p>勝正憲問、陸海軍兩省之中止使用額、何以不分別詳細明示、</p>
<p>梅津陸軍次官答、陸軍方面緊縮之後、繼以緊縮之結果，可謂節約巳極、惟欲一一説明之內容、則時間的技術的、均感困雖、</p>

<p>結城藏相答、最近之將來、日貨之出口不致减少、故須先謀振與國內產案、庶能增加國民所得公債消化力及出口貿易之振興、然後徐徐謀物資供結之豐富、此乃余之根本觀念、輸出統制稅法、仍與余之觀念矛盾、此二法律非僅以課出口貨稅為目的者、世界努力防遏日貨、擬打開之、故設定此法案、欲以實行此法律而得之財源、謀日本出口貿易全體之圓滑發展、</p>
<p>伍堂商相答、來年度鐵之需要佔計鋼鐵為五十萬噸、銑鐵為三十七萬噸，然依生產設備之念速增加、叮增產五十五萬噸、又徒外國、如美法等、可輸入十五萬噸、然大體擬不由外國輸入高價之鐵、而力謀在國內增加產額燃料問題、近擬草成具體之案、</p>

<p>繼由民政黨之櫻非兵五郎對於滿蘇國境問題之現狀、提出質問、</p>
<p>林首相答、以此事日蘇兩國意見大體一致、其餘尚有兩三件、目下正花交涉繼由外次堀內與伍堂商相答辯後、櫻井對於中日外交質問稱、迄今觀察日華外交之經過、無論若何、不得謂為外交之成功、請問對於日華兩國之國民接觸與經濟提携之設施上、有無缺陷、</p>
<p>林外相答、在日華提携上之各種施設、固不能認為完善、現擬再加以具體研究、</p>
<p>櫻井問、在過去一年間、中國毫無任何理由、而慘殺日僑此種事件之交涉經過果若何、</p>
<p>堀內外務次官答、自去年三月以來、繼續辦理交涉、理已陸續得到解决、但尚有兩三件、未經解决者櫻井問、對於廣田內閣之對華三原則、作何見解、林外相答、余認為在原則上、至為正當、但在實行上、尚不無若干異議也、櫻井問、日華外交之最大障碍、當在兩國國民之感情與誤會、中國稱日本為侵略主義者、但余認為兩國原非向共存共榮方面進行不可、試間從文化經濟兩方面、尚有積極進行之方策否、</p>
<p>林首相答、若中國果以日本為侵略主義者、實為遺憾、至於兩國之親善、余之意見，與櫻井君完全相同、</p>
<p>櫻井復對於現內閣之南進政策方針若何、加以質问、</p>
<p>林陸相答以對於移民及原料問題之解决、不受偏重大陸、當充分考慮南進之方策云、午後六時三十五分散會、（二十日同盟電）</p>

<p>來件</p>
<h3>統一救國的眞詮柳湜</h3>
<p>— 柳湜</p>
<p>除對破壞統一的野心家及漢奸，我們要用武力消滅他們以外，我們主張國內各社會羣團的力量集中起來，結成足族陣線，以對當前的民族敵人。這裏我們要求大家放棄昔日的恩怨，平心靜氣的携手言歡，這裏我們高呼民族的存亡重於一切，重於個人人或羣團。因此中國當前要求的是有抵抗敵人侵略的統一的國家，領導民族救亡的民族領袖，我們反對中國政治上再有對立，反對擴大中國社會內部的對立。</p>
<p>因此，中國今日不能有所謂“人民陣綫”。法國西班牙今日的反法西斯的人民陣綫，不能適用於中國，因為法國西班牙反法西斯的人民陣綫，晃法國·西班牙國內對立形成的陣綫，法西斯的統治在資本主義先進的國家，有毀减人民的生命和財產的危機，所以法國，西班牙的人民要起而反對。而中國却不然，中國今日的社會，並沒有這一危機的基礎，中國今日當前的生死問題不是國內的法西斯統治的危機，而是民族敵人的侵略，民族陷於危亡，這一危機不僅是中國下層的人民受到侵害，就是中國的民族資本地主，甚至金融資本都受到危害，中國目前不獨無法西斯統治的危機，連法西斯的統洽也建立不起來，民族敵入是不尤許中國有獨立政權存在的。因此，如果今日有人妄倡“人民陣綫”，機械的模倣法西，我也眞要步駱美奐先生的驥尾，大呼打倒中國“人民陣綫”了。</p>
<p>這樣説來，那不是我和駱先生的意見已是一致了麽？</p>
<p>不！駱先生他反對人民降綫雖是對的，但他把民族陣綫和人民陣綫誤解為一個東西把這二者的差別混同了啊！這一錯眞是錯到外婆家裹去了。　　　我沒有機會像駱先生一樣談到第三國際的議决案和“共匪文件”，我不知道他們到底是用什麽眼光看中國的現實，但我在長江先生的“動盪中之西北大局”（載二月二十五日上海大公報）一文中，却發覺與駱先生所説的並不相同。雖然到底誰的材料正確，我們無法證實，但把駱先生與長江先生的話對照起來，顯然是成了一個矛盾。道是很有趣味的。自然，道一個矛盾我沒有多加注意的必要，因為我既不是共黨，我無代為辯護的必要，不過，就我個人設想，如果第三國際，及中國共產黨在今日還反對中國統一救國，要拏“人民陣綫”去分散國力那他們已走到了絕路，已與中國人民背離，他們是遲早要滅亡的。所以我個人的感覺，長江先生在“動盪中之西北大局”專所提到的“現在共産黨之轉變”的話，倒比較近乎情理。</p>
<p>我是一個無政黨派別的人，但我也是一個“眞正愛國的中國人”，我有救國的要求，因此我也有救國主張。幾年來希望和平統一救中國之心，亦與黨國內諸前進輩相同。講到關于救亡大計，我僅僅不過在雜誌上寫了幾篇文章，大致都收在駱先生所引用的“救亡的基本認識”一書裏，我寫那些文章的時候，正是許多人討論聯合戰綫很熱鬧的時候，聯合戰綫幾個字，已明明白白解釋是全民族力量的團結，不是人民陣綫，其實所謂民族聯合陣綫就不過是統一救國更明白的説法，內容並沒有兩樣。我説“一種聯合陣綫並不是截長補短，消滅內部一切的矛盾而是一面聯合，一面鬥爭……”並不是主張一種陰謀，陽奉陰達，而是要求各種社會力量在統一的前提下充分各自的發揮救國的力量，統一國力，並不能幻想作各種社會羣團的力量一天就完全變為相等，我曾經開玩笑的説過，這裹有長子，也有矮子，我們要使長子負擔起長子的任務，矮子也要有事做，各發揮自己的所能。統一救國是不放過民族內一分力量，都要把它動員起來·在這統一過程中，因為社會努力的不齊一，認識的不齊一，對于實際的，救國的行動，策略，在意見上不能不生出各自的小異。一個實際政治家如駱先生更不應否認這事實。那末，在事實上，我們就不能否認不同的社會勢力間，沒有相對的矛盾存在的事實，在實際的行動上還有爭辯，有鬥爭，但這是有一定的限度的，就是鬥爭不能有妨害我們的聯合。現在目站在國民黨的立塲説，我這話也説得過去，今日中國社會勢力的無疑的是國民黨，在眞正全國統一的時候，國民黨在每一個實際政治行動中，自然仍有自己的政見，對於不同的政派及個人，所提出的主張，不見得樣樣都同，那末，在討論每一實際問題中，一定不免有爭議，那就是一種鬥爭，國民黨員一定要在統一的前提下爭取自己政治主張的實現，不然就失了國民黨員的職責，這是非常容易了解的事，所以我又説“一般誤解聯合陣綫的人，以爲我們既然共同站在一起了，我們朋友間用不着再有什麽鬥爭的一，這完全是就事實説，我不敢把統一看得太美觀，太抽象，弄得神秘起來，反妨害了實現統一的行動。</p>

<h3>上海大戯院昨被搗毀</h3>
<p>因開映“阿比西尼亞”影片　昨被義水兵義僑等所搗毀</p>
<p>中央社云、北四川路虬江路口上海大戲院、為映演蘇聯電影新聞工廠山品亞洲影片公司經理之“阿比西尼亞影片、被義大利在滬水兵及僑民所搗毀、所蒙損失、現已由各方進行交涉中、兹誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>重送檢查</p>
<p>上海大戲院、位於越界築路地段北四用路虬江路口、第五二三號為蘇聯僑商所辦、時有蘇聯出品影片映演、此次所演之“阿比西尼亞”影片、亦為蘇聯電影新聞工廠出品、該片於去歲到滬、即送經中央電影檢查委員會檢查准許、即運滬、由該院於一月二十一日開映、當時因義大利使館向外交部交涉、請求停止映演、外交部即函請本市政府、令由主管警署禁止映演、該院僅映一天、即告停止、而中央電影檢查委員會、亦令由該院送請重檢、該院遵令再送中電檢會檢查、方於前日通過發還、</p>
<p>准許開映</p>
<p>該院將該片送請重檢後、乃登報訂於昨日重映、北四川路警察所所長陳澤寬見報後、因恐發生事端、且未奉正式書面命令、故仍令該院禁映、該院以業奉中央電檢會重檢許可、且巳刊登廣告、勢難中止、陳所長即將此事報告市府俞秘書長、俞氏即向外交部請示、同時該院亦向中央電檢會請求轉請外交部轉電本市市政府撤銷禁令、中央電檢會以該片既經重檢、且其內容已無開；罪國之處、應准映演、故即准如所謂、外交部亦即電市府、撤銷禁令、市府即令陳所長、准予映演二天、</p>
<p>發生事端</p>
<p>昨日為該片重演之第一日、計分上午十一時·下午一時·三時·五時一刻·七時一劉·九時一刻·共六塲、前二塲均平安開映、未生事端、至第三塲時、即有義國身穿制服之水兵數十名、（帽上有Lepanto字樣）及僑民數十人、在樓廰及芷廰歡映、初不料即將發生事端、</p>
<p>肇事經過</p>
<p>當新聞片映演甫畢、正片開始映演至阿此西尼亞人民宣誓參加入軍隊抗敵時、全塲觀衆、大起鼓掌、表示同情、忽有坐於樓廰之義人站起大呼口號、於是旁坐之義國水兵及僑民、均一致起立、向機器間衝進、同時尚有一部分義水兵及僑民、將預藏之木棍亂打、及將阿莫尼亞水瓶、硝酸水瓶·向塲內亂投、於是塲內大為紊亂、同時氬氣滿溢、共臭難聞、但機器房因事前將們緊鎖、且有防禦物堆置門口、一時未易打破、終以人數之多、且間有執武器者、門為破毀、各義水兵蠭擁而入、所有機器全被毀壞、阿此西尼亞全部影片，亦被取去、尚有其他各種影片、藏於機器房者、被硝酸所毀、同時該院電氣技師阿布拉木維區、（蘇俄籍）之左臂、受有重傷、尚有一華技師名馬耀華、亦受有微傷、</p>
<p>被毀損失</p>
<p>院內正在騷動發生時、院外另有義水兵及僑民約百餘人、有類似軍官者率領、亦蠭擁衝入大門、將該院大玻璃窗賣票門電燈廣告牌、各種玻璃像片鏡架，完全毀壞無餘、此時觀衆因內部情形已極紊亂、而外部又來大批人員衝入、故極形惶恐、爭先恐後、奪路奔逃、其狠狽情形、至為慘憐、而內外義國水兵及僑民見目的已達、乃出大門、登預備之汽車而去、</p>
<p>警所報告</p>
<p>當事件未發生時、北四川路警察所派有警長一名、警士三名、在門首駐守、事件騷生後、戲院當局、即電知該所所長陳澤寬、同時駐守於該院之警長，亦即奔返所內報告、陳所長據報後、即率領警士二十餘名、赶至該院、但義國軍民均巳遁去、無法拘捕陳所長除派警士數人駐守該院外、並即回所報告上峯、</p>
<p>呈請交涉</p>
<p>中央社記者事後向該院探詢據該院負責人談，此次搗毀本院，似出於有計劃行動、其中目擊有義國副領事商務參贊及軍官等亦在坐、當騷動發生時、一面將各物盡量毀壞、同時呼口號唱歌、現在所受損失究有多少、尚難估計、但已向蘇俄領事館早報、請中國政府、同向義領館嚴重交涉、</p>
<p>陳澤寬談</p>
<p>復據北四川路警察所所長陳澤寬語中央社記者，此次登生不幸事件、本人職責所在、事前雖審愼處理、後以見其較有刺激性者、已完全刪除、即有義人前往、料或不致發生事故、豈知出人意料、本人得報後、即趕往出事地點、雖近在咫尺、而到達時、所有暴動者、已完全退去、不然、當將拘捕法辦、現將經過情形、報告上峯、聽候處理、</p>

<h3>統一與和平（續）</h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>滿清什麽時代起。不安呢？我們知這在乾隆年間已經醞釀着農民暴動，如白蓮馱之流都是的。乾隆下江南彷彿是滿清的盛世，而不知他的鼓兆敗徵，已經逐漸顯出來了。到了辛亥革命爆發，滿清的督撫和地方的紳士往往一變而為革命軍政府的都督。銅山東傾，浴鐘西應滿清實際上就在這種情形下滅亡了。所以當時眞由革命軍所克服的省份並不多，而多半是文武官吏或紳士依附過來的。就拿江蘇省來説，程德全就是一個顯著的例子。尤其是北方的袁世凱，因爲他自己有野心，所以連同他的部下都由段祺瑞統率着電請滿清遜位。難道他們那時也懂得三民主義嗎？不是的，是歷史的循環到了，那時的中央政府（清廷）到了崩潰的時期了。幸而中華民國的臨時政府成立，自己宣佈獨立的省份都服從臨時政府，表而上波有分裂。後來袁世凱遷都北京，結果還是舊勢力戰勝新勢力。雖然舊勢力戰勝，但是已經走到中央政府崩潰的時期，他要想憑藉了軍閥的力量來統一是不可能的。結果袁氏失敗以後，乃演變成為軍閥割據，而督軍團於是乎出現。什麽是督軍團？督軍團就是割據勢力的大聯合。不但中央不能指揮他，他反而可以指揮中央，甚至於張動率兵到北京去復辟。到了直皖之戰，直奉之戰，齊盧之戰等等，形成了軍閥割據的最高峯。幸而孫中山先生明定了中華民國的國體，沒有皇帝，這般軍閥割據稱雄，無論如何不敢公然稱王，否則馮國璋是王，張動也地王，張作霖也是王，吳佩孚也是王，可以弄成十七八個國家，更將不堪設想！</p>
<p>這神軍閣割據，不尊奉中央統一的情况，並不始於民國初年，其遠因早在清末種下了。但看甲午中日之役，在戰事未發時，李鴻章就説，“今內而部臣，外而疆吏，均未能通刀合作，”“各省督撫不能同心合意，畛域之見梗於中，斯牽製之情形於外。”到了戰端已啟，海軍衙門想把南洋閩洋各艦，和北祥艦隊組成一軍、南洋説，“吳淞為江海要衙，兵艦斷難抽調，”閩洋説，“馬江之瘡挗未復，臺防况復戒嚴？”以這種不統一的割據局面，難怪日本人説甲午之後，日本只和李鴻章一人打仗。我們明白了中國近百年來的歷吏，明白了歷史的循環，那麽民國成立後二十年來的軍閥割據，其種因實在是很遠的了。但是割據之後，永遠聽他割據下去嗎？假使永遠割據下去，中國將不啻成為十七八國家。要他確確實實造成一個國家，只有完成統一這一條大路。孟子所謂“天下惡乎定？定於一”惟其定於一，乃能和平。有元末的羣雄割據，必有朱元璋的統一，有了朱元璋的統一，才有明朝開國的和平：有了隨末的羣雄割據，必有李世民的統一，有了李世民的統一，才有唐朝開國的和平。這是一定的道理。我們經過二十年的羣奉勸據，內部戰亂，飽受痛苦，當然希望和平，而達到和平的方法只有統一。這是歷史必然的演變，不論何黨何派都不能否認需要和平，尤其需要統一的。</p>
<p>怎樣求得和平呢？當然要消滅割據的勢力。怎樣消滅割據的勢力呢？我的回答就是統一。統一的反面是割據割據的結果是戰亂。所以惟有擁護統一的力量，才可以消滅一切割據的勢力，而達到眞正的和平。這是我們的信念。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>或許有人説要求和平不一定靠統一，“聯全”也可以求和平。他們似乎把聯合和‘統一’看成一樣，彷彿英United文一個字，譯聯合固可，譯統一也未始不可。但又似乎看成兩樣，所以他們有時説“以聯合求統一。”其實聯合與統一是陽貨貌似孔子，很有分別。什麽分別呢？聯合之前，一定有許多單位，起碼有兩個以上的單位，才把他們聯起來合起來，但是無論怎樣聯合，內部的單位仍在存在：這呌做聯合。所謂統一，是把原有的單位經過統一運動之後融化為一個整個的單位，原有的單位完全分不出來，這才是統一。即孟子所謂定於一。所以聯合與統一，貌似神非，實在不是一件事。聯合的出發點是承認許多單位，永不消滅；統一的出發點，祗有一個單位。試一翻閱中國的歷史，歷代統後的和平，是許多單位並存着聯合起來成功的呢？運是統一成為一個單位而售到的？中國所以能綿列到現在，成為最古最長久的國家，就是山於“一個單位”的精神在那裏誹擊。假使聯合可以求得和平，那麽我們不要忘記兩件事：第一件是民國十年左右所提倡的聯省自治。當時想把一省一省的巨頭聯合起來，承廖他們各省去自治，再行聯合，但是得到和平了嗎？結果，失散了。第二件是民國五六年間的督軍團。督軍團的份子都是頂頂有名軍權財權在握的人物，他們所組織的團體還不算是聯合嗎？但是結果仍然不能和平。爲什麽？因爲聯省自治與督軍團都是割據的、反統一的；反統一，就是反和平，所以結果一定不能和平，反而延長不和平的局面。所以“聯合”這個名詞表面上好聽好看，實際上等於有糖衣的毒藥。我們要求眞正的和平，祇有眞正的統一，這種有糖衣的毒藥——就是聯合——决不能得到眞正和平。今天大家的利害相同，勉強聯合，明大利害衝突，馬上翻臉打仗。這種翻雲覆雨的聯合，我們國民需要嗎？我們四萬萬五干萬的老白姓沒有什麽各樹單位，沒有人設是我山東人，山東帮應該成一軍位打江蘇幫，我是江蘇人，江蘇幫應該成一單位打浙江幫；也沒有人説我們江浙人應該聯合起來打廣東幫，兩廣聯合起來打兩湖幫。根本我們不需要一個一個的獨立單位，這些獨立的單位是軍閥們所想要把持的。這個軍閥把持這個單位，作自己的系統，自己的力量；那個軍閥把持那個單位，作自己的系統，自已的力量。試問道不是分裂割據是什麽？這種分裂割據的局面，呌我們先承認他，再勉強的聯合起來，我們能承認嗎？還有，他們口口聲聲説，各黨各派聯台，實實在在是要我們承認共産黨的所謂“紅軍”系統所謂“蘇維埃”政槽，承認他是一個獨立單位，我們能容忍嗎？我們常常的國民，為什麽不拿出主人翁的態度，否認他們的一切小單位呢？我們祗要中華民族中華民國整個的單位，有了這個惟一單位，就可以維擊中國整個的統一，保障國家長久的和平。至於以聯合求和平，或以聯台求統一，郡無屍的是一種騙人的説法。</p>

<p>本月期紗反有加碼</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、除本月份外　各月一律下落、且跌風劇烈、同業中以倉庫中空方解進之紗、至昨晚止、已達二萬零七包之譜、因此看小心思濃厚、但印商二月期之多額、非但不了結、反來購進、查本月份僅剩星期一一天交易、散户鑒於市塲堅昂、祇得扒補、遠月被其帶起、結果各月比上日收盤價跌六·八角、惟本月勿動、午後開盤、市氣稍緊、市塲傳言某方紗廠有工潮發生、多方仍不放鬆、三品紗回好二·三元、人氣仍挺、迨至三收盤、據云二月期又拖進一千餘包、市價愈堅、現紗交易仍達二千包外、市盤緩歩上進、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲九角至一元、查賣出吉豐八百是、同孚六百包、合興一千三百包、元一七百五十包、大昌成一千六百五十包、長豐一千一百五十包、恊成五百五十包、福康一千一百包、大豐四百包、買進大孚一千零五十包、大豐五百五十包、錦昌　千四百包、明德一千五百包、泰興八百五十包、長餘五百五十包、恒德六百五十包、裕大一千零五十包、賡豐一千一百五十包、元一五百五十包、兹將一日間最高低、及收盤價列左、</p>
<p>現紗銷路二千餘包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各帮、買去統計　千零四十七包、售價與上日相仿、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>期棉終覺不支</p>
<p>內地存棉豐厚　廠需亦見呆滯</p>
<p>棉市趨疲、跌風又熾、人氣鬆懈、市塲傳言、某方紗廠稍有發生工潮、而內地存棉尚雄厚、故同業傾同抛賣、同時現棉廠需轉趨沉悶、賣方更形活動、市盤愈挫、</p>
<p>標花跌三角餘</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美棉印棉一意下降、測其氣勢、殊覺萎靡、人心更形不振、且多數因內地存棉雄厚、尚未運出、傾向賣出、故市情更難上升、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一角半至二·三角、午後開盤、市價甚疲、因一小部份紗廠有工潮之説、同時現棉廠需停滯、形勢尤弱、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌五分至一·二角、查賣出裕大一千六百担、吉豐一千二百担、振大一千担、合興二千二百担、豐泰二千担、元一一千五百担、潤康一千八百担、長和三千六百担、泰興一千八百担、興昌一千四百担、福康一千七百擔、同和一千六百担、源興昌二千五百担買進愼昌二千五百擔、望泰興四千九百擔、益康一千四百擔、大孚二千四百擔、合興一千二百擔、元一　千一百擔、恒昌　千二百擔、新昶一千四百擔、通記一千擔、兹將一日間最高低及收盤價列後、</p>
<p>現棉來源全無</p>
<p>現棉消費寂寞、廠需呆頓、來源全無、</p>
<p>一月底華英日存紗統計</p>
<p>本埠某棉業機關調查、本年一月份、上海華英日各廠存紗數量、日廠紗爲一千七百六十三包、華英紗爲二萬六千四百三十六包、合計存量爲二萬八千一百九十九包、比上年歳暮存量之一萬六千六百三十七包、激增一萬一千五百六十二包、查紗布交易所倉庫之存紗在上年底、僅七千九百四十包、至一月底、存量增加至一萬六千五百六十包、再調查至昨日止、已達　萬○七百包、兹將存紗支别及額量如下、（單包位）、</p>
<p>美棉多頭移往遠月</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月跌二磅音至漲二磅音、塲內交易、因下星期二將發表交割通知、三月期多頭大半了結及移往遠月、同業及現貨商雖努力買進、但賣户更加旺盛、至其他月份、則頗形淸淡、戰時物料之漲價、未受注意、收盤時、棉農略有套賣、市勢平穩、計現貨跌一磅音、期貨跌三磅音、英棉現貨跌一點、期貨漲一點、印棉初因空户大批賣出及多頭了結而跌、後因出口商及本地廠家買進而回、計平果爾漲○·二五羅比、奥姆辣跌○·五至○·七五羅比、白羅溪跌一·二五至一·五羅比、原電錄左、（十九日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百十九羅比半、奥姆辣爲二百○二羅比半、平果爾爲一百七十八羅比二五、均跌○·二五羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗花昨見回漲</p>

<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>當令棉布銷塲頗暢</p>
<p>昨棉布以三品及標紗俱見回挺、青島疋頭拍價仍然堅定、棉布走勢逐漸現進展之勢、人心因之良好、昨天津帮續辦花鳥等牌本月份細布二百餘包、鎭江帮亦來躉批添辦雙龍珠等牌細布二百數十包、本街色布號感於現貨細布缺乏、過件色布存貨不厚、競欲備辦坯布、以應客需、故細布市銷最爲活潑、昨成交東貨及本廠貨五六百包、以本月份派貨居多、因急於應用、閩粤長江各埠生意、逐歩增盛、逢價格相巧之貨頗多躉批購去、惟以時令及將近動銷之貨爲限、冬令及新春當銷之貨、以急待掃除底貨、添辦寥落、白貨粗布以軍裝及內地帮粤帮長江帮一致需貨、英商公益廠工潮遲延不决供給缺乏、市勢殊堅云、</p>
<p>國貨嗶嘰暢銷</p>
<p>國貨元藏素色嗶嘰、現頗暢銷、本街呢絨同業齊有經售因舶來品到存有限、加之華人制服春季齊多購用、致市銷日增、其中尤以章華九一八及達隆一二八牌子銷路更暢、售盤又漲五分、如章華九一八售三元○五分、達隆一二八爲三元云、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>期粉市面又見回昂</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈一致回挺之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥近期不動、遠小一角六分半、坎拿大好四八分不等、利物浦爲一便士零、故開價後、各月份人心、似稍見穩、本月份距月底交割、已祇數日（交易所定拍至二十四日爲止）不過多空籌碼、已見减少、故初雖見平、繼即回振、三月份因出户不多、業外吸收不少、市遂挺住、四月份則外行收買更暢、跳度較鋭、七月份則多頭反脱、漲度見弱、目下市塲情形、因業外交易、盛於客帮、故漲落靡常、難以把握、惟以事實而言、須以實銷之暢否爲定云、</p>
<p>現麥雖貪尚乏成交</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、各月份市面均呈穩挺之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小一角零、坎拿大好四八分、利物浦好一便士零、當開價時、以洋麥比較微好、且本月份之標準、因日來廠方對現麥尚貪、故標凖收回、而脱現貨、業中人心、不免轉挺、二三四月份開價即好六七分、後呈盤旋、六七月份新麥、因出户較稀、遠期粉市仍俏、故續好二三分、現麥貨主喊高、致未成交、</p>
<p>客秈本街銷路尚旺</p>
<p>昨日客秈本銷尚旺、客化依然呆滯、汕頭帮稍爲點綴、久乏暢胃、且邇日到頭日旺、每日到埠萬餘二萬許不等、市面一時難望好轉、惟昨日本化甚活、貨主亦不急脱、市面始得暫定、全日開出湘米五百六十五包、贛米六千八百五十包、多數爲本街辦去、</p>
<p>河米行市稍稍回起</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到三十餘號、貨約六千三四百石、內薄稻二十餘號、本街銷塲仍屬有限、包胃依然懈淡、祇青島帮辦薄稻四五百包、尚幸天時陰雨、人心轉堅、故薄稻行情轉呈定局、厚粳則以到稀扳起角許、後市趨勢、須視包胃、是否暢達爲轉移、杜洋及陰元均無榮辱、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到貨寥寥、約有十六七號、晨刻因天雨不止、賣買雙方上市無幾、致各貨交易有限、市形挺立、後市因見西安帮包胃動辦、客性轉堅、</p>
<p>黄荳去路尚佳</p>
<p>—芝蔴見軟化—</p>
<p>黄荳　昨日黄荳市况、先承大連市升而趨緊、後因大連市轉跌而定、全日計開四平街豆十七車、蚌埠豆八車、臨淮關豆一車、范家屯豆一車、去路爲榨油廠及內地車坊、此外本街汕頭等辦去丁家州豆二百五十包、漢口乍豆二千包、九江遲豆二百包、九江冬豆二百七十包、平湖杜豆三百包、</p>
<p>芝蔴　昨洋莊芝蔴市勢尚屬軟化、因國外市態不良、洋行辦胃觀望、現貨毛蔴平平、</p>
<p>油豆餅遠期穩定</p>
<p>昨日連市電訊轉好、期貨油豆餅市均見回定、惟現豆邇日實銷甚滯、存底充足、近期標豆難以上展、收市祗好二分、遠期有囤户問訊、回好四五分、餅油實銷尚可、行號抛勢已緩、隨引起捕空與外行問津、各月份一致回站、期油漲一角半至二角半不等、標餅漲一分半、惟大連市面尚未走入軌道、後市殊難預料也、</p>

<h3>懶與勤</h3>
<p>— 婉文</p>
<p>懶與勤，我們一看見這題目，自然而然對於懶感覺到是不良的習慣。勤是恰得其反，如果問小朋友們歡喜做懶的孩子或勤的孩子，我相信你們一定不約而同的回答歡喜做勤的孩子，可是在我們日常生活中可以瞧到懶的人比勤的人多，雖然他們知道懶是不良的習慣，雖然懶的人也在工作，不過是敷衍罷了，這種情形在學校生活中，也能尋見，有些同學懶得每天課本也不預備，到學期結束時没有升級，這便是懶的結果。當然也有别的原因。</p>
<p>一個懶惰的孩子，要改成勤，這不過是一時的覺悟，不久以後仍恢復舊性，除非他有决心才能成功勤的孩子，可是很難的，一個勤的孩子要變成懶，那是非常容易，只要你不照以前那樣做，可以立刻變成一個懶的孩子，這是甚麽緣故呢？因爲懶是太舒適太安閒了，人的天性愛好享樂的，勤是太勞苦太吃力了，人當然不歡喜這些。</p>
<p>怎樣分别懶和勤的利弊呢？懶的人表面就是萎靡不振，對於各種事，都是不高興的態度，勤的人不是這樣的，他非但可以感到工作時的趣味，還可得到工作後結果的快活。</p>
<p>所以我希望小朋友們！以前是懶的孩子，那麽現在决心地改爲勤的孩子，不貪圖舒適安閒。以前是勤的孩子，現在應該更勤，不要被舒適安閒所引誘，永遠做個勤的孩子。</p>
<h3>關於韓信的受辱胯下</h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>關於韓信受辱胯下的那一個故事，小朋友們大概都能知道了吧。就是韓信在童年的時候，他常常歡喜帶了寳劍到外面去，態度是很英雄的。不料一位無賴見了，很不服氣，便對他説道：你有本領的就拿寳劍來刺我，否則，你得打從我的胯下攢過。韓信没有辦法，只得打從那無賴的胯下攢過，於是一市的人都譁笑了。但到後來，關於韓信受辱胯下的故事，反傳爲歷史的美談，並且都讚美他，説他能够忍耐。</p>
<p>其實，我們對於這個故事的應該着重的地方，不在於他的忍耐，而在於他的奮勉，他的忍耐，是一時的無恥，他的奮勉，是長期的知恥。所以，他的無恥，我們是不當學的，就是必不得已而暫時無恥的忍耐一下，也應緊接那個知恥而從事於長期的奮勉。譬如韓信當時只是無恥，而不知恥，只作暫時忍耐而不作長期奮勉，他定不僅受這一次的胯下之辱而已，且將終身的受人胯下之辱，只爲他能知恥，他能長期奮勉，所以終於湔雪了他這一次的恥辱，並且還建樹了偉大的勳業。</p>
<p>現在，我們處在這樣的環境與地位，或許也有像韓信般受辱胯下的暫時忍耐的必要，但我們學了韓信的一時的無恥，還須更學韓信的長期的知恥，好把我們奮勉的結果，湔雪這忍耐的恥辱。這是小朋友在聽到或講到這個故事應該特别注意的。</p>
<h3>記小明星胡蓉蓉</h3>
<p>— 曼子</p>
<p>中國影壇上的小明星很少，在上海，只有陳娟娟和胡蓉蓉，表現的技術最好，蓉蓉年紀比娟娟小，更覺得難能可貴。她今年祇七歳，在静安小學讀書，是前期小學二年級級長，去年的學業成績，爲全校第一，因此得到奬學金，是免去一年的學費，一千多個小弟弟小妹妹，都給她壓倒，可知她的智慧和努力，於將來是極有希望的。</p>
<p>她第一個影片的嘗試，是『父母子女』，雖然文化影片公司已成歷史上的名詞，而她留在幾千萬觀衆的美妙的印象，永遠地存在。到了明星公司，在『永遠的微笑』裏，先露了一點頭角，最近就主演了『壓歳錢』。在『壓歳錢』裏，最動人的有兩種表演，一是木偶兵的劍舞；一是喫年夜飯後的踢躂舞。</p>
<p>她的舞，是請外國教師指導的，好在她還有一位家庭教師，她的嫂子龔秋霞女士，也是擅長歌舞的，足够帮助她平時的温習的觀摩了。</p>
<p>秋霞女士説：『這回的攝製壓歳錢，是嚴冬，並且在子夜，天氣這們冷，要她穿着單薄的舞衣，已凍得她牙齒捉對兒相打，她忍耐着，體會了劇情，聽着導演的指揮，唱歌跳舞，一點没有比平時在家裏練習减色，這們乳臭未乾的小姑娘，能够如此盡心力於藝術，連我也佩服她的。所以在完成以後，没有一個不向她道賀，而導演還給她天才的榮譽呢。』</p>
<p>天才，固然是可以使一個人速於成就，但是學力也是不可少的肥料。我很硯望她的保護人，注意到這一點，不要使一個極有希望的明星終止於此。</p>
<h3>吉兒給先生的一封信</h3>
<p>— 士鵬</p>
<p>—報告假期中的生活</p>
<p>先生：</p>
<p>别離了你，到現在已是第十天了。我這十天來的生活狀况，也許你要急於知道的吧！</p>
<p>本來，我在寒假內的工作計劃，除了温習我自己功課外，餘下的時間，便依照你所囑咐我們的：「多做些有益於人的事業」。爲了這句話，曾經幾次三番地，在我腦海裏盤旋；假使一個人單獨的去做，深恐會感覺到寂寞，與難免不發生錯誤的痛苦。於是在放假後的第二日，我便同明生去商量，他很贊同我的主張—兩人合力的去做。當時我們擬定了兩項工作，在每個以後的下午去做。那兩項工作呢？第一，每天教那一般工人讀一課書；第二，把當日國家的大事報告給他們聽。這兩項工作，自實行以來，我們都是輪流的去做。最值得告訴你的一件事，就是我們每次到他們家裏去，他們非但不討厭我們，反而很高興的歡迎我們呢！這個原因大概是每次我們去時，都没有妨礙他們的工作吧！我想。</p>
<p>以後我們在街上遇到了，都很親熱的招呼着。記得在初到他們家裏的那幾天，他們常把生活怎樣困苦的情形告訴我們，後來也不再對我們談起了。最近的陝西事變，他們也都切齒痛恨這般喪心病狂者，作引狼入室的勾當。先生，寫得不少了，再談吧！祝你</p>
<p>快樂</p>
<p>你的學生吉兒上廿日</p>

<h3>雪晨</h3>
<p>— 知本小學五年級生吳品賢</p>
<p>有一天早晨，我睡得很熟的時候，忽聽得時辰鐘敲了六下，我忙穿起衣裳，到後園裏去散歩。見地而上，以及枯枝上，蓋着一層雪。那些無抵抗精神的花草，都已枯死。只有那園東一帶的梅花，它竟能振作精神，抵抗霜雪，呈其幽静之姿，真值得欽佩啊！我在花旁徘徊數轉，覺得我國北部綏遠省，現在僞匪侵擾，一班忠勇的將士，正在寒冷的冰雪中，不屈不撓，和敵人抗戰，其精神真似梅花。</p>
<h3>在没有鐘錶的時候用什麽來算的時間的？</h3>
<p>— 哉祥</p>
<p>我們到一處野外去旅行的時候，如果没有帶錶，那時候我們還能知道時間嗎？或許有幾個經騐豐富的小朋友，看到人影子的長短，會定出一個大概的時間來，但是遇到了陰天，那就没有辦法了。</p>
<p>我們再追想到古時候，没有鐘錶這樣東西，他們在怎樣計算時間？用什麽東西在計算時間呢？這是個很有趣而值得討論的問題：</p>
<p>在最初的時候，人們計時没有什麽一時兩時的，只是『一日』，意思就是日頭從東昇起，到西方下山看了一次的日頭。</p>
<p>後來因爲業務多起來了。以一日計時覺得太簡單了，於是就有人想出幾種比較進歩的計時方法來。</p>
<p>（一）更燭　這是在夜間用的一種計時器（見圖一），就是用一枝特種的蠟燭，燭上刻有五個格子，一格可燃一更的時光，所以它叫做更燭；當此燭完全燃去的時候，正是五更天將亮了，於是人們就在這時候起來工作了。</p>
<p>（二）銅壺滴漏　這種計時器，形狀有多種，但是大概的形狀總是相彷彿的（見圖二）：用一個梯形的架子，置了五個漏水的斗，自頂上漏至下斗，稱一晝或一夜。這比較「更燭」更進歩了。</p>
<p>以上兩種是我國最通行的，但不止這兩種，如：「竹竿量日影」，「雄雞的報曉」……等等都是的。在外　没有鐘錶之前也使用着這種簡陋的計時器，如：水鐘，沙鐘（與我國滴漏差不多）……等等都是的。</p>
<p>總之無論一件什麽東西的發明之前，總有一個有趣的過程，如：「没有火柴之前他們　樣生火的」？「没有電燈，煤油燈之前，他們在夜間怎樣辦」？……諸如此類，我們只要想一想，就會對人類的生活史，發生研究的興趣了。</p>

<p>但那沙魚們老是纒住了他們，不肯放鬆，又聽得一聲又一聲的慘呼，眼見那海水漸漸地泛出紅色來，可知那些吊在救生船邊的水手們一個又一個，被沙魚們銜去了。最後只剩下了六個人，那大副向船中瞧了一下，停住了撥水的工作，原來他的一條腿也在這當兒被沙魚咬去了，可是他爲的不願驚動那些水手，便咬牙切齒的忍受着苦痛，始終不做出呐喊或呻吟的聲音，因此水手們都不知道發生了什麽一回事，直到後來他的第二條腿又被咬去了，才止不住喊了一聲痛，同時他那抓住船邊的一雙手，也放下了。當下就有二人搶住了他，把他拉到船中去，他躺在那里，痛得打顫，但是一面仍關心着水手們的安全。他喚了一個最年青的水手威爾遜過去，就爲了他最年青的緣故，對他分外的愛護，使他少受危險，在大副的意想之中，這一回惟有他也許可以生還，於是大副鄭重的囑咐他回去時，對海軍大臣説，他們曾到盎太華呷去搜尋海盗，却不幸遇了險，他接下去又説道：『你對海軍大臣説我部下的水手們已盡了他們的責任，在他們是可告無罪的了。此外我還有一個要求，就是求他把梅爾德勒升爲砲手。』</p>
<p>他説完了話，就和水手們逐一握手道别，並且掙扎着説些樂觀的話鼓勵他們；然而這整整的一天，他晒在烈日之下，又斷絶了飲食，早已筋疲力盡，連説話的氣力都没有了。在日落的時候，沙魚們又攻襲上來，水手們一面驚呼，一面忙了手脚，早又將那救生船打翻了。而大副的痛苦也就結束在滔天海浪之中。</p>
<p>這一位勇敢的大副愛德華史密斯，出身於哈姆歇埃地方，是一家中最寵愛而最有希望的兒子，由一位寡居的慈母撫養起來，自入海軍任職以後，很得海軍大臣海士鐵爵士的器重。但瞧他在九死一生的危難之中，仍抱着鎭静的態度，指揮他的部下各盡他們的責任，知有他人而不知有自己，這種偉大的精神，是很足以給青年們做模範的。</p>

<h3>環球航空旅行紀（下）</h3>
<p>— 美國法爾考納博士著特譯</p>
<p>十一月一日下午七時二十二分，飛抵華克島，知道中國飛剪號將由該處飛往馬尼刺，這次僅載客兩人。次晨六時，中國飛剪號啟程向瓜姆島進發。少頃我們接得無綫電報，説因為途中遭遇颶風，已被迫折回華克島。汎美航空公司曾在瓜姆島華克島米特威島建造旅館，館中都設有電燈和私用浴室，旅客住在裹面很舒服，餐品也極精美。十一月二日星期一晨六時十六分，中國飛剪號出發數分鐘後，我們也離開華克島，前往米特威島。這站的飛程，長一一八五哩，而在十一月一日星期日下午四時零五分到達。為什麼飛了一天，反而縮回一天呢？這却因為西徑綫一八○度，是國際日子綫，地球上的日子，由這綫算起，這綫距離米特威島西而很近，倘若在這日子綫正西是星期一日，這綫東面却是星期日，所以我們前後所過的兩天，都是十一月一日星期日。</p>
<p>太平洋商務海電公司在米特威島設立海電站，已有三十三年，共有職員約十八人。該公司曾在島上種了許多松樹，澳洲樹膠樹，木芙蓉樹，和其他樹本的花木，那松樹和樹膠樹已高至五十呎之譜。汎太平洋航空公司現將在該島置職員約十八人，故島上居民總共將有三十五人左右，目前只有一位女性。現任太平洋商務海電公司檀香山分公司監督法磊塞氏和麥克米却爾氏一九○四年在米特威島供职時，曾将驢子兩頭，一牝一牡，運至該島，以供公餘騎行，借此娛樂。幾年之後，他們二位調至附近東島股務，這兩頭驢子，和若干小驢，連同許多食料，都被帶往。他們在島上掘了一口井，供給驢子的飲料，詎知驢子不肯吃井水，牠們用蹄子在離海灘稍遠處的砂中掘了一個潭，吃裏面的黑水。驢子初靠島上樹木的葉兒充飢，不出多時，樹木遭蟲患凋敝，於是二十餘頭驢子，死剩了三頭。</p>
<p>每逢秋季，有大批大海燕從亞留地安羣島飛到米特威島度冬，內分黑白兩種，我們只看見許多黑色的，那白色的須稍遲飛來。每一雙母燕，都在砂中掘一個巢，生一個很大的蛋在巢裹，伏在蛋上，直到雛燕孵出，方才離開。於是雌雄大燕都啣食喂這雛燕，翼護很為謹愼，到了離燕能離巢幾呎遠時，大燕便不喂食。當在島上建造旅館之時，運送材料的汽車曾把許多雛燕移開，而在巢上標明記號，車過之後，再把雛燕放在巢中，以免餓死。</p>
<p>十一月二日晨六時十分，我們由米特威鳥出發，飛行一三零四哩後，而於下午五時十二分飛抵檀香山，降落珠港。這是全程中最有興趣的一段，沿途島嶼綿延，青翠奪目，內有數島，高出海面約二百呎。全程中最可愛的景色，是在飛船中向下面一二哩瞭望，看見飛船的影兒，像一隻大鳥一般，飛在雲裏，四周有一道圓形的美麗之虹繚繞着。十一月十八日正午，我由檀香山出發，十九日晨飛抵阿拉米達，正午復發，下午五時安然在達拉斯降地，完成環繞世界的飛行。乘坐商業飛船飛機作環球航空旅行，我可算得是第一個人。全程共二六○八○哩，除去住在東方五個月的費用不算，共用去旅費美金三千三百五十五元，實飛的日期，共十六天。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>叩頭外交</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>昨據報載，前日日衆院大會，各議員相繼質問政府，而質問之有價值的，便是日本一位老政治家尾崎行雄氏，他對於肅軍及外交，均有直捷痛快的表示，聽者莫不為之動容，其次則為中野正剛之質問演説，竟歷兩小時半之久，在他們質問的詞鋒看來，政閣與軍部方面，顯然暴露着不同的政見，與破壞的裂痕，但是雙方結果的勝敗如何，尚待下回分解。</p>
<p>兹所欲談的，便是中野正剛演説中，有幾句很為新奇的语句，特為表而出之，他説林兼外相之外交，無論對華對英美，均一律行使親善，向四方八面叩頭，可謂叩頭外交，但外交與親善之感情，尚屬另一問題云云。這種話很有些雖解，很有些奇特，一國的政治，天然有一國的國策，一國的外交，天然有一國的方針，故各國的外交慣例，不過抱定其外交宗旨，整齊其外交步驟，去折衝樽俎而已，而日本之外交，則花樣翻新，無奇不有，即據近日所見於新聞紙者而言，有一元外交，有關爭外交，有水鴨外交，現在又有所謂叩頭外交，但是叩頭外交四字，我有些不相信，日本近年以來，耀武揚威，目空一世，其氣燄之盛，世界各國對之，祇有唉聲歎氣，不敢説話，何至欲用叩頭外交，對英美去叩頭外交，猶有可説，何至對中國而亦去叩頭外交，真是豈有此理。</p>
<p>但是既用叩頭外交，自應得到親善的結果，何以他又説外交與親善之感情，尚屬另一問題，則雖叩盡共頭，而亦得不到親善的結果，其理由又在何許？然一面儘管叩頭，而另一面儘管實行其砲火政策，故頭愈叩而感情愈覺其壞也，然我以為中野正剛所謂叩頭外交，並不是對外而害，是對內而發，日本政團與軍部雙方意見日顯差池，接觸日見嚴重，做外相者，真有好呌我左右做人難之概，尊重了甲方的意旨，則與乙方碰壁，尊重了乙方的意旨，則又與甲方碰壁，故尾畸行雄氏之言日，外交政策之不一元化，為大患之根本，外陸海三省及駐華人員，各有其表示及觀念，則何能使他相信日本乎。故林兼外相之叩頭外交，歟其向我華及英美叩頭，不若先向國內雙方叩頭。</p>
<h3>元宵</h3>
<p>— 田青</p>
<p>雪花在宇宙的大舞臺上，發瘋似地飛舞。曠野田疇建築和樹木……都披帶着皎潔得發光的外衣；却也隱隱透露着無能抵抗寒氣侵襲的慘戾。</p>
<p>牟迦小姑娘她們的茅屋，被遮蓋成了一座小小的雪山。屋裏有幾處飄進雪花的漏洞。天氣冷得使人抖索，牟迦小姑娘却不管這個，一勁兒醉心在那個小燈籠的摩弄上；聖誕夜被時間老人悄悄帶走了，燈沒有點過。如今元宵又到來了，可是小燈籠依然空着，沒有一根小臘燭。想到沒有臘燭點不成燈亮，她的小小的喜悅的心，不免又透進一層輕輕的焦急。她抬頭望一望老祖母，想從她那裏問出祖父怎麽還不回來。</p>
<p>祖母在兩年來往往保持着一個異乎尋常的神態：她像在凝視什麽：又彷彿什麽都沒有瞧進去似地老沉默着。臉上被生活磨過的皺紋，稀疏到幾乎全禿的鬢角！刻劃着無限記罣和回憶的痛苦。</p>
<p>這種不好理解的靜態，牟迦的焦急熱情的心被溶化了。她悄悄又低下頭來撫弄自己心愛的“寶貝”。</p>
<p>“祖父怎麽還不回來呢？”小姑娘一回兒望望天，又禁不住地問起祖母。</p>
<p>那個答覆，常常使牟迦不能滿意。實在她今天對老祖父特別關心，因為祖母告訴過她祖父是替牟迦買元宵的禮物和小臘燭去。</p>
<p>天一步步地昏黑了，雪花趁着風的瘋狂，更來得暴戾有力了，一陣陣結成了迷人的網。老祖父依然沒有回來。祖母對於牟迦的問話，更提不起答覆的精神，甚至一個人痴痴地自語了。</p>
<p>——這使牟迦發生了極大的疑問：“是不是雪下得太大了，迷亂祖父的歸路？”</p>
<p>照理小姑娘這麽聽明，對於老祖父的懷念，是會使祖母快樂得流淚的，她會將牟迦抱起來：吻她智慧的小眼睛，和烏黑得發光的柔髮，祈禱菩薩賜給牟迦更大更美滿的福遇。可是這會她祇微微搖一搖頭，一勁兒保持着那種痴呆的沉默。</p>
<p>忽地祖母向地下一跪，顫巍巍地合着一雙手在做禱告：“菩薩……神保佑</p>

<p>牟迦老祖父的平安……超拔牟迦父母的靈魂……賜給這可憐的孩子更大更多的快樂……</p>
<p>為什麽祖母老祈求着菩薩超拔牟迦父母的靈魂？小姑娘一點兒也不能明白，而且父母的印象也漸漸在她的記憶裏淡了，遺忘了。不過這會祖母的態度，使她無瑕的心，發生了一點兒恐怖，預感到這將是一個不幸的來臨。</p>
<p>一陣猛烈的風，挾着成團的雪朶，粗莽地衝開他們的門：祖母和屋裏的一切，同時地抖顫了。牟迦却歡樂得呌起來：“呵來了！祖父回來了！”一邊小姑娘忙着跑向門口去，准備迎接她慈和的老祖父。等到她發覺着什麽影子都沒有的時候，她又失望而生氣地重重關了門，一個兒在那裏發急。</p>
<p>挾在風聲裏遠遠有大陣的砲仗聲，這應該是菩薩下宮的時候：“遊燈”的隊伍該也快要出發了——那拖長的像遊龍的燈架，各種各色好看的燈籠……小姑娘心裏一陣熱，又連想到“燃火雲”，“燃火寶”（鄕間的殊俗，以燒柴火表示旺盛。）的熱鬧……</p>
<p>沉重而促急的敲門聲，打斷牟迦的幻想。小姑娘一點沒有挨延，飛快拔開門戶，讓尖削的冷風，推進來她的老祖父。</p>
<p>進來的老人，衣服上，帽子上，肩頭的小布袋上和花白的鬍髭上，都掛着一串串的雪鈴，在屋內暗淡的燈光下，發着閃燦的光——這使小姑娘尖銳的靈感，陡地記憶到教堂裏的聖誕老人，她驚異地呌着跳過去抓住老人凍僵的手，間他小臘燭有沒有帶回來。</p>
<p>老祖母這才驚醒着跑過來，替老人抖落臉上的雪朶，同時注視到他肩頭上被雪花打得淋濕的小布袋依然空空的，她的心裏深沉地響起一個絕望的驚呌：“沒有借到一點兒食糧？”</p>
<p>老祖父一　個勁兒靠在門板上，做着急促而又低微的喘息，全身發着寒冷饑餓的抖索。牟迦仍糾纏着要點燈籠的小臘燭，因為今晚是燈節的元宵！</p>

<p>袁牧之編導的「馬路天使，」內容全是描寫大都市下層社會生活的形態，如剃頭匠，報販，吹鼓手，琴師，野妓，鴇母……等形形色色，蔚爲大觀，是一部獨創國片新風格的喜劇。</p>
<p>沈西苓編導的「十字街頭，」已經全部竣事，並獲南京電檢會通過，是描寫現代青年失學，失戀，失業的三部曲。劇情深刻感人，導演成績特佳，中有「春天裏」名歌一支，富東方民歌情調，極是動聽，由關露，賀綠汀合作歌詞，賀綠汀作曲。</p>
<p>程歩高談瑛再度合作的「夢裏乾坤，」定於一星期內開拍，劇本出於名劇作家洪深教授手筆，劇情新頴生動，寫一個大家庭中的男女主僕在冬至夜各人所做的不同的夢境，劇本已由中央審查通過，並得奬語。</p>
<p>徐欣去編導的「生龍活虎，」近已完成，最後一幕的警匪大激戰，係至蘇州商請當地駐軍參加演出，一切槍砲，均用實彈射擊，緊張異常，爲本片生色不少。</p>
<h3>「街頭歌聲」一幕</h3>
<h3>民新新聞</h3>
<p>金擎宇夫人陳澹漪女士刻在南京産一女兒，金趁工餘之暇，特趕往南京慰問。</p>
<p>王桂林演戲以來之態度，一貫認真，從不稍懈，昔日「人道」「城市之夜」等片，早得社會稱道，近以在「新人道」中所任角色，係再度重演，乃更鄭重異常，故其成績之出色，笴無疑義。</p>
<p>日內「新人道」正拍荒年飢餓，煮食草根各景，因林楚楚，黎鏗，黎錫，王桂林等演來，其悲慘之景象，使在塲參觀者，觸景生情，多爲下淚。</p>
<p>「新人道」拍旅舍一景，胡戎與戴衍萬爲梁賽珠而相打，胡戎本佔優勢，一拳打得戴衍萬頭昏眼花，手指亦被劃破，但一轉眼間，梁賽珠又打了胡戎一個嘴巴，雖爲演戲，都是十足認真的打法，因女人而相打，應稱爲軟硬性表演。</p>
<h3>「復活」將搬上銀幕</h3>
<p>托爾斯泰的「復活」，是世界的名著，是千古不朽的傑作。在外國，許多有名的小説，都被搬上銀幕，「復活」不能例外，「復活」更創了新的紀錄，它前後已經有四次拍成影片了。</p>
<p>現在，天一導演左明，他正在埋頭寫「復活」的劇本，一俟編就，即送京審查。</p>

<h3>The Third Plenary Session Passes Resolution to Regularly Convene the National Assembly</h3>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Broadcast Speech on the Third Anniversary of the New Life Movement (Continued from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>㊀ Implement it conscientiously, do not engage in extravagance. We must have the spirit of "seeking truth from facts" in promoting the New Life Movement. It must be understood that the New Life Movement is a social movement, and it should be done with the spirit of engaging in social movements, not with the methods of doing political work, and even less should it be done with official boilerplate like "as per instructions" to go through the motions. It must be understood that the work of changing customs and habits cannot be done with a mere piece of paper. It must be done conscientiously to achieve real results. I have seen the publications of New Life Movement associations in various places, and most of them are official letters, meeting minutes, and speeches, while the records of work achievements are few. This is all evidence of not bringing out the spirit of "seeking truth from facts" and not being serious in doing things. In the past, there were more slogans and less work in the promotion, more plans and less implementation. In terms of promotion targets, attention was only paid to the upper layers of society and not to the lower layers, only to the main roads and not to the streets and alleys. Therefore, the results of the New Life Movement in the past three years have only achieved a temporary update on the surface, and have not achieved a permanent and thorough reform. From now on, those of us who are doing the work of the New Life Movement must pay attention to the actual improvement of the lives of the general public, do less cosmetic publicity, take the family as the starting point for promoting the New Life Movement, take the countryside as the center for promoting the New Life Movement, and take the general public as the target. Set an example, implement the New Life Movement ourselves first, and then persuade others. Then the effect of the work will surely be broad and rapid. If we only use posting slogans and writing official documents as promoting the New Life Movement, then the future of the New Life Movement is self-evident.</p>
<p>㊁ Concentrate strength and implement it thoroughly. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to revitalize the nation. The responsibility is great and the scope is broad. Of course, it is not something that we can do in three days or two. Therefore, in the steps of promotion, we must go from near to far, from shallow to deep. For example, if we can do the initial work of "orderliness" and "cleanliness" thoroughly throughout the country, then we will have made a lot of contributions to the movement of national revitalization. Therefore, in the future, we must choose a central task, implement it conscientiously, and not be too ambitious, which will result in doing everything but doing nothing well. Many of the plans and methods in the past have made this mistake. On the surface, they are very thorough, but in fact, nothing can be done. In the future, we must strive to change this drawback, choose a central task, divide the steps, implement them on schedule, and concentrate our strength to achieve our goals.</p>
<p>(3) Setting an Example and Extending to Others. All those who do the work of social mobilization must have a great personality and the power to use sincerity to influence others. Therefore, the promotion of the New Life Movement relies very little on the power of politics, but must be done by everyone setting an example and using the effort of "silent transformation." Because laws can only tell people not to do bad things, but cannot encourage people to do good things. If we want to change customs and habits, we must have the power of social sanctions and methods of spiritual infusion in order to be effective. Otherwise, why didn't we use government orders to enforce it at the beginning of the New Life Movement, but instead focused on the self-cultivation of the leaders, and used the method of "silent transformation" to extend it to others? The accumulated habits of society have been left over for thousands of years, and it is naturally not easy to change them. Therefore, we must use sincerity to influence them, so that "even metal and stone can be opened." If we do not implement the New Life Movement ourselves, but insist that others implement the New Life Movement, then we lack sincerity, and nothing is more hypocritical and ugly than this.</p>
<p>(4) Simplicity and Frugality, Consistency between Appearance and Reality. "Simplicity" and "frugality" are two important principles of the New Life Movement, and also the basis for implementing labor and thrift. The opposite of simplicity and frugality is extravagance and waste, which is absolutely harmful to nation-building work. Now, in any country that is building the nation with hardship, the government and society, from top to bottom, are united in taking frugality as the foundation and simplicity and frugality as the goal, so that they can save useful material resources, time resources, and human resources to save the country. At the beginning of the New Life Movement, everyone was able to pay attention to this point. For example, banquets not only set a time, but also advocated thrift and tried to avoid waste. But soon it returned to the previous state, with too much food, too much waste, and everything was unlimited, wasting time and energy, which is so regrettable. Everyone may think that this is a trivial matter, but we must know that if we want to build a modern country, we must start with small things in everything. Everything is accumulated from small things, from small to large, and from knowing the great way of revolutionary nation-building, so we know but do not act, or act but not for long, and often only do the surface. When I was studying abroad, I personally saw that foreign college students came out in the morning to sell newspapers and deliver milk, and studied during the day. Not only could they use this to subsidize their tuition and develop a foundation for self-reliance, but they also developed the habit of doing things in detail and practicing frugality. I really feel very envious of this, and this is what our Chinese students should also emulate. For example, young people in Germany often do the work of collecting waste paper, rags, and iron scraps themselves, collecting all the minute and useless items, using them for processing and storage as materials for material construction. In Chinese families, wherever it is hidden, there is waste paper everywhere, dirty and scattered, and no attention is paid to it. For example, all the larger roads in Nanjing seem to be very clean on the surface, but if you look carefully at the sides of the roads or in the streets and alleys, you can often find piles of scattered paper scraps, cloth strips, and garbage in front of the doors. The same is often true in schools, and even the blackboard in the classroom is not wiped by anyone, perfunctory and lazy, as if they do not see it. What kind of cleanliness and labor is this? For example, in terms of clothing, many students wear uniforms but wear their hats askew or leave their shirts exposed outside their uniforms, which is worse than not wearing uniforms at all. Moreover, they have lost the original meaning of wearing uniforms, and there is absolutely no question of neatness, etiquette, or appearance. This is just an example of food, clothing, housing, and transportation. There are countless other lifestyles that are not in line with the times. This kind of inconsistency between appearance and reality and constant awkwardness are all due to a misunderstanding of the purpose of the New Life Movement and a failure to connect the New Life Movement with the methods of saving the country. We must truly establish a new atmosphere, save the country, and build the nation, and we must vigorously practice simplicity, frugality, and do it thoroughly, inside and out, from beginning to end.</p>
<p>㊄ Sincerity and Enthusiasm, Self-Improvement and Unceasing Effort. We especially want to put this forward to encourage all those responsible for promoting the New Life Movement. In this year's work, we must achieve these two pieces of advice. I have said before that we have two major shortcomings in our habits in the past, which are the main reasons why our cause has not progressed and caught up with the great powers. The first is a lack of spirit and enthusiasm, and the second is a lack of continuous spirit. Because it does not originate from sincerity, although it is very tense at the beginning, it will inevitably become slack after a while. In everything, we only seek to deal with the past and do not seek actual results, so foreigners ridicule us for only having three minutes of heat. Also, because we lack enthusiastic emotions, we feel uninspired by anything. Although it is not intentional laziness, we ultimately cannot muster the courage to move forward vigorously, and the result is inevitably close to going through the motions. As for the second point, if we lack the spirit of continuous self-improvement and unceasing effort, not only will our progress be slow, but our existing achievements will often not be maintained. Therefore, the ancients said that we should "renew ourselves daily" and "strive for perfection." These two maxims are the true spirit of the New Life Movement. Although I have said these words last year, I think they are extremely important, so I will put them forward again to encourage everyone. The above points are my contributions to those responsible for promoting the New Life Movement, and they have a great relationship with our general public. We must know that "the rise and fall of the world is the responsibility of every man." Now that the national crisis has reached its final and serious juncture, if not everyone takes on the responsibility of saving the country, seeking survival, and revitalizing the nation, then the country will have much less hope, and the date of national revitalization will be delayed because of it. The purpose of the New Life Movement is to fully express the four dimensions of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame in everyone's food, clothing, housing, and transportation, and to implement it unremittingly, so that our individuals and society can renew themselves daily in the four aspects of morality, intelligence, physical fitness, and community, morality can become more and more noble, knowledge can increase day by day, physical fitness can become stronger and stronger, and the spirit of unity, cooperation, and mutual assistance can increase day by day. Not only individuals, but also the whole society and the people of the whole country can be like this, and then our country can be fundamentally saved, and our nation will surely be revived. Now that we have recognized that the New Life Movement is the only way to revitalize the nation, then every one of our citizens should conscientiously implement the New Life Movement, conscientiously promote the New Life Movement, go from small to large, extend it to others, and reach the point of renewing ourselves daily. I hope that our compatriots will no longer wait and see from today, make a resolution, and work hard to lay the foundation for the revitalization of the nation.

Alas, the time of mourning has passed." He's couplet read, "Borrowing from the praise of the central authorities, secret and meticulous planning relates to the most important plans," and "Comrades support the building, and good friends are lost in the midst of hardship and danger." The funeral committee decided that on the morning of the 21st at 10 a.m., the body would be moved from the Renxiao Funeral Home to Pilo Temple.

<h3>Going to Bailingmiao</h3>
<p>— Our Reporter Qian Hua</p>
<p>A hundred miles of uninhabited Mongolian grassland. The life of soldiers on the ice and snow front line beyond the Great Wall</p>
<p>The slogan "National Defense First" is popular in various countries now, and the trendy Chinese are naturally following suit, shouting it loudly. Since the Suiyuan War began, the call for national defense construction has permeated the country, and batches of慰勞 inspection groups have flooded into Suiyuan like huge waves. News reporters who specialize in following the crowd are even less of an exception. As a result, the long-silent ancient city of Guihua has unexpectedly regained its prosperity, and the so-called national defense communications have also been scattered in newspapers and magazines, becoming first-class contemporary articles. I had long thought of going to the war zone to sightseeing and join in the fun, but official and private matters gathered,</p>
<p>It was not until January 13th that I was able to make the trip. I took the Huping train north, transferred to the Pingsui Road to Suiyuan, and then went to Bailingmiao and other places. I stayed in Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangjiakou, Datong, Pingdiquan, Baotou, and other places along the way. I returned to Shanghai on February 5th. The time spent inspecting in various places ranged from a few hours to no more than five or six days. How can we talk about observation in such a whirlwind trip? Fortunately, friends along the way provided many interesting materials, and there were unexpected gains in the car and旅邸. Combined with the on-the-spot inspections, I have recorded some fragments. Readers who care about the national defense front line may find it a bit interesting.</p>
<p>㊀ Northwest Military Fortress</p>
<p>Bailingmiao is located on the north side of Yinshan, 330 miles away from Guihua City and 240 miles away from Wuchuan County. It can be reached by car in one day. It is located on the Mongolian Plateau, with an altitude of about 2,000 meters. Its terrain is surrounded by mountains, with a plain in the middle. The hills are surrounded, and the clear streams meander around. The mountains are steep and majestic, easy to defend and difficult to attack. Since the fall of Rehe and the loss of the six counties in Chahar, Suiyuan has become a barrier for the northwestern provinces, shielding Shanxi and Shaanxi. If Suiyuan is not defended, Qin and Jin will not be ours, and the entire northwest will be in even greater danger. Judging from the terrain of Suiyuan, the Yinshan Mountains stretch across the central part of the province, forming a natural Great Wall, and Bailingmiao is the protection of Yinshan. If Bailingmiao is in the hands of the enemy, Suiyuan will be threatened by others at all times. The front can peek at Wuchuan, cross Yinshan, and directly attack Guihua; the side can harass Guyang, take Baotou, and撫 my back, making our army unable to take care of each other from beginning to end. In fact, Bailingmiao has become the only military fortress in the northwest today. Chairman Jiang solemnly stated: "The recovery of Bailingmiao is the starting point for the revival of our nation and the biggest key to our safety." This statement not only refers to the national spirit, but also contains significant meaning in terms of marching terrain. Geographer Zhang Qiyun published an article on the military geography of Suiyuan Province in China's New Theory, explaining the special importance of Bailingmiao's terrain, which is very insightful on national defense construction. He said: "The Yinshan Mountains were the border between China and the Huns during the Qin and Han Dynasties. The modern Suiyuan Province has both the front and back of the mountains. This is where the current national situation is different from the past. Therefore, the current military fortress must be moved northward. In the past, Sai Xian勒铭燕然, and Yanran was the Hangai Mountain. Military preparations were made in the Hangai Mountain area of Outer Mongolia. This could still be done in the early years of the Republic of China, but today the responsibility of the national army is to firmly defend the Mongolian Plateau within Suiyuan. There are many plains between the Yellow River and the Huai River. Only the small mountains near Xuzhou are sparse and are places that soldiers must contend for. The importance of Bailingmiao's terrain is also the reason. The hills around it undulate for nine seats, like a city. The Baili River flows through it, and the east of the river is the market street, which is where Han and Mongolian trade is located. The west of the river is a lama temple, and there are dozens of Mongolian yurts on the side of the temple. In the past, the Mongolian Local Autonomous Political Committee worked here. Bailingmiao is a major transportation route in the northwest. Internally, please take a route through Wuchuan to Guisui, and another route through Guyang to Baotou; externally, one route leads to Outer Mongolia, and the other route leads to Xinjiang. Therefore, the significance of the recovery of Bailingmiao this time is extraordinary. Therefore, we can eliminate the threat of foreigners to northern Suiyuan and cut off their westward path. We hope that the national army will build an extremely solid military fortress here to permanently eliminate the desire to peep. However, the terrain of the Mongolian Plateau is flat and easy, and trees are rare. Aircraft surveillance is very clear. I hope that our air force will take on the responsibility of defending the airspace." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Prelude to the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchao</p>
<p>We don't need prophets to speculate, and we don't have to expect that the land we lost without a fight after "September 18" will not fall into the hands of others without a fight, let alone be returned to us without a fight. In other words, we will not be able to recover an inch of lost land without war in the future, and we will not be able to save our 30 million compatriots in dire straits without war. Recently, discussions in various parts of the country have clearly told us that the people of the whole country have now recognized this point. Even the separatists and speculators can only use the slogan of "unanimous foreign resistance" to do the trick of "catching fish in troubled waters". The government has not had any facts to resist insult in the past six years, but it can still gain the support of the general public, precisely because the people believe that the government is actively building basic defense work, believe that the government is determined to recover lost land, and believe that it will not abandon an inch of land again in the "September 18" style in the future. This ray of hope to resist insult has affected our attitude in all aspects. Our ideal political or economic system, the talents of our ideal leader, and even what we usually yearn for, such as "freedom of thought" and "equal opportunities", can all be temporarily put down at this time, under the conditions of preparing to resist the enemy and recover lost land. Today, theories, philosophies, and doctrines should all be put back in their place. This is not simplification of thought, but the price of urgent survival. We hope that the government understands why the people support it and obey it in times of emergency, and we also hope that Mr. Chiang Kai-shek will think about why everyone (including many non-hero worshippers) is so concerned about his safety and supports his rule. At the same time, we also hope that the party and country officials will pay attention: After "September 18", the people's feelings towards the Nanjing government have only recently begun to gradually improve, because the general public with a little knowledge and no background seems to feel that the government has indeed made considerable progress recently. This success is directly proportional to our hope of resisting insult; the War of Resistance is the only hope for the survival of our nation, and for the government and the Kuomintang, this is the only way out.</p>
<p>Many people think that our combat power will never reach the level of resisting the enemy: we are preparing, and others are of course preparing, and our rate may not be much faster than theirs, so we must actually borrow external force to contain the enemy. Therefore, some people advocate allying with Russia, some advocate begging for mercy from Britain and the United States, some advocate allying with Japan or being pro-Japanese as a fundamental solution, and even today there are still people who advocate waiting for the League of Nations to rise again. In the eyes of experts, I believe these claims have their own complexity, but here we don't seem to need to borrow the knowledge of experts. We can use a few common sense principles to review them. We all know that in international relations, whenever the word "alliance" is used, and its need is not in the relationship between each other, but in dealing with a third country together, both sides must be able to help each other under the principle of respecting each other's sovereignty, such as the alliance between France and Russia against Germany, and the alliance between Japan and Germany against Russia. At the same time, if allied countries want to maintain the spirit of mutual assistance, their strength should be similar; otherwise, one country must be in a protected position, and as a result, both sides cannot stand on an equal footing, and there does not seem to be a free guard method in the international community. Can the situation between China and Japan or China and Russia meet these conditions for mutual assistance? Simply put, our current strength is not enough to ally with Japan, nor is it enough to ally with Russia. Even if we need to ally with Japan or Russia, we must first be qualified to ally with people or be allied with people. As for being pro-Japanese, that is simply not a solution, and we can only oppose it to the end. Whether the international community can "rise again" is something we non-experts dare not speculate; however, even if its head is raised, I personally doubt how much practical help it can give us. If there is another investigation team, we will at most spend another one or two million on recruitment fees and preparation fees. They will of course make another report. Our experts can get hundreds or thousands more of these more accurate numbers, and intellectuals can publish a few more papers. Besides that, I dare say that everything will remain the same. The three northeastern provinces are still in the hands of others, and the special zone in the gray dream is still only continuing to "clarify". A famous British journalist said it well, the League of Nations has become a refrigerator for international problems. We Chinese should especially appreciate this! Britain and the United States each have their own interests in the Far East, and each has its own concerns. Of course, they are quite wary of any country that conflicts with their interests and their power. If someone is calculating Britain's colonies, Britain will of course defend itself; if someone wants to control China's market, and Britain already has a considerable commercial base in China, the British will of course think of ways. Their methods may be of direct or indirect benefit to us, or we may be able to stop under someone else's eaves to avoid the wind and rain for a while. However, we must not forget that Britain is a mature and prudent country. Although it may sometimes be fooled by Europeans, it is not as concerned about China as it is about India; and any aggressor against China, as long as it guarantees that it will never develop towards its colonies, how can we not know that under considerable circumstances, it will not form a "gentleman's agreement" or similar agreement with this aggressor against us? For example, if Japan decides to promote its continental policy and unconditionally abandon its maritime policy, we have no confidence in how Britain will treat it.</p>
<p>There is no need to say these obvious words, just because our own strength is indeed weak, and the aggressor's minions are really fierce, many compatriots cannot avoid having all kinds of excessive奢望. The greater the奢望 in diplomacy, the lower our self-confidence; the lower the self-confidence, the more difficult it is to achieve unification and resist the enemy. Diplomacy is of course necessary, because facts tell us that any two-country war in the future has the potential to trigger a world war. Moreover, the battle lines on both sides have already formed, and we seem to have to prepare to join one side. However, with our current strength, neither side will welcome us, unless we are willing to be slaves to others, or eternal "Chinese workers". We can only bury our heads and work hard to build our strength, prepare ourselves, and when the time is right, start the fighting force, and at the same time gradually make people feel that we are not a country without any strength. Our current problem is not which country to ally with, but how to build considerable strength in the shortest period of time. With considerable strength, we have our own diplomacy; without the backing of considerable strength, our diplomacy is just like what Napoleon said: "A blackmail tool for those who want to invade, and an organ for those who are invaded to beg for peace." Recently, some people think that if so-and-so is appointed as the diplomat, we will have great hope of allying with Russia or Japan. This kind of thinking is as naive and simple as when Mr. Jiang was detained in Xi'an, many anesthetized youths thought that as long as Chiang Kai-shek was resolved, we could immediately resist the enemy.</p>
<p>Since we have identified our way out, we must think about how we can survive from now until the day of the frontal conflict; not only survive, but also prepare and build. We advocate resisting the war for survival and for recovering lost land, not for a moment of excitement, regardless of everything, to fight the enemy. The so-called slogan of "scorched earth resistance" can only be used to express our determination to prepare for the war, but it cannot be used as a proposition, let alone a method. Although we do not seek to win, we should at least avoid the ending of the whole country turning into scorched earth. When we talk about war, we are of course referring to a large-scale modern war, the mobilization of the whole country, not just street fighting, hand-to-hand combat, and contact. If the environment allows us, we hope to prepare at least the ability to continue fighting for half a year. However, whether the enemy and our own internal forces allow us to do this is a problem that needs to be prepared for. In other words, on the one hand, we must have the freedom to build and prepare, and on the other hand, we must always be prepared to deal with the enemy's gradual division, sabotage, incitement, and all other soft aggressive means. The enemy wants to get something for nothing, because he has already tasted the sweetness. His most economical method of aggression is to disrupt our steps, incite us, and use our poverty and lack of national concept to cause riots or panic within us, so as to give him an excuse to seize the opportunity. If we do not give him any such opportunity, whether he is willing to take other methods with sacrifice conditions is not inevitable in the eyes of many people. We believe that from now until the time when both sides do not hesitate to have a frontal conflict, there is still a period of緩和 with each other. 緩和 is of course a relative term, and in fact it is a period when the enemy implements soft aggression and we endure the pain to deal with it.</p>
<p>But enduring pain without a plan is just the ability of a slave. In order to cope with the situation in this transitional period, we hope that the government will quickly decide on a comprehensive approach to the current situation. Rather than gradually specializing locally, it is better to think in advance: which places can be temporarily abandoned, and which places we absolutely cannot give way; where is our lowest lifeline, and where is our highest point of tolerance. It is precisely because we have identified the direction and set the goal that we are willing to endure the current small節. Tolerance is of course a last resort and a shame in personal feeling, but we only have this way to get through the current situation. Some people may ask: When will we tolerate it? This cannot be answered. We certainly do not know the future, and we do not know our current strength. The military secrets of any country cannot be publicly reported to its citizens. At present, we ordinary people can only completely trust the government, and at the same time, a government that is not built on the rock of public opinion cannot last long.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Send Economic Envoys to China</h3>
<p>Kenji Kodama to Head Investigation Group; Some Say Each Individual Will Come Alone</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the establishment of the Hayashi Cabinet, Japanese diplomacy first changed its previous attitude and decided to base itself on economic diplomacy. The specific work is to send economic envoys to China to reciprocate the Chinese economic inspection group that came to Japan in the autumn of the year before last. This plan has been officially decided, and the delegation is scheduled to leave Japan for China on March 12. The main purpose of the inspection group is to reciprocate the Japan-China Trade Association. It is organized by the Japanese members of the association, and Kenji Kodama, the general manager of the former Zhengjin Bank, who is well-versed in the situation in China and whose credit in the Chinese financial world is well-established, is elected as the head of the group. After arriving in China, he will attend the meeting of the Shanghai Japan-China Trade Association and meet with important Chinese figures to exchange views. (20th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The economic inspection group sent by Japan to Europe and the United States has been officially decided yesterday, with Shigekujiro Kadono as the head of the group. The head of the inspection group to China has also been decided, with Qianji Erwang as the director. It is heard that Kenzaburo Kato, the president of the Bank of Korea, Noboru Otani, the president of Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Hyakutaro Miyakikawa, the former president of Mitsubishi Corporation, and Seijiro Miyajima, the president of Mouth Qing Spinning Co., Ltd., and Reisuke Ishida, the executive director of Mitsui Bussan Co., Ltd., will also join. In addition, there are also three important figures from the financial circles of Osaka participating, such as Saburo Nango, the president of the Japan Cotton Yarn Co., Masatsune Ogura, the general director of Sumitomo Joint Venture, and one other person has not yet been determined. The delegation will depart for Shanghai on March 15, in time to convene the Japan-China Trade Association Conference. There is great hope here for the trip of Kodama and his party to China. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to reliable sources, the leaders of the Japanese economic community do not intend to organize a group, but will each go to China alone to conduct inspections. The travel date must be determined after receiving a reply from China. (Central News Agency, 20th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Capital: Italian Governor-General Injured in Bombing</h3>
<p>Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff Severely Wounded; Many Others Injured; Rome Shaken</p>
<p>[Rome] According to a dispatch from Addis Ababa, the capital of Abyssinia, General Graziani, the Italian Governor-General of Abyssinia, was slightly injured yesterday afternoon in an attack by natives. General Li Ruoda, the Italian Air Force Deputy Chief of Staff, was seriously injured. It is reported that General Graziani, accompanied by important officials of the Allied nations and several native chiefs, went to various churches in Addis Ababa yesterday afternoon to celebrate the birth of Prince Napoleon, grandson of the Italian King. Unexpectedly, a group of Abyssinian natives threw bombs at the civil and military authorities and native chiefs along the way. The Governor-General was injured by the bombs, but his injuries were minor. General Li Ruoda's injuries, however, were more serious. Abenha, the leader of the Coptic Church, an Abyssinian, was also injured by the bombs. There were many other injured, but the exact number is currently unknown. The news has greatly shaken the people here, because General Graziani, the Governor-General of Abyssinia, commanded a large army in Italian Somaliland two years ago to conquer Abyssinia and achieved outstanding military exploits. General Li Ruoda was originally the commander of the Rome Air Defense Force and was highly regarded. He only went to Abyssinia from Italy two months ago to organize an air base there. As for Abenha, he is also quite well-known, because at the beginning of Italy's attack on Abyssinia, Abenha was one of the first to surrender to the Italian army. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The details of this incident have now been officially announced by the Roman authorities. It is said that when Mr. Graziani was distributing gifts to the poor in churches and mosques, Abyssinians dissatisfied with Italian rule mingled in the crowd and threw hand grenades. In addition to Mr. Graziani and Mr. Li being injured, many Abyssinian people in the crowd were also injured. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>US Battleships Must Equal Britain, etc.</h3>
<p>US Naval Undersecretary Statement</p>
<p>[Washington] Naval Undersecretary Edison is currently planning to investigate the shipbuilding plants established by the US Navy Department and private individuals in preparation for the government's decision to build large numbers of warships to match the new programs of the British Navy. The Navy Department's intention is that the United States should maintain at least parity with Britain in terms of battleships, so as not to disrupt the naval ratio between Britain, Japan, and the United States. However, whether US shipyards can keep pace with Britain's large-scale shipbuilding is a major question, especially this year. Yesterday, Mr. Peng Haide spoke in the House of Representatives, saying that if the United States could avoid the arms race, he would strongly oppose the United States joining it. Today, President Roosevelt warned about the lack of steel for naval shipyards, saying that the government may soon have to step in, but he does not know if it is necessary to establish new legislation. When asked if the government had discussed reopening the Charleston arms factory in Virginia to speed up the Navy's program, the President replied, "No." Furthermore, Labor Secretary Perkins stated that the Navy shipyards' chances of getting steel are gradually improving. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The British government recently released a white paper on the national defense program, which included the British Navy's shipbuilding plan for the next fiscal year, including three battleships, seven cruisers, and two aircraft carriers. Today, when President Roosevelt met with reporters, he was asked whether the United States should also formulate a naval shipbuilding program to compete after the British shipbuilding plan was released. The President declined to answer, only saying that it is currently urgent to find steel to complete the shipbuilding program currently underway, and this difficulty is expected to be resolved soon. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Arms Expansion Unrelated to Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Newspaper's Report is Nervous</p>
<p>[London] The London correspondent of the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun believes that the British advocacy of rearmament indicates that Britain will abandon its past policy of Anglo-Japanese friendship. Government officials here generally regard this statement as ridiculous, saying that Britain's policy towards Japan has not changed to date, and the reasons for Britain's expansion of armaments have been stated in the House of Commons. In short, Britain wants to make its military strength commensurate with its responsibilities. Moreover, the realization of Britain's plan has been unanimously recognized by European countries, and even Germany and Italy have not criticized it. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Canadian Fleet Aims to Avoid War</h3>
<p>Parliament Passes Military Budget</p>
<p>Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister King today issued a declaration stating that Canada will not be bound by any constraints or drawn into the vortex of war at future British Imperial Conferences without the consent of Parliament. Mr. King's declaration was issued after the Canadian Parliament concluded a four-day long debate on the government's $35 million national defense budget. Mr. King further stated that Canada does not want to be regarded as occupying an equal position, and that the defense of Canada's coast depends entirely on Great Britain. However, if Canada does not make its own efforts, it is tantamount to completely relying on others. Therefore, Canada's self-defense is fulfilling a part of its mission for all democratic politics in the world. Parliament then discussed a motion of no confidence in the government, which was ultimately defeated by 191 votes to 17. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>US Fleet's Regular Annual Maneuvers</h3>
<p>Total of 200 Warships; Exercises in North Pacific</p>
<p>[Washington] Officials announced today that the entire US fleet of approximately 200 warships will conduct its annual maneuvers in the North Pacific starting on April 16. The area will be a large triangle of 2 million square miles, with the Aleutian Islands as the apex, the Peninsula of Unalaska as the western corner, and the US Pacific coast as the eastern corner. For about six weeks, the ships will depart from San Diego and Saint Peter ports, advancing in a fan-shaped formation until reaching 180 degrees. However, due to the constraints of the Gentlemen's Agreement between Japan and the United States, they may not cross that line. Aircraft and aircraft carriers belonging to the fleet will participate in the maneuvers, and bases in Hawaii and the US mainland may also be within the scope of the exercises. As for the exercise plan, officials are keeping it strictly secret, only saying that they will conduct Fleet Plan No. 18, with Hawaii as the center. (National News, 19th)</p>
<h3>Germany Has One Car for Every Fifty People</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The International Automobile Exhibition held its opening ceremony at 11:00 this morning. Ministers and leading figures from the Party and military attended. First, Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech, followed by a speech by Führer Hitler, who praised the motorization cause, saying, "When we came to power in February 1933, the average German had one car for every 100 people. Today, the average is one car for every 50 people. But compared to the United States, where there is one car for every five people, we are still far behind. It can be seen that we still need to make continuous efforts to accelerate the production of cars to make them accessible to the masses." The Führer then mentioned the raw material problem, saying, "Germany must not be subject to foreign restrictions in terms of raw material supply. This is a must. In terms of science, we have been able to use chemical methods to produce rubber and gasoline ourselves. Coal and iron will also be inexhaustible. All of this is because I am determined to ensure that the domestic automobile manufacturing industry uses purely domestic raw materials, so I spare no effort to do so. In short, if the free economic system can solve all the problems caused by domestic production, it would be good. Otherwise, we can only implement a controlled economy and continue to promote the Four-Year Economic Plan. I have said this repeatedly, and I hereby repeat it to clarify it." (Havas, 20th)</p>

<p>Germany, Italy, and Portugal Also Issue Bans; Effective from Midnight Last Night</p>
<p>[Berlin] The order prohibiting volunteers from entering Spain has been announced this morning and will take effect from midnight today. The order, signed by German Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Neurath, prohibits Germans from traveling to Spain or Spanish colonies to participate in the civil war. Spanish Morocco is also included in the ban. The order also authorizes the Minister of the Interior to prevent those going to Spain from departing from Germany, or from feigning moral high ground, and prohibits the recruitment of soldiers in Germany to participate in the Spanish Civil War; violators will be subject to imprisonment.

<p>[Rome] Italy, in accordance with the resolutions of the London Non-Intervention Committee, has formally promulgated an order prohibiting volunteers from entering Spain. This order will take effect at midnight tonight, and the provisions for punishing violations have also been announced at the same time. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: The Portuguese government has recently issued a decree prohibiting the Portuguese people from participating in the Spanish Civil War. Those who have already participated in the Spanish Civil War must return to the country within one month. Foreign nationals participating in the Spanish Civil War will not be allowed to return to Portugal within five years. (National News, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Czechoslovakia has formally promulgated an order in accordance with the resolutions of the Non-Intervention Committee, prohibiting the recruitment of volunteers within its borders to go to Spain and prohibiting them from transiting through the country. Provisions for punishing violations have also been announced at the same time. It is reported that the Belgian government will also announce a similar ban before midnight today, but at the same time, because the French-Spanish border will be closed tonight, volunteers from various countries are rushing to cross the border, especially new recruits from Britain, France, and Germany. The Spanish People's Front is making great efforts to promote recruitment in the last five minutes, so the number of those recruited to Spain today will greatly increase. According to reliable estimates, the number of Italian soldiers serving in the Spanish battlefield had increased to 55,000 before the fall of Malaga. There are fewer Germans. In recent weeks, very few Germans have crossed the border into Spain. Furthermore, approximately 1,700 to 2,000 officers will be required for this measure of monitoring volunteers and military supplies entering Spain, at a cost of approximately one million pounds per year. This expense will be borne by the countries of the Non-Intervention Committee, based on the proportion of the annual League of Nations dues paid by each country according to its financial resources and population. In addition to stipulating the deployment of patrol ships to patrol the Spanish coast, the monitoring plan will also station 60 commissioners in Portugal and 180 on the French border to carry out surveillance. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the prohibition of volunteers from going to Spain, orders have been issued separately by the countries concerned and will be implemented simultaneously from midnight today. As for the two matters of monitoring the land borders of Spain and the navies of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Portugal separately monitoring the waters near Spain, they will only be implemented on March 6. The detailed plan for naval monitoring is currently being drafted urgently by experts from various countries. Approximately the naval fleets of Britain, France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and Portugal will separately engage in monitoring within their designated areas, and the monitoring costs will also be borne separately. As for the issue of monitoring the Portuguese border, the Portuguese government has accepted in principle that Britain will send inspectors to work with personnel sent by the Portuguese government to monitor the land border between that country and Spain. However, some details have not yet been resolved and are currently being discussed by representatives from Britain and Portugal. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>Lisbon: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a communiqué explaining the attitude adopted by Portugal regarding the measures for monitoring non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, stating that Portugal has consistently refused to establish an international monitoring mechanism within its territory, but in order to avoid the failure of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, the Portuguese government has voluntarily invited friendly Britain to send multiple British inspectors to Portugal to investigate whether Portugal is strictly fulfilling its adopted commitments. However, these inspectors are not representatives of international organizations and do not have the same qualifications as the international monitors stipulated in the Adjustment Committee's plan. The Portuguese government hopes that the countries concerned will recognize that Portugal's attitude is out of goodwill. If this is not the case, if the countries cannot accept Portugal's position, then Portugal will not hesitate to withdraw from the Adjustment Committee and act on its own, so that the Adjustment Committee can still obtain the necessary unanimous approval.

<h3>Philippine President Quezon Arrives in New York</h3>
<p>Will Go to Washington to Meet Roosevelt; To Convene US-Philippine Business Conference</p>
<p>[New York] Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon arrived here today. New York Mayor LaGuardia formally greeted him at the Pennsylvania Station. In addition, there were approximately 2,000 welcomers, including Howard, the editor of the New York World-Telegram, half of whom were Philippine expatriates. After arriving at the station, Quezon went to the Ambassador Hotel to stay. He then made a statement saying that he came to meet with President Roosevelt. As for the issue of the US-Philippine business conference, he could not express his opinions until he had met with President Roosevelt. The issue of establishing an army base in the Philippines would not be brought up for discussion in Washington. Quezon also stated regarding the issue of the courts that the Philippine Supreme Court is the court in the Philippines that handles final appeals, and a two-thirds majority of the judges must pass a resolution to invalidate a certain law. Regarding President Roosevelt's judicial plan, he did not want to arbitrarily add or subtract from it, but he said that the two-thirds majority rule in the Philippine court is based on the principle that a one-person majority in a five-to-four vote does not have the right to veto the decisions of the government or parliament. Quezon added that a US-Philippine reciprocal trade agreement would benefit both countries. As for the current situation in the Philippines, Quezon said, "I don't want to boast now, but we are gradually developing. Gold mining companies have been established as opportunities arise, and the people are gradually trusting the government. Although there are still pessimists, capital has been flowing in in large quantities." Quezon will go to Washington tomorrow night or Sunday, after which he will travel to Europe with his wife and daughter to attend the coronation ceremony of King George VI of England. His wife, however, will postpone her departure because she is presiding over the Catholic Congress in Manila and was unable to come with him. (National News, 19th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt told reporters today that Philippine Commonwealth President Quezon will hold a meeting with him and officials from the State Department at the White House. A banquet has been scheduled for March 2 or 3. (National News, 19th)</p>
<p>Naples: The newly appointed US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Maynard, announced today that he will go to Washington no later than Thursday for instructions, and then depart for Manila to take office. The President thought it best for me to stay in Washington for a month to participate in the US-Philippine business talks, and then go to the Philippines. (National News, 19th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Washington Post reported today that although Congress cannot grant the Philippines commercial rights superior to those of Cuba after the Philippines gains full independence, the United States is very concerned about maintaining the economic stability of the Philippines during the transition period. Relations between the two sides may be adjusted by concluding a reciprocal trade agreement. The agreement concluded between Cuba and the United States can serve as a precedent.

<h3>The Japanese Diet Expected to Conclude Successfully</h3>
<p>The Military and Political Parties Unwilling to Directly Clash; Finance Minister Ketsujo Explains Sound Policies</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The 70th Diet, since its opening, with differing views between the military and political parties on the current situation, brewed an atmosphere of dissolving the Diet. However, after five days of discussion, this atmosphere gradually dissipated. Initially, the political parties expressed passive dissatisfaction with the Hayashi Cabinet, repeatedly expressing some of their opinions during Diet questioning. However, the military, holding the key to dissolving the Diet, realized that although a decisive attitude was warranted, it would only cause chaos in the political world and fail to make the political parties recognize the current situation. Thus, they seemed to decide to first pass the budget and related bills through the Diet, and then implement the second phase of the reform movement. Furthermore, the government also vigorously sought a satisfactory conclusion to the Diet. Therefore, these circumstances, along with the political parties' lack of courage, have averted the crisis of a direct clash between the two sides. As a result, future Diet deliberations on the budget, tax increase proposals, etc., will be free of tension. However, there may be minor attacks from political parties from time to time, and in this way, proceeding towards the closing, the Diet is expected to conclude successfully.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the content of the speech delivered by Speaker of the House Tomita concerning the speech given by Hamada Kunimatsu of the Seiyukai on January 21st in the House of Representatives, a document explaining the matter was submitted to the Army authorities. The Army authorities replied on the 19th, stating that the Army currently has no intention of making Hamada's speech a problem. Speaker Tomita believes that this issue has been completely resolved and will not report the matter to the Diet.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee reopened yesterday at 1:40 PM, continuing the morning's closed session. At 2:25 PM, the closed session was lifted and a recess was taken. It reconvened at 5:15 PM, adjourned without conducting any business. The House of Representatives Budget Committee reconvened at 10:20 AM on the 20th, continuing the previous meeting. Katsu Masanori of the Minseito party took the stage to question, stating that the revised budget still emphasizes national defense expenditure while neglecting industrial expenditure. The previous cabinet's large budget of 2 billion yuan led to rising prices, and trade may be affected by the transfer of manpower for military supplies. Concerns about the digestibility of public bonds and the rebound of interest rates may also arise as a result. However, it seems that the anxiety mentioned above can be removed by stopping the implementation of this plan. But assuming that the anxiety cannot still be removed, are there any countermeasures? Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that the cause of rising prices cannot necessarily be removed simply by revising the previous cabinet's budget. However, in general, the amount of suspension of use is expensive for promoting the tendency of rising prices. Furthermore, rising prices are due to too many speculators, so this point can be removed a little. In addition, adjustments to interest rate relations and trade can be left to nature to slightly ease the impact in these areas. I intend to avoid using administrative means as much as possible. However, rising prices are a global phenomenon, and this point must also be noted. As for the problem of local fiscal adjustment grants questioned previously, I intend to quickly draft a finalized plan for the grants and submit it to the next Diet session.</p>
<p>Katsu Masanori asked, what are the specific policies for expanding productivity? What is the policy of mobilizing financial institutions, and what are your views on international economicism?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ketsujo replied, that to expand productivity, it is necessary to mobilize the Bank of Japan and other financial institutions. This has been said before. Although Japan does not have the international economic power of the United States, if it has the momentum, it intends to use tariff policies.</p>
<p>Katsu Masanori asked, will Finance Minister Ketsujo abandon the doctrine of sound finance and rely solely on the issuance of public bonds?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that I firmly advocate sound finance. In other words, I reject the policy that it does not matter how much money is borrowed. However, given the current situation, due to national defense expenditure and other related factors, it is inevitable to admit that increasing the issuance of public bonds is an unavoidable measure. When the market price of public bonds is above the issue price, there is naturally no need to worry about digesting public bonds. However, if it falls below the issue price, digestion will be hindered. Therefore, it is necessary to seek to revitalize the industry to fill the gap in national defense expenditure and other expenses.</p>
<p>Katsu Masanori asked, why is the amount of suspension of use by the Army and Navy not specified in detail?</p>
<p>Vice Minister of the Army Umezu replied that after tightening the budget on the Army's side, the result of successive tightening is that savings have reached the extreme. However, explaining the details one by one is both time-consuming and technically difficult.</p>
<p>Navy Minister Yonai also gave the same response.</p>
<p>Katsu Masanori asked, in light of the current situation of rising prices, does the government intend to reinstate the reduction in salaries for government officials?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that we must not threaten livelihoods, so there is currently no intention to reinstate the salary reduction.</p>
<p>Okuchi Kiroku asked, what is the meaning of the current cabinet's so-called "renewal of all government affairs"? Prime Minister Hayashi replied that the renewal of all government affairs involves a wide range of issues. The fundamental is to enrich national defense, develop the economy, and unite people's hearts. Taken as a whole, this is the renewal of all government affairs.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives General Assembly on the 20th convened at 1:40 PM and immediately entered the agenda to present a bill to amend the tariff reduction law and a bill to amend Law No. 51 of the Taisho 14th year (submitted by the government). Finance Minister Ketsujo explained the reasons for the proposals. Next, Okazaki Kyujiro of the Minseito party took the stage to question, stating that if the management of exchange rates and imports is inevitably reduced, the entry of iron will inevitably be reduced, and the price of iron will inevitably be high. What are the views of the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Commerce on this point? The total value of export trade is 2.5 billion, 37 kinds, but taxing 300 million of the 5 kinds is difficult to understand. I hope to withdraw the export tax bill.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that in the near future, the export of Japanese goods will not be reduced, so it is necessary to first seek to revitalize domestic production, so as to increase national income, the ability to digest public bonds, and the revitalization of export trade, and then slowly seek the abundance of material supply. This is my fundamental concept. The export control tax law still contradicts my concept. These two laws are not only for the purpose of taxing export goods. The world is working hard to prevent Japanese goods. To open it up, this bill is set up, intending to use the financial resources obtained from the implementation of this law to seek the smooth development of the entire Japanese export trade.</p>
<p>Minister of Commerce Godo replied that the demand for iron in the coming year is estimated at 500,000 tons of steel and 370,000 tons of pig iron. However, according to the rapid increase in production equipment, the production can be increased by 550,000 tons. Moreover, from foreign countries, such as the United States and France, 150,000 tons can be imported. In general, it is planned not to import expensive iron from foreign countries, but to strive to increase the amount of domestic production. Regarding the fuel problem, a concrete plan will soon be drafted.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives Budget Committee temporarily adjourned at 12:20 AM today and reconvened at 2:26 PM. After Army Minister Sugiyama gave a public explanation regarding the Suiyuan issue requested by Matsuda Takechiyo of the Minseito party at the previous closed session, Okuchi continued to question, stating that strengthening exchange rate management and causing rising prices is an error in the policy of control. While Finance Minister Ketsujo is suppressing the budget, he is transporting cash on the other hand. How can such behavior be considered appropriate?</p>
<p>Finance Minister Ketsujo replied that strengthening exchange rate management and transporting cash will not cause mistakes, etc.</p>
<p>Next, Sakurai Heigo of the Minseito party raised questions about the current situation of the Manchurian-Soviet border issue.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied that the opinions of Japan and the Soviet Union are generally consistent on this matter, and there are two or three others. Negotiations are currently underway. After Foreign Vice Minister Horiuchi and Minister of Commerce Godo replied, Sakurai questioned China-Japan diplomacy, saying that after observing the course of Japan-China diplomacy to date, it cannot be said to be a diplomatic success no matter what. May I ask whether there are any shortcomings in the facilities for national contact and economic cooperation between Japan and China?</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hayashi replied that the various facilities for Japan-China cooperation cannot be considered perfect, and we are currently planning to conduct further concrete research.</p>
<p>Sakurai asked what the progress was in the negotiations regarding the incidents in the past year in which Japanese residents were brutally murdered by China for no reason.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Vice-Minister Horiuchi replied that negotiations have been continuing since March of last year, and the issues have been gradually resolved, but there are still two or three unresolved ones. Sakurai asked what his views were on the Three Principles towards China of the Hirota Cabinet. Foreign Minister Hayashi replied that I believe that in principle, it is extremely proper, but in practice, there are still some disagreements. Sakurai asked whether the biggest obstacle to Japan-China diplomacy is the feelings and misunderstandings of the people of the two countries. China calls Japan an invasionist, but I believe that the two countries originally could not proceed without co-existence and co-prosperity. May I ask whether there are any active plans to proceed from both cultural and economic perspectives?</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hayashi replied that if China considers Japan an invasionist, it is truly regrettable. As for the friendship between the two countries, my opinion is exactly the same as that of Mr. Sakurai.</p>
<p>Sakurai again questioned what the current cabinet's Southward Advance policy was.</p>
<p>Army Minister Hayashi replied that regarding the solution of immigration and raw material problems, without placing undue emphasis on the mainland, the policy of advancing southward should be fully considered. The meeting adjourned at 6:35 PM. (Allied Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<h3>Continued Record of the Japanese Intelligence Agency in Zhengzhou Conspiring to Harm Our Country</h3>
<p>Zhengzhou Dispatch: In early January of this year, the Zhengzhou Administrative Commissioner's Office cracked down on the Japanese intelligence agency stationed in Zhengzhou and seized various evidence of harming China, which has already been published in various newspapers. I have also learned that there are other documents that have been subsequently discovered and the dispatch book of the intelligence agency. Although they may be remnants and the text is incomplete, it is not difficult to find sufficient proof in the words of the intelligence agency's reconnaissance of military intelligence, the use of traitors, and the various activities of plotting to harm our country. Therefore, a more detailed record is given below.</p>
<p>㊀ Evidence of probing the contents of the Gongxian Arsenal: Delivered to the Garrison Headquarters, Gongxian Arsenal Investigation 11, 9, 22. (Investigation content omitted)</p>
<p>㊀ Plan to destroy northern Henan: On August 5th of last year, Wu Bainuo, who claimed to be the head of the northern Henan Autonomous Region, sent a letter to the Japanese Consulate in Zhengzhou requesting assistance to expand the autonomous army with 100,000 yuan, and to buy the Gongxian Arsenal with another 100,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>Guangdong Provincial Chamber of Commerce Strives for Taxation Standards for Business Tax</h3>
<p>Deliberations by Representatives of More Than Thirty Counties and Cities</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Because the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance modified the Business Tax Regulations, changing the taxable standard to business revenue, merchants throughout the province believe that it is difficult to implement. Previously, the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce repeatedly fought for it, but without result. On the side of the Department of Finance, the case has been decided and it is impossible to withdraw the order. Officials and the people each trended to extremes. Recently, the Department of Finance sent business tax assessors from various counties to various places to supervise and ensure that shops in various counties and cities report the amount of business tax for the purpose of taxation. Therefore, it has recently aroused opposition from the chambers of commerce in various counties and cities, and representatives have been sent to the province to convene a joint meeting of the provincial chambers of commerce to discuss response measures. Those who have arrived in the province in recent days include representatives from the Shantou City, Foshan City, Panyu, Heshan, Qujiang, Dongguan, Nanxiong, Chenghai, Qingyuan, Yangjiang, Gaozhao, Xingning, Huiyang, Zhongshan, Daliang, Chencun, Shiqiao, Zhongtang, and Dichai chambers of commerce. On the 16th, a general meeting of members of the provincial chamber of commerce was convened, and He Jiping, a representative of the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce, was elected as chairman. Representatives from various county and city chambers of commerce who attended included Li Zhongbiao, Tan Dichi, Feng Lvyu, and other thirty-nine people. During the meeting, the opposition to changing the business tax to be levied based on business revenue was discussed. The atmosphere was intense. It was unanimously resolved on the spot: 1. To designate Guo Xin and other twelve people to go to the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance, the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and the Provincial Government on the 17th to petition; 2. To submit a report to the Ministry of Finance strongly requesting the revocation of the new chapter on business tax; 3. To wire the Third Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, requesting that the Guangdong provincial business tax still be levied on the basis of capital amount; 4. To establish a Guangdong Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation Tax System Research Committee, immediately appointing representatives of the Lechang, Panyu, Gaozhao, Shantou, Nanxiong, Qingyuan, Dichai, Jiangmen counties and cities chambers of commerce and all executive and supervisory committee members of the Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation as members of the Tax System Research Committee, and stipulating the principles of the Tax System Committee as follows: A. Before this case is resolved, reporting should be temporarily suspended uniformly. B. Strive to avoid using business revenue as the taxable standard. C. When estimating the taxable standard and tax rate in the future, the government should be requested to allow the chambers of commerce in the relevant places to participate. D. After the tax amount is determined, the government should be asked to announce it. In the future, when there are donations and taxes, the tax amount should not be used as the standard for drawing taxes. E. Those who report business tax with copper notes should pay taxes according to copper notes. If silver dollars are levied, they should be converted into copper notes for calculation. After the above cases were passed, the meeting was adjourned. The twelve representatives who were nominated to go to various agencies to petition first went to the Department of Finance on the 17th to petition. Secretary Gui Jingqiu of the Department of Finance received them. The petition representatives strongly stated the difficulties of levying taxes based on business revenue and requested that taxes still be levied based on capital amount. Before this matter is resolved, they should be temporarily allowed to extend the reporting of tax amounts. Secretary Gui immediately replied: 1. Before this case is resolved, shops are allowed to extend the reporting of tax amounts; 2. Levying taxes according to the old chapter must wait for detailed consideration before a decision can be made. The representatives then withdrew and went to other agencies to petition. Each agency only sent people to accept the report, and there was no statement of opinion. Sent to the Guangdong Central Committee members in Nanjing's Third Plenary Session, and Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance. Stealing on the 16th of this month, our Chamber of Commerce convened representatives from various chambers of commerce and city to hold a meeting. The new chapter of business tax in Guangdong Province will change the industry that uses capital amount to levy tax to use business income amount to levy tax. After the announcement, businessmen and the people were shocked. According to the investigation, Guangdong merchants have always had small profits, which is different from other provinces. Business profits and losses are uncertain. If a transaction is carried out once, a good tax must be paid. After repeated extractions, the people can’t stand it. In terms of laws and regulations, there is room for variation. In fact, it is absolutely impossible. The most important thing in taxation in Guangdong is the unity of the overall situation. All celebrate to receive Su. How can we suffer the people again? It has been resolved to forward it to the file. It is reasonable to send an electrical report to the verification office, asking you to propose that the Guangdong provincial business tax should still be levied on the capital amount, and also asking the minister to order the Guangdong Finance Department to follow it. I can't wait for the order of Guangdong Provincial Chamber of Commerce Chairman He Jiping, Standing Committee Member Chuan Yizhi, He Jingqing, He Yaochu, and Liu Buxuan, Chen, (17), Seal, (February 17)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Burglary Case Cracked</p>
<p>After the Ben Cheng Dianye Bank was stolen of a huge amount of money on New Year's Eve, the county police authorities ordered a strict arrest in the case. Yesterday, someone holding the original thief-burnt banknotes stolen from the bank went to the Bank of China to exchange them. The bank knew that they were the original thieves from Dianye, and in addition to not exchanging them, they also notified Dianye Bank to report to the police station and send detectives to investigate. After investigation, it was determined that the exchanger was Jin Shiliang, who lived at No. 16, Xiuye Bridge North. The police station sent Inspector Yang to search his home, but found nothing. After interrogation, it was learned that the original thief's banknotes were hidden in Li Genquan's shop at the Xiechang Southern Goods Store on Huayang Bridge. Captain Yang went to the store at around 1 AM, called the door together with Town Chief Xu to search, and the store handed over Li Genquan and the original banknotes to the bureau for interrogation, saying that the ticket was indeed stolen from Dianye, but Li Genquan insisted that he had picked it up on the road.</p>

<p>Adultery Leads to Murder</p>
<p>Shen Youliang's wife, Shi Yuebao, a resident of the tenth household, section 3, Jiubao Township, Heqiao Township, second district of this county, continued to enjoy herself with her adulterer, Yang Zhongbo, a resident of Luduqiao, on the night of the 17th. She was caught by her husband, who gathered a crowd to catch the adulterer, tied up the adulterer Yang Zhongbo and beat him severely, threatening to kill him. When Shi saw this, she begged for forgiveness but was refused, so she returned to her room, took a knife, and committed suicide. Yang also suffered from freezing and severe beating, and his life was in danger. Yesterday, Hu Cheng, the reviewing officer, and the coroner separately inspected the remains for verification.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Electrical Perms</p>
<p>The Wuxian New Movement Promotion Association previously believed that electrical perms were harmful and unprofitable, and there were even cases of endangering life, so it was necessary to ban them. A document was sent to the Public Security Bureau for strict prohibition and investigation of a large number of perm equipment on file. However, after a long time, it was tolerated, and recently, various barbershops are still perming hair, and have come up with various new terms such as airplane style. Ordinary women do not know the pros and cons and flock to it. At the time of promoting the New Movement, it is necessary to strictly prohibit perms to avoid danger, so it has been decided to ask the Public Security Bureau to strictly prohibit them.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Hang Cao Section Opens to Traffic in July</p>
<p>The Hangcao Section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is progressing rapidly. Of the 77 bridges, large and small, along the line, except for the Cao'e River Bridge, which is a huge project, all two caissons have been installed and sunk, and the business can be completed within a month. Steel beams are delayed due to late ordering and must be shipped in May and installed in mid-June. In addition to completing the project by the end of September, the remaining 66 bridges will be completed by April 15, except for the steel beams that must arrive in Shanghai and be transferred to the site for erection on the 10th of next month. Other engineering and earthwork projects can be completed by mid-March. The steel rails of this section are being transported for application in March due to the exchange relationship with a part of the Shanghai-Hangzhou section, and are scheduled to be completed by the end of June. Traffic will open to Ningdu from July 1st, but before the Cao'e River Bridge is completed, passengers will still need to cross the river to change trains to maintain traffic.</p>

<h3>The True Meaning of National Salvation Through Unification by Liu Shi</h3>
<p>— Liu Shi</p>
<p>Except for those ambitious individuals and traitors who undermine unification, whom we must eliminate with force, we advocate that the forces of all social groups within the country should be concentrated to form a national united front to confront the current national enemy. Here, we urge everyone to abandon past grievances and to join hands and make peace with a calm and collected mind. Here, we proclaim that the survival of the nation outweighs everything else, even individual people or groups. Therefore, what China needs now is a unified nation capable of resisting enemy aggression and a national leader who can lead the nation to salvation. We oppose further political antagonism in China and oppose the expansion of internal divisions within Chinese society.</p>
<p>Therefore, China cannot have a so-called "People's Front" today. The anti-fascist People's Fronts in France and Spain today are not applicable to China, because the anti-fascist People's Fronts in France and Spain are frontlines formed from internal conflicts within France and Spain. Fascist rule in advanced capitalist countries poses a crisis of diminishing people's lives and property, so the people of France and Spain must rise up to oppose it. But China is different. Chinese society today does not have the foundation for this crisis. The current life-or-death issue for China today is not the crisis of fascist rule within the country, but the invasion of the national enemy and the nation's slide toward peril. This crisis not only harms the lower classes of Chinese people, but also Chinese national capitalists, and even financial capital. China currently does not face a crisis of fascist rule, and even fascist rule cannot be established, as the national enemy does not allow China to have an independent regime. Therefore, if someone today rashly advocates a "People's Front," mechanically imitating France and Spain, I would truly follow in the footsteps of Mr. Luo Meihuan and loudly shout "Down with the Chinese 'People's Front'!"</p>
<p>Does this mean that my opinion and Mr. Luo's are already consistent?</p>
<p>No! Although Mr. Luo is right to oppose the People's Front, he mistakenly believes that the National Front and the People's Front are the same thing and confuses the differences between the two! This mistake is truly a big one. I haven't had the opportunity like Mr. Luo to discuss the resolutions of the Third International and the "Communist Bandit Documents." I don't know what perspective they use to view the reality of China, but I discovered in Mr. Changjiang's "The Northwest Situation in Turmoil" (published in the Shanghai Ta Kung Pao on February 25th) that it is not the same as what Mr. Luo said. Although we cannot verify whose material is correct, comparing Mr. Luo's words with Mr. Changjiang's words clearly creates a contradiction. It is quite interesting. Of course, I don't need to pay much attention to this contradiction, because I am not a Communist, and I have no need to defend them. However, from my personal perspective, if the Third International and the Chinese Communist Party still oppose China's national salvation through unification today and want to use the "People's Front" to disperse national strength, then they have reached a dead end and have deviated from the Chinese people, and they are destined to perish sooner or later. Therefore, my personal feeling is that Mr. Changjiang's statement in "The Northwest Situation in Turmoil" regarding "the current transformation of the Communist Party" is more reasonable.</p>
<p>I am a non-partisan person, but I am also a "truly patriotic Chinese." I have a desire to save the nation, so I also have a national salvation proposal. For several years, my hope for peaceful unification to save China has been the same as that of many progressive individuals within the Party. When it comes to the grand strategy of national salvation, I have only written a few articles in magazines, which are mostly collected in the book "The Basic Understanding of National Salvation" cited by Mr. Luo. When I wrote those articles, it was precisely the time when many people were discussing the united front very enthusiastically. The words "united front" clearly explain the unity of the entire nation's strength, not a People's Front. In fact, the so-called national united front is just a clearer way of saying national salvation through unification, and the content is not different. When I said, "A united front is not about shortening the long to compensate for the short, eliminating all internal contradictions, but about uniting on one hand and struggling on the other hand..." I was not advocating a conspiracy, feigning compliance, but rather demanding that various social forces fully exert their respective strengths for national salvation under the premise of unification. Unifying national strength cannot be imagined as if the forces of various social groups will completely become equal in one day. I once jokingly said that there are tall people and short people here, and we must make the tall people take on the tasks of the tall people, and the short people must also have something to do, each exerting their own abilities. National salvation through unification means that we must not let go of a single ounce of strength within the nation and must mobilize all of it. During this unification process, because of the unevenness of social efforts and the unevenness of understanding, there will inevitably be slight differences in opinions regarding practical national salvation actions and strategies. A practical politician like Mr. Luo should not deny this fact. Then, in fact, we cannot deny the fact that there are relative contradictions between different social forces. There are still debates and struggles in practical actions, but these have a certain limit, which is that the struggle cannot hinder our unity. Now, standing from the Kuomintang's perspective, what I am saying is also reasonable. Today, the dominant social force in China is undoubtedly the Kuomintang. In a truly unified nation, the Kuomintang will naturally still have its own political views in every practical political action. It is not necessarily the case that it will agree with everything proposed by different political factions and individuals. Then, in the discussion of each practical issue, disputes are inevitable, which is a kind of struggle. Kuomintang members must strive to realize their own political propositions under the premise of unification; otherwise, they will fail in their duty as Kuomintang members. This is very easy to understand, so I also said, "People who generally misunderstand the united front think that since we are standing together, there is no need for any more struggles among our friends." This is entirely based on the facts. I dare not see unification as too beautiful or too abstract, making it mysterious, which would hinder the action of realizing unification.</p>

<h3>Shanghai St. John's Alumni Association Annual Meeting Unanimously Advocates Promoting the University's Registration</h3>
<p>President Bu Gives Speech... Next Session's Officers Elected</p>
<p>The Shanghai St. John's University Alumni Association held its annual banquet at Yipinxiang last night at 7:00 PM. Over two hundred people attended, including Liu Hongsheng, Li Denghui, Chen Shiqi, Yang Kuihou, Zhu Youyu, Zeng Lubai, Ma Chonglun, Wang Futao, Liu Qisheng, Cai Zhenghua, Cai Zhengya, Diao Xinde, Ding Wenbiao, Zhou Qibang, Shen Siliang, Jiang Shangfeng, Xu Naili, and others. A business meeting was held first, followed by formalities. Association President Yao Zengmo chaired the meeting, delivered a welcome speech, and reported on the association's activities over the past year. Accountant Yang Kuanlin reported on the financial situation. After the report, the chairman reported that members Song Minzhang, Liu Linsheng, Ma Chonggan, Shen Shouyu, and twelve others had submitted a "Proposal to Promote the University's Registration" (original text attached) for discussion. Luo Machonggan rose to explain the origin of the proposal, stating that the university authorities and the board of directors were actively proceeding with it. The Wuxi Alumni Association sent a letter requesting the university's registration and requesting the association's response. Today's proposal is to express the unanimous opinion of all Shanghai alumni, so that the school authorities can resolve difficulties and expedite registration. Next, Liu Hongsheng and others expressed their opinions. All raised their hands and unanimously passed the proposal. Then, the next session's officers were elected: Liu Jisheng was elected president, He Linyi was elected secretary, and Xuan Binggui was elected accountant. At 7:30 PM, a dinner was held, still chaired by Yao Zengmo. Huang Renzhi urged that attention be paid to economic issues in the National Exhibition. President Bu Fangji reported on the school's situation, such as the construction of new school buildings and the admission of female students. He also said that he will go to the United States on April 1st for an eight-month sabbatical, taking the opportunity to travel around the world, and hoped that St. John's alumni would unanimously support the university. School registration will be achieved in the shortest time, and the future of St. John's is limitless, and it will cultivate more talents to serve the Chinese nation, etc. Finally, the alumni association song was sung, and the meeting adjourned at 10:30 PM. Attached is the Proposal to Promote the University's Registration: (Reasons) It is found that in recent years, most schools run by domestic churches have complied with government regulations and applied for registration. It is indeed necessary to adjust the curriculum within the school and protect the students' future. There is no need to repeat this. However, our alma mater, St. John's University, has been slow to complete the registration procedures. Although the actual situation may be different from other schools, graduates and students cannot obtain proper qualifications, and their pain is increasing day by day. Moreover, the alma mater is a leading academic institution in the country, and its long-term isolation will gradually lag behind. The glorious history of fifty years will soon become unknown, which is particularly regrettable. It is faintly heard that the school's主管authorities also know that registration cannot be delayed and that the policy of isolation cannot be maintained for long. Only because there is no strong expression from outside the school, the obstacles in the environment cannot be removed. If all the alumni rise up and appeal together, the atmosphere in the school can be changed, and the registration procedures will be easier to enter. It is a matter of public welfare, and all alumni will surely agree. (Methods) After this case is passed at the Shanghai Alumni Association's annual meeting, the Shanghai Alumni Association will send a letter directly to the president of the alma mater, sincerely requesting him to expedite the registration procedures in order to comfort public opinion. Secondly, the Shanghai Alumni Association will notify alumni branches across the country to send letters to the president of the alma mater before the end of March of this year, stating that the matter of the alma mater's registration cannot be delayed any longer. In this way, with everyone working together, the matter of registration can be completed as early as possible. Whether the above-mentioned reasons and methods are appropriate, please decide publicly. Ma Detai, Shen Shouyu, Zhu Minzhang, Ding Guojian, Cen Dezhang, Ma Chonggan, Qian Xiangbiao, Liu Zisheng, Liu Linsheng, Zeng Lubai, Liu Fengsheng, and Liu Yunfang, together.</p>

<h3>Liu Hesheng to Sue over Liangxi's Assault and Insult of Referee Incident</h3>
<p>Related Parties Pay Attention to Discipline Issues, Will Make a Statement. The Iron City Cup Siege Dispute is Related.</p>
<p>Regarding the unfortunate incident in the Shanghai Park open basketball game the night before, where Liangxi team members from both the A and B groups assaulted and insulted the referee, Mr. Liu Hesheng, the referee at the time, immediately reported it to the Caojiadu Police Station, requesting the arrest and punishment of the main culprits Zhou Cheng, Wu Kesheng, and Cai Rongzhong. The details were briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that after questioning by the Caojiadu Police Station, the three main culprits, Zhou, Wu, and Cai, have been temporarily released on bail. However, Mr. Liu Hesheng, the insulted referee, in order to uphold discipline, is prepared to hire a lawyer to file a lawsuit against the assailants, in order to punish one as a warning to a hundred. In addition to filing a case with the Caojiadu Police Station, he also went to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for examination, which has confirmed that there are indeed multiple injuries. Furthermore, the Shanghai Basketball Committee, which is in charge of this competition, will also impose severe penalties according to the law to eliminate this scourge. It is noted that last year there was a dispute with the Pudong Middle School basketball team in Shanghai Park, and the group fight during the Iron City Cup the previous month, the instigators of which were closely related to the assailants the night before. It can be seen that in the pure sports world, only a few dregs commit such acts. Therefore, the YMCA also expressed yesterday that severe punishment is necessary to deter future offenders. Otherwise, future athletes will become even more domineering and arrogant, and the dignity of referees will be completely swept away. Therefore, in addition to the victim seeking legal solutions, all relevant parties are paying close attention to the issue of sportsmanship and discipline, in order to eliminate this unfortunate incident.

<h3>Toyota Mill Workers' Strike Caused Trouble, Resumed Work That Night After Persuasion</h3>
<p>Demolished Caojiadu Branch, Injured Tan Baoshou, Police Opened Fire to Suppress, Three Workers Injured</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that more than 3,000 workers from the new and old factories of the Japanese-owned Toyota Textile Mill at No. 200 Jessfield Road, Shanghai West, declared a strike yesterday morning because their representative, Sun Jiantai, was suddenly stabbed by thugs. They suspected that the mill's staff members, Shi Fulin and Shi Jingchun, had instigated the attack. The Caojiadu Police Station was also demolished, and the branch chief, Tan Baoshou, was injured. The police detachment used armed suppression to disperse the workers. Party and government agencies held a joint meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to decide on a solution. The workers accepted the persuasion and resumed work that night. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Strike Petition</p>
<p>Sun Jiantai, the representative of the Toyota Old Factory of the Shanghai West Japanese Mill Workers' Welfare Association, was suddenly stabbed by thugs at his home on the evening of the 18th of this month. Workers from the new and old factories were very angry upon hearing the news, suspecting that the mill's inspectors and translators, Shi Fulin and Shi Jingchun, had instigated the attack. At 6:00 AM yesterday morning, as day shift workers were going to work and night shift workers were leaving work, the workers from both factories suddenly declared a joint strike, surrounding Shi and Shi. Tan Baoshou, the chief of the Caojiadu Police Station, immediately led police officers to rescue Shi and Shi, taking them to the Zhongshan Road police station. About 2,000 striking workers gathered and followed them to the Caojiadu Branch to petition.</p>
<p>Demolish the Branch</p>
<p>The petitioning workers arrived at the Caojiadu Branch at 6:30 AM yesterday morning. Branch Chief Tan Baoshou had not yet returned from the Zhongshan Road police station. The striking workers rushed into the branch, completely destroying all office items inside, and injuring two police officers, Chen Rongqi and others, with wooden sticks. Just as Branch Chief Tan was returning to the branch in a car with Shi and Shi, the striking workers swarmed forward, beating Shi and Shi. Branch Chief Tan's head was also injured. Shi Fulin was dragged to the Welfare Association and beaten. Branch Chief Tan was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment after being injured, fortunately without serious injury. Shi Fulin was slightly injured, and Shi Jingchun took the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>Dispatch Police to Suppress</p>
<p>The Police Bureau immediately dispatched a large number of armed police officers and two armored vehicles to Caojiadu to suppress the workers and persuade them to disperse. However, the workers' attitude was firm, and they had to fire warning shots. Worker Zhu Xingli was shot in the leg, Zhang Wenlong and Zhou Tongru were shot in the foot, and Xu Licheng's head was hit by a wooden stick. By 9:00 AM, the petitioning workers were completely dispersed. By 10:00 AM, the branch had returned to its original state and resumed normal operations. Thirteen workers were arrested and sent to the Penglai Road headquarters. As for the injured workers, they were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. The list of arrested workers is as follows: Qu Hongnian, Liu Chunqi, Qin Qiaosheng, Chen Chunsheng, Chen Chunguo, Zhang Asan, Hu Shoukuan, Jiang Asi, Wu Jinsan, Gan Songlin, Wang Asan, Yang Yuanda, Yang Aer.</p>
<p>Party and Government Meeting</p>
<p>The City Social Bureau immediately dispatched Section 3 staff member Zhu Guilin to investigate upon receiving the report. The City Party Department also sent Civil Training Section staff members Li Weixiong to inspect. It is heard that the two have reported the situation to their superiors for verification. The City Party Department, the Social Bureau, the Police Bureau, and the General Labor Union held a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon at the City Party Department to discuss solutions. The attendees included the Secretary-General of the City Party Department Jiang Huaisu, the Director of the Civil Training Section Zhou Funong, staff members Lu Yinshu, Li Weixiong, Yu Yaoqiu, the Director of the Mediation Section of the Social Bureau Wang Xianqing, staff member Zhu Guilin, the Director of the Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Bureau Yang Jinghuan, the Chief Inspector Wang Weiming, and the Chairman of the General Labor Union Zhu Xuefan. Secretary-General Jiang chaired the meeting and reported on the Toyota Mill workers' strike petition, and then began to discuss and decide on solutions as follows: (1) The City Party Department, the Social Bureau, and the General Labor Union will persuade the workers to resume work first. (2) The demolition of the Caojiadu Branch and the beating of Branch Chief Tan and others will be investigated and severely punished according to the law. (3) The case of Sun Jiantai, the chief representative of the Toyota Mill of the Shanghai West Japanese Mill Workers' Welfare Association, being stabbed by thugs will be strictly pursued. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Persuade to Resume Work</p>
<p>After the meeting, the City Party Department sent staff members Lu Yinshu and Yu Yaoqiu, and the Social Bureau sent staff member Zhu Guilin, to the Toyota Mill to meet the Caojiadu Old Hot Spring Street No. 16 Welfare Association to convene representatives from the Toyota Mill to persuade them to resume work. More than 100 representatives from the new and old factories attended. After repeated persuasion by representatives from the Party and government agencies, the workers' representatives accepted the persuasion and agreed to return to work at 6:00 PM. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Approve Bail</p>
<p>The workers of the Toyota new and old factories accepted the persuasion of the Party and government agencies and returned to work successively at 6:00 PM yesterday evening. As for the thirteen arrested workers, it was decided to allow them to be released on bail after the workers resumed work. However, the bail procedures were not completed last night. The police bureau decided to severely punish the assailants after investigating the matter according to law. In order to prevent further incidents, the police bureau dispatched a large number of police officers to be stationed near the Toyota Mill and Caojiadu.</p>
<h3>Receiving the Press for the Paris Exposition</h3>
<p>Jade Artifact Preview Exhibition Established Yesterday</p>
<p>New News Agency reports: China's participation in the Paris Exposition held the inaugural meeting of the Jade Art Preview Exhibition at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday at 4:00 PM. News media and all members of the selection committee were invited, with over a hundred attendees, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Li Yuying, Pan Gongzhan (represented by Wu Hengru), and reporters from various newspapers. Chairman Lin Kanghou reported on the purpose of the meeting, Liu Xichang reported on the progress of preparations for participating in the Paris Exposition, and Zhang Wendi reported on the origins of organizing the Jade Art Preview Exhibition. Wu Hengru also gave a speech. The event concluded at 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Lin Kanghou reported, stating: Today, our country's Selection Committee for the Paris International Exposition is hosting the Shanghai news media and selection committee members. It is also the inaugural meeting of the Jade Art Preview Exhibition. We are grateful for everyone's presence. Since the beginning of the selection process, manufacturers have enthusiastically participated. All submissions will be subject to review by the review committee to determine whether they are qualified for selection. We plan to hold a preview exhibition in Shanghai for several hundred pieces of jade, among which the jadeite pagoda is the most precious. The pagoda took ten years of painstaking effort from planning and carving to completion, making its value known. The date of the preview exhibition is set for early March at the Husha (Lake Society). Tickets will be sold to help subsidize expenses. This participation in the Paris Exposition is entirely initiated by civilian groups. The expenses for going abroad are substantial. We hope that all sectors and members will support publicity, promote our country's culture and art, and win glory for our nation. The United States has scheduled a grand international exhibition for 1939 and has formally invited our country to participate. Therefore, we have specially organized the International Exposition Products Association (located on the fifth floor of the Pudong Building) to facilitate communication and assist the government in promoting national glory.</p>
<p>Preparatory Process</p>
<p>Next, Liu Xichang reported on the progress of preparations, stating: The Paris International Exposition will be held on May 1st this year, titled the Modern Literary and Technical International Exposition, including education, culture, art, industry, commerce, and economics. It will collect and exhibit emerging industries and cultural and educational undertakings from the last hundred years. The French government invited our country to participate the year before last. Our government politely declined due to special reasons. Subsequently, the French Association for International Cultural Cooperation and prominent figures from both countries with Franco-Chinese relations, as well as expatriates residing in France, recognizing the breadth of the exposition and the strong friendship and cultural cooperation between China and France, as well as the necessity of mutual support and cooperation in industry and technology, believed that participation in the exposition was of great significance and must be implemented. Letters and telegrams were exchanged, encouraging each other. Li Shizeng, Zhang Jingjiang, Wu Zhihui, Cai Yuanpei, Chu Minyi, and other gentlemen from the Chinese Association for International Cultural Cooperation initiated a gathering of Shanghai's leaders, including Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Qian Xinzhi, to discuss the matter at the World Society. It was decided that the Chinese Association for International Cultural Cooperation, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and the Bankers' Association would jointly organize the "China Participation in the Paris International Exposition Association." Chu Minyi, Zhao Zhiyou, Liu Fucheng, Xie Dongfa, and Liu Xichang were elected as representatives. After the establishment of the office, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan for record and notified the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Education, Railways, Communications, Industry, and Finance for assistance. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also instructed the Embassy in France to notify the French government and the General Office of the Exposition. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with the French Ambassador to China, Naziya, and submitted the list of representatives to the French government. This is the process of our Association's initiation to participate in the Paris Exposition. As for the work of our delegation and the recent level of preparation, there is also something to be said, which I will explain separately. The task of our delegation is to participate in the Paris Exposition. The first step, of course, should be to collect entries for the competition. The entries are divided into three major categories: culture, education, industry, commerce, and art. The culture and education section is requisitioned by the Ministry of Education through notices to the Provincial Departments of Education, the Municipal Bureaus of Education, secondary schools and above, vocational schools, and cultural institutions and scientific organizations throughout the country. The industry and commerce section is requisitioned by separately inviting leaders from the industrial and commercial sectors to organize a selection committee. The selection committee consists of more than eighty members, all well-known figures, who are working hard to solicit entries. Therefore, entries from various industries are exceptionally enthusiastic. The art section is requisitioned by Xu Shiqi of the National Art Association in Beijing and by Ye Gongchuo and Li Zuhan in Shanghai. Currently, industrial, commercial, educational, and art entries have been successively sent to our Association, and a collection point has been set up in the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Commodity Exhibition Hall to facilitate all sectors. At the same time, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau and the International Trade Bureau are also assisting in collecting various export trade commodities. In addition, special products from provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Hebei, and Shandong, as well as fine products from nearby areas such as Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Yangzhou, are either collected by special commissioners or requisitioned by local chambers of commerce on behalf of us. Fortunately, all sectors understand the important significance of participating in the exposition and are enthusiastically responding to the call. In summary, all cultural, educational, industrial, commercial, and artistic items of national value are being collected as much as possible in order to enrich and perfect the exhibition in France, to promote our national glory. As for the French side, Representative Liu Fucheng has gone to arrange everything. At present, the number of entries received by the office of our delegation is already considerable, and the entries that have been identified are being rushed. They can be sent to the association successively in the coming days. Once the collection is complete, this office will convene a review committee to carry out the review. At the same time, the collection of items will be stopped, and the items will be packed into boxes successively after March 10th, and shipped to France by French cargo ship on March 20th. Because the exposition is scheduled to open on May 1st, time is pressing, and we have to step up our work. Among the various solicited entries, the jade industry's products are the most exquisite, including jadeite pagodas and various jade art products, with a value of millions of dollars. Therefore, our Association is holding a preview exhibition in Shanghai to allow the people of Shanghai to see them first. Today, we have not been thorough in entertaining all sectors. Please forgive us.</p>
<p>Origins of the Preview</p>
<p>Next, Zhang Wendi reported on the origins of organizing the Jade Art Preview Exhibition, stating: The purpose of participating in the expositions of various countries is not only to promote national glory, but also to have a significant impact on international trade. Therefore, the submitted entries must be carefully selected. Jade carving can be said to be a unique cultural art of our country. Each carving requires artists with more than ten years of experience to attempt. Jadeite carving is the most difficult. This time, we have been invited by the gentlemen of the Selection Committee for China's participation in the Paris Exposition to send precious jadeite pagodas and other jade artifacts abroad to participate. For the sake of promoting our country's art, we should do our best. It has now been decided to transport the jadeite pagoda to participate. The pagoda once participated in the Chicago Exposition and caused a sensation. However, there are many people in the country who have not seen this precious item. Now, it has been decided to hold a preview exhibition in Shanghai for all sectors to appreciate it.</p>
<p>Representative's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, represented Wu Hengru in giving a speech, stating: Director Pan is in Beijing on official business and instructed me to attend on his behalf. I would like to take this opportunity to report to you that Chairman Chiang of the National Economic Commission advocates the promotion of domestic handicrafts. Our country's handicrafts are indeed valuable. In the future, they can not only meet domestic needs but also promote foreign trade. Therefore, a national handicrafts exhibition will be held in Beijing from May 1st to May 31st. This move has a great relationship with promoting our country's inherent handicrafts and foreign trade. Its significance is the same as participating in international expositions. As for the solicitation of items, the Social Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce have been entrusted to handle it. The collection has already begun, and the deadline is the end of March. The items will be transported to Beijing for exhibition in early April. It is hoped that all handicraft producers will enthusiastically participate. Furthermore, our municipal government will celebrate its tenth anniversary in July and plans to hold a handicrafts exhibition and sports meet at that time. All handicraft products participating in Beijing will be transported to Shanghai for exhibition.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Grand Theatre Destroyed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Due to the screening of the film "Abyssinia," it was destroyed yesterday by Italian sailors and expatriates</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Grand Theatre, located at the intersection of North Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road in the Extra-Settlement Road Area, No. 523, is run by Soviet merchants and often screens Soviet films. The "Abyssinia" film, produced by the Soviet Film News Factory and managed by the Asian Film Company, was destroyed by Italian sailors and expatriates in Shanghai. The losses are currently being negotiated by various parties. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Resubmitted for Inspection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Grand Theatre is located at No. 523, at the intersection of North Fourth Road and Qiujiang Road in the Extra-Settlement Road Area and is operated by Soviet expatriates. It often screens Soviet-produced films. The "Abyssinia" film was produced by the Soviet Film News Factory. When the film arrived in Shanghai last year, it was submitted to the Central Film Censorship Committee for inspection and approval. The theater scheduled a premiere of January 21st, then the Italian Embassy lodged a protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the screening be stopped. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a letter to the municipal government, ordering the responsible police station to prohibit the screening. The theater stopped screening it after only one day. The Central Film Censorship Committee also ordered the theater to resubmit the film for inspection. The theater complied and resubmitted the film to the Central Film Censorship Committee. Only the day before yesterday did it pass and get returned.</p>
<p>Screening Permitted</p>
<p>After the theater resubmitted the film for inspection, it published an advertisement to reschedule it for screening yesterday. Chen Zekuan, the head of the North Sichuan Road Police Station, saw the advertisement. Fearing that there would be trouble and not having received a formal written order, he still ordered the theater to prohibit the screening. The theater had obtained permission for rescreening from the Central Film Censorship Committee and had already published advertisements, making it difficult to stop. Director Chen reported the matter to Secretary-General Yu of the municipal government. Yu then sought instructions from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. At the same time, the theater also requested the Central Film Censorship Committee to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to telegraph the Shanghai municipal government to cancel the ban. The Central Film Censorship Committee believed that the film had been re-examined and that its content no longer offended the country and should be allowed to be screened. Therefore, it granted the request. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs also telegraphed the municipal government to cancel the ban. The municipal government then ordered Director Chen to allow the film to be screened for two days.</p>
<p>Incident Occurs</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the film's rescreening. There were six screenings scheduled for 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM, 5:15 PM, 7:15 PM, and 9:15 PM. The first two screenings went smoothly without incident. During the third screening, dozens of Italian sailors in uniform (with "Lepanto" on their caps) and dozens of expatriates were in the stalls and balcony area. No one expected that an incident was about to occur.</p>
<p>The Course of Events</p>
<p>As soon as the newsreel ended and the main feature started, when the Abyssinian people swore an oath to join the army to resist the enemy, the entire audience applauded, expressing their sympathy. Suddenly, an Italian sitting in the balcony stood up and shouted slogans. Then, Italian sailors and expatriates sitting nearby all stood up and rushed towards the projection booth. At the same time, some Italian sailors and expatriates used pre-hidden wooden sticks to beat people indiscriminately and threw bottles of ammonia and nitric acid into the theater. The theater became chaotic. At the same time, argon gas filled the air, and the smell was foul. However, because the projection booth had been locked in advance and obstacles were piled up at the door, it was not easy to break through for a while. Finally, because of the large number of people and some holding weapons, the door was destroyed. The Italian sailors swarmed in, and all the machines were destroyed. The entire "Abyssinia" film was taken away. Other films stored in the projection booth were destroyed by nitric acid. At the same time, the theater's electrical technician, Abramovich (of Soviet Russian nationality), suffered a serious injury to his left arm. A Chinese technician named Ma Yaohua was also slightly injured.</p>
<p>Losses</p>
<p>While the theater was in turmoil, another hundred or so Italian sailors and expatriates outside the theater, led by someone resembling a military officer, also swarmed into the main entrance, completely destroying the large glass windows, ticket doors, electric light billboards, and various glass photographs. At this time, the audience was extremely panicked due to the extremely chaotic internal situation and the large number of people rushing in from the outside. They scrambled to escape. The situation was extremely pitiful. The Italian sailors and expatriates, seeing that their goal had been achieved, left the main entrance and boarded the prepared cars and left.</p>
<p>Police Station Report</p>
<p>Before the incident occurred, the North Sichuan Road Police Station had dispatched a police sergeant and three police officers to guard the entrance. After the incident occurred, the theater authorities immediately notified Director Chen Zekuan of the station. At the same time, the police sergeant stationed at the theater also rushed back to the station to report. After receiving the report, Director Chen led more than twenty police officers to the theater. However, the Italian soldiers and civilians had already fled and could not be arrested. Director Chen dispatched a few police officers to guard the theater and immediately returned to the station to report to his superiors.</p>
<p>Request for Negotiation</p>
<p>After the fact, the Central News Agency reporter inquired at the theater. According to the person in charge of the theater, the destruction of this theater seemed to be a planned action. It was witnessed that the Italian Vice Consul, Commercial Counselor, and military officers were also present. When the riot occurred, they destroyed the items as much as possible and shouted slogans and sang songs. It is still difficult to estimate the extent of the losses, but the Soviet Russian Consulate has been informed to request the Chinese government to seriously negotiate with the Italian Consulate.</p>
<p>Chen Zekuan's Statement</p>
<p>North Sichuan Road Police Station Director Chen Zekuan told the Central News Agency reporter that this unfortunate incident occurred. It was his duty, and although he had handled it carefully in advance, seeing that the more stimulating parts had been completely deleted, even if Italians went, it was thought that accidents would not occur. Unexpectedly, it exceeded expectations. After receiving the report, he rushed to the scene of the incident. Although it was nearby, by the time he arrived, all the rioters had completely retreated. Otherwise, they would have been arrested and dealt with according to law. He is reporting the circumstances to his superiors for handling.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Continues to Study Income Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce studies income tax regulations, answers questions from various industries, and opens classes to teach various sections. The following is a continuation of the report.</p>
<p>Soliciting Opinions</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the Construction Industry Association, the Architectural Association, the Chinese Institute of Engineers, the Shipping Industry, the Inland River Shipping Industry, and the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association, stating: "The Provisional Regulations on Income Tax have been promulgated and implemented. The draft collection guidelines for various types of income tax have also been drafted separately and are being submitted to the ministry for approval. We are now investigating the draft collection guidelines for the first type of profit-seeking enterprise income tax. In the asset valuation method, the depreciation calculation table lists various buildings, decoration equipment, ships, machinery, tools, and equipment. It is estimated that the standard useful life is based on the nature of its structure. Whether the estimated useful life is accurate and uniform, and whether the highest and lowest limits should be added, seems to be of research value. In addition to separate letters, a copy of the original depreciation rate calculation table is enclosed for reference. Please check and study the useful life of various buildings, chimneys, decoration and ancillary equipment, ship machinery, tools, and equipment. Please send your opinions back to the Association by the 28th of this year for review and discussion."</p>
<p>Answering Doubts</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce transferred the two doubts raised by the Machinery Dyeing Industry Association to Accountant Xu Yongzuo for answers as follows: ㊀Workers' savings deposits, which are deposited in accordance with special laws, can be exempted from income tax in accordance with the tax exemption regulations of Article 2, Paragraph 3, Item 3 of the Provisional Regulations. Those who do not meet this condition should all be subject to income tax withheld by the interest-paying agency in accordance with the current interpretation of the regulations. ㊁The remuneration income of brokers should fall within the scope of salaries and remuneration, and if there is a fixed paying agency, the income tax should be withheld by the respective factories. However, because the payment amount and payment period are generally not fixed, it has not yet been determined how to handle the withholding procedures. There are probably two methods: one method is to see whether the amount paid each time exceeds 30 yuan. If it exceeds 30 yuan, the income tax should be withheld at any time. The other method is to calculate the income tax that should be withheld for each month based on its cumulative number at the end of each month, regardless of the amount paid each time.</p>

<h3>Short's Mother Hopes to Come to China</h3>
<p>To visit her son's grave</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that during the January 28 Incident in Shanghai in previous years, American youth aviator Mr. Short bravely fought Japanese aircraft in the sky over Suzhou and unfortunately died in action. His remains are buried at Hongqiao Airport. Sunday (the 22nd) marked the fifth anniversary of his death. The Shanghai municipal government and representatives of local organizations and friends of Mr. Short plan to go to his tomb at 2:00 PM on that day to present wreaths and pay their respects. Not long after Mr. Short's death, his mother came to China once.

She hopes that the Chinese government will soon prepare travel expenses for her to come to China again to visit her son's grave.</p>
<h3>Former Spanish Commercial Officer in Shanghai, Sanji, Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Feileier is illegal</p>
<p>New Sound News Agency reports that Feileier, the former Spanish Consul-General in Hong Kong, who resigned to the Madrid government, has now been ordered by the country's National Army government to resume his consular powers. Wei Shengqu, the former secretary of the country's Consulate, still supports its current government and therefore came forward to oppose Feileier. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Sanji, the former Spanish Commercial Commissioner in Shanghai, has also come out in opposition and issued a statement yesterday. The gist of the translation is as follows: "Regarding the issue of Spanish consular jurisdiction, it must now wait for the decision of the Chinese government. Feileier is a false consul. I am now challenging him. Even if he recognizes that I am attacking his consular court, he cannot arrest me. Although I do not want to commit a crime, if I accidentally violate the traffic regulations when driving out one day, I am not afraid of the police station reporting Feileier's fine on me. Today (ie, yesterday), the newspaper (referring to a foreign newspaper) published Feileier's conversation, saying that on January 22, the traffic section of the patrol room submitted a case concerning a Spaniard to him. In this regard, I will send a letter to the Public Concession Bureau to demand the immediate cessation of such illegal steps. Feileier illegally issues entry permits, and he himself has committed a crime. Although the patrol room has verified the evidence, it has not been able to arrest him. Feileier must know that the entry permits he issued are not recognized by the local authorities and are completely invalid. At present, I only hope that the Spanish government (referring to the Madrid government) will soon have a legal representative stationed in Shanghai, so that Feileier's various illegal acts can be stopped." There is a person named Gao En who intends to go to the United States. He obtained an entry permit issued by Feileier before Feileier resigned. Now, because the certificate has been issued for a long time, he fears that it will expire. He went to Feileier's office again a few days ago to ask him to add a note and took it to the US Consulate for verification. Unexpectedly, it backfired and was rejected by the US Consulate. The United States does not recognize the Spanish National Army government and cannot recognize Feileier, who has resigned, as the Spanish Consul in Shanghai. Therefore, the entry permit was rejected and invalidated due to Feileier's endorsement.</p>
<h3>Anhui Construction Director Liu Yiyan's Mission in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Negotiating Loans with the Bank of Communications</p>
<p>Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, came to Shanghai from Anqing the day before yesterday and is staying at the Cangzhou Hotel. The Times reporter visited him yesterday to inquire about his mission in Shanghai. According to him, this trip to Shanghai is to negotiate a loan with the Bank of Communications. The total amount of the loan is 2.5 million yuan. Since the province implemented the unified sales of black tea last year, the results have been quite good. However, the loans to tea farmers are currently being lent by the provincial government at low interest rates so that farmers can fully develop production. This year, Anhui tea farmers are in the cultivation period, so the demand for loans is very high. The Bank of Communications has made huge loans to Anhui Province for many years and has been very helpful in developing black tea. This loan of 2.5 million yuan has been negotiated and will be used for Qihong loans in principle, guaranteed by the provincial government. As for interest and mortgages, they are the same as in the past.</p>

<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, regarding the labor dispute at the Gongyi Cotton Mill at 150 Route Robert, West Shanghai, after the workers presented six demands the day before yesterday, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhang Chuqiang to the factory before 10:00 AM yesterday to hear the factory's response. As a result, the factory's response to the workers' demands was as follows: ㊀ Lu Fusheng and the other seven foremen will be given four months of severance pay after all the workers in each department have fully resumed work. As for pension, it will be paid after six months. ㊁ The reinstatement of the dismissed workers cannot be accepted. ㊂ The factory is willing to give 14 male yarn-winding workers two months of severance pay each, six yuan each for child workers in the bobbin room, and five yuan each for child workers in the fine yarn and yarn-winding rooms. ㊃ Workers will never be dismissed without reason. ㊄ The abolition of the contracting system and the abolition of new staff cannot be accepted. ㊅ Wages during the strike period cannot be paid.

<h3>80th Anniversary of the North German Lloyd Shipping Company</h3>
<p>The North German Lloyd Shipping Company, managed by Melchers &amp; Co. in this port, celebrated its 80th anniversary yesterday. Celebrations were held in various cities around the world with German consulates. According to records, the company was founded in February 1857 by the consular officer Lale, with only three small transport ships traveling between England and Germany. The following year, a ship of about 2,500 tons, named the "Bremen," crossed the Atlantic from Bremen to New York. Since then, it has gradually expanded. By 1924, when the European War broke out, the total tonnage of its ships had reached 982,951 tons. Its ships traveled across all oceans, making it one of the world's leading shipping companies. After the end of the European War, it was reduced to 57,671 tons. Once the overall situation was stabilized, it revitalized its business. As of today, it has about 600,000 tons again. From 1935 to 1936, it launched the Far East Express service with three famous ships, each with a load of 18,000 tons. One of its largest three mail ships operating on the Atlantic route, named "Bremen," has a load of over 51,731 tons. It is expected that it will gradually expand in the future and soon restore its former position.</p>

<h3>The Two Railway Administrations Instruct All Departments to Pay Attention to Division of Labor and Cooperation</h3>
<p>Rotating Daily to Hold Consultation Meetings</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Administrations previously formed a railway administration inspection team to inspect the two railways in order to improve railway administration. According to the inspection team's report, the personnel in charge of the carriage, machinery, and police affairs at the major stations lacked communication, so although there was division of labor, there was no cooperation, which greatly affected the railway administration facilities. In order to remedy this situation, all departments are specially ordered to designate several major stations and instruct the leading or senior personnel in charge of the carriage, workshop, machinery, and police affairs departments at each station to convene a discussion meeting once a month on a rotating basis to exchange opinions on station affairs. If the station has personnel in charge of materials and health care, they can also participate. If important accidents occur temporarily, temporary discussion meetings can also be convened for consultation. Once a solution is agreed upon, each person in charge will be responsible for implementing it within their scope. The procedures must be simple and agile. Upon receiving the instructions, all departments will designate personnel to be responsible for handling the matter.</p>
<h3>10th Anniversary Celebration of the Marine Engineers Association</h3>

Failure to report by the deadline will be treated as concealment in accordance with the regulations. Please do not delay. The contents of the notices are as follows: Notice urging payment of income tax on salaries and remuneration: "We have found that your □ month salary and remuneration income tax, which should have been withheld, has not yet been reported and paid.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Announcement Prohibiting Impersonation of Officials to Search for Opium and Drugs</h3>
<p>Police Officers Must Present Identification When Searching; Harassment and Extortion Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, in order to crack down on anonymous accusations of opium and drug cases, framing innocent people, or impersonating officials to search and extort property, issued Announcement No. 6 yesterday, prohibiting such actions. (Omitted above) "Although this bureau is not a judicial organ for opium and drug cases, it is responsible for investigating and cracking down on opium and drug cases. (Omitted in the middle) However, after investigating, we have found that Shanghai is a place where people from all walks of life live, and there is a mix of good and bad. It is difficult to guarantee that there will be no unscrupulous people who anonymously accuse and frame innocent people, or impersonate officials of this bureau, falsely claiming to search and extort property. If we do not strictly prevent and control this, how can we eliminate the bad and protect the good? Now, the following measures are stipulated: From the date of this announcement, all personnel of this bureau who are ordered to investigate and crack down on opium and drug cases must carry the identification card issued by this bureau. Police officers must wear badges to prove their identity. After the inspection is completed, the police officers must fill out an inspection certificate and submit it to the bureau for record. If there is no such proof, the residents being inspected have the right to refuse the search. If they can identify that the car belongs to an impersonator, they are allowed to arrest them and send them to the bureau for interrogation and severe punishment. If police officers engage in procedures that do not comply with regulations or engage in harassment and extortion during the execution of the search, they should immediately report to the bureau in accordance with the law. Once verified, they will be severely punished. As for anonymous complaints, this bureau will conduct a thorough investigation and search only after having credible evidence. If it is found that the complaint is based on a grudge, we will pursue the matter and bring them to justice. We will never tolerate such behavior. (Omitted below)"</p>
<h3>Central Cold Storage Plant Auctioned Due to Poor Market and Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Selling Price: 25,300 Yuan; Yan Ziyu Has Declared Bankruptcy</p>
<p>The Central Cold Storage Plant at 619 East Broadway Road, Hongkou, was jointly established by Ningbo natives Yan Ziyu and Yu Wenhao. It has been in operation for seven years, specializing in the export of egg yolk and egg white and the production of water. The business was very large. During its peak years, it made a profit of more than 2 million in two years. As a result, two branch factories were established in places such as the Dixiwei Road. Yan went to Europe and the United States to conduct inspections in the past year, spending 7,500 British pounds. After returning to China, he made major reforms. Unexpectedly, in the past two years, the company has suffered heavy losses due to the impact of the global economic downturn and poor market conditions, with debts reaching 1 million. Unable to pay the debts, the creditors filed lawsuits with the First Special Court one after another, and the factory was subsequently sealed up. At that time, Yan still wanted to struggle and tried to reopen the factory, but the creditors could not agree. On the 16th (sixteenth) of the past, the Special Court implemented the auction. The lawyer Fei Si represented the purchase, with a selling price of 25,300 yuan. It is currently being dismantled, and the factory will be completely eliminated. Hundreds of male and female workers and staff members have been reported to have lost their jobs. Yan has also been accused of being wanted by Xu Weiji. He was arrested and detained in the Special Court's detention center a few days ago. The creditors have filed lawsuits and chased after him. Now Yan Ziyu has declared bankruptcy, and the Special Court has appointed accountant Li Ding as the bankruptcy administrator.</p>

All rickshaw owners have registered their rickshaw owner certificates with the association, and the association has submitted them to the Shanghai Municipal Council for verification. At the same time, the association decided to send representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau, the Mutual Aid Association, and the Shanghai Municipal Council on Monday morning to petition on the issue of rickshaw puller education fees, arguing that rickshaw owners cannot afford to bear the expense. If they want to start rickshaw puller education, the Mutual Aid Association can allocate funds based on the number of rickshaws.</p>

<h3>Mastermind of the Jingyun Building Robbery Case Apprehended in Pudong</h3>
<p>Zhu Xisheng Admits to Group Robbery; Most of the Others Do Not Admit</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM on December 21 of last year, several fierce robbers suddenly came to the accounting office of the Nanzun businessman Liu Jingde Tang, located at Room 508, Jingyun Building, 378 Beijing Road, under the guise of renting a house. They opened the silver boxes inside and outside and searched for loot, obtaining more than 4,500 yuan in total. They fled with the money. At that time, the tea boy Wen A-kun took the opportunity to slip out and reported to the gatekeeper Pan Shoulong, who called for help outside. A Chinese and a Western detective from the Central Police Department were dispatched to arrest them. The two sides fought fiercely. As a result, the Western detective and the gatekeeper both died in the line of duty. One of the robbers was also killed while fleeing. After the incident, the Central Police Department exhausted its efforts for several days and successively apprehended more than ten suspects in places such as the South Wharf in Pudong, a certain hotel on Wuma Road in the Public Concession, Xiaopi Lane in Nanshi, and West Baoxing Road in Zhabei, and sent them to the First Special Court for separate trials. It is now learned that Wang Shifu, the captain of the Detective Squad of the Pudong Police Sub-Bureau, learned that</p>
<p>The mastermind of the case</p>
<p>Zhu Xisheng, was hiding in the Xiaonan Wharf area of Pudong. He immediately dispatched detectives Li Guisheng and Jiang Binru to rush to the area at 10:45 PM the day before yesterday. Using swift means, they arrested Zhu and brought him to the team. According to his confession, he is 35 years old, a local, a doctor, and lives at 77 Zhoujia Lane, Tangqiao, Pudong. He admitted that he had participated in the robbery of Jingyun Building at the end of last year and also confessed that in February of last year (lunar calendar), at about 10:00 PM on a certain night, he held a gun and robbed a family surnamed Xu in Tangqiao, Pudong, of a pair of gold earrings and 5 yuan in legal tender, together with accomplices Yao Zhoukang and Zhang Jian, who were hiding in Room 22, Daxin Hotel, Hubei Road, Public Concession. The bureau then dispatched detectives Liu Changrui, Liu Hanxia, Cui Youkuan, Wu Tao, and Zhang Hongxiang to rush to the hotel at 2:00 AM yesterday to conduct a search but found nothing.</p>
<p>Only Dai Quanqing was arrested in the room. According to his confession, he is 36 years old, a local, and lives at 128 Qigan Bridge, Zhoujiadu, Pudong. He works at Jia Fook Kee Transport. He said, "Room 22 is my room. Kang Zhangjian came to visit yesterday afternoon and hung his coat on the hanger and left. I don't know that they are robbers." The detectives then went to the residence of Yao Zhouzhou at 51 Beishou, Liuli Bridge, Pudong, and arrested Yao and brought him to the team. He confessed that he is 31 years old, sells vegetables. In the first half of last year, I, Zhu Xisheng, and two people from Jiangbei broke into a family surnamed Xu in Tangqiao and robbed them of a gold earring, three sets of Xiangyunsha shirts and trousers, 5 yuan in legal tender, and 300 copper coins. Also, at the end of the year before last, they robbed a family surnamed in Bailianjing, Pudong, of dozens of yuan. Also, in the summer of last year, Kang Zhangjian and Lao Yang and others sent letters to extort 150 yuan in legal tender from the manager of a foreign firm in Tiantong Temple, Zhabei. I received 10 yuan. Regarding the Jingyun Building robbery case,</p>
<p>I did not participate.</p>
<p>The original patrol team continued to apprehend the suspect Cai Jianquan at the Pudong South Wharf Ferry at 9:00 AM yesterday. According to his confession, he is 39 years old, a local, and lives at 8 Yangjia House, South Wharf. He sells vegetables. He did not know anything about the Jingyun Building robbery case. However, he knew Yao Zhouzhou. Yao once said that Kang Zhangjian often visited the Daxin Hotel. He and Zhu Xisheng did not do good things, but he did not know the details. After verifying the confession, the team handed over all the criminals to the Detective Brigade of the Municipal Police Bureau for interrogation yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Anton Road Area Construction Laborers Petitioned Mr. Yu Yesterday</h3>
<p>Requesting the Municipal Council to Return Their Licenses</p>
<p>More than one hundred temporary road construction laborers, including Kuai Jiade, from the Anton Road area in Eastern Shanghai, jointly submitted a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday, which read, "We, more than three hundred temporary road construction workers, formerly employed by the Anton Road Works Department, held temporary road worker licenses. Whenever there was a heavy workload, we temporary workers supplemented the work. For the past five or six years, we have diligently performed our duties. Unexpectedly, in December of last year, the Works Department announced a reduction in spending and layoffs. The labor foreman in this area, Zhang Amao (formerly a drainage ditch foreman in the Sanitation Department), preemptively collected our temporary worker licenses and laid us all off, causing us to lose our jobs. At that time, we intended to make a request immediately, but considering that long-term workers were also being laid off at the same time, we felt it was reasonable to address the long-term worker issue first. Now, seeing reports in the newspapers of the 18th of this month stating that your Council declared, 'This Council has not discussed reducing road workers to this day,' the workers, after reading this, realized that the so-called reduction in road workers was purely a trick played by the foreman. We dare not blindly assume his intentions, but he used the excuse of reduced spending to collect all of our temporary worker licenses and hire drainage ditch workers to fill our positions, which clearly shows that he has other plans. It is evident that Zhang Amao fabricated rumors, damaging the reputation of your Council, which is unforgivable. Therefore, we earnestly request your review and approval to return the temporary licenses that were unjustly taken back by the foreman, in order to maintain the livelihood of the laborers, which would be a virtuous act. "Yesterday at 2:00 PM, Kuai Jiade, Liu Demao, Mao Yude, and others were appointed as representatives to petition Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a Chinese Director, requesting the restoration of temporary work to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>French Police, Fully Armed, Arrested Thieves; Wealthy Merchant Fled in Panic and Was Injured</h3>
<p>Surrounding Residence Based on Thief's Confession; Search Found No Trace of Thieves</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department recently apprehended several thieves who were sent to the Special Second Court for interrogation and investigation. Based on the confession of these thieves that accomplices were hiding in a house near the Slaughterhouse Company, the French Police Special Unit, fully armed, led by Chinese and Western constables, along with the captured thieves, rushed to surround and arrest them yesterday morning around 7:00 AM. Unexpectedly, the location turned out to be the residence of a wealthy merchant named Jin. The servants in the house, suspecting a robbery, were extremely frightened and shouted loudly. Mr. Jin, the owner of the house, woke up upon hearing the alarm, opened the window to look out, and saw many people outside holding guns. In a moment of panic, he climbed onto the drying platform, intending to jump into the neighboring house to escape. However, in his panic and confusion, he lost his footing and fell from a height, causing severe head and body injuries. After searching, the detectives found no trace of the thieves. They then took the injured Mr. Jin to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Police Station Added Police Officers</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, the North Railway Station Police Sub-bureau and the Xin Zha Police Sub-bureau, due to the incident of workers from a Japanese-owned cotton mill in Western Shanghai destroying the Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau, feared that the large number of workers would cause further trouble. To prevent such a situation from occurring, they were ordered by the Supervisory Office of the Police Headquarters to not only transfer a number of officers and patrolmen from each sub-bureau in shifts for protection, but also to transfer ten officers from each police precinct to the sub-bureau for rotational protection until the evening, which had not been lifted. Therefore, no incidents occurred at any of the sub-bureaus yesterday. In addition, the Public Concession Police Authority, also because of this incident, deployed Chinese and Western constables to guard the border between the Chinese and Public Concessions in the Zhabei-Western Shanghai area yesterday morning to prevent the workers from entering.</p>
<h3>The Second Special District Court Burned Narcotics</h3>
<p>Gambling Equipment and Contraband Were Destroyed in One Fell Swoop</p>
<p>The Second Special District Court of the French Concession has a standard practice of publicly burning confiscated opium, narcotics, and contraband submitted by the patrol room every three months. From July to the end of December last year, the confiscated items were not numerous, so two sessions were combined into one. The nineteenth burning was scheduled for yesterday afternoon. Court President Wang Simo and Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang first reported to their superiors and sent letters to various agencies, inviting representatives to supervise the proceedings. As reported in this newspaper, representatives from the Judicial Administration Department, Chief Prosecutor Yue of the Second Branch Court, and representatives from military, government, police, legal, and commercial agencies arrived one after another yesterday afternoon. President Wang and Chief Prosecutor Sun then ordered the head of the exhibit warehouse to have the laborers on site carry the items to the front of the representatives for inspection, sealing, and weighing before piling them in the courtyard and setting them on fire. After the narcotics were burned, gambling equipment and contraband were burned until the process concluded at 4:00 PM. This session destroyed opium and other items, including 126 sets of opium pipes, 32 opium bowls, 17 pounds, 41 taels, 4 qian, and 9 fen, plus 81 small packets of opium, 548 opium bubbles, plus 3 qian and 4 fen, 29 small boxes and 7 small packets of opium paste, 1 small bottle, 7 jin and 4 pounds of opium residue, 30 pounds and 6 small packets of opium ash, 1 small vat, 92 pounds plus 41,198 red pills, 67 pounds plus 1 package and 1 vat of white powder, 66 small packets of heroin, 172 small packets of morphine, 11 morphine injections, 3 feet of needles, and equipment for manufacturing red pills and morphine, and other small items that were not counted, as well as 48 sheets of gambling flower charts, 2 books of flower association records, 5 sets of dominoes, 5 sets of mahjong tiles, 11 decks of playing cards, prohibited items, 11 fake pistols, 32 Imperial Russian banknotes, 1 photograph of the Russian Emperor, 2 passports, 20 forged official documents, 72 badges, 116 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 fen in counterfeit banknotes, 11,300 counterfeit cigarettes, 1 Russian bond, 11 flashlights, 86 keys, 1 bundle of maps, books, and waste materials, and other miscellaneous items that were not counted.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Urges Acknowledgment of Construction Fund</h3>
<p>When the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China held a representative conference of lawyers associations from various regions in Shanghai last year, it proposed constructing an association hall in the capital to enhance its appearance. This was approved by the general conference, and lawyers associations from various regions were to acknowledge the construction fund. After the representatives from various regions left the conference, they all reported the conference's decisions. Recently, a standing committee meeting was convened in the capital, and Chief Secretary Liu Liumin reported that several member associations had sent letters acknowledging the construction fund. In addition to sending reply letters of thanks, the remaining member associations that had not acknowledged the fund have now been notified separately to promptly acknowledge the construction fund for the association hall, in order to realize its construction as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Tongyi Resumption of Business is Promising</h3>
<p>Five Banks Raising 600,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Tongyi Trust Company announced its closure, five mediators, including Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Pan Zhaobang, and Chen Zhigao, hosted more than sixty representatives of creditors from both local and out-of-town areas at the Yihang Western Restaurant to discuss the company's resumption plan. At that time, the creditor representatives unanimously agreed that bankruptcy proceedings would take time, and prolonged delays would only lead to disputes over petty matters, resulting in little gain in the future. They believed that the coordinated plan was fair and appropriate and expressed their support. However, in order to support the healthy development of the new company, they hoped to find other ways to raise funds to ensure complete success. The mediators then contacted the banking industry in the city repeatedly. It has now been finalized that a syndicate of five major banks will raise 640,000 yuan in legal tender to assist. The company's prospects for resumption of business are becoming increasingly concrete.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu, Mr. Du, and Mr. Shi, at the request of creditors from both local and out-of-town areas, had previously requested the China &amp; South Sea Bank to provide loans against the Tongyi Company's debts before the lunar New Year. The bank had already stopped accepting deposits. Recently, at the request of Mr. Yu and other creditor groups, they agreed to extend the deadline and, considering the small depositors of the company, requested an increase in the value of the collateral. Therefore, they decided to extend the collateral term for deposits at Tongyi Trust Company by one month, and to specially increase the collateral value for deposits of 50 yuan or less.</p>
<h3>Pig Iron Prices Soar, Foundry Industry Raises Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, the price of Yangzi pig iron has been soaring continuously, increasing the cost of the machinery industry. The Foundry Industry Association of this city believes that the cost is too high, and raising prices is necessary to save the industry. Furthermore, because Yangzi pig iron is produced domestically, the repeated price increases are hindering the sales of domestic products. Yesterday, the eleventh executive committee meeting was convened, with all five members of the committee present, and over 4,000 factory representatives attended to listen. Chairman Zhou Cumei decided on the following key issues: (1) (2) Omitted. (3) Regarding how to remedy the recent soaring prices of raw materials, it was decided to increase the price by one point again according to the original price to cover the cost. (4) This price increase is of great importance to the industry and all colleagues should be advised to abide by it. It was decided to publish a notice to colleagues. (5) Regarding the recent sudden and abnormal increase in the price of Yangzi pig iron, which has resulted in breaches of trust and caused significant harm to the industry, it was decided to send a letter to the Liuhegou Coal Mine Company requesting them not to arbitrarily increase prices, in order to avoid hindering the sales of domestic goods. It was also decided to send a letter to the Iron Industry Association stating that future price increases should still be handled according to past practices and that a one-month notice should be given in advance. (6) Appointed a special committee to draft the industry regulations for the water industry. It was decided to appoint He Ganrong, Hu Ruixiang, and Zhu Bozhen as members responsible for drafting the regulations. The rest is omitted.</p>
<h3>Various Chambers of Commerce Invite Accountants to Lecture on Income Tax</h3>
<p>Pan Xulun and Li Wenjie Travel to Wuxi</p>
<p>Since the implementation of China's income tax regulations this year, merchants in various regions have paid close attention. It is reported that chambers of commerce in Wuxi, Yixing, Changshu, and other places, fearing that merchants are unfamiliar with tax payment procedures, have sent telegrams to the Lixin Accounting Firm in this city, inviting accountants to lecture on various income tax issues to avoid temporary difficulties. The firm's chief accountant, Pan Xulun, and accountant Li Wenjie, set off for Wuxi yesterday and will travel to Yi along the way. Accountant Chen Wenlin traveled to Changshu the day before yesterday to lecture separately.</p>

<h3>The Wang Zilin Murder Case is Bizarre and Extremely Complex</h3>
<p>Detective Bai Zhonglin Testified that the Case Was Solved Through Informants; Ordered the Deceased's Wife to Write a Letter to Summon His Two Brothers to the Case</p>
<p>Wang Zilin, a native of Zhenjiang residing at 28 Jiumu Lane, was fatally injured with an axe on Fangbang Road on May 27th. The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau Detective Team arrested Zhang Rugeng, Huang Liantang, Tao Jigen, Bao Lixue, Gao Yiyu, and others, and sent them to the District Court. Prosecutor Tang investigated and filed a public prosecution, the gist of which stated that Zhang Ruyi, also known as Zhang Yiyi, believed that Wang Zilin, also known as Wang Zilin, had an affair with his sister-in-law, Zhang Chen, and harbored resentment. Therefore, in May of last year, he conspired with Bao Lixue, Gao Yiyu, and Huang Liantang to murder Wang Zilin, and instructed Bao Lixue to instigate Bao Guanbao to carry out the plan, agreeing on a reward of 200 yuan. On the afternoon of the 26th of the same month, Bao Guanbao, together with Teng Guangyin and Tao Jigen, lay in wait at the intersection of Fangbang Road and Zhenling Street. Huang Liantang used the excuse of borrowing a radio for repairs to lure Wang Zilin to his home for repairs. When Wang Zilin returned home and passed by the intersection, Bao Guanbao and Teng Guangyin jointly stepped forward and injured his head and other parts of his body with an axe, while Tao Jigen kept watch nearby. Subsequently, Wang Zilin died of his injuries at 11:00 PM on the same day. The police were notified and arrested Zhang Chen, Zhang Shulin (i.e., Zhang Chen's husband), and Zhang Rentai, but they were released due to insufficient evidence and the wanted notices for the murderers were issued. In November of the same year, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau learned of the details and successively brought Tao Jigen, Bao Lixue, and Gao Yiyu to the court. Tao Jigen, Bao Guanbao, and Teng Guangyin were charged with the crime of committing Article 28 of the Criminal Law and Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Zhang Rugeng instructed Bao Lixue to instigate Bao Guanbao to carry out the plan, and Bao Guanbao made the decision to commit murder due to Bao Lixue's instigation. Bao Lixue was a direct instigator, and Zhang Rugeng was an indirect instigator. They were charged with instigating the commission of Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law in accordance with Article 29 of the same law. Gao Yiyu participated in the conspiracy beforehand and received a reward of 20 yuan afterward. Huang Liantang induced Wang Zilin to come to his house to repair the radio, making it convenient for Bao Guanbao and others to kill him upon his return home. They were all accomplices in the case and were charged with Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the same law in accordance with Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the same law. They were prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court yesterday to hear the case. Family members of the victim hired lawyer Shen Ying to appear in court and filed a civil lawsuit for 3,000 yuan. The defendants Tao Jigen, Bao Lixue, and Gao Yiyu, who were in custody, were brought to the court. Zhang Rugeng, Teng Guangyin, and Bao Guanbao were all at large and had been wanted. Huang Liantang was released on bail. The defendants who appeared in court all denied committing murder. Detective Bai Zhongqi, the leader of the First Squad of the Detective Team, testified that the case was solved through information from an informant, Lu Dalin. However, according to the deceased's second brother, who came from Zhenjiang, the motive for the murder was related to the affair between the deceased and his sister-in-law. Therefore, when arresting the suspects in the case, the family members of the deceased were not notified. Next, the deceased's wife, Wang Chen, testified that she was 38 years old, a native of Zhenru Yangjiaqiao. Wang Zilin was her husband. Bao Lixue worked in her house. She did not know about her husband's murder at first. Later, her husband's elder brother, Cai Lin, received two anonymous letters and told her not to seek justice. The judge, believing that the circumstances of the case were bizarre and extremely complex, and wanting to determine whether the deceased had an affair with someone or was murdered by someone, ordered the deceased's wife to write a letter to summon her two brothers to the case for a thorough investigation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Relaxes Road Plans This Year</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's road changes from last year, as well as this year's plans to widen or lengthen roads, have been prepared in a report by the Chief of the Works Department of the Municipal Council and submitted to the Council's Works Committee. The plan to widen Jiangxi Road is one of the most important items in the proposed plans. The current width of Jiangxi Road is 40 feet, but vehicular traffic in the middle section of the road is quite busy. Therefore, it is proposed to widen the section between Beijing Road and Fuzhou Road to 55 feet. The section south of Fuzhou Road, however, is where the Construction Building and Hamilton House are located, and widening would not be of any practical benefit. There had been a plan to widen Beijing Road to 70 feet in the past, but because the section east of Sichuan Road is now not very congested, it is proposed to maintain the existing width of 40 feet and not expand it further.</p>
<h3>City General Labor Union Forms Wuxi Tour Group</h3>

<h3>Municipal Hospital Regularly Opens</h3>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>The Kunshan dispatch titled "Re-Addiction Investigation and Bribery Case" published in your newspaper on February 14 contains some inaccuracies. As the case is under judicial investigation, it was inconvenient to send a letter to correct it. Now, upon reading the letter from Gao Guoshi of Zhengyi Town, Kunshan in the letter column of February 18, which stated that "Dean Chen Daheng instructed Yuan Kegong, a opium smoker under investigation at the hospital, to contact Guoshi on February 8," I am shocked. After investigation, on the afternoon of the 8th, Gao Zhongliang, the person under investigation, was found to be addicted. After the county handled the case, it was rumored that Gao Zhongliang, due to his anxiety about secretly smoking opium, had bribed someone and contacted Xue A'gen, a coachman of our hospital. I was deeply resentful when I heard about this, fearing that someone would falsely claim to be someone else to swindle money. I immediately reported it verbally to the county government and requested an investigation. I also investigated the actions of the coachman Xue A'gen, because he went out privately many times, which was obviously a malpractice. So on the morning of the 10th, I presented a report to the county government and sent him there to await investigation. The original report is in the county government, which is not difficult to prove. It is heard that the case will be sentenced soon, and the truth will come out. As for Gao Guoshi's accusation that I instigated it, it is intentional slander. In addition to filing a lawsuit according to law, I hereby send a letter to your newspaper to disclose the situation, so as to avoid confusion. Sincerely yours, to the chief editor of Shen Bao, Chen Daheng, Dean of Kunshan County Hospital, February 19th.</p>

<h3>Shi Minren's Lawsuit Against Tan Zhaohui, Her Husband of Eighteen Years</h3>

Earlier, when she was fourteen years old, she studied with him at Wanzhu Primary School in the city, and they fell in love at first sight. Therefore, from the age of seventeen, the two had lived together. In the middle, they traveled to Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin and other places, and lived in harmony. They had a son named "Nengwei." Unexpectedly, Tan recently openly published a wedding announcement in the Ta Kung Pao, knowing that Tan had asked lawyers Gu Zukuan and Zhu Shifan to prove on November 11, 1935, and married Du Hengjun at the New Asia Restaurant, and abandoned the plaintiff like old shoes. Still thinking of the eighteen years of marriage, he decided not to forget his kindness and righteousness. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to send a letter to inquire about the truth and published a notice in the newspaper to confirm the marital relationship. However, he absolutely denied the marital relationship. Therefore, his intentions are sinister, and he has long used fraud to make the plaintiff mistakenly believe that she was abandoned as her own spouse and obeyed adultery for eighteen years. Now that it has been revealed, please punish him for the crime of Article 229 of the Criminal Law. The judge opened the court for trial yesterday. The defendant did not arrive, and the lawyer claimed that he had a waist problem and was in Baolong Hospital, requesting an adjournment. The official said that he must appear in court next time, otherwise he will be arrested. The court was adjourned.</p>

<h3>Unification and Peace (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>When did the Manchu Qing Dynasty start to feel uneasy? We know that peasant uprisings were already brewing during the Qianlong period, such as the White Lotus Rebellion. Qianlong's tour to the south seemed to be the prosperous age of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, but he did not know that the signs of its defeat were gradually emerging. When the Xinhai Revolution broke out, the governors and local gentry of the Manchu Qing Dynasty often turned into the governors of the revolutionary military government. The collapse of Tongshan and the response of Yuzhong; the Manchu Qing Dynasty actually perished under this situation. Therefore, at that time, not many provinces were actually conquered by the revolutionary army, but mostly civil and military officials or gentry who attached themselves to it. Take Jiangsu Province as an example, Cheng Dequan is a prominent example. Especially Yuan Shikai in the north, because he had ambitions, his subordinates, led by Duan Qirui, telegraphed to ask the Manchu Qing Dynasty to abdicate. Did they understand the Three People's Principles at that time? No, it was the cycle of history that had arrived, and the central government (Qing court) at that time had reached the point of collapse. Fortunately, the provisional government of the Republic of China was established, and the provinces that declared independence all obeyed the provisional government, and there was no division on the surface. Later, Yuan Shikai moved the capital to Beijing, and the result was that the old forces defeated the new forces. Although the old forces won, they had already reached the period of collapse of the central government, and it was impossible for him to unify by relying on the power of the warlords. After Yuan's failure, it evolved into warlord separatism, and the governor-general group appeared. What is the governor-general group? The governor-general group is a grand alliance of separatist forces. Not only could the central government not command him, but he could command the central government, and even Zhang Dong led troops to Beijing to restore the monarchy. During the Zhili-Anhui War, the Zhili-Fengtian War, and the Qi-Lu War, the highest peak of warlord separatism was formed. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen clarified the national system of the Republic of China, there was no emperor, and these warlords dared not openly claim to be kings no matter what. Otherwise, Feng Guozhang was a king, Zhang Dong was also a king, Zhang Zuolin was also a king, and Wu Peifu was also a king. It could have turned into seventeen or eighteen countries, which would have been even more unimaginable!</p>
<p>This situation of military generals' separation and non-respect for the central unification did not begin in the early years of the Republic of China, and its far-reaching causes were sown in the late Qing Dynasty. But look at the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu. Before the war broke out, Li Hongzhang said, "Now, the ministers in the interior and the frontier officials in the exterior have not been able to cooperate," "The governors of the provinces cannot be of one mind and agree with each other, and the boundaries of vision are obstructed in the middle, and the situation of restraint is on the outside." When the war had begun, the Naval Yamen wanted to combine the Nanyang and Fujian Ocean fleets with the Beiyang fleet into one army. Nanyang said, "Wu Song is the key point of the Yangtze River and the sea, and warships are difficult to withdraw." Fujian Ocean said, "The wound of Ma Jiang has not yet recovered, and Taiwan's defense is even more strict?" With this kind of disunity and separatist situation, no wonder the Japanese said that after the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu, Japan only fought with Li Hongzhang alone. We understand the recent century of Chinese history, understand the cycle of history, then the warlord separatism of the past twenty years after the establishment of the Republic of China, its root cause is indeed very far. But after the separation, will we always let him separate? If we always separate, China will be no less than seventeen or eighteen countries. To make it truly create a country, there is only one road to complete unification. Mencius said, "How can the world be settled? It is settled in one." Only by being settled in one can there be peace. There was the separatist rule of the heroes at the end of the Yuan Dynasty, and there must be Zhu Yuanzhang's unification. With Zhu Yuanzhang's unification, there was the peace of the founding of the Ming Dynasty: there was the separatist rule of the heroes at the end of the Sui Dynasty, and there must be Li Shimin's unification. With Li Shimin's unification, there was the peace of the founding of the Tang Dynasty. This is a definite principle. We have experienced twenty years of dissuasion and internal wars, suffered greatly, and of course hope for peace, and the only way to achieve peace is unification. This is the inevitable evolution of history, and no matter what party or faction, they cannot deny the need for peace, especially the need for unification.</p>
<p>How can we seek peace? Of course, we must eliminate the forces of separatism. How can we eliminate the forces of separatism? My answer is unification. The opposite of unification is separatism, and the result of separatism is war. Therefore, only by supporting the forces of unification can we eliminate all the forces of separatism and achieve true peace. This is our belief.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Perhaps some people say that seeking peace does not necessarily rely on unification, and "alliance" can also seek peace. They seem to regard alliance and 'unification' as the same thing, as if the English word United can be translated as alliance, and it is not impossible to translate it as unification. But it also seems to be regarded as two different things, so they sometimes say "seek unification with alliance." In fact, alliance and unification are like Yang Huo who looks like Confucius, there is a great difference. What is the difference? Before the alliance, there must be many units, at least two or more units, to connect and combine them, but no matter how they are united, the internal units still exist: this is called alliance. The so-called unification is to melt the original units into a whole unit after the unification movement. The original units cannot be distinguished at all. This is unification. That is, Mencius called it settling in one. Therefore, alliance and unification, seemingly similar but not really, are really not the same thing. The starting point of alliance is to recognize many units and never eliminate them; the starting point of unification is only one unit. Take a look at the history of China, is the peace after unification in the past dynasties achieved by uniting many units that coexisted? Or is it sold by unifying into one unit? The reason why China can continue to the present and become the oldest and longest-lasting country is that the spirit of "one unit" is there. If alliance can achieve peace, then we must not forget two things: the first is the provincial autonomy advocated around 1921. At that time, they wanted to unite the giants of each province, let them govern themselves in each province, and then unite again, but did they achieve peace? As a result, it was scattered. The second is the governor-general group in the fifth and sixth years of the Republic of China. The members of the governor-general group were all top-notch figures with military and financial power in their hands. Isn't the group they organized an alliance? But the result was still no peace. Why? Because both provincial autonomy and the governor-general group are separatist and anti-unification; anti-unification is anti-peace, so the result must not be peace, but prolong the situation of non-peace. Therefore, the term "alliance" sounds good on the surface, but in reality it is equal to poison with sugar coating. We want true peace, only true unification. This kind of sugar-coated poison - that is, alliance - can never get true peace. Today, everyone's interests are the same, and they reluctantly unite. Tomorrow, when the interests conflict, they will immediately turn against each other and fight. Do our people need this kind of fickle alliance? Our 450 million old people have no separate units, no one says that I am from Shandong, and the Shandong gang should form a military unit to fight the Jiangsu gang. I am from Jiangsu, and the Jiangsu gang should form a unit to fight the Zhejiang gang; no one says that we Zhejiang people should unite to fight the Guangdong gang, and the two Guangs unite to fight the two Hubs. Basically, we don't need independent units, these independent units are what the warlords want to control. This warlord controls this unit as his own system and strength; that warlord controls that unit as his own system and strength. May I ask, isn't this division and separation? This kind of division and separation, we should first admit it, and then reluctantly unite it, can we admit it? Also, they say in unison that all parties and factions should unite, but in reality they want us to recognize the so-called "Red Army" system and the so-called "Soviet" political slot of the Communist Party, and recognize it as an independent unit. Can we tolerate it? Why don't we, the common people, take out the attitude of the masters of the house and deny all their small units? We only need the entire unit of the Chinese nation and the Republic of China. With this only unit, we can maintain the entire unification of China and guarantee the country's long-term peace. As for seeking peace through alliance, or seeking unification through alliance, it is a deceptive statement.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Fabric</h3>
<p>The Yarn Market Suddenly Turns Good</p>
<p>Indian Merchants Prepare to Receive Goods with Bullish Positions - The Current Month Rises a Full Dollar - Although the Bears Have Chips to Deliver - The Market is Not Affected in Any Way</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the afternoon after falling in the morning, and the momentum turned good again. It is said that there is only one day of business left for the current month's yarn. According to market news, Indian merchants are preparing to receive goods with bullish positions. Therefore, not only are they not selling this month, but they are also continuing to buy and increase their positions, which shows their determination. At the same time, the spot yarn sales market is still active. Although the bears have a huge amount of chips to deliver, the market is not affected. As of yesterday afternoon, there were already 21,450 bales of yarn in the warehouse.</p>
<p>The Current Month's Yarn Actually Increases Positions</p>
<p>In the pre-market opening of standard yarn, all months except the current month fell across the board, and the decline was severe. Among the industry, the yarn delivered by the bears in the warehouse reached 20,007 bales as of last night. Therefore, the cautious sentiment is strong. However, the Indian merchants not only did not close their large amount of February positions, but instead came to buy. It is found that there is only one day of trading left this Monday for the current month. Seeing that the market is firm and rising, retail investors have to make up for it. The far month was driven up by it. As a result, each month fell by 6.8 cents from the closing price of the previous day, but the current month did not move. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market atmosphere was slightly tight. It was rumored in the market that a certain yarn factory had a labor dispute. The bulls still did not relax. Grade 3 yarn rebounded by 2.3 yuan, and the popularity was still strong. Until the closing of the third session, it was said that more than 1,000 bales were dragged into February again, and the market price became more firm. The spot yarn transaction still reached more than 2,000 bales, and the market gradually moved upward. As a result, each month rose by 9 cents to 1 yuan compared with the closing price in the morning. It is found that Jifeng sold 800 bales, Tongfu 600 bales, Hexing 1,300 bales, Yuan Yi 750 bales, Dachangcheng 1,650 bales, Changfeng 1,150 bales, Xiecheng 550 bales, Fukang 1,100 bales, and Dafeng 400 bales.

<p>Cotton Futures Finally Feel Unsupported</p>
<p>Abundant Cotton Stock in Inland - Factory Demand Also Appears Stagnant</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending weak, the downward trend is intensifying, the popularity is slack, and it is rumored in the market that a certain yarn factory has a slight labor dispute, and the cotton stock in the inland is still abundant. Therefore, the industry is inclined to sell together. At the same time, the current cotton factory demand is turning sluggish, and the sellers are more active. The market is falling further.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Falls More Than 3 Cents</p>
<p>In the pre-market opening of standard cotton, because American cotton and Indian cotton were deliberately falling, it was measured that the momentum was very weak, and the people's hearts were even more depressed. And most of them were inclined to sell because the cotton stock in the inland was abundant and had not yet been shipped out, so the market situation was even more difficult to rise. As a result, each month fell by 1.5 cents to 2.3 cents compared with the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market price was very weak, because there was a rumor of a labor dispute in a small number of yarn factories, and at the same time, the current cotton factory demand was stagnant, and the situation was even weaker. As a result, each month fell by 0.5 cents to 1.2 cents compared with the closing price in the morning. It is found that Yuda sold 1,600 piculs, Jifeng 1,200 piculs, Zhenda 1,000 piculs, Hexing 2,200 piculs, Fengtai 2,000 piculs, Yuan Yi 1,500 piculs, Runkang 1,800 piculs, Changhe 3,600 piculs, Taixing 1,800 piculs, Xingchang 1,400 piculs, Fukang 1,700 piculs, Tonghe 1,600 piculs, and Yuanxingchang 2,500 piculs.

The highest and lowest prices of the day and the closing price are listed below.</p>
<p>No Source of Current Cotton at All</p>
<p>The current cotton consumption is lonely, the factory demand is stagnant, and there is no source at all.</p>

<p>American Cotton Bulls Move to Far Months</p>
<p>Yesterday, when American cotton opened, each month fell by 2 pound sounds to a rise of 2 pound sounds. In-field trading, because the delivery notice will be issued next Tuesday, most of the bulls in March closed and moved to far months. Although the industry and spot traders tried to buy, the sellers were even more vigorous. As for other months, they were quite quiet. The price increase of wartime materials was not noticed. At the close, cotton farmers slightly hedged, and the market was stable. It is estimated that spot fell by 1 pound sound, futures fell by 3 pound sound, British cotton spot fell by 1 point, futures rose by 1 point, Indian cotton fell at first due to the large-scale selling of short positions and the closing of long positions, and then rebounded due to the purchase of exporters and local factories. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 0.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 0.5 to 0.75 rupees, Bailuoxi fell by 1.25 to 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 19th).</p>

<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>The Seasonal Cotton Cloth Sales Market is Quite Smooth</p>
<p>Yesterday, cotton cloth saw a rebound in both Grade 3 and standard yarn. The auction price of Qingdao piece goods remained firm. The trend of cotton cloth gradually showed progress, and the people's hearts were good because of it. Yesterday, the Tianjin gang continued to handle more than 200 bales of fine cloth with floral and bird patterns for this month, and the Zhenjiang gang also came to wholesale and add more than 200 bales of fine cloth with double dragon pearl patterns. The colored cloth shops in this street felt that there was a lack of spot fine cloth, and the stock of out-of-piece colored cloth was not thick. They competed to prepare blank cloth to meet the needs of customers, so the sales of fine cloth were the most active. Yesterday, 500 to 600 bales of Dong goods and local factory goods were sold, mostly for the delivery of goods this month. Because they are eager to use them, the business of Fuzhou, Guangdong and the Yangtze River ports is gradually increasing. There are many wholesale purchases of goods with coincidental prices, but they are limited to goods that are seasonal and will soon be sold. The goods that were sold in winter and the New Year are swept away at the bottom, and the addition is sparse. White goods and coarse cloth are consistently needed by military uniforms and inland, Guangdong and Yangtze River gangs. The labor dispute in the British company's Public Welfare Factory is delayed and the supply is insufficient, and the market is very firm.</p>
<p>Domestically Produced Serge Sells Well</p>
<p>Domestically produced Yuanzang plain serge is currently selling well. The wool industry in this street is also selling it because the arrival and stock of imported goods are limited. In addition, Chinese uniforms are mostly purchased in spring, which leads to an increase in daily sales. Among them, the Zhanghua 918 and Dalong 128 brands are selling even better, and the selling price has increased by 5 cents. For example, Zhanghua 918 sells for 3.05 yuan, and Dalong 128 sells for 3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>The Futures Flour Market Sees Another Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning, the market in each month showed a consistent rebound. The price of foreign wheat was unchanged in Chicago in the near term and down 1.65 cents in the far term. Canada was good for 48 points, and Liverpool was zero pence. Therefore, after the opening price, the people's hearts in each month seemed to be slightly stable. The current month is only a few days away from the end-of-month delivery (the exchange is scheduled to be auctioned until the 24th), but the chips for long and short positions have decreased. Therefore, although it was flat at first, it immediately rebounded. In March, because there were not many outsiders, a lot of outsiders absorbed it, and the market stood up. In April, outsiders bought even more smoothly, and the jump was sharper. In July, the bulls reversed and left, and the rise weakened. The current market situation is because the outside transaction is more prosperous than the customer gang, so the rise and fall are impermanent and difficult to grasp. However, in terms of facts, it must be determined by whether the actual sales are smooth or not.</p>
<p>Although the Spot Wheat is Greedy, There is Still a Lack of Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market, the market in each month showed a steady trend. The price of foreign wheat was down 0.1 cent in Chicago, up 48 points in Canada, and up 1 penny in Liverpool. When the opening price was, the foreign wheat was relatively good, and the standard of this month was recovered by the factory recently because the factory was still greedy for the spot wheat, and the spot was removed. The people's hearts in the industry inevitably turned firm. The opening prices in February, March and April were 67 cents better, and then they fluctuated. The new wheat in June and July was relatively scarce, and the long-term flour market was still popular, so it continued to be 23 cents better. The owners of the current wheat raised the price, so there was no transaction.</p>
<p>The Sales of Passenger Indica Rice in This Street are Still Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of customer indica rice in this area were still strong, and customer transformation was still sluggish. The Shantou gang embellished it slightly, and lacked a smooth stomach for a long time. And in recent days, the arrival is booming, with more than 12,000 to 20,000 arriving every day. It is difficult to expect the market to improve for a while. However, yesterday, Japanese transformation was very active, and the owners were not in a hurry to sell, so the market was temporarily stabilized. A total of 565 bales of Hunan rice and 6,850 bales of Jiangxi rice were opened throughout the day, and most of them were handled by this street.</p>
<p>The River Rice Market Rebounded Slightly</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of more than thirty gangs arrived, with about 6,300 to 6,400 stones of goods, including more than twenty gangs of thin rice. The sales market in this street is still limited, and the acceptance is still slack. Only the Qingdao gang handled 400 to 500 bales of thin rice. Fortunately, the weather was overcast and rainy, and the people's hearts turned firm. Therefore, the thin rice market turned into a fixed situation, and the thick japonica rice rebounded by an angle due to the scarcity of arrivals. The future trend must be based on the acceptance and whether it is smooth or not as a shift. Duyang and Yinyuan have no honor or disgrace.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the goods arriving from various routes under the river were sparse, about sixteen or seventeen gangs. In the morning, because the rain did not stop, there were few buyers and sellers on the market, resulting in limited transactions of various goods, and the market was stable. Later, because it was seen that the Xi'an gang was actively handling the acceptance, the customer's nature turned firm.</p>
<p>The Yellow Soybean is Still Selling Well</p>
<p>- Sesame Seeds are Softening -</p>
<p>Yellow Soybean: Yesterday, the yellow soybean market situation, first rose and tightened due to the rise of the Dalian market, and then stabilized due to the fall of the Dalian market. A total of seventeen cars of Siping Street beans, eight cars of Bengbu beans, one car of Linhuaiguan beans, and one car of Fanjia Tun beans were opened throughout the day. The destination was oil extraction plants and inland car workshops. In addition, Shantou and others in this street handled 250 bales of Dingjiazhou beans, 2,000 bales of Hankou Zhazha beans, 200 bales of Jiujiang Late beans, 270 bales of Jiujiang Winter beans, and 300 bales of Pinghu Doudou beans.</p>
<p>Sesame Seeds: Yesterday, the market situation of foreign village sesame seeds was still softening. Because the foreign market situation was not good, foreign companies were observing the acceptance. The current spot of raw sesame seeds was flat.</p>
<p>Soybean Oilcake is Stable in the Far Term</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Lian city telecommunications turned good, and the futures soybean oilcake market saw a rebound and stability. However, the actual sales of current beans have been very sluggish recently, and the stock is sufficient. It is difficult for the recent standard beans to develop further. The closing was only 2 points better. There were hoarders inquiring about the far term, and it rebounded by 45 points. The actual sales of oil and cake were still okay, and the selling momentum of the firms has slowed down, which has led to the entry of short-covering and outsiders. Each month rebounded consistently, with the futures oil rising by 1.5 to 2.5 cents, and the standard cake rising by 1.5 cents. However, the Dalian market has not yet entered the track, and the future market is difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>

Daily businesses sold into the market after the initial opening. Banks also sold US dollars. Although Mobil Oil was settling, the situation had leveled out. The midday selling price for the British pound was one shilling and two pence and five-sixteenths of a farthing in the near term, and the US dollar was $29.625, unchanged from the previous close for both the British pound and US dollar. Chinese merchants sold a small amount of Sterling, but the Japanese yen was still in a short covering situation. Mobil Oil continued to settle US dollars. A record of the transactions follows:</p>
<p>In the Sterling exchange market, the morning selling price for the near term was one shilling and two and a half pence. HSBC and Da British were buying January contracts at half a penny. The midday selling price for spot was one shilling and two pence and five hundred thirty-one thousand two hundred and fiftieths of a farthing. February contracts were paired at half a penny and five hundred thirty-one thousand two hundred and fiftieths.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Sudden Large-Scale Selling of Class A Shares</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was chaotic, with mostly swap transactions. Market prices fluctuated erratically, with ups and downs. However, there was a sudden large-scale selling of Class A shares in issues 45 and 46, with many sales also in the current month. With the February settlement approaching, this phenomenon naturally indicates that those with physical shares were selling. Furthermore, Issue 47, despite having short positions in Class A shares, did not cover them at this opportunity, suggesting that Class A shares are not likely to rally in the short term. Although investor sentiment remains relatively stable, the trend appears weak. Next Monday and Tuesday, the final two days of the February futures contracts, are expected to see intense competition between the long and short positions. Yesterday's trading saw significant buying and swapping in issues 10 and 43. Issue 5 saw strong buying of both Class C and D shares for the current month. Issues 11 and 16 saw considerable selling. Consequently, although Class C and D shares rose by 30-50 cents, they gradually weakened afterward. Turning to Class A shares, there was a sudden sale of several hundred thousand shares by Issue 15, causing a drop of 1.5 cents. The changing market sentiment immediately became evident. In the afternoon session, Issue 43 continued to swap short positions, while Issue 10 continued to buy. However, selling became increasingly active, with front-month contracts falling by 20-30 cents. Later, Issues 45 and 46 simultaneously sold Class A shares, causing a sharp drop of 55 cents in the current month. Distant-month contracts also followed with a small drop of 4 cents. As a result, front-month contracts mostly rose by 10 to 25 cents. Distant-month Class B shares turned down, falling by 1 cent. Class A shares fell by 7 cents in the current month and 4 cents in distant-month contracts. The total trading volume was 5.8 million yuan. A comparative list of the resulting gains and losses follows (unit: yuan, cent unit: hundred yuan):</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Unified Sales and Transportation of Green Tea Unlikely</p>
<p>To develop Chinese tea's foreign trade, the Ministry of Industry previously planned to unite Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Zhejiang, and Fujian provinces, as well as tea merchants from various regions, to organize a National Tea Company. This was intended to unify exports and improve production, sales, manufacturing, and transportation. However, it has been learned that although the Ministry is preparing to proceed with this plan, after discussions between Committee Member Shou Jingwei and various parties, its implementation will require more time. Unified sales and transportation in Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and other provinces seem unlikely to materialize this year. The Keemun black tea will continue to be managed by the Anhui-Jiangxi Black Tea Sales and Transportation Committee.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>Wholesale Price Index Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Up 16.6% From the Same Time Last Year</p>
<p>Metal and Production Goods See the Largest Increases</p>
<p>According to a report by the National Tariff Commission, the Shanghai wholesale price index and cost of living index (Note 1) for January 1937, both increased compared to the previous month. The overall wholesale index was 121.6, up 2.4% from the previous month and 16.6% from the same month last year. This is the highest peak since January 1932, almost returning to the price levels of the early economic downturn. The categorized indices (Note 2) are compared with the previous month as follows:</p>
<p>Wholesale Classified Index 1: All eight categories of the index increased compared to the previous month. Among them, metals, grains, building materials, and miscellaneous items saw the largest increases. The metal category rose by 11.9%. Hardware prices continued to rise due to ongoing increases in overseas pricing. Local inventories were extremely scarce, leading to a sharp increase in sales prices. The category index has been rising steadily since July of last year, with particularly rapid increases in the last three months. The index was still at 131.3 in October of last year, then rose to 140.4 in November, 154.1 in December, and 172.4 this month, an increase of over 30% compared to October. The grain category rose by 3.4%. Although sales of wheat and domestically produced flour slowed down, resulting in price declines, the prices of various types of rice increased uniformly. For example, Suchang japonica rice saw a sharp price increase of over 20% compared to the previous month due to strong sales. Kehsien indica rice, due to a severe shortage of grain in Guangdong Province and eager purchasing, saw prices rise along with foreign rice. Imported flour also saw price increases due to shortages, and red sorghum, corn, and beans all showed the same trend due to shortages in both arrivals and inventories. The building materials category rose by 2.7%. Black bricks, glass sheets, Douglas fir, and cedar all saw price increases. The miscellaneous category rose by 2.3%. Asphalt saw a sudden increase due to strong overseas sales, and glazed paper saw a sudden increase due to a lack of spot goods. Tung oil, bean cake, white bottom leather, pig intestines, and vegetable bowls also tended towards firmness and high prices.</p>
<p>Wholesale Classified Index 2: This classified index is divided into two categories and six items. Its index also increased uniformly compared to the previous month. The raw materials category rose by 3.1%, while the manufactured goods category rose by only 2.0%. Among raw materials, the forest products and agricultural products categories saw the largest increases. The forest products index rose by 4.1% due to the rising prices of asphalt, tung oil, cedar, Douglas fir, and white firewood. The agricultural products index rose by 3.6%, with white rice and beans seeing price increases, and jute following the same trend. Among manufactured goods, the rate of increase for production goods was higher than for consumer goods. The production goods index rose by 4.4%, the largest increase among all categories. The index has been rising sharply in the last four or five months. The index was still at 109.1 in September of last year, but it has reached 129.9 this month, an increase of 19.1%. This is because the prices of cotton yarn and hardware in this category have risen sharply. Although yarn prices have slightly declined this month, hardware prices have continued to rise. White factory silk has also increased in price due to a shortage of raw materials and reported price increases in the United States and Japan. The consumer goods index rose by 2.0%. Domestically produced flour, green tea, coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, fresh dried salted fish, and soybean oil all saw price declines. However, red and white sugar saw frequent price increases due to large purchases by European merchants in Java and a sharp reduction in sugar inventories in the producing areas. The local association's price quotes were repeatedly raised. Although sales of silk crepe were sluggish and weak, prices still increased due to the high price of silk. Kerosene, gasoline, burlap, fine gabardine also reported price increases.</p>
<p>Cost of Living Index: The overall index was 120.1, up 2.2% from the previous month and 8.2% from the same month last year. This is the highest record since July 1932. All five categories of the index increased compared to the previous month, with the food category seeing the largest increase, and the other four categories seeing only slight increases. The food category rose by 4.0%, with white rice prices rising along with wholesale prices, and soybean and table salt prices also trending higher. Meat and vegetables all increased in price due to increased demand at the end of the lunar year. The clothing category rose by 0.2%, with cotton prices rising frequently in recent months, leading to increased retail prices. Fine twill fabric and zhigong ni rose slightly, while coarse cloth and fine cloth declined slightly. According to recent surveys, rent has hardly changed. The index for this month was 109.1, up only 0.1% from the previous month. The fuel category rose by 0.5%, and the miscellaneous category rose by 0.1%. The increase in these two categories was due to the price increases of coal balls and towels.</p>
<p>The index of each category for this month is listed below for comparison with the previous month and the same month last year.</p>
<p>(Note 1) The import and export price index is under revision and will be temporarily suspended from this month.</p>
<p>(Note 2) The wholesale price index is classified into eight categories according to the nature and use of the goods. The old categories will be retained, as in Shanghai Wholesale Price Index Table 1. A classified index is added according to the degree of processing of the goods and will be published monthly thereafter, as in Shanghai Wholesale Price Index Table 2. The categories to which each item belongs and the classified index for each month since January 1921 are detailed in the Economic Statistics Series No. 12 of this Committee.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Children's Special</p>
<h3>Laziness and Diligence</h3>
<p>— Wan Wen</p>
<p>Laziness and diligence, when we see this topic, we naturally feel that laziness is a bad habit. Diligence is the opposite. If we ask the children whether they like to be lazy children or diligent children, I believe you will all answer that you like to be diligent children. However, in our daily lives, we can see that there are more lazy people than diligent people. Although they know that laziness is a bad habit, although lazy people are also working, it is just perfunctory. This situation can also be found in school life. Some students are too lazy to prepare their textbooks every day, and they do not get promoted at the end of the semester. This is the result of laziness. Of course, there are other reasons.</p>
<p>It is just a temporary awakening for a lazy child to change to being diligent, and he will soon return to his old ways, unless he is determined to succeed as a diligent child. However, it is difficult. It is very easy for a diligent child to become lazy. As long as you don't do as you did before, you can immediately become a lazy child. Why is this? Because laziness is too comfortable and too leisurely. Human nature loves to enjoy, while diligence is too laborious and too strenuous. People naturally don't like these.</p>
<p>How can we distinguish the pros and cons of laziness and diligence? Lazy people appear listless and have an unhappy attitude towards everything. Diligent people are not like this. They can not only feel the fun of working, but also enjoy the happiness of the results after working.</p>
<p>Therefore, I hope you children! If you were lazy children before, then now resolutely change to diligent children, and don't covet comfort and leisure. If you were diligent children before, you should be even more diligent now, and don't be tempted by comfort and leisure. Always be diligent children.</p>
<h3>About Han Xin's Humiliation Under the Crotch</h3>
<p>— Wo Fo</p>
<p>Children, you probably all know the story about Han Xin being humiliated by crawling under someone's crotch. It is about when Han Xin was a child, he often liked to take his sword outside, with a very heroic attitude. Unexpectedly, a rogue saw him and was very dissatisfied, so he said to him: If you have the ability, use your sword to stab me, otherwise, you have to crawl under my crotch. Han Xin had no choice but to crawl under the rogue's crotch, and the people in the market all laughed. But later, the story about Han Xin being humiliated by crawling under someone's crotch was instead passed down as a historical anecdote, and everyone praised him, saying that he was able to endure.</p>
<p>In fact, the place we should focus on in this story is not his endurance, but his striving. His endurance was temporary shamelessness, and his striving was long-term knowing shame. Therefore, we should not learn his shamelessness, that is, even if we must temporarily endure shame, we should immediately follow that with knowing shame and engage in long-term striving. For example, if Han Xin was only shameless at the time, but did not know shame, and only endured temporarily but did not strive for a long time, he would not only suffer this humiliation of crawling under someone's crotch once, but would suffer the humiliation of crawling under someone's crotch for the rest of his life. Because he was able to know shame, and he was able to strive for a long time, he finally washed away this humiliation and also established great achievements.</p>
<p>Now, we are in such an environment and position, perhaps there is also a need for temporary endurance like Han Xin being humiliated by crawling under someone's crotch. But after learning Han Xin's temporary shamelessness, we must also learn Han Xin's long-term knowing shame, so that the result of our striving can wash away the shame of this endurance. This is what children should pay special attention to when hearing or telling this story.</p>
<h3>A Record of Little Star Hu Rongrong</h3>
<p>— Man Zi</p>
<p>There are very few child stars in the Chinese film industry. In Shanghai, only Chen Juanjuan and Hu Rongrong have the best performance skills. Rongrong is younger than Juanjuan, which makes it even more commendable. She is only seven years old this year and is studying at Jing'an Elementary School. She is the class leader of the second grade of primary school. Last year, her academic performance was the best in the entire school, so she received a scholarship, which exempted her from one year's tuition. More than a thousand younger brothers and sisters were all defeated by her, so we can know that her wisdom and efforts are very promising in the future.</p>
<p>Her first film attempt was "Parents and Children." Although the Cultural Film Company has become a historical term, the wonderful impression she left on tens of millions of viewers will always exist. When she arrived at the Star Film Company, she first showed a little talent in "Eternal Smile." Recently, she starred in "New Year's Money." In "New Year's Money," the most moving performances are two: one is the wooden puppet soldiers' sword dance; the other is the tap dance after eating New Year's Eve dinner.</p>
<p>Her dance was instructed by a foreign teacher. Fortunately, she also has a tutor, her sister-in-law Ms. Gong Qiuxia, who is also good at singing and dancing, enough to help her with her usual review and learning.</p>
<p>Ms. Qiuxia said: "This time's filming of New Year's Money was in the cold winter and at midnight. The weather was so cold that she had to wear thin dance clothes, which froze her teeth to chatter. She endured it, understood the plot, and listened to the director's instructions, singing and dancing, not at all less than her usual practice at home. This little girl, whose milk teeth have not dried yet, is able to devote herself to art so wholeheartedly that even I admire her. Therefore, after the completion, everyone congratulated her, and the director even gave her the honor of genius."</p>
<p>Genius, of course, can make a person achieve success quickly, but learning is also an indispensable fertilizer. I hope her guardians will pay attention to this point and not let a very promising star end here.</p>
<h3>A Letter from Jill to Mr.</h3>
<p>— Shi Peng</p>
<p>—Report on Life During Vacation</p>
<p>Mr.:</p>
<p>It has been ten days since I left you. Perhaps you are anxious to know about my life these ten days!</p>
<p>Originally, my work plan during the winter vacation, in addition to reviewing my own homework, the remaining time would be spent according to what you instructed us: "Do more things that are beneficial to people." For this sentence, I had repeatedly pondered in my mind; if a person does it alone, I am afraid that he will feel lonely and inevitably make mistakes. So, on the second day of the vacation, I went to discuss with Mingsheng, and he very much agreed with my proposal - to do it together. At that time, we formulated two tasks to do every afternoon. What are those two tasks? First, teach those workers one lesson every day; second, report the major events of the country to them on the same day. Since the implementation of these two tasks, we have been taking turns to do them. The most worthy thing to tell you is that every time we go to their home, they not only do not dislike us, but are very happy to welcome us! I think the reason is probably that every time we go, we do not interfere with their work!</p>
<p>Later, when we meet on the street, we greet each other very warmly. I remember that in the first few days when we went to their home, they often told us how difficult their lives were, but they no longer talked to us about it later. Recently, they also hated those madmen who acted as guides for the enemy in the Shaanxi Incident. Mr., I have written a lot, let's talk again! I wish you</p>
<p>Happiness</p>
<p>Your student Jill Shang on the 20th</p>
<h3>Song of Returning Spring</h3>
<p>— You Si Xing Yuan</p>
<p>Spring is back!</p>
<p>A glimmer of life has been revealed in the universe,</p>
<p>Two or three white ducks are playing in the heart of the lake,</p>
<p>The forest contains the goddess of spring.</p>
<p>In a blink of an eye; the gentle breeze is blowing, the spring is bright,</p>
<p>There are also swallows chirping in the green shade,</p>
<p>Peach and plum blossoms compete for beauty, and hundreds of flowers are in bud,</p>
<p>Butterflies are flying in the lush grass.</p>
<p>Spring is the most joyful time,</p>
<p>But I am worried that spring will come and go again!</p>
<p>There is no feast in the world that does not end,</p>
<p>Spring is gone; it just leaves people with sweet memories.</p>
<p>Children's Creation</p>
<h3>Snowy Morning</h3>
<p>— Wu Pinxian, a 5th grader from Zhiben Elementary School</p>
<p>One morning, when I was sleeping soundly, I suddenly heard the clock strike six times. I hurriedly put on my clothes and went for a walk in the backyard. The ground and the withered branches were covered with a layer of snow. Those flowers and plants that lacked resistance had all withered. Only the plum blossoms in the east of the garden were able to muster their spirits, resist the frost and snow, and present their quiet posture, which is truly admirable! I wandered around the flowers several times, and I felt that the Suiyuan Province in northern China is now being harassed by pseudo-bandits. A group of loyal and brave soldiers are fighting the enemy unyieldingly in the cold ice and snow. Their spirit is truly like plum blossoms.</p>
<h3>What did you use to calculate the time when there were no clocks?</h3>
<p>— Zai Xiang</p>
<p>When we go on a trip to the countryside, if we don't bring a watch, can we still know the time at that time? Perhaps a few experienced children can tell the approximate time by looking at the length of people's shadows, but if it is cloudy, there is no way.</p>
<p>Let's think back to ancient times. When there were no clocks, how did they calculate the time? What did they use to calculate the time? This is a very interesting and worthy of discussion question:</p>
<p>In the beginning, people didn't count time in one or two hours, but only "one day," which meant that the sun rose in the east and set in the west once.</p>
<p>Later, because there were more businesses, it was felt that counting time in one day was too simple, so some people came up with several more advanced methods of counting time.</p>
<p>(1) Candle Clock: This is a kind of timekeeping device used at night (see Figure 1). It is a special candle with five grids carved on it. One grid can burn for one watch of time, so it is called a candle clock; when this candle is completely burned, it is exactly five watches of time, and people get up to work at this time.</p>
<p>(2) Copper Pot Drip: This timekeeping device has many shapes, but the general shape is always similar (see Figure 2): a trapezoidal frame is used, with five water-leaking buckets placed on it. Water drips from the top to the bottom bucket, which is called one day or one night. This is more advanced than "candle clock".</p>
<p>The above two are the most popular in our country, but there are more than these two, such as: "Measuring the sun's shadow with a bamboo pole", "Cock's crowing" etc. Before there were clocks abroad, they also used this kind of simple timekeeping device, such as: water clock, sand clock (similar to our country's drip)...etc.</p>
<p>In short, before the invention of anything, there is always an interesting process, such as: "How did they make fire before there were matches?" "How did they do it at night before there were electric lights and kerosene lamps?" ... If we just think about it, we will develop an interest in studying the history of human life.</p>

<h3>Justice (5)</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>But those sharks were always entangling them, unwilling to let go. Again and again, they heard cries of agony, and they could see the seawater gradually turning red, knowing that the sailors hanging on the side of the lifeboat were being snatched away by the sharks one by one. Finally, only six people remained. The first mate glanced into the boat and stopped paddling. It turned out that one of his legs had also been bitten off by a shark at that moment, but in order not to alarm the sailors, he gritted his teeth and endured the pain, never making a shout or groan. Therefore, the sailors did not know what had happened until his second leg was bitten off, and he could not help but cry out in pain. At the same time, his hands gripping the side of the boat also let go. Immediately, two people grabbed him and pulled him into the boat. He lay there, trembling with pain, but still concerned about the safety of the sailors. He called the youngest sailor, Wilson, over, precisely because he was the youngest, he took extra care of him, so that he would be less in danger. In the first mate's mind, only he might survive this time. So, the first mate solemnly instructed him to tell the Secretary of the Navy when he returned that they had gone to Ang Tau Wah to search for pirates but had unfortunately encountered danger. He continued, "Tell the Secretary of the Navy that my sailors have fulfilled their responsibilities, and they are blameless. In addition, I have one more request, which is to ask him to promote Maeldler to gunner."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he shook hands with the sailors one by one to bid farewell and struggled to say some optimistic words to encourage them; however, he had been exposed to the scorching sun all day long and had been without food or drink, so he was already exhausted and had no strength to speak. At sunset, the sharks attacked again. The sailors screamed and busied themselves, quickly capsizing the lifeboat again. And the first mate's suffering ended in the towering waves.</p>
<p>This brave first mate, Edward Smith, came from Hampshire and was the most beloved and promising son in his family, raised by a widowed and loving mother. Since joining the navy, he had been highly regarded by Sir Hastings, the Secretary of the Navy. But seeing him in the midst of life-and-death danger, still maintaining a calm attitude, directing his subordinates to fulfill their responsibilities, knowing only others and not himself, this great spirit is very sufficient to be a model for young people.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<h3>A Record of Round-the-World Air Travel (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Dr. Falconer of America</p>
<p>At 7:22 PM on November 1st, we flew to Wake Island and learned that the China Clipper would be flying to Manila from there, carrying only two passengers this time. At 6:00 AM the next morning, the China Clipper set off for Guam. Shortly after, we received a wireless telegram saying that it had been forced to return to Wake Island due to encountering a hurricane en route. Pan American Airlines had built hotels on Guam, Wake Island, and Midway Island, all equipped with electric lights and private bathrooms, making passengers very comfortable, and the meals were also extremely exquisite. At 6:16 AM on Monday, November 2nd, a few minutes after the China Clipper departed, we also left Wake Island for Midway Island. This leg of the flight was 1185 miles long and we arrived at 4:05 PM on Sunday, November 1st. Why did we fly for a day and go back a day? This is because the 180th meridian west is the International Date Line. The days on Earth are counted from this line. This line is very close to the west of Midway Island. If it is Sunday, November 1st, just west of this date line, it is still Sunday, November 1st, to the east of this line. Therefore, the two days we spent were both Sunday, November 1st.</p>
<p>The Pacific Commercial Cable Company has established a cable station on Midway Island for 33 years, with approximately 18 employees. The company has planted many pine trees, Australian gum trees, hibiscus trees, and other trees and flowers on the island. The pine trees and gum trees are already up to 50 feet tall. Pan Pacific Airlines will now station approximately 18 employees on the island, so the total population on the island will be about 35 people. Currently, there is only one woman. The current supervisors of the Pacific Commercial Cable Company's Honolulu branch, Mr. Frazer and Mr. McMichael, brought two donkeys, one male and one female, to the island in 1904 when they were working on Midway Island for recreational riding during their spare time. A few years later, they were transferred to the nearby East Island branch. These two donkeys, along with some small donkeys, and a lot of food, were taken along. They dug a well on the island to provide drinking water for the donkeys, but the donkeys refused to drink the well water. They dug a pool in the sand a little further from the beach with their hooves and drank the black water inside. The donkeys initially relied on the leaves of the trees on the island for food, but before long, the trees were plagued by insects and withered. As a result, more than 20 donkeys died, leaving only three.</p>
<p>Every autumn, a large number of sooty terns fly from the Aleutian Islands to Midway Island to spend the winter, divided into black and white varieties. We only saw many black ones, and the white ones will fly in a little later. Each female tern digs a nest in the sand, lays a very large egg in the nest, and incubates the egg until the chick hatches before leaving. Then both male and female terns feed the chick, guarding it very carefully. When the chick is able to move a few feet away from the nest, the terns will no longer feed it. When building the hotel on the island, the trucks transporting materials moved many chicks away and marked the nests, putting the chicks back in the nests after the trucks passed to prevent them from starving to death.</p>
<p>At 6:10 AM on November 2nd, we departed from Midway Island and flew 1304 miles before arriving in Honolulu at 5:12 PM, landing at Pearl Harbor. This was the most interesting leg of the entire journey. The islands along the way stretched endlessly, green and dazzling. Several islands were about 200 feet above sea level. The loveliest scenery of the entire trip was looking down from the plane at a distance of one or two miles and seeing the shadow of the plane, like a big bird, flying in the clouds, surrounded by a circular, beautiful rainbow. At noon on November 18th, I departed from Honolulu, flew to Alameda on the morning of the 19th, departed again at noon, and landed safely in Dallas at 5:00 PM, completing the round-the-world flight. I can be considered the first person to travel around the world by commercial airplane. The entire journey was 26,080 miles, and excluding the cost of living in the East for five months, the total travel expenses were US$3,355. The actual flying time was 16 days.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Bowing Diplomacy</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>According to yesterday's report, at the general meeting of the House of Representatives the day before yesterday, the congressmen successively questioned the government, and the most valuable questioning was that of Mr. Ozaki Yukio, an old Japanese politician. His expressions regarding military reduction and diplomacy were direct and incisive, and those who listened were moved. The second was the questioning speech of Nakano Seigo, which lasted for two and a half hours. From the sharp words of their questioning, the cabinet and the military obviously exposed different political views and destructive rifts, but how the two sides will win or lose in the end remains to be seen in the next episode.</p>
<p>What I want to talk about here are a few very novel statements in Nakano Seigo's speech, which I will highlight. He said that Foreign Minister Hayashi Gonsuke's diplomacy, whether towards China or towards the United Kingdom and the United States, uniformly practiced goodwill and bowed in all directions, which could be called bowing diplomacy. However, diplomacy and the sentiment of goodwill are still another issue, and so on. Such words are somewhat understandable and somewhat peculiar. A country's politics naturally has a country's national policy, and a country's diplomacy naturally has a country's policy. Therefore, the diplomatic practices of various countries are only to adhere to their diplomatic objectives, organize their diplomatic steps, and mediate disputes. However, Japan's diplomacy has been constantly innovating, with nothing impossible. According to what has been seen in newspapers recently, there is one-dollar diplomacy, guan dispute diplomacy, duck diplomacy, and now there is so-called bowing diplomacy. However, I do not quite believe in the words "bowing diplomacy." In recent years, Japan has been flaunting its power and ignoring the world. Its arrogance has been so great that countries around the world can only sigh and dare not speak. How could it want to use bowing diplomacy? It is still understandable to use bowing diplomacy towards the United Kingdom and the United States, but how could it also use bowing diplomacy towards China? It is truly outrageous.</p>
<p>However, since bowing diplomacy is used, it should lead to the result of goodwill. Why does he also say that diplomacy and the sentiment of goodwill are still another issue? Then even if one bows completely, one will not get the result of goodwill. What is the reason for this? However, on the one hand, they keep bowing, and on the other hand, they keep implementing their cannon policy. Therefore, the more they bow, the more they feel the sentiment is getting worse. However, I believe that Nakano Seigo's so-called bowing diplomacy is not aimed at foreign countries, but at domestic affairs. The opinions of the Japanese political groups and the military are becoming more and more disparate, and the contact is becoming more and more serious. The foreign minister is truly in a position of "it's difficult to please everyone." If he respects Party A's wishes, he will clash with Party B. If he respects Party B's wishes, he will clash with Party A. Therefore, Mr. Ozaki Yukio said that the lack of unity in diplomatic policy is the root of the problem. The three ministries of foreign affairs, army, and navy, as well as the personnel stationed in China, each have their own expressions and views. How can they make others believe in Japan? Therefore, Foreign Minister Hayashi Gonsuke's bowing diplomacy is better directed towards both domestic parties rather than towards China, the United Kingdom, and the United States.</p>
<h3>Lantern Festival</h3>
<p>— Tian Qing</p>
<p>Snowflakes danced madly on the grand stage of the universe. The wilderness, fields, buildings, and trees... were all draped in radiant, immaculate coats; yet they also faintly revealed the misery of being unable to resist the invasion of the cold.</p>
<p>Little girl Moujia's thatched hut was covered into a small snow mountain. There were several gaps in the house through which snowflakes drifted in. The weather was so cold that people shivered, but little girl Moujia did not care about this, single-mindedly absorbed in playing with that little lantern; Christmas Eve had been quietly taken away by Father Time, and the lantern had not been lit. Now the Lantern Festival was coming again, but the little lantern was still empty, without a single small candle. Thinking that without a candle, the lantern could not be lit, a layer of light anxiety inevitably seeped into her small, joyful heart. She looked up at her grandmother, wanting to ask her why her grandfather had not returned yet.</p>
<p>For the past two years, the grandmother had often maintained an extraordinary expression: she seemed to be staring at something: yet as if she had not seen anything at all, she remained silent. The wrinkles on her face, worn smooth by life, and the sparse, almost bald temples! etched with the pain of infinite worries and memories.</p>
<p>This kind of incomprehensible stillness melted Moujia's anxious, passionate heart. She quietly lowered her head again to caress her beloved "treasure."</p>
<p>"Why hasn't grandfather returned yet?" The little girl looked at the sky for a while, and couldn't help but ask her grandmother again.</p>
<p>That answer often failed to satisfy Moujia. In fact, she was particularly concerned about her grandfather today, because her grandmother had told her that her grandfather had gone to buy Lantern Festival gifts and small candles for Moujia.</p>
<p>The sky grew darker step by step, and the snowflakes took advantage of the wind's madness, becoming even more violent and powerful, forming enchanting nets in bursts. Old Grandfather still had not returned. The grandmother was even less able to answer Moujia's questions, even muttering to herself in a daze.</p>
<p>——This caused Moujia to have great doubts: "Is it that the snow is too heavy, confusing grandfather's way home?"</p>
<p>Logically, the little girl being so sensible, her longing for her grandfather would make the grandmother happy enough to shed tears. She would pick Moujia up: kiss her wise little eyes, and her dark, shining soft hair, praying to the Bodhisattva to grant Moujia greater and more beautiful blessings. But at this moment, she only shook her head slightly, stubbornly maintaining that dazed silence.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the grandmother knelt on the ground, tremblingly clasping her hands in prayer: "Bodhisattva... God bless</p>

<p>Moujia's old grandfather's safety... May you absolve the souls of Moujia's parents... Grant this poor child greater and more happiness..."</p>
<p>Why was grandmother always praying to the Bodhisattva to absolve the souls of Moujia's parents? The little girl could not understand at all, and the impression of her parents had gradually faded and been forgotten in her memory. However, at this moment, the grandmother's attitude made a little terror arise in her innocent heart, sensing that this would be an unfortunate arrival.</p>
<p>A gust of violent wind, carrying clumps of snowflakes, rudely burst open their door: the grandmother and everything in the house trembled at the same time. But Moujia cried out in joy: "Ah, he's back! Grandfather is back!" The little girl busily ran towards the door, ready to welcome her kind grandfather. When she realized that there was no shadow of anyone there, she closed the door heavily again in disappointment and anger, fretting there.</p>
<p>The sound of firecrackers in the distance, carried in the wind, should be the time when the Bodhisattva descended to the palace: the "lantern parade" should also be about to set off—the drawn-out lantern frame like a wandering dragon, all kinds of beautiful lanterns... A heat surged in the little girl's heart, and she also thought of the excitement of "burning fire clouds" and "burning fire treasures" (a special custom in the countryside, using burning firewood to express prosperity)...</p>
<p>Heavy and urgent knocking interrupted Moujia's fantasy. The little girl did not delay at all, quickly opened the door, letting the sharp cold wind push in her old grandfather.</p>
<p>The old man who came in had strings of snowbells hanging on his clothes, hat, the small cloth bag on his shoulder, and his white beard, emitting a glittering light under the dim light in the house - this made the little girl's sharp inspiration suddenly recall Santa Claus in the church, and she cried out in surprise and jumped over to grab the old man's frozen hand, asking him if he had brought back the small candles.</p>
<p>Only then did the old grandmother awaken and run over, shaking the snowflakes off the old man's face, and at the same time noticing that the small cloth bag on his shoulder, soaked by the snowflakes, was still empty, and a desperate cry resounded deeply in her heart: "Didn't you borrow any food?"</p>
<p>The old grandfather leaned against the door panel with all his might, panting urgently and weakly, his whole body trembling with cold and hunger. Moujia was still clamoring for the small candle to light the lantern, because tonight was the Lantern Festival!</p>

<p>Peach blossoms are like embroidery, willows are like gold. Zhang Xu invites Liu Yi to go. Both have talent and beauty. They were classmates and from the same hometown. Strolling together to find poetic verses. Walking leisurely near the seaside. Seeing a. Shepherdess with a look of sorrow. Shy away from others and frightened when seeing people. The clothes are not like ordinary women. A kind of elegance and charm is wonderful. Bored, ask the charming lady. What family background might you try to say? The charming appearance is not like a shepherd. Hiding her shyness, she picks up her robe and says softly. The whisper is like a nightingale coming out of the valley. Because my father is angry. Today I ask to send a message. The rhinoceros hairpin on my head can be used as proof. The big tree by the river can be the door. As directed and as described. There is indeed a shade of a big tree by the river. Lightly knock a few times. I did not know that this hairpin was made of rhinoceros horn. In an instant, it can separate the sea water. Crystal palace, glazed throne. See the crown-wearing person on the throne. The emperor was shocked and angry. Since this is the case, how can I allow it? Discussing marriage does not hinder the separation of the underworld. The croaking of the alligator drum is a harmonious sound. Entering the Dragon Palace before Dongting Lake.</p>

<p>The "Street Angel," directed and written by Yuan Muzhi, entirely depicts the lifestyles of the lower classes in a large city, such as barbers, news vendors, wind instrumentalists, musicians, prostitutes, madams...etc., a wide variety, forming a grand spectacle. It is a comedy with an original new style of domestic film.</p>
<p>The "Crossroads," directed and written by Shen Xiling, has been completely finished and passed by the Nanjing Film Censorship Board. It depicts the trilogy of modern youth's lack of education, love, and employment. The plot is deeply touching, and the director's achievement is particularly good. There is a famous song "In Spring" in it, which is full of Eastern folk song sentiment and is extremely moving. The lyrics are a collaboration between Guan Lu and He Luting, and the music is composed by He Luting.</p>
<p>"Dreams of the World," a collaboration between Cheng Bugao and Tan Ying again, is scheduled to start filming within a week. The script is by the famous playwright Professor Hong Shen. The plot is novel and vivid, writing about the different dreams that the men, women, masters, and servants in a large family have on the winter solstice night. The script has been reviewed and approved by the central government and has received praise.</p>
<p>"Vigorous Dragon and Lively Tiger," directed and written by Xu Xin, has recently been completed. The final scene of the great battle between the police and bandits involved requesting the local garrison in Suzhou to participate in the performance. All guns and cannons were fired with live ammunition, making it extremely tense and adding a lot of color to the film.</p>
<h3>A Scene from "Street Singing"</h3>
<h3>Minxin News</h3>
<p>Mrs. Chen Danyi, the wife of Jin Qingyu, gave birth to a daughter in Nanjing. Jin took advantage of his free time to rush to Nanjing to offer his condolences.</p>
<p>Wang Guilin's attitude towards acting has always been serious and never slackened. His previous films such as "Humanity" and "City Night" have long been praised by society. Recently, the role he played in "New Humanity" is a re-enactment, so he is even more serious. Therefore, there is no doubt that his performance will be outstanding.</p>
<p>In recent days, "New Humanity" is filming scenes of famine and starvation, with people cooking and eating grass roots. Because Lin Chuchu, Li Keng, Li Xi, Wang Guilin, and others played it, the tragic scene made the spectators on the spot feel touched and shed tears.</p>
<p>In the scene of "New Humanity" filming in a hotel, Hu Rong and Dai Yanwan fought for Liang Saizhu. Hu Rong originally had the upper hand, punching Dai Yanwan so hard that he was dizzy and his fingers were also cut. But in the blink of an eye, Liang Saizhu slapped Hu Rong in the face. Although it was acting, it was a completely serious way of fighting. Fighting for a woman should be called a combination of soft and hard performance.</p>
<h3>"Resurrection" to Be Brought to the Screen</h3>
<p>Tolstoy's "Resurrection" is a world-renowned masterpiece, an immortal masterpiece. In foreign countries, many famous novels have been brought to the screen, and "Resurrection" is no exception. "Resurrection" has even set a new record, having been filmed four times before.</p>
<p>Now, Tianyi director Zuo Ming is burying himself in writing the script for "Resurrection." As soon as it is completed, it will be sent to Beijing for review.</p>
