<h3>省察過去與努力將來</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>國府林主席。於日昨舉行奠都十週紀念時。曾有周詳演辭發表。對十年來民生建設。就衣食住行四方面。撮其工作之大要。曲蓋報道之責任。語長心重。娓娓動聽。而其措辭步驟。開端於省察過去。屬望於努力將來。尤暗示吾人於日常生活中。實無時不應檢點自身之行動。亦無時不應鞭策進取之精神。蓋唯內省。乃能明是非之向背。而求其改善。唯前瞻。乃能察時代之動態。而知所把握。主席微妙之啟示。吾人又烏可以不省。</p>
<p>就林主席所列舉之十年來政府工作成續。如農業技衛之改進。農村經濟之救濟。靠桑棉產之改良。建築材料之提倡。均已憑藉統制之效能。予以有力之推動。而交通方面。於短短十年間。竟能修棄二千七百五十四公里之鐵道部份。完成十萬九千七百四十九公里之公路建設。尤足稱為顯著之進展。至首都輪渡反連雲港之落成。錢塘江大鐵橋之興築。旣非輕易之工事。咸能應時而產生。亦有值得大書而特書者。凡此皆為事寶所表現。足予世人以共瞻。在政府固為盡其分內之責任。在人民卻應致其深切之感謝。更就整個國家言之。十年回首。風景不殊。而六載以來。創鉅痛殷。領十被侵。主權日削。蠶食鯨吞。野心未艾。視耽欲逐。憑陵方深。全國上下。誠應椎心腐齒。齊志協調。以共措邦邑於安寧。謀版圖之恢復。奈何猶多分戶立幟。儘圖私便。因循苟且。祇顧目前。此則為吾全國民所應省察之對象。而决不願輕諉其責任於一方。</p>
<p>一國民族性之不能無缺失。原亦事竇之所難諱。端宜藉省察之所得。圖隨時之改進。吾人以為今後自處之道。卑之無甚高論。惟有暫黜小己。圖伸大我。戒除虛憍。力趨平實而已。誠能遏絕自私之圖營。各就本位而努力。則事無不可為者。－切眞實價值之估計。不在於矜新騖遠。眩一時之耳目。而在於靜心壹志。作埋頭之苦幹。不在於舖張揚厲。恣口頭之宣傳。而在於切貿運行。以績效為憑徵。其在主持設施之人。固不應執著成見。自陷於錮蔽。亦未便廣徇人意。築室而道謀頭腦應求清晰。判斷務往審愼自信宜具把握。執行貴有毅力。以刻苦為前提。以沉著為依歸。以團結為目標。以內省為繩察。自政府中人以迄地方保甲。若均能注意及此。底厲從事。則民生建設。自益精進。剝復之兆。儻亦在斯。</p>

<p>三度罷工發生經過</p>
<p>英商電車公司車務部開車賣票全體工人二千二百餘人、因感物價高漲、原有工資、難維生計、於本年一月間、提出十項條件、要求公司予以接受、但公司當時未有表示、故開車賣票全體工人、於本年二月十日、（廢曆去年十二月二十八日）宣告聯合罷工、旋卽具呈黨政機關請求援助、市黨部•社會局•總工會•等據呈後、以電車關係公共交通、故卽派員勸導工人、先行復工、要求條件、進行設法調處、當經决定待過辦法五項、旋至三月三日、靜安寺路、匯山路•倍開爾路•三機廠全部工人、因廠方無故開除工人兩名、亦聯合罷工、因公司拒絕兩工人復工、故相持三日、旋車務部全體工人響應罷工、致電車又告停駛、幸經黨政機關調處迅速、會銜布告、限令一律復工、當時工方提出三項絛件、但公司祇接受一項、其他兩項並未談判、該廠工人認為公司、無誠意接受要求、乃聯合發起組織工會、要求公司簽訂團體勞資協約、但經黨政調解無效、故復於本月十八日晨起、車務機務全體工人三千二百餘名、聯合宣告罷工、以促資方覺悟、</p>
<p>工方發表工潮眞相</p>
<p>大公社記者昨晤電車工人罷工委員會委員、發表此次罷工經過、據謂外界對讓車工人罷工、表示有責難之意、但工人之罷工、寶受環境所壓迫、不得已而發生、關於本公司全體工人待遇、較之華商法商兩電車工人、待遇惡劣、如華商法商、對賣票工人、有銅版賞及獎金等、同時例假及星期休息、均有工資、而英商則並無是項待遇、第二次發生罷工時、曾提出三項條件、㊀退職金問題、㊁工人疾病時、應給工資問題、㊂開除兩工人理由問題、該三項條件、均已呈報黨政機關、認為頗有理由、並經市黨部委員陸京士、召集該公司華買辦胡子輿前往談話、當由陸氏通知胡君、轉向公司大班伊文氏提出、詎胡君祇向大班提出退職金問題、對疾病工資等問題、均未向伊文報告、致黨政機關代表前往調解時、該伊文推諉不知、不允談判、其中責任、應由胡君負責、而此次所提五項條件、其中卽為第二次工人所提、未列入談話之條件、但伊文祇接受原則、不允談判、其中不知如何用意現電車公司全體工人、每日做工則有工資、如患病卽無工資、但人豈能担保不患病、如果患病、經濟無着、依何生存、故所提之條件、在人情法理、均為正當、但罷工亦非所願、實受不得已之壓迫、現工潮旣起、亟盼資方誠意談判、否則决不復工、但電車關係公共交　、對旅客深感萬分抱歉云云、</p>
<p>公司將招失業替代</p>

<p>工人組糾察維持隊</p>
<p>該公司全體罷工人五干三百餘名、對此次工潮、已抱定非達到要求目的、决不復工、但為防範公司、另招失業、或白俄替代工作、故已組織糾察隊•維持隊各二十隊、每隊十人、負賣派往倍開爾路•匯山路•靜安寺路•各廠門工作、以防新工人入廠工作、故如果公司另招新工、則難免發生紛擾云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>如何方能完成普遍的裁軍？</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>美國紐約新歷史社，最近一為引起人類明瞭現代重大責任，卽在戰爭未毀滅人類以前，從事於毀滅戰爭，－特舉辦“世界論文獎金，”請各國人士，參加競賽，以求普遍討論，共同裁決。此舉呵謂極有意義。題為：“世界人類如何方能完成普遍的裁軍？”確是消強戰爭的大問題。然而便因問題重大，故解決也不容易。</p>
<p>文章要做，是大可發揮的。我們可以籲請世界各國，彼此放棄侵略野心，打開對立形勢，繼續軍縮會議工作，實行裁軍。如此立論，話自然不錯，皆屬正義。但是辦得到嗎？軍縮會議，過去何嘗不滿最大的努力？只因各國參加討論，不但毫無誠意，甚且鈎心鬥角，單砲口一项，甲主張十四时，乙堅持十六吋，致结果鬧成僵局，军缩反變為軍擴。目前各國都在致全力於建艦造機。可見呌列強實行裁軍，無異與虎謀皮。</p>
<p>然而方法果窮嗎？我一想辦法不會沒有的，現在的事，不怕沒有辦法，祇怕有辦法而不能實行，則有辦法等於無辦法，中國人本來有句話，呌“紙上談兵”這句話就是說這種只能談而不能用，還是不談的好，但是此項“世界論文獎金，“已向各國人士開始徵求。競賽不受任何限制，論文可以用各國文字寫作。屆時鴻篇偉著，兼收並蓄，成績必大有可觀。至於各人所提出的方案，是否能完成普遍的裁軍？自然也是疑問。不過－各別安全的信念，已告失敗，而共同關切制度的形成，當屬不遠。”我們為促其早日實現，舉行一次徵文，可以藉此機會，測騐各國人民，對於世界大局所抱的態度。</p>
<p>最後我向各國人民問：我們是想坐待戰爭來毀滅人類？還是要在戰爭未毀減人類以前，一致起來毀滅戰爭？</p>
<h3>大喜全龍廟</h3>
<p>— 張海</p>
<p>睡得正香甜，突然廟裏響起了尖銳的螺聲；忽吹忽停，使我們這陌生的旅人有些驚奇了。起來，找去問－個年老的喇嘛，他說這是廟中的號令，頭三次催人起床，後三次召集喇嘛唸經，一年到頭是這樣，沒有改變沒有間斷。正如喇嘛的麻木的平淡的生活一樣。整個的內蒙古大平原就是麻木的。</p>
<p>吃過早點，太陽已經越過樹林普照着大地。於是我們走進一喇嘛家去瞧瞧。從上牆的大門進去，裏邊院子是那麼寬敝，清凈。蒙古包在院子的盡頭，像個受驚的野兔伏在那裏預備逃跑似的。包中靜寂無聲，一個披袈裟的喇嘛端端正正的坐在佛桌前，眼合着，一點也沒為我們的走進所動。佛桌上面有兩座小佛龕，龕裏有小銅佛，前面擺着列小銅杯，整整齊齊的杯裏的茶還冒熱汽。古舊的藏文經和蒙文“萬年歷書”上面滿是灰塵，似乎有幾年沒有動過最後我才注意了那美麗的地毯，古代式的花紋幾乎使我不敢相信是出於蒙古人之手。－切都足以證明這喇嘛是度着舒適優越的生活。喇嘛們除了誦經之外，什麽都不曉得，什麽都不做，－切都聽命於佛。末了找們要求他派人引導找們去参觀“東廟。”—大喜全龍廟—他毫不遲疑的答應了，還給我們三輛大車坐着去。車完全是一甘肅式的大概是“甘肅毛目縣）的木匠做的。</p>
<p>“大喜全龍廟﹂是貝勒府的第一大廟。巍峨矗立在碧綠的原野上。這兒是多麼諍寂呀！沒有角聲，沒有牲畜的號呌。在蔚藍的長空和廣闊的平原中把我們顯得渺小而又渺小。但我覺得很自由，新鮮的空氣給了我們無限的愉快。</p>
<p>廟的建築，半中國式半西洋式的。朝東面是山門，佛殿靠在西正面。這廟宇怎麼竟像洋樓，那些層窗子，外表看來．點也不能使人有肅然之感。進去才知道只有一層樓·天板上畫着許多圓形罩着下垂的黄色綢布，大傘形的，周圍還掛着飄帶。屋裏正中有個三尺多高的座位，舖着黃緞墊子，前有欄桿，後有屏風，頂上罩着覆蓋，是方形的花緞，赤金色的垂帶拉搭着。此位是“呼圖克圖”（活佛）來時坐的。左邊靠前一點，依柱又有一位子，朝南，舖着蓋墊，是貝勒的坐處。同樣的右邊也有一座，向南，此座為“大喇嘛。”前面地板上有兩列坐位，給僧衆坐的。大坐之右有一大桌，上供銅佛，壁上懸着无数佛像，墻角有一乘轎子，完全同前清大官所乘的轎子－樣。據說，每年一次銅佛乘坐，數人抬之，轉廟一周，抬的人可以免災去疾。又有日照傘，大鼓大號等等。都是每年特別大會時用的。再進一室，靠牆有許多玻璃櫃，裝着很多很多的大小銅佛，有的高至數尺，有的小到二寸三寸。另外兩櫃藏着“金剛經二百二十部，尚有其他經典統用黃布包着。還有一佛龕，佛像頗似行膏像，前供八行銅盂，裏面盛的東西各有不同：左第一行係炒麵製成，尖形，供佛吃的。第二行清水，供佛嗽口。第三行藏香，給佛鼻嗅。中夾幾個小羊油燈，使佛目明。第四行雪蓮，並有其他花形，備佛美觀。此外如茶水，點心，都應有盡有，眞呌人發笑。喇嘛們從牧民身上剝削來的，都花在這無謂的用途上。</p>
<p>到樓上，前面是平台，有鐘式銅件二尺來高，中有銅輸高三尺多。另外有獨角獸，馬耳羊尾，不知是什麼獸。平台後樓，有各種銅佛和佛像。銅佛中有“歡喜佛，”男女裸體擁抱，渾身一絲不掛。下樓時經過偏門，有一木轉輪，高五六尺，上面掛着小鈴，輸上有－棒，每轉一週，鈴響一次。兩廊壁上繪着四大金剛。窗，門，梁，柱，都是五色油彩，有金色的印度字，我們路上所見的蒙古人的居住非常簡單，而廟里却如此富麗堂皇，眞是意想不到。據這廟是清朝未年建造，所以到現在還瑰麗堅固。</p>
<p>廟旁有一蒙古包形的木屋，外面是土牆，周回有十幾個窗，喇嘛二三十人在裏面唸經，穿紅衣披紅布，口中喃喃。喇嘛中竟也有十一二歲的孩子當小喇嘛，把青年的光陰葬送在跪拜唸經之中，實是可憐可惜！屋內有大銅塔，二尺高，外貼金，內係活佛高僧的遺骸灰，上有赤金美玉等花形物，價值很大。</p>
<p>嘲嘛們每天唸經：上午兩次，清早一次，十一時一次，唸時打大鼓，搖小鼓，吹喇叭，打銅鼓，搖鈴，用孔雀羽洒水。</p>
<p>離開大喜全龍廟時我們深深的嘆息着蒙古人的麻木生活。</p>
<h3>買票</h3>
<p>— 馬夢塵作</p>
<h3>偶感</h3>
<p>— 潛一</p>
<p>最後的人情之出賣</p>
<p>前個月裏，差不多間天要到四馬路去一次，想買一點幾個書店廉價的書。因而在開明書店門口那一段階沿上，常常遇着手上拿着一封信的男人。</p>
<p>這個人約莫四十來歲，衣服雖襤褸一點，談吐還不很土俗，滿臉青白的顏色，像一個吃鴉片的人。他手上拿的是那種一個銅元兩只的中國式信封，面上寫着：“煩交曹家渡某處某先生”的字樣。左邊落的却是“遼寗××寄”的款式。</p>
<p>他在階沿上行着，看见有人迎面而來，便很有禮地把信遞到你的面前：</p>
<p>“请問先生：曹家渡往那裏去？”</p>
<p>在你還沒有告訴他完的時候，他的話又來了：</p>
<p>“先生：我是從遼寗來的，可憐見地此處舉目無親，腰無半文，……您可不可以借幾角錢給我做車錢？……”</p>
<p>這麼一來，他的來意就很明顯了。而且，天天在那個地方，他總縫表演着同樣的劇本，多遇着幾次的人，因也更懂得他的本事了。</p>
<p>連人類最後餘存下來的同情也給出賣了。——不禁心裏這般嘆息着。</p>
<p>在我們這個商品支配一切的社會裏，究竟要到什麼地方才可以發掘得出－絲絲眞實的人性呢？而又有誰能夠流露出一點點他自己的眞實的情感呢？</p>
<h3>街頭小事</h3>
<p>— 石竹</p>
<p>老吳用皮鞋挪了一步。說：</p>
<p>“走吧，這有什麼好看？”</p>
<p>但是我還用頭夾在人叢中，仰起下巴，看這天神似看巡捕到底要將這拾垃圾的窮鬼怎麼樣？</p>
<p>天神左手摸住屁股後的手槍，另隻手裏的木棍指着窮看鼻子，命他到捕房裏去。</p>
<p>窮鬼偏不識相，縮手縮脚地蹲在那兒，望望他，望望身上的爛衣服，手中的籃子，鐵鉗。</p>
<p>天神知道非顯出神通放眞本事不足短期實現“於是快刀斬亂痲的只消用棍砸了幾下，窮鬼果然哎喲”！姆媽哎喲：老爺”的吃不消，但他把身子更縮小些，一團牛糞似的坐在地上。</p>
<p>這雙簧的鬧劇使觀衆們全笑了。我想表示服從大多數也笑一笑，可是張開了嘴笑不出。</p>
<p>戴瓜皮帽的胖子告訴我：</p>
<p>“這傢伙垃圾不拾，爬上窓戶偸東西，被捕巡捉了。”</p>
<p>笨賊！怎麼白天能夠偸呢。我心裏罵他。</p>
<p>“豬玀還不滾！”天神用力地再來幾下。</p>
<p>“老爺！我眞……請……·”</p>
<p>天神皺皺眉頭，就拖着破衣走；衣撕碎了，拖着籃子走。觀衆們見窮鬼眼眶裏的眼淚欲流出來的樣子，又有些在笑了。</p>
<p>老吳也牽扯着我的長衫要我走，一如巡捕拖窮鬼似的。</p>
<p>劇是演完了，觀衆們也滿足的散去。但有些像有餘味似地邊走邊談的助助餘興：</p>
<p>“唉，好人不做偏做賊，𤻋三眞是天生的。”一位穿馬褂的老人搖搖頭十分慨然地。</p>
<p>“賊，頂好辦法只有打！那位戴瓜皮帽的胖子先生附和着老人來一個定理。摸摸肚皮。</p>
<p>“造孽也很造孽……”</p>
<p>“這是不幹正事的傢伙。”</p>
<p>一對學生式的少年夫妻—或者是情人吧—在掩着鼻子嘟噥着。</p>
<p>可是有黃包车夫在罵巡捕：</p>
<p>“簇儂娘個×！”</p>
<p>有幾個小孩子在說：</p>
<p>“巡捕頂壞啦！”</p>

<h3>Kawagoe's Farewell Visit to Foreign Minister Wang</h3>
<p>He Personally Expressed His Farewell Intentions and Prepared to Return Home. Gao Zongwu Hosted a Banquet Yesterday to Bid Him Farewell.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe will return to his country to report on his duties. On the afternoon of the 19th, at 4 p.m., he visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to express his farewell intentions. The conversation lasted for half an hour before he departed. He is scheduled to attend Foreign Minister Wang's banquet for various foreign envoys on the evening of the 20th and will depart for Shanghai on the 23rd. After meeting with Japanese representatives there, he will directly take a ship from Shanghai to Japan. During his absence, the embassy affairs will be temporarily handled by Japanese representatives. (19th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe Shigeru is scheduled to take the special express train from Nanjing to Shanghai at 7:50 a.m. on the 22nd, staying in Shanghai for a short period. He will return to his country on a ship on May 2nd. He plans not to visit Nanjing again before his return. On the afternoon of the 19th, at 4 p.m., Kawagoe, accompanied by Secretary Shimizu, visited Foreign Minister Wang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to bid farewell. According to Secretary Shimizu after their return, Foreign Minister Wang inquired in detail about the results of the Japanese Diet's reshuffle and also asked about the "six points" proposal to the Japanese Standing Bureau rumored by the Asahi Shimbun regarding Ambassador Kawagoe's return. Ambassador Kawagoe replied that this was just speculation by the newspaper's Nanjing correspondent. On the evening of the 19th at 8 p.m., Gao Zongwu, Director of the Asian Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, hosted a banquet to bid farewell to Kawagoe, also inviting Secretary Shimizu and Fukui, the Consul-General in Nanjing, to attend.

<h3>Kawai's Impressions of China After Being Transferred Back to His Country</h3>
<p>Sino-Japanese Political Relations Should Be Adjusted</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Former Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Kawai Tatsuo, has been transferred back to his country and assumed the position of Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He arrived in Tokyo at 8 a.m. today (19th). According to reports, if the genuine promotion of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is to be realized, the National Government of China should be the counterpart. Therefore, the political relationship between the two countries should not only be taken into consideration but also actively adjusted. Kawai continued to state his impressions of China, strongly stating the concentration of China's economic institutions and the National Government of China's increased control over the monetary system and industry. He concluded that Japan should establish a supreme and unwavering policy towards China. Former Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tanehide Eiji, is currently preparing to hand over his duties at the end of the month.

<p>[Tokyo] Consul-General in Shanghai, Kawai Tatsuo, has returned to his country from Shanghai due to his promotion to Director of the Information Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arriving in Tokyo at 8 a.m. on the 19th. Kawai told reporters in the car that the development of China's economy has been quite slow in the past, but recently, the national economy has developed, and the Chinese government directly and indirectly controls the overall control over its economic organization. This is a fact that we should fully recognize. The Chinese government also has direct control over the financial sector and important industries, and trade is gradually being brought under state management. As for other economic organizations, the government's indirect control is gradually strengthening within them. Therefore, to achieve genuine Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, it is essential to deal with the Chinese government. Therefore, political problems between China and Japan should not only not be abandoned but should also be actively adjusted in the future. For this purpose, it is essential that the Japanese government establish an immutable supreme policy in the shortest possible time. (19th, Domei Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Issue of Abolishing the Puppet Organization in Eastern Hebei</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese People Have Been Talking a Lot About This Case - Chi Tsung-mo's Trip to the East is to Request Its Maintenance</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Recently, discussions here regarding China's Mingye Jun's desire to abolish the puppet organization in eastern Hebei have been widespread. Local newspapers have also prominently published Kodama Kenji's recent proposal to Foreign Minister Sato Naotake and the message from Ambassador to China Kawagoe Shigeru urging the Japanese government to resolve the North China issue. All of these facts have caused deep anxiety among all parties particularly related to the existence of the aforementioned puppet organization. Recently, local small newspapers have frequently published lengthy propaganda texts defending the puppet organization. Chi Tsung-mo was sent to Japan yesterday, and the local newspapers directly acknowledged that the purpose was to ask the Japanese side to maintain the status quo in eastern Hebei. Yesterday, Yin Rugeng published a lengthy statement to the Japanese newspapers, and the newspapers here prominently published it. It is generally believed that it is an important way of expressing anxiety. This morning, the reporter specifically questioned the spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on this issue, who said, "The establishment of the Eastern Hebei organization is fundamentally a Chinese domestic issue. As for Yin Rugeng's mention that some Japanese people are currently engaged in mediating the abolition of the organization, it is not true." The reporter then asked whether Japan would not send troops to support it if China took effective measures to deal with the issue on its own initiative. The spokesperson replied that Japan would not turn a blind eye if the security of Manchuria was threatened as a result. When the reporter finally pointed out that the Tanggu Truce Agreement also stated that the Chinese government had the right to send 5,000 armed troops to the twenty counties of eastern Hebei as security forces and did not allow Japanese troops to be stationed there, the spokesperson said that if China acted in accordance with the existing agreement, there would be no reason to stop it. He continued, "Japan has sent troops to Shandong and Shanghai when it felt it was necessary. You should know about that." (Central News Agency Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] In order to implement its policy of fooling the people, the puppet government of eastern Hebei has issued a special order to all counties in eastern Hebei to ban books related to party principles and ordered them to be completely destroyed.

<h3>Two Memorial Weeks at the Central Government</h3>

Chairman Lin presided over the ceremony and led the ceremony. He also gave a detailed report on his recent inspection of Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, and other provinces and the progress of general construction in each province. The meeting adjourned at 9:40. (19th, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held a memorial week at 10 a.m. on the 19th. Wang Chonghui, Li Wenfan, Chen Daqi, Chen Xunyong, Chen Jiliang, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, Chen Qicai, and other officials from the National Government and various ministries and commissions, totaling about 400 people, attended. In addition, Wang Yongbin and ten others who were sworn into office at the government this morning also participated. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he gave a report, which concluded at 11 a.m. The original text of Chairman Lin's report is as follows:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I have been away from Beijing for nearly a month now for the purpose of visiting Guangdong to pay tribute to the Tomb of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang and inspecting the provinces along the way. All the impressions I have gained from this trip are extremely satisfactory. The progress of construction projects in various provinces and the hard work of local officials sufficiently demonstrate that the Chinese nation possesses a hidden new life and new power for revival, which should not be underestimated. This is what makes me feel extremely gratified. As for the sincere hospitality of the provincial officials and the warm welcome of the local people, I am truly ashamed to accept it. However, I can indirectly see the enthusiasm of the provinces in supporting the central government. There is no gap between the local and the central government, showing that China is indeed a truly unified and organized country. This is the most satisfactory and significant thing I want to report to the central government. My first impression of this trip to Guangdong is the completion of the Yuehan Railway. Before the completion of the Yuehan Railway, transportation between the central government and the southwest relied on sea transport. Now that the Yuehan Railway is completed and the north and south are connected, it will not only bring great progress in political, economic, and cultural aspects but also avoid blockades and threats in national defense. The Yuehan Railway is 681 miles long, and the value of its construction is estimated by the Ministry of Railways to be approximately 175 million Chinese yuan. It has been 38 years since the road was automatically discussed until its recent completion, which shows that it is not easy to complete major national construction projects. How should we cherish and love it? Secondly, from the completion of the Yuehan Railway, we can know that the development of railway transportation is indeed related to the lifeline of the country and is the hub for the progress of all national construction projects. We can also think of the national railway system hand-determined by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, whose vision is far-reaching and planning is thorough, all of which are unmatched. We should follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's plan, adapt to the times, carefully consider the urgency and priority, and gradually seek its realization. In recent years, the Ministry of Railways has been actively designing and constructing national railways. I believe that if domestic politics are stable for a long time, the construction of China's railways will definitely have amazing development within ten years. My second impression of this trip to Guangdong to pay tribute to the martyrs of Huanghuagang is that I feel that the death of an individual can be heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather, and I feel the hardship and difficulty of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution and entrepreneurship even more. The March 29th Uprising in Guangzhou was when the martyrs of our party continued to launch a revolution in Guangzhou under the orders of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, but unfortunately it failed, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs for the country and the nation. Although the event failed, it shocked the national revolutionary sentiment from then on, and soon there was the success of the Xinhai Revolution in Hubei Province. Therefore, the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs can be said to be the birth mother of the Republic of China, the eve of a painful labor. This is the most important and glorious page in the history of the Chinese revolution. Although the bodies of these martyrs have been sacrificed, their immortal spirit and glory will forever remain in the sky and the earth, the same immortality. It can be said that death is heavier than Mount Tai. Before the sacrifice of the Huanghuagang martyrs, there were also the four martyrs of Honghuagang and martyr Shi Jianru, etc. I paid tribute to them all. In addition, I also paid tribute to predecessors such as the late Chairman Hu. During this national tomb-sweeping festival, we should remember our ancestors and the martyrs and think of the difficulty in creating the Republic of China. How should we comrades and the people of the whole country be inspired and strive? My third impression is that after passing through Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces, I saw the hard work of the local party bureaus in various provinces, the unified cooperation of people from all walks of life, the gradual scientification of administrative management, the efforts to promote the New Life Movement, the thriving of various construction projects, the gradual prosperity of the local national economy, and the gradual perfection of people's organization and training. Compared with the speed of progress in 1927, although it cannot be said to be a thousand miles a day, the vigor of a new atmosphere can be said to have planted a deep and universal foundation for the Chinese national revival movement. With this universal foundation in politics, economy, education, construction, and the organization and training of the people, I feel that it is not difficult to complete the local autonomy plan hand-set by Dr. Sun Yat-sen as soon as possible. If everyone then unifies command, aligns steps, and marches forward under the leadership of the central government, in accordance with the established national policy, it will not be difficult to complete the realization of our party's doctrine, the liberation of the people's suffering, the elimination of national disasters, and the revival of the nation in the shortest period of time. What I have reported today is only a few points. I hope that everyone will continue the glorious history of the revolution by taking the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen as the foundation, and work together to complete the arduous task of saving the country.

<h3>Judgment in the Assassination Attempt on Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen</h3>
<p>Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, and He Boguang All Sentenced to Death; Hu Dahai, Xiang Zhonglin, and Others Sentenced to Imprisonment</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Capital District Court held a trial at 4:00 PM on the 19th to pronounce the verdict on the case involving Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, and others for murder and disturbing the peace in the assassination attempt on Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen. The main points of the judgment are as follows: Yu Likui is sentenced to death for joint continuous attempted murder, with lifelong deprivation of civil rights; he is exempt from prosecution for the part of causing death by negligence and is found not guilty on other charges. Zhang Yuhua and He Boguang are each sentenced to death for joint continuous attempted murder, with lifelong deprivation of civil rights; they are found not guilty on other charges.

One handgun is confiscated. Hu Changping, Zhang Guoping, and Xu Yaoying are found not guilty. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Capital District Court's Criminal Division announced the verdict at 4:00 PM on the 19th in the case of Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, and others for the assassination attempt on Wang Jingwei and Song Ziwen and disturbing the peace. A large crowd of spectators was present. The courtroom was heavily guarded. Presiding Judge Gao Wei𤃒, along with judges Deng Bin蓀 and Li Wenwei, prosecutor Zhang Weidong, and clerk Tu Huaili, arrived on time. They ordered the twelve defendants, Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, He Boguang, Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, Lu Qingqi, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, Hu Changping, Zhang Guoping, and Xu Yaoying, to be brought to the court and lined up in two rows. After Gao inquired about each defendant's name, age, place of origin, address, and occupation, he stood up and read the main points of the judgment. When the defendants heard the verdict, those who were not declared innocent looked distressed. Gao then sat down and explained the gist of the judgment, stating that the defendant Yu Likui led his accomplices in Shanghai on July 23rd, 1931 to assassinate Song Ziwen, the former Minister of Finance. Fortunately, he did not hit Song, but he shot and killed Song's secretary, Tang Yulu. Afterwards, he fled to Hong Kong and continued to form an assassination group with Wang Yaqiao and others, recruiting Zhang Yuhua and He Boguang to come to Nanjing to establish the Chenguang News Agency to plot the assassination of important party and government figures. The first attempt was during the Fifth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee on December 5th, 1934, to assassinate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but it failed. The second attempt was in the autumn of 1935, also to assassinate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but it failed. The third attempt was on November 1st, 1935, during the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee, to assassinate Wang Jingwei, the former President of the Executive Yuan, but fortunately, it was not fatal. Therefore, Yu Likui, Zhang Yuhua, and He Boguang were each sentenced to the most severe punishment for joint continuous attempted murder. As for Hu Dahai, Zhou Shiping, Liu Shurong, Lu Qingqi, Xiang Zhonglin, and Li Huaicheng, they were either involved in assassination conspiracies, came to Nanjing from Hong Kong to observe the assassination attempts, or hid the handguns used in the assassination, so they were sentenced according to their respective circumstances. All the reasons for the judgment were based on the testimony of witnesses Lu Jing, Zhao Xinchong, and Wang Renshan, as well as Zhang Yuhua's and He Boguang's previous confessions and their written confessions. Gao also informed the defendants that if they were not satisfied with the judgment, they could file an appeal within ten days of receiving the judgment. He then adjourned the court, and all the defendants were taken back into custody. It is said that Yu Likui, who was sentenced to death, and Hu Dahai and the other nine who were sentenced to imprisonment, all plan to appeal to the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Zhang Yuhua has also hired lawyer Fu Kuanglin as her appeal counsel. The remaining three defendants, Hu Changping, Zhang Guoping, and Xu Yaoying, who were declared innocent, will be released after the appeal period expires and the prosecutor does not appeal.

According to them, this is not the case. Although the Ministry of Railways has recently studied the rectification of railway lines, each railway has its own considerable history and different environment. From a business perspective, there is currently no need to abolish or change the organization of the various railway bureaus. The Zhengtai Railway is a narrow-gauge railway. Through the efforts of the authorities over the years, its business has become extremely developed and its expenses have been reduced day by day. Among the national railways, its achievements are outstanding, and there is no need to merge it with the Pinghan Railway. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Reflecting on the Past and Striving for the Future</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>Chairman Lin of the National Government delivered a detailed speech at the tenth anniversary of the founding of the capital yesterday. He summarized the work of the past decade in the construction of people's livelihood, focusing on the four aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. He covered the major points of the report, and his words were long, heartfelt, and moving. His wording and steps began with reflecting on the past and looking forward to striving for the future. He especially implied that we should always examine our own actions in our daily lives, and we should always spur on the spirit of progress. Only by introspection can we understand the right and wrong, and seek improvement. Only by looking ahead can we observe the trends of the times and know what to grasp. Chairman Lin's subtle enlightenment should not be ignored.</p>
<p>Regarding the achievements of the government's work in the past decade listed by Chairman Lin, such as the improvement of agricultural technology and hygiene, the relief of the rural economy, and the improvement of sericulture and cotton production, all have been effectively promoted through the effectiveness of control. In terms of transportation, the completion of 2,754 kilometers of railway and 109,749 kilometers of highway construction in just ten years can be called a significant advance. The completion of the capital ferry and the port of Lianyungang, and the construction of the Qiantang River Railway Bridge were not easy projects, and they were able to emerge at the right time, which is also worth noting. All of these are concrete achievements that can be seen by the world. The government has fulfilled its responsibilities, and the people should express their deep gratitude. From the perspective of the entire country, the scenery has not changed in the past ten years, but the past six years have been marked by great trauma and pain. Our territory has been invaded, our sovereignty has been eroded, and the ambition of encroachment is unabated. The greed is endless, and the bullying is deepening. The whole country should feel heartbroken and work together to bring peace to the country and restore the territory. Why are there still so many separate factions, each trying to serve its own interests, being passive and only caring about the present? This is what all our people should reflect on, and we are unwilling to lightly shirk responsibility to one side.</p>
<p>It is difficult to deny that a nation's character inevitably has shortcomings. It is important to use the gains from reflection to improve at any time. We believe that the way forward is to temporarily put aside personal interests and strive to promote the greater self, to abandon vanity and arrogance, and to strive for simplicity and practicality. If we can curb selfish plots and each work diligently in our respective positions, then nothing is impossible. The estimation of all true values lies not in flaunting novelty and seeking temporary attention, but in calming the mind and working hard. It lies not in ostentatious publicity and verbal propaganda, but in pragmatic operation with performance as the criterion. Those in charge of facilities should not be attached to preconceived ideas and fall into rigidity, nor should they widely cater to people's opinions. The mind should be clear, judgment should be careful, confidence should be strong, and execution should be resolute. Take hard work as the premise, composure as the basis, unity as the goal, and introspection as the standard. From government officials to local community leaders, if we can all pay attention to this and work hard, then the construction of people's livelihood will become more refined. The signs of recovery may also lie in this.</p>
<h3>Dutch East Indies Actively Strengthens Defense</h3>
<p>And Will Implement Citizen Military Training; More Than 50,000 People Jointly Petition the Government</p>
<p>[Singapore] More than 50,000 people in the Dutch East Indies jointly petitioned the Dutch government, urging it to strengthen the defense of the Dutch colonies in the Far East. It is reported that the Dutch East Indies fleet has only three cruisers, six destroyers, twelve submarines, and several minesweepers. Although the Dutch government has promised to add some submarines, destroyers, and aircraft, the public believes that the number of additions is not enough to prepare for emergencies. According to Singaporean military observers, the remarks made by the former Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Qiang Gejin, are very noteworthy. He said that the Dutch East Indies must always be on alert and must provide valuable support to future allies. There is now a feeling in the Dutch East Indies that the army is strong, but the navy is not. Although the new cruiser Leyte is now stationed in Surabaya, the naval power is still insufficient to guarantee security. The air defense is also questionable, and the naval air combat equipment is even more incomplete. Although many appropriate coastal strongholds have been built for naval aircraft, it is doubtful whether the number of aircraft is sufficient. Twelve new Dornier aircraft will arrive within a few months, each capable of carrying 3,500 pounds of bombs. However, most of these new aircraft will be used for reconnaissance work. The army has recently transported 40 Glenn Martin American aircraft, which are being assembled by the Army Headquarters in Bandung. These aircraft can carry 2,200 pounds and travel between Surabaya and Batavia. These two places are major ports in Java, with a round trip of more than 1,100 miles. American instructors are currently training pilots. Soon, about 40 new Dutch aircraft will also be transported, specifically for aviation training. Citizens of the Dutch East Indies have compulsory military training obligations. Pilots employed in the civilian land aviation industry are now being called into the army air force for three weeks of service. Those enlisted in the army must continue to serve for nine months, and those enlisted in the navy must serve for eighteen months. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)</p>

The Mexican government has also copied this note to the League of Nations for filing. (Havas dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Another Espionage Agency Broken Up in Madrid</h3>
<p>Fifty-Five People Arrested, Said to Be Headed by Italy</p>
<p>⊙Madrid The police searched the residence of "a famous female dressmaker who is very close to the aristocracy" today and arrested fifty-five people, including twelve women and several clergymen, all suspected of espionage. The government then accused Italy of organizing a large-scale espionage agency to seize Madrid and hand it over to the rebel leader Franco. All those arrested had received funds from Italian religious groups, so they were heavily laden with money when they were arrested. The headquarters was in a small hotel in the southwest of the city. This time, they were communicating with the rebels using white light reflection signals, which was detected. After interrogation, if espionage is confirmed, they will probably all be executed.

<h3>British Volunteers Talk About the Difficulty of the Rebels Winning</h3>
<p>Government is Training a Large Army</p>
<p>⊙Gibraltar According to British volunteer Farraday, who arrived here today aboard the British destroyer Galan after being injured in the Spanish war, the Spanish government is now training a newly recruited army, which will soon be able to resist the enemy. Commander Franco of the Nationalist Army believes that the government forces are becoming more united and efficient. He believes that the Nationalist Army cannot invade Madrid, Valencia, or Barcelona. The International Brigade in Alicante includes 1,000 Italians, all of whom are anti-fascists, 1,500 Germans, 5,000 French, 600 British, 700 Americans, 2,000 Russians, 150 Chinese, 300 Japanese, 200 Arabs, and 100 Indians. There are also more than 150 women helping in the Madrid front, mostly of French and Russian nationality. The government air force in Alicante has 300 pursuit aircraft, each equipped with four machine guns, capable of flying 350 miles per hour. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<h3>Confirmation of a British Merchant Ship Breaking Through the Blockade</h3>
<p>Arrived at Gijón, Spain; Labour Party Launches Relief Effort</p>
<p>⊙ From Hengtai: News received here today from the Government forces in Gijón stated that a British destroyer had escorted a merchant ship, breaking through the rebel blockade and entering Spanish territorial waters. It was also reported that three other British destroyers met the cargo ship "Torpo Hall" off the coast of Bilbao and escorted it 140 miles to the port of Gijón. Two destroyers remained outside the port, while the third escorted the cargo ship into the port to a point one mile offshore before departing. (National Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] British cargo ships have repeatedly attempted to break through the Nationalist blockade of the Bay of Biscay, but most have failed. However, the British ship "South Port Hall," weighing 1,200 tons, has successfully broken through the blockade and safely arrived at Gijón, near Santander. The ship's owner sent a telegram instructing the ship to consult with British warships in case of trouble. Meanwhile, the British ship "Mary Lewellin" repeatedly tried to break through the blockade but failed to do so. It has now been ordered to unload its cargo of sweet potatoes in Alicante and then load fruit to sail to Belgium. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>[London] Independent Labour Party Members of Parliament Maxton and Brockway, deeply concerned about the innocent people of Bilbao due to the Spanish Nationalist decision to blockade the port, have launched a fundraising campaign to raise £40,000 to purchase a 4,000-ton cargo ship. This ship would travel between Britain and Bilbao, providing a steady supply of food to the people of the city. They hope to raise the funds by Tuesday so that the ship can leave Britain for Spain on Wednesday. The Valencia government has agreed to protect the ship within three nautical miles of the coast, while the British fleet will provide protection beyond that. The plan has attracted considerable attention, and the Secretary-General of the Independent Labour Party held a press conference today, expressing great optimism about the endeavor. He also stated that Liberal Member of Parliament Robert has expressed his support, and the famous female novelist Maling has generously donated £1,000. He added that the two initiators, Maxton and Brockway, will personally travel on the first voyage to Bilbao. (National Seaborne Telegraph, 18th)</p>
<h3>Canadian Labour Unrest Intensifies Again</h3>
<p>American Auto Workers Insist on Union Recognition</p>
<p>⊙ From Toronto: Unless the dispute between the General Motors Corporation in Oshawa and the local branch of the United Automobile Workers of America is resolved by tomorrow, 100,000 American workers at General Motors of Canada will declare a strike in sympathy. Factories of the General Motors Corporation throughout the United States are also preparing to launch such a sympathetic strike when the leaders of the Oshawa strike announce that they will resolve the dispute themselves without external assistance unless they receive support from American members of the union. However, the Premier of Ontario, Hepburn, who advocates that the dispute be resolved purely by local personnel, has made every effort to prevent outsiders from controlling the Canadian automotive industry. It appeared that the Oshawa strike would be resolved immediately, but after the strike leaders refused to acknowledge any connection with the Committee for Industrial Organization of America, the company refused to negotiate with them, and the situation suddenly changed. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>⊙ From Oshawa: Auto workers here previously requested American counterparts to declare a strike in support. Representatives of the American Committee for Industrial Organization declared today that this is not yet opportune. However, the committee will give unlimited financial aid to the Canadian strikers and their families during the labor unrest. (National Telegraph, 19th)</p>

<h3>The Spanish People Suffer as War Rages for Nine Months</h3>
<p>The Whole Country Plunged into Conflict; International Oversight Plan Fully in Effect</p>
<p>⊙ From Madrid: The Spanish Civil War, which began on July 17 last year in Spanish Morocco in Africa, has now lasted for nine months. The two armies are still locked in a stalemate, with advances and retreats, and countless casualties, exceeding even the deaths in the four years of the American Civil War. At present, the war is still limited to the Iberian Peninsula, but some European politicians and ambitious individuals may escalate the conflict, leading to a larger war. However, international sentiment is now more optimistic. Italy seems willing to withdraw from the vortex, and European countries hope that the United States can mediate, as the democratic country of the New World is the world's largest neutral and stable force, capable of creating peace, resolving disputes, and allowing all countries to save face. (National Reality, 18th)</p>
<p>[London] The Spanish naval and land monitoring plan began to be implemented at midnight today. Twenty-seven countries are participating. This is the first experiment in the world to prevent the expansion of war. The monitoring plan was established after eight months of discussion, with an annual cost of approximately US$4 million, employing 820 monitors and requiring 50 warships. From now on, all foreign arms and volunteers will be prohibited from entering Spain. The second step of the plan will be for all countries to withdraw volunteers from Spain. Italy initially opposed this, but now is willing to submit it to the committee for discussion. (National Telegraph, 19th)</p>
<p>[London] Starting from midnight tonight, the Spanish coast will be monitored by the navies of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany to prevent military personnel and volunteers from entering the country. Land borders will also be guarded by hundreds of monitors. This measure is part of the non-intervention plan jointly established two months ago by twenty-seven countries. All ships entering Spanish territorial waters must first report at designated ports and carry monitors from the Non-Intervention Committee so that they can inspect cargo and ship documents. Warships of various countries are authorized to intercept and verify ship documents. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>⊙ From Hendaye: Fierce battles continue in various places, especially with heavy aircraft activity. Nationalist forces near Madrid recently suffered losses, but they have now amassed large forces, using artillery to bombard the northern side of Carabanchel. There was aerial warfare on the Aragon front, with 15 Nationalist aircraft and 30 Government fighters participating. According to the Nationalist side, seven Government Curtis aircraft were shot down. Government aircraft bombed a Nationalist convoy transporting food to Oviedo. Nationalist forces in the Oviedo area launched a fierce attack on Government positions. According to Nationalist sources, the government, despite fierce counterattacks, abandoned its first and second lines of defense and retreated. Nationalist forces attacked forward with hand grenades, while Asturian miners in the Government forces retaliated with their customary explosives. It is reported that Government forces attempted to attack Santa Quiteria but were repulsed by Nationalist forces. According to Nationalist sources, Nationalist forces occupied several important positions on the Huéscar to Lérida front. In this battle, 257 Government soldiers were killed, mostly French. On the Teruel line northeast of Valencia, Government aircraft are very active, preparing for a large-scale new offensive. Nationalist forces occupy a peninsula-shaped area extending into the sea there, so Government forces plan to cut off road and rail traffic between Teruel and Zaragoza. Government aircraft have flown 150 sorties over enemy territory in this area, bombing and strafing enemy positions. Government forces have recovered three towns more than ten miles outside the railway line and advanced to the Cerro Cota heights near the railway. However, Nationalist sources say that the heights are still in Nationalist hands and that the Government offensive has failed. Nationalist forces reportedly suffered heavy casualties in street fighting in Calanda. According to Nationalist sources, the Government offensives in Villahada and Benaloya have been repulsed, with many casualties. (Reuters from Central News Agency, 18th)</p>

<h3>Hungarian Prime Minister's Speech: No Need for Dictatorial Politics</h3>
<p>Willing to Conclude Agreements with the Little Entente, but Must Recognize Equal Status</p>
<p>⊙ From the Hungarian Capital: Prime Minister Darányi delivered an important political speech in Szeged today, discussing the Hungarian political system and various domestic and foreign policy issues. Recently, the extreme right-wing in Hungary has been very active, advocating for the overthrow of the parliamentary system and the establishment of a dictatorship. Some party leaders of the government faction have also participated in such activities, but other parties in the government faction, such as the Smallholders Party and the Catholic People's Party, advocate for maintaining the parliamentary system and oppose the activities of the extreme right-wing. The two factions are so mutually opposed that Prime Minister Darányi's speech today has attracted widespread attention. Regarding the political system issue, Darányi stated that Hungary neither needs a dictatorship nor a dictator, because Hungary can fully resolve all problems within the framework of the Constitution, and Hungary already has a Regent as the leader of the country. Darányi's words cannot satisfy the extreme right-wing. The same goes for the section on foreign policy. The Prime Minister only mentioned Italy and Austria as Hungary's friendly countries. As for the friendly relations between Hungary and Germany, he only mentioned them when describing the special development of trade between the two countries. In addition, Darányi said that the political and economic agreements concluded between Italy and Yugoslavia are satisfactory. As for the countries of the Little Entente, if they can agree to grant Hungary equal status in law and provide some guarantees for the treatment of ethnic minorities within their borders, then Hungary is also prepared to negotiate and conclude agreements with them. He then discussed the Jewish issue, saying that even if there were no Jews in Hungary, various difficulties would still arise, because Hungary no longer has sufficient funds after implementing the land equalization policy. The so-called Jewish issue is not a social issue, but an economic issue. The proportion of Jews in the Hungarian population is not related to their position in the national economy. Therefore, the immigration of Jews from the East to Hungary should be stopped in the future, and the Jews who have already immigrated to Hungary should be given greater freedom to cooperate with national life. As for demonstrations and disturbances, they are not the way to solve the Jewish issue. Darányi concluded by saying that he is prepared to cooperate with various political parties to maintain order and prevent troublemakers. (Havas from Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<h3>The Polish Situation is Becoming Increasingly Serious</h3>
<p>Labor Unrest Spreads Throughout the Country; Opposition Party Member Killed</p>
<p>⊙ From Warsaw: The wave of strikes throughout Poland is now expanding. 1,500 miners in Upper Silesia demanded a 10-15% wage increase but were unsuccessful and have now gone on strike, threatening to fast. Workers at a large paper mill and paper transport workers in Mistco have also gone on strike. As a result, newspapers in the capital have had to reduce their page size. Textile workers in Aretsdok have been on strike for weeks, with 7,000 participating. In addition, the government continues to arrest members of the opposition People's Party and Socialists, especially in Bullock and Krakowie. (Havas from Central News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>⊙ From Warsaw: The Peasant Party was scheduled to hold a demonstration in Laklaweez city yesterday.

However, after attending a high mass, the Peasant Party members still held the demonstration as planned. Police opened fire and intervened, and one demonstrator was killed, and several were injured. Many others suffered minor skin abrasions. (Havas from Central News Agency, 19th)</p>
<p>⊙ From Warsaw: Public opinion was greatly shocked after the news came out. The authorities prohibited the party's demonstration, citing that communists were taking the opportunity to engage in incitement. Opposition newspapers say that this statement is only aimed at discrediting the opposition parties, causing them to lose public support, and thereby prohibiting all their activities.

<h3>Japanese Cabinet Approves Establishment of Planning Board</h3>
<p>To Replace the Investigation Bureau; Yūki Appointed President</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The key points of the Cabinet Planning Board were decided by the regular cabinet meeting on the 19th. The government will order the two officers, Ōhashi and Kawaigoe, to formulate official regulations based on these key points and submit them to the cabinet meeting within this week for decision. The procedure for consulting the Privy Council will be taken. At the latest, by early May, the candidates for the president, vice president, and other personnel of the board will be selected to realize the plan. The key points of the Planning Board decided by the cabinet meeting today are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) In order to fully develop the functions of the current Cabinet Investigation Bureau and to realize the entity of the national policy integration agency, the Cabinet Investigation Bureau will be reorganized and the Planning Board will be established.</p>
<p>(2) The Planning Board belongs to the management of the Prime Minister and is responsible for the following matters: A. Draft important policies and proposals for their integration and adjustment according to the Prime Minister's instructions, and submit them with reasons. B. Review important policies submitted by various ministers to the cabinet meeting, add opinions, and submit them to the cabinet. C. Investigate important policies and their integration and adjustment. D. Investigate and control the budget of political network policies, add opinions, and submit them to the cabinet.</p>
<p>(3) The Planning Board will have a president, a vice president, about 20 investigators, one secretary, about 15 administrative officials, and about 50 staff members.</p>
<p>(4) The president is selected from among the ministers of various provinces.</p>
<p>(5) In order to maintain liaison with various provinces, in addition to the above-mentioned staff, investigators may be selected from the staff of various provinces.</p>
<p>(6) Appoint participants from those with rich academic knowledge and experience from the private sector.</p>
<p>(7) When necessary, temporarily appoint committee members from those with rich academic knowledge and experience from the private sector and order them to review specific matters.</p>
<p>(8) In order to closely relate to other comprehensive departments and bureaus, the officials of those departments and bureaus may be appointed as standing members.</p>
<p>Central Economic Conference</p>
<p>(1) Establish the Central Economic Conference and order it to review the establishment of comprehensive and fundamental economic policies between domestic and foreign regions, and the determination of basic plans based on fundamental policies.</p>
<p>(2) The president and vice president are held by the Prime Minister and the President of the Planning Board, and the members are appointed from those with rich academic knowledge and experience from the private sector.</p>
<p>(3) When necessary, the secretary may appoint members of the council as temporary members.</p>
<p>(4) The Vice President of the Planning Board is the Secretary-General. (Kyodo News, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The most likely candidate for the President of the newly established Cabinet Planning Board is the Minister of Finance, Yūki. However, some people believe that since the Planning Board has been given the power to review the budget of important policies, making the Minister of Finance the President is tantamount to giving the Minister of Finance the authority above the Prime Minister, and they are advocating against it. However, according to the key points of the Planning Board decided by the cabinet meeting on the 19th, it has been stipulated that the President is an official appointed by the Emperor and is concurrently held by a Minister of State. Therefore, the concurrent appointment of Minister of Finance Yūki is almost certain. As for the candidates for the Vice President, although the call for current Mantetsu Executive Director and Industrial Minister Sakatani Kiichi is very high, it is difficult to realize due to considerable difficulties. Therefore, the theory that former Vice Minister of Finance Kaya Okinori and Vice Director of the Office for Manchurian Affairs Aoki Kazuo will take office is very influential. (Kyodo News, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The problem of establishing a national policy integration agency, which became a pending issue during the Hirota Cabinet, is scheduled to be officially decided by the cabinet meeting on the 19th to specifically realize the Planning Board. The government intends to establish a five-year industrial plan that integrates Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and Taiwan into one entity after the Planning Board is established, with the mission of establishing national industrial policies and integrating the national policies formulated by various provinces. "Manchukuo" already has a five-year industrial development plan with a cost of 3 billion yuan, and part of it has already been started. Korea is also unilaterally implementing a similar plan, and the result will inevitably lead to friction and hinder industrial development. Therefore, the government intends to build the foundation of a Japan-Manchuria economic alliance and establish a permanent national industrial policy that integrates Japan and Manchuria into one entity. In addition, with the development and securing of national defense resources as the center, the integrated promotion of industry will be implemented. The plan is approximately limited to five years, and the industrial plans of "Manchukuo" and Korea are also included. (Kyodo News, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government plans to establish a propaganda agency at the same time as considering the establishment of the Planning Board to publicize the national policies formulated by the Planning Board to the people. Now that the realization of the Planning Board has been decided, the government is determined to establish a propaganda agency as soon as possible. According to Prime Minister Hayashi's opinion, it is planned to expand the current Cabinet Information Committee and strengthen its functions as a pure agency of the Cabinet for propaganda and control of public opinion. The contents of the proposal to establish a propaganda agency, which is currently being studied by the cabinet, are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Expand the current Cabinet Information Committee and strengthen its functions as an agency for propaganda politics and control of public opinion, under the jurisdiction of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>(2) The new propaganda agency will control literature, painting, sculpture, drama, film, records, radio, etc., and general matters related to national culture.</p>
<p>(3) The name of the new propaganda agency is the Cabinet Information Department.</p>
<p>(4) Select talented personnel from the private sector as the director. (Kyodo News, 19th)</p>

<h3>Twenty Million Tons of Smuggled Goods Stockpiled in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin Customs Strives to Register Smuggled Goods and Strictly Blocks Smuggled Goods from Being Transported Out of Tianjin. Smuggling by Japanese and Korean Ronin is Like an Arrow at the End of Its Flight.</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Smuggling by Japanese and Korean ronin is like an arrow at the end of its flight. Since April 10, when the Tianjin Customs began to register smuggled goods in various shops in the city and allow them to pay supplementary taxes according to regulations, the old smuggled goods stored in various shops in the Chinese area have been registered in accordance with the regulations. Unless absolutely necessary or urgently needed for retail sales, they are not purchased. As a result, all smuggled goods companies in the Japanese concessions have almost no sales, and their doors are deserted. Among those who cannot support themselves, as many as seven have closed down in the short period of the past week. Various private consignment companies have tried to form a large alliance to counter the Tianjin Customs' indirect cutting off of private consignment sales channels, but in the end, because their officials could not directly provide assistance, it turned into empty talk. According to Customs investigations, in the past two months, the number of smuggled goods secretly transported from the puppet Eastern Hebei into Tianjin has reached more than 14,000 pieces per day. Last month, there were still 4,000 pieces per day. In the recent three weeks, there have been no more than 200 pieces per day at most. The trend of smuggled goods transported from Yingkou and Dalian to Beidaihe and Changli ports has gradually been cut off. The amount transported from the Eastern Hebei has also decreased by about 90% or more. Because the sales of smuggled goods are not strong, it directly affects the military and political expenses of the puppet Eastern Hebei organization. The salaries of the puppet security teams have been in arrears for two months. Therefore, the puppet organization is actively building the Changping-Shunyi highway, planning to have smuggled goods unloaded at the Daqing River pier, transported to Tangshan, and then transferred to the Changshun highway, passing through Chahar and Suiyuan and sold to the Northwest, as a way to seek survival in desperation. Various smuggled goods companies also know that there is no other way except this, so they have gathered in Tangshan to build warehouses and stacking yards to wait for the completion of the highway and transport goods to various places.</p>
<p>Within this week, the Tianjin Customs has also established two sub-stations in the suburbs of Tianjin, Dayao and Baimiaozi, in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Finance, to strictly block the smuggled goods transported out. Each station has armed security teams patrolling every day to assist in anti-smuggling. Each security team has a share of the bonus for cracking down on smuggling, so they are very diligent. Therefore, the interception is extremely forceful. Even though the ronin have exhausted all methods to seek the smuggling out of the goods in small quantities or in batches, they are intercepted when they reach the suburbs, so in recent days, the outward transportation has been almost completely extinct. The Tianjin Customs' inspection of smuggled goods in various shops in the city is scheduled to end on May 9. Starting on May 10, a city-wide general inspection will be held. Currently, various shops are being registered by their respective trade associations or the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. However, a small number of retail cloth, silk, yarn businesses, and retailers do not quite agree with this move, thinking that since the shops in the various concessions cannot be registered at the same time, the inspection will inevitably be biased and make the Chinese shops suffer losses alone. Recently, Wang Xiaoyan and Wang Wendian, the standing committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, have taken over the matter on behalf of the Chamber of Commerce and plan to ask the Customs to discuss a perfect solution to quell the resentment. As for the Customs' inspection of the shops in the various concessions, it has tried its best, but the authorities of one or two concessions, in order to maintain their tradition or the supreme authority of the concessions and prevent the Chinese from losing their trust in protection, are unwilling to have the Customs take this action within their borders. Therefore, although the Customs has reached an agreement with the authorities of two or three concessions, it is not convenient to proceed immediately. A small number of Chinese businessmen do not understand and have made this request. The Customs estimates that the total amount of smuggled goods in all the concessions and Chinese areas in the city is about 20 million tons. If all are registered and supplementary taxes are paid according to regulations, the Customs can receive more than 30 million yuan in customs duties. The amount is so huge that it can be seen that this time the Customs must first start with the clearance of Tianjin City to get to the root of the problem. (17th)</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Situation in Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>Using Labor as Relief to Prepare for Spring Plowing. Raising 14 Million Yuan for Disaster Relief.</p>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence: The serious drought situation in Sichuan Province is reported in the newspapers day by day. People are very concerned about how the authorities are handling disaster relief work. The reporter went to the Provincial Government to visit Ji Zuyou, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, and asked about the drought situation in Sichuan Province and the general situation of disaster relief handled by the Provincial Government. According to the talk, the drought in Sichuan Province this time, from last summer to the present, can be divided into four periods: one is the disaster since last summer, one is the disaster since last autumn, one is the disaster since last winter, and one is the disaster that has just become a disaster this spring. A total of 128 counties have been affected by the disaster, and the number of victims has reached 35 million, which is truly a rare catastrophe. The relief measures are to enable the victims to maintain their livelihoods separately and not gather in one place. If the strength of the Bao is insufficient, then the Lianbao will subsidize it, and then the county will subsidize the Lianbao, and the Provincial Government will then subsidize the county. If there are strong young men gathered, then the method of using labor as relief will be adopted. If there are old, weak, women, and children who cannot work, then methods will be found to accommodate and provide relief, and methods will be found to subsidize spring plowing to avoid affecting the autumn harvest. In addition, the approval of tax exemptions for severely affected counties and the preparation of food regulation have all been implemented. The agreements on each item are as follows:</p>
<p>Reduction and Exemption of Field Taxes</p>
<p>After the agreement to exempt the grain tax in the recovered bandit areas in this province, a total of 35 counties and one bureau have reduced the levy of regular tribute by more than 1.1 million yuan. It is not easy to talk about exemptions again, but according to the report last year on counties with happy harvests after the summer drought and autumn harvest, there are Dazhou, Kaijiang, Han, Yunyang in Tuzhong, Qu County, Guang'an, Liangshan, Linshui, Dianjiang, Changshou, Nanchong, Yuechi, Peng'an, Yingshan, Nanbu, Wusheng, Xichong, Yilong, Anyue, Tongnan, Pengxi, Lezhi, An County, Nanxi, Jiang'an, Hejiang, Fuling, Fengdu, Wan County, Fengjie, Zhong County, Hechuan, Qijiang, and other 35 counties have all sent personnel to review and decide that no matter how difficult the finances are, all those that have been reviewed and have reached the starting score of the disaster will be reduced or exempted from field taxes in accordance with the currently promulgated regulations for disaster reporting. Currently, the numbers of various severely affected counties have been approved and publicly announced for reduction and exemption. The amount of reduction and levy has reached more than 1 million yuan, and there are still several counties under review. It is estimated that the total amount of reduction and levy will not be less than 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>Using Labor as Relief</p>
<p>For farmers who have a profession and can cultivate, methods will be found to enable them to return to cultivation or to prepare耕牛, seeds, and so on. For famine victims who have no profession to cultivate and cannot afford to buy rice, the method of using labor as relief will be adopted. (A) There are many things that should be done by each county regarding beneficial agricultural affairs and local public undertakings. This government has issued a general order to the counties to order the district baojia chiefs to supervise and urge young and strong famine victims to carry out them separately, such as engaging in the construction of ponds and embankments that are beneficial to agricultural affairs. The landlords will give them some food. If they engage in road repairs, river dredging, and other work, the local籍 will give them some food. The old, weak, women, and children who can work will also be assigned corresponding work, based on the principle of not sitting idle. (B) The Longhu section of the Sichuan-Yunnan Road urgently needs to be started, and the Jianqu section of the Sichuan-Hubei Road also needs to be renovated. The province has decided to order the county governments of the counties along the road or nearby counties to transfer the district baojia chiefs to organize road workers, and the Provincial Government will give bonuses, totaling more than 1.35 million yuan. If the food is still insufficient, then the counties will raise funds from local public funds to provide subsidies.</p>
<p>Preparing for Spring Plowing</p>
<p>Preparing for spring plowing, now that the time for spring plowing has arrived, there is a shortage of seeds, and there is no timely rain. If methods are not found to remedy the situation, it will inevitably affect this year's autumn harvest. The Provincial Government has ordered the implementation of the method of direct sowing of seedlings in dry weather and the method of mutual assistance in sowing seedlings in dry areas. It has also stipulated the method of maintaining the Bao separately. The Baojia chiefs will investigate private seeds and borrow them from each other to ensure repayment after the autumn harvest, so as to make up for the deficiencies with the surpluses. It has also issued a general order to order the counties to consider the local situation and raise funds to purchase seeds, distribute them to the people, and try to avoid the phenomenon of having land without seeds or having seeds without land. However, the counties affected by the disaster and the Lianbao under their jurisdiction do not all have the ability to help each other. Although the Provincial Relief Association has opened up the Provincial Disaster Relief Reserve Fund of 140,000 yuan and distributed it to the 40 counties with the most severe disasters, it is ultimately a drop in the bucket and has little benefit. As for the agricultural loan of 1 million yuan approved and allocated by the Xingying, the amount is certainly not small, but to allocate it to the 40 counties with the most severe disasters, it will only be 30,000 yuan at most, and 20,000 yuan at least. It is still hoped that a large amount of relief funds will be received for assistance. Currently, the central government has allocated 10,000 yuan in relief bonds. Due to the excessive area of the disaster area and the severity of the disaster, it is still impossible to provide universal relief, and it is still necessary to request additional allocations and hope that people from all walks of life can provide assistance.</p>
<p>Regulating Food</p>
<p>The Provincial Government inquired about the purchase of food from Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces in January last year, and at the same time, first ordered a grain contract with the Agricultural Bank to purchase rice in Wu for 1 million yuan and transport it to Yuwan. Due to the dry water and slow transportation, the grain has not yet been fully transported. The Provincial Government is now stepping up urging, and it will arrive continuously. In March this year, it borrowed another 2 million yuan in Yu, totaling 3 million yuan, to check and purchase transportation funds to regulate the people's food in this province and prevent the occurrence of famine.</p>
<p>In summary, the Sichuan Provincial Government has made every effort to advance on all fronts regarding disaster reporting matters up to now, including exempting grain tax of 2 million yuan, road work bonuses of 1.35 million yuan, grain purchase fund of 3 million yuan, central relief bonds of 1 million yuan, and also using the post-disaster public bonds receivable from the counties to borrow money as credit guarantees, and diverting local non-urgent public funds, as well as local mutual assistance, etc. The reported amount has been expanded to about 6 million yuan. According to statistics, the amount of money raised, reduced, and consumed by the government due to the disaster is about 8 million yuan, and the amount raised by the local government is about 6 million yuan, totaling 14 million yuan, which is not a small amount, but it is still insufficient due to the excessive disaster area. It is still hoped that philanthropists and charitable organizations inside and outside the province will provide effective assistance to save this disaster. Ji also issued the number of the population in the disaster area of Sichuan Province investigated by Min Ying, and the statistics of the number of victims. The total population of the counties affected by the disaster is more than 46.3 million, and the number of victims reaches more than 35 million. The table is from the road.</p>
<h3>Two Bank Managers Kidnapped on the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway</h3>
<p>Hangzhou Correspondence: Since the opening of the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway, no robbery cases have occurred because the local area along the way is peaceful. On the morning of the 18th, Xu Baohua, the vice president of a certain bank in Nanjing, Xu Baiyuan, the manager of a certain bank in Tianjin, and Xu's mother, sister Bao Rong, Bao Gui, and others, a group of five people, took a small chartered car numbered Beijing No. 400 from Beijing to Hangzhou along the highway. At 3:30 pm, when they were passing Donghuang near Shangbai Town in Wukang County, in the drizzling rain, four bandits dressed as farmers wearing straw hats and straw cloaks suddenly rushed out of the bamboo forest beside the road. Each of them held wooden shell guns and ordered the car to stop. The driver saw that the situation was not good and drove forward at full speed. The bandits continued to fire many shots and broke the rear tires of the car, so the car could not move. The four bandits rushed forward and opened the car door. Although Xu was very frightened, his attitude was still quite calm, and he immediately offered 400 yuan in legal tender as a gift, but the bandits refused to accept it. In the end, Xu and Xu were kidnapped and fled towards Xiaofeng County. Xu's mother and sisters, accompanied by the driver, reported to the Donghuang Station. The station telegraphed the military and police authorities of Wukang County and the Provincial Highway Bureau to order the police to investigate and arrest them. Zhu Jiahua, the chairman of the Provincial Government, after receiving the report, has instructed the persons in charge of the Security Department and the Provincial Public Security Bureau to expedite the rescue of Xu and Xu and bring the bandits to justice. A large number of military police have been dispatched to search closely. It is reported that Xu and Xu came here to discuss financial matters with the authorities of the government, and their family members took the highway bus to Hangzhou that night and stayed at the Wanxihu Hotel. They are separately telegraphing relatives and friends in various places and requesting the authorities to rescue them as soon as possible so that the family can be reunited.</p>

<p>(A) Epidemic prevention work: Infectious disease management: Strict management methods and facilities. After receiving a report of an infectious disease, a home visit is made immediately. Starting from March of the 25th year, five kinds of warning signs for infectious diseases such as smallpox, diphtheria, scarlet fever, meningitis, and cholera were made and posted on the doors of the patients' homes. Promoting the management of preventive vaccination: The most important thing in infectious diseases is prevention. For example, receiving cowpox plugs, cholera vaccine, diphtheria toxoid, and preventive injections, for the sake of preventing infection, free vaccination is carried out at any time, and people are sent to persuade households one by one. At the same time, large-scale campaigns are held according to the season. The number of people vaccinated each year has reached more than 300,000. Expanding the summer epidemic prevention department: This office already has the organization of the Joint Summer Epidemic Prevention Office. In the summer of the 24th year, the organization was expanded and the items of work were increased. From May 1 of the 25th year to the end of September, a total of 189,906 injections of cholera-typhoid mixed vaccine were given, an increase of 57,519 injections compared with the 24th year. 17,891 well water disinfections were performed, an increase of 122,837 times compared with the previous year. The poor and sick shelter took in 56 poor and sick people and provided free tap water worth 2,334 yuan. 9,400 slogans and pictures were posted, 33,000 leaflets were printed, and two radio speeches were given. Other work such as sanitary inspection, drug management, fecal management, street cleaning, holding waiter training classes, middle-life statistics, and reducing disease have all achieved significant results. (B) Medical Affairs Work: (A) The work of the health branch: The municipal health branch in this city provides free treatment to the public every day, and there are many people who seek medical treatment. The number of outpatient visits and treatments per month has exceeded 70,000. Adding health branches: In addition to the six branches in the urban area, the original health centers in Jiangning County were taken over to set up five branches, and seven urban and rural branches were successively added. Establishing a municipal hospital: The municipal hospital was completed in January of the 25th year, with a construction cost of 100,000 yuan. In addition to outpatient clinics, there are 120 beds. Internal facilities such as X-ray pathology laboratory have been equipped. Outpatient clinics were started in January of the 25th year, and patients were admitted from February 1. According to the epidemic hospital, the infectious disease hospital was originally equipped with 40 beds, and the number of beds was not enough. More than 3,000 yuan was allocated to supplement the beds to 50, and the interior was repaired and transformed to make it suitable for use. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Changshu: Female Employee Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Liu Manyun, an employee of the accounting office of the county government, is the niece of Chen Fuzhi, the county magistrate. She is 19 years old and dresses in the fashion of the East. She is the only female civil servant in the county government. Since there is no female dormitory inside, she rents a house in the Bao family in Wufu Street.

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Over Sixty Other Public Organizations Held a Tea Party Yesterday to Bid Farewell to Ambassador Wang</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai Encouraged the Abolition of Unequal Treaties. Ambassador Wang Sincerely Accepted and Expressed Hope for Public Cooperation. Departure Postponed to the Fourth of Next Month.</p>
<p>The newly appointed Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, was originally scheduled to depart tomorrow aboard the Dollar Steamship Company's President Coolidge. However, due to unfinished public and private affairs, it has been decided to postpone the departure until the fourth of next month, traveling instead on the President Hoover. The Municipal International Affairs Research Association, the Pacific Association, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Local Association, the Bankers Association, the Native Bankers Guild, the Municipal Party Headquarters Youth League, the World Chinese Students Association, the Major Federations, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, the Lawyers Association, the Accountants Association, the Pacific International Society, the Municipal Education Association, the General Labor Union, the Returned Students Association, the Chinese Women's Association, the Red Cross Society, the Garrison Headquarters, the New Life Movement Promotion Association, the National Roads Association, the Catholic Action Association, the Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee, the World Red Swastika Society, the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, the Journalists Association, and the Chinese Child Welfare Association, along with over sixty other organizations, jointly held a grand tea party yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. on the second floor of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to bid farewell to Mr. Wang. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>The representatives from various organizations and guests, including Li Zhaobin, Wang Xiaoji, Zhong Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Xu Xinliu, Liu Zhanen, Liu Hongsheng, Mu Ouchu, Lin Kanghou, Chen Guangfu, Guo Shun, Zou Bingwen, Wang Zhixin, Pan Gongzhan, He Bingsong, Wu Kaixian, Zhao Jinqing, Guan Jiongzhi, Wang Boqi, Ye Yuhu, Yan Fuqing, Chu Fucheng, Zhu Shaoping, Li Denghui, Dai Zhiqian, Dong Xianguang, Xiong Xiling, Song Zi'an, He Dequi, Bei Songsun, Wu Kaisheng, Zhou Jue, Zhao Tie zhang, Xu Peihuang, Jiang Yanfang, Lu Bohong, Jin Runxiang, Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, Ou Yuanhuai, Song Hanzhang, Mao Yun, Wu Yunzhai, Li Shengwu, Huang Zaoxiong, and foreign guests, including the leaders of the groups, Consul General Norgate, Consul General Orre, U.S. Commercial Counselor Arnold, former Director-General of the Municipal Council Jones, and leaders of the American business community, totaled approximately 500 people, making it a grand occasion.</p>
<p>Speech by Mr. Li</p>
<p>After taking their seats, Li Zhaohuan, Director of the International Affairs Research Association, delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the various organizations, saying: "Today, over sixty organizations in Shanghai are gathered together to bid farewell to Ambassador Wang. Ambassador Wang is a leader in the country, and in Shanghai, for the past several years, he has led our various organizations like an elder brother. Now that Ambassador Wang is representing our country in the United States, we are naturally delighted for him personally, and in terms of our organizational relationships, we are even more fortunate that our leader is being sent abroad, which is a source of pride for us. The glory of our leader in the international arena is also our glory. In the future, our various organizations can also develop abroad as a result of Ambassador Wang's glorious appointment overseas. Speaking of Sino-American relations, we cannot help but feel extremely happy. The United States and China have historically been the most peaceful and friendly countries. U.S. trade with China has increased over the years, ranking first among all countries trading with China. The cultural and educational relationship is particularly close. For example, many leaders in various circles in our country have received American education, and many religious, cultural, and educational organizations in the United States are in China. Many people in our country have received American education. Furthermore, it should be said that the United States has had a great influence on the success of our country's revolution. During the revolutionary process, overseas Chinese students in the United States played a significant role. Currently, there are over two thousand students studying in the United States, and there are over ten thousand overseas Chinese in various industries there. Ambassador Wang is highly respected, and we are deeply pleased to have him as our envoy to the United States. We bid Ambassador Wang farewell with utmost sincerity, and we hope that Ambassador Wang will lead our various organizations to develop abroad. We wish Ambassador Wang success in the future, long life, and eternal health. When Ambassador Wang departs, we will all go to the ship to say goodbye."</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, gave a speech saying, "Dr. Wang Rutang is about to take up the post of Ambassador to the United States. The public organizations of Shanghai have specially prepared refreshments today and are holding this tea party to express our feelings of farewell and to celebrate the obtaining of a suitable person for this important position. As one of the participating organizations in this farewell, the Chamber of Commerce respectfully offers its humble expectations for Ambassador Wang's trip. I hope you will consider them. In recent years, when tracing the great success of national revival, the world must point to Turkey. The reason why Turkey was able to shed the title of 'sick man of the Near East' and stand proudly among the major European powers is not only due to Kemal's exceptional political and military talents, but also because of Ismet's diplomatic skills at the Lausanne Conference, which were recognized by the world as the best in the Near East. Ismet's skillful negotiation was able to restore the broken vase to its original perfection, assisting Mr. Kemal in completing the great revival. Europeans praised Ismet, calling his will strong and his attitude amiable, his nature cautious and his approach approachable, truly a model diplomat. The difficulties and twists and turns of our country's revival are not exactly the same as those of Turkey, but the diplomatic world must have someone like Ismet to enhance the glory of the envoy and assist the central government. Whether it is the Far East or the Near East, there is no difference. Ambassador Wang has a long-standing reputation in the diplomatic world. Looking back at his past achievements, such as personally drafting the treaty to resolve the Shandong issue, enabling the smooth recovery of Qingdao, and after the Jinan May Third Massacre, after years of stalemate, Ambassador Wang also properly negotiated the agreement on troop withdrawal and return. All international cases, no matter how difficult or important, once skillfully negotiated, are resolved like melting ice. The initial completion of our country's tariff autonomy began on July 14, 1928. At that time, the U.S. Secretary of State was Kellogg, and our Minister of Foreign Affairs was Ambassador Wang. The U.S. Minister MacMurray, based on Kellogg's instructions, sent a note to our Ministry of Foreign Affairs supporting tariff autonomy. Subsequently, Ambassador Wang personally concluded tariff autonomy treaties with the countries concerned during his tenure as Foreign Minister. Later, he also discussed the abolition of consular jurisdiction with British Minister Lampson and the ministers of the United States, France, Japan, and other countries in Beijing, and a solution had already been agreed upon, but unfortunately, it was not completed due to other reasons. The recovery of Qingdao is the most important page in territorial integrity, and tariff autonomy is the most important page in sovereignty integrity, and both were personally handled by Ambassador Wang and brought to fruition. Therefore, based on past achievements and looking forward to future accomplishments, the Chamber of Commerce believes that our country's Ismet is not an overstatement in expecting Ambassador Wang. Considering the recent proposals advocated by the government and the public to abolish consular jurisdiction as soon as possible, the United States was the first country to support our country's tariff autonomy, and Ambassador Wang is now being sent to the United States. With his familiarity and experience, he should be able to negotiate the United States' initial agreement to complete the unfinished facilities during his tenure as Foreign Minister. For Ambassador Wang, this is only one scene in his diplomatic career, but for national rights, it is already of great benefit. I respectfully raise a toast to wish Ambassador Wang a safe and healthy journey and progress in his career."</p>
<h3>Ambassador Wang's Speech at the Farewell Reception</h3>

<p>Mr. Wang's Response</p>
<p>Ambassador Wang replied, "I am very grateful to the sixty-odd organizations for holding this grand tea party today to entertain me. There are two points I would like to make. First, I am extremely grateful for this kind of warm hospitality. I am especially grateful that the various organizations were able to jointly hold this event, which saves me a lot of time to socialize with you all. Second, I feel ashamed that the Chairman and Mr. Xiaoji have praised me so much. The Premier's will regarding the abolition of unequal treaties has achieved some of its objectives, but many have not yet been achieved. This requires close cooperation and effort between our government and the people to achieve complete implementation. Regarding Mr. Xiaoji's hopes, I will personally study and handle them with the government authorities and work together with our ambassadors stationed in other countries to vigorously promote the completion of this task. I believe that our country's current situation is more advanced than it was ten years ago, and I think that progress towards this goal will be faster. I sincerely hope that the people of the whole country will assist the government and give me guidance at any time. I originally intended to depart immediately on the President Coolidge, but now I must postpone it slightly until the fourth of next month on the President Hoover because there are still some matters that need to be completed. I sincerely hope that my friends will not give me any more banquets before my departure, so that I will have free time to conclude various matters. I wish you all good health and progress in the endeavors of your organizations."</p>
<p>Public Presentation of Silver Plaque</p>
<p>The various organizations also prepared a silver plaque, inscribed with the four characters "為國宣勞" (xuān láo wèi guó) - Serving the Country with Effort, which was presented to Mr. Wang by Mr. Wang Xiaolai during the tea party. The event ended happily around 7 p.m. Furthermore, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai is scheduled to hold a tea party today at 5 p.m. at its association on Yuqiaxiang Road to bid farewell to Mr. Wang. The Acting Mayor of Shanghai, Yu Hongjun, is scheduled to hold a tea party for Mr. Wang from 6 p.m. to 7 p.m. today at the Municipal Government Reception Center on Baisezhong Road. In addition, the former Deputy Head of the Philippine Tourism Delegation, Wang Xiaolai, Zhu Shaoping, Mao Heyuan, etc., because the delegation's visit to the Philippines the year before last was led by Mr. Wang with great diligence, have specially scheduled a grand banquet tonight (the 20th) at the Meiyuan Restaurant on Fuzhou Road to bid him farewell and have invited celebrities from all walks of life to attend.</p>
<h3>The Javanese Overseas Chinese Tourist Delegation Visited Yesterday</h3>
<p>Six Organizations Welcomed Them Yesterday. They Will Depart for Hangzhou by Train This Afternoon.</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the Javanese Overseas Chinese Youth Tourist Delegation, which arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, was led by the head of the delegation, Pan Kaixing, at 9 a.m. yesterday morning, accompanied by Tan Zhonglu, sent by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau. They took cars from the New Asia Hotel to Zhenru to visit Jinan University. After attending the welcome meeting of the Nanyang Chinese Promotion Association, they went to the city center at 10 a.m. to visit the Public Sports Field, the Museum, the Library, and the China Aviation Construction Association. They also visited the Municipal Government for a week. At 12 p.m., they went to Yeyuan in Jiangwan to attend the welcome banquet of the Chinese Child Welfare Association. After the banquet at 2:30 p.m., they went to Longhua to visit the Longhua Temple, the Shanghai Station Office of the China Eurasia Aviation Corporation, the hangar, and the flying port. At 4 p.m., they took a car from Longhua Airport to the Central Mint at the end of Gordon Road for a visit. The director of the factory, Xi Debing, sent staff to warmly welcome them and led them to visit the various work procedures of minting steel-nickel new subsidiary coins. All members of the delegation were very interested and satisfied. They finished the visit at about 5 p.m. and went straight back to the New Asia Hotel to rest.</p>
<p>Yeyuan Banquet</p>
<p>Six charitable organizations, including the Chinese Child Welfare Association, held a banquet at Yeyuan in Jiangwan at 12:30 p.m. yesterday to welcome the delegation. The attendees included Luo Yunyan, Chen Tiesheng, and Wang Zhentang from the Chinese Child Welfare Association; Wang Yiting, Qu Wenliu, and Xie Jiaqian from the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association; Xiong Bingsan and Mao Yanwen from the Xiangshan Children's Welfare Institute; Pang Jingzhou from the China Red Cross Society; Luo Buzhou from the China Branch of the World Red Swastika Society; Niu Xuhang from the Shanghai YMCA; Dr. Chen Weiping, who had just returned from Southeast Asia; and the head of the delegation, Pan Kaixing, and all 90 male and female members of the delegation. First, the chairman, Luo Yunyan, and Xiong Bingsan delivered welcome speeches on behalf of the various organizations, followed by a reply speech by the head of the delegation, Pan Kaixing, and speeches by Qu Wenliu and others. At 2:30 p.m., the hosts and guests took a group photo and dispersed happily.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>In his welcoming speech, Chairman Luo Yunyan stated that today, six organizations are holding a banquet here to welcome the overseas Chinese from the Nanyang Sanbaolong area who have returned to the country to tour and cleanse the dust. The overseas Chinese are returning to the country for inspection, on the one hand, to visit various constructions in the motherland, and on the other hand, to establish close relations with compatriots in the country. Overseas Chinese have provided great assistance to the motherland, such as last year when the overseas Chinese in various places launched tomb donations and purchased aircraft to celebrate Chairman Chiang's birthday, enriching national defense. They have also provided great assistance to various constructions in the country. We should express our gratitude to all overseas Chinese with 120% sincerity. The overseas Chinese have a long history overseas and occupy a large force in the economic position. It is not based on relying on cannons and warships in the colony as a backing. Our country's overseas Chinese rely entirely on their hands and intelligence, their hard work and perseverance to achieve such achievements, able to keep pace with other foreign nationals. Not only has the motherland reduced the excess, but also relied on the assistance of overseas Chinese in recent years to change imports into exports. This is what our domestic compatriots should deeply thank all overseas Chinese for their efforts. Today's reception is a modest expression of respect. I wish you all good health.</p>
<p>Xiong's Speech</p>
<p>Xiong Xiling delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the various organizations, saying that today, it is a great honor and pleasure for six organizations, including the Chinese Child Welfare Association, to welcome the overseas Chinese from Nanyang Sanbaolong who have returned to the country to tour. Speaking of Sanbaolong, I recall a past history that I would like to report to you. During the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, when our country's first adventurer, Eunuch Sanbao Zheng He, went to Nanyang, he led more than 27,000 soldiers on warships to travel throughout Nanyang, Java, the Philippines, and other places, passing through seven times. Currently, Sanbaolong still has the remains of Zheng He buried, so the tomb of Eunuch Sanbao will always be in that place, immortal. The name of Sanlong also originated from this. After Zheng He's seven voyages to Nanyang, people from our country went there one after another, feeling that the place was very good. Therefore, the number of people going overseas to do business increased. Our nation loves peace, and most of the overseas Chinese are able to work hard, and only then are they able to stand today. The various overseas Chinese are rich in experience in running businesses, especially in the economic aspect, the overseas Chinese have provided a lot of strength in assisting the country, and they are truly the economic pioneers of the people of the country. I hope that the overseas Chinese can return to the country and cooperate with the people of the country to handle various undertakings to develop the country's economy. I hope that this tourist delegation will convey the various industrial, commercial, educational, and political conditions in the country to the overseas Chinese as much as possible, and please convey the 120% ardent hope of the people of the country. I went to Java this time to attend the Far East Conference on the Prohibition of Trafficking in Women and Children, and I am very grateful for the warm welcome from the overseas Chinese. Today, this welcome is a modest expression of respect. I wish you all good health and wish all overseas Chinese good health.</p>
<p>The Head's Response</p>
<p>The head of the delegation, Pan Kaixing, replied, stating that today, I thank the various organizations for the reception here on behalf of the delegation. Mr. Xiong's opinions are highly accepted by my colleagues, conveying the overseas Chinese and assisting the motherland is an obligation that should be fulfilled. I am grateful for the various awards from the people of the country. I represent all the overseas Chinese to thank you for your kindness. This time returning to the motherland for sightseeing is the second time. Last year, when our delegation organized the first sightseeing tour, we saw that the various constructions of the motherland were progressing rapidly. After returning to Nanyang, we conveyed to the overseas Chinese that they were very willing to appreciate and observe the various undertakings of the motherland. Therefore, there was the organization of the second sightseeing tour. This time returning to the country, it coincides with the national unity. Returning to the country for sightseeing is really a happy event. Various constructions have greatly improved compared to last year. We plan to use this short period of time to conduct a detailed inspection of the local industries, commerce, politics, education, various undertakings, and various construction situations. Returning to the country for sightseeing is already a great honor. The welcome from the various organizations has really made our overseas Chinese very excited. Finally, speeches were given by Qu Wenliu and Pang Jingzhou (speeches omitted).</p>
<p>Departure for Hangzhou This Afternoon</p>
<p>All members of the delegation are scheduled to take the Shanghai-Hangzhou train at 12:50 p.m. this afternoon to visit scenic spots in Hangzhou. All matters concerning tours, meals, and accommodation are entrusted to the China Travel Service for handling. It is planned to stay in Hangzhou for two days and return to Shanghai on the 23rd to visit industrial and commercial sectors and various agencies, and then go to Suzhou, Wuxi, and visit the capital of Jinjing and observe the construction of the capital. Then, they will go to Qufu, Taishan, and other places for a tour.</p>

<h3>Over Six Hundred Silk Weavers Petitioned the Police Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>Rescuing Zhou Yunqing and Dispersing Midway. Damei Factory Goes on Strike. Rongcheng Petitions.</p>
<p>After Zhou Yunqing, a preparer for the Silk Weaving Industry Union in District 1, was arrested, workers petitioned yesterday to rescue him but were stopped. Damei workers declared a strike for wages for the Revolutionary Memorial Day. Rongcheng workers petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday because the factory fired representatives. A summary of the details is as follows:</p>
<p>Workers in District 1 Petition for Rescue</p>
<p>After Zhou Yunqing, a preparer for the Silk Weaving Industry Union in District 1, was arrested by the Police Bureau, he confessed to participating in the Communist Youth League and is currently being investigated by the General Bureau. Yesterday morning, six hundred workers from various factories in the district gathered and petitioned the Police General Bureau to rescue him. After receiving the report, the General Bureau immediately dispatched a large number of armed police officers to strictly guard the vicinity of the General Bureau on Penglai Road and set up barbed wire at various key traffic points. After receiving the report, the Municipal Party Headquarters immediately sent Li Weixiong, a cadre of the People's Training Section, to drive to persuade the people. They dispersed at about 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Damei Strike and Rongcheng Petition</p>
<p>(1) The Damei Silk Weaving Factory on Zhangjiazhai Road, Lane 113, in West Shanghai employs more than 100 male and female workers. Because the factory did not pay the wages for the memorial day of the 72 Martyrs of Huanghuagang, the workers, after the representatives negotiated with the factory director without success, declared a strike the night before last, demanding payment in accordance with the regulations. The Silk Weaving Industry Association yesterday publicly submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters, requesting strict prohibition. (2) The workers of the Rongcheng Silk Factory in Zhabei opposed the employer's dismissal of worker representatives. Yesterday afternoon, they sent representatives to petition the Social Affairs Bureau to stop it. Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Section of the Third Department, met with them and promised to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Iwai Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Returning to Japan on the 21st to Report</p>

He is scheduled to return to Japan on the Shanghai Maru at 9 a.m. on the 21st to report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on his experience in Sichuan.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Pays Attention to Shanghai Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>Section Chief Liu of the Labor Department Returns to Beijing to Report. Hopes that Labor and Capital Will Understand and Tolerate Each Other.</p>
<p>Nanjing, Central News Agency, 19th - Recent labor unrest in Shanghai has been quite turbulent. Liu Xuguang, section chief of the Labor Department, who was previously sent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to investigate the truth, has returned to Beijing to report. It is reported that the silk weaving industry dispute has been largely resolved, and the Xinyu Factory labor unrest has also subsided. However, the Yigong Spinning Factory is encountering difficulties in mediation because the employer is a foreign merchant. Efforts are still being made to mediate. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, based on the Shanghai workers' cost of living index, this year is about 7.7% higher than last year. In general, prices in December 1936 were about 20% higher than in January of the same year. Workers' living difficulties are indeed real. However, workers' legitimate demands should be pursued through legal channels and should not resort to strikes or slowdowns, which would undermine social stability and destroy the foundation of national industry. Employers should also regard labor as part of the capital. Whether workers' lives are stable is closely related to production efficiency and should not be ignored. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce earnestly hopes that labor and capital will understand and tolerate each other and develop production to overcome difficulties.</p>
<h3>The Taxpayers Association Notifies Chinese Taxpayers to Urge the Reduction of Collection</h3>
<p>Public Opinion Creates Strength. The Reappearance of Light Requires Consistent Efforts to Urge the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association notifies Chinese taxpayers: The Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers Association for your information. The Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council's failure to economize and its indulgence in overdue donations have led to an unbalanced budget and an intention to increase taxes by 14.29%, which is planned to be implemented from July 1 this year. The Chinese directors are well aware of the people's conditions, represent public opinion, and voted against the tax increase proposal. However, due to a one-vote difference in power, justice and fairness were not protected. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens Federation and its first district and other sub-associations, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and its affiliated trade associations, various hometown associations, especially the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association, the Second Special District Citizens Federation, etc., have issued declarations, warnings, or assistance, creating the power of public opinion. The Chinese directors have been able to exercise serious expressions of maintenance and trust in public opinion, so that the stubborn can be subdued, and the justice and fairness will reappear in the light. The Taxpayer Association Representative Conference resolved on April 12, "Regarding the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council's proposal to increase taxes from July 1, 1936, it should be postponed to the next year for review, and the Municipal Council should be ordered to effectively reduce unnecessary expenses and urge the collection of overdue donations within this year in order to be reasonable," etc. The foreign ratepayers' annual meeting, on the 14th, passed an amendment in a very short period of time, "Extending the implementation to January next year." All of our Chinese taxpayers should know that the previous resolution represents the meaning of more than 95% of the population and more than 64% of the donation amount, and the latter amendment is actually still the intention of our Taxpayer Association, which is affected by the meaning of less than 5% of the population and less than 26% of the donation amount. Looking at the foreign taxpayers who attended the annual meeting against the extension amendment, only one person did not agree, and it is clear that the foreign taxpayers are unwilling to increase the burden. It is the expression of the meaning of our Chinese taxpayers that has been universally sympathized with. This association will do its best to represent the truth, follow public opinion, and urge the Municipal Council to earnestly implement the two things of reduction and collection, so that the tax increase next year will become unnecessary, so that all taxpayers can benefit from it. It is hoped that all taxpayers will work together to seek the justice and fairness that has been seen in the light and not be obscured by the darkness. I hope everyone will be aware.</p>

<h3>Mr. Pan Kung-chan Discusses the Labor-Management Dispute in the Silk Weaving Industry</h3>
<p>Dispositions Remain Effective Pending Appeal Resolution; Workers Should Be Investigated for Strike Actions Aimed at Coercion</p>
<p>Following the Mediation and Ruling by the Bureau of Social Affairs in the ongoing labor unrest in the silk weaving industry in this city, some factories have yet to quell the disturbances. A reporter from the Central News Agency, seeking to understand the truth, interviewed Mr. Pan Kung-chan, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, yesterday. According to Mr. Pan, concerning this labor-management dispute in the silk weaving industry, after the Bureau received the labor's request for improved treatment and conditions, it repeatedly convened mediation sessions with the City Party Headquarters, offering various forms of persuasion. However, due to the conflicting positions of both parties, a complete agreement could not be reached. To safeguard the interests of both parties and avoid prolonged delays, the Bureau, aside from the agreed-upon conditions, made a decision on the labor's request for a general wage increase of 30%, moderately assessing the situation of both parties and deciding on a general increase of 10%. All other wage-related items without agreement were rescinded and ruled upon. On April 1st, both parties were ordered to comply. Unexpectedly, the Silk Weaving Industry Association declared its dissatisfaction and filed an appeal. Simultaneously, the labor side reported that the Association had notified all factories to uniformly defy the Bureau's ruling, causing renewed unrest, with workers petitioning the Bureau. The Bureau dispatched personnel to persuade them to remain calm and await resolution. Recently, workers at the Mei-Ya Jing-Wei Factory went on strike due to unmet demands for wages on the Huanghuagang Memorial Day. Upon receiving the report, the Bureau immediately intervened, ordering a return to work by a specific date and instructing the factory to pay according to the law. However, the Mei-Ya factories abruptly announced a shutdown, leading to intensified worker emotions and potentially excessive actions, plunging the labor unrest into a stalemate. Although the Bureau's handling of the labor-management dispute in this industry is under appeal by the management to the Municipal Government, the disposition remains legally effective pending resolution of the appeal. Therefore, the Association's notification to factories to delay compliance is inappropriate, and the workers' subsequent strike, with intentions of coercion, should also be investigated. In summary, the Bureau handles labor-management disputes with utmost impartiality, sincerely hoping that both sides can understand each other and eliminate the strife of emotions, thus making it easier to resolve disputes.</p>

The ship has over one hundred cabins of various classes and is equipped with a ten-ton crane and cargo booms. All classes of cabins are equipped with hot and cold water pipes, bathrooms, and separate men's and women's restrooms. The ship is spacious and experiences no vibration, making passenger movement very comfortable. The grand dining hall has a state-of-the-art electric lighting system, providing soft and appropriate lighting, making it the best among ships on the Yangtze River. The "Minqin" is 142 feet long, 26 feet wide, and has a speed of 13 nautical miles per hour. With a draft of 7 feet 6 inches, it is suitable for travel on the Sichuan River in both dry and flood seasons. The ship has over eighty cabins of various classes and is equipped with a five-ton crane and cargo booms. Inside the compartments, there is an additional one-ton electric hoist that can transport various goods and rail cars. The hatches are equipped with sealed covers, which can prevent the ship from sinking in case of an emergency. These features are unprecedented among ships on the Sichuan River.</p>

<h3>The City Police Bureau Promotes Opium Prohibition</h3>
<p>Fourth-Term License Renewals End at Month's End; Last Chance for Unlicensed Opium Smokers</p>
<p>The City Police Bureau has been actively promoting opium prohibition. The fourth term for opium smokers to renew their licenses, which began at the beginning of this month, will end in two weeks. According to Director Ye of the bureau's responsible department, speaking to a reporter from the Guomin News Agency yesterday, the renewal period for opium smokers in this term will end at the end of the month. Those who fail to renew their licenses by the deadline will be treated as private opium smokers and prosecuted. The bureau urges the 20,000 to 30,000 unlicensed opium smokers in the city to pay special attention and renew their licenses as soon as possible. In recent days, hundreds of private opium smokers have been arrested in the city, causing all drug rehabilitation hospitals to be full. Among them, repeat offenders have been discovered and handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for severe punishment as a warning to others. At the same time, the bureau, out of special consideration for opium smokers, will still provide drug rehabilitation for unlicensed opium smokers who voluntarily surrender for treatment without punishment. This is a rare opportunity and a true blessing for opium smokers. It is hoped that they will awaken and take advantage of it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Party and Government Confer and Mediate the Tram Strike of the British Company</h3>
<p>The Labor Side Publishes the Demands and Negotiation Process; the Company's Plan to Recruit New Workers Further Escalates the Turmoil</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, all workers in the traffic and mechanical departments of the Shanghai Electric Construction Company, a British company in the International Settlement, put forward five demands for treatment. After the negotiations broke down, they announced a joint strike on the morning of the 18th (yesterday), which is a very serious situation. It is feared that it will be difficult to resolve in the short term. The labor side issued a statement yesterday on the negotiation process of this case and asked for assistance. The management plans to recruit unemployed workers to replace the striking workers. A reporter from Dagong News Agency specially investigated and recorded the details below.</p>
<p>The Three Stages of the Strike</p>
<p>Two thousand two hundred tram drivers and ticket sellers of the Shanghai Electric Construction Company, a British company, felt that the price of goods was high and the original wages were difficult to maintain a living. In January of this year, they put forward ten demands and asked the company to accept them, but the company did not express its opinion at that time. Therefore, all tram drivers and ticket sellers announced a joint strike on February 10th (the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month of last year). They then submitted a request to the Party and Government authorities for assistance. After receiving the request, the City Party Headquarters, the Bureau of Social Affairs, the General Labor Union, and other organizations sent personnel to persuade the workers to resume work first, and then try to mediate the demands. It was decided to wait for five solutions to be worked out. Then, on March 3rd, all the workers of the three factories on Jing'an Temple Road, Huishan Road, and Baikai'er Road went on strike because the factory fired two workers without cause. Because the company refused to reinstate the two workers, the strike lasted for three days. Then, all the workers in the traffic department responded to the strike, causing the trams to stop again. Fortunately, the Party and Government authorities quickly mediated and issued a joint announcement, ordering everyone to resume work. At that time, the labor side put forward three demands, but the company only accepted one, and the other two were not negotiated. The factory workers believed that the company was not sincere in accepting the demands, so they jointly initiated the organization of a labor union and demanded that the company sign a collective labor-management agreement. However, the Party and Government mediation was ineffective, so all 3,200 traffic and mechanical workers jointly declared a strike on the morning of the 18th of this month to prompt the management to realize the situation.</p>
<p>The Labor Side Announces the Truth of the Labor Unrest</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from Dagong News Agency met with members of the Tram Workers Strike Committee and published the course of the strike. According to them, the outside world expressed criticism of the tram workers' strike, but the workers' strike was forced by the environment and had to happen. Compared with the tram workers of the Chinese and French companies, the treatment of all the workers of this company is worse. For example, Chinese and French companies have copper plate rewards and bonuses for ticket sellers, and wages are paid for holidays and weekly breaks, while the British company does not have these treatments. When the second strike occurred, three demands were put forward: ㊀ the issue of retirement pay; ㊁ the issue of wages for workers when they are sick; and ㊂ the issue of the reasons for the dismissal of the two workers. These three demands have been reported to the Party and Government authorities, who considered them to be quite reasonable. Lu Jingshi, a member of the City Party Headquarters, summoned the Chinese comprador of the company, Mr. Hu Ziyu, to talk to him. Lu notified Hu to submit the matter to the company's director, Mr. Ivan. Unexpectedly, Hu only submitted the issue of retirement pay to the director and did not report the issues of sick wages, etc., to Ivan, so when the representatives of the Party and Government authorities went to mediate, Ivan claimed that he did not know and refused to negotiate. Hu should be responsible for this. Among the five demands put forward this time, one is the condition that was not included in the negotiations proposed by the second group of workers, but Ivan only accepted the principle and refused to negotiate, and it is not known what he meant by it. At present, all workers of the tram company are paid wages for working every day. If they get sick, they will not be paid. However, how can anyone guarantee that they will not get sick? If they get sick and have no money, how can they survive? Therefore, the conditions put forward are legitimate in terms of human sentiment and law. However, the strike is also not what they want. It is the result of being forced and unable to bear the pressure. Now that the labor unrest has started, we hope that the management will negotiate sincerely, otherwise, we will never resume work. However, the tram is related to public transport, and we are very sorry to the passengers.</p>
<p>The Company Will Recruit Unemployed Replacements</p>
<p>After the workers of the Shanghai Tram Company went on strike, passengers who purchased monthly tickets complained. In order to maintain transportation, the company recruited more than 30 unemployed workers yesterday to replace the striking ticket sellers. It also plans to send ticket inspectors to drive the trams and recruit White Russians to work in the mechanical department. Therefore, it is feared that the labor unrest will further escalate.</p>
<p>Workers Form Vigilance Teams to Maintain Order</p>
<p>More than 5,300 striking workers of the company have decided not to resume work until their demands are met. However, in order to prevent the company from recruiting unemployed workers or White Russians to replace them, they have organized 20 vigilance teams and 20 maintenance teams, each with 10 people, to work at the factory gates on Baikai'er Road, Huishan Road, and Jing'an Temple Road to prevent new workers from entering the factory. Therefore, if the company recruits new workers, it will be difficult to avoid disturbances.</p>
<p>The Party and Government Advise and Schedule Mediation</p>
<p>In order to find a way to mediate the tram strike, the Party and Government authorities of this city sent Lu Yinchu, Yu Yaoqiu from the City Party Headquarters, Zhu Jintao from the Bureau of Social Affairs, and Gong Yuting from the General Labor Union to the tram company's head office and the Xinjiang Road labor union at 2:00 PM yesterday to investigate the truth from both labor and management. The representatives of the Party and Government authorities have submitted the results of the investigation to the responsible officials. The Bureau of Social Affairs has notified both labor and management to submit two responsible representatives each and will invite the City Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union to organize a mediation committee and notify both parties to attend and await mediation.</p>
<h3>The Child Welfare Association and Parents' Association Send Condolences to the Parents of He Xingxiu</h3>
<p>He Xingxiu Was Sixteen Years Old and Lost Her Life Saving Another Child</p>
<p>At about 8:00 AM on the 16th of this month, a tragic incident occurred near the bus stop about fifty steps south of the Tianyao Bridge south of Xujiahui, Shanghai, in which a girl was crushed to death by a truck. The girl, named He Xingxiu, was sixteen years old and lived at No. 2652 Tianyao Bridge East, Xujiahui. She was studying medicine at Mingde Elementary School in Xujiahui, and her parents, He Yechun and his wife, loved her as their own daughter. Before the incident, Xingxiu was walking on the side of the road when she saw a three-year-old boy playing in the middle of the road. At the same time, a mud truck suddenly drove from the south. Fearing that the boy would be hit, the girl rushed to rescue him. As she was saving the boy, Xingxiu herself was knocked down by the truck's wheels, rolled over her face, and her head was crushed, killing her instantly. Then, the police officer Liu Zhennan, who was stationed at No. 3480, went forward and stopped the mud truck. He took the driver, Liu Anquan, and the father of the deceased, He Yechun, to the Jinding Bridge Police Station for questioning. He then prepared a document to be sent to the court for further investigation. After hearing the news, the China Child Welfare Association and the Shanghai Parents' Education Association believed that the girl was only sixteen years old and was able to rescue others without fear of danger. If her parents and teachers had not taught her well, she would not have been able to do this. The girl's death in saving another child was a noble and great sacrifice, which is worthy of infinite respect and mourning. Therefore, they sent a letter each yesterday afternoon to console the girl's parents, He Yechun and his wife, asking them to restrain their grief. They also sent a wreath each to express their love and sorrow for the girl. The condolence letter from the Parents' Education Association is as follows: Mr. Yechun, I am deeply saddened to hear that your daughter, Ms. Xingxiu, died tragically while rescuing others. It is difficult to express in words the grief you must feel as a parent who loved your daughter deeply. However, we believe that your daughter's sacrifice for saving others is a noble and great act, and its spiritual value will exist forever and be worthy of lasting commemoration by the world. We hope that you will restrain your grief and not be too saddened. We send this letter of condolence and a wreath to express our love and sorrow for your daughter. We pray for your acceptance. Sincerely, Shanghai Parents' Education Association, April 19th.</p>

<h3>President Yu Does Not Forget Old Friends</h3>
<p>Lunch Feast Yesterday; Shared Life and Death Ten Years Ago; Driver Qi Yuming</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in the spring of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, President Yu Youren ran around to relieve the siege of Xi'an. He detoured through Japan and the Soviet Union for thousands of miles and transferred to Kulun. The driver who drove south by car was Qi Yuming. The car drove through the deserted Han Dynasty, with boundless sand, and was often lost. Entering the territory of Inner Mongolia, it arrived at the Black Church and was looted by rebellious soldiers who threatened to take away what they were carrying and left with a roar. At that time, the followers decided to leave this place to avoid danger. Yu also thought so. However, rebellious soldiers were surrounding the area, and the gasoline was about to run out. One of the drivers was terrified and dared not drive. Despite all attempts to persuade him, he was ineffective. Only Qi was loyal, brave, and willing to share life and death with Yu. He then drove the car out of danger and turned north. He met Feng Yuxiang, who was traveling south from Kulun, and they traveled together to Wuyuan. Feng praised Qi for being able to save his master from danger in times of crisis and issued an order to the Northwest military and political circles to reward him. President Yu and Qi have been separated for ten years. Recently, Qi came to Shanghai specifically to pay his respects and express his long-term separation. Yu specially hosted a feast for Qi at the Laixi Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road at 12:00 noon yesterday, inviting members of the Central Committee Tian Kunshan, Supervisory Committee Yan Zhuang, Zeng Dao, Liu Houwu, and other twenty people to accompany them. They dispersed at 2:00 PM, having enjoyed themselves to the fullest. It is reported that Qi will leave Shanghai that day and return to Xi'an.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping of Mao and Qian Two Children Broken in Nanhui County</h3>
<p>Three Ticket-Watching Bandits Were Captured on the Spot; The Hostages Were Rescued and Returned to Their Families; The Situation Was Complex and the Trial Was Postponed</p>
<p>Mao Chaodong, a local silk broker residing at No. 9, Lane 301, Rufu Road, is from a moderately well-off family. His son, Zhikang (16 years old), was studying at Lishi Middle School in Jiangyin. Recently, he returned to Shanghai for the spring break and rested at home. At noon on the 4th of this month, he and Qian Sandi, a 14-year-old from the same hometown living at No. 260, Heller Road, were playing in front of the door when they were kidnapped by several bandits who hired a car and disappeared without a trace. Several days later, they successively sent letters to Mao's father demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan. A total of nine letters were sent. The last letter stated that if they were ignored again, they would cut off Zhikang's hands and feet and send them to his house. The father was anxious and reported the situation to the Jiadian Road Police Station. Hua Detective Shao Jingfan investigated and arrested Mei Fufu, a native of Pudong, at No. 5 in the same lane as the victim Mao's house on the afternoon of the 16th. The next morning, he was sent to the Special First Court for temporary detention. Because the hostages and accomplices were not found (no bystanders were allowed, and no announcement was made), it was learned that Mao and Qian were hidden in a cellar at No. 104 Qianjia Temple in Nanhui County, Pudong. Therefore, he and Hua Detective Xu Yongyuan, Wang Jinshou, and Detective Chen Ruisheng, each carrying weapons, secretly went to Pudong at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. Accompanied by the perpetrator Mei, they drove to the location mentioned. Detective Shao bravely and detectives rushed in and captured three local bandits, Wang Jinlin, Yang Zhitian, and Qian Rongsheng, who were guarding the hostages. They rescued the hostages Mao Zhikang and his companion Qian Sandi from the cellar and took them back to the police station. Mao and Qian were both returned to their families. Detective Shao also arrested Pan Baosheng, a native of Changzhou, at No. 129 Yangshupu Road, and the police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 347, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law for the crime of demanding a ransom. He also said that the details of Mao's kidnapping were quite complicated, and it would take half an hour to present them. Judge Zhong Qing was presiding over the case and postponed the hearing to the 24th. There are many other cases, so he asked the court to postpone the hearing and combine it with other cases. Xiao asked the defendants briefly and ordered them to be detained and the matter to be examined again at a later date.</p>
<h3>How Can a City God Statue Serve as Witness to a Wedding?</h3>
<p>Sun Changsheng fantasizes, still claiming it's a Ningbo custom. The court rules the defendants not guilty.</p>
<p>Sun Changsheng, a 53-year-old man from Zhenjiang who runs a Western restaurant at 28 Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, filed a lawsuit in the local court against his concubine, Gu Ahe, 35, and Tang Wu, the police chief of the Ximen Branch, for obstructing his marriage. The lawsuit stated that Gu Ahe had been his wife for six years. Last year, while living in Nanyang Bridge, a dispute arose with the second landlord. Tang, the police chief from Ximen Branch, mediated the matter, and they became friends. Unexpectedly, he had an affair with his wife, and his wife abandoned their home to live with Tang, and so on. Tang Wu hired lawyer Song Yuntao, who presented evidence arguing that Sun Changsheng and Gu Ahe were merely in an informal concubinage relationship and had no right to sue. Furthermore, he had not cohabitated with Gu Ahe; this was a false accusation, using the term "wife" as a smokescreen. He had even requested lawyer Li Baosen to send a letter to Gu Ahe, always referring to the relationship as merely cohabitation, without any marital ties. He therefore requested that the original lawsuit be rejected. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu Lude held a hearing. Sun Changsheng still claimed that they were formally married, while Tang denied any relationship with Gu Ahe. Gu Ahe, however, maintained that her relationship with Sun was concubinage. Their testimonies differed. The judge then questioned Sun Changsheng in detail. If he and Gu Ahe were formally married, where was the wedding held, and who were the matchmakers, so that evidence could be presented? Sun said that only he and Gu Ahe kowtowed before the City God statue, with his father present as a witness. This was considered a completed wedding according to Ningbo customs. The judge, upon hearing this, burst into laughter, saying that in all the world, he had never heard of using a City God statue as a witness to a wedding. He immediately declared the defendants not guilty and dismissed the lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Eighteen People Poisoned After Ching Ming Festival Lunch Gathering with Relatives to Gamble</h3>
<p>Conflicts arose during the division of family property. Fei Junwen, who benefited the most, is under suspicion. The test results showed that the food was mixed with arsenic.</p>
<p>Fei Kemin, a local resident of 70 Yuanchang Lane, 471 East Henan Road, accumulated considerable wealth through real estate. He passed away on August 4, 1935, leaving behind four sons and two daughters. Disputes often arose between the children over the division of the family property. The brothers, Fei Yusheng, Fei Junwen, and Fei Meiwen, were constantly in conflict, and the infighting never ceased. On the afternoon of April 2nd, Fei Meiwen and others celebrated the Ching Ming Festival at home, inviting relatives and friends for lunch. Before the meal was over, about eighteen people at the table, including Fei Meiwen, Fei Meijin, and their relatives and friends, experienced severe abdominal pain and vomiting. They were rushed to Tongren Hospital, where doctors diagnosed them as being poisoned. After intestinal lavage and other procedures, they recovered because the poisoning was mild. Subsequently, the Huishan Police Department ordered detectives to investigate and sent the food to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department for testing. The results showed that the soy sauce and sugar contained more than two grams of arsenic. If those poisoned had not vomited first, death would have been certain. Investigations revealed that everyone at the table had symptoms of poisoning and vomited, except for Fei Junwen, who did not vomit at all. Recently, Fei Junwen had a dispute with Fei Meiwen and others over the division of the property. A similar incident had occurred at Fei Meiwen's home twice last year. Therefore, Fei Junwen is suspected of involvement in this case. The detectives were ordered to arrest Fei Junwen and Zhou Asan, the Yangzhou cook who prepared the feast that day. During the arrest, Xu Zhongshi, a Gaoyou native who was staying with Fei Junwen, tried to flee but was apprehended. Yesterday morning, they were brought before Judge Xiao Xie-fen in the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, stated that Fei Junwen was suspected in this case and charged him with attempted murder under Article 273 of the Criminal Law. He added that Fei Junwen had recently had a dispute with Fei Meiwen over electricity and that family disputes were common. Fei Junwen, Zhou Asan, and Xu Zhongshi all denied any intention of murder. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Xiao ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for April 27th.</p>
<h3>Murder During a Gambling Game</h3>
<p>Widow Accuses Teahouse Owner, Implicating Local Wardens</p>
<p>Zhang Fucheng and Gu Daosheng, local ruffians from Shenjiang Village in Jiangwan, opened a small teahouse. Recently, they openly converted the teahouse into a gambling den, hosting gambling games every evening. Yang Qiusheng, a 42-year-old villager who worked in an iron factory, received his wages of thirty yuan at the end of last month and went home. He stopped at the teahouse to gamble and won several yuan before returning home at 10 PM. Tragically, Yang was murdered about a hundred paces from the teahouse, on the embankment of a field. His throat was cut, and all his thirty-odd yuan were stolen. When his wife, Yang Wangshi, learned about this the next morning, she accused Zhang Fucheng and Gu Daosheng of running the gambling den, claiming that her husband's money was revealed, leading to his murder for financial gain. She argued that people from the gambling den were responsible, and that Gao Jinxiang and Guo Alin were stationed on the road as lookouts. How could they not have known about her husband's murder? She filed a lawsuit in the local court, implicating Yang Meide, the local warden of the thirtieth district, as one of the gambling den owners. After the court examined the body, the police were notified and arrested Zhang Fucheng and Gu Daosheng. Gao Jinxiang and Guo Alin fled. The police delivered the arrested criminals to the local court for interrogation and detention. Today, the court summoned the deceased's wife and the local warden for detailed questioning.</p>
<h3>Knife-wielding Assailant Hu Ruigen Arrested</h3>
<p>Hu Ruigen, an 18-year-old peddler from Ningbo, had a dispute with his fellow townsman, Chen Afu, on May 11th of last year at 2:30 PM at the Kao Hu Zao at 66 Xinji Pai Road, over overdue association dues. They argued and fought, and Hu, being weaker, suffered losses and left resentfully. After a while, carrying a triangular dagger, he waited near the Xinji Bang Road on Tangshan Road. When Chen Afu passed by, he rushed up from behind without asking questions, pulled out the dagger, and slashed Chen's legs twice before fleeing without a trace. Chen collapsed and cried for help. The patrolmen who heard the alarm arrived and took Chen to Tongren Hospital for treatment, where he spent several months recovering. The Huishan Police Department sent detectives to apprehend Hu Ruigen, but there were no leads. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, Chen Afu encountered Hu on Fielun Road and turned him over to the Chinese detective Huang Fugeng, who brought him to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was brought before the Third Criminal Court of the Special District Court. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, requested detention. According to Chen Afu's testimony and the defendant's evasive answers, Judge Xiao ordered that he be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Three Young Men Steal Due to Financial Difficulties from Dancing</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Imprisonment in Various Places as a Warning</p>
<p>Chen Zhong, Chen He, and Wang Pingfang, young students from Guangdong, indulged in dancing, neglecting their studies and finding themselves in financial difficulties. They still did not change their ways, and their figures were often seen in dance halls such as Dalu and Shunfeng. Recently, they resorted to theft, joining with Zhang Fa, A Deng, and others to steal items from companies such as Fuli. The company discovered their actions, and Chen and the other three were arrested, while Zhang and Deng escaped. They were sent to the Special District Court, where the police lawyer Zhang Shizhu charged them with theft. Investigations revealed that Chen and the others had committed five thefts in total. Yesterday, Judge Pan Zhenyang held a hearing, found them guilty, and sentenced Chen Zhong to one year of imprisonment, Chen He to nine months, and Wang Pingfang to six months, as a warning.</p>
<h3>Chen Jichang Illegally Detains a Young Girl, Deliberately Violating Criminal Law</h3>
<p>The Girl's Mother Sues for Disrupting the Family; The Defendant Did Not Appear and the Hearing Was Postponed</p>
<p>Chen Jichang, formerly an engineer at the Yong'an Sock Factory at the intersection of Beile Road and Rue du Père Huc in the French Concession, is now working in the Second Prison directly under the Ministry of Justice in Beixinjing. When he was an engineer, he met Mei Ying, a 20-year-old sock weaver from Taizhou living at 703 Beile Road, and they fell in love. After Chen was transferred to the prison, he lured Mei Ying away in January of this year to a small inn on Xujiahui Road and hid her there, where they engaged in illicit relations. Chen twice sent letters to Mei Ying's mother, Jiang, firmly stating his desire to marry Mei Ying. Jiang stated that her daughter was already betrothed to a man surnamed Jiang, and if Chen wanted to marry Mei Ying, he should first break the engagement with the Jiang family before discussing the matter. The matter was delayed until recently. Chen again had someone send a card to Jiang, stating his desire to speak with Mei Ying and asking Jiang to call the number on the card. At this point, Jiang believed that Chen was deliberately violating criminal law. She hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court, accusing Chen Jichang of disrupting the family and requesting that he be prosecuted according to law. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhu Chuzhe held a hearing based on the lawsuit. Only the plaintiff and her lawyer appeared. After a brief hearing, the judge, noting that the defendant had not appeared, ordered that the hearing be postponed until the defendant could be summoned.</p>
<h3>Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession Requests Abolition of Consular Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>Firmly abolish consular jurisdiction to establish judicial dignity, aiming to break free from the shackles of unequal treaties.</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession held its 37th regular meeting yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, with Mao Yun as chairman and Zhang Shishi as recorder. After the chairman reported on the association's activities, they began discussing and passing important motions. (1) Regarding the monthly donations for employment agencies, the board of directors should be requested to submit a revised proposal for reduction immediately. (Resolved) Passed. (2) A telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting the abolition of consular jurisdiction was submitted and passed. (Resolved) Amended and passed. The meeting adjourned around 5 PM. The text of the telegram to Wang Zhengting, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government, is as follows: (Address Omitted) "We respectfully submit that the unification of judicial power is an essential element of an independent nation. However, since the Qing Dynasty signed unequal treaties with the powers, the so-called consular jurisdiction has been established by various countries, ostensibly to protect the safety of foreigners' lives and property, but in reality, it provides a convenient means for unscrupulous individuals to profit privately. Those who can obtain consular licenses openly engage in gambling, which is not prohibited by law. This is deeply regrettable for countries ruled by law, and it is impossible to maintain the safety of people's lives and property. To ensure the governance of society, consular jurisdiction must be abolished. This is the first reason. In any politically complete country, no interference is permitted within its territory. This is a universally accepted principle in international law. Consular jurisdiction undermines the integrity of the judiciary of an independent country and is condemned by legal experts around the world. It not only infringes upon China's sovereign rights but also disrupts the judicial system of the home country. From the perspective of judicial dignity, those who are subject to it suffer losses. This is the second reason why it must be urgently abolished. Moreover, modern diplomacy aims at collective security, calling for reciprocity and equality. Article 19 of the Treaty of Versailles specifically states, 'The League of Nations may from time to time invite member states to re-examine treaties that are no longer applicable and international conditions that may endanger world peace.' This aims to abolish all unequal treaties, enhance friendly relations between member states, and lay a solid foundation for world peace, which is consistent with today's slogan of reciprocity and equality. Consular jurisdiction is clearly an obstacle to international peace. This is the third reason why it must be abolished. We respectfully request that Your Excellency uphold the teachings of Sun Yat-sen, establish judicial dignity, and resolutely abolish consular jurisdiction, as a first step to break free from the shackles of unequal treaties. We are sincerely grateful. Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, respectfully bows."</p>
<h3>Explosion at the Intersection of Tiantong Road Injures Several People</h3>
<p>A sudden explosive device goes off while people are watching monkey tricks; thirteen people are injured, and the police are investigating.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:35 PM, an explosive device detonated at the open space at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Tiantong Road, injuring thirteen people. This was truly a tragic incident. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sudden Explosion</p>
<p>The open space next to the Yuanli Tea Shop at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Tiantong Road was created by demolishing buildings to construct city housing. Ji Banglu, a 23-year-old monkey trainer from Hebei, was performing there. People gathered to watch, forming a large crowd. Around 3:30 PM, as the audience was enjoying the monkey tricks, an explosive device suddenly appeared from an unknown location and exploded with a loud bang. The crowd scattered in all directions, but Ji Banglu, the monkey trainer, and thirteen spectators were injured.</p>
<p>Twelve People Injured</p>
<p>The patrolling officers from No. 1109 and No. 2284 in the vicinity heard the alarm and quickly arrived. They immediately called for ambulances and sent the injured to Shanghai Nursing Hospital and Tongren Hospital for treatment. The names and injuries of the injured are listed below: Ren Minquan (head injury), Xu Binzhen (left leg), Jiang Zhishang (right leg), Tang Kuifa (head), Tang Qingyu (head), Ji Banglu (both legs), Lu Weijun (left leg), Guo Peifa (right leg), Huang Gencai (cheek), Guo Longying (left foot), Han Yicheng (right thigh), Fang Genda (face), and another child whose name is unknown.</p>
<p>Police Investigate the Source</p>
<p>Of the injured, only Han Yicheng (23 years old, from Jiangbei, residing in Zhabei) required hospitalization due to the severity of his injuries. The remaining twelve were bandaged and released from the hospital by 6 PM last night. The police have ordered detectives to search pedestrians on all roads and are investigating the source of the explosive device. However, as of the time of this writing, no clues have been found. It is truly bizarre and unexpected.</p>
<h3>Sun Fuxiang Loses Both Wife and Money by Taking a Concubine</h3>
<p>Accuses Matchmakers of Releasing a Carrier Pigeon</p>
<p>Ma Shiying, an 18-year-old daughter of the Yu family of Nanjiazhai, 14th District, Lidong Village, was sold to Sun Fuxiang of Wangjiawan, 47th District, Banqiao Village, as a concubine last year, for 400 yuan. On February 5th of this year, Ma Yu and her two elder daughters arrived at Sun's house. On February 8th, they suddenly ran away with Ma Shiying, taking a large amount of property. Neighbors witnessed three men and two women carrying flashlights and leaving with packages in the middle of the night. Sun is now suing Ma Yu and her daughters, along with the original matchmaker, Han Shengnan, in court for releasing a carrier pigeon and escaping with the money.</p>
<h3>Young Widow Sues Her In-Laws for Encroachment</h3>
<p>And asks to break off relations, but the plaintiff has already remarried</p>
<p>Gu Yunzhen, a 23-year-old widow residing in Sanbao, 73rd household, Hehe Village, files a lawsuit in the local court against her in-laws, Kang Shiwen and Kang Qian (residing in Wubao, 5th household), for encroaching on her dowry. She claims that she married the defendant's son, Bo Shixian, in January 1934. Unfortunately, in July 1935, her husband drowned. Her in-laws blamed the misfortune on the ill-fated daughter-in-law and subjected her to abuse. Therefore, she requests that the court sever the relationship and return her dowry. However, the locks on the cabinets and chests have been replaced, and there is nothing inside. She then saw homespun cloth in the defendant's room. They strongly refused to return it. Due to the persuasion of the police in Tiqiao Town, they only transported a part of the empty items back. When she went to retrieve them again on the 8th of this month, she was beaten. She was turned over to the police station, but the prosecution was not pursued. Therefore, she requests a legal investigation, and so on. The defendants hired lawyer Lu Zhongqi to argue for compensation for reputational damage, stating that everything was clearly handed over under police supervision on February 26th of last year and that a receipt was issued. Unexpectedly, on March 8th, they brought a maid and took two of our private foot basins while we were ill and injured our daughter. Therefore, we were taken to court, but we withdrew the lawsuit to calm things down. Now she is falsely accusing us. So the lawsuit obviously has another purpose, and so on. She has already married Zhong Qinchuan of the Sixth District of Nanhui. Judge Yu Shanxiang heard the case yesterday morning. Because the testimonies differed, the court ordered that the hearing be rescheduled.</p>

<h3>Thorough Investigation of the Police Officer's Assault on a Journalist</h3>
<p>The replies are evasive and contradictory; the exercise of duties was an inappropriate act.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after the incident in which Zhai Yicheng, a member of the Shanghai Journalists Association, was assaulted by a police officer from the 16th Section, the Journalists Association has submitted a petition to the Municipal Government requesting an impartial investigation. The original text is as follows: "Submitting a petition requesting a fair and impartial investigation into the assault on a journalist by a police officer from the 16th Section of the Municipal Police Bureau: According to a letter from member Zhai Yicheng, 'On the morning of the 10th of this month, when the newly appointed Chairman of Guangdong, Wu Tiecheng, was leaving and inspecting the honor guard in Nanshi, Yicheng went to cover the news. When his car reached the intersection of Fahua Road in the 16th Section, he was stopped by a police officer. Yicheng immediately got out of the car to explain and showed his press card. However, the police officer, with a stern face, immediately punched Yicheng in the waist and took Yicheng to the head of the section, Huang Qiguang. Huang Qiguang, without asking any questions, scolded Yicheng. At the time, Yicheng tried his best to explain, but they ignored him and were completely unreasonable. Even if the area was a temporary restricted area, the section chief and others were ordered to manage traffic and should not abuse their power and insult pedestrians at will. Furthermore, Yicheng was not the only journalist heading to that area. Yicheng got out of the car to explain, but was unreasonably stopped. The section chief's attitude towards journalists was such that he even allowed the police officer to assault someone without stopping him. In the future, what guarantee will journalists have when covering news? Therefore, I am submitting a letter requesting an investigation into the above situation.' The association sent a letter to Cai, Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, on the 15th of this month, stating, 'Shanghai is tied to international observers and is in a leadership position in the country. Police officers are responsible for local public security and should be exemplary in following the law. Now, Huang Qiguang, the chief of the 16th Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, and others openly dared to disregard etiquette and assault a journalist in public view. It is not hard to imagine that they usually abuse their power and harm citizens. This not only betrays the Director's painstaking efforts to govern but also goes against the Supreme Leader's clear instructions to promote etiquette. It is imperative that the Director of the Bureau severely punish the police officer in question to appease public sentiment. This is a matter of public convenience.'" After the letter was sent, the 16th Section sent a letter on the 17th, stating, "We were surprised to read an article in the Ta Kung Pao about a police officer from the 16th Section assaulting a journalist. The official responsible for maintaining traffic that day was an inspector from the Supervisory Office of the Police Headquarters, not an officer directly under this Bureau. This does not conform to the facts in the report. In addition to reporting to the Police Headquarters, we are writing to request an investigation and correction." That evening, members from various newspapers reported that each newspaper had received a correction letter from the Municipal Police Bureau stating that the matter had been investigated and nothing had happened. On the 18th, member Zhai Yicheng sent a supplementary letter describing the situation, stating, "On the evening of the 10th of this month, Wu, the former mayor, expressed his congratulations on the President Coolidge liner, and Huang Qiguang, the chief of the 16th Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, was also on the ship. He admitted that an inspector had stopped him, but claimed that it was not within his duties and therefore did not stop it. The journalists who were on the ship to see off former Mayor Wu all heard this." On the 19th, the association received a reply from the Municipal Police Bureau stating, "The Bureau was ordered to provide special security in the honor guard area on the 10th of this month. Therefore, the police officer in charge of the area conducted routine checks on pedestrians and prohibited them from passing through the security area. This is a matter of responsibility in carrying out orders and should be understood. As for the assault on a person by a police officer, if it is true, it is inappropriate. We have ordered an investigation to verify it." Upon investigation, the matter is very clear, but the Municipal Police Bureau and its subordinate 16th Section are shirking their responsibilities. The letter from the Municipal Police Bureau received by the association on the 19th stated that it would be investigated to verify it, but the letter sent to the newspapers on the 17th claimed that the matter had been investigated and nothing had happened. The contradictions and denial of facts are perplexing. We dare to ask Your Excellency to send someone to investigate thoroughly in order to appease public opinion. Furthermore, since the area where former Mayor Wu was inspecting the honor guard did not involve military secrets, even if pedestrians were prohibited from passing through, journalists performing their duties should be given access. Police officers exercising their authority should have the proper courtesy and should not act so inappropriately. In addition to punishing the police officer in question, please inform your subordinates to avoid similar unfortunate events from happening again. This is for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to Yu, Acting Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government."</p>

<h3>How Can Universal Disarmament Be Achieved?</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The New History Society of New York, USA, recently held a "World Essay Prize" to raise human awareness of the major responsibility of destroying war before war destroys humanity, inviting people from all countries to participate in the competition in order to promote universal discussion and joint decision-making. This move is very meaningful. The topic is: "How can universal disarmament be achieved by mankind in the world?" It is indeed a major issue for eliminating war. However, precisely because the problem is significant, the solution is not easy either.</p>
<p>There is much to be explored in writing an essay. We can appeal to all countries in the world to abandon their ambitions for aggression, open up confrontational situations, continue the work of the disarmament conference, and implement disarmament. Such arguments are naturally correct and just. But is it possible? In the past, didn't disarmament conferences make the greatest efforts? It was only because the countries participating in the discussions were not only insincere but even scheming against each other. Taking the cannon caliber as an example, Country A advocated 14 inches, while Country B insisted on 16 inches, resulting in a stalemate and disarmament turning into armament expansion. Currently, all countries are devoting their efforts to building warships and aircraft. It can be seen that asking the powers to implement disarmament is no different from asking a tiger for its skin.</p>
<p>However, are there no other methods? I believe there must be methods. The current situation is not afraid of the lack of methods, but afraid of having methods that cannot be implemented. Having methods is equivalent to not having methods. There is a Chinese saying called "talking strategy on paper." This saying means that it is better not to talk about something that can only be talked about but not used. However, this "World Essay Prize" has already begun to solicit entries from people from all countries. The competition is not subject to any restrictions, and essays can be written in various languages. When the time comes, excellent works will be comprehensively collected, and the results will be very considerable. As for whether the plans proposed by each individual can achieve universal disarmament, it is naturally also a question. However, the belief in individual security has failed, and the formation of a common concern system is not far away. To promote its early realization, holding an essay competition can take this opportunity to test the attitudes of people from various countries towards the overall world situation.</p>
<p>Finally, I ask the people of all countries: Do we want to sit and wait for war to destroy humanity? Or do we want to unite and destroy war before war destroys humanity?</p>
<h3>Great Joy Temple</h3>
<p>— Zhang Hai</p>
<p>Sleeping soundly, I was suddenly awakened by the piercing sound of a conch shell in the temple. It blew intermittently, making us, the strangers, a little surprised. I got up and asked an old lama, who said that this was the temple's command. The first three times were to urge people to get up, and the last three times were to summon the lamas to chant scriptures. It was like this all year round, without any change or interruption, just like the numb and mundane life of the lamas. The entire Inner Mongolian plains were numb.</p>
<p>After breakfast, the sun had already crossed the forest and shone on the earth. So we went to visit a lama's house. Entering through the main gate on the high wall, the courtyard inside was so spacious and quiet. The yurt was at the end of the courtyard, like a frightened hare crouching there, ready to run away. The yurt was silent. A lama wearing a cassock sat upright in front of the Buddhist altar, his eyes closed, not at all moved by our arrival. On the Buddhist altar were two small shrines with small bronze Buddhas inside. In front of them were rows of small bronze cups, neatly arranged, with the tea in the cups still steaming. The old Tibetan scriptures and Mongolian "Ten Thousand Year Calendar" were covered with dust, as if they hadn't been touched for several years. Finally, I noticed the beautiful carpet. The ancient patterns almost made me disbelieve that it was made by Mongolians. Everything was enough to prove that this lama was living a comfortable and superior life. The lamas know nothing and do nothing except chanting scriptures. Everything is at the command of the Buddha. Finally, we asked him to send someone to guide us to visit the "East Temple"—the Great Joy Temple—and he agreed without hesitation, even giving us three large carts to ride in. The carts were completely in the Gansu style, probably made by carpenters from "Gansu Maomu County."</p>
<p>The "Great Joy Temple" is the largest temple of the Beile Mansion, towering majestically on the green field. How quiet it is here! There are no horns, no sounds of livestock. In the blue sky and vast plains, we appear small and insignificant. But I feel very free. The fresh air gives us infinite pleasure.</p>
<p>The temple's architecture is half Chinese and half Western. The mountain gate faces east, and the Buddha hall leans against the west side. How is it that this temple looks like a Western-style building, with those layered windows. The exterior does not give people a sense of solemnity at all. Only after entering do you realize that there is only one floor. The ceiling is painted with many circles covered with drooping yellow silk cloth, shaped like large umbrellas, with ribbons hanging around them. In the center of the room is a seat more than three feet high, covered with a yellow satin cushion, with railings in front, a screen behind, and a square floral satin covering on top, with crimson-gold tassels hanging down. This seat is for the "Hutuktu" (Living Buddha) to sit on when he comes. A little to the left in front, there is another seat against the pillar, facing south, covered with a cushion, which is for the Beile to sit on. Similarly, there is also a seat on the right, facing south, which is for the "Grand Lama." In front of the floor, there are two rows of seats for the monks to sit on. To the right of the large seat is a large table, on which bronze Buddhas are offered. Countless Buddha statues are hanging on the walls. In the corner of the wall, there is a sedan chair, exactly the same as the sedan chairs used by high officials in the late Qing Dynasty. It is said that once a year, the bronze Buddha rides in the sedan chair, carried by several people, around the temple for a week, and the people who carry it can avoid disasters and get rid of diseases. There are also parasols, large drums, large horns, etc., which are all used for special annual meetings. Going into another room, there are many glass cabinets against the wall, containing many large and small bronze Buddhas. Some are several feet high, and some are as small as two or three inches. In addition, two cabinets contain "220 copies of the Diamond Sutra," and other scriptures are wrapped in yellow cloth. There is also a Buddhist shrine, with Buddha statues that look like plaster statues, in front of which are eight rows of bronze bowls, each containing different things: the first row on the left contains fried noodles, shaped like cones, for the Buddha to eat. The second row contains clear water for the Buddha to rinse his mouth. The third row contains Tibetan incense for the Buddha to smell. In the middle are a few small lamb fat lamps to brighten the Buddha's eyes. The fourth row contains snow lotus and other flower shapes for the Buddha's beauty. In addition, there are tea, refreshments, and everything else, which is truly laughable. The lamas extract from the herdsmen and spend it on these meaningless purposes.</p>
<p>Upstairs, there is a platform in front, with a bell-shaped bronze piece that is two feet high, and a bronze wheel in the middle that is more than three feet high. There is also a unicorn with horse ears and a sheep tail, it is not known what kind of beast it is. Behind the platform, there are various bronze Buddhas and Buddha statues. Among the bronze Buddhas, there is a "Happy Buddha," with a naked man and woman embracing, without a single thread of clothing. When going downstairs, passing through a side door, there is a wooden revolving wheel, five or six feet high, with small bells hanging on it. There is a stick on the side. Every time it turns once, the bell rings. The walls of the two corridors are painted with the four great Vajras. The windows, doors, beams, and pillars are all painted in five colors, with golden Indian characters. The Mongolians we saw on the road live very simply, but the temple is so magnificent, which is truly unexpected. It is said that this temple was built in the late Qing Dynasty, so it is still magnificent and strong to this day.</p>
<p>Next to the temple is a wooden house in the shape of a Mongolian yurt, with a mud wall outside and a dozen windows around it. Twenty or thirty lamas are chanting scriptures inside, wearing red clothes and red cloths, muttering in their mouths. Among the lamas, there are even eleven or twelve-year-old children as little lamas, burying their youth in kneeling and chanting scriptures, which is truly pitiful and regrettable! Inside the house is a large bronze pagoda, two feet high, gilded on the outside, and containing the ashes of living Buddhas and eminent monks inside. There are flowers made of pure gold and jade, etc., which are of great value.</p>
<p>The lamas chant scriptures every day: twice in the morning, once early in the morning, and once at eleven o'clock. When chanting, they beat large drums, shake small drums, blow trumpets, beat bronze drums, shake bells, and sprinkle water with peacock feathers.</p>
<p>When leaving the Great Joy Temple, we deeply sighed at the numb life of the Mongolians.</p>
<h3>Buying a Ticket</h3>
<p>— By Ma Mengchen</p>
<h3>Occasional Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Qian Yi</p>
<p>The Final Sale of Human Sentiment</p>
<p>Last month, I had to go to the Fourth Avenue almost every day to buy some cheap books from a few bookstores. Therefore, on the steps in front of the Kaiming Bookstore, I often encountered a man holding a letter in his hand.</p>
<p>This man was about forty years old. Although his clothes were a bit tattered, his speech was not very vulgar. His face was pale and white, like that of an opium addict. He was holding the kind of Chinese-style envelope that cost two copper coins each, with the words "Please deliver to Mr. So-and-so at a certain place in Caojiadu" written on the front. On the left was the style of "Sent from Liaoning XX."</p>
<p>He walked along the steps, and when he saw someone coming towards him, he politely handed the letter to you:</p>
<p>"Excuse me, sir: Where is Caojiadu?"</p>
<p>Before you could finish telling him, his words came again:</p>
<p>"Sir: I'm from Liaoning. It's pitiful. I'm all alone here, without a penny to my name… Could you lend me a few cents for the fare?…"</p>
<p>In this way, his intention was very clear. Moreover, he always performed the same script in that place every day. People who encountered him several times also understood his skills better.</p>
<p>Even the last remaining compassion of mankind has been sold.—I couldn't help but sigh in my heart.</p>
<p>In this society of ours, where commodities dominate everything, where can we dig up a trace of true humanity? And who can reveal a little bit of their own true emotions?</p>
<h3>A Small Matter on the Street</h3>
<p>— Shizhu</p>
<p>Old Wu moved a step with his leather shoes and said:</p>
<p>"Let's go, what's so interesting to watch here?"</p>
<p>But I still stuck my head in the crowd, raised my chin, and watched like I was watching a deity, wondering what the constable was going to do to this poor garbage collector.</p>
<p>The deity held the pistol behind his butt with his left hand, and pointed the wooden stick in his other hand at the poor man's nose, ordering him to go to the police station.</p>
<p>The poor ghost was uncooperative, shrinking and squatting there, looking at him, looking at the tattered clothes on his body, the basket in his hand, and the iron tongs.</p>
<p>The deity knew that it would not be enough to show his supernatural powers and true skills to achieve "So, he just used the stick to smash a few times, and the poor ghost did indeed" Ouch!" Mama ouch: Lord" was unbearable, but he shrank his body even smaller, sitting on the ground like a lump of cow dung.</p>
<p>This vaudeville farce made the audience laugh. I wanted to show obedience to the majority and laugh too, but I opened my mouth and couldn't laugh.</p>
<p>A fat man wearing a melon-shaped hat told me:</p>
<p>"This guy doesn't pick up garbage, he climbs up the window to steal things, and was caught by the patrol."</p>
<p>Stupid thief! How can you steal during the day? I cursed him in my heart.</p>
<p>"Pig, why don't you get out!" The deity came again a few times with force.</p>
<p>"Lord! I really… please… ·"</p>
<p>The deity frowned and dragged the tattered clothes away; the clothes were torn, and he dragged the basket away. The audience saw the tears in the poor ghost's eyes about to flow out, and some laughed again.</p>
<p>Old Wu also tugged at my gown to get me to leave, just like the constable dragged the poor ghost.</p>
<p>The play was over, and the audience dispersed satisfied. But some seemed to have a lingering aftertaste and talked as they walked to help the remaining fun:</p>
<p>"Alas, it's better not to be a good person and be a thief, it's really born." An old man wearing a mandarin jacket shook his head very indignantly.</p>
<p>"Thieves, the best way is to beat them! That fat gentleman wearing a melon-shaped hat echoed the old man with a theorem. Touching his belly.</p>
<p>"It's also very sinful…"</p>
<p>"This is a guy who doesn't do honest work."</p>
<p>A young couple in student style—or maybe lovers—were muttering while covering their noses.</p>
<p>But there was a rickshaw puller scolding the constable:</p>
<p>"Fuck your mother!"</p>
<p>A few children were saying:</p>
<p>"The constables are very bad!"</p>
