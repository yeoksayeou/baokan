<p>厦門通信、此間近發現盜採軍用鑛產案關係國家主權及軍用違禁、至深日鉅亟為各方所注意兹紀其始末如次</p>
<p>礦區素描</p>

<p>盜採經過</p>
<p>據被捕之該案關係人盧贊程供稱‘因見竹坑湖山峯突起知有礦產、故於去年九月間、山其舅李英魁介紹林能隱·黃馬奇·楊戇獅·及一不知姓名者、共組建興源礦務合作社、并由英魁介紹李文英任礦師、因目下尚未正式開採故未報告政府’查盧為該礦務合作社之經理人、又據簽約之竹坑湖楊氏總代表楊福彬供稱、‘該山係本社公有、開礦事乃由楊戇獅所介紹、因其父年老、故由我代表接頭、去年十二月二十三四日立約、議定如開有礦、公潤百分之十七、未立契約前、已開十五六天、嗣後他們所開何礦、并不知悉、主持開鑛的係安溪人李文英、住鼓浪嶼’、又據盧氏稱、‘技師李文英之籍貫、彼實不知、僅悉常往台灣活動　已、李現仟安溪中興礦務公司技師、現在安溪抑在鼓浪嶼渠亦未悉’查各地礦產、未經政府許可、私人不得擅自採掘、政府早有通令、且技師李文英之籍貫莫明、證之盧楊二人之供詞、又多含糊、其中底蘊、賓人令人探索之必要、兹再將盧楊一人所簽訂之開礦合約鈔綠於下、</p>
<p>開礦合約</p>
<p>“立合約字人建與源礦務合作社、竹坑湖楊氏總代表楊福彬、兹緣建興源合作社聘礦師隨處試探礦物以備開採、兹於上月間、曾探得厦門禾山竹坑湖社前面山頭土名塞仔山內有發現一種礦產、尚未審查切實、未敢明指為何物為此向該社管理人等磋商明約、由建興源合作社負責人出資試探、凡一切向官廳請准立案種種費用、均先由建興源合作社支理、與該社管理人無關、將來若非得有成績之時、兩方將此合約取消作廢、如果探得有成績時、該社管理人等、可得本合作社優先權百分之十七分、”派一人為該社管理人之代表、二人參加賑務、而該社管理人等願將該山礦物由建興源合作社採取、該山之高低曲直、不得限制、凡一切運輸道路出人如公山公地均應予合作社之便、若私人田園、由合作社支理、該社管理人不得藉口事端刁難等情、此係雙方願意、各　抑勒反悔、恐口無據、同立合約字一樣兩紙、各執一紙為據、’其後由盧楊二人及見證人保長甲長簽名蓋印、此一幕盜礦祕劇、於是導演成矣、</p>
<p>發覺緣由</p>
<p>此案之發覺、由星光日報社迭接密報謂㊀禾山湖裹社於數月前有‘友邦’人士及所謂‘特殊人’等、常結隊至該社漫遊或藉名野獵、或假託釣魚、惟個中眞情、不得而知㊁湖裹社已發現礦物、其質極良、為軍需工業之主要原料、且其容量甚豐、㊂現已有人組織達興源公司、實行探測、惟未得政府准許、故探測工作、極為祕密、㊃鑛物近已陸續運出、由湖裹及豪頭社交界處運至海傍然後以大船裝運、向澳頭方面出海而去、於是該報乃派員於十九日下午一時前往查訪途中適與江頭警察署劉署長等相遇、蓋彼等亦已得報、正擬前往調查、乃相率抵達鑛區、取出鑛物一方、同時由劉署長將該案重要關係人盧贊程楊福彬帶回、於是此盜鑛案、乃愈顯露於世、</p>
<p>事後處置</p>
<p>此案自暴露後、連日來黨政要員、如特派員陳聯芬、市長李時霖·省水警總隊長李國典等、均相繼前往路勘、其處置辦法、除將已捕獲之關係人盧楊等看管外、并嚴密偵緝其他重要人犯如李文英等、以便歸案究辦、至於已開掘之鑛坑、恐再被人繼續盜掘、已由警察分署派人嚴密守護、一面并由劉署長電省府向陳聯報告、</p>

<h3>傳作義之抗戰報告</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>綏遠主席傳作義。於前日紀念週席上。有沉痛之報告。傳氏以一身膺邊防之重寄。任救國之前驅。其言論與風采。為舉國所屬目。矧當今日。烽火緊急。警訊頻傳。家戶旁皇。人心不定之際。有此堅毅慨切之表示。足為前綫部屬資策厲。雖在遠道迢遞。讀之亦復神往。吾人於循覺之餘。覺有不能已於言者。輒就詞旨。一申論之。</p>
<p>傳氏報告中最扼要之點。卽在‘吾人應澈底覺悟。勿再予敵人以侵略機會。’並稱。‘敵來侵略我。是我們先給敵人造下了機會。並非敵人完全靠他的力量。’蓋傳氏鑒於前方匪偽之活躍。胥由國內不靖所召致。此於搜獲之匪偽文件中。已有切實之證明。尤以最近西安事變之發生。在彼竟認為發展之機會。事之痛心。宜無逾此。故不憚反復闡明。使部屬有所警惕。其實一致對外之目標。久為舉國所公認。閱牆禦侮。義難並存。物腐蟲生。勢有固然。凡此淺顯意識。孰不洞稔其義。大聲疾呼之下。未嘗不收微效。今以前綫抗敵之領袖。根據搜獲之文件。發為慷慨之演説。促起後方之注意。其所給予之影響。宜史有足以敦頑而立懦者。試問冰天雪地之中。衝鋒肉搏之下。所遭遇之艱險如何。所犧牲之血肉又如何。孰非同胞。任丁斯厄。若方人士。猶未能竟相忍為國之志。堅一致對外之念。使敵人有發展侵略之機會。而予前綫將士以更難招架之壁壘。自非喪狂。當不至此。傳氏垂涕而道。固吾人所應切實諦聽者也。</p>
<p>其次。傳氏以為。‘今天的中國人。應當下决心。不以利害來决定我們的行動。而應以犧牲精神來博取最後的勝利。此言尤足為今日對症之藥石。蓋在大多數國人之心理。無不以利害為衡準之前提。而於估計準備之際。又無不以物質為較量之先著。一經考盧之下。常覺勝算難操。由是委曲周旋。步步讓人。餘勇未賣。中氣先餒。雖謂勢有使然。亦計算過求精密有以致之也。實則處今日危逼之時局。甯復有利害可計較。兵法所謂置諸死地而後生。固吾人目前應採之步驟。具沉舟之决心。方足以言戰。絕瓦全之存念。乃得以救亡。傳氏所稱紅格爾圖之役。我以兩連之騎兵。當匪偽六七千人之猛攻以來福槍抵禦敵方飛機大砲之轟擊。而卒能取得最後之勝利者。豈非一鼓作氣之力實克斡旋之乎。惟願全國上下。後俱能斟納傳氏之言。以人心與精神。戰勝一切。袪畏葸之觀念。絕苟安之心理。下犧牲之决心。為救亡之奮鬥。復興國家。其在斯乎。</p>

<h3>日新內閣謀妥恊避免解散議會</h3>
<p>閣議討論政策大綱　預算案期圓滿成立</p>
<p>［東京］政府於二日閣議、恊議議會之休會或解散、及預算案等議會對策、三日上午十時復開臨時閣議、决定其根本方針、政府於二日下午邀請衆議院書記長田口至首相官邸、而與山崎農相·大橋書記官長·川越法制局長官第、恊議在議會中應取手續問題及其對策、其結果政府希望與政黨恊力進行議事、又在可能之範國內、避免實行解散等強硬方針及奏請停會等手段、而似切望得議會各派之諒解後、繼續休會、以便明年度預算圓滿成立、故政府事實上之方針、擬將廣田內閣之預算由義會撤回、加以修正後復提議會、以期通過議會、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］關於林新內閣縣而未决之議會解散問題、閣內之大勢、大抵主張此時解散、政府方面無積極的决定態度之必要、須充分觀察至議會再開時止、軍部及政黨之態度動向及其他客觀的各情勢後、再謀善處之法、蓋務必與議會恊調、撤回前內閣所提出之豫算案及其他重要法案等、由政府方面再加檢討、須修正者則修正之、避免無謂之磨擦、以漸進的謀一新庶政、卽以此為根本方針云（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林內閣為决定政綱政策及議會對策等起見、三日上午十時在首相官邸開臨時閣議、林首相及閣員全部出席、附議下列各項、决定後、於午後零時二十分散會、卽</p>
<p>㊀‘議會休會問題’、要求貴衆兩院自動的休會至二月十日止、㊀‘預算案法律案處理問題’預算案法律案等、先行全部撤回、其必要者再行提出、㊀‘政務官問題’現在之政務官已全部提出辭呈、雖已正式决定免職、然政務官之制度是否存廢、則須愼重考慮、故暫不任命政務官、㊀‘政綱政策問題’、新內閣之政綱政策務必速向國民發表、正進行準備、惟須閣員於三日以內提出意見、卽以此為基礎、由大橋書記官長川越法制局長官起草原案、於兩三日中决定大綱、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］林銑十郎內閣今晨集議、决定撤回廣田內閣提交議會之預算案及其他法案、並請議會自動延長休會期十日、俾新閣得有餘時變更預算及共他議案、此外新閣决定內閣每日集議、直至議會重開時為止、俾得重行考盧政府之政策、</p>
<p>關於議會問題內閣暫不决定解散與否、將視政黨及陸軍之趨勢、然後釋明內閣之態度、但就內閣將撤回預算草案一點觀之、則似未抱有解散議會之意向、同時政友民政兩黨具極大之謹愼、雖無代表參與新閣、但認清局勢之嚴重、不欲對內閣施以正面之攻擊、昨日議會無黨籍議員、要求政友民政兩黨明白表示拒絕法西斯主義、擁護國會政治之態度、但政民兩黨僅允加以考慮、今晨各報社評、均對新閣表示充分疑慮及殷憂、又一部份人民指出岡田及廣由內閣至少在名義上可稱為舉國一致內閣、而林內閣則回至‘超然內閣’，是否能順利處理政治、不無疑問、一般人認為林銑十郎內閣所負最大之使命、僅在抑制前藏相馬塲所擬成增稅計劃之若干點、至對華政策如何、尚未加以討論、新閣政策泰半繫於新藏相結城豐太郎之推進力云、（三日中央社電）</p>
<h3>日議會延長休會</h3>
<p>政黨表示反對</p>
<p>［東京］自林銑十郎內閣會議、决定向議會請求延長休會期十日、俾得修改預算及其他議案後、各政黨及衆議院各派代表卽於今日午後舉行會議、通過不接受內閣所、提之請求、認為政府之理由不合法理、據彼等之意見、議會旣自廣田內閣辭職後、已被迫自動休會十一日之久、則新閣舉行親任式後、議會自應立卽復會、否則議會直等於自動放棄檢討政府議案之權、苟政府認為議會有停閉之必要、則應奏請日皇頒佈勅令、始能有效、聞內閣將奏請日皇頒佈停閉議會十日之勅令、惟議會抱負此種態度、殊未許樂觀也云、（中央社三日電）</p>
<p>［東京］民政黨於二日下午開總務會、由總裁及黨首腦部出席、關於對付林內閣與應付今後政局之態度、交換意見之結果、决定如此方針、</p>
<p>㊀對於林內閣維持毅然態度、依嚴正的是是非非主義、保持為公黨之體面、㊁待林內閣發表政策與政綱後、决定本黨態度、㊂則於政黨本來之使命、在議會中質問應為質問之問題、加以檢討、然後决定贊成或反對、而為努力以副國民之倚託、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］昭和會之窪井義道、春名政章·森肇·林路一等、從來主張解散昭和會、現因山崎達之輔脫離黨籍入閣、準備在適當機會一致離黨、（三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>外相人選</h3>
<p>齋藤博佐藤　兩人中擇一</p>
<p>［東京］林首相欲迅速確定外交政策、據謀獲專任之外相、目下對於此項人選、再三加、熟慮、且以議會續開在邇、故大致在三月上旬卽可决定專任之外相、而此項人選與林內閣所採取之外交政策內容、亦有重要關係、是以林首相在此兩日以來、連日與有田前外相會見、聽取前閣外交方針及其經過、以便决定今後之外交方針與外相人選、但關於專任外相、目下雖未至具體銓衡之時期、而林首相則擬迴避部外人員、當由大使階級中之現任外交官選任之、其人選仍不出乎駐美大使齊藤博與駐法大使佐藤尚武（預定三月二日歸國）、二者中當取其一、至於希望外交之轉變與部內人心一新者、據首相親近之一部分人士推薦齋藤大使之空氣頗形濃厚、外相之銓衡若何、卽可反映於新外交方針、頗為各界所注意者也、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］傳將任林內閣外相之駐美大使齊藤博、關於今後之動靜、二日發表談話云、離國已久、雖欲歸國然今春秩父宮行將來美、故在入秋以前、恐不歸國、目下尚不致變更此預定、（二日同盟電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］華盛頓星報今日載稱、日本駐美大使齊藤博調任日本外相實係日美關係繼續親善之佳兆、齊藤使美三年期內、日美友誼已益見密切、齊藤當能向其同僚説明日本軍閥反帝國主義者過份行動所引起美國人之疑懼云、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>結城藏相財政方針</h3>
<p>條正新預算案　舉價彌補不足</p>
<p>［東京］結城新藏相於三日之閣議散會後、關於十二年度預算案稅制整理案之處理方針、發表談話云、十二年度預算案達三十億四千萬元之鉅、於經濟界其他有相當之不良影響、余不能因而不變、故不能不修改之、惟於短期間之休會期間、技術的加以修正、殊非易事、故擬竭全力付之、如技術的有困難時、擬將一旦撤回之預算案、仍舊提出於再開之議會、而由政府向議會表明有修正預算案之意、與議會懇談、俟預算通過議會後、於會行預算採削减或節約之方法、議會似有修正預算案之意、卽各省大臣對於修正亦大體諒解、又稅制整理案余亦有修正之意、故關於撤回之法律案如認為無檢討之必要者、則單獨提出之、至預算因此而發生歲入不足時、其不足金額、一時暫以赤字公債彌補之、俟預算通過議會、然後於實行預算節約歲出以謀平衡、至國防預算因充分認識時局之故、大體不加以何等修正云、（三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>結城兼任拓相</h3>
<p>與廢省問題無關</p>
<p>［東京］結城兼拓相、三日午後三時與永田前拓相辦妥移交事務後、由永田氏力説拓務省為日本民族向外發展參謀本部、尤以大量移民於滿洲、在實踐上且有擴大拓務省之必要、認為不宜廢除拓務省、要求新拓相加以考慮、結城則謂藏相兼任拓相、其問題在人選困難、當與廢除問題無關、一切問題且俟議會閉幕後、再行善處云云、（三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>兩大國策</h3>
<p>電力與鋼鐵　務求其實現</p>
<p>［東京］林新內閣對於電力國家管理案之態度、因專任遞相尚未决定、尚無顯明表示、惟二日親任式後、山崎兼任遞信已言明、對於為國有或民有之事業形態、雖尚未達到結論、然反對維持現狀、且有統制之必要云、故縱令前內閣之電力關係法案雖提出於議會時或有修改、然充滿於法案內之統制強化之主旨、原則上必蹈襲之、且山崎兼任遞相曾明示電力國策之方向、謂發送電及配電雖無一貫統制之必要、然發送電之統制、則無議論之餘地云、一面民間當業者對於電力案之趨勢、雖未必遽抱樂觀、然因從來電氣業者及產業界之反對運動深入民間、於此確信之下、深期新內閣加以根本的修正、惟亦承認相當程度內、依國家權力發動之統制亦非得已云、（三日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］新商相伍堂為昭和製鋼所社長、其對於鐵鋼政策之認識頗深、伍堂就任商相後、卽表示對於鐵鋼問題傾注全力、以致惹起各方面之注目、前商相小川之日本製鐵公司中心主義發生破綻、而一部份人主張重新檢討鐵鋼國策之必要伍堂商相鑒於此事、擬先研究為鐵鋼國策中心之實體、並對於製鐵事業獎勵法之改正問題及其他附隨問題、加以檢討、又對於現正進行中之銑鐵販賣機關一元化問題、將注加倍努力、不但在需要供給問題、關於技術及資本亦力謀日滿兩國之圓滿恊力、（三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>改革行政機構</h3>
<p>擴充調查局入手　大橋暫兼任局長</p>
<p>［東京］政府在昨日閣議决定革除內閣調查局長官心得石渡而大橋書記官長兼任其職、林首相認調查局為實行國策之重要機關、而為實現前內閣所計劃之改革行政機構、設置總務廳等事起見、擬於早時擴充調查局、實行改組、強化其機能、故曾於組閣時、請河田烈就任調查局長官、然因河田以健康不勝為理由、謝絕就任、暫時命大橋兼任其職、同時進行專任長官之人選、（三日同盟電）</p>
<h3>美工人盤據廠屋法院判為違法</h3>
<p>限二十四小時退出　汽車工人準備反抗　陸軍彈壓如臨大敵</p>
<p>富林德　通用汽車公司罷工工人、盤據廠屋、迄未退出、公司當局爰向法院提起訴訟、要求將各該工人驅逐出廠、推事茄多拉受理之後、頃已裁定工人盤據廠屋之舉、乃屬非法行為、各該工人、應在二十四小時之內、退出廠屋、工人所組成之糾察隊、亦應予以解散云、同時州政府已派軍隊一千二百名、在外監視、不許工人家屬、對於廠內工人接濟食物云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］官塲方面今日對於法院判决驅逐富林德通用汽車公司廠中之留廠工人一事、並無表示、實業組織委員會領袖路易斯巴起程赴底特洛、臨行時曾稱、‘法院作此判决、其勿後悔可也’、羅斯福總統與報界談話之時、亦不允批評、惟悉勞工部長潘金斯女士、曾在富林德以最近之情形報告總統、目前白宮似尚堅持不干涉態度、惟有人以為倘密歇根州州長莫飛、不能設法使勞資雙方舉行會議、則總統或將不得不出而干涉、至於潘女士在國會所請授權政府傳詢勞資糾紛之證人一點、因議員多數反對、恐難於通過云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>富林德　公司方面對於罷工工人一千三百名、目為已被解職之工人、其留居廠內為非法盤據、並稱此次失業工人十三萬五千人之中、其願復工者幾佔全部百分之八十云、（中央社三日路透電）</p>

<h3>我駐日留學生監督處蔣君輝返國報告</h3>
<p>昨日晉京向敎部報告留日學務</p>
<p>我國駐日留學生監督處總務科長蔣君輝、前日由日返國、昨日赴京向敎部當局報告留日學務、記者咋日訪晤蔣氏於旅邸、據發表談話如次、㊀留日學生人數、前年最多時將近一萬、惟其中良莠不齊、因陳監督接任後、採取重質不重量之方針、（若盡為優秀分子則質量並重、益以日金暴漲、國際變化、種種關係、現在在日學生、不過最多時之一半、此等學生、品學方面雖未必盡是優良然大致能潔身自愛刻苦砥礪、不忘其出國求學之目的、近來復有一種新趨勢、卽陳監督重質不重量之方針經多次折衝之結果、除一二商業化學校、單為其自身利益設想尚陽諾陰違之外、其餘多數學校、已能瞭解而願來合作據某某等校當局面稱、監督處之地位為客、學校之地位為主客無表示、主人未便越俎、兹客卽不辭勞怨負責整頓、主人自應拋棄從來傍觀態度而盡量援助、學校方面有此表示、文敎行政當局、亦有如此論調、故鄙人認為留日學界前途極有希望將來自有品學兼優之留學生、一批一批回到祖國服務、</p>
<p>㊁留學生畢業後之出路問題、原與其個人實力有密切關係、陳監督一方面注意學生之實力培養、使服務時有能力可以從容應付、一方面復注意與各界取得聯絡、儘量供給人材、最近福建徵求獸醫、廣西徵求齒科畢業生欲監督處就留日學生中推薦尚未是有適當之人可以介紹也、</p>
<p>㊂日本警察原屬世界馳名惟警察學校僅二處、其一不收我國學生其收我國學生者名曰警察講習所、此校名稱雖不如專門大學之美、然敎管設備俱臻完密入學資格規定非現任警備以上之警官不收、儼然一軍官大學也、以某種關係、今年擬不收我國學生現監督處正在交涉、要求續收、未知能否達到目的、聞近來頗有以志願入該校而赴東者、希望在監督處交涉未經辦妥之前、切勿貿然出國、且未任警官之人、更勿抱此志願也、</p>
<p>㊃西安事變發生之時、留學生頗多恐慌、羣至大使館及監督處探聽稍息、其悲憤沉毅之態度、充分表演、共愛國之深、及愛國之殷、實值得欣慰而注意、</p>
<p>㊄自西安事變發生以來、災區及其附近學生、不論公費私費、一律斷絕經濟上之接濟、生活陷於異常不安、現監督處止在代向中央要求援助、而許大使素來仁慈為懷、見人飢溺、猶己飢溺、亦在多方設法希望國內對此等智識分子、特別重視蓋彼等設一旦失學而流落異邦、實為國家乏損失非僅彼等少數人之不幸也、</p>
<p>㊅未領留學證書學生之畢業資格證明問題、原與學生、有切身利害關係、彼等勢在必爭、監督處已再三要求上方許予通融未知結果如何、現學生甚信賴監督處之為彼等謀利益也</p>
<p>㊆監督處所最感困難者、為經費問題因此關係、各種預定工作尚難完全推行原有經費實在太少故、還移時科長以上、皆須捐俸、以充遷費平時為求工作順利起見、頗多對外應酬、一切費用非貼薪不辦、甚盼今後預算能增加也、（中央社）</p>

<h3>幾個有關英語敎學的中等敎育問題（六）</h3>
<p>— 王世杰</p>
<p>也相當的切迫、現在這種情形、相當的普遍、我們不能完全或者大部份歸咎於學生的不用功、也許用功不得其法、指導的敎員不好、也許敎材與敎授法都不適宜現行的英語課程、是中等學校課程的一部份、也經過幾次的修訂、現在各學校的敎材與敎授法大體上是根據這個課程標凖、我們如果要補救目前的情形、似乎應該對於敎材、敎授法與敎員二方面、都要謀一個根本的改良、然後中等學校的英語敎學、才有穩固的基礎、這個問題、包含不少專門的問題、尤其是近年來語言學上的研究結果、應當多少能以引用到這個問題上面、使我們對於這個問題能以獲得科學上的原則、再根據這原則提出改革的具體計劃、這些都有待於專家學者與敎員詳細的研究、才能决定、我們對於英語敎材、敎授法·敎員等個別問題、需要根據學理的解决、我們對於超乎各個問題與包括各個問題之全部問題、更需要一種富有建設性質的思想與態度、對於研究這個問題將來所取的方向、我個人有一點希望、並且我相信定有不少的人對於這點希望、表示同樣的感覺、這點希望就是改良中等學校的英語敎學必須與中等敎育、般的原則與目標相符合、如果我以上所説的中等敎育的幾種原則能以成立、中等學校英語敎學應當達到以下的幾種限度、㊀應當切合實用、很明顯的、譬如敎材中如果採取外國的事物、不如採取中國的事物為切合實用、敎授法也應當合乎中國學生的情形、㊁應富養成學生自修與自動研究的能力、此在英語敎學尤有提出來的必要因為要有這種能力、必須在中等學校時代將英語學到一種最低限度的程度、㊂應當顧到學生升學的需要、也應富顧到學生畢業後進入社會服務的需要、一方面使升學的學生能以研究高深的學問、方面為入社會服務於各種事業中下級幹部的學生、各因其事業之需要、培植穩固的基礎　今天大會到會的諸君與中國西方語學會的諸君、對於本問題定然特別關心、並將有不少的貢獻、中國西方語學會的工作與今天的大會、已經引起各方面的興趣與注意、所以我借此機會、提出幾點意見、供大家的考盧、並祝大會與中國西方語學會前途的成功、（完）</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>廠家從事抵回近期粉暴抬七分</p>
<p>昨日紛市、上午開盤後各月份呈初定繼則激漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大兩處、均回漲三四角左右、利物浦跌一便士零、當開價後、以洋麥報價、五有出入、人心尚呈定局、較前日祇一分零、惟二盤以後、市氣逐步高抬、本月份因有廠家抵回、及客戶略活、致買氣又活躍直前、三四月份則業外仍有吸收、亦隨之趨昂、迨至下午開盤、二三四月份人心、又逐大俏、本月份雖非交割時期、但交易所已因結賬之故、拍至五日為止、在此期間、各廠之現貨、當以結局之標凖市價為標凖、所以從事抽回、或與現貨有連繫之關係也、三月份因密近本月份、故亦暴抬七分半、四七月份、人心較定、祇好三四分云、</p>
<p>期麥為粉帶起</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈初平繼見高漲之態、因洋麥報價、互有上落、故初開市面與前日相仿、六七月份、反較小一分、旋以粉市回振、買氣亦轉活動、收盤時已好起三四分、迨至下午開盤、交易並未暢旺、祇以粉市無端抬漲、業內外人心、不免帶起、故各月份喊價又好三五分、惟業中人之推測、以為結賬已近交易所祇有一天交易、將來春節開盤、如無實銷之策動、恐市面仍不能穩站也、現貨因廠胃已停、故無見交云、</p>
<p>河米本街銷塲略旺</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、與前相仿、共到四十餘號、貨約八千餘石、內薄稻計二十餘號、本街銷塲較前略活、包胃有青島烟臺帮辦薄稻三千餘包、不過吃盤不鬆、所以結果市况呈平定之局、厚簿粳行情悉無榮辱、陰變元及蘆尖均平平、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各埠來船二十一二號、市上各種交易仍屬平淡、白粳高中之貨價平定、中下者又緊數分、早薄稻價挺秀、白元挺立、陰元定勢、各秈及其餘各貨均無甚上落、</p>
<p>秈米客方已多停辦</p>
<p>昨日客利到頭、續有長江各埠裝到、行家多已折樣、大部份已經休息、粵帮以前辦尚未裝清、年內恐無續辦、汕厦北洋各帮亦多停手、昨日祇有本街應酬江西米二千二百七十三包、溫州秈米二百五十包、其他亦未問訊、客販雖未出樣、然存底與到貨兩充、市面又轉平軟無神矣、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>生產有餘本月紗跌風可畏</p>
<p>紗市晨間大跌、午後轉趨平定、但現紗銷路因總結賬時期接近、客方購辦宣告停頓、故標紗同業目標一致觀跌、因紗廠生產之紗、兹有積剩、二月期交貸必旺、逢漲時拋賣、壓迫亦重、但多方雖有放出、然大部份尚未出籠、前途波瀾、仍在醖釀中、</p>
<p>賡豐晨賣午買</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一律下跌、近期跌勢劇烈、市塲傳言謂有大批現紗可交解、二則多頭有一部份附和者、業已出籠、因此檯面鬆懈、市價步開步落、賡豐又來巨量賣出、但徐某近日拖進、為額殊巨、印商仍在多頭地位也、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一元五七八角至二元八角、午後開盤、本月跌風尤熾、形勢殊虚、但遠月尚好、二盤本月仍平、遠期再漲二三角、迨至三盤、二月期錦昌突來拖進一千六百包忽漲七角、其餘月份牽入佳境、收盤二月再漲三角、遠期帶好、結果各月比上午收盤價漲二六角、錦昌賡豐晨賣午買、查賣出裕大二千五百五十包、恒益八百包、合興六百包、賡豐二千四百五十包、昶記一千二百包、元一二千一百包、森康八百五十包、豐泰八百包、大昌成六百包、買進錦昌一千二百五十包、吉豐七百包、大孚七百包、同孚九百包、興昌九百五十包、益昶一千二百五十包、泰昌一千二百包、永大一千一百包同和一千○五十包、長豐一千二百五十包、恊成五百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>紗銷不滿五百包</p>
<p>現紗銷塲異常清淡、查全日各帮買去統計僅四百三十四包、售價跌一元、各帮買額列下、</p>
<p>棉花近期一無上落</p>
<p>買賣似都在結束中</p>
<p>棉市始跌繼漲市態不脫盤旋之象、因經營者大都在結束中、故成交甚鮮、現棉生意變見沉寂、廠方停辦、各路來源愈見寥落、因內地花行紛紛停秤結賬矣、</p>
<p>多空均乏興趣</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月益呈呆滯無勁之象、良以海外棉市平庸、但塲內交易殊鮮、多空兩方皆無興趣測其趨勢、仍不脫盤旋之局面也、標花結果、各月比上日收磐價均跌五分至一·二角、午後開盤市情平靜、亳無精彩可言、一盤後散戶扒空較湧市盤徐徐回升、結果各月漲五分至一·二角、查賣出大豐一千九百擔明德一千擔、元一一千一百擔、長豐五千三白擔、永裕一千二百担、泰昌一千六百擔、買進合興二千七百擔生源一千一百擔、益康二千擔潤康一千四百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>
<p>現棉來源寥寥</p>
<p>現棉消費冷落、廠胃閉塞來源寥寥、姚花一百包、通花九十六包云、</p>
<p>美棉賣方頗占優勢</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况疲弱、各月跌一至五磅音、晨初、因各項物價跌落、國內外多頭一致了結、同時、汽中罷工仍未解决水災情形、有和緩現象塲內賣勢占優、據報密西西比河水量停漲、奧海奧河水量突落、因之一般前因水災消息而買進者、現均轉賣惟五月期至一角二分半時、同業買進、收盤前、聞汽車罷工消息順利、市况又堅、計現貨跌四磅音、期貨跌四至八磅音、英棉現貨跌八點、期貨跌六七點、印棉老多頭了結之額為同業所吸收、日本運費便利及奧姆辣到貨减少、引起二月期補空、其後交易稀少、市况平靜、計平果爾跌一·二五羅比、奧姆辣跌一·二五至二羅比、白羅溪跌一·七五至二羅比、原電錄左、（二日）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、三日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百二十七羅比、奧姆辣為二百Ｏ九羅比半、漲○·二五羅比、平果爾為一百八十三羅比、漲半羅比</p>

<p>英國套頭呢續有裝到</p>
<p>昨呢絨交易冷淡、現貨定貨均寂、同業中均盤貨收賬、預備總結束、而新貨呢絨、刻則續有到埠、以英國貨套頭呢占多數大半均係拆貨幫所指定聞下星期中、尚有續到云、</p>

<h3>乾繭出口問題</h3>
<p>— 錢天達</p>
<p>近年來，世界經濟逐漸回蘇，物價上騰，日美生絲價格暴漲，漸趨沒落時代之我國絲業，得此續命之湯，亦有欣欣向榮之勢。民二十四年全國生絲出口計九萬七千二百三十八包，較之二十三年之三萬二千九百七十七包，已增加兩倍有奇，若非原料缺乏，出口數量必更可觀。二十五年上海一埠出口生絲為四萬一千四百四十六包，較之二十三年雖有增加，比之二十四年，則反見减少，最大原因，亦惟受天時影響，春秋蠶牧成欠佳，原料不足，乾繭價格高昂，絲廠不數成本，致國外絲價高漲，我國無貨以應，大好良機，於以錯過，良可概也·</p>
<p>酒當此原料缺乏聲中，又有見利忘義之絲繭商，紛紛將大批乾繭裝運出口，致存底益薄，資本短拙之絲廠，遂被迫停工，千萬工人，頓告失業，國計民生所關至巨，讀一月二十八日申特特載欄金聲君之‘乾繭出口觀’，無異為乾繭出口者作辯護。作者以其所關國計民生者至巨，惡紫奪朱，有如骨梗在喉，不能已於言者，敢舉數點，與國內蠶絲專家，一研討之：</p>
<p>金聲君云：‘據作者所知，本市絲廠被迫停車之原因，並不在原料告罄，而在繭價不符，目下本市暨無錫兩處棧中堆存乾繭，尚有萬餘担之譜’。此語若稍知經濟原理之人，卽知其为不合理。吾人知市塲買賣，不能出供求律之範圍，但乾繭商與絲商之經營，其目的均在於獲利，同時絲廠購進乾繭，必顧及成本，若繭價超過絲價，决計不能成交，故乾繭少而價格贵，丝廠商獲利微尚可，若乾繭價格竟超過生絲價格（繭價不符），實為情理所無·至現市上所存出售乾繭，滬錫兩地，不足五千担，此係實際情形，非可虛構，卽以一萬担計，上海絲廠今年開工者六十家左右，每家平均繅絲車二百部，每車每天耗繭五斤，（假定每車每日出絲十六兩，乾繭毛折五百斤市秤，繅絲一担。）則萬担乾繭，尚不足滬上絲廠一月之用，但新繭登塲須在五月中旬，故原料不足，實絲廠業目前之致命打擊，况尚不足萬担之數乎？</p>
<p>乾繭出口，影響絲業，是已無庸多述，吾人試更從整個國家民族着想，生絲出口與乾繭出口，其性質亦顯然不同，乾繭為農產品，而生絲為半製品，吾國歷年來國際貿易之拂逆，其最大原因，在輸出多屬原料，而輸入以製成品為多。蓋原料與製造品為不等價之交換，生絲輸出，則製造時之一切工資費用，均由外人支付，國人多此一筆牧入，亦即增加一分資力，乾繭輸出則不然，吾人姑不論外人購入之後，作何應用，在吾國為少去一部製造原料，仝時亦即反映增加工人之失業，（至若乾繭生產過多，超過本國需要時，又當別論）尤丁此本國絲業原料缺乏，失業工人增加之際，吾人當然不贊同大批乾繭之裝運出口。</p>
<p>‘政府應以國際市塲規定本國繭價及絲價，不能以日本美國交易所市價作標凖，因上年春秋兩季，母擔均抬高五六十元’今國外最大絲市為日本之橫濱，神戶，美之紐約，法之里昂，舍此更無其他重要國際生絲市場，所謂國際市場，不知何所依據，據不佞所知上年春秋兩季所定繭價，倘屬允當，並無抬高五六十元之巨大差額。</p>
<p>金聲君以為吾國絲廠，以機械陳舊，不適繅製高級生絲，似為乾繭出口之唯一原因。其實近年來吾國製絲機械改進甚多，無錫各廠如永泰，華新，降昌，永盛，鼎昌，大成，等廠，均已完全改良，（上海諸廠金聲君已言之）可以繅製八十五分勻度（Evenness)以上之高級生絲，故此點亦非事實。</p>
<p>至云‘改善機械’，‘培植人才’等項，當然言之成理，但此數點，又似與本文無甚關係。至引雙宮，麥粉，棉布等為例，試問吾國果逢飢饉，民食不足，而有大批糧食出口，是否須加以阻止，此義至為淺明，不待辯別，則乾繭出口，又何獨不然。</p>
<p>以上所舉，就其立論上之大者言之，其他枝節小題，不勝枚舉為節省申報篇幅計，恕不詳述。</p>
<p>編者按：日前接金聲君來稿，述乾繭出口問題，當峙以製絲原料缺乏如此，而有此大宗出口，亦以為奇，因為之披露。今接錢天達君來稿，似乎以金聲君所言，為乾繭出口者作辯護，而有所糾正。在編者不論作者之為何如人，就文論文凡一問題之來，有能作深切之研究，於事亦大有裨益。惟於此次乾繭出口究屬何往，究作何用，至今猶未能明白，可以釋讀者之疑。而從整個之製絲工業著想，自亦反對乾繭出口。但如何保存原料不使外流，要非空言論爭所能解决，仍在絲繭商之能通力合作，精神相結，恢復蠶絲祖國巳失之基業；尤在絲廠商奮發有為，努力進取，於原料之採集，能三致意焉！</p>

<p>演講西南夷族問題</p>
<p>高玉柱女士、昨日下午五時、在中西電台演講‘西南夷族問題’、首由周邦俊致介紹詞、旋高女士卽用夷語講述、由喻杰才翻擇、兹錄演詞云、各界同胞、我們大中華民国、是由漢·滿·蒙·回·藏·及西南夷族、共同結合而成、但是有許多的人們、祇知道漢滿蒙回藏五個民族、而不知道還有一個很龐大的西南夷族、甚至有些人、連夷族這個名詞都不懂、這不是很笑話的嗎、又有些人、認為凡是西南各省的人、都是夷族、這是極端的錯誤、我們要知道、西南各省的內地、大部份都是漢人、還有些漢人、是與士人同化的、他們的文化生活種種、完全與國內的漢人、一樣的高尚優越、現在我們所講的夷族、是專指西南各省邊區的夷苗同胞而言、這些邊疆同胞、是我國最古老的民族、也就是中原最初的士人、數千年來、同着國內的先進漢族、是有深切的關係、就是與其他的各民旅、也有不少的關係、不過我們的西南夷族、因為僻居邊隅、交通阻塞、保守性過強、本身文化異常低落、不能與國內各民族、並駕齊驅、反而形成了現代的原始人類、化外之民、這是我們很可痛心的、説到西南夷苗的入口、散佈在滇·黔·川·康·各省邊區的、統計不下兩千萬、佔領着廣大肥沃的地土、蘊藏着極豐富的資源、如像山貨藥材·牧畜·森林·礦產·農業·等等、眞是指不勝指、可以説是中國數千年來未經開拓的一個處女地、比較起其他荒漠的邊疆地方來、眞是優越得多、尤其是數千萬夷苗英勇淳𣝢的民族性、更非任何民族所能比擬、所以有許多的人説、西南地位的強固、要成為中國的安歌拉、而物產的豐富、可以成為世界最偉大的工業區、又有些人説、夷苗是產生未來新文化的一個構成份子、西南與夷苗、是國防的生命綫、這種種的預期、實在是具備得有必須而特殊的條件、我們可以相信、完全有可以表現在事實上的可能性、關於西南夷族問題、在過去帝王時代、都是用羈糜政策、責成各地土司保士安民、相安無事、各地土司、因受國家恩典、始終愛戴、民國以後、國家多事、政府鞭長莫及、任其自生自滅、而邊地官吏之不賢貪污、民族間的歧視、外力的侵略誘惑、漸漸與內地隔離、夷苗同胞、在天災人禍種種的摧殘之下、痛苦一天比一天加深、邊地的紛擾、也就一天比一天嚴重、直接間接、就引起了國防上很大的問題、這是夷苗本身的不幸、也就是國家最大的隱憂、雖然在過去數年以來、有許多賢明的地方長官、力謀開發夷苗、鞏固國防、但是力量簿弱、很少成就、這是我們不能不引為遺憾的、現在國家統一、政令貫澈、舉國上下、都努力注意開發邊疆、鞏固國防、這是安內攘外的先著、也就是復興國家民族的途徑、此一次我們因為感到本身痛苦的深重、看着西南國際的危機、所以集結西南各地土司、一致擁護中央、推派我們遠道來京請願、半年以來、承蒙中央政府當局、對於西南邊疆夷苗、一視同仁、尤得國內同胞異常重視、咸以為開發西南夷苗、增厚國力、實為目前最要之圖、關於我們前後所陳述的西南夷苗敎養衛等種種講願意見、均蒙分別採納核辮、這是我們西南數千萬夷苗的幸福、也就是國家前途最大角希望、我們希望中央此種德意、始終貫澈下去、尤其希望我們的地方當局、本着中央給予我們的德意、為我們負起實際責任、盡量辦理、同時我們感覺到開發西南夷苗這個重而且大的問題、决不是以政府單獨的力量做得了、我們希望全國各界努刀恊助政府、我們歡迎學術界考察研究、我們歡迎國內及僑胞投資開發、我們歡迎國內人才到西南邊疆去服務、為國家民族犧牲奮鬭、共同來完成時代給予我們的新使命、</p>

<h3>珠崖二義</h3>
<p>— 鄭侃嬨</p>
<p>家庭裏許多悲劇是誤會所鑄成的，要破除誤會，全靠智慧與至誠。</p>
<p>這裏是一個很幸福的家庭—一對和美的年青夫妻，帶着一個可愛的小寶寶過日子——，可是自從太太生了病，一切好的現象都改變了·先生是一個很負責任的敎館老師，就是在新婚燕爾的時候，他也未曾有一天提早放學過。別的老師下午五點鐘已經在家裹吃晚飯，他呢，這個時候正在館裹收拾東西，凖備回來。他的太太非常諒解他，無論他怎樣晚回來，總是笑嘻嘻地歡迎他，等他回來才一塊吃飯。有了孩子，話更好説了。到時，她先把飯菜弄好放在蒸籠裹，然後抱着孩子跑到大門口去接她的先生。有時她痴想着她的幸福生活，太得意了，得意到忘形，先生走近來還不覺得。可是小孩不像她這樣，父親才在巷頭轉一個彎過來，小孩馬上便看見了，她一個手招父親來，一個手推母親去，雙脚一蹬一跳恨不得立卽就投到父親的懷裹去；同時她嘴裹不斷的嚷道：‘爸爸！快來！爸爸，快來抱寶寶！’等到他們趕到一塊，太太便對寶寶説道：‘寶寶，爸爸累了，快親親爸！’先生在這樣狂熱的歡迎中，快樂到説不出話來，站着讓寶寶親一親他，便假裝着拉寶寶笑，偷偷在寶寶的圍裙上擦乾他眼裹含着的淚。眞的，他感激到流淚了。</p>
<p>太太一病，情形便不這樣了她一天躺在床上，誰也懶得去理會。她怕寂寞，喜歡有人陪她。先生一上學去了，她就想他馬上回來，等到不耐煩，什麼疑慮都生出來了。她懷疑丈夫的愛，又怕自己會死。有時她甚至想‘假如我死的話，寶寶也得和我一塊去，我不能留一塊肉在人間受罪像萍兒呀！一想到萍兒，她害怕到了不得，不斷的打寒陣。</p>
<p>原來她有一個姪女叫做萍兒。萍兒三歲那年死了母親，父親第一年娶一個後母回來、後降非常的虐待她，飯不許她吃一頓飽，一年四季穿同樣的一套破衣裳。因為這個婦人潑辣得根，家裹的人都怕她，誰也不敢袒護萍兒來得罪她。那時萍兒的姑姑（就是剛才所説的那位有病的太太）年紀還小，當然更不敢開罪嫂嫂。她就是有時拿一點東西給萍兒吃，也要背着嫂嫂。她永遠記着萍兒那瑟瑟縮縮的可憐樣子。姑姑出嫁後第二個月萍兒便就死了。據説她因為不小心打破一個花瓶，後母罰她兩天不許吃飯，她餓得難受，悄悄地到廚房裹去偷貓飯吃。她怕人撞破，急急忙忙的胡亂嘔下去，不提防吃下一根大骨頭刺在顙子裏，不能上，不能落，當天就寒死了。</p>
<p>這個慘劇，她平常想着，也不知道，她流過多小淚，何况她現在又在病裹想著她嗎？本來有這樣一個活潑潑的小寶寶，很可以替病人破一破沉寂，使她開心的，無如她老是想著這件可怕的事情，有了一個小寶寶，反加增了她的痛苦。她這樣多心，病當然天一天的厲害了。</p>
<p>因為家裹沒人招呼病人和小孩，先生也只好天天提早一兩個鐘頭放學回家。他以為這樣幹太過分了，心裹總像擔當了很大的不是似的，非常艱受。回到家裹來，百事都急於需人，不知道應揀那一件先下手！小孩身上屎尿重重，哭嚷著要換；太太身邊的痰孟倒翻了，狼籍滿床，她也在哭著；早上在廚房裹煨的粥已經煮糊變成黃黑的顏色了，可是爐子一點煖氣都未有；浸了一個月那一盆髒衣服，發出很難聞的臭氣，令人踏進屋裹來就要吐；同時三個人穿著最後那一套衣裳，也髒到非換不可了。……他昏頭昏腦，忙了一個半天一個半夜，還弄不開。那一面太太忍受不住，開始埋怨了！</p>
<p>“阿初（小寶寶的名）的爸！我的命也捱不過幾天了，服侍一下我好不好呀？唉！找從早上想拉屎一直想到現在，因爲不會下床，也祕到現在。”先生聽見，慌忙跑過來，一面扶著她，一面説道：“你該早説呀！”太太有氣無力地伏在先生的身上説道：“不要説風凉話罷，問你，一整天，你那一刻是在我的身邊呢？早上，你走的時候，我哀求道，‘我怪寂寞呢，放一天學陪陪我罷！’你很無情的回我道：‘責任所在，這不能！’你回頭看見我難受，因此出主意騙我道：‘好妹妹，你是明白我的，難道你不曉得我最受你嗎？爲我忍耐一些；我今天一定提早放學回來。回來我講故事給你聽，替你開開心。’我眞傻，我就信了你的話，高高興興躺在床上等。不想一等等一個整天，天黑了還不見你回來，回來還想法子躲開我。得咯！你的心，我知道了！”説罷，嗚鳴咽咽的哭起來。</p>
<p>先生不像太太這樣好口才，他滿肚子裹都是理由，嘴裹説不出來。他早上臨走時，是答應過太太回來講做事給她聽，同時也説了兩三句安慰她的話，但並不像太太重編轉説出來這樣好聽。他急了半天，好容易使太太收住淚。他曉得現在該是他踐約的講故事的時候了，他替太太收拾好，鋪好被窩，便坐在𤴷沿邊問道：“你愛聽什麼？”太太照例發完脾氣，性情馬上變溫和些，她的眼角還是濕濕的，可是她的臉上已經露出些笑意，。雖然近視眼的先生，在微弱的燈光下，不會看得什麼出來，但他聽着她的柔聲婉言就知道她已經心平氣和了。她答道：“你不是説講故事嗎？我就愛聽故事。”</p>
<p>‘好，你愛聽故事，我就講故事；你愛聽故事，我就購故事…………’這兩句話他重重復復説了幾遍，嘴裹一面機械地説，心裹一面製道：‘講什麼故事給她聽？在那裏能找一個故事出來呢？’他正在想到入神，在床脚睡著的寶寶，醒來要尿了。他忙轉身去把她，她尿完，手指著嘴嚷道：‘娘，餓，寶寶要吃。’太太聽見，忙問先生道：‘寶寶還未吃嗎？’先生打了一個很長的呵久，才懶洋洋的答道：‘吃是吃過的，不過吃到半肚她便睡著了。’太太馬上臉色馬上沉起來。生氣道：‘都是你不會喂她，那裹能吃到一半便睡去呢？好人，看你故事不會講得出來，還是熱一點稀飯餵餵她罷！我也想吃一點呢。’先生聽見免了他不講故事，像得到大赦一般馬上蹓去了。</p>
<p>過了一會先生把稀飯端進來，太太和寶寶都已經熟睡了。先生不想驚擾學們，把這兩碗括飯放在米缸裹。此時柝聲已經打至最後的四下了，先生知道快轉五更，忙減燭上床睡覺。先生才糢糢糊糊睡著，忽然被太太的惡夢驚醒了。她雙手緊緊摟著先生不斷嚷‘萍兒，’像瘋了一樣，先生好容易才把她弄清醒了。太太醒來對先生哭道：‘你摸一摸我，我全身發燒到像火炭一樣。嫂嫂是這樣病死的，我知道我也快了。唉，將來寶寶也難免是一個萍兒！’她説罷號啕大哭起來。先生很明白她的憂慮所在，但不曉得怎樣安慰她才好，焦急了半天，然後附著太太的耳朶，低聲説道：‘你怕什麼？萬一，萬一，……，我不再娶就是了。’</p>
<p>這句話不知道太太究竟聽著未有，因為她什麼也未有表示，從此便入昏迷的狀態了。天明，先生還想上學去，無柰實在分不開身，只得托人到館裹去説一聲，自已整日在太太的身邊廝守著。有些厚道的𨼺人，聽見太太病危，都來探問幫忙，到了夜裹，太太便斷氣了。她因為早已昏迷，什麼遺囑也末有。小孩不懂事、以為娘睡著不理她，吵著要娘抱。送了葬不見娘回來，又天天哭著問爸爸要人。誰都説先生應該早些續娶了，但先生因為曾答應過太太不續娶，他不肯背約。有人替他做媒，他推辭道：‘死人待我有什麼錯？她才斷了這口氣，我怎忍就再要人！’他不敢把他守約績娶的决心苦人，他怕人笑他。</p>
<p>過了幾天，先生上館敎學去，孩子放不下，帶著一塊走。到了館裹孩子不斷哭嚷著回家找娘去，惹得大家都不好受，有些沒有娘的學生，都忍住眼淚。好容易來往幾天慣了，別的麻煩事情又來。先生正在説書解禮，孩子坐在旁邊聽得不耐煩，不是呌屎叫尿，便是打瞌睡摔下地了。先生對學生是最講尊嚴的，地受不了這樣傷體面的事，第二天只得把孩子鎖在家裹，不再帶她上書館去。可是等到他放學回到家裹來，孩子已經哭到聲嘶力竭，連爸爸也認不得了。他很傷心，左思右想，沒法妥置孩于，只得聽人話，再娶一位太太。他自己開解自己道：‘不肯續娶是為孩子；今日要續娶，也是為孩子。想可以對得住死者罷？’</p>
<p>他怕人家簿待他的孩子，四處去找賢淑的女人，他什麼也不論，只以賢淑為唯一的條件。結果他找到一個他認為合他理想的女人。這女人年長而醜，她因為未有兄弟。要自己力田奉養老親，所以不能及時出嫁。現在她的老親剛死了，她正愁滿肚子熱情，無處寄托。她和先生同裹，曉得他是一個忠厚人，因此一有人和她説合，她便答應了。</p>
<p>太太上門這一個晚上，新妝才卸了，先生便含著淚領著他的孩子去拜見後娘。他騙孩子道：‘初兒，你不是天天問我要娘嗎？現在娘回來了，你還不找她去？’孩子非常的高興。一面跟著父親跑來。一面嚷‘娘。’不想來到新屋中只看見一個陌生人坐在那裹，孩子馬上害怕起來，回頭要走。先生忙攔著她道：‘是娘，好孩子，來，呌娘！’孩子掙扎著要出去，哭嚷道：‘我要找娘去，這個不是娘，我要找娘去！’先生沒法，只得抱她出去。</p>
<p>先生去領小孩進來的當兒，太太便在屋裏預備好一堆糖菓給小孩吃、她是立心要做一個好後娘的，不想小孩一見面便不肯認她，令她很失望。不由她不記得姊姊的話來了。她出嫁前一天，姊姊對她説道：‘妹，我是一個後娘（她的姊姊也是嫁給人做後妻的，）我知道做後娘的滋味。把你的心肝割下來給前頭的兒女，他們也當作是狗肺呢，誰也以為後娘沒有一個好的，你就是做了好人世要白當不是。’當時她聽見姊姊的話不相信，她總以為，你拿做娘的心待前頭的兒女，他們就會待你像待親娘一樣了。現在她看見一個小小的女孩，也覺得這樣厭棄後娘，覺得姊姊的話，似乎有道理了。不過她仍然不肯就此灰心，她説：‘何必一定要人好待自己，自己好待人就是了。’過了一會，她自己又失笑起來道：‘她還是一個小孩子，懂得什麼？我這樣認眞，才是傻瓜！’</p>
<p>太太極力本巴結小孩，不上十天，小孩便和她弄得很熟了。小孩現在不用人敎，自然便叫‘娘’了。她很聽話，後娘吩咐她怎樣，她便怎樣，不像從前她的親娘在的進修，她這樣容易撒嬌撞賴了。她有時還得看看後娘的臉色，不用後娘開口，找後娘喜歡的事情幹去。如果有人部她，‘你是誰生的？’她會指著後娘道：‘是娘。’如果有人部她，‘你最愛誰？’，她會指著後娘道：‘我最愛娘。如果有人問她，’誰最漂亮？她會指著後娘道：‘娘最漂亮。’可是當著她單獨對著父親的時候，她會含著眼淚問他道：娘（這個當然是指她的親娘）斡嗎不回來？娘還回來嗎？’父親難過了一會，才答道：‘娘不是已經回來嗎？她天和你一塊，你還不認娘嗎？’小孩什麼話也不説，她很失望，悄悄地溜進從前娘住的舊屋子去，她撥開重重的蛛網，坐在一張積滿塵土的小椅上，望著堆滿破東西的舊木床説道：‘寶寶不淘氣了，娘，起來，給寶寶一塊香糖。’馬上她又裝著母親，改變口氣説道：‘好寶貝，好乖乖，娘就起來，香糖都給你。’那時父親已經悄悄地跟蹤　跡進來了。他看見這樣情形，忙把孩子抱上，忍不住心酸，哭出聲來。孩子一時糊塗了，以為眞的娘回家來，又哭又笑，大聲嚷娘，嚷個不止。</p>
<p>那時後娘正在廚房裹弄飯，她聽見哭鬧聲，忙趕出來。小孩看見後娘，害怕起來，馬上又清醒了。太太此時神經過敏起來，把事情猜錯了。他什麼話也不説，很生氣的跑回廚房來。她一面切菜，一面𠻨道：‘唉！眞是啞狗咬死人呀！看見他不聲不氣，總以為他對於我有相當滿意了，誰知道他懷著這樣的鬼胎！我有什麼薄待他前妻的女兒？值得父女兩人躱在死人的屋裹哭娘！’現在她又想著姊姊的話來了：‘誰也以為後娘沒有一個好的，你就是做了好人，也要白當不是。’但她是個倔強的人，不肯這樣容易認輸，她心裹雖然很難過，嘴裹還説：‘何必一定要人好待自己，自己好待人就是了。’她把飯弄好拿出來吃，照常歡歡喜喜的談笑，裝著一點介意也未有。</p>
<p>自此以後，太太待小孩更加客氣了，拿家裏最好的給她吃，給她穿，卽使她做錯了什麼事情，也從不説她一句。後姨這樣待她，謂理她應該很愛後娘，很高興的過日子才是。可是她眞奇怪，她看見後娘就害怕，整天小心謹愼的做人，一點小孩天眞活潑氣都未有。只有父親上了館，後娘下了廚，這個時候，她才覺得最自由快樂。她回頭無人，便會推開正屋的門，很高興的跳下台階去。她一個人跑出院子來的時候，照例是坐在棗樹下一塊小石上，雙手抱着小石前一塊大石，欹著頭望著蔚藍的天納悶。熱的小棗從樹上掉下她的身跟來，她也懶得檢來吃。她現在曉得娘不是出了門不回來，她是已經死了。至於死是什麼一回事，她當然不曉得。不過她知道死是等於一個人永遠藏起來，永遠不能再和親愛的人在一塊，所以她想著娘是死了，她便很傷心。她還很清楚記得娘是怎樣的，娘未死前，她們倆是常常坐在棗樹下的兩塊石頭上，娘剝棗給她吃，她唱歌給娘聽。月兒上來，爸爸在屋燈下改卷子，她和娘還是出院子來乘凉。她雖然坐得低低的，但因為娘不斷和她扇著，一個蚊兒也不敢來咬她。她愛月亮，更愛娘的臉兒，她看看月亮，跳起來摸摸娘的臉龐，手舞足蹈，樂到要下來。這種滋味，眞是棗兒不足以喻其甜，花兒不中以喻其香！</p>
<p>娘死了，這種滋味也完了。雖然她並不短少穿，但她不　得吃穿有什麼意義，她所需要的是深摯的熱情，和周密的注意。這些東西，只娘才能給她。她也曾試過想在後娘身上找些娘的好處來，結果她完全失望了。她越戀著娘的慈愛，越怕後娘的嚴威。這種威嚴是‘支配權’與‘疏忽性’所鑄成的。因為後娘有權支配小孩的一切，又懶得體貼她，小孩對於後娘，所以‘敬而遠之’了。太太知道小孩不向她，但她不曉得原因在那裹，她只認為這是前夫兒女待後她的常態，因此也不以為意了。</p>
<p>阿初七歲那一年，太太生下一個男孩子。太太是立心做一個好後娘的，當然她很小心設法避免對於兩個孩子的歧視，她總是故意要優待阿初。比方分橘子，她一定找大的給阿初，找小的給自己的兒子。但是很奇怪，無論如何，阿初不願（也許不敢）接受這樣的優待，她總是悄悄地和弟弟交換，要一個小的。</p>
<p>有一天，阿初病了，太太夜裏起來幾次看她去，可是一回床便睡着了。阿初病愈了不久，太太的兒子又病了，太太夜裏不起來看他，可是她整夜掛着他的病，不能睡着。她就在輾轉反側不能入寐的當兒想出道理來了。她想道：‘不怪我的兒子向我，阿初不向我，原來我眞的愛我親生的兒子多過愛她。阿初病，我能睡，兒子病，我不能睡，這就是證據呀。可是這是自然的天性，怎能改變呢？’她思量了許久，忽然想通了，説：“我過去一切實在太過矯情了。因為怕人説自己不好，做出來的都是敷衍面子的事，那裏有娘這樣待兒呢？我現在一定要改過，實事求是，眞的拿做娘的心待她，凡事為她設想，不求人家説我好話。”</p>
<p>太太果然是一個勇於改過的人，第二天起來她就改變態度了。她從前最不喜歡人家提及阿初的親娘，甚至阿初兩父女一塊坐久一點，也要設法把他們一個叫開，免得他們説到往事。現在太太曉得阿初還在憶及她的親娘，便常常和她談及她的親娘。特地請一個書家替死者寫一個追憶的　，把她生前用過的東西都整理出來，陳列在她死時的屋裹。天氣好的時候，太太又常常帶阿初省墓去。阿初哭娘，太太替她擦淚，好言安慰她。阿初凡事得到後娘的體貼，感情又有自由發洩的機會，漸漸便天眞活潑起來，不憂鬱，也不老想娘了。她曉得後娘是拿眞誠待她，她的心不知不覺也向了娘了。</p>
<p>阿初十三歲那年，鄉里説阿初的父親賢良，把他薦舉上去，朝廷便用了他做珠崖的縣官。不想他不服水土，到任三個月便病死了。阿初母子三人悲悲切切的扶柩回鄉。珠崖的民衆，感激先生做人好，許多人穿著白衣服送行，到了關口還不肯回頭。</p>
<p>珠崖是產珠的地方，政府立了一條法規，凡偷帶珠子入關的人受死刑。太太有一隻珠手釧，她知道不能帶牠出關，臨走時，怱怱忙忙把牠扔在地裹，不想她的兒子不懂事，拾起來，悄悄藏在母親的鐘奩裹。過關的時候，關吏搜查出來，拿了臟證當衆宣言道：‘誰是犯了法該死的，快説出來。’阿初以為一定是後母疏忽撞了禍，她記著後母待她好，想趁這個機會替她一死來報答她，忙走上前對關吏説道：“是我犯了法。這珠釧是娘的東西。娘臨去時把牠扔了，我拾不得把牠檢起來，放在娘的鏡奩裹，想不到牠會被查出來的。”太太聽見阿初的話，也眞以為是女兒犯法，但她捨不得女兒受死，同時她認為她不會把珠釧安置好，是她自己的過，不能讓女兒替她受罪，她也忙走上前對關吏解釋𨖩：“是我犯了法，不關女兒的事。我因為心傷事忙，臨走時記了把鏡奩裹的珠手釧拿出來。女兒捨不得我受死罪、甯可替我一死，所以她冒認了這個罪名。”阿初哭道：‘實在是我幹的，娘因為愛憐我，捨不得我受死罪，所以要替我。一母女兩人爭著死。關吏和送行的人，都感激到流下淚來。關史不願枉殺好人，只得把她們母女兩都放進關去了。</p>
<p>當著阿初母女自首的時候，阿初的弟弟扯著母親姊姊的衣袖狂哭著，他似乎有話要説，可是沒人理會他。等至入了關，他還是這樣狂哭著。母親姊姊走來安慰他，他才有機會把藏珠的事説出來。衆人曉得阿初母女都是未嘗犯罪而勇於死義的人，於是稱她們呌做蛛崖二義。</p>

<h3>‘貨幣的故事’（下）</h3>
<p>— 玉坡</p>
<p>—商務出版—</p>
<p>他對於貨幣的意義，下了雙重的解釋，這樣，我們對於千形萬象的貨幣，就有了一個相當的概念了。</p>
<p>隨在定義之後，他便開始來敘述最初的各種貨幣。他説：世界上最初的貨幣為貝殼；因為：貝殼是裝飾品，所以有被作為貨幣之可能。除貝殼之外，還有：石幣，魚齒，獸齒，啄木鳥的羽毛，家畜，烟草等，均能作為交易用的媒介。最奇怪的，如：巨大的石輪，亦能被人類當做貨幣使用，而且有著很人的信用。最後，他更談到了中國貨幣的源流，由刀幣，布幣，以至有孔的銅錢，最後才進化到了圓幣。並且，論到了漢武帝的所盛行的皮幣。至於他的結論是：這些最初的貨幣，都是千百年以前文明的產物；但是，現代有些、野蠻民族，却还仍旧使用着牠們。像他這樣用故事的寫法，來説明貨幣的最初形態，及其進化的途徑，對於缺少經濟學識的讀者，頗能引起研究的趣味。</p>
<p>其次，讓我們再來看看：‘放利——敎會與猶太人’一章吧。著者在章首，説明了利息的意義和起源；次敘述了古代政治家，宗敎家對終借貸所生利息的攻擊，把放債取息看為最不道德的，殘忍的，違返人性的行為，把放債者看為人類的蟊賊。於是，接著説明了猶太人在紀元前六十年卽已執歐洲金融牛耳，開始經營著放債取息的營業。他這樣説道：</p>
<p>威廉欲改造此種財政制度，使建立於貨幣之基礎上，不用不引用猶太人·蓋如是則於實物租稅收人之時，卽能刷猶太人處獲得現欵：同時納稅人手頭僅有實物而無現欵時，亦可由猶太人處商借現欵以完租稅也·（見第一百九十三頁）</p>
<p>最後，他指出了在現代經濟制度之下，放債取息已漸成了合法的事情；這是因為現社會制度是建設在黃金的基礎上的緣故。像他這樣根據史事，用社會學來考察放利問題，是很值得注意的。</p>
<p>總之，這本貨幣的故事有六個優點：㊀廣徵博引；㊁文字淺近；㊂有正確的見志；㊃兼用論文和故事兩種體裁；㊄每章之前提有概要；㊅可作為貨幣史和經濟學常識。如果著者能附以各種貨幣的插圖和照片，這本書就更覺得完美了。（完）</p>
<h3>外國名人的童年生活</h3>
<p>— 江鍶</p>
<p>沈子善沈瘦碧編　商務出版</p>
<p>近年來，國內的兒童文學有著新的開展，這已是一般的事實。成人的會用盡種種方法，為兒童們作一個發展身心鍵全意志的企圖，無論在學校敎育或社會敎育上；自然出版界對兒童們的關切，到近年來更益見嚴歷了。</p>
<p>出版界對兒童文學的特別注意的高潮，常遠在前年，無論那個書師，都得在兒童身上著想和打算一方面固然是商人的投機，但一方面由於時代的要求和兒童的需要，也是主要的原因。這個高潮　，年來雖然逐漸遞减鍶但幾家較大的書訪，仍是繼續印行這類書的，還是數見不鮮。</p>
<p>最近在商務買得了一册沈子善和沈瘦碧合編的外國名人的童年生活，我很感興趣的。很快地看完了。對於童年，我想任何人都得感到是寶貴的，也是不可再來的。當然，兒童們正需要我們用著成人追憶的熱情和寶貴的啟示，來盡量暗示他們，刺激他們。更由於兒童們需得在學齡時期，灌決他以新的活力，新的理想的人格，於是我們又不得不在這個時期裹，乘著他那並沒有給惡濁的社會薰染的心，來一個啟示。對於這，兒童們需要外國名人的童年，來個對照，當然是急迫而適宜的。商務的出版這本書，當也不無此意吧。</p>
<p>書名是一外國名人的童年生活一，其主題當然是名人的兒童時代的敘述。書中，總共包括二十一個名人，這些人在我們看起來，當然並不陌生。把這些名人來一個分析，可以得到一個概念是：文學家有二。沙士比亞，歌德：科學家約有八九人：愛迭生，牛頓，富蘭克林，瓦特，法拉第，達爾文等，政治家也包有五家，如加里波的，林肯，威爾遜，俾斯愛等，大將軍如興登保等，敎育家有福祿培爾。這里一個主要的傾向是偏生在科學家方面的，該是一個優美的提示。編者更用盡力地在文宇上用尚潔明凈的筆調寫出，實使兒童們不感到瑣煩之幣。</p>
<p>可是在這些優點裹，我却又發現著使人認為不能強意之點，首先是給讀者感到的，外國名人以二十一位來表徵，我覺得。並不夠的無論在以各國來分，以各個時代來分劃，來代表。在這裹，我們深感到材料的貧乏。中國自己的在國際或也歷史上有地位的名人，固早給書名的限制而被摑棄，但在國外儘有比這二十一位同樣有價值和有聲望的名人，或甚至比他們更高的，並非人選內。這種種憾，該得袖償的。其次，我又得感到接為於我們的現世界的人物祇童年生活缺乏，這使兒童們一時沉浸於過去歷史上的人物，該得到一個很壞的印像。</p>
<p>以整個的觀點，來評價這本册子，我又得説，其敘述固當以潔簡明凈為主，但以這種題材最好盡最的把他趣味化，用純文藝的筆，調來抒述，啟發。這操，以偉大的人性，以偉大的各時代各國名人童年生活故事化。趣味化，實要比這册單纯而枯燥的册子好得多了。</p>
<p>在這裹，我敬為成千萬的兒童們，祈求著一册理想的美滿的世界各國名人的童年生活出現！</p>
<h3>評‘送禮’的技巧</h3>
<p>— 萬石蘭</p>
<p>——東方雜誌新年號的一篇創作——</p>
<p>在動亂的中國文壇，一切的作家們的天才，都給企圖利用文舉作為實規某種慾望的人們淹滅得乾乾凈凈了；結果，白白地浪費了許多時間，而眞正的作品常因為作家門的急於求售，缺少較長時間的鍜鍊，不免便熱望著讀好書的青年們感到失望，所謂之藝的園地，永遠是產生不出菓子的石田，生長不出佳樹好花的沙漠。</p>
<p>最近，在東方雜誌的新年號，讀到王平陵的近作‘送禮’，使我像飢渴著好久的旅行者驟然得著甘臬似的欣喜，我很順利地讀下去，全扁約莫有兩萬多字的一個中篇，竟沒有遇著了故障，逼著我中途廢書興嘆，而是每一節每一段的情節，都有著新穎的趣味，誘到我毫不費力地讀完了，這可説是在近代中國文壇難得發現的寄蹟！</p>
<p>故事的Plot，是描述一個接連經過四次政變而永達能固其地位的會計科長，到第四次遇著立志要刷新法政的局長，然由於會計科長的不惜像拍賣塲的老關似的———拍賣了他的全人格，千方百計地設法修好於局長取親信的人們，終於便局長立志要刷新政治的好心，被阻檔於軟性的束縛，不克如願；而我們的會計科長在第四次的變動中依然是‘別來無恙’。這一個故事的曲折變化，以及出現在這故事中各個人物的個性，都給作者以最簡凈而毒辣的筆，活生生地在我們的眼前搖晃；而且每一個人物的動作，都能使讀者同時猜出主人公的心理，同時明白環境於主人公周圍的一羣人是在扮演著什麼玩藝，像這樣的手法，是運用電影上的Montage的手法，是立體的，不是半而的；是用動作來分祈心理的演法，而不是一種率直的解釋和乏味的敘述。‘送禮’在寫作的技巧上。的確是中國文壇的一個新動向。運用Montage的手法來處理作品的題材，的確是作家們所急須學習的一件工作。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“廣東精神”</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>近來一般日本人，特別是來游歷過中國，或在中國做外交官的，對於我們國家的觀感，漸有一種新的認識了。除却像某日人，説中國是‘匪國’而外，共餘的大都看得出現在的中國，已不是從前的中國。從前的中國，是常給人稱為‘老大的中國’，現在的中國，則是‘新的中國’，‘少年的中國’了。所以大家一討論及中日關係，他們的結論，總是呌他們本國人，對於中國要重新估價，而改變他們的外交政策。最近日本駐南京總領事須磨氏，調任返國，對日記者發表談話，其中有一段是這樣説：‘余在華已十一年，其間中國的情形轉變，激如狂濤，最感痛切的，以‘廣東精神’，為國民政府的中心，蔓延於全國。廣東精神的特徵，為不屈不撓的魂魄，與國權回復。’云云。</p>
<p>須磨氏對於中國下的這一個批評，可説是中肯的，是他在華十一年觀察得來的結論，中國近年的進步，正是這一種‘廣東精神’的發展。不但十一年來的中國這樣，自革命運動發生以後，這種精神，就早已在發動着了。辛亥革命我們是靠這種精神成功的，北代時代，我們也是靠這種精神成功的。至如近年的應付困難，現在的完成統一，及綏戰的勝利，莫不是這種精神的力量。而且這一種‘不屈不撓的魂魄’，也正如須磨氏所説，‘逐年深刻擴大，’今後並將‘漸次强固”。總括一句話説，今後中國的復興，必靠這種’廣東精神’來推進。這是我們中國人的自信，我們無論逢到如何重大的困難。我們都要以這種精神去克服，使國家能脫出險境，而進於民族復興的坦途。</p>
<p>末了我以為須磨氏説‘廣東精神’，大約想是因為廣東是中國革命的發源地，且現在我們政府的要人，大半是廣東人，故以‘廣東’二字代之。其實這一種‘不屈不撓的魂魄’，發展至今日，己成為全國普遍的現象，可稱為‘中華民族的精神’了。如何來發揮我們這種精神，這是每一個中國人，應發奮努力的。</p>
<h3>健美的女性</h3>
<p>— 明媚</p>
<p>健美的女性，時常能引起人的愛慕和敬重。</p>
<p>但是要成為一個健美的女性，並不是天生來就是健美的，她必須隨時的修養鍜鍊，並且要隨時克服自己體內的疾病，……</p>
<p>譬如她是患月經秘結，或是經來量少的，就應該購買通經活血的妙藥‘月月紅’吃。她是患體虛血虧，或者是經水不調的，就應該購買滋陰補虛的聖劑‘女界寶’吃，這樣，就不難成為一個健美的女性。</p>
<p>‘月月紅’和‘女界寶，都是五洲大藥房的出品，素為女界同胞擁戴，看了上圖，就可以明瞭了。</p>
<h3>‘日出’觀後感</h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>戲劇工作社在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>‘日出’和‘雷雨’比較起來，除了結構之外，‘日出’在各方面是都超過了‘雷雨’的，‘雷雨’的命運論太重，裹而的人物都是陰沉沉的，就是那要飛到新的世界去的周冲罷，也止於天眞，也太柔嫩，他有一個善良的靈魂，但是也沒經過暴風雨；至於這裹的方達生呢，他的質樸的所謂‘傻子’氣，是和周冲一樣的，但是他老練得多了，他看到了受欺詐受侮辱的一幫，但是他也看到了新的一羣，就像唱着夯歌，耐心地在打着基礎的那羣工人一樣，並且，他還不祇是一個旁觀者，他要跟金八夫拚一拚，他要白露跟他一起走，結果是卽使白露不走，他也昂首地走了。</p>
<p>這是一個可喜的進步。</p>
<p>作者是喜歡用象徵來表現他的主題的，他一再的提出一太陽昇起來了，黑暗留在後面。但是太陽不是我們的，我們要睡了。一在結尾，他也是用工人們‘高亢而洪壯’的軸歌，屋外的陽光和屋內的黑暗來結束。這樣的結束，在智識份子的觀衆來看，自然是韻味深長的，但在一般的觀衆是否能領略到呢？這却值得商榷了。‘我又看見一片新天新地，因為先前的天地已經過去’（作者在劇前摘錄的序言）作者較之在‘雷雨’中，是‘又看見一片新天新地的’，我希望他，祝福他能夠百尺竿頭，更上一步，像‘日出’中的方逹生那樣，跟惡勢力來拚上一拚。</p>
<p>茅盾先生批評‘日出’説：‘這是半殖民地金融資本的縮影。’由於這樣寫，我却由之連而想起茅盾先生的‘子夜’來了，是的，‘日出’正跟‘子夜’一樣，是替這半殖民地的金融資本（我記得‘子夜’是還涉得到民族資本的）剪下了一個很正確的影子的，不僅是主題上取材上有些近似，就是人物的性格上，也有些近似，‘子夜’中人物的名字我已記不清楚了，但是看了這裏的潘月臺和李石清，却立刻會想起‘子</p>
<h3>‘日出’中的一羣魔鬼</h3>

<p>夜”中的那個企業家和在罷工風潮中盡過大力的他的屬員來。自然，這不是説‘日出’是抄襲了‘子夜’這是‘日出’中的人物是從‘子夜’中摹下來的，我祇是想説他們有些雷同的地方，反正，用兩種方式來表現的作品，卽使有些偶同，也是並不損害到藝術的價值或社會的價值的。</p>
<p>自然‘日出’也有和‘子夜’不同的地方，我記得‘子夜’中是提到金融資本家的後面是還有怎樣的勢力操縱着的，而‘日出’中，這一點却沒有了，方達生要去拚的是無數的金八，在他拚的時候，他自然會發覺到無數的金八後面還有一個更大的支持者，但在還沒有拚之前，作者沒有在可能範圍中先向觀衆告訴一下金八後面的勢力，這不能不認為是一個遺憾的。</p>
<p>戲劇工作社演出的‘日出’，是經導演者歐陽予倩先生刪改而經過原著者的同意而演出的，最顯著的，是第三幕刪了，其他幾幕，因為還沒有把劇本重讀一遍，也記不起來，我翻過一下第四幕的收尾，才知道阿根（在舞台　是改　福　了　）的下塲被提　了，白露的自殺也給改了個房間，由此推想，旁的改動的地方，大概也不在少數罷？</p>
<p>在舞台上給我的‘日出’的印象，不知道怎樣，反而沒有讀劇本時的印象那般好，為了這個我曾經細細的想了一下，覺得這原因所在，大概是由於演出的時候太鬆了，所以倒反而沒有一口氣讀下去的時候緊張，例如那個可憐的書記黃省三的出場，我讀的時候便比看劇的時候緊張得多，（這當然不能全怪演員）還有，讀劇本的時候，關於戲的沉悶與否是不大容易感覺出來的，看的時候便不同了，‘日出’是否也如此呢？我以為倒不是的，因為這裹感到的並不是沉悶，而是鬆懈。雖然鬆懈的毛病，説不定也是在劇本上，例如人物多了，主線的發展給穿插妨碍了等，但是，空氣不夠濃厚，這原因則大概是應該由導演者負起來的。</p>
<p>空氣不夠濃厚，演員台詞與效果的生疏，大概是不為無因的，我看的是第一塲，坐在樓廳上，好幾次的聽到台後的提示。而有一次，因為等電話鈴響而使演員們也在台上窘了好些時候，這種種，都是是使空氣渙散下去的。自然，演熟了是能把這些缺點瀰補過來的，但沒有排練純熟就上演，這是太危險的。</p>
<p>演員們的演技，我很喜歡鳳子女士的陳白露，和高步霄的阿根，鳳子女士在第一二幕間的性格是統一的，在第三幕中，却好像有些變了，我嫌她太沉默了些，高步霄的阿根，他却給了我想不到的好。其他如崔士吉的潘月亭，丁伯騮的方達生，蘇菱的小東西，公孫旻的黃省三，莫言的李石清，都給我很不壞的印象，至於吳鐵翼的張喬治，我却嫌他太火了，黛麗莎的顧八奶奶和李顯京的胡四，則都不足些，這或許是由於讀劇本時對這三個角色印象太深的緣故，一搬上舞台，和意想中的人物不合，便不滿意了。</p>
<p>佈景是分兩截的，我並不覺得怎樣好，並且，似乎還嫌欠眞實一些，幕與幕之間的休息時間太長，卽是一景，這時間浪費得有些可惜；照明也並不好，沒有光源是一個原因，而忽而亮忽而暗，也使人太難過；讀劇本的時候，當我讀到最後的那叚東西：</p>
<p>砸夯的工人們高亢而洪壯地合唱着軸歌，（卽‘日出東來，滿天大紅，要得吃飯，就得做工’）沉重的石硪一下一下落在土裏，那聲音傳到觀衆的耳裹是一個大生命浩浩蕩蕩的前推，向前進，洋洋溢溢地充塞了宇宙。</p>
<p>我想，這一段效果是一定能使這個劇更出色，把作者的意思烘托出來的，但這次是配得太壞了，卽不够雄壯，又不够清楚，結果是把那個大生命的力量全消失了，甚望在以後的幾場戲裹，能够使他充實起來才好。</p>
<h3>養馬島之夜</h3>
<p>— 豐富</p>
<p>隨着日子溜走了的生活，是那般舒適，平靜無事。漸漸地大家給這平淡的生活弄膩了！誰都想調劑一下，最低得使生活起點波折，不然這樣下去會把人變成一塊木頭。</p>
<p>一天夜里命令下來了！呌我們這小兵盤開往渤海，要在烟台，龍口一帶擔任緝私工作！當夜艦長和上尉都先後給我們訓話。美麗的花朵開遍在每個弟兄的心田，這不是離開現在的海面而到渤海去調換空氣，而是去反抗敵人和漢奸—偉大的緝私工作！愉快，興奮，個個弟兄都精神活現。這一夜全沒睡着，砲手李庚在被窩裹细聲细氣的唱着‘十八摸’，小栓子坐在鋪頭擦槍，嘴裹不時嘟唸嘟語，看神氣他是已下决心要去殺敵似的！</p>
<p>通紅的太陽從東方躍起時，‘青天白日滿地紅’在悲壯的軍樂聲裹高升在空中，同太陽互相映照着。氣笛吼呌，烟囱在長空劃一道巨線，這樣我歡快的離开了‘劉公島’外港，向渤海前進！</p>
<p>軍艦開到‘腔峒岛’與‘芝罘島’之间停住了，據説這路綫當有走私船隻經過，拋錨就開始警戒。艦長和上校，蕭砲手官三個人在瞭望台上用望遠鏡往各處巡視。</p>
<p>無綫電收發員緊急報告，‘養馬島’海面上發現敵人走私船。艦長立刻下命令，起錨開往‘養馬島’去。</p>
<p>傍落日的辰光，我們的軍艦開到了‘養馬島’海面。撲空了！並不見敵人的走私船，跟陸地上的官方機關通電訊，也説沒有，昨天倒是有一隻裝私貨的中國船在這裹靠岸，因為有××人保護，當地負責機關也無可如何。弟兄們忿怒着！咒罵着！</p>
<p>無邊的海面上早已落下沉沉的黑夜來。天空沒有月亮，疏星霎着眼，好像嘲笑我們懦弱無能！清新的空氣，瀰漫着海面。一望幾千里茫茫大海，沒風沒浪。動人的美景和魔術家一般，正在那裹施出他底玄妙手段，這與‘劉公島’港灣的夜色不同，新鮮空氣任你呼吸，不由你不從精神上歡喜起來，再也不想睏睡。可是給人這樣大好景色的夜海，反倒像困倦的了不得，自己穩穩靜靜的睡着了。這時萬籁俱寂，祇聽見水浪在慢慢的流動。吐出了最安靜最可愛的波光，不住的向我們的艦舷輕輕的接吻。</p>
<p>夜半，發現一艘貨船向“養馬島”開來，艦長命令開艦去堵截，當向正在走着的貨船打了三次探照燈後，不料那船上竟開了一排槍，在黑暗裹，隔得又很遠，不知是不是描準我們這邊放的？這工夫砲手李庚直想開傢伙，然而命令不許。</p>
<p>那隻貨船吊轉方面走開了，這顯然是走私船了！按理説應該追上去，但是艦長命令在此拋錨，他説‘多一事不如少一事’，他們不在這裹上岸就沒有我們的責任！</p>
<p>大海酣睡着，星星怒視着我們這軍艦。</p>
<p>天剛亮時，無綫電接到龍口的報告：‘這裹來了一隻走私船，卸下五百包糖，三百五十件人造絲，一百八十箱瓷器’。</p>
<p>我們的軍艦就在‘養馬島’駐下，艦長依然抱着‘多一事不如少一事’主義呌我們在這小島的海面上緝私。</p>

<h3>Xi'an Order Restored After Brief Riot</h3>
<p>Radical Elements Forced Signatures on Orders, Suppressed by Yang Yufu and Others, Order Restored; Rumor that Wang Yizhe was Assassinated by Rioters</p>
<p>[Luoyang] On the afternoon of the 2nd, in Xi'an, radical elements among officers of Zhang's army, along with Sun Mingjiu, head of Zhang Xueliang's guard regiment, and others, separately petitioned senior generals such as Wang Yizhe, He Zhuguo, Yang Hucheng, and Yu Xuezhong, demanding three things: ㊀ opposition to the central government; ㊁ immediate commencement of attacks on the Central Army; ㊂ a resolution not to retreat or accept any conditions. They insisted that the drafted order to attack the Central Army be signed immediately. Wang and others sternly refused, stating that they had already issued orders to retreat and could not change them again. Sun Mingjiu and others were dissatisfied, and at 2 PM, they launched their actions, closing all the gates of Xi'an, setting up machine guns on the city walls, and completely cutting off or monitoring the telephones, telegraphs, and communications of important figures. They also fired shots everywhere as a show of force, causing temporary chaos. Gunfire continued throughout the night. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] The rioters in Xi'an gradually calmed down after Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others made every effort to suppress and persuade them. Telephones were restored by noon on the 3rd, and order had been restored. However, Wang Yizhe, commander of the 67th Army of the Northeast Army, who was ill at home, was assassinated by these individuals for refusing to sign a false order to stop the retreat and immediately attack the Central Army. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Minister He sent a telegram on the 3rd to express condolences to the family of Wang Yizhe, stating, "Director Yang Hucheng of Xi'an, please forward to Madam Wang Dingfang: I was deeply shocked and saddened to hear that Dingfang was killed in Shaanxi by rebels. Dingfang served and protected the country and always possessed deep loyalty. During the Xi'an Incident, he firmly upheld justice and obeyed the central government, which was admired by the people. I am deeply saddened by his sudden misfortune and send this telegram to express my condolences. I hope you will restrain your grief and assist in the great cause. I offer my most earnest prayers. He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration. Seal. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] According to reports, gunfire could still be heard in Xi'an on the 3rd, causing great panic. Telegraph and telephone communications between Zhengzhou and Shaanxi were cut off from the morning of the 2nd until night. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>⊙ Tongguan: Yang Hucheng's representatives, Li Zhigang and Wang Zongshan, have arrived in Tongguan again, accompanied by Xu Liang. Telegraph communications between Xi'an and Tongguan were again disrupted on the evening of the 2nd due to internal strife in Xi'an. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Zhang Yang Troops Retreating North and South of the Wei River</h3>
<p>Chishui Bridge Repaired Last Night; Zhang's Troops to Retreat into Gansu</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the aftermath of the Shaanxi-Gansu situation, it is reported that Zhang's and Yang's troops began withdrawing on the 2nd, with further withdrawal reports on the 3rd. Yang's troops stationed in the Huaxian area are expected to retreat to Sanyuan, and Zhang's troops will also retreat from Xianyang into Gansu. (Special dispatch on the 2nd)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to reports, the situation in Shaanxi has become smoother after the Xi'an conference. Zhang's and Yang's troops largely began withdrawing north last night. A Longhai Railway engineering train departed today to repair the roads to the west. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to reports from Tongguan, Gu Zhutong has repeatedly spoken with Yu Xuezhong by telephone in Tongguan, mediating on the Shaanxi situation. Yu stated that there would be no complications, and Yang's troops would withdraw from Xi'an soon. Telegraph communications between Xuzhou and Shaanxi are open and have not been interrupted. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] According to transportation sources, the Longhai Railway engineering team, upon reaching Yishui, immediately began repairing the damaged road sections. All four arches of the Chishui Bridge had been destroyed by Zhang's troops. After days of repair work by the team, it was restored on the evening of the 3rd. The road section west of Chishui is being repaired. The railway is currently rushing materials from various stations because the rails and sleepers were taken away by Zhang's and Yang's troops. It is estimated that it will take about a week to repair. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to reports, Zhang's and Yang's troops withdrew from the front lines at Chishui on the evening of the 2nd. Before leaving, they dismantled the power grid and removed the landmines. The Longhai Railway engineering team also departed on the morning of the 3rd to first repair the Chishui Bridge and the bombed railway tracks in Weinan. Qian Zongze has ordered the bridge to be repaired within three days. Trains have been concentrated in Tongguan and Huaxian, ready to travel directly to Xi'an. If Zhang's and Yang's troops relinquish Xi'an soon, traffic between Tongguan and Xi'an can be restored immediately. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The twists and turns of the Shaanxi situation have eased after Mi Chunlin and He Zhuguo continued discussions with Gu Zhutong in Tongguan, and after Yu Xuezhong flew from Lanzhou to Shaanxi to meet with Yang Hucheng. On the morning of the 3rd, a military organization received a telegram from Lanzhou relayed from Xi'an stating that the Shaanxi Zhang's and Yang's front-line troops, in accordance with the central government's plan, began withdrawing on the afternoon of the 2nd to a certain location. Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Gansu will return to Lanzhou to preside after Zhang Xueliang's troops leave the Shaanxi border. The new Gansu Pacification Director, Wang Shuchang, has decided to postpone his trip to Gansu due to family matters. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to transportation sources, the Tongguan-Xi'an section of the Longhai Railway is unlikely to open to traffic in the short term due to the destruction of the dams and bridges. The bridge, located twenty miles from Xi'an, is the largest of the entire railway bridge project. When Chairman Chiang left Xi'an, the railway bureau sent personnel to repair it, but the work was later suspended for some reason. Now that the Shaanxi situation has gradually improved, Qian Zongze, the director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, has arrived in Tongguan to direct the engineering train from Huaxian to repair the bridge. It will take more than a month or two to complete the work. In addition, the loss of the Xi'an railway station when it was bombed during the incident was approximately 200,000 yuan and must also be repaired. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Zhang's and Yang's troops in the Xiaoyi Zhen and Jiaoxie Zhen area on the north bank of the Wei River have withdrawn to the rear of their positions. The 105th Division at the Chishui position on the south bank of the Wei River has retreated to the vicinity of Weinan. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to reports, although there are many consultations on the issue of troop withdrawal from Xi'an, Yu Xuezhong, Wang Yizhe, He Zhuguo, Miao Chengliu, and others are willing to withdraw their troops as soon as possible. Zhang's special forces regiment, deeply instigated by the Communist Party, insisted on disobeying orders. Yang Hucheng, feeling isolated and weak, did not dare to resist alone. Therefore, he recently resolutely obeyed orders to withdraw troops. Since the 2nd, troops on the Weinan, Chishui, and Wei River's north bank lines have been withdrawn simultaneously. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Reactionary Organization Smashed in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Under the Direction of Certain Parties, Seeking to Disrupt; Zhang Zizhong Visits Song to Discuss Preventive Measures</p>
<p>[Tianjin] On the night of the 2nd, the Tianjin Police Bureau's detective team smashed a pseudo-Communist organization in the Cotton Clothing Street Bridge in Hedong and at No. 4 Daliujia Hutong, Fushu Street in the city, capturing the main culprits Guo Xiushan, Yang Yuan, and others. There were many accomplices and the search is ongoing. According to Yang's confession, they were subordinates of a certain former Zhili-Lu army and were recently directed by someone from the Great People's Park to set up a pseudo-Communist organization in Tianjin, distribute propaganda, and create rumors to plunge the city into panic. A certain country is using the pretext of anti-communism to conduct an expanded anti-communist plot against the authorities, not hesitating to use force if necessary. The authorities, after learning of this, have reported to Mayor Zhang Zizhong. Zhang rushed back to Tianjin on the afternoon of the 3rd to visit Song Zheyuan to discuss preventive measures during the Spring Festival. (Special dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Donations Continue to Arrive from All Quarters to Aid Suiyuan</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Finance Committee has received another 10,329 yuan and 16 fen in donations from all quarters, which have been handed over to the Central Bank for remittance to Chairman Fu. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Extends Leave by Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Central Political Council Approves and Sends Letter of Notification; Still Hoping Chiang Returns to Nanjing for Rest During Extended Leave; Chiang Visits Mount Mogan to Pay Respects at Huang Fu's Tomb</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Political Council held its 35th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. The members present were Wang Zhaoming, Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Lin Sen, Dai Chuanxian, Wang Luyi, Yu Youren, Chen Guofu, He Yingqin, Chen Bijun, Zhu Peide, Qin Zhen, Liang Secao, Wu Jingheng, Feng Yuxiang, Ma Chaojun, and more than twenty others.

<h3>Anhui Yarn Industry Strives to Reduce Tax Rates</h3>
<p>Business tax is particularly heavy compared to other provinces, which is only benefiting foreign merchants at the expense of domestic yarn businesses.</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The business tax rate in Anhui Province is stipulated to be 5 per mille for cotton yarn, which is higher than any other province. The Yarn Industry Guild of this province believes that yarn merchants have small profits and large capital and cannot afford the burden, and has repeatedly petitioned the authorities to reduce it, but has not been approved. Recently, with the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee about to be held, all yarn merchants gathered in Wuhu to discuss the matter and decided to send a letter to the Shanghai National Chinese Cotton Mill Joint Association, stating the reasons why the cotton yarn tax rate must be reduced, and requesting them to propose it for vigorous advocacy. The reasons they are fighting for are excerpted below: ① Cotton yarn that has already paid the consolidated tax is also subject to business tax at the place of sale. In principle, the tax rate should be the same in all provinces, regardless of whether it is light or heavy, in order to be fair. Now the Anhui Provincial Government is using a separate law as an excuse and setting the cotton yarn tax rate at 5 per mille, regardless of wholesale or retail, and taxing it at this rate. Cotton yarn has the lowest profit and the greatest risk. Now it is specially subjected to heavy taxes, and merchants cannot make ends meet and cannot afford the burden. ② The tax rate in neighboring provinces is only 2 per mille for cotton yarn, and the wholesale industry is taxed at half that rate, which has been implemented for a long time and there is a record to prove it. Anhui yarn merchants have repeatedly requested a reduction, citing the precedents of neighboring provinces, but have been rejected by the Anhui Provincial Government, which is acting willfully and ignoring the difficulties of merchants, leaving yarn merchants with no way to appeal and subject to slaughter. What treatment could be more unfair than this? ③ Wuhu yarn merchants have always focused on promoting domestic goods. Now, due to the heavy burden of business tax, the cost of yarn has increased, making it impossible to sell as much as possible. Moreover, in the same location, there are also foreign merchants selling foreign yarn, which is even more difficult to resist. Because our government has no jurisdiction over them, they do not bear any taxes and can sell as they please without any scruples. It can be seen that the impact of business tax on domestic yarn is by no means superficial. The tangible harm directly belongs to yarn merchants, indirectly to yarn mills, and the intangible harm is that foreign merchants sell one more piece of foreign currency, and the government loses one tax revenue. Why drive away the fish for the sake of the pond and implement this suicidal policy? ④ The Anhui Provincial Government encourages sericulture and reduces the tax rate on silk to 2 per mille, while cotton yarn is the raw material for ordinary cloth and is a universal need for ordinary people. However, its tax rate is higher than that of silk, which is a reversal of importance. We really don't know what the intention is. (2nd)</p>
<h3>A National of a Certain Country Discovered Mining Tungsten Ore Illegally Near Xiamen</h3>
<p>Colluding with traitors to organize cooperatives; those involved have now been arrested and placed under guard.</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: A case of illegally mining military ore has recently been discovered here, involving national sovereignty and prohibited military materials, with profound implications that are attracting attention from all parties. The details of its beginning and end are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mineral Area Sketch</p>
<p>The verified mining area is located at Jizi Mountain in Heshang Lake, Xiamen, about twenty miles from the city. The illegally mined pit is located at the center of the mountain, with several acres of farmland on the left and the sea of Wutong connected to the right. Behind the mountain is Haotou Village. The diameter of the pit is about one and a half zhang straight, about one zhang wide, and more than seven zhang deep. There is a triangular wooden frame with a wooden bridge running across it, and a pulley is installed on the frame with a long rope hanging down, presumably to lift and unload minerals. There is a bamboo ladder at the bottom of the pit, and two zhang are excavated deep to the left, with several copper gas lamps and tools such as hoes, shovels, and baskets. As for what the ore is, there are different opinions. Some say it is tungsten, some say it is steel, and some say it is manganese. It has now been sent to the Department of Construction for testing. According to the observation of the ore blocks by the general public, the color is grayish-black, which is more believable as tungsten. Tungsten is one of the metallic chemical elements, with a luster like steel. It can be drawn into silk and is very hard. When fused with carbon, it becomes even harder. When used to make objects, it can cut high-heat objects that ordinary steel cannot cut. The casting of military machinery and guns must be mixed with eight or nine percent of pure steel in order to expand and contract freely without exploding. All countries rely on it in industry, especially in military industry. Our country is the country with the largest production in the world market, and its reserves are also the best in the world. The Americas are second, Europe is next, and Japan has the least. It is said that the ore reserves in the mountain are also extremely rich, and if a thousand people mine it, it can supply it for at least twenty years.</p>
<p>Mining Process</p>
<p>According to the confession of Lu Zanheng, one of those arrested in the case, ‘Seeing the rising peak of Zhukeng Lake Mountain, I knew there were mineral resources, so in September of last year, I introduced Lin Nengyin, Huang Maqi, Yang Gangshi, and one unknown person through my uncle Li Yingkui to form the Jianxingyuan Mining Cooperative, and Yingkui introduced Li Wenying as a mining engineer. Because it has not been formally mined yet, it has not been reported to the government.’ It is found that Lu is the manager of the mining cooperative. According to Yang Fubin, the general representative of the Zhukeng Lake Yang Clan who signed the contract, ‘The mountain is owned by the clan. The mining was introduced by Yang Gangshi. Because his father is old, I represented him in contacting them. The contract was signed on December 23rd or 24th, agreeing that if mining is developed, the clan will receive 17 percent of the profits. It had been open for fifteen or sixteen days before the contract was signed. I don't know what mine they are mining afterwards. Li Wenying from Anxi is in charge of mining and lives in Gulangyu.’ According to Lu, ‘He does not know the origin of technician Li Wenying. He only knows that he often works in Taiwan. Li is now a technician at Anxi Zhongxing Mining Company. He does not know whether he is in Anxi or Gulangyu.’ Private individuals are not allowed to dig mines without government permission. The government has long issued a notice, and the origin of the technician Li Wenying is unknown. The confessions of Lu and Yang are also ambiguous. The implication requires exploration. The mining contract signed by Lu and Yang is copied below:</p>
<p>Mining Contract</p>
<p>“The contract is made by Jianxingyuan Mining Cooperative and Yang Fubin, the general representative of the Zhukeng Lake Yang Clan. Now, Jianxingyuan Cooperative hires a mining engineer to explore for minerals for mining. In the past month, it was discovered that there is a mineral in Saizai Mountain in front of Zhukeng Lake Village in Xiamen Heshan. It has not been carefully examined and dare not say what it is. Therefore, the managers of the village have discussed and agreed that the person in charge of the Jianxingyuan Cooperative will pay for the exploration. All expenses for applying to the official government for registration shall be paid by the Jianxingyuan Cooperative and shall not be related to the managers of the village. In the future, if there are no results, both parties will cancel this contract and invalidate it. If results are found, the managers of the village can obtain 17 percent of the priority rights of this cooperative.” One person is assigned as the representative of the managers of the village, and two people participate in the disaster relief. The managers of the village are willing to have the Jianxingyuan Cooperative collect the minerals from the mountain. The height and curvature of the mountain shall not be restricted. All transportation roads shall be convenient for the cooperative. If it is a private field or garden, it shall be paid by the cooperative. The managers of the village shall not make excuses to create trouble. This is the willingness of both parties. Each paper is held as proof. Then Lu and Yang and the witnesses, the village chief and the chief, signed and stamped. This secret drama of mining was directed and completed.</p>
<p>Discovery</p>
<p>The discovery of this case was due to repeated confidential reports from the Xingguang Daily, stating ① that several months ago, people from ‘friendly countries’ and so-called ‘special people’ in Heshang Lake Village often went to the village in teams to roam or under the name of hunting or fishing, but the truth is unknown; ② minerals have been discovered in Heshang Lake Village, and their quality is very good and it's a major raw material for military industry, and its capacity is very rich; ③ someone has organized Daxingyuan Company to carry out exploration, but without government approval, the exploration work is extremely secret; ④ the minerals have been continuously shipped out, transported from Huguo and Haotou Villages to the seashore, and then shipped by large ships to Aotou and then out to sea. Therefore, the newspaper sent staff to investigate at 1:00 PM on the 19th. On the way, they met Liu, the director of the Jiangtou Police Station, etc. They had also received reports and were planning to go to investigate, so they arrived at the mining area together, took out a mineral, and at the same time, Liu, the director, took Lu Zanheng and Yang Fubin, the important people involved in the case, back. Therefore, this mining theft case became more apparent to the world.</p>
<p>Subsequent Handling</p>
<p>Since the exposure of this case, party and government officials, such as Special Commissioner Chen Lianfen, Mayor Li Shilin, and Chief of the Provincial Water Police Corps Li Guodian, have successively gone to investigate. The handling methods, in addition to guarding the arrested people involved, Lu and Yang, and strictly investigating other important criminals such as Li Wenying, in order to bring them to justice, and to prevent the already excavated mining pits from being continuously stolen, the police branch has sent people to guard them strictly. At the same time, Liu, the director, telegraphed the provincial government to report to Chen Bao.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Chuan Zuoyi's Report on the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— All</p>
<p>Chuan Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan, gave a heartfelt report at the memorial week meeting the other day. Mr. Chuan bears the heavy responsibility of border defense and is at the forefront of national salvation. His words and demeanor are the focus of attention of the whole country. Especially today, when the flames of war are urgent and alarms are frequently sounded, when families are wandering and people's hearts are unsettled, his resolute and impassioned expression is enough to encourage the frontline subordinates. Even from afar, it is inspiring to read. In addition to following and feeling, we feel that we cannot help but say something. We will discuss it based on the wording and meaning.</p>
<p>The most important point in Mr. Chuan's report is that 'We should thoroughly realize that we must no longer give the enemy an opportunity to invade.' He also said, 'The enemy invades us because we first created opportunities for the enemy. It is not entirely relying on his strength.' Mr. Chuan believes that the activity of bandits and puppets in the front is caused by domestic unrest. This has been clearly proven in the captured bandit and puppet documents. Especially the recent Xi'an Incident was seen as an opportunity for development. The pain of the matter is unbearable. Therefore, he repeatedly clarified it to make his subordinates vigilant. In fact, the goal of consistent external resistance has long been recognized by the whole country. It is difficult to coexist and defend against insults. Rotting objects breed worms. This is a natural trend. Who does not understand the meaning of these simple consciousnesses? Yelling loudly does not always have a slight effect. Now, the leader of the frontline resistance, based on the documents he captured, gave a passionate speech to urge attention from the rear. The impact he gives should be enough to make the stubborn and establish the cowardly. Try to ask, what are the dangers encountered in the ice and snow, under the charge and hand-to-hand combat? What about the sacrificed flesh and blood? Who is not a compatriot? If the people of Fang can't even be patient and dedicate themselves to the country, insist on the idea of consistent external resistance, and give the enemy an opportunity to develop and invade, and give the frontline generals an even more difficult barrier to resist, they should not be like this unless they are crazy. Mr. Chuan said with tears, which is what we should listen to carefully.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Chuan believes that 'Chinese people today should make up their minds not to decide our actions based on interests, but to win the final victory with a spirit of sacrifice.' This statement is especially a medicine for the disease today. Most people in the country have the mentality of taking interests as the premise of measurement, and when estimating and preparing, they always take material things as the first comparison. After consideration, they often feel that they cannot control the chances of winning. Therefore, they are circumventing and accommodating and yielding step by step. They have not sold their remaining courage, and their middle energy has withered first. Although it is said that the situation has made it so, it is also due to overcalculation and precision. In fact, in today's dangerous and pressing situation, there is no interest to be calculated. The art of war says that those who are placed in a dead place will live afterwards. This is the step we should take at present. With the determination to sink the boat, we can speak of war. Only by cutting off the idea of complete tile preservation can we save the country. Mr. Chuan mentioned the battle of Honggetuer. We used two companies of cavalry to resist the fierce attack of six or seven thousand bandits and puppets with rifles to resist the bombing of enemy planes and artillery, and were able to win the final victory. Isn't it true that the power of one drum makes it possible to mediate? We only hope that the whole country, up and down, can all follow Mr. Chuan's words, and use people's hearts and spirits to overcome everything, dispel the concept of fear, abandon the psychology of temporary security, make the determination to sacrifice, and strive to save the country. The revival of the country is here.</p>
<h3>French Minister of the Army Announces Active Strengthening of Defense</h3>
<p>The Maginot Line extends to the Swiss border; two major arms factories are nationalized; the military budget is passed by the Chamber of Deputies.</p>
<p>[Paris] French Minister of the Army Daladier declared in the Chamber of Deputies today that the famous Maginot Line along the German border will be extended northward to the town of Dunkirk and will be increased in depth. The defense line along the Swiss Jura to the Alpine border will also be similarly extended. According to Mr. Da, he announced in the Chamber of Deputies on November 4 of the previous year that the Maginot Line would extend from the English Channel to Geneva on the Swiss border. Mr. Da declared today that this new plan will extend the length of the defense line from 250 miles to 500 miles. The French-Swiss border from Basel to Geneva, which is 120 miles long, has not been fortified, but it will now be protected. According to Mr. Da, this is for the purpose of defending against any foreign invasion of Swiss neutrality. Mr. Da also said that the large ammunition factory in Le Havre and a part of the Creusot factory will be nationalized before March. According to the Senate-amended draft law on the nationalization of the ordnance industry, it was passed by the Chamber of Deputies on August 11 of the previous year.</p>
<p>Mr. Da also told the Chamber of Deputies that he had submitted the following plans to the cabinet: ① compulsory youth training, ② strict training of reserve officers, ③ wartime industrial mobilization, ④ acceleration of mechanization, and ⑤ construction of major border highways. He then said, 'We firmly believe that the wars of Europe in the future will become a kind of civil war. We are now doing everything we can to avoid it, but it is our duty to make our country's borders impregnable. Germany currently has an army of one million men, and there are still strong reserve forces. Its air force and navy are the latest of the era and has a fixed industrial mobilization plan. Now, neighboring countries are actively preparing for war. France must not remain still and become a piece of meat on other people's cutting board. The recent labor strikes have delayed the progress of military preparations, but it is gratifying that production is now normal.' After Mr. Da's speech, the Chamber of Deputies passed the national defense expenditure bill by a vote of 405 to 186, with an amount equivalent to £140 million, to be raised in three years.

<h3>French Government Determined to Maintain the Republic</h3>
<p>Preventing Communist activities; domestic security is not a concern.</p>
<p>[Paris] At the Senate meeting today, Goldroux, a left-wing Republican senator, questioned the so-called 'Communist violation of the French-Russian non-aggression treaty and conspiracy to endanger national security.' It is said that he obtained a secret Communist notice, which contained the party's plan to organize defense agencies in the Paris region. All areas near Paris and the party's concentration points have been designated, and detailed plans are included. All party members, upon hearing a warning, will seize agencies such as the post and telecommunications headquarters. It is said, 'This is a plan to organize a civil war and should be punished by law.' He then mentioned the French-Russian non-aggression treaty signed on November 27, 1932, which stipulated that both signatories agreed not to interfere in each other's internal affairs, but the Soviet Union did not comply with this provision. Regarding the Spanish issue, he said, 'Although the government is implementing a non-interference policy, the Communist Party is doing the opposite. At this time, the Soviet Union is quite willing to establish a revolutionary nest in Spain, and its intention is to prompt Germany to advance towards our country in the Rhineland.' Then, Prime Minister Zalen replied that he also knew about the notice mentioned by Goudlou. The current issue is not about arguing about the realism or authenticity of this document. 'I am the head of the government and have no responsibility to explain it. If so, I am only speaking as a cabinet member who is responsible for domestic security. Is domestic security disrupted at this time? Are the various facilities of the republican system and the people's freedom threatened by the Communist Party's conspiracy? Although the newspapers of a certain country have propagated a lot about the situation in France, the streets in our country are passable as usual and there are no obstacles to block them. In a nutshell, the domestic situation is as normal as ever, and we are discussing in a peaceful atmosphere. So where is the so-called conspiracy? Are you afraid that this conspiracy will continue to be prepared in the dark? I dare to tell you that our duty is to expose and investigate all activities carried out in the dark. We have not failed in our duty in the past, and we will never allow this kind of activity in the future. The warning I am giving is to the public, and Mr. Goudlou's political friends may also wish to take note of it. In short, the current government is the government of the People's Front, supported by the majority, and the Communist Party is also in the majority, and has cooperated with the government in maintaining the political program. The government we have organized may not be what Mr. Goudlou wants, but it is a government that represents the national public opinion.' The Prime Minister concluded that after the February 6th Paris riots in 1934, our instinct to maintain the Republic was unleashed, and the People's Front was born because of this. The Senate then adjourned. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Intent to Adjust Relations with Turkey</h3>
<p>Foreign Ministers of Both Countries Meet in Milan</p>
<p>Milan, Italy – Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived in this city from Rome at approximately 6:00 PM today. Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü followed, arriving at 7:10 PM, and was welcomed by Ciano with due ceremony. The two are scheduled to meet twice tomorrow to discuss relations between the two countries. Rüştü will depart this Thursday to return to his country. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>Milan – The foreign ministers of Italy and Turkey held their first talks at 10:30 AM, lasting two hours. The Turkish ambassador to Italy, Râkıp, was also present. A second round of talks is scheduled for 5:00 PM this afternoon, after which a communiqué will be issued explaining the discussions. However, no immediate agreement is planned. Responsible sources have stated that the talks cover three issues: ⑴ The Italian Foreign Minister reiterated Italy's desire to maintain the status quo in the Mediterranean; ⑵ The Turkish government recognizes the Italian Empire (Turkey has de facto recognized the Italian Empire since withdrawing its minister from Abyssinia); ⑶ Negotiations on a bilateral trade agreement will proceed. Political circles say that the rapprochement between Italy and Turkey is a direct result of the understanding between Britain and Italy (referring to the Mediterranean Agreement signed by the two countries), but only with Germany's full consent. Italy's future policy towards Eastern European countries will likely be based on the trilateral relationship between Italy, Turkey, and Greece, while also approaching Yugoslavia. When this policy is implemented in the future, Italy will inevitably be associated with the Balkan Entente, i.e., the four countries of Turkey, Greece, Yugoslavia, and Romania. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the talks between Foreign Minister Ciano and Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü in Milan, the "Italian Daily" commented, "Our country has fulfilled many obligations to Turkey in the past, but Turkey still maintains a cold attitude towards us, almost to the point of hostility. For example, our country's construction of defensive fortifications on the island of Rhodes in the eastern Mediterranean is merely an exercise of its inherent sovereignty to protect our country's transportation to Abyssinia. Turkey at that time considered it a threat to their country. After the talks between the two foreign ministers, all kinds of barriers should be eliminated." It is reported that Ciano and Rüştü's talks in Milan will not only discuss Italy's signing of the Montreux Convention, but also involve the issue of Rhodes, Italy's dispatch of missionaries and establishment of schools in Turkey, and free trade between the two countries, etc. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>Discussing Two Current Issues</p>
<p>[London] The Cabinet held a meeting this morning, discussing the following two issues: ⑴ The issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War; ⑵ German leader Hitler's speech on the 30th of last month, especially regarding the demand for the restoration of former colonies. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding Hitler's recent speech, it was previously reported that the British government intended to seek supplementary explanations from Germany on certain points through diplomatic channels. However, according to diplomatic circles here, the government does not intend to do so. It is generally believed that the British government now intends to adopt a "wait-and-see" attitude for the time being, and take no diplomatic action, at least regarding the relationship between Germany and other European countries. (Vahas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Britain Returns to Post with New Instructions</h3>
<p>Demanding the Recovery of Former Territories</p>
<p>[Berlin] Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop recently returned to the country to report on his duties and is scheduled to return to his post tonight. It is reported that he carries a memorandum detailing Germany's demands for the recovery of colonies, and has received instructions from the government to study this issue with the British Foreign Office immediately after arriving in London. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Chile Organizes Economic Delegation to Japan</h3>
<p>Seeking to Develop Trade Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>Santiago, Chile – Senator Iraizola and the Deputy Ministers of Finance and Commerce have organized an economic delegation scheduled to travel to Japan on the 23rd of this month to examine trade relations between Japan and Chile and study ways to develop them. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Announces Acceptance of Disaster Relief Goods from Our Country</h3>
<p>And Orders Exemption from Import Duties. Floods Continue to Rise. Cairo, Illinois, Precariously Endangered</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt today ordered that friendly countries' donations for flood relief be accepted, and that the Treasury Department exempt such goods from import duties. Donations from China fall into this category. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>[London] King George and Queen Elizabeth today sent a telegram to President Roosevelt expressing their condolences for the floods in the United States. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>[New York] The safety of Cairo, Illinois, located at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers, will be determined within the next 24 hours. Today, the water level there suddenly rose again after a few hours of stagnation. The highest water level this morning was less than an hour away from the edge of the levee, causing great anxiety among the 6,000 rescue workers stationed there. The Mississippi River had shown no rise or fall yesterday for about seven hours, leading rescue workers to believe that the water level had reached its peak, but unexpectedly it continued to rise today, causing everyone to lose color. If the levee were to break, the entire city could be submerged in 20 feet of floodwater within hours. Patrols have now been increased, and members of the Coast Guard have also led 55 transport vessels to be stationed there. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Due to the severity of the disaster in the United States, President Roosevelt has implemented emergency measures, exempting all food, medicine, and other miscellaneous items donated from abroad for the relief of flood victims in the United States from import taxes. Cairo, Illinois, remains a dangerous area within the disaster zone. The river has risen sharply and is already at the edge of the seawall, actually higher than the roofs of the houses in the city. If the dams in the area at the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi rivers can withstand the impact of the raging waters, the lives and property of the Mississippi River basin can be considered safe. The Federal Survey Committee has begun inspecting the disaster situation in Memphis, Tennessee. According to the committee's latest report, nearly one million people have been forced to abandon their homes in the disaster area. This figure represents the largest disaster in American history.

<h3>The 33rd International Eucharistic Congress</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony Held in Manila Yesterday, Attended by 70,000 Representatives from 32 Countries</p>
<p>[Manila] The 33rd International Eucharistic Congress officially opened at 6:00 PM today in the sunset at Luneta Park, beginning with the reading of the Pope's blessing by Bishop Haiang of Belgium, Chairman of the Permanent Committee of the Eucharistic Congress. A total of 70,000 Catholic representatives and believers from all over the world participated in this congress, representing 32 countries. The ceremony ended at 8:05 PM, and all hotels and boarding houses in Manila were full. Schools and clubs were converted into dormitories to accommodate them. In addition, 15 ocean-going mail ships are docked in the harbor, serving as floating hotels. The most important representative is Cardinal Dougherty, the Pope's representative, who is currently the Archbishop of Philadelphia in the United States. After arriving here, he resided in the Presidential Palace as a guest of President Quezon. It is expected that 500,000 people will gather in the plazas of various churches and cathedrals on Sunday, the closing day of the congress, to receive the Pope's blessing. The blessing will be broadcast from Vatican City via radio and transmitted to the public via loudspeakers. Participants in the congress range from archbishops to ordinary people, of all social classes, truly a grand occasion. Most of the religious ceremonies of the congress will be held in the 'Immaculate Conception' Cathedral. The cathedral was completed in 1870 and has been rebuilt for the fifth time. The previous four buildings were destroyed by earthquakes, fires, and hurricanes. Travelers entering Manila Harbor can see its spire from afar. Tomorrow is Women's Day, Friday is Men's Day, and Saturday is Children's Day. On these three days, Holy Communion and other religious ceremonies will be held inside and outside the church. A parade will be held on the closing day, and Catholics from all over the world will hold prayer ceremonies in response to this congress. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Manila] The 33rd International Catholic Congress opened here today, attended by approximately 100,000 believers from 54 countries. Archbishop O'Doherty of Manila delivered a welcome speech to the representatives of various countries, saying that devout believers should sacrifice desires, time, and money for God's love. Then, the Pope's envoy, Cardinal Dougherty, Archbishop of Philadelphia in the United States, delivered a brief reply. Bishop Finnemann of Manila publicly read a telegram congratulating Pope Pius XI on his health and blessing the representatives present. The first day of the congress then closed. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<p>Manila – The World Catholic Congress is scheduled to open here at 6:00 PM today. The Far East Missionary Exposition has already opened at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, with the ceremony presided over by Cardinal Dougherty, Archbishop of Philadelphia in the United States, the representative sent by Pope Pius XI.

The universality of Catholicism can be expressed through this, and missionaries from various countries working in the Far East can be encouraged. We are very pleased to be able to participate in this grand event.' (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<h3>New Japanese Cabinet Seeks Compromise to Avoid Dissolving Parliament</h3>
<p>Cabinet Discusses Policy Outline, Aims for Successful Budget Passage</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At the cabinet meeting on the 2nd, the government discussed parliamentary countermeasures such as the adjournment or dissolution of parliament and the budget proposal. An extraordinary cabinet meeting was reopened at 10:00 AM on the 3rd to determine the fundamental direction. In the afternoon of the 2nd, the government invited Secretary-General Taguchi of the House of Representatives to the Prime Minister's official residence and conferred with Agriculture Minister Yamazaki, Chief Secretary Ohashi, and Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Kawagoe on the procedures and countermeasures to be taken in parliament. As a result, the government hopes to proceed with deliberations in cooperation with the political parties, and to avoid implementing strict measures such as dissolution or requesting adjournment within the possible scope. It seems to earnestly seek the understanding of the various factions in parliament to continue the adjournment so that the budget for the next fiscal year can be successfully passed. Therefore, the government's de facto policy is to withdraw the Hirota cabinet's budget from parliament, revise it, and then re-submit it to parliament in order to pass it through parliament. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the issue of dissolving parliament, which has yet to be decided by the new Hayashi cabinet, the general trend within the cabinet is to advocate dissolution at this time. The government side does not need to adopt a proactive decision-making attitude, and must fully observe the attitudes and movements of the military and political parties, as well as other objective circumstances, until the parliament reconvenes, and then seek a good way to deal with it. It is essential to coordinate with the parliament, withdraw the budget proposal and other important bills submitted by the previous cabinet, and re-examine them from the government's side. Revise those that need to be revised, avoid unnecessary friction, and gradually seek a new common administration, which is the fundamental policy. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hayashi cabinet opened an extraordinary cabinet meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 3rd to decide on the political program, policies, and parliamentary countermeasures. Prime Minister Hayashi and all cabinet members attended and deliberated on the following items. After the decisions were made, the meeting adjourned at 12:20 PM, namely:</p>
<p>㊀ 'Parliamentary Adjournment Issue': Requesting the House of Peers and the House of Representatives to voluntarily adjourn until February 10; ㊀ 'Handling of Budget Bills and Laws': All budget bills and laws will be withdrawn first, and those that are necessary will be re-submitted; ㊀ 'Issue of Parliamentary Vice-Ministers': The current parliamentary vice-ministers have all submitted their resignations. Although it has been formally decided to dismiss them, whether the system of parliamentary vice-ministers should be retained or abolished must be carefully considered, so parliamentary vice-ministers will not be appointed for the time being; ㊀ 'Political Program and Policy Issues': The new cabinet's political program and policies must be announced to the public as soon as possible and are being prepared. However, cabinet members must submit their opinions within three days, which will be used as the basis for Chief Secretary Ohashi and Director-General of the Legislative Bureau Kawagoe to draft the original plan, and the outline will be decided in two or three days. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hayashi Senjuro cabinet decided this morning to withdraw the budget proposal and other bills submitted to parliament by the Hirota cabinet, and to request parliament to voluntarily extend the adjournment period by ten days so that the new cabinet would have enough time to change the budget and other bills. In addition, the new cabinet decided to hold cabinet meetings every day until parliament reconvenes to re-examine the government's policies.</p>
<p>Regarding the parliamentary issue, the cabinet has not yet decided whether to dissolve it, and will clarify the cabinet's attitude after observing the trends of the political parties and the army. However, judging from the cabinet's withdrawal of the budget draft, it seems that it does not intend to dissolve parliament. At the same time, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are extremely cautious. Although no representatives participated in the new cabinet, they recognize the seriousness of the situation and do not want to launch a direct attack on the cabinet. Yesterday, non-partisan members of parliament demanded that the Seiyukai and Minseito parties clearly express their rejection of fascism and support for parliamentary politics, but the Seiyukai and Minseito parties only agreed to consider it. This morning's newspaper editorials all expressed full doubts and deep concerns about the new cabinet. Some people pointed out that the Okada and Hirota cabinets could at least be called national unity cabinets in name, while the Hayashi cabinet has returned to a 'transcendental cabinet'. Whether it can handle politics smoothly is doubtful. It is generally believed that the greatest mission of the Hayashi Senjuro cabinet is only to suppress some aspects of the tax increase plan proposed by former Finance Minister Baba. How to deal with the policy towards China has not yet been discussed. Most of the new cabinet's policies depend on the driving force of the new Finance Minister Yūki Toyotaro. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Parliament Extends Adjournment</h3>
<p>Political Parties Express Opposition</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the Hayashi Senjuro cabinet meeting decided to request parliament to extend the adjournment period by ten days to revise the budget and other bills, the various political parties and representatives of various factions in the House of Representatives held a meeting this afternoon and passed a resolution not to accept the cabinet's request, believing that the government's reasons were not legally valid. According to their opinion, parliament has already been forced to voluntarily adjourn for eleven days since the Hirota cabinet resigned. Therefore, parliament should reconvene immediately after the new cabinet holds its appointment ceremony. Otherwise, parliament is tantamount to voluntarily giving up the right to review government bills. If the government believes that parliament needs to be closed, it should request the Emperor to issue an edict to be effective. It is said that the cabinet will request the Emperor to issue an edict to close parliament for ten days, but it is not optimistic that parliament will hold this attitude. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Minseito Party held a general affairs meeting on the afternoon of the 2nd, attended by the president and party leaders. As a result of exchanging views on the attitude to deal with the Hayashi cabinet and cope with the political situation in the future, the following policy was decided:</p>
<p>㊀ Maintain a resolute attitude towards the Hayashi cabinet, adhere to strict right and wrong principles, and maintain the integrity of a public party; ㊁ Determine the party's attitude after the Hayashi cabinet announces its policies and political program; ㊂ Fulfill the party's original mission, question the issues that should be questioned in parliament, conduct examinations, and then decide whether to approve or oppose, and strive to live up to the trust of the people. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Yoshihiro Kuboi, Masaaki Haruna, Hajime Mori, and Rōichi Hayashi of the Showa Society have consistently advocated dissolving the Showa Society. Now that Tatsunosuke Yamazaki has left the party to join the cabinet, they are preparing to leave the party together at an appropriate opportunity. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Candidates for Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Either Saitō Hiroshi or Satō Naotake Will Be Chosen</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi wants to quickly determine foreign policy. According to reports, he is repeatedly considering the selection of a full-time Foreign Minister. As parliament will soon reconvene, it is likely that a full-time Foreign Minister can be decided in early March. The choice of this person is also important in relation to the content of the foreign policy adopted by the Hayashi cabinet. Therefore, Prime Minister Hayashi has been meeting with former Foreign Minister Arita these past two days to listen to the diplomatic policies of the previous cabinet and their process in order to decide on future foreign policies and the selection of a Foreign Minister. However, although it has not yet reached the stage of specific selection for a full-time Foreign Minister, Prime Minister Hayashi intends to avoid non-government personnel and select from current diplomats of the ambassadorial rank. The candidates are still either Ambassador to the United States Saitō Hiroshi or Ambassador to France Satō Naotake (scheduled to return home on March 2). As for those who hope for a change in diplomacy and a renewal of the department's personnel, the atmosphere of recommending Ambassador Saitō among a part of those close to the Prime Minister is quite strong. The selection of the Foreign Minister will reflect the new diplomatic policy, which is attracting much attention. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Washington] Ambassador to the United States Saitō Hiroshi, who is rumored to be appointed Foreign Minister of the Hayashi cabinet, made a statement on the 2nd regarding future developments: "I have been away from the country for a long time, and although I want to return home, Prince Chichibu will be coming to the United States this spring, so I am afraid I will not return home until the fall. There will be no change to this plan at this time." (Domei, 2nd)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Washington Star reported today that the appointment of Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saitō Hiroshi as Japanese Foreign Minister is a good omen for the continued friendship between Japan and the United States. During Saitō's three years in the United States, Japanese-American friendship has become closer. Saitō should be able to explain to his colleagues the fears of Americans caused by the excessive actions of Japanese militarists and anti-imperialists. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Finance Minister Yūki's Financial Policy</h3>
<p>Revising the New Budget Proposal, Raising Prices to Make Up for Shortfalls</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the cabinet meeting on the 3rd, new Finance Minister Yūki made a statement regarding the handling of the 12th fiscal year budget proposal and tax system reorganization plan: "The 12th fiscal year budget proposal amounts to a huge 3.04 billion yen, which has a considerable adverse impact on the economic world. I cannot help but change it, so I must revise it. However, it is not easy to technically revise it during the short adjournment period, so I intend to devote all my efforts to it. If there are technical difficulties, I intend to submit the budget proposal that was once withdrawn to the reconvened parliament as it is, and the government will express its intention to revise the budget proposal to parliament, and consult with parliament. After the budget is passed by parliament, I will adopt methods of reducing or saving budget expenditures to implement the budget. Parliament seems to intend to revise the budget proposal, and the ministers of each ministry also understand the revision in general terms. I also intend to revise the tax system reorganization plan, so I will submit the withdrawn bills separately if I believe there is no need to review them. As for the revenue shortfall caused by the budget, the shortfall will be temporarily covered by deficit bonds. After the budget is passed by parliament, I will strive to balance it by saving expenditures in the implementation of the budget. Due to a full understanding of the current situation, the national defense budget will not be revised in any way in general terms." (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Yūki Concurrently Serves as Colonial Affairs Minister</h3>
<p>Unrelated to the Issue of Abolishing the Ministry</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After completing the handover with former Colonial Affairs Minister Nagata at 3:00 PM on the 3rd, Yūki, who also serves as Colonial Affairs Minister, heard Nagata strongly assert that the Colonial Affairs Ministry is the general staff headquarters for the Japanese people's overseas development, especially for large-scale immigration to Manchuria, and that there is a practical need to expand the Colonial Affairs Ministry, believing that it should not be abolished. He requested the new Colonial Affairs Minister to consider it. Yūki said that the issue of the Finance Minister concurrently serving as Colonial Affairs Minister is due to the difficulty in selecting personnel and is unrelated to the issue of abolition. All issues will be handled properly after parliament closes. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Two Major National Policies</h3>
<p>Electricity and Steel, Striving to Realize Them</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hayashi cabinet's attitude towards the national electricity management plan has not been clearly expressed because a full-time Minister of Communications has not yet been decided. However, after the appointment ceremony on the 2nd, Yamazaki, who also serves as Minister of Communications, has stated that although no conclusion has been reached on the business form of state-owned or private-owned, he opposes maintaining the status quo and that there is a need for control. Therefore, even if the previous cabinet's electricity-related bills are submitted to parliament, they may be revised, but the principle of strengthening control, which is full of bills, will be followed in principle. Furthermore, Yamazaki, who also serves as Minister of Communications, has clearly indicated the direction of the national electricity policy, saying that although there is no need for consistent control of power generation, transmission, and distribution, there is no room for discussion on the control of power generation and transmission. On the one hand, private operators are not necessarily optimistic about the trend of the electricity plan. However, due to the in-depth public opposition movement of electrical companies and industries, they deeply hope that the new cabinet will make fundamental revisions based on this conviction, but they also admit that a considerable degree of control by the exercise of state power is inevitable. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] New Minister of Commerce Godo is the president of Showa Steel Works and has a deep understanding of steel policy. After Godo took office as Minister of Commerce, he expressed his intention to devote all his efforts to the steel issue, which has attracted attention from all quarters. The center-ism of the Nippon Steel Corporation by former Minister of Commerce Ogawa has broken down, and some people advocate re-examining the need for the national steel policy. Minister of Commerce Godo, in view of this, intends to first study the entity that is the center of the national steel policy, and examine the issue of revising the Steel Industry Promotion Law and other related issues. Furthermore, he will devote double the effort to the ongoing issue of unifying the pig iron sales organization. Not only in the need and supply issues, but also in technology and capital, he will strive for the satisfactory cooperation between Japan and Manchuria. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Reforming the Administrative Organization</h3>
<p>Starting by Expanding the Investigation Bureau, Ohashi Temporarily Serves as Director-General</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government decided at yesterday's cabinet meeting to dismiss Ishiwatari, the acting Director-General of the Cabinet Investigation Bureau, and appoint Chief Secretary Ohashi to concurrently serve in that position. Prime Minister Hayashi believes that the Investigation Bureau is an important organization for implementing national policies. In order to realize the reform of the administrative organization planned by the previous cabinet and to establish the General Affairs Agency, etc., he intends to expand the Investigation Bureau and implement reorganization and strengthen its functions as soon as possible. Therefore, he asked Retsu Kawata to take office as the Director-General of the Investigation Bureau when forming the cabinet, but Kawata declined to take office on the grounds that his health was not good enough. Temporarily, Ohashi was appointed to concurrently serve in that position, and the selection of a full-time Director-General is being carried out at the same time. (Domei, 3rd)</p>
<h3>American Workers Occupying Factory Ordered Illegal by Court</h3>
<p>Given 24 Hours to Leave; Auto Workers Prepare to Resist; Army Deployed as if Facing Major Enemy</p>
<p>Flint: Striking workers of the General Motors Corporation who have been occupying factory buildings have not yet withdrawn. The company authorities filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting the expulsion of these workers from the factory. After hearing the case, Judge Gadola has now ruled that the workers' occupation of the factory buildings is an illegal act, and the workers should leave the factory buildings within 24 hours. The picket lines formed by the workers should also be disbanded. At the same time, the state government has dispatched 1,200 troops to monitor the situation outside, preventing workers' families from providing food to the workers inside the factory. (February 2, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Flint: The General Motors Corporation requested the court to order the thousand striking workers remaining in the Fisher Body Plant to leave the plant. Today, Judge Gadola of the Circuit Court of Appeals granted the request. Immediately after the judgment was issued, the Genesee County authorities prepared to enforce it. First, County Executive Holger brought the judgment to the factory and read it to the workers. The workers listened silently and said they would discuss it with their leaders before deciding on a course of action. This morning, several units of the Michigan National Guard were deployed to the Chevrolet Plant No. 4, carrying tear gas and other weapons, and arrested six worker picketers, handing them over to the police. At the same time, it is reported that Lewis, the leader of the Industrial Organization Committee directing the strike, left Washington this afternoon, but it is unknown whether he will go to Detroit to confer with Michigan Governor Murphy or come here directly. (February 2, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] Officials here today have made no comment on the court's decision to evict the striking workers from the General Motors plant in Flint. Lewis, the leader of the Industrial Organization Committee, said before departing for Detroit, "The court will regret this decision." President Roosevelt also declined to comment when speaking to the press. However, it is known that Labor Secretary Perkins reported the latest situation in Flint to the President. Currently, the White House seems to be maintaining a hands-off approach. However, some believe that if Michigan Governor Murphy cannot find a way to bring labor and management together for a meeting, the President may have to intervene. As for Secretary Perkins' request to Congress for authorization for the government to subpoena witnesses in labor disputes, it is unlikely to pass due to opposition from a majority of lawmakers. (February 2, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<p>Flint: The company regards the 1,300 striking workers as already dismissed and their continued occupation of the factory as illegal. It claims that among the 135,000 unemployed workers, nearly 80 percent are willing to return to work. (February 3, Reuters via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Pacific Shipping to Resume Soon</h3>
<p>Tickets Now on Sale; Ships to Sail Tomorrow or the Day After</p>
<p>[San Francisco] The Pacific Coast maritime strike, which has lasted nearly 100 days, is now expected to end. This good news is a great relief at a time when the auto industry strike is surging. Shipping companies are now busy selling tickets and negotiating freight transport, as they expect to resume sailing on Friday or Saturday. The Maritime Workers' Union has ordered its members to vote on the settlement reached between labor and management. The results of the vote are expected to be announced tomorrow.

<p>[San Francisco] The Dollar Steamship Company notified the government today that it has resumed accepting Pacific mail. The mail ship President Hoover will set sail on Saturday. (February 2, Guomin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Seven-Nation Agreement on Tobacco Prohibition</h3>
<p>Effective This April</p>
<p>[Geneva] Great Britain, France, Japan, the Netherlands, India, Siam and other countries, signed the Opium Suppression Agreement in Bangkok, the capital of Siam, on November 27, 1931, stipulating that each signatory country should adopt a gradual approach to banning opium. This agreement had already been ratified by Great Britain, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, India, Siam and other countries. Japan did not ratify it until the 22nd of last month. The legal procedures have now been completed. This agreement will take effect from April 22 (three months after ratification by all signatory countries). (February 2, Havas News Agency)</p>
<h3>Sir Phipps Appointed British Ambassador to France</h3>
<p>[London] His Majesty the King has approved the transfer of Sir Eric Phipps, the current Ambassador to Germany, to be the Ambassador to France, succeeding Sir Clerk, who will retire in a few months. (February 2, Reuters via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Leader Plans Air Base in Philippine Territory</h3>
<p>Germany Still Recruiting Volunteers; Espionage Case Discovered in Barcelona</p>
<p>[Paris] Madame Tabouis, a diplomatic correspondent for the paper L'Oeuvre, recently stated that General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist Army, recently planned to build a large air base in the Spanish-controlled port of Ifni in Africa. It is said that the plan has been completed. This air base is not intended for German airships flying to South America, nor is it related to the Spanish Civil War. In fact, there is probably another plan. The plan is that General Franco is preparing to build several important air bases south of Agadir in French Morocco, that is, in the heart of French-controlled territory in North Africa, and the air base in Ifni is probably the first of these. In addition, the General Confederation of Labor's newspaper, Le Peuple, reported that Germany and Italy are still actively recruiting volunteers to serve in Spain for the Nationalist Army. "According to this, it is possible that volunteers from Germany and Italy will continue to leave for Spain in the coming days." (February 3, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Barcelona: Today, the Director of Military Supplies here announced that authorities discovered a major espionage case and subsequently detained many Italian nationals. It is reported that the case is currently under investigation. (February 2, Reuters via Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Germany Splits Transportation and Postal Services into Two Ministries</h3>
<p>Eltz von Rübenach Appointed Minister of Transport; Once Worked as Engineer on Jiaoji Railway</p>
<p>[Berlin] The government has ordered the dismissal of Transportation and Postal Minister Rubenaher, which has been approved. The ministry should be divided into two ministries, Transportation and Postal Services. Eltz von Rübenach, former president of the Deutsche Bank, will be the Minister of Transport, and Ohnesorge will be the Minister of Postal Services. Führer Hitler recently sent a letter to Rubenaher, expressing his gratitude for his various contributions during his four years in office. (February 2, Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The new Minister of Transport, Eltz von Rübenach, was originally the chief engineer of the Jiaoji Railway in China before the European War. He also presided over the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. After China joined the European War in 1917, he returned to Germany via Siberia. He later served as the General Manager of the Eisen Railway Company, Deputy Director of the German Railway Administration, and Director of the National Highway Administration.

<h3>Song Zheyuan's Mission in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Met Twice with Japanese Commander Tashiro; Economic Development Funds Still Nowhere to Be Found; Japanese Residents Building Large-Scale Gas Company</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Since Song Zheyuan came to Tianjin in mid-last month for diplomatic matters, he met with Japanese Commander Tashiro twice on the 26th and 27th of last month. There is still no prospect of progress on the general issues at hand. Among them, regarding Jia Deyao's succession as Chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Foreign Affairs Committee, the two sides initially had considerable disputes. The Japanese side even cited the Mei-He Agreement of the 24th year of the Republic as a pretext to interfere with the appointment of personnel by the authorities. The authorities have now stopped discussing this matter. Therefore, before the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee takes office, important negotiations can only be conducted by Song himself. However, due to the lack of room for maneuver, the Japanese side also finds it difficult to take advantage of the situation. This is the reason why there has been no change in Song's diplomacy since he resided in Tianjin. Regarding the issue of economic development, Song and Tashiro also considered it as the core of the negotiations when they met. Although their opinions tend to be consistent, they feel great difficulty when it comes to actual money. Li Sihao came to Tianjin on the 28th at Song's invitation and met with Sakatani, the Minister of Industry of the South Manchuria Railway stationed in Tianjin, and Ikeda, the third section chief of the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin, to discuss practical implementation methods. It is vaguely heard that funds cannot be raised for the Tanggu port construction. The joint venture between the Tianjin-Shijiazhuang Railway and the Longyan Iron Mine also suffers from the difficulty of obtaining large amounts of funds in the short term. The Hebei-Chahar authorities estimate that the revival of the Longyan Iron Mine development issue requires a minimum of 14 million yuan. They advocate that the Japanese side can be in a lending position, and China can handle it independently. The Japanese side has the right to purchase steel and iron with priority. There is no need to change it to a Sino-Japanese joint venture. This is because the old shareholders of the mine cannot be cleared, and the foreign debts owed are also difficult to repay in total. If 14 million yuan is raised, it can only be used for repairing mine machinery, purchasing Tangshan steelmaking furnaces, and preparing for resumption of work. It is impossible to clear old debts and return old shares with this amount. The Japanese side does not quite agree, feeling that doing so does not fully meet its purpose of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Li Sihao negotiated in Tianjin for several days and returned to Beiping on the evening of the 31st. He may still come to Tianjin in the short term to renegotiate. As for Song Zheyuan, he still has about two weeks to stay, and he will be able to return to Beiping after spending the Spring Festival. Before leaving Tianjin, he will still inevitably contact the Japanese side on such matters.</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese residents in Tianjin have initiated the construction of a "Tianjin Gas Industry Co., Ltd." in Tianjin. It is hosted by the Japanese Residents' Association. On the 31st, it specially convened a founders' meeting at the Japanese Club, and recommended five Japanese residents, including Akayama and Konchou, as preparatory members. It is stipulated that the construction should be completed within six months, with a capital of 2 million yuan. First, 1.2 million yuan is raised, set as 40,000 shares, each share is 50 yuan. Construction will begin when one-fourth of the shares are fully collected. The company site is located southwest of the Japanese Cemetery in Haiguang Temple in the Japanese Concession. It is divided into three phases of expansion. The first phase is exclusively for the burning of Japanese households in the Japanese Concession, with a supply of 48,000 cubic feet. The second phase will expand to the British and French Concessions, and the third phase will spread to the entire city. The average family of four or five people will charge about 3.4 yuan per month. According to the calculation of 1,800 households in the Japanese Concession, the monthly fee can be 543,600 yuan, and the annual amount can be 6,523,200 yuan. It has now been submitted to the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin for record. The construction is expected to begin in early March. There is also a Daqing Chemical Plant on the opposite side of Nankai Six Mile Taiwan Japanese-Chinese Middle School, which also specializes in the production of toxic gas. In the future, when the new gas company is established, it will be merged into one. Whether the inside story of this construction is only for the burning of ordinary households, no one dares to believe it. (1st)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Business Community Organizes Tax System Research Committee</h3>
<p>Collecting Opinions from Various Businesses on the Taxable Standard of Business Tax for Research</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The new business tax taxable standard in Guangdong Province is to levy taxes based on turnover, and merchants are vowing to fight to the death. At present, officials and businessmen are still going to extremes. The Department of Finance believes that this case is implemented by the order of the superior, and it is not convenient to change it suddenly. Before the merchants withdraw the new tax rate, they are still mostly waiting to see the declared tax amount. A few days ago, Director Zheng of the Municipal Business Tax Bureau once summoned representatives of various businesses to the bureau to explain the business tax issue, but the representatives of various businesses still insisted on changing the taxable standard. In recent days, chambers of commerce from various counties have been responding with telegrams. In this case, the Guangdong Province business tax issue is not easy to resolve in a short period of time. The Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce convened another meeting of representatives of various businesses on the 1st of this month to discuss everything, and resolved to organize the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce Tax System Research Committee. The 22 executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce are natural committee members, and 19 representatives of various businesses are recommended as committee members to be established on a scheduled basis.

The organizational content of the Tax System Research Committee is recorded as follows: ㊀ Name, named the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce Tax System Research Committee, attached to the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce. ㊁ Purpose, this meeting is closely related to the business community because the government has now issued new chapters of business tax and implemented the income tax method. In order to promote the benefits as much as possible, the opinions of various businesses are collected and dedicated to the government to collect the benefits of wide thinking. In addition to the above two tax systems, those related to the new tax system and the business community can study it. ㊂ The committee members are all the executive and supervisory committee members of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as natural committee members, and five people are recommended by the committee members' talks as committee members, and then nine people are recommended from the committee members as standing committee members to handle daily affairs. Each committee member is famous and has a job. ㊃ Staff, this meeting may employ cadres due to the needs of affairs, abide by the committee's intentions, and handle meeting affairs. The number of staff and salaries shall be determined by the committee, and the required funds shall be submitted to the general meeting for retroactive recognition in the future. ㊄ Meetings, the committee of this meeting shall hold a meeting once a month, and the current affairs committee shall hold a meeting once a month. In case of important matters, they shall be convened by letter at any time. ㊅ Work, the research results of this meeting shall be submitted to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee for resolution, and reported to the members' talks. External documents shall be carried out in the name of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. ㊆ Deadline, the tasks of this meeting, such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee resolution, are deemed unnecessary to continue to establish, submit to the members' talks for reporting, that is, end. ㊇ Detailed rules, the detailed rules for this meeting shall be determined separately. ㊈ Supplementary rules, this meeting shall be established on a scheduled day after the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Executive Committee resolution and the members' talks pass.

<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Police Extorted Large Sums of Money</p>
<p>Cao Binwen, a clerk from the Zhoupu Township Office in the fifth district, along with bailiffs Shi Yanhong and others, holding a transfer order from the county government, went to Sujiaqiao in the west of the town. Under the pretext of secretly investigating private opium use, they threatened and extorted money from the wealthy Zhu Jintang's family. Zhu's nephew, Bofan, came out to explain to them that his uncle was in Shanghai and would talk later. However, Cao and others forcibly wanted Bofan to go to the county. Bofan was terrified and invited Baozhang Lu Zhiren and Jiazhang Zhang Songfu to negotiate with them. Cao and others claimed that they would not handle it without a reward of 600 yuan. Lu Zhang was very suspicious, thinking that the county government should not act in this way when conducting a secret investigation, but the instructions they held seemed to be genuine, so they did not dare to object and allowed the extortion. As a result, Zhu handed Cao and others 300 yuan. The next day, Zhu's nephew went to Shanghai and told Jintang about the matter. Jintang was furious when he heard about it, saying that he held a smoker's license from the Shanghai Special Municipality, so how could he be accused of private opium use and extorted a large sum of money? He immediately returned to his hometown and secretly reported to the district office, requesting a thorough investigation. That night, the district office sent a letter to the public security police station to arrest Cao. He was escorted to the county yesterday for verification.</p>

After repeated interrogations by the county, it was confirmed that he was involved in drug trafficking, and he was sentenced to death according to law. As soon as the judgment is drafted, it will be submitted to the district commissioner for review.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Banning Extortion Under the Guise of Birthday Celebrations</p>
<p>The Zhenjiang County Government has now heard that the chief of Baojia in various districts and townships often posts posts on the grounds of the birth of a young child or the birthday of his wife. This move is close to extortion and is very inappropriate. Moreover, the chief of Baojia in townships and townships serves the locality, and should especially value reality and dismiss Huahua, and set an example by himself, and should not use useful money for unnecessary consumption. It has recently issued a notice to all districts to earnestly ban this. After this warning, if the aforementioned situation occurs again, it will be immediately transferred to the case for handling according to law.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Repercussions of Pottery Control</p>
<p>Residents in the Ganlou area of Jiaxing have lived on pottery for generations, inheriting their clothes and bowls from each other. Recently, the county issued a plan to revive the pottery industry, and is preparing to implement control. In general, pottery merchants are panicked. The transportation and sales of pottery are complex, and they are deeply afraid that a single mistake will put the pottery merchants to death. According to local pottery people, the number of pottery produced in the Ganlou area is scattered, and the categories are as many as a hundred or more. Therefore, the sale and purchase are very trivial, and the market is different in the morning and evening. If the same price is forced, the capital will be greatly affected if it is too small, and the transportation and sales will be stagnant if it is too large. Moreover, the places where they are sold are towns such as Wuzhen Changxing, and the wharves are scattered. If the sale and purchase are entrusted to brokers, it is tantamount to creating an exploitation class. If agencies are set up in each port, the personnel will be frequent, which will only increase the burden on merchants. In summary, it is of great importance to pottery merchants, so they have applied to the county government to withdraw the decree, and in addition to the third-grade bricks, they still ask to give merchants freedom of trade.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Four Accumulated Bandits Executed</p>

On the morning of the 1st, they were executed by shooting.</p>

<h3>Huang Bochang to Fight Haben Xin Again</h3>
<p>▲Scheduled for 8:30 PM on the 8th ▲Held at the Tianchan Stage</p>
<p>Huang Bochang, an overseas Chinese wrestler from the United States, has repeatedly defeated Filipino and Indian experts since returning to China last year. Another Indian, Haben Xin, challenged him. The two fought last month at the Vienna Ballroom, but the match was evenly matched and there was no clear winner. Recently, Mr. Huang admitted that not defeating Haben Xin was a regret, so he challenged the Indian Leopard again. After much negotiation, an agreement was finally reached. Because Mr. Huang only fought six rounds last time, which did not resolve the outcome, he proposed extending the match to eight rounds for a grand battle. Haben Xin, however, believed that Mr. Huang had sufficient strength, so he only wanted to fight six rounds first. After friendly mediation, it was decided to fight seven rounds, each round lasting ten minutes, scheduled for 8:30 PM on the 8th of this month at the Tianchan Stage. In addition to this major battle, there will also be a match between Filipino Aquinaldo and Indian Miha, for a total of three rounds. Aquinaldo is the current Filipino heavyweight wrestling champion, while Miha is strong and powerful, and also a famous Indian wrestler. There will also be three boxing matches. This event is organized by Mr. Huang himself. (Previous events were hosted by Shanxi Overseas Chinese.) In order to popularize wrestling matches, ticket prices are lower than before, with five types: 60 cents, one yuan, two yuan, three yuan, and four yuan, to facilitate attendance by students from various schools. Reserved seating can be purchased in advance at the Motieli Piano Store on Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>American All-Star Basketball Team Arrives in Shanghai Tomorrow, Shanghai Mixed Team Practices Tonight</h3>
<p>Li Zhenzhong and Yin Hongxiang Rush to Help</p>
<p>The Sino-Western mixed team organized by this city to compete against the American All-Star basketball team has already selected its players the day before yesterday. However, among the ten selected players, there are only two guards. In order to increase the team's strength, a long-distance telegram was sent to Nanjing to add Yin Hongxiang, making a total of eleven players. The team is scheduled to practice at Shenyuan at 7:30 PM today. A total of 1,500 tickets are available, priced at one and a half yuan each, and will be sold today at the Physical Education Association, the Dalu Newspaper Office, and the Huadong Sports Equipment Company. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Practice Tonight</p>
<p>The Sino-Western mixed team of this city is scheduled to hold a practice session at the Shenyuan basketball court at 7:30 PM tonight. All eleven selected players, Carson, Sguia, Rankin, Locke, Cadden, Feng Nianhua, Zhang Liangxiong, Li Zude, Wu Bixian, Li Zhenzhong, and Yin Hongxiang, are required to attend. Li and Yin will leave Beijing this morning to participate in Shanghai. According to the above list, in addition to guards Carson, Yin Hongxiang, and Zhang Liangxiong, and center Li Zhenzhong, Locke (Locke may also play forward), the rest are all forwards.</p>
<p>American All-Stars</p>
<p>As for the American All-Star team members, they are not only American college basketball stars, but also famous athletes. For example, Cobb was once seen as the most promising to break the world record in the high hurdles. In 1932, he set a world intercollegiate high hurdles record of 14.7 seconds in Oklahoma City, and in 1935, he set a university high hurdles record of 14.5 seconds representing the University of Southern California, and once equaled the world record. Captain "Baby Face" Browning has served as captain of the University of Southern California basketball team three times. Bill, Musk, and Howard (6 feet 4 inches tall, known as "Big Kid," who scores every time under the basket) are his classmates. Mackton and Vedesca graduated from Los Angeles Institute. Tang Qimeng was formerly a strongman at Wovhaiwo.</p>
<p>Record in the Philippines</p>
<p>The American team won seven out of eight games in the Philippines. In their second game, they lost by one point to the former All-Philippine champion Saint Peter's team. The Saint team repeatedly used long shots from extremely difficult angles and unexpectedly succeeded. After suffering this defeat, the American team did not dare to underestimate their opponents and successively overcame the current All-Philippine champions and runners-up, Saint Mesmos, etc., greatly enhancing their reputation. The Philippine team, after obtaining fifth place in the Berlin World Basketball Championship, has already taken the lead in the Far East, but the American team's skills are actually above the Philippine team. The American team is good at using a "slow motion" style, cooperating into a mechanized team, often avoiding dribbling and running, which surprised the Philippine team.</p>

<h3>Mr. Jiang Junhui of Our Resident Student Supervision Office in Japan Returns to Report</h3>
<p>Reported to the Ministry of Education in Beijing Yesterday on Studying in Japan</p>
<p>Jiang Junhui, Chief of General Affairs of our country's Resident Student Supervision Office in Japan, returned to China from Japan the day before yesterday, and went to Beijing yesterday to report to the authorities of the Ministry of Education on studying in Japan. The reporter interviewed Mr. Jiang at his residence yesterday, and according to the published talks as follows: ㊀ The number of students studying in Japan was close to 10,000 at its peak in the past year, but there were uneven qualities among them. Since Supervisor Chen took office, he adopted a policy of emphasizing quality over quantity. (If all were excellent members, quality and quantity would be equally important. With the surge in Japanese gold, international changes, and various other relationships, the current number of students in Japan is no more than half of the peak. Although these students may not all be excellent in terms of academics and character, they can generally maintain self-respect, work hard, and not forget their purpose of studying abroad. Recently, there has been a new trend, that is, Supervisor Chen's policy of emphasizing quality over quantity, after many compromises, except for one or two commercialized schools, which are only thinking about their own interests and are still outwardly compliant but inwardly opposed, the majority of schools have been able to understand and are willing to cooperate. According to the authorities of a certain school, the position of the Supervision Office is as a guest, and the position of the school is as the host. The guest should not overstep the host. Now that the guest is not afraid of hard work and is responsible for rectification, the host should abandon the attitude of bystanders and give as much assistance as possible. The school has this kind of expression, and the cultural and educational administrative authorities also have this kind of argument. Therefore, I believe that the future of the academic circles studying in Japan is very hopeful. In the future, there will be batches of students studying in Japan with excellent character and academics returning to the motherland to serve.</p>
<p>㊁ The problem of the way out for students after graduation is originally closely related to their personal strength. On the one hand, Supervisor Chen pays attention to the cultivation of students' strength, so that they have the ability to deal with things calmly when serving. On the other hand, he also pays attention to establishing contact with all walks of life and supplying talents as much as possible. Recently, Fujian has been seeking veterinarians, and Guangxi has been seeking dental graduates, wanting the Supervision Office to recommend them from students studying in Japan, and there are still suitable people who can be introduced.</p>
<p>㊂ Japanese police were originally world-renowned, but there are only two police schools. One of them does not accept our students. The one that accepts our students is called the Police Training Institute. Although the name of this school is not as beautiful as a specialized university, the teaching and management equipment are very complete. The admission qualifications stipulate that only police officers above the rank of incumbent police officer are accepted, which is like a military officer university. For some reason, it is planned not to accept our students this year. The Supervision Office is currently negotiating, requesting continued acceptance, but it is unknown whether the goal can be achieved. It is heard that recently, there are quite a few people who want to enter the school and go to the East. It is hoped that before the Supervision Office's negotiations have been completed, do not go abroad rashly, and those who have not served as police officers should not have this ambition.</p>
<p>㊃ When the Xi'an Incident occurred, many students studying abroad were panicked, and they went to the embassy and the Supervision Office to inquire. Their sad and resolute attitude fully demonstrated their deep love for the country and their eagerness to serve the country, which is really worthy of joy and attention.</p>
<p>㊄ Since the Xi'an Incident occurred, students in the disaster area and its vicinity, regardless of whether they are publicly or privately funded, have been cut off from economic assistance, and their lives are in a state of extreme anxiety. The current Supervision Office is in the process of requesting assistance from the Central Government, and Ambassador Xu has always been benevolent and caring, and sees people starving and drowning as if he himself were starving and drowning, and is also trying to find ways to hope that the country will pay special attention to these intellectuals, because once they lose their studies and drift to foreign countries, it is a loss to the country, not just the misfortune of a few of them.</p>
<p>㊅ The problem of the graduation qualification certificate for students who have not received a study abroad certificate is originally of vital interest to the students. They are bound to fight for it. The Supervision Office has repeatedly asked the upper authorities to allow leniency, but the outcome is unknown. The students now trust the Supervision Office to seek benefits for them.</p>
<p>㊆ What the Supervision Office feels most difficult is the issue of funding. Because of this relationship, various planned tasks are still difficult to fully implement. The original funding is really too small, so even the section chiefs and above have to donate their salaries to cover relocation expenses. Usually, in order to facilitate the smooth progress of work, there are many external socializing, and all expenses cannot be handled without additional salary. It is hoped that the budget can be increased in the future. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>General Membership Registration of the Chinese Law Society</h3>

<h3>Chinese Vocational Education Society Holds Expert Conference</h3>

<h3>Ministry of Judicial Administration Rectifies Prison Moral Education</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that the implementation of rehabilitation in prisons places the primary importance on moral education. However, moral education teachers are often appointed indiscriminately and fail to fulfill their duties. In order to rectify prison moral education, the Ministry has specifically amended Article 4 of the Provisional Standards for the Appointment of Prison Officials and Article 1 of the Provisional Rules for the Treatment and Allowances of Appointed Prison Staff, strictly stipulating the qualifications of moral education teachers, in order to ensure that these personnel are able to use their knowledge effectively. Subsequently, new prison teachers will be directly appointed by the Ministry, and a general order was issued to all local courts yesterday to comply.</p>
<h3>Guangxia Middle School Hires Teachers and Staff</h3>

It is reported that the two parts of the school, middle and elementary, started on the 1st of this month, elementary school started classes on the 3rd, and middle school started classes on the 8th. There are not many vacancies in each grade, and registration must be done quickly.</p>
<h3>New Regulations at Xinmin Middle School</h3>
<p>Xinmin Middle School in Jiangwan Beizha, this city, has long been praised by people in society for its serious teaching and management. Yesterday, a school affairs meeting was held to discuss the school's renovation plan for this semester. It is planned to further improve the students' level and teaching equipment. It was decided to allocate a large sum of money within the regular expenses to purchase a large number of books, instruments, and general equipment. The number of students in each grade will also be expanded as much as possible. In terms of physical education, the school will add extracurricular exercise time in accordance with the Ministry of Education's orders. This semester is the 10th anniversary of the school, and the preparatory committee has already been established to prepare for the achievement exhibition and the compilation of the commemorative publication.</p>
<h3>Several Secondary Education Issues Related to English Teaching (6)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shijie</p>
<p>Also quite pressing, this situation is quite common. We cannot completely or mostly blame the students for not working hard. Maybe they are not working hard in the right way, the guiding teachers are not good, or maybe the teaching materials and teaching methods are not suitable. The current English curriculum is part of the secondary school curriculum and has been revised several times. Now, the teaching materials and teaching methods of various schools are generally based on this curriculum standard. If we want to remedy the current situation, it seems that we should seek a fundamental improvement in both teaching materials, teaching methods, and teachers. Only then can the English teaching of secondary schools have a solid foundation. This issue contains many specialized problems, especially the research results in linguistics in recent years, which should be cited to some extent on this issue, so that we can obtain scientific principles on this issue, and then propose a specific plan for reform based on these principles. These all require detailed research by experts, scholars, and teachers to determine. For individual issues such as English teaching materials, teaching methods, and teachers, we need to find solutions based on academic principles. For the entire issue that goes beyond each issue and includes each issue, we need a constructive idea and attitude. Regarding the direction that the study of this issue will take in the future, I personally have a little hope, and I believe that there are definitely many people who express the same feeling about this point of hope. This point of hope is that the improvement of English teaching in secondary schools must conform to the general principles and goals of secondary education. If the above-mentioned principles of secondary education can be established, English teaching in secondary schools should reach the following limits: ㊀ Should be practical. Obviously, for example, if the teaching materials adopt foreign things, it is better to adopt Chinese things for practicality. The teaching method should also conform to the situation of Chinese students. ㊁ Should be rich in cultivating students' ability to study on their own and to conduct research automatically. This is especially necessary to bring up in English teaching because to have this ability, one must learn English to a minimum level in the secondary school era. ㊂ Should take into account the needs of students to continue their studies, and should also take into account the needs of students to enter the society to serve after graduation. On the one hand, enable students who continue their studies to study advanced knowledge, and on the other hand, cultivate a solid foundation for students who enter the society to serve in various businesses as junior cadres. Today, all the gentlemen who attended the conference and the gentlemen of the Chinese Western Language Society must be particularly concerned about this issue and will have many contributions. The work of the Chinese Western Language Society and today's conference has aroused interest and attention from all parties, so I would like to take this opportunity to raise a few points for everyone to consider and wish the conference and the Chinese Western Language Society a successful future.

<p>Millers Engage in Covering, Recent Flour Prices Rise Seven Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market opened in the morning with prices showing initial stability, followed by a surge in all months. Chicago and Canada's wheat quotations both rose by about thirty to forty cents, while Liverpool fell by one penny. After the opening, wheat quotations varied by five points, and market sentiment was still undecided, only one cent higher than the previous day. However, after the second session, the market gradually rose. This month, due to millers covering and slightly active customer demand, buying activity increased directly. Outside investors continued to absorb March and April contracts, which also became more expensive. In the afternoon session, market sentiment for February, March, and April became increasingly strong. Although this month is not a delivery period, the exchange has closed accounts on the 5th. During this period, each factory's spot goods should be based on the standard market price. Therefore, mills are engaging in covering and have a relationship with spot goods. Because March is close to this month, it also rose sharply by 7.5 cents. Market sentiment for April and July was more stable, rising only three to four cents.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Driven Up by Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures opened in the morning with prices initially flat, followed by gains. Because wheat quotations fluctuated, the initial market was similar to the previous day. June and July contracts were slightly lower by one cent. Then, as the flour market rebounded, buying activity also increased, and prices rose by three to four cents at the close. In the afternoon session, trading was not active, but the flour market's unexpected rise inevitably drove the sentiment of inside and outside investors, so bids for all months rose by another three to five cents. However, market insiders speculate that with the closing of accounts approaching, the exchange only has one day of trading left. If there is no practical sales strategy after the Spring Festival, the market may not be able to stand firm. Spot goods have not been delivered because factory demand has stopped.</p>
<p>River Rice Sales in This Area Slightly Brisk</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs were the same as before, totaling more than 40, with about 8,000 dan of goods. Of these, thin rice accounted for more than 20. Sales in this area were slightly more active than before. The Qingdao and Yantai gangs bought more than 3,000 packages of thin rice, but buying was not loose, so the market situation was stable. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice were all unchanged. Yin Bian Yuan and Lu Jian were both flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 21 or 22 ships arrived from various ports down the river. Various transactions in the market were still flat. The price of high-grade white japonica rice was stable, while that of medium and low grades tightened by several points. The price of early thin rice was firm, white Yuan was firm, Yin Yuan was stable, and other goods were largely unchanged.</p>
<p>Indica Rice Buyers Have Mostly Stopped</p>
<p>Yesterday, customers arrived and continued to load from various ports along the Yangtze River. Most merchants have already folded their samples, and most have already rested. The Guangdong gang has yet to clear the shipments it was handling before, and it is feared that there will be no more handling this year. Shantou, Xiamen, and Beiyang gangs have also mostly stopped. Yesterday, only this area handled 2,273 packages of Jiangxi rice and 250 packages of Wenzhou indica rice. Other inquiries were few. Although customers have not released samples, with both inventory and arrivals full, the market has turned flat and soft.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Overproduction Makes This Month's Yarn Decline Formidable</p>
<p>The yarn market fell sharply in the morning but turned stable in the afternoon. However, due to the approaching period for closing final accounts, customers have announced that they have stopped buying, so yarn merchants are uniformly bearish. Because yarn mills have accumulated yarn, the delivery of February contracts will be robust. Selling pressure is also heavy when prices rise. Although many parties have released yarn, most have not yet unloaded it. The turbulence ahead is still brewing.</p>
<p>Geng Feng Sells in the Morning, Buys in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The yarn market opened lower across the board in the morning. The recent decline has been severe. Market rumors said that a large batch of spot yarn could be delivered. Secondly, some bulls have already unloaded, so the trading floor is slack, and prices are falling step by step. Geng Feng also sold a huge amount, but Mr. Xu has recently been buying, in a very large quantity. Indian merchants are still in a bullish position. As a result, all months fell by 1.578 yuan to 2.8 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The market was particularly weak in the afternoon, especially for the current month. However, long-term contracts were still good. The current month was still flat in the second session, and the forward months rose by another two to three cents. By the third session, Jin Chang suddenly bought 1,600 bales of February contracts, rising by seven cents, and other months improved. At the close, February rose another three cents, and the forward months improved. Geng Feng and Jin Chang sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. It was found that Yu Da sold 2,550 bales, Heng Yi 800 bales, He Xing 600 bales, Geng Feng 2,450 bales, Chang Ji 1,200 bales, Yuan Yi 2,100 bales, Sen Kang 850 bales, Feng Tai 800 bales, and Da Chang Cheng 600 bales. Jin Chang bought 1,250 bales, Ji Feng 700 bales, Da Fu 700 bales, Tong Fu 900 bales, Xing Chang 950 bales, Yi Chang 1,250 bales, Tai Chang 1,200 bales, Yong Da 1,100 bales, Tong He 1,050 bales, and Chang Feng 1,250 bales, Xie Cheng 550 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Less Than 500 Bales</p>
<p>The spot yarn market was unusually quiet. It was found that all gangs bought only 434 bales throughout the day, and the selling price fell by one yuan. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Prices Unchanged Recently</p>
<p>Buying and selling seem to be ending.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell and then rose, and the market remained in a fluctuating state. Because most operators are in the process of closing accounts, there are very few transactions. The spot cotton business has become quiet. Factories have stopped operating, and sources from various routes are increasingly scarce, because inland cotton firms have successively stopped weighing and closing accounts.</p>
<p>Both Bulls and Bears Lack Interest</p>
<p>The cotton market opened weaker in the morning, and the market remained dull. Overseas cotton markets were mediocre, but trading in the exchange was very scarce. Both bulls and bears have no interest in predicting the trend, and the market remains in a fluctuating situation. As a result, all months fell by 0.5 to 1.2 cents compared to the previous day's close. The market was calm in the afternoon, with nothing exciting to say. After the first session, retail short covering increased, and the market gradually rebounded. As a result, all months rose by 0.5 to 1.2 cents. It was found that Da Feng sold 1,900 dan, Ming De 1,000 dan, Yuan Yi 1,100 dan, Chang Feng 5,300 dan, and Yong Yu 1,200 dan. He Xing bought 2,700 dan, Sheng Yuan 1,100 dan, Yi Kang 2,000 dan, and Run Kang 1,400 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices of the day are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sources Scarce</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption is sluggish, factory demand is closed, and sources are scarce: 100 bales of Yao cotton and 96 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>American Cotton Sellers Are Advantageous</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened weak, and prices fell by one to five points for each month. Initially, due to the fall in various commodity prices, bulls at home and abroad closed their positions. At the same time, the car strike has not been resolved, and the flood situation has shown signs of easing. Sellers were advantageous in the market. It was reported that the water level of the Mississippi River stopped rising, and the water level of the Ohio River suddenly dropped. As a result, those who bought in because of flood news are now selling. However, when the May contract reached 12.5 cents, brokers bought. Before the close, news of the successful car strike strengthened the market again. Spot goods fell by four points, and futures fell by four to eight points. British spot cotton fell by eight points, and futures fell by six or seven points. The large positions closed by old Indian cotton bulls were absorbed by brokers. Favorable Japanese transportation costs and reduced arrivals of Omlas led to short covering in the February contract. Later, trading was sparse, and the market was calm. Ping Guo Er fell by 1.25 rupees, Omla fell by 1.25 to 2 rupees, and Bai Luo Xi fell by 1.75 to 2 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (2nd).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the forecast for the opening on the 3rd is: Bai Luo Xi at 227 rupees, Omla at 209.5 rupees, up 0.25 rupees, and Ping Guo Er at 183 rupees, up 0.5 rupees.</p>
<p>Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth All Fall</p>
<p>A telegram from Osaka on the 3rd: spot yarn fell by 2 to 6 yuan. 16-count fan surface at 250 yuan, down 2 yuan. 20-count goldfish at 269 yuan, down 6 yuan. 40-count five-star at 420 yuan, unchanged. 42-count pheasant at 403 yuan, down 4 yuan. Futures yarn fell by 5 cents to 2 yuan. The near month was 259 yuan, and the far month was 256.5 yuan. Futures cotton fell by 0.3 to 0.55 yuan. The near month was 75.2 yuan, and the far month was 77.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods Have the Most Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market remained firm. Although the yarn market suffered setbacks, thread prices remained firm. Spot sales of cotton cloth to this area and the Tianjin gang were still enthusiastic, with Eastern goods being more popular. The Tianjin gang successively transacted over 100 cases of Nei Wai factory Si Jun Zi broadcloth, and over 400 packages of Qingdao goods fine cloth and Gongda factory blue double fish fine twill. This area also stockpiled several hundred packages of Yu Feng Da Kang and other factory fine cloth. There was very little inventory on the market. The sales price fell slightly by 2.5 cents per piece due to the empty sellers dumping on the yarn decline. Secondly, the Shandong gang also absorbed 30 cases of Si Jun Zi broadcloth. The Ningbo gang imported over 100 packages of rough cloth from Yi He, Bao Xing, Zhen Tai, and other factories. Over 40 cases of poplin, foreign yarn, corduroy, white velvet, thread velvet, and printed cloth were also imported. The Hunan and Guangdong gangs continued to add a total of over 200 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, poplin, and rough cloth from this factory. The other nearby customer gangs were very quiet. The market was very firm. Heavy rough cloth rose in price as factory prices increased. Zhen Tai, Bao Xing, Shen Xin, Geng Yu and other factory products all rose by 5 cents (per piece).</p>
<p>British Pullover Woolens Continue to Arrive</p>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen market was quiet. Spot goods and orders were both quiet. Merchants are all taking stock and settling accounts in preparation for the final closing. New woolen goods continue to arrive at the port. Most of them are British pullover woolens, most of which are designated by dismantling gangs. It is reported that more will continue to arrive in the middle of next week.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Rise Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, public bonds on the Chinese Stock Exchange rose sharply. Because market sentiment recovered and became firm, large investors bought heavily, and retail investors also bought a lot. The market was tight, and prices gradually advanced, which was very energetic. However, because there will be a longer holiday after the next two days of trading, bulls and bears gradually became busy closing their positions. It is feared that under the booming atmosphere, there will be continued changes. Fuxing public bonds have not been traded for two weeks. Now that buyers have appeared, the price is 77 yuan, which is a sharp rise of 4 yuan compared to before. Yesterday morning, the opening price for No. 50 was suddenly purchased in large quantities, market sentiment turned bullish, and prices rose uniformly by five cents to four dimes. Nos. 32 and 47 were sold a lot. The trend continued to rise in the next session. No. 50 was very strong, and Nos. 6 and 35 also bought a lot. Nos. 43 and 31 continued to sell a lot.

The closing price was flat and firm due to the competition between bulls and bears. Nos. 32 and 43 were still selling, while Nos. 11 and 10 were buying. The price only rose or fell by a dime. As a result of the whole day, all rose by 1.5 dimes to 6.5 dimes. The total turnover was 7,755,000 yuan. The comparison of its gains, losses, highs, and lows is listed in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>

There were few continued openings for Hao goods. However, it was heard from Shantou that the upstream lifting of green prices was turning to fall by several corners due to high prices and market stagnation.

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>The Problem of Dry Cocoon Exports</h3>
<p>— Qian Tianda</p>
<p>In recent years, the world economy has gradually recovered, prices have risen, and raw silk prices in Japan and the United States have soared. Our country's silk industry, which was gradually declining, has received this life-sustaining elixir, and it also shows a thriving trend. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the national raw silk exports totaled 97,238 bales, more than double the 32,977 bales in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. If it were not for the lack of raw materials, the export volume would have been even more considerable. In the 25th year of the Republic of China, the export of raw silk from Shanghai was 41,446 bales, which was an increase compared with the 23rd year of the Republic of China, but a decrease compared with the 24th year of the Republic of China. The biggest reason is only affected by the weather, the spring and autumn silkworm farming is not good, the raw materials are insufficient, and the price of dry cocoons is high. Silk factories do not count the cost, which leads to high silk prices abroad, and our country has no goods to respond to. A great opportunity has been missed, which is regrettable.</p>
<p>At a time when raw materials are scarce, there are also unscrupulous silk cocoon merchants who have successively loaded and exported large quantities of dry cocoons, resulting in a thin inventory. Silk factories with short capital have been forced to shut down, and tens of millions of workers have suddenly become unemployed. The impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is huge. Reading Mr. Jin Sheng's "View on Dry Cocoon Export" published in the special column of Shen Bao on January 28 is tantamount to defending those who export dry cocoons. The author believes that the impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is huge, confusing right and wrong, like a bone stuck in the throat, and cannot help but speak out. I dare to raise a few points and discuss them with domestic sericulture experts:</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Sheng said: "As far as the author knows, the reason why silk factories in this city are forced to stop production is not because raw materials are exhausted, but because the cocoon price is not suitable. At present, there are still more than 10,000 dan of dry cocoons piled up in the warehouses of this city and Wuxi." Anyone who knows a little about economic principles will know that this statement is unreasonable. We know that market transactions cannot go beyond the scope of the law of supply and demand, but the purpose of dry cocoon merchants and silk merchants is to make profits. At the same time, silk factories must consider costs when purchasing dry cocoons. If the cocoon price exceeds the silk price, a deal will definitely not be reached. Therefore, if the number of dry cocoons is small and the price is expensive, silk manufacturers can still make a small profit. If the price of dry cocoons exceeds the price of raw silk (the cocoon price is not suitable), it is really unreasonable. As for the dry cocoons that are currently on the market for sale, there are less than 5,000 dan in Shanghai and Wuxi. This is the actual situation and cannot be fabricated. Even if it is calculated as 10,000 dan, there are about 60 silk factories that have started operations in Shanghai this year, with an average of 200 silk reeling machines per factory. Each machine consumes 5 jin of cocoons per day (assuming that each machine produces 16 liang of silk per day, and the dry cocoons are discounted by 500 jin of market weight, and 1 dan of silk is reeled). Then 10,000 dan of dry cocoons is not enough for Shanghai silk factories to use for one month. However, new cocoons will be available in mid-May, so the lack of raw materials is really a fatal blow to the silk industry. How can it be more than 10,000 dan?</p>
<p>Dry cocoon exports affect the silk industry, which is needless to say. Let us try to think from the perspective of the entire country and nation. The nature of raw silk exports and dry cocoon exports is also obviously different. Dry cocoons are agricultural products, while raw silk is a semi-finished product. The biggest reason for the adverse international trade in our country over the years is that most of the exports are raw materials, while most of the imports are manufactured products. The exchange of raw materials and manufactured products is unequal. If raw silk is exported, all the wages and expenses during manufacturing are paid by foreigners. The Chinese people have more income, which also increases their financial resources. The export of dry cocoons is not the same. We will not discuss what foreign countries will use after purchasing them. In our country, it is a reduction in manufacturing raw materials, and at the same time, it reflects an increase in the unemployment of workers (as for the overproduction of dry cocoons, which exceeds the needs of the country, it should be discussed separately). Especially at a time when raw materials are scarce and the number of unemployed workers is increasing in the domestic silk industry, we certainly do not agree with the shipment and export of large quantities of dry cocoons.</p>
<p>"The government should use the international market to stipulate the domestic cocoon price and silk price, and should not use the market price of the Japanese and American stock exchanges as a standard, because the mother burden was raised by 50 or 60 yuan in both spring and autumn last year." The largest silk markets abroad are Yokohama and Kobe in Japan, New York in the United States, and Lyon in France. There are no other important international raw silk markets besides these. I don't know what the so-called international market is based on. As far as I know, the cocoon price set in the spring and autumn last year was appropriate, and there was no huge difference of 50 or 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Jin Sheng believes that the only reason for the export of dry cocoons is that our country's silk factories have outdated machinery and are not suitable for reeling high-grade raw silk. In fact, in recent years, our country's silk reeling machinery has been greatly improved. Factories in Wuxi such as Yongtai, Huaxin, Jiangchang, Yongsheng, Dingchang, and Dacheng have all been completely improved (Mr. Jin Sheng has already mentioned the factories in Shanghai), and they can reel high-grade raw silk with an evenness of 85 points or more, so this point is also not true.</p>
<p>As for "improving machinery" and "cultivating talents," it is of course reasonable to say, but these points do not seem to have much to do with this article. As for citing examples such as double palace, wheat flour, and cotton cloth, may I ask if our country encounters famine and food is insufficient, and there are large quantities of food exports, should it be stopped? This meaning is very clear and does not need to be distinguished, so why is the export of dry cocoons different?</p>
<p>The above points are based on the major points of the argument. Other trivial matters are too numerous to mention. In order to save the space of Shen Bao, I will not go into details.</p>
<p>Editor's note: A few days ago, we received a manuscript from Mr. Jin Sheng, which described the problem of dry cocoon exports. At that time, we thought it was strange that there was such a large export of raw materials when the raw materials for silk making were so scarce, so we disclosed it. Now we have received a manuscript from Mr. Qian Tianda, which seems to be correcting Mr. Jin Sheng's remarks as a defense for dry cocoon exporters. The editor does not care about the identity of the author. When it comes to writing and discussing issues, anyone who can conduct in-depth research will be of great benefit to the matter. However, it is still unclear where this dry cocoon export is going and what it is used for, which can dispel the readers' doubts. From the perspective of the entire silk industry, we also oppose the export of dry cocoons. However, how to preserve raw materials from flowing out cannot be solved by empty arguments. It still depends on the silk cocoon merchants' ability to cooperate and unite in spirit to restore the lost foundation of the sericulture motherland. It also depends on the silk manufacturers' efforts to be enterprising and pay attention to the collection of raw materials!</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Siam Hope to Open a Sino-Siamese Air Route</h3>
<p>Xu Wanting is Negotiating with the China Merchants Bureau</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Xu Geting, a member of the Standing Committee of the Siamese Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, has been back in China to contact the Sino-Siamese Association and the China National Products Sales Association to discuss the affairs of the associations and to carry out matters with the Bangkok China National Products Company, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that Mr. Xu is also meeting with Mr. Cai Zengji, the director of the China Merchants Bureau, to discuss the opening of the Sino-Siamese air route. According to Mr. Xu, no less than 4,000 overseas Chinese travel between Shantou, Hong Kong, and Siam every month, and the import of Siamese rice into China reaches one million tons. There are also many other shipments of timber and seafood. If ships of 3,000 to 4,000 tons with a draft of less than 15 feet operate between Shanghai and Bangkok, passing through Xiamen, Shantou, and Hong Kong, with two sailings per month in each direction, there will definitely be considerable certainty in passenger and freight transport, and it will also be sufficient to facilitate the export of national products and benefit the cultural communication between China and foreign countries. It is reported that Mr. Cai greatly appreciated Mr. Xu's plan and often continued to discuss ways to promote its realization.</p>

<h3>Ms. Gao Yuzhu Gave a Radio Speech on the Problems of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities</h3>
<p>Border Compatriots are Actually the Oldest Ethnic Group in Our Country, and Foreign Aggression and Temptation are Gradually Isolating Them from the Mainland</p>
<p>Ms. Gao Yuzhu, the representative of the chieftains of the southwestern border ethnic minorities who petitioned in Beijing, visited leaders from all walks of life in the city yesterday morning. At noon, she was publicly hosted by Li Shizeng and others, and at 5 p.m., she gave a speech on the "Problems of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities" at the China-West Radio Station. The local association has scheduled a grand tea party to welcome her at the association's location at 3 p.m. today. The details of each situation are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Li Shizeng and Others Gave a Public Banquet at Noon</p>
<p>Ms. Gao Yuzhu, the representative of the chieftains of the southwestern ethnic minorities who petitioned, was warmly welcomed by all walks of life when she passed through Shanghai on her return trip. At 10:00 yesterday morning, Ms. Gao first visited Qian Xinzhi at the Four-Line Savings Association, and then went to the local association to visit Du Yuesheng, Huang Yanpei, and others. They deeply admired Ms. Gao for her petition to Beijing, requesting the reorganization of ethnic minority affairs and the consolidation of border defense. At noon, Li Shizeng, Cui Zhuxi, Huang Jingwan, Liu Zhanen, Zhang Yaozeng, and others held a public banquet for Ms. Gao at the Gongdelin Restaurant. In addition to persuading the guests to inscribe words in ethnic minority languages ​​or Chinese to leave as a souvenir, she also gave a sincere speech, first stating the purpose of her petition from the north, and then describing the lives of the local ethnic minorities and the situation of being invaded by foreign forces. Her loyalty and patriotism were overflowing in her words, and the audience applauded continuously.</p>
<p>The Local Association Will Hold a Tea Party Today</p>
<p>The local association in the city has scheduled a tea party to welcome her at the association's location in the Zhonghui Building at 3 p.m. today. In addition to the leaders from all walks of life in the city who will come to participate, students from Nanjing, and along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, and southwestern students have also been notified to come to Shanghai to participate, which will surely be a grand occasion. It is slightly heard that at the tea party, in addition to inviting Ms. Gao to give a speech, opinions on assisting in the development of the border areas will also be exchanged, so as to improve the culture and improve the lives of ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>Speech on the Problems of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities</p>
<p>Ms. Gao Yuzhu gave a speech on the "Problems of the Southwestern Ethnic Minorities" at the China-West Radio Station at 5 p.m. yesterday. Zhou Bangjun first gave an introductory speech, and then Ms. Gao gave a speech in the ethnic minority language, which was translated by Yu Jiecai. The speech is recorded as follows: Compatriots from all walks of life, our great Republic of China is formed by the joint combination of the Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, and southwestern ethnic minorities. However, many people only know the five ethnic groups of Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan, and do not know that there is also a very large southwestern ethnic minority. Some people even do not understand the term "ethnic minority." Isn't this very ridiculous? Some people think that all people in the southwestern provinces are ethnic minorities, which is an extreme mistake. We must know that most of the inland areas of the southwestern provinces are Han people, and some Han people have assimilated with the literati. Their cultural life is completely as noble and superior as the Han people in the country. The ethnic minorities we are talking about now specifically refer to the ethnic minority compatriots in the border areas of the southwestern provinces. These border compatriots are the oldest ethnic group in our country, that is, the original literati of the Central Plains. For thousands of years, they have had a close relationship with the advanced Han people in the country, and they have also had a lot of relationship with other ethnic groups. However, our southwestern ethnic minorities are located in remote border areas, traffic is blocked, they are overly conservative, and their own culture is extremely backward. They cannot keep pace with the various ethnic groups in the country, but have formed modern primitive humans and uncivilized people. This is very painful for us. Speaking of the entry of the southwestern ethnic minorities, they are scattered in the border areas of Dian, Qian, Chuan, and Kang provinces, with a total of no less than 20 million people, occupying vast and fertile land and possessing extremely rich resources, such as mountain products, medicinal materials, livestock, forests, minerals, agriculture, and so on. It can be said that it is a virgin land that has not been developed in China for thousands of years, which is much superior to other desert border areas. In particular, the heroic and simple ethnic character of tens of millions of ethnic minorities cannot be compared with any other ethnic group. Therefore, many people say that the strong position of the southwest will become China's Angola, and the abundance of products can become the world's greatest industrial area. Some people also say that ethnic minorities are a constituent of the future new culture, and the southwest and ethnic minorities are the lifeline of national defense. All these expectations are indeed equipped with necessary and special conditions. We can believe that there is a possibility that it can be fully expressed in facts. Regarding the problems of the southwestern ethnic minorities, in the past imperial era, the policy of indirect control was used, and the local chieftains were held responsible for protecting the people and maintaining peace. The local chieftains always loved and supported the country because they received the grace of the country. After the Republic of China, the country was in turmoil, and the government was unable to reach them. They were left to fend for themselves, and the border officials were unvirtuous and corrupt, and there was discrimination between ethnic groups. The invasion and temptation of foreign forces gradually isolated them from the mainland. The ethnic minority compatriots in the southwestern region are suffering more and more under the devastation of natural disasters and man-made disasters. The disturbances in the border areas are also becoming more and more serious, directly and indirectly causing great problems in national defense. This is the misfortune of the ethnic minorities themselves, and it is also the greatest hidden worry of the country. Although in the past few years, many wise local officials have tried to develop ethnic minorities and consolidate national defense, their power is weak and they have achieved little success, which we cannot but regret. Now the country is unified, government orders are implemented, and the whole country is working hard to pay attention to the development of the border areas and consolidate national defense. This is the first step in securing the country and resisting foreign aggression, and it is also the way to revive the country and the nation. This time, because we feel the severity of our own suffering and see the international crisis in the southwest, we have gathered the chieftains from all over the southwest to unanimously support the central government and sent us to petition in Beijing from afar. For half a year, we have been grateful to the central government for treating the ethnic minorities in the southwestern border areas equally, and we have been particularly valued by the domestic compatriots, who believe that developing the ethnic minorities in the southwest and increasing the national strength is the most important plan at present. The various opinions we have presented before and after on the education, upbringing, health, and other aspects of the southwestern ethnic minorities have been adopted and processed separately. This is the happiness of the tens of millions of ethnic minorities in the southwest, and it is also the greatest hope for the future of the country. We hope that this virtue of the central government will continue to be implemented, and we especially hope that our local authorities will bear the actual responsibility for us based on the virtue given to us by the central government and do their best to handle it. At the same time, we feel that the heavy and big issue of developing the ethnic minorities in the southwest cannot be done by the government alone. We hope that all sectors of the country will work hard to assist the government. We welcome academic circles to investigate and study. We welcome domestic and overseas Chinese to invest in development. We welcome domestic talents to go to the southwestern border areas to serve and sacrifice for the country and the nation, and to jointly complete the new mission given to us by the times.</p>

On behalf of all the overseas Chinese in Shanghai, I extend my sincere welcome. I believe that those of us living overseas will have closer relations with our country from now on. We all have work to do and cannot accompany you officers on a leisurely tour, which is a pity. Shanghai is one of the largest commercial ports in the world, with the Chinese Municipal Government and the administrative organs of three different nationalities: the Public Concession Bureau, and the French Concession Bureau. The nature is special. We overseas Chinese live here and have a lot of contact with all parties, which is very gratifying. Your visit to China is a friendly one, and you will show the spirit of peaceful unification of our Germany to the people of friendly countries, and this spirit of peaceful unification is also needed by friendly countries (referring to China)," and so on.</p>

The company used the surplus profit to purchase three ships: Longxing, Long'an, and Dapu. As for the state-run China Merchants Bureau, after the autumn of last year, the development of the shipping industry and the huge income from cargo on the Yangtze River and the sea have created the bureau</p>
<p>The latest record is that the daily income from cargo is said to average 900,000 yuan. The Yangtze River route has the best business. Wuhan has a particularly large amount of cargo to be transshipped. Last year, the freight for goods transshipped to other ports alone reached 800,000 yuan, almost the entire operating income of the Commercial Office era. The bureau made a lot of profit last year. In addition to the Emei wheel of the Sichuan River class, which is already being built, a new large-scale new type of Yangtze River wheel and a medium Yangtze River shallow-water cargo wheel have been added. Now, according to the bureau's regulations, for employees who work hard in business,</p>
<p>The awards given to employees in the Hankou Bureau are the best, and the bonus for each employee is calculated according to salary. For example, those with a monthly salary of ten yuan can get a bonus of thirty-five yuan. The Shanghai General Bureau has double salaries, so the bonus is slightly less. Each salary of one yuan can get eight cents, and so on. In addition, the business of Minsheng Industrial Company, which navigates the Sichuan River, was so good last year and the current transportation rate is so high that it is similar to the golden age before the European War. The company's business last year is said to have a surplus of more than one million yuan. In addition to the two express trains, Minyuan and Minben, which have already been built, the Minlian wheel will be added soon. This ship will be docked in the mountains in a few days. This ship will run from Shanghai to Yichang. However, the company's ships have never stopped in the section from Shanghai to Hankou. Now the Minlian wheel will stop at Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Datong, Jiujiang, and Hankou ports, which also operates the lower Yangtze shipping industry.</p>
<h3>Employees of the China Merchants Inland River Bureau Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>Request the Ministry to Withdraw the Order - So as to Avoid Unemployment of Workers on Shipping Routes</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau was ordered by the Ministry of Communications to suspend operations, all 23 shipping routes were completely suspended from the 1st. The ships and properties were all taken over by special commissioners sent by the China Merchants General Bureau, and it was decided to put the bureau's entire staff of more than 1,000 people up for tender and sale, who were suddenly unemployed. Therefore, at 9 o'clock in the morning, a general meeting of employees in Shanghai was held on the bureau's ships on Suzhou Creek. It was resolved to organize a 'Representative Group of Employees on Shenhu Ling and Other Shipping Routes' to handle negotiations, and Shen Jingyi, Shen Guixing, Shen Gendi, Yang Zuomin, Hu Xiaoshu, Chen Meisi, Li Yaoting, Tang Changgen, Cao Ronggui, Zhang Guisheng and other ten people were elected as representatives. At 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon, the representatives submitted a joint petition to the Municipal Government Bureau of Social Affairs and the Municipal Party Department General Labor Union. The original petition is recorded as follows: A petition is submitted to the Ministry of Communications for remittance and requests for relief for unemployed workers and restoration of the original shipping routes to facilitate transportation and maintain people's livelihood. The China Merchants Inland River Shipping Bureau was originally a privately-run company with more than 20 shipping routes, hundreds of branch offices, and was spread throughout the old prefectures of Suzhou, Songjiang, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Tai, Huaiyang, and Zhejiang's Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou. The number of inland river small ports has been around for decades and has always been the crown of the inland river shipping industry. The people of the two provinces have praised its convenience, and thousands of employees and tens of thousands of family members rely on this for their livelihoods. Over the years, we have been safe and sound. Since it was taken over by the government in June of the 24th year of the Republic of China, we have been actively organizing and striving for development, and there is a great atmosphere of revitalization. The employees are all praising and celebrating. Unexpectedly, out of the blue, it was heard that the company would be completely eliminated shortly after taking over. The employees are all unemployed and panicked. Therefore, we gathered together to discuss and publicly elected Zhang Yizhong, the son of the former head of the Inland River Bureau, Yi Zeng, as the plenipotentiary representative to submit a petition to the Ministry for relief. After receiving the approval, we were entrusted to contact the China Merchants General Bureau to undertake it. A contract was signed on December 21st of the 25th year and a deposit of 10,000 yuan was paid to the bureau, and an official receipt was given. The contract stated that the entire transfer would be handled on January 16th of the 26th year. The China Merchants General Bureau was requested to work hard to sign the agreement, and Lawyer Feng was present to testify. The employees, although hoarse and exhausted, were spared the pain of unemployment. Unexpectedly, a disturbance arose and the bureau was ordered to abolish the previous agreement. Therefore, on the 18th of the month, the employees of each shipping route gathered to discuss and publicly elected representatives Jingyi and others to submit a petition to the China Merchants General Bureau and the Bureau of Social Affairs on the afternoon of the 19th. While waiting for a solution, on January 22, we received a reply from the China Merchants General Bureau stating that the request was not approved on the grounds that it was still ordered by the Ministry of Communications to suspend shipping. Thousands of employees were disappointed and will put their lives on the line. At this time of national impoverishment and displacement, it is unbearable to see such trampling and high-pressure tactics when the country is not providing relief. Therefore, we have no choice but to jointly petition the employees of Shenhu Ling, Suxi, and other shipping routes. In addition to submitting petitions to the Municipal Party Department, the General Labor Union, and various agencies, we implore your Excellency to grant relief and find a way to achieve success, so as to avoid unemployment and maintain the people's livelihood. We also implore the Ministry of Communications to withdraw the order and restore the original shipping routes, so as to live up to the original intention of the first Prime Minister's revolution to relieve the small and weak people. We are extremely urgent to await orders.</p>
<h3>Workers of the New Beijing Wheel Request Work Solution</h3>
<p>Supported by New Ningxing Wheel Workers - Subsidize Living Expenses</p>
<p>After the New Beijing Wheel of the Shanghai-Ningbo class of the British Swire Shipping Company hit a reef and entered the dock for repairs, it was rented to the New Ning and wheel of the Sanbei Company to replace the voyage because it would take a month to complete. It sailed for the first time last night. The original workers of the New Beijing wheel requested the Seamen's Union to work on the ship yesterday. Secretary Wang Ji-yi, Section Chief Wang Yalun, Chairman of the Shanghai Branch Peng Bowei, and members Lu Shuangxi, Shou Yufeng, and Cheng Yongming mediated between the two parties yesterday afternoon. As a result, the New Beijing workers will wait ashore for repairs to be completed before being assigned work. During this period, the New Ning and workers will subsidize the New Beijing workers with living expenses for each trip. Both parties were satisfied at the time, and the dispute was temporarily resolved.</p>
<h3>Charity Groups and Disaster Relief Associations Urge Payment of Recognized Donations</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Letters Were Sent to Each Member for Immediate Delivery</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Groups United Relief Association sent letters to each member yesterday urging payment of recognized donations so that they could be remitted to the disaster area for distribution. Dear Sirs, The bandit rebels committed crimes in Sui, and fortunately, our soldiers used their lives to repeatedly thwart the fierce atmosphere. However, the compatriots in the war zone are displaced and urgently need relief. In view of this, the various charitable groups in this city initiated the organization of the Shanghai Charity Groups United Relief Association and have been appealing for donations for relief. I have always admired your enthusiasm, perseverance, and charitable heart, and I deeply admire you. Please donate generously and hand over the donation to our association immediately, or to the Central China Transportation Shanghai Gold City Bank and other banks, and Fu Yuan Heng Xun Money Bank, so that it can be remitted to the disaster area to save the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Company Seeks to Restore Ping-Yue Route</h3>
<p>The opening and closing of the Eurasia Airlines Company's direct Eurasia route has been repeatedly hindered and has not yet been realized, but it is still working hard. The domestic routes have shortened the transportation between the northwest and south border provinces and the capital and Shanghai, arriving in one or two days. It has made a great contribution to communicating domestic economy and culture. The solution to the Shaanxi Incident in the short term was also due to the convenience of transportation. Although the regular postal flights between Xi'an and Lanzhou have not been restored, the company's routes fly to the two places every day to prepare for the travel of government officials and escort foreigners out of the country. It is heard that the company's Ping-Yue line was opened before the year, but due to the Yangtze River flood and the inundation of the airports in Changsha and other places, only the section from Beiping to Zhengzhou is temporarily operating. Now the company is planning to restore the entire line. The first step is to go from Beiping to Hankou via Zhengzhou. Depending on the business situation, we will consider restoring flights to Guangzhou. It is currently being submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Bank on Xinzha Road Robbed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Police and Detectives in Fierce Gunbattle with Robbers, One Policeman Killed, Two Wounded</p>
<p>At approximately 5:10 PM yesterday, a robbery suddenly occurred at the Xinzha branch of Jiangsu Bank, located at the bridgehead of Wuzhen Road on Xinzha Road in the Public Concession. The bank usually stops transactions at 4:00 PM every day. However, the daily deposits and remaining balances must wait for the arrival of the main branch's cashier car to deliver the funds before ending the day's work. This had become a routine, but unfortunately, this was learned by the robbers. Yesterday, when the cashier car arrived at the entrance of the Xinzha branch, a robber car followed. The car was coffee-colored and resembled a Yunfei Company car. The cashier did not notice anything at the time. When he entered the counter to collect the suspicious items, the robbers in the car rushed in, drew their pistols, and shouted for silence, grabbing several bundles of banknotes totaling 7,000 yuan and fleeing. At that time, the bank's employed policeman, Gu Wenlin (顧文林), a 42-year-old from Yangzhou, saw that things were not good and wanted to draw his pistol to fire. However, a robber standing next to him snatched the pistol from the policeman's hand and then fired several shots, wounding the policeman and knocking him to the ground. The robbers, about four or five in number, rushed into the car and tried to escape. However, the last robber was chased by Jiang Zigen (姜子根), a 31-year-old Shandong native who was the bodyguard of the main branch's cashier car. The two sides engaged in a fierce gunbattle with box cannons and pistols. The robber fled while fighting and threw a pistol and several bundles of banknotes snatched from the policeman onto the road before getting into the car and speeding away to the west. A rickshaw puller was also injured by a stray bullet. While the bodyguard Jiang Zigen was in a fierce gunbattle with the robbers, he was also wounded by the robbers. However, he still turned around to pick up the banknotes and a pistol that the robbers had abandoned on the road. When the Xinzha police station learned of this, they immediately dispatched patrol cars and Chinese and Western detectives to the scene. However, the robbers' car was nowhere to be found. The wounded policeman, bodyguard, and rickshaw puller, Chen Youlu (陳有祿), from Yancheng, were taken to Baolong Hospital (寶隆醫院) for treatment. Before long, the employed policeman died of his serious injuries. The bank's entrance was stained with blood, which was unbearable to witness. Later, the Western detectives collected several bullet casings and took them back as evidence, while investigating the source of the robbers' car. It was then learned that the car was indeed rented from the Yunfei Car Rental Company (雲飛汽車行) on Jing'an Temple Road (靜安寺路) at around 3:30 PM by two men and one woman, all around the age of 30, who claimed to be going to Lincoln Road (林肯路). At that time, the company dispatched car rental license No. 12314 and city license No. 4264. When the car reached the intersection of Lincoln Road, the men and women in the car shouted for the driver to stop and forced him out of the car with pistols. The driver had no choice but to leave the car. At that time, one of the robbers sat in the driver's seat and drove off. The driver waited until the car was far away and then ran to the nearby police station to report the incident. Sure enough, not long after, the robbers in the car committed the robbery on Xinzha Road. However, after the gunbattle, the robbers still managed to escape in the car. Therefore, the police station and police authorities are making every effort to investigate the whereabouts of the car. It was not until around 9:00 PM that it was discovered within the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road police station. The robbers had long since disappeared. The police station sent personnel to inspect it and took it back to the police station, notifying Yunfei Company to claim it.</p>
<h3>Fire Caused by Decanting Stolen Kerosene</h3>
<p>Apprentice Wang Guisheng Severely Burned and Died; Police Closely Pursuing Fugitive Culprit Feng Huisheng</p>
<p>A fire broke out at the Xiangji Clothing Store (祥記成衣舖) at No. 1296 Lafayette Road (辣斐德路) in the French Concession at 2:50 PM on the 28th of last month, causing the fire to spread and burn an apprentice. The fire brigade rushed to put out the fire and sent the injured person to the hospital for treatment. It is now known that the Texaco Oil Company (德士古火油公司) in this city has had more than 1,000 gallons of kerosene stolen in succession. Although it has been reported to the police, the case has not been solved. Feng Huisheng (馮惠生), a 20-year-old man from Yangzhou, who lives in the kitchen of the Xiangji Clothing Store at No. 1296 Lafayette Road, has recently specialized in buying stolen kerosene from Texaco Company. He buys it for 80 cents per gallon and sells it for 1.05 yuan, making a profit of 15 cents per gallon in one transaction. Because the quantity is quite large, the profit is very high. At 2:50 PM on the 28th of last month, Feng opened a large barrel of kerosene in his room to decant it into smaller barrels for sale. While pouring, he accidentally spilled some kerosene, which splashed onto a nearby stove. The stove was burning, causing a sudden explosion and fire, which could not be contained for a while. The apprentice of the clothing store, Yu Guisheng (于桂生), a 14-year-old man from Shishi, was watching nearby and was burned on his head, face, and hands. Seeing that he had caused the disaster, Feng fled immediately. The fire brigade rushed to put out the fire and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital (廣慈醫院). However, due to the fire toxins attacking his heart, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 1:00 AM yesterday. The hospital notified the police station, which transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall (同仁輔元分堂) mortuary. Yesterday, Wang, the prosecutor of the Special No. 2 Court, confirmed the death. The father of the deceased, Wang Anxiang (王安香), claimed the body for inspection. The French police station charged the fugitive culprit Feng Huisheng with the crimes of buying stolen goods, profiting from them, and causing death through negligence. An order was issued to all detectives to arrest Feng and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>International Banker from Paris Finds Love in Shanghai Dance Hall</h3>
<p>Secretly Engaged to 'Ciro's' Dancer, Quietly Boarded the Nagasaki Maru Yesterday Morning for Japan</p>
<p>The English *China Press* reports that a young international banker, Mr. Lubin Stein, recently came to the Far East from Paris on business. It is widely believed that his business involves large transactions between the Chinese and Japanese governments. He is currently staying at the Cathay Hotel in Shanghai and often visits the Ciro's dance hall on Jing'an Temple Road for entertainment. In the hall, there is a dancer, Ms. Setto, who is in her prime, beautiful and charming. Mr. Lu fell in love at first sight and gave her many gifts.</p>
<p>After a long time of affection,</p>
<p>he proposed to her, and the woman readily agreed. However, the two did not tell the hall owner about this matter. Mr. Lu only used a large sum of money to ask the hall owner to terminate the woman's contract. The hall owner refused because the woman was able to attract a general customer. Therefore, this pair of lovers secretly packed their luggage and quietly boarded the Nagasaki Maru this morning (the 3rd) and sailed to Japan at 9:00 AM. The woman's mother also went with her. The woman was still</p>
<p>Performing on Stage</p>
<p>last night, so no one knew that she was about to leave Shanghai. This morning, after the Nagasaki Maru set sail, a reporter from the *China Press* visited Mr. Kaufman, the manager of the hall. According to him, the woman disregarded the contract and eloped with her lover, which is not in line with reason. However, he sincerely wished that this pair of lovers would have an early marriage</p>
<p>and share happiness.</p>
<p>If he had known earlier that they were engaged, he would have been happy to terminate the woman's contract. It is said that Mr. Lu's father was a banker of the Russian emperor before the Russian Revolution. When his family went to Paris from Russia, they brought with them a lot of valuable jewelry. Some of these jewels will surely become the woman's decorations in the near future.</p>
<h3>Suzhou River Blocked Yesterday Due to Congestion</h3>
<p>Blocked for Four Hours, Water Police Immediately Cleared It</p>
<p>A Suzhou dispatch states that every year at the end of the lunar year, inland villagers sail their boats to Shanghai to purchase goods and daily necessities, causing the water traffic on the Suzhou River to be frequently blocked. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the river surface was blocked again, completely cutting off traffic from the Old Zha Bridge to the New Zha Bridge. The second squadron of the water police in charge immediately dispatched patrol boats to dredge and clear the area. It was not until after 6:00 PM that the traffic was restored. In addition, the river surface under the Tianhou Palace Bridge on the Suzhou River was also congested with boats. At the same time, the Dredging Bureau's dredgers were also dredging the river channel there, which made the river channel narrower and blocked it for a moment. It was not until late at night that the traffic was dredged and cleared.</p>
<h3>Maid Interrogated in Qin Zhen Home Theft Case</h3>
<p>Qin Zhen (覃振), the President of the Judicial Yuan of the National Government, is 50 years old and a native of Taoyuan, Hunan. His Beijing residence is at No. 20 Lujia Road, Xiaoxi Road (小西路盧家路), and his Shanghai residence is at No. 97 Massenet Road (馬斯南路) in the French Concession. His wife and son live in Shanghai most of the time. His eldest son, Qin Wen (覃文), is 8 years old this year, and his second son, Qin Wu (覃武), is 2 years old this year. Therefore, in February of last year, he hired Yu He (兪何氏), a woman from Anhui, to be a nanny, specifically to take care of his second son. Since Yu He came to the Shanghai residence, there had been thefts, but because there were many servants, it was difficult to investigate at once, and the amount was small, so no further investigation was made. Recently, valuable ornaments used by Vice President Qin, such as gold seals, gold watches, and gold chains, worth a considerable amount, were stolen again. Yang Baisheng (楊柏生), the secretary of the Qin residence, reported this to the French police station. Detectives Li Tiqing (李悌青) and Wang Wenhua (王文華) went to investigate and suspected the nanny Yu He. They took her to the police station, where she confessed after interrogation. She confessed that her husband, Yu Shixue (俞士學), had instigated the theft and that two pawn tickets were found in her clothes. Her husband, Yu Shixue, was also arrested and confessed to the conspiracy without denial. Detectives also investigated the stolen goods. Yesterday's newspaper has already reported on this briefly. Yesterday, the police station sent the defendants to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. Judge Pi Songlin (𣓾松鄰) interrogated them. Yao Zhaodi (姚肇弟), a lawyer from the police department, explained the case. Yu He confessed to the theft, while Yu Shixue denied it, claiming that he did not know about his wife's theft. The court summoned Gu Jianzhang (股建章), the representative of the plaintiff, Qin's residence, and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 6th. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Butler Steals Gold and Silver Utensils Worth 200,000 Francs</h3>
<p>Thief Hu Yunong Arrested and Sent for Interrogation</p>
<p>Hu Yunong (胡雨農), a 21-year-old man from Ningbo, worked as a butler in the home of a Westerner at No. 1302 Avenue Joffre (霞飛路) in the French Concession. Recently, he suddenly became unscrupulous. On the night of the 16th of last month, while his master was out, he stole gold and silver ornaments and utensils worth 100,000 francs and fled. The owner discovered this and reported it to the French police station, requesting an investigation. Detective Ke Siqing (柯思慶) of the French police station learned that Hu was hiding in the Public Concession and that he would definitely pass by the front of the Central Cinema (中央影戲院) on Sixth Avenue (六馬路) every afternoon. Therefore, the detective Ke, along with an informant, waited in front of the Central Cinema the day before yesterday. Soon, they saw Hu walking by and arrested him, taking him back to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court. The lawyer from the police department requested an adjournment for further investigation and then filed a lawsuit for interrogation. After Judge Yang (楊推) questioned the defendant, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 10th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<p>The Central Bank (中央银行) has stated that due to the approaching year-end accounting period for various industrial and commercial sectors, the demand for copper subsidiary coins has increased sharply. In order to circulate the market and meet the needs of society, it has specially entrusted the Shanghai Tobacco Exchange Association (上海市烟兌業同業公會) to entrust 100 contracted businesses to handle the exchange of one-cent new copper subsidiary coins to promote widespread circulation.

<h3>Nagasaki Maru Post Office</h3>
<p>The *Japanese Daily News* (日文每日新聞) reports that the Sino-Japanese connecting ship *Nagasaki Maru* (‘長崎丸’) entered the port at 2:30 PM on the 2nd. The post office inside the ship has begun to handle postal affairs on this voyage to ensure the safety and speed of important Sino-Japanese mail delivery.

For example, if it leaves Shanghai at 9:00 AM on the 3rd, it can be delivered to the special express train leaving the Nagasaki Dejima (長崎出島) wharf at 2:30 PM on the 4th, arriving in Tokyo at 4:00 PM on the 5th and Osaka at 9:00 AM on the 9th. Because the time inside the ship is used to process affairs, the round-trip delivery time can be significantly reduced.</p>

<h3>Yongxin Fast Steamer Had Accident Near Pingwang</h3>
<p>More Than Sixty Passengers, Only Three Rescued</p>
<p>A Suzhou dispatch states that the Yongxin (永新) daytime fast steamer of the Shanghai Yongshun Steamer Company (上海永順輪船公司) had an accident at 12:30 PM yesterday in the Hunshui River (渾水河) area, between Pingwang (平望) and Lili (黎里). While turning east, due to the river being more than ten feet wide and the wind being strong, the passengers also leaned to the left, causing the ship to become unstable and sink. Nearby civilian boats heard the alarm and rushed to rescue. The ship had more than 40 passengers in the cabin and more than 20 on the bamboo deck. The passengers on the bamboo deck all fell into the river. Three people were rescued by civilian boats, and six bodies (four men and three women) were recovered. The whereabouts of the rest are unknown. The ship's mate, Mao Quangen (毛泉根), drowned. Forty to fifty bolts of silk, twenty-odd suitcases, and eighty to ninety pieces of luggage were recovered. The whereabouts of the ship's accountants, Zhang Zhenfu (張眞甫) and Miao Fagen (繆發根), are also unknown. The Pingwang shipping office has telegraphed the Shanghai head office to find a way to deal with the aftermath and has reported the matter to the authorities for inspection.</p>
<p>The *New Voice News* (新聲社) reports that the Yongxin (永新) and Yongan (永安) steamers of the Yongshun Steamer Company at No. 458 North Suzhou Road (北蘇州路四五八號) specialize in the Shanghai-Huzhou route and depart daily. The Yongxin steamer departed from Huzhou for Shanghai at 9:00 AM yesterday, carrying passengers and cargo. At 2:00 PM, about five or six miles past Pingwang, it hit a reef, damaging the bottom of the ship. Because the port there is very large, deep, and wide, the ship sank, and passengers and cargo fell into the water. Fortunately, nearby civilian boats heard the alarm and rushed to rescue. Most of the passengers and crew were rescued, but the captain, Wang Jingen (王金根), drowned. The exact number of deaths is difficult to ascertain at this time. The Shanghai company sent someone surnamed Bi (畢) to the scene of the accident last night to handle the aftermath after receiving a long-distance call from Pingwang.</p>
<h3>Chen Chugen Sues Chen Chuxiang Case to Confirm Siblinghood</h3>
<p>Claims voice and appearance are similar to the defendants, defendants also present evidence to deny everything</p>
<p>Merchant Chen Chugen, 29 years old, recently hired lawyers Yang Tianxun and Zhu Wende to sue Chen Chuxiang, Chen Chufan, and Chen Chugao, shareholders of Huacheng Tobacco Company, in the First Special District Court, seeking confirmation as brothers. The plaintiff's claim is that the plaintiff and the defendants are all sons of Zhu Wen, with the plaintiff being the youngest. After the plaintiff's birth, the defendants became jealous and tried to make the plaintiff leave the clan, eventually achieving their goal. Wenjian publicly gave the plaintiff to relatives Yao Chaolun and Yao Bao, a couple, as an adopted son, named Zhicheng. In 1922, when the plaintiff was 14 years old, Wenjian passed away, and the defendants secretly kept the plaintiff from knowing. It was not until the plaintiff was 16 or 17 years old that Yao Bao slightly revealed the truth. In 1929, Yao Bao drove the plaintiff away, terminated the adoption, and pursued the surname Guan Chupu, named Yang. Now that the plaintiff knows the whole story, he is filing a lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo Can heard the case in the Civil Division and summoned the defendants. The defendants did not appear, and a lawyer represented them. First, Chen Chugen explained the facts of the lawsuit, stating that his face and voice were exactly the same as the three defendants. This alone is enough to prove that they are indeed brothers. If the defendants deny it, a blood test should be requested. Then, the defendants' lawyer rose to protest, saying that the plaintiff was not their brother. At that time, the defendants' older sister had hired a wet nurse surnamed, and the plaintiff was born to her. Because she was hired out, she could no longer raise him herself, so she planned to give him away. Through the introduction of the defendant's older sister, he was adopted by Yao Bao as a son. Later, because the plaintiff grew up and spent money excessively, Yao Bao broke off relations with the plaintiff and gave him 15,000 yuan as a condition for separation. Afterwards, the plaintiff repeatedly litigated with her, all resulting in defeats. Therefore, he has filed this lawsuit and presented various evidences. After hearing the facts of the case, the judge ordered the case to be adjourned for further hearing and ordered the defendants to appear in court in person for questioning.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Use Lottery to Reduce the Number of Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Approved by the Board of Directors Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council had previously decided to reduce the number of public rickshaws to 9,500 from March 1 this year. The Council announced this decision in September last year and entrusted the Council's Rickshaw Special Committee to consider the methods to implement this decision. The Committee had written to the Rickshaw Trade Association to express its views on the most fair implementation method that the Association considered for reference. However, the Association replied that it was unwilling to express its views until the Municipal Council had fully explained the reasons and intentions for reducing the number of rickshaws. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rickshaw Special Committee believed that this response allowed the Municipal Council to handle the matter at its discretion and submitted the following three recommendations to the Board of Directors: 1. The Municipal Council should announce in Chinese and Western newspapers that it would reduce the number of rickshaws by 484 from February 28 this year. 2. The reduction should be decided by lottery. All public rickshaws, except for one pulled by the owner himself, should participate to ensure fairness. 3. The lottery should be held at 2:00 p.m. on Saturday, February 13. The commander of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps should be requested to lend the Corps' parade ground and all necessary items. The lottery should be conducted jointly by the Police Department and the Tax Bureau, and the Rickshaw Trade Association should be formally invited to send two representatives to attend. The results of the lottery should be announced by the Municipal Council in a bulletin as soon as possible. The above recommendations were approved by the Shanghai Municipal Council at a meeting on February 3.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Industry's Monthly Report Postponed for Three Months</h3>
<p>The Cotton Cloth Trade Association previously received an order from the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau to submit a monthly report form for the purchase of yarn and cloth starting in January. The Association believed that this would require hiring an employee to be responsible, which would inevitably increase expenses. Therefore, it jointly sent a letter with the related trade associations such as the Knitting Industry, the Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry, and the Towel Industry to the Tax Bureau to request a postponement of implementation. However, because the reply was not approved, the Association sent representatives Ke Ganchen, Ye Xiaoshan, Zheng Hairuo, etc., together with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative Jin Runxiang to the Tax Bureau and the Unified Tax Bureau yesterday afternoon to petition. The section chief Shen Fuqiang and the deputy director Xue received them. First, the representatives stated the difficulties in filling out the form and requested a postponement of implementation in order to start preparing. Then, the section chief Shen and the deputy director Xue decided on three accommodating measures: 1. Approval is granted to postpone implementation for two months, and reporting will begin in April. 2. For each column in the form, if there are indeed difficulties in filling it out, a request can be submitted for appropriate modification. 3. The original punishment of canceling the registration of merchants who do not fill out the form is considered too severe and will be reduced.</p>

<h3>Night Soil Carrier Yao Qiansheng Impersonates Sanitation Worker</h3>
<p>Forcibly Uses Zhenxin Factory Pier and Fabricates False Accusations Against a Woman</p>
<p>The Xinji Zhishi Powder Factory, located at 397 Jessfield Road, is organized by commercial tycoon Jin Runxiang and others, and managed by Ma Shaoquan, the former executive member of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. The factory is large in scale and has a thriving business. The factory had obtained a shoreline pier license from the Land Bureau for the loading and unloading of goods and built a dedicated pier for the factory to facilitate transportation. Previously, the pier had been occupied by nearby docked night soil boats, which had been strictly prohibited by the local Public Security Bureau. On January 18 this year, another night soil boatman trespassed into the pier to unload night soil. The factory workers came forward to stop them. Unexpectedly, a night soil carrier named Yao Qiansheng (also known as Xinwei) claimed to be a sanitation bureau employee and made trouble for the workers. The factory worker Xu Cheng reported to the Zhoujiaqiao Police Station of the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched officers to the scene and took both parties to the station. They were transferred to the Caojiadu Sub-bureau, which ordered the night soil boats to leave the pier and strictly prohibited them from encroaching again. Unexpectedly, Yao Qiansheng used the female's fear of shame and falsely claimed that the wife of the factory manager Ma Shaoquan had committed a crime of obstructing freedom, and groundlessly filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Procuratorate of the Local Court. The factory, believing that the matter was fabricated, has legally filed a lawsuit to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3>Kangyuan Factory Appeal Heard by the Third Branch of the High Court</h3>
<p>The Kangyuan Printing and Can Making Factory on Huade Road in this city and Gu Qiushui, a former porcelain department engineer, filed a case for compensation for damages. Dissatisfied with the First Special District Court's decision, they filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The court approved the appeal and heard the case in the Civil Third Court at 9:00 a.m. yesterday. Both the plaintiff and the defendant arrived in court on time with their lawyers. After Judge Tong took his seat, he first inquired about the appellant's intention to sue. Zhang Xiang, the representative of the factory, testified that Gu Qiushui had worked in the factory for three years since 1922 and made a lot of bad porcelain paper. Customers could not use it, so they returned the goods one after another, resulting in a loss of more than 20,000 yuan. According to the contract, the technician who made the bad goods should be liable for one-fifth of the price. Therefore, he requested that the respondent be ordered to pay the loss of 4,542.68 yuan. (Question) How do you know that the products are not good? (Answer) The porcelain paper made by the respondent is because 1. the ingredients do not match the kiln temperature of the user, 2. the patterns and colors are very blurred and dull, and there are cracks, 3. the address of the issuing office is printed on the porcelain paper on Jiangxi Road, and the Big Knife brand trademark. After Gu Qiushui was dismissed on May 27, 1935, the products made by the revised version printed the rice bowl brand trademark, and the address of the issuing office has been selected to Guangdong Road. This is clear evidence. After the testimony, the damaged porcelain paper and fired porcelain dishes were presented to the court. Judge Tong then questioned Gu Qiushui, who testified that the porcelain paper he made during his tenure was all in good condition. The reason why the temperature was not suitable was because the kiln users used different fire temperatures, which could not be regarded as a technical error. As for the return of goods, it may be due to market conditions and flower styles, so he could not bear the responsibility for compensation. (Question) Did you make the Jiangxi Road address and the Big Knife brand products? (Answer) Yes, I made them, but I have been retired for a long time and cannot admit it. Then, the appellant testified that customers also returned goods when Gu Qiushui was in office. Gu signed the word "repair" on the delivery note, and Gu also signed on the damaged porcelain paper base, which could be used as evidence. He presented the delivery note and the porcelain paper base. After reading it, Judge Tong turned to Gu Qiushui and asked, Do you admit this visa? Gu said that it was signed by me, but I really cannot afford to compensate for this loss. (Question) Are you willing to reconcile this case? According to the appellant, the loss suffered by our factory is significant, so it is not convenient to reconcile. He requested that the respondent be ordered to compensate in accordance with the agreement. At this point, because the court must conduct a detailed investigation, the court adjourned the hearing for further review.</p>
<h3>Two Retired Chinese Constables Connected to Robbery Case</h3>
<p>Both Were Arrested by the Police, Awaiting Further Investigation and Interrogation</p>
<p>Chinese and Western detectives from the Avenue Haig Police Station previously arrested four bandits, including Luo Wenqing, who were interrogated by the First Special District Court and sentenced to imprisonment. However, at the time, Luo and others testified in court that Yang Yuchun (also known as Yang Qingchen), a Chinese constable No. 1558 from Shandong who had already retired, was also involved in the robbery of the residents of No. 45 Heyu Lane, Wuzhou Road, on December 23 last year at 7:30 p.m. The First Special Court issued an arrest warrant. Yesterday afternoon at around 6:00 p.m., Liu Qingsheng and Han Shoushan, Chinese detectives from the General Police Station, learned that Yang must pass through the vicinity of Dongyouheng Road, Tongzhou Road, so they went to wait. They saw Yang and another Shandong native, Zhang Wenxuan, coming along, so they stepped forward and arrested them together and brought them back to the police station. It was found that Zhang Wenxuan had also served as a Chinese constable in the police station, but he has now retired and should be detained. Yesterday morning, Ru Baoqi, a lawyer from the First Special Court's Criminal First Tribunal, stated the previous situation and requested permission for detention because the defendant had just been arrested and had not yet been subjected to detailed investigation, so as to investigate and prosecute the crime. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered that he be detained for one week for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Nanxing Wall Collapse Injures People</h3>

It has been 18 years and they have a 14-year-old son. Now that Tan has entered the compradore class, he has abandoned his old wife and married Du Lanru, a young girl, ignoring Shi and her son. The said lady hired a lawyer and filed a criminal self-accusation against Tan in the First Special District Local Court based on Article 229 of the Criminal Law. The court held a hearing previously, but the defendant evaded and did not appear. The hearing was postponed to yesterday afternoon, and Judge Xiao again summoned both parties to court for questioning. According to the plaintiff Shi Minren, at the beginning of the cohabitation, because the defendant was still poor, the wedding was not held. Now that he is a compradore in Dechang Foreign Company, he has married another woman and abandoned me. The defendant Tan Zhaohui also admitted that he had lived with Shi, Xiao Judge said that the crime was committed in the Chinese territory, so according to the agreement, it should not be under the jurisdiction of the concession court. Therefore, he immediately ruled that the jurisdiction of this case was wrong and waited to be transferred to the Shanghai Local Court for trial.</p>

<h3>Two Acts of Righteousness in Zhuyai</h3>
<p>— Zheng Kan Ci</p>
<p>Many tragedies in families are caused by misunderstandings. To dispel misunderstandings, one must rely on wisdom and utmost sincerity.</p>
<p>Here was a very happy family—a loving young couple, living with an adorable little baby—but since the wife fell ill, everything good changed. The husband was a very responsible schoolteacher. Even during their honeymoon period, he never left school early for even a single day. Other teachers were already home having dinner by 5 PM, but he was still at school, packing up, preparing to return home. His wife understood him very well. No matter how late he came home, she always greeted him with a smile, waiting for him to eat together. With the child, things were even better. At the time, she would first prepare the food and put it in the steamer, then carry the child to the gate to meet her husband. Sometimes, she would be so engrossed in her happiness, so carried away, that she wouldn't notice her husband approaching. But the child wasn't like her. As soon as her father rounded the corner at the alley entrance, the child would see him immediately. She would wave to her father with one hand and push her mother with the other, jumping up and down, eager to throw herself into her father's arms. At the same time, she would keep shouting, "Daddy! Come quickly! Daddy, come and hold baby!" When they got together, the wife would say to the baby, "Baby, Daddy is tired, give Daddy a kiss!" In such a fervent welcome, the husband was so happy he couldn't speak. He would stand there, letting the baby kiss him, and then pretend to tickle the baby, secretly wiping the tears from his eyes on the baby's bib. Truly, he was moved to tears with gratitude.</p>
<p>Once the wife fell ill, things were no longer the same. She lay in bed all day, not wanting to pay attention to anyone. She was afraid of loneliness and liked having someone keep her company. As soon as her husband went to school, she would want him to come back immediately. When she couldn't wait any longer, all sorts of doubts arose. She doubted her husband's love and feared that she would die. Sometimes, she even thought, "If I die, the baby must come with me. I can't leave a piece of my flesh in this world to suffer like Ping'er!" The thought of Ping'er terrified her, and she shivered uncontrollably.</p>
<p>It turned out that she had a niece named Ping'er. Ping'er's mother died when she was three years old. The following year, her father married a stepmother who treated her very cruelly. She wasn't allowed to eat her fill, and she wore the same set of tattered clothes all year round. Because this woman was fiercely shrewish, everyone in the family was afraid of her, and no one dared to protect Ping'er and offend her. At that time, Ping'er's aunt (the sick wife mentioned earlier) was still young and certainly didn't dare to offend her sister-in-law. Even when she sometimes gave Ping'er something to eat, she had to do it behind her sister-in-law's back. She would always remember Ping'er's timid, pitiful appearance. Ping'er died the second month after her aunt got married. It was said that because she accidentally broke a vase, her stepmother forbade her from eating for two days. She was so hungry that she secretly went to the kitchen to steal cat food. Afraid of being caught, she hurriedly gulped it down, accidentally swallowing a large bone that got stuck in her throat. She couldn't swallow it down or cough it up and died of cold that same day.</p>
<p>She usually thought about this tragedy, and who knows how many tears she shed. How much more so now that she was sick and thinking about it? Originally, having such a lively little baby could have broken the silence for the patient and made her happy, but she always thought about this terrible event. Having a little baby only increased her pain. Because she was so apprehensive, her illness naturally worsened day by day.</p>
<p>Because there was no one at home to take care of the patient and the child, the husband had no choice but to leave school one or two hours early every day. He thought that doing this was too much and always felt like he was bearing a great wrong, which was very difficult to endure. When he came home, everything urgently needed attention, and he didn't know which task to tackle first! The child's diaper was full of feces and urine, and she was crying to be changed. The wife's spittoon had overturned, making a mess of the bed, and she was also crying. The porridge that had been simmering in the kitchen since morning had burned and turned yellow and black, but the stove had no warmth at all. The basin of dirty clothes that had been soaking for a month emitted a foul odor that made people want to vomit as soon as they entered the house. At the same time, the three of them were wearing their last set of clothes, which were so dirty they had to be changed. ... He was dizzy and busy for half a day and half a night but couldn't manage anything. On the other hand, the wife couldn't bear it any longer and began to complain!</p>
<p>"Achu's (the baby's name) father! My life won't last more than a few days. Can you take care of me? Alas! I've wanted to defecate since morning, but because I can't get out of bed, I've been holding it in until now." When the husband heard this, he hurried over, helping her while saying, "You should have said so earlier!" The wife leaned weakly against her husband, saying, "Don't make sarcastic remarks. Tell me, all day long, when were you by my side? This morning, when you left, I begged, 'I'm so lonely, take a day off from school and keep me company!' You replied heartlessly, 'My responsibilities are here, I can't!' You saw how uncomfortable I was and therefore came up with an idea to deceive me, 'Good sister, you understand me, don't you know I love you the most? Endure it for me; I will definitely leave school early today. When I come back, I'll tell you stories and cheer you up.' I was so foolish, I believed your words and happily lay in bed waiting. I didn't expect to wait all day long, and it was dark before I saw you come back, and you still tried to avoid me. Okay! I know your heart!" After saying this, she began to sob.</p>
<p>The husband didn't have the wife's eloquence. His head was full of reasons, but he couldn't express them. When he left in the morning, he had promised his wife to come back and tell her stories and had also said a few words to comfort her, but not as pleasant as the wife had embellished it. He was in a hurry for a long time and finally managed to stop the wife's tears. He knew that now was the time to fulfill his promise of telling a story. He tidied up for his wife, made the bed, and sat on the edge of the bed, asking, "What do you want to hear?" The wife, as usual, became more gentle after venting her temper. The corners of her eyes were still wet, but there was already a smile on her face. Although the near-sighted husband couldn't see anything clearly in the dim light, he knew from her soft words that she had calmed down. She replied, "Didn't you say you would tell a story? I just love to hear stories."</p>
<p>"Okay, you love to hear stories, I'll tell stories; you love to hear stories, I'll find stories..." He repeated these two sentences several times, mechanically speaking the words while thinking, "What story should I tell her? Where can I find a story?" He was thinking so intently that the baby, who was sleeping at the foot of the bed, woke up and needed to urinate. He quickly turned around to hold her. After she finished urinating, she pointed to her mouth and cried, "Mommy, hungry, baby wants to eat." When the wife heard this, she quickly asked the husband, "Hasn't the baby eaten yet?" The husband yawned a long yawn before lazily replying, "She did eat, but she fell asleep after eating only half a stomach." The wife's face immediately darkened and she angrily said, "It's all because you don't know how to feed her. How could she fall asleep after eating only half? Good person, seeing that you can't come up with a story, you'd better heat up some porridge and feed her! I want to eat some too." When the husband heard that he was excused from telling a story, he felt like he had received a pardon and immediately sneaked away.</p>
<p>After a while, the husband brought the porridge in, but both the wife and the baby were already fast asleep. The husband didn't want to disturb them, so he put the two bowls of porridge in the rice container. At this time, the last drumbeats of the night watch had already sounded, and the husband knew it was almost five in the morning, so he quickly extinguished the candle and went to bed. The husband had just fallen into a hazy sleep when he was suddenly awakened by the wife's nightmare. She tightly hugged the husband, constantly crying "Ping'er," like she was crazy. The husband finally managed to bring her back to her senses. After waking up, the wife cried to the husband, "Touch me, I have a fever all over my body, like a hot coal. That's how Sister-in-law died, I know I'm almost there too. Alas, in the future, the baby will inevitably be a Ping'er!" After saying this, she wailed loudly. The husband understood her worries but didn't know how to comfort her. After anxiously waiting for a long time, he leaned close to the wife's ear and whispered, "What are you afraid of? In the event, in the event... I just won't remarry."</p>
<p>It's not known whether the wife actually heard these words because she didn't express anything and from then on entered a state of unconsciousness. At dawn, the husband still wanted to go to school, but he really couldn't separate himself, so he had to ask someone to tell the school and stayed by his wife's side all day. Some kind-hearted neighbors, hearing that the wife was critically ill, came to visit and help. In the evening, the wife passed away. Because she had been unconscious for a long time, she didn't leave any last words. The child didn't understand and thought that her mother was asleep and ignoring her, so she kept crying for her mother to hold her. After the funeral, she didn't see her mother come back and cried every day, asking her father to bring her back. Everyone said that the husband should remarry as soon as possible, but because the husband had promised his wife not to remarry, he refused to break his promise. When someone tried to set him up with a match, he declined, saying, "What wrong did the dead have against me? She only just stopped breathing, how can I bear to take another person!" He didn't dare to tell people about his determination to keep his promise and not remarry, because he was afraid people would laugh at him.</p>
<p>After a few days, the husband went to school to teach, but he couldn't leave the child, so he took her along. At school, the child kept crying about wanting to go home to find her mother, which made everyone uncomfortable. Some students who didn't have mothers were holding back their tears. After struggling for a few days, other troubles came. The husband was lecturing and explaining rituals, but the child sitting next to him became impatient. She would either cry to defecate or urinate, or she would doze off and fall to the ground. The husband valued dignity the most when it came to his students and couldn't bear such embarrassing things. The next day, he had no choice but to lock the child at home and no longer take her to the school. But when he came home from school, the child had cried until she was hoarse and didn't even recognize her father. He was very sad. After thinking it over, he couldn't find a way to properly place the child, so he had to listen to others and remarry. He consoled himself, saying, "Not wanting to remarry is for the sake of the child; today, wanting to remarry is also for the sake of the child. I think I can be worthy of the deceased, right?"</p>
<p>He was afraid that people would mistreat his child, so he searched everywhere for a virtuous woman. He didn't care about anything else, only virtue was his sole requirement. As a result, he found a woman who he thought fit his ideal. This woman was older and ugly. Because she didn't have any brothers, she had to farm herself to support her elderly parents, so she couldn't get married in time. Now that her elderly parents had just died, she was worried that she had a full belly of enthusiasm but nowhere to place it. She and the husband were from the same village and knew that he was a loyal and kind person, so when someone proposed a match to her, she agreed.</p>
<p>On the night the wife came to the house, after she had just removed her makeup, the husband led his child with tears in his eyes to pay respects to her stepmother. He deceived the child, saying, "Chu'er, aren't you always asking me for your mother? Now that mother has come back, why aren't you going to find her?" The child was very happy. She followed her father, shouting "Mother." Unexpectedly, when she arrived at the new house, she only saw a stranger sitting there. The child immediately became frightened and turned to leave. The husband quickly stopped her and said, "It's mother, good child, come, call her mother!" The child struggled to get out, crying, "I want to find my mother, this isn't my mother, I want to find my mother!" The husband had no choice but to carry her out.</p>
<p>When the husband went to bring the child in, the wife had prepared a pile of candy in the house for the child to eat. She was determined to be a good stepmother but didn't expect the child to refuse to recognize her at first sight, which disappointed her. She couldn't help but remember what her sister had said. The day before she got married, her sister told her, "Sister, I am a stepmother (her sister was also married to a widower), and I know what it's like to be a stepmother. Even if you cut out your heart and liver for the children of the previous marriage, they will treat it like dog lungs. Everyone thinks that there isn't a good stepmother. Even if you are a good person, you will be wronged." At that time, she didn't believe her sister's words. She always thought that if you treat the children of the previous marriage with a mother's heart, they will treat you like their own mother. Now that she saw even a small girl being so disgusted with stepmothers, she felt that her sister's words seemed to make sense. However, she still refused to be discouraged. She said, "Why must people treat you well, it's enough to treat people well yourself." After a while, she laughed at herself again and said, "She's just a child, what does she know? I'm being serious, what a fool!"</p>
<p>The wife tried her best to please the child. In less than ten days, the child became very familiar with her. The child now naturally called her "Mother" without being taught. She was very obedient. Whatever the stepmother told her to do, she would do it. Unlike when her own mother was still alive, she didn't act spoiled or stubborn so easily. She sometimes had to look at her stepmother's face, and without her stepmother saying anything, she would do things that pleased her. If someone asked her, "Who gave birth to you?" she would point to her stepmother and say, "It's mother." If someone asked her, "Who do you love the most?" she would point to her stepmother and say, "I love mother the most." If someone asked her, "Who is the prettiest?" she would point to her stepmother and say, "Mother is the prettiest." But when she was alone with her father, she would ask him with tears in her eyes, "Won't Mother (this, of course, refers to her own mother) come back? Will Mother still come back?" The father was sad for a while before replying, "Isn't Mother already back? She's with you every day, don't you recognize her?" The child didn't say anything. She was very disappointed and quietly slipped into the old house where her mother used to live. She pushed aside the heavy spiderwebs, sat on a small chair covered in dust, and looked at the old wooden bed filled with broken things, saying, "Baby won't be naughty anymore, Mother, get up, give baby a piece of candy." Immediately, she pretended to be her mother, changing her tone and saying, "Good baby, good乖乖, Mother will get up, I'll give you all the candy." At that time, the father had quietly followed and entered. When he saw this situation, he quickly picked up the child and couldn't help but feel sad and cry. The child was momentarily confused and thought her real mother had come home, and she cried and laughed, shouting "Mother" non-stop.</p>
<p>At that time, the stepmother was in the kitchen preparing food. When she heard the crying, she hurried out. When the child saw her stepmother, she became frightened and immediately regained her senses. The wife's nerves became oversensitive at this time, and she guessed the wrong thing. She didn't say anything and angrily ran back to the kitchen. While chopping vegetables, she muttered, "Alas! It's really a silent dog that bites people to death! Seeing that he doesn't make a sound, I always thought that he was quite satisfied with me, but who knew that he was harboring such a ghost! Have I mistreated his ex-wife's daughter in any way? Is it worth it for the father and daughter to hide in the dead person's house crying for their mother!" Now she thought of her sister's words again: "Everyone thinks that there isn't a good stepmother, even if you are a good person, you will be wronged." But she was a stubborn person and refused to admit defeat so easily. Although she was very sad, she still said, "Why must people treat you well, it's enough to treat people well yourself." She prepared the food and brought it out to eat, chatting and laughing as usual, pretending that she didn't mind at all.</p>
<p>From then on, the wife treated the child even more politely, giving her the best things in the house to eat and wear. Even if she did something wrong, she never said a word to her. Now that the stepmother treated her this way, it was reasonable that she should love her stepmother very much and live happily. But she was really strange. She was afraid when she saw her stepmother and was cautious all day long, without any childlike innocence or liveliness. Only when her father went to school and her stepmother went to the kitchen did she feel the freest and happiest. When she turned around and there was no one, she would push open the door of the main room and happily jump down the steps. When she ran out of the courtyard alone, she would usually sit on a small stone under the jujube tree, holding a large stone in front of the small stone with both hands, tilting her head and looking at the blue sky, wondering. The hot little jujubes fell from the tree to her side, but she was too lazy to pick them up and eat them. She now knew that her mother had not left and was not coming back; she was already dead. As for what death was all about, she certainly didn't know. However, she knew that death was equivalent to a person being hidden away forever, never being able to be with loved ones again, so she was very sad when she thought about her mother being dead. She still clearly remembered what her mother was like. Before her mother died, the two of them would often sit on two stones under the jujube tree. Her mother would peel jujubes for her to eat, and she would sing songs for her mother to listen to. When the moon came up, her father would be correcting papers under the lamp in the house, and she and her mother would still come out to the courtyard to enjoy the cool air. Although she sat very low, because her mother kept fanning her, not even a mosquito dared to bite her. She loved the moon and even more loved her mother's face. She would look at the moon, jump up and touch her mother's face, waving her arms and legs, so happy she wanted to fall down. This kind of feeling, truly, the sweetness of the jujube was not enough to describe it, the fragrance of the flower was not enough to describe it!</p>
<p>Her mother died, and this kind of feeling was over. Although she didn't lack clothes to wear or food to eat, she didn't know what the meaning of eating and wearing was. What she needed was deep enthusiasm and meticulous attention. Only her mother could give her these things. She had also tried to find some of her mother's good qualities in her stepmother, but she was completely disappointed. The more she missed her mother's love, the more afraid she was of her stepmother's strictness. This kind of strictness was made up of "power of control" and "negligence." Because the stepmother had the right to control everything about the child and was too lazy to care for her, the child therefore "respected and kept her distance" from the stepmother. The wife knew that the child wasn't close to her, but she didn't know the reason why. She only thought that this was the usual behavior of the children of a previous marriage towards a stepmother, so she didn't take it to heart.</p>
<p>When Achu was seven years old, the wife gave birth to a baby boy. The wife was determined to be a good stepmother, so she was very careful to avoid discriminating against the two children. She always deliberately tried to treat Achu better. For example, when dividing oranges, she would definitely find a big one for Achu and a small one for her own son. But strangely enough, no matter what, Achu was unwilling (perhaps afraid) to accept such preferential treatment. She would always secretly exchange it with her younger brother, taking a smaller one.</p>
<p>One day, Achu got sick. The wife got up several times at night to check on her, but she fell asleep as soon as she returned to bed. Not long after Achu recovered, the wife's son got sick. The wife didn't get up at night to check on him, but she was worried about his illness all night and couldn't fall asleep. It was while tossing and turning and unable to sleep that she figured out the reason. She thought, "No wonder my son is close to me and Achu isn't close to me. It turns out that I really love my own son more than I love her. When Achu is sick, I can sleep, but when my son is sick, I can't sleep. This is the proof. But this is natural instinct, how can I change it?" She thought for a long time and suddenly understood, saying, "Everything I've done in the past has been too pretentious. Because I was afraid people would say I wasn't good, everything I did was just for show. How could that be how a mother treats her child? I must change now, be realistic, truly treat her with a mother's heart, think of her in everything, and not seek for people to say good things about me."</p>
<p>The wife was indeed a person who was brave enough to change her ways. The next day, she changed her attitude. In the past, she didn't like people mentioning Achu's real mother the most. Even if Achu and her father sat together for a little longer, she would try to call them away, so they wouldn't talk about the past. Now that the wife knew that Achu was still remembering her real mother, she often talked to her about her real mother. She specially asked a calligrapher to write a memorial tablet for the deceased and organized all the things she had used during her lifetime, displaying them in the room where she died. When the weather was good, the wife often took Achu to visit the grave. When Achu cried for her mother, the wife wiped away her tears and comforted her kindly. Because Achu received the stepmother's consideration in everything and had the opportunity to freely express her feelings, she gradually became innocent and lively, not depressed, and didn't think about her mother all the time. She knew that her stepmother was treating her with sincerity, and her heart unknowingly turned towards her mother.</p>
<p>When Achu was thirteen years old, the villagers said that Achu's father was virtuous and recommended him, and the court appointed him as the magistrate of Zhuyai. Unexpectedly, he couldn't adapt to the local climate and died of illness three months after taking office. Achu, her mother, and her younger brother sorrowfully escorted the coffin back to their hometown. The people of Zhuyai, grateful for the husband's goodness, many people wore white clothes to see him off, and they refused to turn back when they reached the border.</p>
<p>Zhuyai was a place where pearls were produced. The government had established a law that anyone who secretly brought pearls into the country would be sentenced to death. The wife had a pearl bracelet. She knew that she couldn't take it out of the country, so she hurriedly threw it on the ground when she was about to leave. Unexpectedly, her son didn't understand and picked it up, secretly hiding it in his mother's jewelry case. When passing through the border, the border official searched it out, took the evidence, and publicly declared, "Who is the one who has broken the law and deserves to die? Speak up quickly." Achu thought that it must have been her stepmother who carelessly caused the disaster. She remembered how good her stepmother had been to her and wanted to take this opportunity to die for her to repay her. She quickly stepped forward and said to the border official, "I am the one who broke the law. This pearl bracelet belongs to my mother. My mother threw it away when she was about to leave. I couldn't bear to pick it up and put it in my mother's jewelry case. I didn't expect it to be found." When the wife heard Achu's words, she also thought that it was her daughter who had broken the law, but she couldn't bear to let her daughter die. At the same time, she thought that she wouldn't have put the pearl bracelet in a good place, it was her own fault, and she couldn't let her daughter take the blame for her. She also quickly stepped forward and explained to the border official, "I am the one who broke the law, it has nothing to do with my daughter. Because I was heartbroken and busy, I forgot to take out the pearl bracelet in the jewelry case when I was about to leave. My daughter couldn't bear to see me suffer the death penalty, so she would rather die for me, so she falsely claimed this crime." Achu cried, "It was really me who did it. Mother loves me and can't bear to see me suffer the death penalty, so she wants to take my place." The mother and daughter both vied to die. The border official and the people who were seeing them off were all moved to tears. The border official didn't want to kill good people, so he had no choice but to let both the mother and daughter enter the country.</p>
<p>When Achu and her mother confessed, Achu's younger brother pulled on his mother and sister's sleeves, crying wildly. He seemed to have something to say, but no one paid attention to him. By the time they entered the country, he was still crying wildly. The mother and sister came over to comfort him, and he finally had the opportunity to tell them about hiding the pearl. Everyone knew that Achu and her mother were both people who hadn't committed a crime but were brave enough to die for righteousness, so they called them the Two Acts of Righteousness in Zhuyai.</p>

<p>Waste Utilization of Tooth Powder Bags.  The Hua Nan Industrial Society, located at 15 Ningbo Road, French Concession, is famous for manufacturing cosmetics. Since its reorganization, it has hired several tooth powder manufacturing experts to modify the original Butterfly Facial Tooth Powder using the latest scientific methods. They also invited doctors with rich experience in beauty and dentistry to carefully research the ingredients and their functions. The aim is to ensure that the facial powder can whiten the skin and the tooth powder can whiten teeth, kill cavities, and not damage the skin or gums. The society first had its own family members try it out to prove its effectiveness before daring to introduce it to the world. To save users money, the outer bag of the tooth powder is packaged in the shape of an envelope. Although the amount of paper used is one-third more than before, which increases the cost, the society is willing to sacrifice this in order to promote sales. The selling price is still the same as ordinary tooth powder. This type of tooth powder bag is considered waste by buyers, but now that it has been changed to an envelope shape, it can be saved for sending letters. Its value is estimated to be at least two cents. However, each package of Butterfly Facial Tooth Powder costs only two national currency cents. Therefore, this envelope-style powder bag is entirely a free gift to reward buyers.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Shen Bao Newspaper,</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding a news item recently published in your newspaper concerning a lawsuit between our school and the Mu Shi Night School. This report is inaccurate. The Xu Mu Shi in question is Xu Lin-shu, also known as Chu Lin-shu. In 1930, he studied typing in the typing department of our school, as evidenced by his personally filled-out application form. He was then promoted to assistant teacher at our school and later resigned for personal reasons. Afterwards, this Xu Mu Shi enticed students from our school to open the Mu Shi Night School. Unexpectedly, in October of this year, Xu Mu Shi filed a lawsuit with the Social Bureau and the local court, using a forged diploma from the Zhenhua Typing School and denying that he was a student of our school. After our school presented various certificates and witnesses, the case was dismissed. This Xu Mu Shi, without any sense of shame, continued to forge documents and filed a complaint with the prosecutor's office, which was also rejected. We respectfully request that your esteemed newspaper uphold justice and publish this letter to correct the record.</p>
<p>With sincere gratitude,</p>
<p>Fan Ren-cai, Principal of Wu Shi Advanced Commercial English Tutoring School</p>

<h3>"The Story of Money" (Part II)</h3>
<p>—Yu Po</p>
<p>—Commercial Press—</p>
<p>He gave a twofold explanation of the meaning of money, giving us a reasonable understanding of the myriad forms of money.</p>
<p>Following the definition, he began to describe the earliest forms of money. He said that the earliest money in the world was seashells, because seashells were ornaments and therefore could be used as money. In addition to seashells, there were also stone coins, fish teeth, animal teeth, woodpecker feathers, livestock, and tobacco, all of which could be used as a medium of exchange. Strangely, even huge stone wheels could be used as money and enjoyed a high degree of credit. Finally, he also discussed the origin of Chinese currency, from knife money and cloth money to copper coins with holes, and finally evolving into round coins. He also discussed the leather coins that were popular during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. His conclusion was that these earliest forms of money were products of civilization from thousands of years ago, but some modern, barbaric peoples still use them. His storytelling approach to explaining the earliest forms of money and their evolutionary path is quite interesting for readers who lack economic knowledge.</p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at the chapter "Usury - The Church and the Jews." At the beginning of the chapter, the author explains the meaning and origin of interest, and then describes the attacks by ancient politicians and religious figures on the interest generated by borrowing, viewing lending at interest as the most immoral, cruel, and inhuman act, and viewing lenders as vermin of mankind. Then, he explains that the Jews had already taken the reins of European finance by 60 BC and began to engage in the business of lending at interest. He said:</p>
<p>William wanted to reform this financial system and establish it on the basis of currency, without using or citing the Jews. This would allow him to obtain cash from the Jews when collecting taxes in kind. At the same time, taxpayers who only had goods and no cash could also borrow cash from the Jews to pay taxes. (See page 193)</p>
<p>Finally, he pointed out that under the modern economic system, lending at interest has gradually become a legal matter. This is because the current social system is built on the foundation of gold. His sociological examination of the issue of usury based on historical facts is noteworthy.</p>
<p>In short, this "Story of Money" has six advantages: ㊀ extensive research and citations; ㊁ simple and easy-to-understand language; ㊂ correct insights; ㊃ uses both essay and story styles; ㊄ each chapter has a summary at the beginning; ㊅ can be used as a history of money and common economic knowledge. If the author could include illustrations and photographs of various currencies, this book would be even more perfect. (End)</p>
<h3>Childhood Lives of Foreign Celebrities</h3>
<p>— Jiang Si</p>
<p>Edited by Shen Zishan and Shen Shoubi, Commercial Press</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic children's literature has seen new developments, which is a common fact. Adults are trying all sorts of ways to create an environment for children to develop healthy bodies and minds, whether in school education or social education. Naturally, the publishing industry's concern for children has become even more pronounced in recent years.</p>
<p>The climax of the publishing industry's special attention to children's literature was often in the past year. No matter which bookstore, they had to think and plan with children in mind. On the one hand, it was the speculation of merchants, but on the other hand, it was also the main reason due to the demands of the times and the needs of children. Although this climax has gradually decreased in recent years, it is still common to see several larger bookstores continuing to publish this type of book.</p>
<p>Recently, I bought a copy of "Childhood Lives of Foreign Celebrities" compiled by Shen Zishan and Shen Shoubi at the Commercial Press, and I found it very interesting. I quickly finished reading it. For childhood, I think everyone has to feel that it is precious and cannot be returned. Of course, children need us to use the enthusiasm and valuable insights of adult memories to imply and stimulate them as much as possible. Moreover, because children need to be instilled with new vitality and a new ideal personality during their school years, we have to seize this period and use their hearts, which have not been tainted by the corrupt society, to provide enlightenment. For this, it is certainly urgent and appropriate for children to have a comparison with the childhoods of foreign celebrities. The Commercial Press's publication of this book must also have this intention.</p>
<p>The title of the book is "Childhood Lives of Foreign Celebrities," and its theme is naturally a narrative of the childhoods of celebrities. In the book, a total of twenty-one celebrities are included, and these people are certainly not strangers to us. Analyzing these celebrities, we can get the following concept: there are two writers, Shakespeare and Goethe; there are about eight or nine scientists, Edison, Newton, Franklin, Watt, Faraday, Darwin, etc.; there are also five politicians, such as Garibaldi, Lincoln, Wilson, Bismarck, etc.; great generals such as Hindenburg, etc.; and educator Froebel. A major tendency here is to favor scientists, which is an excellent hint. The editors have also done their best to write in a clean and clear style in the text, so that children do not feel bored.</p>
<p>However, within these advantages, I have also found points that make people think that they cannot be strongly emphasized. First of all, what readers feel is that twenty-one foreign celebrities are used to represent, which I think is not enough, whether divided by country or by era. Here, we deeply feel the lack of material. Chinese celebrities who have a place in international or historical terms have long been abandoned due to the limitations of the book's title, but there are many foreign celebrities who are just as valuable and prestigious as these twenty-one, or even higher, who are not included in the selection. These regrets should be compensated for. Secondly, I also feel that the childhood lives of figures in our current world are lacking, which makes children temporarily immersed in the figures of the past history, which should give a very bad impression.</p>
<p>Evaluating this booklet from a holistic point of view, I also have to say that its narrative should be based on cleanliness and simplicity, but for this kind of subject matter, it is best to make it as interesting as possible and use a pure literary style to express and inspire it. This way, the childhood lives of great people, great figures from various eras and countries, can be made into stories and made interesting. This is much better than this simple and dull booklet.</p>
<p>Here, I sincerely pray for a booklet of ideal and complete childhood lives of celebrities from all over the world to appear for the tens of millions of children!</p>
<h3>Review of the Techniques of "Gift-Giving"</h3>
<p>— Wan Shilan</p>
<p>——A creative work in the New Year's issue of Oriental Magazine——</p>
<p>In the turbulent Chinese literary scene, the talents of all writers have been completely drowned out by people who attempt to use literature as a means to achieve certain desires. As a result, a lot of time is wasted in vain, and genuine works are often rushed to sell by writers and lack the honing of a longer period of time. It is inevitable that young people who eagerly hope to read good books feel disappointed. The so-called garden of art is always a stone field that does not produce fruit, a desert that does not grow good trees and flowers.</p>
<p>Recently, in the New Year's issue of Oriental Magazine, I read Wang Pingling's recent work "Gift-Giving", which made me as happy as a traveler who had been hungry and thirsty for a long time suddenly getting sweet nectar. I read it very smoothly. A medium-length story with about 20,000 words did not encounter any obstacles, forcing me to abandon the book in the middle and sigh. Instead, every section and every paragraph of the plot had a novel interest, enticing me to finish reading it effortlessly. This can be said to be a rare miracle discovered in the modern Chinese literary scene!</p>
<p>The plot of the story describes an accounting section chief who has maintained his position through four successive political changes. In the fourth change, he encounters a bureau chief who is determined to reform the legal system. However, the accounting section chief does not hesitate to sell his entire personality like an old official in an auction house - and tries every means to get close to the bureau chief and win the trust of his relatives. In the end, the bureau chief's good intentions to reform politics are blocked by soft constraints and cannot be realized. And our accounting section chief is still "doing well" in the fourth change. The twists and turns of this story, as well as the personalities of the various characters that appear in this story, are vividly swayed before our eyes by the author's most concise and vicious pen. Moreover, every action of the characters can make the reader guess the protagonist's psychology at the same time, and at the same time understand what tricks the people around the protagonist are playing in the environment. This kind of technique is the use of Montage technique in movies, which is three-dimensional, not half-baked. It is a way of analyzing psychology through actions, not a straightforward explanation and a boring narrative. "Gift-Giving" is indeed a new trend in the Chinese literary scene in terms of writing skills. Using Montage techniques to deal with the subject matter of works is indeed a task that writers urgently need to learn.</p>

<h3>"The Guangdong Spirit"</h3>
<p>—Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Recently, many Japanese people, especially those who have traveled in China or worked as diplomats in China, have gradually gained a new understanding of our country. Except for some Japanese people who say that China is a "bandit country," most of them can see that the current China is no longer the China of the past. The China of the past was often called "the old, big China," while the current China is "the new China" and "the young China." Therefore, when everyone discusses Sino-Japanese relations, their conclusion is always to call on their own people to re-evaluate China and change their foreign policy. Recently, Mr. Suma, the Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, was transferred back to his country. In an interview with Japanese reporters, he said: "I have been in China for eleven years. During this time, the changes in China have been as激like raging waves. What I feel most acutely is that the 'Guangdong Spirit' is the center of the National Government and is spreading throughout the country. The characteristics of the Guangdong Spirit are an indomitable soul and the restoration of national rights."</p>
<p>Mr. Suma's criticism of China can be said to be pertinent. It is a conclusion he has drawn from eleven years of observation in China. The progress of China in recent years is precisely the development of this "Guangdong Spirit." Not only has China been like this for eleven years, but this spirit has already been launched since the occurrence of the revolutionary movement. We succeeded in the Xinhai Revolution by relying on this spirit, and we also succeeded in the Northern Era by relying on this spirit. As for the recent response to difficulties, the current completion of unification, and the victory of the Sui War, all are the power of this spirit. Moreover, this "indomitable soul" is, as Mr. Suma said, "deepening and expanding year by year" and will "gradually become stronger" in the future. To sum up in one sentence, the future revival of China must rely on this "Guangdong Spirit" to promote it. This is our Chinese people's self-confidence. No matter how great the difficulties we encounter, we must overcome them with this spirit so that the country can escape from danger and advance on the broad road of national revival.</p>
<p>Finally, I think that Mr. Suma said "Guangdong Spirit" probably because Guangdong is the birthplace of the Chinese revolution, and most of the important people in our government are from Guangdong, so he used the word "Guangdong" to represent it. In fact, this "indomitable soul" has developed to this day and has become a common phenomenon throughout the country. It can be called "the spirit of the Chinese nation." How to develop our spirit, this is what every Chinese person should strive to do.</p>
<h3>Healthy and Beautiful Women</h3>
<p>—Ming Mei</p>
<p>Healthy and beautiful women can often arouse people's admiration and respect.</p>
<p>But to become a healthy and beautiful woman, she is not born healthy and beautiful. She must cultivate and temper herself at all times, and she must overcome the diseases in her body at all times...</p>
<p>For example, if she suffers from dysmenorrhea or has scanty menstruation, she should buy the wonderful medicine "Monthly Red" to promote menstruation and activate blood circulation. If she suffers from physical weakness and blood deficiency, or has irregular menstruation, she should buy the tonic "Women's Treasure" to nourish yin and replenish deficiency. In this way, it is not difficult to become a healthy and beautiful woman.</p>
<p>"Monthly Red" and "Women's Treasure" are both products of Wuzhou Drugstore, which have always been supported by female compatriots. You can understand by looking at the picture above.</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching "Sunrise"</h3>
<p>—Li Yi</p>
<p>Performed by the Drama Workshop at the Carlton</p>
<p>Compared with "Thunderstorm", "Sunrise", apart from the structure, surpasses "Thunderstorm" in all aspects. The fate theory of "Thunderstorm" is too heavy, and the characters in it are all gloomy. Even Zhou Chong, who wants to fly to the new world, is only innocent and too soft. He has a good soul, but he has not experienced storms. As for Fang Dasheng here, his simple so-called "fool" temperament is the same as Zhou Chong, but he is much more experienced. He saw a group of people being deceived and humiliated, but he also saw a new group, like the group of workers singing earthwork songs and patiently laying the foundation. Moreover, he is not just an onlooker. He wants to fight Jin Bafu, and he wants Bai Lu to go with him. As a result, even if Bai Lu does not go, he also walks away with his head held high.</p>
<p>This is a gratifying progress.</p>
<p>The author likes to use symbols to express his theme. He repeatedly proposes that the sun rises and the darkness remains behind. But the sun is not ours, we are going to sleep. At the end, he also ends with the workers' "loud and majestic" axle song, the sunlight outside the house and the darkness inside the house. Such an ending is naturally deeply meaningful to intellectual audiences, but can the general audience understand it? This is worth discussing. "I saw a new heaven and a new earth, because the former heaven and earth have passed away" (the preface excerpted by the author before the play). Compared to "Thunderstorm", the author "saw a new heaven and a new earth". I hope and bless that he can go further like Fang Dasheng in "Sunrise" and fight against the evil forces.</p>
<p>Mr. Mao Dun criticized "Sunrise" and said: "This is an epitome of semi-colonial financial capital." Because of this writing, I was reminded of Mr. Mao Dun's "Midnight." Yes, "Sunrise", just like "Midnight", has cut a very accurate shadow for this semi-colonial financial capital (I remember that "Midnight" also involved national capital). Not only are the themes and materials somewhat similar, but the characters' personalities are also somewhat similar. I can't remember the names of the characters in "Midnight", but when I saw Pan Yuetai and Li Shiqing here, I immediately thought of "Midnight".</p>
<h3>A Group of Devils in ‘Sunrise’</h3>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>That entrepreneur in “Midnight” and his subordinates who put in great effort during the strike wave. Of course, this is not to say that “Sunrise” plagiarized “Midnight,” nor that the characters in “Sunrise” were copied from “Midnight.” I just want to say that they have some similarities. In any case, works expressed in two different ways, even if there are some coincidences, do not detract from their artistic or social value.</p>
<p>Of course, “Sunrise” also has differences from “Midnight.” I remember that “Midnight” mentioned the forces behind the financial capitalists, while “Sunrise” did not. Fang Dasheng is going to fight countless Jin Bas. When he fights, he will naturally discover that behind the countless Jin Bas there is a larger supporter. But before he fights, the author did not tell the audience about the forces behind Jin Ba within the possible range, which cannot but be considered a regret.</p>
<p>The “Sunrise” performed by the Drama Workshop was directed by Mr. Ouyang Yuqian after being revised and agreed upon by the original author. Most notably, the third act was deleted. As for the other acts, because I haven't reread the script, I can't remember. I glanced over the ending of the fourth act and learned that A Gen (changed to A Fu on stage) was taken away, and Bai Lu's suicide was also moved to a different room. From this, one can infer that there were probably quite a few other changes as well, right?</p>
<p>Somehow, the impression “Sunrise” gave me on stage was not as good as when I read the script. I thought about this carefully and felt that the reason was probably because the performance was too relaxed, so it wasn't as tense as when I read it in one breath. For example, the appearance of the pitiful clerk Huang Sheng San was much more tense when I read it than when I watched it. (Of course, this cannot be entirely blamed on the actors.) Also, when reading the script, it is not easy to feel whether the play is dull or not, but it is different when watching it. Is "Sunrise" also like this? I don't think so, because what I felt here was not dullness, but relaxation. Although the problem of relaxation may also be in the script, for example, there are too many characters, and the development of the main line is hindered by interjections, etc., the lack of atmosphere is probably the responsibility of the director.</p>
<p>The lack of atmosphere and the actors’ unfamiliarity with the lines and effects are probably not without reason. I watched the first performance and heard cues from behind the stage several times while sitting in the balcony. And once, the actors were embarrassed on stage for a while because they were waiting for the phone to ring. All of these things made the atmosphere dissipate. Naturally, becoming proficient in the performance can make up for these shortcomings, but putting on a performance without rehearsing it thoroughly is too dangerous.</p>
<p>As for the actors' acting skills, I really liked Ms. Feng Zi's Chen Bailu and Gao Buxiao's A Gen. Ms. Feng Zi's character was consistent between the first and second acts, but in the third act, she seemed to have changed a bit. I thought she was too silent. Gao Buxiao's A Gen, however, gave me an unexpectedly good impression. Others, such as Cui Shiji's Pan Yueting, Ding Boliu's Fang Dasheng, Su Ling's Xiao Dongxi, Gongsun Min's Huang Shengsan, and Mo Yan's Li Shiqing, all gave me very good impressions. As for Wu Tieyi's Zhang Qiaozhi, I thought he was too fiery. Dai Lisha's Aunt Gu Ba and Li Xianjing's Hu Si were not quite enough. This may be because I had too deep an impression of these three characters when I read the script. Once they were brought to the stage, they didn't match the characters I had imagined, so I was dissatisfied.</p>
<p>The set was divided into two sections. I didn't think it was very good, and it even seemed a bit unreal. The breaks between acts were too long, even for a single scene. This time was wasted a bit too much. The lighting was also not good. The lack of a light source was one reason, and the sudden changes between bright and dark were also too difficult. When I read the script, when I read the last paragraph:</p>
<p>The pile-driving workers sang the pile-driving song in high-pitched and majestic unison (namely, "Sunrise in the east, the sky is red, to eat, you have to work"). The heavy stone pestle fell into the soil one after another. The sound transmitted to the audience's ears was a great life pushing forward, advancing forward, overflowing and filling the universe.</p>
<p>I thought that this effect would definitely make the play more outstanding and highlight the author's meaning, but this time it was done too badly. It was neither majestic enough nor clear enough. As a result, the power of that great life was completely lost. I hope that in the following performances, it can be enriched.</p>
<h3>Night on Yangma Island</h3>
<p>— Richness</p>
<p>Life passed by so comfortably and peacefully. Gradually, everyone got tired of this ordinary life! Everyone wanted to adjust it a little, at least to make life a little more eventful, otherwise, it would turn people into a piece of wood.</p>
<p>One night, an order came down! We were ordered to sail our small fleet to the Bohai Sea to work on anti-smuggling missions in the Yantai and Longkou areas! That night, the captain and the lieutenant gave us instructions. Beautiful flowers bloomed in the hearts of every brother. This was not leaving the current sea to go to the Bohai Sea to change the air, but to resist enemies and traitors—the great anti-smuggling work! Happy and excited, every brother was full of energy. No one slept that night. Gunner Li Geng was singing 'Eighteen Touches' softly in his bed. Xiao Shuanzi sat on his bunk wiping his gun, muttering to himself from time to time. Judging from his expression, he had already made up his mind to kill the enemy!</p>
<p>When the red sun leaped from the east, the 'Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth' flag rose high in the sky in the tragic military music, reflecting each other with the sun. The whistle roared, and the chimney drew a huge line in the long sky. In this way, I joyfully left the outer harbor of 'Liugong Island' and advanced towards the Bohai Sea!</p>
<p>The warship stopped between 'Qiandao Island' and 'Zhifu Island.' It was said that smuggling ships often passed through this route. The anchor was dropped and vigilance began. The captain, the colonel, and the gunner Xiao Guan were all looking around with binoculars on the observation deck.</p>
<p>The radio operator urgently reported that an enemy smuggling ship was discovered on the sea off 'Yangma Island.' The captain immediately ordered to raise the anchor and sail to 'Yangma Island.'</p>
<p>At sunset, our warship sailed to the sea off 'Yangma Island.' We were out of luck! There was no sign of the enemy's smuggling ship. We communicated with the local official agencies on land, and they also said that they had not seen any. Yesterday, a Chinese ship loaded with smuggled goods docked here, but because it was protected by ×× people, the local authorities could not do anything about it. The brothers were angry! Cursing!</p>
<p>The boundless sea had already fallen into a deep darkness. There was no moon in the sky, and sparse stars winked, as if mocking our weakness and incompetence! Fresh air permeated the sea. The vast ocean, stretching for thousands of miles, was calm and waveless. The moving scenery, like a magician, was displaying its mysterious skills there. This was different from the night scene of 'Liugong Island' harbor. The fresh air allowed you to breathe freely, and you couldn't help but feel happy in your spirit and no longer wanted to sleep. However, the night sea, with such a great view, seemed extremely sleepy and slept quietly and steadily. At this time, all was silent, and only the sound of waves slowly flowing could be heard. It spit out the most peaceful and lovely waves, constantly gently kissing our ship's side.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, a cargo ship was discovered sailing towards "Yangma Island." The captain ordered the ship to be intercepted. After shining the searchlight three times on the cargo ship that was moving, unexpectedly, the ship fired a row of shots. In the darkness, and at a great distance, it was not known whether they were aiming at us. At this moment, gunner Li Geng wanted to open fire, but the order was not to allow it.</p>
<p>The cargo ship turned around and sailed away. This was obviously a smuggling ship! In principle, we should have chased after it, but the captain ordered to drop anchor here. He said, 'It's better to do less than to do more.' It's not our responsibility if they don't land here!</p>
<p>The sea was sleeping soundly, and the stars glared at our warship.</p>
<p>Just as dawn broke, the radio received a report from Longkou: 'A smuggling ship has arrived here and unloaded five hundred bags of sugar, three hundred and fifty pieces of rayon, and one hundred and eighty boxes of porcelain.'</p>
<p>Our warship was stationed on 'Yangma Island.' The captain still adhered to the principle of 'It's better to do less than to do more' and ordered us to carry out anti-smuggling missions on the sea off this small island.</p>

<h3>Completion of "Gate of Flesh and Spirit"</h3>
<p>"Gate of Flesh and Spirit," a unique creation in the Chinese film industry, has recently completed filming. It is the latest script by Zhong Shigen, the author of Humanity, City Night, Life, and Family Ethics, and is co-directed by Zhong himself and the newcomer Zhao Ce.</p>
<p>In addition to Lin Chuchu and Li Keng, a mother and son duo, Xiao Ying, Ge Zaozhi, Wen Rong, Wang Guilin, Gong Zhihua, and many others have been specially hired to play the main roles. The famous photographer Zhuang Guojun has been invited to be in charge of the film's photography. The set designer Zhao Fuli and various other staff members are also well-known figures, which further enhances the film's reputation.</p>
<p>"Gate of Flesh and Spirit" is extremely mysterious, suspenseful, tortuous, and bizarre. Its great and solemn significance and sacred spirit are unparalleled in any film.

<p>"Receiving the God of Wealth" (3 Men On A Horse) is originally a famous stage comedy popular in Europe and America. It has been staged on Broadway for more than two years, and the box office is still very crowded, which shows that the play is indeed attractive. Warner Bros. has now brought the play to the screen to introduce it to movie fans all over the world, and Melvin Leroy, the great director of "Outlaw," has been appointed to direct the film. Warner Bros.'s emphasis on this film is evident here. The content is very rich in jokes, and witty remarks can be picked up everywhere. It is a comedy that has not been seen on the screen for ten years. The protagonists are Frank McHugh and Joan Blondell, one being silly and the other being idiotic, their performances are lifelike and hilarious. The film will be released at the Cathay Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre starting today.</p>

<h3>Qianjiang Capsizing Tragedy</h3>
<p>The Qianjiang Railway Bridge is one of our country's great engineering projects. Recently, due to the approaching deadline, work was carried out day and night. Unfortunately, at midnight on the 24th of last month, the small boat transporting bridge workers suddenly capsized due to negligence. It was late at night, and rescue was not possible in time, resulting in the drowning of more than 100 workers in the river. The tragedy was unbearable to hear. This is a part of the corpses recovered at the shore the next day.</p>

<h3>The Great Disaster of the Burning Train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway</h3>
<p>On the 16th of last month, the midday express train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, traveling from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, suddenly caught fire near Shitan due to explosives carried by passengers in the train being shaken. The train continued to move forward, causing a major disaster in which the train was burned. A total of three third-class passenger cars were burned, killing more than 80 passengers, and even more were injured. The circle is the remains of those who were burned to death.</p>

<h3>One of the Scenes from "Demon of Desire"</h3>
<p>— (Yang Jiming Photo)</p>
<p>After performing "Nora" and "The Inspector General," Shanghai amateur actors recently made their third public performance at the Carlton Theatre. The plays performed were Tolstoy's original work, Ouyang Yuqian's translation and adaptation of "The Power of Darkness" (renamed "Demon of Desire"), Ostrovsky's "Thunderstorm," and Oakse's original work, Shen Xiling and Song Zhi's translation and adaptation of "Shunov and Peacock" (renamed "Living in a Dream"). These are all world-famous plays. The appropriate allocation of actors, the artistic nature of the set design, the sound effects, and the harmony of the lighting are more advanced than the previous two performances. The popularity of ticket sales is no less than that of the Forties Drama Society's performance of "Sai Jinhua." As a prelude to the drama movement in 1937, this achievement is, of course, a joyful message that gives great excitement to those who pay attention to social culture.</p>
