<h3>英日談判</h3>
<p>— 張忠紱</p>
<p>在九一八事變發生以前，英日兩國間的關係其為良好。在過去三十年中，英國在遠東與太平洋方面利益的保障，大部靠與日本成立的同盟或諒解•九一八事變以後，英政府在初對日表示好感，嗣後採取靜候的政策。直到一九三四年的冬季以後，因日本前進不已的緣故，英政府遂不得不改變其在遠東的政策，採取以實力壓迫日本就範的手段。於是一方充實英帝國在遠東的國防，一方與美國合作，與俄國妥協，并積極的援助中國。</p>
<p>因英國現時的利益需要和平，因英國在遠東的利益，需要保全中國的領土完整與門戶開放的原則，而同時希望中日兩國間的問題得以和平解决，故所以英國願意與日本談判，成立妥協，而并且希望中日兩國間亦能成立妥協。英日談判，從英國的立塲看，這是英政府早經决定的政策，無足驚異。</p>
<p>至於日本，從九一八事變以後，日本國內的實力派，滿以為日本遂行其大陸政策的時機，業已成熟，日本可以在中國為所欲為，不必顧慮他國的反對。然而事態的演進，使日本感覺日本過去觀察的錯誤。九一八事變後日本所採取的急進政策的反響，已陷日本於孤立的地位。中國的逐漸統一，俄國的充實遠東的軍備，美國的建艦計劃，再加以英國最近三十個月來的積極措施，使日本欲進不可，欲退不能。日本的念進派欲打破這種局面，故所以有去冬的日德協定。日德協定，在表面上，似乎有利於日本，可以使日本不再孤立。然而在實質上，日德協定至少暫時對日本無所助益。法西斯蒂主義國家的聯合，反促成了英法美等國更密切的合作，與對抗的决心與準備。日德協定的結果，并未能使日本立卽衝破日本急進政策所遭遇的阻礙。</p>
<p>因日本現時無力衝破日本急進政策所遭遇的阻礙，日本的大陸政策仍然不能立卽遂行，不能在中國為所欲為，而不必顧慮他國的反對，是以日本不得不改變其對外方策，一方對中國宣言，日本雖不放棄其所謂之廣田三原則，但此時并不欲其立卽實現，一方對英美等國，暫時放棄其立卽獨力支配東亞之主張，而願與此等國家談判中國問題，但同時努力作大戰的準備，以待世界國際情勢的變動。英日談判，從日本的立塲看，這是日本現時不能衝破日本急进政策所遭遇的阻碍的折中方策。</p>
<p>論到英日兩國在此次談判中關於中國的主張，我們也不難測度。英國的主張，在理論上，自然是中國的領土完整與門戶開放，以便保衛美國在華的利益。然而在事實上，英國自然不至於完全漠視日本的立塲。美國的重要利益，集中在華中與華南兩處。對於華北，英國或可容許日本在事實上獲得較大的經濟權益，而在法律上，則日本必須承認中國的領土完整與門戶開放。對於東北四省，英國或可承認旣在事實，但必須中國。美國。與國聯同時承認。至於蔞北境內的門戶開放問題，則英國的態度或將視日本對於英日兩國間的商務態度而定。</p>
<p>至於在此次談判中，日本方面關於中國問題的主張，據我個人的觀察，日本的主張，在理論上，自然是：承認東北四省的現狀，并承認日本在華北的優越地位。然而在事實上，日本旣肯降心相從，與英國談判中國問題，日本自亦不能完全漠視英國的立塲，對於華中華南兩處，日本現時的實力，旣不能達到，當不至引起重要的爭執。對於華北與東北四省，日本究將退讓至何種程度，此時殊無從斷言，這自然要看此後的國際情勢與英日兩國間的其他問題如何解决而定。大概言之，則對於東北四省，日本必將堅持維持現狀，至於東北四省境內的門戶開放原則，與偽國問題，以及日本要求承認日本在華北的優越地位的問題，日本必將利用之以為談判的交換條件，而作相對的退讓。</p>
<p>此次英日的談判，當然不限於中國問題，而影響所及，當然亦不限於英日兩國。這次的英日談判，如克繼續，我們應當視為整個世界和平談判的一部份，應當視為太平洋上各國間和平談判的起點。英日談判的成功或失敗，必將影響到整個的世界國際政治，與太平洋上各國間的關係。</p>
<p>此次英日談判的性質，旣如是重要，而對於中國的關係，又如是密切，我國的政府似不應只採取消極的態度，僅僅宣言，英日談判必須尊重中國的領土完整，必須尊重中國的意見，并取得中國的同意。我們應當提出具體的主張，并積極的在外交上有所活動。我國政府至少應當在英日談判的進行期中，與英政府取得密切的聯絡，探悉英日談判關於中國問題的進展，隨時表示我國對此問題的意見，以袪除不利於我國的諒解，反對未曾議决的方案，較之推翻已經議决的方案，是有難易之別的。若必等到英日諒解，業已成立之後，然後再表示異議，則屆時我國已處於不利的地位，外交上的進行，當更為困難。不知我國外交當局亦以為然否？</p>

<h3>日軍突襲宛平經過</h3>
<p>日軍深夜要求開城搜査失卒　我軍以其無理卽行嚴厲拒絕　日軍數次攻擊並向豐台增援</p>
<p>天津通信、八日早、駐防宛平蘆溝橋之二十九軍突被日軍襲擊、一時情勢極趨嚴重、茲將該項事件之遠因近果分述如後、</p>
<p>肇事遠因</p>
<p>二十九軍自去年被日軍無理壓逼撤出豐台後、即在宛平縣永定河岸駐防、城內外駐三十七師馮治安部步兵一營另三連、其地去北平三十餘里、去豐台七里、去盧溝橋約三里以位於平漢•平綏•北寗•三路交叉中心、頗據形勢、駐豐台日軍嘗因該地馮師駐在、竟一再要求當局撤退該地駐軍及將長辛店讓出、我方當即拒絕、去冬、日方為求擴大豐台兵營、增加駐軍計、乃擬在蘆溝橋長辛店宛平縣三地間置一軍事堡壘、以為豐台駐軍犄角、而便於監視我方宛平•永定河駐軍、後因民衆反對、紛請當局交涉制止、未容日方如願以償、然日方無時不夢想此事之實現也、</p>
<p>衝突口實</p>
<p>最近一週、豐台日駐軍嘉田•市木•兩大隊騎步兵、逐日在蘆溝橋附近演習示威、我駐軍悉隱忍不較、七日晚、嘉田部隊一中隊復於蘆溝橋演習夜戰、旣畢、點名發覺缺少斥堠騎兵一名、據日方事後聲稱、彼時忽聞宛平縣城內槍聲一響、即藉此為口實、謂宛平城內駐軍向日兵射擊、其失蹤之兵士、當係被我方擊斃、於是要求入城搜査、我駐軍以時在午夜居民皆已入睡、恐一遭驚擾、治安必紊、予以拒絕、駐平日軍特務機關長松井、根據嘉田之報吿、以電話通加秦德純、要求飭令宛平縣開城、業亦以前項理由答覆、嗣松井復以電話吿秦、謂如不許日軍入城、即武裝衛護隊伍入內、同時宛平縣駐軍及專員公署、亦以電話向秦報吿、云日軍增加至四五百名、對宛平縣城取包圍攻勢、盼速交涉制止、秦乃通知松井、要求彼方速派員恊助冀察會中人馳往調査勸阻、松井乃派其副機關長寺平•駐平步兵第一聯隊長车岡口•恊同冀察會軍事顧問日人櫻井、宛平專員王冷齊、冀察名委會參議林耕宇、冀察交通委會參議孫永業等、乘汽車前往肇事地點、</p>
<p>大舉圍攻</p>
<p>寺平到後、竟拋却其調査使命、代嘉田仍申前項要求、正爭持間、突然東門發現槍擊、西門則起砲聲、並雜以機關槍聲、我守軍初時尚力持鎭靜、後見對方壓迫漸緊、砲火漸密、遂奮起抵抗、雙方對抗至九時許、槍砲聲始稀、我駐蘆溝橋附近龍王廟軍約一排、不及撤退為日軍所乘而繳械、衝突略停後、我方檢査死傷共二十餘人日方則死傷小隊長以下十餘人、此際平津雙方當局、均已得悉、互以電話接洽各飭自方隊伍、停止攻擊、惟日軍則散兵綫臥倒於水定河岸叢林內、取待機之勢、牟田口則要求我宛平駐軍立即退出、永定河岸軍隊、亦須撤退、我則不允、至十一時半談判仍無結果、衝突乃再起、但未幾即停止、仍繼行談洽、日方要求如前、惟已聲明失踪之兵士、業已返隊、對二十九軍射殺其士卒一點、作罷不談、祇認二十九軍有抗日行為、必須撤退、我則堅持須日軍回返原防、以後再談其他、談判終歸决裂、午後三時、復發生衝突、三時半再停、牟田口即於此時致通牒於王冷齊、及宛平城內駐軍、限晚六時退出、否則大舉進攻、我未之睬、迄六時、日方無甚動靜、八時左右、槍砲聲復作、其後情况不明、聞張自忠已於晚十時乘汽車趕肇事地調査、擬設法阻止事態之擴大、</p>
<p>日兵增援</p>
<p>駐津日軍司令部得報後、八日晨六時、即召集緊急會議、因田代臥病、由橋本代為主席、邀集幹部將校商討、旋派第一課長和知、參謀安達、乘汽車赴平、恊同松井與秦德純交涉、同時日步兵三百餘、乘載重汽車馳往宛平增援、復有輜重兵五十餘、則於午後一時許索北寗專車一列押運大批械彈開豐台轉運前方、其後尚擬續派軍隊前往、向北寗路索車、該路予以拒絕、局長陳覺生並傳令各路員、在此情况下、不能為日方撥車、故迄八日夜、駐津日軍無續開出者、現豐台共駐日軍千餘人、通州千餘人、北平八百餘、我駐平•通•蘆溝橋•長辛店•軍隊、則約兩旅三團、日軍旅團長河邊、頃在豐台、聯隊長牟田口則在宛平城外、此種對峙局面與衝突、入夜似已轉劇、駐津日軍部、午夜尚在海光寺集議</p>
<p>交通情况</p>
<p>八日早、平津長途電話一度不通、至六時方恢復、惟終日呌號者過於擁濟致感傳達消息困難、北寗路由平開津各次客車、上午均無阻、後亡第三次•第五次•第三日一次•各誤一時許、因二十九軍已在永定門附近檢査行旅、防奸宄乘間混入騷擾、九時以後聞豐台附近第某號橋鐵軌、經我軍自動拆毀一段、以阻敵軍進襲、由津開平各列客車、除午後二時有一列已達北平外、餘則先到黃村、候豐台電話、吿以無礙、始行駛進、但抵豐台因前方阻止入北平城、遂均由豐台折回、旅客亦均未下車八日晚八時、北平戒嚴、馮治安•邵文凱•陳繼淹•分任戒嚴止副司令、各城門繁閉、祇留正陽門通出入、檢査行人戒備甚嚴、宋哲元在樂陵得訊、除已報吿中央外、即飭前往謁見之冀察建委會主席委員門致中於八日午回平、齊其意旨、傳達於秦德純等、是時、二十九軍高級幹部張自忠•馮治安•均在平主持一切至津平雖空氣極形緊張、人心尚不致浮動、</p>
<p>日軍示威</p>
<p>八日午後三時、駐津日軍裝甲汽車三十餘部、坦克車十餘部、步砲兵數百、分為兩批、在津河北大經路、特二區金湯大馬路、遊行示威、路面均為坦克車所碾壞•遊行移時始返營、午刻、惠通改造之日軍用飛機三架、在津市上空盤旋、未幾沿北寗路飛往豐台、以此間日軍司令部態度觀察、日方亟欲佔領該地、確有是野心、惟二十九軍此番態度之嚴正、對抗之激烈、則殊出日方意料所及也（八日）</p>

<h3>如何動員下鄕建設農村（續）</h3>
<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>（六月二十八日在廣東省政府各機關討論農村建設動員問題聯席會議席上講）</p>
<p>小學校的校長敎師、可以就近指導鄕長處理一切鄕政、作鄕長鄕公所的顧問與指導者、並且可以幫助努力識字運動、保安隊可以帮助鄕長編練保甲、訓練壯丁、以期保安隊與農村打成一片、欲達到這個目的、我想在壯丁三個月短短的時間訓練完畢以後、就將已受訓的壯丁編入保安隊、作在營訓練、一年後退伍、編為後備隊、如此不獨可使壯丁訓練確實、並且可使保安隊與地方發生密切關係、同時也足以為準備實行徵兵制的基礎工作、其次、廣東荒山很多、廣東不但鬧米荒、同時廣東的燃料、也是一個很嚴重的問題、我們廣東、只曉得砍伐樹木、而不知造林、這樣下去、終有一天會缺乏燃料的、假使不及早圖之、將來眞不得了、所以造林運動在廣東、也為當前之一大急務、造林不但可以解决廣東的燃料问題、並且還可以防旱災水災、現在廣東省紙廠開工在即、將來開工後、每日所需木材也很不少、所以這個問題、實在是一個很嚴重的問題、我們不能不預為之謀、所以我們政府現在預備定一個全省各地方的造林計劃出來、我們需要何種木材、我們全省就造何種林、將來計劃擬走以後、我們就要施諸實行這項工作、我們也想要我們的保安隊直接來參加、現在我們全省保安隊共有四十一大隊之多、人數將近二萬人、分佈於全省各地、平日除留一部份維持地方自治外、其餘都可以輪流出來、作一點地方的事業、如訓練壯丁•墾荒造林•以及他幫助老百姓築簡單的防水工程等等、</p>
<p>剛才我說過、想利用各縣的學校來作我們農村建設運動的中心、但是我們恐怕各縣的鄕村裏、有許多沒有學校或者雖有學校、而組織簡陋、校長敎員的智識能力很淺薄、那還是不足以担負起這個責任的、我們廣東全省、原共有一萬三千九百九十八鄕、七百八十四鎭、現在我們拿區取消、改為聯鄕自治制、改了聯鄕自治制後、各鄕都縮編、縮編結果、由一萬三千九百九十八鄕、縮為四千八百四十六鄕、由七百四十八鎭、縮為二百六十三鎭、一鄕就是一個小單位、廣東有四千八百四十六鄕、就是有四千八百四十六個單位、以九十七縣來平均、每縣平均有四百多鄕、換言之、就是一個縣政府要指揮四百多個單位如果單位裏沒有組織、或者組織不健全、在這個時候、要是這個單位裏有一個很健全的學校、這個學校、就可以作一鎭或一鄕的顧問與指導、但是據敎育廳的調査、各縣各鎭各鄕不一定都有學校、就是有學校、也都很簡陋、恐怕担當不起這種重大的任務、所以我想出了一個補救的辦法、這個補救的辦法就是我想招集考取本省初中以上的學生、訓練六個月九個月或一年、（時間長短視課程多少再定）灌輸各種需要的簡單知識技術、如關於地方自沽合作•造林•水利•以及軍軍訓練•等各方面預定招五百人至一千人、訓練完畢後、即分發到各縣去服務、每一個人一定要負責於幾個月內完成幾件事工、或者分期來舉辦、假定每期為一個月、第一個三個月、要領導鄕民把鄕公所的組織組織好、第二個三個月、拿各鄕的保甲編好、或者把合作社組織好、分發各鄕去、我們給一個具體的工作給他、寅成他分期去完成、如果能有學校作中心、又有保安隊來參加、再補充農村建設工作人員、分發到全省各縣各鄕去帮助　來做通力合作、或者可以使農村建設運動、於三年以內、能得到相當的成績、把農村經濟的基礎、培植起來、如果能有成績、老百姓一定很高興跟着我們努力來做、如此下去、十年以後、廣東省農村建設運動、一定可以有一點成績表現出來、</p>
<p>我今天所提出的這個問題、實在是一個很重大很迫切問題、現在經費已有着落、計劃亦即將草擬完竣、當前的問題、只在人的問題、就是如何去動員、這個問題、就是人員的如何利用、人員的如何訓練、以及人員的如何組織、所以我今天提出這個問題、並附帶提出個人的意見、供各位的參考、希望各位詳加討論、共同訂定一個計劃出來、使廣東省的農村建設運動因為有得力的人員之推進、能得到很好的成效、（完）</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Plans to Expand the Situation, and the Situation in North China Is Extremely Serious</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Attack Lugou Bridge and Bomb Wanping City. Fierce Fighting This Morning, Our Troops Fight Back Bravely. The Japanese Kwantung Army Assembles at Shanhaiguan Station Awaiting Orders. Our Authorities State That They Are Determined to Deal With the Situation if Absolutely Necessary.</p>
<p>[Beiping] At 5:30 PM on the 10th, Japanese troops from Fengtai suddenly launched a fierce attack with artillery and machine guns on the bridge and Wanping County. Our troops fought back in self-defense. The attack reportedly stopped slightly at 6:30 PM, but at 7:30 PM, the Japanese resumed firing, causing casualties on both sides. If the situation continues to escalate, Japan should be held responsible. (Central News Agency, 11:55 AM, 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] At 1:15 AM on the 11th, Japanese troops began a second bombardment of Lugou Bridge. Our troops resisted bravely, and the fighting was fierce. The Japanese troops have now retreated. The sound of gunfire is extremely dense in the Daijingcun and northern Wanping County area. (Central News Agency, 3:50 AM, 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The long-distance telephone between Beiping and Tianjin was still operating normally on the night of the 10th and was not interrupted. (Central News Agency, 3:00 AM, 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] It has been confirmed that the Japanese army surrounded Wanping at 5:10 PM on the 10th and suddenly launched a fierce attack on our troops guarding the culvert outside the city. At 7:00 PM, they switched to artillery bombardment, which stopped slightly after a while. At 7:30 PM, they increased their infantry and artillery by several hundred from Fengtai, intensifying the attack. The sound of gunfire did not cease until after 11:00 PM. The Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters issued a statement at 11:00 PM on the 10th, claiming that the three previous attacks were all initiated by our troops and that if this continued, a major unfortunate incident would occur, for which we would be responsible. It is clear that they want to expand the situation and shift the responsibility to us. (Urgent dispatch, 4:00 AM, 11th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] At 1:15 AM on the 11th, Japanese troops launched a fierce attack on Lugou Bridge with rifles, machine guns, and artillery. Our defending troops also fought back bravely. The fierce fighting continued until 3:00 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 3:00 AM, 11th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to sources, from 6:00 AM to 1:00 PM on the 10th, five trains carrying over 2,000 Japanese soldiers from the Kwantung Army arrived at Shanhaiguan from Jinzhou and Suizhong, and stopped at Shanhaiguan station awaiting orders. Over 2,000 troops from the North China Garrison in the Yuhuangmiao, Qinhuangdao, and Nanda Temple areas have also been ordered to assemble, and because the Beining Railway did not allocate vehicles, they have requisitioned vehicles from the pseudo-Fengshan Railway Bureau, intending to wait for orders to move inward. At 6:00 AM on the 10th, artillery from the Suzuki Regiment of the Japanese garrison in Li Mingzhuang, Tianjin, and machine gun squads from the Kayashima Regiment, traveled in dozens of heavy trucks and rushed east to Fengtai and then to Lugou Bridge to reinforce the troops. It is reported that the Kwantung Army has a tough attitude and tends to support the North China Garrison in expanding the situation. The situation in North China has become serious, and the Lugou Bridge incident cannot be resolved as quickly as expected. On the 10th, the Tianjin Japanese Army Headquarters hosted reporters from Tianjin and other places and gave a detailed explanation of the Lugou Bridge battle situation, but did not mention withdrawing troops. According to observations by foreign reporters, the Japanese attitude may be due to the excessive number of casualties among their troops, and they intend to retaliate, turning to a reckless mentality. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Japanese troops at Lugou Bridge have been increasing, and they are actively constructing various fortifications. At around 6:00 PM on the 10th, the Japanese troops in the area provoked our troops again, and a conflict immediately broke out. The two sides exchanged fire for about two hours before it stopped. The current situation is quite serious. (Urgent dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10:30 PM, 10th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] It is widely rumored that the Japanese troops who withdrew last night have now returned to the Wanping County area, causing panic again. It is reported that this afternoon, 600 Japanese soldiers, carrying four tanks and twenty-seven field guns, left Fengtai. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Wanping County is under siege by Japanese troops, and the sound of gunfire has gradually intensified after 11:00 PM. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] At 10:40 PM tonight, we received news from Chinese military circles that the fierce battle in Wanping is still ongoing. Semi-official Japanese sources said that Chinese troops fired on Japanese reinforcements, but the Japanese troops did not return fire. The Chinese troops stopped firing after more than an hour. However, the Chinese side said that the Chinese troops would never open fire without provocation, and the exchange of fire and artillery battles were prolonged. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Trains on the Beining Railway's Beiping-Tianjin section stopped running again at 4:00 PM today, and long-distance telephone service was also cut off after 5:30 PM. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Students from various schools in Beiping have risen up in unison, forming groups to comfort the troops and organizing ambulance teams to rescue wounded soldiers. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The issue of the refusal of 300 Japanese troops near Lugou Bridge to withdraw has caused a major misunderstanding between the two sides. Currently, Japanese troops are actively increasing their forces in various suburbs of Beiping and constructing fortifications. In order to prevent this, wherever Japanese troops are stationed, our troops are also stationed. Currently, the two sides are in a standoff, and the situation seems quite serious. Our authorities have stated that they are willing to resolve the matter peacefully throughout, and even though negotiations are unable to proceed, they are determined to make the greatest effort. If it is absolutely necessary, they will have to fulfill their duty to defend the country and deal with the situation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to sources, ten trains of Japanese soldiers arriving from Liaoning, each with about 1,000 people, have arrived at Shanhaiguan. About ten trucks carrying 40 to 50 Japanese soldiers each have arrived from Tianjin. In view of this situation, all parties believe that Japan intends to expand the Lugou Bridge provocation. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Bombard Wanping County</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] After 7:00 PM, Japanese troops from Fengtai continued to reinforce Lugou Bridge. The rumbling sound of artillery could be heard between Huangcun and Fengtai. Long-distance telephone lines between Beiping and Fengtai and between Beiping and Lugou Bridge were cut off. The Morita and Katada Battalions of the Japanese army occupied the high ground northeast of Wanping City and bombarded the city. Over 300 members of our Jibei security forces were trapped in the city, fighting desperately. It is also reported that the troops of our 29th Army, who retreated to the right bank of the Yongding River, exchanged fire with the Japanese army across the river. After 8:00 PM, the conflict intensified, and the situation in that area is completely unknown. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The two sides at Lugou Bridge have been demobilizing since noon yesterday. Last night, our troops completely returned to their original establishment. However, after 2:30 AM today, gunshots and machine gun fire were suddenly heard again in Beiping. This continued for about half an hour. After investigation, it was found that our side was quiet as usual and took no action. The other side was firing for no reason. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Traffic Between Beiping and Fengtai Completely Cut Off</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] All passenger trains from Beiping that arrived in Fengtai on the afternoon of the 10th were blocked and returned in the evening. Traffic between Beiping and Fengtai was completely cut off after 9:00 PM, but long-distance telephone service between Beiping and Tianjin was still operating normally. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] At 3:00 PM on the 10th, a clear sound of artillery fire was heard at Lugou Bridge. At the same time, the situation in Fengtai was unclear. The city gates of Beiping were reinforced with sandbags, and traffic was only possible on the Tianjin-Fengtai section. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Traffic between Beiping and Tianjin was restored on the morning of the 10th, but due to martial law in Beiping, the departure times of all trains were delayed. The time for passenger trains to enter Beiping was between 7:00 AM and 7:00 PM. After this time, they were not allowed to depart or enter. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Kawabe Commands the Entire Army in Fengtai</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Brigade Commander Kawabe and Infantry First Regiment Commander Mutaguchi believe that their units have suffered too many casualties and are unwilling to negotiate. Kawabe is now commanding the entire army in Fengtai, while Mutaguchi is making arrangements in Beiping. Hashimoto is inspecting the troops and consoling the wounded soldiers in the Fengtai-Lugou Bridge area. The post-war conference has not yet begun. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Did Not Retreat but Fired on Us</h3>
<p>[Beiping] After the Chinese and Japanese troops at Lugou Bridge withdrew simultaneously on the 9th, our troops withdrew to designated locations. However, more than 200 Japanese troops remained near the railway tracks near Lugou Bridge. The Japanese Provisional Headquarters claimed that the bodies of two Japanese soldiers killed in the battle had not been found and that they had to search for them there. Despite repeated negotiations with our side, they ignored us. As a result, a misunderstanding occurred once again at around 9:00 PM on the 9th, and the troops opened machine gun fire on us. This was the faint sound of gunfire heard in the southwest corner of Beiping that night. After our side persuaded them to stop, they stopped. We are still urging them to withdraw from Lugou Bridge as soon as possible to prevent any eventuality. The security of Wanping City has been completely assigned to the security team, and they have begun to maintain order. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Peace Negotiations at a Standstill</h3>
<p>More than 200 Japanese troops remain at Wulidian near Lugou Bridge and have not withdrawn. Regarding this issue, Chinese and Japanese personnel met at Zhang Yunrong's residence on the afternoon of the 10th. Our side was represented by Qin Dechun, Feng Zhian, and Wang Lengzhai, and the Japanese side was represented by Sakurai and others. They discussed the matter for several hours, but because the Japanese side's attitude was firm, there was no result, and negotiations entered a standstill. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Hashimoto Arrives in Beiping and Holds Multiple Meetings</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Chief of Staff of the Tianjin Garrison, Hashimoto Gun, came to Beiping yesterday and met with various Japanese officials in the evening. The talks continued this morning, but he has not yet met with our side. It is reported that Hashimoto still advocates accepting a peaceful resolution verbally, while secretly attempting to expand military action. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Reinforcements for the Japanese Army Arrive from the East in a Steady Stream</h3>
<p>[Beiping] After twenty-four hours of tranquility, Japanese troops reappeared in Wanping tonight and began to surround the city. Fierce fighting has broken out between Chinese and Japanese troops, and the situation in North China has suddenly become tense again. This unexpected change has led the Chinese authorities to close all the city gates of Beiping again. Prior to this, there was a half-hour of fierce fighting in the Wanping area, and the sound of artillery could be heard in Beiping. It is said that the Japanese troops heading to Wanping are 600 troops stationed in Fengtai, four tanks, and twenty-seven field guns, as well as a detachment from the pseudo-autonomous region of eastern Hebei. Sandbags and other obstacles have now been placed at all strategic locations in Beiping, and traffic has been stopped at 8:00 PM, with only trucks full of Chinese soldiers leaving the city. Chinese and Japanese officials are holding a peace conference at the residence of Zhang Yunrong, commander of the Hebei Security Forces, but since the fighting has resumed, the conference has been suspended. Traffic on the Beiping-Tianjin Railway has now been interrupted. It is reported that the Blue Steel Train does not intend to go south. At the same time, it is reported that six trains of the Kwantung Army have arrived at Shanhaiguan from Shenyang, and the Japanese troops have disembarked there, but the empty trains are still fired up and waiting. It is reported that large numbers of Japanese troops are stationed in various key locations along the Great Wall, and reinforcements are still arriving in a steady stream. Two regiments of the 29th Army are stationed at Yongdingmen, controlling the main road leading to Wanping, and have dismantled the tracks to prevent enemy troops from advancing. It is rumored that Japanese troops are dismantling roads in Fengtai to obstruct military action. The Japanese army claims that the Chinese army has reoccupied Wanping, so they are attacking fiercely. Tonight, official sources claimed that the Japanese army wants to use Wanping as its military concentration point, and the Chinese army is determined to resist and not allow the Japanese army to occupy the city. The Chinese army has indeed withdrawn according to the agreed-upon method yesterday in order to avoid conflict, but it has not abandoned its right to garrison the city. A Japanese spokesman here tonight said that the Japanese army is creating a situation in Wanping that will prevent such conflicts from recurring, but the spokesman was unwilling to elaborate on what this meant. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] A portion of the Japanese troops from Tangshan and Tanggu moved towards Fengtai along the Tang-Tong-Tang-Jin highway on the 10th as a reserve force. Since the evening of the 9th, many Japanese troops have been gathered in the Changji, Jinan, and Nanda Temple areas around Tangshan. Military transport is extremely busy on the Tang-Yu-Fengtai section of the railway. According to sources, the railway tracks on the Lugou Bridge-Beiping-Hankou and Beining Railways were destroyed by Japanese troops at 4:00 PM on the 10th, cutting off the connection between the two lines.

<h3>A Report on the Inspection of Wanping City</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Have Not Withdrawn From Wulidian. Detailed Account of the Course of the Conflict.</p>
<p>[Beiping] This reporter went to Lugou Bridge again on the morning of the 10th and arrived at Guang'anmen at 7:00 AM. The gate was half-open, and vegetable vendors and peddlers, due to the two-day traffic disruption, took this opportunity to enter the city, so the pedestrians were particularly crowded. At 7:20 AM, I arrived at Wulidian. Looking at the Japanese army encampment on the Ping-Han Railway tracks, I learned that more than 200 Japanese troops had not withdrawn from the Lugou Bridge area. Some Japanese soldiers were still erecting artillery positions on the high ground, aiming at the Lugou stone bridge and the railway culvert. Japanese soldiers were questioning pedestrians, but they were not very obstructive. Just behind the culvert is Wanping County, and the east gate is still tightly closed, making it impossible to pass through. Only the west gate is half-open, and pedestrians can enter and leave after being interrogated. There are a total of 150 security guards in the city, led by Captain Jia, who, together with County Police Officer Bai Rongguang, are responsible for maintaining order. The general situation is still quite calm, but the shops have not yet opened, and the residents' doors are tightly closed. Everything is still. As for the defense, because our army has withdrawn to the west of the bridge and the Japanese troops who have not withdrawn have set up a temporary headquarters next to the railway tracks only one or two hundred meters away, vigilance cannot be relaxed. According to Wanping County Police Officer Bai Rongguang, after the conflict occurred in the late night of the 7th, the Japanese side sent us a note on the 8th, demanding that everyone from the county magistrate down to the common people withdraw completely before 6:00 AM in order to take over the city. At that time, County Magistrate Wang could not contact his superiors by telephone or telegram, and he only discussed the matter all day with me (Bai claimed) and Battalion Commander Jin, but they were unable to reach a result. The Japanese army had already opened fire, and their target was entirely the county government because the county government roof had a flagpole, which could be used as a standard for their firing. Therefore, the county government was hit by four artillery shells at the same time, and the county magistrate's bedroom, large reception room, and the third section office were destroyed. Later, when the flagpole was removed, the target of the artillery fire was suddenly lost, and it fell mostly on civilian houses. In total, the Japanese army bombarded Wanping County three times: once after 3:00 AM on the night of the 7th, once after 10:00 AM on the morning of the 8th, and once after 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, firing more than 200 artillery shells in total. The exact number of our casualties is still unknown, but more than sixty corpses have been collected and transported to the Changxindian Cemetery for burial. Approximately one hundred and twenty wounded have also been transported to temporary hospitals for treatment. The exact number of Japanese casualties is unknown, but it is not much different from ours. The dead have been transported to Fengtai or Tianjin. From this point of view, this battle cannot be said to be not fierce. After parting with Bai, this reporter went to various streets and alleys for a rough inspection. Because the handover had just begun, the security was still tight, so I could not be completely free. Moreover, it had just stopped raining, and the roads were muddy. Except for the patrols of the security team, there were very few pedestrians coming and going, and the scene was bleak, which only increased anger. Furthermore, because all losses are still being investigated and the people have just recovered from their shock, they are unwilling to chat with outsiders, so it is quite difficult to investigate.

<p>[Beiping] A team of about fifty Japanese soldiers is stationed half a mile east of Wanping City, using the railway embankment as cover, while about three hundred soldiers of the 29th Army are stationed on the opposite bank of the Yongding River, defending the western end of Lugou Bridge. The rest have retreated towards Changxindian. This morning, several foreign officials and journalists were stopped and interrogated by Japanese soldiers near Wanping. After declaring that they were not carrying cameras, they were allowed to proceed. Upon reaching Wanping, the traces of artillery fire on the city walls were clearly visible, especially on the east gate, which was hit by Japanese artillery fire on both the fourth and fifth days of the week. About fifty artillery shells landed in the city, and half of the administrative offices were destroyed by the bombing. Fortunately, the people in the office had evacuated a quarter of an hour earlier. The office and a nearby hotel were also hit by Japanese artillery fire. Examining the shell fragments, it can be seen that the artillery used by the Japanese army was 37 mm to 3 inches in caliber. During the fighting on the fourth and fifth days of the week, the 29th Army had 2,000 dead, 20 seriously wounded, and 50 slightly wounded. The Japanese army suffered 10 dead, 2 missing, and 22 wounded. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 10th)</p>

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhongfu</p>
<p>Before the September 18th Incident, the relationship between Great Britain and Japan was excellent. For the past thirty years, the protection of British interests in the Far East and the Pacific has largely relied on alliances or understandings with Japan. After the September 18th Incident, the British government initially expressed goodwill towards Japan, and then adopted a policy of waiting and seeing. It was not until after the winter of 1934 that the British government had to change its policy in the Far East due to Japan's continuous advancement, and adopted the method of using strength to force Japan to comply. Thus, on one hand, it strengthened the defense of the British Empire in the Far East, and on the other hand, it cooperated with the United States, reached a compromise with Russia, and actively assisted China.</p>
<p>Because Britain's current interests require peace, and because Britain's interests in the Far East require the preservation of China's territorial integrity and the Open Door policy, while also hoping that the problems between China and Japan can be resolved peacefully, Britain is willing to negotiate with Japan and reach a compromise, and also hopes that China and Japan can also reach a compromise. From Britain's standpoint, Anglo-Japanese negotiations are a policy that the British government has long decided on, and there is nothing surprising about it.</p>
<p>As for Japan, since the September 18th Incident, the powerful figures in Japan have believed that the time for Japan to carry out its continental policy has matured, and Japan can do whatever it wants in China without having to worry about opposition from other countries. However, the evolution of the situation has made Japan feel that its past observations were wrong. The reaction to the radical policies adopted by Japan after the September 18th Incident has placed Japan in an isolated position. China's gradual unification, Russia's strengthening of its military preparations in the Far East, the United States' naval construction plan, and Britain's recent active measures over the past thirty months have made Japan unable to advance or retreat. The pro-advancement faction in Japan wants to break this situation, which is why there was the German-Japanese agreement last winter. On the surface, the German-Japanese agreement seems to be beneficial to Japan and can make Japan no longer isolated. However, in essence, the German-Japanese agreement is at least temporarily of no help to Japan. The alliance of fascist countries has instead promoted closer cooperation and determination and preparation for confrontation among Britain, France, the the United States, and other countries. The result of the German-Japanese agreement has not enabled Japan to immediately break through the obstacles encountered by Japan's radical policies.</p>
<p>Because Japan currently lacks the strength to break through the obstacles encountered by Japan's radical policies, Japan's continental policy still cannot be implemented immediately and cannot do whatever it wants in China without having to worry about opposition from other countries, Japan has to change its foreign policy. On one hand, it declared to China that although Japan will not abandon its so-called Hirota Three Principles, it does not want them to be realized immediately at this time. On the other hand, it temporarily abandoned its claim to independently dominate East Asia to Britain, the United States, and other countries and is willing to negotiate with these countries on the China issue, but at the same time, it is working hard to prepare for a major war to await changes in the world's international situation. From Japan's standpoint, Anglo-Japanese negotiations are a compromise policy when Japan currently cannot break through the obstacles encountered by Japan's radical policies.</p>
<p>When it comes to the claims of Britain and Japan regarding China in this negotiation, it is not difficult for us to speculate. In theory, Britain's claim is naturally China's territorial integrity and the Open Door policy in order to protect American interests in China. However, in fact, Britain will naturally not completely disregard Japan's standpoint. The important interests of the United States are concentrated in Central China and South China. For North China, Britain may allow Japan to obtain greater economic interests in fact, but in law, Japan must recognize China's territorial integrity and the Open Door policy. For the four northeastern provinces, Britain may recognize the fact, but China, the the United States, and the League of Nations must recognize it at the same time. As for the issue of the Open Door policy within the four northeastern provinces, Britain's attitude will depend on Japan's business attitude towards Britain and Japan.</p>
<p>As for Japan's claim regarding the China issue in this negotiation, according to my personal observation, Japan's claim is naturally: to recognize the current situation in the four northeastern provinces and to recognize Japan's superior position in North China. However, in fact, since Japan is willing to condescend and negotiate with Britain on the China issue, Japan also cannot completely disregard Britain's standpoint. With regard to Central China and South China, Japan's current strength cannot reach it, so it should not cause major disputes. With regard to North China and the four northeastern provinces, to what extent will Japan retreat? It is impossible to say at this time, which naturally depends on how the international situation and other issues between Britain and Japan are resolved in the future. Generally speaking, for the four northeastern provinces, Japan will insist on maintaining the status quo. As for the Open Door principle within the four northeastern provinces, the puppet state issue, and Japan's request to recognize Japan's superior position in North China, Japan will use it as a bargaining chip for negotiation and make relative concessions.</p>
<p>This Anglo-Japanese negotiation is of course not limited to the China issue, and its impact is of course not limited to Britain and Japan. If this Anglo-Japanese negotiation can continue, we should regard it as a part of the entire world peace negotiation and as the starting point of peace negotiations among countries in the Pacific. The success or failure of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations will affect the entire world's international politics and the relations among countries in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Since the nature of this Anglo-Japanese negotiation is so important and its relationship with China is so close, our government should not only adopt a passive attitude, merely declaring that the Anglo-Japanese negotiations must respect China's territorial integrity, must respect China's opinions, and must obtain China's consent. We should put forward concrete claims and actively engage in diplomatic activities. Our government should at least maintain close contact with the British government during the Anglo-Japanese negotiations to find out the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations on the China issue and express our country's views on this issue at any time to eliminate understandings that are unfavorable to our country. Opposing an unapproved plan is easier than overturning an approved plan. If we must wait until the Anglo-Japanese understanding has been established before expressing our disagreement, then our country will be in an unfavorable position at that time, and diplomatic progress will be more difficult. I wonder if our diplomatic authorities also think so?</p>

<h3>Anglo-Japanese Business Negotiations Mostly Inconclusive</h3>
<p>Only Agreed to Close Cooperation in the Future - Group Discussions Still in Progress</p>
<p>[London] The Federation of British Industries recently issued a public statement regarding its discussions with the Japanese Economic Survey Group, stating, "There are many issues discussed by both parties, among which the most important are ⑴ the issue of restrictions on Japanese goods in most markets of the British Empire, ⑵ whether various industries in Britain and Japan can enter into agreements to cooperate, ⑶ issues of commercial notes and registration regulations. During the discussions, the Japanese representatives pointed out that Japanese cotton textiles are generally subject to unfair and discriminatory treatment in most British dominions. In addition, some dominion governments are restricting most of Japan's trade through their own independent actions, but regardless of how restricted, Japan's export trade volume continues to increase. The British and Japanese sides subsequently agreed that industrial organizations of the two countries should cooperate closely to lay the foundation for entering into agreements for various industries of both sides. The industrial federations of the two countries should be responsible for liaison work so that any industry on either side will not conflict with its counterpart. Both parties also agreed that the industrial federations of the two countries should find ways to exchange information on the scope of industrial sales markets at any time so that it will be easier to implement when an agreement is reached in the future. As for the issue of developing commerce in East Asian countries, both parties believe that the prospect of British and Japanese cooperation there is very broad. Group discussions between both parties are still ongoing, and if necessary, a plenary meeting will be held again at the end of this month."

<h3>Russia and Sweden Celebrate</h3>

<h3>China and the U.S. Establish a Gold and Silver Exchange Agreement</h3>
<p>Purchasing Gold and Storing It in America to Stabilize Finance - Another Step Forward in Cooperation Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[Washington] The negotiations between U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau and Chinese Finance Minister H.H. Kung have concluded, and a joint communiqué was issued today stating: "The governments of China and the the United States have now reached an agreement whereby the Chinese government will purchase a large amount of gold from the U.S. Treasury Department. In order to assist the Chinese government in accumulating gold reserves, the U.S. government will also continue to purchase silver from the Chinese government in accordance with the Silver Purchase Act of 1934. The U.S. government will also expand the measures by which the Central Bank of China purchases U.S. dollars to stabilize foreign exchange, under conditions that protect the interests of both countries." The gold purchased by China will still be stored in the the United States for China's financial stabilization plan. Morgenthau also explained that this agreement signifies a closer financial relationship between the two countries and has indirect benefits for the Anglo-American-French monetary agreement. Minister Kung stated that China does not lack foreign exchange but wishes to have more gold than silver in its reserve amounts. It does not matter where these reserves are stored, so it is willing to store the purchased gold in New York. Kung also stated that China's legal tender is backed by 60% cash and 40% treasury bonds. Neither he nor Secretary Morgenthau were willing to announce the total amount of gold purchased to avoid speculation and affecting world gold prices. Morgenthau and Kung then explained the results of last year's U.S. purchase of silver from China, stating: "This matter has benefited both countries due to the agreement reached between the Chinese and U.S. governments last year and is very satisfactory. We are particularly pleased that our cooperation has taken another step forward. Since the implementation of China's currency reform plan and financial stabilization policy, remarkable achievements have been made. Trade between China and the the United States has also seen great development, with the the United States being China's largest trading partner. All of this is welcome to us." Secretary Morgenthau finally expressed his deep gratitude to the Chinese government and people for sending Minister Kung to the the United States in person to negotiate, resulting in today's achievements. Kung finally told reporters that it would be easy for China to borrow from abroad if it wanted to. When asked if the gold purchased by China from the the United States was a loan, Kung replied that this gold was for reserve purposes and that China could seek elsewhere if it wanted to borrow. The discussions with the the United States have now concluded, but he will stay in Washington for one more day tomorrow. Kung today accompanied Chinese Ambassador to the the United States Wang Zhengting to Mount Vernon to lay a wreath at Washington's tomb and bow three times before visiting Washington's former residence and gardens. (National Telegraph of the 9th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau announced that the gold that the the United States should sell comes from two sources: one is the original gold in the the United States that has been nationalized by the Treasury Department, and the other is the excess gold imported into the the United States from foreign countries. Financial circles in the the United States welcomed the new agreement between China and the the United States, saying that the U.S. Treasury has a lot of gold reserves, and some of them cannot be produced, which can be alleviated in the future.

<h3>Joint Declaration by Chinese and American Finance Ministers</h3>
<p>[Washington] After the final talks between Dr. H.H. Kung, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, and US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. yesterday, both parties issued a joint declaration to the press, stating that the monetary cooperation established in May 1936 between representatives of the US Treasury and the Chinese Ministry of Finance has greatly contributed to the smooth implementation of China's new currency system. This has benefited both the Chinese domestic economy and US trade. We can now announce that the monetary cooperation between China and the United States will be further advanced to continue the understanding reached a year ago. We believe that the monetary policy pursued by the Chinese National Government is not only based on a sound foundation but also an important step towards the goal of global currency stability. To increase our efforts to achieve this goal and to maintain cooperation in currency reform and currency stabilization, and in accordance with our silver purchase policy, we have resolutely expressed our willingness to purchase a large amount of silver from the Central Bank of China under mutually acceptable conditions, and to enable the Central Bank of China to obtain US dollars to stabilize the currency under conditions that protect the interests of both China and the United States. We firmly believe that the new plan for currency reform adopted by the Chinese government and the measures agreed upon with the United States are sufficient to guarantee the stability of the Chinese currency and thereby promote the improvement and prosperity of China's national economy. Both parties have agreed that the Chinese government will purchase a large amount of gold from the United States to help the Chinese government increase its gold reserves, and in accordance with the US Silver Purchase Act of 1934, the US Treasury will continue to purchase silver from the Chinese government. The US Treasury also intends to expand the scope of the measures previously agreed upon, namely, the conditions under which the Central Bank of China can obtain US dollars to stabilize its currency while protecting the interests of both China and the United States. The Finance Ministers of China and the United States are deeply satisfied with the results that benefit both countries. This result is due to the understanding reached between the two countries last year. Both China and the United States are especially pleased to announce further cooperation between the two countries. The reform of China's currency system and the stability of its currency have been a great success. Consequently, China's trade with other countries, especially with the United States, which ranks first in China's international trade, has increased. The current talks have come to an end. The US Treasury Secretary is sincerely pleased to have had the opportunity to personally contact the Chinese Finance Minister and discuss the promotion of the well-being of both countries. It is reported that during the Sino-American talks, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, the Director of the Bureau of International Trade, Guo Bingwen, and experts from the US Treasury Department were present.

<h3>Palestine</h3>

Therefore, the Secretariat has asked the Council members to send written statements before July 15 stating whether they agree that the Permanent Mandates Commission should issue a temporary opinion and that the issue should be returned to the Mandates Commission for discussion after the Council meets in September, without any obstacles. Before the report is submitted to the Mandates Commission, both houses of the British Parliament will likely debate it. As it stands, the majority of members of the House of Commons support the plan to divide Palestine into three parts. Although the details will certainly be debated fiercely, many see this as the only practical solution to the problem. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Jerusalem Today, some people interviewed King Abdullah of Transjordan, asking for his opinion on the British Committee's report. Abdullah said that the recommendations in the report are the best solution to the Palestine issue under the current circumstances. It is understood that Abdullah is one of the four Arab kings, the other three being the King of Saudi Arabia, King Ghazi of Iraq, and Imam of Yemen. It is also understood that the report recommends that Arab land in Palestine should be merged with Transjordan as far as possible. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Signing of the Franco-German Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Trade Based on Most-Favored-Nation Status Effective Next Month with a Term of Two Years</p>
<p>[Paris] The Franco-German trade negotiations, which have been going on for several months, have recently been declared concluded, and both parties have reached a trade agreement. Its contents are: ⑴ The trade agreement is based on the most-favored-nation clause. ⑵ The goods price settlement agreement will abolish the current barter system and replace it with the usual international method. Regarding this point, the number of French exports to Germany has been small in the past due to Germany's large debt on goods prices, but it can now be restored to its original state. In addition, France and Germany will organize a joint committee to hold regular meetings so that the goods price settlement method can be kept in balance and there will be no more arrears. As for the principal and interest of the Dawes and Young loans, they should still be paid in accordance with the current methods. (It is noted that Germany has reduced the interest rate on the Dawes loan from 7.5% to 5%, and plans to reduce the interest rate on the Young loan from 5% to 4.5%). Furthermore, a solution has also been agreed upon for the problem of the transfer of French claims against Germany. The above two agreements will take effect on August 1st, with a valid period of two years. (Havas dispatch, 10th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Franco-German trade treaty was signed today at the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs by French Foreign Minister Delbos and Ambassador Welczek. The treaty will take effect on August 1st for a term of two years. After the new treaty is signed, the trade agreement signed in 1934 will be declared invalid. The new treaty includes a list of goods enjoying customs privileges in the trade between the two countries, as well as most-favored-nation treatment clauses. There are also regulations regarding the quota of German goods imported into France. The treaty restores the situation before 1934. As for German imports from France, Germany will receive a large supply of raw materials. Under the goods agreement, the exchange of French iron ore and German cork, as well as France's supply of colonial timber to Germany, are specifically noted. The relations between other French colonies and Germany will also be resolved based on most-favored-nation treatment. As for repayments, they will be based on foreign currency.

<h3>France Decides to Abolish Border Monitoring of Spain</h3>
<p>But Contraband Will Still Not Be Allowed Through The UK Continues to Mediate with Various Countries</p>
<p>[Paris] Official circles have recently announced that the French government will notify the London Adjustment Committee on the 12th of this month that the current international monitoring measures at the French-Spanish border should be terminated from the 13th. However, all items prohibited by the Adjustment Committee will still not be allowed to be transported to Spain. In addition, the obligations accepted by France in accordance with the Non-Intervention Agreement will remain in effect. It is noted that this method is temporary in nature and will be revoked once the conditions proposed by French representative Couve de Murville at the plenary meeting of the Adjustment Committee yesterday are met. (Havas dispatch, 10th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] After the British government accepted the entrustment of the Adjustment Committee to find a compromise solution between the British and French monitoring plans and the German and Italian counter-proposals, Foreign Secretary Eden has separately ordered British envoys stationed in various European countries to immediately inquire about the opinions of the governments of those countries. At the same time, Foreign Secretary Eden will also hold talks with the envoys of various countries stationed in the UK. It is generally known that the purpose of the UK's inquiry is to first reach an agreement on the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries, and then it is hoped that other issues can be resolved through compromise. Afterwards, it is planned to apply to both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War, so that each party will allow international monitors to carry out their duties in Spanish ports. If this method cannot become a reality, then another maritime monitoring plan may be proposed, and neutral countries will be invited to participate. (Havas dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Non-Intervention Committee Asks UK to Continue Mediation</h3>
<p>Debate Between French, Russian, German and Italian Representatives UK Representative Also Makes Blunt Remarks</p>
<p>[London] The maritime monitoring plan of the Non-Intervention Committee for the Spanish Civil War has reached a stalemate because Germany and Italy withdrew, leaving a void, and Germany and Italy opposed the filling of the void by the British and French navies. The committee has now entrusted the UK to take on the responsibility of mediation. Today, the plenary meeting of the Non-Intervention Committee passed the Dutch Minister's proposal to entrust the Chairman of the Committee, Plymouth, to find a way to break the current stalemate. During the meeting, the French Ambassador stated that if the balance of the monitoring plan could not be maintained for a long time, France would stop the international monitoring in the Pyrenees region. However, no applicable mediation method has yet been proposed. While the UK and France insisted on their original positions, Germany and Italy insisted on granting the rights of belligerents to the Spanish Nationalist forces and issued extremely harsh comments to the British government. Chairman Plymouth stated at the meeting today that the UK found it difficult to accept the criticisms from the outside world, because if all countries could abide by the letter and spirit of the Non-Intervention Agreement as consistently as the UK, then the situation in Spain today would not be like this. Therefore, the failure of the four countries to cooperate today is not the fault of the UK. The urgent task at present is how to re-establish the second line of defense in the monitoring plan. Furthermore, the withdrawal of volunteers is very important in the eyes of Europe and the world. If this matter cannot be resolved, then the resolution of the Spanish question will also be almost impossible. Plymouth also said that almost none of the speeches by the representatives of the various countries were constructive. If any country can propose a method that is more practical than the new British and French plan, the UK would be willing to consider it. However, as it stands, if a spirit of cooperation cannot be achieved, then a resolution will also be impossible. But if the UK takes on the responsibility of mediation, then speed is of the essence. The representatives of Germany, Italy and France each declared that they would continue to maintain the attitude they had expressed. The Soviet Ambassador declared his support for the British and French position, while the Portuguese Ambassador said that the Portuguese government was willing to respect any satisfactory resolution. Following the unanimous approval of the General Assembly, the UK was asked to take on the responsibility of mediation. Mr. Plymouth said that the British government deeply understood the seriousness of the current situation, so if a good outcome was to be achieved in this matter, all related countries must provide the maximum possible cooperation. Finally, it was decided to convene another meeting at the earliest possible date next week so that the results of the British government's efforts could be reported to the General Assembly. Furthermore, London believes that the negotiations have not broken down, and now the good results of the meeting far exceeded what was expected at the beginning of the meeting. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The delegations of various countries believe that the atmosphere was once tense after the speech delivered by the Italian representative Grandi this morning, but now the situation has greatly improved. According to the previous telegram, the first part of Grandi's speech has been detailed, and the last part mentioned the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers from various countries, saying that the withdrawal of volunteers may not shorten the Spanish Civil War, and the Italian government is not willing to let its people, who have sacrificed their lives for their beliefs, abandon them. He concluded by saying that Italy is determined to limit the scope of the Spanish Civil War and not allow it to expand, and will uphold the policy of non-intervention. Subsequently, the Portuguese representative Monteiro spoke, saying that if the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War could recognize them as belligerents, it would greatly enhance the effectiveness of the non-intervention measures. The Soviet representative Maisky then spoke, firmly rejecting the counter-proposals put forward by Germany and Italy and fully supporting the British and French monitoring plan, and said that the Spanish maritime monitoring plan was the main factor in the non-intervention measures. "In summary, the Spanish Civil War is a disguised war by Germany and Italy against the legitimate government of Spain." Subsequently, the German representative Ribbentrop delivered a speech, fiercely criticizing the attitude adopted by the Soviet Union and involving the role of the Comintern before and after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Regarding the British and French monitoring plan, he said that since his country did not recognize the Spanish Nationalist government, the plan lacked the spirit of neutrality. As for the argument that recognizing the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents would only benefit the Nationalist forces, it was also inaccurate. "Furthermore, the Adjustment Committee should not handle the issue of the Spanish Civil War with preconceived notions, favoring one side and hating the other." He concluded by saying that Germany and Italy do not want a communist regime to be established in Spain, and few other countries would support it. Subsequently, the representatives of other countries successively expressed their opinions, all supporting the plans proposed by the UK and France, but at the same time hoping to find a way to satisfy all the countries concerned. The British representative, Lord Plymouth, spoke last, refuting the German and Italian representatives' claim that the UK was biased, and also said that the British and French monitoring plan advocated that neutral personnel should board monitoring warships to inspect them. This was to ensure the faithful implementation of the monitoring measures. As for the proposal put forward by Germany and Italy to recognize the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents, it could not be used to replace the monitoring plan, so the UK was not in a position to accept it. The UK agreed with the French position. (Havas dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hitler Convenes Meeting</h3>
<p>Göring and Neurath Were Both Called to Participate</p>
<p>[Berlin] Political figures here are taking a reserved attitude towards the results of yesterday's plenary meeting of the London Adjustment Committee and are unwilling to comment. Hitler has decided to convene an emergency meeting in Berchtesgaden today, which will be attended by Air Minister Göring and Foreign Minister Neurath. It is noted that Hitler always announces his important decisions on Saturdays and Sundays, and today is also Saturday, so it is not known whether a major historical event will occur. Although Hitler's aides have denied this, it should be known that Hitler has never been willing to adopt the opinions of his aides. It is noted that yesterday the chairman of the London Adjustment Committee, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Plymouth, issued a statement publicly opposing the counter-proposals put forward by Germany and Italy. The UK is eager for the Spanish issue to be resolved quickly on the basis of the British and French understanding. Although the German representative, Ambassador to the UK Ribbentrop, issued a statement at the meeting, it was still rejected. Furthermore, the news about the Adjustment Committee meeting published in today's newspapers, in which the statement made by Plymouth was all censored, only stated that the German representative Ribbentrop "vehemently refuted" the Soviet representative Maisky. The implication is that if the Soviet representative attends the Adjustment Committee again, Hitler will threaten to withdraw from the Adjustment Committee, which is quite noteworthy. (Havas dispatch, 10th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The Führer Hitler has convened Air Minister General Göring and Foreign Minister Neurath to hold important talks in Berchtesgaden tomorrow. General Göring was originally scheduled to deliver a speech in Stuttgart tomorrow, but it has now been canceled. German political figures said that the foreign newspapers' sensational speculations about the talks between Führer Hitler and Göring, Neurath, etc. are all untrue. (Central News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] The German official news agency published an article stating that, according to the authorities, Foreign Minister Neurath's current reporting to London would be of no benefit. It is noted that British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech in London a few days ago that he deeply regretted that the changes in the overall situation had caused Neurath to postpone his visit to the UK, and hoped that there would be an opportunity in the future for both parties to discuss and bring their opinions closer together. The news agency published the above after the British Prime Minister's speech. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Lansbury Visits Italian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Wearing a White Belt with "Peace" Written on It</p>
<p>[Rome] British Labour MP Lansbury, who had previously visited US President Roosevelt, German Führer Hitler, and politicians from France and the Scandinavian countries to conduct private talks on the "economic causes" of war, arrived here yesterday to pay his respects to Prime Minister Mussolini. The meeting lasted three quarters of an hour before it ended. He also made a statement to the newspapers, saying that the most important thing discussed was his proposal to convene a defense conference to study the economic methods to solve political difficulties. He will also visit the Prime Minister again on Monday or Tuesday. When asked whether the impression he got after meeting with Mussolini was the same as after visiting the German Führer Hitler, he said "The two are completely different." (Havas dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Rome] British Labour MP Lansbury arrived in Rome today and was immediately received by Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Count Ciano. The three held talks in English for forty-five minutes. It is noted that Mr. Lansbury traveled a long distance in the hot weather, and immediately after arriving in Rome, he drove to the Venice Palace. Mr. Lansbury was wearing a white belt with the word "Peace" written on it and was holding a felt hat. He was led up the Guan stairs and into the marble grand hall to meet with Mr. Mussolini. Upon arriving there, infantrymen with skulls and crossbones painted on their chests drew their swords and saluted. Mr. Lansbury served as Minister of Labour in the MacDonald Labour Cabinet from June 1929 to August 1931. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops' Surprise Attack on Wanping: The Course of Events</h3>
<p>Japanese troops requested to enter the city late at night to search for a missing soldier; our troops immediately and sternly refused due to its unreasonableness; Japanese troops attacked several times and reinforced Fengtai.</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch, Morning of the 8th: The 29th Army stationed at Lugouqiao in Wanping was suddenly attacked by Japanese troops. The situation became extremely serious for a time. The causes and effects of the incident are described below.</p>
<p>Remote Cause of the Incident</p>
<p>Since the 29th Army was unreasonably forced by Japanese troops to withdraw from Fengtai last year, it has been stationed on the banks of the Yongding River in Wanping County. One battalion and three companies of infantry from Feng Zhi'an's 37th Division are stationed inside and outside the city. The area is more than 30 li from Beiping, 7 li from Fengtai, and about 3 li from Lugouqiao. It is located at the intersection of the Pinghan, Pingsui, and Beining railways, and occupies a strategic position. The Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai have repeatedly demanded that the authorities withdraw the troops stationed there and cede Changxindian because Commander Feng's troops are stationed there. Our side immediately refused. Last winter, in order to expand the Fengtai barracks and increase the number of troops stationed there, the Japanese side planned to build a military fortress between Lugouqiao, Changxindian, and Wanping County, to serve as a strategic point for the troops stationed in Fengtai and to facilitate monitoring of our troops stationed in Wanping and along the Yongding River. Later, due to public opposition, people requested the authorities to negotiate and stop this plan. The Japanese side's wishes were not fulfilled. However, the Japanese side never stopped dreaming of realizing this plan.</p>
<p>Pretext for the Conflict</p>
<p>In the past week, the Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai, the troops of Kaita and Ichiki, two major detachments of cavalry and infantry, have been conducting exercises and demonstrations near Lugouqiao every day. Our troops have been tolerant and have not engaged them. On the evening of the 7th, one company of Kaita's troops again conducted night combat exercises at Lugouqiao. After the exercise, a roll call revealed that one outpost cavalryman was missing. According to the Japanese side's subsequent statement, they suddenly heard a gunshot from inside Wanping County. Using this as a pretext, they claimed that the troops stationed in Wanping County had fired at Japanese soldiers, and that the missing soldier had been killed by our side. Therefore, they requested to enter the city for a search. Our troops refused because it was midnight and all the residents were asleep, fearing that a disturbance would disrupt public order. Matsui, the head of the Japanese military intelligence agency stationed in Beiping, based on Kaita's report, telephoned Qin Dechun, requesting him to order Wanping County to open the city gates. He also replied with the aforementioned reasons. Subsequently, Matsui telephoned Qin again, saying that if the Japanese troops were not allowed to enter the city, they would send an armed guard team into the city. At the same time, the Wanping County garrison and the commissioner's office also telephoned Qin, reporting that the Japanese troops had increased to four or five hundred and were encircling Wanping County, hoping for a quick negotiation to stop the attack. Qin then notified Matsui, requesting that he quickly send personnel to assist the Jicha Council to send people to investigate and dissuade. Matsui then sent his deputy agency chief Terahira, the commander of the First Infantry Regiment stationed in Beiping, Kurumaguch, the Japanese military advisor to the Jicha Council, Sakurai, the Wanping commissioner Wang Lengqi, the Jicha Committee Councilor Lin Gengyu, the Jicha Transportation Committee Councilor Sun Yongye, and others to the scene of the incident by car.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Encirclement and Attack</p>
<p>After Terahira arrived, he abandoned his investigation mission and, on behalf of Kaita, reiterated the previous demands. While they were arguing, gunfire suddenly erupted at the east gate, and cannon fire began at the west gate, mixed with machine gun fire. Our defending troops initially tried their best to remain calm. However, seeing that the pressure from the other side was gradually increasing and the artillery fire was becoming denser, they bravely resisted. The two sides fought until about nine o'clock, when the gunfire began to subside. About one platoon of our troops stationed near the Dragon King Temple at Lugouqiao failed to retreat and were disarmed by the Japanese troops. After the conflict subsided slightly, our side inspected the casualties and found that there were more than 20 dead and wounded. The Japanese side had more than 10 dead and wounded, including a squad leader. At this time, the authorities in both Beiping and Tianjin had learned of the incident and contacted each other by telephone, ordering their respective troops to stop the attack. However, the Japanese troops lay down in skirmish lines in the bushes on the banks of the Shuiding River, waiting for an opportunity. Mutaguchi demanded that our troops stationed in Wanping immediately withdraw, and that the troops on the banks of the Yongding River must also withdraw. We refused. At 11:30, the negotiations still yielded no results, and the conflict resumed. However, it stopped shortly afterwards, and negotiations continued. The Japanese side's demands remained the same. However, they had already stated that the missing soldier had returned to the team and stopped talking about the 29th Army shooting their soldiers. They only acknowledged that the 29th Army had engaged in anti-Japanese behavior and must withdraw. We insisted that the Japanese troops must return to their original defense positions before other matters could be discussed. The negotiations ultimately broke down. At 3:00 PM, the conflict broke out again. It stopped again at 3:30 PM. Mutaguchi then issued an ultimatum to Wang Lengqi and the troops stationed in Wanping City, demanding that they withdraw by 6:00 PM, or they would launch a large-scale attack. We ignored the ultimatum. Until 6:00 PM, the Japanese side did not take much action. At around 8:00 PM, gunfire resumed. The situation afterwards was unclear. It was reported that Zhang Zizhong had rushed to the scene of the incident by car at 10:00 PM to investigate and planned to find a way to prevent the escalation of the situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Reinforce</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Japanese Army Headquarters stationed in Tianjin convened an emergency meeting at 6:00 AM on the 8th. Since Tashiro was ill, Hashimoto took over as chairman and invited senior officers to discuss the matter. They then sent the first section chief Wachi and staff officer Adachi to Beiping by car to negotiate with Qin Dechun in cooperation with Matsui. At the same time, more than 300 Japanese infantry soldiers drove to Wanping in heavy-duty trucks to reinforce the troops. More than 50 logistical troops then requisitioned a special train on the Beining Railway at about 1:00 PM to transport a large number of weapons and ammunition to Fengtai for transfer to the front. They later planned to send more troops and requisitioned a train on the Beining Railway. The railway refused. Director Chen Juesheng also ordered all railway staff that, under these circumstances, they could not allocate trains for the Japanese side. Therefore, as of the evening of the 8th, no more Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin had been dispatched. There are currently more than 1,000 Japanese troops stationed in Fengtai, more than 1,000 in Tongzhou, and more than 800 in Beiping. Our troops stationed in Beiping, Tongzhou, Lugouqiao, and Changxindian amount to approximately two brigades and three regiments. The Japanese brigade commander Kawabe is currently in Fengtai, and the regimental commander Mutaguchi is outside Wanping City. This situation of confrontation and conflict seemed to have intensified into the night. The Japanese Army Department stationed in Tianjin was still holding a meeting at Haiguang Temple at midnight.</p>
<p>Traffic Situation</p>
<p>On the morning of the 8th, long-distance telephone communication between Beiping and Tianjin was interrupted once, but it was restored at 6:00 AM. However, due to the excessive number of callers throughout the day, it was difficult to transmit messages. The passenger trains on the Beining Railway from Beiping to Tianjin were not obstructed in the morning. However, the third, fifth, and third trains of the third day were delayed by about an hour because the 29th Army was inspecting travelers near Yongdingmen to prevent spies from taking the opportunity to infiltrate and cause disturbances. After 9:00 AM, it was reported that a section of the railway tracks near Fengtai had been deliberately dismantled by our troops to prevent enemy troops from attacking. The passenger trains from Tianjin to Beiping, except for one that arrived in Beiping at 2:00 PM, all arrived in Huangcun first, waiting for a telephone call from Fengtai to confirm that there were no obstacles before proceeding. However, upon reaching Fengtai, they were prevented from entering Beiping City by the front line and were all turned back from Fengtai. Passengers did not disembark. At 8:00 PM on the evening of the 8th, Beiping was placed under martial law. Feng Zhi'an, Shao Wenkai, and Chen Jiyan were appointed as deputy commanders of martial law. All city gates were closed, leaving only Zhengyangmen open for entry and exit. The inspection of pedestrians was very strict. After Song Zheyuan received the news in Leling, in addition to reporting to the central government, he ordered Men Zhizhong, the chairman of the Jicha Construction Committee who was going to see him, to return to Beiping at noon on the 8th to convey his intentions to Qin Dechun and others. At that time, senior officers of the 29th Army, Zhang Zizhong and Feng Zhi'an, were in Beiping presiding over everything. Although the atmosphere was extremely tense between Tianjin and Beiping, people were not agitated.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Demonstrate</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the afternoon of the 8th, more than 30 armored vehicles, more than 10 tanks, and hundreds of infantry and artillery soldiers from the Japanese Army stationed in Tianjin were divided into two groups and paraded along Dajing Road in Hebei, Tianjin, and Jintang Road in the Special No. 2 District. The road surface was damaged by the tanks. The parade lasted for a while before returning to camp. At noon, three Japanese military aircraft converted from Huitong circled over the city of Tianjin, and soon flew along the Beining Railway towards Fengtai. From the attitude of the Japanese Army Headquarters here, it is clear that the Japanese side is eager to occupy the area and has the ambition to do so. However, the 29th Army's serious attitude and fierce resistance were far beyond the Japanese side's expectations. (8th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Commencement of Reconstruction of the Four City Gates</p>
<p>The city's road expansion plan is being actively promoted. The Lou, Qi, Pan, and Wu four city gates will be reconstructed starting on the 10th and will be completed in approximately three months. The widening of Hulong Street, Lindun Road, and Qimen Road, the main roads, is scheduled to begin on the 11th. Additionally, 13 bridges of various sizes are scheduled to be reconstructed simultaneously on the 21st, using steel and concrete. The buildings on both sides of the main roads must be demolished and vacated by the 15th.</p>
<p>Parricide Case Occurs in Suzhou Village</p>
<p>Zhang Bingchu, a farmer from Dazhaiji Village, Jinshu, Suzhou Township, died suddenly on June 27th. At the time, the deceased's sons, Renjun and Junwan, and the deceased's younger brother, Zhang Huichu, all claimed that he had died by hanging and did not report it for investigation. After the burial, rumors spread in the village that he had been murdered by his two sons and brother. Therefore, the local police station detained Zhang Huichu, Zhang Renjun, and Zhang Junwan and sent them to the city for interrogation by the district procuratorate. On the 10th, the police dispatched officers to transport the coffin to the city. Prosecutor Zhang and inspector Xuan Fang opened the coffin outside the North Gate in the afternoon to examine the body. The examination revealed that there were many wounds on the body. The coroner's report was filled out and submitted for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Further Details on the Gunfight Between Police and Bandits</p>
<p>Following the tragic gunfight and bloodshed between police and bandits that occurred at Renshou Lane, Gongyun Bridge, on the afternoon of the 7th, the injured were sent to Tongren and Xiongdi hospitals for treatment. According to the bandit Zhang Songda, the shooting of police officer Ni Abing and others was accidental. The bandit is now in critical condition and may develop peritonitis, putting his life in danger. The four people who were injured by the bandits, Ni Abing, Liu Changfa, Wang Taoshi, and Wu Zhongyi, are in better condition and should recover without major complications. The four suspects arrested by the county police bureau, Wang Heshang, Gao Asan, Zou Qiaoyun, and Wang Agen, have been taken into custody for investigation.</p>
<p>Wheat Boat Robbed in Wuxi</p>
<p>Yu Jifeng Rice Shop in Gaoshengzhen, Yixing, hired a barge owned by Jiang Rushan on the 6th of this month, loaded with 180 dan of wheat, to be transported to Yuanchang Rice Shop in Sanliqiao, Wuxi, for unloading. As it was getting late when they arrived at the Beixinqiao area near Luoshe, Wuxi, they anchored there for the night. They continued sailing at 4:00 AM the next morning. Unexpectedly, when they reached Gaomingqiao, more than 30 li from the city, they were suddenly attacked by a pirate ship. More than a dozen pirates, each wielding a broadsword, jumped onto the wheat boat, tied up Jiang Rushan and his son with ropes, and forbade them from making any noise. They ransacked the boat at will. After about an hour, they escaped with the loot towards Changzhou. After the incident, it was discovered that more than 70 dan of wheat had been robbed, resulting in a loss of more than 600 yuan. On the 9th, Jiang Rushan, the boat owner, reported the incident to the county police bureau, requesting the arrest of the robbers and the recovery of the stolen goods.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Linhai Wheat Exports</p>
<p>In Linhai City, merchants are buying up all available wheat, regardless of quantity, causing the price of wheat to rise. It is reported that the wheat buyers are reselling to a certain party. In the past three or four days, approximately 4,000 bags of wheat have been loaded and exported. There has been a lot of rain this summer, which has damaged the early rice crop. The large-scale export of wheat is causing concern about the food supply for the people.</p>
<h3>Huaiyin</h3>
<p>Planning to Build a New Electric Light Plant</p>
<p>The electric light plant established by the Jiangsu Construction Department in Huaiyin is operating very successfully. Because the original plant site has no room for expansion, a new plant is being planned in Zhongzhou under Qingjiang Dam. A staff member has been sent to Shanghai to negotiate for larger machinery that can supply more than 10,000 light bulbs to meet the demand. It is reported that the new plant site has been leveled, and the construction project has been contracted to Lu Shengji for 22,000 yuan. The funds will be provided by the province, and construction is scheduled to begin in late June and be completed by the end of November this year.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Transfer of County Police Officers for Training</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Police Academy's current class of police officers and cadets is about to graduate. It is reported that the Department of Civil Affairs will transfer existing police officers from various counties to the province for training, in accordance with the department's order. No new police officer students will be recruited. The cadet class will also transfer existing senior police officers from various counties to the province for training.</p>

They can also help with the literacy campaign. The security team can help the township head organize the Baojia system and train the young men, so that the security team can become integrated with the rural community. To achieve this goal, I think that after the young men complete their three-month training, they should be incorporated into the security team for in-service training. After one year, they should be discharged and become a reserve force. This will not only ensure that the young men's training is effective, but also create a close relationship between the security team and the local community. At the same time, it will also lay the groundwork for the implementation of the conscription system. Secondly, Guangdong has many barren mountains. Guangdong is not only experiencing a rice shortage, but also a serious fuel problem. We in Guangdong only know how to cut down trees and do not know how to plant them. If this continues, we will eventually run out of fuel. If we do not plan for this early, it will be terrible in the future. Therefore, the afforestation movement is also a major urgent task in Guangdong. Afforestation can not only solve Guangdong's fuel problem, but also prevent droughts and floods. Now that the Guangdong Provincial Paper Mill is about to start production, it will need a lot of wood every day after it starts production. Therefore, this problem is a very serious one. We must plan for it in advance. Therefore, our government is now preparing to create a provincial-level afforestation plan for all localities. We need what kind of wood, and we will plant what kind of forest throughout the province. After the plan is drafted, we will implement this work. We also want our security team to participate directly. Currently, we have 41 security teams in the province, totaling nearly 20,000 people, distributed throughout the province. In addition to retaining a portion to maintain local autonomy, the rest can be rotated out to do some local business, such as training young men, reclaiming wasteland for afforestation, and helping the people build simple flood control projects, etc.</p>
<p>As I just said, I want to use the schools in each county as the center of our rural construction movement. But we are afraid that there are many villages in each county that do not have schools, or even if they do, they are poorly organized and the knowledge and abilities of the principals and teachers are very shallow, which is not enough to take on this responsibility. There are originally 13,998 townships and 784 towns in Guangdong Province. Now we are abolishing the district system and changing it to a joint township autonomy system. After the joint township autonomy system is changed, all townships will be reduced in size. As a result of the reduction, from 13,998 townships, there will be 4,846 townships, and from 748 towns, there will be 263 towns. One township is a small unit. Guangdong has 4,846 townships, which means there are 4,846 units. Averaging 97 counties, each county has an average of more than 400 townships. In other words, a county government has to command more than 400 units. If there is no organization in the unit, or the organization is not sound, if there is a very sound school in this unit at this time, this school can serve as a consultant and guide for a town or township. However, according to the investigation by the Education Department, not all counties, towns, and townships have schools. Even if there are schools, they are very simple and cannot afford this important task. Therefore, I came up with a remedial measure. This remedial measure is that I want to recruit students who have passed the junior high school level in this province, train them for six months, nine months, or one year (the length of time will be determined based on the amount of courses), and instill in them various necessary simple knowledge and skills, such as local self-government cooperation, afforestation, water conservancy, and military training. It is planned to recruit 500 to 1,000 people. After completing the training, they will be assigned to various counties to serve. Each person must be responsible for completing several tasks in a few months, or holding them in stages. Assuming each stage is one month, in the first three months, they must lead the villagers to organize the township office. In the second three months, they must organize the Baojia system in each township, or organize the cooperative. We will give him a specific job and ask him to complete it in stages. If we can have schools as the center, security teams to participate, and supplement rural construction workers, and assign them to each county and township in the province to help us work together, we may be able to achieve considerable results in the rural construction movement within three years and cultivate the foundation of the rural economy. If we can achieve results, the people will definitely be very happy and follow us in our efforts. If we continue like this, ten years later, the rural construction movement in Guangdong Province will definitely be able to show some achievements.</p>
<p>The problem I am raising today is indeed a very important and urgent one. Now that the funding is secured and the plan is about to be drafted, the current problem lies only in the people, that is, how to mobilize them. This problem is how to use people, how to train them, and how to organize them. Therefore, I am raising this problem today, and I am also providing my personal opinions for your reference. I hope that you will discuss it in detail and jointly formulate a plan so that the rural construction movement in Guangdong Province can achieve good results because of the promotion of capable personnel.

<h3>Messages from Lushan Amidst the Thorough Investigation of the Yarn Exchange Case</h3>
<p>Yu Zhiqing said it should not be expanded, but there should be results. The staff sent by the Ministry of Industry to Shanghai to investigate have returned to Nanjing to report.</p>
<p>Kuling Dispatch</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Kuling, 10th: After the speculation wave in the Shanghai yarn market occurred, the government and society paid close attention to it. Shanghai business leaders Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, and Mu Ouchu were summoned to Lushan one after another. The reporter interviewed Mr. Mu and Mr. Yu separately. According to Mr. Yu, the current business situation in Shanghai is that it is not easy for businessmen to pay 100,000 or 80,000 in cash. The checks in this speculation wave are as high as hundreds of thousands or millions. Without great strength, how could this be achieved? In this time of national crisis, this type of situation should not be expanded, but the investigation should not be without results. According to Mr. Mu, the manipulators of this yarn wave are not the bulls but the bears. His personal position is related to the broker, and the broker is related to the client, so it is impossible to investigate clearly. After arriving in Lushan on the morning of the 10th, Yu Qiaqing was received by Chairman Chiang at 11:00, who inquired about the situation of the yarn exchange speculation wave. Mr. Yu reported in detail and asked for instructions on everything. He left the mountain at noon to Xunn, took a boat to return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai News</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's thorough investigation of the Shanghai Yarn Exchange speculation wave was handled by Minister Wu himself, leading his staff to Shanghai. The case has now been submitted to the court for investigation. In addition to Minister Wu, who has already returned to Nanjing to report to President Chiang, Councilor Chen Yu and General Affairs Director Yan Shenyu, who came with him, also returned to Nanjing yesterday afternoon to report. Kuang Yunwen, the first section chief of the Department of Commerce, is scheduled to return to Nanjing today. According to Chief Kuang yesterday, he was ordered to come to Shanghai to investigate the yarn exchange speculation wave because of his relationship with the responsible section. The case has been transferred to the court for handling according to law. He personally did not want to make any external statements. However, today (10th) I read in the newspaper that Vice Minister Zou's conversation with Mu Ouchu included Mu's reply that "Chief Kuang stated in court that there was no evidence against Wu Shenglin." According to the investigation results of the Ministry, all have been transferred to the court one after another. During the first court hearing, I attended and prepared a written statement. I don't know what Chairman Mu is referring to.</p>
<p>Minister of Finance Zou Lin and Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang paid a visit to President Chiang on the 6th to report on the Shanghai Yarn Exchange speculation wave and ask for instructions on everything.

<h3>Shanghai North Health Center Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Mayor Yu's wife cut the ribbon. Hu Hongji's bronze statue unveiled.</p>
<p>The Shanghai North Health Center of the Municipal Health Bureau held its opening ceremony at its location on Qingyun Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. At the same time, the bronze statue of former Health Bureau Director Hu Hongji, which was built inside the center, was also unveiled. The ceremony was very grand. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The center held its opening ceremony yesterday. Acting Mayor Yu, Xu Fu, Shen Yi, and Wang Xiaolai from the Chamber of Commerce (represented by Cao Zhigong), Yan Fuqing from the Red Cross Society, Pang Jingzhou, Weng Zhilong, the director of the Municipal Hospital, Yang Dean from the New Life Movement, Xu Xiaochu from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association, and more than 100 other people were present. Director Li and Center Director You Jihua and all the staff welcomed them at the scene. The opening ceremony began with Mrs. Acting Mayor Yu cutting the ribbon, followed by the chairman's opening speech, Director Li's report on the internal organization, and the unveiling of former Director Hu's bronze statue, which was built on the first floor of the center. Acting Mayor Yu removed the national flag covering the statue, and everyone bowed to express their respect. Finally, Director Li led the guests on a tour of the center, and the ceremony ended.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman and Acting Mayor Yu delivered an opening speech, stating that the Municipal Health Bureau originally planned to establish health centers in 17 districts throughout the city in order to promote health work throughout the city. However, due to the high cost and the lack of funds in the city treasury, it had to adopt a gradual approach. The Gaogiao and Wusong districts were established in the 18th year, the Hongwan district was established in November of the 22nd year, the Shanghai South district was established in January of the 23rd year, and the Shanghai North district covers a vast area with a dense population, with the largest number of working-class people. After the Songhu war disaster, various municipal affairs urgently need construction in order to achieve recovery. Health facilities such as epidemic prevention and health care are particularly urgent. Therefore, despite the extreme financial difficulties, a committee was established to organize and plan the construction. After years of effort and assistance from all walks of life, it was finally realized. Today, we are holding the opening ceremony, and we are very honored to have the guidance from all walks of life. At the same time, Mr. Hu Hongji, the former director, made outstanding contributions to the Health Bureau. Therefore, a bronze statue was specially built in the office building today. The unveiling ceremony is also held today for people to admire and remember.</p>
<p>Li's Report</p>
<p>Director Li Tingan then reported that, although the construction of the Shanghai North Health Center is limited by funding, the scale is not very large, but the building structure and internal equipment were carefully planned by the Public Works Bureau and adopted the latest styles. This office began its work in November last year. Internally, it is divided into four sections: the first section is responsible for documents, accounting, general affairs, drug delivery management, and health education; the second section is responsible for cleaning, sanitation, general hygiene, and meat inspection; the third section is responsible for maternal and child health, school health, and labor health; and the fourth section is responsible for life statistics, epidemic prevention and treatment, and a clinic is attached. This is the general situation of the organization. I hope that all sectors of society will give our colleagues in the bureau guidance and encouragement at any time.</p>
<p>Public Bathhouse</p>
<p>The center also has a public bathhouse to meet the needs of the common people. According to the bathhouse rules, the opening hours are from 3:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day. The fee is extremely low, 4 cents for men and 8 cents for women. Towels are self-provided, so there is no risk of spreading various diseases. In addition, the number of patients diagnosed by the center has reached 300 to 400 per day recently, and the number of citizens contacting or requesting matters from the center is increasing every day, which shows that the public has paid close attention to the center.</p>

<h3>Qin Dechun Cables Shanghai Denying Reorganization of Hebei-Chahar Political Council</h3>

A reply was received on the 9th, stating that it was purely a rumor. The original telegram stated: "To Brother Li Guang'an, Representative of the 29th Army in Shanghai, Your telegram of the [date] has been received. Regarding the rumors circulating about the reorganization of the Hebei-Chahar political situation, they are purely rumors and have no basis. I hereby reply by telegram.

<h3>Wu Tiecheng Responds Favorably to Moving Monument Funds to Support Border Defense</h3>

The original letter stated: "To Mr. Esheng, I arrived in Shanghai on the 4th, but due to the press of affairs and the diagnosis and treatment of dental ailments and a physical examination, I was occupied all day and unable to pay my respects immediately. I have now received your letter and am delighted to read its contents. I have been involved in Shanghai's municipal affairs for nearly six years and have accomplished little, and I feel remorseful. I previously heard that there were plans to raise funds to build a Tang Yin monument, but I strongly opposed it because I felt that I was unworthy. Later, I heard that it was changed to commemorate the four mayors, and I did not want to interfere in a matter that did not concern me. I now think of a better plan, which is to inject funds into border defense, to seek peace of mind for all. This is what I deeply desire. In addition to forwarding your views to the relevant parties and requesting that they be adopted immediately, I am also conveying my thoughts. I wish you peace. Wu Tiecheng, respectfully, July 9th."</p>

<h3>Representatives of Borderland Chieftains of Southwestern Ethnic Minorities Issue Declaration on Petition</h3>
<p>Hoping for Sincere Unity to Defend the Border, Letter Sent to Petitioning Chieftains to Inquire About the Original Intention</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that Gao Yuzhu, representative of the borderland chieftains of southwestern ethnic minorities, and Yu Jiecai, representative of the petitioning people, have been petitioning in Beijing since last year. The result has been very satisfactory after a year. They were originally planning to pack their bags and return to the south within days. However, suddenly there were nine people, including Li Zongbo, representative of the Lijiang Muli Tusi in Yunnan, stationed in Yunnan, who telegraphed the Central Government, denying that the petitioning event had occurred. The representatives believe that this matter concerns their personal reputation and has a significant impact on the happiness of the Yi and Miao people and the future of unity among all ethnic groups in the entire country. In order to prevent the outside world from misunderstanding the truth, in addition to specifically presenting the process to the Central Government and requesting punishment for the troublemakers, they also issued a declaration. The following is a special excerpt:</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted, It has been reported that nine people, including Li Zongbo, representative of the Lijiang Muli Tusi in Yunnan, stationed in Yunnan, are jealous of the representatives' successful petition in Beijing and the sympathy and attention of the Chinese people. They are even unwilling to consider the overall situation and are being exploited by others to falsely telegraph the Central Government, clarifying their denial, intending to provoke discord and with sinister motives, which is extremely sad. Our Central Government cherishes the suffering of the Yi and Miao people in the southwestern borderland and will surely discern the truth and handle this perverse behavior, regardless of the distance. The representatives need not discuss this matter. However, considering the tens of millions of Yi and Miao people in the southwestern borderland, located in the border areas of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces, where transportation is blocked, culture is backward, the government's reach is limited, and the Chinese people regard them as uncivilized, they are suffering from foreign aggression to the extreme. The representatives, standing as borderland Yi Tusi, have made righteous appeals and have spared no effort in running around for years to rescue them. The year before last, Chairman Jiang visited the southwest, and the Yi and Miao people deeply felt his kindness. The Tusi from various borderland areas were inspired by this and became more eager for governance. Therefore, they sent representatives to Beijing to petition, sincerely supporting the Central Government, requesting support for development, improving culture, and improving living conditions, hoping to unite sincerely with all ethnic groups in the country, defend the border, and revitalize the national ethnicity. The purpose is upright and the actions are open and aboveboard. From beginning to end, they have not borrowed the name of any agency, organization, or any local official, nor have they been directed or funded by any party. As evidenced by the petition documents signed and sealed by the Tusi from various borderland areas when the representatives first arrived in Beijing, it is clear that Pillar's family has received national favor for generations, succeeding as the Beisheng Tusi. Her late father, while alive, represented the 21 Tusi along the border, seeking the welfare of the border people. Wang Zhu inherited her father's ambition and did not feel discouraged because she was a weak woman. She dared not lag behind in going to justice. This time, she risked dangers to plead for the people. The sacrifice for the nation is the way to repay the country. Looking back on the past year, everything she has stated is from the perspective of the entire southwestern borderland issue, seeking the welfare of all the Yi and Miao people, and there is absolutely no selfishness. The Central Government has been planning and managing the southwestern borderland Yi and Miao issue as a whole, and there is no need for a general representative in name. If it is considered that the representatives came to Beijing to petition without the approval of the Yunnan Provincial Government, which is illegal, then the petitioning Tusi who signed and sealed the documents this time are from Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces, so it is impossible to submit them to the record one by one. There are differences in interests, and it is difficult to reach a consensus of opinions, which may cause obstacles and delay the opportunity. Moreover, the people of a democratic country have the right to express their opinions on national affairs as long as they do not intend to deprive public power, and freedom of speech cannot be restricted by anyone. The representatives were born as border people, stated border affairs, and the Central Government had the right to adopt and review them. The upper order was followed and each had their own responsibilities. What is the point of arguing about being responsible or irresponsible? Now that the petition has ended, the Central Government is planning and managing the southwestern borderland Yi and Miao issue. Many Chinese people have a deep understanding of this issue and are enthusiastically developing it. The representatives have been ordered to return to the south and will follow the policy shown by the Central Government and do their best to handle the propaganda, investigation, and educational work. All Yi and Miao people should strive to improve themselves, eliminate the past bad habits of self-seclusion, and strive to move forward. However, Li Zongbo and others are trying to satisfy their own selfish desires and deliberately obstructing and sabotaging, which is to attack the representatives, that is, to oppose the Central Government's intentions and prevent the development of the Chinese people. The representatives are fighting for the borderland Yi and Miao people, and they do not care about their personal gains or losses, but the impact on the overall situation and the future happiness of the Yi and Miao people is a source of infinite grief. Li Zongbo and others have different opinions on this petition, so why didn't they make a statement when the Central Government initially sent the full text of the petition to the relevant provincial governments for review? Even if it is said that the names of these people are not listed in the petition, it is known that the area of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Xikang is vast, there are many Tusi, and the situation is complicated, so it is difficult to sign and seal one by one, which is not allowed by the facts. However, if the petitioning opinions are correct, signing or not cannot be required to be perfect. Moreover, during the period when the representatives petitioned in Beijing, they submitted the petitioning situation to the Party Departments of Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Xikang, and Hunan provinces for review, and were instructed to review and approve them by the governments of Guizhou, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces. There are no omissions in the procedures. If there is anything untrue or incomplete, it should be remedied at that time. Now that things have passed, there is nothing to criticize. Suddenly there is this regressive and absurd telegram, which is nothing less than deliberately showing weakness and giving people an opportunity to take advantage of it. Also, the Tusi listed in the telegram are half relatives and friends of the representatives, and their interests are consistent. It is impossible to have this unconscious and presumptuous behavior. It is inevitable that Li Zongbo and others are falsely accusing. It has been verified that Li Zongbo claims to be a representative of the Muli Tusi, but Muli is under the jurisdiction of the Sichuan Provincial Government. Why is he stationed in Kunming instead of Chengdu? The Muli Tusi also sent representatives to Beijing to petition, and the representatives also provided a lot of assistance to them. It is also known that Li Zongbo is listed among the nine people in the telegram. Even if it is assumed to be true, can these few people represent all the Tusi in Yunnan and deny the petitioning actions of the representatives over the past year, or are all the Tusi Yi and Miao in the southwest completely unwilling to accept this petition and oppose the Central Government's intentions? All of these require the Central Government to thoroughly investigate. In short, the words and deeds of the representatives over the years have been understood by all parties, and the right and wrong of public opinion are in the hearts of the people. It cannot be far-fetched. The representatives have made efforts and do not seek merit, but only seek no faults. If the Central Government considers the representatives' petition to be illegal and guilty, please issue a strict order for punishment to warn the representatives. Otherwise, the Central Government should thoroughly investigate the crimes of Li Zongbo and others. It is the good fortune of the southwestern borderland Yi and Miao, and the future of the country depends on it. In addition to separately telegraphing the Central Government and the authorities of the southwestern provinces to request strict inspection and handling to show fairness, and to sending letters to the petitioning Tusi to inquire about the original intention and make corrections on their own, we pray for your understanding and are extremely grateful. This declaration is hereby made. Southwestern Yi and Miao Borderland Tusi Representative Gao Yuzhu, Southwestern Ethnic Minorities Petitioning People's Representative Yu Jiecai, July 8.</p>

<h3>Silk Factory Labor Dispute in Xinzha District to be Mediated Again Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Workers Still on Strike Yesterday</p>
<p>All workers from 14 silk factories including Fuchang in the Changan Road area of Xinzha District, declared a joint strike on the 2nd of this month to demand a pay raise, which has not yet been resolved for many days. The Bureau of Social Affairs previously mediated and advised both parties to try to reach an amicable settlement outside the government within three days. However, because the workers demanded a pay raise of ten cents per worker, while the employers only agreed to a pay raise of two cents per worker, there was still no result. Currently, the workers of the 14 silk factories are continuing their strike, but the factories are also unwilling to resume operations immediately due to a shortage of raw materials. It is understood that the Bureau of Social Affairs, in order to quickly resolve this dispute, has now scheduled to convene both parties again at 1:00 PM tomorrow (Monday) to continue mediation, in order to avoid prolonged disputes.</p>
<h3>Workers Request Continued Mediation in Sino-Foreign Labor Dispute</h3>
<p>Opinions of Both Parties Still Difficult to Reconcile</p>
<p>All workers of the Nanshi China Merchants Electric Company raised a dispute over the request to amend service regulations and improve treatment, which has been deadlocked for a long time. Although party and government agencies have repeatedly convened mediation, it has not been resolved because the opinions of both parties are opposed. The workers are worried that if this continues to be delayed, labor unrest will inevitably occur, so they specifically requested the Municipal Party Committee member Lu Jingshi to act as mediator. It is now learned that after Lu discussed the dispute with the company's manager Lu Bohong, the company refused to increase workers' salaries but agreed to subsidize those with a salary below 40 yuan with 3 yuan, those with a salary below 60 yuan with 2 yuan, and those above 60 yuan with 1 yuan. However, the workers believe that the company is not sincere in negotiating, expressed indignation, specifically held a meeting yesterday to discuss countermeasures, and requested Lu Jingshi to continue mediating in order to avoid labor unrest.</p>

<h3>Launch of Movement to Abolish Concession Film Censorship to be Held This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Extremely Enthusiastic Participation of Cultural Groups. A Declaration Will Be Issued to Make a Solemn Statement.</p>
<p>The Shanghai cultural community's movement to abolish the film and opera censorship rights of the concessions is scheduled to hold an inaugural meeting at 3:00 PM today (the 11th) at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce near Tianhou Palace Bridge. A declaration will be issued to solemnly state the illegality of the concession's censorship rights and to draw the attention of the Chinese people. The General Association of Electric Education will send personnel to Shanghai to guide and promote the movement. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation of Cultural Groups</p>
<p>The cultural community of this city, in view of the concession authorities' arbitrary destruction of our national film scripts and songs under the guise of censorship, especially the films and operas with national defense awareness and national salvation produced by various film companies, playwrights and composers recently, have been unreasonably censored and banned from performance. Even those that have been approved by the central government have also been banned from public performances in the concession. Therefore, the movement to abolish the film and opera censorship rights of the concessions was launched to safeguard sovereignty and save cultural life. The cultural groups that have officially participated in the movement include the Shanghai branch of the China Film Education Association, the Shanghai Film Production Industry Association, the Newspaper Association Drama Writers Association, the Song Writers Association, the China Literature and Art Association, the Shanghai Journalists Association, the PEN Club, the Theater Troupe Friendship Association, the Book Industry Association, the Shanghai Interview Journalists Friendship Association, the Poets Association Broadcasting Industry Association and other twenty-four units, which is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Inaugural Meeting to be Held Today</p>
<p>After the launch of the movement, the participating groups elected the Film Production Industry Association, the Theater Troupe Friendship Association, the China Literature and Art Association, the Drama Writers Association and the Song Writers Association to form a preparatory committee to actively carry out the preparations. Now the draft organization charter has been formulated by the preparatory committee, and everything is ready. The inaugural meeting will be held at 3:00 PM today (the 11th) in the auditorium of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce near Tianhou Palace Bridge. In addition to passing the charter and electing officers, a declaration will also be issued to express a solemn statement on the unreasonableness of the current film and opera censorship system in the concession, with the aim of promoting the sympathy of international public opinion and the attention of the Chinese people, and discussing practical methods for abolishing the censorship. The General Association of China Film Education Association has specially sent representative Lu Juewu to Shanghai to guide everything.</p>
<h3>Jin Su, Who Stabbed Yan Duhe, Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>The original judgment sentenced Jin to six months in prison and two years of guardianship.</p>
<p>Jin Su, a clerk of the Jiangsu High Court branch and a native of Suzhou, has in recent years experienced an inexplicable illness that he believed was caused by Yan Duhe, deputy editor-in-chief of the Xinwen Bao, who used a type of evil magic that humans cannot resist. Consequently, he has repeatedly harassed Yan. Despite explanations, he remained deluded. On April 25 of this year, at 1:00 PM, Jin prepared a file knife and waited at the entrance of the Xinwen Bao. When Yan arrived at the office, Jin stepped forward and stabbed Yan in the neck. Jin was immediately arrested and sent to the First Special District Court, which sentenced Jin to six months in prison and two years of guardianship. Jin appealed to the First Branch of the High Court, which has also concluded the hearing. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning was the day for sentencing. Mr. Gan Jingxian, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, was also present in court. Judge Shan Yuhua, accompanied by Judges Peng and Xiao, ascended to the Criminal Court No. 1 and announced the verdict: the appeal was rejected.</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Committee Requests Protest Against the PWD's Oppression</h3>
<p>Interfering with the Opening of Anti-Smuggling Slogans, Arbitrary Arrests of Youths Singing National Salvation Songs</p>
<p>Yu Yaoqiu, executive member of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association yesterday, requesting that a representative assembly of taxpayers be convened as soon as possible to protest against the PWD's illegal interference with the showing of anti-smuggling slogans in various cinemas and the arrest of youths singing national salvation songs. The letter stated: "To the esteemed Association, it has been found that on the 27th of last month, the Shanghai Anti-Smuggling Movement Committee, saddened by the rampant smuggling that encroaches on the entire Chinese market and causes great harm to legitimate commerce both domestically and internationally, held a propaganda rally to awaken the Chinese people to unite in stopping smuggling. The committee also sent letters to various cinemas asking them to show propaganda slogans to promote public awareness. However, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession sent personnel to prevent and interfere, which is outrageous. Furthermore, on the evening of the 9th of this month, some young students sang national salvation songs in the Bund Park, which is a common pastime on summer nights. However, the police arrested and arbitrarily beat them, abusing their power. All of these actions disrespect our national rights and dignity to the extreme. If this continues, what can we expect? I, Yaoqiu, have silently observed the past and considered the future, and I feel deeply concerned and cannot remain silent. I believe that your esteemed association is a special organization to protect the legal interests of the Chinese people in the concession. Therefore, I respectfully request that you speak out for justice to uphold national dignity and satisfy public expectations."</p>
<h3>Seven Suspects in Ningbo-Shandong Gang Fight Sent to Court Yesterday for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Caused by a Bicycle Race, Identity of Murderer to be Investigated</p>
<p>At the entrance of Heng Deli, Meizhou Road, Yangshupu, at 7:40 PM the day before yesterday, gangs from Ningbo and Shandong, over a minor matter, gathered hundreds of thugs each to engage in a large-scale brawl. As a result, Chinese plainclothes detective Zha Haikun, No. 1895, age 30, native of Suqian, was fatally stabbed, and Chinese detective No. 2944 was also injured. Xia Zhongqi and Zhang Gui, detectives from the Yangshupu police station, arrived upon hearing the alarm, and together with Chinese detectives Nos. 285 and 2962, apprehended the following suspects: Chen Zhilin, Zhou Xiaoqing, Qiu Jiuxing, Xu Sibiao, Qi Zhengyou from Ningbo; Shen Zhaojin from Jiangbei; Du Changtai from Xuzhou; Fang Quegui, Li Wanfu, Zhu Siyuan, and Qin Libang from Shandong, totaling eleven people. Along with the suspects, a murder weapon, a long knife, and a long gun were brought to the police station. Chinese detective No. 2944 and Chen Zhilin, Shen Zhaojin, Zhou Xiaoqing, and Du Changtai all sustained serious injuries and were sent to the hospital for treatment. The deceased, Zha Haikun, was taken to the forensic examination facility on Feilun Road to await examination. Qiu Jiuxing, Qin Libang, and seven others were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the cause of the incident was that the defendant Qin Libang (age 17) and Qiu Amao (age 19) from Ningbo were racing bicycles on the road on the 7th of this month. Qin won due to his superior skill, causing Yin to become enraged and start an argument. Yin beat Qin and dispersed. At that time, an old Ningbo man saw two people beating one and said that it was not honorable, and Du Changtai (the fifth defendant) from the Shandong gang also intervened, causing another argument. Both sides then gathered hundreds of people each for a brawl. The deceased, plainclothes detective, Zha Haikun, lived at No. 19 Heng Deli. Hearing the noise, he went outside to call the police at the police亭, was regarded as an accomplice, and was fatally stabbed. The identity of the murderer has not yet been determined and requested an extension. Judge Xiao Xiefen questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for a further hearing in seven days. The court sent Prosecutor Tang to the forensic examination facility to examine Zha Haikun's body. It was determined that the deceased, Zha Haikun, male, died from a stab wound inflicted by a sharp weapon. The body was handed over to his wife, Zha Lu, for burial after she provided a written guarantee.</p>

<h3>Youths Singing National Salvation Songs Arrested in Bund Park</h3>
<p>Deemed to be Disturbing Order in the Park, Singing Resumes After Incident</p>
<p>At approximately 10:00 PM the night before last, a music program was held in the Bund Park, and the crowds were very crowded. Over a dozen youths sang national salvation songs on the lawn near the Suzhou Creek Bridge. At the same time, a few tourists stood and watched, occasionally clapping in agreement. This was immediately interfered with by the park manager, who reported it to the police by telephone. Before long, a large number of Chinese and foreign police officers arrived in cars and motorcycles and began to encircle and arrest them. The singers fled, and the police chased after them, whistling. For a time, the order was disrupted, but due to the large number of tourists in the park, only three youths were arrested. One of them was slapped several times on the spot and then taken away in a police car. Around 11:00 PM, the tourists gradually dispersed, and the song "Forward, forward, fight back to our hometown" resumed in the Huangpu River. Several youths sang loudly on small boats near the park, but no further incidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Russian Policeman and Russian Émigré Commit Suicide Separately</h3>
<p>Families Not in Shanghai</p>
<p>LachbeVisde, a 26-year-old Russian policeman No. 16 of the French police, committed suicide by shooting himself at 0:20 AM yesterday on the stairway of the two-story building at No. 11 Zhubao San Road. One bullet missed, and the other two hit the vital part of his left chest. He fell to the ground and died immediately. The French police were notified and immediately sent the body to the Western forensic examination facility attached to the PWD Hospital on Tarlac Road (commonly known as the "Small Hospital"). Also, Vassibcvyky, a Russian man about 40 years old, hanged himself on the iron fence of the window of the Western restaurant at No. 61 Henry Road in the French Concession the night before last due to financial difficulties. At 5:00 AM yesterday morning, a Russian in the restaurant discovered it and reported it to the French police. After investigation by Western detectives, the body was sent to the forensic examination facility attached to the PWD Hospital on Tarlac Road. The above two bodies were reported to the Second Special District Court Procuratorate yesterday morning, and the chief prosecutor was commissioned to visit the facility at around 10:00 AM with the coroner. It was confirmed that the deaths were suicide by gunshot wound and hanging, respectively. Because the families of both deceased were not in Shanghai, the official ordered the Western charity of the PWD to arrange for burial. The reason for the Russian policeman's suicide is unknown and is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Passenger Jumps Overboard from New Ning Shao Steamer</h3>
<p>Approximately Thirty Years Old, Seemingly a Worker, Search Unsuccessful, No Suicide Note</p>
<p>The New Ning Shao steamer of the Ning Shao Company, which sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo at 5:00 PM on the 7th, had a passenger jump overboard after the ship left Wusong Port. The reporter of the Datong News Agency has gathered the following information:</p>
<p>Passenger Description</p>
<p>The New Ning Shao steamer sailed from Shanghai to Ningbo at 5:00 PM on the 7th. In the fourth-class cabin of the ship, there was a passenger, approximately thirty years old, with a long face and tall stature, Western-style hair, wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants, and yellow running shoes. He did not carry luggage, and did not show any signs of worry or sorrow.</p>
<p>Jumping into the Sea at Wusong</p>
<p>Shortly after, during the dinner time on the ship, the passenger only ordered a bottle of soda and did not eat a meal. At 6:45, just after the ship left Wusong Port, the passenger suddenly climbed over the railing and jumped into the sea. At that time, the sky was not yet dark, so many people saw it. However, after stopping the ship and searching, nothing was found. Moreover, as he had no suicide note or belongings, the cause of death could not be speculated.</p>
<h3>Two Suspects Arrested for Using Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>Conspiring to Mix Counterfeit Money with Cigarette Paper Bottoms, Ordered Remanded in Custody for Further Hearing</p>
<p>Huang Yusheng and Du Qingshan from Hubei recently conspired to use two counterfeit Central Bank legal tender notes of one yuan each at Fan Zhaohua's small cigarette paper shop at No. 47 Yalu Road. The case was exposed, and Xu Yongyuan, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road police station, arrested them one after another. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan requested an extension. Judge Xiao questioned the two defendants, and their statements were evasive. They were ordered to be remanded in custody for a further hearing.</p>
<h3>Steamer Steward Accused of Obscenity Reaches Settlement</h3>
<p>Under the Pretense of Bringing Hometown Goods, Raped Ms. Wang Chen's Sister-in-Law</p>
<p>Cao Chaoqun, a 31-year-old steward on the Dahua steamer, from Nantong. The ship regularly travels between Shanghai and Haimen, Taizhou, Zhejiang. In the spring of this year, Ms. Wang Chen, from Haimen, Zhejiang, came to Shanghai on the ship and chatted on the ship, thus getting acquainted with Cao Chaoqun, saying that the ship often sails to Haimen, and if you want to bring hometown goods, I can help you handle it. After inquiring about Ms. Wang Chen's residence in Shanghai, she went to her home to visit her, his intentions not for the goods. Ms. Wang Chen then handed over one yuan, asking him to bring charcoal. The first time the ship arrived in Shanghai, Ms. Wang Chen and her fifteen-year-old sister-in-law, Wang Xiaoxia, went to the port together to pick up the charcoal. Cao had not yet handled it. The second time the ship arrived, Ms. Wang Chen suddenly fell ill. At about 4:00 PM on the tenth of last month, she ordered Wang Xiaoxia to collect it alone. Cao, being a lascivious person, saw the young sister's delicate and charming appearance, and lust arose. He lured Xiaoxia to Room 20 and forcibly raped her. It was not until about 10:00 PM that afternoon that he released Xiaoxia. Xiaoxia, knowing shame, was unhappy because of the matter of reputation, crying every day, which caused her to be mentally exhausted. Her sister-in-law saw that the situation was very different and asked her, but she refused to tell the truth. On the 14th, Wang Xiaoxia felt pain and discomfort in her lower body, and had to tell Wang Chen about the disease. She was sent to the Xiaodongmen Hospital for treatment. On one side, Ms. Wang told the court about Cao Chaoqun, filed a public prosecution for the crime of obscenity. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing opened the court. The defendant's lawyers Yan Hujun and Fang Gang defended him. The question officer said that the plaintiff now filed a statement saying that the case has been settled out of court, compensated for damages, and withdrew the lawsuit. Since the case is based on accusation, it is allowed to be withdrawn and not pursued, and then ordered to adjourn the court.</p>
<h3>Hatong's Adopted Son Spends Extravagantly, 300 Yuan for One Meal</h3>
<p>Hatong's Wife Does Not Acknowledge Debt and Publishes Notice Denying Any Relationship</p>
<p>George Hatong, the 18-year-old adopted son of the late millionaire Hatong, is a Eurasian mix who is usually very extravagant. On Thursday night, he went to a restaurant on Jiaozhou Road with three White Russian girls and had a feast. The waiter then presented the bill, demanding payment for the food and drink, totaling 300 yuan. He then signed a check to pay it. The restaurant owner called Hatong's wife to inquire, but she did not acknowledge it. The restaurant owner then sent the four to the Jiaozhou Road police station. The police station did not detain them. The four have not returned home since leaving the police station. The names of the three girls have not been ascertained. It is not known whether they are still with the girls, lingering and forgetting to return. Hatong's wife has already published advertisements in various newspapers yesterday, denying that the young man has any relationship with the Hatong family, so all his debts should be borne by himself and have nothing to do with Hatong's wife.</p>
<h3>Father and Son Robbing in Cooperation by Flashing Money</h3>
<p>Under the Pretense of Police Officer Raiding Smuggled Goods, Fortunately Discovered and Arrested by Chinese Police</p>
<p>Zhu Shuoshou from Qingtian, Zhejiang, 25 years old, has been engaged in commerce in Qingtian. Recently, he planned to go to France to do business. He came to Shanghai a few days ago and stayed at the Yong'an Hotel on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession. He entrusted 450 yuan in cash to the French Post Ship Company on Aiduya Road Huangpu Bund to apply for a passport and purchase a ship ticket for his departure to France, but because the passport could not be obtained, Zhu went to the French Post Ship Company at 7:00 AM on the 9th to collect the 450 yuan he had paid. Unexpectedly, the money was exposed, and the bandits Wang Zhongcheng (21 years old) and Wang Zhong (41 years old) from Wenzhou, father and son, who lived at No. 36 Lujia宅, Xiaodongmen, and two accomplices saw it, followed him to Tianzhutang Street, and Wang Zhongcheng posed as a police officer and threatened Zhu, saying that the paper bag he was carrying contained smuggled goods or red pills of opium, and wanted to forcibly rob him. Detective Ji Chengxi and Chinese policeman No. 192 saw them and arrested Wang and his son. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court, and Judge Liao Jian interrogated them in Criminal Court No. 1. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the case and requested an extension of the investigation. The detective reported the investigation process, saying that there was a witness, the chauffeur of the French Consulate, who saw it but was not present today and could be summoned for questioning next time. The complainant Zhu Canyu said that I left the French Post Ship Company and went to Tianzhutang Street. Wang Zhongcheng asked me what was in my bag. I answered that it was money. He wanted to see it. Wang Zhong stopped me, and two people in white silk shirts and pants argued with me. The police arrested the defendants. Wang Zhongcheng confessed that he knew the plaintiff. He often made fake passports to cheat our fellow villagers into going abroad and becoming displaced, unable to return to their hometowns, and harming people's bankruptcies and deaths. Yesterday I met him and reported it to the police, and there was no intention to rob him, and asked the lawyer to defend him. Wang Zhong confessed that he was not present at the time. He learned that his son was arrested and went to the police station to inquire. The plaintiff accused me of being there, which is a false accusation. In court, the judge reviewed the confession, ordered a rehearing at 9:00 AM on the 17th, ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, and refused the request for bail. The stolen money was temporarily handed over to the detectives for safekeeping, and the complainant was required to attend the hearing next time.</p>

<h3>Husband Dies of Illness, Two Women Contend for Estate, Leading to Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Fan Li Sues Fan Zhao and Xing Zhigang for Embezzlement</p>
<p>Fan Li, a rural woman from the Fengjiazhai area of Shanghai County, along with Fan Qiaosheng, her husband's adopted son, filed a private prosecution in the local court against Fan Zhao, another woman of her deceased husband, and Xing Zhigang, the district chief of the Fifth District, for embezzlement. Yesterday, Judge Lu Hongze of the Shanghai District Court held a hearing. The plaintiff, Fan Li, did not appear. Fan Qiaosheng, the adopted son, testified that he was 37 years old, a native of Shanghai, and worked in the dry goods business. He was suing Xing Zhigang and Fan Zhao over family matters. His deceased adoptive father, Fan Shuntang, passed away on February 15th of last year. After his adoptive father's death, the defendant, Fan Zhao, and the family disputed the land deeds. As a result, the land deeds were entrusted to the township office for safekeeping. There were over 40 mu (a Chinese unit of measurement for land) in total, as well as three Shanghai County land deeds, three Nanhui County land deeds, and one split deed, roughly equivalent to another 20 mu. The exact amount was difficult to ascertain for the time being. Fan Zhao refused to hand them over, and Fan Zhao has three children. All the rent collected has been taken by Fan Zhao, which can be attested to by family elders. This year, Fan Zhao entrusted District Chief Xing to report to the public security bureau, claiming that over ten mu of land deeds held by the township office were lost and replaced. All the evidence was fabricated by Xing Zhigang alone. They jointly embezzled the property, and therefore, he requested investigation and prosecution. Fan Zhao testified that she was 33 years old, a native of Shanghai. Fan Shuntang was her husband, and she was his second wife, not a concubine. The plaintiff, Fan Li, was merely her husband's paramour. As for the family meeting, she and her children were not present and did not sign anything. The land deeds were all taken by them. She had none. Because they refused to return them after the robbery, she made a public statement in the newspaper that they were lost. Fan Qiaosheng is a nephew, not an adopted son. Her husband left a total of over 40 mu of land, not over 60 mu. When the robbery occurred, there were also contracts, jewelry, passbooks, and other items. Xing Zhigang, 48 years old, a native of Shanghai and the district chief of the Fifth District of Chenxing Town in Pudong, testified that Fan Zhao entrusted him to publish a statement in the newspaper declaring the land deeds lost. He asked the township head of Duzhi Township, Xi Musheng, to sign a guarantee, but he refused, so the matter was halted. In fact, on the 13th day of the second lunar month of the 25th year of the Republic [1936], Fan Shuntang became seriously ill. He called Fan Qiaosheng, who did not come. On the 15th, Shuntang passed away and was prepared for burial. Because Fan Qiaosheng wanted to grab the deceased's head, Fan Zhao refused. They went to his office in the district public office to mediate. Afterwards, Fan Qiaosheng tricked Fan Zhao into going to the public office. Fan Qiaosheng and others went to Fan Zhao's house, broke the lock, and went inside to rob land deeds, passbooks, etc. Lawyer Pan Zhensheng was retained to defend him. The court ordered that the hearing be adjourned for another day.</p>
<h3>Xu Xiuying Sues Yang Shouqing for Abandonment</h3>
<p>Xu Xiuying, a 28-year-old woman from Chuansha, met Yang Shouqing, also known as Yang Xiuqing, a wealthy man from No. 6, Liuzaowan, Yongdong (49 years old this year), four years ago. Enticed by Yang's sweet words and promise of marriage, Xu Xiuying did not let Yang's age diminish her love. After cohabitating, she gave birth to a daughter in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], who died on September 29th of last year. However, on March 4th of last year, she gave birth to another son, named Xuanxin. Recently, their love fractured. Yang not only neglects their livelihood but has disappeared completely. Xu Xiuying and her son reside at No. 50, Ruilefang, Lanwei Ai Road. Helpless as they are due to their dire financial straits, Yang Xuanxin, as the biological son, with Xu Xiuying as the legal guardian, sued Yang Shouqing for abandonment in the local court. Yesterday, a summons was issued, but the defendant refused to accept it. The court ordered the plaintiff to serve the summons.</p>
<h3>Special Public Buses to Be Operated for Various Exhibitions in the City Center</h3>
<p>Various exhibitions in the city center are scheduled to close on the 18th of this month. For the convenience of visitors from all walks of life, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Public Bus Company will not only increase the number of special buses departing from the Baoshan Road intersection but also, given the different locations of the various exhibitions, dispatch special buses from the Air Defense Exhibition (via the Sports Field to the Machinery Exhibition), the Handicraft Exhibition, the Safety Exhibition, the Municipal Exhibition, the Literature Exhibition, and the Hygiene Exhibition (Hygiene Experiment Institute). The fare will be four national currency units per person, regardless of distance.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Shatoff, Suspected of Being a Communist, Voluntarily Leaves Shanghai to Return to Russia</h3>
<p>Promises to Depart as Soon as Recovered from Illness; City Police Bureau Advisor Does Not Object</p>
<p>Mrs. Shatoff, a 34-year-old Russian woman, was arrested by the City Police Bureau, together with the Public Concession Police, on the afternoon of the 29th of last month on North Suzhou Road due to suspicion of being a Communist. Subsequently, many anti-government books were seized at the International Bookstore Company at No. 841 Jing'an Temple Road. She was sent to the High Court Second Branch for interrogation and ordered to pay a 300-yuan bail and await further questioning outside of jail. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Yu Huating, accompanied by Judges Peng and Xiao, ascended the bench for the hearing. The Shanghai City Police Bureau was represented by legal advisor Lawyer Zhan Jifeng. Mrs. Shatoff did not appear and delegated American lawyer Olmen to appear in court. He stated that the day Mrs. Shatoff was arrested was also the day her husband passed away. As a result, she was deeply traumatized and suddenly developed a lung disease. According to the doctor, she needs six weeks to recover. However, Mrs. Shatoff has expressed that she is willing to leave Shanghai and return to her country as soon as she recovers from her illness and can provide written proof. The court immediately asked Zhan Jifeng, the advisor to the City Police Bureau, for his opinion on the defendant lawyer's request. Advisor Zhan stated that if the defendant could provide a pledge to leave China and return to Russia as soon as she recovered from her illness, then the bureau would not object to the defendant's request. The Public Concession lawyer Gan Jingxian also had no objections to this proposal. Judge Yu then ordered Mrs. Shatoff to submit a written statement of her recovery and return to her country within three days, after which she would be allowed to reclaim her bail. The seized books will be sent to the City Party Headquarters for review and further handling.</p>

<h3>Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach Hosted Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Over 100 Reporters from Chinese and Western Newspapers Attended; Bathing Beach Has Perfect Facilities and Extremely Convenient Transportation</p>
<p>The Gaoqiao Seaside Bathing Beach, sponsored by the Shanghai Industrial and Trust Company, hosted the press for a tour and visit at 1:50 pm yesterday. Over two hundred reporters from Chinese and foreign newspapers attended. The company dispatched the No. 5 and No. 6 city ferries to transport them, and Manager Bo Ying personally hosted them on the ferries. They returned to the City Ferry Terminal on the Bund of Beijing Road at 6:30 pm. The various new facilities of the seaside bathing beach are listed as follows:</p>

This year, it has also added various melons and fruits, including watermelons and golden melons, which are all local Gaoqiao products, exceptionally fresh, and completely different from those sold in ordinary markets, ㊂ Candies and shortbread. Gaoqiao's famous local products, such as crispy shortbread, and various candies produced by Guanshengyuan, are all sold in the area. ㊃ Hygienic flaky biscuits. Flaky biscuits are the best popular food in our country. The ones sold at the bathing beach are especially unique.

In addition to the original hundred-odd tents, the bathing beach has added six canvas tents this year, which are taller and larger than the original tents, and have sunshades in front that can accommodate seven or eight people, like a pavilion, which is especially beautiful.</p>
<p>Shower Facilities</p>
<p>In addition to the men's and women's shower rooms with hot and cold water faucets for visitors to shower, the bathing beach also has an outdoor shower area, which is the most novel and unique. Adding rented cars. This year, in addition to fully reorganizing and repainting all the existing public buses, four additional large and small buses have been rented to facilitate tourists.

<p>Since the bathing beach was changed to be managed by the city, the number of tourists has increased greatly due to the perfect facilities, but it is still mostly on weekends and holidays. In order to fully promote the outings and sea bathing of citizens living in the city, the City Ferry Management Office has specially issued a seaside sightseeing ticket, the most economical round-trip fare, only four jiao, breaking the world record for the lowest consumption of sea bathing in various countries.</p>
<h3>Two of the Three Defendants Have the Same Name and Surname</h3>
<p>The Results of the Trial Showed That They Were Not the Actual Perpetrators</p>
<p>During the Shanghai war in the 21st year of the Republic [1932], Ji Zhongtang, a detective who had been dismissed, was shot and killed in the Xiangyan Bridge area of Hongkou due to a dispute over gambling rights. At the time, the widow of the deceased, Ji Wu, accused the murderers of being Wang Shubao, Zheng Xiaoheizi, and Wang Sanshizi. Ji's apprentice, Zhang Xiaowanzi, testified. The case was delayed until last year, when the local court arrested Wang Shubao, the owner of the Xiangwu Stage, and sentenced him to 13 years in prison. Upon appeal, Zhang Xiaowanzi testified that the murderer was another Wang Shubao with a pockmarked face. As a result, the original sentence was revoked and he was declared innocent. Recently, Wang Sanshizi was arrested again. After investigation by the local court, and upon learning of this, Ji filed a complaint seeking prosecution. The prosecutor then filed a public prosecution. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zongxing held a hearing. Wang Sanshizi claimed that he was named Sanshizi because his father was 30 years old when he was born. He did not kill Ji Zhongtang. The Wang Sanshizi accused was another person with the same name and surname. When the official questioned Zhang Xiaowanzi, he also stated, as in the previous case, that there was another Wang Sanshizi, and not the Wang Sanshizi in the case. The official considered that in one case, there were actually two defendants with the same name, which was a peculiar fact. The case should be handled pending a ruling.</p>
<h3>Major Bandit Gang Murder Case Reopened for Debate Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sentencing Set for the Morning of the 16th</p>
<p>Zhang Ganqing, a major bandit from Hefei, Anhui, colluded with accomplices on the afternoon of December 1st of last year to rob a woman's handbag on Route Lafayette in the French Concession. He opened fire and resisted arrest, killing a Russian, Li Yaming George (transliteration), before fleeing. On March 17th of this year, he again robbed the Dacheng Money Exchange in Zhenjiang, obtaining mostly auxiliary currency coupons, and fled to Shanghai with the loot. He was arrested by the French Concession Police. His accomplices, Wang Fuan and Zhang Guangcai, were also apprehended. It was also discovered that an accomplice, Yu Deshi, had been arrested in Hefei. Detectives were sent to transfer him to Shanghai. Two box cannons and dozens of bullets found in Zhang Guangcai's home were also brought to the Special Second Court for interrogation and detention. The Shanghai City Police Bureau and the Zhenjiang Police Department successively sent detectives to the Special Second Court to request the transfer of the bandits for interrogation. This has been reported in previous newspapers. This case was originally concluded by Liao Jun, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, after repeatedly holding court hearings and examining witnesses. A date was set for sentencing. However, because there were still unclear aspects of the case, the conclusion of the debate was revoked. At 11:00 am yesterday, Presiding Judge Liao attended the Criminal Court No. 1 and ordered the defendants to be brought to court for a reopening of the debate and hearing. The French Concession Police Department was represented by Lawyer Fei Xizhen, who prosecuted Zhang Ganqing for attempted robbery and murder, Wang Fuan for robbery and murder, Zhang Guangcai for illegal possession of firearms, and Yu Debu for robbery, citing relevant provisions of the criminal law. The court appointed lawyers Jin Xiongbo and Zhu Dianqing to defend the defendants. After the court questioned the defendants in detail, it ordered the debate to begin. First, Prosecutor Wang Ren presented his opinions, followed by mutual debate between the police department and the defendants' defense lawyers. The court announced the conclusion of the debate and set the sentencing for 9:00 am on the 16th. The defendants were returned to the detention center. After the verdict in this case, because the defendants also committed robbery cases in the Chinese-controlled area of the city, the Shanghai City Police Bureau will first transfer them for interrogation. After the interrogation is concluded, the Zhenjiang Police Department will transfer the defendants back to Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Society Scheduled to Draw Lots on the 15th</h3>
<p>Special Prize Money Exceeds 25,000 Yuan</p>

It is heard that the number of first, second, third, and fourth prizes has been increased to 25 each. There are also many consolation prizes and unclaimed prizes, making it very easy to win. Therefore, subscribers are very enthusiastic about joining the society.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Association Sends Letter to He Dekui to Plead for Vendors</h3>
<p>Stall Vendors on Yuanfang Road Cannot Afford the Heavy Donation; Please Show Consideration and Maintain the Original Status</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Ningbo and Fenghua Native Associations in Shanghai sent a letter to He Dekui, the Deputy General Manager of the Public Works Department, yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you because we received a letter from more than 80 people from the Fenghua Native Association, including Ru Qing, stating that they make a living by setting up stalls selling vegetables, fish, and meat along Yuanfang Road and Old Street in Shanghai. They have been paying a donation of two yuan per stall per month for many years. Recently, the Public Works Department decided to change the donation method starting on July 1st of this year, with each stall paying nine national currency units per quarter, paid in one lump sum, which is an increase of one yuan per month compared to the previous donation. These fellow villagers are all small-scale businesses, with each stall having a capital of six or seven yuan at most, and only two or three yuan at the least. They rely on meager profits to support their entire families. The increased donation is already an unbearable burden, and paying in one lump sum is even more difficult. They entrusted us to find a way to help them. On the 26th of last month, our Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai forwarded the request to the Public Works Department, hoping that the Public Works Department would consider the actual difficulties of these vendors and allow them to maintain the original status quo. We have not received a reply yet. Suddenly, the police in charge sent personnel to collect donations from each vendor, collecting two yuan per month according to the original donation. The vendors were overjoyed, thinking that the Public Works Department had approved the request and maintained the original status quo. Unexpectedly, the next day, the donation office sent personnel to collect a donation fee of nine yuan per stall per quarter from the vendors, and pointed out that the previously issued permits were illegal, causing panic among the crowd. Subsequently, they recovered the two-yuan permits from each stall and ordered them to collect the nine-yuan-per-quarter permits. The vendors felt that the matter was ambiguous. If they paid according to the new regulations, they would be unable to bear the heavy burden. However, the donation officers used force to collect the donations as coercion. The vendors recently came to the association again to request relief. Our association believes that the matter pertains to the legal rights and interests of our fellow villagers. In addition to instructing the vendors to wait patiently for a solution, we specially dispatched Chen Zhonggao and Dong Xinqin to accompany the representatives publicly elected by the vendors to present their difficulties. We sincerely hope that you will grant us an audience. We are writing to you for this purpose, hoping you will investigate and handle the matter accordingly."</p>
