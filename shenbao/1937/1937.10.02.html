<h3>市中心敵退集江邊劉行血戰敵軍傷亡奇重</h3>
<p>顧家宅斃敵聯隊長士兵傷亡六百　羅店方面敵犯施相公廟被　我擊退我空軍昨不斷夜襲敵陣地受重創　閘北我軍陣地有進展</p>
<p>敵自上月二十九日晨下第四次總攻擊令後、卽以生力部隊藉飛機大炮坦克車之掩護、向我全線陣地衝襲、我軍以逸待勞、沉着殺敵、頑敵傷亡遍野、進退維谷、始終未能越雷池一步、於是改以排砲不絕向我全綫轟擊、圖先燬滅我陣地工事、然後得以從容進佔、在過去二十四小時內、敵砲至少在數千發以上、然我前綫工事損害甚微、而全綫陣地更絕無變動、足證敵已黔驢技窮矣、本報今晨三時所獲前方報告如下、㊀劉行附近戰事最爲劇烈、敵我本在荻涇河隔岸對峙、前昨敵數度偷渡、均被擊退、昨晨敵主力部隊、由大批坦克車掩護、迂迴襲我劉行側面、我軍奮勇迎戰、敵亦頑抗、刻尚在混戰中、㊁顧家宅方面、敵爲策應劉行附近之軍事、亦以主力進犯、二十名敵軍且一度衝入我陣地、經我包圍夾擊、不旋踵卽被我全數掃滅、是役敵傷亡奇重、我軍大勝、昨晚敵繼續進犯、刻血戰未停、㊂羅店方面、敵圖突破我施相公廟一帶防綫、經我數度截擊、已狼狽退却、㊃閘北方面、我陣綫續有推進、福生路殘敵已全部肅淸、㊄市中心區西面區域之敵軍確已後撤、似抽調該方面隊伍參加羅店劉行綫戰事、我軍正在嚴密搜索殘敵、逐漸向前推進中、</p>
<h3>敵軍於砲火掩護下兩犯顧家宅受創</h3>
<p>聯隊長鈴木被擊斃　士兵傷亡六百餘衆</p>
<p>敵軍開始其第四次總攻後、四日以來、全綫均展開猛烈血戰、江灣閘北、雖有不絕之爭門、但雙方主力、仍集中於羅店劉行之綫、故戰事亦以該兩綫最爲激烈、羅店西北之施相公廟、二日以來、敵軍集中砲火於該處我軍陣地、前晚、敵以一聯隊之衆、一再向我陣地猛衝、我軍英勇迎戰、敵傷亡無算、始終不得逞、劉行正面之敵、昨前二日、向我顧家宅陣地、一再進犯、敵軍連續不息以大砲及飛機轟炸後、昨晨大隊敵軍、衝入我警戒綫內、我軍奮起接戰、迎頭痛擊、進犯之敵、殲減無算、餘敵仍在據險頑抗、昨晨至晚、激戰不息、敵砲雖始終未曾停止、但我軍陣地、毫未損害、今晨接前方消息、進犯顧家宅之敌、已有退潰模樣、</p>
<p>兩犯顧家宅　傷亡六百餘</p>
<p>中央社云、隨军記者一日下午六時報告、敵軍昨夜（三十日）十一時、又向劉行東南之顧家宅進犯、先以大砲轟擊、我軍静伏、故示無備、敵遂以步兵百餘人衢鋒、破綫絲網、逼近陣前、我軍此時突以機關槍掃射、並向兩面躍出、包抄夾攻、敵軍不及逃竄、被我完全殲滅、敵軍遭此痛擊、遂於一日晨二時起、以大砲向我陣地不斷轟擊、迄十時許、尚未停止、惟我陣地始終屹然未動、工事毫未損毀、</p>
<p>又據我軍事機關接得報告、敵軍昨晨以大砲及飛機、向我顧家宅陣地不斷轟炸、至九時許、又以步兵千餘人、向我陣地進犯、來勢極爲兇猛、我軍沉着應戰、先以機關槍向敵掃射、予以痛擊後、步兵躍出與敵肉搏、激戰至午、敵聯隊長鈴木八郎被我擊斃、且以傷亡過重、狼狽潰退、是役敵軍死傷逹五百餘人、並被我擊斃官佐五員、截獲步槍機關槍甚多、</p>
<p>敵軍以全力犯羅店劉行</p>
<p>羅店劉行間、以滬太公路相聯絡以策應左右兩冀、故劉行在軍事上頗關重要、該區溝渠密備、共主流爲荻涇、我爲避免重大損失、故均憑河之西岸固守、而公路大部在我警戒綫之西、惟在劉行鎮起、路綫向東突出、約長一公里至殷家閣附近、兩相交叉、故該叚形勢、頗爲險惡、我軍深壕堅壘、防守尤爲嚴密、</p>
<p>凡三次偷渡　敵均吿失敗</p>
<p>前夜敵以戰車二十餘輛、步兵二千餘、向我劉行東北周家巷西王宅一營警戒綫進犯、被我軍奮勇截擊、終歸失敗、同時有敵千餘則向北移動、企圖在殷家閣附近渡河、當被我軍迎擊、負創而退、羅店劉行之間郭巷橋附近、亦有敵軍企圖渡河、被我截殺、傷亡奇重、亦終失敗、</p>
<h3>市中心敵軍突撤退</h3>
<p>薀藻浜以北之敵軍亦撤　大部退至虬江碼頭集中</p>
<p>市中心區之敵、日前沿淞滬路綫構造工事、共爲忙碌、但二十九日起、其部隊突然向後移動、我軍初以爲敵方係調集兵力、以備向我進攻、前日敵軍以猛烈之砲火、向我陣地轟擊、我軍傳令嚴密戒備、等待廝殺、詎意前夜除有哨兵接觸外、前綫殊屬寗靜、我軍深爲詫異、乃於昨晨爲先發制人計、乘天時微明、驟行進攻、敵前哨慌亂異常、向市中心區奔竄而去、轉瞬間我陣地前方已無敵踪、我軍卽向前推進、並派兵前往偵察、則大地沉叔、已杳無人影、倭寇詭計多端、不知又將作何企圖、又據中央社隨軍記者、報告市中心區及薀藻浜北之敵軍二千餘人、分兩路向楊樹浦及吳淞撤退、企圖不明、我軍正搜索前進中、</p>
<p>據午夜所得報告盤踞於江灣泗涇球塲及市中心區其美路黃興路各處之敵於昨午起大部撤退向虬江碼頭集中、</p>
<h3>江灣閘北敵軍撤退</h3>
<p>我軍一部已進佔該處</p>
<p>中央社蘇州一日電、據前方確息江灣東南方金家巷·狄家浜·尤沙港·吳家宅·附近之敵、巳於三十日午後五時、完全撒退、又閘北談家鎮（在水電路轉灣角上）附近、及奚塘灣張家巷之敵、亦同時撤退、刻我軍一部已進佔該處、</p>
<h3>敵圖衝閘北被擊退</h3>
<p>中央社云、敵在閘北方面屢次侵擾、均歸敗退、昨晨、敵之大砲不斷向我陣地轟擊、並於一時起、敵軍又大肆活動、在北四川路老靶子路口、虬江路口、寶興路口、皆有敵軍坦克車整隊活動、至四時半左右、敵軍二中隊、在坦克車掩護之下、由虬江路口衝入、我軍紛紛躍登沿街樓房、居高臨下、以輕關槍及手溜彈猛向敵軍及其坦克車投擊掃射、敵軍倉皇不敢續進、我軍乘機進迫、至七時許、敵終不支而退、是役敵死傷五十餘人、尚有坦克車一輛、被我擊毀、已不堪再用、</p>
<p>中央社云、閘北方面、敵昨竟日蠢動、晨間敵由虬江路口用坦克車數輛向我陣地衝來、當被擊退、下午一時左右、捲土重來、敵坦克車數輛掩護敵軍一中隊、分向寶興路虬江路一帶我陣地進犯、我軍以機關槍掃射、寶興路之敵接戰僅一刻鐘、卽知難而退、虬江路之敵、猶圖頑抗、我軍迎擊肉搏、斃敵十餘人、至三時左右、該處敵軍、亦卽以戰車殿後掩旗息鼓而退、</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晚七時、敵坦克車多輛、在北四川路南端頗形活動、似另有企圖富堪注意、我已嚴密戒備、</p>
<h3>福生路敵軍被肅淸</h3>
<p>寶山路南端北車站之處、我早有嚴密佈置、該處雖爲戰事之導發地、但我軍固守原陣、迄無變更、共他多窄道小巷、敵常偸襲進犯、輒爲我機關槍小鋼砲等擊退、肉搏衝鋒、不下百次、前晚我軍挑選精強部隊、實行夜襲、盤踞於靶子路北首我民房內之敵軍、見我進攻、甚爲驚慌、敵在福生路及赫司克爾路口、均置有機關槍駐守戒備、我軍機警異常、以一部在暗處摸索前進、既近火綫、乃突破民屋、翻越而過、直進至敵軍機關槍陣地之後、以手溜彈向敵襲擊、餘部亦以機關槍衝擊、斃敵甚多、餘衆棄械而逃、刻福生路百星大戲院等處、已無敵踪、</p>
<h3>敵在閘北浪費彈藥</h3>
<p>昨日閘北方面、敵軍之大砲飛機仍繼續轟炸、茂海路西首不遠之處、竟爲敵機所注目、在該處投彈不下二十枚、敵自開始總攻以來其空襲之目標、殊爲混亂、所有高樓大厦、均成其標的、每次輒以炸彈二枚或四枚同時投擲、但因我高射跑火猛烈、巳不敢低飛、每在高空隨意擲下、毫無軍事作用、其耗費軍火可見一斑、據我駐軍發表、兩日敵投彈不下百枚、我軍僅輕傷者廿一人而已、</p>
<h3>敵艦大部開往瀏河</h3>
<p>停泊浦內各敵艦、於昨晚起、忽有一部陸續自浦內駛出、開往瀏河一帶江面停泊、其中尤以驅逐艦爲最多、察其形勢、似對我該處又有何項企圖者、據記者本日上午調査所得、現泊浦內敵艦共爲十九艘、其中驅逐艦僅餘二艘、一泊八號浮筒、一泊陸家嘴浦面一號浮筒、此外除運輸艦七艘、出雲旗艦一艘外、所剩九艘、皆爲砲艦</p>
<h3>敵援軍四萬全到滬</h3>
<p>敵第四次增援軍一師團及一旅團、今約四萬餘人、連日來已陸續開抵上海者、總數已達三萬五千人左右、且已於前日（二十八日）起開始作第四次總攻、昨晨七時至八時、又續有敵商輪改建之第五二號運輪艦生島丸、第一三六號運輸艦海平丸、第四六號運輸艦明石丸、第二六六號運輸艦善洋丸、第二六二號運輸艦泰安丸、第一七零號運輸艦總洋丸等共六艘、相繼駛滬、分別停靠大阪黃浦匯山三碼頭、當又有敵第四次增援軍之最後一批約六千餘人登陸云、</p>
<h3>楊樹浦之敵軍調査</h3>
<p>本報特訊、軍息、玆據探報、㊀楊樹浦韜朋路底華界姚家橋之北、小皇廟之南、所有民房及空地、敵軍在該處設立篷房甚多、並駐有敵軍約六千餘人、均係由前方調回休息者、都疲乏不堪、㊁虬江碼頭有樓房五所、中間一所、儲有多量軍火、北面一間、駐有戰馬兩百餘匹、南面一間、駐有騎兵四五百名、㊂楊樹浦自定海橋起、至虹口招商局中棧沿江各碼頭之棧房及民房、駐有敵軍五千餘名、</p>
<h3>蕰藻浜僞軍供前驅</h3>
<p>薀藻浜之敵、沿北岸西進、日前已抵胡宅周宅一帶、構築工事、而部隊調動異常忙碌、並多着灰色制服之僞滿軍、被敵調徵前來、供其驅策、胡宅周宅南距廟行約二公里許、敵發動全綫總攻擊、該處亦爲其目標之一、故在胡宅附近配置重砲三四門、迭向我陣地轟擊、但多落田野、並未炸發、我軍檢獲其砲彈上鑄有“中華民國十一年奉天造”之字樣、董係“九一八”時在東三省所盜竊而去者、今竟運來應用、言之殊堪痛心、至該處敵軍又伏於北岸、頻以機槍掃射、希圖壓迫我軍後退、渡河進犯、但我軍憑河固守、敵始終無偸渡之機會、</p>
<h3>我空軍矢忠矢勇不斷飛滬夜襲</h3>
<p>投彈轟炸爆聲極宏　敵應戰耗子彈無算</p>
<p>昨晚九時三刻、我方空軍一隊、突發現於浦江上空、實施夜襲、敵艦倉皇應戰、高射砲及高射機關槍聲、密如貫珠、我空軍由南向北、頻向浦江敵艦及楊樹浦一帶敵軍陣地投彈轟炸、爆聲極宏、至十時十分始歸沉寂、十時卅五分我空軍又來二次夜襲、戰况較第一次爲尤烈、我空軍除投彈轟炸外、更以機槍向敵陣猛烈掃射、一時空中剝剝之聲淸脆可聞、歷一刻鐘始停、待至今晨零時五分、我機二度來襲、目標則側重於楊樹浦一帶、投彈爆發聲與高射砲聲相呼應、激戰歷二十分鐘之久、我機始向南飛去、詎未及一刻鐘滬東敵軍根據地內又突聞連續猛烈之爆炸聲數饗、聲震遐邇、初尚疑係敵軍所發之重砲聲、但未數秒鐘、空軍之飛機聲與敵軍之高射砲聲又同時發作、蓋初起之炸、卽係我空軍所擲之巨量炸彈耳、估計敵經我數度之夜襲所耗之高射砲彈、至少當在一萬數千發以上、又當我空襲戰鬭激烈時、楊橋浦騰越路二號Boiden波登蛋廠有一西人被流彈擊傷、由中央救火會用救護車送院醫治、</p>
<h3>松井限期克我陣地宛如痴人說夢</h3>
<p>誇大心情令人齒冷　我戰鬥力彌增強厚</p>
<p>敵軍總司令松井、以統率海陸空三軍、大舉侵犯淞滬、原期一鼓而下、但自開戰以來、巳達五旬、迭被我軍奮勇痛擊、不但毫無進展、甚且損兵折將、傷亡慘重、不得已乃一面整理部隊、一面請援補充、此項準備工作、巳於日前完竣、松井遂於二十九日晨下令、自卽日起、至十月一日晚間十二時止、（卽昨日）令三軍全綫總攻、限在三天內佔領嘉定·劉河·劉行·大塲·閘北·浦東等處、故兩日來各路戰事、激烈非常、但我軍陣地堅固、將士奮勇萬分、處處予以迎頭痛擊、故截止昨日至、敵軍限期已滿、而其全綫總攻之結果、在羅店·楊行·市中心區·以及江灣閘北一帶、均告失敗、且死傷竟逹六千餘人、敵軍誇大與速戰速决之野心、至是已被我軍粉碎無餘矣、</p>
<h3>敵四次總攻後死傷人數突見增加</h3>
<p>傷兵八百餘今運返日</p>
<p>自敵於上月二十八日起開始作第四次總攻後、不但毫無進展、且又遭我軍堅决抵抗、故近數日來敵軍之死傷人數、復突見增加、敵紅十字艦Haurkaru號因於昨日下午四時左右復行駛滬、停靠招商局北栈、當有敵死傷兵士合約八百餘人抬運上艦、準備於今日駛返日本、</p>
<h3>敵派外交人員來滬圖向外人蠱惑</h3>
<p>以佐藤爲隊長　徒見心勞日拙</p>
<p>本報特訊、記者今向外交界探悉、日本外務省、因監察外交上陷於孤立地位、特派在野外交家、（更在歐美各國任職之外交大員）暨中國通、共有十餘人、特任佐藤爲隊長、巳定於本月三日、乘日輪上海丸出發來滬、進行聯絡上海各國使領、並擬與中國各界領袖周旋、運用外交力量、別有企圖、</p>
<h3>敵機飛浦東幾無虛日</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時許、敵機二架、竟又飛至浦東擲彈轟炸、該處老白渡·小石橋附近、落彈二枚、毀住房數幢、無辜居民七人受傷、死四人、嗣由浦東紅會救護隊將傷者救出醫治、又傍晚五時三刻、敵機一架、飛至浦東上空盤旋數轉、在楊家宅投擲炸彈一枚、復飛至游龍碼頭、連續三次以機槍向下掃射、至六時一刻飛去、又晚五時許、敵機二架、飛度甚低又在浦東春江碼頭上空盤旋偵察、歷時良久、迄至日暮始返惟未投彈、</p>
<p>敵軍一再進攻浦東失敗後、每日僅賴飛機向無辜平民以機槍掃射、並投彈轟炸、惟損害情形、未如外傳之盛、記者昨日午後、晤及浦東紅十字第十救護隊担架長荘榮華氏、承出示該隊半月中紀錄敵機肆虐之確實、統計如下、八月十五日、自晨至晚、飛來敵機九架、擲彈二枚、毀屋一間、有二機用機槍掃射、無損傷、十六日來十七架、六架開機槍、無死傷、十七日來十五架、三架開機槍、死猪隻十八日、來三十架、二架開機槍、無死傷、十九日來十九架、擲彈二枚無損傷二十日來二十四架、三架開機槍、無死傷、二十一日来一架、未投彈、二十二日來二架擲二彈、傷男二、毁一塡山二十三日來二十架擲十七彈傷女子二、毀平房一間、二十四日全日無機、二十五日來五十四架、擲二十三彈、並投石塊、無死傷、二十六日來二十六架、投十四彈、一架開機槍、傷男一女二、死男一、女四、毀平房十五間、二十七日來十五架、投九彈、三架開機槍、無死傷、二十八日來三十一架投四彈、傷男一、女五、死女九、毀平房二十三間、二十九日來三十六架、投四彈、四架開機槍傷男五、女三、死女四、毀平房五間、三十日來十四架投九彈、傷男三、女一、死男五、女二、</p>

<p>上月二十九日上午七時、福興麪粉廠小工蔡子紅·陸有道·爲義大利水兵槍擊事、一死一傷、我市府當局巳向駐滬義總領事提出抗議、此事經過情形、各報尚無詳細紀述、中央社記者昨特向各方調査甚詳、茲分訪詳情如次、</p>
<p>每日過渡迄無阻礙</p>
<p>蔡子紅·陸有道·等四十人、在福興麪粉廠爲夜工、因家住蘇州河南、故由廠方特備渡船往來接送、因人多船小、每分三批過渡、滬戰發生後、領得滬英駐軍司令部特別通行證一張、每日往來、從未發生阻碍、半月前、該處調由義駐軍接防、亦復通行無阻、日久且與駐軍相職、</p>
<p>船在中流突遭槍擊</p>
<p>二十九日晨七時許、第一批小工已安然通過、詎意第二批小工渡至中流、駐該處江蘇藥水廠旁之義軍一名、竟向船上連開三槍、第一槍彈中渡船後艄、幸未傷人、船上十餘工人、見勢不佳、有數人奮不顧身、躍入水中趨避、有七八人、則匐伏船中、當時蔡子紅及陸有道適站立船首、聞槍聲後、亦卽匐伏船面、無奈此時義駐軍之第二第三彈相繼飛來、一自蔡之臀部斜穿向上、已近腹部、並未穿出、一則自陸左足小腿穿過、當卽受傷倒入船艙、肇事後、船依然南駛、停靠華豐麪粉廠前碼頭後、由其他工友携扶上陸、拾至藥水街口、換搭紅十字會救護車、駛往紅十字會醫院、經醫師檢視傷口、蔡子紅因傷在要害、當夜卽行開刀、整理骨節、檢除子彈、但因流血過多、廷至三十日晨三時不治殞命、當由院方於前晨九時車送膠州路騐屍所檢騐、陸有道傷在小腿、經診治後、已可無生命危險、但因流血過多、非半月恐難全愈、</p>
<p>通行證被義兵沒收</p>
<p>此事發生後、駐防之義軍小隊長某、曾赴福新廠聲明係出諸誤會、福興廠亦派沈瑞麟氏前往調査、以便交涉、昨日該廠又有一部工人渡河、出示通行證後、該地義駐軍忽謂彼等不識英文、遂將其沒收、並謂由渠携往義駐軍司令部請司令簽宇、或由義司令部另行發給、在通行證未發出前、暫准自由通行、昨日下午、該廠復派沈瑞麟氏前往領取通行證其司令請須待商量發給、故尚未領得、</p>
<p>市府向贛提出抗講</p>
<p>本市市政當局、對於此事亦頗注意、以此事發生、係在清晨、並非深夜戒嚴時間、該義兵如欲阻止其登岸、儘有適當辦法、何至巳准其第一批渡河小工登岸之後、對該第二批靠岸之小船、忽措施射擊、致使職業小工、無故慘遭殺害、認義兵此種舉措、殊非兩國邦交素稱敦睦者所宜出、故巳根據上述理由、向駐滬義總領事提出抗議、請迅將此案之肇事員兵、査明懲處、並聲明保留一切要求損害賠償之權、</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>今年的棉花問題</h3>
<p>— 章乃器</p>
<p>爲了要進行中日經濟提携，便想把中國變成產棉國；爲了要把中國變成產棉國，便儘量發動金融力量，向棉花押款膨脹；這是過去的事情。但是就因爲金融力量向棉花膨脹，便有今年棉花生產的過剩。</p>
<p>在中日經濟提携高倡入雲的時候，我曾經幾次的著文反對。我那時候所提出的有兩點：</p>
<p>第一，在國防的意義之下，我們不能再使種糧食的田地改種棉花；否則一旦海岸被封鎖，我們將不敗於戰爭而敗於飢餓。</p>
<p>第二，就放開國防不談，我們也不能再使我們的農產國際商品化。我們沒有海軍力量保護海外市塲，國際貿易上的利益是可遇而不可求的·遠一些古巴的糖和巴西的咖啡，大恐慌以後國際市塲杜塞，只好拋棄到海洋裹去，近一些我國的生絲出口，因爲受日絲的壓迫，一落千丈，只好砍了桑樹當柴燒，都是前車之鑒·所以，我們還是多種一些自足自給的糧食，而不必想在農產國際商品化上面發橫財。</p>
<p>目下的棉花問題，便是國際商品化的問題；而目下棉花問題之所以特別嚴重，便是因爲在國防意義之下，我們不能再把過多的金融力量，安排在棉花押款上去。</p>
<p>今年的棉花產量，是一千九百六十萬擔；倘使平均以三十元一擔收買（最近還有人以平均每擔四十元估計；但目下有些地方的籽花價格，已慘跌至十元以內，則熟花收價，自决不能有如是之高。）就差不多要動用六萬萬的資金。棉花的生產，差不多是全部商品化的。那一個農民種棉花是爲着供自己消費的呢？因此，在調整棉花的工作上面，我們不能不以全部收買爲前提；這才需要偌大的資金。糧食的問題就不同，全部糧食生產的價值，自然比棉花大得多；然而商品化的部分，恐怕還沒有棉花那麼多。所以，從國防的較容易調整的農產。</p>
<p>因爲戰爭的爆發，國內四分之三上的紗廠停了工；再因爲海岸的被封鎖，出口變成極端的困難。因此，有人估計今後一年間的銷數，連少數的出口在內，至多只能有八百萬擔。那樣，卽使明年的產量打一個對折，後年的產量再打一個對折，陳陳相因的棉花存貨要經常的在一千萬擔以上，繼績至三四年之久。那就是說：這六萬萬元的收集棉花款項，大半要變成長期呆帳。現在急如星火的軍需用款是那樣的多，我們那裹能有這偌大的閑資去囤積這種不急之物呢？</p>
<p>中國的棉產，內銷的本來一小半依賴日紗廠的購買，而出口的却全數依賴日本的市塲簡單的說，是敵人可以隨時制我們的死命的。這種向敵人賣身投靠的農業政策，到抗戰時期要碰壁，自然是不成問題的。這一個毒辣的陰謀，這一服經濟提携的毒藥，幸虧抗戰發動還不太遲，幸虧我們吃下去還不很多：否則曠日持久，再讓產量增加一倍，那我們就眞只有死路一條了！</p>
<p>過去的事不必多談了，且想想今後的辦法吧。從國防的直接意義來講，我們固然不能重視棉花市塲的調整；然而，爲農民生計着想，我們又不能不很嚴重的考慮這個問題。我們明知不應該在抗戰時期中把有限的資金在囤積不急需的棉花，然而爲培養民力起見，又不能對種棉的農民坐視不救，這才是最痛苦的事情。依照目下的形勢，恐怕將來的發展必然是農民吃大虧忍痛脫手，而政府還要費大力忍痛救濟。目下海外棉價大跌，孟買粗絨花市價僅合國幣二十元一担；所以，種棉的人對於去年的市價，是不能再去憧憬他了。爲了使明年的棉產自然减少，恐怕在政策上也要使種棉的人比種糧的人吃虧；所以，調整中預定的價格，决不能和去年的棉價比較，而只能和今年的糧價比較，如果種糧食的每畝的收入是十元，種棉花的必然要使他少於十元。</p>
<p>收押的方法，最好是勸導農民自動的組織起來借款聯合會，直接向金融機關請求抵押，以免居間人從中上下其手。國家銀行除了開放轉抵押門戶鼓勵商業銀行及錢莊承受抵押外，最好再多委託這些私人金融機構爲代理處，以資推廣。農產調整機關除了帮同農民組機借款聯合會之外，還要替他們解决運銷問題和一般技術問題。抵押的時候，可以照假定價格打七折：押餘的三成，等賣了之後後。我認爲抵押的範圍要普及，而抵押的價值却不必高；目下最緊要的是給農民　一些希望和一些救急的資金。並不一定要一次給他們很多的。</p>
<p>據説，將來在打包和儲藏方面，恐怕還要發生很大的困難。出口和凖備長期偕藏的棉花，必須機器壓榨包裝；否則出口的裝船不便，而儲藏的不但所占地位過大，而且也易於着火。但是，壓榨包裝所需的材料如蔴袋，鐵皮等，目下均感缺乏；還就了棉花的需要，或者便要妨碍軍事的需要。同樣的，因爲軍事上的需要，我們必須囤積大量的糧秣，我們就需用多數的倉庫；但是，大量棉花的儲藏，就要使倉庫容量不容易安排。</p>
<p>總之，一切的一切，我們都受了中日經濟提携之賜！這一個亡國的農業政策，使我們增長了嚴重的內部矛盾；使我們顧到國防，就幾乎顧不到農村經濟。然而，這還算不幸中之幸，我們不曾因此亡國。我們一面咬緊牙關，忍受着這種痛苦，一面還要知道，而且要使大衆知道，這一部份的痛苦是妥洽政策所造成的。我們要自拔於奴隸經濟，永遠不再受這種痛苦，便只有排除一切的妥洽論，抗戰到底，以達到最後的勝利。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>對侵略者的制裁</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>我全民族抵抗殘暴的侵略者的神聖戰爭。顯然已便有利的國際局勢逐漸開展了。</p>
<p>上月二十一日蘇聯外長李維諾夫在國聯大會大聲疾呼。要求世界和平國家對侵略國實行集體制裁。二十八日國聯五十二國又一致决議譴責日本轟炸中國平民。而美國務部則除對此項决議表示贊同外。最近並向國聯表示。“美政府確信世界各國合作的原則。並願設法促使國際衝突的和平解决。國聯若有確切的建議提供美國。則美國極願予以慎重的考慮。”於此可見美國的態度。還是很積極的。</p>
<p>現在全世界愛護正義和平的人士都切望着實施制裁侵路者的有效辦法。可是由於國際間種種的矛盾。前途的阻礙還是很多。</p>
<p>舉個例罷。英國保守黨政府對於我國當然是極端同情的。可是它的顧慮很多。一直沒有切實制裁日本的决心。這就使遠東侵略者的野心很不容易制止了。</p>
<p>最近英國民衆方面排斥日貨運動有着迅速的發展。這多少有利於遠東大局。也是我們深所欣慰的。我們期望着這種民意能夠促使。英國政府爲遠東永久的和平。採取堅决的積極的步驟。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>市中心區蘊藻浜一帶敵軍。昨日突然撤退。企圖不明。殊為奇怪。以我度之。不外三點。㊀我軍防綫鞏固。敵無法突破擬用誘敵深入之策。使我軍深入。三面夾擊。或埋伏地雷等危險物。使我軍身受重創。㊁敵軍十五六萬。相持五六十日。亳無進展。不免垂頭喪氣。而華北方面。我軍因人事及某種關係。平漢津浦兩路。及晋北各地。均不免缩短陣綫因此敵方戰綫廷長。并且我方精銳部隊。逐漸北上。敵方防禦方面。感覺空虛。與其“大軍十萬。頓兵堅城。”不若抽調其一部份。增防華北。萬一華北失利。則敵人全功盡棄矣。㊂據駐京某大使館傳出消息。德義兩領袖會晤時。曾決定勸日迅速設法。停止侵華軍事。以免消費實力過巨。影響此後共同行動。言外之音已可概見。卽敵人亦未始不顧盧及此。除此三端而外。决無其他奇計妙策也。</p>

<h3>青年模範</h3>
<p>— 夢梅</p>
<p>抗戰開始後，全國上下，均能一致對外，——漢奸當然是例外——貢獻着一切的力量，為國家民族爭生存。尤其使人肅然起敬的，是一般尚在童年的小朋友，他们的愛國熱忱，往往超過了一般青年和成人！</p>
<p>喏！這就是一個最有力的證據：</p>
<p>‘這幾天我看見報紙，知道日本的飛機，轟炸我們的各處地方，所以我就問爸爸取了一只軍用千里眼鏡，請你代我送給前方的將士，好給他們看清楚敵人飛機，就用高射砲去打碎牠啊！此上</p>
<p>前敵總指揮官</p>
<p>郇光小學三年級學生何秀美敬上九月廿二日’</p>
<p>諸位看了這件事和這封信作何感想？依我想，她·除了具有愛國熱忱外，還具備着因見飛機轟炸而立刻想到利用望遠鏡偵察飛機的聰慧，眞是我們的模範呢！</p>
<h3>懷疑病</h3>
<p>— 元生</p>
<p>在滬戰未爆發之前夜，我們曾聽到許多青年人的顧慮與躊躇。有人懷疑我們的武力够不上敵人；有人焦慮我們的內部要發生紛歧，有人着急我們的軍費没有辦法。但这顧慮，這躊躇，在大砲聲一響後，卽完全打消了。</p>
<p>事實是最偉大的辯論者。你們看！這四十多天來的上海血戰的成續：</p>
<p>停泊在黃浦江內的敵艦，被炸燬了好多艘，飛往京滬間的敵機，被擊落了近百架，連號稱最精銳的久留米師團，也打剩了三分之一。這，可以證明，我們的武力，是並不比人家壞，同時所謂‘赫赫有名’的皇軍，也不過如此而已。</p>
<p>自抗戰開始後，無論處於什麽階級的人，都覺得興奮：無論懷着甚麽思想的人，都團結了起來。（像紅军　改編為國民軍，卽是一例。）這，可以證明，焦慮我們內部紛歧的人的觀念的錯誤。</p>
<p>至於說到軍費，我敢相信，中國至少是比日本少担憂些，假定日本能維持一年，則中國即可維持三年，五年，甚至十年，八年。所以要說中國軍費沒有辦法，除非日本的經濟先崩潰，先破產，那才會有人相信。</p>
<p>的確，‘事實’是最偉大的辯論者，牠能醫治青年人的‘懷疑病’：牠也能說服，戰勝一切詭辯的言論，以及一切無謂的顧慮。</p>
<p>青年們、戰時的青年們！今日，我們對於自己的國家：要絕對信任；無論在軍事上，政治上，以及整個國策上，應絲毫不該懷疑，絲毫不該顧慮我們只知奉行四句口號：</p>
<p>“服從政府，信仰領袖，犧牲到底，抗戰到底”！</p>

<h3>Enemy Retreats from City Center, Fierce Battle at Liu Hang by the River, Enemy Casualties Astonishingly High</h3>
<p>Enemy Regimental Commander Killed at Gujiazhai, Soldiers Wounded or Killed Number 600  Enemy Attacks Shi Xiangong Temple in Luodian, Are Repelled Our Air Force Continuously Raids Enemy Positions Last Night, Inflicting Heavy Damage Our Troops Make Progress in Zhabei Positions</p>
<p>Since the enemy issued the order for the fourth general offensive on the morning of the 29th of last month, they immediately used fresh troops, under the cover of airplanes, artillery, and tanks, to launch assaults on our entire line of defense. Our troops, resting in anticipation of the attack, calmly engaged the enemy, inflicting casualties across the battlefield. The stubborn enemy, caught between advancing and retreating, could not cross the line. They then resorted to continuous shelling of our entire line with intense artillery fire, attempting to destroy our defensive fortifications first before occupying them at their leisure. In the past twenty-four hours, the enemy fired at least several thousand shells. However, the damage to our frontline fortifications was minimal, and there was absolutely no change to the entire line of defense, proving that the enemy had exhausted their tricks. The following is a frontline report obtained by this newspaper at three o'clock this morning: ① The fighting near Liu Hang was the most intense. The enemy and our forces were facing each other across the Di Jing River. The enemy had repeatedly attempted to cross the river secretly in the past few days, but were repelled each time. Yesterday morning, the main force of the enemy, under the cover of a large number of tanks, launched a flanking attack on Liu Hang. Our troops bravely engaged them, and the enemy also put up a stubborn resistance. The fighting is still ongoing. ② In the Gujiazhai area, in order to support the military operations near Liu Hang, the enemy also launched a major offensive. Twenty enemy soldiers even broke into our position at one point, but were quickly wiped out by our encirclement and attack. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle, and our troops achieved a great victory. The enemy continued to attack last night, and the fierce fighting has not stopped. ③ In the Luodian area, the enemy attempted to break through our defense line around Shi Xiangong Temple but were forced into a disorderly retreat after several interceptions by our forces. ④ In the Zhabei area, our defensive lines continued to advance, and the remaining enemy forces on Fusheng Road have been completely eliminated. ⑤ The enemy forces in the western area of the city center have indeed retreated, seemingly to redeploy their troops to participate in the fighting on the Luodian-Liu Hang line. Our troops are closely searching for the remaining enemy forces and gradually advancing forward.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Attack Gujiazhai Twice Under Cover of Artillery Fire, Suffering Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>Regimental Commander Suzuki Killed, More Than 600 Soldiers Wounded or Killed</p>
<p>Since the enemy launched their fourth general offensive, fierce fighting has been unfolding along the entire line for four days. Although there have been constant skirmishes in Jiangwan and Zhabei, the main forces of both sides are still concentrated on the Luodian-Liu Hang line, so the fighting is also the most intense in these two sectors. At Shi Xiangong Temple, northwest of Luodian, the enemy has concentrated artillery fire on our positions for the past two days. The night before last, the enemy used a regiment-sized force to repeatedly assault our positions. Our troops fought bravely, inflicting countless casualties on the enemy, who were ultimately unsuccessful. The enemy on the Liu Hang front repeatedly attacked our Gujiazhai positions yesterday and the day before. After continuous bombing by enemy artillery and aircraft, a large contingent of enemy troops broke into our warning line yesterday morning. Our troops rose up to engage them, delivering a severe blow. The attacking enemy suffered countless casualties, and the remaining enemy forces are still stubbornly resisting from fortified positions. Fierce fighting continued from yesterday morning to evening. Although enemy artillery never stopped firing, our positions suffered no damage. News received from the front this morning indicates that the enemy attacking Gujiazhai is showing signs of collapse.</p>
<p>Two Attacks on Gujiazhai, More Than 600 Casualties</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a war correspondent reported at 6:00 PM on the 1st that enemy forces attacked Gujiazhai, southeast of Liu Hang, again at 11:00 PM last night (the 30th). They first bombarded with artillery. Our troops remained silent, feigning unpreparedness. The enemy then deployed over a hundred infantry to break through the barbed wire and approach our front. At this moment, our troops suddenly opened fire with machine guns and simultaneously leapt out from both sides to encircle them. The enemy troops, unable to escape, were completely annihilated by us. After suffering this devastating blow, the enemy began relentlessly bombarding our positions with artillery from 2:00 AM to 10:00 AM on the 1st, without stopping. However, our positions remained unshaken, and the fortifications were not damaged at all.</p>
<p>According to reports received by our military authorities, enemy forces bombarded our Gujiazhai positions continuously with artillery and aircraft yesterday morning. At about 9:00 AM, more than a thousand enemy infantry attacked our positions with extreme ferocity. Our troops responded calmly, first opening fire on the enemy with machine guns to inflict heavy casualties, then infantry leapt out to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. During the fierce fighting that lasted until noon, enemy Regimental Commander Suzuki Hachiro was killed by our forces, and the enemy, suffering excessive casualties, retreated in disarray. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 500 casualties, and we killed five officers, and captured many rifles and machine guns.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Focus on Attacking Luodian and Liu Hang</p>
<p>Luodian and Liu Hang are connected by the Hu-Tai Highway to support both flanks, so Liu Hang is militarily important. The area is riddled with ditches, the main one being the Di Jing River. To avoid significant losses, we are firmly defending the west bank of the river, and most of the highway is west of our warning line. However, starting at the town of Liu Hang, the road juts out eastward, about one kilometer long, to the vicinity of Yinjiage, where they intersect, so that section is quite precarious. Our troops have constructed deep trenches and strong fortifications to defend it very tightly.</p>
<p>Three Attempts to Cross the River, All Ending in Failure for the Enemy</p>
<p>The night before last, the enemy, with more than twenty tanks and over two thousand infantry, attacked the warning line of one of our battalions at Zhoujiaxiang and Xiwangzhai, northeast of Liu Hang, but were valiantly intercepted by our troops and ultimately failed. At the same time, over a thousand enemy troops moved north, attempting to cross the river near Yinjiage, but were met by our troops and retreated with injuries. Near Guoxiangqiao, between Luodian and Liu Hang, enemy troops also attempted to cross the river, but were intercepted and killed by us, suffering heavy casualties, and ultimately failed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Suddenly Retreat from the City Center</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops North of Yunzaobang Also Retreat, Most Concentrating at the Qiujiang Wharf</p>
<p>The enemy in the city center had been busy constructing fortifications along the Songhu Road, but starting on the 29th, their troops suddenly moved back. Our troops initially thought that the enemy was gathering forces to attack us. The day before yesterday, the enemy launched fierce artillery fire at our positions, and our troops were ordered to be on high alert, waiting for the battle to begin. However, apart from some skirmishes with sentries, the front lines were unusually quiet the previous night. Our troops were deeply surprised, so yesterday morning, as a preemptive measure, we launched a sudden attack at dawn. The enemy outposts were in extreme disarray and fled towards the city center. In an instant, there were no traces of the enemy in front of our positions. Our troops immediately advanced and sent troops to reconnoiter, but the land was quiet, and there was no trace of anyone. The Japanese are full of tricks, and it is unknown what they are planning to do next. According to reports from war correspondents with the Central News Agency, over two thousand enemy troops in the city center and north of Yunzaobang retreated in two directions towards Yangshupu and Wusong, with unclear intentions. Our troops are searching and advancing.</p>
<p>According to a midnight report, the enemy entrenched at Jinjiaxiang, Dijiabang, Youshagang, and Wujiazhai southeast of Jiangwan Sijing Stadium and at Qimei Road and Huangxing Road in the city center mostly retreated from yesterday afternoon and concentrated at Qiujiang Wharf.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Retreat from Jiangwan and Zhabei</h3>
<p>Part of Our Army Has Occupied the Area</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 1st: According to reliable information from the front, the enemy near Jinjiaxiang, Dijiabang, Youshagang, and Wujiazhai in the southeast of Jiangwan had completely retreated by 5:00 PM on the 30th. Also, the enemy near Tanjiazhen (at the corner of the Shuidian Road bend) and at Xitangwan Zhangjiaxiang in Zhabei retreated at the same time. Part of our army has now occupied the area.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attempt to Assault Zhabei Repelled</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy has repeatedly harassed the Zhabei area, but have been defeated each time. Yesterday morning, the enemy's artillery continuously bombarded our positions, and starting at 1:00 PM, enemy troops also engaged in large-scale activities. Enemy tanks were seen assembling at the intersections of North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road, Qiujiang Road, and Baoxing Road. At around 4:30 PM, two companies of enemy troops, under the cover of tanks, charged in from the Qiujiang Road intersection. Our troops jumped onto the buildings along the street, taking a commanding position, and launched a fierce attack on the enemy and their tanks with light machine guns and hand grenades. The enemy troops were caught off guard and dared not advance further. Our troops seized the opportunity to press forward, and by about 7:00 PM, the enemy finally could not hold out and retreated. In this battle, the enemy suffered over fifty casualties, and one of their tanks was destroyed by us and is beyond repair.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy acted rashly in Zhabei all day yesterday. In the morning, the enemy used several tanks to charge at our positions from the Qiujiang Road intersection, but were repelled. At around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the enemy returned, with several tanks covering a company of enemy troops, and attacked our positions in the area of Baoxing Road and Qiujiang Road. Our troops opened fire with machine guns. The enemy on Baoxing Road knew that the situation was hopeless after only fifteen minutes of fighting and retreated. The enemy on Qiujiang Road tried to put up a stubborn resistance, but our troops engaged them in a fierce hand-to-hand battle, killing over ten enemy soldiers. By about 3:00 PM, the enemy troops in that area also used their tanks as a rear guard and retreated in silence.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, at 7:00 PM last night, several enemy tanks were quite active at the southern end of North Sichuan Road, seemingly with other intentions, which warrants attention. We have been on high alert.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces on Fusheng Road Cleared</h3>
<p>We have long had tight defenses at the northern end of Baoshan Road at the North Railway Station. Although it was where the war began, our troops have held their original positions and have not changed. In the many narrow alleys, the enemy often launched sneak attacks, but were repelled by our machine guns and small mortars. Hand-to-hand combat and charges have occurred countless times. The night before last, our troops selected elite units to carry out a night attack. The enemy troops entrenched in our civilian houses at the northern end of Bazi Road were very alarmed when they saw us attacking. The enemy had machine guns deployed at the intersections of Fusheng Road and Herschel Road, ready to defend. Our troops were extremely vigilant. Some of them advanced in the dark, and when they got close to the firing line, they broke through the houses, went over them, and advanced directly to the rear of the enemy machine gun positions, attacking the enemy with hand grenades. The rest of the troops also launched machine gun attacks, killing many enemy soldiers. The remaining enemy soldiers abandoned their weapons and fled. Now there are no traces of the enemy at the Baixing Grand Theater on Fusheng Road, etc.</p>
<h3>Enemy Wastes Ammunition in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday in Zhabei, the enemy's artillery and aircraft continued to bombard. A place not far from the western end of Maohai Road was targeted by enemy aircraft, and no fewer than twenty bombs were dropped there. Since the enemy launched their general offensive, the targets of their air raids have been chaotic. All high-rise buildings have become their targets, and each time they drop two or four bombs at the same time. But because our anti-aircraft fire is fierce, they do not dare to fly low, and they drop them arbitrarily in the high sky, with no military effect. The waste of ammunition is obvious. According to our garrison, the enemy dropped no less than a hundred bombs in two days, and our troops suffered only twenty-one minor injuries.</p>
<h3>Most Enemy Warships Sail to Liuhe</h3>
<p>Starting last night, some of the enemy warships anchored in the river suddenly sailed out of the river one after another and anchored in the waters around Liuhe. There were especially many destroyers among them. Judging from the situation, it seems that they have some plans for our area. According to the investigation conducted by this reporter this morning, there are currently a total of nineteen enemy ships anchored in the river, of which only two are destroyers, one anchored at buoy number eight, and one anchored at buoy number one off the Lujiazui riverfront. In addition to seven transport ships and the Izumo flagship, the remaining nine ships are all gunboats.</p>
<h3>All 40,000 Enemy Reinforcements Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The enemy's fourth reinforcement, one division and one brigade, totaling more than 40,000 men, has been continuously arriving in Shanghai in recent days, and the total number has reached about 35,000. They began their fourth general offensive on the 28th. From 7:00 AM to 8:00 AM yesterday morning, enemy merchant ships converted into transport ships, including the No. 52 transport ship Ikushimaru, the No. 136 transport ship Kaiheimaru, the No. 46 transport ship Akishimaru, the No. 266 transport ship Zenyomaru, the No. 262 transport ship Taianmaru, and the No. 170 transport ship Sohyomaru, totaling six ships, successively sailed into Shanghai and docked at the Osaka, Huangpu, and Hushan wharves. It is said that the last batch of the enemy's fourth reinforcements, about 6,000 people, also landed at that time.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Enemy Troops in Yangshupu</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from this newspaper, military news: According to intelligence reports, ① At the end of Taopeng Road in Yangshupu, north of Yaojiaqiao in the Chinese district, and south of Xiaohuang Temple, there are many tents and enemy troops stationed there, about 6,000 people, all of whom have been transferred back from the front to rest. They are all very exhausted. ② There are five buildings at the Qiujiang Wharf. One in the middle stores a large amount of ammunition. One to the north houses more than two hundred warhorses. One to the south houses four or five hundred cavalrymen. ③ There are enemy troops stationed in the warehouses and civilian houses along the river from Dinghai Bridge in Yangshupu to the China Merchants Bureau Central Wharf in Hongkou, totaling more than 5,000 people.</p>
<h3>Pseudo-Troops in Yunzaobang Serve as the Vanguard</h3>
<p>The enemy in Yunzaobang, advancing west along the north bank, has reached the Hutai and Zhoutai areas and are constructing fortifications. Their troops are being transferred and mobilized in an exceptionally busy manner, and many pseudo-Manchukuo troops wearing gray uniforms have been conscripted by the enemy and brought here to serve as their vanguard. Hutai and Zhoutai are located about two kilometers south of Miaohang. The enemy is launching a general offensive along the entire line, and this area is also one of their targets. Therefore, three or four heavy artillery pieces have been deployed near Hutai, repeatedly bombarding our positions. However, most of the shells have fallen in the fields and have not detonated. Our troops have recovered shells with the words "Made in Fengtian in the 11th Year of the Republic of China" cast on them, meaning that they were stolen from the three northeastern provinces during the "September 18th Incident" and are now being used here, which is truly heartbreaking. The enemy troops in the area are also lying in ambush on the north bank, frequently spraying machine gun fire, hoping to force our troops to retreat, cross the river, and attack. But our troops are firmly defending the river, and the enemy has no opportunity to cross it secretly.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force, Loyal and Courageous, Continuously Flies to Shanghai for Night Raids</h3>
<p>Bombs Dropped, Explosions Extremely Loud Enemy Responds, Wasting Countless Bullets</p>
<p>At 9:45 last night, a squadron of our air force suddenly appeared in the skies over the Huangpu River, carrying out a night raid. Enemy warships responded in panic, and the sounds of anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns were as dense as a string of beads. Our air force flew from south to north, frequently dropping bombs and bombing enemy warships on the Huangpu River and enemy positions in the Yangshupu area. The explosions were extremely loud. The area became quiet at 10:10. At 10:35, our air force returned for a second night raid, and the battle situation was even more intense than the first. In addition to dropping bombs and bombing, our air force also fired machine guns fiercely at enemy positions. For a time, the sound of the aircraft's gunfire was crisp and clear. The air force ceased fire after a quarter of an hour. Then at 0:05 this morning, our planes attacked for the third time, focusing on the Yangshupu area. The sound of the bombs exploding echoed the sound of anti-aircraft guns. The fierce fighting lasted for twenty minutes, and our planes flew south. In less than a quarter of an hour, there was a series of continuous and violent explosions in the enemy's base in eastern Shanghai, shaking the area far and wide. At first, it was suspected to be the sound of heavy artillery fire from the enemy, but within seconds, the sound of the air force's planes and the sound of the enemy's anti-aircraft guns started at the same time. It turned out that the initial explosions were the huge bombs dropped by our air force. It is estimated that the enemy has used at least ten thousand anti-aircraft shells during our several night raids. Also, when our air raids were intense, a Westerner at the Boiden Egg Factory at 2 Tengyue Road in Yangqiaopu was wounded by stray bullets and was sent to the hospital for treatment by the Central Fire Brigade in an ambulance.</p>
<h3>Matsui's Deadline to Conquer Our Positions is Just a Fool's Dream</h3>
<p>Exaggerated Sentiments Make People Cringe Our Combat Power Grows Stronger</p>
<p>Enemy Commander-in-Chief Matsui, commanding the army, navy, and air force, launched a large-scale invasion of Shanghai, originally hoping to take it in one fell swoop, but since the start of the war, fifty days have passed, and he has repeatedly been dealt fierce blows by our brave troops. Not only has there been no progress, but he has also lost soldiers and generals, suffering heavy casualties. In desperation, he has been reorganizing his troops and requesting reinforcements. This preparatory work was completed a few days ago, and Matsui issued an order on the morning of the 29th, starting immediately and ending at 12:00 PM on October 1st (yesterday), ordering the three armies to launch a general offensive along the entire line, with a deadline of three days to occupy Jiading, Liuhe, Liuhang, Dachang, Zhabei, Pudong, etc. Therefore, the fighting on all fronts has been extremely fierce for the past two days. However, our positions are solid, and our soldiers are extremely brave, dealing the enemy heavy blows everywhere. Therefore, as of yesterday, the enemy's deadline has passed, and the results of their general offensive along the entire line in the Luodian, Yanghang, City Center, Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, have all failed, and deaths and injuries have reached more than 6,000 people. The enemy's exaggeration and their ambition for a quick victory have been completely shattered by our army.</p>
<h3>The Number of Deaths and Injuries After the Enemy's Fourth General Offensive Suddenly Increases</h3>
<p>More Than 800 Wounded Soldiers Transported Back to Japan Today</p>
<p>Since the enemy began their fourth general offensive on the 28th of last month, not only has there been no progress, but they have also encountered determined resistance from our troops. Therefore, the number of deaths and injuries among enemy troops in recent days has suddenly increased again. The enemy Red Cross ship Haurkaru sailed to Shanghai again at about 4:00 PM yesterday and docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Wharf. Approximately 800 wounded and dead enemy soldiers were carried onto the ship, preparing to sail back to Japan today.</p>
<h3>Enemy Sends Diplomatic Personnel to Shanghai, Attempting to Deceive Foreigners</h3>
<p>Led by Sato, it is a Futile Effort</p>
<p>Special dispatch from this newspaper, this reporter has learned from diplomatic circles that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, because they are in an isolated diplomatic position, has specially dispatched more than ten retired diplomats (senior diplomats who have served in various European and American countries) and China experts, with Sato specially appointed as the leader. They are scheduled to depart for Shanghai on the Japanese ship Shanghai Maru on the 3rd of this month, to contact the envoys of various countries in Shanghai and to engage with leaders from all walks of life in China, attempting to use diplomatic means to achieve other objectives.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Fly to Pudong Almost Every Day</h3>
<p>At about 3:00 PM yesterday, two enemy planes flew to Pudong again to drop bombs. Two bombs landed near Laobai Ferry and Xiaoshi Bridge, destroying several houses and wounding seven innocent residents, killing four. The injured were rescued and treated by the Pudong Red Cross rescue team. Also, at 5:45 PM in the evening, one enemy plane flew to Pudong, circling several times in the sky, dropping a bomb in Yangjiazhai, and then flew to Youlong Wharf, continuously strafing downwards with machine guns three times, before flying away at 6:15. Also, at around 5:00 PM in the evening, two enemy planes flew very low and circled and reconnoitered over Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong for a long time, returning only at dusk without dropping bombs.</p>
<p>After the enemy's repeated attacks on Pudong failed, they rely solely on aircraft to strafe innocent civilians and drop bombs. However, the extent of the damage is not as great as rumored. Yesterday afternoon, this reporter met with Zhuang Ronghua, the stretcher captain of the 10th Rescue Team of the Pudong Red Cross, who provided accurate records of the enemy planes wreaking havoc over the past half month. The statistics are as follows: August 15th, from morning to night, nine enemy planes flew over, dropping two bombs, destroying one house. Two planes used machine guns, but there were no injuries. 16th, 17 planes came, 6 opened fire, no deaths or injuries. 17th, 15 planes came, 3 opened fire, killing pigs. 18th, 30 planes came, 2 opened fire, no deaths or injuries. 19th, 19 planes came, 2 bombs dropped with no damage. 20th, 24 planes came, 3 opened fire, no deaths or injuries. 21st, 1 plane came, no bombs dropped. 22nd, 2 planes dropped two bombs, injuring 2 males, destroying one Tien Shan. 23rd, 20 planes dropped 17 bombs, injuring two women, destroying one bungalow. 24th, no planes all day. 25th, 54 planes came, dropped 23 bombs, and threw stones, no deaths or injuries. 26th, 26 planes came, dropped 14 bombs, one plane opened fire, injuring 1 male and 2 females, killing 1 male and 4 females, destroying 15 bungalows. 27th, 15 planes came, dropped 9 bombs, 3 opened fire, no deaths or injuries. 28th, 31 planes came, dropped 4 bombs, injuring 1 male and 5 females, killing 9 females, destroying 23 bungalows. 29th, 36 planes came, dropped 4 bombs, 4 opened fire, injuring 5 males and 3 females, killing 4 females, destroying 5 bungalows. 30th, 14 planes came, dropped 9 bombs, injuring 3 males and 1 female, killing 5 males and 2 females.</p>
<h3>Municipality Protests Incident of Italian Soldiers Shooting Workers; Cai Zihong Dies from Severe Injuries</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 29th of last month, at 7:00 AM, Cai Zihong and Lu Youdao, workers at the Fuxing Flour Mill, were shot by Italian soldiers, resulting in one death and one injury. The Municipal Government has lodged a protest with the Italian Consul General in Shanghai. Detailed accounts of the incident have not been published in the newspapers. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency conducted a thorough investigation, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Daily Crossings Unobstructed</p>
<p>Cai Zihong, Lu Youdao, and forty other workers were employed as night workers at the Fuxing Flour Mill. Because they lived on the south bank of the Suzhou River, the factory provided a ferry for their transportation. Due to the large number of workers and the small size of the boat, they crossed in three batches. After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, they obtained a special pass from the Shanghai British Military Headquarters. They crossed daily without any obstruction. Half a month ago, the area was taken over by Italian troops, and their crossings remained unobstructed. Over time, they became familiar with the stationed troops.</p>
<p>Boat Shot at in Mid-Stream</p>
<p>Around 7:00 AM on the 29th, the first batch of workers had already crossed safely. Unexpectedly, as the second batch of workers was crossing mid-stream, an Italian soldier stationed near the Jiangsu Pharmaceutical Factory opened fire on the boat, firing three shots in rapid succession. The first shot hit the stern of the boat, fortunately without injuring anyone. Upon seeing the situation, several of the dozen or so workers on board bravely jumped into the water to escape. Seven or eight workers lay prostrate in the boat. At the time, Cai Zihong and Lu Youdao were standing at the bow of the boat. After hearing the gunshots, they also immediately lay down on the deck. However, the Italian soldier's second and third shots followed, one passing diagonally upward through Cai's buttocks, nearly reaching his abdomen, without exiting; the other passing through Lu's left calf. Both were immediately injured and fell into the boat's cabin. After the incident, the boat continued south, docking in front of the Huafeng Flour Mill's wharf. Other workers helped them ashore. They were taken to the mouth of Yaoshui Street and transferred to a Red Cross ambulance, which took them to the Red Cross Hospital. After examining the wounds, the doctor determined that Cai Zihong's injury was critical. He underwent surgery that night to reset the bones and remove the bullet. However, due to excessive blood loss, he died at 3:00 AM on the 30th. At 9:00 AM the following morning, the hospital sent his body to the Jiaozhou Road morgue for examination. Lu Youdao's leg was injured, but after treatment, his life was no longer in danger, but it will take half a month to recover due to blood loss.</p>
<p>Pass Confiscated by Italian Soldiers</p>
<p>After the incident, the Italian platoon leader stationed there went to the Fuxing Flour Mill and stated that it was a misunderstanding. Fuxing Factory also sent Mr. Shen Ruilin to investigate to facilitate negotiations. Yesterday, a group of workers from the factory crossed the river again. After showing their passes, the Italian troops there suddenly said that they did not recognize English and confiscated them. They said that they would take them to the Italian Military Headquarters to have the commander sign them or that the Italian Headquarters would issue new ones. Before the passes were issued, they were temporarily allowed to pass freely. Yesterday afternoon, the factory again sent Mr. Shen Ruilin to retrieve the passes, but the commander said he needed to discuss the matter before issuing them, so they have not yet been obtained.</p>
<p>Municipality Protests to the Italian Consulate</p>
<p>The municipal authorities are paying close attention to this incident. The incident occurred in the early morning, not during curfew hours. If the Italian soldiers wanted to prevent them from landing, there were appropriate measures to take. Why, after allowing the first batch of workers to land, did they suddenly open fire on the second batch of small boats approaching the shore, causing innocent workers to be brutally killed? They believe that this action by the Italian soldiers is not appropriate for countries that have traditionally maintained amicable relations. Therefore, based on the above reasons, a protest has been lodged with the Italian Consul General in Shanghai, requesting a swift investigation and punishment of the soldiers responsible for this incident, and reserving all rights to claim compensation for damages.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>This Year's Cotton Problem</h3>
<p>— Zhang Naiqi</p>
<p>In order to promote economic cooperation between China and Japan, they wanted to turn China into a cotton-producing country; in order to turn China into a cotton-producing country, they mobilized financial resources to inflate cotton loans; this is what happened in the past. However, it is because of the financial resources inflated into cotton that there is a surplus of cotton production this year.</p>
<p>When economic cooperation between China and Japan was being promoted to the skies, I wrote several articles against it. I raised two points at that time:</p>
<p>First, from a national defense perspective, we cannot allow land used for growing food to be converted to growing cotton; otherwise, once the coast is blockaded, we will be defeated not by war, but by starvation.</p>
<p>Second, even without considering national defense, we cannot further internationalize our agricultural products as commodities. We do not have the naval power to protect overseas markets, and the benefits of international trade are unpredictable. In the distant past, Cuban sugar and Brazilian coffee were dumped into the ocean after the international market was blocked during the Great Depression. More recently, our silk exports have plummeted due to pressure from Japanese silk, and mulberry trees have been cut down for firewood. These are all cautionary tales. Therefore, we should grow more food for self-sufficiency and not dream of getting rich from the international commodification of agricultural products.</p>
<p>The current cotton problem is a problem of international commodification; and the reason why the current cotton problem is particularly serious is that, from a national defense perspective, we can no longer allocate excessive financial resources to cotton loans.</p>
<p>This year's cotton production is 19.6 million dan; if we buy it at an average price of 30 yuan per dan (some people have recently estimated the average price at 40 yuan per dan; however, the price of seed cotton in some areas has already plummeted to less than 10 yuan, so the price of ginned cotton will certainly not be so high), it will require nearly 600 million yuan in funding. Cotton production is almost entirely commodified. Which farmer grows cotton for their own consumption? Therefore, in adjusting cotton production, we must take full purchases as a prerequisite; that is why such large funds are needed. The food problem is different. The total value of food production is naturally much greater than that of cotton; however, the portion that is commodified is probably not as large as that of cotton. Therefore, from a national defense point of view, food is a more easily adjustable agricultural product.</p>
<p>Due to the outbreak of war, three-quarters of the yarn factories in the country have suspended operations; and due to the blockade of the coast, exports have become extremely difficult. Therefore, some people estimate that the sales volume for the next year, including the small amount of exports, will be at most 8 million dan. In that case, even if next year's production is halved, and the year after that is halved again, the accumulated cotton inventory will regularly exceed 10 million dan for three to four years. That is to say, most of the 600 million yuan collected for cotton purchases will turn into long-term bad debts. With the urgent military needs so great, where can we find such large idle funds to hoard such non-essential items?</p>
<p>China's cotton production originally relied on Japanese yarn factories for a small portion of domestic sales, and all exports relied on the Japanese market. To put it simply, the enemy can control our fate at any time. This agricultural policy of selling ourselves to the enemy is bound to run into obstacles during the war of resistance. Fortunately, the war of resistance was launched not too late, and fortunately, we have not ingested too much of this poison. Otherwise, if it had dragged on and production had doubled again, we would have truly been doomed!</p>
<p>We don't need to talk too much about the past; let's think about what to do in the future. From the direct perspective of national defense, we certainly cannot focus on adjusting the cotton market; however, for the sake of farmers' livelihoods, we cannot help but seriously consider this issue. We know that we should not use limited funds to hoard non-essential cotton during the war of resistance, but for the sake of cultivating popular support, we cannot stand idly by and watch the cotton farmers suffer. This is the most painful thing. According to the current situation, the future development will inevitably be that farmers suffer greatly and reluctantly sell their cotton, and the government will have to spend great effort and reluctantly provide relief. Currently, overseas cotton prices have plummeted, with the market price of Mumbai coarse cotton at only 20 yuan per dan in national currency; therefore, cotton growers cannot continue to dream about last year's market prices. In order to naturally reduce cotton production next year, the policy should probably make cotton growers worse off than grain growers; therefore, the predetermined price in the adjustment cannot be compared with last year's cotton price, but can only be compared with this year's grain price. If the income per mu for growing grain is 10 yuan, then growing cotton must be made less than 10 yuan.</p>
<p>The best way to collect and store cotton is to encourage farmers to voluntarily organize loan associations and directly apply for mortgages from financial institutions, so as to prevent intermediaries from manipulating the process. In addition to opening up the transfer mortgage portal and encouraging commercial banks and money shops to accept mortgages, national banks should also entrust these private financial institutions as agents to promote this. In addition to helping farmers organize loan associations, agricultural product adjustment agencies should also help them solve transportation and sales problems and general technical problems. When mortgaging, the price can be discounted by 30% based on the assumed price: the remaining 30% will be paid after the cotton is sold. I believe that the scope of mortgages should be broad, but the value of mortgages should not be high; the most important thing now is to give farmers some hope and some emergency funds. It is not necessary to give them a lot at once.</p>
<p>It is said that there may be great difficulties in the future in terms of packaging and storage. Cotton for export and long-term storage must be machine-pressed and packaged; otherwise, it will be inconvenient to load on ships for export, and storage will not only take up too much space, but will also be prone to fire. However, there is currently a shortage of materials needed for pressing and packaging, such as burlap bags and iron sheets; meeting the needs of cotton may hinder military needs. Similarly, due to military needs, we must hoard large quantities of grain and fodder, and we will need a large number of warehouses; however, storing large quantities of cotton will make it difficult to arrange warehouse capacity.</p>
<p>In short, everything, everything, we have received as a gift from economic cooperation between China and Japan! This agricultural policy of national subjugation has increased our serious internal contradictions; it makes it almost impossible for us to take care of the rural economy when we take care of national defense. However, this is still a fortunate event, we have not been subjugated as a result. While gritting our teeth and enduring this kind of pain, we must also know, and we must make the public know, that this part of the pain is caused by compromise policies. If we want to extricate ourselves from the slave economy and never suffer this kind of pain again, we can only eliminate all compromise theories and fight to the end to achieve final victory.</p>

<h3>Sanctions Against Aggressors</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>Our entire nation's sacred war to resist the brutal aggressors is clearly developing with a gradually favorable international situation.</p>
<p>On the 21st of last month, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov loudly appealed at the League of Nations General Assembly, demanding that world peace-loving countries implement collective sanctions against aggressor nations. On the 28th, 52 countries of the League of Nations unanimously resolved to condemn Japan's bombing of Chinese civilians. In addition to expressing support for this resolution, the U.S. State Department recently stated to the League of Nations, "The U.S. government firmly believes in the principle of cooperation among nations and is willing to find ways to promote the peaceful resolution of international conflicts. If the League of Nations provides the U.S. with concrete suggestions, the U.S. is extremely willing to give them careful consideration." From this, it can be seen that the U.S. attitude is still very active.</p>
<p>Now, all people around the world who cherish justice and peace are eagerly awaiting the implementation of effective measures to sanction aggressors. However, due to various international contradictions, there are still many obstacles ahead.</p>
<p>For example, the British Conservative government is, of course, extremely sympathetic to our country. However, it has many concerns and has not made a firm decision to effectively sanction Japan. This makes it very difficult to restrain the ambitions of the aggressors in the Far East.</p>
<p>Recently, the movement among the British public to boycott Japanese goods has been developing rapidly. This is somewhat beneficial to the overall situation in the Far East and is something we are deeply gratified by. We hope that this public opinion can prompt the British government to take firm and active steps for lasting peace in the Far East.</p>

<h3>I Submit Draft Resolution to League of Nations Requesting Confirmation of Japan as Aggressor Nation</h3>
<p>Based on Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, Advisory Committee Subcommittee Holds Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>[Geneva] Chinese representative Gu Weijun submitted a draft resolution to the 23-nation Advisory Committee of the League of Nations today, identifying Japan as an aggressor nation against a member of the League of Nations. This action is based on Article 10 of the Covenant. (1st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The subcommittee of the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue of the League of Nations General Assembly held a meeting today and initially exchanged views on the draft resolution proposed by Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun (which advocates recording and condemning Japan's aggression against Chinese territory). The subcommittee believes that it should first understand the situation in the Far East before continuing discussions. Therefore, it has requested the Secretariat of the League of Nations to prepare a document stating the facts of the conflict between China and Japan and listing the obligations that China or Japan should fulfill in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant and various international treaties, as a basis for discussion. The subcommittee then decided to reconvene tomorrow. (1st Central News Agency Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Geneva] It is reported that U.S. Representative to Geneva, Harrison, has received instructions from Secretary of State Hull that the U.S. will participate if the Advisory Committee makes a decision on the Far East issue. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] A Havas News Agency reporter has learned that China will request the League of Nations Advisory Committee tomorrow to record and condemn Japan's aggression against Chinese territory. Chinese Chief Representative Dr. Gu Weijun met with British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne today to explain China's position, namely: ① Although China believes that the Sino-Japanese dispute is a matter of general nature and is related to all member states of the League of Nations, China can accept it if the Advisory Committee assigns countries directly related to the Pacific issue to organize a subcommittee to handle it; ② If Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant is implemented now, that is, sanctions are imposed on Japan, it is originally a legitimate measure, but China can abandon this request; ③ The above two items are concessions made by China. China is now requesting the Advisory Committee to record and condemn Japan's acts of aggression before the Sino-Japanese dispute is transferred to the subcommittee for handling, as a condition of exchange. The Advisory Committee should also authorize the subcommittee to study methods of actively or passively assisting China. The so-called passive assistance means that the subcommittee should draw a conclusion from the Advisory Committee's condemnation of Japan, such as the Advisory Committee condemning the Japanese Air Force's bombing of Chinese cities without defensive works, and should prohibit the transportation of kerosene to Japan. This is not to implement sanctions, but to prevent the Japanese Air Force from obtaining kerosene supplies. Lord Cranborne replied that the representatives of most countries in the Advisory Committee may not accept China's proposal, but he can ask the British government for instructions. Dr. Gu Weijun said that China's attitude is very moderate, but if the Advisory Committee cannot satisfy China, its attitude may change. According to the Havas News Agency reporter, there may be a compromise solution to China's request. (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Moral Condemnation Ultimately Cannot Stop Enemy's Atrocities</h3>
<p>Japanese Spokesperson in Geneva Says Aerial Bombing Will Continue</p>

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Declares Opposition to International Mediation</h3>
<p>Military Actions Will Not Cease Until Established Policies Are Implemented</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At noon on the 1st, a spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry met with foreign reporters and read a lengthy statement opposing the international mediation proposal circulating in London, using unprecedentedly strong language. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The main points of the statement issued by the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesperson on the 1st are as follows: British representative Cranborne said that the Sino-Japanese dispute is of great concern to countries other than the two countries, which seems to imply that countries related to the Pacific issue need and want to convene a meeting. However, Japan believes that mediation is clearly unnecessary under the current circumstances. Before China changes its attitude and fundamentally abandons its anti-Japanese policy, Japan is determined to fight to the end and will resolutely move forward in accordance with its established policies. It is a pity that if the powers want to mediate, they must first fully understand Japan's purpose. If the powers want to convene an international committee or a Pacific conference to handle the Sino-Japanese dispute, it is not appropriate at least at this time. If they want to act jointly with China, they can do so at will, but they must first pay full attention to China's propaganda. If the so-called international committee or other conference, like the Twenty-Three Nation Committee, condemns the Japanese Air Force's resolution without understanding the truth, then all efforts to mediate will be in vain.

<h3>U.S. Expresses Dissatisfaction with Japan's Reply to U.S.</h3>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull stated today that the U.S. declaration that Japan must be held responsible for any losses the U.S. incurs in this Sino-Japanese war was not satisfactorily addressed in Japan's reply. However, he said that negotiations will continue in the future, even after the war ends. Hull referred to the conflict between China and Japan as a "war" for the first time today, but this was only a verbal statement and may not indicate any preconceived notions. Hull declined to criticize the Japanese reply to the U.S. protest against Japan's bombing of Chinese civilians, but said that everything would be clear by reading the contents of the two countries' notes. As for Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's suggestion that the U.S. and Japan "cooperate" to protect foreign nationals in China, he said that it was not convenient to discuss it because the meaning of the Japanese side was unclear.

<h3>British Political Circles Actively Advocate Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement</h3>
<p>Japan's Financial and Economic Foundation is Weak, British Newspapers Advocate Joint Action by Britain and the United States</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the boycott of Japanese goods movement, The Times commented, "This movement will have little effect unless it is supported by a large part of the British Empire and the United States." It is well known that Japan's economy is fragile. For example, British and American goods accounted for 65% of Japan's total imports in 1935, while Japanese goods exported to Britain and the United States accounted for more than 50% of the country's total exports. "After the boycott of Japanese goods is implemented, Japan's trade deficit will inevitably increase sharply, and as a result, the country's finances will inevitably fall into chaos, or even take the risk of resorting to retaliatory measures. This can be dealt with under the cooperation of Britain and the United States. In addition, if Japan's war against China is completely victorious, European and American countries will inevitably lose the Chinese market. Considering the two, it is better to boycott Japanese goods than to allow Japan to control China." (1st Central News Agency Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] British political figures, especially those on the left, are increasingly actively advocating a movement to economically pressure Japan, but British business circles may not support it. Leading members of the Federation of British Industries recently stated that the boycott movement is morally well-founded, but its implementation could endanger world peace. They also said that British interests in China have been severely damaged, and the Federation fears that British goods will not be able to recover their sales in China after they are lost. Therefore, they firmly believe that the British government must continue to make efforts to ensure that the Japanese authorities respect the interests of all countries and keep the war zone away from the Shanghai International Settlement. In addition, chambers of commerce throughout the UK have adopted an extremely reserved attitude, but have not considered boycotting Japanese goods. As for political groups, their attitudes are completely opposite.</p>
<p>British League of Nations Society Calls for Sanctions Against Aggressors</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the British League of Nations Society recently passed a resolution stating that Japan is now in China and clearly intends to use intimidation to complete its acts of aggression. The British government should request the League of Nations General Assembly to declare China an aggressed nation. All member states of the League of Nations should take various measures, such as refusing to import Japanese goods, to deprive the country of its ability to continue the war, but this should be conditional on countries outside the League of Nations doing the same. In addition, Britain should also suggest to the League of Nations General Assembly that all member states should immediately raise funds, at least 100,000 pounds, to cover the expenses of the League of Nations medical and relief team sent to China, and that the League of Nations General Assembly should continue to work and not adjourn before effective measures are taken.</p>
<p>London Free Churches Strongly Condemn Japanese Atrocities</p>
<p>A meeting was held today in the Whitechapel area of the London Free Churches to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue. A resolution was passed calling on the people of the country to boycott Japanese goods. After the meeting, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi first read a telegram from Ms. Song Meiling, the wife of Chairman Jiang, stating that Shanghai is running out of medical supplies to save wounded soldiers and civilians, and overseas aid is being hindered by the Japanese enemy. Please ask the British people to provide medical assistance. The crowd who attended the meeting, after hearing this, voluntarily donated generously, raising a total of 100 pounds on the spot. Then, an important resolution was passed, stating, "Japan launched an act of aggression against peace-loving China without provocation, and we hereby strongly condemn it. We also express our serious protest against Japan's slaughter of Chinese civilians and bombing of hospitals and fishing boats. We hereby express our solidarity with the Chinese people and admire their united and heroic spirit of resistance. All British men and women who uphold justice and oppose power should unanimously boycott Japanese goods and demand that the government not facilitate the Japanese government's purchase of military fire, gasoline, and other military supplies from Britain or its borrowing from the British market. The Parliament should also reconvene early to discuss this matter. The British representative to the League of Nations should also demand that the League of Nations General Assembly not adjourn before each member state fulfills its various obligations to China in accordance with the provisions of the Covenant. We firmly believe that the United States will be happy to participate in supporting China and serving China." (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Liverpool Communist Party Deeply Abhors Japan</p>
<p>Four representatives of the Liverpool Port Communist Party delivered a resolution to the Japanese Consulate in the area this afternoon, expressing their deep abhorrence of the Japanese aircraft's bombing of civilians in Guangzhou and other cities in China, and stating that the Communist Party has decided to urge dockworkers in Liverpool Port to refuse to load and unload Japanese goods. The Japanese Consul promised to forward the resolution to the Japanese government. (30th Central News Agency Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Attitude</h3>
<p>[Washington] Today, when a State Department official was asked about the U.S. attitude toward the British proposal to boycott Japanese goods, the official declined to comment or express their attitude, but said that the issue had not yet been raised by the U.S. side. Newspapers here have mostly denounced Japan's atrocities in bombing Chinese cities, but while they have all mentioned the boycott issue, they have not clearly stated whether the American people should participate. Six peace groups, including the National Council for the Prevention of War, have begun to discuss it and will soon make a joint statement. Some people believe that the boycott may hinder lasting peace and is not the original intention of the peace groups. Moreover, boycott movements have always made the public tend towards nationalism. However, the groups also do not want to risk being suspected of sympathizing with Japan's bombing of civilians, and the fact that the proponents in the UK are educational leaders may also influence the attitude of the groups.

<h3>Japanese Trade Deficit</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] During the nine months of this year, Japanese trade statistics showed a trade deficit in all but the last ten days of August and the middle and last ten days of September. Exports totaled 1,460,769,000 yuan, and imports totaled 3,204,898,000 yuan, resulting in a trade deficit of 744,129,000 yuan. Compared with last year, imports increased by 1,009,214,000 yuan, and exports also increased by 475,465,000 yuan. However, the most important reason for the increase in exports was price increases. For example, the total volume of cotton cloth exports this year was 1,909,144,000 square yards, a decrease of 84,731,000 square yards compared with last year, but the amount increased by 78,900,000 yuan, which is one example. There are also cases where both quantity and amount increased. From the perspective of export regions, exports to India, Egypt, and Australia decreased, while exports to North, South, and Central China all increased. In addition, six types of imports, including cotton, wool, oil, iron, and machinery, accounted for one-third of the increase of more than 1,009 million yuan. Observing the trade situation in the next three months, some say that a trade surplus is expected to continue because there is no need to import cotton, etc. Others say that the future is still difficult to predict, and the key lies in the import volume of crude oil, gasoline, iron, and machinery. Also, in mid-September, among the 45 major wholesale commodities in Tokyo, 16 increased in price compared with August, 14 remained unchanged, and 15 decreased. Timber, miscellaneous grains, and oils all increased. Metals remained unchanged, but copper and lead generally declined. Overall, the prices of goods related to military transportation declined, while the prices of peaceful goods tended to increase. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Rome] Prime Minister Mussolini returned from Germany last night with great pomp, like a Roman emperor's triumph in ancient times.

<h3>American Aviation Personnel in China Bitterly Criticize American Cowardly Policy</h3>
<p>Gather in Capital to Draft Open Letter to Washington, Saying U.S. Government Should Not Ignore Nine-Power Treaty</p>
<p>The English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" reports that the American Aviation Advisory Committee in China gathered a day or two ago at the Capital Hotel in Nanjing to draft an open letter to the White House in Washington, bitterly criticizing the U.S. government's vacillating policy towards the Sino-Japanese war. It said that the U.S. government should not cowardly deny all the rights that the U.S. should have under the Nine-Power Treaty and sacrifice freedom of the seas in the Far East. As for the Japanese government's implementation of aircraft bombing, making only perfunctory protests is enough to show its weakness. It also asked the U.S. government to pay attention to the fact that the Japanese are illegal elements among nations. Japan is now destroying international law on land and sea, but what the Committee pointed out was not only the United States, but also other powers, because they obeyed Japan's orders and never protested, but they did not do as the U.S. Ambassador did, moving the embassy in response to Japan's request and declaring that Japan would be responsible for any losses suffered by their expatriates, which was still somewhat satisfactory. The letter called Japan a warlike and barbaric country with the ambition to conquer the world, and that it is now urgent to stop it with great force. Otherwise, it will first conquer China and then use China's rich manpower and raw materials to achieve its ambition to conquer the world. China is the key to future peace in the world. The letter frankly criticized all the actions of the U.S. government regarding the current Sino-Japanese war and attacked those in the United States who advocate neutrality for willingly abandoning the principles for which their ancestors fought. It concluded by saying that the experts are employed during peacetime and will remain in their positions until the last person during the war, and praised Chairman Jiang in conclusion. The wording of the letter is stern and without any reservations, showing the true colors of a soldier, and its sincerity in caring for China's happiness overflows in its words. It is not known what impression the U.S. government will have when it receives it.</p>
<h3>Our Lone Soldier Deploys Misleading Tactics to Scare Away Enemy Troops</h3>
<p>Three Soldiers Repel Dozens of Enemy Troops, British Soldiers Witness and Praise Unreservedly</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a foreign soldier stationed in the Henan Road area told reporters about an interesting battle he witnessed yesterday. He said that the Baoshan Road area had been quiet for the past few days. Behind a certain defensive work, two Chinese soldiers were seen stationed every day. Behind the nearby Japanese defensive works, one Japanese soldier was also stationed, facing each other from afar and not interfering with each other. However, on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, more than a hundred Japanese soldiers suddenly rushed out of their defensive position. He was quite worried about these three Chinese soldiers. What was even more worrying was that two of them suddenly handed their steel helmets to another Chinese soldier and fled with a heavy machine gun. At this point, only one lone Chinese soldier exposed his steel helmet outside the defensive work. He used both hands to move the steel helmet given to him by his companions to create a misleading tactic. At this time, the advancing Japanese soldiers saw the steel helmet trembling on the Chinese military defensive works, knew that they were on guard, and crawled forward. Suddenly, a machine gun fired loudly, because the two Chinese soldiers who had fled earlier had circled to the side of the Japanese soldiers and opened fire. At the same time, the lone Chinese soldier also threw the steel helmet given to him by his companions and opened fire with a machine gun. In a hurry, the Japanese soldiers did not know where the Chinese soldiers came from. He witnessed dozens of Japanese soldiers being killed on the spot, and the rest fled in panic. He admired the Chinese army's vigilance and bravery and said that the Chinese army was usually very humble and friendly. He and his companions often exchanged beer for yellow wine and sorghum with the Chinese soldiers.</p>

<h3>The Tzu Lien Hui Appeals Again for Donations of Clothing and Bedding</h3>
<p>So That the Disaster Victims May Avoid Cold and Hunger, and the Country Can Preserve Its Strength</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Committee, Relief of War Zone Civilian Committee, believes that in the blink of an eye, the White Dew season is here, and the cool winds are blowing. One cannot feel warm without a lined jacket in the morning and evening, and one will surely feel cold without a cotton quilt at midnight. Recently, most of the displaced people in the various shelters have contracted colds. The committee, holding the sacred aspiration of "saving people thoroughly," has instructed inspection specialists to go to the various shelters to investigate the actual situation, so as to devise ways to provide relief at any time. However, because there are few clothes and many people, the burden is too great, and there is only a sigh of "effort falling short of desire." Now, the committee is once again appealing for the lives of the displaced people, imploring people from all walks of life across the country to embrace the spirit of "treating others' hunger and drowning as their own," and to have the desire to "establish oneself and help others establish themselves," to generously donate clothing and bedding, or donate medicines, so that all can be united and jointly support good deeds. Directly enabling these 40,000 displaced people to avoid cold and hunger, and indirectly preparing the country to have the strength to deal with the brutal enemy for a long time. Saving the country and saving the people, the merit will be immeasurable. If you are willing to help, please go to the accounting department of the committee at Renji Hall on Sixth Malu. Receipts will be issued immediately and thanks will be published in the newspaper to promote benevolence.</p>

<h3>A Major Fire Occurs in Bailianjing</h3>
<p>Carelessness Also in Nanshi Youche Street</p>
<p>A fire suddenly broke out in the thatched huts around the Zhongxing East Stack Coal Industry Public Stack in Bailianjing, Pudong, at about 9:00 PM yesterday. At this time, there were only two workers residing in the two stacks, so after the fire broke out, it was felt that there was no way to rescue it. For a time, the fire spread very fiercely, destroying more than 30 thatched huts, containing about 3,000 bamboo baskets. The cause of the fire is unknown. At the same time, the Qian Fusheng family in Youche Street, Nanshi, was also careless, but the fire was quickly extinguished.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Establishes a Special Department to Identify the Fineness of Gold and Silver</h3>
<p>Rumors of Underestimation Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>The Central Bank of this city, in view of the increasing number of people using gold and silver items to purchase national salvation bonds or donate to the government, and the government's announcement to various banks to add 6% to the assessed value and issue national salvation bond receipts to encourage this, will inevitably lead to a surge of people freely donating gold and silver ornaments in the future. In order to expedite matters and facilitate the public, the bank has consulted with the local gold industry and jeweler industry guilds to select a number of personnel proficient in identifying the fineness of gold and silver every day, and has established a special department to be responsible for handling this matter, so as to meet the people's expectations. A public announcement was made yesterday to begin implementation, and it is hoped that other entrusted banks can also follow suit.</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Expresses His Loyalty</h3>
<p>Determined Not to Fall for Enemy Tricks</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng, President of the Shanghai Local Association, received a telegram from Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, yesterday, stating: "Mr. Du Yuesheng, and to Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Huang Renzhi, and all gentlemen, I have read your cordial telegram and am deeply grateful for your concern. The Japanese side's attempt to manipulate the puppet organizations in North China is purely a divisive tactic. Their intention has been long in the making. They are willing to fabricate slanderous statements, sow discord, and confuse the public. Although I am foolish, I will never fall for their tricks. Gentlemen are clear-sighted and can distinguish between truth and falsehood, so as not to allow baseless words to shake public opinion. I am conveying my heartfelt feelings and hope for your understanding. Han Fuqu bows to the east."</p>
<p>Chairman Han telegraphed the Shanghai Educational Circles Wartime Service Corps on the 30th, saying: "I have received your cordial telegram with respect. The soldiers in Songhu are standing up to annihilate the enemy, and their hard work is commendable. The comrades at home, upon hearing the news, are inspired to emulate them. I, in my humble position as a regional official, dare not lag behind in resisting the enemy and saving the country. I vow to exhaust my humble sincerity to jointly relieve the national crisis. I respectfully send this telegram in reply, and hope for your understanding. Han Fuqu bows on the 30th, confidential."</p>
<h3>The Enemy Brazenly Disregards Everything and Establishes Customs in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Seizing the Site of the Lanlu Customs Bureau; Destroying Our Nation's Customs Sovereignty</p>
<p>The enemy military authorities have recently established customs in the Yangshupu war zone, and it has now been officially established on Lanlu, which is an extreme act of destroying our national sovereignty. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Officially Open for Business</p>
<p>The Jianghai Customs has a branch on Lanlu in Yangshupu, with more than a dozen Chinese and Western customs officers responsible for verifying customs documents and collecting taxes. After the Shanghai war, due to its location in the war zone, the work could not be carried out, and the Chinese and Western customs officers withdrew one after another. Later, it was occupied by the enemy army, who prepared to establish customs, and officially started operations on October 1st (i.e., yesterday). Enemy ships and goods arriving in Shanghai are directed to go there for verification, declaration, and tax payment. However, with the exception of the Japanese, foreign merchants from other countries refuse to go there and still go to the Jianghai Customs to pay taxes.</p>
<p>Customs Attitude</p>
<p>A reporter from the Shun Pao recently visited Mr. Qiu Zhuoqi, Deputy Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs, to inquire about the attitude of the customs. According to him, the customs had received reports and was paying close attention to the development, but because the Japanese side had not made any formal representations, it had not yet contacted them. According to his personal observations, there are currently very few Japanese goods being imported, which has little economic impact on us, but our country cannot allow other countries to establish customs within our borders, so we must strive for it on the basis of sovereignty.</p>

<h3>Enemy Suffers a Miserable Defeat in Gujiazai; Fierce Street Fights Occurred in Zhabei Last Night</h3>
<p>More Than 200 Enemies Killed in Our Army's Encirclement and Pincer Attack; Our Army Holds Absolute Advantage in Luodian and Liuhang; Enemy Troops Retreat from Jiangwan to the City Center; Our Side Dispatches Elite Troops to Search for Traces of the Enemy</p>
<p>The front-line battle report received by this newspaper this morning is as follows: A. Shanghai Area: (1) The enemy near Jinjiagang, Youshagang, Dijiabang, and Wujiazai, southeast of Jiangwan, had completely withdrawn by 5:00 PM on the 30th (the previous day). (2) The enemy from Tanjiabing to the corner of Shuidedian Road and Xijiatang and Zhangjiaxiang has also withdrawn. A certain unit of our army has advanced to that area. (3) Yesterday morning (the 1st), the enemy shelled the vicinity of Baziqiao very fiercely. After our artillery force fiercely returned fire, the enemy army immediately became silent. B. Liuhang Area: (1) Yesterday morning, the enemy's artillery fire was very fierce on the line of Gujiazai, Mengwan, and Zhangzhai. At the same time, multiple aircraft carried out bombing, and then more than ten tanks and more than a thousand infantry attacked and advanced on our positions. Our army calmly fought back, and it was not until 3:00 PM that they were suddenly and painfully attacked by us, and the enemy collapsed in a panic. It is estimated that more than 500 enemies were killed in this battle, including 5 officers, and a light machine gun and more than ten rifles were seized. In addition, the enemy lost many guns in front of our positions and are currently trying to collect them. (2) At around 7:00 PM the night before last, in front of the positions of our division north of Taipingqiao, the enemy suddenly used more than ten tanks to cover its infantry and launched a fierce attack. At that time, one part of our army's position was broken through by the enemy, but after our army bravely counterattacked and relentlessly bombarded the enemy tanks with mortars, the enemy was unable to withstand it and collapsed. Our army immediately restored the original position. C. Luodian Area: (1) Our army's positions near Yanzhai were constantly attacked by the enemy's artillery, and the situation was extremely fierce. At the same time, more than ten tanks were used to cover the infantry's attack on us. After our army fought fiercely with blood, the enemy was unable to withstand it and was defeated. (2) The enemy who attacked our Shixianggong Temple yesterday morning was bravely repelled by our division and entrenched in the Changqiao area, and did not dare to attack again.</p>
<p>The latest front-line battle report is compiled and recorded as follows: (1) The battle situation has been quiet in recent days, with occasional minor skirmishes. (2) Before dusk on the evening of the 30th, more than ten enemy tanks stopped in front of the Taipingqiao (north of Liuhang Town) position of our division. An order was given for our division to fire more than a hundred shells, and the enemy returned fire with more than five hundred shells. The Taipingqiao position was simultaneously invaded by the enemy. A part of the regiment of our brigade was dispatched to assist in defeating the enemy and restoring the original position. (3) At 9:00 PM on the evening of the 30th, the Wanfuqiao position of the division was broken through by the enemy. A part of the brigade was dispatched to provide assistance and recover Wanfuqiao.</p>
<p>At dusk the night before last (the 30th), the positions of our troops north of Taipingqiao were once fiercely attacked by the enemy, who used more than ten tanks as a vanguard to charge our positions, and their rear artillery also concentrated firepower to bombard the area. At that time, our troops immediately rose up to counterattack, and our artillery also returned fire fiercely on the enemy's positions. After a standoff of about two hours, the enemy fired no less than five hundred shells, and their reinforcements continued to arrive, causing a small part of our position to be broken through at the time. However, our main force arrived like a tide soon after and immediately launched a counterattack, jointly attacking the enemy with the original defending troops, and the enemy was unable to withstand it and collapsed. Our army immediately recovered the original position.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Concentrate South of the Yunzaobang</h3>
<p>Large numbers of enemy troops are gathering in the area of Zhangjiazai and Luqiaozhai on the border of the Jiangwan District, south of the Yunzaobang, but there has been no action so far.</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery in Yangshupu Bombards the North Station</h3>
<p>Inaccurate Target, We Suffer No Losses</p>
<p>Since the start of the Shanghai war, the enemy army has bombed with airplanes and artillery every day. Up to the 2nd, it has been 50 days. Not only has it not made any progress, but it has also suffered heavy casualties. Therefore, since yesterday, it has suddenly changed its battle strategy and withdrawn some of the enemy troops stationed along North Sichuan Road. Our army then advanced to the junction of the railway and North Sichuan Road, but soon returned to its original defense. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, enemy planes and artillery heavily bombarded the section from the end of North Sichuan Road to the Laobazi Road intersection, suspecting that our front-line troops had already passed North Sichuan Road. As of this afternoon, the enemy army marines and naval warships in Yangshupu are still bombarding continuously, approximately every two or three minutes, and most of the shells seem to be aimed at our North Railway Station. However, many of our civilian houses have been destroyed, and our newly built North Railway Station is still standing still. The artillery fire we returned is falling on important areas such as the Japanese Naval Training Ground and the Marine Corps Headquarters.</p>
<h3>We Dispatch Elite Troops in Two Routes to Search for Traces of the Enemy</h3>
<p>Deploying Alert Positions Along the Way in Order to Encircle the City Center</p>
<p>After the enemy west of the city center moved east, our army has now dispatched elite troops to search forward from Sanmin Road and Xiangyin Road, deploying alert positions along the way in order to encircle the city center. Another part is advancing from Hejiaxiang through the Sijing Stadium to attack the enemy. As of 11:00 AM, no traces of the enemy had been seen, so no contact had been made.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, a reporter accompanying the army reported at 10:00 AM on the 2nd that after the enemy troops entrenched in the area west of Songhu Road and Huangxing Road in Jiangwan, in the city center, began to retreat eastward, our army dispatched elite troops to search forward. As a result, it was learned that there were no traces of the enemy in the following locations: (1) The area of Tianlusi north of Sanmin Road. (2) The area of Zhangjiaxiang, Xitangwan, Jinjiaxiang, and Qiujiazhai, southeast of Fudan University. The enemy retreated 1,000 meters. (3) The enemy east of Qimei Road and west of Yinjiazai and Wujiazai has completely withdrawn. (4) The enemy south of Xiangyin Road and near the East-West Sports Association Road has also retreated southward and concentrated on Jiangwan Road. (5) This morning, the enemy transported a large number of landmines to the city center, presumably to bury them there to prevent our advance.</p>
<h3>Fierce Street Fights Occurred in Zhabei Last Night When the Enemy Attacked</h3>
<p>Enemy Uses Tanks to Cover Infantry Assault; Our Army Divides and Envelops, Annihilating More Than 200 Enemies; Killing Four Enemy Company and Platoon Leaders</p>
<p>From last night until this morning (the 2nd), fierce fighting occurred in Zhabei. At around 9:00 PM last night, enemy tanks covered infantry and probed westward from North Sichuan Road, harassing our positions in the area of Shiqing Road, Dongbaoxing Road, Qiujiang Road, and Zhongzhou Road. The number of people was about one regiment, swarming in, especially in the Baoxing Road and Qiujiang Road areas. Our army also attacked the enemy's tanks with mechanized units and covered the infantry to meet them. The fierce fighting was extremely intense. Our army bravely charged in and fought hand-to-hand for several hours, cutting off the enemy's communication, heavily surrounding them, and annihilating them. In this battle, the enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties. More than 120 enemies were killed in the Baoxing Road area, more than 90 enemies were killed in the Qiujiang Road area, and the enemy suffered casualties of one or twenty people in other areas. One enemy company leader and three platoon leaders were also killed. Our army took advantage of the victory to pursue the fleeing enemy and rushed directly to the vicinity of the Yongfeng Building on North Sichuan Road. On the Zhongzhou Road side, a White Russian spy was captured and is currently being detained for interrogation.</p>
<p>At around 9:00 PM last night, while the enemy army's artillery positions in the city center were fiercely bombarding Zhabei, one enemy regiment and more than ten tanks advanced from North Sichuan Road towards Shiqing Road, Qiujiang Road, Baoxing Road, and Dongbaoxing Road in Zhabei. At that time, our army immediately shot grenades and mortars at the enemy vehicles. Seeing that they could not attack, the enemy advanced stealthily along the above-mentioned roads in a skirmish line. Our army's vanguard troops also jumped out of the trenches and pounced on them, launching fierce street fights. After about an hour, the enemy's tanks and infantry had been cut into two pieces by our army. After being severely attacked separately, the enemy troops collapsed in a panic. But they came again not long after. Our army was a hundred times more courageous and dealt a heavy blow to them. The enemy troops then changed their plan and concentrated their forces to attack Qiujiang Road and Baoxing Road. Their rear artillery positions also began to bombard fiercely, hoping to break our positions. However, our army remained calm and concentrated its firepower, using flesh and blood to fight the enemy with bayonets. Seeing that the enemy army could not hold on, reinforcements were frequently added, so the fierce battle was unprecedented. It continued until about 7:00 AM this morning, when the enemy finally collapsed and retreated due to excessive casualties. The enemy corpses were everywhere, reaching more than two hundred, and it was discovered that one platoon leader had also been killed by our army. As of noon today, the enemy army still did not dare to collect the dead bodies.</p>
<h3>Enemy Army Holds Meeting This Morning</h3>
<p>To Discuss the Final Disposal Methods for the Shanghai War; Songjing Telegrams Tokyo for Instructions After the Meeting</p>
<p>According to Ta Kung Pao, it is confirmed that starting at 7:00 AM today, the highest military commander of the enemy army held a military meeting at the Japanese Consulate on Waibaidu Bridge. For a time, there were as many as twenty or thirty black-license cars parked near the consulate. It is estimated that at least twenty people participated. At the same time, two speedboats shuttled back and forth between the "Izumo" warship and the Japanese Consulate, transporting officials. The meeting had not adjourned until about 11:00 AM. According to news released by the Japanese side, the meeting held by the enemy this morning was to discuss the steps for the final battle in Shanghai in the future, so it was very important in nature. Commander Hasegawa of the Third Fleet, Captain Iwamura of the Izumo, Commander of the Army and Air Force Matsui, Naval Attaché Takeda, and Chief of Staff Oda Yayumi all personally attended and participated in the discussion. It is also learned that after this meeting, Matsui and Hasegawa will sign a telegram to the two provinces of the country for instructions, and then proceed with everything. Therefore, there will be major new developments in the Shanghai war in the next day or two.</p>
<h3>Pudong Undergoes Enemy Bombing Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, enemy planes wantonly bombed the area of Lanni Du and Yangjia Du in Pudong, dropping a total of three bombs, which made a huge sound. A survey this morning showed that only a few civilian houses were destroyed and a few people were slightly injured. At 7:00 AM this morning, three enemy planes appeared again over Pudong and Nanshi, strafing pedestrians with machine guns in the non-combat area of Nanshi Huangpu Tangqiao and Gaochang Temple. At about 9:00 AM, enemy planes flew out again and wreaked havoc, dropping bombs in the area behind Lujiazui.</p>
<p>At around 8:30 AM this morning, two more enemy planes flew from the northeast towards the sky over Pudong. After circling for several weeks, they dropped several bombs in Kongjiazai Qiaotiannei, west of Qinci Yangdian, with two bombs exploding, injuring two farmers, Shi Aliang and the boy Kong Yinji. There were no other losses. The enemy planes flew south.</p>
<p>Last night, our air force launched a night attack on the enemy's positions. The enemy warships were extremely fearful and indiscriminately fired anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, shooting into the skies over Nanshi and Pudong, causing stray bullets to fly everywhere. In Nanshi, the power lines on Youche Street were cut, and the stray electricity burned down the doorplate at No. 38. It also struck two holes in the Tingzi Room at No. 9 Hongxiang Lane on Guohuo Road, but no one was injured. Many civilian houses on the Limaru Road in the 16th Puli were pierced with small holes. In Tangqiao Town, Pudong, the tiles of as many as five houses were hit. In Bailianjing, the thatched shacks of poor people caught fire after being hit by bombs, burning down more than twenty shacks.</p>
<h3>Enemy Reinforcements Arrive with Another Division</h3>
<p>2,000 Cavalry Arrive First Yesterday; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Also Transported</p>
<p>The enemy's fourth reinforcement, one division and one brigade, totaling approximately 40,000 people, has been arriving in Shanghai in succession over the past ten days. The enemy army began its fourth general offensive on the 28th of last month. However, because our side's positions are solid and morale is high, the enemy army has been heavily attacked by our army since the enemy's attack, and the enemy army's casualties have suddenly increased. Now, in order to achieve the goal of a quick victory, the enemy has decided to send another elite division to Shanghai. The first batch of them, cavalry, approximately 2,000 people, were transported to Shanghai at dawn today by four enemy merchant ships converted into transports, No. 158 Yugimaru, No. 260 Pacific Maru, No. 324 Kinryu Maru, and No. 282 Meiko Maru, and landed at the Huangpu, Osaka, and Huishan wharves. At the same time, large numbers of warhorses were also unloaded.</p>
<p>Also today (the 2nd) in the morning, two more enemy merchant ships converted into transports, No. 91 Haguro Maru and the enemy ship Nagasaki Maru, sailed to Shanghai and docked at the Huishan wharf. Large numbers of enemy military vehicles, tanks, and more than a thousand boxes of ammunition were unloaded and landed.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee Group Discusses Our Resolution</h3>
<p>British Representative Favors Weakening the Wording, Our Delegation Extremely Disappointed</p>
<p>[Geneva] The subgroup of the League of Nations Advisory Committee met this afternoon to discuss the resolution proposed by the Chinese delegation (i.e., Zhang Sheng's proposal to record and condemn Japan's invasion of China). It was decided that further data collection was necessary, and the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, was requested to draft a document providing a general explanation of the recent events in the Far East and the obligations of China and Japan under the League of Nations Covenant and existing treaties. The subgroup then adjourned and will continue tomorrow. Chinese representatives are extremely disappointed and pessimistic about this matter. A spokesman for the delegation told a Havas reporter, "We originally hoped that the draft resolution would be passed smoothly immediately. However, the subgroup used the excuse of collecting unnecessary information to postpone the meeting for 24 hours. Furthermore, certain parties, including the British delegation, want to weaken the wording of the draft resolution and delete the section specifying Japan's invasion of China, which is very disappointing. We have already given up the right to demand sanctions against Japan and have been as moderate as possible. Now we will never concede any further. Although the subgroup's work is kept secret, we will still make the countries participating in the committee bear their responsibilities. Which country dares to condemn Japan's aggression, and which country turns a blind eye and refuses to condemn it, will eventually be known to the outside world." Regarding this statement by the Chinese delegation, the British delegation was quite surprised and said: ① The purpose of the subgroup committee's request for supplementary information from the League of Nations Secretariat is to ensure that the final ruling is based on reliable and irrefutable evidence. ② The wording of the resolution condemning Japan is very firm. ③ The word "aggression" may be included in the resolution. ④ Even if this word is deleted, it is for China's benefit, in order to avoid the United States implementing the Neutrality Act.

<h3>League of Nations to Fund China's Epidemic Prevention Efforts</h3>
<p>Report of the Technical Cooperation Committee for China Passed by the Executive Yuan Meeting</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations Executive Yuan held a closed-door meeting this afternoon, chaired by the French representative, Paul-Boncour. The report submitted by the Technical Cooperation Committee for China was unanimously passed. Its content advocated two points: ① Immediately use all funds of the League of Nations to assist China's epidemic prevention efforts. ② These funds are currently only a drop in the bucket, and therefore it is proposed to request the next League of Nations General Assembly to increase the amount of the special fund for technical cooperation with China in the next year's regulations. Although this report was unanimously passed by all the member states of the Executive Yuan, the Chinese delegation did not feel completely satisfied. China requested two things: (A) The League of Nations' medical assistance to China should not be limited to rescuing those suffering from epidemics, but should also rescue soldiers and civilians injured in the war. (B) Countries most closely related to China must find ways to urge the League of Nations to increase the amount of the special fund for technical cooperation with China, especially the funding for medical assistance. China originally hoped that the League of Nations could provide more than 5 million Swiss francs in funding to assist China's medical rescue efforts. However, according to the report submitted by the Technical Cooperation Committee, the funds that the League of Nations can use are less than 300,000 Swiss francs, which is a very large difference.

<h3>French Officials Deny Sino-French Non-Aggression Pact</h3>
<p>Refuting Japanese Rumors</p>
<p>[Paris] A Japanese newspaper published a message stating that the Chinese and French governments have begun negotiating a mutual non-aggression treaty and have reached a preliminary agreement in principle. This news has been firmly denied by official sources. (Central News Agency, 1st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>US Consul in Hankou Cables Shirley Temple</h3>
<p>Urging Her to Comfort Chinese Children and Immediately Raise Funds for Relief</p>
<p>[Hankou] After the enemy planes attacked Wuhan, foreign residents in Hankou witnessed the inhumane atrocities of the Japanese and rose up to appeal and provide material assistance. In addition to cabling his government, the US Consul in Hankou recently cabled the American child star Shirley Temple, saying, "You and your little friends are very happy there. You should know that many children in China are being bombed by Japanese planes, causing broken limbs or becoming homeless orphans. This is so painful and so pitiful. We hope and request that you first send a telegram to comfort them, and then ask your big friends, powerful and rich people, to raise funds to send to relieve them. This is a great charitable act, and we hope you will work hard to do it." The foreign friend's sentiments are deeply touching. (Central News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Trivial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Aspect</p>
<p>Enemy troops in the downtown area of Yunzaobang suddenly withdrew yesterday. The intention is unclear, which is strange. In my opinion, there are no more than three points. ① Our army's defense line is solid. The enemy cannot break through and plans to use a strategy of luring the enemy deep, allowing our army to penetrate deep and then attack from three sides, or bury dangerous objects such as landmines to inflict heavy losses on our army. ② The enemy army of 150,000 to 160,000 has been stalemated for fifty to sixty days with no progress. They cannot avoid being disheartened. In North China, our army is shortening the front lines on the Pinghan and Jinpu lines and in various parts of northern Shanxi due to personnel and certain relationships. Therefore, the enemy's front line is extended, and our elite troops are gradually moving north. The enemy feels a sense of emptiness in their defense. Rather than "a large army of 100,000 troops besieging a strong city," it is better to transfer a portion of them to reinforce North China. If North China is lost, the enemy's entire effort will be in vain. ③ According to news from a certain embassy in Beijing, the German and Italian leaders decided during their meeting to advise Japan to quickly find a way to stop the invasion of China to avoid excessive consumption of strength, which would affect future joint actions. The implication is clear. The enemy may also be considering this. Apart from these three points, there are no other amazing strategies.</p>

<h3>Tragic Scene of Enemy Planes Bombing Wuhan</h3>
<p>Hanyang Suffers the Most Damage, Hundreds Killed and Injured</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: At 4:20 PM on September 24th, the Wuhan Air Defense Command received a report that 13 enemy planes were attacking Wuhan from Jiujiang. An air raid alarm was immediately issued to alert the citizens, and a large air force unit was sent to intercept them. A fierce air battle occurred at Gedian (Echeng County). One enemy plane was damaged and crashed. Seven enemy planes still advanced towards Wuhan, invading Wuhan's airspace at an altitude of 3,000 feet at 4:50 PM. At that time, high-angle guns and cannons from the ground and naval warships fired into the sky. Another team of the air force also intercepted them in the air. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy planes panicked and dropped more than a dozen bombs along both banks of the Xiang River and strafed densely populated areas with machine guns. At 5:20 PM, they fled eastward.</p>
<p>The enemy planes' bombing targets seemed to be the airfield and the Hanyang Arsenal, but because of our strict defenses, the enemy planes could not achieve their goals, so they turned to densely populated areas to drop bombs. In Hankou, one bomb hit Fuyuan Teahouse on Hanzheng Street, and one bomb each hit Quanlong Lane and Zhupai Lane, all of which exploded immediately. One bomb fell into the Yangtze River at Ning Shao Wharf but did not explode. In Wuchang, one bomb hit the playground of Wenxue Middle School. In Hanyang, the enemy planes dropped a total of five or six bombs, falling on Shantou, Shuangjie, Wuzili, Xinrenli, Tanjialou, and other places. Among them, Hanyang suffered the most damage. Two bombs hit Wuzili, destroying nine-tenths of the houses in the entire neighborhood, killing and injuring more than 200 residents. A nearby vegetable market was completely destroyed. In Hankou's Hanzheng Street and Quanlong Lane, a total of 30 to 40 houses were destroyed, and about 200 people were killed and injured. Wuchang suffered the least damage, with only Cheng Chao, a student at Wenxue Middle School, and a child in Kuaizi Street killed by bombs. In addition, many boatmen in the Xiang River were also killed. In total, in this 40-minute air raid, about 300 civilian houses were destroyed and about 500 people were killed and injured in the three towns of Wuhan.</p>
<p>After the enemy planes left, reporters inspected the bombed areas. Pedestrians were prohibited on the streets. After explaining their purpose to the police chief, they were led to Hanzheng Street. Fuyuan Teahouse and the houses to its left and right had become a pile of rubble. It was said that a fire had broken out after the bombs hit, but fortunately, the fire brigade rushed to the scene and quickly extinguished it. Smoke was still rising from the rubble, and many people were buried in it. The rescue team was prying and rescuing them. Some of the injured people who had been rescued were covered in blood, some had broken heads, some had intestines flowing out of their abdomen, and some had broken arms and legs. The sounds of moaning in pain and the cries of women and children were mixed together, which was truly unbearable to witness. The rescue team members were busy bandaging their wounds. After bandaging, they were sent to the hospital in batches. The bombed area in Quanlong Lane and Zhupai Lane was even larger, with 20 to 30 houses collapsed and a fire also breaking out. This is a gathering place for the poor, and the casualties were relatively high. Stretcher teams were coming and going and were relatively busy. These many injured poor people were sent to the Municipal Hospital, Puai Hospital, Red Cross Society, and Red Swastika Society for accommodation. An investigation of various hospitals revealed that more than 100 lightly injured people had been discharged from the Municipal Hospital, and about 100 seriously injured people were hospitalized. There were also more than 100 people in Puai Hospital. More than 1,000 refugees who were not injured but were homeless were temporarily sent to Jiulian Nunnery and Yuanzhao Temple for accommodation.</p>
<h3>Xiamen, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou Hinterlands Are All Peaceful</h3>
<p>American Overseas Chinese Are Unwilling to Leave Xiamen, British Overseas Chinese Are Determined Not to Evacuate, Food in Southern Fujian Is Not a Concern</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: Amidst the enemy ships' blockade and harassment of the coastal areas of Southern Fujian, the rear area management and its organization in Xiamen City have been completed. The important points are: ① The Food Department of the Anti-Enemy Association has implemented control over the city's food supply. All transportation, storage, and food prices are managed. The department also ordered each household in Xiamen to store three months' worth of rice. The procurement and distribution of grain merchants are coordinated by the department. Currently, rice prices are as stable as ever. However, the price of flour has risen sharply because Shanghai-Hong Kong national flour and imported flour are out of stock. ② Xiamen has not held air defense drills in the past due to environmental reasons. After the national army was stationed, only one simple lighting and traffic control was held at the end of August. Now the Xiamen Garrison Command has established the 'Xiamen City Air Defense Committee', which is actively handling fire prevention, rescue, and other matters. The organization has been completed, and 120 temporary shelters have been set up throughout the city. A large-scale exercise will be held soon. ③ 1,000 to 2,000 Taiwanese are hiding in Xiamen and Gulangyu. About 1,000 of them remain in Xiamen, some unwilling to return, and some deliberately staying as spies. The municipal government specially issued a bulletin on the 13th: 'Recently, there are about 1,000 Taiwanese in Xiamen, with varying qualities. They are limited to registering at their respective police stations within five days, from the 13th to the 17th. Those who fail to register after the deadline will be investigated and dealt with according to military law. Chinese merchants who falsely claim Taiwanese status are limited to registering with their respective police stations within ten days, from the 15th to the 22nd, and submit a letter of repentance to the Chamber of Commerce, which will certify it and submit it to the municipal government for record. Those who fail to do so will be treated as an exception.' As for the municipal government's major measures for Taiwan, (A) Those who have lived in Xiamen for a long time, are legitimate merchants, have a concept of the motherland, and are unwilling to return to Taiwan can be allowed to apply to renounce their nationality and restore their Chinese nationality. However, they should register their property in Xiamen with the government, pay taxes, and make up for the taxes they have owed in the past. (B) Those vagrants who have been used by the enemy in the past can be treated equally and reformed if they can rehabilitate themselves. Chinese merchants who falsely claim Taiwanese status, repent and reform, abide by national laws in the future, and voluntarily donate a certain amount of patriotic funds will also be allowed to be recorded. ④ The citizens of Xiamen who migrated until September 8th and 9th have gradually settled down. It is estimated that there are still more than 110,000 people remaining. Household registration inspections and Baojia reorganization have gradually become complete. Anyone traveling between Xiamen, He, and Gulangyu must hold a good citizen's exit permit issued by the municipal government with a photo attached before being allowed to pass. Land and sea inspections are extremely strict. Those going to the inland areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou must obtain a passport with a photo attached from the municipal government before being allowed to enter by Zhangzhou and Quanzhou. Those residing in Xiamen City must have the head of the household sign a guarantee that the entire family is good citizens. The arrest of spies and traitors has been extremely strict in recent days. A total of 28 traitors have been executed by firing squad successively: eight people including Guo Hanrui on the 7th, six people including Chen Shaolou on the 9th, eight people including Lin Bingkun on the 11th, and eleven people on the 14th, including six traitors.</p>
<p>When enemy planes attacked Xiamen three times before September 7th, the American Consul received a telegram from Washington, giving a final warning to American overseas Chinese to leave Xiamen and ordering American overseas Chinese in the inland areas of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou to concentrate in Xiamen and evacuate together, otherwise they would not be responsible for their protection. The American Consulate closed itself after the overseas Chinese were evacuated. However, the American Consul stated that it was advising the overseas Chinese to evacuate, not ordering them to evacuate. The overseas Chinese were free to leave or stay. As a result, all the American overseas Chinese were unwilling to leave, and none of the American overseas Chinese in the inland areas were prepared to come to Xiamen and go elsewhere. Those residing in Xiamen even returned to their old residences on Hutou Mountain. The reason is that, in addition to the dozens of people in the Xiamen branches of Mobil and Texaco, the American overseas Chinese in Southern Fujian are mostly pastors, missionaries, teachers, and doctors of Christian churches. They are unwilling to leave, not so much out of sympathy for China as out of their own plans. If they return, they will lose their jobs, and here they can still receive a salary of $150 per month. Since the American overseas Chinese are unwilling to leave, the American Consul is performing his duties as usual. The Mobil and Texaco branches are also operating as usual. Fuzhou is the same as Xiamen, because the American overseas Chinese are unwilling to leave and have stopped. The British Consul has always stated that the British overseas Chinese are determined not to evacuate and are extremely resolute. On the 9th, British Consul Marding, accompanied by the captain of the British warship, visited the Xiamen military and political authorities to discuss cooperation between Xiamen and Gulangyu to jointly maintain security, as the British Consul is also the leading consul and represents the consular corps in administering Gulangyu. On the same day, the Gulangyu Public Concession set up a post on Sunlight Rock, the highest point on the entire island, installed a telephone, and contacted Xiamen for air defense, and severely cracked down on spies in Gulangyu. All high-terrain vantage points are not allowed to be climbed. On the same day, the British Consul issued a circular to British merchants, telling them to return to Xiamen to work, saying that Xiamen is safe and there is absolutely nothing to worry about. On the 10th, shipping companies such as Asia, Taikoo, and the Dutch company Java also moved back to Xiamen from Gulangyu. As for HSBC Bank, it has always been operating in Xiamen and has not moved to Gulangyu. After our official and commercial banks, the telegraph bureau, the post office, and various foreign firms such as Anda Bank moved to Gulangyu, HSBC Bank remained the only one standing tall in Xiamen.</p>
<p>In Zhangzhou and Quanzhou, Quanzhou was affected by Zhangzhou and Xiamen, and shops were closed. The Jinjiang County government set a deadline of September 10th for all of them to reopen, and they have all reopened as scheduled. Quanzhou's rice production is insufficient to meet the needs of the people and relies on external rice supplies. Recently, the four counties of Jinjiang, Nan'an, Yongchun, and Anxi jointly submitted a request to the provincial government and forwarded it to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, which approved the tax-free import of 220,000 bags of foreign rice. The provincial government allocated 50,000 bags each to Fuzhou and Xiamen, 40,000 bags to Jinjiang, and 30,000 bags each to Nan'an, Yongchun, and Dehua. The Jinjiang Chamber of Commerce has invited the Anxi, Nan'an, and Yongchun Chambers of Commerce to hold a joint meeting in Quanzhou to discuss the methods for purchasing and transporting foreign rice. The Ministry of Finance has also promised that if it is still insufficient in the future, it can continue to request tax-free imports. Zhangzhou was attacked by enemy planes once on August 31st and has not been attacked since. However, shops have been greatly affected and most have closed. The Longxi County government strictly ordered all of them to reopen on September 12th, otherwise the shops would be sealed and the goods confiscated. Therefore, the entire city has also reopened on the 12th, and local order is as constant.</p>
<h3>Another Case of Fraudulent Receipts Discovered in the Asian Sound Radio Donation Case</h3>
<p>Temporary Receipts Swapped for Missing Official Receipts, Numbers on Stubs for Gold and Silver Ornaments Do Not Match</p>
<p>In the Asian Sound Radio donation case, due to the occurrence of malpractices, after investigation by the authorities, the Municipal Broadcasting Association, due to its responsibility, has also transferred all the receipt stubs of the radio station to the association for sorting and urged the donors who reported having temporary receipts of the radio station to quickly go to the association to exchange them for official receipts to clarify the truth. Unexpectedly, a Mr. Hong, who lives at No. 17, Fenyang Lane, Fuxu Road, had previously donated 63 yuan and held temporary receipt No. 2708 of the Asian Sound Radio. He went to exchange it yesterday (1st) morning, but found that there was no stub to check and no official receipt. At the same time, it was also discovered that on another receipt No. 1753, about 20 pieces of gold and silver rings, bracelets, ornaments, etc. were donated in total, but the number filled in on the stub did not match the receipt. Moreover, the receipt paper was poor, written in pencil, and unusually simple and sloppy. In an instant, two cases of fraudulent receipts were discovered. It can be seen that the inside story is complicated and cannot be investigated in a short time. At that time, Zhuang Ping, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Xilianyi Association, was also visiting the association to investigate the case, so he witnessed the above situation completely. In addition to asking the association to handle the case prudently with an impartial attitude, it was decided to convene an emergency meeting immediately to discuss the disposal measures.</p>
<h3>Returning Overseas Chinese Talk About the Complete Shutdown of Japanese Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>People Fear Conscription, Tens of Thousands of Overseas Chinese Still Remain</p>
<p>Mr. Xie, an overseas Chinese from Guangdong who returned to China from Japan on the Xinjiang wheel on the 27th of last month, arrived in Shanghai. Due to private affairs, he is still staying in Shanghai and has not returned to his hometown. According to his statement to a reporter from the New News Agency, there were more than 30,000 overseas Chinese in Japan and 5,000 to 6,000 students before the start of the war of resistance. After the 'August 13th' incident, most of the students have returned to China because they were monitored by the Japanese police everywhere and suffered vicious abuse. Two-thirds of the overseas Chinese engaged in commerce have returned to China. Those from southern China have either come to Shanghai or gone to Hong Kong and Xiamen. Most of the overseas Chinese living in Korea are from Hebei and Shandong, so they all took ships from Incheon to Yantai. It is estimated that there are still more than 10,000 overseas Chinese in Japan. These people are all engaged in business and have to endure humiliation and stay due to livelihood and property considerations. Once they return to China, all their property will be confiscated. However, when we left, Tokyo, Osaka, Yokohama, and other places that used to be prosperous have been severely conscripting reservists throughout Japan, causing all Japanese people to live in fear. All industries and commerce have tended to shut down, and the overseas Chinese's businesses have become unsustainable. Therefore, when it is absolutely necessary, the overseas Chinese in Japan will eventually return to China.</p>
<h3>Measures for Soliciting and Handling Comfort Items</h3>
<p>Revised by the Anti-Enemy Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday issued the revised measures for soliciting and handling comfort items as follows: ① In order to adjust the needs and supply of comfort items and to avoid waste of resources and other malpractices, these measures are specially formulated. ② Anyone who needs comfort items is requested to report to the Shanghai Municipal Comfort Committee (hereinafter referred to as the Comfort Committee). ③ Anyone who wants to solicit or collect comfort items on behalf of others must report to the Comfort Committee and obtain its permission. Those who need to use the radio to solicit donations must also contact the Propaganda Committee of the Anti-Enemy Support Association. ④ The groups soliciting comfort items in the previous article should list the names, quantities, and handling methods of the comfort items obtained and report them to the Comfort Committee every month. ⑤ In order to meet the needs of comfort items, the Comfort Committee has the right to dispose of the comfort items of the groups mentioned in Article 3. ⑥ Except for the Comfort Committee, other groups are not allowed to collect comfort money, but this does not apply to donors who voluntarily donate. However, it still needs to be filed with the Comfort Committee. ⑦ The Comfort Committee and the groups mentioned in Article 3 must print and distribute a credibility list of comfort items at the end of each month. ⑧ Before the implementation of these measures, the comfort items collected by various groups shall be reported to the Comfort Committee in a list within three days. ⑨ These measures shall be submitted by the Shanghai Municipal All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association to the party and government organs for record and implementation.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen Departs Tomorrow Evening</h3>
<p>To Manila for Treatment</p>
<p>According to news from the British Consulate, Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen has decided to board the British warship HMS Salamis tomorrow evening and leave Shanghai for Hong Kong on the morning of the 4th, and then go to Manila for treatment. Those accompanying him are his wife and daughter, Miss Alice, and the two Misses Altay. It is expected that he can return to Shanghai before Christmas this year.</p>
<h3>Post Office Reduces Salaries and Allocates Funds to Purchase National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>Due to the sharp decline in revenue of the China Post Administration since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, it has issued a general order to all levels of staff to reduce their salaries by 20% from September. However, the staff in Shanghai are given an additional bonus of 20% due to their heavier duties than elsewhere. It is also stipulated that staff with salaries below 100 yuan should purchase half a month's worth of National Salvation Bonds, those with salaries between 100 and 200 yuan should purchase one month's worth, and those with salaries above 200 yuan should purchase one and a half months' worth, and they are allowed to deduct it from their salaries in installments, limited to the end of this year.</p>
<h3>City Relief Association Ends Its Work</h3>
<p>Sheltering a Maximum of 80,000 People for One and a Half Months, Up to 104 Shelters</p>
<p>The former Shanghai Municipal Relief Committee was closed on September 30th, and all its affairs were handed over to the Emergency Period Refugee Relief Committee. It is learned that since its establishment, from August 12th to September 30th, for a period of more than one and a half months, the total number of refugees sheltered reached a maximum of more than 84,000, and the number of shelters set up reached 104. The number of people sent away totaled more than 70,000. The number of people treated was approximately 20,000, including more than 5,000 men, more than 4,000 women, and more than 7,000 children. The number of deaths was more than 400, including 177 men, 112 women, and 173 children. By the end of the period, the association was still sheltering more than 15,000 refugees in 66 shelters. According to the investigation report of the Municipal Relief Committee, other relief agencies and organizations in the city, as well as various hometown associations, have sheltered a maximum of more than 206,500 people in the past one and a half months, and the number of people sent away totaled 193,200. However, there are no accurate statistics on the number of people treated and the number of deaths. It has been confirmed that more than 1,280 people have been treated and 832 people have died. The current number of people sheltered is 63,045. In addition, the association received a total of 30,721.2 yuan in donations on the 29th and 30th of last month, treated 2,744 refugees, conscripted 165 skilled refugee workers, newly sheltered 737 refugees, provided food for 50,090 refugees. A total of 1,238 refugees were sent away in two batches on the 29th, one batch was sent to Wuxi on the Xiemao Wheel, and one batch of 549 people was sent to Jiaxing on the Daan Wheel. On the 30th, 950 people were sent to Suzhou on the Yongchang Wheel.</p>
<h3>Problem of Relocating Pledged Goods by Various Banks</h3>
<p>The Anti-Enemy Association Is Ordered to Explain</p>
<p>The Municipal All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association previously asked whether the government could order various banks to relocate military supplies related to pledges and deposits without the consent of the pledgers in this extraordinary period, and whether the transportation costs paid by the banks could be charged to the owners or recipients of the goods when they were picked up in the future. The association submitted a request to the Judicial Yuan for interpretation. Yesterday, the association received an instruction from the Judicial Yuan, stating that "If the government orders the relocation of military raw materials related to pledges and deposits in banks and stipulates that the transportation costs paid on behalf of the banks shall still be borne by the owners or recipients of the goods in the future, this emergency order issued by the government for necessary disposal in this extraordinary period should be considered to have general binding force." The association has now forwarded the situation to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform the banking industry association to comply.</p>
<h3>YMCA Broadcasting Service for Soldier News</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the National YMCA of this city, in conjunction with the National YMCA, has launched a service for soldiers, which has been well received by the loyal and brave soldiers defending the country. Therefore, the work has progressed rapidly, and branches have been established on the Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, Beijing-Hankou, and Beijing-Suiyuan lines, respectively organizing officers' clubs, wounded soldiers' clubs, and numerous soldiers' hostels. In order to disseminate news quickly, the association has decided to broadcast news about its service for soldiers to the National YMCA and people from all walks of life every Monday from 8:40 PM to 9:00 PM, starting on October 11th, through the Huamei Radio Station in this city (frequency 600, call sign XMHA). This is intended to facilitate communication and promote progress.</p>
<h3>Christians to Establish Refugee Tuberculosis Sanatorium</h3>
<p>Opening Yesterday - Guidance Welcome</p>
<p>The refugee tuberculosis sanatorium, jointly established by the Shanghai Christian Citizens Committee, the Shanghai Christian Federation, and the Shanghai Christian Wartime Service Corps, has been in preparation for many days. The sanatorium is now located at 35 Avenue Bili Nan, with the capacity to accommodate hundreds of patients. It opened yesterday (the 1st) and is accepting patients with severe tuberculosis. Zhu Lide serves as the president, Chen Changxin as the hospital director, and Ni Junhui, the head of the Shanghai Christian Wartime Service Corps, as the director of hospital affairs. Members of the service corps are responsible for the sanatorium's operations. At the beginning of its establishment, all sectors are welcome to visit and provide guidance. Assistance would be particularly appreciated.</p>

<p>Youth in Wartime, Series 2</p>
<h3>A Model Youth</h3>
<p>— Meng Mei</p>
<p>Since the start of the war of resistance, the entire nation has been able to unite against foreign aggression – of course, with the exception of traitors – contributing all their strength to fight for the survival of the nation and the people. What is particularly admirable is that children, who are still in their childhood, have a patriotic zeal that often surpasses that of ordinary youths and adults!</p>
<p>Look! Here is the most powerful evidence:</p>
<p>‘These past few days, I have seen in the newspapers that Japanese planes are bombing our places everywhere, so I asked my father for a pair of military binoculars and asked you to send them to the soldiers at the front, so that they can see the enemy planes clearly and use anti-aircraft guns to smash them! Sincerely,</p>
<p>He Xiumei, Third Grade Student, Xun Guang Elementary School September 22nd’</p>
<p>What are your thoughts upon reading this event and this letter? In my opinion, in addition to patriotic enthusiasm, she also has the intelligence to immediately think of using binoculars to detect aircraft after seeing planes bombing. She is truly our model!</p>
<h3>Doubt Sickness</h3>
<p>— Yuansheng</p>
<p>On the eve of the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai, we heard many young people's concerns and hesitations. Some doubted that our military strength was sufficient to match the enemy; some worried that internal divisions would arise; some were anxious about the lack of military funds. However, these concerns and hesitations were completely dispelled after the sound of artillery fire.</p>
<p>Facts are the greatest debaters. Look! The achievements of the bloody battle in Shanghai over the past forty days:</p>
<p>Many enemy ships docked in the Huangpu River have been destroyed, and nearly a hundred enemy planes flying between Nanjing and Shanghai have been shot down. Even the so-called most elite Kurume Division has been reduced by two-thirds. This proves that our military strength is no worse than theirs, and that the so-called "illustrious" Imperial Army is nothing more than this.</p>
<p>Since the start of the war of resistance, people of all classes have felt excited, and people with all kinds of ideas have united. (The reorganization of the Red Army into the National Army is one example.) This proves the error in the views of those who worry about our internal divisions.</p>
<p>As for military funds, I dare to believe that China has at least less to worry about than Japan. Assuming that Japan can last for a year, then China can last for three, five, or even ten or eight years. Therefore, to say that China has no way to fund the military, unless Japan's economy collapses first and goes bankrupt first, then someone will believe it.</p>
<p>Indeed, "facts" are the greatest debaters. They can cure young people's "doubt sickness," and they can also persuade and overcome all sophistry and all unnecessary concerns.</p>
<p>Young people, wartime youth! Today, we must have absolute trust in our country. Whether in military affairs, politics, or the overall national policy, we should not have the slightest doubt or concern. We only need to follow four slogans:</p>
<p>"Obey the government, believe in the leader, sacrifice to the end, resist to the end"!</p>
