<p>鎭江附近新景鎭官唐橋一帶、我搜索部隊百餘人、六日上午九時許、與日軍遭遇、日兵四五百名、我以衆寡不敵、頗受壓迫、曾向後退二三公里、至某地卽與敵作戰、我以一部兵力、激戰至四小時左右、雖死傷泰半、而日軍之傷亡更倍於我、我士氣大旺、準備戰至最後一人、至下午一時、另有我另一搜索部隊、約一連左右、自新豐鎭聞得密集槍聲、乃繞至日軍之背後、收夾擊之效、日軍遂不支而潰、遺機槍三挺、棄屍百餘具而逃、我復繼續追擊、又斃日軍一排左右、將其全部擊潰、</p>
<p>［漢口］日軍自前日起、向南京方面之推進、已獲得重要進展、中國方面亦承認句容及天王寺均已失陷、日軍之離南京僅三十哩、但今晚中國最高指揮方面、仍重申守衛南京之决心、中國丹陽方面駐軍已退至鎭江、相信日軍將對鎭江大舉總攻、該城日來日機襲炸頗烈、本來之三萬人口、幾已撤退一空云、（六日國民海通電）</p>
<p>▲本埠訊　美聯社記者據華方今晨消息、在此四日之內、廣德屢失屢得凡三次、日昨廣德又告克復、照目下情形觀之、南東方面之决戰已迫於眉睫、華方之主力部隊、自昨日起、已集中於鎭江•句容•及溧水西北一帶、鎭江句容均在華軍手中、惟溧水方面因戰略關係、華軍已於昨日放棄、向西北移動、江陰方面之封鎖綫、日軍雖連日進行破壞、卒未得逞、昨晨從溧水方面有日軍約二百餘人圍攻句容、但以人數過少、而華軍在句容方面之勢力又甚雄厚、經數度交鋒後、卒被華軍圍困於土橋鎭（在句容之西）相近之山區內、日軍雖深感南京一帶地形困難、不易攻擊、然昨日會由郎溪（皖境、在廣德之西）方面、向南進發、與華軍之反攻部隊相持、聞日軍在該處之陣綫、已被華軍突破數處、又從廣德及泗安推進之華軍部隊、於日前克復長興後、卽向吳興推進、企圖與該處之華軍取得連絡、再大事進展、在吳興東門一帶、中國別動隊甚為活躍云、（六日國民社）</p>
<p>江陰要塞雖已失守數日、而我封鎖綫則安如磐石、日軍三四日來、每次均派轟炸機二三架輪流轟炸、迄未毀開、日艦至今午仍在我封鎖綫以下數英里處停泊、一般人預料日軍如遲遲不能突破此綫、或將在北岸企圖登陸、</p>
<p>［東京］日本軍事觀察家豫料、南京將於五日內陷落、至遲在十二月十五日、今日下午此間大本營發表公報稱、南京四周之日軍陣綫、現逐漸縮短、星期日正午、日軍已進至距南京東南十二哩半之處云、又據報紙登載上海來電稱、日軍艦破江陰封鎖綫掃除江面之水雷、已溯江而上、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>據日方消息、由丹陽前進之片桐•大野•野田•助川•各部隊、並由金壇向左側壓迫之伊佐•藤井•脇坂•人見•等部隊、共同進迫句容、今與南京城相距又縮短十里、一方安達•永津•淺間•各部、復向鎭江前方洪山陸村舖方面急進、惟西面係山嶽地帶、遮蔽南京北方、至於在溧水之某部、及山及長野部隊、集合於前方的十五基羅之平原、以圖截斷華軍退走蕪湖之路、橫斷太湖之角岡小澤野副之全軍、今巳佔領溧水南方之鄧埠鎭、又訊、佔據溧水之日軍某部、五日上午、已向鳥山鎭前進、佔據句容之某部、已抵戎崗頭、</p>
<p>據日方消息、由廣德向寗國前進之某部隊、已越十字舖朱塘舖、於五日正午抵距廣德十五六公里之洪林橋、華軍主力部隊今正由蕪湖南下、向寗口徽州堵截中、</p>
<h3>我軍隊决死守南京</h3>
<p>［南京］南京事今實上已實行戒嚴、各街道皆有小隊佩帶黃色臂章之士兵巡邏、下關江邊一帶、常有無目的之士兵成羣結隊、俳徊其間、並時有扣留車輛船隻之企圖、如不加以約束、恐有發生紛擾之可能、迄今大局尚在當局控制中、當局一再聲明、萬一退出時、並無燬城之意、惟中國軍隊將死守首都、已頗明顯、故一般外國觀察家以為、戰事結果、除城內有放火焚燒之可能外、更將引起絕大之損害、美人捐資建立之金陵女子大學房屋、已從事準備、以便萬一發生危險時、供婦孺避難之用、同時據安全區域委員會宣佈、目下該區食糧尚不充足、凡欲移入該區居住者、均須自帶食物、此外、並鼓勵區內各商店照常營業、聞中國當局已向安全區域委員會保證、當於三日內、將該區附近之一切軍事設備、概予撤除、（六日路透電）</p>
<p>［南京］此間之難民區、雖尚來獲得日人尊重之保證、但今日仍有數千難民絡繹遷入、其他之貧苦難民則多將其行李、背負肩挑、或雇人力車運載往浦口避難、（五民國電）</p>
<h3>江陰兩師壯烈犧牲</h3>
<p>［漢口］今日中國官方證實江陰要塞業已失守、該地中國軍隊兩師人、業已壯烈犧牲、按江陰陣地為突出部份、日軍大舉包圍、守軍四面被圍、猶且效死相持、上自將軍下至士卒、均以身殉、靡有孑遺、華軍之此種犧牲、亦非毫無意義、蓋在華軍與日軍相持之時、一部份留後之軍隊、得以從容毀滅砲位、不使資敵也、又訊、江陰常熟之失守、據中國方面意見、乃日軍在太湖方面進展之結果、因江陰常熟佐于太湖北岸、有受包圍之危險、故華方不能增援云、（六日國民海通電）</p>

<h3>難民區設施一斑</h3>
<p>難民區郵件已恢復</p>
<p>南市難民區內郵件遞送、頃已恢復、居戶及難民、可將信件投置郵筒送出、外來郵件、由郵差每日分上下午兩班遞送、難民中寫信因不識字而發生困難者、由各區區長下文書股盡力協助之、故咸稱便利、</p>

<p>難民區為使居民及難民容易辨認並管理上便利起見、頃已分發紅白符號兩種、凡區內原有居民佩帶紅色符號、難民則佩白色符號、難民無事不得外出、故街頭里弄、絕無嘈雜情事、尤以紅卐字會主持下之城隍廟一帶、街道淸潔、秩序井然、令人有不知此為難民區之感想、</p>
<p>區內將增設收容所</p>
<p>現區內商店已有一部復業、國際救濟會並擬在九區內每區設一煤球店、以便供應區內居民、又連日經法租界入難民區者、平均每日在三百人以上、故區內人數漸見增加、而原有各收容所、亦有擁擠過甚者、故該會决增設收容所、以資容納、至區內死亡人數、因改給飯食後、營養已見充分、業已减少、又最近由中華慈幼協會在安仁街九號設立災童醫院一所、</p>
<p>建造木柵以策安全</p>
<p>區內秩序、除由法當局派捕維持外、頃救濟會駐區辦事處、復成立糾察隊、每天分三班、每班四人、分赴各區巡査、保護居民、為更策安全起見、並擬在難民區四週各街道口、及九區之重要交界地段、仿城區三十年前之辦法、雇工建造木柵、以資衛護、該項木柵裝置後、卽按照目前夜間警戒辦法、凖時啟閉、</p>

<p>災童收容所昨遷址</p>
<p>中華慈幼協會、以在大通路白克路所設之災童收容所、地位狹隘、難於擴充、自經擇定曹家渡聖約翰靑年中學為新址、連日積極佈置、已吿就緒、茲悉該會已於昨日起開始遷移、約三日可以遷竣、至雖民區災童、一部份亦可望於短時期內遷入、此次所遷新址、足容一千餘名、內部設備、亦更見週全、至該會為派員赴平漢綫救濟災童一節、亦已於昨日幹事會議中、商定切實辦法、</p>
<h3>日兵逮捕大東旅館四客</h3>
<p>帶往日軍司令部訊問　約一小時後復經釋出　工部局向首席領事抗議</p>
<p>關於武裝日兵進入大東旅社、並將居於該旅社內之華人數名捕去問話之經過事實、業經工部局警務處長向該局報吿、聞該局對於此事之全部、已加以急迫考慮、並立卽向首席領事遞交抗議書、</p>
<p>直入大東</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今晨（六日）六時前、有汽車二輛、載日領署警察、駛過外白渡橋、至南京路大東旅館前停車、卽入內將中國寓客四人、內有女子一人、拘解虹口日軍司令部、當時大東旅館經理曾發電話通報老閘捕房、但已不及挽回、日人十二名、分持來福鎗與手鎗、有戎裝者、有便服者、擁入旅館、毫未受有抵抗、卽直趨三○九號•三一○號•房間、</p>
<p>逮捕四客</p>
<p>其內設有楊記（譯音）絲公司事務所、當將楊某•黃某•與另一男子並一婦人拘入汽車、循南京路外白渡橋飛馳而入虹口、馬路上雖偶開紅燈停車信號、亦不之顧、直衝而過、四人在日軍司令部略經詢問後、於一小時後釋出、日人此舉、是否出於誤拘、抑欲藉此表示日人得隨時在公共租界內單獨自由行動、須俟捕房査明後始能决定、</p>
<p>捕房調查</p>
<p>老閘捕房現正調査此案、已傳四人至捕房問話、工部局警務處副總巡阿佛斯僅由大東旅館報吿、始知此事、此外未得任何情報、按大東旅館乃在香港註册之永安公司附設、又按南京路炸彈案發生後、日當局曾向總巡裘拉德提出要求四項、</p>
<p>外人注意</p>
<p>其第一項為日軍於必要時、得隨時經過公共租界、而不豫先通知工部局、其第四項為輔助工部局維持公共租界治安起見、日軍視為必要時、可在租界內取單獨行動、調査並研訊嫌疑者、及其他行動、此項要求、未經裘氏接受、其覆日當局僅謂來文讀悉、已轉呈長官核奪云、後此遂無所聞、自今晨大東旅館案發生後、外人觀察家復憶及此項要求矣、</p>
<p>馳車急迫</p>
<p>今晨九時後、有日人所乘汽車三輛、在南京路向東飛馳、不顧沿途紅燈信號、第一輛有日人三四名立於脚踏板上喇叭之聲、高鳴不絕、指揮燈號之巡捕均被迫急忙攔阻橫街之車輛、以免肇禍、據在南京路行走之外人聲稱、第一車之乘者、似為日領署警官、</p>
<h3>太極圖紙旗沒收</h3>
<p>字林報云、昨（五日）有一華人、挾紙旗一束、在浦灘散給黃包車夫等、當為巡捕拘送捕房、旗為黃色、上有太極圖、分紅綠兩色、據謂乃浦東農民用以表示對該處日軍之友好者、該華人所挾之旗十餘面、均經沒收、</p>
<p>華東社云、昨日午前十一時、法大馬路愛多亞路一帶、有男女多人、手執黃色太極圖小旗、結隊遊行、租界當局、以其有礙治安、當卽驅散、聞滬西一帶、亦有此種旗幟發現云、</p>
<h3>高橋綫加輪運客</h3>
<p>增派兩輪行駛</p>
<p>浦江東西交通、自高橋綫開放後、連日往來渡客、頗為擁擠、卽遠至松江金山平湖各地鄕民、因南市及南黃浦面、水陸兩受阻隔、故均不嫌長途跋涉、輾轉繞道至浦東高橋鎮、搭渡輪來滬、至於由滬返鄕者、亦賴此為唯一途徑、渡輪方面、因每班不敷裝運、昨由英商馬勒公司狄納號、與德商利和公司新江南號兩輪同行加開一班、全日往返高滬兩地、各開三班、總計昨日所載渡客、約達萬五千名、浦東蔬菜又有大批運來、故本市菜價、勢將逐漸回跌矣、</p>

<h3>Our Military Authorities Vow to Defend Nanjing to the Death</h3>
<p>Our Right-Wing Forces Attack Wuxing from Three Sides; Japanese Lines at Langxi Breached by Our Forces; Fierce Battles Rage at Jurong and Lishui</p>
<p>The focus of the Eastern Theater's battles has shifted west to the Zhenjiang, Jurong, and Lishui line after our forces withdrew from the three strongholds of Danyang, Jintan, and Liyang. This line serves as the gateway to Nanjing, and our military authorities have made an unwavering resolution to defend the capital. On this defensive line protecting the capital, we are determined to engage in an unprecedented decisive battle with the Japanese army. According to recent front-line reports from the past two days, after invading Danyang, Jintan, Liyang, and other areas, the Japanese army is using its powerful military strength to advance step by step towards Zhenjiang, Jurong, and Lishui, intending to advance by both land and water to complete a grand encirclement strategy. Their intention to first seize Zhenjiang to open up the Yangtze River waterway for a naval advance is also very clear. Our military authorities are fully aware of the Japanese army's conspiracy. Therefore, in addition to deploying a very strong second line of blockade on the Zhenjiang riverfront, there are also meticulous preparations for land fortifications in the Zhenjiang, Jurong, and Lishui area. At the same time, our right-wing forces are ordered to fiercely attack the rear of the Japanese army, preventing them from attending to both ends and trapping them in a desperate situation. The front-line reports from the past two days have proven that this plan is progressing. The most recent news obtained by this newspaper from various sources is as follows: ㊀ The Japanese army advancing along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway line from Danyang has been contained by our army at the Xinfeng Station and Chaze area. Intense fighting continued there yesterday morning. The Japanese army invading Jurong from Jintan was forced to approach the suburbs in the past two days. A fierce battle for control took place on the northeast side of the city from yesterday morning until noon. At the same time, a portion of the Japanese army took the highway, attempting to link up with the Japanese army on the railway line to flank Zhenjiang, but they have been strictly blocked by our army in the Bagang area. Also, the Japanese army advancing head-on along the highway to Tianwang Temple from Jintan, equipped with mechanized units, launched a fierce attack. Our army, considering the unfavorable terrain there and the threat to Jurong, slightly shifted its position west before dawn yesterday. ㊁ The Japanese army advancing west from Liyang, after occupying the Shangxingbu town, immediately pressed towards Lishui with heavy troops. A bloody battle is currently unfolding on the southeast side of the area. Our army is very strong on the northwest side, and there is close communication with the Jurong-Zhenjiang line. Furthermore, our large force of fresh troops guarding the capital have not yet been ordered to participate in the battle. It is estimated that our military strength in the area exceeds 500,000 troops. It will be difficult for the Japanese army to occupy Nanjing before the 15th of this month. Moreover, according to reliable information obtained yesterday, our right wing, with elite troops, launched a fierce offensive against the Japanese army, recapturing Guangde and Changxing, and then advanced south, attacking Wuxing from three sides. Yesterday, the suburbs of the city were already surrounded by our army. The recapture of Wuxing is imminent. If our army can advance further north and attack the rear of the central and left-wing Japanese forces, the Japanese army will inevitably be trapped in a desperate situation, and the situation on the Eastern Theater will also change dramatically.</p>
<p>Around Xin Jingzhen and Guantang Bridge near Zhenjiang, about a hundred of our search troops encountered the Japanese army at around 9:00 AM on the sixth. The Japanese soldiers numbered four to five hundred. Due to numerical inferiority, we were under considerable pressure and retreated two to three kilometers. We then engaged the enemy at a certain location. With a portion of our forces, we fought fiercely for about four hours. Although most of us were killed or wounded, the Japanese army suffered even greater casualties. Our morale was high, and we prepared to fight to the last man. At 1:00 PM, another of our search troops, about a company, heard dense gunfire from Xinfengzhen and circled behind the Japanese army, achieving a flanking effect. The Japanese army was then unable to withstand the attack and collapsed, abandoning three machine guns and over a hundred corpses while fleeing. We continued to pursue, killing about a platoon of Japanese soldiers and completely routing them.</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Japanese army's advance towards Nanjing since the day before yesterday has made significant progress. The Chinese side also acknowledges that Jurong and Tianwang Temple have fallen. The Japanese army is only thirty miles from Nanjing, but tonight, the Chinese high command reiterated its determination to defend Nanjing. The Chinese garrison in the Danyang area has retreated to Zhenjiang. It is believed that the Japanese army will launch a full-scale offensive against Zhenjiang. The city has been heavily bombed by Japanese planes in recent days, and its original population of 30,000 has almost entirely evacuated. (National Maritime Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<p>▲ Local News: According to news received by the Associated Press reporter from the Chinese side this morning, Guangde has been lost and regained three times in the past four days. Guangde was reportedly recaptured yesterday. Judging from the current situation, the decisive battle in the southeast is imminent. Since yesterday, the main force of the Chinese side has been concentrated in the Zhenjiang, Jurong, and northwest of Lishui area. Zhenjiang and Jurong are both in the hands of the Chinese army, but Lishui was abandoned by the Chinese army yesterday and moved northwest due to strategic considerations. Although the Japanese army has been carrying out sabotage on the blockade line in the Jiangyin area for days, they have ultimately failed. Yesterday morning, about two hundred Japanese soldiers attacked Jurong from the Lishui area, but due to their small number and the strong forces of the Chinese army in Jurong, they were surrounded by the Chinese army in the mountainous area near Tuqiao town (west of Jurong) after several encounters. Although the Japanese army deeply feels that the terrain around Nanjing is difficult and not easy to attack, they advanced south yesterday from Langxi (Anhui province, west of Guangde) and engaged in a standoff with the Chinese counter-attacking forces. It is reported that the Japanese lines in that area have been breached in several places by the Chinese army. In addition, the Chinese troops advancing from Guangde and Si'an, after recapturing Changxing a few days ago, advanced towards Wuxing, attempting to establish contact with the Chinese army there and make further progress. Chinese commando units are very active in the east gate area of Wuxing. (National News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Although the Jiangyin Fortress has been lost for several days, our blockade line remains as solid as a rock. For the past three or four days, the Japanese army has sent two or three bombers each time to bomb in rotation, but they have not been able to destroy it. The Japanese warships are still anchored several miles below our blockade line as of noon today. It is generally expected that if the Japanese army cannot break through this line soon, they may attempt to land on the north bank.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese military observers predict that Nanjing will fall within five days, at the latest by December 15. This afternoon, the General Headquarters here issued a communique stating that the Japanese army lines around Nanjing are gradually shortening. At noon on Sunday, the Japanese army had advanced to a point twelve and a half miles southeast of Nanjing. Furthermore, newspapers reported a dispatch from Shanghai stating that Japanese warships have broken through the Jiangyin blockade line, cleared mines from the river surface, and are heading upstream. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, the Katagiri, Ono, Noda, and Sukegawa units advancing from Danyang, as well as the Isa, Fujii, Wakisaka, and Hitomi units pressing from the left flank from Jintan, are jointly approaching Jurong, further shortening the distance from Nanjing city by ten li. Meanwhile, the Adachi, Nagatsu, and Asama units are rapidly advancing towards the Hongshan Lucunpu area ahead of Zhenjiang. However, the western area is a mountainous region, shielding the north of Nanjing. As for a certain unit in Lishui, as well as the Yamasaki and Nagano units, they are gathering on the fifteen-kilometer-long plain ahead, intending to cut off the Chinese army's retreat to Wuhu. The entire army of Kakooka Ozawa Noyori, which crosses Lake Taihu, has now occupied Dengbu Town south of Lishui. Also, a message indicates that a certain unit of the Japanese army occupying Lishui advanced towards Toriyama Town on the morning of the 5th, and a certain unit occupying Jurong has reached Ronggangtou.</p>
<p>According to Japanese sources, a certain unit advancing from Guangde towards Ningguo crossed Shizipu and Zhutangpu, and reached Honglin Bridge, fifteen or sixteen kilometers from Guangde, at noon on the 5th. The main force of the Chinese army is now moving south from Wuhu, blocking the Ningguo and Huizhou areas.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Resolve to Defend Nanjing to the Death</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Martial law has now been effectively implemented in Nanjing. Small squads of soldiers wearing yellow armbands patrol the streets. In the Xiaguan riverside area, aimless soldiers often wander around in groups and attempt to detain vehicles and ships from time to time. If they are not restrained, there is a possibility of disturbances. So far, the overall situation is still under the control of the authorities. The authorities have repeatedly stated that there is no intention to destroy the city in the event of a withdrawal. However, it is quite clear that the Chinese army will defend the capital to the death. Therefore, general foreign observers believe that the results of the battle, in addition to the possibility of arson in the city, will cause enormous damage. The buildings of Jinling Women's University, established with American donations, are being prepared to provide refuge for women and children in case of danger. At the same time, the Safety Zone Committee announced that the food supply in the area is currently insufficient. Anyone wishing to move into the area must bring their own food. In addition, it encourages shops in the area to continue business as usual. It is reported that the Chinese authorities have guaranteed to the Safety Zone Committee that all military installations near the area will be removed within three days. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Although the refugee zone here has not yet received a guarantee of respect from the Japanese, thousands of refugees are still moving in one after another today. Other poor refugees mostly carry their luggage on their backs or hire rickshaws to transport it to Pukou for refuge. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Two Divisions of Jiangyin Make Heroic Sacrifice</h3>
<p>[Hankou] Today, Chinese officials confirmed that the Jiangyin Fortress has fallen. Two divisions of Chinese troops in the area have made a heroic sacrifice. The Jiangyin position was an exposed salient, and the Japanese army launched a large-scale encirclement. The defending forces were surrounded on all sides, yet they still held out with mortal determination. From generals to soldiers, all died for the country without a single survivor. This sacrifice by the Chinese army is not without significance, as while the Chinese army held the Japanese army, a portion of the rear-guard troops were able to calmly destroy the artillery positions, preventing them from falling into enemy hands. Furthermore, according to the Chinese side, the loss of Jiangyin Changshu is a result of the Japanese army's progress in the Taihu area. Because Jiangyin Changshu are adjacent to the north bank of Taihu, they were in danger of being surrounded, so the Chinese side could not send reinforcements. (National Maritime Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>National Government Issues a Clear Order to Commend Hao Mengling and Others</h3>
<p>Hao Posthumously Awarded the Rank of Army General</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Chongqing, 6th: The National Government ordered on the 6th: ㊀ Hao Mengling, Commander of the Ninth Route Army of the Army, Liu Jiaqi, Commander of the 54th Division, and Zheng Yanzhen, Commander of the 5th Independent Brigade, were loyal to the revolution and have long been known for their meritorious service.

<h3>Huang Shaoxiong and Others</h3>
<p>Arrived in Zhejiang Yesterday</p>
<p>A telegram from Jinhua on the 6th received by foreign sources in this city states that the newly appointed Chairman of Zhejiang, Huang Shaoxiong, the Director of the Construction Department, Wu Tingyang, and the Acting Secretary-General, Li Limin, and their party, arrived in Zhejiang from Nanchang on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway special train on the 5th. The train arrived at Jinhua Station at 10:00 PM. Huang and Wu alighted from the train and spent a short time with the welcoming party. Half an hour later, the train continued to Hangzhou and is scheduled to take over duties in Hangzhou on the morning of the 6th. According to Huang, this time I have come to Zhejiang, everything is for the sake of resisting the war. An investigation shows that the period of smooth military progress for the Japanese army's invasion of our country has passed, and it is now in a difficult stage. In the battles in Jin Province, the Japanese army has suffered more than 30,000 deaths. In the future, the deeper the Japanese army goes into the interior, the more difficult it will feel. If 500,000 Japanese troops are trapped in our interior for battle, our army will carry out a protracted attrition against them. After three years of resistance, the final victory will surely belong to us. Because our current battle is only a political failure, not a military failure. I have great determination on this and anticipate the final victory. Therefore, we people must maintain absolute optimism about the war situation. Regarding the issues of refugees and wounded soldiers, since western Zhejiang has fallen, there are indeed many refugees who should be accommodated and rescued. Seriously wounded soldiers should be severely punished, otherwise they should be given preferential treatment. Therefore, the handling is not a problem. During wartime, finances are difficult, and we should all endure hardship and lower our living standards. After the wartime results, we will then restore them, etc. It is heard that after Huang arrives in Zhejiang, he will make new efforts in the restoration of transportation and the self-defense of the people. The new Secretary-General, He Yangling, did not come along and is heard to be coming to Zhejiang in a few days. The new Director of the Zhejiang Civil Affairs Department, Wang Xianqiang, can arrive in Jin on the 6th. Zhu Jiahua will go to Hankou after completing the handover.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang and His Wife Are Still in Nanjing</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to reliable news from Chinese sources, Chairman Chiang and his wife are currently in Nanjing and have no intention of leaving the capital. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<h3>Chiang Instructs Local Officials to Uphold the Meaning of Defending Their Territory with Responsibility</h3>
<p>If Counties in the War Zone Fall, They Must Relocate and Continue Working; Those Who Flee at the First Sign of Danger Will Be Severely Punished; Those Who Fulfill Their Duties to the Utmost Will Also Be Promoted Beyond Grade</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Hankou, 6th: Chairman Chiang, considering that during the war of resistance, the provincial governments, administrative inspectors, and county magistrates in the war zones are responsible for defending their territory and governing the people. If the county seat or county station falls, or the provincial capital relocates, they should relocate to rural areas or subordinate counties and provinces to continue working. They must not flee at the first sign of danger, otherwise they will be subject to military law. Yesterday, he specially telegraphed to the provincial governments in the war zones to relay to the commissioners and county magistrates, saying: "The state establishes officials to defend their territory and govern the people, which is their inescapable responsibility. Defending against disasters is their rightful duty. Examining past history, whenever there were foreign invasions, there were always worthy people who dedicated their lives and did not leave, achieving benevolence and taking righteousness. Their uprightness shines brightly, like the sun and the stars. The reason why our Chinese nation can stand independent in the world to this day, and not become a slave to foreign races, is purely due to this supreme spirit. This war of resistance concerns the life and death of the entire nation, and the whole country knows that we must fight persistently to win the final victory. Therefore, in the initial stages of the war, the coastal areas will inevitably be ravaged, and the Japanese army will inevitably penetrate deep into our territory. This was already anticipated by us. However, our strategy for controlling the Japanese is that, in military terms, although strategy requires us to retreat, we must resist strongly at every step and launch surprise attacks everywhere, and we will never allow them to drive straight in and occupy us safely. In political terms, although towns and cities will inevitably be abandoned, the villages and people must still be tightly controlled by local governments at all levels, exercising governance, and we will never allow them to be bewildered, without a master, and fall apart. We must ensure that the Japanese army has no place that can be pacified with a simple announcement, and no people who can be ordered around. Then, the deeper they invade, the more dispersed their forces, and the more difficult their defenses. Everywhere will be a field of thorns and thistles, and they will inevitably have a day of exhaustion. Then, our soldiers who dedicate their lives will counterattack in front, and the people in the war zone will respond from within. The purpose of the so-called final victory will be achieved with blood. I believe that local officials at all levels have a deep understanding of the cause and effect of this. This Chairman of the Committee especially issues a strict order. If the county town falls in any county or local area of the war zone, the county government should immediately relocate to the rural area under its jurisdiction and continue working. If this rural area falls again, then it should relocate to another rural area. As long as there is an inch of land and three households of people, the administrative organization will not disintegrate, and the work will not be interrupted. The same applies to administrative inspectors and provincial governments. If the county station falls, it should be relocated to another adjacent county. If the provincial government is forced, it should be moved to a suitable location to continue supervising and encouraging its subordinates to handle all post-war relief and the organization and training of the people, providing strong assistance to the combat troops. When it is necessary to move, all local able-bodied men and accumulated materials should be relocated as much as possible, and should not be hastily abandoned and left in disarray. If local governments can make advance arrangements and adapt to changing circumstances, there will be ample time to relocate. This is related to the success or failure of our war of resistance. All local officials at all levels must carefully consider their responsibilities and strictly comply. This Chairman of the Committee will use this to examine them. If anyone flees at the first sign of danger, causing local management to be disorganized and chaotic, they will be subject to military law and severely punished immediately. Those who can show courage in the face of danger, defend their territory with merit, and fulfill their duties to the utmost to complete their missions will be promoted beyond grade and given special honors to serve as a model. This Chairman of the Committee's orders will be followed to the letter, and there will be no leniency. Do not regard them as mere formalities. All must comply with caution and importance.

<h3>Japanese Planes Fiercely Bomb Wuhu; Two British Ships Destroyed</h3>
<p>The De He Completely Burned Down; The Da Tong Pierced in Several Places; British Gunboat Also Affected</p>
<p>[Wuhu] An Associated Press reporter has learned that Japanese planes bombed here around 11:00 AM on the 5th, hitting two British ships. The British gunboat HMS Gnat was also affected by bomb shrapnel, damaging its hull. One of the British ships was the Jardine Matheson's Da Tong, which was hit by two bombs, injuring Captain Malister's left arm. The other was the Butterfield &amp; Swire's De He, which caught fire immediately after being hit. Many passengers rushed to jump into the river. As far as is known, at least fourteen Chinese people died on board, and countless others were injured, all of whom were taken to a hospital by the river for treatment. Thirty people underwent surgery, and three had limbs amputated. According to Ms. Milme, an American nurse at the hospital who witnessed the Japanese bombing, Japanese planes had been circling over Wuhu for several minutes before the incident. At the time, I was busy with work and did not have time to go out and watch. Later, I heard the sound of bombs and ran to the window to look out. I saw four Japanese planes circling in the air, taking turns dropping bombs. Then I saw a bomb hit the De He, and the ship immediately caught fire. The Japanese planes dropped about sixteen bombs, many of which landed on sand barges and other small boats in the river. The sounds of tragic screams and cries, and the chaotic scene of people rushing to escape and throwing themselves into the river, were beyond description. This lasted for about five minutes. The hospital received more than seventy injured people, and many more were presumably treated on their own. The sight of children who had lost their parents standing in front of the hospital crying for their parents, and relatives searching for their children by the river, was especially tragic and unbearable to witness. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Mr. Morris, the chief engineer of the Swire Company's Da Tong ship, was injured by fragments of Japanese aircraft bombs in Wuhu and has been admitted to the hospital, but his injuries are not serious. Eight Chinese were killed and twenty injured on the Da Tong and De He ships. The Swire Company's ship Wan was also severely damaged below the waterline. The tugboat He He (transliteration) left Nanjing yesterday for Wuhu, carrying five De He crew members and fifty Chinese sailors to this location. They have lost everything and are expected to arrive here this afternoon. Captain Harrison remains in Wuhu. There are currently 117 foreigners in Wuhu, including 30 British citizens and 40 Spanish nuns. The nuns reside in the Asia Petroleum Company's warehouse during the day, while the British residents reside on the company's ship Shaoguan (transliteration). The ship narrowly escaped disaster yesterday when a bomb landed in the river twenty yards away. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] This morning, all newspapers prominently published the news of yesterday's Japanese aircraft bombing of two British ships in Wuhu and the extensive damage to British property. However, there has been no commentary on the issue so far. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Hankou] When Japanese aircraft bombed British ships in Wuhu yesterday, two foreigners were slightly injured by bomb fragments: Lieutenant Commander Barrow of the British gunboat HMS Gnat and Mr. Morris, the chief engineer of the Swire Company's Da Tong ship. According to a foreign eyewitness, the Japanese planes flew at an altitude of 6,000 feet and dropped six bombs aimed at the British ships. The British ships and lighters were flying prominent British flags. At the time, there were no Chinese soldiers in Wuhu. Only some Chinese refugees were boarding civilian boats, preparing to leave. When the Japanese planes dropped bombs, many refugees fell into the river while trying to escape. The De He caught fire fiercely after being hit, and the entire ship was destroyed. The captain and crew boarded the British gunboat HMS Gnat and stood on the deck, watching their ship slowly burn down. The fire was still burning this morning. The Da Tong had many holes and has run aground on the riverbank. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Lieutenant Wickley, an officer on the British gunboat HMS Gnat stationed in Wuhu, fell into the river from the ship at 6:30 PM last night. After an hour of searching, he was nowhere to be found. (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] After the British merchant ships De He and Da Tong, sailing on the Yangtze River in China, were bombed by Japanese aircraft in Wuhu yesterday, British diplomatic circles declined to comment. They only stated that whether a protest would be lodged with the Japanese authorities would depend on the completion of an investigation by the local British authorities. (6th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Local News) Japanese aircraft bombed the Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson Yangtze River steamers Da Tong and De He in Wuhu, sinking one and damaging the other. The Japanese aircraft also bombed and destroyed the port's warehouses and lighters. The crew and passengers suffered heavy casualties. This incident has caused serious disputes. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Da Tong of Swire Company and the De He of Jardine Matheson were both regular ships sailing on the Yangtze River. Since our army blockaded Jiangyin on August 13, the two ships have been blocked upstream, continuing to sail between Nanjing and Hankou to maintain transportation. This time, the Da Tong of Swire Company was carrying goods and passengers from Nanjing to Hankou, while the De He of Jardine Matheson was carrying goods and passengers from Hankou downstream to Nanjing. Both arrived in Wuhu on the morning of the 5th and docked at the lighters for passengers to board and disembark. Around 11:00 AM, several Japanese planes suddenly flew to the riverside and circled the moored ships, seemingly scouting everything, before flying away. (About twenty yards away from the De He was the Asia Petroleum Company's Shou Guang. Both the tops of Swire's Da Tong and Jardine Matheson's De He were painted with very large British flags. The sides of the ships were also painted with flags, and the lighters also had them. The British flag on the roof of the Swire Company's warehouse was even more conspicuous.) At 11:30 AM, six Japanese bombers came for the second time and began to bomb the two Yangtze River ships. According to a wireless message sent by the British warship in Wuhu to Jardine Matheson, six Japanese planes bombed the two Yangtze River ships from 11:30 AM for twenty minutes, dropping a total of twelve heavy bombs. The first bomb hit the De He, and the De He immediately caught fire and burned until the entire ship was destroyed, leaving a remnant hull that then sank into the river. According to the Wuhu telegram received by Swire Company, the bomb dropped by the Japanese plane hit the top of the Da Tong, went straight down through the painted British flag, and landed in the engine room. The bomb ruptured the bottom of the ship, and water flooded the central cabin in an instant. However, it did not catch fire, but shrapnel flew everywhere, killing three people and wounding eight on the spot. The Western chief mate was seriously injured. Seeing that the ship was about to sink, the captain quickly ran the ship aground on the river beach, while rescuing the injured and sending them to local hospitals. After the Japanese planes achieved their goal of bombing the ships, they continued to bomb a warehouse of the Swire Company on the riverbank and a Jardine Matheson lighter used for mooring ships, finally ending the bombing at 11:50 AM. It is said that there were no Chinese troops stationed there. The reason for the Japanese bombing is unclear. All of Jardine Matheson's Wuhu lighter workers and De He crew members who were not injured left Wuhu for Hankou yesterday. It has been verified that the sunken De He ship weighed 3,770 tons and was built in 1904. The damaged Da Tong ship weighed 1,560 tons and was built in 1891.</p>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, a wireless message was received in Shanghai last night (the 5th) stating that when Japanese planes attacked Wuhu yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the British gunboat HMS Gnat, the ship De He, and the Swire ship Da Tong were all bombed. No foreigners were killed or injured on the three ships, but it was not mentioned whether any Chinese were killed or injured. It is believed that one of the two ships must have been carrying many Chinese refugees when it was hit. The captain of the De He was Mr. Harrison. The ship was moored next to the Jardine Matheson lighter when it was hit. Both the De He and the lighter were hit by bombs and caught fire, and are now believed to have been burned down. The Da Tong was hit by a bomb, causing water to rush into the engine room. Fortunately, it was quickly run aground on the riverbank, avoiding sinking. The HMS Gnat suffered the least damage. Although it was hit by bomb fragments, there was no serious damage above or below the deck, and none of the sailors on board were injured. The gunboat weighed 650 tons and has been on patrol duty for the past ten years. According to wireless messages, the Japanese planes dropped a total of six bombs in the area where the three British ships were moored. The attack was carried out by two bombers and two fighters. The Chinese were greatly alarmed at the time. The De He was en route from Hankou to Nanjing, and the Da Tong was probably heading upstream. This news was first received by the British naval authorities in Shanghai, having been sent by wireless from the HMS Gnat, whose wireless equipment was apparently not damaged by the bombing.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, a wireless message was received in Shanghai yesterday afternoon stating that when Japanese planes attacked Wuhu, in addition to bombing three British ships, they also dropped six bombs near Chejie. One bomb penetrated the roof of the Swire Company warehouse, which was painted with the British coat of arms. Another bomb exploded twenty yards away from where the Asia Petroleum Company ship Shaoguan (transliteration) was moored. The De He burned fiercely from beginning to end. When the Da Tong was hit by a bomb, a Swire lighter sank as a result. Another lighter was towed upstream to a safe location by the gunboat HMS Gnat, which then returned and moored next to the De He. Both companies' employees do not understand why the Japanese planes bombed the British ships. In addition to flying British flags, both ships had British coats of arms painted on their decks and sides. Since the Jiangyin blockade, the two ships have been traveling between Nanjing and Hankou, providing convenient transportation.</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury, officers of the British Yangtze River Fleet are currently investigating the case of the Japanese aircraft bombing British ships in Wuhu. Both companies have taken no action pending receipt of further details. The British consular authorities have also not yet protested the case. Serious action is expected.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Nanjing and Guangzhou</h3>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Says Japanese Military Parade in Shanghai Concession Was a Provocation</h3>
<p>Ishii Arrives in London to Meet Eden; Contents of Visit to Mussolini Not Disclosed; U.S. Side Explains the Course of British-U.S. Negotiations</p>
<p>[London] In response to various questions in the House of Commons today regarding the Japanese military parade in the Shanghai Public Concession on December 3, British Foreign Secretary Eden said that the British and U.S. commanders in Shanghai had both informed the Japanese commander in advance that they did not approve of the parade and could not be responsible for any incidents that might occur as a result. Therefore, the British military did not assist the Japanese military parade in any way, but only maintained order. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, visited Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi after hearing about the proposed Japanese military parade and negotiated with him, believing that the move was provocative and unreasonable. (Cheers from the members of parliament.) The Japanese authorities must bear full responsibility for any incidents. The British government agreed to Sir Robert Clive's negotiation. It is true that the Japanese government has the right to station troops in the Public Concession, but the route of the Japanese military parade was outside the area designated for the Japanese military in the defense plan. The area where they paraded was peaceful and normal, so the parade was unnecessary. During the Japanese military parade, someone threw a bomb, injuring three Japanese soldiers, one Japanese civilian, one Indian police officer, and one Chinese police officer. Fortunately, none of the injuries were serious. The Chinese person who threw the bomb was shot and killed on the spot by the police. Mr. Eden said in conclusion, "I dare say that members of parliament will want me to take this opportunity to express my admiration for the Shanghai Public Concession Police Force's handling of the matter. In view of the serious crisis latent in this parade, the responsibilities borne by the police force were extremely heavy, and their various measures were exemplary." (6th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Paris] Japanese goodwill envoy Viscount Ishii arrived here today from Rome and is scheduled to depart for London tomorrow. He told a Reuters reporter that after arriving in London, he hoped to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden to discuss the Far Eastern situation. He also said that while in Rome, he met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The rumors that he was carrying a special mission were untrue. His trip to Europe was purely personal, but he would of course take the opportunity to discuss the Sino-Japanese conflict with European politicians. He discussed this issue with Mussolini, but they agreed that the content of the conversation should not be announced. As for Germany and Italy mediating the Far Eastern issue, he had not heard of it, but he hoped that a solution could be found soon. Japan would never implement any imperial plans, and there was no danger of pro-war factions wielding too much power. However, the communist crisis was very serious, and he feared that Soviet propaganda in Japan would be too excessive, leading the Japanese to a point of no return. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Japanese Privy Councilor Viscount Ishii arrived here from Paris today and will likely meet with key figures in the British political arena. Sir Robert Clive, the British Ambassador to Japan, recently visited Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota. Therefore, observers generally believe that Viscount Ishii's visit to England is related to this conversation. According to diplomatic sources, although the Japanese government has not yet decided on the exact terms for peace negotiations between China and Japan, it is prepared to accept them if the mediation is carried out purely by Britain.

<p>[London] According to information obtained by the Associated Press today, although Japan has been creating various threatening incidents in the Far East recently, the British authorities have decided not to take retaliatory measures against Japan until April of next year. By April of next year, Britain's rearmament plan will be completed, and Britain's naval power will exceed the combined forces of several other countries. At present, only a policy of appeasement towards Japan can be adopted to prevent Japan from interfering with the Hong Kong military authorities. Reports to the cabinet also stated that in the current state of affairs, it is difficult for Britain to take military action in the Far East because Britain must also consider the safety of Europe. (6th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] British Foreign Secretary Eden met with the U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in England on Friday, and there has been much speculation about it.

<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the meeting between Chinese Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and German Ambassador to China Trautmann, in which the German ambassador proposed mediation, a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared that Japan welcomes the mediation of the Sino-Japanese dispute by a third country based on a peaceful stance. However, Japan has not received notification of the results of this meeting. Japan has not proposed any peace terms. If China abandons its anti-Japanese policy and discusses the matter with an enlightened and fair attitude, Japan is willing to participate in these negotiations. (6th National Hai Tong Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Delivers Speech in Hankou</h3>
<p>If Japan Puts Forward Reasonable Conditions, We Can Also Consider Them</p>
<p>The Deeper the Understanding of National Humiliation, the Firmer the Determination to Avenge It</p>
<p>[Hankou] Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee of China and former President of the Executive Yuan, granted an interview to a representative of the Hai Tong News Agency today and declared in his speech that China has never sought war from the beginning, so the responsibility for launching a cessation of war does not lie with China. Regarding the question of whether Sino-Japanese understanding is possible, Mr. Wang strongly stated that China is willing to cooperate with Japan in principle, but resolutely opposes Japan's current demands. Friendship and cooperation between the two countries in the Far East was the goal of the policy pursued by Premier Sun Yat-sen, and China also deeply knows that sincere friendship between China and Japan is the main condition for the future welfare of the two countries. However, Japan's imperialist policy has made this friendship impossible to achieve. Japan launched a war against China, and China, because its national survival was threatened, rose up to resist. The sacrifices that both countries must therefore suffer were unnecessary, because China was willing to establish friendly relations with Japan. But now that the war has already begun, China can only continue the war to seek victory or to perish. The deeper Japan invades Chinese territory, the greater the danger Japan faces, because the deeper the Chinese people's understanding of national humiliation, the firmer their determination to avenge it. The Chinese government and the Chinese people are well aware that the stain on the nation's honor will lead to the disintegration of the entire country. Therefore, even if the future is unpredictable, China would rather reject Japan's current demands and continue to fight. Accepting Japan's current demands would be tantamount to surrendering to Japan, which would inevitably shame the country. But if Japan is truly willing to seek peace and puts forward acceptable conditions, China can also consider engaging in a ceasefire. The representative of the Hai Tong News Agency asked what would constitute "acceptable" conditions. Mr. Wang replied that it was impossible for him to enumerate the details at this time. General Chiang Kai-shek has repeatedly emphasized that the basis for negotiations can only be under the condition of "respecting China's sovereignty and independence."

<p>[New York] According to an announcement today by Mr. Harris, Vice President of the United States Lines, the company's mail ship Leviathan has been sold to British merchants for about 800,000 U.S. dollars and will be demolished. The Japanese wanted to bid to buy it, but the company refused, because we believe that today it is not even appropriate to consider bids from Japan. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[New York] The old mail ship "Leviathan" of the United American Lines has recently been purchased by a British shipping company for a price of $800,000.

<h3>British Dockworkers Boycott Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Union Issues Statement</p>
<p>[London] According to today's newspapers, dockworkers in Southampton refused to unload 200 tons of goods from Japan transported by the Princess Richelieu, which will cause diplomatic negotiations. It is heard that the Japanese Ambassador to the United Kingdom plans to protest this matter. This issue will also be debated in the House of Commons. The Central Executive Committee of the Transport and General Workers' Union will meet this afternoon to discuss this matter. Because political strikes are illegal in the United Kingdom, there is a strict ban, so it is believed that the committee will not support this strike and will also oppose the suggestion of using the same strike as a means to prevent the sale of Japanese goods in the United Kingdom. It is said that if this kind of strike expands, it will definitely affect Japan's business during the Christmas season, because most of the Christmas gifts here come from Japan. (6th Hai Tong Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] According to the General Federation of Transport Workers' Unions, the dockworkers' refusal to unload Japanese goods was automatic and had not been approved by the federation in advance. As for what attitude the federation will take if the boycott of Japanese goods expands, it is also unknown. (6th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan Demands the Soviet Union Expedite Fishing Treaty</h3>

Although the Soviet Union has its internal difficulties, according to the treaty, concluding a fisheries agreement with Japan should not present much difficulty for the Soviet Union. Japan now awaits a satisfactory response from Moscow. However, the spokesman declined to clarify whether Japan would be satisfied with the conclusion of a new agreement or the continuation of the existing arrangements, but in his view, there is little difference between the two.

<p>[Hong Kong] Hankow, 6th. Regarding the issue of a safety zone in Nanking, according to Hang Li-wu, who is in charge of this matter, the so-called safety zone is actually intended for the safety of ordinary civilians who cannot leave Nanking. Unfortunately, the Japanese side has not agreed. However, the foreign nationals remaining in Nanking are enthusiastically proceeding with plans to rename it a refugee zone. The area starts from Hsinchiehkou and extends to Shansi Road, expected to accommodate about 250,000 people. When I left Nanking on the 3rd, preparations for the organization within the zone were already complete. Commander Tang and Mayor Ma, who remained in Nanking, have provided much assistance to this matter, which is greatly appreciated by the foreign nationals remaining in Nanking. The Japanese side has also indirectly stated that they will abide by this refugee zone within their so-called possible scope, but the actual situation remains to be seen. (Special Dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>⊙Stockholm Regarding the matter of the Soviet Union's General Trade Union joining the International Federation of Trade Unions, an agreement has been reached after discussions between representatives of both parties in Moscow. It will take effect as soon as both parties approve it. Swedish newspapers are commenting on this matter, and heated debates have already erupted. The two major newspapers affiliated with the Liberal Party both stated that this move would link the Swedish General Trade Union with the Soviet trade union, which is extremely dangerous not only for Sweden but also for the Swedish Social Democratic Party, which has the General Trade Union as its cornerstone, and will also feel a serious impact. In short, the move to establish a united front by trade unions of various countries will only facilitate the propaganda movement of the Bolshevik faction. Although the newspapers affiliated with the Social Democratic Party express support for the cooperation between the International Federation of Trade Unions and the Soviet Union's General Trade Union, they attach several reservations. 'Social Democratic Newspaper' stated that it must be proved whether the Soviet Union's General Trade Union is a free labor group and conforms to the current situation in various democratic countries; otherwise, talk of cooperation is just empty words.

<h3>Italian Newspaper Publishes Secret Document</h3>

The document states that 'the current international political and naval situation is quite concerning. Italy has repeatedly dispatched troops to its North African territory of Libya and established naval and air force bases on Sicily, which has a significant impact on military strategy. In addition, Britain must ensure the freedom of navigation on the Atlantic and Mediterranean routes and therefore must occupy the Portuguese archipelago of Achaidos in the North Atlantic and the Palestinian region in the Mediterranean. Attention should be paid to this in the future.' (Havas, 6th)</p>

<h3>French Foreign Minister Expresses Thoughts on Visit to Poland</h3>
<p>Alliance Aims to Guarantee Security; Outcome of Talks Notified to Britain, Russia, and Other Countries; Delbos Continues Visit to Czech Authorities</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw Before departing for Kraków today, French Foreign Minister Delbos spoke to the press, expressing satisfaction with the meetings with Polish political figures and stating, 'After I accompanied Prime Minister Chautemps to London the other day and held talks with British political figures, I deeply felt the strong bond between Britain and France. Later, en route through Berlin, I was gratified that German Foreign Minister Neurath personally boarded the train to cordially discuss matters. My purpose in coming to Poland this time is none other than to closely connect with France's allied countries. However, this alliance of ours does not oppose any other country. But in the current world, we must be strong to prevail. Our alliance aims to guarantee security.' (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw Foreign Minister Beck hosted a luncheon today for French Foreign Minister Delbos. Delbos then visited the French Institute here in the afternoon and released a proclamation to the Polish people, recorded on a phonograph record, and then broadcast it on the radio tonight at 11:00 PM, saying, 'I bid farewell to the people of Warsaw, and I dare to sincerely tell you that my heart is filled with joy during this brief visit. I am deeply grateful for the generous treatment I received everywhere in your country, and I am honored to meet with your country's politicians and hear their voices. I dare say that the Polish people harbor friendly understanding and sincere expectations for France, which is completely consistent with the feelings of our government and people. Both France and Poland cherish security and love peace. From now on, we should continue to cooperate in the spirit of sincerity and friendship. The strength and lasting effectiveness of the Franco-Polish alliance lie in this.' General observers believe that Delbos's visit to Poland has made it easier to resolve various technical issues in culture and economics between France and Poland, and has greatly contributed to strengthening the Franco-Polish alliance. Delbos not only held multiple talks with Polish political figures but also toured Warsaw and its suburbs, getting in touch with the Polish people. Wherever he went, residents cheered along the way, demonstrating the deep friendship between France and Poland, which is not accidental. Delbos will travel to Kraków tonight and then to the Czech capital. En route, he will pass through the Hungarian capital, where Hungarian Foreign Minister Kanya may personally welcome him at the station. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw French Foreign Minister Delbos did not hold talks with Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck today, but only met with British Ambassador to Poland, Kennard, Soviet Chargé d'Affaires Vinogradov, Romanian Minister Şavulescu, Czech Minister Slavík, and Yugoslav Minister Guić to inform them of the situation of the Franco-Polish talks in recent days. In the evening, he attended a banquet at the French Embassy, to which most of the Polish government officials were invited to attend. Delbos is now scheduled to meet with Polish and foreign journalists tomorrow along with Colonel Beck to make a statement. They will have lunch together at noon and travel to Kraków Province together after the meal. They may take the opportunity to continue the talks. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw French Foreign Minister Delbos is scheduled to travel to Kraków with Foreign Minister Beck at 5:55 PM today. The two foreign ministers may hold talks in the car during the journey. They will not arrive in Kraków until midnight. Therefore, a joint communiqué from the two foreign ministers will not be issued before midnight. The full text of the communiqué will be very brief and will not contain any new factors. The political views of France and Poland differ somewhat. France adheres to the League of Nations, while Poland advocates resolving international issues through bilateral negotiations. However, under the pressure of current international events, all countries are striving to resolve all disputes based on the actual situation. Even if there are differences in viewpoints among countries, they are not irreconcilable. Moreover, there are no unresolved issues between France and Poland. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>⊙Warsaw Regarding the Franco-Polish talks, the French authorities here recently stated that Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck did not make a request to Foreign Minister Delbos for obtaining colonies. As for the fact that German Foreign Minister Neurath personally welcomed Delbos at the Berlin train station the other day, it was Neurath's own initiative. The rumor that it was instructed by the British side is not true. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the ongoing talks between France and Poland, the Paris Evening News correspondent in Warsaw recently stated that although the Polish government has not formally made a colonial request, the Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and French Foreign Minister Delbos will study this issue in detail during their talks. The Polish opposition newspapers are particularly adamant that Poland should also possess colonies. The correspondent also stated that, as far as Germany and Poland are concerned, if Europeans could continue to migrate to the Americas, these countries would not demand an outlet in Asia and Africa. Recently, the Polish government sent an inspection team to the French island of Madagascar in Africa to study whether it is possible for Polish people to migrate to the highlands of the island. The inspection team has now returned to Paris and will consult with the French government. In addition, Colonel Beck reportedly insisted during his meeting with Delbos yesterday that Poland must participate when Western European countries and Italy and Germany reach any solutions, and does not want to be confined to a corner of Eastern Europe. Poland's attitude is consistent with its firm opposition to the Four-Power Pact signed by Britain, France, Germany, and Italy in 1932, when it was not allowed to participate. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<h3>US Treasury Decides to Reduce Government Spending by $800 Million</h3>
<p>To Balance Next Year's Budget; Treasury Has Issued Two Types of Bonds</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Times Washington correspondent reports that U.S. government spending will be reduced by $800 million compared to last year's budget to achieve President Roosevelt's announced balanced budget for 1938-39. The Budget Bureau has already begun to work on the reductions. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The US Treasury Department has now issued ① bonds worth $250 million, with an annual interest rate of 2.5% and repayable in eight years; ② treasury bills worth $200 million, with an annual interest rate of 1.75% and repayable in five years. Holders of the $277.7 million in treasury bills maturing on February 1, 1938, can exchange them for the same amount of the above two types of new bonds. However, the new bonds exchanged are not for cash sale. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that the revenue from the new bonds will be used to repay the bonds that have already matured. He does not intend to raise new debt in the next two months. Treasury officials believe that the Treasurer's words confirm the authorities' intention to control spending and balance next year's budget within the current fiscal year. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>Lindbergh Couple Returns to the United States from England</h3>
<p>To Spend Christmas</p>
<p>[New York] The Lindbergh couple suddenly arrived here today. This is their first return to the country after residing in England two years ago. They arrived on the President Harding, keeping their movements very secret. They disembarked via the third-class passenger stairs. It is reported that their two sons are still in London.

After that, they often gathered with other passengers to chat and relax. Lindbergh refused to speak to news reporters, but according to crew members, the Lindbergh couple plans to spend Christmas with the grandmother at Eagle Rock in New Jersey, and plans to return to England after the holiday. A friend of Lindbergh in the United States recently received a letter from Lindbergh, saying that he plans to return to St. Louis soon. The Lindbergh couple secretly went to England with their children in 1935 out of fear that their second son would suffer the same fate as their eldest son, who was kidnapped. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>⊙Englewood, USA The famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh and his wife suddenly arrived here today aboard the President Harding after residing in England for two years due to rampant kidnappings in the United States. During the journey, Lindbergh kept a low profile, using the alias Greggory, and often wore black glasses. The Lindberghs have now gone to the private residence of Lindbergh's mother-in-law, Mrs. Morrow, where security is tight. The Lindberghs will probably spend the holidays there, and then return to England after the new year. Their two sons did not come with them. It is said that the Lindberghs may still settle in the United States in the future, but the timing is still uncertain. Even after arriving in the United States this time, they are avoiding seeing all outsiders. Mrs. Morrow's residence still does not acknowledge that the Lindberghs are guests there.

<p>[New York] Colonel Lindbergh's eldest son was kidnapped and murdered in 1932. Subsequently, a German named Hauptmann was charged as the main culprit in the case. After a thorough trial, he was executed in the electric chair. The case caused a sensation for a while. Later, there was an attempt to harm Lindbergh's second son, so Lindbergh took his family away from the United States and went to live in England. Now that the Lindbergh couple is returning to the country for a visit, a certain German-American group has brought up the old case again. On the one hand, they telegraphed New Jersey Governor Hoffman to stop continuing to pay the reward to the informant, because the real criminals have not been caught. On the other hand, they asked Lindbergh to generously donate money to help Hauptmann's wife, because after Hauptmann's death, his wife was too poor to make a living. (Reuters, 5th)</p>

<h3>Tanks and Aircraft Can Cover but Cannot Replace Infantry</h3>
<p>Conclusion of the US Army Annual Report</p>
<p>[Washington] US Army Chief of Staff General Craig stated in the 1937 annual report that the US Army Department advocates that tank units should cooperate closely with infantry. This view is quite reasonable based on observations of foreign wars. The wars in Spain and the Far East have shown that tanks and aircraft are valuable in covering infantry, but relying solely on tanks or aircraft cannot guarantee victory in land warfare. New weapons can assist infantry but cannot replace infantry. (Reuters, 6th)</p>

<h3>First Joint Memorial Week Since the Central Government Moved to Chongqing</h3>
<p>Chairman Lin's Speech on the Spirit of Jointly Overcoming National Crisis</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Chongqing, 6th – The Kuomintang Central Party Headquarters held its first joint expanded memorial week after relocating to Chongqing at the Fan Zhuang open-air training ground at 9:00 AM on the 6th. Central and local government officials, as well as school principals, attended. Following ceremonial procedures led by Chairman Lin, he delivered a report, the original text of which is as follows: "Today is the first joint memorial week since the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government moved to Chongqing. I have many thoughts, so I take this opportunity to say a few words to everyone. The current national crisis can be said to be extremely serious. The battles across the country, in the north in Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, Henan, Shandong, and in the south in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, are all extremely fierce. At the same time, inland provinces are also under the threat of Japanese aircraft and bombs. The breadth of the war zone and the intensity of the fighting are unprecedented in our country's history. In this serious period, to resist Japanese aggression and preserve the integrity of our territory, the only way is for the entire nation to unite and engage in a long-term resistance. There is a path to survival. There is no better plan. In the past few months, the number of soldiers on the front lines who have sacrificed themselves for righteousness is countless. Their spirit and integrity are truly moving and awe-inspiring. Why do they risk their lives like that? It is because the Japanese want to destroy our country, taking every inch. Without resistance, there is no way to save the nation. Rather than sitting and waiting for death, being at the mercy of others, it is better to strive and seek survival, to 'trade sacrifice for price,' that is the meaning. Consider Shao Kang in ancient times, with a small army and a small plot of land, was able to restore the Xia dynasty. Goujian tasted bitterness, gathered strength for ten years, and trained for ten years, eventually destroying the State of Wu. Consider foreign examples: during the war between Russia and France, the Russian government retreated to Kamchatka. Although its capital was ravaged, it was able to strive for strength and become a world power. When Turkey fought Greece, it also moved its capital to Ankara, suffering great sacrifices, but later worked hard to revive and become an independent nation. Judging from these precedents, any country, no matter what difficulties and obstacles it encounters, if it can maintain the spirit of enduring hardship, and the entire nation works together, not being arrogant in victory, not discouraged in defeat, persevering with unwavering determination, the country can be revived, and the nation can survive. The government has moved to Chongqing to work in order to adapt to the war situation, coordinate the overall situation, and facilitate long-term resistance. It has the greatest determination. Almost all the staff of the central government agencies have arrived one after another. At this critical and tense time, the soldiers on the front lines are fighting together, making persistent efforts. We civil servants in the rear are comparatively comfortable, but our current duties are more urgent than usual, and our responsibilities are greater than usual. We should do our best, endure hardship, step up our work, and increase administrative efficiency to serve as the backing for the soldiers on the front lines. Only then can we be worthy of the country, the soldiers, and the people. This is what I hope everyone will pay attention to. As for personal morality, one should also exercise self-discipline, cherish time, not waste it on pleasure, not engage in unnecessary social activities, preserving precious energy for useful purposes. One should be careful in every action, and be especially frugal with financial and material resources, accumulating them to strengthen the power of resistance. Only in this way can we be considered dutiful and be a model for the people. The above are the points that all comrades from Nanjing should pay attention to. In addition, I also have a few words of encouragement for the civil servants of the local agencies. I would like to say them incidentally. Since arriving in Chongqing, I have seen the progress of local construction, the hard work of government agencies, and the passionate spirit of the general public. It is truly rare, and I am very gratified. However, at this critical moment for the survival of the nation, since we are determined to resist to the end, we still hope that local agencies will lead the people to continue to work hard, officials at all levels will adhere to their duties, and everyone will do their best, with internal and external support, united as one. Then, we can better demonstrate the spirit of jointly overcoming national crisis, and the final victory will naturally be assured. This is what I most hope for." (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<h3>Situation in Various Places</h3>
<p>Danyang: The Danyang Fellow Villagers Association recently received a letter from a person dispatched by the association from Tongzhou, stating that when he returned to Danyang city last month, he encountered an air raid. Zhongshi Street, Jiang Hengchang, South Grass Lane, Hongyun Building, Zhongzheng Bridge, Baota Lane, and the Jiang residence were all hit by incendiary bombs, causing a large fire that spread from west of Xian Bridge to Xiaodongmen Bridge, Dongmen Huo Lane to Xieqiao Guandi Riverbank, and Nanqiao Dongheyan to Banqiao Hou Street Baiyun Street North Grass Lane Zhong Grass Lane, burning for four days and not completely extinguished. On the first of this month, the left and right sides of the new North Gate (Zhongzheng Gate) were again bombed by Japanese planes with more than a dozen bombs, causing the entire city to become scorched earth. All refugees have been evacuated to the countryside by local charities. The situation is very tragic, so he painfully left his hometown on the 2nd, transiting to Hankou, etc. After receiving the above news, the association received reports from Mr. Yu and others who had fled from Danyang to Shanghai, with similar situations.</p>
<p>Shuanglin: The Shuanglin Fellow Villagers Correspondence Office sent someone to the village on the 28th of last month to investigate the news. Of the three people who went together, only Mr. Chen risked his life to arrive in Shuanglin on November 1st. Yesterday (the 6th), he led more than a dozen fellow villagers from Ningbo to Shanghai on the De Ping Lun. According to reports, Shuanglin fell on November 21st, with about thirty or forty people killed or injured in the town. Local officials were said to have fled to the countryside. Upper and lower Heng Street and the area around the North Fence were mostly burned down. Although the South Fence and East Fence were looted, the houses were preserved. What can be comforting to fellow villagers is that Shuanglin and the surrounding villages have not suffered from the war, and most fellow villagers are safely avoiding in the countryside. Japanese troops come to the countryside about four or five times a day, but do not station themselves. It is also learned that the office plans to send staff to Shuanglin again within days to serve fellow villagers.</p>
<p>Pinghu: Yesterday (the 6th), someone from Pinghu came to Shanghai and talked about the situation there. Pinghu suddenly became tense after the Japanese troops landed at Jinshanwei. Subsequently, our army and the Japanese army came into contact at the Six Li Bridge and other places about five or six li outside the East Gate of the city. The sound of gunfire was incessant day and night, and the fighting was fierce. Now, most of the houses in the busiest areas from the East Gate to the West Gate in Pinghu city have been burned down, almost becoming a scorched earth. Many places inside and outside the South Gate have also been burned down. Only the area around the North Gate, where the market was usually deserted, has one or two houses destroyed, and the rest are intact. Among the shops inside and outside the city walls, there are still some that have not been burned down, but no one has opened for business yet, and the residents have also evacuated, a scene of extreme desolation. The situation in the villages and towns in the four rural areas is still peaceful, and many people have moved there, but bandits are active, and most have been robbed.</p>
<h3>Fei Shu and the Japanese Side Discuss the Hangzhou Refugee Zone</h3>
<p>Dr. Fei Shu, former president of Zhejiang Zhijiang University, recently traveled to Shanghai from Hangzhou to discuss the Hangzhou safety zone with the Japanese side. The location of the zone is in the Xizi Lake New Market scenic area. It is said that the Japanese spokesperson stated that they must first obtain the attitude of our government before expressing their views. Currently, the U.S. Consul in Shanghai, Gauss, and many foreigners are actively engaged, and formal negotiations will be held soon. (Huadong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Huaiyin People's Thrift Movement</h3>
<p>A thrift movement meeting was held in Qingjiangpu to expand publicity and awaken citizens to engage in thrift.</p>
<h3>Our Planes Flew to Fushan Port and Destroyed Two Japanese Warships</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Fortress Sunk Eight Japanese Warships One After Another; Japanese Troops Attempted to Land at Zhanghuang Port But Failed</p>
<p>A Nantong dispatch stated that on the 2nd, more than 30 Japanese warships were anchored in the Langfu crossing, and one was anchored in the Tiansheng Port River, with no action taken towards the north bank. At 9:30 AM on the 2nd, six of our planes flew to Fushan Port and dropped bombs on the Japanese warships in the river. Seven explosions were heard, reportedly destroying two Japanese warships. Our planes then flew southwest.</p>
<p>In the Jiangyin area, at about 10:00 AM on the 1st, the fortress's artillery battery sank three Japanese warships. The fortress remains intact. From 3:00 PM that afternoon, the sound of artillery fire became even more intense, especially at midnight. The houses in Nantong city were also shaken. Also, before Jiangyin fell, seven Japanese warships, before the fortress was blockaded, were fired upon by the fortress's artillery battery, sinking five of them. On the 4th, a traveler from Jingjiang to Nantong reported that he had personally witnessed the sinking of the Japanese warships. Nantong city has not heard the sound of artillery fire since 5:00 PM on the 3rd. The telegraph and telephone between Jiangyin and Nantong have been cut off since November 27th.</p>
<p>It is widely rumored in Jingjiang, across the river from Jiangyin, that Japanese troops landed on the 2nd. After inquiring with Jingjiang via long-distance telephone, it was learned that this was not true. Jingjiang is still guarded by our troops, and reinforcements have been added. However, inside and outside the city, due to the intense artillery battles in the Jiangyin area, the houses were shaken, and the cups and plates on the tables rattled. Merchants and residents have all evacuated. At about 4:00 PM on the evening of the 3rd, three Japanese warships, near Longjusha outside Zhanghuang Port, at the junction of Rugao and Jingjiang, launched small motorboats carrying two or three hundred people, attempting to land. They were fired upon by the troops stationed on the north bank and swept with machine guns, failing to succeed. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Zhoupu Situation is Chaotic</h3>
<p>Japanese troops once came and then withdrew; no one has come forward to organize a maintenance association</p>
<p>A reporter encountered refugees from Zhoupu Town in Pudong who had fled to Shanghai yesterday afternoon, and they described the current situation in Zhoupu. According to them, the security in Zhoupu has been very chaotic recently, and no one is taking care of the order in the town. Previously, the Japanese side had ordered Wang Pixian to organize a maintenance association for Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha counties, and set up a joint office in Zhoupu Taojia Street. Wang declared himself the chairman of the maintenance association for the three counties, but he was dissatisfied with Gong and Tao and local gentry, leading to internal strife and mutual killings. Now the organization of the maintenance association has been suspended. Upon hearing the news, the Japanese side dispatched 150 naval infantrymen to Zhoupu on the 3rd to suppress the situation, but they withdrew on their own that evening, only planting Japanese flags at the main intersections of the streets. The rumor that more than 500 Japanese soldiers were stationed in Zhoupu is a misunderstanding. Currently, no one dares to come forward to organize a maintenance association.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Passenger Transport Unobstructed</h3>
<p>Travelers to Tongzhou are still crowded; the Zhejiang will sail to Tongzhou today</p>
<p>Although Jiangyin has fallen, the various ports along the Yangtze River above Jiangyin to Shanghai are still accessible, only requiring a slight detour. Therefore, foreign shipping companies are operating the Shanghai-Tongzhou route as usual. According to inquiries with the shipping industry this morning, the important towns along the Yangtze River above Jiangyin include Zhenjiang. To go from Shanghai to Zhenjiang, one can take a ship sailing to Tongzhou, disembark at Tiansheng Port, and from Tiansheng Port to Tangjia Zha in Tongzhou, there is only a ten-mile land journey. There, you can take a small inland river boat to Taizhou, about 260 li of water journey (requiring 24 hours). From Taizhou to Xiannv Miao, there is also a land journey of about 60 li. From Xiannv Miao to Liuwei, which belongs to Yangzhou County, there is only a land journey of 13 li. Crossing the river from Liuwei is Zhenjiang. Therefore, for the other ports, knowing this, you will know that they are all accessible. However, cargo transportation is quite inconvenient, but passenger travel is not hindered.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the ships operating the Shanghai-Tongzhou route were originally the Taikoo's Wuhu and Wuxue, and Jardine Matheson's Tonghe, Pinghe, and other four ships. Due to the accumulation of goods waiting for transshipment in Tongzhou, the ships temporarily stopped loading goods and only carried passengers. Passengers are still crowded. Now Taikoo has decided to send the Zhejiang wheel again, scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Tongzhou at 7:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>The Xiushan Wheel Decided to Stop Sailing from Shanghai to Chongming</h3>
<p>The Ma Le Wheel Continues to Sail to Ruifengsha</p>
<p>After the British Taikoo Steamship Company planned to open the Shanghai-Chongming route, it sent the Xiushan wheel to sail from Shanghai to Chongming at 7:00 AM on the 4th of this month. When the ship was about to arrive at Chongming, a misunderstanding occurred with the garrison, and it was shot at, the shipowner was seriously injured and died, and immediately returned to Shanghai, temporarily berthed at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession. The company decided yesterday to stop sailing the Shanghai-Chongming line, and all passengers who had purchased tickets were refunded at the original price, and the truth of the misunderstanding was investigated. After the British Ma Le Wheel sailed on the Ruifengsha route, it was decided to continue sailing on the second voyage today, scheduled to depart from Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning. Passengers who are going to Chongming Nanmen Port, Baozhen, Qixiao, Xinkaihe and other places can take the wheel and transfer, and can reach the destination on the same day. The ticket office is located at Defeng Company, No. 41 Pudong Bank Building, San Mao Ge Bridge.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Merchants in Shanghai Discuss Cargo Transportation between Shanghai and Sichuan</h3>
<p>All Cargo Transportation Between Shanghai and Sichuan Has Been Completely Suspended Since the War</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, cargo transportation between this city and various places has suddenly become difficult, and it is still difficult to recover. According to a leader of the Sichuan business community in Shanghai, cargo transportation between Shanghai and Sichuan relies entirely on the Yangtze River route. Due to the long distance, it usually takes ten days for cargo to be transported between the two places. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the Jiangyin line has been blockaded, and only foreign ships have been relied upon to maintain a tenuous connection. Later, foreign ships only went as far as Tongzhou, relying on land transportation in between. Cargo transportation between Shanghai and Sichuan has been completely suspended, causing great losses to commerce in both places. According to reports, most of the goods transported from Sichuan to Shanghai are medicinal materials, while Shanghai mainly supplies cloth and various manufactured daily necessities. Sichuan Province has a vast territory and a large population, and is a major outlet for products from manufacturers in Shanghai. Now, it has been completely cut off. However, Sichuan Province is now the seat of the National Government, and personnel are increasing daily. It is expected that some industries will gradually rise. As for Sichuanese people engaged in industry and commerce in Shanghai, in the current environment, they are naturally facing the same difficulties as the general industrial and commercial community, but they are even more profound.</p>
<h3>Detailed Continued Account of the Buildings Burned Down in Nanshi</h3>
<p>The Ancient Temple of Haichao Has Been Completely Destroyed; The China Merchants Electric Company is Safe</p>
<p>The fire in Nanshi, south of Dongjiadu at Laiyi Wharf on Limalu, through Santai Wharf inside, and the houses in the Qinglong Bridge area that were burned were mostly those along the outside, and the damage was not much, but there were also dozens of houses destroyed. Facing south to Sanjiao Street, the Xuejiabang pigsty and slaughterhouse were bombed. The buildings along Limalu in Sanjiao Street, starting from Datongchang South Goods Store, through Li Zhengfeng Department Store, Sanyangrun South Goods Store, Zhou Qiaoxing Noodle Restaurant, Feng Tianbao Pharmacy, across the Malu Bridge, to the buildings near the Shanghai Barracks, and the entire Ririshengli were destroyed. The houses in the back, such as Ping An Bridge and Meijili, were also destroyed. The buildings along Huntang Bridge and Taianli (formerly Baotingli) were completely destroyed. The sixty houses in the Wangjiazhai Dongxingli on Nanjing Street (owned by Zhu Liangcai of the Nanqu Fire Brigade) were completely destroyed. Dozens of houses in the Darangli of the Shanghai Barracks were also completely destroyed. The Dachangli in Nanmatou (owned by Wang Yiting) was also completely destroyed. The houses in Qin Xianli and Xin Xianli of the Shanghai Barracks were also completely destroyed. The more than thirty newly built houses in Lanzhili, owned by Wang Daosheng on the opposite side, were also completely destroyed.</p>
<p>The Gu Surname Property on Dong Guohuo Road: More than twenty houses in the alley were completely destroyed. More than one hundred houses in Sanminfang on Puyudong Road were completely destroyed. Part of the houses in Xin Lucun (formerly the Old Bookstore Company) in Lujiazham were completely destroyed. Ningxiali was completely destroyed. The famous Haichao Temple (also known as Liuyun Lanjun) in Shanghai, including the Buddhist hall, monks' rooms, scripture library, and the Liuyun School behind it, with more than two hundred houses, was also completely burned down a week ago. It took more than fifty years for the first abbot, Guanyue, to raise funds to build this magnificent temple. Later, after obtaining the Buddhist scriptures, it became a famous Buddhist monastery in Shanghai. The plaque of Liuyun Lanjun was written by Wei Guangtao, the former Governor-General of Liangjiang during the Qing Dynasty. It was most prosperous under the second abbot, Yingqian. Under the third abbot, Dehao, in recent years, Dehao handed over the temple's authority to his disciples. After the fall of Nanshi, there were fires everywhere, but this temple was able to maintain its original state, and only the abbot fled. The accounting monks and various responsible monks and incense keepers were also well treated by the Japanese officers. Unexpectedly, it was burned down on the night of the 27th of last month. According to the abbot's guess, the reason was that the rear row of houses in the temple had been used to station troops during several civil wars. There may have been</p>
<p>ammunition left behind. But after the troops left at that time, the rear row of houses was sealed off. The temple had a total of thirteen rows of houses, and all the Buddha statues, antiques, scriptures, paintings, and movable and immovable property were lost, totaling more than one million yuan. Now only one row of firewood rooms remains, and the entire temple is abandoned. Therefore, Monk Dehao borrowed 10,000 yuan a few days ago and dismissed all the incense keepers. After passing Haichao Temple, Qingxin Boys' Middle School was destroyed, but the Girls' Middle School was preserved.</p>
<p>The South Railway Station was completely destroyed. The houses of Chenjiaqiao and Sanshan Guild Hall were also completely destroyed. The Nanqu Fire Brigade was bombed out. However, the Qiuxin Factory and Jiuji Wood Shop on Jichang Street, as well as the Water Company and China Merchants Tram Company, were all preserved. As for the Xieshao area, the Hui Ning Guild Hall and Shaoxing Guild Hall were completely destroyed, and more than a thousand coffins were burned. From the Yun Guan section of Fangxie Road, and the former site of the City Party Headquarters, which was later converted into the Health Bureau Hospital, were completely destroyed, as well as the houses on both sides. More than two hundred houses on Xilin Road, Linying Road, and Dalin Road were destroyed. In Caohijing Town, only three or four houses were destroyed. In addition, there were also small streets that were burned.</p>
<h3>The Refugee Resettlement Association Sends Personnel to Jiangxi to Investigate Soil Quality</h3>
<p>The First Batch of One Thousand People Will Set Off Soon; Additional Standing Committee Members Selected to Handle Relief</p>
<p>The Refugee Resettlement Association in the War Zone recently received a telegram from the Jiangxi Provincial Government welcoming refugees to reclaim wasteland. It has sent the director of the investigation department, Zhang Tongsheng, to Jiangxi to investigate soil quality and contact the Jiangxi Provincial authorities. In order to increase strength, concentrate relief, and change from passive shelter to active production, the association added Xiong Xiling, Zhao Jinqing, Baker, Lin Kanghou, Xie Jiaqian, Lu Bohong, Lu Ganchen, Sun Ruihuang, Wen Lanting and others as Standing Committee members at the Second Plenary Meeting, and nominated Hu Yongqi, Chen Yisheng and Li Guiyong as executive secretaries of the association. The first batch of one thousand people will set off soon.</p>
<h3>The Industry Strictly Abides by the Measures for Stabilizing Finance</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Shanghai war, after the Ministry of Finance announced the measures for stabilizing finance, in order to supervise the operations of various banks, it ordered the Banking Association to inform all banks to prepare a report form of receipts and payments in accordance with the provisions of the measures for stabilizing finance, and report it to the Ministry of Finance on a daily basis for examination. According to inquiries with the financial community, the financial situation in Shanghai has been quite stable since the implementation of the measures for stabilizing finance for three months. The operations of various banks are also cautious and steady, and they can strictly abide by the measures for stabilizing finance. Since the change in the Shanghai war, the banks have adhered to the measures and continued their business without changing their original intentions. Therefore, the banks no longer prepare daily reports of receipts and payments and submit them to the Ministry of Finance for review.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation in Ganpu is Peaceful</h3>
<p>The person who fled from Ganpu to Shanghai spoke</p>
<p>According to the person who fled from Ganpu to Shanghai yesterday, he left Ganpu on the 29th of last month. In the half-month before he left the place, the place was extremely peaceful, but very few residents remained. He took the route through Hangzhou, crossed the Qiantang River and transferred to Ningbo to Shanghai. When he passed through Hangzhou, it was like walking on a deserted island. There was no business or market to speak of, and there were very few traces of people. It was simply a deserted city, and the scene was extremely desolate. Although Ganpu is an important coastal area, according to his personal experience, no war has occurred. The people of Ganpu in Shanghai can rest assured.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Entering the British Defense Zone Must First Notify the British Authorities</h3>
<p>The British side has notified the Japanese authorities</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the British authorities in Shanghai notified the Japanese military authorities yesterday (the 5th) that in the future, if the Japanese military authorities intend to send armed soldiers into the British defense zone, they must notify the British authorities in advance. According to reliable sources last night, this notification was a routine procedure and was not officially delivered to the Japanese military authorities. Yesterday, small teams of Japanese soldiers were found twice entering the British defense zone in the Western District, and were stopped and questioned by British soldiers on defense. In the morning, three mounted military policemen were stopped by British soldiers at the obstacles near the Jessfield Bridge. After consultation, they were allowed to pass. The three said they were going to a yarn factory in the Italian defense zone. There was a senior British officer present at the time. At the same time, about twelve Japanese soldiers were stopped by British sentries on Yu Yuan Road and were also allowed to pass. The officer accompanying the soldiers also said that he intended to go to a warehouse in the Italian defense zone. According to a report from an officer in the Merchant Corps, he saw the team of Japanese soldiers at the corner of Jessfield Road and a certain road. The Chinese people there were shocked when they saw the Japanese soldiers suddenly arrive with pistols in their hands.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Government Cables Approval for Purchasing Food from Eastern Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Second Batch of Foreign Rice Loaded onto the "Marguerite" Vessel for Shipment  Rice Shops Have Resumed Business, Association Thoroughly Investigating Missing Rice Case</p>
<p>For the sake of regulating the food supply for Shanghai citizens, the Miscellaneous Grains Industry, with the approval of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, has ordered a second batch of 26,000 bags of foreign rice from abroad.  These are loaded on the "Marguerite" vessel, expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 12th.  After the rice shops receive the foreign rice, they will resume retail sales. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province Approves Food Purchase</p>
<p>Members of the Miscellaneous Grains Industry Association, including rice shops Wanxingyu and Rendada, have been purchasing domestic food from Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, Taixian, and Dongtai in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.  Yesterday, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce forwarded a telegram from Zhu Jiahua, Chairman of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, stating that, "The lack of food and provisions in Shanghai is causing the people great suffering.  Rice, wheat, vegetables, fruits, and miscellaneous grains can be purchased from the three prefectures of Wen, Tai, and Ning in this province.  Please organize groups to handle this, and we will notify the commissioners and magistrates of the relevant areas to provide all possible assistance."  It is reported that the Chamber of Commerce has sent circulars to related industries to discuss implementation.</p>
<p>Second Batch of Foreign Rice Already Shipped</p>
<p>Yongda Company ordered 80,000 bags of foreign rice from abroad. The first batch of 20,000 bags has already arrived in Shanghai on the "Shunzhi" vessel. The second batch of 26,000 bags has been loaded onto the British vessel "Marguerite" and has set sail, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th of this month.  The third batch of 20,000 bags is scheduled to arrive on the 18th of this month.  Furthermore, the French company Daifu, entrusted by various factories and individuals, has ordered approximately 5,000 bags of foreign rice in total, which have been loaded onto the French postal company's vessel "Lili," scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 13th of this month.</p>
<p>"Shunzhi" Unloads Cargo and Distributes Rice</p>
<p>The "Shunzhi" vessel docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf on the Bund outside the French Concession yesterday morning. Yongda Rice Company sent personnel to begin unloading the cargo. The rice bags are marked with the words "Hengfeng Rice Company, Annam White Rice." The Rice Shop Association dispatched trucks to transport the rice to 200 companies, including Wanchang, in the French Concession, with 40 bags per company, totaling 8,000 bags. Each truck was accompanied by a French police officer for protection. The retail price is set at 8.5 cents per catty, with a maximum limit of one yuan per household.</p>
<p>Rice Shops Resume Business and Retail Sales</p>
<p>The fourth batch of 30,000 bags of foreign rice, jointly purchased by the Public Concession's Bureau of Works and the South China Rice Company and loaded on the "Zhejiang" vessel, has now been completely unloaded after arriving in Shanghai. The 500 rice shops in the two concessions have each received 40 bags and have resumed retail sales. However, buyers are still crowded, and detectives are maintaining order and selling in sequence.</p>
<p>Association Thoroughly Investigating Missing Rice Case</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from rice industry groups that regarding the missing 40 bags of Saigon rice, which is suspected of involving corruption, the First Special District Court is investigating according to law. The Rice Shop Association entrusted Yichang Automobile Company to handle rice transportation. Liu Longxiang, Zhou Guangcheng, Deng Fucheng, and others are all automobile foremen who transport rice and are not association staff. The association has held the automobile company responsible for the missing 40 bags of rice from Xincheng Rice Company and has requested the French company Daifu to re-inspect the rice stored in the warehouse in order to uncover the truth.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Refugee Camp Facilities</h3>
<p>Mail Service Restored in Refugee Camp</p>
<p>Mail delivery within the Nanshi Refugee Camp has recently been restored. Residents and refugees can drop letters into mailboxes for delivery. Incoming mail is delivered by postmen in two shifts, morning and afternoon. Refugees who have difficulty writing letters due to illiteracy are assisted by the document section heads of each district.  Therefore, it is said to be convenient.</p>
<p>Red and White Symbols for Identification</p>
<p>To facilitate easy identification and management of residents and refugees in the refugee camp, two types of symbols, red and white, have recently been distributed.  All original residents within the district wear red symbols, while refugees wear white symbols. Refugees are not allowed to go out without a reason, so there is no noise in the streets and alleys. Especially in the area around the City God Temple under the management of the Red Swastika Society, the streets are clean and orderly, giving people the feeling that this is not a refugee camp.</p>
<p>More Shelters to Be Added in the Camp</p>
<p>Some shops in the camp have now reopened. The International Relief Committee also plans to set up a coal briquette shop in each of the nine districts to supply residents in the camp. In addition, the average number of people entering the refugee camp from the French Concession every day is over 300, so the number of people in the camp is gradually increasing, and the existing shelters are overcrowded. Therefore, the committee decided to add shelters to accommodate them. As for the number of deaths in the camp, it has decreased since food was provided and nutrition has improved. Recently, the China Child Welfare Association established a children's hospital at 9 Anren Street.</p>
<p>Building Wooden Fences for Safety</p>
<p>In addition to the police dispatched by the French authorities to maintain order in the camp, the relief committee's office in the camp has recently established a patrol team, divided into three shifts of four people each, to patrol each district and protect residents. To further ensure safety, it is also planned to build wooden fences at the street entrances around the refugee camp and at important junctions in the nine districts, following the method used in the city thirty years ago, to protect them. After the wooden fences are installed, they will be opened and closed on time according to the current night-time alert measures.</p>
<p>China Jiji Society Provides Tea</p>
<p>The China Jiji Society has set up free stoves in the refugee camp to facilitate tea for the shelters. ⑴ The locations are temporarily set up in two places, one in Yuyuan Biejing and one on Wenchang Road. ⑵ Shelter water supply time: 7:30 AM to 10:00 AM, 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. ⑶ Resident tea time: 10:30 AM to 2:00 PM. The money earned will be handed over to the International Relief Committee for charity. ⑷ Shelter water use obligations: each shelter sends workers to take turns going back and forth, carrying cold and hot water.</p>
<p>Disaster Children's Shelter Moved Yesterday</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association, because the disaster children's shelter established on Datong Road and Baker Road was narrow and difficult to expand, has selected St. John's YMCA in Caojiadu as the new location. It has been actively arranging it for days and is now ready. It is reported that the association began moving yesterday and is expected to complete the move in about three days. A portion of the disaster children in the refugee camp can also be expected to move in within a short period of time. The new location can accommodate more than 1,000 people, and the internal equipment is even more complete. As for the association's dispatch of personnel to the Pinghan Railway to relieve disaster children, a concrete plan was also discussed and decided at yesterday's board meeting.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Arrest Four Guests at the Datong Hotel</h3>
<p>Taken to Japanese Military Headquarters for Questioning Released After About an Hour Bureau of Works Protests to Senior Consul</p>
<p>Regarding the fact that armed Japanese soldiers entered the Datong Hotel and arrested several Chinese residents for questioning, the chief of the Bureau of Works Police Department has reported to the bureau. It is reported that the bureau has given urgent consideration to the matter in its entirety and has immediately submitted a letter of protest to the Senior Consul.</p>
<p>Directly Entering the Datong</p>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that before 6:00 AM this morning (the 6th), two cars carrying police from the Japanese Consulate drove across the Garden Bridge and parked in front of the Datong Hotel on Nanjing Road. They entered the hotel and arrested four Chinese guests, including one woman, and escorted them to the Japanese military headquarters in Hongkou. At that time, the manager of the Datong Hotel telephoned the Old Zhabei Police Station, but it was too late to prevent it. Twelve Japanese, some in uniform and some in plain clothes, armed with rifles and pistols, rushed into the hotel without encountering any resistance and went straight to rooms 309 and 310.</p>
<p>Arresting Four Guests</p>
<p>Inside was the office of the Yang Ji (transliteration) Silk Company. Mr. Yang, Mr. Huang, another man, and a woman were arrested and put into a car, which sped along Nanjing Road and across the Garden Bridge into Hongkou. Even when the red traffic lights occasionally turned on, they ignored them and drove straight through. After being briefly questioned at the Japanese military headquarters, the four were released after an hour. Whether this action by the Japanese was due to mistaken arrest or to show that the Japanese can act independently and freely in the Public Concession at any time remains to be determined after the police investigate.</p>
<p>Police Investigation</p>
<p>The Old Zhabei Police Station is currently investigating this case and has summoned the four to the police station for questioning. The Deputy Chief Inspector of the Bureau of Works Police Department, Mr. Aflus, only learned of this matter from the report of the Datong Hotel. No other information was obtained. It is noted that the Datong Hotel is affiliated with the Wing On Company, which is registered in Hong Kong. It is also noted that after the Nanjing Road bombing incident, the Japanese authorities made four demands to Chief Inspector Jurad.</p>
<p>Foreign Attention</p>
<p>The first item was that the Japanese military should be allowed to pass through the Public Concession at any time without prior notice to the Bureau of Works. The fourth item was that in order to assist the Bureau of Works in maintaining the security of the Public Concession, the Japanese military should be allowed to take independent action within the concession when deemed necessary, to investigate and interrogate suspects, and other actions. These demands were not accepted by Mr. Jurad. He only replied to the Japanese authorities that the letter had been read and forwarded to his superiors for review. Nothing further was heard after that. Since the Datong Hotel case this morning, foreign observers have recalled these demands.</p>
<p>Rushing Cars</p>
<p>After 9:00 AM this morning, three cars carrying Japanese sped eastward on Nanjing Road, ignoring the red traffic lights along the way. In the first car, three or four Japanese stood on the pedals, and the sound of the horn was constantly blaring. The police officers directing traffic were forced to quickly stop the vehicles on the cross streets to avoid causing an accident. According to foreigners walking on Nanjing Road, the passengers in the first car appeared to be Japanese consular police officers.</p>
<h3>Taichi Diagram Paper Flags Confiscated</h3>
<p>The "North China Herald" reported that yesterday (the 5th), a Chinese person was distributing a bundle of paper flags to rickshaw pullers in Pudong when he was arrested by the police. The flag was yellow with a red and green Taichi diagram. It was said that the flags were used by farmers in Pudong to express their friendship to the Japanese army stationed there. More than a dozen flags carried by the Chinese person were confiscated.</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reported that at 11:00 AM yesterday, many men and women were parading in teams, holding yellow Taichi diagram small flags in the area of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Joffre. The concession authorities dispersed them immediately because they were obstructing public order. It is said that this kind of flag has also been found in the western part of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Takahashi Line Adds Ferry Boats to Transport Passengers</h3>
<p>Increased Number of Ferries Operating</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Takahashi Line, the traffic across the Huangpu River has been very congested. Even villagers from as far away as Songjiang, Jinshan, and Pinghu are detouring to Takahashi Town in Pudong to take the ferry to Shanghai because the land and water transportation in Nanshi and southern Huangpu are blocked. As for those returning to their hometowns from Shanghai, this is also their only route. Because each ferry was insufficient to carry the passengers, the British company Maller Company's "Diana" and the German company Richwo Company's "New Jiangnan" were added to run an additional shift yesterday. Each day, they traveled between Takahashi and Shanghai three times. It is estimated that the total number of passengers carried yesterday reached 15,000. A large batch of vegetables from Pudong has also been transported, so vegetable prices in the city will gradually decline.</p>
<h3>An 84-Year-Old Woman Survives the War</h3>
<p>Hidden for 101 Days  She and Three Others Unharmed</p>
<p>The "North China Herald" reported that there are still Chinese people hiding in the back streets and alleys of Hongkou, preferring to starve or die of illness rather than be seen by Japanese soldiers. Last Saturday and Sunday, Public Concession police found four such Chinese people in a house in a vegetable market street near Broadway Road, some seriously ill and some starving. There were a total of five people in the family. One was wounded by stray bullets on August 29 and died after five days. The family secretly moved his body to a neighboring empty house at night. When the police found it on Saturday and Sunday, only white bones remained. Of the four survivors, one was an 84-year-old woman, and the others were two men and a child. The old woman and others hid for 101 days, relying on a small amount of rice to survive. What was even more difficult was the lack of water. They stored water when it rained to cope with the emergency. It is noted that in late August, many Chinese civilians were shot and killed on Vegetable Market Street. The police found about 200 bodies. This old woman, two men, and a child managed to escape death and were rescued by the police on Saturday and Sunday. It can be said that they survived the tiger's mouth. The four are now being treated by doctors. In recent weeks, other survivors have been found in the Eastern District. Because of poor diet, many suffer from beri-beri and are dying. In addition, many Chinese corpses have been found starved to death, especially in the Dongjiaxing Road area.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society's Relief Work</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society has a long history of relief work. After the Lugouqiao Incident in early July of this year, the society began to prepare for all aspects of relief. From the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13 to the withdrawal of our troops from Shanghai on November 11, the society rescued more than 400 wounded soldiers and more than 1,000 wounded civilians, who were transported to various rescue hospitals for treatment. After the establishment of the refugee camp planned by the Shanghai International Relief Committee, the society sent Mr. Yang Yanniu to contact Father Raoult, the person in charge, to discuss cooperation methods, which was very successful. Father Raoult designated the original site of the Danhua Primary School, which the society was responsible for establishing as a shelter to accommodate the displaced compatriots along Minguo Road. After the society accepted, the entire staff mobilized, under the leadership of Supervisor Jiang Maorong, working hard for three days and nights, and first sorted out the Danhua Shelter to avoid chaos. There are now more than 700 refugees. Before the refugee camp began distributing rice and grain, the society did its best to raise funds to supplement any food shortages. After rice distribution began on the 2nd of this month, the Danhua side procured fuel, boilers, chopsticks, and bowls from the society to address their shortages. Milk paste was also distributed to breastfeeding infants to supplement insufficient breast milk. Recently, refugees have been suffering from hunger and cold, and because southerners are not accustomed to eating wheat, diseases are rampant and deaths have followed. Many of the society's staff are experts in traditional Chinese medicine, so they proposed the idea of providing free medical treatment and medicine. The proposal was approved at a joint meeting of the society's directors and supervisors. The Yuzhai residence at 270 Yanhai Road was selected as the treatment location and opened on December 1. The daily limit is 200. All medicine costs are free. It is reported that hundreds of sick refugees go for treatment every day. The clinic is currently staffed by doctors Shen Zhiming, Pan Yusheng, Zhu Liyun, Tao Yiqing, Zhou Jiheng, Zhang Huailin, Tong Qinde, and Gu Borong in rotation, with Fan Shuyu and You Chunong assisting.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Pullers Association Transfers Literacy Education Funds to Purchase National Bonds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rickshaw Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau to collect a literacy education fee of 30 cents per rickshaw starting in April of this year, totaling 14,512.50 yuan for four months. Now, the association believes that in these difficult times, since literacy education cannot be carried out, it should take urgent action and transfer all the funds to purchase national salvation bonds to meet the needs.</p>
<h3>Songjiang Fellow Villagers Association Relieves Fellow Villager Refugees</h3>
<p>Distributing to Various Shelters Seeking News from Hometown</p>
<p>The Songjiang Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association on Lafayette Road previously felt that fellow villagers who had come to Shanghai to escape the disaster were in urgent need of relief, so it specially organized a Refugee Relief Committee to actively raise funds and engage in relief work. Later, after the relief work came to an end, the Refugee Relief Committee also ended, and the work of relieving fellow villager refugees was still carried out by the Fellow Villagers Association. It is reported that about 1,000 refugees have registered with the association, and hundreds have requested shelter. Due to economic reasons, the association cannot set up its own shelter. All the registered fellow villagers who requested shelter have been sent to the refugee shelters set up by charitable organizations for disaster relief. The association provides each person with a blanket to keep out the cold. It is also learned that the association is seeking various news from their hometown to supply hometown information. Fellow villagers can call 82798 to contact them.</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers Seeking News</h3>
<p>Dongting Xishan  For the purpose of seeking news from their hometown, the Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association especially hopes that recently some fellow villagers have come to Shanghai to escape disaster from their hometown or have received letters and telegrams and know the current situation of their hometown for sure, they can immediately notify the temporary office of the association at 26 Tongchunfang, Baker Road, telephone 91239, or the Shanghai Office of the Xishan Red Cross Society Branch at 494 Xinzha Road, telephone 21290, so that it can be transferred to various fellow villagers.</p>
<p>Jiashan After being reduced to a war zone, the postal and telegraph services were interrupted and news was separated. If anyone knows the following three items, they can tell Mr. Hu Yizang at 7 Shanqing Lane, Qipu Road. ⑴ Has the Cao residence in Gujiadai, the Xu residence in Xiaosiquiao, the Chen residence in Shouyamen, the Ding residence in Caojiadai, the Huang residence of Shansantang at Rihui Bridge in Jiashan city, and the Zhangjing Hui Jiuqu Li and other places outside the city been affected by the artillery fire? ⑵ Has anyone known the whereabouts of Cao Lisheng Tu Huizi Cao Peihua and others who fled to Shuanglin Jiashan in Huzhou? ⑶ Has anyone known the news of Xu Boyin's family who fled to Naxiang Jiashan?</p>
<p>Taicang After the fall, news was cut off. If there are any fellow villagers from the area and the surrounding four townships who have recently taken refuge in Shanghai or have received telegrams and know the current situation of their hometown for sure, they can write to Yang Yuming of Shenbao Newspaper or call 93245.</p>

<h3>Tongren Fuyuantang Works Hard on Burial Work</h3>
<p>Coffins are Lacking, Working Day and Night to Rush Production  Especially Hopeful that Enthusiastic Benevolent People Will Donate Widely</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle on August 13, Tongren Fuyuantang and Pushan Mountain Villa, two charitable organizations in this port, immediately organized burial teams to start from scratch, regardless of boundaries, to the war zone and the four suburbs to collect the wounded and dead soldiers, the deceased compatriots, and the bodies of the wounded soldiers and refugees in Shanghai's rescue hospitals and shelters, and transport them to the charitable cemetery for burial. Achievements are outstanding. Since the fall of Nanshi, the land and water transportation between Shanghai and various inland villages has been cut off, and the coffins collected by the two institutions cannot be transported out, and the accumulation in the concession has affected the work. After consultation, the British and French Industrial Bureaus have found a place for temporary burial in the quiet places of Caojiadu and Hongqiao in western Shanghai, but Pushan Mountain Villa needs time to clean up the burial area because the coffins it has collected cover a wide area and are too heavily stacked. Therefore, from the 1st of this month, the bodies of wounded soldiers and refugees in the rescue hospitals and shelters in the French Concession and the relief societies affiliated with Jiaotong University and the Nanshi Refugee Area, which were received by Pushan Mountain Villa, were handled by Tongren Fuyuantang for corpse collection and burial work. The Public Concession is still handled by Pushan Mountain Villa. However, since Tongren Fuyuantang took over, the number of large and small corpses of wounded soldiers and refugees collected every day has increased several times compared with the war period. The original workers, yamen and vehicles are very busy and cannot cope with the situation. It is still regretted that the coffins cannot be produced in time. The coffin shop of the church was originally located in Nanshi. During the fall, there were nearly a thousand upper, middle, and lower coffins and plank coffins, with a value of nearly 30,000 gold. Before they could be moved out, they were all turned into nothing. As a result, even though a temporary workshop has been set up in the concession in recent days, and materials have been purchased and workers hired, it is still difficult to meet the demand, especially the lack of small coffins. Although the various groups, agencies, enthusiastic benefactors have donated, but it is still not enough. The hall will not abandon its achievements over the years in this extraordinary period, and strictly insists on the principle of one coffin for each body, regardless of size. In recent days, it has sent people to find and purchase wood materials everywhere, and has asked Siming Guild Hall and Jiren Assistance Materials Association to help rush to make plank coffins to meet the needs. On the one hand, people are sent to the refugee area in three batches in the morning and afternoon to collect corpses, and to clear up the corpses and coffins piled up in the streets and alleys, and transport them to the burial ground for burial.</p>
<h3>Searching the Opium Den and Seizing Military Supplies</h3>
<p>Detaining Three Male and Female Offenders Waiting for Investigation of the Case and Re-Interrogation</p>
<p>Laozha Police Station Chinese Detective Jin Mianceng, Detective Weng Hongxun, and Detective Gao Yong'an learned that someone had privately set up an opium den at 22, Lane 736, Fujian Road, and then requested the First Special District Court to sign a search warrant. At 8:00 PM the night before, they went to search. Unexpectedly, a large number of military supplies were seized, including a box cannon, 25 bullets, 2 pistols, 125 bullets, a smoking gun, and one or two of opium. Wu Xingren Zheng Xueqin, Changshu woman Zheng Li, and Songjiang woman Shen Chen were arrested and taken back to the police station together. This morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. The police station's lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested permission to postpone the investigation because it was urgent to investigate whether the defendants in this case had committed any illegal acts. After interrogation by Judge Feng, they were ordered to be remanded in custody and re-interrogated.</p>
<h3>Coffins and Graves Pile Up on the Southern End of Huanlong Bridge in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Refugees in the Nanshi refugee area are dying one after another, and there have been more than a hundred people before and after. On the 4th of this month, there were 10 adult corpses and 7 children's corpses, and on the 5th, there were 8 adult corpses and 6 children's corpses. The current burial method is to collect from all sides by the Red Swastika Society, and the corpses are completely placed in the north □ of the Huanlong Bridge behind the City God Temple in Yuyuan. The person in charge is Xue Lisheng, who works in Deyilou. After the corpses are collected, Tongren Fuyuantang prepares coffins to collect them, and Pushan Mountain Villa is responsible for burial. However, the refugee area is like a bird cage with no way to pass through, so the south □ of Huanlong Bridge, where fortunetellers used to gather, is used as a temporary charitable cemetery. There are more than a hundred coffins floating there as of today, which is really unsanitary. If Nanshi and the concession are not opened to each other, it is feared that there will be no place to bury the dead in the area in the future.</p>
<h3>Homicide Conviction</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</p>
<p>Lu Fusheng, the owner of the Secret Code Guide Agency at 259 Yunnan Road, defrauded Ji Yongyu, a native of Jiangyin, of a deposit of 60 yuan, and then gave him the position of accountant, but the salary was never paid. Recently, he even planned to drive Ji away, which made Ji resentful. At 6:00 AM on the 19th of last month, he used the iron cover of the stove to smash Lu's head several times, causing serious injuries and death. Ji was subsequently arrested by Chen Yonggui, a Chinese detective at the Laozha Police Station, at 18, Lane 574, Tiantong Road, and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened a criminal court and announced the judgment. Ji Yongyu was sentenced to life imprisonment for homicide and deprived of his civil rights for life.</p>
<h3>Clerk of the Second Special Court Embezzles</h3>
<p>Misappropriating Fines  Discovered and Interrogated</p>
<p>Zhang Guancheng, a native of Suzhou, a clerk and criminal court clerk of the Second Special District Local Court of Jiangsu and Shanghai, is 36 years old this year. After the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle, the court was ordered to reduce staff and Zhang was retained on suspension of pay. When Zhang handed over his duties on September 30, it was discovered that Zhang had privately embezzled fines and bail money paid by the parties involved during his tenure, totaling hundreds of yuan. At that time, only 160 yuan was found to have been privately used in the five volumes, and 13 volumes were destroyed by Zhang and could not be handed over. After Wang Simo, the president of the court, learned about it, he immediately arrested Zhang and transferred him to the procuratorate. After repeated investigations by Prosecutor Wang Ren, it was found to be true. He then filed a public prosecution on the basis of Article 131, paragraph 1, Article 217, Article 336, paragraph 2, Article 134, and Article 138 of the Criminal Code, etc., for dereliction of duty, forgery of seals, and embezzlement. Yesterday, Criminal Court President Liao Jing opened a court hearing. First, Prosecutor Wang Chen stated the intent of the prosecution, and then interrogated Zhang Guancheng. Zhang admitted that he had used his power to privately use public funds because he was under economic pressure. As for the lost volumes, some were stolen and lost, and some were torn up by his children at home and could not be handed over. He asked for leniency. The court then remanded Zhang and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>A Young Girl Sheltered in a Refuge Was Abducted and Sold into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Unable to Bear the Pain, She Escaped Privately, But Was Caught and Sent to Court Mid-Journey</p>
<p>He Xiaomei, a seventeen-year-old girl from Zhenru, was taken in by a refuge on Robison Road due to her parents scattering during the war. At that time, a woman named Zhang Gao came to the refuge and became acquainted with her. After Zhang persuaded and lured her in every possible way, a month ago, Zhang abducted He Xiaomei from the refuge and sold her to Wang Jufu, who ran a brothel at No. 29 Yanqing Road, Xiamen Road, for seventy yuan. On the 29th of last month, Wang forcibly raped He Xiaomei twice, while Wang's concubine, Gu Xiaomei, assisted from the side. After He Xiaomei's chastity was violated, Wang forced her into prostitution, but the girl refused, resulting in constant beatings. Unable to bear the pain, the girl, taking advantage of a moment of unguardedness at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, secretly fled to a place on Caishi Road in the French Concession with a rickshaw puller named Changjiao. Unexpectedly, she was found and forced back by Wu Genfa, who Wang had ordered to live with her, and the prostitute Gu Lijun. When passing Fujian Road, He Xiaomei cried out to Chinese detectives Yang Guanying and Ding Yizhong, who arrested Wu and Gu and took them back to the Laozha police station. After investigating the truth, they went to No. 114 Xiamen Road and arrested Wang Jufu and Gu Xiaomei, and also arrested Zhang Gao at No. 690 Guangdong Road. Yesterday, they were all taken to the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested a postponement, arguing that further investigation was necessary. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, the postponement for one week for further questioning was approved.</p>
<h3>The Cilianhui Appeals for Cotton Clothes and Quilts for Refugees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cilianhui Refugee Relief Branch has been providing relief to no less than two to three hundred thousand refugees. Apart from those sent to other locations and those who voluntarily returned to their hometowns, there are still sixty to seventy thousand people being sheltered. However, donations are currently less than before, resulting in severe financial difficulties for the association. The daily cost of providing for the refugees is enormous, and they have no time to attend to refugees' quilts, cotton coats, and cotton trousers. Moreover, most donations are cotton vests, so women and children cannot benefit from them. The weather has been gradually turning cold recently, already in the thirties and forties. Afterwards, when wind and snow mix, the freezing hardship will be even more difficult to describe. It is now heard that in various shelters, the daily average of those who are sick due to the cold and die due to illness numbers in the dozens. It is deeply hoped that kind-hearted gentlemen, ladies, and celebrities in Shanghai will donate clothing to help refugees survive the cold with the money saved from frugal living. The more the better, the sooner the better. If a constant stream of aid is received, your merit will be immeasurable, and the refugees will be endlessly grateful. Receiving address: 2nd floor of the Pudong Association, No. 1454 Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Women's Circles Initiate a Disaster Relief Exhibition and Sale</h3>
<p>Individuals and Organizations are Welcome to Participate</p>
<p>As the weather gradually turns cold, the suffering of refugees increases daily, especially for those wandering on various roads. Seeing this, Shanghai women's leaders Liu Wang Liming, Hu Ying, Yang Nie Ling, Yu Tang Aimei, Chen Naiwen, Chuan Xiaofeng, Zhang Dezhao, and other ladies, especially initiated the Shanghai Women's Craft Disaster Relief Exhibition and Sale at the Kaisiling Western Restaurant on Jing'an Temple Road a few days ago. It will be held on the 18th and 19th of this month. All income will be donated to disaster relief. Individuals and organizations are welcome to participate. The preparatory work is currently being handled by the committee members Chen Yongsheng, Zhou Aizhu, Zhou Zhong Huiqing, and Xue Zheng, who were recommended.</p>
<h3>French Police Discover Murdered Male Corpse in Tushanwan</h3>
<p>Covered in Stab Wounds, Report to be Verified Today</p>
<p>Since the war in Nanshi shifted westward, the police power in the Tushanwan area of ​​Xujiahui in western Shanghai has been temporarily maintained by patrol officers dispatched by the French police. Yesterday at 9:40 AM, Russian patrol officer No. 213 of the French police discovered the body of an unknown man stabbed to death in a farmer's field on Yinjia Pavilion Road in front of the Tushanwan Orphanage. The man looked like a villager, about forty years old. His head, face, upper and lower right eye, and right leg were covered in stab wounds. The officer immediately reported to the police station, and the body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-Hall for examination. It is expected that a member will be assigned to verify the report by the Second Special Court today. According to general speculation, the incident occurred in the Chinese area. The police station has dispatched detectives to investigate the truth of the household that was killed.</p>
<h3>Colleagues of the Commercial Press Promote the One-Penny Movement</h3>
<p>All colleagues from the General Management Office, Publishing House, various factories, and various branch stores of the Commercial Press in this city have been actively promoting the daily one-penny movement to relieve refugees since the first of this month. The implementation method is particularly complete, and the enthusiasm for relief is especially commendable. It is said that considerable achievements have been made since implementation.</p>
<h3>Nantong's Transportation of Pigs to Shanghai Requires Certification from the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Release Will Absolutely Not be Granted Lightly</p>
<p>The Nantong Martial Law Command informed the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce that, from now on, ships transporting pigs from Tianshenggang to Shanghai will be released after verification of their Chamber of Commerce certification documents. Those without certification documents will be handled separately, and release will absolutely not be granted lightly.</p>
<h3>The Iron Gate on Avenue Eduard VII Was Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Because the intersection of Zhejiang Road and Avenue Eduard VII is close to the North Railway Station, the concession authorities closed the iron gate there and prohibited pedestrians from passing after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. Those traveling from Zhejiang Road to Avenue Eduard VII had to detour east via North Xish Road and North Henan Road to reach their destination. It is now learned that the iron gate there was opened yesterday, allowing pedestrians to go directly from Zhejiang Road to Avenue Eduard VII, without having to detour. As for the Route 5 tram, it still only runs to the front of the First Special Court as the terminus and has not been able to extend north.</p>
<h3>The Shuntian Wheel Arrives in Shanghai from Tianjin Loaded with Large Quantities of Vegetables</h3>
<p>Unloading Started Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>The British-owned Taikoo Steamship Company's Shuntian wheel arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin the night before last and berthed at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, loaded with large quantities of soybeans and preserved vegetables. Unloading began at 9:00 AM yesterday morning. The soybeans are temporarily stored in the Taikoo warehouse, and the preserved vegetables are temporarily piled on the wharf.</p>
<h3>The Gold Standard Market is Bleak, Gold Firms Suspend Operations and Liquidate</h3>
<p>Chen Da, Wanxing, and Zhengchang Declare Closure</p>
<p>After the implementation of the new monetary policy in the Shanghai Gold Standard Market, the trading volume decreased significantly. Generally, gold firms felt it difficult to maintain their operations. Since the outbreak of the August 13th War, the Gold Standard Market has suspended business, and the business of exchange brokers has suddenly ceased. Recently, it has been heard that Chen Da, Wanxing, and Zhengchang, three gold firms, have voluntarily suspended operations and liquidated.</p>
<h3>The British-Owned Yizhong Tobacco Factory in Pudong Officially Resumes Work Today</h3>
<p>The British-owned Yizhong Tobacco Factory in Pudong has rescheduled its official reopening for today (the 7th). However, one-third of the factory's male and female workers are scattered in the interior and have not been able to arrive, while two-thirds are renting houses in the concession. Therefore, the factory has obtained the consent of the Municipal Council to build a floating wharf on the Bund Garden foreshore. Special ships and iron barges are dispatched to pick up and drop off workers every morning and evening. All factory workers with copper badges and photos can enter the park on time to board. The rumor that workers take ships at the New Customs Wharf to enter the factory is inaccurate.</p>
<h3>The Criminal Court of the First Special Court Moves Back and Continues Hearings</h3>
<p>Four Courts to Open First</p>
<p>The criminal cases of the First Special District Court were implemented yesterday, with courts reopening at the original site on North Zhejiang Road. Four courts are currently open: Courts 1, 2, 3, and 9. There is no news yet that the High Court Branch No. 2 has moved back, so the British military headquarters stationed in this area remains temporarily located inside the High Court Branch No. 2. President Guo Yunguan personally inspected the various courts yesterday. If the results are good, then the entire court will be moved back soon.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai YMCA Organizes a Christmas Day for Disaster-Stricken Children</h3>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor: After reading the report in the Shenbao on the 6th of this month regarding the changing of the flag-raising regulations of our association, there appears to be a misunderstanding. All of our association's public grandstands are currently being used by British troops, so the public grandstand was not used for this race. On this public grandstand, apart from the British national flag and the flag of the British troops, no other flags can be added, which is not a change of regulations. As for the members' grandstand and the guests' grandstand, apart from the usual racecourse flags on the clock tower, there are no other flagpoles to hang Chinese or British national flags, so none are hung to show uniformity. We are especially explaining this to avoid misunderstandings from all walks of life. We hope you will publish this in your esteemed newspaper to clarify the truth. Sincerely, The Secretariat of the Shanghai Race Club.</p>
