<h3>中英日進行三解折衝</h3>
<p>日電傳我與英談廢治外法權　川越大使會見佐藤外相進言　日擬乘機振作外交挽回政局</p>
<p>［東京］中國擬與各國開始交涉撤廢治外法權、日本政府因在明治維新當時有此經騐、對於中國當然不惜表示同情、然認撤廢領判權須以司法制度之完備為第一條件、且其撤廢以漸進的方法逐步進行為要、故如有中國政府之正式提議、則參考各國態度而决定方針、（四日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］川越大使三日下午訪問佐藤外相、報告赴任後在中國發生之各種事件、及解决此種事件之中日交涉內容、中國自西安事什發生後之悄勢等、並關於將來調整中日關係作重要進言、經一小時始辭出、川越大使擬於兩三日內再會見外相、交換意見、據聞大使關於日政府對華外交之再檢討、保持堅固决心、故其今後言動頗堪注目、（四日同盟電）</p>

<h3>國防線上（三）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員　叔棣</p>
<p>院子裏有幾輛很大的載重卡車停在黑暗中。這些，是偽軍反正後，由敵方帶來的。現在，牠們正在準備把反正部隊的什物，向晋南運去。通夜裏，牠們不住地響着喇叭，閃着車燈。人聲吵雜着，脚步聲曳踏着，雜物時時發碰擊的聲音。……</p>
<p>我被吵得通夜睡不着。然而，我立刻知道了：巧得很，在這裏恰恰遇到由綏遠向晋南開去的金憲章的部隊。</p>
<p>“你們金師長在這裏嗎！”我問。</p>
<p>“師長今天到太原去了。”</p>
<p>我有點惆悵：失去一個暢談的機會。聽聽那些吵雜的聲音，細細一辨，立刻辨出了那裏面的各色各樣的方言：山東口音，河南口音，河北口香，偶爾也有東三省的口音。想想這些人們過去的經歷和遭遇：由“土匪”而“國軍，”而“散匪，”而“僞軍，”而“侵綏的偽軍”而“反正部隊。”令人有說不出的感歎，而到今天他們到底又和我們同站在一起，四萬五千萬同胞，共同負起挽救國家民族危亡的重担來了。於敬佩裏，我更有一種說不出的親切和興奮。</p>
<p>自從去年他們反正，使大廟順利收復，令敵人膽寒以來，這幾個月裏，也曾經調動了幾次，受過了些訓練。現在，他們的軍紀，非常嚴明，各方面對他們發出的，總是異口同聲的稱贊和鼓勵。這回閻百川氏在綏遠的時候，和傳作養等高級將領計議的結果，决定把這部份反正部隊，調到晋南一帶去，更進一步加以嚴格訓練，以便成為國家衛土保民的勁旅。對他們的期望，是很大的。明天一早，他們就要向雁門關內的陽明堡開拔，在那裏，就搭上同蒲路的車子，一直開往晋南（後來我在太原得到消息，他們最後駐紮地，是介休一帶去了）但願他們緊記着全國人的期望，當局的苦心以及他們本身反正的初衷，向光明的大道上邁進！</p>
<p>大同是山西北部的第一個重鎮，是平綏路上的一個大站，同時，也是我國對日，在華北方面遙長的國防線裏的，一個很重要的鎮鑰。去年八月，匪軍王道部下，曾經有一度竄擾陽高，意思在進規大同，主要的作用，是企圖佔據這里，而切斷我們綏遠前線與後方的聯絡，萬一如其所想，那末，另一個作用，是威脅山西，打破晋綏的聯合戰線，還再有一個附帶作用，就是：如果敵人看到時機順利，他們會由這裏西回拊綏還之背，直趨綏境的伊克昭盟，一直達到寗夏的阿拉善額魯特旗，和額濟納土爾扈特旗，而實現敵人蓄之已久的“大元帝國”陰謀的。那時，這一條路上的敵人特務機關，早已存在，再用匪偽軍的竄擾方法，把沿路關碍打通，然後，敵人勢力的隨之而至，那情形，是會呈“水到渠成”之觀的。然而，王道匪部的嘗試，第一下就碰到了硬釘子，擋了回去：接着，緩東抗戰爆發了，敵人就集中力量，到綏東方而去進擾。其後的百餘天裏，敵人的西進路線，雖然屢屢變更，一下子着重綏北，一下子着重綏東，但自始至終，陽高，大同這條路線，是一直在緊張的危機裏。不說別的萬一當時綏東的與和，不幸失守的話，那末，這條路線的危險，一定會和綏北，綏東兩條路線，一樣的緊急起來，全部的綏戰歷史，或許會成為另外一個樣子，也說不定。</p>
<p>從聯繫綏戰前線和後方上說，從聯鎖晋綏兩省聯合戰線上說，或從大同本身地勢上說，大同總是我國對日，在華北方面，國防線上的一個銷鑰，一個重鎮，一個要塞。</p>
<p>近來，當局早已注意到，這裏的重要性。所以，在晋，綏所築東沿太行山經天鎮，大同到綏之興和，陶林等地的防禦線裏，大同也是個最緊要的處所。我這回原來的打算，在大同，不想多躭擱幾天，臨時因種種原故，不得不匆匆離去。在綏遠會見李服膺先生的時候，曾和他約定，在這裏考察時，請他給予種種便刊，蒙他一口答允，並表示很希望我能在大同多看一看；然而這個約，這時也來不及踐了。</p>
<p>後來在太原，有個朋友和我談到雲崗，我告訴他我並沒有去逛，他就驚異地跳起來道：</p>
<p>“怎麼！過大同不逛雲崗？那你豈不是。”</p>
<p>我明瞭，他的意思，是說我白過大同了；我就搖搖手止住他，說：“祇要領土保住，古蹟隨時可來看的。這回，先看看別的更要緊的東西；至於逛古蹟的事，我希望在最近幾年內，可以有個比現在更讓我們寬心的時機，那時，我們可以再來個純粹的遊歷旅行。”</p>
<p>我們相對苦等；岂也更加興奮了。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>英日對華合作的傳說輔</h3>
<p>日本對華政策的骨幹是大陸政策的厲行。這是誰也知道的事。根據這個政策。日本反對歐美勢力的侵入遠東。並不願中國去同英美等國接近。可是到了最近。英日對華合作的消息郤盛傳於東京與倫敦兩地。東京日新聞首先於上月二十一日登載英國向日建議對華合作的消息從來倫敦報紙也刋出日本向英建議對華合作的新聞並謂兩國外交代表現已密切接觸不久卽將有具體的表現。這事情的發展對於我國實有非常重大的關係。</p>
<p>英日合作的問題。日本報紙雖然說是英國方面先向日本提出的。可是我們相信這事的主動者還是在東京方面。日本現在為什麼會改變過去獨吞中國的政策而要求英國共同合作呢。這是有很重要的原因的。第一。中國自從去年兩廣事件與西安事變和平解决以後。統一的力量已經大增。日本是再不能以先前的急進政策來對待我們了。其次。由於我國統一局面的增強。國際的關係也大有增進。尤其是去年西安事變以後。英美蘇聯等國的對華關係更有重大的改進。這種密切關係的形成。實是日本行使積極侵略政策的結果現在日本如再不改變對華政策。那末這些和平國家的關係。必將有更進一步的結合了。再次就是日本議會選舉的結果。政府的威信業已大减。軍部的對華急進政策已經遭受日本人民一致的反對因此日本政府就不能不改變過去的政策而向英國提議對華合作了。</p>
<p>日本要求英國對華合作。旣然出於這種不得已的原因。因此它對我國的野心自然也不會完全放棄。兩國合作的內容與條件。現在雖還沒有具體化。但據各報所載。大致不外以下數點。㊀日本承認英國在華中華南之旣成經濟發展。㊁英國承認日本在華北之特殊經濟與軍事策略上的利益但滿洲國之承認並不為主要條件。㊂英美日法共同以債欵貸與中國。㊃中日兩國成立友好條約。這種合作辦法如果完全實現。不管是將中國瓜分為英日的保護地了。</p>
<p>日本這種建議在本質上是可以得英國政界的贊許的因為英國的對華政策。向來着重於經濟勢力的擴展。以前英國經濟專使李滋羅斯兩次訪問東京。就是想與日本政府商妥合作的辦法。使英國的經濟利益不至過受損害。但李滋羅斯的企圖終究因日本軍部的强硬態度而失敗了現在日本如能改變獨吞中國的政策而承認英國在華中與華南的特殊利益那當然是倫敦政府所求之不得的不過我們對於英日合作的前途並不能作這樣樂觀的觀察日本所以向英建議合作祇不過是想緩和國際的空氣。離間中英的感情。並沒有把獨吞中國的大陸政策眞正放棄的意思所以要想日本改變對華政策。並使我國不成為帝國主義者侵略的對象。那祇有我們全國上下團結一致。與侵略者作死活的鬥爭。除此以外。似乎再沒有什麼路可走了。</p>
<h3>林內閣對政黨實行以逸待勞</h3>
<p>解散與總辭看形勢再定　擬以三閣席餌政黨黨員</p>

<p>㊁對付特別議會之態度、特別議會開幕後、政黨方面將提不信任案、亦未可知、然再行解散議會、或實行總辭職之問題、待特別議會開會、判斷其情形如何後、方可决定、政府將在議會中判斷議員之言論、政黨之態度、及其他各種悄形、而知新選議員之對時局之認識、與政府認識相異時、可以考慮再度解散議會之事、</p>
<p>㊂補住閣員問題、政府擬於早時補任閣員、卽由各方面詮衡適當人物、將於十五日以前、决定文部•鐵道•拓務•三閣員、在現在情形之下、尚未考慮與政黨交涉入閣之問題、余對於政黨之所感、與組閣當時無異、余希望所謂新黨成立、然余自己不願積極實行組黨工作、蓋總選舉後之形勢如此、樹立新黨極為困難也，（四日同盟電）</p>

<p>［東京］茲據國民新聞載稱、林首相之聲明、各政黨與貴族院各界、均極不為然、今將促迫內閣立卽辭職、樞密院向對政局作壁上觀、今亦抱反政府之情緒、同時首相之戀機、觀於渠與新聞訪員問答之言、而益可信、（中央社四日路透電）</p>

<h3>參加英王加冕禮我國特使團西行記</h3>
<p>過新加坡的觀感</p>
<p>群倫坡通訊、中國赴英慶賀英王加冕代表團所乘的維多利亞郵船、於四月九日早九點、便到了新加坡、在碼頭歡迎的、有總領事高凌百、以及華僑一百三十八個團體的代表每個團體有代表四人他們都手持國旗、站在碼頭上、靜候孔特使及代表團下船、大家下船之後、便坐華僑所預備的一百餘輛汽車、先到總領事館、略為休息後便往參觀晚晴園、據當地人談、係總理當初在此設同盟會、靑天白日旗、便在這兒製定、園廣約數畝、中有一樓現已倒敗不堪、樓已無頂不能蔽風雨此地的僑胞、為紀念總理起見、已集了五千塊錢把這個地方買下、最近中央已决定撥洋一萬五千元、重修此園、將來凡路過新加坡的同胞、應當都到此地來瞻仰、</p>
<p>在晚晴園攝影後、孔特使先應國民黨同志之請、在同德書報社作短時間的公開演說然後順道到中華總商會、參與僑胞各界的歡迎大會、此時會塲內外及四圍、都站滿了歡迎的人士孔特使的專車到後、大衆均鼓掌歡迎、在歡迎會中、孔特使演說、對於過去新加坡僑胞之功績、盛加頌揚、並勉以精誠團結、努力合作、以發展自己的事業、並謀祖國之復興、最後、孔特使謂中國最近數年之努力、已確立富强之基礎、其具體事實、由翁秘書長另為說明、孔特使與陳副使、因已應英國海軍當局之約、參觀新加坡軍港故演說完畢後、卽行告別、但歡迎會仍繼續舉行、由翁秘書長略述過去數年中國在各方面之建設、對於公路•鐵路•輕工業•重工業•等等、均有說細的說明、對於關心祖國的僑胞、給以極大的安慰、</p>
<p>新加坡的軍港、英國人已化了五千萬美金建設、現在還未完工、英國人視此為禁地、禁止外人參觀、這次孔特使過星、英國當局、特別請他去參觀、可見中英的友誼、非汎汎之交可比、</p>
<p>參觀軍港後、英總督特設宴歡迎孔特使•陳副使•翁秘書長•及各位參贊、其餘的人、便到星洲日報參與中國銀行的宴會、席設南天酒樓在船上幾天、吃的都是西餐、現在忽然吃到一頓道地的中國菜同人均喜出望外、南天酒樓的東家、據云也是華僑、但因在海外多年、對於祖國已甚冷淡、歐戰時、彼個人曾助英國飛機一架、但對於中國空軍的建設、並無若何貢獻、像這種華僑、我們有什麼方法、使他們對於祖國、重新燃起熱情來呢、這實是留心華僑敎育的人、所應考慮的問題、</p>
<p>新加坡的富商、以萬金油起家的胡文虎胡文豹昆仲、在下午三點、也開一茶會、歡迎孔特使及代表團、座設於巴士班讓的虎豹別墅、此別墅落成不久、據云共化國幣六七十萬元、在國內很少看見那樣富麗的建築、我們雖然離開了上海一個多星期、經過了英國美國的屬地多處、但大家都好像仍在國內旅行似的、特別是在新加坡在街上看見的多是中國人、中國店中國招牌、原來新加坡的人口、有五分之四、盡是中國人、據此地經商的人說新加坡的經濟基礎、建築在兩種商品之上、一量樹膠、一為錫、在四五年前不景氣的時代、樹膠只售五六元一百斤、現在售到六十元一百斤、前數年錫只值二十元一擔、現在售到一百元以上、（都用本地的貨幣計算）、所以今年在新加坡經商的人、都很獲利、華僑在此地謀生的都有餘欵寄回去、據中國銀行的代表說、去年從七月到十二月、華僑由該行匯欵回國的數目、約一千五六百萬、今年只過三個月已有七八百萬匯回去了、在此種景氣之下、本地政府對於華僑入口的限制也就放鬆了、以前只准每月入口四千人、現已增至六千人、不久可望增至七千、</p>
<p>新加坡是華僑的世界、我們離開新加坡、才感到眞的離開中國了、</p>

<h3>綏邊偽軍小組部隊出沒邊村</h3>
<p>目的在擾亂防軍　並搶掠馬匹財物</p>
<p>張北通訊、最近外傳某方已由熱境運大批坦克車等重兵器到南壕塹、並令偽軍向西挺進、及偽軍進攻綏東興和集寗等消息、揆以目前察北實際情况、頗不盡然、茲將關係方面所得消息、分述於後、</p>
<p>四月二十八日夜間七時許至九時止、南壕塹附近、發生槍砲聲音、又連日以　、沿邊各地、亦發生斷續槍聲、據確實報告、四月二十八日晚間、有偽軍第一師劉繼廣部約二十餘人、乘夜色迷濛之際、潛至南壕塹附近、企圖乘鄉民不備、闖入搶掠、經當地保衛團發覺、立予痛擊、旋為防軍所聞、乃嗚砲為團丁助威、偽軍一無所獲、廢然敗回、緣偽軍多半均係騎兵、馬匹缺少、財物尤尠、故常以二•三•十成羣之小組部、出沒於綏東沿邊村鎮、目的祇在得獲馬匹、飽掠財物、偽方亦以偽兵在綏邊搶掠、兼可擾亂國軍防禦、故亦往其所為、是以近來不斷發生槍聲、</p>
<p>偽軍此種舉動、一如過去兩次犯綏前之挑釁行為、今仍用其故智、故頗堪注意、幸晋緩防軍早有充分準備、偽方徒自紛擾、固無關乎大局至於偽方軍隊、近中除間有調防者外、迄未向前方增兵、且某方所派監視指導偽軍之軍官、現已完全退出、對偽軍顯有不信任之表示、在此種塲合中、勢難以坦克車等重武器運送前方、且此等武器、自百靈廟•大廟子•兩處為國軍克復後垮已陸續撤回、充其量、亦不過運至熱西、待機而發耳、</p>
<p>惟多倫某方乏飛機塲、現正在積極擴大建築中、過去某方本以為一鼓可下綏包、故對於張北•商都•嘉卜寺•之飛機塲、妥為建設、預作根據、是以對多倫塲址、不甚重視、迨西進碰壁、始覺多倫機塲簡陋、實有擴大之必要、連日以來、某方正加緊趕築營房•倉庫•宿舍等、對於策動偽軍西進、以目前情勢觀察、大約最近短期內或不致發動、（一日）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>呌孩子們來親善</h3>
<p>— 墨西</p>
<p>中日兩國現在到底“親善”到如何程度，簡直有些令人如墮五里霧中。日浪人旣屢次歐傷關員，名古屋舉行的“汎太平洋博覽會”又把中華民國與“冀東館”，“滿洲館”並列，其他如“閑話皇帝”而坐牢，拋生梨皮而獲罪，細枝末棄，不勝枚舉。“人旣加害於我們，我們不能不予以抵抗”，看來要“敦睦邦交”，確非易事。</p>
<p>於是有人認為“中日兩國之親善，應由兩國兒童之親善着手。”兒童是國家將來之主人翁，先從他們的幼年時代着手親善，所謂“抱貓要抱吃奶貓”，自然可以“事半功倍”：而且兒童天真爛漫，在一起唱唱歌，跳跳舞，又那裏分得清“侵略”與“親善”之不同，這真是個“根本解决”的好辦法。現在該項辦法果然由長崎縣當局與市當局協議出具體方法來了，是“由長崎市內各小學校選㧞男女學生十人，為學生代表，將於五月二十三日由敎師五人率領，乘長崎丸渡華，訪問上海，南京，蘇州，杭州各地小學校，至六月初回國。長崎縣當局待一行回國後，將於六月中旬或下旬在長崎勝山小學舉行展覽會，陳列中日兩國小學生之圖畫，寫字，作文，手工等各項成績品以供一般人參觀；時時召開長崎全市小學生大會，邀請華僑時中小學校學生出席，由赴華學生報告參觀中國各學校之結果，並表演唱歌，音樂，跳舞等助興”云。</p>
<p>不過中國孩子太不能見世面，在公園裏見洋孩子踢球打架，他祇躱在人人身後偸偸張望；在弄裏騎騎三輪脚踏車，又哭着回家，說被隔壁的洋孩子賞了一“火腿”。這遠是在上海見慣洋孩子的孩子們，至若蘇州，杭州各地的孩子，做母親的可以用“東洋人來了”的謊話騙他們乖乖地去睡覺。所幸此次由長崎市內各小學校所“選㧞”的那十位男女學生，他們旣負“親善使命”而來，自然不見得毛手毛脚，使中國孩子望而却步，而且由敎師五人率領，看來至少要做一點“親善”的事實回國報命，這是中國的小學生們可以安心的。</p>
<p>但是“親善”之後，還要回國開展覽會，陳列兩國學生之成績品，並邀請華僑時中學生出席，中國小學生從前讀的是“混沌初開，乾坤始奠”，現在讀的也不過是“小貓呌，小狗跳”；而日本的小學生，據說早已知道“東三省輻員廣大，物產豐富”，與乎“坦克車之效能”，這樣比較起來，說不定在展覽會塲上亦予我國兒童以“極大的刺激”，因而覺得“人旣加害於我們，我們不能不予以抵抗。”則“自昭和九年以來，文部外務兩省後援之下計劃”又將全功盡棄！</p>
<p>呌孩子們來親善也是不行，那還有什麼辦法呢？……</p>
<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 李軒</p>
<p>孩子們在山脚下唱着：</p>
<p>“下雨了，下雨了，放羊的，</p>
<p>把你的白綿羊，快趕到草棚里，</p>
<p>快快跑，雨珠兒響，雷聲兒響，</p>
<p>嚇的羊兒沒處藏……”</p>
<p>天已經黑了，急雨箭一般的掃射着山崖，雨水串過草叢中流下來。激動的瀉在山路上，低窪處濺起一片片小的浪花。天邊浮滿了黑雲，風把樹枝吹的嗚嗚地，年老的牧羊人仍一步步在山腰里爬着，他蓑衣下息率地淋着水，嘴不住的，嘩嘩地呌着，呼喚失了羣的羔羊。</p>
<p>迎頭陣風雨吹來，於是他㨪了下身子，用手弄歪了青草帽，遮住拂向臉上來的雨點，便試探着溜過一個很陡的石坡，剛摸到條泥滑的小道，打無底的深黑的天空中，撒下一個耀眼的閃電，把築在山凹里的一所破舊的寺院照了下，他高聲的嘩嘩着，踩着濕凉的泥路走了過去。</p>
<p>他在虛掩着的廟門邊，聽見有人在里面細小的呻吟，他推開門，在牆角下有個黑影橫臥着，年老的牧羊人顫動着枯乾的手指，將一枝火柴劃亮了，那黑影看來很細弱，正戰競競地打哆嗦，用一幅灰大的衣襟抱裹起件東西，就哭了起來。</p>
<p>老人被驚得不知怎麼作好的呆住了，定了定神，他檢起地下焦乾了的蓬蒿杆子，使火燃着，背了風走到那人跟前：</p>
<p>“你是作什麼的呢？黑夜里一個人………”</p>
<p>那人抖得更厲害，用寬大的袖子遮住了臉，喉嚨里像給寒住了似的，咕咕的儘抽噓着哭泣，地上鋪着薄薄的一片乾草，草被什麼漬濕了，浮面撒了層塵土，在那泥土的空隙處，露出水汪汪般紅的烏血，老人猛的像被擊了一刀似的蹲下來，一隻手緊揑住那顫動着的胳膊，連續的搖㨪了兩下說：</p>
<p>“你：你殺了人？”</p>
<p>那人驚心的哀哭了聲，便把懷里那件東西拋開，重伏到枯草上，一陣乾咳便嘴啃着地面嘔吐起來，雨打塌毀的屋頂飄落進屋里，風把門吹開，隨着火亮也滅熄了，屋子里突的變成一片可怕的沉黑，老人又把火柴摸出來，重新劃着，他握緊一束剛燃起的枯草，將破門板推好，向那滾在泥地上的灰白小東西照去，他害怕的打了個冷戰，呵了一聲，當他伸開粗糙的手掌，撫摸了下那赤裸裸的，微微發點血紅色的剛出世的嬰兒時，小身體已經水凉了，頭髪濕軟得正像初生的羔羊，小嘴撇開着，眼深深的陷了下去，肚臍上還抱着那條跟母體連系的小腸子…………</p>
<p>“老爺爺，你可憐可憐我吧……”</p>
<p>老人扭轉身來，說話的這小女人已跪在地上了，她張着一雙乞救的眼睛，漱漱的落下淚來。她穿着一件灰布的大領袍子，光光的腦頂，圓的小臉上沒一絲血色，兩隻大眼角里泉水般湧出淚來，老人一切都明白了，他望着那顫抖的可憐的女人問：</p>
<p>“孩子的爸爸呢？”</p>
<p>她低着頭，小聲的哭着：</p>
<p>“他是個放羊的，前天我找他來，他已離開了那個村子。”</p>
<p>老人悲痛的嘆了口氣，他夢醒了似的明白過來：那個年青的伙伴，為什麼在一個濃霧的黎明遠行了。他摸摸自己濕潤了的眼睛搖搖頭：</p>
<p>“一條可憐的小生命啊！”</p>
<p>“我要回到庵里去，我沒法子養活他……”</p>
<p>雨聲更大了，傾盆的由山坡上嘩嘩地冲下來，像一條急流的澗水，跳過橫阻着的岩石，黑幽幽的夜空中，不時透出一閃寒冷的電光，沉雷打遠處隆隆的鳴着，一匹迷了路的羊，在密密的雨網下，走過草叢旁的水窪，嘩嘩地，一聲連一聲的哀嗚。</p>
<p>大地的昏黑里，仍飛散着狂風與急電。</p>
<h3>英王加冕時所用的寶物</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>英國王室所有的王冕等御用品，價值之大，幾不能估計。這些珍寶跟金飾平時保藏在倫敦塔中，每遇舉行加冕典禮或國會正式開幕禮時，才取出一用，據說總值在二萬五千萬元至三萬萬元之間。內中有幾樣珍寶，還是中古時代初期所得到的。例如御冕上一方很大的紅寶石，值價約五十萬元，本是格拉那達王所有，後在一三六七年由加斯蒂爾王賜給黑親王。英王亨利在阿琴考特大戰時所戴的盔上，曾鑲着這方紅寶石，那盔現在藏於威斯敏斯特大敎堂。</p>
<p>御用品中有伊麗莎伯所戴的珠耳墜，愛德華所有的子母綠大寶石，還有一塊名呌“柯伊諾爾”的犬鑽石，大約可算得全世界最名貴的，那是曾鑲在印度皇帝的冕上，在九十年前由英軍獻給維多利亞女王。</p>
<p>英王有三種王冕，一是御冕，一是加冕時用的禮冕，一是印度帝冕。加冕時所戴的禮冕，分量太重，不能長戴，那是用黃金製成，上面鑲着珍珠，子母綠寶石，紅寶石，藍寶石，跟鑽石，重五磅有餘，約值十五萬元，加冕時由坎特白里大主敎捧着，放在王的頭上。</p>
<p>印度帝冕是最新的一頂，在一九一二年才製成，喬治王五世那年在印度德里舉行印帝加冕禮時，第一次戴用，手工極精，據說值二十萬元，是用六千粒鑽石跟子母綠寶石紅寶石藍寶石若干方鑲製而成。其中最名貴的是一方大子母綠寶石，還有一方真鴿血紅的印度紅寶石，那是世界上希有的奇珍。</p>
<p>還有加冕戒指，又名英倫結婚戒指，那是行加冕禮時套在王的手指上。每一新王加冕，總得製一個新戒指，現在倫敦塔中已藏着這種戒指三四個。正中是一大方紅寶石，或藍寶石，四周圍着大鑽石。這個戒指，在把金球獻給新王後，便套在王的手指上。那金球是代表統御世界，金球面上鑲着許多寶石，頂上有一大方紫水晶，紫水晶上豎起一個鑽石的十字架，十字架中央有一方紅寶石，它的價值，却沒有人知道。</p>
<p>新王在大敎堂行加冕禮時，坐在御寶座上後，左右便戲上聖愛德杖，那杖又名公道棒，用黃金製成，長約四呎餘。據說原來的聖愛德華杖，有一個十字架，那杖在查理斯王一世受刑後，克林威爾於內戰中席捲許多王室珍寶時失去，現在的一根，是彷舊式重造的。</p>
<p>英王有寶刀四柄，上面都鑲着許多寶石，加冕時也要用着。一是國家寶石刀，值價約十萬元，據說那刀可算得全世界最美觀最貴重的一柄。那是用堅金製成，上面所鑲的一大方藍寶石，值價一萬五千元。那刀由新王獻給敎會，表示歸響之忱，敎會接受之後，再由新王用一百先令買回，其餘的三刀，一名慈愛刀，刀尖是鈍的，表示慈愛之意。一名公道刀，由侍臣在王背後捧着。一也是國刀，上面有一獅跟一獨角獸，表示那是英國王家武器的護衛物。那四刀都用黃金寶石鑲製而成。</p>
<p>新王行加冕禮時，右手握着一個王節，頂上有一塊彷彿拳大的晶亮的玻璃，那是名呌“亞非利加大星”，是全世界最大的鑽石，非剖開之後，不能作別用。除去王冕上的那塊鑽石，跟博物院中陳列的一塊鑽石外，價值要算這塊最貴，是不能估計的。</p>
<p>此外還有黃金製成的踢馬制，由臣下獻給新王放在大敎堂的祭壇上，表示他以英國軍隊領袖的身分獻給上帝。</p>
<p>加冕典禮到最高峯的時候，用一種神油，塗在新皇的面上，表示他由上帝降賜膏澤，並授以萬王的神權。那盛神油的器具，是一隻金鷹，站在一個小空器上，其實神油是盛在這小空器中。這器比較新式，但是那金鷹是一千四百年前的古物，還用千餘年的一個金匙，把油搯出。金匙柄上鑲着四粒珍珠，那式樣是很別緻的，民間曾用各種金屬仿製出售，作為加冕的紀念品。</p>
<p>王后加冕用的物品，沒有這麼多，但是價值也絕巨的。每次新后加冕，總製一個新冕，本年的后冕，不用黃金，改用白金製成，這是英倫歷史上的第一次。新冕的架子，是維多利亞女王所用的頭圈，上面鑲着無數寶石，中央還有大鑽石數塊。</p>

<h3>Special Envoy Kong and His Entourage Arrive in London, Sino-British Dignitaries Hold Grand Meeting</h3>
<p>Welcoming Cooperation among Friendly Nations in Construction, Travel to Europe for Inspection After Coronation</p>
<p>[London] China's special envoy Kong Xiangxi, dispatched to England to attend the coronation of the British King, and his entourage, including Deputy Envoy Chen Shaokuan, arrived at Dover Port this morning. Those who welcomed them at the pier included the King's representative, Admiral Sir Meade Fetherstonhaugh, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom and Deputy Envoy to the coronation, Guo Taiqi, the British Foreign Office representative George, the Air Ministry representative Colonel Willock, the Admiralty representative Lieutenant Commander Hilligan, the War Office representative Major Field, and many others. After disembarking, Special Envoy Kong and his entourage took a car to London, arriving at Victoria Station at 3:30 p.m. Overseas Chinese and key staff members of the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom welcomed them at the station. After getting off the train, Special Envoy Kong, accompanied by Sir Meade Fetherstonhaugh, Deputy Envoy Chen, and Ambassador Guo, rode in the King's carriage to the Chinese delegation's residence at the Langham Hotel to rest. Subsequently, Special Envoy Kong met with reporters and gave a speech stating that he was extremely pleased to be ordered to represent the Chinese government and people in attending the grand coronation ceremony. He wished to take this first opportunity to convey the congratulations of the Chinese people to the British Empire. Sino-British relations have always been friendly and harmonious. In the past few years, China and Britain have had the opportunity to engage in active economic cooperation to seek stability in business and financial situations, which is not only beneficial to both countries but also to the world. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, China has reached a stage of financial balance and political unification, a phenomenon never seen before. Currently, all efforts are concentrated on economic and industrial construction and rural development. In this great work, China welcomes the cooperation of friendly nations. In order to provide my government with the latest materials to assist in advancing the process of economic construction, I intend to inspect and study the economic and industrial development of various European countries after the coronation ceremony is completed. In short, China has felt its responsibility in maintaining peace in the Far East and will surely strive to fulfill its due responsibility. He recalled that he had visited this country five years ago and was very happy. He would like to take this opportunity to renew old friendships and make new acquaintances. We are very pleased to be able to participate in this grand ceremony of the British Empire. Ambassador Guo will host a banquet for Special Envoy Zart and members of the special envoy delegation at the Claridge's Hotel tomorrow evening. British Foreign Secretary Eden, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, and other important British government officials have been invited to attend. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<h3>Tripartite Negotiations Between China, Britain, and Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Dispatch: China to Discuss Abolition of Extraterritoriality with Britain. Ambassador Kawagoe Advises Foreign Minister Sato; Japan Plans to Seize the Opportunity to Bolster Diplomacy and Restore the Political Situation.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] China intends to begin negotiations with various countries to abolish extraterritoriality. The Japanese government, having experienced this during the Meiji Restoration, naturally expresses sympathy for China. However, it believes that the completion of the judicial system is the primary condition for abolishing consular jurisdiction, and that its abolition should proceed gradually. Therefore, if there is a formal proposal from the Chinese government, the policy will be decided with reference to the attitudes of other countries. (Fourth, Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Ambassador Kawagoe visited Foreign Minister Sato on the afternoon of the third, reporting on various incidents that occurred in China after his assumption of office, the content of Sino-Japanese negotiations to resolve these incidents, and the situation in China since the Xi'an Incident. He also made important recommendations regarding the future adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations. He left after an hour. Ambassador Kawagoe plans to meet with the Foreign Minister again in two or three days to exchange views. It is reported that the Ambassador maintains a firm determination regarding the Japanese government's reconsideration of its China policy, so his future words and actions are noteworthy. (Fourth, Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Observers generally believe that the government will seek to achieve some success in domestic and foreign policy before the special session of the Diet convenes in April. There is no doubt that Japan's foreign policy will continue to focus on China. The attitudes of the two major political parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, as well as other parties who previously expressed strong dissatisfaction with Arita's diplomacy, and Ambassador Kawagoe's proposal to establish a clear and unchanging policy toward China, are all important factors in considering future China policy. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Sato Naotake's announcement of the gist of his proposal to Britain and the United States to adjust Sino-Japanese relations is particularly important. In this regard, it is not surprising that Tokyo is paying serious attention to the development of negotiations with London. It is rumored that the door opened to Japan by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, two years ago is still not closed. However, Japan's "political driving force" does not allow it to reach any understanding with Britain on any political issue related to China. At the same time, Japan's current liquidity situation makes it difficult to resume the plan of jointly providing financial and economic assistance to China. Therefore, what can be expected from the London negotiations is no more than ⑴ the easing of the generally bad atmosphere between Britain and Japan, and ⑵ the resolution of the smuggling problem in North China, with Britain mediating to reduce the tariffs China levies on Japanese goods. A Japanese newspaper recently published a prominent article stating that the price Japan paid to improve Sino-Japanese relations was Japan's permission for a concrete guarantee of neutrality in the Philippines, and suggested concluding a Pacific non-aggression treaty on the premise of restoring Sino-Japanese relations to normal. However, this news is unlikely to materialize. As for direct negotiations with China, the general impression is that there is a possibility of restarting them in the near future. Unless the expansion of Japanese industrial and commercial capital in China encounters obstacles, the North China issue, which China highly values, is unlikely to be resolved through Sato's diplomacy. The conservative meaning expressed by the general election results may make any new adventures in North China even more unwelcome to the majority of the people. Maintaining the status quo in North China seems to be the greatest extent to which the army will go. Japan will use this as a basis to try to prevent Britain and the United States from becoming more friendly to China, while continuing to maintain a "wait-and-see" attitude. (Fourth, Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the work of adjusting relations between Britain and Japan, the efforts of the British and Japanese authorities in the past few months have already manifested in facts such as the cancellation of perpetual lease rights and the resolution of the Keelung incident. It is heard that there is also comprehensive and close progress on fundamental issues such as trade issues and cooperation in the Far East. Although the negotiations have not yet left the preliminary work, contact between the Japanese Embassy in London and the British Foreign Office has indeed been quite frequent recently. British officials have also confirmed the above facts and revealed the following opinions today: The British and Japanese authorities are conducting negotiations in order to establish a close relationship between the two countries, which is a fact, but only preliminary negotiations. The basic issues of cooperation have not yet been discussed, but it is believed that the negotiations are promising and can achieve satisfactory results. (Third, Allied Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] A responsible person on the British side recently stated that it is now credible that the Japanese government will soon submit various proposals to Britain in order to improve relations between Britain and Japan and resolve the interests of the respective countries in the Far East. Although Japanese sources here indicate that Japan has no reason to take such action in the near future, it is known to well-informed sources that a certain important Japanese figure recently informed Sir Clive, the British Ambassador to Japan, that the Japanese government is now preparing to submit various proposals to Britain in the near future. At the same time, special instructions will be issued to the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Yoshida Shigeru, to follow. Currently, the Japanese Embassy in London and representatives of the Foreign Ministry have also begun preliminary talks. Japanese sources also acknowledge that the frequent comings and goings between the Japanese Embassy and the Foreign Ministry in recent months are sufficient to indicate that Britain and Japan have shown signs of approaching each other, but said that regarding the China issue, Japan believes that there is no need to make suggestions to Britain, but only for China and Japan to hold direct talks to resolve it. (Central News Agency, Third, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding rumors that British-Japanese cooperation negotiations in China are about to begin, when asked about this matter to Kong Xiangxi, the special envoy who participated in the coronation ceremony of the King of England, Mr. Kong said that he firmly believes that Britain will be able to attach importance to China's interests in considering this matter. Mr. Kong further said that this conversation may be very beneficial. Mr. Kong continued, "There are millions of Chinese residents in the British Empire. They are both loyal people of Britain and filial sons and daughters of China. This is indeed a key that other two countries do not have." When asked if the rumors that his visit to England this time was in hopes of negotiating a loan were true, Kong said, "China's extensive economic development plan is now underway, so international financial cooperation is indeed necessary. As I am in charge of the country's finances, if borrowing abroad is more favorable than raising funds domestically, I will naturally pay attention to its possibility at any time. Beyond that, I cannot say more at this time." Mr. Kong said that when he passed through the capital of the Czech Republic, he had a famous local doctor conduct a full-body examination and found that he had recently suffered from a mild case of valvular enlargement of the heart. Therefore, he plans to go to Bad Homburg, twenty-four miles northeast of Frankfurt on the Main, Germany, for half a year of treatment after his affairs in London are completed. Mr. Kong also said that his daughter recently suffered from an eye disease and has undergone approximately one operation in Prague, after which she should be fine. It is also heard that Mr. Zha will go to Geneva after participating in the coronation ceremony of the King of England to attend the League of Nations meeting on May 26 and intends to convene a meeting of Chinese envoys from various European countries in that place. Furthermore, Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to Britain, hosted a banquet today to welcome the Chinese delegation. Among those invited were British Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Eden, British government economic advisor Frederick Leith-Ross, former British Ambassador to China Cadogan, and many dignitaries from all walks of life.

After visiting Daguanlou and Xishan on the second, Chu said that the lakes and mountains of Daguanlou are beautiful and well-cultivated, which is rare in major cities. The stone chambers of the Sanqing Pavilion in Xishan are truly outstanding scenic spots. People call Xishan the first scenic spot in Yunnan, and after experiencing it personally, it is not an overstatement. On the evening of the third, the Automobile Industry Association welcomed the tour group and inspection transportation teams at the Provincial Party Department. Group member Zhang Denyi explained the advantages of using coal, Zhang Shigang explained the convenience and economy of vegetable oil cars, and Li Jiemin explained the central government's protection and unified management methods for the car industry in various provinces and cities.

Whether the area should belong to Sichuan or Xikang is of great concern to those who are concerned about border affairs. It is learned that the Ministry of Internal Affairs has exchanged written arguments between the two sides, each holding its own reasons, and it is inconvenient to make a rash judgment. It has already replied to the two provinces of Sichuan and Xikang, in accordance with the Provincial, County, and City Boundary Survey Regulations and the Outline of the County Administrative District Planning Method, to draw a map showing the provincial boundary situation of the two provinces of Sichuan and Xikang near Zhuosi Jia and send it to the Ministry for reference.

<h3>National Defense Line (3)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>Several large trucks were parked in the darkness in the courtyard. These were brought over by the puppet troops after their defection. Now, they are preparing to transport the belongings of the defected troops to southern Shanxi. Throughout the night, they kept honking their horns and flashing their lights. People were clamoring, footsteps were shuffling, and miscellaneous objects were constantly clanging. …</p>
<p>I was kept awake all night by the noise. However, I immediately realized: By chance, I happened to encounter Jin Xianzhang's troops heading from Suiyuan to southern Shanxi.</p>
<p>"Is your Division Commander Jin here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"The Division Commander went to Taiyuan today."</p>
<p>I was a little melancholy: I missed an opportunity for a good talk. Listening carefully to the clamorous sounds, I immediately discerned various dialects: Shandong accents, Henan accents, Hebei accents, and occasionally even Northeastern accents. Thinking about the past experiences and encounters of these people: from "bandits" to "National Army," to "scattered bandits," to "puppet troops," to "puppet troops invading Suiyuan," and then to "defected troops." It is indescribable, but today they are standing with us, 450 million compatriots, jointly shouldering the heavy responsibility of saving the country and the nation from peril. In admiration, I felt an indescribable sense of kinship and excitement.</p>
<p>Since their defection last year, which enabled the smooth recovery of Damiao and frightened the enemy, they have been mobilized several times and undergone some training in these past few months. Now, their military discipline is very strict, and all parties are unanimously praising and encouraging them. This time, when Yan Xishan was in Suiyuan, the result of his discussion with senior generals such as Fu Zuoyi was to decide to transfer this part of the defected troops to the southern Shanxi area for further strict training, in order to become an elite force to defend the country and protect the people. Great expectations are placed on them. Tomorrow morning, they will set off for Yangmingbao inside Yanmen Pass, where they will board the trains on the Datong-Puzhou Railway and head straight to southern Shanxi (later, I learned in Taiyuan that their final garrison was in the Jiexiu area). I hope they will keep in mind the expectations of the people of the whole country, the painstaking efforts of the authorities, and their original intention of defection, and move forward on the path of light!</p>
<p>Datong is the first important town in northern Shanxi, a large station on the Ping-Sui Railway, and also a very important key town in our country's long national defense line against Japan in North China. In August last year, the bandit army under Wang Dao once harassed Yanggao, intending to advance on Datong. The main purpose was to occupy this place and cut off the connection between our Suiyuan front line and the rear. If they succeeded, another effect would be to threaten Shanxi and break the Jin-Sui united front. Furthermore, there was an additional effect: if the enemy saw a favorable opportunity, they would return westward from here to attack Suiyuan's rear, heading straight for the Ikezhao League in Suiyuan and reaching the Alxa E'lu'te Banner and Ejina Torghut Banner in Ningxia, thus realizing the enemy's long-held "Great Yuan Empire" conspiracy. At that time, the enemy's special agencies on this route had already existed. By using the method of bandit and puppet troops harassing the area, they would clear the obstacles along the way. Then, the enemy's power would follow, presenting a "when the water comes, the channel is formed" scenario. However, Wang Dao's bandit troops encountered a hard nail on their first attempt and were blocked. Then, the Battle of Suiyuan broke out, and the enemy concentrated its forces and went to Suiyuan East to harass. In the following hundred days, the enemy's westward route changed repeatedly, sometimes focusing on Suiyuan North, sometimes focusing on Suiyuan East, but from beginning to end, the Yanggao and Datong route was always in a tense crisis. Not to mention, if Suiyuan East had unfortunately fallen at that time, then the danger of this route would have become as urgent as the Suiyuan North and Suiyuan East routes. The entire history of the Battle of Suiyuan might have become something else entirely.</p>
<p>From the perspective of connecting the Suiyuan front line and the rear, from the perspective of linking the Jin-Sui provinces' united front, or from the perspective of Datong's own geographical location, Datong is always a key, an important town, and a fortress on our country's national defense line against Japan in North China.</p>
<p>Recently, the authorities have long noticed the importance of this place. Therefore, in the defense line built by Jin and Sui along the Taihang Mountains, passing through Tianzhen, Datong, to Xinghe and Taolin in Suiyuan, Datong is also the most critical location. My original plan this time was not to stay in Datong for more than a few days, but due to various reasons, I had to leave in a hurry. When I met Mr. Li Fuying in Suiyuan, I agreed with him that when I inspected here, I would ask him to provide various conveniences. He readily agreed and expressed his hope that I could see more of Datong; however, this agreement could not be fulfilled at this time.</p>
<p>Later, in Taiyuan, a friend talked to me about Yungang. I told him that I hadn't gone to visit, and he jumped up in surprise and said:</p>
<p>"What! You passed through Datong without visiting Yungang? Then aren't you..."</p>
<p>I understood that he meant that I had wasted my trip to Datong; I shook my head and stopped him, saying: "As long as the territory is preserved, the historical sites can be visited at any time. This time, let's first look at other more important things; as for visiting historical sites, I hope that in the next few years, we can have a more reassuring opportunity than now, and then we can have a purely tourist trip."</p>
<p>We looked at each other with bitterness; even more excited.</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>On the Rumor of Anglo-Japanese Cooperation in China</h3>
<p>The backbone of Japan's China policy is the vigorous implementation of the continental policy. This is something everyone knows. Based on this policy, Japan opposes the intrusion of European and American forces into the Far East and does not want China to get close to countries like Britain and the United States. However, recently, news of Anglo-Japanese cooperation in China has been widely spread in Tokyo and London. The Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun first published on the 21st of last month news that Britain had suggested cooperation with Japan in China. London newspapers also published news that Japan had suggested cooperation with Britain in China, saying that diplomatic representatives of the two countries were now in close contact and that concrete results would soon be seen. The development of this matter has a very significant relationship with our country.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of Anglo-Japanese cooperation, although Japanese newspapers say that the British side first proposed it to Japan, we believe that the initiator of this matter is still in Tokyo. Why would Japan now change its past policy of swallowing China alone and ask Britain to cooperate together? There are very important reasons for this. First, China's unified strength has greatly increased since the peaceful resolution of the Liangguang Incident and the Xi'an Incident last year. Japan can no longer treat us with its previous aggressive policies. Secondly, due to the strengthening of China's unified situation, international relations have also greatly improved. Especially after the Xi'an Incident last year, the relations between Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries and China have undergone major improvements. The formation of this close relationship is the result of Japan's aggressive policy. If Japan does not change its China policy now, then the relations between these peaceful countries will further strengthen. Thirdly, the results of the Japanese parliamentary elections have greatly reduced the government's prestige. The military's aggressive China policy has been unanimously opposed by the Japanese people. Therefore, the Japanese government had no choice but to change its past policy and propose cooperation with Britain in China.</p>
<p>Since Japan's request for British cooperation in China stems from such unavoidable reasons, its ambition for our country will naturally not be completely abandoned. Although the content and conditions of cooperation between the two countries have not yet been concretized, according to various newspapers, they generally include the following points. ㊀ Japan recognizes Britain's existing economic development in central and southern China. ㊁ Britain recognizes Japan's special economic and military strategic interests in North China, but recognition of Manchukuo is not a major condition. ㊂ Britain, the United States, Japan, and France jointly lend money to China. ㊃ China and Japan establish a treaty of friendship. If this kind of cooperation method is fully realized, China will be divided into British and Japanese protectorates.</p>
<p>This kind of proposal by Japan can essentially gain the approval of British political circles because Britain's China policy has always emphasized the expansion of economic power. Previously, British economic envoy Sir Frederick Leith-Ross visited Tokyo twice to try to agree with the Japanese government on a method of cooperation so that Britain's economic interests would not be excessively damaged. However, Leith-Ross's attempt ultimately failed due to the strong attitude of the Japanese military. Now, if Japan can change its policy of swallowing China alone and recognize Britain's special interests in central and southern China, then that is of course what the London government is seeking. However, we cannot make such an optimistic observation of the future of Anglo-Japanese cooperation. Japan's suggestion of cooperation with Britain is only to ease the international atmosphere and alienate Sino-British relations. It has not truly abandoned its continental policy of swallowing China alone. Therefore, if we want Japan to change its China policy and prevent our country from becoming the target of imperialist aggression, then we can only unite as a nation and fight to the death with the aggressors. Apart from this, there seems to be no other way to go.</p>
<h3>The Hayashi Cabinet Practices "Waiting for the Weary Enemy" on Political Parties</h3>
<p>Dissolution and Resignation Determined by the Situation; Planning to Use Three Cabinet Seats as Bait for Party Members</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Foreign Minister Sato stated today that the current situation does not allow the government to proceed with everything according to normal procedures. According to normal procedures, since the opposition party occupies the majority, either the parliament will be dissolved again, or the cabinet will resign, one of them must happen. Each political party does not want to hastily submit an impeachment case against the government to the parliament. Unless they know for sure that the next cabinet's attitude towards political parties opposed to the government is the same as the current cabinet's, they do not want to take this step lightly. The Foreign Minister also mentioned diplomatic issues, saying that Japan's proposal to reduce naval armaments is still too early. He believes that the government should adopt a wait-and-see policy on this matter. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi met with reporters at the Prime Minister's official residence on the evening of the 3rd. Regarding the government's fundamental attitude towards the political situation after the general election and the special parliament, he made the following remarks:</p>
<p>㊀ Measures to deal with the political situation after the general election: After the general election, the government will first study the current cabinet's policies to face the special parliament. Since the current cabinet has no so-called party affiliation, it will never immediately decide to advance or retreat based on the fact that the majority of parliamentarians oppose the government. Before the government listens to the discussions of the parliamentarians in the special parliament, it will not consider the issue of advancing or retreating based on the political parties' opposition to the government or other reasons. When exchanging opinions with the cabinet members in recent days, there was a discussion on the issue of general resignation, but the result was a decision as announced in the Prime Minister's speech on the 3rd. I personally have not considered issues such as general resignation first.</p>
<p>㊁ Attitude towards the special parliament: After the special parliament opens, it is unknown whether the political parties will propose a vote of no confidence. However, the issue of dissolving the parliament again or implementing a general resignation can only be decided after the special parliament opens and judges the situation. The government will judge the parliamentarians' speeches, the political parties' attitudes, and various other situations in the parliament, and if it knows that the newly elected parliamentarians' understanding of the current situation is different from the government's understanding, it can consider dissolving the parliament again.</p>
<p>㊂ Issue of filling vacant cabinet posts: The government plans to appoint cabinet members as soon as possible, that is, to evaluate suitable candidates from all aspects. The Minister of Education, the Minister of Railways, and the Minister of Colonial Affairs will be decided before the 15th. Under the current circumstances, there is no consideration of negotiating with political parties to join the cabinet. My feelings towards the political parties are the same as when the cabinet was formed. I hope that the so-called new party will be established, but I myself am unwilling to actively carry out the work of forming a party. The situation after the general election is such that it is extremely difficult to establish a new party. (Allied News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Seiyukai held its last election committee meeting this morning at Sanentei, with Hatoyama, Maeda, Shimada, Nakajima, and other committee members acting as representatives, and Secretary-General Ando and other members attending. After discussing the party's movements after the general election, the following unanimous opinion was reached: The government has already issued a statement on the 3rd declaring its attachment to power, which has exposed its essence as the embodiment of egoism. Its advance and retreat depend solely on the subjective views of the bureaucrats, and it has reached the extreme of trampling on the general will of the people and violating the constitution. Our party can only continue to "overthrow" it, as we have repeatedly stated, and not allow such a cabinet to continue to exist for even a day. Therefore, in order to decide the party's formal attitude towards the new situation, a general meeting of parliamentarians should be convened. However, in preparation, it was decided to first hold a temporary general affairs meeting and a temporary executive meeting on the 5th. The general meeting of parliamentarians will be held around the 11th. (Allied News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to the Kokumin Shimbun, Prime Minister Hayashi's statement is extremely disagreeable to all political parties and various circles of the House of Peers. They are now urging the cabinet to resign immediately. The Privy Council, which has been observing the political situation from the sidelines, now also harbors anti-government sentiments. At the same time, the Prime Minister's attachment to power can be believed from his answers to reporters' questions. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Negotiate Reciprocal Trade Agreement</h3>
<p>Britain Now Willing to Actively Proceed</p>
<p>[London] Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that there are currently no plans to change the currency agreement concluded between Britain, France, and the United States several months ago. He said that he had not heard of the US Treasury's purchase of 500 million yuan of gold. Britain is currently working closely with the United States and other national governments to maintain the balance of the currency system as much as possible. During the implementation of this policy, it is also necessary to purchase gold when necessary. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>[London] It was learned here today that US envoy Davis had lunch with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain last Monday to exchange views for a long time. It is said that Chamberlain very much wanted to dispel the US side's impression that Britain was deliberately hindering the conclusion of a British-US reciprocal trade agreement and hoped that negotiations on this agreement could proceed soon, but both denied discussing the war debt issue. (Kokumin Daily, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] US envoy Davis met with Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain last week. Well-informed sources recently announced that the two discussed general issues and unanimously agreed that Belgian Prime Minister Janson, entrusted by the British and French governments, is currently investigating the possibility of removing international trade barriers. Before this investigation is completed, all attempts to reduce tariff barriers are futile and useless. In addition, Davis and Chamberlain have agreed that various issues between Britain and the United States, especially commercial issues, will be discussed after the end of the British Imperial Conference. (Central News Agency, Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] Vilett, the former Director of the Information Department of the Foreign Office and former US correspondent of The Times, recently published an article in the newspaper discussing the mutual reduction of tariffs between Britain and the United States, stating that Britain and the United States are currently conducting negotiations on the establishment of a commercial agreement. The Democratic Party currently in power in the United States has always advocated reducing import duties and promoting free trade policies. It has already promised to reduce tariffs on certain British manufactured and semi-manufactured products. This is all that can be told to readers at present. As for the extent to which the US government can promote the freedom of international trade, the main key lies in the extent to which the economic nationalism of various countries can be rejected. (China-UK Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: Belgian financial expert Fraer, under the order of Belgian Prime Minister Janson, went to various countries to investigate possible ways to break down international trade barriers, and has arrived in the Netherlands.

<h3>The Duke of Windsor and Mrs. Simpson Reunite in a French Villa After a Long Separation</h3>
<p>Met in the Villa's Study for a Few Minutes; Secret Travel, Wedding Date Undecided</p>
<p>Mengzhi, France: The Duke of Windsor met with Mrs. Simpson today at the Gondé villa outside of here. The Duke of Windsor took a special train from Salzburg, Austria, to a small station in Vanneuy, 31 miles outside of Paris, and then changed to a pre-arranged car to travel south. The car traveled at about 60 miles per hour, with four police motorcycles leading the way, followed closely by three cars carrying detectives and others. Twelve British and French detectives were stationed in shifts at the iron gate of the villa, prohibiting idlers from entering. According to intelligence, the Duke and Mrs. Simpson met in the villa's study and only spent a few minutes before meeting and chatting with the residents. Then they had lunch together and sat on the balcony to rest. (Kokumin Daily, 4th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Duke of Windsor will probably hold a wedding ceremony with Mrs. Simpson at the Gondé villa. When the Duke got off the train, Mrs. Simpson's car was waiting outside the station, but Mrs. Simpson stayed at the Gondé villa. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Tours, France: The former British King, Duke of Windsor, arrived at the Gondé villa here at 1:35 pm today in a Canadian-made large car, followed closely by a car carrying detectives and cinematographers. Along the way, there were six policemen escorting on motorcycles. When the Duke got off the train at the small station in Vanneuy, his movements were extremely secret, and very few people knew about it. Only ten photographers, who had followed him from Austria in the same car, saw the Duke get off the train and immediately jumped out to surround him. Onlookers watched silently, and wireless broadcasters reported the Duke's actions on the radio for broadcast. Mrs. Simpson's friend Rogers recently announced that the Duke of Windsor is now a guest at the Bitaud couple's villa in Gondé and plans to stay for a few days. The wedding date has not yet been decided. (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Salzburg: The former British King, Duke of Windsor, left here this afternoon on a fast train with a beloved dog. He will arrive in Paris tomorrow morning. The Austrian police department followed the car to the Austrian border at that time, and the Austrian chauffeur also followed. The Duke of Windsor drove his own car to Salzburg, and another car carried his luggage, including eight huge boxes, two golf bags, and several small suitcases. The Duke of Windsor wore a light gray coat and a black hard felt hat, and was in very good spirits. He arrived here four minutes before the train arrived. His travel schedule was kept strictly secret, so his departure was very quiet. Only the stationmaster, an Austrian official, saw him off. The Duke of Windsor waved to him with a smile. (China-UK Agency, Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Paris] People in Mengzhi, France, were very excited and enthusiastic after learning that the Duke of Windsor would visit Mrs. Simpson at the Gondé villa near Tours. Reporters and photographers arrived from all directions one after another. The remaining houses in the village and the surrounding county were fully booked, and countless special telephone and telegraph lines were set up between there and Tours to ensure that the news could be sent all over the world as soon as the Duke of Windsor arrived.

<h3>The Vatican Responds to German Protest</h3>
<p>Vatican: Pope Pius XI issued an encyclical on March 21 criticizing Germany for violating the 1933 Concordat. The German government protested to the Vatican. The Vatican sent a reply to the German Ambassador, Fershan, today. Although Church officials are keeping silent about the contents of the reply, well-informed sources say that this reply will definitely point to the recent remarks made by German leader Hitler, which were used to oppose Catholicism. The fact that the Vatican's reply was sent when German Foreign Minister Neurath was visiting Rome is also quite meaningful. (Central News Agency, Havas, 4th)</p>
<h3>Two American Billionaires Accused of Evading Income Tax</h3>
<p>[New York] Business tycoons Shebon and Rysco (President and Vice President of American Constant Color Company) were accused of underpaying income tax in 1929. According to the authorities, the two had bought and sold all their securities and stocks to each other, claiming to have suffered losses in 1929 to evade income tax. DuPont paid US$617,316, and Rysco owed US$1,026,340. Today, the two went to the Tax Appeals Board to explain that this sale was legal. As for buying and selling to each other instead of doing it in the open market, it was because the securities market was very sluggish in 1929, and they did not want to make the market even worse.

<h3>Italian Press Denies Military Alliance Between Germany and Italy</h3>
<p>Neurath and Mussolini Hold a Long Conversation; Göring Again Active in Yugoslavia; Hungary Still Supports the German-Italian Axis</p>
<p>[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath visited Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon and held talks for approximately two hours. Count Ciano, the Foreign Minister, was also present. (Havas Agency dispatch from Rome, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] German Foreign Minister Neurath visited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon and held a one-and-a-half-hour long conversation. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present. It is reported that the talks were extremely amicable. The newspapers here warmly welcomed the German Foreign Minister's visit, believing it further confirms the friendly relations between the two countries. The Italian News listed the importance of German-Italian cooperation and its impact on the European political situation, emphasizing that the German-Italian axis neither divides the world in two nor hinders European peace efforts, but rather serves as a tool for communication between the two sides. As for foreign reports that the purpose of the German Foreign Minister's visit was to conclude a military agreement, the newspaper strongly denied this, saying that such rumors had already been circulating when Göring and von Blomberg visited Italy some time ago, and that they were completely groundless. (National Maritime Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] Immediately upon arriving here this morning, German Foreign Minister Neurath held talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia, lasting for 75 minutes. According to reliable sources, the two discussed the general European situation. However, the Spanish issue and the German-Italian axis were also discussed. Furthermore, it is claimed by authoritative sources that there is nothing alarming in the German-Italian talks. The Austrian issue was also discussed again. It is said that both sides acknowledged that it would be very difficult to successfully resolve the Danube River issue without unified cooperation between the two countries. Regarding the Western European agreement, Germany and Italy will proceed along a common path, but they do not intend to seek a quick resolution until the Spanish issue is resolved. (Reuters dispatch from Rome, 3rd)</p>
<p>[Rome] Responsible figures here recently stated that both sides made clarifications on the following three issues: ❶ Italy and Germany reaffirmed their willingness to respect the territorial integrity of Spain, but only on the condition that the Soviet Union does not use any pretext to extend its influence in the Mediterranean. ❷ The political axis formed by Italy and Germany is the pivot for the peaceful improvement of the European situation, and all countries are welcome to participate. ❸ Italy and Germany have no plans to form a military alliance or agreement. King Victor Emmanuel III received Foreign Minister Neurath at the Quirinal Palace at 8:00 AM this morning for a half-hour meeting. Subsequently, they went together to the Massimo Palace to preside over the opening ceremony of the German Science Museum. Neurath then returned to the German Embassy for lunch and is scheduled to hold a second conversation with Prime Minister Mussolini in the afternoon. In the evening, Foreign Minister Ciano will host a banquet for him at a villa in the suburbs. (Havas Agency dispatch via Sino-British News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The semi-official Italian newspaper, "Il Giornale d'Italia," recently published an article by the well-known journalist Gayda, discussing the visit of German Foreign Minister Neurath, stating, "If the Spanish issue continues to exist, then seeking a solution to the appeasement of Western Europe will be untimely." It also stated that neither Germany nor Italy seeks territorial or political interests in Spain; their sole purpose is to preserve Spain "so that the communist revolutionary movement instigated by foreign countries cannot gain a foothold there."

<p>Capital of Hungary. After Austrian President Miklas arrived here, Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy hosted a banquet at the Royal Palace last night, and in his speech stated, "The Rome Protocols are indeed the linchpin of our two countries' foreign policy, have already produced good results, and have become the most important factor in the construction projects of the Danube River basin. The establishment of good relations between Hungary and the powerful German Empire is an especially auspicious sign for the future. It is hoped that the friendship between Austria and Hungary will become the cornerstone of peaceful development for both sides." President Miklas responded by saying, "Austria and Hungary share the same interests and are therefore united and have restored their original strength, sufficient to solve the major problems currently facing us. As we pursue a policy of peace and strive to safeguard freedom and national self-determination, Italy will surely provide practical support, and Germany will also maintain friendly relations with us. It is my belief that this is an important guarantee for the peaceful development of Austria, Hungary, and the countries of the Danube River basin." (Havas Agency dispatch from Rome, 4th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] After returning to Germany from Italy, General Göring visited Yugoslavia en route. Prince Paul, the Regent of that country, hosted a banquet for him at Bled. Political circles speculate that various issues between Yugoslavia and Hungary have been discussed, and that the issue of ethnic minorities was also a subject of negotiation. It is indicated here that General Göring and Prince Paul have had very close personal relations for many years, so this visit should not be considered to have special political significance.

<h3>Hollywood Labor Strike Worsens</h3>
<p>Makeup Studio Destroyed, Filming Continues as Usual</p>
<p>Hollywood. Striking film industry workers rioted today. A number of union workers, armed with hammers, vandalized the Westmore Beauty and Makeup Studio, jointly operated by two major Hollywood studios, causing approximately US$10,000 in damages. According to union leaders, the studio had been supplying non-union replacement workers to various film studios. The Westmore Beauty and Makeup Studio is managed by the Westmore brothers, who also serve as the heads of the makeup departments for Warner Bros., 20th Century Fox, and Paramount, three major film companies. Lessing, the acting chairman of the Film Workers Union, announced that he had sent a letter to Green, the chairman of the American Federation of Labor, protesting the strike-breaking attitude of the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, an affiliated organization. He has also requested support from the Los Angeles labor unions to be a precursor to a total strike of all studios. The employers have dispatched four representatives to negotiate terms with the Screen Actors Guild, including the recognition of the union. (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>Hollywood. Six thousand film technicians and others in Hollywood are still on strike. A thousand pickets are stationed in front of the nine major film production companies, patrolling back and forth. However, filming work is still proceeding as usual. According to Smith, the chairman of the strike committee, the companies are sending many makeup artists and other workers into the studios at night when there are fewer pickets. Production at Pathé was delayed because someone had stuffed matchsticks into the door locks of the office building. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 4th)</p>
<p>Hollywood. Pickets are still stationed in front of the studios of the ten major film companies today. However, the stars of the studios are able to pass through safely. It is reported that the strikers have been photographing actors passing through the picket lines so that they can be publicized and labeled as "anti-union elements." (National Telegram, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Crowded Streets in London</h3>
<p>Bus Workers Toil Hard; Working Hours Should be Reduced</p>
<p>[London] The London bus strike inquiry tribunal began its investigation today. Bevan, the general secretary of the Transport and General Workers' Union and the leader of the strike, stated to the tribunal today that London's traffic problems are constantly changing and progressing. Consequently, the mental strain on bus drivers is increasing daily. Furthermore, the lives of these drivers are unregulated, with irregular eating and sleeping habits, which greatly affect the workers' health. The Institute of Industrial Hygiene has been investigating this matter for several years. The union feels that since work on the streets of London is tense and the workers' health is affected by it, it cannot stand idly by. Therefore, reducing working hours is a method of reducing this adverse impact. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>[London] Today is the third day of the London bus strike. The citizens of London have not changed their calm demeanor as a result. In the early morning, citizens going to work have switched to trams or underground railways, while others are walking to their destinations. In addition, the weather is clear today, so there are even more pedestrians. The sidewalks are extremely crowded, and taxis are flowing continuously in the middle of the road. Those who usually park on the streets to solicit business are now carrying passengers and are overwhelmed with customers. Even old, unused cars that have been idle for some time are filling the streets. There are also many people renting bicycles. The famous London bicycle merchant, Willis Company, is experiencing a tenfold increase in business, the greatest prosperity since the general strike of 1926. Representatives of the Central Committee recently announced that the strikers do not intend to have tram drivers and ticket sellers join the strike while the city's Transportation Bureau investigation committee is conducting its investigation. However, if private car companies operate temporary services to replace buses, this will be considered a provocative act that could cause disruption. The city's Transportation Bureau has now ordered tram companies and underground railway companies not to take the opportunity to increase the number of passenger vehicles in order to avoid undermining the bus strike.

<h3>Gleanings from Yunnan Travel (6)</h3>
<p>— Bei Quan</p>
<p>The Thirteenth Day (April 17th), Rain. Traveled thirty kilometers from Changde to Taohuayuan. The path wound tortuously along the entrance of the peach blossom forest, climbing up the steps. About two li to the cave entrance, there was an old stele of "Qin People's Ancient Cave," and "Below is Wenjin Pavilion." There were inscriptions from the Jin, Sui, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. Beside it, there was an ancient well that never dried up despite drought. To the right was Guanyin Hall with five rooms, enshrining Tao Yuanming. Peonies in the courtyard were blooming vigorously, said to be three hundred years old. The inner eight scenic spots and outer eight scenic spots were all seen in the notes, so they are not recorded here. There were many couplets in the hall, but they were too verbose and uninteresting. Only Yang Ruihan's couplet, "The rise and fall of Qin and Han are consigned to the flowing stream, the news of immortals is asked from peach blossoms," was quite transcendent. According to records, Peach Blossom Spring has been mentioned since Tao Yuanming's account, Wang Wei's "Peach Blossom Spring Journey," Li Bai's preface, and Han Yu's "Song of Peach Blossom Spring." Many literati throughout history have composed poems about it. Today, ascending to this place, although the cave source is less than three xun (a Chinese unit of length), and the environment is not as described in the past, it is still rich in historical significance and worth lingering for a while. County Magistrate Liu of Taoyuan County died of intestinal fever and typhoid fever last night. Many people in the market town are suffering from typhoid fever because there is only one Catholic hospital on East Street, with only one doctor. The total population of Taoyuan County is over 540,000. There are two newspapers, "People's Voice News" and "Popular News."</p>
<p>Arrived at Cha'anpu at noon. Some villagers were selling Beijing-style goods, stationery, jade bracelets, Boshan refined crystal, and Nanyang stone seals, emptying their old stock. They were selling under the reputation of Taoyuan stones, but only the pebbles were actually produced locally. Then entered the mountain, winding and turning to 950 meters (above sea level), at the foot of the "Xuefeng Mountain" range. People in the car felt tired. This journey passed through such a winding road in Huangshan, and now reaching Xuefeng is the second time. Arrived in Yuanling in the evening. First watched Miao girls drumming at "Fubo Pavilion," then crossed the river to watch Miao people dancing the lion dance, lively and exquisite, unmatched by lion dance performers from other places. Secretary Shi Honggui of the Special Commissioner's Office, a graduate of Wenhua University, is an outstanding member of the Miao ethnic group and has contributed greatly to the communication of culture and feelings between the local Han and Miao people. Another Mr. Shi led a Miao martial arts troupe to perform Miao sword, Miao spear, meteor hammer, steel fork, and other techniques. However, these are all ancient Chinese martial arts that have been passed down among the Miao people and are now generally regarded as Miao customs.</p>
<p>The total population of Yuanling County is over 240,000. The market is quite prosperous. Many Guizhou merchants do business here because goods can be transported directly to Zhenyuan via the Yuanshui and Fushui rivers. Each day, special goods are transported in bulk from Yunnan and Guizhou to Hunan by several or more than ten trucks. Therefore, there are also around four hundred entertainment houses, and they have caretakers and education, the team is orderly, and the uniforms are all light blue bamboo cloth shirts led by an electrical official. There are many roadside inns with newly built three-story buildings, which shows that western Hunan, after the banditry, has a prosperous market, and "opium" and "prostitution" also contribute considerably.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of national unity, it seems unnecessary to establish a separate society for the Miao people or to make excessive publicity about them. It should be understood that we are different from foreigners who come to China for archaeology. This time, the Hunan government specially gathered Miao people to showcase various skills, which, although intended to promote them, seemed to have some unnatural feelings involved. According to investigations, there are about 400,000 Miao people in the five counties of western Hunan, while there are more than 2 million Miao people in Guizhou, accounting for more than one-third of the province's population. Adding the Miao people in Guangxi, Sichuan, southern Jiangxi, and Yunnan, the total number should be over 10 million. Now that they are all listed as common people and moving forward under the same Qing Bai flag, the boundaries should become more blurred. It seems unnecessary to be driven by curiosity to take photos of Miao girls and appreciate Miao people dancing.</p>
<p>The Fourteenth Day (April 18th), departed from Yuanling and went to Chenxi along the Yuan River. Crossed the Yuan River and arrived at "Danshan Temple." The temple was built on a mountain peak on a cliff, even more steep and lofty than Xiaogu Pudu and Jiaoshan. Wang Yangming passed by and had a poem inscribed, which made it famous. When we, sixteen people in the car, departed from Nanchang, we formed a cooperative for travel needs, with Mr. Zeng Shirong in charge. Mr. Zeng and Mr. Zeng Shiying, who created maps for Shenbao, are brothers and look exactly alike. On the first day, I almost mistook Shirong for Shiying. Mr. Zeng is the director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Transportation Office and represents the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in this trip, so we have no lack of supplies along the way.</p>
<p>Arrived in Chenxi at noon. Chenxi is located in the mountains, with inconvenient transportation. Residents eat rice at fifteen yuan per dan (a Chinese unit of weight). It was unexpected for us that rice is so expensive in Hunan, a rice-producing area. There are two coal mines attached to the city, one is Huimin and the other is a joint venture. Workers are hired to mine coal, often four or five hundred people using foreign labor system. Delivering a dan of coal earns 280 wen, and each person earns about six or seven jiao per day with their best effort. Many female workers transport coal in the mine, earning about three jiao a day. Chenxi has many mountains and rocks and very little farmland. What little there is can only be planted with sweet potatoes and buckwheat. Now, Huimin Mine has purchased machinery for expansion, but it is still too early to talk about all the equipment in the mine. Chenxi mountains produce Chen oranges, about 70,000 dan per year. The color is golden yellow, quite similar to American San Francisco oranges, and they are very juicy, but slightly sour. If cultivation is promoted, it could also be a local source of productivity. Women in Chenxi carry children in baskets on their backs. This method is very unphysiological. In hot weather, carrying a child and carrying a child means that the body heat of both adults and children is transmitted to each other, which is extremely unhygienic. Now, in Chenxi, children stand in bamboo baskets and are carried on the back, which is very convenient. Also, in the Yuan River in Chenxi, it is common to see boats with waterwheels on both sides and a mill in the middle, grinding flour for people. This boat uses water power instead of manpower and can move around. It can be called "mobile water mill," which is also a reasonable invention. Tao Guang, the commander of the 28th Army, is stationed in western Hunan. Tao and Mr. He Sui were old colleagues in the Guangxi Training Office. Together with Chairman He Yunqiao, they asked Mr. He Sui and Mr. Zheng Yue for several paintings to commemorate their visit. Arrived in Zhijiang in the evening. The city streets of Zhijiang run in four directions, east, west, south, and north, with the drum tower in the center. The total population of the county is 190,000. There are over 7,400 registered opium smokers, and also over a hundred entertainment houses.</p>
<h3>Record of Our Country's Special Envoy Delegation to the UK to Attend the Coronation of the British King</h3>
<p>Impressions of Singapore</p>
<p>Colombo Dispatch: The Victoria mail ship carrying the Chinese delegation to the UK to celebrate the coronation of the British King arrived in Singapore at 9:00 AM on April 9th. Welcoming them at the pier were Consul General Gao Lingbai and representatives from 138 Chinese community organizations, with four representatives from each organization. They all held national flags and stood on the pier, waiting for Special Envoy Kong and the delegation to disembark. After everyone disembarked, they took more than a hundred cars prepared by the Chinese community to the Consulate General, rested briefly, and then went to visit Wan Qing Yuan. According to locals, Premier Sun Yat-sen established the Tongmenghui here, and the Blue Sky White Sun flag was created here. The garden covers several acres, with a building in the middle that is now dilapidated. The building has no roof and cannot shield from wind and rain. The compatriots here have collected five thousand dollars to buy this place to commemorate the Premier. Recently, the Central Government has decided to allocate 15,000 yuan to renovate this garden. In the future, all compatriots passing through Singapore should come here to pay their respects.</p>
<p>After taking photos at Wan Qing Yuan, Special Envoy Kong first gave a short public speech at the Tongde Newspaper and Bookstore at the invitation of Kuomintang comrades. Then, he went to the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to participate in the welcome rally for the Chinese community. At this time, the venue inside and outside and the surrounding areas were full of welcoming people. When Special Envoy Kong's car arrived, everyone applauded. In his speech at the welcome rally, Special Envoy Kong praised the past achievements of the Singaporean Chinese community and encouraged them to unite sincerely and work hard to develop their own businesses and seek the revival of the motherland. Finally, Special Envoy Kong said that China's efforts in recent years have established a foundation for prosperity and strength. The specific facts will be explained separately by Secretary-General Weng. Special Envoy Kong and Deputy Envoy Chen had already agreed to visit the Singapore naval base with the British naval authorities, so they bid farewell after the speech, but the welcome rally continued. Secretary-General Weng briefly described China's construction in various aspects in the past few years, including detailed explanations of highways, railways, light industry, heavy industry, etc., which gave great comfort to the overseas Chinese who care about their motherland.</p>
<p>The British have spent 50 million US dollars to build Singapore's naval base, and it is still under construction. The British regard this as a forbidden area and prohibit outsiders from visiting. This time, when Special Envoy Kong passed through Singapore, the British authorities specially invited him to visit, which shows that the friendship between China and Britain is beyond superficial relations.</p>
<p>After visiting the naval base, the British Governor specially hosted a banquet to welcome Special Envoy Kong, Deputy Envoy Chen, Secretary-General Weng, and various counselors. The rest of the people went to the Singapore Daily to participate in the Bank of China's banquet, which was held at the Nantian Restaurant. After eating Western food on the ship for several days, they were all overjoyed to suddenly eat an authentic Chinese meal. The owner of the Nantian Restaurant is said to be an overseas Chinese, but he has become very indifferent to his motherland after being overseas for many years. During the European War, he personally helped the British with an airplane, but he has not contributed to the construction of the Chinese air force. What methods do we have to reignite their enthusiasm for the motherland for such overseas Chinese? This is a question that those who care about overseas Chinese education should consider.</p>
<p>The wealthy Singaporean merchants, the Hu Wenhu and Hu Wenbao brothers who made their fortune with Tiger Balm, also held a tea party at 3:00 PM to welcome Special Envoy Kong and the delegation. The event was held at the Haw Par Villa in Pasir Panjang. This villa was recently completed and is said to have cost 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. We rarely see such magnificent buildings in the country. Although we have been away from Shanghai for more than a week, passing through many British and American territories, everyone seems to still be traveling in the country, especially in Singapore. Most of the people seen on the streets are Chinese, and there are Chinese shops and Chinese signs. It turns out that four-fifths of the population of Singapore are Chinese. According to business people here, Singapore's economic foundation is built on two commodities: rubber and tin. In the depression era four or five years ago, rubber sold for only five or six yuan per hundred catties, but now it sells for sixty yuan per hundred catties. A few years ago, tin was only worth twenty yuan per dan, but now it sells for more than one hundred yuan (all calculated in local currency). Therefore, people doing business in Singapore this year are very profitable. Overseas Chinese who make a living here have surplus money to send back. According to representatives from the Bank of China, the amount of money remitted back to China by overseas Chinese through the bank from July to December last year was about 15 to 16 million, and in the first three months of this year, 7 to 8 million has already been remitted back. Under this kind of prosperity, the local government has also relaxed restrictions on Chinese immigration. Previously, only 4,000 people were allowed to enter each month, but now it has increased to 6,000, and it is expected to increase to 7,000 soon.</p>
<p>Singapore is a world of overseas Chinese. We only felt like we had truly left China when we left Singapore.</p>

<p>Over 200,000 Patients in a Population of 500,000; Annual Medical Expenses Reach 3.5 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: According to an investigation released by the Health Section of the pseudo-Police Department, approximately 7,000 patients in Harbin City's population of 500,000 were treated by traditional Chinese medicine practitioners in the past two months, and approximately 202,000 were treated by Western medicine practitioners. In addition, it is estimated that there are as many as 20,000 Korean patients. That is to say, almost half of the city's population of 500,000 is sick. Furthermore, statistics show that the average medical expense per patient is 10 yuan, and the annual medical expense in the city exceeds 3.5 million yuan. These are all shocking figures. As for the diseases contracted, tuberculosis is roughly the most prevalent, and respiratory diseases, digestive diseases, injuries, and venereal diseases are also not uncommon.</p>
<h3>United Match Manufacturing Association Assigns Ueda to Qingdao to Mediate Disputes</h3>
<p>Shandong Factory Representatives Fight for Survival; A Small Group Will Be Organized for Mediation Meetings</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: The dispute between the Shandong-Henan Area Match Industry Joint Office and the United Match Production and Sales Association has persisted for years without resolution. It is now learned that the Shanghai United Association has specially dispatched Mr. Ueda, a director and deputy manager of the association, to Qingdao from Jinan on the 28th of last month. He went to the Shandong Area Unified Tax Bureau to negotiate, stating that he was willing to negotiate with the factories that had not joined the United Association with sincerity and requested the bureau to assist him. The bureau immediately convened a meeting of representatives from both sides in the bureau's auditorium at 9:00 AM on May 2nd. Those present included: from the Unified Tax Bureau, Director Tang, Section Chief Wang, and Section Chief Zhao; from the Joint Office, representatives from 20 factories including Huabei, Luxi, and Yuhe; and from the United Association, Director Ueda, translator Liu Qinghong, Chairman Cong Dezi of the Qingdao branch, and Secretary Zhuang Yan. Director Tang first reported the significance of convening today's meeting and the bureau's position, and urged the factories of the Joint Office to set aside their prejudices, negotiate openly, and join the association as soon as possible to avoid a stalemate between the two sides, which would be detrimental to both sides, and also to restore the state of national tax revenue. Then, Ueda stated that he was a third party acting as a mediator to resolve the dispute in the match industry, hoping that the dispute would be settled as soon as possible so that the United Association could operate smoothly and the entire match industry could achieve common existence, prosperity, and welfare. He said that all provinces have joined the United Association, but the 20 factories in your area have not yet joined, and he hoped to eliminate misunderstandings, join as soon as possible, and jointly develop the industry. Next, Deng Songping, the representative of the Joint Office, put forward the common opinions of the factories, briefly stating that the opinions of the factories in this office can be summarized as fighting for survival. Broadly speaking, the articles of association were drafted secretly by a small number of manufacturers and submitted to the government for the record, forcing all manufacturers to join the association and abide by the articles of association, which is unfair in principle. First, foreign merchants were specially allowed to increase production by more than 100,000 cases outside the unified tax records, while our Shandong Chinese factories were subject to a 30% discount on the recorded amount and were restricted and eliminated. If the International Factory only produces one case per day, how can it survive? Second, the share capital is set at 5 million. What is it used for, and what guarantees are there? Furthermore, Shandong factories have limited capital and cannot afford unlimited share capital, making it difficult to continue. Third, the annual expenses are over one million, and there are redundant personnel who waste money, more than a government office. It is directly supplied by the factories, which indirectly increases the burden on the people. It should be clearly defined as an honorary position, with expenses for transportation and meals provided for office work. Fourth, the selection of personnel without an open election by the general meeting of shareholders is already illegal, and moreover, it was secretly agreed upon by a small number of manufacturers and foreign parties as early as September of the 24th year of the Republic. Fifth, the resolutions of the general meeting of shareholders are resolved by the board of directors, and the voting rights of the general meeting of shareholders are calculated according to the production ratio, which are all illegal and unauthorized, causing many abuses. These are roughly the main points. Please consider the detailed written reasons. For a year, we have repeatedly requested but have not been understood. The so-called permission to increase the production of small factories is still a matter of taking from our 20 factories to patch up the holes, which is too ridiculous and the method is close to division. Finally, Ueda proposed organizing a small group for mediation meetings, with representatives elected by both sides for discussion. Both sides strongly agreed. The number of representatives will be determined after returning, and then notified. The meeting location was chosen to be the National Federation of Industries. After the meeting date is agreed upon, a telephone notification will be made. It is expected that after this small group mediation meeting, the dispute that has not been resolved for years may be settled.</p>

<h3>Sui Border Pseudo-Army Units Appear in Border Villages</h3>
<p>The Purpose is to Disrupt the Defense Army and Plunder Horses and Property</p>
<p>Zhangbei Dispatch: Recently, there has been a rumor that a certain party has transported a large number of heavy weapons such as tanks to Nanhaoqian from the Rehe area and has ordered the pseudo-army to advance westward, and that the pseudo-army has attacked Sui-East Xinghe and Jining. Judging from the actual situation in Chahar North, this is not entirely true. The information obtained from relevant parties is described below:</p>
<p>From around 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM on the night of April 28th, gunshots and artillery sounds occurred near Nanhaoqian. Also, on consecutive days, intermittent gunshots occurred in various places along the border. According to reliable reports, on the evening of April 28th, about 20 soldiers from Liu Jiguang's unit of the pseudo-army's First Division took advantage of the dim night to sneak near Nanhaoqian, attempting to break in and plunder while the villagers were unprepared. They were discovered by the local security group and immediately fiercely attacked. The defense army heard the sounds and fired cannons to support the security group. The pseudo-army gained nothing and retreated in defeat. The reason is that most of the pseudo-army are cavalry, with a shortage of horses and even fewer possessions. Therefore, they often form small groups of two, three, or ten to appear in villages and towns along the Sui-East border, with the sole purpose of obtaining horses and plundering property. The pseudo-party also believes that allowing the pseudo-soldiers to plunder along the Sui border can also disrupt the national army's defense, so they allow them to do as they please. This is why gunshots have been occurring continuously recently.</p>
<p>This kind of action by the pseudo-army is like the provocative behavior before the past two offenses against Sui, and they are still using their old tricks, so it is worth paying attention to. Fortunately, the Shanxi-Hebei defense army has made sufficient preparations, and the pseudo-party's disturbances are unrelated to the overall situation. As for the pseudo-party's army, apart from occasional troop movements, there has been no increase in troops to the front line, and the military officers sent by a certain party to monitor and guide the pseudo-army have now completely withdrawn, indicating a clear distrust of the pseudo-army. In this situation, it is difficult to transport heavy weapons such as tanks to the front line, and these weapons have already been withdrawn successively after the national army recovered Bailing Temple and Damaozi. At most, they will be transported to western Rehe to wait for an opportunity to launch.</p>
<p>However, a certain party in Dolon lacks an airfield and is now actively expanding the construction. In the past, a certain party thought that Sui-Bao could be taken in one fell swoop, so the airfields in Zhangbei, Shangdu, and Jiabusi were carefully constructed as a base. Therefore, they did not pay much attention to the Dolon airfield. When they met with setbacks in the westward advance, they realized that the Dolon airfield was rudimentary and there was a real need to expand it. In recent days, a certain party has been stepping up the construction of barracks, warehouses, dormitories, etc. Judging from the current situation, it is unlikely that they will launch a pseudo-army westward advance in the near future. (One day)</p>
<h3>New Business of Taiwanese in Fuzhou</h3>
<p>After Opium Dens Closed, They Changed to Running Usury; Selling Inferior Goods and Occupying the Market</p>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Most Taiwanese living in Fuzhou make a living by opening opium dens, with no fewer than three hundred in the city. For twenty years, they have caused no small harm to society. Recently, because our country has been strictly prohibiting opium, the provincial government has repeatedly made representations to the Japanese Consul in Fujian. The Japanese Consul finally agreed that from March 1st, only 100 opium dens would be allowed to be opened by Taiwanese, and the other Taiwanese who opened opium dens would be ordered to change to other businesses. Those who lack capital would be allowed to borrow money from the Taiwan Association's financial cooperative. After the closure of those foreign-branded opium dens, most of them changed to running usury (called "daily cut" in Fuzhou). The method is to stipulate that each loan is from five yuan to fifty yuan. For example, if you borrow five yuan, you only pay four yuan and five jiao. Starting from the third day, you must pay back five jiao every day, which must be paid off in ten days. If you are in arrears for three days, you will be fined for one day. If you cannot pay, the guarantor will be responsible for paying on your behalf. As a result, in the past month, there have been many signs of "Financial Loan from So-and-So Foreign Firm" on the street. At first, the borrowers were still laborers, so the loans were not very large. Recently, however, merchants below the middle class have also borrowed money from them to alleviate their urgent needs due to poor turnover, and they often borrow from more than one company. As a result, each store often owes five or six hundred yuan to six or seven hundred yuan in principal and interest on foreign debts, making it impossible to repay on a daily basis. Either the goods are moved away and the store closes, or they go bankrupt and flee. In recent days, the Da Xiang Leather Shoe Store and the Guangming Glasses and Clock Store on South Street have all gone bankrupt due to owing too much to those foreign debts. The papers posted in front of their stores all state that the store owes so-and-so foreign firm a certain amount of money. A part of the closed foreign-branded opium dens have changed to running special trade. The goods they sell are mainly silk and satin, seafood, and goods from Jiangsu and Guangdong, mostly inferior goods from a certain country transported from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Because they are cheap, they are very popular. Just taking silk and satin as an example, they are all made of rayon. The wholesale price for foreign firms is only about one jiao and five fen per foot, but the silk and cloth shops sell them to customers for two jiao to three jiao or more, with very high profits. Compared to the cost of domestic Jiangzhe machine-made silk and satin, which is at least five jiao per foot, the difference is huge. Although this kind of goods is not as durable as our country's silk and satin and is commonly called "one-year new," its patterns are novel, its colors are bright, and its price is cheap, so there are many buyers and sales are fast, making it extremely popular. At this time, when spring is late and the weather is warm, and it is the time for people to change clothes, the cloth shops are holding big sales, decorating with lanterns and streamers, and business is very lively. However, what is displayed in their shops is all kinds of inferior rayon goods from a certain country, and no one cares about real silk and satin. Silk and cloth brokers see that these inferior goods are profitable and rush to buy and hoard them from Taiwanese foreign firms to sell to silk and cloth shops later. Therefore, the Fuzhou silk and cloth market has been dominated by goods from a certain country.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Seven Temples Go to Dongyue Sheng Hui</p>
<p>On the 28th day of the third lunar month, which has been abolished, it is the biggest incense festival in Wuxi. Temples in the city traditionally hold a grand event to go to Dongyue. Now they are preparing separately to compete. There are seven temples participating. The Beidang Fu Temple uses 56 horses and has more than 20 kinds of opera performances. There are also night lights, yarn flags, and yarn umbrellas. The Lihua Village Yansheng Temple uses 41 horses and has more than 10 opera performances and also has night lights.

The remaining three temples, Xishuixian, Nan Shuixian, and Old Temple, also have characteristic ceremonial guards.</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation of Disk Losses</p>
<p>The county government was ordered to clean up the booklets of land tax from the years of 1927 to 1935. It was discovered that Zhu Kaiguan, the former director of land tax, had a deficit of up to ninety thousand yuan. A telegram was immediately sent to inform him to quickly find a way to clean it up. Zhu is currently the assistant of the Shanghai fish market, so he sent his student, Yuan, to Wuxi to get around and also to sell his newly built house in Donggulou, to show that there is no money available. The county party headquarters has repeatedly received complaints and has already sent a letter to the county government to investigate the truth, and the county farmers association feels that the inside story is complex, the rumors are rampant, and the public sentiment is angry. Yesterday, it presented the county party headquarters to the provincial party headquarters to request the provincial government to investigate.</p>

<p>Chambers of Commerce Request Tax Reduction</p>
<p>The local Chamber of Commerce, considering that the business tax bureau has been increasing tax rates year by year and merchants are unable to bear the burden, has not only submitted a request to the Department of Finance for a review and reduction, but also the Chamber Chairman Pang Diancai has sent a letter to the Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce, seeking assistance. He requests that the matter be brought up for discussion at the general membership meeting. His reasons are: ㊀ Income tax has already been levied, and the first category is indeed similar in nature to business tax, amounting to adding structures on top of existing buildings, infringing upon the original capital. ㊁ While it is the inherent duty of merchants to pay taxes, the government should also consider the source of tax revenue when collecting taxes to determine a comprehensive policy on commercial economics.</p>
<p>Arrest of Culprits in Weitian Gate Case</p>
<p>The Fuli Reclamation Company in Shazhou City, Seventh District, recently split into two factions, old and new, due to a dispute over reclaimed land. Armed clashes have already occurred, resulting in over a dozen workers of the Xinji firm being injured, and two missing persons whose fate remains uncertain. It is widely believed that they have met a tragic end. Yesterday, it was learned that the Shazhou garrison, considering such armed clashes related to local security, went to the Yuan family's warehouse of the old Fuli Company in Yuanjiadang to disperse the rioters, and arrested five ringleaders including Li Riyu, seizing a large number of weapons, including eighteen long knives with decorated handles, over ten crescent moon spears, and over ninety pointed fork spears. They were all taken back to the unit headquarters. Currently, the seized weapons are on display at the drill ground, and the five arrested individuals have been handed over to the city court for investigation. The countryside is now temporarily in a state of quiet under the supervision of the garrison.</p>

<p>Recent News on the Gu Suming Case</p>
<p>Gu Suming, Chairman of the Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, was previously entrusted to travel to Beijing when representatives from silver firms across the country gathered in Shanghai to discuss remedies for the fineness of silver issue. Gu then entrusted Yin Zaiwei (the owner of the local Dahua Evening News) to help. Afterwards, the industry raised 38,000 yuan to pay Yin as a reward. Subsequently, Yin was arrested on suspicion of a certain crime and confessed that the money was given to him by Gu. Therefore, Gu was summoned to Beijing for questioning. Gu has now stated the amount of money collected by the firms in various places. As a result, the Capital Garrison Headquarters has commissioned the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters and local courts to summon relevant businesses to verify the facts. The silver firms in Shanghai, Hangzhou, Zhenjiang, Ningbo, Rugao, and other places have confessed that the amounts they contributed match. However, the silver firms in Wuxing and Nanjing, fearing involvement, have refused to acknowledge their contributions. Recent news indicates that in addition to the Chambers of Commerce from various places sending telegrams requesting Gu's release, his family is also requesting that he be granted bail.</p>

<h3>Bone Specialist Dr. Niu Huisheng Passed Away Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Died of Kidney Inflammation, Funeral on the Eighth, Bequest to Help Hangzhou Guangji Hospital</p>
<p>Bone specialist Dr. Niu Huisheng passed away yesterday morning (the 4th) at 3:00 AM at his residence due to chronic kidney inflammation, which was unsuccessfully treated despite repeated medical interventions. His body will be moved to the International Funeral Home and the funeral will be held on the eighth. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Orthopedic Master</p>
<p>Mr. Niu was 46 years old. He graduated from Harvard University in the United States early in his life, earning a doctorate in medicine, and was a world-renowned orthopedic master. After returning to China, he served as a professor of orthopedics at Peking Union Medical College for one year. Afterwards, he returned to Shanghai and established the Shanghai Orthopedic Hospital, served as the director of the Red Cross General Hospital, and was a professor at the Shanghai Harvard Medical School and the St. John's University Medical School. He also founded various medical-related social enterprises. During the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, he served as the Surgeon General, traveling throughout the country and contacting church hospitals to provide care for the wounded. Only after the Revolutionary Army captured Beiping did he return to Shanghai to continue running the Orthopedic Hospital. He saved many lives. His contributions to the Party and the country were especially significant. In recent years, in view of the scattered and loose nature of existing medical organizations in China's scientific community, he devoted all his energy to expanding the organization of the Chinese Medical Association and promoting medical research. The academic atmosphere was greatly enhanced. He served as the president of the Chinese Medical Association twice, both before and after its reorganization. He was widely respected both domestically and abroad as a leading figure in the medical field.</p>
<p>Passed Away Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Mr. Niu worked hard for medical affairs in recent years. Unfortunately, he overexerted himself and suddenly suffered from incurable chronic kidney inflammation. It lasted almost three years, and was treated by hundreds of Chinese and foreign doctors, but although it sometimes improved slightly, it was ultimately difficult to cure. Suddenly, in the past three weeks, his condition worsened and he passed away at 3:00 AM yesterday (the 4th). After the passing of Dr. Yu Fengbin, another great man in our medical community has fallen, causing grief to all who heard the news.</p>
<p>Deathbed Words</p>
<p>During Mr. Niu's final moments, his family was by his side. Mr. Niu was still concerned about medical affairs and earnestly told his family that after his death, all funeral ceremonies should be simple, the coffin should not exceed 400 yuan, and he hoped that friends and relatives would give money instead of flowers. All wreaths and eulogies were declined. All funeral money received should be donated to the Hangzhou Guangji Hospital to enrich the orthopedic equipment.</p>
<p>Funeral on the Eighth</p>
<p>Mr. Niu's remains were moved to the Jiaozhou Road International Funeral Home at 4:30 AM yesterday. Mr. Niu's friends and relatives have organized a funeral committee here. All arrangements are in accordance with Mr. Niu's will, striving for simplicity and avoiding extravagance. The funeral is scheduled for noon on the eighth, with the burial at the International Cemetery on Hongqiao Road at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Friends and Relatives Pay Respects</p>
<p>After Mr. Niu's remains were moved to the International Funeral Home yesterday morning, various circles in Shanghai, upon hearing the news, went to the International Funeral Home to pay their respects, including Song Ziwen, Liu Ruiheng, Yan Fuqing, Jin Baoshan, Zhu Hengbi, Xu Shihao, Chen Shutong, and hundreds of Mr. Zhu's friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Family Situation</p>
<p>Mr. Niu devoted his life to medical affairs. Although his income was relatively high, he had no savings because he founded various medical enterprises, all of which required money. He is survived by one son, Peter, who is only nine years old and is still studying at the Sino-Western Elementary School. His wife, Niu Xuheng, is also a talented woman who is very enthusiastic about social enterprises. She graduated from Nanjing Jinling Women's University and studied in the United States. In recent years, she has been particularly dedicated to various social enterprises, and women's and children's enterprises.</p>

He plans to stay in China for two months. He stated that China has made considerable progress in both economics and politics in just two years since his last visit. He is coming to Shanghai this time to investigate China's economic and political revival and will visit several provinces and meet with several government leaders. He will meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the end of this week. He has met with him several times before and believes that he is very concerned about the affairs of the Pacific Academic Conference. His visit to China has three major objectives: first, to discuss the location of the Pacific Conference to be held in China in one year. This conference is an international organization of academic conferences, and representatives from the eleven member countries of the Academic Conference will attend; second, to consult with Dr. Hu Shih, Chairman of the China Branch of the Academic Conference, on the research being conducted by the China Branch in conjunction with major universities in China on economic and political issues. This is part of the Academic Conference's program; third, to combine similar research conducted elsewhere with this conference. Mr. Carter also mentioned that the results of the previous conference proved that China's research on economics and politics made a significant contribution to the entire conference and proved that China has made great developments in all aspects of its endeavors recently. As for the location of the next conference, it will be decided by the Pacific Conference next year. It will probably be in the Philippines, Vietnam, or the Dutch East Indies, and will definitely not be in China, because it was already held in Shanghai in 1931. As for Trangxiang Mountain, it has been the location for the conference twice, and its components are less. The conference is held every two years, and about two hundred representatives from the eleven member countries attend. As for whether Manchuria and Mongolia will participate in the conference, there has been no proposal to date. Even if someone proposes it, China will definitely oppose it, and the admission of new members must be approved by all members. Therefore, raising this issue would only increase unnecessary disputes.</p>
<h3>Conflict Between Workers of Two Silk Weaving Factories and Detectives Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Two Dead, Many Injured</p>
<p>The labor unrest in the silk weaving industry in this city, after the municipal Party and government agencies issued an order to the silk factories to resume work, seemed to be coming to an end. Unexpectedly, a conflict broke out again between the foreman and workers in the Hongchang Silk Weaving Factory on Connaught Road in the west of Shanghai due to the contract system. The contract foremen of the factory, recognizing that they would suffer considerable losses after this processing, united with the foremen of other factories using the contract system to form a machine-guarding group to maintain their own interests, but in reality, it seemed to be hindering the livelihood of the workers. Therefore, after receiving the news, the workers were also invisibly plotting to confront them. At about 0:10 AM yesterday morning, a Hongchang contract foreman suddenly had a quarrel with a worker over a trivial matter, followed by physical violence. At that time, eight workers were beaten by the foremen. The workers in the factory immediately reported to the labor union and notified the neighboring Datong Silk Weaving Factory. At this time, all the workers of the Datong Factory had not yet left work. Upon hearing the news, they immediately gathered more than a thousand people and rushed to the Caojiadu Police Sub-bureau to petition for assistance. The sub-bureau and the municipal Party and government agencies sent personnel to persuade them, and they dispersed. More than five hundred workers, after leaving the police sub-bureau, turned to Connaught Road and went straight to the Hongchang Silk Weaving Factory, gathering at the entrance and refusing to leave, demanding that the factory immediately abolish the contract system. The person in charge of the factory, fearing an accident, urgently telegraphed the Gordon Road police station for protection. After receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of Chinese, Western, and Indian detectives and volunteers, riding in eleven police vehicles, to suppress the situation. The two sides confronted each other near the triangular field there, but the workers were numerous and vocal, causing a commotion. This led to the intervention of detectives, but the workers still appeared to be surging, forming a confrontation. A conflict eventually broke out, resulting in dozens of workers being injured on the spot and the order was disrupted. At this time, the city Party headquarters, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Garrison Headquarters, the Police Brigade, etc. all rushed to the scene after hearing the news, trying to mediate and ordering the workers to disperse. The contract foremen who caused the trouble were promised to be investigated after investigation. The workers were satisfied and gradually dispersed, but it was already five o'clock. As for the injured workers, they were sent to various hospitals such as Zhongshan, Red Cross, Labor, and Binlong by the police bureau and police station in batches by ambulance. Among them, Ji Deyuan died upon arrival at Zhongshan Hospital due to a severe waist injury. Another worker from the Meiya Factory, Du Huichang from Shaoxing, 27 years old, also died two hours after being sent to the Red Cross Hospital due to serious injuries. Both were sent to the mortuary for examination. The other injured workers sent to Binlong Hospital included Xu Lanting (50 years old) from the Qungong Silk Weaving Factory, injured in the waist and head, in a very serious condition, and was admitted to the hospital. Guo Xiaolin (30), Yan Asheng (32) were both injured in the head, Shan Hualin (31) was injured in the waist, Wang Ziqing (31) was injured in the head, Wang Laomu (35) from the Wanbin Factory was injured in the face, Shi Shengrong (29), Zhou Fuhua (40) were both injured in the head, Lu Fuquan (38) was injured in the leg, Yan Xiaobin (26) was injured in the head, Yang Aquan (31) was injured in the right eye, Chen Ruyang (21) from the Tianqin Factory was injured in the head, Chen Ayuan (22) from the Datong Factory was injured in the hands and legs, and Jin Adai (46) from the Damei Factory was injured in the head. It is said that the injuries were not very serious, so they were bandaged and discharged. The labor unions of the silk weaving industry in the third district also immediately sent personnel to investigate the names and numbers of the injured workers after the incident and reported the details to the municipal Party headquarters, the municipal government, and the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting assistance and fair handling, and requesting the municipal authorities to make serious representations to the Municipal Council's police department.</p>

<h3>National Sugar Production and Sales Association Telegrahs Request to Participate in World Sugar Conference</h3>
<p>Telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Industry Yesterday, to Facilitate Dealing with Production and Sales Distribution</p>
<p>The China National Sugar Production and Sales Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the matter of the World Sugar Conference distributing the production and sales volume of sugar industries in various countries.</p>
<p>The esteemed Minister of Finance Kong and Minister of Industry Wu,</p>
<p>I have heard that the London World Sugar Conference has decided to organize a permanent World Sugar Management Committee, whose task is to balance and distribute production and sales, as well as other matters relating to sugar. As our country is the second largest sugar market in the world, it is of great importance. I am writing to request that you telegrah the London World Sugar Conference to invite our country to join the association. If our country also obtains a seat on the committee, it will not only be possible to learn more about its affairs, but also, if the association supports the import of sugar into our country, or if there are developments in the national sugar industry, it will be easier to cope with.</p>
<p>I also send this letter to Minister Zha of the Ministry of Finance and Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry,</p>
<p>Humbly request your approval for implementation.</p>

<h3>Local Association Held Spring General Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>President Du Yuesheng Delivered Opening Remarks, Huang Renzhi Reported on the Situation in Jiangxi Province</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association held its spring general meeting of members at the Zhonghui Building clubhouse at 6:00 PM yesterday. More than 50 people attended, including Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Pang Jingzhou, and Pan Yangyao. After President Du Yuesheng delivered the opening remarks and reported on association affairs, Huang Renzhi reported on the local situation in Jiangxi Province. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>President's Address</p>
<p>President Du Yuesheng said in his opening remarks: "This association's spring general meeting was originally scheduled to be held at the end of March. However, it coincided with the spring holiday, and most of our members were away from Shanghai. Therefore, we postponed the meeting until [blank] day to make it up. Our association now has a total of 241 members. When it was first established, there were only over 80 people. Now, the number has increased more than threefold. With talent gathered together, the association's strength will naturally be more substantial. The future progress of the association's affairs will depend entirely on the joint efforts of all members. The nature of our association originally falls within the local scope, but there are many things in society that may seem easy at first glance, or even unrelated to our association. However, upon closer examination, a small issue in one area can often affect other places, or even a small dispute in one part can affect the overall situation. Shanghai is the center of Chinese and foreign communication and the economic center of the country. Its position is very important. Therefore, the work of our association cannot be divided by region or by nature. We all believe that it is necessary to carefully consider and handle all matters, such as labor unrest, financial issues, and international issues. We must not be too hasty or too conservative, but strive to achieve the right balance. I hope that all members of this association will share responsibility and work together. Today's meeting is a gathering for camaraderie. I offer some opinions, and I ask everyone to discuss them together."</p>
<p>Reporting Items</p>

Based on this, this association submitted a petition to designate Gaoqiao as an experimental zone to take over the Improvement Association.

<h3>Leprosy Patients in Guangdong Province Are Not Being Harmed</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, reports from relevant sources indicate that the horrifying news of the massacre of leprosy patients in Guangdong Province is likely due to the segregation of patients based on the severity of their condition as determined by the province's examination. When this news first emerged a month ago, the Central Government immediately telegraphed the Guangdong provincial authorities, instructing them to promptly cease any mistreatment of leprosy patients. Mayor Zeng Yangfu of Guangzhou replied by telegram, stating that leprosy patients had been searched for the sake of public health because the number of patients had increased and they were freely cohabitating with those who had not contracted the disease. Therefore, the police conducted the search purely to protect the general public and not to harm the patients. After arriving in Guangzhou, Chairman Wu Tiecheng of Guangdong Province immediately sought to provide patients with appropriate treatment in a suitable environment. The existing leprosy hospitals were already full and could not accept more patients. Therefore, another leprosy hospital was built on a barren island called Yuanjiangsha near Panyu, covering an area of 800 mu with an allocation of 140,000 yuan. The preliminary preparations have been underway for three months, and it is expected that the new hospital will be able to admit leprosy patients in three months.</p>
<h3>Reduction of Interest Rates by Foreign Banks Has Little Impact on Chinese Banks</h3>
<p>Lowering Interest Rates Is a Sign of Market Improvement; Chinese and Foreign Banks Have Different Operating Goals</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, after foreign banks in this city, such as HSBC and Mercantile Bank, reduced the interest rate on current deposits to 1% per week this month, concerns have arisen in all sectors regarding the impact of this move on Chinese banks. A reporter inquired with banking circles about the trend of this issue. It is understood that the purpose of foreign banks in lowering interest rates this time is to enable importers and exporters to use low-interest overdrafts to order goods and develop their respective businesses. Before China implemented the legal tender policy, Shanghai was affected by the global recession, and most industries and businesses were in a difficult situation. To protect themselves, financial institutions restricted lending with high interest rates. However, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, domestic and foreign markets have eased, and the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have successfully stabilized foreign exchange, greatly increasing international credit. As a result, the market has improved, and banks are providing low-interest loans to increase international trade and invest in various construction projects. The reduction of interest rates by foreign banks does not have a significant impact on Chinese banks because Chinese and foreign banks have different operating goals. For example, since the three banks stabilized foreign exchange, the Chinese people are happy to purchase foreign exchange from the three banks. Furthermore, the interest rates on current deposits in Chinese banks are not very high, with the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications typically offering 2% per week, and other large and small commercial banks generally offering between 3% and 4%. In conclusion, the reduction of interest rates by foreign banks is a good sign of market improvement.</p>

<h3>Japanese Cotton Mills in China Increase Workers' Wages</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai branch of the Domei News Agency on the 4th, the Japanese Cotton Spinning Association in China held an emergency meeting at the Japanese Club on Peng Road in this city at 1:00 PM yesterday. In view of the increase in workers' wages at cotton mills in Japan, the Gonda Cotton Mill decided to increase the wages of workers in its Chinese factories. The meeting yesterday discussed whether other factories should also increase wages. As a result, it was decided that from May 1st, the wages of all Chinese male and female workers in Japanese cotton mills would be increased by 10% of their current wages. Fearing that this move would affect Chinese and British factories, the Japanese Cotton Spinning Association will notify the Chinese Cotton Mill Association and the British Cotton Spinning Company. Currently, the number of workers in Japanese cotton mills in China is 52,000 in Shanghai, 33,000 in Qingdao, 10,000 in Tianjin, and 1,500 in Hankou. As a result of the wage increase by Japanese cotton mills this time, the total income of all workers will increase by 1.7 million yuan per year. If Chinese and British factories also increase wages by 10% in accordance with the Japanese cotton mills, the total income of all workers in the Chinese, Japanese, and British cotton mills will increase by 5 million yuan per year.</p>

<h3>Citizens of Wusong District Oppose the Levy of Household Donations</h3>
<p>Appeal to the Finance Bureau to Suspend the Levy</p>
<p>The Shanghai Finance Bureau recently sent personnel to various districts to investigate and levy household donations on a household-by-household basis, with a deadline of one week for payment. Residents of Wusong District, upon hearing the news, rose up in opposition and flocked to the Municipal Affairs Committee Office and the Eighth District Party Headquarters to appeal and request that the authorities temporarily suspend the levy. They also organized a citizens' association and held a preparatory meeting at the Eighth District Party Headquarters at 1:00 PM yesterday, electing Wu Renqi as the temporary chairman. The main reasons for the opposition were that Wusong District was affected by the January 28th Incident, and the entire town was reduced to scorched earth and has not yet recovered its original state. Furthermore, most residents are unable to repay the housing loans issued by the municipal government in previous years on time. Therefore, they are unable to bear the act of levying household donations. It was resolved to appeal to the Finance Bureau to temporarily suspend the levy of household donations in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

<h3>Anonymous Letter in the Mo Jin-song Case</h3>
<p>Inviting Judge to a Nightclub Visit; Court Transfers Defendant for Investigation</p>
<p>Mo Jin-song, a Shaoxing native and owner of the Momo-ji Oil Drum Company on Park Road, residing at 23 Chengxing Lane on Park Road, was accused of seducing and having illicit relations with a fifteen-year-old dancer named Wu Meixiu from the Peach Blossom River Dance Hall in February of this year. Wu's mother, Xu, reported this to the Xinzha Police Station, which prosecuted Mo for rape under Article 221 of the Criminal Code. Mo was repeatedly summoned but failed to appear, leading to an arrest warrant. Mo then surrendered to the First Special Court with his lawyer and was ordered to be detained. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Ri-sheng presided over the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. Both the plaintiff and defendant had lawyers present in court. The judge, considering the case's impact on public morals, ordered the hearing to be closed to the public. After the hearing, Judge Huang Jin-song was denied bail and ordered to remain in detention. The defense concluded, and a sentencing date was set for 9:00 AM on the 6th. However, in the interim, Judge Huang Ri-sheng received an anonymous letter, purportedly from a relative of Mo, urging the judge to show leniency towards Mo Jin-song, grant him bail, and offered a bribe to be paid by a representative who would be wearing a grey Western suit, wearing glasses and had a tin of White Rose cigarettes on the table at the Great East dance hall. Judge Huang, furious upon receiving the letter, transferred it to the prosecutor's office. Consequently, after the case was concluded, Mo Jin-song was transferred for investigation. Prosecutor Zhang Zongru presided over the Ninth Criminal Court and questioned Mo about his repeated failures to appear in court. Mo replied that he was running a central egg factory in Xinghua, and was busy with the business. The court ordered Mo to write the characters "Park Road Mo Jin-song, grateful for labor and concerned, at the Great East Dance Hall, White Rose cigarettes, glasses" for handwriting verification. The defendant's lawyer stated that this was a malicious trick by someone with a grudge against Mo and should be thoroughly investigated. Prosecutor Zhang ordered Mo Jin-song to be detained pending verification.</p>

<h3>Paramount to Hold Early Summer Ball</h3>
<p>Ticket Proceeds to Benefit New Building at Hongqiao Sanatorium</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Hongqiao Sanatorium, established in the summer of 1934, was sponsored by former Mayor Wu Tiecheng. Not only is the building modern and the environment beautiful, but the control of air quality and the capture of light is second to none in the country. When the hospital's president, Dr. Ding Huikang, investigated anti-tuberculosis facilities in various countries two years ago, he asked Dr. Yan Fuqing, president of the National Shanghai Medical College, to serve as acting director. Since Ding's return to China last spring, the improvements in treatment, the implementation of various compression surgeries for lung diseases, the automatic electrical testing of heart diseases, and the fusion of natural therapy, physical therapy, and surgical therapy have been trusted by more patients. The number of people going for treatment and examination is increasing. However, the hospital only has first and second class facilities.

<h3>Jardine Brewery Hosted Press Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Buddhist Association Notice: Protection of Ancient Temples, Pagodas, and Buddha Statues</h3>
<p>Attached Copy of the Military Affairs Commission's Reply Telegram: Orders for All Troops to Protect</p>
<p>The Chinese Buddhist Association yesterday instructed all county and city branches nationwide to forward the following to all temples nationwide:</p>
<p>"Regarding the approval of a letter from the Bodhi Society, which states: 'This society has previously seen reports that troops in border areas have arbitrarily destroyed Buddha statues in certain Lama temples. If such behavior is not banned, there is a risk that all ancient temples' inherited Buddha statues, pagodas, scriptures, ritual implements, wall paintings, inscriptions, carvings, and other objects will be destroyed. This greatly hinders the nation's aim of promoting Buddhist studies and preserving ancient cultural art. To prevent such incidents, we have, in the name of our society, sent a telegram to the Military Affairs Commission requesting that they investigate and ban this behavior and make every effort to protect these items.'</p>
<p>We have now received a reply telegram ordering the Ministry of Military Administration to issue a notice to protect these items.

<h3>Dispute Arising from Taking Medicine: Husband and Wife Involved in Litigation</h3>
<p>Attached Copy of the Military Affairs Commission's Reply Telegram: Orders for All Troops to Protect</p>
<p>Zhao Guoguang, a native of Taizhou and the owner of the Gongdelin Vegetable Shop at No. 40, Lane 41, Pike Road, married Ge Juqing two months ago. Recently, Zhao learned that his wife was suffering from irregular menstruation, so he bought several doses of a regulating medicine and ordered Ge to take it. On the 14th of last month, Zhao suspected that Ge had not taken the medicine, which led to a dispute, followed by physical violence, causing Ge to be injured. She reported this to the Xinzha Police Station and filed a lawsuit against Zhao in the First Special Court for assault. The court had previously summoned them and advised them to settle out of court. Yesterday morning, Judge Ye Shengchao continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court.</p>
<p>According to the defendant, Zhao Guoguang, after the postponement, Wen Lanting was appointed as mediator, but the plaintiff's conditions were too harsh, so no agreement was reached. Zhao denied beating Ge, claiming that her injuries may have been caused by a fall. The court then advised Ge to drop the lawsuit and return home to live with the defendant. Ge stated that the defendant had instructed her to find a way to die with a knife and rope, so she was unwilling to live with him again, insisting on continuing the lawsuit and filing a civil suit, demanding compensation of 50 yuan for medical expenses. After arguments between the police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, and the defendant's lawyer, Zhu Chengxun, Judge Ye announced that the verdict would be announced this Saturday.</p>
<h3>Ironworker on Zhabei Xinmin Road Rapes Young Girl</h3>
<p>Lower Body Injured, Case Referred to Court</p>
<p>Around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Jiang Feng's eight-year-old daughter, Shun Di, of No. 887, Intersection of Wuzhen Road, Xinmin Road, Zhabei, was playing with the daughter of Zhang Xue, who works at a nearby iron factory. Unexpectedly, Chen Genfa, a worker at the iron factory, lured Shun Di upstairs, pushed her onto the floor, and raped her. Shun Di screamed in pain. Her mother rushed over and found that her lower body was injured and bleeding. She reported this to the responsible Xinzha Police Branch, who took the ironworker, Chen Genfa, into custody. After questioning him, the police officers, considering the case involved the rape of a young girl, transferred him to the Shanghai Local Court yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>Divorce Case of Ding Shanming and Wife Difficult to Reconcile</h3>
<p>Ding Shanming, a local resident, 29 years old, and a graduate of Fudan University, relying on the blessings of his ancestors, opened the Longda Cigarette and Paper Shop on Hongqiao Road. His residence is at No. 4, Deyu Lane, Houjie, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Xiejiao. In 1927, he married Ding Gu, the daughter of Gu Rungui, a wealthy merchant on Hongqiao Road (currently 30 years old). However, Ding Shanming's appearance is unusually ugly, while Ms. Gu comes from a wealthy family, and their lifestyles are completely different. Therefore, Ms. Gu had returned to her parents' home for an extended period. Unexpectedly, she had an affair with Cao Zhongfu, and in January of this year, she stayed at Room 374, Dongfang Hotel, Yu Qiaqing Road, for a month. This was discovered by Ding, who reported it to the police, who took her to the First Special Court. She was sentenced to three months' imprisonment, commutable to a fine.</p>
<p>Therefore, Ding Shanming hired lawyer Gong Wenhuan to file for divorce from Ding Gu in the Local Court. Yesterday, Judge Yu Shiqi continued the hearing. After Ding Shanming presented his account, Ding Gu stated, "I live at Huiyuan Rice Shop, Chengjiaqiao, Hongqiao, West Shanghai. Ding Shanming is my husband. We married on January 8, 1927, and have not had any children. He took concubine Yang Xingmei in February 1929, and she has already given birth to a son. He abandoned me a long time ago. Since he loves another, why can't I love another? That's why I had an affair with Cao Zhongfu, which is true. So, if he wants a divorce, I agree. However, the blame for the extremes of our marriage lies with the plaintiff, who first took a concubine. Therefore, I am submitting a photo of Yang Xingmei and a mourning couplet Ding sent after my father's death, which includes the words 'leading son,' sufficient to prove that he took a concubine and had a son. Therefore, I demand the return of the entire set of rosewood dowry and other jewelry."</p>
<p>Ding replied that he did not recognize the person in the photo and had not taken a concubine. As for the words "leading son," it refers to an adopted son. As for the jewelry, it has all been used up by Ms. Gu through opium addiction over the years. This lawsuit, of course, arose because of Ms. Gu's adultery, so I demand compensation for all my losses.</p>
<p>Thus, there is no problem with the divorce, but both parties want money. The judge tried to mediate, asking both parties to compromise, as unresolved cases can drag on for one or two years through three trials, causing immeasurable losses. After two hours of fruitless negotiation, as both parties insisted on money and could not agree, the case was postponed for another hearing.</p>
<h3>The Tribulations of Lovers Becoming a Couple</h3>
<p>Zhang Rufeng's Deep Affection; Zhang Mao's Disapproval</p>
<p>Zhang Mao, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 134, Caishi Road, is a widow with a daughter named Rufeng, currently 18 years old, who is quite beautiful. Living with her is Xie Baoshan from Yangzhou, who has a fellow townsman named Miao Renhai, 27 years old, residing at No. 114, Jiuxiaochang, who makes leather balls for a living and is still unmarried. He often visited Xie's place for casual chats and fell in love with Rufeng. He bribed Xie's wife, Chen, to act as a matchmaker, and they fell in love. On April 12 of last year, he eloped with Rufeng. On February 4 of this year, Rufeng was encountered on the road by Xu Mingchun, a tenant of her mother's, who stirred up a hornet's nest. Xu Mingchun, who had no relationship to the matter, took Rufeng to the police station, who summoned Zhang Mao and released her daughter.</p>
<p>However, Rufeng's feelings ran deep, and she vowed not to return home. She had no choice but to temporarily reside at her aunt Li Zhang's home. On the 12th of the same month, Zhang Rufeng, with her aunt's consent, volunteered to marry Miao Renhai. She went to Miao's house with Xie Cheng to present a marriage certificate and take the bride price of 46 yuan, and they planned to choose a date for the wedding, believing that the lovers would finally become a couple.</p>
<p>But Zhang Mao, the mother, complained to heaven, disapproving of her daughter's choice. She reported this to the police, who took everyone to the local court prosecutor and filed a public lawsuit. Yesterday, Judge Bai opened the court.</p>
<p>Miao Renhai stated, "At that time, Rufeng said that her father was dead, and her mother was having an affair. She was working outside and suffering terribly. She volunteered to follow me, and so on."</p>
<p>Zhang Mao stated, "My daughter was seduced and abducted by Xie Cheng, who acted as a go-between, and they dared to privately draw up a marriage certificate without my consent. Therefore, I request a severe sentence and hire lawyer Xu to ask for 200 yuan in consolation money, etc."</p>
<p>Xie Cheng stated, "Li Zhang, Rufeng's aunt, entrusted me to be the matchmaker, and I did not pull the strings," etc.</p>
<p>Li Zhang stated, "I did not entrust Xie Chen to be the matchmaker. Rufeng was at my house and was called out by a woman and never returned until this year."</p>
<p>The court ordered the arguments to be concluded, and the sentence will be announced on the afternoon of the 6th.</p>
<h3>Widow Attempts Suicide by Drowning, Rescued</h3>
<p>Jin Deming from Chaozhou, formerly worked in a pawnshop and lived at No. 3, Danshui Road, Public Concession. Last year, due to unemployment and inability to make a living, he committed suicide by swallowing opium. He left behind a wife, Gu, only 24 years old, and three young children. Gu was also pregnant. The family was in an extremely difficult situation. However, Gu was determined to remain chaste. Except for the two eldest sons, who were sent to the free elementary school run by the Chaozhou County Association, she moved to No. 27, Tongli, with her youngest child to save on rent. At the end of last year, she gave birth to another son.</p>
<p>Gu was determined to raise her children to adulthood to have someone to rely on in the future. Her will was firm, and her neighbors praised her. However, her 12-year-old eldest son, Weiqing, suddenly died of illness on the 3rd of this month. Gu was heartbroken and had the idea of committing suicide. The day before yesterday, at home, she tried to commit suicide by hitting her head against the wall. Fortunately, she was discovered by her housemates, but she was already bleeding from her head. Around 6:00 PM, she entrusted her infant to the second landlord and said she was going out for a bit, walked to the Bund Pier on Wuma Road, and jumped into the river to commit suicide. She was again discovered and rescued by Chinese police officers on the pier. Because she had swallowed a lot of water, she was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>After receiving the report, the Customs Water Patrol Police Station dispatched detective Li Wenqi to the hospital to inquire about the reason for the suicide and summoned the wife of the former second landlord from No. 3, who was on good terms with Gu, to the hospital to comfort and accompany her home. A missionary at the hospital, feeling that Gu was extremely pitiful, planned to find ways to help her.</p>

<h3>Ancient Mirror Unearthed in Wusong</h3>
<p>The China Animal Protection Association is constructing a large-scale release garden in Yangxing Town, Wusong, which began construction at the beginning of last month. The construction of the surrounding wall is nearing completion, and the construction of the ponds in the garden has also begun. On the morning of the 1st of this month, workers excavating the pool suddenly unearthed an ancient bronze round mirror at a depth of about five or six feet below the ground. After reporting this to the on-site supervisor sent by the association, the supervisor sent it to Ye Gongchuo, the chairman of the association, for identification of the age. It is now displayed at the association on Yunnan Road. The mirror is about one and a half feet in length and width, and weighs about ten pounds. The back of the mirror is engraved with the four characters "Hundred Years of Reunion" and figures, etc. The ancient colors are mottled and faintly discernible. According to Ye Gongchuo, the mirror is roughly from the Ming Dynasty or the early Qing Dynasty, and it should not exceed the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, in terms of age, it cannot be considered very old. However, the size and thickness of the object are rare among copper mirrors unearthed in the Ming and Qing Dynasties.</p>

<p>TALK</p>
<h3>Invite the Children to be Friendly</h3>
<p>—Mexico</p>
<p>To what extent China and Japan are currently "friendly" is simply confusing. Japanese ruffians have repeatedly assaulted customs officers, and the "Pan-Pacific Exposition" held in Nagoya lists the Republic of China alongside the "Eastern Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council" and the "Manchukuo Pavilion." Other trivial matters, such as "chatting about the emperor" leading to imprisonment and being punished for throwing pear peels, are too numerous to mention. "If others harm us, we cannot but resist." It seems that "promoting friendly relations" is indeed not easy.</p>
<p>Therefore, some believe that "the friendship between China and Japan should begin with the friendship of the children of the two countries." Children are the future masters of the country. Starting with their childhood, it is natural to "achieve twice the result with half the effort," so to speak "hugging a cat is like hugging a suckling kitten." Moreover, children are innocent and naive. When they sing and dance together, how can they distinguish between "aggression" and "friendship"? This is truly a good "fundamental solution." Now, the authorities of Nagasaki Prefecture and the city authorities have agreed on specific methods. That is, "Each elementary school in Nagasaki City will select ten male and female students as student representatives, who will be led by five teachers on the Nagasaki Maru on May 23 to visit elementary schools in Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou, and return to Japan in early June. After the group returns to Japan, the Nagasaki Prefecture authorities will hold an exhibition at Katsuyama Elementary School in Nagasaki in mid-June or late June, displaying the paintings, calligraphy, compositions, handicrafts, and other achievements of elementary school students from China and Japan for the general public to visit. Nagasaki City will hold a grand meeting of all elementary school students from time to time, inviting students from Chinese schools in Nagasaki to attend. Students visiting China will report on the results of their visits to Chinese schools, and perform singing, music, and dancing to add to the fun."</p>
<p>However, Chinese children are too shy. When they see foreign children playing soccer and fighting in the park, they hide behind people and peek. When they ride tricycles in the lanes, they cry and go home, saying that they were slapped with a "ham" by the foreign children next door. These are children who are accustomed to seeing foreign children in Shanghai. As for the children in Suzhou and Hangzhou, mothers can use the lie that "the Japanese are coming" to trick them into going to sleep obediently. Fortunately, the ten male and female students "selected" by the elementary schools in Nagasaki City this time came with a "mission of friendship," so they are not likely to be clumsy and make Chinese children shy away. Moreover, they are led by five teachers, so it seems that they must do some "friendly" deeds to report back home. This is reassuring for Chinese elementary school students.</p>
<p>However, after the "friendship," they will return to Japan to hold an exhibition, displaying the achievements of students from both countries, and invite overseas Chinese students to attend. Chinese elementary school students used to read "When chaos began, heaven and earth were first established." Now they are reading nothing more than "Little cat meows, little dog jumps." Japanese elementary school students, it is said, already know that "the Three Eastern Provinces are vast in area and rich in products," as well as "the effectiveness of tanks." Comparing the two, it may be that the exhibition will give Chinese children "great stimulation," so they feel that "If others harm us, we cannot but resist." Then "the plan under the support of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs since Showa 9" will be completely abandoned!</p>
<p>Inviting the children to be friendly is not working either, so what other way is there?......</p>
<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Li Xuan</p>
<p>The children are singing at the foot of the mountain:</p>
<p>"It's raining, it's raining, shepherd,</p>
<p>Quickly drive your white sheep into the shed,</p>
<p>Run quickly, the raindrops are loud, the thunder is loud,</p>
<p>Scaring the sheep with nowhere to hide..."</p>
<p>It was already dark, and the torrential rain was sweeping the cliffs like arrows, and the rainwater flowed down through the grass. It poured excitedly on the mountain road, and small splashes of water splashed up in the low-lying areas. Black clouds filled the sky, the wind whistled through the branches, and the old shepherd was still climbing up the mountainside step by step, his raincoat dripping with water, his mouth constantly, loudly, calling out to the lost lambs.</p>
<p>A gust of wind and rain blew in his face, so he hunched down and used his hand to tilt his green straw hat to block the raindrops hitting his face, and then tentatively slipped past a very steep stone slope. Just as he touched a muddy path, a dazzling lightning bolt fell from the bottomless, dark sky, illuminating a dilapidated temple built in the mountain depression. He shouted loudly, stepped on the wet and cold mud road and walked past.</p>
<p>He heard someone groaning softly inside, near the half-closed temple door. He pushed the door open, and there was a dark shadow lying in the corner. The old shepherd trembled his dry fingers and lit a match. The dark shadow looked very weak, shivering and trembling, using a dusty gray garment to wrap something, and then began to cry.</p>
<p>The old man was so startled that he didn't know what to do. After calming down, he picked up the scorched wormwood sticks on the ground, made the fire burn, and walked upwind to the person:</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Alone in the dark..."</p>
<p>The person trembled even more, covering his face with a wide sleeve, his throat seemed to be frozen, and he sobbed and wept, coughing constantly. A thin layer of dry grass was spread on the ground, the grass was stained with something wet, and a layer of dust was scattered on the surface. In the gaps in the soil, watery, red-black blood was revealed. The old man suddenly squatted down as if he had been stabbed, and squeezed the trembling arm with one hand, shaking it continuously twice, saying:</p>
<p>"You: Did you kill someone?"</p>
<p>The person cried out in horror, then threw away the thing in his arms, fell back on the withered grass, coughed dryly and vomited on the ground. Rain poured into the house from the collapsed roof, the wind blew the door open, and the light of the fire was extinguished, the room suddenly turned into a terrifying darkness. The old man groped for a match again and relit it. He held a bunch of freshly lit dry grass tightly, pushed the broken door panel shut, and shone the light on the gray-white little thing rolling in the mud. He shuddered in fear, exclaimed, and when he stretched out his rough palm and stroked the naked, slightly reddish, newborn baby, the little body was already cold, the hair was wet and soft like a newborn lamb, the little mouth was turned down, the eyes were deeply sunken, and the umbilical cord connecting to the mother's body was still attached to the navel...</p>
<p>"Grandpa, please have mercy on me..."</p>
<p>The old man turned around, and the little woman who spoke was already kneeling on the ground. She had a pair of pleading eyes, and tears were falling. She was wearing a gray cloth gown with a large collar, a bare head, and not a trace of blood on her round little face. Tears welled up from the corners of her big eyes like springs. The old man understood everything. He looked at the trembling, pitiful woman and asked:</p>
<p>"Where is the baby's father?"</p>
<p>She lowered her head and cried softly:</p>
<p>"He is a shepherd, I looked for him the day before yesterday, but he had already left the village."</p>
<p>The old man sighed sadly, and he woke up as if from a dream: that young partner, why did he travel far away on a foggy dawn. He touched his wet eyes and shook his head:</p>
<p>"A pitiful little life!"</p>
<p>"I want to go back to the nunnery, I have no way to support him..."</p>
<p>The rain grew heavier, pouring down from the hillside like a rushing stream, jumping over the obstructing rocks. In the dark and gloomy night sky, a flash of cold electric light would occasionally appear, and distant thunder rumbled. A lost sheep, under the dense rain, walked past a puddle next to the grass, bleating, one mournful cry after another.</p>
<p>In the darkness of the earth, the gale and lightning still scattered wildly.</p>
<h3>Treasures Used During the Coronation of the British King</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The royal crowns and other ceremonial items owned by the British royal family are of such great value that they are almost impossible to estimate. These jewels and gold ornaments are usually kept in the Tower of London, and are only taken out for use during coronation ceremonies or formal openings of parliament. It is said that their total value is between 250 million and 300 million yuan. Some of these treasures were obtained in the early Middle Ages. For example, a large ruby on the royal crown, worth about 500,000 yuan, originally belonged to the King of Granada, and was later given to the Black Prince by the King of Castile in 1367. King Henry of England wore this ruby on his helmet during the Battle of Agincourt, and that helmet is now kept in Westminster Abbey.</p>
<p>Among the ceremonial items are Elizabeth's pearl earrings, Edward's large emerald, and a diamond called the "Koh-i-Noor," which is probably the most valuable in the world. It was once set in the crown of the Indian Emperor, and was presented to Queen Victoria by the British army ninety years ago.</p>
<p>The British King has three crowns, one is the Imperial Crown, one is the State Crown used during coronation, and the other is the Indian Imperial Crown. The State Crown worn during coronation is too heavy to be worn for long. It is made of gold and inlaid with pearls, emeralds, rubies, sapphires, and diamonds. It weighs more than five pounds and is worth about 150,000 yuan. During the coronation, the Archbishop of Canterbury holds it and places it on the King's head.</p>
<p>The Indian Imperial Crown is the newest crown, made in 1912. King George V wore it for the first time at the Indian Imperial Coronation Ceremony held in Delhi that year. It is extremely exquisite and said to be worth 200,000 yuan. It is inlaid with 6,000 diamonds, emeralds, rubies, and sapphires. The most valuable of these is a large emerald and a true pigeon-blood Indian ruby, which is a rare treasure in the world.</p>
<p>There is also the coronation ring, also known as the marriage ring of England, which is put on the King's finger during the coronation ceremony. A new ring is made for each new king's coronation, and the Tower of London now holds three or four such rings. In the center is a large ruby or sapphire, surrounded by large diamonds. This ring is put on the King's finger after the golden orb is presented to the new King. The golden orb represents dominion over the world, and is inlaid with many jewels, with a large amethyst on top, and a diamond cross erected on the amethyst, with a ruby in the center of the cross. No one knows its value.</p>
<p>When the new King sits on the coronation throne in the cathedral after the coronation ceremony, the scepter of St. Edward is placed on his left and right. This scepter is also known as the rod of justice, made of gold and about four feet long. It is said that the original scepter of St. Edward had a cross, but the scepter was lost after Charles I was executed, when Cromwell swept away many royal treasures during the Civil War. The current one is a reproduction of the old style.</p>
<p>The British King has four swords, all inlaid with many jewels, which are also used during the coronation. One is the National Sword of State, worth about 100,000 yuan. It is said that the sword is the most beautiful and valuable in the world. It is made of hardened gold, and the large sapphire inlaid on it is worth 15,000 yuan. The sword is presented to the church by the new King, expressing his sincerity of allegiance. After the church accepts it, the new King buys it back for one hundred shillings. The other three swords are, one is the Sword of Mercy, which has a blunt tip, representing mercy. One is the Sword of Justice, held behind the King by a courtier. One is also the Sword of State, with a lion and a unicorn, representing the guards of the British royal arms. The four swords are all inlaid with gold and jewels.</p>
<p>When the new King performs the coronation ceremony, he holds a royal scepter in his right hand, with a bright glass that looks like a fist on top. It is called the "Star of Africa," and is the largest diamond in the world, which cannot be used for other purposes unless it is cut open. Except for the diamond on the crown and a diamond on display in the museum, this one is the most valuable and cannot be estimated.</p>
<p>In addition, there are golden spurs, presented to the new King by his subjects and placed on the altar of the cathedral, representing that he is offering himself to God as the leader of the British army.</p>
<p>At the climax of the coronation ceremony, a sacred oil is used to anoint the face of the new Emperor, signifying that he has been bestowed with the anointing from God and granted the divine right of all kings. The vessel for holding the sacred oil is a golden eagle standing on a small empty container. In fact, the sacred oil is contained in this small container. This container is relatively new, but the golden eagle is an antique from 1,400 years ago, and a golden spoon that is more than a thousand years old is still used to scoop out the oil. The handle of the golden spoon is inlaid with four pearls, and the design is very unique. People have used various metals to imitate and sell it as a coronation souvenir.</p>
<p>The items used for the Queen's coronation are not as many, but their value is also extremely great. Each time a new Queen is crowned, a new crown is made. This year's Queen's crown is not made of gold, but of platinum, which is a first in British history. The frame of the new crown is the diadem used by Queen Victoria, inlaid with countless jewels, with several large diamonds in the center.</p>
