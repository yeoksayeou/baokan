<h3>英國與法西斯國家㊂</h3>
<p>— 英議員Strabolgi　金圖南譯</p>
<p>關於歸還　德國殖民地的困雞問題，特別是在菲洲方面、我們不相信沒有一些秘密的諒解。今年夏季南菲聯合國的國防部長皮羅氏聘問於倫敦，回到南菲之後、公開實稱英國的重要人物告訴他說，英國政策將支持德國在菲洲領士慾望的要求。皮羅氏的這句話顯然變換了一個說法了。</p>
<p>倫敦有一位　最重要的人物汪西泰爵士是外交部常任官員的領袖。他的夫人和飛利潑斯夫人（英國駐德大使夫人）是姊妹行•汪氏是一向親法的，直到今年的夏季。</p>
<p>今年七八月之間　他以私人資格公然到柏林去，站在希特勒的旁邊參觀世界運動會。他和德國各位正式與非正式的外交大員如希特勒元首，里本脫洛浦，牛拉斯等並沒有討論過運動問題，而他的目的是要和這幾位重要的外交人物接近：便是我們須注意，自從皮羅氏訪問倫敦以後，對意制裁政策取銷，自從汪氏到了柑林之後，德國對於收回以前的殖民地或是割讓熱帶半熱帶殖民地性質的領土，其實傳的注重之點也發生了變化。</p>
<p>這樣，估有殖民地的這個紛擾，巳經讓渡到了這件事情完善解决的設想境地了。</p>
<p>英國保守黨中　尚有一部份有力的人物，不顧德國或他國的權力政體是怎樣，激烈反對把英國的領土滿足德國或他國的需要。你們不願意拋棄殖民地保護地委任統治地領域的寸地尺地。這般人是奮派的帝國主義者，是給已故的約瑟張伯倫所覺醒過來的。</p>
<p>這個伯明漢　政策的贊助者，如今有奧斯丁張伯倫（即財和張伯倫的異母兄弟）和前任閣員阿美雷。他們兩人在英國國會中是伯明漢雪蒂的代表者。</p>
<p>在國會　長期休會重開之前，下院對於內閣公開地有一次激烈的抨擊，要求確定政府對外交涉不包括英國領十問題的意向，並要求說明政府不討論這種問題，而各方對於這個英國主要政黨的有力部份，都覺得不滿意。無論英國政府的一般領袖如何說法，他們總是相信關於殖民地問題已經有過紳士協定了。</p>
<p>現在讓我們　再看西班牙的最近事件。按照國際公法，這個紊亂多事的區域，其地位是狠顯明的。不論它的功過如何，複雜情形如何，國際間承認的西班牙政府總是紙有一個。它在世界各國都派有外交代表。它以友邦外交的關係要求與償付一種特質上的幫助，顯然是各國所應盡的義務，决不會發生什么中立問題，至於要施以禁運軍火那便是非友誼的行動。</p>
<p>再像供給軍火　金錢與其他助力於叛軍方面以反抗各國所承認的西班牙政府，這明明是侵略行為。這種侵略行為意國和德國兩國政府在叛亂暴發的前後已經觸犯著了。英國政府起初的態度是對的。西班牙海軍以政府的名義向直布羅陀海峽運取軍火之類，並沒有受到實際的阻礙，雖然這種探辦不狠容易。政府方面的傾向要去觀察在兩個爭執團體之間的所謂嚴格的中立；不過這在承認的政府和叛軍之間不容去劃分出來的。</p>
<p>法國政府　和法國國會的大多數欲直接幫助西班牙政府，這却是完全合法的行動；不過法國總理勒倫氏畏縮不前，一半的原因是希望有一個普遍的協定不供給軍火於任何一方，一半的原因是懷疑英國的態度。</p>
<p>這種延宕　反而有利於叛軍方面的處偽幫助者了。然而，照上述的話，法西斯的西班牙若和歐洲的法西斯集團聯合起來之後，將給英帝國以重大的危險。英國政府對於法國的冷淡態度和對於西班牙政府的沒有好感，除非假定英國的政微在考慮改變方面之外，是難於予以說明的。如果英國不欲加入法西斯集團、那末西班牙叛軍的勝利將使英國蒙受許多危險。</p>
<p>意國　在佔領東菲之後，百廢待舉、和德國重整軍備尚未全部完成，它們對於英國的態度如不預先測度而遽然採取授助西班牙叛軍的危險手段，這也色不易設想的事情。</p>
<p>實在這種　行動違反國聯盟約第十條，這顯然是侵略事件。當美國南北戰爭之際英國所受的困難，我們總還沒有忘却吧</p>
<p>所以西班牙政府倘然能夠獲各勝利的話，在理論我們可以利用國聯整個的機構，用制裁或他種方法，要求損害賠償，執行損害賠償的給付，或其他補償·總之德國意國的這種行動，沒有得到英國的一些秘密諒解，决非熟悉現勢的觀察家所能深信，否則至少和控制最後政策的英國政府的一部份有一種諒解。</p>
<p>若然鮑爾溫，麥唐納，張伯倫這一個朋黨保持在英國內閣的勢力，英國和德國的秘密協定勢將立即完成。</p>
<p>照這樣的　情形看起來，英國實在母庸再自詡為德法之間的拉攏者。事態不久必將有新的轉變，現在我們尚不易預言其最後的結局。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本强化外滙管理</h3>
<p>— 禹</p>
<p>本月八日本大藏省發布强化外國匯兌管理命令。其主要點是在嚴密統制外匯的賣買。限制入口貨價的價付。這項非常的措置可說是現階段日本經濟危機所產生的必然的結果。</p>
<p>日本自從加緊實行其所謂“積極政策”以來。內部陷於非常杌隉的境地。尤其是資金的空虛。為經濟上金融上所受的最大打擊。因為軍需工業剝奪了一般生產事業。使正常的再生產無從推進而一切有用的資金則幾乎全都消耗在不生產性的軍備上面了。同時入超激劇增加。現金不斷外流。愈益動搖金融市場的基礎。據統計。前年的入超為一千四百七十五萬八千元。去年就到了一億三千零十七萬五千元。增加十倍光景。去年付出國外的黃金。竟至達二億五千萬元之巨這决非貧窮的日本所能支撑下去。的為繼續强化其所謂“國防”的充實計為切實執行其所谓“準戰時體制”計保存現金是絕對必要的。最近昭和十一年度龐大預算的公布。就具體地表𨝔出日本對於資金需求的迫切。</p>
<p>新發布的强化匯兌管理命令。其基本作用也就在於統制資金的進出。大藏省主要的企圖是想藉對外匯付的限制。以减少資金的外流。同時。更想運用限制進口貨的手段縮减一般商品的進口而徉輸入貿易上着力於軍需品及軍需原料。以遂行其一貫的擴軍政策。可是我們却下能替日本當局樂觀。上述法令顯有不少的矛盾性。第一要减少入超或社絕入超而轉超出超。除限制輸入外同時必須增進輸出但目前世界市場却巳不允許日自由活動。據說跟日本有貿易關係的一百二十七國中。抵制日貨者竟達七十四國。可見日本輸出貿易的前途了。第二日本原料生產極端缺乏。軍需工業既無窮的擴展。則原料輪入當然也將無窮的增大。如果這種情形不變。則日本終必至像當前的德國。弄得外匯資金流盡為止。</p>
<p>自然。最後的手段還可採直接的通貨膨賬。但這一手段反將促進日本經濟的加速崩潰。是可斷言的。就國內說。通貨膨脹徒然使人民更趨窮困。加強革命的因素。至少也會减損人民負担租稅和消納公債的能力。使租稅政策和公債政策更趨破產。至就國外說。匯兌傾銷的方式。恐怕再不能像過去－般的須利了。脆弱的日圓。怎能當得住英美法貨幣聯合戰綫的一擊呢。</p>
<p>總之。日本經濟已達最嚴重的階段。强化匯兌管理至多也只能緩和經濟危機于一時而己。一看這一二天來日匯混亂到甚至無人過問的情景。則日後的通貨膨脹。恐怕還是難以避免的。</p>
<p>這裏。我們再就我們自身所處的地位。設想一下吧。我們不能忘記中國正是“積極政策”下最直接的對象。單就經濟上說。以後日本在他處碰壁的貨物必將洪水一般汜謐到中國來。同時。中國的原料也必將給日本大量捆載以去。在這種情勢之下。我們還可不再積極籌謀自衛麼。</p>

<h3>西班牙叛軍續向京城猛攻</h3>
<p>採密集戰法損失重大　守軍沉着抵抗未稍餒</p>
<p>瑪德里　國民軍昨今兩日向京城猛烈進攻、但因政府軍拼命拆抗之故、攻勢業巳稍衰、緣國民軍係採密集進攻之法、其所受損失頗為重大也、綜觀國民軍對於現代作戰方法頗為熟諳、所用戰具均係最新式者、即如國民軍飛機黑夜轟炸時輒放火箭、視察地面情形、然後拋擲炸彈、又本日午後叛軍砲隊轟擊之前、亦先由飛機向轟擊目標投擲烟彈、以資瞄準、諸如此類、不勝歷舉、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　本社訪員特訊、瑪德里附郭最近一星期來、雖已發生劇戰、但政府軍沉着抵抗、迄未稍餒、國民軍所採戰略、乃係佯為退卸誘敵前進、以圖一逞、但政府軍細心傎察之後並未深入、凡無暇設防各陣地概予放棄、上星期日國民軍所奪回者即係此等地方、至政府所屬民團在西北郊亞伐加鎖一帶則抗戰極烈、並曾突破國民軍壕溝至為得手、目下瑪德里通往愛斯哥里爾城之公路確已被切斷、但他處公路尚可照常通行因而京北瓜達拉瑪山地守軍糧食仍可源源接濟、無虞匱乏、準此而論、若謂瑪德里現巳轉危為安、固屬言之過早、但京城守軍此際己有喘息餘地、而戰事前途亦較有望、則可斷言云、（十日吟瓦斯電）</p>
<p>瑪德里　本社訪員特訊、政府軍蝗在瑪德里西郊加薩特圖巴公園、劇戰結果、陣亡者計達三百餘人之多、迨至午後戰事尤為激烈、機關槍軋軋之聲、終日不絕、直至日落時始已、但國民軍陣地上空、未見政府軍飛機、反之、國民軍所屬飛機三十架、則在瑪德里上空、往來㢠翔、歷時甚久、一般人以為瑪德里西北面愛斯哥里爾城日夕即當陷落、該處駐軍僅能控制小路數條、所屯軍火因而未易撤至後方云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>［華盛頓］德國在西班牙屬摩洛哥境內活動情形、現為各報所密切注意、各晚報所載社論、均明白指出歐洲時局混亂、德意兩國應負其責、其中如“明星晚報”謂、“倫敦方面關於不干涉西班牙內戰之談判、勢必延𡧣時日、結果徒足以有利於西班牙叛軍、俾藉德意兩國之援助（德意兩國志願兵現已密巢西國境內）而獲致最後之勝利、日後不干涉辦法調整委員會即欲有所行動、但叛軍已獲戰勝、法西斯派已植其政權於西班牙全境、噬臍莫及、此則吾人所深為疑慮者也、“新聞報”則謂“今若有人欲引起國際之糾紛、則唯德國元首希特勒是已、三載以來、希特勒迭將各項國際條約加以踐踏、其故有三、凡爾賽條約簽訂以後、全世界人士多向德國人民表示同情、此其一也、英法兩闕暨德國之其他隣邦對於德國之挑釁行動、寧願加以忍受、而不欲以武力相報復、此其二也德國之各隣邦未能始終團結一致、此某三也、今則不然、希特勒所處局勢、巳與前時大不相同、英法兩國對於德國在摩洛哥之活動、斷不能郭視無覩、任其自然、蓋若德國在摩洛哥一旦得逞、則無異坐令德國由南北兩路進攻法國、並截斷法國興摩洛哥之交通故也、希特勒茍尚未完全失却理性、則或適可而止、勿為己甚歟”云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］政府機關報伊斯雜希亞報、頃就意德兩國關於禁止志願兵赴西班牙一事之覆文、加以評論、略謂“就此項復文、可見意德兩國用意在於加緊干涉西班牙內亂、此層無待分析、覆文內容即可見之、蓋法西斯國家在西班牙之一舉一動、均為世人所共見共聞、德意兩國一方面送致覆文、另一方而則兩國軍隊正在瑪德里城下、襲擊西國共和軍之陣地、此固盡人皆知之事實也、且不僅在西班牙本國為然、即在西屬摩洛哥、其民政輿軍政權力實際上亦巳握於外國干涉者之手中、而尤以德國為甚、為今之計、凡志在和平而無意發動戰爭之各國、惟有團結一致、方足阻止法西斯國家使其無法實現其陰謀”云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>蘆鹽出口交涉僵持</h3>
<p>日方希望跌價我則未允　冀東偽組織謀佔各塲灘　私鹽侵入平津影響稅收</p>
<p>天津通信、蘆鹽出口一事、今猶成為華北中日間相持不下問題、去歲上方以製化學用鹽為名、由三菱公司訂購七萬噸、當局以是舉乃破五十年來未有之例、攷慮至再、方准外運、所訂契約、原限一年、客冬即已失效、今歲日方需要蘆鹽數目、較去歲多出數倍、預定小則二十五萬噸、多則三十萬噸、改由興中公司訂購、年前駐津日本領館、曾派商務副領事永井洵一。偕興中公司駐津理事平山•與長蘆各灘塲灶戶、直接洽商、蓋欲越過我官方手續、免有困難、以遂其採購之心、但灘灶戶多以去年售出鹽斤、每噸收價不過二元四角、成本尚且不足、無利可獲、對於外售一事、頗為冷淡、雖灘灶戶去年為蘆鹽輸出事、設有盧豐商店、專責辦理、該商店今雖未撤、然亦無意承辦、故與中公司此次直接接洽、并無結果、最近乃復向長蘆鹽運使署續商、運署根據一般灘灶戶之報告、深覺現在漢沽新河各灘存鹽、除供給華北市塲外、至多不過有十萬噸餘額、日方擬購二十五萬噸至三十萬噸、此在數量上、已無以應命、至於價目、去年每噸二元四角、灘灶戶均虧貼呌苦、苦依興中公司之意、本年購價、非但不增、反欲跌至二元一角一噸、實難成交、運署以為灘戶索價最低不得少於三元一噸、的屬最公允之數、倘日方能在十萬噸數量內購買、可代向灘戶斡旋、價格略减、每噸可在二元九角至二元九角六分之間、若彼此有意時、運署猶不能擅專、必須請示財部批準後、方可實行、此事截至近今、表面上談洽、己歸停頓、日方正別謀途徑、擇便捷方法、以求遂其目的也、</p>

<p>唯生學會宣言、唯心乎、唯物乎、近數十年來、禁迴國人腦際中者、恐當以此間題為最深重了、唯心論者、陷於迷信、固事保守、往往為社會進步的障礙物、唯物論者、淪入狂暴、有如盲目的炸彈一樣、徙增革命的浪費、尤以唯物主義、披着革命的外衣、邪說侵入、更易著魔、成千成百的青年學子、會在這上面枉費了精神腦力、成千成萬的勞動工人、曾為此而白白的犧牲失業、更有幾十萬的士兵和人民、為了這唯物主義的作祟、而顛沛流離、屍骨成山、離今不多時的西安事變、和動者便也是在不知不覺之中、受了唯物邪說的麻醉、不惜為國家民族的罪人、我們有感於這些可慘痛的事實、便覺得對三民主義理論的闡揚、尢其是三民主義在哲學基礎方面的理論的確立、確是萬分切耍了、“生是宇宙的中心、民生是人類歷史的中心、”這兩句話、便是孫中山先生韋侖鉀論的基礎、現在三民主義的政極已經確立、哲學理論的建立、當然是愈見重要了、陳立夫先先近年所屢屢講述的唯生論、就是根據了孫中山先生的民生史觀、而更以科學方法證明其確實的一種哲學理論、這種哲學理論、可以說是從五千年的中國文化歷史中間、揭發出來的寶藏、闡揚唯生論的理論、光大民生史觀的學說、不但可以開除迷信、消弭亂源、更將從文化上從精神上、恢復民族的自信力、臻國家民族於復與强盛的境、中國的强盛、中國的復興、端賴於中國自己的力量、端賴於中國自己的文化、而這個力量與文化的最基本的絛件、便是哲學理論的建立、唯生論的哲學概念、具體而嚴密的建立起來、使民族的力量有所發揮、民族的文化有所歸宿、則一切均可施政有緒、建設有方、踏上民族復興的大道、我們感於唯生哲學的重要、全國青年在唯心唯物二者之間、徘徊歧途的痛苦、故集合對於哲學問題、有研究興趣的青年七百餘人、冀藉組織方式的群策群力的研究、對舉國急需的唯生哲學、能够有所補益、吾人在此、須特加說明的、約有數端、㊀哲學的學院式的研究、顯非吾輩所可能、“經院學派”一類的哲學理論、對目前奔騰激蕩中的社會、亦未必有何助力、吾輩大多數剛正出了學校之鬥、正求為社會服務、即有尚留學校中者、亦離服務社會的日期不遠、吾人不能以學生生活終其身、而遲早必須作一“社會人”、故吾人對於唯生哲學的研究、自始即須是實現的、反對一切空想的學院式的、吾人必須在生活中去體驗哲學、在社會服務與奮門的歷程中、研求哲學的進展、㊁由於我們研究哲學的態度、是現實的、是與我們的實生活、絕不分離的、所以就影響到我們這個集團的性質、即是我們不單以研究學術的方式來集合、而且是以革命的求為社會服務的方式來集合的、我們的各個份子、不單在學格上互相發生關係、我們更將在生活上發生密切的聯繋、陳立夫先生在唯生論的請演中說、西洋人最初發現了“熱”是物質的重心、和物質的動力、中國人則最初發現了“誠”是精神的重心、和精神的動力、所以我們這個集㔹的結合、應該是“親愛精誠”的結合、在學術上是互相砥礪、在生活上是更要做到互助共信、㊂我們深信、空漠的冥想的學理、無補於事實、而為文化基礎及革命動力之源的哲學真諦、更要在實際的為社會服務的生活中、繼能體驗得到、故我們在會員生活的互助上、期其做到職業保障、職業介紹、低利借欵、特種保險等事、而在革命與對社會服務方面、更必須每一個會員都能夠刻苦努力、實際深入社會、始終服役於人、國勢蜩螗、巳至最後階段、吾人謹以危國滅種的戒懼之心、集平素相處的青年同志、本着自力自救的信念、為個人謀生路、更為國家求生存、尚祈邦人君子、隨時匡正、</p>

<h3>上海烏市調查</h3>
<p>每年外輸二百萬元　擬組集團統制貿易</p>
<p>鳥類在本市、不特為主要消閒品之一、且每年由各產地運滬、轉輸國外者為數極鉅、同時國外產烏來華、又必須由滬入口、是以本市實為唯一烏類集散市塲、神州社記者茲將上海烏市概况調查誌次、</p>
<p>全年營業三百萬元</p>
<p>查現時流行鳥類、純屬於觀賞一種、其中信鴿一類、雖在觀賞以外、但產銷與畜養數量、與前者相較、已極徵弱、至食用烏類、普通亦僅鴿雀及鳩等、在市塲上每年營業總值、近年來亦不足三萬元、有日形沒落之勢、但本市雖為國內外鳥類集散市塲、然滬市並無若何鳥類生產本市鳥市、全年營業總值雖達三百萬元、然本市自有消費量、年僅二十五萬元左右、约達進出口總數十分之一、</p>
<p>滬市有鳥二百萬頭</p>
<p>本市鳥類畜養最廣者、首為魯產之芙蓉、次為浙產之繡眼、復次為灤東遼產之百靈畫眉等、浙產之黃雀、以及魯產之鵪鶉、因性善鬥、故亦為中下階級所喜、其數量亦均在十萬至十二萬頭左右、每年三四月間、在邑廟及四郊茶肆內並有大規模之鬥鳥集會、本市現有全部畜養鳥數、併合各類合計、约二百萬頭、全部價值、當在六七十萬元上下、民國二十年前後、鳥市全年營業、僅本市一處營業、已逾五十萬元、近三四年來因社會經濟蕭條、遂逐漸遞减而至二十五萬元左右、若無大量出口貿易維持、所謂鳥市、寶將全部崩潰、本市鳥市集中豫圍、大小共四十餘家、範圍較大者、資本亦須萬元左右、小者亦在千元以上、至經營對外輸出者、皆須有較鉅資本、始能勝任、至附屬營業之鳥籠、每年銷出總值、亦可四五千元、</p>
<p>外輸最鉅想思芙蓉</p>
<p>每年經山本市輸出國外之鳥類、總值始終在百萬元上下、其銷路最廣者、首推浙產之想思鳥、每年輸出數约在三百五十萬隻、總值约百萬元其次為芙蓉、每年輸出數约在六萬五千隻、總值约十萬元其餘繡眼•百靈等、合計亦達七八十萬元、其初鴛鴦每年輸出亦值數十萬元、現因政府嚴禁雞類及鴛鴦類出國、現已毫無輸出、至由國外輸入者、大多為鸚鵡•嬌鳳•芙蓉•等類、其中芙蓉一項、我國亦有出產、且有大量輸出、其價亦甚廉、每隻僅值二元至六元但因外產者品格較優、故每年仍有自德•荷•美•挪威等國輸入、其中以德種最優、每隻自五六十元起、至二百左右止、然外鳥每年輸入有限、尚不足我輸出之半數、</p>
<p>組織集團統制外銷</p>
<p>本市經營鳥業者、雖有四十餘家、但因營業競爭過烈、且大多目光短淺、因此迄今尚無組織、惟每日上午、在邑廟內樂意樓茶社、有會議性質之談話會、至養鳥之較著者、大多集合於豫園之得意樓、餘則多集於其他茶肆內、每日由晨至晚、提鳥携籠者紛然集合多者至數十頭、彼此參觀比較、互相研討、充塞屋隅者、盡嚶嚀鳴啾之聲實洋洋大觀、今年烏商、雖能略有盈餘、然外銷盡握外商之手、受彼操縱、我反形成附庸、故若干覺悟之烏商現擬排除過去彼此孤立競爭狀態、共同組織一統制集團、求對外之出路、惟大部鳥商泯於成見、致遲遲未能實現、同時本國產鳥雖多、然因交通阻碍、運輸困難較遠各地產鳥、均難運到滬在對外貿易上當亦一損失、</p>

<h3>郵政常識問答（六）</h3>
<p>問　購買國內匯票有何手續、</p>
<p>答　匯欵人應向郵局匯兌窗口索取“請購國內匯票單”、或稱“普通匯單”、一紙、將匯欵數目、匯欵人及受欵人之姓名住址、一一填入、填寫時應注意左列各項、</p>
<p>一•匯欵若干匯欵數字應填寫清晰、切勿潦草模糊、免致錯誤、</p>
<p>二•要否收欵回帖郵局備有一種單式、連同匯票交由匯欵人寄給受欵人、俾受欵人於兌欵時、在單內留備地方簽各蓋戳、隨同匯票、（匯票上亦須簽名蓋戳）持向兌欵局兌欵、然後由兌欵　將該項單式退回匯欵　、送交匯欵人收執以作受欵人業經收到匯欵之憑證、此項單式、名曰一收欵回帖每張納費八分、要否聽便、如果需要、匯欵人應在、“請購國內匯票單”、相關欄內註明“要”字、否則註明“否”字、</p>
<p>三•匯欵人姓名住址應祥細填寫、俾所匯欵未經受欵人於有效期間兌領時、匯欵局可於相當時期內、函知匯欵人領回、</p>
<p>四•受欵人姓名住址更應詳細清晰書寫、姓名尤須眞確無訛以免受欵人兌欵時之簽名蓋章與單內所書者不相符合、而致遲延兌欵清事、</p>
<p>五•兌付局名郵局為便利公衆起見、凡設有郵局而同時設有郵政支局之地方、各該郵政支局大都可兌付匯票、故兌欵地方如係設有一處或數處郵政支局者、匯欵人應將距離受欵人住址最近並能兌付匯票之郵政支局、在“請購國內匯票單”兌付局名欄內注明、俾受欵人就近在該支局兌欵、以資便捷例如受欵人住在上海霞飛路一帶、滙欵人應在兌付局名欄內寫明霞飛路支局、如僅寫上海郵局或上海字樣、則受欵人須赴北四川路上海郵政管理局兌取、</p>
<p>請購國內滙票單填畢後、連同滙欵、交給郵局經辦滙兌人員點收、由其核算滙費、滙費付清後、即山經辦滙兌人員開發匯票、填具收據（即係請購國內滙票單之下聯）、如要回帖、連同帖一併交與滙欵人查收、再由滙欵人將該項滙票、如有回帖、連同回帖、封入信內作掛號或快遞掛號寄遞、其匯票收據、則應妥為保存、以便匯票遺失或遇有查詢時、作為憑證、</p>
<p>又匯欵人每次講買匯票時、除向郵局素取此項匯票收據外、務須同時索取匯票、自行封入信內、切勿僅取收據、而將信函交給郵局匯兌人員、托其代為封寄匯票、</p>

<h3>埠際足球初次試賽理想隊獲小勝</h3>
<p>五比三倖勝勞逸爾　上半時一比二落後</p>
<p>埠際足球試賽、理想隊昨在申園與駐滬英軍勞逸爾隊、作第一次試賽、名後衛馬山兒未出席、增選法商之勃琪斯補其缺、漏洞極多、勞隊聲勢甚盛、曾於十分鐘內以二比○前導、上半時結果、尚以二比一佔先、理想隊賴下半時之努力、方以五對三倖勝昨日申園門前、雖汽車如陣、但一元座上僅滿三分之二、半元座則更形寥落、總計不足二千人、戰情如下、</p>
<p>勞逸爾佔先</p>
<p>擇位既畢、理想隊得背日之利、並得開球之權、申園塲地、昨尚濘滑、交鋒後、雙方均不易把捉、勞隊乘機進廹、左路挺進、勃琪司失足、鮑賽仲仆地未起、勢甚危廹、幸馮運佑趕到、送成角球、未曾隕越、理想隊反攻、小華特二傳、進抵門下、僅差一綫、未曾成功、五分鐘時、勞隊泊洛美深入、轉遞左翼、克列頓傳中、勃極司舉足踏住、不意弄巧成拙、演成倒戈、先行奉送一球、埠際兩翼反攻極活動、但無進展、十分鐘時、軋許運球失誤、中途被刧、勞隊全師圍攻、夏泊射門、鮑賽仲身彈出未遠、兩衛茫然呆住、被毛列斯撥入空門、理想隊於十分鐘內、連失二球、積極反攻、勞勃司托夫得機射門、中柱横彈留球門綫上、麥克耐來重行接出、因判無效、徒成畫餅、相持至二十五分鐘、傑姆華特底綫傳中、中右柱及守門身、孫錦順衝入一撥、遂穿網底、成一比二、此後理想隊曾有多次攻門、一次推勒開角球、恰落門下、守門高托未着、爲耶兹用身一倘、克列克勾出險境、一次推勒傳中、小華特讓門空路、孫錦順平射鋭急、爲麥克耐來接獲、上半時遂以此渡過、勞隊以二比一佔先、</p>
<p>理想隊反勝</p>
<p>再戰後、理想隊即從右路進展、初試未成、方一分鐘、格林勃鋭進、遠傳中路、孫錦順於離門十五碼處、俯身勾射、勞門方伺于左、遂擦地進網右角、理想隊方追成二比二平等、勞隊反攻、克列頓傳中、馮躍起用頭擋出、球爲夏泊司截獲、舉足即射、適落左柱側、雹賽仲雙手拍出、幸未肇禍、險極、理想隊攻勢轉盛、惜華特射門偏出、軋許得鎭和接濟、於三十碼處遥射、脚頭雖硬、惜偏牛尺、十五分鐘時、小華特遠傳、格林勃於門下截住、一蹴而入、方於三比二超出、詎中綫開球後、勞隊已席捲而至、中路二鋒齊上、毛列斯主射、球勢甚緩、雹賽仲出迎、過於大意、竟遭失足、球盤旋於球門綫上、毛列斯趕上撥進、三比三又成平局、距前球祗一分鐘、此後勞隊又形蓬勃、理想隊腹地、又數頻於危、相持許久、方脱離困境、勞勃司托夫進抵敵門、因缺乏接應、失去良機、幸未幾格林勃衝進、麥克耐萊出迎漏空、格林勃遂撥入空門、四比三理想隊再度超出、勞隊左衛法列門亦因刧格林勃之球而受傷、此後勞隊攻勢甚猛、幸於終場前二分鐘時、勞勃托夫單騎深入、乘兩衛出迎時、舉足猛射、從網頂彈入網角、未幾笛聲起處、理想隊遂以五對三倖勝、</p>
<h3>字林盃複賽優游測量</h3>
<p>得决賽權</p>
<p>震旦俄軍淘汰</p>
<p>字林盃昨日複賽、優游與在乙組聯賽中同分之震旦隊「相逢於膠州公園、優游聲勢甚盛、交鋒約一刻鐘、即由左鋒戈錫佐打開紀錄、旋左翼沈世琦又執行十二碼球中的、以二比○領先上半時、再戰後、左翼沈柏貴、又中一球、此後優游機會極多、而震旦攻勢亦盛、其前鋒進展亦極迅速、終以優游捍禦有方、未爲所乘、遂以三對○淘汰震旦、另塲字林盃複賽、俄軍對測量隊、仍在虹口公園舉行、俄軍事眔踞乙組下賽首席、測量則没没無聞、事前預測、測量當不堪俄軍之一擊、詎交鋒結果、俄軍以輕敵太甚、反以四對一爲測量所淘汰、此後决賽週中、將由優游與測量互爭盟主、陣容如下、</p>
<h3>初級杯複賽進德初級</h3>
<p>得决賽權</p>
<p>震旦薩伐淘汰</p>
<p>初級盃足球、昨與字林盃同日舉行複賽、相逢者爲晨聯之震旦與進德、及丙組之薩伐亞與初級、交鋒結果、進德雖遭逢勁敵、終以技高一着得從容應付、前半時净獲四球、後半則成四比二、總結果以八對二淘汰震旦、獲得决賽權、另組薩伐亞、雖以六戰六勝、榮列丙組聯賽首席、詎竟爲四遭敗仗之初級會以六對四所淘汰、此後决賽週中進德將與初級會爭奪初級盃錦標、初級雖較高一級、但進德實力充足、恐初級難攖其鋒芒也、昨日進德出塲陣容如下</p>

<h3>一年來的上海金融</h3>
<p>— 魏友棐</p>
<p>（一）統年的金融市况</p>
<p>從全國的經濟表面現象上觀察，如果將二十四年度認作恐慌爆發的一時期，那末，無疑地，二十五年度的全國經濟，已從經濟蕭條時期，而略顯示抬頭了。這情形，即從上海一年來的金融市况上可以看出。這一年中，金融業的興替，非常地稀少；拆息也常年顯示平穩而弛緩，工商業的活動，比上年度固有轉機，但也不怎樣景氣。總之，全年的金融上一切動態，都在平淡無奇的狀態中，金融上的供給與需要，也都很遲鈍。</p>
<p>在叙述一年來上海金融市况之前，這裏先把國內經濟變動的略介紹。</p>
<p>財政方面，繼新貨幣法令之後，在二十五年度二月，當局公布了整理公債案，其內容是發行統一公債十四萬六千萬元，換償以前已發行的內國公債庫劵憑證；又另發行復興公債三萬四千元，作爲健全金融基礎，平衡國庫收支之。用兩共十八萬萬元，利率均爲周年六釐，先後於二月一日，三月一日發行。此項巨額公債的發行，在我國公債史上尚屬創舉。把參差不齊的許多公債都在統一名稱下整理起來，在公債史上也是創舉。六月末，二十五年的國家總預算公布，並同時宣稱此後將注重直接税的徵收，八月即公布施行所得税條例，定二十六年一月份起絡續實行，此外在籌備徵收的直接税，尚有遺産税等。</p>
<p>貨幣方面成立了兩種恊定，都從外電的公布而得證實。一種是五月間的中美貨幣恊定，恊定的內容雖没有正式公布，但從各方面的消息歸納下來，大約是美國向中國購買白銀五千萬盎斯至七千萬盎斯，將該項所得存在美國，即作爲我國外匯的平凖基金。一種是十月間的中英信用借欵恊定，其內容也没有正左公布，最初的傳説，是由英國貸給中國五百至一千萬，鎊作爲溝通兩國貿易，以及平凖匯兑之用。其時適在我國外交緊張時期，中英借欵的成立，尤予各關係國以重大的妒忌與注意，結果宣布，僅乎是一種出口信用放欵，但無疑在我國對英匯市的穩定上，有相當的力量。西妃把這兩件恊定歸納起來，前者可以説我國在美國的匯兑基金，後者是我國在英國的滙兑基金，都予新幣制基礎以安定的力量。</p>
<p>一般經濟方面可以特别注意的，是華北走私事實的擴大，到了二十五年的四五月以後，走私的嬗進更加厲害，不但華北的税收大受影響，因走私地域的擴大，使全國的税收都感影鄉，走私商品的傾銷，更予全國産業以重大威脅。比較規模稍大的平津一帶紡織業，成乎全給外資屯併了，其中一部分原因是受着走私的賜予。</p>
<p>這年度的最初一月，國際貿易曾一度顯示出超，開五十年來貿易史的新紀錄，但數字是非常細微。本年的全國農作物，如米穀小麥，棉花之類，幸都豐收，農作物的價格，也因着海外的需要，尚還穩定，因此農村的經濟，比上年是活動了。</p>
<p>三月間，上海票據承兑所成立，八月間粤省的貨幣整理就緒，這都是本年全國金融上重要的設施。</p>
<p>因着全國經濟顯示着平靖，而骨子裏一切恐慌的原子還未盡消除，所以上海的金融市况所表現出來的，是終年遲鈍不進的現象。到了秋季以後，雖因農村經濟稍形活動而推動了一部份，但是反映到金融上面，仍還很微細，只不過在未來，增加幾分生機罷了。因爲我國都市金融的復興，最主要的原素，是農村對商品需要的增加，因而使工商業的信用制度重新恢復，使金融的活動力量增加。但在這次恐慌以後，不論在計劃與力量上，都有使工商業與金融業都不敢把範圍過分擴大，所以即使農村購買力逐漸恢復，而金融上表面繁榮的復見，還是離開很遠的。</p>
<p>歷年的金融季節，因習慣上關係，仍不能脱離舊曆每三個月一小結束的狀態，但在今年意外地却看不出來。這因爲金融上的需求關係，環境造就他長期停滯着，一切表面形態，反而似乎很穩定的樣子。</p>
<p>從一月到三月這一季，一月下旬恰是二十四年大結束期，因了新幣制的施行，把籌碼缺乏的恐慌消除了，所以預想很不平安的二十四年結束期，終於很平安地過去了。紙幣的發行額從上年度十月的四萬萬元，擴大到八萬萬元，（其中包括換發雜鈔數字）可見需要之一般。二月是舊歷的正月，本是很閒散的月份。三月，拆息稍形活動，但金融業對於本年的放欵，仍主張收縮。整理公債案發表以後，因爲此後公債收益的减少，使公債價格回下。現銀的存底，因出運國外，比往年减少。海外銀市，從上年十月以來，仍在二十便士左右。據一般人觀察，大概是由於美國不願在倫敦購銀，藉以防止我國將白銀完全出售，成爲一非用銀國家，或者竟加入了英鎊集團。因爲銀價跌落，我國出售白銀換回英鎊，就會比較不便宜。這裏中美貨幣恊定成立的預告，已有端倪可見。</p>
<p>三月間，上海銀行票據承兑所成立，在金融市塲中，增加信用籌碼，對於貼現事業，自可因此促進。中國農民銀行，並且奉財部命令，發行紙幣一萬萬元，以五千萬元投資農村。</p>
<p>四月是工商業長期放欵的小結束期，市况仍極穩定。拆息在月初略有活動，但大體是很穩定的，比之往年同期的高昂情形，更是不可同日而語了，五月中美貨幣恊定成立以後，世界銀市又趨穩定，我國外債在海外市塲，也有漲上；一交到六月，因了華北走私的逐漸擴大，影響及整個外匯；以及兩粤的異動消息，使國內公債市價與國外市價都趨於下跌。白銀續有運出，存底虽然减少，但因爲現銀在國內，只作爲法幣凖備金之用，所以於市面籌碼，並不生直接影響，外埠的現銀，却繼續有運入。這一季是春繭登塲的時期，中央中民國交通三行主辦放欵銀團三千萬元。參加的計銀行十九家，錢莊一家。</p>
<p>七月以後，因了農村的豐收，各貨銷路的推動，市况略呈活氣，但是地産事業仍維持幾年來萎敝情形，没有生色。上海的現銀存底雖有輸入，但輸往美國作爲匯兑平凖金之用者更多。粤局安定以後，當局復公布改革粤幣計劃，從此廣東毫洋，也在統一的道途中。九月末，法國放棄金本位，上海標金市價曾漲到一千一百六十元以上，是幣制改革後的新高價。</p>
<p>十月到十二月這一季，十月又是長期放欵的結束期，但因爲交易的缺少，農作物豐收，市面遂顯得寛裕，復有往年緊張的現象。中英借欵恊定消息傳來以後，一般人對我國商業金融的前途，更顯示樂觀。上海的物價，從十月份起，即日趨高昇，十一月以後，上昇的趨勢更厲害。紗，花，米，麥，以及呢羢布疋之類，更有驚人的漲起。十二月以後，物價更活躍。紗價一度漲到二百六十八元，是有紗市以來的新高價。十二月中旬，因了西安事變，市况曾一度有緊張的反響，但經過尚還良好。</p>
<p>總之，這一年中的金融市况，長年是鬆散的。其原因，一方面是因了幣制改革後籌碼的增多，使通貨緊縮的象現，因而解除。一方面因了，産業不發達金融的需要遂極爲閒散。農民購買力的推動，雖是造成物價上漲原因之一，但顯然是超過了購買力擴張的成分，並不能説是經濟復興的景象。所以金融市况的復興，也不是短時期內可見的事。下面是全年的拆息情形：（單位分）</p>
<p>（二）法幣發行與匯價物價</p>
<p>爲了上海在全國地位的特殊重要，因而從上海各銀行的法幣發行額，可以明瞭大部份的籌碼活動狀態。這裏先介紹一年來法幣發行與匯價物價的過程：</p>
<p>一年來法幣發行及匯價物價指數</p>
<p>上面法幣發行額，關金是在外的，發行的銀行包括中央，中國，交通，浙江興業，中國實業，四行，四明，通商，墾業，中國農工，中國農民等。根據的日期，是每月的最後一期檢查報告。</p>
<p>依表上看出，法幣的發行額是逐月在增加中，從一月到十二月，大概增多到百分之四十五左右。但這個數字却不能作爲絶對標準，因爲自幣制改革以，民間的存銀，既逐漸由中央銀行收回，那末，紙幣的發行額自然將會加多，所以幣制改革以前究竟有多少流通數量，既無從捉摸，則到現在爲止，究竟增加了多少，也是無從判斷的。</p>
<p>從貨幣的外價（外匯）及內價（物價）上，却可以看出了一個逐漸下落，一個逐漸上昇的趨勢，但物價上昇的程度，却比匯價下落爲甚。上面舉的是外匯總指數，我們若果把對各國的外匯情形分開來説，那末，終年的英匯尤爲安定。物價的上昇爲什麽比外匯下落爲厲害，很明顯地可以説，是由於後者由當局管理的結果，而事實上外匯的買賣，跟掛牌是略有加减的</p>
<p>這裏所舉的物價指數，還只是批發物價指數。它的上下是比較滯緩的。我們若把各主要商品分開來説，那末，物價上漲的趨勢，尤爲顯然。本年物價上漲的程序，大概可以分做兩期？一期是上半期的四月一季，下半期是十月以後。而後一期的上漲形勢，更引起了商業社會重大的注意與影響。一般的工商業，確曾有因了物價上騰的顯示幾分活氣的。但因爲物價的上漲，不盡爲真正的需要；而工商業在久困之後，活動能力極形薄弱，所以從利害方面權衡來説，似乎惡影響多於好影響，何况物價還在上漲中的呢？這裏所引證的，是上海有標凖商品的紗，棉，粉，麥四種：</p>
<p>一年來紗花粉麥市價表（單位元）</p>
<p>這裏所顯示的上漲趨勢，跟批發物價上漲的趨勢不同，那就是自始至終顯着扶摇直上的樣子。就拿花紗來説，往年是苦紗價太低，棉價太高，使紗廠無利可圖；本年不但棉價不低，而紗價更有驚人的漲起。十二月中，紗價尤隨時創造了新高峰，把棉價合成了紗價，不但不虧本，而且還可以得利。至於粉麥兩項，也是顯示歷年未有的新高價，而且還在向上。</p>
<p>物價的特殊向上，可以分做幾方面來説，第一自然是由於需要，需要大，則價格自會漲高；但這裏所説的需要，却不能指出真的消費需要，或人爲的需要。（投機與屯買）。其二是由於生産，花的生産因了美棉的减收而上漲，麥因出口增加而上漲。此外如世界供求狀况，以及法幣的刺激，當然也佔相當的成分。</p>
<p>西安事變突發以後，物價有急劇的變化，因了人心的恐慌，資本逃避的狀態尤爲顯明。標金衝出了一千一百七十元大關，購買英美外匯的約有一千萬元之鉅。粉，麥，紗，花，食糧一致高漲。在當局的嚴密管理下，外匯仍能維持安定，但是物價的反動，却是無法遏止。</p>
<p>總觀一年來的發行額，是在擴大着，外匯是安定着，而物價在上漲着。物價的上漲，雖有刺激工商業繁榮的可能性；但實際上我國經濟，全般仍極衰落，購買力增加極微；物價雖是可以因了需要而高漲，但物價的極度高漲，却可以使需要减少。所以對於現在粉，麥，紗，花，的高漲，連帶及其他物價高漲，既不能認爲是一種經常的結果，因此希望當局有管理的必要。</p>
<p>（三）重要商品與進出口貿易</p>
<p>上海在全國國際貿易的地位上，也佔據着首要的位置，上海一埠的貿易額，常佔據貿易額百分之五十至六十。因爲上海在全國交通上的特殊便利。所以不論進口或出口，都要彚集到上海來。我們從上海的進出口貿易情形裏，就可測知了全國貿易狀况的雛型。各種重要商品的榮辱，也可以當作全國一般商品榮辱的雛型。現在先介紹全年商品的情形，再介紹全年上海一埠的進出口貿易情形：</p>
<p>（一）絲　全年絲價，上半期比下半期爲旺，本年絲的出口量雖比較去年爲少，但價值上却比較爲多，就由於絲價的上漲。一月份高等廠經最高價達九百十五元，爲十九年以後的最高價。出口的各國，以美國，印度，日本爲多。國內的絲市，江浙一帶因受農民貸欵的佽助，又因絲價較高，所以在農民方面比較活動，但全年出産額不多。</p>
<p>（二）茶　全年茶價，以六七月間較高，祁門（紅茶）五月間平均漲至一九七元，針眉（綠茶）七月間平均漲至三十七元，爲近年之高價。出産量也較去年爲多。但出口的數額，却比往年爲沉寂。出口的國家，摩洛哥第一，俄第二。</p>
<p>（三）棉花　本年我國棉産豐收，據最後估計一千四百餘萬担，比去年多六百萬担，爲近年最高數。上半年棉價較小，下半年較好，比往年爲高。全年進口减少，出口增加。出口的第一位爲日本。</p>
<p>（四）棉紗　本年紗價下半期較上半期爲好，所以紗廠在下半期都能得利。紗的最高價爲二百六十八元，爲有市以來的最高價。本年生産量很少，市價的高貴，由於時局原因爲多。全年輸出比往年略少。</p>
<p>（五）米與小麥　本年全國豐收，據報告，安徽凡十四成收穫，江西也是十四成，湖北十成，比二十一年二十二年增收百分之三十以上。小麥産量比去年增收百分之十七，大麥增收百分之八，此外豆麥等收成都稱豐收。米麥的市價，比往年爲高，下半年尤甚。全年米麥進口减少，出口增加。</p>
<p>總之，各項商品，在産量方面説來本年比去年增加，在市價方面説來，也比去年增高，下半年激漲的趨勢，更爲加甚。所以囤積的商人，都能得利。</p>
<p>至於一年來的上海一埠貿易情形，列表如下：</p>
<p>一年來上海出入口貿易額（單位千元）</p>
<p>綜合十一個月貿易情形來説，進出口情形都比去年增加，而增加的月份，是四五月的一期，與八九月的一期比較略高。出口的最高額是八份，進口的最高額是五月份，入超頂大的一月是四月份。照往年的情形來説，四，五，八，九，這幾個月，本是輸出入的旺盛季。因爲一方面有絲茶米穀的出口，就可以交換了許多洋貨。一月份的出超，是五十年來的僅有情形，當時曾經引起全國學者的重大注意。現在把過去的事實分析下來，所以變成出超者，是由於輸出的略加，輸入的極度减少，是一種偶然際會，於整個的國際貿易是不發生重大影響的。</p>
<p>一年來輸出比較增多，輸入比較减少，但若折合金價計算，則變化很少。還有一種可注意的事實，是走私依然很厲害，上海雖不是著名的走私口岸，但由於走私的活躍，自然可使正規需要縮减，因而使上海的輸入减少。（按江海關全年税收比二十四年减二十五萬八千元）更可慮的一件事，是本年農作物徼倖豐收，而價格又很穩定，那末，農民購買力自然可以略爲加增。歷年史實告訴出來，所謂購買力的增加，往往是指點購買進口貨能力的增加，因了進口事業的活躍，可以促進都市與農村間商業交易活躍。所以今後的人超問題，倒是一個大問題。</p>
<p>（四）金融商業的興替</p>
<p>本年的金融事業，比去年穩定得多多了，也正同金融市况一般地顯示平穩，中央銀行有改爲中央凖備銀行之説，又訂立了（一）中央凖備銀行，（二）匯兑銀行，（三）實業銀行，（四）信託銀行，（五）不動産抵押銀行，（六）儲蓄銀行，（七）農業銀行，（八）工業銀行八種法規，銀行事業的發展，更顯示尖鋭化。從這八個銀行法規裏看出，今後的銀行力量的集中，更是意想中的事。事實上本年銀行的資本與存額，已有集中國家銀行的趨向了。</p>
<p>本年新設的金融機關，有：</p>
<p>（一）中央儲蓄會，屬於中央信託局，三月間開幕。</p>
<p>（二）生大信託公司，資本一百萬元，七月間開幕。</p>
<p>（三）廣東銀行，十二月復業。</p>
<p>停設的金融機關，有</p>
<p>（一）通易信託公司，（二）美華銀行，（三）華安銀行，（四）國泰銀行。</p>
<p>增資與改組的金融機關，有</p>
<p>（一）至中銀行，增資五十萬元，（二）綢業銀行，與江蘇銀行聯合經營，（三）四明銀行增資，（四）中滙江浙兩銀行合併。</p>
<p>本年成立的百萬元以上的銀行錢莊借欵，有（一）電政公債押欵六百萬元，（二）浙贛南萍段借欵一千萬元，（三）江浙春繭借欵三千萬元，（四）京滬杭路貸欵二百萬元，（五）浙江蠶絲統制會借欵五百萬元，（六）浙省府借欵四百萬元，（七）鐵道部借欵三百萬元，（八）湘省借欵一百四十萬元，（九）粤省借欵八百萬元，（十）湘米押滙銀團一千萬元等。</p>
<p>一般的業務狀况，大體從下列途徑中進行：（一）個别的趨向於集團進行，（二）業務範圍主張縮小，（三）經營的目標，趨於謹愼。所以，大借欵的成立，多於小借欵，由國家銀行共同經營的政治借欵，多於工商業小放欵。</p>
<p>一般的工商業情形，也比二十四年度略有進歩，現在介紹中國徵信所與各方的報告，則本年度九個月的工商業倒閉數大約如次：（四月以前根據經濟統計月志，五月以後根據中國徵信所調查。）</p>
<p>上海工商業閉歇數</p>
<p>廿三年　　　　　五一○　○廿五年五月　三六</p>
<p>廿四年　　　一、○六五　　　　　六月　七八</p>
<p>廿五年一月　　　一○八　　　　　七月　七一</p>
<p>二月　　　　七四　　　　　八月　五八</p>
<p>三月　　　　一九　　　　　九月　五九</p>
<p>四月　　　　二五　三年來合計二、一○三</p>
<p>根據數字上觀察，工商業的倒閉數字，比較去年减少得多。但在六月以後，倒閉的數字忽有增多，中國徵信所研究此中原因，爲「新創之數字，雖有可觀；惟倒閉之數字，竟將倍之，且營業未及三四月，即告改組或淸理者，更比比皆是，蓋市塲之購買力，迄未增加，而金融之週轉，亦仍凝滯也。」又據調查九月份工商業的新創者，達五十二家，開本年各月的新紀錄，該所推子㚖其原因是：「此種畸形之繁榮，乃係最近大批所謂嚮導社之出現使然，觀乎工業之疲憊不起與販賣業之逐歩衰退，依然爲市塲繁榮之重大障碍。然以本年情形與去年同期相對照，則本年本市工商業實已較去年情形轉好不少矣。」大概本年夏季以後，市塲的購買力稍形活動，所以一般商業經營家頗想乘機發展，但因爲環境不良，仍不免於失敗，這就是本年新創數與閉歇數增加的原由了。</p>
<p>本年離開經濟繁榮，雖還很遠，可是購買力較前增進，即倒是有例可舉的，例如中央銀行發表的生産指數，就表示大體在上昇着。這一種數字，是根據統税計算而得，其中包含着有外商的數字，但出産的增加，無論如何，消費量也在增加着，道是必然的。</p>
<p>又根據上海公用事業方面的報告，那末，在上海市特區本年十月份的商業，實有上昇的趨勢，因爲用電用水的消耗力都在增加着。關於商業方面的用電，比去年同期增加百分之九·四，實業方面，增加百分之十五·三。商業上用自來火，比去年同期增加百分之三十五，用於商業方面，增加百分之二十三。自來水與電話的消耗，也在增加。作成這一種報告的目標，或者是希望藉此證明上海逐漸繁榮，增加公用業的徵收費用不能作證。因爲公用事業的發達，也同上面生産指數一般，包括有在華外商的數字，離開繁榮二字，更是很遠，但公用方面消耗的增加，無疑地是在增加工作，而工作着是爲了生産。雖然生産者不見得是國貨工廠，而消費的則無疑地是中國人。</p>
<p>又一個證明是票據交換數，本年十個月的票據交換額，比去年爲增加。若以十月份與去年同期相比，則增加達百分之四十左右。</p>
<p>公債的成交數，則從統一公債發行以後有急劇的减下，十月份公債的成交數，不過二萬二千萬元，去年同期，則爲五萬二千萬元，减削百分之五十以上。這因爲公債在整理以後，在利息方面，顯然是减削了。</p>
<p>地産的交易，仍是非常淸淡，最近上海市的人口達三百八十多萬，比「一二八」時代加多了卅萬，但地産的需要仍不活躍。除了一月分因受法幣的刺激成交獨多外，（三八九萬元）但全年地産交易總數只有一萬二千萬元，比廿四年减少二百五十萬元。</p>
<p>由於公債地産的不活動，我們可以推知道兩種投資在金融市塲地位的不重要。</p>
<p>（五）一年來金融市况的批評</p>
<p>一年來的上海金融市况比上年表面上是好轉了，這好轉的顯示，是金融市况平静無事，是市塲購買力略有推動。前者是承襲恐慌以後，金融機關因守範圍的結果，後者則是因了農産物價格之穩定，農村豐收，世界景氣好轉的促成。就表面上看來，金融恐慌形態已轉變向上了。</p>
<p>從我國經濟本質上看，是一個長期入超的國家，進口貨比較多的一年，也就是表面經濟繁榮的一年。進口貨愈多，工商業者因然能够得利，金融市况也趨於活潑。這因爲上海這一個都市是通商口岸，而我國農村向都市購買洋貨，就是施行銀政策國家所謂「遠東用銀國家的購買力。」在這一種經濟繁榮下，農村固然良好，都市也很良好，商業金融事業也都良好，只不過使國家債務地位日益加重而已。</p>
<p>新幣制後的外匯，一年來是很穩定的。但長期的穩定，必須國際收支順調爲唯一條件，這都是談我國經濟復興的應該加以注意的事。</p>
<p>一年來物價的激劇向上，其中包含着很多的原因，而暴漲暴跌所生的影響，就我國國民經濟立塲説來，不論是生活指數上或原料成本上，前者關及平民生計，後者關係工業的進展，都是極不利的。我們的理想，並不是什麽低物價或高物價政策，而是物價的穩定。</p>
<p>在農民購買力推動以後，造成了經濟的表面繁榮，那倒是以融通商業資金爲職責的金融事業的一條出路。但這並不能引爲樂觀的事。因爲我們當然也希望我國經濟上的獨立，而不是永遠在次殖民地上生長的。照目前的國勢上觀察，并次殖民地的經濟繁榮的維持，根本上恐怕也是一個問題。（十二月廿二日）</p>

<h3>吉林的烏拉</h3>
<p>— 吳江</p>
<p>寒冬的天氣，白天，因爲身體運動的關係，並不覺得冷的可怕，惟有静坐在深夜裏，一雙脚凍得使你坐立不安，於是我不期然而然地想起那「烏拉」的好處來。</p>
<p>怎麽呌烏拉？烏拉，是一種用烏拉草製成的鞋，適宜於冬季穿着。</p>
<p>説到烏拉草，那是吉林的特産，當地有句俗諺説：吉林三寳，人參貂皮，烏拉草。這草，生於各處山野間，莖高三四尺，莖狀如三角形，頂端尖鋭，無花葉，具有叢錯的根鬚，每年春間，由根發生新芽成長。</p>
<p>每屆冰天雪地的冬季時，一般農人，在飯後茶餘的晚間，就忙着製備他們的烏拉了。製造的方法是：先將草椎得很細軟的，然後盛在烏拉皮鞋內，即可穿著。但也有把草先編成小辮，織成一雙鞋，爲了美觀和暖度的保持，並在鞋口鑲以碎毛皮，穿起來，既温暖，又輕便，是再好没有的。在各縣鄉鎭，都有專製的商店，即吉林城市上，也是不缺乏的，而且價格很賤，二三十吊錢（約四五毛錢）就可買一雙，穿這玩意的是很普遍呀。</p>
<p>現在凍瘡上市了，我很想有這麽一雙，但從何處獲得呢？爲着這小東西，又聯帶地感到失地的痛苦。那一天才得「還我山河？」</p>
<h3>向人堆裏鑽的一羣</h3>
<p>— 焦士潔</p>
<p>在上海生活着的人，因着各人生活方式的不同，有些是可以舒服地淸静地生活着，有些則廹於環境，終日在人叢裏生活着。雖然即使是厭煩鬧，怕擠軋但還得向人叢裏去鑽，這到底是那些樣的人呢</p>
<p>第一種是電車上公共汽車上的賣票員，雖然車廂裏用白漆的字明明地寫着此車限乘××客，但誰在數着人數呢？只要車子上能有站立一個人的地位，就可以走上一個人來塡滿這一小處的地位，有時簡直擠得轉不過身來，這是常見的事，不足爲奇。這時，我惟有佩服這一班賣票人的本領了，他們能嘴裏不斷的説着「對不起，而一路的挨進去，居然自裏到外，能一一經他們賣過票，所以我説他們是見了人擠反向人堆裏去，鑽的一種人了</p>
<p>第二種人要算是遊戲塲裏賣東西的了。他們托了一個盤，盤裏盛着些什麽香蕉，荸薺，豆腐干，瓜子等，形形色色，不管塲子裏如何擠，他們總得插進一份身子去，像遊魚似的不住的鑽來鑽去，即使生意没有，即使人家都厭惡，但他們一切，不顧的還是要這樣地進進出出，這也是我所佩服的一等人。</p>
<p>第三種人是遊戲塲裏的一般妓女了。伊們都是濃裝艷抹，像穿梭似的蝴蝶兒倐東倐西，飄忽不定，不住在許多人眼前耀眩，耀眩得人眼花撩亂，心旌摇摇了，於是伊們的大功告成這一班可算是第三種人。</p>
<p>第四種人就是一班白相人，好事者流，譬如馬路上一羣人在圍着看什麽打架等事情，他就必須的要排開了衆人，走將進去，放出老大哥的神氣來，打聽這事情的始末，由他出頭來排解，他就可以從中敲些竹槓，撈些油水。所以這班人，就幾乎無事要生事，既出了事情，還有不擠進身去的道理？此之所謂第四種的人。</p>
<p>以上這四種人，都是向人堆裏鑽的一羣，他們都生活在這繁華的上海，同旁的人一樣。而且我們時常會碰到這一般人的。</p>
<h3>衣橱脱險記（上）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>法國母女的俠行</p>
<p>一九一四年八月，歐洲大戰發作後，在將近八月底時，英軍和德軍大戰於勒加陀。戰罷，有曾在第十一胡薩斯聯隊服務二十一年的騎兵福勒氏和主軍相失，他當前的難題，是怎麽能不被敵人瞥見，和怎麽能覔得食物充飢呢。他如野獸一般，藏在深林中，偶爾遇到慈善的法國鄉農給他些食物，那狼狽的情狀，真非筆墨所能形容。這樣過了數月，到次年一月十五日，他才在倍爾特里村附近深林中遇到一位救星。這人名巴斯康，因爲身體殘廢，不勝軍役，以伐木爲生。那天巴氏正在林中伐木，見了這似人非人，似鬼非鬼的英兵，不勝哀憐，便把隨身所帶的麵包和牛酪分了些給他。於是又指一個幹草堆，叫福勒氏躱在裏面。兩人因言語不通，巴斯康氏費了許多心思，才使福勒氏明白天黑後再來救他。</p>
<p>這位忠實的伐木者，果然踐約，那夜回到原處，把福勒氏領到倍爾特里村家裏。須知這一舉非常危險，縱使巴斯康氏獨個兒行走，已違犯了德軍禁止夜行的軍令，何况還帶領着一個英兵。倘使發覺，難免要處死刑。兩人剛要入村，黑暗中忽走來德國警察兩名，大呼問巴斯康氏爲什麽這時還在外面亂跑？巴氏回答道：「我的丈母生病，叫我去看她。」警察又問：「同行的是誰」？「拿住址姓名證來看！」哎喲！這便糟了。巴斯康氏一片好心，圖救福勒氏，不想才一下手，便遇到死神。正在千鈞一髮的當兒，忽然街頭大起鬧聲，接着，手槍砰砰之聲，像連一般。於是這兩個警察便不顧巴斯康氏和他的同伴，奔往街頭，查視更嚴重的案件，巴斯康氏便乘機帶領福勒氏一溜烟奔回家中。</p>
<h3>地已海裏一矮人島</h3>
<p>— 陳效坎</p>
<p>是世界唯一的樂團</p>
<p>在地中海的東南隅，（相近法蘭西邊境）有一個面積僅二十方里，人口還不上五千的小島，喚做賴球Key　Largo·——這兒的土人，因爲生的長不滿四尺的原故，所以又可稱它爲矮人島。</p>
<p>矮人島上的氣候，異常的温和，土質也極肥沃。在葱鬱挺秀的森林間，滿目都是參天合抱的樹，在漫山遍野裏，如錦的鮮菓，紅的；黄的；青的；白的纍纍地掛垂在碧綠的樹枝上。紅嘴綠毛的鸚鵡，飛翔空際，成羣結隊的白鷗，在水邊嚼着水藻。圖畫裏的風景，風景裏的圖畫，真是世界唯一的樂團呵！</p>
<p>島上的土人，雖然祇有三尺幾寸長的身軀，可是生的十分結實，一年四季是很少有病患發生的。——男男女女都喜歡游泳和爬樹這兩項玩藝兒，在絢爛的晨曦中，在蒼茫的夕暉下，年青的情侣們，對對地手挈着手兒在山巔水涯盡情的玩着，同時嘴裏唱着『P+夕』帶着日本音調的情歌。在這毫無拘束的戲嬉下，一輩熱情的女郎們，就會及時地做下許多浪漫的豔蹟來。</p>
<p>這兒的土人，有着固守的傳統迷信，對於山；川；水；火等有害於它們的事物，便認爲有神明在主宰着，尤以火神與水神每遇到甚麽地方的火山噴發了；或者是水堤潰决了，它們遂毫不懷疑地認作這是由於神的供養不週而震怒的結果，便得設法祭祀和祈禱，而頂大的祭品，就是處女的一條寳貴的生命和美麗的鮮血，這樣，在神的苛毒的要求下，那邨莊上所有的一個最艷麗的少女，就要給大衆擄去脱的一絲不掛地去獻祭神明。在烈燄飛騰的噴火口；在洶湧滔天的狂濤裏，聽着一聲最悽厲的呼號，一條聖處女的寳貴的生命，跟着就完結了。</p>
<p>土人房屋的構造，也很特别，既不用甎牆土壁，又没有觕梁和大柱，四面都是用木板蓋造的，板上開窗，窗框上一點都不加裝飾，夜間大便小遺，也任意撒在家裏，全不知道『衛生』這兩個字的意義。</p>
<p>矮人現在雖然盛行着天主教，然而古代民族的異端迷信，也還有很多的遺留着，在森莽叢林裏，時時發現塑着狠猙獰的偶像和十字架排在一起，同樣地被香火薰的黄黄。——在各個鄉鎭上至今還有定期舉行着的跳舞節，這種跳舞保持着古代民族遺傳下來的風俗。當跳舞的時分披上一條用草編成的裙兒；上身穿着一件形式奇特的古裝，舞姿蹁躚，歌聲婉轉，聽了也很能令人神往呢。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回（素帕寄纒綿奇文鑄錯黄花對憔悴秋信添愁）</p>
<p>國器道：你爲什麽不引他到老太太屋裏去呢。劉媽道：老太太到巷子口上王家去了。我説要去請老太太回來，他又連説不必。我想家裏人全跑了，把客一個人丢在家裏，那太不知道禮節，所以我只好在堂屋裏坐着相陪。國器道：他坐在這屋子裏，同你説了什麽？劉媽道；他没有説什麽？國器道：他翻過我的書嗎？劉媽道：他也没有看書。國器道：難道説，他就呆呆的坐在這屋子裏嗎？劉媽道：是的，他就是呆呆的坐在屋子裏。後來他不知道想起了一樁什麽心事，自己説了一聲，不必等了，就在桌上留下這張字條，向我微微笑着就走了。走到門口，他又回身轉來對我説，不必告訴老太太他來了，免得老太太過意不去。據我看，他總有點事。國器隨手把那紙條，揑成了一個小紙團，便扔在桌子角上字紙簍裏。問道：據你説，他有什麽事呢？劉媽道：這我可不知道。若是我知道，我就對他説破了。國器笑道：當女學生的人，比平常千金小姐不同，他們像男人一樣，無事就可以到外面去拜會朋友的。我們又是親戚，他高興，天天可以來玩，要有什麽事呢？劉媽聽説答應了一聲是。看看先生臉上，還有一點猶預的樣子，自己就退出屋子去了。國器坐在椅子上，出神了一會，後來又想着，此身恰似沾泥絮，這話到底用意何在？想到這裏，把字紙筆裏那張字條重新檢了起來，將字團慢慢的展開，放在桌上，而且用手慢慢的撫摸平整。對了那七個字，很是注意一會，然後把來夾在那本李義山詩集裏，將書歸還了書函，自己背了兩手，在屋子裏踱來踱去，心裏只念着怪事。然而他也不過覺得怪而已，並不因爲友梅這番舉動，移轉了他的視綫。因爲在這日下午，已接到夢蘭一封來信。信上説，那兩顆紅豆，已經收到了。向來在中國詩詞裏面，常看到這種東西的記載，可没有得着這項真東西。現在得了這真的紅豆，足慰數年來的渴想，比瓊瑶之賜，還要珍貴十倍。</p>
<p>特寫</p>
<h3>白猿曬太陽</h3>
<p>— 許恒仁</p>
<p>黄山文殊院，前面有座文殊臺，凹平處不滿五尺。跌坐在那裏：擡頭左右看，左邊就是天都峯頂；右邊就是蓮花峯頂。平遠望去，就是茫茫雲海；奇形怪狀，有許多山頭浮在雲端，儼像海上蓬萊，或存或滅，好看無比。低頭斜看，就是天都峯的山腰裏。</p>
<p>好勝的我，在這天寒地凍的時候，一歩一歩向上走，走到文殊院，天色已經不早了；就在這裏過夜。夜裏的風非常地大！當夜就下雪了。</p>
<p>到了第二天早晨，天又晴了，太陽從山頂一直照到山腰。我就起到文殊臺上坐着，飽我的眼福。忽然間看見天都峯的山腰裏，有一個石洞，許多猿猴從洞口慢慢地爬出來，出來了四十多隻的時候，又有三隻小的扶着一隻大的出來。惟獨這一隻大的毛色是灰白的，其餘的都是青色；映在太陽光綫裏亮晶晶地發光；隨後又爬出青色小的四十多隻來，一共有九十多隻。那隻大的就在洞前凹平處坐下了；前後左右都有小的圍坐着，儼如保衛的模樣。其餘不盡保衛職務的：有幾隻抱更小的哺乳，和人們乳母哺小孩的乳一般。此外有爬在樹上摘女貞子喫的；有在山坡拔草根喫的。還有兩隻從樹上爬下來，爬到白猿跟前，把嘴裏的女貞子吐出來餵它喫；又帮它理鬍鬚—那白鬍鬚已經拖到肚臍了。它的兩顴紅通通地—像塗了胭脂。白猿喫過以後，還要咳嗽—『咳……』—和我們老頭兒咳嗽一樣。又有兩隻在那裏搶喫打架；只見白猿瞧它們一眼，把左邊的前肢一指，咳兩聲嗽—『咳咳』，它倆就不敢再打架了。我正在那裏看的有趣，忽然間太陽被雲遮住了。一班猿猴陸續地，依着出來的次序，先進洞四十多隻，再把白猿扶着進洞，然後完全進洞去了。</p>
<p>我足足看了半天，看完以後，肚裏飢餓，就跑回文殊院裏喫飯。一面喫飯；一面和和尚談天，談到猿猴的把戲，和尚説道：『我們文殊臺下的猿猴，和别處山上的不同，别處山上的毛是黄灰色，文殊臺下的是青色。白色老猿，只有一隻，並無同樣的，也不知有多少年齡了。説起這隻猿來，真神通廣大，不亞昔年的孫悟空。我們山上山下左近一帶所有種的蔬菜瓜果和苞蘆，它的同類從來不去損害。據説這隻老猿—管理它的同類找有規矩的。據我們的老師傅傳説下來：從前逢到有人來山上做齋唸經，等到功德做滿那一天；另外要做些麥粉饝饝給它們喫，叫做齋猴。另外有一篇經典，只要把饝饝放在猿猴洞的左近，叫一個小和尚去唸那篇經典，猿猴就知道爬來，一隻拿一個去，並不多拿一個，有幾十個饝饝，就有幾十隻猿猴來』。我説：『如果做幾百個饝饝，那末就有幾百隻猿猴來了嗎』？和尚説：『我們的老師傅臘裏有數目的，不會呌施主做那多饝饝』。我將信將疑地答應着，一刻兒飯已經喫完了。我就離了文殊院，在那霧氣迷漫裏，一歩一歩走下山去。</p>

<h3>雪夜</h3>
<p>— 聶筠</p>
<p>冬天的日子更短了。黃昏蓋過樹梢的時候，窗外飄著鹅毛羽一般的雪花，打鞦韆一樣在寒風中飛舞，將着近地面，又－陣風捲了起來。放眼向昏黯的天空看去，彷彿從一個遙遠的地方在篩着米紛，漫天價的遊行着。憑着窗欞，想着故鄉該是溜冰的時候了！</p>
<p>就在這落寞的黃昏時候，隔院傳來了鑄鐵的聲音，是他家的姑娘結束了寂寞的－生，還是那些和尚道士在做着無可奈何的鬼把戲？</p>
<p>我拉開了後窗的幔布，天空已是灰黑的一片了。隱約瞧見他們正中的堂屋里明角燈和人影幌動着，猜想那里慌亂的情形正和那位姑娘三歲生辰時同樣熱鬧吧？不過那個做母親的老太太是否也穿着她做親時的錦織裙襖在賓客中間接待，揚着滿面春風的笑臉呢？</p>
<p>那還是去年的事，那位未出閣的姑娘就祇有一回光榮的日子嗎？而現在病倒將近三個月了。每天早上，站在後窗口，看着那些大夫的轎輿穿梭着，那位老太太也拋頭露面親自在迎送呢！猜想她一定在暖閣的觀音像前焚香禱告，虔求她的在天的老伴助佑他的女兒，未亡人現在是只有這一顆掌上珠承歡膝下了。而且她有着這遠的希求，她要為她的女兒覓得一戶相配的乘龍快婿，母女倆個的終身有靠，也要為她老伴的祀祭着想，然而她沒有知道女兒底寶貴的青春消逝了，三十歲的姑娘她是有着她的懷求呢！</p>
<p>光榮的生辰過後，就是三十一度的春天來了。堂屋四周的捲簾都吊了起來，檐前的燕巢又喃呢着黃嘴的乳燕，母燕匆忙地在池畔飛掠着，彷彿和花間的蝴蝶爭妍，但是它負着做母親的責任，掠攫了食物去哺喂它們的兒女，等到秋雁南來的時候，它們像歸家的女兒－樣率領着自己的兒女回到南方的老家呵！</p>
<p>堂屋的樓上，就是姑娘的閨房，那里幾乎終年深垂着湖緞的幔窗。據說他家的老爺，從前放過知縣，官家小姐自然不肯輕易出頭露面的。她們深居在閨闧里，有善侍人意的丫頭陪俸的，下一曲棋，吟幾首詩，即是興緻濃厚的時候，也不過玩着牙牌消遣。下堂樓也要翻過黃曆上的大吉日的。</p>
<p>時間真是無情的魔鬼，武昌城下的一砲聲改變了時代，同時打破了他們美滿的家庭，那所大宅院做了她們是後的住所。但是過去是不能再來了，在惱人的春天里，堂樓上的窗幔也打了開來。院子是荒蕪了，只有墻角里一株梨花綻着三五朶白色的小花，於是女主人摘下掛壁上的月琴，調整了絃索，由尖尖的手指送出雁心底里的煩愁。有時窗前焚着一爐麝香，她注視著翩翩的燕子在那里若有所思，她或許向天禱告：父親在地下平安，母親身體康健，與乎自己的心愿，但是她現在缺少一個伶俐的婢女呢！</p>
<p>那紅樓一角，就永遠銷閉着她的怨愁！在乳燕南歸的秋天，她病倒了，到現在將近三個月了！</p>
<p>雪下得更密了，一團一團的，掌燈時候，屋角上巳經鋪看白色的外衣了。</p>
<p>鐃鈸的聲音敲了個通夜，堂樓的窗外吊着一盞秀巧的紅紗燈，那是故鄉叫魂的記號。看着那盞在狂風中飄忽的燈亮，我彷彿感到故鄉親切的溫情，默默背誦着“地鄉過故知”的詩句，祝福那個沒落的家庭幸福！</p>
<p>將近黎明時候，鐃鈸聲里卹雜着悽切的哭聲，從後窗望去，飄忽在堂樓外面的紅紗燈巳經熄滅了。</p>
<p>雪花更厚地蓋着屋脊，樹頭，鋪道，卻掩不了那位母親的哭聲。</p>
<p>談言</p>
<h3>圍爐取暖談</h3>
<p>— 德隣</p>
<p>圍爐取暖，原是極風雅的事，在取暖之餘，再寫：此圍爐偶記之類的東西，就更顯得悠繳閑了。不過時至今日，暖既不是人人皆得而取之，而且取暖的方法，也不一定要圍爐，因為，火爐之外，還有所謂水汀也者，它其實比圍煙要舒適得多。所以雖則同樣能夠使身體暖和，但方式卻大大的不同。當然，天氣一冷，只要是有生命的動物，是沒有一個不愛暖的，那些不能夠圍爐或住水汀房間的人，就只有自嘆命苦了。</p>
<p>說命苦，寶在也是的：在這樣的冷天，能夠坐在房間里弄個火爐來溫暖溫暖，也不很不容易了，躑躅在街頭，身上沒有棉衣的人，連歆羨怕都來不及，可是假使命苦之後，連坐在屋子里生火，也會闖出大禍來：</p>
<p>“湖南人劉若會，妻周止萍，家住北河南路寶興坊七號亭子間內，前晚天氣較寒，臨睡前，在屋中燃一煤球爐取暖，詎因中毒……當即呼吸短促，不省人事，…………兩人皆己命危云……”</p>
<p>這是前天上海各報的紀載。這新聞的本身就够說明苦命人之所以為苦命的：夫妻同住一個亭子間，照例就沒有資格取暖。雖闖了這樣大的禍，也還是缺乏衛生的常識，如果他倆知道煤氣悶在房間裹是會中毒，他們就不會如此的。可是如果他們能够多花幾個錢，裝上幾節鉛皮的筒子，將煤氣通到外面來，不就够安全嗎？然而他們不知道有這一個妙法，－－其實並不是不知，而是不能，但看他們住亭子間，就可以知道呌匠人來裝鉛皮筒子是“力有未逮了！</p>
<p>在馬路上凍得索索抖的人，對着住在亭子間裹生火的朋友，無疑地是在羨慕，可是他們却不知道這裹面的人也在羨慕住水汀房間的。對於這一對不幸者的生命，我們自然耍致其無限的同情，可是我們倒並不是希望他們也能够去住水汀，而是希望他們增多一點衛生的常識，更甚的，是希望在街頭躑躅的苦命的朋友，也有一天能够住到亭子間來！</p>

<p>開篇花「花月痕」</p>
<p>絶代奇書花月痕。情塲因果話紛紛。秋心院裏人如玉。春鏡樓頭客斷魂。夢到雙鴛心事忤。十年飄泊困風塵。才人落魄尋常事。辜負了昂藏七尺身。莫笑痴珠窮困絶。憐才奇女有秋痕。相逢何必曾相識。都是天涯淪落人。收拾綺緣歸恨地。聊將一死報殊恩。采秋同是倡家女。詩賦文章百事能。體態風流人艷絶。一雙巨眼識書生。從來艷福天生就。一箭雙雕好事成。富貴貧窮何足道。顯榮困頓莫輕論。唐衢涕淚馮唐老。浩氣徒然志不伸。贏得千秋佳話在。及身而後布衣尊。閑來説盡吾心頭悦。不管天沉與地昏。拖琵琶花月淡留痕</p>

<h3>The Situation in Xi'an is Extremely Chaotic</h3>
<p>All Businesses are Shut Down, and the People are Filled with Panic. The Central Government Still Hopes for Awakening from Yang and Yu. Wang Shuchang Remains in Beijing and Has Not Yet Departed.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Great Fire at Xidan Commercial Center in Beiping</h3>
<p>Nearly 900 New and Old Stores Destroyed, Building and Merchandise Losses Total 2.6 Million Yuan, Authorities Investigate Disaster Situation and Prepare Relief Efforts</p>
<p>[Beiping] A major fire broke out at the Xidan Commercial Center in Beiping at 1:40 am on the 10th. The fire spread very quickly, and by around 4:00 am, the entire new and old centers had been burned down. The embers had not completely extinguished as of 7:00 pm this afternoon. The total building loss amounted to 200,000 yuan. The loss of merchandise has not yet been fully reported by the burned-out merchants, and there is no accurate statistic, but it is roughly estimated at 2-3 million yuan. This is unprecedented in Beiping in decades. According to those who escaped from the fire, there was a strong wind last night, and the weather suddenly turned cold. There were few visitors to the commercial center. The merchants closed their doors around 11:00 pm. Suddenly, at 1:40 am, a fire broke out. At that time, the watchmen of the commercial center and the police shouted along the doors. The people in each shop woke up in alarm and fled in confusion. The fire had already spread in all directions, and dense smoke filled the air. Its momentum was extremely fierce and quickly spread throughout the new and old centers. Therefore, the point of origin of the fire has remained unknown. According to mutual rumors among the people in the commercial center, it was approximately (1) the New Guangdong Restaurant, located on the southeast border of the old commercial center and the new commercial center; (2) the Itodani Commercial Residence in the new commercial center; (3) the Wu Ji Western Clothing stall in the old commercial center. The authorities were still detaining and questioning the watchmen of the commercial center as of yesterday. At 2:05 am, Fire Chief Bai Laizeng, upon receiving the report, led the entire fire brigade, teams 1, 2, 3, and 4, to the scene and distributed four fire engines at the four gates of the commercial center, with two fire engines outside the west gate, one in the Tangzi Hutong south of the commercial center, and one at the west end of Taipusi Street behind the commercial center. The team members were deployed to extinguish the fire, but because the fire was discovered a little late, the fire was too fierce, and the extinguishing was ineffective. At exactly 3:00 am, the flames from the northwest of the Yimao store to the southwest of the Wangmao store and behind the Fubinglou all soared into the sky, and it was impossible to approach. Bai Laizeng immediately ordered the firebreaks to be intensified to prevent the fire from spreading. Later, Chen Jiqing, Director of the Public Security Bureau, happened to be at the residence of Mayor Qin Dechun of Beiping. Upon hearing the report, he rushed to the scene, together with Inspector Qian Zongchao, Director Zhu Yuezhi of the Third District, and Captain Han Xiuting of the Third Security Team, to supervise the police and security teams in setting up posts and guarding the fire site. A company of infantry from the 29th Army stationed at the 物檀 Temple also arrived to set up posts. Traffic was cut off from Xidan Archway to Ganshiqiao. At that time, the north wind had not stopped, and the fire took advantage of the wind to surge into the clouds. The electric light company temporarily stopped the current north of Xidan, and the electric lights were completely dimmed, but the fire was still shining brightly. The streets and alleys around the commercial center were all covered in a deep red glow. The situation was tragic. The embers flew south with the wind, like stars in the sky, falling everywhere. Merchants and residents near the commercial center rushed to salvage their belongings, and the situation was tense and chaotic. Because the fire hose of the fire brigade leaked water in many places, shooting water was extremely difficult. Xidan North Street was full of water leaks. The residence of former Prime Minister Wang Shiling in front of Tangzi Hutong and the back of the Yijiao Girls' Middle School, adjacent to the commercial center, were in a dangerous situation due to the chaotic falling of embers. After the fire brigade watered them in advance and demolished the back of Wang's residence, they were finally preserved. Merchants and residents who escaped from the commercial center and its vicinity temporarily took refuge in Tangzi Hutong. The fire gradually died down at 4:00 am. The telegraph pole in front of the West Bureau of Telephones across from Yimao Store was baked by the fire. After being extinguished, it was spared demolition. The fire scene was mostly extinguished by 6:00 am this morning. The military police stationed there slightly withdrew, and the fire brigade continued to extinguish the embers, which had not been extinguished all day. As of 7:00 pm this afternoon, smoke was still emitting continuously. The trolley cars north of Xidan were all stopped, and the ground was covered with swimming pools. Lei Sishang, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, made a special visit to inspect at around 8:00 am this morning. He will investigate the losses with the Public Security Bureau and prepare appropriate relief measures. Because the fire was too intense at the time of the outbreak, the authorities thought that some merchants in the venue might have been in distress. Because the investigation takes time, no accurate number has been found yet. According to the investigation by the Public Security Bureau, the accurate number of losses in this fire is as follows: The new commercial center burned a total of 470 rooms, with a construction cost of 400,000 yuan. The venue was built by Rongyi Company, owned by Wan Fulin, commander of the 53rd Army. After the venue was damaged, Wan was telegraphed. Because the venue had fire insurance of 150,000 yuan with Yongdian Company in Tianjin, the company has been reported and asked to investigate the credit. Investigators can be sent to Ping tomorrow. The venue has 54 merchants and 140 stalls. The amount of lost goods is being registered by the Second District by notifying the affected merchants, because the shopkeepers and stall owners fled after the fire. The old commercial center burned a total of 400 rooms, with a construction cost of 200,000 yuan. The venue was built by the owner of the New Guangdong Restaurant, and it has a basic property fire insurance of 100,000 yuan with a certain insurance company, and is also contacting the company to request compensation. The venue has a total of 200 shops, 60 merchants, and 150 stalls. The amount of lost goods is also being registered by the Second District. In the midst of the chaotic situation, an apprentice from Yimao Store went missing. Wang Yulin, the shopkeeper of Qianfu Leather Shoes Store, who was about 30 years old and from Tianjin, was burned on his face, head, back, and limbs because he was slow to escape. He was rescued by the police and sent to the Municipal Hospital for treatment. His injuries are quite serious. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] This morning, a fire broke out in the large market in Beiping's West City, with losses amounting to 1 million yuan. The market is one of the main commercial markets in Beiping, with various shops occupying an area of approximately 30,000 square feet. It is said that around 2:00 am this morning, the watchman of the market discovered the fire. The fire brigade quickly arrived at the scene to extinguish the fire, but because the wind was too strong, it spread very quickly. As a result, approximately 200 shops were destroyed. As of this evening, the fire had not been completely extinguished. As for whether there were any casualties, it is currently unknown. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] A fire broke out in the middle street of the Xidan Commercial Center in Beiping at around 2:00 am on the 10th. Because a north wind was raging, it quickly spread throughout the venue. The fire brigade was dispatched upon hearing the news, and the authorities sent military police to the scene to maintain order. It was not extinguished until 6:00 am, but the venue, which was known as Beiping's second-largest commercial center, had become a wasteland. When the fire broke out, all the shop assistants in the shopping mall were awakened from their dreams. They rushed out without even putting on clothes, causing cries to be heard everywhere on Xidan Street, which was extremely miserable. In order to maintain order, the authorities temporarily cut off traffic in the area around the commercial center, which gradually resumed at noon. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined, and the number of casualties is also difficult to know. It is estimated that more than 500 large and small shops were burned, and the loss of all the real estate is approximately 2 million yuan. The loss of goods is even greater. The authorities are currently investigating the true cause of the fire, and because this fire was too great and the market is sluggish, it will be difficult to restore it to its original state in the short term. Therefore, they plan to provide special relief to maintain commercial difficulties regarding the aftermath. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Britain and Fascist Countries㊂</h3>
<p>— British Member of Parliament Strabolgi Translated by Jin Tunan</p>
<p>Regarding the difficult question of returning German colonies, especially in Africa, we do not believe that there are no secret understandings. This summer, the Minister of Defense of the United Nations of South Africa, Mr. Pirow, was hired in London. After returning to South Africa, he publicly stated that important figures in Britain told him that British policy would support Germany's demands for territory in Africa. Mr. Pirow's statement obviously changed a claim.</p>
<p>Sir Vansittart, one of the most important figures in London, is the leader of the permanent officials of the Foreign Office. His wife and Mrs. Phipps (wife of the British Ambassador to Germany) are sisters. Mr. Vansittart has always been pro-French, until this summer.</p>
<p>Between July and August this year, he went to Berlin publicly in a private capacity and stood next to Hitler to watch the World Games. He and various official and unofficial German diplomats, such as Führer Hitler, Ribbentrop, and Neurath, did not discuss sports issues, and his purpose was to approach these important diplomats. We must note that since Mr. Pirow's visit to London, the sanctions policy against Italy has been lifted. Since Mr. Vansittart arrived in Ganlin, Germany's emphasis on recovering its former colonies or ceding territories of a tropical and semi-tropical colonial nature has also changed.</p>
<p>In this way, the turmoil of having colonies has been ceded to the idea of a perfect solution to this matter.</p>
<p>Within the British Conservative Party, there are still some powerful figures who, regardless of Germany or other countries' political system, fiercely oppose using British territory to satisfy the needs of Germany or other countries. You are unwilling to abandon even an inch or foot of colonial protectorate mandate territory. These people are ardent imperialists, awakened by the late Joseph Chamberlain.</p>
<p>The sponsors of this Birmingham policy now include Austen Chamberlain (the half-brother of Finance Minister Chamberlain) and former Cabinet Minister Amery. Both of them are representatives of Birmingham in the British Parliament.</p>
<p>Before the long parliamentary recess reopened, the House of Commons openly launched a fierce attack on the cabinet, demanding confirmation that the government's foreign negotiations did not include the issue of British territory, and demanding an explanation that the government did not discuss this issue. All parties were dissatisfied with this powerful part of the main British party. Regardless of how the general leaders of the British government put it, they always believed that there had been a gentleman's agreement on the colonial issue.</p>
<p>Now let us look at the recent events in Spain again. According to international law, the status of this chaotic area is very clear. Regardless of its merits or demerits, or the complexity of the situation, there is only one Spanish government recognized internationally. It has diplomatic representatives in countries around the world. It requests and repays a special kind of assistance in the diplomatic relations of friendly countries, which is obviously an obligation that all countries should fulfill. There will be no question of neutrality. As for imposing an arms embargo, that is an unfriendly act.</p>
<p>Furthermore, providing arms, money, and other assistance to the rebels to oppose the Spanish government recognized by all countries is clearly an act of aggression. The governments of Italy and Germany have committed this act of aggression before and after the outbreak of the rebellion. The British government's initial attitude was correct. The Spanish Navy transported arms and the like to the Strait of Gibraltar in the name of the government, and was not actually hindered, although this investigation was not easy. The government's tendency is to observe so-called strict neutrality between the two conflicting groups; however, this is not allowed to be distinguished between the recognized government and the rebels.</p>
<p>The French government and the majority of the French Parliament wanted to directly help the Spanish government, which was a completely legal action; however, French Prime Minister Lebrun hesitated, partly because he hoped for a universal agreement not to supply arms to either side, and partly because he doubted Britain's attitude.</p>
<p>This delay has benefited the rebels' pseudo-helpers. However, as mentioned above, if fascist Spain unites with the fascist group in Europe, it will pose a major danger to the British Empire. The British government's cold attitude towards France and its lack of goodwill towards the Spanish government are difficult to explain unless it is assumed that British politics are considering changes. If Britain does not want to join the fascist group, then the victory of the Spanish rebels will cause Britain to suffer many dangers.</p>
<p>After occupying East Africa, Italy has many things to be done, and Germany has not yet fully completed its rearmament. It is not easy to imagine that they would suddenly take the dangerous measure of assisting the Spanish rebels without first measuring Britain's attitude.</p>
<p>In fact, this action violates Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant, which is clearly an act of aggression. We have not forgotten the difficulties that Britain suffered during the American Civil War.</p>
<p>Therefore, if the Spanish government can win victory, in theory, we can use the entire League of Nations mechanism to demand compensation for damages, enforce the payment of damages, or other compensation through sanctions or other methods. In short, this action by Germany and Italy cannot be deeply believed by observers familiar with the current situation without some secret understanding from Britain, or at least an understanding with a part of the British government that controls the final policy.</p>
<p>If Baldwin, MacDonald, and Chamberlain, this gang, maintain their power in the British cabinet, a secret agreement between Britain and Germany will be completed immediately.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, Britain really no longer needs to boast of being a bridge between Germany and France. Things will inevitably have new changes soon, and it is not easy for us to predict its final outcome now.</p>

<h3>Japan Strengthens Foreign Exchange Control</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, the Japanese Ministry of Finance issued an order to strengthen foreign exchange management. The main point is to strictly control the buying and selling of foreign exchange and restrict the payment of import prices. This extraordinary measure can be said to be an inevitable result of the current stage of the Japanese economic crisis.</p>
<p>Since Japan has stepped up the implementation of its so-called "active policy," it has fallen into a very precarious situation internally. In particular, the emptiness of funds is the biggest blow to the economy and finance. Because the military industry has deprived general production enterprises, making normal reproduction impossible to promote, and all useful funds have been almost entirely consumed on unproductive military preparations. At the same time, the excess of imports over exports has increased dramatically, and cash has continued to flow out, further shaking the foundation of the financial market. According to statistics, the excess of imports over exports in the previous year was 14.758 million yuan, and last year it reached 130.175 million yuan, an increase of tenfold. The gold paid abroad last year reached a huge 250 million yuan. This is definitely not something that poor Japan can sustain. In order to continue to strengthen its so-called "national defense" and implement its so-called "quasi-wartime system," it is absolutely necessary to preserve cash. The recent announcement of the huge budget for Showa 11 concretely reflects Japan's urgent need for funds.</p>
<p>The basic function of the newly issued order to strengthen exchange management is to control the inflow and outflow of funds. The Ministry of Finance's main intention is to reduce the outflow of funds by restricting foreign exchange payments. At the same time, it also wants to reduce the import of general commodities by restricting imports and focus on importing military supplies and military raw materials in trade, in order to carry out its consistent policy of military expansion. However, we cannot be optimistic for the Japanese authorities. The aforementioned laws obviously have many contradictions. First, to reduce the excess of imports over exports or eliminate the excess of imports over exports and turn to an excess of exports over imports, in addition to restricting imports, it is also necessary to increase exports. However, the current world market does not allow Japan to move freely. It is said that among the 127 countries that have trade relations with Japan, as many as 74 countries are boycotting Japanese goods. It can be seen that the future of Japan's export trade is over. Second, Japan is extremely lacking in raw material production. Since the military industry is expanding endlessly, the import of raw materials will naturally also increase endlessly. If this situation does not change, Japan will eventually become like Germany at present, exhausting its foreign exchange funds.</p>
<p>Naturally, the final means can also be to adopt direct currency inflation. But this means will instead promote the accelerated collapse of the Japanese economy. It can be asserted. Domestically, currency inflation will only make the people more impoverished and strengthen the revolutionary factors. At the very least, it will reduce the people's ability to bear taxes and absorb public bonds, making tax policies and public bond policies more bankrupt. As far as foreign countries are concerned, the method of exchange dumping may no longer be as profitable as in the past. How can the fragile Japanese yen withstand a blow from the joint front of British, American, and French currencies?</p>
<p>In short, the Japanese economy has reached its most critical stage. Strengthening exchange management can at most alleviate the economic crisis for a while. Looking at the chaotic situation of the Japanese exchange rate in the past day or two, where even no one cared about it, the currency inflation in the future may still be difficult to avoid.</p>
<p>Here, let us imagine our own situation again. We cannot forget that China is the most direct target under the "active policy." Economically speaking, the goods that Japan encounters obstacles elsewhere will surely flood into China like a flood. At the same time, China's raw materials will also be massively loaded away by Japan. In this situation, can we not actively plan for self-defense?</p>
<h3>Berlin Denies German Troops Opening Morocco</h3>
<p>Still Cannot Eliminate French Fear, Curb Foreign Intervention in West Inner Strife, Britain Prepares to Take Concrete Action</p>
<p>[Paris] Today, responsible circles in France said that the continuous influx of Germans into Spanish Moroccan territory has caused a very serious situation. Berlin's denial of the existence of German troops in Morocco has increased public anxiety. According to a concrete statement here, the German presence in Morocco is a serious threat to France's defense deployment, because this deployment is based on unimpeded transportation in North Africa and is completely unrelated to the Spanish Civil War. The French government is now closely discussing this matter with the British government, which is a great comfort to the French government. It is heard that the British government has decided to take concrete action at the end of this month to curb foreign intervention in the Spanish Civil War. Even if it cannot be completely stopped, it intends to seek to prevent it from worsening. It is rumored that British Foreign Secretary Eden is currently planning to convene a six-nation conference in order to reach a compromise on reversing the danger of foreign intervention in the Spanish Civil War. There is no way to confirm this statement yet. However, it is generally believed that senior commanders from Britain and France may hold military talks. At the same time, according to an article published by the German News Agency, the German government has made its first official denial of the stationing of German troops in Spain or Spanish Morocco. It is said that because various foreign newspapers have spread various news of German troops entering Spanish Morocco, the News Agency has been specially instructed to declare that no German troops have arrived in Spain or Spanish Morocco. Berlin political circles claim that this news is continued by someone to poison international relations and is the product of the oversensitive. When the German denial was announced, the German government's press released an editorial with changing foreign communications, which was contrary to what was previously said about the Spanish Incident being the result of the work of the International Bolshevik Party. Today, the newspaper mentioned the incident as a civil war and said that the only way to end the Spanish tragedy is to return to the natural starting point, which is to recognize that the war in Spain is a purely internal affair of the Spanish people.

<h3>French Government Negotiates with the West</h3>
<p>Based on the Morocco Treaty, Please Pay Attention to German Military Activities</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the issue of German activities in Spanish Morocco, it is rumored that the French government has made representations to the Western National Military government. According to responsible sources, this is not the case. However, French Resident General in Morocco, General Noguès, has instructed the French Consul in Tetouan (the capital of Spanish Morocco) to make representations to the Spanish High Commissioner in Morocco based on the 1904 and 1912 Franco-Spanish treaties, instructing him to pay attention to the stationing of German troops in Spanish Morocco, which violates the provisions of these treaties. This representation will be made this afternoon or tomorrow. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Forces Invade Northern Africa, France Issues Strong Warning</h3>
<p>Naval Exercises to be Conducted in the Mediterranean; Close Military Cooperation Between Britain and France</p>
<p>[Paris] France has warned Germany that if it sends more troops to Spanish Morocco, France may also have to consider military action. A foreign ministry spokesperson told an Associated Press reporter today that France currently has no special military operations in Morocco, but may consider them if Germany increases its troops. The spokesperson also said that (London has been consulted, hoping to change the policy of Italian and German intervention in Spanish affairs. In the naval ports of Brest and Toulon, 74 warships are preparing for secret exercises in the Mediterranean. Government officials still insist that these exercises are routine and not intended to intimidate Germany. However, according to London sources, France has suggested to Britain that they conduct joint naval demonstrations in Spanish Morocco, but Britain has rejected this proposal, saying that the government does not yet believe the situation has become serious enough to warrant demonstrations. The departure date and route of the French warships are currently being kept secret, but it is understood that the 38 ships of the Atlantic Fleet will exercise off the coast of Casablanca and Agadir, while the six ships of the Toulon Fleet will exercise near Corsica, off the French coast. It is reported that General Noguès, the French resident-general in Morocco, will arrive here on the 15th of this month to discuss "all matters concerning Morocco," and that Defense Minister Daladier will lead staff members to Morocco within a week to inspect defenses. Daladier's trip is a direct result of Germany's troop deployments. At the same time, Navy Minister Darlan will also inspect naval ports near "dangerous locations" in Morocco. Officials deny reports that France has sent 100,000 troops to North Africa, saying that France currently has no intention of intervening militarily in Spanish Morocco and will not allow the situation there to develop to any extent for which it is responsible. One report says that the French Atlantic Fleet, currently cruising in the South Atlantic, may change its route to the Mediterranean, leading some to believe that France may insist on a joint Anglo-French naval blockade of the Spanish coast in order to enforce the neutrality agreement. A government spokesman further stated that France will not allow Germany to establish military bases in Morocco. Recently, many Germans have immigrated to French territory in North Africa. Ordinarily, Germans cannot transfer capital abroad, but in North Africa, they can buy property, and the number of Germans enlisting in the French Foreign Legion has also increased sharply, so the foreign ministry is very concerned that a conflict could lead to serious problems. However, the head of the foreign intelligence department, Mr. Guo Mei, still calls the rumors that France is prepared to take military action against Germany in Morocco unfounded.

<p>[London] French Ambassador Corbin called on Foreign Secretary Eden in the afternoon to exchange views on the replies submitted by Germany and Italy, in order to maintain close contact between Britain and France on the issue of banning volunteers from going to Spain. In addition, Eden and Corbin also discussed the issue of German activities in Spanish Morocco. As a result, it is possible that the naval vessels of Britain and France stationed in Moroccan waters may cooperate in some way. According to recent news from Morocco, another batch of German troops will soon arrive in Spanish Morocco, where barracks have been prepared to house them. This news is quite disturbing. The British and French governments are now exchanging information, and any suspicious actions in Morocco will be reported by the naval vessels of both countries stationed in Moroccan waters to their respective navies via wireless radio, and the two governments will notify each other. As for the rumors that the two governments have ordered their warships to take coercive action in Moroccan waters, both countries here deny them. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Casablanca: Although news is strictly censored in Spanish Morocco, it has been learned here today that there are indeed 300 German soldiers in Manlila, and a smaller team of German soldiers in Boar Aiten near Gouda. The German cruiser "Spee" is stationed near Tangier. General Noguès, the French resident-general in Morocco, told an Associated Press reporter that France is prepared to deal with any unexpected event and can defend its treaty rights in Morocco without firing a single shot.

<h3>British Government Issues Second Note</h3>
<p>Addressed to Italy, Germany, and Three Other Countries, Urging Non-Intervention in Spain</p>
<p>[London] News today that Britain will send notes to Italy, Germany, Russia, and Portugal tomorrow, requesting a ban on the further dispatch of volunteers to Spain. It is understood that the note will suggest setting a date this month and using international controls to ban volunteers from entering Spain. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] It has been learned that the British government will send notes to Germany, Italy, France, Russia, and Portugal tomorrow, with four objectives: ㊀ To confirm that each country has accepted in principle the ban on volunteers going to Spain; ㊁ To inquire when and how each country can implement the ban; ㊂ To notify each country of the measures that Britain itself will take. On this point, the British government will promulgate the "Foreign Enlistment Act" next week, prohibiting people from volunteering to serve in Spain, with violators subject to imprisonment; ㊃ Regarding the monitoring of indirect intervention (such as the dispatch of volunteers), Britain does not intend to propose any other plans in response to the demands of Germany and Italy, but only to express that Britain is prepared to accept all the suggestions of the London Adjustment Committee. Observers generally hope that after Britain takes the lead in expressing sincerity and fairness to set an example regarding the issue of banning volunteers, the countries concerned, especially Germany and Italy, can quickly adopt legislative procedures to follow suit. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] The "Sunday Referee" reported today that it "learned" that Prime Minister Baldwin suggested that if the interference of various countries in the Spanish Civil War cannot be stopped immediately, the Navy Department should draft a plan to blockade the entire coast of Spain, and the Cabinet has approved the Prime Minister's suggestion. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>[London] Cabinet members held meetings on Saturday and diplomats visited each other frequently. It is widely believed that this is due to the British authorities' awareness of the increasing potential for international disputes in Spain, leading to new suggestions to prevent trouble. Diplomatic visitors now expect Lord Plymouth, chairman of the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War, to propose a new plan at the committee's meeting on Wednesday, abandoning the current monitoring system and replacing it with a detailed plan including provisions for dealing with air transport and volunteers. Newspapers in France and Germany have been attacking each other for days about rumors of German activities in Spanish Morocco, creating a sharp atmosphere. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Attack German Military Actions</h3>
<p>Claiming They Will Lead to Serious Consequences; German Newspapers Denounce Them as Deliberate Slander</p>
<p>[Paris] Newspapers continue to comment on the landing of German troops in Spanish Morocco. Le Petit Parisien wrote, "The troops stationed in the French territories of Algeria and Morocco in North Africa can be mobilized at any time, and the British fleet stationed in the Strait of Gibraltar has not been transferred elsewhere. If Germany's dangerous actions continue without restraint, the country will encounter a strong resistance." Le Journal wrote, "What we value is maintaining the status quo in the Mediterranean. Italy has already established a Mediterranean agreement with Britain, so why should it be otherwise? The relationship between Britain and France has now reached completion, as can be seen from the fact that the naval departments of each country have begun to exchange information." L'Écho de Paris wrote that the French Consul General in Tetouan, the capital of Spanish Morocco, issued a warning and protest to the Spanish Moroccan High Commissioner this morning. The significance of this move is very clear: France has the power to make people respect its rights, and Britain has supported it. If we continue to shirk responsibility at this time, it will inevitably lead to serious consequences." Madame Tabouis, a famous reporter for L'Œuvre, declared, "The continued encroachment of German labor into Spanish Rio de Oro in North Africa is obvious. This place was originally a haven for fugitives. All the leaders of bandits and rebels who have not yet surrendered and those who are hostile to French colonial policy have hidden here. The Germans love to go there to organize, arm, and train them, and help them build defenses, so that in the event of an incident, they can cut off the connection between French Morocco and French West Africa. In addition, Germans are actively operating in Portuguese islands off the coast of West Africa, such as Cape Verde, Funchal, and Madeira, and establishing oil depots to store heavy oil and gasoline. It is said that a batch of German engineers and technicians will soon go to the Spanish Canary Islands to work." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Newspapers are strongly attacking the news reported by French newspapers about the German army's deployment to Spanish Morocco in North Africa, apparently at the instigation of the authorities. The Volksbeobachter wrote, "It is said that Germany has a planned uprising in Spanish Morocco in order to offset the soothing psychology of world opinion. French journalists who are familiar with the country's foreign ministry have actually fabricated this clumsy news. What about their vaunted French wisdom?" The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung wrote, "Trying to attribute all responsibility to Germany is a childish act." The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung wrote, "The reason why France is stirring up anti-German sentiment is that the replies submitted by the German and Italian governments on the issue of banning volunteers from serving in Spain have made a strong impression on fair-minded people in France. In order to shift this impression, French newspapers have fabricated false news to slander Germany." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Internal Disagreements in Germany on the Spanish Question</h3>
<p>Army Commander-in-Chief Advocates Caution, Even Willing to Resign to Advocate His Position</p>
<p>[London] According to reports from Berlin correspondents of Parisian newspapers, Hitler currently has serious disagreements with the army and navy authorities on the Spanish question. It is said that Defense Minister General von Blomberg and Army Commander-in-Chief General von Fritsch, among others, are greatly displeased with Hitler for opposing the plan to assist General Franco, the leader of the Spanish Nationalist forces. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Führer Hitler is spending his vacation in Berchtesgaden and is scheduled to return to Berlin this Sunday. Previously, it was generally speculated that during Hitler's absence from the capital, the German government would temporarily "ceasefire" in diplomatic terms, but observers generally believe that this speculation is incorrect. In the first few days of the new year, the German cruiser "Königsberg" was very active in Spanish waters, and at the end of last year, General Faupel, the German Chargé d'Affaires in Burgos, Spain, returned to Germany to meet with Hitler in Berchtesgaden and personally told him that if he wanted to capture Madrid, Germany would have to send an expeditionary force of 60,000 troops to join the Nationalist forces. Later, rumors suddenly spread that General von Fritsch, the Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, had resigned. It was said that General von Fritsch believed that the German army's activities in Spain would inevitably lead to war, which would be a mistake for the country and the German army, so he was willing to resign to advocate his position. At the same time, people in upper-class society revealed the opinions of senior military authorities, believing that "Germany currently lacks food, and if it launches a war at this time, it will inevitably have to implement a food rationing system. If so, the war will inevitably fail." Later, military circles predicted that Führer Hitler would allow Fritsch to resign and replace him with General Reichenau, but in the end, Hitler accepted the advice of military advisors and allowed more flexibility, and did not send an expeditionary force to Spain to assist in the war, but only sent members of the National Socialist Party's paramilitary Schutzstaffel and special forces, carrying military supplies, to Spain. As for the German government's attitude towards Spain in the future, it will depend on the following two situations: ㊀ What is the response of various countries to the German government's reply on January 7 (regarding the issue of banning volunteers)? ㊁ Can the Nationalist forces capture Madrid, as Germany hopes? (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Spanish Rebel Forces Continue Fierce Assault on the Capital</h3>
<p>Adopting a Concentrated Tactics; Heavy Losses; Garrison Resists Calmly Without Dispiritedness</p>
<p>Madrid: The Nationalist forces launched a fierce attack on the capital yesterday and today, but the offensive has weakened somewhat due to the government forces' desperate resistance. The Nationalist forces are adopting a concentrated offensive tactic, and their losses have been quite heavy. Overall, the Nationalist forces are quite familiar with modern warfare methods, and the equipment they use is the latest type. For example, when the Nationalist aircraft bomb at night, they often launch rockets to observe the ground conditions before dropping bombs. Also, before the rebel artillery bombarded this afternoon, the planes first dropped smoke bombs on the target to aid in aiming. Instances like this are too numerous to list. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Special dispatch from our reporter: Although fierce fighting has taken place in the suburbs of Madrid in the past week, the government forces have resisted calmly and have not been dispirited. The strategy adopted by the Nationalist forces is to feign a retreat to lure the enemy forward in an attempt to win a quick victory, but the government forces have carefully observed and have not penetrated deeply. All positions that could not be defended in time were abandoned. The places recaptured by the Nationalist forces last Sunday were these kinds of places. As for the government's militia in the area of Aravaca in the northwest suburbs, they fought extremely fiercely and even broke through the Nationalist trenches, which was very successful. At present, the road from Madrid to the city of El Escorial has indeed been cut off, but the roads elsewhere can still be used normally, so the garrison in the Guadarrama Mountains north of the capital can still receive a steady supply of food, and there is no need to worry about shortages. Based on this, it would be premature to say that Madrid has now turned the corner and is safe, but it can be said that the garrison in the capital now has room to breathe, and the future of the war is more promising. (Reuter, 10th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Special dispatch from our reporter: The government forces fought fiercely in the Casa de Campo park in the western suburbs of Madrid, and the number of those killed in battle reached more than 300. By the afternoon, the fighting was even more intense, and the sound of machine guns never stopped all day until sunset. However, no government planes were seen in the skies over the Nationalist positions. On the contrary, 30 planes belonging to the Nationalist forces flew back and forth over Madrid for a long time. It is generally believed that the city of El Escorial northwest of Madrid will fall sooner or later, and the garrison there can only control a few small roads, so it is not easy to evacuate the stockpiled ammunition to the rear.

<h3>Horse Meat Fills Bellies in Besieged City</h3>
<p>Santander: It is heard that due to the lack of food here, shops have now been established to specialize in selling horse meat. Note: Santander is located in northern Spain, 47 miles from Bilbao. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Prisoner Exchange Talks Break Down</h3>
<p>Bilbao: According to a statement issued by the Basque government, the negotiations between the Basque and Nationalist forces on the exchange of prisoners have broken down. Note: These negotiations had been progressing smoothly recently. The breakdown is attributed to the attitude of the Basque government. Hundreds of Basque families were greatly disappointed after this news was released, as they had initially thought that the exchange of 4,000 prisoners between the Spanish government and the Nationalist forces would be successful. It is believed that military service age is the main point of difficulty. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<h3>Submarine Activity in Spanish Territorial Waters</h3>
<p>Two Government Merchant Ships Narrowly Missed by Torpedoes</p>
<p>[London] Naval activity off the coast of Spain is also increasing. The Soviet cargo ship "Tsyuryupa" carrying 3,500 tons of grain, which had been detained by the Spanish Nationalist forces, has been released from the port of Pasajes in the Bay of Biscay. The Norwegian ship "Ibis," which was captured by the Nationalist forces yesterday, has been released from the port of Algeciras. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>⊙Valencia: The Spanish government-owned merchant ship "Ciudad de Madrid" was en route from Marseille to Alicante when it encountered a submarine in the waters off the city of Cullera, which fired a torpedo at it. Fortunately, it missed. In addition, another merchant ship, "Ciudad de Barcelona," was also attacked by a submarine in the area near Cullera, which fired several torpedoes, all of which missed. It is generally believed that the two attacks were carried out by the same submarine, but it is still unknown which side the submarine belongs to. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>British Independent Labour Party</h3>
<p>Twenty-Five Members Go to Spain to Serve</p>
<p>[London] Twenty-five members of the Independent Labour Party, led by one of the party's leaders, Edward, departed from here this morning for Spain to serve in the government army. One of them made a statement to the press before his departure, saying that there were originally 100 people who signed up, but the organizers only selected 25 of them. None of us have family burdens, and we do not receive any pay, and even the travel expenses required are paid by ourselves. But when they departed, a woman suddenly shouted at them, "You are committing suicide!" (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Former Envoy Refuses to Hand Over Power</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden: The newly appointed Spanish envoy to Sweden, Mrs. Valencia, has arrived here.

<h3>American and Russian Newspapers Comment on the European Situation</h3>
<p>Peace is Threatened; Germany and Italy Should Be Held Responsible</p>
<p>[Washington] The situation of German activities in Spanish Morocco is currently being closely watched by various newspapers. Editorials in the evening papers clearly point out that Germany and Italy should be held responsible for the chaotic European situation. The "Evening Star" said, "The negotiations in London on non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War will inevitably be delayed, and the result will only benefit the Spanish rebels, allowing them to achieve a final victory with the assistance of Germany and Italy (volunteers from Germany and Italy have now secretly gathered in Spain). Even if the Adjustment Committee for Non-Intervention wants to take action in the future, the rebels will have already won the battle, and the fascist faction will have established its regime throughout Spain. It will be too late to regret it. This is what we are deeply concerned about." The "New York Post" said, "If anyone wants to cause international disputes now, it is German Chancellor Hitler. For three years, Hitler has repeatedly trampled on various international treaties. There are three reasons for this: After the Treaty of Versailles was signed, people all over the world mostly expressed sympathy for the German people. This is the first reason. Britain, France, and Germany's other neighbors are willing to tolerate Germany's provocative actions rather than retaliate with force. This is the second reason. Germany's neighbors have failed to remain united throughout. This is the third reason. But now it is different. Hitler's situation is very different from before. Britain and France cannot ignore Germany's activities in Morocco and let them run their course. If Germany succeeds in Morocco, it will be tantamount to allowing Germany to attack France from both the north and south, and cut off France's transportation with Morocco. If Hitler has not completely lost his mind, he should stop at the right time and not go too far." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The government newspaper Izvestia recently commented on the replies of Italy and Germany regarding the issue of banning volunteers from going to Spain, saying, "From this reply, it can be seen that Italy and Germany's intention is to intensify their intervention in the Spanish Civil War. This does not need to be analyzed, and the content of the reply can show it. The actions of the fascist countries in Spain have been seen and heard by the world. While Germany and Italy sent replies, troops from both countries were attacking the positions of the Spanish Republican Army under the city of Madrid. This is a well-known fact. And it is not only the case in Spain itself, but also in Spanish Morocco, where civil and military power is now actually in the hands of foreign interveners, especially Germany. The only way for countries that aspire to peace and have no intention of launching a war to prevent the fascist countries from realizing their conspiracy is to unite." (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Italy Actively Expands Military</h3>
<p>Military Expenditures for the Army and Navy Increase Sharply; Cabinet Decides to Develop Road Network in East Africa and Prohibits People from Marrying Indigenous Africans</p>
<p>[Rome] Following the trend of expanding armaments around the world, the cabinet has approved an increase in the military budget for 1938. The army's budget for this year is 120,621,150 lire, and will increase to 131,115,115 lire next year. The navy will also increase from 81,291,600 lire to 94,348,000 lire. Currently, the total budget for 1938 has a shortfall of 167,058,450 lire after offsetting income and expenditure. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Today's cabinet meeting approved several important orders, including one order stipulating that the Secretary-General of the Fascist Party shall enjoy the status of a cabinet member. Another order is to develop the road network in Italian East Africa, with particular emphasis on the maintenance and expansion of the Libyan automobile road. Another order stipulates that a colonial exhibition shall be held every three years to showcase the progress of Italian colonies. The first exhibition will be held in 1938. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>[Rome] In order to protect the purity of the Italian race, the cabinet has decided to punish Italians who enter into marital relations with Abyssinian natives. According to a statement issued by the authorities today, the penalty is intended as a warning, not to punish people severely, because the Fascist government fully trusts that the people residing in Abyssinia will have a good understanding of the dignity of citizens and the success of politics.

<h3>Dissatisfaction of Japanese Political Parties with Arita Diplomacy</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Foreign Affairs Roundtable, a gathering of like-minded members from the Seiyukai and Minseito parties who advocate for the reassessment of Arita diplomacy and aim to alter foreign policy, convened at Tokiwa within Van Chih on the evening of the 9th. Attendees included Koyama (Matsuju), Tawar, Yamamichi, and Saito from the Minseito party, as well as Hamada, Azuma, and Uehara from the Seiyukai. As a result of candidly exchanging views on Arita diplomacy, they all agreed that the current cabinet's foreign policy lacked a consistent and firm guiding principle, leading to repeated failures. In the face of the current extraordinary situation, it has fallen into complete deadlock. If left unattended, it will inevitably lead to irreparable consequences. If a shift in direction is not initiated today and a better approach is not sought under a new policy, a significant crisis will inevitably arise. Subsequently, they discussed methods for reassessing Arita diplomacy. The result was a decision that, while both parties have not yet made a decision on the matter, they must each actively work within their respective parties to promote progress in the direction of reassessing Arita diplomacy. It is said that today, taking this meeting as an opportunity, the cross-party liaison movement of both parties is gradually intensifying. (10th, Domei News)</p>

<h3>Trotsky Arrives in Mexico</h3>
<p>Releases a lengthy declaration, acknowledging that a European war is difficult to avoid, and refrains from commenting on the Spanish situation</p>
<p>Mexico, Tampico Port: Leon Trotsky, the leader of the anti-establishment faction of the Soviet Communist Party, arrived here this morning from Norway and has already departed for Mexico City. (9th, Havas News)</p>
<p>Tampico Port: Leon Trotsky, having been granted special permission by the Mexican authorities to relocate from Sweden to Mexico, arrived here on the Norwegian ship "Ruth" at 8:15 this morning. Many Mexican dignitaries welcomed him at the pier, including the painter Rivera (leader of the Mexican Trotskyist faction), his wife Frida, General Guerrero, the garrison commander of Tampico Port, Mayor Martinan, and Shardman, Trotsky's representative in New York City. Government officials had kept the ship's schedule strictly confidential beforehand and had mobilized two battalions of troops and numerous police officers to prevent any unforeseen incidents. However, the result was good order, and no incidents occurred. After the ship docked, Trotsky, wearing a dark gray golf suit and a dark red tie, smiled and told people that the sea voyage had been quite beneficial to his health. He also said that he was deeply grateful for the Mexican government's willingness to grant him residence and that he would certainly live up to their kindness, "and do his best for Mexico." He also intends to visit New York in the near future. Trotsky then delivered a lengthy declaration in French, which was immediately translated into English, stating in brief that he felt deep sympathy for the Norwegian people. On his way to Mexico, he received numerous telegrams from various American news agencies and major newspapers asking him to answer several questions. However, because the Norwegian government had previously ordered the captain of the "Mans" to prohibit Trotsky from using wireless communication to communicate with other places, even communicating with American friends on private matters was not allowed. Therefore, he was unable to answer the telegrams he received. "When I set out, the European situation was restless, and the signs of war were countless, people were panic-stricken and could not live in peace, and all kinds of rumors spread without wings. My enemies took the opportunity to spread various messages to my disadvantage. Now I intend to make my plans and thoughts public, without concealment, hoping that most newspapers in the New World will adopt an objective spirit and comment on them." He also said, "The ingredients for the outbreak of war in Europe already account for 75 percent." Regarding the situation in Spain, he declined to comment, saying that he had been unaware of outside news for twenty days on the way. The Mexican government has now prepared an airplane and a special car for Trotsky to choose from and go wherever he wants. (9th, Havas News)</p>
<p>Mexico City: The Mexican Communist Party recently issued a declaration stating that it would hold a demonstration when Trotsky arrived here and demanded that the government not allow Trotsky to stay in the country for long. (10th, Havas News Agency)</p>

<h3>Unification of Authority in American Territories</h3>
<p>Senator makes proposal</p>
<p>[Washington] There are many proposals in Congress today, the most noteworthy of which is Senator Gibson's re-submission of the bill to establish a Department of Territories, which was not resolved in the previous Congress. Gibson suggests that the department be headed by a minister with an annual salary of 15,000 yuan, with jurisdiction over various overseas territories such as the Philippines, Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, Midway Island, Palmyra Island, and Wake Island. Because the Philippines currently belongs to the Department of the Army, Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands belong to the Department of the Interior, and the remaining islands belong to the Department of the Navy, the authority is not unified. Therefore, Gibson claims that he will vigorously promote the passage of the bill in the upcoming Congress. Congressman Costello proposed prohibiting the import of American flags manufactured abroad, in order to prevent American flags from being printed with the words "Made in Japan."

<h3>Deadlock in Negotiations on Export of Lu Salt</h3>
<p>The Japanese side hopes to lower the price, but we have not agreed. The Kito puppet organization plots to occupy various salt fields, and private salt invades Tianjin and Beijing, affecting tax revenue.</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The export of Lu salt remains an intractable issue between China and Japan in North China. Last year, Mitsubishi Corporation ordered 70,000 tons in the name of manufacturing chemical salt. The authorities, considering the matter repeatedly, allowed foreign transportation, which was an unprecedented exception in the past fifty years. The contract was originally limited to one year and expired last winter. This year, the Japanese side needs several times more Lu salt than last year, with a planned order of at least 250,000 tons and at most 300,000 tons, to be ordered by the Xingzhong Company. Some time ago, Nagai Jyunichi, the commercial vice-consul of the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin, accompanied Hirayama, the Tianjin director of the Xingzhong Company, to directly negotiate with the salt field owners of Changlu, in an attempt to bypass our official procedures to avoid difficulties and achieve their procurement goals. However, the salt field owners mostly stated that the price they received for the salt sold last year was only two yuan and forty cents per ton, which was not even enough to cover the cost, and they had no profit to gain, so they were quite indifferent to foreign sales. Although the salt field owners established the Lufeng Store last year specifically to handle Lu salt exports, the store has not been closed, but it has no intention of undertaking the business. Therefore, the direct contact with the Xingzhong Company this time did not yield any results. Recently, they resumed negotiations with the Changlu Salt Transportation Commissioner's Office. The Transportation Commissioner's Office, based on reports from the general salt field owners, deeply felt that the current salt reserves in the Hangu and Xinhe salt fields, in addition to supplying the Huabei market, amount to at most only 100,000 tons. The Japanese side plans to purchase 250,000 to 300,000 tons, which is impossible to fulfill in terms of quantity. As for the price, last year's price was two yuan and forty cents per ton, and the salt field owners were already complaining bitterly. If they follow the Xingzhong Company's intention, the purchase price this year will not only not increase, but will instead be reduced to two yuan and ten cents per ton, which is really difficult to achieve. The Transportation Commissioner's Office believes that the minimum price demanded by the salt field owners should not be less than three yuan per ton, which is the most fair price. If the Japanese side can purchase within the quantity of 100,000 tons, they can mediate with the salt field owners to slightly reduce the price, which can be between two yuan and ninety cents and two yuan and ninety-six cents per ton. If both sides are interested, the Transportation Commissioner's Office still cannot make a decision on its own and must request approval from the Ministry of Finance before it can be implemented. As of today, the surface negotiations have come to a standstill, and the Japanese side is seeking other ways to choose convenient methods to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Since the tenth of last year, the amount of private salt transported from the Jidong area to Tianjin and Beijing for sale has gradually increased from more than 500 dan per month to 1,000 dan. The source is quite ambiguous. The government only knows that it is transported from Dalian and Yingkou. Therefore, many people suspect that it is related to the Lu salt exported last year. Although the Changlu Transportation Commissioner's Office police are trying their best to intercept it, this matter is the same as the smuggling situation in the North China Customs. Every time private salt is transported, there are ronin bodyguards, and the tax police are not allowed to approach for inspection. If the situation continues, the problem of private sales is likely to gradually become rampant. The pseudo-Jidong government is currently planning to expand, and plans to forcibly occupy the Changlu salt fields east of Tanggu after the implementation. It was originally rumored that it would be implemented on New Year's Day, but it was slightly delayed due to the Transportation Commissioner's Office's negotiations on both sides. However, this is related to the Japanese side's purchase and transportation of Lu salt for export. If we insist on the price and refuse to reach a deal, the Japanese side will use any means, or manipulate the Jidong pseudo-organization to quickly forcibly occupy the salt fields, which is not impossible. Although there are still no accurate statistics on Lu salt tax revenue last year, it is at most only 13 million yuan. Because since February last year, the Transportation Commissioner's Office has been allocating 250,000 yuan of tax revenue to the Jidong pseudo-organization every month in the name of assistance, totaling 3 million yuan for the whole year. In addition to rampant smuggling, the tax revenue loss is only about 13 million yuan in actual income. (9th)</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on the New Year in the Old Capital</h3>
<p>Special Correspondence from Beiping: As a general rule, the New Year's holidays for various agencies and schools are all three days, and the celebrations, etc., are also limited to three days. However, in the old capital, it is not very consistent. For example, some newspaper offices have one-day holidays, and some have three-day holidays. Also, some schools have one-day New Year's holidays, and some have one-week holidays. The Jicha authorities hold New Year's plays at Huiren Hall to entertain guests from all walks of life, which is similar to the abolished lunar New Year, and continues for five days. As for the general public, they showed New Year's scenes as early as the end of last month, and they have not changed until now. It will probably be more than ten days before they can return to normal. For example, the New Year's market in Changdian was originally scheduled to open for ten days, but in reality, it lasted for more than half a month, which is one example.</p>
<p>However, the widespread and official start of the New Year was indeed on the first of this month. Until now, a week has passed. Although the New Year's atmosphere has not yet passed, the enthusiasm has indeed faded slightly. Especially for various agencies and schools, because regular work has returned to normal, they have to return to normal. What is recorded here is the general situation of various aspects in the past week.</p>
<p>Someone scatters pseudo flags</p>
<p>In the latter half of last month, Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanjing from shadow exile, and the whole city was filled with an atmosphere of jubilation. In a few days, it was the Gregorian New Year, and the whole city celebrated with joy. Therefore, the continuous firecrackers from the eve of the first day to the fifth or sixth day intensified. The national flag of Blue Sky, White Sun, and Wholly Red Earth had already fluttered all over the roofs and eaves of the streets and alleys at the first dawn. Unexpectedly, the next day (the second), at about ten o'clock in the morning, there was suddenly a sound of airplanes rumbling from the eastern sky. The crowd looked up. Everyone initially thought that the pseudo-authorities were distributing announcements to the people. Just as they were looking forward to it, the fuselage gradually approached and flew lower and lower. What was presented to everyone's eyes was the emblem of a certain country's sun. At the same time, a large number of paper pieces were dropped from the aircraft. In addition to the red, yellow, blue, white, and black five-color flags of the Jidong pseudo-organization, there was also a so-called flag-protecting declaration, whose wording was extremely absurd. Even the words and sentences were semi-literate and uncultured Chinese. Using this to propagandize to the people, at best, only added to everyone's after-dinner conversation material.</p>
<p>The fate of drug offenders is slightly extended</p>
<p>All severe drug offenders in the country will be subject to the death penalty once captured from January 1 of this year. There have long been clear orders, and the Jicha Pingjin local authorities have especially repeatedly emphasized and earnestly exhorted this. They have established drug rehabilitation centers, ordered drug offenders to parade through the streets and give testimonials, posted slogans, posted notices, and sent patrol police to repeatedly warn door-to-door, and used various newspapers to publicize the phrase "death on January 1" repeatedly. In addition, more than a thousand coffins were prepared in the suburbs, and many pits were dug in advance for burial. All of these are nothing more than showing a heart of not being able to bear to kill without teaching, hoping that drug offenders will return from the wrong path. However, the situation in Pingdi is special. Most of the drug dens are opened by ronin or Koreans from a certain country, who use consular jurisdiction as a talisman and their drug dens as a hiding place for our country's drug offenders. From the end of December last year, the number of drug offenders living in various drug dens was already overcrowded. Especially from November 31 to around January 1 and 2 of this year, almost all drug offenders in the city had disappeared like water and birds, and most of them hid in drug dens. Under this situation, if they were to be searched and seized without the consent of a certain party, the unexpected disputes and troubles would be within expectations. This is one of the reasons why the authorities had to hesitate slightly before proceeding with law enforcement to punish them. Secondly, during the New Year period, various agencies were on vacation, and all search, arrest, and execution work had to wait until after the holidays. Therefore, various drug offenders were also able to take refuge in the celebration of this New Year. In addition, there are more than tens of thousands of drug offenders in Ping City, which is too many. If the law is strictly enforced, the corpses should be piled up like hills, and the blood should flow like a pestle. There are many charitable organizations and private individuals who have compassionate hearts and turn to the authorities to request a postponement of three or two months so that they can find ways to rehabilitate them. For example, the Ping City Chamber of Commerce once submitted a request to open up the net and drive them to serve as labor, which is one example. However, it is heard that the authorities' attitude is quite firm. Although Song Zheyuan has approved it for the Sui Shu to handle, it seems that the hope of obtaining an extension and leniency is also very slim. Probably after the New Year's scenes pass, the fate of drug offenders can be determined. It is said that a large-scale search and arrest has begun on the 7th.</p>
<p>The Happy Gathering at Huiren Hall</p>
<p>For a year, North China has been suffering. Just like after the Xi'an Incident not far away, a certain party planned to take advantage of the situation to expand the Jidong pseudo-organization to Pingjin Jicha. Fortunately, the Xi'an Incident was successfully resolved, and this place also felt relieved. Therefore, the authorities held an expanded celebration, and from the first day to the fifth day, plays were performed at Huiren Hall for five days to entertain all walks of life. In addition to the famous actors Yang Xiaolou, Cheng Yanqiu, Hao Shouchun, Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Hou Xirui, Xiao Cuihua, Wang Youchen, Ma Fulu, etc., the rest were mainly children from the Fuliangcheng Drama School, which is famous here. Almost all the famous actors in the old capital were recruited, and what they performed were all the actors' best plays, such as Ma Lianliang's Ganlu Temple, Tan Fuying's Dingjun Mountain, Cheng Yanqiu's Hongfu Biography, Xun Huisheng, Ma Fulu, and the joint performance of Xiao Fangniu, etc. The agencies and people from all walks of life who were invited were also very numerous. It is estimated that on the first day, there were more than a thousand people from the Political Affairs Committee, its affiliated Law, Foreign Affairs, Economic, Construction, and Transportation Committees, and the Jicha Clearing and Checking Office. On the first day, there were also more than a thousand people from the military police agencies. On the third day, there were personnel from various agencies under the Beiping Municipal Government, as well as postal, telecommunications, judicial, and cultural agencies. The fourth day was for entertaining foreign guests, and the fifth day was for people from the business, banking, and news circles.</p>
<p>Release of Petty Criminals</p>
<p>In order to show the spirit of renewing with the people, the authorities here previously notified the judicial authorities to select some prisoners with minor crimes and with evidence of good behavior and repentance from various prisons in accordance with the method of dredging prisoners through judicial administration and release them on New Year's Day. After the judicial authorities verified the results, a total of four or five hundred prisoners were released on New Year's Day, and those who were far away were given travel expenses to return home.</p>
<h3>Emergency Relief for Various Counties in Henan Province</h3>
<p>Selected heavily disaster-stricken counties to allocate emergency relief funds</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The Henan Provincial Relief Association previously received 300,000 yuan of public debt bonds allocated by the Executive Yuan (equivalent to 183,533.78 yuan in cash), together with 30,000 yuan of emergency relief funds allocated from the province's disaster relief reserve, totaling more than 203,000 yuan in cash. In the current winter season, on the 7th, it specially selected 27 counties with the most severe drought, divided them into different grades, distributed them in advance, and formulated regulations for investigation and distribution, ordering them to comply. The number of relief funds allocated to severely disaster-stricken counties has also been stipulated. Yuxian, Mixian, Dengfeng, Yiyang, Songxian, Yiyang, and Rushan, etc., are listed as the most severe first-class disaster-stricken counties, with each county allocated 12,000 yuan of relief funds. Xiangcheng, Mengjin, Yichuan, Mianchi, Xin'an, Shenqiu, Shanxian, Luoning, Wenxiang, Lushi, Zhengxian, and Lingbin, etc., are listed as the most severe second-class disaster-stricken counties, with each county allocated 8,000 yuan of relief funds. Huaxian, Shangshui, Xihua, Fengqiu, Yanshi, Yanjin, Luoyang, and Lushan, etc., are listed as the most severe third-class disaster-stricken counties, with each county allocated 4,000 yuan of relief funds.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Two Major Robbery Cases on Land and Water</p>
<p>A certain egg shop in Sijing Town, District 1 of this county, has a thriving business and sells to the Shanghai area. On the 9th, the shop transported 2,000 baskets of eggs, each basket containing about 2,000 eggs, and hired a boat to transport them to Shanghai for sale. However, at 1:00 PM, when passing through the Longhua Rihui Port area, two bandit boats suddenly came and jumped onto the egg boat, tied up the boatmen, and unloaded the eggs onto the bandit boats. The bandit boats sailed away. The tied-up boatmen, seeing the eggs being stolen, shouted for help and were rescued by a neighboring boat. They returned to Songjiang to report to the County Public Security Bureau to request an arrest. It is said that the loss is about 13,000 yuan. Also, the wealthy Zhang family in Mapeng, District 8, was robbed by many bandits on the night of the 7th, and more than 20,000 yuan was looted. The District Office has reported the matter to the county.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Establishment of the Law Society Branch</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Branch of the Republic of China Law Society was organized and established in April last year. The General Assembly appointed Zhu Shusheng and 13 others as preparatory committee members. On the 10th of this month, the inaugural meeting was held at the Jiangsu Higher Court in Suzhou. The General Assembly sent Vice Chairman Qin Zhen to attend as a representative. At the inaugural meeting, Chairman Zhu Shusheng first reported on the preparatory process, followed by a speech by Qin Zhen. Then, directors were elected. As a result, Zhu Shusheng, Sun Honglin, Lu Yimei, Qian Sen, Shen Yuan, Liu Yun, Hu Shancheng, Shen Binqian, Cai Zhaoying, Dai Tianqiu, Luo Shishi, Tian Wennong, Fang Wen, Zhong Zhihan, Wu Yuheng, and 15 others were elected as directors. Chen Liren, Zhou Shaocheng, and 7 others were elected as alternate directors. The five standing directors will be selected by the branch and reported to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>Recruitment of Judicial Police</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Higher Court has been actively preparing for the establishment of local courts in various counties in recent years. As the local courts in Huaiyin, Taixian, Rugao, Dongtai, and Changshu have been prepared and are about to be established, a large number of judicial police are needed to facilitate service. Therefore, 50 to 60 judicial police officers are specially recruited. Registration will begin on the 11th and end on the 22nd. The examination will be held at Suzhou Middle School in Sanyuanfang from the morning of the 21st. Anyone who has graduated from higher primary school or has an equivalent level, and is between 25 and 40 years old, can go to register for the examination. Once admitted, they must be assigned to serve in the local courts of various counties.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Broke up a large drug manufacturing organization</p>
<p>Lin Wei, the acting director of the Public Security Bureau of this county, received a confidential report on the 9th stating that Zhou Yu, the wife of Zhou Rongquan, a drug offender who had been executed, was continuing to set up an organization to manufacture red pills in An Di Li, District 5, on a large and extremely secretive scale. The headquarters was located at Jiang Gao's home. The director immediately ordered inspector Tong Guodong to cooperate with Gu Jiafeng, the captain of the security police team, and Liao Dingjie, the director of the Public Security Branch 4, to lead 20 armed police officers to the countryside that evening around 8:00 PM. They joined forces with Su Guangyi, the town chief, Jiang Jiahe, the Bao chief, and Jiang Tinggen, the Jia chief, to surround the homes of Jiang Gao and Zhou Yu separately. They searched the rooms and in a panic, Jiang Gao threw a bag of powdered milk candy, the raw material for manufacturing red pills, out of the window. It was immediately picked up by the police. The police then went upstairs and searched in detail. They found a secret organization behind Jiang Gao's bed sheets and curtains. They seized two sets of red pill manufacturing machines, red pill boards, a balance, a steelyard, 1.1 liang of corrupt pills, 2 fen of opium bubbles, 2 liang of powdered milk candy, 25 wax papers, one steaming sieve, one iron spoon, two stamping lids, one brush broom, one piece of face powder, one liang of red pill stamping scraps, one empty Qianhu brand pill box, and one rattan basket. Jiang Gao was arrested, and Lu Xianglin and Zhou Zhuoyun were also arrested. Jiang Gao claimed that the machinery was hidden in his home by Su Wenzhi. Inspector Tong and others went to Su's home to search and arrested Su Wenzhi. Finally, the police went to Zhou Yu's home to search and found only 1 fen of opium bubbles, and nothing else was seized. The main offender, Zhou Yu, escaped because she rented another house to live in. The police and others escorted the witnesses to the city at about 2:00 AM on the 10th and sent them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Investigate Deed Tax on Squeezed Fields and Houses</p>
<p>The county government believes that when the villagers in various districts and townships of this county buy fields and houses, they mostly privately establish white deeds and do not comply with the regulations to purchase official deeds, resulting in hidden and evaded taxes. Although strict investigations and squeezing have been carried out, omissions are still inevitable. Now, at the time of land registration, it is necessary to strictly rectify this in order to increase tax revenue. In addition to sending personnel to various districts to reside and investigate and squeeze, the Land Administration Bureau was ordered yesterday to assist the various district chiefs properly.</p>
<p>A Major Fire Causes Losses of Millions</p>
<p>The Nanxiang Shanghoubei near the Slaughtering Cattle Workshop outside the East Gate of this county, along the railway, has dozens of acres of wasteland that have been rented by Jiangbei coolies to build thatched shacks, no less than a hundred, housing two or three hundred households. There are old railway sleepers around to prevent thieves. At about 2:00 PM on the 10th, He Meng, an old woman living in a shack on the west side, accidentally dropped a spark while cooking, causing a fire. At that time, a strong northwest wind was blowing, and the fire was fierce, and the smoke was so thick that it was impossible to approach. All the shack dwellers ran to the mountains to snatch their belongings. The fire brigade in each section heard the alarm and drove the dragon to rescue, and the fire was extinguished at 3:30 PM. All the thatched shacks there were completely burned, with a total loss of more than 10,000 yuan. The Dalun Silkworm Moth Factory on the east side was also burned down, with a loss of several thousand yuan. The old woman, He Meng, who started the fire, was unable to escape and was severely burned all over her body and seriously injured.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Electric Hair Perming Causes Disaster</p>
<p>The Wuyi Barber Association once banned electric hair perming due to its potential dangers. Later, steam perming was used, but electric perming became popular again. Mei Xingda, a woman from Mopan Bridge, went to the "Beautiful" barber shop on Main Street to get her hair permed, but suffered an electric shock, completely destroying her hair and injuring her brain. She is currently receiving treatment at Wujin Hospital. Unexpectedly, at the end of last month, Mrs. Xu, wife of Pan Qingxiang of Xunxiang Bathhouse, also encountered danger while getting her hair permed at the same shop, suffering severe head injuries. Despite extensive medical treatment, little improvement was seen. On the morning of the 8th, she suddenly fainted from the pain and was rushed to the Red Swastika Society Hospital for treatment. Doctors say her condition is quite critical. Her husband, Pan Qingxiang, immediately entered into negotiations with the "Beautiful" barber shop, leading to a brawl and injuries. The case was reported to the First Public Security Bureau for investigation. The bureau chief, Si Daoping, also received a letter from the New Transport Promotion Association requesting that the police strictly prohibit electric and steam hair perming. As a result, this type of hair perming has completely disappeared from the market.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Planning to Build a Qingzhen Brick Road</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that Qingzhen's land transportation is maintained only by the Yangqing Line's buses. However, the road is not well maintained, and although counties along the canal have tendered for repairs, buses can only travel on sunny days. In rainy weather, the roads become muddy and buses stop running. To facilitate Qingzhen's transportation, the provincial government has allocated funds to rebuild the road with stone. It has repeatedly ordered the county magistrates along the canal to demolish all houses and obstacles along the route to facilitate road construction. The magistrates of Huaiyin and Huaian counties have ordered residents to demolish houses along the line immediately. Jiangdu and Gaobao are demolishing them as well. It is heard that road construction will begin soon.</p>
<p>Drug Trafficking Ring Cracked</p>
<p>The Provincial Public Security Bureau's Political Police Team received a tip that the Hong Taixiang shop at No. 127 Shanxiang Alley outside the city was actually a drug trafficking ring. The team, led by patrol officer Wang Tianniao of the Second Precinct of the Public Security Bureau, raided the shop around 4 p.m. on the 8th. They discovered two small packages of heroin and took the shop owner, Liu Hongtai, into custody for questioning. Liu, who lives near the Four Railway Stations in Paiwan, had been trafficking drugs for a long time and recently moved to Shanxiang Alley to open a spice shop as a cover. The shop had not yet opened when it was raided. After questioning, the bureau prepared a document to hand him over to the Garrison Headquarters for legal action.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Escorting Ships on the Lower Yangtze River</p>
<p>Recently, bandits have been frequently appearing on the lower Yangtze River, intercepting merchant ships. The Third District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police has been ordered to form a special river patrol team to escort ships and deploy the Haiying and Junhe police ships for patrol.</p>
<p>Allocating National Salvation Savings</p>
<p>All sectors of Tongyi raised National Salvation Savings during the "February 28th Incident." In addition to a portion that was remitted at the time, the remaining funds will be used to purchase aircraft and to慰勞綏軍. The interest will be allocated to the relief院 as a base民 loan fund.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Change of Zhang Taiyan's Burial Site</p>
<p>Zhang Taiyan's state burial was planned for West Lake. The burial site was initially determined to be Zhongtai Mountain. However, due to the presence of sand and gravel, construction would be difficult. Furthermore, the access road would require the relocation of other people's tombs. Therefore, Zhang's widow advocated abandoning this site. After days of inspection by Zhang's widow, son, and others, Longjing was deemed the most suitable location. Moreover, Zhang's ancestral tomb is also nearby. Wang Dong, a member of the state burial preparation committee, came to Hangzhou yesterday to survey the site and agreed. Wang is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 10th, and a meeting will be held next week to finalize the decision. Wang Tingyang and Du Shenfu, the director and deputy director of the state burial office in Hangzhou, are scheduled to establish an office on the 10th and begin collecting 民地. Zhang's tomb will require more than ten acres of land. An engineer will be hired to design it, and the state burial ceremony may be held in March.</p>

At 9:30 a.m., the doors opened, and visitors entered in an orderly fashion. The first people standing in the front were one Chinese person and one Westerner, who yielded to each other. Ultimately, the Westerner said that since it was a Chinese museum, Chinese people should enter first. Therefore, the Chinese person entered first. Although this was a small matter, it had international significance. After 10 a.m., visitors arrived one after another, creating an extremely crowded scene. In the afternoon, Chinese and Western people visited the museum, creating an even more lively scene. In total, the number of visitors yesterday reached over 13,000.

Visitors already felt comfortable and happy, and the various exhibits were mostly rare and precious, dazzling the eyes. It was as if visitors had entered a scenic wonderland, leaving them overwhelmed. Everyone praised the museum for being able to collect so many famous and rare items in such a short period of time, and for using scientific methods in its exquisite and ingenious displays. They lingered and were reluctant to leave. When ticket sales stopped at 4 p.m., there were still many visitors requesting to enter. Because it was the first day of opening, the museum extended its hours by one hour. The Chinese Merchant Bus was crowded all day, and private cars came in an endless stream. It was the most grand occasion in the city center in a year.</p>

<h3>Patrick Arrived In Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>Office Is Under The British Embassy Mission Is To Investigate Our Industry And Commerce</p>
<p>Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credit Guarantee Bureau, arrived in China with his wife and assistant, Mr. O'Leary, aboard the British Company's "Rawa Pindi" ship to take office. The ship arrived at Wusongkou at 7 p.m. last night and entered Shanghai at 7 a.m. this morning, docking at the Gonghexiang Wharf on the Bund. At that time, Chinese and British officials will go to the wharf to welcome him. His position is subordinate to the British Embassy in China, and he will work in the same office as the Shanghai Office of the Embassy. For those who are unclear about the British Export Credit Guarantee Bureau and Patrick's mission to China, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired at the British Embassy yesterday. The British government has three major departments: Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Foreign Trade. The Credit Guarantee Bureau is a new organization that was established five or six years ago and is between the three major departments of Foreign Affairs, Finance, and Foreign Trade. It is also an independent agency. As for Patrick's mission to China, some say it is to negotiate loans, which may not be entirely true. Patrick's mission is to investigate the conditions of China's industrial, commercial, and financial markets and report them to the British government. The Credit Guarantee Bureau will then introduce them to British merchants, who will lend and sell goods to China according to China's needs, with particular emphasis on assistance in the field of machinery, it is said.</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After the meeting commenced, Chairman Zhang Shouyong of the presidium gave a report, stating briefly that recently there have been two schools of thought in intellectual circles: materialism and idealism, but both are too radical. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's historical view of the people's livelihood combines the strengths of both schools and forms a central mainstream, the philosophy of the only life. Promoting this central mainstream, humanity's desires lie in survival, so solving the problem of the people's livelihood is the central issue. We uphold this true meaning to complete our view of life and the universe, and then together with the nation, seek survival and development, which is what we can hope for. The purpose of this society is to resolve this central issue. We will also supplement it with mutual assistance and mutual trust, so that our cause can be promoted and benefit our country and nation.</p>
<p>Preparatory Process</p>
<p>Next, the representative of the preparatory committee reported on the preparatory process, saying that the initiation of the assembly was more than a year ago. After obtaining approval from party and government organs to establish it in mid-September of last autumn, the search for members began, and has reached over six hundred members to date. Some of the members are students, but the majority are revolutionary-minded young people serving society.</p>
<p>Chen's Admonition</p>
<p>Next, Chen Lifu's representative, Liu Bomin, gave an admonition, stating briefly that: (1) The study of the philosophy of the only life is Dr. Sun Yat-sen's highest ideal. The purpose of this society is to select the most important point in Dr. Sun's theory, study it, elucidate it, and promote it. (2) Looking at past organizations, many lacked perseverance, resulting in many starting strong but ending weakly. The establishment of an organization is an expression of determination, and maintaining the organization depends on perseverance. It is hoped that the members of this society can reverse the trend, persevere, and strive to advance the work of this society without end. (3) You must know that studying knowledge is not a leisure activity. You must pay attention to how this knowledge benefits the country and the nation. Things like humorous writing, what benefit do they ultimately have for the country and nation? Those that are not beneficial must be rejected. Only those that are beneficial are worth studying. The way of learning is closely related to the interests of the country and the nation. I hope the comrades of this society will pay attention to this. (4) Studying knowledge is difficult, especially the philosophy of the only life, the newest, most accurate, and greatest invention in the world. But since Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated it in the past, and Chen Lifu continued to elucidate it, it will be easier for the members of this society to study and promote it, because our work is explanatory rather than creative. It is hoped that the members of this society will apply these philosophical principles to their own studies and careers, persevere, be down-to-earth, and work hard, so as not to betray the establishment of this society today.</p>
<p>Pan's Admonition</p>
<p>After Chen Lifu's representative finished speaking, a representative from the Municipal Party Department spoke, followed by Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, who stated briefly that we recognize that the actions and careers of every nation and every individual are determined by the most fundamental philosophical thought. Revolutionary leaders and great statesmen, to promote doctrine and awaken the people, must fight, and the most basic first step of the struggle must start with thought, because thought can determine the goal of our actions, grasp the faith of the masses, and guide the direction of the masses. We must choose a correct philosophical theory as the basis of our revolutionary cause. This most correct philosophical thought is the philosophy of the only life. However, our responsibility in the future is not only to understand and explain this theory, but also to apply it to various social phenomena to prove its correctness. The fundamental driving force of the philosophy of the only life lies in the life unit and life force. The basic strength of this life element has four aspects: self-control, self-generation, self-defense, and self-colonization. These four forces are the forces of the entire life, which is called life force, or vitality. We firmly believe that only by applying these four forces to various undertakings can progress be made. Taking the country as an example, to seek the progress of the country (it must be able to manage itself (i.e., self-control), it must be able to be self-sufficient, clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and cannot rely on others (i.e., self-generation), it must be able to resist foreign insults (i.e., self-defense), and the nation must be able to reproduce (i.e., self-colonization). Only in this way can the nation make progress. It is hoped that the members of this society can base themselves on this vitality of life in their own research and work to seek the evolution of their personal careers and the country and the nation, and strive for the integration and promotion of this philosophical theory in everyone's actual life, so as to contribute to the revolution at the present stage.</p>

<p>Declaration</p>
<p>The Only Life Society Declaration: Idealism? Materialism? In recent decades, the question that has been most deeply ingrained in the minds of the Chinese people is probably this one. Idealists, trapped in superstition, are inherently conservative, often hindering social progress. Materialists, falling into狂暴, are like blind bombs, needlessly increasing the waste of revolution. Especially materialism, wearing the cloak of revolution, with its heretical theories infiltrating, is even more prone to魔. Thousands upon thousands of young students have wasted their energy and mental power on it. Thousands upon thousands of working people have been unemployed for nothing because of it. Even hundreds of thousands of soldiers and civilians have been displaced and their corpses piled up like mountains because of the scourge of materialism. The Xi'an Incident not long ago was unconsciously麻醉 by the heretical theories of materialism, and they did not hesitate to be traitors to the country and the nation. We are deeply aware of these tragic facts, and we feel that the elaboration of the Three People's Principles, especially the establishment of the theoretical foundation of the Three People's Principles in philosophy, is extremely necessary. "Life is the center of the universe, and people's livelihood is the center of human history." These two sentences are the foundation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's doctrine. Now that the political foundation of the Three People's Principles has been established, the establishment of philosophical theory is of course becoming more and more important. The philosophy of the only life, which Chen Lifu has repeatedly spoken about in recent years, is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's historical view of the people's livelihood, and it is a philosophical theory that proves its certainty with scientific methods. This philosophical theory can be said to be a treasure unearthed from the five thousand years of Chinese cultural history. Elucidating the theory of the philosophy of the only life and promoting the doctrine of the historical view of the people's livelihood can not only eliminate superstition and dispel the source of chaos, but also restore the nation's self-confidence culturally and spiritually, and bring the country and the nation to a state of recovery and strength. China's strength and China's rejuvenation depend on China's own strength and China's own culture, and the most basic condition for this strength and culture is the establishment of philosophical theory. The philosophical concept of the philosophy of the only life is concretely and rigorously established, so that the strength of the nation can be brought into play and the culture of the nation can have a destination, then everything can be administered in an orderly manner, construction can be carried out in a structured manner, and the road to national rejuvenation can be embarked on. We are aware of the importance of the philosophy of the only life and the pain of the youth of the country wandering on the wrong path between idealism and materialism, so we have gathered more than seven hundred young people who are interested in studying philosophy, hoping to use the research of collective strength in an organized way to contribute to the philosophy of the only life that the country urgently needs. We must specifically explain about several aspects. (1) The college-style study of philosophy is obviously not possible for us. The philosophical theories of the "scholastic school" may not be of any help to the current turbulent society. Most of us have just left the school of struggle and are seeking to serve society. Even those who are still in school are not far from serving society. We cannot end our lives as students and must sooner or later become "social people." Therefore, our study of the philosophy of the only life must be practical from the beginning, opposing all utopian college-style. We must experience philosophy in life and study the progress of philosophy in the course of social service and struggle. (2) Because our attitude towards studying philosophy is realistic and inseparable from our real life, it affects the nature of our group, that is, we are not only gathering in a way to study academics, but also in a way to revolutionize and seek to serve society. Our individual members are not only academically related to each other, but we will also have close ties in life. Chen Lifu said in a speech on the philosophy of the only life that Westerners first discovered that "heat" is the center of gravity of matter and the driving force of matter, while the Chinese first discovered that "sincerity" is the center of gravity of spirit and the driving force of spirit. Therefore, the combination of our group should be a combination of "親愛精誠." In academics, we should encourage each other, and in life, we should do our best to help each other and trust each other. (3) We firmly believe that 空漠冥想 academics are of no help to facts, and that the philosophical essence, which is the source of cultural foundation and revolutionary power, can only be experienced in the life of actually serving society. Therefore, in the mutual assistance of members' lives, we expect to achieve job security, job introduction, low-interest loans, and special insurance, etc., and in terms of revolution and social service, every member must be able to work hard, practically go deep into society, and always serve others. The national situation is in crisis and has reached the final stage. We respectfully gather young comrades who usually get along with the heart of fearing the danger of national extinction, based on the belief of self-reliance and self-salvation, to seek a way to make a living for individuals and to seek survival for the country. We also hope that people of the country will correct us at any time.</p>

<h3>Relief Association for Disaster Victims in Suiyuan Pleads for Donations from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Tens of Thousands of Disaster Victims are Suffering from Hunger and Cold; Please Donate Generously for Relief</p>
<p>Since receiving telegrams from the Feng and Yang committees of the Charity Organization Joint Relief Association in this city, stating that the disaster victims in Suiyuan are suffering terribly from hunger and cold, and that tens of thousands of lives are in urgent need of relief, the association has, in addition to allocating 20,000 yuan from its savings to be remitted to Suiyuan for relief, continued to send letters to all sectors to solicit donations. Specifically, this association received a telegram yesterday from Standing Committee members Yang Mingsheng and Feng Xuefen, stating that in the Suiyuan area, many disaster victims have been injured or killed due to the effects of the war, and houses, livestock, and equipment have been damaged, which is currently being investigated. The residents in the war zone are now without clothing, food, or shelter, and are wandering as refugees, suffering terribly from hunger and cold. No fewer than tens of thousands of people urgently need relief. They still hope to raise relief funds (continuous assistance, to save the lives of the people, etc., according to the telegram). After receiving the telegram, this association has allocated 20,000 yuan to be remitted for relief. However, at this time of severe cold, the disaster victims are without clothing, food, or shelter, and their tragic situation is unbearable to speak of. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will have great compassion, generously open their purses, and donate enthusiastically so that this association can provide continuous relief to save the lives of tens of thousands of disaster victims. It is truly a boundless act of merit. The association also sent a telegram to the Yang and Feng committees, saying, (titles omitted) "Geng telegram received. The disaster victims in the war zone urgently need relief, which is deeply felt. Now, 20,000 yuan has been allocated first, to be handed over to the Bank of China on the Zhen day to be remitted to Suiyuan. Please check and receive it, strictly investigate and be lenient, and please send telegrams about the situation in the disaster area at any time. Sincerely, Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Relief Association."</p>
<h3>Second Payment of Loan to Beijing-Jiangxi Railway Syndicate</h3>
<p>Amount of Three Million Yuan Prepared for Payment Within Days; Railroad Ties Use Domestic Materials and Are Shipped from Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to extend the construction of the Beijing-Jiangxi Railway from Xuancheng in Anhui Province to Guixi in Jiangxi Province, the Ministry of Railways successfully borrowed 14 million yuan from a syndicate composed of eight banks, including the Bank of Communications. The syndicate then allocated 3 million yuan first. A reporter from the New News Agency learned that the Shanghai syndicate will continue to allocate 3 million yuan within this month in accordance with the contract provisions. The banks have prepared in accordance with their borrowing proportions and will pay it within days. The remaining 8 million yuan is scheduled to be paid in installments of 3 million yuan in April and July, and 2 million yuan in September. The construction of this section is actively underway, with over 10,000 workers stepping up the excavation of earthworks. It is expected that it will reach Tunxi by the end of next month. Regarding the railroad ties used along the route, most of them are made in China and are contracted by timber merchants in Xuan, Ning, Ji, and She counties in Anhui Province. Other materials, such as telephone lines, are shipped from Shanghai in batches by chartered vessels to Wu and transferred to Xuancheng via the Jiangnan Railway for use. Therefore, the construction of this railway is progressing rapidly.</p>
<h3>Seven Men and Women Burned to Death in the Back Road of the Arsenal Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Fire Started in a Charcoal Shop; Four Houses Destroyed; Seven Bodies Dug Out of the Rubble; It is Reported That a Man Named Yang is Still Missing</p>
<p>At around 2:20 AM yesterday morning, a charcoal shop at No. 55 Huixiang Alley, Manufacturing Bureau Back Road, Nanshi, suddenly caught fire, and flames immediately shot through the roof. The fire was fierce and spread to neighboring businesses, including Rongfuxing Tobacco Shop, a cooper shop, and a barber shop. Fortunately, the fire brigades from each district heard the alarm and immediately rushed to the scene with pump trucks to draw water and extinguish the fire. It was extinguished after about an hour. In this fire, four houses were destroyed. When the fire was raging, several men and women in the charcoal shop and the cooper shop were unaccounted for. Subsequently, firefighters dug through the rubble and uncovered seven bodies of various sizes. The families of the victims arrived at the scene to identify the bodies, but they were charred beyond recognition. Afterwards, the Huining Road Police Station in charge dispatched police officers to investigate and identify the names of the men and women who were burned to death. They included Wang Denggao, the owner of the charcoal shop, from Ningbo, 35 years old, his mother Wang Jiang, 61 years old, his son Wang Yuangen, 7 years old, his daughter Geng Hua, 5 years old, and a couple from Tongzhou, Yuan Zhongqing and his wife. In addition, there was Wang Yuande, a tenant in the cooper shop, 21 years old, from Ningbo. Yao Guangnai, director of the Ximen Branch in charge, upon hearing the report, was still concerned that there might be more bodies in the fire site, so he ordered the firefighters to continue digging through the rubble. At the same time, he sent police to investigate the cause of the fire and reported it to the General Bureau for investigation. However, after a detailed investigation, it was found that Yang Yutian, a tenant at No. 55, was said to be missing, and the police station is currently investigating.</p>

<p>Shi Yuanfu from Haimen recently hired Zhang Jinbin, a local, and a woman named Wang Shen as accomplices in the house at No. 27, Lane 59, Huaji Road to open an opium den, specializing in selling the drugs red pills and heroin for profit. This was discovered by Chinese detectives Li Zhaogen and Wang Dongchen of the Huishan Police Station. At 8:40 PM the day before, they secretly went to the address with Western detective Vit, arrested Shi Yuanfu, Zhang Jinbin, and Wang Shen, along with Yong Ren Lin Kuixian, Haimen people Yu Xiangming and Xue Xiliang, and a suspected woman Zhang Shen, as well as 55 small packets of heroin, 264 red pills, six small heroin guns, one red pill gun, and a lamp. They were all taken to the police station, detained separately, and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court the day before. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution in accordance with Articles 6 and 8 of the Provisional Regulations on Prohibition of Drugs, and stated that Zhang Jinbin confessed at the police station that the heroin and red pills were transported daily from a Japanese person residing in Zhabei. He requested strict punishment. Subsequently, the Chinese and Western detectives reported the details of the case, presenting the evidence for inspection. When questioned, the defendants' statements were evasive. Lin Kuixian, Yu Xiangming, and Xue Xiliang claimed that they went there to find friends and did not take drugs, asking for verification. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered a seven-day postponement for investigation and verification. The three defendants, Lin, Yu, and Xue, were transferred to the detention center to await forensic examination.</p>
<h3>Another Robber of Jewelry from a Dancing Girl Apprehended</h3>
<p>Fugitive Qiu Yonggui Instigated the Crime; Shen Lili Did Not Appear in Court Due to Illness</p>
<p>Jin Huiying and Shen Lili, local dancing girls residing at No. 130 Xinzha Road, were returning home from the Da Hu Dance Hall on Jing'an Temple Road at 2:15 AM on the morning of September 25 last year, riding in the same rickshaw. Near the intersection of Rue Bourgeat and Avenue Edward VII, they were stopped by three bandits who pulled out toy guns and threatened them into silence. They were robbed of two handbags containing a gold bracelet worth 80 yuan, two gold rings, several dance tickets, and cash, and then fled in a hurry. The next day, Zhang Xinbin, a Ningbo robber involved in the case, tried to pawn a gold bracelet at Yongde Pawnshop, No. 438 Wuzhou Road. Cao Jinbiao, a Chinese detective of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, found his behavior suspicious and arrested him. After questioning, he confessed to the crime and was sent to the First Special District Court, where he was sentenced to one year in prison. The day before yesterday, Detective Cao arrested another accomplice, Wang Xiaolinzi, a Ningbo native, and took him to the police station. The day before yesterday, he was sent to the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, explained the case, stating that Shen Lili, the victim, did not appear in court due to illness, and only Jin Huiying came to court to testify, requesting a postponement for investigation of another case. When questioned, the defendant admitted that he was instigated by Qiu Yonggui, who was still at large, and went to rob with Zhang Xinbin. Judge Zhong Qing ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Shanghai Bird Market</h3>
<p>Two Million Yuan Exported Annually; Plan to Form a Syndicate to Control Trade</p>
<p>Birds in this city are not only one of the main leisure products, but also a huge number are transported from various producing areas to Shanghai every year for re-export to foreign countries. At the same time, foreign-produced birds coming to China must also be imported through Shanghai. Therefore, this city is actually the only bird distribution market. The reporter of Shenzhou News Agency now records the general situation of the Shanghai bird market as follows:</p>
<p>Annual Turnover of Three Million Yuan</p>
<p>The currently popular birds are purely for ornamental purposes. Among them, although pigeons are used for more than ornamental purposes, their production, sales, and breeding numbers are extremely weak compared to the former. As for edible birds, only pigeons, sparrows, and doves are common. The annual turnover in the market has been less than 30,000 yuan in recent years, and there is a tendency to decline. Although this city is a bird distribution market for domestic and foreign countries, there is no bird production in Shanghai itself. Although the total annual turnover of the Shanghai bird market reaches three million yuan, the city's own consumption is only about 250,000 yuan per year, accounting for about one-tenth of the total imports and exports.</p>
<p>Shanghai Has Two Million Birds</p>
<p>The most widely raised birds in this city are the Rubies produced in Shandong, followed by the White-eyes produced in Zhejiang, and then the Larks and Thrushes produced in eastern Hebei and Liaoning. The Siskins produced in Zhejiang and the Quails produced in Shandong are also popular among the lower classes because they are good at fighting. Their numbers are also around 100,000 to 120,000 each. Every year in March and April, there are large-scale bird fighting gatherings in the City God Temple and the tea houses in the suburbs. The total number of birds currently raised in this city, combined with all categories, is about two million, and the total value is between 600,000 and 700,000 yuan. Before and after 1931, the annual turnover of the bird market was over 500,000 yuan in this city alone. In the past three or four years, due to the social and economic depression, it has gradually decreased to about 250,000 yuan. Without the support of a large amount of export trade, the so-called bird market will collapse entirely. The Shanghai bird market is concentrated in Yuwei, with a total of more than 40 large and small stores. The larger ones require a capital of about 10,000 yuan, and the smaller ones require more than 1,000 yuan. Those who engage in foreign exports must have a larger capital to be competent. The annual sales value of birdcages, an ancillary business, is also about 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Most Exported Are Warblers and Rubies</p>
<p>The total value of birds exported from this city to foreign countries every year has always been around one million yuan. The most widely sold are the Warblers produced in Zhejiang, with an annual export volume of about 3.5 million, totaling about one million yuan. The second is the Rubies, with an annual export volume of about 65,000, totaling about 100,000 yuan. The remaining White-eyes and Larks total 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. Initially, the annual export value of Mandarin ducks was also several hundred thousand yuan. Now, due to the government's strict ban on the export of poultry and Mandarin ducks, there are no exports. Most of the birds imported from foreign countries are Parrots, Cockatiels, and Rubies. Among them, Rubies are also produced in our country and are exported in large quantities. Their price is also very low, only two to six yuan per bird. However, because foreign-produced birds are of better quality, they are still imported from countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and Norway. Among them, the German species are the best, with prices ranging from fifty to sixty yuan to about two hundred yuan. However, the annual import of foreign birds is limited, not even half of our exports.</p>
<p>Organize a Syndicate to Control Foreign Sales</p>
<p>Although there are more than 40 bird dealers in this city, due to excessive business competition and most of them being short-sighted, there is still no organization to date. However, every morning, there is a discussion meeting of a conference nature in the Leyi Lou teahouse in the City God Temple. Most of the more prominent bird breeders gather in the Deyilou in the Yu Garden, and the rest gather in other teahouses. From morning to night, people carrying birds and cages gather in groups, up to dozens of people, to visit and compare each other, and to discuss and study together. The corners of the house are filled with the sounds of warbling, which is truly a grand sight. Although bird merchants can make a slight profit this year, foreign sales are entirely in the hands of foreign merchants and manipulated by them, and we have become vassals. Therefore, some enlightened bird merchants are now planning to eliminate the past state of isolation and competition with each other and jointly organize a unified syndicate to seek a way out to foreign countries. However, most bird merchants are blinded by prejudice, which has delayed its realization. At the same time, although there are many domestically produced birds, due to transportation obstacles and difficulties, birds from distant producing areas are difficult to transport to Shanghai, which is also a loss in foreign trade.</p>
<h3>Do Not Abandon Infant Corpses, Small Coffins, or Dead Infant Bundles; Send Them to the Charity Hall</h3>
<p>This Can Avoid the Trouble of Opening Coffins, Turning Corpses, and Taking Photos; They Should Be Sent Directly to the Charity Hall for Handling or Supervision</p>
<p>In the past, infant corpses, small coffins, or dead infant bundles found on roads and remote places in the French Concession were reported by officers and health officials to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch, which sent laborers to collect and bury them. Since the establishment of the Second Special Court, the French Police Department, out of caution, requires each police station to investigate the abandoned infant corpses, small coffins, and dead infant bundles found in the concession, transport them to the corpse examination center of the Tongren Fuyuan Branch, open the small coffins, take out the corpses for photos, and report to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special Court for inspection before handing them over to the hall for burial. The procedure is very complicated, mostly because the families have no way to purchase coffins or lack the ability to buy coffins, so they entrust people or send the bundles themselves to the charity hall for burial. Some rascals are greedy and lazy, abandoning the infant coffins or bundles halfway in secluded places or on the side of the road, causing the police to find them, report them to the police station, and transport them to the corpse examination center for inspection, which is troublesome. Moreover, the small coffins that have been coffined must be opened, the corpses turned over, and photos taken, which is painful. Once the weather is not right, and smallpox or seasonal diseases are prevalent, there are more than ten such abandoned small coffins or infant corpses in a single day, and the undertakers and hall laborers are overwhelmed. According to people in the charity hall, if residents in this city unfortunately have an infant death, whether in a coffin or a bundle, they can send it directly to the charity hall for burial. If they entrust someone to send it, they must also send someone to follow and supervise to avoid abandonment along the way and the trouble of reporting and opening coffins. This benefits both the living and the dead, and is a boundless act of public virtue.</p>
<h3>One of Two Apprentices Who Stole Money Apprehended</h3>
<p>Shi Jiuhua Tracked Him to Shanghai; Li Qingyang Was Detained for Investigation</p>
<p>Shi Jiuhua, a 50-year-old man from Zhenjiang, has been running the Jiuhua Lace Factory in Taohuawu, Suzhou, for many years and has accumulated a lot of savings. He hired two apprentices, Shi Hongkui and Li Qingyang, to help with the work. On the 13th of last month, while Shi was unprepared, they stole 525 yuan in national currency from the account and fled to Shanghai. The day before yesterday, Shi found out that Shi and Li were working in the Yuandong Textile Factory on Jessfield Road after arriving in Shanghai, so he made a special trip to Shanghai and reported it to the Caojiadu Police Station in charge. Upon receiving the report, the police station sent police to the scene and arrested Li Qingyang on the spot. Shi Hongkui escaped. After questioning Shi at the police station and finding him innocent, he was prepared to send a document to the General Bureau for interrogation because the case involved stealing money and fleeing privately.</p>
<h3>Did Not Know How to Drive a Car and Injured Two Children</h3>
<p>One Broke His Right Kneecap; One Broke Several Ribs</p>
<p>Gao A'er, a worker from the Yong'an Auto Repair Company on Tiantong'an Road, Zhabei, from Yangzhou, 33 years old, drove a repaired car with the license plate number 4371 from the company at around 11:00 AM yesterday. Gao was curious and drove the car onto the road. He did not know how to drive, and after driving only a few steps, he ran over two children on the side of the road, causing serious injuries. Zhou Zhenyou, a boy from Funing, 13 years old (living on a boat on Hengbang Bridge), broke his right kneecap. Another boy, Zhou Lianyun, 12 years old, from Shandong (living in a shack on Tiantong'an Road), had his chest crushed by the wheels, breaking several ribs, and his life was in danger. Gao A'er, who caused the accident, was arrested by the police officers from the Tiantong'an Road Police Station who rushed to the scene after hearing the news and taken to the station for strict handling by the police station at the Huazhan. In the meantime, the two injured children were rushed to the Tongren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Li Jinying, a Woman from Rugao, Sues for Divorce</h3>
<p>Husband Hides and Cannot Be Seen; Issue of Jurisdiction Under Study</p>
<p>Li Jinying, a woman from Rugao, is 25 years old. She married Gu Gendi, a 26-year-old glass factory worker from Taixing County, at the age of 17. Only eight months after the marriage, her husband joined the Communist Party and was wanted by the local government in his hometown, and he fled without a trace, abandoning his young wife for eight years. There has been no news. Recently, Li Jinying heard that her husband was working in Shanghai, so she also came to Shanghai and lived at No. 40 Tanqianwan, Zhabei, hoping to reunite. However, Gu hid and could not be seen. Li Jinying believed that she had mistakenly married a bandit, and if she did not find a way out, she feared that she would have no hope for lifelong happiness. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit for divorce with the Shanghai Local Court. Yesterday, Judge Cao held a court session. The defendant's address was unknown, and there was no way to summon him. The judge then stated that the issue of jurisdiction lay with Taixing County, the defendant's original county. Li Jinying stated that the defendant also had no address in Taixing and requested the court to accept the case. The judge asked if anyone could prove that the defendant had no address in Taixing. She replied that a man named Wang could testify. The court ordered a postponement to summon the witness for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Last Year's Shanghai Sugar Industry Overview</h3>
<p>Business Booming in All Sectors, Mostly Profitable</p>
<p>The sugar industry in the 25th year [1936], originally expected to improve due to abundant agricultural harvests, suffered setbacks because of rampant smuggling in North China and rumors of tax reductions on foreign sugar in May and June. Both commodity prices and sales were affected, resulting in considerable losses. Fortunately, the tax reduction was not implemented, and price fluctuations were not excessive. The maximum price differences for various sugars, such as Dutch coarse white, East white, Dutch red, and East red, were only a few dollars. Domestic Chaozhou sugar had better business opportunities. The price fluctuations of Chaozhou green and red sugar were significant, with a maximum difference of four to five dollars. Those who managed the ups and downs effectively made substantial profits. Industry insiders believed that the inventory of Chaozhou sugar was not high and feared it would be difficult to introduce new stock. Therefore, those who bought at low prices were confident and waited for good prices to sell, eventually achieving their goals. For other types, such as Diaoqing, the lowest price was less than ten yuan, and the highest reached thirteen and a half yuan. Hainan red sugar had a minimum price of ten yuan and ninety cents and a maximum of fourteen yuan and forty cents. Guangdong coarse white and local cotton white were affected by foreign sugar, so their price fluctuations were relatively small, with a maximum difference of only sixty or seventy cents. Other fancy varieties such as local ice and miscellaneous white generally yielded profits. It is said that last year, businesses like Sheng Ji and Jun Yi, which focused on domestic sugar, achieved excellent profits. Other well-funded businesses, such as Yuan Sheng, Fang Cui, He Yu, and Feng Heng, also performed well. Detailed profit and loss figures will only be revealed during the final accounting, according to old customs. For now, only a general overview can be provided. According to industry insiders, all businesses were profitable, varying only in the amount. Furthermore, bad debts from customer guilds were minimal last year, which is of utmost importance to business. In previous years, some businesses that could have been profitable suffered losses due to bad debts. This was not heard of last year, reflecting the industry's stability. The Xi'an Incident was closely related to the sugar industry. If the issue remained unresolved, the sugar industry would have inevitably suffered significant losses. Fortunately, the incident was resolved peacefully, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek safely returned to Nanjing. Any losses to the sugar industry were minimal. Moreover, as transportation in the north gradually resumed, domestic green and red sugar became active again, revitalizing the industry. Consequently, the price of Shantou sugar at the end of the year rose by sixty or seventy cents due to active buying by various guilds. Local traders, observing the frequent price drops of green sugar, mostly adopted a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in low inventory. Prices rose accordingly, and foreign sugar also showed a firm trend. It is predicted that prices will not fluctuate excessively in the near future, and the sugar market is expected to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Stealing and Selling Under the Guise of Sample Collection</h3>
<p>Petty Thieves Accumulate Small Amounts, Four Arrested for Interrogation Last Night</p>
<p>Recently, some unemployed vagrants came up with an idea of making counterfeit sample bags from Shanghai customs brokers or Hakka merchants, marked with brand names. They would infiltrate warehouses to collect samples of grains and sugars, accumulating small amounts and then selling them privately to make a living. Others would pose as dockworkers, entering warehouses to load and unload goods, seizing the opportunity to steal soft goods and conceal them under their clothes for sale. This technique is called "running horses" by these individuals. Lai Yidu, a warehouse of Hua Tong in Pudong, recently noticed frequent shortages of white and red sugars in the warehouses. Upon closer inspection of the sugar bags, they found traces of sample collection. After a secret investigation, they learned that the losses were due to these thieves. They reported to the Pudong Police Bureau, which instructed the stationed police to be vigilant. At 7 PM last night, Luo Hanxiang from Hubei, Ma Bin from Nantong, Yi Zhongxiang from Hubei, and Li Zhenlin from Nantong were arrested on the docks. They were found with two sample bags and more than ten pounds of white sugar. Both the individuals and the stolen goods were taken to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (6)</h3>
<p>Q: What are the procedures for purchasing a domestic money order?</p>
<p>A: The remitter should obtain a "Domestic Money Order Application Form," also known as a "General Money Order Form," from the postal remittance window. They should fill in the amount to be remitted, as well as the names and addresses of both the remitter and the payee. When filling it out, pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>1.  The amount of remittance: The amount should be written clearly and legibly to avoid errors.</p>
<p>2.  Return receipt required?: The post office provides a form that, along with the money order, is given to the remitter to send to the payee. The payee, when cashing the money order, will sign and stamp the form in the designated area and present it with the money order (which also needs to be signed and stamped) to the cashing post office. The cashing post office will then return the form to the remitting post office for the remitter to keep as proof that the payee has received the remittance. This form is called a "Return Receipt" and costs eight cents per form. Whether or not it is needed is up to the remitter. If needed, the remitter should indicate "Yes" in the relevant section of the "Domestic Money Order Application Form"; otherwise, indicate "No."</p>
<p>3.  The remitter's name and address: The remitter's name and address should be filled out in detail so that if the remittance is not cashed by the payee within the validity period, the remitting post office can notify the remitter to retrieve the money within a reasonable time.</p>
<p>4.  The payee's name and address: The payee's name and address should be written clearly and in detail. The name, in particular, should be accurate to ensure that the signature and stamp of the payee match the information on the form when cashing the money order, preventing delays in the cashing process.</p>
<p>5.  The cashing post office name: To facilitate the public, post offices will also have postal branches where money orders can be cashed. The remitter should indicate the postal branch closest to the payee's address where money orders can be cashed in the "Cashing Post Office Name" section of the "Domestic Money Order Application Form" to make it easier for the payee to cash the money order nearby. For example, if the payee lives in the Xiafei Road area of Shanghai, the remitter should write "Xiafei Road Branch" in the cashing post office name section. If only "Shanghai Post Office" or "Shanghai" is written, the payee will have to go to the Shanghai Postal Administration on North Sichuan Road to cash the money order.</p>
<p>After filling out the Domestic Money Order Application Form, submit it along with the remittance to the postal remittance staff. They will calculate the remittance fee. After the remittance fee is paid, the remittance staff will issue the money order and fill out a receipt (which is the lower part of the Domestic Money Order Application Form). If a return receipt is requested, it will be given to the remitter along with the money order for verification. The remitter should then seal the money order, and the return receipt, if any, in an envelope and send it by registered or express registered mail. The money order receipt should be kept safe as proof in case the money order is lost or needs to be inquired about.</p>
<p>Also, when purchasing a money order, besides obtaining the money order receipt from the post office, be sure to also take the money order and seal it in an envelope yourself. Do not just take the receipt and give the letter to the postal remittance staff to seal and mail the money order on your behalf.</p>
<h3>Fourth-Class Passenger Train Services on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter, noting public questions regarding the Beijing-Shanghai Railway's fourth-class passenger train service's restricted ticketing stations and nighttime operation, inquired with the railway bureau. According to a statement from the person in charge of the railway bureau, the issue of limited station ticketing is due to the fact that state-owned railways do not issue fourth-class tickets. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway is the only one with this service, and its intention is to meet the specific needs of the railway's environment. Some stations along the railway line are heavily affected by water transport competition, and there are many poor workers between Shanghai and Zhenjiang. To cope with competition and facilitate these workers, the railway sells fourth-class tickets. Therefore, the ticketing stations must be strictly limited to avoid exceeding the original purpose and harming national revenue. In recent years, the railway has spared no effort in renovating passenger train facilities. The cleanliness and comfort of fourth-class passenger cars are far better than before. Many third-class passengers try to take advantage by switching to fourth-class cars. If this behavior is allowed to grow, the third-class passenger service will suffer a sharp decline, affecting the overall situation. There is considerable concern about this. Therefore, the railway cannot reduce the number of designated stations for selling fourth-class tickets, nor can it increase the number of undesignated stations. Regarding the issue of nighttime operation, fourth-class passenger trains between Shanghai and Zhenjiang originally operated during the day. However, many passengers on these trains needed to cross the Yangtze River to return north after arriving in Zhenjiang. Because the train arrived in Zhenjiang at night, they could not cross the river and had to stay overnight in Zhenjiang, increasing their travel expenses. In view of this, the railway changed the departure time of the Shanghai train to after 12:00 AM, allowing passengers to arrive in Zhenjiang after dawn, enabling them to cross the river immediately, thereby reducing their expenses. Furthermore, the train does not stop at many small stations, making it equivalent to an express train. Since the change, passengers have found it convenient, and the train has become very crowded. The railway had no choice but to add the Shanghai-Wuxi 46th train, which departs later, to alleviate the situation. As for the Shanghai-Beijing 42nd train, which departs at 5:40 AM, it is a train that stops at every station along the entire route and must depart early to reach Nanjing without being too late. However, passengers on this train are not completely without sunlight throughout the day. In addition, the Wuxi-Shanghai 45th train departs at 12:10 PM, the Zhenjiang-Shanghai 43rd train departs at 9:30 AM, and the Beijing-Shanghai 41st train departs at 8:20 AM. All of these trains carry fourth-class passengers. Therefore, not all fourth-class passenger trains operate at night. The Shanghai-Beijing express departs at 11:00 PM, and the Shanghai-Beiping through train departs at 12:00 AM. Therefore, nighttime train services on this railway are not limited to fourth-class passenger trains.</p>
<h3>Number of Japanese Residents in Shanghai Decreases Compared to Previous Years</h3>
<p>According to a recent survey by the Japanese Consulate, as of the end of last year, there were a total of 6,471 Japanese households in Shanghai, totaling 23,670 people. This is a decrease of 168 households and approximately 400 people compared to the previous year (1935). Compared to the number of Japanese residents in Shanghai in 1934, there is an even greater decrease of 2,173.</p>
<h3>Cai Ning Goes to Guangdong to Inspect Educational Affairs</h3>
<p>Yu Bin Departs to Attend the World Catholic Congress</p>
<p>Archbishop Cai Ning, representative of the Roman Catholic Church, took the French postal ship "The Anger of Shah" to Hong Kong the day before yesterday morning to inspect Catholic affairs in South China. Eighteen bishops from southern, central, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces have already arrived in Hong Kong and will hold a bishop's conference there before heading to Guangdong. There, he will deliver a speech to the research class organized by the Guangdong Catholic Progress Association. He is expected to return north around the end of the month. Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing District returned to Nanjing from Shanghai the night before yesterday. Following Cai's orders, he is scheduled to come to Shanghai again today and take a ship to Guangdong to lecture at the Guangdong research class for a week. Afterwards, he will go to Manila to attend the World Catholic Congress. More than 200,000 representatives from various countries will participate in this congress. The Holy See has specially sent Cardinal Filadelfi from the United States to participate. Yu will represent China at this grand event.</p>
<h3>Gansu Relief Association Pleads for Mayor Wu's Assistance</h3>
<p>Earnestly Soliciting Donations from All Sectors to Save a Million Souls</p>
<p>The Gansu Provincial Relief Association sent a telegram to the Shanghai Municipal Government, urging all sectors to donate funds to relieve the disaster in Gansu. The telegram reads: "To Mayor Wu Jun of the Shanghai Municipal Government: Gansu Province, already impoverished, has suffered another red disaster, devastating over fifty counties and ruining millions of lives. The disaster situation is extraordinarily severe, unprecedented in ancient times. The provincial authorities, though cutting flesh to mend sores, are striving to provide relief, but their efforts are like a cup of water trying to extinguish a cartload of burning wood, insufficient to make up for even a tiny fraction of the need. Now, as the year draws to a close and the weather turns cold, freezing and starvation are rampant, and death and displacement are rampant. If generous aid is not provided, they will inevitably await death in dried-up ruts. In addition to telegraphing the central government to allocate a large sum to provide urgent assistance, we earnestly appeal to you to show great kindness, generously open your wallets, and encourage donations from all sides to save the afflicted people. Your compassion is admired by all. We make this urgent appeal, hoping for your attention. The Gansu Provincial Relief Association kowtows."</p>
<h3>Finance Bureau Will Not Extend Reduction in Pawnshop License Fees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Social Affairs and Finance Bureaus to extend the eight-percent reduction in pawnshop license fees for another two years. It is now learned that the Finance Bureau has responded to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's original letter, stating: "The request in your letter (Business Letter No. 261) on behalf of the Pawnshop Trade Association to extend the eight-percent reduction in business license fees for another two years has been reviewed. According to the petition from the Shanghai Pawnshop Trade Association, this bureau has learned that the order from the Shanghai Municipal Government to reduce pawnshop license fees by eight percent was only until the end of the 25th year and will not be extended. The request from the industry will not be considered. We hereby respond to your letter and request that you inform the members to comply with the regulations and pay the fees."</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Again Asks for Attention to Provisional Execution</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association, based on a proposal from its members, previously stated that courts were not paying attention to announcing provisional execution for illegal appeals and requested that the Ministry of Justice be petitioned to order all courts to pay attention to rigorously implementing provisional execution. Believing this to be true, the association submitted a petition to the Ministry of Justice, which responded that it could not be uniformly enforced. After further discussion, the association stated that while it was not possible to uniformly announce provisional execution for illegal appeals, the courts should pay attention to considering the circumstances and announce provisional execution for cases that should be provisionally executed to avoid delays in litigation. It is heard that the association has continued to petition the Ministry of Justice to order all levels of courts to pay attention.</p>

Upon interrogation, he identified himself as Chen Zuying, 25 years old, from Guangdong, currently living in the home of relatives at No. 2 Ren'an Lane, Jiu Mu Di, Nanshi.

<p>Notice from the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association to Members</p>
<p>The New Pharmaceutical Industry Association sent a letter to its members yesterday, stating that it is no longer necessary to fill out licenses when transporting goods to other locations. The letter read: "Regarding the matter of exempting drugs from inspection to alleviate commercial difficulties, this association previously sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Ministry of Finance. We have now received approval from the Ministry of Finance, document number Guan Zi 11630, stating: 'Having reviewed the Chamber of Commerce's request to temporarily exempt drugs from inspection to alleviate commercial difficulties, this ministry, considering the circumstances of drug transportation and sales, notes that the majority of drugs are legally imported. It is inappropriate to delay the legitimate transportation of goods due to a small number of smuggled items, which would be detrimental to public health. Therefore, this ministry has temporarily exempted drugs from inspection and will monitor the situation. If necessary, further remedies will be considered. The aforementioned matter has been approved for implementation. You are hereby notified.' Therefore, as this matter was previously requested by the industry association and forwarded for exemption from drug inspection, it has been approved.

<h3>Solicitation of Articles for the Completion of Mr. Wan Jiye's Ancestral Hall and Tomb</h3>
<p>Mr. Wan, whose name was Sitong, courtesy name Jiye, sobriquet Shiyuan, and posthumous title Zhenwen, was from Guanjiagans of Yin at the end of the Ming Dynasty. His family was known to the world for their four loyalists, three paragons of virtue, and one righteous person. His father, Tai, was the ancestor of Siming literature and taught the classics and history to his sons, allowing them to study with Huang Lizhou, each becoming famous in their own right, and Mr. Wan was the most outstanding among them. His brother, Sida, buried Zhang Cangshui's remains at Nanping. Mr. Wan was exceptionally intelligent, read widely, was well-versed in history, and wrote prolifically. He cultivated his reputation and was indifferent to fame and fortune. He did not accept the position of erudite scholar in the Qing Dynasty, but lamented the fall of his motherland and the imminent loss of literature. He participated in the Bureau of Compilation as a commoner for over twenty years, personally editing the Draft History of the Ming Dynasty in five hundred volumes, creating a special case for historical revision and initiating the Zhejiang school of history. Later generations who read his works not only understood the gradual decline of the Ming Dynasty due to foreign invasions but also spontaneously felt a sense of patriotism. He awakened the deaf and restored China through his writings. Mr. Wan promoted the national spirit through his writings, and his contribution was immense. His tomb is located on the hillside of Aoniaoyangguan in Chunhu West Zhongyi District, Fenghua. His descendants are scattered, and offerings have long been neglected. During the Tongzhi period of the Qing Dynasty, Xie Wufeng Si Gongsong first found it among the wilderness. There was a tombstone inscribed by Grand Secretary Wang Xuling, "Tomb of the Confucian Scholar Wan Jiye of Yin who Exemplified Learning," and a couplet by Hanlin Qiu Lian, "A pen of Ban and Ma, a commoner of Heaven and Earth." En Gong pitied its desolation and lack of inheritance, and invited Wu Kezhou Xun Dao of the same village and Liu Yutang Xun Dao Shao Cong and others, seven or eight people in total, to take turns making sacrifices and sweeping the tomb during Qingming. They once planned to raise funds to purchase sacrificial fields but were unsuccessful. After the death of these gentlemen, the sacrificial offerings ceased, and only the Xie family still maintained the intention. The year before last, the Yin people of the Nanlei Society initiated the restoration of the Baiyun Villa, the ancestral home of the Wan family. Now, the central government honors the sages of the past and has listed Mr. Wan as a local worthy. However, his tomb is located in a remote mountain village and is gradually being forgotten. Xie Engong's disciple, Ying Zhaosong, was concerned about this and urgently planned to repair the tomb to settle his spirit and build an ancestral hall to perpetuate his worship. He gathered fellow villagers from the former Ningbo prefecture and initiated the project, receiving support from famous figures in the country. Construction began in May of this year (the twenty-fifth year) and has now been successfully completed. The process of repairing the tomb and building the ancestral hall is briefly described below, so that learned gentlemen can gain some insight. I have always known that Mr. Wan devoted his energy to writing and created works to benefit the world, and I dare to respectfully offer this communication to seek his peaceful rest. As this matter concerns the commemoration of a wise man, I hope you will not hesitate to contribute your valuable insights.</p>
<p>㊀ Purchase of Land</p>
<p>Wan's tomb is located on the southern foothills of Aoniaoyangguan in Chunhu, Fenghua. The original area was quite narrow and insufficient to commemorate a local worthy. A considerable amount of mountain land has now been purchased around the left, right, and rear of the tomb, extending about three to four or six to seven zhang from the walls. Fourteen fields, totaling eight mu and one fen, were purchased in front of the tomb. In this way, there is considerable open space around the tomb, which can be used to set up altars and plant trees, enhancing the view. The ancestral hall is located at the Dongqiao Bridge in the north of Chunhu Town, with a total area of one mu and five fen, about fifteen zhang long from east to west and about ten zhang long from north to south. It is adjacent to Chunhu Elementary School, with a garden to the south and facing the stream. The surrounding mountains, including Jiufeng, Datong, Jin'e, and Chunhu Ao, encircle the four sides and can be seen from near and far.</p>
<p>㊁ Construction Project</p>
<p>The planned project for Wan's tomb included raising the tombstone, repairing the tomb enclosure, leveling the open space in front of the tomb, building a tomb passage archway, building roads, building bridges where there were streams, and building stone retaining walls where there were slopes. All of these were contracted out and completed in stages and have now been completed. The tombstone has been raised by one chi, and the inscriptions and couplets have been completely refreshed. What was once only found by feeling is now clearly visible. The ground in front of the tomb has been leveled with cement, with a width of four zhang and a depth of four zhang. A sacrificial table and two stone benches have been set up, also made of cement. Forty-odd zhang in front of the tomb, a cement archway has been built in a twenty-character shape, with a height of two zhang and four chi and a width of one zhang and one chi. The front is inscribed with the nine large characters "Tomb Passage of Local Worthy Wan Jiye" by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the rear is inscribed with the four characters "Noble Virtue and Integrity" by Chairman Lin. The four sides of the archway pillars are engraved with couplets by Zhuang Songfu, Chen Zhuo, Shen Changyou, Ying Zhaosong, and others. Zhuang's couplet reads, "The historical pen is worth a thousand troops, the teacher is immortal; a commoner for his whole life, later generations admire his grace." Chen's couplet reads, "His generation's writings remain in history, his offerings will last for a thousand years on famous mountains." Shen's couplet reads, "His writings hang in the universe, his integrity strengthens the lakes and mountains." Ying's couplet reads, "The teacher's tomb is close by, clearing the weeds; a heart of incense offering to the righteous history; the ancestral mounds stand tall, modeling the mountains and waters; a thousand years of offerings, admiring the fragrant spirit." "Teacher's tomb" refers to Xie Engong's tomb on the right mountain, and Ying's ancestral mounds are on the front mountain, hence the couplet. On the side of the road, a cement memorial arch has been erected, nine chi high, with the five large characters "Wan Township Kidney Tomb Road" engraved on the east, west, and south sides to indicate the location of the tomb. The circumference of the ancestral hall is seven zhang wide and nine zhang deep, divided into two courtyards, front and rear. The front courtyard has a gate in the middle, with side rooms on the left and right. There is open space in front, with tung and willow trees planted along the stream and holly trees planted along the roadside. Between the front and rear courtyards, there are several zhang of paved ground, planted with osmanthus trees in the middle and peach and plum trees in the surrounding gardens. The ground is covered with grass, and the scenery is quite secluded. The rear three rooms are the main hall, with the middle room being one zhang and seven chi wide and the side rooms being one zhang and five chi wide each. The height is two zhang and two chi, and the depth is one chi greater than the height. The three rooms are the same. Inside are the plaques "National Model" by Chairman Lin, "Noble Aspiration and Action" by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and "Seeking Aspiration and Achieving Dao" by Zhuang Songfu. There are couplets between the pillars by Chen Zhuo, Zhao Cisheng, Ying Zhaosong, Zhou Chu, Shen Changyou, and Sun Yizhi. Chen's couplet reads, "His historical pen flows through the ages, his writings ascend to the ranks of the left and right; a model to admire, his thousand-year integrity alongside Liu and Huang." Zhao's couplet reads, "Holding the pen like strict frost, a word of praise or condemnation, the historical talent of Ban and Ma establishes a tripod; abandoning office like discarding worn-out shoes, a life of simplicity, the Taoist learning of Liu and Huang is passed down." Ying's couplet reads, "His writings are on famous mountains, feeding on Yan Xi's righteousness, his attire and crown remain in the old country, his integrity is strong and high." Zhou's couplet reads, "The tripod shifts and the society changes, where to serve the country, documents await searching, only caring for the commoner to participate in the history bureau; the ancient tomb and new ancestral hall, the residing spirit finds its place, fragrant incense is offered forever, looking up to the portrait, worshiping the Confucian master." Shen's couplet reads, "Grieving for the separation from the old country, the affairs are true and the words are clear, the historical lineage can be inherited by Ban and Ma; shamed to eat the millet of foreign lands, his conduct is pure and his aspirations are bitter, his integrity is comparable to Yi Qi." Sun's couplet reads, "The rise and fall of the country are tied together, a generation's history preserves national righteousness; the new atmosphere of the lakes and mountains, a thousand years of people worship the commoner's honor." The three characters "Local Worthy Shrine" outside the main gate were written by Chen Qicai, the Director of the National Government's Accounting Office. The ancestral hall and tomb projects have all been completed.</p>
<p>㊂ Management Method</p>
<p>It is planned to set up twenty-odd mu of fields and establish a Management Committee for Mr. Wan Jiye's Ancestral Hall and Tomb. The income from the fields will be used for the expenses of sacrifice and repair. Every year on April 1st, the Management Committee will join with all the teachers and students of Chunhu Elementary School to make sacrifices and sweep the ancestral hall and tomb. On the same day, a meeting will be held to discuss matters and report on income and expenditure accounts.</p>
<p>Please send your works to our office on the third floor of the Ningbo Zhejiang East Bank by February. Launched by the Construction Office of Mr. Wan Jiye's Ancestral Hall and Tomb</p>

<h3>Ideal Team Wins by a Narrow Margin in the First Inter-Port Football Trial</h3>
<p>Wins 5-3, Barely Defeating the Royal Ulster Rifles, Trailing 1-2 in the First Half</p>
<p>In the inter-port football trial match, the Ideal team played its first trial match against the Royal Ulster Rifles (RUR) from Shanghai yesterday at the Shenyuan Grounds. Due to the absence of center back Ma Shan'er, Bocchis of the French Chamber was selected to fill his place, resulting in many loopholes. The RUR had a strong momentum, taking a 2-0 lead within ten minutes. The first half ended with the RUR leading 2-1. The Ideal team relied on their efforts in the second half to win 5-3 by a narrow margin. Although there was a line of cars in front of the Shenyuan Grounds yesterday, only two-thirds of the one-dollar seats were filled, and the half-dollar seats were even more sparse, totaling less than 2,000 people. The battle situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Royal Ulster Rifles Take the Lead</p>
<p>After choosing sides, the Ideal team had the advantage of the sun at their backs and the right to kick off. The Shenyuan field was still muddy yesterday, making it difficult for both sides to control the ball after the start. The RUR seized the opportunity to advance, advancing on the left. Bocchis stumbled, and Bao Saizhong fell to the ground, unable to get up, in a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, Feng Yunyou arrived in time to send the ball out for a corner kick, avoiding disaster. The Ideal team counterattacked, with a pass from Little Walter reaching the goal, but narrowly missing success. At the five-minute mark, Prome of the RUR went deep, passed to the left wing, and Creighton crossed the ball. Bocchis stepped on it, unexpectedly turning it into an own goal, gifting the first goal. The inter-port wings launched very active counterattacks, but without progress. At the ten-minute mark, Zha Xu dribbled the ball poorly, and it was intercepted midway. The entire RUR team attacked, and Summer shot. Bao Saizhong fumbled the ball out, and the two defenders stood there blankly, allowing Morris to tap the ball into the empty net. The Ideal team conceded two goals within ten minutes. They counterattacked aggressively, and Robertson got a chance to shoot, hitting the goalpost and bouncing back onto the goal line. McNally re-kicked it out, but it was ruled invalid, resulting in a fruitless effort. Stalemated until the twenty-fifth minute, James Walter crossed the ball from the baseline, hitting the right post and the goalkeeper's body. Sun Jinshun rushed in and deflected the ball, penetrating the bottom of the net, making it 1-2. After that, the Ideal team had several shots on goal. Once, Tuile opened a corner kick, landing right in front of the goal, but the goalkeeper was not in position, and Yaz used his body to stop it, and Creighton cleared the danger. Once, Tuile crossed the ball, and Little Walter left the goal open, but Sun Jinshun's flat shot was sharp and fast, but it was caught by McNally. The first half passed with this score, with the RUR leading 2-1.</p>
<p>Ideal Team Wins</p>
<p>After the restart, the Ideal team immediately progressed from the right. The initial attempt failed, but after just one minute, Greenberg advanced sharply and passed far to the center. Sun Jinshun, fifteen yards from the goal, bent down and hooked the ball, and the RUR goalkeeper was on the left, so the ball grazed the ground and entered the right corner of the net. The Ideal team tied the score at 2-2. The RUR counterattacked, and Creighton crossed the ball. Feng jumped up and headed it out, but the ball was intercepted by Chambers, who immediately shot, landing on the side of the left post. Bao Saizhong slapped it out with both hands, fortunately avoiding a disaster, extremely dangerous. The Ideal team's offense intensified, but Walter's shot went wide. Zha Xu received help from Zhen He and shot from 30 yards away. Although the kick was strong, it missed by a mile. At the fifteen-minute mark, Little Walter passed far, and Greenberg intercepted the ball under the goal and kicked it in, giving the Ideal team a 3-2 lead. However, after the kickoff from the center line, the RUR had swept over, with two forwards attacking in the center. Morris shot, but the ball was very slow, and Bao Saizhong came out to meet it, but was too careless and stumbled. The ball hovered on the goal line, and Morris rushed up and tapped it in, tying the score again at 3-3, just one minute after the previous goal. After that, the RUR became vigorous again, and the Ideal team's area was frequently in danger. After a long stalemate, they finally escaped the predicament. Robertson advanced to the opponent's goal, but lacked support and missed a good opportunity. Fortunately, shortly after, Greenberg charged in, and McNally came out to meet him, leaving the goal empty, and Greenberg tapped the ball into the empty net, giving the Ideal team a 4-3 lead again. The RUR left-back Faleman was also injured while blocking Greenberg's ball. After that, the RUR's attack was very fierce, but fortunately, two minutes before the end, Robertson went deep alone and, taking advantage of the two defenders coming out to meet him, kicked hard, bouncing off the top of the net and into the corner of the net. Shortly after, the whistle blew, and the Ideal team won 5-3 by a narrow margin.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Zilin Cup semi-finals saw Yu You and Aurora, who had tied in the Group B league, meet at Jiaozhou Park. Yu You had a strong momentum. After about a quarter of an hour, left-winger Ge Xizhuo opened the scoring. Then, left-winger Shen Shiqi scored from a penalty kick, taking a 2-0 lead in the first half. After the restart, left-winger Shen Baigui scored another goal. After that, Yu You had many opportunities, while Aurora's offense was also strong, with its forwards advancing very quickly. However, Yu You's defense was effective, and they were not taken advantage of, so they eliminated Aurora 3-0. In another Zilin Cup semi-final, the Russian team played against the Surveying team, still held at Hongkou Park. The Russian team ranked first in the Group B league, while the Surveying team was unknown. Before the game, it was predicted that the Surveying team would not be able to withstand the Russian team's attack. However, the result of the game was that the Russian team was too careless and was defeated by the Surveying team 4-1. In the final week, Yu You and the Surveying team will compete for the championship. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<h3>Jindes Primary Advances to the Finals of the Junior Cup</h3>
<p>Eliminating Aurora Savaria</p>
<p>The Junior Cup football, like the Zilin Cup, held its semi-finals yesterday. Those who met were Aurora and Jinde from the Morning League, and Savaria and Junior from Group C. As a result of the game, Jinde, although encountering a strong opponent, was able to cope calmly with a higher skill, winning four goals in the first half and making it four to two in the second half. The overall result was to eliminate Aurora with eight to two and gain the right to the final. Another group, Savaria, although winning six consecutive victories and ranking first in the Group C league, was surprisingly eliminated by the Junior Association, which had suffered four defeats, with six to four. Jinde will compete with the Junior Association for the Junior Cup championship in the final week. Although Junior is one level higher, Jinde is full of strength, and it is feared that Junior will find it difficult to touch its edge. The Jinde lineup yesterday was as follows</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Financial Situation Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Wei Youfei</p>
<p>(1) General Financial Market Conditions for the Year</p>
<p>Observing the economic surface phenomena of the entire country, if we consider the 24th year of the Republic [1935] as a period of panic outbreak, then undoubtedly, the national economy in the 25th year [1936] has shown a slight upturn from the period of economic depression. This situation can be seen from the financial market conditions in Shanghai over the past year. During this year, the rise and fall of financial institutions were very rare; interbank lending rates remained stable and relaxed throughout the year. Industrial and commercial activity saw a turnaround compared to the previous year, but was not particularly prosperous. In short, all financial dynamics throughout the year were in a state of flatness, and both the supply and demand of finance were sluggish.</p>
<p>Before describing Shanghai's financial market conditions over the past year, I will first introduce the economic changes within the country.</p>
<p>In terms of finance, following the New Currency Decree, in February of the 25th year, the authorities announced a plan to consolidate government bonds, which involved issuing unified government bonds worth 1.46 billion yuan to redeem previously issued domestic government bonds and treasury bills; and separately issuing reconstruction government bonds worth 34 million yuan to strengthen the financial foundation and balance national treasury revenues and expenditures. The total amount was 1.8 billion yuan, with an annual interest rate of 6%, issued successively on February 1st and March 1st. The issuance of this huge amount of government bonds was unprecedented in the history of Chinese government bonds. Consolidating many uneven government bonds under a unified name was also an unprecedented move in government bond history. At the end of June, the national budget for the 25th year was announced, along with the declaration that emphasis would be placed on the collection of direct taxes. In August, the Income Tax Regulations were promulgated and implemented starting January of the 26th year [1937]. In addition, direct taxes such as inheritance tax were being prepared for collection.</p>
<p>In terms of currency, two agreements were established, both confirmed by foreign news reports. One was the Sino-American Silver Agreement in May. Although the content of the agreement was not officially announced, based on information gathered from various sources, it was roughly that the United States would purchase 50 million to 70 million ounces of silver from China, and the proceeds would be deposited in the United States as China's foreign exchange stabilization fund. The other was the Sino-British Credit Loan Agreement in October. Its content was also not officially announced. Initial rumors suggested that Britain would lend China £5 million to £10 million to promote trade between the two countries and stabilize exchange rates. At that time, when China's diplomacy was tense, the establishment of the Sino-British loan gave major jealousy and attention to all related countries. In the end, it was announced that it was only a type of export credit lending, but undoubtedly it had considerable power in stabilizing China's exchange rate against the British pound. Summarizing these two agreements, the former can be said to be China's exchange fund in the United States, and the latter is China's exchange fund in the United Kingdom, both providing a stable foundation for the new currency system.</p>
<p>In terms of the general economy, it is especially noteworthy that the smuggling situation in North China expanded. After April and May of the 25th year, smuggling became even more severe. Not only was the tax revenue of North China greatly affected, but the expansion of smuggling areas also affected the tax revenue of the whole country. The dumping of smuggled goods posed a major threat to national industries. The textile industry in the Tianjin area, which was slightly larger in scale, was almost entirely annexed by foreign capital, partly due to the benefit of smuggling.</p>
<p>In the first month of this year, international trade once showed a surplus, breaking the new record of 50 years of trade history, but the numbers were very small. This year's national crops, such as rice, wheat, and cotton, were fortunately all harvested abundantly. The prices of agricultural products were also still stable due to overseas demand, so the rural economy was more active than the previous year.</p>
<p>In March, the Shanghai Bills Clearing House was established, and in August, the currency consolidation of Guangdong Province was completed. These were all important measures in the national finance this year.</p>
<p>Because the national economy showed calmness, but at its core, all the panic factors had not yet been completely eliminated, the Shanghai financial market showed a phenomenon of sluggishness throughout the year. After autumn, although part of it was driven by the slightly active rural economy, the reflection on finance was still very subtle, only adding a few opportunities for future growth. Because the most important element of the revival of urban finance in China is the increase in rural demand for commodities, which in turn restores the industrial and commercial credit system and increases the active power of finance. However, after this panic, whether in planning or strength, industry, commerce and finance did not dare to expand the scope excessively, so even if rural purchasing power gradually recovered, the superficial prosperity of finance was still very far away.</p>
<p>Due to habitual relations, the financial season of previous years still could not escape the state of ending every three months of the lunar calendar, but this year it was unexpectedly invisible. This is because the financial demand relationship and the environment created its long-term stagnation, and all superficial forms seem to be very stable.</p>
<p>From January to March this quarter, late January was exactly the end of the 24th year. Because of the implementation of the new currency system, the panic of lack of chips was eliminated, so the end of the 24th year, which was expected to be very unsafe, finally passed very safely. The amount of banknotes issued increased from 400 million yuan in October of the previous year to 800 million yuan (including the number of miscellaneous banknotes exchanged), which shows the general need. February is the first month of the lunar calendar, which is a very leisurely month. In March, interbank lending rates were slightly more active, but financial institutions still advocated contraction for this year's lending. After the announcement of the government bond consolidation plan, the price of government bonds fell due to the reduction in subsequent government bond yields. The reserve of silver decreased compared to previous years due to shipment abroad. Since October of last year, overseas silver prices have remained at around 20 pence. According to general observation, it is probably because the United States is unwilling to buy silver in London, so as to prevent China from completely selling silver and becoming a non-silver-using country, or even joining the sterling bloc. Because if the price of silver falls, it will be more expensive for China to sell silver and exchange it for pounds. Here, the announcement of the establishment of the Sino-American Silver Agreement can already be seen.</p>
<p>In March, the Shanghai Bank Bills Clearing House was established, increasing credit chips in the financial market, which will naturally promote the discounting business. The Farmers Bank of China was also ordered by the Ministry of Finance to issue 100 million yuan in banknotes and invest 50 million yuan in rural areas.</p>
<p>April is the small end of industrial and commercial long-term lending, and the market situation is still very stable. Interbank lending rates were slightly more active at the beginning of the month, but in general they were very stable, which is incomparable to the high level of the same period in previous years. After the establishment of the Sino-American Silver Agreement in May, the world silver market became stable again, and China's foreign debt also rose in the overseas market. In June, due to the gradual expansion of smuggling in North China, the entire foreign exchange was affected; and the news of changes in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces caused the market prices of domestic and foreign government bonds to fall. Silver continued to be shipped out, and although the reserve decreased, because silver in the country is only used as a legal currency reserve, it does not have a direct impact on the market's chips. However, silver from other ports continued to be shipped in. This quarter is the time when spring cocoons enter the market, and the three banks of the Central Bank of China, the Republic of China, and the Bank of Communications jointly sponsored a lending syndicate of 30 million yuan. A total of 19 banks and one native bank participated.</p>
<p>After July, due to the good harvest in rural areas and the promotion of sales of various goods, the market situation showed a slight activity, but the real estate business still maintained the sluggish situation of the past few years without any improvement. Although Shanghai's silver reserves were imported, more were exported to the United States for use as foreign exchange stabilization funds. After the situation in Guangdong was stabilized, the authorities re-announced the plan to reform the Guangdong currency, and from then on, Guangdong Haoyang was also on the unified road. At the end of September, France abandoned the gold standard, and the price of gold in Shanghai once rose to more than 1,160 yuan, which was the new high price after the currency reform.</p>
<p>From October to December, October was again the end of long-term lending, but because of the lack of transactions and the abundant harvest of crops, the market appeared to be abundant, and there was no longer the tension of previous years. After the news of the Sino-British loan agreement came, the general public was more optimistic about the future of China's commercial finance. The prices of goods in Shanghai have been rising day by day since October, and the upward trend has been even more severe after November. Yarn, cotton, rice, wheat, and wool fabrics have seen even more amazing increases. After December, prices were even more active. The price of yarn once rose to 268 yuan, which was the new high price since the yarn market. In mid-December, due to the Xi'an Incident, the market situation had a tense reaction, but the process was still good.</p>
<p>In short, the financial market situation during this year was loose throughout the year. The reason is, on the one hand, that the increase in chips after the currency reform eliminated the phenomenon of currency tightening. On the other hand, due to the undeveloped industry, the need for finance is extremely idle. The promotion of farmers' purchasing power, although it is one of the reasons for the rise in prices, it is obvious that it exceeds the component of purchasing power expansion, and it cannot be said to be a scene of economic recovery. Therefore, the revival of the financial market situation is not something that can be seen in a short period of time. The following is the interbank lending rate situation throughout the year: (unit points)</p>
<p>(2) Legal Tender Issuance, Exchange Rates, and Prices</p>
<p>Due to Shanghai's special importance in the country, the amount of legal tender issued by Shanghai banks can clearly show the state of most chip activities. Here, I will first introduce the process of legal tender issuance, exchange rates, and prices over the past year:</p>
<p>Legal Tender Issuance, Exchange Rates, and Price Indices Over the Past Year</p>
<p>The above legal tender issuance amount, the customs gold is outside, the issuing banks include the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, four banks, Siming Bank, Commercial Bank, Kenye Bank, China Farmers' and Workers' Bank, and the Farmers Bank of China. The date used is the last inspection report of each month.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the table, the amount of legal tender issued is increasing month by month, from January to December, it probably increased to about 45%. However, this number cannot be used as an absolute standard, because since the currency reform, the silver in the hands of the people has been gradually recovered by the central bank, then the amount of banknotes issued will naturally increase. Therefore, since there is no way to grasp how much circulation there was before the currency reform, there is no way to judge how much it has increased to date.</p>
<p>From the external price of currency (foreign exchange) and the internal price (prices), a trend of gradual decline and gradual rise can be seen, but the degree of price rise is greater than the fall in exchange rates. The above is the overall foreign exchange index. If we separate the foreign exchange situation of each country, then the exchange rate of the British pound is particularly stable throughout the year. Why is the price rise more severe than the foreign exchange rate fall? It can be clearly said that it is the result of the latter being managed by the authorities, and in fact the buying and selling of foreign exchange is slightly added or subtracted from the listing price.</p>
<p>The price index cited here is only the wholesale price index. Its ups and downs are relatively slow. If we separate each major commodity, then the upward trend of prices is even more obvious. The process of price increase this year can probably be divided into two phases? One phase is the first quarter of the first half of the year in April, and the second half of the year is after October. And the upward trend of the latter period has caused significant attention and impact in the business community. In general, industry and commerce have indeed shown a few signs of activity due to rising prices. However, because the price increase is not entirely for real needs; and industrial and commercial activities are extremely weak after a long period of hardship, so from the perspective of weighing the pros and cons, it seems that the bad influence is greater than the good influence, not to mention that prices are still rising? What is cited here are the four standard commodities in Shanghai: yarn, cotton, flour, and wheat:</p>
<p>Table of Yarn, Cotton, Flour, and Wheat Prices Over the Past Year (Unit: Yuan)</p>
<p>The upward trend shown here is different from the upward trend of wholesale prices, that is, it has been rising steadily from beginning to end. Taking cotton yarn as an example, in previous years, the price of bitter yarn was too low and the price of cotton was too high, making yarn mills unprofitable; this year, not only was the price of cotton not low, but the price of yarn also had an amazing increase. In mid-December, the price of yarn also created a new peak at any time, combining the price of cotton into the price of yarn, not only not losing money, but also making a profit. As for flour and wheat, they also show new high prices that have not been seen in previous years, and they are still rising.</p>
<p>The special upward trend of prices can be divided into several aspects. The first is naturally due to needs. If the needs are great, the price will naturally rise; but the needs mentioned here cannot point out real consumption needs or artificial needs (speculation and hoarding). The second is due to production. The production of cotton has risen due to the reduction in the harvest of American cotton, and wheat has risen due to increased exports. In addition, factors such as the world supply and demand situation and the stimulus of legal tender naturally also account for a considerable part.</p>
<p>After the sudden outbreak of the Xi'an Incident, prices changed dramatically. Due to people's panic, the state of capital flight was particularly obvious. The price of gold rushed out of the 1,170 yuan mark, and about 10 million yuan was used to purchase British and American foreign exchange. Flour, wheat, yarn, cotton, and food all rose sharply. Under the strict management of the authorities, foreign exchange was still able to maintain stability, but the reaction of prices was unstoppable.</p>
<p>Looking at the issuance amount over the past year, it is expanding, foreign exchange is stable, and prices are rising. Although the price increase has the possibility of stimulating industrial and commercial prosperity; but in fact, China's economy as a whole is still extremely weak, and the increase in purchasing power is minimal; although prices can rise due to needs, the extreme price increase can reduce needs. Therefore, the current high prices of flour, wheat, yarn, and cotton, as well as the high prices of other goods, cannot be considered a normal result, so I hope that the authorities will have the necessary management.</p>
<p>(3) Important Commodities and Import and Export Trade</p>
<p>Shanghai also occupies a leading position in the country's international trade. The trade volume of Shanghai port often accounts for 50% to 60% of the trade volume. This is because Shanghai has special convenience in national transportation. Therefore, whether it is import or export, it must be collected in Shanghai. From the situation of Shanghai's import and export trade, we can know the prototype of the national trade situation. The honor and disgrace of various important commodities can also be regarded as the prototype of the honor and disgrace of general commodities in the country. Now, I will first introduce the situation of the whole year's commodities, and then introduce the situation of the whole year's import and export trade in Shanghai port:</p>
<p>(1) Silk The silk price for the whole year was better in the first half of the year than in the second half of the year. Although the export volume of silk this year was less than last year, the value was more, due to the rise in silk prices. In January, the highest price of high-end factories reached 915 yuan, which was the highest price since 19 years [1930]. The countries with the most exports are the United States, India, and Japan. In the domestic silk market, the Jiangzhe area is more active due to the support of farmer loans and the higher silk prices, but the output for the whole year is not much.</p>
<p>(2) Tea The price of tea for the whole year was higher between June and July. The average price of Qimen (black tea) rose to 197 yuan in May, and the average price of Zhenmei (green tea) rose to 37 yuan in July, which was the high price in recent years. The output was also more than last year. However, the amount of exports was more silent than in previous years. Morocco is the first country to export to, and Russia is the second.</p>
<p>(3) Cotton This year, China's cotton production had a bumper harvest. According to the latest estimate, it was more than 14 million dans, which was 6 million dans more than last year, which was the highest number in recent years. The price of cotton was smaller in the first half of the year and better in the second half of the year, which was higher than in previous years. Imports decreased and exports increased throughout the year. Japan is the first place for exports.</p>
<p>(4) Cotton Yarn The price of yarn this year was better in the second half of the year than in the first half of the year, so yarn mills were able to profit in the second half of the year. The highest price of yarn was 268 yuan, which was the highest price since the market. The production volume this year was very small, and the high price of the market was mostly due to the situation. The total output was slightly less than in previous years.</p>
<p>(5) Rice and Wheat The country had a bumper harvest this year. According to reports, Anhui had a 14% harvest, Jiangxi also had a 14% harvest, and Hubei had a 10% harvest, which was more than 30% more than 21 and 22 years. Wheat production increased by 17% compared to last year, barley increased by 8%, and the harvests of soybeans and wheat were also called bumper harvests. The market price of rice and wheat was higher than in previous years, especially in the second half of the year. Imports of rice and wheat decreased and exports increased throughout the year.</p>
<p>In short, the output of various commodities increased this year compared to last year, and the market price also increased compared to last year, and the trend of sharp increase in the second half of the year was even more intensified. Therefore, hoarding merchants were able to profit.</p>
<p>As for the trade situation of Shanghai port over the past year, the list is as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Import and Export Trade Volume Over the Past Year (Unit: Thousand Yuan)</p>
<p>Summarizing the trade situation for 11 months, both import and export situations increased compared to last year, and the months of increase were slightly higher in the period of April and May and the period of August and September. The highest amount of exports was in August, and the highest amount of imports was in May, and the month with the largest trade deficit was April. According to the situation in previous years, April, May, August, and September are the peak seasons for import and export. Because on the one hand, there are exports of silk, tea, rice, and grains, which can be exchanged for many foreign goods. The trade surplus in January was the only situation in 50 years, which once caused great attention from scholars across the country. Now, after analyzing the past facts, the reason for the trade surplus is due to the slight increase in exports and the extreme decrease in imports, which is a coincidence and does not have a significant impact on the entire international trade.</p>
<p>Exports have increased more and imports have decreased more over the past year, but if converted into gold prices, the change is very small. Another noteworthy fact is that smuggling is still very serious. Although Shanghai is not a famous smuggling port, the active smuggling can naturally reduce the regular needs, thus reducing Shanghai's imports. (According to the Jianghai Customs, the total revenue for the whole year decreased by 258,000 yuan compared to 24 years) Another worrying thing is that the crops had a bumper harvest this year and the prices were very stable, then the purchasing power of farmers can naturally be slightly increased. Historical facts tell us that the so-called increase in purchasing power often refers to the increase in the ability to purchase imported goods. The active import business can promote the active commercial transactions between urban and rural areas. Therefore, the problem of future trade deficits is a big problem.</p>
<p>(4) The Rise and Fall of Finance and Commerce</p>
<p>The financial business this year is much more stable than last year, and it shows stability in the same way as the financial market situation. There is a saying that the Central Bank has been changed to the Central Reserve Bank, and the following eight regulations have been established: (1) Central Reserve Bank, (2) Exchange Bank, (3) Industrial Bank, (4) Trust Bank, (5) Real Estate Mortgage Bank, (6) Savings Bank, (7) Agricultural Bank, (8) Industrial Bank. The development of the banking business shows more sharpness. From these eight banking regulations, it can be seen that the concentration of banking power in the future is more expected. In fact, the capital and deposits of banks this year have a tendency to concentrate in state-owned banks.</p>
<p>The new financial institutions established this year are:</p>
<p>(1) Central Savings Association, belonging to the Central Trust Bureau, opened in March.</p>
<p>(2) Shengda Trust Company, with a capital of 1 million yuan, opened in July.</p>
<p>(3) Guangdong Bank resumed business in December.</p>
<p>The financial institutions that stopped operating are:</p>
<p>(1) Tongyi Trust Company, (2) Meihua Bank, (3) Hua'an Bank, (4) Guotai Bank.</p>
<p>The financial institutions that increased capital and reorganized are:</p>
<p>(1) Zhizhong Bank increased capital by 500,000 yuan, (2) Silk Industry Bank, jointly operated with Jiangsu Bank, (3) Siming Bank increased capital, (4) China Exchange Jiangsu and Zhejiang Banks merged.</p>
<p>The bank money houses loans of more than one million yuan established this year include (1) Electric Administration Government Bonds mortgage loans 6 million yuan, (2) Zhejiang-Jiangxi Nanping section loans 10 million yuan, (3) Jiangsu-Zhejiang spring cocoon loans 30 million yuan, (4) Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou road loans 2 million yuan, (5) Zhejiang Silk Control Association loans 5 million yuan, (6) Zhejiang Provincial Government loans 4 million yuan, (7) Ministry of Railways loans 3 million yuan, (8) Hunan Provincial loans 1.4 million yuan, (9) Guangdong Provincial loans 8 million yuan, (10) Hunan Rice Mortgage Bank Group 10 million yuan, etc.</p>
<p>The general business situation is generally carried out in the following ways: (1) Individuals tend to carry out in groups, (2) The scope of business advocates shrinking, (3) The goal of operation is cautious. Therefore, the establishment of large loans is more than small loans, and political loans jointly operated by state-owned banks are more than small industrial and commercial loans.</p>
<p>The general industrial and commercial situation is also slightly improved compared to the 24th year. Now, I will introduce the reports from the China Credit Investigation Institute and various parties, then the number of industrial and commercial bankruptcies in the current year for nine months is roughly as follows: (Before April, according to the Monthly Economic Statistics, after May, according to the China Credit Investigation Institute.)</p>
<p>Number of Industrial and Commercial Closures in Shanghai</p>
<p>23rd year 510 5th month of 25th year 36</p>
<p>24th year 1,065 6th month 78</p>
<p>1st month of 25th year 108 7th month 71</p>
<p>2nd month 74 8th month 58</p>
<p>3rd month 19 9th month 59</p>
<p>4th month 25 Total of 2,103 in three years</p>
<p>According to the observations on the numbers, the number of industrial and commercial bankruptcies is much less than last year. However, after June, the number of bankruptcies suddenly increased. The China Credit Investigation Institute studied the reasons for this and said that "although the number of new creations is considerable; however, the number of bankruptcies will double, and there are even more who have reorganized or liquidated their businesses in less than three or four months, because the purchasing power of the market has not increased, and the turnover of finance is still stagnant." According to the survey, the number of new industrial and commercial creators in September reached 52, breaking the new record for each month of this year. The institute said that the reason is: "This kind of deformed prosperity is due to the recent appearance of a large number of so-called guide societies. The fatigue of industry and the gradual decline of the sales industry are still a major obstacle to the prosperity of the market. However, comparing this year's situation with the same period last year, the industrial and commercial situation in this city this year is actually much better than last year." Probably after the summer of this year, the purchasing power of the market was slightly active, so general business operators wanted to take the opportunity to develop, but because the environment was bad, they still inevitably failed. This is the reason for the increase in the number of new creations and closures this year.</p>
<p>Although this year is still far from economic prosperity, there are examples of increased purchasing power. For example, the production index released by the Central Bank shows that it is generally rising. This kind of number is obtained based on unified tax calculation, which includes the numbers of foreign merchants, but the increase in output, in any case, the consumption is also increasing, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>According to the report of Shanghai public utilities, the commerce in the Shanghai Special Zone in October of this year had an upward trend, because the consumption of electricity and water was increasing. The use of electricity in commerce increased by 9.4% compared to the same period last year, and the industry increased by 15.3%. The use of tap water in commerce increased by 35% compared to the same period last year, and the use in commerce increased by 23%. The consumption of tap water and telephones is also increasing. The goal of making this report may be to prove that Shanghai is gradually prospering and increase the collection fees of public utilities cannot prove it. Because the development of public utilities, like the above production index, includes the numbers of foreign merchants in China, which is still very far from the word prosperity, but the increase in public consumption is undoubtedly increasing work, and the work is for production. Although the producers are not necessarily domestic factories, the consumers are undoubtedly Chinese.</p>
<p>Another proof is the number of check exchanges. The amount of check exchanges in the first ten months of this year increased compared to last year. If compared with the same period last year in October, the increase reached about 40%.</p>
<p>The number of government bond transactions has decreased sharply since the issuance of unified government bonds. The number of government bond transactions in October was only 220 million yuan, while it was 520 million yuan in the same period last year, a decrease of more than 50%. This is because the interest on government bonds has obviously been reduced after the consolidation.</p>
<p>Real estate transactions are still very quiet. Recently, the population of Shanghai has reached more than 3.8 million, which is 300,000 more than in the "January 28" era, but the need for real estate is still not active. Except for the unique amount of transactions in January due to the stimulus of legal tender (3.89 million yuan), the total number of real estate transactions for the whole year was only 12 million yuan, a decrease of 2.5 million yuan compared to the 24th year.</p>
<p>Due to the inactivity of government bonds and real estate, we can infer that the status of the two investments in the financial market is not important.</p>
<p>(5) Criticism of the Financial Market Situation Over the Past Year</p>
<p>The financial market situation in Shanghai over the past year is better than last year on the surface. The display of this improvement is that the financial market situation is calm and uneventful, and the purchasing power of the market has been slightly promoted. The former is the result of the financial institutions adhering to the scope after the panic, and the latter is the promotion of the stability of agricultural product prices, the bumper harvest in rural areas, and the improvement of the world economy. On the surface, the financial panic situation has turned upwards.</p>
<p>From the perspective of China's economic essence, it is a country with a long-term trade deficit. The year with more imported goods is also the year of superficial economic prosperity. The more imported goods, the more industrial and commercial operators can profit, and the financial market situation tends to be active. This is because Shanghai is a commercial port, and Chinese farmers buy foreign goods from cities, which is what the countries implementing silver policies call "the purchasing power of silver-using countries in the Far East." Under this economic prosperity, the rural areas are of course good, the cities are also very good, and the commercial and financial businesses are also good, but it only makes the national debt status increasingly heavier.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange after the new currency system has been very stable over the past year. However, long-term stability must have smooth international balance of payments as the only condition. These are all things that should be paid attention to when talking about China's economic recovery.</p>
<p>The dramatic upward trend of prices over the past year contains many reasons, and the impact of the sharp rise and fall, from the perspective of China's national economy, whether it is the cost of living index or the cost of raw materials, the former is related to the livelihood of civilians, and the latter is related to the progress of industry, which are very unfavorable. Our ideal is not a low price or a high price policy, but the stability of prices.</p>
<p>After the purchasing power of farmers is promoted, it has created the superficial prosperity of the economy, which is a way out for the financial business that is responsible for financing commercial funds. But this cannot be taken as an optimistic thing. Because we of course also hope for China's economic independence, rather than growing forever in a semi-colonial land. Judging from the current national situation, maintaining the economic prosperity of a semi-colonial land is probably a problem in the first place. (December 22nd)</p>

<h3>Telegrams Reporting Two Losses in Beijing</h3>
<p>Defeated by the Central Team with a score of 21 to 22, Defeated by the Military Academy Team with a score of 25 to 53</p>
<p>Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Shanghai Xintong Basketball Team played against the strong Beijing Military Academy Team at the Amateur Athletic Association at 3:00 PM. The weather was sunny and warm, and the audience numbered no less than 3,000. The referees were Jin Zhaojun and Xu Zheng. Before the match, a "warm-up act" was performed by the Reporter Team and the "28" Team. The "28" Team was the champion of the Zhongda Shijie Cup and had strong strength. It defeated the Xintong Central Team on the 9th, and had previously been defeated by "28". However, the Reporter Team, although nominally an old soldiers team, were in reality all veterans of many years. As a result, the Reporter Team won 36 to 37. After Xintong's recent defeat, their morale was low. For the first five minutes, they were able to hold on, but after that, it was all the Military Academy's game. The Military Academy players, under the command of Wang Yuzeng, attacked and defended with ease, and Xintong was at a complete loss. In the first half, the Military Academy scored 20 points, while Xintong only scored 3 points. After the break, the Military Academy continued to maintain an absolute advantage. Wang Yuzeng and Bao Wenpei's beautiful passing and accurate shooting won a lot of applause. Afterwards, Carson made repeated efforts, but it was like a single hand clapping, and he only scored a few points, barely holding up the facade. As a result, the Military Academy won by a large margin, 53 to 25. The improvement of the basketball standard in Beijing can be confirmed from this.</p>
<p>Military Academy Team Name Points Fouls</p>
<p>Forward Bao Wenpei 12 0</p>

<p>The Amateur Association held a banquet for the players of each team that evening, and the Xintong team members returned to Shanghai by the late train.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Shanghai basketball team leader, the Xintong Pirates, came to Beijing for their second expedition. The entire team of six was led by Carson. They arrived in Beijing at 1:00 PM on the 9th and played against the Central Team at the Amateur Athletic Association at 8:30 PM. Although the weather was severely cold, there were still more than 800 spectators. The Central Team moved quickly, and Li Zhenzhong was especially elusive, making it impossible for Xintong to defend. The Central Team led all the way, and finally defeated Xintong by one point, which was very gratifying. Although Xintong, under the leadership of Carson in the second half, tried hard to counterattack, it was ultimately in vain. The performance of both sides in this game was extremely exciting. Li Zhenzhong and Tang Shaohua's wonderful passing won a lot of applause. In the first five minutes, the Central Team took the lead with a score of 14 to 4, a difference of as much as ten points. The first half ended with 14 to 8. As a result, the final score was 22 to 21. Xintong will play against the Military Academy at 3:00 PM on the 10th. Judging from their strength in this game, they are probably not the Military Academy's opponent, as the Military Academy has many national players such as Wang Yuzeng and Wang Shixuan, and their strength is extremely strong. The lineup for this game is as follows:</p>
<p>Central Team Name Fouls Points</p>
<p>Center Tang Shaohua 4 8</p>

<h3>Jiangwan Cross-Country Run Second Practice Yesterday</h3>
<p>Full distance of 6 miles</p>
<p>The annual Jiangwan Cross-Country Team Championship, organized by the Western People's Sports Association, will be held in early April. Yesterday at 10:30 AM, the second practice run started at the west gate of Hongkou Park. The full distance was 6 miles. The Western teams participating in the practice run included the Royal Artillery, the French Army stationed in Shanghai, Russian émigrés, Socal, and the Chinese teams included Yi Bing, Shanghai United, Hongkou, Bai Hong, and Chinese Police, totaling nine teams. Although Mackenzie had signed up, he was absent yesterday due to business. A total of 84 players participated. However, due to the rain and snow of the previous day, the rural fields and roads were extremely muddy. However, the players were in high spirits and achieved excellent results, with no one dropping out midway. This year's British Army Royal Artillery team has three famous players. Although the others are slightly less strong, they have won championships in the United Kingdom. It is expected that the competition for this year's championship will be a three-way battle between Royal Artillery, Yi Bing, and Shanghai United. Other teams such as Hongkou, the French Army stationed in Shanghai, and Mackenzie are still strong and should not be ignored.

<h3>Training for Promotion of National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy</h3>
<p>National Language Society Regularly Opens Classes</p>
<p>The National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy was proposed by Tan Yaozong, a member of the National Language Unification Association, at the fourth transportation conference of the Ministry of Transportation in Beijing in the 11th year of the Republic of China, with the "Proposal to Change Railway Telegraphy to the National Phonetic Alphabet", which was passed for trial implementation. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, work began on compiling and printing the "National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy Compilation". In the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education announced the standard National Phonetic Alphabet. The Ministry of Transportation then sent technician Chen Yiyu to Ping to review and revise it in conjunction with the National Language Society. Recently, the Ministry of Transportation instructed the Hebei and other telegraph administrations, saying, "The revised National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy Compilation" is about to be completed. The method for receiving and calculating telegrams using the National Phonetic Alphabet has also been formulated and will be announced soon. However, there are very few personnel in each bureau who are familiar with the National Phonetic Alphabet and the spelling of the national language, which will be very inconvenient when the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy is implemented in the future. Attached is the outline for the training of personnel in the National Phonetic Alphabet Telegraphy and the table of symbols for the National Phonetic Alphabet telegrams, instructing the personnel handling telegraphic and business matters to receive thorough training in order to prepare. Article 2 of the training outline stipulates, "The reading and writing of the first and second styles of the National Phonetic Alphabet, and the standard spelling of commonly used single characters, words, and sentences in the national language, the National Phonetic Alphabet spelling shall be based on the National Phonetic Alphabet Commonly Used Characters Compilation edited by the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee of the Ministry of Education and published by the Commercial Press. The training shall be completed in two months." It is learned that the so-called first style of the National Phonetic Alphabet in the order is the phonetic symbols, and the second style is the National Romanization. The Hebei Telegraph Administration has scheduled to open training classes after the New Year holidays. The National Language Promotion Committee of the Ministry of Education has also scheduled to open classes in the National Language Printing House on Xidan Street starting from January 18, dividing into two classes: the first style (phonetic symbols) and the second style (National Romanization). Each class will be held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and will be completed in three weeks. Those who pass the examination will be given certificates for dissemination. Registration has been advertised in the National Language Society of the City Party Department.</p>

<p>The Bond Market Was Very Stable This Week</p>
<p>Due to the New Year holiday, the public bond market traded for only five days throughout the week, and the environment was very quiet. The market situation was very stable. The people's hearts were quite calm due to the quiet situation, and both the bulls and the bears were quiet and watching. In and out transactions became more chaotic and faded. However, some bulls have been slowly selling, causing market prices to tend to decline from hovering. However, the trend is still very stable, and there is unlikely to be a major change in the short term. The Renaissance Public Bonds have been listed on the market on the 7th of this month under the order of the Ministry of Finance. Because the outside chips have become almost extinct, the market price opened quite high, at 72.3 yuan. Because the goods are scarce and the price is high, very few people are interested in them. The progress of the whole week: Monday was closed for the New Year holiday. On Tuesday, because the situation was settled, people's hearts were all taking a wait-and-see attitude. Unexpectedly, a group of major players emerged very actively, and market prices fell by 3 to 9 corners. On Wednesday, the trend became more and more tired, and the chips on the table were quite crowded. However, after major players such as No. 11 and No. 13 purchased them, the market situation was tired but firm. On Thursday, the Renaissance Public Bonds began to be listed on the market. Because the chips were short, the market price opened surprisingly high at 72.3 yuan, but the trading was extremely clear. Because people's hearts were firm, the Unified Public Bonds were enthusiastically bought, rising 1.2 to 6 corners. On Friday, because the bulls and bears were mutually exclusive, the ins and outs became more chaotic and clear. The market price was quite hovering. On Saturday, the trend was extremely dull, and retail transactions were mostly for rescheduling and closing out. As a result of the whole week, there was a uniform decline of 2 to 6 corners. The total transaction volume was 30.23 million yuan. The comparison of its gains and losses, highs and lows, is listed in the table on the left. (Unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>

<p>Reuters, Bombay - At the beginning of the week, the Bombay cotton market had a slight surplus settlement. Later, due to the surge in the price of three-grade yarn, the buying atmosphere here suddenly became strong. Yesterday, the news that the Japanese government had tightened the management of yen exchange rates triggered a fierce selling wind. However, speculators, exporters, and local manufacturers took advantage of the fall to buy. The total number of Indian cotton shipments to Japan this week was 149,871 bales more than in the same period last year. Forward orders are huge, but there are many arrivals everywhere, and although the export industry is good, it is still difficult to absorb them all. Pingguoer fell 0.25 to 0.5 rupees, Aomula fell 1.75 to 2 rupees, Bai Luoxi fell 1 rupee, British cotton spot fell 2 points, and futures fell 45 points. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram of the 9th).</p>

<p>London Silver Is Rapidly Shipped to India</p>
<p>Due to Rumors of Increased Silver Import Tax in India</p>
<p>London Spot Silver Is Ample, and Discounting Is Under Pressure</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 9th - Clearing banks and other financial institutions have ample cash after receiving huge amounts of government interest, and can meet the needs of borrowers at any time. The discounting market is under pressure due to the abundance of cash and the scarcity of treasury bills.</p>
<p>Reuters, Bombay, 9th - The silver market has been dull and colorless this week. Although market prices have occasionally risen, inventories are too large, and they have eventually fallen back. Not only has the import of London silver not decreased, but the rumors that tariffs will increase have prompted London silver to be shipped out early so that it can arrive before the budget is passed. The average daily need in the mainland is about 80 bars. It is expected that there will be a surplus of about 30,000 bars after the February settlement. It is heard that Bombay has already confirmed a huge amount of silver worth 900,000 pounds, which will be shipped within the week. When the mail ship arrives this time, it will bring a batch of silver bars worth about 130,000 pounds.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various sources were stronger than before, with more than eighty firms arriving, carrying approximately sixteen thousand three to four hundred piculs of goods. Thin paddy rice accounted for forty of these firms, so market conditions continued to decline. Moreover, sales in this area were sluggish, and wholesalers were inactive. Only Qingdao brokers handled over a thousand bags of thin paddy rice, further weakening the situation. Prices continued to fall by more than a dime. The supply of thick japonica exceeded demand, causing a sudden drop of twenty to thirty cents. Du Yang pointed rice was unsalable, and the Yin Yuan market was fixed.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Recently, the arrival of goods from the river continued to be strong, about thirty firms. The market declined as sales of all goods had been very sluggish for days, resulting in over four hundred ships docked at the river. Yesterday, only a few shops put goods on the market, and demand remained sluggish. The market price of white japonica rice fell by another ten to twenty cents. Early rice followed suit with a drop of more than a dime. Yang Du Bu pointed rice was nearly two dimes short, and Bai Yuan rice was down by about a dime. Other types of rice fell by several cents to more than a dime. Given this situation, it is feared that there will be little improvement in the coming days.</p>

<h3>Ula of Jilin</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiang</p>
<p>In the cold winter weather, one doesn't feel terribly cold during the day because of physical activity. Only when sitting quietly late at night do your feet freeze, making you restless. Thus, I involuntarily think of the benefits of "Ula."</p>
<p>What is called Ula? Ula is a type of shoe made from Ula grass, suitable for wearing in winter.</p>
<p>Speaking of Ula grass, it is a specialty of Jilin. There is a local saying: "The three treasures of Jilin are ginseng, sable fur, and Ula grass." This grass grows in the mountains and fields, with stems three to four feet tall, triangular in shape, with sharp ends, and dense roots. New shoots grow from the roots every spring.</p>
<p>Every winter, when the land is covered in ice and snow, farmers busy themselves with preparing their Ula after dinner. The method of making it is: first, the grass is crushed very finely, then placed inside leather Ula shoes, and they can be worn. However, some also braid the grass into small braids and weave them into a pair of shoes. For the sake of aesthetics and warmth, the shoe opening is trimmed with scraps of fur. Wearing them is warm and lightweight, making them the best thing possible. There are specialized shops in various counties and towns, and even in Jilin City, there is no shortage of them. Moreover, the price is very cheap; twenty to thirty copper coins (about forty to fifty cents) can buy a pair. Wearing these things is very common.</p>
<p>Now that chilblains are appearing, I really want a pair of these, but where can I get them? Because of this small thing, I also feel the pain of lost territory. When will we get "Give me back my mountains and rivers?"</p>
<h3>A Group That Burrows into Crowds</h3>
<p>— Jiao Shijie</p>
<p>Some people living in Shanghai can live comfortably and quietly due to their different lifestyles, while others are forced by their environment to live in crowds all day long. Although they may hate the noise and fear being squeezed, they still have to burrow into the crowds. Who are these people?</p>
<p>The first type is the ticket sellers on trams and buses. Although the carriages clearly state in white paint "This vehicle is limited to ×× passengers," who counts the number of people? As long as there is space for one person to stand, another person can come up and fill that small space. Sometimes, it's so crowded that it's impossible to turn around. This is a common occurrence and nothing to be surprised about. At this time, I can only admire the skills of these ticket sellers. They can continuously say "Excuse me" while pushing their way through, and actually sell tickets from the inside out. Therefore, I say they are the type of people who, when seeing a crowd, push against it and burrow in.</p>
<p>The second type of people are those who sell things in amusement parks. They carry a tray filled with bananas, water chestnuts, dried tofu, melon seeds, etc. No matter how crowded the park is, they always have to squeeze in. Like swimming fish, they constantly burrow in and out. Even if there is no business, even if people are disgusted, they ignore everything and still go in and out like this. This is another type of person I admire.</p>
<p>The third type of people are the prostitutes in amusement parks. They are heavily made up, like shuttling butterflies, flitting east and west, constantly dazzling in front of many people, dazzling them until their eyes are blurred and their hearts are swaying. Thus, their great work is accomplished. This group can be considered the third type of people.</p>
<p>The fourth type of people is a group of idle people and troublemakers. For example, if a crowd is gathered on the street watching a fight or something, they must push through the crowd, walk in, put on the air of a big brother, inquire about the beginning and end of the matter, and then come forward to mediate, so that they can extort some money and get some benefits. Therefore, these people almost always want to stir up trouble. Now that something has happened, is there any reason for them not to squeeze in? This is what is called the fourth type of people.</p>
<p>The above four types of people are all those who burrow into crowds. They all live in this bustling Shanghai, just like others. And we often encounter these people.</p>
<h3>An Escape from the Wardrobe (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The Heroic Actions of a French Mother and Daughter</p>
<p>In August 1914, after the outbreak of the European War, British and German forces fought a major battle at Le Cateau towards the end of August. After the battle, a cavalryman named Fowler, who had served in the 11th Hussars Regiment for 21 years, became separated from his main force. His current problem was how to avoid being seen by the enemy and how to find food to eat. Like a wild animal, he hid in the deep forest, occasionally encountering kind French farmers who gave him some food. His embarrassed situation was truly indescribable. After several months of this, on January 15 of the following year, he encountered a savior in a forest near the village of Bertry. This person was named Bascon, who was unfit for military service due to a disability and made a living by logging. That day, Bascon was logging in the forest and saw this British soldier who looked neither human nor ghost. Filled with pity, he shared some of the bread and cheese he had with him. Then, he pointed to a haystack and told Fowler to hide inside. Because they didn't speak the same language, Bascon put a lot of effort into making Fowler understand to come back and save him after dark.</p>
<p>This loyal lumberjack kept his promise. That night, he returned to the original spot and led Fowler to his home in the village of Bertry. It must be known that this action was very dangerous. Even if Bascon was walking alone, he was already violating the German military order prohibiting night travel, let alone leading a British soldier. If discovered, he would inevitably be executed. Just as the two were about to enter the village, two German policemen suddenly walked over in the darkness, shouting and asking Bascon why he was still running around outside at this hour. Bascon replied, "My mother-in-law is sick and asked me to see her." The policeman then asked, "Who is with you?" "Show me your address and name certificate!" Oh dear! This was terrible. Bascon, with good intentions, tried to save Fowler, but unexpectedly, he encountered death as soon as he took action. Just as the situation was critical, a commotion suddenly broke out on the street, followed by the sound of gunfire, like a string of firecrackers. As a result, the two policemen ignored Bascon and his companion and rushed to the street to investigate a more serious case. Bascon took the opportunity to lead Fowler back home in a flash.</p>
<h3>The Dwarf Island in the Sea of Earth</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaokan</p>
<p>The World's Only Orchestra</p>
<p>In the southeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea (near the French border), there is a small island with an area of only 20 square miles and a population of less than 5,000, called Key Largo. Because the natives here are born with a height of less than four feet, it can also be called Dwarf Island.</p>
<p>The climate on Dwarf Island is exceptionally mild, and the soil is extremely fertile. Among the lush and tall forests, there are towering trees everywhere. In the vast fields, the fruits are like brocade, red, yellow, green, and white, hanging heavily on the green branches. Parrots with red beaks and green feathers fly in the sky, and flocks of white seagulls chew seaweed by the water's edge. A scene in a painting, a painting in a scene, it is truly the world's only orchestra!</p>
<p>Although the natives on the island have a body only three feet tall, they are born very strong and rarely suffer from illness throughout the year. Both men and women enjoy swimming and climbing trees. In the brilliant morning light and the vast evening glow, young couples hold hands and play to their hearts' content on the mountain peaks and by the water's edge, while singing love songs with a Japanese-tinged melody. Under this unrestrained play, a generation of passionate girls will promptly commit many romantic acts.</p>
<p>The natives here have deep-rooted traditional superstitions. For things that harm them, such as mountains, rivers, water, and fire, they believe that there are gods in charge. Especially for the fire god and the water god, whenever a volcano erupts somewhere, or a dike collapses, they undoubtedly believe that this is the result of the gods being angered by insufficient offerings, and they must find ways to sacrifice and pray. The biggest sacrifice is a virgin's precious life and beautiful blood. In this way, under the harsh demands of the gods, the most beautiful girl in the village will be seized by the masses, stripped naked, and sacrificed to the gods. In the flaming eruption vent, in the surging and turbulent waves, hearing the most tragic cry, the precious life of a virgin ends.</p>
<p>The construction of the natives' houses is also very special. They do not use brick walls or earthen walls, nor do they have thick beams or large pillars. All four sides are built with wooden boards, with windows opened on the boards. The window frames are not decorated at all. At night, they urinate and defecate arbitrarily in the house, completely unaware of the meaning of the word "hygiene."</p>
<p>Although Catholicism is now prevalent among the dwarfs, there are still many remnants of ancient ethnic heresies and superstitions. In the dense forests, one can often find fierce-looking idols and crosses placed together, similarly yellowed by the smoke of incense. To this day, dance festivals are still held regularly in various towns, preserving the customs inherited from ancient ethnic groups. When dancing, they wear a skirt made of grass and a strangely shaped ancient costume on the upper body. The dance is graceful, and the singing is melodious, which is also very enchanting.</p>
<h3>The Replaced Luan Feng</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 10 (Su Pa Sends Twined Silk with Strange Words, Huang Hua Grieves Over Falsely Cast Autumn Letters Adding Sorrow)</p>
<p>Guoqi said, "Why didn't you lead him to the old lady's room?" Aunt Liu said, "The old lady went to the Wang family at the entrance of the alley. I said I would go and invite the old lady back, but he repeatedly said there was no need. I thought that everyone in the family had run away, leaving a guest alone in the house, which would be very impolite, so I had to sit and keep him company in the main room." Guoqi said, "While he was sitting in this room, what did he say to you?" Aunt Liu said, "He didn't say anything." Guoqi said, "Did he flip through my books?" Aunt Liu said, "He didn't read any books either." Guoqi said, "Are you saying that he just sat blankly in this room?" Aunt Liu said, "Yes, he just sat blankly in the room. Later, he didn't know what he remembered, said to himself, 'No need to wait anymore,' left this note on the table, smiled slightly at me, and left. At the door, he turned back and said to me, 'There's no need to tell the old lady he came, lest the old lady feel bad.' In my opinion, he must have something on his mind." Guoqi casually crumpled the note into a small ball and threw it into the wastepaper basket on the corner of the table. He asked, "According to you, what's on his mind?" Aunt Liu said, "I don't know. If I knew, I would have told him." Guoqi laughed, "Female students are different from ordinary young ladies. They are like men and can go outside to visit friends without any problem. We are relatives, and she can come and play every day if she likes. What could be the matter?" Aunt Liu heard this and replied, "Yes." Seeing that there was still a hint of hesitation on the master's face, she excused herself and left the room. Guoqi sat in the chair, lost in thought for a while. Later, he thought again, "This body is like catkins stuck in mud," what exactly does this sentence mean? Thinking of this, he picked up the note from the wastepaper basket again, slowly unfolded the paper ball, placed it on the table, and gently smoothed it out with his hand. He paid close attention to those seven characters for a while, then placed it back in the collection of Li Yishan's poems, returned the book to the bookcase, put his hands behind his back, and paced back and forth in the room, thinking only of strange things. However, he only found it strange and didn't let Youmei's actions shift his attention. Because that afternoon, he had already received a letter from Menglan. The letter said that the two red beans had been received. He had always seen records of such things in Chinese poetry and prose, but had never obtained the real thing. Now that he had received these real red beans, it was enough to satisfy his longing of several years, and it was ten times more precious than the gift of fine jade.</p>
<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>White Ape Sunbathing</h3>
<p>— Xu Hengren</p>
<p>In front of the Manjushri Monastery on Mount Huangshan, there is a Manjushri Terrace, with a flat area of less than five feet. Sitting down there, looking up and around, the top of Tiandu Peak is on the left, and the top of Lotus Peak is on the right. Looking far into the distance, there is a vast sea of clouds, with many strangely shaped mountain peaks floating in the clouds, like the Penglai Islands at sea, appearing and disappearing, incredibly beautiful. Looking down diagonally, there is the mountainside of Tiandu Peak.</p>
<p>Always eager to overcome challenges, I walked step by step up the mountain in this freezing weather. When I reached the Manjushri Monastery, it was already late, so I spent the night there. The wind was very strong at night! It snowed that night.</p>
<p>The next morning, the sky cleared again, and the sun shone from the top of the mountain all the way to the mountainside. I got up and sat on the Manjushri Terrace, feasting my eyes. Suddenly, I saw a stone cave in the mountainside of Tiandu Peak. Many apes slowly climbed out of the cave. After more than forty had come out, three small ones supported a large one out. Only this large one had gray-white fur, while the rest were blue. Reflected in the sunlight, they shone brightly. Then, more than forty small blue ones climbed out, making a total of more than ninety. The large one sat down on the flat area in front of the cave. Small ones sat around it in front, behind, and to the sides, appearing like guards. The others who were not performing guard duty included some that were holding even smaller ones and nursing them, just like human mothers nursing babies. In addition, some were climbing trees to pick privet berries to eat, and some were pulling up grass roots to eat on the hillside. Two others climbed down from the tree, crawled to the white ape, spat out the privet berries in their mouths, and fed it. They also helped it groom its whiskers—the white whiskers had already reached its navel. Its cheeks were red—as if painted with rouge. After the white ape ate, it coughed—"Cough..."—just like our old men coughing. Two others were fighting over food. The white ape glanced at them, pointed with its left forelimb, and coughed twice—"Cough, cough," and they didn't dare to fight anymore. I was enjoying watching, when suddenly the sun was covered by clouds. The group of apes returned to the cave one after another, in the same order they came out. First, more than forty went into the cave, then they helped the white ape into the cave, and then they all went completely into the cave.</p>
<p>I watched for half a day. After watching, I was hungry, so I ran back to the Manjushri Monastery to eat. While eating, I chatted with the monks and talked about the apes' antics. The monk said, "The apes under our Manjushri Terrace are different from those on other mountains. The fur of those on other mountains is yellow-gray, while the fur of those under Manjushri Terrace is blue. There is only one old white ape, and there is no other like it. I don't know how old it is. Speaking of this ape, it is truly magically powerful, no less than the Monkey King of old. Its kind never harms the vegetables, fruits, and corn planted all around our mountains. It is said that this old ape manages its kind with rules. According to our master's teachings, in the past, whenever someone came to the mountain to perform rituals and chant scriptures, on the day when the merits were completed, they had to make some wheat flour steamed buns for them to eat, called vegetarian monkey buns. There is also a classic scripture. As long as the buns are placed near the ape cave, and a young monk is called to recite that classic scripture, the apes will know to climb over and take one each, and not take more than one. If there are dozens of buns, there will be dozens of apes coming." I said, "If hundreds of buns are made, then will hundreds of apes come?" The monk said, "Our master has a number in his mind and will not ask the benefactor to make that many buns." I responded with a mix of belief and doubt. In a moment, the meal was finished. I left the Manjushri Monastery and walked step by step down the mountain in the misty fog.</p>

<h3>Snowy Night</h3>
<p>— Nie Yun</p>
<p>The days are shorter in winter. When dusk covers the treetops, goose feather-like snowflakes are flying outside the window, swinging like swings in the cold wind. As they approach the ground, a gust of wind picks them up again. Looking out at the dim sky, it seems as if rice flour is being sifted from a distant place, parading across the sky. Leaning against the window lattice, I think of how it must be skating time in my hometown!</p>
<p>At this lonely dusk, the sound of casting iron comes from the neighboring courtyard. Is it that family's daughter ending her lonely life, or are those monks and Taoists doing hopeless ghost tricks?</p>
<p>I pulled open the curtain of the back window, and the sky was already a gray-black expanse. I vaguely saw a bright corner lamp and moving shadows in the central hall, guessing that the frantic scene there was as lively as it was on the daughter's third birthday. But is the old lady mother wearing her brocade skirt and jacket from when she was married, receiving guests among the guests, and raising a face full of smiling faces?</p>
<p>That was still last year's affair, is that unmarried girl only having a glorious day? And now she's been sick for nearly three months. Every morning, standing at the back window, watching those doctor's sedan chairs shuttle back and forth, that old lady also appearing in person to welcome and send them off in person! Guessing that she must be burning incense and praying in front of the Guanyin statue in the warm pavilion, reverently asking her old husband in heaven to help his daughter, the widow only has this pearl on her palm to please her lap now. Moreover, she has this distant hope, she wants to find a compatible son-in-law for her daughter, so that the mother and daughter can rely on each other for the rest of their lives, and she also wants to think about the sacrifices to her old partner, but she doesn't know that her daughter's precious youth has passed away, a thirty-year-old girl has her own requests!</p>
<p>After the glorious birthday passed, the thirty-first spring came. The rolled curtains around the hall were all lifted, and the swallow's nest in front of the eaves was babbling with yellow-beaked nestlings, and the mother swallow was flying hurriedly on the edge of the pond, as if competing with the butterflies in the flowers, but she was burdened with the responsibility of being a mother, grabbing food to feed her children, and when the autumn geese came south, they led their children back to their old home in the south like daughters returning home!</p>
<p>Upstairs in the hall is the girl's boudoir, where the lake silk window curtains are almost always deeply hung. It is said that her family's master had been a magistrate in the past, so the official lady would naturally not easily show her face. They live deep in the boudoir, with kind and attentive maids in attendance, playing a game of chess, reciting a few poems, that is, when the mood is high, they only play with dominoes to pass the time. Even going down the hall requires turning over the almanac for an auspicious day.</p>
<p>Time is really a ruthless demon, the cannon sound under Wuchang City changed the times, and at the same time shattered their happy family, and that large mansion became their residence after their death. But the past cannot come again. In the annoying spring, the window curtains on the hall floor were also opened. The yard is desolate, only a pear tree in the corner of the wall blooms with three or five white little flowers, so the hostess takes down the moon zither hanging on the wall, adjusts the strings, and sends out the sorrow from the depths of the wild goose's heart from her sharp fingers. Sometimes she burns a furnace of musk in front of the window, she watches the fluttering swallows there thoughtfully, she may be praying to heaven: that her father is safe underground, her mother is healthy, and her own wishes, but she is now short of a clever maid!</p>
<p>That corner of the red building will always close off her resentment! In the autumn when the nestlings return to the south, she fell ill, and it has been nearly three months now!</p>
<p>The snow is falling more densely, in clumps, and by the time the lamps are lit, the corners of the house have already been covered with a white coat.</p>
<p>The sound of gongs and cymbals rang all night, and a delicate red gauze lamp was hanging outside the window of the hall floor, which is a sign of calling souls in the hometown. Watching the light of the lamp fluttering in the gale, I seemed to feel the warm feelings of my hometown, and silently recited the line from "I know the former land after passing by my hometown," blessing that declining family to be happy!</p>
<p>Near dawn, the sound of gongs and cymbals was mixed with mournful crying. Looking out from the back window, the red gauze lamp fluttering outside the hall floor had gone out.</p>
<p>The snowflakes cover the ridge, the treetops, and the paving even more thickly, but they cannot cover up the mother's crying.</p>
<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3>Discussing Warming Around the Fire</h3>
<p>— De Lin</p>
<p>Warming around the fire was originally a very refined thing. In addition to warming up, writing something like "Occasional Notes by the Fireside" would make it seem even more leisurely and elegant. However, in this day and age, warmth is not something everyone can obtain, and warming oneself doesn't necessarily require a fire. There are also things like "water radiators," which are actually much more comfortable than smoky fires. So, although both can warm the body, the methods are vastly different. Of course, when the weather turns cold, every living creature loves warmth. Those who cannot afford to sit around a fire or live in a room with a water radiator can only lament their misfortune.</p>
<p>Speaking of misfortune, it certainly exists. In such cold weather, being able to sit in a room and light a fire to warm oneself is not easy. People wandering the streets without cotton clothing are too busy envying to even think about it. But even the act of sitting indoors and lighting a fire can lead to disaster for the unfortunate:</p>
<p>"Liu Ruohui from Hunan and his wife, Zhou Zhiping, lived in a small room in the Baoxingfang, No. 7, North Henan Road. The night before last, the weather was quite cold, and before going to bed, they lit a coal briquette stove in the room for warmth. Unexpectedly, they were poisoned... immediately, they experienced shortness of breath and lost consciousness... both are in critical condition..."</p>
<p>This was the report in Shanghai newspapers the day before yesterday. This news itself is enough to illustrate why the unfortunate are unfortunate. A couple living in a small room typically doesn't have the privilege of warming themselves. Even after such a big disaster, they still lack basic hygiene knowledge. If they had known that coal gas trapped in a room could cause poisoning, they wouldn't have done it. But if they could have spent a few more dollars to install a few sections of lead pipe to vent the gas outside, wouldn't it have been safer? However, they didn't know about this clever method – actually, it's not that they didn't know, but that they couldn't afford it. Judging by their living in a small room, it can be seen that hiring a craftsman to install lead pipes was "beyond their means!"</p>
<p>People shivering on the streets undoubtedly envy those who are warming themselves by the fire in small rooms. However, they don't know that the people inside are also envying those living in rooms with water radiators. We naturally extend our utmost sympathy to this unfortunate couple, but we don't hope that they can also live in rooms with water radiators. Instead, we hope that they gain more hygiene knowledge, and even more, we hope that the unfortunate friends wandering the streets can one day live in a small room!</p>

<h3>Central and Southeastern Studios Co-Screen News from the Suiyuan Front Lines</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Suiyuan War, the Nanjing Central Photography Studio and the Shanghai Xinhua Film Company, recognizing the great significance of this war, specially dispatched personnel to brave dangers, penetrating deep into the front lines to risk capturing war footage, in order to allow people across the country to understand the truth. In addition to screening the captured anti-Japanese war scenes continuously in theaters across the country, in order to give the audience a comprehensive impression, the two parties have agreed on a cooperative approach, combining the footage captured by both sides. The content is entirely from the latest footage taken from the front lines, such as the real situation of soldiers on the Sui East and Sui North front lines resisting the enemy with hot blood, and the rear military preparations, which have not been shown before. It is reported that the film is currently being screened for the first round in the Central and Southeastern theaters in this city simultaneously.</p>
<h3>Worse Than a Dog</h3>
<p>In today's society, because of the disparity between the rich and the poor, the lives of the poor are far inferior to the lives of dogs raised by wealthy families, truly causing one to lament, "Worse than a dog."</p>
<p>Ge Furong and Weng Shirong, in the Tianyi Film Company, are two well-known fools. Their foolishness is comical, and every move they make is laughable.</p>
<p>Recently, in the film "Wealth and Prosperity" in which they starred, they were responsible for the work of raising dogs for a wealthy family. They often stole dog food, and one day, they were discovered by the owner, who scolded them, making them not know whether to laugh or cry, and they could only lament their unfortunate fate.</p>
<h3>Aviation Heroine</h3>
<p>— Screening at the Great Shanghai</p>
<h3>Our Hometown</h3>
<p>The fifth part of "Lianhua Symphony," a Lianhua blockbuster produced by Hua An, "Moonlight Serenade" directed by He Mengfu, features the interlude "Our Hometown," composed by musician Sha Mei. The melody is tragic and passionate, and the lyrics are particularly upright and magnificent, inspiring profound reflection, and are truly a rare work in today's Chinese music scene. The song has been recorded and released by Baidai Company, number 35208. The lyrics are recorded below:</p>
<p>Do you ask about my hometown?</p>
<p>My home is in that place!</p>
<p>That place is so good,</p>
<p>There are forests and coal mines,</p>
<p>Fields are full of sorghum,</p>
<p>The treasure is truly immeasurable, truly immeasurable,</p>
<p>There are also thirty million compatriots,</p>
<p>Every one of them is full of hot blood,</p>
<p>Who knew that one day five years ago,</p>
<p>That place was forcibly occupied,</p>
<p>From then on, we lost our hometown,</p>
<p>From then on, we wandered in all directions,</p>
<p>Wandering for five years,</p>
<p>Five years, suffering endless hardships,</p>
<p>Five years, we are always on the brink of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>Now we can't bear it anymore,</p>
<p>To endure, where will there be an end?</p>
<p>We want to see the tombs of our ancestors again,</p>
<p>We want to see our sisters and parents again,</p>
<p>We'll climb the White Mountain again,</p>
<p>We'll swim in the Zu River again,</p>
<p>We want to go home,</p>
<p>Go home,</p>
<p>Go home!</p>
