<p>時評</p>
<h3>日本調整對蘇關係</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>據前日向盟社東京電。日本有田外相為調整對蘇關係。決定於日內邀請蘇聯駐日大使至外務省。督促進行解決滿蘇邊境懸案問題。日蘇中間的重要外交問題。主要的原有兩個。一為北洋漁誠區題。一為滿蘇邊境問題。漁業條約在不久以前已經簽訂。問題已去其一現在留下這個邊境問題。又將在日本催促之下重開談判。這顯示幾年來不斷地緊張着的日蘇關係。在今後將有漸趨緩和之勢。</p>
<p>不過對於日蘇關係的這種變化我們不能單純地作為日蘇中間的一個事情來看。而應當作為整個遠東局勢中的一種現象來看。這種變化的現象。在遠東整個局勢的發展中反映着什麼意義呢。我們以為有三種意義是可以尋出的。第一。日本對於蘇聯的態度。已由急切的挑起糾紛。轉為暫時的尋求妥協。第二。日本所以要這樣改變它的對蘇外交政策。是由於它目前外交地位上的孤立。第三。日本為要挽救它外交上孤立的困難。將不僅要“調整”它對蘇的關係。同時也將設法拉攏它對於英美的關係以保持它在中國所獲得的侵略果實。</p>
<p>我們記得在數月前日德同盟簽訂之後。蘇聯立刻向東京提出抗議。并將日蘇漁業協定的簽字。加以延擱當時東京方面曾表示非常的張皇而有田外相的受到各方責難。也顯出十分狼狽的狀熊。直到李繼諾夫表示漁業協定可以簽字。日方才轉愁為喜。甚至本來由蘇聯提出曾經日本多方留難的邊境懸案問題。現在也在有田外相催促之下。重開談判了。這種情形所顯示日方對於蘇聯的緩和態度是極可注意的。</p>
<p>日本外交地位的孤立化。在過去的一年中。表現得最為顯明。這是由於日本向華北內蒙的加緊進取。引起了英美蘇法的共同焦慮與不滿所致。冀東傀儡劇的扮演引起了全世界的非笑。武裝走私的惡風受到列國的責難。最近偽匪軍在驅使之下。進攻綏遠。更沒有一人會加以同情。在英美法蘇之間。現在顯然已有外交上的多少默契。共同反對破壤遠東和平的侵略者。這從各國外交人物的言論上。都可以得到證明。這種外交形勢的逆轉。當然是東京當局所能覺察到的。於是本來堅持一元化的。強硬政策的現在也不得不改變作風。進行多方面的拉攏妥協了。</p>
<p>然而中國在這種遠東局勢的變化中。也不能不萬分警覺地注意着的。一年來中國對於侵略者的壓迫。多少能採取有效的抵制。這除了我們本身力量的發揮外在國際外交方面的呼應活動。當然也有不少關係。我們現在決不能讓侵略者再把這種外交上的優勢。拉回過去。在他人這樣開始外交努力之際。我國也應加緊外交上的努力。勿因內部政治上的微小問題。而忘却外交局勢上的重大變化。</p>
<h3>日本進口貨激增實行統制外匯</h3>

<p>［東京］日大藏省為强化一九三三年八月公布之外國匯兌管理法、今日發表立即實施之省令、澈底管理為進口支付及其他用途之外匯、國內各方雖有不滿之反響、當局則因下列種種原因毅然施行、第一、歲杪日元匯率暴跌、新年迄未回漲、苟不加抑制、有益趨不安之傾向、第二、因將來進口關稅之增加及下屆財政年度之鉅額軍費、遠過國內軍需工業生產力所能吸收之數、勢必增加外貨之進口、尤以軍需品之數為鉅、第三、因外匯資金之不足、迫使日政府准軍需品優先進口、並加緊日常必需品進口之限制、大藏省新通令雖規定本年七月三十一日廢止、但屆期是否不再展延、尚屬疑問、（八日中央社電）</p>

<p>［巴黎］關於禁止志願兵赴西班牙一事、此間負責人士、須就德國復文、加以評論、謂德國復文、對於英法兩國所提議一節、並未完全否定、以故關於禁止志願兵問題之談判、仍可繼續進行、而國際緊張局勢、亦因此為之緩和矣、至於德國復文中、所提某項條件、則負責人士、均認為碍難實施云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>紗市始漲繼跌、趨勢異常錯雜、完全受大阪三品紗市之交配也、晨初三品紗本月猛騰十一元幾、市場人心震撼、浮戶山空翻多、檯面緊俏、各月一齊漲破五十元關外、午後本月二品紗開出再見高峯二百九十元○一角、詎料收盤反動、下瀉十二元、二月期慘落十三元八角一時消息播來賣氣頓熾、三盤狂瀉一元八•九、復跌破五十元關內、收盤三品紗來電確跌角•市況愈挫矣、</p>

<p>現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各幫買去統計九百八十一包、售價漲一元線漲三元、各幫價額列下、</p>
<p>棉市本屬平菠、因三品棉市歩歩狂漲、横跳三·四元之譜、美印棉市亦復回漲、人心牽入佳境、午後因紗市回落、且傳東洋有强化外匯之説、市勢急轉直下、本月再跌破三元關口矣、</p>
<p>棉花近跌遠漲</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因美印棉市俱見上漲、人心提起、兼之紗市轉趨高翔、大阪三品花遠期狂跳三元外、買風更熾、一盤後稍見回挫、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲三•四•五•六角、午後開盤因三品花開盤遠期再跳一元外、買氣略熾、但有一部份多方乘機大量出籠、二盤開紗市不振、跌風復起、重入疲途、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌四角半至五角、查賣出大昌成一千八百担、錦昌四千三百担、森康二千七百担、豐泰二千四百担、仁豐三千四百担、泰昌三千五百担、生源三千七百担、福康三千四百担、同和一千八百担、協成一千一百担、買進吉豐一千六百担、通記三千九百担、賡豐四千八百担、慎記一千九百担、元一二千担、長和八千八百担、益昶一千四百担、恒昌二千七百担、慎昌一千三百担、昶記一千二百担、一日間最高低價列左、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>買氣復旺　粉麥回漲甚勁</p>
<p>粉市開盤後、各月份又呈激烈反漲之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲六角四角不等、坎拿大漲六七角左右、利物浦漲二辨士零、當開價後、因市面連跌二三日、迄無反顧、一般業外投機、突見活躍、且目下衹拍四個月、場面不暢、故買戶一盛、即易抬轟、近遠期之開價、較前日即漲五六分不等、二盤時徵見回跌、旋因多頭仍有暢進、市氣又為提振、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易未暢、價趨盤旋、以目下爭競之焦點、純以國外報價為轉移、惟業中心思、終因市值已高、問訊無多云、</p>
<p>麥市上午開盤後、各月份市面、呈一致挺漲之象、以洋麥報價、回漲四角至六七角、并以開市以來、連跌幾日、不免反動、故各月份開價、即因此高抬、近期計提八九分、遠期漲一角外、良以國內小麥雖有馀積、散處行客手中、未易集中、故一遇機會、人心易於激動也、迨至下午開盤、本月份交易甚少、遠期則業外又復收買、市氣步緊、六月份新麥、因臘雪時降、人心見定、故漲度無幾、現麥福新辦進二千包、價好二三分、開窰灣•洋河•淮安•各麥六元五角七八分至六元四角半不等、</p>
<p>雨雪中河下米斛開較少</p>

<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到貨頗旺、約有五六十號河下存船三百六七十艘、市上各貨去胃、因雨雪紛飛、各店上市寥寥、各種交易有限、惟白粳囤戶取巧稍化、白粳價小數分至一角、薄稻少數分、早稻價跟小近角、白元價小角外羊杜埠客尖價小五六分、其餘各貨疲軟、</p>

<p>二十五年洋客秈米市况回顧</p>
<h3>證券</h3>
<p>公債盤旋中帶軟勢　復興債竟日未開出</p>
<p>昨日公債市場、因時局無變動人心亦極感疲軟、市況愈趨呆滯、蓋因多空雙方、相持堅定、靜取觀望熊度、致市價升降極微、頗有盤旋之勢、為多頭獲利甚多了結出售、略帶疲色、然其趨勢、仍將醞釀有待也、復興公債、因籌碼短少、而價格寄昂、全日間竟無人顧問當上午開盤、為七十七•三十五號等賣出踴躍、市價均下跌一角至一角半、惟散戶尚多收購、次盤趨勢由疲而轉堅、戊丁種為十•七十七號等仍在拋賣不少、績小五分至三角、三十五•四十五號則轉有買進、乙種下月起上漲一二角、下午開盤、市況又見沉悶而混沌、五號進胃甚濃、丁丙等均好一角左右、戊甲本月及乙下月則小五分、收盤進出又形寥落、大戶極少交易、散戶亦賣買不一、行市大致參差於五分一角間、全日結果、一致稍小五分至一角、成交總數、計三百二十三萬五千元、茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>國產青糖漲勢仍烈　實為出新期內所罕見</p>
<p>昨國產糖依然緊俏、繼續上升、但在出新之際、有此畸形發展、實為近年來所僅見、恐前途必有變動耳、號盤昨有建幫開出刁青五百餘包、十三元七角、比升五角、粵汕等幫開出南江青遠片青三百馀包、十一元八角、比升八角、北海片青六百餘箱、十一元、比升七八角、又拋兌石門片青二百件、一禮拜裝船、價為十一元一角半、祝青三百數十包、十三元三角、比升五角、提莊青十四元四角、黃崗青十四元、來南青十三元六七角、共成交三百馀包、遠期日糖有明治大里神戶等開出三四月份共達三萬馀包、價以YP嘍為標準、七元四角馀照退、</p>

<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>黑瓜子再上漲</p>
<p>由于產區存底缺乏之故</p>
<p>黑瓜子近以各產區存底均交稀缺、市盤一再上展、而存貨較稀、從而拉提、故市象更見緊俏、昨市明光子已開至二十元、比前又升一元、其餘較高之貨、亦叫漲一二元不一、連日本街各熟貨瓜子公司均有購進、內地亦有去胃、出口幫較淡、行盤濟魁子叫售二十五元、提莊子二十四元、徐魁子二十二元半、明光子十九元半、臨淮關了十九元、後市尚防再緊、</p>

<h3>五金</h3>
<p>本廠元釘囤戶趁高回出　青鉛鐵缺貨大漲</p>
<p>本廠元釘、因洋釘廠缺少原料（即裂釘之元絲、故倍司行情節節上昇、最高價每桶曾沽至十一元、惟廠方出貨不多、致購者仍有向隅之嘆近數日來、囤戶方面先前收進之貨、趁目下行情高昂之際、急圖脫手、所以連日市場時有大批現貨拋售、昨日開出二千桶、價每桶沽十元零二角半、但門莊交易及同業拆貨行情仍須十一元至一元零五角、</p>
<p>青鉛鐵近來現貨售幣、新貨不到、行情乃節節上升、每箱沽二十一元、（原箱）其零星截鐵十四寸二十寸為三十三元五角、二十寸二十八寸三十四元、昨市開出四五斗箱、由印刷製罐廠辦去、至客幫買賣、因無現貨、故無開出、開新貨約下月初可以裝到云、</p>

<p>民國二十五年，是過去了。在這過去的一年中，婦女們對於社會國家的貢獻如何？這里姑不具論。反正說起來，也是給奢侈與怠惰等等，佔去了大半頁。不過過去的，讓它過去就算了，在今年這一年中，我希望婦女們，工作出一點進步的成績來，免再蹈已往一年中的覆轍。</p>
<p>為免再蹈已往一年中的覆轍，我以為下開的三條，是不容忽視的：</p>
<p>㊀勞動的提倡　去年一年中，各地的公民訓練，勞動服役等等，風起雲湧。國內的萎靡之風，為之一振。本來，“强國先强身”，這是每一個小學生，都知道的，何況是在這非常時期中，更不可少的，是結實的身子。但是很是遺憾的，在這過去的，一年之中的公民訓練，勞動服役等等，都讓男性專美於前了。在一般的家庭中，男性清早上操場，女性還是睡在被窩中作夢。男性荷起了鋤頭，鍫子，築路，浚河，女性却只是躲在家中，打牌，玩耍。而愈是知識女子，愈是這麼的茍安逸樂。這種態度，是萬萬要不得的。女性也是中華民國的主人，與男性同樣地負責復興國家民族的責任的。要負起這種重任，不可少的，是要有耐得勞，吃得苦的精神與身體。因此，我希望有智識的婦女們，從今天起，領導着提倡勞動，加入勞動的集團去。</p>
<p>㊁人格的保持　婦女從事職業，果然是無可非議的。但是在事實上，在婦女職業的大帽子裹，正不知包含着若干不可告人的黑暗。在我們這個社會間，是盡有不少牟利的市儈，利用着婦女，以招來主顧。此輩僅用以作招徠主顧用的職業婦女的以職業為名，賣任為實，差不多是成了今代的無可諱言的事實。如在去年曾風行一時，而現在已遭取締的嚮導社，便是一例。不過職業，是無分貴賤的。婦女職業的本旨，本來不過是提倡自食其力的獨立生活。所以婦女而充嚮導員，也並非絕對不可的。不過第一個要素，是不可忘了“自食其力”。能自食其力的，雖為女工，也是十分神埾的。不勞而獲的，雖是坐在辦公室裹的大椅子上的，也不過是一個花瓶而已。因此，我希望職業圈中的婦女們，從今天起，不接受智識或勞力，所應得的報酬之外的一個大錢，以保人格。</p>
<p>㊂社會的服務　這是對於一般飽食終日，無所事事的婦女們的要求，這裹的所謂社會服務，不是指謀求織業。我的本意，不過是求家庭婦女們，努力於一些社會事業而已。例如去年所舉辦的平民識字教育，便有不少家庭的主婦，壓迫着傭僕，不許上課聽講，否則以停職為威脅。就如這一回子事，已十足表現着我們對於社會福利事業的態度。再舉一個例，如最近的援緩運動。努力縫製或捐贈絲棉背心的，果然是有，但是吝給子女少許援綏捐款的，也未始沒有。這些，實在是一個對於國家與民族前途，極堪憂慮的現象。因此，我希望一般的家庭主婦們，從今天起，不要把自己置身於社會之外。而須把社會視作為自己的家庭一樣。</p>
<h3>幾個值得表揚的婦女</h3>
<p>— 縱續</p>
<p>韓蔪王夫人　韓蔪王諱世忠，是跟岳武穆同時的民族英雄，他的夫人，即是大名鼎鼎的梁紅玉•岳傳中砲炸兩狼關，是作小說者對於她的有聲有色的描寫，世人的崇拜她，據說大部分是由此而起，但她不但有勇，抑且有智。鶴林玉露里嘗載她的一段佚事，說她既跟蔪王約為夫婦，後來蔪王立殊功，為中與名將，遂封她為兩國夫人，一日，蔪王邀兀朮於黃天蕩，幾乎已把他擒住了，可是偶然一個不留心，竟被兀朮鑿河遁去，夫人聞報大怒，立刻上奏疏，說：一世忠失機縱敵，乞加罪責，”舉朝的人，都為之動容，其明智英偉有如此，求之今日的婦女界中，有這麼一位人物嗎？</p>
<p>周遇吉夫人　周遇吉是明末的賓武關總兵，闖賊來攻，他是與城俱亡的，死後被諡忠武，崑曲中有別母亂箭一齣，即演的是他的悲壯故事。他的夫人劉氏，從乃夫帥幕中，喜讀兵家言，屢佐她的丈夫立奇功。周遇吉陣亡之後，他督率婦女巷戰，被她擊殺的賊，竟近萬數，直至矢盡，才自殺以殉。明史把她附在周遇吉傳中，山西魏敏果公象樞有詩詠之，題為：“甲申闖賊陷寶武關周總兵戰死，”詩云：“大呼高帝出城闔，三百年來此一身。帳下投醪多戰士，軍前拔幟是孤臣，裹屍不愧真男子，擐甲曾聞有婦人，若使將軍猶未死，彗芒那敢近中宸。”所謂擐甲曾聞有婦人，即指夫人也。</p>
<p>楊誠齋夫人　楊誠齋是宋朝大儒，他的兒子東山做過我們湖州太守，所以誠齊先生到過新市，德清縣志上有他的詩可按。他的夫人羅氏，年紀在七十以上了，每寒月黎明，還早起詣廚下躬作粥一釜，遍享奴婢，然後再使奴婢們各自服役其子東山先生對她說道：“天塞，何自苦如此？”夫人道：“奴婢亦人子也，清晨寒冷，須使其腹中略有火氣，乃堪服役耳。”東山先生道：“夫人老，且賤事，何倒行而逆施乎？”夫人怒道：“我自樂此，不知寒地，汝為此言，必不能如吾也。”東山先生便不敢再言了，又夫人平居首飾止於銀，衣止於紬絹，生四子三女，悉目乳，嘗對人說道：“饑人之子而哺吾予，是誠何心哉？”（見鶴林玉露）像這樣的婦女，古今來真是不可多得，把她來作賢妻良母的典型，也當之無愧吧。</p>
<p>汪魏美夫人　汪魏美名渢，浙江錢唐人，與人落落寡諧，所以大家都叫他汪冷。明季，舉鄉試，知府錢某，愛其才，把他的女兒許給魏美。結婚的時候，新娘子盛飾入門，魏美心中大不為然，誡她以後不必如此，於是她就屏服飾，却侍婢，以疏布親操作，一對小夫妻，乃相敬如賓了。明亡，魏美抱故國之痛，遂棄科舉，姻黨中有希望其做官者，欲强其試禮部，又恐魏美不答允，以千金視她，說道：“汝能勸夫子駕，則畁汝。”她答道：“吾夫子不可勸，吾亦不愛此金也。”倒底完成了她丈夫的氣節，區區一女子，能深明大義如此，真令人佩服。（見二林居集）今有受賄賂。而陷其夫於不義者，對這位夫人，當下愧汗。</p>
<p>按古今來值得表揚的婦女，很多很多，但以本刊篇幅所限，我止舉了上述四位。此四位中，有智有仁有勇，可以給目前非常時期中一般歸女的參考，因為非常時期中，尤迫切的需要此種典型的婦女。</p>
<h3>平郊的婦女生活</h3>
<p>— 征雁</p>
<p>北平郊外的鄉村家庭，大都是貧困不堪的。四郊鄉民，十九以種地為業，惟以連年旱荒，故荳麥等的收成不佳，生計更苦；而其他有的打石，趕大車的，則他們尤為痛苦。——因此，平郊的婦女們，在這種家庭環境之下，當然是陷在黑暗的生活裏掙扎着了。</p>
<p>可是，一越是貧困苦厄，勤奮耐勞的精神也愈厲”；在北平四郊的婦女們，是够得上這種歌頌的。她們只知道對着惡劣的週遭反抗，沒有悲哀和咒詛自己的命苦；這就是她們除了整天到晚理着家務，和幫着男子們到田野去農作以外，還有幾種固定的副業，那便是編蓆，編蒲，繍花，挑花，和縫紉……等工作。一逢稍暇，便是她們的勞作時間，甚至晚上非至夜半不休；以增加家庭的收入。</p>
<p>幾種副業中，以繍花挑花的較優，她們大多是給平市的一般刺繡鋪子，論生產量的多寡給工資的；（女工很少）普通一人每天能得到三四角至六七角甚他編蓆的僅能日得二三角；縫紉洗衣的也約有二三角：編蒲的形式不一，有蒲帽，蒲鞋，蒲圈子，蒲墊不等等，每一件東西的編成，往往需時間半天至一天，而售去的代價，却祇得到一角二角，有的更只能換得十幾個銅元，那是更苦。不過，繍花的因着近年北平刺繡業的沒落，和習刺繍的婦女反多的緣故，也大不如前，而微簿得很可憐了！</p>
<p>最可憐的是一般極度窮苦的人家，由七八歲至十餘歲的女孩們，她們穿着襤褸不潔的衣服，鳩形鵠面，一天到晚的在郊外蹲伏地行走着；拾取那遗在地上的柴木。尤其在秋冬的季節裹，連天西北風自蒙古高原吹來，飛沙走石，不見人面，氣候由寒冷而至斷指裂膚似的；她們的拾柴工作，也就格外忍饑耐寒的加勤了。原來這柴木除了偶有出打柴者遗落的以外，都是因著時有吹折樹枝的飓风，且多有自其他高原地帶吹來的，所以越到冬天風大樹枯的時候，遗留的柴木也就愈多。她們這種拾柴木賣去的代价，大概在年長的每一年能换得二三十元，年幼的僅十元左右。其苦况可知！</p>
<p>看了這一篇文字，我們也可想見都市的北平貧苦婦女生活如何了？然而，勇於為家庭耐苦的賢良婦女們，她們是愉快而沒有抱怨的。可惜這幾年來，因外力侵擾的加緊，使她們的生活，尤其感受着痛苦了！</p>
<h3>從援綏運動看到婦女的救國實力</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>婦女，在一班舊腦筋的人看來，是和男子的地位不同，除了在家裹抱孩子和担任烹調，縫紉之外，其飲的工作是什麼都不應與聞的，更談不到對於國家，社會有義務要盡，有權利可享了。然而事實却不這樣，婦女也自有其相當的力量，而為我們所不可小視的。尤其是在援綏運動這件事情上，我們已明白的看出婦女所具的實力是如何？</p>
<p>自從匪偽進攻綏遠，全國的民眾一致參加援綏工作而後，婦女界也並不後人，就上海方面說來，各個歸女團體的領袖，便聯合起來，組織“婦女界綏遠勦匪慰勞會”，奔走呼號，向各界募集捐款以及各種應用物品，慰勞前方將士。小姐們，太太們參加援綏工作的結果，所獲得的成續，也非常可觀。還有各校的女生，停了課縫製絲棉背心，習醫的婦女，有很多人要到前線去服務，救護傷兵，連得絲廠裏的，紗廠裹的女工，也都以勞力所得，捐作援綏之用，更有許多貧家女子，自顧義務結絨線生活，捐送前方，所以援緩運動可以說已是普遍到全個婦女界，力量當然也是不小，上海是這樣，內地的婦女界，正和上海一樣，救國並不後人。</p>
<p>這裏，婦女的教國實力是如何？在參加援綏運動上，已明白的告訴我們。本來全中國四萬萬五千萬人民，要是除去了婦女，那男子們的人數，恐怕不到一半；因此，援綏運動祇讓男人去幹，那所得的實效，也恐怕不到一半。另一面，婦女也起來參加了，實力就要增加不少。在這非常時期，要求中華民族的自力更生，祇有在全民族不問男女老幼，各盡自己的力量，參加實際的工作，才能救亡。那麼我們對於婦女，又豈可小視呢！</p>
<h3>各地婦女生活片段</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>筆者最近訪問過幾位不同籍貫的女學生，請伊們發表了各該地的婦女生活狀況很多老生常談的說話，一概略而不錄；但取其積極化的特異生活，述為片斷，將來續有收獲，當再貢獻給本刊讀者。</p>
<p>湖北恩思縣　那邊地方極度貧窮，是個非常不開化的下縣，恩思縣有幾句傳誦民間的歌謠：“天無三日晴，地無三尺平，人無三兩銀”；這是形容雨量太多，不宜稼穡，所以地瘠民貧，一人私資，無有超過三兩銀的，可見那邊人民窮的程度了；恩思歸女體格壯健，習於勞作，肩負八九十斤的担子，稀鬆平常，並不希罕；婦女職司內外，內主中鐀，外事經營，無論什麼場所，都有婦女的踪跡；男子們抽烟賭博，列為常課，轉在家裹無所事事，任性玩樂；遠省人偶然看到這些男子的消遣墮落情緒，還要疑心是置身朝鮮呢；伊們不倚靠丈夫！倒有很多男子做了婦女的附庸！伊們從頭到腳，不見一點裝飾品，各人保持着本來的面目。</p>
<p>南洋爪哇　這短短的幾句話當然代表不了整個的爪哇婦女生活，更不能代表南洋各屬，那邊士人，重男輕女，積重難反，受教育的婦女，如鳳毛麟角，生活也比較優越，普通婦女，一樣的耕田種地，或登山砍柴，並有很多向市上去做買賣的，以補家用之不足：老年婦人，管理三餐：中年和少年婦女，衣食不足，白天或夜晚，跑到外國人家裹為人按摩，得幾角錢，維持生活，這按摩工作，據說很普遍，登門兜生意，視為慣事，可是只限按摩而已，和國內都會風行的推拿或按摩，是不可相提並論的了</p>
<p>廣東潮州　婦女革命思想，極度奔騰澎湃，行為是前進的，不甘落伍；從事婦運，不讓都會專美；貧苦婦女，盡日工作，以求經濟獨立，豐裕之家的婦女，亦不願坐享其成，必找些輕鬆的手藝，伊們以為“人是會勞動的動物！我們女子是人！我們就應該勞動的”！認勞動是做人的本分，</p>
<p>大連老虎灘　老虎灘，地近海隅，居民多半是漁業，婦女生活在這種環境裹，當然也在“漁業”上用功夫，伊們搗錢結網，成了終年生活的泉源，間有少數婦女，跟男子一起捕魚，丈夫兄弟們出發捕魚一次總有好幾天担擱，伊們先期烹調若干適口的菜蔬，預備他們數日的佐餐物；臨行伊們排列海岸，目送－程，青年夫婦們，且來雨次飛吻，說上許多吉利話兒：等到船快要歸來，伊們又先期預備裝載魚類的器皿；假定超過了歸期，深怕海面上遭了風險！伊們便整日的吞聲飲泣，或是虔誠地到廟裏去禮佛。</p>
<h3>良心供獻</h3>
<h3>常州城內的賣報女子</h3>
<p>— 君瑩</p>
<p>常州的女子，即使識得幾個字，生得美麗而又在妙齡，可是出路問題，却是很少的，近來有某報館，招請識字的女子賣報，算為提倡婦女職業的新基礎，此風一開，各報爭相倣效，一時寂寞的城市內，時見此輩艷裝濃抹的妙齡的女子，挾了大批的報紙叫賣，真是別開生面，可與姑蘇的賣花女，先後媲美了。</p>
<p>講到伊們的生活，無論在精神上，在物質上，都是感到非常○痛苦，伊們每日都是夾着一卷卷的報紙，用柔和的聲音，向行路人叫賣，至於伊們的足跡，無論在窮街僻巷，或茶樓旅館，時常的可以看見伊們，向客人售報。</p>
<p>伊們每月的酬勞，祇有八九元，除一小部分，是化在脂粉與衣服上，其餘多給家中生活，雖然的如此菲薄，但却還要身體嬝娜有致，粗通幾個文字，能喊出每日報上所載的消息，才能僥倖的被報社中錄取。</p>
<p>社會上腐敗的分子，當然不免，伊們往往受了金錢的誘惑，或別種緣故，常被欺騙，甚至借買報為名有意與伊們胡調，伊們的精神上是很感到痛苦，婦女在內地，想站立在社會上，其困難也可見一般了。</p>
<p>請節省脂粉費，援助前線殺敵的戰士！</p>
<p>請縫製棉衣褲。送與前線冰天雪地中的戰士！</p>
<p>請研求救護術，準備到前線去服務！</p>
<h3>寫給：初做母親的姊妹們！</h3>
<p>— 佩侶</p>
<p>育兒十誡</p>
<p>年青的姊妹們！當你第一次做母親來養育你自己的小天使時，我可以知道你非但亳沒經驗，不能使你小兒肥白強健活潑可愛，並且有使你小兒遭遇到意外的危險；所以，在這裹我就寫一些關於初次育兒時的常識吧！</p>
<p>㊀不要用嘴喂給小孩吃，因為大人嘴裹往往有一種細菌傳給小孩，小孩的抵抗力弱，不免發生疾病，很是危險的！</p>
<p>㊁小孩子哭了，不要隨即哺乳，一則當他憤怒的時候，喂下奶去，有礙消化，二則他還在抽噎的時候，容易把奶吸入肺管，引起咳嗽。</p>
<p>㊂冬季睡眠時，不要把小孩的頭也悶在被窩裏。小孩也正和大人一樣，需要新鮮空氣。</p>
<p>㊃孩子欲睡時，不可過分搖盪以催促他早些安眠，因為那樣使他頭腦盪昏，終於麻醉，雖熟睡之後也時常夢哭夢笑，應該讓他自然入睡才是。</p>
<p>㊄小孩神經非常靈敏，容易要驚駭，所以日間宜睡於靜僻的地方，近旁切忌噪雜。</p>
<p>㊅孩子的目光，不要讓他長久地直視或斜視某處，免得造成對眼或斜眼。</p>
<p>㊆孩子的手，不要讓他含在嘴裏，一則免得徒損唾液，再則免得病的多一接觸機會。</p>
<p>㊇小孩雙腿還沒夠强健的時候，不要勉强使他直立，以免有傷骨節，或造成X形腿或Q形腿。</p>
<p>㊈夏天在哺乳之外，應該多給以開水，因為孩子也流很多的汗，消耗很多的水分，不要單使他以乳充飢，以乳解渴，吃了過多的乳汁，每易引起消化不良症。</p>
<p>㊉小孩的衣服，無論冬夏都應該寬大，不可過小，免得妨礙呼吸，有損肺部。</p>
<p>完了！僅以此十條育兒的常識，貢獻給諸位年青的姊妹們！</p>
<h3>“小姐須知”</h3>
<p>— 胡野吟</p>
<p>最近在許多的文字與圖畫綜合的刊物中看到許多像“小姐須知”一類的文字，看了後使我往往會有一種惡劣的感覺；如此在一本刊物叫做“小姐”的裏面，我發現一位先生像法律似地定下了許多，抄幾條在下面：</p>
<p>假使你夢見和一個人男人親吻，那你趕快防備着不久碰見一個騙子了。</p>
<p>留神男人的手走上你身上的軌道，那時他一定會許多站頭停住。</p>
<p>喜歡吃酸的東西的時候，少在男人前面吃。</p>
<p>春天少碰到軟的東西，夏天少碰到黏的東西。</p>
<p>假使你在男女同學的學校裏唸書，男教授問你的時候，你儘不妨不答。</p>
<p>最好不要吃香蕉，這會使你失掉手指的曲線美。</p>
<p>看見一朵花，你應當想到臨時有人來採。</p>
<p>好啦！好啦！我再也不用多抄了，我得經濟請者的時光，因為這些東西根本就是毫無價值的東西；它們的價值，除了給有閒階級的小姐們作飯後無聊時的消遣外，簡直是亳無用處的。</p>
<p>而且，就上面抄的幾條看來，有幾條簡直是亳無理由的，如第一條：有的祇不過是說說俏皮話，我相信，一個小姐們看了後，也許會發怒的。</p>
<p>自從五四運動以後，小姐們都自己覺悟了起來要求自己的地位，口口聲聲要平等，要解脫男子的束縛，做男子的玩物乃是莫大的恥辱；但，民國已經二十五年啦！而小姐須知的條文中仍是這樣一種條文，我不禁為小姐們一嘆！</p>
<p>中國現在所處的地位，中國現在所需要的，大家都很明白，所以，為了民族前途，為了國家的前途，我不能不將小姐須知的作者們加以一番責備，因為他們是不負責的，他們是以迎合有閒階級們的需要為目的，他們忽略，時代的需要，在痛責之馀，為另寫“小姐須知”如下：</p>
<p>㊀留神你們自己的地位，留神你們自己的周圍；當心那些防不勝防的毒箭。</p>
<p>㊁在真正無聊的時候，切勿看小姐一類的文字圖協綜合的刊物。</p>
<p>㊂盡自己一份力量，為女同胞們排除一切毒箭；來一個偉大的清潔運動。</p>
<p>㊃男人和女人原是同樣的人；女人並用不着在男人面前躲躲晃晃，反之，伊們該和男人一樣，一樣地做時代的先鋒！</p>
<p>㊄失掉曲線美並不是女的羞恥，但使你失了靈魂的人才是你不共戴天的仇人！</p>
<p>㊅春天是生長的時期，夏天是茂盛的時期；所以，春天的開始便該有良好的計劃，夏天的來臨正是工作最緊張的時候。</p>
<p>好啦！好啦！我也可以停下啦！越寫越多，但最要緊的，還是希望女同胞們自己看重自己，好好地爲國家，爲民族，向前邁進，找尋光明的大道！</p>

<p>僑胞關切祖國</p>

<p>日商勢力雄厚</p>
<p>暹羅以農立國、近年來對商業已漸注意、其政治方面、亦力圖振作、惟日人在暹之商業勢力、異常雄厚、其營業方法、甚為遷就、各項貨物銷售之初、均不計價格、迨銷路漸廣、始訂立合同、且其價格低廉、非各國所能及、並用種種方法、鼓勵商人推銷、如銷售日貨最多者、可免費赴日本游覽、暹羅當局、以日本貨便利、反稱之足以為復興經濟、</p>
<p>推銷國貨意見</p>
<p>僑胞對於祖國、現非常關切、自喜採用國貨、惟國貨價格稍昂、且廠商又不敢放膽經營、本人此來、專為接洽推銷事宜、已與數廠家數度會談、本人在暹係主持國貨聯營社事宜、暹地僑商、均喜直接向廠方貿易、以其手績較為簡單、故此來亦希望各國貨廠商、採直接交易辦法、國貨在暹銷路最佳者、為日用物品及布匹等物、</p>
<p>盼望中暹通航</p>
<p>關於中暹通航事、曾有所聞、甚盼早日實現、藉謀國貨之發展、中華工業國外貿易協會、將在星加坡設立國貨辦事處、足以為國貨在南洋推銷之樞紐、本人在滬、將作較久之勾留、與國貨界繼續接洽一切云、</p>

<h3>所得稅施行條例第十五條之研究</h3>
<p>— 沈立人會計師</p>
<p>我國自有歷史以迄於民國二十五年十二月三十一日午夜止、是為無所得稅時期、（局部開徵者及所得捐等不計）、二十六年元旦起、各類所得稅全部開徵、在我國之財政上經濟上均為一大改革、當此新稅開徵之際、舉國人士、莫不深切注意其所訂之條例、研究其施行之方針、考現時我國關於所得稅之法律有二、一為所得稅暫行條例、凡二十六條、一為所得稅施行細則、共四十九條、前者為所得稅之根本大法、統論綢領、後者則細述其條目功夫、補施行條例之不足、而於徵收之方法、則在施行條例中述之綦詳、所得稅之徵收、雖總分為營利所得薪給報酬所得及利息所得三類、然三者之中、不論其自數字上經濟上觀之、均以營利事業之所得為最亘、為最繁複、需要研究之處亦最多、統觀所得稅全部施行條例中、關於營利事業之所得、以第十五條為最重要、茲就該條內容與續者一商確焉、</p>
<p>第十五條之原文為“計算第一類所得時、應就其收入總額減除營業期間實際開支、呆賬•折舊•盤存消耗公課、及依法令所規定之公積金、以其餘額為純益額、依暫行條例第三條規定之稅率課稅”、此條中“實際三字、頗有疑問、“實際”就普通之解釋、其意即為實在、惟本條中列舉應減除之各項、捨開支公課及法定公積外、其他各項、大都均出發估計、即開支一項、有時亦不能求得其實際之數額、茲逐項論之、</p>
<p>㊀開支　開交之計算、有應收應付制、或稱權實發生制、及實收實付制、或稱現金收付制、二種、各業可權衡情形、自行決定、公司法中並無規定、惟既採用一種之後、不得隨意更調、蓋決定採用一種制度之後、如繼續應用、則在第一年雖對應繳稅款、或有驟多驟少之影響、而在以後數年中、仍可補償、其最後結果相同、若自會計理論君、則應收應付制、對於大規模之事業較為合理、今本條中定為實除開支、其意似為實際付出之開支、其未付而已耗者、均不能列入矣、</p>
<p>㊁呆賬　所謂呆賬、並非實際已倒之賬款、普通在會計年度結果時、根據收帳情形、而佔計一應提“倒賬準備”之數額、若照實際呆賬之字面解釋、必指實在已倒不能收獲之帳款、始可在收入總額內扣除、</p>
<p>㊂折舊　折舊之意議、本有理論與實際二義、實際之折舊可以二例明之、設以六千元購置汽車一輛、至一年後、如將該車出售得三千元、二年後可得二千元、則第一年之實際折下野為三千元、第二年為一千元、此一例也、又如路旁之電桿通常可用十年、則自第－年至第九年、其功用如、至最後一年始行損毀不可用、其實際折舊、必至第十年始行發生、而在前九年皆無須乎折舊、會計上對於折舊之計算、均為理論的、</p>
<p>㊃盤存消耗　貨物在盤存時之消耗、係屬估值之結果、並無一定標準、亦不能稱之為實際、自施行細則頌佈以來、敝處時有來函詢問、關於本條之疑義、今擇較重要之數則、及其答覆附錄於下、</p>
<p>㊀問　倘遇客賬中已列入倒帳打銷、而在翌年忽又收獲、則此收到之數應如何計算、始符合所得稅條例之規定、</p>
<p>答　來問中所謂“符合所得稅條例之規定”、在事實上所得稅施行細則中、並無此項規定、但就原則推論、已行打銷之倒賬、在第二年收到者、應作為第二年之盈益、蓋第一年已打銷、盈益必因之減少、課稅亦低、第二年收回後自應列入盈益內、重行繳納其應負担之稅款也、但此點與開徵所得稅日期之先後、亦有關係、設倒帳之打銷、係發生於開徵所得稅以前、而在開徵所得稅後、忽又收回者、此收回之數不得作為收到年度之盈益、因法律不追即往、收獲之款既屬於開徵所得稅以前、自不應課稅也、</p>
<p>㊁問　小號對於折舊素無規定、以前因營業發達、敝東將各項固定資產打除折舊甚巨、今聞所得稅迅將實行、可否將攤從過多之拆舊從行加入資產中、</p>
<p>答　此種情形、在我國營業發達之商號為常見者、但自開徵所得稅後、以前折舊鉅者、以後盈益必增、抽稅即巨、故為減輕課稅之負担計、應即將多提之折舊、轉為資產、作合理之糾正、</p>
<p>㊂問　敝行對存貨之盤存、以前為圖隱匿盈益計、過意低估、與成本市價相差甚鉅、此種估值方法、與所得稅之徵收、有無抵觸之處、</p>
<p>答　所得稅暫行條例及施行細則中均未規定、存貨估值方法、各業均有其特性、可斟酌情形、自行定一標準、惟一經規定、即不得隨意更動、如欲變更、必須呈報徵收所得稅當局、並說明理由、</p>
<p>（各界如有關於我國所得稅之種種、疑問、可函詢上海戈登路二七五號中華會計師事務所、當就所知、詳為答覆）、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“綏遠前線極安寧”</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>六日看報，見載“綏遠前線機安寧”，着實大吃了一驚。人之岡我，已處心積慮，且非寸土尺地的讓與便可饜其欲望，而今前線突告“安寧”，為知“寧翁得馬”，不是大禍降臨的預兆？幾年前曾讀雷馬克的“西部前線平靜無戰事”，在結末的時候，西部前線的將官報告是“平靜無事”，而前線上的小兵死在敵彈又有誰知呢？這裹不過是强調那“戰爭”的殘酷，可是我却聽到了一句無言的呼喊———我們不要為表面的“平靜”樂觀，而究其實際還是一樣地危險的啊。如果這句話有他的真實性這時候却正用得着。</p>
<p>在六日的“綏遠前線安寧”的大標題下，我們看到的是：“二日迄五日敵機已四日未飛來，紅格爾岡土木臺等地情況異常安寧”。或者，在冰天雪地中應戰的戰士，連日來的激戰已太疲乏了，因此，敵機不來攻我。已算是“安寧”，且也可以稍得舒息機會。這是怪不得的，怕的却是怕我們後方的人不察實情，便以這舒適狀態的“安寧而滿足，又來興高采烈地放爆竹，慶賀勝利，那便上了敵人的大當了。</p>
<p>本來，我們為了“根除”戰禍，是不得以“敵機”已四日未飛來”便滿足了的。現在即使退一步想，我們只為了“守”吧，也應顧慮到敵機不來的原因，———是停止侵略呢？抑是調動和補充部隊，準備在養精蓄銳後又大舉進犯呢？</p>
<p>關於這兩問題的是非，我們還是讓“二日迄五日敵機已四日未飛來”的這四日的事實來作答擾吧。</p>
<p>二日電：王英聚集殘匪復編為軍，三旅重砲一營駐商都屯墾村。又李守信部六團，包悅卿十三四五等團及野山砲二團均叢集商都。三日電：偽軍王靖修部二千馀由多倫開抵商都。張以哲（張海鵬子）部騎兵千馀在商都附近騷擾人民，毫無紀律。四日電：關東軍大聯隊進駐張北縣城，并運到坦克車百輛，偽軍于芷由部約千人今日（四日）由多倫開向商都。偽軍現造渡戰壕雲梯，機場停敵機二十架，裝甲車三十馀輛，佈置緊張，擬由紅格爾圖及土木臺兩線犯綏東。五日電：張北商都刻已成某方擾綏重要根據地，近由熱境運嘉卜寺大批軍火，較失敗前增兩倍，即分發前防各匪部。王英李守信均被召回化德。</p>
<p>在前線，敵軍的調動和補充已充分地證明“安寧”是表面的了。何況，在新年中“友邦”還給我們以兩件“貴重的禮物”（一是派軍艦至我沿江內地常熟太會一帶活動，測量水位，且向岸上用重機關槍射擊。一是二日晨派飛機飛青島領空散放五色小旗及傳單）。也是“有意識的”的動作吧！</p>
<p>今年是“牛年”，我們應學牛的蠻幹精神根絕匪患，而不應再學“鼠年”一樣畏首畏尾，以“表面的安寧”而滿足的了。</p>
<h3>扯旗山</h3>
<p>— 玉路</p>
<p>才進了港口，我們第一眼看到的，那便是非常巍峨的，作為這南方大港的靠背的“扯旗山”。</p>
<p>船，多數是晚上進口的，那麼，扯旗山給予一般旅行者的印象，那更是非常深刻。一個黑巍巍的影，便像個屏障模樣橫在我們的眼前。那龐大的黑影如果像個魔鬼，那麼，他一定是披着件閃耀着磷火的長袍，無數亮光便在山的四過熌爍，樣子非常奇異地可愛。</p>
<p>假使是在日間，那麼你更可清楚一點地，用審美的眼光來看這天然的險要了。</p>
<p>香港是山島。對的，它的確是山形成的，扯旗山便是香港的母親聞名全世界的大英帝國太平洋領地的重鎮，便是建設在這山的腳下的。它的形勢使香港變成現在這麼個非常扼要的地位。</p>
<p>山頂，正如我們白日里所看到的，是飄揚着那誇耀着所有權的“米”字旗。那麼影隨風搖動着，的確是莫大的欣慰，對於那貪欲的統治者。山，也是非常秀麗的，再加以建築在山腰裹的别墅式的洋房，更像替一個姿色美麗的少婦晝眉點唇，增加不少風韻；然而，也正因為這巍峨的山給半山房屋壓縮成了一個小山峯了。——慣做住居在香港的人，是不大提及它的。</p>
<p>當然，一切人工的裝飾是“有所企圖”的。一個女人打扮得妖妖饒嬈也自有她的道理；扯旗山所以如此，不也是為了要陶醉一些來自歐洲的假期旅行者嗎？每年夏天，這些別墅式的洋房是自有主顧的，不過，這裹有一個條件，更正確點說，該是“苛例”，那便是“黃色皮膚的Cbinaman不交易”，那是上帝赐給白色统治者的特權啊！（不過，這兒也有“例外”，據說那已差不多歸化了的買辦何Ｘ爵士是“特許”建宅於半山。）這“苛例”，或者這“特權”而今不知撤銷了不？</p>
<p>除了別墅，款待短期旅行者的還有“山頂酒店”，那設置的貴族化，正如它的價目一樣，是我們平民百姓想也不能想的。這，和位置於尖沙咀的“半島酒店”等，在香港是有數的貴族酒店。當然，這些也不過他們對國內的有錢的。cntleman的一稱“禮物”罷了。</p>
<p>我們不要以為山高便交通不方便，這無疑是“杞憂”。這兒的交通，是一條非常平滑而敞寬的汽車柏油道，來便利一般“有汽車者”。此外，還有那非常著名的“山頂車”便利遊覽。這種車子，香港人通叫“山頂火車”，但並不如一般火車，不過形式外表不相上下罷了。這種車子是靠了一條非常堅牢的縴纜來連貫，是在三四十度角的角度上山的。行駛得很緩慢，鑑賞山景，異常適宜。</p>
<p>山，是人工的地移植了許許多多歐陸的，或是非洲的熱帶植物，再加上香港地位的適宜，和四面濱海，所以這兒的溫度實在是頂適宜的，不冷不熱，極值得稱道，那怪不得很多人常到這里遊歷了。</p>
<p>這裏無疑是一個天上世界。人世間的一切，這兒都可以洗却，是一個清凈的世界。不過，當然，這也和一切紳士們的享樂的地方一模一樣，是非常惡心的。這不單止在那加以人工的“人工”上已渲染了無數可憐者的血肉，（光是那“山頂車”的裝置，據說已不知死去多少華工。）和壓榨多少人的食糧；便是從它本身說，那些坐在沙發上胖白白的紳士，他們的肚子裹不就常常計算怎樣吃別人的血來養胖自己嗎？</p>
<p>然而，到底仍有人說“山”的城市，和那“水”的城市——威尼斯，是各有各的風趣呢。</p>
<h3>牛車</h3>
<p>— 魯平</p>
<p>太陽，已悄悄地躲到了一片灰色雲版裏面，天空中糊着一層濃重的灰黯，寒風嘯着，塵沙揚着，整個的宇宙已彷佛要冰結起來了。</p>
<p>“北國的氣候倒底是和南方不同的</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>。”想着轉過了一個山坡，便走上了那條通包旺的羊腸小徑：但是從這里到包旺的足足還有二十多里路呢。</p>
<p>老牛好像走得很乏了，牠脫脫地向着那條無人的小徑上前進。我望望天，天已一刻一刻地暗下來了，風刮得呼呼地發呌，好像馬上就要下雪的樣子。心裏焦急着，希望早點到了包旺，但是牠只是慢慢地踱着，一點兒也不肯跑快，我拼命地用鞭子抽着牠，依然沒有用。</p>
<p>車輪在那條不很平坦的山徑上滾着，顚簸得非常厲害，幾乎把一車子的高梁子也顚覆了。我很擔心，不要連車帶人一起翻進了山𡵿裏去。</p>
<p>今天那條老牛可作怪，腳上老是粘着重鉛那麼地提不起來，雖然鞭子不停地在牠屁股上揮着，牠每給抽着一下，勉強奔了幾步，但奔不上七八步路，又停止前進了。我眞有點生氣，牠今天要不是有意和我搗蛋嗎？於是，那重重的鞭子便又雨點似的落到了牠的腿上，身上。</p>
<p>“賤畜生，賤畜生，賤畜生！”拍——拍——拍……但，我立刻又將正在抽牠的鞭子收了回來，憐憫似的說：“也許，也許牠已病了吧！”</p>
<p>牠實在也太辛勞了，春耕，秋收，夏耘，冬運，一年四季都不會有多少休息的時候，又沒好的食料餵給牠吃。</p>
<p>天氣眞可冷勁了，風吹在臉上幾乎像小刀子在削，兩隻手上的指頭更好像給截去了一樣，我把氈帽上的耳朵拉了下來，遮住了臉，又將手指在嘴上吻了吻，仍舊使勁地在老牛的屁股上抽了一下，鼓着勇氣向着那條蜿蜒的山路上前進。</p>
<p>光樹桿子在空中擺着腦袋，一羣禿頭的烏老鴉，“呀！呀！呀！”地在枯林里面飛繞着，彷彿找不到牠們的老家一樣。我焦灼地坐在牛車上，像一個孤獨的行腳僧，在那寂寞的長途上趕程，這輛破舊的木車，和那頭病弱的老牛，算是我唯一的伴侶了。</p>
<p>高空的黑幕漸漸展開來，大地上的一切全給夜的魔鬼吞噬了。</p>
<p>“夜了，怎麼力呢？”想到這兒離開包旺至少還有十里來往路程，身上又冷，肚子又餓，老牛已不能再走了，心里是害怕着：雖然我胸兜里還有三隻乾𩟠𩟠沒有吃掉，然而我現在也不想到去吃它，身上的冷汗直透着浹背，那雞皮疙瘩却一顆一顆地竪了起來。我自已在心里想着，不要現在有一頭可怕的野獸躥出來，將我吞噬了去。</p>
<p>一叢一叢的林子向我身邊移過去，有時驚動了一頭斑鳩，拍嚓的飛了起來，使我唬了一個大跳。拍嚓的飛了起來，使我唬了一個大跳。傍邊土崗上的夜鶯，也“噁恨！噁恨！”地呌着，遠處更隱約地傳來幾聲狼嘷：我戰慓着，屏息了呼吸，不管老牛的乏不乏，只拚命地在屁股上加着鞭子。</p>
<p>漸漸地，已能夠望着一些火光了，而且包旺的犬吠聲也可隱隱地聽到了，於是，才把一顆懸空的心放了下來，胆子頓時壯了好多。吻吻那雙麻木的手，將袖口拭去了額上的冷汗。</p>
<p>“到了，你可以休息一回了，快走，一刻兒就要到了。”我又輕輕用鞭子在老牛的背上拍一下，似安慰，又似哄一個孩子般的對牠說。</p>
<h3>夜醒人</h3>
<p>— 劉亡</p>
<p>大概是近來心緒不怎麼好的緣故吧，睡到了床上，許多不知道從那兒來的思想，千頭萬緒的，像一條條繩子般圍繞着我，使得我不能立即安睡。要經過了相當沉長的時間，等那些思想把腦子攪昏亂了，才會糊裹糊塗，朦朧入夢。</p>
<p>可是，不知什麼時候，又會無端地醒轉來。想來距離真正熟睡的時間，並不會長的吧？這時，夜已很深了，但無法可確定是幾點鐘，雖然時鐘是在滴答滴答地不息的走動。它的勻和的聲息，應和着我的心的跳動，使得我的心，感覺到分外的空虛，而又分外的沉重。</p>
<p>翻了個身，小小的鐵床在發着吱吱的叫響，我還是睡得不舒服。勉强把雙眼閉攏了，像是受着什麽壓迫一樣，不久又給彈簧似的睜開了。望着黑暗的房間，一陣空洞之感，深深地襲擊着我。獨個兒睡在這房間裏，也覺得更渺小了。</p>
<p>街燈的光，從玻璃窗子裹穿進來，射在墻上，劃起一道幽微的線條。顯得那麼無力，那麼悽涼。而窗前那株法國悟桐的槎椏的枯枝，不時用它的影子來摩拂這墻壁，有如許多魔鬼的小手，施着催眠術，待人靜靜地熟睡之後，要攫取你的靈魂一樣。</p>
<p>外面十分靜，除了夜風的呼嘯，和它搖撼着樹枝，飄下一片兩片的落葉，而發出窸窣的聲響以外，便什麼都聽不到，真如在荒涼的原野裏一樣地可怕。</p>
<p>因此，我真的想起了原始社會的人類生活，以及那些在菲洲的，中國西南部的深山中的野蠻民族的生活；又從這情景，聯想起在故鄉的靜夜裏這時應該有怎樣一種狀態的念頭；直到許多雜亂的想念把我引進夢鄉的邊沿的時候，忽然外面陣聲響，把我驚醒了。</p>
<p>“胡——”，像旋風那麼，一輛汽車花窗前的瀝青路上馳過。雖然是那樣輕徹的嚮動，却也把這都市的夜靜暫時劃破了，那猶如夏夜的青黑的天空中，馳過了一線光亮的流星一樣。</p>
<p>也許這汽車裏載着那些公子哥兒，剛從舞場裏倦舞歸來吧，我想。不然，這時候會有什麼要事坐着車子到外面馳驅呢？一定的，那是一個醉眼朦朧的夜之享樂者所有的；說不定，在他的身伴，還斜靠着一個美麗的歌姬，在向他賣弄色情的誘惑的媚笑呢！</p>
<p>而不久，在遠處，工廠裏的汽笛拉起回聲來了。那些不同的調子，在競爭着誰呌得響喨，抑揚地，激越地，有如深山餓狼的狂號。從那工廠的大門裏——像狼的血盆口一般的大門裏，開始要吐出許多被榨取光了血肉的人羣；同時，新的一隊，又浪似地湧進去，填補了那個空位子。想到這，我便會感到一陣難耐的顫抖，和止不住的憤怒與不平。</p>
<p>我渴望着天早一點亮起來。</p>

<h3>The Executive Yuan Telegraph Orders Sun Weiru to Take Up New Post Quickly</h3>
<p>Yang Hucheng, etc. Have Not Yet Telegraphed to Nanjing. Wang Shuchang's Departure Date to Gansu Undecided. Various Parties Telegraph Yang to Obey Orders.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Wang Shuchang, the newly appointed Pacification Commissioner of Gansu, has been visiting Minister of Military Affairs He Yingqin and others for instructions for several days. On the morning of the 8th, he further consulted with various related parties. The date of his departure to Gansu can only be determined after the arrangements are completed. (Special dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Sun Weiru, the newly appointed Chairman of Shaanxi, has not yet taken office. On the morning of the 8th, the Executive Yuan specifically telegraphed Sun Weiru, ordering him to quickly take office, preside over provincial affairs, and report his arrival to the Yuan. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] He Yingqin visited Zhu Shaoliang yesterday morning at 10 o'clock to discuss the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu. Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong have not yet telegraphed to Nanjing. (Special dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Xu Liang and Xie Ke arrived in Tongguan at 5 p.m. on the 7th to meet with Fan Songfu for discussions. They departed for Luoyang that night to meet with Liu Zhi for further consultations. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Since the opening of the highway between Xi'an and Tongguan, twenty to thirty long-distance buses have arrived in Tongguan from Xi'an every day, carrying approximately four to five hundred people, waiting to transfer to the Longhai Railway to return eastward. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] He Jian, Chairman of Hunan, recently telegraphed Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong, instructing them to immediately follow the Central Government's decision on the Shaanxi-Gansu military aftermath plan and obey orders. The original text of the telegram is recorded below: "Director Yang Hucheng of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, Brother Hugong, Chairman Yu Xuezhong of Lanzhou, Brother Xiaohou, Greetings. We have read the Central Government's decision on the Shaanxi-Gansu military aftermath plan. It is comprehensive, considering both facts and principles. All fellow soldiers admire it. We respectfully request you, brothers, to uphold the past revolutionary spirit, immediately comply with and implement it, and continue to work hard. We dare to pre-wish you future meritorious achievements. Your younger brother, He Jian, with official seal." (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Fan Songfu telegraphed Yang Hucheng at the end of last month, stating, "Director Yang Hucheng of the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, Public, the unrest in Xi'an has caused social turmoil and popular anxiety. Scattered bandits are rampant. Those in power are busy coping with the situation and have no time to attend to other matters, resulting in the suffering and hardship of the people. Although political views may occasionally differ, the love for the country and the people should be consistent. You have governed Shaanxi for a long time and have deep feelings for your homeland. Seeing this great disaster, you must be deeply saddened. I respectfully request you to strictly enforce discipline and instruct all subordinates and the Northeast armies to immediately restore the original state and bring peace to our people. Because of our camaraderie, I dare to offer these presumptuous words. If they are adopted, I will be greatly relieved and pray for it." Fan Songfu, with seal. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Mayor Ma Chaojun of Nanjing, in response to the Central Government's newly promulgated order to reorganize the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu, telegraphed Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong on the 7th, hoping that they would adhere to the Central Government's intentions and handle everything appropriately. (Special dispatch of the 8th) Various groups in Jinan have decided to echo the telegram from various groups in Nanjing, supporting the Central Government's measures for the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu.

<h3>Liu Ruming Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Ke Ruming arrived in Beiping from Zhangjiakou this morning to meet with Song Zheyuan and report on the political affairs of Chahar Province. (Special dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang's Public Rights Not Yet Restored</h3>
<p>Deprivation of Public Rights Begins From the Date of Autonomy and Pardon. Retention After Removal Implies the Idea of Making Amends for Sins. Nanjing.</p>
<p>Regarding Zhang Xueliang's main sentence, after it was explicitly pardoned by the National Government, many outsiders believe that the secondary penalty also no longer exists. The reporter specially visited experts from the Criminal Law Committee of the Legislative Yuan to inquire for their opinions. According to them, Zhang's secondary penalty, the five-year deprivation of public rights, was sentenced in accordance with Article 37, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The latter part of Paragraph 4 of that article also states, "Those who are declared deprived of public rights in accordance with Paragraph 2 shall have the period counted from the date of completion of the execution or pardon of the main sentence." According to this interpretation, it is obvious that the pardon of the main sentence should still lead to the deprivation of public rights. To seek the restoration of public rights, one should separately handle the procedures for restoration of rights in the Provisional Constitution during the Period of Political Tutelage. Subsequently, the matter of retention after removal was discussed. It is said that this type of punishment method is not uncommon in the political history of our country, implying the intention of making amends for sins. However, in the future, when those subjected to this punishment submit a report to the superior official authority, the four words "Retention After Removal" should be added to their title according to old custom to show the distinction. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Remarks Upon Passing Through Singapore</h3>
<p>Saving the Nation Through Education. The Central Government Has Established a Plan. Only National Unity and Efforts Along These Lines Will Succeed.</p>
<p>[Singapore] Chairman Wang arrived in Singapore on the 6th from Europe and returned to the country on the original ship on the 7th. Before his departure, he made a statement, saying, "I was granted leave by the Central Government to recuperate, and over the past few months, I have gradually recovered. I originally planned to take a ship back to the country in mid-November of last year, but I was suddenly stricken with cholecystitis, which led to a postponement. In mid-December, I heard about the Xi'an Incident and was greatly distressed. I disembarked on the 22nd and received a telegram from Mr. Chiang on the 26th, informing me that he had safely arrived in the capital, which relieved me. Regarding the policy of saving the nation through education, the Central Government has a complete plan and definite steps. Since Mr. Chiang took over the administrative branch, the central government has been strengthened, national power has increased, and diplomatic responses have been handled appropriately. Only national unity and efforts along these lines will succeed. As for other issues, I intend to wait until I arrive in Nanjing to discuss them in detail with fellow comrades. At this time, I have no further opinions to express. Finally, regarding the assassination attempt on me, I would like to say a few words. Previously, because it concerned the judiciary and was in the process of being tried, I was unable to speak. Recently, I heard that the case has been adjudicated. I believe that I have no personal enemies in my life. In recent years, I have been in charge of administration, precisely when the nation has been facing internal and external troubles. Although I have exhausted my efforts, the hardships and twists are unknown to outsiders. If misunderstandings have led to violent acts, they may be somewhat excusable. After returning to Nanjing, I intend to request the National Government to generously pardon all those involved." (Central News Agency dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing after a brief rest in Shanghai upon arrival in Hong Kong. The Mausoleum and Wang's residence in the new residential area are being rushed for decoration. (Dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Lodges a Protest with Japan Regarding the Zhengzhou Incident</h3>
<p>The Documents Obtained are Currently Under Investigation. Liu's Chief of Staff Arrested in Zhengzhou</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Japanese ronin Yamaguchi, Shiga, Tanaka, and others secretly established a secret organization in Zhengzhou, engaging in activities. It was uncovered by a special commissioner's office in the first district.

<h3>Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Rumors Are Quite Inconsistent</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] There have been repeated reports from Japan recently that the Japanese side intends to schedule the continuation of adjustments in Sino-Japanese relations. Cable communications from Tokyo are quite inconsistent. According to observations by those familiar with the diplomatic situation, both sides are willing to proceed with adjusting Sino-Japanese relations in principle. However, with the Japanese army continuing to instigate disturbances in Suiyuan, negotiations on adjusting relations are felt to be difficult to develop. (Special dispatch of the 8th)</p>
<h3>Zou Lu Discusses Overseas Impressions</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Central Executive Committee Member Zou Lu on the morning of the 8th and was received by him, and he broadly discussed his overseas impressions and opinions on national affairs. Zou first stated that he only stayed in Germany briefly this time and did not visit other countries for observation. He will only speak about the recent situation of the German Social Democratic Party. Their progress is admirable in every respect. There are two points that are most noteworthy: 1. The success of national physical training; 2. The cultivation of a national fighting spirit. The former is indeed the foundation of national prosperity and cultural construction and is worthy of our emulation. As for the latter, the focus on fighting spirit as the center of education is inappropriate. The clashes of the left and right, two major camps, in Europe all originate from this, so it is not something we should adopt. Zou next stated that after returning to the country, he saw that the nation is tending towards revival and that signs of turning points are appearing everywhere. He cited two notable points that prove this and are very optimistic for the future: 1. The prestige of the central government and Chairman Chiang has been established, and the people of the country all admire them. Even people from various countries around the world are very impressed. 2. The people have deeply understood and recognized the spirit of hard work and the policies pursued by the government and Chairman Chiang. Therefore, in the future, we should unite all comrades within the party, strengthen the party's power, and the party should earnestly lead the people to save the country together. Then the completion of the great task of revival can be expected soon. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 8th)</p>

<h3>Amendments to the Organization Law of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission by the Legislative Yuan</h3>
<p>Amendments to Articles of the Supervisory Yuan Organization Law; Resolution Passed that the Fisheries Law Does Not Require Amendment</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan convened its 86th regular session on the morning of the 8th. 73 members, including Chuan Bingchang, were present. Sun Ke chaired the session, with Liang Hancao as Secretary-General. The following items were discussed: ㊀ A proposal to amend Article 11 of the Supervisory Yuan Organization Law was passed. ㊁ A proposal to amend the Organization Law of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission was passed. This proposal was based on the "Outline of Unified Yellow River Repair and Prevention Measures" and aimed to change the commission's powers. The key amendments are as follows: The commission is directly under the National Economic Council and is responsible for all beneficial and preventative measures related to the Yellow River and its tributaries, such as the Wei and Luo Rivers. The commission will have one chairperson and one vice-chairperson, specially appointed, and nine to eleven committee members, simply appointed. The governors of the provinces along the river will be ex officio members, jointly responsible for river defense and repair. They will assist the commission in handling matters related to the Yellow River within their respective provinces. The commission will be reorganized into three departments: General Affairs, Engineering, and River Defense. The Yellow River's course will be divided into three major sections, each with a repair and defense office, each headed by a director responsible for repair and defense. The organizational regulations will be determined by the National Economic Council. ㊂ A proposal to amend the Fisheries Law was resolved not to require amendment. This proposal arose because of the necessity of constructing fences and weirs for inland river fish farming, which often led to disputes due to Article 44 of the Fisheries Law. Local authorities found it difficult to handle such cases. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry advocated adding Article 25 after Article 24, stating that "inland river fish farms may, for the purpose of demarcating boundaries, apply to local administrative authorities for permission to construct fences or weirs, provided that they do not impede water conservancy or transportation." The Legislative Yuan considered that the intention of the proposed additional article was already covered by Article 17 of the existing law, and that the penalties stipulated in Article 44 required both the unauthorized construction of fences and the "blocking of fish passage" to be established. If fences are legally constructed to demarcate boundaries, no penalty would arise. It was deemed unnecessary to create a separate article. As for Article 40, regarding the removal, damage, or destruction of fishery markers, the Civil Code already provided for compensation for damages, so no amendment was deemed necessary. ㊃ The International Convention for the Suppression of Traffic in Adult Women was resolved to be postponed for approval. ㊄ The Convention Concerning the Use of White Lead in Painting Industry, ㊅ the Convention Concerning the Reduction of Working Hours to Forty a Week, ㊆ the Convention Concerning the Reduction of Hours of Work in the Glass-Bottle Manufacturing Industry, ㊇ the Convention Concerning Hours of Work in Coal Mines, ㊈ the Convention Concerning the Establishment of an International Scheme for the Maintenance of Rights Under Invalidity, Old-Age and Widows' and Orphans' Insurance were all resolved to be postponed for discussion. ㊉ The fourth supplementary budget for the 24th fiscal year's national ordinary revenue and expenditure was resolved to be approved as proposed. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Interpretation of Concurrent Succession by the Judicial Yuan</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Judicial Yuan hereby issues the following interpretation regarding the legality of adopted children adopting compound surnames when concurrently inheriting two lineages: Since Article 1078 of the Civil Code clearly stipulates that adopted children shall adopt the surname of the adoptive parent, adopted children may not concurrently use their original surname. If the original surname is added to the name, it can only be considered part of the given name and not a compound surname. While there is no explicit prohibition against concurrently inheriting two lineages, in accordance with the spirit of Article 1083 of the same law, it has no legal effect.

<h3>Body of English Woman Found Near German Cemetery in Beiping</h3>
<p>Somewhat Mysterious Circumstances; British Authorities Begin Investigation</p>
<p>[Beiping] Mr. Whineray, who served at the British Consulate in China, retired in 1914 and resided in Beiping. His daughter, Pamela, aged seventeen, suddenly died this morning. The circumstances are somewhat mysterious. The local police have taken notice. It is reported that her body was found at 7 a.m. this morning, about 250 yards from her residence, near the German cemetery, a very secluded area. The body had been partially devoured by wild dogs during the night, making it difficult to identify. Fortunately, her father was able to identify her by the remaining clothes. British authorities are expected to begin the investigation after receiving the results of a doctor's examination tomorrow. The cause of death is currently difficult to determine. It is said that the girl used to travel by bicycle. It is believed that she was on her way home from an ice-skating rink last night when she died. However, the bicycle is now missing. Because the area is along the city wall, several years ago, someone committed suicide near the German cemetery. To this day, local rickshaw pullers are afraid to travel there after sunset for fear of ghosts. Therefore, the body was not discovered until the next morning. It is reported that the girl's body was found in a deep ditch between the road and the city wall, where passing vehicles could not see it. Mr. Whineray only had this daughter and had been a widower for many years. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>

After the Wuhu head office finalized these measures, it not only instructed its three branches and 34 county offices to implement them, but also obtained approval from the provincial government to issue an order to all counties to provide assistance.

However, a late payment penalty of 2 per mill will be added. In special circumstances, if an extension is agreed upon with the bank, the penalty will be waived. ㊄ The collateral is limited to rice, grain, and other agricultural products. The collateral per household shall not exceed 3 dan of rice or 10 dan of grain. Other agricultural products will be subject to the same standard. ㊅ When converting collateral into loan amounts, it shall not exceed 60% of the local market price. ㊆ To reduce the burden on farmers, the collateral may be stored by the borrower, provided that a joint guarantee certificate from five households is provided and the bank verifies and seals the goods. ㊇ Borrowers must complete a loan application form, along with the guarantee certificate and a sample package of the collateral, and submit them to the bank.

<h3>Japan Adjusts Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>According to a Tokyo dispatch from the Rengo News Agency the day before yesterday, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, in order to adjust relations with the Soviet Union, has decided to invite the Soviet Ambassador to Japan to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs within days to urge progress in resolving the outstanding issues on the Manchukuo-Soviet border. The major diplomatic issues between Japan and the Soviet Union were originally two: the North Pacific fishing concession issue and the Manchukuo-Soviet border issue. The fishing treaty was signed not long ago, resolving one of the issues. Now, this border issue will be reopened for negotiations under Japan's urging. This shows that the tense Japan-Soviet relations of the past few years will gradually ease in the future.</p>
<p>However, this change in Japan-Soviet relations should not be viewed simply as a matter between Japan and the Soviet Union. It should be seen as a phenomenon in the entire Far Eastern situation. What significance does this change reflect in the development of the entire Far Eastern situation? We believe that three meanings can be found. First, Japan's attitude towards the Soviet Union has changed from eagerly provoking disputes to temporarily seeking compromise. Second, Japan is changing its Soviet foreign policy because of its current isolated diplomatic position. Third, in order to salvage the difficulty of its diplomatic isolation, Japan will not only "adjust" its relations with the Soviet Union, but also try to woo its relations with Britain and the United States to maintain the fruits of aggression it has gained in China.</p>
<p>We remember that after the signing of the Japan-Germany alliance a few months ago, the Soviet Union immediately protested to Tokyo and delayed the signing of the Japan-Soviet fishing agreement. At that time, Tokyo showed great anxiety, and Foreign Minister Arita was criticized by all parties and appeared very embarrassed. It was not until Litvinov indicated that the fishing agreement could be signed that the Japanese side turned sorrow into joy. Even the border issue, which was originally raised by the Soviet Union and repeatedly obstructed by Japan, is now being reopened for negotiations under the urging of Foreign Minister Arita. This situation shows that Japan's conciliatory attitude towards the Soviet Union is very noteworthy.</p>
<p>Japan's diplomatic isolation has become most evident in the past year. This is due to Japan's intensified advancement into North China and Inner Mongolia, which has caused common anxiety and dissatisfaction among Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France. The puppet show in eastern Hebei has aroused global ridicule, and the evil wind of armed smuggling has been criticized by various countries. Recently, the puppet bandit army, under coercion, attacked Suiyuan, and no one sympathized with them. There is now clearly some diplomatic understanding between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to jointly oppose aggressors who undermine peace in the Far East. This can be proved by the speeches of diplomatic figures from various countries. This reversal of the diplomatic situation is, of course, detectable by the Tokyo authorities. Therefore, those who originally insisted on a monolithic, tough policy now have to change their approach and conduct multifaceted wooing and compromise.</p>
<p>However, China must also pay close attention to the changes in this Far Eastern situation with great vigilance. In the past year, China has been able to adopt somewhat effective resistance to the pressure of aggressors. In addition to the exertion of our own strength, the corresponding activities in international diplomacy have, of course, played a role. We must not now allow the aggressors to regain this diplomatic advantage. While others are beginning diplomatic efforts, we should also intensify our diplomatic efforts. Do not forget the major changes in the diplomatic situation because of minor internal political issues.</p>
<h3>Surge in Japanese Imports Leads to Exchange Controls</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Implements Emergency Measures; to be Abolished by the End of July This Year</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of Finance, in order to strengthen the Foreign Exchange Control Law promulgated in August 1933, today announced a ministerial ordinance to be implemented immediately, thoroughly managing foreign exchange for import payments and other purposes. Although there has been dissatisfied reaction from various quarters in the country, the authorities have resolutely implemented it for the following reasons: First, the yen exchange rate plummeted at the end of the year, and has not rebounded since the new year. If it is not curbed, there is a tendency to become unstable. Second, due to the increase in import tariffs in the future and the huge military expenditure in the next fiscal year, it far exceeds the amount that domestic military industry production capacity can absorb, and it is bound to increase the import of foreign goods, especially the amount of military supplies is huge. Third, due to the shortage of foreign exchange funds, the Japanese government is forced to approve the priority import of military supplies, and tighten restrictions on the import of daily necessities. Although the new order of the Ministry of Finance stipulates that it will be abolished on July 31 this year, it is still doubtful whether it will be extended again when the time comes. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Minister of Finance recently issued a statement saying that the recent trend of increasing imports is quite significant. As a result, foreign exchange banks' purchases of import bills have also increased sharply. If this continues, it may have an adverse impact on the future of Japanese exchange rates. Therefore, at present, the bills for paying for imported goods must be approved by the government as a temporary emergency measure. Moreover, from the main purpose of preventing the overseas dumping of Japanese currency, the Ministry of Finance has designated a ministerial ordinance based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law to seek the stability of Japanese exchange rates and maintain the current exchange rate level. However, in the actual operation, a cautious attitude will be adopted to ensure that it does not affect industry and trade. In addition, this ministerial ordinance is a temporary emergency measure, so it is planned to broadly stop it on July 31 this year. (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>The Japanese Embassy in China today announced that the purpose of the Ministry of Finance ordinance based on the Foreign Exchange Control Law this time is to adjust in response to rising prices and the expected sharp increase in imports due to tariff revisions. It is only a temporary emergency measure and will be abolished at the end of July this year. This measure will be used to seek the stability of Japanese exchange rates and maintain the current exchange rate level. However, when this ordinance is implemented, full attention will naturally be paid to ensure that it does not cause any obstacles to Japanese commerce and trade. This ordinance will be implemented from January 8 this year. According to this ordinance, all foreign exchange transactions and the acquisition of letters of credit for the payment of goods shipped to Japan must, in principle, be approved. This ordinance has already been published in the official gazette on January 8. However, the following two or three matters that should be noted in this regard are listed as examples:</p>
<p>㊀ The term "foreign exchange transaction" in this ordinance includes the sale of Japanese currency abroad and the implementation of foreign exchange reservations agreed upon before the implementation of this ordinance. However, transactions of less than 30,000 yuan equivalent per month do not require permission.</p>
<p>㊁ Based on the letter of credit obtained before the implementation of this ordinance, permission is also required when opening a bill of exchange for the payment of goods exported from Shanghai.</p>
<p>㊂ Permission is also required when the value of goods exported from Japan without foreign exchange is used to offset the value of goods imported into Japan (Allied News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Ordinance</h3>

<p>㊃ When using the funds from goods exported without foreign exchange as payment for imported goods, government approval must be obtained.</p>
<p>㊄ Importers, in order to carry out the necessary settlement for imports, should obtain government approval to handle foreign currency securities, foreign currency deposits, foreign currency loans, etc. abroad, or to borrow money abroad using these foreign currency funds as collateral.</p>
<p>㊅ Foreign exchange banks must confirm whether their customers' foreign exchange transactions and the receipt of letters of credit are legal.</p>
<p>㊅ When a foreign exchange bank pays a bank designated overseas, the remittance check or remittance bill and the designated payment document must be approved, unless the amount is less than 10,000 yuan.</p>
<p>㊇ Those who have imported goods worth more than 500,000 yuan in Showa 11 must submit a report on the actual performance of imported goods settlement in Showa 10 and Showa 11.</p>
<p>㊈ Those who have obtained permission for the necessary transactions to settle imported goods should submit a monthly import report when importing the goods (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Finance issued the following notes on the implementation of Ministry of Finance Ordinance No. 1 of the Exchange Control Department:</p>
<p>㊀ When applying for permission for various transactions necessary for the settlement of imported goods, it should be done before ordering or signing the contract, unless there are unavoidable circumstances in the business. For imported goods for which the sales negotiations have been concluded at the time of the implementation of this ordinance, permission should be obtained as soon as possible after the implementation of this ordinance.</p>
<p>㊁ Foreign exchange banks, in order to confirm whether their customers' foreign exchange transactions and letters of credit are legal, should obtain a permission certificate from those who transact with foreign exchange banks to indicate that they are legal.</p>
<p>㊂ Regarding the items to be recorded in the application for permission, the provisions of Ministry of Finance Ordinance No. 8 of Showa 8 shall be applied mutatis mutandis. However, the transaction relationship of the import of goods, etc. must be recorded in detail. Therefore, when applying for permission, the headquarters or the Bank of Japan should be consulted first to receive instructions.</p>
<p>㊃ Those who have questions about this ordinance may go to the headquarters or the Bank of Japan to inquire about the details, and it is hoped that the general public will pay attention to avoid violating the law (Allied News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<h3>Tokyo Exchange Market Chaos</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The exchange market was very chaotic on the 8th due to the implementation of the Ministry of Finance ordinance on exchange controls. Import and export businesses find it difficult to predict the future, and transactions are congested. According to this morning's telegram, although the US-UK exchange rate has not changed, it is still $4.91 and 7/32. However, the US-Japan exchange rate has fallen by 5 cents to $0.28 and 46 cents, which is proof of the foreign market's criticism of this provincial meeting. The market quotations generally remain the same as the previous day. The selling price for US current month is $28.08 and 3/8, and the buying price opens at 16 and 7/8. The selling price for the next month is $28.16 and 5/8, and the buying price is the same at 8 and 3/8. However, a special seller recently appeared at $28.16 and 7/8, which is quite strong. The selling price for UK current month is 1 shilling 1 pence and 7/8, and the buying price is the same at 16 and 15. The selling price for the next month is 1 shilling 1 pence and 27/32, and the buying price is the same at 8 and 7/8, which is no different from the previous day. Also, the Yokohama Specie Bank's listing is unchanged for both US and UK currencies. (8th, Allied Press)</p>

<h3>US Next Year's Budget Submitted to Congress</h3>
<p>Military Spending Unprecedentedly Huge, Reconstruction and Relief Funds Also Enormous</p>
<p>[Washington] Today, President Roosevelt submitted the fiscal year budget ending June 30, 1938, to Congress, requesting an unprecedented amount of peacetime national defense spending in 1938. The construction costs of two new battleships are also included. The key points of this new budget are listed below:</p>
<p>㊀ Revenue and expenditure of the 1938 budget.</p>
<p>㊁ It is recommended to continue levying nuisance taxes at the current rate, maintain the 3-cent postage rate, and establish a Civilian Conservation Corps on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>㊂ The revenue for 1936 is announced as US$4,115,957,000, and the expenditure is US$8,879,798,000.</p>
<p>㊃ The estimated revenue for 1937 is approximately US$5,828,151,000, and the expenditure is approximately US$8,480,804,000.</p>
<p>㊄ The estimated revenue for 1938 is approximately US$7,293,607,000, and the expenditure (excluding work relief funds) is approximately US$6,158,000,000, with a surplus of US$1,135,608,000.</p>
<p>㊅ In addition to the regular budget of the Navy Department for 1938, an additional US$23,300,000 will be allocated to begin the construction of two battleships with a displacement of 35,000 tons.</p>
<p>㊆ Regulations are stipulated to enable the Navy to realize its original construction program, so that the fleet strength can be expanded to its full extent by 1942.</p>
<p>㊇ When allocating funds to the Naval Aviation Bureau, the manufacturing costs of 400 new aircraft should be included.</p>
<p>㊈ It is recommended that the expenditure of the Army's expenses should be increased by US$16,000,000 compared to the 1937 budget.</p>
<p>㊉ The minimum number of new aircraft required by the Army in 1938 should be 530.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt continued that the 1938 budget is balanced in revenue and expenditure. In addition to reducing debt by US$401,515,000, an additional US$1,537,123,000 will be allocated for reconstruction and relief. If the progress of the economic situation can continue to be maintained at the current rate, we can expect to obtain a fully balanced budget in 1939, and have sufficient funds to meet the statutory needs and debt reduction. President Roosevelt advocated continuing to implement the so-called nuisance tax at the current rate, maintaining the US$0.03 stamp rate, and establishing a Civilian Conservation Corps on a permanent basis.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt informed Congress that the total revenue for the 1936 fiscal year was US$4,115,957,000 and the total expenditure was US$8,879,798,000. The shortfall was due to the Supreme Court's recognition of the business tax as illegal and the increase in the endowment to veterans due to Congress' insistence.</p>
<p>The estimated revenue for the 1937 fiscal year is US$5,828,151,000 and the estimated expenditure is US$8,480,804,000, including US$790,000,000, which will soon be requested from Congress to continue the work relief program from February 1 to June 30. At the end of the current fiscal year, the gross public debt will be approximately US$35,026,000,000, an increase of US$1,248,000,000 compared to 1936.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt did not request to revise the tax rate for unpaid bonuses in the 1928 fiscal year, saying that it must be possible to achieve this goal based on the phenomenon.</p>
<p>The estimated expenditure for the 1938 budget, excluding work relief funds, is US$6,158,000,000. National defense spending increased by US$27,000,000, reaching an unprecedented peacetime figure of US$991,600,000. The estimated revenue is US$7,293,607,000, which is more than the previous year, mostly due to the improvement of commerce, the abundant harvest of income tax, and the implementation of the 1936 tax law. There are no regulations for work relief funds, but including the necessary funds for debt repayment, there is still a surplus of US$1,135,608,000.</p>
<p>The various programs that have been implemented in the past four years will require huge amounts of money, but the benefits obtained are far greater than the costs.</p>
<p>Since 1933, the commercial situation has shown significant progress every year compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>The total amount of peacetime national defense spending requested by President Roosevelt for 1938 is unprecedentedly huge, including the construction costs of two new battleships. Therefore, the shipbuilding action will be consistent with the United Kingdom. Both ships are 35,000 tons, and the cost of each ship is approximately US$50 million. For the purpose of starting shipbuilding, President Roosevelt has increased the originally planned budget of the Navy Department for 1938 from US$563,996,000 to US$587,302,000. The goal of the Navy's shipbuilding program is to expand the strength of the fleet to its full extent and to complete it in 1942. In addition to the regulations implemented in stages, President Roosevelt intends to allocate US$49,500,000 to the Naval Aviation Bureau, of which US$28,000,000 will be used to increase the number of new aircraft by 400. According to the funds approved in 1927, this amount is US$27,000,000.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt requested that US$393,460,000 be used for various Army items, which is approximately US$16,000,000 more than the 1937 budget, of which US$37,435,000 is for the purchase of new aircraft, which is approximately US$4,000,000 more than the 1937 figure. According to the Army's plan, at least 530 new aircraft must be added in 1938, which is the same as the number specified in the 1937 budget. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>British Commercial Progress with China</h3>

<h3>German Social Democratic Party's Anniversary in Power</h3>
<p>Hitler to Elaborate on Political Achievements</p>
<p>[Berlin] January 30th is the fourth anniversary of the German leader Hitler's assumption of power entrusted by the late President von Hindenburg. Hitler has scheduled a meeting of the House of Representatives on that day. The political circles believe that this meeting will only discuss domestic affairs. At that time, Hitler will issue a declaration, describing his work in the past four years, and may apply for continued possession of full power for some time. According to a solemn statement from the authorities, there will be no changes to Germany's constitution and cabinet organization. Rumors from outside that Hitler intends to resign from the post of Prime Minister and only retain his position as leader have been denied by the semi-official side.</p>
<p>[Berlin] A Paris newspaper carried news that the German leader Hitler is now seeking to add a title equal to that of Emperor as soon as possible. Berlin today made a semi-official denial of this, using strong language, saying that the newspapers are competing to publish this kind of unconscious rumors, completely disregarding their own political credibility.

<h3>Italy Still Intends to Cooperate with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Executive Yuan Convenes on the 18th of This Month</p>
<p>[Geneva] It is generally believed that when the Executive Yuan of the League of Nations holds its regular meeting on the 18th of this month, the British representative will submit a report on the details of the gentleman's agreement between the United Kingdom and Italy. At that time, Italy will also send representatives to attend. Since the League of Nations General Assembly implemented sanctions in November 1934, this will be the first time that Italian representatives have re-attended the Executive Yuan meeting. League of Nations officials recently announced that the League of Nations General Assembly will hold a temporary meeting at the end of this month to accept Egypt as a member state. At the same time, due to the fact that Italian troops in Abyssinia have occupied the Ghor region, the last remaining independent government of Abyssinia has been eliminated. Therefore, it will refuse to allow the Abyssinian delegation to attend. If Ghor is the case, cooperation between Italy and the League of Nations will no longer be hindered. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Pope's Condition Improves</h3>

It is heard that although the Pope feels mentally exhausted for the time being, his thoughts are still very active. (7th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The Battle for Madrid Enters the Final Critical Moment</h3>
<p>German and Moroccan Troops Assist in the Fierce Offensive, Key Towns in the Northwest Suburbs of the Capital are Occupied</p>
<p>Madrid The Madrid Defense Committee issued a bulletin today, stating that the battle between the government forces and the national army for the city has entered a critical moment. Fierce battles took place in the areas of Pozuelo, de Alarcón, El Plantío, and Las Rozas yesterday, day and night. German and Moroccan troops, under the cover of a large number of tanks, launched a fierce attack on the government forces' front line. The government forces guarded the trenches and fought back with all their might, causing heavy casualties to the national army, especially near Las Rozas. At the same time, the various newspapers belonging to the government have begun to urge the citizens of Madrid to leave the country quickly. Major Carlos, the political commissar of the Fifth Battalion, today advocated that the government forces be unified under one command, so that military power can be unified to cope with the overall situation. He solemnly stated that women and children and all people who cannot directly or indirectly participate in the war should leave the country as soon as possible to avoid being detrimental to the war. (7th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Ávila Our correspondent, Tao Sibida, reports that the government forces in the city of Madrid launched a fierce attack on the area of the Gasategamba Park in the western suburbs before dawn yesterday. The two sides fought hand-to-hand with bayonets for an hour. When the east began to whiten, the government forces finally could not withstand it and retreated. Until 9:00 a.m., the national army also began to attack from the battle area in the early morning, first using artillery to bombard the government forces' positions, and then using infantry to charge. Although the government forces fought bravely, the national army still won victory after victory. By noon, all targets had been captured. For example, the villages of Pozuelo, Xumera, Cruz Garlo, Valde Gómez, and Bertigona in the northwestern suburbs have all fallen into the hands of the national army one after another. A staff officer of the national army recently made a statement to our correspondent, "Our army has won a great victory in the northwestern suburbs of Madrid. Although this battle was extremely fierce, the victory of this battle was truly unexpected." (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] "Le Journal" recently published a report from Berlin, stating that the German authorities have now decided to actively assist the Spanish National Army together with Italy, so as to achieve victory within two months. In recent days, a large number of military supplies have been transported to Spain, and special teams from the garrisons in Rubin, Leonburg, and Elzengot have also gone to assist the National Army in the battle. Troops have also been sent from Munich. German sources here say that those who went to Spain are only volunteers, not formal troops. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Suggest Germany and Italy Submit Replies</h3>
<p>Approve the Principle of Stopping the Sending of Volunteer Soldiers, Attaching Three Conditions with the Intention of Delaying</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German government submitted a reply to the British and French ambassadors in Berlin last night regarding the proposal of Britain and France on December 23 on non-interference in the Spanish civil war. The reply contains three conditions for cooperation in continuing non-interference in the Spanish civil war, namely: ㊀ All other nine countries involved should take the same attitude towards non-interference; ㊁ The issue of indirect non-interference should also be dealt with immediately; ㊂ The governments of all participating countries should agree to unconditional and effective supervision of the agreed-upon ban, and this supervision should be implemented on the spot. The reply also advocated that non-Spanish participants in the Spanish war, including political activists and propagandists, should all be ordered to leave the country. The reply expressed surprise that the British and French governments directly appealed to the governments participating in the committee while the Non-Intervention Committee was meeting to discuss the prohibition of volunteer soldiers going to Spain, saying that if they believed that the procedures of the committee were not appropriate, they should stop these procedures. It also said that the Italian and German governments had requested from the beginning to prohibit foreign volunteer soldiers from participating in the Spanish civil war, but the British and French governments did not agree at that time. The reply also stated that this ban must prevent its results from becoming a unilateral support for anti-French elements, and only benefit the Spanish Bolshevik Party, because the strength of the party has been greatly consolidated by obtaining the assistance of foreign volunteer teams. However, Germany is very willing to support all plans to prevent the continuous flow of volunteer teams into Spain, in order to completely eliminate the possibility of direct and indirect interference in the Spanish civil war. At this point in the reply, the above three conditions were listed, followed by the statement that if no method can be agreed upon to curb other forms of indirect interference, the German government will reserve the right to re-study its attitude towards the volunteer team issue. According to a message from the German News Agency, the German government's reply was drafted after consultation with the Italian government, so the Italian government's reply will be the same in substance as the German reply. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the proposal by the United Kingdom and France to prohibit volunteer soldiers from going to Spain to serve, the Italian government's reply has just been published, stating that Italy accepts the proposal to prohibit volunteer soldiers from going to Spain in principle, but with the following conditions: ㊀ The countries concerned should adopt the same attitude; ㊁ Effective supervision should be implemented at the Spanish border entry points; ㊂ The Italian government firmly believes that the methods currently adopted by the London Adjustment Committee are ineffective and should be abandoned, because the issue of non-interference in the Spanish civil war should be discussed as a whole for both direct and indirect interference. The Italian government made this proposal in the early stages. Therefore, the Italian government expects that other issues regarding interference in the Spanish civil war, such as raising funds to support both parties involved in the civil war, will be resolved in the same way as the issue of prohibiting volunteer soldiers. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>German Claim</h3>
<p>Claiming to Be Extremely Just</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding Germany's reply to the proposal of the United Kingdom and France to prohibit volunteer soldiers from going to Spain, political figures recently expressed their views, saying that Germany's reply is consistent with the attitude adopted by Germany and Italy from the beginning. An investigation shows that Germany and Italy have always opposed direct or indirect interference in the Spanish civil war in any way. In the future, if the efforts of Germany and Italy fail, the blame will not lie with the two countries. Political figures also said that the purpose of the recommendations in the German reply is to limit the scope of the Spanish war and prevent it from expanding to involve other countries. All countries should recognize that the claims of Germany and Italy are indeed just and should be supported. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>British and French Views</h3>
<p>German Conditions are Difficult to Implement, but the Door to Negotiations is Not Closed</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the prohibition of volunteer soldiers from going to Spain, responsible parties recently expressed their views after receiving the replies from Germany and Italy, saying that the British and French governments, in view of the unusually tense international situation, took joint action to eliminate the problem before it took shape. Judging from the replies of Germany and Italy, it can be seen that this attempt by Britain and France has achieved initial success. Although the German reply believes that the current prohibition of volunteer soldiers from going to Spain is unfavorable to the National Army, it still accepts the proposal of Britain and France in principle. Therefore, the way to solve the volunteer soldier problem is not closed because of this. It is estimated that the British government will renegotiate with the governments of the countries concerned in the shortest possible time in order to take concrete measures to promote the implementation of the proposals of Britain and France. (7th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the prohibition of volunteer soldiers from going to Spain, responsible persons here need to comment on the German reply, saying that the German reply has not completely denied the proposals made by Britain and France. Therefore, negotiations on the issue of prohibiting volunteer soldiers can still continue, and the international tension has also been eased because of this. As for a certain condition mentioned in the German reply, responsible persons all believe that it is difficult to implement. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Germany's Ultimatum Expires, Spanish Government Still Has No Reply</h3>
<p>Germany Freely Disposes of Seized Spanish Ships, Believing This Incident Has Ended</p>
<p>[Berlin] The deadline for Germany's ultimatum to Spain has expired, but the Valencia government's ultimatum, although at 8:00 a.m. this morning regarding whether to release a portion of the cargo and one passenger on the detained German ship "Palos", has remained silent to this day. In view of the Spanish government's lack of reply, Germany believes that it has no sincerity in considering Germany's request. Therefore, it is prepared to detain the two intercepted Spanish ships. The significance of Germany's move is probably to hand over the two ships to the Spanish National Army government as compensation for the cargo detained on the "Palos" and to console the families of the detained Spanish passengers. It is heard that after the above measures are implemented, Germany will consider this accident to have ended. If Spain no longer violates German ships, Germany will no longer take retaliatory action.

<h3>Local Disputes</h3>
<p>Turkey Denies Troop Concentration on Syrian Border; France Favors Diplomatic Solution</p>
<p>[Ankara] Today, responsible authorities here denied rumors that Turkish troops were concentrating on the Turkish-Syrian border. Turkish President Kemal Atatürk suddenly went to Konya in southern Anatolia, near the French Syrian border, on the 6th of this month and is expected to return to the capital in two or three days. He met with key local officials there to discuss the overall situation. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the issue of Alexandretta and Antioch, currently under negotiation between France and Turkey, League of Nations circles believe that the League's Administrative Council will hold a meeting soon. Before the Administrative Council discusses the issue, Turkey will not actually withdraw from the League of Nations, nor will it take drastic political or military decisions. However, if the outcome of the Administrative Council's discussion is not satisfactory to Turkey, the country may change its attitude. Turkish sources say that President Kemal Atatürk has now decided not to allow the Turks in Alexandretta and Antioch to be governed jointly with the Arab Syrians. Therefore, the Turkish delegation will propose the establishment of a federal state when the League of Nations Administrative Council meets, comprising three autonomous states: (1) the Autonomous State of Syria, (2) the Autonomous State of Lebanon, and (3) the Autonomous State of Alexandretta and Antioch, all jointly guaranteed by France and Turkey. However, the autonomous state formed by Alexandretta and Antioch should become a demilitarized zone. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>[Ankara] Government spokesman Falih Rifki recently published an article in the press commenting on the issue of Alexandretta and Antioch, stating, "This issue was initially a legal issue, but it has now become a matter of the sacred responsibility of the Turkish Republic and the Turkish nation. France can resolve this matter slowly, but Turkey cannot wait any longer." The current ambiguous status of Alexandretta and Antioch is something Turkey cannot allow to remain unchanged indefinitely. In short, the residents of both cities should have the right to self-determination; this is the crux of the matter. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Deputy Foreign Minister Vienot met with Turkish Ambassador Suad at 6 p.m. to discuss the issue of Turkish minorities in Alexandretta and Antioch for two hours. According to responsible sources, the recent articles published in Turkish newspapers have been quite aggressive. Vienot explained to the Turkish ambassador that this could affect the possibility of France and Turkey reaching an agreement on the issue of Alexandretta and Antioch. He also stated that the French government is currently carefully studying the issue and hopes that the Turkish government will also consider it carefully. If Turkey agrees to postpone the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting (originally scheduled for the 18th of this month) so that French-Turkish negotiations can continue, the French government can request that the Administrative Council postpone the meeting. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>[Paris] A Foreign Ministry spokesman stated today that France currently has a total of 30,000 troops stationed in its white colony in Syria, which is sufficient to deal with any eventuality, but hopes that there will be no trouble. (Guomin News Agency, 7th)</p>

<h3>Fujian Province's Economic Construction Plan for This Year</h3>
<p>Chen Yi Publishes Speech on Grain Self-Sufficiency Plan</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Fujian Province is located in the subtropics. Except for a small portion of the plains along the coast, almost the entire province is mountainous. Of the province's total area of more than 170 million mu, only more than 20 million mu are available for agricultural cultivation, less than 12 percent. The annual production is 30 to 40 million dan of grain, 30 to 40 million dan of sweet potatoes, and more than 3 million dan of wheat, which together are only enough to feed the entire province for eight or nine months. As for clothing materials, there is no cotton or wool. Food and clothing must rely on others. Fortunately, there are many mountains that can be afforested for planting fruit trees, tea, and bamboo. Bamboo can produce bamboo shoots and can also be used for papermaking. Therefore, the province can produce tea worth more than 10 million yuan, timber worth 7 to 8 million yuan, and local paper worth 6 to 7 million yuan annually, as well as bamboo shoots and fruits worth several million yuan. These products, plus some sporadic local products, are exported to other provinces or foreign countries annually, worth a total of 30 to 40 million yuan. However, the province needs to import goods from outside, which are twice as much as the province's exports, about 70 to 80 million yuan, half of which is food and clothing. Therefore, the province has a huge trade deficit every year. Although overseas remittances are about 40 million yuan per year, because in the past there was no way to use them in the province, in addition to balancing the province's foreign exchange receipts and payments, it can be said that it has little benefit to the province's economic situation. The provincial government has now designated this year as the province's economic construction year. The purpose is: (1) To supply the people's daily necessities as much as possible by utilizing the province's material production and reduce the import of luxury goods. (2) To improve and develop the province's special products and products with abundant output in order to increase exports. Regarding the first item, the province should first seek to be self-sufficient in grain. Regarding the second item, the province should first select the most important special products to promote the sales channels in the external markets to increase the purchasing power of the Fujian people abroad in exchange for other necessary goods. The speech on the grain self-sufficiency plan in the economic construction year published by Provincial Chairman Chen Yi is transcribed as follows: (1) Reclamation of wasteland: If Fujian Province wants to achieve self-sufficiency in grain, the most urgent task is to reclaim wasteland. If the reclamation of wasteland increases the cultivated land by one-tenth, then one or two months of grain can be produced each year, and the problem of insufficient grain in the province can be partially solved. However, the method of reclamation is not simple. How to gather farmers, organize land, raise capital, and apply technology all need to be studied. Generally, the method of land reclamation can be divided into three types: one is publicly owned and publicly operated, the second is publicly owned and community-operated, and the third is publicly owned and privately operated or privately owned and privately operated. Which of these three methods is appropriate needs to be tested by facts. The province plans to first designate two areas to test the two methods of publicly owned and publicly operated and publicly owned and community-operated. After the operation is successful, it will be promoted to various places. (2) Improving agricultural technology (such as seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, agricultural tools, agricultural product manufacturing, livestock improvement, etc.): The province is currently preparing three tasks for the improvement of agricultural technology: one is research. The province has established several farms and several agricultural schools to engage in this work. However, this kind of work requires a long time. In order to concentrate talents and resources, the province plans to set up a complete experimental farm this year as the center for the province's research on agricultural technology. If financial resources permit, this will be used as the basis to expand into an agricultural university. The second is promotion. If the improved agricultural technology cannot be commonly accepted and utilized by farmers, it will not help the improvement of agriculture. Therefore, promoting new technologies is as important as research. Last year, the province established a farmer teacher training class, the purpose of which is to train teachers who educate farmers to impart new technologies to farmers. The province will take the farmer teacher training school as the center for promoting new agricultural technologies. Starting from the second half of this year, it is planned to have 20 counties set up farmer vocational supplementary schools. Each school will have a large farm. The students will be recruited from local young farmers and will graduate in one year. They will attend classes on the one hand and cultivate on the other hand. The income from cultivation will belong to them. In the future, this kind of supplementary school will be gradually promoted throughout the province. If the province has 62 schools, each school graduates 100 people per year, then there will be 6,200 people per year, and more than 30,000 new farmers in five years. After training so many new farmers, it is necessary to set up factories for manufacturing agricultural tools and fertilizers to produce the things needed for new agriculture to supply the farmers' use, and the agricultural revolution within agriculture can start from this. The third is application. We want to guide farmers to organize various cooperatives to apply various new technologies, that is, to take farmers' cooperatives as the center for applying new technologies. In addition, there are two things we should especially advocate: (1) Pay attention to irrigation and improve farmland water conservancy, such as building gates, dredging rivers, digging ditches, building dikes, etc., to protect farmland and prevent water and drought disasters. We should universally advocate that farmers do it. (2) Promote animal husbandry. Animal husbandry is a rural sideline, and attention should be paid to improvement. The provincial government has now started to improve chickens, ducks, pigs, sheep, etc. As for cattle, horses, and donkeys, they are not only agricultural and transportation tools in peacetime, but also very important for national defense. However, the breeds of horses and donkeys in the province are not good. How to improve them should be studied. As for agricultural education, it is certainly a necessary tool for improving agricultural technology. The province's agricultural education is planned to be divided into two types: (1) Farmer education, the purpose of which is to train farmers who can apply new agricultural technologies. (2) Agricultural professional education, the purpose of which is to train high-level agricultural technical talents. For example, primary agricultural vocational schools, whose students are too young and have low scientific knowledge, cannot be a farmer or a technician after graduation. These schools are planned to be closed down in the future. (3) Managing grain: The grain problem is a production problem on the one hand and a distribution problem on the other hand. The amount of rice consumed in the province each year is about 35 million dan, of which more than 28 million dan are produced in the province, and the rest is imported from outside. This insufficient amount can be solved if the above-mentioned wasteland reclamation and agricultural technology improvement are effective. However, it is still necessary to have proper distribution, so that the contradiction between low grain prices hurting farmers and rice shortages will not occur in the province at the same time. Therefore, grain management is a necessary work for regulating grain. In the future, in addition to finding ways to improve distribution methods to reduce distribution costs, we will ensure that all parts of the province can buy the same amount of rice at almost the same price throughout the year. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to implement price control, set a minimum price to protect producers, and set a maximum price to protect consumers. In addition, the government should also set up warehouses for unlimited purchase or sale to regulate the relationship between supply and demand. (January 6)</p>
<h3>Xiamen Cancels Overseas Emigration Water Police Subsidy Fee</h3>
<p>Provincial Government Telegram Orders Cancellation from New Year's Day This Year; Overseas Chinese Are Very Pleased to Be Exempted from Harsh Taxes</p>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The Second Brigade Headquarters of the Fujian Water Police stationed in Xiamen, after consulting with the local inn industry last summer, collected a water police subsidy fee of 50 cents per person from overseas Chinese when selling ship tickets at the inn, on the grounds of building electric boats to consolidate coastal defense and remitted to the Second Brigade Headquarters of the Water Police. The collection started in September last autumn. It was originally scheduled to be temporarily collected for six months. In December last year, in order to unify the province's tax revenue, the provincial government ordered the subsidy fee to be transferred to the Xiamen Municipal Government Finance Bureau for direct collection, which was designated as a local tax. The inn industry was unwilling to collect the fee on behalf of the government, and presented a request to the Finance Bureau to transfer the matter to the provincial government for cancellation on the grounds that it could not allow overseas Chinese to bear this fee for a long time. The Finance Bureau then sent police to board ships to collect the fee directly from overseas Chinese, which was quite harsh. However, on January 5 of this year, the Xiamen Municipal Government received a telegram order from the provincial government, which stated, "The water police subsidy fee for Nanyang ship tickets is approved to be cancelled from January 1, 1937." After receiving the order, the Municipal Government immediately ordered the Finance Bureau to handle the matter accordingly and issue a notice by the Municipal Government to inform the public. Most of the overseas Chinese from southern Fujian are laborers. Because there is no work to be done in China, they pawn their belongings to pay for travel expenses and go abroad to make a living. The fees for ship tickets, passports, and vaccinations are already a heavy burden. They have long complained about this additional illegal subsidy fee, but no one has appealed for them, and they cannot obtain the qualifications of overseas Chinese before their departure, so they have to pay with resentment. Now that they have been exempted from the fee, they all feel relieved. (January 6)</p>
<h3>Verdict on Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang's Case of Endangering the Republic of China (Continued)</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Seven Years of Imprisonment and Deprived of Public Rights for Seven Years</p>
<p>(B) Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, Liu Shurong, Xiang Zhonglin, Li Huaicheng, and Lu Qingqi were charged with colluding with traitors to plot to disrupt public order and attempted murder for the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. The crime under Article 1, Paragraph 3 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Endangering the Republic of China has three constituent elements: (1) There must be the purpose of endangering the Republic of China. (2) There must be an act of colluding with traitors. (3) There must be a plot to disrupt public order. The element of plotting to disrupt public order requires a concrete plan for how to disrupt local public order. According to the facts alleged by the prosecutor, "The defendants Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang were instructed by Wang Yaqiao, Hua Kezhi, and others, who are at large, to come to Beijing to organize the Chenguang News Agency as a cover for assassinating key central figures. They also recruited Liu Shurong to come to Beijing to help with news interviews and participate in confidential matters. In October 1934, they began to issue manuscripts. At that time, Hua Kezhi received a six-round revolver from Wang Yaqiao and hid it at Zhang Biquan's house. In December of the same year, the Central Government held the Wang Zhongquan Meeting. Zhang Yuhua and He Puguang sent Sun Fengming to the Central Party Headquarters to attempt to assassinate Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, but the attempt failed. Later, they hid the gun at Lu Qingqi's house and then took it back. In August 1935, President Wang Jingwei resigned. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek flew to Beijing from Wuhan. He Puguang accompanied Sun Fengming to the airport to carry out the assassination, but it failed because they did not meet Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Later, the agency's funds ran out. Hua and Zhang recruited Xiang Zhonglin to come to Beijing to engage in activities to subsidize the agency. Xiang's old friend Li Huaicheng often came to chat and also heard the secrets. On November 1 of the same year, the Central Government held the Sixth Plenary Session. Several days before the meeting, around October 20 of the same year, Hua Kezhi brought Sun Fengming to Beijing to discuss with Zhang He and others and decided to take action when taking photos after the opening of the Sixth Plenary Session. Because the previous two failures were due to focusing on Chairman Chiang Kai-shek alone, they decided to first target Chiang, then Wang. If both failed, they would create a big disturbance (according to Zhang Yuhua, that is, indiscriminate firing in the venue). Fearing that Sun Fengming, who was in charge of the implementation, would have unstable will and temporary negligence, Hua Kezhi initiated a talk on the evening of the 28th of the same month. Hua Zhang He Liu Xiang Li and Sun were all present. Except for Liu, who did not speak, the others gave Sun guidance or encouragement. Sun promised to stay and not return for the time being. Xiang and He found a way to obtain a reporter's entry and exit permit and handed it to Sun Fengming for admission, which led to the incident on November 1 of last year. This court found that the defendants Zhang Yuhua and others listened to Wang Yaqiao, Hua Kezhi, and others to come to Beijing to organize the Chenguang News Agency as a cover for assassinating key central figures, how they allocated work, how they hid weapons, how they obtained entry and exit permits, how they encouraged implementation, and how they accompanied the assassin to enter the venue to assassinate. The details of the circumstances have been repeatedly stated by the defendants in the police headquarters and in the investigation of this court. Their criminal suspicion must not be said to be insignificant. Zhang Yuhua, He Puguang, and others argued that because they had misunderstood the authorities' diplomatic policy and were motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, they had planned to assassinate key figures and had no intention of endangering the Republic of China or colluding with traitors. Whether their confessions are credible is not known. However, the defendants had all fled Beijing before the incident occurred, leaving only the murderer Sun Fengming alone, carrying a six-round revolver with five bullets into the venue. Whether it was intentional or unintentional firing, it was not enough to cause a sudden disruption of local public order. Even if Zhang Yuhua had said "If the assassination fails, create a big disturbance" when talking with Hua He Sun in the Chenguang News Agency several days before the incident, it was only an expression of Zhang Yuhua's personal intention. The people present at the time did not have any plans or resolutions on how to prepare for the implementation of the disturbance (see pages 106, 108, and 111 of the Police Headquarters Investigation File and page 30 of the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Investigation File), so it is difficult to say that there was any situation of plotting to disrupt public order. If the defendants conspired in advance or participated in part of the work in Sun Fengming's assassination of key central figures, in addition to complying with the provisions of Article 270-1, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Law, it does not meet the requirements of the aforementioned crime of endangering the Republic of China. The first instance of the crime in Article 271 of the Criminal Law is under the jurisdiction of the local government, and this court is not convenient to make a substantive judgment. According to the provisions of Article 246 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a judgment of jurisdictional error is made, and a transfer to the Capital District Court with jurisdiction is made at the same time.</p>
<p>Based on the above conclusions, according to Article 291 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 6 and Article 10 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Endangering the Republic of China, Article 28, Article 37, Paragraph 2, Article 38, Paragraph 3, Section 1, Section 2, Article 40 of the Criminal Law, and Article 296 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the judgment is made as in the main text.</p>
<p>This case was executed by Luo Renji, the prosecutor of this court, performing the duties of the prosecutor. December 31, 1936, Republic of China.</p>
<p>Wu Yuheng, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Court of the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, Judge Xuan Kai, Judge Si Wen, the right certificate is the same as the original, Liu Suize, Clerk of the Fifth Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, January 5, 1937, Republic of China.</p>
<p>If the parties are dissatisfied with this judgment, they should file an appeal to this court within ten days from the day after the judgment is served, with a written statement stating the reasons for dissatisfaction. (End)</p>

<p>Sports News</p>
<h3>Director Wang Discusses Plans to Promote National Sports</h3>
<p>Training Physical Education Teachers in Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou This Summer</p>
<p>(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th) Regarding the Ministry of Education's recent plans to promote national sports, Director Wang issued the following statement on the 8th, briefly stating that the Ministry has always attached great importance to promoting national sports. The matters that are urgently planned for implementation include: ㊀ Enhancing extracurricular sports activities in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools. The method is to designate morning and after 3:00 PM as extracurricular sports time, and to prescribe sports activities, duration, based on the age, gender, physical strength differences of students at each level of school. Each person should have at least one and a half to two hours of extracurricular exercise per day, and all students should be required to participate in the exercise. ㊁ Training physical education teachers, which is the basic work for improving the level of physical education in schools. Furthermore, since the promotion of physical education should start from elementary schools, elementary school teachers should be able to teach physical education courses concurrently. Attention should be paid to the physical education training of normal school students while they are in school, in order to ensure that normal school students have good physical education training. Therefore, appropriate training should first be implemented for the physical education teachers of normal schools. The training period is planned to begin this summer, simultaneously in Beijing, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou, for a period of approximately three months or more. ㊂ Issuing a general order to all provinces and cities to establish full-time physical education supervisors and physical education sections. In view of the fact that students at all levels of schools are often unable to participate in sports universally, and that some schools pay attention to the athlete system, neglecting the physical fitness of the majority of students, which is not the way to promote popular sports. A method for group competitions is being drafted, and a few schools will be designated for experimentation first, and the results will be promoted nationwide. The detailed provisions of the method are currently being drafted.</p>
<h3>Ding Mingyi's Skills Improve, Almost Surpassing Billiard King Medina</h3>
<p>Losing by Only Fourteen Points Out of Three Hundred Points - A Wonderful Scene in the Sino-Portuguese League</p>
<p>Ding Mingyi, the main player of the Chinese Youth Association, performed well yesterday, almost overwhelming Medina, the leader of the Portuguese team. It was a wonderful scene in the fourth week of the Sino-Portuguese clash in the Shanghai Amateur Billiards Team League. The Chinese Youth Association lost to Portugal by only thirty-two points, due to the significant loss of the fifth player, Yi De, and the near victory but ultimate defeat of the third player, Zhu Qiliang. As for Mingyi's loss of fourteen points to Medina, it was considered an unexpected stroke of luck. However, when calculating the scores of each team, the Chinese Youth Association still scored more than Portugal. This small setback has little impact on the future of the league leaders.</p>
<p>After the fifth round, Ding Mingyi scored thirty-one points with one shot, twenty-one points with the next, and twenty-one points with the next, leading with seventy-three to forty-four. At that time, the goddess of luck repeatedly visited, and unexpected gains occurred one after another. The spectators were delighted, and Medina was stunned. The highest difference was Ding Mingyi at two hundred and twenty-five and Medina at one hundred. How strange! At that time, Ding's score stopped progressing, while Medina showed his magic with every shot, scoring twenty-three, sixty-three, twenty-one, and after twenty, adding another shot of twenty-four, surpassing with two hundred and ninety-four to two hundred and eighty-one, almost reaching three hundred points. Ding Mingyi then lost fourteen points with a total of two hundred and eighty-six. The result of the five rounds was that Portugal won by thirty-two points. The highest records were Medina at twenty-two, twenty-three, sixty-three, twenty-one, twenty, and twenty-four; Ding Mingyi at thirty-one, twenty-one, twenty-one, thirty-six, twenty-four, and twenty-two.</p>
<h3>Western Youth Basketball</h3>
<p>Hornets Lose to Mai Lingjia, Xintong Fortunate to Win Against Mai Lingyi</p>
<p>There were three Western Youth basketball games last night. In the first game, the Western Youth Brave team forfeited in the ordinary group, and the Tax College won without effort. In the second game, the Hornet fought against Mai Lingjia in the independent group. The Hornets were initially very impressive, leading twice at ten to six and fifteen to fourteen. However, within three minutes of the break, Locke of Mai Ling scored six goals in a row, reversing the score to twenty-six to fifteen. The Hornets never recovered after this. After the resumption of the game, they continued to lose points, and were eventually defeated with a score of fifty-eight to twenty-nine. In the final game, Xintong played against Mai Lingyi. Carson, Shi Guia, Lan Yin, and Lan Jin all played for Xintong. Mai Ling was initially sharp, staying within one or two points, and once led with sixteen to ten. The Xintong basket was often harassed, and Mai Ling led with eighteen to twelve at the end of the first half. After the resumption of the game, Xintong still did not show any improvement, leading with twenty-one to fourteen, still seven points ahead. Although Lan Yin scored, Mai Ling tied the score at twenty-three to sixteen. Lan Yin used his old tricks, first serving under the basket and making consecutive contributions, finally surpassing with twenty-four to twenty-three. As time ran out, the game ended in a stalemate, with Xintong fortunately winning by thirty-four to twenty-seven. There are five games today, starting at 4:00 PM. The ordinary group accounts for four of them, and one is the university group game between Nanjing University and St. John's University, which should be very exciting.</p>
<h3>Donghua Reserve Team Fights Two Battles in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Donghua Reserve Team made a trip to the capital on New Year's Day and fought two battles, winning one and drawing one. After the game, some of the team members rushed back on the 3rd to participate in the A-group league match against Jinan University. The detailed details of the two matches in Nanjing have already been disclosed by the Nanjing side. We are now publishing them as a supplement.</p>
<p>Versus Mixed Team</p>
<p>On January 1st, 1937, the Donghua Reserve Team played its first match against the Nanjing Mixed Team at the Jinling University field. The time was 3:30 PM, and the referee was Xu Shaowu. Although Donghua had just removed its armor after a long journey, it still won by a large margin of four to zero. No less than 5,000 people came to watch the game. In the first half, Jia Jiliang and Luo Haiguang each scored a goal, leading by two to zero. In the second half, Jia and Wu Binghao each scored two more goals, resulting in a final score of four to zero. The defenders Li Yichen, Ding Zhaocheng, and Jin Jiabiao were the most meritorious, saving dangerous balls many times, which cannot be ignored. The Nanjing team was a collection of the elite of the capital, and although they suffered defeat, they cannot be said to be incompetent. The starting lineups of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Versus Jinling</p>
<p>The second game was against the Jinling University and Middle School Mixed Team, with referee Ni Zeshun. There were even more spectators than yesterday, because Jinling gathered the strength of both the university and middle school departments, which was much stronger than the Nanjing Mixed Team. Its university department defeated St. John's University of Shanghai five to zero last winter, and its middle school department won the Jiangzhe Private Middle School Football Championship last winter. Five minutes after the start of the game, Jinling's offensive was extremely strong, and Donghua's goal was overwhelmed. Both sides played brilliantly, earning a lot of applause. Until the first half was about to end, Donghua's right winger Wen Zhihao crossed the ball, and Jinling's He Homin inadvertently scored an own goal, leading by one goal to end the half. In the second half, Jinling's inside defender Wang Binsheng committed a foul, and Luo Haiguang lightly scored a penalty kick, giving Donghua a two-goal lead and a powerful momentum. Unexpectedly, with only minutes remaining, Wang Jiasheng saved a high ball, and Jinling's He Xuequan tripped and was injured, allowing Jinling's Yu Helong to open the scoring, making it two to one. Jinling's momentum was greatly boosted, and the cheers were like thunder. Soon, Jinling's He Xuequan received assistance from Deng Yunsen and created a two-to-two draw to end the game. The best performers that day were Li Yichen, and the central defenders Jin Ding and Shu were also good. Jia Jiliang was worse than the previous day. Wen Zhihao, Luo Haiguang, and Wu Binghao also worked hard. The Jinling generals ran quickly, but their shooting skills were poor. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>

<h3>Letter from Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College sent a letter stating: "Dear Sir, yesterday your newspaper reported that there was a beating incident involving our school's students in the Tiecheng Cup basketball game on the 6th, which was probably based on a submission.

In addition to reporting the situation at the time to the Municipal Government and related agencies to thoroughly investigate the incident, after a thorough investigation and clarification of the truth and responsibility, we will publicly announce the entire situation.

<h3>Western League A Group Football Match: Jinan Today Fights Western Police</h3>
<p>Zilin Elementary Two Cup Competitions Held for the Semi-Finals - Yesterday's Rain and Snow May Make Today's Match Difficult</p>
<p>There are six Western League football matches today. Two A-group matches, the Zilin and Elementary Two Cup semi-finals, and one each for the B and C groups. The Zhen Dan team has qualified for the semi-finals in both cups and must face both You You (Zilin Cup) and Jinde (Elementary Cup) strong teams at the same time, which is really not easy. In the A-group match, the Western Police's Yacha Xu will personally play. Jinan's hopes of winning against them are also very weak, but they should be able to resist stubbornly, and the score should not be too disparate. Yesterday there was heavy snow, and today it may be difficult to hold the match. Whether the match will be held can be inquired from each venue or by calling 16512 at 11:00 AM today. The schedule and lineup are as follows:</p>

<h3>City Museum to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Report Was Made to the Press on the Preparation Process</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3 PM, the City Museum hosted members of the press, with over fifty reporters from various newspapers attending. The museum's director, Hu Zhaochun, the head of the general affairs department, Chen Duanzhi, and the head of the history department, Xu Weinan, were present to receive the guests. The event began with light refreshments in the reading room, followed by a report from Director Hu on the museum's preparatory process. Afterwards, the reporters were guided through the various rooms for a tour. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>During the session, Director Hu provided a brief overview of the museum's preparation process and its significance, stating that museums, as modern cultural institutions dedicated to preserving human history, promoting education, and enhancing national awareness and research spirit, share a similar function with libraries in terms of cultural impact. Therefore, modern civilized cities invariably establish both libraries and museums. Shanghai's library system was established relatively early, while museums were notably absent. Recognizing this, the municipal authorities designated 300,000 yuan from the 3.5 million yuan in construction bonds issued in the 23rd year of the city's construction for museum construction expenses, with equipment costs separate. A provisional board of directors was established in March of the 24th year, and a preparatory office was established on November 15th of the 24th year to collect exhibits. The focus is entirely on Shanghai's history, including old Shanghai industries, the city's transportation and port facilities, models of important buildings, and various documents, all of which can demonstrate the traces of local development. Other items such as clothing, ornaments, coins, and entertainment tools can also provide insights into the changing customs of a particular time and place. Museums are not merely antique collections but should strive to fulfill their function and manifest their significance. The preparation time was very short, and the funding was limited, which made it difficult to achieve full satisfaction. However, thanks to the concern and attention of Mayor Wu and Chairman Ye Yuhu, and the guidance and support from various parties, such as Mr. Di Pingzi, Mr. Ding Fubao, and Mr. He Sui, valuable items were either deposited or donated. With the exception of paintings and calligraphy, which are temporarily limited to the Ming and Qing dynasties, the exhibits are arranged chronologically, presenting a rough system of the evolution of Chinese art and culture. The municipal government has approved a temporary annual operating budget of 50,000 yuan, which will be supplemented gradually to achieve perfection. After the speech, he led the reporters on a tour of the various rooms.</p>
<p>Layout Description</p>
<p>The museum covers a total area of 19,000 square feet, with the building occupying ten-tenths of the space. The exhibition area is divided into seven sections and five corridors. The front left and right sides of the ground floor are the library reading room and lecture hall, respectively. The rooms on both sides of the corridor are offices. The central corridor is the first exhibition room, with the first and second exhibition corridors on the left and right. Behind it is the second exhibition room, with storage and technical rooms on the left and right. The rear part of the second floor is the third exhibition room, connected to the front by the third and fourth exhibition corridors, which run parallel to the fourth, fifth, and sixth exhibition rooms. The third floor has the fifth exhibition corridor and the seventh exhibition room. The basement is the tin furnace room, equipped with air conditioning equipment. The display cabinets were manufactured by the Dahua Iron Factory, with thoughtful designs that integrate scientific, artistic, and ingenious elements.</p>
<p>Exhibited Items</p>
<p>The exhibits in the first room are mostly displayed openly, such as the four stone-carved maxims written by Lu Wenyu of the Ming dynasty and gifted to his nephew, the renowned Gu embroidery from the Luxiang Garden in Shanghai, a gilded Buddha statue from the Ming dynasty, various stone carvings, religious statues, roof ornaments, and the museum's self-made world standard time clock and world time map. The second room features models of salt fields, the textile process, and fishing boats, which represent Shanghai's three major industries. Other exhibits include navigation routes, floating bridges, tide markers, various transportation models, bank statistics, bill samples, stationery, measuring instruments, the origin of printing presses, and models of the Longhua Pagoda. Among them, the earliest traffic map of the Songhu Road is particularly noteworthy. The third room displays daily necessities, classified and exhibited to represent the changes of the times. In particular, a cabinet of hairstyles from different dynasties is most striking. According to Director Hu, the museum spent countless efforts and materials, worth over a thousand yuan, to replicate this cabinet of hairstyles. The fourth room contains stone tools, jade artifacts, bronzes, pottery, seals, and currencies. Among them, there are 1,005 seals, meticulously selected, and 892 ancient coins, which are old Jinqian collections, acquired over 36 years and representing a monetary system, purchased by Ding Fubao and donated to the museum. The fifth room contains fossils and oracle bones for archaeological study. It also displays a very large puppet stage, exquisitely carved. The sixth room contains burial objects from the Ming dynasty and porcelain, lacquerware, bamboo and wood artifacts, paintings, and calligraphy. The seventh room displays models of new urban construction. The first corridor contains stone carvings, models of seals, inscriptions, rubbings, photos, gazetteers, and statistics, as well as the Sun and Moon coins of the Small Swords Society. The second corridor contains military weapons from different dynasties, a royal axe from the Chenghua period of the Ming dynasty, small bronze cannons from the Zhengtong period, tribute documents from Korea, letters from the Qing dynasty to Cuba, imperial decrees from the Kangxi period, and examination papers, all of which are rarely seen. The third corridor displays old-fashioned jewelry and medals. The fourth corridor displays stamps, banknotes, and portraits of local worthies. The fifth temple displays ancient inscriptions and rubbings.</p>
<p>Visiting Information</p>
<p>The museum is open daily from January 5th to December 25th each year, except on Tuesdays and during special events, which will be announced by notice. The hours are from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM from January 5th to January 30th, from 9:30 AM to 4:30 PM from February 1st to February 21st, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM from April 1st to September 30th, from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM from October 1st to November 15th, and from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM from November 16th to December 25th. However, admission is allowed no later than half an hour before closing time. The admission fee is 10 cents per person (free for those under 90 cm in height), and half price for groups (limited to 20 or more people). However, elementary school students are admitted free of charge when accompanied by their teachers. Director Hu told reporters that the museum originally did not want to charge admission fees for the sake of popularizing education. However, in light of the opening of the new municipal government building to the public, which resulted in the destruction of facilities by nearby ignorant villagers and costly repairs, fees are temporarily charged as a restriction. To facilitate visits, a joint ticket arrangement has been made with the China General Omnibus Company. Those who purchase tickets directly from the North Railway Station to the museum will pay only about 1.5 cents more than the regular bus fare.</p>

<p>After the Japanese Government Strengthens Exchange Control, Over Two Million in East Exchange Transactions, Chinese Merchants Selling and Japanese Merchants Buying</p>
<p>In the foreign exchange market yesterday, the morning opened with overseas telegrams indicating that both near and distant London Treasury bills rose by 1.25, the New York silver market was stable, up by half a cent, the forward silver price in Montreal rose by 4 li, London gold rose by 1.5 pence, Sterling against the US dollar was stable, Sterling against the French franc fell by 3 pence, the US dollar against Sterling was stable, the US dollar against the French franc contracted by 1.25. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both Sterling and the US dollar stable, and the customs gold unit rose by 2 li. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices, Sterling at 1 shilling 2 pence 53125, the US dollar at 29.75 yuan. Compared with the previous close, both Sterling and the US dollar remained stable. After the opening, only the banks were doing a little trading. HSBC's posted rates were both stable, and the silver equalization tax rose by half a cent. The Bank of Japan maintained the East exchange at a low price, and although the customer side was selling, it still had no impact. However, due to the further strengthening of exchange management by Japan, an order was issued yesterday stating that the purchase and sale of Japanese yen, with very few exceptions, must be approved by the government. The future is predictable. At noon yesterday, large Chinese merchants also sold East exchange, which caused the Sterling and US dollar to weaken due to a lack of support. Although Mobil and the Bank of Japan were buying later, they were still forced by the selling pressure, and the trend continued to be weak. At the close, recent selling prices, Sterling at 1 shilling 1 pence 53125 and 5625 paired, the US dollar at 29.78125, which were slightly looser compared to the previous close. Large Chinese merchants and non-industry players sold over one million yuan of East exchange, as did the Da Yun gang. The transaction record is as follows:</p>
<p>Sterling opened in the morning with a recent selling price of 1 shilling 2 pence 53125. Dalian gang sold spot at 5625 to HSBC. The Bank of England sold February at half a penny.

<p>The Standard Gold Bar Remains Unchanged, Spot Buying Price Slightly More Expensive</p>
<p>The gold market initially opened with both the English and American silver markets rising, and the forward silver price in Montreal also rising by 4 li. The exchange rate was still stable, and London spot gold rebounded by 1.5 pence. The Central Bank's posted rates were announced, with both Sterling and the US dollar remaining stable, and the customs gold unit rising by 2 li. The standard gold bar price was also raised to 1151 yuan and 3 jiao. The public's sentiment was still not active, and some people were buying when prices were low. HSBC's posted rates were also stable and slightly raised, and although the silver equalization tax rose by half a cent, the spot price was slightly sold, and soon stabilized again. Later, due to the strengthening of the domestic market, the multi-party was pessimistic, and it once dropped slightly, but the result was still unchanged compared with the previous close, but the spot selling price was slightly more expensive. The spot swap was quoted by the deliverers at 1 yuan and 6 jiao. Today's market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1155 yuan, the same price as the previous close. Qingfa Yong limited purchases. HSBC's posted rates were announced, and Sterling and the US dollar remained stable and extremely stable. Hong Changyong also purchased, rising to 5 yuan and 2 jiao. Dafeng Hengsheng Yuan Yong sold out. Today's close was 1155 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon opening was still 1155 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong sold bars. The exchange rate strengthened, and retreated to 4 yuan and 7 jiao. Qingfa Yong and Dadecheng purchased bars. The closing was still 1155 yuan. The result was unchanged again.</p>
<p>The closing price was raised by the Central Bank's posted standard gold bar price to 1151 yuan and 3 jiao. According to the closing price, it was raised by less than 4 yuan. The price of pure gold was still plus 8 yuan, at 1163 yuan. The spot market was slightly stable, and the buying price was slightly higher, because the delivery period was closer. Refined gold was plus 12 yuan, Tianjin goods were plus 13.5 yuan and lacked supply, and the selling price was plus 15 yuan, with no transactions. Recently, there has been no source of Tianjin goods, and only a small amount has arrived from Xiamen, so the trend is sluggish.</p>
<p>Trading in the trading floor was limited. In summary, Qingfa Yongheng and others were on the buying side, while Dadecheng Yuan Mao Yong Dafeng Hengsheng Yuanyong Qiafeng Yong and others were on the selling side. Except for the public orders, there were 2002 bars left for this month's bars, and 5838 bars were planned for the February period. In total, there were 28 long positions and 19 short positions. The total number of transactions was 91 bars in the morning session and 140 bars in the afternoon session.</p>
<p>The public order released 28 bars to the short position yesterday. The long positions should receive them today, Futaiding 14 bars, Qingfa Yongchun Yuanyong 7 bars each. The closing price was 1153 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Affected by the Osaka Sampin Market, Yarn and Cotton Prices Fluctuated Sharply. Morning prices surged due to reports of a surge in Sampin yarn prices, breaking the 50 yuan line in various months. In the afternoon, rumors of a reversal emerged, causing selling pressure to intensify and prices to plummet.</p>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell, with an unusually complex trend, entirely influenced by the Osaka Sampin yarn market. In the early morning, Sampin yarn for the current month surged by nearly 11 yuan, shocking the market. Floating shorts turned long, and the market was tight. Prices for various months together broke through the 50 yuan mark. In the afternoon, Sampin yarn for the current month opened again at a high of 290.01 yuan. Unexpectedly, the close reversed, plunging 12 yuan, with the February contract plummeting 13.8 yuan. As soon as the news spread, selling pressure intensified, and the three markets plunged wildly by 1.8 or 9 yuan, again falling below the 50 yuan mark. The closing telecommunications of Sampin yarn confirmed the fall of the market.</p>
<p>The Listed Yarn Prices Fluctuated Violently</p>
<p>The listed yarn market opened in the morning, with prices rising uniformly across all months, with extreme enthusiasm. This was because Osaka Sampin yarn prices were soaring, jumping over 11 yuan for the current month, once reaching 289 yuan, causing excitement and short covering. Prices for various months rose above the 50 yuan mark, but there were no changes after the second session. The industry was gloomy because of weak sales in the spot yarn market and even narrower sales of coarse yarn. By the close, it was heard that Sampin yarn for the near month had fallen back by 2.4 yuan, and the far month had risen by 3.4 yuan, and the market rebounded again. As a result, various months rose by 1.3 to 4.2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market opened in the afternoon, with Sampin yarn for the current month breaking 290 yuan, reaching 290.01 yuan, with the atmosphere even more tense. Prices for various months rose by another yuan. A part of the second session had already received wireless news that Sampin yarn had fallen back by 12 yuan, and that the forward contract had already fallen by 1.3 yuan. At the same time, spot yarn trading was still sluggish. By the third close, the decline intensified, and the result was a sharp drop of 2.4, 5, 6 jiao to 3 yuan for various months compared to the morning close. It was found that 4,000 bales of Gengfeng were sold, 1,100 bales of Tongfu, 1,850 bales of Yuda, 1,400 bales of Jinchang, 1,800 bales of Mingde, 2,650 bales of Renfeng, 1,250 bales of Wangtai and Yi, 2,000 bales of Yicheng, 1,350 bales of Xiesheng, 1,300 bales of Hengchang, 1,450 bales of Daqing, and 1,950 bales of Wu Yi. The buyers were Juxing 1,650 bales, Dafeng 950 bales, Yiji 1,100 bales, Fengtai 1,250 bales, Dachangcheng 2,600 bales, Runkang 3,450 bales, Dachang 1,800 bales, Taichang 3,050 bales, Fukang 5,400 bales, and Shengyuan 1,750 bales. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices All Rose</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were still good, with a total of 981 bales bought by various gangs throughout the day. The selling prices rose by one yuan and the thread rose by three yuan. The prices of the various gangs are listed below.</p>
<p>The cotton market was originally flat, but because the Sampin cotton market rose wildly step by step, it jumped three or four yuan. The American and Indian cotton markets also rebounded, and people were drawn into a good situation. In the afternoon, because the yarn market fell back, and it was rumored that the East was strengthening foreign exchange control, the market situation took a sharp turn, and the current month again fell below the three yuan mark.</p>
<p>Cotton Declined in the Near Month and Rose in the Far Month</p>
<p>The listed cotton market opened in the morning, and because the American and Indian cotton markets had risen, the people's hearts were lifted, and the yarn market turned high-flying, with the Osaka Sampin cotton futures jumping wildly over three yuan. The buying trend was even stronger. After the first session, it showed a slight setback, and as a result, various months rose by 3, 4, 5, and 6 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon market opened, and because the Sampin cotton market opened again in the futures market, the buying increased slightly. However, some of the long positions took the opportunity to release a large amount of cotton. The second session opened with a weak yarn market, and the decline resumed, re-entering a tired path. As a result, various months fell by 4.5 to 5 jiao compared to the morning close. It was found that Dachangcheng sold 1,800 dan, Jinchang 4,300 dan, Senkang 2,700 dan, Fengtai 2,400 dan, Renfeng 3,400 dan, Taichang 3,500 dan, Shengyuan 3,700 dan, Fukang 3,400 dan, Tonghe 1,800 dan, and Xiesheng 1,100 dan. The buyers were Jifeng 1,600 dan, Tongji 3,900 dan, Gengfeng 4,800 dan, Shenji 1,900 dan, Yuan Yi 2,000 dan, Changhe 8,800 dan, Yichang 1,400 dan, Hengchang 2,700 dan, Shenchang 1,300 dan, and Changji 1,200 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot cotton consumption was mediocre. Cotton was weak and uneasy, and the source was 1,800 bales of Yao cotton and 1,268 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Sampin Yarn Rose and Fell Wildly, Cotton Once Jumped Three or Four Yuan in the Morning</p>
<p>(Osaka, 8th) The prices of Sampin yarn fluctuated violently. In the morning, they rose wildly by more than ten yuan, and the afternoon rebound was also huge. As a result, various months still rose by 3 jiao to 1.4 yuan. The near-month closing price was 278.1 yuan, and the far-month was 259.3 yuan. In addition, cotton prices all rose by 1.75 yuan to 2.45 yuan. The near-month closing price was 73.4 yuan, and the far-month was 76.05 yuan.</p>
<p>American, British, and Indian Cotton All Rose</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened, and the news from Liverpool was good. The cloth market was active, and industry players bought the near month. German transactions improved, and various months rose by three to seven pounds. Subsequently, long positions closed out, and Yaleo was shorted, with a slight reversal. However, at the low price of cotton pledged for loans, it immediately encountered resistance. Because five delivery notices for the January contract were issued, some long positions closed out. When the market closed, the stock market was strong, and there were hopes for resolving the labor unrest. The market price strengthened again. It is estimated that the spot price rose by 11 pounds, and the futures price fell by 1 pound to rise by 16 pounds. The British cotton spot price rose by 9 points, and the futures price rose by 56 points. Indian cotton was initially weak due to short selling, and then rose due to the upward trend of Japanese yarn and large purchases by exporters. There were not many short sales and long positions taking profits. It is estimated that Pingle rose by 4 to 4.5 rupees, Omar rose by 3.75 to 4.25 rupees, and Bai Luoxi rose by 3.75 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (7th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the 8th was Bai Luoxi at 230.5 rupees, Omar at 208 rupees, and Pingle at 178.25 rupees, all up by 0.75 rupees.</p>
<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Buying Momentum Returns, Flour and Wheat Prices Rebound Strongly</p>
<p>After the flour market opened, the prices for various months showed a sharp rebound.  Foreign wheat quotations saw Chicago rise by six to four jiao (tenths of a yuan), Canada rise by about six to seven jiao, and Liverpool rise by two pence zero.  After the opening prices were announced, the market had been falling for two or three consecutive days without any sign of reversing.  Speculators outside the industry suddenly became active, and because only four months of futures were being traded, the market was not smooth.  Therefore, as soon as buying increased, prices were easily pushed up.  Opening prices for both near-term and long-term futures rose by five to six fen (hundredths of a yuan) compared to the previous day.  A slight pullback was observed during the second trading session, but the bullish momentum persisted, boosting market sentiment.  When the market opened in the afternoon, trading volume for various months was sluggish, and prices tended to fluctuate.  The focus of competition currently shifts entirely with foreign quotations.  However, those at the center of the industry believed that market values were already high, and there were not many inquiries.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, prices for various months showed a uniform upward trend.  Foreign wheat quotations rebounded by four to six or seven jiao.  Given the continuous decline for several days since the market opened, a rebound was inevitable.  Therefore, opening prices for various months were raised accordingly.  Near-term futures rose by eight to nine fen, while long-term futures rose by more than one jiao.  Although there was a surplus of domestic wheat, it was scattered among merchants and difficult to concentrate.  Therefore, people's sentiment was easily stirred at the first opportunity.  When the market opened in the afternoon, there was very little trading in the current month, while outsiders resumed buying long-term futures, tightening market sentiment.  The price of new wheat for June did not rise much because of the recent snowfall, which calmed people's minds.  Fuxin Flour Mill imported 2,000 bags of wheat at a slightly higher price of two to three fen.  Wheat from Kaiyao Bay, Yanghe, and Huaian ranged from six yuan five jiao seven or eight fen to six yuan four jiao five fen.</p>
<p>Rice Shipments from the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River in Rain and Snow Are Scarce</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, there were over eighty firms from various provinces, with 16,400-16,500 shi (a unit of dry measure) of goods, including over forty firms dealing in inferior rice.  The local market was watching and waiting, as demand remained weak.  Only the Qingdao firms handled over 1,000 bags of inferior rice.  Most of the goods in the market failed to trade, and the situation weakened further.  However, sellers, seeing the rain and snow, and considering their relationship with the mainland, held firm, forming a stable situation.  Prices for thick and thin粳(jīng) rice remained unchanged, while various grades of Duyangjian (杜洋尖) and Yinyuan (陰元) rice remained stable.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, shipments from various routes along the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were quite abundant, with approximately fifty to sixty firms and three hundred sixty to three hundred seventy boats moored along the river.  Due to the continuous rain and snow, few shops were open in the market, and trading in various goods was limited.  However, warehouse owners of white粳(jīng) rice seized the opportunity to profit, and the price of white粳(jīng) rice rose by a few fen to one jiao.  The price of inferior rice rose by a few fen, and the price of early rice followed closely, rising by nearly one jiao.  The price of Baiyuan (白元) rice rose by slightly more than one jiao, while the price of Yangdubukejian (羊杜埠客尖) rice rose by five to six fen.  The prices of other goods remained weak.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice Trading in the Local Market Is Quite Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for客秈(kè xiān) rice was quite lively, with prices for all types of milled rice rising, especially Yuanmi (元米), which was actively traded in the local market, leading to a tighter market.  Prices were two to two and a half jiao higher than the previous day.  Prices for other milled rice also rose by one to one and a half jiao each.  When the market opened in the morning, local merchants had ample inventory, and rice prices were stable, with only three to five thousand bags traded.  Subsequently, merchants from the Guangdong Oil and Liang gangs continued to inquire, and Zhengzhou also actively traded in milled late-season rice.  The local market became even more eager and focused on milled Yuanmi (元米), causing a sudden sharp rise in the market.  If shipments continue to be strong today and tomorrow, the market may need to rise further.  A total of 500 bags of Yongyuan (甬元) rice, 1,000 bags of Han milled rice, 8,200+ bags of Gan rice, and 4,643 bags of Xiang rice were traded throughout the day.

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Fluctuate with a Slightly Soft Trend, Reconstruction Bonds Not Traded All Day</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market was extremely weak due to the unchanged political situation.  Market conditions became increasingly sluggish, as both bulls and bears remained firm, adopting a wait-and-see approach.  Market prices fluctuated minimally, showing a fluctuating trend.  Many bulls closed out positions for profit, leading to a slight weakening.  However, the trend is still brewing and waiting.  Reconstruction bonds were not traded at all because of the shortage of chips and high prices.  When the market opened in the morning, numbers like 77•35 were actively selling, and market prices fell by one to one and a half jiao.  However, many retail investors were still buying, and the trend in the second session shifted from weak to firm.  Numbers like Wuding (戊丁) 10•77 were still selling heavily, falling by a small five fen to three jiao.  Numbers 35•45 turned to buying.  Grade B bonds rose by one to two jiao starting next month.  When the market opened in the afternoon, market conditions became dull and chaotic again.  Number 5 had strong buying interest, and numbers Ding (丁) and Bing (丙) were up by about one jiao.  Wujia (戊甲) this month and Grade B next month were down by a small five fen.  Trading volume at the close was sparse, with very few transactions by large investors, and retail investors also bought and sold unevenly.  Market prices generally fluctuated between five fen and one jiao.  Overall, the result for the day was a slight decline of five fen to one jiao.  The total transaction volume was 3,235,000 yuan.  A table comparing the rise, fall, high, and low prices is shown below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Domestic Green Sugar Prices Continue to Rise Sharply, Truly Rare During the New Crop Season</p>
<p>Yesterday, domestic sugar remained tight and continued to rise.  Such abnormal development at the time of the new crop is rare in recent years, and there are fears that the future will change.  Yesterday, No. Pan had Jianbang open 500+ bags of Diao Qing at 13 yuan and 7 jiao, a rise of 5 jiao. Guangdong and Shantou gangs opened 300+ bags of Nanjiang Qingyuan Sliced Qing at 11 yuan and 8 jiao, a rise of 8 jiao. Beihai Sliced Qing 600+ boxes at 11 yuan, a rise of 7-8 jiao. Also threw out 200 pieces of Shimen Sliced Qing to be shipped in one week, priced at 11 yuan and 1 jiao and a half. Zhu Qing 300+ bags at 13 yuan and 3 jiao, a rise of 5 jiao. Ti Zhuang Qing 14 yuan and 4 jiao, Huanggang Qing 14 yuan, Lai Nan Qing 13 yuan and 6-7 jiao, with a total transaction of 300+ bags. For forward Japanese sugar, Meiji, Da Li, and Kobe opened 30,000+ bags for March and April, priced at YP Lou as the standard, 7 yuan and 4 jiao with a discount.</p>
<p>The Association set the price of spot Second-Fourth grade coarse white sugar at 22 yuan and 1 jiao, re-export at 6 yuan and 8 jiao, East White No. 4 TE mark re-export goods at 7 yuan and 7 and a half fen, YRO mark spot goods at 21 yuan and 5 and a half jiao, all with transactions. Mianbai (绵白) Zhenji No. 1 from this factory, 20 yuan and 8 jiao, Jinxin Dahua No. 1, 20 yuan and 9 jiao, with the rest discounted. The combined company yesterday was the third bidding period of the week, with a total of 2,500 bags of Shunde Wuyang Coarse White at 22 yuan, a rise of 1 jiao, all cleared. It is rumored that it will need to be increased by another 2 jiao starting next week.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods</h3>
<p>Black Melon Seeds Rise Again</p>
<p>Due to Lack of Inventory in Production Areas</p>
<p>Recently, black melon seeds have been rising repeatedly in the market due to the scarcity of inventory in various production areas.  The scarce inventory has led to price increases, tightening the market.  Yesterday, the market price of Mingguang seeds opened at 20 yuan, another increase of one yuan compared to before.  Other higher-quality goods also rose by one or two yuan.  Even various熟貨(shú huò) melon seed companies on the local street were buying.  There was also buying interest from the mainland, while export gangs were less active.  The market price for Jikui seeds was 25 yuan, Tizhuang seeds 24 yuan, Xukui seeds 22 yuan and a half, Mingguang seeds 19 yuan and a half, and Linhuaiguan了(le) seeds 19 yuan.  The market may tighten further in the future.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Yinzhuang Silk Sales Recover</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets saw slight gains in both Japan and the United States, but not as high as previous market records. Yokohama spot goods rose by 10 yuan, and long-term futures rose by 17 yuan. New York near-term goods rose by one and a half to two fen. Lyon silk prices remained unchanged. Sales of Shanghai Baichang county silk for export were sluggish. Only Dachang and other firms bought 50 dan (a unit of weight) of high-grade Baichang silk yesterday. In addition, sales of Yinzhuang silk have recovered. It is expected that after the expiration of the Japan-India trade agreement, Chinese silk sales to India will recover. Yesterday, Samsung, Kechang, and other firms purchased 100+ dan of Jili and Shuanggong silk. Prices for goods were brisk. User silk and Hangzhou silk purchases were also strong. Prices for Baichang Tiantai grade heavy reeling silk, sold at 805研(yán), remained stable. Yesterday, a total of 262 bales were traded in the city.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Local Nail Manufacturers Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell Stockpiles, Blue Lead Iron in Short Supply and Prices Soar</p>
<p>Local metal nail manufacturers are taking advantage of high prices to sell stockpiles because foreign nail factories lack raw materials (i.e., cracked nail metal wire).  Consequently, the price of 倍司(bèi sī) has been rising steadily, with the highest price reaching 11 yuan per barrel.  However, factories did not ship much, causing buyers to lament.  In recent days, warehouse owners who had previously purchased goods have been eager to sell at the current high prices.  Therefore, the market has seen large quantities of spot goods being sold off in recent days.  Yesterday, 2,000 barrels were opened, with the price at 10 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per barrel.  However, trading at hardware stores and inter-dealer transactions still required 11 yuan to 11 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Blue lead iron has recently been selling in spot markets.  New goods have not arrived, and prices have been rising steadily, selling at 21 yuan per box (original box).  Scrap iron in 14-inch and 20-inch lengths costs 33 yuan and 5 jiao, while 20-inch and 28-inch lengths cost 34 yuan.  Yesterday, four or five斗箱(dǒu xiāng) were opened in the market and purchased by printing and canning factories.  Since there were no spot goods for merchant-to-merchant sales, no new goods were opened.  New goods are expected to arrive for loading early next month.</p>

<p>Women's Supplement</p>
<h3>The Three Major Premises That Women Should Strive for This Year</h3>
<p>— Weijing</p>
<p>The year 1936 is over. What contributions have women made to society and the country in the past year? I will not discuss it in detail here. Anyway, speaking of it, extravagance and laziness have occupied most of the page. However, let the past be the past. In this coming year, I hope women will make some progress in their work, so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past year.</p>
<p>To avoid repeating the mistakes of the past year, I believe the following three points cannot be ignored:</p>
<p>(1) Promotion of Labor: In the past year, civic training, labor service, and so on have sprung up everywhere. The decadent atmosphere in the country has been revitalized. Originally, "Strengthening the country starts with strengthening the body" is something every elementary school student knows. Moreover, in this extraordinary period, a strong body is even more indispensable. However, it is a great pity that in the past year's civic training, labor service, and so on, men have taken the lead. In ordinary families, men go to the playground early in the morning, while women are still dreaming in bed. Men carry hoes and shovels to build roads and dredge rivers, while women just hide at home, playing cards and having fun. And the more educated women are, the more they indulge in such comfortable pleasures. This kind of attitude is absolutely unacceptable. Women are also masters of the Republic of China and are equally responsible as men for reviving the nation. To shoulder this important task, it is essential to have the spirit and body to endure hard work and hardship. Therefore, I hope that educated women will, from today onwards, lead the promotion of labor and join labor groups.</p>
<p>(2) Maintaining Personal Integrity: It is indeed beyond reproach for women to engage in occupations. However, in reality, the big hat of women's occupations conceals many unspeakable darknesses. In our society, there are quite a few profit-seeking merchants who use women to attract customers. These professional women, who are only used to attract customers, are in reality selling themselves in the name of occupations, which has almost become an undeniable fact in this era. The guide agencies that were popular for a while last year but have now been banned are one example. However, occupations are not divided into noble and lowly. The original purpose of women's occupations was simply to promote an independent life of self-reliance. Therefore, it is not absolutely impossible for women to be guides. However, the first element is that "self-reliance" must not be forgotten. Those who can be self-reliant, even if they are female workers, are very sacred. Those who do not work and gain, even if they are sitting in big chairs in the office, are just vases. Therefore, I hope that women in the professional circle will, from today onwards, not accept a penny more than the reward they deserve for their knowledge or labor, so as to preserve their integrity.</p>
<p>(3) Social Service: This is a requirement for ordinary women who are well-fed all day long and do nothing. The social service mentioned here does not refer to seeking employment. My intention is simply to ask housewives to strive for some social undertakings. For example, in the literacy education for the common people that was held last year, many housewives oppressed their servants, not allowing them to attend classes, otherwise threatening them with dismissal. Just this one incident fully demonstrates our attitude towards social welfare undertakings. To give another example, such as the recent aid-to-Suiyuan movement. There were indeed those who worked hard to sew or donate silk-cotton vests, but there were also those who were stingy in giving their children a small donation for aid to Suiyuan. These are indeed extremely worrying phenomena for the future of the country and the nation. Therefore, I hope that ordinary housewives will, from today onwards, not place themselves outside of society. Rather, they must regard society as their own family.</p>
<h3>Several Women Worth Praising</h3>
<p>— Zongxu</p>
<p>Madam Han Shizhong: Han Shizhong, whose courtesy name was Shizhong, was a national hero who lived at the same time as Yue Wumu (Yue Fei). His wife was the famous Liang Hongyu. The story in the Yue Biography about her bombing the Two Wolf Passes with cannons is a vivid description by novelists, and the world's worship of her is said to have largely originated from this. But she was not only brave but also wise. Helin Yulu once recorded an anecdote about her, saying that after she married General Han, he performed outstanding feats and became a famous general, so she was named the Lady of Two Kingdoms. One day, General Han invited Wuzhu to Huangtiandang and almost captured him, but due to a moment of carelessness, Wuzhu dug a river and escaped. Madam Han was furious when she heard the news and immediately submitted a memorial, saying: "Shizhong lost the opportunity to let the enemy go, please add punishment." Everyone in the court was moved by this. Her wisdom and heroism were such that, can such a figure be found in today's women's circles?</p>
<p>Madam Zhou Yuji: Zhou Yuji was the General Commander of Bingwu Pass in the late Ming Dynasty. He died with the city when the rebel Li Zicheng attacked. He was posthumously named Zhongwu. There is a Kunqu opera called "Bie Mu Luan Jian" (Farewell Mother Amidst a Rain of Arrows), which tells his tragic story. His wife, Madam Liu, followed her husband in the marshal's tent, loved to read books on military strategy, and repeatedly helped her husband achieve extraordinary feats. After Zhou Yuji died in battle, she supervised women in street fighting. The number of rebels she killed was nearly ten thousand until the arrows ran out, and then she committed suicide to show her loyalty. The History of the Ming Dynasty included her in the biography of Zhou Yuji. Wei Minguo Gong Xiangshu of Shanxi had a poem praising her, titled: "When the rebel Li Zicheng captured Baowu Pass in the year Jia Shen, General Commander Zhou died in battle." The poem says: "Shouting loudly, the High Emperor came out of the city, the only one in three hundred years. Many warriors offered him wine, and a lone minister hoisted the banner before the army. He was not ashamed to be a true man when wrapped in a shroud, and it was heard that a woman wore armor. If the general were still alive, how dare the comet approach the imperial court." The so-called "it was heard that a woman wore armor" refers to his wife.</p>
<p>Madam Yang Chengzhai: Yang Chengzhai was a great Confucian of the Song Dynasty. His son, Dongshan, served as the Prefect of our Huzhou, so Mr. Chengzhai visited Xinshi. The Deqing County Annals have his poems to check. His wife, Luo, was over seventy years old. Every cold month at dawn, she would get up early and go to the kitchen to personally make a pot of porridge, which she would share with the servants before ordering them to do their respective duties. Her son, Mr. Dongshan, said to her: "Mother, why do you make yourself suffer so much?" Madam said: "Servants are also human beings. In the cold morning, their stomachs must have some warmth before they can serve." Mr. Dongshan said: "Mother is old, and this is a lowly task. Why do you do things backwards?" Madam said angrily: "I enjoy this. You do not know the cold. If you say this, you will certainly not be able to do as I do." Mr. Dongshan did not dare to say anything more. Moreover, Madam usually wore only silver jewelry and clothing made of silk and coarse silk. She gave birth to four sons and three daughters, and all of them were breastfed by her. She once said to others: "To have the children of hungry people breastfeed my children, what kind of heart is that?" (See Helin Yulu) Such a woman is truly rare in ancient and modern times. It would not be an exaggeration to use her as a model of a virtuous wife and good mother.</p>
<p>Madam Wang Weimei: Wang Weimei, whose courtesy name was 渢(fēng), was a native of Qiantang, Zhejiang. He was aloof and seldom harmonious with others, so everyone called him Wang Leng. In the late Ming Dynasty, he passed the provincial examination. Prefect Qian admired his talent and promised his daughter to Weimei. When they got married, the bride entered the house with grand decorations. Weimei was very disapproving of this and warned her not to do this in the future. So she discarded her ornaments and dismissed her maids, doing the work herself in coarse cloth. The young couple respected each other like guests. After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, Weimei, bearing the pain of the fallen country, abandoned the imperial examinations. Some of his relatives by marriage hoped that he would become an official and wanted to force him to take the Ministry of Rites examination. Fearing that Weimei would not agree, they showed her a thousand taels of silver, saying: "If you can persuade your husband to take the exam, I will give this to you." She replied: "My husband cannot be persuaded, and I do not love this money either." She ultimately fulfilled her husband's integrity. It is truly admirable that a mere woman can understand the righteousness so deeply. (See Erlin Ju Ji) Those who accept bribes and lead their husbands into injustice should feel ashamed in front of this madam.</p>
<p>There are many women worth praising throughout ancient and modern times, but due to the limited space in this publication, I have only listed the above four. Among these four, there are those with wisdom, benevolence, and courage, which can serve as a reference for general women in the current extraordinary period. Because in extraordinary times, there is a particularly urgent need for such typical women.</p>
<h3>Women's Life in the Suburbs of Beijing</h3>
<p>— Zhengyan</p>
<p>The rural families in the suburbs of Beiping (Beijing) are mostly extremely poor. Nine out of ten villagers in the four suburban areas make a living by farming. However, due to years of drought, the harvest of soybeans, wheat, and other crops is not good, and their livelihoods are even more difficult. Others who work as stone masons or carters are even more miserable. Therefore, the women in the suburbs of Beijing are naturally struggling in a dark life in this kind of family environment.</p>
<p>However, "the more impoverished and difficult, the more vigorous the spirit of diligence and endurance"; the women in the four suburbs of Beiping are worthy of this kind of praise. They only know how to resist the harsh surroundings and do not grieve or curse their fate. That is, in addition to taking care of household chores all day long and helping the men with farming in the fields, they also have several fixed side jobs, which are weaving mats, weaving cattails, embroidery, needlepoint, and sewing, etc. Whenever they have a little free time, it is their working time, even at night until midnight; to increase the family income.</p>
<p>Among several side jobs, embroidery and needlepoint are better. They mostly work for the general embroidery shops in Ping City, and they are paid according to the amount of production (there are very few female workers). Usually, one person can earn three, four jiao to six, seven jiao per day, while those who weave mats can only earn two or three jiao per day. Those who sew and wash clothes also earn about two or three jiao. The forms of weaving cattails are different, including cattail hats, cattail shoes, cattail hoops, cattail cushions, etc. Often, it takes half a day to a day to weave each item, but the price at which it is sold only gets one or two jiao. Some can only be exchanged for a dozen copper coins, which is even more difficult. However, due to the decline of the embroidery industry in Beiping in recent years and the increased number of women learning embroidery, embroidery is also much worse than before and is very meager!</p>
<p>Most pitiful are the extremely poor families. Girls from seven, eight years old to over ten years old, wearing ragged and unclean clothes, crouching and walking in the suburbs all day long; picking up the firewood left on the ground. Especially in the autumn and winter seasons, when the northwest wind blows from the Mongolian plateau, sand and stones fly, obscuring the face, and the climate changes from cold to frostbite; their firewood picking work is even more diligent, enduring hunger and cold. Originally, this firewood, in addition to the occasional pieces dropped by those who went out to chop firewood, was mostly blown down by hurricanes that broke tree branches and was mostly blown in from other highland areas, so the more it gets to winter, the more the wind blows and the trees wither, the more firewood is left. The price they get for selling this firewood is about 20-30 yuan per year for older girls and only about 10 yuan for younger ones. The misery can be known!</p>
<p>After reading this article, we can also imagine what the life of poor women in urban Beiping is like? However, the virtuous and good women who are brave to endure hardship for the family are happy and do not complain. It is a pity that in recent years, the intensified foreign aggression has made their lives especially painful!</p>
<h3>Seeing Women's Patriotic Strength from the Aid-to-Suiyuan Movement</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>In the eyes of a group of old-fashioned people, women are different from men in status. Apart from holding children and taking care of cooking and sewing at home, they should not be involved in any work. It is even more out of the question to say that they have obligations to fulfill and rights to enjoy for the country and society. However, the fact is not like this. Women have their own considerable strength, which we cannot underestimate. Especially in the matter of the aid-to-Suiyuan movement, we have clearly seen what the strength of women is.</p>
<p>Since the bandits and puppets attacked Suiyuan, and the people of the whole country unanimously participated in the aid-to-Suiyuan work, the women's circles did not lag behind. In Shanghai, the leaders of various women's groups united to organize the "Women's Circles Suiyuan Bandit Suppression and慰勞(wèiláo) Association", running around and calling for donations and various useful items to comfort the soldiers at the front. The results achieved by the ladies participating in the aid-to-Suiyuan work are also very impressive. There are also female students from various schools who have stopped classes to sew silk-cotton vests. Many women who are studying medicine want to go to the front line to serve and rescue the wounded. Even the female workers in silk factories and yarn factories donate their labor income for aid to Suiyuan. Moreover, many poor girls voluntarily knit wool to make a living and donate to the front. Therefore, the aid-to-Suiyuan movement can be said to have become widespread throughout the women's circles, and the strength is certainly not small. Shanghai is like this, and the women's circles in the inland are just like Shanghai, not lagging behind in saving the country.</p>
<p>Here, what is the patriotic strength of women? It has clearly told us in participating in the aid-to-Suiyuan movement. Originally, the 450 million people of China, if women are removed, the number of men is probably less than half. Therefore, if only men are allowed to do the aid-to-Suiyuan movement, the actual effect obtained will probably be less than half. On the other hand, if women also rise up to participate, the strength will increase a lot. In this extraordinary period, to demand the self-reliance of the Chinese nation, it is only possible to save the nation by having the entire nation, regardless of men, women, old and young, each contribute their own strength and participate in practical work. Then how can we underestimate women!</p>
<h3>Excerpts from Women's Lives in Various Regions</h3>
<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>The author recently interviewed several female students from different regions, asking them to share the state of women's lives in their respective areas. I have omitted the many clichés, but have selected specific aspects of their active lives and presented them as fragments. If further information is gathered in the future, it will be contributed to our readers.</p>
<p>Enshi County, Hubei Province: The area is extremely impoverished, a very underdeveloped lower county. There are a few folk rhymes circulating in Enshi County: "No three days of sunshine, no three feet of flat land, no three taels of silver for the people." This describes the excessive rainfall, unsuitable for farming, resulting in barren land and poor people. No one owns more than three taels of silver, illustrating the extent of the poverty. Women in Enshi are physically strong, accustomed to labor, carrying loads of eighty or ninety catties on their shoulders, which is commonplace. Women manage both household and external affairs, taking charge of family finances and engaging in outside business. Women are found in all sorts of places. The men smoke and gamble, making it a routine, becoming idle and indulging themselves at home. Outsiders might mistakenly think they were in Korea upon witnessing such indolent and degenerate behavior. They don’t rely on their husbands! Many men are actually dependent on their wives! They don't wear any ornaments from head to toe, maintaining their natural appearance.</p>
<p>Java, Dutch East Indies: These few words certainly cannot represent the entire lives of Javanese women, let alone the women of the entire Dutch East Indies. The local gentry value men over women, a deeply ingrained habit that is hard to reverse. Educated women are as rare as phoenix feathers and enjoy a more privileged life. Ordinary women still till the fields, plant crops, or climb mountains to chop firewood. Many also go to the market to do business, supplementing the family income. Elderly women manage the meals. Middle-aged and young women, lacking enough food and clothing, go to foreigners' homes during the day or at night to give massages, earning a few cents to support their lives. This massage work is said to be very common, with women soliciting business door-to-door as a routine matter. However, it is limited to massage only and cannot be compared to the popular tuina or massage in domestic cities.</p>
<p>Chaozhou, Guangdong: Women's revolutionary ideas are extremely surging. Their actions are progressive, unwilling to fall behind. They engage in women's movements, not allowing metropolitan areas to claim exclusive rights. Poor women work all day to achieve economic independence. Women from wealthy families are also unwilling to sit idle and must find some easy crafts. They believe that "humans are working animals! We women are humans! Therefore, we should work!" They consider labor to be the duty of a human being.</p>
<p>Tiger Beach, Dalian: Tiger Beach is near the coast, and most residents are fishermen. Women living in this environment naturally put effort into "fishing." They twist ropes and weave nets, making it a year-round source of income. A few women also fish with the men. When the husbands and brothers set out to fish, they are usually gone for several days. The women prepare some palatable dishes in advance, providing them with several days of food. Before they leave, the women line the coast, seeing them off. Young couples often exchange kisses and say many auspicious words. When the boats are about to return, the women prepare the containers to load the fish in advance. If the return is delayed, they fear they have encountered danger at sea! They silently weep all day or piously go to the temple to worship Buddha.</p>
<h3>Contribution from the Conscience</h3>
<h3>Newspaper-selling Women in Changzhou City</h3>
<p>— Jun Ying</p>
<p>Even if women in Changzhou know a few words, are beautiful, and of marriageable age, there are very few opportunities for them. Recently, a certain newspaper office recruited literate women to sell newspapers, considering it a new foundation for promoting women's occupations. Once this trend started, other newspapers competed to follow suit. For a time, in the lonely city, one could often see these young women, heavily made up, selling newspapers in large quantities, which was truly novel and could be compared to the flower-selling girls of Suzhou.</p>
<p>Speaking of their lives, they experience a great deal of pain, both mentally and materially. Every day, they carry rolls of newspapers, selling them to passersby in a gentle voice. One can often see them selling newspapers to customers in poor streets, remote alleys, teahouses, and hotels.</p>
<p>Their monthly salary is only eight or nine yuan. Aside from a small portion spent on cosmetics and clothing, most of it is given to support the family. Despite the meager pay, they are still required to have a graceful figure, be literate, and be able to announce the news printed in the daily newspaper to be fortunate enough to be hired by the newspaper office.</p>
<p>Corrupt elements in society are inevitable. They are often deceived by money or other reasons and are often exploited. Some even pretend to buy newspapers to flirt with them intentionally. They experience a great deal of mental anguish. The difficulty of women standing on their own in society in the interior is apparent.</p>
<p>Please save on cosmetics and help the soldiers on the front lines fighting the enemy!</p>
<p>Please sew cotton clothes and send them to the soldiers in the snowy front lines!</p>
<p>Please study first aid techniques and prepare to serve on the front lines!</p>
<h3>To: Sisters Who Are First-Time Mothers!</h3>
<p>— Pei Lu</p>
<p>Ten Commandments for Child Rearing</p>
<p>Young sisters! As you become a mother for the first time and raise your own little angel, I know that you not only have no experience to make your child fat, strong, lively, and adorable, but also may expose your child to unexpected dangers. Therefore, here I will write down some common knowledge about raising a child for the first time!</p>
<p>㊀ Do not feed the child with your mouth, because adults' mouths often contain bacteria that can be transmitted to the child. The child's resistance is weak, which can easily lead to illness and is very dangerous!</p>
<p>㊁ When the child cries, do not immediately breastfeed. First, feeding when the child is angry can hinder digestion. Second, when the child is still sobbing, it is easy to inhale milk into the trachea, causing coughing.</p>
<p>㊂ In winter, do not cover the child's head in the quilt during sleep. Children, like adults, need fresh air.</p>
<p>㊃ When the child wants to sleep, do not shake them excessively to urge them to fall asleep sooner, because it will make their head dizzy and eventually numb. Even after falling asleep, they often cry or laugh in their dreams. You should let them fall asleep naturally.</p>
<p>㊄ Children's nerves are very sensitive and easily startled. Therefore, they should sleep in a quiet place during the day, and noisy places should be avoided nearby.</p>
<p>㊅ Do not let the child's eyes stare straight or squint at a certain place for a long time to avoid creating crossed eyes or squint eyes.</p>
<p>㊆ Do not let the child put their hands in their mouth to avoid unnecessary loss of saliva and to avoid more opportunities to contact illnesses.</p>
<p>㊇ When the child's legs are not strong enough, do not force them to stand upright to avoid injury to the joints or creating X-shaped legs or Q-shaped legs.</p>
<p>㊈ In summer, in addition to breastfeeding, you should give them more boiled water, because children also sweat a lot and consume a lot of water. Do not just use milk to satisfy hunger and quench thirst. Eating too much milk easily causes indigestion.</p>
<p>㊉ Children's clothes, whether in winter or summer, should be loose and not too small to avoid hindering breathing and harming the lungs.</p>
<p>That's all! I offer these ten pieces of common sense about child-rearing to all the young sisters!</p>
<h3>"Misses' Must-Knows"</h3>
<p>— Hu Yeyin</p>
<p>Recently, I have seen many articles like "Misses' Must-Knows" in publications combining text and illustrations. After reading them, I often have a bad feeling. For example, in a publication called "Miss," I found a gentleman setting down many rules as if they were laws. I will copy a few below:</p>
<p>If you dream of kissing a man, then quickly beware of meeting a swindler soon.</p>
<p>Pay attention to the man's hand moving onto your body, he will definitely stop at many stations.</p>
<p>When you like to eat sour things, eat them less in front of men.</p>
<p>In spring, avoid touching soft things; in summer, avoid touching sticky things.</p>
<p>If you are studying at a co-educational school, you might as well not answer when male professors ask you questions.</p>
<p>It is best not to eat bananas, as this will cause you to lose the beauty of your finger curves.</p>
<p>When you see a flower, you should think that someone will come to pick it temporarily.</p>
<p>Okay! Okay! I don't need to copy anymore. I must save the time of the printer because these things are basically worthless. Their value, besides giving bored ladies of the leisure class something to pass the time after meals, is simply useless.</p>
<p>Moreover, judging from the few rules copied above, some are simply unreasonable, such as the first one. Some are just saying witty things. I believe that some young women may get angry after reading them.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, young women have awakened themselves and demanded their own status, shouting for equality and wanting to break free from the shackles of men. Being men's playthings is a great shame. But, it has already been twenty-five years of the Republic of China! And the "Misses' Must-Knows" still contain such provisions. I can't help but sigh for the young women!</p>
<p>Everyone understands the position China is in now and what China needs now. Therefore, for the future of the nation and the future of the country, I cannot but blame the authors of the "Misses' Must-Knows," because they are irresponsible. They aim to cater to the needs of the leisure class, and they ignore the needs of the times. After scolding them severely, I will write another "Misses' Must-Knows" as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Pay attention to your own position, pay attention to your surroundings; beware of those insidious poisonous arrows.</p>
<p>㊁ When you are truly bored, do not read publications combining text and illustrations of the "Miss" type.</p>
<p>㊂ Do your part to eliminate all the poisonous arrows for your female compatriots; start a great cleaning movement.</p>
<p>㊃ Men and women are originally the same people. Women do not need to hide and dodge in front of men. On the contrary, they should be like men, acting as the vanguard of the times!</p>
<p>㊄ Losing the beauty of curves is not a woman's shame, but those who make you lose your soul are your mortal enemies!</p>
<p>㊅ Spring is the time for growth, and summer is the time for flourishing. Therefore, the beginning of spring should have good plans, and the arrival of summer is precisely when the work is most intense.</p>
<p>Okay! Okay! I can stop here too! The more I write, the more there is, but the most important thing is still that I hope my female compatriots value themselves, work hard for the country and for the nation, move forward, and seek the path to light!</p>

<h3>Hangyu Section Replaces Heavy Rails: Formal Signing of an 8.8 Million Yuan Loan Contract</h3>
<p>Silver group 2.8 million yuan, materials 6 million yuan, term 6 years, interest 9% and 4%</p>
<p>Rail replacement project scheduled to begin in mid-June and be completed.</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau decided to replace the 35-pound light rails of the Hangyu section with 63-pound heavy rails, so that it could uniformly run heavy trains with the Yunan and Nanping sections. Zhang Zili, secretary of the council of the bureau, repeatedly contacted Jin Runquan, representative of the China, China Farmers, and Zhejiang Local banks and manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China. Jin came to Shanghai and reported to the head office, after which the Bank of China agreed to borrow 1.8 million yuan, and the China Farmers and Zhejiang Local banks each agreed to borrow 500,000 yuan. A draft agreement was first signed in Hangzhou on December 2 of last year, and after the bureau submitted it for approval at a council meeting held in Beijing on December 8 of the same month, the contract was officially signed at the end of the month.</p>
<p>Contract Summary</p>
<p>The main points of the loan contract are as follows: ㊀ Loan name: Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Hangyu Section Rail Replacement Loan, 2.8 million yuan in national currency; ㊁ Lending banks: Bank of China lends 1.8 million yuan, China Farmers Bank and Zhejiang Local Bank each lend 500,000 yuan; ㊂ Guarantee: The balance of the first phase of railway construction bonds and the increased passenger and freight income after the Hangyu section is replaced with heavy rails will be used as a guarantee; ㊃ Term and interest: Monthly interest rate of 9%; after the Yunan section loan is repaid, it will be repaid in installments over six years; ㊄ The Bank of China is designated as the representative of the syndicate. The signing representatives are Zeng Yangfu, chairman of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau Council, Jin Runquan, manager of the Hangzhou branch of the Bank of China, Wu Jingsheng, director of the Hangzhou office of the China Farmers Bank, and Xu Enpei, general manager of the Zhejiang Local Bank. There are four copies of the contract, each held by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, Bank of China, China Farmers Bank, and Zhejiang Local Bank, for record and reference.</p>
<p>Material Loan</p>
<p>In addition to the engineering costs for the Hangyu section's heavy rail replacement, which are borrowed from the Shanghai syndicate, all steel rails, sleepers, and other materials, totaling 28,000 tons and equivalent to 6 million yuan in national currency, have been negotiated by Zeng Yangfu and Chen Hualin, director of the Iron Department Purchasing Committee, with the Shanghai representative of the Czech merchant "Wisun Weis" (transliteration) steel mill. The supply is generally provided by the factory, with an annual interest rate of 4% and a term of six years. The contract has also been signed. The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau issues promissory notes in accordance with the contract and repays the principal and interest in installments over six years. The Ministry of Railways serves as the guarantor. The required materials are notified to the factory's representative in Shanghai, who forwards them to the Czech Republic and ships them to China and Hangzhou for application as needed, depending on the needs of the project.</p>
<p>Starting Rail Replacement</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau was ordered to complete the Nanping section project by the end of March of this year. After the syndicate released the funds in advance, the progress of various projects was quite rapid and is expected to be completed on schedule by the end of March. The 25-pound light rails used in the Hangyu section are now being replaced with 63-pound heavy rails in sections. During the rail replacement period, passenger and freight trains on the Hangyu section will continue to operate as usual to facilitate traffic. It is expected that the entire replacement will be completed by mid-June, at which time the Hangyu, Yunan, and Nanping sections will be fully completed, and heavy trains with weights of 35 tons and 45 tons can be run, which will greatly facilitate passenger and freight transportation.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Businessman Wu Zhuxuan Arrives in Shanghai from Siam</h3>
<p>Negotiating the promotion of domestic products</p>
<p>Wu Zhuxuan, a tycoon of overseas Chinese in Siam and a member of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce, recently arrived in Shanghai to discuss with the domestic product industry in this port the promotion of domestic products in Siam. The Central News Agency reporter interviewed him and learned about the situation of overseas Chinese and domestic product sales in the area as follows:</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are Concerned about the Motherland</p>
<p>Mr. Wu first stated that the number of overseas Chinese in Siam reaches 2.5 million, which is the largest number of overseas Chinese in any region. In recent years, due to the impact of the global economic downturn, there have been occasional unemployment problems. The businesses they operate themselves are mainly textiles and groceries. In the past, they were very ignorant of the motherland. In recent years, due to inspection groups visiting one after another, and the fact that domestic politics have been put on the right track, they have expressed great concern.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Have Strong Influence</p>
<p>Siam is an agricultural country. In recent years, it has gradually paid attention to commerce, and its political aspects are also trying to revitalize. However, the commercial influence of Japanese people in Siam is extremely strong. Their business methods are very accommodating. At the beginning of sales of various goods, prices are not considered. After sales channels gradually expand, contracts are signed. The prices are also low, which cannot be matched by other countries. They also use various methods to encourage merchants to promote sales. For example, those who sell the most Japanese goods can travel to Japan for free. The Siamese authorities consider Japanese goods convenient and claim that they are sufficient to revitalize the economy.</p>
<p>Opinions on Promoting Domestic Products</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese are now very concerned about the motherland and are happy to use domestic products. However, the prices of domestic products are slightly higher, and manufacturers are afraid to operate boldly. He came here specifically to negotiate promotion matters and has met with several manufacturers several times. He is responsible for the affairs of the Domestic Products Joint Venture in Siam. Siamese overseas Chinese merchants prefer to trade directly with the manufacturers, as their procedures are simpler. Therefore, he also hopes that domestic product manufacturers will adopt direct transaction methods. The best-selling domestic products in Siam are daily necessities and textiles.</p>
<p>Looking Forward to China-Siam Navigation</p>
<p>He had heard about the China-Siam navigation and hoped it would be realized soon to promote the development of domestic products. The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association will establish a domestic products office in Singapore, which will be the hub for promoting domestic products in Southeast Asia. He will stay in Shanghai for a longer period and continue to negotiate everything with the domestic product industry.</p>

<p>According to banking circles here, Lu Zuofu, Director of the Construction Department of the Sichuan Provincial Government, came to Shanghai from Sichuan at the end of last year to negotiate with Shanghai banking circles about organizing a syndicate to invest in Sichuan. He visited leaders of major banks to discuss everything. The bank leaders, considering the great importance of financial adjustment in the interior and its close relationship with the banking industry itself, decided to transfer capital such as investment in real estate and foreign exchange to the interior to adjust rural finance.

<h3>Workers at Japanese-owned Asia Steel Weaving Factory Resumed Work Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The factory has agreed to appropriately increase wages.</p>
<p>"Ta Kung Pao" reports that all the workers at the Japanese-owned Asia Steel Weaving Factory at 379 Hejian Road, Yangshupu Road, Shanghai, went on strike on the morning of the 5th, protesting the factory's refusal to increase their wages, hoping to awaken the factory's awareness. Since the workers' strike, all work in the factory has been suspended. After consultation between the factory manager and the foremen, the workers were promised a reasonable wage increase, hoping that the workers would resume work first. The workers resumed work in the factory as usual yesterday morning, as their goal was achieved. The Chinese and Japanese detectives sent by the police were also withdrawn.</p>
<h3>American Shipping Strike Shows Signs of Resolution</h3>
<p>Sino-American Trade Greatly Affected</p>
<p>"The Continental Times" reports that American merchants here believe that the protracted American shipping strike is about to be resolved. According to telegraphic dispatches from the American private sector, labor and management are in negotiations and are about to reach an agreement. The extent to which Shanghai's commerce has been affected by this strike cannot be determined at this time. However, because Sino-American trade usually accounts for about a quarter of China's foreign commerce, the losses suffered by Shanghai must be substantial. In November of last year, goods imported from America totaled 16,903,869 yuan, and goods exported to America totaled 12,793,404 yuan. Sino-American trade totaled over 31 million yuan. Major American products such as raw cotton, steel, machinery and hardware products, vehicles, and lumber suffered the most. The losses suffered by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai who ship goods to America are almost equal to those of importers. Raw hides and plant products have been greatly affected because they cannot be loaded and unloaded in the United States. The American Commercial Counselor in China, Mr. Arnold, and Mr. Ho of the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai both telegraphed the relevant departments of their country on New Year's Eve last year about the situation of Shanghai's suffering.</p>

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Deputy Manager Tan Boying Submits Resignation</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Mr. Tan Boying, Deputy Manager of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, recently resigned to the Ministry of Transportation. After hearing the news, the reporter immediately inquired in all directions. It is understood that the Ministry of Transportation had previously sent Cai Zengying as General Manager and Lian Boying as Deputy Manager to thoroughly reorganize the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which had been poorly managed, to benefit shipping. Deputy Manager Tan Boying is a German-trained mechanical expert with considerable experience in shipping and a meticulous approach to work. Therefore, since his arrival, he has adopted scientific management methods and designed many of the latest style ocean-going vessels. Recently, he has been working hard to eliminate malpractices in warehouses and wharves and to rectify them. As a result, the various warehouse and wharf offices are quick and orderly, and there is absolutely no shortage of goods, which is greatly welcomed by customers. His impartiality and selflessness are greatly admired by all parties. However, Tan has felt difficulties in his work since taking office. Although he has been very tolerant and hardworking, the results have not been satisfactory. Fearing that this would fail to meet the Ministry's expectations, he went to Beijing on the 5th of this month, after the completion of the warehouse and wharf reorganization, and submitted his resignation to Minister Yu. Although he was persuaded to stay, Tan was determined to leave and has submitted a written resignation after returning to the Bureau, resigning from the positions of Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Director of the Warehouse Management Office, and instructing all staff to continue to work hard and fulfill their duties. At the same time, he also ordered the various warehouse offices to rush to prepare transfer inventories so that the transfer and unloading can be carried out as soon as the Ministry approves it. It is reported that Tan returned to the Municipal Ferry Management Office yesterday to work.</p>

<h3>Shen Xin Labor Union Mediation - Shen Xin No. 8 Factory Resumes Work Last Night</h3>
<p>Labor and management agree on four measures; further negotiation on the conditions proposed by the labor side.</p>
<p>The workers in the reeling and spinning departments of Shen Xin Textile Company's No. 8 Factory in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, went on strike due to objections to the factory's wages and disregard for work records. After the Shanghai City Party Headquarters and the General Labor Union representatives persuaded them all night, they finally resumed work at 1:30 AM the night before. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>All-Night Persuasion</p>
<p>After the reeling and spinning departments of No. 8 Factory experienced another strike, the authorities feared that the dispute would escalate and involve other departments. Therefore, the Shanghai City Party Headquarters sent Lu Yinchu, a cadre of the People's Movement Section, and Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the General Labor Union, to Zhoujiaqiao overnight to jointly persuade both labor and management to prevent the dispute from escalating. The matter was resolved until after 1:00 AM late at night.</p>
<p>Resolution Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai City Party Headquarters and General Labor Union mediated and resolved the following four measures: (1) Starting from February 15th, wages will be clearly written on the work record. (2) The work hours of the fine spinning department on Sundays shall not exceed 9:00 AM the next morning. (3) Workers who are replaced or stopped shall be assigned work as soon as possible to avoid long waits. (4) The sweeper in the reeling department will be hired by the factory at its own expense; each worker will sweep within his or her own section. As for the six conditions, such as rewarding work, proposed separately by the labor side, the workers will report to the Cotton Spinning Union of the Tenth District and then submit them to the Shanghai City Party Headquarters and General Labor Union for negotiation and resolution with the factory.</p>
<p>Full Resumption of Work</p>
<p>The workers in each department expressed satisfaction with the resolution measures and resumed work. At 1:30 AM yesterday morning, all the workers in the night shift reeling and spinning departments resumed work as usual, maintaining good order. More than 30 policemen stationed in the factory for protection were withdrawn after the workers resumed work.</p>

<h3>Housing Tax Should Be Levied Based on Rent</h3>
<p>Taxpayers Association Sends Letter to Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday stating: "We have received a letter from the No. 24 branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' United Association stating that Chen Yongzhong, owner of Shuntaixing at 456 Beijing Road, was not being assessed the general tax based on rent by the Donation Office. We had previously written to your Council requesting that this be rectified. Now, the Donation Office has written to our members, asking them to bring the above-mentioned documents and Chen's outline. However, the Bureau still insists on 240 yuan as the standard and refuses to reduce the quarterly tax, resulting in no resolution. Our members leased these houses for the purpose of revitalizing the market and because the number of unemployed workers has increased sharply and their livelihoods are precarious. They leased the houses, which had been empty for a long time, to set up shops. This was intended to alleviate the above two points and was not intended to generate large profits. Otherwise, the example of Ni Jinfeng's original house at 425 Tonglu Road, which has been empty for many years and has no tenants, can serve as a warning. To whom should the tax on such vacant houses be collected? The Bureau has always been known for its civilization, and its staff are purely intellectuals and should be empathetic to the current difficult times and accommodate requests. However, they do not take this into account and forcibly increase the tax, willingly violating the reputation of civilized people, which is a pity. Our Association, with a fair stance, believes that such insatiable and harsh collection by the Bureau is abnormal. We are writing again, hoping that you will investigate and continue to write to the Donation Office, urging it to realize that the general tax should be levied according to the rent stipulated in the lease contract to show fairness and relief to merchants in difficulty. We are deeply grateful for your fairness. We are writing to the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council, urging it to broaden its vision and not use policies that will exhaust the tax base."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau Improves Two Telephone Locations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, due to the small number of users in Zhenru, has the exchange attached to Jinan University.

Therefore, with the approval of the Ministry of Transportation, the exchange was moved to the nearby Institute of Forensic Medicine and installed a hundred-line magneto switchboard to improve the situation. At the same time, the Wusong branch also moved to a new site at the intersection of Wai Guizhi Road and Jinguilu due to the large number of noises in the surrounding area, replacing two 50-line magneto switchboards with one 100-line switchboard to make it more convenient.</p>

<h3>Dr. Niishiro Calculates Confucius' Birthday</h3>
<p>Not August 27th, but October 3rd; Will Submit Request to the Chinese Government for Correction</p>
<p>The Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily" reports that world historians have doubts about the birthday of Confucius. Although the Chinese government has set it on August 27th, it is still difficult to determine the date from a historical perspective. Dr. Niishiro, of the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences, suddenly discovered the correct date: the birthday of the sage has been said to be the 21st year of Duke Xiang of Lu (552 BC) and the 22nd year of Duke Xiang (551 BC). It has also been said that he was born in October or November. The date of his death has been said to be April Yichou in the 16th year of Duke Ai (479 BC) or May Yichou. Scholars of the past have debated endlessly and have been unable to determine the exact date. Dr. Niishiro, after years of research, has determined that Confucius' birthday was the 21st day of the tenth month, Gengzi, of the 21st year of Duke Xiang of Lu." He said that this day, calculated according to the current solar calendar, is October 3, 552 BC. According to the "Spring and Autumn Continued Classics" and "Zuo Zhuan," he lived to the age of 74 on the 11th day of April Yichou of the 16th year of Duke Ai of Lu, which, calculated by the solar calendar, is March 4, 479 BC, which is more than a month away from August 27th, which is currently set by the National Government. According to Dr. Niishiro, the research is based on the "Zuo Zhuan," "Gongyang Zhuan," "Gu Liang Zhuan," "Records of the Grand Historian," "Shi Ben" and other documents. The "Zuo Zhuan," "Gongyang Zhuan," and "Gu Liang Zhuan" all say that he was born in the year Gengzi, the twenty-first year of Duke Xiang. And "Shi Ben" and "Records of the Grand Historian" all say the year Gengzi of the twenty-second year. If the day is Gengzi, then regardless of the twenty-first or twenty-second year, the month must be October. The November of Gongyang Zhuan is not Gengzi, but October Gengzi. As for the year of birth, Gongyang and Gu Liang are both the twenty-first year. If we quote Confucius’ commentary on Xiangong in Zuo Fu's thirty-first year, then Jian Da’s saying that Xiangong died in the twenty-first year is mathematically contradictory. Because if it was born in the twenty-first year of Xiangong (552 BC), then in the sixteenth year of Duke Ai (479 BC), he was 74 years old, not 73 years old. Du Yu’s twenty-first year of Xiangong and Xiangong’s sixteenth year records the twenty-second year. However, in Zhaogong's seventh year, Zhaogong said that Confucius was 35 years old in the twenty-fourth year and 28 years old in the seventeenth year of Zhaogong (525 BC), all of which are mathematically contradictory with the twenty-first year of Xiangong. Those who passed it as the twenty-second year based it on Shiji Shiben, but the book Shiben is unreliable, so after detailed research on astronomy and calendar numbers, there is no doubt that it is October 3. During Niishiro's research, he expressed his opinion eight years ago. After that, he continued his research and concluded that it was indeed correct. He will soon submit a request to the Nanjing National Government for correction.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Handling Ocean Transportation</h3>
<p>In order to manage China's ocean cargo movement and transit business, the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has established an Ocean Shipping Office at 133 Yuanmingyuan Road in Shanghai and has established agencies in major commercial ports overseas for handling matters. In order to clarify the purpose of the Ocean Shipping Office organization to the Shanghai shipping industry, the company invited representatives of Chinese and foreign shipping merchants at the office on December 29th to hold a discussion meeting. Zeng Guangqing, the resident of the Business Section of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, reported that the motive for establishing the Ocean Shipping Office was to implement the resolution of the Executive Yuan on July 3, 1936. The resolution stipulated that all military and political agencies of China's central, provincial, and municipal governments should entrust the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to handle the transportation of goods and materials ordered from foreign countries. Therefore, the purpose of the association is to make the shipping merchants understand the business operated by the office and to hope that the shipping merchant representatives will cooperate and provide practical assistance to achieve the government's wishes. It is also reported that the Ocean Shipping Office also handles the transportation of goods and materials exported from China.</p>

<h3>Winner of Thousand-Yuan Prize from Empty Bag of Invincible Tooth Powder</h3>
<p>Inside the bottle of Butterfly Cream Toothpaste produced by the Home Industry Society, there was a small glass tube containing a huge amount of prize money, which was discovered in Lanzhou in January of last year. In order to promote the interest of domestic goods, the company issued empty boxes of Butterfly Cream Toothpaste and empty bags of tooth powder to exchange for prize tickets. The first prize was 1,000 yuan. The first period of prize tickets was drawn in public on December 31st of last year. The first prize was 194744. It was found that the prize ticket was given out by Guangchang Store on Tianzhutang Street in Shanghai. In a few days, the winner, Mr. Lin Tianxiang, went to redeem it. Mr. Lin is from Yongding County, Fujian Province, and is an apprentice at the Gonghexing Cigarette Shop on Xin Kaihe Road in Shanghai. He has been working in the store for more than a year and usually likes to use Invincible brand products. This time, he only used ten empty bags of Invincible brand tooth powder to exchange for prize tickets at Guangchang Store on Tianzhutang Street and won the first prize. He was overjoyed and has now received a bank check for 1,000 yuan in national currency from the company. It is learned that Mr. Lin, in addition to his store work, loves art. He said that he will deposit part of the prize money in the Gonghexing Cigarette Shop and support his parents, and part of it will be used to study art in order to pursue further studies.</p>

<h3>Did Not Deny Descendant, Why Unnecessarily Litigate</h3>
<p>Li Genfa, a local resident residing at No. 6 Tangjiabang, Pudong, 28 years old, filed a lawsuit in the local court against his grandmother Li Huang (70 years old, residing at No. 1, Lane 16, Renji Road, Lannidu) seeking confirmation of their relationship as descendant and grandmother. The lawsuit stated that Li Changshou, the grandmother's late husband, had no descendants and therefore adopted the plaintiff's father, Mao Mao, as his adopted son in June of the 27th year of the Guangxu reign. When Changshou passed away in the 10th year of the Republic of China, Mao Mao observed the rituals of mourning. Mao Mao also passed away in September of the 11th year of the Republic of China, and all the expenses were borne by the plaintiff. (However, the defendant, now advanced in years, was instigated by others, blinded by greed, and attempted to infringe upon the plaintiff's status, disregarding the dependence of ancestral spirits on offerings and sacrifices.) Yesterday, Judge Wang Run held a court session. Neither party was present; instead, lawyers represented them. After the plaintiff's lawyer, Qu Zheng, stated the case, the defendant's lawyer, Zhang Feitai, stated that after the death of the defendant's husband, Li Changshou, Li Mao Mao acquired his identity, and now the plaintiff is the descendant, and no one disputes this, so there is no need to sue. The judge then said to the plaintiff's lawyer, "Since there is no dispute, there is no problem." The plaintiff's lawyer said, "There is a reason for filing the lawsuit." The judge said that there was no need to litigate any further, and an amicable settlement was recorded in court, with the plaintiff bearing the litigation costs. A lawsuit that came out of nowhere thus came to an end.</p>

<h3>Pudong Lannidu Fire Pudong Lannidu Fire</h3>
<p>Cigarette Paper Shop and Soy Sauce Shop Catch Fire One After Another, Suspicious Circumstances Surround Soy Sauce Shop's Tightly Closed Doors</p>
<p>At half past midnight the day before yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out at the F茂 Cigarette Paper Shop at the intersection of Jiangjia Alley on Lannidu Police Station Road in Pudong. At that late hour, when everything was quiet, nearby residents were awakened from their sleep. Upon seeing the flames engulfing the roof of the shop, they were terrified. In addition to the cold weather, everyone was trembling with fear. Cries filled the air as people scrambled to rescue their belongings, blocking the roads. The Pudong Branch Bureau and the Yangjing District Defense Corps dispatched police and guards to the scene to maintain order, which improved slightly. As the fire at the cigarette paper shop subsided, the adjacent Song Sheng Soy Sauce Shop caught fire, burning even more fiercely. By then, the Pudong District Fire Department had dispatched fire engines to the scene. Fire engines from Laobaidu and Yangjing District arrived shortly after. Because the Song Sheng Soy Sauce Shop's doors were tightly closed, it was impossible to extinguish the fire. As a result, the flames grew even larger, reaching high into the sky. Even ten miles away, the red glow in the sky could be seen, showing how intense the fire was. Half an hour later, the bungalow opposite the fire and the building in the Soy Sauce Shop Alley to the east were successively engulfed in flames. Firefighters concentrated their efforts to extinguish the flames. It was not until three o'clock yesterday morning that the fire was gradually brought under control. However, embers remained smoldering inside the fire area. From ten o'clock yesterday morning to two o'clock in the afternoon, despite the heavy rain, the fire rekindled twice, exhausting the firefighters. In total, two buildings of the F茂 shop, one workshop, two bungalows of the Song Sheng shop, three buildings in Soy Sauce Shop Alley, one Zhao Xinji clothing store, one Yang Tongxing cotton shop, and one Yang Kunshan barber shop were destroyed. In total, six buildings and five bungalows were destroyed. The total amount of the loss is still difficult to determine. The cause of the fire has not yet been determined. However, nearby residents pointed out that the F茂 company had jointly insured 5,600 yuan of fire insurance with the Xiangtai Insurance Company and the Weilie Insurance Company. The Song Sheng Soy Sauce Shop had insured 6,000 yuan alone. The fact that firefighters could not force open the tightly closed doors of the Song Sheng Soy Sauce Shop led to speculation and dissatisfaction with both shops. Zhang Mingqin, head of the Pudong Police Branch Bureau, believing the loss to be significant, ordered Fan Dongyuan, the Ningbo manager of the F茂 company, to be brought to the bureau for questioning to investigate the truth about the fire. Recognizing the need for further investigation, he ordered him to be sent to the General Bureau for review yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Assassin of Tang Youren Has Confessed</h3>
<p>But Asks Court to Show Leniency</p>
<p>Tang Youren, former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs from Hunan, was shot and killed by thugs in front of his private residence on Gansidong Road in the French Concession on December 25th of the year before last (24th year of the Republic). After the authorities offered rewards for the arrest of the perpetrators, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police successively captured the actual gunmen in the case, Liu Zhennan and Qiu Jiyu. Because the incident occurred in the French Concession, the French Concession Police dispatched detectives to bring the two suspects back and send them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. After several interrogations, the French Concession Police Department stated that the investigation procedures in this case were quite complicated and time-consuming, so they repeatedly requested the court to extend the deadline. All these circumstances have been reported in this newspaper. Now, the French Concession Police Department has completed the investigation procedures in this case, such as the investigation report, the confessions of the two defendants, and the testimony of witnesses, as well as the files of the Municipal Police Bureau and the Public Concession Police. The details were complicated and were only completed the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, Wang Gangxu, Chief of the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, along with clerk Gao Yanmao, presided over the first criminal court and brought the two defendants for further interrogation. The Police Department's lawyer, relying on Article 271 of the Criminal Law on murder, prosecuted Liu and Qiu and stated in detail the prior consultation and planning by the two defendants as confessed to the Police Department, as well as the details of how they carried out the assassination of Tang Youren and then escaped before being arrested. The court then interrogated Liu and Qiu based on this information, and both frankly confessed to conspiring to kill Tang Youren and admitted that they were driven by patriotism to kill the traitor. Finally, they both confessed that they regretted being exploited and committing this illegal act, and they begged the court to show leniency because they had elderly mothers and young siblings at home. The court also summoned witnesses such as Shan Jinbiao, the gatekeeper at No. 232 Gansidong Road. They also asked Liu and Qiu whether they would hire lawyers for their defense. Both defendants said that they could not afford to hire lawyers, that they had already confessed to the crime, and only asked the court to show leniency. Chief Judge Wang reviewed the confession and announced that the hearing would be adjourned to the 19th to appoint defense lawyers for further questioning. The defendants were then taken into custody.</p>
<h3>Notorious Thieves Arrested in Liangxi Hotel</h3>
<p>Handguns and Bullets Confiscated</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, Chief Inspector of the Public Concession Police Headquarters, recently learned that several bandits were hiding in Room 21 of the Liangxi Hotel at No. 144 Hubei Road, possessing dangerous weapons and plotting illegal activities. Therefore, at 3:20 p.m. the day before yesterday, he led Detective Wang Chengying, Detective Wang Jinsheng, and others fully armed to arrest them. Huang Hongsheng, also known as Wang Bin, Huang Kai, and Huang Jinling, 33 years old, from Ningbo, residing somewhere in the Southern City, and Song Genfa, also known as Gongfa, 28 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 286 Hed Road, were arrested in Room 21 of the hotel. An Austrian-style handgun, seven bullets, a magazine, and a bomb were confiscated and taken back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court Criminal Division 1. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, explained the circumstances of the arrest and stated that because they still needed to arrest accomplices and investigate the crime, he requested permission to detain them for a week for further interrogation. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the report and questioned the two suspects, and then ordered them to be remanded to custody and the hearing adjourned for a week for further review.</p>
<h3>Wife Sues Wang Naiwu for Adultery After He Takes a Concubine</h3>
<p>Wang Naiwu, from Chuansha, also known as Wang Zulan, 42 years old, previously married a woman named Xi Taolin from the same village. Xi is 39 years old and has two sons. They live together at No. 3 Anfeng Li, Julai Da Road, in the French Concession. Wang is a partner in a bookstore at No. 26 Shandong Road. Recently, Wang's wife, Xi, learned that her husband, Wang Naiwu, was having an affair and had built a "golden house" on the third floor of No. 29 Zhenhua Li, Malang Road. Therefore, the night before last, she reported to the French Concession Police, who dispatched Detective Xu Jintang to the location and arrested Wang and his mistress, Zhang Jubao (21 years old, from Lili, Wujiang), and took them to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhu Chuzhe interrogated them. The Police Department lawyer, Yao Zhao Di, explained the case and prosecuted them for adultery under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. Then, the plaintiff, Wang's wife Xi, stated the circumstances, saying that after her husband had an affair, he often came home and beat her, causing her to be injured and vomit blood. Now, she found out that her husband and the second defendant were committing adultery, rented a house, and lived together, so she requested that they be severely punished according to the law. Wang Naiwu confessed that as a merchant doing bookstore business, he often went to other ports to promote sales. In March of last year, he went to Lili Town and, to seek emotional comfort, asked a friend to introduce him to Zhang Jubao as a concubine. At that time, he paid 300 yuan in betrothal money and brought her to Shanghai. First, he asked his wife to live with her, but she refused, so he rented another house to live separately. However, his relationship with his wife was outwardly harmonious, but his younger brother stirred up trouble and caused him to suffer greatly emotionally. This has been mediated by friends, which can be proven. Zhang Jubao said that she married Wang as a concubine, which can be proven, and that she was not just having an affair. She did not know that Wang had a wife until October of this year. If Wang Naiwu does not want her as a concubine, he must pay her alimony for life. Then, witnesses Zhu Linsheng and Shen Yucheng testified that they had mediated between Wang and his wife, because Wang's property was managed by Xi, and they advised Xi to pay Wang Naiwu 40 yuan a month for expenses, but Xi did not agree to the concubine living with them. The court reviewed the confessions and stated that the case was clear and should be concluded after arguments. The sentencing was scheduled for the 15th. The two defendants were released on bail, and the two parties were told that they could try to reach a settlement outside of court.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Downstream Seven Miles, Haiyi and Qingning Collide</h3>
<p>Qingning Severely Damaged, Runs Aground, Both Sides Send Representatives for Inspection</p>
<p>The Qingning of the Shanghai Hwaning Shipping Company, weighing 1951 tons, 275 feet in length, 36 feet and 2 inches in width, 21 feet and 5 inches in depth, 17 feet and 3 inches in draft, and a speed of 9 knots per hour, was sailing from Shanghai to Huangshigang in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River to load coal. At 6:14 p.m. on the 7th, when it was nearly seven miles downstream from Nanjing, it was already dark and snowing, making navigation on the misty river more difficult. At this time, the Haiyi of the Shanghai Huashang Shipping Company, weighing 3154 tons, 331 feet and 8 inches in length, 43 feet in width, 24 feet and 9 inches in depth, 20 feet and 2 inches in draft, and a speed of 11 knots per hour, was carrying coal from Huainan downstream to Shanghai. After passing Nanjing, when it was near the Qingning, the river surface was obscured by snowflakes, and neither side could see each other. When they got closer, the two ships were directly heading towards each other on a straight line. Although they wanted to avoid each other, it was too late. The Qingning was hit head-on by the Haiyi, causing the left side of the Qingning's bow to be damaged. The first and second holds immediately ruptured and were pierced, and river water rushed in. Seeing that the front half of the ship was about to sink after water entered the first two holds, the shipowner urgently sped to the riverbank to run aground to avoid sinking. After the accident, the shipowner immediately telegraphed Shanghai, saying, "The Qingning was hit by the Haiyi ship seven miles downstream from Nanjing at 6:14 p.m. on the 7th. The left side of the bow is leaking badly, and the damage is severe. Measures have been taken to run aground to ensure safety." However, when the ship ran aground, because the speed was too high, it hit a sailboat, which was damaged by the Qingning. The Haiyi was also damaged in the bow compartment, but it did not affect navigation. The ship has now sailed downstream to Shanghai and will unload the cargo and enter the dock for repairs. Hwaning Company reported the incident to the China United Ship Insurance Association yesterday. In order to understand the actual situation, Xu Zufan and Qingning shipowner Zhuang Huibo were dispatched to Nanjing on the same night to inspect the damage to the Qingning and the circumstances of the collision and to determine rescue measures.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Shen Lijuan Sues Husband for Bigamy</h3>
<p>Found to Be True After Interrogation, Defendant Released on Bail</p>
<p>Shen Lijuan, a young woman from Suzhou, 22 years old, sued Ni Lusheng, a silk broker from Liuzhaowan, Nanhui, 32 years old, in the local court for fraudulent marriage and bigamy. Yesterday, Judge Yu Lude held a court session to hear the case. Shen Lijuan stated that her mother's family lived on Yongxing Road, Zhabei. At the age of 19, on October 16th, she officially married Ni Lusheng through a matchmaker in Xicangqiao. Although she did not sit in a sedan chair, she rode in a decorated car. At that time, he said that he had no wife. But in March of last year, when she returned to her hometown to sweep the tombs, she discovered that the defendant had a wife, so she sued him for bigamy. The defendant, Ni Lusheng, stated that the marriage took place on October 16th of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The matchmakers were Lao Jin, Gu Zhongqing, Chen Erjie, and Laitou, but they were not officially married. Because his first wife had no children, he wanted to have an heir. The judge asked if they had worshiped heaven and earth. He replied, "We worshiped the Kitchen God, and I also paid respects to his father." The judge said, "In that case, it is undoubtedly an official marriage." He replied, "The one I have at home now is a second wife, and she has lung disease." The judge said, "Since you already had a wife, why did you marry her, and why did you lie that you had no wife?" He replied, "I explained it beforehand, and her godfather knew about it too. I paid 300 yuan in betrothal gifts." At this point, the judge asked Shen Lijuan about her relationship with Ni. She replied, "It's very ordinary, and he often beats and scolds me and doesn't give me money. When we got married, I only received 240 yuan of the betrothal gifts." At this point, the judge announced an adjournment for further questioning. The defendant was released on bail of 300 yuan.</p>

<h3>Married Woman Adultery Case Adjudicated Yesterday</h3>
<p>Adulterer and Adulteress Sentenced to Three Months Each, Fined 60 Yuan for Opium</p>
<p>Ding Shanming, a local resident, 28 years old, formerly graduated from the Literature Department of Jinan University. He opened Yilong Rice Shop in Hongqiao Town, Xujiahui. On March 11th of the 16th year of the Republic of China, he married Gu Cuizhen (29 years old), the niece of Gu Xiaoyan, a village elder in Hongqiao Town, and lived together at No. 25 Henan, Hongqiao Town. Recently, Ding Shanming learned that his wife was having an affair with Cao Zhongfu, a local real estate businessman residing at No. 45 Yidingpan Road, and they were meeting at Room 374 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. He reported this to the Laozha Police, who ordered detective Ye Yuxi to go to the Oriental Hotel and arrest Cao Zhongfu and Ding Gu. Fifty-three small pieces of opium and a licensed handgun were seized and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. This matter has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Dai Rongduo presided over the second criminal court to continue the hearing of the case. The defendants jointly hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yan Yinwu to appear in court and stated, "According to our lawyers, the plaintiff Ding Shanming intends to withdraw the charges against the defendant Ding Gu in this case. We request that this be inquired about first." Ding Shanming then stated that he must pursue the matter against both defendants and that he had no intention of withdrawing the charges. He also stated that the defendant Cao Zhongfu was his friend, and he had often seen him when he went to his wife's house. Witness Pan Ding stated, "Ding Shanming is my younger brother, and he has been married to Ding Gu for nine years. My brother has not taken a concubine or driven my sister-in-law Ding Gu out." Cao Zhongfu stated, "Gu Xiaoyan (deceased), the uncle of Ding Gu, was formerly my teacher, so I have known Ding Gu for more than ten years. But the relationship only started two years ago. I did not know that she was married. She often visited me at Puai Fang, Wuma Road, so we committed adultery." Ding Gu stated, "Cao Zhongfu was my late uncle's student. We met when he was studying. I married Ding Shanming at the age of 20. Two years later, my husband took a concubine and drove me out, causing me to live at my mother's house for seven years. He ignored my daily life and abandoned me. Therefore, I voluntarily followed Cao. In fact, Cao Zhongfu did not know that I had a husband. The opium seized by the police was purchased by Cao on my behalf because I had a stomach problem." Ding Shanming hired lawyer Gong Wenhuan to appear in court and filed a civil suit requesting that the two defendants jointly compensate him for losses of 385 yuan. After arguments between the police lawyer Jiang Baolian and the defendant's lawyer, Judge Dai ruled that Ding Gu committed adultery while married and was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. Cao Zhongfu committed adultery with a married person and was sentenced to three months of imprisonment. For possessing opium, he was fined 60 yuan. If the two defendants chose to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, one yuan would be equivalent to one day.</p>
<h3>British-Owned Public Bus Workers Oppose Lowering Year-End Bonus</h3>
<p>Demand That It Still Be Issued According to Previous Regulations</p>
<p>Dagong News reports that the British-owned China General Omnibus Company in the Public Concession has a customary practice of giving each worker a year-end bonus of one month's salary at the end of the lunar year to reward them. Now, the company has announced that it will cancel the old year-end bonus system and change it to 5% of the total annual salary. All the company's workers believe that this measure by the company reduces their original treatment by as much as 40%, so they are generally dissatisfied. The Drivers' Mutual Aid Association and the Ticket Sellers' Welfare Association have jointly requested the company to continue to handle matters according to the old regulations, but the company has not yet given a concrete reply.</p>
<h3>Dim Night Causes Fish Vendor Truck to Overturn, Hitting Electric Pole</h3>
<p>Eleven Fish Vendors Severely Injured, Man in Free Car in Critical Condition</p>
<p>Near the Ziqiupu Road Waterworks in Yangshupu, at around 3:40 a.m. yesterday, a fish vendor truck was traveling from Limma Road in the 16th Shed to the fish market to pick up goods. It was unexpected that the truck driver, driving through the area at night, did not have good visibility, and he was driving too fast. Due to carelessness, the truck crashed into an electric pole on the side of Ziqiupu Road, causing the entire truck to overturn. All the vendors on the truck were thrown more than ten feet away. The front of the truck was also badly damaged. At the same time, a man riding a free car happened to be passing by and was run over by the truck, immediately falling unconscious. Fortunately, after the accident, the police officers on duty heard about it and rushed to the scene. They saw more than ten fish vendors lying on the ground with serious injuries, moaning and screaming in pain. They urgently telegraphed the fire department to urgently call an ambulance to rush to the scene and fly the injured to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. At the same time, the police station in charge heard the news and dispatched detectives to the scene to assist in the rescue. It was not until about 5 o'clock that all the injured people were sent away one after another. The most seriously injured was the man riding the free car, who could not speak and whose name was unknown. He was in critical condition.

<h3>93-Year-Old British Woman Passes Away</h3>
<p>Mrs. Thiselton, Children Scattered Around the World</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that Mrs. Thiselton, a British woman, passed away on Thursday at her residence at No. 16 Yidingpan Road in this city, at the age of 93. Although Mrs. Thiselton was not the oldest foreign woman in China, it is believed that she was the oldest foreigner in Shanghai. Mrs. Thiselton was still healthy until recently. On September 22nd of last year, when she celebrated her 93rd birthday, representatives of her children and grandchildren gathered around her, filling the room. She was happy to see them. In her youth, Mrs. Thiselton was very active. Until a few years ago, she was often seen at the Shanghai Swimming Club, the French Club, and playing golf on the racecourse. Mrs. Thiselton was particularly concerned about the affairs of the British Women's Association and was a devout believer, attending church regularly. A week before her death, she was still attending church and praying. In recent months, she often rolled bandages for the British Women's Association to pass the time. Although Mrs. Thiselton had to sit quietly at home all day because of her old age and give up her former hard work, she was still mindful of beneficial things in the world due to her active nature. One of Mrs. Thiselton's daughters married a German and recently came to Shanghai to visit her. A granddaughter lives in Shanghai with her husband and has three children. All of Mrs. Thiselton's children are still alive and live in different parts of the world. One son used to be a customs officer in China and is now living in England after retirement. One son lives in Canada, and another daughter also lives in England. Mrs. Thiselton went to Canada seven years ago to visit her son when she was nearly 90 years old.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Expresses Condolences for Western Police Officer Killed in the Line of Duty</h3>
<p>On December 31st of last year, a burglary occurred at the Jingyun Building on Beijing Road, and the Shanghai Municipal Council's Western Police Officer Slyte was shot and killed by bandits on the spot. His father is currently a lieutenant colonel in the British colony of Victoria.

<h3>Landlords Should Immediately Report Tenants Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau is very strict on the issue of banning drugs and opium in the city. Not only are those who manufacture, sell, and consume drugs punished by military law, but those who consume opium without a license are also handled by military law. Recently, the bureau issued instructions to its branches that if landlords or second landlords conceal and fail to report private opium dens or the sale of opium for consumption, they will be prosecuted for harboring criminals. Recently, Wang Fubao, a police officer from the City God Temple Police Station, reported that a private opium den was selling opium to unlicensed opium smokers at No. 16 Fuyou Li, Danfeng Road. Director Yu immediately sent household registration inspector Chen Shusheng to lead the police to arrest several opium smokers. After handing them over to the bureau along with the evidence, the bureau issued an order yesterday to arrest and prosecute the second landlord for harboring criminals. After investigation, it was found that the second landlord of the house was a Ningbo woman named Xin Lu. They secretly went to arrest her, but she had already fled. They are now summoning Xin Lu's guarantor to the case to be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Bad Check Fraud</h3>
<p>Wang Xizhang, 26 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 12 Deshan Li, Xilin Road, is a partner in Hongyuan Box Factory. A few days ago, a fellow villager named Wei Siyou ordered 20,000 cigarette boxes, totaling more than 200 yuan. After the goods were picked up, Wei signed a check for 200 yuan from the Ken Ye Bank. When it was due, it was returned due to insufficient funds. Wang immediately looked for Wei, but he avoided him. It was obvious that he had issued a bad check. Yesterday, Wang passed by Minguo Road and encountered Wei Siyou. He immediately called policeman Wu Hengchang to take him to the City God Temple Police Station. After interrogation, it was found that the case involved using a bad check to defraud goods. He was sent to the General Bureau to be dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Review of the Completion of the Dharma Treasure Library by Buddhist Scholars</h3>
<p>Set to Hold Completion Ceremony Next Month; Di Chuqing Donates Song and Yuan Buddhist Statues</p>
<p>The Buddhist Pure Land Society at No. 418 Hartung Road in this city, considering the scarcity of Buddhist libraries in the country, which hinders scholars of Sanskrit scriptures due to the lack of resources for review, initiated the construction of a large-scale Buddhist library in the Jueyuan of Hart Road, naming it "Dharma Treasure," as previously reported. The construction of the library has now been completed and a completion ceremony will be held soon. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Construction Project</p>
<p>The Dharma Treasure Library is located in Jueyuan on Hart Road, covering an area approximately 40 feet wide and 70 feet deep. It is entirely constructed of steel and concrete, divided into three floors. The second floor houses the scripture section, and the third floor the Dharma object section. The library is surrounded by lush flowers and trees, creating a pleasant garden setting. The construction began in the summer of last year and has now been completed.</p>
<p>Completion Next Month</p>
<p>Regarding construction expenses, in addition to the generous donation of 10,000 taels (over 14,000 national currency yuan) from the former Minister of Transportation, Ye Gongchuo, the remaining funds were allocated from the public reserve fund of the Buddhist Pure Land Society. The completion ceremony is scheduled for mid-February of this year, with donations of Song and Yuan Buddhist statues and famous books from prominent figures such as Di Chuqing, including images of the three sages, Manjushri, and the Ming Dynasty Hongwu and Yongle imperial editions of the Tripitaka.</p>
<h3>Progress of the China Travel Service Tour Group</h3>

This is due to the well-organized nature and noble purpose of the group, with past achievements already recognized by all sectors. Recently, the group printed a large number of beautifully designed calendars, containing the dates and costs of various planned trips for the year, for distribution to members. Those interested in joining can contact the head office or branches for information and group regulations.</p>
<h3>Ho Shunen's Lawsuit to Recover Antiques Dismissed</h3>
<p>Nie Junwei Acquitted</p>
<p>Nie Junwei, the brother of the former Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Nie Yuntai, had four antique porcelain pieces deposited with his cousin, He Songwen, in the first year of the Republic. Now, more than twenty years later, He has passed away. He's son, Shunen, recently found a receipt written by Nie acknowledging the receipt of the four pieces, and demanded their return from Nie, without success. He then engaged lawyer Yuan Yangan to file a criminal lawsuit for embezzlement in the First Special District Court. Nie raised the issue of the statute of limitations, arguing that the plaintiff's lawsuit was time-barred and requesting a dismissal. After final arguments, Judge Pan Zhenyang, presiding over the case, announced the verdict in the Fifth Tribunal yesterday afternoon, acquitting Nie Junwei and dismissing the plaintiff's related civil suit.</p>

<h3>Shareholders of Jiuyi Hosiery Factory Sue Manager</h3>
<p>Zhang Ziliang, a shareholder of the closed Jiuyi Hosiery Factory, previously filed a public prosecution with the Second Special District Court against manager Wang Liwei for embezzlement. After Judge Wang of the Audit Court reviewed the case, he decided to postpone the hearing for further investigation, as reported previously. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang continued the hearing in the Second Criminal Court, first questioning Wang Liwei about various accounts. Wang replied that the amount of 10,359 yuan from the years of 1933 to 1935 was written off due to unpaid salaries and bonuses to merchants, as decided by the shareholders. There were other accounting issues that the merchant had not had time to thoroughly review. When asked if the accounting books had been handed over, Wang replied that all the books had been submitted to the accountant for auditing. At this point, lawyer Li Mo stated to the court that he now represented other shareholders, Zhu Xianqi, Chu Ganquan, Feng Jinzhang, Feng Canzhang, and thirteen other households, joining the lawsuit and demanding an additional civil suit for 39,909.90 yuan. The plaintiff, Zhang Ziliang, stated that the defendant had embezzled a total of over 65,000 yuan, and that he should be able to recover more than 6,500 yuan in his name. After reviewing the statements, Judge Wang decided to postpone the hearing to the afternoon of the 13th and summon the shareholders to court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Wet Nurse Visiting Master's Illness Causes a Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Inaccurate and Incomplete Content</p>
<p>Gu Yushan, a local resident of Haichao Road in the South City, is sixty years old and wealthy. His wife, Gu Xia, is also sixty-two years old. Thirty years ago, after giving birth to a child, they hired a wet nurse named Pan from Tongzhou (now fifty-two years old). At that time, Pan was in her prime, possessing the beauty of a young woman, and was favored by the master. Subsequently, she resided at No. 3, Lane 74, Xiaoputuo Bridge in the South City, and bore him a son and a daughter. Recently, Gu Yushan suffered from an abdominal tumor and was hospitalized for surgery. Pan, concerned, brought qiazi (a type of fruit), fruits, and snacks to the Gu residence to visit him. Gu Xia saw her and became extremely jealous, refusing her entry, leading to an argument. Pan became enraged and threw stone bricks, completely smashing bowls, dishes, and stools. The police were called, and each had their own reasons, leading to a lawsuit in court. Xia then engaged lawyer Xu Xingti in the local court, suing for obstruction of freedom and property damage, denying any relationship with her husband, and claiming to be seeking twenty years of back wages as a wet nurse. Yesterday, Judge Shao opened the court. Pan presented her version of events, stating that there was only a verbal argument and no damage to property. The judge decided to postpone the hearing for further investigation, requiring Gu Baoyou to testify in person.</p>

<h3>Japanese Drug Den Cracked Down on in Hainan Road</h3>
<p>Eight Chinese Sitting Around Smoking Heroin; All Arrested and Sent to Hospital for Interrogation</p>
<p>Western Detective Vewu and Chinese Detective Guo Ruiquan of the Hongkou Police Station learned that a house at No. 53 Hainan Road was selling heroin and providing opium substitutes for profit. They sent an informant to purchase drugs and confirmed the information. However, the house was leased by a Japanese named Suzuki Jihei. At approximately 11 AM the day before yesterday, they coordinated with Japanese detectives from the Japanese Consulate and Chinese and Western police officers to raid the location. They found eight local residents, including Zhang Shangxian, Jiang Taisou from Zhenjiang, Jiang Taifu, Ma Xiaosanzi from Taizhou, Shen Zhongwu, Shen Genfu, Wang Laohu, and an elderly woman, Hua Laosan from Wuxi, sitting around a table smoking heroin. A servant, Wu Azhang, tore open two small packages of drugs and threw the paper on the ground. Zhang Shangxian and others were arrested. The main suspect, Japanese Suzuki Jihei, along with a total of 85 small packages of heroin, two small opium pipes, two small bamboo tubes, four cigarette lighter shells, two cigarette foil papers, and two candles, were taken to the police station. Suzuki Jihei was sent to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. The nine men and women, including Zhang Yanxian, were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. The lawyer of the Public Works Department, Zhang Dayin, explained the case and requested public prosecution under Articles 8 and 16 of the Anti-Drug Law. He stated that, except for the defendant Wu Azhang, the others had confessed to smoking drugs at the police station. If any of the defendants changed their statements in court, he requested a postponement for a forensic examination by the court's medical examiner. Chinese and Western detectives then presented the evidence and described the process of solving the case. Zhang Shangxian, Jiang Taifu, Ma Xiaosanzi, and Shen Zhongwu all claimed to have been smoking for medical reasons, at a cost of twenty copper coins per small package. The others denied the charges, claiming to have been visiting friends. (It was discovered that Tu Laohu had been arrested for smoking heroin last May and sentenced to three years of imprisonment. He was later sent to a drug rehabilitation hospital and released.) Judge Zhong Qing ordered the defendants to be detained separately for further verification in seven days. Jiang Taisou, Shen Genfu, Wang Laohu, Wu Azhang, and the elderly woman Hua Laosan were sent to the court's forensic department for examination.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: The letter published in your newspaper on the 8th, regarding the correction of "Iwo Line Deck Workers Oppose the Establishment of a Management Affairs Office," is inconsistent with the facts and is intended to shirk responsibility. We hereby provide a detailed account of the actual process and reasons, and request that it be published to correct the record. Sincerely, the Hoi An East Sea Boat Deck Workers of the Iwo Line. ㊀ The Law on the Organization of Seamen's Unions stipulates that the five departments of seamen refer to workers. Therefore, the organization of groups should also be based on workers as the basic unit. Now that the managers are organizing the Managers' Mutual Aid Society, the workers are afraid of being further oppressed and harmed in the future. Therefore, they petitioned the Seamen's Party Department and the union to prevent its establishment, which is fully in line with the Law on the Organization of Seamen's Unions. What is considered unreasonable? ㊁ The so-called "Managers' Mutual Aid Society invites Mr. Wang Xiaolai and Mr. Li Zubi to be the chairman and vice-chairman" is a selfish plot by a few active members among the managers, who used flowery words to deceptively invite Mr. Wang and Mr. Li to serve as chairman and vice-chairman without the consent of the workers. It is naturally a private group of managers. Now, the 100+ workers of the Hoi An Line, because they already have a group, the "Dong Yi Society," which is formally established and has achieved results, and the workers have benefited significantly. Therefore, they appointed representatives to petition the Seamen's Party Department and the union to stop issuing a license, as the Party Department and the union should handle the workers' movement, and should not issue a license according to the wishes of the workers. ㊂ Some boat managers are against the workers. For example, the manager of the new "Ping Wo" boat, Ma Yuting, unjustly fired worker Jiang Yongyao on the 6th of this month and hired a private seaman to supplement the work. Another example is the manager of the "Fu Sheng" boat, Yang Xianquan, who deducted worker Chen Qiusheng's salary by four yuan (the company stipulates a monthly salary of 18 yuan, but the manager deducted four yuan, only giving 14 yuan per month). There are countless such cases among the managers of the Hoi An boats, all of which can be investigated one by one. Is this not a fact? January 8, 1937.</p>
<p>To the Editor: After reviewing the report in your newspaper on the 7th of this month regarding the case of Ms. Lu Chen suing Zhou Yu and Lu Zhou Weizhen for assault, which was represented by our firm (i.e., the news report on the dispute between mother-in-law and daughter-in-law and the involvement of both families), the content is inconsistent with the facts. We request that the following points be corrected: ㊀ During the court hearing that day, the defendant Zhou Weizhen did not say anything about thin or thick porridge. ㊁ The defendant Zhou Weizhen's return to her mother's house was of her own volition and was not sent back by our client and her son, De Sun. ㊂ At the end of last year, our client, Lu De Sun, filed a petition with the Second Special District Court to request mediation and to cohabitate with his wife, Weizhen, because his wife Weizhen had been living in her mother's house for a long time. Zhou Weizhen never filed a petition with the Second Special District Court to request separation. ㊃ Lu Chen was beaten by Zhou Yu's son on June 26th of last year, not on December 28th of last year as reported in the newspaper. ㊄ Both parties arrived at court on time for the mediation hearing. The mediation failed because Zhou Weizhen did not intend to cohabitate, not because "the other party did not arrive and the mediation failed" as reported in the newspaper. We hereby submit this letter for clarification and request that your newspaper grant a correction. Sincerely, Attorney Hu Yushi, January 8, 1937.</p>

<h3>A Study of Article 15 of the Income Tax Implementation Regulations</h3>
<p>— Accountant Shen Liren</p>
<p>From the dawn of our nation's history until midnight on December 31, 1936, was a period without income tax (excluding partial levies and income donations, etc.). Starting from New Year's Day, 1937, various income taxes were fully implemented, marking a major reform in our nation's finances and economy. As this new tax is being implemented, people across the country are deeply concerned about its regulations, studying its implementation guidelines. Currently, there are two laws in our country regarding income tax: one is the Provisional Income Tax Law, comprising twenty-six articles, and the other is the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Income Tax Law, totaling forty-nine articles. The former is the fundamental law of income tax, providing a comprehensive overview, while the latter elaborates on its clauses, supplementing the shortcomings of the Implementation Regulations. The method of collection is described in detail in the Implementation Regulations. Although the collection of income tax is broadly divided into three categories: profit income, salary and remuneration income, and interest income, among the three, whether viewed from a numerical or economic perspective, the income of profit-making enterprises is the most extensive and complex, requiring the most research. Looking at the entire Income Tax Implementation Regulations, Article 15 is the most important regarding the income of profit-making enterprises. I would like to discuss the content of this article with fellow practitioners.</p>
<p>The original text of Article 15 is: "When calculating Category 1 income, the gross income should be reduced by the actual expenses incurred during the business period, bad debts, depreciation, inventory consumption, public levies, and legally stipulated reserve funds. The remaining amount is the net profit, which is taxed according to the tax rate stipulated in Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations." The word "actual" in this article is quite questionable. The common interpretation of "actual" is "real," but among the items listed in this article that should be deducted, besides expenses, public levies, and legally stipulated reserve funds, most of the other items are based on estimation. Even the item of expenses sometimes cannot obtain the actual amount. I will discuss each item in detail below.</p>
<p>㊀ Expenses: There are two types of calculation for expenses: the accrual basis (or the rights and responsibilities basis) and the cash basis (or the cash receipts and payments basis). Each industry can weigh the situation and decide for itself. The Company Law does not have any regulations. However, once one method is adopted, it cannot be changed arbitrarily. Because after deciding to adopt a certain system, if it is continuously applied, although there may be a sudden increase or decrease in the tax payable in the first year, it can still be compensated in the following years, and the final result will be the same. From an accounting theory perspective, the accrual basis is more reasonable for large-scale businesses. Now this article stipulates that the expenses must be "actual," which seems to mean the expenses actually paid. Those that have not been paid but have been consumed cannot be included.</p>
<p>㊁ Bad Debts: The so-called bad debts are not actually uncollectible debts. Generally, at the end of the accounting year, based on the collection situation, an estimated amount for "bad debt provision" is made. If interpreted literally as "actual bad debts," it must refer to debts that are truly uncollectible before they can be deducted from the gross income.</p>
<p>㊂ Depreciation: The meaning of depreciation has both theoretical and practical aspects. Actual depreciation can be illustrated by two examples. Suppose a car is purchased for six thousand yuan. After one year, if the car is sold for three thousand yuan, and after two years it can be sold for two thousand yuan, then the actual depreciation in the first year is three thousand yuan, and in the second year it is one thousand yuan. This is one example. Another example is that a roadside telephone pole can usually be used for ten years. Its function is the same from the first year to the ninth year. It is only in the last year that it is damaged and unusable. The actual depreciation must only occur in the tenth year, and there is no need for depreciation in the previous nine years. The calculation of depreciation in accounting is theoretical.</p>
<p>㊃ Inventory Consumption: The consumption of goods during inventory is the result of valuation, and there is no fixed standard. It cannot be called "actual." Since the promulgation of the Detailed Rules for Implementation, our office has often received inquiries regarding the ambiguities of this article. Now, I have selected a few of the more important questions and their answers, which are appended below.</p>
<p>㊀ Question: If a customer's debt has been written off as a bad debt but is suddenly recovered in the following year, how should this recovered amount be calculated to comply with the provisions of the Income Tax Regulations?</p>
<p>Answer: The so-called "compliance with the provisions of the Income Tax Regulations" in your question is not actually specified in the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Income Tax Law. However, based on the principles, if a bad debt that has been written off is recovered in the second year, it should be treated as a profit for the second year. Because it was written off in the first year, the profit must have decreased as a result, and the tax was also lower. After it is recovered in the second year, it should be included in the profit and re-paid for the tax that should be borne. However, this point is also related to the date of the implementation of income tax. If the bad debt was written off before the implementation of income tax, but was suddenly recovered after the implementation of income tax, this recovered amount should not be treated as a profit for the year it was received, because the law does not apply retroactively. Since the recovered amount belongs to before the implementation of income tax, it should not be taxed.</p>
<p>㊁ Question: Our small business has no provisions for depreciation. In the past, because business was booming, our owner wrote off a large amount of depreciation on various fixed assets. Now that we hear that income tax will be implemented soon, can we add the excessively amortized depreciation back into the assets?</p>
<p>Answer: This situation is common among businesses in our country that are thriving. However, after the implementation of income tax, profits will inevitably increase after large depreciations have been made in the past, and the tax will be high. Therefore, to reduce the burden of taxation, the over-provisioned depreciation should be transferred to assets to make a reasonable correction.</p>
<p>㊂ Question: In the past, our company intentionally underestimated the valuation of inventory in order to conceal profits, and there was a large difference between the valuation and the cost price. Is there any conflict between this valuation method and the collection of income tax?</p>
<p>Answer: The Provisional Income Tax Law and the Detailed Rules for Implementation do not specify the method of inventory valuation. Each industry has its own characteristics and can determine a standard based on the circumstances. However, once it is stipulated, it cannot be changed arbitrarily. If you want to change it, you must report it to the income tax authorities and explain the reasons.</p>
<p>(If any sectors have questions about various aspects of income tax in our country, they can write to the China Certified Public Accountants Office at 275 Gordon Road, Shanghai. We will answer them in detail to the best of our knowledge.)</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>"The Suiyuan Front is Extremely Peaceful"</h3>
<p>— Yunhai</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper on the 6th, I was shocked to see "The Suiyuan Front is Extremely Peaceful." The enemy has been plotting against us and their desires cannot be satisfied with the surrender of even an inch of land. Now, the front suddenly reports "peace." Could it be that "Ning Weng gets his horse," a precursor to disaster? Several years ago, I read Remarque's "All Quiet on the Western Front," and at the end, the Western Front officers reported "all quiet," but who knew that the soldiers on the front lines were dying from enemy bullets? The book emphasizes the cruelty of "war," but I heard a silent cry - we must not be optimistic about the superficial "peace," because the reality is still dangerous. If this statement has any truth, it is applicable now.</p>
<p>Under the headline "The Suiyuan Front is Peaceful" on the 6th, we see: "Enemy planes have not flown in the past four days, from the 2nd to the 5th. The situation in Honggeertu, Tumutai, and other places is unusually peaceful." Perhaps the soldiers fighting in the frozen, snowy fields have been too exhausted from the fierce battles of the past few days, so the enemy planes not attacking us is considered "peaceful" and allows them to rest a little. This is understandable, but the fear is that those of us in the rear will not observe the actual situation and will be satisfied with this comfortable state of "peace," and will excitedly set off firecrackers to celebrate victory, which would be falling for the enemy's trap.</p>
<p>Originally, in order to "eradicate" the scourge of war, we cannot be satisfied with "enemy planes have not flown in the past four days." Even if we take a step back and only think about "defense," we should consider the reason why the enemy planes are not coming - is it a cessation of aggression? Or is it a mobilization and replenishment of troops, preparing for a large-scale invasion after recuperating?</p>
<p>Regarding the right and wrong of these two questions, let us let the facts of these four days from "enemy planes have not flown in the past four days from the 2nd to the 5th" answer them.</p>
<p>Report from the 2nd: Wang Ying gathered the remnants of bandits and reorganized them into an army. The 3rd Brigade and a heavy artillery battalion are stationed in Shangdu Tunken Village. In addition, Li Shouxin's 6th Regiment, Bao Yueqing's 13th, 14th, and 15th Regiments, and the Yeshan Artillery 2nd Regiment are all gathered in Shangdu. Report from the 3rd: More than 2,000 troops of the puppet army Wang Jingxiu's command were dispatched from Duolun to Shangdu. Zhang Yizhe's (Zhang Haipeng's son) cavalry of more than 1,000 are harassing the people near Shangdu, with no discipline. Report from the 4th: The Kwantung Army's major regiment moved into Zhangbei County, and transported 100 tanks. The puppet army Yu Zhiyue's command of about 1,000 people today (4th) was dispatched from Duolun to Shangdu. The puppet army is currently building trench ladders, the airport is parked with 20 enemy planes and more than 30 armored vehicles, the deployment is tense, and they plan to attack the east of Suiyuan from Honggeertu and Tumutai. Report from the 5th: Zhangbei Shangdu has become an important base for a certain party to harass Suiyuan. Recently, a large amount of military supplies were transported from the hot area to Jiabu Temple, twice as much as before the failure, and distributed to various bandit departments in the front defense. Wang Ying and Li Shouxin were both recalled to Huade.</p>
<p>At the front lines, the enemy's mobilization and replenishment have fully demonstrated that "peace" is superficial. Moreover, in the New Year, the "friendly nation" also gave us two "precious gifts" (one is sending warships to the inland of the Yangtze River near Changshu and Taicang to survey the water level and shoot at the shore with heavy machine guns. The other is sending planes on the morning of the 2nd to fly over Qingdao's airspace to scatter five-colored flags and leaflets). These are also "conscious" actions!</p>
<p>This year is the "Year of the Ox." We should learn the ox's brute force spirit to eradicate the banditry, and we should not learn from the "Year of the Rat" to be timid and satisfied with the "superficial peace."</p>
<h3>The Peak</h3>
<p>— Yulu</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the harbor, the first thing we saw was the very majestic "Peak," the backdrop of this southern port.</p>
<p>Most ships arrive at night, so the Peak makes an even more profound impression on the average traveler. A dark, towering shadow stands like a barrier before our eyes. If that huge shadow is like a demon, then it must be wearing a long robe shimmering with phosphorescence, with countless lights twinkling around the mountain, looking strangely lovely.</p>
<p>If it were daytime, then you could see this natural stronghold more clearly, with an aesthetic eye.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is a mountain island. Yes, it is indeed formed of mountains, and the Peak is the mother of Hong Kong. The metropolis of the British Empire's Pacific territory, famous throughout the world, is built at the foot of this mountain. Its terrain gives Hong Kong its very crucial position.</p>
<p>At the top of the mountain, as we saw in the daytime, flies the "Union Jack," boasting of ownership. The shadow sways in the wind, which is indeed a great comfort to those greedy rulers. The mountain is also very beautiful, and the villa-style houses built on the mountainside are like adding makeup to a beautiful young woman, adding a lot of charm; however, it is also because this majestic mountain compresses the houses on the hillside into a small peak. - People who are used to living in Hong Kong do not mention it much.</p>
<p>Of course, all artificial decorations are "intentional." A woman dresses up beautifully for her own reasons; the reason why the Peak is like this is not to intoxicate some holiday travelers from Europe? Every summer, these villa-style houses have their own customers, but there is a condition here, or rather a "harsh example," which is "no transactions with yellow-skinned Chinamen." This is a privilege given by God to the white rulers! (However, there are "exceptions" here. It is said that Comprador He X, who is almost naturalized, is "permitted" to build a house on the hillside.) I wonder if this "harsh example" or this "privilege" has been abolished now?</p>
<p>In addition to villas, there is also the "Peak Hotel" to entertain short-term travelers. Its nobility is just like its price, which is unimaginable for us common people. This, like the "Peninsula Hotel" located in Tsim Sha Tsui, is one of the most famous noble hotels in Hong Kong. Of course, these are just "gifts" for wealthy gentlemen from the mainland.</p>
<p>We should not think that the mountain is high and the transportation is inconvenient, which is undoubtedly a "杞憂 (groundless worry)." The transportation here is a very smooth and wide asphalt road for the convenience of those "who have cars." In addition, there is also the very famous "Peak Tram" for sightseeing. This kind of car is commonly called "Peak Train" by Hong Kong people, but it is not like a regular train, only the form and appearance are similar. This kind of car is connected by a very strong cable, and it goes up the mountain at an angle of thirty or forty degrees. It runs very slowly, which is very suitable for enjoying the mountain scenery.</p>
<p>The mountain is artificially transplanted with many European or African tropical plants, and the suitable location of Hong Kong, and the seaside on all sides, so the temperature here is really very suitable, not cold or hot, which is very commendable, no wonder many people often travel here.</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a heavenly world. Everything in the world can be washed away here. It is a pure world. However, of course, this is also very disgusting, just like all the gentlemen's places of enjoyment. This is not only because the artificial "artificiality" has rendered the flesh and blood of countless poor people, (just the installation of the "Peak Tram" alone, it is said that I don't know how many Chinese workers have died.) and squeezed the food of how many people; even from its own point of view, those fat white gentlemen sitting on the sofa, aren't their stomachs often calculating how to eat other people's blood to fatten themselves?</p>
<p>However, some people still say that the city of "mountains" and the city of "water" - Venice - each have their own charm.</p>
<h3>The Ox Cart</h3>
<p>— Lu Ping</p>
<p>The sun has quietly hidden behind a gray cloud, the sky is covered with a thick gloom, the cold wind is howling, the dust and sand are flying, and the entire universe seems to be freezing.</p>
<p>"The climate in the north is indeed different from that in the south..." Thinking of this, I turned a hillside and walked onto the sheep intestine path to Baowang: but from here to Baowang there are still more than twenty miles.</p>
<p>The old ox seemed very tired, and he was slowly advancing along the deserted path. I looked at the sky, and it was getting darker and darker every moment, the wind was howling, and it seemed like it was about to snow. I was anxious, hoping to get to Baowang as soon as possible, but he was just slowly walking, not willing to run fast at all. I desperately whipped him, but it was still useless.</p>
<p>The wheels were rolling on the not-so-flat mountain path, bumping very hard, almost overturning a carload of sorghum. I was very worried that I would fall into the mountain gully with the car and the people.</p>
<p>Today, the old ox was acting strangely, his feet were always sticking like heavy lead, and he couldn't lift them up. Although the whip was constantly waving on his butt, every time he was whipped, he barely ran a few steps, but after running seven or eight steps, he stopped moving forward again. I was really a little angry, was he intentionally messing with me today? So, the heavy whip rained down on his legs and body.</p>
<p>"Cheap beast, cheap beast, cheap beast!" Snap - snap - snap... But, I immediately took back the whip I was whipping him with, and said with pity, "Maybe, maybe he is already sick!"</p>
<p>He was really too hard-working. Spring plowing, autumn harvest, summer weeding, winter transportation, he would not have much time to rest throughout the year, and he would not be fed good food.</p>
<p>The weather was really cold, the wind was almost like a knife on my face, and the fingers on both hands seemed to have been cut off. I pulled down the ears on the felt hat to cover my face, and kissed my fingers on my mouth, still strenuously whipping the old ox on the butt, and mustered my courage to move forward on the winding mountain road.</p>
<p>The bare tree trunks were shaking their heads in the air, a group of bald crows, "ya! ya! ya!" were flying around in the dead forest, as if they couldn't find their old home. I sat anxiously on the ox cart, like a lonely traveling monk, rushing on the lonely long journey, this broken wooden cart and the weak old ox were my only companions.</p>
<p>The black curtain in the high sky gradually unfolded, and everything on the earth was swallowed up by the demon of the night.</p>
<p>"It's night, what can I do?" Thinking that there were at least ten miles to Baowang, my body was cold, my stomach was hungry, and the old ox could no longer walk. I was afraid: although I still had three dried buns that I hadn't eaten in my pocket, I didn't even think about eating them now, the cold sweat on my back was soaking wet, and the goosebumps were standing up one by one. I was thinking to myself, don't let a terrible beast jump out now and devour me.</p>
<p>Clumps of trees moved past me, sometimes startling a turtledove, which flew up with a crash, startling me. A crash flew up, startling me. The nightingale on the soil hill beside me was also "hating! hating!" calling out, and several wolf howls were faintly heard in the distance: I trembled, held my breath, and no matter how tired the old ox was, I desperately added the whip to his butt.</p>
<p>Gradually, I could see some lights, and the barking of the dogs in Baowang could be faintly heard, so I let go of my hanging heart and my courage suddenly grew a lot. I kissed my numb hands and wiped the cold sweat from my forehead with my cuffs.</p>
<p>"Here we are, you can rest for a while, hurry up, we'll be there in a moment." I gently patted the old ox on the back with the whip, as if comforting him, and said to him like coaxing a child.</p>
<h3>Sleepless Night</h3>
<p>— Liu Wang</p>
<p>Perhaps it's because I haven't been in a good mood lately, but when I get into bed, a lot of thoughts, I don't know where they come from, thousands of them, surround me like ropes, making me unable to fall asleep immediately. After a fairly long time, after those thoughts have confused my brain, I will vaguely fall into a dream.</p>
<p>But, I don't know when, I will wake up for no reason. I think the time since I really fell asleep won't be long, right? At this time, the night is already very deep, but there is no way to determine what time it is, although the clock is ticking non-stop. Its even sound echoes the beating of my heart, making my heart feel extraordinarily empty and extraordinarily heavy.</p>
<p>I turned over, and the small iron bed made a creaking sound, but I still didn't sleep comfortably. I barely closed my eyes, as if I was under some kind of pressure, and soon they opened again like springs. Looking at the dark room, a sense of emptiness deeply attacked me. Sleeping alone in this room, I also felt even smaller.</p>
<p>The light from the street lamp penetrates through the glass window and shines on the wall, drawing a faint line. It seems so powerless and so desolate. And the jagged bare branches of the French parasol tree in front of the window constantly caress the wall with its shadow, like the small hands of many demons, casting a hypnosis, waiting for people to quietly fall asleep, to seize your soul.</p>
<p>It is very quiet outside, except for the whistling of the night wind, and the rustling sound of it shaking the branches and falling a few leaves, I can't hear anything else. It's as scary as being in a desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>Therefore, I really thought of the lives of people in primitive societies, and the lives of those savage ethnic groups in the deep mountains of Africa and southwestern China; and from this scene, I thought of what the state should be in the quiet night in my hometown at this time; until many chaotic thoughts led me to the edge of the dreamland, suddenly a burst of sound outside woke me up.</p>
<p>"Hu—" Like a whirlwind, a car sped past the asphalt road in front of the window. Although it was such a light and clear sound, it temporarily broke the night silence of the city, like a bright meteor that flashed across the dark blue sky of summer night.</p>
<p>Maybe this car is carrying those young masters, just returning tired from dancing in the dance hall, I thought. Otherwise, what important matter would there be at this time to drive outside in a car? Surely, it belongs to a night enjoyer with blurry eyes; maybe, next to him, there is a beautiful geisha leaning, showing off her seductive charm!</p>
<p>And soon, in the distance, the factory siren sounded a return sound. Those different tunes are competing for who can bark loudly, with intonation, excitedly, like the mad howling of hungry wolves in the deep mountains. From the factory gate - the gate as big as the bloody mouth of a wolf, many crowds who have been squeezed dry of their flesh and blood will begin to be spit out; at the same time, a new team will pour in like waves to fill the empty seat. Thinking of this, I felt an unbearable shudder, and unstoppable anger and injustice.</p>
<p>I long for the sky to brighten up soon.</p>

<p>The first part, "Two Mao Money", is a symphony of urban life, seeing the various aspects of society from a small banknote.</p>
<p>The second part, "Spring Boudoir Broken Dream", is a nightmare that contains mystery, tension, and terror, with the soul of a conscripted soldier, the blood of a heroic woman, and the dance of a mad demon, which is wonderfully vivid, thrilling and shocking.</p>
<p>In the third part, "Stranger", there is the storm of the times, the fire of the nation, the clash of money and blades, and the exchange of hot tears and red blood.</p>
<p>The fourth part, "Three People", is a concise and humorous tragicomedy, a comedic program in the Lianhua Symphony, starring Lianhua's three treasures, Han Langen, Liu Jiqun, and Yin Xiucen.</p>
<p>The fifth part, "Moonlit Night Sketch", is like a lyrical poem, writing about the sorrow of homesickness, full of sentimentality, resentment, and tragedy, and in just over ten minutes, it can grab your emotions from beginning to end without letting go.</p>
<p>The sixth part, "Ghost", is a scientific drama that breaks superstitions, exploring the question of whether to fear ghosts? Banish ghosts? Or kill ghosts?</p>
<p>The seventh part, "Madman's Rhapsody", in which the madman is definitely not a madman!</p>
<p>The eighth part, "Little Five Heroes", is a precious cartoon, with humorous satire, extremely pungent, and like an eruption of a volcano, it can turn the world upside down and startle the gods.</p>
