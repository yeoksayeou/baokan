<h3>汪精衛講最後關頭之意義</h3>
<p>未至的時候要忍耐　已至的時候要犧牲　必使人地俱成灰燼　不留一個傀儡種子</p>
<p>［南京］汪主席日前曾作一重要演說、題為“最後關頭”、茲探錄原詞如下、</p>
<p>各位同志、本月十五日兄弟曾對各位同志說了幾句關於救亡國存的話、如今所要說的是、就從前說過的幾句話、加以引申、本月十五日、蘆溝橋事件已經發生好幾日了、當時兄弟曾說、這事件之演進如何、雖未能預測、然這事件决不是偶然發生、而是一種預定計劃、那麼我們也只有據着已定方針、以為應付、及至十七日蔣委員長第一期談話會裏已經鄭重的把方針宣布出來了、全國報紙都已登載、各位同志都已看見、這裏頭有一句最明確最緊要的話、是說中國今日已到了最後關頭、兄弟如今想就“最後關頭”四字加以說明、我們記得在二十四年十一月五全大會裏、蔣委員長曾經說過、“和平未至完全絕望、决不輕棄和平、犧牲未至最後關頭、决不輕言犧牲、”這幾句說話、在二中全會裏曾經有明切的解釋、三中全會對於外交方針、也是根據着這幾句說話、以為進行、我們知道日本對於中國是侵略無已的、自九一八以來、對於中國是一步一步的殺進來、而中國呢、却是一步一步的往後退、中國為什麼一步一步的往後退呢、因為中國比較日本進步遲了六七十年、中國的國家力量、不能擋住日本的侵略、然則自從九一八以來、中國外交內政的方針、是怎樣呢、總括說來、在外交上不能擋住日本一步一步的殺進來、只能想些方法使他進得慢些、中國不能不一步一步的往後退、只能想些方法、使我們退得慢些、為什麼想慢些呢、難道想趁此偷安茍活麼、不然、我們只想趁着這慢些、騰出一些時間來、在內政上做種種凖備的工作、以加强我們的抵抗力、這便是九一八以來中國外交內政的方針、自從九一八以來、中國以九一八事件訴諸國聯、原想藉國聯的道德制裁·經濟制裁·武力制裁、使日本不能向中國一步一步的殺進來、然在事實上國聯除了有些微道德制裁之外、經濟制裁武力制裁絲毫休想、因此日本的殺進來一步一步沒有停止、東三省遂次第淪陷了、我們在這時候只能做得一些號召全國精誠團結共赴國難的工作、然這些工作、只是起頭還沒有什麼成就、於是日本一步一步的殺進來的結果、由九一八事件而進為一二八事件了、以十九路軍第五軍及各處援軍之苦戰、及國聯調查團之幹旋、三月初淞滬失守、因而有淞滬停戰協定之締結、淞滬停戰協定、自然是重大的損失、而當時所以締結這協定、是想使日本進得慢些、我們退得慢些、趁着這慢些趕快做種種凖備的工作、例如江西剿匪之得以進行、東南各省公路網之得以完成、這是否得不償失呢、留待公論、淞滬停戰協定之後、不過一年、而熱河戰事、長城各口戰事、又發生了、日本之殺進來一步一步的緊了、及至我軍敗績、熱河失守、長城各口亦以次失守、於是又有塘沾停戰協定、這自然是更重大的損失、而當時所以締結這協定、是想使日本進得慢些、我們退得慢些、趁着這慢些、趕快做種種凖備的工作、我們發覺精神方面物質方面、缺憾太多了、抵抗力薄弱而且零碎、不能將整個國家整個民族的抵抗力量完全發勁、而且還有許多從旁從後牽製阻撓我們、因此在精神方面謀團結講組織之、改善、謀訓練之加緊、在物質方面、則國防設備與國民經濟建設同時並進、兩三年間、精神方面有些成就、物質方面的成就也有數目字可以計算、統一事業、不能說是完成、而不能說沒有進步、至於勦匪、則東南數省、次第肅清了、這是否得不償失呢、留待公論、塘沾停戰協定之後、繼續發生的是通車問題、通郵問題、我們在不承認偽國原則之下、通車以不用偽國車票、通郵以不用偽國郵票、而勉强解决、至於通航等等問題、仍在繼續堅持、而二十四年六月日本之殺進來又一步一步的緊了、從五月二十五日起、口頭交涉至六月九日、我們鑒於形勢不能不作種種緊急處分、因為至六月十二日、便是日本自由行動的時候了、這種種緊急處分、其為重大損失、確是忍無可忍、讓無可讓、而仍然忍下去讓下去、當時所以如此、是想使日本進得慢些、我們退得慢些、因此之故、各種凖備的工作、仍得進行、精神方面物質方面、僅可能的努力去做、其間如西南勦匪之完成、兩廣之統一等等、這是否得不償失呢、留待公論、這樣的忍了又忍、讓了又讓、已經整整的六年了、我們不能不想着這樣的一步一步的殺進來、是無底此的、這樣的一步一步的往後退、是無底止的、而且我們的凖備、我們知道、日本也知道、我們固然得坦白的說、“這些凖備、都是現代國家所必需、我們恃此以與人為敵、我們亦恃此以與人為友、為敵為友、不只在我、而且在人、”然而日本會這樣的說、“我們不只不許你們與我為敵、而且不許你們與我為友、”那麼我們之華備、不但不能得到慢些的結果、反而是喚我日本之加緊的一步一步殺進來了、這樣的不凖備不可、欲凖備不能、使我們於想些方法一步一步的往後退的時候、不能不劃定一個最後關頭、未到這最後關頭、容許我們想些方法、能不退最好、不能不退、也盡可能的退得慢些、及至到了這最後關頭、則我們一齊站着、不能往後再退一步了、從前說過、和平未至完全絕望决不放棄和平、犧牲未到最後關頭、决不輕言犧牲、當“未至”的時候、我們要有絕大的决心與勇氣來忍耐、及已“至”的時候、我們要有絕大的决心與勇氣來犧牲、我們當日若不忍耐而孟浪犧牲、則犧牲為無意義、今日若不犧牲而猶言凖備、則凖備為尤無意義、犧牲兩個字、是嚴酷的、我們自己犧牲、我們並且要全國同胞一齊犧牲、因為我們是弱國、我們是弱國之民、我們所謂抵抗、無他內容、其內容只是犧牲、我們要使每一個人、每一塊地、都成為灰燼、不使敵人有一些得到手裏、這意義誠然是嚴酷的、然不如此、則尚有更嚴酷的隨在後頭、質面言之、我們如不犧牲、那就只有傀儡了、中國歷史上為外族所侵略、半亡者數次、全亡者兩次、這些亡不是侵略者能將我們四萬萬人殺盡、能將我們四百餘萬方里毀盡、而是我們死了幾個有血性的人之後、大多數沒血性的人、將自家的身體、連同所有的土地、都進貢給侵略者、以為富貴之地、侵略者因此極寫意的便將我們大多數的人、以及全數的土地得到手裏、我們今日是不是仍然要做做傀儡呢、不做傀儡只有犧牲、我們是弱國、我們是弱國國民、說到打倒別人或者不能做到、說到犧牲自己、那就無論怎樣弱法、也沒有不能做到之理、如其不能做到、是不為、不是不能、所謂不為、便是沒有犧牲之决心、而只有傀儡之决心了、我們不但因為不願做傀儡而犧牲了自己、我們並且因為不願自己犧牲之後、看見自己的同胞去做傀儡、所以我們必定要强制我們的同胞、一齊的犧牲、不留一個傀儡的種子、無論是通都大鎮、無論是荒村僻壤、必使人與地俱成灰儘、我們雖不能擋住敵人之殺進來、然而我們必能使敵人殺進來之後、一無所得、我們幾年以來、處心積慮、講統一、講組織、講訓練、為的是到最後關頭、能夠發動整個國家整個民族之精神的力量、以駕馭使用日積月累得來的各種物質建設、加强對於侵略之抵抗、所謂抵抗、便是能使整個國家整個民族為抵抗侵略而犧牲、天下旣無弱者、天下卽無强者、那麼我們犧牲完了、我們抵抗之目的也達到了、我們高呼一句最後關頭、我們更高呼一句犧牲、（三十一日中央社電）</p>

<h3>日軍轟炸天津已使舉世骇然</h3>
<p>英報痛論國際道德低落　美總統不休假注意大局</p>
<p>［伦敦］關於日軍轰炸天津事、此處新聞紀事報載一社論、谓此事已使舉世骇然、但尚未極深切、該報稱、“日本定可逃避其結果、蓋此巨大城市之被炸、在此後更巨大侵略發生之後、亦不過尋常事件耳、而國際間道德低落、至何程度、卽可由世界對於日軍轟炸天津、漠然無動於衷、得一無可更强之證例、往者如西班牙古都古爾尼卡、近者如西班牙京城馬德里、目前為中國之天津、或將來倫敦被敵人轟炸後、世界亦視若無覩、則感其痛苦者、亦僅倫敦人而已、（中央社三十一日路透電）</p>

<p>［莫斯科］共產黨機關報眞理報頃載一文、略稱、中國軍隊防衛力量、日益增强，該国十九路軍前於一九三二年在上海戰事中、業已證明、中国軍隊旣属精锐、所置器械、亦颇优良、降至去年綏遠戰事之結果、足使中國軍隊增强自信力、最近北平市附近中國軍隊與日本正規軍交戰之結果、亦足以證明華軍之眞正價值、則以日軍不但器械較優、且員額較多也、此次中日兩國一旦開戰之後、日本方面不但需要大量人力、卽財政上負擔亦極浩大、戰爭若果曠日持久、日軍士氣、自必日益衰頹、總之、日本軍閥現方以火為戲、此在該國頭腦淸醒之資產階級、固亦深知其危險云、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］“斯丹巴”報頃評論遠東局勢、認為遠東事變、尤其是日本軍隊開抵北平一事、實具有極重要之意義、“日本向外擴展政策猶如水面油漬、日益擴大、要可斷言、而國際方面、卽欲以拒絕、恐亦勢所難能、則以外交的武器、現已不復有何效力故”也、（中央社三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>苟存的心理</h3>
<p>— 陶希聖</p>
<p>今日最有利於敵國的，是中國人自己分裂。今日敵國最兇狠的政策，是在泰山壓頂的形勢之下，促成中國之自己分裂。且看他一面向中國領土之內進兵，一面又申明不擴大事態，不斷的講和。這正是對中國人說：“你如不敢打仗，這裏有的是活路。”中國人如果眞走上他留下的活路，結果只有分裂，而分裂的結果是滅亡。</p>
<p>顯明的滅亡之路，是喪權辱國的條約。這雖是敵國所要取得的，但是從任何中國人取得這種條約，是不容易的。如果中國人不打敗仗，便不答應他的條約，他所得到的也就不多。敵國看清楚這一點，他除了以武力取得這種條約以外，更進一步，以一面高壓，一面留下活路的方法，把中國人對外一致的心理給解散了，把中國人對外一致的步驟，給紊亂了。他的成功，比顯明的條約一定可以更大更多。</p>
<p>在他留下的條條活路上面，有兩種的人就會走上去。第一種人是自以為背叛了國家和政府就可以存在，因此積極的背叛國家和政府而依附於敵國。在形式上，敵國並沒有併吞這一塊國士，只不過，背叛了中華民國，甚至於還可以保留中華民國的徽號。這種人以為這樣做是有利於私圖，又可以維持一個獨立存在，又可以不受併吞，不獨不蹈破滅的危機，且可生存於今世。</p>
<p>第二種人是自以為離開國家和政府才可以存在，因此消極的離開國家和政府而自求生存。這種人又可分為兩大類。</p>
<p>第一類是認為政府的對敵政策太過强硬，不適宜於緩和敵國的侵略，因之脫離政府而與敵國求和解者。這一類人的求存的心理，是可以原諒的。在中國沒有實力作大戰以前，委曲求全，乍看起來，本是一個辦法。不過，敵國利用我們這種心理，可以取得不少的利益和滅亡我們的凖備條件。</p>
<p>第二類是認為政府的對敵政策太過軟弱，不適宜於救亡圖存，因之不跟隨政府而自尋活路者。這一類人又可分為兩派。</p>
<p>第一派是表裏如一的取强硬政策而不滿意於政府者。這一派知道政府的政策雖不夠强硬，但若因此便採取反抗政府的手段，為了實現强硬政策，自取分裂，則强硬政策尚未實現之前，已經把政府的對敵力量分散了。這一派的人在現在也只有改取支持政府的熊度。</p>
<p>第二派是表面取强硬政策而實際迎合敵國的心理者。他們以高調而反對政府，以此高調為反對政府的辯護，實際上是自取分裂，分散中國對外力量。在敵國眼中，這種辦法是很有利的，不獨容許他們的活動，甚至保育他們的活動。</p>
<p>第一種人是十足的漢奸，是不用說明的了。第二種人之中，第二類的第二派也是漢奸，是不大容易看得出來的。第二種的第一類，主觀上的無限苦衷，終不能得到客觀的效果。第二種的第二類的第一派，如能捨棄主觀的苦悶而在客觀上效力於國家的完整和存在，是值得我們佩服的。總之“覆巢之下無完卵”是一句很能切合中國現狀的話，假如我們想在覆巢之下做一個完卵，無論主觀上怎樣，在客觀上是有自己分裂的危險的。在今日只有大家一致的把定不分裂不茍存的熊度，才有生路。如果以茍存的心理而走上敵國預定的活路，有保全國土的誠意，尚且不免上當，無此誠意而以高調為辯護，其居心就不可問。</p>

<h3>國防綫上（十八）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派派　叔棣</p>
<p>“主張公道團”工作的對象，是太廣泛了。那些內容，在這裏。不能一一詳述。現在，且舉出“協助檢舉漢奸一這一項，作為例子。照他們對於“漢奸”這個名詞的定義，是：“凡是勾結外國人，危害我們國家的人，就是漢奸，俗話呌做賣國賊。”對於協助檢舉這樣漢奸的具體辦法，牠訂出三項：㊀宣傳方面，縣，村團應於當地小學校開學後之十日內，或“公道團”舉行“喚起民衆運動”之時，與當地小學校，聯合舉行“剷除漢奸遊行示威運動，”張貼標語，並高呼“打倒漢奸”等口號。㊁勸告及警告方面，對於有漢奸嫌疑之人，縣村團部應派人向其勸告，或直接予以警告。對於在外地當漢奸的，應由縣，村團部，責成其家族親友，函囑改悔，函由團部代發，不會寫時，則代寫。㊂正式協助檢舉方面，對街村之漢奸，閭，鄰長不檢舉時，團員報告村團部，通知街，村長，副檢舉或處辦之。如七日內仍不處辦或檢舉者，則報由“縣團部”通知該管行政區長，處辦或檢舉之。如仍未處辦或檢舉，則由縣團長與縣長接洽辦理，一面報告總團部核辦。</p>
<p>實際的執行權力，“主張公道團”是沒有的；然而，牠那監督政治，統制社會的大量，却非常之大。任何處的任何民衆團體，總不能和牠相比。所以，有人說，牠實際是山西自黨部撤消以後的，取其權力而代之的團體。</p>
<p>第四，什麼是“好”和“壞”？什麼是“公道”？——這些，原是非常抽象的觀念；要了解“主張公道團”的意義，我們只好從牠產生約背景，牠的組織，牠的使命和任務，以及牠的工作對象上去了解。不過，外邊的人，對於牠，所最易引起不解和懷疑的，却還是這些抽象概念的處所。記者在山西雖竭力訪問搜求，結果，仍是我不出一個具體的結論；不過，有一點我已經可以斷定了，就是：這些，畢竟是形而上的觀念而已；具體內容，是沒有的。</p>
<p>我把搜求到的一些，披露點在這裏。</p>
<p>“主張公道團”的總口號是：“主張公道”；分下來，有兩個口號：一個是“扶助好官好紳好人，”另一個，是“制裁壞官壞神壞人。”山西當局們曾經說過：“主張公道團，是要把好人結成一個團體，制裁壞人。”依他們的意思說起來，足見夠上做“公道團”團員條件的。就是山西當局們所謂的“好人”；相反的，就是“壞人”。那末，做“公道團”團員的條件，是怎樣呢？據他們所訂，大概除年歲限制不能作為品質分別外，就祇有兩條：㊀“能主張公道”，㊁無特定行為之者。（A）會贓舞弊行為，（B）吸食丹料鴉片，（C）曾受刑事處分，（D）忤逆不孝。所謂“能主張公道”，就是能“替社會打不平的意思。”照山西當局們的意思，所謂“社會不平”的事，大概有十條。（A）“官吏不主張公道，庇護有勢力的，冤枉沒勢力的。”（B）“官吏貪贓受賄。”（C）“官吏沒有責任心，不熱心為人民辦理興利除弊的事，致社會上的利不能興，弊不能除。”（D）“官吏勾結劣紳土棍，顚倒是非。”（E）“官吏不嚴辦壞人，使好人受害。（F）官吏耍脾氣，使人民受冤。”（G）“大官大紳的家族親友，在地方大不說理，小官小紳的家族親友在地方小不說理，都是欺負人民。”（H）“劣紳，土棍，富豪，種地不納糧，還要違抗攤派。”（I）“大戶欺負小戶。”（J）“壞官，壞紳，藉端濫費縣款，壞村長，副，藉端濫費村款。”不久以前，似乎又新加兩項：（A）“觸犯禁烟，禁毒條例”（B）“宣傳赤化，及附逆作漢奸。”不過，有的意見，以為除上述兩個條件外，還要加兩個條件，（A）“有職業且勤於職業”（B）“不賭博。”</p>
<p>我曾和一位山西方面負責的人，談到過這樣的話：“能按照你們列舉的十二項”“社會不平的事，”而加以打抱不平的，那舉措，是算是“主張公道”了吧？</p>
<p>“社會不平的事很多，並不一定限於列舉的十二項；主要的，我們是應當有顆公道的心，隨時隨地，去判斷事物的平否。”</p>
<p>我又問：“假如有個人，他是有職業而又勤於職業的，能主張公道的，不賭博的，並且，也沒有五個特定行為之一的，那未，這就算是“好人”了麼？”</p>
<p>“大體上可以算是‘好人’了。”他點着頭。“不過，所謂特定行為，也並不限於列舉的五項；主要的是，他應當具着‘好人’的習性。”</p>
<p>於是，問題又落到“公道心”和習性”這兩點上了。我的想借歸納以求得“公道”和“好人”這兩名詞具體內容的企圖，在這裏，又起了搖動。</p>
<p>不久，我就離開了山西，所得的，僅僅是這麼樣。</p>

<p>字林報云、天津之大局、似已使之處於控制之下矣、但喪失生命甚衆、損毀財產至巨、日政府似不致因其代表之作為而有特殊之感動、最近某日本報之評論、似以天津市長張自忠所統之第三十八師突然干涉日本之軍事行動為異、此種驚異、為理所當然、蓋日人向視張自忠為日本官員所承認之代表也、張自忠現已轉至北平、開始組織或恢復服從日方指揮之新治制、張自忠顯未能以其保全祿位所恃之政策薰染其全師將士、易言之、該師這一部分不忘彼等為中國軍人、負有保衛國家、抵抗侵略之責任是也、通縣之隊伍、以此種精神拒絕日本軍官繳械之請求、而受日飛機之轟擊、致陷於軍械有無不足為重之地位、但其代表中國主權、永遠抵抗之勇績、已留於靑史矣、第三十八師其他隊伍、亦不承認其領袖所受日本寵惠之利益、而表明一種傾向、其行為一若寧奪日人之地位、而不願與之為伍、彼等已伸其志、而甘受不利、甚至不惜犧牲其生命、但彼等並引起一般人士注意其所抱之思想、大類蔣委員長最近宣言中所表示之情緒、北方之大局、或已在安排中、惟擾亂大局之事變、已產生不全適合日人襲行故技、意中估計以為必有之胃口、日人之侵略、或將覺得已散播戾氣、終必獲人所共知因此行動所將有之結果、東京方面、對於此計算乖誤之錯綜問題、或當以有鋒鋩之言致其駐天津之軍事當局也、</p>
<p>當局態度堅决抗戰</p>
<p>字林報載三十日南京消息云、日軍轟擊天津而尤注重摧毀大中學校、京中中外人士、皆為悲憤、惟就中央政府之大員而論、彼等之態度、似已因日軍最近之暴行而益堅决、星期四夜蔣委員長所發强毅之言論、已可使人深明今後絕少和平談判之希望、中國軍事當局、當然不欲與人詳言其軍事計畫、但訪員所能自滿者、南京現正在積極準備、此間所視為兩國間生死之戰鬥、某要員語訪員曰、一旦戰事開始、無所謂前哨之事務、吾人深知起抗之道、吾人施擊之時、必予以重擊云、</p>

<p>主席致詞</p>
<p>主席潘公展致詞、略謂今天文化界救亡協會、舉行第一次理事會議、適當時局緊張之際、其意義更覺重要、日來一般民衆、對時局或尚未能深切明瞭、致一方面感覺憤慨、同時又似乎流露失望、想文化界諸位先生、對時局觀察、頗為淸楚、决不會有此現象、我們須知此次抗戰、實是中華民族生死的决戰、决非短時間內或者一二次接觸所可終結的、現在抗戰業已開始、一定一天一天的向前推進、這並不一定是指軍隊駐地的推進、而是指抗戰精神和事實的推進、因我國是被人侵略、迫不得已而起來應戰、蔣委員長呈經指示過、絕對不會中途屈服的、諸君看到今天蔣委員長發表的談話、和蔣委員長在庚山談話會中的報告、可見蔣委員長態度之堅决、我們實毫無猶豫之餘地、這兩天一般民衆看到平津突雙的消息即皇皇不可終日、疑慮叢生、議論多端、與前天得到曁豪䣌坊小勝消息後、即欣喜若狂、燃放爆竹、同樣是一種浮躁的心理、虛浮是决不足以應付持久的戰爭的、我們文化界諸先進、一定要負責予以糾正、中央已早下决心、但還有人懷疑中央是否有决心、並問着為什麼不發動全面的抗戰、這固然難怪他們、因為他們根本不懂得戰爭、戰爭是國之大事、是兵家專門的大事、非運籌帷幄的專家、如何能懂得戰爭的一切運籌計劃、大家旣不懂得軍重上的策劃妙用、而對軍事濫發議論、這何止是班門弄斧、須知此次是持久的戰爭、不是局部的戰爭、而且是一個弱國為保衛生命而不得已的對强國的抗戰、不是强國和强國的戰爭說不定有一天、把大牛個中國土地失陷、整半數的同胞或竟慘受犧牲、但並不是退了就不打、敗了就投降、我們要有决心、還是繼續的抗戰、到了最後關頭、不戰也是亡國、戰還可在死路中求一條生路、故戰爭開始、</p>
<p>非戰卽亡</p>
<p>絕無苟安可得、亦無和平可望、中央、旣已下决心、我們對於軍事不能有懷疑、只有絕對的信仰領袖和政府、只要領袖和政府是在領導我們抗戰、領袖和政府要我們做什麼、我們就得不顧一切去犧牲、故目前的問題、是在我們是否能信仰和服從領袖和政府、倘到此危急時機、以不懂軍事的普通民衆、還在懷疑和濫發議論、貽害國家一定不淺、希望文化界諸先生、第一點要領導民衆、絕對信仰領袖和政府、第一從最近一個覆轍可鑒、精神不統一、意志不統一、是不能作戰的、二十九軍之敗、一方面是光榮、一方面又是沉痛、其所以敗、即敗在這一個“精神不統一意志不統一”不治之症、敵人用的是分化政策、天天想使二十九軍與中央分化、再使二十九軍內部分化、於是二十九軍高級幹部、精神不統一、意志不統一、因而行動當然也不能統一、這個想和、那個主戰、舉棋不定、束手待斃、如果意志統一、精神統一、就不會等到人家完全佈置就緒後再來抗戰了、這一點早為蔣委員長意料所及、現在還有人隱約地說、我們要抗戰、但同時我們又要思想自由、那末殷汝耕·江朝宗·齊變元之流、他們要做漢奸、又何嘗不是思想自由、須知在舉國堅决抗戰之下、思想是不能自由的、如果人人要思想自由那末一個將領、還能指揮作戰嗎、所以希望文化界諸先生、要大澈大俉、放棄個人思想自由主議、統一全民族的精神在此情形下、再不大澈大悟、一定種好亡國的禍根、在精神不統一意志不統一之下、二十九軍已有慘烈的犧牲了、平津已斷送了、現在全視我們全國上下、是否能做到民族精神的統一、和意志的統一、即可以斷定國家未來的命運、歐戰時德國最後之失敗、也是為了民族精神的不統一、在魯登道夫將軍所著“全民族戰爭”一書中、說得很詳盡希望文化界人士、要用我們的口、用我們的筆、來喚醒一般民衆、知道民族精神統一和意志統一的寶貴、否則即是無異自殺自亡、第三、我們中國民族復興大業的完成、其過程須學土耳其、西洋人從前說土耳其是近東的病夫、我們是遠東的病夫、但土耳其現在是復興了、土耳其參加歐戰、是戰敗國之一、土耳其的首都君士坦丁、早已淪入敵人的鐵蹄之下、歐戰後、不但首都連全國土地半被人佔領了、但君士坦丁政府簽訂的辱國和約、土耳其靑年國民黨起而反對、他們絕對信仰一個領袖凱末爾將軍、把首都遷往內地安戈拉、曾不數年、統率軍隊反攻、打破了希臘軍、連英法亦不敢動、在第一次洛桑和會中、土耳其派首相依斯麥代表出席、他就提出取消不平等條約、和撤退外國軍隊等基本條件、英國不答應、土國代表即回國再戰、希臘軍大敗、重開和會、英法等國就應了土國的要求、土耳其遂復興而成為一個獨立平等自由的國家、這完全是幾年中堅苦奮鬥</p>
<p>精神統一</p>
<p>所致、中國人民也齊要有這個决心、即使我們的土地和人民犧牲了不知多少、只要尚有一部份土地和人口繼續抗戰、久而不屈、最後勝利、終歸於我們的、如果我們一方面高喊抗戰、一方面打算逃避、或减少犧牲、那無異是旣主戰而又想和勢非亡國投降不可、我們現在要檢閱全國同胞、是否人人有必死之决心、是否人人有統一的信念、如果人人有必死的决心、統一的信念、一定可以勝利的、所以中國要學土耳其一樣持久下去、不投降、不妥協、不氣餒不虛驕、全國一致、絕對信仰蔣委員長為統一抗戰的主帥、始終服從其命令、中國一定能復興的、</p>

<p>“二十九軍百三十二師師長趙登禹，及二千九軍副軍長兼敎導團教育長佟麟閣，忠骸已尋獲，三十日共殮後，靈柩暫厝龍泉寺·據趙之護兵返平談，當戰事激烈，趙師長正在團河左近指揮時，忽中彈，左臂受傷，余卽欲將其背回，師長不允，仍向前進，未幾腿部肩部又受傷，余勸師良後退，師長遂向余云，汝從速返平，向余母言：“忠孝不能兼全，設余不幸，請余母勿悲”云云，余力勸不獲，無奈只得返平，至後門辛寺胡同太夫人寓報告師長母，此後卽不知信息。又聞佟副軍長在前綫時，忽被機槍將腿之下部射傷，佟因正在跑步，向前栽到，適有一砲彈射來，擊中頭部，遂致陣亡。”（三十日中央社電）</p>
<p>“平津情勢，今日如此轉變，早為國人有識者預想所及，”而五千士兵及佟趙兩將軍同殉於難，寗不慘哉！</p>
<p>由於佟趙兩將軍及其他將士的殉國，我們不禁想起岳武穆，趙師長臨難前對護兵說的一從速返平，向余母言：“忠孝不能兼全，設余不幸，請余母勿悲”。便宛然是岳武穆的口吻，際此南宋之局，恍得眼前，我們實在不暇為趙將軍的悲壯之死感動得墮淚，也更且為後死的自身悲也！</p>
<p>岳武穆及其子弟兵不覆滅於金兵而崩滅於內奸之手，至今莫不引為遺恨，而岳武穆之痴忠，於今亦成為識者之遺憾，固然，痴則痴矣，其悲壯之死，其凛然之氣，固尼以驚天地而泣鬼神，亘千古而不朽！</p>
<p>所以，以佟趙兩將軍及其他殉國將士言，固然是死得其所，死而無憾。而於我們後死者，則實在不能忽略當今之漢奸！這不但足為國人之報答佟趙兩將軍，也更且是為了我們以後的岳武穆。</p>
<p>金兵將渡河矣，還沉沉於茍安之迷夢者，速醒諸！</p>
<h3>苦悶之後</h3>
<p>— 馬加</p>
<p>眞的，你一聽到那驟然而來的惡消息：“我軍退出豐台”！日軍反攻廊房才只昨天的極度的歡快，幾小時內，却變化得這樣飛快，飛快得簡直有點神妙莫測，這時候，哪得不使你失掉理智，只憑你一己的感情，如無羈的萬馬般的奔騰，做出各種失掉常態的瘋狂的模樣，哭哪！跺脚哪！有時候竟可恥地想到自殺去吧”！</p>
<p>當時我們四個年青人，看了報紙，的確是陷入於那種瘋狂的狀態中了。我們誰都低掛着頭見，誰都不理睬着誰，這樣足足有了二十分鍾之久，在這二十分鐘裏面，我們全身的血液如火山迸發前的岩漿一樣沸騰着，我捫的眼睛着了火了，我們想把眼前的什麼東西都好，來狠命地向地上一摔。這，小朱是第一個做出來，他在我們的悲憤的沉默中，他把他一只心愛的茶杯向地板上一甩。我們開初是驚了一跳，可是後來大家的視綫集中到那只粉碎了的茶杯那兒去的時候，說來也奇怪，我們都感覺到有種非常快適的感情之流，疾穿過我們鬰寒的心胸。阿黃竟這末咬牙切齒地呌起來</p>
<h3>大便閉結損害健康</h3>

<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>：</p>
<p>“媽的！對付我們的敵人，像這茶杯粉碎一樣，是多乾脆啊！可是！”</p>
<p>阿黄的喉頭哽塞起來了。我没有説出話來，我只是暗忖着“可不是麽？一下子豐台收回了，一下子廊房也克復了，當然，只要再一下子，日本軍隊完全被我們驅逐出華北了，那可是多乾脆的事情啊！可是却徧徧—”我不敢再想下去。</p>
<p>我斜眼去看看老彭，老彭這傢伕比我們冷得多了，他又像平時一樣啦，他的始終没有什麽表情的面孔，現在又是平板板的，像哲學家一樣的，像沉思着一件什麽不可解答的神秘事情一樣的，他的眼睛又是遲鈍地望着前面的牆壁上那張木刻畫，他的腿子抖了抖的。我忍不住他那種寒冷氣，我幾乎是駡他的口吻問他：</p>
<p>“老彭！你究竟是有没有情感的呢？”</p>
<p>老彭只不經意地向我望了一眼，然後，又是像過去一樣地，慢吞吞地説道：</p>
<p>“馬加！説句老實話，我是湖南人，從小我就過着非人的生活，我跑過七八個省份，我嘗味到人世間可説是所有的痛苦了，我何曾没有感情，只是我的感情時常被我的理智所克服過來，而把當前的某一種事象，歡喜深深地想一想罷了！馬加！老實説，我從報販手里拿過報紙，打開一看，我比你們或者更難過百倍呢。我看見你們或者更難過百倍呢。我看見你們發狂一樣的狀態，我的確流出眼淚來了。可是現在，我是心平氣和了。”</p>
<p>小朱跟阿黄都轉過身來，聽着老彭那末沉甸甸地講着。他現在是心平氣和了，我們如何也心平氣和得多了。一看見老彭那副陰森森的態度，再一聽他的沉甸甸的談話，人就會冷了半截子的。老彭望着我們不説什麽，他或許看出我們是在恢復過來了吧，他却像老年人訓戒浮躁的年青人那麽地，又沉甸甸地説了：</p>
<p>“朋友！當值得使你們興奮的時候，你們預好克制一下情感；可是當有使我們悲痛的事實發生時，我們得要請理智先生來給我們細細地想一想。”</p>
<p>他媽的！他不是眞地擺出一副老前輩的面孔在訓戒我們了麽？我轉過頭去看看小朱，阿黄，我看出他們的眼睛裏，都發出一種不屑去理會老彭那話的神情來，我簡直就想對他直嚷去，請他勿再那樣老前輩似地説了吧！可是我畢竟没有直嚷出來，小朱，阿黄呢？也没有説什麽。我只覺得老彭的話相當有道理。老彭大概抓到我們那弱點了吧，他又説了起來：</p>
<p>“朋友！這當然是你們都曉得的，中日間的問題，到今天是已到清算的時期了，可是，這是一段偉大的歷史的進程啊！我們都讀過歷史的，比方就拿英國韋爾斯的世界來説吧，從没有人類的時候起直敘到今日的人類社會止，共只有一千頁左右，我們半個月可以把牠讀完，可是這是經過萬萬千千年的史實啊！中日問題到今天來决算。在史實的記載上或許只是幾頁過去，可是在我們現實中，决不是一天兩天的事啊！”</p>
<p>我們還有什麽話去反駁老彭呢？老彭的神氣雖然是使我們看了有點不舒服，可是他的話却是一點也没有什麽差錯的。我們爲什麽要那末感情用事呢？極度的快樂，直到極度的苦悶。老彭的話是對的，中日問題的决算，在我們的現實中，决不是一天兩天的事！</p>
<p>没一會，我們是都恢復過來了，我們把阿黄踢碎的報紙再檢起來，我們靜靜地再看着報紙。</p>
<p>一小時候後，阿黄説：“關於救護工作，我無論如何要去學習的，難道我們軍事上一點小小的挫折，我就灰心了麽？”</p>
<p>小朱也説，他要到一個參加公民訓練的朋友那裏去請求，他也要去軍訓。我呢，當然把我從前讀過的幾本新聞書，再想讀一遍，當然，我還得設法到前綫去實地練習一下，如果有可能的話。</p>
<p>苦悶，只是一時的情感作用，經過這一度的情感作用，我想信，以後是不會再有那種傻勁了，這也可説是一種教訓。</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Liulihe Station</h3>
<p>After being repelled, Japanese reinforcements arrive and a standoff ensues.  Heavy shelling also occurs in the densely populated areas of Tianjin General Station and East Station.  High-ranking officials in Nanjing express extreme indignation at the atrocities of the Japanese army. The current calm is the temporary tranquility before the storm.</p>
<p>[Baoding] On the night of the 30th, while a certain brigade of the 29th Army was moving, Japanese troops seized the opportunity to invade Liulihe Railway Station. After being repelled by a newly arrived unit, Japanese reinforcements arrived, and a standoff is currently underway. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Japanese army's continuous bombing of Tianjin is extremely brutal. Powerful figures here unanimously believe that this situation is sufficient to strengthen China's determination to resist Japan.  Currently, telegrams are pouring in to the central government from all parts of the country, vowing to defend to the death Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek's declaration that "once the war has begun, there is no room for compromise." This agency's reporter interviewed several high-ranking officials on the morning of the 31st, all of whom believed that the silence of the past 24 hours was like the temporary tranquility before the storm.  They repeatedly reiterated their passionate support for Commander-in-Chief Chiang's statement that "we can only launch a comprehensive plan to lead the whole country in a united struggle, and sacrifice to the utmost to defend the nation."  This morning, newspapers expressed extreme indignation at the Japanese army's bestial conduct in Tianjin, unanimously condemning the Japanese army's wanton destruction of cultural institutions, and especially denouncing the use of kerosene to burn Nankai University and neighboring villages.  Furthermore, the Japanese army's shooting of residents is utterly inhumane.  According to a report from neutral sources in Peiping, seven corpses of civilians were found in the suburbs of Peiping, all with their hands tied behind their backs, and the heads of two of them had been chopped off, clearly the work of the Japanese.  Other cruel acts are too numerous to mention.  Even the elderly, weak, women, and children are not spared.  Moreover, the bombing of Tianjin by aircraft was carried out without any warning to the local residents. Their cruelty and bloodthirstiness are particularly intolerable under international law.  Regarding what the enemy has claimed, that they have established so-called "local public order maintenance committees" in Peiping and Tianjin, our government unanimously believes that this is a trick of the Japanese side, a cover for Japanese military rule.  A certain important person said that the experience of the past in the Four Eastern Provinces and eastern Hebei has made the world deeply aware that this is a habitual trick of the Japanese. When Japanese military forces arrive in a certain place, they often threaten and entice local people to organize puppet organizations, while they themselves remain behind the scenes pulling the strings. In reality, as soon as the Japanese army withdraws, these puppet organizations immediately collapse.  The Japanese side is now planning to restage this ugly farce in Peiping and Tianjin. They may consider themselves clever, but people around the world have long been disgusted by it." (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Although Japanese troops are still engaged in battles with small units of Chinese soldiers in various places, the overall situation in northern Hebei has become relatively quiet. Tianjin has been completely occupied by the Japanese army. A Public Order Maintenance Committee has been formed in Peiping. After being heavily bombarded by Japanese artillery yesterday, the barracks at Xiyuan are now occupied by 2,000 Japanese soldiers. At the same time, Tianjin Acting Mayor Li Wentian notified the consular corps, stating that the security forces had completely withdrawn and requesting assistance in restoring normalcy in Tianjin. Everything is quiet in Tanggu. It is reported that Chinese troops have also withdrawn from Dagu, and ships can now enter and leave as usual. Yesterday, the security forces followed orders to return their weapons to the military depots. Those in the former Austrian concession abandoned their uniforms and fled. Another 300 members of the security forces marched in formation from the Third District and retreated south. Yesterday, a certain foreigner saw eleven corpses of Chinese police and seven corpses of civilians in the fields near the Yenching University campus in Nanhaitian. Their hands were all tied behind their backs, and several of them had been shot. Most had been hacked to death with knives. Two of the civilians had been decapitated. According to members of the Tongxian security forces encountered east of Peiping, in yesterday's battle in Tongxian, all the Japanese troops stationed there were wiped out. The security forces were forced to retreat due to the activity of Japanese aircraft, but many are now returning, it is said. According to Japanese sources, a column of Japanese mechanized troops, together with cavalry, fought the Tongxian security forces between Peiping and Tongxian yesterday. The Japanese troops used machine guns to disperse several hundred members of the security forces. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 31st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Last night, all the concessions here set up barriers at their entry points. There were no pedestrians on the roads, and it was quite quiet. But this morning, the Japanese army continued its mopping-up operations. At 4:30 AM, troops commanded by Akagi engaged in expelling Chinese soldiers from around a certain Japanese-owned yarn factory near the General Station. In the afternoon, Japanese troops resumed shelling the security forces in the densely populated area between the General Station and the East Station. Heavy rain fell, preventing Japanese aircraft from operating, but in the evening, two Japanese aircraft flew over Tianjin. Raids occurred frequently in various places. The main road from the Japanese concession to the General Station, including an important bridge, is now under Japanese control. The Japanese have now completed the systematic occupation of Tianjin and its special zones, with only the former German concession not yet occupied. A Peace Maintenance Committee is currently being organized. According to Japanese authorities, a certain foreigner's warehouse between the East Station and the Italian concession, and a certain building in the former Austrian concession, are still occupied by a large number of security forces. The Japanese side plans to bomb them, but the rain has prevented them from doing so. Today, all the concessions are implementing strict security measures, making it extremely difficult to travel between them. All the concessions are currently facing the problem of refugee congestion. Villagers in groups are now crowding the road between the racecourse and the British concession, and people from villages near the East Station are still constantly passing through the British concession along the riverbank to go elsewhere. Post office personnel resumed work this morning. Nankai University has been reduced to rubble, and the fire is still not extinguished this morning. Tanggu is quiet, Chinese troops have withdrawn from Dagu, and navigation has resumed as usual. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 31st)</p>
<h3>Baoding Military Vehicles Bombed</h3>
<p>[Baoding] (Delayed dispatch) Enemy aircraft came three times this morning after 7:00 AM, each time only one plane, reconnoitering and then leaving. At 1:30 PM, seven planes came again, in formation. After circling over the provincial capital, they flew to the Xiguan Railway Station and dropped ten bombs, and strafed Xiguan Street with machine guns, destroying four military vehicles parked at the south end of the station. Bullets exploded at the same time, injuring and killing more than ten soldiers. They also dropped bombs on Train No. 41 heading south on the Pinghan Railway, killing and injuring more than 40 passengers. Several pedestrians on Xiguan Street were also shot dead by machine guns. The remaining fire from the bullets has not been completely extinguished, and the true situation is still under investigation. The security police and military in the city and suburbs have temporarily stepped up security precautions, and order is as usual. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Shell Hebei</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources, at 2:30 PM on the 31st, Japanese troops again shelled areas outside the Hebei Railway and Dongjuzi, etc., for dozens of rounds without stopping, causing many civilian casualties and destroying many civilian houses. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Hankou Japanese Concession Prepares for War</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The Hankou Japanese Concession security conference resolved to form a situational committee, with Consul Matsudaira as chairman. They also formed a civilian police force and an intelligence team, and actively purchased military supplies, preparing for war. The Japanese cruiser "Kurishima" also brought 130 marines to Hankou. The Japanese Nisshin Steamship Company was ordered to close its business, dismiss Chinese staff, and have Japanese staff return to their country. The Taian Yarn Factory and Mitsui &amp; Co. are also rushing to close down. Many Japanese women and children have returned to their country. Our officials and people remain extremely calm, and public order is solid. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>

<h3>Tianjin Refugees Tragically Slaughtered</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Nanjing received a Tianjin dispatch stating that on the morning of the 31st, Japanese troops continued to set fires on Huangwei Road in Hebei, with many civilian houses and shops being burned. More than ten Japanese planes also circled in the sky, reconnoitering various places. At around 10:00 AM, Japanese troops shelled various places in the suburbs, causing heavy damage to various tall buildings. At around 11:00 AM, heavy rain fell, slightly halting the Japanese army's cruel acts. Tens of thousands of refugees from the Hebei area fled to the concessions for shelter. A portion of them were stopped in the Third Special District and are now being housed in the former site of the Qianxin Trading Company, the East Tianxian Theater, and various empty houses, but without anyone providing relief, they are without food all day, their cries shaking the heavens, a truly miserable sight. According to refugees who escaped, Japanese troops set fires everywhere in Hebei on the night of the 30th. The municipal hospital is now overcrowded with refugees. On the morning of the 31st, a large number of refugees, numbering more than ten thousand, continued to cross the International Bridge into the French concession, mostly with nowhere to go, and slept on the roadside at night. When asked about their escape, everyone shed tears. They all lived in areas outside the railway in Hebei and Hedong. When Japanese troops arrived, they first set fires, then strafed with machine guns, causing families to scatter and loved ones to be separated during the escape. Furthermore, some who saw their wives and children being shot and went forward to help were also murdered by the Japanese army, a truly tragic scene. Such atrocities are unprecedented in the world. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to reports from relevant sources, on the afternoon of the 31st, Japanese troops conducted house-to-house searches in the Hebei area of Tianjin, arbitrarily slaughtering people, and ordered various shops to open for business. Dongma Road and Hebei Dama Road are now patrolled by Japanese soldiers, and there is no one on the streets. Refugees and wounded security forces in the municipal hospital were evacuated on the afternoon of the 31st, as rumors spread that Japanese aircraft would bomb it on the afternoon of the 31st. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Fenglin Village Reduced to Ashes</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Nanjing received a Tianjin dispatch stating that Nilin Village outside the Hedong Railway has now been completely bombarded by artillery fired by Japanese troops, and all houses have been reduced to ashes. The Japanese army began shelling at 3:00 PM on the 31st, and the shelling continued for more than an hour. The village was originally a residential area for the poor, and the number of those who failed to escape beforehand was estimated to be in the thousands. After this continuous bombardment, it is feared that few survived. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Nanjing received a Tianjin dispatch stating that, starting at noon on the 31st, Japanese troops bombed the Fenglin Village area in Hedong with artillery, which did not stop until 5:00 PM. Now tens of thousands of nearby residents are fleeing along the Hai River bank, hoping to cross the river into the British concession, but to no avail. Drenched by heavy rain and with nowhere to turn, they are still wandering on the riverbank, a very pitiful sight. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to relevant sources, a report from Tianjin stated that Japanese troops erected artillery in the middle of Dajing Road in Hebei at 2:00 PM on the 31st, aiming and firing at the Mint, which has now been hit and is on fire. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tianjin Wound French Soldiers</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] According to French sources, Japanese soldiers clashed with French soldiers today, and opened fire, wounding two French soldiers and killing one Annamese soldier. This was because Japanese soldiers were angered by not being able to pass through the French concession, and when they encountered several French soldiers and Annamese soldiers at the East Station, they attempted to disarm them and, beforehand, tried to blindfold the French soldiers with cloth. The French soldiers refused to comply and resisted, so the Japanese soldiers opened fire. The French authorities are very angry about this and have lodged a protest. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Foreign sources in Nanjing stated that on the 30th, a French non-commissioned officer and a soldier stationed in Tianjin were disarmed by Japanese troops at the Tianjin East Station, and they attempted to blindfold them. The non-commissioned officer resisted and was killed. An Annamese soldier was also killed. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei Discusses the Significance of the Final Moment</h3>
<p>Be patient when the time has not yet come; be prepared to sacrifice when the time has come.  Be sure to turn people and land to ashes, and leave no seed of a puppet.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Chairman Wang recently gave an important speech entitled "The Final Moment." The following is an excerpt from the original speech:</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, on the 15th of this month, I said a few words to you about saving the nation and preserving its existence. What I want to say now is to elaborate on those few words. On the 15th of this month, the Lugouqiao Incident had already occurred for several days. At that time, I said that although the evolution of this incident could not be predicted, this incident was definitely not accidental, but a pre-planned one. Therefore, we can only respond according to our established policy. As for the 17th, Commander-in-Chief Chiang had already solemnly announced the policy in the first session of the talks, and all the newspapers across the country had published it, which all of you comrades have seen. Among them, there is a most clear and most important sentence, which says that China has reached its final moment today. Now I would like to explain the four words "final moment." We remember that in the Fifth Plenary Session in November 1935, Commander-in-Chief Chiang once said, "If peace is not completely hopeless, we will never lightly abandon peace; if sacrifice is not at the final moment, we will never lightly speak of sacrifice." These words have been clearly explained in the Second Plenary Session, and the diplomatic policy of the Third Plenary Session is also based on these words. We know that Japan's aggression against China is endless. Since September 18th, it has been killing its way into China step by step, while China has been retreating step by step. Why has China been retreating step by step? Because China is six or seventy years behind Japan in terms of progress. China's national power cannot withstand Japan's aggression. So, what has been the policy of China's diplomacy and domestic affairs since September 18th? To sum it up, diplomatically, it cannot stop Japan from killing its way in step by step, and can only think of ways to make it advance more slowly. China has no choice but to retreat step by step, and can only think of ways to make us retreat more slowly. Why do we want to slow down? Is it to take this opportunity to live in ease and seek temporary comfort? No, we just want to take advantage of this slowness to free up some time to do various preparatory work in domestic affairs to strengthen our resistance. This has been the policy of China's diplomacy and domestic affairs since September 18th. Since September 18th, China has appealed to the League of Nations over the September 18th Incident, originally wanting to use the League of Nations' moral sanctions, economic sanctions, and military sanctions to prevent Japan from killing its way into China step by step. However, in fact, apart from some minor moral sanctions, there was no hope of economic or military sanctions from the League of Nations. Therefore, Japan's killing its way in step by step has not stopped, and the three northeastern provinces have successively fallen. At this time, we can only do some work to call on the whole country to unite sincerely and face the national crisis together. However, these works are only just beginning and have not yet achieved anything. As a result of Japan's killing its way in step by step, the September 18th Incident progressed to the January 28th Incident. With the bitter fighting of the 19th Route Army, the 5th Army, and the reinforcements from various places, and the good offices of the League of Nations investigation team, Shanghai fell in early March, resulting in the signing of the Shanghai Truce Agreement. The Shanghai Truce Agreement was naturally a major loss, but the reason why this agreement was signed at that time was to make Japan advance more slowly and us retreat more slowly, taking advantage of this slowness to quickly do various preparatory work, such as the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi being able to proceed and the road network in the southeastern provinces being able to be completed. Was this worth it or not? Let the public judge. After the Shanghai Truce Agreement, in just over a year, the Rehe War and the battles at the various passes of the Great Wall broke out again. Japan's killing its way in step by step became even tighter. By the time our army was defeated, Rehe had fallen, and the various passes of the Great Wall had also successively fallen, there was the Tanggu Truce Agreement. This was naturally an even greater loss, but the reason why this agreement was signed at that time was to make Japan advance more slowly and us retreat more slowly, taking advantage of this slowness to quickly do various preparatory work. We realized that there were too many shortcomings in terms of spirit and material, that our resistance was weak and fragmented, and that we could not fully unleash the resistance of the entire country and the entire nation. Moreover, there were many who were pulling us back from the side and the rear, so in terms of spirit, we sought unity, organization, improvement, and accelerated training, and in terms of material, national defense equipment and national economic construction progressed simultaneously. In two or three years, there was some achievement in terms of spirit, and the achievement in terms of material also had numbers to calculate. The cause of unification cannot be said to be completed, but it cannot be said that there was no progress. As for the suppression of bandits, the southeastern provinces were successively cleared. Was this worth it or not? Let the public judge. After the Tanggu Truce Agreement, what continued to happen were the issues of through traffic and through mail. Under the principle of not recognizing the puppet state, we reluctantly resolved the issue of through traffic by not using puppet state train tickets and the issue of through mail by not using puppet state postage stamps. As for the issue of through navigation, we are still continuing to insist. And in June 1935, Japan's killing its way in became tighter step by step. From May 25th, verbal negotiations continued until June 9th. In view of the situation, we had no choice but to make various emergency dispositions, because by June 12th, it would be the time for Japan to act freely. These various emergency dispositions, which were a major loss, were indeed unbearable and unyielding, but we still endured and yielded. The reason why we did so at that time was to make Japan advance more slowly and us retreat more slowly. For this reason, various preparatory work could still be carried out, and we did our best to work hard in terms of spirit and material. In the meantime, such as the completion of the suppression of bandits in the southwest, the unification of Guangdong and Guangxi, etc. Was this worth it or not? Let the public judge. We have endured and yielded in this way for a full six years. We cannot but think that this killing its way in step by step is endless, and that this retreating step by step is endless. Moreover, our preparations, we know, and Japan also knows. We can frankly say, "These preparations are all necessary for modern countries. We rely on this to be an enemy to others, and we also rely on this to be a friend to others. Whether we are an enemy or a friend does not only depend on us, but also depends on others." However, Japan will say this, "We not only do not allow you to be an enemy to me, but also do not allow you to be a friend to me." Then our preparations will not only fail to achieve the result of slowing down, but will instead awaken Japan to accelerate its killing its way in step by step. It is impossible not to prepare in this way, but it is impossible to prepare. When we think of ways to retreat step by step, we cannot but draw a final line. Before this final moment, we allow ourselves to think of ways. It is best not to retreat, but if we have to retreat, we should try our best to retreat more slowly. But when we reach this final moment, we will all stand still and cannot retreat any further. As we said before, if peace is not completely hopeless, we will never abandon peace; if sacrifice is not at the final moment, we will never lightly speak of sacrifice. When the "time has not yet come," we must have the greatest determination and courage to endure; and when the "time has come," we must have the greatest determination and courage to sacrifice. If we had sacrificed rashly without enduring in the past, then the sacrifice would have been meaningless. If we still talk about preparation without sacrificing today, then the preparation would be even more meaningless. The two words "sacrifice" are harsh. We sacrifice ourselves, and we must also make all the people of the country sacrifice together, because we are a weak country, and we are the people of a weak country. What we call resistance has no other content. Its content is only sacrifice. We must make every person and every piece of land become ashes, so that the enemy will not get anything in their hands. This meaning is certainly harsh, but if we do not do this, there will be even harsher things following behind. In terms of substance, if we do not sacrifice, then there will only be puppets. In Chinese history, there have been several times when it was half-conquered by foreign races, and twice when it was completely conquered. These conquests were not because the invaders could kill all 400 million of us or destroy all our more than 4 million square kilometers of land, but because after a few people with spirit died, most of the people without spirit offered their own bodies and all their land to the invaders as a place of wealth and honor. Therefore, the invaders were able to easily get most of us and all the land. Are we still going to be puppets today? If we don't be puppets, we have to sacrifice. We are a weak country, and we are the people of a weak country. When it comes to defeating others, we may not be able to do it, but when it comes to sacrificing ourselves, no matter how weak we are, there is no reason why we cannot do it. If we cannot do it, it is because we do not want to, not because we cannot. The so-called not wanting is that we do not have the determination to sacrifice, but only the determination to be a puppet. We not only sacrifice ourselves because we do not want to be puppets, but we also do not want to see our compatriots become puppets after we sacrifice ourselves. Therefore, we must force our compatriots to sacrifice together, leaving no seed of a puppet. Whether it is in a bustling city or in a remote village, we must turn people and land to ashes. Although we cannot stop the enemy from killing its way in, we will certainly be able to ensure that the enemy will get nothing after killing its way in. For several years, we have been racking our brains, talking about unity, talking about organization, and talking about training, so that at the final moment, we can mobilize the spiritual power of the entire country and the entire nation to control and use the various material constructions that have been accumulated over time, and strengthen our resistance to aggression. The so-called resistance is to be able to make the entire country and the entire nation sacrifice for resisting aggression. If there are no weak people in the world, then there are no strong people in the world. Then, after we have sacrificed, our goal of resistance will also be achieved. We shout out one sentence: the final moment! We shout out another sentence even louder: Sacrifice! (Central News Agency dispatch from the 31st)</p>

<h3>Shen Junru and Others Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Will Go to the Capital Today to Listen to Instructions and Return to Shanghai Within a Week; Shen Expresses Continued Efforts in the National Salvation Movement</p>
<p>[Suzhou] Shen Junru, Li Gongpu, Shi Liang, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, Wang Zaoshi, Zhang Naiqi, and others, seven in total, who were detained in the Suzhou High Court Detention Center for suspicion of endangering the Republic of China for more than half a year, have now been approved by the High Court for release on bail. Shen Junru was bailed out by Zhang Yipeng, Zhang Naiqi by Li Genyuan, Wang Zaoshi by Tao Jiayao, Li Gongpu by Lu Zhushuang, Zou Taofen by Zhang Yipeng, Sha Qianli by Qian Zichu, and Shi Liang by Pan Jingbao. After completing the procedures, family members and lawyers Jing Shucheng, Zhuang Xiang, and more than thirty others went to the detention branch to welcome them at around 2 PM on the 31st.</p>
<p>Welcome Upon Release</p>
<p>At 5 PM, Shi Liang was first released from the Siqian Street Detention Center and took a car to the Hengjie Detention Branch in Wu County to meet with Shen Junru and others. At 5:20 PM, all seven were released from the detention center. Warden Zhu Gang personally escorted them to the gate. When they came out of the gate, one or two hundred people stood under the scorching sun, shouting slogans of welcome and resistance against Japan to save the country. At that moment, military music played, firecrackers crackled, and cheers soared into the clouds, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Dozens of representatives and students sent by various parties held flags and led the way, followed by Shen and others, with their family members following behind. Shen and others initially sat in rickshaws, but then all walked, with the welcoming crowd shouting slogans all the way out of the city gate, along the main road, and to the Huayuan Hotel, where they rested in a private room. By this time, it was already half past six. At around 7 PM, Li Genyuan, Zhang Yipeng, and many others hosted a public banquet for Shen and others at the rooftop garden of the Guohuo Company. They are scheduled to take the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train at around 1 AM this morning (1st) to go to Beijing to listen to instructions, planning to stay for about a week before returning to Shanghai. The High Court's ruling is appended below:</p>
<p>High Court Ruling</p>
<p>(Main Text) The defendants Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, and Shi Liang shall each submit a guarantee from a substantial person or business worth 200 yuan to be allowed to suspend detention. (Reason) According to the provisions of Article 111, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, when permitting an application for suspension of detention, a guarantee shall be ordered to be submitted, and a corresponding guarantee amount shall be specified. The applicants Shen Gang et al. stated that the various defendants Shen Junru et al. in the case of endangering the Republic of China have been detained for half a year, causing mental distress, and their families have lost their support. They applied for suspension of detention. This court finds no impropriety in the examination and approval and should approve it. However, the applicant shall submit a guarantee from a substantial person or business worth 200 yuan in order to be released on bail. This ruling is made as in the main text. July 30, 26th year, Presiding Judge Zhu Songzhou, Judge Zhang Zepu, Judge Li Yue. Luo Qing, who was also detained in the case, was also released on bail at the same time on the 31st.</p>
<p>Shen Junru's Remarks</p>
<p>When Shen and others were released from prison, they were as lively as ever, and their attitude towards resisting the enemy and saving the country was still very active. According to Shen Junru's words to the reporter, Junru and others have been detained by the court for more than half a year. Although in prison, they felt quite comfortable physically. This time, the judicial authorities ruled to allow the suspension of detention. As for the future outcome of this case, they will naturally listen to the court's decision. As Junru and others stepped out of the prison gate today, seeing the call for resistance against the enemy spreading throughout the country, they felt extremely happy in their hearts. They will not change their original intention and vowed to strive for the liberation of the nation and the people. (Special dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>Singing the March of the Volunteers</p>
<p>[Suzhou] After Shen Junru and others were released on bail today, they stayed at the Huayuan Hotel. When they arrived at the hotel entrance, the Wu County Anti-Enemy Support Association Song Troupe asked Shen and others to express their opinions. Shen and others had no opinions because they had just been released from prison. However, in order to show their spirit, they sang the March of the Volunteers with the troupe once. After singing, led by Shi Liang, they shouted "Long live the Republic of China, long live!" Then Shen and others bowed to the troupe and dispersed. At 7 PM, Shen and others and their families went to the Guohuo Company's third-floor restaurant to attend the welcoming banquet hosted by Zhang Shenren and others. During the banquet, people from all walks of life asked Shen and others to express their opinions. They replied that they would not change their original purpose and would unite the country to resist Japan and save the country. Shen and others decided to visit each guarantor tomorrow morning to express their gratitude and then go to Beijing to meet with various authorities and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for instructions, planning to stay for about a week before returning to Shanghai.

<h3>National Government Issues Order to Commend Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu</h3>
<p>Posthumously Awarded the Rank of Army General and Given Generous Posthumous Compensation; Their Life Deeds Will Be Recorded and Publicized in the National History Museum</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government issued a clear order on the 31st, stating that Tong Linge, Deputy Commander of the 29th Army of the Army, and Zhao Dengyu, Commander of the 132nd Division of the Army, were skilled in military strategy and had led their troops for a long time. In the Northern Expedition to Suppress Bandits and the battles at Xifengkou, they were able to defeat the enemy and make meritorious contributions. This time, in the battle in Beiping, they both took defending the country and preserving its territory as their duty. They repeatedly charged forward, fighting fiercely and fearlessly. Their loyalty and bravery are enough to inspire morale and set an example for the military. Unfortunately, they were trapped in heavy encirclement and died in battle. Remembering their heroism, we deeply mourn their loss. Tong Linge and Zhao Dengyu are both posthumously awarded the rank of Army General, and the Executive Yuan will be instructed to grant generous posthumous compensation. Their life deeds will be recorded and publicized in the National History Museum to honor their loyalty and inspire future generations. This is the order.

<h3>Japanese Bombing of Tianjin Has Horrified the World</h3>
<p>British Newspaper Laments the Decline of International Morality; U.S. President Does Not Take Vacation to Pay Attention to the Overall Situation</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the Japanese bombing of Tianjin, the News Chronicle here published an editorial stating that the incident has horrified the world, but not deeply enough. The newspaper said, "Japan can certainly escape its consequences, as the bombing of this large city is nothing more than a common event after even greater aggression occurs. The extent to which international morality has declined can be evidenced by the world's indifferent inaction towards the Japanese bombing of Tianjin. In the past, such as the ancient Spanish city of Guernica, and more recently the Spanish capital of Madrid, and now Tianjin in China, or even London in the future being bombed by the enemy, the world will also turn a blind eye, and only the people of London will feel the pain." (Reuters dispatch of the 31st from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons debated foreign policy for the last time today. Foreign Secretary Eden expressed regret over the changes in the Far East situation and said that Britain would continue to liaise with France and the United States. After discussing Mediterranean policy and the non-intervention issue, it was announced that the session would be adjourned until October 21st. If there is an emergency, a meeting can be convened earlier. Around October 26th, the King will personally attend the opening ceremony. (Reuters dispatch of the 30th from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons held its last meeting today before the adjournment. Members of Parliament from the government and opposition parties engaged in heated debate on foreign policy and general international issues. The speech by Major Attlee, Chairman of the Labor Party caucus, regarding the conflict between China and Japan in the Far East, made a significant impression in the chamber. Attlee believed that the conflict between China and Japan had deteriorated and become a "real war." He said, "This conflict seems to have broken out and become a war. We know that this disturbance originated from local events, and I dare not say that the Japanese government should be fully responsible for the actions of the Japanese army. However, the Japanese army has no right to operate on the Pinghan Railway, which I know for sure. China has always been patient to the greatest extent, with the aim of maintaining peace. However, as a result of China's patience, Japan has made further progress in aggression. The actions of the Japanese army this time are just another infringement on China's territorial integrity."

<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull said that the U.S. government has not held talks with any other country in hopes of stopping the fighting between Chinese and Japanese troops in North China. He also said that the United States is currently consulting with the governments of the countries concerned to exchange information on the situation in the Far East, but collective action is not being considered. In short, the United States is still taking a detached approach to the events in the Far East. (Havas dispatch of the 30th from Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>American and Russian Newspapers Criticize Japanese Military Aggression</h3>
<p>Disregarding All Treaty Constraints; The Interests of All Countries Are Affected</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Times published another commentary today, strongly criticizing the aggressive behavior of the Japanese military, titled "Japan's Desperate Gamble." The article first stated that Japan has rejected the advice of Britain and the United States and that it would be futile for Western countries to expect the Tokyo authorities to change their current policies. Japan has often disregarded the advice of other countries in the past six years, and the interests of all countries have been severely affected. It has disregarded all treaty constraints and has not sought a peaceful solution with China to resolve the differences between the two countries. Now that the situation is becoming more serious, Japan will naturally regard the advice of Western countries with even greater contempt. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Communist Party's organ newspaper, Pravda, published an article stating that the defensive strength of the Chinese army is increasing day by day. The 19th Route Army of China had already proven its prowess in the Shanghai War in 1932. The Chinese army is not only elite, but its equipment is also quite good. The results of the Suiyuan War last year were enough to make the Chinese army more confident. The results of the recent fighting between Chinese troops and the Japanese regular army near Beiping are also sufficient to prove the true value of the Chinese army, as the Japanese army is not only better equipped but also has more personnel. Once China and Japan go to war, Japan will not only need a large number of personnel, but the financial burden will also be enormous. If the war is prolonged, the morale of the Japanese army will inevitably decline. In short, the Japanese warlords are now playing with fire, which the sober-minded bourgeoisie in that country also deeply know the danger of. (Havas dispatch of the 30th from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Rome] The newspaper "Stampa" commented on the situation in the Far East, believing that the events in the Far East, especially the arrival of the Japanese army in Beiping, are of extremely important significance. "Japan's expansionist policy is like an oil slick on the water, expanding day by day. It can be asserted that even if the international community wants to reject it, it may be difficult, because diplomatic weapons are no longer effective."

<h3>Staff Officer of the Japanese Military Department Flies to Meet with Prince De</h3>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] Three staff officers from the Kwantung Army, divided into two planes, arrived in Huate from Rehe on the 29th to meet with Prince De and others. They flew back on the original planes on the morning of the 30th. It is said that they conveyed an important mission from their military department, entrusting the traitor to carry it out. The details are unknown. At around 5 AM on the morning of the 30th, there were planes in the western direction of the sky over Zhangyuan. Because the weather was cloudy and rainy, and the dawn was hazy, the markings and number of the planes were not identified. And because it was very early, few residents knew about it, and the situation was peaceful as usual. (Special dispatch of the 30th)</p>

<h3>After Yin, the Traitor, Was Captured, Chi Zongmo Succeeded Him in the Puppet Position</h3>

<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese Garrison Headquarters has now officially announced that Yin Rugeng, the traitor, has been captured by the righteous security forces.

<p>[Tianjin] The Japanese military headquarters announced that Yin Rugeng, the head of the East Hebei government, had been captured. Lieutenant General Kagetoshi, the commander of the Japanese army, has appointed Chi Zongmo as acting head of the government to handle all affairs. (Allied Press dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Today, a Chinese eyewitness to the incident in Ji talked about the fact that when the Tongzhou Security Force revolted on the 29th, he was awakened in the early morning, but he heard the security force shouting to kill the bandits. The Japanese military camp was immediately surrounded by the security force, and a fierce battle broke out between the two sides. The sound of cannons, machine guns, and rifles rang out at once. Countless Japanese soldiers were killed. In the afternoon, 30 Japanese planes flew in and bombed for several hours. The security force gradually lost ground and retreated. The houses of the Tongzhou puppet government were completely destroyed, and the gatehouse of the American school was also damaged. The rest were unharmed, and the American teachers Martin and Henderson escaped safely. (Reuters dispatch of the 31st from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] According to a Japanese military spokesman, Chi Zongmo has now succeeded Yin, the traitor, and Kagetoshi has formally appointed him. The Japanese troops in Tongzhou have broken out of the encirclement after being bombed by reinforcements. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 31st)</p>
<p>[Baoding] Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian, commanders of the security forces stationed in Tongxian County, issued a public telegram on the 30th after their uprising. The original text is as follows (titles omitted): "The Japanese bandits are tyrannical, and Heaven has brought disaster to China. Qingyu and Yantian were ordered to establish the First and Second Special Police Security Regiments in the war zone after the Tanggu Truce Agreement was forced upon us by the enemy after the Battle of the Great Wall. For the convenience of unified command and bandit suppression, we temporarily came under the command and dispatch of Yin Rugeng, the administrative inspector of the Ji-Mi District. Originally, we hoped to work together to stabilize the local area and appease the people. Unexpectedly, Yin, the traitor, was blinded by greed and willingly acted as a puppet, driven by the enemy, betraying the party and the country, and abandoned by both gods and men. At that time, it would not have been difficult to capture him, the chief bandit, and offer him as a prisoner to the central government. However, because the country was in trouble and the strategy was to be friendly with our neighbors, and more importantly because we had not received orders, we had to make a false show of compliance, enduring humiliation and waiting for an opportunity. Recently, the enemy's flames have become more intense, and the national crisis has deepened. The Lugouqiao Incident is nothing more than the beginning of the annexation of the entire North China. Yin Rugeng and others, insane, have been plundering the local area and draining the pond to catch fish. They have specially set up a supply committee to plan supplies for the enemy and maintain the rear. On the 28th, the enemy bombed our 29th Army troops stationed in Tong County with a regiment of troops, plus airplanes and artillery. When the enemy's artillery fired, the entire army wept. What time is this? Yin, the traitor, led his close followers and watched from the city walls, taking pleasure in it. Qingyu and Yantian believe that the enemy is plotting against us with determination. Only through concerted efforts and obedience to the leaders can we achieve the effect of saving the country and resisting aggression. How can we occupy the border for long? We are ashamed to be behind others in serving the country. Therefore, at dawn on the 29th, we swore an oath with tears, and with a single drumbeat, we shattered the various organs of the puppet organization, as well as the garrison team, the special service agency, and the police station of the violent Japanese in Tongzhou, capturing the traitors and the Japanese. On that day, we fought with the Japanese planes in flesh and blood. In addition to sending Liu Honglian, the director of the General Affairs Office of our department, to Baoding to meet with the superior and ask for instructions, all future actions will be in accordance with the orders of Chairmen Chiang and Song. We hope that the advanced elements in the country and the national army in all places will provide us with guidance and assistance. We are extremely anxious. Specially reported, Zhang Qingyu, commander of the First Special Security Regiment of Hebei Province, Zhang Yantian, commander of the Second Regiment, and the entire officers and soldiers of the Teaching Corps, 20,000 in all, respectfully salute.

<p>Weekly Forum</p>
<h3>The Psychology of Bare Survival</h3>
<p>— Tao Xisheng</p>
<p>Today, the most beneficial thing for the enemy country is the division of the Chinese people themselves. Today, the enemy country’s most ferocious policy is to promote the self-division of China under the overwhelming pressure of Mount Tai. Look at how it advances into Chinese territory on one hand, and declares it will not expand the situation, and continues to talk about peace on the other. This is exactly what it is saying to the Chinese people: “If you don’t dare to fight, there is a way out here.” If the Chinese people really take the way out it leaves, the result will only be division, and the result of division is destruction.</p>
<p>The obvious path to destruction is treaties that forfeit rights and humiliate the nation. This is what the enemy country wants to obtain, but it is not easy to obtain such a treaty from any Chinese person. If the Chinese people do not suffer defeat, they will not agree to its treaties, and what it obtains will not be much. The enemy country sees this clearly, and in addition to using force to obtain such treaties, it goes a step further, using a method of high pressure on one hand and leaving a way out on the other, to dissolve the Chinese people’s psychology of unity against foreign aggression and to disrupt the Chinese people’s unified steps against foreign aggression. Its success will certainly be greater and more extensive than obvious treaties.</p>
<p>On the ways out it leaves, two types of people will embark on them. The first type of person believes that they can exist by betraying the nation and the government, and therefore actively betrays the nation and the government and becomes attached to the enemy country. Formally, the enemy country does not annex this piece of territory, but only that the Republic of China is betrayed, and even the emblem of the Republic of China can be retained. This type of person believes that doing so is beneficial for private gain, and can maintain an independent existence, and can avoid annexation, not only avoiding the crisis of destruction, but also surviving in this world.</p>
<p>The second type of person believes that they can exist by leaving the nation and the government, and therefore passively leaves the nation and the government to seek their own survival. This type of person can be further divided into two major categories.</p>
<p>The first category believes that the government’s policy towards the enemy is too strong and not suitable for mitigating the enemy country’s aggression, and therefore breaks away from the government to seek reconciliation with the enemy country. The psychology of survival of this type of person is excusable. Before China has the strength to fight a major war, making concessions for the sake of temporary ease seems to be a solution. However, the enemy country can use this psychology of ours to obtain considerable benefits and preparations for our destruction.</p>
<p>The second category believes that the government’s policy towards the enemy is too weak and not suitable for saving the nation and seeking survival, and therefore does not follow the government but seeks its own way out. This type of person can be further divided into two factions.</p>
<p>The first faction consistently advocates a strong policy but is dissatisfied with the government. This faction knows that although the government’s policy is not strong enough, if one were to take measures to resist the government because of this, and to achieve a strong policy by splitting up, then before the strong policy is realized, the government’s strength against the enemy would already be dispersed. This faction of people can only change to supporting the government’s attitude now.</p>
<p>The second faction outwardly advocates a strong policy but in reality caters to the enemy country’s psychology. They oppose the government with high-sounding rhetoric, using this rhetoric as a defense for opposing the government, but in reality, they are seeking their own division and dispersing China’s strength against foreign aggression. In the eyes of the enemy country, this method is very beneficial, not only tolerating their activities but even protecting their activities.</p>
<p>The first type of person is a complete traitor, which needs no explanation. Among the second type of people, the second faction of the second category is also a traitor, which is not easy to see. The first category of the second type, despite its infinite subjective grievances, ultimately cannot achieve objective results. The first faction of the second category of the second type, if it can abandon its subjective distress and objectively serve the integrity and existence of the country, is worthy of our admiration. In short, “When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact” is a saying that very well fits China’s current situation. If we want to be an intact egg under the overturned nest, no matter how subjective we are, we are objectively in danger of self-division. Today, only by unanimously holding the attitude of not splitting up and not surviving in humiliation can we find a way out. If one takes the predetermined way out of the enemy country with the psychology of surviving in humiliation, even with the sincerity of preserving the country’s territory, one will inevitably be fooled. Those who do not have this sincerity but use high-sounding rhetoric as a defense cannot have their motives questioned.</p>
<h3>Germany and Russia Vigorously Denounce Each Other on the Spanish Question</h3>
<p>The Non-Intervention Committee Again Reaches an Impasse; British Representative Again Negotiates a Compromise</p>
<p>[London] The British delegation to the Non-Intervention Committee began seeking ways to break the deadlock and reconcile differences tonight, but its nature is still unknown. It will inevitably seek a compromise based on the opinions expressed by the representatives of Germany, Italy, Portugal, and Russia. The UK, in view of the seriousness of the situation resulting from the current deadlock, is working hard on this. (31st National Maritime Telecommunications)</p>
<p>[London] After examination by the subcommittee, it was felt that the general opinions were still coordinated, but other important difficulties were discovered. After a brief discussion of these difficulties, the meeting was adjourned. No decision has been made on when the next meeting will be convened. Plymouth, after convening the meeting, also said in his brief report that the answers from the various countries were generally still harmonious, but the granting of belligerent rights to combat groups was a fundamental difficulty. Furthermore, the implementation procedures after the plan is passed are also a matter of contention. The withdrawal of volunteers and the recognition of belligerent rights of combat groups are related in order, which is quite difficult to reconcile. (30th Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Coordination Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War failed to reach a compromise on the British compromise plan today. One reason is that the Soviet Union has consistently opposed recognizing the belligerent status of both parties in the civil war while foreign volunteers in Spain have not been completely withdrawn. The second reason is that Italy and Germany still insist that the recognition of belligerent status should precede the withdrawal of volunteers. For this reason, the deadlock on non-intervention continues. It is reported that the second meeting of the subcommittee will be held on August 5. Before this date, Chairman Committee, namely British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, will probably begin negotiations to persuade the Soviet Union and Germany and Italy to change their positions. As for the future, there are two different views. Optimists believe that the countries concerned have repeatedly expressed their commitment to the non-intervention agreement and will not bear the responsibility for the complete failure of the non-intervention measures. However, pessimists believe that the hope of success for the compromise plan proposed by the UK on July 14 is now extremely weak. (30th Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Coordination Committee for Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a meeting this afternoon. The recent speeches of German representative Ribbentrop and Soviet representative Maisky have attracted much attention. The two men attacked each other, each accusing the other of deliberately undermining the non-intervention measures. Ribbentrop said that the Soviet Union had brazenly refused to recognize both parties in the Spanish civil war as belligerents, and that these people had destroyed the British compromise plan. The Soviet Union had accepted the British compromise plan as a basis for discussion on the 16th of this month, but now it refuses to accept the recognition of belligerents, which is strange. If the countries do not recognize the authority of General Franco, the leader of the Spanish National Army, and say that General Franco can first implement the surveillance system in his jurisdiction, who will believe it? In conclusion, he said that the attitude adopted by the Soviet Union has created a completely different new situation for Germany, and Germany has to reserve its attitude. French representative Corbin then spoke, explaining that France had made various concessions in order to ensure that the British compromise plan could be successful. The British compromise plan clearly advocated that the recognition of both parties in the Spanish civil war should be conditional on the prior withdrawal of volunteers from various countries. This order is the true essence of the British compromise plan. It is inappropriate for the German representative to attach more importance to the order of discussion than to the procedure of implementation. Soviet representative Maisky then spoke, saying that whether or not countries are sincere about non-intervention in the Spanish civil war can be best tested by the withdrawal of volunteers. If the non-intervention measures fail because a compromise cannot be reached on the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers, then there is no doubt as to who is responsible. As for the recognition of both parties in the Spanish civil war as belligerents, it is irrelevant to the non-intervention measures. Even if the belligerent status of combat groups in the Spanish civil war is not recognized, the non-intervention measures can continue to be carried out. Maisky also said that it is strange that the governments of Italy and Germany did not raise the issue of recognition in the past six months, but now they are raising it when the United Kingdom and other countries are advocating the withdrawal of volunteers. In conclusion, he said that if the non-intervention measures fail, the responsibility should be borne by Italy and Germany. (30th Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the British compromise plan for non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, nine countries have submitted replies, which have just been published by the Coordination Committee. Among them, the reply from the British government is completely accepted without reservation, which is expected. In addition, the replies from Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden stated that although they are willing to accept it in principle, they believe that the large-scale withdrawal of foreign volunteers from Spain is a necessary condition for recognizing both parties in the Spanish civil war as belligerents. The reply submitted by the French government also stated that it was accepted with the condition that surveillance system be restored and that it could be accepted after a large-scale withdrawal of foreign volunteers. It also stated that although the French government could recognize that both parties in the Spanish civil war enjoy belligerent rights in the sea, land, and air, considerable restrictions should be added. The German reply advocated that the withdrawal of foreign volunteers and the recognition that both parties in the Spanish civil war enjoy belligerent rights in the sea, land, and air should be implemented simultaneously. The replies from Italy and Portugal fully accepted all the points contained in the British compromise plan, but advocated immediately recognizing both parties in the Spanish civil war as belligerents. The reply submitted by the Soviet government firmly rejected the level that the recognition of belligerent status should be negotiated immediately by the United Kingdom with both parties in the Spanish civil war, saying that the Soviet Union could reconsider it only after all foreign volunteers, including Moroccan natives, had been withdrawn from Spain. (31st Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The House of Commons held its last meeting today. Labour Party leader Attlee raised various facts on the Spanish issue, proving that the Spanish rebels are relying on the assistance of various countries to quickly determine the situation of the civil war, while the Spanish government forces will ultimately be hindered by one-sided non-intervention measures. He then said that the Spanish rebels have become vassals of foreign countries, and the British government must not recognize them as belligerents. Then, Foreign Secretary Eden rose to answer, with quite skillful wording, roughly saying that the non-intervention system is not purely British, but international. If the League of Nations is willing to handle the Spanish incident itself, the United Kingdom would be happy to welcome it, but so far we have not seen the League of Nations have this intention. Then, former Prime Minister Lloyd George, a Liberal Party member of the opposition, spoke, almost launching a personal attack on Eden, saying that in view of the Abyssinian incident, the Far East incident, and the Spanish incident, Eden should be held responsible for the decline in the authority of the League of Nations. As for the government’s constant talk of cooperation with France to defend its policies, it is also quite strange. “If former French Tiger Prime Minister Clemenceau were still alive today, he would never allow Germany and Italy to occupy the Mediterranean islands, thereby cutting off France’s transportation with Africa. Now France seems to have awakened, but we British have not yet.” Finally, Lloyd George asked Eden to provide assurance to Parliament that if the government intends to recognize the Spanish rebels as belligerents, it must first seek the opinion of Parliament before doing so. Eden replied that this could not be done, as everything depends on international decisions. After Eden spoke, several other members of Parliament spoke, and finally the House of Commons decided to adjourn the meeting and reconvene on October 21.

<h3>French Government Rectifies Finances</h3>
<p>Releases Important Orders</p>
<p>[Paris] Finance Minister Bonnet recently gave a speech to the newspapers, saying that the government has now drafted two important legislative decrees, which will be promulgated tomorrow.

The funds needed above will be raised by issuing public bonds. He also said that the forward prices of the French franc exchange rate have improved significantly in recent days, the market price of domestic public bonds has risen, and the number of people subscribing to treasury bills has also increased. All of this proves that the government's request for the people to work together for financial soundness has been understood and accepted by the people.

He urged the Mandates Commission to immediately submit for discussion the plan proposed by the United Kingdom to divide Palestine into a Jewish state and an Arab state. Then, the Commission held a closed-door meeting and decided to request that the United Kingdom provide supplementary explanations for this plan. (30th Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Geneva] When the League of Nations Trustee Committee held its first meeting today, British Colonial Secretary Ormsby-Gore attended and announced that the British government had not yet studied in detail the plan to divide Palestine contained in the committee's report. The British government supported this proposal, and now a boundary commission should be organized to formulate a practical plan. According to the committee's proposal, negotiations should still be held with Jewish and Arab people who are willing to negotiate, and a practical plan should be agreed upon to be submitted to the Trustee Committee, prepare a referendum, draft treaties and auxiliary financial and military agreements, and the trustee system for various parts of Palestine should be changed, and the British government will still be responsible for the trusteeship. Proceed with everything. Ormsby-Gore concluded by saying that it would be foolish to say that this matter is easy to carry out, but from the British government's point of view, all difficulties can be overcome. The British government intends to proceed in this direction, which is the best way to break the deadlock. (30th Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>German Birth Rate</h3>
<p>[Paris] Dr. Burgdörfer, a German statistics expert, gave a speech at the International Population Statistics Conference here, mentioning the German government's policies on birth rates. He stated that the total number of births in Germany was 2,000,000 in 1900, decreasing to 971,000 in 1933, but has since increased, reaching 1,200,000 in 1936. This is the result of the policies implemented by the National Socialist Party government. Germany's population increase policy has often been criticized, but if Germany wants to maintain its current total population, the total number of births must be at least 1,400,000 per year. Dr. Burgdörfer also stated that the increase in Germany's birth rate is not only due to the increase in the number of marriages, but also because of the increased desire for children, and the improvement in economic conditions is the fundamental reason for the increase in the birth rate.

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>On the National Defense Line (18)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Shu Di</p>
<p>The target audience of the "Advocate for Justice Corps" is too broad. The contents are here. They cannot be described in detail one by one. For now, let's take "assisting in reporting traitors" as an example. According to their definition of the term "traitor," it is: "Anyone who colludes with foreigners and harms our country is a traitor, commonly known as a traitor to the nation." Regarding the specific methods of assisting in reporting such traitors, they have established three items: ㊀ In terms of propaganda, county and village corps should, within ten days after the opening of local primary schools, or when the "Justice Corps" holds "mass mobilization campaigns," jointly hold "parades and demonstrations to eliminate traitors" with local primary schools, post slogans, and shout slogans such as "Down with traitors." ㊁ In terms of advising and warning, for those suspected of being traitors, the county and village corps headquarters should send people to advise them or directly warn them. For those who are traitors in other places, the county and village corps headquarters should instruct their family members and relatives to write letters urging them to repent. The letters should be sent by the corps headquarters. If they cannot write, the corps headquarters will write for them. ㊂ In terms of formal assistance in reporting, if the neighborhood and village leaders do not report traitors in the streets and villages, the corps members should report to the village corps headquarters, which will notify the street and village leaders, assistant reporters, or handle the matter. If the matter is not handled or reported within seven days, the "County Corps Headquarters" will notify the relevant administrative district chief to handle the matter or report it. If the matter is still not handled or reported, the county corps leader will contact the county magistrate to handle it and report it to the general corps headquarters for verification.</p>
<p>The "Advocate for Justice Corps" does not have actual executive power; however, its vast scale of supervising politics and controlling society is enormous. No other public organization anywhere can compare to it. Therefore, some people say that it is actually the organization that took over and replaced the power of the Shanxi Party Headquarters after it was abolished.</p>
<p>Fourth, what is "good" and "bad"? What is "justice"?—These are originally very abstract concepts. To understand the meaning of the "Advocate for Justice Corps," we can only understand it from its background, its organization, its mission and tasks, and the targets of its work. However, what outsiders find most puzzling and suspicious about it are still the locations of these abstract concepts. Although the reporter tried his best to visit and investigate in Shanxi, the result is that I still cannot come to a concrete conclusion; however, one thing I can already determine is that these are, after all, metaphysical concepts; there is no concrete content.</p>
<p>I will reveal some of what I have found here.</p>
<p>The general slogan of the "Advocate for Justice Corps" is: "Advocate for Justice"; broken down, there are two slogans: one is "Support good officials, good gentry, and good people," and the other is "Sanction bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people." The Shanxi authorities once said: "The Advocate for Justice Corps is to unite good people into a group to sanction bad people." According to their meaning, it is enough to meet the conditions of being a member of the "Justice Corps," which is what the Shanxi authorities call "good people"; conversely, it is "bad people." So, what are the conditions for being a member of the "Justice Corps"? According to what they have stipulated, apart from the age limit not being able to be used as a distinction of quality, there are only two conditions: ㊀ "Able to advocate for justice," ㊁ Without specific behaviors: (A) Embezzlement and bribery, (B) Smoking opium, (C) Having been criminally punished, (D) Disobedient and unfilial. The so-called "able to advocate for justice" means being able to "stand up for injustice in society." According to the Shanxi authorities, the so-called "injustice in society" roughly includes ten items: (A) "Officials do not advocate for justice, protecting the powerful and wronging the powerless." (B) "Officials are corrupt and accept bribes." (C) "Officials have no sense of responsibility and are not enthusiastic about doing things for the people to promote benefits and eliminate abuses, resulting in the inability to promote benefits and eliminate abuses in society." (D) "Officials collude with bad gentry and local bullies, reversing right and wrong." (E) "Officials do not severely punish bad people, causing good people to suffer." (F) "Officials act arbitrarily, causing the people to suffer injustice." (G) "The family members and relatives of high officials and big gentry are unreasonable in local matters, and the family members and relatives of small officials and small gentry are also unreasonable in local matters, all bullying the people." (H) "Bad gentry, local bullies, and wealthy people do not pay taxes on their land and even resist apportionment." (I) "Large households bully small households." (J) "Bad officials and bad gentry take the opportunity to squander county funds, and bad village chiefs and deputies take the opportunity to squander village funds." Not long ago, it seems that two new items were added: (A) "Violating the regulations on banning opium and drugs" (B) "Promoting communism and collaborating with the enemy as a traitor." However, some opinions believe that in addition to the above two conditions, two more conditions should be added: (A) "Having a profession and being diligent in one's profession" (B) "Not gambling."</p>
<p>I once talked to a person in charge in Shanxi about such things: "Being able to stand up for injustice according to the twelve items of 'injustice in society' that you have listed, that action should be considered 'advocating for justice,' right?"</p>
<p>"There are many injustices in society, not necessarily limited to the twelve items listed; mainly, we should have a fair heart and judge the fairness of things at any time and in any place."</p>
<p>I also asked: "If there is a person who has a profession and is diligent in his profession, is able to advocate for justice, does not gamble, and also does not have one of the five specific behaviors, then that is considered a 'good person,' right?"</p>
<p>"In general, he can be considered a 'good person.'" He nodded. "However, the so-called specific behaviors are not limited to the five items listed; mainly, he should have the habits of a 'good person.'"</p>
<p>So, the problem falls back on the two points of "fair heart" and "habits." My attempt to summarize and obtain the specific content of the two terms "justice" and "good person" faltered again here.</p>
<p>Soon, I left Shanxi, and what I gained was only this much.</p>

<h3>North China Daily News Praises the 38th Division for Not Collaborating with the Enemy</h3>
<p>All Officers and Soldiers of the Division Do Not Forget to Defend the Country; The Courageous Deeds of the Tongxian Troops Will Forever Remain in History.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News stated that the situation in Tianjin seems to be under control, but many lives have been lost and property has been greatly damaged. The Japanese government does not seem to be particularly moved by the actions of its representatives. A recent commentary in a certain Japanese newspaper seems to be surprised by the sudden intervention of the 38th Division, commanded by Tianjin Mayor Zhang Zizhong, in the Japanese military actions. This surprise is understandable because the Japanese have always regarded Zhang Zizhong as a representative recognized by Japanese officials. Zhang Zizhong has now moved to Beiping to begin organizing or restoring a new system of governance that obeys Japanese command. Zhang Zizhong has obviously failed to instill the policies he relies on to preserve his position into all the officers and soldiers of his division. In other words, this part of the division has not forgotten that they are Chinese soldiers and have the responsibility to defend the country and resist aggression. The Tongxian troops, with this spirit, refused the Japanese officers' request to disarm and were bombarded by Japanese planes, resulting in a position where the lack of military equipment was not important. However, their courageous achievements in representing Chinese sovereignty and resisting forever have remained in history. Other troops of the 38th Division also do not recognize the benefits of the Japanese favor enjoyed by their leader and show a tendency to rather seize the Japanese position than be with them. They have expressed their will and are willing to accept disadvantages, even at the cost of their lives. However, they have also drawn the attention of the general public to the ideas they hold, which are very similar to the sentiments expressed in Chairman Chiang's recent declaration. The situation in the north may be being arranged, but the events that have disrupted the overall situation have produced appetites that are not entirely suitable for the Japanese to follow their old tricks and expect as they must have expected. The Japanese aggression may feel that it has spread resentment and will eventually be known to all for the consequences that this action will have. Tokyo may address its military authorities stationed in Tianjin with sharp words regarding this intricate problem of miscalculation.</p>
<p>The Authorities' Attitude is Firm in Resistance</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported from Nanjing on the 30th that people in Nanjing, both Chinese and foreign, were saddened and angered by the Japanese army's bombing of Tianjin, especially its focus on destroying universities and schools. However, as far as the senior officials of the central government are concerned, their attitude seems to have become more resolute due to the recent atrocities of the Japanese army. Chairman Chiang's strong and determined remarks on Thursday night have made it clear that there is little hope for peace negotiations in the future. The Chinese military authorities, of course, do not want to tell people the details of their military plans, but what the interviewer can be satisfied with is that Nanjing is now actively preparing for what is regarded here as a battle of life and death between the two countries. A certain senior official told the interviewer that once the war starts, there will be no such thing as a front post. We know deeply how to resist. When we strike, we will strike hard.</p>
<h3>All Chinese Employees Hired by Japanese Residents in Shantou Resign</h3>
<p>Japanese Consul Asks City Government to Order Chinese Employees Not to Strike; And Falsely Claims That Japanese Residents Are Returning Home to Avoid the Summer Heat</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The situation here is more serious than a few days ago. There are only about a hundred Japanese residents left in Shantou. The exchange trade between China and Japan, as well as passenger and cargo transportation, have all been suspended. The Shantou Taiwan Bank has stopped allowing Chinese depositors to withdraw money from their accounts and stopped doing exchange business between China and Japan since the 26th. Since the Shantou Japanese Bank is the only one, the economic relations between Chaozhou and Shantou have been interrupted. Chinese merchants who have deposits in the Taiwan Bank are unwilling to suffer losses and have jointly submitted a request to the city government to negotiate with the Japanese consulate to find a way to withdraw the money. However, it is reported that the important books of the bank have been moved to other places. If they want to withdraw their deposits, they have to wait until normal diplomatic relations are restored before they can withdraw them. In addition, about 1,000 Chinese personnel are employed in Japanese commercial firms, factories, and residences in Shantou. All these Chinese employees have voluntarily resigned since the 26th. As of the 29th, there are no Chinese workers in any Japanese shops, factories, or residences. The Japanese residents in Shantou have to cook, buy vegetables, and wash clothes themselves. No one can be hired. Yamazaki, the Japanese consul stationed in Shantou, visited Mayor Huang at noon on the 29th, stating that when Japanese ships arrive in Shantou, no one is available to load or unload passengers and cargo, when Japanese people leave the country, no one is available to carry luggage, no boats or vehicles can be hired, and when Japanese people live, no Chinese workers are available. He asked the city government to order the Chinese workers not to strike. If there is anything, we can discuss it at length. Mayor Huang replied that this is a manifestation of the Chinese people's fervent patriotism. They are unwilling to work and unwilling to earn money. The government cannot bear the responsibility of oppressing the workers. It only hopes to do its best to persuade them to resume work to quell the disputes. Mayor Huang also asked Yamazaki in return what the intention was of the Japanese residents leaving Shantou in recent days. Yamazaki replied that it has been hot in recent days, and the climate is often above ten degrees. Japanese residents are returning home to avoid the summer heat. At that time, they both understood each other, and then they shook hands and parted.</p>
<p>It has been found that the Japanese ships passing through Shantou from Hong Kong to Taiwan in recent days are full of Japanese people going to Taiwan, about four to five hundred people per ship. There are no empty seats in the first and second class cabins. As for the Chinese who go to Taiwan for business, when they depart from Shantou, they must have a guarantee from the Japanese stores of the Taiwan Association. After arriving in Keelung, they must have the seal of the local store before they can enter the country. The interrogation is extremely strict. In addition, recently, the Japanese consulate in Shantou has accommodated a large number of Taiwanese people and Japanese residents, so large pots are set up in the grass field in the consulate to cook food. It is said that those who are accommodated are prepared for use when necessary. (Evening of the 29th)</p>
<h3>Jasmine Flowers in Minhou are in Full Bloom</h3>
<p>Harvesting Flowers for Ten Days is Worth a Million; Flower Farmers are Happily Elated</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Farmers in Minhou County grow jasmine flowers, which bloom three times every year in spring and summer, commonly known as the first bloom, second bloom, and third bloom. Each harvest period lasts about ten days. The farmers sell their harvest to tea shops for the purpose of scenting tea leaves to enhance their fragrance. The price of this jasmine ranges from dozens to over a hundred yuan per hundred catties. In recent years, Changle County has also grown jasmine, but the fragrance produced is not as good as that of Minhou. Taiwan also grows jasmine, but its fragrance is even inferior to that of Changle. At the beginning of this summer, there was a lot of rain, and the streams rose six or seven times, so the jasmine in various villages, those in high places were drenched by the rain, and those in low places were submerged by the water. Therefore, the production of the first bloom was very small, and the selling price reached more than three hundred yuan per hundred catties. Recently, the jasmine in various places has been exposed to sunny and hot weather, and after the water receded, the soil has become more fertile. After the flower farmers sorted it out, the production of the second bloom suddenly became very prosperous. In the past ten days, it has been possible to produce about a thousand loads per day, especially in the past three days, the production has reached more than four thousand loads. Therefore, the selling price has dropped from more than sixty yuan per load to more than thirty yuan per load. Major tea shops have purchased more than ten thousand yuan worth of jasmine in these ten days, with some purchasing up to tens of thousands of yuan per day. In total, the flower farmers in various villages have earned more than ten thousand yuan per day in these ten days. Farmers after the disaster have been compensated for their losses, and all are happily elated. (July 30th)</p>

<h3>Wu Zhu Family of Taicang Solely Funds the Construction of a Bridge</h3>
<p>Shaxi Town, which belongs to the county, is the most prosperous market in the county. There is a Zhongshi Bridge in the center of the town, which is an important passage for north-south traffic. However, it has been in disrepair for many years and is gradually collapsing. Now, Wu Zhu, the female owner of the Wanhexiang store in the town, is solely funding the reconstruction. All the materials used have been transported, and construction will begin soon.</p>
<h3>Changshu Organizes Anti-Enemy Support Association</h3>
<p>The Anti-Enemy Support Association of this county has appointed Shi Minyong, Zhang Jiesun, Pang Diancai, Chen Yuchu, Chen Fu, and Hu Shuibo as standing committee members. The first meeting was held yesterday, and it was decided to start work immediately, organize a secretariat, and set up nine departments: propaganda, technology, supply, food, protection, intelligence, transportation, finance, and fundraising. The directors and deputy directors were appointed on the spot, and a citizens' assembly was scheduled to be held next Saturday morning. In addition, there were discussions on preventing traitorous activities, accommodating vagrants, and collecting old copper and scrap iron, and detailed measures were formulated.

<h3>Wuxi Arrests Six Traitors</h3>
<p>Long Tiyao, the county magistrate and commander of the 6th Security Brigade of this county, in order to prevent traitorous activities, strictly ordered his subordinates to pay attention to arresting them. At about 7:00 p.m. on the 30th, the soldiers of the second company of the brigade, while patrolling the railway near Wangting, saw a man about thirty years old wandering around and behaving suspiciously. They went forward to interrogate him, but he stuttered and denied everything. They found a Japanese copper coin and a small silk bag on him. They immediately took him to the team for temporary custody. At about 5:00 p.m. on the 31st, Deputy Officer Yan opened a court to interrogate him. According to his confession, his name is Yang Quanbao, from Henan, and he is engaged in destroying railways and spying on military intelligence. He is paid 20 yuan per month, which is paid in two installments. After obtaining the confession, Yan immediately transferred the suspect to the county government for interrogation, as the suspect was indeed a traitor. At the same time, the team also found three suspected traitors, including Ye Xiaosanz, on the railway near Wangting. In addition, the police station also found two suspected traitors, Hui Mou and Ni Asheng, on the 31st. They are currently under investigation.

The military police joint inspection office has sent teams to patrol and arrested six people, including Wei Guangfa, in recent days.</p>
<h3>Hefei Huainan Road Will Be Extended</h3>
<p>Various public organizations in Shouxian County believe that the cultural relics and terrain of the county are of great importance, but inconvenient transportation has led to a surplus of agricultural products and a decline in commerce. They have repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry of Railways and the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau to build a branch line from Bengbu to Shou, but due to various reasons, it has not been realized. Now, various public organizations believe that the Huainan Road is very close to the county (the northern terminus, Tianjia'an, is 90 li from Shou). If the Huainan Road is extended from Tianjia'an to Shouxian County, it will be easy to do, and the funds will be more abundant since the road was changed to commercial operation on July 1st. Therefore, they specially appointed Xu Zhengxin, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, and Sun Youcheng, chairman of the Red Cross Society, as representatives to meet with Director Hu and General Manager Cheng of the Huainan Road Bureau at Jiulonggang to apply for the extension of the Huainan Road from Tianjia'an to Shouxian County. Director Hu agreed to send personnel to investigate and measure in the near future. If there are no major projects, he decided to extend the road to Zhengyangguan to facilitate transportation in Shouxian County and western Anhui and eastern Henan. The two representatives, Xu and Sun, have returned satisfied, and it is reported that the survey and measurement personnel will be sent out to work soon.</p>

<h3>Well-Known Bandit of Changzhou Apprehended in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chen Qi, the captain of the detective team of Wujin County, previously received a secret order from the county government to apprehend a well-known bandit named Zhou Quanliang (also known as Ai Quanlin). He immediately sent detective Zhang Yuanxin and others to Shanghai to investigate and arrest him according to the address. He soon learned that the bandit had changed his name to Shen Quanliang and was hiding in the Wang Fuyuan Tea House. He immediately brought back the informant Yang Da and, together with two detectives from the Gordon Road police station, went to the tea house and arrested Zhou Quanliang. After being interrogated by the special district court, Zhou hesitated to answer questions about the cases of coming to Changzhou with Tan Xianglin to commit robberies. Detective Zhang Yuanxin immediately returned to Changzhou and reported to the county government for verification. The county magistrate believed that Zhou Quanliang was indeed a famous bandit and immediately prepared a document together with the case file and ordered Captain Chen to go to Shanghai yesterday to submit it to the First Special District Court and escort the bandit back to Changzhou for trial.</p>

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Notice to All Industries: Prevent the Enemy from Obtaining Grain, Forage, and Metals</h3>
<p>Prohibit Grain Transactions from Northeastern Ports. Flour Industry Strives to Store and Expand Warehouses</p>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Notice</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce, in order to prevent the enemy from obtaining grain, forage, and metals, yesterday issued a notice to all industry associations, stating: "Regarding the letter from the United Association of Citizens of the First Special District of this city, stating that the violent Japanese, in preparation for military supplies for invasion, have been using Chinese traitors and Japanese ruffians in various parts of our country for several months to collect and store grain, forage, and scrap metal, which is then trafficked for export for military use. If measures are not taken quickly to stop this, national defense will be further threatened. After discussion by the Fourth Executive Committee of this chamber, it was unanimously decided that this city, as a commercial port with a mixture of good and bad, is most likely to experience such incidents. Therefore, it was resolved to request the City Chamber of Commerce to instruct the various industry associations to strictly prevent any military supplies or raw materials related to national defense from being smuggled out of the country, in order to strengthen national defense. We hereby forward the resolution and request that you examine and implement it accordingly." Upon receipt, we found that although the government has already issued strict prohibitions on the export of metals, grain, and other related items, and has imposed restrictions, we are still concerned that evildoers may smuggle them out, and that even the most meticulous measures cannot prevent oversights. Therefore, we hereby issue this notice, urging all associations, for the sake of consolidating national defense and ensuring their own survival, to assist in supervision at all times and in all places, and to immediately report any observations or information truthfully. This is our sincere hope. We issue this special notice and wish you peace."</p>
<p>Grain Industry Resolution</p>
<p>The Grain and Oilseed Cake Association of this city, recognizing the current national crisis and in order to prevent fellow traders from transporting grain to aid the enemy, and to raise funds for national salvation to contribute to the country, held a joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members at 4:00 PM yesterday at the association's office on Min'guo Road. Gu Xinyi, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Cai Yukun, Yan Xiaoquan, and all other executive and supervisory members attended. Gu Xinyi presided, and Kong Rulin recorded the minutes. The following key resolutions were made: Fundraising plan for national salvation: (Resolution) Divide into two types: national salvation donations and national salvation savings. Regarding national salvation donations, the association will send letters to its eight affiliated organizations, urging all firms and individuals to donate as much as possible.

The committee will consist of fifteen members: Chen Shide, He Quansheng, He Xianggao, Chen Yuming, Gu Xinyi, Cai Yukun, Zhu Zixiang, Chen Ziyi, Yan Xiaoquan, Yang Heqing, Ye Tingfan, She Bingwen, Chuan Changyu, Jiang Hongbin, and Zhou Zhigang. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.</p>
<p>Expanding Flour Warehouses</p>
<p>The various flour mills in this city, in view of the country's difficulties, and since the government authorities have issued orders prohibiting the export of wheat, the grain industry should collectively take responsibility to store national food supplies for the people, in preparation for a long-term resistance. In the past month, in addition to striving to promote production, they have temporarily suspended export transactions from various ports in North China. According to information obtained by the reporter of the Shiye She from relevant sources yesterday, the various mills in this city, including Fuxin, Shenda, and Maoxin, have separately expanded their warehouses and are storing large quantities of flour as much as possible. They are generally refusing to fulfill orders for excessive amounts of spot goods from domestic and foreign trading firms, or any suspicious transactions. Small transactions, however, will be handled as usual.</p>
<p>Preventing Export of Scrap Iron</p>
<p>The Ironware Industry Association, the Scrap Metal Industry Association, the Ironware Parts Industry Association, the Foundry Industry Association, and the Blacksmith Industry Association of this city, in view of the recent outbreak of war in North China and the rise of traitors in this city who are secretly transporting scrap iron to aid the enemy, convened a joint meeting some time ago to discuss countermeasures. A decision was made and submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for implementation. It is now known that these associations have scheduled a second joint meeting for 2:00 PM on August 2nd, and have already issued a notice yesterday.</p>
<h3>Customs Implements Ministry Order Prohibiting Export of Pig Iron, etc.</h3>

The two notices from the Jianghai Customs are recorded below.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Ironware Export</p>

<h3>Shanghai Cultural Circle National Salvation Association Held First Council Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Elected Pan Gongzhan and others as Standing Directors. Issued a declaration on the current situation to encourage public morale. Pan said that the cultural circle should bear its responsibilities.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cultural Circle National Salvation Association held its first council meeting yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM at the Yijia Chun Restaurant. Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a lengthy speech on the current situation and the responsibilities that the cultural circle should bear. Afterwards, standing directors were elected and key proposals were discussed. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Council Members Present</p>
<p>Including Pan Gongzhan, Wang Fuquan, Qian Junrui, Wang Yunwu, Zhang Dingfu, Ye Yifeng, Zhang Tianyi, Xu Huaisha, Zhou Hanmei, Hu Ziying, Ma Chonggan, Ouyang Yuqian, Sheng Cheng, He Liangyuan, Tao Yuande, Lu Shaoping, Shen Qiyu, Fan Zhongyun, Cui Liuyi, Jin Zeren, Xu Gongmei, Cai Chusheng, Li Liewen, Mao Dun, Tao Boxun, Song Zhizhuo, You Jing, A Ying, Hu Yuzhi, Zhang Zhirang, Shen Zijiu, Gu Zhizhong, Shen Tiancui, Yao Xinyao, Zeng Xubai, Zhou Jianbin, Tao Baichuan, Wu Kaixian, Yao Sufeng, Wu Han, Jin Zhonghua, Qian Yishi, Zhu Qinglai, Ying Yunwei, Gu Jiwu, Guan Lu, Chen Kecheng, Sun Zuji, Sa Kongliao, Lu Lihua, Ba Jin, Yan Esheng, and Zhang Zhixue, totaling over fifty people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>Chairman Pan Gongzhan's speech briefly stated that the first council meeting of the Cultural Circle National Salvation Association is being held today at a time when the current situation is tense, which makes its significance even more important. In recent days, the general public may not have a deep understanding of the current situation, which has led to a feeling of anger on the one hand, and a sense of disappointment on the other. I believe that the gentlemen in the cultural circle have a clear understanding of the current situation and will not have this phenomenon. We must know that this war of resistance is actually a decisive battle for the life and death of the Chinese nation. It will not be a short-term event or something that can be concluded with one or two contacts. Now that the war of resistance has begun, it will definitely advance day by day. This does not necessarily refer to the advancement of the military's position, but rather to the advancement of the spirit and facts of the war of resistance. Because our country is being invaded and is forced to rise up to fight back. Chairman Chiang has instructed that we will never give in halfway. Gentlemen, seeing Chairman Chiang's speech today, and Chairman Chiang's report at the Gengshan Talks, it is clear that Chairman Chiang's attitude is resolute, and we really have no room for hesitation. In the past two days, the general public has been greatly disturbed and full of doubts when they heard the news of the sudden loss of Peiping and Tianjin. On the other hand, after receiving news of a small victory at the Ji'hao Bridge the day before yesterday, they were overjoyed and set off firecrackers. This is also a kind of impetuous mentality. Superficiality is definitely not enough to cope with a prolonged war. We, the advanced members of the cultural circle, must take responsibility for correcting this. The central government has already made a decision, but some people still doubt whether the central government is determined and ask why a full-scale war of resistance has not been launched. This is of course not surprising, because they simply do not understand war. War is a major national event, a major event for military experts. How can non-experts in strategy understand all the strategic plans of war? Since everyone does not understand the subtleties of military planning, they should not make irresponsible remarks about military affairs. This is more than just carrying coals to Newcastle. It must be known that this is a prolonged war, not a local war, and it is a war of resistance by a weak country that is forced to defend its life against a strong country, not a war between strong countries. It is possible that one day, a large piece of Chinese land will be lost, and half of our compatriots may even suffer tragic sacrifices. But this does not mean that we will stop fighting if we retreat, or surrender if we are defeated. We must have the determination to continue the war of resistance. At the final moment, not fighting is also a national demise. Fighting can still find a way to survive in the face of death. Therefore, once the war starts,</p>
<p>There is no possibility of peaceful coexistence or hope for peace. Since the central government has made a decision, we must not have doubts about military affairs. We must have absolute faith in the leader and the government. As long as the leader and the government are leading us in the war of resistance, whatever the leader and the government want us to do, we must go all out and sacrifice. Therefore, the current issue is whether we can believe in and obey the leader and the government. If, at this critical moment, ordinary people who do not understand military affairs are still doubting and making irresponsible remarks, they will definitely harm the country. I hope that the gentlemen in the cultural circle will first lead the people to absolutely believe in the leader and the government. First, we can learn from a recent mistake that the lack of unified spirit and will cannot be used to wage war. The defeat of the Twenty-ninth Army is glorious on the one hand, and painful on the other. The reason for the defeat is the incurable disease of "lack of unified spirit and will." The enemy used a divisive policy, trying every day to divide the Twenty-ninth Army from the central government, and then divide the internal parts of the Twenty-ninth Army. As a result, the senior cadres of the Twenty-ninth Army lacked unified spirit and will, and their actions could not be unified. Some wanted peace, others advocated war, indecisive, and waiting to die. If the will was unified and the spirit was unified, they would not have waited until the enemy had fully deployed before fighting back. Chairman Chiang had foreseen this. Now some people vaguely say that we want to resist, but at the same time, we want freedom of thought. Then, the likes of Yin Rugeng, Jiang Chaozong, and Qi Bianyuan, who want to be traitors, are they not also exercising freedom of thought? It must be known that under the firm war of resistance of the whole country, thought cannot be free. If everyone wants freedom of thought, then can a general still command the battle? Therefore, I hope that the gentlemen in the cultural circle will have a great awakening and abandon the individualistic principle of freedom of thought, and unify the spirit of the entire nation. Under this situation, if we do not have a great awakening, we will definitely plant the seeds of national subjugation. Under the lack of unified spirit and will, the Twenty-ninth Army has already made tragic sacrifices, and Peiping and Tianjin have been lost. Now it all depends on whether our entire nation can achieve the unity of national spirit and the unity of will, which can determine the future destiny of the country. Germany's final defeat in the European War was also due to the lack of unity of national spirit. In General Ludendorff's book "Total War," it is described in detail. I hope that people in the cultural circle will use our mouths and our pens to awaken the general public and let them know the value of unified national spirit and will, otherwise it will be tantamount to suicide and self-destruction. Third, the process of completing the great cause of the Chinese national rejuvenation must be learned from Turkey. Westerners used to say that Turkey was the sick man of the Near East, and we were the sick man of the Far East. But Turkey is now rejuvenated. Turkey participated in the European War and was one of the defeated countries. The Turkish capital, Constantinople, had already fallen under the iron heel of the enemy. After the European War, not only the capital but even half of the country's land was occupied by others. However, the Turkish Youth National Party rose up to oppose the humiliating peace treaty signed by the Constantinople government. They absolutely believed in a leader, General Kemal, and moved the capital to Angora in the interior. Within a few years, they commanded the army to counterattack, defeated the Greek army, and even Britain and France did not dare to move. At the First Lausanne Conference, Turkey sent Prime Minister Ismet to attend as a representative. He put forward basic conditions such as abolishing unequal treaties and withdrawing foreign troops. Britain did not agree, and the Turkish representative returned to the country to fight again. The Greek army was defeated, and the peace conference was reopened. Britain, France, and other countries agreed to Turkey's demands, and Turkey was rejuvenated and became an independent, equal, and free country. This was entirely due to several years of hard struggle.</p>
<p>Unified Spirit</p>
<p>As a result, the Chinese people must also have this determination. Even if our land and people have sacrificed an unknown amount, as long as a part of the land and population continues to resist, and does not yield for a long time, the final victory will ultimately belong to us. If we shout for resistance on the one hand, and plan to escape or reduce sacrifices on the other, it is tantamount to advocating war and wanting peace at the same time, and it is inevitable that the country will be subjugated and surrendered. We must now inspect the compatriots across the country to see if everyone has the determination to die, and if everyone has a unified belief. If everyone has the determination to die and a unified belief, we will definitely win. Therefore, China must learn from Turkey and persevere, not surrender, not compromise, not be discouraged, not be arrogant, and be united as a whole, absolutely believing in Chairman Chiang as the commander-in-chief of the unified war of resistance, and always obey his orders. China will definitely be able to rejuvenate.</p>

<h3>Regarding the Case of Speculation in Cotton Yarn, Sheng Enyi and Wu Qiding Will Not Be Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Believed to be Mere Rumors and Gossip, Insufficient as Evidence of Criminal Offense</p>
<p>Sheng Enyi and Wu Qiding, who were investigated by the court due to the speculation in cotton yarn, have now been decided by the prosecutor of the First Special District Court not to be prosecuted. The original text of the decision of non-prosecution is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Decision of Non-Prosecution by the Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court. Defendant: Sheng Enyi, male, 30 years old, native of Wujin, Jiangsu, Director of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, residing at 516 Long'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>Wu Qiding, male, 46 years old, native of Cixi, Zhejiang, Director of the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, residing at 52 Masnan Road.</p>
<p>Regarding the aforementioned defendants, the case of suspected dereliction of duty No. 19 of the 25th year of the Republic of China has been fully investigated. It is deemed that they should not be prosecuted. The reasons are specifically stated as follows:</p>
<p>In May of the 26th year of the Republic of China, the price of cotton yarn at the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange soared. At the end of the month, there was a wave of speculation. On June 8th and 9th, the market was in chaos due to the sharp increase in prices, resulting in the suspension of auctions and market closures. Subsequently, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, together with representatives of the Central Party Headquarters and the Control Yuan, came to conduct a thorough investigation and believed that there were public officials colluding to manipulate and profit. The current public officials, such as the defendants, were suspected of violating Article 134 of the Criminal Law and Articles 49 and 52 of the Exchange Law. The Ministry of Industry submitted a letter to this court, along with a list of evidence, requesting transfer to the court. After careful investigation, the suspicion of the defendants committing crimes is insufficient, and they should not be prosecuted according to law. The following is a separate explanation:</p>
<p>㊀ Wu Qiding's Part</p>
<p>When the Ministry of Industry inspected the relevant account books of brokers and firms, it was found in the client ledger of Yuanda Securities Firm under the name "Yuanji Jia" that there were words such as "Dai Xinghua representing Wu Qiding." It is evident that Wu Qiding has a considerable relationship with the name "Yuanji Jia." Although the witness Dai Xinghua testified that "Yuanji Jia" is his personal account name, and the manager of Yuanda Firm, Yang Yuankai, also said that he added Wu Qiding's name under Dai Xinghua's to facilitate investigation, the statements of these witnesses either contradict the records or are contrary to reason. They are suspected of deliberately exonerating the defendant and are not sufficient to be adopted. However, Yuanda Firm is a broker of the securities exchange, and the name "Yuanji Jia" is recorded in the securities client ledger. Dai Xinghua and Yang Yuankai stated that "Yuanji Jia" is the account name for buying and selling securities and submitted a notice of Yuanji Jia buying and selling government bonds as evidence (see the investigation record and attached documents No. 2), which is still credible. Even if "Yuanji Jia" is the account name of the defendant Wu Qiding, the transactions are limited to securities and not cotton yarn trading. At most, it would only raise the question of whether Article 49 of the Exchange Law has been violated and whether an administrative fine should be imposed, which is obviously irrelevant to the cotton yarn exchange speculation. When the prosecutor, accompanied by an accountant, investigated bills at various banks, no facts unfavorable to the defendant were found. In addition, there is no other evidence sufficient to determine that the defendant directly or indirectly spread rumors or used tricks to intentionally change the market price of the exchange. The suspicion of committing a crime is obviously insufficient.</p>
<p>㊁ Sheng Enyi's Part</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry stated that the defendant Sheng Enyi is an important figure in the cotton yarn exchange speculation, based solely on the fact that such rumors were circulating in the market. Witnesses Mu Xiangyue, Wang Xiaolai, and Yu Qiaqing also stated in court that there were such rumors. These witnesses are all respected figures in society, and their words should be credible. It is evident that there were indeed such rumors in the market, and they are not fabricated. However, according to rumors and hearsay, the evidentiary power is inherently weak, and it is insufficient as a basis for determining criminal suspicion. Moreover, after inquiring from witnesses Mu Xiangyue and others about which broker Sheng Enyi entrusted to conduct transactions and the amount of transactions, and who the rumor spreaders were, except for Mu Xiangyue who said it was said by Xian Lanting, who then denied it in court, the witnesses could not clearly point out the details. Although witness Yu Qiaqing stated that there were rumors of a secret organization called the Seven Star Company manipulating the exchange market, and Sheng Enyi seemed to be related to the company, when asked who organized the Seven Star Company, what its contents were, and what Sheng Enyi's relationship with the company was, Yu Qiaqing said that the Seven Star Company was a recently rumored term, and he did not know who organized it or other details. He also said that because it was rumored that Sheng Enyi was a large bull trader, he presumed that he was related to the company. Furthermore, witness Shao Wenmei stated in the investigation that it was rumored that broker No. 27 was trading on behalf of the Sheng family, and broker No. 57 was also likely involved. When the Ministry of Industry sent personnel to investigate on July 4th, Wang Suizhi, the manager of Yuan Mao Yong, stated that it was rumored in the market that brokers No. 27, No. 57, No. 15, and No. 35 had all traded on behalf of the Sheng family. After examining the client transaction account books and client settlement account books of the aforementioned brokers, there were no records of Sheng Enyi or his regular trade name (Shuzhe Hall). The prosecutor, accompanied by accountant Li Ding, went to local Chinese and foreign banks to separately check the sources of the bills delivered by brokers who were suspected of trading cotton yarn on behalf of Sheng Enyi, as recorded in the exchange's bill receipt books for April, May, and before June 8th of this year, and the results were all unrelated to Sheng Enyi (see accountant Li Ding's report). Moreover, the clients Sheng Ying Ji and Hui Ji of broker No. 27 were account names used by Miss Sheng Wu, and the receipts and payments were directly negotiated with Miss Sheng Wu. The account names Jinru Ji, Ai Ji, Yuru Ji, Kangjin Ji, and Jin Ji of broker No. 57 were account names used by Miss Sheng Qi and her husband, Zhuang Jin. Broker Chen Kangshan of No. 27 and Sun Yufeng, the representative of broker No. 57, respectively stated this (see the Ministry of Industry's record of questioning broker Chen Kangshan of No. 27 and Sun Yufeng, the representative of broker No. 57, and the investigation record). Although Miss Sheng Wu and Miss Sheng Qi are both sisters of Sheng Enyi, they have both been married for many years, and their trading activities cannot be said to be related to Sheng Enyi. As for the fact that the Englishman Anderson entrusted Dong Ransun, the manager of Chengda Firm, to conduct transactions, Chen Yu, a counselor of the Ministry of Industry, and Yan Shenyu, a director, and Kuang Yunwen, a section chief, investigated separately on June 19th and July 6th. Anderson claimed that he bought 11,500 bales on June 8th, which he did himself and had not done cotton yarn trading before. Dong Zaisun stated during the investigation by the Social Bureau that the 300,000 yuan of margin received by Yu Da on June 9th was advanced by Chengda, and that Anderson had cooperated with Miss Sheng Wu on June 8th to trade 10,000 bales. This does not entirely match the check submitted by Anderson to the Ministry of Industry on July 6th, which was paid by the Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Bank. Although there are doubts in this, it has not been found that the defendant falsely used Anderson's name to privately trade cotton yarn. Moreover, the prosecutor, accompanied by accountant Li Ding, went to the Hongkou Branch of the Shanghai Bank to check the checks paid by the bank as recorded in the exchange's bill receipt books for April, May, and before June 8th of this year. The check was not issued by the defendant and was not inconsistent. It should not be inferred from outsiders. Taking into account the above circumstances, in addition to the so-called rumors and hearsay, there is no evidence to determine that the defendant is suspected of committing a crime. According to the results of the investigation and evidence in the investigation, the defendant's part cannot be considered to have reached the degree that prosecution should be initiated.</p>
<p>In summary, the defendants' suspicion of committing crimes is insufficient. Therefore, in accordance with Article 231, paragraph 10, and Article 234 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the decision of non-prosecution is made as follows:</p>
<p>July 28th, 26th year of the Republic of China, stamped by Song Genshan, Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court.</p>
<p>This copy is certified to be identical to the original, stamped by Han Shuzhi, Clerk of the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, July 30th, 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Students and Women Unanimously Resist the Enemy</h3>
<p>Jinan University Students</p>
<p>The students of National Jinan University held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM to establish a support association for resisting the enemy. More than 200 students attended the meeting. After a three-minute silence for Deputy Commander Tong Linge and Division Commander Zhao Dengyu, who died in battle against the enemy, and the martyred soldiers, the following resolutions were made: ㊀ Request the government to continue sending troops north to resist the war and immediately issue a national mobilization order; ㊁ Issue a declaration, embracing the determination to sacrifice and vowing to be the government's backing; ㊂ Issue a letter to the students of this city, calling for the concentration of efforts; ㊃ Organize the elimination of traitors and bandits, and implement reconnaissance of unscrupulous elements; ㊅ Organize the people, with the organization department engaging in practical organizational work; ㊄ Adopt the organizational outline, and elect Xu Jianhua, Shu Hai, Gao Zongjing, and 14 others as executive members.</p>
<p>Women's League</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Movement League telegraphed Chairman Chiang yesterday, requesting him to command the entire army to recover the lost territory as soon as possible, to save the crisis and comfort the people's hopes. The members of this league are determined to sacrifice everything and vow to be the backing.</p>
<p>Students Studying in Japan</p>
<p>The Anti-Japanese Support Association of Chinese Students Returning from Japan held a preparatory meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. More than 50 people, including Wei Daoguo, attended. Chairman Wang Yankang immediately resolved to recommend Xu Shengsheng, Wang Yankang, Wei Daoguo, Li Zhongcheng, Feng Shujun, Zhang Hai, and others as preparatory committee members. They also sent a telegram to encourage the soldiers at the front to resist to the end and vowed to use the Wangping Street Da Hu Evening News office as a contact point.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Movements</h3>
<p>Chu Minyi took the night train out of Beijing last night and arrived in Shanghai this morning. Fang Zhi took the Beijing-Shanghai train to Shanghai at 1:45 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Japanese Mail Ships Shorten Routes, Carrying as Many Japanese Nationals Home as Possible</h3>
<p>Over Two Hundred Return Today, Kawakawa and Nisshin Steamships Suspend Service</p>
<p>Japanese nationals in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River have been ordered to evacuate completely. Recently, four batches of people have arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru and Nagasaki Maru of the Japanese Mail Company. Japanese nationals from various places are coming to Shanghai. Those who have pre-purchased seats from the Japanese Mail Company are still flocking in. In order to carry as many Japanese nationals in China back home as possible, the company has shortened the routes of the Nagasaki Maru and Shanghai Maru. Starting with the Nagasaki Maru's last return to Shanghai, it will stop sailing to Kobe and will only run the Shanghai-Nagasaki route, in order to shorten the route. A ship will arrive in Shanghai every other day, specifically to carry Japanese nationals back to Japan. Today, the fifth batch of Japanese nationals returning to Japan has more than two hundred people, mostly from the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. It is said that there are already many people who have pre-purchased seats for the sixth repatriation.</p>
<p>After the firing at Lugouqiao, the Nisshin Steamship Company has stopped loading cargo from Chinese merchants onto its ships, and passengers have also stopped taking its ships. Recently, the company's ships are still sailing as usual, only carrying Japanese Confucian scholars from various places along the Yangtze River. The company's Chongqing branch has closed down, and the Chinese staff have been dismissed. The Japanese have already taken the Yiyang Maru to Shanghai, preparing to return home. The Kawakawa in Kawakawa has decided to suspend service. As for the company's Hankou branch, it has not yet received orders to dissolve, so the company's ships on the Yangtze River are still traveling between Shanghai and Hankou as usual.</p>
<h3>Shen Junru and Others Released, Please Release Political Prisoners Again</h3>
<p>Sun Xiaocun and Others Detained for Eight Months, Various Associations Request Release</p>
<p>Sun Xiaocun, Section Chief of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Cao Mengjun, First-Class Clerk of the Industry, Storage, and Agriculture Department, were detained by the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters for participating in the National Salvation Movement six days after Shen Junru and others were detained (November 28th of last year). It has been eight months, and they have not been transferred to the court. Now that Shen Junru and others have regained their freedom, Sun Xiaocun and others have no news. Even their families have not been allowed to meet them. It is now heard that their families and their close friends Chen Gaorong, Chen Zhigao, Lin Xichun, Shi Zhecun, Wu Longmei, etc., have submitted requests to the Central Party Headquarters, the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, and other places for their early release. The Shanghai Editors Association and the Chinese Rural Economic Research Association, considering their significant contributions to cultural work and rural revitalization work, also plan to appeal to the authorities. The former has already recommended Zhang Zhirang, a director of the association, and others to draft a petition to request the authorities to release them. The latter has also sent Feng Hefa and Su Muqiao, directors of the association, and others to Beijing to petition the party and government authorities separately.</p>
<h3>Banks and Money Shops Tighten Lending</h3>
<p>Various Industries Request Accommodation</p>
<p>Shanghai's banks and money shops have made considerable preparations for the financial situation in this extraordinary period. Given the severity of the situation, they have uniformly implemented a tightening of various loans, depending on the circumstances of each bank, with unsecured loans being the most affected.

It is heard that the two associations have sent letters to member banks and shops to handle this.</p>

<h3>Important News from Various Exchanges</h3>
<p>Securities Exchange Plans to Auction Corporate Bonds</p>
<p>In order to circulate funds and develop business, the board of directors of the Chinese Securities Exchange has decided to establish a corporate bond market on the second floor of the exchange to auction various corporate bonds and bonds issued by the Ministry of Railways at home and abroad. It has been two months since preparations began. A reporter from Dagong News specifically interviewed Chen Jisun, the director of general affairs of the exchange. According to him, the Chinese industry has historically had difficulty circulating funds, so it has been difficult to fully develop in business. In recent years, it has become imperative for the funds of various companies to be fully circulated. The exchange originally had this plan, but it was delayed due to capital limitations. Now, the extraordinary shareholders' meeting has resolved to increase a large amount of capital, so it has begun to arrange various market facilities and engage in research on auction rules and regulations. If there are no major changes in the situation, it is expected to be implemented in three days.</p>
<p>Securities Exchange Changes to New Bookkeeping</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange previously changed to new bookkeeping, which was complicated and unfamiliar. In order to practice, the Brokerage Association specifically submitted a request to the board of directors to suspend the market for two days. It is now known that the practice has been completed, and it has been decided that starting this month, all brokers' records of transactions and entries of transaction accounts will uniformly adopt the new bookkeeping format as required by the exchange.</p>
<p>Securities Revises Commission and Margin Regulations</p>
<p>The Chinese Securities Exchange Brokerage Association convened a general meeting of all brokers at 9:00 AM yesterday in the second market of the exchange to revise the industry regulations. Chairman Zhu Dajun first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then discussed the results, which were scheduled to take effect on August 1st. All commissions and margins for accepting client futures trading will be uniformly in accordance with the resolution of the general meeting. The margin will be charged according to the exchange's collection, and the minimum commission must be one-thousandth. The draft will be revised at a scheduled meeting.</p>
<p>Wheat Exchange Opens as Usual Yesterday</p>
<p>The flour exchange opened as usual yesterday. However, with the drastic changes in Tianjin, both parties were less enthusiastic, so there was no excitement. The settlement was still limited.

According to him, the exchange opened as usual, and the rumors were inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Youning Car Company's Small Director Admits to Kidnapping Xue Jiasheng</h3>

<p>Wen Hai, the small director of Youning Automobile Company at the intersection of Shantou Road and Yuqiaqing Road, and Liu Bingkun, a former car driver, were sentenced to life imprisonment by the First Special Court for the Jiangsu Bank branch robbery case. Liu was found not guilty, but the French police found that Ren and others were involved in the kidnapping of Xue Jiasheng on August 1st of last year. They were transferred to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation to determine the truth. A public prosecution was filed on the charge of kidnapping and demanding ransom. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Liao Ying continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. Ren admitted that he and Su Zacai, who is at large, and Chen Jintang, who was convicted, jointly kidnapped and that Ren was responsible for watching the ticket. Liu Bingkun flatly denied participating in or driving the car for the bandits. The court ruled to reschedule the hearing for 9:00 AM on August 11th, pending the review of the files.</p>
<h3>A Hurricane Has Started Again South of the Ryukyu Islands</h3>
<p>If the Direction Does Not Change, Fujian and Zhejiang Will Be Attacked</p>
<p>A hurricane started again yesterday south of the Ryukyu Islands in the Pacific Ocean. At 2:00 PM yesterday, it had reached 23 degrees north latitude and 129 degrees east longitude, within a range of 6 Shanghai miles. The direction is north-northwest. Because the distance is still far, the strength of the wind is unknown. However, if the hurricane continues in this direction, the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang may be attacked again.</p>
<h3>Two Fires in Zhabei Yesterday</h3>
<p>Xiangyan Bridge Road and Song Park Road, a Total of Forty-Four Tiled and Thatched Houses</p>
<p>For unknown reasons, a fire suddenly broke out at the Shengchang egg basket manufacturing factory opened by a Haining native near the Xiangyan Bridge on Xiangyan Bridge Road, which is under the jurisdiction of the Linping Road Police Station in Zhabei, at around 11:00 AM yesterday. Smoke and flames filled the air, and the fire was very fierce. Fortunately, the police officer on duty at the station was informed and reported to the station. He immediately called the fire department and drove a water truck to the scene to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until after 2:00 PM, resulting in the burning of a storeroom of the Unified Silk Factory in the west, as well as ten buildings from No. 51 to No. 61 and from No. 66 to No. 74 on the opposite side, and about twenty thatched sheds and lead-skin houses in the back, for a total of about forty houses, with huge losses. Also, a fire was reported on Song Park Road at around 2:00 PM in the afternoon. Fire trucks from various sections rushed to put out the fire, and a total of four thatched sheds were burned down.

<h3>Eighty-One-Year-Old Woman Accuses Daughter-in-Law of Bullying</h3>
<p>Son and Daughter-in-Law Have Been Separated for More Than Ten Years, Court Rules the Case Inadmissible</p>
<p>Guangdong woman Zheng Guweiying, residing at No. 451 Hong'an Lane, Laobazi Road, is 81 years old. Recently, she filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing her daughter-in-law Zheng Tang Peifang (53 years old, residing at No. 537 Taiping Lane, Wuchang Road) of</p>
<p>Relying on Wealth to Bully</p>
<p>Destroying the Five Relationships, Disrespecting Elders, Abusing Her Husband, Hiding Her Great-Grandson, and Intending to Abandon, etc. The reasons for her lawsuit are briefly stated as follows: The plaintiff married the eldest daughter of Tang Zhiren (Zhongliang), the defendant, as her daughter-in-law in November of the 15th year of Guangxu. They had one son and one daughter. The daughter, Likun, has passed away. The son, Guohong, is alive and has married and had four daughters. Unfortunately, the young great-granddaughter, Minsheng, died in May. She ordered her son, Richang (Pengzhou), to go to the Tang residence at No. 527 Wuchang Road to bring the defendant home. However, the defendant did not recognize her husband and said, "Who are you? I don't know you." Her son went home and told her, but Mrs. Zhao did not believe it. Since the defendant had been married to her husband for more than thirty years and had children and grandchildren, why would she say she didn't know him? She ordered her son to go again, but unexpectedly, he was instigated by the defendant and more than ten male and female servants to beat and drive him away. He reported to the Hongkou Police Station. Later, her son's internal injuries took two months to heal at home. She also said that she had not seen her great-grandson and granddaughter-in-law Mai since her son was beaten more than two months ago. She went to her grandson's residence at No. 10 Taiqing Lane, Fusheng Road, to inquire, but they had already left. It was said that they had been hidden by the defendant, or that they had been harmed. She is old and sick and needs the service of her children and grandchildren. The pain of her only son being injured has not been relieved, and the worry of her great-grandchildren being missing has increased. Therefore, she filed this lawsuit. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Dai Rongduo took the bench in the Fourth Criminal Court to summon the defendant and her lawyer, Lin Qingchi, to the court. The plaintiff, Zheng Guweiying, submitted the case, and because she was old and deaf, her son, Zheng Richang, stated the above situation on her behalf. The defendant stated that after she married the plaintiff's son, their relationship deteriorated. Later, because he owed money and fled, she returned to her mother's house and lived there for more than ten years. She never received a penny of comfort from her husband. On May 18th of this year, her husband went to her mother's house and roared in every possible way, accusing her father of owing him more than 20,000 yuan. She ignored him, and he rolled around on the ground, blew the whistle wildly, tore his clothes, and reported to the police station, accusing her of instigating the beating. In fact, she never instigated the servants to beat her husband. The purpose of this sudden criminal prosecution is because she learned that her father had passed away and thought that she had received a large inheritance, so she wanted to force her to go home so that she could pay for her support. Finally, her defense lawyer stated that most of these cases are private prosecution crimes. Since the plaintiff is not the direct victim, the procedure is inappropriate. Judge Dai reviewed the供词 and ruled in court that the case was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Russian Gatekeepers of the British Bank Fight Each Other</h3>
<p>Suspecting Colleagues of Slandering After Being Suspended, No. 5 Russian Constable Seriously Wounded by Three Shots</p>
<p>The British Bank at No. 18 Bund has always employed two Russian gatekeeper constables, one being No. 3, named Aijing Ni'aisili Jitongke, and the other being No. 5, named Shimensi Tuolizhen. The two had a good relationship on weekdays, but recently, No. 3 was lazy in his work, which often caused him to be scolded by the Western manager, leading him to suspect that No. 5 was stirring up trouble. As a result, they became enemies, and the two often quarreled. At 7:10 AM yesterday, after No. 3 received his pistol from the police station, he went to work, but was informed by the bank that his position had been suspended by the manager. The constable suspected that this was also caused by the slander of Constable No. 5, and he was extremely angry. As he was walking out of the bank, he happened to meet No. 5. Unexpectedly, No. 3 suddenly took out the pistol he had prepared and fired a shot at No. 5, hitting him in the chest. After being shot, No. 5 rushed forward and grabbed No. 3. No. 3 then fired two more shots, one hitting his arm and the other hitting his head. However, although No. 5 was shot in three places, he still struggled to snatch the pistol from No. 3 before falling to the ground. No. 3 then tried to escape. At that time, a special constable, Zhang Haoqing, passed by and followed him. When he reached the Bund on Fuzhou Road, he saw Western Police Chief Hui Tuo coming towards him. Zhang went forward to report and arrested the Constable No. 3 and took him back to the police station. Hua detectives Chuan Jinfu and others sent No. 5 to the public hospital for serious injuries. At 11:00 AM, the police station sent No. 3 to the hospital for treatment. After the doctor's examination, it was found that the injuries were serious, and he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Criminal Court Chief Qian Hongye took the bench to interrogate him. Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer of the police station, stated the previous situation, saying that it was difficult to predict when the injured person would recover, and the defendant had fully confessed in the police station. The case is now requested to be postponed for one week to see how the injured person's injuries are. When questioned, Aijing Ni'aisili Jitongke fully confessed. Judge Qian reviewed the matter and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3>Marital Discord Leads Neighbors to Request Legal Action</h3>
<p>He Qinghua Seeks Pleasure; Peng Shujuan Unwilling to Reconcile</p>
<p>He Qinghua, a native of Ningbo and owner of Ruiluxing Cotton Cloth Store, located at No. 6, Jifuli, Lane 457, Ningbo Road, is 31 years old. He previously married a Ms. Xu, with whom he had two sons. After Ms. Xu passed away from illness, he married Peng Shujuan, a woman from Nantong (23 years old), during the 6th group wedding organized by the municipal government on February 5th of last year. They immediately cohabited in the store. Recently, because He sought pleasure outside their marriage, Ms. Peng repeatedly tried to dissuade him, which angered He. On the evening of July 9th at 9 PM, another conflict arose. He violently beat her, causing injuries. After Ms. Peng had her injuries examined at the First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, she filed a complaint with the Laozha Patrol Room. Detective Sun Dafa transported her to Renji Hospital, where the injuries were confirmed. Furthermore, over twenty businesses in Jifuli, including Yixin, Fuxin, Taijiu, Dacheng, and others, having frequently heard He beating Ms. Peng, jointly submitted a petition to the Prosecutor's Office, requesting that the matter be handled according to the law. The Patrol Room also filed a public prosecution against He. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Fengqi of the First Special Court opened the Second Criminal Court for interrogation. He, accompanied by his defense lawyer Wang Xintang, appeared in court. Ms. Peng also engaged Lawyer Chen to file a supplementary civil suit, seeking repayment of medical expenses and other funds totaling 68 yuan. First, Patrol Room Lawyer Jiang Baolian presented the circumstances, initiating prosecution under Article 277, Item 1 of the Criminal Law, and stated that the defendant claimed at the Patrol Room that Peng had mistreated his late wife's son, leading to the quarrel. Subsequently, Ms. Peng submitted a petition detailing the injuries she sustained. When questioned, He Qinghua admitted to verbal disputes but denied causing any injuries. The court attempted to mediate a reconciliation, but Peng Shujuan stated that the pain she had endured was too great, and she was unwilling to reconcile. After questioning by Judge Zhan, the case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<h3>In Memory of Generals Tong and Zhao and the Martyred Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Bao Lu</p>
<p>"Zhao Dengyu, Commander of the 132nd Division of the 29th Army, and Tong Lingge, Deputy Commander of the 29th Army and Director of the Training Regiment, have had their remains recovered. They were jointly coffined on the 30th, and their coffins are temporarily placed at Longquan Temple. According to Zhao's guard who returned to Beiping, during the intense battle, Commander Zhao was directing operations near Tuanhe when he was suddenly hit by a bullet, injuring his left arm. I wanted to carry him back, but the commander refused and continued to advance. Shortly after, his leg and shoulder were also injured. I urged the commander to retreat, but the commander said to me, 'Return to Beiping as quickly as possible and tell my mother: "Loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fulfilled. If I am unfortunate, please tell my mother not to grieve."' I tried to persuade him, but he refused, so I had no choice but to return to Beiping to report to the Commander's mother at her residence in Xin Temple Hutong, and after that, I did not know any further news. It is also heard that Deputy Commander Tong was on the front line when his legs were shot by machine gun fire. Tong, who was running at the time, fell forward, and a shell hit his head, resulting in his death." (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>"The current situation in Beiping and Tianjin, such a transformation, was anticipated by informed people in the country," but five thousand soldiers and Generals Tong and Zhao died in the disaster. How tragic!</p>
<p>Because of the martyrdom of Generals Tong and Zhao and other soldiers, we cannot help but think of Yue Wu Mu. Commander Zhao said to his guard before his death, “Return to Beiping as quickly as possible and tell my mother: 'Loyalty and filial piety cannot both be fulfilled. If I am unfortunate, please tell my mother not to grieve.'” This is like Yue Wu Mu's tone. Seeing the situation of the Southern Song Dynasty before us, we really do not have time to be moved to tears by General Zhao's tragic death, but also feel sad for ourselves who are still alive!</p>
<p>Yue Wu Mu and his soldiers did not perish at the hands of the Jin soldiers but collapsed at the hands of internal traitors. Everyone still regards this as a regret. Yue Wu Mu's foolish loyalty has now become a regret for informed people. Of course, it is foolish, but his tragic death and his awe-inspiring spirit were enough to shock heaven and earth and make ghosts and gods cry, and will last forever!</p>
<p>Therefore, in terms of Generals Tong and Zhao and other martyred soldiers, they died in the right place and have no regrets. For us who are still alive, we really cannot ignore the traitors of today! This is not only enough for the people of the country to repay Generals Tong and Zhao, but also for our Yue Wu Mu in the future.</p>
<p>The Jin soldiers are about to cross the river, those who are still immersed in the dream of temporary peace, wake up!</p>
<h3>After Bitterness</h3>
<p>— Ma Jia</p>
<p>Really, when you hear the sudden bad news: "Our army has withdrawn from Fengtai"! The Japanese army counterattacked Langfang only yesterday with extreme joy, but in a few hours, it changed so quickly, so quickly that it was almost mysterious. At this time, how can you not lose your mind and rely only on your own feelings, like a thousand unbridled horses galloping, making all kinds of crazy appearances that lose their normal state, crying! Stomping your feet! Sometimes it's even shameful to think about suicide"!</p>
<p>At that time, the four of us young people, after reading the newspaper, were indeed in that kind of crazy state. We all hung our heads low and didn't see each other, and we didn't pay attention to each other for a full twenty minutes. In these twenty minutes, the blood in our bodies boiled like magma before a volcanic eruption. Our eyes were on fire, and we wanted to smash everything in front of us to the ground. Xiao Zhu was the first to do it. In our sorrowful silence, he threw his beloved teacup to the floor. At first, we were startled, but later, when everyone's eyes focused on the shattered teacup, strangely enough, we all felt a very pleasant stream of emotion rushing through our cold hearts. A Huang even gritted his teeth and shouted</p>
<h3>Constipation Harms Health</h3>
<p>We eat three meals a day and must defecate once a day so that the waste in the body is not stored and the blood flows naturally, making us feel more energetic. On the contrary, the residue accumulates in the intestines and often creates toxins, harming our health. If you take one or two "Weilun Run Chang Wan" pills a day, you can achieve natural defecation every day, because the pills are made from plant extracts and refined with their effective ingredients, so the efficacy is guaranteed and there are no drawbacks. Each bottle of 30 pills is priced at 24 cents, distributed by Zhengwei Pharmacy.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>:</p>
<p>"Damn it! Dealing with our enemies, like this teacup shattering, is so simple! But!"</p>
<p>A Huang's throat choked up. I didn't say anything, I just pondered, "Isn't it? Fengtai was recovered all at once, and Langfang was also recovered all at once. Of course, as long as it's all at once, the Japanese army will be completely driven out of North China, that would be so simple! But it just so happens—" I didn't dare to think any further.</p>
<p>I squinted to look at Lao Peng. Lao Peng was much colder than us. He was the same as usual. His face, which had never had any expression, was now flat, like a philosopher, like he was pondering some mysterious and unanswerable thing. His eyes were dully staring at the woodcut on the wall in front of him, and his legs were shaking. I couldn't stand his coldness, and I almost scolded him when I asked him:</p>
<p>"Lao Peng! Do you have any emotions at all?"</p>
<p>Lao Peng only glanced at me casually, and then, as usual, slowly said:</p>
<p>"Ma Jia! To be honest, I am from Hunan. Since I was a child, I have lived an inhuman life. I have traveled through seven or eight provinces. I have tasted almost all the sufferings in the world. How could I not have emotions? It's just that my emotions are often overcome by my reason, and I deeply think about a certain phenomenon in front of me! Ma Jia! To be honest, when I took the newspaper from the vendor, I was a hundred times more upset than you. I saw that you were in a crazy state, and I did shed tears. But now, I am calm."</p>
<p>Xiao Zhu and A Huang both turned around and listened to Lao Peng's heavy words. He is calm now, and we are much calmer too. Seeing Lao Peng's gloomy attitude and hearing his heavy conversation, people will feel half-hearted. Lao Peng looked at us without saying anything. Maybe he saw that we were recovering, but he said heavily, like an old man reprimanding impetuous young people:</p>
<p>"Friends! When there is something that deserves your excitement, you should restrain your emotions; but when there are facts that make us sad, we have to ask Mr. Reason to think about it carefully for us."</p>
<p>Damn it! Isn't he really putting on the face of a senior to reprimand us? I turned my head to look at Xiao Zhu and A Huang, and I saw that their eyes were emitting an expression of disdain to pay attention to Lao Peng's words. I simply wanted to shout directly at him and ask him not to say such senior-like things anymore! But I didn't shout it out after all. How about Xiao Zhu and A Huang? They didn't say anything either. I just felt that Lao Peng's words made a lot of sense. Lao Peng probably caught our weakness, and he said again:</p>
<p>"Friends! Of course, you all know that the problem between China and Japan has reached the stage of settlement today, but this is a great historical process! We have all read history. For example, let's take the world of Wells in the UK. From the time when there were no humans, it is narrated directly to today's human society, with only about a thousand pages. We can read it in half a month, but this is the history of thousands of years! The settlement of the China-Japan problem today may only be a few pages in the historical record, but in our reality, it is definitely not a matter of a day or two!"</p>
<p>What else can we say to refute Lao Peng? Although Lao Peng's expression made us feel a little uncomfortable, his words were not wrong at all. Why should we be so emotional? Extreme happiness, until extreme bitterness. Lao Peng's words are right, the settlement of the China-Japan problem is definitely not a matter of a day or two in our reality!</p>
<p>After a while, we all recovered. We picked up the newspaper that A Huang had kicked to pieces, and we quietly read the newspaper again.</p>
<p>An hour later, A Huang said: "I have to learn about rescue work no matter what. Would I be discouraged by a small setback in our military?"</p>
<p>Xiao Zhu also said that he wanted to go to a friend who was participating in citizen training to ask for help, and he also wanted to go to military training. As for me, of course I want to reread the few journalism books I read before, and of course, I have to find a way to practice on the front line, if possible.</p>
<p>Bitterness is only a temporary emotional effect. After this emotional effect, I believe that there will be no more of that foolishness in the future. This can also be said to be a lesson.</p>

<h3>Launch Our Full-Scale War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Ke Yu</p>
<p>A full-scale war of resistance has begun! This is a decisive battle for the survival of our nation! We should have the following understanding of the full-scale war of resistance:</p>
<p>A full-scale war of resistance is a war of resistance launched by concentrating the manpower, material resources, and financial resources of the entire country.</p>
<p>A full-scale war of resistance is a war of resistance in which there is no distinction between north and south, and no distinction between old and young, and which is carried out quickly.</p>
<p>A full-scale war of resistance is a war of resistance under the consciousness of "determination to sacrifice and resist the enemy to the end."</p>
<p>A full-scale war of resistance is a prolonged and prepared war of resistance.</p>
<p>During the full-scale war of resistance, we should all be tense, always tense, and everywhere tense. We must not have selfish psychology or a lucky mentality. All our people should have a calm and composed spirit to cope with all future events. During this period, our "minds should be calm, measures should be prudent, do not be afraid of things, do not cause things, think about the safety of the overall situation, plan for the interests of the whole people, do not just know the immediate worries, but ignore long-term considerations." During this period, we should "clench our teeth, hold on to our goals, be compassionate and resolute, and all mental and financial resources are elements of revival, and should be cherished and not wasted." — Mayor Yu's words.</p>
<p>A full-scale war of resistance should be launched in all aspects and developed in all aspects:</p>
<p>Ourselves —</p>
<p>㊀ Prepare all the resources and materials to contribute to the country.</p>
<p>㊁ Prepare all the knowledge and skills to be used by the country.</p>
<p>㊂ Enrich our wartime common sense such as air defense and poison prevention.</p>
<p>Everyone —</p>
<p>㊀ Organize comfort teams, rescue teams, and singing teams to go to the front line to give comfort and encouragement to our army.</p>
<p>㊁ Launch a larger patriotic propaganda and fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>㊂ Automatically join the volunteer strongmen's team as the backbone of the full-scale war of resistance.</p>
<p>Government —</p>
<p>㊀ Issue an emergency mobilization order to the national army so that they can go to the front line to kill the enemy at any time.</p>
<p>㊁ Determine our military, political, economic, cultural, and diplomatic policies for the war of resistance.</p>
<p>㊂ Listen to and accept the opinions of the people in the opposition.</p>
<p>㊃ Actively organize the masses and open up the mass patriotic movement, so that the anti-enemy forces throughout the country are more firmly united and widely developed.</p>
<p>Launch our full-scale war of resistance! In the days to come, we should do our best for the country. We are not afraid of any hardships and sacrifices. We have many difficult days ahead, and everyone needs to face them firmly. Today, we only recognize the goal of saving the nation and seeking survival, and we are determined to save ourselves. We will devote all our efforts to defending the nation's war of resistance. We will not say more, but "how to put it into practice"!</p>
