<h3>我軍新陣地工事異常鞏固</h3>
<p>自小南翔經江橋抵梵王渡　蘇州河南岸工事尤爲堅强</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者廿九日晚八時零五分報吿、南翔至蘇州河兩岸之陣綫、已佈置就緒、自小南翔向東南在吳家墳之處、越大塲南翔公路、而至洛陽橋、沿眞如南翔公路之一段、而向西南、越京滬路、經江橋鎭、而以垂直綫向南沿申紀浜之西岸、以達蘇州河北岸之姚家渡、及南岸之姚家宅　互相呼應、並將河流封鎖、復沿蘇州河南岸向東南以達北新涇、再至梵王渡、至南岸沿河之工事、尤爲鞏固、敵連日以飛機大砲轟炸、但絕無損毀、小南翔以北陣地、並無變化、</p>
<p>中央社云、敵軍進佔閘北大塲後、恐中我伏兵、故由中山路交通路西綫西進、一路經大夏大學直撲蘇州河、惟橋樑已斷、不能渡越、另一路則經眞如而抵北岸周家橋鎭、與我軍隔河相持、其西之虬江則仍由我軍扼守、與江橋結成鞏固陣綫、小南翔廣福兩點、仍在我軍堅守、羅店方面、我施相公廟曹王廟之陣地、鞏固異常、惟爲調整防綫計、自動向西略移、前傳已退至登橋鎭、茲悉不確、其北迄瀏河一綫、則沉寂異常、中央社隨軍記者廿九日晚八時零五分報吿、租界以西蘇州河北岸之敵　全日活動、甚形忙碌、上午曹家渡之東北、有敵軍之調動、午後在日華紗廠附近、則有敵便衣隊五十餘人、往來窺探、盤踞大夏大學之一部、則忙於構築工事、在該校屋頂設有觀察所、該校左近、並配置砲位、午後潭子灣方面、並有敵軍汽球升空、窺察我軍陣地、旋卽降落、</p>

<h3>敵軍昨兩次犯小南翔</h3>
<p>經我痛擊敵死傷八百人</p>
<p>中央社云、本社隨軍記二十九日晚十二時報告、我軍退守新陣綫後、敵不斷進犯我小南翔陣地、雙方血戰不下十餘次、但我軍始終扼守該處、昨日淸晨、敵軍在一旅團以上、向我陣地猛撲、經我奮勇抗禦、血戰五小時、將敵擊退、至午後四時半、敵又增援來犯　我卽以猛烈之砲火還擊、並衝鋒肉搏、相持至夜半、總計敵軍死傷已在八百人以上、經此重創後、敵已呈動搖之勢、</p>
<h3>敵砲轟豐田紗廠流彈擊斃英兵</h3>
<p>四人殞命二名受傷　無辜居民死亡尤多</p>
<p>昨日下午、滬西蘇州河北岸盤踞之敵軍、向河南豐田紗廠我軍陣地砲轟不已、該處越界築路區域、如白利南路、極司非而路各處、流彈橫飛、共落下砲彈達十四枚之多、上述區域內、爲英軍駐防地點、至傍晚六時許、砲擊更密、有二彈落于極司非而路蘇州河旁、英兵三人當卽被炸斃、二名受傷、附近居民中彈損命者共八人、另一彈落于愚園路一四七五號內、有英兵一名受重傷、旋卽殞命、華人死者二人、受傷英兵先後送宏恩醫院治療、不日當可治愈、同時兆豐花園附近有男子五人、女子二人被砲彈擊傷、卽送紅十字會醫院療養、</p>

<h3>敵武裝汽艇昨竟駛入蘇州河</h3>
<p>企圖襲擊我軍　但被英軍阻退</p>
<p>敵軍武裝汽艇兩艘、滿載海軍陸戰隊、於昨日下午三時半、由黃浦江駛入蘇州河、圖向西駛去、當經過老閘橋時、爲英軍所阻、雙方相持約二小時、經英美法義各國駐軍高級長官前往交涉、始於五時許退去、當時沿河一帶臨時宣告戒嚴、形勢殊爲緊張、迨解决後十分鐘恢復交通、茲將記者目擊情形、誌錄如下、</p>
<p>武裝駛進蘇州河</p>
<p>敵艇全身作靑灰色、尾懸太陽旗、滿載武裝陸戰隊共約四五十人、並有新聞記者數人、手持攝影機、雜處其中、其時河內停有民船甚多、水道奇窄、兩艇因不能暢行、叱令兩傍船戶讓避、不時以槍恫嚇、迨經老閘橋（福建路）將近老垃圾橋（浙江路）時、爲兩岸及橋上之英駐軍發覺、卽令停航、禁止通過、英軍並伏處防禦物內、以防萬一、當時形勢、異常緊張、巡捕房卽派中西警捕到塲驅散路人、並在兩橋僑堍、設置鐵絲網暫時不准行人通過</p>
<p>經駐軍交涉阻止</p>
<p>敵艇停於河心、相持不去、約四時、英美法義及萬國商團工部局高級長官、相偕前來、卽向其交涉、其時兩岸但見汽東及機器脚踏車在北岸往來甚忙、約半小時、英美等駐軍長官先行離去、卽有警捕等通知民船駛開、讓出航道、至五時許、兩艇始魚貫駛退、當經老閘橋時、並有一人放出信鴿五只、似爲傳遞消息、約十分鐘、卽恢復交通</p>
<p>目的在襲擊我軍</p>
<p>事後、據英國駐軍負責人告記者、日軍已遵令退去、以後想不致再來云、至敵艇此行用意、似在試探租界當局之態度、圖打開此路、以進襲我軍、聞當時敵更强詞爭辯、大意謂蘇州河向由我國管理、現敵軍進佔閘北、故有權行駛該處、後以理缺、但謂未奉長官命令、不能退去、其蠻橫無理、可以想見、惟終以英方態度强硬、故不得已而退去、以後如何、頗堪我人注意也、</p>
<h3>國徽飄展氣壯山河我孤軍四次退敵</h3>
<p>迄今已歷三晝夜達一百小時之久　敵懼我機槍掃射以警犬拖回死屍　壯士高呼中華民國萬歲</p>
<p>我八十八師謝團楊營孤軍八百、昨日仍安然駐於蘇州河北岸光復路之四行倉庫內、以儲藏極少之彈藥、與敵作最後一拚、誓死保守此閘北一塊土、雖敵軍自朝迄暮、不斷進攻、但仍屹然未動、無一壯士傷亡、附近市民自動絕食一天、以節省之粒米、接濟孤軍、慰勞物品、堆積如山、中外人土、紛至瞻仰、隔蘇州河高呼“中華民國萬歲”、鮮明奪目之青天白日滿地紅國旗、飄然於崇樓屋巔、凛然表示不可凌犯之壯氣、誠開歐戰有史以來未有之壯烈紀錄也、</p>
<p>一百小時堅守不退</p>
<p>查此八百忠勇壯士、係於二十六日侯晨一時、在團附謝晋元·營長楊瑞符·率領下、由北火車站原駐地退入該倉庫、迄今歷三晝夜、誓死保守此閘北一塊土、達一百小時之久、中間敵軍用盡方法、企圖驅走我忠勇壯士、卒被我孤軍以神勇之精神擊退、駐防該處之英國軍、多數曾參加歐戰者、以爲歐戰尚無此種忠勇之精神、故曾歡度剴切向我軍勸告、卸去武裝槍彈、退入租界、勿作壯烈犧牲、我軍對英軍垂愛之友意、固甚感激、無如我八百壯士、個個抱定志在以身殉國、情願洒最後一滴血、死守此寶貴之最後陣地、以與日軍一拚、作最光榮之犧牲、故除對英軍表示謝意外、無壯士肯接受逃避之請求、英軍觀此情狀、多亦感動讚嘆、</p>
<p>四次猛攻均遭擊退</p>
<p>昨日上午三時·及七時十分·下午三時四十五分·及五時十分、敵軍曾四次向該倉庫、我軍猛攻、均遭我軍擊退、以下午兩次最爲猛烈、斃敵四十餘人、遺棄蘇州河邊、不敢摃掩、用警犬拖去、茲分述四次情形如下、㊀上午三時及七時十分兩次、每次敵軍祇十餘人、持槍荷彈、由隔壁沿牆邊偷犯、我軍早已發覺、仍佯作不知、迨敵逼近倉庫門首時、卽居高臨下、紛以手溜彈向敵猛擲、敵見勢不佳、咸急遽向西忘命奔逃、當已有多人餘彈斃命矣、㊁下午三時半許、敵以汽艇兩艘、每艘載敵百餘人、上架輕機關槍一尊、人各手持步槍或手溜彈、自黃浦江駛入蘇州河、向四行倉庫進發、當駛過外白渡橋至老垃圾橋堍時、被駐防沿蘇州河浜之英軍發覺、卽堵截前進、以極和靄之言語相勸敵軍、勿得前進、以免危及租界、經兩小時之交涉、始行離開、㊂三時四十五分、新垃圾橋堍一帶、步槍機槍聲大作、手溜彈鋼砲聲間夾、蓋敵軍六十餘人、自上海銀行堆棧第三次來犯矣、我軍於敵逼近時、探首衛外、沉着精神、鼓舞其勇氣、分頭以機槍射掃、並以手溜彈如雨擲下、來犯敵軍、大半中彈倒地、餘被逃逸、倉庫門前、蘇州河邊、遺棄敵屍、不計其數、而敵軍久未敢親來移屍、移時、當見如孩高之警犬數頭、趨前口銜、擬將敵屍拖回、我軍卽以步搶射擊、一犬亦中彈而死、㊃五時十分、敵軍十餘四次來猛衝、經我搖射機槍約二分鐘、來犯之敵卒被擊退、是役斃敵四五人、而我軍則一無傷亡、</p>
<p>國旗飄展氣勢凌雲</p>
<p>記者昨日自晨迄夕、鎭日在長沙路口某高厦登高瞭望、所見情形、眞非一言一語所可盡述、當上午五時許、附近各里弄、均已竚滿民衆、間亦有外籍人士、隔河瞻仰我忠勇壯士、各馬路口之慰勞接濟物品、堆積如山、厦門路垃圾橋堍有卡車十餘輛、其內則滿載麪包糖果水菓等類食物、人叢夾雜之中、且有一外籍婦人、以香烟一紮、自南岸投擲於北岸、惜其標的不凖、均拋入蘇州河內、四行倉庫朝南窗口、有兩幅國旗懸於左右、層樓屋頂則高揭長約六尺闊約四尺之靑天白日滿地紅國旗一面、隨風飄展、在附近數幅敵旗包圍中凛然表示其不可侵犯之壯氣、民衆仰首視之、益顯興奮、對八百壯士忠勇奮發之精神、毅然起敬、紛紛脫其帽向我軍隔河揮帽致敬、我壯士亦憑高高呼“中華民國萬歲”其聲浪亦壯亦烈、此種浩然偉大精神、令人生無限欽佩之感動、</p>
<p>民衆竚立脫帽致敬</p>
<p>自我孤守閘北光復路四行倉庫之八百忠勇將士誓死不退之消息傳佈後、全國振奮世界震驚、而最足令人興奮者、卽昨日晨曦初上、代表我大中華民國之靑天白日之光榮國徽、已巍然堅立於倉庫高屋之巔、臨風招展、倍覺燦爛、外國人仕及我國民衆趕往觀察者、竟日絡繹不絕、虞洽卿路新閘路一帶、途爲之塞、隔河民衆、凡行經該地者、均紛紛脫帽北向面對國旗及忠勇將士致敬禮、當時外國人士、觀此情景、亦均表示深切之同情、記者亦係參加此馬路隆重典禮之一、並親聞得兩西人互語、略謂、以六十年休養生息、號稱東亞一等强國之日本、而與二十年來內戰未停之中國、在淞滬一隅苦戰至七旬以上、祇獲得五英里之進展、已足貽日人之熄今復於萬國觀贍所繫所謂日軍業已佔領之蘇州河畔之閘北、發現高懸中國靑天白日之煇煙國旗　　事以奇趣、孰逾於此、蓋日本在侵華史上已留下一洗滌不凈永遠之汚點矣云云、</p>

<h3>德牒覆比政府不參加九國會議</h3>
<p>藉以避免捲入漩渦　美代表團已抵比京　意國將由外長出席</p>

<p>［柏林］德政府頃已决定拒絕參加九國公約會議、按自比政府邀請德國參加九國公約會議之後、政界人士最初宣稱、德國派代表參加比京會議並無不便之處、然嗣又翻然變計、認爲德國對於中日兩國衝突、以保持中立態度爲佳、蓋德政界人士雖贊成日本之政策、以爲其目的在於阻止布爾希維克主義在遠東之新發展、但德國倘公然袒護日本、則在中國將視爲係一種不友誼之態度、職是之故、德政府頃乃决定不出席九國公約會議、對於中日兩國衝突寗置身事外云、（中央社廿九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>敵機威脅下的政治工作</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>在這次戰爭中間。敵空軍的主要活動區域。多半不在戰地。而在缺乏防空設備的繁盛市鎭。例如松江一城。距離戰區相當遙遠。而連日所遭受的轟炸慘禍。並不稍减於前綫的戰地。單是昨晨一次。敵機投彈就達一百三十餘枚。目標多在熱鬧市廛。及和平市民。這種慘無人道的殘暴行爲。不過使我同胞愈益認淸敵人的本來面目。在軍事上簡直是亳無意義可言的。</p>
<p>雖然如此。我們為了抗戰的前途。對於這等禍難。卻也不能一味聽其自然。我們必須積極努力於事前的防範及事後的救濟。尤須注意於民衆的戰時組織。不使地方秩序因敵機的肆虐而受到絲毫的影響。關於這項努力的具體方針。我現在提出兩點。希望軍政當局及各界領袖予以考慮。</p>
<p>第一。凡是遭受着空襲的區域。軍政當局及民間有識分子應當積極運用保甲制度。務使全體居民無論男女老幼。嚴密地組織起來。能夠自動担任適應戰時需要的一切工作。如防空·掘壕·救護·運輸·肅淸漢奸·生產合作及消費合作等。</p>
<p>第二。政府方面應當趕緊設法。保證遭受戰禍的貧民。能夠繼續維持最低限度的生活。關於這一點。最有效的辦法。除設立收容所外。還有工賑及開關移民區等。</p>

<h3>九國公約會議美國人負之責任</h3>
<p>— 孔宋藹齡</p>
<p>財長孔祥熙夫人宋藹齡女士、昨晨在金陵廣播電台廣播演說、對行將在比京開會之九國公約會議、頗多建議、措辭嚴正、茲特譯述如下、</p>
<p>諸位聽衆們早安、我此刻在中國上海演講、借此機會、能與諸位談話、並祝福諸位、這是很愉快的、因為美國像我弟二故鄕、我就學於貴邦、貴邦人士、我熟識渴念者很多、除私人友誼以外、貴國亦是與我國遺風相同的友邦、貴國深知日本對華武力侵略、其兇惡危險、毀滅人性、非但危及我國的生存、並且威脅世界的和平、</p>
<p>在上次世界大戰以後、世人以為將來世界的和平、可締結條約及公約、以保障其安全、我國的和平、因九國公約的締結、更加安全、好像有了堅固的窗戶、盜賊難以入屋、但是雖有堅固的窗戶、假如警察解除武裝或注意稍懈、盜賊就要施穿窬之技了、國家亦然、各大國因陷於世界不景氣、無暇外顧、日本就乘此時機、施其技倆、因為上次世界大戰、日本受損最少、他旁觀其餘各國多數國力日减、於是因利順便、傾其全力、以整軍經武、並竭力增加其工業生產、以奪取世界市塲、暗中竭力儲備的軍器多至不可勝計、於是用以侵略中國的土地、</p>
<p>在世界多事的時際、日本已打定了主意、發了一筆大財在中國的大陸、他又打定主意、擴充更大的帝國、他眞是一個國際大盜、行險儌倖、冒天下之大不韙、以奪取其意想中之贓物、這些事、他都願意幹、因為他自信、萬一各國因為他蹂躪國際條約而拔刀相助的時候、他就準備與之周旋、自九一八奪取滿洲以後、各國未曾阻止、他更有恃無恐、毫無忌憚、</p>
<p>九國公約所給予我國的保障、完全給日本毀滅、於是他更進一步、欲以吏兇暴之手段、以達其目的、所以在我國國土內大量的毀滅生命與財產、他覺的國際間的警察、並不能阻止國際間大盜的行為、</p>
<p>但是、日本此番忽碰到了意外的遭遇、彼所夢想不到者、即中國抗戰、並且是從來所未有的抗戰、智勇兼備的抗戰、在這次抗戰中國已表露兩種事實、第一、中國並不懦怯、第二種事實更為重要、即日本並不是百戰百勝、我們雖然受挫、但是從前世界的一種錯覺、已為之一掃無遺了、現在列强均可撫躬自問曰、“我們何必再恐懼不前、不敢强制各國尊重條約、以保全人類的生存乎、”實則此種恐懼心理、本應不必存在、假如世界仍懷此恐懼之心理、則世界前途、實甚黑暗、</p>
<p>說到此處、諸位必將問我、如何能達到和平、我說諸位能做的和平工柞很多、欲求和平、須有從事于和平工作的勇氣、否則諸位雖大聲疾呼曰和平、曰中立、曰孤立、而戰神或不擇日而突然光臨了、</p>
<p>然則諸位如何能援助中國阻止日本侵略、並按照九國公約的條件以維持遠東之和平乎、我以為貴國不須加人戰爭、我們並不要求貴國加入我們打仗、除參戰之外、貴國能帮助我們有效的方法很多、貴國對我國的同情與精神上的援助、我們都感謝不忘、但是我們尚有需要貴國帮忙的地方、就是在可能範圍以內、願貴國再加物質上的援助、假如貴國不願、即無異助日本以滅我國、我們需要軍器軍火、我們要救濟條約所不能保護的數百萬無家可歸的婦孺和數萬的傷兵及平民、同時我們希望貴國與我們合作、不供給金錢與日本、以免其延長侵略的時間、貴國國民祇要不同日本做賣買、所有軍器軍火和戰爭有間接關係的貨物、貴國概不運往日本、以免其延長戰禍殘殺中闕愛好和平的平民、</p>
<p>我們以為無論日本如何頑强、亦决不能戰勝全世界的公理、眞的自從上海開戰以來、不是已經十一個星期了麼、我們早知道他們是不過爾爾的、諸位是否知道我國的軍隊、是不會預備的、兵器的實質、是陳舊的、然而在這十一個星期中、我們的軍隊却以血肉、去敵對這配有最新式軍器的日本軍隊、抵抗他們殘忍的屠戮、在血和肉尚能抵禦的時候、我們始終並未停止、諸位就可知道假使世界上各强國果然要逼迫日本放棄他的黷武政策、其實是極容易的、</p>
<p>諸位大概也知道世界各國最近將在比京不魯塞開會、促九國公約方面覓一個解决中日局勢的和平方策吧、所以現在正是極好的時候、請問貴國對于這會的熊度如何、而將來與我國支待這九國公約採用　如何步驟、日本已經欺騙過世界各國、現在他又在行使他的欺騙手段了、在他侵略中國東三省的時候、當時不是他說過沒有要過中國的土堆嗎、然而現在他正在侵略中國的本部了、在東三省他設立一個偽政府、現在他又忙着在華北及內蒙古設立另一個偽政府、管理華北一帶地方了、無論日本怎樣的宣傳偽政府是獨立的、但是他的軍隊和顧問、在偽政府裹却是有無上的威權、請問貴國及其他各國、是否可以容他欺騙而不能爽直的指摘嗎、</p>
<p>我們人民對於九國公約會議中貴國所取的態度、極為關心、因為貴國可以世界上的一切、貴國究竟將取積極的手段、尊重絛約、或者是免去是非而取一種模棱的政策乎、我們對此却非常的焦慮、因為日本侵略東三省的時候、已經證明了國聯是有名無實的、以致世界上發生無數的變化、而中國恐怕又將被犧牲了．無數弱小民族、對於這國聯的尊嚴、難免又要失望了、並且這許多弱小民族對於貴國極憂慮的注視着、因為他們缺乏領導者、又因為他們等着望着這世界，是否可以遵守將來一切的條約、所有遵守條約的人、現在正在疑盧和平的日子、是否一去不復再來咧、大家目光中以為貴國定是弱者和被壓迫者的仗義執言者、並且可以想像他勇敢無敵的維持和不與施行條釣、不能任一民族受威脅屠殺於另一民族、即如今日中國受日本之殘暴行為比京會議可以使絛約恢復尊嚴、然而同時亦可以使條約等於廢紙、和平可有保陣、亦可更受摧殘、列强皆有莫大的責任、而世界文化是否犧性、以及今日廣播聲中所說日本在中國的流血慘劇、是否將來在他國再有繼續的可能性、均在此次會議的掌握之中、</p>
<p>我人的理想、以為貴國在今日的地位、除與列强努力合作、採取同一簡捷步驟、使以後永不發生此種野蠻時代不宜而戰的事例外、似乎不應有其他政策、我人又以為貴國必能使各民族有遵守條約的信仰心、並且必能以堅强勇敢的熊度、領導各國、使中國現在所受的痛苦、永不再見、現在必須實行、纔能有效、决非徒作空言、所可卸責、我人旣不能以聰明自欺、亦不能以聰明欺人、我人必須有勇氣、尤其要誠實、此次比京會議、假使貴國及其他各强國不採取一種堅决手段、則該會議在世界歷史上將來不免為世界政治家最無意識的會議、而世界人類的和平、人道與民治主義、將永不再見矣、</p>

<h3>戰區雜寫（一）</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>“到前綫去不比在上海，你們要聽我的話：司機的注意聯絡，但不准亂開雷燈；瞭望的注意飛機，並當心車上東西失落。誰滑頭，誰就對不住自己的爺娘！”一位押運大批軍用品，行將重返前綫的前副官，掃射着光亮的手電燈，很乾脆的對着環立在他旁邊汽車夫說·</p>
<p>“這是國家大事，我們當然絕不會滑頭的！”對方異口同聲地這樣對答，有幾個還挺胸擧手，顯示出他們分外的興奮·</p>
<p>“嘟嘟嘟的幾聲，這隊滿載軍用品的卡車，便浩浩蕩蕩，奔赴前綫去·記者的車，也伴行其中·另有一位和我搭車的副官陳紹武君，據說：他是由內地開來的某勁旅的一員，昨晚到上海添購電綫，正苦深夜無處問津，洽遇一個電話局的工友，欣然願以嚮導自任，東奔西走，替他辦妥此事·今天他又在辣斐德路商店買拍紙簿，不料老關是位高鼻樑藍眼睛的外國人，問明他是‘打洋兵的，’便在瓜瓜呌的生澀的恭維語之下，出乎意外的贈他幾件慰勞品。</p>
<p>陳君從前聽得上海是最勢利最欺生的地方，但此刻他却處處碰到同情的人，甚且連外國人也會給他種不可磨滅的鼓勵，眞使他萬分的高興·</p>
<p>他又說：他們在出發之前，曾通統打過思想上的血清針，換句話說，就是平時患有恐日病的，或對抗戰意義模糊不清的，為防“一粒老鼠屎，汚了一鍋湯”的流弊，都早令他滾蛋了。現開前綫來作戰的，都一致抱着“不復失地，誓不生還”的决心。前天他們剛增防某地，當有一營敢死隊，不顧重大犧牲，硬把朱家宅對要陣地奪回來，就是這種純潔旺盛的士氣，小試其鋒的表演了。</p>
<p>記者從他的口音，聽出他是某省人，那裏有句“空手出門，買財歸家”的流行語，在一般征人的腦海中，是非常活躍的；但現在該部遠來征倭的健兒，竟一變而抱“不復失地，誓不生還”的决心，這不能不說也是“最後勝利必屬於我”的一個保證。</p>
<p>陳君中途作別，記者讅視外景，頓覺前次所經的危險地：前面有敵我軍衝鋒機槍掃射聲、後面復有我震天價響的隆隆砲聲，相隔沒有三天，砲聲巳遠移於前，毫無疑義，這是我們反攻勝利了。然而我們知道“持久抗戰”的里程，是很長遠的，不是隨便打幾仗，就可以打到頭，所以我們對此一類的小勝利，不但不驕，也許意料中的小失敗，接踵而至，我們遠更應該鼓起勇氣，和敵人死拼到底，如此最後最大的成功，始能得到把握的呵！</p>
<p>途中軍運頻繁，車行很費時間、駛到XX方面的某地，已是深夜了。那時霧露濃郁，大地芒芒似海。黃副官走過一道哨兵綫，打電話給某軍部副官主任盧先生約記者天亮相見。那裏有許多同志和伕役，眞怕凍壞了他們的老大哥黃副官，好像蠣蟻抬食，即將堆集如山的軍用品片刻的功夫，都卸下車來。</p>
<p>看時間，天不久就要亮了，决在車上坐以待旦，但不知不覺間已疲倦入夢。一會兒忽被强烈的電光，把我驚醒，原來在那裏照料傷兵的童子軍，怕敵機馬上就來“點卵”勸我們應乘黑夜把車隱蔽好，童軍夜有的還用口琴吹着義勇軍進行曲，當此月斜露潤的秋農，聞此激昂悲壯的歌聲，心裏眞有一種說不出的心情！</p>
<p>第二天的早飯，承盧主任招待，同席諸君，漫談戰事逸聞如下：</p>
<p>瀏河一綫的敵軍，因四次上岸，都被我軍迎面痛擊，使他們立脚不住，便紛紛跳入水晶宮去了！同時，敵海軍砲的射程，祇能打十三四公里，而我們最新式的重砲射程，超出敵砲射程，這實是威脅敵艦的一大制命傷。不過我們的砲手，非常愛惜砲彈，每發必須瞄了又瞄，眞要百發百中，然後才捨得轟然射去。所以敵軍近來不敢再窺瀏河，這就是呌他們“談虎色變”的理由了。</p>
<p>當戰爭爆發的前夕，我最高軍事領袖，對敵我軍傷亡率的預測，曾有　初戰時與“　之比”之說，但以瀏河死傷實情論，敵軍龐大的死傷率少亦必三倍於我。又我方在瀏河口的守軍，常見滿裝屍匣的敵船，不斷輸運出口，自蕰藻浜劇戰開始後，所見尤多。統計自八一三開戰後所運出的屍匣，至少當在五萬以上。而且此種屍灰、乃係千屍萬骨，集體焚化，後又分置少數之匣內，以運回遮人眼目，故死亡確數尚不止此。</p>
<p>敵軍師出無名，屢戰不利，畏死心理，便日甚一日。士兵如識淺薄，迷信千人縫，或佩小佛像，妄求不死，固勿論巳。但他們前次進攻雜店的軍官，居然也有携帶光怪陸離，神話運篇的護身旗的、眞不怕令世界人士看了，深感到他們所謂光榮尊嚴的皇軍，不過是些“牛鬼蛇神”之類呀！（未完）</p>

<h3>八百孤軍沉着應戰今晨二次却敵</h3>
<p>謝團長呈孫師長馮副師長函　謂未達任務前决不輕易犧牲</p>
<p>我雄據蘇州河北岸光復路口四行倉庫內之第八十八師謝團楊營忠勇壯士、迄今已達四日四夜、雖敵軍盡其所能、用盡毒計、終不能損我壯士纖微毫髮、更無論我堡壘矣、今晨拂曉起、卽有無數中外人士前往瞻仰、新閘路帶途為之塞、記者亦於清晨到逹、隔岸遙矚、但見四行庫頂上與大陸倉庫頂上我靑天白日國旗雙雙招展、倍覺燦爛、而我八百餘壯士、咸安處庫房、態度自若、四週工事、更見堅固、河之南岸以及新垃圾橋上、且有十餘外籍軍官憑攔觀望、敵軍則蹙處西端上銀行倉庫內、且有十餘敵兵隱伏敵工事內、頻以散漫之步槍子彈、向我四行倉庫射擊、但我軍沉着不理、敵乃繼以機槍盒子槍向我挑釁、斯持始見我一二壯士、推啟憑河之窗戶作一度偵視、并靜觀敵軍之變、然敵果未察也、在上午十一時許、敵兵十餘、突自其工事內匐伏而出、似欲乘機偷襲、不意早被我臨窗壯士所見、待敵舉步、卽以步槍射擊、方及數發、敵卽倉皇奔逃、避入其工事內、亟以機槍向我亂射、一若惟恐被我追擊者、一種慌張失態神情、令人發噱、未幾又見先前之十餘敵兵盡脫兵衣、日頻頻以巾拭汗、大約渠等經此表演、已累得滿身臭汗矣、嗣後敵兵卽隱匿不出、竟以步槍向南岸遙望者所站點射來、若欲以洩羞憤者、結果幸未被中、</p>
<p>手溜彈擊敵退戰車</p>
<p>敵軍以數次向四行倉庫衝鋒、均告失敗、且被我軍擊斃者甚多、昨日下午、敵不敢再進、乃以坦克車數輛、從所置沙袋後緩緩前進、孤守庫棧之我軍、佯作不見、待坦克車進至相當距離之內、突以手溜彈數十枚、集中猛轟、敵見勢不佳、狼狽而遁、今日上午、敵叉更變策略、以所置四行倉庫西面之沙袋、遞次漸漸向東移近、伏居沙袋後之敵軍、卽以一種用步槍射擊之小炸彈、集中倉庫牆璧轟、果被擊破一洞、但我英勇之孤軍、卽以該洞為架設樓關槍之用、一陣猛烈還擊後、敵立匿居沙袋後、不敢出動、惟漫無目標以步槍射擊耳、</p>
<p>敵軍拂曉進攻潰退</p>
<p>自今晨拂曉起敵軍集中火力、向我英勇孤軍進攻、一時槍聲殊為緊密、但我軍鎮靜異常、待敵逼近、卽以機關槍、手溜彈猛烈還擊、敵逃避不及、紛紛中彈倒地者十餘人、共餘敵軍亦狼狽退至交通銀行堆棧分據屋頂還擊、直至七時許、敵我雙方機關槍·來福槍聲、仍在相互射擊中、惟我軍槍彈由高而下、時中敵軍要害、</p>
<p>再度進襲仍未得逞</p>
<p>自七時許、敵軍漸呈不支、遂變更戰略、一面由烏鎮路側面進襲我軍背面、詎尚未近我軍駐所、卽又中機開槍彈倒地、敵軍見勢不逞、乃停止進攻、至此槍聲始漸稀少、嗣於八時許、有敵機二架、突飛至烏鎭路一帶上空盤旋、三分鐘後、卽行向東逃去、十一時許槍聲再作、我孤軍仍沉着應戰、敵軍中彈斃命者達十餘人、</p>
<p>敵架鋼砲圖轟倉庫</p>
<p>今日上午六時起、敵軍在國慶路方面架設小鋼飽數門、準備轟擊四行倉庫、但該地房屋建築、悉屬鋼骨水泥、且四週更由我軍堆置沙袋、故敵軍此項舉動、决不致於我英勇孤軍有何影響也、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>關於九國公約會議。蘇聯政府報加以評論云。為制止非法的罪惡的冒險擊動。。而召集會議。旣失之拙劣。且無用處。反之。直接關係各國。誠能出以共同行動。於事已足。這確是一針見血的快論。我對於近日九國公約會議前的種種情形。已深深地令人失望。九國公約會議。本想二十五日舉行。後又改為三十日。又改十一月三日。時局的嚴重性。已到火燒眉睫之勢。而他們故意迁週曲折。遲遲舉行。此可失望者一。未曾開會之先。各國又聲明態度。我說是精神上加援。他說是道德上加以譴責。又有說當用和平的方法。斡旋遠東之糾紛。深恐得罪了瘋狂的戰神。將自己招來彌天大禍之概。此種畏首畏尾的神情。可决其必無善良的效果。此可失望者二。并且試看近年來各式各樣的會義。是那一個收到了意想不到的效力。</p>

<h3>前方與後方（三）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>“那末，實際發動民衆的問題，正是朝野各方所焦慮着的。在這工作剛要開始的第一步，有些人所担心的，却是領導權的問題。這不能不說是前途的暗礁”。——我。</p>
<p>“領導權，我以爲不應該成爲问題的”！陳先生興奮着。“這是全中華民族生死存亡是危險极了；不幸萬一軍事失的最後關頭！照目前局面，眞敗，上層的，是敵人的統治；下層，就是大批的漢奸。此外，就是茍安着的人羣。再除此而外，什麽也沒有了！那時，試問還有什麽領導權！還有什麽可以領導的！”</p>
<p>“事實確係如此。不過我說的，也是各方承認的實際情况。目前的緊急問題，在於：怎麽樣使廣大民衆切實發動起來！”——我。</p>
<p>“我以爲，民衆應該本身發動起來的！似乎用不着先問什麽人來領導！”—陳先生。</p>
<p>“對了。目前，一切理論的探討，已經足够了；最須要的，就是切切實實的做。這做法，要有效果；而且，要爲各方所接受所放心。據我們得到的消息，各方面，對這種做法的行動綱領，在籌思着的，已經不在少數了。——我。</p>
<p>“不過，無論什麽做法，想收宏大的效果，祇有和民衆生活打成一片，才可達到。雖然，有些人也許因此疑心；而事實呢，不使愛國家，愛民族的觀念，和他們切身利害觀念統一的話，那末，民衆是不會發動起來的。”—陳先生。</p>
<p>注意聽著的，在座的一位先生，這時，就從深思裹振作了一下，他把衣領整了一整，點著頭說：“一點也不錯！一點也不錯！這是陳先生過去長期工作經驗得來的結論！</p>
<p>談話到這時，已經有了一個多中頭。嚴肅的空氣，稍微鬆弛了一下。我們就問到陳先生的健康。</p>
<p>“很好！很好！”陳先生笑著答；而那精神飽滿的面色，也和他至話，一同答覆了我們的問題。</p>
<p>又問到行動上是否受限制之類的話。他立刻聲稱著：</p>
<p>“一切都很自由。這方面是沒有什麽的。”</p>
<p>陳先生和我們報裹去的三位同人，輪流地各照了幾張像。分手時，他一再地叮嚀著：</p>
<p>“今天的談話———今天的談話———。”那無限的關心，我們很敏銳地感到了。</p>
<p>陳先生大概是不願意在他的談話被發表出來的時候，有被誤記爲違背目前全中國無形中接受了的各種最高原則约吧。——這感想，和訪問其他名人以後一樣的，又於這時，浮上了我的心頭。</p>

<h3>蘇聯的靑年（一）</h3>
<p>— 劉育才</p>
<p>蘇維埃聯邦政府對於靑年訓練，特別是注重少年學生，是用一種政治敎育去敎育他們的，所以從十歲到十六歲的少年男女，都組織一種靑年團體，接受靑年黨的指導，這種靑年團體的人數，現在有四百萬人以上。他們有所謂五箴五律的規例，來敎訓他們做人。</p>
<p>這當中所謂五箴的規例，是，</p>
<p>㊀守着一切健康的行動，有着寬大的快樂；遵守早起習慣，做着體操。</p>
<p>㊁節約時問，敏捷行事。</p>
<p>㊂要勤，勉，忍耐，常常遵守着集團的行動。無論任何場合，自己應當有着應付的方針。</p>
<p>㊃保持每個人的財產：對於自己的書籍，衣服，作業地方應當看得很要緊，</p>
<p>㊄絕口不罵人，愼戒飲酒吸烟。</p>
<p>這是對於蘇俄靑年敎育的一種旨趣，却也是一種很有趣味的組織。</p>
<p>另外還有一種少年團體，是十四歲以上的人的組織；那裹面的團員，也有五百萬人以上。</p>
<p>這兩種靑年少年團體，還負有一些社會的使命。比如他們在乘電車的時候，便做着取締無票乘車人與檢査車票的工作。或者有的時候，跑到農村去，監督着農民的播種與收穫。列寗曾經把這種團體，指定爲蘇俄的海軍保護團體，其後又指定他們是蘇俄空軍的保護者。</p>
<p>蘇俄的首腦人物，在本國靑年黨的指導上特別是倡導着愛國運動。在二年前五月。靑年黨倡導着人生最高法律的時候，那所謂愛國心，懷愛故鄕的精神，在一般爲政者與新聞雜誌上面，竟掀起了很大的熱烈議論。更趁着蘇俄的北冰洋探險船柴爾斯基號遭難的這一件事，來鼓起人民對於救助運動的熱心，而開始着激烈的愛國運動</p>
<p>這種愛國運動的倡導，所謂愛護蘇俄的愛國者，對於他們的祖國，言語以及人民，都有着互愛的精神，同時各人發揮着自己的才能，爲國家共成大事。凡是與蘇俄有所不利的行動，他們都在竭力的避免，根據這種主張，所以在上者便捉牢着種種機會來養成一般國民的愛國心。值得令人注意的事情，是他們在努力做着許多關於柴爾斯基號救濟運動的發音片，與體育運動競賽時的發音片，利用這種東西給人民以興奮刺激，都不外乎是想借這些機會來養成人民的愛國心。</p>
<p>他們獎勵的方法是給予各種勳章，徽章與稱號，其中以“蘇俄的英雄”的這種稱號，爲最高貴的名譽賞，這是二年前四月才制定的獎勵方法。至於體育運動方面的獎勵，是“功勞運動家”的稱號爲最佳，這些稱號的勳章徽章，都是爲着酬答這般愛國者而後狀勵的。</p>

<h3>Failed Attempt to Cross Zhoujia Bridge; Enemy Attacked Southward Along Zhenbei Road and Was Repelled</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting at Huangxia Residence; Our Troops Charged Out of Trenches and Inflicted Heavy Casualties on the Enemy. We Continue to Defend Xiaonanxiang; Enemy Attacks Were Unsuccessful. Enemy Shelling of Toyota Mill; Stray Bullets Killed Four British Soldiers.</p>
<p>The focus of the Shanghai battle has shifted westward. For the past two days, the enemy has been continuously bombing the northern bank of the Suzhou River, including Beixinjing, Huacao Town, and the area from Qiujiang West to Jiangqiao and Xiaonanxiang, with airplanes and heavy artillery. In the areas of Fanwangdu and Zhoujia Bridge, the two armies are confronting each other across the river, and the fighting is fierce. At 7 PM the night before, the enemy launched an attack from the Great China University, assaulting our Zhoujia Bridge. Both sides exchanged heavy artillery fire. By late evening at 11 PM, about four to five hundred enemy soldiers attempted to cross the river in the area of Zhongshan Road. Our troops immediately countered with machine gun fire, the bullets as dense as rain. The enemy found no opportunity to exploit and quietly retreated. Yesterday, the two sides exchanged fire across the river all day, the sound of gunfire and artillery clearly audible. The enemy's attempts to cross the river stealthily are unlikely to succeed. As for the enemy in the Zhenru area, they attacked southward along Zhenbei Road, holding positions at Panjia Residence, Jijia Warehouse, Qijia Village, and other locations on the north bank, confronting us. Our troops also formed a line on the north bank, with their backs to the river, occupying Huangjia Residence to the west of Zhenbei Road and Majia Residence, Xiajia Residence, Jinjia Residence, and other locations to the east of Zhenbei Road, constructing solid defensive positions. At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy advanced with two regiments. We launched three fierce counterattacks, killing over a hundred enemy soldiers and routing them. The enemy and we are currently still in a standoff, with a distance of less than one thousand meters between us. The enemy on the Zhongshan Road side, starting at 1 PM yesterday afternoon, bombarded our positions on the southern bank of the Suzhou River with dense artillery fire. The Toyota Mill was one of the enemy's targets. We also returned fire. For a time, the roaring sound shook western Shanghai. It did not stop until late evening. Many enemy shells landed in the extraterritorial road construction area of Brenan Road. Four British defense soldiers were killed by stray bullets, and two were injured. Nearby residents also suffered casualties. However, the damage to our military positions was minimal.</p>
<h3>Our Army's New Defensive Positions Are Exceptionally Solid</h3>
<p>From Xiaonanxiang via Jiangqiao to Fanwangdu, the Defenses on the South Bank of the Suzhou River Are Particularly Strong.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 8:05 PM on the 29th that the front lines on both sides of the Suzhou River from Nanxiang have been arranged. From Xiaonanxiang, going southeast at Wujiafen, it crosses the Datong-Nanxiang Highway, then to Luoyang Bridge, along a section of the Zhenru-Nanxiang Highway, and then southwest, crossing the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway, passing through Jiangqiao Town, and then in a straight line south along the west bank of the Shenji Creek, reaching Yaojiadu on the north bank of the Suzhou River and Yaojia Residence on the south bank, mutually supporting each other and blocking the river. It then continues southeast along the south bank of the Suzhou River to Beixinjing and then to Fanwangdu. The fortifications along the river on the south bank are particularly solid. The enemy has been bombing with airplanes and heavy artillery for days, but there has been no damage. There have been no changes in the positions north of Xiaonanxiang.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that after the enemy troops occupied Zhabei and Datong, they feared an ambush by our troops. Therefore, they advanced westward along the western line of Zhongshan Road and Jiaotong Road, one route going directly to the Suzhou River via Great China University. However, the bridges have been cut, preventing them from crossing. Another route went through Zhenru and reached Zhoujia Bridge Town on the north bank, confronting our troops across the river. The Qiujiang River to the west is still being defended by our troops, forming a solid front line with Jiangqiao. Xiaonanxiang and Guangfu are still firmly held by our troops. In the Luodian area, our positions at Shi Xiangong Temple and Cao Wang Temple are exceptionally solid. However, for the sake of adjusting the defensive line, they have been slightly shifted westward automatically. The previous reports that they had retreated to Dengqiao Town are now known to be inaccurate. The line north to Liu River is unusually quiet. A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 8:05 PM on the 29th that the enemy on the north bank of the Suzhou River west of the concession was active and very busy throughout the day. In the northeast of Caojiadu in the morning, there was a movement of enemy troops. In the afternoon, near the Rihua Mill, there were more than fifty enemy plainclothes personnel, coming and going to spy. A unit stationed at Great China University was busy constructing fortifications. An observation post was set up on the roof of the school. Artillery positions were also deployed near the school. In the afternoon, in the Tanzhi Bay area, an enemy balloon was raised to observe our military positions and then landed shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that our agency's war correspondent reported at 8:05 PM on the 29th that starting this morning, the enemy bombarded our military positions west of the Toyota Mill on the south bank of the Suzhou River with heavy artillery, concentrating especially on Huacao Town. Enemy aircraft also came back and forth to scout and drop bombs. It was a bit quieter in the afternoon. However, at 4:30 PM, the artillery fire started again. The Toyota Mill was hit by a shell and caught fire, which had not been extinguished as of the time of the report.</p>
<h3>Two Enemy Stealth Crossing Attempts Were Repelled; Fierce Fighting at Huangjia and Xiajia Residences</h3>
<p>Enemy Dead and Wounded Littered the Ground; Fighting Did Not Stop Until Midnight.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 8:05 PM on the 29th that the enemy army moved south from Zhenru along Zhenbei Road and then advanced westward along the north bank of the Suzhou River, operating in areas such as Lujia Warehouse, Jinjia Residence, Houjia Mound, and Xi'antou, and constructing fortifications along the north bank of the river and the east bank of Xibin. Xibin is parallel to Shenji Creek, with the narrowest distance about half a kilometer. At dawn today, three small boats were discovered in the Xi'antou area, fully loaded with enemy troops attempting to cross the river stealthily at Xibin. Our troops immediately launched a fierce attack with machine guns and hand grenades, immediately sinking two of them. Enemy soldiers tried to escape by swimming, but our troops took aim and killed many of them. The remaining boat, seeing the unfavorable situation, immediately turned its rudder and fled. In the afternoon, across from Beixinjing, there was an enemy motorboat loaded with enemy soldiers, also attempting to cross the river stealthily, which was also repelled by our troops. At the same time, enemy troops on the opposite bank opened fire with small artillery and machine guns, exchanging fire for a long time. The fighting gradually intensified in the evening. Our troops have been on high alert and are determined not to let them cross.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 12:00 AM on the 29th that starting at 5:00 PM this afternoon, the enemy army bombarded the Huangjia Residence and Xiajia Residence area on the north bank of the Suzhou River with mortars, with great intensity. At around 7:00 PM, the enemy army charged our positions. Our troops also came out of the trenches to meet them. The enemy dead and wounded littered the ground. The fierce fighting did not stop until midnight.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Attacked Xiaonanxiang Twice Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Our Fierce Counterattack, the Enemy Suffered 800 Casualties.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that our agency's correspondent reported at 12:00 AM on the 29th that after our troops retreated to the new front lines, the enemy continuously attacked our Xiaonanxiang positions. The two sides fought fiercely more than ten times. However, our troops have always held the area. Yesterday morning, the enemy attacked our positions with more than a brigade. After our brave resistance and five hours of bloody fighting, the enemy was repelled. At 4:30 PM in the afternoon, the enemy came to attack again with reinforcements. We immediately returned fire with fierce artillery fire and engaged in a bayonet charge. The fighting continued until midnight. In total, the enemy casualties were over 800. After this heavy blow, the enemy has shown signs of wavering.</p>
<h3>Enemy Shelling of Toyota Mill; Stray Bullets Killed British Soldiers</h3>
<p>Four Killed, Two Wounded; Many Innocent Residents Died.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the enemy troops entrenched on the north bank of the Suzhou River in western Shanghai continuously shelled our army positions at the Toyota Mill on the south bank of the river. Stray bullets flew in the extraterritorial road construction area, such as Brenan Road and Great Western Road, with as many as fourteen shells landing. The above-mentioned areas are garrisoned by British troops. Around 6:00 PM in the evening, the shelling intensified. Two shells landed next to the Suzhou River on Great Western Road, killing three British soldiers on the spot and wounding two others. A total of eight nearby residents were killed by bullets. Another shell landed inside No. 1475 Yu Yuan Road, seriously wounding one British soldier, who soon died. Two Chinese were killed and wounded British soldiers were sent to Hong En Hospital for treatment. They are expected to recover soon. At the same time, five men and two women near Zhaofeng Garden were injured by artillery shells and were sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, six shells landed in the Caojiadu Triangle Field in western Shanghai, killing one person and injuring fourteen. The injured were sent to Shi En Hospital by the rescue team for treatment. Their names are as follows: Zhang Genrong, 25 years old; Wu Anru, 37 years old; Wu Gendi, 25 years old; Zhou Zhangshi, 30 years old; Gu An'an, 23 years old; Zhang Linsheng, 20 years old; Peng Lushi, 44 years old; Zhang Amao, 35 years old; Chen Heshang, 25 years old; Lu Guiru, 16 years old; Wan Bo'fu, 30 years old; Yang Rugen, 26 years old, etc. A small steel artillery shell suddenly fell from the sky near the Columbia Road West Flag General Assembly on the Da West Road, which was built by Wanxi beyond the boundary, but fortunately, no one was passing by at the time, and no injuries were reported. Also, in Hejiajiao, Zhongshan Road, at about 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a stray bullet flew and landed in the field next to Yangcun Elementary School and did not explode.</p>
<h3>Enemy Armed Motorboats Actually Sailed into the Suzhou River Yesterday</h3>
<p>Attempting to Attack Our Troops, but Were Repelled by British Troops.</p>
<p>Two enemy armed motorboats, fully loaded with naval marines, sailed into the Suzhou River from the Huangpu River at 3:30 PM yesterday, attempting to sail west. When passing the Old Zha Bridge, they were stopped by British troops. The two sides confronted each other for about two hours. After senior officers of the British, American, French, and Italian garrison forces went to negotiate, they retreated at about 5:00 PM. At that time, a temporary curfew was declared along the river, and the situation was very tense. Traffic was restored ten minutes after the issue was resolved. The reporter's eyewitness account is recorded below:</p>
<p>Armed Boats Entered the Suzhou River</p>
<p>The enemy boats were painted in a gray-blue color, with the rising sun flag hanging at the stern, fully loaded with armed marines, about forty or fifty in total, along with several news reporters, holding cameras, mixed among them. At that time, there were many civilian boats parked in the river, and the waterway was extremely narrow. Because the two boats could not move smoothly, they ordered the boatmen on both sides to give way, threatening them with guns from time to time. When they approached the Old Zha Bridge (Fujian Road) near the Old Garbage Bridge (Zhejiang Road), they were discovered by the British garrison troops on both banks and on the bridge, who immediately ordered them to stop and prohibited them from passing. The British troops also took cover in defensive positions to prevent any eventuality. At that time, the situation was extremely tense. The patrol room immediately sent Chinese and Western police officers to the scene to disperse the pedestrians, and set up barbed wire at both bridge piers, temporarily prohibiting pedestrians from passing.</p>
<p>Blocked by Garrison Negotiations</p>
<p>The enemy boats stopped in the middle of the river, refusing to leave. At about 4:00 PM, senior officers of the British, American, French, Italian, and International Settlement Municipal Council came together and immediately negotiated with them. At that time, all that could be seen on both sides of the river were cars and motorcycles busy traveling back and forth on the north bank. After about half an hour, the British, American, and other garrison officers left first. Then the police officers notified the civilian boats to move out of the way, clearing the waterway. At about 5:00 PM, the two boats began to retreat in single file. When passing the Old Zha Bridge, one person released five carrier pigeons, apparently to transmit a message. About ten minutes later, traffic was restored.</p>
<p>Purpose Was to Attack Our Troops</p>
<p>Afterwards, according to the person in charge of the British garrison troops, the Japanese troops had complied with the order to retreat and would probably not come again in the future. As for the enemy boats' intention for this trip, it seemed to be to test the attitude of the concession authorities, trying to open this route to attack our troops. It was heard that the enemy even argued strongly at the time, saying that the Suzhou River has always been managed by our country, and now that the enemy troops have occupied Zhabei, they have the right to travel there. Later, due to a lack of reason, they said that they could not retreat without orders from their superiors. Their barbarity and unreasonableness can be imagined. However, in the end, due to the strong attitude of the British side, they had no choice but to retreat. What will happen in the future is worth our attention.</p>
<h3>The National Flag Fluttered, A Mighty Sight, Our Isolated Army Repelled the Enemy Four Times</h3>
<p>So far, it has been three days and three nights, totaling one hundred hours. The enemy fears our machine gun fire and uses police dogs to drag back the corpses. Brave soldiers shout, "Long live the Republic of China!"</p>
<p>Our 88th Division's Xie Regiment, Yang Battalion's isolated army of eight hundred, remained safely stationed yesterday in the Sihang Warehouse on Guangfu Road, north of Suzhou Creek, using their minimal ammunition to make a final stand against the enemy, vowing to defend this piece of Zhabei to the death. Although the enemy forces attacked continuously from morning till night, they remained unshaken, with no casualties among the brave soldiers. Nearby citizens voluntarily fasted for a day, using the saved grains of rice to support the isolated army. Comfort items piled up like mountains. Chinese and foreigners alike flocked to admire them, shouting "Long live the Republic of China!" across Suzhou Creek. The bright and dazzling blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag fluttered atop the tall building, boldly proclaiming its inviolable spirit. This truly sets an unprecedented and magnificent record in the history of European wars.</p>
<p>Holding Firm for One Hundred Hours Without Retreating</p>
<p>It is verified that these eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers, led by Deputy Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu, retreated into the warehouse from their original station at the North Railway Station at 1:00 AM on the 26th. They have now been defending this piece of Zhabei to the death for three days and three nights, totaling one hundred hours. During this time, the enemy forces have exhausted all means to try to drive away our loyal and brave soldiers, but they have been repelled by the extraordinary spirit of our isolated army. The British troops stationed in the area, many of whom had participated in the European war, believed that there had been no such loyal and courageous spirit even in the European war. Therefore, they sincerely and earnestly advised our troops to lay down their arms and ammunition and retreat into the concession, so as not to make a heroic sacrifice. Our army was very grateful for the British troops' loving friendship, but all eight hundred of our brave soldiers were determined to sacrifice themselves for the country and were willing to shed their last drop of blood to defend this precious last position, making the most glorious sacrifice in a final stand against the Japanese army. Therefore, apart from expressing gratitude to the British troops, none of the brave soldiers were willing to accept the request to escape. Seeing this situation, many of the British troops were also moved and praised them.</p>
<p>Four Fierce Attacks All Repelled</p>
<p>At 3:00 AM, 7:10 AM, 3:45 PM, and 5:10 PM yesterday, the enemy forces launched four fierce attacks on the warehouse where our army was stationed, all of which were repelled by our army. The two attacks in the afternoon were the most intense, killing more than forty enemy soldiers. The bodies were abandoned by the Suzhou Creek, and the enemy did not dare to collect them, instead using police dogs to drag them away. The four attacks are described in detail below: (1) At 3:00 AM and 7:10 AM, each time the enemy forces consisted of only a dozen or so soldiers, carrying guns and ammunition, sneaking in along the wall from next door. Our army had already detected them, but pretended not to know. When the enemy approached the warehouse door, they immediately took advantage of the high ground, throwing grenades fiercely at the enemy. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the enemy hurriedly fled westward for their lives, and many of them were shot and killed. (2) At about 3:30 PM, the enemy used two motorboats, each carrying more than a hundred soldiers and a light machine gun. The soldiers each carried rifles or grenades and sailed from the Huangpu River into the Suzhou Creek, heading towards the Sihang Warehouse. When they sailed past the Waibaidu Bridge to the embankment of the old garbage bridge, they were discovered by the British troops stationed along the Suzhou Creek. They immediately blocked their advance, advising the enemy troops in extremely amiable language not to advance, so as not to endanger the concession. After two hours of negotiations, they finally left. (3) At 3:45 PM, rifle and machine gun fire erupted from the area near the new garbage bridge embankment, interspersed with the sound of grenades and steel cannons. More than sixty enemy soldiers had attacked for the third time from the Shanghai Bank warehouse. When the enemy approached, our army peered out, concentrating their minds, boosting their courage, and firing machine guns and grenades like rain. Most of the attacking enemy soldiers were hit and fell to the ground, and the rest fled. Enemy corpses were abandoned in front of the warehouse door and by the Suzhou Creek, and the enemy did not dare to come to collect them for a long time. After a while, several police dogs, as tall as children, were seen coming forward to grab the enemy corpses in their mouths, intending to drag them back. Our army immediately fired with rifles, and one dog was also hit and killed. (4) At 5:10 PM, more than ten enemy soldiers launched a fourth fierce attack. After our army fired a machine gun for about two minutes, the attacking enemy was finally repelled. In this battle, four or five enemy soldiers were killed, while our army suffered no casualties.</p>
<p>National Flag Fluttering, Spirit Soaring</p>
<p>Yesterday, from morning till night, the reporter stood on a high building at the intersection of Changsha Road to observe. What I saw cannot be fully described in words. At about 5:00 AM, the nearby alleys were already crowded with people, including some foreigners, admiring our loyal and brave soldiers across the river. Comfort items piled up like mountains at each road intersection. There were more than ten trucks at the garbage bridge embankment on Xiamen Road, filled with food such as bread, candy, and fruit. Among the crowd, there was also a foreign woman throwing a bundle of cigarettes from the south bank to the north bank, but unfortunately, her aim was inaccurate, and they all fell into the Suzhou Creek. Two national flags were hung on the left and right of the south-facing window of the Sihang Warehouse. On the roof of the building, a blue sky, white sun, and red earth national flag, about six feet long and four feet wide, was raised high, fluttering in the wind, boldly proclaiming its inviolable spirit amidst the surrounding enemy flags. The people looked up at it, feeling even more excited, and respectfully admired the loyal and courageous spirit of the eight hundred soldiers. They took off their hats and waved them across the river to salute our army. Our brave soldiers also shouted "Long live the Republic of China!" from the high ground, their voices both strong and fierce. This kind of magnificent and great spirit inspires infinite admiration and emotion.</p>
<p>People Stand and Take Off Their Hats to Salute</p>
<p>After the news spread that the eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers of our isolated army were holding firm in the Sihang Warehouse on Guangfu Road in Zhabei, refusing to retreat, the whole country was excited and the world was shocked. What was most exciting was that yesterday morning, as the first rays of dawn rose, the glorious national emblem of the blue sky and white sun, representing our great Republic of China, was firmly established on the top of the high warehouse, fluttering in the wind, making it even more brilliant. Foreigners and Chinese people flocked to observe it, endlessly. The area around Yu Qiaqing Road and Xinzha Road was jammed. People across the river, passing through the area, took off their hats and faced north, saluting the national flag and the loyal and brave soldiers. At that time, foreign people, seeing this scene, also expressed deep sympathy. The reporter also participated in this grand roadside ceremony and personally heard two Westerners talking to each other, roughly saying that Japan, which has been recuperating for sixty years and is known as a first-class power in East Asia, has been fighting bitterly with China, which has been in civil war for twenty years, in a corner of Shanghai for more than seventy days, and has only made five miles of progress. It is enough for the Japanese to feel ashamed now that the world is watching. On the banks of the Suzhou Creek in Zhabei, which the Japanese army has allegedly occupied, the brilliant national flag of China, with its blue sky and white sun, is found flying high. What could be more interesting than this? Japan has left a stain on the history of its invasion of China that cannot be washed away.</p>
<p>Division Commander Sun Urges Brave Soldiers to Defend to the Death</p>
<p>Sun Yuanliang, the commander of the 88th Division, wrote to the brave soldiers defending the stronghold in Zhabei on the 29th. The original letter reads: "Deputy Regiment Commander Xie, Battalion Commander Yang, and my loyal and brave soldiers, I am currently on the front line. Although I am on the front line, my heart and soul are with all the soldiers in Zhabei. I was ordered to operate the defensive axis of Zhabei to protect our territory. Comrades, you have bravely resisted the enemy and defended it for two and a half months. The Japanese invaders have ultimately failed to cross the Lei Pool boundary. You have served the country, and I am fortunate that you are not behind others. Recently, due to the movement of a hair, the entire line shifted westward, and our army was also ordered to transfer its position, entrusting the responsibility of defending Zhabei to my loyal and brave soldiers. Comrades, you can obey orders, defend the stronghold to the death, and vow to coexist with Zhabei. I and all the officers and soldiers of the army pay the highest respect to this kind of firm and unwavering spirit of being ordered in danger. Since ancient times, the Chinese nation has had many brave people who are willing to face difficulties. The Yue Family Army stood firm, and General Qi's soldiers were brave and repelled the enemy. They dedicated themselves to the country, and their heroic spirit will forever remain in the world. Our National Revolutionary Army is endowed with this virtue, and with the teachings of the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, we do not hesitate to sacrifice and have long embraced the determination to become benevolent. This battle has been fought to kill the enemy, truly opening a historical miracle that shook the world. Hundreds of millions of descendants of our Yellow Emperor, and hundreds of millions of people all over the world, will surely read this page of history with sincerity. Comrades, you have been guarding Zhabei in isolation for three days. The enemy's timidity and our bravery have been seen by the whole world. Chinese and foreigners in Shanghai admire you, and the people are running around to help, all bearing the wish that "if it can be redeemed, a hundred lives will be spent." This is truly the glory of our Chinese nation, the glory of our Republic of China, and the glory of the soldiers of our National Revolutionary Army. I hope that you will continue to fight bravely, complete the mission of resisting the enemy, and shed the last drop of blood. - Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang, is particularly pleased with the heroic sacrifices of all the comrades. I respectfully relay this message. Sun Yuanliang, October 29th."</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Xie's Letter Is Passionate and Inspiring</p>
<p>Yesterday, a certain organization in this city obtained a letter from Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan, who is holding firm in the Sihang Warehouse at the northern end of the new garbage bridge. It roughly stated that "Soldiers take obedience as their bounden duty, and it is their duty to defend the country and protect the soil. We will spill the last drop of blood and demand a considerable price from the Japanese pirates. We will also use every gun and bullet to deal with the enemy to the end." His passion and generosity are admirable.</p>
<p>The Sihang Authorities Consider It an Honor</p>
<p>Since our isolated army stationed themselves in the Sihang Savings Society Warehouse on Guangfu Road in Zhabei, they have held firm and refused to retreat despite the persuasion of all parties and the encirclement and attacks of the enemy. People from China and abroad have admired this spirit of sacrifice and struggle. The reporter made a special trip yesterday to visit Mr. Qian Xinzhi of the Sihang Bank to inquire about his thoughts on our army's stationing in the Sihang Warehouse. According to him, the magnificent actions of our army are sufficient to add a final and particularly brilliant page to the glorious war history of our Zhabei. Our warehouse has also been greatly enhanced by this. Even if the warehouse is destroyed as a result, we will not care. Furthermore, the achievements of our loyal and brave soldiers this time are even more valuable than the martyrdom of Tian Heng's subordinates in history. It would be very fortunate if the warehouse in its insignificance could become as immortal as Tian Heng Island in the future. We should carve this glorious achievement in stone as a permanent memorial.</p>
<p>He Xiangning's Letter Is Full of Comfort and Encouragement</p>
<p>Ms. He Xiangning sent a letter yesterday to comfort the brave soldiers holding the Sihang Warehouse in Zhabei, saying: "To Regiment Commander Xie and all the dear eight hundred heroes, I saw your heroic and courageous spirit in the newspaper, which moved me to tears. But when I ran to the bridge, I couldn't pass through. I can only quietly look at the other side and send you my full and pious love. Every one of you has the revolutionary spirit and the spirit of sacrifice. Whether you succeed or become benevolent, you can be worthy of yourselves. The martyrs will become more great because of you, the soldiers on the front line will become more brave because of you, the people of the whole country will become more united because of you, and international people will also be able to advocate justice more because of you. I have tried to send you some first aid supplies and food, to express my heart. I hope you will fight hard and be full of Sun Yat-sen's and the Party's representatives' hard struggle and sacrifice to the end. Respectfully salute to resist the enemy, He Xiangning, October 29th."</p>
<p>Eight Hundred Thousand Workers in Shanghai Pay Their Respects</p>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions sent a letter to the eight hundred heroes, saying: "To Deputy Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan and Battalion Commander Yang Ruifu of the 88th Division, and all the eight hundred brave soldiers, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan on August 13, our loyal and brave soldiers have fought bravely with their hot blood and heads under the fierce fire of the powerful enemy. Wherever the banner of righteousness pointed, they have repeatedly frustrated the enemy's advance. The glorious and great achievements have aroused unlimited sympathy from the international community and warm admiration from the people in the rear. After fighting hard for two and a half months, we had to painfully withdraw from Zhabei because the large-scale position was broken through by the enemy. However, all the officers and soldiers of your regiment, even though they were in the midst of fire and enemy encirclement, were still willing to shed the last drop of blood, hold the Sihang Warehouse in isolation, and demand the final price from the enemy, fighting for the great personality of our Chinese nation. The uprightness and grandeur are truly shocking to the heavens and moving to the ghosts and gods. The loyalty and greatness can obscure the sun and moon and shine brightly. The Federation of Trade Unions respectfully dedicates its sincere blood and represents eight hundred thousand workers in Shanghai to pay the highest respect and deep comfort to the eight hundred heroes of your army. I am moved to tears as I write this letter. I hope you will accept it. Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions respectfully."</p>
<p>Public Comfort Can Be Converted to Cash</p>
<p>Since the eight hundred heroes of Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan have been holding firm in the Sihang Warehouse, donations from all parties have been extremely enthusiastic. However, there is too much food, which will inevitably rot. It is best to convert it into cash and hand it over to the Shanghai Comfort Committee, so that the items needed by Regiment Commander Xie can be purchased at any time. However, when donating, please specify that it is for the use of Regiment Commander Xie's regiment of the 88th Division.</p>
<p>The Women's Movement Association Telegrams to Plead for Withdrawal</p>
<p>The China Women's Movement League telegrammed Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek, saying: "To Madam Chiang Kai-shek in Nanjing, the isolated army in Zhabei is holding firm and refusing to retreat. Their righteous courage is heart-stirring. Please represent our women's community and beg Chairman Chiang to immediately order a withdrawal to preserve the lives of these eight hundred patriotic soldiers, so that they can be used for long-term resistance. Sincerely, the Shanghai China Women's Movement League."</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Describe It as Admirable and Moving</p>
<p>The North China Daily News said that the Chinese soldiers in the Continental Bank warehouse on North Suzhou Road were still holding the building yesterday. It was reported that many people were urging Chairman Chiang to order them to withdraw from Zhabei. Yesterday, at least two foreign military commanders stationed in Shanghai also telegraphed Nanjing. However, the soldiers of the battalion were unmoved despite all kinds of persuasion. The appeals to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek from all parties showed that the whole city was concerned about the fate of the brave soldiers and expressed sympathy for them. Their courageous spirit was praised by everyone. Yesterday, Chinese and foreigners applied to Mayor Yu and other Chinese officials to find a way to get the brave soldiers to withdraw. One woman was crying while talking on the phone. Many people inquired about the safety of the brave soldiers. A foreigner told Mayor Yu with a surprised voice that there was a shocking rumor that the Japanese army planned to destroy the two warehouses held by the battalion at noon yesterday. Yesterday, people went to Yu Qiaqing Road to see the brave soldiers, causing a traffic jam. It was difficult for the police to maintain order. A representative of the North China Daily News also looked forward from near the Shanghai Waterworks, seeing two Chinese women wiping away tears with towels. The observers were all moved and praised the bravery of the soldiers of the battalion. After the Japanese army occupied Zhabei, they tried to occupy the warehouse from Tuesday morning, but each time they went, they were driven back by the defending soldiers. This resistance could be seen from high places across the river. According to reports, the battalion had refused to retreat into the concession no less than five times on Tuesday, after being persuaded by foreign military officers and the Municipal Council. Yesterday, friends from China and abroad continued to urge them, but to no avail. There were occasional machine gun and rifle sounds near the area throughout the day yesterday. Japanese soldiers used machine guns to shatter several glass windows of a warehouse, but the defending soldiers ignored it. When the Japanese soldiers approached the building, they threw several grenades at them. At about 3:00 PM, three Japanese planes flew over the two warehouses at a relatively low altitude, and the defending soldiers fired at them with machine guns mounted on the roof. The Japanese planes flew away without dropping a single bomb.</p>

For the sake of annihilating the Japanese pirates and ensuring the position, the brigade commander of our certain brigade immediately led his subordinates to fight to the death with the enemy. The morale was greatly boosted as a result, and everyone fought bravely and took the lead, fighting against ten enemies with one soldier, vying to kill the Japanese bandits.

<h3>Atrocities Are Escalating, Enemy Planes Bomb Songjiang and Jiashan</h3>
<p>Dropping More Than a Hundred Bombs in Songjiang, City Houses and Ordinary People Were Destroyed</p>
<p>[Songjiang] Songjiang has been in a state of unrest since being subjected to two inhuman bombings by enemy planes on September 7th and October 24th. Yesterday (the 28th), it was again subjected to indiscriminate bombing. The extent of the damage was detailed in yesterday's telegram. Unexpectedly, at 8:15 this morning, two enemy planes flew over the city from the northeast, dropping four or five bombs. Our defending forces returned fire, and they fled in panic.

<h3>Enemy Warships Bomb Weitou Port in Southern Fujian Yesterday</h3>
<p>Attempted Landing Repelled by Our Forces. Enemy Aircraft Ravage the Coasts of Zhangzhou and Quanzhou.</p>
<p>[Xiamen] After the enemy occupied Jinmen, they attacked Weitou Port, which belongs to Quanzhou, at 5:00 PM on the 28th. Two enemy warships bombarded the shore along with Changdong, and two other aircraft made low-level strafing runs to provide cover for over ten landing craft carrying ground troops attempting to land. Our defending forces engaged them, fighting fiercely until 6:00 PM, when the enemy retreated unsuccessfully. We only had nine civilian militiamen wounded. Weitou is located northeast of Jinmen, facing Jinjiang across the sea. It belongs to the coastal area outside the South Gate of Quanzhou and is also known as Weitou Cape, which is strategically important. After the enemy further occupied Lieyu, nearing Xiamen's harbor on the 28th, they constantly used aircraft to reconnoiter the coastlines of Xiamen Island, Tong'an, and Haicheng. From 12:00 PM to over 2:00 PM, the city of Xiamen sounded alarms four times. Enemy speedboats scouted the waters between Xiamen, Wutong, Tong'an, and Aotou but did not dare to approach. At 11:00 AM, one enemy aircraft attempted to bomb the Jiangdong Bridge on the Jiulong River in Chelu Tu, Zhangzhou, but all four bombs missed due to the intense anti-aircraft fire. Three fell into the water, and one fell east of the bridge, causing no damage. Traffic in Xiamen is normal. Furthermore, the small steamer Tong'an departed from Xiamen to Tong'an on the afternoon of the 29th and was pursued by enemy aircraft en route at Wutong. The steamer Hou'an, bound for Tong'an, was also pursued. (Twenty-ninth Special Dispatch)</p>

This bridge is located in a low-lying area and is not a road for vehicles to pass. Also, on the afternoon of the 29th, the small steamer Tong'an departed from Xiamen to Tong'an, carrying passengers, and was chased back by enemy aircraft, which opened fire with machine guns, fortunately without injuring anyone.

<h3>China National Revolutionary League Announces Formal Dissolution</h3>
<p>Sufficient to Enhance the Belief in National Unity, Contributing All Strength to the Government to Serve in the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The China National Revolutionary League was organized and advocated by Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingkai, Jiang Guangnai, Chen Youren, Xu Qian, etc., with the slogan of resisting Japan and saving the nation. Since the Lugou Bridge and Shanghai incidents, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the central government has launched a great full-scale war of resistance. The League believes that all the people of the country should do their best to support the government and resist the war under the leadership of the supreme leader in order to achieve final victory. Therefore, on October 30, it issued a declaration formally dissolving the organization of the League. The declaration is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration of the China National Revolutionary League</p>
<p>The purpose of the establishment of our China National Revolutionary League lies in promoting the concentration of the entire nation's strength to resist Japan in order to achieve China's independence, freedom, and equality. Since the Lugou Bridge and Shanghai incidents, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, the whole country has resolutely waged a sacred war of self-defense. Our nation has shown unprecedented unity. At this time when this great national war is gradually unfolding, we should, with an open and sincere attitude, jointly seek the consolidation of national unity and promote the success of the national war of resistance. Therefore, in August, we issued a declaration calling on League members at home and abroad and compatriots across the country to fully mobilize, do their best, support the government, and resist the war to the end. On October 25, the Supreme Council resolved to formally dissolve the organization of the China National Revolutionary League. We firmly believe that this bright expression is sufficient to enhance the belief in the unity of the entire nation. All the strength of our League organizations at home and abroad will naturally be contributed to the government to serve in the war of resistance in order to implement our long-cherished aspirations. It is hoped that all League members will, from now on, sharpen their skills and, based on their years of determination to resist the war, become loyal soldiers of the nation. We also hope that our government, in this critical moment of survival, will actively mobilize the people of the whole country to jointly participate in this sacred national war in order to strive for final victory, complete the mission of national liberation, and realize a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. This is solemnly declared. (Twenty-ninth Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

The article stated that although the Chinese army is not adequately equipped with machinery, it has established an everlasting military honor in this Sino-Japanese war, and the Chinese soldiers' determination to resist cannot be shaken in the slightest, truly preserving the glory of China.

<h3>Panchen Lama Donates Funds for War of Resistance</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Panchen Lama recently telegraphed Nanjing, stating: "The brutal Japanese are invading our China. Our nation and our generals are, under the leadership of the Central Government, engaged in a tragic and heroic comprehensive war of resistance for the permanent survival of the nation. Over the past two months, they have dealt a serious blow to the enemy, and good news is frequently reported, arousing excitement far and wide. The Panchen Lama is obstructed in the western regions but his heart is concerned with the south. In addition to giving alms to high monks in major temples in Qinghai and Kangding and setting up altars to chant sutras and pray for the victory of our army, he plans to donate 30,000 legal tender and purchase 20,000 yuan of national salvation bonds for the needs of the war of resistance."

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Says Attacking Nanshi is Quite Difficult</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th: A Foreign Ministry spokesman, when meeting with reporters today, showed them a map of Shanghai and photographs of sandbag defenses built on the borders of Nanshi and the French Concession, explaining the difficulty of the Japanese army's attack on Nanshi to the reporters. He said that the situation was extremely complex and that although the Japanese army was being cautious everywhere, it was feared that unexpected unfortunate incidents might still occur. When asked whether the Japanese government would support Mussolini's proposal to restore Germany's position in Africa, the spokesman replied that the question was too big for him to answer.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Bomb Pudong</h3>
<p>A Total of Over One Hundred Shells Fired; No Damage to Our Side Whatsoever - Enemy Aircraft Also Dropped Bombs -</p>
<p>The enemy continues to use threatening tactics against the Pudong positions. Yesterday, after 9:30 AM, the ships in the Huangpu River intermittently shelled again. Because it was during the day, the noise was reduced. A total of five warships participated, one anchored off Yangshupu, two off Huazhanpu, and three off the Taikong Wharf. At the same time, three or four enemy aircraft circled over Pudong to reconnoiter and strafed pedestrians with machine guns. The enemy warships stopped shelling around 2:00 PM, after firing over one hundred shells in total, causing no damage to our military. Around 3:00 PM, four enemy heavy bombers flew over Pudong again to circle and reconnoiter and dropped bombs, but because they flew too high and the targets were inaccurate, only a dozen or so civilian houses in the Xinmalu area were destroyed. Most of the bombs fell in the fields, causing no loss to our military. At 5:20 PM in the evening, one ship anchored off the Japanese consulate again shelled Pudong, firing five shots in succession before stopping. Also, at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday, three enemy aircraft dropped six bombs in Gaoqiao Town, Pudong, destroying a dozen civilian houses and killing four residents.</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University Never Used for Military Purposes</h3>
<p>The School is Now a Refugee Shelter. The French Side Notifies the Japanese Army Not to Attack.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 29th, Allied News Agency: A Japanese spokesman claimed that Jiaotong University in Xujiahui is now a military base for our army and that the Japanese side will bomb it. However, Jiaotong University is currently the Sixth Refugee Shelter organized by the International Relief Committee and has already taken in more than 1,600 refugees, and it is never used for military purposes. The Japanese claim is obviously inaccurate. It is heard that the French side of the committee has already notified Okamoto, the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, asking him to inform the Japanese authorities not to bomb it.</p>
<h3>Zhu Yaohua Not Yet Dead</h3>
<p>His Injuries Are Too Severe, and There is Little Hope of Survival</p>

The bullet entered from the left chest, pierced the lungs, and exited from the stomach. He immediately fell to the ground, but when collecting the body, it was suddenly discovered that Division Commander Zhu still had a weak breath. He was immediately taken to a hospital in Shanghai for treatment, but his injuries were too severe, and there was very little hope of survival. He may fulfill his intention of dying for the country.</p>
<h3>German Note Replies to Belgian Government, Declining to Participate in Nine-Power Conference</h3>
<p>To Avoid Getting Involved in the Vortex; U.S. Delegation Has Arrived in Brussels; Italy Will Be Represented by the Foreign Minister.</p>
<p>[Berlin] Germany has now refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to be convened in Beijing next month. The German reply stated that the conference was convened based on Article VII of the Nine-Power Treaty, and the topic for discussion is how to implement that article. Since Germany is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, it feels unable to participate in the conference. However, the reply stated that Germany is willing to participate in actions aimed at resolving disputes when adequate guarantees are obtained for the indispensable preliminary conditions. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German government has recently decided to refuse to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Since the Belgian government invited Germany to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, political figures initially declared that there was no inconvenience for Germany to send representatives to the Brussels conference. However, they later changed their minds, believing that it was better for Germany to maintain a neutral attitude toward the conflict between China and Japan. Although German political figures support Japan's policies, believing that their purpose is to prevent the new development of Bolshevism in the Far East, if Germany openly sided with Japan, it would be regarded as an unfriendly attitude in China. For this reason, the German government has recently decided not to attend the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, preferring to stay out of the conflict between China and Japan. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>⊙Brussels The U.S. delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, led by Chief Delegate Davis, arrived here from Paris yesterday evening. U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Gibson and representatives from the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs welcomed them at the station. After Mr. Davis got out of the car, he refused to make any statements to reporters. (Maritime Telegraph dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Diplomatic sources say that the Soviet Union has decided to send representatives to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The candidate will be led by Foreign Minister Litvinov. Our representative Gu Weijun telegraphed that he will go to Belgium in one day. (Special dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Italian delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference may be led by Foreign Minister Count Ciano. If so, Ciano may take the opportunity to meet with British Foreign Secretary Eden for discussions. However, this matter will not be definitively decided until the last moment.

<h3>Major Powers Should Take Collective Action to Deal with Pacific Aggressors</h3>
<p>[Moscow] On the matter of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet government's official newspaper, "News," recently commented that convening a conference to discuss practical measures to stop illegal and criminal adventures is clumsy and useless. On the contrary, the countries directly concerned, if they can take joint action to deal with aggressive actions on the west coast of the Pacific Ocean, will be sufficient. After the Nine-Power Treaty Conference opens in Brussels, it may soon produce a new Non-Intervention Committee. The German delegation has obviously obtained Japan's permission to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, seemingly representing allied countries dedicated to aggression and violating international treaties. In this way, even if Japan does not attend, someone can speak for it. What is regrettable is that the so-called Western democratic countries do not have the necessary determination and perseverance to maintain peace in the Far East. In the United States, Japan's aggressive actions are a very serious blow to the interests held by the United States in the Far East. President Roosevelt expressed a more practical attitude towards maintaining peace in his recent speech. This U.S. foreign policy may contribute to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Newspapers Criticize Japan for Violating International Treaties</h3>
<p>[New York] U.S. newspapers hold different opinions on Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The "New York Post" and "World-Telegram" express pessimism about the future of the conference. The "New York Sun" and "Times" criticize Japan's attitude. The "New York Post" (which seems to lean towards the Republican Party) says that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference can only achieve a moral condemnation of Japan and non-recognition of the situation created by its aggression in order to save the faces of the participants. Other than that, there is no practical effect, just like the U.S. non-recognition of "Manchukuo". The "New York Times" (which leans towards the Democratic Party) says that Japan repeatedly defends itself, claiming that the invasion of China is for self-defense, which is hard to believe. Japan also says that the Sino-Japanese conflict does not involve the Nine-Power Treaty, which assumes that countries around the world have forgotten Japan's acts of aggression. The "Sun" says that Japan's refusal to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference proves that the Japanese military has once again succeeded in obstructing the country's diplomatic authorities.

<h3>New Governor Discusses Far East Problem</h3>
<p>[Guangzhou] At a welcome reception in Hong Kong on the 28th, the newly appointed Governor of Hong Kong, Geoffry Northcote, spoke about the Far East issue, saying that today, amidst the prevailing turmoil, China and Japan are at war. I do not wish to comment on the right and wrong of this incident, but the League of Nations Advisory Committee is making its best efforts to find a way to resolve this slaughter of humanity and destruction of humanity. I wish to join everyone in hoping that the Brussels conference will proceed smoothly, so that the crisis developing in China today can be eliminated. Now, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty are engaged in this purpose, and no efforts exceed those of the British Empire. Hong Kong can certainly contribute to this, and I hope that we will do our best to follow it. Finally, Governor Northcote specifically mentioned the "neighborly" policy adopted by the previous governor, saying that he is determined to continue to implement it with the greatest effort.

<h3>Japan's Unquenchable Aggression Arouses Vigilance in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Urgently Seeking to Strengthen Far East Defenses; Britain Speeds Up Shipbuilding</p>
<p>⊙Manila The Sino-Japanese war has prompted European countries with territories in the Far East that are affected by Japan's southward policy to urgently seek to strengthen their defense work. Britain is at the forefront, so despite the fierce arms race in Europe, it has to allocate some of its strength to consider the military bases in Singapore and Hong Kong. The Netherlands, due to the fertile land of the East Indies, will further massively strengthen its Asian armaments next month, adding aircraft and warships. The Philippines, being adjacent to Japan, has established an autonomous government for less than two years and is using a quarter of its annual revenue to build an army. The Philippines feels a particular stake in the Sino-Japanese war, fearing that it will be annexed by Japan once it becomes independent. Soviet Russia's military strength in Siberia is comparable to Japan's, with 300,000 troops in addition to a large number of aircraft, artillery, and tanks. At the same time, French Indochina, in light of Japan's southward policy, has to reorganize its military. Thailand, although on very good terms with Japan, is still purchasing warships from Japan and Italy to establish a navy, showing that Japan's aggressive ambitions have been eyed by the world. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] It is claimed here that, according to Britain's armament plan, 32 warships were newly completed in January of this year, including six cruisers, nine destroyers, three submarines, and fourteen minesweepers. Next year's plan is to add one aircraft carrier, five cruisers, sixteen destroyers, ten submarines, and sixteen small ships. As for 1939, four aircraft carriers, seven cruisers, twenty-four destroyers, seven submarines, and eleven small ships will be built. In 1940, the two battleships "George V" and "Prince of Wales" will be built. (Maritime Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<h3>Britain's Far East Policy Still Based on League of Nations</h3>
<p>British Undersecretary Speaks in the House of Commons; Pleased with U.S. Participation and Cooperation</p>
<p>[London] Undersecretary Cranborne spoke in the House of Commons today, stating that Geneva will do its best to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute and that Britain's foreign policy is still based on the League of Nations. During the debate on the address to the British monarch, Cranborne rose to intervene and refute the opposition party's criticism that the king's speech did not directly mention the League of Nations, proving that the government had abandoned the League, saying that the opposition party's remarks were completely unfounded, just as if the speech did not mention maintaining the constitution, it would immediately be said that it was the precursor to a red revolution. Cranborne continued that the League of Nations is currently encountering a very special kind of problem. The House of Commons should know that the British government has tried to make close contact with the U.S. government, which is very important. Not only London thinks so, but Geneva also thinks so. This move has had a great impact on the resolution of the 22-member Advisory Committee to deal with the problem. When the committee gathered, it recognized that there are two main tasks: first, to be the mouthpiece of world opinion. The committee's conduct of this work has expressed alarm at the inhuman and barbaric methods of warfare used in the dispute, and it is necessary to review all the facts that have occurred since the July 7th Lugou Bridge Incident. After a completely objective and fair review by the committee, it was unanimously decided that Japan should not take the actions it has taken, which have violated the Nine-Power Treaty and the Paris Peace Pact. Its report has implemented the first step of the League of Nations' work. The second step is even more urgent, that is, to end the war if possible. The League of Nations must not only decide what kind of action is in accordance with the League of Nations Covenant, what kind of action seems to be effective, but also what kind of action seems to be the most promising basis for consideration, whether the League of Nations acts alone or on other bases. If the League of Nations acts alone, it cannot take any moderate or other actions without the full participation of non-member states whose cooperation it must obtain. This is very obvious. Is there any other more effective basis than the Covenant? It covers all the points whose cooperation seems necessary. In view of these facts, the committee proposed convening a Nine-Power Treaty Conference to consider the dispute. Now, some people still say that the League of Nations, in addition to making suggestions, should take economic action on its own. This is to ignore an important factor, that is, it is necessary to know the degree of cooperation before one can speak of whether any action taken seems to be effective. Since the basis of the League of Nations' independent action has failed to satisfy this condition, if action is taken without knowing whether it seems to be effective, it will not only fail, but it is indeed dangerous. The Undersecretary concluded that the action taken by the League of Nations to consult with the countries of the Nine-Power Treaty is the only promising way forward.

<h3>Ambassador Wang Speaks in the U.S.</h3>
<p>Stating That We Are Determined to Resist Japan's Aggression to the End</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting spoke at a luncheon at the National Press Club today, saying that China has made more progress in the past ten years than in a hundred years, and has surpassed Japan in many aspects. Japan is worried that China will complete its work, so it is at war with China in order to stop its progress, but Japan will never succeed. The Chinese people are determined to resist the war to the end, and even if there is only one soldier and one bullet left, they will fight. (Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Wang mocked Japan's propaganda that Japan is willing to be friendly with China, saying that I believe that countries around the world will not believe Japan's lies, because there is no one in the world who is friendly to people but attacks them. If one speaks of friendship but actually attacks people, then their purpose must be to kill or enslave people. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<h3>American Isolationists Agitate Again</h3>

<p>[Washington] Six American peace groups today, regarding the policies of the American naval authorities, once again unleashed their eloquent voices, launching attacks, especially expressing deep dissatisfaction with the order from the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, that "if Japanese aircraft attack American defense positions in Shanghai, retaliate as appropriate." They believe that this action is greatly contrary to the spirit of the neutrality law and will inevitably involve the United States in a political vortex. Therefore, they are demanding that the government promptly reiterate its neutrality policy. (28th National)</p>

<h3>Italy Supports Germany's Demand for the Return of Colonies</h3>
<p>The Prelude to Joint Practical Action Lloyd George Criticizes British Foreign Policy</p>
<p>[London] Mussolini's support for Germany's demand for the return of colonies is seen here today as the initial step toward joint practical action between the two countries, which is of great significance for the future relationship between Britain and France. Furthermore, according to powerful figures here, after the Great War, it was the governments of the British autonomous dominions, not London, that accepted Germany's colonies. For example, the Union of South Africa took over Germany's colonies in southwestern Africa, which has nothing to do with London. Moreover, if Britain agrees to Germany's request, Britain's position in Africa will also be greatly disadvantaged. For example, if Tanganyika in north-central Africa is returned to Germany, Britain's Kenya will be surrounded by German and Italian territories. Therefore, Britain is even more concerned about this matter than France. (29th National dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] The Times recently published an article arguing that Germany's demand for the restoration of its former colonies is quite legitimate, and believing that if Britain makes concessions on the colonial issue, Germany may be able to assist in the resolution of various European problems. After reading this, officials here expressed dissatisfaction, especially criticizing the idea of "exchanging" colonies for German cooperation, saying that this view is absolutely contrary to Britain's current policy. Conservative Party members said that the party unanimously passed resolutions at its two major conferences last year and this year, advocating that all of the country's colonies must not be divided in any way. This resolution is sufficient to reflect the government's views, which is very clear. (28th Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Lloyd George said in the House of Commons today, roughly saying that the establishment of the Spanish Non-Intervention Committee is the most despicable act of deception by so-called great powers against small and weak nations, and it is also a conspiracy to put Britain and France at a disadvantage in future wars. Mussolini's desire for peace is nothing more than to allow his fellow dictators to have time to prepare. "I don't believe it. Please look at Mussolini's actions and arrangements, such as the deployment of a large number of troops to Libya, the invasion of Abyssinia, the incitement of unrest in Palestine, the construction of air force and submarine bases in the Balearic Islands and the Canary Islands, and the installation of German heavy artillery in Morocco to target Gibraltar. What is his purpose? It is very clear. Therefore, the position of the British Empire today, whether in the East or the West, is far worse than before." (28th National News Agency)</p>

<h3>The Non-Intervention Committee Reopened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Significant Progress May Be Made on the Issue of Withdrawing Volunteers</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee of the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee is scheduled to continue its meeting at 3 PM tomorrow. British Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Cranborne announced in the House of Commons today that, regarding the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers, all national representatives except the Soviet representative have now accepted the draft resolution prepared by the subcommittee. Even regarding the Soviet Union, they may change their attitude at tomorrow's meeting. Therefore, people generally believe that tomorrow's meeting will make significant progress on the issue of the withdrawal of volunteers. However, how the draft resolution should be revised to be accepted by the Soviet Union will inevitably cause Guiping's trouble, so that the work of the subcommittee will still be watched before next week for tangible results. British observers at all levels said that the subcommittee may draft a kind of "agreement in principle." At that time, after the large-scale withdrawal of foreign volunteers, recognizing both parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerent groups will naturally be discussed. However, the definition of "large-scale withdrawal" is the main difficulty. (28th Havas dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>

He said that Wauchope took this position in 1931 and took sick leave in September this year to return to England for recuperation. He originally planned to return to his post in mid-November, but now he feels that his health has not recovered and he cannot continue to hold this difficult position for a long time. He has served for six years and has been loyal and diligent in his duties under extremely difficult circumstances, resulting in accumulated overwork and illness. The government deeply admires him for this. (29th Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Political figures here were extremely surprised to hear the news of Wauchope's resignation, because it was a time of great difficulty. These people are deeply afraid that Wauchope's resignation will make extreme elements in Palestine even more active. According to the "Daily Mail," it is speculated that after Wauchope's resignation, he will be succeeded by the former commander-in-chief of the British Army in India, Chetwode, or the Governor of Bengal, India, Anderson.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Political Work Under the Threat of Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>In this war, the main areas of activity of the enemy air force are mostly not on the battlefield, but in prosperous cities and towns lacking air defense facilities. For example, Songjiang City is quite far from the war zone, but the bombing disasters it has suffered in recent days have not been reduced compared to the front lines of the battlefield. In just one instance yesterday morning, enemy aircraft dropped more than 130 bombs, targeting mostly bustling markets and peaceful citizens. This inhumane and brutal act only makes our compatriots more aware of the true face of the enemy. Militarily, it is simply meaningless.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, for the sake of the future of our resistance, we cannot simply let these disasters run their course. We must actively work on prevention beforehand and relief afterward. We must also pay attention to the wartime organization of the people, so that local order is not affected in the slightest by the enemy aircraft's rampage. Regarding the specific direction of this effort, I now put forward two points, hoping that military and political authorities and leaders from all walks of life will consider them.</p>
<p>First, in all areas suffering from air raids, military and political authorities and enlightened people from the community should actively utilize the baojia system, ensuring that all residents, regardless of gender or age, are closely organized to automatically undertake all work adapted to wartime needs, such as air defense, digging trenches, rescue, transportation, eliminating traitors, production cooperation, and consumer cooperation.</p>
<p>Second, the government should quickly find ways to ensure that the poor people who have suffered from the war can continue to maintain a minimum standard of living. Regarding this point, the most effective methods, in addition to setting up shelters, are work relief and opening up immigration areas.</p>

<h3>The Responsibility of Americans in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>— Kung Sung Ai-ling</p>
<p>Madame Soong Ai-ling Kung, wife of Minister of Finance H.H. Kung, broadcasted a speech yesterday morning at the Jinling Radio Station, offering many suggestions regarding the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Brussels. The wording was earnest. The following is a special translation:</p>
<p>Good morning, listeners. I am speaking to you at this moment from Shanghai, China. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak with you and wish you well, because America is like my second hometown. I studied in your country, and I know and yearn for many people in your country. In addition to personal friendship, your country is also a friendly country with similar traditions to my country. Your country deeply knows that Japan's military aggression against China is ferocious, dangerous, and destructive of humanity, not only endangering the survival of my country, but also threatening world peace.</p>
<p>After the last World War, the world thought that the future world peace could be guaranteed by concluding treaties and conventions. The peace of my country has become more secure due to the conclusion of the Nine-Power Treaty, as if there were strong windows, and thieves could hardly enter the house. However, even if there are strong windows, if the police disarm or pay less attention, the thieves will use the technique of drilling holes and climbing over walls. The same is true for countries. Because the major powers were trapped in the world's economic downturn, they did not have time to look abroad. Japan took this opportunity to use its skills, because Japan suffered the least damage in the last World War. He watched the national strength of most countries decline, so he took advantage of the opportunity to devote all his efforts to strengthening his military and increasing his industrial production to seize the world market. He secretly worked hard to accumulate countless military equipment, which he used to invade Chinese territory.</p>
<p>In the eventful times of the world, Japan has made up its mind and made a fortune on the mainland of China. He has also made up his mind to expand a larger empire. He is truly an international thief, taking risks and taking chances, disregarding the world's condemnation, to seize the spoils he envisions. He is willing to do these things because he is confident that if the countries draw their swords to help each other because he trampled on international treaties, he is prepared to deal with them. Since the seizure of Manchuria on September 18, the countries have not stopped him, and he has become even more unscrupulous and unscrupulous.</p>
<p>The guarantees given to my country by the Nine-Power Treaty have been completely destroyed by Japan, so he has gone a step further, wanting to achieve his goals by violent means, so he has massively destroyed lives and property in my country. He feels that the international police cannot stop the behavior of international thieves.</p>
<p>However, Japan unexpectedly encountered an unexpected encounter this time. What he could not have dreamed of was the Chinese resistance, and it was an unprecedented resistance, a resistance with both wisdom and courage. In this resistance, China has revealed two facts. First, China is not cowardly. The second fact is even more important, that Japan is not invincible. Although we have suffered setbacks, a previous misconception of the world has been swept away. Now the great powers can all ask themselves, "Why should we be afraid to force all countries to respect treaties in order to preserve the survival of mankind?" In fact, this kind of fear should not exist in the first place. If the world still harbors this fear, then the future of the world is indeed very dark.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, you will definitely ask me how to achieve peace. I say that there are many peace tasks that you can do. If you want peace, you must have the courage to engage in peace work. Otherwise, even if you shout loudly for peace, neutrality, and isolation, the god of war may suddenly come without choosing a day.</p>
<p>So how can you help China stop Japanese aggression and maintain peace in the Far East in accordance with the conditions of the Nine-Power Treaty? I think your country does not need to join the war. We do not ask your country to join us in fighting. In addition to participating in the war, your country can help us in many effective ways. We are grateful for your country's sympathy and spiritual assistance to us, but we still need your country's help, that is, within the possible range, we hope that your country will provide more material assistance. If your country is unwilling, it is tantamount to helping Japan to destroy our country. We need military weapons and ammunition. We need to relieve millions of homeless women and children and tens of thousands of wounded soldiers and civilians who are not protected by treaties. At the same time, we hope that your country will cooperate with us not to supply money to Japan in order to prolong the time of aggression. As long as your country's citizens do not do business with Japan, all military weapons and ammunition and goods indirectly related to the war will not be transported to Japan to avoid prolonging the war and killing peace-loving civilians in China.</p>
<p>We believe that no matter how stubborn Japan is, it will never be able to defeat the world's justice. Indeed, hasn't it been eleven weeks since the start of the war in Shanghai? We have long known that they are nothing more than that. Do you know that our country's troops are not prepared and that the substance of the weapons is old? However, in these eleven weeks, our troops have used flesh and blood to resist the cruel slaughter of the Japanese army equipped with the latest weapons. When blood and flesh can still resist, we have never stopped. You can know that if the world's powers really want to force Japan to abandon its militaristic policy, it is actually very easy.</p>
<p>You probably also know that the countries of the world will soon meet in Brussels in Beijing to promote the Nine-Power Treaty to find a peaceful solution to the Sino-Japanese situation. So now is a very good time. May I ask what your country's attitude towards this meeting is and what steps will be taken in the future to support this Nine-Power Treaty with our country? Japan has deceived the countries of the world. Now he is using his deceptive means again. When he invaded China's three northeastern provinces, didn't he say that he never wanted China's territory? However, now he is invading the mainland of China. In the three northeastern provinces, he established a puppet government, and now he is busy establishing another puppet government in North China and Inner Mongolia to manage the area of North China. No matter how Japan propagandizes that the puppet government is independent, his troops and advisors have supreme authority in the puppet government. May I ask whether your country and other countries can allow him to deceive and not point out straightforwardly?</p>
<p>Our people are extremely concerned about the attitude taken by your country at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, because your country can do everything in the world. Will your country take active measures to respect the treaty, or will it take a vague policy to avoid right and wrong? We are very anxious about this, because the invasion of the three northeastern provinces by Japan has proved that the League of Nations is nominal, resulting in countless changes in the world, and China is afraid that it will be sacrificed again. Countless small and weak nations will inevitably be disappointed with the dignity of this League of Nations, and these many small and weak nations are anxiously watching your country, because they lack leaders, and because they are waiting and watching whether the world can abide by all future treaties. All those who abide by the treaty are now suspicious whether the days of peace will never come again. Everyone in their eyes thinks that your country must be the righteous speaker for the weak and the oppressed, and they can imagine his brave and invincible maintenance of and non-implementation of treaties, and cannot allow one nation to be threatened and slaughtered by another nation, just as today China is suffering from Japan's brutal behavior. The Beijing Conference can restore the dignity of treaties, but it can also make treaties equal to waste paper. Peace can be guaranteed or further destroyed. The great powers all have great responsibilities, and whether world culture is sacrificed, and whether the bloody tragedy in China that Japan is talking about in today's broadcast will be continued in other countries in the future, is all in the hands of this conference.</p>
<p>Our ideal is that your country should not have any other policy in today's position, except to work hard with the great powers to take the same simple steps, so that this kind of uncivilized thing that is not suitable for the age will never happen again. We also think that your country will be able to make all nations have faith in abiding by treaties, and it will be able to lead all countries with a firm and courageous attitude, so that the pain that China is suffering now will never be seen again. It must be implemented now to be effective, and it cannot be shirked by empty words. We cannot deceive ourselves with intelligence, nor can we deceive others with intelligence. We must have courage, especially honesty. If your country and other great powers do not take a firm approach at this Beijing Conference, then the conference will inevitably be the most unconscious conference of world politicians in world history, and the peace, humanity and democracy of the world will never be seen again.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Department Promotes a Campaign to Raise Funds for Winter Clothing by Various Groups</h3>
<p>People Who Donate Winter Clothing Will Be Awarded Certificates Separately The Number of Clothing to Be Made Depends on the Circumstances of the Provinces and Cities</p>
<p>Because the soldiers fighting on the front lines are thinly clothed, the Municipal Party Department is now actively promoting a campaign to raise funds for winter clothing by national salvation groups in the city. The central government has stipulated ten measures for raising funds for winter clothing to comfort the soldiers on the front lines and ordered the party and government organs of various provinces and cities to comply. The ten measures are listed below: ㊀ Party and government authorities in provinces and cities should supervise lower-level organs in counties and cities to promote large-scale winter clothing fundraising campaigns by national salvation groups (such as anti-enemy support associations and relief associations). ㊁ The types of winter clothing to be raised should be based on the raw materials produced in each locality and can be divided into three types: leather, cotton, and silk cotton. ㊂ The size of the winter clothing must be handled in accordance with the regulations of the military organs. ㊃ The number of winter clothing to be raised should be determined by the highest party and government authorities in accordance with the standard of the number of imports and exports and the wealth of the land in each province and city. ㊄ If people in various provinces and cities donate raw materials or donate money and specify that winter clothing should be purchased, the local party and government authorities may promote textile and sewing workers and housewives to manufacture it. ㊅ People who donate 500 pieces of winter clothing per person will be given a certificate of thanks by the local government. Those who donate 1,000 pieces will be presented to the provincial government by the local government for a clear order of commendation. Those who donate 10,000 pieces will be specially awarded by the National Government. ㊆ Local party and government organs that have made excellent achievements in fundraising will be rewarded by their superior organs and will be used as one of the important evaluations. ㊇ Local organs, groups, and public officials must first respond to the call to set an example. ㊈ The winter clothing fundraising matters in various localities should be completed in the shortest possible time, and government organs should regard them as important political affairs and should not be delayed. ㊉ The winter clothing collected in various localities should be sent to the provincial and municipal authorities in the fastest possible way for consolidated planning and distribution.</p>
<h3>Japan Has Not Allowed Countries to Retrieve Goods</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of foreign merchants in this city going to Hongkou, Yangshupu, and Huishan districts to retrieve the goods stored in their warehouses, Mr. Barentzen, the German Acting Consul-General in Shanghai, proposed the other day and invited the Consuls-General of Britain, the United States, and France stationed in Shanghai to go to the Japanese Consulate-General to negotiate this case with the Japanese Consul-General. After discussion, the Japanese Consul-General did not give a firm answer of permission, but said that this matter must be considered by the Japanese army and navy before a formal reply can be given.</p>
<h3>British Soldiers Recount Rescuing Refugees</h3>
<p>A Woman's Children Were All Killed Weeping Bitterly on the Iron Bridge</p>
<p>The China Press reported that the brave men in the two defense posts of British soldiers near the Kasfei Railway Bridge told a China Press reporter yesterday that when the Chinese army made a general retreat on Wednesday, they rescued 30 wounded Chinese refugees on the railway bridge under heavy gunfire. The refugees were advancing along the railway and were caught in the crossfire of the Chinese and Japanese soldiers' machine guns on the bridge. The situation was very dangerous. Therefore, they crawled forward and rescued the refugees to a safe location and transported them to the hospital in the concession by British military trucks. When the reporter asked for details, the brave man answered shyly, because he rescued the victims out of conscience. His chivalry is very commendable. Yesterday afternoon, a small group of British soldiers saw a Chinese woman on the side of the railway bridge, looking panicked and trembling, walking on the damaged bridge, almost unable to take a step. The crowd urged her to move forward quickly because the woman was right in the middle of the Chinese and Japanese positions, but the woman could not move quickly. When she reached the end of the bridge, she burst into tears to the crowd, because all three of her children had been killed. The crowd was heartbroken when they saw this situation. Alas, how many more people like this woman are there? Mayor Yu of this city expressed his sincere gratitude to the British, American, and Italian soldiers for their courageous and righteous actions in helping to rescue the refugees who poured into the Public Concession on Tuesday and Wednesday, and for providing initial assistance to the wounded.</p>
<h3>Closely Monitor the Influx of Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>Joint Association Notifies All Manufacturers</p>
<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Joint Association, recently noting the resurgence of activities involving Japanese goods by unscrupulous merchants who have lost all sense of conscience and shame, yesterday issued a special notice to its member manufacturers, urging them to closely monitor enemy goods and prevent them from being disguised. The notice stated that since the Japanese invasion of Shanghai has lasted for more than two months, all sectors have resolutely severed economic ties with the enemy. However, the brutal enemy, while bombing and slaughtering our people, is exploiting unscrupulous profiteering merchants to disguise Japanese goods as domestic products and sell them everywhere. At this critical juncture for the nation's survival and the fate of our people, all citizens with a sense of conscience should advocate using domestic products to strengthen national wealth and empower the people. The association fears that member manufacturers may be deceived, so it is issuing this special notice to all businesses, urging them to pay close attention and refuse to sell any disguised goods. It is hoped that they will not disregard this notice. The association is also printing and distributing a public letter, advising everyone to carefully examine goods when purchasing them to avoid being deceived.</p>
<h3>Find Ways to Facilitate Factory Production</h3>
<p>Planning Bureau Instructs the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday received instructions from the Bureau of Social Affairs, stating that during this period of all-out resistance, all public and private factories, large and small, should increase production as much as possible and should not stop work unless absolutely necessary, in order to benefit both military and civilian needs. Previous orders from the ministry have already instructed the chamber to relay these instructions to all its members for compliance. Subsequently, the chamber reported the difficulties faced by factories in the city in resuming operations to the bureau, which then forwarded the report to the relevant authorities. Now, Instruction No. 21566 from the Ministry of Industries states that the submission has been noted and that the Ministry has already requested the First Department of the Military Affairs Commission to instruct all relevant agencies and troops to protect factories, find ways to resolve the mentioned difficulties, and facilitate factory production. The instructions were to be relayed for notification. Therefore, the chamber is hereby instructed to notify its members accordingly.</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Returns to Nanjing Yesterday After Recovering from Injuries Sustained in Car Accident</h3>
<p>Ignoring Pain After Injury, She Still Personally Went to the Front Lines to Boost Morale</p>
<p>Madame Soong Mei-ling, wife of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 23rd of this month to inspect the front lines and慰劳 the soldiers. She was accompanied by advisor Donald and one military officer, traveling in a single car. At 4:30 PM that afternoon, while traveling not far from Shanghai, the rear tire of the car suddenly burst. The car was traveling at a considerable speed, causing it to overturn into a ditch by the side of the road. Madame Chiang was violently thrown out of the car, landing fourteen feet away. She immediately lost consciousness. Donald and the officer were also thrown from the car but were not injured. They rescued Madame Chiang and took her to a nearby farmhouse. She regained consciousness after about fifteen minutes. Ignoring her injuries, Madame Chiang insisted on completing her mission to the front lines. After arriving, she inspected the front lines for about an hour before returning to Shanghai at 11:00 PM, six and a half hours after the accident. She immediately consulted a doctor and had an X-ray taken the next day, which revealed a fractured rib. After proper treatment, she has now recovered. Madame Chiang returned safely to Nanjing yesterday. According to Donald, if Madame Chiang had been thrown to the other side of the road, her life would have been in danger, as a car was speeding past at that moment. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, enemy planes have been bombing and strafing the Nanjing-Shanghai highway and railway almost daily. The British Ambassador was also wounded in an attack. Therefore, those traveling on the Nanjing-Shanghai road usually do so at night. Madame Chiang, undeterred by hardship and danger, traveled to the front lines during the day. Her fearless and courageous spirit is truly admirable. Even after the accident and injury, she insisted on completing her great mission, demonstrating her loyalty to the country and devotion to the public, which is highly commendable.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Madame Chiang, wife of Chairman Chiang, returned safely to the capital this afternoon with advisor Donald. Several days ago, while traveling by car from Nanjing to Shanghai along the Nanjing-Shanghai Road, the rear tire of the car exploded, causing it to overturn into a ditch. Madame Chiang was thrown fourteen feet and remained unconscious for fifteen minutes. After examination by her doctor in Shanghai, it was determined that she suffered from shock and a strained muscle. Donald and one military officer were in the car with her that day. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>Foreign Residents in Western Shanghai Rush to Evacuate</h3>
<p>After the front lines shifted, the situation in the Shanghai western extra-settlement road area became tense. The sound of gunfire and cannons filled the air day and night, and stray bullets flew everywhere. British Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Philips, immediately issued a notice, fearing that the war would expand and affect residents, advising Westerners to evacuate if necessary to avoid danger. Since yesterday (29th), Western residents living along Yih Ting Pan Road, Great Western Road, Yu Yuan Road, Route Tenant de May, and Route de Ghisenghien in western Shanghai have been rushing to evacuate. Suitcases and luggage filled the roads, one after another. Garrison troops, together with police officers, were on hand to take care of everything, so order was maintained.</p>

<h3>"North China Daily News" Reporter Inspects the Zhabei War Zone</h3>
<p>A Scorched Earth, Beyond Description - Chinese Troops Took Everything With Them When They Withdrew</p>
<p>The "North China Daily News" published an article yesterday detailing the destruction observed by its reporter while touring the war zone in Zhabei. The main points are that the North Railway Station was the main target of the Japanese army's land and air bombardment, lasting for 75 days. The amount of ammunition used by heavy artillery and heavy bombers was incredibly enormous. Now, the Japanese flag flies high over the two railway bureaus, indicating the great victory of the Japanese army. However, Zhabei has become a scorched earth, and the scene of destruction is almost indescribable. The traces of artillery shells and bombs are everywhere. Looking around, it resembles the aftermath of an earthquake. The main feeling at this time is not about the withdrawal of the Chinese troops on Tuesday night, but how the Chinese troops were able to hold on for so long under such heavy pressure from the Japanese army. The Chinese army's defenses were extremely thorough and cleverly constructed, which explains why the Japanese army found it so difficult to attack and had to resort to even more severe measures in addition to street fighting. The article concluded by saying that the reporter did not see any abandoned war materiel or military supplies in the area he inspected. This proves that when the Chinese troops withdrew, they took everything of value with them, regardless of size.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Attack German Nationals</h3>
<p>Japanese Consulate Has Apologized to Settle the Matter</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 24th of this month, when enemy planes machine-gunned British troops on Route Ghisenghien, two German nationals traveling there were also affected. Japanese Consul-General Okamoto not only verbally apologized to German Consul-General Dr. Trautmann but also officially sent a letter of apology on behalf of his government. He also guaranteed that similar incidents would not occur in the future and was willing to compensate the victims for all losses. The German authorities were satisfied, so the case has been resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<h3>Indian Trade Union Federation Expresses Outrage at Japanese Atrocities</h3>

<h3>Jincheng Shelter Establishes Printing Workshop</h3>
<p>Accepts Commissioned Printing Work, Women Substitute for Sewing Clothes</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, in view of the fact that the displaced refugees are idle and eating without working all day long, and that if this continues, not only will financial and material resources be consumed, but eventually, it will become habitual, and strong and useful bodies will become dependent and lazy people, which will have a great impact on the country, society, and their own future. Now, it is planned to set up small workshops in the shelters, select refugees with skilled craftsmanship, and provide them with light work to generate income and avoid idleness. It is reported that the association's Jincheng shelter has now set up three printing presses and established a printing workshop. The workers are all refugees with printing experience selected from various shelters. The prices are low, and the delivery is fast. All of the association's printed materials are printed by this workshop, and the results are good. The workshop is currently located in the Jincheng Shelter of the Xia Ling Peck Cinema at 742 Jing'an Temple Road. All sectors can go there to negotiate if they have commissioned printing work, which is also a way to help the refugees. It is also reported that the association also provides six of the shelter with work such as sewing padded vests and clothing for injured soldiers and refugees.</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Service Corps Reorganized and Ready</h3>

Their spirit of service is deeply admired by people from all walks of life in Shanghai, both Chinese and foreign. It is now learned that the council has followed the instructions of the China Boy Scout General Association and reorganized the existing service corps into the China Boy Scout Wartime Service First Corps. The reorganization has now been completed, and they will continue to participate in various wartime service activities, and reissue green armbands to maintain military appearance. Anyone without an armband is not allowed to wear the Boy Scout uniform.</p>

<p>The International Transport Workers' Federation is one of the world's most famous labor organizations and has considerable authority. The Chinese Seamen's Union, as a member state of the federation, specifically requests that the Belgian branch be notified to gather local workers at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and request the conference to resolve to impose effective sanctions against the brutal Japan, in order to attract the attention of the representatives of all countries. Furthermore, the San Francisco Seamen's Area Council in the United States led its affiliated seamen and dockworkers in a parade and demonstration on the 27th of this month when a Japanese mail ship arrived, implementing a boycott of Japanese goods. The union also sent a telegram of support. The two telegrams sent by the union are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram 1</p>
<p>"To the International Transport Workers' Federation, The brutal Japan, in order to realize its aggressive ambitions, has spared no effort to destroy human peace and has launched a large-scale invasion against us. The union trusts that the Federation is fully aware of all the atrocities committed in China, as detailed in the union's previous telegram. As the signatory nations to the Nine-Power Treaty are holding a conference in Belgium, which is about to open, the Federation hopes that the members will come to an agreement for severe, effective, methods of sanction against Japan. This would diminish the human tragedy, it may even be invisible. However, if Japan's ambitions continue today, then the Chinese people will have no choice but to defend themselves and their survival, vowing to shed their last drop of blood to deal with them and ensure that they do not return with a single piece of armor. Only, we respect peace, and strictly abide by the convention and have long admired your union's justice. A strong voice will reverberate through the mountains. The union is reaching out to you to be informed in time for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. Enlist the local workers for demonstration movement, in order to give a warning for countries with wild ambitions. And to prompt the attention of the representatives of each country to take swift, effective, sanctions against the brutal Japan, not only for world peace, but the people of all countries have not stopped wishing, the union sent this telegram, and wish for progress, Chinese Kuomintang Central Supervisory Committee, Shanghai Garrison Commander and Chinese Seamen's Union Special Envoy, Army Lieutenant General Yang Hu and all the national seamen kowtow."</p>
<p>Telegram 2</p>
<p>"To the San Francisco Seamen's Union and San Francisco Area Council in the United States, it has been known that your union are implementing a boycott of Japanese goods, to show the industrial sectors opposition of brutal Japan’s barbaric behavior towards China’s aggression. All of the national seamen deeply admire. The union hopes your steadfast advocacy can expand its boycott of Japan movement to cut off all economic ties and eliminate the international bandits invasion roots and to maintain world peace. Sincerely hope, Chinese Seamen's Union Special Envoy Yang Hu leads national seamen."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Editors Association Declaration Demands Severance of Relations with Japan</h3>
<p>Strengthen the External Expression of the Power of Non-Compromise, Fight for the Only Task of the Final Victory of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Editors Association issued a declaration for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, demanding sanctions against Japan and severance of relations with Japan. The original text is as follows: "Dear elders, brothers, sisters, fellow countrymen, while our heroic soldiers on the front lines are defending the motherland with their blood and flesh, and while fierce battles against Japan are unfolding in the south and north, we deeply feel that the international community's understanding of our determination for this long-term, all-out war of resistance has not yet reached a thorough stage. The fact that the Sino-Japanese issue is still filled with an atmosphere of mediation on the eve of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is the best evidence. We know that the United Kingdom and the United States, one being the most powerful manipulator in the League of Nations and the other being the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty, the British authorities have repeatedly stated that the task of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference is "mediation rather than punishment," and the United States has also stated that the purpose of this conference is primarily mediation. Even the United Kingdom suspects that "China may not be able to resist for so long and there will be no end in sight." This is still a major danger in the international community's view of our long-term war of resistance, and it is also a crisis that we should immediately overcome in our all-out war of resistance today. We want to solemnly inform the friendly countries of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference that our sacred national self-defense war, united by the whole country, is not only for the independence, freedom, and liberation of the Chinese nation, but also to safeguard the dignity of the League of Nations Covenant and the Nine-Power Treaty, and at the same time, it is also for the sake of world peace. Therefore, we accept participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in order to demand that all peace-loving countries give collective sanctions and stern punishment to the greatest culprit of disrupting world peace - Japanese imperialism. We oppose any mediation that infringes upon our territorial sovereignty, independence, and integrity. We especially oppose the Nine-Power Treaty Conference becoming a spoils-sharing conference for dividing China. At the same time, we also oppose the possibility of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference becoming the second non-interference committee on the Spanish issue. We believe in our government's determination to resist until the end, but in order to make people all over the world thoroughly understand our determination for self-defense war, to make those who advocate mediation in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have no excuse, and to prevent the attempts of the smallest number of people in our country who seek to steal peace and compromise, we demand the immediate implementation of the severance of relations with Japan and the recall of all personnel from the embassy in Japan. We believe that only in this way can we strengthen the government's power to express non-compromise to the outside world, and it is precisely our only task to overcome the current crisis and strive for the victory after the war of resistance. Compatriots across the country, let us rise up, we must work together to demand sanctions against Japan and severance of relations with Japan from the Nine-Power Treaty Conference!"</p>
<h3>Foreign Far East Shipping Lines Still Finding it Difficult to Resume Sailing</h3>
<p>Insurance Companies Refuse to Cover War Risk Insurance; All Parties Directly and Indirectly Suffer Losses</p>
<p>After the Shanghai battle, British and American Far East liners, such as those belonging to the Jardine Matheson and American President Lines, immediately suspended sailings to Shanghai. It has now been more than two months, and the direct and indirect losses suffered by the United Kingdom and the United States are enormous. In addition to the losses of these companies, British and American exporters' goods cannot be shipped to China, and at the same time, various Chinese products cannot be shipped out. It is difficult to accurately calculate the total losses. According to what this reporter learned yesterday, although the shipping companies intend to find ways to resume sailings, as a matter of prudence, they must purchase war risk insurance. However, since the outbreak of the war, insurance companies have generally refused to underwrite war risk insurance, so Far East shipping lines will temporarily still find it difficult to resume sailings.</p>
<h3>Letters of Thanks from Various Groups to the British Army for Saving Refugees</h3>
<p>The Spirit of Benevolence and Chivalry Will Forever Be Engraved in the Hearts of Our Compatriots</p>
<p>The British Army stationed in Shanghai has provided much assistance in the work of rescuing refugees during our country's war of resistance. Especially on the 27th of this month, when groups of refugees from Zhabei sought refuge in the Shanghai Western District concession, the British troops stationed there all rose up to help. The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association sent a letter of thanks yesterday. The original letter was in English, and is translated as follows: To His Excellency Major General Smelly, Commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, in recent days, the scene of our Zhabei citizens, unable to bear the slaughter of the brutal Japanese army, supporting the old and carrying the young, fleeing to the Shanghai Western District concession, was extremely tragic and indescribable. At that time, the soldiers of your army, moved by righteous indignation, bravely assisted, supporting the old and weak, and guiding the young, so that they were able to cross the danger and enter safety, preserving their lives. This spirit of benevolence and chivalry will be forever engraved in the hearts of our compatriots. We hereby respectfully send this letter to express our gratitude, and please convey our heartfelt thanks to all the soldiers on the scene. With respectful regards, Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association. The Shanghai Local Association, learning that refugees in the Shanghai Western District were supporting the old and carrying the young, with nowhere to flee, and that the British Army stationed in the area had automatically provided assistance, carrying them on their shoulders and in their arms to safe areas, found their enthusiasm extremely admirable. The chairman of the Shanghai Local Association, Mr. Du Yuesheng, on behalf of all the citizens, sent a letter to the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army stationed in the area, expressing his gratitude. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the British Defense Commander in Shanghai, saying, "We are writing to inform you that your command has provided great assistance to the people in the Shanghai Western District war zone who have fled into the concession, enabling the majority of these people to escape from danger. The Chamber of Commerce is extremely grateful for this spirit of chivalry and hereby expresses its thanks in a brief letter. We hope you will take note of this. To the British Defense Commander in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade Report</h3>
<p>Yesterday a Fire Broke out at the Toyoda Cotton Mill; Twelve Fire Alarms the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council received a report at 4:30 p.m. yesterday stating that the Toyoda Cotton Mill in the British defense zone was on fire and burning, and that shrapnel had fallen in the Bailinan Road area of the defense zone.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 28th), the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade lookout tower reported twelve fire alarms. The ambulance was dispatched nineteen times. A total of twenty-five patients were transported to various hospitals, sixteen of whom were injured by stray bullets or shrapnel, fourteen from the Western District and two from the Northern District. Fire trucks were called out four times.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from the War Zone (1)</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>"Going to the front line is not like being in Shanghai; you must listen to me. Drivers, pay attention to communication, but do not turn on your headlights indiscriminately. Lookouts, pay attention to airplanes and be careful not to lose anything on the truck. Whoever goofs off will let down his parents!" A former adjutant, who was escorting a large number of military supplies and was about to return to the front line, scanned the drivers standing around him with a bright flashlight and said very simply.</p>
<p>"This is a national matter; of course, we will never goof off!" The drivers answered in unison. Several even puffed out their chests and raised their hands, showing their extraordinary excitement.</p>
<p>With a few "toot-toot-toots," this team of trucks loaded with military supplies rumbled off to the front line. The reporter's car accompanied them. Another adjutant, Mr. Chen Shaowu, rode with me. It is said that he was a member of a certain crack troops that had come from the interior. Last night, he came to Shanghai to purchase electrical wire. He was troubled that he had nowhere to inquire late at night, but happened to meet a worker from the telephone bureau, who gladly volunteered to act as a guide, running around to help him complete the matter. Today, he bought a notepad at a store on Avenue Joffre. Unexpectedly, the boss was a foreigner with a high nose and blue eyes. After learning that he was "fighting the foreign devils," the foreigner gave him some relief items unexpectedly, amidst awkward and stammering compliments.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen had heard that Shanghai was the most snobbish and unwelcoming place, but at this moment, he encountered people who sympathized with him everywhere. Even foreigners gave him an unforgettable encouragement, which made him extremely happy.</p>
<p>He also said that before they set off, they had all received ideological inoculations. In other words, those who usually suffered from "Japanophobia" or had a vague understanding of the meaning of the war of resistance were dismissed early to prevent the bad influence of "one rat dropping spoiling the whole pot of soup." Those who are now going to the front line to fight are all determined "not to return alive without recovering lost territory." The day before yesterday, they had just reinforced a certain place, and a death squad, regardless of heavy casualties, had stubbornly recaptured the key position of Zhujiazhai. This was a small demonstration of their pure and vigorous morale.</p>
<p>From his accent, the reporter could tell that he was from a certain province, where there was a popular saying, "Leave home empty-handed, return home with wealth." This saying was very active in the minds of the average soldier. But now, the brave soldiers of this unit, who had come from afar to fight the Japanese, had transformed and embraced the determination "not to return alive without recovering lost territory." This could not be said to be a guarantee that "final victory will surely belong to us."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen parted ways in the middle of the journey. The reporter looked around and suddenly felt that the dangerous place they had passed through earlier—the sound of enemy and our troops charging and machine-gunning in front, and the deafening sound of our artillery in the rear—had been three days ago. The sound of artillery had moved far forward without a doubt, which meant that we had won the counterattack. However, we know that the journey of "protracted war of resistance" is very long and cannot be completed by fighting a few battles casually. Therefore, we are not proud of this kind of small victory. Perhaps small failures that are expected are about to follow. We should be even more courageous and fight the enemy to the end. Only in this way can we be sure of ultimate and greatest success!</p>
<p>Military transport was frequent along the way, and the journey took a long time. It was late at night when we arrived at a certain place in the direction of XX. At that time, the fog and dew were thick, and the earth was vast like a sea. Adjutant Huang passed through a sentry line and telephoned Mr. Lu, the deputy director of a certain military headquarters, to arrange a meeting with the reporter. There were many comrades and coolies there. They were really afraid that their elder brother, Adjutant Huang, would freeze. Like ants carrying food, they unloaded the mountain of military supplies from the trucks in no time.</p>
<p>Looking at the time, it would soon be dawn, so I decided to sit in the car and wait for daybreak, but I fell asleep without realizing it. Suddenly, I was awakened by a strong electric light. It turned out that the Boy Scouts who were taking care of the wounded soldiers were afraid that enemy planes would come to "drop eggs" and advised us to hide the car in the dark of night. Some of the Boy Scouts even played the Volunteer Army March on their harmonicas. On this autumn night with a slanting moon and dewy dew, hearing this passionate and tragic song, I felt an indescribable feeling in my heart!</p>
<p>The next day's breakfast was hosted by Director Lu. During the conversation, the gentlemen at the table talked about anecdotes from the war:</p>
<p>The enemy troops on the Liuhang line, because they landed four times, were all severely attacked by our army, making it impossible for them to gain a foothold, and they jumped into the Crystal Palace one after another! At the same time, the range of the enemy's naval guns was only thirteen or fourteen kilometers, while the range of our newest heavy artillery exceeded the range of the enemy's guns. This was a major blow to the enemy's ships. However, our artillerymen were very careful with their shells, aiming again and again before firing. They really wanted to hit the target every time before they were willing to fire with a loud roar. Therefore, the enemy troops recently dared not peek at Liuhang again. This is why they are "scared at the mere mention of it."</p>
<p>On the eve of the outbreak of the war, our highest military leader had predicted the ratio of enemy to our casualties, saying that "the ratio in the initial battle would be 2:1," but judging from the actual deaths and injuries in Liuhang, the enemy's huge death rate must be at least three times that of ours. Moreover, our defending troops at the mouth of Liuhang often saw enemy ships full of coffins constantly transporting them out. This was especially true after the fierce battle at Wenzaobang. According to statistics, at least 50,000 coffins have been transported out since the start of the war on August 13. Moreover, these ashes are from the collective cremation of thousands of corpses, which were then placed in a small number of boxes to be transported back to deceive people's eyes, so the exact number of deaths is even more than this.</p>
<p>The enemy troops started the war without a just cause, and they were repeatedly defeated. Their fear of death increased day by day. It goes without saying that soldiers with shallow knowledge believe in thousand-stitched vests or wear small Buddha statues, vainly seeking immortality. But the officers who attacked Zadian last time even carried grotesque and mythological protective flags. They are really not afraid of making the world feel that their so-called glorious and dignified imperial army is nothing more than "monsters and freaks!" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Enemy Troops Run Rampant in Zhabei</h3>
<p>Committing Adultery, Rape, and Plunder with Impunity; A Batch of Women Were Burned Alive</p>
<p>According to workers who escaped from a certain flour mill on Yutong Road, after the enemy troops occupied Zhabei, they searched everywhere. Any young men who had not escaped were shot. Young women were all raped. Anyone who slightly resisted was shot to death. Moreover, they set fires everywhere and looted grain and money, so that the corpses of our people killed on the streets of Zhabei were everywhere to be seen. The brutal acts of the enemy troops were endless. The worker spoke with tears in his voice, and his grief was indescribable. It was also learned that after the enemy troops invaded Zhabei, they carried out a large-scale massacre of our innocent civilians. Even young children and the elderly were not spared. The cruelty was indescribable. What is even more infuriating is that the enemy troops escorted a batch of our women to the vicinity of the Macheng Road station the day before yesterday. First, they stripped off all their clothes, and then tied them up one by one with ropes, so that they could not move. Then, they poured kerosene all over their bodies and threw them into the fire to burn them. The cries shook the sky and the stench filled the air. Even in the border area of the Suzhou Creek, it could sometimes be smelled. The heartbreaking scene was unforgettable for us.</p>
<h3>Refugees in Shanghai's Western District Separately Resettled</h3>
<p>Lacking Clothes for Cold Weather; Donations Urgently Needed</p>
<p>Since the Zhabei front changed and our army moved to a strong defense line, the concession side did not allow refugees to enter. After several negotiations by various agencies and groups, there were no results. Yesterday, Nie Haifan, deputy director of the Accommodation Group of the Refugee Relief Association, under the instructions of Chairman Pan, along with Municipal Council members Feng Bingnan, Lu Bohong, and Du Yuesheng, used their hard work, fearless spirit, and enthusiastic efforts to negotiate repeatedly with the concession authorities using diplomatic means. Finally, the concession authorities agreed. Therefore, from the 27th to the 29th, tens of thousands of homeless war zone refugees from Caojiadu, Daxilu, Haig Road, and the railway area were separately and properly settled. The weather has been getting colder in recent days, and these refugees have mostly escaped alone, urgently needing clothes for warmth. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will generously donate.</p>
<h3>The Italian Soldier Killed by the Japanese Was Buried Yesterday</h3>
<p>Representatives from the United Kingdom and the United States Attended</p>
<p>Italian sailor Paituola was killed by enemy anti-aircraft shells in the defense area of Xiaoshadu Road a few days ago. Afterwards, the Italian military authorities protested to the Japanese side. The Japanese side has apologized to the Italian military authorities. The previous newspaper reported this. After the remains of the Italian soldier were moved to the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, technicians performed embalming surgery. At 2:15 p.m. yesterday, the remains were moved to the base on Jing'an Temple Road. The burial ceremony at 3:00 p.m. was similar to that of the British soldier who was killed on Kaixuan Road last time. Admiral Yarnell, Commander of the US Far East Naval Forces, Admiral Little, Commander of the British China Naval Forces, and representatives from the military and political authorities of various countries also attended at the time.</p>
<h3>There is Absolutely No Shortage of Food for the Citizens of Shanghai</h3>
<p>Rice and Grain Transportation Certificates Must be Registered with the Regulatory Committee</p>
<p>After our army strategically withdrew from Zhabei, transportation on the Suzhou Creek from Caojiadu to the New Garbage Bridge was obstructed. The reporter recently inquired with the Municipal Food Regulation Committee about the food reserves of Shanghai citizens. According to the person in charge, the city has a large amount of grain reserves, and the rice shops also have very large reserves, which can maintain more than two months of food supply. Moreover, inland river rice can still be transported to Shanghai through other routes, so there is absolutely no shortage of food for the citizens. Although a small number of rice merchants are taking the opportunity to raise prices, the committee, in addition to limiting prices from being arbitrarily exceeded, is also strictly preventing price increases. Once verified, it will be reported to the competent authorities for strict investigation.</p>
<p>After the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce was approved by the Commander-in-Chief to print and issue transportation certificates to facilitate the transportation of commercial goods, hundreds of applications are received daily from various trade associations. Because the Municipal Food Regulation Committee is already handling the registration procedures for the transportation of rice, flour, bran, miscellaneous grains, and other goods, those who apply for transportation certificates for the above-mentioned goods in the future must first register with the Regulatory Committee before they can be issued. The Chamber of Commerce has already sent separate letters to various food-related trade associations to follow this procedure.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Party Headquarters Will Broadcast a Speech Today</h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters of this city has scheduled Mr. Jiang Hao to give a speech on the Transportation Ministry's radio station at 4:30 p.m. today, entitled "The Organization of the Masses During Wartime." Citizens who are concerned about this issue should pay attention. The radio station's frequency is 1,300, call sign XOHC.</p>
<h3>The Cilian Association Pays Attention to the Nutrition of Child Refugees</h3>
<p>Providing Soybean Milk Daily to Improve Health</p>

<h3>Continued Hope for Donations of First Aid Kits</h3>
<p>In the all-out war of resistance, our troops are bravely fighting and astonishing the world, but since a certain party came to Shanghai to pick up 300,000 first aid kits, the various armies have felt a shortage in their application. It is still hoped that people from all walks of life will maintain their previous enthusiasm and donate generously. Places to receive first aid kits: Jingtuan Temple, Guling Road; Cotton Cloth Trade Association, Zhoujin Lane; East Chuo Trade Association, Shilu, Beijing Road; Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce; Shanghai慰劳委员会; Shanghai Local Association.</p>
<h3>Yu Qiaqing Hospital's Deposits Allocated to Wounded Soldiers' Hospital</h3>
<p>Designating Wang Xiaolai and Others to Handle</p>
<p>The Yu Qiaqing Hospital Preparatory Committee held its seventh preparatory committee meeting yesterday at the meeting place at 93 Guangdong Road. Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yaqin, Zhang Jiguang, Yu Qiaqing, and others attended. Wang Xiaolai chaired the meeting and Shen Wangyun recorded it. After the chairman reported, the discussion began. (1) Mr. Yu Qiaqing proposed that the funds deposited by the committee be allocated to the wounded soldiers' hospital in this port. It was resolved that Yu Lao's proposal was patriotic, loving the people, giving long life to others, and prolonging the world. The committee members admired it immensely. Therefore, the method was agreed as follows: A. When necessary, the deposited funds of more than 26,000 yuan will be added by Yu Lao to make up 30,000 yuan and allocated for the use of the wounded soldiers' hospital. B. Hospitals with excellent performance, complete equipment, and financial difficulties will be selectively lent to by the committee. C. The five committee members Wang Xiaolai, Jin Tingsun, Zhang Jiguang, Mao Heyuan, and Gu Yuqi are appointed to follow Yu Lao's instructions and decide on handling it at any time. D. In the future, these funds should be raised in full by the committee members to maintain the original plan.</p>
<h3>The International Relief Society Adds Two Accommodation Centers</h3>
<p>Salvation Armies from Various Countries are Working Hard to Rescue Refugees</p>
<p>Since our army moved back from Dachang, Jiangwan, Zhabei, and other places, farmers in the war zones of Jiangwan, Dachang, Nanxiang, and Zhenru all fled to the concession from Caojiadu in Shanghai's Western District, and the number was very large. The International Relief Society of this city specially dispatched staff and Salvation Armies from various countries, and borrowed six cars from the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to drive directly to Caojiadu for rescue. Yesterday, more than 2,000 people were rescued and placed in the three accommodation centers set up by the association, which were already full and could no longer accommodate them. The association is now actively trying to add two accommodation centers and has selected an open space on Xiaoshadu Road and Macau Road as the fourth accommodation center, and an open space on Yanping Road as the fifth accommodation center, and has hired workers to start building reed sheds. It is also learned that the association yesterday also sent rice, steamed buns, bread, etc. by car to Shanghai's Western District to distribute to the refugees to fill their hunger.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Students of Municipal Schools to Reclaim Tuition Fees Due to Non-Attendance</h3>
<p>As all schools in the city were preparing for the start of the semester, war broke out in the city, preventing normal school opening. The education authorities, considering the long-term war, decided students should not have their studies delayed, and stipulated temporary opening and enrollment measures. Now, most schools in the war zone have relocated to safer areas and reopened. Students who had pre-paid various fees before the war but were unable to attend classes have been permitted by the Social Affairs Bureau to reclaim their fees at the original payment locations with their receipts. However, for schools that entrusted the Municipal Bank of the city to collect tuition and construction fees, the bank requires a separate procedure before refunds can be issued. This has resulted in many families of students who did not enroll being unable to reclaim the fees they paid, causing them to travel back and forth in vain. After the Social Affairs Bureau learned of the situation, they negotiated a solution: all receipts stamped by the original school proving that the student did not attend classes will be refunded in full. Therefore, students who had pre-paid tuition and health fees to the Municipal Bank for municipal schools but did not enroll only need to request the original school to stamp their receipt as proof of non-attendance to reclaim the fees from the bank. Those who paid fees directly to the school can also reclaim them from the original school. If a reservation fee was paid but no tuition fee was collected, that reservation fee can also be reclaimed.</p>
<h3>Earnest Appeal of the First Special District Joint Association to Citizens on Four Points</h3>
<p>Maintain Perseverance and Composure, Hold Firm to a Proactive Attitude; Prolonged Resistance Requires Restricting Consumption in the Rear</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Joint Association, deeply concerned that citizens may misunderstand and believe rumors spread by traitors regarding the strategic retreat of our troops from Jiangwan and Zhabei as part of preparations for prolonged resistance and efforts to deplete the enemy's strength, earnestly appeals to citizens of all districts on four points: ㊀ Cope with abnormal situations like a patriotic citizen. ㊁ Constantly observe the surrounding environment for any traces of traitors and unscrupulous individuals, and report or earnestly correct any plotting of unlawful behavior. ㊂ If financially, mentally, or physically capable, participate in frontline or rear area support work to the greatest extent possible. ㊃ Everyone should deeply empathize with the soldiers fighting the enemy at the frontlines, and restrict all consumption in the rear to enable prolonged resistance and ensure the sustainability of individual livelihoods.</p>

<h3>Deployment of the Entire Frontline Completed, Our Second Line of Defense is Formidable</h3>
<p>Enemy Attempt to Forcibly Cross the Suzhou Creek on the Right Flank Repelled by Our Forces; Central Route from Jiangqiao to Xiaonanxiang Completes a Vertical Line; Enemy Forces Bombarding Guangfu Position on the Left Flank, No Change</p>
<p>This newspaper received a frontline report this afternoon stating that the central and right flank units of our army, after gradually retreating southwest, the right flank units had completely moved to the south bank of the Suzhou Creek by the night before last (the 28th), from the southern end of the Fanhuaidu Railway Bridge to the new position at Yaojiadu. The central route, in order to cover the orderly movement of the right flank units, was still distributed along the arc-shaped line in the northeast of Jiangqiao Town, Yinzai (north of the Jinghu Road), Luoyang Bridge, and Wujiafen. In the past two days, they have been strictly blocking the enemy's advance on this line. Now that the right flank position has been stabilized, it began to withdraw west before dawn this morning, retreating to the line between Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao Town, completing a vertical line. At this point, the positions of our central and right routes have been completely stabilized, forming a parallel line with the left flank position in the future to contend with the enemy to the end. From last night to this afternoon, the enemy only used aircraft and artillery to bombard our left flank, in the Guangfu Town to Chengqiao Town area, attempting to destroy our fortifications. However, their infantry did not dare to advance lightly, so there was no fierce battle on this line. On the front of Luoyang Bridge and Yinzai, the enemy forces launched a fierce attack in two directions from last night, one attacking Luoyang Bridge along the Nanda Highway and the other invading Yinzai along the Jinghu Railway. Each used more than ten tanks to cover a large number of cavalry and infantry, advancing in a roundabout way. Our army also concentrated artillery fire, densely shooting, destroying many of their tanks and blocking the enemy's advance. Our frontline troops also fought bravely in different directions, and after fierce fighting until dawn this morning, they were ordered to retreat to the line between Xiaonanxiang and Jiangshu Town, relying on fortifications to defend. Also, on the south bank of Yaojiadu to the line of Zhoujiaqiao, the enemy forces on the north bank, under the cover of their artillery, also advanced in two directions, attempting to cross the river, one using tanks as a vanguard from the Zhenbei Road, intending to forcibly cross the river at Majiazhai and Huangjiazhai, directly reaching Beixinjing, and the other also using tanks as a vanguard from Zhongshan Road, hoping to seize our Zhoujiaqiao. Our army fiercely attacked from the south bank, and although the enemy repeatedly tried to build bridges and forcibly cross the river, they were eventually blocked by our artillery fire and retreated after suffering losses. Also, near the military surface of Zhongshan Road on the north bank, the enemy forces set up heavy machine gun positions, frequently sweeping the civilians who had not withdrawn from the south bank. In order to retaliate, our army erected several mortars on the roof of the Toyota Yarn Factory and suddenly launched a dense attack on the machine gun position. The enemy could not escape in time and two machine guns were destroyed. After a hasty retreat, they used artillery to bombard the Toyota Yarn Factory, resulting in eleven shells hitting it, immediately catching fire and burning it down. However, our side was prepared and withdrew the mortars before the enemy artillery bombardment, so apart from the factory being destroyed by them, we suffered no losses. At the moment, the line is still facing each other across the river.</p>
<h3>Bloody Battle on Zhen Da Road This Morning</h3>
<p>Enemy Suffers More Than Four Hundred Casualties, Flees in Disarray; We Capture Five Small Steel Cannons and More Than Twenty Rifles</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1:00 PM on the 30th that a battle for position broke out again on Zhen Da Road at 3:30 AM this morning. The enemy used more than twenty tanks to cover 5,000 enemy soldiers, attacking south along the highway, from Xujiazhai Nanku to Jijiazhai, Panzhai, and Daijiazhai. The fire line was about two kilometers long. The two sides fought fiercely for three hours. At dawn, our army launched a frontal attack on the enemy from the highway, driving the enemy back. At the same time, the left and right flanks coordinated their advance, pressing the enemy into retreat. In this battle, the enemy suffered more than 400 casualties and we captured five small cannons and more than twenty rifles.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks Guangfu, Bombardment Continues</h3>
<p>Fortifications Slightly Damaged, Quickly Repaired; Our Army Charges North of Caowang Temple, Repelling the Enemy</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Guangfu reported at 10:00 AM on the 30th that the enemy's attack on Guangfu was increasingly urgent. From 2:00 AM to 6:00 PM yesterday, they bombarded continuously, firing more shells than at any time in the past ten days. Part of our fortifications were destroyed, but after our army repaired them under fire, they were quickly restored to their original condition. At about 2:00 PM, about several hundred enemy soldiers charged our right flank position, reaching as many as five times, but they were all repelled by us. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and we captured one prisoner.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Guangfu reported at 10:00 AM on the 30th that at 2:00 AM this morning, more than a hundred enemy soldiers, under the cover of artillery, attacked our Zhao Jiaqiao position north of Caowang Temple. Our army responded calmly and launched a trench charge, driving the enemy back before dawn.</p>
<h3>Our Position at Luoyang Bridge Moves West</h3>
<p>Forms a Straight Line from Xiaonanxiang to Jiangqiao</p>
<p>The Jiangqiao Town to Nanxiang position, especially the Luoyang Bridge section, was too prominent, which was extremely unfavorable militarily. Therefore, it was moved backward last night until before dawn this morning, so that it formed a vertical line with Xiaonanxiang and Jiangqiao Town to facilitate attack and defense coordination. The enemy was completely unaware when our army moved back. This morning, they were still bombarding fiercely, but there was absolutely no damage to our fortifications. Luoyang Bridge is a transportation route between Zhenru and Nanxiang, with a gravel road leading northeast to Dachang, which can be used by cars, tanks, and baggage. After the enemy occupies this place, it will undoubtedly serve as a transportation center.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Bombard the Toyota Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 1:00 PM on the 30th that the Toyota Yarn Factory facing the enemy forces west of Zhongshan Road on the south bank of the Suzhou Creek was originally built with strong fortifications, and our army is now stationed there, making it one of the important strongholds. Last night, the enemy forces concentrated mortar fire on the area, with more than ten shells hitting, destroying part of it and starting a fire that burned part of it. After we rearranged it, it was unusually strong.</p>
<h3>Our Army Strengthens Defenses on the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Two Enemy Planes Bomb Villages, Tragically Killing More Than Ten Civilians</p>
<p>The Pudong area has returned to calm after three violent artillery battles the night before last. Only sporadic machine gun fire could be heard from the enemy ships on the Huangpu River near the Qichang Wharf last night, as a precaution against our army's attack. Otherwise, the entire line passed in silence until dawn. Our army is now strengthening its defenses along the Huangpu River, and it will be extremely difficult for the enemy to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>Two enemy planes flew over Weijiazhai, east of Zhangjialou in Pudong, yesterday evening and dropped seven or eight heavy bombs, completely destroying more than thirty farmhouses in the entire village. Four or five men and women were killed on the spot, and six or seven men and women were crushed to death. Those injured include Yang Shunfa, Shen Ronggen, Fei Lu's, Fei Damei, Shen Ruiren, Shen Meilai, Fei Zilin, and Sun Jingen, totaling more than ten people.</p>
<h3>Stray Bullets Flying in the Western District of the Concession</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 29th) from 4:15 PM to 10:00 PM, the artillery battles were quite fierce near the British military defense zone in western Shanghai. Three soldiers of the British Royal Ulster Rifles were killed by bullets, and two were injured. Shrapnel fell at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yuyuan Road and near Bailinan Road. Seven shells flew into the Columbia Road area. One shell hit the house at 1475 Yuyuan Road, and another hit 415 Daxilu Road. Shells also exploded near the Suzhou Creek on Jessfield Road. Five shells flew into the section of Lujia Road near Haig Road.</p>
<h3>The Concession Consular Body's Defense Committee Convened to Discuss Concession Protection Issues</h3>
<p>Appointing the British Army Commander and the Director-General of the Municipal Council as Chief and Deputy Director, Responsible for Full Authority of Command</p>
<p>The Concession Consular Body's Defense Committee held a meeting yesterday at the Municipal Council Building on Jiangxi Road, attended by consuls from Britain, the United States, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and other countries. The meeting's content was to discuss protection issues within the western Shanghai and Weihaiwei Police Station areas. The Bureau decided to entrust the full authority for the defense of the concession to the Southern Army Commander Sima Yilai and the Director-General of the Municipal Council Fei Xindun as Chief and Deputy Director, responsible for command.</p>
<h3>Eight Hundred Isolated Soldiers Resolutely Fighting, Repelling the Enemy Twice This Morning</h3>
<p>Commander Xie Sends Letters to Division Commander Sun and Deputy Division Commander Feng, Saying That They Will Never Sacrifice Easily Before Achieving Their Mission</p>
<p>Our brave soldiers of the 88th Division's Xie Regiment and Yang Battalion, who have been holding the Sihang Warehouse at the Guangfu Road entrance on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek, have persisted for four days and four nights. Although the enemy has done everything they can and used every trick, they have not been able to harm our soldiers in the slightest, let alone our fortress. Starting at dawn this morning, countless Chinese and foreigners went to admire them, and the traffic on Xinzha Road was blocked. Reporters also arrived early in the morning and watched from across the river. They saw our national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth flying on the top of the Sihang Warehouse and the top of the Mainland Warehouse, making it even more brilliant. Our eight hundred soldiers were all safe in the warehouse, with calm attitudes. The surrounding fortifications were even more solid. On the south bank of the river and on the new Garbage Bridge, there were also more than a dozen foreign officers watching from the railings. The enemy forces were huddled in the Shanghang Bank warehouse on the western end, and more than a dozen enemy soldiers were lurking in the enemy fortifications, frequently firing scattered rifle bullets at our Sihang Warehouse. But our army calmly ignored them. Then the enemy continued with machine guns and box guns to provoke us. Only then did one or two of our soldiers push open the windows facing the river for a reconnaissance and quietly observe the changes in the enemy's forces. However, the enemy did not notice it. At about 11:00 AM, more than a dozen enemy soldiers suddenly crawled out of their fortifications, seemingly wanting to take the opportunity to launch a sneak attack. Unexpectedly, they were seen by our soldiers at the window, and as soon as the enemy took a step, they fired rifles. After only a few shots, the enemy fled in panic and hid in their fortifications, frantically firing machine guns at us, as if they were afraid of being chased by us. The scene of panic and loss of composure was laughable. Not long after, we saw the previous dozen or so enemy soldiers take off their uniforms and wipe sweat frequently with towels. Presumably, they were exhausted and covered in sweat after this performance. Afterwards, the enemy soldiers hid and did not come out, but instead fired rifles at the onlookers standing on the south bank, as if wanting to vent their shame and anger. Fortunately, no one was hit.</p>
<p>Hand Grenades Defeat Enemy Tanks</p>
<p>The enemy's several charges on the Sihang Warehouse all failed, and many were killed by our army. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy dared not advance further and slowly advanced several tanks from behind the sandbags they had placed. The isolated soldiers guarding the warehouse pretended not to see them. When the tanks advanced to a considerable distance, they suddenly concentrated and fiercely bombarded them with dozens of hand grenades. Seeing the situation was bad, the enemy fled in a panic. This morning, the enemy changed tactics again, gradually moving the sandbags placed on the west side of the Sihang Warehouse closer to the east, and the enemy soldiers lying behind the sandbags used a small grenade fired from a rifle to bombard the walls of the warehouse, and a hole was indeed broken. But our heroic isolated army used the hole to set up a building barrier gun. After a fierce counterattack, the enemy immediately hid behind the sandbags and dared not move, but only fired rifles aimlessly.</p>
<p>Enemy's Dawn Attack Collapses</p>
<p>Since dawn this morning, the enemy forces concentrated their firepower to attack our heroic isolated army. For a time, the sound of gunfire was unusually intense, but our army was exceptionally calm. When the enemy approached, they fiercely counterattacked with machine guns and hand grenades. The enemy could not escape and more than a dozen people fell to the ground after being shot. The remaining enemy soldiers also retreated in disarray to the Jiaotong Bank godown and defended themselves on the rooftops. Until about 7:00 AM, the sounds of machine guns and rifles from both sides were still firing at each other. However, our army's bullets were fired from above and often hit the enemy's vital points.</p>
<p>Repeated Attacks Still Fail</p>
<p>Since about 7:00 AM, the enemy forces gradually showed signs of being unable to withstand it, so they changed their strategy. One side attacked the rear of our army from the side of Wuzhen Road, but before they approached our station, they were shot down by machine gun bullets again. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy stopped attacking. At this point, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided. Later, at about 8:00 AM, two enemy planes suddenly flew to the sky above Wuzhen Road and circled around. Three minutes later, they fled east. At about 11:00 AM, the sound of gunfire broke out again. Our isolated army still responded calmly, and more than a dozen enemy soldiers were shot and killed.</p>
<p>Enemy Sets Up Steel Cannons to Bomb the Warehouse</p>
<p>Starting at 6:00 AM today, the enemy forces set up several small steel cannons on the Guoging Road side, preparing to bombard the Sihang Warehouse. However, the buildings in that area are all steel and concrete, and our army has piled up sandbags around them, so this action of the enemy will definitely not have any impact on our heroic isolated army.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency said that the eight hundred loyal and brave soldiers of our army in Zhabei, who are isolated and defending to the death, have won the admiration of Chinese and foreigners. It is learned that Commander Xie, who commands these eight hundred heroes, has now sent two more letters to Division Commander Sun and Deputy Commander Feng, saying that they will never sacrifice easily before completely accomplishing their mission. After the mission is completed, they will make a heroic sacrifice, which is extremely tragic, commendable, and tearful. Also, Division Commander Sun's letter to Mr. Du Yuesheng, expressing his gratitude for the donations of materials from all walks of life, is also extremely important. The three letters are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Commander Xie's Letter to Division Commander Sun</p>
<p>Division Commander, may this find you well,</p>
<p>Your subordinate, with the determination to sacrifice, respectfully follows your intentions and fights to the end. Before completely accomplishing the mission, I will never sacrifice easily. Success or death, I have carefully considered it. I will certainly not fail your intentions, seek temporary ease, mislead the country and the people, and fail your trust. All publicity and news from the outside world are transmitted from outside. Your subordinate has never made any requests or talks to the outside world at this time. Having the determination to die, I have no thoughts other than accomplishing the mission. The entire fortification, after three days and nights of construction, has reached the intended level. If the enemy attacks, they will certainly not succeed. According to the reports of the watchtowers, the results of the enemy's attack on the 27th resulted in more than eighty enemy deaths. Yesterday (the 28th) at around 6:00 AM, your subordinate personally sniped and killed two enemy soldiers, and the people in the concession watching applauded and cheered. Now your subordinate's aim is to make a heroic sacrifice after the mission is completed. I beg you to release your thoughts.</p>
<p>Your subordinate, Xie Jinyuan, respectfully, October 29, 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Commander Xie's Letter to Deputy Division Commander Feng</p>
<p>Deputy Division Commander, may this find you well,</p>
<p>Now your subordinate is determined to die for the country. Within the limited time, the mission will be achieved, and I will never retreat easily. Whether now or in the future, I will never make any plans to seek a moment of survival. The Division Commander and the country have treated your subordinate well, and I should work even harder to fight the Japanese pirates for a long time. Internally, we are actively strengthening closed fortifications. Everything has a detailed plan. Before your subordinate seeks sacrifice, the entire battalion of officers and soldiers will definitely ask the Japanese pirates for a considerable price. Please forward your subordinate's intention to the Division Commander, and I will not fail the mission.</p>
<p>Your subordinate, Jin Yuan, respectfully, October 29, 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Division Commander Sun's Letter to Chairman Du</p>
<p>Division Commander Sun Yuanliang's letter to Local Collaboration Association Chairman Du Yuesheng regarding thanks to all circles for donating goods reads:</p>
<p>Chairman Yue Sheng, great greetings,</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that people from all walks of life in Shanghai are comforting one regiment of our army who are defending Zhabei to the death, and the goods are very many. I am very grateful, but the goods are not only difficult to transport, but also do not meet the needs, and are too piled up, making them very easy to rot. Fighting against the war is the duty of soldiers. Success or death are originally not different paths. Please ask Mr. to convey to all circles that there is no need to donate. If it is difficult to decline, it is best to buy national salvation bonds, or donate cash, as pensions for national anti-Japanese sacrificed officers and soldiers, so as to avoid waste and be practical.</p>
<p>Sun Yuanliang, October 30.</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Sends Newspaper Reporters to Shanghai to Seek Contact with News Circles of Various Countries</h3>
<p>And to Investigate the International Situation in Shanghai; Enemy Increases Troops in Large Numbers, Attempting to Attack in Two Directions</p>
<p>According to reports: ㊀ In order to investigate the international situation in China and to win over the news circles of various countries in Shanghai, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has specifically sent more than 20 reporters from the Hochi Shimbun, etc., including Masao Konan, to Shanghai on the 27th of this month to carry out activities. They are now staying at the Donghe Foreign Firm on Peng Road and have established a joint office in the Cathay Hotel to engage in activities with diplomatic officials and naval and land officers of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, etc., and to contact news circles of various countries. ㊁ The enemy troops in the Dachang and Zhabei areas have been transferred to Yangshupu, Wusong Road, Jiaxing Road, and other places to rest, and the newly added 12th Division has taken over the defense of Dachang, and the 29th Brigade of the 3rd Division and the 10th Naval Landing Force have taken over the defense of Zhabei.</p>
<p>㊂ The enemy forces plan to attack Nanxiang on one side, directly to Kunshan, and to attack Zhenru fiercely on the other, advancing to Zhongshan Road, and decide to use a large number (reported to be about 70,000) of army, equipped with 70 machine guns, 75 tanks, and 21 heavy artillery pieces, to launch an attack. It is also learned that the attacking enemy army will issue three large cakes to each person, which can provide food for three days.</p>
<p>㊃ The enemy side continued to arrive with 11 warships yesterday afternoon, carrying approximately 40,000 enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>㊄ The enemy forces abandoned the fortifications in the area of Henan Road and Shuidian Road and arranged defensive positions as the second line of defense.</p>
<h3>The Tyrannical Japanese Can't Bear the Burden, Eagerly Willing to Cease Fire in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Will Concentrate All Efforts on North China; Our Country Will Never Fall for Their Trick</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 30th via the Central News Agency reported that according to reliable sources, Japan is now eagerly willing to cease fire in Shanghai. The Japanese warlords are also gradually becoming anxious and uneasy about Japan's huge burden in North China. It is widely believed that China will definitely not agree to a ceasefire in Shanghai, because this move will allow Japan to focus its efforts on North China. A member of a certain important country's parliament said to a Reuters reporter that he believed that Japan's consumption was very high and its strength was declining, and other countries were very happy about it. If Japan is aware of this, then the best opportunity for peace has arrived. As for China's amazing recovery power, it is well known. At the same time, military observers are paying close attention to the Sino-Japanese conflict, and now they are praising the Shanghai Chinese army's skillful retreat and the order of its alignment, and they believe that the Chinese army's new position is more solid than the old one, and it will be even more difficult for the Japanese army to break through it.</p>

<h3>Enemy Plane Attempts to Bomb Huiling</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reported that at 11:00 AM today (the 30th), an enemy plane flew to Xinhualonghua Huiling Middle School and dropped a bomb. The road surface in front of the middle school was destroyed, and the local utility pole was also blown off.</p>
<h3>The Presidents of Four Universities Telegraph the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, Urging the Adoption of Collective Measures</h3>
<p>Bombing Universities Destroys Culture; Threatens Peace and Should be Punished</p>
<p>Zhu Kezhen, President of Zhejiang University, jointly with Weng Zhirong, President of Shanghai Tongji University, Li Zhaohuan, President of Jiaotong University, and He Bingsong, President of Jinan University, etc., telegraphed the representatives of the countries party to the Nine-Power Treaty meeting in Beijing, requesting them to uphold justice and impose sanctions on Japan. The telegram has been sent. The original telegram stated: "We urgently plead (request the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to adopt strong and effective collective measures to stop Japan's aggression against China, and to punish Japan for destroying international law and treaties, deliberately bombing universities and other cultural centers, and threatening world peace and culture."</p>
<h3>Brief Comments</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Regarding the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet government commented that convening the conference to stop illegal and sinful adventurism is both clumsy and useless. On the contrary, if the countries directly involved can act in concert, that will be sufficient. This is a sharp and insightful comment. I am deeply disappointed by the various circumstances leading up to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference was originally scheduled for the 25th, then changed to the 30th, and then to November 3rd. The severity of the situation has reached a critical point, yet they deliberately delay and procrastinate. This is the first disappointment. Before the meeting even started, various countries declared their positions. One says to provide spiritual assistance, another says to condemn morally, and yet another says to mediate the Far East dispute using peaceful methods, fearing to offend the mad god of war and bring disaster upon themselves. This kind of fearful attitude determines that there will be no positive results. This is the second disappointment. Furthermore, looking at all kinds of conferences in recent years, which one has achieved unexpected effectiveness?</p>

<h3>The Front and the Rear (3)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Uncle Di</p>
<p>"So, the practical issue of mobilizing the masses is what worries all parties, both government and public. At the very first step of starting this work, some people are worried about the issue of leadership. This cannot be said to be a reef in the future." — Me.</p>
<p>"Leadership, I don't think it should be a problem!" Mr. Chen said excitedly. "This is a matter of life and death for the entire Chinese nation, an extremely dangerous situation! If, unfortunately, there is a military failure in the final stage! Looking at the current situation, if it really fails, the upper level will be the enemy's rule, and the lower level will be a large number of traitors. In addition, there will be a crowd of people living in complacency. Beyond that, there will be nothing else! At that time, may I ask, what leadership is there! What can be led!"</p>
<p>"The facts are indeed so. But what I said is also the actual situation recognized by all parties. The current urgent problem is: how to effectively mobilize the broad masses!" — Me.</p>
<p>"I think the masses should mobilize themselves! It seems unnecessary to first ask who will lead!" — Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>"That's right. At present, theoretical exploration is already sufficient; the most necessary thing is to do it practically. This approach must be effective; moreover, it must be accepted and trusted by all parties. According to the news we have received, various parties are already conceiving action plans for this approach." — Me.</p>
<p>"However, no matter what approach is taken, to achieve significant results, it must be integrated with the lives of the masses. Although some people may suspect this; but in fact, unless the concepts of loving the country and loving the nation are unified with their own interests, then the masses will not be mobilized." — Mr. Chen.</p>
<p>One of the gentlemen present, who had been listening attentively, roused himself from deep thought at this moment. He straightened his collar, nodded, and said: "Absolutely right! Absolutely right! This is the conclusion drawn from Mr. Chen's long-term work experience!"</p>
<p>The conversation had lasted for more than an hour and a half. The serious atmosphere relaxed slightly. We asked about Mr. Chen's health.</p>
<p>"Very good! Very good!" Mr. Chen replied with a smile; and his spirited complexion, together with his words, answered our question.</p>
<p>We also asked if his actions were restricted. He immediately declared:</p>
<p>"Everything is very free. There is nothing of that sort here."</p>
<p>Mr. Chen and the three colleagues from our newspaper each took several photos in turn. At the time of parting, he repeatedly exhorted:</p>
<p>"Today's conversation — today's conversation —." We keenly felt his boundless concern.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen probably didn't want his conversation to be misconstrued as violating the various highest principles that the whole of China has tacitly accepted. — This thought, like after visiting other celebrities, surfaced in my mind again at this moment.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Blocked Zhongshan City, All Shops Have Resumed Business</h3>
<p>European and American Goods Replace Enemy Goods; HSBC Bank Sets Up an Office</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Since the enemy's Third Fleet blockaded the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, three to five enemy warships often patrol outside the port of Shantou, taking turns on guard, intercepting our country's sailing boats and fishing boats, and questioning foreign ships entering and leaving Shantou. The coasts of Nan'ao and Chaoyang have been attacked by enemy warships several times, but the losses are minimal, and our military defenses are also extremely tight. Therefore, the morale of the Chaoshan people is becoming more stable day by day. Shops that have resumed business in Shantou City account for nine out of ten. Army Commander Li Hanhun has also issued an order to all counties and towns in the Chaoshan region, stipulating that all shops that have not resumed business must resume business by October 30, otherwise all goods will be auctioned off, and the proceeds will be used to purchase national salvation bonds, or the owners will cancel their leases and rent them to others for business. The order in Shantou City is excellent, and air defense facilities have also been completed. There are currently one British and one American warship in the port of Shantou. Our military is stepping up protection for foreigners, churches, hospitals, and schools. Foreign firms have greatly increased their import and export of goods, rising to replace the power of Japanese goods. The Taiwan Bank, established by the enemy in Shantou, has stopped operating. HSBC Bank has sent people to Shantou to set up an office to assist European and American businesses and develop in the Chao and Mei areas. Passenger and cargo ships on regular routes to Southeast Asia and Hong Kong are more crowded than ever before.</p>

<h3>Tomorrow is the Deadline for Qianzhuang to Handle Loan Extensions</h3>
<p>Exchange Notes and Pay Interest for Those Due; New Loans Temporarily Suspended Due to the Inability to Recover Old Loans</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the tenth period for Shanghai's industry and commerce. At this time of our country's all-out war of resistance, although Qianzhuang (traditional Chinese banks) are routinely urging industrial, commercial firms, and companies that have borrowed long-term credit to repay when due, borrowers are all affected by the war and cannot repay as scheduled, requesting accommodation to extend the deadline to the end of April next year. Qianzhuang, in view of the actual difficulties, have agreed to extend the deadline, but they must exchange extension notes and pay the previous period's interest. The above extension procedures were originally scheduled to be handled tomorrow, but as it is Sunday, a holiday for Qianzhuang, they will be postponed to one day. At the same time, because Qianzhuang cannot recover loans, they have had to temporarily suspend all new loans. As for the deposits of Qianzhuang shareholders, they are all settled at the interbank rate of five yuan and five jiao, as agreed upon by the trade association. Yesterday, the market's foreign exchange interbank rate was one jiao and five fen, which was very stable, which is very different from the seven jiao rate in previous years.</p>

<h3>Youth Scout Troop Sends Scouts to the Town to Serve</h3>
<p>The Youth Scout Troop, recently at the invitation of the 18th Temporary Hospital of the Ministry of Military Affairs, sent 20 scouts to the town to serve, and has already set off in formation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Tongren Hospital Seeks Hospital Premises</h3>
<p>Capacity Desired for 300 People</p>
<p>Due to environmental reasons, Tongren Hospital is scheduled to relocate again on November 15. It is currently seeking a hospital building from all parties within its possible range, hoping to realize this in the shortest possible time. It is also reported that the hospital has hired knowledgeable and experienced Chinese and Western doctors, nurses, and assistants, and has perfect equipment in all departments. It can accommodate more than 200 patients. At this time of national crisis, rescue work is complicated and varied, but there is no suitable hospital building to accommodate patients. Therefore, it is seeking a building that can accommodate 300 people from all parties in order to continue its long-standing commitment to serving the sick people in Shanghai. The staff of the hospital can be said to be enthusiastic patriots.</p>

<h3>The Youth of the Soviet Union (1)</h3>
<p>— Liu Yucai</p>
<p>The Soviet Union government pays special attention to the training of youth, especially young students, and educates them with a kind of political education. Therefore, young men and women from the age of ten to sixteen are organized into a kind of youth group, and they are guided by the Youth Party. The number of people in this kind of youth group is now more than four million. They have so-called five proverbs and five laws to teach them how to behave.</p>
<p>The so-called five proverbs are:</p>
<p>(1) Adhere to all healthy actions, with great joy; adhere to the habit of getting up early and doing exercises.</p>
<p>(2) Save time and act quickly.</p>
<p>(3) Be diligent, persevering, and patient, and always abide by the actions of the group. In any situation, one should have a coping strategy.</p>
<p>(4) Maintain everyone's property: one should value one's books, clothes, and work area.</p>
<p>(5) Never curse people, and be careful to abstain from drinking and smoking.</p>
<p>This is an aim of the Soviet Russian youth education, but it is also a very interesting organization.</p>
<p>There is also another kind of youth group, which is an organization for people over the age of fourteen; there are more than five million members in it.</p>
<p>These two kinds of youth groups also bear some social missions. For example, when they are riding on a streetcar, they are doing the work of cracking down on people riding without tickets and checking tickets. Or sometimes, they run to the countryside to supervise the planting and harvesting of farmers. Lenin once designated this kind of group as the Soviet Russian Navy Protection Group, and later designated them as the protectors of the Soviet Russian Air Force.</p>
<p>The leading figures of the Soviet Union, in the guidance of the Youth Party in their own country, especially advocated the patriotic movement. Two years ago in May, when the Youth Party advocated the highest law of life, the so-called patriotism and the spirit of loving one's hometown aroused great enthusiastic discussion among general administrators and newspapers and magazines. Taking advantage of the disaster suffered by the Soviet Russian Arctic exploration ship Chelyuskin, they aroused the enthusiasm of the people for the rescue movement and started a fierce patriotic movement.</p>
<p>The advocacy of this kind of patriotic movement, the so-called patriots who love the Soviet Russia, have a spirit of mutual love for their motherland, language, and people. At the same time, each person gives play to his own talents and accomplishes great things for the country together. They are doing their best to avoid any actions that are detrimental to the Soviet Russia. Based on this proposition, those in power seize various opportunities to cultivate the patriotism of the general public. What is worth paying attention to is that they are working hard to make many audio films about the Chelyuskin rescue movement and audio films of sports competitions. The use of these things to give the people excitement and stimulation is nothing more than wanting to use these opportunities to cultivate the people's patriotism.</p>
<p>Their method of reward is to give various medals, badges, and titles. Among them, the title of "Hero of the Soviet Russia" is the most noble honor. This is a reward method that was only established two years ago in April. As for the rewards in sports, the title of "Meritorious Athlete" is the best. These titles, medals, and badges are all for rewarding and encouraging these patriots.</p>
