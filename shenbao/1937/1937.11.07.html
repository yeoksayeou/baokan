<h3>九國公約會議申請書送遞東京政府</h3>
<p>草案幾經修正昨晨始成立妥協　待日答覆會議休會至週二再開</p>
<p>比京　九國公約會議今晨舉行全體會議、通過致日本之修正申請書稿、內容包括關於日本在其答覆比政府請書之牒文中所稱日本未有土地野心與願與中國經濟合作、及中國所稱日本採行敵對行為蔑視九國條約義務與破壞中國土地完整各點、並聲明依照條約義務、雙方應出席會議、乃日本未參加、故本會期望日本加入、俾討論和解方法云、今晨會議時、意代表宋發言、聞新稿較昨日所擬者為佳、會議旣畢、申請書立即送交駐比日大使、並電致駐日比大使轉遞日政府、美國首席代表台維斯提議會議展至星期二日、以待日本復交、（六日中央社電）</p>
<p>比京　九國公約會議送致日本政府之申請書、其中一節、曾指出各項武力衝突均有普及性質、非可限於局部、此項文字乃為美國獲得滿意而列入者、關於此點、首由比法英美四國代表在比外交部內商得同意、最後乃與意代表馬柯迪伯爵磋商、在數分鐘之後、亦卽獲得同意、至申請書全支、則與昨晚討論各國代表團修正文以後所起草之原稿、並無多大出入、意申請書原案、會列入日本指責中國各部、但未將中國指責日本各節列入、曾經中國代表團提出異議、嗣乃將中日兩國互相指責各節一併列入、此在中國代表團方面尚屬滿意、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　英法比美四國出席九國公約會議代表、頃於上午九時在比外部內開會、討論送致日本政府之申請書、當由美國首席代表台維斯要求在申請書內、列入“國際爭端不得用武力解决”一項原則、經四國代表討論歷兩小時之久、未能歸於一致、嗣後九國公約會議於午前十一時舉行非公開會議、加以繼續討論之後、始乃成立妥洽、各國代表對於美國代表所提出之修正文、多表示異議、蕭“不得以武力解决國際爭端”一項原則、在過去歷史上足以引起爭執、且申請書倘加入此項原則、則在日本將視為係對於日本行動之又一種譴責、因之使日本不能與九國公約會議進行談判也、但經各國代表交換意見之後、仍將美國代表此項修正文列入、惟辭句則略形緩和、至午後一時五十分意國代表馬柯迪伯爵宣佈關於申請書全文、業已成立妥洽、當於午後送達日本政府、然後於晚間六時予以公佈云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>比京　九國公約會議秘書處頃發表公報、內稱、“今晨十一時九國公約會議第五次集會、已將昨日所决定送致日本之申請書文字予以確定、此項申請書當由比駐日大使立卽送交日政府、同時並由九國公約會議祕書長遞交日本駐比大使”、至此項申請書原文、當於午後六時向報界發表、九國公約會議則定於下星期二上午舉行會議、届時希望日政府覆文可以送達、假如日本接受與人數較少之委員會進行談判、則該委員會究應如何加以組織、已由出席各國代表開始交換意見云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日本政策不變更我决無議和餘地</h3>
<p>自信儘有餘力作長期抗戰　我代表團否認德出任調解</p>
<p>［南京］外報謠傳中日事件、巳在九國公約會議外進行調解、頃據外交部發言人談、絕對不確、（六日中央社電）</p>
<p>［南京］近數日來、外人方面盛傳中日行將議和停戰、茲據美聯社所得官方消息、謂此種流言、絕對無稽、同時據外人之熟悉軍事者觀察、中國對於日軍之侵略、儘有餘力為長期之抵抗、所謂和議當然談不到、又據中國負責當局告美聯社記者言、於今日而與日本言和議、卽為漢奸、該當局又謂外國方面亦無向中國作如是之建議者、政府中人莫不意見一致、以為除非日本改變對華政策、殊無議和之餘地、（六日國民電）</p>
<p>比京　日本宣傳機關散播謠言、竟謂德元首希特勒將出而擔負調解中日爭端之任務云云、査日方此種宣傳、其用意顯在擾亂各國出席九國公約會議代表之意見、而阻碍九國公約會議之工作、我國出席九國公約會議代表團發言人、五日晚曾對上說予以堅决之否認、並謂我國駐德大使程天放甫由德行抵比京、負責表示上述消息、純屬讕言、並無隻字可信云、（六日中央社電）</p>
<p>［柏林］據可靠方面消息、德元首希特勒對於中日戰爭、有出任調停之意、唯現尚待意大利方面之反應、大約一俟里賓特羅甫自羅馬返此後、此事即有眉目、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>［柏林］關於德國調停中日兩國衝突之說、消息靈通人士頃實稱、德國政府現正考盧調停之可能與否、截止目前為止、並未有所發動、且在最近將來或亦不致成為事實、消息靈通人土並謂、德國出任調停、較諸九國公約會議出任調停為佳、蓋出席九國公約會議之多數國家、均與遠東關係較少故也、關於此事、聞德日兩國外交當局、即將開始有所接洽云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　關於德國政府調處中日兩國爭端之說、此間外交界聞悉之餘、頗為震動、消息靈通人士、憶及德國前此拒不參加九國公約會議之時、曾經聲明“無論何時、一俟若干項必不可缺之先决絛件實現之後、德國卽凖備出面合作、以期中日兩國爭端得以和平解决”云云、爰乃均以德國是否等待有利時機、以便單獨進行仲裁工作為問、顧自中日兩國爭端開始以還、德國對於中國雖未表示何項惡感、德國外交當局雖亦希望單獨行動、克底於成、俾使集體行動相形見拙、但德日兩國旣已成立反共恊定、德國在中日兩國爭端中、卽不復有仲裁之資格、加之德國恐亦不願直接有所發動、致與英美兩國互相對峙、以故調處之議、未必成為事實、此在中國代表團方面、則對於調處一說、亦毫無所聞、比京外交界並以為、中國信賴集體行動、以與日本相抗、當不致接受調處之議、致與英美兩國背道而馳云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］關於德國調停中日兩國爭端之說、美國務院人員頃宣稱、此間並無所知、此在半官界人士、則謂德國若果出任調停、美國不致予以反對、但以柏林東京兩處最後消息而論、一般人均以為德國調停之議、未必見諸事實云（中央社五日哈瓦斯）</p>
<h3>前日會議討論情形</h3>
<p>各代表提修正案</p>
<p>比京九國公約會議本日討論致送日本政府申請書草案、未能成立妥恊、結果商定由各國代表分別以修正案送達大會秘書處、傳得據以擬成新草案、而於明日午前提付全體會議加以决定、按之原起草人即九國公約會議主席斯巴克、初意亟望與日本進行談判、因而申請書初稿、僅將日本照會（即上月廿七日所發出用以拒絕比國邀請者）所載關於指摘中國之詞句予以援引、此在中國首席代表顧維鈞則在會議席上堅决予以反對、謂當同時援引中國政府所提出之申訴、以昭公允、但有人又恐因此妨碍申請書之妥恊性質、而使日本再度加以拒絕、蘇聯代表李維諾夫爰乃主張九國公約會議當向日本提出照會、請其與會議進行接洽、不易附以備忘錄、而用以申述中日隻方之論據、但以爲折衷之計、各國代表意見仍未能一致、最後始乃决定由各國代表用書面提出修正案、俾得據以另行起草申請書、迨至午後六時、除意國而外、其他各國所提修正案均已分別送達、比國首席代表斯巴克當即根據各該修正案、擬就新草案、而與英美法三國代表在比國外交部共同加以研究、一俟意國修正案遞到後　此項新草案或尚須酌予修正、亦未可知、但一般人希望不致再有重大改動、茲將主要各國所提州之修正案、分述於次、㊀中國修正案、堅持申請書必須同時援引中國政府所提出之申訴、因此新草案乃將日本照會關於指摘中國各節、予以删去、㊁蘇聯修正案、要求將申請書內交涉及共產主義之處、予以删去、業已照辦、㊂法國修正案主張三點、㊀申請書內應聲明一俟日本覆文送達九國公約會議之後、各國代表即當舉行全體會議、指派小組委員會、傳與日本政府進行談判、㊁應聲明中國對於九國公約所規定之妥恊程序、旣已接受參加、足證該國對於中日兩國爭端、並不反對用和平手段加以解决、㊂關於申請書所載“各國代表　純粹一在九國公約範圍之內交換意見、一語、純粹”二字應改爲“務當”、則以蘇聯並非九國公約簽字國故也、新草案對於法國所提上述三項意見、大都予以採納、㊃美國首席代表台維斯所提出之修正案、主張申請書內應答明、任何衝突、欲其範圍限於世界一隅、而不擴大决不可能、此項修正案、乃以羅斯福總統前在芝加哥城所發表之演說爲根據、一般人以為美國在國際外交文件中、援引羅斯福總統之言論、此乃第一次、因而極爲重視、並謂美國政府對於國際問題、不若前此之漠視、於此亦可獲”明證、此外、台維斯並堅主申請書對於日本拒不參加會議之理由、必須有以駁斥之、並當詢問日本政府究擬派員參加會議、抑願與未來小組委員會發生接觸、英法美比四國代表定於明晨九時十五分再度集會、俾就意國修正案加以研究而於十一時以申請書定稿、提付九國公約會議討論、届時倘能表决通過、即當由主席斯巴克具名、送達日本政府云、（中央社五日哈瓦斯電）蔣程已抵比京</p>
<p>白魯塞爾　蔣百里將軍曁我駐德大使程天放、五日聯袂抵京、（六日中央社電）</p>
<h3>日本揚言凖備對我宣戰</h3>
<p>圖威嚇和平陣綫國家　冀達到直接交涉目的</p>
<p>［東京］此間官方人士宣稱、關於是否對華宣戰、及是否果爾成“帝國大本營”兩事、日本政府均尚未完全確定、但政界人士相信、兩事均勢在必行、其實現之期迫於眉睫云、（五日海通電）</p>
<p>［南京］連日敵方傳播對我將宣戰及組織戰時大本營之消息、聲勢煊赫、頗聳聽聞、頃據某觀察家談稱、敵方此種行動、勿論將來是否成為事實“但在目前、則至少為一種烟幕、正式宣戰之惹起國際糾紛、對其本身之種種不利、敵方寗不自知、然必於英美對遠東問題　表示澈底合作、及比京會議開幕後、始傳播將正式宣戰者、其目的不外宣示、㊀糾紛益形複雜、戰事範圍將擴大、以圖威嚇愛好和平之國家、㊁脅迫比京會議、放棄九國公約精神或雖開會而以敷衍了事、使中日兩國在會外直接交涉敵方策略、除一貫的宣傳表示中日糾紛絕不受第三者干涉外、在會議中則請其友邦力主直接交涉、東京讀賣新聞曾載日外務省一文、批評比京會議預測謂、“將一面組織小組委員會、敷衍一切、一面靜觀事態之轉移、至遇有適當機會時再行出塲云”故竭力設法阻止“適當機會之到來、此近日對我宣戰與組織大本營空氣日益濃厚之所由來也、至吾國方面、橫被敵人侵略、國交未絕、早受摧殘之痛、宣與不宣、實無何分別、吾人除為捍衛國家疆土、人類正義抵抗侵略橫暴外、切盼愛好和平之國家、勿為敵方宣傳所惑、更盼比京會議、本華府會議時精神、勿使九國公約徒成歷史上創例之廢紙云云、（五日中央社電）</p>
<h3>法與暹羅簽訂友好恊定</h3>
<p>曼谷　暹羅與法國政府之商務航運友好恊定、已於昨日簽字、並附有暹羅與法屬安南之恊定、此次恊定為暹羅與列强所訂商務公約之第二恊定、第一次恊定為與日本所締結者、已與上星期二簽字、至暹羅與英國之恊定、已與上週滿期、因某項商務問題、雙方意見、未趨一致、尚未重訂、（六日海通社電）</p>
<h3>俄駐美大使發表演說</h3>
<p>對侵略國致警告</p>
<p>［紐約］蘇聯駐美大使特羅雅諾夫斯基、今日在卡耐奇廳舉行蘇聯二十週慶祝紀念時發表演詞、對於世界軍人欲在戰塲與紅軍一較强弱者、予以警告、謂此種較量將使任何優略者慘敗、又謂侵略者設法在蘇聯境內、設置强有力之間諜網、並利用落伍份子肆其反對蘇　聯政體之　陰謀、以此爲進攻蘇聯之凖備、惟此種敗類、已爲蘇聯當局所肅淸、紅軍乃愈强固、至於中國與西班牙之問題、並不在共產主義、許多侵略國大呼反共、實則以此為烟幕彈、俾掩護其對於他國之攻擊耳、無論如何、蘇聯現已凖備一切、以防衛其疆界、並欲與嗜愛和平之各國共同維護和平、（中央社五日路透電）</p>
<h3>日意德沆瀣一氣反共公約簽字</h3>
<p>意德對中日戰事　表示守中立態度</p>
<p>［羅馬］德義日三國反共公約今晨十一時由意外相齊亞諾、德駐英大使里賓特羅甫、日駐意大使堀田•在奇齊宮勝利殿舉行簽字、意國政府官吏、德日兩國大使館人員到塲觀禮者甚衆、德元首希特勒元首之親信希斯亦在其列、簽字旣舉、外相齊亞諾當卽發表演說稱、德日意三大民族茲已團結一致、以防禦布爾希維克主義、但須加聲明者、此項公約旣無其他秘密目標、亦不反對任何國家、且歡迎各國對于此種有助于和平與文明之實際工具、共同參加、里賓特羅甫大使繼之致詞、稱此項公約有重要的歷史意義、其目的僅在防止第三國際之威脅、保障各國之生活與文明、並不反對任何國家、繼由堀田大使發言、則謂意德日三國代表本日在此簽訂反共公約、望能充實共同防衛、以對付共產主義之威脅、而保障三國之固有文明、深信必能獲得美滿結果云、外長齊亞諾施偕同里賓特羅甫與堀內兩大使前往威尼斯宮謁見墨索里尼首相、面呈公約調文墨索里尼表示欣慰之餘、並說明此項公約之重要性、而以意國大十字勛章贈與里賓特羅甫與堀田兩大使、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］關於德意日三國反共公約之簽訂、意政府方面聞已向中國政府表示、在目前中日衝突中、意大利並不援助日本、而守完全中立之態度、意大利報紙雖向日本表示同情、認日本在中國之行動、係反共性質、但政府方面則謂願與雙方保持友誼云　中央社六日路透）</p>
<p>［巴黎］據此間晨報駐羅馬訪員電稱、意德日反共公約似具有軍事同盟條約形式、意國外交部因恐世界輿論誤會此舉、卽係該國對於日本現行對華政策之同情表示、業向中國駐意大使館提出保證、重申雙方睦誼、卽德國外交部亦曾向中國大使館提出同樣保證云、（中央社六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>工業突飛猛進</p>
<p>偉大的史丹林五年計劃的成功、使蘇聯的景况有了澈底的改變、落後的農業國俄羅斯、現已變為一個獨立而進步的强有力的工業化的社會主義國家、蘇聯整個國民經濟的技術的再建、已由偉大的十月革命的二十週年紀念而完成、自從蘇維埃政權建立之後、强大的社會主義工業已被創立起來、現在蘇聯的工業生產總額中有四分之三、是由蘇維埃政府建立的工塲和工廠生產出來、現在蘇聯工業的生產、比一九一七年革命前增十五倍、一九三六年蘇維埃鋼鐵工業的三大工塲、瑪尼托哥斯克•庫茲湼茲克•馬其也夫卡所提鍊的鋼鐵的總額、就跟帝俄全國鋼鐵工業所提鍊的總額相等、現在蘇聯的工業佔歐洲第一位、居世界第二位、蘇聯已發見的石炭的蘊藏額已增加了七倍半、帝俄時代全國鐵的蘊藏額、已發見的只十萬萬五千萬噸、現在却增到二千五百萬萬噸、再就電力的生產總額而論、在世界各大國中、帝俄是居於末位的、但兩次五年計劃實行之後、蘇聯已建立了幾十個巨大的電力站、一九三六年的尼泊電力跕一處所生產的電力、已比帝俄時代的所有電力跕的總生產額還要多、同年電力的總生產額較諸戰前的總生產額要超過十六倍、蘇聯電力總生產額現在已居歐洲的第二位、世界的第三位自從蘇維埃政權建立以來、蘇聯成爲一個巨大的鐵道國家、鐵道綫長度已經增加了一倍半、現在總數已達八萬五千基羅米突、帝俄時代完全沒有航空運輸、而一九三六年蘇聯的航空綫却達十一萬基羅米突、現在蘇聯全國的外貌、已完全改變了、兩條第一級的巨大運河業已完成、使莫斯科成爲一個暢通五大海的港口、</p>
<p>集體農業成績</p>
<p>全國已有二百三十個新城市建立起來、革命前俄國那些舊鄕鎭的景象是很憂鬱的、木犂是主要的生產工具、一千萬農家所佔有的土地與二萬八千個地主所擁有的相等、革命以後、農業有了澈底的改革、農民揀取了集體化的社會主義的道路、蘇聯社會主義的農業、是全世界最大規模的最强大的、在設備上又是最技術化　、現在集體農塲和國營農塲耕種的面積、佔全耕地自分之九九•一、機器曳引機和曳引機站的數目已超過三十五萬六千、曳引機操作的總容積、已比美國的超過一倍集體農塲的收入、已迅速地增加、最近二年來差不多增加了一倍蘇維埃農塲的收穫、也大有增加、一九三七年的總額約達七十萬萬蒲特、（每蒲特約三十六磅）農業的生產總額、比戰前的增加一倍、文化在蘇聯鄕鐵上之所以能廣汎地展開、達到其他各國所想不到的程度以及社會主義鄕鎮在工作與生活的方式上之能與社會主義城市的日趨接近、完全是以集體農塲和國營農塲爲礎石的、</p>

<h3>國際紅十字救濟難民委員會促成南市安全區</h3>
<p>饒神甫闡明創議之意義　關係方面了解顧全人道</p>
<p>字林報云、國際紅十字救濟難民委員會與中日雙方當局談判數日、南市闢一安全區之舉、卒吿成功、昨夜（五日）已由中日雙方與該委員會簽妥協定、其詳細內容現尚未悉、聞該區域包括方浜路北面舊日縣城之地段、昨日該委員會主席饒神甫曾發表關於該計劃之文吿日、連日報紙對於中日當局與鄙人（國際紅十字救濟難民委員會主度）及日本當局與鄙人籌商在南市闢一安全區、以供中國非戰鬥人民居住計劃、載有數文、致引起錯誤之印𧰼、今似宜加以解釋而糾正之、並藉以防免或消除因此而起之任何疑懼、該區為南市平民安全住所、並非中立區域、蓋旣非中立、亦非一區域也、且不能稱為非軍備地、至於籌商此舉、確非為法人利益起見、亦非為保全南市中教會之產業、鄙人不知其地是否有教會之產業焉、此純粹為非戰鬥員之安全區、因日本與中國雙方為人道起見、皆願保護非戰鬥員、此舉始克吿成、鄙人深知此種辦法‵乃屬創見、且望如歐洲等處、亦能仿行、為益匪淺諒不河漢余言焉、</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、南市非戰鬥員安全區恊定、聞已於昨晚七時、由有關係之雙方簽字、於是為人道主義奔走多日國際團體之努力、乃吿成功、其內容昨夜猶未能探悉、聞將於今晨開會討論作最後之决定、其主要點為該區之警務問題、此舉發起者、為國際紅十字會、而饒神甫奔走最力、雖幕後進行、巳閱多日、但直至三日前、始公布其性質、該區南以方浜路為界、其他三面皆以法租界為界、將不作任何軍事活動、而能容納巨數中國難民、</p>
<p>大陸報云、南市非戰鬥員安全區、並非由中日雙方締結恊定而成、不過由雙方核准救濟難民委員會之申請而已．委員會中有濮蘭特氏·安德魯氏．麥克那登氏·巴波德氏•迦斯巴氏·巴倫資氏、</p>
<p>英女大美晚報云、日大使署發言人今晨（六日）接見新聞訪員時、述及南市平民安全區事、謂此項辦法僅為過渡性質、恊定原則、雖經商妥、但迄今尚未簽字、昨夜日當局會致書國際紅十字救濟離民委員會、一俟接到饒神甫之覆書、日當局將考盧該恊定實行事、又聞該區之警務問題、業已議决、故今日上午將公布該區之成立、聞仍將由上海市政府警察局擔任區內之警務、中國當局巳切實聲明劃定該區、並未簽有任何恊定、此事由國際委員會與中日雙方接洽、一俟商妥、將由該會發表一文、宣布該區之成立、並附地圖、示明安全區之界限云、</p>
<p>華東社記者昨訪倡議設立難民區之饒神甫於震旦大學、饒氏斷其右臂、以左手與記者握手為禮、操純熟之英語以答記者詢問、據談滬戰開始、國際難民收容所卽盡力收容難民、以徐家匯一處而論、每餐卽需供給七千人、南洋大學近亦收容三千人、現復新建收容所三處、一可容難民五千、一可容三千、又謂閘北華軍撤退、難民又形增加、邇日天氣轉寒、不加收容、將如何了結、以此本人遂首先向華方耍求劃一難民區於滬南華方業已明白、始再與日方接洽、日方現亦明白、一二日內、一切均可妥緒、嗣後該區居民、可避免一切戰爭上之危險、如該區有空隙地位、而租界方面難民衆多、無法繼續容納者、則可設法收容於該處也云云、</p>
<p>又據官方表示、滬南向無駐軍、該區域亦僅名義上稱為難民區並無任何組織、主權等等一切歸我故無所謂何日開始也、又據華東社記者探悉、前日下午四時、俞市長饒神父及社會局潘局長、曾在市府冉度商討此事、地段等等已可無問題、聞决定方浜路以北、民國路以南、小東門以西、方浜橋以東之區域為難民區約估城區三分之一之地位云、</p>
<p>國民社云、自我軍戰綫移動後、滬西一帶難民麕集、上海國際救濟會救濟組主任饒家駒·馬瑞山·特請救世軍中佐白克禮、隊長杜保田等營救難民一萬二千名、引入租界、除將難民四千餘人送海格路收容所、二千分送一二三收容所外、於早晚發給米飯饅頭、其餘約有六千餘名、至小沙渡路第四收容所、因該所時間不及趕建草棚、約須六日後方可完工、在此時期、承饒家駒借給大篷帳二項、暫作蔽雨之所、饒馬兩氏鑒於近來難民日益增加、租界區域內收容所已無餘屋及空地再行收容、創設南市安全區、其性質及範圍、已誌昨日本報、大約卽可成立云、</p>

<h3>持久抗戰與組織農民義勇軍之建議</h3>
<p>— 黃士英</p>
<p>神聖的民族全面抗戰展開了，在最高領袖堅决態度領導之下，獲得全國民衆綱鐵般的團結，凡是中華民國的人民，奠不深刻的認識此次抗敵戰爭，實為我民族存亡關頭，都具有服從政府抗戰到底的堅定信念與决心，這决心，亦是中華民族求解放復興的基石。</p>
<p>目前英勇的戰士，在前綫作浴血苦鬬，已予侵略者以猛烈之打擊，後方民衆，竭誠擁護輸將，集中國力，作持久的抵抗，愛國的民衆，莫不𤍠血沸騰，起血謀救亡圖存，正義伸張之日，亦正我人奮勇抗敵之候，惟目前民衆組織，尚缺乏適當之實際抗敵機構，我人深覺欲增强抗敵軍事，能力，與達到持久决勝之目的，必須增强抗敵軍事效能，而抗敵軍事效能的增强，實舍武裝民衆而莫爾，尤以農民之武裝爲最得力。蓋我國爲以農立國，農民估全國百分之八十以上，以此而組織部隊，實施政教，無慮成重全國皆兵，其力量之偉大，實無可比擬•况農民本身，以利種爲生，可不受組織而影響其工作，此種策略，實含有庽兵於農之意義。則日宼雖具堅甲利兵其抵抗實有十敵人以步步荆棘之苦。故組織農民義勇軍，實有積極展開擴大之必要，此我人所以有農民義勇軍組織之建議也。</p>
<p>目前農民智識，雖然幼稚，對於此次民族抗戰意織，理解十分糢糊，或竟莫明究竟，此種民智呆滯之現𧰼，如不再急速加以訓練，而欲求民族解放持久抗戰勝利，實有些南轅而北轍，余爲欲積極探硏此問題與實施起見，曾親歷調査農民心理，分別歸納如下四種。</p>
<p>第一種爲不聞天下事者，此輩農民無非為安分守己之流。（包括富農與自耕農）彼等心理，以能夠耕種，年年豐收，得飽食爲己足，不管任何朝代一來臨，此種農民，如以日軍佔領後，沒收土地，燒殺村莊，姦淫婦女，慘戮兒童等之宣傳剌激之後，必能換起深刻的憤怒情緒，而改變茍安心理；有趨同積極抗日之可能，</p>
<p>第二種烏怨天尤地之流。此輩爲貧農佃農之類，日常生活爲貧困所壓迫，連年債台高築，無法淸償，中心本很恨鬱，如以貧困爲日人搜括剝削所致，若不及早撲滅倭寇，日後則必遭慘斃，等事實刺激之，其本身之痛苦，必遷怒於敵人。起殺敵以求日後生活之改善。</p>
<p>第三種為胆怯怕死者。此種農民，祗須以上兩種農民宣傳成功後，摩擦與激蕩，自可增進勇氣，熔冶一爐。</p>
<p>第四種爲好事農民．此輩農民，對於抗日心理，已高人一等，然雖具抗敵思想，而爲歪曲之迷信所阻礙。例如松地農民，往往以爲有關公大帝穿紅袍揮大刀殺敵之流言，此輩農民之抗敵情緒雖高，惟缺乏領導，誤入歧途，如焚香求天等等不現實之盲目行動，設或加以剴切訓導，灌輸以正確之民族思想，曉以救亡大義，以保衛耕地領土爲農民之天職等宣傳，並授以軍事組織，其戰鬥力定必強勁。正義之火，如烈燄添油，實力之浩大，倭寇即見而生畏，民族抗戰前途，自必在民衆組織堅定把握中也。</p>
<p>曩昔墨四哥革命之秋，其摧毀專制暴虐之羈王者，爲武裝之農夫，卒以傾覆皇室，創造其和，其力量可以想見。東北我義男軍與敵轉戰經年，不屈不撓，每使敵軍疲於奔命，或受重創，即其一例。蘇省浦南一帶，不乏勇敢善戰之農夫與鹽民，惜政府尚未注意及之。滬地某師長曾對新聞記者表示，平時不注意組織民意，到戰時就吃了大虧，無怪我軍所到一處，不見民衆。衹見“漢奸”，我軍之防地，及軍事設備，不移時已為漢奸通知敵方矣，此種驚心怵目之事實，能不予找人以深切注意，而視爲抗戰　途之莫大隱憂，然而往者已矣，來者可追，亡羊補牢，時猶未晚，故我人耍求政府能慨然允准民衆誠意之合理請求，派遣督察員指導，從速連絡各地有志有能力對農民聲望最高態度坦白者，急速發動，組織農民義勇軍．可於近戰地後方開始訓練，發給槍枝，共策其力，以武力粉碎侵略者“征服中國”之計劃•保衛祖國領土主權之完整。</p>
<p>茲附農民義勇軍組織實施大概於後，以供參考，領導與組織農民義勇軍之人物，必須與農民素有淵源與聲望頗高，爲當地農民所悅服者，起初可以從小部分村落着手，逐漸推廣，易於成就。</p>
<p>農民義勇軍初步組織時，宜着重於宣傳，繼之以訓練，除授以遊擊載術而外，尚須注意於政治訓練，即如蔣委員長之所謂三分軍事，七分政治是也。政治訓練如每日講堂以三民主義為基礎教程，從事黨化教育，及信任領袖，信仰政府，農民對之，初或生疏，日後必感興趣。而此種非常時期之國防宣傳，日後俱能成為優秀之農民，旣利國防，更益華衆文化，兼收並蓄，有一舉兩得之妙。</p>
<p>農民義　軍之戰鬥訓練，當以採取最鋭敏之游擊戰術，其地設遇敵人進廹，農民即於田畝間三五成羣應戰，以輔助軍隊之陣地戰，以聲東擊西之牽制戰，以整化零之句圍戰，以零化整之殲滅戰，以少勝多之奇兵戰，以寡敵衆之援兵戰等戰法，當聘請遊擊教官教練之。以我國幅員之廣，農民之衆，受訓組織以後，則阡陌縱橫於出野，耕種往來於其間者，悉爲保衛張土之便衣健兒，非但抗戰實力增强，亦因此而建造農民生活之集體化基礎，一掃過去自私現𧰼，况農民本業農，生產米糧，自食其力，其組織無須如軍隊之消耗給養，加以農民誠樸成性，經過相當訓練之後，無事時工作如常，一朝出征必能奮勇爭先，其實力不可厚侮，處此全面抗戰，上下團結，以武裝農民爲後盾，足以挽救祖國之危亡而有餘也。反之，以目前農民智識程度之幼稚，散漫舞方，頗易爲敵人所利用，因農民對於當地地理頗熟稔，投無止當組織，不死於砲火，即供其驅策與嚮導，或以糧食資敵，其破壞抗敵陳容，影響頗大，至堪注意，即爲避砲火而逃背鄕井，遂爲流蕩之匪民，必煩地方當局之安揷與救濟，或為生活鋌而走險，擾亂後方安寗，設已為義勇軍之組織，則遇敵人進迫，自可於田野間起而應戰，予敵重創，其利害於抗戰前途，適成一反比例，相差實不可以道里計。</p>
<p>農民義勇軍如遇岀征，擊退敵軍，或輔助軍隊而擊退敵軍之後，並不追擊，仍於田間耕種，如此可不减少其生産工作，農民義勇軍於必要時，可遣派一部份為附近城市警衛之需，警力簿弱之處即可由農民怖崗，一以鎮壓漢奸，安靖地方，維持秩序，匪徒宵小，亦可望而生畏，且又與當地人民本多連絡，其職務勢必融洽週到，設遇空襲，或遭火警，農民義勇軍亦可估救護掩埋與消防等工作•至其伙食給養，可以每村落田主之產額數量分派之，無勞民傷財之弊，農婦在戰時負救濟保護兒童運輸之職，戰事意外費用，與日後撫䘏等，可山地主之租額上按數徵收之．組織武裝農民，初或未必使農民感受興趣，可以小部份着手，要求軍事當局先發少數槍枝，成立小隊，農民每對槍械發生興感，漸漸擴大參加，我人如能努力宜揚救亡大義，擁護者必風起雲湧，內部組織，以村莊為單位，成立為義勇小隊，設隊長一人，合附近數村落成，義勇中隊，以三中隊為義勇大隊，以縣區為總隊，總隊分軍事政治，秘書情報救護總務等幹部組織。</p>
<p>血鐘響了，神聖民族解放還動已展開最猛之血戰，我大以焦土抗戰之决心，抗戰到底，際此國勢阽危，救國不能徒托空言，必須作有效之實際戰門，以達勝利目的，故組織農民義勇軍，實爲爭但而切要之舉。</p>
<p>因此我們赤誠地請求政府與軍事當局，深深考慮，吾則願在政府與蔣委員長領導之下，發動組織，造成軍民一片，為國犧牲，努力抗戰到底。</p>

<h3>蘇聯革命與中國抗戰張志讓</h3>
<p>今天是蘇聯十月革命的二十周年紀念日。我們在對日抗戰的中間，來祝賀這個友邦的國慶，應該覺着格外地親切。</p>
<p>蘇聯在十月革命的中間及其以後是對着兩個目標邁進：第一是解放，第二是和平。解放是民衆對着沙皇和他所代表的階層的壓迫求解放，和平是從本國對各帝國主義者的和平着手來努力爭取世界的和平。它所採取的方法是奮鬥——武力奮鬥。中國現在是全民族對着日本帝國主義的壓迫求解放，並且也是從自己對於日本民族的和平着手來努力爭取世界的和平。我們所用的方法是抗戰——也是武力的奮鬥。</p>
<p>蘇聯努力於自己對外和平與世界和平的過程中，有許多地方與我國對日抗戰有密切的關係。這是在今天紀念友邦國慶之時所應該特別提出注意的。</p>
<p>蘇聯建國之初，就接受了一個沙皇手裏遺下來的戰爭。這個戰爭是帝國主義者間互圖侵略的戰爭，根本上就是無意識的。所以它就一面用快刀斬亂麻底手段，把它結束；而一面就用全民的武力來解放當時爲各帝國主義者所支持着的內亂。結果是叛徒消滅，外國軍隊完全離境。這就是反對相互侵略的戰爭和抵抗外來侵略的一個榜樣。</p>
<p>蘇聯參加軍縮會議之後，就提出了一個“侵略者”的定義。這個定義在一九三三年爲軍縮會議的安全委員會所採取，並且在同一年內經芬蘭，波蘭，羅馬尼亞等國與蘇聯把它作爲根據，訂立公約。在這個定義中間我們所要提出一點，就是凡用武力侵入他國領士者，無論曾否宣戰均應認爲侵略者。這就是日本侵略中國和義大利侵略阿比西尼亞的方式。它的簡單明瞭足以使侵略者不再有詭辯的餘地。這是無形中給與它們的一個帮助。</p>
<p>蘇聯一面還在理論上由它的外交委員長李維諾夫提出了一個關於和平性質的學說——就是和平爲不可分。帝國主義者向來對於侵略戰爭，如以前的中日戰爭和義阿戰爭，都看作是單純兩國間的事情，與世界和平無關。結果是一再撒下了擾亂世界和平的種子。現在九國公約會議是爲了這種戰爭而開的，我們應該竭力使參與會議的各國注意到這個學說的眞理。</p>
<p>和平不可分的學說，運用到實際上來，就當然發生兩個結論。第一是：所謂“戰爭區域化”是一個極危險的主張；它的結果是放任侵略。第二是：各地域的集體安全應該努力促其實現。現在我國正在力主各國對日制裁並建立太平洋集體安全制度，對於這個學說的運用，尤其應該重視。</p>
<p>蘇聯對於世界和平的努力還與我國在抗戰中間發生了直接的關係。滬上戰事開始不久，就與我國訂立互不侵犯條約。李維諾夫於九月二十一日在國聯大會痛詆侵略國，主張應以集體抵抗的方法對付：同月二十七日在諮詢委員會表示完全贊同英國譴責日本空軍轟炸行爲的建議，十月五日在國聯大會宣稱：諮詢委員會認定日本侵華事實，未用“侵略”字樣，且未提議在物質上援助中國，均足引爲憾事；本月四日復在九國公約會議中警吿各國，勿使國際會議變爲侵略者之工具，並主張採取切實辦法，以保障或恢復和平•這些都是直接帮助我國，藉以爭取世界和平的行爲。</p>
<p>蘇聯爲要爭取世界的和平，已經有了上述的那些行爲，我們在此國際會議的期間，尤其希望它能進一步地與英，美，法，等國商定聯合制裁侵略的辦法。而我國在此被侵略的期間，尤其應該對外表示。破釜沉舟，百折不撓底抗戰决心，使和平陣綫也進一步地加强起來，來對付世界上的侵略者！</p>

<h3>參加軍民聯歡會歸來記</h3>
<p>— 章祺瑞</p>
<p>在民衆報發表了某縣軍民抗戰聯歡會的消息後，鎮公所就徵求民衆意見；“怎樣去參加這偉大的盛會”？經過許多人的討論，决定向司令及××軍全髒將士獻勝利旗兩面；參加遊藝內時間局促，沒有充份的預備，祗得留待下次的機會。</p>
<p>兩面旗的绣製工作，分派給張引仙•章琦瑋•胡湘琴及我四個人趕製，四個女孩子很用心的在棚架前一針一針的绣着，遠遠的砲聲隆隆的傳入耳鼓，格格的飛機不時的在頭頂上盤旋，我們的血已經沸騰了，我們的心太興奮了，我們默祝着前方將士勝利，我們默祝着前方将士平安；中國的婦女替保衛祖國的將十綉製勝利旗，是為了民族的生存，爭取自由和光明；並不像日本的婦女替侵略鄰國的軍閥縫製千人衣，助長跋扈軍人的兇焰，毀滅了人世間的人道和正義！</p>
<p>開會的日期到了，一雙小船戴着二十多個人向××鎮進發，在船上我們敎兩個小孩子獻花籃時的禮節，他們年紀雖小，可是很懂事，五歲的年齡已經曉得擁護我們的領袖，打倒我們的敵人，他們不時把香煙盒製成的假手槍，指着天說：‘打死日本人’│小手行着軍禮說：“向總詞令敬禮！我們要救護中國，一定要特別注意兒童的初期教育，在小腦海裹灌足了救國的種子，土耳其的復與正是我們的好榜樣！</p>
<p>到達月的地，已經十一時三十分鐘，我們的行列在公共塲所正門前，拍了一張照，然後向大會報到。</p>
<p>大禮堂的正面，掛着一張極大的圖書，這是戰地服務傳的作品，上面是敵人慘殺同胞的景像，我們看了這張書應該像寒大吃冰塊，塊塊在心頭，牢記着敵人的殘酷，抱定着抗敵的决心，四週還密貼着警醒的標語，大禮堂內已坐着不少人，今天真熱鬧，明白軍和民中間，沒有什麼橫阻着的障礙物，我們的軍和民携起手來，站在一条戰綫上抵抗我們的敵人。</p>
<p>一時三十分開會，先由主席縣長致詞，誠懇的態變，激昂的言論，使聽衆的　經被他的言語所吸引，陣陣的拍掌聲．衝破了全塲的空氣．接着就是×司令訓話。</p>
<p>除了報章上，曾經見過×司令肖像，從沒有見過×司令的面，聽過×司令的訓話，令天這夢想實現了，我們眞有幸在國防的最前綫日遇見抗敵英雄！</p>
<p>×司令後是郭沫若田漢兩先生的演講郭先生亡命在日本十年，在國難嚴重的今日，終於投到祖國的懷抱裹，爲民族生存而奮鬥•他說：‘×司令是著名的鐵軍，×司令現在××防守，耶未××的民衆在x司令領導之下，應該做一個鐵民‘│對！我們每個人都應做鐵民，我們該迅速的鍛練，成為眞正抗敵的鐵民。在我以往的想像，田漢先生是活潑，剛强，又很為修飾的中年人，可是今天親眼看見，我的想像完全錯誤，田漢先生並不活潑剛强而是很沉靜，一身半新的中山裝一點不加修飾，態度鎮靜語氣沉着，每一句話打動人的心，像詩一樣美麗，又像歌一般的雄壯，使我們哭，也使我們笑。</p>
<p>演講完畢後，就輪到我們獻花和獻旗，我們的代表張小姐等四人，由縣黨部×常務引導着，走向檯上，在鼓掌聲中，×司令笑容可掬的受了敬禮以及花和旗，接着遊藝的節目就開始了。</p>
<p>今天的節目很名貴，在××是破天荒的大會串，合戲劇歌舞於一㷾，激發民族的意識，宣傳敵人的殘暴，使每個觀衆因興奮而流淚，怒吼！</p>
<p>歸途中暮色茫茫，遠望東北，火光冲天，默念着‘待從頭收拾舊山河，朝天闕’！心裹感覺到一陣壯烈的辛酸，險些流出淚來。（却酬）</p>

<h3>上海絲廠有賴推動開繅</h3>
<p>秋繭滯頓無人收買　蠶蛾缺乏影響繅製　全浙繭商定期集議</p>
<p>江浙絲廠、因受戰事暨其他種種原因、迄茲開工者寥寥、茲探錄各項實情於左、</p>
<p>開工絲廠狀况</p>
<p>上海現在開工絲廠、雖已有怡和•鴻豊•同裕•三家、惟一係外商、一係代繅、故其開工與否、於整個絲繭業、並無多大裨益、且三家雖共有絲車一千一百餘部、惟並末全數開繅、開車者蓋猶不足半數、</p>
<p>觀望癥結所在</p>
<p>查三家所繅、尚係春期存繭、關於秋繭、上海絲廠、迄未收買故上海特區、屬於安全地帶之絲廠雖尚多、均未開工推原其故、約有下列各點為梗、㊀戰事起後、絲銷殊滯㊁𧖟蛾無供給、㊂照現值繭價、成絲後無利可得、</p>
<p>蠶蛾問題概述</p>
<p>上述三項原因、除二兩項、自易明瞭、第三項有非經管該業者所難曉、緣蘭子剝剔時須籍𧖟蛾、將粘貼於蘭子上之剩餘部份啃剔、始能剝凈、故𧖟蛾厥為繅絲上之輔助品、不可或缺、是種𧖟蛾向藉絹絲廠供給、茲則上海華商絹絲廠、如信孚廠等均已、停工、</p>
<p>上海絲廠烏瞰</p>
<p>查上海全盛時期之絲廠、共有一百餘家、惟降至近年、業已式微、卽以今年春期開繅絲廠而言已祇三十餘家、茲則大部絲廠、淪陷戰區、其在安全地帶、充實其量不過十餘家而已、惟今年秋蘭已呈停滯現象、上項絲廠、亦有待各方恊助推動、使其開工繅製、</p>
<p>全浙蘭商集議</p>
<p>至浙省絲廠、總數共計三十餘家、除八家設於硤石•長安•嘉與•等鐵路區域、自亦無法開工、其餘均設在內地鄉鎮、現已由地方當局設法推動、期早開工、同時浙江全省蘭商、亦定本月十一日、在杭州焦棋杆繭聯會開會、討論調整絲繭辦法、國際貿易局繆鐘秀、暨絲藕業領袖褚慧僧、屆時均赴杭出席、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>敵人的冒險戰略</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>這幾天。北方戰報傳來。雖＝無深可扼腕。者而上海我軍陣綫則異常穩定。敵軍在蘇州河邊。連日遭遇。了堅強的抵抗。所蒙受的損失與犧牲。十分重大。卽使能在蘇州河南佔得寸士尺地。所付的代價也是不小的。</p>
<p>最近敵人冒着很大的危險。進犯找江浙邊境的海防。顯然是要打開上海戰事的僵局。現在登岸的敵人雖經我軍分頭堵截。多數殲滅。旦還有不少向北竄擾。這對於我軍的後路。不無相當的威脅。我們希望我軍事當局以最敏捷的手段。予以消滅。不使敵人的狡謀得逞。</p>
<p>同時。我們從這批敵人的登岸。不禁想到沿海民衆的組織和訓練更有加緊注意的必要困為我國海岸綫極長决不能到處配置着重兵非靠民衆自衛的力量。很難阻止敵人的乘虛侵襲。金山衛等處本不是容易上岸的地方。如果當地的漁民鹽民早有嚴密的組織。一方杜絕漢奸活動。一方協諜報的工作。則敵人是决無上岸的可能的。</p>

<h3>（瑣評）</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>金山衛爲有明倭寇侵擾故道。而爲今日滬杭公路要區。自應有重兵駐守。且該地沙灘。異常遼闊。巨形敵艦。無法駛入。何竟被敵軍乘拂曉大霧之中。得以安然登陸。現在敵軍已至葉榭。松隱。張堰。洙涇等處。浦南之地。幾盡爲敵所佔。倘再直趨楓涇嘉善嘉興。則一面可以截斷浦東我軍之後路。一面可以控制蘇嘉鐵路之要區。萬一被敵渡浦而北。則非特松江靑浦。盡爲敵擾。而淞滬一帶之我軍。亦均被敵軍威脅之中。務望我軍當局。從速往援。迎頭痛聲。肅淸殘寇。則亡羊補牢。或未爲晚。</p>

<h3>到前線途中（績）</h3>
<p>— 中央社戰地特派員通訊　侍桁</p>
<p>這次轟炸的目標、據說就是陸軍醫院、因為在醫院裏收留過傷兵的緣故、已經三番五次、敵機在追跡着傷兵醫院了、這是多麼醜惡的行為呀、在所謂“×國×單”的軍譽上、這是永也洗不淸的汚點呢、想想吧、着骨灰與傷兵在船頂上畫着大紅十字、於是便可以安然渡海的那些艦船吧、</p>
<p>因爲炸彈的提示我們、去訪問傷兵醫院、可不是那剛被炸過的地方、那裹早已經移空了、院長攀登峯先生很誠摯地招待了我們、並且詳細地講述了院方的組織、士兵的待遇、以及目前的情况、隨後更派人領導我們去參觀各病房、我彷彿看見過許多記述、關於傷兵或傷兵醫院的文字、大抵都是很興奮的、總是聽見傷兵在發着夢囈、“殺呀、殺呀、前進殺敵呀、”而使用一些過於誇張的表現、這事或許偶然是眞實的、恐怕並不總是如此、至少我並沒有聽見我在病房裏所得到的、正是與那種極度興奮相反的不同的感覺、</p>
<p>我一走進病房裹、便被一種寗靜而嚴肅的氣象籠罩住、這氣氛像是一種催淚彈、使我的眼淚滾滾着淚珠了、我從來不愛兵士、因為我從來沒有看見過他們的可愛的一面、現在天啟示我、使我在他們的平和與安靜中發現了他們的善良的本質、我簡直忘却了我到那裹的任務、我忘却了作為一個新聞記者、在事先所準備下的許多無味的辭令、我非常抱歉、我們的“慰勞、”實在是攪擾了、那對於他們是非常珍貴的安息、</p>
<p>最初他們看見我們進來、很顯示出	驚愕與不安的樣子、經那位引路的副官、把我們的來意說明之後、他們以那麼謙遜而羞赧的微笑歡迎了我們、我們的“慰勞，”還沒有交出他們先向我們道謝了、他們好像對他們的受傷、感着慚愧似地不願談說什麼、同時我們也感到一種難於形容出來的不好意思、問不出什麼、當記者的本來最應當有談話的藝術的、可是現在這種藝術不曉得溜到那國裹去了、費了好大的努力、當雙方都忘了自己的時候、才漸漸親密地暢談起來、一個左肩被槍彈射穿的營長對我們講了些滄州戰役的段片、另一個腿部受傷從淞滬訪綫退下來的士兵、講了些淞滬前綫的情形、這些談話、我想都沒有記下來的必要、因為是非常零碎的、比這些談話更可寶貴的、倒是他們談話時、那種情景、那像是一幅偉大的畫家的圖畫、將永久地刻在我的心靈上、（未完）</p>

<h3>抗戰</h3>
<p>— 趙力行</p>
<p>全面抗戰至今，轉瞬已是三四月了，自戰事開始至今，我們的𤍠血，無時不在沸騰着；我們的戰士，無處不以血肉之軀，與敵人周旋。使全世界知道愛好和平的中國為不堪侵略而抗戰了。</p>
<p>戰爭是可恥的，但是屈伏於武力之下，更是可恥；和平是可貴的，但是自衛的戰爭，更加可貴。我國因為過於愛好和平，便造成百年來喪權辱國種種不幸事仲。</p>
<p>自九一八至今，政府對於暴日的每次讓步，足示我國的愛好和平，與努力爲和平斡旋的苦心。可是到了忍無可忍的地步，自然不得不犧牲和平，以圖生存。蔣委員長曾經說過，“和平非到絕望時期，不輕言犧牲，”更可見我國自始至終對於和平的立塲。</p>
<p>日人所期望的是不抵抗。所採用的是各個擊破。屢次試用，屢次均獲成功。東三省於數日內完全佔領，𤍠河察哈爾又不勞而獲。都是因為我國沒有達到完全精神團結，各將領各為保全自己實力所致。</p>
<p>西安事變，兩廣事件的和平解决，無非各方鉅袖，鍳於暴日侵略口極，不能再行自相殘殺的結果。而我國亦自這二事後，全國日益精神團結，抗日情形日益高漲。同時日人之侵略也日甚一日，成這“不抗日便是死反之抗日才有生路”的局面、蘆溝橋日軍一再無理，自然不得不起而抵抗。</p>
<p>抗戰至今，短短數日，已給予日帝國主義知道吾國之不可侮。欲征服我國，非長期戰不可。日帝國主義經濟能力之薄弱，士兵之厭戰，工商農業之破產，人力財力，俱覺困難，使我人知日帝國主義長期戰之不可能。反之，我國人口衆多。土地廣大。物產豊富。使我人知道，我國定能作長期戰。所以勝利之屬於我，較日人為多。</p>
<p>百年來的恥辱，從此次抗戰中算一大淸帳；歷年來的損失，可從此次抗戰中討還來，抗戰！抗戰！歷年來恥辱的洗滌，損失的償還，新中國的造成正義的保存，端賴着你。</p>

<h3>Application to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Sent to the Tokyo Government</h3>
<p>The draft underwent several revisions, finally reaching a compromise yesterday morning. Awaiting Japan's response, the conference adjourned until Tuesday.</p>
<p>Beijing - The Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a plenary session this morning and passed a revised draft of the application to Japan. The content included points regarding Japan's statement in its reply to the Belgian government's request, claiming that Japan had no territorial ambitions and was willing to cooperate economically with China. It also included China's claim that Japan was engaging in hostile acts, disregarding the obligations of the Nine-Power Treaty, and undermining China's territorial integrity. The statement declared that both parties should attend the conference according to treaty obligations, but Japan had not participated. Therefore, the conference hoped that Japan would join to discuss methods of reconciliation. During this morning's meeting, the Italian representative spoke, saying that the new draft was better than the one proposed yesterday. After the meeting, the application was immediately delivered to the Japanese Ambassador to Belgium and telegraphed to the Belgian Ambassador to Japan for forwarding to the Japanese government. The U.S. Chief Representative, Davis, proposed that the conference be adjourned until Tuesday to await Japan's reply. (Central News Agency dispatch from Beijing, 6th)</p>
<p>Beijing - One section of the application sent by the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to the Japanese government pointed out that all armed conflicts are of a universal nature and cannot be limited to local areas. This wording was included to satisfy the United States. On this point, the representatives of Belgium, France, Britain, and the United States first reached an agreement within the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and finally consulted with the Italian representative, Count Macordi, who also agreed a few minutes later. The entire application was not much different from the original draft prepared after the amendments discussed by the delegations last night. The original Italian draft included Japan's accusations against China, but did not include China's accusations against Japan. The Chinese delegation raised objections, and subsequently both Chinese and Japanese mutual accusations were included, which was satisfactory to the Chinese delegation. (Havas dispatch from Beijing, 6th)</p>
<p>Beijing - The representatives of Britain, France, Belgium, and the United States attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a meeting at 9:00 a.m. at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the application to be sent to the Japanese government. The U.S. Chief Representative, Davis, requested that the principle of "international disputes should not be resolved by force" be included in the application. After two hours of discussion by the four representatives, they failed to reach a consensus. Subsequently, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference held a closed-door meeting at 11:00 a.m. to continue the discussion, and finally reached a compromise. Most of the national representatives expressed objections to the amendment proposed by the U.S. representative. They believed that the principle of "international disputes should not be resolved by force" was sufficient to cause disputes in the past and that if this principle were added to the application, Japan would regard it as another condemnation of Japan's actions, thereby preventing Japan from negotiating with the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. However, after the representatives exchanged views, the U.S. representative's amendment was still included, but the wording was slightly softened. At 1:50 p.m., the Italian representative, Count Macordi, announced that a compromise had been reached regarding the entire application, which would be delivered to the Japanese government in the afternoon and then released to the press at 6:00 p.m. (Havas dispatch from Beijing, 6th)</p>
<p>Beijing - The Secretariat of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference recently issued a communiqué stating: "The fifth meeting of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference at 11:00 a.m. this morning has finalized the text of the application to Japan decided yesterday. This application will be immediately delivered to the Japanese government by the Belgian Ambassador to Japan, and at the same time, the Secretary-General of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will deliver it to the Japanese Ambassador to Belgium." The original text of the application will be released to the press at 6:00 p.m. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is scheduled to hold a meeting next Tuesday morning, at which time it is hoped that the Japanese government's reply can be delivered. If Japan accepts negotiations with a smaller committee, the participating national representatives have already begun exchanging views on how that committee should be organized.

<h3>No Room for Peace Talks Unless Japan Changes Its Policy</h3>
<p>Confident in having sufficient strength for a long-term war of resistance, our delegation denies that Germany will mediate.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Foreign newspapers have spread rumors that the Sino-Japanese incident is being mediated outside the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. According to a spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this is absolutely untrue. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] In recent days, foreigners have been spreading rumors that China and Japan are about to negotiate peace and cease hostilities. According to official sources obtained by the Associated Press, these rumors are absolutely unfounded. At the same time, according to military observers familiar with the situation, China has sufficient strength to resist the Japanese invasion for a long period of time. The so-called peace talks are out of the question. According to a responsible Chinese authority who spoke to the Associated Press, to negotiate peace with Japan today would be an act of treason. The authority also stated that no foreign country has made such a suggestion to China. All members of the government are united in the opinion that there is no room for peace talks unless Japan changes its policy towards China. (National Telegram from the 6th)</p>
<p>Beijing - Japanese propaganda agencies are spreading rumors, even claiming that German leader Hitler will step forward to mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute. It has been determined that the Japanese side's intention in this propaganda is to disrupt the opinions of the national representatives attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference and obstruct the work of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. The spokesperson of our country's delegation to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference firmly denied the above statement on the evening of the 5th, and stated that our country's ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, had just arrived in Beijing from Germany, and was responsible for stating that the above news was purely a fabrication and not a word of it was credible. (Central News Agency dispatch from Beijing, 6th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to reliable sources, German leader Hitler intends to mediate the Sino-Japanese war, but is currently awaiting a response from the Italian side. This matter will likely become clearer once Ribbentrop returns here from Rome. (National Telegram from the 5th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the talk of Germany mediating the conflict between China and Japan, well-informed sources recently stated that the German government is currently considering the possibility of mediation. As of now, nothing has been initiated, and it is unlikely to become a reality in the near future. Well-informed sources also stated that it would be better for Germany to mediate than for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference to mediate, because most of the countries attending the Nine-Power Treaty Conference have less connection with the Far East. Regarding this matter, it is heard that the diplomatic authorities of Germany and Japan will soon begin to make contact. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Brussels - The diplomatic community here was quite shaken upon hearing about the German government mediating the dispute between China and Japan. Well-informed sources recalled that when Germany previously refused to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it had stated, "Whenever certain indispensable prerequisites are met, Germany will be prepared to cooperate in order to peacefully resolve the dispute between China and Japan." Therefore, they are all asking whether Germany is waiting for a favorable opportunity to conduct arbitration work independently. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese dispute, Germany has not expressed any ill will towards China. Although German diplomatic authorities also hope to act alone and succeed in order to make collective action appear inferior, since Germany and Japan have already established an anti-communist accord, Germany is no longer qualified to arbitrate in the Sino-Japanese dispute. In addition, Germany is afraid to directly initiate something that would put it in opposition to Britain and the United States, so the proposal for mediation may not become a reality. The Chinese delegation has heard nothing about the mediation proposal. The diplomatic community in Beijing also believes that China relies on collective action to confront Japan and will not accept the mediation proposal, thereby going against Britain and the United States. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 5th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the talk of Germany mediating the dispute between China and Japan, U.S. State Department personnel recently stated that they have no knowledge of it here. Semi-official sources said that the United States would not object if Germany were to mediate, but based on the latest news from Berlin and Tokyo, most people believe that the German mediation proposal is unlikely to materialize.

<h3>Previous Day's Conference Discussion</h3>
<p>Various representatives submitted amendments.</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing discussed the draft application to be sent to the Japanese government today, but failed to reach a compromise. As a result, it was agreed that the representatives of various countries should submit amendments to the conference secretariat separately, based on which a new draft would be prepared and submitted to the plenary meeting before noon tomorrow for a decision. According to the original drafter, Spartz, chairman of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, originally hoped to negotiate with Japan. Therefore, the initial draft of the application only quoted the words of Japan's note (i.e., the one issued on the 27th of last month refusing Belgium's invitation) regarding accusations against China. The Chinese Chief Representative, Gu Weijun, firmly opposed this at the meeting, stating that China government's complaints should also be cited at the same time, in order to show fairness. However, some people were afraid that this would hinder the compromising nature of the application and cause Japan to reject it again. Soviet representative Litvinov then advocated that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should send a note to Japan, asking it to engage in contact with the conference. It is not easy to attach a memorandum to state the arguments of both China and Japan. However, as a compromise, the representatives of various countries still could not agree. Finally, it was decided that the representatives of various countries should submit amendments in writing so that a new application could be drafted. By 6:00 p.m., the amendments submitted by all countries except Italy had been delivered separately. Belgian Chief Representative Spartz immediately prepared a new draft based on these amendments and jointly studied it with the representatives of Britain, the United States, and France at the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Once the Italian amendment is delivered, this new draft may still need to be revised accordingly, but it is not known. However, the general public hopes that there will not be any major changes. The amendments submitted by the main countries are described below: (1) The Chinese amendment insists that the application must also cite the complaints submitted by the Chinese government. Therefore, the new draft deleted the sections of Japan's note regarding accusations against China. (2) The Soviet amendment requested that the sections in the application involving communism be deleted, which has been done. (3) The French amendment proposed three points: (1) The application should state that once Japan's reply is delivered to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the national representatives should hold a plenary meeting to appoint a subcommittee to negotiate with the Japanese government. (2) It should be stated that China has accepted participation in the compromising procedures stipulated by the Nine-Power Treaty, which proves that the country does not oppose resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute by peaceful means. (3) Regarding the words "The national representatives purely exchange views within the scope of the Nine-Power Treaty" in the application, the word "purely" should be changed to "must," because the Soviet Union is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty. The new draft has largely adopted the above three opinions proposed by France. (4) The amendment proposed by U.S. Chief Representative Davis argued that the application should state clearly that it is impossible to limit the scope of any conflict to one corner of the world without expanding it. This amendment is based on President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago. The general public believes that this is the first time the United States has cited President Roosevelt's remarks in international diplomatic documents, so it is extremely important. It also said that the United States government is not as indifferent to international issues as it was before, which can also be proven. In addition, Davis firmly insisted that the application must refute Japan's reasons for refusing to attend the meeting, and should ask the Japanese government whether it intends to send personnel to attend the meeting or is willing to have contact with the future subcommittee. The representatives of Britain, France, the United States, and Belgium are scheduled to meet again at 9:15 a.m. tomorrow to study the Italian amendment and finalize the application at 11:00 a.m., which will be submitted to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference for discussion. If it can be passed by a vote at that time, it will be sent to the Japanese government under the name of Chairman Spartz.

<p>Brussels - General Jiang Baili and our Ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, arrived in Beijing together on the 5th. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Threatens to Declare War on Us</h3>
<p>Attempting to intimidate countries in the peace front in the hope of achieving direct negotiations.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Official sources here have stated that the Japanese government has not yet fully decided on whether to declare war on China or whether to form an "Imperial General Headquarters," but political figures believe that both are inevitable and that their realization is imminent. (Haitong Telegram from the 5th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The enemy has been spreading news of a declaration of war against us and the organization of a wartime headquarters for several days, creating a great stir and quite alarmist. According to an observer, regardless of whether these actions become a reality in the future, "at least at present, it is a smokescreen. The enemy is well aware of the international disputes caused by a formal declaration of war and the various disadvantages to itself. However, it was only after the United Kingdom and the United States expressed thorough cooperation on the Far East issue and the opening of the Beijing Conference that the propaganda of a formal declaration of war was spread. Its purpose is nothing more than to declare (1) that the dispute is becoming increasingly complex and the scope of the war will expand, in an attempt to intimidate peace-loving countries, and (2) to coerce the Beijing Conference into abandoning the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty or to convene a perfunctory meeting, so that China and Japan can negotiate directly outside the conference. The enemy's strategy, in addition to consistently propagating that the Sino-Japanese dispute will never be interfered with by third parties, is to ask its allies at the conference to strongly advocate direct negotiations. The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun published an article from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticizing the Beijing Conference, predicting that 'it will organize a subcommittee on the one hand to perfunctorily handle everything, and on the other hand, it will wait and see how the situation develops, and then come forward when an appropriate opportunity arises.' Therefore, it is making every effort to prevent 'the arrival of an appropriate opportunity,' which is why the atmosphere of declaring war against us and organizing a headquarters has become increasingly intense recently. As for our country, being invaded by the enemy and having diplomatic relations not yet severed, we have long suffered the pain of devastation. There is no difference between declaring or not declaring war. In addition to defending the territory of our country and resisting aggression and tyranny for the sake of human justice, we sincerely hope that peace-loving countries will not be misled by the enemy's propaganda, and we hope that the Beijing Conference will uphold the spirit of the Washington Conference and not let the Nine-Power Treaty become a piece of waste paper that is merely a historical precedent.

<h3>France and Siam Sign Treaty of Friendship</h3>
<p>Bangkok - The commercial, shipping, and friendship treaty between Siam and the French government was signed yesterday, along with an agreement between Siam and French Annam. This treaty is the second commercial agreement that Siam has concluded with the great powers. The first agreement, which was concluded with Japan, was signed last Tuesday. The agreement between Siam and Britain expired last week, and because of certain commercial issues, the two sides have not reached a consensus, and it has not been renewed. (Haitong News Agency dispatch from the 6th)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador to the United States Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Warning to aggressor countries</p>
<p>[New York] Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, delivered a speech today at Carnegie Hall during the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the Soviet Union, warning those military men in the world who want to compete with the Red Army on the battlefield that such a competition will result in the disastrous defeat of any superior power. He also said that aggressors are trying to establish a powerful spy network within the Soviet Union and are using backward elements to carry out their conspiracy to oppose the Soviet regime as a preparation for attacking the Soviet Union. However, these dregs have been purged by the Soviet authorities, and the Red Army is becoming stronger and stronger. As for the issues of China and Spain, they are not about communism. Many aggressor countries are shouting against communism, but in reality, they are using this as a smokescreen to cover up their attacks on other countries. In any case, the Soviet Union is now prepared for everything to defend its borders and wants to jointly maintain peace with all peace-loving countries.

<h3>Japan, Italy, and Germany Conspire Together: Anti-Comintern Pact Signed</h3>
<p>Italy and Germany express a neutral stance on the Sino-Japanese war.</p>
<p>[Rome] The Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan was signed this morning at 11:00 a.m. in the Victory Hall of the Chigi Palace by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, German Ambassador to the United Kingdom Ribbentrop, and Japanese Ambassador to Italy Horita. Many Italian government officials and personnel from the German and Japanese embassies were present to witness the ceremony. Hitler's confidant Hess was also among them. After the signing ceremony, Foreign Minister Ciano immediately delivered a speech, stating that the three great nations of Germany, Japan, and Italy are now united to defend against Bolshevism, but it must be stated that this pact has no other secret goals, does not oppose any country, and welcomes all countries to jointly participate in this practical tool that helps peace and civilization. Ambassador Ribbentrop then delivered a speech, stating that this pact has important historical significance, its purpose is only to prevent the threat of the Third International, to protect the lives and civilization of all countries, and it does not oppose any country. Ambassador Horita then spoke, saying that the representatives of Italy, Germany, and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact here today, hoping to strengthen common defense to deal with the threat of communism and protect the inherent civilization of the three countries, and he believes that it will definitely achieve satisfactory results. Foreign Minister Ciano, accompanied by Ambassadors Ribbentrop and Horiuchi, went to the Venice Palace to meet Prime Minister Mussolini, presented the text of the pact, and Mussolini expressed his satisfaction and explained the importance of this pact, and awarded the Grand Cross of Italy to Ambassadors Ribbentrop and Horita. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, the Italian government has reportedly expressed to the Chinese government that Italy does not assist Japan in the current Sino-Japanese conflict and maintains a completely neutral attitude. Although Italian newspapers have expressed sympathy to Japan, believing that Japan's actions in China are anti-communist in nature, the government has stated that it is willing to maintain friendship with both sides. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>[Paris] According to a dispatch from this morning's newspaper's correspondent in Rome, the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan appears to have the form of a military alliance treaty. The Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, fearing that world public opinion would misunderstand this move as an expression of sympathy for Japan's current policy toward China, has issued a guarantee to the Chinese Embassy in Italy, reiterating mutual friendship. The German Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also issued the same guarantee to the Chinese Embassy. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<p>Full Text of the Pact</p>
<p>[Rome] Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact today. The pact consists of four articles in addition to the preamble. An excerpt of the full text is translated as follows:</p>
<p>Preamble The governments of Italy, Germany, and Japan believe that the Communist International harms the civilized world of the West and the East, disturbs and destroys peace and order, and has no intention of stopping. They believe that all countries concerned with maintaining peace and order must cooperate closely to eliminate this scourge. They also believe that Italy had previously used unwavering determination to eliminate this scourge, eliminate the power of the Communist International within Italy, and establish the Fascist system. Later, Germany and Japan followed Italy's example and used the same determination to eliminate the power of the Communist International. Therefore, Italy should also join one of the sides of Germany and Japan to fight against the common enemy. Therefore, the three governments, in accordance with Article 2 of the Anti-Comintern Agreement concluded by Germany and Japan in Berlin on November 25, 1936, have agreed to conclude the following articles:</p>
<p>Article 1 Italy joins the Anti-Comintern Agreement of November 25, 1936, and its supplementary protocol.</p>
<p>Article 2 The three governments have agreed to recognize Italy as the original signatory of the Anti-Comintern Agreement and its supplementary protocol.</p>
<p>Article 3 This pact shall become an integral part of the Anti-Comintern Agreement and its supplementary protocol referred to in Article 1.</p>
<p>Article 4 This pact shall be written in the German, Italian, and Japanese languages respectively and shall have equal legal effect. It shall take effect from the date of signature.</p>
<p>According to the Anti-Comintern Agreement between Germany and Japan established on November 25 last year, which is mentioned in this pact, there are three articles: (1) The signatory parties shall exchange information on the activities of the Communist International and consult together on common defense measures. (2) Any country that feels threatened by the Communist International shall be contacted by the signatory parties to take defense measures or join this agreement in accordance with the spirit of this agreement. (3) This agreement shall be valid for five years. In addition, the supplementary protocol stipulates various practical methods of anti-communism, such as establishing a permanent joint committee to exchange news about the activities of the Communist International. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Expresses Satisfaction</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Political figures are deeply satisfied with Italy's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, believing that this move not only enhances the political axis of Germany and Italy, but also enhances the relationship between Japan and Italy. However, Germany and Italy's joining the Anti-Comintern Agreement is not an unfriendly expression to China. It is reported that before the Chinese Ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, departed for Beijing a few days ago, the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed him of the content of this agreement and repeatedly comforted him. The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Mushakoji, also gave a speech to the press, expressing satisfaction with the signing of this agreement and hoping that other countries would also sign it and join it. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Comment</h3>
<p>[Rome] The Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia published an article by Gaetada, saying that the people united by the Anti-Comintern Agreement of Germany, Italy, and Japan total 300 million, with approximately 2 million tons of warships. The armed forces of the three countries form a solid warning, giving the political action completed today great significance. In addition to the union of 200 million people, there are tens of millions of friendly comrades in Europe and Asia. They have solid unity in domestic politics and firm will in international affairs, and can reunite 2 million tons of warships. This number is currently gradually increasing. (Reuters dispatch from Central News Agency, 6th)</p>
<h3>Hirota Believes it is Necessary</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Foreign Minister Hirota published an article today, stating that since November 25 last year, the governments of Japan and Germany have believed that Italy's joining the Anti-Comintern Agreement is necessary in order to increase the efficiency of fulfilling their noble mission of safeguarding world peace and civilization. Due to the wise decision of Mussolini and Ciano, the current tripartite agreement has been signed, and Italy is participating in anti-communism with the qualifications of the original signatory, which the Japanese people are extremely pleased with. He believes that the German people also feel the same way. German Ambassador to Japan, Sackson, also expressed Germany's satisfaction with Italy's accession. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>London is Quite Critical</h3>
<p>[London] Regarding the Anti-Comintern Pact signed by Germany, Italy, and Japan today, political figures here have commented on the Anti-Comintern Pact between Germany, Italy, and Japan, saying that the purpose of this pact is to increase Italy's value as a scapegoat. They also believe that this pact is particularly ill-timed and deeply regrettable, because it is not enough to ease international tensions, but creates an ideological group, which is most abhorred by the British people. Political figures also stated that this pact was handled and signed by the German Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Ribbentrop, which is particularly unwelcome to the British people. Italy itself is not threatened by communism, but it is now joining the Anti-Comintern Agreement. Its intention is not to oppose communism, but to enhance Italy's psychological position.

<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates October Revolution Anniversary Today</h3>
<p>Successful Socialist Construction: Great Victory of the Last Twenty Years</p>
<p>[Moscow] The All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions of the Soviet Union previously sent invitations to representatives of various countries to come to the Soviet Union to participate in the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the October Revolution. It is now reported that representatives from Britain, the United States, France, Czechoslovakia, Mexico, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, the Netherlands, Argentina, Chile, Australia, Canada, Cuba, Mongolia, and other countries, totaling approximately 200 people, will arrive here. These representatives are selected by trade unions, cultural and educational institutions, and Soviet friendship associations of various countries. (TASS dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Rapid Industrial Progress</p>
<p>The success of the great Stalin Five-Year Plans has brought about a thorough change in the Soviet Union. The backward agricultural country of Russia has now become an independent, progressive, strong, industrialized socialist country. The technical reconstruction of the entire national economy of the Soviet Union has been completed by the 20th anniversary of the great October Revolution. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, a powerful socialist industry has been created. Currently, three-quarters of the total industrial output of the Soviet Union is produced by factories and plants established by the Soviet government. The current industrial production of the Soviet Union is fifteen times greater than before the 1917 revolution. In 1936, the total amount of steel produced by the three major Soviet iron and steel plants, Magnitogorsk, Kuznetsk, and Makeyevka, was equal to the total amount of steel produced by the entire Russian iron and steel industry under the Tsarist regime. The Soviet Union now ranks first in Europe and second in the world in terms of industry. The discovered coal reserves in the Soviet Union have increased seven and a half times. During the Tsarist era, the total discovered iron ore reserves in the country were only 150 million tons, but now they have increased to 25 billion tons. Furthermore, in terms of total electricity production, Tsarist Russia ranked last among the major countries of the world. However, after the implementation of two Five-Year Plans, the Soviet Union has built dozens of huge power stations. The electricity produced by the Dnieper Hydroelectric Station alone in 1936 was more than the total electricity produced by all power stations during the Tsarist era. The total electricity production in the same year exceeded sixteen times the total production before the war. The total electricity production of the Soviet Union now ranks second in Europe and third in the world. Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, the Soviet Union has become a huge railway nation, and the length of railway lines has increased by one and a half times, now totaling 85,000 kilometers. During the Tsarist era, there was no air transport at all, but in 1936, the Soviet Union's air routes reached 110,000 kilometers. The entire appearance of the Soviet Union has now completely changed. Two first-class giant canals have been completed, making Moscow a port accessible to five seas.</p>
<p>Achievements in Collective Agriculture</p>
<p>Two hundred and thirty new cities have been built across the country. The scenes of the old rural towns in Russia before the revolution were very depressing. The wooden plow was the main production tool. The land owned by 10 million peasant households was equal to that owned by 28,000 landlords. After the revolution, agriculture underwent a thorough reform, and the peasants chose the path of collectivized socialism. Soviet socialist agriculture is the largest and most powerful in the world, and it is also the most technologically advanced in terms of equipment. Currently, the area cultivated by collective farms and state-owned farms accounts for 99.1% of the total cultivated land. The number of tractors and tractor stations has exceeded 356,000, and the total volume of tractor operations has exceeded that of the United States by more than one time. The income of collective farms has increased rapidly, almost doubling in the past two years. The harvest of Soviet farms has also greatly increased, with a total of approximately 700 million poods in 1937 (each pood is approximately 36 pounds). The total agricultural production has doubled compared to before the war. The reason why culture in the Soviet countryside can be widely developed to an extent unimaginable in other countries, and the way of work and life in socialist villages and towns can increasingly approach that of socialist cities, is entirely based on collective farms and state-owned farms as the cornerstone.</p>
<p>Improving Workers' Lives</p>
<p>Every citizen in the Soviet Union has the right to work, the guarantee of obtaining employment, and the right to be compensated according to the quality and quantity of their work. They enjoy the shortest working hours in the world, and the law also stipulates that they have the right to rest. All workers and employees in the Soviet Union have annual vacations, and their salaries are still paid.</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of workers, the Soviet government has established sanatoriums, rest homes, clubs, etc., all over the country for them to live in free of charge. Every citizen has the right to be supported when they are old, sick, or lose their ability to work. In order to guarantee this right, free medical services and state-funded social insurance are being widely developed. This right has now been realized in the Soviet Union, and the scope is unprecedented in history. The welfare of the people is now being rapidly improved. Unemployment and poverty have disappeared forever in the Soviet Union. In 1925, the income of the people was only 17 billion rubles, but in 1937 it has exceeded 100 billion rubles, and all the income is used to improve the lives of the working masses themselves, to build factories and plants, to build beautiful and suitable housing, schools, colleges, theaters, clubs, and to consolidate the country's national defense. The total amount of wages has increased from 8 billion rubles in 1928 to 70 billion rubles. At the same time, the purchasing power of the Soviet ruble is also increasing year by year.</p>
<p>Raising Cultural Standards</p>
<p>The cultural level of the Soviet labor force is being rapidly improved. The most obvious example is the eradication of illiteracy. In the Soviet Union, education is the right of everyone, and the law stipulates that children must receive free compulsory education. In 1936, the Soviet Union had 170,000 primary schools and 2,572 specialized schools. Among the workers working in large-scale industrial sectors, two-thirds have industrial science degrees. In the past eight years, the number of engineers and technicians has increased from 92,000 to 580,000. In the modern scientific community, Soviet scientists have advanced to the forefront due to their inventions and achievements. (TASS)</p>
<h3>Germany and Poland Conclude Minority Agreement</h3>
<p>Relations Between the Two Countries Become Closer: Hitler Will Visit Danzig</p>
<p>[Berlin] The governments of Germany and Poland simultaneously issued a declaration at 7:00 PM today, announcing the agreement concluded between the two countries regarding the issue of ethnic minorities within their respective borders. It stated: "The governments of Germany and Poland believe that the issue of the treatment of ethnic minorities within their respective borders is of utmost importance to the friendship between the two countries. Therefore, they have conducted negotiations to resolve this issue. The results of the negotiations prove that the two countries have the same views on this issue, namely: (1) The German and Polish nations respect each other and should not deny the existence of the issue of the treatment of ethnic minorities within their respective borders, and should not impose any oppression on ethnic minorities within their respective borders, especially the youth. (2) Ethnic minorities within their respective borders should enjoy the following freedoms: (A) Freedom to use their native language; (B) Freedom of assembly; (C) Freedom to establish schools and organize religious groups; (D) The right to economic equality with citizens of the host country and the right to purchase real estate. (3) Ethnic minorities on both sides should remain absolutely loyal to the government of the host country." Chancellor Hitler also met with the Polish ambassador and informed him that he was very satisfied with the publication of this agreement. According to those in charge, Hitler told the Polish ambassador that the friendly relations between Germany and Poland should not be affected by the issue of the Free City of Danzig. In addition, Chancellor Hitler also received representatives of the German-Polish Association this morning, with Foreign Minister Neurath and Interior Minister Frick also in attendance. He told the representatives that he had ordered the release of the eighteen Poles recently arrested by the German authorities. After the announcement of the German-Polish declaration, the Polish Association also passed a resolution, believing that this declaration would further strengthen the friendly relations between Germany and Poland, and therefore expressed deep satisfaction.

<h3>Britain and the Netherlands Strengthen Far East Defenses</h3>
<p>Singapore Naval Base to Be Fully Completed Within Two Years: Dutch Naval and Air Forces Concentrated in East Indies Base</p>
<p>[Paris] Since the Chinese islands near French Indochina were occupied by the Japanese Navy, Southeast Asia has been threatened. Britain and the Netherlands are strengthening their navies in their colonies as a precautionary measure. The naval reporter of Le Petit Parisien, Mr. Rebrelier, recently commented that Britain's main concern is the safety of its territories in the Indian Ocean, and it may be necessary to blockade the Strait of Malacca. The construction of the Singapore naval base will not be completed until the end of 1939, and the cost will be more than 10 million pounds. The floating dock has now been deployed, and it can accommodate warships with a displacement of up to 55,000 tons. Once the entire project is completed, the British Grand Fleet in the Pacific will use Singapore as its base. In addition to the existing warships, five "Elizabethan" class battleships (27,500 tons) will also be sent there. As for the air force, there are already two airfields in Singapore, and two more will be added in the future. The defenses of Hong Kong will also be strengthened. In summary, the defenses of the British colonies in the Indian and Pacific Oceans will be fully completed by 1940, and the cost will be approximately 30 million pounds. On the Dutch side, the East Indies naval base will also be strengthened. This can be seen from the fact that the country's naval budget for 1938 has almost doubled compared to this year, reaching 37.2 million guilders. The warships currently concentrated in the East Indies include two 6,700-ton cruisers, namely the "Java" and "Sumatra," both equipped with six-inch caliber guns, and the 6,500-ton cruiser "De Ruyter," also equipped with the same guns. In addition, there are four destroyers, four submarines, and several gunboats and mine-laying ships. In the future, three cruisers, twelve destroyers, eighteen submarines, two small fleet leadership ships, and seventy-two naval aircraft will be added. The Dutch Navy has a total of twenty-eight submarines (with four more nearing completion), the newest of which is the "K XI," which recently sailed 23,500 nautical miles in the Indian Ocean, demonstrating its great range.

<h3>On the South Bank of the Suzhou River, We Still Hold Our Original Line of Defense</h3>
<p>Stalemate at Chichuan and Xuejiazhai: Enemy Fiercely Attacks Zhujia浜, Repelled: Enemy Attacks at Zhuyuan, Xiaonanxiang, Suffering Casualties</p>
<p>The battle on the south bank of the Suzhou River continued to be fiercely fought across the entire line yesterday, with simultaneous engagements on both the eastern and western flanks. On the eastern flank, after the enemy at Liujiazhai received reinforcements the night before, they fiercely attacked our positions at Chichuan and Xuejiazhai, but were ultimately repelled by our troops. Yesterday morning, they came again with reinforcements, and fierce fighting continued throughout the day. Only the southeast of Xuejiazhai was slightly infiltrated, but they were intercepted and surrounded by our troops. Fierce fighting is still ongoing this morning. On the western flank, the enemy forces divided their troops to attack westward, attacking our line at Tianduzhai and Chenjialong, attempting to threaten our army's Jiangqiao position on the north bank. They have been repelled by our troops. Our troops on the north bank are strictly preventing them from crossing to the north bank. The enemy forces in front of our Zhujia浜 launched six fierce attacks against us yesterday, but were all met with head-on blows by our troops. At this moment, our troops are still firmly defending the line from Zhujia浜 to Chenjialong and Tianduzhai. Any further attacks by the enemy will be met with heavy blows. In the Xiaonanxiang area, the fierce fighting at Zhuyuan continued to unfold yesterday. The enemy repeatedly attacked, but has been repelled. North of Guangfu, there was no major fighting. The enemy attacked our Xinzhai, suffering heavy casualties and retreating.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attack on Zhujia浜 Repelled</h3>
<p>Fierce Battle for a Day and Night: We Still Hold Our Original Line of Defense: Enemy Divided Troops to Attack Westward, Also Intercepted by Our Troops</p>
<p>Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 9:45 PM on the 6th that after the enemy forces in the area north of Zhujia浜 on the south bank of the western section of the Suzhou River forcibly occupied strongholds such as Caijiazhai and Yujidun, they continued to advance southwest. Since last night, they have shelled our Zhangjiangdu, Bazhiqiao, Qujiaqiao, Sijiao, Luotou, Xupu, and Chenjialong, resulting in extremely fierce fighting along the entire line of defense at Tianduzhai. Their infantry also continuously attacked. However, our troops calmly resisted, and after 24 hours of fierce fighting, we still held our original line of defense. At the time of the report, the sound of artillery fire gradually subsided, the battle had become quieter, and our line of defense had also stabilized.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks in Two Directions, Also Using Poison Gas</h3>
<p>The enemy's attack route was divided into two directions, one advancing westward to attack our positions at Sijiao, Luotou, and Xupu. After holding out for half the night, at about 3:00 AM this morning, the enemy's artillery suddenly concentrated on Sijiao, bombarding it fiercely. Our troops suffered some casualties, and the enemy forces pressed forward fiercely, so that place was almost breached. Fortunately, our troops fought desperately to resist, and reinforcements arrived on time, launching a courageous counterattack and repelling the enemy. Another route attacked our Bazhiqiao position to the south. Our troops relied on Zhujia浜 to defend the position, which was very solid. The enemy repeatedly attacked without success. At 4:00 PM today, the enemy disregarded international law and used tear gas. Our troops were caught off guard, and many were poisoned and fell unconscious, so the situation was very critical. However, the enemy did not dare to advance aggressively. By evening, the poison gas had dissipated, and reinforcements had filled the defenses, so the situation turned from danger to safety.</p>
<h3>Firmly Defending the Two Points on the Riverbank, Strictly Preventing the Enemy from Crossing North</h3>
<p>Our troops are still holding Tianduzhai and Chenjialong on the Suzhou River bank and east of Xupu to block the enemy's westward advance and prevent them from crossing to the north bank again to attack our positions west of Shenjihang. The enemy forces feel quite threatened by this, so their attacks are also extremely fierce. Those who attacked our Chenjialong were killed by us in the hundreds before the enemy retreated. They also repeatedly attacked Tianduzhai without success. As of 6:00 PM, our entire line was very stable. At around 7:00 PM, our artillery displayed its divine power, counterattacking the enemy's position, stopping after about two hours. The enemy forces suffered quite a few casualties.</p>

<h3>Enemy Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Shanghai West and Pudong</h3>
<p>Strafing of Chuanshang Passenger Car Injures Six: Continuous Reconnaissance Over Nanshi, No Bombs Dropped</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, two enemy planes circled and reconnoitered in the Yangjingzhen, Lan Nidu, and Yangjiadu areas of Pudong, dropping more than a dozen bombs and flying low over Lan Nidu and Yangjingzhen from time to time, strafing with machine guns. The losses are unknown. In the Shanghai West area, more than a dozen enemy heavy bombers flew to the Hongqiao Town and Beixinjing areas at around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, indiscriminately bombing, dropping no less than a hundred bombs one after another, before fleeing at around 10:00 AM. The losses are under investigation.</p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, three enemy planes circled and reconnoitered over Xinlu in Pudong. At that time, a Chuanshang Transportation Company passenger car arrived, and they strafed the passenger car with machine guns and dropped many bombs, but due to inaccurate targeting, none hit. Only six passengers were injured, and they were immediately bandaged by members of the 9th Rescue Team of the Red Cross Society and escorted to the hospital. Their lives may be saved, but the enemy planes' atrocities in massacring our innocent civilians are even more evident here.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the weather in the city cleared up, and nine enemy planes flew to various parts of Nanshi for reconnaissance, but they did not drop any bombs and flew over the French Concession towards Shanghai West. However, one of them was a single-winged giant seaplane with a bronze-colored fuselage, flying extremely low. According to the high altitude, the pilot and machine gunner's markings, etc., could be seen clearly. It is said that this is the first time the enemy has used this type of giant plane for reconnaissance in Nanshi.

<h3>Professor Haas of Harvard University Describes the Truth of Anti-War Sentiment in the Enemy Country</h3>
<p>Merchants and Industrialists Worry About Protracted War; Financial Difficulties May Lead to Labor Unrest</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Great American Evening News," Dr. Haas, a professor of international relations at Harvard University, recently spent three weeks in Japan. He wrote an article describing his observations of Japan's war preparations. One section states: "In 1914, the German government told its people that the war would not last beyond Christmas and called it a happy war. Even the most disciplined nation cannot expect its people to passively endure a long war without protest. Therefore, the Japanese government this time told its people that the war against China would only last a few weeks, that the Chinese were all cowards, and that their armies were all untrained mobs. Fearing that the people would not believe this, the Japanese authorities used films to prove it. The screen showed captured Chinese soldiers in a pathetic state with inferior weapons, and piles of old-fashioned guns and cannons captured from the Chinese army. The audience was elated and sometimes laughed heartily, thinking that victory could be achieved in a matter of moments and would definitely not be prolonged. A certain military officer in the audience, who had studied in the United States, asked me, 'What do you think of this?' The entire Japanese people do not want to fight, not just because it will be protracted. Merchants in Tokyo and Kobe, as well as people in the steel and textile industries, are clearly worried about the war. They cannot find foreign exchange, and the seasonal goods shipped from abroad cannot be withdrawn because there are no funds. Order contracts have been canceled. US dollars and British pounds are nowhere to be found, and all goods are subject to government control. The price of rice sold to consumers has risen by 20% in a few weeks, but the price sold to farmers has not risen. At the appropriate time, the import and export of rice would be sufficient to control the soaring prices, but now the retail prices already reflect the people's panic. Businesses are now worried about the occurrence of labor unrest. To keep the workers quiet, the families of workers who are drafted into the army can receive 50% to 75% of their daily wages. However, it is doubtful how long this method can be sustained. If the war is prolonged, the government and businesses will fall into financial difficulties. The daily increase in taxes is shocking. The burden of the military expenses of a long-term war falls on the shoulders of farmers and workers. Can they bear this heavy burden for long? It is worthy of contemplation. A certain textile manufacturer once exclaimed, 'What can our strength do?' A women's group of the upper class, who have worked for years to obtain the right to vote, also exclaimed, 'What can our strength do?' Three soldiers in Kobe opposed the war and planned to stage a demonstration at the crowded train station. At that time, the station was full of troops heading to the front lines. All three soldiers refused to depart and were eventually killed at the station. Every time a train departs, men and women, young and old, wave flags to send off their loved ones to war. But the loved ones being sent off do not want to abandon their families and go to war. Although they oppose it in their hearts, what ability do they have to express their opposition? The son of a cook at a vocational school in Kobe committed suicide because he was drafted into the army, unwilling to die on the battlefield."</p>
<h3>Brave Warrior Liao Baocai</h3>
<p>Overcoming All Difficulties to Repel the Enemy; A Model in the Army Becomes a Legend</p>
<p>A reporter from this newspaper interviewed Staff Officers Jiang and Guo of the XX Army XX Division yesterday, casually discussing the war situation at the front and trivial matters in the army. The two gentlemen recounted an event that was extremely valuable. They said, "There is a private named Liao Baocai in our army, a native of Zhenjiang, 32 years old. He has been in the army for many years, has experienced many battles, and is a burly and extraordinarily brave man. I remember on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, two battalions of our army were trapped by a regiment of the enemy near Luoyang Bridge, south of Xiaonanxiang, and were waiting for orders to break through. At that time, Liao climbed to the top of a tree to perform the duty of observation. He saw eight enemy soldiers advancing in search, no more than 200 feet from the array. He immediately landed and reported to the company commander, volunteering to kill the enemy alone, requesting to exchange the rifle he was carrying for a new-style rifle. The company commander replied that there was no need to rush into battle at this time, and to wait for later orders to charge. Liao's blood boiled over at that moment, and he could not restrain himself. He had no choice but to deal with the enemy with the original gun. When he was about tens of steps away from the enemy, he rushed forward alone, hitting the head of the enemy with the butt of the gun. The enemy fell to the ground. Two other enemies each grabbed his hand, intending to capture him alive. Liao, in a moment of desperation, used his wit and turned his head to bite the neck of the enemy on the right, severing the trachea, and the enemy immediately died. He then used his right hand to seize the pistol worn by the enemy on the left and stabbed the enemy's face with a bayonet. The enemy was injured in the face, fell to the ground in agony. The remaining three enemy soldiers, seeing that the situation was not good, fled backward. About a hundred steps away, the enemy also fired shots, hitting Liao's crotch, piercing a small hole, but the flesh was unharmed. After Liao completed his mission, he seized a light machine gun with 25 bullets, and two rifles with more than ten bullets. He also conveniently killed the wounded enemy soldier before returning to the team and reporting to the company commander. At that moment, cheers erupted. Shortly after, the higher authorities issued an emergency order, and after a fierce battle for a while, they were able to break through. There were some casualties. After that, Liao's achievement of fighting eight enemies alone spread throughout the army. Officers at all levels of the army, division, brigade, and regiment rewarded him one after another, awarding him more than a hundred yuan in prize money and promoting him one rank. Liao is worthy of being a role model for Chinese soldiers."</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Shell Red Cross Dormitory</h3>
<p>Last night, enemy ships shelled Pudong. Gao Hang Town was hit by many shells. Many houses on the streets were destroyed. The members of the Ninth Rescue Team of the Red Cross Society there had just finished their work and were preparing to go to bed to relieve the fatigue of the past few days and nights. Suddenly, a shell flew through the air and pierced the wall of the house. Shrapnel and gravel scattered in all directions. Fortunately, none of the team members were injured.</p>
<h3>Chih Chih Alumni Association Funds Purchase Government Bonds</h3>

<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Rescue Personnel Again</h3>
<p>Forty Boy Scouts Missing, Presumed Dead; Only the Driver Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the First Wartime Service Corps of the Chinese Boy Scouts (i.e., the Shanghai Boy Scouts) previously organized an office in Kunshan, with two teams of members responsible for rescue and other work. At 9:00 PM on the 4th, forty boy scouts, male and female, led by team leader Gu Fei, took the No. 49 ambulance of the Municipal Federation to Kunshan. When passing through XXX, they were suddenly discovered by three enemy planes, which flew low to reconnoiter. The car stopped, and all the boy scouts got out of the car and scattered, lying in the fields. The enemy planes circled for a long time, frequently strafing downward with machine guns and dropping two bombs, causing the ambulance to be riddled with bullet holes. The front of the car was destroyed, and only the seats remained in the rear. The forty boy scouts, male and female, are currently missing and presumed dead. One driver was killed on the spot, and another was unconscious for two hours before waking up.</p>

<h3>Enemy Troops Land at Jinshanwei; Our Troops Rush to Block Them</h3>
<p>Enemy Captures Zhangyan and Advances to Songyin Town; Encountering Fierce Resistance from Our Troops; Tuolin and Zhaopu Launch a Two-Pronged Attack; Enemy Ship in Hangzhou Bay Wounded by Cannon Fire</p>
<p>[Songjiang] Yesterday (the 5th), enemy troops took advantage of the deployment of our troops and landed at Jinshanwei in the early morning fog. They reached Caojing and were repelled by our troops. More than 40 enemy soldiers fled to the vicinity of Mijia Lane in Tinglin. A teacher at a primary school in Tinglin was once captured by enemy soldiers and bound. Fortunately, the teacher knew some Japanese and was released. The teacher was forced to guide them for a short distance and then escaped. Today (the 6th) at 6:00 or 7:00 AM, the enemy increased its troops and advanced, only six li away from Yexie Town. There were no military police there. Jiang Baigen, a teacher at the Sixth National Middle School, and Jiang Zhenqiu, a boy scout instructor, led the strong men in a brave resistance, but had to retreat due to lack of ammunition. Also, from 7:00 AM today, more than 40 enemy planes bombed Songjiang until about 1:00 PM. The better houses in the west station and inside and outside the city were destroyed. After the enemy planes left, gunfire was heard, seemingly near Mishi Ye, probably due to our troops pursuing them. It is said that many refugees were killed and injured, but it is still difficult to know the details. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] More than 20 enemy ships were deployed in Hangzhou Bay. At 2:00 AM on the 6th, they shelled our coast. We also returned fire with heavy artillery.

<p>[Hangzhou] At 4:30 AM on the morning of the 5th, many enemy ships were spotted in the waters off Jinshanwei. Starting at 7:00 AM, the enemy ships used aircraft, heavy artillery, and machine guns to cover more than 1,000 marines, who landed in the area of Quan Gong Ting and Jin Si Niang Bridge in Pinghu County. Our defending troops immediately launched a fierce attack. As of the time of the dispatch, they were still engaged in fierce fighting. The enemy and we are currently confronting each other at Xincang Town. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 5th) (Local News) According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter with the army at 9:45 PM on the 6th, in order to end the Shanghai war as soon as possible and remove the threat of our army in Pudong, the enemy reenacted the old trick of the bandits invading during the Jiajing year of the Ming Dynasty, landing yesterday morning in the Jinshanwei Jinshan Mouth area of Hangzhou Bay. Our troops rushed to intercept them upon receiving the alarm, but were unable to advance due to the intense artillery fire of the enemy ships and the abnormal activity of the enemy planes. The enemy troops occupied Quan Gong Ting and advanced north, meeting and joining forces with those advancing north from Jinshanwei Caojing Town at He Huang Dai last night. By noon today, they had captured Zhangyan Town, looting and setting fires, and continued to advance. By evening, their vanguard had reached Songyin Town, about four kilometers from the upstream of the Huangpu River at Chuanlai Temple, but had also encountered fierce resistance from our troops. The enemy's invasion of this area cannot be sustained without a strong force. The number of enemy troops landing is currently small, so although they have penetrated more than 20 kilometers, there is no need to worry. However, the civilians are suffering from their invasion, which is particularly hateful. Our army is not only strictly blocking the front, but also launching a two-pronged attack along the road from Tuolin and Zhaopu to cut off their retreat and block the landing of their reinforcements. The enemy who has penetrated deep will be surrounded on all sides and will surely be completely annihilated. It is firmly believed that this move by the enemy will not affect the Shanghai war situation. (Central News Agency)</p>

<p>[Jinan] On the right wing of the Jinpu Railway, the enemy who attacked Zhengjiazhai in Ling County on the 4th and 5th has been severely damaged after being attacked by our army. The remnants of the enemy have retreated to Fenghuangdian. Our army is still guarding the original front line of Zhengjiazhai Dong Caijia Fan Gezhai, about 30 li northwest of Linyi. A Central News Agency war zone reporter returned from an inspection of the front line in Linyi on the 6th. After learning about the battle on the 4th and 5th, a certain unit of our army had achieved considerable success. On the 4th, more than 400 enemy soldiers, infantry and artillery, attached with two tanks, advanced from Sanhui River in three routes, one attacking Zhengjiazhai, one attacking Dong Caijia near the village, and one attacking Xi Caijia, a neighboring village of Dong Caijia. The attack was very fierce. After a fierce battle from dawn to night on the 4th, they were repelled by us. However, the stubborn enemy attempted to break through the line and head straight for Linyi, so they continued to attack on the 5th, attacking our Gezhai positions northwest of Linyi, and sending planes to bomb the vicinity of Linyi to contain us. Our army responded in different ways, and finally defeated the enemy by the afternoon of the 5th. In total, more than 100 enemy soldiers were killed in the two days, and we also suffered considerable losses. When the reporter inspected the front line, he witnessed our loyal and brave soldiers using their flesh and blood to withstand intense artillery fire and defending their positions without retreating. In particular, the soldiers defending the Dong Caijia position responded calmly and were not afraid, which quickly turned the situation around. In addition, the local civilian self-defense forces also voluntarily participated in the battle. It is said that the Shandong Provincial authorities have sent telegrams to commend them and encourage them to continue their efforts to serve the country with this spirit. (Central Central Electricity)</p>

<h3>Current Situation in Kinmen</h3>
<p>[Xiamen] The enemy failed to convene a township assembly in Kinmen on the 4th, and a security maintenance committee could not be established. In reality, the committee members predetermined by the enemy, former Chamber of Commerce Chairman Wang Tingzhi, Xu Xingen, Chen Taiyi, Zhou Yong'an, Zhou Yongguo, etc., are presiding over the situation in their personal capacity, without a name. They have reorganized the Kinmen Local Police Team, with Zhuang Yunzhi as the captain and 20 team members, under the command of Wang, to maintain local order. They are collecting slaughter taxes and fish taxes to cover expenses. The enemy's army is still 300 strong. There are six or seven enemy ships off Kinmen and Xiamen Port. There are no enemy ships off Weitou. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Propaganda Uses Threat of Declaring War to Intimidate Peace-Loving Countries</h3>
<p>Coerces the Brussels Conference into a Perfunctory Affair; To Achieve Its Goal of Direct Negotiations</p>
<p>[Nanjing] In recent days, the enemy has been spreading news of declaring war on us and organizing a wartime headquarters, making a lot of noise and causing alarm. According to a certain observer, this kind of action by the enemy, regardless of whether it becomes a reality in the future, is at least a smokescreen for now. The enemy is not unaware of the international disputes and various disadvantages that a formal declaration of war would cause. However, after the United Kingdom and the United States expressed their thorough cooperation on the Far East issue and the Brussels Conference opened, they began to spread the news that they would formally declare war. The purpose is to show that ㊀ the disputes are becoming more and more complex, and the scope of the war will be expanded, in order to intimidate peace-loving countries, ㊁ to coerce the Brussels Conference into abandoning the spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty, or to make the meeting perfunctory, so that China and Japan can negotiate directly outside the conference. The enemy's strategy is to consistently propagate that the Sino-Japanese dispute should not be interfered with by third parties, and to ask its friendly countries at the conference to advocate direct negotiations. The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun once published an article by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticizing the prediction of the Brussels Conference, saying, "It will organize a subcommittee to perfunctorily deal with everything, while observing the development of the situation, and then come forward when there is an appropriate opportunity." Therefore, it is trying its best to prevent the arrival of the "appropriate opportunity." This is why the atmosphere of declaring war on us and organizing a wartime headquarters has become increasingly strong recently. As for our country, we have been subjected to enemy aggression and national relations have not been severed. We have long suffered the pain of destruction. Whether or not to declare war makes no difference. In addition to resisting aggression and tyranny to defend our national territory and human justice, we sincerely hope that peace-loving countries will not be misled by enemy propaganda, and we hope that the Brussels Conference will uphold the spirit of the Washington Conference and not allow the Nine-Power Treaty to become a scrap of paper in history.

<h3>Commemoration of the Soviet October Revolution's Anniversary</h3>
<p>TASS Hosts Press</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The 7th marked the 20th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. The Soviet Embassy in Nanjing, due to the war, announced some days ago that it would not hold a reception. Instead, the Soviet TASS news agency held a tea party at its office at 4 PM on the 6th, inviting members of the press from China and abroad in the capital. More than 20 people attended, including Xiao Tongzi. Sun Ke, head of the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, also sent a long letter to Mr. Melamed, the Soviet Embassy's chargé d'affaires. Besides expressing his regret for not being able to personally offer his congratulations, he recalled that in 1917, Lenin and in 1911, Sun Yat-sen respectively led two major modern revolutions, laying a bright foundation for the survival and struggle of the world's oppressed classes and weak nations, creating one of the most glorious pages in the history of human liberation. The letter also stated that in the past decade or so, due to the close relationship between China and the Soviet Union in terms of territorial proximity, politics, economy, and culture, the two countries have cooperated and struggled together to uphold world justice and humanitarianism, thereby deepening their friendly relations. Now, as Japanese imperialism has launched a war of aggression against China, threatening peace in the Far East and the world, and attempting to achieve its ambitions of continental policy, China is preparing for national resistance, and hopes that China and the Soviet Union will earnestly join hands and strive for world justice, humanity, and peace.

<h3>Enemy Uses False Pretenses to Print and Distribute Books</h3>
<p>Central Government Issues Order for Investigation and Prohibition</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Recently, Japanese individuals have been using the name of the Chinese Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) to print various books and pamphlets of a seditious nature in a printing house on Zhapu Road, Shanghai, falsely claiming that they were published by the Commercial Press or other major publishing houses. The content fabricated stories of the Chinese Nationalist Party inciting the public to expand anti-foreign and anti-French movements, while also advising the public to study communism. They prepared to print and distribute these materials in Shanghai and inland China. The purpose of distributing these reactionary publications is clearly to use anti-foreign sentiments to slander the Chinese Nationalist Party, and thereby prove that Japan's dispatch of troops to China is to protect foreign residents and the interests of various countries in China. It is reported that in order to prevent this enemy conspiracy, the Central Government has issued a general order to investigate and prohibit the above-mentioned reactionary publications published under the false name of the Chinese Nationalist Party.

<h3>International Red Cross Committee Facilitates the Establishment of a Safety Zone in Nanshi</h3>
<p>Father Jacquinot Explains the Significance of the Proposal; Concerned Parties Understand and Safeguard Humanitarianism</p>
<p>The Shanghai "North-China Daily News" reports that after several days of negotiations between the International Red Cross Committee and the Chinese and Japanese authorities, the establishment of a safety zone in Nanshi has finally succeeded. Last night (the 5th), an agreement was signed by both the Chinese and Japanese sides and the committee. The details are not yet known. It is reported that the area includes the old county town north of Fangbang Road. Yesterday, Father Jacquinot, chairman of the committee, issued a statement regarding the plan, saying: "In recent days, newspapers have carried several articles regarding the discussions between the Chinese and Japanese authorities and myself (chairman of the International Red Cross Committee) and the Japanese authorities and myself on establishing a safety zone in Nanshi for Chinese non-combatant residents, which has caused misunderstandings. It seems appropriate to explain and correct these now, and to prevent or eliminate any concerns arising therefrom. The area is a safe residence for civilians in Nanshi and is not a neutral zone, because it is neither neutral nor a zone. It cannot be called a demilitarized zone. The proposal was certainly not made for the benefit of the French, nor to preserve the property of the Church in Nanshi. I do not know if there is any Church property there. This is purely a safety zone for non-combatants, because both Japan and China, for humanitarian reasons, are willing to protect non-combatants. This is how the initiative was able to succeed. I am well aware that this method is an innovation, and I hope that it can be imitated in places like Europe, as it will be of great benefit. I trust you will not dismiss my words as nonsense."</p>
<p>The Shanghai "Times" reports that the agreement on the non-combatant safety zone in Nanshi was reportedly signed last night at 7:00 PM by the parties concerned. Thus, the efforts of international groups who have been working for humanitarianism for many days have succeeded. The content was not yet known last night and will reportedly be discussed at a meeting this morning to make a final decision. The main point is the issue of policing in the area. The initiator of this initiative was the International Red Cross, and Father Jacquinot worked the hardest. Although it has been going on behind the scenes for many days, its nature was only announced three days ago. The area is bounded by Fangbang Road to the south and the French Concession on the other three sides. It will not be used for any military activity and can accommodate a large number of Chinese refugees.</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reports that the non-combatant safety zone in Nanshi was not established by an agreement between China and Japan, but only approved the application of the refugee relief committee by both parties. Members of the committee include Mr. Plant, Mr. Andrew, Mr. MacNaghten, Mr. Bapord, Mr. Gaspar, and Mr. Balenz.</p>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that a spokesman for the Japanese Embassy stated this morning (the 6th) when meeting with news reporters about the Nanshi civilian safety zone that this measure is only a transitional one. Although the principles of the agreement have been negotiated, they have not yet been signed. Last night, the Japanese authorities sent a letter to the International Red Cross Committee for Refugee Relief. Once they receive Father Jacquinot's reply, the Japanese authorities will consider implementing the agreement. It is also reported that the issue of policing in the area has been resolved. Therefore, the establishment of the area will be announced this morning. It is reported that the policing within the area will still be the responsibility of the Shanghai Municipal Government Police Bureau. The Chinese authorities have firmly stated that they have not signed any agreement on the demarcation of the area. This matter is being handled by the International Committee in consultation with both China and Japan. Once an agreement is reached, the committee will issue a statement announcing the establishment of the area, along with a map showing the boundaries of the safety zone.</p>
<p>A reporter from the China East News Agency visited Father Jacquinot, who proposed the establishment of the refugee area, at Aurora University yesterday. Father Jacquinot, who had his right arm broken, shook hands with the reporter with his left hand and answered the reporter's questions in fluent English. According to him, since the start of the Shanghai war, international refugee shelters have been doing their best to accommodate refugees. In Xujiahui alone, it is necessary to provide food for 7,000 people per meal. Nanyang University has also accommodated nearly 3,000 people. Three new shelters are now being built, one capable of accommodating 5,000 refugees and another capable of accommodating 3,000. He also said that with the retreat of Chinese troops from Zhabei, the number of refugees has increased again. With the weather turning cold these days, what will happen if they are not accommodated? Therefore, I first requested the Chinese side to demarcate a refugee area in southern Shanghai, which the Chinese side has understood. Then, I contacted the Japanese side again, and the Japanese side also understands now. In a day or two, everything can be properly arranged. Afterwards, the residents of the area can avoid all dangers of war. If there is vacant space in the area, and there are many refugees in the concession who cannot continue to be accommodated, then arrangements can be made to accommodate them there.</p>
<p>According to official sources, there are no troops stationed in southern Shanghai. The area is only nominally called a refugee area and has no organization, sovereignty, or anything else that belongs to us. Therefore, there is no question of when it will begin. According to a reporter from the China East News Agency, Mayor Yu, Father Jacquinot, and Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau discussed this matter again at the Municipal Government at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. The location and other details can be resolved without problems. It is reported that it has been decided that the area north of Fangbang Road, south of Minguo Road, west of Xiaodongmen, and east of Fangbang Bridge will be the refugee area, which is estimated to be one-third of the urban area.</p>
<p>The Guomin News Agency reports that after the movement of our military front lines, refugees have gathered in the western part of Shanghai. Rao Jiaju and Ma Ruishan, directors of the relief team of the Shanghai International Relief Society, specially invited Salvation Army Lieutenant Colonel Burkeley and Captain Du Baotian to rescue 12,000 refugees and bring them into the concession. Besides sending more than 4,000 refugees to the Haig Road shelter and 2,000 to shelters 123, rice and steamed buns are distributed in the morning and evening. The remaining approximately 6,000 refugees are at the Xiaoshadu Road Fourth Shelter. Because the shelter did not have time to build grass sheds, it will take approximately six days to complete them. During this period, Rao Jiaju lent two large tents as temporary shelters from the rain. In view of the recent increase in the number of refugees and the lack of remaining houses and vacant land in the concession area, Rao and Ma established the Nanshi safety zone. Its nature and scope have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is expected to be established soon.</p>

<p>Declaration Issued: The general assembly issued a declaration stating: "Japanese imperialists, in order to fulfill their dream of continental policy, have spared no effort to use all kinds of poisonous methods to continuously invade China. From the Xinhai Revolution to this day, the painful facts in history have made us unable to tolerate them any longer. However, our government has always endured humiliation and borne heavy burdens, adhering to its original intention of loving peace and exerting its greatest efforts to urge the Japanese enemy to finally realize their mistakes, in order to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. However, the Japanese bandits are like long snakes, endlessly demanding and oppressing, becoming increasingly extreme. Recently, after sweeping through Tianjin and Beiping, they have invaded Central China with heavy troops, committing crimes in Shanghai, destroying our cultural institutions, killing our innocent refugees, and committing all kinds of brutal and bestial acts. At this final moment for the survival and continuation of our nation, the national labor community, with deep patriotic feelings and an urgent desire to save the nation, besides individually launching resistance, is now taking a unified step, concentrating all forces, and specially initiating the organization of this association. Under a unified and strong solidarity, we will mobilize the national labor community, exert great collective strength, defend our territory, and uphold justice. We are willing to throw away our blood and heads, sacrifice everything, and resist to the end, in order to win the independent survival of the nation. If the national crisis is not resolved, this ambition will not change. We respectfully declare this, and we hope that you will appreciate and accept it."</p>
<h3>Civil Food Regulation Association Ends Today</h3>
<p>Wartime Food is of Utmost Importance. After the outbreak of war in this city, the Social Affairs Bureau immediately organized the Shanghai Civil Food Regulation Committee together with relevant agencies and trade associations in the food industry. Since its establishment, it has actively dredged transportation, stabilized rice prices, and set up rice sales points in various parts of the city to facilitate residents' purchases, sparing no effort and achieving remarkable results. The association believes that this year's new grains have had good harvests in various regions, and there is no fear of food shortages. The city has abundant rice reserves, which are sufficient to maintain them for a considerable period of time. How to provide assistance in the future depends on transportation. The situation changes at any time, and traders can find ways to deal with it. If there are really difficulties, they cannot be resolved by the association's strength. Therefore, the association recently convened a meeting of the standing committee and resolved that it would end its business and cease operations from today.</p>
<h3>Registration of Japanese Goods Ends Today</h3>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Committee for Economic Severance of Relations with Japan originally scheduled the registration of Japanese goods purchased by various shops and factories in the city to end at the end of last month. Subsequently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce forwarded a letter from various industry trade associations requesting an extension. The committee then announced that it would grant an extension of one week. Today is the last registration period and will not be extended again. It is reported that various industry factories and shops are registering enemy goods with great enthusiasm, sharing the same hatred and determination.</p>
<h3>Work of the Municipal Ambulance Committee Expanded</h3>
<p>Fundraising, Additional Directors Appointed; Sixth Training Class Graduated Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Ambulance Committee held a membership meeting at the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge at 4:00 PM yesterday. Yan Fuqing, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Binghui, Huang Renzhi, Zhou Bangjun, Lin Kecong, and more than 50 other people attended. Yan Fuqing first reported on the work situation in the past three months, followed by speeches by Lin Kanghou, Huang Renzhi, and others, stating that the committee's work has expanded, and the funding is bound to increase. It is hoped that various group members will raise more funds so that this cause can proceed smoothly to benefit the wounded soldiers. It is also learned that the committee has specially appointed Huang Renzhi and Lin Kanghou as directors in order to increase its strength due to the actual needs.</p>
<p>More Than 50 Graduating Students</p>
<p>The sixth ambulance training class of the Shanghai Municipal Ambulance Committee held a graduation ceremony at the Municipal He'an Elementary School on North Chengdu Road at 8:00 PM yesterday. Guests included Red Cross representative Secretary Gan, ambulance director Ye Dai, General Manager Wang Kui, the Jing-Hu-Hang Ambulance Team, Brigade Commander Chen Rongzhang, Training Director Liu Tulin, and more than ten representatives from various agencies. After the ceremony, Chairman Liu Shilin delivered an opening speech and reported on the progress. Then, the guests delivered speeches one after another, and the chairman gave a training speech, which stated: "Dear comrades, it has been three weeks since you joined this class for training. However, in these three weeks, many comrades have completely changed their past habits, actions, and will. Compared with when they first entered this class, it can be said that they are completely different. This is the point that makes me most gratified. However, there are still a few comrades who have not understood the meaning of ambulance, as if they have not been trained at all. They always feel that life is too dry, and the actions are completely mechanical, without any interest or vitality. They have received three weeks of training. But today is the day when you graduate. So, what will you do after graduation? Of course, it is to do our ambulance work, to rescue our compatriots, and to rescue our soldiers. Then, you must know that in this time of all-out war of resistance, our ambulance personnel have a very important responsibility. Those who are not hardworking, resilient, thrifty, honest, intelligent, and brave are not worthy of being ambulance personnel. Therefore, when you become ambulance personnel in the future, you must have the spirit of sacrificing for the country and the nation. When you set out for ambulance work, you must not be negligent or lazy, and you must conscientiously go to the designated location. No matter how dangerous it is, we must be determined to fulfill our duties and not be afraid of death. We must be brave and cautious, able to endure hardship, and then people in society will respect us. Even the soldiers on the front lines will know that we have a great spirit of fearlessness and will be more respectful of us, and it will increase their courage to kill the enemy. Therefore, ambulance personnel are in the most important position during the war period. Please do not take it as a child's play or as an unimportant thing, in order to win our victory." After the ceremony was completed at around 10:00 PM, a group photo was taken, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<p>Essay Competition for Service Personnel</p>
<p>In order to enable people from all walks of life to understand the real situation of ambulance work on the front lines, the Municipal Ambulance Committee has decided to hold an essay competition. The topic is "Experiences in Frontline Ambulance Work." All service personnel of the ambulance teams and first aid teams under the committee may participate. Each team should submit at least one essay to encourage collective writing, and attach photos or cartoons. The number of words should be between 1,000 and 3,000 as a general rule. The content of the manuscript must be specific and informative, and the writing must be lively and fluent. The deadline for submission is the 15th of this month. After the manuscripts have been collected and the rankings have been determined, the first three places will be given prizes by the committee, and the best ones will be sent to various newspapers for publication or printed and distributed by the committee itself. Since the 30th of last month, the committee has been asking all radio stations in the city to broadcast the committee's news free of charge every day.</p>
<p>The Red Swastika Society Provides Ambulance Services in the Rain</p>
<p>The relief team of the Red Swastika Society, in view of the fierce battles on the front lines, set out in full force at 7:00 PM the night before last, when it was raining heavily. The road was muddy, and the car almost overturned, but they bravely arrived at the ×× location and rescued a total of 53 wounded soldiers, who were sent to the various hospitals of the society. They have now returned to the team safely.</p>
<p>Recruiting 100 Stretcher Bearers</p>
<p>The Youth National Salvation Service Corps is entrusted by the ×× Division to recruit 100 stretcher bearers and 20 ambulance personnel. Non-members must have a guarantor. The registration location is the Youth National Salvation Service Corps in the Longshou Xiaoyuan, Fangxie Road, Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Security Corps Organizes Traffic Control Corps</h3>
<p>French Police Pay Attention to Bandits</p>
<p>Nanshi residents have recently been moving to the concession, which is quite crowded. The Chinese and French authorities have dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western police officers to do their best to maintain traffic. In recent days, the Shanghai South Security Corps has also organized a traffic control corps, dispatching a large number of male and female members to help the police officers direct pedestrians at various important intersections, telling them to keep left when going out and keep right when going in. As a result, the order has improved, and the general residents are gradually becoming calmer. Shops are operating as usual. However, the French police officers at the intersections are especially paying attention to bandits and unruly elements who are mixed in with the crowds. Anyone who looks even slightly suspicious, especially those wearing bronze caps or woolen hats, are strictly questioned or searched. If there are no illegal items, they are allowed to pass.</p>
<h3>Anti-Enemy Association Convenes Student Groups for Talks</h3>
<p>Work Hard in Battlefield Service; Concentrate Forces and Unify Actions</p>
<p>The organization committee of the Shanghai All Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association held a discussion meeting for representatives of youth student groups yesterday. Besides the vice chairman of the association, Yi Lirong, the director and deputy director of the guidance group, Chen Zhongfu and Xu Yongyi, and the director of the student section, Jin Dongri, the attendees included representatives from more than ten groups such as the China Youth National Salvation Service Corps, the Youth National Salvation Service Corps, the National Crisis Youth Service Corps, the Boy Scout Wartime Service Corps, the Student Circle National Salvation Association, and the College Student Friendship Association, totaling 21 people. The meeting was chaired by Vice Chairman Yi, who reported on the government's determination to resist to the end, the recent international situation, and the significance of maintaining unity and convening the discussion meeting. Then, the representatives expressed their opinions one after another, unanimously advocating actively working hard in battlefield service, arming and defending Shanghai, and that all youth student groups should concentrate their forces, unify their actions, and work conscientiously under the leadership of party and government agencies.</p>
<h3>A Certain Ever-Victorious Army Desperately Needs Supplies</h3>
<p>A certain division, which previously fought bravely against the enemy at Luodian for a long time, unwilling to rotate for rest, and repeatedly establishing extraordinary achievements, has recently been ordered to be transferred to defend a certain important new position. All the officers and soldiers believe that the opportunity to kill the enemy will be even greater and more heroic than before. Everyone is a hundred times more energetic and enthusiastically heads to the front lines. However, the division is in great need of military supplies, such as machine-powered bicycles, military trucks, automobiles, electric wires, telephones, burlap sacks, cotton overcoats, cloth shoes, knee boots, etc. It is earnestly hoped that compatriots from all walks of life will, mindful of the perilous and pressing situation, enthusiastically donate to benefit military needs.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Sustained Resistance and Organizing Peasant Militias</h3>
<p>— Huang Shiying</p>
<p>The sacred national all-out resistance has begun. Under the leadership of the supreme leader's resolute attitude, the nation has achieved a unity of will as strong as steel. All the people of the Republic of China deeply recognize that this war of resistance against the enemy is a critical moment for the survival of our nation. All have the firm belief and determination to obey the government and resist to the end. This determination is also the cornerstone of the Chinese nation's pursuit of liberation and rejuvenation.</p>
<p>At present, the brave soldiers are fighting bloody battles on the front lines, already inflicting fierce blows on the invaders. The people in the rear are sincerely supporting the front lines, concentrating national strength, and waging a sustained resistance. Patriotic people are all filled with fervor, rising up to plan for national salvation and survival. The day of justice being upheld is also the moment for us to fight bravely against the enemy. However, current popular organizations still lack appropriate practical institutions for resisting the enemy. We deeply feel that in order to enhance the military capabilities of resistance and achieve the goal of sustained victory, we must enhance the effectiveness of the military resistance. The enhancement of the effectiveness of the military resistance relies on arming the people, especially arming the peasants. This is the most effective approach. As our country is founded on agriculture, and peasants account for more than 80% of the population, organizing troops on this basis and implementing political education will mean that the entire nation becomes soldiers. The greatness of this force is unparalleled. Moreover, the peasants themselves make a living by farming, and their work will not be affected by organization. This strategy contains the meaning of soldiers being part-time farmers. Thus, even if the Japanese invaders have strong armor and sharp weapons, their resistance will face the pain of thorns at every step. Therefore, organizing peasant militias is an absolute necessity for actively expanding the resistance. This is why we have proposed the organization of peasant militias.</p>
<p>At present, although the peasants' knowledge is immature, their understanding of this national war of resistance is very vague, or even completely unclear. If this state of mental stagnation among the people is not rapidly addressed with training, seeking national liberation, sustained resistance, and victory will be like heading south to reach the north. In order to actively investigate this issue and implement it, I have personally investigated the psychology of peasants, which can be summarized into the following four categories:</p>
<p>The first category is those who are unaware of world affairs. These peasants are nothing more than law-abiding people. (Including rich peasants and owner-cultivators) Their mentality is that they are content to be able to cultivate, have a good harvest every year, and have enough to eat, regardless of which dynasty comes to power. If these peasants are stimulated by propaganda about the Japanese army occupying the land, burning and killing villages, raping women, and massacring children, they will inevitably be roused to deep anger and change their complacent mentality; they will be likely to actively resist Japan.</p>
<p>The second category is those who complain about heaven and blame earth. These are poor peasants and tenant farmers. Their daily lives are oppressed by poverty, and they are burdened with debts year after year, unable to repay them. Their hearts are filled with resentment. If they are stimulated by the fact that their poverty is caused by the Japanese looting and exploitation, and that if the Japanese pirates are not eliminated as soon as possible, they will inevitably suffer a tragic death, their own suffering will inevitably turn into anger towards the enemy. This will arouse them to kill the enemy in order to improve their lives in the future.</p>
<p>The third category is those who are timid and afraid of death. For these peasants, as long as the propaganda of the above two types of peasants is successful, friction and agitation will naturally increase their courage and forge them into one.</p>
<p>The fourth category is peasants who are fond of gossip. These peasants are already a cut above the rest in their anti-Japanese sentiment. However, although they have anti-enemy thoughts, they are hindered by distorted superstitions. For example, farmers in certain areas often believe rumors about the Great Emperor Guan Yu wearing a red robe and wielding a broadsword to kill the enemy. Although these peasants have high anti-enemy emotions, they lack leadership and go astray, engaging in unrealistic and blind actions such as burning incense and praying to heaven. If they are given earnest guidance, instilled with correct national thinking, and made aware of the great cause of national salvation, with propaganda such as protecting farmland and territory being the duty of peasants, and given military organization, their combat effectiveness will definitely be strong. The fire of justice will be like adding oil to a raging flame, and the greatness of its strength will make the Japanese pirates fear it. The future of national resistance will inevitably be firmly grasped by popular organizations.</p>
<p>In the past, during the Mexican Revolution, it was armed farmers who destroyed the shackles of despotic tyranny, ultimately overthrowing the royal family and creating peace. The strength of this force can be imagined. In the Northeast, our volunteer army has fought with the enemy for years, unyielding and unyielding, often exhausting the enemy and inflicting heavy losses, which is one example. In the Punan area of Jiangsu Province, there is no shortage of brave and skilled peasant and salt farmer fighters, but unfortunately the government has not yet paid attention to them. A certain division commander in Shanghai once told reporters that if public opinion is not organized in peacetime, one will suffer greatly in wartime. No wonder our troops do not see the masses wherever they go, only "traitors." The defenses and military equipment of our army are soon known to the enemy by traitors. Can these alarming facts not be given serious attention and regarded as a major hidden danger on the road to resistance? However, what is past is past, and what is to come can be pursued. It is not too late to mend the fold after losing the sheep. Therefore, we want the government to be willing to approve the reasonable requests of the people in good faith, send supervisors to guide, and quickly contact those who are ambitious, capable, and have the highest reputation among the peasants and the most frank attitude in various places to quickly launch and organize peasant militias. Training can begin in the rear of the near-war zone, and firearms can be issued to work together to crush the aggressor's plan to "conquer China" and protect the integrity of the motherland's territory and sovereignty.</p>
<p>Attached below is a general outline of the organization and implementation of the peasant militia for reference. The person leading and organizing the peasant militia must have a long-standing relationship with the peasants, have a high reputation, and be someone whom the local peasants are willing to follow. Initially, one can start with a small number of villages and gradually expand, which is easier to achieve.</p>
<p>When organizing the peasant militia initially, emphasis should be placed on propaganda, followed by training. In addition to teaching guerrilla tactics, attention must also be paid to political training, as Generalissimo Chiang said, "three parts military, seven parts political." In political training, the Three Principles of the People should be used as the basic course in daily lectures to engage in Party-based education, trust in the leader, and faith in the government. Peasants may be unfamiliar with these things at first, but they will definitely become interested in the future. And this kind of national defense propaganda during extraordinary times will make them excellent peasants in the future, which is beneficial to national defense and enhances the culture of the Chinese masses, combining the best of both worlds and achieving two goals with one action.</p>
<p>The combat training of the peasant militia should adopt the most sensitive guerrilla tactics. If the enemy approaches, the peasants will fight in groups of three or five in the fields to assist the army's positional warfare, using feint attacks in the east and strikes in the west, encircling battles with the whole dividing into parts, annihilation battles with parts integrating into the whole, surprise attacks with fewer defeating more, and reinforcement battles with the few resisting the many. Guerrilla instructors should be hired to train them. Given the vastness of our country and the size of the peasant population, once they are trained and organized, those who cross the fields, cultivate, and travel back and forth will all be plainclothes heroes protecting the territory. Not only will the strength of the resistance be enhanced, but also the foundation for the collectivization of peasant life will be built, sweeping away the selfish phenomenon of the past. Moreover, the peasants' main occupation is agriculture, producing rice and grain and feeding themselves, so their organization does not need to consume supplies like the army. In addition, the peasants are honest and simple in nature. After proper training, they will work as usual when there is nothing to do, and they will be able to bravely strive forward once they go to war. Their strength cannot be underestimated. In this all-out war of resistance, with the unity of the top and bottom, and with the armed peasants as the support, it is more than enough to save the country from danger. Conversely, with the current immaturity of peasant knowledge and their scattered state, they can easily be exploited by the enemy. Because the peasants are familiar with the local geography, if they are not organized, they will either die in the artillery fire, or they will be driven and guided, or they will provide food to support the enemy. Their disruption of the resistance formation will have a significant impact, which is worthy of attention. They will flee their homes to avoid artillery fire and become vagrant bandits, which will require the local authorities to resettle and provide relief, or they will take risks for a living and disrupt the peace in the rear. If they have been organized into militias, they can rise up and fight in the fields when the enemy approaches, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The harm and benefit to the future of the war of resistance will be inversely proportional, with a difference that cannot be measured in miles.</p>
<p>If the peasant militia encounters an enemy, repels the enemy army, or assists the army in repelling the enemy army, they will not pursue the enemy, but will continue to cultivate in the fields. This will not reduce their production work. When necessary, the peasant militia can send a portion to meet the needs of guarding nearby cities. The police force can be deployed in areas where the police force is weak, first to suppress traitors, stabilize the local area, and maintain order. Bandits and petty thieves can also be expected to be deterred. Moreover, they have a lot of contact with the local people, and their duties will inevitably be harmonious and thorough. In the event of an air raid or fire, the peasant militia can also take charge of rescue, burial, and firefighting work. As for their food and supplies, they can be distributed according to the output of each village landlord, without the harm of burdening the people and wasting money. Farm women are responsible for relief, protection of children, and transportation during wartime. Unexpected expenses and future pensions for the war can be collected from the landlords' rent. Organizing armed peasants may not necessarily be of interest to the peasants at first. One can start with a small portion, asking the military authorities to issue a small number of guns first and establish a small team. Peasants are always interested in firearms and gradually expand their participation. If we can work hard to promote the great cause of national salvation, supporters will inevitably spring up like clouds. Internally, the organization will be based on villages, forming militia squads. A squad leader will be established. Several nearby villages will form a militia company. Three companies will form a militia battalion. Counties and districts will form a general battalion. The general battalion will be divided into military, political, secretarial, intelligence, rescue, and general affairs cadres.</p>
<p>The blood bell has rung. The sacred national liberation movement has launched the fiercest blood battle. We are determined to resist to the end with a scorched-earth resistance. At this time of national peril, saving the country cannot be achieved by empty words. We must engage in effective practical battles to achieve the goal of victory. Therefore, organizing peasant militias is a pressing and essential move.</p>
<p>Therefore, we sincerely request the government and military authorities to give deep consideration to this. We are willing to launch and organize under the leadership of the government and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, creating a unified front between the military and the people, sacrificing for the country, and working hard to resist to the end.</p>

<p>Shaoxing Fellow Townsmen Association: The Shanghai Fellow Townsmen Association of the seven counties of Shaoxing, in view of the invasion by brutal enemies and the increasing national crisis, believes that in order to resist insult and save the nation, in addition to the loyal and brave resistance of the soldiers on the front lines, the people in the rear should also do their best to prepare for national use. Donating money is saving the country, and saving the country is saving oneself. There are no fewer than hundreds of thousands of people from Shaoxing counties in Shanghai. If everyone can be mobilized and work hard in the bond fundraising movement, there will be considerable results. The Association has scheduled a meeting at 3:00 PM today on the third floor of the China United Trust Company on Beijing Road to gather all the fellow townsmen in Shanghai to discuss and promote bond fundraising methods to repay the country and strengthen long-term resistance.</p>
<h3>The Nature of the Money Industry Clearing House is Permanent</h3>
<p>The Pilot Period Has Achieved Considerable Success; All Member Firms Have Joined</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Money Industry Association convened quarterly management meetings to study business reforms, it gradually abolished all old practices and implemented new accounting and public list systems modeled after banking methods, canceling monthly discount interest, etc. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the pilot operation of the clearing house has achieved considerable success. It has now been decided that it will become a permanent entity. The clearing time is temporarily set from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM daily. All 46 members are clearing money houses. The method is the same as the bank clearing house.</p>
<h3>Pastor LoCock Describes the Air Defense of the Capital</h3>
<p>Insufficient Military Doctors, Wounded Soldiers Without Complaint; Realistic and Not Illusory</p>
<p>The Continental Times reports that Pastor LoCock of this port has returned from visiting Beijing. According to the Continental Times reporter, what he saw on this trip was very touching. However, after inspecting several hospitals and talking with the doctors in the hospitals, he felt that there was a major shortcoming, namely, that there were still not enough military doctors. Now there is a need for mobile medical teams, but they cannot be handled by allowing people to donate as they please like the Red Cross. The lack of rear doctors is unbelievable. Wounded soldiers have to walk several miles to reach the initial first aid station, and sometimes they are treated after three or four days, but none of them complain. Most of them want to return to the front line as soon as possible to kill the enemy. He traveled back and forth by car, and he did not encounter any danger, which was unexpected. It took a day and night to travel from Shanghai to Beijing, and only one full day to return from Beijing to Shanghai. While staying in Beijing, he experienced many air raids, but the order in Beijing was orderly and admirable. The thoroughness of its response to air raids would be praised even by Berlin, London, and New York. When enemy planes arrive, the whole city is not disturbed at all, as if it were a lifeboat drill. As soon as the first alarm is given, soldiers take trucks and drive to the points where they should be stationed. At this time, the second alarm continues, informing you that you must not walk on the road. When the third emergency alarm is issued, the planes are already overhead. Those with shelters should hide inside. Many shelters cannot avoid bombs, but only shells and bomb fragments. After the planes leave, the alarm is sounded to lift the alert. The officials in Beijing are all realistic and do not make illusions about what can be achieved. What is even more surprising is that their calmness in the face of the Japanese invasion is greater than the Allies' calmness in responding to the world war. They strongly criticize the Japanese army for doing whatever it wants. Everyone's love for the country is no different from the soldiers on the front lines. He deeply admires the decisiveness and talent of the leaders in Beijing. Although there are many places in the city where huge holes have been formed due to being hit by bombs, the damage caused by the bombs is rare. The city is still doing business as usual, and trams and buses are still running, but the roads are not as lively as they used to be, because many residents have dispersed outside Beijing.</p>
<h3>The Songjiang Red Cross Branch Establishes Hospitals and Bandaging Stations</h3>
<p>After Songjiang was repeatedly bombed indiscriminately by Japanese planes in recent days, the buildings and equipment of various hospitals were bombed and destroyed, so the treatment of wounded soldiers and civilians was very difficult. In addition to establishing a rescue hospital by the Songjiang Red Cross, it plans to establish a wounded soldiers' bandaging station, and has been strongly supported by Mr. Peig Meng, an American missionary from the Shanghai Supervisory Association, and Mr. Xie Songsan, who have raised a large number of medicines, which are being rushed to transport. At the same time, Mr. Wang Peiyuan of the Shanghai General Association has been asked to send a doctor to assist in everything, in order to establish it as soon as possible and engage in treatment. In order to facilitate the departure of ambulances and boats along the way, Zhou Xuewen, the chairman of the Association, sent a telegram to the Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Border Region, requesting him to check the established case and order his subordinates to allow them to pass. The East Telegraph has been received, approving the dispatch of telegrams to various troops, requesting them to be properly protected.</p>
<h3>The Jianghai Customs Superintendency is Abolished</h3>
<p>Due to the strict implementation of austerity, the Ministry of Finance has issued an order to abolish all customs superintendencies nationwide. Only the position of superintendent is retained, and the superintendent will work in the tax affairs office.

<p>New Voice News reports that the Citizens' Federation of the First Special District of this city yesterday notified the district branches, "The Shanghai Citizens' Committee for National Economic Severance with Japan sent a letter stating, 'After reviewing the resolutions of the first executive committee meeting of this committee, we request that the various groups in this city inform their members not to work for enemy industrial and commercial institutions or families, not to use enemy warehouses, not to take enemy ships, and not to use enemy currency or have any economic relationship with enemy banks, etc.' These have been recorded. Correspondingly, we record this case and request that you review it and inform your members to comply." After reviewing the case, we find that the thorough implementation of economic severance with Japan is the most important step in supporting long-term resistance and打击the enemy. We hope that your association will inform the citizens in the district to implement all the points indicated by the Severance Committee.</p>
<h3>The Unemployed Workers Relief Association Introduces Skilled Workers</h3>
<p>If Various Industries Feel a Need, They Can Contact the Association</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Unemployed Workers Relief Committee registered adult male workers, it has established two shelters to accommodate unemployed workers. Supplementary fees have been issued to the qualified registered workers, and the skilled workers who have been accommodated have completed their exams and have been divided into four categories: mechanical, chemical, civil engineering, and electrical.

<h3>New War Zone Map Published by the Zhonghua Book Company</h3>
<p>The Traces of the Enemy and Us Fighting Can Be Seen at a Glance</p>
<p>Since our country launched a full-scale war of resistance, the war zone has become wider due to the rampant abuse of power by the brutal Japanese, and the maps printed in peacetime by the Zhonghua Book Company are not enough to meet the needs of wartime. The Zhonghua Book Company has specially printed five kinds of war zone maps, detailing the rivers, mountains, traffic lines, and small place names such as villages and houses in each area, with accuracy and detail. All schools, public education institutions, or individuals should purchase a copy and hang it on the wall. When reading news reports about the war, refer to the detailed place names listed on this map, and the traces of the enemy and us fighting can be seen at a glance, as if you are on the battlefield. It is a necessary tool for instilling wartime geographical knowledge. The Songhu area map and the Rehe Chahar Suiyuan combined map have been released, each selling for 2 jiao. The Jiangnan Zhejiang coastal map, the Hebei Province map, and the Shanxi Province map each sell for jiao. They are all printed in color and are specially priced cheaply in order to achieve widespread sales.</p>
<p>Special Commentary</p>
<p>— Zhang Zhirang</p>
<h3>The Soviet Revolution and China's War of Resistance by Zhang Zhirang</h3>
<p>Today is the 20th anniversary of the Soviet October Revolution. As we are in the midst of our War of Resistance against Japan, it should feel particularly heartwarming to celebrate the national day of this friendly nation.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union, during and after the October Revolution, advanced towards two goals: first, liberation, and second, peace. Liberation was the people's quest for liberation from the oppression of the Tsar and the classes he represented. Peace was the effort to strive for world peace by starting with peace between their country and the various imperialists. The method it adopted was struggle—armed struggle. China is now seeking liberation for the entire nation from the oppression of Japanese imperialism, and is also striving for world peace by starting with our own peace with the Japanese people. The method we use is resistance—also armed struggle.</p>
<p>In the process of the Soviet Union striving for its own external peace and world peace, there are many points that are closely related to our country's War of Resistance against Japan. This is what should be particularly noted when commemorating the national day of our friendly nation today.</p>
<p>At the beginning of its founding, the Soviet Union inherited a war from the Tsar. This war was a war of mutual aggression among imperialists and was fundamentally unconscious. Therefore, it ended it with swift and decisive measures, and at the same time, used the armed force of the entire people to liberate the internal unrest that was supported by various imperialists at the time. As a result, the traitors were eliminated, and foreign troops completely left the country. This is an example of opposing wars of mutual aggression and resisting foreign aggression.</p>
<p>After participating in the disarmament conference, the Soviet Union proposed a definition of "aggressor." This definition was adopted by the Security Committee of the Disarmament Conference in 1933, and in the same year, Finland, Poland, Romania and other countries used it as a basis to conclude a convention with the Soviet Union. The point we want to raise in this definition is that anyone who invades the territory of another country by force, whether or not a declaration of war has been made, should be considered an aggressor. This is the way Japan invaded China and Italy invaded Abyssinia. Its simplicity and clarity is enough to leave aggressors with no room for sophistry. This is an implicit help given to them.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union also put forward a doctrine on the nature of peace in theory by its Foreign Commissar Litvinov—that peace is indivisible. Imperialists have always regarded wars of aggression, such as the previous Sino-Japanese War and the Italo-Ethiopian War, as matters solely between the two countries, unrelated to world peace. As a result, seeds of disruption to world peace have been repeatedly sown. The Nine-Power Treaty Conference is now being held for this kind of war, and we should make every effort to make the countries participating in the conference aware of the truth of this doctrine.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the indivisibility of peace naturally leads to two conclusions when applied in practice. The first is that the so-called "regionalization of war" is an extremely dangerous proposition; its result is to condone aggression. The second is that collective security in various regions should be actively promoted. Now that our country is strongly advocating sanctions against Japan by various countries and the establishment of a collective security system in the Pacific, the application of this doctrine should be given particular importance.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's efforts for world peace also have a direct relationship with our country in the midst of the War of Resistance. Not long after the start of the battle in Shanghai, a non-aggression treaty was concluded with our country. On September 21, Litvinov strongly criticized the aggressor countries at the League of Nations General Assembly, advocating that a collective resistance method should be used to deal with them: on September 27, he expressed full support for the British proposal to condemn the Japanese air force's bombing behavior in the Advisory Committee. On October 5, he declared at the League of Nations General Assembly: The Advisory Committee recognized the fact of Japanese aggression against China, did not use the word "aggression," and did not propose material assistance to China, which was regrettable. On the 4th of this month, he warned the countries at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference not to allow international conferences to become tools of aggressors, and advocated taking practical measures to protect or restore peace. These are all actions that directly help our country and strive for world peace.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has already taken the above actions in order to strive for world peace. During this international conference, we especially hope that it can further negotiate with Britain, the United States, France, and other countries to agree on joint sanctions against aggression. During this period of being invaded, our country should especially express to the outside world. With the determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats, and to resist to the end, strengthen the peace front to deal with the aggressors in the world!</p>

<h3>A Record of Returning from Participating in the Army-Civilian Joint Celebration</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qirui</p>
<p>After the "People's Daily" published the news of a certain county's army-civilian War of Resistance celebration, the township office solicited opinions from the people; "How to participate in this great event?" After much discussion, it was decided to present two victory flags to the commander and all the officers and soldiers of the ×× army; due to the limited time to participate in the entertainment program, there was not enough preparation, so it had to be left for the next opportunity.</p>
<p>The embroidery work of the two flags was assigned to Zhang Yinxian, Zhang Qiwei, Hu Xiangqin, and myself. The four girls were carefully embroidering stitch by stitch in front of the shed. The rumbling sound of cannons came from afar, and the planes circled overhead from time to time. Our blood was boiling, our hearts were too excited, we silently wished for the victory of the soldiers in front, we silently wished for the safety of the soldiers in front; Chinese women embroidering victory flags for the soldiers defending the motherland is for the survival of the nation, for freedom and light; it is not like Japanese women sewing a "thousand-person garment" for the warlords who invaded neighboring countries, promoting the arrogance of the warlords, and destroying humanity and justice in the world!</p>
<p>The date of the meeting arrived, and two small boats carrying more than twenty people set off for ×× Town. On the boat, we taught two children the etiquette of presenting flower baskets. Although they were young, they were very sensible. At the age of five, they already knew how to support our leader and defeat our enemies. They pointed at the sky with fake pistols made of cigarette boxes from time to time and said: "Kill the Japanese!" The little hand saluted and said: "Salute the commander-in-chief! We must save China!" We must pay special attention to the initial education of children, and instill the seeds of saving the country in their young minds. The restoration of Turkey is a good example for us!</p>
<p>Arriving at the destination, it was already 11:30. Our ranks took a photo in front of the main entrance of the public square, and then reported to the conference.</p>
<p>On the front of the auditorium, hung a very large book. This is a work of the battlefield service group. Above are the images of the enemy brutally killing our compatriots. When we read this book, we should be like eating ice in winter, every piece in our hearts, firmly remember the cruelty of the enemy, and hold on to the determination to resist the enemy. All around were closely posted awakening slogans. Many people were already seated in the auditorium. It was really lively today. Clearly, there are no obstacles between the army and the people. Our army and the people joined hands and stood on the same front to resist our enemies.</p>
<p>The meeting started at 1:30. First, the chairman, the county magistrate, delivered a speech. His sincere attitude and passionate remarks attracted the audience's attention. Bursts of applause broke through the air of the whole field. Then Commander × gave instructions.</p>
<p>Apart from the newspapers, I have seen the portrait of Commander ×, but I have never seen the face of Commander ×, or heard the instructions of Commander ×. Today, this dream has come true. We are really fortunate to meet the anti-Japanese hero on the front line of national defense!</p>
<p>After Commander ×, Mr. Guo Moruo and Mr. Tian Han gave speeches. Mr. Guo lived in Japan for ten years. In today's severe national crisis, he finally threw himself into the embrace of the motherland and struggled for national survival. He said: "Commander × is a famous iron army, Commander × is now defending ××, and the people of ×× under the leadership of Commander x should be an iron people." Yes! We should all be iron people, and we should quickly train to become real iron people who resist the enemy. In my previous imagination, Mr. Tian Han was a lively, strong, and very well-dressed middle-aged man, but today, seeing him with my own eyes, my imagination was completely wrong. Mr. Tian Han was not lively and strong, but very calm, wearing a half-new Zhongshan suit with no decorations. His attitude was calm and his tone was calm. Every word touched people's hearts, as beautiful as poetry, and as majestic as a song, making us cry and laugh.</p>
<p>After the speech, it was our turn to present flowers and flags. Our representatives, Miss Zhang and others, were led by × Executive of the County Party Department to the stage. Amidst the applause, Commander × received the salute, flowers, and flags with a smile, and then the entertainment program began.</p>
<p>Today's program is very precious. It is a groundbreaking medley in ××, combining drama, singing, and dancing in one, inspiring national consciousness, publicizing the enemy's brutality, and making every audience member cry and roar with excitement!</p>
<p>On the way back, the twilight was vast. Looking into the northeast, the fire was soaring into the sky, silently reciting "Wait until I have cleaned up the old mountains and rivers, and face the imperial court!" I felt a burst of heroic sadness in my heart, and I almost shed tears. (Paid)</p>

<h3>Shanghai Silk Factories Rely on Promoting Reeling</h3>
<p>Autumn cocoons are stagnant and no one buys them. Lack of silkworm moths affects reeling. All Zhejiang cocoon merchants schedule a meeting.</p>
<p>Due to the war and other various reasons, few silk factories in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have started work so far. Now, we are recording the actual situation in various aspects on the left.</p>
<p>Status of Working Silk Factories</p>
<p>Although there are now three silk factories in Shanghai that have started work, namely Jardine Matheson, Hongfeng, and Tongyu, one is a foreign company and the other is reeling on behalf of others, so whether they start work or not does not greatly benefit the entire silk cocoon industry. And although the three companies have a total of more than 1,100 silk reeling machines, not all of them have been put into operation. The number of operating machines is probably less than half.</p>
<p>The Key to Waiting and Seeing</p>
<p>It is found that what the three companies are reeling are still spring cocoons. As for autumn cocoons, Shanghai silk factories have not yet purchased them. Therefore, although there are still many silk factories in the Shanghai Special Zone, which is a safe area, none of them have started work. The reasons for this are roughly the following: ㊀ Silk sales have been sluggish since the outbreak of the war. ㊁ There is no supply of silkworm moths. ㊂ At the current cocoon price, there is no profit to be made after the silk is made.</p>
<p>Overview of the Silkworm Moth Problem</p>
<p>The above three reasons, except for the second, are easy to understand. The third reason is difficult for those who are not in charge of the industry to understand. When peeling the cocoons, silkworm moths must be used to gnaw and peel off the remaining parts that are attached to the cocoons in order to peel them clean. Therefore, silkworm moths are indispensable auxiliary products for silk reeling. The seeds of silkworm moths were previously supplied by silk factories, but now Shanghai Chinese silk factories, such as Xinfu Factory, have all stopped work.</p>
<p>Bird's-eye View of Shanghai Silk Factories</p>
<p>It is found that there were more than 100 silk factories in Shanghai during its heyday, but they have declined in recent years. Even in the spring of this year, only more than 30 silk factories started reeling. Now, most of the silk factories have fallen into the war zone, and there are only a little more than ten in the safe area. However, this year's autumn cocoons have shown a stagnant phenomenon. The above silk factories also need assistance from all parties to promote their start of work and reeling.</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Cocoon Merchants in Zhejiang</p>
<p>As for the silk factories in Zhejiang Province, there are a total of more than 30 companies. Except for the eight companies located in the railway areas of Xiashi, Chang'an, and Jiaxing, which cannot start work, the rest are located in inland towns. The local authorities are now trying to promote their early start of work. At the same time, all cocoon merchants in Zhejiang Province have also scheduled a meeting at the Jiaojia Gan Cocoon Association in Hangzhou on the 11th of this month to discuss ways to adjust silk cocoons. Miao Zhongxiu of the International Trade Bureau and Chu Huiseng, a leader in the silk lotus root industry, will also attend the meeting in Hangzhou at that time.</p>
<h3>Yong'an and Other Factories Need Factory Workers</h3>
<p>Recruiting spinning and weaving workers introduced by the Municipal West United Benefit Association</p>
<p>The Municipal West United Benefit Association of this city, in view of the fact that most of the factories in Shanghai have been affected by the war and have successively suspended work, and the number of unemployed people is very large, which will cause great damage to the country and individuals if this continues, has specially organized the registration of unemployed workers for introduction. Since the start of the business, many people have registered with the association every day to apply for introduction to work, and the association has tried to introduce them. It is now learned that Yong'an Yarn Factory, Anle Textile Factory, Hongzhang Yarn Factory, etc. in this city have requested the association to introduce hundreds of spinning and weaving workers. Those who have considerable experience in the above work can register at Chengdu Fang, Gordon Road before 9:00 am every day for introduction.</p>
<h3>The Workers' Salvation Association of Yarn Factories Universally Provides Relief</h3>
<p>Unemployed workers can register</p>
<p>The Workers' Salvation Association of Yarn Factories in this city has specially handled registration procedures to solve the livelihoods of the unemployed. The number of people who have gone to register in recent days has been very enthusiastic. In order to provide universal relief, in addition to sending those who have been registered and approved to work in the inland, all unemployed workers and unemployed people from various factories can go to register for relief. The address is Fuyu Village No. 24, next to the Huxi New Stage at the intersection of Laobaisheng Road and Jiaozhou Road.</p>

<h3>Wartime Construction University Has Already Started Classes</h3>
<p>President Yang Gives a Speech</p>
<p>The Shanghai Wartime Construction University, after active preparations by school directors Chen Lifu and others, has started classes this week. President Yang Hu made the following remarks: Since the supreme leader led the whole country and launched a full-scale War of Resistance, the enemy has wantonly destroyed our country's cultural and educational institutions and blocked our path to knowledge, which is the most barbaric and cruel act in the world. If the enemy destroys it and we cannot rebuild it, then how will we view ourselves? This is the reason for the establishment of the Wartime Construction University. I followed Mr. Chen Lifu and other advanced figures in the cultural world to engage in preparations, first established the board of directors, and was elected by the board of directors as president. I am a soldier, and I have made few contributions to cultural work. However, I believe that cultural and educational institutions are the foundation of the national spirit. Even if the enemy uses airplanes and cannons to bomb our cultural and educational institutions, we must at any time and anywhere clean up the ashes of the bombing and rebuild our cultural and educational cause from the scorched earth. Then it will be enough to show that our culture has a foundation that cannot be destroyed by airplanes and cannons, and can maintain its constant prosperity and growth even under the constant destruction of airplanes and cannons. Therefore, I reluctantly accepted the position of president. In the future, I will dedicate myself to the arduous work of culture with the spirit of a soldier defending the country, and seek to rebuild the cause of culture and education from the scorched earth of Songhu. Fortunately, the professors of our school are all well-known figures in the domestic cultural world and have a passion for education. They will be able to work together in the construction of wartime culture based on the spirit of revolutionary hard work.</p>
<h3>Condolence Message</h3>
<p>Christian Church Donates Winter Clothing</p>
<p>As the weather has turned cold in recent days, the Shanghai Christian Association, in order to meet the urgent needs of the wounded soldiers, yesterday sent 150 sets of short shirts and trousers for the lining and large bags of white sugar and lotus root flour to Zhu Hengbi, the president of the 23rd Wounded Soldiers Hospital on Hankou Road, and asked him to distribute them to the wounded soldiers for their enjoyment, to show their condolences.</p>
<p>Female Students from Various Schools Knit Shoes and Socks</p>
<p>The Chinese Women's Condolence Association for Soldiers and Self-Defense War of Resistance, because of the brutal invasion of Japan, the soldiers on the front line are loyal and brave in defending the country and fighting bloody battles, which has been two months. It is now deep autumn, and winter will be here in an instant. Winter supplies in the military are urgently needed to be prepared and supplied by people in the rear. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau a few days ago, asking it to send letters to various girls' schools to encourage female students to knit woolen socks, cotton shoes, and other winter supplies. It is now learned that the Social Affairs Bureau has recently issued instructions to the students of Minli, China Kunfan, and Daozhong Girls' Schools to knit them as soon as possible for transportation to the front.</p>
<h3>The Donation Coordination Association is Raising Emergency Kits</h3>
<p>Ten Thousand Packages</p>

He specially invited directors Rong Xianlin and director Rong's wife, Xu Yide, and more than ten other people last night to discuss fundraising methods. It is reported that the first batch of fundraising is designated as 10,000 packages.</p>
<h3>The 20th Round of Drawings for the Central Savings Society</h3>

There are 26 first, third, and fourth prizes of each kind. The lottery prizes are generous and easy to win. Therefore, recently, people from all walks of life have gone to the General Assembly to save money, which is very enthusiastic. The society has been ordered to take over and reorganize the special prize-winning savings of the China Industrial Bank. Since last month, it has started handling receipt exchanges. All savings certificates or mortgage deeds of the special prize-winning savings of the China Industrial Bank can be exchanged for reorganization receipts at the society. The procedures are very simple. Once the receipts are exchanged, they can enjoy all the generous benefits stipulated in the society's articles of association, which are the same as the original savers of the society. They are included in the drawings on a regular basis, and there is hope of winning prizes every month. It is reported that many of the households of the special prize-winning savings of the China Industrial Bank who exchanged receipts before the 19th round of drawings on October 15 won the first, third, and fourth prizes in the regular period. The savers who have not exchanged receipts, in view of the fact that exchanging receipts one round earlier means one more chance to win a prize, have flocked to No. 1 Tianjin Road, the society, to exchange receipts.</p>
<h3>Five Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police arrested five robbers, Pei Chengbiao, Chen Fuzhen, Wang Songlin, Li Afu, and Li Xiaowuzi, at a restaurant on Xinza Road No. 754, Yinghua Lane on Laobaisheng Road, and a thatched shed on Singapore Road yesterday.

<h3>Dachang Silk and Satin Store Moves to a New Location</h3>
<p>The Dachang Silk and Satin Store in Xiaodongmen of this port has temporarily moved to the east end of Lvbano Road, Xiafei Road in the French Concession for the convenience of customers.

<h3>School Enrollment Compilation</h3>
<p>Professor of the Music Department of Tianjin Women's Normal College │ Shan Delao Liang Xian and others recently returned from Tianjin to the town and cooperated with Chen Youxin, a violin professor of this city and a graduate of the National Conservatory of Music, to establish the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, with the purpose of teaching first music theory and art and training music teachers. It is reported that preparations have been completed, dividing into subjects such as theory, piano, vocal music, violin, and cello.

It is reported that classes are scheduled to officially start on the 15th of this month.</p>
<p>The United Association of Elementary School Teachers and Staff of this city has specially established 20 wartime elementary schools for the purpose of relieving the studies of children who have lost their schooling in the war zone, which have been opened one after another. Among them, the 9th school attached to Weigong Elementary School on Chengdu Road is particularly popular because of its moderate location and serious teaching. The children who go to school are unusually crowded. Zhang Lingfei, a buried event of the association, visited the school yesterday and thought it was satisfactory and praised it. According to the school, the existing school buildings are no longer sufficient to accommodate the students. With the consent of the parents, the principal, Li Guixi, will teach four classes in a classroom every day from 7:00 am to 7:00 pm from November. However, because there are not many places, those who are interested in studying should register with the school as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Tongchang Donates Seasonal Medicines</h3>
<p>Duolun Dan... Throat Pain Powder</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai War, corpses have been lying everywhere, and epidemics are unavoidable. Especially the victims are undernourished and more susceptible to illness. It is now reported that Tongchang Shenxing on Yunnan Road in this port, in view of this, has specially made a kind of rescue epidemic Chiting Duoming Dan, which specializes in treating seasonal epidemics and measles, and a kind of throat pain powder, which specializes in treating various throat diseases, which are extremely effective. Anyone with the above-mentioned ailments can call 90152 or notify the line in person, and they will send someone by bicycle to deliver it. However, because the medicine is precious and the ingredients are limited, preventive medicines are not given away in general. A prescription is attached to the medicine. If you are willing to repair and distribute the medicine according to the prescription, it will be an immeasurable merit.</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Risky Strategy</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>These past few days. The northern war reports have come. Although there are no deeply regrettable events. But the Shanghai front line of our army is unusually stable. The enemy forces are on the banks of the Suzhou River. Encountering strong resistance day after day. The losses and sacrifices suffered. Very significant. Even if they can occupy an inch of land south of the Suzhou River. The price paid is also not small.</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy, at great risk. Invaded the coastal defense of Zhejiang and Jiangsu borders. It is clear that this is to break the deadlock in the Shanghai war. Although the enemy forces that landed have been blocked and mostly annihilated by our army. But there are still many who are scurrying north. This poses a considerable threat to the rear of our army. We hope that our military authorities will use the most agile means. Eliminate them. Don't let the enemy's cunning tricks succeed.</p>
<p>At the same time. We think of the organization and training of the coastal people from this landing of the enemy. It is even more necessary to pay attention to this. Because China's coastline is very long. It is impossible to deploy heavy troops everywhere. Relying on the self-defense power of the people. It is difficult to prevent the enemy from taking advantage of the gaps and invading. Jinshanwei and other places are not easy places to land. If the local fishermen and salt workers have a strict organization early on. One party will eliminate the activities of traitors. One party will cooperate with the work of espionage. Then the enemy would never have the possibility of landing.</p>

<h3>Enemy Troops Land at Jinshanwei and Invade; Our Forces Have Been Mobilized to Block Them</h3>
<p>Our Forces Still Hold Absolute Advantage on the South Bank of the Suzhou River; We Launched Two Attacks at Xiaonanxiang, Inflicting Over a Hundred Casualties on the Enemy</p>
<p>This newspaper received a frontline report this year stating that the enemy army, facing our solid and strongly defended front lines in the Shanghai-Songhu battle, found it difficult to advance directly. Therefore, they recently dispatched joint naval and land forces to land at Jinshanwei in Hangzhou Bay, intending to outflank our Shanghai-Songhu army. According to military intelligence, the enemy forces that landed there have been continuously reinforced. This morning, they advanced from Zhalin, Songyin, and Mishidu in multiple directions towards the Songjiang, Minhang, and Fengxian lines. Our side immediately mobilized large forces from nearby to block them. It is not difficult to turn the Shanghai-Songhu battle from danger to safety. At the same time, it is also learned that the enemy seems to have the intention of landing at Lannidu. However, our forces there are strong, and if the enemy lands, they will be severely attacked. As for the battle on the south bank of the Suzhou River, our side still holds the advantage. The enemy forces, confined to the Yaojiazhai, Wujiaku, and Zhangzhai areas, number about two to three thousand. From last night until this morning, they continuously launched fierce attacks on the Zhujiabang, Chenjialong, and Tianduzhai lines, but were all bravely repelled by our army. Currently, our army is still encircling them from the original positions in the east, south, and west. The enemy at Liujiazhai launched repeated attacks in several detachments towards the Beiyijiazhai and Chenggeng positions to the southwest, attempting to break through. Beiyijiazhai was once lost in the evening but was quickly recovered after our army counterattacked. At the same time, a part of the Chenggeng position was also broken through by the enemy. Fortunately, the number of enemy was small. After our army surrounded and suppressed them, they were finally repelled before dawn this morning, and dozens of enemy soldiers were killed. As of noon today, the situation there, after a night of fierce fighting, is no longer as tense as last night. Also, the enemy east and west of Xiaonanxiang launched several attacks on our positions last night, but all were fiercely repelled by our army and retreated in defeat. The line from Guangfu to Shixianggong Temple is quiet and uneventful.</p>
<h3>Enemy at Mishidu Retreats South</h3>

<h3>Our Elite Troops Meet the Enemy; Situation on the South Bank Has Turned</h3>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at 12:45 PM on the 7th stated that our elite troops are fighting the enemy on the Yaojiazhai-Wujiaku line in the western section of the Suzhou River, and the situation has turned. Although the enemy has continuously attacked our key points at Zhujiabang, Xupu, and Quanjian in the past twelve hours, they have all been repelled by us. Baziqiao is our main stronghold, and the enemy launched a full-scale fierce attack on it. Although our position was once shaken last night, we eventually repelled the enemy after reinforcements and counterattacks. Zhangjiangdu, which controls the intersection of Zhujiabang and the Suzhou River, is also very important. We originally defended north of the Bang, but retreated to the south of the Bang due to enemy threats, and held our ground across the Zhujiabang from the enemy. The enemy, having failed in repeated attacks, used twenty-millimeter field guns to bombard Quanjian fiercely this morning. The sound of artillery shook the surrounding area and had not stopped as of the time of the report, with nearly a thousand shells fired.</p>

<h3>We Recovered Original Positions on the Chichuan Line</h3>
<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at 12:45 PM on the 7th stated that the enemy forces on the Liujiazhai side of the south bank of the Suzhou River launched fierce attacks on our Xuejiaku-Chichuan line. They were once broken through by the enemy last night, but our army counterattacked, and by dawn today, we had repelled the enemy and restored our original positions. Currently, our army is guarding the line from Xuejiaku to Chenggeng along Xiaobang.</p>
<h3>Our Army Launched Two Attacks at Zhuyuan</h3>

<p>A report from the Central News Agency's war correspondent at 12:00 PM on the 7th stated that our army, defending the Zhuyuan point southeast of Xiaonanxiang, has been facing the enemy entrenched at Wutong Temple for three days. Our army took the initiative to launch an attack last night, with the vanguard striking directly at Wutong Temple, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy.

According to reliable sources, a large number of enemy troops escorted military supplies from Hongkou to the western part of Shanghai this morning around 6:00 AM. At the same time, twelve trucks of supplies were also transported out around 8:00 AM. It is said that the military supplies were just transported from the enemy ships at the Qiujiang Wharf and the Huangpu Wharf yesterday and are now being transported to the front lines for use, which shows the scale of the daily consumption of the enemy army on the front lines.</p>

<h3>Post Office Discovers Glued Stamps</h3>
<p>Can Be Reused After Washing; Investigation and Handling Have Been Strictly Carried Out After Discovery</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration discovered a forged postage stamp with a triangular number in 1932 and punished the person who used it according to law. Recently, the bureau discovered another incident of gluing stamps in an attempt to reuse them after washing, which can be said to be a rare coincidence. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Discovery of Glued Stamps</p>
<p>The glued stamps discovered by the Shanghai Post Office this time were in the Large Parcel Group, so the value was quite considerable. The parcel sender glued the stamps so that even if they had been stamped with a postmark, they could still be peeled off. After washing, the postmark would come off with the glue, restoring the stamp to its original appearance, so that it could be reused. The plan was very cunning.</p>
<p>The Postmaster Ordered Attention</p>
<p>However, postal workers are experienced and have sharp eyes, so it was not easy to escape their notice. They were discovered and reported to Postmaster Zha Peilin. Zha believed that this kind of behavior would have a great impact on postal revenue. Therefore, in addition to strictly investigating and handling the relevant personnel involved in the sending and receiving of the parcels according to law, he also instructed the postal personnel under his jurisdiction to pay close attention when stamping stamps to prevent confusion and affecting the postal economy.</p>
<h3>American Ship "Chaumont" Brings American Mail</h3>

Also, the Shengjing ship sailed from Shanghai to Tianjin on the 6th. The ship also carried mail from Shanghai to Europe via the Siberian Railway.</p>
<h3>Textbook Prices Increased Starting Today</h3>
<p>Increased by 30% Based on the List Price</p>
<p>The City Book Industry Association stated that since March of this year, the prices of paper and other materials for printing books have gradually increased. Various businesses have tried hard to maintain prices, but it has been difficult. Since the full-scale anti-Japanese war on August 13, the source of paper has been scarce, and the price has become more expensive. In addition, transportation has become difficult and freight rates have increased sharply. The original list prices of books are insufficient to cover costs, making it even more difficult to maintain prices. As a last resort, in addition to general books, which are priced by various businesses at their discretion, the textbook prices have been submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval in accordance with the law. Starting today, all textbooks published by various businesses will be sold at a 30% increase over the original list price. The copyright pages of all printed and continuously reprinted textbooks will still show the original list price, but the price will be increased by 30% at the time of sale to prevent confusion due to different pricing for books printed at different times.</p>
<h3>Situation in Nanshi Stable</h3>
<p>City God Temple Also Opened; Moving Vehicles Have Disappeared</p>
<p>Since the residents of Nanshi heard the news that the disaster area could be realized, the trend of moving has been greatly reduced. This morning, the traffic between the Old North Gate and the Nanyang Bridge, which connect the two Chinese concessions, can be said to be completely free of moving vehicles. Most of the shops in the areas designated as refugee areas have opened for business, and the City God Temple, which has been closed since the outbreak of the war, has also opened its doors to welcome incense burners.</p>
<h3>(Brief Commentary)</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>Jinshanwei is the old path invaded by Japanese pirates in the Ming Dynasty, and it is an important area of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway today. Heavy troops should be stationed there. Moreover, the beach there is extremely vast, and large enemy ships cannot enter. How could the enemy army land safely in the heavy fog at dawn? Now the enemy army has reached Ye Xie, Song Yin, Zhang Yan, and Zhu Jing. Almost all of the southern part of Pudong has been occupied by the enemy. If they continue to advance directly to Fengjing, Jiashan, and Jiaxing, they can cut off the rear of our army in Pudong on the one hand, and control the important area of the Sujia Railway on the other hand. If the enemy crosses the Huangpu River and goes north, not only Songjiang and Qingpu will be disturbed by the enemy, but also our army in the Shanghai area will be threatened by the enemy. We hope that our military authorities will quickly send reinforcements to meet the enemy head-on and wipe out the remaining bandits. It may not be too late to mend the fold after a sheep is lost.</p>
<h3>Publication of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference Reply to Japan</h3>
<p>All Countries Have Interests in the Far East; Inviting Japan to Attend to Resolve Disputes</p>
<p>⊙Bai Luzhai'er The full text of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference application to Japan was published at 6:00 PM last night, with a total of seven points. The first point only mentions that Japan's reply to the invitation from the Belgian government was received on the 3rd of this month. The second point states that Japan's reply stated that Japan has no territorial ambitions in China and only wishes to help China in its material and moral development, and that it is willing to cooperate with other countries in China in economic and cultural matters, and respect the rights and interests of all countries in China. The third point states that the above-mentioned points of Japan are in line with the basic principles of the Nine-Power Treaty. The fourth point describes Japan's accusation against the Chinese government, stating that the Chinese government has forcefully stated that the Nine-Power Treaty has been broken by Japan. The fifth point strongly states that the Nine-Power Treaty has stipulated the clauses for dealing with such events, so the Brussels Conference was convened in order to seek a peaceful solution. Now the party to this dispute, China, has representatives participating in the meeting and has expressed its willingness to cooperate with the meeting as much as possible. However, Japan's non-attendance has caused the meeting to regret it, because Japan's cooperation is really desired. The sixth point states that Japan's reply stated that seeking solutions to Far East disputes together with countries whose interests in the Far East are different will only complicate the situation. The application therefore points out that all countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty have interests in the Far East and have been affected by the current war. The representatives of various countries in Beijing all hope to establish international peace and stability as soon as possible, and believe that the Japanese government can change its past policies and send one or two representatives to attend the meeting in order to exchange views and facilitate mediation to seek practical solutions to the conflict. The seventh point states that the conference hopes that Japan will send out a reply to this suggestion as soon as possible. (7th Kuomin Telegram)</p>

<h3>En Route to the Front Lines (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Communication from the Central News Agency, Shi Heng</p>
<p>The target of this bombing, it is said, was the army hospital. Because the hospital had taken in wounded soldiers, enemy planes have been pursuing the wounded soldiers' hospital again and again. What a hideous act this is! This is a stain that can never be washed away from the so-called "X Country X Unit" military reputation. Think about it, those ships with large red crosses painted on their tops, bearing ashes and wounded soldiers, are able to cross the sea safely.</p>
<p>Prompted by the bombs, we went to visit the wounded soldiers' hospital, but not the one that had just been bombed. That place had already been evacuated. The hospital director, Mr. Pan Dengfeng, received us very sincerely and gave a detailed account of the hospital's organization, the treatment of the soldiers, and the current situation. Afterwards, he even sent someone to lead us to visit the various wards. I seemed to have seen many descriptions of wounded soldiers or wounded soldiers' hospitals. Most of them are very excited, always hearing the wounded soldiers muttering in their sleep, "Kill! Kill! Advance and kill the enemy!" And using some overly exaggerated expressions. This may occasionally be true, but probably not always. At least, I didn't hear that. What I got in the ward was a different feeling, the complete opposite of that extreme excitement.</p>
<p>As soon as I walked into the ward, I was enveloped by an atmosphere of tranquility and solemnity. This atmosphere was like tear gas, making my tears well up. I have never loved soldiers because I have never seen their lovable side. Now heaven has revealed to me, allowing me to discover their good nature in their peace and quiet. I simply forgot my mission there. I forgot, as a journalist, the many tasteless clichés I had prepared in advance. I am very sorry, our "consolation" really disturbed the peace that was so precious to them.</p>
<p>At first, when they saw us come in, they showed surprise and unease. After the adjutant who led the way explained our purpose, they welcomed us with such humble and shy smiles. Before we had even offered our "consolation," they thanked us. They seemed ashamed of their injuries and unwilling to talk about anything. At the same time, we also felt an indescribable sense of embarrassment and couldn't ask anything. Journalists should originally have the art of conversation, but now this art seemed to have slipped away to some country. It took a lot of effort, and when both sides forgot themselves, we gradually chatted intimately. A battalion commander, whose left shoulder was pierced by a bullet, told us some fragments of the Cangzhou battle. Another soldier, wounded in the leg and retreated from the Songhu front line, told us about the situation on the Songhu front line. I think there is no need to record these talks because they are very fragmented. More precious than these talks was the scene when they were talking. That was like a painting by a great artist, which will be permanently engraved on my mind. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Enemy Troops Land in Sanmen Bay, Acting Recklessly</h3>
<p>Enemy warships provide artillery cover, enemy troops attempt to loot food, but are repelled by the local militia.</p>
<p>Ningbo Communication, At 8:00 AM on the 31st of last month, multiple enemy warships anchored in the Shepan waters of Sanmen Bay, providing artillery cover for motorized boats, landing enemy troops to loot food. The local Qinjiang, Sanmen, and other rural model militia brigades rose up in resistance, engaging in a fierce battle with the enemy troops at the shore of Dalowan (Jiantiaosuokou) for half an hour. The enemy finally gave way and retreated back to their ships. Beforehand, the enemy warships had remotely bombarded the area with artillery, firing over thirty shells that landed on Maotouzui, Dalowan, and other river mudflats, causing no losses to our side. When the enemy motorized boats approached Dalowan and the enemy troops attempted to wade through the mud to land, our militia suddenly launched a brave and courageous assault. At that time, seven or eight enemy troops were shot and fell to the ground. Seeing the situation was critical, the enemy warships immediately opened fire with machine guns. Our loyal and brave militia members He Jinde and Zhao Zhouchi were shot and martyred. Ye Daoxian and Zhao Xiaoshun were also wounded by gunfire. When the enemy warships retreated, they were rescued by their comrades and sent to Ninghai for medical treatment. In this battle, seven or eight of the enemy were seriously injured and carried back to their ships, their lives uncertain. On our side, besides the two squad leaders He and Zhao who died in battle, the injuries of the remaining squad leaders were not critical and there was no danger to their lives. The Zhejiang Sixth District Commissioner's Office and the Yin County Anti-Enemy Support Association expressed their deep respect for the militia's loyalty and bravery in resisting the enemy, and have remitted funds for condolence and compensation to the families of the martyrs.

<h3>The Embers of the Four Banks Warehouse Have Not Extinguished</h3>
<p>The Mainland Warehouse and the Four Banks Warehouse on North Suzhou Road and North Xizang Road were set on fire by the enemy after our lone army withdrew on the 30th of last month. After many days, the fire has not been completely extinguished. This morning, black smoke was still seen billowing out, and the smell of burning was still strong in the surrounding area.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Suffering of Residents in Zhabei and Baoshan</h3>
<p>The Massacre of Fire Brigade Members; The Enticement and Killing of Baoshan Refugees</p>
<p>After the enemy troops occupied Zhabei, they poisoned the residents. Now, the traitors in Baoshan County are enticing people to go there, resulting in tragic encounters. According to those who secretly came to Shanghai from the two places, the speakers were tearful and the listeners were furious. It is said that on October 26th, our army, due to strategic considerations, reluctantly withdrew from Zhabei. There were still more than 10,000 residents in Zhabei. On the morning of the 27th, some of these residents followed the army out, while others fled from the Nicheng Bridge area, crossing the river into the concession. When the enemy troops advanced into Zhabei on that day, the first thing they did was to set fire to the houses. The arson seemed to be done with a chemical made of sulfur, thrown into the houses, which immediately burned. Residents who did not have time to escape from the houses were mostly burned to death. Even if they escaped from the houses, the enemy troops immediately killed anyone under the age of forty upon seeing them. Three firefighters in Zhabei, due to their duty, were the last to leave Zhabei, intending to escape from the Sanban Factory New Bridge, across the Suzhou River to the concession. However, they were spotted by the enemy troops and immediately captured. They were forced to kneel on the ground. The three firefighters insisted on not yielding, showing the spirit of the great Chinese nation. In anger, the enemy troops took the doors from nearby civilian houses, stripped the three men of their clothes, leaving only their shirts and pants, and nailed their hands and feet alive to the doors with large iron nails. One door had two people nailed to the front and back, while the other door had only one person nailed to it. Not long after, another enemy soldier captured a police officer who had not had time to escape and was also stripped of his clothes and nailed alive to the back of another door. The enemy troops then used bayonets to stab the four men in the forehead, eyes, chest, and other places. Several residents who escaped from behind witnessed the cruelty. Two of them were so frightened that they fainted on the ground. The enemy soldiers spotted them and stabbed each of the two who had fallen to the ground (both over fifty years old with beards) in the legs before letting them escape, but both were almost half dead. It is also said that a woman, over forty years old, was stopped by two enemy soldiers while escaping in Zhabei. They were setting fires everywhere, accompanied by many traitors, and immediately burned any houses that were still intact, not allowing a single one to remain. When they saw the woman, they immediately stepped forward to stop her. The woman was extremely frightened. The enemy soldiers then ordered the woman to take off her outer clothes herself, deliberately humiliating her, and then poured the gasoline they had brought to set fires all over her body and threw her into the raging flames, burning her alive. All of this was witnessed by those who escaped. As for Baoshan County, after the enemy occupied it, the puppet county magistrate (Japanese) and the traitor Hu Lansheng (chairman of the puppet maintenance association) appointed by the enemy searched everywhere in the county's villages. A total of more than fifty people were found in the county, either old, frail, or thieves. The puppet county magistrate instructed the traitor to find ways to lure the Baoshan refugees back, giving them a flag with the words "Return to Baoshan." They said that there would be at least one yuan of income per day and that each person would be assigned work, and so on. About one thousand refugees followed to Shishan. Unexpectedly, the puppet county magistrate confined the lured people in the Guandi Temple, giving them only one meal a day, and had the enemy troops escort them to the fields to harvest cotton, which was loaded onto small steamers to Wusong and transferred to Japan. After the crops in the fields were harvested, everyone was assigned to search for scrap copper and iron in the destroyed or undamaged houses, regardless of size, and accumulate and collect them. Finally, the younger ones were selected and escorted to work on the front lines, while the older ones carried ammunition in the rear. Any slight delay would result in stabbing with bayonets. Of these one thousand people, about four-tenths had been injured or killed. It is also heard that the enemy troops plan to use the same method to lure poor people to Zhabei, which is also extremely cruel.</p>
<h3>Resistance</h3>
<p>— Zhao Lixing</p>
<p>In the blink of an eye, three or four months have passed since the start of the all-out resistance. Since the beginning of the war, our blood has been boiling at all times; our soldiers have been engaging the enemy with their flesh and blood everywhere. This has made the world know that peace-loving China is resisting invasion because it cannot bear to be invaded.</p>
<p>War is shameful, but submission to force is even more shameful; peace is precious, but a war of self-defense is even more precious. Because our country loves peace too much, it has caused all kinds of unfortunate events of losing sovereignty and humiliating the country for a hundred years.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the government's every concession to the violent Japanese shows our country's love of peace and the painstaking efforts to mediate for peace. But when it reached the point where it could not be tolerated, it naturally had to sacrifice peace in order to survive. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once said, "Peace will not be lightly sacrificed until the time of despair," which shows our country's consistent position on peace from beginning to end.</p>
<p>What the Japanese desire is non-resistance. What they adopt is to defeat each one individually. Repeated trials have all been successful. The three northeastern provinces were completely occupied in a few days, and Hebei and Chahar were obtained without effort. This is all because our country has not achieved complete spiritual unity, and each general is trying to preserve his own strength.</p>
<p>The peaceful resolution of the Xi'an Incident and the Liangguang Incident was nothing more than the result of various leaders recognizing the extreme aggression of the violent Japanese and not being able to kill each other again. And since these two events, our country has become increasingly spiritually united, and the anti-Japanese sentiment has been rising. At the same time, the Japanese aggression has become increasingly severe, forming the situation that "not resisting Japan is death, while resisting Japan is the only way to survive." The Japanese army repeatedly acted unreasonably at Lugou Bridge, so resistance naturally had to be launched.</p>
<p>Since the start of the resistance, in just a few days, it has made Japanese imperialism know that our country cannot be insulted. To conquer our country, a long-term war is necessary. The weakness of the economic ability of Japanese imperialism, the war-weariness of the soldiers, the bankruptcy of industry, commerce, and agriculture, and the difficulties in manpower and financial resources all make us know that a long-term war for Japanese imperialism is impossible. On the other hand, our country has a large population, a vast land, and abundant resources. This makes us know that our country can definitely fight a long-term war. Therefore, victory belongs to us more than to the Japanese.</p>
<p>The shame of a hundred years will be settled in one big reckoning from this resistance; the losses of past years can be recovered from this resistance. Resist! Resist! The washing away of the shame of past years, the compensation of losses, the creation of a new China, and the preservation of justice all depend on you.</p>
