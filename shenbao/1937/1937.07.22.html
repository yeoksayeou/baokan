<p>［北平］二十一晚六時許、冀北保安隊開進宛平縣城、城內我駐軍後撤、七時半後、前綫日軍亦向後移動、雙方距離在一千五百米突之掃射綫以外、期先避免衝突、然後再談商其他問題、七時許聞衙門口附近四格莊砲聲十餘響、卽係日軍撤退時之掩護砲、（二十一日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］雙方監視撤兵人員周永業等、二十一晚返平、聞我保安隊抵衙門口後、因日方監視極嚴、相持甚久、迭經交涉、始開始撤退、當我軍撤退時、日軍又開砲、現正抗議中、至盧溝橋宛平城、原為保安隊駐防、蘆溝橋衙門口日軍、二十一晚亦向後移動、傳大瓦窰徹•大井村•一帶日軍亦有後撤模樣、我軍駐八寶山部隊、於二十一晚七時二十分撤退、當撤退時、日軍又放六砲、現亦在抗議中、倘今明日軍不挑釁、局部可望暫安、（廿二日晨一時急電）</p>
<p>［北平］據二十一日晚由前綫來平之某軍官談、蘆溝橋及宛平縣我軍防地經二十日夜激戰後、迄未移動、我軍士氣甚旺、均抱為國犧牲决心、惟宛平縣城、前曾由石友三部保安隊援防、故二十日夜日軍向我猛烈攻擊時、我方以保安隊勢力單薄、不得已乃調一部軍隊增防、至盧溝橋方面、本由吉星文團駐守、二十日夜之戰、卽由此兩部奮力抵禦、至二十一日晨、日軍停止攻擊、我增援部隊、亦卽撤去、現宛平縣仍由保安隊固守、雙方監視撤兵人該地視察後、卽赴平西郊衙門口監視撤兵、我該地駐軍為表示和平解决、以促日方覺悟、當於二十一日下午一時、暫向後撤退、遺防由保安隊接替、至於八寶山我方駐軍、亦於二十一日晚七時二十分、撤退一部、當撤退時、日軍曾乘機向我發砲六響、傷我士兵數人、我軍未還擊、又大井村大瓦窰一帶日軍、截至發電時止、尚未撤去、（二十二晨中央社電）</p>

<p>［天津］冀北保安隊程希賢旅第二團、二十一晨八時開抵蘆溝橋接防、原駐當地軍隊奉令撤退、但截至下午四時止、因日軍未退、雙方仍相持中、平市空氣沉悶、謠言甚多、二十一晚七時十五分永定門鐵軌　拆毀交通阻斷、（二十一日專電）</p>
<p>［北平］我方赴盧換防之保安隊、行至門頭溝後、見日軍監視極嚴、日軍不僅亳無撤退模樣、且態度頑强、現仍由雙方人員交涉中、今明本為最緊要關頭、倘日軍仍無誠意、恐形勢卽轉惡化、我當局態度鎭定、前方士氣極盛、均抱誓死守士决心、（二十一日專電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>平津形勢緊張中作最後的忠告</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>十七日蔣委員長在廬山談話會第二次談話時。對於蘆溝橋事件。聲明我國的立塲。謂放棄寸士。便為千古罪人。和平關鍵。全擊日軍行動。這種光明正大的態度。至剛不屈的精神。宜博得各國輿論一致讚美也。但據咋報消息。平津形勢。驟形緊張。日軍全綫向我軍攻擊。兩度砲轟宛平城。戰事異常劇烈云云。若照這樣形勢看來。事態的惡化。業已完全展開。我人本和平息事的主張。於此最後的緊急關頭。對於日本朝野。再作一度最後的忠告。</p>
<p>第一。須要認淸蔣委員長迭次表示的不到最後關頭。我們决不願放棄和平。决不願輕言破裂。現在日本借蘆溝橋事件。為出兵之藉口。不惜調動大軍。侵犯華北。這眞是最後關頭已到。無論如何。我國决不會再退一步。再縮一寸日本認為我國酷愛和平。决下敢輕言抵抗。以為我國此種表示。是懼怯。是怕事。是不敢對日用兵。因此格外運用其威懾壓迫手段。以冀達到强佔華北目的。此種觀察。已屬完全錯誤。</p>
<p>第二。須要認淸華北事件。决非地方事件。日本一面調動各軍。大舉入犯。而一面則宣言事態不致擴大。以為此次事件。若果認為地方事件。則交涉易於解决。詎知河北的土地。一寸一尺。無一非我中華民國的土地。故蔣委員長謂。“如果蘆溝橋可以受人壓迫强佔則我們五百年故都北方政治文化的中心與軍事重鎭的北平。就要變成瀋陽第二。今日的北平。若果變成瀋陽。南京又何嘗不可變成北平”。故日方此種掩耳盜鈴的手段。决不會再生效力。我深望明白事理之日本朝野。及早覺悟。母貽後悔。</p>
<p>第三。須要認淸此次蘆溝橋事件。非但不是地方事件。而是中華民國的全國事件。非但不是中華民國的全國事件。恐怕還成為全球的事件。因為此次事件。倘能免於破裂則已。若不能避免。决非最短時間所能解决。萬一戰事延長。不但交戰國的損失不貲。而世界各國商業上之損害亦鉅。此種危險性的暴發。無論何人。决不能探測其究竟。故此事非特輕啟戰端之責任。應由日方負之。卽引起擴大戰爭。糜爛世界責任。亦應由日方負之。</p>
<p>第四。應該認淸我國民衆的心理。與我國的實力。因為現在我國的國家。决不是九一八以前的國家。雖不能說我國近年來在武備上與列强有同樣的進步。但至少限度。亦可背城戰一。并且自九一八—一二八之後。日方種種武力侵略行動。深刻於我國人民的心理。我們的民衆。欲一雪歷來的奇恥。已非一日。若此次戰事。一經發生則兵連禍結。衆志成城勝負之數。屬於何方殊未可必。</p>
<p>第五。應該認淸自已國內朝野的心理。此次日本軍閥。大舉入犯。輕啟釁端。是否為日本全民所同意。旣屬疑問。日本自法西斯主義者跋扈擅權。非但日本人民。無法反對。卽黨政要人。亦無從參與末議。并且日本近年國內的經濟情形。亦為舉世所共曉。若大兵一動。軍費浩繁經歷數年。如何支撑。國際情形。雖置不顧。而國內治安。應先考慮。</p>
<p>凡此數端。均為擺在目前的事實。與事援必至的影響。旣屬無從諱言。我深望日本當局。詳加考慮。勒馬懸崖為。禍為福有。目共見惟。解鈴繫鈴全。在日方並不在我。故當此最後緊急關頭。和平之門。尚未緊閉。昨日下午又接北平電。謂中日已商妥。雙方撤兵。各派專員三人。赴蘆溝橋前方監視。則雙方軍隊雖暫撤退。但以後有無別種變化。尚未可知。我望日本當局。痛自覺悟。急自反省。則戰端雖開。補敎餘地。應該尚有。務望日本野朝其熟思之。</p>

<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統今日宣稱、目下華北方面之中日衝突、當不至使美政府援用中立法云、（二十日國民電）</p>

<p>撤志願兵意存心延宕　堅主先討論監察問題</p>
<p>［倫敦］不干涉協定委員會今日九國代表　舉行會議、結果仍為僵局、已無期延會、擱淺原因為意國拒絕討論撤退志願兵問題、而德國代表李賓特羅甫且不出席云、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］各國意見現可分為英意兩大派、英方主張英國提案中　各點之需西戰雙方同意者、應先加討論、附和之者有法比捷等國、意方則主張一切提案須一律同意、然後再向西戰雙方提出、一時爭論極烈、惟雙方詞意尚不失其和善云、（中央社二十日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於西內亂不干涉問題調整委員會所屬小組委員會今晨開會、討論西國各港口設立監察制度一項問題之後、曾决定就撤退各國志願兵之問題立即加以討論、但意代表即駐英大使格蘭第表示反對、要求小組會先行討論取銷西國海面監察及恢復陸地邊境監察兩項問題、然後方可討論撤退志願兵及承認內戰當事雙方為交戰團體之問題、當由調整委員會主席即英外務次官樸萊茅斯勛爵加以駁復、謂今晨小組會所已决定之討論程序、非由各代表向各本國政府請訓之後、不能加以變動云云、因而小組委員會乃不得不無定期延會、各國代表團方面現期望小組委員會可於本星期五續行開會、在此時期以前、各國代表當可分頭與各本國政府磋商、惟一般人對於前途形勢均抱悲觀、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>巴力斯坦報吿書英上院熱烈辯論</h3>
<p>工黨議員多人表反對　阿族代表團蒞英請願</p>
<p>［倫敦］王家委員會主張將巴力斯坦分為三大區之報吿書、今日在上議院辯論甚烈、反對黨領袖斯尼爾首先發言、謂王家委員會似有一種論斷、以為巴力斯坦非至劃分後、决不能統一、惟以渠觀之、較善而最妥當之方法、在猶太與阿拉伯兩民族之諒解與合作、乃政府不俟國會有討論此事之機會、遽即贊同此報吿書、渠今代表工黨認瓜分巴力斯坦之提議、旣失公允且多危陰云、</p>
<p>王家委員會主席丕爾勳爵於歡呼聲中起立致詞、謂王家委員會在着手工作之初、無一不反對瓜分計劃、但結果則皆不得不採用之、渠以為巴力斯坦政府立法行政、以管理逈不相同之兩民族已大費經營、如其嘗試終歸失敗、則可吿其失敗之癥結、不在負代管之責者措施不善、但在其所須處置之性質與資料莫可駕馭耳、輸入巴力斯坦之猶太民族、决計不永為少數民族、而阿拉伯人當然以爲其本身或其子孫將在非其所可對敵之勢力下、陷於永刦不復之地位、委員會諸人於一再細心斟酌考量之後、始逐漸而有僅僅代管權之變更、尚屬無濟於事之論斷云殖民部次官杜斐林侯爵代表政府發言、謂巴力斯坦之時局、旣爲代管國所不堪容受、且亦危及代管國所當保護的人民之利益、今毅然結束此種局勢、非所以示弱、正所以示其有力量也、僅僅武力之運用、决非解决此難題之道、徒使阿拉伯人與猶太人間之仇隙愈深而已、政府旣决定接受此報吿書、不願再覩巴力斯坦任何一方重起爭論之行爲、政府今已接見阿拉伯人與猶太人之代表、並將考慮其意見、但若兩民族未以雙方同意、提出可爲政府接受之變更辦法、則政府不擬對於分劃區域之計劃、予以多大變更、此事已於本月提交國聯永久代管權委員會、政府之所以有此舉者、實欲此後步驟得以次第舉行舉多延時日也、將來獨立的阿拉伯國與猶太國欲加入國聯會時、政府定援助其請求、至於巴力斯坦各口岸各公路與鐵路之安全與其他權益之保護問題、當然另有關於海陸空軍之軍事公約云、</p>
<p>前任巴力斯坦第一任辦事大員薩繆爾子爵、對此報吿書指摘頗烈、尤不滿於瓜分計劃、謂猶太人應依允移民入境之限制、應承認阿拉伯人之國家、願望英國應以法國之同意、贊成大阿拉伯聯邦之組成、此舉在經濟上殊有益於巴力斯坦、而阿拉伯人亦應依允以阿拉伯人與猶太人雙方力量發展外約丹、英政府於此不妨担保借款、以助其發展、綜之、渠主張在巴力斯坦境內、設立用個民衆機關、而另置中央顧問會、以代表此兩民族、並以英員任諮詢職、同時英政府仍續施其代管權云、</p>
<p>坎特白里大主敎亦表示意見謂此項計畫須有更大之調査、但渠歡迎英國永久保護聖地與少數民族之辦法云、旋上院休會、定明日再行辯論、（中央社廿一日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］聞工黨議員多人不贊成瓜分巴力斯坦之提議、工黨議員瓊斯今日將在下院動議、先將此報吿書交國會推舉之委員會加以研究、而後再交國會决定之、衆料政府必拒絕此項動、以其將延緩此計劃之提交國聯行政院也、（中央社二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］巴力斯坦地方阿拉伯民族最高委員會主席赫賽尼、最近率同阿拉伯民族代表團前來英國、本日曾與英國國會議員多人會晤、當宣稱、阿拉伯民族最高委員會堅决反對劃分巴力斯坦為猶太邦阿拉伯邦與英國委任統治地之計畫、（按即係英國王家委員會所建議之辦法）認為此項計劃與國聯盟約第廿二條關於委任統治制度之條文互相抵觸、而與英政府以前迭次所作宣言、亦屬相背、且按照此項計劃、巴力斯坦境內最肥沃之土地均應屬於猶太邦、因此斷非阿拉伯民族所能接受云、（中央社二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>日軍增厚察北實力</h3>
<p>威脅晉綏卵翼匪偽　兼顧後方保護交通</p>
<p>張北通倌、日軍邇來旣陸續增調大軍開駐北寧綫及天津豐台等處、對於察北方面、復厚集兵力、咸脅緩晋、卵翼匪偽之滋長、茲將共在察北增兵情形、略紀如後、</p>
<p>增兵察北</p>
<p>張逆海鵬、爲偽‘滿洲’第五軍區（熱河）之領袖、其部隊約三萬餘人、騎兵居多、兵之素質、半係熱河壯丁、張海鵬徒擁虛名、其上中下各級幹部主要官長、均係日藉少壯軍人充任、去歲曾度開入察北、協同德王等叛逆侵犯綏東、最近日軍爲遂行其整個侵略計劃、又令該部西開、本月十六日、已有騎兵一旅開駐張北、茲復據確息、張部騎兵奉調入察者、尚有第四•第六•第八•第九•四旅．每旅一千八百餘騎、共計六千餘人、其第四旅旅長蘇木寶蘭、巳於十八日率部山熱河開抵察北之沽源、及大梁底一帶、第六•第八•第九•三旅、現均集中熱西經棚縣屬、待命西進、</p>
<p>戰機分配</p>
<p>在蘆案未發生前、日方即有以大批空軍威脅綏晉、保障察北叛逆、又有以大批海陆軍、分駛大沽秦皇等处、威脅冀察、保育冀東偽組織之說、現津平道上之軍事行動、已成事實、最近除增兵察北外、復有增撥大批飛機援助察北匪偽之訊、據謂將撥戰鬥機三百架為匪偽軍之助力、十八日、已有三十架集停於多倫機場、其餘均停於承德待命、截至十八日止、察北匪偽軍現有之飛機、共有四十九架、計停多倫者三十架、商都十二架、嘉卜寺七架、連日以來、亦間飛緩東百林廟紅格爾圖及其他各地、施行偵察、</p>
<p>撫誘民軍</p>
<p>現任張北縣搜查處偽處長艾烈成、原係王英部下軍官、後在楊守誠旅、與常子儀分任團長、旋改任目前偽職、最近日方增兵察北、即藉口攻擊民軍、至民軍方面、自李庭芬•李英•兩人退出後、所部山張仲英招集、惟張現在綏察邊境、李部多散處察東黑河川等處、聚集唯艱適予匪偽以利用之機會、故日方特准艾烈成招撫民軍、自成立偽一師、期使民軍潛消、反爲彼用、惟聞艾烈成雖已接受偽命、但尚未着手進行、</p>
<p>偽軍目的</p>
<p>據熟悉軍事之某君談、偽軍此次增防察北、其目的固不僅在威脅綏晋、寶亦別具作用、試就察北匪偽軍現在佈防情勢言之、當可瞭然、按察北地勢、及德王李守信兩部佈置情況、德王嫡系之五師、以嘉卜寺爲中心、並分駐康條•寶昌•沽源•多倫、以當百靈廟之衝、李守信嫡系三師、以張北爲中心所部分駐尚義•商都•南壕塹等處與綏東陶林紅格爾圖興和林對峙、兼顧張北崇禮一帶南面之防務、其軍事計畫、按地形規定、前方以商都為對緩作戰之文撑點、後方以多倫為熱西察北聯絡運輪之樞紐、張北崇禮、姑且不論、惟沽源與察南之獨石口逼近、就地形看、其連系運輸之樞紐、多倫時有被獨石口之突角衝斷危險、所以日方日前積極在沽源增兵、其目的雖為剿撫民軍、威脅綏晋、實係維護其交通孔道聯系之舉捩也、（十八日）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>是“最後關頭”了</h3>
<p>— 穆初</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事件不是地方事件，我們政府已經明確聲明，亦是民衆週知的事實；但是自從日方藉口走失一兵士而啟釁以來，就用種種不合法的手段來想當地解决，於是“和平”空氣不絕如縷，而宋哲元氏恰於這時候亦以“軍隊係國家所供養，本有應得之餉，抗敵為軍人天職，不應再受人民額外之賜”的“苦心”，把後方民衆慰勞廿九軍的捐款退了回來。我國雖然是酷愛和平的國家，酷愛和平的民族，但是“人爲刀爼，我為魚肉”的事實已經這樣明顯，“人家軍隊無限制的出入於我國的土地，而我們本國軍隊反要任受限制，不能在本國土地內自由駐在，或是人家向中國軍隊開槍，而我們不能還槍，”一個獨立國能夠這樣地被侮辱嗎？一個獨立國家的人民能夠這樣地被侮辱嗎？日本這幾年來所賜於我們的“親善”，我們再也不能忍受了；况且“我們的東四省失陷，已有了六年之久，繼之以塘沾恊定，現在衝突地點已到了北平門口的蘆溝橋，如果蘆溝橋可以受人壓迫强佔，那末我們五百年故都北方政治文化的中心與軍事重鎭的北平，就要變成瀋陽第二；今日的北平，若果變成昔日的瀋陽，今日的冀察，亦將成為昔日的東四省；北平若可變成瀋陽，南京又何嘗不可變成北平，所以蘆溝橋事變的推演，是關係中國國家整個的問題”。而關係於我們國家整個問題的事件，日本却想一手掩盡天下人的耳目，輕輕以地方事件為理由而欲遂其蠶食之野心。國家興亡，已經是“最後關頭”了，還能呌我們屆服而不起來抗戰嗎？</p>
<p>現在蔣委員長對於蘆溝橋事件已經提出極明顯的四點：㊀任何解决不得侵害中國主權與領土之完整；㊁冀察行政組織，不容任何不合法之改變；㊂中央政府所派地方官吏，如冀察政務委員會委員長宋哲元等，不能任人要求撤換；㊃第二十九軍現在所駐地區，不能受任何約束。這四點，是我們弱國外交最低限度，每一個中華民族的人民願意做“千古罪人”嗎？</p>
<p>現在是“最後關頭”了，前綫將士在和敵人作殊死戰的時候，後方民衆應“人人凖備以所有之資力物力，貢獻於國家”；“人人凖備以所有之知識技能，聽候國家之徵發調用”就是盡每個國民的義務，爭取國家之自由，民族之生存！</p>
<p>是“最後關頭”了！是“最後關頭”了！</p>
<h3>我們需要事實</h3>
<p>— 犁耕</p>
<p>事實是最好的鐵證，最好的闢謠利器，也唯有鐵般的事實，才會使人信服</p>
<p>蘆溝橋的事件，顯然是敵人整個强佔華北的序幕，無理的挑釁，自然有着目的，决非眞正的和平談判所能解决的，因為旣稱和平，當然要相平而和，然而敵人旣為尋事而來，豈肯“平”而“和”？至少也要弄成個“不平的和”，而不平的和是明明白白地說明了我們的屈辱，所以，在敵人整個的侵略之下，决沒有談判得“兩平而和”的可能性；那末，如此的和平談判，顯然中了敵人緩兵和各個擊破的奸計！</p>
<p>所幸，廿九軍奮勇的抵抗，制住了敵人的侵襲，挑起了全國人民的憤激奮起！而且負有冀察政務最大責任的宋哲元將軍說“不怕事，不惹事，不喪權，不辱國，”津市長張自忠也說“姓張的决不做對不起民衆的事”，廿九軍也决心“以蘆溝橋為墓”！一片忠勇壯烈的呼聲，很能使我們做國民的感到興奮！但是，說是說出了，實際呢？還是鑽到敵人的圈套裏去談判！自尋死路！這是豈非大煞風景？也因此，謠言起來了，人心不安了，種種都表現出了不需要如是的事實，也說明了這件事實的不滿於民心！</p>
<p>我們所需要的事實，是實踐廿九軍誓言，是明明白白的抗敵應戰！而决非是那類的和平談判！但是，我們不能不懷疑，不憂慮，擺在我們眼前的是“日軍四十萬來華”，“駐鮮日軍奉命開發”，“豐台日兵車圖開入平市”，“日軍仍攻宛平城，死傷甚多”等的令人憤激的消息，甚而至於“日機十八日下午一時飛彰德偵察，下午二時在平漢雙廂站以輕機關槍掃射，”在我們的國土內私自飛行已屬不法，開槍射擊列車，當然又是畜意尋釁，敵人如是的進行着滅亡我們的勾當，然而我們還是在“互表歉意”的和平談判！鐵般的事實。祇有使我們焦急！憤激！</p>
<p>以廿九軍過去光榮的史蹟。我們很能相信這次的誓言；决不是空頭支票我們也相信政府“寧爲玉碎，毋為瓦全”的决心。不惜犧牲的給打擊者以打擊！但是，敵人加緊着戰時的處置，源源不絕大軍的開到。而廿九軍的高級將領。還在商議着談判，是不是在實踐他們的誓言呢？我們需要抗戰：歡迎抗戰！不怕死。不怕犧牲，祇要是光榮的戰鬥！</p>
<p>我們一致的渴望着，渴望着我們需要的事實的實現！我們該大聲地吶喊：“我們需要事實”！</p>
<h3>草</h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>百壽老爹，自從春上他的大兒子王三上外面去找活，結果回來的祇有他那在水裏浸得發了胖的屍首以後，他便瘋了。</p>
<p>“人，是什麼？人是一顆草啊”不僅是他，卽使是同住在一個鎮上的老老少少，在這一番的“地獄”的空氣中呼息與生存過來的，誰都會感覺到，亂世的人的生命，太沒有保障了，年靑的人，在苦難中流浪，饑餓，被毀滅與殘殺，之後，那些濃濃的眉毛，結實的身體，粗濁的語音，魯直的笑與嘶呌……這一些，便全像一條魔鬼的暗影那麼地，漸漸地消失了，沒有影蹤了，他們彷彿走到了一個遠地的世界去，而事實上，又是永遠不再會回來了。僅僅是，在那些活着的相識者們的心上，留下了一片慘淡的影子。</p>
<p>—人，人就僅僅是一顆草！</p>
<p>“亂世的人亂世的人”百壽老爹</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>每天從惡夢中醒來的時候，屋外的天空總已經是帶着晨間的深藍色了。星星微微地閃霎着，田塲上，拂著斷續的曉風，野狗沿著阡隴，不斷地狺狺哮吠，於是，天色慢慢地亮起來，是早晨了。</p>
<p>早晨！城外的江邊上又集滿了人，百壽老爹遠遠地走近去的時候，人頭像針刺一樣的楚痛着。</p>
<p>‘今天，又是三個！’一個小伙子慘痛地走在路上，看見百壽老爹，便似相識非想織地說起來了：“老爹，您那麼大的年記，何苦？還是少來找苦受吧。江裹淹了你一個兒子，難道還有第二個淹活來不甚！走到家裹去坐着吧，告訴你了，今天就是三個！”</p>
<p>三個！百壽老爹昏昏地走向江邊去，順着下流，三個肢體枯萎的，瘠瘦而營養不良的屍體上下地盪動着，蒼黑色的身體已經被水浸漬成灰白了，浮腫的臉上綴巷可怕的，怨恨的眼睛∣他們底眼睛睜關着，像在切齒的仇恨中，他們需要不斷的看，看，看！</p>
<p>濁波把這些俘屍推向岸邊來了，人們都還着一種恐懼的，悲慘的，等待着就迫近在目前的命運之一繫的那種心情，爭着認看屍體的面貌｜在這些苦年頭中，自家的伙子與丈夫，好遠地衝着出去，幾年，幾個月……連半點訊息也不曾有過，也許，回來的時候已經就剩了在水裹的屍首了。為了生活，他們陷落在一個不㧞的泥坑裹，之援便像畜生那樣地，被悲慘地看待。“這些年，人是什麼，人是草呀！人……”大家都有百壽老爹一樣的感覺，每天，混濁的江水漂來幾個屍體，有的，被家人認出了面目，撲天撲地的撲向水裹去，號哭着—那聲音，幾乎是吼了，水裹，躺着婦女的丈夫，孩子的父親，而今，非人的酷慘使他們不明不白地躺在濁流裏……</p>
<p>這樣，本然地一帬人站在江邊上，恐懼地好遠就開始竭力認辨着那些浮屍的面目，準備，也許有自己的漢子在內的時候，就帶着那些破爛的　　　　同投向混濁的，擾攘的巨用裏去……</p>
<p>然而，浮屍是被警務人員打澇已，凄慘地橫陳在水灘上了，看的人髯了一口氣，為了這屍體中沒有自己所相識的人—他們都是那麼莫生的面目，他們是異鄉客，從停止了呼吸的內臟中，彷彿依舊在不斷地吐山遠鄉的泥土的氣息來—他們的妻子兒女，都不是在千里以外的客地中嗎？那麼想著，一陳陰慘的黑霧慢慢地攏罩了每個人的心情，“一個人，就死得那麼輕易啊……”</p>
<p>屍體上給蓋上蘆蓆了，凄凉地橫在水邊，江裏，濁流刺刺地拍激着，紙有那些中年以上的人，才垂到了沈沈的頭顱，他們在用同人類的溫情，默默地作下了績告—</p>
<p>“死去的，就早早昇天吧……”</p>
<p>早晨已經來了，可是依舊是陰沈的。人們知道，這一天是再不會有太陽了。靜寂中，祇有百壽老爹的可怕的瘋慼，依舊不住地在呌喚着從遠到近—</p>
<p>我說的嗎！“這年頭人的性命就像一顆草！我也活了七十關外了，夠了……人就像一顆草！”</p>

<h3>The Situation in the Lu Wan Area Turned Stable After the Fierce Battle the Previous Night</h3>
<p>Both sides agreed to retreat to avoid further conflicts. The Hebei Security Forces opened up Wanping County to take over defense. When our troops retreated, the Japanese army opened fire on us. It is rumored that a unit of the Japanese army has also moved towards the rear.</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Representatives from China and Japan in Tianjin formally agreed on a preliminary resolution to the Lugouqiao Incident on the evening of the 20th. After the suburbs of Ping were subjected to artillery fire again, the front line turned calm after 4:00 AM on the 21st. At 8:00 AM, Cheng Xixian, the brigade commander of the Hebei Security Brigade, and Sakurai, a Japanese advisor, went to Lugouqiao to monitor the troop withdrawal. The garrison defense was taken over by Shi Yousan's security force. It is heard that the Japanese army is also preparing to withdraw to its original location, but the Japanese side is still very busy with military deployments, and there are many thorns ahead, which cannot be predicted. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Around 6:00 PM on the 21st, the Hebei Security Forces entered Wanping County. Our garrison in the city retreated. After 7:30 PM, the Japanese army on the front line also moved backwards. The distance between the two sides was beyond the range of 1,500 meters to avoid conflict, and then other issues will be discussed. Around 7:00 PM, more than a dozen cannons were heard near Sigezhuang near Yamenkou, which was the covering fire for the Japanese army's retreat. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Zhou Yongye and others who monitored the troop withdrawal on both sides returned to Ping on the evening of the 21st. It was heard that after our security team arrived at Yamenkou, the Japanese supervision was very strict. After repeated negotiations, the withdrawal began. When our army retreated, the Japanese army opened fire again, and a protest is currently underway. Lugouqiao Wanping City was originally stationed by the security team. The Japanese army at Yamenkou in Lugouqiao also moved backwards on the evening of the 21st. It is rumored that the Japanese army in the area of Dawayao and Daicun also had a posture of retreating. Our troops stationed at Babao Mountain retreated at 7:20 PM on the 21st. When they retreated, the Japanese army fired six cannons again, and a protest is also underway. If the Japanese army does not provoke today or tomorrow, local peace can be expected temporarily. (Urgent telegram at 1:00 AM on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to a military officer who came to Ping from the front line on the evening of the 21st, our military defense positions at Lugouqiao and Wanping County have not moved since the fierce battle on the night of the 20th. Our army's morale is very high, and they are all determined to sacrifice for the country. However, Wanping County was previously defended by the security team of Shi Yousan, so when the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on us on the night of the 20th, we had to deploy a unit of troops to increase the defense because the security team was weak. As for Lugouqiao, it was originally stationed by Ji Xingwen's regiment. The battle on the night of the 20th was fought by these two units. By the morning of the 21st, the Japanese army stopped attacking, and our reinforcements also withdrew. Now Wanping County is still firmly defended by the security team. After the personnel monitoring the troop withdrawal inspected the area, they went to Yamenkou in the western suburbs of Ping to monitor the troop withdrawal. Our garrison in the area temporarily retreated to promote Japanese awareness in order to show a peaceful resolution. At 1:00 PM on the 21st, the defense was handed over to the security team. As for our garrison at Babao Mountain, they also withdrew a unit at 7:20 PM on the 21st. When they withdrew, the Japanese army took the opportunity to fire six shots at us, wounding several of our soldiers. Our army did not return fire. Furthermore, as of the time of the telegram, the Japanese army in the area of Daicun and Dawayao had not withdrawn. (Central News Agency telegram on the morning of the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Both Sides Sent Personnel to Monitor Troop Withdrawal</h3>
<p>[Beiping] From 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM this morning was the time for both sides to withdraw their defenses on the front line of Lugouqiao and for the security team to take over the defense. Our side sent Cheng Xixian, Zhou Yongye, and Zhou Sijing, while the Japanese side sent Sakurai, Nakajima, and Kasai to monitor. Twenty Japanese reconnaissance planes departed from Tongxian at 9:30 AM this morning, passed through Ping City, and went to the front line to monitor the troop withdrawal. They flew very low, and the engine noise was loud. Today and tomorrow are the most critical moments for peace. If the Japanese still do not withdraw after our troop withdrawal, a war will be inevitable. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] After the fierce conflict between Chinese and Japanese troops in the Lugouqiao area on the evening of the 20th, personnel from both sides met once on the morning of the 21st to discuss an immediate ceasefire. Both sides began to withdraw their troops, so they notified the front-line troops to stop the conflict. Our side sent Zhou Sijing and Zhou Yongye, while the Japanese side sent Nakajima and Sakurai to the front line by car at 9:30 AM on the 21st to monitor the troop withdrawal. (Central News Agency telegram from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Japanese army's ravages in the suburbs of Ping have aroused national outrage. According to news in the afternoon of the 21st, after the fierce war at Lugouqiao on the 20th, peace seemed to have a slight sign, because personnel from China and Japan met on the morning of the 21st to negotiate a ceasefire. Our side sent Zhou Enjing and Zhou Yongye, while the Japanese side sent Nakajima and Sakurai to the front line to monitor the troop withdrawal. According to transportation circles, our authorities stationed in Ping strictly adhered to their position. In order to show their love of peace, they have temporarily withdrawn the troops on the front line of Lugouqiao by two li. The Japanese side claimed that they would begin to withdraw on the 22nd, so the key to the Japanese side's preliminary expression of sincerity for peace lies in their actions on the 22nd. If the Japanese army still has no sincerity on the 22nd and does not withdraw quickly, then the responsibility for destroying peace is obvious. Our original front-line troops cannot but move forward again, and the defense of Beiping will be the responsibility of Zhao Dengyu and others. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Zhou Sijing and Nakajima, personnel from China and Japan monitoring the troop withdrawal, went to the front lines of Lugouqiao Wanping County and Yamenkou Babao Mountain on the morning of the 21st to negotiate the troop withdrawal. As there was a considerable result, they returned to Ping after 10:00 PM on the 21st. Zhou immediately reported the negotiation situation to Qin Dechun. (Central News Agency telegram from the 21st)</p>
<h3>Troop Withdrawal Negotiations Once Stalled</h3>
<p>[Beiping] Sun Pei Wu, the deputy commander of the security team who was wounded in the fierce battle in Wanping last night, came to Ping today for medical treatment. In order to show our sincerity for peace, our side sent the Hebei Security Team Cheng Xixian's troops to take over the defense of Lugouqiao and the western part of the bridge from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 21st. However, the Japanese troops east of Lugouqiao have not yet withdrawn. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The second regiment of the Hebei Security Team Cheng Xixian's brigade arrived at Lugouqiao at 8:00 AM on the 21st to take over the defense. The original troops stationed there were ordered to withdraw, but as of 4:00 PM, the two sides were still deadlocked because the Japanese army had not withdrawn. The atmosphere in Ping City was gloomy, and there were many rumors. The railway tracks at Yongdingmen were destroyed at 7:15 PM on the 21st, disrupting traffic. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Our security team that went to Lugouqiao to change defenses saw that the Japanese army's supervision was extremely strict after arriving at Mentougou. Not only did the Japanese army not show any signs of withdrawing, but their attitude was also stubborn. Negotiations are still underway between the two sides. Today and tomorrow are the most critical moments. If the Japanese army still has no sincerity, the situation may deteriorate immediately. Our authorities are calm, and the morale of the front line is very high. (Dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to reliable sources, our security team was originally scheduled to take over the defense of Lugouqiao from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM on the 21st, but because the Japanese army on the front line was defending and supervising very strictly, it was not easy to take over the defense. As of 4:00 PM, the security team had not yet taken over the defense. (Central News Agency telegram from the 21st)</p>

<h3>Our Army Retreats First to Show Peace</h3>
<p>[Beiping] The local authorities have always advocated a peaceful resolution to the Lugouqiao Incident. On the morning of the 21st, they ordered the troops stationed in various front-line areas west and north of Lugouqiao to temporarily retreat one or two li. The defense was taken over by Shi Yousan's security team in order. Cheng Xixian, the first brigade commander of the security team, led his troops to take over the defense from 10:00 AM on the 21st. If the Japanese army does not attack during our security team's change of defenses, the change of defenses can be completed by 12:00 PM. According to relevant sources, our side's prior withdrawal of troops is a solid proof of peace, and it also promotes the Japanese side's awareness. If the Japanese army still does not comply with the agreement to withdraw its troops after our army withdraws and deliberately provokes a challenge, it has been seen by the world. If the unfortunate incident expands, the responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side. (Central News Agency telegram from the 21st)</p>
<p>[Beiping] The cause of the conflict between the Chinese and Japanese troops in the Lugouqiao area on the afternoon of the 20th, according to relevant sources, was that the Japanese garrison notified our army on the evening of the 19th, setting a deadline for the withdrawal. We believe that the Japanese army has repeatedly broken its promises, and the Japanese withdrawal should be carried out jointly by both sides. Today, the Japanese army actually asked us to withdraw our troops alone, and their lack of sincerity can be seen. Our army did not respond to this, and the Japanese army began to attack us, which led to a fierce war. Our army is responsible for defending the soil, and should severely attack the illegal actions of the Japanese army. The Lugouqiao stone bridge and Wanping County were severely damaged by Japanese artillery fire, but according to investigations, the Japanese casualties were higher than those of our army. The fighting stopped on the morning of the 21st. (Central News Agency telegram from the 21st)</p>

<h3>Final Advice Amid Tense Situation in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>— Blow</p>
<p>During his second speech at the Lushan Conference on the 17th, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated China's position on the Lugouqiao Incident, saying that abandoning even an inch of land would make one a traitor for eternity. The key to peace, he said, lies in the actions of the Japanese army. This upright and unyielding spirit should be praised by international public opinion. However, according to yesterday's news, the situation in Beiping and Tianjin has suddenly become tense. Japanese troops have launched a full-scale attack on our forces, shelling Wanping City twice, and the fighting is said to be extremely fierce. Given this situation, the crisis has completely unfolded. While we advocate a peaceful resolution, at this final, critical juncture, we offer one last piece of advice to the Japanese government and public.</p>
<p>First, it must be recognized that Chairman Chiang has repeatedly stated that we are unwilling to abandon peace or lightly speak of rupture until the very last moment. Now, Japan is using the Lugouqiao Incident as an excuse to dispatch troops and invade North China. This truly marks the arrival of the last moment. No matter what, China will not retreat any further. Japan believes that China cherishes peace and dares not easily resist, taking China's expressions as fear, timidity, and unwillingness to use force against Japan. Therefore, they are intensifying their intimidation and oppression tactics in hopes of forcibly occupying North China. This assessment is completely wrong.</p>
<p>Second, it must be recognized that the North China Incident is by no means a local incident. Japan mobilizes its armies for large-scale invasion, while simultaneously declaring that the situation will not escalate. They believe that if the incident is considered a local matter, negotiations will be easier to resolve. However, every inch of Hebei's land belongs to the Republic of China. As Chairman Chiang stated, "If Lugouqiao can be oppressed and forcibly occupied, then Beiping, the center of our five-hundred-year-old capital's northern political culture and military stronghold, will become another Shenyang. If Beiping becomes Shenyang today, then why can't Nanjing become Beiping?" Therefore, this ostrich-like behavior on the part of Japan will no longer be effective. We sincerely hope that the sensible members of the Japanese government and public will awaken as soon as possible and avoid future regrets.</p>
<p>Third, it must be recognized that the Lugouqiao Incident is not only a national event for the Republic of China, but also potentially a global event. If this incident can be prevented from escalating, that would be best. However, if it cannot be avoided, it will not be resolved in the short term. Should the war drag on, not only will the losses for the warring countries be immeasurable, but the commercial damage to countries around the world will also be enormous. No one can predict the extent of this dangerous outbreak. Therefore, the responsibility for initiating hostilities lies with Japan, as does the responsibility for triggering an expanded war and devastating the world.</p>
<p>Fourth, the psychology of the Chinese people and our country's strength should be recognized. The country we have now is not the same as the one before September 18th. While we cannot say that China has made the same progress in military preparedness as the major powers in recent years, we can at least put up a fight. Furthermore, since the September 18th and January 28th incidents, Japan's various acts of military aggression have been deeply etched in the minds of the Chinese people. Our people have longed to avenge the historical humiliation for some time. If this war breaks out, it will be a continuous string of battles, and the combined will of the people will form a fortress. It is by no means certain who will win.</p>
<p>Fifth, the psychology of one's own country, both the government and the people, should be recognized. It is questionable whether the current large-scale invasion by the Japanese military is agreed upon by the entire Japanese population. With fascists rampant and exercising power arbitrarily in Japan, not only can the Japanese people not oppose them, but even important party and government officials cannot participate in the final deliberations. Moreover, Japan's domestic economic situation in recent years is known to the world. If a large army is mobilized, the enormous military expenditure will last for several years. How can they sustain it? While international affairs may be disregarded, domestic security should be considered first.</p>
<p>All of these are facts and inevitable consequences that are currently before us. Since they cannot be denied, we sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities will carefully consider their actions and stop before it is too late. Good or bad fortune is plain for all to see. The solution lies entirely with Japan, not with us. Therefore, at this final, critical juncture, the door to peace has not yet been completely closed. Yesterday afternoon, we received another telegram from Beiping stating that China and Japan have reached an agreement to withdraw troops and send three commissioners each to the front lines at Lugouqiao to monitor the situation. While the troops from both sides have temporarily withdrawn, it is still unknown whether there will be other changes in the future. We hope that the Japanese authorities will deeply awaken and urgently reflect on their actions. Even if war has broken out, there should still be room for remediation. We urge the Japanese government and the public to carefully consider this.</p>
<h3>British Government Closely Watching Developments in the Far East</h3>
<p>Continues Close Contact with Other Countries; Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in London Suspended; US Not Yet Considering Invoking Neutrality Act</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that while the British government hopes to have talks with Japan, it would be inappropriate given the current situation in North China. He has communicated this opinion to the Japanese government. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>[London] The Sino-Japanese situation was again a topic of questioning in the British House of Commons today. In response to a question from Liberal MP Mander, Foreign Secretary Eden stated that the British government continues to regularly consult with other governments, both members and non-members of the League of Nations, regarding the current situation in the Far East. These consultations are currently being conducted through diplomatic channels on a daily basis. To the best of his knowledge, he believes that Mander's suggestion to submit the matter to the Council of the League of Nations would not necessarily improve the situation. Conservative MP Looch asked what obligations the UK has under the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant in the North China dispute. Eden replied that neither the Nine-Power Treaty nor the Kellogg-Briand Pact currently bind the British government in the current dispute, nor do any obligations arise under the League of Nations Covenant. Eden later answered a question from Labour MP Thurtle, stating that the status of consular jurisdiction in China remains unchanged. Eden also answered a question from Conservative MP Macmillan, stating that the Foreign Office has received the British Ambassador's criticism of China's insurance law and is currently considering it. (Reuters dispatch, 21st)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry stated today that when British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Japanese Ambassador Shigeru Yoshida in London, he proposed that the UK mediate the Sino-Japanese situation, but Japan has not yet responded. He could not say whether the Japanese government would respond. The spokesman also said that he had not heard the details of the agreement reached on Monday night in Tianjin between the Chief of Staff of the Japanese Army in North China, Hashimoto, and representatives of the 29th Army. Last night, the Japanese Cabinet decided to take appropriate defensive measures necessary to implement the terms of the agreement and authorized Minister of the Army Sugiyama to handle the matter.

<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt declared today that the current Sino-Japanese conflict in North China is unlikely to cause the US government to invoke the Neutrality Act. (National News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin The Hamburg "Overseas Daily" recently published an article commenting on the international impact of the Sino-Japanese incident, believing that Britain could not stand idly by as Japanese power developed and penetrated deep into the Chinese hinterland. "As the situation in the Far East becomes increasingly tense, it is no wonder that British Foreign Secretary Eden, in his speech in the House of Commons yesterday, felt the need to handle the various misunderstandings in Europe in recent months with a spirit of compromise." The newspaper added that Eden's tone towards Italy in his speech was quite gentle, which was also due to Britain's concern for its interests in the Far East.

<p>[Berlin] The Sino-Japanese dispute is highly valued by German political figures. Various newspapers have also published lengthy news reports. The Nazi Party's organ, the "People's Observer," also commented, stating that "Japan's actions in North China are a meticulous preparation for dealing with the Soviet Union. It is a pity that China and Japan are thus mutually hostile, making it difficult to expect their five-power cooperation to resist Bolshevism." (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st, Havas)</p>
<h3>French Press Comments</h3>
<p>Mostly Express Sympathy Towards Us</p>
<p>[Paris] Left-wing and right-wing newspapers in France continue to comment on the Sino-Japanese issue, refusing to speculate on the progress of the negotiations between the two sides. The majority still express sympathy towards China. The Catholic "Morning News" stated, "It is impossible to distort the right and wrong between China and Japan. Anyone who considers Japan to be right is either naive or malicious. Some political systems are waiting for war, some are hoping for war, and some are creating war. Japanese imperialism is one example." The right-wing "Figaro" stated, "Japan's bellicosity cannot be denied. While intimidation may be a clever tactic, it is a question whether Japan is underestimating China if it seeks a swift victory through this means." The Communist "Humanity" stated, "Even though Britain has reached an understanding with Japan, we still shout Long Live China!" The extreme right-wing "Small Daily" stated, "Britain has adopted a cautious attitude, the United States is reserving its freedom of action, France is also adopting a cautious attitude, Soviet Russia may intervene, and Germany and Italy are bound by the Anti-Comintern Pact and cannot extricate themselves. In total, it is feared that no major country will intervene." (Central News Agency dispatch, 21st, Havas)</p>

<h3>Bandits and Puppets in Northern Chahar Very Busy with Movements</h3>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] The situation of the bandits and puppets in Chaharhua has been very shifty recently. Although they claim to be invading westward, the troops are moving eastward. Two regiments of the puppet 6th Division have moved east from the Public Association, and the destination is not yet known. De Wang has also ordered the entire Zhangbei County to provide 20 vehicles per village, a total of 440 vehicles from 22 villages. The puppet army's horses have all been reshod with new horseshoes since the 20th, and the horseshoe business in various places has suddenly prospered. The situation is tense, and they are preparing for a major battle. However, according to general observations, this action by the bandits and puppets is actually due to the Lugouqiao Incident being unresolved, fearing that the southern defense is tight. Therefore, they are increasing their troop strength and maintaining the connection between Rehe and Chahar. It is also rumored that the bandits and puppets are prepared to abandon western Chahar if necessary and hold firm in eastern Chahar and Rehe. (Special dispatch, 21st)</p>

According to a telegram from the bureau on the 19th, Chinese shipping is proceeding as usual. Tangshan Institute of Technology of Jiaotong University reported on the 20th that Japanese troops had entered and were stationed there.

<h3>France to Cut Budget by 6 Billion Francs</h3>
<p>Reduction of 2.5 Billion in Next Term; Defense and Construction Spending Maintained; Debt Fund Established Outside Exchange Fund</p>
<p>[Paris] Finance Minister Bonnet recently made a speech, first explaining various financial events of the past three weeks, and said, "The first stage of the financial recovery has now been completed. For example, tax revenues can be increased by 8,000,000,000 francs, so that the regular budget can be restored to balance. However, this is not enough. All temporary budget expenditures that increase the burden on the treasury must be reduced. Regarding this, we have also formulated a plan to reduce the treasury burden by 6,000,000,000 francs in the last months of 1937 and by 25,000,000,000 francs throughout 1938. However, expenditures on defense and public works will still reach approximately 15,500,000,000 francs, of which 3,500,000,000 francs will be borne by the government, and the remainder will be borne by the provinces." (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the issue of financial consolidation, the Council of State passed a delegated legislative decree this morning, which will be promulgated and implemented tomorrow. The Council of State also decided to establish a public debt stabilization fund to stabilize public debt prices, with uses similar to those of the exchange equalization fund. Its source will be funds from the Bank of France, derived from the surplus obtained from the second devaluation of the franc. As for reducing treasury expenditures, the Council of State has not determined the amount and will be decided jointly by Premier Chautemps, Finance Minister Bonnet, Minister of Agriculture Monnet, Minister of the Interior Dormoy, and Minister of Education Zay. In addition, all special expenditures of a recurring nature will be incorporated into the regular budget in the future to reduce the burden on the treasury. However, the government will faithfully fulfill all its promises. Therefore, large-scale projects that the government has previously promised to allocate 3,400,000,000 francs will continue to be carried out. As for economic construction and unemployment relief, the government will still raise 12,000,000,000 francs to 14,000,000,000 francs for application. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th, Havas)</p>
<h3>International Trade Statistics for Last Year</h3>

<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations publication "World Trade Statistics 1936" states that the total value of world imports and exports last year was US$25,621,000,000, an increase of 8% compared to 1935, but only one-third of that in 1929.

<h3>Japanese Ministry of Finance Decides to Redefine Gold Reserves</h3>
<p>From 500 Million to 1.3 Billion - London Believes It Relates to the Tense Situation</p>
<p>Special Parliament to be Convened Tomorrow</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It is reported that the Ministry of Finance has decided to submit two proposals to the Special Parliament: to redefine the gold reserves of the Bank of Japan and to establish an exchange equalization fund. The redefined rate has not yet been disclosed, but it is expected to be 10% lower than the world gold market price. The current value of Japan's gold reserves is 500 million yen (1.33 yen per gram), which will now be redefined to be worth around 1.3 billion yen (3.5 yen per gram). The government will thus obtain a net profit of 800 million yen, and use 600 million yen of it as an exchange equalization fund. It is said that this move should not be interpreted as a devaluation of the Japanese yen by law, as the Japanese government does not want to reduce the gold content of Japanese coins. (Reuters, 21st, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The news of the Japanese government's decision to redefine gold reserves reached London too late to affect the London market. However, bankers related to the Far East are currently discussing the implications of this move by Japan. At a time when the Sino-Japanese situation is very tense, this news has come suddenly. Informed sources generally believe that this move is related to the current situation. However, some also believe that it is necessary to establish a fund to protect the Japanese yen, as this is the only way to maintain the Japanese currency and prevent it from being pressured by the panic in the North China situation. (Reuters, 21st, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The 71st Special Parliament is scheduled to be convened on the 23rd. All parties in the Seiyukai, Minseito, and Social Masses Party, as well as the House of Representatives, except for Kokumin Domei, will convene a general meeting of members on the 22nd to discuss countermeasures and decide on matters such as the chief secretaries of the house to consolidate their ranks. On the 23rd, when Parliament is convened, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives will be elected. On the 24th, the inauguration will take place, and on the 25th, the opening ceremony will be held. The actual deliberation will begin with the Prime Minister's policy address, starting from the 27th. The deliberation period is only 12 days. Given the serious implications of the North China Incident, the Parliament will proceed with its deliberations smoothly in a spirit of national unity.

<h3>Major Reshuffle of French Ambassadors Abroad</h3>
<p>[Paris] Following the appointment of French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, as Minister of Finance in the Chautemps Cabinet, there is much speculation about the reshuffle of ambassadors abroad. "Le Petit Parisien," which often carries semi-official news, claims that it is not impossible for the current Ambassador to Russia, Cambon, to be transferred to the United States. Although the newspaper did not mention how the vacancy for the Ambassador to Russia would be filled, it clearly stated that the current Ambassador to Valencia, Norbert, would be transferred to another country. The newspaper also stated that there are rumors of a change in the Ambassador to Belgium. The French Ambassador to Belgium, Laroche, had intended to resign last autumn, but Leopold III's retention extended his term. It is said that the former Director of Political Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Baelen, is now proposed to succeed as Ambassador to Belgium. (Guomin Haitong Telegram, 21st)</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Spain</h3>
<p>Rebels Capture New Positions - Northwestern Town Reduced to Ashes</p>
<p>Madrid - Rebel forces launched another attack on the Madrid front at dawn today. The northwest was ablaze, not extinguished overnight, indicating that the fighting has not stopped.

<p>Madrid - Today, government troops and Nationalist forces engaged in a fierce battle for five hours, with continuous artillery fire. Nationalist forces finally captured an important strategic location between the northwestern suburb of Brunete and the village of Villanueva de la Cañada. Although government troops resisted heroically, they had to retreat to the second line of defense due to heavy artillery and air bombardment by Nationalist forces. Villanueva de la Cañada has been reduced to rubble after being bombed. Casualties on both sides number in the hundreds. Under the scorching sun, the two armies are still fighting fiercely, and the scene is extremely tragic. Since the Nationalist forces launched their counteroffensive three days ago, the front lines of the two armies have not changed significantly compared to three days ago, from the village of Navalcarnero southwest of the town of Valdemorillo, which was attacked by government forces, to the village of Berrinches, 10 kilometers southwest of Brunete.

<h3>Non-Intervention Committee Meeting on the Spanish Civil War Encounters Setbacks Again</h3>
<p>Intent to Delay the Withdrawal of Volunteers - Insisting on Discussing the Issue of Supervision First</p>
<p>[London] Today's meeting of representatives from nine countries on the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee resulted in a stalemate again and was adjourned indefinitely. The reason for the stalemate was that Italy refused to discuss the issue of withdrawing volunteers, and the German representative, Ribbentrop, did not attend. (Guomin Telegram, 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Opinions among countries can now be divided into two major factions: British and Italian. The British side advocates that the points in the British proposal that require the consent of both sides of the Spanish war should be discussed first. Countries such as France, Belgium, and Czechoslovakia support this view. The Italian side, on the other hand, advocates that all proposals must be agreed upon uniformly before being submitted to both sides of the Spanish war. The debate was intense, but the language of both sides remained amicable. (Reuters Telegram, 20th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] The subcommittee under the Adjustment Committee on the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention met this morning to discuss the issue of establishing a monitoring system in Spanish ports. After deciding to immediately discuss the issue of withdrawing volunteers from various countries, the Italian representative, Ambassador to England Grandi, expressed his opposition and requested the subcommittee to first discuss the two issues of abolishing the naval surveillance of Spain and restoring land border surveillance before discussing the issue of withdrawing volunteers and recognizing the two parties involved in the civil war as belligerent entities. This was refuted by the chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Plymouth, who stated that the discussion procedures already decided by the subcommittee this morning could not be changed without the representatives consulting their respective governments. As a result, the subcommittee had to adjourn indefinitely. The delegations from various countries now hope that the subcommittee can continue to meet this Friday. Before this time, the representatives of various countries can separately consult with their respective governments. However, the general public is pessimistic about the future situation.

<h3>Palestine Report Vigorously Debated in the British House of Lords</h3>
<p>Many Labor Party Members Express Opposition - Arab Delegation Arrives in England to Petition</p>
<p>[London] The report of the Royal Commission advocating the division of Palestine into three major districts was debated fiercely in the House of Lords today. Opposition Leader Snell spoke first, stating that the Royal Commission seemed to have a judgment that Palestine could not be unified until it was divided. However, in his view, the better and more appropriate method lies in the understanding and cooperation between the Jewish and Arab peoples. The government immediately endorsed this report without giving Parliament an opportunity to discuss the matter. He now represents the Labor Party in believing that the proposal to partition Palestine is unfair and fraught with danger.</p>
<p>Lord Peel, chairman of the Royal Commission, rose to speak amidst cheers, stating that at the beginning of their work, everyone on the Royal Commission opposed the partition plan, but in the end, they all had to adopt it. He believed that the Palestinian government's legislative and administrative efforts to manage two vastly different ethnic groups had been a great undertaking. If their attempts ultimately fail, the failure should be attributed not to the poor measures taken by those responsible for the mandate, but to the intractable nature and materials they had to deal with. The Jewish people entering Palestine are determined not to remain a minority forever, and the Arabs naturally believe that they themselves or their descendants will be trapped in a permanently irrecoverable position under a force they cannot defeat. After repeated careful consideration, the members of the commission gradually came to the conclusion that even a mere change of mandate rights would be of no avail.</p>
<p>The Marquis of Dufferin and Ava, Undersecretary of State for the Colonies, spoke on behalf of the government, stating that the situation in Palestine has become unbearable for the mandatory power and endangers the interests of the people the mandatory power is supposed to protect. Now, resolutely ending this situation is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength. The mere use of force is by no means a solution to this problem; it will only deepen the animosity between the Arabs and Jews. The government has decided to accept this report and does not want to see any party in Palestine restart the debate. The government has now met with representatives of the Arabs and Jews and will consider their opinions. However, if the two ethnic groups do not present changes that are acceptable to the government by mutual agreement, the government does not intend to make major changes to the plan for dividing the region. This matter has been submitted to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations this month because the government wants future steps to proceed gradually and without delay. When the independent Arab state and Jewish state seek to join the League of Nations in the future, the government will assist their requests. As for the protection of the security of Palestine's ports, roads, and railways, and other rights and interests, there will of course be separate military conventions regarding the army, navy, and air force.</p>
<p>Viscount Samuel, the former first High Commissioner for Palestine, criticized this report harshly, especially dissatisfied with the partition plan, stating that the Jews should abide by the restrictions on immigration, should recognize the Arab state, and wish that Britain, with the consent of France, would support the formation of a Greater Arab Federation. This move would be particularly beneficial to Palestine economically, and the Arabs should also agree to develop Transjordan with the strength of both Arabs and Jews. The British government may wish to guarantee loans to help its development. In summary, he advocated the establishment of popular civil institutions in Palestine, with a separate central advisory council representing the two ethnic groups and British officials serving in an advisory capacity. At the same time, the British government should continue to exercise its mandate.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Canterbury also expressed his opinion, saying that this plan requires greater investigation, but he welcomed Britain's permanent protection of the Holy Land and minorities. The House of Lords then adjourned and is scheduled to debate again tomorrow. (Reuters Telegram, 21st, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] It is reported that many Labor Party members do not approve of the proposal to partition Palestine. Labor Party member Jones will move in the House of Commons today to have this report first submitted to a committee elected by Parliament for research, and then submitted to Parliament for a decision. It is expected that the government will reject this motion because it will delay the submission of this plan to the Council of the League of Nations. (Reuters Telegram, 21st, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[London] Hussein al-Husseini, chairman of the Arab Higher Committee of Palestine, recently led a delegation of Arab nationals to Britain. He met with many members of the British Parliament today and declared that the Arab Higher Committee resolutely opposes the plan to divide Palestine into a Jewish state, an Arab state, and a British mandated territory (according to the British Royal Commission's proposal), believing that this plan contradicts Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations regarding the mandated system and contradicts the declarations made by the British government in the past. Moreover, according to this plan, the most fertile land in Palestine should belong to the Jewish state, so it is by no means acceptable to the Arab people.

<h3>Yugoslavia's Political and Religious Disputes</h3>
<p>Greek Orthodox Christians Demonstrate, Clashing with the Military</p>
<p>[Paris] Serious disturbances occurred in the capital of Yugoslavia yesterday.

Yugoslavia and the Holy See have concluded a religious treaty (in April 1935). The Yugoslav House of Representatives began discussing it yesterday, intending to approve it. Greek Orthodox Christians in the country believe that this religious treaty would give the Catholic Church an advantage, which contradicts the constitutional provision that all religions are equal, so they have come out to oppose it.

<h3>Twenty-Ninth Army's Resistance Arouses Enthusiasm in Northeast</h3>
<p>Volunteer Armies Seize the Opportunity to Respond; Japanese Army Implements Strict Control</p>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since the Japanese army's attack on Lugouqiao sparked the Twenty-Ninth Army's valiant resistance, the news spread to major cities in the Northeast, causing immense shock and a strong desire to recover lost territory as soon as possible to liberate more than 30 million compatriots from their suffering. Now that the sorghum in the Northeast is gradually maturing, the volunteer armies have seized this opportunity to become highly active. Even the puppet troops previously monitored by the Japanese army are attempting to defect. The patriotic fervor in the Northeast has reached its peak. The Japanese Kwantung Army, aware of this situation, has implemented new measures in the South Defense Area (close to North China's puppet Jinzhou Province, puppet Fengtian Province, and puppet Andong Province): ⑴ The puppet Jinzhou was newly incorporated into the South Defense Area. ⑵ In the puppet Jinzhou Province of the South Defense Area, and in Jinzhou, as well as Shenyang, Fushun, Xinmin, Liaozhong, Liaoyang, Benxi, Shuangcheng, Yingjiang, Fuxian (all above in puppet Fengtian Province), Fengcheng, Andong, Xiuyan, and Zhuanghe (all above in puppet Andong Province), air defense orders have been issued. ⑶ In the third category of areas, starting from July 13th, heightened vigilance, control, and security measures have been implemented.</p>
<p>In the puppet Xinjing (Changchun), air defense drills have been conducted continuously in recent days. On the 17th, the actual conditions of the lights-out drills were broadcast from airplanes to various parts of the Northeast. A one-hour trial run was conducted in the air on the afternoon of the 15th, and the conditions of the lights-out drill were broadcast to various regions. The Japanese army claimed that while Harbin had previously held such large-scale exercises, this was the first attempt for puppet Xinjing (Changchun). The duration and various aspects of this exercise were as follows: ⑴ Duration: From July 13th to July 17th, for a total of five days. ⑵ Area: Encompassing the entire puppet Xinjing. ⑶ Implementation methods: (A) Continuous implementation of heightened vigilance throughout the exercise period. (B) Periodic implementation of emergency control measures during the exercise period. (C) Implementation of drills by the Civil Defense Corps. In addition, the puppet Shenyang Police Department also scheduled a meeting for 1 PM on July 15th, gathering all puppet department staff in the conference room on the rear floor to discuss preparations for participating in air defense exercises and precautions regarding counter-espionage.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Strengthens Forces in Chahar North</h3>
<p>Threatening Shanxi and Suiyuan, Protecting Bandits and Puppets, and Securing Rear Area and Protecting Transportation</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: Recently, the Japanese army has been continuously deploying large forces to the Beining Railway line and areas such as Tianjin and Fengtai. They have also amassed troops in the Chahar North region, threatening Shanxi and protecting the growth of bandits and puppets. The following is a brief account of the Japanese army's troop increase in Chahar North.</p>
<p>Reinforcing Chahar North</p>
<p>Zhang Haipeng, the puppet leader of the "Manchukuo" Fifth Military District (Jehol), commands approximately 30,000 troops, mostly cavalry. The quality of the troops is only half from Jehol conscripts. Zhang Haipeng holds only a nominal title, as the key officers at all levels are young Japanese military personnel. Last year, they ventured into Chahar North, colluding with De Wang and other rebels to invade eastern Suiyuan. Recently, to carry out their overall invasion plan, the Japanese army ordered this unit to move west. On the 16th of this month, a cavalry brigade had already been stationed in Zhangbei. According to reliable sources, the cavalry units under Zhang Haipeng ordered to enter Chahar include the 4th, 6th, 8th, and 9th Brigades. Each brigade consists of over 1,800 mounted soldiers, totaling more than 6,000 personnel. The 4th Brigade Commander, Su Mubaolan, led his troops from Jehol to the Guyuan and Daliangdi areas of Chahar North on the 18th. The 6th, 8th, and 9th Brigades are currently concentrated in the Jingpeng County area of western Jehol, awaiting orders to move west.</p>
<p>Allocation of Warplanes</p>
<p>Before the Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese had plans to use a large air force to threaten Suiyuan and Shanxi, protecting the Chahar North rebels. They also intended to deploy a large naval and land force to areas such as Dagu and Qinhuangdao, threatening Hebei and Chahar, and protecting the puppet organization in eastern Hebei. The military actions on the Tianjin-Pingjin (Beijing) road have now become a reality. Recently, in addition to reinforcing troops in Chahar North, there have been reports of a large number of aircraft being allocated to assist the bandits and puppets in Chahar North. It is said that 300 fighter planes will be allocated to support the bandit and puppet armies. As of the 18th, 30 aircraft had already been gathered and stationed at the Dolun Airport, with the remainder stationed in Chengde awaiting orders. As of the 18th, the bandits and puppet forces in Chahar North currently have a total of 49 aircraft, with 30 stationed in Dolun, 12 in Shangdu, and 7 in Jiabusi. In recent days, they have also been flying intermittently to the eastern Suiyuan areas of Bailingmiao, Honggeertu, and other locations for reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Appeasing and Inducing Civilian Armies</p>
<p>Ai Liecheng, the current puppet chief of the Zhangbei County Investigation Office, was originally an officer under Wang Ying. Later, he served as a regimental commander in Yang Shoucheng's brigade, alongside Chang Ziyi. He was then reassigned to his current puppet position. Recently, the Japanese army increased its troops in Chahar North, using the pretext of attacking civilian armies. Since Li Tingfen and Li Ying withdrew, their units were gathered by Zhang Zhongying. However, Zhang is currently on the Suiyuan-Chahar border, and Li's troops are scattered in areas such as the Heihe River in eastern Chahar, making gathering difficult and providing an opportunity for exploitation by bandits and puppets. Therefore, the Japanese have specially allowed Ai Liecheng to appease and recruit the civilian armies, establishing a puppet division to gradually eliminate the civilian armies and use them for their own purposes. However, it is reported that although Ai Liecheng has accepted the puppet order, he has not yet begun to implement it.</p>
<p>Purpose of the Puppet Army</p>
<p>According to a military expert, the purpose of the puppet army's increased defense in Chahar North is not only to threaten Suiyuan and Shanxi but also to serve a specific purpose. This can be understood by examining the current deployment of the bandit and puppet forces in Chahar North. According to the terrain of Chahar North and the deployment of De Wang's and Li Shouxin's units, De Wang's 5th Division is centered in Jiabusi, with detachments stationed in Kangtiao, Baochang, Guyuan, and Dolun, facing Bailingmiao. Li Shouxin's 3rd Division is centered in Zhangbei, with detachments stationed in Shangyi, Shangdu, and Nanhaoqian, confronting eastern Suiyuan, Taolin, Honggeertu, and Xinghe, while also covering the southern defenses of Zhangbei and Chongli. According to the military plan, based on the terrain, Shangdu serves as a support point for operations against Suiyuan, and Dolun serves as a hub for communication and transportation between western Jehol and Chahar North. Zhangbei and Chongli are not considered for the moment, but Guyuan is close to Dushikou in southern Chahar. From a topographical perspective, the hub for their communication and transportation, Dolun, is in danger of being severed by the protrusion from Dushikou. Therefore, the recent increase in troops in Guyuan by the Japanese is aimed at suppressing the civilian armies and threatening Suiyuan and Shanxi, but it is actually to maintain the connection of their transportation routes.

<h3>Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Representatives Petition in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Regarding the Levy of Slaughter Tax, They Urgently Request Withdrawal of the Decision</p>
<p>Nanjing Correspondence: The Shanghai Cattle and Sheep Industry Association, burdened by the Shanghai Municipal Government Finance Bureau's proposed levy of a cattle slaughter tax, sent representatives to Nanjing to petition. Because their first petition was unsuccessful, and because northern cattle are now being purchased and slaughtered on a large scale in Qingdao by certain foreigners for military use, the source of cattle in Shanghai has sharply decreased and market prices have soared, resulting in significant losses for the entire industry. Imposing a slaughter tax would be akin to throwing stones into a well, accelerating their bankruptcy. Therefore, they sent three representatives, including Yang Zhaosheng, to Nanjing for a second petition. At 9 AM on the 19th, they first went to the Executive Yuan, where Secretary Zhang of the Secretariat met with them. According to him, the case has been handed over to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for joint consultation. Yang and others then went to the Ministry of Industry, where Secretary Jin and Section Chief Liu jointly met with them. According to them, the decision rests with the Ministry of Finance and is still under consideration. Finally, they went to the Ministry of Finance, where Clerk Chen of the Third Section met with them. According to him, the case has been jointly submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry for approval. To consider the suffering of merchants, a compromise solution has been determined. After the representatives stated their reasons for the petition, urging the withdrawal of the decision, Clerk Chen replied that a decision would be made after the Executive Yuan's approval. It is said that if their second petition fails to achieve its goal, the representatives will launch a third petition, determined to persist to the end.</p>

<p>The Yisheng, a ship of the British trading company Jardine Matheson, loaded a large batch of flour to Tianjin a few days ago. When the ship was about to sail, it suddenly received an order from the customs to prohibit the export of flour. The ship was required to unload all the flour it carried before it could sail. At that time, the Yisheng ship could not unload the flour because the export period had arrived and it was difficult to unload the goods. The customs immediately detained the customs seal of the ship, and a dispute arose between the two parties. Later, the British Consul came forward to mediate, and the ship was allowed to sail. All the flour in the ship has been guaranteed by the British Consul not to be unloaded in Tianjin. The customs then sent the customs seal to the ship.

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs Stops High Price Hikes in Various Industries</h3>
<p>Rice and Vegetable Prices Have Risen Slightly in Recent Days - Food Arrival and Sales Committee to Meet Today</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, in view of the extraordinary period, in order to prevent merchants from taking the opportunity to raise market prices, has first sent personnel to investigate the rice prices and vegetable market situation in Shanghai, so as to find ways to stop them. The Food Arrival and Sales Committee will convene the [number missing]th meeting today. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Rice and Vegetable Prices Rise Successively</p>
<p>In recent days, the market prices of major food staples used daily in supermarkets have risen successively. The price of rice has risen continuously from last week to yesterday, with an average increase of 70-80 cents to one yuan per load. One reason is that the arrival of inland river rice in Shanghai has been stagnant due to the influence of the current situation. The other is that it is the busy farming season in this summer, so the spot goods in Shanghai are scarce. Secondly, such as the roadside vegetable market, the prices of all meat and vegetable dishes have also risen slightly.</p>
<p>Bureau of Social Affairs Stops High Price Hikes</p>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, fearing that unscrupulous merchants will take advantage of the tense situation in North China and disregard the increased burden on citizens, took the opportunity to profit. In order to prevent this kind of malpractice and stabilize the order and public sentiment in the rear, it sent personnel to investigate the market price situation in various major aspects, and then determined the price limit standard, which must not be exceeded. It instructed the relevant trade associations to forward the instructions to members and non-member counterparts to comply with and implement them. If any secret price hikes are found, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Food Arrival and Sales Committee Discusses Control</p>
<p>The two trade associations of miscellaneous grains, beans, and rice in this city, in order to cope with extraordinary times, prevent food from being used to aid the enemy, and implement merchants' automatic control, specially organized the Food Arrival and Sales Committee, and appointed Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, and other 13 people as members. The association is scheduled to hold the first preparatory committee meeting at the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association on Minguo Road at 4:00 PM this afternoon, actively investigating the total number of grains arriving in Shanghai and the sales quantity every day, and the exact number of reserves of each firm, in order to discuss control measures and plan all effective matters such as the adjustment of the surplus and deficiency of arrival and sales grains.</p>
<h3>Four Freelance Professional Groups Elected Yesterday</h3>

It is also reported that after the expansion of the war in North China, the remittance business between Shanghai and Pingjin is still maintained as usual and has not been affected.

<h3>The Directorate General of Posts Negotiates with the Japanese Army on the Inspection of Mail</h3>

<h3>China Merchants Group Stopped Operating Qingjin Liners from Yesterday</h3>
<p>Temporarily Suspended Due to the Influence of the Current Situation - Tianjin Wharf Has Been Occupied by Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Group previously organized the opening of Shanghai-Qingdao liners for the convenience of all sectors to go to Qingdao to escape the summer heat. The Haiyuan, Haili, and Haizhen, three of the Shanghai-Guangdong line ships, were operating in rotation. Since the opening on the 9th of this month, the passengers have been extremely crowded. However, recently, since the Lugouqiao Incident, Qingdao has been affected by its close proximity, so there is no lack of influence in terms of public security. Therefore, people in Shanghai are worried and hesitate to move forward, resulting in the Shanghai-Qingdao ships of the bureau having few passengers and reduced operating money. The bureau has now decided to temporarily suspend operations from yesterday, and will resume operations when the situation improves in the future. It is also learned that the Tianjin Zizhulin Wharf and warehouse of the bureau have now been occupied by Japanese soldiers, so there is no place for ships to berth in Tianjin. Therefore, the shipping of ships to Beiyang has also been suspended from yesterday, only to Yantai and Weihaiwei.</p>

<h3>New Hurricane to Hit the East China Sea</h3>
<p>The Wind Direction is More Than a Thousand Miles from This Port - The East China Sea May Be Attacked</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reported that the newly rising hurricane on Guagui Island in the Pacific Ocean has turned from west-northwest to north-northwest. It has now advanced to the northeast of Luzon Island, about 1,100 nautical miles from Shanghai. If the direction does not change, the seas off Minxia may be attacked. However, it is still far from Shanghai, and it is difficult to predict whether the wind direction will change. The weather in this port was still hot yesterday, causing a sharp increase in the number of patients.

<h3>Water Level Rises in the Middle Reaches of the Yangtze River, Yichang Water Level Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Highest Record in Nearly 30 Years - The Flood Season Is Approaching, and the Rise Is Serious</p>

<h3>Teacher Rings the Complaint Bell to Accuse the Bailiff of Fraud</h3>
<p>Once Introduced a Person as the Bailiff's Deputy - After Receiving a Deposit of 50 Yuan, He Was Not Hired</p>
<p>Li Yingzong, a new bailiff of the Shanghai Local Court, used to be a clerk of the Shanghai Local Court. He passed the bailiff examination of the High Court this time and was assigned to the Shanghai Court. Yesterday morning, Zhang Chuzhen, a teacher who lived at No. 6 Huaidefang, Humin South Road (ie Coal Ash Road), in front of the Local Court, went to the court's inspection office to ring the complaint bell to accuse Li Yingzong of fraud. It is said that after taking office as a bailiff, he introduced Zai Hengkuan as the bailiff's deputy to serve summonses. On the 11th of this month, when the bailiff was not on duty, he first made an appointment, and Li took away 50 yuan for the guarantee deposit, and signed and stamped it in his own handwriting on the 13th and issued a receipt. Unexpectedly, after Li took office, he did not hire Zai Hengkuan, nor did he return the guarantee deposit, causing me to be in an intermediary position and suffer a lot. Therefore, he went to the police to report the case. Later, he was brought in by the bailiff, and the prosecutor questioned him.</p>
<h3>More Than Forty Silk Factories Unable to Operate</h3>
<p>Depleted Silkworm Cocoons and Export Ban from Production Areas Lead to Factory Shutdowns, Threatening Workers' Livelihoods</p>
<p>The silk factory industry in this city previously suffered losses due to labor unrest. Fortunately, the Party and government agencies handled the situation appropriately, and both labor and management showed mutual understanding, allowing the turbulent labor disputes to pass peacefully. Now, due to a lack of raw materials, not only are factories facing losses, but the livelihoods of workers are also at stake. The Shanghai Silk Factory Industry Association has received reports from members such as Yifeng, Hetai, Yuanchang, Qinyi, Meifeng, Qiaoyuan, and others, stating that this year's silkworm cocoon harvest in the interior is poor, and the raw material inventory of each factory is low. Therefore, they sent personnel to silkworm cocoon production areas such as Zhejiang Province and Wuxi to purchase dried cocoons in order to maintain operations. Recently, these personnel returned to Shanghai and reported that the Zhejiang and Wuxi Silkworm Cocoon Control Committees stated that since the new cocoons came on the market this year, unscrupulous merchants have been smuggling raw materials abroad under the guise of fellow traders. Therefore, they strictly prohibited exports, so even though the factories had already completed their purchases, they could not be transported to Shanghai due to the local export ban. Even after the industry association sent letters of certification confirming that they were legitimate silk merchants, it was still ineffective. Currently, the raw materials of more than forty silk factories in Shanghai are about to be exhausted, and they are about to shut down. All 30,000-plus silk workers are bound to be in dire straits. After receiving the report, the association is urgently planning to discuss appropriate measures to maintain the operations of the forty-odd silk factories and the livelihoods of tens of thousands of workers.</p>

<h3>The Young Owner of Youning Auto Shop Admits to Kidnapping Xue Jiasheng</h3>
<p>Master Ren Sentenced to Life Imprisonment by Special Court No. 1 Requests Transfer to Detention Center Due to Wearing Winter Clothes</p>
<p>Xue Jiasheng, son of the late wealthy paint merchant Xue Baorun, lived with his concubine, Miss Xiaohei, at No. 5, Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. On the afternoon of August 1st last year, at 4:00 PM, Xue was kidnapped by armed bandits who broke into his home while he was taking a nap. He was hidden at No. 72, Juji Road, and later moved to No. 222, Zhishi Road. The kidnappers demanded a large ransom from his family. On the 14th of the same month, French Concession detectives obtained clues to the hideout through a phone call and dispatched detectives to search separately. The kidnappers panicked and fled, and the hostage was rescued and returned home at the same time. Subsequently, the French Concession police arrested accomplices, including Bu Mingqing, Chen Jintang, and Wu Genyou, all from Anhui Province, and handed them over to Special Court No. 2 for prosecution. Bu was sentenced to life imprisonment, Chen to 15 years, and Wu to 12 years. The bandits appealed to the High Court No. 3, but the appeal was rejected. However, the bandits confessed that their accomplices were Chen Huanzhang, also known as Master Ren Ren Wenhai, also known as Xiao Chen, the young owner of Youning Auto Shop at the intersection of Xizang Road and Shantou Road. Currently, the Public Concession Police, due to the robbery case at the Jiangsu Bank branch on Xinzha Road, dispatched detectives to Tianchang County, Anhui Province, and arrested Master Ren and Liu Bingkun. They were brought to Shanghai and interrogated by Special Court No. 1, which sentenced Ren to life imprisonment and declared Liu innocent. The French Concession Police took Ren and Liu into custody and handed them over to Special Court No. 2 for interrogation and investigation. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday at noon, the head of the Criminal Division of Special Court No. 2, Liao, attended a continued hearing in Criminal Court No. 1. According to the prosecutor Fei Xizhen of the Police Department, it was found that the first defendant, Ren Wenhai, participated in the kidnapping of Xue Jiasheng, using weapons to carry out the kidnapping and guard the hostage. The second defendant, Liu Bingkun, was responsible for driving the car and transporting the hostage to the bandit's den. They are now prosecuting the defendants under Articles 347 and 187 of the Criminal Law. Subsequently, detective Tao Ronglin reported on the progress of the case. When questioned, Ren Wenhai admitted to participating in the kidnapping. "I have already been sentenced to life imprisonment in Special Court No. 1. I was brought here, and all the confessions have been made clear by Bu Mingqing, Chen Jintang, and others. I also fully admit it and request lenient judgment. However, it is hot now, and I was arrested three months ago and am still wearing winter clothes. I request to be transferred to the detention center," he said. When Liu Bingkun was questioned, he denied participating in the kidnapping and said that he did not know Bu Mingqing, Chen Jintang, and others and could be confronted. The court adjourned the hearing due to the late hour and announced that it would be rescheduled for 8:00 AM on the 31st to verify and question after reviewing the case files. The defendants were returned to the police station.</p>

<h3>Abandoned Child in a Small Inn</h3>
<p>Two Female Guests Leave Together and Never Return Baby's Birth Date and Time Tied to Its Body</p>
<p>At the Fuxing Small Inn at No. 717, Rue Pellerin, French Concession, at around 10:00 PM the night before last, two female guests from Jiangbei, one holding a baby, came to check in. The two women claimed to be Jin Xiaomei, 20 years old, and Wang, 30 years old. The tea server led them upstairs, opened a room, paid the room fee, and then closed the door to sleep. Not long after, the two women went out together, claiming to be going to eat snacks, and left the baby in the room, sleeping on the bed. The tea server and others did not pay much attention to it. Unexpectedly, the two women were gone for a long time and never returned. The baby cried incessantly in the room. The tea server entered the room to check and saw a red paper tightly tied to the baby's body, on which was written the baby girl's birth date and time, indicating she was only two months old. On the back was written that her mother came to Shanghai from Jiangbei to visit relatives but was unsuccessful and had no choice but to abandon the baby, hoping that benevolent people would adopt her. The innkeeper reported it to the nearby police, who took the baby to the police station and transferred her to Guangci Hospital for temporary care. Meanwhile, detectives were dispatched to investigate. Yesterday morning, the police sent the baby to Criminal Court No. 8 of Special Court No. 2, requesting a decision. After the police prosecutor Chen Ming explained the situation, Judge Zhang Minsheng questioned the investigating detective. A woman named Wu Li expressed her desire to adopt the baby. The court stated that adoption guarantees and other procedures must be prepared. The court decided to send the baby to the Yucai Nursery of the Charity Organization and ordered her to be sent by bailiffs after the court adjourned, with a written document.</p>

<p>At 6:10 PM on the 17th of this month, Chinese police officer No. 993 of the Hongkou Police Station, while patrolling at the intersection of Zhapu Road and Wuchang Road, suddenly discovered a man lying on the roadside. He summoned an ambulance to the scene and rushed him to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Detectives went to investigate and learned that the man's name was Xu Akang, 55 years old. However, his place of residence could not be determined because he was unable to speak. When he fell to the ground, he was still holding tailoring tools and several feet of cloth, so it was presumed that he might be a tailor. He died at 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, despite medical efforts. The body was taken to the coroner's office on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Zhang, appointed by Special Court No. 1, visited the office and determined that the death was due to illness.

<h3>Foreign Robbers Commit Robbery in Jewelry Store</h3>
<p>Directed by a Female Robbery Expert Owner and Messenger Bound and Robbed</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that a shocking robbery case committed by foreigners occurred in this port yesterday (20th) at 1:00 PM. By late at night, no one had been apprehended, but several suspects had been detained, and the police are investigating. According to a detective investigating the case, the victim was the jewelry store set up by the German Mr. Mendelssohn at No. 1163, Jing'an Temple Road. While Mr. Mendelssohn was having lunch alone in the back of the store, two foreigners suddenly arrived, both dressed in white, wearing sunglasses, and each holding a pistol, forcing Mr. Mendelssohn into the repair room behind the store, tying him to a chair, and stuffing his mouth with a cloth. Then, the two robbers proceeded to rob the store. At that time, a foreign woman arrived. According to Mr. Mendelssohn, the woman must be an expert, because she would point out the most valuable ornaments and order the two robbers to take them. The stolen goods were worth approximately six thousand to ten thousand yuan. While the two robbers were robbing the store, two Chinese arrived to deliver a letter and were also driven into the repair room and tied with ropes. According to Mr. Mendelssohn, the two robbers were likely Russians. By the time the police arrived, the robbers had already fled far away.</p>
<h3>Young Chaozhou Girl Zheng Xihua Loses Divorce Lawsuit and Files Appeal</h3>
<p>She Only Discovers After Marriage That Her Husband Is Deaf, Mute, and Young Appeals That the Case's Jurisdiction Is Not Wrong</p>
<p>Zheng Xihua, a young girl from Chaozhou, is currently 20 years old. At the age of 18, her parents were persuaded by matchmakers to marry her to Chen Huanzhen, the underage son of Chen Zhihou, a Shanghai-Guangdong merchant who lives at No. 8, Yong'an Lane, College Road, in the city, and owns the Yonghe Pawnshop and Guangchang Department Store on Yong'an Street, with assets of hundreds of thousands. Only after the marriage did she learn that the groom was a deaf-mute child and was subjected to abuse. Therefore, she hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to petition the local court to annul the illegal marriage and compensate for the losses. Unexpectedly, the court raised the issue of incorrect jurisdiction and overturned the lawsuit, and the local court also ruled in favor of Chen Huanzhen. Therefore, Zheng Xihua specially hired lawyer Yuan to file an appeal. Her statement of appeal roughly stated that the original ruling considered the reason why the defendant's residence was not in Shanghai, based on 1. the testimony of the defendant's father, Chen Zhihou, and 2. the land deeds and agreements he submitted. Chen Zhihou is an important party in this case, and whether his testimony is credible must be judged by comparing it with other proven facts. Moreover, the land deeds and agreements he submitted have nothing to do with where the residence actually is. Furthermore, the first issue that needs to be resolved in this case is whether the defendant has established a residence in Shanghai. The original ruling considered the defendant not yet of age, and that the defendant's residence should be the residence of his legal representative, Chen Zhihou. However, the defendant is already married and should be considered an adult according to the law. Before the marriage is annulled, the marriage must still be considered in effect. The original ruling solely used Chen Zhihou's testimony to determine the location of his residence, which is clearly illegal. Moreover, Chen Zhihou has lived in Shanghai for nearly 20 years, running the Yonghe Pawnshop and Guangchang Department Store. It can be clearly presumed according to the law that his residence has been established in Shanghai. The following facts further prove that the defendant resides in Shanghai: 1. Both parties only returned to their hometown once to hold the wedding. The reason for getting married in Chaozhou was to avoid attention with many relatives and friends in Shanghai, and to trap the appellant in a state of isolation. Even on the day of the wedding, Chen Zhihou still lived in Shanghai and came to Shanghai immediately after the wedding, clearly indicating that he permanently lived in Shanghai and not in Chaozhou. 2. Studying in Shanghai is only a fact after establishing a residence in Shanghai. In the beginning, the defendant did not go to school immediately, which is why he needs to establish a residence first. How can the defendant use this as a defense? 3. The guarantor Chen Zhihou has been in Shanghai for nearly 20 years, which cannot be said to be not long-term residence. His main business income is all in Yonghe Pawnshop, etc. Therefore, the basis of his life is in Shanghai. He has both intention and fact. How can it be said that he does not establish a residence in Shanghai? Before the marriage, the defendant was still a child, also deaf and mute, relying on Chen Zhihou for his residence. It is very clear that he came to live in Shanghai immediately after the marriage and had no intention of renouncing his original residence.</p>
<h3>Maiden Throws Herself into the Black Water Ocean</h3>
<p>Seemingly Due to Marital Problems Details Cannot Be Ascertained</p>
<p>The He Sheng steamship of the Jardine Matheson Company's North China Line set sail from Qingdao at 8:00 AM on the 19th. Two hours after sailing, while passing through the Black Water Ocean, a maiden in the first-class cabin, only 17 years old, wearing a printed white silk cheongsam and leather shoes, walked to the stern of the ship and suddenly jumped into the sea. After the ship discovered this, it stopped and attempted to rescue her, but she had already drifted away without a trace. After arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday, the customs water police station was immediately notified, and detective Wang Haiquan boarded the ship to investigate. It was learned that the deceased's surname was Yang, and she was from Ningbo. This time, she came to Shanghai from Qingdao to return to Ningbo with her mother and sister on the same ship. Although the mother and sister were extremely saddened, they disembarked and left after the ship docked, so the details could not be ascertained. It is only known that the deceased's brother is likely working in the Qinghai Customs. As for the reason for her suicide, it is generally believed to be due to marital problems. It is feared that her mother and sister accompanied her back to her hometown this time to arrange her marriage, and the deceased opposed it to no avail, so she took this drastic measure. It is also unknown. Subsequently, the detective went to the Xinjingtian and Ningxing Shanghai-Ningbo passenger ships in the evening to investigate, but still did not find the deceased's mother and sister and returned.</p>
<h3>A Woman on the Street Encounters the "Honey Trap"</h3>
<p>Forced to Write an IOU after a Severe Beating Two Perpetrators Arrested and Sentenced After Interrogation</p>
<p>Wang Lanbao, a 28-year-old woman from Changzhou, has been cohabiting with Yu Xingen (37 years old) from Zhenjiang. Recently, because Yu did not engage in proper work, resulting in financial difficulties, Wang had no choice but to engage in prostitution to make a living. Wang rented room No. 21 at the Tianyuan Inn at No. 74 Xiamen Road as her residence. At 2:00 AM on the 19th of this month, Wang met Chen Xiaorong, a man from Shaoxing, near the intersection of Nanjing Road and Fujian Road, and immediately seduced him. At that time, they agreed on a fee of ten jiao in legal tender for the night. Then, they went together to Wang's room for a sexual encounter. Unexpectedly, just as they were about to consummate their desires, Yu Xingen suddenly barged into the room with Zhou Fugeng, a man from Suzhou. They first severely beat Chen and then forced Chen to pay 800 yuan as a fee to disengage from Wang. After negotiations, in addition to taking all the legal tender of 1.2 yuan from Chen's pocket, they also forced him to write an IOU for 100 yuan, ordering him to pay it at the Dongshenglou Tea House on Beijing Road the next day before releasing Chen. After Chen suffered this shock, he talked about it with a friend and learned that he had fallen into a "honey trap." He then reported it to the Laozha Police Station. Chinese detectives Sun Dafa and Shan Zhaoxian arrested Wang Jianbao and Zhou Fugeng. Yesterday, the police lawyer Ru Baozhen prosecuted them for extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Law. Chief Judge Qian sentenced Wang and Zhou to six months of imprisonment each. Wang was granted a two-year suspended sentence. At that time, Yu Xingen was on the run. The detectives arrested him on Xiamen Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to Special Court No. 1. After the police lawyer Ru explained the facts, he questioned Yu Xingen, who also confessed without denial. Judge Feng Shide, after verifying the confession, ordered him to be remanded in custody pending further verification of the case files.</p>
<h3>The Robbery Case on Changping Road Involves Multiple Crimes</h3>
<p>The Thief Admits Without Reservation Re-scheduled for Hearing on the 30th</p>
<p>At 9:15 PM the night before last, two robbers armed with weapons broke into the home of Wu Yang, a resident at No. 19, Lane 221, Changping Road, and robbed gold bracelets and rings worth 65 yuan. As they were leaving, they exchanged fire with the security guard at No. 448 in the same lane. As a result, one robber was injured, and another was captured. Two pistols, more than a dozen bullets, and the stolen goods were seized and brought to the police station. It is learned that the injured robber is named Xia Zhensheng, also known as Xia Mengchu, from Anhui. The other robber is named Zhong Zhaozhou, also from Anhui. Yesterday morning, the police only escorted Zhong Zhaozhou to Criminal Court No. 8 of Special Court No. 1. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang prosecuted him for robbery under Article 330 of the Criminal Law and attempted murder under Article 271, and stated the facts of the case, saying that the defendants specialize in robbery for a living and have committed many crimes. The two seized pistols, including a Mauser pistol, were found by the police to be related to the robbery and shooting case on Yidingpan Road on the 4th of last month. He requested a postponement. Wu Debao, the daughter of Wu Yang, testified about the robbery. When questioned, Zhong Zhaozhou confessed to robbing with Xia Zhensheng. Judge Huang ordered the defendant to be detained pending the re-scheduled hearing on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Caoging City Committee Requests a Change in the Location for Establishing Factories</h3>
<p>Yaojing Port North Has No Vacant Land Port South Can Be Used As An Industrial Area</p>
<p>Yang Xinzheng of the Caoging District Committee in the western part of the city, believes that the market in the district is becoming increasingly prosperous. In recent years, manufacturers have been flocking to the district to find land to establish factories. However, after reviewing Article 4, Paragraph 3 of the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Factory Locations in this city, which stipulates that "the area south of Zhaojiabang Xietu Road Humin Road Guohuo Road, east of Humin Road, north of Yaojing Port, and west of the Huangpu River" is the location for establishing factories, according to the then-defined restriction of "north of Yaojing Port," perhaps because there was still much remaining land along the Puxi River, there was no need to expand to the south of Yaojing Port. However, in the current situation, because the city's flying port has expanded from more than 100 acres to more than 1,000 acres, there is almost no vacant land north of Yaojing Port. If factories are to be established, it is necessary to find land south of the port so that they can develop freely. Moreover, the land there is vast and inexpensive, making it easier to purchase, and the Huangpu waterway can be utilized, in line with the late Premier's legacy of maximizing its benefits. It is heard that a weaving factory has recently purchased land south of the port and is about to build, but its progress has been hampered by the regulations of the Provisional Regulations, coupled with restrictions on the horsepower of generators and the number of workers employed. In order to develop local industry and increase production, it is necessary to change the location for establishing factories and re-designate it by including "south of Yaojing Port" into the industrial area. After the committee member detailed the reasons, he submitted them to the city government, asking them to examine the geographical advantages and grant approval.</p>
<h3>Death of Mrs. Huang Fan-zhi</h3>
<p>The mother of Huang Xien, deputy manager of Tianli Gas Plant, and the mother-in-law of Mrs. Niu Tiesheng, Mrs. Huang Fan-zhi, sincerely believed in Christianity throughout her life and was enthusiastic about local public welfare. Unfortunately, she fell ill and passed away at her residence in Shanghai at 9:00 PM on July 21. It is heard that the coffin will be sealed at 2:30 PM on the 24th at the Wanguo Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road, and the funeral will be held at Moore Memorial Church at 3:30 PM. After the service, she will be buried at the Baxianqiao Cemetery. At that time, there will be a grand procession with plain cars and white horses.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Regarding the news article published in your newspaper on the 21st of this month, titled "Eurasia Company's Responsible Representative States That Various Operations Have Not Been Interrupted," which stated, "The Shanghai-Beiping route of China National Aviation Corporation was shortened to Qingdao after the Lugouqiao Incident and has not yet been restored," upon reading it, we could not help but be surprised. The Shanghai-Beiping route of the company, from the outbreak of the incident on the 8th of this month to yesterday (20th), all northbound and southbound flights have been flying as usual every day, and there has been no interruption in flights. What your publication has reported clearly does not match the facts. Please correct it accordingly. Sincerely, China National Aviation Corporation, Editorial Department of Shen Bao.</p>

<h3>It Is "The Last Stand"</h3>
<p>— Mu Chu</p>
<p>The Lugouqiao Incident is not a local incident. Our government has made a clear statement, and it is a well-known fact to the public. However, since the Japanese side used the excuse of a missing soldier to start the conflict, they have been trying to resolve it locally by various illegal means. As a result, the atmosphere of "peace" is hanging by a thread, and Song Zheyuan happened to return the donations from the rear to comfort the 29th Army at this time, citing the "pains of" "The army is supported by the country and is entitled to its due salary. It is the duty of soldiers to resist the enemy and should not receive extra gifts from the people." Although our country is a country that loves peace deeply, a nation that loves peace deeply, the fact that "we are the fish and they are the cleaver" is already so obvious, "their troops enter and exit our country's territory without restriction, while our own national troops are subject to restrictions and cannot be stationed freely within our own territory, or they open fire on Chinese troops, but we cannot return fire." Can an independent country be insulted in this way? Can the people of an independent country be insulted in this way? We can no longer tolerate the "friendship" that Japan has bestowed upon us in recent years. Moreover, "our Northeast Provinces have been lost for six years, followed by the Tanggu Truce. Now the conflict has reached Lugouqiao at the gate of Beiping. If Lugouqiao can be oppressed and forcibly occupied, then Beiping, our capital for 500 years, the center of northern political culture and a military stronghold, will become Shenyang II. If today's Beiping becomes yesterday's Shenyang, today's Hebei and Chahar will also become yesterday's Northeast Provinces. If Beiping can become Shenyang, why can't Nanjing become Beiping? Therefore, the development of the Lugouqiao Incident is related to the entire issue of the Chinese nation." However, the incident that is related to the entire issue of our country, Japan wants to cover up the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand, and lightly take the local incident as a reason to achieve its ambition of gradual encroachment. The rise and fall of the nation is already at "the last juncture," how can we be called to submit without rising up to resist?</p>
<p>Now Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has put forward four very clear points regarding the Lugouqiao Incident: 1. Any solution must not infringe upon China's sovereignty and territorial integrity; 2. The administrative organization of Hebei and Chahar must not be illegally altered in any way; 3. Local officials dispatched by the central government, such as Song Zheyuan, chairman of the Hebei and Chahar Political Affairs Commission, cannot be removed at the request of others; 4. The area currently stationed by the 29th Army cannot be subject to any restrictions. These four points are the minimum limits of our weak country's diplomacy. Is every Chinese national willing to be a "sinner for eternity"?</p>
<p>Now is "the last stand." When the soldiers on the front lines are fighting to the death with the enemy, the people in the rear should "everyone prepare to contribute all their financial resources and materials to the country"; "everyone prepare to listen to the country's requisition and deployment with all their knowledge and skills" is to fulfill the duties of every citizen, to fight for the freedom of the country, and the survival of the nation!</p>
<p>It's "the last stand"! It's "the last stand"!</p>
<h3>WE NEED FACTS</h3>
<p>— Plough</p>
<p>Facts are the best ironclad proof, the best weapon to dispel rumors, and only ironclad facts will convince people.</p>
<p>The Lugou Bridge Incident is clearly a prelude to the enemy's overall seizure of North China. The unreasonable provocation naturally has a purpose and cannot be resolved through genuine peace talks. Because if it is called peace, it should be equal and harmonious. However, since the enemy came to cause trouble, how could they be willing to be "equal" and "harmonious"? At the very least, they want to create an "unequal harmony." And "unequal harmony" clearly indicates our humiliation. Therefore, under the enemy's overall invasion, there is absolutely no possibility of negotiating a "mutually equal and harmonious" outcome. Then, such peace talks are obviously falling into the enemy's trap of delaying tactics and piecemeal defeat!</p>
<p>Fortunately, the brave resistance of the 29th Army restrained the enemy's invasion and aroused the indignation and uprising of the people nationwide! Moreover, General Song Zheyuan, who bears the greatest responsibility for the Hebei-Chahar political affairs, said, "Not afraid of trouble, not seeking trouble, not losing rights, not humiliating the country." Mayor Zhang Zizhong of Tianjin also said, "Zhang will never do anything to betray the people." The 29th Army is also determined to "take Lugou Bridge as its tomb"! Such loyal and heroic cries can make us, as citizens, feel excited! But, while these words are spoken, what is the reality? We are still drilling into the enemy's trap to negotiate! Seeking our own death! Isn't this a great disappointment? As a result, rumors arise, people become uneasy, and everything shows that such facts are not needed, and it also shows that this fact is unsatisfactory to the people!</p>
<p>The fact we need is to fulfill the oath of the 29th Army, to clearly resist the enemy and fight! And definitely not that kind of peace negotiation! However, we cannot help but doubt and worry. What is placed before us are alarming messages such as "400,000 Japanese troops are coming to China," "Japanese troops stationed in Korea have been ordered to deploy," "Japanese soldiers in Fengtai drive into the Ping Municipality," "Japanese troops are still attacking Wanping City, suffering heavy casualties," and even "Japanese aircraft flew to Zhangde at 1:00 PM on the 18th for reconnaissance and strafed the Pinghan Shuangxiang Station with light machine guns at 2:00 PM." Flying freely in our territory is already illegal, and firing at trains is obviously deliberately provoking trouble. The enemy is carrying out their plot to destroy us in this way, but we are still engaged in peace talks of "exchanging apologies"! Ironclad facts only make us anxious and indignant!</p>
<p>Based on the glorious history of the 29th Army, we can trust this oath; it is definitely not an empty promise. We also believe in the government's determination to "rather be a shattered jade than an intact tile," to strike back at the aggressor at the cost of sacrifice! However, the enemy is intensifying wartime preparations, with an endless stream of troops arriving. Yet the senior generals of the 29th Army are still discussing negotiations. Are they practicing their oath? We need resistance against Japan: we welcome resistance against Japan! We are not afraid of death, not afraid of sacrifice, as long as it is a glorious battle!</p>
<p>We unanimously yearn for, yearn for the realization of the facts we need! We should shout loudly: "We need facts!"</p>
<h3>GRASS</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>Old Man Baishou went mad after his eldest son, Wang San, went out to find work in the spring and only his bloated corpse soaked in water returned.</p>
<p>"What is a person? A person is a blade of grass!" Not only him, but everyone, old and young, who lives in the same town and has breathed and survived in this "hellish" atmosphere, feels that there is too little security for human life in a chaotic world. Young people wander, starve, are destroyed and slaughtered in hardship. Then, those thick eyebrows, strong bodies, rough voices, straightforward laughter and screams... all of these, like the shadows of a devil, gradually disappear without a trace. They seem to have gone to a distant world, but in fact, they will never return. Only, in the hearts of those living acquaintances, a bleak shadow remains.</p>
<p>—A person, a person is just a blade of grass!</p>
<p>"People in a chaotic world, people in a chaotic world," Old Man Baishou.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Every day when I wake up from a nightmare, the sky outside the house is already a deep blue color of the morning. The stars twinkle slightly, the fields are swept by intermittent morning winds, and wild dogs along the ridges are constantly barking. Then, the sky slowly brightens, it is morning.</p>
<p>Morning! The riverbank outside the city is again full of people. Old Man Baishou feels a stabbing pain in his head like needles as he walks closer from afar.</p>
<p>'Today, there are three more!' A young man walks down the road in anguish. When he sees Old Man Baishou, he speaks up as if he knows him, but not quite: "Old man, how can you, at your age, bother? You should suffer less. Your son drowned in the river. Can a second one come back to life! Go home and sit down. I'm telling you, there are three today!"</p>
<p>Three! Old Man Baishou walks towards the riverbank in a daze. Downstream, three withered, emaciated, and malnourished corpses sway up and down. Their dark cyan bodies have been stained gray-white by the water, and their swollen faces are adorned with terrifying, resentful eyes—their eyes are wide open, as if in gnashing hatred, they need to constantly look, look, look!</p>
<p>The turbid waves push these captured corpses to the shore. People are all with a kind of fearful, miserable, waiting for the fate that is imminent in the same mood, vying to recognize the faces of the corpses—in these hard years, their own lads and husbands, rushed out so far, years, months... without even a shred of information, perhaps, when they come back, there will be only corpses in the water. For the sake of life, they are trapped in an unpullable mud pit, and are treated as miserably as livestock. "These years, what is a person? A person is a blade of grass! A person..." Everyone has the same feeling as Old Man Baishou. Every day, a few corpses drift by in the turbid river. Some are recognized by their families, who throw themselves into the water, wailing—that sound is almost a roar. In the water, lie the wives' husbands, the children's fathers, and now, inhuman cruelty has caused them to lie in the turbid currents in confusion...</p>
<p>Thus, a group of people naturally stand on the riverbank, fearfully beginning to desperately recognize the faces of those floating corpses from afar, preparing, perhaps when their own men are among them, to throw those rags with them into the turbid, bustling giant pot...</p>
<p>However, the floating corpses have been fished out by the police and are lying wretchedly on the beach. Those watching take a breath, for there is no one they know among these corpses—they are all such unfamiliar faces, they are strangers, from their ceased breathing organs, it seems that they are still constantly emitting the breath of soil from distant villages—aren't their wives and children in distant lands thousands of miles away? Thinking so, a gloomy black mist slowly envelops everyone's mood, "A person dies so easily..."</p>
<p>The corpses are covered with reed mats, lying forlornly by the water. In the river, the turbid current slaps irritably. Only those over middle age lower their heavy heads, silently offering a farewell with the warmth of humanity—</p>
<p>"May the dead ascend to heaven early..."</p>
<p>Morning has come, but it is still gloomy. People know that there will be no sun again today. In the silence, only Old Man Baishou's terrible madness still shouts from far to near—</p>
<p>Did I say it! "In this day and age, a person's life is like a blade of grass! I have lived for seventy years outside the customs, enough... A person is like a blade of grass!"</p>
