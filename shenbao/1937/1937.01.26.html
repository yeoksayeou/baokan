<h3>火綫下的瑪德里</h3>
<p>— 賓符譯</p>
<p>在國際法西斯帝國主義的支持之下，西班牙叛軍圍攻瑪德里，快有兩個多月了。在這兩個多月中，瑪德里的人民每天是在猛烈的砲火下面討生活。傷的傷了，死的死了。年青的正在死力保衛着首都，準備流他們最後的一滴血，老弱的無力地宛轉地呻吟於恐懼和失望之中。這是一幕歷史的悲劇，這是帝國主義奪取殖民地的一次雛形的世界大屠殺。美國名記者路易·斐雪，在戰事最烈的時候，冒了生命的危險跑到瑪德里去，時時給各大雜誌報告圍城中的消息。這篇文字就是斐雪氏最近寄給美國民族周刊的通訊，描述圍城的情形，很是動人，特為摘譯於此，以饗讀者。</p>
<p>最近，瑪德里前綫是沉靜的。沉靜是一個相對的形容詞。每天晚上，當城市中車馬的嘈雜聲停止的時候，我從旅館的窗頭聽着連續不斷的砲聲，以及那像萬馬在大石上奔騰似的銳厲的機關槍聲。不錯，敵人的壓迫多少是鬆弛了。這也許是由於重整旗鼓，也許是等候着後援吧。自然，政府空軍人員英勇的努力，也頗牽制了弗蘭哥將軍的進攻。</p>
<p>有二千到五千的德國兵，帶着他們的軍器已於本星期開抵卡狄茨（Cadix）。據這裏軍界的逆料，弗闌哥得了他們的援助之後，也許就要趁早重行採取攻勢。是的，這確實已經開始了。昨天是星期六，我在街上閒步，忽然發生了一陣巨響，——“彈子！”我自言自語的說。接着又是一陣同樣的巨響，聲音是這樣的堅實而銳厲，不禁使我驚駭起來。我跑進一家時裝店去買些羊毛襪，（瑪德里的所有店舖還屯積着大量的冬令內衣，毛氈和法蘭絨衣，但在四基羅米突之外，那保衛京城的人們却披着薄衣，睡在冰凍的戰壕裏）。有幾個顧客都在討論着這巨響。有一個說：“這是我們的大砲。”但我可不能想像政府為什麼要把大砲放在城市的中心。我回到了街頭。人們都急急忙忙地東張西望地迷惑着。那巨響愈來愈甚了：濃烟在天際飄騰着。弗蘭哥是在轟炸瑪德里的中心了。今天早晨砲轟又行開始，當我寫着時，我聽到數步以外砲彈炸毀房屋的聲音。在這樣環境之下，人們究竟怎樣自持呢？七點鐘我就給砲聲驚醒了。自然，我的旅館也許馬上就要成為砲手的靶子。誰都想跑到安全地帶去，但是誰都恥於逃避的。</p>
<p>弗蘭哥將軍，那反動的西班牙的最高統治者，對於這種進攻無抵抗的人民的戰略，是很有經騐的。他曾從瑪德里的婦孺們獲得了許多次的勝利。空軍對人民住宅的轟炸，已成了日常的事，一個人往往看着他的手錶說：“四點鐘了，他們還沒有到這裏來呢。”我曾經聽到過許多次的空襲，我也曾見過許多空襲的飛機。許曾勘視過炸彈爆發的我多地方。我也曾見過烟霧焚毀中救護的工作。但是經歷了星期五那天的空襲，我敢說，世界上再沒有一件事是這樣的凄慘這樣的罪惡了。正當下午二點鐘之前，我坐在一輛汽車上，我看見人們都在奔跑。街道上立刻跑空了。現在我可以聽到飛機發動機的怒吼聲。忽然來了一陣崩裂，轉瞬之間，一座高山似的烟霧，從下至上整個籠罩住了一所五層樓的建筑物。</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>從經濟上對於日本政潮的觀察</h3>
<p>— 幸</p>
<p>日本廣田內閣因政黨和軍部間的衝突激化。不得不總辭職了。現在宇垣大將雖已受命組閣。但軍部方面反對甚烈。政局前途。還是變幻莫測。這次政潮的癥結。顯然就在軍部方面樹立獨裁政治和施行統制政策的企圖。茲從日本國民經濟方面着眼。把軍部的主張估量一下。</p>
<p>第一據我們觀察。日軍部主張的最大弱點是在國防資源不能獨立。誰都知道日本的资源異常缺乏。無論何種原料都不能自给。因此。雖然日本每年的海運和保險净收入多至一萬七千萬日金。每年的投資净收入多至七千萬日金。但拿這幾項收入來应付它在國外的新的軍事費用。新的投資。以及大量的入超貨價。仍不免發生捉襟見肘的窘状。如果軍備無限制地扩張下去。日本的國際平衡地位當然更加不易維持了。其次就日本與各國的經濟關係說。一九三六年一月到十月日本進出口總額共四十四萬萬日金。其中對美進出口額為十二萬萬日金。對英澳加印共為十萬萬日金。兩者合計達二十二萬萬日金。卽當日本進出口總額的半數。其他英美許多殖民地與日本的貿易關係還未計入。由上面數字。我們可以看到日本對英美的經濟關係。何等重要。日本的統制政策如果完全實現日本國民經濟如果不能自由發展。那麼不但產業金融方面的反響一定很大的。就是日本的對外經濟關係。也不免要受到極大的打擊。第三。近年以來世界民主國家間已產生了一種市塲自由流通的運動。彼此之間漸漸的减除了自由通商的一切障礙。這運動以美國的互惠協定開其端。而英美法三國協定成立以後。推進得更加順利。現在世界各民主國家間的經濟關係一天天的密切起來。反之。施行高度統制政策的國家的經濟却一天天萎縮下去。在這兩大潮流之前。日本的工商階級為了自己的利益。不得不决擇自由市塲主義這條路。</p>
<p>上述三點。可以說明日本政黨這次所以不惜任何代價而與軍部相對立的原因。在這樣的條件之下。日本議會政治似乎還不至趨於完全的沒落。萬一日本政局果為軍部勢力所絕對控制。那不但是日本的絕大危機。對於遠東大局。當然也是要有可怕的影響的。</p>
<h3>日本政局混沌宇垣組閣遇難關</h3>
<p>軍部反對空氣濃厚　拒絕推薦陸相候選</p>
<p>［東京］揆諸今日情勢、軍部對宇垣組閣之反對、仍極強烈、宇垣於完成其緩和種種衝突之初步努力後、始於午後四時往訪寺內、告以本人組閣之原則及將來政策、希望軍部推荐陸相候選人物、聞寺內未作確定之答復、宇垣旋復往訪永野、傳達同樣意向、永野亦未表示意見、盛傳軍部已堅確决定不推荐任何陸相候選人物、設宇垣向軍事領袖作此申請、彼等將以私人資格予以拒絕、此種態度已引起各方之批評、謂軍部違反皇室特權、關於此點、軍部已於今日午後發表聲明、認為極無絲毫違反皇室特權之意向、並謂軍部之不參加宇垣內閣、係恐有碍軍部之內部管理云、惟若干方面則謂軍部方面雖有濃厚之反對空氣、致造成宇垣終必失敗之印象、但觀於一般情勢、最後妥協之途仍通、而組閣之舉亦僅需經過相當時間耳、此種觀察、係以下列見解為根據、卽處目前環境之下、極無較宇垣更為適當之人物、宇垣苟告失敗、將招致更形糾紛之情勢、同時才幹老練而經騐豐富之宇垣、現仍鎮靜審愼進行組閣工作、自信必能獲得成功也、極右派組織今日已連合積極攻擊宇垣、此為極可注意之現象、（二十五日中央社電）</p>
<p>［東京］宇垣大將本日自晨起留於四谷本邸、考慮組閣對策、而一方面陸軍絕對反對、亦自今晨起愈趨强硬、且極力運動阻止宇垣大將之組閣、二十五日午后宇垣與陸海軍大臣會見、在形勢上亦無任何進展模樣、陸軍則堅持旣定之强硬方針、致力到底、是以宇垣之組閣恐將流產、因現正逢絕大難關也、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］組閣工作自二十五日午後首向軍部開始交涉、但關於閣員之人選、因鑒於時局自應處以眞重、今夜尚未開始具體交涉、茲據組閣本部發表情形謂“今晚擬不辦理交涉事宜”云云、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>軍部反對所持理由</h3>
<p>［東京］日陸軍省昨晚召開首腦部緊要會議决定反對宇垣組織新閣、其所根據之理由、為宇垣旣認肅軍為必要、則宇垣組閣後、而一方仍必實行其肅軍計劃、恐事態將較前更為危亟、再者宇垣隸屬維持現狀派、對現局之認識與陸軍逈然不同、則宇垣內閣將妨礙軍部之內部統制云、僉認軍部若果堅持此種態度、宇垣組織新閣之前途、將益多嚴重困難也、（二十五日中央社電）</p>
<h3>組閣方針尊重憲政</h3>
<p>［東京］宇垣大將擬與今井田政德及其二三腹心愼重協議、着手組閣、據宇垣之接近者談、其組閣方針與政策大體如次、</p>
<p>㊀新內閣當然尊重議會政治、然旣存政黨多有應要改革之點、故議會必須實行解散、㊁當銓衡閣員為斷庶行政一新起見、先决定閣員六七人、暫時兼任他省大臣、而於總選舉行補任其一部、㊂陸海軍當局提出其從來主張作為條件時、容認其全部、㊃不由政黨採用閣員、如由政黨採用閣員時、尊重人材、並應以個人資格入閣、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>宇垣組閣各方均表好感</h3>
<p>政黨財界一致擁護　輿論希望愼遴閣員</p>
<p>［東京］宇垣內閣如能實現、政友民政兩黨不論其黨員入閣與否、將必共同援助新閣、議會解散之理由亦於是消滅、解散或可避免、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］民政黨對於宇垣大將之出馬、表示同情、該黨幹部中從來不少宇垣派之人物、且黨內意見、多希望宇垣出馬、但當其組閣時是否要求政黨之協力、尚有疑問、宇垣大將若能本於立憲政治本義、立脚全國民之總意、克服時患、則並不久對其組閣、（二十六日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］宇垣一成自拜受組閣大命後、日本各方均表示好感、民政黨對宇垣之積極擁護、及政友會表示善意而持中立之態度似已確定、貴族院亦認宇垣為繼任首相之最適宜人物、財界方面對宇垣亦表歡迎、深信宇垣足以緩和各反對陣營之衝突、並使日政制之右傾延遲實現、今晨各報對此經騐豐富之大將亦莫不表示贊助、深信宇垣出任首相最為適宜、無人堪與倫比、朝日新聞社評謂目前所憂慮者僅為一部份軍人之反對、但實行肅軍後、在役軍人卽不得干政、故宇垣拜受皇命後、當不致更遭敵手、而陸軍方面似亦不致拒絕推薦陸相繼任人選云、日日新聞表示希望、宇垣內閣首先掃除瀰漫政界之陰霾、再進而澄清政治、務使能表現人民之一般願望云、讀賣新聞則謂宇垣內閣不若廣田內閣能審愼遴選閣員、蓋宇垣之僚屬及有關方面太多、恐須經過不少困難、始能選得光明幹練之閣員、希望宇垣對於此點特別加以注意云、報知新聞社評謂宇垣於物色閣員時、將表示其政治之目光及其對現局認識之程度、故必具有斷然之决心、及審愼之考慮、而關於遴選陸相海相外相藏相四席人選尤須注意、蓋與日本國際關係及人民生活之穩定、有極端重要之關係也云、中外商業新聞社評謂宇垣雖係軍人出身、但與陸軍省缺乏和諧關係、苟有任何危險、其癥結卽在於此云、（二十五日中央社電）</p>
<h3>新閣員人選推測</h3>
<p>［東京］宇垣大將拜受組閣大命後、卽於二十五日晨着手組閣、據一般觀察、宇垣大將任朝鮮總督時、為其政務總監援助宇垣施政之今井田津德任遞相或拓相、然今井田聲稱不願入閣、外務大臣一職、前駐法大使佐藤尚武與前駐華公使駐德大使小幡酉吉呼聲甚高、然尚有一說起用松井石根大將或松岡洋右、以打開外交僵局、據其他一說首相兼任外相、內務大任大約吉田茂或堀切善次郎就任、結城豐大郎之入閣殆已確實、但為藏相或高相未能預測、至於軍部大臣、因陸軍以强硬態度反對宇垣、其人選甚為一般所注目、現敎育總監杉山之大將·朝鮮軍司令官小磯中將·近衛師團長香月中將·關東軍參謀長板垣中將等、頗可注意、前軍事參議官末次海軍大將就任海相之說最有力、司法省內希望林法相留任、政黨方面之入閣者、有中島久平·鳩山一郎·櫻內幸雄·永井柳太郎、貴族院方面樺山愛輔等、又當組閣之際、為將來實施省之合併或廢除起見、一人兼任二相或三相、亦未可知、前警保局長松本學·北海道長官池田清·機務局長安井誠一郎等、可就書記官長·法制局長官·警視總監等職、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>海軍靜觀</h3>
<p>［東京］海軍當局　對於宇垣奉命組閣、取靜觀態度、據海軍意見、繼任內閣之首腦人如能克服現下難局安定政局、而有强力統制力、則不論其為任何方面之人物、當可支持、關於宇垣大將因未聞其打開時局之方策信念及認識等、故擬暫靜觀事局之推移、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>財界焦慮</h3>
<p>［東京］財界對於宇垣大將之組閣工作、至為注意、認為內閣流產當屬最惡之事態、倘繼續難產、則軍部之各項條件或可容納、現亦正在考盧新內閣弱化認為難免、頗堪𣏌憂、惟以各方面毫無活躍氣象、故希望宇垣內閣迅速誕生、以便安定政情、而使經濟界恢復常態、此項聲浪極形普遍、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>右翼團體勸宇垣辭組閣</h3>
<p>［東京］右翼團體之時局協議會、二十五日午後三時召集發起人大會於本部、入江種樹·建川美次及其他諸人均出席·决議如左、</p>
<p>陸軍出身之宇垣、應通曉軍部之現狀、但此次不顧一切、居然出而組閣、當認為不妥、須勸其辭退大命、是所至盼、</p>
<p>上項决議案卽擬面交宇垣、又愛國勞動同志會亦於今晨召集全國四十五支部舉行大會、業已發出指令、並將絕對反對宇垣內閣及勸其辭退大命、一致决議復致電組閣本部、表明大會决議之情形矣、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>議會休會</h3>
<p>至新閣成立為止</p>
<p>［東京］衆院大會二十五日午後一時舉行、承開會劈頭惹起軒然大波、卒使內閣總辭職之後、故政民兩黨及各派議員均以緊張之色而就議席、閣員席空無一人、富田議長起稱、二十五日接到廣告內閣總辭職之通告及請停會至新內閣成立時止之申請、詢諸議塲、田淵豐吉起而反對、其他二三議員和之、議長不以為意、認為無異議通過、一時十分宣告散會、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<p>［東京］貴院於今晨十一時開會、近衛議長提議現因廣田內閣辭職、繼任內閣尚未成立、暫時休會、得全體同意、卽時散會、（二十五日同盟電）</p>
<h3>美官塲不置批評</h3>
<p>惟器重宇垣為人　謂有政治家風度</p>
<p>［華盛頓］此間官塲方面對於日本政潮、拒絕批評、因恐美國政府、將有干預日本內政之嫌、惟悉受命組閣之宇垣大將、美國官方對於其個人頗為器重、認為有政治家之風度、且能隨機應變、故其所取政策、能寬猛相濟云（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>須磨返抵神戶</h3>

<h3>白倫總理演說引起德國反響</h3>
<p>和平不可分割原則　認為不足解决歐局</p>
<p>［柏林］法國白倫總理所發表之演說、其在德國政界最初所產生之反響、大概如下、萊翁白倫曾稱、法國不欲向德國作額似討價還價之提議一層、德國政界均認為滿意、白倫復稱、“法國不欲利用德國經濟情形之嚴重、作為一種手段、而施德國以政治壓迫”云云、此在德國人士尤為愜意、惟政界人士謂、“萊翁白倫就各項重大政治問題所表示之態度、殊不能使吾人苟同、蓋萊翁白倫一方面反對訂結雙方公約、而另一方面則宣稱、法國願始終忠於各友邦、此兩者實互相牴觸、要之、‘不可分割之和平’、並非唯一有效之方案、而濫用國際集體制度之原則者、並非他國而恰為法國之友邦、此等友邦對於德國並無相輿成立諒解之意、今法國乃以欵項貸之、俾用以擴張軍備、殊足惋惜、抑德國對於他國有否良善意志、實不能無所疑慮、德國所由以自力獲得自由權與軍備平等權利者、亦無非不欲仰承他國之鼻息而巳、”此外政界人士復謂、“德國與他國所訂之雙方約束、均能使雙方獲得滿意、例如德國與波蘭互不侵犯條約（一九三四年一月二十六日所訂立為期十年）德國與奧國協定（一九三六年七月十一日所訂立）。英德兩國海軍協定（一九三五年六月十八日所訂立）。以及德意兩國之諒解、均有助於歐洲問題之解决、反之、法俄兩國所訂互助公約則實為歐洲之眞正危險”云、綜觀政界人士之意見、對於法國總理之演說、雖取保留態度、然仍堅稱、德國志在與他國合作、對於白倫表示準備與德國進行剴切之談話、認為殊可欣幸、但以為過去所用方式、不宜重予採用、否則卽有循環盤旋不得途徑之苦矣、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］今日德國官方某批評者　對於法總哩白倫氏昨在里昂之演說、內稱“歐洲之和平關鍵、端在德國”云云、發表談話、謂白氏演辭中涉及德國之處、措辭均極友善、並無抨擊之語、該批評者對於白倫氏信任希特勒氏屢次發表之和平宣言、係具有誠意一點、頗表滿意、據稱、德國不能承認不分裂的和平之需求、為安全之唯一有效方法、並認世之濫行利用集體安全制度者、皆屬法國之友人及協約國、德國合作之志願初無限制、白倫氏今旣宣言、法方已準備與德國作澈底之討論、實為將來之一佳兆也云、白氏昨日之演說、頗出各報預料之外、白氏曾否認有對德國作驚人之新經濟的籲請之意、白氏宣稱、今日之人民陣綫已日趨强盛、且較往日更有生氣、並已證明一種平靜無事之政府、確有防護其國家利益及安全之能力、白氏重行聲明對於兩國間之協定表示反對、並堅持不分裂的和平之原則、關於歐洲時局如能獲和平之解决、各國或可予德以經濟援助之建議、白氏雖亦贊成、惟反對向德提出任何事項之類於交易者、白氏又稱一般人以為德國之經濟問題、或有一日强迫其向外國乞求援助、並肯屈服於各種條件之概念、實屬虛幻而極危險、在另一方面、須知一種經濟的協定、决不能脫離政治之解决而獨立、法國頗願與人合作、如德國亦表示有合作之志願者、則注國已準備與之共同工作矣、白氏結論云、限制及縮减軍備公約、固為解决整個歐局之必要部份、惟今日之軍火製造業、已在國家工業中佔如此重要地位、如欲單純命令停止製造軍火、而不引起嚴重之國內恐慌者、恐不可能也、今日欲實現一種縮减軍備公約而不附以補充的經濟協定、或不可能云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法報紙評論一斑</h3>
<p>［倫敦］各報“對於法總理白倫昨日在里昂城所發表之演說、均感深刻印象、并謂以明白忠實之態度、說明法國所處立塲、此卽演詞動人之處、且白倫所說明之立塲”與英外相艾登前於本月十九日發表演說時所闡明者完全一致、此層尤足慶幸、今後當由德國表明其立塲矣、新聞紀事報載稱、“白倫所發演說、堪補艾登外相演說之不足、其所提議旣非向德國討價還價、尤非用以賄賂該國、要知任何一國凡抱有疑念、以為設在經濟上援助鄰邦、此鄰邦或卽利用此項援助以攻擊該國者、揆諸情理、自不願貿然援助鄰邦、以自貽後患也、法國茲所要求於德國者、不在放棄其合理的要求、而在屏棄其武裝孤立之政策、此種政策對於該國、固毫無利益可言也、”工黨機關每日民聲報載稱“白倫總理說明並無討價遠價之意、以免意志高傲感覺敏銳之民族發生誤會、實屬賢明可取、此外、若干人士對於德國元首希特勒屢次鄭重宣佈之和平意志表示懷疑、此在白倫總理並未苟同、亦其明哲之處、一言以蔽之、白倫此項演說、足當坦白公允之稱”云（廿五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］各報對於白倫總理日昨於里昂城所發表之演說、除右派巴黎𢌞聲報而外、均皆熱烈表示歡迎、并謂、總理所闡明之理論、實乃無可訾議、中央派共和報載稱、“總理表示不願與德國商訂雙方協定、此在德國各報必將指責法國外交政策、謂其受共產黨之影響、實則不然、法國政府固未為莫斯科政府所操縱也”、右派斐伽羅報載稱、“白倫總理昨日所言、實乃法國眞正民意所在、”右派人民之友報載稱、總理所提各項主張、在理論上可謂盡善盡美、“第不知他日能否付諸實施耳、”溫和派秩序報載稱、“總理關於外交政策、尤其是關於法德兩國關係所發表之宣言、確係根據政治上現實情形而發、”社會黨人民報與共產黨人道報則就總理演詞在內政上所可發生之影響、加以評論、人民報載稱、“人民陣綫之組織顯將益臻强固、”人道報則用“人民陣綫今日團結之堅固、實前此所未有”一語、作為標題、該報並登載外交記者“現在日內瓦”發來消息稱、“就吾人所知、此項演詞已在國際方面獲得好評、此固理所當然者也、”僅右派巴黎𢌞聲報之論調則與各報不同、其言曰、“國內國外聆悉總理演詞之後、均當為之感覺失望”云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>禁志願兵赴西建議意德提出覆文</h3>
<p>措辭內容大致相同</p>
<p>［羅馬］關於禁止志願兵赴西投効一事、意政府頃於本日午前十一時以復文一件、送達英國大使館、內稱、關於禁止招募與派遣志願兵前往西班牙國一事、意國政府準備採取各項適當措置、但以其他各國接受同樣辦法為條件、并謂意國政府前已提出要求、主張西國境內各國志願兵務當悉數撤退、至關於該國海陸邊境監察辦法、意國政府所抱見解、當於他日提出之、此外、不干涉辦法調整委員會意國代表刻正草擬詳細計劃、俾將西國境內各政治煽動家設法予以撤退、而使不干涉政策完整無缺、特西班牙伐倫西亞政府、倘令外國志願兵改變國籍、以規避該政府對於不干涉政策所負擔之義務、則意國政府當提出保留案云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］德政府答覆英政府之牒文、措詞幾與意覆文全同、允於其他列强禁止志願兵赴西班牙時、亦作同樣行動、並建議撤退所有參加西班牙內戰之外人、政治煽動份子亦在其列、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<p>前任駐英大使蘇柯爾尼考夫供稱、彼犯有陰謀勾結德日兩國、企圖顚覆俄國之罪、因彼等“失敗派”之信念、以為德國之法西斯主義必將德俄國陷於絕境、彼以為與其將來完全毀滅、不如及早退出社會主義、而與法西斯黨人結合云、檢察官遂質問蘇氏曰德國一旦佔領烏克蘭、尚能容忍爾等之政府乎、蘇氏答稱、彼等將依賴其他資本主義國以阻德國之深進、後由新聞報駐華盛頓訪員羅姆氏供稱、渠曾資特羅資基之函送達拉狄克氏云、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<h3>證券</h3>
<p>公債開新紀錄</p>
<p>補空與加碼並起　行市竟無一不漲</p>
<p>昨日華商證券交易所公債市塲、為一月份期貨最後一塲、驟起猛烈之軋空現象、並不因時局而减色、浮空抵補及掉期、愈為踴躍、而多方大戶、續有大批加碼、市價竟逐步昂騰、統一各債近期、俱已超達高峯、計戊種為六十四元九角半、丙種為六十五元一角、乙種係六十八元五角、均現上市以來之新紀錄、今日祇拍二月份期貨一個月、因人心之堅俏、債市頗有沸騰之勢、而呈畸形變態也、昨日上午開盤、因散戶浮空均起抵補、四十五號吸收頗湧、趨勢甚見堅挺一致上漲五分至一角半、次盤行市續見昂升、戊種為空頭掉期踴躍、近期猛漲四角半、而丁甲等亦因收買者擁擠、均好起一二角、下午開盤、戊種近期、十一號突有巨數實貨傾售、市價驟跌四角、惟丙乙等買氣仍濃、四·七十七號等均在收購、一律再漲五分至三角、收盤此空愈熾、十·五十·三十五號掉期甚湧、十六·七十一號等頗多買進、戊乙等復昂五分至三角、里種竟漲五角半、而各債遠期更形堅俏、全日結果、戊丙等上騰二角至六角、甲乙種則好七八角至一元一角、成交總數計一千五百十九萬五千元、茲將其漲跌高低比較、列表如左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>粗紗銷路忽動多頭準備收貨</p>
<p>末盤抬至二百五十三元</p>
<p>紗市趨堅、本月為最後一幕、多空兩方皆有相當的敵力、據云交貨五千包、然多頭方面掃數接受、且有超過之說、故後市始跌繼漲、但現紗南部粵滇兩帮採辦尤勤、且十支粗紗占多數、同業中購辦期紗、保護標紗空額、內地帮搜羅期貨尤切、因此午後市盤良好、人心挺秀、本月末盤價為二百五十三元、比上月價跌十元云、</p>
<p>標紗各月又轉高翔</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、本月期為最後一日、多方把持二月不放、聞現貨十支粗紗售價激漲一·二元不等、空方將交貨籌碼收轉、檯面轉緊、浮戶紛紛抵補、市盤獨挺、但遠期以現紗銷場未見十分暢達、且大阪三品紗傾向下游、多方拉提雖力、結果近月比上日收盤價漲一元至一元九角、遠期漲跌一·至五角、午後開盤、本月份忽軟化、因有十支·二十支紗解進倉庫、共計五千包左右、人氣稍疲、加之三品紗不振、二盤再跌八角、遠期勿動、迨至三收盤、聞廣東雲南內地等帮對於現紗購辦活潑、且多方收貨心思决定、各月一致轉趨高翔、結果各月比上午收盤價漲一·五角至一元、查賣出恒益三千七百五十包、德大八百包、大豐八百包、泰興六百五十包、昶記六百五十包、瑞大九百五十包、仁豐六百五十包、大昌成一千七百五十包、泰昌二千二百五十包、協成二千一百包、益昶六百包、買進俗大一千六百五十包、明德八百五十包、賡豐四千九百五十包、興昌七百五十包、豐泰一千五百五十包、愼記一千一百包、潤康七百包、福康二千二百五十包、信誠一千八百五十包、永大六百五十包、一日間最高低價列左</p>
<p>現紗銷路頓告起色</p>
<p>昨各帮買去期現紗統計四千四百五十五包、售價漲一·二元不等、各帮買額列下、</p>
<p>總結賬紗花亦停市</p>
<p>本市華商紗布交易所茲於二月六日起、市場停止集會、所有各經紀人向交易所收付各欵、自一日起一律用六日期銀行錢莊本票、卽於是日結束、二月十五日開市後、一律仍照常辦理云、</p>
<h3>交貨籌碼充足本月花獨跌四角半</h3>
<p>棉市平靜、氣勢軟弱、蓋以存棉未减、交貨籌碼充盈、致多方失望、同時世界棉業暗澹無勁、人心愈見怠懈、本月末盤價為四十二元一角、比上個月價跌八角、棉市前途、仍不脫徘徊之局、</p>
<p>標花遠月尚平</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因本月交貨充足、加之海外棉市一味下游、大阪三品花跌勢益劇、人心愈挫、但塲中交易殊滯、結果各月比上日收盤價跌一角至二角、午後開盤本月因交貨踴躍、收貨人心思平澹、再跌一角半、遠月尚平凡、一盤以後仍無變化、結果本月比上午收盤價跌二角半、遠月勿動、查賣出大豐一千一百擔、聚興一千一百擔、通記一千一百擔、裕太五千三百擔、合興二千八百擔、森康二千一百擔、長豐四千七百擔、潤康三千二百擔、同和一千一百擔、信誠四千擔、協成一千一百擔、福康一千五百擔、買進吉豐二千六百擔、大孚三千六百擔、愼記三千八百擔、益康一千五百擔、賡豐五千擔、恒德一千擔、昶記一千二百擔、新昶一千擔、源興昌一千五百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉消費活絡</p>
<p>現棉廠胃漸見起色、來源姚花二千○四十二、通花一千二百五十八包</p>
<p>三品紗花一致下降</p>
<p>二十五日大阪電、現紗跌一至三元、十六支扇面二百五十元、跌一元、二十支金魚二百六十九元、跌一元、四十支五星四百十元、不動、四十二支雉子三百九十五元、跌三元、三品期紗跌二元至四元六角、近日為二百五十八元九角、遠月為二百五十二元、期棉跌六角至一元三角、近月為七十五元一角、遠月為七十七元、</p>
<p>上週美棉漲落狹小</p>
<p>據紐約電、棉市上週漲落狹小、新投機興趣有限、蓋一般正待出售押欵棉花詳細情形之發表、廠長吐賣與結價收購之趨向、為週內主要色彩、惟浮多鑒於各市萎疲、紛紛了結、致多戶感覺失望、罷工及歐洲消息順利曾掀起賣風、再日本之限制滙兌亦使人不安、然棉市對壓迫抵抗甚力、故衆信市面頗穩、目前低級貨拋出甚湧、因商人料押欵棉花出售時、競爭將更劇、市價遂鬆軟、然廠家訊問進步、高級花立能付裝者極少、</p>
<p>又據紐約棉花交易所本週統計云、到貨共一○•三○七•○○○包、較上週增一九○•○○○包、較去年同期增二七○•○○○包、</p>
<p>送廠共四•七五五•○○○包、較上週增一八八•○○○包、較去年同期增二九七•○○○包、自八月一日以來美棉出口共三•四一四•○○○包、較上週增一○四•○○○包、較去年同期少六二○•○○○包、計裝至日本八八九•○○○包、中國一九•○○○包、英國七三二•○○○包、德國四四七•○○○包、紐約目下無存底、按紐約上週存底為一•○○○包、去年同期共五五•○○○包、美國存底共四•六八九•○○○包、低於上週九七•○○○包、低於去年同期二一一•○○○包、</p>
<p>世界可見供給共八•四六○•○○○包、較上週少一六•○○○包、多於去年同期一六三•○○○包、美棉佔總數內六•二一四•○○○包、</p>
<p>自八月一日以來、美棉送世界紗廠共七•三四五•○○○包、較上週增三一八•○○○包、較去年同期增八九二•○○○包、（單位千包）</p>
<p>上週印棉隨三品為升降</p>
<p>週初三品銳跌、引起此間多頭了結及期貨商拋售、其後三品反動、賣方不敢再拗、從事抵補、有大量棉花、本擬裝運日本、現因日本統制外滙、暫行停頓、現棉較靜、蘭開夏平庸、各地問訊寥寥、附錄上週統計如下、（單位千包）</p>
<h3>疋頭</h3>
<p>棉布囤貨心思又活</p>
<p>現貨細布收進四五百包</p>
<p>昨布市微堅、蓋海外棉市、雖一致下遊、而標紗花近期市面轉見挺秀、棉布囤戶心思又告活動、本街及內地帮吸收現貨細布•粗布•細斜•昨又成交四五百包、而期貨交易亦復暢達、東棉•伊藤二行開出東疋日華廠吉祥牌上海廠藍日牌青島貨三桃牌細布四百餘包、係二•三•四月份期貨、市盤現期貨每疋俱堅二分半至五分、獨豐田廠跳舞市布八四布市上貨額奇缺、售盤每疋激漲一角之譜、西南路川滇粵桂諸帮進意俱疏、湘帮稍辦白貨細布•細斜•色布•贛鄂皖辦訊亦寂、然北路天津略辦粗布、山東帮進意亦衰、色布市盤不振、綸昌豪俠藍布每疋降價二角、色斜每疋亦跌一•二角、絨呢•直貢•嗶嘰•印花•布疋市盤平平、本廠細布•細斜售價亦轉穩定云、</p>
<p>西貨元直貢暢銷於天津</p>
<p>年來幾乎淘汰進口大减　近日忽然走銷存貨一空</p>
<p>西貨元青直貢呢、自東貨及國貨出品並直貢呢馬掛淘汰後、進口大减、致榮泰安利德記魯麟公益之老牌货、相想打倒、洋行家有改做东洋莊口、或紛紛收歇、向海關調查所得、近二年來西貨元直贡呢进口、較三五年前减少三分之二、不料物極必反、上年農村豐收、商叢復興、呢絨銷路大增、直貢去路驟暢、古舊存底西貨元直貢、刻多相繼售罄、大都均被天津帮所搜去、聞津埠西貨直貢頗旺銷、近日銀根寬裕之津帮、均有函電來申續辦、奈申地存底亦枯、故市氣復振、</p>
<h3>糖市</h3>
<p>海南赤片青均略跌</p>
<p>昨糖市趨勢軟弱、公會劃盤、二四粗砂白現貨小一角、叫二十三元二角、未成、轉口貨以七元六角至七元五角半有成交、比小一角至五分、東白現貨亦小一角、四號J嘜二十三元二角半、八號及九號SH嘜均二十二元八角半、轉口貨無上落、本廠綿白振記一號二十二元二角、餘照退、號貨有廣潮帮開出現貨海南赤百餘包、十四元、比小一二角、北海片青現貨公會劃過數十包、十一元四元、小去二角、下週可出者開十一元二角、成交二百餘包、合組公司汕頭粗白標二十二元八角、中砂白二十元、均未成交、（連日糖市稿子均為地位所限未能刊布、）</p>
<p>去年糖業在平穩中過去</p>
<p>洋糖大受走私之累　國產諸糖一帆風順</p>
<p>二十五年度之糖業、因五六月間、屢有洋糖减稅之謠、故荷粗白•荷赤•東白•東赤•等市價、時現疲態、獲利機會極少、如荷粗白、在一月份中、曾升至二十二元七角外、迨後均為轉跌盤旋之局、最低到過二十一元半、全年最鉅差度為一元二角、東白市勢彷彿以八號白論、一月份最高價為二十二元三角、自二月份起至九月份、均為跌局、最小價為二十一元一角、十•十一•十二•月份略有回好、最高亦僅二十一元四角、八九號荷赤、最高價為十七元、最低價為十五元六角、東赤與之彷彿、前後差度為一元二三角、蓋洋糖局面、完全為白糖在華北走私及减稅之說所籠罩、始終軟弱難振、幸洋糖减稅終未實行、市價雖有疲落、跌度尚小、否則必尚有更鉅之降落焉</p>
<p>洋糖旣如上述、可見業此者不易獲利、原非偶然、其最大原因、當屬日糖走私所致、蓋减稅之說、亦係由此而起、惟全年市價起落不鉅、卽有受損、數亦甚微、且國產潮糖機會極佳、如青糖以黃崗貨為言、一月份最小價曾進十元關、二三四月份均為漲面、最高到十一元、至五月份曾一度回降至九元八角、但六七八九十月份逐步上漲、最高價竟達十四元半、漲度幾達三分之一、其間獲利之厚、可以想見、然各行做法、間有不同、有多進少出者、獲利較厚、隨進隨出者次之、故去年專重國產糖者獲利可操左券、如均益生記等行、均致力於此、成績當必不惡、其他資力雄厚者、如元生•裕豐恒•方萃和等、亦均可獲利、餘如刁青片青綿赤海南赤等、市勢均大同小異、刁青最小價為九元三角、最高價達十三元半、前後差度為四元二角、片青最小價為七元八角、最高價達十元七角、前後差度為二元九角、綿赤最低價為十二三元、最高價達十六元許、前後差度為四元許、海南赤最小價為十元九角、最高價達十四元四角、前後差度為三元半、共間漲落均近三四元、且大都均為漲多跌少之局面、業此者旣佔上風、獲利自不待言、他如雜路白建冰等花色貨、亦均不遜、尚有大部份國產五羊粗白、最高價為二十二元七角、最小為二十一元三角、前後差度達一元四角、本廠綿白、如振記一號最高價為二十一元六角、最小價二十元三角、前後差度達一元三角、均係平穩之局、而五羊粗白、大都隨進隨出為多、絕少風險、縱觀全局、洋糖雖不易獲利、但尚不致多耗、益以國產糖之良機、故去年度之糖業如無走私關係、當此農產豐登之候、必有特殊成績、似可斷言、奈為華北走私、終致市勢當疲、結果洋糖成績减色、然失之東隅、終有桑榆之收、國產青赤糖乃得一帆風順、大獲其利、更查去年度倒賬至微、益徴糖業之穩健、預測大結束時、大部份自必獲利、卽使成績稍遜者、亦不致有受虧之慮、聞陝變時、此路賬欵較多者、頗覺躭心、而最近糖市因嗬囒糖產價迭漲、洋糖市價得以重振、國產潮糖亦以到存軋缺、又值冬銷活動、遂致各糖無一不升、大有氣象蓬勃錦上添花之概、茲將去年底及最近市價列表如下、以資參照、（單位元）</p>
<h3>南北貨</h3>
<p>湘商動辦大批金山枝</p>
<p>廣東所產之金山扁枝、近以湖南銷路復動、連日辦去千餘件、故號盤突轉緊俏、比前漲起二三元、而多數尚未肯卽開、有待至春盤沽善價之意、同時行盤、亦隨升、較高之貨、須售三十七八元、次略减、圓枝亦漲一元之谱、後市續紧、似在意中、</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>標金一漲復又不支</p>
<p>多方仍旧再降二角</p>
<p>金市昨初以海外银市、微降及勿動不等、匯兑升降不一、伦敦生金漲半便士、中央银行掛牌揭曉、英美俱平、關金勿動、標凖金價升為一一五四元、晨開微高、开後初升後降、大戶求供不一、惟現货號家、買胃較濃、一度轉漲、而多方仍有了的、又转盤旋、後市因多方復來脱手、而更疲、掉期貼價昨已降至一元、今將一天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開為一一五二元七角、較上週六微升一角、生源永進至二元九角、元茂永大德成恒餘大豐恒脫售、退為二元六角、慶發永代生源永力購、乃漲到三元、元茂永恒餘仍有供結、午收為一一五二元八角、</p>
<p>後市開盤一一五二元七角、大德成元茂永恒餘均售、收盤退至一一五二元四角、一日間祇有六角起仆、結果續跌二角、</p>
<p>結價則因中央標凖金價掛牌、升為一一五四元、照收盤價言、約撳二元不到、現貨市况平和、同豐恒曾進本牌烚赤一百四十兩、照加十三元、乃銀樓所售、天津貨照加十二元、烚赤賣價十四元、買介十元、有行無市、掉期昨由空方成大之急於貼進、而降為一元、由泰昌祥貼出一百二十六條、元茂永八十四條、洽豐永二十八條、</p>
<p>塲內交易稀少、綜計同泰昌生源永慶發永居於買方、元茂永恒餘大豐恒大德成則有賣出、本月份條子除公單祇剩四十一條、共計多方一家、空方一家、二月份剩二千一百九十一條、共計多方六家、空方十五家、三月份籌碼計五千一百七十三條、共計多頭二十三家、空頭二十家、成交總數、計前市四百二十條、後市一百十九條、</p>
<p>公單昨由空方同豐裕解所一千三百八十六條、同豐恒五百三十九條、鼎康三十五條、多方今日應收者、計福泰亨八百六十八條、春源永三百九十二條、洽豐永二百五十二條、慶發永二百三十八條、生源永二百十條、結價一一四九元、共計一千九百六十條、</p>
<p>外滙出口結欵稍盛</p>
<p>滙市昨以出口稍盛、日行銀根似緊、趨勢稍鬆、晨初以海外電告、倫敦大條、近遠俱縮○六二五、紐約銀市停工、蒙得里遠期銀價均乏變動、倫敦生金漲半便士、英對美縮○六二五、美對法漲三磅音、英對日縮○三一二五、美對英升○六二五、美對法、對日均平、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、美英俱平、關金勿動、滙市晨開、計英美俱平、開後客帮續塞哈爾濱圓、日行則扒而尚平、滙豐掛牌英美俱平、白銀平衡稅小二五、中途徘徊、後以銀行對做、以及掉期、加之日行依然扒結東滙、形勢稍平、午刻亦然、後市銀行互多對做而平、大連帮續典與日滙有關係之滙兌、但遭日行所吸收、結果則與上週六相較、英美兩匯、近遠均平、華商約拋遠期日匯二十餘萬元、大連帮則拋與日滙有關之現貨雜滙約三十餘萬元、今將一天成交錄後、</p>
<p>英滙晨開近期賣價一先令二便士五九三七五、滙豐售予洋行正月份五九三七五、後市東方塞正月份五九三七五、收盤賣價現貨及正月份均為一先令二便士五九三七五、二月份五三一二五、及五六二五對搭、三月份　便士、及五三一二五對搭、進價照加○三一二五、成交約三萬磅、</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>實銷不暢粉麥近疲遠俏</p>
<p>粉昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈先跌繼漲、後復呈近疲遠俏之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好一角零、坎拿大好四分、利物浦跌一便士零、故開價時、以洋麥互有上下、市塲人心、大致不穩、故各月份初價、雖較前週跌一分外、旋則廠方觀望、業外客戶、曾逐步吸收、因此人心已不一致、買氣比較見盛、故各月份遂回好二三四分不等、迨至下午開盤、本月份因距交割祇有一日半、大部分套頭、多數直接向廠方收貨、惟內地廠方、已有四五萬包、預備交割、所以多頭更少廻旋、最低曾跌至八角一分、惟遠期人心、則依然穩固、照此種情形、完全為套頭局面、因本月份與一月份之差度、已達七分半、而二月份與三月份亦達六分、所以後步實銷如再不暢、近期當須先受打擊云、</p>
<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份呈近平遠漲之象、因洋麥報價互有上落、本月份則已交割在邇、廠方因粉銷不暢、無意收貨、故開價時曾一度低至六元零五分、惟旋卽回上、至遠期各月份、因結賬之故、一部分之浮空、多數了結、致買氣較盛、價亦回漲三六七分、迨至下午開盤、本月份之收解已經就緒、出入無幾、價則反好一分、二月份以下、交易已趨冷淡、市呈盤旋、較上午微有一二分上落、觀目下距總結束日近一日、如國外無大變化、亦可平靜過去矣、現麥市面、因近期標凖不振、喊價亦鬆、江北麥開六元一角二三分、惟津浦路一帶曾有裝到、貨品甚佳、亦祇喊六元二角半、祇有二三千包見又云、</p>
<p>粳米囤戶稍有動辦</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、因陰雨連綿、祇共到二十餘號、貨約四千餘石、內薄稻計十三四號、而青島帮包胃續辦二千餘包、故市况乃見稍緊、行情回起五分、厚粳別以本街銷塲平常、無所榮辱、杜洋尖亦乏軒輊、陰變元去路有限、再落角許、</p>

<h3>王寳川的遺蹟</h3>
<p>— 王永濤</p>
<p>“王寳川”一劇，經熊式一君編導後，曾轟動歐美各國，認為王寳川是永遠不朽的中華貞婦，在我國的婦女界，的是光榮了，今略記王寳川的遺蹟，諒為讀者所樂聞罷。</p>
<p>在陝西鳳翔北鄉　附近的荒地上，有一個陳舊的墳墓，建築時，雖甚壯觀，但距今已有千年，故已毀圯得不堪了。那雜草閒花，叢生在曠野泥土上，更把整個墓地蓋住，左右還圍植着很高大的樹木，而所立的石碑，字跡也糢糊得不能瞭然，要是明顯的細察一下，就能隱約地看出“唐貞婦王氏寳川之墓”的字樣，這顯然是伊的葬身之地了。那裏因地處僻壤，田畝曠野，鮮無人跡，只在桃李爭艷的春天裏，有一羣一羣的旅行男女們，來此遊賞，都喜瞻仰遺蹟，更有女子們，浮着伊是貧寒掙扎貞潔女子的深刻印象，都願跪拜叩祭一番，以表同情。</p>
<p>王寳川受苦的寒窰，則在陝西長安城南曲江池鴻溝岸武家坡前，當伊亡故後，在窰左空地，建有紀念堂一所，也因年久失修，破陋不堪。故在去年春季，重建偉大的新紀念堂，在去年十一月初工竣，堂皇富麗，煥然一新。堂中塑着伊的泥像，及其夫薛平貴泥像，擇同月廿一日開光瞻容，遠近善男信女，都以瞻仰為快，擁擠殊甚，把昔日冷僻靜景打破了。</p>
<h3>郵差</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>二十年來，郵差和我的關係，眞是密切得無以復加，所以我對於郵差的好感，眞也是難以形容。我對於送信的郵差的好感，是在求學時代開始的。那時，我是肄業於南京。學校是離市很遠的，所以每天僅有二次郵件的投遞。那時，我是初離家庭的一個小孩子，自然不免的時常懷念着家庭，所以每當郵差給我帶來了一封家信時，我總是愛屋及烏的，對於綠衣使者，有說不出的感激。而更其是在每月的最初幾天中，綠衣使者，常給我帶來着父親和哥哥，寄給我的附有匯票的掛號信。</p>
<p>從學校裏出來之後，困守家園。我的故鄉，是江南一小村，人家不及一百戶，所以我惟一排除煩悶的良伴，便是無遠弗屆的郵差，所給我每天帶來的申報，以及朋友們的鴻雁。最後的一次，是那個老郵差，給我送來的一封，一位父執給我介紹成功了職業的通知信。於是乎我便離開故鄉，而混進了上海來。但是我和郵差先生的關係，從那時起，非但沒有减退，倒反而有更進一步的密接，因為從那時，我便和一位姑娘，發生了友誼。三四年間，由友誼而發生戀愛。在這一個過程中，我們倆由每半月一函，而密至十日一函，一星期一函，而至於三日一函。待到將結婚時，我們是一日一函，有時，竟至一日二函。所以我以為綠衣使者，不只是我的職業介紹者，同時，在無形中，也不啻是我的婚姻介紹人</p>
<p>我和郵差的關係，更未因結婚而結束。一直到現在，我還是靠着郵差的奔波，而連繫着我與故鄉的家庭的一切關係，以及若干散在四方的親戚友好的情誼。從去年起，我轉入服務機關的郵購部，於是我和郵差的關係，是更深了，因為若是有一天，郵差不上門來，我準得整整的沒有事兒可幹了。</p>
<p>社會，是一天一天的進步着。人事，是一天繁雜似一天。雖然火車，汽車，輪船，飛機，電報，電話等交通工具，是那麼的發達，儘足以應付繁雜的人事，推進着社會，然而以“穩，快，價廉”而論，實在還該是推郵差的服務，為首屈一指。由於我的生活的經騐，我覺得我一生所受的恩惠，綠衣使者所給與我的，是我所一世都忘不了的若干項中的一項。</p>
<h3>佘山之遊</h3>
<p>— 英華</p>
<p>自從松江的張先生向我們宣傳了佘山敎堂的雄偉之後，心裏總想去走一趟，上星期六，陽光暖和，天氣也怪明朗的，於是佘山之遊，大家都同意了。</p>
<p>到松江後，租了一輛汽車，行半小時就到了。車子停在一片瓦磚狼籍的廣坪上，四圍是廣漢的田野。</p>
<p>於其說是爬山，那不如說是過高橋，自山門以上就是一條寬闊而平坦的斜坡，兩旁的山樹離得頗遠，而自有一種莊嚴靜寂的氣象，上了這斜坡就是一個公安局的派出所，接着就是石級了，走過幾十步的石級那平坦明朗的舊敎堂就在面前，一個石板的平壇，靠左下去，許多我國的善男信女們，却正恭敬地跪着在祈禱，三個神龕，耶蘇和他的父母們莊嚴地矗立着使人們瞻仰他們的豐神慨嘆他們的仁慈，在聖母的脚下哭倒着一個我國的少婦，她是死了丈夫而訴求聖母恕她罪孽的，這裏我們的菩薩是已經失悼他們的神通和子民們的愛戴了！</p>
<p>再上去，迎面就是耶穌受難像，接着是石刻的耶穌受難序幕，於是山路迤邐而上，每一段路的首尾都有着一個小亭刻着受難的種種經過，上面提着聖經中的一句一直走完了十四個亭子，才到終點，一座偉大樸質的建築物也就呈現在面前，這就是從民國十六年造起的敎堂，也就是法國人費了九年的時日，在我們的國土上苦心孤詣，做出的成績，植下的根基，而想用這一塊塊的白石，來購買中國人的心的。</p>
<p>因為不是做拜禮的時候，所以門是關着的，我們好容易在旁邊的小門中和管門的人交涉好了，才得進去，裏面的氣象確是太靜穆了，中央是一座金光爍爛的神龕，十字架上鮮血淋漓的耶穌在高高的釘着，那情形眞會使信徒們流淚的，裏面的建築是堅固極了，柱子全是一塊塊大石頭拼鑿而成，又光滑又堅韌，據說造這敎堂的工人都是經過訓練的，他們規定每天打一塊石頭不可太快也不可太慢，所以工程也格外的正確，我們在人們做禮拜坐的長凳上休息了一下後，彼此驚嘆着人家的力量，靜悄悄地走了出來，教堂外面的斷垣破壁在夕陽中輝映着，殘留着十幾年前的大雄寳殿的氣概！</p>
<p>下山來已經是下午一時，在車站對面的小茶店吃了帶去的棕子就跟着大羣的遊人，搭三點鐘的公共汽車回到松江城裏！</p>
<h3>新洋港口的女人國</h3>
<p>— 陳效坎</p>
<p>—是一頁有趣的風土史—</p>
<p>—是一張桃色的小新聞—</p>
<p>鹽城雖然是靠黃海邊的一個城池，但是距海尚有兩百十幾里之遙。南面入海的有斗龍港；北面則有新洋港。這兩條港的面積都很遼闊。同時，在中國漁業上很有重要的關係。在九十月之間漁船回來的時光，這數十里浩瀚的海面上，全給漁舟佔得水洩不通了。——在新洋港港口的所在，有一個小小村鎭，土人喚做花船港，也便是著者所要寫的女人國。</p>
<p>這個花船港怎末會喚做“女人國”呢？原因是鹽城到海灘，交通太不方便，止有幾條凸凹不平荊棘沒脛的泥土路，較為平坦可行的石子路，簡直是絕無僅有。同時，黃包車；摩托軍；………可說連影兒都很少見，止有獨輪車（小車）可以乘坐代步。獨輪車的速力，非常之慢，兩百十幾里的長途，事實上一天不能推到，在此人烟稀少的荒野裏，一落了夜，不是要發生絕大的危險嗎？因此一輩家有妻孥的漁民，感覺到往來跋涉的勞苦和不便，多遷至離海近在咫尺的花船港上來築屋居住，起先祇有寥寥三四十戶人家，然而近數年來，已增加上兩千多戶了。並且，這兒一到三月漁汎的光景，每家十歲以上的男子，都得上船南航的，至瀏河；滸浦；吳淞這點地方去捕漁，一直到廢歷九月底十月初纔滿載而回咧。——在此漫長的半年的當中，這花船港的鎭上，只有女人看守門戶，因此就成為一個古怪的女人國了！</p>
<p>在這一個小小的鎭頭上，因為居民都有團結的精神和强健的體魄，所以雖然還沒有公安機關的設立，可是地方却很寗靜，海盜輕易不敢去騷擾他們·而且人人皆肯茹苦含辛，脚踏實地的向生活圈中奮鬥，是以家家戶戶，溫衣飽食，無愁無憂，簡直不知人世間還有憂患的一回事！</p>
<p>這兒雖然沒有一爿較為完善的鋪子，然而在一班娘兒們的繡房裏，却佈置的十分富麗，什麼牙膏呀；香水呀；雪花膏呀；……，也應有盡有的，原來這些著名的化妝品都是伊們的丈夫在南航時買回來的。</p>
<p>花船港上的婦女，個個出落得嫵媚動人，在這半年之間，村鎭上祇有女人守家，因此鹽城一輩無產階級的窮光棍，多放胆上花船港去，直到伊們的丈夫瀕將掉舟回來時，那一點狂蜂洩蝶，這才東飛西散了。</p>
<h3>換巢鸞鳯</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回（素帕寄纏綿奇文鑄錯　黃花對憔悴秋信添愁）</p>
<p>當日仔細盤算了一會，到了次日下午，就檢了一部書，將給夢蘭的信，重新修改了一回，照原樣，讓劉媽帶到李家去。過了兩天，夢蘭根據了這對去信，已有答復，友梅已是把信送到，那是無疑的了。但是友梅自那次誤會以後，始終不曾來過，却是對於兩人的信件依然繼續的傳遞着。光陰容易，幾十天的暑假，一混，就過去了。國器依然到學校裏去敎書，夢蘭也依然到學校裏去讀書，彼此常經過的那一條巷子，現在又復原相遇了。國器在未恢復常態三天以前，心裏頭已經想着，有兩個多月，沒有看到夢蘭，不知道夢蘭是瘦了還是胖了。或者依然不改原樣。而且有了這幾個月的友誼，彼此的情感，格外要進步些，再有見面的機會，一定相處得很好，總可以暢談幾句話了。如此想着，唯有極力盼望那日的來到，以便瞻仰這進步的成績。而好容易熬到了這一日算凖了時間，向這條路上出發。在這種情形之下，也可以說是心心相印，當他走進巷子的這一頭，夢蘭也就走進巷子的那一頭了。國器在前些日子就預備好了，在這次遇到了夢蘭，不必慌忙，先增定了脚，接着取下帽子，最後是－鞠躬。這就笑着說：江女士今年下半年，還是在原來的學堂求學呵！他應答之後，大概不會提到彼此通信的話，可是他一定會贊許自己的文學幾句。那時就笑着答應他，毫無足取，雖然發表的文字不少，僅僅是一種苦工而已。以下的話是不能預測了，只有到那個時候，相機答復。但預備了這些話，把初次見面的儀節，也就完備了。心裏很坦然的，順了巷子向前走着，及至兩人走着可以看到了，國器的心房，就卜卜亂跳，臉皮飛起一陣紅暈，直紅到耳朵後去。脚步越向前走，頭就越向下低。低着只能看到脚前頭兩三尺路。直到兩人只相距三四尺路，自己怯懦的心事，究竟為自己的一種情好之心所戰勝，就停了脚步，向對過的人看了一眼。那夢蘭由遠處走來，步子走的很慢，差不多到彼此衣角可以相接觸的所在，他猛可的站住了脚，兩隻亮晶晶的眼睛，向國器注視着。（一二七）</p>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<h3>無關“外交機密”的往事（上）</h3>
<p>— 張眞相</p>
<p>敵人加緊對付我們之際，除了軍事秘密不容洩漏以外，外交陣容內部的動靜，一個稍有國家觀念，略具民族意識的人，也曉得有許多話不能隨便講出，能勉力做到“緘口若瓶”，當然最好。不過，在旣無關軍事機密，又無關外交機密一個原則下，我們也不妨拉雜講幾件已往的事。</p>
<p>第一，先講外交部政務次長徐叔謨，在十四五年前，尚未入外交界以前的事。大家都曉得徐謨在外交界是由最低的地位，逐漸由北而南，升到司長的地位，再由歐美司長升到現在政務次長的地位。他是恭謹謙和，絲毫沒有官僚氣習的一位現代中國政治人物。講話很漂亮（擅外交詞令却不是油腔滑調。）嫻習很麻煩的外交禮節，一些輕浮的神氣都沒有。原來他是中學校裏一位極好的英文敎師。他對學生沒有脾氣，但是學生總很怕他。時下有些敎員，往往對學生不是一味地敷衍，便是一味地將課程壓緊，壓得學生敢怒不敢言，於是以此得校長的歡心。徐謨對學生却不是如此。他認為學生到學校裏來，旣是求“學問”的，當然問答應對最為緊要。尤其是英語敎學，要練習發音正確，應對如流，每次上課，他總要用英語喊起許多的學生回答他發出的問題。有一次，他的校長（揚州第八中學校長李荃）要想學英文，輕輕地推進他的敎室，坐在學生的最後一排學椅上。徐先生不管校長的來意如何，仍抱着向例依次按照行列一一向後喊起學生回答。因為由每行最前位向最後位喊起学生時，照英语敎學時的惯例，是可以為節省時间便利起見，只说一声“耐克司特”（Next）後面的人聽了便要站起來。那位李校長當時雖坐在最後一排，徐先生却也不將他放鬆過去。李校長身體魁梧，跑到課堂上作學生，正和軍委會副委員長馮煥章走到陸軍大學的課堂裏般一樣令人注意，令人一看就覺着有趣。當李校長被徐先生用英語喊起，他因為英文程度很低，便只好呆若木鷄站了片刻。後來，他便不再到徐先生的課堂裏來了。</p>

<h3>薛香姐經法醫檢騐從未生產子女</h3>
<p>並提出腹部平坦照片為證　庭諭辯論終結定今日宣判</p>

<p>薛香姐仍未到</p>
<p>由郵鄂森•唐愼培•律師代表到庭、先由原告律師稱、今日證人泰安里二房東因在鄉間、故由其子到庭、應請傳訊、庭上認為毋庸訊問、繼由鄂律師提出抗辯、謂原告所訴、全非事實、據其稱根寳係生於民國八年二月乃民國七年十二月初八日被告之弟薛炎生與貝潤生之女結婚時、被告亦</p>
<p>參加攝有照片</p>
<p>而在照上立於被告旁之嫂（卽薛淦生之妻）、則大腹便便、懷有身孕、而淦生之妻產於民八三月、較被告尚遲產一月、依理被告之腹部必較其嫂更大、但就照片上觀察、祇見薛淦生妻之大腹、而被告之腹平坦、焉有懷孕八九月之腹、毫無顯露之理、又被告為使事實眞相明瞭計、曾向鈞院法醫魏立功處檢騐、據其診斷結果、認為</p>
<p>被告從未生產</p>
<p>過、有此種種、適足以證明原告所訴無理由、應請駁回其訴云云、遂將照片及診斷書呈案、而原告律師陳文卽提出答辯、謂當時被告尚未出閣、若腹部隆起、焉敢參加皇皇之婚禮、其理果然、乃腹部隆起實能設法使之不現於外表、故僅憑照片、焉能觀察出是否有孕、再被告所提出之診斷處、係由</p>
<p>鈞院法醫所簽</p>
<p>固無可非議、但被告方面之手續、殊非合法、理應由被告到庭後、由庭上送交法醫鑑定、今祇私人請魏醫師診斷、若往診之人、非被告本人、而以他人頂替、在被告旣無特殊標記、魏醫師何能確定該往診者實屬被告本人、基上理由、被告之抗辯、殊難採證云云、庭上核稟、卽宣告辯論終結、定今日上午九時宣告判决、</p>

<p>地皮二畝</p>
<p>房子一間牛、前由母舅代管三年、現已交我管理、與原告毫無關係、至此、原告稱、我本姓陳、因入贅為填房為張安濤、認作嗣子、並呈出張琴初結婚時之由張咸林出面禮帖簿據合拍照片等證物、但琴初辯謂、禮帖等物係偽造、合拍之照片、乃幼時與我同出遊玩拍的、不能作為證據、一個在庭上堅欲做父、一個極力否認為子、官諭本案候改期傳證再訊、</p>

<h3>中國衛生敎育實施問題（上）</h3>
<p>— 林竟成（講）殷占五（記）</p>
<p>在鎭江農村護士學校學術講演會講</p>
<p>甲·引言</p>
<p>我們曉得，在我國民衆方面的衛生常識，一向就是很缺乏的！因此以致不能實行個人衛生，不知道公共衛生，偶有傳染病發生，亦不知其預防與隔離，而釀成鉅大之死亡率者！此實為我國國民一重大之損失！所以如果要養成民衆的衛生習慣，使民衆取得衛生上的保障，對於凡是衛生當局所有之一切衛生設備，都能去享受與利用，則非得先實施衛生敎育於民衆而不可；實施衛生敎育，可謂救國强種，以求得全個民族健康之根本方策！因此，更可知道在中國的推行敎育，也並不是仿效外人，將外國的方法完全的搬到中國來的，中國社會的組成，生活的程度，經濟的窮困，以及民衆的信仰宗敎與風俗習慣等，完全是與外人異同的；所以在中國的衛生敎育實施，必須按照各地社會情形，而分別擬定方策。總之，以能合乎民衆之信仰而接受，甚至更能去實行才是。</p>
<p>乙·衛生救育應與普通敎育並進</p>
<p>照文盲之統計，我國有百分之八十的民衆是連“大”字都也不認識的；至於少數而能享受到普通敎育的，也均在水平綫之下；所以在這種情况之下，的確我們感到實施衛生敎育，却是很困難的一件事；因為衛生敎育並不是單獨能進行，而必須伴普通敎育而共進的：衛生敎育非普通敎育不能以助進，同時普通敎育中對於衛生敎育一項之列入亦為所必需，非此，事倍功半，均不能得完全之功效！故衛生敎育應與普通敎育並進。</p>
<p>丙·衛生敎育與生產敎育的關係</p>
<p>在這社會不景氣農村破產之下的今日，農民的生活難得一飽，祇須你走進貧民的窟窩去參觀一下：則饑，寒，窮，陋，隨處都可使你感到中國人的生產太可憐、太缺乏生產敎育了！因此往往在我們用衛生的事業去敎導他們，或普施他們的時候，他們首先便感到一種憂愁的狀態！原因是他們並不是不接受衛生的美意，然而他們沒有飯吃！沒有衣穿！沒有屋住！饑寒尚且無着，更何暇以顧及衛生？因此他們所希冀的：B是能有人去代他們解决充飢禦寒的生產敎育，衛生敎育的需要還屬次等。因此我們在實施衛生敎育的時候，對於貧民的生產敎育也必須先行顧及。</p>
<p>雖然也有人這樣的說：說是衛生敎育卽是生產敎育的一部分。原因是：衛生敎育㊀可以减少超格死亡；㊁减少疾病時之消耗；㊂增加生產效率。因此對於貧民的生產上可以帮助不少，但在民衆的意羲，還是在解决當前生計為先决條件。總之，吾人不論其先决或後决，衛生敎育旣為生產敎育之一部分，欲實施衛生敎育，則對於生產敎育亦不可忽視。兩者之關係，實屬重大！</p>
<p>丁·衛生敎育的目標</p>
<p>實施衛生敎育的目標：㊀養成國人之衛生習慣；㊁灌輸國人之衛生智識；㊂改良國人之不良環境；㊃預防國人之疾病發生。然在個人之意見，實施時欲達到上項目標，則對於吾國人日常數種不合理之人生觀，必先行打破！㊀“生死有命”！㊁“眼不見為凈”！㊂“無為主義”；㊃“從古愛舊”。否則，阻碍當前則推行仍屬不易，如此旣可培養國人維護公共衛生的道德觀念，則可對所定之目標，也必能收事半功倍之效！</p>
<p>戊·衛生敎育實施的步驟</p>
<p>衛生敎育實施應首先由學校做起。其優點：㊀因學校為有組織團體，無支側問題發生；㊁遇有疑難問題，可有敎師指導之；㊂小學生腦筋旣很清凈，且知識程度亦較為平衡，所敎當亦較易接受。因此，有這樣幾個優點，較為容易推行；所以衛生敎育須以學校為中心點，為出發點，由學校而推及家庭，更由家庭再推及於社會。</p>
<p>然欲得學校衛生有成績，同時也須顧到社會衛生敎育是否有相當之基礎方可，因學校與社會亦有連帶之關係，是不能互相脫離的。因此在學校所得到的結果，往往也會受到社會及家庭的磨擦力减小的！</p>
<h3>海寗縣醫藥衛生之過去和現在（中）</h3>
<p>— 夏蒼霖</p>
<p>十年來時疫之流行與救治</p>
<p>海寗的時疫。可說是無年沒有。尤其是赤痢白喉傷寒各症。更是隨時發現。近十年來疫癥之大流行凡二。一為十九年之流行性腦脊髓膜炎。一為廿一年的霍亂症。</p>
<p>㊀十九年腦膜炎流行。開始於諸橋。蔓延全縣。下走曾參預防疫。所以知之較詳。當時海寗設防疫會。于城區諸橋酆墅廟硤石袁花。各設一防疫所。諸橋為疫區中心。流行最烈。所以規模也較大。除縣府委派下走主其事外。省垣市立醫院陳南坪院長復派醫師數人到諸襄助。省立傳染病院禇君穀院長，也派員到酆墅廟組織隔離病院。而縣府楊祖炯醫師。責任更為重大。夙夜不眠。奔走各區。衛生署錢建初姚永政醫師。上海衛生試騐所程樹臻所長。浙口衛生試騐所所長羅賽。科長謝漢卿諸氏。均先後到諸橋考查。在工作緊張的時候。各醫師均日夜不眠。從事診療。各防疫所均分設宣傳消毒掩埋注射救護各隊。每日分頭出發。實地工作。結果在六個月中。死的約二千餘人（可是非疫而死均包含在內。）注射總數約三萬餘人。而救治治愈的。也不下千餘人。這次防疫的結果。海軍民衆所得到的敎訓不少。就是鄉下人。也多知道：</p>
<p>一·腦膜炎是很可怕的傳染病！</p>
<p>二·腦膜炎是接觸傳染的！</p>
<p>三·防腦膜炎要帶口罩！</p>
<p>四·防腦膜炎要打預防針！</p>
<p>五·治腦膜炎要抽脊髓液打血清針！</p>
<p>這次的時疫。對於農村直接間接的損失很大。已近破產的農村。受了這次大疫。到現在還不能恢復呃。</p>
<p>㊁二十一年的霍亂流行。海寗全縣的飲水。多靠着市河。一般習俗。淘米提水及洗滌衣褲。多在同一地方。所以胃病向來不時流行。一有霍亂。星星之火。便成燎原了。那時候地方官廳以十九年大疫之後。連年荒蕪。社會不景氣與農村破產之下。根本沒法籌欵來辦防疫。所以除了舉行預防注射外。也沒有辦法。各地醫院雖也在可能範圍內。義務施救。但病者衆多。也難盡量接受。那時候張景貽醫師曾向旅滬士紳募得的欵。在硤石設立臨時時疫醫院。雖為時僅數月。而救治的也屬不少。不過一般人還是相信挑痧匠。因此死亡的總數。離無統計。要亦可觀吧。</p>
<p>烟毒與葉烟</p>
<p>“海寗烟毒製種者絕無。販運者亦少。其吸用則以長安硤石為最盛。因地當輪軌交通。毒品易於輸入。餘如黃灣一帶。為鹽商萃薈之所。其毒况也不亞於長安硤石兩處。所用毒品。純係雅片一種。均由蘇滬一帶偷運而來。沾染者以中下階級為多。近年來因烟禁森嚴。復加蠶桑失敗。社會經濟。陷於破產。烟民無力再吸。自動戒除者。為數甚多。其富庶之家。畏法奔匿上海者。亦復不少。蓋以年來施行厲禁。拏戒兼施。境內毒况。大致已告肅清”——這是引用海寗縣二十四年呈報浙江省特派禁烟委員的報告（見吳望伋氏巡𢌞督禁八縣烟毒報告）——可見嗜毒之輩。見烟如命。祇要禁令稍弛。就難免死灰復燃。所以雖曾數度宣告肅清。而到今監獄裏的烟犯。仍然十分踴擠呢。</p>
<p>海寗縣自十九年一度嚴禁。指定各地醫院辦理戒烟後。二十一年又奉省頒禁烟方案。組織禁烟委員會。設立縣戒烟所暨毒品檢查所。毒氣一時稍殺。後縣立戒烟所無欵續辦。於二十三年一月庭停止。另行指定域區湯俊卿診所硤石生生醫院袁花康民醫院長安福音醫院等。兼理戒烟。嗣後奉令續禁辦法。復籌欵恢復縣立戒烟所及第二三四區戒烟所。並聘請覆騐醫師。加以覆騐。據吳望伋氏之報告至二十四年一月止。已戒烟民為六八三。而海寗烟民的確數。據二十三年八月間的調查（吳望伋氏報告）全縣為一六五七。那麼未戒而吸食的數尚可觀。本年度又再度嚴禁。復設城區及硤石區戒烟所。更指定硤石生生覆恩宏康三醫院。限令登記自動投戒。可是辦法雖好。祇以縣府當局。處理不善。竟發生縣長凟職濫罰自動投戒烟民一萬零四百五十元一案。被人向禁烟總監舉發。遍載日報轟動遠近。結果縣長交保。秘書科員等四人扣押保安處。全案尚未判决。而數年來海寗禁烟史上。遂留着污點。目下各地醫院。均不敢接受戒烟。而烟民亦深以自動投戒。仍有入獄之慮。遂東西遠避。禁烟進行。大受打擊了。</p>
<h3>談癌（四）</h3>
<p>— 小卒</p>
<p>癌腫在臨床上的現象，是硬塊。按之如石。解剖的外象，是硬結。有厄突之面表，情形與普通的瘤腫，沒甚差別，惟有這個多峯的，不平的表面。在臨床上，用為診斷中一個要緊的佐證。初起時，全身毫無感覺，不痛亦不癢，及至逐漸長大，身體隨而消瘦，體重層層下降，皮色轉變呈黝暗色，黃晦失光澤，癌腫所在地局部的潰瘍，與週圍的侵蝕，乃至臟器功</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>能的失効，當然也是可靠的，引起疑心的徵象。至於確切的診斷，則由醫者於可及之處，割下一小塊，送由病理學家切片檢查，爲一定不易之法。生活學方面，則有克來氏反應，KlienKrebsReaKtion　Klein　Krebsrsktion可以做癌腫有無的診斷方法，現在還在試用期中。癌腫最後的結果，是Kachixee即所謂惡液質病。這是使身體消瘦，體重下降，及皮膚變色的主動者。至於癌腫如何造成惡液汁病的理由，現時病理生理家，尚未能予我人以圓滿的答覆，此中理由，當然須在新陳代謝中尋覓了。</p>
<p>癌腫的惡性，是由他迅速的生長，侵蝕的能力，與移轉的作用表明的，他的原因，既至今還未明瞭，也没有一樣對症的好藥，所以醫者遇此時，唯一的辦法，是用刀來割治，别無良法，鐳麽，X光麽，生活學上方法麽，（如細胞自消素等）都只有幾分的把握，最使醫生爲難的，是他的病毒移轉的迅速，Metastiade諸多癌腫策源地區未到不可收拾的地歩，病毒的種子，已由淋已或血管輸送到他方，很快的發芽結果。所以外科家動手之前，先次審愼地檢查移轉程度之深淺與範圍的廣狹，以斷手術之宜否施行，否則茫然從事，將徒使病人受痛苦，而無補於事。正如剿匪，必須通盤籌算，否則顧此失彼，徒然勞民傷財呢！。棘手事之更甚於此者，爲癌好復發，往往初病纔從割去，不久原處又復重生，着實使病者麻煩，醫者受無可解釋的責備。還有一件事，最討厭的，是被病毒移轉感染的地方，起初毫無病象，或不甚顯明，若在此時，病者經過手術治療，似乎宿病一旦霍然，可是好境不常，没有好久，潛伏的病根，又會發條抽芽般生發起來，一波方平，一波又起，真是病家與醫者共同的，難於避免的恨事！在這裏，我們十萬分的希望着，能够有一種可靠的診斷方法，像克來氏的反應，而有百試無爽普遍可以應用的效能！來做臨床家的指南，正是一件功德無量的事情！因爲不單單醫家有許多爲難，即在病人，因此病初起，甚鮮感覺，所以不十分注意，待到潰瘍或其它徵候顯明時，泰半已至不可救藥之境，倘能有這樣一個方法來試騐有無癌腫在身，或得到早期診斷的機會，豈不是大妙嗎？</p>
<h3>撲滅梅毒</h3>
<p>— 孫克錦</p>
<p>梅毒初行於歐洲，約在十五世紀後，（哥倫波發見美洲大陸時）漸及於我國，約在十六世紀前，（葡舟椗泊廣州通商時）今則延及全地球，其原因由不潔交媾而起，夫傳於妻，重卽喪命，母染其子，輕亦弱種，若不撲滅，小則絕嗣，大卽亡國，實為民族中最危最險之症，歐洲各國，深知其害，撲滅梅毒，不遺餘力，普魯士年用於防止傷寒，不過八百萬馬克，而用於撲滅梅毒，年支一千五百萬馬克，歐戰後，漢堡市，男性四分之一，女性十分之一，患有梅毒，政府取締，逐見减少，第一期梅毒，已寥寥無幾，皆歸功於六○六劑，查德京柏林，每百人中患花柳病者，兵士百分之五，學生百分之二十五，商人百分之十六，女侍百分之三十，奧京維也納，花柳病往年頗多，近由政府從事撲滅，業已大收其效，吾國尚無統計，滬市某校行血液檢查，有陽性反應者三十餘人，可見梅毒勢已燎原，市上醫師數百人，平均每處五人就診，患花柳者約有數千之衆，若不防止，卽將蔓延，由家而市，由鄉而村，大有不可收拾之虞，亟應由政府由醫師協力合作，防毒杜患，其要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）宣傳花柳病常識，印刷小冊，分送各處，以期家喻戶曉。</p>
<p>（二）籌設花柳病展覽會，陳列圖畫，以便觸目驚心。</p>
<p>（三）分派醫師至公共塲所，演講花柳病經過及其危險。</p>
<p>（四）各校衛生敎育，增入花柳一科。</p>
<p>（五）醫師將花柳病預防法告知民衆。</p>
<p>（六）患者非經醫師根治全愈，不得任意中止。</p>
<p>（七）患者違章中止醫治，得報告公安局處罰。</p>
<p>（八）患者傳染花柳病於健者應處徒刑。</p>
<p>（九）患者就診，應實告住址，以便調查。</p>
<p>（十）設立免費花柳病院，以愈為度。</p>
<p>（十一）取締私娼。</p>
<p>（十二）檢查公娼。</p>
<p>（十三）男女結婚，須經醫師出健康證明書。</p>
<p>（十四）取締廣告所有花柳藥品，並經醫師二人以上負責證明，不得登報賣藥。</p>
<h3>從冬季進補談到牙齒的保護</h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>國人之言補者多以冬季。蓋以為在春則精神渙散。入夏而暑熱煎逼。至秋則有瘧痢之威脅。惟有冬季。氣候清爽。精神歛聚。食慾旺盛。體能受補。而且食品又不易壞。此時進補。其事易舉。其効易見。故凡感體力不足者。莫不趁此時機。訪醫問藥。以求補益。而補品之種類。亦至繁多。參燕鹿茸。虎骨龜膠。中藥之所尚。肝油肉汗。奶蛋麥精。西醫之所稱。要皆羅山川林野之珍奇。採動植礦物之精粹。特法泡製。加工提鍊。成為丸散膏汁。某也溢陰。某也補陽。某也添精。某也益氣。而又有補腦補肺、補脾補腎等特種製品。滿載報章。充盈藥肆。各從其所信。各擇其所宜。望治於補天之聖汁。期効於再造之神丸。然而服者期望雖殷。而失望者比比皆是。當見友朋中有百般調補。補而無効或愈補愈弱者。細究其故。非人體之不宜補。實補之不得其道也。夫欲言補。必先知虧之所在。補之所由。茍無虧則補為多事。茍有虧則補不宜遲。吾人身體之有虧損。豈限於冬令哉。自幼至老。新陳代謝之進行。無時或止。全身之細胞。時時刻刻。排舊納新。舊者去。卽成虧缺。新者來。卽為補充。一日之中。凡一舉一動。甚至於一呼吸一思想之微。皆足以耗損體力。增加虧缺。吾人旣常處此虧缺狀態之中。必有天然補充之道。其道維何。卽天然之空氣。卽天然之空氣。藉呼吸器官之吸入。與夫天然之食物。藉消化器官之消化吸收。成為滋養料。由血液運輸至全身。以補充細胞之虧缺也。吾人之活動愈甚。則虧缺愈多。而補充之量亦應愈多。茍此吸收之量。不能按時彌補細胞之虧缺。卽新者之來。不能抵舊者之去。則週身細胞。必漸次萎縮。各部機能衰退。身體未有不疲弱也。欲保身體之健康。維持天然之壽命者。必使所吸收之量。常常超於或等於所耗缺之量也。然此吸收之量之增多。胥賴消化機能之健全。而不專在於食量之多寡。食品之優劣。更無需乎特製之補品也。啜糟之夫。力可制半。膏粱之子。手難縛鷄。每見富有之家。其主人日進珍饈補品而常瘦。而其傭仆食祇殘羹剩餚。反而頭肥體胖、肌豐膚潤。再觀乎畜類。反芻之獸。食草而肥。草。纖維質也。鮮有所謂蛋白質脂肪澱粉等滋養成分。然而入於牛羊之胃腸。經消化之靈妙作用。卽成為無上之滋補品。而變為體內之一切骨肉脂脂皮毛次。吾人日常所食之魚肉蔬菜米麥等物。亦猶草之於牛羊。對於人體之需要。一切俱備。若能充分吸收利用之。無一非天然無上之滋補品也。若消化機能薄弱。不能吸收利用。雖至名貴之補品。於身體無益也。食物之消化利用。固有關於胃腸機能之强旺。然實有賴於牙齒之健全。蓋食物第一步之消化。不在胃腸而在於口。食品在口。經牙齒之咀嚼。唾液之混和。唾液中含有能消化米麥類、品之酵素）。已經細爛柔潤。成為半消化狀態。然後胃腸再將此半消化之食物。藉各種分泌液之作用。充分消化之。吸收入血。成為全身細胞之滋養料。其不及消化或不能消化之食物。則排洩於外為糞便。牙齒殘缺不全之人。食物不能充分嚼細。不能得充分之唾液混和。則其在胃腸之消化。必致遲鈍。吸收之量。亦必减少。多半未經利用。卽已排洩。滋補價值。大為遜色。且口部消化旣不完全。胃腸必須加倍工作。日久過勞。每易功能失常。消化更為障礙矣。不寧如是。齒病之人。其蛀牙處之毒菌。或備糟膿瘡症或齒槽膿漏症所滲出之膿汁。與食物混和嚥下。不特可以吸收入血發為各種疾病。且能直接為害胃腸。引起各種胃腸病而妨害消化。是故欲消化機能之健全。食物利用之充分。必先致力於牙齒之保護。吾人應當講究口腔衛生。常請牙醫生檢查指導。以預防齒病。已有齒病者。應早治理。以遏止病機之進行。恢復咀嚼之功能。同時戒除有害胃腸之惡習如烟酒及不規則之飲食等。如是則消化機能必臻强健。食物吸收必趨暢旺。餐餐皆為進補之時。物物皆成滋補之品。補身之道。莫外於是。處茲生活。艱難人事紛繁之社會中。感精神體力之不足者衆矣。體虧固宜求補也。特根本之圖。一方面在於省勞寡慾以節其流。一方面尤宜極力保持天賦消化器官之健全。增加天然食物之吸收。以遽其源。使身體之虧缺。日日有充分之彌補。而體力常充裕矣。若捨本求末。狙於冬季進補之習。乞鑒於藥石。縱能獲益於一季。又烏能補其餘三季之虧缺哉。</p>

<h3>西安事件希望早日解决</h3>
<p>— 天羽</p>
<p>據日前報載，西安事件，雖未絕望，然而希望甚微，眞是一件痛心的事，驚人的西安事變，剛從蔣委員長的安然回京而得告一段落，這半月來了令人窒塞的低壓氣，又籠罩於潼關南北了。在此民族危機日深一日，敵人的陰謀層出而不窮的形勢下，此事若不早一日獲得和平解决，前途是够使人焦慮的。</p>
<p>所可慮者，不是在其他方面，而是民族的敵人，又將乘虛而入了。這話並非無證據的。本報第二卷第二期的每週增刊上登有一篇關於陝變後敵人在華北陰謀策動變亂的報告，（文題是：陝變及於華北的影響），那便是眞相的確實描繪。在該文中，有一節最重要的，說：若陝變再遲幾天解决，恐華北今日又是另一個樣子了。這是多可怕的事實！另一個事實，便是德王的通電停戰。當時蘇聯的報紙，尤明白的指出，那是一種鼓動中國迅速分裂的陰謀。德王停戰，意義是放鬆對東北郎的牽制，暗示的使紛亂集中於西北方面去，待戰事爆發，他那時再長驅而入，收漁人之利。前面所記本報週刊上一文，正是這一個觀察的最好註脚。因此，上次蔣委長的得以安然回京，不僅為蔣委員長個人安全慶幸，正還得為民族而慶幸。誰能說陝變不有上次的解决，華北不會有一個驚人的變故呢？</p>
<p>也因此，對於今日的西北問題，我們就更盼其能早日得以和平解决了。敵人對我的陰謀，是形形式式的。比如，利用我們某一部分的不安，而積極的，直接間接的推進其攪亂的作用，這在他們是一種最毒辣的政策。我們是否讓這陰謀的狼虎，又乘機竄入了我們民族的園地？防止的方法，唯有積極使內部紛亂萬勿擴大。在和平下求統一，緊守藩籬，是為上策。無論站於什麼的立塲之上，今日人民敢說誰都希望不再有一個內部的風波到來的罷。</p>
<p>蔣委員長上次出西安時，第一個的舉措，便是命令軍隊的停止前進。這是舉國所頌贊的。希望蔣委長的精神，還能為此次二度解决西安問題之張本。謹以最大的誠意，祝望此次西安事件能在和平下獲得順利的解决！</p>
<h3>有太陽的屋子</h3>
<p>— 路直</p>
<p>巴基在秋天裏的春天裏，借魔術師巴達查爾的嘴說：“生只是在寓言：夢也只是在寓言。生的路上籠罩着黑雲，夢的路上閃耀着藍空的微笑：生的路上長滿着惡草，夢的路上開着鮮花。……”</p>
<p>我們生着，生着只能夢着。我們的夢展開的有陽光，美麗的春天，但我們的生是黑暗的，充滿了寒夜的惡囂。</p>
<p>連太陽，是的，連太陽都有多少年沒進過我們的房間裏了。</p>
<p>我下了决心，决心住有太陽的房子。這决心實行過一次，我到太陽從早晨吻着眼皮，輕輕在我耳邊說着故事，到我伏在桌上倦了，輕輕的舒口氣的時候，太陽才像一個慈母，伏在窗口，低低的說：安靜些，我要走了。這樣的生活有一個月，祇是一個月，太陽又永遠在我房間裏消失，我的窗門老是灰暗的，冷的，北風的住家。</p>
<p>這一次我又下了决心，租了間有太陽的屋子，這間屋太陽逗留的時間雖然很短，但我總於有太陽射進的屋子。我將這消息遠遠的送給平，告訴他我住了這麼一間屋子，而且希望他來同住，希望他伴着我，在太陽的光耀下，找我們失去的，過去的回憶.也許能够夢—我所夢的太多，怕夢了，但也還想做夢，做一個幸福的微笑的夢。</p>
<p>我知道他會快活的。我們過去伏在北風的窗門下的歲月，使我們的熱情也隨着冷了。而寒冷，饑餓，不幸，這些使人皺眉的事情，又與我們結着緣，不願意捨棄我們這一對朋友，老伏在我們的屋子內。</p>
<p>我後悔着，後悔我讀過那許多講美麗的故事，講美麗的愛情生活的故事，我讀得那麼多，而平他亦讀得那麼多，我們昏昏的走上吹着春天的氣息的戀愛夢中。可是，這些在我們只是夢，雖然有許多人眞實的生活在這夢中，我們只有捨棄這夢，和我們無奈的捨棄了太陽的屋子一樣，分別了。</p>
<p>可是我們又夢了，像一對孩子，也像一對失去記憶的人，忘了那些痛苦，在遙遠的兩地，將兩顆心兒聯起來，聯繫在一個春天的夢裏。</p>
<p>我告訴平，我有了間太陽的屋子。我不再想起太陽的屋子並沒帶來麵包，而平的信中也只是說：“有太陽光的房子！對呀！太陽！我們須要太陽！太陽不是也該有我們的份兒麼？我眞高興，雖然我還沒有看到這太陽光的房子，但我快活哩！我知道這間房子也有我的份兒，太陽光也有我的份兒！呵，我眞快活！春天，太陽，愛情，這些都等着我們！不是麼？我們須要生活在春天裏，太陽光裏，愛情裏！”</p>
<p>讀着他的信，我的心有些抖，這孩子總記不起破殘的夢，那一些黑黑的壓在我們生活過來的路上的殘夢。</p>
<p>巴基敎別人做夢，說着夢中的天堂，可是生活在籠罩黑雲，滿是惡草的路上的人，夢做得長麼？</p>
<p>拾得的孩子不能結合，不會結會，就是結會，不幸也將籠在他們的身上的，讀着平的信，我想起住了這間房子以後，太陽也有好久沒見了！</p>
<h3>龍亭</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>這，在歷史上也曾經留下了一個深的印痕的古城，—開封到現在，是更加沉沒了，沉沒了。</p>
<p>還清楚的記得，那一年，坐在隴海鐵路的列車里，穿過了北地的平原時候，望出去，是沒有邊際的一片枯黃，讓乾了的樹木荒張的逃過去，像一隻船，漫野將是浩大的海洋，逃過去的枯樹，將成為搖擺不定的船舷了。</p>
<p>走進城門，一切都如預感樣的，頹敗的路，頹敗的市房，甚至連寄居在里面的人也都懷藏了頹敗的面色。但是，正相反，我愛上了這古城，同時，愛上了古城裏的一切勝蹟。</p>
<p>不知在那本書裏，曾有記載這古城的“龍亭”的事蹟，事蹟雖已記不清楚，而“龍亭”的名字却還印在腦上。</p>
<p>正在冬暮的天氣，外面不很冷，趁一個大好的晴天，生疏的摸索着，走上龍亭的路。穿過許多錯縱的街道，緊對南門城樓那一條直街的盡端，有那末一道殘缺了的牌坊，由牌坊望去筆直的，路並不怎樣寬，亭子呢？並不如所想像的那樣簡單，牠是巍巍地，矗立在平野里。</p>
<p>兩旁，有兩方大的池塘，一般的都稱牠呌二龍坑，從路沿直伸到遠方，圍成了一個大的圓圈，池塘里，是很少流動的死水，青綠的正結着厚冰，玩皮的小孩子，紛紛地把碎的磚瓦丟到冰層上去。每一方池塘的中央，還有墳墓一方透露在塘面上，傳說靠左面的是“潘仁美”，右面的是北宋的“楊家將，忠奸對立，據說頗有些神蹟的，那末，為什麼墳墓會跑到水的中央呢？我不大清楚，當地的人也說不出，不過，那孤單的樣子，旣不見墓碑，又缺少遊履的憑吊，很會給人以凄涼之感的。</p>
<p>登到龍亭的最高層，在”大雄寳殿”的露臺上，向前望去，面對着殿門的是南城門城樓，城門外，還隱約的看得見失了頂的“繁塔”，東北角上，那富於盛名的“鐵塔”插入雲端，有點斜，像要倒的樣子，站在殿的背後望一下破壞了的“滿城”（註）裏面，沒有房子，荒凈得幾乎不能使人相信還有牠的存在。當暮靄的輕風帶過來殿簷下的鈴聲時候，這雄偉的雕有“龍階”的建筑開始被灰色深深地包圍住了。</p>
<p>後來，朋友告訴我這龍亭是被“趙匡胤”一度御用過的，靠近南門的地方，有一條呌“胭脂河”，水總是紅紅地，那就是趙在出走時洗過臉的所在，後來，他逃進了“五龍宮”的佛像背後的小弄里，躺在小的竹床上流滿了汗。假使你呌住持的和尚燃一根火燭去探看一回，泥塑的身子上有一層油光，那樣子，流傳是由原來的神情雕塑的，然而，因為年久失修，有一部分是已經殘壞了。</p>
<p>註：滿城，從前是寄居滿人的所在，後來，為了戰亂，被毀壞了。</p>
<h3>未西亞姑娘</h3>
<p>— 林娜</p>
<p>被分配來做管棧工作的，只有朱石，大目和我三個人。每天的工作是用鐵鉗打開從舊金山，紐約，倫敦或東京運來的整箱貨物，逐件搬出，分裝在若干角落。或者是從櫃架上，按照着門市部開來的貨單，分裝在幾隻不大不小的木箱，外面加封上鐵條，用紅墨水寫明遞寄的地址和店號。然後，由掛在貨車屁股的長大板推上貨車，整批的從棧房搬走。</p>
<p>當這些工作做完了，我們便享有完全自由的權利。有時大家圍在一條作搭舖用的木板上鬥紙牌，把贏到的錢拿去</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>買酒和點心，有時二等伙計朱石先表示不來這一套，他喜歡像一條甲虫似的躱在有着晦暗燈光的角落，坐在一隻矮板凳上，低着頭，看那些從岀欄上租來的，描寫武俠生活的武俠小説，或者像性史一類淫猥小書。</p>
<p>“咿！伙計你？……”大目就生氣似的掉向來我。</p>
<p>“我也不來！”我摇着頭老實説了，對於鬥紙牌我從來是很少參加的。“我想睡覺！”</p>
<p>“都見你們㡳鬼去！”他生氣地揚揚手，就無聊耐的在房子里走來走去，忽然會像想起了什麽事似的，面孔熌着光，嘴里輕輕的嘘起口笛，跑岀棧房門，在寛廣的天井上走來走去，朝三層樓上一個四方形小窗注意的探視着。這窗里，住着一個未西亞老女巫和她成女兒。他開始尖起嘴巴有節奏的嘯着，於是映在窗玻璃上的人影子，便疾速的熌動着，窗開了，一個黝黑的少女面孔，伸了岀來，兩眼張得很大，嘴角浮着微笑。</p>
<p>大目狂喜的舞動着手，他底口笛停了，用呻吟似的聲調，低低的喃些什麽。自以謂她已經聽到了，可是她却只能皺皺眉，張大了口巴，表示一句也聽不懂。没有辦法，他就作着手勢，她沈靜的看着，一會便哈哈的大笑起來，迅疾的縮進窗門里去，不到三分鐘，扶梯聲就索索的嚮起來，一個十五六歳未西亞姑娘，穿着一條綉花小衫和印花綢長裙，赤足上拖着布拖鞋，像一匹在打谷塲上的麻雀，輕快地從扶梯上跳下，回頭向四周看了看，便疾速的飛進棧房去。大目關好門，像一隻公狗似的跟在她屁股後。</p>
<p>朱石書看不成了，我也只得從舖板上爬起來。</p>
<p>“還是鬥牌吧！”大目抓住朱石，邊得意的呌着，邊伸手到衣袋里去掏十二支牌子。</p>
<p>朱石露岀了莫可奈何的樣子，懶懶的打着呵欠，在我底舖板上坐着，就默默的動手鬥起牌來。未西亞姑娘一言不發的坐在大目旁邊。他一隻手忙着鬥紙牌，一隻手就挽住她細得像馬蜂一樣的腰支。有時會裝着不知不覺，用肘子去觸動她發育過早，隆起的乳頭，她温和的微笑着，把它推開了。</p>
<p>朱石面紅着。他没有好好的集中在他底紙牌上，大目和未西亞姑娘底淫猥動作蠱惑着他，使他燃起了像對性史等類淫書一樣的情熱。他常常暗自在心里想着：天曉得，她没有一個人來這兒和他幽會過我才不相信！於是乎，他底牌打錯了，輸了，憤怒的咬住牙關，霎着眼睛，甚至於常常使氣的把紙牌撕碎。</p>
<p>大目狡猾地從袋子里掏岀錢來數着，用嘲弄的口吻説道：“還是停下吧，看樣子你會把整個家産都輸光的……”</p>
<p>朱石同意了，他們就支岀中間的十分之幾，命令似的遞給我：“到菜仔店去買酒和麵包來……”</p>
<p>這樣，他們就默默的坐着喝酒，啃下酒用的甜麵包。未西亞姑娘，没有喝得好多，可定面却紅着，瞇細着半醉的眼睛，喀喀的笑着，比誰都嚮。有時就提起圍裙，赤着脚，在水門汀地上跳起舞來，或下令似的呌道：</p>
<p>“支那們，現在為什麽不打架呢！”</p>
<p>半斤酒，加上漂亮的未西亞女人底蠱惑，我們底武士，就停下盃子，用醉醺醺的聲調互相咒罵，扭打起來。她悄悄的站過一邊，鼓着掌，邊掄動她圓大的眼睛，溜視棧房四周，看看有没有什麽零件的東西，可以隨便藏到圍裙底下，偷偷的帶走。</p>
<p>當這對武士快活的决鬥停止了，未西亞姑娘也不知道在什麽時候溜走，檢着啓封的貨，就常常發現减少些什麽，但是誰也没敢説岀來。</p>

<p>楊斌奎楊振雄“玉虁龍”元昌（一一二○）上午十一時一刻至正午</p>
<p>開篇“柳毅”</p>
<p>桃花如繡柳如金。張序相邀柳毅行。兩兩有才皆有貌。雙雙同學又同鄉。踏青結伴尋詩句。信步翩翩近海濱。見一個。牧羊女子含愁色。背人羞澀見人驚。衣裝不類尋常女。一種風流妙入神。無聊為問嬌娘子。家世何妨試一云。嬌姿豈像牧羊人。含羞襝袵低低說。細語渾如出谷鶯。阿儂因為家君怒。今日懇求寄一音。頭上犀釵堪作證。江邊大樹可為門。如其引指如其說。果有江邊大樹陰。信手輕輕叩幾聲。那曉此釵乃是犀牛角。頃刻能將海水分。水晶宮殿琉璃座。參見冕冠座上人。皇者嚇然生震怒。旣然如此豈容情。論姻緣不碍冥幽隔。鼉鼓逢逢和樂音。龍宮入贅洞庭前。</p>

<p>中西（一○四○）下午一時至一時三刻</p>
<p>開篇“趙雲”</p>
<p>憶昔常山趙子龍。雙全智勇實英雄。庸庸袁紹無智識。碌碌六孫天數終。漢室衰微天下亂。四方草寇逞英雄。占住許都曹孟德。劉表依然在襄中。海內羣雄都割據。漂流皇叔走西東。風雲際會離重合。良將明君散復逢。扶危主。救困龍。當陽誰敢與交鋒。智取桂陽逢太守。殷勤翠袖捧甌鍾。大義昭然焉肯從。周郎又使美人計。錦囊妙策定三封。深入龍潭虎穴中。吳主假傳國太病。孫夫人誤信轉江東。奪主長江建大功。先主連營七百里。陸遜奇謀燒一空。賴將軍保駕到永安宮。帝病託狐親執手。知遇之恩常存胸。丞相出師初上表。老當益壯作先鋒。力斬韓家五虎將。鬢蕭蕭猶顯舊威風。完體將軍千古少。膽大包身孰與同。至今浩氣貫長虹。</p>
<p>蔣寳初“三笑”</p>
<p>新聲（一三八○）下午七時至八時</p>
<p>開篇“柴進門招天下客”</p>
<p>蝦逢淡水戲蛟龍。虎落平陽與犬同。林冲决配來橫海。柴進招留禮貌恭。這叫做。英雄到處惜英雄。開懷暢飲香醪酒。忽然走入敎頭洪。他是。自謂生平多武藝。不把林冲放眼中。說配軍那有多才略。想來必定藝平庸。林冲是，忍氣低頭來伏小。恐防得罪主人翁。當時怒壇小旋風。说敎頭呀，好漢還須惜好漢。你不可，禮貌毫無太不恭。洪師聽·氣洶洶·欲將本領壓林冲。這正是，螗臂擋車害自躬。</p>

<h3>二十世紀劇社日內公演“賽金花”</h3>
<p>戲劇在上海已經達到最高的潮點，公演的廣告幾乎每天都佔着報紙上很大的地位，有二十世紀劇社者，為海上劇壇中之一個嶄新組織，自月前開始排練夏衍氏原著七幕熱烈歷史悲劇“賽金花”，該劇描寫八國聯軍佔據京師後之亡國慘狀，以及清末昏瞆官僚辱國媚外的醜態，猶其在當今國勢阽危之際，對之更令人起無限感慨，並聞該社現已排練成熟，定於本星期五起，在某大戲院公演，愛好劇藝及關心近代國勢者，必需注意及之。</p>
<h3>漢奸沒有好的收塲</h3>

<p>天理昭彰，漢奸是逃不了最後的裁制的，當蕭正中正準備熱熱烈烈的和李琳結婚，是夜，突然警察進來把他捉去了，因為他的走私勾當，已被發覺，可見漢那是不會有好的收塲的！</p>
<h3>業餘劇人第三次公演“慾魔”批評之一斑</h3>
<p>業餘劇人第三次公演，前日起已在卡爾登舉行，第一個戲是托爾斯太之名著“慾魔”，此劇為歐陽予倩氏改編為中國情調的劇本，到作家新聞界數百人，茲將給予此劇之批評，簡錄於后：</p>
<p>我不懂戲，也只看過三四次中國話劇，但我在這一次受到了感動。我想，這不能只歸於原作者底力量，導演和演員底認眞，可以和我看過的日本的同志們並視而沒有遜色，單說化裝吧，敢於認眞裝成一個老太婆，聽說許多演員就不肯。不過，最後一塲面，我聽到了觀衆的笑聲，使我吃驚不小。做了罪惡的事，只圖掩飾，是中國人的做人之道，不懂懺悔，似亦在意中，但導演所加的噱頭，我想不但不必要，而且是一個失敗，這一點不知能供參考否？（胡風）</p>
<p>“慾魔”的表現我沒有話說，因為外行的人看，果已是達到表現的極致了。我要說的是劇本的意義：它使我們明白了世俗所謂“報應”“神罰”的秘密。如果把所謂神的迷霧撇開，就可以看見并不有神在罰人，而是社會的現實在吃人！（艾思奇）</p>
<p>我所受的感動比以前看戲所受的都大，我覺得演員們底成功，有許多人比以前所達到的要高，比如章曼蘋，魏鶴齡，英茵等人。（聶紺弩）</p>
<p>“慾魔”的成功，向我們保證了話劇的新勝私。（柯　）</p>
<h3>金山施超在“夜半歌聲”中</h3>
<p>對於這個劇本和這次演出，我沒有什麼好說，如果硬要我批評，我只覺得這里所表現的農（以下原槁稿　　莨辯）不是中國底的（夏征農　　看了“慾魔”以後，使我認識了我從不　認識過的現社會中許多典型的人物，至於導演和演技，因為我不懂，不能妄加批評，我只能說：我好像看了一幕眞的故事，并不是在做戲，因為舞台上的人物，他們的動作和言語，都有着眞正的感情。（關露）</p>
<p>暴露現實最有力的是話劇，“慾魔”不僅暴露舊社會的一種黑暗，而且指示出它的因果。（柳乃夫）</p>
<p>內心的愧悔，倫理的逼楨；包身工者之幸運乎，小田主應有之沒落乎？我不把它僅作“慾魔”的表現看。（倪文宙）</p>
<p>當我坐在那兒看時，我覺得自己不是來看戲，好像那兒串演着的，不是演員，而是自己。（林娜）</p>
<p>五幕“慾魔”彷彿五塊照妖鏡把現社會之一角，完全露出來。（錢亦石）</p>
<p>“慾魔”里每一個演員都是成功的，我尤其歡喜魏鶴齡和英茵兩個人，他們是使“慾魔”更精彩，更生動的。（錢台生）</p>
<p>動人的情節，配合着熟練的演出，觀嘆止了。（金則人）</p>

<h3>Yuehan Railway Increases Special Rice Transport Trains</h3>
<p>To Relieve the Rice Shortage in Guangdong Province; Four Measures Have Been Determined</p>
<p>Guangdong Chamber of Commerce Again Requests Exemption from Tax on Imported Rice</p>
<p>[Hankou] The Yuehan Railway Bureau, in accordance with the orders of the Ministry, has increased special trains to transport rice to relieve the rice shortage in Guangdong.

The speech stated that national unity, national unification, national defense consolidation, economic development, and cultural progress are all essential elements that a modern nation should possess and are indispensable for the nation's survival and development. Transportation is closely related to all of these points. Therefore, developing transportation is a key element of building a modern nation. Transportation tools include railways, highways, aviation, shipping, telecommunications, and postal services. In recent years, China's transportation situation has made great progress as a result of active management. For example, there are currently 20,000 kilometers of railways, with 1,700 kilometers built last year alone. There are currently over 128,000 kilometers of highways, and aviation routes have over 13,000 kilometers. In addition, there has been considerable progress in shipping, postal services, and telecommunications. All of this is very gratifying. However, compared with countries in the Americas, we are still far behind. Therefore, if we want national survival and development, we must devote all our efforts to developing transportation in the future and consider it the focus of national economic construction. As for the transportation development plan, the Premier has already given instructions, and we only need to follow them and implement them. (25th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Madrid Under Fire</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bin Fu</p>
<p>With the support of international fascist imperialism, Spanish rebel forces have been besieging Madrid for nearly two months. During these two months, the people of Madrid have been living under intense artillery fire every day. The wounded are wounded, and the dead are dead. The young are fighting to the death to defend the capital, ready to shed their last drop of blood, while the old and weak weakly moan in fear and despair. This is a historical tragedy, a preliminary world massacre of imperialism seizing colonies. The famous American journalist Louis Fischer risked his life to go to Madrid at the height of the war, constantly reporting news from the besieged city to major magazines. This article is a dispatch recently sent by Fischer to the American weekly The Nation, describing the situation in the besieged city. It is very moving and is specially excerpted and translated here for readers.</p>
<p>Recently, the front line in Madrid has been quiet. Quiet is a relative term. Every night, when the noise of traffic in the city stops, I listen from my hotel window to the continuous sound of artillery fire and the sharp sound of machine guns, like ten thousand horses galloping on stone. True, the enemy's pressure has eased somewhat. This may be due to regrouping or waiting for reinforcements. Naturally, the heroic efforts of the government air force have also constrained General Franco's offensive.</p>
<p>Two to five thousand German soldiers, with their weapons, arrived in Cadix this week. According to military estimates here, Franco, after receiving their assistance, may soon launch another offensive. Yes, it has indeed already begun. Yesterday was Saturday, and I was strolling down the street when suddenly there was a loud bang—"A shell!" I said to myself. Then there was another similar loud bang, the sound so solid and sharp that I was shocked. I ran into a fashion store to buy some woolen socks (all the shops in Madrid still have large stocks of winter underwear, felt, and flannel clothing, but four kilometers away, the people defending the capital are wearing thin clothes and sleeping in frozen trenches). Several customers were discussing the loud bang. One said, "This is our artillery." But I couldn't imagine why the government would put artillery in the center of the city. I returned to the street. People were rushing around looking confused. The loud bangs grew louder and louder: thick smoke was billowing in the sky. Franco was bombing the center of Madrid. The shelling started again this morning, and as I write, I can hear the sound of shells destroying houses a few steps away. How do people maintain their composure in such an environment? I was awakened by the sound of artillery at seven o'clock. Naturally, my hotel may soon become a target for the gunners. Everyone wants to run to safety, but everyone is ashamed to flee.</p>
<p>General Franco, the supreme ruler of reactionary Spain, is very experienced in this strategy of attacking defenseless people. He has won many victories over the women and children of Madrid. Air raids on people's homes have become a daily occurrence. A person often looks at his watch and says, "It's four o'clock, they haven't come here yet." I have heard many air raids, and I have seen many air raid planes. I have inspected many places where bombs have exploded. I have also seen rescue work amidst the smoke and fire. But having experienced the air raid on Friday, I dare say that nothing in the world is as miserable and evil as this. Just before two o'clock in the afternoon, I was sitting in a car and I saw people running. The streets were immediately empty. Now I can hear the roar of the plane engines. Suddenly there was a crack, and in an instant, a mountain of smoke enveloped a five-story building from bottom to top.</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>An Economic Observation of the Japanese Political Turmoil</h3>
<p>— Xing</p>
<p>The Hirota Cabinet in Japan was forced to resign due to the intensification of conflicts between political parties and the military. Now, although General Ugaki has been ordered to form a cabinet, the military is strongly opposed. The future of the political situation is still unpredictable. The crux of this political turmoil is clearly the military's attempt to establish a dictatorial government and implement control policies. From the perspective of the Japanese national economy, let's assess the military's claims.</p>
<p>First, in our observation, the biggest weakness of the Japanese military's claims is the lack of independence in national defense resources. Everyone knows that Japan's resources are extremely scarce. No matter what kind of raw material, it cannot be self-sufficient. Therefore, although Japan's net income from shipping and insurance each year is as high as 170 million yen, and its net income from investments each year is as high as 70 million yen, it is still in a difficult situation to use these incomes to cover its new military expenses abroad, new investments, and large trade deficits. If military preparations are expanded without limit, Japan's international balance will certainly be more difficult to maintain. Secondly, in terms of Japan's economic relations with other countries, Japan's total import and export volume from January to October 1936 was 4.4 billion yen. Among them, the import and export volume to the United States was 1.2 billion yen, and the total to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, and India was 1 billion yen. The sum of the two reached 2.2 billion yen, which accounts for half of Japan's total import and export volume. The trade relations between many other British and American colonies and Japan are not included. From the above figures, we can see how important Japan's economic relations with the United Kingdom and the United States are. If Japan's control policies are fully implemented and the Japanese national economy cannot develop freely, then not only will the reaction in the industrial and financial aspects be very large, but Japan's external economic relations will also inevitably be greatly affected. Third, in recent years, a movement of free circulation of markets has emerged among the world's democratic countries. They have gradually reduced all obstacles to free trade between them. This movement was initiated by the United States' reciprocal trade agreements, and has been promoted more smoothly after the establishment of the tripartite agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. Now, the economic relations between the world's democratic countries are becoming closer day by day. On the contrary, the economies of countries that implement highly controlled policies are shrinking day by day. In the face of these two major trends, the Japanese industrial and commercial classes have no choice but to choose the path of free market principles for their own interests.</p>
<p>The above three points can explain why the Japanese political parties this time are willing to oppose the military at any cost. Under such conditions, Japanese parliamentary politics does not seem to be completely declining. In the event that the Japanese political situation is absolutely controlled by the military, it would not only be a major crisis for Japan, but also have a terrible impact on the overall situation in the Far East.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Political Situation is Chaotic, Ugaki's Cabinet Formation Faces Difficulties</h3>
<p>The atmosphere of military opposition is strong, refusing to recommend a candidate for Minister of the Army</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Judging from today's situation, the military's opposition to Ugaki's cabinet formation is still extremely strong. After completing his preliminary efforts to alleviate various conflicts, Ugaki visited Terauchi at 4:00 PM to inform him of the principles and future policies of his cabinet formation, hoping that the military would recommend a candidate for Minister of the Army. It is said that Terauchi did not give a definite answer. Ugaki then visited Nagano to convey the same intention. Nagano also did not express his opinion. It is rumored that the military has firmly decided not to recommend any candidate for Minister of the Army. If Ugaki makes this request to military leaders, they will refuse him in their personal capacity. This attitude has aroused criticism from all sides, saying that the military is violating the imperial prerogative. Regarding this point, the military issued a statement this afternoon, stating that it has absolutely no intention of violating the imperial prerogative, and that the military's non-participation in the Ugaki cabinet is out of fear of hindering the internal management of the military. However, some quarters believe that although there is a strong atmosphere of opposition in the military, which has created the impression that Ugaki will eventually fail, considering the general situation, a path of compromise is still possible, and the cabinet formation will only require a considerable amount of time. This observation is based on the following view: that in the current environment, there is no more suitable person than Ugaki. If Ugaki fails, it will lead to a more chaotic situation. At the same time, Ugaki, who is talented, experienced, and veteran, is still calmly and cautiously carrying out the cabinet formation work, confident that he will be successful. It is a very noteworthy phenomenon that extreme right-wing organizations have united today to actively attack Ugaki. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki stayed at his Yotsuya residence from this morning to consider countermeasures for the cabinet formation, while on the other hand, the army's absolute opposition has become stronger and stronger since this morning, and it is making every effort to prevent General Ugaki from forming a cabinet. This afternoon, Ugaki met with the Minister of the Army and the Minister of the Navy, but there was no sign of any progress in the situation. The army insisted on its established strong policy and worked hard to the end. Therefore, Ugaki's cabinet formation is likely to miscarry, as it is currently facing a major difficulty. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The cabinet formation work began to negotiate with the military for the first time on the afternoon of the 25th. However, regarding the selection of cabinet members, in view of the current situation, it should be handled with caution. Concrete negotiations have not yet begun tonight. According to the information released by the cabinet formation headquarters, "We do not intend to handle negotiation matters tonight." (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reasons for Military Opposition</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Ministry of the Army held an urgent meeting of its leaders last night and decided to oppose Ugaki's formation of a new cabinet. The reasons for this are that Ugaki has already recognized the need for military purification, so after Ugaki forms a cabinet, he will still implement his military purification plan, and the situation may become more critical than before. Furthermore, Ugaki belongs to the status quo faction, and his understanding of the current situation is completely different from that of the army. Therefore, the Ugaki cabinet will hinder the internal control of the military. It is generally believed that if the military insists on this attitude, the future of Ugaki's formation of a new cabinet will be even more serious and difficult. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Cabinet Formation Respects Constitutional Government</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki intends to consult carefully with Imaida Seidoku and two or three of his confidants to start the cabinet formation. According to Ugaki's close associates, his cabinet formation policy is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The new cabinet will of course respect parliamentary politics, but since there are many points in the existing political parties that need to be reformed, the parliament must be dissolved. ㊁ When selecting cabinet members, in order to make a fresh start in administration, six or seven cabinet members will be decided first and temporarily concurrently serve as ministers of other provinces, and a part of them will be re-elected in the general election. ㊂ When the authorities of the Army and Navy put forward their long-standing claims as conditions, all of them will be accepted. ㊃ Cabinet members will not be employed by political parties. If cabinet members are employed by political parties, talent should be respected and they should enter the cabinet in their personal capacity. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>All Parties Express Goodwill to Ugaki's Cabinet Formation</h3>
<p>Political Parties and Business Circles Unanimously Support. Public Opinion Hopes for Careful Selection of Cabinet Members.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] If Ugaki's cabinet can be realized, both the Seiyukai and Minseito parties, regardless of whether their members enter the cabinet or not, will certainly jointly assist the new cabinet. The reason for the dissolution of the parliament will also disappear, and dissolution may be avoided. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Minseito party has expressed sympathy for General Ugaki's candidacy. Many of the party's leaders have always been members of the Ugaki faction, and the party's opinion is that they hope Ugaki will stand for election. However, it is still questionable whether the party will demand cooperation when he forms a cabinet. If General Ugaki can overcome the current troubles based on the true meaning of constitutional politics and the overall will of the people, then it will not be long before he forms a cabinet. (26th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Since Ugaki Kazushige received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, all parties in Japan have expressed goodwill. The Minseito party's active support for Ugaki and the Seiyukai's friendly and neutral attitude seem to have been determined. The House of Peers also recognizes Ugaki as the most suitable person to succeed the Prime Minister. The business community also welcomes Ugaki, believing that Ugaki is sufficient to ease the conflicts of various opposing camps and delay the realization of the rightward shift of the Japanese political system. This morning, all newspapers expressed their support for this experienced general, believing that Ugaki's appointment as Prime Minister is the most appropriate and that no one can compare with him. The Asahi Shimbun's commentary stated that the only concern at present is the opposition of some military personnel, but after the implementation of military purification, active-duty military personnel shall not interfere in politics. Therefore, after Ugaki receives the imperial mandate, he should not be opposed any further, and the army does not seem to refuse to recommend a successor for the Minister of the Army. The Nichinichi Shimbun expressed hope that the Ugaki cabinet will first clear the haze that permeates the political world, and then further clarify politics, so as to express the general wishes of the people. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that the Ugaki cabinet is not as careful as the Hirota cabinet in selecting cabinet members, because Ugaki has too many subordinates and related parties, and it may take a lot of difficulties to select bright and capable cabinet members. It is hoped that Ugaki will pay special attention to this point. The Hochi Shimbun's commentary stated that Ugaki will express his political vision and his degree of understanding of the current situation when selecting cabinet members, so he must have a decisive determination and careful consideration, and special attention must be paid to the selection of the Minister of the Army, the Minister of the Navy, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and the Minister of Finance, as they are extremely important to Japan's international relations and the stability of the people's lives. The Chugai Shogyo Shimbun's commentary stated that although Ugaki is from a military background, he lacks harmonious relations with the Ministry of the Army. If there is any danger, the crux is in this. (25th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Speculation on New Cabinet Members</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] After General Ugaki received the imperial mandate to form a cabinet, he began forming the cabinet on the morning of the 25th. According to general observations, Imaida Tsutoku, who was the Director-General of Political Affairs when General Ugaki was the Governor-General of Korea and assisted Ugaki in implementing his administration, will serve as the Minister of Communications or the Minister of Colonial Affairs. However, Imaida has stated that he is unwilling to join the cabinet. As for the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs, the former ambassador to France, Sato Naotake, and the former envoy to China and ambassador to Germany, Obata Yūkichi, have a high voice. However, there is also a theory of appointing General Matsui Iwane or Matsuoka Yōsuke to break the diplomatic deadlock. According to another theory, the Prime Minister concurrently serves as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Yoshida Shigeru or Horikiri Zenjirō will likely take office as the Minister of Home Affairs. Yūki Toyotaro's entry into the cabinet is almost certain, but it is not possible to predict whether he will be the Minister of Finance or the Minister of Railways. As for the ministers of the military, since the army is strongly opposed to Ugaki, their candidates are attracting general attention. Sugiyama's general director of education, Koiso's lieutenant general commander of the Korean army, Kazuki's lieutenant general commander of the Konoe division, and Itagaki's lieutenant general chief of staff of the Kwantung army are all noteworthy. The theory that the former military councillor, Admiral Suetsugu, will take office as the Minister of the Navy is the most powerful. The Ministry of Justice hopes that Minister of Justice Hayashi will stay in office. Among those who enter the cabinet from the political parties are Nakajima Kuhira, Hatoyama Ichiro, Sakurai Yukio, and Nagai Ryūtarō, and from the House of Peers, Kabayama Aisuke. In addition, at the time of cabinet formation, in order to implement the merger or abolition of provinces in the future, one person may concurrently serve as two or three ministers. Matsumoto Gaku, the former Director of the Police Security Bureau, Ikeda Kiyoshi, the governor of Hokkaido, and Yasui Seiichirō, the director of the General Affairs Bureau, may take positions such as Chief Secretary, Director-General of the Legislative Bureau, and Superintendent General of the Metropolitan Police Department.

<h3>Navy Observes Quietly</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The Navy authorities are taking a wait-and-see attitude towards Ugaki's appointment to form a cabinet. According to the Navy's opinion, if the leader of the succeeding cabinet can overcome the current difficulties, stabilize the political situation, and have strong control, then regardless of which party he is from, he can be supported. Regarding General Ugaki, since his policies and beliefs for opening up the current situation have not been heard, it is intended to temporarily observe the development of the situation. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Business Circles Anxious</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The business community is paying close attention to General Ugaki's cabinet formation work, believing that a cabinet miscarriage is the worst possible situation. If the difficult birth continues, the military's various conditions may be accommodated. It is also now being considered that the weakening of the new cabinet is considered inevitable and is quite worrying. However, since there is no active atmosphere in all aspects, it is hoped that the Ugaki cabinet will be born quickly in order to stabilize the political situation and restore the economy to normal. This voice is extremely widespread. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Right-Wing Groups Urge Ugaki to Resign from Cabinet Formation</h3>

<p>Ugaki, who came from the army, should be familiar with the current situation of the military, but this time he formed a cabinet regardless of everything, which is considered inappropriate. It is hoped that he will be persuaded to resign from the imperial mandate.</p>
<p>The above resolution will be handed over to Ugaki in person. In addition, the Patriotic Labor Comrades Association also convened a national conference of 45 branches this morning and issued instructions, and unanimously resolved to absolutely oppose the Ugaki cabinet and urge it to resign from the imperial mandate, and telegraphed the cabinet formation headquarters to express the situation of the conference resolution.

Therefore, members of the Seiyu and Minsei parties and various factions took their seats with tension. The cabinet member seats were empty. Speaker Tomita rose and said that on the 25th, he received a notice of the cabinet's total resignation and a request to adjourn the meeting until the new cabinet is established. When asked in the meeting hall, Tabuchi Toyokichi rose to object, and two or three other members agreed with him. The speaker did not take it seriously and considered it passed without objection. He announced the adjournment at 1:10 PM. (25th Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. Official Circles Do Not Offer Criticism</h3>
<p>But Value Ugaki as a Person, Saying He Has the Demeanor of a Statesman</p>
<p>[Washington] Official circles here refuse to criticize the Japanese political turmoil, fearing that the U.S. government will interfere in Japan's internal affairs. However, the U.S. officials value General Ugaki, who has been mandated to form a cabinet, and believe that he has the demeanor of a statesman and can adapt to circumstances. Therefore, his policies can be both lenient and strict. (24th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Premier Blum's Speech Causes Repercussions in Germany</h3>
<p>The Principle of Indivisible Peace Considered Insufficient to Resolve the European Situation</p>
<p>[Berlin] The initial reactions in German political circles to the speech given by French Premier Léon Blum are generally as follows: German political circles are satisfied with Léon Blum's statement that France does not intend to offer Germany any sort of haggling proposition. They are particularly pleased with Blum's statement that "France does not wish to exploit Germany's dire economic situation as a means of exerting political pressure on Germany." However, political figures say, "Léon Blum's attitude toward various major political issues does not allow us to agree. Léon Blum opposes entering into bilateral agreements while simultaneously declaring that France is willing to remain loyal to all friendly nations. These two positions are mutually contradictory. In short, 'indivisible peace' is not the only effective solution, and those who abuse the principle of international collective security are not other countries but rather France's own allies. These allies have no intention of reaching an understanding with Germany. It is regrettable that France is now lending them funds to expand their military strength. Moreover, there are reasons to doubt whether Germany has good intentions toward other countries. Germany seeks to gain freedom and equality in armaments through its own efforts, and merely does not wish to be subject to the dictates of other countries." Political figures also stated, "Bilateral agreements concluded between Germany and other countries can satisfy both sides. For example, the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact (signed on January 26, 1934, for a term of ten years), the German-Austrian Agreement (signed on July 11, 1936), the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (signed on June 18, 1935), and the understanding between Germany and Italy have all contributed to resolving European problems. Conversely, the Franco-Soviet Pact of Mutual Assistance is a genuine danger to Europe." Overall, while taking a reserved attitude toward the French Premier's speech, political figures still insisted that Germany is committed to cooperating with other countries and considered Blum's expressed willingness to engage in frank talks with Germany to be a welcome development. However, they believed that past methods should not be reused, otherwise, they will become trapped in a circular argument with no way out. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, an official German critic commented on French Premier Blum's speech in Lyon yesterday, which stated that "the key to peace in Europe lies in Germany." The critic said that the wording of Blum's speech regarding Germany was very friendly and contained no attacks. The critic expressed satisfaction with Blum's belief that Hitler's repeated declarations of peace were sincere. It was stated that Germany cannot recognize the demand for indivisible peace as the only effective method of security, and believes that those who abuse the collective security system are all friends and allies of France. Germany's willingness to cooperate is unlimited. Now that Blum has declared that France is ready to have thorough discussions with Germany, it is a good omen for the future. Blum's speech yesterday was quite unexpected by the newspapers. Blum denied any intention of making a surprising new economic appeal to Germany. Blum declared that the People's Front is becoming stronger and more vibrant, and has proven that a stable government has the ability to protect its national interests and security. Blum reiterated his opposition to bilateral agreements and insisted on the principle of indivisible peace. Blum also supported the suggestion that countries could provide economic assistance to Germany if a peaceful resolution to the European situation could be achieved, but opposed making any demands of Germany that resembled a transaction. Blum also said that the general perception that Germany's economic problems might one day force it to seek aid from foreign countries and be willing to submit to various conditions is illusory and extremely dangerous. On the other hand, it must be understood that an economic agreement cannot be separated from a political solution. France is willing to cooperate, and if Germany also expresses a willingness to cooperate, then France is ready to work with it. Blum concluded that a convention on limiting and reducing armaments is a necessary part of resolving the overall European situation. However, today, the arms manufacturing industry occupies such an important position in national industry that it would be impossible to simply order a halt to arms manufacturing without causing a serious domestic panic. Today, it may be impossible to implement a convention on reducing armaments without supplementary economic agreements. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Excerpts from British and French Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>[London] The newspapers are deeply impressed by the speech given by French Premier Blum in Lyon yesterday, saying that the clear and honest attitude with which he explained France's position is what makes the speech so moving. It is particularly gratifying that the position explained by Blum is completely consistent with that articulated by British Foreign Secretary Eden in his speech on the 19th of this month. It is now up to Germany to state its position. The News Chronicle reported, "Blum's speech complements the shortcomings of Foreign Secretary Eden's speech. What he proposed is neither to haggle with Germany nor to bribe that country. It should be understood that any country that harbors doubts that if it provides economic assistance to a neighboring country, that neighbor might use that assistance to attack it, would naturally be unwilling to rashly assist the neighbor and bring trouble upon itself. What France is now asking of Germany is not to abandon its legitimate demands, but to abandon its policy of armed isolation, which is of no benefit to that country." The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, stated that "Premier Blum's explanation that there is no intention to haggle, so as not to cause misunderstandings among a nation with a proud spirit and keen sensibilities, is wise and commendable. Moreover, Premier Blum's disagreement with some people's doubts about German leader Hitler's repeatedly solemn declarations of peaceful intentions is also a sign of his wisdom. In short, Blum's speech deserves to be called frank and fair." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[Paris] All newspapers, except for the right-wing Paris Echo, warmly welcomed Premier Blum's speech in Lyon yesterday, saying that the theory articulated by the Premier is impeccable. The centrist Republican Newspaper reported, "The Premier's statement that he does not wish to negotiate bilateral agreements with Germany will inevitably lead German newspapers to accuse French foreign policy of being influenced by the Communist Party. But this is not the case. The French government is not controlled by the Moscow government." The right-wing Figaro reported that "what Premier Blum said yesterday is the true public opinion of France." The right-wing Friend of the People reported that the Premier's proposals are theoretically perfect, "but it is not known whether they can be implemented in the future." The moderate Order reported that "the Premier's declarations on foreign policy, especially on Franco-German relations, are indeed based on political realities." The Socialist People's Newspaper and the Communist Humanity commented on the domestic impact of the Premier's speech. The People's Newspaper reported that "the organization of the People's Front will obviously become stronger." Humanity used the phrase "the unity of the People's Front is stronger today than ever before" as its headline. The newspaper also published a dispatch from its diplomatic correspondent in Geneva stating that "as far as we know, this speech has been well-received internationally, which is only natural." Only the right-wing Paris Echo took a different tone, saying that "domestic and foreign audiences who hear the Premier's speech should feel disappointed." (Havas, 25th)</p>

At the same time, it is reported that France is not conducting any loan negotiations with the United States. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Italy and Germany Suggest Ban on Volunteer Soldiers Going to Spain by Submitting Reply Notes</h3>
<p>The wording and content are largely the same</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the prohibition of volunteer soldiers going to Spain to serve, the Italian government delivered a reply note to the British Embassy at 11:00 AM today, stating that the Italian government is prepared to take various appropriate measures regarding the prohibition of recruiting and dispatching volunteer soldiers to Spain, provided that other countries accept the same approach. It also stated that the Italian government has previously made a request, advocating that all foreign volunteer soldiers within Spain be completely withdrawn. As for the method of monitoring the country's land and sea borders, the Italian government's views will be presented at a later date. In addition, the Italian representative to the Non-Intervention Committee is currently drafting a detailed plan to remove political agitators within Spain, so as to make the non-intervention policy complete and flawless. However, if the Spanish Valencia government allows foreign volunteer soldiers to change their nationality to circumvent the government's obligations under the non-intervention policy, the Italian government will raise a reservation. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German government's reply note to the British government is worded almost identically to the Italian reply, agreeing to take the same action when other major powers prohibit volunteer soldiers from going to Spain, and suggesting the withdrawal of all foreigners participating in the Spanish Civil War, including political agitators.

<h3>Situation of the Russian Counter-Revolution Case Trial</h3>
<p>Defendants Give Detailed Confessions of Conspiracy to Overthrow the Current Regime</p>
<p>[Moscow] Political commentator Radek admitted yesterday that he had conspired with anti-faction leader Trotsky and others to assassinate Stalin, but today he attempted to avoid the death penalty, claiming that he did not accept Trotsky's final instruction that Germany and Japan should help him overthrow Stalin. He also confessed that "I know I am guilty. I bear moral, legal, and political responsibility for the terrorist group. Former senior official Bukharin was also involved in the conspiracy." Radek also named foreign ambassadors and consuls involved in the case twice, which angered the judge. (National Military News, 24th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today is the second day of the public trial of the traitors. Many prominent figures attended the court, including the ambassadors of Britain, France, and the United States, when the defendant Radek confessed that he had consulted with senior diplomats about a plan to divide the Soviet Union. The session lasted four hours. All seventeen defendants pleaded guilty on the first day of the trial and are now facing the death penalty. Although Radek was warned by the presiding judge, he continued to mention the names of foreign diplomats from time to time until the judge threatened to adjourn the court. Radek confessed that he realized in 1935 that a Russo-German war was inevitable due to Hitler's ambitions, and that Russia would be defeated in the war. Therefore, he pursued a Machiavellian policy, promising to cede Ukraine to Germany and the Amur region to Japan, and to cooperate with German military staff during the war. This would weaken Russia after the war and make another revolution possible. He had received three letters from Trotsky. The first letter, written in April 1934, stated that German fascism was gaining strength, the situation in the Far East was becoming more serious, and war was approaching, the result of which Russia would be defeated and would create a situation where their group could seize power. Therefore, for the benefit of their group, they should promote the early outbreak of war. The second letter, written in December 1935, outlined the procedure for restoring capitalism and granting land and economic concessions to fascist countries after Russia's defeat.</p>
<p>Former Ambassador to Britain Sokolnikov confessed that he had committed the crime of conspiring with Germany and Japan to overthrow Russia, because of their belief as "defeatists" that German fascism would plunge Germany and Russia into a dead end. He believed that rather than being completely destroyed in the future, it would be better to abandon socialism early and unite with the fascists. The prosecutor then asked Sokolnikov whether Germany would tolerate their government once it occupied Ukraine. Sokolnikov replied that they would rely on other capitalist countries to prevent Germany from advancing further. Later, the Washington correspondent of the News, Romm, testified that he had delivered Trotsky's letter to Radek. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>American East Coast Sailors End Strike</h3>

It is widely believed that the sailors' strike on the West Coast will also end soon, as labor-management negotiations are close to a settlement. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<h3>Severe Flooding in the United States</h3>
<p>Rivers Continue to Rise, Disaster Area Covers Twelve States, Oil Tanks Destroyed, Large Fire Breaks Out in Cincinnati Industrial Area</p>
<p>[New York] The Ohio River is still rising, and the Meteorological Bureau says it is impossible to predict when the river will stop rising. In Louisville, Kentucky, the river has risen more than 15.7 meters, which is 1.5 meters higher than the height of 14.2 meters during the great flood of 1884. A large fire has broken out in the industrial area of Cincinnati, Ohio. In addition, oil pools were broken by water and oil floats on the water surface. The fire is raging, and the flames are as high as 100 meters. The city's fire brigade is currently working hard to put out the fire. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>[New York] Severe flooding in the central and eastern states of the United States has caused a serious disaster. The disaster area covers twelve states, and 400,000 people have been left homeless. The losses are incalculable, and 75 people have died. Scarlet fever and pneumonia have broken out in Ohio and Kentucky, affecting about 100 people. There is widespread concern about the outbreak of an epidemic. Looting of shops has also occurred in Portsmouth, Ohio. In Cincinnati, Ohio, oil pools were broken by water, and oil floats on the water surface. The fire spread and burned down part of the city's houses. The fire brigade tried hard to put out the fire for several hours, but the disaster was horrific with the water followed by fire. A total of 42 houses were burned down and 1,500 were flooded. At that time, it was raining heavily and continuously, and the streets were ankle-deep in water. The total loss is estimated at US$1.5 million. In addition, oil flows on the surface of the Ohio River, so other states are also at risk of fire. At this moment, the Ohio River is 16 meters high and is still rising. In some parts of Louisville, Kentucky, the water is as high as 10 meters. The power plant has also been flooded and the power has been cut off. The entire city has become a dark world, and 300,000 residents are now preparing to move elsewhere to avoid drowning. New Albany, Indiana, has almost completely become a swamp. Residents in Jeffersonville have also been completely evacuated. Authorities in Indianapolis have declared martial law. Authorities in Tennessee ordered the levee to be breached to allow the water to flow into the depression and reduce the impact of the flood. As a result, 53,000 hectares of farmland will become a swamp. The farmers in the area were terrified and formed groups armed with weapons to patrol the levee all night, not allowing the levee to be breached and the fields to be flooded. The reformatory in Frankfort, Tennessee, has been flooded. The prisoners in the reformatory feared drowning and attempted to escape. Twelve of them were shot and killed. Three hundred people drowned in Memphis. There is a small island in the Mississippi River outside the city, and 14 people took refuge there, but their situation was miserable. After receiving reports of the disaster, President Roosevelt was deeply saddened. He immediately consulted with officials from the Federal Relief Administration, officials from the Red Cross, officers from the Army and Navy, and leaders of the Coast Guard. It was decided that he would personally preside over the relief efforts and ordered his staff to report on the disaster at any time without error. So far, a large number of tents, medical supplies, and 4,500 soldiers have been transported to the disaster area to carry out relief efforts. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<h3>The Full Extent of the Food Panic in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Thirty Million Cantonese People Face the Threat of Starvation</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence. Food in Guangdong Province can be broadly categorized into three types: plant, animal, and mineral. Plants include rice, wheat, beans, peanuts, sweet potatoes, etc. Animals include poultry, livestock, fish, shellfish, etc. Minerals are mainly salt. Among these, rice, a plant, is the staple food. As the saying goes, "Southerners eat rice, northerners eat wheat," which shows the importance of rice and wheat to the diet of Guangdong. However, in terms of its own food supply, only salt is produced in large quantities, and meat can be self-sufficient. The most important rice is severely lacking and always needs to be imported. Since the founding of the Republic of China, this province has imported large quantities of food every year from abroad and domestically. Rice is the most imported, followed by flour and other grains. Imports from abroad mostly come from Annam, Siam, Australia, the Netherlands, Singapore, and the Dutch East Indies. Those imported from other provinces are mostly from Anhui, Guangxi, Shandong, Hunan, Jiangxi, and the four northeastern provinces. According to customs statistics, Guangdong Province imported over 179.8 million dan of foreign rice and grains from the 22nd year of the Republic of China (from the first year to the 22nd year), worth over 78.8 million taels of customs silver. On average, more than 8.1 million dan were imported annually, worth over 35 million taels of customs silver. In addition, the amount of domestic rice imported from other provinces is also considerable. In total, over the past 22 years, an average of over 2 million dan have been imported annually, worth over 9 million taels of customs silver, with Anhui rice accounting for half of it, and the rest being Guangxi, Jiangxi, and Hunan rice. Judging by this, the combined import volume of foreign and domestic rice averages about 10 million dan per year. It is evident that the rice production in Guangdong is low and the food problem is serious.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Famine</p>
<p>The supply and demand situation of rice in Guangdong Province is roughly as described above. Therefore, if crops fail or foreign rice imports decrease, a famine will immediately appear. Recently, due to drought and floods, rice fields in various counties have suffered crop failures. In addition, after import tariffs on foreign rice were levied in accordance with the central government's regulations, the source of supply was suddenly blocked. Consequently, supply fell short of demand, and rice prices rose daily. The price of low-grade brown rice, which used to be 13 catties per yuan, now needs to be doubled. That is, one yuan can only buy more than 6 catties. The price of grain per stone has also risen from over 4 yuan per hundred catties to over 9 yuan. The high rice price has broken the highest record of the past 20 years. The public suffers from this and groans in pain, telling each other in horror, and is restless all day long. The people in the counties have already felt extremely poor due to rural bankruptcy and frequent natural disasters. Coupled with the severity of the rice famine, they inevitably fall into a state of starvation. In severe cases, such as in Nanhai, Gaoming, Shunde, and Sanshui counties, famine-stricken people have even started robbing rice. Even in Zhongshan, which is known as a model county, people are eating sugar and dirt due to the rice famine. The miserable situation is self-evident.</p>
<p>The Situation in Guangzhou</p>
<p>As for Guangzhou City, although it is a prosperous metropolis, the general public also feels overwhelmed, especially those who have no rice stored at home and will inevitably face food shortages and the threat of starvation. As a result, social order is becoming increasingly uneasy. The observable impacts are roughly as follows: ㊀ Rice prices have been rising for days, and poor people in the city gather in front of rice shops, lamenting and sighing, which has become a common sight. As a result, the theft of rice is rampant. In order to prevent the poor from robbing and stealing, rice merchants store all large quantities of rice in warehouses or back rooms and dare not place them in the shops. The rice baskets displayed in front of the shops are all covered with wire mesh to prevent anyone from taking advantage of the situation to rob and steal. The precautions are extremely strict. ㊁ The food-saving movement of the poor laborers. The soaring rice prices hit the poor in the labor sector first. Originally, each person ate two jiao of rice per day, but now it costs four jiao. Families with several members are even worse off, but their labor income has not increased. Therefore, many people work hard all day long but cannot get enough to eat. As a result, a food-saving movement has recently become popular. For example, poor people in the areas of Dabe, Xiaobei, Zhuhengsha, and Dongsha mostly eat rice for one meal and sweet potatoes and taro for the other. They can save a small amount of money for rice every day and change to eating miscellaneous grains to fill their stomachs. ㊂ Under the shroud of economic depression and the long-term high price of rice, small-capital businesses and handicraftsmen in the city, unable to afford the increased food expenses, have dismissed the short-term and casual workers they hired in order to save expenses. Even middle-class households have dismissed the servants they employed for the same reason. The number of unemployed people in the city has increased sharply as a result. Compared with the end of last year, it has increased by at least 10,000. The crowding in employment agencies looking for work is also unprecedented. ㊃ Due to the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people and the high cost of rice, the trend of eating "blessed food" for free is becoming increasingly popular. It is said that groups of three to five people have formed to beg for food from shops. The police are also overwhelmed. The industry has been severely affected by this and has reported to the trade association to find ways to ban it. ㊄ The impoverished people from suburban villages have united to enter the city in search of food. In the villages in the northeast suburbs, a rice famine has recently occurred, and many impoverished people have suffered starvation. They have been entering the city in droves for days, begging for food from shops. Some are supporting the elderly and leading the young, wandering everywhere, and they are all from the surrounding villages. Most of them are emaciated and miserable. All of these phenomena are sufficient to reflect the extreme panic and turmoil in society. As for the amount of rice stored in the city, according to the survey, there are 574 rice shops in the city, with only over 3.93 million catties of rice in stock, which is only enough for a few days. The serious situation is particularly worrying. With the end of the year approaching and winter defense being urgent, the people are unable to make a living, and the future of social order is unimaginable.</p>
<p>Appeals from the Authorities</p>
<p>After investigation, the causes of the rice famine in Guangdong Province are very complex. The main reason is that crop yields in the province have decreased sharply due to natural disasters, and rice production has been greatly reduced. It is inevitable that imports are needed to supplement the supply. However, due to the heavy taxes, foreign rice merchants are afraid and have stopped importing. Rice from other provinces cannot be supplied steadily due to transportation difficulties, resulting in this famine. The military and political authorities of this province deeply feel that the crisis is imminent. At this time of the year-end and tight winter defense, the maintenance of social order is worrying everywhere. Therefore, various agencies have jointly formed a civil food regulation committee with the banking community to engage in civil food regulation work as a temporary solution. In addition, Director of Pacification Yu Hanmou and Chairman of the Provincial Government Huang Musong have repeatedly telegraphed the central government, earnestly appealing to them to consider the difficult situation of civil food and approve the exemption of import tariffs on foreign rice. At the same time, they have urged rice from neighboring provinces to be transported to Guangdong in a continuous stream in order to suppress rice prices and save this disaster. Provincial and municipal party headquarters and various community organizations have also telegraphed their response, earnestly requesting the central government to adopt their request in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<p>Relief Measures</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Civil Food Regulation Committee, it has been committed to planning civil food regulation methods. The committee has held repeated meetings and discussed many relief plans, which are being implemented in order. At the same time, it has sent personnel to Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces to purchase large quantities of rice. It has also sponsored the banking community in this province to establish a rice pledge syndicate to be responsible for the purchase, transportation, and storage of food. The total amount of the pledge is set at 4 million yuan. The central, Chinese, transportation, farmers, Shanghai National Products, Central and Southern Salt Industry, Jincheng, Guohua, Guangdong Dongya and other banks, provincial and municipal banks, Guangxi Provincial Bank, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau are allocating the amount of burden as appropriate to contribute to the progress. In addition, the Guangzhou Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Committee also believes that civil food is closely related to the national economy. It has specially convened economic experts and relevant parties to hold a symposium on civil food issues and discuss them in detail. The following decisions were made: ㊀ Request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Finance to completely exempt the foreign rice tax, temporarily for six months. ㊁ Request the Executive Yuan to order the authorities of the four provinces of Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Hunan to stop rice merchants from hoarding. ㊂ Request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Railways to fully supply rice transportation vehicles and reduce transportation costs. ㊃ Request the Executive Yuan to order the Ministry of Transportation to instruct the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to reduce rice transportation costs. ㊄ Request the central government to reiterate the ban on the export of domestic rice until recently. Regarding the request of this province to exempt the foreign rice tax, the central government has decided to allocate vehicles from the Yuehan Railway to transport Hunan rice to Guangdong and to allow the Civil Food Regulation Committee to purchase and transport foreign rice, with half of the customs duties recorded on the books, with an amount of 300,000 metric tons. An order was issued to the local authorities of this province to comply. The Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Provincial Government, upon receiving this order, immediately drafted and announced the flexible measures for purchasing and transporting rice. The content is as follows: ㊀ Merchants and people may freely operate the purchase of foreign rice in accordance with these measures. ㊁ When foreign rice purchased passes through the coastal ports, only half of the customs duties that should be paid shall be paid, and the remaining half shall be recorded on the books, which shall be borne by the provincial government. ㊂ Merchants and people who purchase foreign rice shall report the quantity of rice purchased, the amount of tax paid in cash, and the amount recorded on the books to the Food Regulation Committee for verification. ㊃ All matters related to the purchase and transportation of rice shall be supervised and managed by the Food Regulation Committee. Currently, all sectors of this province believe that food relief is urgent. In order to quickly solve the rice famine problem, they will jointly hold a Rice Famine Relief Conference on the 23rd to discuss further effective measures. It has been decided on the spot to promote the provincial and municipal party headquarters, the provincial and municipal chambers of commerce, the provincial and municipal education associations, the rice industry association, the food association, the banking association, the civil industry association, the general machinery union, the shipping association, the seamen's union, the civilian shipping union, the Guangzhou office of the Yuehan Railway Bureau, the special party headquarters of the Yuehan Railway, the municipal reporters' association, the daily newspaper association, and the women's association. 19 groups will jointly form the Civil Food Relief Committee and telegraph the central government: ㊀ Increase the amount of tax-free foreign rice. ㊁ Order the rice-producing provinces such as Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei to immediately transport rice to Guangdong and restrict them from collecting export taxes. ㊂ Order the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to allocate more ships to transport rice to Guangdong and exempt transportation costs. ㊃ Order the Ministry of Railways to fully supply rice transportation vehicles and reduce transportation costs. The text of the telegram submitted by the association to the central government is attached below: Nanjing Central Party Headquarters National Government Executive Yuan Ministry of Finance: The rice situation in Guangdong is alarming. The Executive Yuan and the Ministry have approved the purchase of 300,000 metric tons of foreign rice with half tax recorded on the books. We in Guangdong are grateful for this great kindness, but after assessing the actual situation, it is still not enough to solve the current predicament. Today, a Rice Famine Relief Conference was held by all sectors of society. It was resolved to establish the Guangdong Civil Food Relief Committee, and unanimously appealed for the temporary full exemption of foreign rice tax so that rice from Vietnam and Siam can be quickly imported. Please also reduce or exempt steamship and train transportation costs and find ways to urge Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces to transport rice to Guangdong as soon as possible to alleviate the crisis. Respectfully telegraphed appeal, please approve. The Guangdong All Sectors Rice Famine Relief Conference Koutou.</p>
<h3>Heavy Sales Tax on Imports in Jiangxi Province</h3>
<p>Sales Tax is Like a Local Levy, All Sectors Petition to Abolish It</p>
<p>Jiujiang Correspondence. Since Jiangxi Province suffered from banditry, the production of goods has decreased sharply, and purchasing power has declined. The trade volume of imports and exports from Jiujiang has been declining. The total trade volume in the 17th year of the Republic of China was 69,115,951 customs taels, but in the 21st year, it was only 37,028,850 customs taels. However, the local authorities of this province also added a production and sales rehabilitation tax in that year, levying a special tax of 2.5% to 15% on all imported and exported goods. Although all sectors have argued with the authorities that a local levy similar to this should not be created after the central government abolished the local levy, it was ineffective. The amount of donations collected over the years has been over 2 million yuan. Last year, the authorities believed that the export of goods was dwindling and that little was collected. The production tax was abolished, but the amount of donations not only did not decrease, but increased more than before due to the increase in the sales tax. The current annual revenue is about 2.8 million yuan. All goods imported from Jiujiang and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway are unpacked and inspected by the sales tax bureau, and revalued. They are only released after the tax is collected. If there is any concealment or omission, a heavy fine of 50 times the amount will be imposed. Currently, all industries in Jiujiang and Nanchang believe that the market is sluggish and cannot bear this burden. If it is passed on to consumers, the cost will increase and sales will be affected. It has been decided to contact fellow villagers in Beijing and Shanghai again to petition the central government to abolish the sales tax, which is a disguised form of local levy, so that the cost of all imported goods can be reduced by 10%, which will benefit the future of commerce and the livelihood of civilians.

<h3>Continued Report on the Shandong Match Industry Dispute</h3>
<p>The United Office went to Jinan to petition, and the result was satisfactory. Chairman Han agreed to telegram Mayor Shen to find another solution.</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence. Eighteen match factories in Shandong, Luxi, Zhendong, etc., jointly organized an office because the articles of association of the National Match Production and Sales Joint Corporation and the agreement signed with foreign merchants had monopolistic and power-losing aspects, unanimously opposed it, and telegraphed the Shandong Provincial Government, Qingdao Municipal Government, and the Nanjing Executive Yuan and Supervision Yuan for appeals. They also elected representatives to go to Jinan to meet Chairman Han to petition. It is now known that the representatives returned to Qingdao from Jinan this morning (24th). According to reports, the results of the petition in Jinan were satisfactory, and there may be another solution in the future. The details of Mayor Shen's mediation process and this petition to Jinan are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mediation Process</p>
<p>Since the National Match Industry Association convened the second interim representative meeting in Shanghai in March of last year and passed the articles of association and other plans for the joint corporation, the merchants believed that the articles of association and the agreement of the joint corporation were illegal and power-losing, and it was difficult to accept them. They put forward their opinions as fellow traders, first questioning the Qingdao branch and then sending representatives to Shanghai to request the general corporation to amend them. They ran around to negotiate, but to no avail. In September of last year, Mayor Shen Honglie mediated the solution. At that time, Chairman Liu Hongsheng of the Shanghai General Corporation came to Qingdao, and the two parties convened representatives at the municipal government to discuss a solution. The conditions put forward by the representatives of the joint office were: 1. Join the corporation first, retain it for three months to amend the articles of association and the agreement. After the articles of association and the agreement are amended and submitted for registration, the share capital and expenses will be handed over to the corporation. Otherwise, they will not be restricted by the articles of association and may withdraw from the corporation at any time. 2. The production quota of each factory shall be distributed equally according to all the machines of each factory in the country and the annual output of all the factories in the country. However, all small factories must rise and not fall in order to provide relief. 3. Two directors of the general and branch corporations must be elected from the 18 merchants, and one supervisor and one manager of the branch corporation may be elected. Mayor Shen then proposed a compromise solution based on the above three conditions. 1. Agreed to do it. 2. Calculate the production quota according to twice the amount promised by Liu Hongsheng, and allow the small factories to rise and not fall in order to maintain their survival. 3. Allow the 18 merchants to elect one director of the general and branch corporations and one general manager of the branch. At that time, Liu did not adopt the compromise solution proposed by Shen, resulting in the failure to reach a result. Therefore, the joint business fell into a stalemate. On January 9 of this year, the merchants received a letter from the joint general corporation, which was instructed by the Ministry of Finance. The letter stated that the Ministry convened a meeting at the Taxation Department on November 16 and 17 of the 25th year with the participation of personnel from the Ministry of Industry, and notified the company to have responsible personnel attend to explain the situation. The two ministries discussed and decided to limit all Chinese match factories to join the joint venture by January 20 of this year. Otherwise, the Ministry of Industry would cancel its registration, and the Ministry of Finance would stop selling flowers and issuing licenses. The merchants believed that their survival was at stake, so they held an emergency meeting a few days ago. In addition to telegraphing the authorities for appeals, they also sent representatives Yu Jiesan, Li Jianzhai, Guo Xinshan, Zhang Ziyu, and Sun Donghai to Jinan to petition Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Petition Result</p>
<p>After arriving in Jinan, the representatives visited Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government and Director Zhang of the Construction Department on the 22nd of this month to explain the intentions of the merchants and submitted the following three items for maintenance: 1. Please telegraph the two ministries of finance and industry to suspend the implementation of the method of canceling registration and stopping the sale of flowers and issuing licenses, or to allow flexible handling to maintain the industry. 2. Please telegraph the two ministries of finance and industry and the Executive Yuan to instruct the National Match Production and Sales Joint Corporation in Shanghai to convene a national match industry representative conference as soon as possible to jointly discuss the method, properly amend the articles of association, and the agreement signed by the company with foreign merchants in order to establish it as soon as possible. 3. Please telegraph Mayor Shen of Qingdao to jointly find ways to maintain it in order to relieve business difficulties and maintain people's livelihood. Chairman Han and Director Zhang have agreed to handle the three points raised by the representatives and agreed to immediately telegraph the Shanghai Joint General Corporation and Mayor Shen of Qingdao Municipal Government to convene a meeting in Qingdao in the near future to discuss a solution. The representatives believed that the results of the petition were extremely satisfactory, so they returned to Qingdao from Jinan this morning to report everything to the merchants. (January 24)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Intensifies General Re-Investigation of Opium and Drugs</h3>
<p>Since the general re-investigation of opium and drug offenders in this county began at the beginning of this month, the county government has sent personnel to reside in the eight districts under its jurisdiction to be responsible for the general re-investigation of each district. In recent days, more than 100 opium and drug offenders have been arrested and sent to the county one after another. The county-run hospital's drug rehabilitation center is already full of people and has been sent to the detention center of the court in batches for rehabilitation. In order to supervise the various districts to step up investigations, County Chief Li has additionally sent senior officials such as the chief of the Public Security Bureau and the chiefs of the various sections to serve as supervisors in each district. County Chief Li personally went to the various districts to urge them on the 25th and finished on the 31st. Day-by-day re-investigations have been carried out in and out of the city, and many have been found.</p>
<h3>Nanhui Water Public Security Team Seizes Bandit Weapons</h3>
<p>The aquatic public security team stationed in Datuan Town patrolled the Shixianggong Lane area of the town the night before last and saw five people with suspicious behavior. The team interrogated them and found that the five people, Li Ashun, Li Baisen, Huang Qiusheng, Shen Zhida, and Zhang Liansheng, according to Li Ashun, intended to rob a certain sock factory in Shenjia Pier and a certain surname in Wanxiang. There were still many accomplices hiding in the Xiangdong Inn. Team Leader Zhao immediately led the police there and continued to arrest six people including Yuan Jingen and Gu Quanlin. They also found two pistols and ten bullets, which the bandits had buried near the wall of the Central People's School. They have been sent to the county government for interrogation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Female Prosecutor Arrives in Xin</h3>
<p>The criminal court president and prosecutors of the local court have all been transferred in large numbers recently, and the old and new have been replaced. It is now learned that female prosecutor Fang Liqin (from Dinghai, Zhejiang) arrived in Xi from Shanghai on the evening of the 24th. At 8 am on the 25th, she went to the local court to meet with President Cui and Chief Prosecutor Qian to take up her post. There are many female lawyers and female clerks in the judicial circles of the county, but female prosecutors are still a novel concept.</p>
<h3>Changshu Smallpox and Meningitis are Rampant</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the abnormal weather and uneven cold and warm temperatures, smallpox and meningitis are rampant. Dozens of children have died from these diseases, and the spread is extremely rapid. The county-run hospital has purchased a large number of smallpox vaccines to vaccinate people to prevent the spread.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou Established Small Loan Association</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Bank Industrial and Commercial Small Loan Committee stipulates that there shall be five members, one appointed by the local county government and four appointed by the county chamber of commerce. The amount of the committee's loan shall not exceed 2,000 yuan. For loans of 500 yuan or less, the borrowing industrial and commercial store shall seek two reliable store guarantees, which can be borrowed after the committee approves and stamps them with a seal. The interest rate is 1%. For loans of more than 500 yuan, it must be reported to the head office for verification. Now the Yangzhou Bank has organized the association in accordance with the regulations. The county has selected Guo Lanshi, a standing committee member of the Provincial Business Federation, and the county chamber of commerce has elected Chairman Teng Yizhai, standing committee members Zhu Lisun, Jiang Yunqiu, and Chang Shizhi, a total of five people, to serve as members of the association. Yesterday (23rd), the organization process was reported to the head office so that loans can be started to relieve the opening situation of previous years.</p>

<p>All sectors of Nantong have specially organized the National Contribution One Day Income Movement Promotion Committee. A propaganda conference was held on the 23rd. Government officials, military police, school staff and students, industrial and commercial women from all walks of life all solicited donations in accordance with the standard.</p>
<p>Extorting Arrears in Land Tax</p>
<p>The county government has outstanding land tax arrears of as much as 1.3 million, so it has set up an arrear recovery committee and sent police to extort from door to door. The amount collected in recent days has been extremely strong, with more than 600,000 yuan already collected. In addition, after taking over the stove tax, the arrears of old taxes were huge, so strict measures were also formulated to urge them and submitted to the Finance Department for implementation.</p>
<h3>Aftermath of the Hangzhou Capsized Ferry Tragedy</h3>
<p>More than 100 workers from the Kangyi Company, a contractor of the Qiantang River Bridge project, took a small ferry to the middle of the river on the evening of the 23rd at 11:30 pm to change shifts. Because the boat was small and there were too many people, the load was too heavy, and it collided with the iron bucket protecting the bridge piers, causing it to sink and causing an unprecedented tragedy. According to the investigation, the confirmed number of workers on the ferry was 106, and only 27 people were rescued. 79 people were drowned. As of this afternoon, 54 bodies have been recovered. At 10 am, the Hangzhou Land Court sent a prosecutor to lead officials to verify the situation, and the Jianyi Company temporarily placed all the bodies under the thatched shed. On one hand, they purchased clothing and coffins to enshroud them in the evening, and on the other hand, they promised to provide generous condolences. The problem of the good-looking people can be discussed and decided that night.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Basketball Association’s Sinton Team Loses to All Blacks Without Key Players</h3>
<p>35 to 31, Liangxi Defeats Qunyi</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association held three matches last night. The Sinton team's key players, such as Lan Yin, did not participate. Although Carson supported the remaining players, they were ultimately defeated by the All Blacks. Their renowned name of several years has now suffered repeated setbacks. In the second-tier group, Weiming took the lead in the first half with a lively performance, scoring 23 to 15. In the second half, Yidui invigorated their efforts and once managed to equalize the score. In the end, Weiming won with a score of 35 to 21.

Then, Liangxi brought in fresh troops, Zhang and Zhou, greatly boosting their morale. Their score gradually increased, closing the gap and eventually tying the score, resulting in a 22 to 22 tie in the first half. In the renewed battle, both sides were ambitious, and the competition became even more intense. They tied three times at 26 to 26, 30 to 30, and 38 to 38.

<h3>The First Game of the Xiqing A Division Championship: Zhou Mu'er Defeats Jingwu</h3>
<p>Adopting a Best-of-Three System, the Second Game Will Continue Tonight at 8 PM. The Start Date of the Overall Championship Depends on Tonight's Results.</p>
<p>The Mu'er team, which has the highest hopes for the championship, suffered a tragic defeat to the Zixiong team last week, making the A Division championship of the Xiqing Ordinary League difficult to predict. Now, Mu'er and Jingwu, who share the same score, must again compete in the A Division championship cycle, still adopting a best-of-three system. Last night was the first game. After the clash, both sides were too nervous, resulting in many missed shots. Hua Yulin and Zheng Jichang both committed double fouls, but neither made their free throws. After two minutes of stalemate, Hua Yulin of Mu'er finally scored from the side, opening the record. Jingwu immediately called a timeout. Soon after, Li Ruihua of Jingwu made a basket, tying the score at 2-2. The cheerleaders also cheered wildly. However, Dong Yangfeng, Huang Cunrui, and Hua Yulin of Mu'er then made three consecutive shots, gradually pulling ahead. Jingwu, on the other hand, often wasted opportunities with inaccurate long-range shots. Although they called another timeout, it did not improve the situation. Jingwu ended the first quarter behind with a score of 2 to 8. In the second quarter, Che Liangting of Jingwu first made a long-range shot, while Huang Furui and Hua Yulin of Mu'er each made a free throw. Li Ruihua of Jingwu also made one free throw due to Dong Yangfeng's foul, making the score 5 to 11. However, Zhang Jinxuan was too nervous and missed both free throws, and also missed a good opportunity under the basket. Soon after, Li Ruihua made a long-range shot, finally closing the gap to 7 to 11. Mu'er called a timeout. Sure enough, Hua, Shen Hanjun, and Dong Yangfeng scored three more consecutive baskets, and Mu'er took the lead with 17 to 7 in the first half. After switching sides, Cai Zhixian and Che Liangting of Jingwu each scored twice, and Mu'er called a timeout. Dong, Huang, and Dong scored four times under the basket, quickly recovering the lost ground. Soon after, Li and Cai of Jingwu added three more points, and the third quarter ended with a score of 25 to 14, with Mu'er still holding an absolute advantage. In the final quarter, Hua, Huang, Shen, and others of Mu'er scored continuously, increasing the score to 33 to 14. After Jingwu called a timeout, Cai Zhixian also scored two baskets. Until the last two minutes, Mu'er had secured the victory and replaced Huang Cunrui with Lin Peng. Huang Cunrui scored another basket for Mu'er, leading them to a great victory over Jingwu with a score of 36 to 18. The second game will be held tonight at 8 PM. If Mu'er wins again, they can compete with Yuezhong for the championship without having to hold a third game. Therefore, whether the overall championship game will start the day after tomorrow depends on tonight's results.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 25th, Central News Agency) Central Committee Member Wu Zhihui, at the invitation of Jinling University, attended the school's memorial week on the 25th and gave a lecture on "Life Should Be for the Purpose of Service." In his speech, he first stated that the true essence of life should be for the purpose of service, not for the purpose of acquisition. He then stated that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's nationalism is to maintain the survival of our nation, not to invade other nations. His democracy is not to seize power, but to guide the people to have a proper understanding of politics. His livelihood is to solve the problem of national survival. Finally, he stated the fallacy of Marx's class struggle, that we should struggle with material things, not with each other.</p>

<h3>Current Situation of Guangxi University</h3>
<p>Lowest Tuition Fees in the Country; No More Than a Hundred Yuan Per Year</p>
<p>Higher education in Guangxi focuses on cultivating specialized talents needed for the province's construction, including Guangxi University, Guangxi Provincial Normal College, and Guangxi Provincial Hospital. Guangxi University is located in Wuzhou and has three colleges: Science, Agriculture, and Engineering. Originally, there were eight departments: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Agronomy, Forestry, Civil Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. Recently, the provincial government, due to the province's rich mineral resources and the lack of talent to exploit them, ordered the engineering college to set up a mining specialization course in the autumn of the 23rd year. In January of the 24th year, the Ministry of Education ordered the mining specialization course to be expanded into a department. Therefore, in the autumn of the 24th year, the Mining and Metallurgy Department was established. Due to the lack of researchers, enrollment has been temporarily suspended. So, now there are only eight departments and a high school attached. The university has a total of 360 students, and the attached high school has 235 students. The university faculty has 114 people, and the attached high school has 33 people. Since the school focuses on practical science, equipment is naturally the most important. The College of Science was established the earliest, and the general experimental equipment of each department is quite sufficient. Recently, a lot of optical instruments and theoretical chemistry instruments have been purchased. The College of Agriculture also has sufficient instruments, specimens, models, and medicines for horticulture, soil, animal husbandry, veterinary medicine, afforestation, tree measurement, and plant pathology. The College of Engineering has various new machines and surveying machines in the mechanical factory. Recently, a materials laboratory has been added, and it has received a subsidy of 10,000 yuan from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund to purchase mineral processing machines. In terms of the library, the collection includes about 5,000 Chinese and foreign books, 24,000 rare ancient books, 6,800 Chinese and foreign magazines, and 28 kinds of Chinese and foreign magazines. In recent years, the books and magazines needed for reference and research in various colleges and departments have also been greatly supplemented. Military training is very important at Guangxi University and has been implemented for more than four years with good results. In the 23rd year, it was divided into management and training. Since the 24th year, the management team has also increased training. Currently, the four male dormitories are divided into four teams, and the female nurses form one team. Each team has one captain, two deputy captains, and one assistant teacher. The training and management methods are strictly and conscientiously carried out in accordance with the "Guangxi Middle and Above Schools Military Training Regulations." The school's funding is reduced as much as possible. This year's recurrent expenditure is 284,681 yuan, and the temporary expenditure is 111,760 yuan. Before the 22nd year, the annual temporary expenditure and recurrent expenditure accounted for about 50% of the school's total funding. This year, the temporary expenditure only accounts for 24% of the school's total funding. Although the funding is not much, it can well reflect the spirit of hard work and perseverance. The school's fees are very low. Students only pay 15 yuan (equivalent to 12 yuan) per semester for tuition, 40 hao yuan for food, 5 hao yuan for accommodation, 6 hao yuan for miscellaneous fees, 1 hao yuan for sports fees, and 3 hao yuan for experimental fees. The annual cost is no more than 100 yuan, making it the most affordable university in the country. The school has a student work-study program, and poor students can work at the school to subsidize their expenses.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<h3>Public Bonds Set New Record</h3>
<p>Short Covering and Adding Positions Occur Simultaneously; Prices Rise Across the Board</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange witnessed a fierce short squeeze during the final session of the January futures, undiminished by the current situation. Short covering and swaps were particularly active, while major bullish players continued to add large positions. The market price rose steadily, with all recent bond series reaching new highs. Series Wu reached 64.95 yuan, Series Bing reached 65.10 yuan, and Series Yi reached 68.50 yuan, all setting new records since their listing. Today, only the February futures for one month will be traded. Due to the firm confidence, the bond market is quite turbulent and showing an abnormal trend. At the opening yesterday morning, due to short covering by retail investors, No. 45 was actively absorbed, and the trend was consistently firm, rising by 0.05 to 0.15 yuan. In the second session, the market price continued to rise. Series Wu saw a sharp increase of 0.45 yuan in recent contracts due to active short covering. Series Ding and Jia also rose by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan due to crowding buyers. At the afternoon opening, Series Wu's recent contracts suddenly saw a large number of physical goods being sold off, and the market price dropped sharply by 0.40 yuan. However, buying interest in Series Bing and Yi remained strong. Nos. 4, 77, etc., were being acquired, all rising again by 0.05 to 0.30 yuan. The short covering became more intense at the closing, with Nos. 10, 50, and 35 being actively swapped, and Nos. 16 and 71, etc., being heavily bought. Series Wu and Yi rose again by 0.05 to 0.30 yuan, with Series Li even rising by 0.55 yuan. The distant contracts for all bonds were even firmer.

A comparison of the daily fluctuations and highs and lows is listed below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Coarse Yarn Sales Suddenly Active; Bulls Prepare to Take Delivery</p>
<p>Final Session Raised to 253 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm. This month is the final act, with both bullish and bearish sides having considerable opposing forces. It is said that 5,000 bales will be delivered, but the bullish side is accepting all of them and may even exceed that number. Therefore, the market first fell and then rose. Currently, yarn merchants from southern Guangdong and Guangxi are particularly active in purchasing, with 10-count coarse yarn being the majority. Traders are purchasing forward contracts to protect their short positions on spot yarn. Inland merchants are particularly eager to collect futures. Therefore, the market was good in the afternoon, and confidence was strong. The final session price for this month was 253 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan compared to the previous month.</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Prices Rise Again Across All Months</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with this month's contracts being the last day. The bullish side held onto February contracts. It is reported that the spot price of 10-count coarse yarn has risen sharply by 1.00 to 2.00 yuan. The bearish side is collecting and transferring delivery chips, tightening the market. Short-term investors are actively covering their positions, and the market is uniquely firm. However, distant contracts are not seeing particularly strong sales in the spot yarn market, and Osaka Sanpin yarn is trending downward. Although the bullish side is strongly pulling up prices, the result is that recent contracts have risen by 1.00 to 1.90 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price, while distant contracts have risen or fallen by 0.10 to 0.50 yuan. The market suddenly softened in the afternoon, as about 5,000 bales of 10-count and 20-count yarn were delivered to the warehouse. Sentiment was slightly weak, coupled with the sluggishness of Sanpin yarn. The second session fell again by 0.08 yuan, with distant contracts unchanged. By the third closing, it was reported that merchants from Guangdong, Yunnan, and inland areas were actively purchasing spot yarn, and the bullish side was determined to take delivery, and prices across all months turned upward. As a result, prices across all months rose by 0.15 to 1.00 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sales were as follows: Hengyi 3,750 bales, Deda 800 bales, Dafeng 800 bales, Taixing 650 bales, Changji 650 bales, Ruida 950 bales, Renfeng 650 bales, Dachangcheng 1,750 bales, Taichang 2,250 bales, Xiecheng 2,100 bales, Yichang 600 bales.

All payments starting from the 1st will be made with bank or money shop drafts with a maturity of six days, which will be the end of the day. The market will resume as usual after the opening on February 15th.</p>
<h3>Ample Delivery Chips; Cotton Falls Sharply by 0.45 Yuan This Month</h3>
<p>The cotton market was quiet and weak, as cotton stocks have not decreased and there are ample delivery chips, disappointing the bullish side. At the same time, the world cotton industry is bleak and weak, and confidence is increasingly sluggish. The final session price for this month was 42.10 yuan, a decrease of 0.08 yuan compared to the previous month. The future of the cotton market remains in a state of hesitation.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Distant Months Still Flat</p>
<p>The spot cotton market opened with ample deliveries for this month, coupled with the overseas cotton market trending steadily downward, and the Osaka Sanpin cotton falling even more sharply, further dampening confidence. However, trading in the market was particularly sluggish. As a result, prices across all months fell by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. The market fell again by 0.15 yuan in the afternoon due to active deliveries and weak bullish sentiment, while distant months remained flat. There were no changes after the first session. As a result, prices for this month fell by 0.25 yuan compared to the morning closing price, while distant months remained unchanged. Sales were as follows: Dafeng 1,100 dan, Juxing 1,100 dan, Tongji 1,100 dan, Yutai 5,300 dan, Hexing 2,800 dan, Senkang 2,100 dan, Changfeng 4,700 dan, Runkang 3,200 dan, Tonghe 1,100 dan, Xincheng 4,000 dan, Xiecheng 1,100 dan, Fukang 1,500 dan.

The daily high and low prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Active</p>
<p>The current cotton mills have gradually improved, with 2,042 bales of Yao cotton and 1,258 bales of Tong cotton received.</p>
<p>Sanpin Yarn and Cotton Fall Uniformly</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 25th, spot yarn fell by 1.00 to 3.00 yuan. 16-count Fanmian was 250 yuan, down 1.00 yuan. 20-count Jinyu was 269 yuan, down 1.00 yuan. 40-count Wuxing was 410 yuan, unchanged. 42-count Zhizi was 395 yuan, down 3.00 yuan.

Futures cotton fell by 0.06 to 1.30 yuan, with recent contracts at 75.10 yuan and distant contracts at 77 yuan.</p>
<p>US Cotton Fluctuated Narrowly Last Week</p>
<p>According to a telegram from New York, cotton prices fluctuated narrowly last week. New speculative interest was limited, as the general public was awaiting the publication of detailed information on the sale of pledged cotton. The tendency of manufacturers to sell and settle purchase prices was the main trend of the week. However, most bullish investors, seeing the weakness of various markets, settled their positions, disappointing many. Strikes and favorable European news had stirred up selling sentiment, and restrictions on exchange rates in Japan also caused unease. However, the cotton market strongly resisted the pressure, so the market was generally believed to be stable. Currently, there is a surge in the dumping of low-grade goods, as merchants expect competition to be more intense when pledged cotton is sold, and the market price has loosened. However, inquiries from manufacturers have improved, and very few high-grade cottons are available for immediate shipment.</p>
<p>According to the New York Cotton Exchange's weekly statistics, arrivals totaled 10,307,000 bales, an increase of 190,000 bales from last week and an increase of 270,000 bales from the same period last year.</p>
<p>Shipments to factories totaled 4,755,000 bales, an increase of 188,000 bales from last week and an increase of 297,000 bales from the same period last year. US cotton exports since August 1st totaled 3,414,000 bales, an increase of 104,000 bales from last week and a decrease of 620,000 bales from the same period last year. Shipments to Japan totaled 889,000 bales, China 19,000 bales, the United Kingdom 732,000 bales, and Germany 447,000 bales. There is currently no inventory in New York. New York's inventory last week was 1,000 bales, and the same period last year was 55,000 bales. US inventories totaled 4,689,000 bales, lower than last week's 97,000 bales and lower than the same period last year's 211,000 bales.</p>
<p>World visible supply totaled 8,460,000 bales, a decrease of 16,000 bales from last week and an increase of 163,000 bales from the same period last year. US cotton accounted for 6,214,000 bales of the total.</p>
<p>Since August 1st, US cotton shipments to world yarn factories totaled 7,345,000 bales, an increase of 318,000 bales from last week and an increase of 892,000 bales from the same period last year (unit: thousands of bales).</p>
<p>Indian Cotton Fluctuated with Sanpin Last Week</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, Sanpin fell sharply, causing bullish investors here to settle their positions and futures traders to sell off. Afterwards, Sanpin rebounded, and sellers dared not resist further, engaging in short covering. A large amount of cotton, originally intended for shipment to Japan, has been temporarily suspended due to Japan's control of foreign exchange. Spot cotton is relatively quiet, Lancashire is mediocre, and inquiries from various places are scarce. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: thousands of bales).</p>

<h3>Stockpiling of Cotton Cloth Revives</h3>
<p>400-500 Bales of Spot Fine Cloth Collected</p>
<p>The cloth market was slightly firmer yesterday. Although overseas cotton markets were uniformly declining, the recent markets for spot yarn and cotton turned firmer, and the stockpiling sentiment of cotton cloth hoarders revived. Local and inland merchants absorbed 400 to 500 bales of spot fine cloth, coarse cloth, and fine twill cloth. Forward trading was also active. Dongmian and Ito firms opened offers for over 400 bales of fine cloth from Dongpi, Rihua Factory's Jixiang brand, Shanghai Factory's Lanri brand, and Qingdao goods' Santao brand for February, March, and April futures. Market prices for forward contracts were all firm by 0.025 to 0.05 yuan per piece. The supply of Toyota Factory's Dancing City Cloth and 84 Cloth was particularly scarce, and sales prices rose sharply by 0.10 yuan per piece. Merchants from the southwest, Sichuan, Guangxi, and Guangdong were uninterested in buying. Merchants from Hunan were slightly buying white goods, fine cloth, fine twill cloth, and colored cloth. Inquiries from Jiangxi, Hubei, and Anhui were also quiet. However, merchants from Tianjin in the north were slightly buying coarse cloth, and merchants from Shandong also saw a decline in buying interest. The colored cloth market was sluggish. Luen Chang's Hao Xia blue cloth was reduced by 0.20 yuan per piece, and colored twill cloth also fell by 0.01 to 0.02 yuan per piece. The markets for broadcloth, Zhigong, serge, and printed cloth were flat. Sales prices for our factory's fine cloth and fine twill cloth also stabilized.</p>
<p>Western Zhigong Sells Well in Tianjin</p>
<p>Imports Have Been Greatly Reduced in Recent Years; Recently, Sales Have Suddenly Increased, Clearing Out Inventories</p>
<p>Western yuanqing Zhigong wool fabric, since the introduction of eastern and domestic products and Zhigong magua jackets, has seen a great reduction in imports. Old brands such as Rongtai, Anli, Deji, Lulin, and Gongyi have struggled. Foreign firms have either switched to Dongyang Zhuangkou or closed down one after another. According to investigations by customs, imports of Western yuanqing Zhigong wool fabric have decreased by two-thirds compared to three to five years ago. Unexpectedly, things have reached an extreme and rebounded. Last year's abundant harvest in rural areas and the revival of commerce have greatly increased sales of wool fabrics. The demand for Zhigong has suddenly increased, and old inventories of Western yuanqing Zhigong are being sold out one after another. Most have been bought up by Tianjin merchants. It is reported that Western Zhigong sales are quite strong in Tianjin. Recently, Tianjin merchants with ample funds have been sending letters and telegrams to Shanghai to continue purchasing. However, Shanghai's inventories are also depleted, so the market atmosphere has recovered.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Hainan Red Slices and Qing Slightly Decline</p>
<p>The sugar market trended weak yesterday. The association's negotiated price for Grade 24 coarse white spot goods was 23.20 yuan, but no transactions occurred. Transit goods were traded at 7.60 to 7.55 yuan, down 0.01 to 0.05 yuan. Eastern white spot goods also fell slightly by 0.01 yuan, with Grade 4 J Mark at 23.25 yuan and Grade 8 and 9 SH Marks both at 22.85 yuan. Transit goods were unchanged. The local factory's Mianbai Zhenji Grade 1 was 22.20 yuan, with the remainder following the decline. Merchants from Guangdong and Chaozhou offered over a hundred bags of spot Hainan red, with slices at 14 yuan, down 0.01 to 0.02 yuan. Dozens of bags of spot Beihai green slices were negotiated by the association at 11.40 yuan, down 0.02 yuan. Those who could deliver next week offered 11.20 yuan, with over 200 bags traded. The combined company's Shantou coarse white was offered at 22.80 yuan, and medium sandy white was offered at 20 yuan, but no transactions occurred. (Due to limited space, the sugar market reports for the past few days have not been published.)</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Passed a Steady Year</p>
<p>Foreign Sugar Greatly Affected by Smuggling; Domestic Sugars Enjoyed Smooth Sailing</p>
<p>The sugar industry in 1925 was repeatedly plagued by rumors of tariff reductions on foreign sugar in May and June. As a result, market prices for Dutch coarse white, Dutch red, Eastern white, and Eastern red were sometimes weak, with very few opportunities for profit. For example, Dutch coarse white once rose to over 22.70 yuan in January, but afterwards, it was in a constant state of decline and fluctuation, reaching a low of 21.50 yuan. The largest difference for the year was 1.20 yuan. The market trend for Eastern white was similar. Taking Grade 8 white as an example, the highest price in January was 22.30 yuan. From February to September, the market was in a decline, with the lowest price at 21.10 yuan. There was a slight rebound in October, November, and December, with the highest price only reaching 21.40 yuan. The highest price for Grade 8 and 9 Dutch red was 17 yuan, and the lowest price was 15.60 yuan. Eastern red was similar, with a difference of 1.20 to 1.30 yuan. The foreign sugar market was completely overshadowed by rumors of white sugar smuggling and tariff reductions in North China, and remained weak and difficult to recover. Fortunately, the tariff reduction on foreign sugar was never implemented, and although market prices were weak, the decline was still small. Otherwise, there would have been an even greater decline.</p>
<p>As mentioned above regarding foreign sugar, it can be seen that it was not accidental that those engaged in this industry found it difficult to profit. The biggest reason for this was smuggling of Japanese sugar. The rumors of tariff reductions also originated from this. However, the overall market price fluctuations were not large. Even if there were losses, the amount was very small. Moreover, domestic Chaozhou sugar had excellent opportunities. For example, green sugar, taking Huanggang goods as an example, once reached a low of 10 yuan in January. The market rose in February, March, and April, reaching a high of 11 yuan. In May, it fell back to 9.80 yuan for a time, but it gradually rose in June, July, August, September, and October, with the highest price reaching 14.50 yuan, an increase of nearly one-third. The profits that could be made during this period can be imagined. However, different firms had different practices. Those who bought more and sold less made more profits, followed by those who bought and sold at the same time. Therefore, those who focused on domestic sugar last year could be assured of profits. Firms such as Junyisheng Kee, etc., devoted themselves to this, and their results were certainly good. Other firms with strong financial resources, such as Yuansheng, Yufengheng, and Fangcuihe, etc., could also profit. The market trends for Diaoqing, Pianqing, Mianchi, and Hainan Red were largely the same. The lowest price for Diaoqing was 9.30 yuan, and the highest price reached 13.50 yuan, with a difference of 4.20 yuan. The lowest price for Pianqing was 7.80 yuan, and the highest price reached 10.70 yuan, with a difference of 2.90 yuan. The lowest price for Mianchi was 12 to 13 yuan, and the highest price reached about 16 yuan, with a difference of about 4 yuan. The lowest price for Hainan Red was 10.90 yuan, and the highest price reached 14.40 yuan, with a difference of 3.50 yuan. The price fluctuations were all around 3 to 4 yuan, and the market trend was mostly rising more than falling. Those engaged in this industry were in an advantageous position, and profits were inevitable. Other specialty goods, such as miscellaneous white Jianbing, etc., were also no less profitable. There was also a large portion of domestic Wuyang coarse white, with the highest price at 22.70 yuan and the lowest at 21.30 yuan, with a difference of 1.40 yuan. The local factory's Mianbai, such as Zhenji Grade 1, had a highest price of 21.60 yuan and a lowest price of 20.30 yuan, with a difference of 1.30 yuan, all on a steady trend. The Wuyang coarse white was mostly bought and sold at the same time, with very little risk. Overall, although foreign sugar was not easy to profit from, it did not cause much loss. Coupled with the excellent opportunities for domestic sugar, the sugar industry in the past year, if not for smuggling, would certainly have had special achievements in this time of abundant agricultural production. However, smuggling in North China ultimately led to a weak market trend, and the results for foreign sugar were diminished. However, what was lost in the east was gained in the west. Domestic green and red sugar had smooth sailing and made great profits. Furthermore, very few accounts went bad last year, which further indicates the stability of the sugar industry. It is predicted that most will certainly profit at the end of the year. Even those with slightly less successful results need not worry about suffering losses. It is said that during the Shaanxi Incident, those with larger accounts in this area were quite concerned, but recently, the sugar market has seen a resurgence in foreign sugar prices due to the rising prices of Dutch sugar. Domestic Chaozhou sugar has also seen rising prices due to the lack of inventory and active winter sales, leading to a rise in all types of sugar, with a prosperous and rosy outlook. The market prices at the end of last year and recently are listed below for reference (unit: yuan).</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods</h3>
<p>Hunan Merchants Actively Buying Large Quantities of Jinshan Branches</p>
<p>Due to the revived sales of Jinshan flat branches produced in Guangdong in Hunan, over a thousand pieces have been purchased in recent days. As a result, listed prices have suddenly become tight, rising by 2 to 3 yuan compared to before, and many are still unwilling to open offers immediately, intending to sell at good prices in the spring market. At the same time, market prices have also risen accordingly. Higher-quality goods must be sold for 37 to 38 yuan, with slightly reduced prices for the next tier. Continued tightness in the market seems likely.</p>
<h3>Finance</h3>
<h3>Spot Gold Rises and Then Relapses</h3>
<p>The Bullish Side Continues to Lower Prices by 0.20 Yuan</p>
<p>The gold market initially saw overseas silver markets declining slightly or remaining unchanged, with varying exchange rate fluctuations. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both the British and American rates flat and customs gold unchanged. The standard gold price rose to 1154 yuan. The morning opening was slightly higher, initially rising after the opening but then falling as large players had varying demands for supply. However, spot traders had stronger buying interest, and prices rose again briefly. The bullish side then proceeded to unload, and the market became unstable. The swap discount has now fallen to 1 yuan. Here is a summary of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1152.70 yuan, slightly higher by 0.10 yuan compared to last Saturday. Shengyuan Yongjin rose to 2.90 yuan. Yuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, Hengyu, and Dafengheng were selling off, retreating to 2.60 yuan. Qingfa and Yongdai Shengyuan Yongli bought, and the price rose to 3 yuan. Yuanmao and Yonghengyu continued to offer supply. The noon close was 1152.80 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 1152.70 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuanmao, and Yonghengyu all sold. The closing price retreated to 1152.40 yuan. The price only fluctuated by 0.60 yuan throughout the day, and the market continued to fall by 0.20 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price rose to 1154 yuan due to the Central Bank's standard gold price listing, which was about 2 yuan lower than the closing price. The spot market was calm. Tongfenghang once purchased 140 taels of this brand of refined gold at 13 yuan above the listed price. This was sold by silver shops. Tianjin goods were sold at 12 yuan above the listed price. The selling price of refined gold was 14 yuan, and the buying price was 10 yuan. There was a market without transactions. The swap discount fell to 1 yuan due to the urgent need of the bearish side to settle in. Taichangxiang sold 126 bars, Yuanmao Yong sold 84 bars, and Qiaofen Yong sold 28 bars.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was scarce. Overall, Tongtaichang and Shengyuan Yong Qingfa Yong were on the buying side, while Yuanmao Yong, Hengyu Dafengheng, and Dadecheng were on the selling side. In addition to public contracts, there were only 41 bars left for this month. There was a total of one bullish player and one bearish player. There were 2,191 bars left for February, with a total of 6 bullish players and 15 bearish players. There were 5,173 bars of chips for March, with a total of 23 bullish players and 20 bearish players. The total number of transactions was 420 bars in the morning and 119 bars in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Today, Tongfengyu of the bearish side cleared 1,386 bars in public contracts, Tongfengheng cleared 539 bars, and Dingkang cleared 35 bars. The bullish side should receive a total of 1,960 bars, including 868 bars for Futaiheng, 392 bars for Chunyuan Yong, 252 bars for Qiaofen Yong, 238 bars for Qingfa Yong, and 210 bars for Shengyuan Yong, at a settlement price of 1149 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Settlement Slightly More Active</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market trended slightly lower due to slightly higher exports and tighter banking funds in Japan. The morning initially saw overseas telegrams reporting that London telegraphic transfers, both near and far, had narrowed by 0.0625. The New York silver market was closed, and the distant forward silver price in Monterry saw no changes. London spot gold rose by half a penny. The British rate against the US rate narrowed by 0.0625. The US rate against the French rate rose by 3 points. The British rate against the Japanese rate narrowed by 0.03125. The US rate against the British rate rose by 0.0625. The US rates against the French and Japanese rates were flat. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, with both the American and British rates flat and customs gold unchanged. At the morning opening, the British and American rates were flat. After the opening, customers continued to sell Harbin yuan, while Japanese banks remained flat. HSBC listed the British and American rates as flat. The white silver balance tax was slightly above 0.025. The market hovered in the middle. Later, due to interbank trading and swaps, coupled with the fact that Japanese banks were still absorbing eastern remittances, the situation was slightly balanced. The afternoon was also the same. Later, banks traded more among themselves and the market was flat. The Dalian merchants continued to pledge remittances related to Japanese remittances, but they were absorbed by Japanese banks. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the near and far rates for both the British and American currencies were flat. Chinese merchants sold about 200,000 yuan of distant Japanese remittances, while Dalian merchants sold about 300,000 yuan of spot miscellaneous remittances related to Japanese remittances. Here is a record of the day's transactions:</p>
<p>The morning opening for the British remittance was a selling price of 1 shilling 2.59375 pence for the near term. HSBC sold January contracts to foreign firms at 59375. Later, Oriental Bank sold January contracts at 59375. The closing selling price was 1 shilling 2.59375 pence for spot and January contracts, 53125 for February contracts, and 5625 for February contracts. The buying price was 0.03125. The volume traded was about 30,000 pounds.</p>
<p>The morning opening for the American remittance was a buying price of 29.8125 yuan. Macgary bought January contracts at 875. Citibank sold February contracts at 75 to Zhengjin. Zhengjin sold January contracts at 84375 to Citibank. Zhongxing sold February contracts at 75 to Macgary. Citibank and HSBC bought January contracts at 84375 and sold March contracts at 6875. Later, North China sold April contracts at 625 to Shanghai. HSBC sold February contracts at 75 to Zhengjin. They bought spot contracts at 84375 from Zhengjin. Oriental Bank bought spot contracts at 815. The closing selling price was 29.8125 yuan for spot and January contracts, 71875 for February contracts, and 65625 for March contracts. The buying price was 0.0625. The volume traded was about 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Zhengjin and Chao xian purchased Harbin yuan spot at 105.25 yuan and 0.5 yuan. Mitsui and Sumitomo bought Japanese yen April contracts at 104.625 yuan. Mitsui Zhengjin bought spot Harbin remittances at 105.25 and 375. Chao xian sold Dalian April contracts at 505 yuan. Zhengjin purchased spot Harbin remittances at 25. Mitsui bought spot Qingdao remittances at 125. The volume traded was about 300,000 yuan for Japanese remittances, 200,000 yuan for Dalian remittances, and about 200,000 yuan for other remittances.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Sluggish Actual Sales, Near Weakness and Distant Strength in Flour and Wheat</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months initially fell and then rose, eventually showing a pattern of near-term weakness and long-term strength. The price of foreign wheat was reported as Chicago up one-eighth of a cent, Canada up four cents, and Liverpool down one penny. Therefore, at the opening, the prices of foreign wheat fluctuated. Market sentiment was generally unstable, so although the initial prices for all months were down one cent from the previous week, factories observed and waited. Outside clients gradually absorbed supplies, so sentiment became mixed, and buying interest was relatively strong. As a result, prices for all months rose by two, three, or four cents. By the afternoon opening, the current month had only one and a half days left until delivery, and most hedgers were directly taking delivery from factories. However, inland factories had 40,000 to 50,000 bags prepared for delivery, so bulls had even less room to maneuver, and the price fell to as low as eight dollars and one cent. However, long-term sentiment remained firm. Given this situation, the market was entirely driven by hedging. The difference between the current month and January had reached seven and a half cents, and the difference between February and March had reached six cents. Therefore, if actual sales do not improve, near-term prices will likely be hit first.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market in the morning, prices for all months showed a pattern of near-term stability and long-term gains. The price of foreign wheat fluctuated. The current month was nearing delivery, and factories were unwilling to take delivery due to sluggish flour sales, so the opening price once fell to six dollars and five cents. However, prices quickly rebounded. For long-term months, many short positions were closed due to settlement, resulting in stronger buying interest, and prices rose by three, six, or seven cents. By the afternoon opening, the settlement of the current month was already complete, with little change. Prices rose by one cent. Trading in February and subsequent months became quiet, and the market showed consolidation, with slight fluctuations of one or two cents compared to the morning. With the final settlement date approaching by one day, if there are no major changes abroad, the market can pass through this period calmly. Currently, the wheat market is sluggish for near-term standards, and asking prices are also loose. Wheat from Jiangbei is quoted at six dollars, one dime, two cents, and three cents. However, some shipments from the Jinpu Railway area, with very good quality, are only quoted at six dollars, two dimes, and five cents, with only two to three thousand bags seen.</p>
<p>Jing Rice Hoarders Show Slight Movement</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, due to continuous rain, only over twenty sources of supply arrived, totaling about four thousand piculs. Thin rice accounted for thirteen or fourteen sources, while Qingdao dealers continued to sell two thousand-odd packages of rice. Therefore, market conditions were slightly tight, and prices rose by five cents. Thick japonica rice, due to normal sales in this area, showed no significant fluctuations. Du Yang sharp rice also lacked any changes. Yin Bian Yuan had limited sales channels and may fall slightly further.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about thirty boats arrived from various routes downriver. Sales in various markets were flat. However, white japonica rice hoarders showed slight movement, and prices in the early market rose slightly. Limited transactions in the afternoon market slightly improved, causing prices to stabilize. Early rice was flat and weak, thin rice down a few cents, and Bai Yuan also showed weakness. Prices for other goods were flat with a hint of stability.</p>
<p>Ke Xian Rice Relies Solely on Guangdong Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice sales to Guangdong were very strong, with 20,000 bags of rough machine rice being shipped through various routes. Therefore, even before the end of the year, various cargo owners rushed to pay taxes, but market prices remained stable. However, demand in this area was sluggish, and yesterday's market only saw slight improvements. Shantou dealers also made minor accommodations. Therefore, although sales to Guangdong were strong, market prices were difficult to raise further, and the intention of large-scale hoarding was also stagnant. Prices for all rice remained flat and stable. The total amount of Jiangxi rice sold yesterday was 10,100 bags, Xiang rice 6,112 bags, Wen Xian 3,500 bags, Han rough rice 4,500 bags, Jiaxing rough sharp rice 200 bags, and factory broken rice 39 bags. Rough rice accounted for more than half of the total.</p>
<p>The Miscellaneous Grains Market is Already Concluding</p>
<p>Payments are Settled During the Kitchen God Festival</p>
<p>The market conditions for various miscellaneous grains are already concluding, so there are no significant changes. The payments for goods bought and sold in the market are settled during the Kitchen God Festival, according to custom. Therefore, regardless of the date of the transaction, all payments must be made in cash on February 4. As a result, trading has been slow recently. Yesterday, only this area and the Tongzhou dealers in inland areas inquired about yellow soybeans, with sales of over 1,800 bags of open-mouth Zha soybeans, 800 bags of Hankou late soybeans, 214 bags of Dingjiazhou soybeans, 100 bags of Pinghu Du soybeans, 100 bags of Jiujiang late soybeans, and over 230 bags of Jiujiang winter soybeans.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Hui Si Iron Exceeds 40 Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, the fixed price of Hui Si iron has soared, so prices in this area have also increased accordingly. Furthermore, the current stock of Qi iron is limited, so the general market price has exceeded the 40 yuan mark. Yesterday, over 300 boxes were sold, with each box priced at 40 yuan and five cents. It is said that canning factories and cigarette companies are actively collecting supplies.</p>
<p>New Arrivals of Thick Iron</p>
<p>Recently, the market for thick iron has been extremely scarce, leaving buyers with little hope of finding goods. Yesterday, New Taikoo Wharf received 600 boxes of new stock, which were ordered by a certain iron merchant on North Suzhou Road. It is said that 400 boxes have already been taken away, purchased by the Ordnance Factory, with a price of 75 yuan. The retail price is 85 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Few Silk Transactions by American and French Merchants</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the overseas silk market, the current and forward prices in Yokohama fell slightly by two yuan. New York was closed due to the weekend. In Shanghai, there were slight sales. White factory silk grade 78 sold for 825 yuan, raw silk grade 78 sold for 780 yuan, and grade B without uniformity sold for 760 yuan, down 40 yuan from the peak price last month. Yesterday, foreign firms made a few transactions with American and French merchants. Domestic textile factories had little interest in purchasing due to the upcoming Lunar New Year. Market prices also fell slightly by about 20 yuan compared to the previous period. A total of 87 bales were sold.</p>

<h3>Praisers of War</h3>
<p>Being busy with military preparations is war itself; the battles fought on the battlefield are merely a public display of the skills acquired during peacetime. (James)</p>
<p>Although the country is secure, it is perilous to forget war. (Sima Fa)</p>
<p>War is a major element in maintaining world order. Human morality is only elucidated through war. Without war, the world would degenerate and be submerged into who knows what abyss. (Moltke)</p>
<p>Treat wartime as peacetime work, and peacetime as wartime work. (Napoleon)</p>
<p>If war ceases, humanity will perish. Therefore, only war is good. (Bakunin)</p>
<p>War is the scale that God uses to weigh nations, the touchstone to test nations, the winnowing fan that eliminates the weak and retains the strong, and the only means by which people can collectively dedicate all their strength with a single purpose. If there are good leaders, victory is possible; if there are weaknesses, failure is inevitable. (Steinmetz)</p>
<p>War is the father of all things. (Heraclitus) (Lu Dan)</p>
<h3>Traces of Wang Baochuan</h3>
<p>— Wang Yongtao</p>
<p>The play "Wang Baochuan," after being adapted and directed by Mr. Xiong Shiyi, caused a sensation in Europe and America, who regarded Wang Baochuan as the eternal and immortal chaste woman of China, which is indeed a glory for women in our country. Now, I will briefly record the traces of Wang Baochuan, which I believe the readers will be happy to hear.</p>
<p>In the northern countryside of Fengxiang, Shaanxi, there is an old tomb in the vicinity of wasteland. Although it was magnificently built at the time, it has been more than a thousand years since then, so it has been damaged beyond repair. The weeds and wild flowers grow luxuriantly on the barren soil, covering the entire tomb. Tall trees surround it, and the inscriptions on the stone tablet are blurred and unclear. However, upon closer inspection, one can vaguely see the words "Tomb of Wang Baochuan, Chaste Woman of the Tang Dynasty," which is obviously her burial place. Because the location is remote, with open fields and few people, only during the peach and plum blossoming spring season do groups of traveling men and women come to visit, admiring the relics. Moreover, women, deeply impressed by her struggles as a poor and chaste woman, are willing to kneel and pay their respects to express their sympathy.</p>
<p>Wang Baochuan's suffering cave dwelling is located in front of Wujiapo on the bank of the Honggou ditch in Qujiang Pond, south of Chang'an City, Shaanxi. After her death, a memorial hall was built in the open space to the left of the cave, but it was also dilapidated due to years of neglect. Therefore, a grand new memorial hall was rebuilt last spring, and construction was completed in early November last year, magnificent and brand new. Inside the hall are clay statues of her and her husband, Xue Pinggui. The unveiling ceremony was held on the 21st of the same month, and people from far and near flocked to see them, breaking the silence of the once deserted scene.</p>
<h3>Postman</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>For twenty years, the relationship between the postman and me has been extremely close, so my fondness for the postman is truly indescribable. My fondness for the letter-delivering postman began in my student days. At that time, I was studying in Nanjing. The school was far from the city, so there were only two mail deliveries per day. At that time, I was a young child who had just left home, so I naturally missed my family often. Therefore, whenever the postman brought me a letter from home, I would always extend my affection to the green-clad messenger and feel an indescribable gratitude. Even more so, during the first few days of each month, the green-clad messenger would often bring me registered letters with money orders from my father and older brother.</p>
<p>After leaving school, I was confined to my hometown. My hometown is a small village in Jiangnan with fewer than one hundred households, so my only companion for dispelling boredom was the far-reaching postman, who brought me the Shen Bao newspaper and letters from friends every day. The last time was when the old postman delivered me a notification letter from a family friend who had successfully introduced me to a job. As a result, I left my hometown and joined the ranks of Shanghai. However, my relationship with the postman did not diminish from that time onward; on the contrary, it became even closer because, from that time, I developed a friendship with a girl. Over three or four years, friendship turned into love. During this process, we went from one letter every half month to one letter every ten days, one letter every week, and finally one letter every three days. By the time we were about to get married, we were writing one letter a day, sometimes even two letters a day. Therefore, I believe that the green-clad messenger was not only my job introducer but also, in an invisible way, no less than my marriage matchmaker.</p>
<p>My relationship with the postman did not end with marriage. Even now, I still rely on the postman's tireless efforts to maintain all my connections with my family in my hometown and the friendships with relatives and friends scattered in all directions. Since last year, I have transferred to the mail order department of a service organization, so my relationship with the postman has become even deeper because, if the postman does not come to my door one day, I will have absolutely nothing to do.</p>
<p>Society is progressing day by day. Human affairs are becoming more complex day by day. Although transportation tools such as trains, automobiles, ships, airplanes, telegraphs, and telephones are so advanced that they are sufficient to cope with complex human affairs and promote society, in terms of "stability, speed, and affordability," the postman's service should still be considered second to none. Based on my life experiences, I feel that the favors I have received in my life, given to me by the green-clad messenger, are among the things I will never forget in my life.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Sheshan</h3>
<p>— Yinghua</p>
<p>Ever since Mr. Zhang from Songjiang told us about the magnificence of the Sheshan Church, I have always wanted to go there. Last Saturday, the sun was warm and the weather was particularly clear, so everyone agreed to take a trip to Sheshan.</p>
<p>After arriving in Songjiang, we rented a car and arrived in half an hour. The car stopped in a broad square with scattered tiles and bricks, surrounded by vast fields.</p>
<p>Rather than calling it climbing a mountain, it is more like crossing a high bridge. From the mountain gate upwards, there is a wide and flat slope. The trees on both sides of the mountain are quite far apart, creating a solemn and tranquil atmosphere. At the top of this slope is a police station, followed by stone steps. After walking a few dozen steps, the flat and bright old church is in front of us. Down to the left of a stone platform, many Chinese men and women are kneeling respectfully in prayer. Three shrines, with Jesus and his parents standing solemnly, allow people to admire their majestic appearance and lament their benevolence. At the feet of the Virgin Mary, a young Chinese woman is weeping, having lost her husband and seeking the Virgin Mary's forgiveness for her sins. Here, our Bodhisattvas have already lost their divine powers and the love of their people!</p>
<p>Going further up, facing us is the statue of Jesus' crucifixion, followed by stone carvings depicting the prelude to Jesus' crucifixion. Then, the mountain path winds upwards, with a small pavilion at the beginning and end of each section, each inscribed with the various stages of the crucifixion, with a verse from the Bible quoted above. After walking through all fourteen pavilions, we reached the end, and a great and simple building appeared before us. This is the church that was built from 1927 onwards, and it is the achievement and foundation that the French painstakingly created and planted on our land over nine years, hoping to use these white stones to buy the hearts of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Because it was not a time for worship, the door was closed. We managed to negotiate with the gatekeeper through a small door on the side before we could enter. The atmosphere inside was indeed too serene. In the center was a dazzling golden shrine, and Jesus, dripping with blood on the cross, was nailed high up. The scene would truly bring tears to the eyes of believers. The construction inside was extremely solid. The pillars were all pieced together from large stones, smooth and strong. It is said that the workers who built this church were all trained, and they were required to hammer one stone each day, not too fast and not too slow, so the project was particularly accurate. After we rested for a while on the pews where people sit to worship, we quietly walked out, marveling at the power of others. The broken walls and ruins outside the church reflected in the setting sun, retaining the grandeur of the Daxiong Hall from more than a decade ago!</p>
<p>It was already one o'clock in the afternoon when we came down the mountain. We ate the zongzi we had brought at a small teahouse opposite the station and then took the three o'clock public bus back to Songjiang City with a large group of tourists!</p>
<h3>The Women's Country of Xinyang Port</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiaokan</p>
<p>—An Interesting Page of Local Customs—</p>
<p>—A Scandalous Little News Story—</p>
<p>Although Yancheng is a city bordering the Yellow Sea, it is still more than two hundred and ten li away from the sea. To the south is the Doulong Port; to the north is the Xinyang Port. Both of these ports are vast. At the same time, they have a very important relationship with the Chinese fishing industry. During the time when fishing boats return in September and October, the dozens of li of vast sea surface are completely occupied by fishing boats, leaving no space at all. —In the location of the Xinyang Port, there is a small village town, which the locals call Huachuan Port, which is also the women's country that the author wants to write about.</p>
<p>How did this Huachuan Port come to be called "Women's Country"? The reason is that transportation from Yancheng to the beach is too inconvenient. There are only a few uneven dirt roads with thorns up to the knees. Paved roads are simply non-existent. At the same time, rickshaws; motorcycles;... it can be said that even a shadow is rarely seen. Only wheelbarrows (small cars) can be used for transportation. The speed of wheelbarrows is very slow. In fact, it is impossible to push them for more than two hundred and ten li in one day. In this sparsely populated wilderness, if one is caught overnight, wouldn't there be a great danger? Therefore, generations of fishermen with wives and children felt the hardship and inconvenience of traveling back and forth, and many moved to Huachuan Port, which is close to the sea, to build houses and live there. At first, there were only thirty or forty households, but in recent years, it has increased to more than two thousand households. Moreover, during the fishing season in March, men over the age of ten in each family have to board ships and sail south to fish in places like Liuhe; Hupu; and Wusong, and they will only return fully loaded at the end of September or early October in the lunar calendar. —During this long half-year, only women guard the doors in the town of Huachuan Port, so it has become a strange women's country!</p>
<p>In this small town, because the residents have a spirit of unity and strong physique, although no public security organs have been established, the place is very quiet, and pirates dare not easily harass them. Moreover, everyone is willing to endure hardship and work hard to fight for their livelihood, so every household has warm clothes and full stomachs, with no worries, and simply does not know that there are any hardships in the world!</p>
<p>Although there is no complete shop here, the embroidery rooms of a group of women are decorated very luxuriously, with everything from toothpaste; perfume; snow cream;... all available. It turns out that these famous cosmetics are all bought back by their husbands when they sail south.</p>
<p>The women on Huachuan Port are all beautiful and charming. During these six months, only women guard the homes in the town. Therefore, a group of proletarian bachelors in Yancheng dare to go to Huachuan Port, and that little bit of casual flirtation scatters to the east and west only when their husbands are about to return by boat.</p>
<h3>Change of Nest Luan Phoenix</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 10 (Silk Handkerchief Conveys Tender Feelings, Strange Words Cast Mistakes; Yellow Flowers Face Withered Autumn Letter Adds Sorrow)</p>
<p>That day, after careful calculation, on the afternoon of the next day, he selected a book and revised the letter to Menglan again. As before, he had Liu Ma take it to the Li family. After two days, Menglan responded to the letter, and Youmei had already delivered the letter, so there was no doubt. However, since that misunderstanding, Youmei had not come at all, but she continued to deliver letters for the two of them. Time flies, and the summer vacation of several dozen days passed in a blur. Guoqi still went to school to teach, and Menglan still went to school to study. The alley they used to pass through often has now returned to meeting again. Guoqi was already thinking three days before returning to normal that he had not seen Menglan for more than two months, and he did not know if Menglan was thinner or fatter. Or still unchanged. Moreover, with these few months of friendship, each other's feelings will be more progressive, and there will be a chance to meet again, and they will definitely get along well, and they can always have a few words. Thinking like this, he only hoped that day would come so that he could admire this progressive achievement. And after finally enduring until this day, he calculated the time and set off on this road. Under this situation, it can also be said that they are telepathic. When he walked into this end of the alley, Menglan also walked into that end of the alley. Guoqi had prepared a few days ago that when he met Menglan this time, he did not need to panic. First, he fixed his feet, then took off his hat, and finally bowed. Then he smiled and said: Miss Jiang is still studying in the original school in the second half of this year! After he responds, he probably won't mention the matter of communicating with each other, but he will definitely praise his own literature. At that time, he would smile and agree with him that there was nothing to take, although a lot of writing was published, it was only a kind of hard work. The following words cannot be predicted, only to reply to the camera at that time. But preparing these words, the ceremony of the first meeting is complete. He felt very calm in his heart and walked forward along the alley. By the time the two could see each other, Guoqi's heart was pounding wildly, and a blush flew up on his face, turning red to the back of his ears. The more he walked forward, the lower his head became. Lowering his head, he could only see two or three feet of the road in front of him. Until the two were only three or four feet apart, his own timid thoughts were finally overcome by his own love, so he stopped and glanced at the person opposite him. Menglan walked slowly from a distance. When they were almost close enough for their clothes to touch, he suddenly stopped and stared at Guoqi with his bright eyes. (127)</p>

<h3>Past Events Unrelated to "Diplomatic Secrets" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenxiang</p>
<p>When the enemy intensifies their efforts against us, in addition to the military secrets that must not be leaked, the internal movements of the diplomatic front, anyone with a sense of nation, a slightly ethnic consciousness, also knows that there are many things that cannot be easily spoken out. Of course, it is best to be able to strive to be "tight-lipped." However, under a principle that is neither related to military secrets nor related to diplomatic secrets, we may as well talk about a few past events.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Xu Shumo, the Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, before he entered the diplomatic world fourteen or fifteen years ago. Everyone knows that Xu Mo in the diplomatic world is from the lowest position, gradually rising from north to south, to the position of director, and then from the director of the European and American Department to the current position of Political Vice Minister. He is a modern Chinese political figure who is respectful, humble, and has no bureaucratic habits. He speaks very beautifully (he is good at diplomatic rhetoric but not glib.) He is familiar with very troublesome diplomatic etiquette, and he has no frivolous demeanor. Originally, he was an excellent English teacher in a middle school. He had no temper with his students, but the students were always afraid of him. Nowadays, some teachers often either perfunctorily deal with students in every way, or compress the curriculum so tightly that students dare to be angry but dare not speak out, and thus gain the favor of the principal. Xu Mo was not like this to his students. He believes that since students come to school to seek "knowledge," of course, questions and answers are most important. Especially in English teaching, to practice correct pronunciation and fluent response, he always has to call up many students in English to answer the questions he raises. Once, his principal (Li Quan, principal of the Eighth Middle School in Yangzhou) wanted to learn English and gently pushed into his classroom, sitting on the last row of school chairs. Mr. Xu, regardless of the principal's intention, still held the custom of calling up students in order according to the rows. Because when calling up students from the front to the back of each row, according to the custom of English teaching, it is possible to save time and convenience by simply saying "Next." The people behind will stand up when they hear it. Although Principal Li was sitting in the last row at the time, Mr. Xu did not let him go either. Principal Li was tall and burly, and running to the classroom to be a student was just as interesting as when Feng Huanzhang, Deputy Chairman of the Military Commission, went to the classroom of the Army University, making people notice it and feel interesting at first glance. When Principal Li was called up by Mr. Xu in English, because his English level was very low, he had to stand there blankly for a moment. Later, he never came to Mr. Xu's classroom again.</p>

<h3>Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Regions Held a Joint Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Unanimously Endorsed the Results of the Income Tax Research Association; Telegraphed the Legislative Yuan to Pass the Commercial Registration Law</p>
<p>Representatives from chambers of commerce in various regions held a joint meeting at the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce at 10:00 AM yesterday. Fourteen representatives from the chambers of commerce of Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Jiangyin, Shaoxing, Jiaxing, Wujin, Yixing, Qingpu, and other counties attended. Sun Qianqing was elected chairman, and Yan Esheng was the recorder. The following resolutions were passed: ㊀ Regarding the results of the Income Tax Research Association's discussion, the important points should be telegraphed by the chambers of commerce in various regions to the Ministry of Finance for separate amendments and supplements: (A) Regarding income from profit-making enterprises, to expand the scope of public reserve funds, change the progressive amount to super-progressive, raise the starting point to 1%, increase the tax brackets, increase reasonable bad debt prediction reserves, capital official interest, and compensation for associate managers, and extend capital reporting to one month after the closing of accounts, totaling four points; (B) Regarding salary and remuneration, to raise the starting point to 50 yuan and increase the tax brackets, totaling two points; (C) Regarding income from securities interest, for stores withholding taxes, please refer to the bank's usual practice and give a 20% bonus; (D) Regarding accounting issues, the account books and records should only be taken to the extent that they are sufficient to prove the case, and the government should not forcibly change them to avoid disputes. ㊁ Regarding the business tax issue, the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce was assigned to draft the document, which will be jointly requested by chambers of commerce from various regions. ㊂ Telegraphed the Legislative Yuan to expedite the deliberation and implementation of the Commercial Registration Law as a remedy for joint and several liability for partnerships. The telegram was immediately sent as follows: To the Honorable Legislative Yuan in Nanjing: It has been found that regarding the amendment of the regulations on joint and several liability for partnership debts, your esteemed Yuan has adopted the opinions of the national business community and separately formulated the Commercial Registration Law to remedy this. However, because the draft was submitted in October of the 23rd year [of the Republic], opinions could not be unified and it has been stalled until now. The business community's hope that the law can be passed and implemented soon has been like one day for several years. Even the so-called hope for clouds and rain cannot describe their eagerness. During this period, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce has sent three telegrams urging it and submitted two requests. At the same time, the joint associations of chambers of commerce in Shandong, Shanxi, and Hunan provinces, as well as the chambers of commerce in Qingdao, Yantai, Chongqing, Nanning, Chang'an, Guangzhou, Shantou, and other cities and counties, have also telegraphed your esteemed Yuan to quickly pass the draft so that it can become law and be used as a basis. In July of the 25th year, when the chambers of commerce of various provinces held a joint meeting in Shanghai to assist in anti-smuggling efforts, they also submitted a statement stating that the law urgently needs to be deliberated and implemented, and representatives were sent to the capital to present their case to your esteemed Yuan. In summary of the above, this matter has been stalled for two years and three months, which is not a short time. Those who have petitioned for an early deliberation are from various provinces, counties, and cities, and their expectations are not insignificant. However, to this day, there is still no news of the draft being submitted to the Yuan for deliberation, which is deeply worrying. This time, the chambers of commerce were invited by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to study income tax matters and attended the meeting in Shanghai. They all believe that the draft is an important law related to the issue of merchant debt liability. According to the principle of "initiative" in the four powers, your esteemed Yuan has the responsibility to adapt to the needs of the people and formulate the law when the people need a certain law. Moreover, according to the document that your esteemed Yuan sent to the Executive Yuan in the 23rd year, it said that according to the review report, Article 681 of the Civil Code Debt Compilation does not need to be amended, and the Commercial Registration Law can be formulated separately for partnership organizations as a remedy. Since the Yuan has expressed this opinion to the outside world, the deliberation and implementation of the law is tantamount to the entire intention of the legislative body, and it is not appropriate to shelve the case for a long time, which would be tantamount to changing the Yuan's opinion. It is also found that in recent years, commercial liquidation cases have all been affected by joint and several liability, so those who should be responsible according to their shares are also avoiding and seeking to escape. Therefore, creditors have no recourse, and cases that are satisfactorily resolved are few and far between. If liability can be borne according to shares, then the debts will be lighter due to individual sharing, and those who know how to value themselves will definitely be willing to stand up. The creditor's gains will be more than those who strictly enforce joint and several liability. Things are the opposite, but they complement each other, so it cannot be viewed superficially. The representatives of the chambers of commerce represent the business community and have true knowledge and insights into the pros and cons of this matter. They have no choice but to repeatedly petition your esteemed Yuan in order to implement the original intention of the petition over the years. It is reasonable to telegraph your esteemed Yuan for review and approval, and to grant the draft for immediate deliberation and implementation, which is in the public interest. Hangzhou City Chamber of Commerce, Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, Jiangyin County Chamber of Commerce, Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce, Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, Changshu County Chamber of Commerce, Qingpu County Chamber of Commerce, Kunshan County Chamber of Commerce, Fengxian County Chamber of Commerce, Shaoxing County Chamber of Commerce, Yixing County Chamber of Commerce, Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, Jiaxing County Chamber of Commerce, representatives attending the Income Tax Research Association, and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce respectfully request.</p>
<h3>The Income Tax Research Association Closed Last Night</h3>
<p>Representatives of Chambers of Commerce from Various Regions Say Goodbye</p>
<p>The Income Tax Research Association convened by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce held a public banquet for accountant Xu Yongzuo at noon yesterday. At 3:00 PM, the meeting continued, and accountants Pan Xulun, Xi Yushu, and Li Wenjie were invited to give speeches. It closed at 6:00 PM. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Grand Banquet at Noon</p>
<p>At 12:00 noon, representatives from various chambers of commerce and industry associations in Shanghai, as well as company representatives, held a public banquet for accountant Xu Yongzuo on the seventh floor of the New Asia Hotel. 145 representatives attended, with Qian Sunqing, Gu Suming, and Wang Jiean presiding. During the banquet, the chairman gave a speech, expressing deep gratitude to accountant Xu for attending the research association and providing guidance and explanations. Chen Ziyi, a representative from the bean and rice industry, gave a speech on behalf of the industry associations in Shanghai, thanking him and reporting on the industry's unified accounting books. Next, Xu Yongzuo gave a reply, explaining the accountant's mission and expressing his hopes: ㊀ Chambers of commerce in various regions should organize special committees on income tax to continue research; ㊁ Chambers of commerce in various regions should organize accounting committees to discuss gradual improvements to accounting bookkeeping methods. Next, Yan Esheng stated the good impressions gained from this research association and reported that the organization of industrial and commercial enterprises has become increasingly sound in recent years, and the relationship between industry and commerce and the state has become increasingly close. The interpretation of various industrial and commercial laws and regulations often has a direct or indirect impact on industrial and commercial enterprises. After the implementation of income tax, there will inevitably be more interpretations and approvals in the future, which requires attention. He is currently launching "Knowledge of Industrial and Commercial Laws and Regulations," which will interpret and publish various interpretations of commercial law, commerce, commercial affairs, trademarks, organization of merchant groups, and various tax laws, as found in various gazettes and official documents, and distribute them to various industrial and commercial institutions, groups, companies, and merchants for research and reference. It is expected to be realized within three months. At that time, he hopes that the representatives will provide guidance. Finally, the presidium representatives presented Mr. Xu with a silver tripod with the words "Show Me the Way," and added the following: "In January of the 26th year [of the Republic], the chambers of commerce of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the industry associations of Shanghai responded to the invitation of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to open an Income Tax Research Association. Accountant Xu Yongzuo was selected as an expert to preside over the research. He analyzed the gains and losses of the tax system in detail and pointed out the key points, which greatly benefited the merchants. Out of gratitude, we write this and present it to him." After the banquet, a commemorative photo was taken in the New Asia Garden.</p>
<p>Lecture Conference</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, the Income Tax Lecture Conference was held, with 142 representatives attending, with Ke Ganzhen presiding and Ye Zhizhong recording. First, the chairman gave a speech, briefly stating that the results of this research association were very satisfactory. The task from now on is for the chambers of commerce in various regions to work together, on the one hand, to lead merchants and explain the meaning of income tax, and on the other hand, to request the government to amend the regulations to avoid "harshness," so that the implementation will not become a "disturbance." As for the issues that were not discussed or were not discussed in detail due to time constraints, the chamber of commerce should form a special committee and hire experts to continue the research. Next, accountants Xi Yushu, Pan Xulun, and Li Wenjie gave speeches successively. ㊀ Mr. Xi briefly said that what he wanted to discuss was the relationship between income tax and accounting. He now offers three points for discussion. First, establish a simple accounting system. Everyone here knows that the accounting department is simple and not very complicated. However, given the vastness of China, I am afraid that there are many who do not understand this subject very well. We can close the door and talk frankly. Chinese accounts have always been considered unpublishable because they have never been published. Because they have never been published, the accounting skills and the completeness of the account books have not been well studied. Even in Shanghai, not to mention the accounting system, some merchants simply do not have account books and only rely on a handwritten booklet. Accounting is out of the question. Now that the government is implementing income tax, because we usually pay too little attention to accounting, many people will naturally feel troubled. The first urgent task at present is to establish an accounting system and reorganize the unreasonable accounts of the past. If you want to continue with a muddled account, refuse to publish it, and do not want to reorganize it, then you will suffer when paying taxes. But how should the reorganization plan be done? How should we start the reorganization? We should request the Ministry of Finance to convene accounting experts and scholars to formulate the simplest and most definite accounting system for the whole country to adopt. Because I advocate that we must first make the people understand how to do the accounts before we can understand how to pay taxes. Second, revise the simple declaration form. We request that the income tax authorities formulate a very simple declaration form. The one currently formulated, although very complete and detailed, cannot be universally understood by most people. Regarding this point, because the Chinese people do not study accounting subjects very much, it can be said to be a serious problem. Now that the new tax system is being implemented, the collecting authorities can only be lenient in inspection and punishment, otherwise the people will often violate the law and be punished. In reality, the people are not intentionally violating the law and are definitely not knowingly violating the law. I think the government certainly does not want the people to violate the law due to a lack of understanding of the method of paying taxes, and at the same time does not want the people to mistakenly recognize good taxes as bad taxes. Third, regarding the issue of accounting inspection, we have also mostly neglected the issue of accounting inspection in the past. Now we should determine our respective internal accounting inspection work. We can see in the newspapers every day that companies and merchants are going bankrupt. If we explore the reasons, it is by no means a simple business failure. Various errors and frauds occur mostly because accounting is unreasonable and not on the right track. In general, merchants are profitable on the surface at the end of the year, but there are many accounts payable that have not been paid out, and in general, shareholders do not ask about the business's profits and losses, but only seek to receive official interest at the end of the year. As a result, many intentional frauds follow. This is all the result of not paying attention to internal accounting inspection at ordinary times. We should often inspect it in the future to ensure that the records on the books are consistent with the actual situation of the business. When the accounts are clear, we will have a standard for paying taxes, and accounting will be determined and the account books will be complete, which will definitely increase the belief of the outside world. Our accounting business is not passive, it is not just like a doctor diagnosing a disease. We hope that society will allow us to check our health before we get sick, and no longer seek treatment after we get sick. Everyone should find ways to maintain health and increase health. We must wait until the time of declaring bankruptcy and liquidation to find us. This is really not the original intention of our accountants' business. ㊁ Mr. Pan briefly said that what I want to contribute is a general review of the resolutions of your meeting. According to the newspaper reports, the results of the research of your association in recent days are mostly in line with the opinions of the colleagues in the office. (Omitted) Now I will discuss and supplement a few points worth discussing with you. ㊀ Regarding the case of retaining the cash basis accounting system for store bookkeeping, your association decided that "this association has clear regulations in Articles 90 and 2 of the first category of collection guidelines," and it seems unnecessary to discuss it. My opinion is that in the United States, which is the most developed in the implementation of income tax, its history shows that the implementation of the accrual basis (i.e., the accrual basis) was delayed until more than 50 years later before it was legally permitted. Because the advancement of accounting knowledge has not been popularized and the accounting system has not been universally improved, it is originally impossible to expect most people to adopt the accrual basis to force its profit and loss calculation of accumulated cases. Therefore, my opinion is that the accounting system mentioned in the income tax laws and regulations of our country should follow the American method, allowing taxpayers to choose their own system. The cash basis is acceptable, and the accrual basis is also acceptable. However, once adopted, it is not allowed to be changed arbitrarily, and it is not necessary to obtain the permission of the competent authority when changing. This will maximize the benefits of promotion and avoid abuses. ㊁ Article 12, Paragraph 3 of the first category of collection guidelines, free donations cannot be regarded as necessary and reasonable expenses and losses in business. Your association advocates that free donations should exclude public welfare and charitable donations (such as donations for purchasing machines and celebrating birthdays). However, for example, merchants' social entertainment, gifts, and banquets are neither charitable nor public welfare. These kinds of social entertainment have the hope of increasing business income. The distinction between various expenses that are unrelated to the business is very cumbersome. This work, I think, can be entrusted to the review committee, because it cannot be determined by the provisions. Therefore, the third paragraph is amended to "free donations that are unrelated to the business." ㊂ Your association's resolution has a petition to the Ministry of Finance to add "reasonable prediction of bad debt losses" in Article 19 of the asset valuation method. My opinion is that these two cannot be mentioned in the same breath. The forecast and separate estimation methods can only be used one of them, and they can never be used at the same time. Assuming that the two methods are used together, the separate estimation can be taken for less on the books, and the separate estimation can be abandoned and the forecast can be taken for more on the books, which opens the door to trickery and seems to be worth discussing. ㊃ Your association's resolution has "goodwill is business rights, which has been stipulated in Article 13 of the asset valuation method, and it seems unnecessary to discuss it." My opinion is that Article 13 of the asset valuation method stipulates that business rights are ten years and copyrights are seven years, which is too rigid. Among the copyrights in our country, those with permanent value, such as the Analects of Confucius and Mencius, are of infinite value. How can they be limited to ten years? It is also very common for companies and merchants to establish contracts for less than ten years. The law must take into account the facts. This point is also requested that the review committee be responsible for determining goodwill. ㊄ Your association's resolution has "a petition to the Ministry of Finance to amend Article 12, Paragraph 2 of the first category of collection guidelines, deleting the nine characters "associate manager and other employees." My opinion is that this case is certainly very good from the perspective of reducing the burden on taxpayers. However, from a theoretical point of view, since taxation is based on individual character and the income from profits is based on industrial and commercial institutions as independent units, the benefits distributed by the associate manager are also included in the tax because the personality is different. ㊅ Your association's agenda has "the implementation of income tax" should immediately stop business tax to show fairness and avoid double taxation." My opinion is that this should be proposed at the same time as the salt tax that the general public cannot afford and the export tax that hinders export trade, and a request should be made to abolish them. We believe that good taxes, whether direct taxes or local taxes, should be promoted and bad taxes should be abolished. (Omitted) ㊂ Mr. Li briefly said ㊀ The income tax currently implemented in our country adopts a classified tax system. In the United Kingdom, an integrated tax system is adopted. The so-called integration is to comprehensively calculate and levy taxes from all aspects. The procedures are certainly more troublesome, but the result is a fair burden. The interim regulations are classified as very complicated, but the integrated system cannot be implemented immediately. I mean that at least the legal text must add additional tax methods. This is not the burden of the general class. At this time of serious national crisis, those who are rich should fulfill more tax obligations, right? ㊁ The interim regulations do not tax real estate. The legislative authorities' reason is that the countryside is bankrupt and the cities are declining, and they cite the Land Law, which imposes a large burden on land price tax. In fact, from a legal point of view, the land tax collection method is the opposite of income tax, because the legislative principle of the Land Law is based on the principle of the people's livelihood, equalizing land rights and encouraging people to use them. The land tax collection regulations of the Land Law stipulate that the tax rate for municipal wasteland is 30/1000 to 100/1000 of the fixed land price, the tax rate for rural wasteland is 15/1000 to 100/1000, the tax rate for municipal unimproved land is 15/1000 to 30/1000, the tax rate for rural unimproved land is 12/1000 to 15/1000, the tax rate for municipal improved land is 10/1000 to 20/1000, and the tax rate for rural improved land is 10/1000. This is contrary to the principle of income tax, which is to pay more for more and must pay. Now the wasteland donation collected in this city is also the same reason for encouraging people to use it. Therefore, the non-collection of income tax on real estate cannot be based on the Land Law. Currently, the Land Law has not been implemented, so the large landlords can enjoy tax exemption, which seems too unfair. ㊂ The investigation and review articles stipulated in Chapter 4 of the interim regulations are too complicated. For example, if a taxpayer is dissatisfied with the notice of the amount of tax payable determined by the competent collection agency, he may request a review within 20 days. If he is dissatisfied with the review, he may request the review committee to determine it within 10 days. If he is still dissatisfied, he may file an administrative appeal or lawsuit. It is really necessary to advocate reducing the trouble of turning around. ㊃ The depreciation rate calculation table of the asset valuation method attached to the first category of collection guidelines is a specialized technical table, including eight regulations on depreciation years. I think that although there is flexibility, it cannot be fully utilized. It seems that the minimum limit can be further reduced. For example, building a house on rented land, signing a contract for 25 years, and completely handing it over to the landowner upon expiration. There are no corresponding regulations on how to calculate the depreciation method. In addition, houses and machinery are advancing with the times and should be clearly stated. The calculation table takes the enumeration method and lacks flexibility, and should be remedied. (Omitted)</p>
<p>Representatives Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>Representatives of the chambers of commerce from various regions came to Shanghai on the 19th of this month. The research association closed yesterday, a total of seven days. After the closing, the chambers of commerce of Zhenjiang, Jiaxing, Wujin, and other places left Shanghai that night. It is heard that after the representatives return to their original counties, they will convene meetings of the chambers of commerce in various places to report on the research results, form special committees, continue to study, and schedule a second research meeting in March or April if necessary.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Symposium of the International Problems Research Association</h3>
<p>Director of the External Intelligence Department, Li Dijun, Speaks on the Diplomatic Situation of the Past Year</p>
<p>The International Problems Research Association held a symposium at the Bankers' Association yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, and invited Li Dijun, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to speak. More than 50 members of the association and representatives from various universities attended, including He Bingsong, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, Huang Renzhi, Zhu Shaoping, Shou Jingwei, and Dai Baoliu. A Central News Agency reporter recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>First, Liu Zhanen, Chairman of the International Problems Research Association, gave an opening speech, stating that the association was reorganized from the Liaison Committee of the Local Maintenance Association after the January 28th Incident. Considering the importance of international issues, no less than national defense and economic issues, it has aroused great attention from the people. Today, we specially invite representatives from all sectors of education in the city to hold a symposium to explore diplomatic issues. Currently, the most attention-grabbing issues are the Sino-Japanese issue, the Sino-Soviet issue, and what diplomatic methods our country should adopt with the great powers and the League of Nations. I hope that everyone will express their valuable opinions and study together. Now, I would like to invite Director Li to speak, so that we may use it as a basis for our research.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's Speech</p>
<p>After Chairman Liu Zhanen's opening speech, Li Dijun, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stood up to speak. He first gave a detailed analysis of the various so-called ways out for Chinese diplomacy, such as the so-called Tokyo route, Moscow route, and Geneva route. Next, he reported on the diplomatic situation of our country in the past year, with particular emphasis on Sino-Japanese relations, Sino-Soviet relations, and China's relations with the League of Nations. Furthermore, based on the diplomatic situation of the past year, he speculated on the future diplomatic trends of China, stating that: ❶ China's diplomacy, due to the increase in national strength, has gradually reached a stage of autonomy and initiative, with a clear and firm stance, adhering to it unswervingly. ❷ China's current stage of diplomacy is multilateral diplomacy, not limited to any country or any group, trying to adjust diplomatic relations with Japan through normal diplomatic channels, while supporting the League of Nations, maintaining international peace, and promoting international cooperation. On the other hand, maintaining and enhancing friendly relations with the Soviet Union and European and American countries, in preparation for further cooperation when necessary. Finally, he said that diplomacy and domestic affairs have an inseparable relationship. One point of national strength increases, and diplomacy also increases accordingly. With strength, there is a way to handle diplomacy, and any path can be taken. Without strength, no path can be taken. The people of the country should unite sincerely, strive for survival through their own efforts, and not harbor any侥倖 psychology.</p>
<p>Mr. Shou's Speech</p>
<p>Subsequently, Shou Jingwei, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, gave a speech on "The Formation of Pan-Asianism and the East Asian Economic Group." In today's situation where Sino-Japanese relations are intermittent, all issues of economic cooperation and cultural cooperation are out of the question. A further East Asian economic group seems like a futile dream and will hardly become a reality. However, for the sake of the permanent interests of both China and Japan, economic cooperation, if based on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, is not only possible in fact, but also necessary for the survival and development of the two major nations of China and Japan. As for the organization and promotion of the East Asian economic group, China and Japan should jointly shoulder the responsibility. The economic policies of the two countries should naturally take the maintenance of their own national interests as the fundamental principle, but within the maximum possible scope, both sides should also try to avoid conflicts of interest in industry or trade. All forms of aggressive cooperation and submissive cooperation are no longer compatible with the spirit of the times, and major obstacles that hinder the permanent interests of economic cooperation between the two countries should be removed in appropriate ways. He who tied the bell must untie it. We cannot but hope for the far-sighted and well-managed Japanese authorities. As early as 1924, Mr. Sun Yat-sen advocated Pan-Asianism for Asian countries, and said that the thorough abolition of unequal treaties concluded by Japan with European and American countries could be regarded as the beginning of the rejuvenation of all Asian nations, and he placed his hopes on Japan with enthusiastic sympathy for supporting China's abolition of unequal treaties. Now, ten years have passed, and China's political economy has made considerable progress. Recently, Chairman Chiang was able to move with utmost sincerity in the Xi'an Incident, making the foundation of the country safe again. The opportunity for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation can no longer be suppressed by any force. The time is now. The fundamental adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations must be realized through diplomatic and military strategies in extraordinary times. It is hoped that the Japanese government's policy towards China can have a epoch-making transformation. As for the constituent elements of the East Asian economic group, China and Japan each have their own special positions, and other weaker nations should also have their due status. The current world economic organization has a new trend of overall control. Our country's economic policy should also aim at a controlled economy, and implement Mr. Sun's great industrial plan with an active and independent spirit and a sound and complete organization. The economic group of East Asian countries should take the common and permanent interests of all nations as its basis. Although it is still questionable whether the formation of this economic group can be gradually promoted by peaceful means to achieve the final goal, the safety of the overall situation in East Asia is at stake, and the people of insight in both China and Japan should give it deep and detailed consideration. Whether it is for co-existence and co-prosperity, or for mutual destruction, the choice of gains and losses is not only the natural duty of the governments of the two countries, but also the understanding that the people of the two countries should have.</p>
<p>Discussion</p>
<p>After the speech, the chairman, taking Mr. Li's speech as the center, invited the attendees to freely express their opinions. Those who stood up to speak included Lin Kanghou, He Bingsong, Gui Zhongshu, Shou Jingwei, Geng Danru, Lin Die, Meng Zhi, and many representatives from Guanghua, Daxia, Soochow, and St. John's universities. Their eloquent speeches were very impressive. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. That evening at 7:30 PM, the International Problems Research Association held a banquet at the Bankers' Association to welcome Director Li. The atmosphere was very cheerful, and the banquet ended at 9:00 PM.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Implements Austerity Measures, Laying Off Over a Thousand Road Workers</h3>
<p>Workers Panic, Submit Petitions to the Party and Government, and Send Representatives to Various Parties to Plead</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, there are more than 1,200 road construction workers in the Public Concession's Municipal Council. Recently, due to the Council's implementation of cost-saving measures, it was announced that nine-tenths of the workers would be laid off by the end of this month. Upon hearing this news, the workers were panic-stricken. Yesterday, they sent representatives to various agencies and groups to plead for assistance. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Submitting Petitions to the Party and Government</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 1,200 road construction workers of the Municipal Council sent representatives to jointly petition the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, the General Labor Union, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and other agencies and groups, requesting assistance. The petition stated: "We are petitioning regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession implementing austerity measures and laying off workers, requesting relief. We have been working in the Transportation Group of the Public Concession's Municipal Council for one or two decades. Regardless of the wind and snow or the scorching sun, we have been working diligently. At the same time, there are those who have sacrificed their lives to be loyal to their work. However, the price we pay for our labor and lives is not enough to support our families, so we are already lingering on, living each day like a year. Now, the Municipal Council has suddenly implemented a policy of austerity measures and laying off workers, wanting to dismiss all Chinese workers by drawing lots, leaving only about one-tenth. This will be implemented on the 30th of this month. Upon hearing this news, we cannot help but be terrified. At the beginning of the opening of the concession, the four lands were desolate and the population was sparse. In recent years, the roads have been widened and the number of vehicles has increased. In fact, there is a need to add workers, not reduce them. If a large number of workers are innocently dismissed due to market problems, how can we bear it? This kind of austerity measures not only declares our entire workforce unemployed, but also causes our families to starve. It is unreasonable and illegal. Moreover, we have served faithfully and diligently, without any unprincipled or illegal behavior, and to dismiss us without reason is not allowed even by international public law. Therefore, we specially ask you to uphold justice and handle the negotiations, and hope that the Council will withdraw its decision in order to stabilize the people's livelihood. This would be a virtue."</p>
<p>Representatives Plead</p>
<p>Yesterday, dozens of road construction workers of the Municipal Council, including representatives Li Jingchun, Liu Huanwen, Huan Buying, Li Binggao, Tao Shizhi, Shen Zhongyuan, Bian Desheng, Cai Furong, Wang Lisheng, and Wang Shuangcai, took their petitions to the Citizens' Union of the First Special District at 1:00 PM. Committee member Chen Jiufeng received them and agreed to assist with the workers' request. Then, they went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to petition, where Secretary Tao Leqin received them and agreed to submit the petition to the chairman and committee members for review. Finally, they went to the General Labor Union, the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other agencies to petition, requesting assistance.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Workers from Japanese Textile Factories United to Petition but Were Blocked</h3>
<p>Demanding that the Council Negotiate for Reinstatement</p>
<p>The workers of Japanese textile factories such as Toyota in western Shanghai, who were laid off after the last workers' strike, totaled about two hundred. At 9:00 AM yesterday, they gathered on Zhongshan Road and walked to the Social Affairs Bureau in the city center to petition, demanding negotiations for reinstatement. When they reached Gonghe Road in Zhabei, they were stopped by police officers, who ordered them to send representatives. The workers refused, causing a disturbance. They were then dispersed by the police officers.</p>
<h3>The Tea Industry Delegation to Japan Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Releasing a Written Statement Detailing the Inspection Process</p>
<p>Our country's tea industry delegation to Japan, consisting of Hong Chunzhi, Song Qifan, Li Naichang, Ning Weiting, Tao Zhensheng, Hu Yezhi, and Secretary Yu Gumin, totaling seven people, departed from Shanghai on the 6th of this month and has completed the inspection. They returned to the country from Kobe on the Nagasaki Maru of the Japanese Postal Steamship Company on the 22nd, arriving at the Osaka Wharf in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Those who went to the wharf to welcome them included Ye Shichang, chairman of the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Trade Association, as well as more than 50 representatives from Xielong, Zhenhe, and other tea warehouses and tea merchants, including Zhu Yanqing and Chen Yizhou, all holding welcome banners. After the delegation landed, they took cars to the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Trade Association in Gujia Lane, Beijing Road, to rest.</p>
<p>Releasing a Statement</p>
<p>The delegation released a written statement on the ship yesterday, stating: "This time, we went to Japan to inspect the tea industry, spending a short period of time traveling to Nagasaki, Kobe, Tokyo, Shizuoka, Kyoto, Osaka, and other places. We received guidance from Ambassador Xu and Commercial Counselor, hospitality from the embassy staff and local consuls, and introductions from the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai and the Tokyo Japan-China Society. We were able to approach various Japanese tea industry organizations and fully visit tea gardens and tea factories, obtaining detailed inspections. The overall impression was very good. The boundaries between agriculture, industry, and commerce in the Japanese tea industry are very clear. The Japanese government provides full assistance to the positions of tea farmers, tea factories, and tea merchants. At the same time, those engaged in the tea industry, whether they are tea farmers, tea factories, or tea merchants, have great trust in the government. Therefore, the organization and management of the tea industry has a solid system, in an orderly manner. The people of that country are also very concerned about our country's tea industry. Even the inherent strengths of our country's tea industry are not necessarily maintained and adopted. According to the director of the central conference of the tea industry association, the highest tea industry authority in that country, the Japanese tea industry is currently adopting a division of labor and cooperation system, so that tea farmers are tea farmers, tea factories are tea factories, and tea merchants are tea merchants. The more detailed the division of labor, the better. Moreover, the people who run the tea industry are guided administratively by the various conferences of the tea industry association. The government separately establishes a tea industry research institute and experimental field to study improved methods of planting and manufacturing for tea farmers, tea factories, and tea merchants to adopt. It can be seen that various Japanese industries are trending towards scientification. Looking at their organizational methods, our country cannot help but be far behind in comparison. A detailed report of the delegation's inspection will be disclosed after it is sorted out."</p>
<p>Association Welcome</p>
<p>At 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, members of the Yangzhuang Tea Industry Trade Association welcomed all members of the tea industry delegation to Japan and their secretary at the association's auditorium in Gujia Lane, Beijing Road. More than 30 representatives from more than ten companies, including Xielong Tea Warehouse, including Zhu Yanqing, attended. Chairman Ye Shichang delivered a welcome speech, saying: "In order to improve our country's tea industry manufacturing and develop the foreign trade of Chinese tea, we specially organized a delegation to inspect Japan. Now they have returned to Shanghai. I hope that they will contribute what they have learned from the inspection to our members, so as to serve as a reference for tea industry improvement." Then, delegate Hong Chunzhi gave a brief report. The event ended at around 5:00 PM. As for the detailed report, it is currently being sorted out.</p>

<h3>The China Manila Pilgrimage Group, Including Lu Bohong, Departs This Morning</h3>
<p>— Photo by Wang Kai</p>
<p>Lu Appointed as Attendant Minister of the Papal Envoy, Enthusiastic Farewell at the Wharf Last Night from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>The Catholic Church will hold the International Eucharistic Congress in Manila, Philippines, on February 3, with more than 200,000 participants praying for world peace. In addition to the special envoy sent by the Pope to preside over the ceremony, various countries have sent representatives to participate. Our country was specially commissioned by Archbishop Cai Ning, Chairman of the General Assembly of the Chinese Catholic Action Association, Lu Bohong, to organize the pilgrimage group, which will be divided into two batches. The first batch has already departed yesterday, led by Mr. Lu, on the German steamer Bosteden. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Lu Bohong Lu Yingen</h3>
<p>Number of Group Members</p>
<p>The first batch of departing group members includes Bishop Zhu of Haimen, Bishop Gu of Yichang, Bishop Yang of Jinan, Bishop Shi of Xinyang, Bishop Dai of Ningbo, Bishop Wang of Zhumadian, Bishop Shu of Yanzhou, Bishop Tian of Yanggu, Bishop Shi of Liaoning, Bishop He of Caozhou, and others, as well as Dean Leng, Father Mei, Xu Zongze, Ding Rucheng, Zhang Weiping, Jiang Daoyuan, Zhu Minghao, Liu Shunqin, Wen Huaji, Zhu Zhiyao, Liu Changyin, Liu Fuchu, Lai Rongsheng, Mei Boqiao, Shen Qiaoxun, and Mr. Lu's daughters Lu Zengzuo, Lu Deyi, and his three daughters-in-law Lu Guo, Lu Liu, Liu Xiuzhen, and more than a hundred other people.</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage Group Taking Photos on Board (Photo by Wang Kai)</h3>
<p>Departure Situation</p>
<p>All group members gathered at the Datong Wharf at 3:00 PM in the afternoon, and then set off in formation, with the national flag and the Pope's flag leading the way, followed by the Zhengxiu Middle School music team and primary and middle school students. Group members took cars, and those who participated in the farewell included leaders of various churches, priests, representatives of various district public advancement associations, Datong Shipping Company, China Electric Company, Chongming Shipping Company, and representatives from St. Heart Hospital, Xin Puyu Hall, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, and others, totaling six or seven hundred people. Along the way, Wang Hong and Wang Er, special photographers sent by the Central Photography Studio to Manila, filmed newsreels. Group members arrived at the wharf and boarded the Chongming Company's special ship Tianyou, which was decorated with flags and slogans. At 4:00 PM, amidst music and firecrackers, the ship left the port and headed straight for the Bosteden. Mr. Lu and others shook hands with the farewell personnel. It is reported that the ship will set sail this morning.</p>
<p>Receiving New Orders</p>
<p>It is reported that the group leader, Lu Bohong, is a newly appointed Papal Knight of the Sword and Robe, and he is bringing the full dress with him to thank the Papal Envoy in person. The leader, Lu Yingen, was recently awarded the Papal Golden Cross Medal and will also thank the Papal Envoy in person. Mr. Lu has also been appointed by the Holy See as the Attendant Minister of the Papal Envoy of this International Eucharistic Congress and will live in the Quezon Presidential Palace.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's Remarks</p>
<p>The reporter met group leader Lu Bohong on board and was pleased to hear his remarks. The main idea was that the International Eucharistic Congress is of global nature, and its sacredness, greatness, solemnity, and grandeur break any gathering record. The Holy Body being welcomed is the true master of heaven, earth, gods, and all things, the King of Kings, and the Lord of Lords. We humans are all creatures, and in front of the True Lord, we are as small as dust and dirt. Therefore, at each Congress, leaders from all countries must participate, expressing their pain, repentance, humility, and self-preservation. This time, the Manila event is the first grand event in the Far East. Although I am at the end of the year and have many secular affairs, I will also go to participate. In addition to praying for world peace, I will also pray especially for China, so that the Holy Church will flourish and the nation will be revived. Also, Lu Yingen, the leader of the preparations for this pilgrimage, also shared his remarks, stating briefly that he was fortunate to be the leader of the 1933 Rome pilgrimage, and this time he was again appointed as the leader of the Manila pilgrimage. He will guide his fellow travelers under the guidance of the captain and deputy captains, using his previous experiences abroad. It is estimated that the Philippines has tens of millions of Catholics, accounting for 80% of the country's population, almost becoming a Catholic country. We are going there to pray for our motherland, so that the Holy Church will spread widely and the number of Catholics will gradually increase. The International Eucharistic Congress will have a day to be held in China. After the affairs in the Philippines are completed, I will go to Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangdong to inspect charity, education, and industry.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, the Workers in the Ivory and Bone Utensil Industry Petitioned After the Strike</h3>
<p>Forming a Famine Strike Group and Insisting to the End, Vowing Not to Resume Work Until the Goal is Achieved</p>
<p>More than 3,000 workers in the ivory and bone utensil industry in this city, because a small number of capitalists refused to implement a unified wage, caused a total strike the day before yesterday. In addition to making six demands, they also decided to petition the Party and government agencies. At 10:00 AM yesterday, the workers sent Yang Guoliang and Li Kaiyi to lead more than a hundred workers to the Shanghai General Labor Union to petition. Fang Rusheng of the General Labor Union received them and agreed to accept the workers' demands, send personnel to investigate, and then review the matter. Then, they went to the Shanghai Municipal Party Committee in Fenglin Bridge to petition, where Wu Wenbang, a cadre of the Civil Movement Section of the Municipal Party Committee, received them. He promised to forward the petition to the Municipal Executive Committee for instructions and review, and advised the workers to strictly observe order and wait quietly for the resolution. The workers originally planned to petition the Social Affairs Bureau again, but due to lack of time, it was rescheduled for today. They then convened a representative conference at Jishan Temple in Nanshi, attended by more than 400 people. Wang Fugen was publicly elected as chairman. After the ceremony, the chairman reported on the petition process, and then discussed various cases, listing: ❶ Advising all workers to strictly abide by discipline and wait quietly for the Party and government agencies to mediate according to the law. ❷ Not to work privately before the matter is resolved, and those who violate the strike discipline will be regarded as traitors and running dogs. ❸ All workers vowed not to resume work until the victory goal is achieved. ❹ Organizing the Shanghai Ivory and Bone Utensil Industry Workers' Famine Strike Group, and starting registration immediately. ❺ A resolution was passed on the proposal to request assistance from all walks of life, and a letter to all walks of life was published.

After the ceremony, the chairman first reported on the purpose of the meeting and the recent situation of the union, and then began the discussion. Important proposals listed: ❶ Regarding the refusal of a small number of capitalists to implement a unified wage, which has evolved into a labor unrest, and the striking workers requesting assistance from the union, how should it be carried out? It was resolved: (1) Accept the workers' demands. (2) Submit a request to the Party and government agencies to mediate quickly. ❷ The striking workers requested the union to send personnel to lead the workers to petition the Municipal Party Committee, the Social Affairs Bureau, and the Shanghai General Labor Union. It was resolved to appoint Yang Guoliang and Li Kaiyi to lead the workers to petition. ❸ The union issued a notice advising the workers to strictly observe order and not take any excessive actions.</p>

<p>And Welcomed Sun Shixiong's Return to the Country</p>
<p>Xu Kai, Chief Engineer of the Huai River Guidance Committee, is going to Europe at the invitation of the League of Nations to discuss water conservancy technology issues. At the same time, Lei Hongji and Chen Zhiding are also going to Europe and the United States on behalf of the Huai River Guidance Committee and the Jiangsu Provincial Government's Construction Department to inspect water conservancy projects.

<h3>A Japanese Marine Was Cursed by a British Man</h3>
<p>Japanese Residents Believe It Was an Insult</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun, at 6:30 PM on the 24th, a British man, passing by Old Bazizi Road, saw a Japanese marine standing guard on the road and loudly scolded "Bastard pig." The Japanese soldier heard the sound and rushed to the British man to question him. This was seen by an officer from the Hongkou Department of the Municipal Council, who took the British man and the marine to the Japanese military police station on Zhaopu Road, and then to the Hongkou Patrol Room. Because the British man was drunk and gave irrelevant answers, the Japanese residents believed that the foreigner insulted the Japanese and urged the authorities to fundamentally resolve the matter.</p>
<h3>The Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop Held a Fifth Anniversary Memorial for the Four Martyrs</h3>
<p>During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, members of the City Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Troop, including Luo Yunxiang and others, went deep into the war zone, served and died for the country. The Boy Scout General Association and others built a memorial tower in the Chamber of Commerce and a clothing tomb in the Shanghai Public Cemetery in Jiangwan.

At that time, a reception will be set up in the Chamber of Commerce to receive guests from all walks of life. It is reported that boy scout troops from all over the city will send personnel to participate.</p>
<h3>The Yangtze River Rises Again, Ships Can Pass Through Xunhan</h3>
<p>For the past few days, the water level in the Yangtze River has dropped sharply, and large river ships of various companies have been blocked in Wuhu and unable to go upstream. All passengers and cargo destined for Jiujiang and Hankou have been transferred to barges in Wuhu. Upstream and downstream ships have often run aground, resulting in the Yangtze River being divided into two sections. Shanghai to Wuhu is unobstructed, and Wuhu to Hankou restricts the draft, preventing large ships from sailing upstream. This has caused the Yangtze River to be half-open and half-blocked. Although the shallow water fee has been increased, shipping companies are still suffering losses. Just as they were worried, it suddenly rained on the 23rd and 24th, and the water in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River rose sharply. Yesterday, the various shipping companies received telegrams stating that in the shallowest Xunhan section, the Jianghai Customs can limit loading to 11 feet, which is more than one foot higher than the water level on the 21st. Therefore, the upstream route is unobstructed. Shipping companies were delighted to receive the telegrams and ordered all river ships to sail to Xunhan as usual from yesterday.</p>
<h3>Money Trade Yesterday Opened Executive Committee Meeting, Announced Final Account Method</h3>

<h3>Lawyer Zhou Yu, et al., Accused of Fraud and Dereliction of Duty</h3>
<p>Conspiring to Establish a Retainer Agreement and Pursue Public Funds, Case Concluded by the Court Yesterday, Verdict to be Announced on the 29th</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhou Yu, courtesy name Xiaoci, from Yixing, Jiangsu, joined the Shanghai Bar Association as a member in March of the 12th year of the Republic (1923), with his office located at No. 214 Dahu Building, Nanjing Road. Recently, Mrs. Shen Ni, the wife of the owner of Yuanfeng Firewood Shop on Changan Road, Zhabei, through Lawyer Lu Xiangya, filed a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Special First District Court, accusing Lawyer Zhou Yu, along with Qian Bingzhang from Yixing, a liaison officer at Lawyer Wang Peiyuan's office at No. 30 Huaxing Lane, North Zhejiang Road, and Wu Chunbo, a partner of Yuanfeng Firewood Shop, of conspiring to commit fraud and dereliction of duty by taking advantage of their official positions. The reasons for the lawsuit stated that Mrs. Shen Ni had previously engaged Lawyer Huang Yiyan to handle a case of appeal against an execution objection with Dashang Bank. Later, Qian Bingzhang, a lawyer broker, while delivering documents, promoted Lawyer Zhou Yu, claiming that Lawyer Zhou was very ethical, and introduced him to handle the case, stating that the fees would be a split of 20% of any gains. However, after Lawyer Zhou took over the case, knowing that the execution was difficult, he secretly enticed Wu Chunbo, who had previously been the legal representative of the case, and Qian Bingzhang, etc., to conspire to commit fraud. Lawyer Zhou then ordered Wu Chunbo, an employee of the shop, to sign another retainer agreement, filling in a public fee of 400 yuan. In July, Zhou wrote to the firm demanding the 400 yuan fee but was unsuccessful, so he filed a lawsuit in court. Such behavior constitutes the crimes of dereliction of duty and fraud under Articles 134 and 339 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Fu Lin presided over the trial in Criminal Court No. 8. According to the plaintiff, Mrs. Shen Ni's statement of the past events, when questioned, the defendant, Lawyer Zhou Yu, denied the charges and filed a counterclaim for false accusation. The testimonies of Qian and Wu were unfavorable to the co-defendant Zhou Yu and contained mutual accusations. Judge Fu announced the conclusion of the debate in the case and scheduled the verdict to be announced on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Female Corpse in Wooden Box on Yuyuan Road Determined to be Strangled</h3>
<p>A Western Suit Tie Was Around the Neck, Forensic Examination Completed, Body Handed Over to Charitable Organization for Burial</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 23rd of this month, workers from the Xinxiangji Construction Factory discovered a wooden box containing a female corpse while excavating the garden at No. 40, Lane 608, Yuyuan Road. The corpse had already undergone adipocere transformation. After reporting the discovery, the Jing'an Temple Police ordered Detective Ni Jiafeng and others to investigate and transported the body to the forensic examination center on Feilun Road to await examination. The details of the case have already been reported in the newspaper. Yesterday morning, Zhang Zongru, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and clerk Wang Zuyi, etc., arrived at the center. The examination revealed that the corpse was of a woman around thirty years old, with a Western suit tie around her neck. She was wearing a wool crepe cheongsam, with a red wool sweater and two white cotton short shirts underneath, white cotton blue striped single pants, and silk stockings. After dissection and examination by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, it was determined that she had been strangled to death. Prosecutor Zhang then declared that the unidentified female corpse had been strangled and secretly buried before death. The body was entrusted to the Pushan Villa for burial, and the Western suit tie was handed over to the police for investigation.</p>
<h3>Xue Xiangjie, Wife of Real Estate Merchant, Certified by Forensic Examination to Have Never Given Birth to Children</h3>
<p>Photos Showing Flat Abdomen Submitted as Evidence, Court Orders Conclusion of Debate, Verdict to be Announced Today</p>
<p>Xue Xiangjie, the wife of real estate merchant Xu Liangchen and daughter of the late dyestuff tycoon Xue Xianrun, has been married for over a decade but has never had children. Recently, Wang Yongquan, a former driver of the Xue family from Suzhou, along with his eighteen-year-old son Wang Genbao, through Lawyer Chen Wen, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Xue Xiangjie, requesting confirmation that Genbao is Xue's illegitimate son. The case has already been heard twice by the court, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xu Gongdian continued the hearing in Civil Court No. 7. The defendant,</p>
<p>Xue Xiangjie, still did not appear.</p>
<p>Lawyers You E'sen and Tang Shenpei represented her in court. The plaintiff's lawyer stated first that the witness, the second landlord of Taian Lane, was in his hometown, so his son appeared in court. The court ruled that there was no need to question him. Subsequently, Lawyer You presented a defense, stating that the plaintiff's claims were completely false. According to him, Genbao was born in February of the 8th year of the Republic (1919). On the eighth day of the twelfth month of the 7th year of the Republic (1918), Xue Yansheng, the defendant's younger brother, married the daughter of Bei Runsheng. The defendant also</p>
<p>participated in the photo taking</p>
<p>and in the photo, the sister-in-law standing next to the defendant (i.e., Xue Gansheng's wife) had a large belly and was pregnant. Gansheng's wife gave birth in March of the 8th year of the Republic (1919), one month later than the defendant. Logically, the defendant's abdomen should have been even larger than her sister-in-law's. However, observing the photo, one can only see the large belly of Xue Gansheng's wife, while the defendant's abdomen is flat. How could an eight or nine-month pregnancy not be visible? Furthermore, the defendant, in order to clarify the truth, had an examination performed by court forensic doctor Wei Ligong. According to his diagnosis, he believed that</p>
<p>the defendant had never given birth.</p>
<p>This is sufficient to prove that the plaintiff's claim is unreasonable and should be dismissed. The photos and medical certificate were then submitted to the court. The plaintiff's lawyer, Chen Wen, immediately responded, stating that at the time, the defendant had not yet married. If her abdomen was bulging, how would she dare attend a grand wedding ceremony? It is reasonable to assume that a bulging abdomen can be concealed externally, so one cannot determine whether she was pregnant based solely on a photo. Furthermore, the diagnosis certificate submitted by the defendant was</p>
<p>signed by a court forensic doctor,</p>
<p>which is undeniable. However, the defendant's procedure was not legal. The defendant should have appeared in court, and the court should have sent her to the forensic doctor for examination. If the person who went for the examination was not the defendant herself but someone else impersonating her, and the defendant had no special markings, how could Dr. Wei be sure that the person who went for the examination was indeed the defendant herself? Based on these reasons, the defendant's defense is difficult to accept. The court reviewed the report and announced the conclusion of the debate, scheduling the verdict to be announced at 9:00 AM today.</p>
<h3>Confirmation of Paternal-Son and Maternal-Son Relationships, Each Party Sticks to Their Story</h3>
<p>Zhang Xianlin Insists on Being the Father, Zhang Qin Chu Refuses to Be the Son</p>
<p>Zhang Xianlin, a 57-year-old from Hubei, resides at No. 183, South Railway Station Back Road, and works as a laborer on the railway. In the eighth month of the third year before the Republic (i.e., the first year of the Xuantong reign of the late Qing Dynasty), Zhang Antao's son died, and his widowed daughter-in-law, Zhang Wang, was only twenty years old at the time. She had an infant boy named Qin Chu. Therefore, with the help of Qi Jinxiang, he arranged for Zhang Qin Chu to marry into the family as a "filler son" (i.e., to prevent the family line from dying out). After marrying into the family, Zhang Qin Chu was able to fulfill his</p>
<p>duties of filling the lineage gap.</p>
<p>The following year, Zhang Antao died. In the 9th year of the Republic (1920), Zhang Antao's old wife, Zhang Shao, also passed away. Zhang Qin Chu also fulfilled his filial duties as a "filler son," raising his stepson Qin Chu, teaching him to study, and recommending him to the Commercial Press to learn a trade when he grew up. He is now an employee. On the ninth day of the sixth month of the 17th year of the Republic (1928), he helped Qin Chu get married. The so-called "preventing the extinction of the lineage" had already been maintained until a</p>
<p>time of fulfillment and maturity.</p>
<p>However, Zhang Xianlin and Zhang Wang are now old and weak, and they want Qin Chu to support them. Unexpectedly, Qin Chu turned against them and filed a lawsuit with the Local Court in October of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), demanding the return of Zhang family property deeds. Zhang Xianlin was furious and, together with Zhang Wang, hired Lawyer Xu Lin to sue Zhang Qin Chu in the Local Court, seeking confirmation of the paternal-son and maternal-son relationship, stating that Qin Chu was only one year old at the time and is now 30 years old, betraying 29 years of</p>
<p>nurturing kindness,</p>
<p>which is inhumane. Yesterday, Judge Yu opened the trial. Zhang Xianlin testified that he was a foreman at the South Railway Station and described the previous circumstances as mentioned above. When questioned, Zhang Qin Chu testified that he was 30 years old and lived at No. 160, South Railway Station Back Road. Zhang Xianlin and his family were only neighbors. He had an affair with my mother. After taking another man's wife, he now wants to force me to be his son. There is no such reason. There is no paternal-son relationship or obligation to support. Furthermore, my tuition fees were all paid by my maternal uncle, Wang Bingsheng. My family has</p>
<p>two acres of land</p>
<p>and a house and an ox, which were previously managed by my maternal uncle for three years and are now managed by me. It has nothing to do with the plaintiff. At this point, the plaintiff stated that his original surname was Chen. He married into the Zhang family as a "filler son" for Zhang Antao and was recognized as an adopted son. He presented evidence such as the gift list from Zhang Qin Chu's wedding, with Zhang Xianlin acting as the host, and a group photo. However, Qin Chu argued that the gift list and other items were forged and that the group photo was taken when they were playing together as children and cannot be used as evidence. One person insisted on being the father in court, while the other vehemently denied being the son. The court ordered the case to be adjourned for further questioning with witnesses.</p>
<h3>Yu Wencan, Director of the Health Bureau, Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Frustrated with Unsuccessful Affairs, Jumps from Building and Suffers Injuries, Dies in Hospital</p>
<p>Yu Wenshuo, a 55-year-old from Tianjin, resided at No. 75, Anshun Lane, Kangti Road in the French Concession. He was the director of the First Section of the Shanghai South Office of the Health Bureau for ten years. Recently, Yu had been frustrated with various unsuccessful affairs and became very disheartened. At 9:15 AM yesterday, he suddenly had thoughts of ending his life in the Shanghai South Office and jumped from the second floor in an attempt to commit suicide, falling into the atrium of the office. He suffered internal injuries and was discovered by his colleagues, who rushed him to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after. It is reported that Yu Wencan left behind a wife and a seven-year-old son. His family is very poor.</p>
<h3>Municipal Zoo Adds a Black Panther</h3>
<p>Domestic Rabbit Exhibition Plans Finalized</p>
<p>Director Shen of the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road, in order to promote rural sideline industries, has launched a domestic rabbit exhibition. The exhibition is scheduled to take place a few days after the Spring Festival. The exhibition and exhibit collection methods have been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for filing. Approval is expected soon. In addition to Hu Wenhu agreeing to seek out and donate a tiger, the zoo also plans to purchase a black panther this year. The zoo already has a pair of leopards. If the plan to purchase a black panther is realized, the yellow and black spots will further delight visitors.</p>
<h3>Eighteen Years of Cohabitation, Abandoned Overnight</h3>
<p>Tan Zhaohui Marries Another, Shi Minren Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Shi Minren, a woman from Haimen, is 35 years old. In her youth, she studied at Wanzhu Primary School and was very close to Tan Zhaohui. Later, as they grew older, their love blossomed, and eventually, without the need for matchmakers, they cohabitated freely. Time passed, and eighteen years have elapsed. They have a son who is now fourteen years old. However, Tan suddenly abandoned his beloved and married Du Hengru. A wedding ceremony was officially held at the New Asia Restaurant, and an advertisement was published to announce the marriage. From then on, Shi became an abandoned woman, and her son became like an orphan, facing great difficulties and without a livelihood. Shi has now learned that Tan resides in the Delin Apartment. She has hired a lawyer and filed a criminal complaint with the First Special District Local Court against Tan, according to Article 229 of the Criminal Law, requesting an investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiao opened the trial. The defendant, Tan Zhaohui, did not appear. His lawyer appeared in court and stated that Tan was away from Shanghai and requested a postponement. When questioned, the plaintiff, Shi Minren, testified that she and Tan cohabitated and had a son but did not marry. The court then informed her that since they had not held a wedding ceremony, her status was questionable. Shi's representative lawyer, upon hearing this, stated that although they had not bowed to heaven and earth in the past, they had bowed to the Kitchen God. The plaintiff's mother can come to court to prove this point in the future. Judge Xiao then ordered the trial to be rescheduled to the afternoon of February 3rd.</p>

<h3>Thirteen Robbers Who Plotted to Rob the French-Owned Water and Electricity Company Are on Trial</h3>
<p>Southern Motorist Testifies in Court, Recounts the Circumstances of the Robbers' Unsuccessful Robbery Attempt</p>
<p>French Concession Police Inspector Jiang Futian, Li Xianyang, and duty officers cracked the case of the thirteen robbers, Shen Zhaoyu, Liang Honggen, Liang Zhujiu, Qiu Rufu, Qiu Dingkuan, Tao Muxi, Wang Changxing, Jia Henghe, Liang Guofang, Wang Shaoting, Sun Youfa, Zhong Quansheng, and Xue Shiqing, who plotted to rob a large sum of wages from the French-owned Water and Electricity Company on the 9th of this month. A pistol and a Mauser pistol were confiscated, along with</p>
<p>nine bullets.</p>
<p>They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. The details of the investigation have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Sun Pengxian of the Second Special Court, along with clerk Tao Zongkan, continued the trial in Criminal Court No. 1. Lawyer Gu Shouxi of the Police Department stated that the Police Department's investigation of the case was not yet complete and requested a two-week extension. After briefly questioning each of the defendants, motorist Chen Nanxing, 39 years old, from Haimen, who works as a driver at the Broadway Branch No. 6 of the Southern Motor Company, was summoned as a witness. On the morning of the 9th of this month, two people</p>
<p>came to hire a car</p>
<p>saying they were going to Lujiawan Luban Road and back and paid a fare of two yuan. The accounts room ordered me to drive. The two passengers got in the car. I drove to the intersection of Kangti Road. One passenger got out opposite the tram company, and one passenger sat in the front with me, saying, "Friend, please help me." I got out of the car, and another person came, pointing a gun at my chest, telling me to sit in the back of the car and "help." I sat in the</p>
<p>back of the car.</p>
<p>The person with the gun sat with me. I then heard them say, "The detectives are chasing us." The person in the front then drove the car to the intersection of Laoshenfu Road. They told me to get out and said the car was parked not far away, telling me to go back and drive it back. I ran to the Southern Motor Company replacement call point at the Caishi Road to call and report to the company. Later, I walked to the</p>
<p>Tianchu MSG</p>
<p>factory gate and saw the car parked there. There was no one in the car. I drove the car to the police station to report, etc. The court ordered Chen to identify whether there were any people among the defendants who had hired the car and threatened him with a gun. After reviewing the defendants, Chen replied that there were no people who had hired the car. As for the person who held the gun, he could not remember the face at the time due to fear, but he remembered that the person was very tall, wearing a coat, and had a scarf, etc. At this point, the court ordered Chen to sign a statement and adjourned the trial to 2:00 PM on February 3rd. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<h3>The Suppression of Waterfront Robbers in Nanshi Should Not Be Shirked</h3>
<p>The Harbor Management Office and the Police Station, Orders Are Not Implemented, Disturbances Continue As Before</p>
<p>Xing Zhigang, the Fifth District Chief of Shanghai County, states that robbers on the ferryboats continue to run rampant, and repeated requests for suppression have been ignored. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the Harbor Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, requesting that it work with the Municipal Police Station to strictly arrest them, stating, "It is now found that the No. 18 public ferry wharf under your management, as well as the Pinghu and Yunnan wharves of the Dali Company, are the places where ferries from various towns in Pudong, Shangfeng, and Nanchuan counties arrive and dock. The number of passengers boarding and disembarking is high. Currently, groups of robbers are lurking in the areas outside these wharves. As soon as the ferry arrives, they surround the passengers and seize their belongings. Moreover, because there are many accomplices, those who try to resist are rarely spared. The police at these wharves turn a blind eye to passengers being robbed while hiring cars on the roadside, claiming that it is not their responsibility. It is heartbreaking to see them allowing robbers to surround and rob passengers. In order to ensure the safety of fellow villagers traveling, my District Chief has repeatedly written to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordering the Dongjiadu Police Station and the 16th Precinct to send capable detectives to pay attention to strictly arresting them at all times. Unexpectedly, orders are not implemented, and disturbances continue as before. The ferryboat and the roadside both fall within the scope of municipal authority and should not be mutually shirked to avoid harming travelers. I implore your office to work with the Dongjiadu Police Station and the 16th Precinct to send capable detectives to strictly arrest and investigate them without delay in order to maintain peace and eliminate the bandit scourge. Your cooperation is greatly appreciated."</p>

The complaint states that the plaintiff Zhang Xiuying and her father have no property and came to Shanghai to work for a living. In October of the lunar calendar in the twenty-second year of the Republic (1933), the defendant learned of the plaintiff's poor family circumstances and colluded with a female worker from the same factory, Ms. Liu Sun, and others, fabricating a story that a certain factory was recruiting female workers with higher wages than in Shanghai. The plaintiff, who was only fourteen years old at the time, was young and ignorant and believed them. She left Shanghai with the defendant, Liu Zaicun, Liu Sunshi, Liu Zaibin, Yang Yumei, and others on a ship, and was taken to the Xiao family residence in Fanchuan Town, Gaoyou, Jiangbei, which is the defendant's ancestral home. Yang Yumei was forcibly taken as a wife by Liu Zaibin, and the defendant also raped the plaintiff and forced her to submit. At the time, she had no relatives and</p>

<h3>The Implementation of Hygiene Education in China (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Lin Jingcheng (Speaker) Yin Zhanwu (Recorder)</p>
<p>A lecture at the Zhenjiang Rural Nurse School Academic Conference</p>
<p>A. Introduction</p>
<p>We know that the general public in our country has always lacked basic knowledge of hygiene! This has led to the inability to practice personal hygiene, ignorance of public health, and a lack of prevention and isolation measures when infectious diseases occur, resulting in huge mortality rates! This is truly a significant loss for the people of our country! Therefore, if we want to cultivate hygienic habits in the public, enable them to obtain health security, and allow them to enjoy and utilize all the health facilities of the health authorities, we must first implement health education among the public. Implementing health education can be said to be a fundamental strategy for saving the nation and strengthening the race, in order to obtain the health of the entire nation! Therefore, it is important to know that promoting education in China does not mean simply imitating foreigners and completely transplanting foreign methods to China. The composition of Chinese society, the level of life, economic poverty, and the beliefs, religions, customs, and habits of the public are completely different from those of foreigners. Therefore, the implementation of health education in China must be tailored to local social conditions and formulate different strategies accordingly. In short, it must be able to conform to the beliefs of the public and be accepted, and even more importantly, put into practice.</p>
<p>B. Hygiene Education Should Advance Alongside General Education</p>
<p>According to the statistics of illiteracy, 80% of the people in our country do not even recognize the character "大" (big). As for the minority who can enjoy general education, they are all below the average level. Therefore, under these circumstances, we indeed feel that implementing health education is a very difficult task. This is because health education cannot be carried out independently and must advance together with general education. Health education cannot be promoted without general education, and it is also necessary to include health education as an item in general education. Otherwise, the effort will be doubled but the result will be halved, and complete effectiveness will not be achieved! Therefore, hygiene education should advance alongside general education.</p>
<p>C. The Relationship Between Hygiene Education and Production Education</p>
<p>In today's society, with the economic downturn and rural bankruptcy, it is difficult for farmers to even get a full meal. You only need to walk into the slums to see that hunger, cold, poverty, and squalor are everywhere, making you feel that the production of the Chinese people is too pitiful and there is a lack of production education! Therefore, we often see them in a state of worry when we use health services to educate them or provide them with universal benefits! The reason is that they do not reject the good intentions of health, but they have no food to eat! No clothes to wear! No house to live in! They cannot even secure food and clothing, so how can they care about hygiene? Therefore, what they hope for is that someone can help them solve the production education for filling their stomachs and keeping them warm, and the need for hygiene education is secondary. Therefore, when we implement hygiene education, we must first consider the production education of the poor.</p>
<p>Although some people say that hygiene education is part of production education. The reasons are: ㊀ Hygiene education can reduce excessive mortality; ㊁ Reduce the consumption during illness; ㊂ Increase production efficiency. Therefore, it can help the poor in production a lot, but in the minds of the public, solving the current livelihood is still a prerequisite. In short, regardless of whether it is a prerequisite or a subsequent decision, since hygiene education is a part of production education, we must not neglect production education if we want to implement hygiene education. The relationship between the two is indeed significant!</p>
<p>D. The Goal of Hygiene Education</p>
<p>The goals of implementing hygiene education are: ㊀ To cultivate the hygienic habits of the people; ㊁ To instill hygienic knowledge in the people; ㊂ To improve the unhealthy environment of the people; ㊃ To prevent the occurrence of diseases in the people. However, in my personal opinion, if we want to achieve the above goals during implementation, we must first break several unreasonable views of life that our people hold on a daily basis! ㊀ "Life and death are predestined"! ㊁ "Out of sight, out of mind"! ㊂ "Doctrine of inaction"; ㊃ "Love of the old from ancient times". Otherwise, it will still be difficult to promote at present, and in this way, if we can cultivate the moral concept of the people to maintain public health, then we will definitely be able to achieve twice the result with half the effort for the set goals!</p>
<p>E. Steps for Implementing Hygiene Education</p>
<p>The implementation of hygiene education should start from schools first. Its advantages are: ㊀ Because schools are organized groups, there is no problem of side support; ㊁ If there are difficult problems, teachers can guide them; ㊂ Elementary school students have very clear minds and their level of knowledge is relatively balanced, so what is taught is also easier to accept. Therefore, with these advantages, it is easier to promote; therefore, hygiene education must take schools as the center and starting point, and extend from schools to families, and then from families to society.</p>
<p>However, if we want to achieve results in school hygiene, we must also consider whether there is a corresponding foundation for social hygiene education, because schools and society are also related and cannot be separated from each other. Therefore, the results obtained in schools are often reduced by the friction of society and families!</p>
<h3>The Past and Present of Medical and Health in Haining County (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Xia Canglin</p>
<p>The Prevalence and Treatment of Epidemics in the Past Decade</p>
<p>Epidemics in Haining can be said to occur every year. In particular, dysentery, diphtheria, and typhoid fever are found at any time. There have been two major epidemics in the past decade. One was the epidemic of epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis in the nineteenth year, and the other was the cholera outbreak in the twenty-first year.</p>
<p>㊀ The meningitis epidemic in the nineteenth year started in Zhuqiao and spread throughout the county. As I participated in the epidemic prevention at the time, I know it in more detail. At that time, Haining set up an epidemic prevention association and established an epidemic prevention center in each of the urban areas of Zhuqiao, Fengshu Temple, Xiaoshi, and Yuanhua. Zhuqiao was the center of the epidemic area and the most severely affected, so the scale was also larger. In addition to the county government assigning me to take charge, Chen Nanping, the director of the Municipal Hospital in the provincial capital, also sent several doctors to Zhuqiao to assist. Chu Jungu, the director of the Provincial Infectious Disease Hospital, also sent personnel to Fengshu Temple to organize an isolation hospital. And Dr. Yang Zujiong of the county government had an even greater responsibility, staying up late and running around in various areas. Dr. Qian Jianchu and Yao Yongzheng of the National Health Administration, Cheng Shuzhen, the director of the Shanghai Health Testing Institute, and Luo Sai, the director of the Zhejiang Health Testing Institute, and Section Chief Xie Hanqing all came to Zhuqiao to investigate one after another. During the tense working hours, all the doctors stayed up day and night to engage in diagnosis and treatment. Each epidemic prevention center was divided into propaganda, disinfection, burial, injection, and rescue teams, which set off separately every day to carry out on-site work. As a result, in six months, about 2,000 people died (but deaths not caused by the epidemic were all included). The total number of injections was about 30,000, and the number of people who were rescued and cured was no less than 1,000. As a result of this epidemic prevention, the people of Haining gained a lot of lessons. Even the people in the countryside know more about:</p>
<p>1. Meningitis is a terrible infectious disease!</p>
<p>2. Meningitis is transmitted by contact!</p>
<p>3. To prevent meningitis, wear a mask!</p>
<p>4. To prevent meningitis, get a vaccination!</p>
<p>5. To treat meningitis, draw spinal fluid and inject serum!</p>
<p>This epidemic caused great direct and indirect losses to the countryside. The already bankrupt countryside has not been able to recover from this major epidemic.</p>
<p>㊁ The cholera outbreak in the twenty-first year. The drinking water in Haining County mostly relies on the city river. According to general customs, washing rice, drawing water, and washing clothes are mostly done in the same place. Therefore, stomach diseases have always been prevalent from time to time. Once there is cholera, a small spark will become a prairie fire. At that time, the local government thought that after the great epidemic in the nineteenth year, the years were barren, and the society was in a downturn and the countryside was bankrupt. There was no way to raise funds to handle epidemic prevention. Therefore, there was no way except to carry out preventive injections. Although hospitals in various places also provided free rescue within the possible range, there were many patients and it was difficult to accept them all. At that time, Dr. Zhang Jingyi raised funds from Shanghai gentry and established a temporary epidemic hospital in Xiaoshi. Although it only lasted for a few months, the number of people rescued was also quite a lot. However, the general public still believed in scrape-痧 practitioners, so the total number of deaths is still uncountable, but it is still considerable.</p>
<p>Opium and Flue-cured Tobacco</p>
<p>"There are no manufacturers of opium poison in Haining, and there are few traffickers. The most prevalent users are in Chang'an and Xiaoshi, because the land is located on the railway and the transportation is convenient for importing drugs. The rest, such as the Huangwan area, is where salt merchants gather, and the poison situation there is no less than in Chang'an and Xiaoshi. The drug used is purely opium, which is smuggled from the Suzhou and Shanghai areas. Most of those who are addicted are from the middle and lower classes. In recent years, due to the strict ban on opium, coupled with the failure of silkworm farming, the social economy has fallen into bankruptcy. Opium addicts have no ability to smoke again, and many have voluntarily quit. Many wealthy families have fled to Shanghai to avoid the law. Because of the strict prohibition implemented in recent years, coupled with arrest and forced abstinence, the poison situation in the territory has generally been cleared up"—This is a quote from the report submitted by Haining County to the Zhejiang Provincial Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in the 24th year (see Wu Wangji's report on the suppression of opium in eight counties)—It can be seen that those who are addicted to drugs see opium as life. As long as the ban is slightly relaxed, it is inevitable that the ashes will rekindle. Therefore, although it has been declared cleared up several times, the opium prisoners in the prison are still very crowded today.</p>
<p>Since Haining County strictly prohibited opium once in the nineteenth year and designated hospitals in various places to handle opium abstinence, in the twenty-first year, the province issued an opium prohibition plan, organized an opium prohibition committee, and established a county opium abstinence center and a drug inspection center. The poisonous gas was slightly reduced for a while. Later, the county opium abstinence center had no funds to continue running and was suspended in January of the twenty-third year. Another designated Yuqu Tang Junqing Clinic, Xiaoshi Shengsheng Hospital, Yuanhua Kangmin Hospital, Chang'an Gospel Hospital, etc. to concurrently handle opium abstinence. Afterwards, according to the order to continue the prohibition measures, funds were raised to restore the county opium abstinence center and the opium abstinence centers in the second, third and fourth districts, and reviewing physicians were hired for review. According to Wu Wangji's report, as of January of the twenty-fourth year, six hundred and eighty-three opium addicts had been detoxified. According to the investigation in August of the twenty-third year (Wu Wangji's report), the exact number of opium addicts in Haining was 1,657. Then the number of people who have not been detoxified and are still smoking is still considerable. This year, the ban was strictly enforced again, and opium abstinence centers were re-established in the urban area and Xiaoshi area. It also designated the three hospitals of Xiaoshi Shengsheng, Fuen, and Hongkang and ordered them to register and voluntarily surrender for abstinence. However, although the method was good, the county government authorities did not handle it well, and the county magistrate was found to have abused his power and fined opium addicts who voluntarily surrendered 10,450 yuan. Someone reported this to the opium prohibition supervisor, and it was published in the daily newspaper and caused a sensation far and wide. As a result, the county magistrate was released on bail, and four people including the secretary and staff were detained in the security office. The whole case has not yet been judged, but a stain has been left on the history of opium prohibition in Haining for several years. At present, hospitals in various places dare not accept opium abstinence, and opium addicts are deeply worried that they will still be imprisoned if they voluntarily surrender. Therefore, they flee far and wide, and the progress of opium prohibition has been greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Talking about Cancer (4)</h3>
<p>— Xiaozu</p>
<p>The clinical manifestation of cancerous tumors is a hard mass. When pressed, it feels like a stone. The external appearance of the anatomy is a hard knot. There is an uneven surface with protrusions, and the situation is not much different from ordinary tumors. Only this multi-peaked, uneven surface is used as an important evidence in clinical diagnosis. In the beginning, the whole body has no feeling, no pain and no itching. As it gradually grows, the body gradually becomes thin, the body weight drops layer by layer, the skin color changes to a dark color, yellowish and dull, and the local ulceration at the site of the cancer and the surrounding erosion, and even the organ function</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>failure, are of course reliable and cause suspicion. As for the definite diagnosis, the doctor cuts off a small piece from the accessible area and sends it to a pathologist for section examination, which is a definite and unchangeable method. In terms of biology, there is Klein's reaction, KlienKrebsReaKtion Klein Krebsrsktion, which can be used as a diagnostic method for the presence or absence of cancer. It is still in the trial period. The final result of cancer is Kachixee, the so-called cachexia. This is the main driver of body wasting, weight loss, and skin discoloration. As for the reason how cancer causes cachexia, physiologists have not yet given us a satisfactory answer. The reason for this, of course, must be found in metabolism.</p>
<p>The malignancy of cancer is demonstrated by its rapid growth, invasive ability, and transfer effect. Since its cause is still unclear and there is no good medicine for the symptoms, the only way for doctors to deal with it at this time is to cut it with a knife. There is no good method. Radium, X-rays, and biological methods (such as cell autolysins, etc.) are only partially certain. What makes doctors most difficult is the rapid transfer of his virus. Metastiade Before many cancer source areas reach the point of being unmanageable, the seeds of the virus have been transported to other places through the lymph or blood vessels, and quickly germinate and bear fruit. Therefore, before surgeons start, they must carefully examine the depth and breadth of the metastasis in order to determine whether the operation is suitable or not. Otherwise, if they engage in it blindly, it will only cause the patient to suffer and will not help. Just like suppressing bandits, it is necessary to make overall calculations, otherwise, it will be in vain to labor the people and waste money! What is even more troublesome than this is that cancer is prone to recurrence. Often, as soon as the initial disease is cut away, it soon regenerates in the same place, which really troubles the patient and causes the doctor to receive inexplicable blame. There is also one thing that is most annoying, that is, the places infected by the transfer of the virus have no symptoms at first, or are not very obvious. If the patient undergoes surgical treatment at this time, it seems that the chronic disease has suddenly recovered, but good times do not last long, and before long, the hidden root of the disease will sprout and grow again, one wave is flat, and another wave rises, which is really a common and unavoidable hatred for both the patient and the doctor! Here, we hope ten thousand times that there can be a reliable diagnostic method, like Klein's reaction, and has the universal and effective efficacy that can be applied in a hundred tests! To be the guide for clinicians is a very meritorious thing! Because not only doctors have many difficulties, but also patients, because this disease has very few feelings at the beginning, so they do not pay much attention. When ulcers or other symptoms become obvious, most of them have reached the point of being incurable. If there is such a method to test for the presence of cancer in the body, or get the opportunity for early diagnosis, wouldn't it be great?</p>
<h3>Eradicate Syphilis</h3>
<p>— Sun Kejin</p>
<p>Syphilis first appeared in Europe around the 15th century (when Columbus discovered the American continent) and gradually spread to our country around the 16th century (when Portuguese boats docked in Guangzhou for trade). Now it has spread to the entire earth. The reason for this is unclean sexual intercourse. If a husband transmits it to his wife, it will result in death. If a mother infects her child, it will also result in weak offspring. If it is not eradicated, it will result in infertility and even national extinction. It is truly the most dangerous disease for the nation. European countries are well aware of its harm and spare no effort to eradicate syphilis. Prussia spends no more than 8 million marks a year on preventing typhoid fever, but spends 15 million marks a year on eradicating syphilis. After the European war, one-quarter of men and one-tenth of women in Hamburg suffered from syphilis. The government took measures to reduce it, and the number of cases in the first stage of syphilis is very small. This is all thanks to the 606 agent. According to Chad and Berlin, the percentage of people suffering from venereal diseases among soldiers is 5%, students 25%, merchants 16%, and waitresses 30%. In Vienna, Austria, there were many cases of venereal disease in the past, but the government is now working to eradicate it and has achieved great results. There are no statistics in our country, but a blood test conducted in a certain school in Shanghai showed that more than 30 people had a positive reaction. It can be seen that syphilis has spread like wildfire. There are hundreds of doctors in the market, with an average of five patients per clinic. There are about several thousand people suffering from venereal diseases. If it is not prevented, it will spread from home to city, from village to village, and there is a great danger of being out of control. The government and doctors should cooperate to prevent and eliminate the disease. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Promote knowledge of venereal diseases, print pamphlets, and distribute them everywhere, so that every household knows about it.</p>
<p>(2) Set up a venereal disease exhibition, display pictures, so as to be shocking.</p>
<p>(3) Dispatch doctors to public places to give lectures on the course of venereal diseases and their dangers.</p>
<p>(4) Add a course on venereal diseases to health education in schools.</p>
<p>(5) Doctors should inform the public of methods for preventing venereal diseases.</p>
<p>(6) Patients must not arbitrarily stop treatment unless they have been completely cured by a doctor.</p>
<p>(7) Patients who violate the regulations and stop treatment may be reported to the Public Security Bureau for punishment.</p>
<p>(8) Patients who transmit venereal diseases to healthy people should be sentenced to imprisonment.</p>
<p>(9) Patients who seek medical treatment should truthfully report their address for investigation.</p>
<p>(10) Establish free venereal disease hospitals, with the goal of cure.</p>
<p>(11) Ban private prostitutes.</p>
<p>(12) Inspect public prostitutes.</p>
<p>(13) Men and women must obtain a health certificate from a doctor before marriage.</p>
<p>(14) Ban all advertisements for venereal disease drugs and require the responsibility of two or more doctors for certification. Selling drugs in newspapers is prohibited.</p>
<h3>From Winter Nourishment to Dental Protection</h3>
<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>Most Chinese people talk about nourishment in winter. They believe that in spring, the spirit is scattered, in summer the heat is scorching, and in autumn there are threats of malaria and dysentery. Only winter offers a refreshing climate, focused spirit, strong appetite, and the body is receptive to nourishment. Moreover, food is not easily spoiled. Therefore, taking nourishment at this time is easy to accomplish and its effects are easily seen. So, those who feel physically weak seize this opportunity to consult doctors and seek medicine to replenish themselves. The types of tonics are also extremely diverse. Ginseng, bird's nest, deer antler, tiger bone glue, and turtle plastron glue are favored in traditional Chinese medicine. Cod liver oil, meat extract, milk, eggs, and malt extract are recommended by Western medicine. All these involve gathering the rare and precious from mountains, rivers, forests, and fields, and extracting the essence of animals, plants, and minerals. They are specially processed, refined, and made into pills, powders, plasters, and liquids. Some tonics nourish yin, some supplement yang, some replenish essence, and some boost qi. There are also special products that nourish the brain, lungs, spleen, and kidneys, fully advertised in newspapers and filling pharmacies. Everyone follows their beliefs and chooses what suits them, hoping for miraculous effects from tonics that mend the heavens and divine pills that bring rebirth. However, although those who take them have high expectations, disappointments are common. One often sees friends and acquaintances undergoing all kinds of tonification, yet the treatments are ineffective or even weaken them further. Upon close examination, the problem is not that the body is unsuitable for nourishment, but that the nourishment is not administered correctly. To talk about nourishment, one must first know where the deficiency lies and how to replenish it. If there is no deficiency, then nourishment is unnecessary. If there is a deficiency, then nourishment should not be delayed. Is the deficiency in our bodies limited to winter? From youth to old age, the process of metabolism continues without interruption. The cells throughout the body are constantly replacing the old with the new. The old ones leave, resulting in deficiency, and the new ones come, resulting in replenishment. Throughout the day, every movement, even the slightest breath or thought, is enough to deplete physical strength and increase deficiency. Since we are constantly in this state of deficiency, there must be a natural way to replenish it. What is this way? It is natural air, inhaled through the respiratory organs, and natural food, digested and absorbed through the digestive organs, becoming nutrients that are transported throughout the body by the blood to replenish the deficiencies in cells. The more active we are, the more deficiency there is, and the greater the amount of replenishment should be. If the amount absorbed cannot replenish the cellular deficiencies in time, that is, the new cannot make up for the loss of the old, then the cells throughout the body will gradually atrophy, the functions of various parts will decline, and the body will inevitably become weak. To maintain good health and natural lifespan, one must ensure that the amount absorbed is always greater than or equal to the amount depleted. However, this increase in the amount absorbed depends on the health of the digestive function and is not solely determined by the amount of food, the quality of food, or the need for specially made tonics. A laborer who eats leftovers has the strength to subdue half, while the son of a wealthy family struggles to bind a chicken. It is often seen that the master of a wealthy household consumes delicacies and tonics every day but remains thin, while his servants eat only leftovers but are plump, with full muscles and radiant skin. Looking at animals, ruminants eat grass and become fat. Grass is mainly fiber and lacks nourishing ingredients such as protein, fat, and starch. However, when it enters the stomach and intestines of cattle and sheep, through the miraculous process of digestion, it becomes an unparalleled tonic, transforming into all the bones, flesh, fat, fur, and skin in their bodies. The fish, meat, vegetables, rice, wheat, and other foods that we eat daily are like grass for cattle and sheep. They provide everything necessary for the human body. If we can fully absorb and utilize them, they are all natural and unparalleled tonics. If the digestive function is weak and cannot absorb and utilize food, even the most precious tonics will be of no benefit to the body. The digestion and utilization of food are related to the strength of the gastrointestinal function, but they also depend on healthy teeth. The first step of digestion is not in the stomach and intestines but in the mouth. In the mouth, food is chewed by the teeth and mixed with saliva (saliva contains enzymes that can digest grains). It becomes finely crushed, soft, and moist, reaching a semi-digested state. Then, the stomach and intestines further digest this semi-digested food through the action of various secretions and absorb it into the blood, turning it into nutrients for all the cells in the body. Food that is not digested or cannot be digested is excreted as feces. People with missing or incomplete teeth cannot chew food thoroughly and cannot obtain sufficient saliva mixture. The digestion in their stomach and intestines will be slow, and the amount absorbed will be reduced. Much of the food will be excreted before being utilized, greatly diminishing its nourishing value. Moreover, if digestion in the mouth is incomplete, the stomach and intestines must work harder. Over time, this can easily lead to abnormal function and further impede digestion. Furthermore, in people with dental diseases, the bacteria in their cavities, or the pus oozing from pyorrhea or periodontitis, mixes with food and is swallowed. This not only can be absorbed into the blood and develop into various diseases, but also can directly harm the stomach and intestines, causing various gastrointestinal diseases and hindering digestion. Therefore, to ensure healthy digestive function and full utilization of food, one must first focus on protecting their teeth. We should pay attention to oral hygiene and regularly consult a dentist for examination and guidance to prevent dental diseases. If there are dental diseases, they should be treated early to stop the progression of the disease and restore chewing function. At the same time, one should quit habits that are harmful to the stomach and intestines, such as smoking, drinking alcohol, and irregular eating. If we do this, then the digestive function will become strong, and food absorption will be smooth. Every meal will be a time for nourishment, and everything will become a nourishing tonic. There is no better way to nourish the body. In this society where life is difficult and human affairs are complicated, many people feel that their spirit and physical strength are insufficient. It is certainly appropriate to seek nourishment when the body is deficient. However, the fundamental solution lies in conserving energy and reducing desires to control the flow of depletion, and especially in making every effort to maintain the health of the natural digestive organs and increasing the absorption of natural foods to increase the source of nourishment. This ensures that the body's deficiencies are fully replenished daily, and physical strength remains abundant. If one abandons the fundamentals and seeks only the winter nourishment custom, relying on medicine and tonics, even if one benefits for a season, how can this replenish the deficiencies of the other three seasons?</p>
<h3>Domestic Medicinal Plants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Folk remedy: The seed's pappus is applied to wounds to stop bleeding.</p>
<p>Crushing fresh leaves and applying the juice to swollen sores is also effective.</p>
<p>(Other uses) The white down attached to the seeds can be used as a material for inkpads.</p>
<p>Oleander family (Apocynaceae)</p>
<p>Oleander (Nerium odorum Soland)</p>
<p>(Plant) Native to India, it can be planted everywhere. It is an evergreen shrub. The leaves are arranged in whorls of three, leathery, lanceolate, with sharply pointed tips. Terminal cymes bloom in summer and autumn, bearing light red flowers. The corona has 4-7 lobes, nearly equal in length. The capsules are cylindrical and paired.</p>
<p>(Constituents) The bark and roots contain Neriolin, Neriodoin Karabin (resinous substances), phenol-like crystalline substances, and small amounts of essential oil.</p>
<p>Messrs. Sakai and Ishikawa in Japan separately isolated a non-crystalline substance from the leaves of this plant, naming it Neriocorin and Neriocorein, respectively.</p>
<p>The roots also contain palmitic acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, and the crystalline substance Kanerol C30H500.</p>
<p>(Pharmacology) ㊀Neriocorin can enhance the contraction and relaxation functions of the frog's heart and reduce the number of heartbeats. If used in large quantities, it causes the heart to stop contracting. Its effect is very similar to that of digitalis preparations. The minimum lethal dose of this substance for subcutaneous injection in mice weighing 10 grams is approximately 0.4 milligrams. Neriocorein has a similar effect to Neriocorin, but is weaker.</p>
<p>If an effective dose of Neriocorin is used continuously, it can cause fatal toxic symptoms. Repeated injections of ineffective doses over a long period can produce a suitable cardiotonic effect.</p>
<p>Of the separated Neriodorein, Neriodorin, and Karabin components, only Neriodorein is considered to have a cardiac effect.</p>
<p>(Medicinal uses) The leaves and bark are cardiotonic drugs. Because they are toxic, caution should be exercised when using them.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Hope for an Early Resolution to the Xi'an Incident</h3>
<p>— Tianyu</p>
<p>According to recent reports, although the Xi'an Incident is not hopeless, hope is very slim. It is truly a heartbreaking matter. The shocking Xi'an Incident had just concluded with the safe return of Chairman Chiang to Nanjing, but for the past half-month, a suffocating atmosphere has once again enveloped the area north and south of Tongguan. In this situation where the national crisis deepens daily and enemy conspiracies emerge endlessly, if this matter is not resolved peacefully as soon as possible, the future is cause for anxiety.</p>
<p>What is concerning is not other aspects, but that the enemy of the nation will once again take advantage of the situation. This is not without evidence. An article about the enemy's plot to incite unrest in North China after the Shaanxi Incident was published in the weekly supplement of this newspaper, Volume 2, Number 2 (titled: The Impact of the Shaanxi Incident on North China). It is a true and accurate depiction of the situation. In that article, the most important point was: If the Shaanxi Incident had been delayed a few more days, North China would be a different place today. This is a terrifying fact! Another fact is De Wang's telegram calling for a ceasefire. At the time, Soviet newspapers explicitly pointed out that it was a conspiracy to incite the rapid division of China. De Wang's ceasefire meant loosening the constraints on the Northeastern Army, implicitly directing the chaos to concentrate in the Northwest, and then launching an attack to reap the benefits once war broke out. The article in this newspaper's weekly supplement mentioned earlier is the best annotation for this observation. Therefore, Chairman Chiang's safe return to Nanjing last time was not only a cause for celebration for Chairman Chiang's personal safety, but also a cause for celebration for the nation. Who can say that if the Shaanxi Incident had not been resolved last time, North China would not have experienced a shocking change?</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the Northwest issue today, we hope even more that it can be resolved peacefully as soon as possible. The enemy's conspiracies against us take many forms. For example, they take advantage of the unrest among certain groups of us and actively, directly, and indirectly promote their disruptive actions. This is their most vicious policy. Are we going to allow this conspiring wolf to sneak into our nation's garden again? The only way to prevent this is to actively ensure that internal conflicts do not escalate. Seeking unity in peace and tightly guarding our borders is the best strategy. Regardless of one's position, today the people dare to say that everyone hopes that there will be no more internal turmoil.</p>
<p>When Chairman Chiang left Xi'an last time, his first action was to order the army to stop advancing. This was praised by the whole country. It is hoped that Chairman Chiang's spirit can be used to resolve the Xi'an issue for the second time. With the greatest sincerity, we wish that the Xi'an Incident can be resolved smoothly in peace!</p>
<h3>A Room with Sunlight</h3>
<p>— Lu Zhi</p>
<p>In Baki's spring in autumn, through the magician Badachal's mouth, it is said: "Life is only a fable: dreams are only a fable. The road of life is shrouded in dark clouds, the road of dreams shines with the smile of the blue sky: the road of life is full of weeds, the road of dreams blooms with flowers..."</p>
<p>We live, living only to dream. Our dreams unfold with sunshine, beautiful spring, but our lives are dark, filled with the evil cries of cold nights.</p>
<p>Even the sun, yes, even the sun has not entered our room for many years.</p>
<p>I made up my mind, determined to live in a house with sunlight. This determination was carried out once. The sun kissed my eyelids from morning, gently telling stories in my ear, until I was tired of leaning on the table, when the sun gently sighed, like a loving mother, leaning on the window, saying softly: Be quiet, I'm leaving. This kind of life lasted for a month, only a month, and the sun disappeared from my room forever. My windows and doors are always gray, cold, the home of the north wind.</p>
<p>This time I made up my mind again and rented a room with sunlight. Although the sun stays in this room for a very short time, I finally have a room where the sun shines. I sent this news to Ping far away, telling him that I lived in such a room, and hoped that he would come and live with me, hoping that he would accompany me, in the radiance of the sun, to find our lost, past memories. Maybe we can dream—I dream too much, afraid of dreaming, but I still want to dream, to have a happy, smiling dream.</p>
<p>I know he will be happy. The years we leaned under the north wind's windows and doors have made our enthusiasm cold. And cold, hunger, and misfortune, these frowning things, are also connected with us, unwilling to abandon us, this pair of friends, always leaning in our room.</p>
<p>I regret, regret that I have read so many stories about beautiful stories, about beautiful love lives. I read so much, and Ping also read so much, we drowsily walked into the love dream blowing with the breath of spring. However, these are just dreams for us. Although many people live truly in this dream, we can only abandon this dream, and just like we helplessly abandoned the room with sunlight, we parted.</p>
<p>But we dreamed again, like a pair of children, or like a pair of people who have lost their memories, forgetting those pains, connecting two hearts in a distant place, connecting them in a spring dream.</p>
<p>I told Ping that I had a room with sunlight. I no longer think about the fact that the room with sunlight did not bring bread, and Ping's letter only said: "A house with sunlight! Yes! The sun! We need the sun! Shouldn't the sun also have our share? I'm really happy, although I haven't seen this sunny house yet, but I'm happy! I know this house also has my share, and the sunlight also has my share! Ah, I'm really happy! Spring, sunshine, love, these are all waiting for us! Aren't they? We must live in spring, in sunshine, in love!"</p>
<p>Reading his letter, my heart trembled a little. This child always cannot remember the broken dreams, those dark, crushing dreams that are on the road where we have lived.</p>
<p>Baki teaches others to dream, talking about the paradise in dreams, but do people who live on the road shrouded in dark clouds and full of weeds dream for long?</p>
<p>Children who are picked up cannot unite, will not unite, even if they do, misfortune will also be shrouded in their bodies. Reading Ping's letter, I remembered that after living in this room, the sun has not been seen for a long time!</p>
<h3>Dragon Pavilion</h3>
<p>— You Qi</p>
<p>This ancient city, which once left a deep mark on history—Kaifeng—is now even more submerged, submerged.</p>
<p>I still remember clearly that year, sitting in a train on the Longhai Railway, when I passed through the plains of the north, what I saw was an endless expanse of withered yellow. Let the dried-up trees flee wildly, like a boat, the vast field will be a vast ocean, and the fleeing withered trees will become swaying and unstable gunwales.</p>
<p>Walking into the city gate, everything was as predicted, dilapidated roads, dilapidated city houses, and even the people living inside had dilapidated complexions. But, on the contrary, I fell in love with this ancient city, and at the same time, I fell in love with all the scenic spots in the ancient city.</p>
<p>I don't know in which book there was a record of the ancient city's "Dragon Pavilion", the deeds are no longer clearly remembered, but the name "Dragon Pavilion" is still imprinted in my mind.</p>
<p>In the weather of late winter, it was not very cold outside. Taking advantage of a fine sunny day, I groped around unfamiliar, walking on the road to the Dragon Pavilion. Passing through many crisscrossing streets, at the end of the straight street facing the South Gate Tower, there is a broken archway. Looking straight from the archway, the road is not very wide. What about the pavilion? It is not as simple as imagined. It stands majestically in the open field.</p>
<p>On both sides, there are two large ponds, generally called Erlongkeng (Two Dragon Pits). They stretch straight from the roadside to the distance, forming a large circle. The ponds are filled with stagnant water with little flow. The blue-green water is covered with thick ice. Playful children threw broken bricks and tiles onto the ice. In the center of each pond, there is a tomb revealed on the surface of the pond. Legend has it that the one on the left is "Pan Renmei" (a traitor), and the one on the right is "Yang Family Generals" (loyal patriots) of the Northern Song Dynasty. Loyalty and treachery are opposed. It is said that there are quite a few miracles. So, why did the tombs run to the center of the water? I am not very clear. The locals could not say either. However, the lonely appearance, with no tombstones or memorial services, is very likely to give people a feeling of desolation.</p>
<p>Climbing to the highest floor of the Dragon Pavilion, on the terrace of the "Great Hero Hall", looking forward, facing the door of the hall is the South Gate Tower. Outside the city gate, you can still vaguely see the "Fan Pagoda" which has lost its top. In the northeast corner, the famous "Iron Pagoda" is inserted into the clouds, a bit inclined, as if it is about to fall. Standing behind the hall and looking at the ruined "Man City" (Note), there are no houses. It is so desolate that one can hardly believe that it still exists. When the evening breeze brings the sound of bells under the eaves of the hall, this majestic building with "Dragon Steps" carved on it begins to be deeply surrounded by grayness.</p>
<p>Later, a friend told me that this Dragon Pavilion was once used by "Zhao Kuangyin" (the first emperor of the Song Dynasty). Near the South Gate, there is a river called "Rouge River", the water is always red, that is where Zhao washed his face when he fled. Later, he fled into the small alley behind the Buddha statue in the "Five Dragon Palace", lying on a small bamboo bed covered in sweat. If you ask the abbot to light a candle to explore it, there is a layer of oil on the clay statue, which is said to be sculpted based on the original expression. However, due to years of disrepair, some parts have been damaged.</p>
<p>Note: Man City, formerly the residence of the Manchus, was later destroyed due to war.</p>
<h3>Miss Mestizo</h3>
<p>— Lin Na</p>
<p>Only Zhu Shi, Da Mu and I were assigned to work in the warehouse. Our daily work was to use pliers to open entire boxes of goods shipped from San Francisco, New York, London, or Tokyo, take them out piece by piece, and distribute them in several corners. Or, according to the order list from the retail department, we would pack them into several small wooden boxes, seal them with iron strips, and write the delivery address and store number in red ink on the outside. Then, the whole batch would be pushed onto the truck by the long board hanging on the back of the truck and moved away from the warehouse.</p>
<p>When this work was done, we enjoyed complete freedom. Sometimes we would gather around a wooden board used as a bunk to play cards, taking the money we won to</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>buy wine and snacks. Sometimes the second-class clerk, Zhu Shi, would first say that he didn't want to join in, he liked to hide like a beetle in a corner with dim lights, sit on a short stool, and look down at those martial arts novels describing the lives of martial arts heroes rented from the stall, or obscene little books like sex histories.</p>
<p>"Hey! You guys?..." Da Mu turned to me angrily.</p>
<p>"I don't want to either!" I shook my head honestly. I rarely participated in playing cards. "I want to sleep!"</p>
<p>"Go to hell, all of you!" He waved his hand angrily, and walked around the room restlessly. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something, his face glowing, whistling softly in his mouth, ran out of the warehouse door, walked around in the wide patio, paying attention to a square small window on the third floor. In this window, lived an old Mestizo witch and her daughter. He started to whistle rhythmically with his lips pursed, and then the shadow of a person reflected on the window glass flashed quickly. The window opened, a dark-skinned girl's face stretched out, her eyes wide open, and a smile on the corner of her mouth.</p>
<p>Da Mu danced his hands wildly with joy. His whistling stopped, and he murmured something softly in a groaning tone. He thought she had heard it, but she could only frown, open her mouth wide, indicating that she could not understand a word. There was no way, so he made gestures. She watched quietly, laughed heartily after a while, and quickly retreated into the window. In less than three minutes, the sound of the ladder creaked, a fifteen or sixteen-year-old Mestizo girl, wearing an embroidered shirt and a printed silk long skirt, dragging cloth slippers on her bare feet, jumped lightly from the ladder like a sparrow on a threshing floor, looked back at the surroundings, and quickly flew into the warehouse. Da Mu closed the door, following behind her like a male dog.</p>
<p>Zhu Shi couldn't read the book anymore, and I had to crawl out of the bunk.</p>
<p>"Let's play cards!" Da Mu grabbed Zhu Shi, shouted triumphantly, and reached into his pocket to take out twelve cards.</p>
<p>Zhu Shi showed an helpless look, yawning lazily, sat on my bunk, and silently started playing cards. The Mestizo girl sat silently next to Da Mu. One hand was busy playing cards, and the other hand held her wasp-like thin waist. Sometimes he would pretend to be unaware and touch her precociously developed, bulging nipples with his elbow, she would gently smile and push it away.</p>
<p>Zhu Shi's face turned red. He did not concentrate well on his cards, Da Mu and the Mestizo girl's obscene actions bewitched him, igniting a passionate heat in him like the erotic books on sex histories. He often secretly thought in his heart: God knows, I don't believe that no one has come here to date her! Therefore, he played the wrong card, lost, bit his teeth angrily, squinted his eyes, and even often tore the card angrily.</p>
<p>Da Mu cunningly took out money from his pocket to count it, and said in a mocking tone: "Let's stop, it looks like you will lose your entire fortune..."</p>
<p>Zhu Shi agreed, they took out a tenth of the money in the middle, and ordered me like it was my job: "Go to the grocery store to buy wine and bread..."</p>
<p>In this way, they sat silently drinking and gnawing on sweet bread for wine. The Mestizo girl didn't drink much, but her face was red, squinting her half-drunk eyes, laughing, louder than anyone else. Sometimes she would lift up her apron, bare her feet, and dance on the cement floor, or give an order:</p>
<p>"Chinese, why don't you fight now!"</p>
<p>Half a pound of wine, plus the bewitchment of a beautiful Mestizo woman, our warriors put down their cups and cursed each other in drunken tones, and fought. She quietly stood aside, clapping her hands, while swinging her round eyes, glancing around the warehouse, looking to see if there were any parts that she could casually hide under her apron and secretly take away.</p>
<p>When the happy duel between the two warriors stopped, the Mestizo girl also slipped away at some point. When checking the opened goods, it was often found that something was missing, but no one dared to say it.</p>

<p>Yang Binkui and Yang Zhenxiong's "Jade Kui Dragon" at Yuan Chang (1120), 11:15 AM to Noon</p>
<p>Opening "Liu Yi"</p>
<p>Peach blossoms like embroidery, willows like gold. Zhang Xu invites Liu Yi to travel. Both are talented and handsome. They are classmates and from the same hometown. They go together to enjoy the scenery and seek poetic inspiration. They stroll leisurely near the seashore. They see a shepherdess with a sorrowful look. She is shy and startled when she sees people. Her attire is different from ordinary women. A kind of elegance subtly enters the spirit. He casually asks the beautiful lady about her family background. Her graceful figure doesn't resemble a shepherdess. She lowers her sleeves shyly and speaks softly. Her delicate voice is like an oriole leaving a valley. "I am here because my father is angry. Today, I earnestly request you to deliver a message. The rhinoceros hairpin on my head can serve as proof. The large tree by the river can be taken as the entrance." As she pointed and described, there was indeed a large tree by the river's edge. He lightly knocked on it a few times. Little did he know that the hairpin was made of rhinoceros horn. In an instant, it could part the sea water. In the crystal palace and glazed throne room, he sees the crowned person on the throne. The emperor was shocked and angered. "Since it is so, how can I allow this? Marriage should not be hindered by the separation of the living and the dead." The drums beat merrily with harmonious sounds. He becomes a son-in-law in the Dragon Palace, before Dongting Lake.</p>
<p>Cao Xiaoying's "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>Central and Western (1040), 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Zhao Yun"</p>
<p>Remember Zhao Zilong of Changshan from the past. He was both wise and brave, a true hero. The mediocre Yuan Shao lacked wisdom. The six mediocre grandsons' fates were sealed. The Han Dynasty declined and the world was in chaos. Rebels from all directions showed their prowess. Cao Mengde occupied Xu Du. Liu Biao was still in Xiangyang. Heroes from all over the world established their own territories. The drifting Emperor Uncle traveled east and west. The juncture of wind and cloud caused separation and reunion. Good generals and wise rulers scattered and re-encountered. Supporting the endangered lord, rescuing the dragon in distress. Who dared to fight at Dangyang? He cleverly took Guiyang and met the governor. The governor diligently held up a cup of wine with his beautiful sleeves. He righteously refused to comply. Zhou Lang also used a beauty trap. A clever plan was set in a brocade pouch. He went deep into the dragon's pool and tiger's den. The Wu ruler falsely claimed the Empress Dowager was ill. Sun Furen mistakenly believed and returned to Jiangdong. He successfully seized the lord across the Yangtze River. The Former Lord established a camp seven hundred miles long. Lu Xun used a clever strategy to burn it all. Thanks to the general, he escorted the emperor to Yong'an Palace. The emperor entrusted him with his life and held his hand. He always remembered the kindness of being recognized. The Prime Minister submitted his first memorial before going to war. He was old but still strong, acting as a vanguard. He forcefully beheaded five tiger generals of the Han family. His temples were gray but he still showed his old power and prestige. Few generals have achieved a complete body throughout history. Who can compare with his great courage? To this day, his heroic spirit penetrates the long rainbow.</p>
<p>Jiang Baochu's "Three Smiles"</p>
<p>New Sound (1380), 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Chai Jin Welcomes Guests from All Over the World"</p>
<p>Shrimps frolic in fresh water with dragons. Tigers fall on the plains and are with dogs. Lin Chong is exiled to Heng Hai. Chai Jin welcomes him with courtesy. This is called: Heroes cherish heroes everywhere. They drink heartily of fragrant wine. Suddenly, a drill instructor Hong enters. He is: He claims to have great martial arts skills. He doesn't take Lin Chong seriously. He says the exile must not have much talent. He must be mediocre. Lin Chong is: He endures his anger and lowers his head to show deference, fearing to offend the host. At that time, he was an angry whirlwind. Tell the drill instructor, a hero should cherish another hero. You must not be disrespectful. Hong Shiting was furious, wanting to suppress Lin Chong with his skills. This is precisely: A mantis trying to stop a cart harms itself.</p>

<p>㊁ Ma Nina. Cries and sounds hoarse. Summer cicadas are finally chirping on the willow tips. Water hibiscus is no longer graceful and beautiful. The ground is covered with a little bit of golden osmanthus flowers. Ma Nina. Ma Nina. Her innocence is lost. Only hating that heartless man who never returns home.</p>

<h3>The Twentieth Century Drama Society to Publicly Perform "Sai Jinhua" Soon</h3>
<p>Drama has reached the highest point in Shanghai. Advertisements for public performances occupy a large position in the newspaper almost every day. The Twentieth Century Drama Society is a brand-new organization in the Shanghai drama scene. Since the month before, it has been rehearsing Xia Yan's original seven-act fervent historical tragedy "Sai Jinhua." The play depicts the tragic state of national subjugation after the Eight-Nation Alliance occupied the capital, as well as the ugly behavior of the dim-witted and corrupt officials of the late Qing Dynasty who humiliated the country and flattered foreign powers. Especially in this time of national crisis, it evokes infinite emotion. It is said that the society has now rehearsed it to maturity and is scheduled to publicly perform it in a certain large theater starting this Friday. Those who love drama and are concerned about the modern national situation must pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>Traitors Never Have a Good Ending</h3>
<p>The waves of smuggling have not yet subsided. In fact, some heartless and insane traitors are still secretly engaging in those activities for money.</p>
<p>In Xiao Zhengzhong's "Mr. Wang's Way to Make Money," unexpectedly he is also a traitor engaged in smuggling. He relied on smuggling to earn a lot of money. He took a fancy to Li Lin, so he tried every means to coerce and lure her, and finally married Li Lin.</p>
<p>Heaven's principles are clear. Traitors cannot escape the final judgment. Just when Xiao Zhengzhong was preparing to marry Li Lin in a lively and grand manner, the police suddenly came and arrested him because his smuggling activities had been discovered. It can be seen that traitors will not have a good ending!</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Criticism on the Amateur Dramatists' Third Public Performance of "Lust Demon"</h3>
<p>The third public performance of amateur dramatists has been held at Carlton since the day before yesterday. The first play is Tolstoy's famous work "Lust Demon." This play was adapted by Ouyang Yuqian into a Chinese-style script. Hundreds of people from the writer and news community attended. The criticisms given to this play are briefly recorded below:</p>
<p>I don't understand drama, and I've only seen Chinese plays three or four times, but I was moved this time. I think this cannot only be attributed to the power of the original author. The director and actors are conscientious and can be compared with my Japanese comrades without being inferior. Speaking of makeup, daring to seriously dress up as an old woman, I heard that many actors are unwilling to do so. However, in the last scene, I heard the audience laughing, which surprised me. Doing evil things and only trying to cover them up is the Chinese way of life. Not understanding repentance seems to be expected, but the gimmick added by the director, I think, is not only unnecessary, but also a failure. I don't know if this can be used as a reference? (Hu Feng)</p>
<p>I have nothing to say about the performance of "Lust Demon" because for laymen, it has already reached the extreme of performance. What I want to say is the meaning of the script: it makes us understand the secrets of the so-called "retribution" and "divine punishment." If we put aside the so-called fog of God, we can see that it is not God who is punishing people, but the reality of society that is eating people! (Ai Siqi)</p>
<p>The emotion I received was greater than what I received from watching plays before. I feel that the success of the actors, many people have reached a higher level than before, such as Zhang Manping, Wei Heling, Ying Yin and others. (Nie Gannu)</p>
<p>The success of "Lust Demon" assures us of the new victory of drama. (Ke)</p>
<h3>Jin Shan and Shi Chao in "Midnight Song"</h3>
<p>I have nothing to say about this script and this performance. If you insist on me criticizing it, I only feel that the agriculture (the following original manuscript is difficult to identify) is not Chinese. (Xia Zhengnong) After watching "Lust Demon," it made me recognize many typical characters in the current society that I never recognized before. As for the director and acting skills, because I don't understand, I can't criticize it arbitrarily. I can only say: I seem to have watched a true story, not acting, because the characters on the stage, their actions and words, all have true feelings. (Guan Lu)</p>
<p>The most powerful way to expose reality is drama. "Lust Demon" not only exposes a kind of darkness in the old society, but also indicates its causes and consequences. (Liu Naifu)</p>
<p>Inner guilt and ethical coercion; the luck of the packaged laborers and the decline that the small landlords should have? I don't just see it as a performance of "Lust Demon." (Ni Wenzhou)</p>
<p>When I sat there watching, I felt that I was not watching a play, it seemed that what was being performed there was not actors, but myself. (Lin Na)</p>
<p>The five acts of "Lust Demon" are like five monster-revealing mirrors that completely expose a corner of the current society. (Qian Yishi)</p>
<p>Every actor in "Lust Demon" is successful. I especially like Wei Heling and Ying Yin. They make "Lust Demon" more exciting and vivid. (Qian Taisheng)</p>
<p>Touching plots, coupled with skilled performances, the audience sighed. (Jin Zeren)</p>
