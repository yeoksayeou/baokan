<h3>走私問題的嚴重性</h3>
<p>— 連士升</p>
<p>設闢征稅，是一個獨立的國家應行使的職權。古代希臘，卽實行關稅，凡輸出輸入的貨物，須賦課原價百分之二。羅馬帝國時代，關稅的稅率曾高至百分之十二點五。中古的關稅的制度，大體和羅馬相差不遠，封建諸侯在他們的領土內設立賦課的機關，對於進口的貨物，或課以貨物，或課以錢幣。然而古代和中古的關稅的目標是專為稅收，或為保護交通的報酬，並沒有其他意義。自十六十七世紀以來，重商主義和國家主義風靡全球，關稅的吢壘，好像高射砲坦克車驅逐艦一樣，已變成國防上最重要的一種工具。國內的幼稚工業靠關稅來保護，國家的大宋費用靠關稅來維持，敵人的壟斷市塲的陰謀也靠關稅來裁制。出口稅逐漸减少，進口稅不斷增加。甚至一個國家因為條約的關係，不得增加關稅的時候，政府還可以使用別種方法，很武斷地估計舶來品的價值——價值高關稅便可以多收——加拿大和澳洲的關稅制度就是使用這種方法。</p>
<p>我國的關稅制度，自道光二十二年中英締結江寗條約以來，因為受了種種束縛，利權損失不堪。到民國十七年以後，國民政府才和歐美各國，如英，美，法，德，意，比，荷，西，葡等國簽訂關稅條約。這些條約都在最惠國條欵下，承認我國關稅自主；那時只有日本不肯承勝。中間經過多次交涉，直至十九年五月六日才由中日兩國全權代表在南京正式簽字。後此，我國的關稅自主權才算完全恢復。</p>
<p>說也痛心，這兩年來我國的關稅制度又被我們開口“親善”，閉口“共存”的鄰邦破壞了。</p>
<p>自二十四年上半年起，日人便常常私運銀幣，那時海道走私還沒有擴大，大規模的走私運動還沒有成熟，所以這問題不大引起我國朝野人士的注意。到了九月，我國受日方的干涉，海關緝私艦不得在所謂塘沽協定所劃的停戰區裏行使職權，同時沿長城一帶緝私人員也被解除武裝。再後，日本海軍當局完全否認中國三英哩內的領海權，對於海關緝私艦的搜查視為海盜行為；於是浪人和漢奸彈冠相慶，走私運動越來越烈，而海關緝私的效力也消失了。</p>
<p>去年五六月問，我外交部曾一再發出抗議，日方不但置之不理，反而積極擴大走私運動：私貨由秦皇島，北載河，南大寺，留守營等地源源運至天津東車站，然後一面由大批載重汽車運到熱河，內蒙，庫倫，平地泉等地，一面由津浦鐵路運到濟南以下各站，而平津冀晉豫的街市，更是無處不是私貨。讀者試到北寗路的幾個大車站去看一看，便知道這兒有一大堆布疋和人造絲，那兒有大批煤油汽油，前邊有堆積如山的白糖，後邊有橫七豎八的紙料；而食品，化妝品，電料，玩具，自行車零件等雜貨還不算在內。</p>
<p>日本是工業先進國之一，在正常的貿易下，她的產品本可以亳不費力地和各國競爭。尤其是在工業落後的中國，資本微小，技術笨劣，稅率低微，不易和她抵抗，何况這兩年來她再加上走私——以武力做後盾的大規模的走私？長此以往，中國的工商業前途何堪設想！</p>
<p>統計我國因走私所受的損失，顯而易見的是華北廈門等地的海關稅收的銳减。據財政部公佈，秦皇島關，津海關，烟台關，膠海關等四關，二十五年稅收總數合計國幣六千一百四十萬元（萬以下的數字從略），較二十四年共减八百六十萬元。江海關二十五年稅收總數計一百四十九萬元，較二十四年减二十六萬元。廈門關二十五年稅收為五百四十六萬元，較二十四年减五十五萬元。我們把這些數字合計起來，差不多快到一千萬元。然而這只是兩年收入的比較，實際上，我們關稅的損失實什倍於這數目。因為自去年四月起，私貨進口更突飛猛進；據專家的佔計，這些源源而來的私貨假如都要納稅，至少我們每月可以多收八百萬元，一年便可以多收一萬萬元。這是多麽驚人的數字。</p>
<p>這兩年來，中國的工業受走私的影響很大，尤其是津滬的紗業，因走私的關係而倒閉清理者不下十餘家。日本趁這機會，以天津為中心，實行收買接辦華商紗廠，並以最大的决心增加錠數到三十三萬，企圖剝奪全中國的棉紗業。處心積慮，無非不許我國的工業抬頭，使中國的原料和市塲完全受日本的支配。在商業的方面，新創的商店雖多，但倒閉的數目實加倍。據去年十月六日申報的記載，天津有五家銀號因為市面蕭條，銀根奇緊，五日同時倒閉，其餘受時局不安和週轉不靈的商號，在一星期內將有數十家歇業。這種情形是直接間接地受走私的影響。</p>
<p>此外，我們還遭着一個最大的損失，就是我國海關的尊嚴全完被日人傷害了。緝私人員不時被浪人痛歐，塘沽海關辦事處曾被浪人擊毀。近來更變本加厲，住在天津的日浪人自上月十二日一度强佔小西門分卡後，便於每夜十二時至次晨一時間，以載重汽車八九輛滿載私貨，押往約定地點。如遇緝私人員來搜查，浪人便以武力對付，痛打的痛打，架走的架走，這種蠻不講理的行為，不但有害於海關的尊嚴，而且是蔑視我國的主權的表現。</p>
<p>從另一方面着想，走私封於日本的精神上信義上也是一個很大的損失。日本雖然有一批浪人專幹走私的勾當，但日本國內眞正想維持正義的明達君子一定不在少數。他們自然懂得什麽呌做國際公法，什麽呌做正義公道，同時他們還想在國際舞台上說幾句漂亮話。不過走私一天沒有停止，這班維持公理的人的言論也會失掉精彩，因為這很容易使人疑惑浪人的行動多少是得了他們的默認。我現在除想中國厲行禁止私運的辦法外，很誠懇地希望日本的朝野人士以全力禁止走私，一來可以維持他們的“共存共榮”的誠意，二來可以消除東亞兩大民族間的仇恨。“解鈴仍須繫鈴人”，禁止走私，實有賴於日本的特別努力。</p>

<h3>日本之寃獄賠償制度</h3>
<p>— 張秉鋆</p>
<p>日本之有寃獄賠償制度，始於一九三一年卽昭和六年四月二日公佈之刑事補償法，該法於同年七月一日施行，共有條文廿條，較諸德•奧•法•意•諸國，可謂規模粗具，雖其內容卑不足稱，然資以借鏡，而為研究之一助者，正多，爰節述其要義，以實特刋補白。</p>
<p>㊀寃獄賠償之節圍日本乏刑事補償法，其適用不僅限於司法上之寃獄，舉凡軍法會議宣告無罪者，亦有準用之規定，關於賠償範圍，一為巳受刑之執行，或拘押所受之損失，一為依照刑事訴訟法之通常手續，再審或非常上訴而經宣告無罪，或不予起訴者，在裁判確定前羈押所受之損失。</p>
<p>㊁賠償之請求及其手續賠償之請求，應向宣告無罪之法院，及予以不起訴處分之預審推事所隸屬之法院為之。</p>
<p>前項之請求，應以書面，並須附具戶籍之謄本</p>
<p>㊂賠償之方法賠償之方法，（一）因羈押所為之賠償，按照實際羈押之日數，予以每日五元以內之賠償金，其因懲役禁錮等之執行，所為之賠償亦同，（二）對於已受死刑執行之遺族，除因拘押所為之賠償金外，再由法院酌定相當之金額，予以賠償，（三）因執行罰金所為之賠價，返還其已繳付之罰金，（四）因沒收犯罪物所為之賠償，在沒收物尚未損壞或廢棄時，返還其已沒收之物，如沒收物已竟處分不能返還時，則應賠償其處分沒收物所得之金額。</p>
<p>㊃賠償請求權之繼承（一）應受賠償人已死亡者，其賠償，對於本人之遺族為之，又死亡者因再審或非常上訴而宣告無罪時亦同，（二）應受賠償人於請求後死亡者，其生前請求，視為遺族順位人所為之請求，（三）應受賠償之遺族死亡時，按照遺族之順位次序，予以賠償，（遺族之順位，本人之配偶•子•孫•父•母•祖父及祖母。）</p>
<p>㊄賠償之除外規定受無罪或免訴之裁判而有左列各欵情形之一者法院不予賠償，（一）未滿十四歲之犯罪，或有心神喪失，耗弱，瘖啞，等情形之一者，（二）因本人之故意，或重大過失，以致被訴，羈押，或為請求再審之原因者，（三）被起訴之行為顯然違反公共秩序及善良風俗者，</p>
<p>又併台罪之裁判，其一部雖因無罪或免訴而其他部分，受有罪之宣告者，法院得不為賠償。</p>
<p>㊅賠償請求之消滅時效寃獄求償權，須在無罪或免訴裁判確定後，六十日內為之。</p>
<p>上述六端，為日本刑事補償法所規定之重要內容，足可窺其制度之一斑，惟近世先推各國，莫不重視人民生存之權利，國家對於人民，有無刑罰之權，胥視人民之行為，是否違法論斷，際此國家政策，漸趨法治之階段，國家與人民之行為，同受法律之限制，故寃獄之賠償，不僅屬於法律責任上之問題，亦可認為法律政策上之問題，法文內容之制定，與國家政策，不無連繫之關係，吾國尚在草創對於寃獄賠償的立法，當以適合國策及社會現狀為準則，將來之採廣義主義，抑採狹義主義，與賠償之方法，是否僅限於金錢上之補償，就金錢以外之捐失，有無適富之補救方法無有詳細討論之必要，至於㊀賠償金額是否應視被寃人之地位，經濟，而有區別，或為槪括之規定，由法院自由裁員，㊁求償權行使之消滅時效，㊂應否另設寃獄法院，實有賴立法諸公之深思遠慮，吾人不禁馨香祝壽者也。</p>
<h3>寃獄賠償運動之回顧與前瞻</h3>
<p>— 俞承修</p>
<p>我國之寃獄賠償運動，發軔於民國二十年，當時全國律師協會，舉行第三屆代表大會於杭州，曾建講政府對於過誤之裁判，負賠償之責任，二十二年六月，舉行第五屆代表大會於靑島，又請求政府頌布寃獄賠償法案，翌年九月，舉行第六屆代表大會於廣州，遂决議組織寃獄賠償運動委員會，專司其事，以迄於今，為時蓋已六年矣。</p>
<p>在此六年之中，律師界人士，受協會之策動，殫精竭慮，奔走呼號，以謀寃獄賠償制度之確立，賴輿論界人士之同情的贊助，而司法當局亦嘗表示不因司法經費之困難而漢視，是以二十五年五月五日宣布之憲法草案，有國家賠償制度之專條，全國司法會議，並先經决議由司法院送立法院，今年舉行此種運動，更得初步草案脫稿之訊，凡此數端，一方仰見中央之重視法治，關懷民瘼，一方亦未始非六年來努力所得僅有之結果。</p>
<p>寃獄賠償制度之理論，讀者當已耳熟能詳，母待吾人之斤斤辭費，惟世人對於此種制度之確立與實施，不免尚有若干之非難，敢掬至誠，以申鄙見：</p>
<p>今之非難寃獄賠償制度者，槪括以言，約有三點：或以寃獄賠償制度實施之後，足以印證寃獄之多，旣有損法治之威嚴，復有妨法權之收回。或以寃獄賠價需定額之經費，現在司法事業，亟待建設者，不止一端，實不能兼籌並顧。或以寃獄賠償制度實行之後，因避免賠價之責任，勢將平反無從，得不償失。凡此三者，在表回上視之，固未嘗無片面之理由，然究其實際，實乏立論之根據。</p>
<p>夫寃獄賠價制度，固為事後亡羊補牢之計，然此種制度確立之後，司直之士，凜於責任之重大，鞠獄斷訟，必將更臻詳愼，而上級長官，銓選監督，亦必益臻嚴密，間接未始不足收預防之效，行見罰必有罪，有何寃獄煩多之可言？寃獄之須賠償初不自我始，彼法治先進國家，若英美則數見於判例，若法日則明定於法典，若外，果以此為口實者，我人正不妨請其反躬自省，固不容鰓鰓過慮者也。</p>
<p>其次：以言經贊，我賢明之司法當局，早已有所表示，本不能據為非難，就我國司法現狀而論，普設法院，改建監所，雖在在需費，然事有輕重，勢不得不權其緩急，普設法院，所以便民也，然在未經晉設法院以前，究當有審判之機關：改建監獄，所以惠囚也。然在未經改建以前，究尚有感化之處所，獨寃獄賠償制度，一日不見諸實施，無辜蒙寃之良民，卽一日不能得所慰藉，實足减低法治之信仰，其重要實較普設法院，改建監所為其。且法院普設與監獄改建，非一朝一夕之功，江西之改建一新監也，需欵二十八萬餘元，福建之改建一新監也，需欵亦達二十五萬元，以此為例，恐更非短期內所得完成，然則寃獄賠價運動之實施，將渺渺無期，何以慰國人喁喁之望耶？</p>
<p>况寃獄賠償制度，國家對人民負其責任，而法官又對國家負其責任，茍無辜蒙寃，不僅國家對人民應盡其賠償之義務，而法官亦須對於國家負其賠償義務，是以上級審决無避免賠償責任而迴護上級審之理：且辦案考成，國有常規，法官訓練有素，亦决不致捨法徇情，自貽失責之愆也。</p>
<p>準斯以論，寃獄賠償制度，實非前述之理由所得非難，揆諸近日事勢，亦非論述之非難所得阻礙。要知寃獄構成之後，無辜良民，身體自由，橫受羈束，原非金錢所得補償，而以金錢補償，實係最低之要求，不可不力促其成！</p>
<p>現在初步法案，雖已脫稿，而公布實施，尚屬有待，我人更當本旣往之精神，悉力以赴，薪求按步邁進，卽見實施，願與全國人士共勉之！</p>
<h3>從寃獄賠償說到法權統一</h3>
<p>— 酈鰲奎</p>
<p>全國律帥界倡導的寃獄賠償運動，自從民國二十年律師協會第三屆代表大會通過以後，便立刻引起了廣大羣衆的注意，因為寃獄賠償制度的確立，不但曾遭沉寃而獲得平反的人，在精神上和物質上，得着無限的慰藉，使他心頭上被刺的創傷平復過來，從積極方面說，對於職掌刑罰權的官吏，在審理案件的時候，能夠平心靜氣地探求事實的眞相，不致曲解法條，敷衍程序，甚至煆煉周納，造成莫須有的寃獄。所以寃獄賠償制度的眞正精神，絕對不是希望被寃人能夠得到賠償，而是希望寃獄的减免，古書上說：“刑期無刑”，牠的解釋，就是國家制定刑罰，並不是要使人犯罪，其最大的目的，乃是要使人不犯罪。寃獄賠償法如果能夠製定實施，則職掌刑罰權的官吏，便覺到自己的責任重人，而為公正確當的裁判。因此，這個制度的成立，在人民應享的自由，旣然更多一重保障，同時，中國司法的前途，也能夠越加顯露光明，這是决然無疑的。</p>
<p>現在祇就事實而論：人民不幸而身罹法網，其犯罪事實是確實證據的，當然應該判以刑罪，反之，其人本來沒有罪證，而職掌刑罰權的官吏因故意或疏忽置之囹圄，剝奪了他的自由，則人民在精神上和物質上所受的損失，便無從估計，並且寃獄的結果，往往會釀成其他的慘劇。所以寃獄賠償的目的，直接方面固然是使寃獄絕對不會發生，而間接方面就是提高法治的精神，這種制度在歐美各國，都已經實施，就是日本，也早就規定了。</p>
<p>中國的司法制度，在近年不可以說沒有相當進步，但寃獄賠償法，經全國律師界幾年來不斷的努力要求，司法院在民國二十四年召集全國司法會議，雖然通過了寃獄賠償制度，出事隔兩年，還沒有經立法院製定法律，在撤廢各國在華領事裁判權呼聲最高的今日，我們認為寃獄賠償法的製定，實在是刻不容緩，何以呢？領事裁判的存在，各國者藉口中國的司法制度未曾改善，如果寃獄賠償法頌布了，職掌刑罰權的官吏？對於斷獄决訟，一定更加謹嚴，更加愼重，那麽，中國的法治精神，便充分地表現出來，各國也就無從再事推諉。</p>
<p>根據上面兩點，寃獄賠償制度的實行，無論對內或對外，都有明顯的意義，尤其是在法權統一運動急劇進展的現在，越加應該促其實現！</p>

<h3>華德路監獄參觀記（上）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>舊金山的阿爾加特拉士監獄，報紙常常說起那是堅固像鐵桶一般，從來沒有發生越獄情事，上海的華德路新監獄，甚至有更可羨慕的成績。不但其中的囚徒沒有越獄的，並且從來不懷嘗試恢復自由的心念。這個監獄能容六千餘名囚徒，可算得世界上最大的一個。我們久聞這個監獄的名聲，當然很願意參觀一番。到了那裏，隨隨便便地經過第一第二道大門，不過到了第二道大門之前，有一個守衛在鐵欄裏面張望了一下，然後才開門放我們進去。於是那守衛帶我們到一間小小的辦公室，停留了數分鐘，由一個俄國守衛把我們的名片送給獄長華赫爾大尉。一會兒他回到辦公室，便呌我們跟着他走，於是又經過一道門，進到監獄的天井裏，那門內有十餘個中印巡捕把守。</p>
<p>華赫爾大尉在他的辦公室裏接見我們，我們問了許多話，他很有耐性地一一回答了。後來便說最好到監獄各部游覽一番，便能知道獄裏的一切組織。於是便由副獄長格蘭特做我們的領導，他是監獄中服務最久的職員。他說我們可順着罪犯從下囚車起，入獄的經過次序參觀。所以我們首先來到鑰匙室，監獄中一切鑰匙，都由一個西捕頭掌管，凡職員要領取任何鑰匙，都得先在簿子上簽名，守衛用鑰匙開了門，進到第一盤問室，罪犯到了那裏，原有的姓名，都得取銷，按着號簿上的次序給他一個號數。他從入獄那天起，至出獄那天止，不再稱張三李四，只稱某某號犯人。罪犯在這室中，經過搜查，跟騐明他的卡片後，便給他一個有號數的小圓銅牌。於是進到第二室，在裹土席面把身上所穿的衣服剝去，以便燻蒸消毒，那衣服在獄不再穿着，須等他離獄恢復自由的時候才取出發還。在洗浴剃光頭髮鬍子之後，便由獄醫檢騐身體，如有疾病，須先送獄中的醫院醫治，醫愈之後，便到衣服室領取一套兩色布製成的囚徒的服裝。那衣服是按監禁期的長短分別顏色，黑白二色，左胸有黃色標記的，那是監禁十年到十五年的囚徒，藍黑二色的，是終身監禁的囚徒。諸如此類，不能盡舉。所以管獄的人，一望便知那囚徒犯的是輕罪，或是重菲。那囚徒穿上新服裝後，便被帶到一間訓導室，由主管員對他高讀訓條，並告說他如欲免受懲罰，當事事遵守規條。囚徒受訓之後，便入囚室。全獄共有屋八所，每所有四百六十間囚室，未成年的囚徒，另行收禁在幼年部。</p>
<p>入獄最初幾個月，除去每天領到室外體操練兩次外，每天須長閉在一個很小的囚室裏。經過幾個月，倘若行為良好，便有機會進獄中的工塲工作。有那裏他可得到同伴，並且可賺些錢，但每人有監禁期內，無論如何久長，所賺的錢數，至多以一十元為限。因為獄中囚徒的人數很多，所以另設一屋，專供煮飯之用。每天須備飯二萬餘客，飯菜都放在大鍋，用蒸汽煮熟，再用洋鐵罐分盛，送鉛各囚徒，為免染疫起見，每個洋鐵罐都在餐前用沸水煮過。每天吃的是米飯與鹽水豆，並且摻和未襲過的米幾成，以防發生脚氣病。一月之中，有幾天吃葷，如牛肉豬肉或鹹魚之類。大廚房共有廚子跟帮忙的雜工數十人，都由囚徒充當。同時分散飯食給幾千個囚徒，却不是一件易事，因此便在獄中造了狹軌的鐵道，飯菜煮好了，卽由鐵道上運到獄中各部分，那自然比用人提送，靈捷許多，這個麻煩問題，就此解了。當我們經過印刷部的時候，朝裏一望，看見一個囚徒的肩膀，他很忙碌地在那裏繕寫工部局刑事科的報告單，他因為能寫字，所以派他担任這個役務。據領導人告訴我們，工部局用的許多文件，都在這兒印刷，馬路上所貼的彩印布告，勸人種牛痘，走路要謹愼，夏天要衛生等類，都是出於囚徒之手。囚徒中甚至有美術家，担任繪圖製樣等工作。印刷部設備完全，可跟外面的印刷所並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>還有一個皮鞋部，那俄國聯隊與中印巡捕穿的皮鞋，都是在其中製成的，每年還替他們修理。囚徒穿的拖鞋，也是自己製的，都用舊車胎做鞋底，穿了拖鞋，自然不易奔逃。囚徒穿的號衣，在成衣部製成，巡捕的號衣，由成衣匠裁好之後，也送到獄中的成衣部縫紉。獄中的其他製品，有網球網，蓆子，毛刷鉛皮用具，木器，籐器，一共有好幾十種。彫花的木器，都是有好手藝的工匠所製，廣銷世界各處，那買主斷想不到是囚徒的製品。工部局各部與獄中所用的物品，大半由囚徒製清，但是囚徒所做的物品，多數是外面定製的，每年所得的餘利，很為可觀。</p>
<h3>師資</h3>
<p>— 周戈</p>
<p>現在這個世界，我們可以呌牠做“資格的世界。”為什麽呢？因為你如果沒有“資格，”那你休想“吃飯。”你要投考公司機關，必先自己問問“有沒有資格呢？”就是說，你有一張中學畢業的文憑麽？（當然，有大學畢業的文憑是更好了。）沒有的話，那你還是識相一點，不要浪費照相費，車費等，安安心心挨餓吧。</p>
<p>然而社會旣要人人的資格，那末社會給人人以資格就得啦！可是不！沒得錢的窮小子，還是進不得中學，大學是更不要去妄想了！不過，卽使你中學畢業，大學畢業，有了一張吃飯的證書”、卽文憑，然而，在現在這個“畢業卽失業”的時代，你還是沒有辦法的這社會是有資格的大家在掙飯吃，那末沒資格的怎未樣呢？這說來不是夠悲慘麽？</p>
<p>早些時候，（就是現在還這樣，不過問題却嚴重得多了，）失業者只要有個“高小”的資格，你沒辦法的時候，你就可以往“弄堂小學”要一溜，暫時可以避避風雨，塡飽一下肚子。這條路有人戲為“英雄末路，”當然，等到時勢變得好一點，可以跳出龍門東山再起的！然而小學敎育的危機隱伏在此，是也可想而可見的了。</p>
<p>現在有人提倡“良師興國”的運動，這當然是個很好的運動，因為目下的中國如果不“興”是會“亡”的。興國之道，當然很多，然而良師興國，”似乎是尤為要著。因為良師非但對我們國家未來的主人翁有着很大的影響，卽是社會，也有着的很重要的意義的。因此跟着這就來了“師資”的問題，所謂“師資，”就是當敎師的“資格。”師要良，國才可興</p>
<p>以下接第三版</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>，這樣說來，良師當然得要個資格的。我在前面說過：“這是現在還這樣，不過問題却嚴重得多了。”就是指這個當敎師的也得要有個資格了。</p>
<p>“天下興亡，匹夫有責，”這是家常便飯的一句話。良師興國，在這句話的意義下，當然會是不成問題的，會成問題的，是那位敎帥是不是站在“興國”的立塲上來敎育兒童，影響社會。而敎育當局，也不必一定苛求他的“資格”是否是帥範舉業，因為這樣一來，會平空又增添大批的“失業軍”的，所以捕救的辦法，是給與敎師們一種必要“進修”的科目。陳鶴琴先生在六六敎師節特刋上有“怎樣實踐我們的信條，”第二十四條至第二十六絛中有云：“參加有研究性質的敎育學會：每日閱讀書報至少一小時；實騐研究各科敎學，”如果眞的這樣辦起來，我相信，一方面把小學校當作“避難所”的敎師們的那種荒謬觀念會改正過來，而同時，非但不會平空增添一大批的“失業軍，”而良師在實踐的意義上，顯然是會有着成効的。我希望這是“師資”的實質意義。</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Guan Jiyu, Special Commissioner of Sichuan Finance, visited Zhang Qun, Zou Lin, and Lu Peizhang on the morning of the 12th for further instructions. In the afternoon, he took a fast train to Shanghai to meet with Xu Kan to determine the date of the 14th for returning to Sichuan with a personal letter from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report back to Liu Xiang. According to Guan, the issue of reorganizing the Sichuan army, negotiated by Liu Hangchen, representing Liu Xiang, with Minister He in Nanjing, has been largely resolved. It only awaits the central government to send senior officials to Sichuan to preside over the matter. The purpose of my trip to Lushan to meet with Chiang Kai-shek was to report Chairman Liu's compliance with the central government's proposed plan. Chiang eagerly hopes for its early implementation and has a personal letter to convey to Chairman Liu. I am going to Shanghai today and will return to Sichuan on the 14th with Liu on a CNAC plane. As for the candidates for the central government's delegation to Sichuan, whether it will be He Yingqin or Zhang Qun has not yet been fully decided.

<h3>Opinions of Sichuan-Kang Generals on Military Reorganization Plan</h3>
<p>Obey Government Orders and Conscientiously Comply; Deeply Hope the Central Government Will Issue Implementation Measures Soon</p>
<p>[Chengdu] Regarding the issue of the Sichuan-Kang military reorganization, after Liu Xiang sent Liu Hangchen to Guling to consult with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and fully expressed Liu's support for the reorganization plan, the central government decided to send He Yingqin to Sichuan to guide the reorganization. In the future, all Sichuan-Kang armies, except for Yang Sen's 20th Army stationed in Guizhou, will be reorganized according to the principle of nationalizing the armed forces. It is also reported that senior Sichuan-Kang military generals will soon visit the central authorities to discuss everything. After this reorganization, the Sichuan-Kang armies will certainly strive harder and become a strong force for the nation. In order to understand the opinions of senior Sichuan-Kang military generals on the reorganization plan, the Central News Agency reporter interviewed Deng Xihou, commander of the 45th Army, Li Jiayu, commander of the 47th Army, and Liu Wenhui, chairman of the Xikang Provincial Establishment Committee and commander of the 24th Army, for details. All agreed to be interviewed and expressed enthusiastic support, believing that the Sichuan-Kang armies must be nationalized and that they must be under the leadership of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to complete the great task of reviving the Chinese nation. The statements made by the Sichuan-Kang military generals to the reporter are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>Deng Xihou's Statement</p>
<p>Briefly stated that since the Third Plenary Session of the current Central Executive Committee made the resolution on thoroughly reorganizing the national army, the entire nation has wholeheartedly supported it. If we have a clear understanding of the current national situation, then supporting the central government and the leader, and accepting the resolution of the Third Plenary Session should not be delayed. The heads of various armies have always held a sincere heart of support for the central government. They will surely be happy to comply with the central government's proposed plan for reorganizing the Sichuan-Kang armies, without a doubt. It is hoped that the central government will determine and issue the military reorganization implementation measures as soon as possible so that the reorganization can begin as soon as possible. As for all units of the 45th Army, which originally had 53 regiments, it has already undergone an automatic reduction in force and now has 42 regiments. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek came to Sichuan, it has been ordered to reduce the force by another one-third, so it now has a total of 24 regiments. Now, we are waiting for the central government's military reorganization implementation measures to be finalized and promulgated. How should it be reorganized in the future? We will surely obey the order and start complying as soon as possible, always striving to become nationalized and under the leadership of the Chairman to do our best to save the country from its perilous state. If the central government needs me to go to Chongqing or Nanjing, whenever and wherever, once summoned, I will depart immediately, etc.</p>
<p>Li Jiayu's Statement</p>
<p>Briefly stated that regarding the central government's military reorganization plan, I vow to support it with the utmost sincerity. I eagerly hope that the central government will issue an order as soon as possible to thoroughly reorganize it. The problem with the Sichuan army is that it is "large but not精锐 [精锐 = well trained/elite]." To talk about reorganization, we must follow the central government's intentions and conscientiously comply. As a soldier, I only know the two words "obedience." If it benefits the nation and the region, even if it is ordered to disband all the units under my command, I will not have any reluctance. After all, the Sichuan-Kang army is the nation's armed force and cannot be acted upon arbitrarily by one or two people. I have met with Army Commanders Deng Xihou and Liu Wenhui in recent days to exchange views on the Sichuan-Kang military reorganization issue, and we have all reached a unanimous conclusion, namely, to support the plan set by the central government and implement it to the end.</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui's Statement</p>
<p>When the reporter visited Mr. Liu, he was suffering from a toothache and had recently had a tooth extracted, so he was unable to give a long interview. He only briefly expressed his opinion, stating that the Sichuan-Kang armies have long needed reorganization. This time, the central government is determined to reorganize, and I am very happy to comply. I will now take the central government's order as the basis to ensure that the military reorganization plan can be completed quickly. If I need to go to Nanjing, I can leave immediately. Liu said at the end that he originally planned to return to Kang province in May, but because the military reorganization plan has not been fully negotiated, he is still staying in Chengdu. Once the central government makes a detailed decision, he will return to Kang province and comply. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

<h3>Chaotic Situation in Chabei Commercial Center and Other Places</h3>
<p>Insurgent Army Spreading Wider; Bandits and Puppets on Alert Day and Night; A Certain Party's Poisoning Policy</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Jining News, Chongli, Huade, Shangdu, Xinghe, and other places in Chabei have recently entered a state of turmoil. The insurgent army led by Zhang Chengde is spreading wider, and the four puppet armies are panicked and on alert day and night. The troops at Duolun are also increasing one after another. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] On the 12th, according to people from Guyuan County, all villages and towns south of the county were occupied by the Yi people led by Li Ying on the 10th, and they once fiercely attacked the county seat but failed. They are still in the hands of the bandits and puppets. Li's troops are said to number 4,000, divided into five divisions. Li and his troops are mostly green forest heroes from the Rehe West and Chahar East areas with strong combat power. The local authorities, seeing their growing power, decided to immediately mobilize a large army to force them out of the territory. Also, the Chabei bandits and puppet troops are now collectively called the Mongolian Army, with Prince De as the commander-in-chief, Li Shouxin as the deputy, and chief of staff, and Wu Heling as the speaker.

In addition to manufacturing highly toxic substances locally, it will also transport them to other places, and the profits will be used to fund Wang's bandit army. Wang's troops have now dispersed. There are currently 16 opium dens, 18 heroin houses, and more than 20 morphine dens in Zhangbei city. (Special dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Judicial Yuan Instructs Subordinates to Fulfill Responsibilities and Rectify Election Administration</h3>
<p>Do Not Be Involved in Delay or Partiality, So as Not to Hinder the Progress of Election Administration</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Judicial Yuan believes that this national election is an important ceremony for the nation and is of great importance to the future of constitutional government. On the 12th, it specifically instructed the Ministry of Justice and the Supreme Court to transfer the instructions to their subordinate judicial personnel, to cultivate the spirit of fairness and justice, fulfill their duties faithfully, so as to achieve the effect of rectifying the election. The original order is as follows: To order compliance, Article 55 of the Amended National Assembly Representative Election Law stipulates that election lawsuits shall be under the jurisdiction of the competent high court and shall be tried before other lawsuits to conclude in one instance. Article 56 stipulates that crimes related to elections shall be punished in accordance with the Criminal Law. Furthermore, Articles 142 to 148 of the Criminal Law provide very detailed regulations for crimes of obstructing voting. Currently, the election affairs of the National Assembly representatives are in active progress. Prosecutors at all levels have the authority to impeach criminals and bear heavy responsibilities. Although election crimes sometimes harm individuals, they are often unable to file private prosecutions due to circumstances. Only by prosecutors automatically exposing and prosecuting can those who obstruct voting be unable to escape the sanctions of the law. As for the trial, whether it is an election lawsuit or an election crime case, both must be impartial and promptly tried to obtain a final fair verdict. Do not be involved in delay or partiality, so as not to hinder the progress of election administration. It must be known that this election is an important ceremony for the nation and is of great importance to the future of constitutional government. Judicial personnel should cultivate the spirit of fairness and justice, fulfill their duties faithfully, so as to achieve the effect of rectifying the election. The Judicial Yuan has high hopes for this. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Shen's Case Not Debated in Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>Defendants File Statement Claiming Disqualification; Believe the Presiding Judge is Biased; Suspension of Litigation Proceedings Awaiting Ruling</p>
<p>The case of Shen Junru and others accused of endangering the Republic of China was originally scheduled to be debated in court yesterday. However, because Shen and the other seven people believed that the presiding judge was biased, they requested disqualification. Therefore, after the court opened, only four of Shen and the others read the records of the court hearing the previous day before announcing the suspension of litigation proceedings to await a ruling. The various circumstances are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Request for Disqualification</p>
<p>When the court opened on the previous day, the defense lawyers of the defendants presented many witnesses and material evidence that were favorable to the defendants. The judge rejected the requests of the defense lawyers to investigate the witnesses in court. The defendants Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, and Shi Liang all believed that the presiding judge was biased. Therefore, they filed a statement on the morning of yesterday requesting disqualification.</p>
<p>Suspension of Trial</p>
<p>The Jiangsu High Court originally scheduled the debate in the case for 1 p.m. yesterday. Shen, Zhang, Wang, Li, Zou, Sha, and the other six were still escorted by the patrol team of the police station and taken in three cars from the detention center to the court at 11:30 a.m. to rest in the criminal waiting room. Soon, Shi Liang and Luo Qing were signed to issue one after another. Wu Songgao and Gu Liuxin also arrived at the court on time to surrender themselves. It was not until 2 p.m. that the presiding judge Fang Wen began to open the court in the first courtroom with the two judges Wang Jue and Zheng Chuanying and the secretary. The defense lawyers of Shen and the other seven people, except for Qin Liankui and Jiang Yiping, who did not know about the request for disqualification beforehand and had come to the court, all the others did not come to the court. Only Zhuang Rang, Li Wenjie, and Jing Shucheng, the defense lawyers of Luo Qing, Wu Songgao, and Gu Liuxin, arrived at the court on time, but did not appear in court. After the court opened, the secretary first read the records of the statements made by Wu Songgao and Gu Liuxin during the court hearing the previous day. Both had no objections. When it came to reading Luo Qing's record, Luo Qing presented a paper of testimony written in advance to the court for verification. At this time, the secretary handed Shen Junru's record to himself for reading. Shen read for about 50 minutes and requested several corrections. After Shen Junru finished reading, the presiding judge announced the suspension of trial proceedings and adjourned at 3:20 p.m. Except for Wu Songgao and Gu Liuxin, who were still released on bail, all the other defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<p>Director Zhu's Statement</p>
<p>According to Zhu Shusheng, Director of the Jiangsu High Court, the case of Shen Junru and others accused of endangering the Republic of China has been suspended due to the request of the seven defendants Shen, Zhang, Wang, Li, Zou, Sha, and Shi for the presiding judge to be disqualified, and is awaiting a ruling. Regarding the request for disqualification, it is necessary to wait for the original trial judge to deliberate and rule. If the deliberation results in the conclusion that the reasons stated by the defendants are indeed appropriate, then another judge will be selected to open the trial. If the deliberation results in the conclusion that the defendants' request is unfounded, then it will be handed over to another judge for deliberation to make a final ruling. As for the three defendants Luo Qing, Wu Songgao, and Gu Liuxin, although they did not request disqualification, the litigation proceedings were also suspended because they were in the same case as Shen and the others. This matter can be ruled in about three to five days, and then a date will be set for the next trial. A special development occurred yesterday (12th) in the trial of the case of Shen Junru and others endangering the Republic of China in the Jiangsu High Court. The case was originally scheduled to continue in court yesterday afternoon. However, because the seven defendants Shen Junru and others, as well as another defendant Luo Qing, believed that the court's judges refused to investigate the evidence in the case on the previous day (11th) and believed that they had prejudices, they separately submitted requests for disqualification to the Jiangsu High Court (see below). The court accepted it. At the opening of the court at 2 p.m., Presiding Judge Fang announced that the litigation proceedings were temporarily suspended due to the request for disqualification by Shen Junru and others. Ren Chonggao and Gu Liuxin read and signed the records in court. Presiding Judge Fang instructed them to go home and await trial. Then Shen Junru's record of the 11th was handed over to Shen for reading. After Shen carefully read and corrected many places, two places were marked with parentheses in the record by the secretary to indicate "error" because the meaning of the records was unclear. Finally, Shen Junru signed. The records of the other people could only be made in future days because the secretary had not had time to sort them out. Finally, Shen Junru and others adjourned at 3:30 p.m. and were still sent to the detention branch for detention at 4:30 p.m. Because the request for disqualification had been made on that day, all the defendants' lawyers did not attend. It is now necessary to await a ruling from the High Court. Although Presiding Judge Fang had been notified of the request for disqualification, his attitude was peaceful. When Shen Junru was reading the record, Presiding Judge Fang instructed the other defendants to sit and wait. After the adjournment, reporters from various newspapers in Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu asked Shen and others to write and sign their names to keep as souvenirs.</p>
<h3>Statement of Request for Disqualification by Shen and the Other Seven People</h3>
<p>Stating that we, Shen Junru, Zhang Naiqi, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Zou Taofen, Sha Qianli, and Shi Liang, are the defendants in the case of being accused of endangering the Republic of China. Because the judges of the collegiate panel have all executed their duties, there is an obvious risk of prejudice. We hereby jointly request a recusal. This case was summoned for trial on the 11th of this month. Before the trial, the court's restrictions on those who requested to attend the hearing were extremely strict. Inspections, registrations, and issuance of permits were sufficient to maintain a cautious order. However, suddenly, the hearing was prohibited on a temporary basis. After the court opened, although the presiding judge claimed that the reason for the prohibition was to prevent harm to public order, he did not specify any concrete facts that could be feared after the permits were issued. It is doubtful that the trial of this case may have a situation that cannot be made public. When the trial began, after the presiding judge questioned each defendant about the facts of the case, each defendant and defense lawyer successively presented evidence methods favorable to the defendant with respect to the facts listed in the indictment and requested the court to investigate. There were more than 20 points in total. Presiding Judge Fang did not hesitate to look back at the two judges Wang and Zheng sitting next to him and signaled in silence, and immediately informed of the ruling to reject the request. Even if he only signaled by shaking his hand, he did not answer. The defense lawyers all requested to reconsider, but they were stopped from speaking with the excuse of time constraints, making it impossible to fathom. This kind of trial attitude and method cannot be said to be in line with the provisions of Article 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law in any criminal case. Moreover, in this case, it is related to endangering the Republic of China, and the statutory jurisdiction belongs to the High Court. The defendant's exercise of the right to defend himself on the facts is only this one trial. However, before the public prosecution was filed, the prosecutor's investigation lasted for four months, and the evidence of guilt listed was as many as ten clauses. However, any important evidence favorable to the defense proposed by the defendant for any clause was discarded and ignored. The judges of the collegiate panel have all had preconceived notions, cannot listen to the lawsuit with an open mind, and will only use the arguments in the indictment that are unfavorable to the defendant as litigation materials, making it difficult to obtain a legal and fair trial. It is obvious that it has the reason shown in Article 18, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. We hereby request that the presiding judge Fang, who is presiding over this case, and the two judges Wang and Zheng, who are sitting as assessors, all recuse themselves in accordance with the preceding section of Article 20, Paragraph 1 of the same law, and specify, according to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of the same article, that the record of the trial on the 11th of this month, which uniformly rejects the request to investigate evidence, shall be used as the method of explanation. We beg that you make a ruling in accordance with the law and suspend the litigation proceedings in accordance with the provisions of Article 22 of the same law, so that it may be convenient. We hereby submit this to the Jiangsu High Court for your review.</p>
<h3>Luo Qing's Statement of Request for Disqualification</h3>
<p>I, Luo Qing, am the defendant in the case of endangering the Republic of China. The judges hearing the case have executed their duties and have a risk of prejudice. I hereby request a recusal. I have secretly consulted the record and the presiding judge should thoroughly investigate the evidence after questioning the defendant. Article 267 of the Criminal Procedure Law clearly stipulates this. However, in this case, when the defendant and defense lawyer were summoned for the first time on the afternoon of the 11th of this month, more than 20 types of evidence were requested to be investigated in court, but none were rejected. Moreover, it was notified in court that the trial would continue on the afternoon of the next day, which has a tendency to hastily conclude the case. In such a large event, there are more than ten reasons listed in the indictment. If the evidence is not investigated and it is hastily concluded, who can believe that there is no preconceived notion? For this reason, in accordance with the provisions of Article 18, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law, I hereby request that all the judges of the collegiate panel recuse themselves. Respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu High Court.</p>

<p>Assault on Our Fishermen's Representatives - Resolved After Police Intervention</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Recently, a Japanese fishing boat was discovered fishing with nets in the waters off Zhupeng Estuary outside of Lianyungang. Fishermen from Dongxi Liandao believed it was infringing on their fishing rights and sent representatives to dissuade them. Unexpectedly, the Japanese were extremely arrogant and assaulted the fishermen's representatives, causing outrage among the fishermen of the two islands. Many gathered, intending to resist, and the situation was quite serious. Shi Yunzhang, the third squad leader of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team, learned of the matter and rushed to quell the situation, strongly advising the fishermen not to act rashly to avoid accidents. Shi personally went to the Japanese boat to negotiate, explaining that Lianyungang was China's exclusive navigation right, and foreigners should not encroach on coastal fisheries. Unable to justify their actions, the Japanese boat left yesterday. Captain Shi has reported the incident to the Jiangsu Provincial Government. (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>

The Ministry of Finance allocated 150,000 yuan from the 25th-year flood prevention funds to the Whole Economic Committee for collection, transfer, and application, as the committee's 25th-year dike prevention expenses were fully allocated.

<h3>The Seriousness of the Smuggling Problem</h3>
<p>— Lian Shisheng</p>
<p>Establishing taxation is a power that an independent nation should exercise. Ancient Greece implemented customs duties, requiring a tax of two percent of the original price on all exported and imported goods. During the Roman Empire, customs duties were as high as 12.5 percent. The customs system of the Middle Ages was generally not much different from that of Rome. Feudal lords set up taxation agencies within their territories, levying taxes on imported goods, either in goods or in currency. However, the goal of customs duties in ancient and medieval times was solely for revenue or as a reward for protecting transportation, without other significance. Since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, mercantilism and nationalism have swept the globe, and customs barriers, like anti-aircraft guns, tanks, and destroyers, have become one of the most important tools in national defense. Domestic infant industries rely on tariffs for protection, national expenses rely on tariffs for maintenance, and enemy conspiracies to monopolize markets are also restrained by tariffs. Export taxes are gradually reduced, and import taxes are constantly increased. Even when a country is unable to increase tariffs due to treaty relations, the government can still use other methods to arbitrarily estimate the value of imported goods—higher values allow for more tariffs to be collected—the customs systems of Canada and Australia use this method.</p>
<p>Since the Treaty of Nanjing concluded between China and Britain in the twenty-second year of Daoguang, China's customs system has suffered immeasurable losses of rights and interests due to various restrictions. It was not until after 1928 that the National Government signed customs treaties with European and American countries such as Britain, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain, and Portugal. These treaties recognized China's customs autonomy under the most-favored-nation clause; at that time, only Japan refused to acknowledge it. After many negotiations, it was not until May 6, 1930, that the plenipotentiary representatives of China and Japan formally signed the treaty in Nanjing. After this, China's customs autonomy was completely restored.</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking to say that in the past two years, China's customs system has been destroyed again by our neighbor who constantly proclaims "friendship" and "coexistence."</p>
<p>Since the first half of 1935, the Japanese have often smuggled silver coins. At that time, maritime smuggling had not yet expanded, and large-scale smuggling movements had not yet matured, so this issue did not attract much attention from Chinese officials and the public. In September, China was interfered with by the Japanese, and customs anti-smuggling vessels were not allowed to exercise their duties in the demilitarized zone delineated by the so-called Tanggu Truce Agreement. At the same time, anti-smuggling personnel along the Great Wall were also disarmed. Later, the Japanese naval authorities completely denied China's three-mile territorial waters rights and regarded the search by customs anti-smuggling vessels as piracy. As a result, rogues and traitors celebrated, the smuggling movement became increasingly intense, and the effectiveness of customs anti-smuggling disappeared.</p>
<p>Last May and June, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs repeatedly issued protests. The Japanese not only ignored them but also actively expanded the smuggling movement: smuggled goods were continuously transported from Qinhuangdao, Beizaihe, Nandasi, Liushouying, and other places to Tianjin East Station. Then, on one hand, large numbers of heavy-duty trucks transported them to Rehe, Inner Mongolia, Kulun, Pingdiquan, and other places. On the other hand, they were transported by the Jinpu Railway to stations below Jinan. The streets of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, and Henan were filled with smuggled goods. If readers visit the major stations along the Beining Railway, they will know that there is a large pile of fabrics and rayon, a large amount of kerosene and gasoline, a mountain of white sugar in front, and a chaotic pile of paper behind; and that does not include groceries such as food, cosmetics, electrical materials, toys, and bicycle parts.</p>
<p>Japan is one of the advanced industrial countries. Under normal trade, its products can easily compete with those of other countries. Especially in industrially backward China, with its small capital, clumsy technology, and low tax rates, it is not easy to resist her. What's more, in the past two years, she has added smuggling - large-scale smuggling backed by force? If this continues, what will be the future of Chinese industry and commerce?</p>
<p>The reduction in customs revenue in North China, Xiamen, and other places due to smuggling is obvious. According to the Ministry of Finance, the total tax revenue of the four customs offices of Qinhuangdao, Tianjin, Yantai, and Jiaohe in the 25th year was 61.4 million yuan (omitting figures below ten thousand), a decrease of 8.6 million yuan compared to the 24th year. The total tax revenue of the Jianghai Customs in the 25th year was 1.49 million yuan, a decrease of 260,000 yuan compared to the 24th year. The tax revenue of the Xiamen Customs in the 25th year was 5.46 million yuan, a decrease of 550,000 yuan compared to the 24th year. When we add these figures together, it is almost 10 million yuan. However, this is just a comparison of two years' income. In reality, our customs losses are ten times greater than this number. Because since April of last year, the import of smuggled goods has increased dramatically. According to experts' estimates, if all these incoming smuggled goods were taxed, we could collect at least 8 million yuan more each month, and 100 million yuan more per year. This is a shocking figure.</p>
<p>In the past two years, Chinese industry has been greatly affected by smuggling, especially the yarn industry in Tianjin and Shanghai, where no fewer than ten companies have closed down and been liquidated due to smuggling. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Japan, with Tianjin as its center, is implementing the purchase and takeover of Chinese yarn factories, and with the greatest determination, is increasing the number of spindles to 330,000, attempting to deprive the entire Chinese cotton yarn industry. These meticulous plans are nothing more than preventing Chinese industry from rising, so that China's raw materials and markets are completely controlled by Japan. In terms of commerce, although there are many newly established stores, the number of bankruptcies has doubled. According to the Shen Bao on October 6 of last year, five silver shops in Tianjin closed down simultaneously on the 5th due to the sluggish market and tight money supply. Dozens of other shops affected by the unstable situation and poor turnover will close down within a week. This situation is directly or indirectly affected by smuggling.</p>
<p>In addition, we have suffered one of the greatest losses, which is that the dignity of our customs has been completely damaged by the Japanese. Anti-smuggling personnel are often beaten by rogues, and the Tanggu Customs Office has been destroyed by rogues. Recently, they have intensified their efforts. Since the 12th of last month, Japanese rogues living in Tianjin have forcibly occupied the Xiaoximen sub-card once. Every night from 12:00 AM to 1:00 AM the next morning, they use eight or nine heavy-duty trucks fully loaded with smuggled goods and escort them to the agreed location. If anti-smuggling personnel come to search, the rogues use force to deal with them, beating them and taking them away. This unreasonable behavior is not only harmful to the dignity of the customs but also a manifestation of contempt for China's sovereignty.</p>
<p>From another perspective, smuggling is also a great loss to Japan's spirit and credibility. Although there is a group of Japanese rogues who specialize in smuggling, there must be a considerable number of enlightened gentlemen in Japan who truly want to maintain justice. They naturally understand what international law is, what justice and fairness are, and at the same time, they want to say a few nice words on the international stage. However, as long as smuggling does not stop, the words of these people who uphold justice will lose their brilliance, because it is easy to make people suspect that the actions of the rogues are somewhat tacitly approved by them. In addition to wanting China to strictly prohibit smuggling, I sincerely hope that Japanese officials and the public will do their best to prohibit smuggling. First, they can maintain their sincerity in "coexistence and co-prosperity," and second, they can eliminate the hatred between the two major ethnic groups in East Asia. "The one who tied the bell must untie it." The prohibition of smuggling really depends on Japan's special efforts.</p>

<p>[Berlin] The German Society for Sinology, the Far Eastern Association, and the Hamburg East Asia Research Society jointly hosted a banquet for Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, at the Kroll Opera House this afternoon. In addition to the special envoy's delegation and key members of the Chinese Embassy, ​​representatives from various German ministries, finance, economy, culture, industry, and leaders of organizations promoting Sino-German relations, as well as journalists, were invited to participate, creating a grand occasion. First, Admiral Raeder, President of the Society for Sinology, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the three organizations dedicated to promoting Sino-German relations, announcing that he had recently learned that a prominent German businessman had generously donated 100,000 marks to help Chinese youth studying German technology and industry. He then stated that seven years ago, he served as the head of the German industrial delegation to China. He was amazed at the grand plans for reforming China's economy and culture explained to him by Chinese government officials, especially General Chiang Kai-shek. Over the past seven years, the reforms and developments in China's economy, industry, and culture have been so rapid that not only Germany but also all countries in the world have expressed excitement and admiration. Raeder continued to point out that Kong's visit would further enhance the long-standing Sino-German friendship and expressed the hope that the efforts of the two countries would achieve coordinated cooperation, so that the close Sino-German friendship would be built on a solid and natural foundation. Then, Dr. Kong Xiangxi delivered a reply in an unusually cordial tone, mentioning that he had visited Berlin once in 1930 during his tenure as Minister of Industry, and he will never forget the pleasure of that trip, and he will especially remember the sincere hospitality he has received on this trip. Kong continued to say that since 1930, the economic, cultural, and social relations between China and Germany have become extraordinarily close, and he deeply hopes that this kind of mutual assistance and mutual reliance will be further developed and improved day by day. Kong reiterated his previous statement, saying that China has a vast territory and rich resources. He hopes to cooperate with Germany in exploring raw materials and developing industries. Finally, Kong raised his glass and said, "I sincerely wish my German friends good health." Kong's speech was interrupted by enthusiastic applause several times.

<p>[Berlin] Chinese Ambassador to Germany Cheng Tianfang recently held a reception at a villa near the "Green Forest" lake to welcome Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, and Chen Shaokuan, Minister of the Navy, and their entourage. The "Green Forest" lake area is one of the most luxurious areas in Berlin, and the villa is magnificent in architecture, richly furnished, and boasts beautiful gardens and lake views. Cheng Tianfang and his wife treated the guests with great enthusiasm, and Tan Boyu, Counselor of the Embassy, ​​and Tan Baoduan, First Secretary, assisted in the reception. The leader of the diplomatic corps, Archbishop Orsenigo, the Papal Nuncio, and other envoys from various countries all attended. Japanese Ambassador Count Mushanokoji and Counselor Yauchi spoke Chinese and exchanged greetings with members of the Chinese delegation. Several members of the Chinese side also spoke Japanese and conversed with them, creating a very pleasant atmosphere. When Vice President Kong arrived at the meeting, everyone present warmly welcomed him. Among them, Prince Bird Shann, the Iraqi Minister to Germany, had a long conversation with Vice President Kong. Kong then gave an interview to a Havas reporter, saying, "I have been very welcomed in Berlin, and I am very satisfied with the results of this trip. I am also very fortunate to be going to Berchtesgaden to visit Leader Hitler." Chinese Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan also told a Havas reporter that Ambassador Cheng Tianfang's reception was very grand and he enjoyed it very much. A Havas reporter then spoke with Chiang Wei-kuo, son of Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Chinese Executive Yuan. He said, "I will be entering a German military academy on October 1st of this year. When I am required to serve in the German army, I will naturally wear a German uniform. A few days ago, my father sent a telegram saying that he was in good health, which I was very pleased to hear. When the Xi'an Incident occurred last year, I initially did not believe it was true, but later I became extremely anxious." Vice President Kong and his entourage later accepted an invitation from Deputy Minister of Aviation General Milch to attend a performance at the National Opera House in the evening. (Central News Agency, 11th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German newspapers are paying close attention to Kong Xiangxi's visit and pointing out the importance and closeness of Sino-German relations. The Frankfurter Zeitung today published a front-page news item on Chinese Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi's talks in Berlin for the benefit of mutual benefit between the two countries. The newspaper emphasized that although a clear Sino-German commercial agreement has not been discussed, the importance of this discussion is not diminished. Sino-German relations have not had any special diplomatic or commercial form for decades, and their prosperity and closeness have never changed. This is due to the foundation of mutual friendship between the two countries, without the need for artificial clauses. Dr. Speicher, Vice President of the Society for Sinology, also published a long article in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, pointing out that further development of Chinese relations is not only possible but also beneficial, because each country can export what the other country needs. German industry can help China develop industries and implement major transportation construction plans, while China can supply Germany with large quantities of raw materials, especially as Germany's agricultural plan is completed and large-scale development of resources is beginning, its needs are particularly urgent. Therefore, people from all walks of life in German politics and economics are very pleased and optimistic about the progress of China today under the leadership of capable leaders in all aspects of politics and economics.

<h3>Russian Supreme Court Sentences Eight Traitor Generals to Death</h3>
<p>Stripped of Military Ranks and Executed by Firing Squad; One of Five Soviet Marshals Removed</p>
<p>[Moscow] Eight senior generals of the Soviet Red Army were sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal of the Supreme Court today for treason and betrayal of the country. The trial was conducted in strict secrecy. However, it was heard that before the death sentences were handed down, the defendants were stripped of their military ranks by the court. According to the new law, none of the defendants were allowed to appeal or request leniency. The executions by firing squad were carried out before dusk today. (Twelfth, National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The eight people arrested in Soviet Russia, including Deputy Commissar of Defense General Tukachevsky, Commander of the Leningrad Military District Yakir, Commander of the Byelorussian Military District Uborevich, President of the Chemical Aviation Association Eideman, Military Attaché to the British Embassy Putna, Commander of the Moscow Military District Kork, and other generals Feldmann and Primakov, were tried by the Supreme Court yesterday and sentenced to be deprived of their military ranks and sentenced to death. The crowd listening to the trial demanded that the so-called "Kirov" law be applied and that the defendants be executed immediately without appeal. (Twelfth, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Ulrich, Chief Judge of the Special Tribunal of the Soviet Supreme Court, Chairman of the Military Tribunal of the Soviet Supreme Court, and Army Judge, along with Assessors Yakhnis, Deputy Commissar of Defense of the Soviet Union and Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Second-Rank Commander; Budyonny, Marshal of the Soviet Union; Blücher, Marshal of the Soviet Union; Shaposhnikov, Chief of the General Staff of the Red Army, First-Rank Commander; Belov, Commander of the Byelorussian Military District, First-Rank Commander; Dybenko, Commander of the Leningrad Military District, Second-Rank Commander; Kashirin, Commander of the North Caucasus Military District, Second-Rank Commander; and Kotyachev, Commander of the 6th Cossack Cavalry Corps of the Stalingrad Cossacks, held a secret trial on the 10th in accordance with the legal procedures of December 1, 1934, to try the cases of Tukachevsky, Yakir, Uborevich, Kork, Eideman, Feldmann, Primakov, and Putna. The defendants were accused of violating Article 58, Sections 1, 8, and 11 of the Soviet Russian Criminal Code. After the indictment was read, Presiding Judge Ulrich asked the defendants whether they admitted to the charges against them. The defendants all pleaded guilty. The trial confirmed that the aforementioned defendants were hired by the military intelligence agencies of a certain country with unfriendly relations with the Soviet Union to systematically provide secret information to the military circles of that country, implement destructive measures to weaken the power of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, prepare for the defeat of the Red Army when the Soviet Union was attacked, and deliberately assist in the division of the Soviet Union and the restoration of the power of landlords and capitalists in the Soviet Union. The Special Tribunal of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union determined that the aforementioned defendants had jointly committed violations of military duty (breach of oath), betrayal of the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, and treason, and should be deprived of their military ranks, and Defendant Tukachevsky should also be deprived of the title of Marshal of the Soviet Union, and all should be sentenced to death and executed by firing squad. (Twelfth, TASS)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After the news of the Soviet authorities sentencing eight Red Army leaders to death was reported, a Japanese army officer familiar with the situation in the Soviet Union said that General Tukachevsky was a first-class tactician in the Red Army and was also proficient in English and French. Both he and his wife were well-known socialites in Moscow society. Generals Putna and Primakov had served as military attachés in Japan. Putna was proficient in the situation in the Far East, and Primakov, although young, was a great figure and excelled in tactics. Others such as Yakir, Kork, and Uborevich were also important figures in the Red Army. The Soviet Union's loss of these eight people may strengthen Stalin's dictatorship, but from the Red Army's point of view, it is a great loss. (Twelfth, Allied Telegraph)</p>

In addition to including the qualitative restrictions contained in the London Treaty of the UK, France, and the United States, it also contains an annex that slightly modifies the naval agreement established between the two parties in June 1935, which stipulates that the total tonnage of the German navy should account for 35% of the total tonnage of the British navy, so as to adapt to the new agreement between the UK and Germany, and it specifies that Germany may increase the tonnage of certain types of warships to more than 35% of the total tonnage of British warships of the same type, provided that it reduces the tonnage of other types of warships so as not to exceed the 35% ratio. As for the construction of 10,000-ton cruisers, Germany originally requested to build five ships, while the Soviet Union believed that if Germany could reduce two ships, the Soviet Union could accept building only seven 8,000-ton cruisers. However, this was rejected by Germany, so negotiations were difficult. The United Kingdom recently explained to Germany that the 1936 London Naval Treaty prohibits the construction of 10,000-ton cruisers, and this type of warship will eventually be eliminated sooner or later, so there is no need to repeatedly argue. Therefore, the new draft agreement does not involve the number of 10,000-ton cruisers.</p>
<p>㊁ The draft agreement between the UK and Russia has not been finally accepted by the Soviet Union. In addition to including the qualitative restrictions contained in the 1936 London Naval Treaty, it also takes into account the special position of the Soviet Union in the Pacific.

<h3>Number of German Kindergartens Increases Dramatically</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The National Socialist People's Welfare Association of Germany, the largest organization in Germany for seeking public welfare, is engaged in various public welfare issues, especially focusing on women and children. Among them, the dramatic increase in the number of kindergartens is the most significant. On May 1, 1935, the organization had 57 kindergartens. By the end of 1936, it had increased to 1,915, with a total of 86,000 children. In addition, it has widely established so-called "Autumn Harvest Kindergartens," which take care of children in the fields during the farmers' harvest season. There were 1,400 of these kindergartens in the fall of 1936, more than double the previous year. (Eleventh, National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Famous Italian Professor and Brother Assassinated in France</h3>
<p>Formerly Detained for Anti-Fascism, Also Wounded While Aiding in the Spanish War</p>
<p>[Paris] Two important Italian figures, the famous economist Professor Rosselli and his brother, the historian Sabatini, were suddenly assassinated today in the Coudray villa in Normandy. According to the French police authorities, this action has a political background. Because there was still 250 pounds of money beside the deceased, it can be determined that it was not robbery. Professor Rosselli was imprisoned on the island of Lipari for opposing Italian fascist politics, and later escaped and engaged in anti-fascist activities in France, and organized the Italian Anti-Fascist Volunteer Army to assist the Spanish government forces in combat. Rosselli himself participated in the battle and only returned to France for treatment after being injured. (Central News Agency, Twelfth, Reuters)</p>
<p>⊙ Bagnoles-de-l'Orne, France. Two Italian expatriate journalists were suddenly assassinated in the forest today. There was an abandoned car near the corpses, with bloodstains all over the car body. The corpses were later identified as Rosselli, a reporter for an anti-fascist newspaper. The newspaper is published in the Latin Quarter of Paris, and most of its readers are Italian political exiles. The other corpse was his brother, also a reporter for the newspaper. (Twelfth, National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙ Bagnoles-de-l'Orne, France. Regarding the case of the two Italian anti-fascist journalists being murdered, it has been determined that the deceased were the Rosselli brothers. The elder, Carlo, was 38 years old and was shot in the leg on the Aragon front in Spain. He came here for treatment. The younger, Nello, was 37 years old and a well-known university professor. He recently arrived here from Florence, Italy. The police have launched an investigation into the case and learned that the two deceased lived with several others in a certain hotel. However, except for the deceased, all have now gone to Paris. There was also an empty car near where the corpses were found, with an empty pistol box and a box full of gunpowder on the car seat. Near the corpses, there was a dagger. Giuseppe Nitti, son of former Italian Socialist leader Nitti, is now in Paris and told a Havas reporter that Carlo Rosselli was a friend of his who had joined an anti-fascist group and was also associated with a certain secret group with many branches in Italy.

<h3>Western European Pact</h3>
<p>France Sends Note to Britain, Explaining Accommodating Attitude</p>
<p>[London] According to authorities, regarding the signing of the new Locarno Pact, the French government submitted a new note to the British government yesterday, stating its position, which is divided into three main points. First, regarding the exception clause of the new Locarno Pact, the old Locarno Pact stipulates that when one of the signatory countries must fulfill the obligations of the League of Nations Covenant, it should be treated as an exception and not apply to the organization of the Pact clause. Later, France and Russia concluded a mutual assistance pact within the scope of the League of Nations Covenant, so when signing the new Locarno Pact in the future, the mutual assistance pact between France and Russia and the League of Nations Covenant should be treated equally and regarded as exceptions. However, Germany and Italy opposed treating the mutual assistance pact between France and Russia as an exception, so the French note will respond to this, believing that the old Locarno Pact originally complemented the League of Nations Covenant, and Germany's accession to the Locarno Pact was conditional on Germany's accession to the League of Nations, so this exception has in fact been recognized by Germany, and the purpose of the exception clause is not to make one particular country benefit exclusively, but to enable each signatory country to fulfill the obligations stipulated by the clauses of the League of Nations Covenant. Even if the direct purpose of the Western European Pact is to guarantee the security of Western European countries, it must not completely cut off the relationship between the signatory countries of the Pact and the outside world, and it must not completely ignore various international principles, such as the obligation to respect the territorial integrity of other countries, etc. This principle was recognized by Germany in its note to Britain in April of this year. As for the mutual assistance pact between France and Russia, Italy has recognized that this mutual assistance pact complements the broader security system contained in the League of Nations Covenant, so it can be regarded as an exception to the Locarno Pact organization. Although France is still opening the door to coordination on this issue, if the principles on which the various exception clauses in the old Locarno Pact are based can be respected, the French government is prepared to make this exception organization more flexible. Second, the issue of guaranteeing the new security system. The Italian government suggested that if one of the two guarantor countries believes that the guarantee measures should not be implemented, the other country should also not implement the guarantee. The French note criticized this claim, believing that it was inappropriate, and argued that the guarantee should be reciprocal, which is in line with Germany's long-standing ideal of equality. Third, the issue of determining the international organization of the implementation mechanism of the new Locarno Pact. In order for the Pact mechanism to be implemented and to decide whether the events that occur should be treated as exceptions in the new Locarno Pact, it should be determined by an international organization. However, Italy and Germany both opposed using the Council of the League of Nations as this international judgment body. France, on the other hand, argues that in the event of an emergency, in other words, when a clear act of aggression occurs, the clauses contained in the new Locarno Pact can be implemented automatically, but in the event of a non-emergency event, the Council of the League of Nations can decide whether to implement the Pact mechanism. However, France does not insist on this level and expresses its willingness to take a compromise approach, that is, if other international organizations that respect the principles of the League of Nations can be established, France is also prepared to consider this solution in order to reach a compromise with Italy and Germany. In short, regarding the above three main points, France has expressed its efforts to accommodate both the exception clause and the international organization involved. Therefore, the British government believes that this new French note should facilitate the negotiations on the new Locarno Pact. (Central News Agency, Eleventh, Havas)</p>

<h3>US Steel Industry Strike Worsens, 150,000 Workers Strike</h3>
<p>Workers Open Fire on Airplane, Governor Refuses to Declare Martial Law</p>

The Republic Steel factory in Warren is still surrounded by striking workers. When an airplane delivering food to the workers inside the factory flew near the factory yesterday, it was shot at by striking workers, with about 40 shots fired. The plane was immediately forced to land. After the striking workers at the Newton Steel factory in Monroe clashed with the police yesterday, automobile workers in Pontiac, Michigan, have decided to hold a demonstration in Monroe on the 13th to protest.

After six hours of meetings, the Governor issued six proposed solutions, hoping that both parties would accept them, advocating that the factory should only sign work contracts with members of the Steel Workers Organizing Committee, but the union must also guarantee that it will no longer demand the right to represent all workers.

<h3>International Labor Conference</h3>
<p>Japan Opposes the Forty-Hour Week System</p>
<p>[Geneva] At the International Labor Conference today, 26 representatives from various countries spoke, each displaying their eloquence, and expressing their opinions as much as possible on the report of the Governing Body of the Labor Bureau and the social issues involved in the report.

<h3>Japanese Authorities in North China Crack Down on Japanese and Korean Vagrants</h3>
<p>Attempt to Change International Opinion, Japanese Merchants in Tianjin Propose Suggestions</p>
<p>[Tianjin] There are more than 50,000 Japanese and Korean vagrants scattered throughout North China, of which 65% are unemployed and lead a vagrant life. Recently, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in order to clean up the drug trafficking organizations in North China and change international opinion, has ordered the Tianjin and other consulates to be responsible for handling unemployed vagrants. Takahashi Takeo, a Japanese merchant in Tianjin, wrote an article commenting on this matter, believing that vagrants colluding with unscrupulous Chinese people to engage in illegal businesses hinder the friendship between China and Japan and cause Chinese people to have negative feelings towards legitimate Japanese residents. The vagrants residing in the Northeast are especially despicable. If North China implements a crackdown, it should prohibit those who have declared their vagrancy from entering the country.

<p>Washington Correspondence The newly appointed Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wang Zhengting, recently set off to the United States to take office and was warmly welcomed along the way. The grand scale of the ceremony can be said to be unparalleled among the overseas Chinese communities here.

The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Welcomes from All Sectors</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese here believe that the key to maintaining world peace is to strengthen the friendly relations between China and the United States. This time, Ambassador Wang is holding a mission to the United States, which is of great significance. Therefore, it is planned to express a warm welcome when Ambassador Wang arrives to celebrate the progress of Sino-US relations and to show the patriotic spirit of the overseas Chinese. Since receiving the news that Ambassador Wang would arrive in Beijing on the 26th of this month, preparations were made for a car parade, and the US Police Department assisted the welcoming committee in maintaining traffic order, sending motorcycle escorts and setting up a large parking lot at the station. On that day, Chinese overseas Chinese in our country hung flags to celebrate, and Chinatown on H Street was very lively. At 3:00 pm, vehicles from all walks of life gathered in Chinatown, with flags numbered and lined up, and then returned to the union to welcome him one after another. At 4:45 pm, the car entered the station. Ambassador Wang, along with his two daughters, Anqing and Anfu, Second Secretary Liu Yunfang, Attendant Jiang Yanrong, and Trainee Li Gongyuan, got out of the car, dressed neatly with smiles on their faces. The welcoming staff shook hands with each other. Ms. Li Xingchun and Chen Zhouli, on behalf of the welcoming committee, presented flowers to the ten daughters. For a time, news reporters flocked to take photos, and flashes of electricity shot out. Ambassador Wang went to the east gate of the station in the crowd of welcoming staff. The welcoming crowd was so crowded that there was no space. A US film company had already installed a tall camera on the roof of the car. Ambassador Wang immediately thanked the crowd in Chinese and English, and the thank-you speech was recorded in a sound film. This scene of the enthusiastic welcome of Chinese overseas Chinese will soon be shown in the current affairs newsreels of American cinemas, and people across the United States can admire the demeanor of the new ambassador.</p>
<p>Wang's Reply</p>
<p>Ambassador Wang thanked everyone for the welcome and briefly reported on the situation in the country, which is making extraordinary progress. The unification, construction, and national strength have greatly increased, which is comforting to the overseas Chinese. He also said that he was very pleased to see that everything in Washington was more prosperous and progressive than the last time he came. The welcoming representatives then asked the ambassador to ride in the prepared open-top car with Counselor Rong Changwen. The two daughters rode in the welcoming car of the Chinese Kuomintang Washington, DC Branch in the lead, led by four motorcycle policemen. More than 50 welcoming cars followed in a straight line. The Sino-US flags on the cars were flying. The vehicles on the streets were waiting. The welcoming team went straight through the red light from Chinatown to the embassy. The people along the way expressed their enthusiasm. For a time, there were many carriages and horses at the Chinese Embassy. Ambassador Wang was welcomed into the embassy by the welcoming staff. Counselor Ying introduced everyone and shook hands with the new ambassador to express their welcome. They were served with tea and refreshments, and the representatives took a photo with Ambassador Wang. Then, Ambassador Wang thanked everyone again in the hall, first in Mandarin and then in Cantonese, conveying the Sino-Historical Virtue and Italy, and expressing sympathy for the hardships of the overseas Chinese. Then, he encouraged the overseas Chinese in three matters: ㊀ Learn Mandarin to communicate ideas and strengthen unity. It can be successful in March. ㊁ Promote the New Life Movement and promote the integration of the Chinese nation. Depart from the station. There are many vehicles parked left, right, front and rear, connected like dark clouds. After four o'clock, more than 100 people had arrived and stood upright at the east gate to greet them. Chinese overseas Chinese representatives Li Zhongmi, Mei Wei, Li Xingshou, Hong Zhenxiang, student association representatives Li Xingchuan, Yang Rujin, etc., and a group of people welcomed the US State Department's Far East Director Han Bok, Deputy Director Hamilton, and the embassy representative Mei Yao, as well as the attaché Rong Gui, leading all the embassy staff and their families, had all arrived at the station to wait respectfully. Ambassador Wang's Chinese and foreign friends were also crowded on the platform. In addition, Embassy Secretary He and his wife and Consul General Yu of New York had gone to the previous station in the United States and Germany in advance, and sought intelligent career lives. ㊂ For the cooperation of all sectors, overseas Chinese businessmen, students, and government personnel must work together with one heart and one mind to gather the strength of the people to promote the construction of the country. After the performance, the crowd applauded continuously. Since there has been a Chinese Embassy, it can be said that Washington, DC overseas Chinese have rarely welcomed diplomatic officials. This time, it can be said that Ambassador Wang's Cantonese is very pure and fluent, and his speech is cordial, which makes the overseas Chinese feel more emotional and celebrate the acquisition of talents. Ambassador Wang has also scheduled to attend the All-Overseas Chinese Welcoming Conference on June 6, and it is expected that there will be a more lively scene. It is also understood that the Chinese Students' Association has planned to open a Mandarin class and teach Mandarin free of charge. The date of Ambassador Wang's presentation of credentials is being negotiated with the US State Department.</p>
<p>Shi's Departure from the United States</p>
<p>Dr. Shi Zhaoji, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, has been stationed abroad for more than 20 years. He has served as the Chinese Minister to the United Kingdom twice and the Chinese Minister to the United States twice. In 1935, the Chinese and American envoys were promoted to become the first Chinese Ambassador to the United States, dedicating his efforts to the altar and making outstanding contributions. He has a strong friendship with international people. Since the news of his return to China last year spread, various parties have successively held farewell banquets. Recently, US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, the US State Department's relevant departments, and British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay, as well as the envoys from various countries, all held farewell banquets for him. At 11:55 am on May 24, Ambassador Shi, along with Mrs. Shi and his daughter, Miss Alice, First Secretary Lao Weixiu, left Washington, DC by car. Those who came to the station to see him off included Russian Ambassador Troyanovsky and his staff, Japanese Ambassador Saito and his wife and staff, Siamese Minister Nai Jametri and his wife, Egyptian Minister Bey, as well as personnel from the US State Department's Far East Department, and representatives from more than 10 overseas Chinese organizations in Washington, DC, totaling more than 50 people. The Russian Ambassador was especially reluctant to part, because the two of them were not only close friends but also opponents in sports and entertainment. Ambassador Shi planned to meet with the new Ambassador Wang in Chicago the next day to exchange welcome and farewell greetings, and then return to China from San Francisco on the President Hoover. He will arrive in Shanghai on June 15. Ambassador Shi's two sons are currently working as doctors and in the banking sector in Shanghai. His eldest daughter is studying painting in New York, his second daughter is studying at Cornell University, and his third daughter is currently studying in the United Kingdom. Former First Secretary Huang Pijie is expected to return to China after the new secretary arrives and deals with the affairs. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai in early June. The embassy's affairs are currently being handled temporarily by Counselor Ying Shangde.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Establish a Wool Nation Policy in the Northeast</h3>
<p>Raising Sheep as a Side Business for Immigrants, Ministry of Colonial Affairs is Actively Promoting</p>
<p>Changchun Correspondence The Japan-Manchukuo Wool Sheep Association, established by Japan in the Northeast, plans to purchase 1,000 Merino sheep from New Zealand and 2,000 from Australia (Corriedale breed) in late July this year, and set up a large breeding farm of 5,000 hectares in Linkou Nan, 3,000 kilometers away, to increase the number of Merino sheep to 15,000 as a side business for immigrants. Taro Taho, Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Division of the Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs, once came to Changchun for this reason. According to him, the Corriedale Merino sheep have been raised for three years and the results are quite good. Therefore, it is planned to buy 3,000 heads this year and 2,000 heads next year to raise in the Northeast to help solve Japan's wool nation policy. Moreover, the Japanese Ministry of Colonial Affairs plans to actively promote and guide this in the future to seek diversification of agricultural management, and will also cross Mongolian sheep with Corriedale Merino sheep or improve them. Also, because the climate in the Northeast is suitable, it is believed that future development can be predicted.</p>
<h3>Guangzhou Merchants Urge the Restoration of the Currency Trading Market</h3>
<p>—Simultaneously Organize a Currency and Securities Exchange—</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence The Guangzhou currency trading market has been closed for nearly a month since the Ministry of Finance ordered its closure. Most merchants feel that it is inconvenient to buy and sell futures. Large merchants trade tens of thousands of yuan every month. If they do not first purchase futures, then "foreign exchange fluctuations will greatly affect the price of goods, and indirectly they will inevitably suffer losses. The Silver Industry Association has been petitioning for days by merchants to restore the silver market and has submitted it to the Finance Department for approval. However, the Finance Department believes that this move is to implement the Ministry of Finance's order and it is difficult to approve the request. Therefore, representatives from more than 60 industry associations, such as pawnshops, restaurants, tea houses, gold and silver shops, rice bran shops, miscellaneous grain shops, peanut sesame shops, sugar and noodle industries, rice milling industries, customs declaration industries, fresh fish wholesale industries, Chinese medicine industries, automobile industries, Chinese cigarette industries, copper and iron industries, etc., specially convened a meeting on the 5th of this month. First, the chairman reported that since the closure of the silver market, all industries have been unable to stabilize the price of goods and exchange procedures. Operators have no fixed budget and the price of goods is often affected by exchange rates, so it is urgent to petition the authorities to find a way to provide relief. The representatives of more than 60 industries unanimously agreed to appeal to the authorities again. The Miscellaneous Grain Association, Rice Bran Shop, Customs Declaration Shop, Sugar and Noodle Shop, etc., were jointly elected to draft a petition, detailing all the difficulties directly and indirectly suffered by all industries since the closure of the silver market, and requesting permission to restore the silver market to maintain commerce. At the same time that all industries are requesting the restoration of the silver market, the Silver Industry Association, Silver Money Exchange Industry, and other three institutions are still following the Ministry of Finance's order to prepare to organize the Guangzhou Currency and Bond Exchange, raising a share capital of 250,000 to 300,000 yuan to specialize in the purchase and sale of spot goods and the management of bonds and currencies. It is expected to be established in late this month. As for the share offering, it will be the responsibility of 25 promoters. (June 6)</p>
<h3>Ancient Tomb from the Song Dynasty Discovered in Jinshan County</h3>
<p>Jinshan News The fourth phase of the conscription training in this county takes the Xingta Town Southwest Youli Elementary School in the first district of the county as the training site, but because the playground is small and insufficient, a tomb next to the school was leveled to be used for training. Unexpectedly, at 10 am on the 10th, when workers were digging, a bottom-level tomb passage was discovered in the middle of the tomb, all made of ancient bricks. Each brick weighed about 30 pounds. On one side of its length, the words "Jingding First Year" were engraved. A coffin was then discovered in the east corner of the tomb passage, painted with porcelain paint, and the sound of it was clanging. The cover also had the words "Jingding First Year."

<h3>Crackdown on the Headquarters of a Major Drug Lord</h3>
<p>Drug Manufacturing Headquarters Previously Uncovered; Dan Pengxiang Still Lurking on the Border of Shanxi and Henan; Wu Yongwen Captured and Sent to Jie County for Interrogation</p>
<p>Zhengzhou Dispatch: Dan Pengxiang, a major drug manufacturer operating on the border of Henan, Shanxi, and Hebei provinces, had previously secretly established a drug manufacturing facility in a kiln in Tie Village, which is under the jurisdiction of Bo'ai County in Henan Province. He colluded with unscrupulous individuals to transport and sell drugs externally, harming the local area for many years. In October, the 8th Team of the Mountain Anti-Smoking and Anti-Drug Inspection Team stationed in Jincheng raided his headquarters, seizing a large quantity of drug manufacturing equipment, firearms, and ammunition. Dan had been secretly informed by his henchmen beforehand and fled immediately. However, he remained unrepentant, and continued to gather his gang in the mountains along the border of Shanxi and Henan to manufacture Dan Peng (a type of drug). He also risked transporting his old stock at night in different directions to Jincheng in an attempt to make a hefty profit. This was discovered by the original investigators, who sent a team of soldiers in disguise to conduct a secret investigation along the way. They discovered that the home of Wu Yongwen in Gaotie Village, which is under the jurisdiction of Jincheng County, was the new headquarters for manufacturing Dan Peng. They raided the location and found a large quantity of drug manufacturing materials, equipment, chemicals, and ledgers hidden in the newly papered window sills in the room. The suspect, Wu Yongwen, has been sent to the Jincheng County government for interrogation, and additional troops have been dispatched to continue the strict search for the remaining gang members in order to eliminate the poisonous atmosphere.

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Dried Cocoons Transported to Wuxi for Reeling</p>
<p>The current spring cocoon market is coming to an end. Most of the fresh cocoons collected by various silk manufacturers have been dried and transported to Wuxi for reeling. However, some cocoon businesses speculated largely when collecting cocoons, resulting in the cocoon business operated by Xue Zhanxuan, the cocoon industry trust, not competing with other businesses due to the limitation of the cocoon price standard (44 to 37 yuan). Therefore, the number of cocoons collected is insufficient. It will not be possible to uniformly weigh them until after the Dragon Boat Festival. The businesses that collected the most cocoons this time collected more than 1,000 dan, the average was 400 to 500 dan, and the least was 30 to 40 dan. It is heard that the price of silk has recently increased to 20 yuan, with foreign firms offering 840 yuan per dan, which is 75 to 83 cents. However, considering the cost, there are still losses. User silk is quoted at 820 yuan per dan for 20 to 22 cents, and trading is still active.</p>

<h3>Cheng Tiangu and Others Arrive in Shanghai to Investigate the Yarn Exchange; New Trading Suspended Yesterday</h3>
<p>Vice Minister Cheng Calls Yarn Brokers for Talks to Discuss Measures; Cracking Down on Speculators to Protect Cotton Yarn Manufacturers</p>
<p>The Supervisory Yuan also Sends Personnel to Shanghai for Thorough Investigation; Trading Suspended for Holidays Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange experienced disputes due to the unusual rise in yarn prices. After mediation by Du Yuesheng and others, prices returned to normal the day before yesterday and people's hearts gradually calmed down. However, the opening auction yesterday morning was forced to stop again. The exchange issued an emergency notice to suspend new trading in all months' futures. Deputy Minister Cheng Tiangu and others arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and summoned the brokers' association and both the long and short sides to investigate the manipulation of speculators. Today is the weekly holiday and tomorrow is a compensatory holiday for the Dragon Boat Festival, so trading is temporarily suspended. It is confirmed that the Supervisory Yuan has also specially appointed commissioners to come to Shanghai tonight to investigate the truth. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Auction Forced to Stop Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>After Du Yuesheng and others intervened to mediate the auction of cotton yarn at the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange, it was decided to maintain the price below the market price on the 8th (i.e., 295 yuan for June delivery) for five days. Therefore, the auction resumed from the day before yesterday. As a result, the long side initially accepted the mediation and sold 29,950 bales of cotton yarn, causing prices to fall back and people's hearts to gradually calm down. However, the major accounts on the long side still refused to sell, so trading was forced to stop again at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. Both cotton yarn and cotton were marked with a black plate. Trading was still forced to stop when the auction opened at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, and cotton yarn and cotton were still marked with a black plate. The market situation has therefore become more chaotic.</p>
<p>Notice to Suspend New Futures Trading</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market revealed No. 2018, stating, "In accordance with the provisions of Article 157, Section 13 of the Exchange's Business Rules, new buying and selling of cotton yarn and cotton in each month's futures will be suspended from today. In addition to notifying the Brokers' Association, this notice is hereby issued." The original text of Article 157, Section 13, as recorded by the New Sound News Agency reporter, is as follows: "The Exchange may suspend all or part of the trading sessions or restrict brokers and agents from entering the premises when one of the following situations occurs: ㊀ When the Exchange considers the market price to be unstable at the time of rise and fall, or when it believes that there is an abnormal change or an unstable trend; ㊁ When the Exchange believes that a broker has unstable or improper trading behavior, or has deliberately disrupted the market; ㊂ When the Exchange believes that there are obstacles in the delivery; ㊃ When the Exchange believes that there are obstacles in the collection of transaction evidence money; ㊄ In addition to the above items, when the Exchange deems it necessary. When the Exchange believes that one of the above circumstances exists and suspends trading sessions or restricts brokers and agents from entering the premises, it is not obliged to explain the reasons, even if there is a public announcement.</p>
<p>Cheng Tiangu Makes a Statement Yesterday</p>
<p>Cheng Tiangu, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, Chen Yu, the Counselor, and Kuang Yunwen, the Section Chief, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning. Du Yuesheng, the president of the Local Association, Wang Xiaolai, the supervisor of the Exchange, and Mu Ouchu, the chairman of the Shanghai Chinese Cotton Yarn Exchange, visited them successively yesterday afternoon to report on the soaring price of cotton yarn in the Yarn Exchange and the mediation process. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency visited Vice Minister Cheng at 6:00 PM yesterday evening, who made the following statement: "The purpose of this investigation by the Ministry of Industry is to crack down on the manipulation of yarn prices by speculators and the disruption of the agricultural, industrial, and market scene. The legitimate interests of cotton yarn manufacturers will be absolutely guaranteed. This matter is of great importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, as well as to the financial markets. The Ministry of Industry, as the highest governing body, must handle it with prudence. At present, we will start by thoroughly investigating the truth from all sides and make a concrete decision after careful consideration."</p>
<p>The Brokers' Association Elects Representatives</p>
<p>The Brokers' Association of the Yarn Exchange convened a general meeting of members at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, chaired by Vice President Shao Wenmei, to report on the market situation after the mediation by Du Yuesheng and others.

They went to Xinya Restaurant at 4:00 PM. The meeting adjourned at about 10:00 PM.</p>
<p>Calling on Brokers for Talks</p>
<p>Cheng Tiangu, the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, convened a meeting at the Xinya Restaurant at 4:00 PM yesterday afternoon, along with Wang Xiaolai, the supervisor of the Exchange, the two vice presidents of the Brokers' Association, and representatives of the long and short side brokers. ㊀ Association Representatives Shao Wenmei and Zhou Shaokang reported on the market situation and requested fair handling. ㊁ Short Side Representatives Zhu Wenqi and Zhang Boguan stated that the strong side was manipulating the market and requested investigation. ㊂ Long Side Representatives Wu Wenqi and Pan Shouzhi stated that the price of yarn was soaring because demand exceeded supply. Finally, Vice Minister Cheng instructed the long side to find ways to maintain the market, and the long side agreed to go back and discuss with the traders and reply at 10:00 AM tomorrow (Monday). The meeting adjourned at about 6:00 PM.</p>

<h3>My Consul General in Medan, Huang Tianmai, Returned to China and Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>It is said that the economy of overseas Chinese has improved and domestic products can be promoted; Sino-Dutch trade is gradually flourishing, and overseas Chinese eagerly hope for the signing of a trade agreement.</p>
<p>My consul general stationed in Medan, Nanyang, Huang Tianmai, has served there for four years. He has now received an order from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be promoted to Consul General in Paris, France. He took his family and others on the French postal ship "Champollion" to return to China a few days ago, and arrived in Shanghai at 2 pm yesterday. Those who went to welcome him included Wang Chonghui's secretary Xiao Jinfang and his wife, Wei Daoming's secretary Peng Zhihua, and Qi Dazhi from the Port Quarantine Office, and other people. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency interviewed Huang at the ship yesterday. According to Huang, Medan is on the north bank of Sumatra and is the only major city on the island. About 40,000 Chinese reside in the city, mostly engaged in the business of local products, with some also working as intermediaries. Their lives are generally sustainable. The total number of overseas Chinese in Sumatra is about 400,000. In recent years, the Nanyang economy has gradually recovered, and the price of rubber and other products has increased, allowing the overseas Chinese economy to recover slightly, showing improvement compared to three or four years ago. Looking at the efforts and management of the overseas Chinese, the future is still promising. Currently, there is a great demand for domestic products in Nanyang, and Chinese handicrafts can also be promoted there. The overseas Chinese all love to use them. However, the only reason why the trade of domestic products cannot be fully developed is that the Dutch East Indies has import restrictions, and domestic products cannot be imported continuously, creating an imbalance. At that time, the reporter inquired about the Sino-Dutch trade agreement. According to Huang, trade between China and the Dutch East Indies has increased in recent years, making it necessary to negotiate a trade agreement. Because of the import restrictions, the overseas Chinese are particularly eager for the negotiation of a trade agreement. During my stay in Singapore, I heard that the Director of Commerce of the Economic Department of the Dutch East Indies government intended to negotiate with China, but our consulate had not yet received orders from the government. Huang also spoke with a joyful expression about the overseas Chinese's concept of the motherland. He said that Chinese people have a strong sense of attachment to their homeland, and the overseas Chinese in the South Seas cherish it even more. The overseas Chinese are concerned and attentive to everything, big or small, in the motherland. For example, during the Xi'an Incident that occurred and was resolved last year, the overseas Chinese devoted all their attention to it. Finally, they set off firecrackers to celebrate the danger being averted and to support the leader enthusiastically. In summary, the future of overseas Chinese in Nanyang is still promising, and domestic products can be promoted. Huang also mentioned that he had served in Paris several years ago, and now he has been ordered to be transferred there, and will revisit the old place. He will first go to Beijing to meet Foreign Minister Wang to report everything, and then plans to go to France to take up his new post in two months.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Authorities Are Actively Preparing to Build a Municipal Auditorium and Crematorium</h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee for the North-South Municipal Auditorium Will Hold a Meeting; the Crematorium Will Be Built as Soon as Sufficient Funds Are Raised.</p>
<p>In order to promote social undertakings in the city, the municipal authorities plan to build a public auditorium and crematorium. It is now learned that the plan is actively underway, the drawings have been drafted, and construction will begin as soon as sufficient funds are raised. A reporter from the Zhengzhou News Agency made a special trip to investigate the details as follows:</p>
<p>Public Auditoriums in the North and South Municipalities</p>
<p>The plan to build public auditoriums in the city has been determined for a long time. The municipal authorities, considering that the current population of the South Municipality is 617,573, and the population of Zhabei has reached 697,194, such a large number of citizens, if there are weddings, funerals, or celebrations, have to rent space in hotels, restaurants, or temples. Not only is it impossible to be completely solemn in terms of etiquette, but it is also inevitable to waste money in terms of economy. Therefore, the municipal authorities have decided to build an auditorium in both the South Municipality and Zhabei, each auditorium accommodating 500 people at a time. This plan, during the tenure of Mayor Wu Tiecheng, was originally intended to be realized in the middle of last year, but it could not be started immediately because the funds had not yet been raised. After Deputy Mayor Yu took office, he paid great attention to the promotion of the New Life Movement, and recognized that the establishment of municipal auditoriums was closely related to the promotion of the New Life Movement in the city. Therefore, he recently consulted with the Preparatory Committee for the North-South Auditoriums to urge its early realization. The drawings have been drafted, the construction site for the Zhabei Auditorium is between Baotong Road and Qiujiang Road, and the site for the South Municipality Auditorium is being surveyed. It is also learned that the Preparatory Committee for the North-South Auditoriums will convene a joint meeting in the coming days to discuss everything.</p>
<p>Construction of Crematoriums in Pudong and Puxi</p>
<p>In order to improve the appearance of the city and take into account land and public health, the municipal government plans to build a crematorium in both Pudong and Puxi. Qu Wenliu, Guan Jiongzhi, Huang Hanzhi, Ye Gongchuo, Cai Jinjun, Li Ting'an, Shen Qia, and Wang Changchun have been successively appointed to the Shanghai Crematorium Preparatory Committee. It is now learned that after active planning by all parties, considerable funds have been raised for the crematorium, which will be built at the same time as the North-South Municipal Auditoriums.</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng Will Change His Visit to the North to Early Next Month</h3>
<p>It was reported that Wu Tiecheng, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, would come to the North in the coming days to go to Lushan to report to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek on his duties. It is now learned that Wu will stay in Guangdong to entertain Song Ziwen, who will be going to Guangdong soon, and discuss the development of Hainan Island and the construction of Guangdong Province. The departure date has been postponed, and he will not be able to come to the North until the end of this month or early next month.</p>
<h3>Five Journalists Came to China on the 5th</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily, the representatives of the Sasebo Shimbun journalists, Kiyokatsu Hirai, a resident correspondent of the Osaka Asahi in Sasebo, Takeo Yoshinaga of the Osaka Mainichi, Kiichi Takashima of the Sasebo Shimbun, Takao Sano of the Sasebo Naval Port Shimbun, and Hitoshi Nikko of the Fukuoka Nichifuku, a total of five people, came to Shanghai on the warship Izumo on the 11th to investigate the current situation in China. On the evening of the 11th, they attended a banquet hosted by the naval attache of the Japanese Embassy and socialized with local Japanese newspaper reporters and officials of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Organization of the Four-Province Agricultural Products Joint Transportation Office</h3>
<p>Prepared by the Agricultural Movement Stock of the Jiangsu Bank</p>
<p>Recently, the banking industry in China has been investing more and more in rural areas, and the rural economy has been recovering as a result. After the local banks of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi provinces began exchanging remittances with each other in July, the farmers of the four provinces have benefited a lot. Recently, the local banks of the four provinces, in view of the full opening of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway at the end of October, which will allow the traffic of the four provinces to be fully connected, initiated the organization of a Joint Marketing Office for Agricultural Products of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi Provinces. Each bank has sent representatives to gather at the Shanghai branch of the Jiangsu Bank to hold a joint meeting to discuss the matters to be carried out. It has been agreed that, before the official establishment, the preparation matters will be temporarily handled by the Agricultural Movement Stock of the Shanghai Branch of the Jiangsu Bank.</p>
<h3>The Press Went to Beijing Last Night to Visit the Handicraft Exhibition</h3>
<p>The National Handicraft Exhibition has been open in the capital for many days, and more than 20 provinces and cities have selected exhibits. The number of visitors has been very large, which can be described as a grand event. The Ministry of Industry has specially invited the Shanghai press to visit Beijing. It is learned that members of the Shanghai Daily Newspaper Association, including Wang Jilu, Zhu Mingxin, Xu Xinyi, Qu Gengshan, Teng Shugu, Pan Yihua, Chen Lusi, Guo Xiufeng, Wang Songnian, and Shu Zongqiao, took the Shanghai-Beijing night express train to Beijing last night (the 12th) and will visit the exhibition today.</p>
<h3>Group Discounts for Two Railway Lines to the National Handicraft Exhibition</h3>
<p>Additional Cars Can Be Arranged in Advance</p>
<p>Since the opening of the National Handicraft Exhibition on May 10 at the National Art Gallery on Guofu Road in the capital, people from inside and outside the capital have been visiting the exhibition to visit or purchase local specialties. The exhibition period is scheduled for one month, which will soon be over. It is learned that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, in order to give preferential treatment to the large number of visitors along the line and to serve the initial meeting, any student groups with 10 or more people, or ordinary groups with 20 or more people, can enjoy the benefits of discounts according to the group ticket method. If the number of people is large and additional cars are required, you can contact the railway in advance.</p>
<h3>Active Overseas Silk Sales, Silk Factories Started Work One After Another</h3>
<p>Poor Spring Cocoon Harvest, Insufficient Raw Materials for Reeling; Authorities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Promote Feeding Green Summer Silkworms</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province's spring cocoons went on the market earlier than Jiangsu Province's, so they were all weighed and completely ended at the end of last month. However, the Jiangsu Province side was slower to start. For example, cocoon shops in Wuxi, Suzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Liyang, Changzhou, and Jiangyin, etc., were only completely stopped a few days ago. However, because the season was not right this year, all reported poor harvests. In Zhejiang Province, improved varieties accounted for 60%, and native cocoons accounted for 40%. The situation in Jiangsu Province was similar. However, most of the cocoons needed by Shanghai silk factories are purchased from Zhejiang Province, because the production areas west of Wuxi in Jiangsu Province have been taken away by the Wuxi silk factories. Only a very small number of cocoons in the Suzhou area to the east are purchased by Shanghai silk factories, with a total amount of only 20,000 to 30,000 dan. Recently, overseas silk sales have been quite active, and silk factories in the city have started work one after another. There are 9 factories in the Zhabei District, 12 in the Xinzha District, 2 in the Concession District, 2 in the South Shanghai District, and 10 in the Hongkou District. Now, Hongchang, Gongda, and Yufeng factories in the Xinzha District, and Hete and Yuanchang, etc., 5 factories in the Zhabei District, have also started work one after another. At present, a total of 39 silk factories are operating in the city, with more than 9,500 machines, 3 fewer factories and more than 700 fewer machines than in the same period last year.</p>
<h3>Reduced Prices for Mackay Night Telegrams in the United States</h3>
<p>Shanghai Branch Set Up in Sassoon House</p>
<p>The Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company of the United States recently suggested to the Department of Transportation in Washington that the rates for night telegrams be reduced throughout the United States. The Department has approved this, and it will officially take effect on June 1. It is found that the implementation of this pricing will greatly benefit the industrial and commercial circles of the country, because according to the new pricing, the more words typed, the lower the cost. The unit is 30 words, and the cost is cheaper than the previously cancelled 10-word unit. For example, to calculate 300 words from New York to San Francisco, it only costs US$3.05 (the old method required US$6). Recently, Mackay, the president of the company, claimed that the new pricing implemented this time has opened a new era in the country's wireless and telegraph industry, and will indirectly promote the development of industry and commerce. The company has a branch in Sassoon House No. 109 in Shanghai, which can send telegrams to all parts of the world. Just indicate "Mackay" on the telegram.</p>
<h3>Free Professional Groups Host a Banquet for Income Tax Supervisors</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the National Association of Accountants, jointly with the Shanghai Accountants, Lawyers, Doctors, National Doctors, Architects, Engineers, and other free professional groups, held a public banquet for Liang Hejun, director of the Municipal Income Tax Office, Tang Wenkai, director, Huang Yisheng, Chen Jianyu and others, at the Accountants Association Hall on the 4th floor, 1454 Edward Road. More than 20 representatives of various groups attended, including Gu Weichuan, Cheng Diren, Jiang Wenfang, Xiao Tuian, Wang Sifang, Wang Haifan, Xi Yushu, Jiang Wanping, Zhang Pengjiu, Yang Zhongxuan, Zhao Zuwei, Song Guobin, Zhu Shuqia, Chen Riping, Xu Naili, Cai Yumen, Xi Fuquan, and Xu Yinghao. The public recommended accountant Xi Yushu, a representative of the Accountants Association, as chairman. During the banquet, Xi Yushu delivered a speech, briefly stating that he was honored by the visit of everyone. Regarding the income tax issue, the association had previously sent representatives to Beijing to present two opinions to the Ministry of Finance: 1. It is proposed that the income of freelancers be changed to annual settlement and payment. 2. Please reduce the tax rate for freelancers. Regarding the first point, the Ministry of Finance has completely adopted it, and it is clearly stipulated in the second category of collection instructions. However, although the second point of requesting a reduction in the tax rate is a legislative issue, all groups in the association hope that it will be adopted and ask Director Liang to forward it. Subsequently, Director Liang stood up and thanked him, briefly describing the preparations for the establishment of income tax, the collection situation, and explaining that the government's collection of income tax originally took from income with fairness as the principle. If various circles have difficulties and actual situations in this regard, they can always contact the association for reference. Furthermore, regarding the declaration and registration of freelancers, it is hoped that the representatives will inform their respective associations and notify members who have not registered to register with the Income Tax Office immediately. The rest was omitted, and the guests and hosts parted happily.</p>
<h3>Last Day of the Power Storage Sports Exhibition</h3>

Because the hall has limited seating, the association has issued admission tickets and does not charge a fee. However, viewers without tickets cannot enter the venue. It is also heard that after the closing of the Power Storage Exhibition, the association will continue to promote the various aspects of the Power Storage Movement. If people from all walks of life wish to promote this work, they can send a letter directly to the Power Storage Movement Committee of the association. The booklets "One Quarter of an Hour of Fitness Exercises for Men and Women Every Day," the power storage symbol diagrams, vertical axes, couplets, and various colored postcards are all priced extremely low for easy promotion and use.

<h3>Chen Baoxiang Specially Uses Hotels to Deceive Guide Women of Jewelry</h3>
<p>Li Woke Up from a Dream and Chen Suddenly Disappeared; Realized She Had Been Deceived and Quickly Ordered a Tea Server to Chase and Capture Him</p>
<p>Recently, a group of unemployed individuals has been opening hotel rooms specifically to hire guide women, attempting to swindle them out of their jewelry. The police have cracked down on many such cases, and guide women have become wary. However, these swindlers are very skillful, so such incidents still occur from time to time. Chen Baoxiang, a Ningbo native aged 24, is one such individual. He usually dresses in a sharp Western suit, and those unaware of his background would surely think he is a young gentleman, unaware that he is a swindler. Chen has been engaged in this kind of deception for a long time, and countless people have been deceived. On the 10th of the month, Chen went to Room 508 of the New Asia Hotel on Guizhou Road and, at 12 o'clock in the evening, called Li Ying, a female employee of the Shunfeng Guide Agency at 97 Labour Road. He used flowery words, claiming to offer a considerable price to please the woman. The woman was wearing a gold ring and a wristwatch. Chen immediately asked Li to take them off to examine their style. Li told him that she was aware of recent newspaper reports of incidents of guide women being swindled out of their jewelry, so she could not lend them. Chen immediately showed displeasure, seeming to blame Li for not trusting his character. Li, fearing to offend the guest and hinder business, agreed to lend them. It was already late at night, and Li was very tired but dared not fall asleep. When it reached 8 o'clock in the morning, she was so exhausted that she fell sound asleep. Just as she was deeply asleep, she suddenly heard the sound of the door opening and immediately woke up. Seeing that Chen was no longer in the room, she realized she had been deceived and quickly called tea servers Zheng Baokun and Li Mingde to help chase after him. Chen had already taken the elevator to the second floor and was caught by Zheng and the others. Detectives Wang Yingjie and Bao Renrui were called to arrest him and take him to the Lao Zha Police Station. In his pocket, they found the original stolen gold ring and wristwatch belonging to Li. It was discovered that Chen had previously swindled guide women from various agencies in more than ten cases, including Li Guiyun from Xin Chun, Meng Lijun from Taishan, Xiong Lili from Diantong, Zhao Lianjun from Black Cat, Gu Lingling from Laiqiao, Su Yunfang from Xin Ya, Chen Yuying from Da Zhonghua, Xu Lifang from Xujiacun, Li Aina from Shanghai Qingyi Agency, Wang Yuena from Hong Mei, Wang Ying from OK, Chen Biwen from Tianxian, and Hu Xiuzhen from Lelu, Fang Laiti Shenzhou Chen Yuzhen et al., all of whom had been deceived by Chen's trickery and lost various items of jewelry. Yesterday morning, Chen was sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division 2. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case, initially charging him under Article 339, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code for the case of deceiving Li Ying. As the remaining cases had not yet been investigated, he requested that, after questioning, he be allowed to amend the charges at a later date after further investigation. Li Ying then submitted a petition detailing the experience of being deceived. Questioned about it, Chen Baoxiang gave a cunning statement, claiming that he had borrowed them from Li Ying and had not obtained them through fraud. Although he had committed similar incidents more than ten times, he claimed that they were all voluntarily lent to him. Judge Ye Shengchao examined the confession and ordered Chen Baoxiang to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing of the Long Kneeling Marriage Scam Case Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yangzi Hotel Accounting and Tea Servers Summoned; Hu Caizhen's Age Also in Question</p>
<p>Jiang Wei Yu, a 28-year-old cattle slaughterer and small boss from Jiang Xiangxing on Gonghe Road, Zhabei, is a fashionable young man who usually dresses in Western suits and enjoys dressing up. He inherited a massive fortune from his father's estate. Although he had already taken a wife and concubine and enjoyed all kinds of pleasures, his flirtatious nature led him to frequently linger in singing halls and dance halls, eventually leading to the bankruptcy of his vast fortune. To avoid pressure from debt creditors, Jiang moved to 51 Jianye Lane, Fulilu Road, French Concession. Unexpectedly, Hu Caizhen, a dance girl from the Great China Dance Hall (18 years old), through her mother, Hu Yushi, as her legal representative, filed a complaint in the local court for endangering public morals, stating that Gao Zitong, a friend of Jiang Wei Yu, was also a friend of Hu Yushi's husband, so he often visited Hu Yushi's home for casual conversation. As Jiang had divorced his legal wife, Gao, seeing this situation, acted as a matchmaker. Jiang even knelt down to Hu Caizhen to propose marriage, which the girl immediately agreed to on the 3rd day of the 7th month of last year. Jiang then set the engagement date for the 21st of the same month. However, on the 18th, Jiang lured Hu Caizhen to the Yangzi Hotel for two nights of coitus. After Jiang achieved his pleasure, he completely forgot about the engagement and disappeared. Hu Yushi was furious and filed a lawsuit in the local court, but repeated summons were unsuccessful, so an arrest warrant was issued. Recently, Hu Yushi learned that Jiang had reconciled with his legal wife and was living together in Jianye Lane, Fulilu Road, and requested the court to ask the Second Special District Court to arrest Jiang and bring him to justice. Judge Wu Xiangzu held a trial, but as the plaintiff Hu Caizhen did not appear, the hearing was rescheduled. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., Judge Wu appeared in court for a continued hearing. Hu Caizhen appeared in court and testified that she was 18 years old, from Shaoxing, and lived at 83 Beijing Road. She met Jiang Wei Yu through Gao Zitong's introduction. On the 4th day of the 7th month, Jiang knelt down before me and proposed marriage. After I agreed, he asked me to go to the Albert Road Garden for a walk. The next day, he asked me to go to the Great Sun Company for a walk. On the evening of the 17th, he asked me to go to the Jincheng to watch a movie and lured me to Room 303 of the Yangzi Hotel for one night of coitus. On the 19th, Jiang, on the pretext of going to take photos, lured me to Room 709 of the Yangzi Hotel for coitus. On the 21st, the date of the engagement, Jiang called and asked me to go to Mei Village on Jessfield Road. Jiang said that because of bankruptcy, the marriage would be postponed and gave me a small diamond ring. Since then, he has avoided me and disappeared. I request legal action and compensation for reputational damage, etc. When questioned, Jiang Wei Yu still firmly denied it, saying that Hu's age was supposedly the year of the dragon, but she was actually 22 years old. As for my photos, they were taken by her gun, etc. At this point, Li Huqing, the accounting clerk of the Yangzi Hotel, was summoned for questioning. Because the tea server of the Yangzi Hotel had to be summoned again, and Hu Caizhen's age had to be investigated, the court ordered that the hearing be continued on June 18th at 10 a.m. The defendant Jiang Wei Yu was still remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Water Police Arrest Women Selling Prostitution on Ships</h3>
<p>Totaling Six, Plus Three "Leeches"</p>
<p>Imported foreign freighters on the Huangpu River are frequented by men under the pretense of selling alcohol, carrying several bottles of beer to sell on board, and in the meantime, introducing prostitutes to sell prostitution on the ship. The head of the customs water police took this secret activity very seriously and instructed his subordinates to strictly prohibit it in order to avoid offenses against public morals. At noon the other day, they dispatched Chinese detectives Huang Songsheng and Jin Guifu to arrest six prostitutes on the British ship (EssexManor) at the Yangshupu waterfront: ㊀ Zhang Amei, 21 years old, Shanghai native, ㊁ Wang Xiaomei, 21 years old, Huzhou native, ㊂ Chen Xiaomei, 27 years old, Changzhou native, ㊃ Li Aidi, 20 years old, Shanghai native, ㊄ Xu Lanzhen, 20 years old, Shanghai native, ㊅ Tu Xiaomei, 18 years old, Suzhou native. These young women, some of whom are quite beautiful, were immediately taken back to the police station for disposal. Guarding until 9 o'clock in the evening, Chinese detectives Hu Changqing and Shi Ajin arrested three Jiangbei men, Lü Xiaolianzi, Zhang Dexi, and Xu Shengui, who solicited prostitutes. These men call themselves "leeches" because of their ability to seduce and penetrate everywhere. They were also taken back to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Discovered Countrymen Buying Opium and Extorting Money on the Road; Arrested</h3>
<p>Chen Guirong Sentenced to Four Months of Imprisonment; Xu Yunhe Fined Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>Xu Yunhe, a Wuxi native, purchased a small package of opium weighing half an ounce at a location on North Sichuan Road at 6:30 p.m. the other day. While passing near the intersection of Mengzi Road and Wusong Road, a fellow countryman, Lu Guirong, suddenly stopped him and, under the name of Xiaowuxi, who was on the run, attempted to extort one yuan on false pretenses, resulting in a quarrel. The Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkou Police Station arrived, arrested Xu and Chen, and after questioning them, took them to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division 3. Police lawyer Qian Xun stated the case and requested investigation. When questioned, Xu Yunhe confessed that the opium was not for sale but for his own use. When questioned, Chen Guirong confessed that it was Xiaowuxi, who was on the run, who instructed him, and he was only mediating. Judge Fu Lin sentenced Chen Guirong to four months of imprisonment as a warning and fined Xu Yunhe twenty yuan. The opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Lung Patient Dies After Swallowing Opium for Treatment</h3>
<p>Jiang Meifang, a 37-year-old Jiading native and owner of the Fangji Binding Workshop at 6 Foukang Lane, North Zhejiang Road, had been suffering from lung disease recently, causing him extreme pain. Instead of seeking medical treatment, he mistakenly swallowed a small amount of opium when the disease flared up, intending to treat his symptoms himself. The other night, as the disease worsened, he still took opium, taking more than usual, resulting in deeper poisoning. The next morning, his wife saw that the situation was not good and immediately sent him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died at around 11 a.m. that day. The hospital reported it to the Huisi Police Station, which dispatched Chinese detective Shen Dehui to investigate. The body was then taken to the Phalen Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, prosecutor Song Genshan from the First Special District Local Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and others, went to the morgue to examine the body. It was determined that the deceased, Jiang Meifang, male, died of opium poisoning. The body was handed over to his wife, Jiang Zhu, for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Roofer Falls to Death While Repairing Roof</h3>
<p>The Central Dyeing Factory at 1 Tiantong Lane, Deasy Road, whose roof had deteriorated due to age, hired roofer Xiao Yousheng (40 years old, Dinghai native) to repair it. Xiao went to work the other day and, while working on the roof, accidentally lost his footing and fell from a height, injuring his brain. He was taken to Tongren Hospital by car but died of his injuries before he could be treated.

<h3>Brothel Owner Accused of Abusing After Forcing Good Women into Prostitution</h3>
<p>Wan Meijun Suffers Unbearable Hardship and Voluntarily Reports to the Police Station</p>
<p>Wan Meijun, an 18-year-old girl from Nanjing, living at 45 Dajing Road in the city, was abducted to Shanghai last year and sold to Sun Li, a Yangzhou woman (36 years old), as her adopted daughter. At that time, she used sweet words to deceive the girl. Before long, she forced her to receive guests and prostitute herself. Meijun, trapped in a cage, secretly wept. However, the brothel owner, although Meijun received guests every night, was still not satisfied and still inflicted cruelty on her every day, demanding that she receive several guests every day. As a result, Meijun suffered unbearably. Thinking to herself that she had already earned a lot of money for the brothel owner, she resolved to fight to the death. Yesterday morning at 9 a.m., taking advantage of the fact that Sun Li had not yet gotten up, she secretly went to the police station to request help. The defendant was immediately summoned and questioned. The case involved forcing a good woman into prostitution and inflicting abuse, so she was sent to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Mother and Daughter Arrested for Gathering a Crowd to Assault Someone</h3>
<p>Yu Meng, a 22-year-old woman from Shaoxing, living at 89 Wengjia Lane, and Ma Yuan, a 21-year-old woman living in Jinjiafang, were both defamed by Wu and Wu Jin, a mother and daughter living together, for having a private affair. When questioned by the Yu and Wu families, they claimed that it was Ma Yuan who spoke privately. However, Ma Yuan denied it and questioned the Yu and Wu families, which immediately turned into a scuffle at the Lao Beimen Police Station. After questioning, they were reprimanded and released. Unexpectedly, the Yu and Wu families, seeking revenge, gathered more than ten hooligans and swarmed to Quan Meng's home the other day at noon, assaulting her without asking why, causing Yu Meng to fall to the ground injured. Shen Zengrong, who was passing by, arrived, and the thugs fled. They quickly arrested the Yu and Wu mother and daughter and took them to the police station. The case involved injury, so they were sent to the court for legal action.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Watches Robbed from Clock Shop</h3>
<p>More Than Eighty Watches Robbed; One Thief Caught on the Spot with a Handgun</p>
<p>Last night at 9 p.m., four robbers suddenly broke into a clock shop at 547 Guangdong Road. Two of the robbers pulled out handguns to threaten them and robbed more than eighty watches, carrying the loot and fleeing out the door. An employee of the shop shouted "Catch the thief!" nearby.

<h3>Weng Xieyao Sues Zhou Xiaoqing and Others for Embezzlement and Breach of Trust; Not Guilty</h3>
<p>Each of the Original Charges Is Rebutted</p>
<p>Zhou Xiaoqing, shareholder and manager of the Linji Gengxin Stage in Niuzhuang Road, and Hu Jingan, accountant, were recently sued in the First Special District Court by shareholder Weng Xieyao for breach of trust and embezzlement. The case has been summoned twice and has been reported in this newspaper. After being charged, Zhou et al. immediately hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to submit a defense, refuting each of the charges made by the plaintiff. ㊀ Of the three shares recognized by the plaintiff, in addition to the 2,500 yuan paid at the time, the remaining 500 yuan was borrowed from the defendant and was not, as the plaintiff claimed, transferred from two loans to the capital. ㊁ The defendant previously spent 30,000 yuan to buy the costumes and scenery from Zhao Jintang and Wang Yongshan of the Samsung Stage. Later, at the request of the shareholders, they were only valued at 15,000 yuan. If they were not worth it, wouldn't the shareholders object? The entire group agreed, as evidenced by the minutes of the shareholders' meeting. ㊂ The scenery wages are the wages of the scenery workers hired, totaling 62 workers. The annual wage is 12,208 yuan, 8 jiao and 7 fen. After paying 10,739 yuan, 7 jiao and 7 fen, there is still 1,469 yuan, 7 jiao owed, as well as electricity and other expenses, all of which can be verified by account books and invoices. ㊃ Freight refers to the cost of transporting goods and the travel expenses of the actors. The plaintiff claimed that it was the transportation of private goods, which is not appropriate. ㊄ The entertainment expenses include the cost of treating guests, theater tickets, and New Year's Eve events within a year, and all major expenditures were approved by the shareholders and handled by the shareholders. The entertainment expenses paid by the plaintiff also amounted to 1,305 yuan, so the plaintiff's attack on this point is deliberately unreasonable. ㊅ The actors' salaries are all evidenced by account books, and many of them are filled by shareholders, so the plaintiff's claim is obviously a deliberate misrepresentation of the facts and should be declared innocent. Yesterday afternoon, Judge He Lin opened the criminal court again to summon the case, and the plaintiff's lawyer claimed that the plaintiff now understood everything about the defendant, so he requested that the court rule according to law. When questioned, Zhou Xiaoqing confessed that what I did was evidenced by account books or minutes of the shareholders' meeting, and there was no fraudulent behavior. Judge Fu examined the confession and declared in court that Zhou Xiaoqing and Hu Jingan were not guilty.</p>
<h3>Wife Sues for Divorce Because Husband Suffers from Mental Illness</h3>
<p>Unable to Mediate Because One Party Was Not Present; Official Believes It Is Not Established and Orders Another Lawsuit</p>
<p>Yang Guizhen, a young woman from Changzhou, 19 years old, of beautiful appearance, married Cheng Qiaosheng, an Anhui native living at 38 Ningkang Lane, Fangxie Road, Nanshi, through a matchmaker in June of last year. Recently, Yang Guizhen suddenly hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit with the Local Court to divorce her husband, stating that Cheng Qiaosheng suffered from mental illness and had been treated, but all attempts to cure him failed, and he was sent back. The family also does not care for her livelihood, and she has no hope for her future happiness. Therefore, she filed for divorce and requested compensation for mental distress of 600 yuan, as well as the return of all her dowry items. After receiving the complaint, the court opened the court yesterday by Judge Qian, only the plaintiff Yang Guizhen appeared in court to state the previous situation. The judge said that it was impossible to mediate and believed that it was not established, so he ordered another formal lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Russian Boloxin Sentenced for Running Gambling Den and Taking a Cut</h3>
<p>Nineteen Gamblers Each Fined Twenty Yuan</p>
<p>Boloxin, a Russian, opened a Fan Liksi liquor stall at 424 Deasy Road.

The police station discovered that he was taking a cut from the gambling for profit and sent the police to arrest the nineteen gambling offenders, including Yun Silin, along with the boss Boloxin and the gambling equipment, and sent them to the Local Court. Prosecutor Kong Xianglin interrogated them and filed a public prosecution. Judge Bai Dongling opened the court for trial, which concluded in the case. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., Judge Bai appeared in court to pronounce the sentence. The twenty defendants, including Boloxin, were present in court. The judge questioned them one by one about their age and origin, and then pronounced the sentence: Boloxin was fined 120 yuan for running a gambling den and taking a cut for profit, and the nineteen gamblers, including Yun Silin, were each fined 20 yuan as a warning.

<h3>Trial Opens in the Case of Wu Zhihao Accused of Marriage Fraud, Seduction, and Malicious Abandonment</h3>
<p>Wang He Ying Testifies in Tears About Being Violated; Court Orders Rescheduling Pending Retrieval and Review of Files</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao, from Fenghua, former general manager of the Ningbo Industrial Bank Shanghai National Goods Company, was a school director of the Yangzhi Primary School at the intersection of Fujian Road and Nanjing Road in 1933. Seeing that Wang He Ying, a female teacher at the school from Cixi, his hometown (26 years old this year, currently living at 3 Zhaofang Lane, Zhaojia Road, Ximen), was beautiful, he pursued her. After a relationship developed, her husband, Xu Shiping, discovered it and the couple immediately agreed to divorce. Wu immediately rented 5 Ronghua Lane, Milu Road, Fangbanqiao, French Concession, and lived with her. The following year, she gave birth to a son named Yuanxin (4 years old this year). Wu gave the woman a book and paid her 100 yuan a month for living expenses from the Ningbo Industrial Bank. In the autumn of 1935, Wu Zhihao suddenly abandoned Wang He Ying and her child and stopped providing living expenses. In the winter of last year, Wang He Ying and her son Yuanxin hired a lawyer to file a self-accusation against Wu Zhihao in the Criminal Court of the First Special District for seduction and abandonment. After a trial, the court ruled that it did not have jurisdiction and ordered the case to be filed with the court with jurisdiction. The previous reports have been recorded. Now, Wang He Ying claims that she lived with Wu at 5 Ronghua Lane, Milu Road, which is in the French Concession, so she still filed a lawsuit in her own name and as the legal representative of Yuanyuan, hired another lawyer to file a self-accusation against Wu Zhihao in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District for marriage fraud, seduction, and malicious abandonment, requesting investigation according to law, and incidentally filed a civil lawsuit to recover the mother and child's living expenses and children's education expenses, 100 yuan per month, calculated for 30 years, totaling 36,000 gold yuan. The court took the lawsuit, stating that the self-accusation lawsuit stated that the defendant's criminal jurisdiction was in various hotels, and the criminal law articles cited in the lawsuit had doubts. Therefore, yesterday, Liao, head of the Criminal Court, appeared in Criminal Court 1 and summoned the plaintiff Wu Wang He Ying and the lawyer for questioning and investigation. According to Wu Wang He Ying, holding her beloved son Wu Yuanxin, she testified in tears that when she was a teacher at Yangzhi Primary School, the defendant was a school director and pursued her. In February 1933, the first relationship occurred at the Dongya Hotel. He first said that he did not have a wife and was willing to marry me. Afterwards, they often met at the hotel. On August 3 of that year, I did not return home one night. The next day, my husband, Xu Shiping, discovered my actions and wanted to kill me with a knife. I ran out to find Wu Zhihao. He asked me to divorce my husband, so on August 5, he asked lawyer Wu Kaisheng to handle my divorce from my husband, with the expenses all borne by the defendant. On the 10th of the same month, he moved to 5 Ronghua Lane, Milu Road, and lived together, giving me a book and taking 100 yuan a month from the Ningbo Industrial Bank for daily expenses. In May 1935, the defendant stopped supplying expenses, and no one came. I had no choice but to file a lawsuit with the First Special District Court to request mediation. The defendant sent someone to mediate and reduced the monthly expenses to 60 yuan, and paid 300 yuan, and the daily expenses were paid. Three months later, I was cut off and could not maintain it, so in October I moved to my mother's house in Ximen, and my current life is very difficult, and I have hemoptysis and cannot make a living, etc. Then, her lawyer quoted the criminal law articles in succession. The court ordered that the case be rescheduled to 2 p.m. on the 19th, pending retrieval and review of the files from the First Special District Court before further interrogation.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Third Session of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China</h3>
<p>Imprisonment is a serious matter. It concerns the lives of the people and the prestige of the nation. Investigations have laws, decisions have comparisons, corpses have verdicts, and punishment is used to stop punishment. Only clarity is trustworthy. In the past, the Grand Secretary of Zhou placed the Lung Stone to reach the impoverished people. Emperor Xuan of Han ordered Kong Guang and fourteen others to patrol the world as Prime Minister and Censor, managing and redressing wrongful imprisonments. Emperor Guangwu restored the country and sent envoys to redress wrongful imprisonments. The Taishi era established the Jin dynasty and issued decrees for inspection and inquiry. Emperor Wu of Liang restored the Lung Stone Box, and Chen Wu established the Wrongful Imprisonment Bureau. Emperor Kaihuang followed the Northern Wei dynasty's system of the Drum of Appeal to reach the people's grievances. Emperor Zhenguan inherited the Yan Han dynasty's established rules for recording prisoners and examined wrongful imprisonments in the imperial court. From the Song, Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming dynasties up to the Qing dynasty, they all followed the Sui dynasty's old system, establishing the Drum of Appeal Institute. Those who were wrongly accused or implicated and eventually obtained redress, Meng Cuo was executed, Emperor Jing of Han mourned for him, the Filial Daughter was wrongly accused, and Dingguo sacrificed to her. Emperor Hui of Jin praised and enfeoffed Wei Guan, and Huyan Mo posthumously honored the widow. Yonghui redressed Liu Bozhi's wrongful imprisonment, restoring his official position and bestowing titles. Kaiyuan vindicated Liu Shuang's injustice, issuing an edict to grant him a sacrificial burial. Emperor Gaozong of Song gave money and rice to those who were innocent to return home. The Ming law added the falsely accused crime to the accuser and also ordered compensation for expenses and redemption of property, all recorded and registered as models. This is the source of the Chinese legal system that has been established between heaven and earth for thousands of years. As the world declined and morality waned, punishment became chaotic and governance lax. Lenience and severity were unbalanced. Officials specialized in personal gain, and jailers privately made decisions. Xia Ping lamented the breath of accumulated injustices, and the Officer of Punishments was grieved by the souls of those who died in prison. The people's hearts turned away, gradually losing the former rules. In recent years, political systems have changed repeatedly, moving towards great unity. Now that unification is complete and a new beginning is made with the people, without an order to rectify the chaos, how can the hope of recovery be consoled? It is appropriate to quickly follow the established case of the National Judicial Conference, urgently based on the former Acting Wrongful Imprisonment Relief system, and consider the established rules of collective responsibility of various countries. Considering the current situation and local conditions, the people are lazy, quickly issue the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law of the Republic of China, so that we can celebrate the year of abundance and brevity, and eliminate the sighs of the seven losses in the Han Dynasty. Legal rights will be asserted, and national trust will be established. This Association gathers the heart and strength of lawyers nationwide. On the occasion of the third Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement, we are willing to emulate the spirit of the German Lawyers Association in its continuous thirty-year struggle, vowing to fight for social justice and legal benefits, seeking the realization of a national compensation system. Fellow countrymen, let us join forces and work together.</p>
<h3>Japan's Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation System</h3>
<p>— Zhang Bingjun</p>
<p>Japan's wrongful imprisonment compensation system began with the Criminal Compensation Law promulgated on April 2, 1931, i.e., the sixth year of the Showa era. The law was implemented on July 1 of the same year and has 20 articles. Compared to Germany, Austria, France, Italy, and other countries, it can be said to have a roughly complete scale. Although its content is not worth mentioning, it can be borrowed as a reference and as an aid to research, and there are many such aspects. Therefore, its essentials are summarized to fill the Special Publication.</p>
<p>㊀ Scope of Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation: Japan's Criminal Compensation Law is not limited to judicial wrongful imprisonments. The provisions also apply mutatis mutandis to those declared innocent by military courts. Regarding the scope of compensation, one is the loss suffered from the execution of a sentence or detention, and the other is the loss suffered from detention before the judgment is finalized in the usual procedure of the Code of Criminal Procedure, by those who are declared innocent or not prosecuted through retrial or extraordinary appeal.</p>
<p>㊁ Request for Compensation and its Procedures: The request for compensation should be made to the court that declared the innocence and to the court to which the preliminary trial judge who issued the non-prosecution decision belongs.</p>
<p>The aforementioned request shall be made in writing and must be accompanied by a copy of the household registration.</p>
<p>㊂ Method of Compensation: The method of compensation is as follows: (1) For compensation due to detention, a compensation of up to five yuan per day is given according to the actual number of days of detention. The same applies to compensation for the execution of penal servitude and imprisonment. (2) For the bereaved family of those who have been executed by the death penalty, in addition to the compensation for detention, the court shall determine an appropriate amount for compensation. (3) For compensation due to the execution of a fine, the paid fine shall be returned. (4) For compensation due to the confiscation of criminal objects, if the confiscated objects have not been damaged or discarded, the confiscated objects shall be returned. If the confiscated objects have already been disposed of and cannot be returned, the amount obtained from the disposal of the confiscated objects shall be compensated.</p>
<p>㊃ Inheritance of the Right to Claim Compensation: (1) If the person entitled to compensation has died, the compensation shall be paid to the bereaved family. The same applies when the deceased is declared innocent through retrial or extraordinary appeal. (2) If the person entitled to compensation dies after the request, the request made during his lifetime shall be deemed to be a request made by the person in the order of priority of the bereaved family. (3) When the bereaved family member entitled to compensation dies, compensation shall be paid according to the order of priority of the bereaved family (the order of priority of the bereaved family is the spouse, child, grandchild, father, mother, grandfather, and grandmother of the person).</p>
<p>㊄ Exceptions to Compensation Provisions: The court shall not grant compensation to those who have received a verdict of innocence or acquittal and have one of the following circumstances: (1) crimes committed before the age of fourteen, or those who have one of the conditions of mental disorder, weakness, or deaf-muteness; (2) those who were prosecuted, detained, or caused the reason for requesting a retrial due to their own intentional or gross negligence; (3) the act being prosecuted clearly violates public order and good morals.</p>
<p>In addition, in the case of a trial for multiple offenses, even if one part is due to innocence or acquittal and the other part is declared guilty, the court may not award compensation.</p>
<p>㊅ Statute of Limitations for Claims for Compensation: The right to claim compensation for wrongful imprisonment must be exercised within 60 days after the judgment of innocence or acquittal is final.</p>
<p>The above six points are the important contents stipulated in the Japanese Criminal Compensation Law, which can give a glimpse of the system. However, in modern times, the countries that have taken the lead all attach importance to the people's right to survival. Whether the state has the right to punish the people depends on whether the people's behavior violates the law. At this stage of national policy gradually trending towards the rule of law, the behavior of the state and the people are equally restricted by law. Therefore, the compensation for wrongful imprisonment is not only a matter of legal responsibility but can also be regarded as a matter of legal policy. The formulation of legal content is related to national policy. Our country is still in its infancy in the legislation regarding compensation for wrongful imprisonment. The standard should be to adapt to national policy and social reality. Whether to adopt a broad or narrow doctrine in the future, and whether the method of compensation is limited to monetary compensation, and whether there are appropriate remedies for donations other than money, there is a need for detailed discussion. As for (1) whether the amount of compensation should be differentiated according to the status and economy of the person wronged, or whether there should be a general provision, freely decided by the court, (2) the statute of limitations for exercising the right to claim compensation, (3) whether to establish a separate court for wrongful imprisonment, this really depends on the deep consideration and foresight of the legislative officials. We cannot help but offer our heartfelt wishes.</p>
<h3>Retrospect and Prospect of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement</h3>
<p>— Yu Chengxiu</p>
<p>The Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement in our country originated in the 20th year of the Republic of China. At that time, the National Lawyers Association held its Third Congress in Hangzhou and suggested that the government should be responsible for compensation for erroneous judgments. In June of the 22nd year, the Fifth Congress was held in Qingdao, and the government was requested to promulgate the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Act. In September of the following year, the Sixth Congress was held in Guangzhou, and it was resolved to organize a Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee to take charge of the matter until now, which has been six years.</p>
<p>During these six years, people in the legal profession, under the instigation of the Association, have devoted their efforts and called for the establishment of a wrongful imprisonment compensation system. Thanks to the sympathetic support of people in the public opinion circle, and the judicial authorities have also expressed that they will not disregard the matter due to the difficulty of judicial funding. Therefore, the draft constitution announced on May 5, 25th year, has a special article on the national compensation system, and the National Judicial Conference has already resolved to send it to the Legislative Yuan by the Judicial Yuan. This year's campaign has also received the news that a preliminary draft has been completed. All these points, on the one hand, show the central government's emphasis on the rule of law and concern for people's suffering, and on the other hand, it is not the only result of six years of efforts.</p>
<p>Readers should already be familiar with the theory of the wrongful imprisonment compensation system, and there is no need for us to waste words. However, people in the world inevitably have some criticisms of the establishment and implementation of this system. I dare to offer my sincerity and express my humble opinion:</p>
<p>Those who criticize the wrongful imprisonment compensation system now can be summarized into three points: Some believe that the implementation of the wrongful imprisonment compensation system is sufficient to prove the large number of wrongful imprisonments, which not only damages the dignity of the rule of law but also hinders the recovery of legal rights. Some believe that the wrongful imprisonment compensation requires a fixed amount of funding, and there is more than one aspect of judicial work that urgently needs construction, so it is impossible to plan for both. Some believe that after the implementation of the wrongful imprisonment compensation system, in order to avoid the responsibility of compensation, it will be impossible to redress wrongful imprisonments, which is not worth the loss. All these three points, on the surface, do have one-sided reasons, but in reality, they lack a basis for argument.</p>
<p>The wrongful imprisonment compensation system is indeed a post-event remedy, but after the establishment of this system, judicial officials, aware of the seriousness of their responsibilities, will be more cautious in judging cases, and higher-level officials will also be more strict in selecting and supervising. Indirectly, it is not insufficient to achieve the effect of prevention. Seeing that punishment is always for crimes, what is there to say about the trouble of numerous wrongful imprisonments? The need for wrongful imprisonment compensation does not start with us. Advanced countries of the rule of law, such as England and the United States, have repeatedly seen it in precedents, and France and Japan have clearly stipulated it in their codes. If others use this as an excuse, we may as well ask them to reflect on themselves and not be overly concerned.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of Jing Zan, our wise judicial authorities have already expressed this, and it cannot be used as a criticism. In terms of the current state of the judiciary in our country, the widespread establishment of courts and the reconstruction of prisons, although all require funding, matters have priorities, and it is necessary to weigh the urgency. The widespread establishment of courts is for the convenience of the people, but before the courts are upgraded, there should be judicial organs. The reconstruction of prisons is to benefit prisoners, but before the reconstruction, there are still places for reform. Only the wrongful imprisonment compensation system, if it is not implemented for a day, the innocent and wrongly accused good people will not be consoled for a day, which is sufficient to reduce the belief in the rule of law. Its importance is greater than the widespread establishment of courts and the reconstruction of prisons. Moreover, the widespread establishment of courts and the reconstruction of prisons cannot be achieved overnight. The reconstruction of a new prison in Jiangxi requires more than 280,000 yuan, and the reconstruction of a new prison in Fujian also requires 250,000 yuan. Taking this as an example, it is feared that it will not be completed in the short term. In that case, the implementation of the wrongful imprisonment compensation movement will be distant and hopeless, how can we console the eager expectations of the people of the country?</p>
<p>Moreover, the wrongful imprisonment compensation system is the state's responsibility to the people, and the judges are responsible to the state. If the innocent are wrongly accused, not only should the state fulfill its obligation to compensate the people, but the judges must also bear the responsibility of compensation to the state. Therefore, the higher-level review will not avoid the responsibility of compensation and protect the lower-level review. Moreover, there are established rules for the assessment of case handling, and judges are well-trained and will never abandon the law for personal gain and incur the blame of dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>Based on this, the wrongful imprisonment compensation system cannot be criticized for the reasons mentioned above, and judging from the recent situation, it cannot be hindered by the criticisms in the discussion. It is important to know that after the wrongful imprisonment is constituted, the innocent good people are physically free and are unjustly bound. The original compensation is not money, and monetary compensation is the lowest requirement, which must be strongly promoted!</p>
<p>Now that the preliminary draft has been completed, the promulgation and implementation are still pending. We should continue to work hard with the spirit of the past, seek to move forward step by step, and see the implementation soon. I am willing to encourage it with the people of the country!</p>
<h3>From Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation to Legal Unity</h3>
<p>— Li Aokui</p>
<p>The wrongful imprisonment compensation movement advocated by the national legal profession, since the third congress of the Lawyers Association passed it in the 20th year of the Republic of China, has immediately attracted the attention of the broad masses, because the establishment of the wrongful imprisonment compensation system not only gives those who have suffered unjust accusations and have been vindicated, infinite comfort in spirit and material, so that the wounds stabbed in their hearts are healed, but from a positive perspective, for officials in charge of penal power, when hearing cases, they can calmly seek the truth of the facts, and not distort the legal provisions, perfunctory procedures, or even refine and complete the process, creating unwarranted wrongful imprisonments. Therefore, the true spirit of the wrongful imprisonment compensation system is definitely not hoping that the wrongfully imprisoned person can get compensation, but hoping for the reduction of wrongful imprisonments. The ancient book says: "Punishment aims at no punishment." Its explanation is that the state formulates punishments, not to make people commit crimes, its greatest purpose is to make people not commit crimes. If the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law can be formulated and implemented, then the officials in charge of penal power will feel that their responsibilities are heavy and make fair and appropriate judgments. Therefore, the establishment of this system, in the freedom that the people should enjoy, has more than one guarantee, and at the same time, the future of China's judiciary can also be more bright, which is undoubtedly certain.</p>
<p>Now, let's just talk about the facts: if the people are unfortunately involved in the law, and the facts of the crime are based on solid evidence, then they should of course be sentenced to criminal punishment. Conversely, if the person originally had no evidence of crime, and the officials in charge of penal power intentionally or negligently placed them in prison and deprived them of their freedom, then the losses suffered by the people in spirit and material cannot be estimated, and the result of the wrongful imprisonment often leads to other tragedies. Therefore, the purpose of wrongful imprisonment compensation, directly, is of course to ensure that wrongful imprisonments never happen, and indirectly, it is to raise the spirit of the rule of law. This system has already been implemented in European and American countries, and Japan has also long ago stipulated it.</p>
<p>China's judicial system cannot be said to have made considerable progress in recent years, but the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law has been continuously demanded by the national legal profession for several years. The Judicial Yuan convened a National Judicial Conference in the 24th year of the Republic of China, although it passed the wrongful imprisonment compensation system, after two years, it has not yet been made into law by the Legislative Yuan. In today's highest call for the abolition of consular jurisdiction in China by various countries, we believe that the making of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law is really urgent, why? The existence of consular jurisdiction, various countries take the excuse that China's judicial system has not been improved. If the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law is promulgated, will the officials in charge of penal power be more careful and cautious in judging cases? Then, the spirit of China's rule of law will be fully expressed, and various countries will have no way to prevaricate.</p>
<p>Based on the above two points, the implementation of the wrongful imprisonment compensation system has obvious significance both internally and externally, especially in the current rapid progress of the legal unity movement, it should be promoted to be realized!</p>
<h3>Today's Anniversary General Assembly Order</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association's Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement is scheduled to hold the anniversary general assembly of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement today (Sunday) at the Pudong Tongxiang Association's Pudong Building on the sixth floor of Fuxu Road. In addition to inviting various party, government, military, legal, agricultural, industrial, commercial, and academic institutions and groups in this city to send representatives to participate at that time, the various preparatory committees will also be divided into groups to prepare requests for major newspapers to increase special publications, and to send members to various radio stations to give speeches, and to add lantern slides in cinemas for publicity work, in order to promote the government to promulgate the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law as soon as possible, to save the people who are suffering from injustice in general. Here is a summary of the association's planned meeting order: (1) Ringing the bell to open the meeting, (2) The presidium takes its place, (3) All stand at attention and salute the party, national flag, and the portrait of the Prime Minister, (4) Respectfully reading the Prime Minister's will, (5) Silence, (6) The presidium reports on the situation of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement, (7) Representatives of various institutions and groups give speeches, (8) Matters for discussion: (A) Whether to continue to elect representatives to go to Beijing to petition in order to promote the early promulgation of the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Law, (B) Temporary motions.

Yesterday, there was a long-distance call to Shanghai, deciding to return to Shanghai by the night train at 1:00 PM today to participate in the meeting.</p>
<h3>Song of Wrongful Imprisonment</h3>
<p>— Huang Linruo</p>
<p>Why does the state legislate? To distinguish right from wrong. If there is no crime, one should not be implicated, if there is a crime, legal clauses should be drafted impartially. Minor crimes entail detention or fines, fixed-term imprisonment entails deprivation of public rights. Serious crimes are heinous and wicked, entailing life imprisonment or death. We are all compatriots, can we dare to say that we treat some kindly and others unkindly? Criminals should be subject to standard punishments. Adding punishment to people, how can it be done? "Punishment aims at no punishment," the ancients said. A reverent heart for punishment is the mark of a gentleman. Judicial independence is a heavy responsibility. How can one arbitrarily determine guilt or innocence? If one can get to the heart of a case, it is worthy of pity and sympathy, not joy. If one relies on the power in one's hands, and relies entirely on one's own psychology, then there will always be excuses to add guilt, and suspicious crimes will be judged with severity. A family of integrity and good people is despised when imprisoned. Judges seem to have great power, with a bald pen and a piece of paper. If there is a slight prejudice or carelessness, it will cause a person to suffer shame for life. Time is wasted under iron bars, and parents, wives, and children call out in distress. Relatives and friends rush around, gold is spent, and the family is ruined. Unjust grievances are slowly redressed, and who will compensate for the infinite losses? It is said that there is a time to examine the past. Shun was the emperor and Gao Yao was his official. Wanting to eliminate violence and bring peace, the use of exemplary punishments began from this. The Zhou official Sikou listened to five sounds, handled prisons with care, and followed the right path. In the Western Han dynasty, cruel officials like Zhao Zhang and the city was full of people in prison clothes. Deep injustice was not blamed, and literary tricks defiled honest officials. One must have a heart of compassion when enforcing the law and not cause the people to look askance. One must seek fairness in governing prisons and not allow Yu Gong to monopolize the praise. The three words "perhaps so" leave behind a hatred. From ancient times, wrongful imprisonments have been like this. If we want wrongful imprisonments to have a price, we must stipulate compensation. It concerns the people's livelihood and rights, and your movement has grasped its purpose.</p>
<h3>A Visit to Ward Road Jail (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent</p>
<p>San Francisco's Alcatraz prison is often described in newspapers as being as solid as an iron bucket, with no escapes ever occurring. Shanghai's new Ward Road Jail even has more enviable achievements. Not only have none of its prisoners escaped, but they have never even entertained the thought of trying to regain their freedom. This prison can accommodate over six thousand prisoners, making it arguably the largest in the world. We had long heard of this prison's reputation and were, of course, eager to visit it. Upon arriving there, we passed through the first and second gates with relative ease. However, before the second gate, a guard peered out from inside an iron grille before opening the gate to let us in. The guard then led us to a small office, where we waited for several minutes as a Russian guard took our calling cards to Captain Wauchope, the warden. Soon, he returned to the office and beckoned us to follow him. We passed through another gate into the prison courtyard, which was guarded by more than a dozen Chinese and Indian constables.</p>
<p>Captain Wauchope received us in his office. We asked him many questions, which he patiently answered one by one. Later, he suggested that the best way to understand the prison's organization was to tour its various departments. Therefore, we were led by Vice Warden Grant, the longest-serving staff member of the prison. He suggested we follow the order in which convicts enter the prison after disembarking from the prison van. So, we first arrived at the key room. All the prison's keys are managed by a Western head guard. Whenever an officer needs to retrieve a key, they must first sign a register. The guard used the key to open the door and we entered the first interrogation room. Upon arrival, the convict's original name is cancelled and he is given a number according to the register. From the day he enters prison to the day he is released, he is no longer referred to as Zhang San or Li Si, but simply as prisoner number so-and-so. In this room, the convict is searched and, after verifying his card, he is given a small round copper tag with his number on it. Then, he enters the second room, where he strips off his clothes on a straw mat for fumigation and disinfection. The clothes are not worn in prison and are returned to him when he is released and regains his freedom. After showering and shaving his head and beard, the prison doctor examines his body. If he has any illnesses, he must first be sent to the prison hospital for treatment. After recovering, he goes to the clothing room to receive a set of two-toned cloth prison garb. The colors of the clothing are differentiated according to the length of the sentence. Black and white clothing with a yellow tag on the left chest is for prisoners sentenced to ten to fifteen years. Blue and black clothing is for prisoners serving life sentences. There are many such distinctions, too numerous to mention. Therefore, the prison authorities can tell at a glance whether a prisoner has committed a minor or serious crime. After the prisoner puts on his new clothes, he is taken to a training room, where a supervisor loudly reads the rules to him and informs him that he must abide by them in all matters to avoid punishment. After training, the prisoner enters his cell. The entire prison has eight buildings, each with four hundred and sixty cells. Underage prisoners are separately confined in the juvenile section.</p>
<p>For the first few months of imprisonment, apart from two daily outdoor exercise sessions, the prisoner must be confined to a very small cell. After a few months, if his behavior is good, he has the opportunity to work in the prison workshop. There, he can have companions and earn some money, but no matter how long his imprisonment, the amount of money he earns is limited to a maximum of ten yuan. Because the number of prisoners in the prison is very large, another building is set up specifically for cooking. Over twenty thousand meals must be prepared every day. The food is cooked in large pots using steam and then divided into tin cans and sent to each prisoner. To prevent the spread of disease, each tin can is boiled in boiling water before meals. The daily meals consist of rice and salted beans, mixed with unhulled rice to prevent beriberi. Several days a month, meat is served, such as beef, pork, or salted fish. The large kitchen has dozens of cooks and helpers, all of whom are prisoners. Distributing food to thousands of prisoners is not an easy task. Therefore, a narrow-gauge railway was built in the prison. As soon as the food is cooked, it is transported on the railway to various parts of the prison, which is naturally much faster than delivering it by hand, thus solving this troublesome problem. When we passed through the printing department, we looked inside and saw a prisoner busy writing reports for the Criminal Department of the Public Works Department. Because he was literate, he was assigned to this task. According to the guide, many of the documents used by the Public Works Department are printed here. The colorful printed notices posted on the streets, urging people to get vaccinated, to be careful when walking, and to maintain hygiene in the summer, are all produced by prisoners. There are even artists among the prisoners who are responsible for drawing and making samples. The printing department is fully equipped and can be compared to outside printing houses.</p>
<p>There is also a shoe department, where the leather shoes worn by the Russian contingent and the Chinese and Indian constables are made. They are also repaired there every year. The slippers worn by the prisoners are also made by themselves, using old tires for the soles, which makes it difficult to escape. The prison uniforms worn by the prisoners are made in the clothing department. After the clothing for the constables is cut by tailors, it is also sent to the prison's clothing department for sewing. Other products made in the prison include tennis nets, mats, paintbrushes, sheet metal utensils, woodenware, rattanware, and dozens of other items. The carved woodenware is made by skilled craftsmen and sold all over the world. The buyers would never imagine that they are products made by prisoners. Most of the items used by the various departments of the Public Works Department and the prison are made by prisoners. However, most of the items made by prisoners are custom-made, and the annual profits are considerable.</p>
<h3>Teacher Qualifications</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ge</p>
<p>We can call this world we live in, the "World of Qualifications". Why is this the case? It is because if you don't have "qualifications," then don't even think about "eating." If you want to apply to a company or organization, you must first ask yourself, "Do I have the qualifications?" That is, do you have a high school diploma? (Of course, a university degree is even better.) If not, then you'd better be sensible and not waste money on photographs, travel expenses, etc., and just accept your hunger in peace.</p>
<p>However, if society requires everyone to have qualifications, then society must provide everyone with qualifications! But no! Poor kids with no money still can't get into high school, and they shouldn't even dream of going to university! However, even if you graduate from high school or university and have a "certificate to eat," i.e., a diploma, you're still helpless in this era of "graduation equals unemployment." This society is made up of qualified people struggling to earn a living, so what about those without qualifications? Isn't that tragic?</p>
<p>A while ago, (and this is still the case now, but the problem is much more serious,) if you had the "higher elementary school" qualification, you could, when you were desperate, go to the "lane schools" and find a place to stay for a while, sheltering from the storm and filling your stomach. Someone jokingly calls this road "the last resort of heroes," of course, waiting for the times to get better so they can leap over the dragon gate and make a comeback! However, the crisis of primary school education is hidden in this, and it can be imagined and seen.</p>
<p>Now some people are advocating the "good teachers build the nation" movement, which is certainly a good movement, because if China doesn't "prosper" at the moment, it will "perish." There are certainly many ways to build the nation, but "good teachers building the nation" seems to be particularly important. Because good teachers not only have a great influence on the future masters of our country, but also have a very important meaning for society. Therefore, the problem of "teacher qualifications" comes with this, the so-called "teacher qualifications," that is, the "qualifications" for being a teacher. If the teacher is good, the country can prosper.</p>
<p>Continued on page three.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>So, good teachers certainly need to have qualifications. I said earlier: "This is still the case now, but the problem is much more serious." This refers to the fact that even being a teacher requires qualifications.</p>
<p>"Everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world," this is a commonplace saying. Good teachers building the nation, under the meaning of this sentence, will certainly not be a problem, the problem is whether that teacher is standing on the "building the nation" position to educate children and influence society. And the education authorities do not necessarily have to demand whether their "qualifications" are teacher-training graduates, because this will unnecessarily add a large number of "unemployed soldiers," so the remedy is to give teachers a necessary "advanced study" subject. Mr. Chen Heqin, in the special issue of the June 6th Teachers' Day, "How to Practice Our Creed," clauses 24 to 26, says: "Participate in educational societies with research properties; Read newspapers and books for at least one hour a day; Experimentally study various subjects of teaching," if this is really done, I believe that on the one hand, the absurd idea of teachers regarding primary schools as "refuges" will be corrected, and at the same time, not only will it not unnecessarily add a large number of "unemployed soldiers," but good teachers will obviously have an effect in the practical sense. I hope this is the substantive meaning of "teacher qualifications."</p>
