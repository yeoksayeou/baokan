<h3>敵軍準備四次總攻日內又將展開主力戰</h3>
<p>我士氣奮發工事堅固誓予痛擊　我砲轟市中心區虹口敵受重創　昨日廣東路敵軍進犯被我擊潰</p>
<p>敵軍第四次援乓陸續開到從、近二三日來不時以大砲猛攻、並由飛機策應轟炸、似為準備第四次總攻之試探、同時各路均有激烈接觸、大致日內又將展開主力戰爭、昨日情況、除雙方砲戰外、仍各維持原來陣地、我軍堅守永安橋、以控制楊行方面之敵、羅店西北敵軍一度猛烈進犯、被我擊退後、昨日敵已不敢再犯、雙方在張家堰附近一小河隔岸對峙中、敵在該方面積極增援、配備砲位、企圖破我防綫、襲我後路、但我大軍雲集、防禦森嚴、敵如來犯、必予以迎頭痛擊、江灣至閘北之綫、昨僅有小部隊之遭遇戰、進犯敵軍、均被我奮勇擊退、虬江路廣東路昨日下午曾有一小中隊之敵、向我寶山路衝鋒、經我密集機槍手溜彌等火力掃射、狠狽敗回、迄夜敵未再犯、浦東方面、情形如昔、敵軍雖聲言將於日內再圖總攻、觀察近數日來之形勢、除利用大砲及飛機投彈外、未必再有其他之積極行動、蓋敵方步兵畏縮無能、一遇白刃肉搏、卽抱頭鼠竄、據前綫指揮長官談、我軍工事堅固、軍心奮發、敵軍企圖在羅店至劉行及羅店至瀏河間之中路哭破計劃、决難得逞、我且抱定持久作戰乏誓言、必予瘋狂軍閥以嚴實打擊、而殲滅其實力云、</p>
<p>昨下午四時後、敵以屢次進犯未逞、敵炮開始向我閘北方面不斷轟擊、我方工車、並無損失、徒費彈藥至五時許、其市中心區砲兵、又向我體育會路一帶陣地猛轟、我方砲兵、亦向泗涇球塲市運動塲敵軍陣地還擊、砲聲隆隆、全市震驚至傍晚九時、我又以重砲向虹口方面猛轟、目標為敵新移之司令部及軍械庫、標的準確、敵捐失甚重、深夜砲聲未停、</p>
<h3>羅店之敵準備第四次總攻</h3>
<p>前昨猛力進犯試探我軍實力　我軍衝鋒肉搏獲戰利品甚多　今明日將有大戰我準備痛擊</p>
<p>羅店方面之敵軍懾伏兩日後、前晚起、又趨活動、昨晨敵以雄厚之兵力、向我警戒綫進犯、但經我軍奮勇抵抗、敵卽引退、似係試探我軍實力、準備作第四次總攻者、刻該處敵軍調動軍隊配置砲位、甚為忙碌、其砲火射程、可達施相公廟、該處位於羅店嘉定公路旁、在羅店之西約二千公尺、我在該處、已嚴密警戒、敵如來犯、當卽迎頭痛擊、預料今明日內、大戰又將屢開云、</p>
<p>敵屢犯我羅店方面陣地、我軍沉着應戰、敵終不逞、前日（二十七日）敵復以大砲向我轟擊、雖共火力十分猛烈、但發射毫無標的、故我方在軍事上絕未受損、我軍安伏壕中、不予還擊、敵步兵一小隊、以為有機可乘、即貿然衝入我警戒綫內、我俟其逼近、先以機槍掃射後、並紛紛躍出衝擊、遂發生極猛烈之肉搏戰、敵傷亡極重、不支而退、並遺秦地圖旗幟重要文件及共他戰利品甚多、均為我軍所獲、在敵軍文伴中、又發現敵軍作戰計書及各種詭謀甚詳云、</p>
<p>施相公廟以東逼近羅店鎮我軍、前晚昨晨、血戰終夜、我軍大捷、殲敵二百餘名、並羲獲戰利品及文件無數、</p>
<p>羅店至瀏河口方面、日來為敵方進攻之主要目標、該處敵我陣綫、現在羅店之西北張家堰方面一小河對峙之中、我在該處工事鞏固異常、確可堅守、敵如進攻、决難得逞云、</p>
<h3>江灣閘北砲戰激烈</h3>
<p>中央社記者昨晨赴××軍次、訪晤孫帥長、卽詢近日閘北及江灣一帶戰祝、據稱江灣方面、自二十五日起、敵軍忽又蠢動、致雙方發生激烈砲戰、敵軍火砲每小時竟發至一二千發之多、惟均漫無標的、至飛機投彈、亦等虛擲、是以我軍陣地、毫未損毀、反之、我軍亦以重砲還擊、則屢中敵軍要害、予以重創、至雙方發生前哨戰時、敵軍鬥志更弱、一經迎擊、卽行潰退、我軍每於追擊後仍退返原防、故雙方陳綫、現亦無甚變化、至於閘北方面、戰事則遠不若江灣方面之激烈、敵軍每小時發砲約數百發、昨日砲戰竟日、敵軍並以飛機助戰投彈十餘枚、結果我軍僅死士兵一人而已、敵軍如此消耗浪費、固為我軍所歡迎、現兩軍陣地、相距甚近、我軍工事、極為堅强、敵軍迄未敢以步兵進犯、總之、敵軍如欲越雷池一步、絕不可能云、</p>
<h3>跑馬廳發生前哨戰</h3>
<p>中央社云、昨晚八時起、市中心區之敵、沿三民路西進、卽在江灣跑馬廳之北李家宅北季宅東宅等處、興我前哨發生接觸、敵知我戒備森嚴、未敢深入、近日來敵擬佔據江灣跑馬廳開為機場、故屢次進犯、冀圖壓迫我前哨後退、惟截至昨夜止、敵此項企圖、未能實現、該跑馬廳為我警戒錢、敵我前哨甚為接近、</p>
<h3>敵犯寶山路被擊潰</h3>
<p>相持二小時斃敵廿餘人</p>
<p>昨午二時餘、敵海軍陸戰隊一中隊、由虬江路廣東街、向我實山路進犯、同時敵艦不斷砲擊、而敵機十餘架分為數小隊亦在該處上空來回偵察　並低飛投擲炸彈兼用機關槍掃射、我軍憑鞏固之防禦工事、沉着應戰、相持約二小時、斃敵廿餘人、卒將其擊退、我亦死一傷二、當時傅有敵機一架、被我高射砲擊中墮毀、惟我軍發言人未能予以證實云、</p>
<p>前晚（廿七日）起、敵在江膚方面分三路進犯我持志大學陣地、我軍沉着應付、激戰終夜、至昨晨零時卅分、經將敵陣散、始不支而退、我卽派機關槍隊由新市路追踪出擊、猛攻江灣路愛國女學　敵軍陣地東首、密集掃射、擊敵甚多、敵勢不支、卽行後退、我亦不深進、至昨晨三時、槍聲漸稀、僅有前哨之小接觸、</p>
<h3>我堅守永安橋一帶</h3>
<p>工事堅固敵卒難再犯</p>
<p>劉行之線　自我軍收復永安橋後　乘勝挺進、潰退敵軍、狠狽不堪、我軍收復各重要村落後、將敵軍所遺工事、趕緊修築、前晨拂曉、潰退之敵、捲土重來、對我永安橋一帶陣地、作猛烈之反攻、砲火掩護之外、敵機及坦克車、亦同時活動　我軍乘新勝餘威奮勇迎戰、猛向敵軍撲擊、我方砲隊、亦向敵還擊、自晨至晚、激戰頗烈、入晚敵勢漸現不支、紛向後退、激戰稍患、午夜又有敵軍一股、企圖進犯、我軍早已準備、前晨已將敵擊退、現我軍堅守永安橋一帶陣地、異常堅固、敵軍决難再犯、</p>
<p>中央社云、劉行方面、我軍收復金家灣永安橋一帶陣地後、仍乘勝奮勇追趕敵踪、迫近楊行一帶敵軍陣地、我軍穩打穩紮、卽在該處佈置警戒錢、前晨（二十七日）敵得後援部隊復向我進犯、我軍奮勇迎擊、雙方激戰甚烈、我現仍固守永安橋一帶陣地、敵已無力反攻、</p>
<p>楊行方面之敵、因連日前綫失利、受創頗巨、士卒銳氣已銷、故該錢屨受我軍之壓暹、退入保安鄉地帶、我軍乘勝沿寶劉公路向前挺進、前鋒已抵朱家油車·福壽庵·小廟村·陸家堰等處、昨晨拂曉、敵軍又來犯我朱家油車陣地、雙方遂發生激戰、但半小時後、漸疏漸密、相持至午、敵見無進窺之可能、遂向後退、我軍扼守永安橋、而以朱家油車福壽廟等處為前哨防地、該處距楊行鍞、約三華里左右、</p>
<h3>敵軍進犯頭家鎭經我軍奮勇擊退</h3>
<p>兩軍鏖戰建十二小時　楊九房敵軍構築工事</p>
<p>中央社蘇州七日電、頃據前方確訊、劉行方面、敵軍數百人、廿七日晨四時起、以坦克車九輛掩護、向我劉行西南之顧家鎮進攻、並有敵機數架、在我陣地上空肆行轟炸、我軍當卽奮勇抗戰、有進無退、此次戰事、自拂曉四時開始、至下午四時停止、兩軍鏖戰達十二小時之久、敵卒不支退却、敵坦克車亦被我小鋼砲擊退、我軍未止追擊、仍嚴守陳綫、雙方現對峙中、同時敵軍三四百人、在楊九房構筑工事、防我進攻、</p>
<h3>賀家巷殲敵三百餘</h3>
<p>前晚（廿七日）十一時、賀家巷我軍向泗涇球塲敵軍陣地攻入、又以口團之衆、抄出東宅、截斷翔股路敵軍後路、於是兩路均起激烈之遭遇戰、相持至三四小時之入、我軍實力雄厚、節節前進、敵初以為我軍此綫防務、不及閘北一錢之鞏固、故迭攻持志大學失敗後、卽向此方面活動、經此一場激戰、敵三百餘人、毀敵戰車一輛、奪獲步檢多支、敵知不逞、卽向市中心區方面退去、</p>
<p>昨晚我軍啃兵、會潛入市中心區敵軍陣地內、刺探敵方軍情、據返報、敵在該區四週、搆築工事、似防我軍之反攻而圖在該處長久槃踞云、</p>
<h3>浦江敵艇分頭騷擾</h3>
<p>前晚八時許、虹口浦面敵艦、又向浦東我軍陣地開砲挑釁、我砲兵陣地亦以重砲還擊、時隆隆之聲、震動遐邇、至九時光景、敵方果乘砲戰猛烈之際、派出汽艇三艘、潢載兵士約六十名、出現於浦東秦同碼頭、用機槍向岸北掃射、我機槍隊奮力抵禦、彈如爾下、敵艇見有準備、旋又駛向上游南洋碼頭墳山碼頭春江碼頭三口岸、再度衝襲、均遭我用機槍强力掃射、敵艇卽告收退、遂折至墳山碼頭北面英商祥生鐵廠碼頭、敵兵約五十名、不動聲色、爬行登岸、詎敵乓膽小如鼠、鬼鬼祟祟、在該廠逗留十餘分鐘、深恐中我伏兵、旋卽逃至浦灘下艇疾駛逸去、至深晚十一時、敵我雙方猛烈之砲戰又起、忽爾敵艇增至四艘、又向春江碼頭浦面散開、全圖偷襲登陸、雙方互用機槍交戰、我機檢手技術高强、從容不迫、予以迎頭痛擊、敵兵雖藉鋼板掩護、仍有中彈傷亡、鏖戰約二三十分鐘　敵艇又告不支、分投疾駛逸去、敵軍經此兩度慘敗、掩旗息鼓、故作農甚為沉寂云、</p>
<h3>敵機昨日四出轟炸</h3>
<p>昨晨七時、敵水上飛機一架、自出雲旗艦上突然起飛、至浦東隆茂棧後面投一彈後、當卽飛返原艦、其來去匆匆、狀至恐慌、敵空軍之實力、可見一斑、</p>
<p>昨日上午、浦東方面、敵機九架低空窺察甚久、並投炸彈二枚、同時停泊於浦中之敵艦、向我浦東方面發砲數十發、我方亦卽予以還擊、另有敵機四架、則在滬南方面低飛甚久、又至龍華機場投彈四枚、</p>
<p>昨晨九時半後，敵機三架、在閘北我陣地高空槃旋、我方以高射砲及高射機關撿射擊、敵機不敢低飛、但仍亂投巨彈十餘枚、我平民三人被難、至中午、敵機二架、又在閘北天空投憚、我方損失極微、</p>
<p>昨日上午八時許起至十一時止、敵飛機又在閘北不斷投擲重大炸彈、多數落於北火車站寶山路以北一帶、下午一時後、市中心方面之敵、又以重砲向我猛轟、我亦發砲回擊、其聲較敵砲尤猛、我之砲彈、均落在北四川路東老靶子路以北、卽狄思戚路三角小菜場一段敵軍區內、而敵彈則多數落在中興路北共和新路以西荒地、二時左右又來敵飛機四架、分作兩隊、先後在寶山路·中興路·大統路·蘇州河上空槃旋、機卽各擲重彈多枚、亦落賓山路虬江路北面、後被我軍用高射砲高射機關槍擊退、似有數架着彈受創、</p>
<p>昨日下午五時五十分、敵機一架、至閔行上空盤繞數週後、機在鎮東約五六里之吳家渡附近、擲下一彈、當場爆炸、時有三五鄉民、正在張網捕魚、致有一人破擊受傷、今晨八時半、敵重矗炸機二架、在龍華飛機塲低飛偵察、並擲彈四枚、一落中國航空公司房屋、二落歐亞公司大門附近、均爆炸、一人浦江、</p>
<h3>嘉定紗廠被敵炸燬</h3>
<p>昨據嘉定來人談、二十七日下午四時許、有敵機十一架、飛至嘉定上空、擲彈轟炸、尤以西門外之侯黃候一帶為最烈、附近之嘉豐紗廠、竟被投中重磅炸彈四枚、燬壞頗巨、查該廠為嘉定唯一之紗廠、足見敵人摧毀我國實業之用心、</p>
<h3>日潛艇擊沉我漁船</h3>
<p>關於日本潛水艇、在香港附近海面、擊沉中國漁船事、據二十七日路透電載稱、中國漁船十二艘、於九月二十二日、在某朗鈎角（譯音）外捕魚時候、遭日本潛水艇一艘轟擊、僅漁船一艘脫逃、漁夫三百餘人、均遭溺斃、僅有十人、值德國船商賀斯特號經過乃運載至香港登陸、關於此事、昨日同盟社加以否認、但其上午所發之稿、謂商賀斯特號、當日並未駛經香港附近海面云、下午該社發稿、取消上午所發之稿、而另行發稿、謂當時在厦門附近、及在九龍出口處、並無日本潛水艇、·可見其意圖狡賴、前後矛盾、欲蓋彌彰、</p>
<h3>我軍事發言人厭詞駁斥敵方造謠</h3>
<p>訂購軍火絕非行政機關權限之事　世界上具大量達姆彈者祇有日本　虛搆謠言顯係另有作用</p>
<p>中央社云、據同盟社所發日外務省發言人稱、賞日軍佔據滬市中心區時、會搜獲華方向某國購買達姆彈四千五百萬發之合同、同時亦曾擭獲巨量該類子彈之情息、我軍事機關發言人對上述消息、加以駁斥云、關於訂購軍火、絕非行政機關權限之事、質言之、市府决無向外國訂購軍火之權、且達姆彈為國際公怯所不許之殘殺工具、我方絕無此物、日本變言人亦未指明某國為何國、吾人根據過去作戰之經驗、深知世界上具有如此大量之殘殺工眞者、祇有一國、卽日本是也、是以日方此種虛構之謠言、顯係另有作用、又如敵方在招待外報記者席上、屢次誣指我方使用噴嚏彈一事、事出一貫、不值一駁，據吾人推測、實由於敵軍在滬作戰、付下極大之代價、蒙受極大之損失、而仍一籌莫展、故出此造謠中傷之下策、藉以俺護其自身將運用毒氣或其他達反國際公法之慘毒行為云、</p>
<h3>日機轟炸平民破壞國際公法</h3>
<p>外籍公法學家精湛議論　痛駁敵軍本田武官謬說</p>
<p>大陸報云、日大使署海軍武官本田海軍少將、星期日曾發表日飛機轟炸非戰鬥員為國際公怯所許之言論、大陸報代表昨日曾訪日本埠外籍公法學家數人、徵求意見、據謂一九二三年華盛頓舉行軍縮會議復、海牙召集夫空委員會、通過若干决議案、但從未經與會各國政府批准、日本亦在其內、·本田所發日飛機理得轟炸平成所援引之原則、並未經各國承認、故未編入國際公法云、木埠觀察家皆以為本田之發此言、必曾諮詢日第三艦隊法律顧問藤武敎授、而徵其意見、該敎授在一二八滬戰中、亦任此職、一九三二年、著有“滬戰之國際公法”一書、今可引其書中之言、以攻本田之謬論、蓋其書中有“一九二二年至二三年”代表六國之公怯顧問委員會、在海牙草擬大空戰爭法規、及戰時無綫電管理規則、惟並未列人任何國際公約”等語也、外籍公法學家又稱、彼二人探討海牙法規、以證明日飛機暴行之正常、均已忘却所提議法規中至肯定之條款、或有意置之不顧、二者必居其一也、日政府如信海牙法規業已實行、而發生效力、則彼雖未予承認、而下列事實、實興轟炸非戰鬥員問題甚有關係也、海牙法規第二十二條日、“志在威嚇平民、或摧毀非軍事性質的私人產業、或傷害非戰鬥員之天空轟炸、一律禁廾”、又第二十四條第二節日、“禁止轟擊不逼近陸地軍隊作戰區域之城鎮村莊房屋、或一切建築、如第二節開列之目的物、（軍事建設兵工廠運輸綫等）、適在其地、而轟炸有殃及平民之虞、則飛機不得加以矗炸一再、國際公法之根本原則、為非戰門員在陸海與天空、均不得加以直接轟擊、此項原則、近始列入一决議案、於一九三二年、由軍縮會總委員會通過、該决議案曰、“天空攻擊平民、應絕對禁止”、此實為重要會議第一幕商妥之决議也、</p>
<h3>受我空軍威脅敵機被炸燬多架</h3>
<p>楊樹浦路底飛機塲之敵機　每日傍晚均拖至他處停置</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>晉北捷音</h3>
<p>— 賓</p>
<p>在平綏綫戰事失利的沉悶空氣中。傳來了晉北八路軍的捷報。八路軍自奉命北上以後。卽在晉北平型關一帶攔殺南侵的日軍。二十三日首先將坂垣部屬鈴木師團大部殲滅。斃敵二千人。俘虜二千五百人。二十五日又驅軍直前。截斷靈邱到廣靈的大道阻敵去路。奪獲軍機無算。這是華北戰爭以來的第一次勝利。也就是國共宣布合作以後的第一個喜訊。全國的人民感奮極了。因爲這次的勝利不僅使平漢平綏兩綫的戰局換了樣子。同時更證明了八路軍將士忠勇衛國的赤誠。更證明了國共合作力量的偉大國共兩黨同志經了十年慘痛的敎訓今天終於在日寇殘酷的進攻之下團結殺敵了。這實在是比晉北軍事勝利還更可歡喜更可感動的事情。</p>
<p>自然。我們的抗戰是全面的持久的抗戰。一時的勝敗。一地的得失。並不足以左右我們的憂喜。不過從這次晉北的初步進展中。我們郤得到了一個深切的敎訓。那就是要保證抗戰的勝利。政治工作必須和軍事相配合。武力必須和民衆相聯絡。我們知道八路軍這次的獲勝。並不是靠了怎樣精銳的武器。也不是靠了怎樣現代化的機械部隊。這些是他們深感缺少的。八路軍的能够制勝頑敵。是完全由於軍隊靠政治工作的運用。跟民衆密切聯合的緣故。八路軍擅長的是遊擊戰術。而遊擊戰的主要條件就是民衆的支持。</p>
<p>平津的陷落是由於宋哲元的優柔寡斷。南口的失守。是由於劉汝明的庸懦無能。天鎭大同的退出。是由於李服膺的離棄職守。歸根結蒂。都是由於幾個軍人政治認識的不足。由於軍隊沒有跟民衆打成一片。民衆平時對軍隊沒有什麽好感。戰時也就不能獲得民衆的援助。因此。從上述兩個相反的例子。證明着要保證抗戰的勝利。軍事必須跟政治工作相配合。軍隊的力量必须聯絡民衆的力量。</p>
<p>從這次晉北的勝利。我們體騐到這個深切的啟示。現在。華北的主力戰已將開始。保定滄州間的陣地戰必將與晉綏冀察各處的遊擊戰同時展開。我們希望北方乃至全國忠勇的將領。除了奮身殺敵之外。也能注意政治工作纔好。</p>
<p>最後我們還得注意平型關前一戰雖然使我們西北的軍事形勢改善了不少。但這裹畢竟祇是華北的一隅。我們要求的不是局部的進展。而是全面的勝利。所以跟着八路軍的進展之後。我們還熱切地竚聽着津浦平漢各路軍事的成功。惟有各路軍隊的一致努力。纔能保證整個華北局面的好轉。</p>

<p>敵小隊偷渡失敗</p>
<p>今晨四時許、本市黃浦江內、發生巨大爆烽聲震驚全市、滬上居民、多有從夢中驚醒者、茲經本報記者探訪、乃知係由我國所發之某項爆炸物、在敵旗艦出雲附近轟然爆發、炸聲過後、出雲艦及停在中棧之一號艦、各放探海燈向浦江四週探查頗久、毫無痕蹟查見、敵艦卽開始向我浦東陣地、亂開大砲、為無目的射擊、經一小時之久、共放數百砲、一時隆隆之聲不絕、大致每一二秒鐘、發出一彈、我××駐家、亦回砲轟擊、直至七時左右、砲聲始絕、敵軍在亂放大砲時、曾派兵兩小隊、乘小舢板欲上春江碼頭、與陸家嘴南附近碼頭、其時天尚未明、我軍俟其駛近、卽以機槍掃射、敵艇以無法靠岸、仍退回各艦、陸家嘴一帶、多為外商廠棧、茲因日艦濫放大砲、無的轟射、今晨春注碼頭前各洋商廠屋頂上、已懸掛旗號、表示產業主權、籍阻日艦濫轟、</p>

<h3>敵排炮轟施相公廟</h3>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>茲有一事。至堪研究。卽敵在楊樹流區設立收稅機關是。據敵人所稱。自該機關成立後。卽向日本到滬各船。收取關稅。惟僅於商品卸岸時。查騐征稅。軍火則並不查騐云云。</p>
<p>果如所稱。設立該關。是祇限於征收敵人商品到滬關稅。但彼又稱。自戰事發生後。日船到滬者。均不載有商品。則該關所收者將何物歟？</p>
<p>又彼之組織。定名為徵收關稅臨時委員會。則又是臨時性質。而非永久性質所收者係敵人之商品稅。而非各國之商品稅。卽云臨時。則必限於戰爭時期。但戰爭時期。又早知無商品到滬。則該機關未免等於虛設。若征收關稅。而祗限於日本商品。則在滬設關更是「攀石頭壓自己腳完全毫無意義。照此看來。此中大有問題。不特關於我國主權與利益甚鉅。而各國亦恐受絕大之影響。不可不注意及之也。</p>

<h3>The Enemy Army Prepares for a Fourth General Offensive, Major Warfare to Resume Within Days</h3>
<p>Our Morale is High, Fortifications are Strong, Vowing to Deal a Heavy Blow. Our Artillery Bombards the Hongkou Area in the City Center, Inflicting Heavy Losses on the Enemy. Yesterday, Enemy Troops Advanced on Guangdong Road and were Repulsed by Us.</p>
<p>The enemy's fourth wave of reinforcements has arrived in succession. For the past two or three days, they have intermittently launched fierce artillery attacks, supported by aerial bombardment, seemingly as a probing attempt in preparation for a fourth general offensive. Simultaneously, intense engagements have occurred on all fronts. Generally, major warfare is expected to resume within days. Yesterday's situation, apart from the artillery duels between the two sides, largely maintained the original positions. Our troops firmly hold the Yong'an Bridge to control the enemy in the Yanghang area. Enemy troops launched a fierce attack northwest of Luodian but were repulsed by us. Yesterday, the enemy dared not attack again. The two sides are in a standoff across a small river near Zhangjiayan. The enemy is actively reinforcing that area and deploying artillery positions in an attempt to breach our defenses and attack our rear. However, our large army is gathered, with strong defenses. If the enemy attacks, they will undoubtedly be met with a head-on blow. On the Jiangwan to Zhabei line, there were only skirmishes with small units yesterday. Advancing enemy troops were all bravely repulsed by us. Yesterday afternoon, a small company of enemy troops on Qiujiang Road and Guangdong Road charged towards our Baoshan Road position but were forced to retreat in a disarray under the intense machine-gun fire of our troops. The enemy did not attack again until nightfall. The situation in Pudong remains the same as before. Although the enemy claims that they will launch another general offensive within days, observing the situation in recent days, apart from using artillery and aerial bombardment, they may not have any other active actions. This is because the enemy infantry is cowardly and incompetent. Once they encounter close-quarters combat, they flee in panic. According to the commander at the front lines, our fortifications are strong and the morale of our troops is high. The enemy's attempt to break through our lines in the central route between Luodian to Liuhang and Luodian to Liuhe is bound to fail. We are determined to engage in prolonged warfare and vow to inflict a severe blow on the crazy warlords and annihilate their strength.</p>
<p>After 4:00 PM yesterday, the enemy, having repeatedly failed in their attacks, began to continuously bombard our Zhabei area with artillery. Our engineering works suffered no losses, and the enemy simply wasted ammunition. Around 5:00 PM, their artillery in the city center again launched a fierce bombardment of our positions in the Tiyuhui Road area. Our artillery also retaliated, firing at the enemy positions in the Sijing Ballfield and the City Sports Field. The artillery fire roared, shaking the entire city. At 9:00 PM in the evening, we again used heavy artillery to bombard the Hongkou area, targeting the enemy's newly moved command post and armory. The targeting was accurate, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. The sound of artillery fire did not stop late into the night.</p>
<h3>The Enemy in Luodian Prepares for a Fourth General Offensive</h3>
<p>Launching Fierce Attacks Yesterday and the Day Before to Probe Our Military Strength. Our Troops Charge in Close-Quarters Combat, Gaining Many Spoils of War. Major Battle Imminent Today and Tomorrow, We are Prepared to Inflict a Heavy Blow.</p>
<p>After being subdued for two days, the enemy troops in Luodian became active again the night before last. Yesterday morning, the enemy used a large force to attack our defense line, but after our troops bravely resisted, the enemy retreated. It seems that they are probing our military strength in preparation for a fourth general offensive. Currently, the enemy troops in that area are busy mobilizing troops and deploying artillery positions. Their artillery fire range can reach Shi Xiang Gong Temple, which is located on the Luodian-Jiading Highway, about 2,000 meters west of Luodian. We have established a strict defense there. If the enemy attacks, we will immediately meet them with a head-on blow. It is expected that a major battle will break out again today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>The enemy has repeatedly attacked our positions in the Luodian area, but our troops have calmly responded, and the enemy has ultimately failed. The day before yesterday (the 27th), the enemy again bombarded us with artillery. Although their firepower was very fierce, the firing was aimless, so we suffered no military damage. Our troops lay low in the trenches, not retaliating. A small team of enemy infantry thought there was an opportunity and rashly charged into our defense line. We waited for them to get close, first sweeping them with machine guns, and then jumped out to attack, resulting in a very fierce close-quarters combat. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated, abandoning many important documents, including maps, flags, and other spoils of war, all of which were captured by our troops. In the enemy documents, we also found detailed enemy battle plans and various conspiracies.</p>
<p>East of Shi Xiang Gong Temple, our troops, close to Luodian, fought fiercely all night the night before last and yesterday morning. Our army won a great victory, annihilating more than two hundred enemies and capturing countless spoils of war and documents.</p>
<p>The Luodian to Liuhankou area has been the main target of the enemy's attacks in recent days. The front lines between us and the enemy in that area are currently in a standoff across a small river in the Zhangjiayan area northwest of Luodian. Our fortifications in that area are extraordinarily strong and can be firmly defended. If the enemy attacks, they will definitely fail.</p>
<h3>Intense Artillery Battles in Jiangwan and Zhabei</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency went to the headquarters of the ×× Army and interviewed Commander Sun. They asked about the recent battles in the Zhabei and Jiangwan areas. According to him, in the Jiangwan area, the enemy suddenly became restless again on the 25th, leading to fierce artillery battles between the two sides. The enemy's artillery fired as many as one or two thousand rounds per hour, but all were aimless. The aerial bombardment was also a waste of bombs, so our army's positions were not damaged at all. On the other hand, our army also retaliated with heavy artillery, repeatedly hitting the enemy's key targets and inflicting heavy losses. When the two sides engaged in skirmishes, the enemy's morale was even weaker. Once they were met with a counterattack, they would collapse and retreat. Our troops would return to their original defenses after each pursuit, so there has been little change in the front lines between the two sides. As for the Zhabei area, the fighting was far less intense than in the Jiangwan area. The enemy's artillery fired about several hundred rounds per hour. Yesterday, the artillery battles lasted all day. The enemy also used aircraft to assist in the battle, dropping more than ten bombs. As a result, only one of our soldiers was killed. The enemy's consumption and waste are welcomed by our army. Currently, the positions of the two armies are very close, and our army's fortifications are extremely strong. The enemy has not dared to attack with infantry. In short, it is absolutely impossible for the enemy to cross the Rubicon.</p>
<h3>Skirmishes Occur at the Racecourse</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, starting at 8:00 PM last night, the enemy in the city center advanced west along Sanmin Road and engaged our outposts in the Lijiashai, Beijizhai, and Dongzhai areas north of the Jiangwan Racecourse. The enemy knew that our defenses were strong and dared not penetrate deeply. Recently, the enemy has planned to occupy the Jiangwan Racecourse and open it as an airport, so they have repeatedly attacked, hoping to force our outposts to retreat. However, as of last night, the enemy's attempt had not been realized. The racecourse is our defense line, and our outposts and the enemy's are very close.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Attacking Baoshan Road is Defeated</h3>
<p>Holding on for Two Hours, Killing More Than Twenty Enemies</p>
<p>Around 2:00 PM yesterday, a company of enemy naval marines, advanced from Qiujiang Road and Guangdong Street towards our Shishan Road position. At the same time, enemy warships continuously shelled, and more than ten enemy aircraft, divided into several small teams, also reconnoitered back and forth in the sky above the area, dropping bombs and strafing with machine guns. Our troops relied on solid defensive fortifications and calmly resisted, holding on for about two hours, killing more than twenty enemies, and finally repulsing them. We also suffered one death and two injuries. At the time, it was reported that one enemy aircraft was shot down and destroyed by our anti-aircraft artillery, but our military spokesman could not confirm this.</p>
<p>Starting the night before last (the 27th), the enemy in the Jiangwan area attacked our Zhizhi University position in three directions. Our troops calmly responded, fighting fiercely all night. At 0:30 AM yesterday morning, after dispersing the enemy's formation, the enemy could not hold on and retreated. We then dispatched a machine gun team to pursue from Xinshi Road, launching a fierce attack on the east end of the enemy's position at the Jiangwan Road Patriotic Women's School, sweeping with concentrated fire and inflicting many casualties on the enemy. The enemy could not hold on and retreated. We did not advance deeply. By 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the gunfire gradually subsided, with only small skirmishes between outposts.</p>
<h3>We Firmly Hold the Yong'an Bridge Area</h3>
<p>Solid Fortifications, the Enemy Will Hardly Invade Again</p>
<p>On the Liuhang Line, after our army recovered the Yong'an Bridge, they advanced victoriously, routing the retreating enemy troops, who were in a terrible state. After our troops recovered the important villages, they quickly repaired the fortifications left by the enemy. At dawn the day before yesterday, the retreating enemy troops launched a fierce counterattack on our Yong'an Bridge area. In addition to artillery fire cover, enemy aircraft and tanks were also active at the same time. Our troops took advantage of the momentum of their recent victory and bravely fought back, launching a fierce attack on the enemy troops. Our artillery also retaliated, firing at the enemy. From morning to night, the battle was quite fierce. As night fell, the enemy's momentum gradually weakened, and they retreated. The fighting subsided slightly. At midnight, another enemy force attempted to attack, but our troops were already prepared. The enemy had been repulsed the day before. Currently, our troops are firmly holding the Yong'an Bridge area, which is extremely solid. The enemy will definitely have difficulty invading again.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in the Liuhang area, after our troops recovered the Jinjiawan and Yong'an Bridge areas, they continued to bravely pursue the enemy, approaching the enemy's positions in the Yanghang area. Our troops steadily and firmly established a defensive line there. The day before yesterday (the 27th), the enemy received reinforcements and attacked us again. Our troops bravely fought back, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle. We are currently firmly defending the Yong'an Bridge area, and the enemy has no power to counterattack.</p>
<p>The enemy in the Yanghang area, due to the setbacks on the front lines in recent days, suffered heavy losses, and the morale of their soldiers has been lost. Therefore, that line has been under pressure from our army and has retreated into the Bao'anxiang area. Our army took advantage of the victory to advance along the Bao-Liu Highway. The vanguard has reached Zhujia Youche, Fushou'an, Xiaomiaocun, Lujia Yan, etc. At dawn yesterday morning, the enemy again attacked our Zhujia Youche position, and the two sides engaged in a fierce battle. But after half an hour, the fighting gradually subsided, becoming sporadic. When the enemy saw that there was no possibility of advancing, they retreated. Our army guarded the Yong'an Bridge, with Zhujia Youche and Fushou Temple as forward defense positions. That area is about three li from Yanghang Town.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Attacking Toujia Town are Bravely Repulsed by Our Troops</h3>
<p>The Two Armies Engage in a Fierce Battle for Twelve Hours. Enemy Troops in Yangjiufang Construct Fortifications.</p>
<p>Suzhou, July 7th, Central News Agency. According to reliable information from the front, in the Liuhang area, several hundred enemy troops, starting at 4:00 AM on the 27th, attacked our Gujia Town southwest of Liuhang, covered by nine tanks. Several enemy aircraft also indiscriminately bombed our positions in the sky above. Our troops immediately fought bravely, advancing without retreating. This battle, which started at 4:00 AM at dawn, stopped at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The two armies engaged in a fierce battle for as long as twelve hours. The enemy finally retreated, and the enemy tanks were also repelled by our small anti-tank guns. Our troops did not stop pursuing and continued to strictly defend the lines. The two sides are currently in a standoff. At the same time, three or four hundred enemy troops are constructing fortifications in Yangjiufang to defend against our attacks.</p>
<h3>More Than Three Hundred Enemies Annihilated in Hejiaxiang</h3>
<p>At 11:00 PM the night before last (the 27th), our troops in Hejiaxiang attacked the enemy's position in the Sijing Ballfield. They also used a large force to outflank Dongzhai and cut off the enemy's retreat on Xianggu Road. As a result, fierce engagements broke out on both lines. After three or four hours of stalemate, our army, with its strong strength, advanced steadily. The enemy initially thought that the defenses on this line were not as solid as those in Zhabei, so after repeatedly failing to attack Zhizhi University, they became active in this area. After this fierce battle, more than three hundred enemies were annihilated, one enemy tank was destroyed, and many rifles were seized. The enemy, realizing that they could not succeed, retreated towards the city center.</p>
<p>Last night, our reconnaissance soldiers sneaked into the enemy's positions in the city center to scout out the enemy's military situation. According to their report, the enemy is constructing fortifications around the area, seemingly to defend against our army's counterattack and to try to occupy the area for a long time.</p>
<h3>Enemy Vessels Harass the Pudong Area Separately</h3>
<p>Around 8:00 PM the night before last, enemy warships off the Hongkou coast again provoked our army's positions in Pudong with artillery fire. Our artillery positions also retaliated with heavy artillery. The booming sounds shook the surrounding areas. Around 9:00 PM, the enemy took advantage of the fierce artillery battle and dispatched three motorboats, carrying about sixty soldiers, which appeared at the Qintong Wharf in Pudong and strafed the north bank with machine guns. Our machine gun team fought back bravely, showering them with bullets. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy boats turned and sailed upstream to the Nanyang Wharf, the Cemetery Wharf, and the Chunjiang Wharf, again attacking. They were all met with a strong machine gun barrage by our forces. The enemy boats immediately retreated and sailed to the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory Wharf of a British merchant north of the Cemetery Wharf. About fifty enemy soldiers quietly climbed ashore. But the enemy soldiers were as timid as mice, sneaking around furtively. They lingered in the factory for more than ten minutes, deeply afraid of being ambushed by our forces. Then, they fled back to the Pudong beach, boarded the boats, and sped away. Late at 11:00 PM, another fierce artillery battle broke out between us and the enemy. Suddenly, the number of enemy boats increased to four, and they spread out towards the Chunjiang Wharf and the coast, attempting to land by surprise. The two sides exchanged machine gun fire. Our machine gunners had excellent skills and calmly and unhurriedly met them with a head-on blow. Although the enemy soldiers used steel plates for cover, they were still hit and wounded. After about two or three hours of fierce fighting, the enemy boats could not hold on and fled in all directions. The enemy, after suffering these two disastrous defeats, lowered their flags and silenced their drums, pretending to be dormant and becoming very quiet.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Bombarded in All Directions Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 7:00 AM yesterday, an enemy seaplane suddenly took off from the Izumo flagship and dropped a bomb behind the Longmao Warehouse in Pudong, then immediately flew back to its original ship. Its coming and going was hasty and panicked, showing the weakness of the enemy's air force.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, nine enemy aircraft in the Pudong area reconnoitered at low altitude for a long time and dropped two bombs. At the same time, enemy warships moored in Pudong fired dozens of rounds at our Pudong area. Our side immediately retaliated. Another four enemy aircraft flew at low altitude in the South Shanghai area for a long time and dropped four bombs on the Longhua Airport.</p>
<p>After 9:30 AM yesterday, three enemy aircraft circled high in the sky above our positions in Zhabei. Our side used anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns to fire at them. The enemy aircraft did not dare to fly low, but still dropped more than ten large bombs indiscriminately. Three of our civilians were killed. At noon, two enemy aircraft again dropped bombs in the sky above Zhabei. Our losses were minimal.</p>
<p>From around 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM yesterday, enemy aircraft continuously dropped heavy bombs in Zhabei, most of which fell in the area north of the North Railway Station and Baoshan Road. After 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the enemy in the city center again launched a fierce bombardment on us with heavy artillery. We also fired back, the sound of which was even louder than the enemy's artillery. Our shells all landed north of Beisichuan Road and east of Laobazi Road, that is, the section of the Disiqi Road triangular vegetable market within the enemy's occupied area. Most of the enemy shells fell on the wasteland west of Zhongxing Road North and Gonghexin Road. Around 2:00 PM, four enemy aircraft came again, divided into two teams, circling successively in the skies above Baoshan Road, Zhongxing Road, Datong Road, and the Suzhou Creek. Each aircraft dropped multiple heavy bombs, which also landed north of Binshan Road and Qiujiang Road. They were later repelled by our army with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns. It seemed that several aircraft were hit and damaged.</p>
<p>At 5:50 PM yesterday afternoon, an enemy aircraft circled over Minhang for several weeks. The aircraft dropped a bomb near Wujiadu, about five or six li east of the town, which exploded on the spot. At that time, three or five villagers were casting nets to fish, resulting in one person being injured by the blast. At 8:30 AM this morning, two enemy heavy bombers reconnoitered at low altitude over the Longhua Airport and dropped four bombs. One fell on the China National Aviation Corporation building, and two fell near the entrance of the Eurasia Company, all of which exploded, killing one person.</p>
<h3>Jiading Yarn Factory Destroyed by Enemy Bombing</h3>
<p>According to people from Jiading yesterday, around 4:00 PM on the 27th, eleven enemy aircraft flew to the sky above Jiading and dropped bombs, the most intense bombing being in the Hou Huanghou area outside the West Gate. The Jiafeng Yarn Factory nearby was hit by four heavy bombs and suffered significant damage. This factory is the only yarn factory in Jiading, which shows the enemy's intention to destroy our national industries.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarine Sinks Our Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>Regarding the incident of a Japanese submarine sinking a Chinese fishing boat in the waters near Hong Kong, according to a Reuters report on the 27th, twelve Chinese fishing boats were fishing outside of Mou Lang Hook (transliteration) on September 22 when they were attacked by a Japanese submarine. Only one fishing boat escaped, and more than three hundred fishermen were drowned. Only ten people were rescued by the German merchant ship Horst and transported to Hong Kong to land. Regarding this matter, the Domei News Agency denied it yesterday. However, in its draft issued in the morning, it stated that the merchant ship Horst did not pass through the waters near Hong Kong that day. In the afternoon, the agency issued a draft, cancelling the draft issued in the morning, and issued another draft, stating that there were no Japanese submarines near Xiamen or at the exit of Kowloon at that time. It can be seen that its intention is to deny the truth, showing contradictions and trying to cover up the truth.</p>
<h3>Our Military Spokesperson Rebuts Enemy Propaganda</h3>
<p>Ordering Arms is Never Within the Authority of Administrative Agencies. Only Japan in the World Possesses a Large Number of Dumdum Bullets. Fabricating Rumors Clearly Serves Another Purpose.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Domei News Agency quoted a spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry as saying that when the Japanese army occupied the city center of Shanghai, it had found a contract for the Chinese side to purchase 45 million dumdum bullets from a certain country and had also obtained information on a huge amount of such bullets. Our military spokesperson rebutted the above news, saying that ordering arms is never within the authority of administrative agencies. In other words, the municipal government has no right to order arms from foreign countries. Moreover, dumdum bullets are cruel instruments of killing that are not allowed by international public opinion. We have no such thing. The Japanese spokesman also did not specify which country the so-called "certain country" was. Based on past combat experience, we know that only one country in the world possesses such a large number of cruel instruments, and that is Japan. Therefore, this fabricated rumor by the Japanese side clearly serves another purpose. Moreover, just as the enemy has repeatedly falsely accused our side of using sneezing gas at receptions for foreign reporters, the matter is consistent and not worth refuting. We speculate that this is because the enemy has paid a great price and suffered great losses in the fighting in Shanghai, but is still at a loss. Therefore, they have resorted to this tactic of spreading rumors and slander to cover up their own cruel actions of using poison gas or other actions that violate international law.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Civilians, Violating International Law</h3>
<p>Foreign Scholars of Public Law Offer Incisive Discussions. Forcefully Rebutting the Fallacies of Enemy Military Attache Honda</p>
<p>According to the Mainland News, Rear Admiral Honda, naval attache of the Japanese Embassy, stated on Sunday that the bombing of non-combatants by Japanese aircraft is permitted by international law. A representative of the Mainland News yesterday visited several foreign scholars of public law in the Japanese Concession to solicit their opinions. According to them, after the Washington Naval Conference in 1923, the Hague convened an Air Commission, which passed several resolutions, but none of them have been ratified by the governments of the participating countries, including Japan. The principles cited by Honda to justify the bombing of civilians by Japanese aircraft have not been recognized by various countries and have not been included in international law. Observers in this concession believe that Honda's statement must have been consulted with Professor Teng Wu, the legal advisor of the Japanese Third Fleet, and his opinion was sought. Professor Teng also held this position during the January 28 Incident in Shanghai in 1932 and authored the book "International Law of the Shanghai War" in 1932. His words can be cited to attack Honda's fallacies, for his book says that "In 1922-23," the Committee of Public Law Advisors representing six countries drafted the rules of war for air warfare and the rules for radio management in wartime, but they were not included in any international convention. " Foreign scholars of public law also said that the two sides' explorations of the Hague regulations to prove the legitimacy of the Japanese aircraft's atrocities have all forgotten the most affirmative clauses in the proposed regulations, or deliberately ignored them, and one of the two must be true. If the Japanese government believes that the Hague Regulations have been implemented and are in effect, then although they have not recognized them, the following facts are very relevant to the issue of bombing non-combatants. Article 22 of the Hague Regulations states, "Sky bombardment aimed at intimidating civilians, destroying private property of a non-military nature, or injuring non-combatants is prohibited." Furthermore, Article 24, Section 2 states: "It is forbidden to bombard towns, villages, houses, or any buildings that do not approach the combat zone of land forces. If the target objects listed in Section 2 (military construction, arsenals, transportation lines, etc.) are located there, and the bombardment poses a danger to civilians, the aircraft must not be bombed repeatedly." The fundamental principle of international law is that non-combatants must not be directly bombarded on land, sea, or in the sky. This principle was recently included in a resolution passed by the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference in 1932. The resolution stated, "Attacks from the sky on civilians should be absolutely prohibited." This is the resolution that was agreed upon in the first act of the important conference.</p>
<h3>Threatened by Our Air Force, Many Enemy Aircraft Were Destroyed by Bombing</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft at the Airfield at the End of Yangshupu Road are Towed to Other Locations Every Evening</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy took advantage of the concession to operate in the open space at the end of Yangshupu Road, which was opened as an airfield and served as the base for enemy land aircraft. After receiving the report, our air force launched a night attack, dropping many bombs there and destroying many enemy aircraft, suffering heavy losses. According to eyewitnesses, the enemy aircraft are now towed along Yangshupu Road and other roads to be parked there every evening. This happens every day, which shows that our air force has posed a major threat to the enemy.</p>

<p>[Guangzhou] Enemy aircraft attacked Guangdong twice on the morning of the 28th. The first time, when enemy aircraft flew to Lianshi Bay, they dropped bombs on our warship "Wufeng" anchored there. Our troops retaliated, and after a fierce battle of half an hour, the enemy aircraft retreated. It is reported that the "Wufeng" was slightly damaged. The second time, enemy aircraft attacked Conghua in batches, about twenty or more aircraft, dropping bombs in the vicinity, destroying several residences and killing and injuring dozens of farmers. When the enemy aircraft left the urban area, they passed over Huangpu and dropped four bombs, most of which landed in the wilderness, causing no major losses to us.

<p>[Nanjing] Twenty-three enemy aircraft, divided into two teams, came to the capital at noon on the 28th in an attempt to carry out an air raid. Our air force received the report and went to intercept them. At 12:30 PM, a fierce battle broke out in the suburbs of the capital. More than ten enemy aircraft took the opportunity to sneak into the airspace of the capital. Our anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns fired volleys, and the enemy aircraft circled once and fled. The enemy troops fighting outside the city were greatly threatened and hurriedly fled towards Jiaxing. Our Nanjing troops bravely pursued them, and at night, a bomber was shot down and set on fire over Jiaxing. The aircraft completed their mission and returned to their defenses safely. Investigation after the event revealed that the enemy aircraft dropped a large number of bombs in Wuhu, Huaiyin, and Jurong, and the losses are being investigated.

<p>[Nanjing] Thirty Japanese aircraft, divided into two teams of seventeen and thirteen, attacked the capital shortly after noon today and then flew to Wuhu and various points upstream of the Yangtze River. The team of seventeen aircraft attacked the capital at 12:30 PM, but the public only saw six of them. Half an hour after the alarm was issued, enemy aircraft appeared in the sky, coming from the south in groups of three, dropping more than ten bombs from the clouds in the southeast and south of the city, and dropping bombs on the military airfield outside Guanghua Gate and the ordnance factory outside the South Gate. Anti-aircraft fire immediately erupted. Ten minutes later, the enemy aircraft disappeared into the clouds and flew away. Within five minutes of the alarm being issued, four Chinese fighter planes took off to engage the enemy, but by 12:40 PM, enemy aircraft were no longer visible in the sky, so the four planes returned safely at 12:50 PM. According to a report from the Air Force Headquarters, a team of thirteen aircraft appeared over Jurong, Lishui, and Dantu at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, dropped bombs, and then proceeded towards Wuhu.

<p>[Nanjing] When enemy aircraft bombed Pukou on the 17th noon, the Jinpu Railway Bureau suffered considerable losses. Investigation reveals that the ten or more bombs dropped by enemy aircraft in Pukou were all heavy bombs. The railway car shed was destroyed, and the water tower and vehicle tracks were also severely damaged. Civilian houses in the Xiaoneihe area were bombed, resulting in even more tragic deaths and injuries. The most cruel was the fate of hundreds of refugees waiting to be transported north, who were almost all killed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] When enemy aircraft attacked Nanjing on the 25th, the godown of the British-owned Xiangtai Timber Company on the riverbank in Xiaguan was also bombed, with two bombs destroying a large amount of timber. The company has reported this to its head office for transmission to the British government for negotiations with Japan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] Seven enemy seaplanes flew from Hangzhou Bay via Haiyan and Haining to Hangzhou at 8:30 AM on the 28th, circling and reconnoitering over Jianqiao, dropping thirteen bombs and strafing with machine guns for a long time. Three aircraft flew low to reconnoiter the urban area. Our anti-aircraft guns and artillery fired in unison, densely like continuous pearls. The enemy also returned fire before flying away in a panic along their original route. We suffered no significant losses. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] After seven enemy aircraft bombed Hangzhou, more than ten aircraft returned for a second attack at 11:20 AM, circling and dropping bombs in Jiashan, Jiaxing, Tongxiang, and Xiashi. They flew away at 3:30 PM. One aircraft was hit by our fire and landed at Tudian Yanxi Ningqiao. The three airmen were unharmed. Farmers came forward to surround and capture them, but they used machine guns to strafe, and escaped. At 4:00 PM, two more aircraft came for a third attack, dropping several bombs in Tongxiang and Xiashi, with no losses. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Hangzhou] At 4:45 PM on the 27th, seven enemy aircraft flew to Yin County and dropped eight bombs, as well as many packets of yellow and white poison powder. We suffered no losses. The enemy aircraft then fled towards Longshan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Fifteen Japanese aircraft flew to Wuhu this afternoon to bomb the city. According to reports received in Nanjing tonight, Japanese aircraft dropped as many as a hundred bombs, causing two major fires. The number of civilian deaths and injuries is still being determined. It is strange that Wuhu was bombed today, as the Japanese had previously stated that it was safer for foreigners to take refuge in Wuhu. Moreover, after Japan issued a warning to bomb Nanjing, the British warship HMS Peterel, as well as several foreign merchant ships, including the Whangpoo, with many British nationals taking refuge on them, had moved to Wuhu, upstream of the Yangtze River. It was reported that Chinese aircraft intercepted the Japanese aircraft twice over Zhenjiang and Nanjing, and the Chinese side reported that two enemy aircraft were shot down.

<h3>One Enemy Aircraft Attacking Guangzhou Shot Down into the Sea by Us</h3>
<p>Six airmen rescued by British ship; enemy aircraft also crashed near Zhushi yesterday; the pilot escaped and is being searched for.</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Taikoo Shipping Company's ship "Soochow" issued a wireless message stating that it had rescued four Japanese airmen 30 miles off Xiamen. All four were wearing life jackets and swimming in the sea. A destroyed aircraft was floating nearby. This aircraft was probably one of those bombing Guangzhou yesterday, which was hit by the anti-aircraft artillery and forced to land in the sea on its way back to Taiwan. The "Soochow" later notified the British cruiser HMS Suffolk by wireless that the four Japanese airmen had boarded a certain Japanese destroyer at 3:00 AM this morning, and the destroyed aircraft that fell into the sea had sunk outside the port of Xiamen at 3:00 PM yesterday. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Japanese airmen rescued by the Taikoo Shipping Company's ship "Soochow" 30 miles off Xiamen totaled six, four of whom were injured. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Central News Agency News: Transportation sources confirm that at 10:45 AM yesterday morning, an enemy bomber flew to reconnaissance between the two stations of Xiashi and Wangdian on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway. Due to mechanical failure, it was forced to land in Dadianmiao Township, about six miles from Xiashi. When the three crew members were trying to repair it, they were discovered by our villagers, who gathered a crowd to approach. The enemy then fired their guns indiscriminately at the crowd. The villagers, being unarmed, scattered and reported to our garrison. When they returned, the three crew members had escaped and are now being searched for. The aircraft is still intact. The engine has the number "14" on it, and the fuselage has two bombs. Inside the aircraft are two machine guns and a parachute with the words "Folding Certificate 0208" on it. It is now under the guard of the garrison. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>The Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Bureau Streamlines Freight Transport</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Freight transport on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway is not smooth. In order to streamline it, less-than-carload freight transport is being handled.

<h3>The League of Nations Assembly Condemns Japanese Military Atrocities</h3>
<p>Resolution of the Advisory Committee passed; a powerful expression of upholding justice.</p>
<p>[Geneva] The International Assembly today passed the resolution proposed by the Advisory Committee of Twenty-Three Nations, condemning the Japanese Air Force for bombing Chinese cities and massacring civilians. Fifty-two countries voted in favor. This is the first time that such a severe expression has been adopted against a powerful country. When Assembly President Aga Khan declared the resolution passed, the entire hall resounded with thunderous applause, a scene of unprecedented enthusiasm. Aga Khan then invited Chinese representative Gu Weijun to the podium to address the assembly. Gu said, "On behalf of the Chinese delegation, I express my gratitude to the assembly for unanimously passing the resolution. I firmly believe that this is clear evidence that the League of Nations is upholding humanitarianism and international ethics, and will surely be endorsed by civilized countries around the world." (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Before the vote in the Assembly, Spanish representative Valderrama spoke, saying that Spain and China share the same fate. We condemn the bombing of Nanjing, and at the same time, we should condemn the bombing of Madrid. He added, "I sincerely hope that this fair and just resolution will express our solidarity and friendship with the Chinese people. We can guarantee that we are fighting for the same purpose as the Chinese people, which is none other than national independence." (Central News Agency Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue of the League of Nations Assembly held an open meeting this afternoon. Chairman Manteš, the Latvian Foreign Minister, as well as American observer and Minister to Switzerland Harrison, and Australian representative Bruce were also present. Chinese representative and Ambassador to France Dr. Gu Weijun delivered a speech, stating that Japanese aircraft bombing Chinese civilians violated the most basic principles of international law and humanitarianism, which should at least be condemned by the League of Nations and China should be encouraged to stop the war. British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne immediately suggested that the bombing of Chinese cities without defensive works by Japanese aircraft be condemned. French Foreign Minister Daladier, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, and Soviet diplomatic commissioner Litvinov all expressed their approval. The committee then adjourned to draft a resolution and then reconvened. After a long discussion, it was finally passed and submitted to the League of Nations Assembly for approval.</p>
<h3>Content of the Resolution</h3>
<p>"This committee has just used the emergency procedure to discuss the issue of the Japanese Air Force bombing Chinese cities without defensive works. It is deeply shocked by the tragic deaths of innocent Chinese civilians, including many women and children. This is also vehemently rejected by people all over the world. This committee hereby declares that this kind of behavior by the Japanese Air Force is inexcusable and solemnly condemns it." (Central News Agency Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Collective Sanctions Against Japan Depend on the Attitude of the United States</h3>
<p>[London] After the Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue of the League of Nations Assembly passed the resolution, well-informed British sources said that the content of the resolution clearly pointed to Japan without the slightest disguise. Therefore, it is not necessarily impossible for the League of Nations Assembly to propose suggestions for sanctions against Japan. Whether Britain participates in this matter depends on the attitude of the United States. However, so far, the United States has not been very supportive of the proposal for joint action to deal with Japan. In addition, according to news from Geneva, the United States is about to participate in a conference of Pacific countries. British sources were quite surprised to hear this, as the United States has never supported this matter. (Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<h3>Consultative Committee Session: Gu Weijun's Earnest Speech</h3>
<p>Brutal Japanese Aggression Threatens World Peace: Calls for Practical and Effective Measures</p>
<p>[Geneva] The League of Nations General Assembly's Consultative Committee on the Sino-Japanese issue passed a resolution today, solemnly condemning the Japanese Air Force's bombing actions. A separate telegram has already reported on this. Now, the speeches delivered by Chinese representative Dr. Gu Weijun, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne, and French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos are provided as a supplement below. Dr. Gu Weijun first stated that the current situation in the Far East is extremely serious. Not only are China's national security and the welfare of its people threatened, but the future of the League of Nations and world peace are also jeopardized. Since his speech at the League of Nations General Assembly on the 15th of this month, Japan has transported large numbers of troops and armaments to China. Furthermore, the Japanese Air Force has again engaged in inhumane collective killings, attempting to intimidate Chinese civilians with terror. This bombing is a display of contempt for international law and human conscience. "Japanese troops are now invading China by land, sea, and air. Regardless of what incidents occurred at the beginning of the conflict, the invasion is an act of aggression, or these so-called incidents were created by Japan as a pretext to implement its plans for territorial conquest." China has striven to find peaceful solutions and appealed to the signatories of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, but Japan has disregarded these efforts and continued to pursue its policy of force. This is a challenge to the League of Nations, and the member states of the League of Nations have an obligation under Article 10 of the Covenant to protect the territorial integrity and political independence of all member states against external aggression. Japan's true intentions are now crystal clear. In short, it seeks to enslave and conquer China in order to realize its so-called sacred mission. What is this mission? It is to control all of Asia and the Pacific, and from there to further control the world. While we may regard this intention as a dream, it is a threat to world peace and the security of all nations. It can be asserted that although Japanese politicians say that China lacks sincerity and must be punished, what crime has China committed to deserve such punishment? Is it because China refuses to automatically surrender and kiss the feet of the Japanese? What kind of sincerity does Japan demand from China? Is it to have China at Japan's beck and call, to be summoned at will? Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota's reply to the Consultative Committee's note expressed dissatisfaction with China's anti-Japanese movement and hoped that China would change its attitude. "Does this mean that while Japan continuously invades Chinese territory, deliberately kills innocent Chinese men, women, and children, destroys assets worth tens of thousands of dollars, and continuously seizes Chinese provinces with its powerful military force, detaching them from the Chinese political structure province after province, without end, China should still express friendship and love towards Japan and be grateful for it?" The League of Nations' attitude towards Japan is often criticized, for three reasons: First, Japan violates international law and existing international treaties, such as the Paris Peace Pact and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. Second, Japan incites war, tramples on Chinese territory, and torments the lives of the Chinese people. Third, world peace and the security of other nations are threatened. Dr. Gu Weijun then reviewed the various practical measures that the League of Nations could implement, stating that even if the League of Nations cannot guarantee the rule of law to counter force, it should at least condemn the country that destroys the rule of law before all the nations of the world. Even if the League of Nations cannot implement international law and the principles of the League of Nations Covenant, it should at least show that it has not abandoned these principles. Even if the League of Nations cannot stop the inhumane and illegal aerial bombing, so that innocent people will not be slaughtered and assets will not be destroyed, it should at least publicly express its feelings to strengthen the voice of civilized nations. All that these nations demand is an immediate cessation of this inhumane and illegal method. For the sake of its own prestige and maintaining peace, the League of Nations must condemn Japan's acts of aggression and its bombing of Chinese cities. Regarding the bombing actions, Britain and the United States have protested to Tokyo. As for Japan's claims that Chinese troops used poison gas, this is entirely unfounded. Japan merely wants to use gas itself, so it slanders China in advance as a pretext. The indiscriminate killing of Chinese civilians by Japanese planes is unprecedented in its severity, and world culture has also been threatened as a result. The impact may not spare European and American countries. In accordance with Articles 23 and 25 of the Covenant, the League of Nations also bears a humanitarian duty. At the very least, the League of Nations should issue a ruling on the illegal and inhumane bombing of civilians and recommend that member governments take appropriate measures to prevent the recurrence of the slaughter of innocent civilians. As for the issues of stopping aggression and encouraging the victims of aggression to resist, the obligations of the member states of the League of Nations under the Covenant are very clear and need no further elaboration. Although the Chinese government is not satisfied with the experience it has gained in the past, it still believes that the League of Nations can recommend that member states take some practical measures. However, the Consultative Committee should study what measures should be implemented immediately to effectively aid China. We now also request that the League of Nations implement various measures within its power to encourage and assist China, which is suffering from aggression. On behalf of humanity and for the sake of justice and world peace, I sincerely hope that the Consultative Committee will work quickly and succeed, and not get bogged down in procedural issues, causing the main issues to remain unresolved." After Gu's speech,</p>
<h3>Speeches by British and French Representatives</h3>
<p>The British representative, British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Lord Cranborne, stated that the Consultative Committee was deeply moved by the Chinese representative's statement. "There is one measure that we can take immediately, which is to express our deep abhorrence of the bombing of Chinese civilians in clear terms. The British government has already protested against the damage caused to British-flagged individuals and property in China by the war. However, the current issue is no longer a matter of the private interests of any country, but involves the whole world. If this illegal bombing is allowed to continue unchecked, whether human civilization can be preserved is doubtful. The French representative, French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos, also spoke in the same tone, saying, "If we ignore this crime, we will be no different from accomplices. Not only will we fail to stand by China, but we will also be guilty of wronging ourselves. If we turn a deaf ear, the whole world will be threatened. Therefore, we must condemn this mode of warfare. In addition to condemning it again in the name of France, France is willing to participate in any expression that can be used to condemn this non-belligerent method and that can be responded to by civilized nations."</p>
<h3>Russian and Swedish Speeches in Support</h3>
<p>Swedish representative Sandler expressed full agreement with the views and suggestions of the British and French representatives, believing that the Consultative Committee must express its views immediately and should not delay. Soviet representative Litvinov also expressed complete agreement with the British proposal to condemn Japan's wanton bombing, and stated that while the Consultative Committee opposes this method of warfare by Japan, it should not ignore Japan's other methods of attack.</p>
<p>The Consultative Committee then adjourned for fifteen minutes to draft a draft resolution, which was passed after the meeting resumed (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas dispatch).</p>
<h3>Belgium Elected as Non-Permanent Director</h3>
<p>[Geneva] At its opening meeting in the new assembly hall today, the League of Nations General Assembly elected Belgium as a non-permanent director of the Administrative Council. Belgium received 47 votes out of 52, with the remainder being spoiled ballots (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Just English Newspaper Editorial</h3>
<p>Contempt for Humanity, Shame on Civilization</p>
<p>[London] Today's editorial in The Times stated, "It is rare for a country to be intolerable to world opinion, but Japan is an exception. As can be seen from the speeches in Geneva yesterday, Japan is waging its undeclared war against China arbitrarily and recklessly. Its acts of terror are escalating, and the world is now watching its actions with anger and disgust. Japanese Navy Minister Yonai recently stated in the Diet that the Imperial Navy would never commit inhumane acts. This statement, though lofty, is merely a despicable adornment to the Imperial Japanese Navy's systematic destruction of entire fleets of Chinese fishing boats. This crime is not only a great outrage against the world, but also a shame to the general Japanese people who still boast of the spirit of Yamato and chivalry. The tragedy of the Japanese army's massacres is made even more appalling by the countless number of wounded. In this regard, we earnestly hope that British sympathizers will soon have the opportunity to send medical supplies to recognized organizations to help these innocent victims. The methods adopted by Japan to destroy China's courage to resist have aroused the contempt of other countries, and have especially stirred up public opinion in Britain and the United States to the extent that Japan will eventually regret it. Japan's adoption of barbaric tactics, even if not a sign of its panic, is certainly a sign of its impatience and anxiety. In fact, Japan's actions will only bring about a disaster more serious than what the Chinese army, which is good at avoiding and indestructible, can do. Japan will ultimately rely on the world for survival, both in peacetime and in wartime, but it has now earned the unanimous contempt of the world." (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>Enemy Implements Poison Gas Policy to Weaken Our Resistance</h3>
<p>Hu Shize's Speech at the League of Nations Committee, Japan Uniquely Absent</p>
<p>[Geneva] At a meeting of the League of Nations Fifth Committee (Social Issues) today, Chinese Chief Representative Minister Hu Shize stated that, "In this struggle against the proliferation of poisons, the number one public enemy is Japan." Hu pointed out that, "According to official reports, 90 percent of the world's illicit white drug trafficking originates from Japan. Most of these factories are located in Chinese territory controlled by Japan, and production in these areas is rapidly increasing, but the Japanese government does not stop it. For ten years, Japan has repeatedly made statements, but its promises are never fulfilled." Because Japan's condoning and encouragement of drug production in China is a strategy to weaken China's resistance. (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters dispatch).</p>
<p>[Geneva] Since withdrawing from the League of Nations in 1933, the Japanese government has continued to participate in various technical organs belonging to the League of Nations. However, when the League of Nations Advisory Committee on Opium Problems met today, the Japanese representative was absent. This is the first repercussion of the current conflict between China and Japan (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas dispatch).</p>
<h3>East Newspaper Spreads Rumors</h3>
<p>Britain Denies Bombing Black People</p>
<p>[London] Japanese newspapers have recently reported that Britain bombed black people in East Africa. Britain has now vehemently denied this, saying that since the British flag was raised over Tanganyika, there have been no bombings of natives (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters dispatch).</p>
<h3>US Government Watches the Far East Situation Closely</h3>
<p>Especially Concerned About China's Tax Revenue, 200 US Sailors Open to Shanghai</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull, when meeting with news reporters today, discussed the establishment of customs by the Japanese in the Shanghai area, saying that the US government is now studying the overall situation in China with the utmost concern, which may develop as it did from 1922 to 1923, when Japan forcibly seized control of the customs sub-offices in Manchuria. Hull also said that he was unaware of the reports from Geneva that the United States had agreed to participate in the London conference to discuss the Far East issue (Central News Agency, 27th, Reuters dispatch).</p>

<h3>Rumors of Doihara Meeting with Han Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Flew to Jinan Yesterday Dropping Absurd Documents, Our Determination to Resist Has No Room for Compromise</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Yesterday, foreign telegrams reported that the Japanese side claimed that they would send Doihara to Jinan to meet with Han Fuju to persuade him to accept the Japanese demands and implement the autonomy of the five provinces. According to reliable information from the Geng Mansion, no enemy personnel have arrived in Jinan in recent days in Shandong Province. Only eight enemy planes dropped a communication bag over Jinan on the morning of the 26th, containing documents similar to letters, with extremely absurd wording. Our local authorities are extremely indignant, believing that our country's resistance in this war is a national consensus. As long as the enemy's troops do not leave, our country's resistance will not stop. There is no room for compromise. The enemy still wants to use the old tricks of division at this time, attempting to undermine our united front against Japan. It can be said that their efforts are futile and hateful and ridiculous.

<h3>Victory News from Northern Shanxi</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>In the depressing atmosphere of the unsuccessful battles on the Ping-Sui Railway Line, news of the victory of the Eighth Route Army in northern Shanxi has arrived. Since being ordered to go north, the Eighth Route Army has been intercepting the invading Japanese troops in the Pingxingguan area of northern Shanxi. On the 23rd, they first annihilated most of the Suzuki Division of the Itagaki Detachment, killing 2,000 enemy soldiers and capturing 2,500. On the 25th, they again drove forward, cutting off the road from Lingqiu to Guangling to block the enemy's path and seizing countless military supplies. This is the first victory since the war in North China. It is also the first good news since the announcement of cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The people of the whole country are extremely excited, because this victory not only changed the situation on the Ping-Han and Ping-Sui Railway Lines, but also proved the loyalty and courage of the soldiers of the Eighth Route Army in defending the country, and the greatness of the strength of the Kuomintang-Communist cooperation. After ten years of painful lessons, the comrades of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have finally united to kill the enemy under the cruel invasion of the Japanese invaders. This is indeed even more joyful and moving than the military victory in northern Shanxi.</p>
<p>Of course, our war of resistance is a comprehensive and sustained war of resistance. Temporary victories or defeats, and the gains or losses of one place, are not enough to sway our joy or sorrow. However, from this initial progress in northern Shanxi, we have learned a profound lesson. That is, to ensure the victory of the war of resistance, political work must be coordinated with military affairs, and military force must be linked with the masses. We know that the Eighth Route Army's victory this time was not due to sophisticated weapons, nor was it due to modern mechanized units. These are what they sorely lack. The Eighth Route Army was able to defeat the stubborn enemy entirely because of the army's use of political work and its close association with the masses. The Eighth Route Army excels in guerrilla warfare, and the main condition for guerrilla warfare is the support of the masses.</p>
<p>The fall of Tianjin was due to Song Zheyuan's indecisiveness. The loss of Nankou was due to Liu Ruming's mediocrity and incompetence. The withdrawal from Tianzhen and Datong was due to Li Fuying's dereliction of duty. In the final analysis, it was all due to the lack of political awareness of a few military men, and because the army did not become one with the masses. The masses usually have no good feelings towards the army, and therefore cannot get the support of the masses during wartime. Therefore, from the above two contrasting examples, it is proven that to ensure the victory of the war of resistance, military affairs must be coordinated with political work, and the strength of the army must be linked to the strength of the masses.</p>
<p>From this victory in northern Shanxi, we have experienced this profound revelation. Now, the main battle in North China is about to begin. The positional warfare between Baoding and Cangzhou will be launched simultaneously with the guerrilla warfare in Shanxi, Suiyuan, Hebei, and Chahar. We hope that the loyal and courageous generals in the north and even the whole country, in addition to fighting the enemy bravely, will also pay attention to political work.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also note that although the battle before Pingxingguan has greatly improved our military situation in the northwest, it is only one corner of North China. What we demand is not local progress, but overall victory. Therefore, following the progress of the Eighth Route Army, we are still eagerly listening to the success of the military operations on the Jinpu and Ping-Han Railways. Only the concerted efforts of the troops on all fronts can ensure the improvement of the overall situation in North China.</p>
<h3>British Economist Advocates Boycott of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>London Circles Aroused by Righteous Indignation, Unanimously Advocate Sanctions Against Brutal Japan</p>
<p>[London] The News Chronicle today published an article by economist Sir Arthur Salter advocating a boycott of Japanese goods, agreeing with the suggestion that Japan could not survive if all countries implemented a boycott of Japanese goods, and that even if only the United States and Britain did so, it would be effective. Therefore, Sir Salter urged the British public to strongly support the British government in jointly implementing this plan with other governments. Sir Salter had previously visited China twice as a government consultant to investigate economic affairs (Central News Agency, 28th).</p>
<p>[London] Here, a movement to boycott Japanese goods was launched previously in opposition to the Japanese bombing of Chinese cities. Now, because Japanese submarines recently sank eleven Chinese fishing boats off the coast of Hong Kong for no military reason, killing 300 Chinese fishermen, both male and female, this movement has greatly developed. The British authorities in Hong Kong have now sent personnel to investigate whether any British subjects were among the victims. If so, a serious protest will be lodged with the Japanese government. At present, all sectors of British society, including government circles, are extremely indignant at the methods of warfare used by Japan. The Labor Party organ, the Daily Herald, was the first to advocate a boycott of Japanese goods, followed by the Liberal Party's News Chronicle, which called on all sectors of public opinion to rise up and achieve the boycott, and published a list of Japanese goods that should be boycotted. The same appeal was made by the Manchester Guardian of that party. Even The Times published many letters from readers, all making the same proposal. Former Liberal Prime Minister Lloyd George and the Peace and Reconstruction Movement Committee, chaired by the Free Church, also passed a resolution this afternoon advocating the application of economic pressure on Japan to stop its atrocities against China. In addition, most members of the Labor Party and the Trades Union Congress now advocate that workers in all industries, such as dockworkers, should take collective action to boycott all those who serve Japanese businesses, believing that if Britain could first launch a boycott movement, the United States, France, and other countries would be able to follow suit. The Labor Party's annual congress is scheduled to open in Bournemouth next week, and this issue will certainly be discussed then (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas dispatch).</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb Central Hospital, Britain Urges Japan to Pay Special Attention</h3>
<p>Pointing Out that it Violates Previous Promises, Britain Feels Uneasy About the Actions of Enemy Warships in Southern China</p>
<p>[London] An official announced today that the British government has instructed its ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Clive, to urge the Japanese government to pay attention to the bombing of the Central Hospital in Nanjing by Japanese military planes, saying that this act is a clear violation of the Japanese government's reply to the case of the wounding of British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, in which it stated that it would no longer bomb personnel of a non-military nature (National Electric, 28th).</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the second shelling of Hainan Island in Guangdong Province, China, by Japanese warships, British officials recently stated that after the first shelling of the island by Japanese warships, the French government, because the island is close to French Indochina, instructed its ambassador to Japan, Henri, to lodge a protest with the Japanese government in the middle of last week, with the aim of preventing similar incidents from happening again. It is regrettable that the warships have shelled the island again today. In addition, British politicians are closely watching the reactions that may be caused by the French side, given that the Xisha Islands are now also under the same threat. They believe that if Japanese warships expand their operations in the area of Tokyo Bay, British Hong Kong will inevitably be threatened, which will make Britain feel uneasy (Central News Agency, 27th, Havas dispatch).</p>
<h3>American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou Asks Government to Impose Sanctions</h3>
<p>[Hankou] The American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou held a meeting at Citibank this afternoon, and unanimously passed a resolution to send a telegram to the US Secretary of State urging sanctions against the atrocities of the Japanese army. The original telegram is as follows: (Omitted) The entire American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou is shocked and outraged by the blatant and repeated massacres of innocent Chinese civilians by the aggressor country. In order to uphold humanity and world civilization, the entire membership of this Chamber opposes such barbaric acts and respectfully requests that moral and economic sanctions be imposed quickly to suppress the brutality of the aggressors and to maintain the sanctity of international treaties. (Central News Agency, 28th dispatch).</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides to Establish New Agency</h3>
<p>Planning Board and Resources Bureau Merged, Army Ministry Orders Extension of Military Service</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In order to investigate and implement the important national policies of national resource mobilization, and to review the policies of various departments, the Japanese Cabinet has decided to merge the Planning Board and the Resources Bureau into a new agency, divided into six departments: General Affairs, Planning, Review, Resources 1, Resources 2, and Resources 3. The name of the new agency may be the General Affairs Agency 1. It is internally decided that Taki Zeshio will be the first president. The Cabinet Resources Review Council will also be reorganized into the Cabinet Total Mobilization Review Council, with the Prime Minister concurrently serving as the president, and will recruit figures from the private economic sector (Central News Agency, 28th).</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Army Ministry today issued an order extending the term of military service. As a result of this decree, all Japanese troops sent to China will continue to serve in the military after the expiration of their regular terms (Haitong Electric, 28th).</p>
<h3>Japan's Foreign Trade Deficit is Very Large</h3>
<p>Reaching 780 Million This Year</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Miyako Shimbun reported that since Japan began shipping cash on March 9 of this year, it has shipped over 370 million yen by the end of July. Since then, no announcements have been made. It is now decided that cash shipments will be suspended within the year. It is estimated that the total amount of cash shipments this year will be around 550 million yen, of which several million yen were shipped to the UK, and the rest were shipped to the US. As of September 20, the trade deficit this year has reached 781 million yen. Because there are income from marine insurance and other non-trade income, the above-mentioned amount of cash shipments can be used to settle international payments (Central News Agency, Gan 8).</p>
<h3>International Press Association Cables Condolences to Central News Agency</h3>
<p>[Geneva] The Geneva International Press Association recently sent a cable expressing sympathy and condolences to the Chinese Central News Agency for being bombed by Japanese planes (Central News Agency, 28th, Havas dispatch).</p>

<h3>New British Consul General Phillips Pays a Courtesy Visit to Mayor Yu and Commander Yang Yesterday</h3>
<p>Received at the Municipal Government in Maple Bridge</p>
<p>Following the transfer of Sir Brenan, the British Consul General in Shanghai, back to his country to serve as Assistant Undersecretary at the Foreign Office, Mr. Phillips, the Consul General in Austria, was appointed to fill the vacant Consul General position in Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai last week to take up his new post. It is reported that Mr. Phillips, accompanied by Consul Oakden, paid a visit to Mayor Yu at the Municipal Government in Maple Bridge at 3:00 PM yesterday. Subsequently, he went to meet with Yang Hu, Commander of the Songhu Garrison and concurrently Commander of Martial Law in Shanghai, for his first courtesy visit since taking office. Commander Yang, accompanied by his secretary Sun Lupiing, received him and served champagne. After exchanging pleasantries, they engaged in a half-hour conversation. Commander Yang expressed his hope that the United Kingdom would pay the same close attention to peace in the Far East as it does to issues in Europe and the Mediterranean. Mr. Phillips, upon hearing this, gladly expressed his sympathy, responding that he was willing to deeply cooperate with the Chinese authorities to jointly maintain peace in East Asia. Upon departing, photographs were taken to commemorate the occasion. Mr. Arnold, the Commercial Counselor of the United States, also visited and had a lengthy discussion with Mayor Yu before taking his leave.</p>

<h3>National Salvation Bond Payments Pour In</h3>
<p>Customs Office Continues to Pay Four Million Yuan, Yunnan Remits Fifty Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance yesterday sent four million yuan, the continued payment for National Salvation Bonds, to the National Salvation Bond Promotion Association. It is reported that the Association has collected the funds, bringing the total to five million yuan, including previous payments. The Yunnan branch has also remitted fifty thousand yuan in bond payments, which has been handed over to the Association for collection. The Hubei branch telegraphed the Association that, as of September 25th, it had remitted over 288,000 yuan. According to the Association's announcement, on September 25th alone, it received a total of 3,349,100 yuan from subscriptions and payments from various banks in Shanghai, the Citizen's Corps, the Commercial Corps, the Educational Corps, and overseas Chinese. As various sectors continue to report and remit payments, the amount is expected to increase daily.</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Medicine Trade Association is actively promoting the National Salvation Bonds. Since the organization of teams, with the election of Gao Zhiwen as the team leader, the standing committee members as deputy team leaders, and all committee members as team members, the association has divided the city into three districts: East Shanghai, West Shanghai, and Fahua. The association is actively conducting promotions based on 5% of the operating capital. All colleagues can enthusiastically subscribe, and over 10,000 yuan has been raised.</p>
<h3>Changshu Detains Rice, the People's Food Association Cables the Province for Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Disregarding Government Orders, What Are Their Intentions? Send Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate and Release the Rice and Provide Compensation</p>
<p>The Shanghai People's Food Regulation Association cabled Chairman Chen of Jiangsu Province, requesting an immediate investigation and ordering full compensation because the Changshu County government detained rice boats and confiscated them without permission, defying orders and affecting the Shanghai market. The original cable stated: "To Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, since the outbreak of the war, refugees have gathered, and to regulate the people's food supply, the military and political organs and various legal groups in the city have organized this association to take practical action. Any rice merchants going to the mainland to transport rice are issued certificates by this association to show caution. Unexpectedly, on September [blank] day, rice merchant Shi Zufua, who had a certificate from this association, purchased more than 2,490 shi of white rice in Changshu, which was loaded onto twelve boats by boatmen Bei Jinda and others for transport to Shanghai. While passing through Mochen, the local water police detained the people and goods and sent them to the county jail for custody, and the goods were auctioned off. After the boatmen came to Shanghai and reported to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Jiangsu Grain and Fuel Regulation Office was telegraphed to release them. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Local Association sent consecutive telegrams of proof, all of which were rejected. A cold telegram from the Executive Yuan stated that provinces and counties must not arbitrarily prohibit the flow of food. However, the county magistrate acted wilfully, disregarding national government orders. His intentions are unfathomable. We dare to telegraph Your Excellency, imploring you to immediately send personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, release the boatmen, and return the grain. If it has already been auctioned, please order full compensation to maintain the people's food supply and uphold the law. We are extremely grateful. Respectfully, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai People's Food Regulation Committee."</p>
<h3>Foreign Firms Prepare to Compel Employed Japanese Staff to Pay Wages</h3>
<p>Even for Those Killed or Injured in Battle and to Support Families; Initially Opposed, but Forced to Submit</p>
<p>The Continental Press reports that, according to reliable sources, many Japanese employees hired by foreign firms operating in Japan have recently been drafted into the military, but the Japanese authorities are still forcing these firms to pay their wages as usual. Moreover, in the event of death or injury in battle, the firms are also required to pay support to their families. The various firms initially strongly opposed this, but the Japanese authorities used pressure to force them to submit. It is reported that, with the exception of one or two shipping companies, most firms engaged in import and export trade have now established regulations for the salaries of Japanese employees fighting in China, and plans for family support payments are also being made.</p>
<h3>The Women's Gold Donation Movement Achieves Excellent Results</h3>

It is reported that after 1,000 items have been received, they will be sent to the Bank of China for transfer to the Military Affairs Commission.</p>
<h3>Korean People Have Not Assisted the Enemy in Battle</h3>
<p>Hoping Koreans have absolutely no organized armed groups - Enemy deliberately makes propaganda to alienate Sino-Korean unity - Explanation of the Shanghai Korean People's Representative -</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the newspapers have been reporting for days that because the enemy has been repeatedly defeated by our strong resistance, they have mobilized the famous Korean Kuramoto Artillery Regiment to participate in the war, and that they have conscripted approximately two divisions of volunteer soldiers from Korea and Taiwan to Shanghai to serve as front-line shock troops, and that 80% of the enemy division on the Luodian front is Korean. The people of the Korean National Revolutionary Party in Shanghai are deeply concerned that this news will affect the national feelings of China and Korea, and specifically explain as follows: "The Korean Kuramoto Artillery is not formed by Koreans, but is an enemy army stationed in Korea. The word 'Korean' is only the name of the location. Within the Korean border, except for the running dogs fostered by them, such as police officers and wealthy people with over a million, no Korean is absolutely allowed to carry weapons, and there are absolutely no armies or other armed groups organized by Koreans. This may be propaganda deliberately made by the enemy to alienate the unity and cooperation of the Chinese and Korean peoples."</p>
<h3>Enemy Forcibly Levies Tariffs on Withdrawing Goods from Hongkou Warehouses</h3>
<p>Arbitrarily Orders Supplementary Taxes on Untaxed Goods, Shippers Declare That Negotiations Will Be Conducted Later</p>
<p>In the wharves and warehouses along Yangshupu, various imported goods have been stored for over forty days due to the intense fighting and inability to unload. During the war, the China Merchants Central Warehouse and the North Warehouse suffered the greatest losses, with entire batches of valuable goods being looted, causing damage of approximately 14 million yuan. Other warehouses suffered relatively less. The enemy opened the area for two days on the previous days, allowing customers to withdraw goods from various warehouses in the Hongkou District. However, the enemy seized the opportunity to establish tax collection agencies in Yangshupu. When those withdrawing goods arrived at the warehouse to pick up the goods, if customs duties had not yet been paid when the goods were imported into the warehouse (according to regulations, customs allows customers to pay supplementary taxes and release goods within one year), the enemy immediately levied taxes based on the number and value of the goods being withdrawn. Even if taxes had already been paid at the time of import, they were required to pay them again. The enemy military authorities have appointed Yamamoto, the chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Post Office branch, as the director of tax collection in the Yangshupu area. Foreign businessmen are shocked by this and have reported it to their consuls. Except for a portion who were anxious to withdraw their goods, or were afraid that they would suffer unexpected losses if stored in the warehouse for too long and had no choice but to temporarily pay, and reserved the right to negotiate later, there were also some customers who temporarily stopped withdrawing goods due to the enemy's tax collection.</p>
<h3>The Asia Sound Radio Station Donation Case is Under Thorough Investigation</h3>
<p>Various Agencies are Paying Close Attention to This Case, The Radio Station Sent a Letter Yesterday Correcting</p>
<p>Strict Investigation</p>
<p>The alleged embezzlement case involving donations solicited by the Beile Road Asia Sound Radio Station in Shanghai has drawn serious attention from all parties. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency recently visited Huang Renzhi of the Shanghai Municipal Local Association. According to him, after receiving letters of accusation from the outside world, the association immediately informed the Publicity Committee of the Anti-Enemy Support Association and requested a thorough investigation. At the same time, the association published an inquiry about the radio station in the newspaper. The committee is currently conducting a strict investigation. Other steps will be taken after the investigation is completed. It is regrettable that such shady dealings occurred during this period of resistance against the enemy. However, before the truth is clear, it is not appropriate to express other opinions. The reporter also learned from other sources that the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau are also paying close attention to this case and have dispatched personnel to conduct inquiries separately. As for the question of whether Hua and other two amateur performers are suspected of involvement, the Asia Sound Radio Station claims that all the funds handled were managed by the radio station and have nothing to do with Hua and others. However, during the broadcast, Hua reported in the air that the broadcast was initiated by them, so the Publicity Committee believes that Hua and others' behavior is flashy and inappropriate, and it is also intended to reprimand them as a warning.</p>
<p>Radio Station Correction</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Asia Sound Radio Station yesterday, "Upon seeing the news reports published in your newspaper on September 27th and 28th, we were very shocked. The matter is completely inconsistent with the facts. The vehicle was delivered by the Lianmei Automobile Repair Shop of Shangweiwei, but because the vehicle's parts were not in order, the owner retrieved the vehicle from the shop. This matter can be verified by inquiring with the shop. From August 16th to September 4th, this station broadcasted for donations, raising a total of over 29,000 yuan, all of which were distributed by this station to the Zhonghui Bank, the Local Association, Puwan Villa, Renji Hall, the Red Cross Society, the 20th Wounded Soldier Hospital, the Bank of China, etc. Comfort items were sent to the Local Association, the Anti-Enemy Support Association, the Red Cross Society, the Third Wounded Soldier Hospital, the Red Cross Society, the Twentieth Wounded Soldier Hospital, the Red Cross Society, the Temporary Hospital, the First Refugee Shelter, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Relief Committee, Taihe Hospital, etc. Gold and silver jewelry were delivered to Baocheng Silver Shop and the Anti-Enemy Support Association, etc., all with formal receipts as proof. All of these receipts have now been exchanged with the Broadcasting Industry Association and are now declared to the Local Association and urged to the Social Evening News for correction, fearing that the outside world would not understand the truth. Asia Sound Radio Station, September 28th."</p>
<h3>Westerners Enthusiastically Donate Medicine Kits</h3>
<p>Still Short 80,000 Kits, Hoping for Enthusiastic Purchase and Donation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Comfort Committee is collecting 100,000 emergency medicine kits for the use of soldiers at the front lines. It is reported that the Zhongxi Pharmacy has been entrusted to collect approximately 20,000 kits, and the Committee will issue receipts for each to ensure credibility. Among these 20,000 kits, the most commendable is Mr. Laure, a Western employee of Zheng Guanghe Foreign Firm, who joined forces with the book staff to donate generously and expressed their admiration for our loyal soldiers. They are also willing to widely solicit donations from the expatriate community. Their enthusiasm is deeply admirable. However, there is still a shortage of 80,000 emergency medicine kits. It is hoped that ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life will enthusiastically purchase them from various pharmacies and deliver them to the designated receiving agencies of the Comfort Committee, such as the Four Horse Road Canvas and Cotton Cloth Industry Association, the Guling Road Jingshian Nunnery, the Beijing Road Youlu East Crepe Industry Association, the Yuqiaqing Road Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Local Association in the Zhonghui Building.</p>
<h3>Farewell Party Held by Returned Students from Japan to Students Going to Nanjing</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Association of Returned Students from Japan is holding a farewell party for the students who will be going to Nanjing for training within a few days. The party is scheduled for 1:00 PM today at the Qinghua Alumni Association hall in Jincheng Villa, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hart Road. Discussions on national salvation work, plans, and association affairs will also be held. The notice has already been issued. In addition, the association noted that many students who went to Japan at their own expense did not obtain a study abroad certificate from the Ministry of Education, and the qualifications for such certificates have not been specifically determined by the Ministry. Therefore, representatives were sent to Nanjing a few days ago to request instructions from the Ministry of Education to fulfill the long-cherished wishes of the students. Yesterday, it was learned that a reply had been received from the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, along with a copy of "Measures for the Relief of Students Returning from Japan Without Study Abroad Certificates." A notice was sent to all students yesterday to handle registration procedures in accordance with the measures promulgated by the Ministry.</p>
<h3>Concessions Handle Treason Cases with Caution</h3>
<p>Fearing Enmity and False Accusations, Severe Punishment Will Be Given by the Court for Cases with Evidence</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department is particularly cautious in handling cases of accusations of treason, fearing that law-abiding residents will be falsely accused due to enmity and suffer innocently. It has ordered that all treason cases must first be investigated by the original police station handling the case. The results of the investigation must be submitted to the Chief Inspector's Office for review. If the investigation confirms the evidence, the case will be sent to the court for trial. If no evidence is found, or the evidence is insufficient to prove criminal behavior, two reliable shopkeepers will be asked to provide bail for release without sending them to the court. This measure has already been implemented.</p>
<h3>Recent Activities of the Wartime Drama Troupe</h3>
<p>Since joining the National Salvation Association of the Drama World, the Wartime Drama Troupe of the Shanghai Association of Returned Students from Japan has become even more active as the Eleventh National Salvation Drama Troupe. They perform in two places every day. Although many members are ill due to overwork, they do not slacken their efforts in the slightest. The troupe is currently working hard to write scripts to meet the need. They have completed plays such as "August 13th," "The Death of Yao Ziqing," and "Double Tenth Festival." "August 13th" was first performed on the 25th. The plot is passionate and tragic, and it is quite moving. The others are actively being rehearsed. It is also heard that the troupe is working hard to plan for the upcoming Double Tenth Festival and will celebrate this National Day during the war of resistance with the achievements of their work.</p>
<h3>Education News Roundup</h3>
<p>Guanghua University has scheduled its opening for October 1st at its temporary school building in the Xiqishan Village on Yudingpan Road, Yuyuan Road. New students will be admitted on October 4th and 5th, and registration and review of visiting students will take place on the 6th and 7th. Classes will officially begin on October 11th.</p>
<p>Cun De Elementary School in the French Concession will resume classes on October 1st.</p>
<p>Henan Jiaozuo Institute of Technology enrolled new students in Shanghai this year. The list has already been posted at the association, and the deadline for registration was September 25th. Due to traffic obstructions, it is feared that it will be difficult for all students to arrive at once. The registration date has been extended to October 9th to remedy the taken students and avoid losing school.</p>

<h3>This Morning, Heavy Artillery Fire Shakes the City, Fierce Fighting Breaks Out on the Entire Luodian Front</h3>
<p>Enemy's Fourth General Offensive Seems to Have Been Launched Last Night, Enemy Attacked Three Times on the Luodian Front, Fighting Still Ongoing, Enemy Planes Bombarded Zhabei This Morning, Indiscriminate Bombing</p>
<p>After the enemy's reinforcements arrived in Shanghai one after another, they actively deployed for days. Fierce fighting has been occurring since last night on the entire line from Luodian to Liuhang. The enemy launched a full-scale offensive with naval and land forces. Our troops fought bloody battles, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The enemy's fourth general offensive appears to have been launched. As of this afternoon, our front lines have maintained a superior position. ① On the Luodian front, the enemy's main force repeatedly attacked our positions east and west of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway but were repulsed. The stubborn enemy advanced and retreated repeatedly. This line is still in fierce fighting. ② On the Liuhang front, we are still holding the area near Yong'an Bridge. Enemy planes and artillery concentrated their bombardment, and enemy infantry and cavalry took the opportunity to launch a fierce assault. Our troops fought calmly, killing countless enemies. ③ A large enemy cavalry force concentrated in the central urban area, attempting to use cavalry to assist infantry in attacking our Jiangwan front. Newly arrived enemy cavalry were also very active on other lines. ④ In Zhabei, more than 20 enemy planes bombed our positions along Baoshan Road in batches this morning, dropping dozens of bombs. The rumbling sound was incessant, and some civilian houses caught fire. Our positions were undamaged. In addition, small-unit clashes continued throughout the night. ⑤ On the Pudong front, there was a huge explosion near enemy warships at dawn this morning, startling citizens from their sleep. Soon after, enemy warships incessantly bombarded our Pudong positions with heavy artillery. We also returned fire, and the fierce battle lasted for about an hour before stopping.</p>
<p>(Special Report from this Newspaper) A guest came from Jiading this morning. This gentleman is loyal and enthusiastic and has been serving at the front lines for months. Therefore, he is very familiar with the situation on the front lines. The reporter visited him and received a detailed account, which is slightly as follows, except for confidential matters: ① The Luodian battle is the fiercest. It has not slackened until now, because the enemy is very eager to attack, while our defense is strong. Any weapon is difficult to break through. The enemy fiercely attacks with elite troops, and we defend to the death with large forces, so the focus of the battle has always been on the corner of Luodian. ② In the past three days, the enemy has changed its tactics, changing its course and deepening from the side, as it is not easy to advance from the front. There is a small road north of Luodian leading to Shixianggong Temple, and the enemy is advancing from there. Our side believes that this road is not related to gains or losses, so it lures the enemy to deepen in order to annihilate them in one fell swoop. A month ago, an enemy company entered Shixianggong Temple along this road but could not advance further and was eventually annihilated by our army. Today's move is simply repeating the same mistake. ③ The troops stationed in Luodian are brave and well-trained troops who have reached the end of their rest period, but the loyal and brave soldiers expressed their unwillingness to change defenses, vowing not to retire until they have killed all the enemy bandits. Their spirit of serving the country is tearfully appreciated. ④ Now, the soldiers and civilians at the front have become one, digging trenches and building fortifications day and night, which is admirable. In addition to spending most of their time fighting, the soldiers at the front read newspapers, play chess, talk, and laugh, with a very leisurely attitude. ⑤ All the strong fortifications of the first line of defense have been completed. There is no problem with a protracted war. This is something that can be told to our maritime compatriots.</p>
<h3>Heavy Artillery Fire Shakes the City This Morning</h3>
<p>Residents Throughout the City Are Awakened from Their Dreams, A Small Team of Enemy Soldiers Attempts to Cross the Huangpu River into Pudong</p>
<p>Enemy Shells Land in Fields</p>
<p>After being damaged by one of our explosive devices last month, the enemy flagship Izumo has been repaired and is anchored as usual at the No. 2 pontoon surface, commanding various ships in combat. At about 4:30 this morning, it was again hit by one of our explosive devices, with a loud bang that reverberated through the sky. Buildings and land within a radius of ten miles were shaken, as if by a major earthquake. A portion of the ship's stern was damaged. If there had been no electrical grid to block it, the damage would have been greater and the ship would have sunk. After the ship was damaged, four gunboats approached to protect it, and at the same time, they directed more than ten ships to fire incessantly at our Pudong positions as if to vent their anger. The surface of the river flashed with fire, and the sound of artillery rumbled. Chinese and foreign residents were awakened from their dreams. Our Pudong artillery also returned fire with heavy artillery, fiercely firing at enemy positions in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas. The intensity of the artillery battle was unprecedented since the start of the war. The fierce battle stopped at 6:00 AM. Enemy warships fired a total of more than 200 shells, all of which landed in the fields near ××. A small number of civilian houses were demolished by shells. After the battle stopped, members of the Pudong Tenth Rescue Team set out to rescue people. A total of seven injured men and women were rescued: ① Wang Yuanlang, male, 45 years old, from Chongming, injured in the chest by a bomb; ② Qian Meimei, female, 19 years old, from Changzhou, injured in the head and limbs by a bomb; ③ Wang Guozhang, male, 49 years old, from Taizhou, right foot severed by a bomb; ④ Qian Baolin, female, 14 years old, from Changshu, injured in the head and limbs by a bomb; ⑤ Gu Cailin, male, 16 years old, from Pudong, injured in both arms; ⑥ Lu Xizhen, male, 18 years old, injured in the left foot; ⑦ Cai Guishou, male, 37 years old, from Pudong, injured in the abdomen and both legs, already dead upon arrival. Enemy warships consumed a large number of shells, only killing a small number of innocent civilians as revenge, which is shameless.</p>
<p>Enemy's Small-Scale Attempt to Cross the River Fails</p>
<p>At about 4:00 this morning, a huge explosion occurred in the Huangpu River in Shanghai, shocking the city. Many Shanghai residents were awakened from their dreams. According to inquiries made by reporters from this newspaper, it was learned that an explosive device launched by our country exploded near the enemy flagship Izumo. After the explosion, the Izumo and the No. 1 ship anchored in the Central Wharf turned on their searchlights and searched the surrounding area of the Huangpu River for a long time but found no trace. Enemy warships then began to fire indiscriminately at our Pudong positions, firing aimlessly. Over the course of an hour, hundreds of shells were fired, with roughly one shell being fired every one or two seconds. Our ×× garrison also returned fire. The artillery fire ceased around 7:00 AM. While the enemy troops were firing artillery randomly, they sent two small teams of soldiers in small sampans to attempt to land at the Chunjiang Wharf and the wharf near Lujiazui South. At that time, it was still dark. Our troops waited for them to approach and then opened fire with machine guns. The enemy boats were unable to land and returned to the various ships. The Lujiazui area is mostly occupied by foreign factories and warehouses. Because of the Japanese warships' indiscriminate and aimless firing of artillery, foreign businesses have been hanging flags on the roofs of their factories in front of the Chunzhai Wharf this morning, indicating ownership of their property, in order to prevent the Japanese warships from bombing indiscriminately.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Move in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>At dawn this morning, while the citizens of Shanghai were sleeping soundly, a very fierce explosion suddenly occurred near the enemy warships in Yangshupu, shaking the city. Chinese and foreign citizens were awakened from their dreams, but it quickly subsided. At about 5:00 AM, the enemy warships concentrated heavy artillery and began to bombard Pudong. Our army was not willing to show weakness and immediately launched a fierce artillery battle. The sound of the rumbling could be heard far and wide. In the fierce battle that lasted for about an hour, the enemy fired more than 100 shots, and we also fired dozens of shots in return. One enemy warship was hit by us, and many of the remaining shells fell into the river next to the enemy warships. At this time, the enemy saw that our army's target was accurate, and the enemy warships moved one after another. At about 6:00 AM, the artillery fire gradually ceased.</p>
<h3>The Enemy's Three Fierce Attacks on Luodian Town</h3>
<p>Twice Last Night They Were Painfully Defeated and Driven Back by Our Forces - This Morning They Attacked Again, Resulting in Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>The enemy's fourth general offensive seems to have begun last night. After nightfall yesterday, the enemy launched a fierce attack on our positions south of Luodian Town and east of the Shanghai-Taicang Highway with strong forces. More than ten enemy aircraft were active in the sky, carrying out heavy bombing. More than a hundred artillery pieces concentrated their fire on our positions in the area, covering their infantry advance. Tanks also shielded their advance in the front. Our army had already made full preparations and immediately returned fire with artillery. In addition, our forward sentries fought calmly. Several tanks were destroyed by our artillery fire. Our heroic soldiers jumped out of the trenches and charged at the enemy. The enemy suffered countless casualties, with few survivors. After midnight, the enemy launched a second fierce assault with reinforcements. Our army held its ground and refused to retreat. In the end, the enemy could not withstand it and retreated again. At dawn this morning, the enemy, with undying ambition, launched a third attack, resulting in fierce fighting. The battle is still ongoing this afternoon, and the enemy is showing signs of collapse.</p>
<p>The Enemy in the Northwest Beat a Hasty Retreat</p>
<p>The enemy at Changqiao and Fengzhai, northwest of Luodian, advanced with a small force to harass our positions around Caowangmiao and Pujiamiao at around 2:00 AM this morning (the 29th). Our army initially ignored them, lying in wait in the trenches. The enemy, thinking that our army was unprepared, brazenly attacked. Our army waited until they were close before sweeping them with machine gun fire. The enemy hurriedly tried to escape, in a very disorderly state. Seeing that the enemy had been repulsed, our army continued to defend its position and did not pursue. The enemy did not dare to attack again.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Attempt to Build a Bridge Was Repelled by Our Forces</p>
<p>Since last night (the 28th), the enemy army in the Luodian area used artillery to cover more than a hundred enemy soldiers, carrying a large amount of timber, to the river surface east of Jiangjiazhai, attempting to build a pontoon bridge to attack our position. Our army initially ignored them, waiting for them to begin building the bridge. Then, we used dense artillery fire to aim and bombard them. The enemy could not gain a foothold and retreated resentfully. When our artillery fire stopped slightly, the enemy tried to advance again. Our defending troops, in addition to continuing to bombard with artillery, also fired machine guns across the river. The enemy's attempt completely failed and they have retreated to their original position this morning.</p>
<h3>Enemy Artillery Bombards Shixianggong Temple</h3>
<p>The enemy forces operating in the area from Luodian to Liuhe have been repeatedly repulsed by our army despite numerous attacks. The enemy's intention seems to be particularly focused on our stronghold at Shixianggong Temple. In recent days, the enemy has bombarded it with intense artillery fire, firing no less than five hundred rounds each day. At 9:00 PM last night, the enemy launched an even heavier artillery barrage at our position there. Flashes of fire were seen and the sound reverberated far and wide, only ceasing slightly at around 2:00 AM this morning. However, at around 8:00 AM today (the 29th), six enemy aircraft flew over the area to circle and observe, and directed the enemy artillery to continue firing at our positions. As a result, the sound of artillery resumed. Our garrison immediately fired with anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns. The enemy aircraft rose high into the clouds, seemingly reluctant to leave, and dropped several large bombs. Because their bombing was aimless, our fortifications suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Moving in the City Center</h3>
<p>Dense Gunfire from Forward Contact</p>
<p>At around 10:00 AM this morning (the 29th), a large force of enemy troops was moving busily towards the Tiyuhui Road area in the city center, seemingly intending to attack our Yejiagongyuan, Hejiaxiang, Chih Chih University, etc. The enemy tanks were also unusually active. Soon, forward contact had been made. By noon, the gunfire was becoming denser, and a fierce battle is expected this afternoon.</p>
<h3>More Than Twenty Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombing Baoshan Road</h3>
<p>Afraid of Our Anti-Aircraft Guns, They Dare Not Fly Low - Several Nearby Civilian Houses Hit and Caught Fire</p>
<p>Starting at 7:00 AM this morning, more than twenty enemy aircraft were circling incessantly over Zhabei, taking turns in shifts to bomb the west of the Commercial Press on Baoshan Road in Zhabei, as well as Qiujiang Road and Yokohama, etc. Our anti-aircraft guns immediately fired fiercely at the enemy aircraft. The enemy aircraft dared not fly low and dropped bombs indiscriminately from high altitude, without any target. At around 8:00 AM, the enemy aircraft dropped three flares in the sky as a signal. Enemy warships in the Huangpu River then fired several heavy artillery rounds. Several civilian houses near Baoshan Road were hit and caught fire. The enemy's bombing target seemed to be the Chinese Cultural Center. This morning, in addition to several civilian houses being destroyed, other losses are still being investigated. The bombing stopped at 11:00 AM. It is estimated that sixty or seventy bombs were dropped in total.</p>
<h3>Minor Skirmishes in Zhabei All Night</h3>
<p>Small Groups of Enemy Troops Repeatedly Attack - Street Fighting Along the Railway Line</p>
<p>There were minor skirmishes all night on Baoshan Road in Zhabei last night. Small groups of enemy troops repeatedly attempted to attack, but were all repulsed by our forward ambush troops. Machine guns and small cannons were fired all night. At 6:45 AM this morning, a large number of enemy aircraft flew out from the Yangshupu area. First, one enemy aircraft flew to the sky above Zhabei and circled once, seemingly to test whether we had any anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns, etc. Then, they came in groups of three or four in succession, first taking turns to drop heavy bombs. Then, the enemy artillery from both Yangshupu and the city center attacked in a pincer movement. At the same time, small groups of enemy marine corps east of North Sichuan Road, with ten or more men in each team, crossed Sichuan Road and sneaked into the Chinese Concession. Our army engaged in street fighting with the enemy along the railway line from the Commercial Press printing factory on Baoshan Road and south to Lianzhuli, Tianjili (formerly the North Station Police Sub-bureau) to Qiujiang Road, and north through Yokohama River to the enemy Marine Corps headquarters. Small cannons and machine guns were used to bombard each other. Enemy aircraft also dropped heavy bombs in the sky. By 11:00 AM, the enemy who had sneaked in had disappeared, except for those who were wounded or killed. The enemy aircraft were still dropping bombs.</p>
<h3>The League of Nations Condemns Japanese Bombing of Civilians - The United States Expresses Agreement</h3>
<p>British Boycott of Japanese Goods Movement Sweeps the Country - Trade Unions Plan to Contact Countries Worldwide</p>
<p>[Washington] The League of Nations General Assembly unanimously passed a resolution today, solemnly condemning the Japanese aircraft bombing of undefended Chinese cities. Subsequently, Secretary of State Hull issued a statement to the press, stating, "The United States government has always believed that there is no justification for general bombing in densely populated civilian areas, and that it violates international law and humanitarianism. It has repeatedly explained this view to the Japanese government, and clarified it in a note submitted on the 22nd of this month." He also said that Japan has not yet responded to the note. When asked whether the content of the above statement had been telegraphed to the American observer Harrison on the League of Nations General Assembly's Advisory Committee on Sino-Japanese Issues, and whether he had been instructed to send it to the League of Nations Secretariat, Hull replied that the statement was for the supply of newspapers, and that he had not issued any instructions to Harrison. However, he would be pleased if Harrison voluntarily notified the League of Nations of the content of the statement. In addition, American public opinion has expressed great appreciation for the resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly. Well-informed sources also said that although Secretary of State Hull's policies have been criticized by domestic isolationists, they have now been proven by this resolution. Since the Nyon Agreement was established not long ago, and the League of Nations General Assembly has passed the above resolution again, the prestige of the League of Nations has now been enhanced.

<p>[London] The British boycott of Japanese goods movement is developing rapidly and has now spread throughout the country. Important organizations are actively promoting it. The British Citizens' Union first initiated the printing of signs saying "This store does not sell Japanese goods" and distributed them to stores throughout London. People in various places have automatically responded and requested to cooperate with the Union. The British Central Commercial Salesmen's Union held a meeting in Birmingham City yesterday and passed a resolution advocating that stores implement a boycott of Japanese goods. It is generally believed that if the boycott movement can be effectively supported by commercial salesmen, it will be successful. Therefore, great importance is attached to the Union's resolution. The ministers of various Free Churches in the London area recently held a luncheon meeting and decided to protest "the Japanese aircraft bombing of Chinese cities." They also scheduled a gathering at the Bai Township Church on the 30th of this month to speak out for China. The South Wales Miners' Union passed an important resolution in Zhufu City, stating, "This Union, representing 120,000 members, deeply hates and abhors Japan's military invasion of China and its inhuman and barbaric methods of killing Chinese women and children. Therefore, it requests the National Executive Committee of the General Confederation of Trade Unions to make efforts to contact the International Federation of Trade Unions so that it can notify various countries, especially European countries, the Commonwealth of Australia, the United States, and Canada. Labor groups in various countries must refuse to work on all goods and raw materials that are transported to or imported from Japan, and thereby launch a global boycott of Japanese goods movement until the Japanese army withdraws from China." The Union also copied this resolution to Prime Minister Chamberlain, Foreign Minister Eden, Chinese Ambassador Guo Taiqi, and Japanese Ambassador Yoshida Shigeru. In addition, there are two other interesting things. One is the proposal of the British Sports Association that British athletes refuse to participate in the 1940 Olympic Games when they are held in Japan. The other is that the manager of the London "Black and White Dance Hall," Mike Ye Duoxu, originally planned to order 100 million straws for cold drinks from Japan, and the contract was about to be signed. However, he has now resolutely cancelled it due to his dissatisfaction with Japan's atrocities against China. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] The Labor Party Executive Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting from the 4th to the 9th of next month, at which time it will discuss the Far East situation, especially the atrocities committed by the Japanese army in China, and will discuss and decide to request Congress to reconvene early on the 19th of next month (originally scheduled to reconvene on the 20th) so as to raise questions about the government's diplomatic policy. The atrocities of the Japanese army have aroused strong reactions in British public opinion. This is deeply impressed by the Labor Party members who have come to Beijing from their constituencies. Some members of Congress regret that Britain did not advocate economic sanctions against Japan in Geneva. Generally speaking, the Labor Party will support the domestic boycott of Japanese goods movement, but if employers in various industries refuse to participate in the boycott movement, the Labor Party and trade unions in various industries may not advocate strikes in order to achieve the boycott goal. British law stipulates that workers in various industries may not hold strikes except for matters related to working conditions and the freedom to organize trade unions. Any strike movement of a political nature is regarded as illegitimate, and those who participate in such strikes are not entitled to receive unemployment benefits. Political figures now believe that the Labor Party and trade unions in various industries will only provide spiritual support for the boycott movement, but the Party and the unions have considerable influence, and spiritual support alone is enough to have practical effects.

<h3>No Fierce Fighting on the Jinpu Line Front Last Night</h3>
<p>Both Wings Were Engaged in Hand-to-Hand Combat - Enemy Aircraft Dropped Bombs on Nanlinkou</p>
<p>[Jinan] Today, the enemy is rushing to repair the destroyed tracks south of Fengjiakou Station. Many artillery shells fell near Botou Station. At 6:00 PM, there was no fighting on the front. The right wing was engaged in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy. Our armored car was south of Botou Station, and the station phone was moved to the armored car. The road north of the station has been destroyed by bombing. Enemy aircraft dropped four bombs on Nanlinkou and scouted Huimin and Yangxin. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Jinan] At 8:20 PM, enemies were discovered in more than ten villages seven or eight miles west of Botou Station. Our army concentrated in Nanlinkou. Our left wing is in fierce fighting with the enemy. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Xiao Zhenying Leaves Beijing to Return to Defense</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Xiao Zhenying, the former representative of Song Zheyuan, came to Beijing, and after completing the negotiations on important matters, he left Beijing on the evening of the 28th to return to defense. Song requested a month's sick leave, which has been approved by the Central Government. His duties will be performed by Feng Zhi'an. Liu Ruming is extremely grateful to the Central Government for its leniency in the punishment of demotion and retention. He sent a telegram resolving to rectify his troops and atone for his crimes with meritorious service. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Arrives in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] Chen Jitang arrived in Hong Kong from Europe on the morning of the 28th. He said that after sorting out private affairs, he would enter Beijing. (Special dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Trivial Comments</h3>
<p>— Face</p>
<p>There is a matter that is worthy of study, namely the enemy's establishment of a tax collection agency in the Yangshupu area. According to the enemy, since the establishment of the agency, it has collected customs duties from Japanese ships arriving in Shanghai. However, it only inspects and levies taxes when goods are unloaded ashore, and does not inspect military supplies.</p>
<p>If this is true, then the establishment of the customs is limited to the collection of customs duties on the enemy's goods arriving in Shanghai. But they also said that since the outbreak of the war, Japanese ships arriving in Shanghai have not carried any goods. Then what will the customs collect?</p>
<p>Moreover, their organization is named the Provisional Committee for the Collection of Customs Duties, which means that it is temporary in nature and not permanent. What is collected is the enemy's commodity tax, not the commodity tax of various countries. Even if it is said to be temporary, it must be limited to the period of the war. However, during the war, it was already known that no goods would arrive in Shanghai. Then this agency is almost equivalent to being a formality. If customs duties are collected, and only on Japanese goods, then establishing customs in Shanghai is even "lifting a stone to crush one's own foot," which is completely meaningless. Looking at it this way, there is a big problem here. It is not only of great importance to our country's sovereignty and interests, but also to the great impact on various countries. It is necessary to pay attention to it.</p>

<h3>Three Key Points for the Public Announced by the Propaganda Committee of the Anti-Enemy Association</h3>
<p>Private Audio-Visual Propaganda Tools Should Be Made Public - Encouraging the Public to Build More Air Raid Shelters to Avoid Sacrifices</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday issued three key points to the public, saying that since the outbreak of the war, the people of the whole country have concentrated their efforts on the national salvation movement, and are very concerned about various wartime news. However, because the war zone is expanding day by day, transportation is obstructed everywhere, and Shanghai newspapers can no longer be as fast and widespread as they were in peacetime. Even if they can be reached after many delays, they have lost the timeliness and importance of the news. Therefore, the only effective tool for disseminating news now is the radio. In recent years, many agencies, shops, families, and individuals across the country have radios, but those who do not have radios, do not read newspapers, and cannot read newspapers are ignorant of national affairs and how to save the country, or their knowledge is inaccurate. This is also a defect in the process of resisting the enemy. In order to make up for this defect, we advocate expanding the effectiveness of radios, that is, turning radios used by one person into radios used by many people, and turning radios used by one family into radios used by one area. The same is true for newspapers. All private audio-visual propaganda tools should be made public to the masses, so that the real situation of our army's heroic resistance and the people's sacrifice for the country is deeply imprinted in the minds of the general lower-level masses, and to arouse their ardent patriotic enthusiasm. Only in this way can the effect of national mobilization be achieved. Therefore, it is hoped that the compatriots from all walks of life in all cities and towns across the country will take on the responsibility of leading the people and publicizing to the people, and implement the following methods separately with their own newspapers and radios: (A) For those with radios: (1) When radio stations broadcast wartime news, wartime knowledge, national salvation speeches, and solicit national salvation bonds, move the radio outside or place it in public places, such as teahouses, hotels, bathhouses, barbershops, small vegetable markets, etc., so that the general public has the opportunity to listen. (2) Record the various news and wartime knowledge reported by the radio at any time, compile them into wall newspapers in vernacular, and post them daily in public places or places where pedestrians gather for everyone to see. (3) After hearing the news reported by the radio, immediately call family members and nearby residents, or relatives and friends, and tell them in a sincere manner. If they have any questions, they should also explain them to them accurately. It is necessary to arouse their strong awareness of supporting the government, preventing traitors, sacrificing manpower and financial resources, assisting the national army, and resisting the enemy. (B) For those with newspapers: (1) After reading the newspaper, immediately circle the important news or text that the public should pay attention to with a red pen, and paste the entire sheet in public places, such as taverns, teahouses, and vegetable markets, for the public to read. (2) In the evening or at a certain time, gather village residents, or relatives and friends, and explain in detail the war news, international attitudes, enemy atrocities, the grand situation of people's donations, and knowledge of air defense and anti-poison, etc., to arouse the listeners' spirit of hatred against the enemy and strengthen their will to resist the enemy and save the country. (C) For those with air raid shelters: (1) Modern warfare is three-dimensional, so there is no such thing as a front or rear attack. Therefore, instead of moving the whole family and being displaced, it is better to dig shelters on the spot to prevent air raids. In large villages and towns in the Jiangnan area, wealthy families have air raid shelters. They should be made slightly public. Once enemy aircraft appear, villagers should be gathered into the shelters to avoid danger. (2) Since these air raid shelters do not cost much money, local leaders should widely encourage them to be set up as much as possible to avoid the unjust sacrifices of the people in Guangzhou and Hankou. (3) In a village or town, the village head or school teacher should send people to take turns to watch. Once enemy aircraft are seen, an alarm should be issued so that the public can be prepared early and know where to go to avoid danger. This is easy to do and does not take much effort. It all depends on someone coming forward to lead.</p>
<h3>The Front Needs Rain Gear Due to Continuous Autumn Rain</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rescue Committee Needs Coats, Raincoats, etc.</p>
<p>According to information from the front, the autumn rain has been continuous in recent days. The soldiers on the front line are lying in trenches in the rain due to the lack of raincoats. It is hoped that all sectors will actively donate raincoats and umbrellas to meet the need. These rain gear can be sent to the Shanghai Consolation Committee for transfer.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rescue Committee and various rescue hospitals need a large number of cotton coats for the wounded soldiers, as well as raincoats and blankets for the rescue personnel. It is hoped that all sectors will actively donate. If you would like to donate, please send them to the Committee at 856 Xinzha Road.</p>
<h3>Tao Xingzhi's Arrest Warrant Canceled</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from this city, the arrest warrant for Tao Xingzhi has been canceled by a central government order. Tao was sent to the United Kingdom by government order in June last year to attend the World New Education Conference. He was accompanied by Zhang Pengchun, Cui Zaiyang, and two others. In September, he attended the World Peace Conference held in Belgium. In November, he went to the United States. Soon after arriving in the United States, due to the National Salvation Association case, our government issued an arrest warrant. However, Tao advocated resisting Japan in various countries in the Americas without being obstructed. After the outbreak of the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, domestic friends immediately telegraphed Tao, asking him to take on national diplomacy. Intellectuals, workers, and peasants in the Americas generally expressed sympathy for China's resistance against Japan. Tao played a powerful role. Tao recently returned to New York from Mexico and will soon go to Europe to continue his national diplomacy mission. He may return to China at the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Industry Performs Plays to Raise Funds for Relief</h3>
<p>Starting Today at the Nanjing Grand Theater</p>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Entertainment Industry Salvation Association, in addition to maintaining the work of unemployed people in the entertainment industry, has raised more than 40,000 yuan for national salvation donations, national salvation bonds, consolation items, and wounded soldier hospitals through broadcasting or performing plays. The results are quite good. It is learned that the Association is now raising funds on behalf of the Municipal Relief Committee. Starting today, it will perform "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Nanjing Grand Theater. This play is collectively created by members of the Association, and the performance will definitely win sympathy.</p>
<h3>Two Concessions Form a Committee to Advise on Refugee Issues</h3>
<p>Contributing Opinions and Discussing Handling</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council have jointly formed a committee called the Refugee Problem Advisory Committee. Its task is to contribute opinions to the authorities of the two concessions on the refugee problem in the two concessions, and to discuss with the Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council the necessary steps to be taken in all aspects of handling refugees at any time. However, it does not need to take over the work of any other relief organizations. The committee will work closely with the existing International Joint Refugee Transportation Committee to carry out its work. The chairman of the committee is Mr. Bland, a director of the Municipal Council. The members are Bai Boqian, Yongming Guo, Shunrao Shenfu, Yiping Jiang, W.S. King, and Zhijun Qi.</p>
<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Receives Foreign Correspondents</h3>
<p>The Japanese Air Force is destroying international law, destroying humanitarianism, and bombing our capital and major cities. Public opinion in various countries is unanimously criticizing this. Currently, reporters from European and American newspapers have come to Beijing to observe on the spot. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife took this opportunity to receive them at Lizhi Zhi on the 24th and made important remarks. The picture shows Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife meeting with foreign correspondents.</p>

<h3>Maritime Workers' Union Special Envoy Yang Publishes Open Letter to World's Seafarers</h3>
<p>Refuse to Transport Japanese War Supplies and Goods; Urge All Nations to Impose Strict Sanctions on Japan</p>
<p>Yang Hu, special envoy of the Chinese Seamen's Union, issued an open letter to the world's seafarers regarding the violent Japanese invasion of China, which has lasted nearly two months. Seafarers from all countries have expressed unanimous indignation and support, such as the US seafarers requesting their government to impose economic sanctions on Japan, British seafarers refusing to transport Japanese military supplies, and the International Transport Workers' Federation's telegram opposing the Japanese invasion of China. These are all commonly seen facts. Yesterday, a letter to the world's seafarers was issued regarding the violent Japanese invasion of China, translated into English, French, Russian, Japanese, and other languages, and distributed to various countries around the world by the union members. The text is recorded below:</p>
<p>The world peace that mankind has been praying for day and night has finally been destroyed by the cannons of Japanese imperialism. The all-encompassing flames of war in the Far East are now showing that the future of the world will fall into an unfathomable abyss. If we have not forgotten the tragic fate and lessons of the First World War, we should respond with a resolute attitude to the violent Japanese invasion of China, and find ways to punish them.</p>
<p>The invasions and losses suffered by China from Japan over the years have been evident to all countries in the world. Although we have retreated everywhere to maintain peace, the ambitions of Japanese imperialists have not diminished as a result. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, which they premeditated and manufactured, they have mobilized the national army to seize our Peiping and Tianjin in one fell swoop, and then invade our Chahar and Suiyuan. At the same time, they have launched an offensive against our Shanghai, attempting to realize their dream of a continental policy through an undeclared war.</p>
<p>Those directly harmed are China, of course, but European and American countries also feel a serious threat. Therefore, China's launch of a full-scale war of resistance, although for national survival and self-defense, is actually for the sake of justice and righteousness, not hesitating to make huge sacrifices to strike at this ambitious aggressor who endangers human peace.</p>
<p>Our country's launch of the war of resistance has lasted nearly two months. The general war situation is already well known to people in various countries around the world. The invincible Japanese Imperial Army they boasted of is nothing more than that, and their despicable means and cruel behavior are far beyond their combat capabilities. Their hideous faces are now fully exposed. For example, they brutally kill non-combatants who are engaged in rescue work on the front lines, arbitrarily massacre refugees who cannot escape in time, and dispatch large groups of planes at any time to bomb our capital and major cities in the thirteen provinces in the rear. The most tragic thing is that in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hankou, and other places, Japanese planes actually target refugees and civilians, wantonly throwing bombs, resulting in more than 10,000 deaths. As for destroying cultural and health institutions, disturbing embassies, occupying churches, the rape of elderly women in their fifties, and the beheading of four-year-old children, all of these are done by the Japanese warlords of the so-called civilized country. Their lack of humanity and disregard for justice make them a common enemy of mankind.</p>
<p>However, their tyrannical behavior does not stop there. Recently, they have relied on their large fleet of warships to block our coastal ports, making it impossible for our ships to pass and all seafarers to lose their jobs. They even inspect foreign ships, not hesitating to challenge the world. Their wolfish ambitions are obvious to all.</p>
<p>Regarding this violent Japanese invasion of China, we are deeply grateful for the sympathy of world public opinion. Especially in terms of our fellow seafarers, there were American seafarers who asked their government to impose economic sanctions on violent Japan, British seafarers who would rather go to jail than transport military supplies to Japan, and recently the International Transport Workers' Federation issued a circular to seafarers opposing Japanese aggression. Even Japanese seafarers are brewing strikes to oppose their country's warlords' invasion of China. These facts all show that human hearts are not dead and justice still exists.</p>
<p>Originally, our seafarers live and drift on the vast ocean all year round, and are not limited by nationality. In the swaying of this great era, we should especially join hands in the mutual relationship of the same profession. For the sake of world human peace, unite to overthrow this ambitious and aggressive Japanese imperialist. Our 800,000 seafarers across the country, in addition to using our strength to assist our country in its efforts to fight a protracted war to accelerate the collapse of Japanese imperialism, hope that seafarers from all countries will refuse to transport all Japanese military supplies and goods on the one hand, and promote governments of all countries to impose strict sanctions on violent Japan by effective means on the other hand, so as to avoid falling into the tragic fate of the Second World War. It would be fortunate for the world, fortunate for mankind.</p>

<h3>British Labor Leader Mr. Cattan Discusses His Experience of Enemy Aircraft Attacking the Capital</h3>
<p>If the World Does Not Find a Way to Stop It, It Will Inevitably Be Seen in Europe One Day</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Mr. Cattan, a famous British labor leader and writer, is expected to be elected as a member of the House of Commons for the Luton district. He arrived in China via Siberia two weeks ago to investigate the situation in the Far East, and paid special attention to the Sino-Japanese dispute. He returned to Shanghai from the capital yesterday. During his stay in the capital, he witnessed Japanese aircraft bombing Chinese civilians on a large scale. Mr. Cattan told a reporter from the Continental Daily last night that the disturbance he suffered during his ten days in the capital was unprecedented in his life. On Saturday, Japanese planes attacked six times in a row. The first time, he happened to be in the British Embassy, ​​which did not have sufficient protection. The two small holes dug could only avoid fragments of exploding shells. When the alarm was lifted, he took a car to the appointment with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife. While they were talking, the alarm sounded again, so it was immediately stopped. Afterwards, there were repeated attacks, so he had to stay with Madam Chiang for a long time. Mr. Cattan also severely condemned the Japanese aircraft for destroying the National Health Administration and its affiliated hospital, as well as the nearby Rockefeller Research Institute. After the enemy planes left, Madam Chiang was one of the first to arrive at the scene to inspect the damage. Mr. Cattan praised Madam Chiang and called her the greatest and bravest woman in the world. After returning to Shanghai, Mr. Cattan also witnessed Japanese aircraft bombing the North Station and other places in succession. He said that although the Chinese army in Shanghai only had a few anti-aircraft guns, they were not afraid of Japanese aircraft at all, and their courage was admirable. Finally, Mr. Cattan made an earnest conclusion, saying that what we see in China today, if the world does not find a way to stop Japan, it will inevitably be seen in Europe one day.</p>
