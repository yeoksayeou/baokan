<h3>錯綜矛盾之華北現局面</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>動盪中之華北局面。久為一般人所關慮。張弛程。隨日而異。魚龍曼衍。無態不呈。固已極光怪陸離之能事。而就最近報道之消息觀之。更足以證現實情況之錯綜與矛盾。故－方則有中日長官之往還過從。藉盃酒聯歡之酬酢。示好整以暇之風度。一方則有雙方軍隊之戰門演習。效憑軾寓目之故事。蘊無限肅殺之意味。同時大批日新軍之開抵平津。名為瓜代部隊。而有新增之軍額焉。在鄉軍人實行準戰時之編制。列籍警署。以便必要時之石集馬。而傀儡漢奸輩之汲汲活動。英法租界之緊急戒備。又無在不願示大局暗礁之醖釀。有隨時觸發之可能。如此矛盾。如此錯綜。而謂華北今後不雖入小康之途徑誰實信之。</p>
<p>吾人即國民之立場作廣泛之衡察謂華北情勢巳轉良好固為設想之辭不必存此奢望。認平津一隅形同化外。亦屬自甘暴棄。甚非識者所取。冀察平津。固猶是中華民國版圖內之完整區域也。宋劉秦張輩。固猶是國民政府管轄下之地方當局也。吾人必須以全力鞏同華北領土之完整。以誠意督促地方當局調處之適度。陳覺生一再聲稱。華北情形。並不特殊。且謂冀察當局。年來無時不在委曲求全中謀主權之保持。人心之安定。平心而論。在國交未告正式破裂之前。首當其衝之冀察當局。誠有其不易措置之苦衷。在雙方目光銳注之下。其應付為雖之情形。亦誠有啼笑兩非之感想。然而吾人必須記取。某方之貪心無聲。某方之慾壑難填。得寸可以進尺。獲隴復將望蜀。若以退讓為得計。寗有止境之可言。誠能體察中央既定之方針。確立最大容忍之限度。以明示逾此限度者。卽任何犧牲。有所不惜。如此。庶猶足以自保範疇於萬－乎。</p>
<p>抑又有進者。某方猙獰面目。雖已畢露無遺。要其眞實意嚮所在。亦祇恐嚇脅迫而已。故我愈退縮。彼愈進取。我愈恭順。彼愈恣肆。分化運動之進行。則假手於漢好。走私風氣之助長。則蔽惡於浪人。彼固不恤明白宣稱。以為此若內政問題。我則憚於庇護有人。未敢遽以獨察相加。在此恐恫情勢之下。某方乃得坐收其利。藉令我能祛除恇怯心理。負起糾擿責任。明自認為內政事件。而施行斷然之處置。彼又將以何術自反曩日之信誓。虛聲奪人。其情可見。下犧牲之决心。以威脅報威脅。是則冀察當局應付環境之唯一合理手段也。</p>
<h3>英美兩政府宣布鉅大海軍費</h3>

<p>（東京）政友會代議士蘆田均二日在衆議院預算第四分科會對政府質問、英美最近加強其海軍計劃、日本鑒於此事實、且由海軍國防見地而論、無修正或變更第三次海軍補充計劃之必要乎、海軍省軍務局長豊田對此質問答辯、闡明海軍態度稱、日本以建造主力艦之代艦為主要目的、樹立第三次補充計畫係以倫敦華盛頓兩練約存續之時為基準自主計畫者也、美國海軍計畫、注力於建造主力艦及補助艦、蓋從來美國補助艦之勢力頗小、又英國開始造艦、以計保有巡洋艦七十艘、但英國自軍縮會議當時有此意圖、故英美兩國擬實行其既定計劃、並非積極開始造艦競爭、據一部分人所傳，英國以十五億鎊五年計畫、加強陸海空軍計畫、實有在下次訂立軍縮條約時、企圖獲得有利地步之作用、然英國眞意在乎何處、吾人未敢表示有責任之答辯、總之、日本第三次補充計畫、並無不安之點、故未曾考慮其修正等事、（三日同盟電）</p>

<p>提高購金價格現未考慮、余以為竭力充實現金準備、多存現欵於手中、固屬佳妙、但須考慮將來之通貨制度、至於胡亂提高價值、以購集現金、反有膨脹兌換券之虞、而發生惡劣之影響、實屬不美、余並未慮及無倫若何非多存現欵不呵之主張，故母須勉強以貴價購集現金也、</p>
<p>至於充實在外現欵行使匯兌平衡資金之制度、亦未考慮、此次匯出現欵、亦非根據於多蓄規欵、以作海外之日幣現金、又非以之為所謂平衡資金、完全因國際借貸關係、處於不利之情勢下、據於决算上之考虑耳、（三日同盟電）</p>

<p>繼工黨議員孟特復對於政府方針之“暗昧不明”深致不滿、孟氏認捷克為目前歐洲之尼險點、但倘他國明白英國將出而為捷國援助、此則無人敢起而致之、因此英國切實之聲明卽屬和平之保障、</p>
<p>奧斯丁張伯倫亦為今日主要發言人之一、彼謂各國所需要者、非新會議新條約、而為已有絛約之遵守、奧斯爵士稱　　德國一方面因採取原料之困難而不滿　　但一方面日內瓦所石集以討論接近原料問題之會議、德復不願參加、</p>
<p>艾登答復議員質問之第一點卽為西班牙戰事、稱英政府自始至終、均為不干涉主義之領導者，現經過若干緊張之時期、已獲相當之效果、故政府方面、認不干涉為正直大道、而願繼續循之而行、</p>
<p>艾登對於不干涉委負會主席樸萊茅斯勛爵之忍耐與強毅、大加讀許、並稱現禁止志願兵入西之協定、已經成立、此後西戰影響於世界和平之危機、已可完全避免、彼對於葡萄牙之困難、頗為了解、並重視葡萄國之建議、俾關於監察葡西邊境之英葡協定、得臻於完成而為不干涉委員會所承認彼謂不干涉委員會此後任務、將為如何使各國撤退其巳在西參戰之志願兵云、</p>
<p>艾登繼復對於國聯作有力之辨論，彼不承認國聯已死之說、彼稱、法國與土耳其間亞歷山大萊德爭執之解决、為國聯極大之成功、而此成功、則應婦之於瑞典外長國聯調查員斡施之力云、而事態之不為世界所重視者、實因和解已成、爭端泯除、已不成為重要新聞故也、艾登對於國聯之前途、認為極有希望、但稱所引為遺憾者、卽西歐協定之交涉、迄今尚未能作同樣愉快之報告云、彼等此事交涉中所逢之阻力極多、而西班牙戰手之糾紛，亦屬其中之一、現西戰危險既已減少、政府將再繼續努力、以期於成、彼對於圓桌會議、尚不過英政府所期望之完全解決之初步也、</p>
<p>關於德國要求恢復殖民地問題、艾登複提及上次下院會議中、彼對此問題所發表之言論、卽英政府對於英國政治統治下之領土、既未作移交之談判、亦不作移交之預想、而此政策今猶未敗也、</p>
<p>外相繼複將英國現在對於國聯盟約及重整軍備等所担負之對外責任所站立之地位、加以分析彼效財相張伯倫之口脗、向議會及對黨質問、彼等所不同意於、政府之目標及策略者、究屬何條、請明白指出之、</p>
<p>為避免模稜及疑慮起見、艾登複聲明英國之軍備、在相當時機發生時、可依照條約所規定、用作保護法國及比利時、以抵禦無故之侵略彼復陳明、倘新條約能成立、英國願以同樣之保證、擴大之以及於德國云、</p>
<p>羅卡諾條約之互助、實為其受歡迎之要點於英國民衆之精神、相合無間、</p>
<p>至英國對於國聯盟約之責任、反對黨有謂艾登政策不明確者、彼前此在萊明敦城演說時、曾將對於法比或德國之責任、與對於國蘇之普通責任分別言之、但此並非因政府之圖避免國聯之普通責任、而因國聯盟約之責任、在軍事上、不如羅卡諾責任之效力宏大確切而真實、倘無此等分别、則亦無需乎羅卡诺條約矣、</p>
<p>有谓国聯鹽約之責任、應與罗卡諾條約之實任、同等確切而眞賓、而各国應於事先保证同樣之軍事制裁者但此種束缚、非但将超越國聯盟約之範圍、並將超越前此半途中止之日內瓦議定當之範圍、豈反對黨之意見、願在此國聯荏弱之時、使其東縛超越條約之範圍乎、而最不合邏輯之事、實莫過於一方面担任普遍軍事、一方面又無必需軍備之準備也、</p>
<p>英國政府、無力叮以負担普遍之軍事责任、亦未曾以此重任加諸己身、但英政府擁擭國聯盟約、並以國聯之盟約、為外交政策之基礎、此實英國宣佈重整軍備後、畢世歡騰之理由、蓋舉世均知英國决不違反國聯盟約而作戰也、</p>
<p>艾登復稱、無綸何人對於重整軍備之程序、皆知表示遺憾、但彼所服膺深信者、卽以歐洲及世界之現情而論、英國軍力之擴展、實世界和平之于城云、</p>
<p>艾登複鄭重聲明“吾人並未忘却、軍備係達到目的物之途徑、而非目的物之本身、他日如新機會發生限制之協定成立、吾敢言此種機會、决不任其悄然逝去但现在之途徑、吾由此而達吾人所願達之目的地、亦非不能之事、英政府深信現所循行之針以及現所宣示之責任、賓屬美政府權力內、維持國際和平之最大貢獻”云、（中央社二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）迨會議將終時、工黨議員培克起立發言、謂渠意以為保障安全之道、莫善於大多數國家之間、樹立互相保證之制度，有人以為，英國唯為本身利益計、或為若干國家凡興英國有切實義務為之聯擊者之利益計、始當從事戰爭、茲姑以伊拉克國為例、該國原與英開為同盟國、一旦若果興士耳其國發生戰爭、而土耳其之背後、有德國為之援助、試問英國人民悄願出兵援助伊拉克國、較之援助捷克國、尤為踴躍歟、吾人必不置信也、外務次官克蘭波勛爵、當卽代表政府答稱、統觀各黨議員意見、並不十分參差云云、下議院遂卽散會、（中央社三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>旅歐隨筆</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>十九•西班牙事變的前途</p>
<p>當去年西班牙事變發生後，－般人當時就有一種預感，這一次恐怕要變成世界大戰的導火綫，因為恰恰在一九三六年這麼令人担心的年頭，雖然各國報紙上的論調却告诉人民放心。德•俄•意•三國的報纸各寫其一面倒的文章；英•法•等國的報紙也分為左右兩派，這一邊說，西班牙“人民陣綫”政府立刻可以消滅叛軍。那方面說，佛蘭戈將軍不久就是西班牙的獨裁者。單閱讀一方面的報紙，似乎也可以使你樂觀。可是讀了雙方的報紙以後，那末你反而又糊塗起來。事實上，西班牙的內戰是一個月，兩個月，三個月………一直延長下去，不但兩方面的預言都沒有證實，甚至於，根據一位明瞭四班牙現狀的某國記者觀察，假如沒有意外的變化，內戰起碼還有兩三年。</p>
<p>我們先觀察雙方本身的力量。“人民陣綫”政府方面，雖說得到大多數人民的擁護，但她的隊伍是臨時集合的羣衆，缺乏軍事經驗。所以論數量多過佛蘭戈將軍的軍隊，論戰鬥力却不及佛蘭戈將軍部下正式有訓練的隊伍。恰因為這緣故，雙方才造成了勢均力敵的形勢。不過沒有外來的助力，那末這一塲的戰，似乎也沒有持久的可能。尤其是佛蘭戈將軍方面，不但補充困難，久戰以後還會失去原來的特色。更何况西班牙人民素来對於軍人没有什麽好感。</p>
<p>然而此次西班牙事變是國際間的事件。是一種國際的社會黨人，共產黨人並一部分民主主義者與國際的法西斯蒂黨人的爭鬥。一有了國際的背景，問題就複雜起來。例如最近在馬德里前綫的主力軍，大部分還是外國人。進攻的是摩洛哥土人，德•意•的法西斯蒂黨青年。努力防守的是法•俄•比•德•意•各國的社會黨，共產黨人。西班牙人在西班牙內戰中反而扮演一個次要的角色。</p>
<p>西班牙人這個熱情的南歐民族，在鬥牛場上時常顯出他們勇敢，無畏的精神。當此次內戰爆發後，從軍的不但是男子，甚至於婦女。可是這種不怕死的勇氣仍不能夠使他們變成良好的兵士，因為他們不了解作戰的技術。據英國每日先驅報特派往西班牙戰地的記者報告，他曾與一位前綫的下級軍官作過一次談話，（這位軍官是參加過歐戰的德國社會主義者，西班牙內戰爆發後他自動加入“人民陣綫”政府方面作戰），這位軍官口述他戰敗的原因，並不是佛蘭戈部隊實力雄厚，而是他自己的士兵不懂得戰略，各自為戰的緣故。他說：“西班牙人作戰的精神是很好的。他們不怕死不過指揮起來，你就覺得困難。例如有一次半夜中我下令乘夜向敵人的陣地進攻。當時這是一個十分難得機會。可是這批士兵不聽命令。他們齊聲說：天太黑了，還是明天進攻吧”這麼良好的機會就這樣錯過。您瞧，死他們是不怕的，但怕天黑……</p>
<p>是的，西班牙人不是一個戰爭的民族。他們把戰爭看做是一種遊戲或者是一種運動，最少也同鬥牛一樣。就在戰場上也改換不掉他們那種閒散的態度。大約這也是使這一塲內戰無法立刻解决的一個原因。</p>
<p>自然，西班牙事變的前途，還要看此後國際局面如何發展。西班牙人，他們反而不是最後說話的一個人。</p>
<p>二十•　到底誰的軍械精良</p>
<p>世界上最有忍耐性的人物自然要算外交家。我們只要看幾個月來各國外家在倫敦一面高唱不干涉西班牙內戰的論調，一面却讓本國的軍火志願兵一批一批向西班牙輸送。法•俄•帮助，人民陣綫政府，德•意•幫助佛蘭戈將軍。在馬德里前綫互爭勝負的是法•俄•德•意•各國兵工廠所製造的飛機大砲。這已是一種公開的秘密。我們就在各國外交家互相攻擊對方的文件中，也可以看出一些個中內幕。</p>
<p>德國帮助佛蘭戈將軍的原因，在於担心西班牙社會主儀化以後，更要促成法國的左傾。一個社會主義的隣國，國社黨統治下的德國是不能够坐視的。意大利的目的，希望造成一個法西斯蒂的四班牙作為意大利的同盟國，間接使吉布羅陀港失去了軍事上的意義，然後與英國在地中海上競爭霸權。法國所　懼的，假如一旦“人民陣綫”政府失敗，法國將受德•意•西班牙三個法西斯蒂國家的包圍，根本失去了在歐陸的領袖地位。俄國因為是共產主義的國家，法西斯蒂運動自然是她的死對頭。法•俄•兩國决不肯袖手旁觀而讓佛蘭戈將軍用武力去消滅四班牙的“人民陣綫”政府。於是乎西班牙內戰變成了國際事件。（完未）</p>

<p>最近－週米市回顧</p>
<p>本市米價、自去年冬間逐漸低跌以來、迄至目前、稍見回高、其遠因為去年農產豐收、糧食形成供過於求、近自大結束後、銀根雖鬆動、惟各行商屯戶、在去年年底、已收積甚夥、兼之今春以來、內地米糧大量對外銷售、河米源源而來，市上數量充斥、致供多求少、故銷路沉滯、上週間明盤雖漲、而暗盤仍回跌、近日因受各項物價騰貴影響、米價亦稍形提高、但銷路依然未見起色、販運米船商、什九均告虧蝕云、</p>

<p>本市社會局、於昨日下午二時在八仙橋青年會召集專科以上學校训育主任聯席合议、由潘局长親自蒞會致辭、並讨论重要問題茲分誌如次、計到社會局潘局長、第五科科长</p>
<p>出席人员</p>

<p>主席報告</p>
<p>首由主席蔣科長報台、略謂、社會局對於上海各級學校訓育問題認為非常重要、中學方面上星期業已舉行談話會、大學方面今日邀請各位到此共同商討、使上海各校對於訓育方面能有一比較統一之方法互相促進得益必多希望各位對各校實施訓育困難情形交亙報台、以資參考改進、茲將行政機關對於訓育原則上有幾點希望報告如下、㊀對於訓育方針希望今後偏重於積極的訓導、而減少消極的管理㊁對於訓育工作希望能辦到校長教職員共同負責、使訓與教能夠合一、㊂對於學生思想之領導、希望多多注意其次附帶報告、市黨部社會局為鼓勵優秀學生起見、合辦專科以上學校優秀學生聯誼會希望各校選拔時必須擇智德體各方面成績優良之學生參加云、</p>
<p>局長致辭</p>
<p>次由潘局長致辭略謂、㊀社會局召集之訓育聯席、會、與普通會議不同、定一種談話商討性質、每學期開始、與結束時舉行一次外、必要時亦可臨時召集、手續方面下次預備在會前由社會局先向各校徵集訓育簡單報告及提案、並將提案先分發各校、準備意見、俾在開會時更順利討論、㊁關於訓育主任對學生思想行動之注意、政府希望青年走正當的路、或許因社會環境複雜及反動刊物等種種引誘、使學生一不經意、誤入歧途、訓育的作用、就在使誤入歧途者能回頭如不能回頭而成為全校害羣之馬時、當然予以開除或其他處分、但最好的方法、莫如從積極方面着手、防備學生受不正當路线之引诱、從目前大势看来、情菜或許較過去為好、因共產黨最近表示放弃武装暴動及階級斗争、但其表示是否誠意尚属问题、或许表面如此而實際上仍和过去一樣、則學校方面不能不預先顧慮、最近據報救國會之秘密決議、對於共產黨之表示、不予接受、卽階級鬥爭還是要鼓吹、必要時還是要暴動可證共產黨對於其有關係之團體及份子不能指揮如意、故共產黨上級人員卽使改變方針、而難免其附屬份子仍然不必變所以負學校訓育責任的各位對、於學生之思想行動、還是要時刻留意不能悚懈、否則仍恐有意外事情發生、</p>

<p>最近共產黨又要假借拉丁化漢字、卽所謂新文字運動想宣傳赤化、各位要注意、所謂拉丁化漢字是第三國際東方會議之決議案、表面藉口中國文字難議、故提倡拉丁化、其實際作用、則在宣傳其主義、因漢字之宣傳品易被檢查、而拉丁字之宣傳品可以隱飾、故拉丁化漢字是共產黨宣傳主義之秘密符號、希望各校對於書籍加以總檢查、絕對禁止此項書籍之存在、過去有學生在校中舉辦義務學校、用此種課本教授、其實平民學了拉丁字、毫無用處、因在通用的並非拉丁字、故教授拉丁字之作用、不是為識字便、而是為宣傳共產主義、倘此種文字而成功、則最大的惡果將使中國分裂、因中國之統一最大的力量就是文字之統一、拉丁字以土語拼音、倘各以方言拚音、卽學了拉丁字、還是不能盡懂、將來中國變成歐州一樣、文字統一性完全毀壞、故拉丁化漢字在文化上講也是不應該有的、希望各位嚴予注意、</p>
<p>制服問題</p>
<p>㊂關於軍事管理希望在本學。內第　年能做到學生一律穿制服、此在江浙兩省及南京市已完全做到、上海之所以未能做到、完全是惰性作用、我覺得穿制服小學生或許較有困難、因鄉區小學生家長、有許多的確經濟力不夠、但專科以上學校的學生家長、經濟絕對不成問題、倘學校能下決心、不穿制服的學生不准入校、我想學生就非穿不可了、目前完全是學校方面在顧慮、放松學生、學生自然多所藉口了、同時倘教職員能以身作則、則學生一定更可遵從、至於剃光頭也是如此學校如能強制未有不能辦到者、希望大家下決心、嚴格實施、因穿制孕是軍事管理整齊劃之起碼條件、此事如能做到、其他問題自可迎刃而解了、</p>
<p>討論議案</p>
<p>㊀如何嚴格實施軍事管理促成學生生活軍事化、議決已實施各校加緊推進並求全校普遍化、未實施各校、應於本學定內設法施行、㊁如何實施強迫運動、開運動會時、每學生至少須參加一項、使學生體育發展普遍化、議決、未做到之各校、盡量推進實施、以減少錦標運動、養成普遍運動之風、㊂如何增進學生學識研究及技術練習之團體活動、如國語英語演詳會及辯論會、議決、已有者扶植指導、未成立者設法提倡、㊃如何禁止學生跳舞、議決設法澈底施行軍事管理（如着制服、剃光頭、出入時間有限制）、以為禁止學生跳舞之間接方法、㊄如何使全校學生一律着制服以改變大學生頹唐浪漫之風、議決、第一步先做到校內上課上操必穿制服、教職員開始實行、以身作則、並求與學生家長取得聯絡、俾學生先繳制服費、㊅如何規定學生每學期標準用費與家長合作、實施經濟限制、以改變大學生奢侈浪漫之弊、議決各校盡量採納施行、㊆如何實施就業指導、於畢業前之最後一學期、施以應用知識之訓練、議決、各校除設畢業生職業介紹機關以外、並且盡量設法予以就業技能之指導、㊇臨時動議、本會議以後仍由社會局繼續召集、俾各校訓育主任得以交換討論案、議決、通過、</p>

<h3>匡衡穴壁取光</h3>
<p>— 張秀亞</p>
<p>—因為他小時肯用功所以長大咸為一個大儒—</p>
<p>太陽落下去了，天漸漸的黑了，暮色似－片薄如蟬翼的灰紗，輕輕的掩覆上小河流明媚的眼波，和門前的青翠的山巒。深藍色的天空，像秋日的郊願－樣，綴滿了朵朵的黃花似的小星點。閃閃貶貶，晶瑩得像尖露珠。</p>
<p>瓦簷的稜角慚漸不清晰了……木柵門前，籬笆邊栽耘的那些鮮紅的草茉莉花，在灰暗的暮色裹，也變成暗紫的晚霞色了。漸漸的，花瓣，花葉…都淹沒在夜間黑色的波浪裹，看不清楚了…。</p>
<p>坐在窗前吚吚晤晤讀書的小匡衡，這裹正讀得津津有味呢，書頁上突然像有個人給淌了一片黑墨水，書上那些字變得朦朧模糊了。瞪大了眼睛，也分辨不出那些筆劃了。他掩上了書，皺着眉毛，鼓着小嘴輕輕的嘆息了－聲：</p>
<p>“天黑得怎麼這樣快呢。”說着，便輕輕走到桌邊，翹起脚，㧞长了勃颈去探视那隻錫燈。—看看那燈碗裹乾涸得連一滴油點也沒有了，一根短短的燈草，像一尾離水的魚－樣，乾焦焦的，偃臥在那裹。他怏怏的回過頭來，雙手扶着門框，朝院子裹那棵高大榆樹尖尖望了望！今天是三十，月亮也不會出來了…。他伸着瘦小的手，搔着頭皮道：这怎麽辦呢？今晚连月亮都沒有。…书是讀不成的了：”他垂頭走回屋子裹，坐在桌邊，心裹十分難過。</p>
<p>媽媽走過來，溫愛的親親他的额頭說：“衡儿啊，怎麽的了？是不是唸书唸累了？來，聽媽媽給你講個故事聽吧，講個老虎外婆好不好？：</p>
<p>真叫媽媽無愕了！這個孩子手托着下頦，一聲也不響，只微微搖了搖頭。覆着黑髮的小頭顱低垂着，似心裹有極大的愁事一般。樣子好像比那回他頂喜歡的小花貓鈹狗咬死了還難過。她以為他一定是一天用腦過度感到疲乏了，所以沒有精神說話，便走到炕邊，用手輕輕的敲看炕沿向他道：</p>
<p>“鷄上了架，雀入了窩，日頭沒了不做活。衛兒，天黑了，你到炕上來躺躺休息休息吧，明天早點起來再念吧。這時候黑的什麼都看不見了，你還痴痴的握着那本書做甚麼呢？”</p>
<p>匡衡仍坐在那凳子上兀自發呆，母親的話，他竟完全沒總見。</p>
<p>“嗒，嗒，嗒，…”突然隔壁清晰的傳來有節奏的饗聲。是王婆婆吃完晚飯開始織她的布了。</p>
<p>坐在桌邊呆呆的同個小木偶似的。匡衝，聽了這聲音，高興的跳起來了，拍看手喃喃的歡呼道：</p>
<p>“有了，有了。隔壁王大媽還沒睡覺呢，我借她的燈光來照我讀書吧。”</p>
<p>他像一隻活潑的小白兔似的躥上炕去，攢到他母親懷裹。高興的說：</p>
<p>“媽：我有了主意了…咱那砍柴的斧子呢？”</p>
<p>老婦人聽了這孩子的話，一點也摸不着頭腦，摩着他那一頭軟軟的黑髮道：</p>
<p>“儍孩子，摸着黑你又要什麽把戲？！許多天没有用了我還不知道那斧子和鐘子扔到那裹去了呢。”</p>
<p>他迅速的溜下炕。慌慌張張興沖沖的東摸一把，西抓一把，滿處找斧頭。一會兒把小身子鑽到炕洞子裹去摸索半天一會兒又蹲到屋角柴禾堆邊翻騰一陣。後來在一張跛腳的桌子後面找到斧頭了，他樂得直跳腳。小手攢緊了那沈重的斧頭，照着那面南牆“砰”然是一下子。那黃泥牆應聲生出一道縫紛紛落下許多碎屑來。</p>
<p>他母親不知道他這是做甚麼，慌忙的走上前去，扯住他的破袖口，攔阻他道：“不懂事的衡兒！你這是做甚麼啊！你要拆房嗎？”</p>
<p>這伶俐的小孩子，歪着腦瓜陶气的笑了笑：</p>
<p>“媽！您別担心！一會兒您就明白了，我先瞞着您，不告訴您，悶您一會兒。”</p>
<p>他母親因他平常不是個愛胡鬧的孩子，他這樣做，定有一番道理。便不再千涉他，靜靜的站在一邊，看看他揮斧頭。</p>
<p>砰！砰！砰！他咬着牙齒，又吃力的凿了幾下子。在黑暗中他用小手掌摸了摸，那平坦的牆壁，已經凹了一大塊去了，他又用力的鑿了下去……。</p>
<p>他多高興啊！—那道墙竟呌他鑿了一個小洞了，一點咬黄的燈光，像閃耀在樹梢的－顆火星，透過那道墙垣……。</p>
<p>他微微的笑着，又鑿挖了幾下，那牆竟被他鑿穿了了三寸見方的一個大洞，一道閃亮的燈光，直穿過來，竟像一柄閃亮的金劍。</p>
<p>鄰家的婦人對這小孩子奇異的舉動十分驚詫，從那洞口向他探問道：</p>
<p>衡哥兒，你這是做甚麼呀！”</p>
<p>這小孩子聽了人家的問請，以為人家疑心他是在做挖牆的偷兒勾當，灰白的而孔，頓時紅漲起來，明亮的大眼睛，清炯炯的閃着淚兒，哽咽着說：</p>
<p>“大媽，我沒有錢打油點燈…。我这才挖牆借你的－點燈光…來照着我讀书。…不这樣做，我今晚就不能读書了…我在這小黑屋子裹，沒有方法看清書上的字…。”此刻，他伸出他的小手指累得又疫又疼，他輕輕的揉着那紅腫的手指肚，一陣伤心，不禁撲撲䔩䔩的落下淚來。</p>
<p>那婦人溫和的安慰他道：“你真是個用功的好孩子，不要再難過了，快拿書來唸吧！”　這時候，呆姑在一旁的他的母視，也明白兒子為什麼要鑿穿牆壁了，又是難過，又是歡喜，緊握著他的小手掌，竟一句話也說不出來…。</p>
<p>他從桌子上拿過那本書來，搬過一絛矮小的木凳，臉背着牆，使燈光映照着書頁，輕聲的誦讀起來，這時候，他掛着淚珠的小臉上，竟浮漾起笑容來。</p>
<h3>衛斯汀豪斯空氣制動機發明家George(Westinghouse)</h3>
<p>— 謝德宏</p>
<p>衛斯汀豪斯，以一八四六年九月六日生於紐約的鄉間。他的老子是開製造農具店的，雇了十來個工匠，整日的勞動着。衛氏就在店裹幫着打雜，每天要到了夜分，才得休息。</p>
<p>有一次，他奉了老子的命到波士頓去，當下目擊了下列這樣的一件慘事：</p>
<p>入夜的時候波士頓興紐約間鐵路延錢中一小站的附近，有一輛滿载貨物的馬車在軌上滿跚地走動着，而這匹困頓的瘦马，似乎已不堪驱策了。这时恰巧快車風馳電掣般的開來，雖然一部分行人向着疾駛的火車舉信號，使其卽停，另一部分人幫着去推動貨車，可是好像蜻蜓撼石柱，動也不一動。</p>
<p>卽時貨車和火車相距不過七八十丈，若用人力鎖卷制動機使快車急停，那至少也須相隔二百丈左右，才來得及。照這種看來，停車是萬不呵能的了。說時遲，那時快，一聲轟然巨響，這輛貨車就粉碎了。</p>
<p>衛氏自從親見了這件慘事以後，心中非常難過，企圖發明，一個完全制動機的念頭，便終日盤旋在他的腦海之中</p>
<p>虧他是一個治鐵匠的兒子，叮佔三分便宜，自己能雊鍜鍊鐵器，不必假手他人，於是他就將他計劃所得，從事製造。最初打算利用蒸氧為制動機的動力，可是再三思維，覺得不妥，而除此之外，却又別無良法，就改以極少量的蒸汽起極大制動力的計劃。</p>
<p>有一天，他正在把鐵投進爐中鎔鍊的時候，驀地一個兜賣雜訪的少女向他問道：“先生，買一本去好吧”？衛氏本不想買，但少女接着又央求似的說“我因為缺少學費，故趁假期，賣些雜誌，請先生幫忙”衛氏聽了這話，非常周情於她，就隨便買了一冊，放在一旁。</p>
<p>偉大的事業，往往發端於極微的小事，像牛頓看了一只落下來的蘋果，便闡明了萬有引力的學理；瓦特看見了平淡無奇的熱水因沸騰而掀動，便發明了蒸氣機關一樣。現在我們的衛斯汀豪斯先生，也是成功於無意之中的。</p>
<p>真是無巧不成事，衛氏工作完畢，恰想睡覺的時候，突然想着要看看剛縐買的雜誌。起初也無非愁藉此破破岑寂，不想卻被他發現了這樣的一段肖息：</p>
<p>“瑞士阿爾蒲斯鐵路的開鑿大隧道工程，係用壓榨空氣之力，這在世界，尚屬創舉”。</p>
<p>原來衛氏用盡了腦筋，搜遍了枯腸，但關於壓榨空氣，的確連夢裹也沒有做着過，這次無意中看到了這項消息，其被珍視，也可想而知了。</p>
<p>於是他靜心地設計。一心一意的想把壓榨空氣來運用到他的機械上面。這種無間斷的實驗工作，賡續了三個多月，終於在一八六八年夏，被他將最初的一個空氣制動機製造成功。</p>
<p>這樣的空前大發明，按之常情，應會獲得父母的歡喜和人家的頌揚的、可是事實上我們的衛期汀豪斯先生却不然。他最初非但得不到人家的信仰和榮譽，而且連他的老子也視之淡然，當衛氏勸他老子、將現在的工場改為專製此項新发明利器時，開頭就碰了一鼻子灰。他只得自己募資去辦。他想大規模的發展，和美國最大的鐵公司——紐約中央纖公司的總裁商量。但因為他素來沒有名氣，總裁不肯接見他。後因屢次的訪謁，纔給他一個以五分鐘為限的談話。當下衛氏便陳述他發明品的怎樣組織，怎樣效用，最後又說明了他的來意，可是那總裁却大大的將他譏笑了一頓，便伏案辦公，任你說得唇焦⾆爛，也不理睬。</p>
<p>衛氏雖然這樣一而再的受到挫折，但他自信他的發明確有偉大的效能，他始終不肯灰心，繼續奔波，向各處宣傳。不久，果然獲得了鋼鐵大王卡𣵀基和他友人的贊助，便得實騐的機會。</p>
<p>實騐的時候，火車開足了馬力前進，并招待各鐵路公司的技師和專家參觀，那時是一八六八年的十月，衛氏還祇二十二歲呢！</p>
<p>衛氏對於自己所發明的來西，雖然有充分的信念，但因始終未經一度實騐，心中不免忐忑不安。本來打算在到站時試騐的，不想恰巧有一個農夫推着裝滿了穀類的大車在軌上走。這時，司機的正開足着速率，而兩方的距離，還不及十丈。探首窗外的坐客們心裹都以為這次必出岔子，大家閉緊了眼睛，不忍看這快來的慘變。突然，車身大震，列車驟停，看看前面的大車，離火車頭只有二三丈的路，什麼都沒有毀壞，倒白替它揑了一把汗。原來救了這大車，不是別的，正是應用了空氣制動機的緣故。</p>
<p>這時坐在車上的技師專家們，對於衛氏，不覺佩服得五體投地，挨次和他握手。第二天早上紐約的報上，便用了頭號的鉛字把他和他的發明介紹出來，於是衛氏的聲名，便遠播全世界了。</p>
<p>衛氏既博得了一般人的信任，馬上便籌備創設“衛斯汀豪斯空氣制動機公司。”招股的時候，資金像雨點一樣的飛來，一個大公司，很快便開成了。一八七一年美國制定了全美的火車都要設備空氣制動機的法案。到了這時，驕氣逼人的紐約小央鐵路公司總裁，也只好平心靜氣低頤於科學利器之前了。</p>
<p>出版界</p>
<h3>“遠東雜誌”</h3>
<p>— 則驤</p>
<p>—第一卷第一期</p>
<p>在一九三六年末，我國的雜志界突然躍起了一枝異軍，那就是以嶄新的立場和形慫出現的“遠東雜誌”。這雜志是由寄跡於日本的達東雜誌社出版的。在我們考察牠的內容之前，可以把牠的主旨介紹一下。</p>
<p>在創刊前奏曲裹，牠們編輯人很明顯的宣佈了牠的使命。他們是以還東的國家為對象，加以客觀的研究之後，站在遠東的和平與利益上來發論的。他們主張文化是超越國家的；所以，他們不站在偏重某一國家的立場上，而對遠東的國家，作種種事業上的考察，並且，更具體的說着這樣的話：</p>
<p>“—現今中國要求着對內統一興對外獨立，並保持固有文化之美德，吸收近世西歐文化之优長而融會發扬之……此為中華民國四萬萬五千萬大衆共同的要求輿使命，也就是本刊在任務上應該喚發的事情。”</p>
<p>像遠東雜訪這樣的任務，我們當然不會有什麼異識。這樣以遠東為立場的刊物，當然也是我們遠東民衆所需要閱讀的。</p>
<p>但是，在我門讀了遠東雜誌創刊號之後，便覺得有一點感慨。固然，那些文章是保持着客觀態度，對中國•日本•印度•蘇聯•暹遲等國下了忠實的考察和批評，但是，牠們的作者終竟以隱約的態度，強示着偏重，同情於某一大國的意思。這有我們中國的讀者，無論怎樣，是不能忽祕而加以默認的。</p>
<p>現在，我們來舉出幾節文字，作為我們說話的證據吧。如：言正東的現在之遠東一文，其結論的意識，便有點歪曲的毛病。那結論是這樣的：</p>
<p>“總觀以上所述，可見現在的遠東，動盪的多劇烈！遠東的歷史文化（中國文化和印度文化），全被帝國主義的魔力蕩毀了，印度只剩了一隅的廢墟，中國僅保得垂危的生命，從文物制度上，再也把握不到遠東的精華，顯在眼簾的，唯有強權的角斗。今後，我們應當怎樣去追求新遠東的到來？這是我們遠東人重大唯一的使命。”</p>
<p>上面所抄的文字，其旁邊的圈是我們所加上的；這些地方，就是我們所不能同意的，歪曲現實，偏重於某一國的綸調。再者，作者在這篇文章裹，對日德協定”的觀察，也犯了誇大的弊病。</p>
<p>其次，讓我們再來看看邱尼丘的現在之日本一文。作者在解剖了日本現在的政抬•軍事•外交的情狀之後，便立下了進樣的結論：</p>
<p>“日英向盟的歷史我們該不至於健忘吧—日德在第二次世界大戰的前夜携手了，整個的世界已經被劃分成應戰的兩個集團。現代的日本，她是不懼怕一切戰爭的。大陸政策是否在日德義軍事同盟之下而實現，這是不難想像得到的。”</p>
<p>稍為明白現在國際情勢的讀者，讀了這樣歪曲•誇大•食古宣傳性質的文字，都要表示反對的。所謂日德•日義同盟，不過是西歐的政治丑角法西斯主義者，和遠東沒落，退伍的政治家所造成的，滑稽把戲罷了。在國際政治上，決不會有－點他們自己所希望的效果！所以，我們對於這樣食有毒素的，侮辱中國獨立的文字，不客氣的加以抗議！</p>
<p>其他，現在之中國，現在之印度西文，其結論也不正確。只有現在之蘇聯，現在之暹邏西文，還算差強人意，稍稍適於客觀的態度。</p>
<p>再者，遼有一篇發明論，為抱樂所作。這可說還是一篇比較有價值的文章。作者把發明的意義，方法，步驟等都說得很明白。總之，遠東雜誌創刊號是不能使我們中國讀者滿意的。這是因為：牠的文章並沒有完全依照所謂“客觀的態度”立論的緣故。不過，他們創辦的主旨是可嘉的。我們希望牠的內客，以後應大加改良！</p>
<h3>文化建設三卷五期“統一救國問題特輯”</h3>
<p>— 劉曼</p>
<p>三卷五期的文化建設月刊，是在全國上下一致的統一救國的客觀的要求之下，出了一個“統一救國”特輯。無疑的，牠的意義之重大，是為我們所不可忽視的。因為在統一救國的聲浪下，一方面我們需要客觀地實踐，另一方面在理論上更強調地加以闡釋和檢討，也是我們所需要的。</p>
<p>在這裏，最值得我們注意的，是葉青先生的“統一救國的途徑”一文。在這裹葉青先生把中國的統一的問題，認為是歷史的必然的趨勢。他更把中國需要統一的理由闡明得非常清楚，他說：“中國如果要近代化，須完成統一，要統一才有和平，才能建設，才有民主。中國如果要不滅亡，亦須完成統一，要統一才能集中力量，才沒有內顧之憂，才能對外抗戰完成民族運動，中國如果要把近代化與不滅亡合起來，或用近代化的方法救國，尤須完成統一……。”他除了說明中國的統一必需以外，更具體地提出了實現統一的辦法：</p>
<p>“㊀省府以下任文官者不得兼武贓，任武職者不得兼文官，實行文武分冶。</p>
<p>㊁省府主席，在有割據可能的省區，必須互相對調，不能久留原任。</p>
<p>㊂各省軍隊概改為國軍，防地須時常調動，割據可能的省區的軍隊尤須分調於其他省區。</p>
<p>㊃軍長友其以上之軍官，特別是有割據野心之人，須時時對調，不久任原職。”</p>
<p>葉先生的這些意見，嚴格的說起來，不能說是絕對的完善，但至少是可以供當局參考的。</p>
<p>其次是任一黎先作的“中國的統一問題”，在這裹任先生列舉了破壞統一的三種人，㊀是封建殘餘軍閥：㊁是逆乎歷史的盲動者：㊂是有政治野心的失意官僚政客。據任先生的意見，中國的不統一，都是由於這三種人從中作梗，中國如果要完成統一，只有消減上面這三種惡勢力。</p>
<p>學稼先生折統一運動與中國史太林黨”一文，也是值得我注意的，在這裹，學稼先生把中國史太林黨所掀起的農民運動以破壞中國的統一的荒謬，闡釋得非常透澈。他說：“……現階段的史太林主義者的活動，是一個反歷史的動作。開始他們為破產的農民，而阻礙民族資本主義的發展，後來他們為軍閥的割據，而反對統一……”今日之中國史太林黨的歷史的錯誤，在學稼先生的筆下是赤裸裸的呈露出來了。</p>
<p>其次，是張菲先生的“中國統一與中國話拉丁化”一文，張先生把中國話拉丁化的問題，駁斥得非常嚴厲。至少可以糾正目前主張拉丁化的人的錯誤。</p>
<p>除此以外，在“統一救國問題”的大標題之下，有吳鐵城，黃災培，陳高傭，陶希聖，陶百川，方治……等十馀人，對於統一救國的意見，都發揮得極形詳盡，其中尤以方治先生的（國家統一與民族意識”一文，主張國家的統一，須啟發民族意識，他說：“……欲完成統一的使命，是需要全國民衆共同努力的，所謂“天下與亡，匹夫有責。正是這個意思·因為紙一的形成，就是國民對於國家的向心力的表現……”這確是獨到的見解。</p>
<p>這裹因為篇幅的關係，不能詳盡的說。總之，在這統一救國全國上下一致的要求之下，文化建設的這一期的統一救國特輯，是為我們所應需要而應該加以十二分注意的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>武力侵略與經濟侵略</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>日本林內閣成立的前後，政黨與軍部的磨擦，異常劇烈大有破裂之虞，但是結果政黨方面，鑒於軍部形勢的嚴重，略略表示和緩，所以議會未遭解散，但我觀察任何國家的派別，武力派與文治派的掙扎，武力派必佔勝利，文治派無論理由若何充分，必遭慘敗，此固天演之公例，莫可遁逃者。</p>
<p>自林內閣秉政之初，其對華政策，表面上亦似較為緩進，但是不過一種手段而已，其對於華北方面，仍主武力強佔，其對於其他方面，乃以經濟提攜為號召，其對於我國交涉，主張拋棄總解決，而先用分批解決，從小者易者解決，而后從大者難解決，但其根本的精神，仍不脫廣田之所謂三原則，其所異者，不過面貌的不同，和手腕的不同而已。</p>
<p>蓋侵略政策的慣例，不外二端，一是武力侵略，－是經濟侵略，然經濟侵略必以武力為後盾，而武力政策，亦往往以經濟為前提，故凡處被侵略地位的國家，無論以武力政策來侵略者，必須奮勇抵抗到底，即以經濟政策來侵略者，亦惟以全副精神，極力防衛，故經濟侵略的刻毒，原不減於武力之殘慘也。</p>
<p>故嘗觀察林內閣成立以來，其對華之方針，亦約略可觀，其在關東方面，軍隊拚命增加，在平津方面，軍隊不斷的作大規模的演習，而飛機的偵察，原是到處橫行，毫不受國際慣例的限制，面對於其他方面，則以經濟提攜相號召，而所謂經濟考察團者，一批又一批的來華調查，在此種現象之下，若僅注目於武力的侵略，而忽於經濟的侵略，其敲體吮血之患，決不亞於飛機大砲之慘也。</p>
<p>夫所謂經濟提携者，原以互惠互利為原則，決不是以獨惠獨利為目標，現在彼之所謂經濟提携者，無非如破壞關稅制度，自由實買，與保護走私，或強行開採礦產等等之手段而已，此種舉動，任何巧立名目，主張親善，國人雖愚亦决不願受其玩弄，而作飲酖止渴之舉，此固不待端詳而義無返顧者也。</p>
<p>故前日上海日本商工會議所會長，及三稜鋃行上海支行經理吉田政治，對於中日之經濟關係，發表坦白之意見，謂﹁關於老生常談之經濟合作，此種合作，僅在中國仍在半封建與半殖民地狀况下，及中國仍為原始的農業國家時，始為可能，惟中國近來政治及經濟，已突飛猛進，結果使中國人民，對彼等之運命，有誠摯之感覺，使中日關係，較前惡化，一，此係日本工商界領袖之言，其認識中國的深切，和日本對華政策的不當，可謂畫其忠告之義務，故此種語調，在日人聞之，固當猛省，而我國朝野聞之，尤當痛自覺悟者也。</p>
<h3>從吉卑到芝不棟</h3>
<p>— 李勵文</p>
<p>傍晚時侯，我看到那個村落了！</p>
<p>那時，夜雲已開始在天空彌漫起來，太陽從西邊天腳的雲層裏透出輝彩，用通黃和軟的光輝最後地撫揣着大地，一陣陣歸巢的鳥們聒噪地掠過天空，飛向遠遠處被夜靄迷漫着的叢树林裏去了，……我提着疲憊的步伐，翻過一個小山岡，沿著一條狹隘曲折的小路走進村子裏去。</p>
<p>那是涸居民很少的村落，幾十座“亞搭（註一）房子成一個馬蹄鐵形繞接起來：零落地聳立在村子背後的椰樹，更使村子增長了牠的荒涼。……屋前屋後各處斷續地送出來綿羊的柔弱的呌喚聲。</p>
<p>我從村子那馬蹄鐵形的缺口處走進去，好一些在門口納凉的馬來農人詫異地向我投過來驚奇的眼光……。一家人家正在門口擺開晚餐，我直向那家人家走去……</p>
<p>“斯拉蔑（註二）！”</p>
<p>我用純熟的巽達話向門口一位老人打招呼，放下提着的半舊的皮箱，行了個回教禮。</p>
<p>老人不出聲地詳細地審察着我，……幾個好奇的小孩子圍攏到我身邊來了……好久好久，老人才細聲地慢吞吞地說：</p>
<p>“你大概想在這裏過夜吧？”</p>
<p>“一個老年人想的總不會錯的（馬來成語），老伯，從吉寧到這裹我已經走了六十哩路了。”我說：</p>
<p>從老人眼裏，表現出為難的意思來了。</p>
<p>“我不會拒絕過客人，”老人說：“我也曾做過客人來的，可是……現在，抱歉得很，大叔（註三）荷蘭人下過命令來了。……茜惹———老人大聲喊什麼人，蹲下來一壁咬著烤香蕉，“……現在沒有人再敢留一個客人過夜或者吃一頓飯了……”</p>
<p>“我能夠問這是為了什麼嗎？”</p>
<p>我蹲下來，烤香蕉和熱咖啡的濃烈的香氣幾乎使我的胃翻轉來了，唾沫故意地盡情地湧上口腔來，我覺得彷彿有兩道濕潤的東西掛到嘴角來了。</p>
<p>“這是……”從屋後，一個中年婦人出來了，無言地蹲下來喝着熱咖啡，老人沉吟了一會，繼續着說：“誰知道呢，一個月前荷蘭人下了這個命令，就誰也不敢再留一個客人了。……”</p>
<p>“那麼，……”</p>
<p>我迷茫起來了……眼前忽然浮泛出一幅黑暗無涯的曠野中的夜景：星星在上面閃著凄寂的眼，蛩們在四下里高聲呼喚，儼在為牠們渺小的存在而不平，……我彷徘覺得荒凉的翼羽真的觸着我的心尖了……</p>
<p>“我將在曠野裹过一夜了，”我輕輕地向我自己說—忽然最後一綫希望又希望又在我眼前炫耀起來了，“你不能替我將就一夜嗎？老伯，荷蘭人一定不會知道的。”我說。</p>
<p>老人盛下嚼着的烤香蕉，喝了口熱咖啡，用兩雙被過重的眼皮掩蓋着的眼睛溫和地看着我，迂緩地說：</p>
<p>“在我們，大叔，那是無論怎樣都好的。摩罕默德說：愛敬你的客人像你的兄第，那是很對的。……就是，荷蘭人忽然下命令來了，我們怎好不遵守呢？……：這實在是沒有法子的事，……”我幾乎沒有聽清楚老人的話了，對於安身的問題那樣糾纏了我，我喃喃地幾乎是哀求起來了。人是那樣渴求着“安全”的。</p>
<p>“隨便讓我在什麼角落裹過一夜吧，老伯，那樣荷蘭人一定不會知道的。”</p>
<p>“荷蘭人雖然不知道，可是人家是知這的，”茜惹，那個很瘦黑像被工作磨折壞了的中年婦人，溫和地說“荷蘭人有賞格呢！”……</p>
<p>……老人打開了茜惹的話，训诫似地責備着他溫和地微笑着的妻子：“多嘴！神要責罰你了！—女人家懂得什麼的呢？”老人向四下里看了看，转問着我了：“大叔，我們是什麽都可以的……現在荷蘭人在戒嚴呢！每個村子都在捉革命黨，而且捉的很緊：“老人低聲地沒有表情地噓嘆了口氣，向杯子裏斟了滿滿一杯咖啡：“……留藏客人，也很麻煩的，聽得一些人說，前邊安吉列史村子裏一家人家容留了客人，就一起被關在監獄裹去了呢！……”</p>
<p>老人響聲地喝了口咖啡，久久地在回味着。</p>
<p>我知道已經絕望了，疲憊地站起身，……</p>
<p>“再見，老伯！”我輕輕地說。</p>
<p>黃昏的陽光變得更加淡白起來，遠處原野裏，小土邱上，已低低地罩蓋了一層迷朦的輕了，不知名的夜鳥帶着恐怖意味的偶尔在天空憂然尖呌起来，宣示着人們：黑夜的逼近。</p>
<p>人們原是渴求安全的，為了不能獲得安全，人們却不能不冒險了？……·用一顆無可如何的心情勉強鎮定着自己，我提起脚步走向那逐渐被朦朧的夜靄吞沒着的曠野裏去了。……</p>
<p>注一：亞搭是一種茅草，亞搭房子是用亞搭茅草蓋成的。</p>
<p>註二：斯拉蔑，馬來語，招呼語氣</p>
<p>註三：大叔馬來人稱中國人都叫大叔</p>
<h3>生活</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>天遠沒有亮透，芳姐兒就起身了。她借着那朦朧的曙色，把油垢的鏡台打開來。她輕輕地把挑針從頭變中間挑上去，把它分成兩邊兒，再用梳篷把它梳整了一遍。紙窗上還是一片灰白色，她想想還得再等它二三個鐘頭，於是她雙手托看腮頤，把晚間重復地想了又想的事情又挑逗起來。</p>
<p>她心頭像有無數變小鹿在奔逐一樣地猛跳着。這實在是羞人的事情，何况她自己又是－個閨女呢？在她的面前，猛然出現了一個脫光了衣服的她，站在眾人面前，彎着腰肢，裝作或坐或臥的各色各樣的姿勢，她感到兩類像火一樣的熱，胸頭喘得幾乎透不氣來，這想像使她難堪，她猛然地用雙手緊抱着頭，不斷地搖擺着。</p>
<p>她恍惚瞧見無數雙陌生人的眼睛，像許多利箭－樣射到她身上的各個部分。從娘把她養育大之後，直到現在，她從未這樣地羞恥過，就是下雨天，大雜</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>院里積滿了水，她還不敢把鞋襪褆下來，生怕光着脚给人家看了笑话，现在竟要浑身上下都剥下來，站着給人家看，看了不算，還要给人家掳下來，這怎不羞人呢？她記起那天伴着王天媽到學堂里去的時候，那位校长问她：</p>
<p>“你今年幾歲了？”他走上一步。</p>
<p>“二十歲。”她答，退後了一步。像遇着一個強盜似的。</p>
<p>“瞧一瞧吧！”她永遠不會忘記這一句話。她想起別人說的話來：“洗澡的時候，不准見天，不准見人，大姑娘倘在别人面前光着身子是不貞的，沒有人要。”一種悲苦而又不測人命運的預感襲擊了她，她不覺渾身抖顫起來，眼睛也模糊了。</p>
<p>她想自殺。“這不是跟前門外下處處里的窑姐兒差不多麼？”她的驕矜的心理被摧殘凈盡了。她想哭，但哭不出聲來，爹娘還睡着沒醒呢？猛然間，她又似乎看見娘的臉孔，多蒼黃呵，多麼憔悴呵！</p>
<p>“錢！錢！錢！”這觀念越來越盤擄了她，她喘了一口氣，低聲唸着：“錢呵！全为着錢……錢呵！”</p>
<p>她的爹在後房里咳嗽了。窗外亮了許多。陽光在樹上戰抖着。她隨卽下意識地拿起梳來，把凌亂了的頭髯再理一遍，再搽了些白粉。</p>
<p>等到她要出門的時候，她羞怯地對她的爹娘說：</p>
<p>“娘，爹，我走了！”</p>
<p>“什麼？你還想走？人人有臉，樹樹有皮，你想幹這髒事，不怕爹給人撕了面皮？”</p>
<p>她咽住了，一句話也不回。她爹却氣得冒火，欠起身子，朝她叱着：</p>
<p>“你瞧我年紀大了，作不得活，非靠你不行不是？我寗願賣老命，死不願吃你這碗髒飯。二十歲的大姑娘，在人家跟前光着身子，這眼下處里的窑姐兒有什麼兩樣？我情願餓死，不願看你這不要臉的東西在人家……嘿，”他斷了斷，換口氣。“你今年多大歲數了，多大歲數了？你說，你說！”</p>
<p>她撲到她娘的懷里，哭了起來。眼淚一大串一大串地吊下來。</p>
<p>“我挨你們罵，……給人笑話……為着什麼呢？什麼呢？你們年紀大，作不動事，………錢呢，飯呢？你們還迫着我……我死好了……，”</p>
<p>整個房間里立刻沉靜下來，一個挨受着四面八方的壓迫的無助的女人在悽惻地飲泣着。</p>
<h3>鼠食貓</h3>
<p>— 羅才清</p>
<p>小學教科書上就告訴我們“貓能捕鼠”。上海也有個笑話，某洋行的貨棧裹鼠患甚烈，堆在那裹的貨物常被鼠嚙毀，洋大班因而傳令看貨棧的管門人來詢問，那－下等華人“一見白種人傳問，就嚇出兩句中西合壁的洋涇浜來：“吱吱吱To　much，妙乎妙乎No　got。”以證捕鼠者要養貓。</p>
<p>所謂“貓之食鼠固不足奇。”而浙江臨安之鼠之食貓，寗非咄咄怪事——！那是一日本報上的一則花邊新聞，本地（臨安）多鼠，且體大異當，性不畏貓。據目擊者稱，有數貓竟為其所斃：經過情形，頗覺詫異。據云：羣鼠遇貓後，卽有一鼠，頗似軍隊中之敢死隊然，挺身而上；䆳攖其鋒，旋卽引起羣鼠之注意，立將該貓包圍，殘而斃之。故貓在該地，為數特少云。</p>
<p>因為“鼠之食貓”，大陸報登載之後，再由外論社譯到中國報紙上來，再加以花邊，更是值得注意的事了。現在我們放棄“天方夜譚”式的寓言不談，說是貓與鼠是上帝身畔的什麼，因故降下凡塵，成為生死冤家等等傳說：卽是前幾年的本報畫報上就有貓鼠合影，是一個好奇的白種人費了三年多的長時間，物色了世界上最大膽的鼠和最溫馴的貓，攝得了那樣－張珍貴的傑作。可惜手頭沒有那份畫報，那位外國人的名字記不起來了。不過，這就可以證明臨安“體大異當”之鼠，能夠包圍了貓，“殘而斃之”，也未見得是“咄咄怪事”。</p>
<p>再說，貓似乎不但能夠捕鼠，㸰們常常可以在院子里看見它捕捉麻雀，蝴蝶等小動物，這和人類一樣，肚子里唱起空城計來，是什麼東西都要抓來吃的，祇要是可以吃的東西。貓之捕鼠，和捕捉麻雀，蝴蝶，不過更證明達爾文的“物競天擇，適者生存”已。</p>
<p>既是“物競天擇，適者生存”，於是：“鼠挺身而上，遽攖其鋒，羣鼠立卽將貓包圍，殲而斃之”。以此臨安的鼠的世界，“貓在該地，為數特少”又是當然的理由了。</p>
<p>其他可以舉的例也很多；如議捕螳螂，……等，而說得切身一點，則雄偉如“萬獸之王”的獅子，一睡之後，也會一塊塊的被剝的，這也當做咄咄怪事”嗎？</p>
<p>“鼠能食貓”，睡獅也應該是醒的時候了！</p>

<h3>大光明映「鳳舞銀冰」</h3>
<p>是一九三七年影壇之奇蹟</p>
<p>二十世紀福斯公司，不惜偉大犧牲，特出包銀十五萬金元，請世界著名溜冰舞后宋雅海妮，攝製「鳳舞銀冰」Qnein　a　Million一片。按宋雅海妮，連獲三屆世界運動會溜冰冠軍，溜冰技藝，世無與敵，公司方面，於攝製此片時，除選大批超等名角如亞道夫孟郁，琪恩赫旭，唐阿曼契（「雷夢娜」名片男主角）等外，並請溜冰美女一百名及歌舞滑稽遊藝名角，恊力合演，新奇美妙，爲前此所未見，當該片在紐約最大影院洛杉大戲院公映時，賣座之擁擠，打破五年來的最高紀錄，足證本片之受人歡迎。兹該片定於今日起在大光明大戲院公映，預料又將轟動一時云。</p>
<h3>「生龍活虎」在横山</h3>
<p>因天雨工作停頓</p>
<p>「生龍活虎」去蘇拍取最後一幕軍匪大激戰的塲面，工作幾達一月，本來可早拍竣，因受天氣影響，乍晴乍雨，故工作極感困難，近日又綿雨不止，已完全在停頓中，而滬廠「夢裏乾坤」亟待開拍，攝影收音亦派定擔任「生龍活虎」的攝影收音董克毅何懋剛，因此已快電徐欣夫導演，將董何兩君調回，必要時由周詩穆或王士珍往蘇相助。</p>
<h3>「猪玀」與「雌老虎」</h3>
<p>『十字街頭』中的噱頭</p>
<p>在『十字街頭』中，趙丹與白楊分居在一家只一板相隔的前後樓，趙丹疑爲後樓是那可惡的房東太太的房間，爲報復她常常討房錢那種惡言厲色令人難堪的樣子，每天把香蕉皮花生殻……抛到後樓去，白揚不甘受這種委屈，也就『原璧奉還』。</p>
<p>因爲趙丹是在一家報館工作，每天夜晚出去到翌日天明始可回家，而白揚則是在一家工廠作工，日出晚歸，所以當白天趙丹在家，白揚則不在家，晚間白揚在家，趙丹就不在家，兩個人因此從來没有碰過頭，白楊也不知道前樓是住着什麽人。</p>
<p>有一次，白楊因前樓每天不休止的把髒東西抛過去，忿忿的寫了一張紙條：『你這人太無理取閙，是猪玀』。同時畫一隻猪玀，從隔板隙縫中塞到前樓，趙丹回來看見，也不甘示弱，用紙畫了一隻老虎，上面寫着：『你是雌老虎！』</p>
<h3>「彈性女兒」中路明</h3>
<p>時光如矢般的飛流過去，季節也從暮秋轉變到初冬，像柳絮飄蕩着的雪花，罩滿了一座玉琢銀雕般的新都會舞廳，『彈性女兒』的音樂聲吹奏得非常狂熱，正和飛舞在大地上的雪花同時進行着。這時有一個站在麥格風邊的舞女路明，唱着：『彈性女兒』歌曲的時候，忽然想到自己陷於不能自拔的苦海之中，又眼看着甘願自暴自棄沉迷於狂亂生活中的嚴月閒，被命運與疾病捉弄着的朱秋痕，更聯想到出走的石斧，關在監獄中的余光，何以都得到如此的遭遇，滿腔的哀怨，立刻像曉露般的湧現出來，况且同時又受到債主秦　的威廹，紈袴子弟馬陋芬的譏諷，又想起她與音樂家徐蘇靈當初怎樣的相識，和以後怎樣的别離，一切的一切，都籠罩着她的眼前，使得她傷心極了，她流着淚，甚至於痛哭，然而她的悲哀哭聲，終於被這『彈性女兒』音樂聲壓下去了，新都會舞廳依然被狂歡的氣氛包圍着。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government has decided on the deployment locations for Zhang Xueliang's troops. The first batch, Miao Cheng-liu's troops, left their original defense area on the 3rd and took trains to Henan. The second batch, He Zhu-guo's troops, are also scheduled to head east within this week. The remaining troops will be able to relocate to their newly designated locations within a short period of time. (3rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The Northeast Army, following orders to redeploy to Henan and Anhui provinces, began moving on the 3rd, passing through Zhengzhou from Shaanxi eastward.

This is currently being investigated and handled by myself and Director Mi Chun-lin, hoping that all poor Northeast soldiers and civilians will receive the benefits of the Chairman.

On the 2nd, he submitted his resignation three times before it was approved. A reporter visited Zhang at his private residence, and he made the following statement: "Since I was transferred from the Chairman of Hubei Province to Minister of Foreign Affairs in December of the 24th year [of the Republic], it has been almost one year and three months. At the beginning of my tenure, I was in a situation of internal and external pressure and danger. Although I have been in politics for many years, diplomacy was not my specialty. However, due to the tense situation at the time, personal considerations were not important. Since the government had entrusted me with an important task, I had to do my best in a short period of time. Since taking office, the situation has changed rapidly, and I have done my best, fearing that I would not be up to the task. The implementation of the policies I relied on was all based on the government's established guidelines, and the response to diplomatic techniques was also supported by colleagues inside and outside the country. Therefore, although I bore heavy responsibilities, I was fortunate to avoid failure, which is somewhat gratifying. All major events that have been handled have been repeatedly disclosed, and the documents are all there and can be easily reviewed. Now that it has been more than a year, I have long wanted to relinquish my responsibilities and give way to a more capable person. Now that my repeated resignations have been approved, Mr. Liangchou [Wang Chonghui] has a long-standing reputation and is well-known at home and abroad. His talent and learning are even better than mine. I am very happy that he is succeeding me as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and I congratulate my friend." (3rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Increase in the Number of Japanese Inspection Groups Dispatched to China</h3>
<p>All are Heads of Various Industries　Kenji Kodama Releases Statement</p>

One is Risaburo Toyota, director of Toyota Textile Co., Ltd., and the other was nominated by the Sugar Industry Federation today. All the representatives going to China this time are heads of various Japanese industries, preparing to hold concrete consultations with representatives of various Chinese industries. (Central News Agency dispatch from March 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Kenji Kodama, President of the Japan-China Trade Association, is about to go to China to attend the Sino-Japanese Trade Association conference. A special correspondent from the Central News Agency stationed in Tokyo paid him a visit today, and the interview lasted for an hour and a half. Kodama said with a sincere and earnest attitude that attending the conference in Shanghai this time can be described as "joining hands with the Chinese people." This statement expresses Kodama's heartfelt and deep expectations. When asked about the mission of this trip, Kodama elaborated on his own beliefs and replied, "The purpose of this trip is purely to promote the relationship between China and Japan. We have no malicious intent whatsoever in what we call cooperation or economic cooperation between the people of China and Japan. All those participating in this trip share this belief. However, due to the short duration of our stay in China this time, I fear that there will be no significant results, but perhaps we can open up new avenues to enhance the friendship between the two countries." A brief record of Kodama's conversation with the reporter is as follows: "The Sino-Japanese Trade Association has been formed by leading figures from the industrial and commercial sectors of both China and Japan since the year before last. I am very pleased to have been invited to participate in the first general meeting in Shanghai this time. This time, I am not burdened with an economic mission. The reports in the newspapers are simply not true. Tokyo is a long way from China, and I am overjoyed at the prospect of meeting old acquaintances soon. In the future, I will also take the opportunity to inspect the financial and economic construction of the Chinese government and people. At the same time, I will also be able to frankly exchange opinions with various parties in China on various matters related to China and Japan. I believe this is a fortunate thing. In the past, when I was engaged in international monetary system work, the longest period of time was spent in China and India. Since the death of Shibusawa, I have succeeded him as the President of the Japan-China Trade Association. The association was established in 1920, and all of its members are industrialists directly involved in business with China. Its purpose is to enhance economic relations between the two countries and promote the happiness of the people of both countries, so as to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity. In 1921, when North China was hit by a severe drought, the association collected donations to help the victims. Also, in 1931, when Central China suffered a major flood disaster, the association also worked hard to provide relief. In recent years, many thorny political issues have arisen between China and Japan, which have not yet been clarified. Therefore, the people of the two countries tend to be opposed to each other from time to time. This is what we regret most. It is precisely because all parties believe it is necessary to consolidate the relationship between the two countries that friction often occurs between them in political and economic matters, and there are quite a few people who attempt to use this point to achieve their ideal goals, which makes the situation even more complicated. The two major powers in East Asia should take a broader view and cooperate with each other to ease all kinds of friction and quickly eliminate the current unpleasant state, so as to clarify it and lead it into an area of friendship and stability. This is truly the most urgent task. Regarding the point of economic cooperation, although opinions differ, generally it is sincerely felt that the improvement of friendly relations between China and Japan and the harmony of the people of the two countries are prerequisites. Under the circumstance of opposition, it is extremely difficult to make cooperation proceed smoothly. It goes without saying that the current state of Sino-Japanese relations should not be allowed to continue for long. Only by deepening mutual understanding and cultivating mutual trust can we hope to break through the difficult situation. The various existing political and economic problems between the two countries may still be hampered as before, but I firmly believe that if we can consider the general situation in the spirit mentioned above, there is still a way to solve them." Kodama spoke in a very energetic tone at the conclusion, saying, "In short, we sincerely believe that it is necessary to resolutely respect China's territorial sovereignty in politics and strictly maintain mutual benefit and equality between the two countries in economy. If we follow this principle to improve relations between the two countries, it should not be difficult. We should exert all our efforts with the utmost sincerity to achieve the above-mentioned goals." After completing the conversation, Kodama again spoke freely with the reporters about various issues related to this trip. The reporters, in addition to hoping that he would achieve success on this trip, also expressed their gratitude for his sincere contributions to improving relations between the two countries.

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Complex and Contradictory Situation in North China</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The turbulent situation in North China has long been a concern for the general public. The ebb and flow change daily. The myriad forms are all displayed. It has already reached the height of bizarre and fantastic. Judging from the recently reported news, it is even more sufficient to prove the complexity and contradiction of the real situation. Therefore, on the one hand, there is the exchange between Chinese and Japanese officials, using the conviviality of wine and banquets to show a leisurely and composed demeanor. On the other hand, there are military exercises by the armies of both sides, emulating the story of watching from a carriage, containing an infinite meaning of grimness. At the same time, a large number of Japanese troops have arrived in Beiping and Tianjin, nominally to replace troops, but there is an increase in the number of troops. Veterans are implementing quasi-wartime organization, registering with the police station, so that they can be quickly assembled when necessary. The frantic activities of puppet traitors and the emergency alert in the British and French concessions all indicate that there are hidden reefs in the overall situation, with the possibility of triggering an incident at any time. With such contradictions and such complexity, who would really believe that North China will soon enter a path of peace and prosperity?</p>
<p>We, from the standpoint of the people, make a broad assessment, saying that the situation in North China has turned better is a fanciful remark. There is no need to harbor this extravagant hope. Recognizing that the corner of Pingjin is like a place outside the law is also tantamount to giving up on oneself, which is not what a discerning person would do. Hebei, Chahar, Pingjin are still complete regions within the territory of the Republic of China. Song Zheyuan, Liu Ruming, Qin Dechun, and Zhang Zizhong are still local authorities under the jurisdiction of the National Government. We must do our best to consolidate the integrity of the North China territory and sincerely urge the local authorities to properly mediate. Chen Jue-sheng (Chen Yi) has repeatedly stated that the situation in North China is not special, and that the Hebei-Chahar authorities have been seeking to maintain sovereignty and stabilize the people's hearts by compromising over the years. In all fairness, before diplomatic relations have been formally severed, the Hebei-Chahar authorities, who bear the brunt, truly have the bitterness of difficult arrangements. Under the sharp gaze of both sides, the situation they are dealing with truly evokes both laughter and tears. However, we must remember that a certain party's greed is endless, and a certain party's desires are hard to fill. Getting an inch can lead to seeking a foot, and getting Longxi will lead to wanting Shu. If retreating is considered a good strategy, can there be any limit to it? Being able to understand the central government's established policy and establishing the maximum limit of tolerance to clearly indicate that anyone who exceeds this limit will not hesitate to make any sacrifice, perhaps this is enough to protect the scope of oneself in the event of an emergency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although a certain party's hideous face has been fully revealed, its true intentions are only intimidation and coercion. Therefore, the more we retreat, the more they advance. The more we are respectful, the more they are arrogant. The promotion of the divisive movement is done through the hands of traitors, and the promotion of the smuggling trend is concealed by vagrants. They do not hesitate to openly declare that this is an internal affair, while we are afraid to protect others and dare not immediately add a reprimand. Under this threatening situation, a certain party is able to reap the benefits. If we can remove the fear of cowardice and shoulder the responsibility of criticizing, clearly recognizing that it is an internal affair and implementing decisive measures, what tactics will they use to contradict their previous promises? Intimidation is obvious. The decision to make sacrifices and to threaten with threat is the only rational means for the Hebei-Chahar authorities to cope with the environment.</p>
<h3>British and American Governments Announce Huge Naval Expenditure</h3>
<p>Britain: Over £105 Million; US: $526.55 Million; Japan Maintains Second Supplementary Plan</p>
<p>(London) The Naval Department's budget has been released today, totaling £105,006,000, an increase of £23,776,000 over last year's figure, including several additional budget items. The new ships proposed to be built are as follows: three battleships, two aircraft carriers, five 8,000-ton cruisers, two 5,300-ton cruisers, sixteen destroyers, seven submarines, and forty-five small warships. The increase in ship construction is the largest, amounting to £14,033,215. The reason for such a large increase is not only that the ship construction program far exceeds that of 1936, but also because the funds needed for the entire year of the 1936 program are sufficient. The funds for that year's program are double that of previous years. The maintenance fee for the fleet is set at £9,081,985, which also includes the cost of modernizing capital ships. The number of fleet soldiers will increase by about 11,000, totaling 112,000. The new battleships built will be of the George V type. As the 1936 London Naval Treaty has not been ratified, the warships currently under construction and those planned to be built in the future will comply with the qualitative restrictions stipulated in the treaty. It is heard that the plan to complete the Singapore naval base in the budget has not been modified and is still scheduled to be completed by the end of 1939. (Reuters dispatch from March 3rd via Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) The House Appropriations Committee today passed a $526,555,428 naval supplementary appropriation bill, which is $35,870,282 less than the budget. The largest item cut was the ship construction fee of $27,000,000. Vincent, chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, stated that the committee will accept this cut. The funds won last year actually exceeded what was needed for ship construction. The strike at the New York shipyard and the steel industry boycott caused by the Walsh-Healey Act were the reasons for hindering the ship construction plan. The report passed by the committee today stipulates that 81 warships have been built or will be built, with a cost of $130,000,000, including two battleships, three aircraft carriers, eleven cruisers, forty-eight destroyers, and sixteen submarines. In addition, it also stipulates an aircraft construction fee of $29,186,000, including 251 supplementary aircraft, 104 additional aircraft, 42 naval reserve aircraft, and two airships. The committee predicts that 38 new ships will be commissioned this year, and 29 will be commissioned in July next year. The report also stipulates an increase in the number of naval personnel, which will increase to 105,000 by June next year. (National News Agency dispatch from March 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the 2nd, Yukio Ashida, a member of the Seiyukai Diet, questioned the government at the Fourth Subcommittee of the House of Representatives Budget Committee. In light of the recent strengthening of naval plans by Britain and the United States, and from the perspective of naval defense, is there no need to revise or change the Third Naval Replenishment Plan? Toyoda, Director of the Naval Department's Military Affairs Bureau, responded to this question, clarifying the Navy's attitude, stating that Japan's main purpose is to build replacement ships for capital ships. The establishment of the Third Replenishment Plan is based on the continuation of the London and Washington treaties as a self-determined plan. The US naval plan focuses on building capital ships and auxiliary ships, because the strength of US auxiliary ships has always been quite small. Britain's commencement of shipbuilding aims to maintain 70 cruisers, but Britain had this intention since the Disarmament Conference. Therefore, the planned implementation of the British and American plans is not an active start to a naval arms race. According to some people, Britain has a five-year plan of 1.5 billion pounds to strengthen its army, navy, and air force, which actually aims to gain an advantage in the next treaty for arms reduction. However, we dare not express a responsible answer as to what Britain's true intention is. In short, there is no cause for concern in Japan's Third Replenishment Plan, so we have not considered revising it, etc. (Allied News Agency dispatch from March 3rd)</p>
<p>(New York) News from Tokyo states that Japan is preparing to negotiate naval arms limitation issues with relevant countries. US naval officials recently stated that the progress of this negotiation depends on whether Japan can abandon its demand for equal total naval tonnage. If the country insists that the naval tonnage should be equal to that of Britain and the United States, then there is no room for future naval conferences to proceed.

<h3>Spanish Government Forces Resist Rebel Army</h3>
<p>International Brigade is the Main Force</p>
<p>Madrid - The rebel army today launched a new offensive against the government forces from the southwest, with a front line of 16 miles. The attacking troops mostly used tanks and armored vehicles, and bombarded the government forces' defenses with intense artillery fire. The government forces resisted fiercely. After 12 hours of fierce fighting, although the government forces' outposts were forced to retreat, the main defense line remained unshaken. The main force of the government forces in that area is the Fifth International Brigade. (National News Agency dispatch from March 3rd)</p>
<h3>Naotake Sato Appointed Japanese Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>On Condition of Adopting Policies　Prime Minister Hayashi Asks Obata to Urge</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After directly inquiring about the government's diplomatic policy with Prime Minister Hayashi on the afternoon of the 3rd, Naotake Sato has agreed to take the post of Foreign Minister and decided to hold a ceremony of imperial appointment in the Imperial Palace at 5:00 p.m. today.</p>
<p>Sato, the ambassador to France, met with Prime Minister Hayashi in the Prime Minister's Office in the Diet at 2:20 p.m. today. At that time, Army Minister Sugiyama also joined them, and they had a cordial talk for two hours. As a result, he agreed to take the post of Foreign Minister. Therefore, Prime Minister Hayashi immediately entered the palace at 4:02 p.m. to meet with the Emperor and has been approved. It has been decided that a ceremony of imperial appointment and ceremony will be held at 5:30 p.m. on the same day in the Phoenix Room of the Imperial Palace, appointing Naotake Sato, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, Junior Third Rank, First Class, as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and relieving Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Education Hayashi Senjuro of his concurrent post of Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>Yūkichi Obata visited Ambassador Naotake Sato to France at the Tokyo Club at 9:00 a.m. on the morning of the 3rd as an envoy of Prime Minister Hayashi, conveying Prime Minister Hayashi's intention to invite him to take the post of Foreign Minister. Mr. Sato reserved his reply to this, only answering that even if he takes the post of Foreign Minister, he must directly meet with Prime Minister Hayashi to learn about the government's diplomatic policy and policy before he can answer yes or no. Moreover, he must report to him, so he hopes to meet with Prime Minister Hayashi today. Sato immediately went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to visit Vice Minister Horiuchi to listen to the current diplomatic issues and the government's policy. When Ambassador Sato met with Prime Minister Hayashi today, if his diplomatic policy is adopted by the Prime Minister, he will definitely accept the post.</p>
<p>Ambassador Naotake Sato to France arrived in Tokyo at 9:00 p.m. on the evening of the 2nd and said to reporters, "The purpose of my return to the country this time is to settle the past 31 years of my diplomatic career and, as a citizen, to do my best for the diplomatic community. Prime Minister Hayashi has no reason to object when negotiating with me about taking the post of Foreign Minister, but I cannot decide my final attitude unless I prove my ambitions and management regarding the Foreign Minister to the Prime Minister in advance and understand the diplomatic policy of the Hayashi Cabinet. Although I have lived in foreign countries for many years, I am not familiar with the current situation in Japan, but I know well what Japan's true image is from the outside."

<h3>Philippine Defense Progressing Rapidly</h3>
<p>Maintaining Peace in the Pacific</p>
<p>(Washington) US Military Advisor to the Philippines, General MacArthur, told the Associated Press today that the Philippine national defense plan is progressing extremely rapidly and will be completely successful. As for the main goal of the national defense plan, it is to maintain peace in the Pacific and protect the Philippine coast. If the Philippines can be strong and maintain neutrality, there will be no problem with peace in the Pacific, because the Philippines is located in a strategic location and the Filipinos are committed to peace. For four hundred years, they have never taken any action to invade others. (National News Agency dispatch from March 2nd)</p>
<h3>Prelude to Revival of US Recovery Act</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Submits Message</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently conducted a thorough study of the old Recovery Act and, based on a special committee's recommendations, has submitted it to Congress today with a message. The message stated that this exploration is greatly helpful in deciding on important legislative issues. However, President Roosevelt himself did not propose any specific legislation. Many view President Roosevelt's action today as a preliminary step towards restoring the basic principles of the "Great Experiment," namely the National Recovery Act. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>⊙Pittsburgh Following labor disputes in various US steel mills, the Carnegie Steel Plant in Illinois, the largest branch of US Steel Corporation, recently signed a contract with representatives of Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, recognizing the steelworkers' union led by Lewis as the sole representative for negotiations between workers and management. This move was unexpected, as US steel mill authorities traditionally do not negotiate directly with workers' representatives. Rumors suggest that the change in policy was facilitated by President Roosevelt. Consequently, the steelworkers' plan to declare a strike on April 1st has been averted.

<h3>Japanese Finance Minister Explains Gold Purchase Policy</h3>
<p>and Cash Outflow Strategy</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Yuki explained his views on the gold purchase policy and the cash outflow strategy today at a session of the Third Subcommittee on Budget in the House of Representatives, in response to questions from Tobu and Kanazawa Inayuu, as follows:</p>
<p>There is currently no consideration for raising the gold purchase price. I believe that making efforts to replenish cash reserves and keeping more cash on hand is indeed good. However, the future monetary system must be considered. As for recklessly raising the price to collect cash, it may cause inflation of exchange notes, which would have adverse effects and is not desirable. I am not concerned about the idea that one must store up cash at all costs. Therefore, there is no need to force the collection of cash at high prices.</p>
<p>As for the system of supplementing foreign cash and exercising the exchange equalization fund, it is also not under consideration. This time's cash outflow is not based on accumulating reserves to serve as Japanese yen cash abroad, nor is it to be used as the so-called equalization fund. It is entirely due to the unfavorable international lending and borrowing relationship, based on accounting considerations. (Dispatch from Allied News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Pushkin's Library of 4,000 Volumes</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The great poet Pushkin was very fond of reading, possessing a library of 4,000 volumes, covering all branches of human knowledge, from literary history and theory to natural sciences, law, and statistics. According to those who witnessed Pushkin's death, after being informed of the danger to his life by doctors following his serious injury, he sighed at his books, saying, "Farewell, my friends." Books were indeed Pushkin's good friends. He often forgot to eat and sleep while reading folk tales, political memoirs, and the works of great philosophers. The poet's interests were broad and his mind rich. Only a large number of books could satisfy his thirst for knowledge. Pushkin was fluent in French, English, Italian, and Latin, and could read and translate Spanish and Polish. He even attempted to read Arabic and Hebrew. French books were the most numerous in Pushkin's library, reaching 2,414 volumes. He often read French translations of world literature, such as Shakespeare and Byron. He studied both English and French versions. In addition to studying classical works, such as ancient Greece, Dante, and Cervantes, Pushkin also paid attention to contemporary works. Works by Balzac, Hugo, Stendhal, and Heine were found in Pushkin's library shortly after their publication. Pushkin often left short comments and excerpts in the books he read, which have been passed down to posterity. His notebooks are filled with profound and sharp comments on Shakespeare, Byron, Goethe, Lamartine, Milton, Molière, Mérimée, and others. In Heine's "Travel Pictures," a French translation in Pushkin's library, a piece of paper was inserted with Pushkin's handwriting in French, which is very meaningful. It reads, "The liberation of Europe will come from Russia because Russia has no prejudice against the aristocracy. People elsewhere deeply believe in the aristocratic system, or despise it, or hate it, or try to profit from it. Russia has no such situation. Russia does not believe in the aristocratic system, that's all." Pushkin's marginal notes and excerpts while reading prove the poet's close attention and rich knowledge. Currently, the Soviet Union is restoring the poet's entire library in his last residence in Petersburg, the way the poet had it. The book room is arranged as it was in the poet's lifetime. The bookshelves still surround the red leather sofa where he passed away. At the same time, the Moscow Historical Museum will display Pushkin's bookshelves, with books from the Lenin Public Library placed inside. The cabinets are exactly the same as those in Pushkin's private library. (TASS dispatch, January issue, 1st)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Eden Announces No Change in Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Unwilling to Return Germany's Former Colonies, British Troops Can Protect France, Belgium, and Germany's Security, Hope to Conclude a New Locarno Pact</p>
<p>(London) Following German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop's speech yesterday at the Leipzig city market, Foreign Secretary Eden responded in the House of Commons this afternoon. Many ambassadors from various countries were present in the audience. Eden stated, "The British government does not intend to consider the issue of Germany restoring its former colonies. Undersecretary of State Cranborne made a declaration in the House of Commons some time ago, explaining this view. I have nothing to add. British policy has always been based on this view." He also said that Britain's policy towards Germany has always been constructive. "I made a speech in Leamington last year, saying that if France and Belgium were attacked without provocation, Britain would send troops to assist them. However, if a new treaty can be negotiated in Western Europe in the future, including Germany, Britain would be willing to make the same promise to that country." Regarding the future Locarno Pact, he said that the international situation is complex and complicated, with the Spanish Civil War as an example, which has hindered the negotiations of this pact. Fortunately, the risk of the Spanish Civil War spreading seems to have decreased, so the negotiations of the Locarno Pact can progress gradually. At this moment, Britain is bound by the Covenant of the League of Nations, and its foreign policy will always be based on this Covenant. Referring to the situation in Spain, he said that Britain sincerely hopes that the surveillance plan on the country's land and sea borders can be implemented quickly. Furthermore, the Non-Intervention Committee should recall all volunteers from various countries within Spain. Eden's remarks today were only a response to Ribbentrop's speech, and he did not mention a word about the resolutions of the Italian Fascist Party's Supreme Council yesterday. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the House of Commons rejected the opposition party's motion of censure against the government's foreign policy by a vote of 243 to 134. Lloyd George and Churchill did not follow party convention and participate in the debate, which was unexpected. The debate lasted for a long time. The opposition party blamed the current deterioration of the general situation on the League of Nations' weakness in handling the Sino-Japanese dispute and the Italo-Ethiopian War, and the British government should also bear its share of responsibility. Labour MP Noel Baker said that the Labour Party advocates defending international law by force. If the British government can obtain the support of France, Russia, the Little Entente countries, Belgium, the Netherlands, the Scandinavian countries, Finland, and Poland, it can form an irresistible group. Undersecretary of State Cranborne concluded the debate, saying that today's discussion clearly shows that there are very few differences between the policies of the government and the opposition party, because both sides advocate that British military force should never be used to invade other countries, and both sides support the collective security system. Therefore, Britain's military force should be excessive rather than insufficient. If it is insufficient, you will bear heavy costs and even see war. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Debate in the British House of Commons</h3>
<p>Eden Claims the League of Nations Has a Promising Future, the Crisis of the Spanish Issue Has Passed</p>
<p>(London) Today's debate was opened by Labour MP Greenfell, who said that the backbone of the League of Nations has broken today and fallen into a situation of secret diplomacy and political balance of power, which were condemned after the European War as the origins of European catastrophe. He also said that today, all countries in the world are increasing their armaments due to some undefined and elusive danger, and unprecedented and dangerous propaganda is rampant, diplomatic morality has disappeared, and the military spending of various countries has deeply shocked thinkers. In Europe, Germany's neighbors are all afraid of it and increase their preparations. Greenfell also said that he is one of those dissatisfied with the Allied Powers' attitude towards Germany after the war, so he did not want to make these remarks today. However, he hopes that the Foreign Secretary can have a frank negotiation with Germany under appropriate circumstances, so that he can clearly state whether what he wants is peace, and what kind of peace it is.</p>
<p>Following Labour MP Mont, he expressed his deep dissatisfaction with the government's "ambiguity." Mont believes that Czechoslovakia is currently the most dangerous point in Europe, but if other countries clearly state that Britain will come to Czechoslovakia's aid, no one will dare to attack it. Therefore, Britain's clear statement is a guarantee of peace.</p>
<p>Austin Chamberlain was also one of the main speakers today. He said that what the countries need is not new conferences and new treaties, but the observance of existing treaties. Sir Austin said that Germany is dissatisfied on the one hand due to the difficulty of obtaining raw materials, but on the other hand, Germany refuses to participate in the conference convened in Geneva to discuss the issue of access to raw materials.</p>
<p>Eden replied that the first point of MPs' questions was the Spanish war, saying that the British government has been the leader of the non-intervention policy from beginning to end, and has achieved considerable results after some tense periods. Therefore, the government believes that non-intervention is the right path and is willing to continue to follow it.</p>
<p>Eden greatly praised the patience and strength of Lord Plymouth, chairman of the Non-Intervention Committee, and said that an agreement has been reached to ban volunteers from entering Spain. From then on, the crisis of the Spanish war affecting world peace can be completely avoided. He understands Portugal's difficulties and attaches importance to Portugal's suggestion, so that the British-Portuguese agreement on monitoring the Portuguese-Spanish border can be completed and recognized by the Non-Intervention Committee. He said that the future task of the Non-Intervention Committee will be how to make all countries withdraw their volunteers who have already participated in the war in Spain.</p>
<p>Eden then made a powerful defense of the League of Nations. He does not admit the claim that the League of Nations is dead. He said that the resolution of the dispute between France and Turkey over Alexander Lide is a great success of the League of Nations, and this success should be attributed to the efforts of Swedish Foreign Minister and League of Nations investigator Worsch. The reason why the world does not attach importance to the situation is that the reconciliation has been achieved, the dispute has been eliminated, and it is no longer important news. Eden believes that the League of Nations has a very promising future, but he regrets that the negotiations on the Western European agreement have not been able to report the same pleasant news so far. They have encountered many obstacles in this negotiation, and the dispute of the Spanish war is also one of them. Now that the danger of the Spanish war has been reduced, the government will continue to work hard to achieve it. He believes that the Round Table Conference is only the first step towards a complete solution that the British government hopes for.</p>
<p>Regarding Germany's request to restore its colonies, Eden mentioned again the remarks he made on this issue in the last meeting of the House of Commons, that the British government has neither made negotiations for the transfer of territories under British political rule nor anticipated the transfer, and this policy has not failed today.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then analyzed the position of the British government on its external responsibilities under the Covenant of the League of Nations and the rearmament, and followed the words of Finance Minister Chamberlain and asked the parliament and the opposition party, what are the goals and strategies of the government that they disagree with? Please point them out clearly.</p>
<p>To avoid ambiguity and doubts, Eden reiterated that Britain's armaments can be used to protect France and Belgium from unprovoked aggression in accordance with the provisions of the treaty when an appropriate opportunity arises. He also stated that if a new treaty can be established, Britain is willing to extend the same guarantee to Germany.</p>
<p>The mutual assistance of the Locarno Treaty is the key to its popularity, which is in line with the spirit of the British people.</p>
<p>As for the British responsibility for the Covenant of the League of Nations, the opposition party said that Eden's policy is unclear. He previously separated the responsibility for France, Belgium, or Germany from the general responsibility for the League of Nations in his speech in Leamington. But this is not because the government is trying to avoid the general responsibility of the League of Nations, but because the responsibility of the Covenant of the League of Nations is not as effective, accurate, and real as the responsibility of the Locarno Treaty in military terms. If there is no such distinction, then there is no need for the Locarno Treaty.</p>
<p>Some say that the responsibility of the League of Nations Covenant should be as accurate and genuine as the responsibility of the Locarno Treaty, and all countries should guarantee the same military sanctions in advance. But this kind of constraint will not only exceed the scope of the Covenant of the League of Nations, but also exceed the scope of the Geneva Agreement, which was suspended halfway. Is it the opposition party's opinion that they want to make the League of Nations in this weak state have its constraints beyond the scope of the treaty? And the most illogical thing is nothing more than undertaking universal military responsibilities on the one hand, and having no necessary military preparations on the other hand.</p>
<p>The British government is unable to bear universal military responsibilities, nor has it placed this heavy task on itself. But the British government embraces the Covenant of the League of Nations and takes the Covenant of the League of Nations as the basis of its foreign policy. This is the reason why Britain celebrated the rearmament after it announced it. It is known to the world that Britain will never violate the Covenant of the League of Nations and go to war.</p>
<p>Eden reiterated that whoever regrets the process of rearmament, he believes deeply that in the current situation in Europe and the world, the expansion of British military power is the foundation of world peace.</p>
<p>Eden solemnly stated, "We have not forgotten that armaments are the means to achieve the goal, not the goal itself. If a new opportunity arises for the establishment of a restrictive agreement in the future, I dare say that this opportunity will never be allowed to pass quietly. But the current path, I can reach the destination we want to reach through this path. The British government deeply believes that the needle it is currently following and the responsibilities it has declared are within the power of the US government and are the greatest contribution to maintaining international peace." (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) At the end of the meeting, Labour MP Baker stood up and said that he believes that the best way to ensure security is to establish a system of mutual guarantees between the majority of countries. Some people think that Britain should only engage in war for its own interests or for the interests of some countries that have a real obligation to form a coalition with Britain. Now, take Iraq as an example. The country was originally an ally of Britain. Once a war breaks out with Turkey, and Germany is behind Turkey's aid, would the British people be more willing to send troops to aid Iraq than to aid Czechoslovakia? We must not believe it. Undersecretary of State Cranborne immediately replied on behalf of the government that the opinions of the members of each party are not very different. The House of Commons then adjourned.

<h3>US Discovers German Secret Debt</h3>
<p>US$200 Million, Used for Rearmament, etc.</p>
<p>(New York) The Securities and Exchange Commission announced today that it has discovered a so-called secret debt of about US$200 million, which is used for Germany's rearmament and employment of the unemployed. This matter was discovered by registering a kind of German government-issued bond, totaling 69 million yuan, to pay for the German interest and repayment of debts. According to normal practice, the committee applied for Germany to explain the total amount of its current debt. Although Germany did not deny the existence of this secret debt, it refused to explain its content because it was not a government debt. The committee does not want to discriminate against the registration of the 69 million yuan loan, but said that the unregistered debts must be publicly announced in detail, including the construction of motorways and rearmament expenses.

<h3>UK Reduces Steel Tariffs</h3>
<p>To Facilitate Manufacturing Armaments</p>
<p>(London) Since the government implemented the armaments expansion plan, the two raw materials of steel have gradually become scarce due to the sharp increase in demand. The government issued an order yesterday to revise some of the import tariffs on the two raw materials of steel and its products, or reduce the tax rate, or exempt them directly, depending on the needs. For example, the import tax rate on pig iron was originally 33.33%, which has now been exempted. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>South African Federal Ordnance Factory</h3>
<p>Cooperation with British Chemical Plant</p>
<p>(London) South African Federal Defense Minister Piro notified the Federal Parliament that the South African government and Imperial Chemical Industries Limited have signed a contract to build an ordnance factory in Pretoria. The Federal government has established a bureau to manage the procurement and manufacturing of munitions. (National Electric, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Italy Decides to Form Childbearing Front</h3>
<p>To Serve as Soldiers and Take On Colonization</p>
<p>(Rome) The Fascist Supreme Council will hold a meeting tonight to discuss measures to curb the continued decline in Italy's population productivity and develop a so-called "childbearing front" for future recruitment of soldiers and immigration. Prime Minister Mussolini will attend the meeting as chairman. Since 1926, the authorities have allocated 1 million Italian lire to finance the Fascist Party's campaign to encourage births. However, the population birth rate has decreased from 29% in 1921 to 22.2% last year. The government may now implement a system of discriminating against unmarried people and married people without children in seeking employment, or it may greatly increase the bachelor tax paid by unmarried people. It is believed that if the Italian birth rate continues to decline, it will be difficult to carry out the colonization of Abyssinia, and the number of soldiers defending the new empire will decrease. It is believed that in the next few years, Abyssinia must have 5 million Italian people to ensure its safety. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Schools Teach Military Science</h3>
<p>Professors Teach Children Tactics</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government recently promulgated a new law, stipulating that military science and strategy courses should be added to the curriculum of all schools in the country from now on, teaching children over the age of eight. Miniature bullets, gas masks, guns, parachutes, airplanes, etc. will be manufactured to serve as teaching materials for each school. It will immediately order teachers of each school to encourage students to do various sports that can practice the military courses taught. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3>German Scientists Invent Artificial Rubber</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German scientists have recently invented an artificial rubber, called "Buna," whose function is the same as natural rubber. Some industrialists have recently raised 30 million marks to organize a company to manufacture this product. It is expected that it will be shipped in 1938. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to well-informed sources here, the German Dyestuffs Trust is building two factories in central Germany, which will begin large-scale rubber manufacturing in January next year. The factory is operated by Buna Co., Ltd., which has a share capital of 30 million Kreio, most of which is owned by the German Dyestuffs Trust. The company holds the exclusive rights to manufacture rubber under the Buna method, and the patent for the Buna method belongs to the German Dyestuffs Trust. It is believed that the factory can produce 2,000 tons of rubber per month, which is 30% of Germany's monthly rubber consumption. (National Electric, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Liu Lu Yin, Arrested in the Yang Yongtai Case, Immediately Escorted to E Province for Trial</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Accomplices and Suspects Are All Detained in E Province, Military Headquarters Chief He Chengjun Personally Interrogated Twice, After Liu's Extradition to E Province, the Trial Will Open in the High Court</p>
<p>Wuchang Correspondence: The assassination of Yang Yongtai, Chairman of the E Province Government, which shocked the nation, led to the arrest of the perpetrator, Cheng Xiechao, on the spot, and the gradual acquisition of clues. Over the past few months, accomplices and suspects have been successively arrested, and important evidence has been seized. Cheng and others are still detained in E Province. Liu Luyin, who was arrested in Shanghai, will also be escorted to E Province for trial. The cracking of this case, with its tortuous circumstances, has not been publicly disclosed in detail for a long time due to the ongoing investigation. Now that all the perpetrators in the case have been apprehended, there is no need for secrecy. Therefore, a supplementary account of the process is provided to inform the public. On the day of the state funeral of the late Chairman Hu last year, Yang Yongtai, Chairman of the E Province Government, went to Hankou from Wuchang at the invitation of the U.S. Consul. After completing his official duties, he returned to Wuchang with his wife across the Yangtze River. Due to the heavy wind and waves, the chartered steamer could not operate, so they changed to the Wuhan ferry at the Jianghan Customs Wharf. Just as they got out of the car, they were ambushed, and he died shortly after at the Tongren Hospital. The assassin, Cheng Xiechao, was apprehended on the spot by the police. His statements at the Public Security Bureau were contradictory and elusive. Due to the complex nature of the case, the authorities organized a joint trial committee, with Liu Shoupeng as the presiding judge. Subsequently, they apprehended key figures on the spot, such as Gu Yifan, Luo Jingning, and Wen Maogong, which began to reveal the entire story. On February 8th of this year, accomplices and suspects, including Long Bozhou, Cai Decheng, Yang Qixin, Huang Zhenglin, Wang Guangzong, Yang Xiangmin, Yu Jianzhong, Xiao Ruoxu, Li Qunjian, Li Guozhong, He Yunqing, and a female suspect, were extradited from Beijing and Shanghai. Among them were two university professors and a senior official from a certain institution. The Wuhan Military Headquarters held hearings on February 10th and 12th, personally presided over by Director He Chengjun and Liu Shoupeng, the Chief of the Military Law Department. It was determined that Liu Luyin was the mastermind. Subsequently, important evidence was obtained in Hong Kong, including the assassination plans of the so-called "Revolutionary Corps" and "China Youth Special Task Force." Important party and state figures such as Zhang Qun and Yu Feipeng were among those plotted for assassination. There was also a note indicating Liu's instructions to his followers, stating, "Since it is difficult to operate in Shanghai, efforts can be focused on Beijing and E Province." Liu's signature was on the note. The authorities considered this irrefutable evidence and arrested him in Shanghai on the 24th. Thus, all the perpetrators in the case were completely apprehended. It was discovered that the "Revolutionary Corps and China Youth Special Task Force" organized by Liu was a highly secret organization, seemingly linked to Wang Yaqiao and the "Ax Gang." They used money to recruit followers, spreading them across Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, E Province, and Jiangxi, with the sole purpose of assassinating important figures. After the successful assassination of Tang Youren, they became even more active. It is said that members were required to monitor each other's actions, and anyone who surrendered or informed would have their entire family suffer a cruel fate. Therefore, this secret was known to no one. Now, thanks to the arrest of Cheng Xiechao in the Yang case, the truth has been revealed, like a willow branch revealing the arrival of spring. Cheng used many aliases, but his real name is Tan Wenxin. He is from Guizhou, not Sichuan. He served as a low-ranking officer in a certain unit. He is simple-minded and quick-tempered. Currently, he is being held in solitary confinement in prison, constantly causing trouble and assaulting prison guards, so he has been put in shackles and handcuffs. There are rumors that he will be executed in Hankou. The other perpetrators are held in a certain prison, and the female suspect is kept separately, all treated very well. No torture was used during the interrogation. One of the perpetrators, Gong Bozhou, was originally one of the assassins on the spot during the Yang assassination. He took the opportunity to escape and secretly went to Shanghai. When Gong was in Hankou, he frequented a prostitute named Lao San in the French Concession. This was discovered by detectives here, who found her and took her with them to Shanghai to identify and arrest him. However, Gong had already gone to Beijing. They followed him to Beijing, but Gong had gone to Anhui. Finally, he was captured in Wuhu, demonstrating the efforts of the detectives in this case. Xiao Ruoxu was arrested at Yang Erqian's residence in Shanghai. It is said that he is not significantly involved in the case and is only a witness. Currently, Liu Shoupeng, the Chief of the Military Law Department of the Military Headquarters, has gone to Beijing to meet with high-ranking officials, report on the progress of the trial, and request instructions. The central authorities believe that since all the perpetrators are detained in E Province, it would be convenient to escort the mastermind, Liu Luyin, to E Province for trial. He will be escorted to E Province for trial after being extradited from Shanghai. Furthermore, since this case does not entirely fall within the scope of military law, it will be tried by the Hubei Higher Court. It is said that the organizing agency has dispatched personnel to Shanghai to await and escort him, and is also preparing a detention facility for Liu to show him preferential treatment.

<h3>Random Notes from Europe</h3>
<p>— Our Newspaper's Correspondent in Europe, Lieshan</p>
<p>19. The Future of the Spanish Incident</p>
<p>When the Spanish incident occurred last year, there was a general feeling that it might become the fuse for a world war because it happened in the worrisome year of 1936. Although the newspapers of various countries told the people to rest assured. The newspapers of Germany, Russia, and Italy each wrote their one-sided articles; the newspapers of Britain and France were also divided into left and right factions. One side said that the Spanish "Popular Front" government could immediately eliminate the rebels. The other side said that General Franco would soon be the dictator of Spain. Reading only one side's newspapers could make you optimistic. But after reading both sides' newspapers, you become confused again. In fact, the Spanish Civil War continued for one month, two months, three months... Not only were the predictions on both sides not confirmed, but according to a foreign journalist who understood the current situation in Spain, if there are no unexpected changes, the civil war will last at least two or three years.</p>
<p>First, let us observe the strength of the two sides themselves. The "Popular Front" government, although said to have the support of the majority of the people, its ranks are a temporary gathering of the masses, lacking military experience. Therefore, although their numbers exceed those of General Franco's army, their combat effectiveness is less than that of General Franco's formally trained troops. It is precisely because of this that the two sides have created a situation of equal strength. However, without external assistance, this battle does not seem to be sustainable. Especially for General Franco's side, not only is replenishment difficult, but after a long war, he will lose his original characteristics. Moreover, the Spanish people have always had no good feelings for soldiers.</p>
<p>However, the current Spanish incident is an international event. It is a struggle between international socialists, communists, and some democrats against international fascists. Once there is an international background, the problem becomes complicated. For example, the main force on the Madrid front recently is mostly foreigners. The attackers are Moroccan natives, and the fascist youth of Germany and Italy. Striving to defend are socialists and communists from France, Russia, Belgium, Germany, and Italy. The Spanish people, in the Spanish Civil War, are playing a secondary role.</p>
<p>The Spanish, a passionate Southern European people, often show their bravery and fearlessness in the bullring. When the current civil war broke out, not only men, but even women joined the army. But this fearless courage still cannot turn them into good soldiers because they do not understand combat techniques. According to a report by a correspondent for the British Daily Herald who was sent to the Spanish war zone, he had a conversation with a front-line non-commissioned officer (this officer was a German socialist who participated in the European war, and after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, he voluntarily joined the "Popular Front" government to fight). This officer described the reasons for his defeat, which were not the strength of Franco's troops, but the fact that his own soldiers did not understand strategy and fought each on their own. He said, "The spirit of the Spanish in battle is very good. They are not afraid of death, but when you command them, you feel the difficulty. For example, once in the middle of the night, I ordered a night attack on the enemy's position. At that time, it was a very rare opportunity. But these soldiers did not obey the order. They said in unison: It is too dark, let's attack tomorrow." Such a good opportunity was missed. You see, they are not afraid of death, but they are afraid of the dark...</p>
<p>Yes, the Spanish are not a warlike nation. They see war as a game or a sport, at least like bullfighting. They cannot change their leisurely attitude even on the battlefield. This is probably one of the reasons why this civil war cannot be resolved immediately.</p>
<p>Naturally, the future of the Spanish incident will depend on how the international situation develops afterward. The Spanish, they are not the last to speak.</p>
<p>20. Whose Military Equipment is Superior After All?</p>
<p>The most patient people in the world are naturally diplomats. We only need to look at how, for several months, the diplomats of various countries in London have been singing the tune of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War, while allowing their own country's arms and volunteer soldiers to be transported to Spain batch by batch. France and Russia help the Popular Front government, Germany and Italy help General Franco. On the Madrid front, competing for victory are aircraft and artillery manufactured by the armories of France, Russia, Germany, and Italy. This is already an open secret. We can see some inside stories in the documents of diplomats from various countries attacking each other.</p>
<p>Germany helps General Franco because it is worried that if Spain becomes socialist, it will further promote France's leftward lean. A socialist neighbor is something that Germany under the rule of the National Socialist Party cannot sit idly by and watch. Italy's purpose is to create a fascist Spain as an ally of Italy, indirectly making the port of Gibraltar lose its military significance, and then competing with Britain for hegemony in the Mediterranean. What France fears is that if the "Popular Front" government fails, France will be surrounded by the three fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Spain, and will fundamentally lose its leading position in Europe. Russia, because it is a communist country, naturally sees the fascist movement as its mortal enemy. France and Russia are determined not to stand idly by and let General Franco use force to eliminate the Spanish "Popular Front" government. Thus, the Spanish Civil War has become an international event. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Replacement Japanese Troops Arrive in Pingjin, North China</h3>
<p>Total Troops Number 2,900, Actual Increase is About 700</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Japanese troops for the North China replacement arrived on the 1st. The total number of new troops, including infantry and artillery, is 2,900. On February 26th, they boarded the naval chartered ships Ikoma Maru, Hiromi Maru, and Meikai Maru at Fukuoka. They arrived at Qinhuangdao on the morning of the 28th and first docked at the Kailuan Wharf. Led by Transport Officer Captain Tanabe, they disembarked. The Japanese troops and residents in the Qin-Yu area, as well as returned soldiers, all went to the wharf for a grand welcome. At about 3 p.m., they boarded the Beining Railway in batches, forming two special trains. The first train had 24 cars, departing at 5:10 p.m., carrying a total of 2,080 troops, 12 field guns, 4 heavy guns, 50 light and heavy machine guns, and 100 horses. They arrived in Tianjin at 0:45 a.m. on the 1st. Among them, 480 troops disembarked immediately, receiving a warm welcome from over a thousand people, including the officers and soldiers of the 2nd Infantry Regiment stationed here, led by Kayashima, the head of the Ikegami Military Police Detachment, the chairman of the Tamura Veterans Association, Consul Kishi Ichi, Senior Adjutant Kawada, the National Defense Women's Association, all the veterans, and young volunteers. They then moved into the Li Mingzhuang new barracks. The remaining 600 troops remained on the original train and departed for Pingtong at 1:30 a.m., arriving early in the morning. The second train had 22 cars, departing from Qin Island at 9:30 p.m., arriving in Tianjin at 5:10 a.m. on the 1st, carrying a total of 820 troops, 6 field guns, 4 armored vehicles, 6 heavy-duty vehicles, 36 horses, and 24 machine guns. They received a warm welcome from Japanese officials and civilians at the East Station, and then marched in formation through Special District Three, the International Bridge, the French Concession, and into the Japanese Concession. They then passed through key streets such as Asahi Street and Hibiscus Street, receiving a welcoming crowd of residents. Then they moved into the Haiguang Temple barracks. On the 1st, all Japanese-owned businesses in the Japanese Concession hung flags to celebrate, expressing their boundless joy at the arrival of the new troops. At 7:70 p.m. on the same afternoon, the 800 troops being replaced boarded a special train of the Beining Railway and departed for Qin Island. At 10:40 p.m., another 320 troops being replaced from Beijing and Fengtai passed through Tianjin on a special train. 160 returning infantrymen from Tianjin also went along on the train, also heading to Qin Island. These two trains transported a total of 1,180 troops, scheduled to take the original ships carrying the new troops back to their country on the afternoon of the 2nd. Tadashiro has decided to inspect and address the newly arrived troops separately at the Li Mingzhuang and Haiguang Temple barracks on the morning of the 5th. The Japanese troops that have arrived this time, in addition to the 2,000 formally responsible for coming to garrison, are divided into two large battalions and incorporated into the Mutaguchi First and Kayashima Second Regiments stationed in Pingjin. There are also 900 newly enlisted soldiers, also divided into two large battalions, which are incorporated into the Kayashima Second, Suzuki Artillery, and Hikiji Chemical Tank units. Recently, it has been widely rumored in the north and south that Japan is increasing its troops in North China. The so-called troop increase is actually this.</p>
<p>Historically, the Japanese troops stationed in North China have been selected from the elite of various divisions in the country, with the idea of one being able to equal a hundred or ten. Newly enlisted soldiers have always been trained for six months before being incorporated into regular divisions. In terms of quality, they are not qualified to be stationed in North China. Now, the precedent has been reversed, becoming a real increase in strength by avoiding the weak and seeking the strong. There are not many troops being replaced belonging to the Kayashima Regiment; there are more belonging to the Mutaguchi Regiment. It is said that there are still second and third batches of troops, which will arrive around the end of this month and the beginning of April, when they will be deployed to the Ping-Feng area.

<h3>Counterfeit Money Making Ring Cracked in Beiping</h3>
<p>Four or Five Cases Cracked in One Day, Totaling Forty to Fifty Arrested</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The military and police agencies of Beiping City recently cracked four or five counterfeit money-making rings in one day, arresting no less than forty to fifty people, who have been sent to the Ji-Cha-Sui Pacification Headquarters. The main perpetrators will be sentenced to death and executed by firing squad in the shortest possible time to serve as a warning. On the 1st, the Military and Police Inspectorate received a report that the Huayuan Hotel in Xidan Shefansi was harboring people who were disrupting public order, planning to organize troops in Beiping, and attempting to rebel. The inspectorate dispatched detectives to the hotel in the afternoon together with police from the Second District. They arrested Yu Zhan'ao, Liu Guisheng, Zhang Zihua, Dong Dahong, and five others. Yu was the leader. Liu was a cyclist police officer in Beiping City and is now a salt smuggling police officer. Zhang and Dong had privately recruited soldiers and organized mercenary troops, dressed luxuriously like rich men, and their comings and goings in the hotel were quite noticeable. After Yu and others were arrested and taken to the agency for questioning, they confessed that they had been in contact with a certain party, recruiting 1,000 new soldiers. Later, because the other party only agreed to give 2,000 yuan, which was not enough to use, the result was abandoned. They said that there are still hundreds of subordinates in the county territory of Hebei Province, etc. After investigation by the agency, it was determined that the hundreds of people in Hebei Province mentioned by Yu and others were just bluffs and there was no such thing. The agency decided to send Yu and others to the Sui Headquarters for questioning on the 2nd. It is also learned that Yu's name is also Xiao Yan. He once served as a brigade commander of a certain army. Three years ago, after Zhang Jingyao was assassinated in the Six Nations Hotel in Dongjiaominxiang, Beiping, when his surviving family was fighting for the property, Zhang's sister's house was suddenly robbed by bandits. This case was related to Yu, and he was arrested once, but he was released not long after. And Yu's old habits have not changed, and he often uses fraud and illegal things under the name of him. It is heard that the fraud and deception of Song Zheyuan's name recently discovered in Beiping City was done by them. (-1st)</p>
<h3>Suzhou Prison Guard Appeals Trial Opens</h3>
<p>Hou Qixiang, a prison guard at Songjiang County Prison, was sentenced to two years in prison by the Songjiang District Court for escaping prisoners. Hou Qixiang refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court. The county escorted Hou Qixiang to Suzhou and detained him in the High Court Detention Center. On the morning of the 3rd, Judge Zhang of the High Court brought Hou to court for detailed questioning and ordered him to be returned to custody to await notification of the Songjiang water patrol captain in charge of the case before setting a date for the trial.</p>
<h3>Changshu Worker Electrocuted and Dies</h3>
<p>The widening of the First Main Road here, from the South Gate to the Hanbei Gate, has been widened to ten meters in width. The Jiangsu Bank on the County South Street is also being demolished. Work began on the 1st of this month. On the afternoon of the 2nd, when the facade and roof were being removed, a craftsman named Gu Shengji, due to standing unstable, accidentally touched the 3,300-pound high-voltage line passing through the electrical plant with his left hand. Gu was immediately sucked up. Later, his colleagues used wooden objects to rescue him from the line, but his face was charred and he died. It was learned that Gu was from outside the East Gate, and there were still an old mother and children at home who relied on him for their livelihood. The deceased has been reported by the foreman to the court for inspection and burial.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Qichang Adds Power Plant</h3>
<p>The Qishuyan Power Plant of the Construction Committee, in order to expand its business scope, in addition to signing power supply contracts with Yixing Power Plant and the Changxing County mining area in Zhejiang Province, has also enclosed an area of more than 460 mu north of Bei Wangting to build the First Power Plant to supply electricity to various counties. This place is located at the entrance of Taihu Lake, where lake water flows in and the water is extremely cold, so it is very suitable. The electric lights used in various places in the town and country of this county are also supplied by the factory. However, the office buildings of the factory's office in Wuxi are insufficient for use, and the original site of the Xinguang Theater in Guangfu Gate has now been purchased, and a three-story mansion is planned to be built, which will be able to start construction soon.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Minfeng Yarn Factory Strike</h3>
<p>Female workers at the Minfeng Yarn Factory outside Xiaonanmen in Wuyi, due to opposition to the factory's training class and trainee workers, suddenly went on strike on the 28th of last month in the preparation room. The factory persuaded them to resume work, but at 6 p.m. on the 2nd of this month, the night shift female workers suddenly went on strike again. It was ineffective to persuade them to stop. As a result, the factory's night work was completely shut down. The factory's business room, general affairs room, and meeting room were all vandalized by the striking female workers, causing considerable damage. The county police station reported it, and immediately sent Chief Inspector Wu Shengfang and Security Police Team Deputy Miao Gan Jie to lead more than 20 armed team soldiers to maintain order and persuade representatives to be responsible for the negotiations. The female workers said that we are all representatives, and there is no need to elect representatives again. It was not resolved until the morning of the 3rd.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Jiangsu Agricultural Bank Promotes Cooperation</h3>
<p>In order to promote its business and study ways to deeply enter the countryside, the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank specially convened a business meeting of branch presidents, managers, and directors at the Zhenjiang Head Office.

He first studied in Japan and the United States, earning a Doctor of Law degree from Yale University in 1905. The following year, he went to Europe, where he extensively studied law and international law in England, France, and Germany, and obtained a British barrister qualification. He gained prominence in diplomatic circles when Dr. Sun Yat-sen appointed him as the Minister of Foreign Affairs during his time as Provisional President in 1912. In 1921, he served as the chief representative of China to the League of Nations and a delegate to the Washington Conference. He also served as the Minister of Justice several times and as the Minister of Education in 1923, concurrently acting as the Prime Minister. In 1923, he was elected as a judge substitute to the International Court of Justice, traveling to The Hague for over a year before returning to China.

Mr. Li Shizeng delivered a speech. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Guests Attending</p>
<p>The guests invited yesterday included Wu Tiecheng, Wang Longhui, Yang Hu, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Chu Minyi, Lin Kanghou, Pan Gongzhan, Zhou Zuomin, Wu Yunzhai, Qian Xinzhi, Xiao Zhenying, Li Dachao, Geng Jiaji, Cai Wuji, He Shangjue, Lu Gaoyi, Feng Youzhen, Yang Guangzheng, and more than 200 others, which was quite a grand occasion. The students of the World School first performed various recreational activities, which were innocent, lively, and extraordinary.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's Speech</p>
<p>Subsequently, Mr. Li Shizeng delivered a welcome speech, saying: "Today, the World Society, the World Cultural Cooperation China Association, the World Academy, the World Cooperative Publishing Association, the China International Group, and the World School are welcoming Mr. Vedastus and all the guests. Mr. Vedastus is renowned in French cultural circles. This trip to China for investigation was recommended by the Diderot Society. The Diderot Society was organized by the French cultural community to commemorate the great 18th-century philosopher Diderot. The society's members have published many famous works, making significant contributions to world culture. The society recommends one person from the cultural community to come to China for investigation each year, and Mr. Vedastus's visit is the society's recommendation. The society also works with groups with similar aims in more than 50 countries to jointly promote and communicate world culture. The society currently has an agreement with the Shanghai China International Group to exchange books, and thousands of books have been donated, which are displayed in the auditorium. More will continue to be sent. Diderot's life's work was greatest in creating and compiling the encyclopedia, and the relationship between the Diderot Society and the Chinese cultural community is so deep. I would like to take this opportunity to announce two things: First, the China International Library will hold an exhibition of various encyclopedias from all over the world. Second, the World Encyclopedia compiled by the World Cooperative Publishing Association has been prepared for a long time and will soon be published. These two undertakings are of great importance to Chinese culture. I believe that the representative of the Diderot Society and all the guests will be happy to hear this at this welcome meeting." Finally, Mr. Vedastus replied, saying that as a representative of the Diderot Society, he deeply respected the upcoming publication of the World Encyclopedia and wished it success.</p>
<h3>Sufficient Rice Supply in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Totaling 500,000 Dan, Maintaining Three Months of Food for the People</p>
<p>According to the Dagong Society, the food needed in Shanghai relies on the supply of rice from the rice-producing areas of neighboring provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In the past, the transportation and sales were balanced, and the stock of rice in Shanghai was at most only 200,000 to 300,000 dan, as preparation for adjusting surpluses and deficits. However, last year, the agricultural production in various places was abundant, and the transportation and sales were convenient. Shanghai has become a central zone for transportation and sales and transshipment. The river rice came to Shanghai in congestion, and because of the Great Closure, they were sold at lowered market prices. Therefore, various merchants took this opportunity to purchase in large quantities. The food currently stored in various firms, warehouses, and rice shops has reached more than 500,000 dan, which is enough to supply the people's food for three months.</p>
<p>Rice Transportation and Sales Centrally Registered</p>
<p>In the past, merchants in this city purchased rice from the interior. The original merchants first registered with the guild and then reported to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which issued a purchase passport for certification. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau felt that this method was still not appropriate. In accordance with the orders of the government department, the registration of rice production and sales was drafted, and after the registration measures were promulgated, the firms had to submit the quantity of lotus sales to the bureau for centralized registration. The people's food stock of the bureau handles this matter, the number is very large, mostly to Zhejiang Province Jiaxing Jiashan Pinghu and other places as the main place, to the Jiangsu Province, because the inland counties river rice daily supply, so merchants directly purchase, the number is limited.</p>
<p>Recent - Week Rice Market Review</p>
<p>Since the rice price in this city gradually fell since the winter of last year, until now, it has slightly rebounded. The distant reason is that the agricultural production was abundant last year, and the food supply exceeded demand. Since the end of the Great Closure, although the money supply has eased, the merchants and residents had already accumulated a lot at the end of last year. In addition, since this spring, a large amount of rice from the interior has been sold to the outside, and the river rice has come in steadily, filling the market. This led to a surplus of supply over demand, so sales were sluggish. Although the explicit price rose last week, the implicit price still fell back. Recently, due to the impact of rising prices of various goods, rice prices have also slightly increased, but sales have still not improved. Rice transportation merchants, 90% of them have reported losses.</p>

(2) Due to the relationship of land lease period, often the lease expires, that is, demolition, view from this point, according to the original design period is too much. (2) The machine set sixteen six years is still too high, with the machine used to more than ten years its effectiveness has been levied, (3) The tools, eight years is too high, (4) Cast iron appliances, twenty years is too high, (5) Decoration, ten years is too high, probably like the dance floor, once a year, the average of five or six years - times, (6) Depreciation rate, should be based on the original price calculation, the most convenient, (7) Depreciation rate, there should be a maximum and minimum limit, corresponding letter reply for checking.</p>

<h3>Yangtze River One Road Trial Run of Money-Free Electricity and Water and Land Communication</h3>
<p>Trial Implementation Starts Tomorrow</p>
<p>Wireless electricity has now spread throughout the country and is connected to foreign countries. However, water and land communication has not yet been realized. The Jiangsu Provincial Directorate General of Telecommunications has been preparing for this matter for a long time. It was not until today that it was completed. It is approved to use the Yangtze River transport of the state-run China Merchants Bureau as the preliminary stage of the trial of water and land wireless electricity. In the future, we will continue to seek expansion to the outer sea wheels. This matter is still a pioneering initiative. The general situation of the two is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Jiang Lun Installation Electricity</p>
<p>In the past, only a few first-class ships of the Yangtze River ships were equipped with money-free telegraph machines, and they were not all equipped uniformly. Last year, the Ministry of Communications issued a notice to all Yangtze River ships, requiring them to uniformly install wireless electric machines for the purpose of receiving and sending along the way. The China Merchants Bureau's Jiang wheels, due to their state-owned status as leaders in the shipping industry, ordered all Jiang wheels to be equipped with wireless telegraph transceivers last year, which have now been fully installed. The test transmission and reception has been very effective.</p>
<p>Preparation of Communications</p>

<h3>Stamp Tax Penalty Rules Chamber of Commerce Explains Doubts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday replied to the Fruit and Produce Trade Association, explaining doubts regarding stamp tax penalty rules. Respectfully, on the 2nd of this month, we received your letter inquiring about doubts concerning stamp tax penalties. Our reply is as follows: ㊀ Although the penalty for failing to affix a one-cent stamp is also between ten and thirty times the amount, according to Article 8, paragraph 2 of the Stamp Tax Law, because the multiple is less than three yuan, the minimum penalty is still three yuan. In other words, although the legal penalty has a maximum multiple of thirty, the minimum amount is three yuan. For example, if a one-dime stamp is not affixed, the penalty calculated at thirty times is three yuan, and if a one-cent stamp is not affixed, the penalty is also three yuan due to the limitation of paragraph 2 of that article. ㊁ The penalty reduced by half should be interpreted as being between five and fifteen times. Increased penalties should be calculated accordingly. ㊂ If the stamp duty should be thirty yuan, and no stamps are affixed, the penalty based on ten to thirty times should be between two hundred and six hundred yuan. If stamps are affixed in an amount not exceeding the requirement and the penalty is reduced by half, the fine should be between one hundred and three hundred yuan. ㊃ The so-called "the most important item which must not exceed its actual facts" should be penalized twice the amount of the fine. For example, if there are ten invoices and ten account books, all without stamps, if each item is penalized, each of the ten invoices should be fined three yuan, and each of the ten account books should be fined six yuan, totaling ninety yuan. However, the most serious item in this case is the failure to affix stamps to the invoices and account books, so the penalty is combined, but it cannot exceed three times the penalty for the most serious item. In other words, the matter is closed by fining each account book three times the fine of six yuan, resulting in an eighteen yuan fine. ㊄ For cases decided by the Shanghai District Court, appeals should be made to the Suzhou High Court. For cases decided by the Special First District Court, appeals can be made to the High Court Second Branch. For cases decided by the Special First District Court, appeals can be made to the High Court First Branch.</p>
<h3>German Consulate to be Rebuilt</h3>
<p>According to a translation from the Dalu Bao, the German Consulate has announced that a new building will be constructed. The construction plan will be finalized soon, and the construction work is expected to begin this summer and be completed next year. From April 1st, the consulate will temporarily relocate to No. 10 Beijing Road for office operations. The old buildings on Huangpu Road will be demolished at the same time. It is reported that the German Consulate was built in 1884 and celebrated its completion on March 24, 1886, along with celebrations for the German Emperor's birthday. Since then, times have changed, and the consulate has undergone several transformations, becoming the current style after 1903.</p>
<h3>A Person Familiar with Municipal Affairs Discusses the Issue of Road Construction Beyond the Boundary</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Shanghai Public Concession's Municipal Council is collecting property taxes for road construction beyond the boundary from property owners, which has caused opposition from the property owners. This case has attracted attention from all walks of life. Yesterday, a reporter visited a person familiar with municipal affairs. According to them, the Public Concession's Municipal Council engaged in road construction beyond the boundary three times in the past to expand the concession. At that time, civil wars frequently broke out in the country, and the number of refugees seeking shelter increased daily. As a result, the number of residents in the concession increased sharply. Moreover, the Chinese people's national consciousness was weak, and they did not pay attention, so the road construction beyond the boundary in western and northern Shanghai progressed very widely. However, this kind of behavior has no legal basis and is an act of infringing on China's sovereignty. In 1924, the Chinese Nationalist Party held its first national congress and issued a declaration policy, striving for the integrity of territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people gradually became aware. The May 30th Massacre in 1925 was a major cause of road construction beyond the boundary. After this case, the Municipal Council stopped expanding road construction beyond the boundary. Later, the Shanghai Municipal Government negotiated with the Municipal Council to thoroughly resolve the issue of road construction beyond the boundary, but it was hindered by various obstacles, and it remains unresolved to this day. Since the Municipal Council's road construction beyond the boundary is an illegal act, it naturally has no jurisdiction over the roads and areas along the roads in terms of legal principles. The police and various public utilities in all sections of the road construction beyond the boundary should be under the responsibility of the municipal government, which should instruct the relevant bureaus to handle them. However, the Municipal Council intends to collect property taxes from residents on both sides of the road by using the excuse of water and electricity supply and signing agreements, which is ultimately futile. We also know that when the Municipal Council installs water and electricity for users on both sides of the road construction beyond the boundary, it must require them to fill out an application form or sign a contract, stating that they are willing to pay taxes to the Municipal Council. The council uses this as evidence that it can collect property taxes, but private contracts must not conflict with national laws, otherwise they are invalid. If national laws conflict with international conventions, their validity must also be suspended. Therefore, the Municipal Council's attempt to collect property taxes from residents on both sides of the road construction beyond the boundary is fundamentally invalid in terms of law and fact. Otherwise, why doesn't the Municipal Council sign agreements with residents within the boundary to pay general taxes for water and electricity? The person also said that in order to eradicate all kinds of disputes arising from road construction beyond the boundary, we must strengthen our belief in resolving the issue of road construction beyond the boundary and hope that all parties will jointly urge the authorities to negotiate in order to achieve early realization and avoid difficulties for residents.</p>
<h3>National Federation of Commerce Sends Telegram to Ministry of Finance to Abolish Harsh Taxes in Hunan Province</h3>
<h3>Harmful to Merchants and People, a Disguised Form of Likin Taxes: Swiftly Abolish to Alleviate Merchants' Hardships</h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating, "We have recently received a letter from the Xiangtan County Chamber of Commerce in Hunan, stating that the chairmen of the Xiangtan Silk and Cloth Industry Association, Chai Xiaoquan, the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, Zhang Haikun, the Southern Goods Industry Association, Dai Bingkun, the Jiangsu and Guangdong Industry Association, Wang Liyang, and the Vegetarian Restaurant Industry Association, Huang Bingwen, have submitted a petition stating that shops, etc., earnestly requested the abolition of production and sales taxes, postal parcel taxes, and surcharges, which are similar to Likin taxes that exploit the people, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants and enrich the people's livelihoods, etc., in October of last year. We requested that this be forwarded to you. More than a year has passed, and these taxes have not been abolished, which is a clear violation of the National Government's order to abolish Likin taxes in April 1931. The Hunan Provincial Government, due to its financial depletion, has implemented a tax similar to Likin taxes to avoid the notorious name of Likin tax. It has implemented a special tax on production and sales, which was announced on November 3, 1931, and implemented on the same day. Not only does it harm merchants and people, but it also harms national interests. Now that national unification has been achieved, all government orders should be unified to demonstrate the dignity of the state. It is not appropriate to leave this stain of production and sales tax, which will give neighboring countries an excuse and burden the people. Therefore, the Congress is earnestly requested to forward this petition, requesting the abolition of the single-line production and sales tax, postal parcel tax, and surcharges, in order to respect the decree and alleviate the hardships of merchants, etc. According to this, it is noted that the central government's case for abolishing Likin taxes has strict restrictions, and it does not allow the existence of any taxes similar to Likin taxes, which would hinder national planning. The clear orders have been issued repeatedly, and all provinces have strictly complied, daring not to violate them. Hunan Province is not an uncivilized region, and it should be treated the same. However, the clear order to abolish Likin taxes was issued, and the tax on production and sales was immediately implemented. The harsh policies of the Qing Dynasty have nominally disappeared, but the reality remains. What other provinces dare not do, Hunan Province openly writes. It is said that this is not a violation of the upper order. In fact, no country in the world has such a law. If the central government does not issue a strict order to abolish it, I am afraid that it will not be able to explain the misunderstanding in the general case. The various unfavorable points mentioned by the shops are all true situations. Because of the pain of the production and sales tax, it has been over six years. It is unbearable and impossible to pay. The repeated requests are truly a last resort. This association is a representative of the people's organizations, and it is not convenient to block the reporting to the superiors, so as not to obscure the revolutionary government's intention to relieve the suffering of the people. In addition to reporting to the Military Commission, the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, we are correspondingly requesting your association to immediately provide consistent support to the Hunan Provincial Tax Supervision Committee and the National Federation of Commerce, so that we can abolish it as soon as possible in order to alleviate the hardships of merchants, etc. According to this, it is noted that the various sections presented are all true. The production and sales tax is a disguised form of Likin tax, which harms merchants and people to the extreme. There is a real need to consistently request the government to abolish it as soon as possible. In addition to submitting separate reports, we are correspondingly requesting your association to investigate and uphold justice, urge the government to abolish it as soon as possible, etc. Approved. We have accordingly telegraphed and presented it to various ministries for verification, earnestly requesting approval to order the Hunan Provincial Government to consider the hardships of the people and abolish it immediately. The chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Lin Kanghou, kowtows and seals.</p>
<h3>Currency Exchange Business Reforms</h3>
<p>Abolish 95% Interest Discount; Strive to Support National Products Businesses</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Currency Exchange Association member money houses were listed, in addition to reforming the check style and implementing new accounting, the rules and regulations were stipulated: 1. The interest on current deposits will be decided by the association members convened by this association every month. If there is a call loan, the minimum amount is two yuan per thousand yuan, all calculated with a 95% discount. "Now it has been abolished at the cost of pain. Therefore, in February, the call loan interest rate was two yuan and five corners. Each money house has abolished the 95% discount. Moreover, each money house has begun to distribute booklets to customers for transactions, which were completed the day before yesterday. This year's new business policy focuses on the credit of national products businesses. Therefore, the purpose of loans secured by goods and commodities is to develop with the support of the financial industry. However, loans secured by real estate and other immovable properties will be given special care to avoid being burdened.</p>
<h3>Central Department of Civil Training Collects Regulations of Various Industries</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Party Department received Official Letter No. 5978 from the Central Executive Committee's Department of Civil Training yesterday, ordering the collection of regulations of various industries. The original letter roughly states, "Upon investigation, the regulations of various industries in various places often have obstacles in implementation and are difficult to implement, and disputes often occur, which affect commerce. This is no small matter. In order to find appropriate solutions for relief purposes, the Department plans to collect the regulations of various important cities and provincial capitals as a reference for research. In addition to distributing letters separately, we are correspondingly requesting an investigation and compliance and hope to see a reply." After receiving the letter, the Department immediately printed and distributed the original letter to inform the various industry associations and set a deadline of one week after receiving the letter to submit a copy for compilation and forwarding.</p>

<h3>Three Criminals in the Le Zhenbao Extortion Case Sentenced</h3>
<p>On November 6th of last year, several bandits armed with weapons broke into the cigarette and paper shop opened by Lu Xi at 534 Avenue Edward VII and robbed 342 yuan in large and small legal tender. When they fled with the stolen goods, they were arrested and a struggle ensued. The bandits Tian Linchang and Wang Acai were apprehended on the spot, and one bandit was killed. When interrogating the case, it was found that Yang Changeng, an accomplice in the case, was arrested for another crime in the French Concession and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Yang was sentenced to four years and six months of imprisonment and transferred to the Xinzha Police Station to be tried together with Tian and Wang. The police found that Yang had colluded with others on October 5th of last year to extort 10,000 yuan in legal tender from Le Zhenbao, the owner of the Taichang Woodware Company on Nanjing Road, and was involved in the robbery of Zhang Peiying's house at 154 Xinzha Road. The court held several hearings and the confessions were clear. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng presided over the sentencing in the Eighth Court. Tian Linchang and Gan Acai, as recidivists, were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for colluding with one or more people, carrying weapons, and breaking into a residence at night to steal. Mei Changeng, also known as Gao Bitou Changeng, as a recidivist, was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment for colluding and threatening others to hand over their property unsuccessfully. As a recidivist, he was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment for colluding with three or more people, carrying weapons, and breaking into a residence at night to rob. The sentences were to be carried out from June of last year. The other parts were acquitted. One handgun, nine bullets, one dagger, and one opium pipe and lamp were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Autopsy Results of Male Corpse in Sack</h3>
<h3>Died from Injuries; Not Like a Laborer</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the first of this month, a male corpse placed in a sack was dug up by a worker at the Li Yunji work site on the barren land east of Pingliang Road and Ningwu Road. The Yangshupu Police Station sent detectives to transport the corpse to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. The First Special Court appointed Prosecutor Tang and forensic doctors to examine the corpse. As the cause of death was unknown, an autopsy was scheduled. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now known that the corpse was thoroughly dissected and examined by forensic doctors Wei and Zhang, and it was determined that the deceased died from injuries. The injuries were on the glabella, left lip, and left chest, etc., all showing purple swelling and bleeding in the right lung. It was also found that the corpse was about twenty years old, and judging from the fingers and other parts, he did not look like a laborer.</p>
<h3>Child Dies of Illness After Autopsy</h3>
<p>Song Mo, from Shaoxing, runs a laundry and dyeing shop at 1050 Broadway Road in Hongkou. He had a son named Qingyuan, who is now three years old. Around December of last year in the lunar calendar, he suddenly contracted measles, which later healed, but then turned into diarrhea. He was treated by Xu Xiaopu, a specialist in pediatrics and a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine. After examination and prescription, Dr. Xu introduced him to the Tongfu Hospital at 21 Tongfu Lane, opposite the Racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road. It was found that the hospital was run by Dr. Xu himself. Mr. Song followed his instructions and went for treatment. He was first diagnosed by Dr. Fei Min (Zi Zhonghua). After being diagnosed with pneumonia, he was given four injections of pneumonia cardiotonic. When he went for treatment the last time, Dr. Fei was not there, so Dr. Xu Xiaopu's son injected Zhu Qingyuan in the buttocks. After this injection, the buttocks of the Song child showed signs of ulceration. He was sent to the same hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died on the 28th of last month. Mr. Song then reported to the Hongkou Police Station, ordering the detectives to carry the corpse to the Forensic Examination Office on Feilun Road. The other day, Zhang Zongxu, the prosecutor appointed by the First Special Court, arrived for examination. Song Mo and her husband, Song Baoshan, explained the previous situation. Prosecutor Zhang determined that it was necessary to perform an autopsy on Song Qingyuan's cause of death, whether it was due to illness or a medical error. He ordered that Song's cause of death was unknown, and after the autopsy was performed by the forensic doctor, it was handed over to his father, Song Baoshan, for burial. The results of the autopsy performed by forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Zhang Yan are as follows: "Purulent liquid in the right chest and purulent emboli in the lung tissue indicate purulent pleurisy and pneumonia, which are primary. The mortality rate of this type of lung pleurisy is very high in children. As for the ulcer on the buttocks, it was caused by the stimulation of the injection of medicine and cannot be considered a direct cause of death. Therefore, the deceased died of illness." A report has been prepared and sent to the Prosecutor's Office for review.</p>
<h3>Li Guojie Case Continues in Enforcement Court Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Defendant Requests Flexible Handling; China Merchants Bureau to Request Instructions from Ministry</h3>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, embezzled 750,000 taels of public funds, plus interest of 1.209 million. The private prosecution portion, since Chu Qiaqing and Li Sihao provided a bond on June 1 of last year, has not paid a penny. Previously, the China Merchants Bureau found that the Maolu Farm in Jintan County was Li's private property. Also, Li mortgaged shares of Changhua Iron Mine Co., Ltd. in Fanchang County, Anhui, etc. at the Siming Bank for 30,000 yuan on November 25, 1935, requesting enforcement. The court discussed the investigation. Regarding the Maolu Farm, Jintan County had been entrusted to investigate and it was not Ji Guojie's property. Therefore, at 2 p.m. yesterday, Judge Wang Fengqiu of the District Court held an enforcement hearing in the Criminal Court. Yan Zu, Shi Naixiu of the Siming Bank, appeared in court and stated that Li Guojie mortgaged the goods in the name of Li Weihou. The goods included 5,000 shares of Changhua Iron Mine Co., Ltd. and a British horse clothing inlaid with red and blue diamonds, mortgaged for 30,000 yuan, with a six-month term and monthly interest of 1%. However, it was found that the current value of the shares was less than 5,000 yuan, and Li was the manager of the company. The Siming Bank had priority in receiving compensation for the mortgaged goods, etc. The official stated that the goods should be handed over to the case first, and the Siming Bank could file a separate lawsuit for compensation and obtain a legal judgment. At this point, the official asked Li Guojie to confess whether he had no property or money to provide for enforcement. Li replied that his family was a prominent family, so it was impossible for him to have no money. Li replied that after his family divided into four branches, he failed every time he ran a social enterprise, so he had no property. The official said that this would not solve the problem. Therefore, his lawyers, Lv Shifang and Jiang Yiping, requested that the case be handled in accordance with Article 7 of the Enforcement Law. Jiang Hechun, the lawyer for the China Merchants Bureau, said that regarding the defendant's lawyer's previous statement that Article 7 of the Enforcement Law should be followed in the first half, his lawyer had reported to the China Merchants Bureau to report to the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry's order did not allow it. Therefore, he still requested continued enforcement. At this point, Lv and Jiang, both lawyers, said that then, please follow the second half of Article 7 of the Enforcement Law to bring the case to a temporary end. On the one hand, the China Merchants Bureau can continue to investigate property and continue enforcement, which will benefit both the plaintiff and the defendant. Lawyer Jiang then said that his lawyer could not make the decision and would wait for a report to the China Merchants Bureau and then request instructions from the Ministry before the court was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Da Xin Money House Manager He Erzhen Arrested</h3>
<h3>Shareholders Investigate Accounts and Discover Embezzlement; He Was Arrested While Attending Meeting</h3>
<p>Da Xin Money House at 109 Broadway Road was founded by He Erzhen and six other people from Zhenjiang Dantu. It was opened in the spring of 1934 with a capital of 20,000 yuan. It was reorganized once on February 19 of last year. He Erzhen served as a shareholder and manager with a monthly salary of 30 yuan. At the end of the year, due to poor business, Lawyer Wu Peng served as an accountant to investigate the accounts. It was found that He had privately made speculative transactions and secretly used 3,915.45 yuan in national currency. The other day, the shareholders held a shareholders' meeting at Lawyer Wu's office at 25 Lane 225, Baker Road. He Erzhen also came to participate and was secretly reported to the Hongkou Police Station. Hua Youshan, a Chinese detective, rushed to the address and arrested him. He was taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, explained the case and stated that it was found that He had handled loans totaling 3,802.21 yuan. The case was postponed for further investigation to avoid any risk of escape. All accounts were presented for investigation. He Erzhen was questioned, and his confession was vague. The judge still ordered him to be detained for further review.</p>
<h3>Over Fifty Manufacturers Participate in Guangzhou National Exhibition</h3>
<h3>Scheduled to Be Held on Yuexiu Mountain on the Fifth</h3>
<p>Since the unification of Guangdong Province last year, the national goods in this city have begun to be shipped to Guangdong in batches. Guangdong Province has also actively promoted them. The Guangdong Branch of the National Economic Construction Promotion Association has also joined with various agencies to establish the National Goods Movement Association, and sent Director Shou Moqing to Shanghai to contact various manufacturers in Shanghai to join the association and participate in the National Goods Exhibition Conference to be held in May this year. After Shou came to Shanghai, he contacted various manufacturers separately for days, and most of them had approved to participate. The reporter from Shenzhou News Agency met with Shou yesterday to learn about the participation in the exhibition and the promotion of Chinese goods in Guangdong.</p>
<p>Guangdong National Goods Association Cooperates with Shanghai</p>
<p>According to Shou, Guangzhou is one of the largest commercial ports in the country with huge consumption. However, due to the backwardness of local industry and its proximity to Hong Kong, foreign goods are prevalent. Last year, the provincial government was reorganized, and Shanghai's national goods were sold to Guangdong more and more. Recently, the Guangdong Branch of the National Economic Construction Movement Association, together with more than 20 party, government, and commercial agencies and organizations, organized the National Goods Movement Promotion Association, specializing in advocating and promoting national goods. In order to strengthen the association's power and facilitate the promotion of the national goods movement, Shou was specially sent to Shanghai to publicly solicit manufacturers in Shanghai to participate as members. As a result of the negotiations in recent days, more than 50 manufacturers have joined as members, willing to take the same attitude as Guangdong and jointly seek to promote the promotion of national goods. More than 90% of Shanghai's industrial products are shipped to Guangdong, which can be greatly improved in the future, replacing the position of foreign goods. Currently, most of the intellectual class in Guangdong Province has fully used national goods.</p>
<p>Manufacturers Participate in Guangzhou National Exhibition</p>
<p>In the past, Guangdong has held small-scale national goods exhibitions, and Shanghai has always participated. Now, in order to enable people in Guangdong Province to recognize more national goods products in order to proceed with planning, the National Goods Promotion Association plans to hold a large-scale national goods exhibition in Guangzhou Yuexiu Mountain in May this year. Yuexiu Mountain has a large area and beautiful scenery. Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall is also built there. This conference will attract the attention of people from all over Guangdong. After Shou came to Shanghai to negotiate with various manufacturers, those who were prepared to participate were very enthusiastic, including Kang Yuan, Mei Ya, Wu Xiang, China Chemical Industry Corporation, Central Glass Factory, Hongyu Weaving Factory, Tianyi Weaving Factory, Yaguang Company, Huafu Hat Factory, Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, etc., more than 50 manufacturers. It is said that the exhibition period is one month.</p>
<h3>He Kangli Accused of Raping a Teenage Girl</h3>
<p>Scheming to Marry Her Off to Another, Age Discrepancy in Dispute</p>
<p>A woman from Hunan named Luo Xi, 17 years old this year, lost both her parents at a young age and was fostered by a merchant named Wei from her hometown. Therefore, she is also known as Wei Xuezhen, raised by the Wei family. Last year, she entered the first grade of Weinan Junior High School in Hunan. Because her foster father engaged in inappropriate behavior towards her, she and Xu Zuomin, the daughter of Xu Xinyuan, an actress at the Star Film Company in this city, came to Shanghai to study in August of last year. She enrolled in the Shanghai</p>
<p>Women's Supplementary</p>
<p>School. During this time, she met Li Chang'e and Liu Binru, students at the Xinhua Art Academy from her hometown, and He Kangli, a student at the Shanghai Art Academy and a teacher at Guangxia Middle School. They often visited each other. On October 19th of last year, Luo went to He Kangli's residence in the pavilion room number 16, Tiancheng Lane, Xuehuali Road, in the French Concession, to borrow a bed. Unexpectedly, He forcibly raped her and then promised to marry her. However, after a few romantic encounters, Luo</p>
<p>secretly became pregnant.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the plaintiff described the circumstances of the rape and the incitement to commit adultery and abandonment, and hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay damages, consolation money, and living expenses (40 yuan per month until the age of 50), totaling 14,000 yuan. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. The court, noting a dispute over the age of the parties, deemed it necessary to summon witnesses for investigation and adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 6th for further questioning. The defendant was remanded in custody. He Kangli was urged to hold the wedding as soon as possible, but unexpectedly, He put forward two absurd conditions to Luo: first, Luo should commit adultery with Liu Baoru, a fellow villager, so that the responsibility for Luo's child could be shifted to Liu in the future; second, Luo should commit suicide with him in the Huangpu River to pressure Luo. In desperation, Luo had to agree to the first condition proposed by He and acted accordingly. After being deceived, Liu Binru gathered</p>
<p>fellow villagers for a banquet</p>
<p>and publicly announced He Kangli's scheme. From then on, He Kangli became enraged and scolded Luo for revealing the secret, and then abandoned her. Luo, having no relatives or fellow villagers to turn to in Shanghai, felt lost and helpless, and had no choice but to seek help from the French Concession police and the Second Special Court. He Kangli, hearing of this, fled to Nanjing to hide. After a long time, thinking that the heat had died down, he</p>
<p>secretly returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>around October 20th. Luo Xi discovered this and reported it on the 27th. The French Concession police dispatched detective Wu Wengang to arrest He and escort him to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. This newspaper briefly reported the situation. Yesterday morning, Liao Gong, the presiding judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, conducted a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court. Yao Zhao, the lawyer from the Police Department, Chen Lin, stated the case, saying that the defendant had raped a girl under the age of sixteen and continued to commit adultery. The defendant had confessed to this during the investigation by the Police Department. He is now being prosecuted in accordance with Article 227, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, requesting</p>
<p>a lawful trial.</p>
<p>The plaintiff described the circumstances of the rape and the incitement to commit adultery and abandonment, and hired a lawyer to file a private prosecution, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay damages, consolation money, and living expenses (40 yuan per month until the age of 50), totaling 24,000 yuan. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. The court, noting a dispute over the age of the parties, deemed it necessary to summon witnesses for investigation and adjourned the hearing to the morning of the 6th for further questioning. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<h3>Xu Ruifu's Home Robbed of Valuable Diamond Jewelry</h3>
<p>Valued at More Than 17,500 Gold</p>
<p>Xu Ruifu, residing at No. 6, An Village, Lane 423, Avenue Foch, French Concession, was at home at 2:40 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd, when it was drizzling. Suddenly, five or six robbers came, used a previously prepared Chubb key to open the back door, and rushed inside. They brandished a Mauser pistol and a handgun, ordering everyone to remain silent. They first confined Xu's family and servants in a room, with one robber guarding the door. The other robbers went upstairs, entered the rooms, and rummaged through chests and cabinets. They stole three large and small diamond rings, three jade rings, two pairs of pearl earrings, large and small diamonds, gold brooches, pearl flowers, gold bracelets, platinum necklaces, jade necklaces, antique porcelain vases, gold Ruyi scepters, gold necklaces, and other items, totaling more than 17,500 gold. They also stole 700 yuan in cash. The robbers then fled with their loot. Afterwards, the victim provided a detailed list of the stolen items and reported it to the French Concession police, who dispatched detectives to investigate and issued a general warrant for the strict arrest of the robbers and their prosecution.</p>
<h3>General Assembly of Members of the Cultural Construction Association</h3>
<p>To Be Held on the 3rd and 4th of Next Month</p>
<p>The Chinese Cultural Construction Association will hold its first general assembly of members in Shanghai on the 3rd and 4th of next month. The organizational rules for the general assembly have also been approved by the Board of Directors.

<h3>Italian Woman Detained in Dalian Released and Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>External Commentary Translated from Mainland Newspaper: The case of Mrs. Vansber and her two daughters being detained by the authorities in Dalian last September caused a sensation at the time. It has now come to an end. Mrs. Vansber has recently been released and left Manchuria for Shanghai last week. Mr. Vansber arrived in Shanghai at the end of September last year. He is an Italian and claims to be a citizen of the Republic of China. He used to run a film business in Harbin and had a famous cinema there. Later, due to the global economic downturn affecting Harbin, he incurred a huge debt. All the cinema's assets were auctioned off by a court to settle the debts. After paying off his creditors, he had 10,000 yuan left, of which he gave 2,000 yuan to his debtors. He then left Harbin for Dalian and instructed his wife to also take the route through Dalian to follow him. When his wife arrived in Dalian and was about to board a ship to the south, she was suddenly detained by detectives. His young son hid in the luggage and managed to reach Qingdao. He then informed his father of what had happened. Mr. Vansber then came to Shanghai to provide assistance. After arriving in Shanghai, he reportedly received a telegram from Dalian instructing him to immediately go to Dalian so that his wife could be released. This was because he was suspected of embezzling funds from other partners in the cinema. However, in fact, his shareholding relationship with the partners in the cinema had long been settled and there was no problem at all. This was also proven by the partners. Therefore, he refused to return to Dalian. According to him, the authorities' attempt to lure him back to Dalian was because he was very familiar with various military news, so one party suspected him a lot and wanted to use his wife and children as hostages to lure him back. However, he was worried about being arrested himself, so he could not help his wife. Recently, seeing that this plan was not working, the other party released his wife and they are now reunited.</p>
<h3>Antique and Carving Workers Request Improved Treatment</h3>
<p>Submitting Three Demands, Requesting Assistance from the Party and Government</p>
<p>Da Gong News: Dozens of antique workers from San Shan living in Shanghai, including Yu Yihai, Ruan Binwang, Li Yitong, Pan Shiguan, and others, working in antique shops in the Xin Lao Bei Men area in the city, such as Huang Zhongli, Zhen Guqi, Chen Baoji, and Ruan Baoji, have been working for twelve to thirteen hours a day, leading to a difficult life. Yesterday, they submitted a petition to the party and government organs, requesting them to help improve their conditions and making three demands: 1. Antique carving is the epitome of craftsmanship. It requires meticulous work, mental effort, and causes mental and physical exhaustion. It is requested that the daily working hours be reduced to eight hours, as in ordinary factories. Sunday and national holidays should also be observed with regular rest, without deduction of wages. 2. The workers were all hired by the shop owners from afar. If they are dismissed, they should be given one month's wages to maintain their living expenses and a travel allowance of ten yuan to return home, so as to avoid being stranded in a foreign land. 3. If workers become ill and need to rest according to a doctor's diagnosis, their wages should not be arbitrarily deducted. In the event of death, the shop owners should be responsible for the funeral arrangements. It is reported that after receiving the petition, the party and government are currently sending personnel to investigate in order to verify the matter.</p>

<p>The area around Sichuan Road in the Chengbei area of Hongkou District was previously affected by rumors, and residents moved away, leading to a decline in the market and a downturn in commerce.

<h3>Cigarette and Coin Industry Association Changes Auxiliary Copper Coin Exchange Method</h3>
<p>How Much is Needed for Each Exchange, Register with the Association One Day in Advance</p>
<p>Xin Xin News: The Shanghai Cigarette and Coin Industry Association has been entrusted by the Central Bank to act as an agent for the exchange of one-cent copper auxiliary coins. It receives 55 boxes every day and distributes them to its members for exchange. Now, some members need to increase their exchange amount in each period, while others do not need to exchange. Therefore, the association has changed the exchange method to avoid surpluses or shortages. Yesterday, it issued a notice to its members stating: "Regarding the notice, this association has accepted the Central Bank's entrustment to act as an agent for the exchange of one-cent copper auxiliary coins. The original agreement stipulated that each member would exchange 100 yuan. Now, it has been found that some members need to increase their exchange amount in each period according to the original amount, while others do not need to exchange. The situation is different and the amount is difficult to calculate. Therefore, the exchange method has been changed (the exchange period is still set for every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday). From now on, if each member needs a certain amount of one-cent copper auxiliary coins, they must register with the association one day in advance starting from March 5th (ie, Friday) so that the total number of boxes can be calculated (if members do not register with the association in advance, they will be deemed to have forfeited this period). A letter will be sent to the Central Bank requesting issuance accordingly to avoid surpluses or shortages. This is a special notice. All members must comply. This is to announce."</p>

On the afternoon of the 25th of last month, detectives disguised themselves as customers and purchased a set of the above-mentioned devices at each of the two pharmacies, costing nine yuan in foreign currency. They then requested the First Special Court to issue a search warrant. At 10 a.m. on the morning of this month, they collaborated with Western detectives and first went to Da Xin. They confiscated five uterine warmers, three reproductive self-therapy devices, rubber glass bottles, 103 pieces, 120 air pumps, eight boxes and eight rubber tips, 14 boxes of Fulaigu ointment for external use, 22 boxes of contraceptive and detoxification ointment, 178 tubes of Fulaigao, seven bottles of Gujing pills, nine bottles of Xingling, 12 boxes of Sibao Linggao, and 483 copies of the "New Knowledge of Sexuality" book.

Yesterday morning, they transferred them to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Qian Xunjiu, the lawyer from the police station, stated the above situation, saying that the two pharmacies published advertisements in various newspapers, openly selling these obscene and prohibited items and aphrodisiacs, which violated Article 46, Paragraph 4 of the Prohibition and Penalty Act. He now requested that, in addition to detaining all the items seized, the Department should apply to the court to order the managers of the two pharmacies to be summoned for punishment. Judge Pan approved the deposit of all the seized items in the warehouse.</p>

<h3>A Divorce Case</h3>
<p>Wan Meiqing Requests Cohabitation - Yang Linda Did Not Arrive, Rescheduled</p>
<p>Wan Meiqing, a local from Gao Hang District in Pudong, works in a fruit shop in Shiliupu in Nanshi. He married Yang Linda, the daughter of Yang Xiaolin (also employed at Quanji Fruit Shop in Shiliupu) from the same village. The couple is the same age, married at 30 years old for twelve years, and has two sons and one daughter. The eldest son is ten years old, the second is eight years old, and the daughter is six years old. A few years ago, Wan Meiqing lost his job. She returned to her mother's house for three years. During the period, she requested a divorce, but it was not approved. Now, Wan Meiqing is requesting to cohabit with his wife in the local court, because his mother is old and his children are young, so he should return home to serve his old mother and educate his children, otherwise, his parents have the pain of having a daughter-in-law who is like no daughter-in-law, and his children become children who have a mother but are like no mother. He also pointed out that his mother-in-law was obstructing him. Yesterday, Judge Zhao opened the court. The defendant did not arrive. Lawyer Yan Baogang stated that Wan Meiqing's behavior was improper. He was suspended from his job by the shop owner and had been idle for a long time. He often ordered his wife to return to Ning and borrow money. If he did not succeed, he would beat her. On July 15, 1932, she firmly urged him to pawn clothes and exchange them for rice, but he refused and was beaten by her. Therefore, she returned to her mother's house. But Wan even rushed to the door of her mother's house, scolding her all day long, and beating her mother several times. Later, his father injured her and requested a divorce, but it was not approved. Today's lawsuit is nothing more than her mother's family being a little wealthier and regarding her as a money tree, so they are urgently forcing her to return in order to fulfill their demands. Therefore, he still requests a divorce. The official discussion was changed to a re-examination after the defendant arrived in person.</p>

<h3>United States Lawn Tennis Association Opposes Women's Davis Cup</h3>
<p>International Lawn Tennis Association to Discuss Australian Proposal</p>
<p>The Australian Lawn Tennis Association recently proposed the launch of a Women's Davis Cup competition. The International Lawn Tennis Association will discuss this proposal in Paris. However, according to Reuters, the Executive Committee of the United States Lawn Tennis Association has expressed its opposition to this proposal.</p>
<p>The United States Lawn Tennis Association will formally express its attitude after the International Association. The Executive Committee made this decision because it is rumored that the Australian proposal will be sponsored by the American representatives in the International Association. The Executive Committee's reason for opposing is that the American Lawn Tennis Association has already funded American Whitman female players to compete in England and cannot fund participation in other international competitions.</p>
<p>At the same time, on the other hand, American female players are very interested in the Australian proposal. According to American newspapers, Ms. Helber, the champion of the former Women's National Collegiate Athletic Association, supports this proposal, but it does not mean abolishing the Whitman Cup.</p>
<h3>Current Situation of West Qing Women's Volleyball</h3>
<p>Qixiu and Gong Department Girls' High School Oppose Each Other - Who Will Be the Leader Will Be Revealed on the 10th</p>
<p>Yesterday, West Qing volleyball only had two women's matches, which were irrelevant to the Chinese people. As a result, due to the closeness of the strength of each team, the battles were extremely tense. As a result, Ati Xuebai Team B lost to West Qing Black Team with a score of 28 to 45. Ati Xuebai Team A defeated Sukeer with a score of 45 to 24. One win and one loss made a group of Jewish groups cheer. The women's and men's team schedules have now been completed by half. Qixiu and the Municipal Bureau Girls' High School each maintain a virgin situation with three wins in three games, forming a confrontation. The two teams will meet on the 10th of this month, and at that time, it will be possible to determine who will be the leader. However, in terms of strength and experience, Qixiu is more confident than the Municipal Bureau Girls' High School. As for other Western teams competing with Qixiu and the Municipal Bureau Girls' High School, it is like hitting a stone with an egg. The difference in skills is truly like heaven and earth. As for the men's team A, after Haiqing narrowly beat West Qing the night before, they have formed a three-legged situation with the Russian army. What will happen in the future depends on the development results of the second cycle. Each department of Team B is still in a mixed battle period. After another week of chaos, the situation should gradually become clear. The results of yesterday's game and the recent status of Team A women's team are listed separately below.</p>
<h3>Current Status of China Youth Basketball</h3>
<p>China Youth Basketball, since the bank team has long ended, and the women's team has decided to suspend the competition, there are currently four commercial teams and two academic teams competing. Yesterday, four commercial team matches were played. Except for Ping team's abandonment of the game against Zhanghua, the rest of the games were one-sided. Although the commercial team schedule has passed halfway, it is still unclear who will be the leader. For example, the three teams of Zai Zhi Hui, Ling Dong, and Qian Chang in Commercial Team Four, and Chaoshang and Tongren in Commercial Team One have never lost since they started playing. It is expected that there will be tense battles when each team meets in the future. The results of yesterday's game and the current status of each department are recorded below.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Game Results</p>
<p>Lingdong Defeats Meizui Shi (Commercial Team Four) 39 to 17 Zhanghua Defeats Ping Team (Commercial Team Two) Ping Team Abandons You Team Defeats Nanshui (Commercial Team Two) 42 to 24 Tongren Defeats Hezhong (Commercial Team One) 47 to 8</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Joint Meeting of Training Directors of Universities and Colleges in the City Convened by the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Banning Dancing for University Students Begins with Military Management: Director Pan's Address Emphasizes Paying Attention to Students' Thoughts and Actions</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened a joint meeting of training directors from universities and colleges at the YMCA on Baixianqiao at 2 PM yesterday. Director Pan personally attended and delivered a speech, and important issues were discussed. Details are as follows. Attendees included Director Pan of the Social Affairs Bureau, Section Chief of the Fifth Section,</p>
<p>Attendees</p>
<p>Jiang Jianbai, Commissioner and Director of the Training Section Liu Xuru, staff members Zhang Ruli and Chen Dongbai, and training directors from various universities: Chen Jiaxun from Jiaotong University, Wu Xiu from Jinan University, Cheng Pinwen from Tongji University, Hu Qibing from Guanghua University, Shi Yukai from Daxia University, Lin Guofang from Shanghai University, Wang Jingkan from Zhendan University, Guan Shizhi from Datong University, Xu Tiansui from Southeast University, Cheng Dexu from Fudan University, Zhou Chengen from Soochow University, Lao Mengshao from Chihchih University, Zhu Yingpeng from the School of Commerce, Lu Yunbo from the Sino-French Institute of Technology, Yu Bingquan from Tongde University, Zhu Ying from the National Conservatory of Music, Zhu Shuqing from Shanghai Medical College, Zhao Zhu from the Municipal Sports College, Hu Youren from Zhengfeng College, Cao Xinhan from the Law School, Wang Yuanbo from the Art School, Zheng Cuie from the Women's Medical College, and Wang Zhensong from the Political Science and Law College, totaling more than 30 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The meeting began with a report from Chairman Jiang, the Section Chief, who stated that the Social Affairs Bureau considers the training of students in Shanghai's schools at all levels to be very important. A discussion meeting for middle schools was held last week. Today, universities are invited to jointly discuss this matter, so that Shanghai's schools can have a relatively unified method for training, promote each other, and benefit greatly. He hopes that everyone will report the difficulties in implementing training in their respective schools for reference and improvement. Here are a few points that the administrative organs hope to report regarding the principles of training: ㊀ Regarding the training policy, it is hoped that in the future, emphasis will be placed on active guidance and less on passive management. ㊁ Regarding training work, it is hoped that the president and faculty will jointly take responsibility, so that training and teaching can be integrated. ㊂ Regarding the leadership of students' thoughts, it is hoped that more attention will be paid to it. Secondly, as an additional report, the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau are jointly organizing a liaison meeting for outstanding students from universities and colleges to encourage outstanding students. It is hoped that each school will select students with excellent achievements in intelligence, morality, and physical fitness to participate.</p>
<p>Director's Address</p>
<p>Next, Director Pan delivered a speech, stating that ㊀ the joint training meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau is different from ordinary meetings. It is of a discussion and consultation nature, held once at the beginning and end of each semester, and can also be convened temporarily when necessary. Regarding procedures, the Social Affairs Bureau will first collect simple training reports and proposals from each school before the meeting, and distribute the proposals to each school in advance to prepare opinions, so that the discussion can be smoother during the meeting. ㊁ Regarding the training director's attention to students' thoughts and actions, the government hopes that young people will take the right path. Perhaps due to the complexity of the social environment and various temptations such as reactionary publications, students may inadvertently go astray. The role of training is to enable those who have gone astray to turn back. If they cannot turn back and become a troublemaker for the whole school, they will of course be expelled or otherwise punished. But the best way is to start from the positive side and prevent students from being tempted by improper routes. Judging from the current situation, the situation may be better than in the past, because the Communist Party recently expressed its abandonment of armed rebellion and class struggle, but whether its expression is sincere is still a problem. Perhaps it is only on the surface, and in reality, it is still the same as in the past, so schools cannot but consider it in advance. According to recent reports, the secret resolution of the National Salvation Association does not accept the Communist Party's expression, that is, class struggle is still to be advocated, and rebellion is still necessary when necessary. It can be proved that the Communist Party cannot command its related groups and elements as it wishes. Therefore, even if the senior Communist Party personnel change their policies, it is inevitable that their affiliated elements will still not change. Therefore, all of you who are responsible for the training of students in schools must pay attention to the students' thoughts and actions at all times and must not slack off, otherwise, there is still a fear of unexpected events occurring.</p>
<p>Latinized Chinese Characters</p>
<p>Recently, the Communist Party wants to use Latinized Chinese characters, that is, the so-called New Writing Movement, to promote communism. Everyone should pay attention. The so-called Latinized Chinese characters are a resolution of the Third International Eastern Conference. On the surface, it is an excuse that Chinese characters are difficult to learn, so it promotes Latinization. Its actual role is to promote its doctrine, because propaganda in Chinese characters is easy to be inspected, while propaganda in Latin letters can be concealed. Therefore, Latinized Chinese characters are a secret symbol for the Communist Party to promote its doctrine. It is hoped that each school will conduct a general inspection of books and absolutely prohibit the existence of such books. In the past, some students held voluntary schools in schools and taught with this kind of textbook. In fact, it is useless for ordinary people to learn Latin characters, because what is commonly used is not Latin characters. Therefore, the role of teaching Latin characters is not for the convenience of literacy, but to promote communism. If this kind of writing is successful, the biggest bad result will be the division of China, because the biggest force for the unification of China is the unification of writing. Latin letters use the pronunciation of local dialects. If each uses the pronunciation of dialects, even if Latin letters are learned, they still cannot be fully understood. In the future, China will become like Europe, and the unity of writing will be completely destroyed. Therefore, Latinized Chinese characters should not exist in culture. It is hoped that everyone will pay close attention.</p>
<p>Uniform Issue</p>
<p>㊂ Regarding military management, it is hoped that in this semester, students can all wear uniforms. This has been completely achieved in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and Nanjing City. The reason why Shanghai has not been able to achieve this is entirely due to inertia. I think it may be more difficult for primary school students to wear uniforms, because many parents of primary school students in rural areas are indeed not financially capable enough, but the parents of students in universities and colleges are definitely not financially problematic. If the school can make a decision that students who do not wear uniforms will not be allowed to enter the school, I think students will have to wear them. Currently, it is entirely the school's concern, relaxing students, and students naturally have many excuses. At the same time, if teachers and staff can set an example, students will definitely be more willing to follow. The same is true for shaving their heads. If the school can enforce it, there is nothing that cannot be done. I hope everyone will make a decision and implement it strictly, because wearing uniforms is the basic condition for military management and neatness. If this can be achieved, other problems can be easily solved.</p>
<p>Discussion of Proposals</p>
<p>㊀ How to strictly implement military management and promote the militarization of student life? It was resolved that schools that have already implemented it should step up promotion and strive for universalization throughout the school. Schools that have not implemented it should set up and implement it within this semester. ㊁ How to implement compulsory sports, with each student participating in at least one event when holding sports meets, so that the physical development of students is universalized? It was resolved that schools that have not done so should promote and implement it as much as possible to reduce championship sports and cultivate a general sports atmosphere. ㊂ How to increase student academic research and technical practice group activities, such as Mandarin and English speaking clubs and debates? It was resolved to support and guide those that already exist and try to promote those that have not been established. ㊃ How to prohibit students from dancing? It was resolved to find a way to thoroughly implement military management (such as wearing uniforms, shaving heads, and restricting entry and exit times) as an indirect method to prohibit students from dancing. ㊄ How to make all students wear uniforms to change the decadent and romantic style of university students? It was resolved that the first step is to ensure that students must wear uniforms for classes and exercises on campus, and teachers and staff should start practicing and set an example, and seek to contact the parents of students, so that students can first pay for the uniform fees. ㊅ How to stipulate the standard expenses for students each semester and cooperate with parents to implement economic restrictions to change the extravagant and romantic habits of university students? It was resolved that each school should adopt and implement it as much as possible. ㊆ How to implement employment guidance and provide training in applied knowledge in the last semester before graduation? It was resolved that in addition to establishing graduate job placement agencies, each school should also try to provide guidance on employment skills. ㊇ Temporary motion: This meeting will continue to be convened by the Social Affairs Bureau in the future, so that the training directors of each school can exchange discussion cases. It was resolved and passed.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Yarn Flower and Yarn Market Plunges Violently</h3>
<p>Sales of Spot Yarn Stagnate Across the Board, Qingdao Yarn and Cloth Tend Downstream, Bulls Forced to Liquidate in Bulk, Reaching Recent Low Prices</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending weak, and the plunge is rampant, mainly because the actual demand for spot yarn has stalled. All merchants, during this peak spring season, show no signs of growth. At the same time, Qingdao yarn and cloth market prices are tending downstream, leading to fear and panic. Two major firms from the Jinzi gang are liquidating large amounts of wholesale orders, causing the market to decline further. Another theory is that Japanese yarn factories are operating at full capacity, and each bale of yarn still has a profit of several tens of yuan. Therefore, when the market price weakens, more people are selling spot goods. However, some still hold a wait-and-see attitude, deeply fearing that the delivery of spot yarn will be delayed, and the future remains to be seen, still focusing on actual demand.</p>
<h3>Traded Yarn Plummets by Three and a Half Yuan Across All Months</h3>
<p>The traded yarn market opened with a slight increase of one cent for the current month, but the distant months all showed a downward trend. The market surface was loose, and overseas yarn flowers consistently rose, but local sentiment remained weak. This is because the spot yarn business is sluggish, and during this peak spring season, purchases by various merchants are still sparse. Furthermore, the prices of yarn from other ports are not good, so actual buyers are unusually active, facing heavy pressure. By the three o'clock closing, the plunge was even more intense, reaching new low prices seen recently. As a result, the closing prices for traded yarn were down by one yuan and six to eight cents to two yuan and one cent compared to the previous day's closing. After the afternoon opening, Dachangcheng suddenly dumped heavily, and for a time the cotton market was unable to support it, and the plunge was extremely severe. Each month fell by one yuan. After one round of trading, it was heard that yarn sales were weak, with only 600 bales traded. Speculators, seeing the bad environment, generally forced liquidation, breaking the 35 yuan mark for the distant months. After the traded yarn market closed, each month fell again by one yuan and three, seven, and eight cents compared to the morning closing price. Sales included: Tonghe - 1,150 bales, Jinghua 1,350 bales, Yuanyi 3,350 bales, Daji 1,000 bales, Yukang 1,100 bales, Dafeng 1,000 bales, Taixing 1,450 bales, Gengfeng 4,050 bales, Senkang 2,400 bales, Renfeng 2,850 bales, Wangtai Yu 3,200 bales, Dachangcheng 5,850 bales, Runkang 1,500 bales, Dachang 1,510 bales. Purchases included: Yichang 2,700 bales, Dafu 1,450 bales, Meiji 1,400 bales, Juyu 1,100 bales, Hengyi 4,500 bales, Yuda 1,150 bales, Hexing 2,900 bales, Ruida 2,750 bales, Yicheng 1,900 bales, Changfeng 1,600 bales, Baxincheng 1,600 bales, Xiesheng 1,150 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Sales Only Reach 600 Odd Bales</h3>
<p>Spot yarn sales have turned sluggish. According to statistics, various merchants purchased a total of 661 bales throughout the day. The selling price fell by 2.3 yuan, and the thread fell by 6.7 yuan. The purchase amounts for each merchant are as follows.</p>
<h3>Divergence Between Chinese and Foreign Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>Ample Cotton Stocks, Miserable Cotton Yarn Plunge, Going Long Seems Not Yet the Time</p>
<p>The cotton market is also weak, affected by the yarn market and dragged into its vortex. However, American cotton continues to rise, and Indian cotton is also firm. However, local sentiment has not been boosted in the slightest. This is because yarn sales are sluggish, and factory stocks are also sufficient. Therefore, the market looks even more tired and weak. However, its decline seems to be more moderate than that of cotton yarn. The reason is that foreign cotton has been rising for consecutive days, and those who have shorted the market are somewhat worried.</p>
<h3>Traded Cotton Flowers Drop by Four Cents Throughout the Day</h3>
<p>The traded cotton flower market opened with a slightly better price of five cents for the current month, but the distant months fell. However, American and Indian cotton unanimously continued to rise, but the market situation was not affected in any way. Currently, the desire to sell among traders is unusually strong because each warehouse has sufficient cotton, and factory demand is not strong. Therefore, although foreign cotton has been rising for consecutive days, it still cannot arouse people's desire to go long. As a result, the closing prices for each month of traded cotton flowers were down by half a cent to three cents compared to the previous day's closing. After the afternoon opening, the decline was also strong due to the impact of the yarn market, but the trend became more stable later. This is because the target of general speculators is concentrated on traded yarn, and the tendency to short traded cotton flowers is weakening. As a result, each month fell again by one cent to one and a half cents compared to the morning closing price. Sales included: Dafeng, Yide 1,300 dan, Hexing 2,100 dan, Gengfeng 3,800 dan, Dachangcheng 3,100 dan, Runkang 6,200 dan, Dachang 1,100 dan, Fukang 4,500 dan, Yongda 1,500 dan, Tonghe 1,900 dan, Yuanyu Chang 4,000 dan. Purchases included: Jifeng 2,600 dan, Chengji 1,000 dan, Changji 100 dan, Hengyi 1,400 dan, Yuda 3,800 dan, Zhenda 2,400 dan, Ruida 1,500 dan, Yuaner 2,100 dan, Taichang 1,100 dan, Changhe 9,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices for the day are listed on the left.</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Factories Purchase Fine Cotton</h3>
<p>Although the consumption of spot cotton is not very smooth, each factory still has a continuous purchase of fine cotton. The sources have not been heard.</p>
<h3>The Selling Camp of Traded Yarn is Expanding</h3>
<p>Since the Indian merchants manipulated the traded yarn market of the Chinese Business Yarn and Cloth Exchange and squeezed the short positions of the February contract last year, due to the continuous increase in yarn stocks in the factories and the sluggish spring sales, the market price has recently fallen. The amount of traded yarn in account has also increased. As of January 1st, there was a sharp increase of 119,550 bales compared to the 578,500 bales at the end of last year. The price change is expanding with the increase of long and short positions. The turnover for March was 206,350 bales, the turnover for April was 269,450 bales, the turnover for May was 184,750 bales, and the turnover for June was 27,500 bales, totaling 688,050 bales. After netting long and short positions, the net balance was 86,550 bales. The transaction amounts of major buyers and sellers are extracted below (unit: bales).</p>
<h3>Traded Yarn Selling Camp</h3>
<h3>Traded Yarn Buying Camp</h3>
<h3>Recent American Cotton is Particularly Popular</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with mixed conditions. Prices for each month ranged from a decrease of two pounds to an increase of two pounds. In the early morning, traders and foreign merchants bought in. News from Liverpool was good, and spot cotton was firm, so the market rose. Later, bulls liquidated and cotton farmers hedged sales. Buyers hesitated, and sentiment reversed. The market price rebounded slightly. Ten delivery notices for the March contract have been absorbed by a major spot trader, and local sellers have also been covering their positions. Before the closing, due to the strength of the stock market, traders bought in large quantities, and the closing was extremely firm. Spot prices rose by ten pounds, and futures rose by three to sixteen pounds. English cotton spot prices rose by eight points, and futures rose by one point to a decrease of two points. Indian cotton initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and short covering, but then rebounded due to bull liquidation and cotton farmer hedging.

<h3>Piece Goods and Cotton Cloth Purchased Only When Urgently Needed</h3>
<p>Eastern Goods and Fine Cloth Fall Sharply, Stocks Accumulate Rapidly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cotton cloth market was characterized by a sharp drop in yarn prices and cold, rainy weather, resulting in a transitional period for retail sales. All parties were sluggish in their buying intentions, and purchases were postponed unless they were urgently needed, resulting in a gradual increase in stocks. The Qinghao Tianjin cloth market is also showing a declining trend, and sentiment is depressed. Eastern goods and fine cloth are falling sharply, and retailers are selling off as much as possible. The leading fine cloth futures are falling the most severely, down one cent per piece compared to the evening market the day before. The upper grades, such as Wufu and Flying Fish, are also down one cent. Mid-grade brands, such as Yanghe, Colorful Ball, and Jixiang, fell by one and a half cents. Qingdao goods fell by five cents. The market is chaotic. Dyeing factories and colored cloth stores took advantage of the slack factory prices to absorb nearly 1,000 pieces of futures. However, spot goods are still not strong, and the decline is also more moderate. Eastern goods fine twill fell by five cents, and the decline of fine twill from local factories was also fierce, falling by more than five cents to one cent per piece. Due to the high demand for civic training, wholesale stores on this street purchased more than 100 bales of white twill, and gangs from the Yangtze River, Hunan, Anhui, etc., also purchased more than 100 pieces of fine twill, and more than 200 boxes of blue cloth, Shilin cloth, and colored twill.</p>
<h3>Woolen Goods Enjoy Brisk Arrivals and Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the woolen goods market was good. Foreign firms were delivering their orders, especially Western-style goods, which surpassed ordinary goods. Wholesale households in cargo dismantling shops and the chessboard street area were paying taxes and delivering goods, which were increasing daily. In terms of sales, Western-style suit materials are currently the most popular. Thick wool gabardine, long-lasting wool, Hamilton striped thin flannel, and Chongshi Paodeke Si Hailisi, etc., have all seen large transactions in recent days. The trend at the public tea party is quite good, and the standards of all goods are firm and opaque.</p>
<h3>Financial Jewish Merchants Speculate on Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>Selling Japanese Exchange to Settle in US Dollars</p>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange market was extremely stable due to the efforts of banks to reconcile. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that both near and distant London major currencies rose by 0.0625. The New York silver market did not move.

<h3>Traded Gold is Unpredictable</h3>

The Central Bank's listed price showed that the British pound and the US dollar were flat. The sea customs gold unit did not move. The standard traded gold price was reduced to 1156.4 yuan.

<p>The morning opening was 115.5 yuan, a decrease compared to the previous closing. Dafeng Heng Qiafeng Yong Na Tia rose to 6 yuan. HSBC listed the British pound and the US dollar as flat.

<h3>Securities and Public Debt, Winter Bears Are Already Emerging</h3>
<p>Grade A Falls Six Cents, the Most</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of the Chinese Business Securities Exchange gradually turned weak. The appetite of the multi-party was obviously satisfied. The rumors were nothing more than castles in the air. People in the financial world had bought in before, and now a large number of people in the financial world are selling out. The multi-party of numbers 43, 47, and 77 are emerging one after another. The market price falling by more than one yuan from the peak was also expected. In the current market situation, if major investors do not sell out, there is still a possibility of maneuvering. After yesterday's opening, numbers 43 and 40 immediately sold out, and the market price immediately felt weak, one or two cents lower. Later, numbers 3 and 4 bought in grades A and B, so it was only five cents and one cent lower. The next round continued to shrink, and number 77 sold out, and numbers 3, 4, and 5 still bought in, and the market price fell again by five cents to one cent to three cents. After the afternoon opening, retail investors also sold out, and trading was relatively light, continuing to shrink by one or two cents. Only far-reaching Grade A goods closed well by more than five cents, and were still five cents and one cent lower. As a result, the market prices all decreased by three to five cents. Only Grade A for the current month decreased by six cents, the most. The total transaction volume was 5.135 million yuan. The result of the increase or decrease is compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Food, Many Sell Off, Flour Falls by About Four Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, the market for each month showed signs of initial stability followed by a decline. The quoted price of foreign wheat in Chicago was nearly 2 cents better, and the distant price was 8 cents better. Canada was 11 cents better. Although the market sentiment saw the foreign wheat increase after the opening, the recent actual sales of large firms were still resolved at par. It was said that the foreign wheat previously ordered by the factories had already been imported, so the customer sentiment was not good, and many outside parties were selling off. Each month then fell by three cents. At the afternoon opening, the transactions for each month were extremely light. Near-term competition between long and short parties was powerless. In the long run, the new flour did not attract the attention of most people, falling one or two cents more than in the morning. According to market sentiment, if actual sales do not improve, the near-term will tend to be weak.</p>
<h3>Futures Wheat Also Falls</h3>
<p>Australian Wheat Continues to be Imported, Raw Material Supply Increases</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market gradually loosened and fell. The quoted price of foreign wheat continued to be 8 cents to 12 cents better. However, the weather had already cleared, and the Australian wheat ordered by the local factories had recently been imported one after another, and the supply of raw materials seemed to be increasing, so sentiment was flat and purchases were very quiet. Compared to the previous day, it was 11 cents lower. Until the afternoon opening, the near-month multi-party also took advantage of the slump in the flour market to sell off, and the decline was more severe. The rest also continued to fall by three or four cents. The spot wheat market remained stable, with a small amount of arrivals. Customer sentiment was tight. The opening price for Shaoxing Guide wheat was 6.6 yuan, and the price for foreign river Chao wheat was 6.1 yuan. The total market was 2,000 bags of transactions.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants Purchase More Than 30,000 Bags of Ke Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Guangdong merchants' handling of Ke Xian rice was even more prosperous, with more than 20,000 bags handled throughout the day. The purchase volume of brown rice was even greater. However, the processed rice was still embellished by the oil heads in this street, and the market was also firm and lively. Moreover, the Guangdong market still has a strong appetite, and there may be a realization of large-scale purchases in the future, so the sentiment is still continuing to look good. Yesterday, the spot price of brown rice rose sharply, and the price of processed rice also rose by nearly one cent. 13,278 bags of Jiangxi rice, 11,600 bags of Hunan rice, and 1,400 bags of Hansha brown rice were opened.</p>
<h3>Rice Markets in Hexia All Fell</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 gangs and sources, with a total of 1,600 to 1,700 shi of goods. Among them, more than 10 were thin rice, Chenzhou brand, which was still sold. The Xi'an Qingdao gang handled about 1,000 bags, and the sales market in this street was also sluggish, so the market situation was flat and weak, and the prices of both thick and thin japonica rice were revised by a few points. Du Yangjian was soft, and Yinyuan was flat.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, various sources from Hexia were 2,600 to 2,700, and the various methods of distribution on the market were still light. The price of white japonica rice fell by a small number of cents to one cent, the price of thin rice was weak by three to five cents, the price of early rice was difficult and short by five or six cents, the price of variant yuan fell by nearly one cent, and the price shapes of various indica rices and other goods all showed weakness.</p>
<h3>Soybean Sales Turn Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market was not affected by the decline in Dalian. On the contrary, the market was lively, and the sentiment was active. The good thing was that sales continued to be active, and the price was able to rise by one to three cents. If Dalian does not fall again in the future and the local demand can continue, it may not be surprising that the sentiment is not affected. Yesterday, the Shanzha oil factory and the inland car workshop sauce garden workshop sold four oil heads, Xiamen Ben Chong and other transactions. Yingzhou beans had seven or eight cars, Bengbu beans had three cars, Kaiyuan bean market, Linzhun Guan beans had two cars, Dangshan beans had one car, Tancheng beans had one car, Zhunqiu beans had 300 bags, Chongming Sha Huang had more than 700 bags, Hankou Zha beans had 1,600 to 1,700 bags, and Chi beans had more than 300 bags.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Can Still Support in the Near Future</h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the standard soybean spot sales turned active and the sentiment returned to stability, the arrivals were even more abundant, and the train arrivals were also abundant. The only way out was the factory households. Although the Lian city reported a small amount, avoiding the southward flow of Lian beans. Therefore, the standard beans were 45 cents less. The Lian city of oil cake was in a revolving situation, and the subsequent market lacked momentum for improvement. The industry customers had spit out, but the cake sales were active, and it could still support in the near future. The distant day continues to see a small decline of one cent. It is estimated that sample oil is also 5 cents to 1 cent less.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea, February Japanese and American Silk Prices Fall</h3>
<p>The Main Reason is the Decline in New York's Actual Sales</p>
<p>In February, the international silk market gradually loosened and weakened. The recent futures price of New York Standard Silk fell from 2.005 yuan (February 1 market price) to 1.835 yuan (February 17 market price). The deferred period fell from 2.0-5 yuan to 1.83 yuan, an average decrease of 0.1775 yuan, equivalent to a decrease of 78.87 yuan per dan in the Shanghai market. At the same time, Yokohama also saw a decline, with the spot silk price at the beginning of the month being 910 yuan, and only 867 yuan at the end of the month. The futures price fell from 884 yuan to 826 yuan, a total decrease of 43 yuan for the former and 58 yuan for the latter. The main reason for the decline was the decline in the sale of raw silk in New York in February. According to the total amount of raw silk used in this month, it was 3,8484 packages, a huge decrease of 5,7-4 packages compared to January. Since the beginning of spring, the Shanghai silk market has been silent for a long time, and prices have also been gradually decreasing, reaching 40-50 yuan. Now, looking at the statistics of New York raw silk, the stock of Shanghai silk in the United States has suddenly increased by 1,649 packages, which is more than half compared to January, resulting in the situation of poor exports for more than a month. The statistics are listed below to show the status of the distribution and collection of American raw silk in February (unit: dan).</p>
<h3>Hubei and Hunan Black Tea Implement Unified Control</h3>
<p>The total production and sales of Hubei and Hunan black tea in Hankou last year was 117,000 boxes. Although tea shops and tea lines have been used to promote sales of this tea in Hankou, the scope of tea-making shops is extremely large. Therefore, the funds required by each shop, in addition to the fund, are mostly directly borrowed from the silver and money industry in Hankou. Last year, Hubei and Hunan black tea sales were very slow due to the sharp increase in production of Ceylon, Haowan, and other teas. The market price fell again and again, and the tea merchants suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the money industry in Hankou is afraid to lend to the tea industry this year. Therefore, Hubei and Hunan tea merchants have petitioned the Hunan and Hubei authorities to request loans for relief. It is heard that the two provinces have complied with the request of the tea merchants, and plan to imitate the transportation and sales methods of Anhui and Jiangxi black tea, and organize a sales agency in Hankou to handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Hardware, White Lead Skin Fixed Price Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Recently, white lead skin has been stockpiled by the industry and purchased by manufacturers, so there is not much supply on the market. The market price is as high as 96 yuan per barrel. The opening price yesterday was estimated to be 180 yuan for No. 2, 175-6 yuan for No. 3, 172 yuan for No. 5, 170 yuan for No. 5, 169 yuan for No. 6, 165 yuan for No. 7, 162 yuan for No. 8, and 160 yuan for No. 9. Thick color was estimated to be 155 yuan to 160 yuan. The transaction reached 200-300 barrels, mostly sold by the hardware stores in the area of ​​North Suzhou Road and the industry in the French Concession. However, the overseas fixed price yesterday showed a rising trend again. For example, the market price per ton was 36 pounds, a huge increase of 2 pounds compared to the previous one, which made the mood of those with goods even tighter.</p>
<h3>Brass Strip Raises by More Than Five Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas brass strip market price rose by five and a half pounds, estimated at 67.5 pounds per ton. 48 tons were purchased by the industry in the Broadway area. It is heard that the overseas stock is very small after that, so the situation in the back market is very optimistic.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market, Guangdong Sugar Sold Out More Than 1,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be soft. The association's plan was 24 coarse sand white spot price 22.8 yuan, down 5 cents, re-export 7.34 yuan, sales were transacted, Dongbai also fell by 1.5 to 5 cents, estimated 4-white spot price 22.8 yuan, re-export 7.8 yuan, 8th was 22.5 yuan, re-export 7.55 yuan, YRO mark 22.4 yuan, re-export 7.3 yuan, all lacked transactions.</p>
<p>The Sugar Industry Joint Company reached the period for bidding for Guangdong sugar yesterday, estimated to be a total of 1,390 bags, such as 240 bags of coarse sand white from Shunde Factory, priced at 22.6 yuan, and 1,150 bags of Huizhou second, all passed through.</p>

<h3>匡衡凿壁偷光</h3>
<p>— Zhang Xiuya</p>
<p>—Because he studied hard as a child, he became a great Confucian scholar when he grew up—</p>
<p>The sun went down, the sky gradually darkened, and the twilight was like a piece of gray gauze as thin as cicada wings, gently covering the bright eyes of the small river and the verdant mountains in front of the door. The deep blue sky, like an autumn suburban garden, was dotted with small star-like yellow flowers. They twinkled and sparkled, as crystal clear as sharp dewdrops.</p>
<p>The edges of the tiled eaves gradually became unclear... In front of the wooden fence gate, those bright red herbaceous jasmine flowers planted beside the fence had also turned into dark purple sunset colors in the dim twilight. Gradually, the petals, the leaves... were all submerged in the black waves of the night, and could no longer be seen clearly...</p>
<p>Sitting by the window, Xiao Kuang Heng, who was reading aloud, was enjoying his reading very much, when suddenly it was as if someone had spilled a splash of black ink on the page, and the words on the book became hazy and blurred. He widened his eyes, but he could not distinguish the strokes. He closed the book, frowned, and sighed softly with a pout:</p>
<p>"Why does it get dark so quickly?" As he spoke, he walked lightly to the table, raised his feet, stretched his neck to look at the tin lamp. He saw that the lamp bowl was so dry that there wasn't even a drop of oil left, and a short lamp wick, like a fish out of water, was lying there dry and scorched. He turned his head back dejectedly, held the door frame with both hands, and looked up at the tip of the tall elm tree in the courtyard! Today is the thirtieth, and the moon will not come out either... He stretched out his thin hand, scratched his scalp and said: What should I do? There is no moon tonight either... I can't read the book:" He lowered his head and walked back into the room, sat at the table, and felt very sad in his heart.</p>
<p>Mother came over, lovingly kissed his forehead and said, "Henger, what's wrong? Are you tired from reading? Come, let Mom tell you a story, how about telling you a story about Grandma Wolf?"</p>
<p>It really surprised his mother! This child was holding his chin in his hands, without saying a word, only shaking his head slightly. His small head covered with black hair was drooping, as if he had a great worry in his heart. He looked even sadder than when his favorite kitten was bitten to death by a dog. She thought that he must have overworked his brain all day and felt tired, so he didn't have the energy to speak, so she walked to the edge of the kang, gently knocked on the edge of the kang with her hand and said to him:</p>
<p>"The chickens are on the架(jia, perches), the sparrows have entered their nests, and there is no work to be done when the sun is gone. Henger, it's dark, come to the kang and lie down and rest, get up earlier tomorrow and read again. You can't see anything in the dark at this time, what are you doing holding that book foolishly?"</p>
<p>Kuang Heng was still sitting on the stool in a daze, he didn't hear his mother's words at all.</p>
<p>"Tap, tap, tap..." Suddenly a rhythmic sound came clearly from next door. It was Granny Wang starting to weave her cloth after dinner.</p>
<p>Sitting at the table like a dull little wooden puppet, Kuang Heng, upon hearing this sound, jumped up happily and clapped his hands, murmuring and cheering:</p>
<p>"I got it, I got it. Granny Wang next door hasn't gone to sleep yet, I'll borrow her lamplight to read my book."</p>
<p>He jumped onto the kang like a lively little white rabbit, and squeezed into his mother's arms. He said happily:</p>
<p>"Mom: I have an idea... Where's our firewood chopping axe?"</p>
<p>The old woman didn't understand what the child was saying at all, and stroked his soft black hair and said:</p>
<p>"Silly child, what tricks are you going to play in the dark?! I don't even know where the axe and clock have been thrown after not being used for so many days."</p>
<p>He quickly slipped off the kang. He looked around frantically and excitedly, grabbing here and there, looking for the axe everywhere. For a while, he burrowed his small body into the kang hole to fumble for a long time, and for a while he squatted down by the woodpile in the corner of the room and rummaged through it. Later, he found the axe behind a lame table, and he was so happy that he jumped up and down. He clenched the heavy axe in his small hand and hit the south wall with a "bang". A crack appeared in the yellow mud wall in response, and many debris fell down.</p>
<p>His mother didn't know what he was doing, so she hurried forward, grabbed his torn sleeve, and stopped him, saying, "Senseless Henger! What are you doing! Are you going to tear down the house?"</p>
<p>The clever little child tilted his head and smiled mischievously:</p>
<p>"Mom! Don't worry! You'll understand in a moment, I'll keep it from you for now, and tease you for a while."</p>
<p>His mother knew that he was not usually a naughty child, and there must be a reason for him to do this. So she stopped interfering with him and stood quietly aside to see him swing the axe.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang! He gritted his teeth and chiseled a few more times with difficulty. In the darkness, he touched the flat wall with his small palm, and a large piece had already been recessed. He chiseled down again with force...</p>
<p>How happy he was!—He had chiseled a small hole in the wall, and a little bit of yellowish lamplight, like a spark shining on the treetops, penetrated the wall...</p>
<p>He smiled slightly and chiseled a few more times, and the wall was chiseled through into a hole one foot square, and a beam of bright light shone straight through, like a shining golden sword.</p>
<p>The neighbor's woman was very surprised by the strange behavior of this little child, and asked him through the hole:</p>
<p>"Henger, what are you doing!"</p>
<p>The little child, upon hearing the question, thought that the neighbor suspected that he was digging a hole to steal something, and his pale face suddenly turned red, and his bright eyes flashed with tears, and he said with a sob:</p>
<p>"Auntie, I don't have money to buy oil for the lamp... That's why I'm digging a hole to borrow a little of your lamplight... to read my book. If I don't do this, I won't be able to read tonight... In this small dark room, there is no way for me to see the words in the book..." At this moment, he stretched out his small fingers, which were sore and painful from exhaustion. He gently rubbed the swollen fingertips, and felt sad for a while, and couldn't help but shed tears.</p>
<p>The woman comforted him gently, "You are really a hardworking child, don't be sad anymore, go get your book and read!" At this time, his mother, who had been standing aside in a daze, also understood why her son wanted to chisel through the wall. She was sad and happy at the same time, and held his small palm tightly, unable to say a word...</p>
<p>He took the book from the table, moved a small wooden bench, turned his face to the wall, so that the lamplight shone on the pages of the book, and began to read softly. At this time, a smile floated on his small face with tears.</p>
<h3>George Westinghouse, Inventor of the Westinghouse Air Brake</h3>
<p>— Xie Dehong</p>
<p>Westinghouse was born in the countryside of New York on September 6, 1846. His father ran a farm implement manufacturing shop, employing a dozen or so craftsmen, who worked all day long. Westinghouse helped with odd jobs in the shop and did not get to rest until late at night every day.</p>
<p>Once, he was ordered by his father to go to Boston, where he witnessed the following tragedy:</p>
<p>One night, near a small station along the Boston and New York railway line, a wagon loaded with goods was trudging along the tracks, and the exhausted, thin horse seemed to be unable to be driven any further. At this time, a fast train came speeding along like a bolt of lightning. Although some pedestrians waved signals at the speeding train to make it stop immediately, and others helped to push the wagon, it was like a dragonfly trying to shake a stone pillar, and it didn't move at all.</p>
<p>At that moment, the wagon and the train were only seventy or eighty zhang apart (approximately 70-80 meters), and if the fast train was brought to a sudden stop using a manual chain brake, it would take at least two hundred zhang (approximately 200 meters) or so. Looking at it this way, stopping the train was absolutely impossible. In the blink of an eye, there was a loud crash, and the wagon was shattered.</p>
<p>After personally witnessing this tragedy, Westinghouse was very sad and was determined to invent a completely effective braking system, and the idea lingered in his mind day and night.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he was the son of an ironworker, which gave him an advantage. He was able to forge ironware himself, without having to rely on others, so he began to manufacture what he had planned. At first, he planned to use steam as the power for the brake, but after thinking about it again and again, he felt it was inappropriate, but other than that, there was no other good method, so he changed to a plan to use a very small amount of steam to generate a very large braking force.</p>
<p>One day, when he was throwing iron into the furnace to melt it, a girl selling magazines suddenly asked him, "Sir, would you like to buy one?" Westinghouse didn't want to buy one, but the girl continued to plead, "I'm short of tuition, so I'm selling some magazines during the holidays, please help me." When Westinghouse heard this, he felt very sorry for her and bought one at random and put it aside.</p>
<p>Great achievements often originate from extremely small things, like Newton seeing an apple falling down and elucidating the theory of universal gravitation; Watt seeing the plain and unremarkable hot water being lifted up by boiling and inventing the steam engine. Now our Mr. Westinghouse also succeeded unintentionally.</p>
<p>It was truly coincidental, Westinghouse finished his work and was just about to sleep when he suddenly thought of looking at the magazine he had just bought. At first, it was just to relieve the boredom, but he unexpectedly discovered the following news:</p>
<p>"The construction of the large tunnel on the Swiss Alps Railway is using the power of compressed air, which is still a pioneering achievement in the world."</p>
<p>Originally, Westinghouse had racked his brains and searched his mind, but he had never even dreamed of compressed air. This time, he accidentally saw this piece of news, and one can imagine how much he cherished it.</p>
<p>So he designed it carefully. He wholeheartedly wanted to apply compressed air to his machinery. This uninterrupted experimental work continued for more than three months, and finally in the summer of 1868, he successfully manufactured the first air brake.</p>
<p>Such an unprecedented invention, according to normal reasoning, should have been welcomed by his parents and praised by others, but in fact, our Mr. Westinghouse was not. At first, he not only did not receive people's belief and honor, but even his father regarded it indifferently. When Westinghouse advised his father to change the current factory to specialize in manufacturing this new invention, he was initially rejected. He had to raise funds himself to do it. He wanted to develop on a large scale and discuss with the president of the largest iron company in the United States—New York Central Iron Company. But because he had never been famous, the president refused to meet him. Later, due to repeated visits, he was given a conversation limited to five minutes. Westinghouse then stated how his invention was organized, how effective it was, and finally explained his purpose, but the president laughed at him greatly and went back to his desk, ignoring whatever he said.</p>
<p>Although Westinghouse was frustrated again and again, he was confident that his invention had great efficacy. He never gave up and continued to run around and promote it everywhere. Soon, he was indeed supported by the steel magnate Carnegie and his friends, and he got the opportunity to experiment.</p>
<p>During the experiment, the train was running at full speed and invited technicians and experts from various railway companies to visit. At that time, it was October 1868, and Westinghouse was only twenty-two years old!</p>
<p>Although Westinghouse had full faith in the inventions he had made, he couldn't help but feel uneasy because they had never been tested once. He originally planned to test it when he arrived at the station, but it happened that a farmer was pushing a large cart full of grain on the tracks. At this time, the driver was driving at full speed, and the distance between the two sides was less than ten zhang (approximately 10 meters). The passengers who were poking their heads out of the windows all thought that there would be an accident this time, and everyone closed their eyes, unable to bear to see the imminent tragedy. Suddenly, the train body shook violently, and the train stopped abruptly. Looking at the cart in front, it was only two or three zhang (approximately 2-3 meters) away from the train head, and nothing was damaged. It was a relief. It turned out that what saved the cart was none other than the application of the air brake.</p>
<p>At this time, the technicians and experts sitting in the car couldn't help but admire Westinghouse from the bottom of their hearts and shook hands with him one after another. The next morning, the New York newspaper used the largest headline to introduce him and his invention, and Westinghouse's fame spread all over the world.</p>
<p>Since Westinghouse had won the trust of the general public, he immediately began to prepare for the establishment of the "Westinghouse Air Brake Company." When he was raising shares, funds flew in like raindrops, and a large company was quickly established. In 1871, the United States enacted a law requiring all trains in the United States to be equipped with air brakes. At this time, the arrogant president of the New York Central Railway Company had no choice but to calmly lower his head to the scientific and technological weapons.</p>

<h3>"The Far East Magazine"</h3>
<p>— Ze Xiang</p>
<p>—Volume 1, Issue 1</p>
<p>At the end of 1936, a strange force suddenly emerged in the magazine world of our country, that is, "The Far East Magazine," which appeared with a brand-new position and form. This magazine is published by the Da Dong Magazine Society, which is based in Japan. Before we examine its content, we can introduce its purpose.</p>
<p>In the prelude to the inaugural issue, their editors clearly announced their mission. They take the countries of the Far East as their targets, conduct objective research, and then issue opinions from the standpoint of peace and benefit of the Far East. They advocate that culture transcends national boundaries; therefore, they do not stand on the position of favoring a certain country, but conduct various business investigations on the countries of the Far East, and, more specifically, say the following:</p>
<p>"—Today, China demands internal unification and external independence, and maintains the beauty of its inherent culture, absorbs the advantages of modern Western European culture, and integrates and promotes it... This is the common demand and mission of the 450 million people of the Republic of China, and it is also what this magazine should awaken in its task."</p>
<p>We certainly have no objection to the task of magazines like "The Far East Magazine." Such a publication with the Far East as its position is of course also needed by our Far Eastern people.</p>
<p>However, after reading the inaugural issue of "The Far East Magazine," we felt a little emotional. Although the articles maintained an objective attitude and made honest investigations and criticisms of China, Japan, India, the Soviet Union, Siam, and other countries, their authors ultimately showed a subtle attitude, strongly implying a bias and sympathy for a certain major country. This is something that our Chinese readers, no matter what, cannot ignore and tacitly agree to.</p>
<p>Now, let's cite a few passages as evidence for our words. For example, the article "The Present Far East" by Yan Zhengdong has a slightly distorted problem in its conclusion. The conclusion is as follows:</p>
<p>"Looking at the above, it can be seen how turbulent the present Far East is! The historical culture of the Far East (Chinese culture and Indian culture) has been completely destroyed by the magic power of imperialism. India has only a corner of ruins left, and China has only managed to preserve its dying life. From the perspective of cultural relics and systems, it can no longer grasp the essence of the Far East. What is visible is only the struggle for power. In the future, how should we pursue the arrival of the new Far East? This is the only major mission of our Far Eastern people."</p>
<p>The circles next to the above-quoted words are what we have added; these places are what we cannot agree with, distorting reality and favoring the tone of a certain country. Furthermore, the author's observation of the "Japan-Germany Agreement" in this article is also exaggerated.</p>
<p>Next, let's take a look at Qiu Niqiu's article "Present-day Japan." After dissecting Japan's current political situation, military affairs, and diplomacy, the author came to the following conclusion:</p>
<p>"We shouldn't forget the history of the Anglo-Japanese alliance—Japan and Germany joined hands on the eve of World War II, and the entire world has been divided into two groups preparing for war. Modern Japan is not afraid of any war. Whether the continental policy will be realized under the Japan-Germany-Italy military alliance is not difficult to imagine."</p>
<p>Readers who understand the current international situation even slightly will object to such distorted, exaggerated, and out-of-date propaganda. The so-called Japan-Germany and Japan-Italy alliances are just a comical farce created by the fascist clowns of Western European politics and the declining, retired politicians of the Far East. In international politics, they will definitely not have the effect they themselves hope for! Therefore, we do not hesitate to protest against such poisonous words that insult China's independence!</p>
<p>In addition, the conclusions of "Present-day China" and "Present-day India" are also incorrect. Only "Present-day Soviet Union" and "Present-day Siam" are barely satisfactory and slightly suitable for an objective attitude.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is an article on invention, written by Bao Le. This can be said to be a relatively valuable article. The author explained the meaning, method, and steps of invention very clearly. In short, the inaugural issue of "The Far East Magazine" cannot satisfy our Chinese readers. This is because its articles are not entirely based on the so-called "objective attitude." However, the purpose of their founding is commendable. We hope that its content will be greatly improved in the future!</p>
<h3>"Cultural Construction," Volume 3, Issue 5: Special Issue on "The Problem of National Salvation Through Unification"</h3>
<p>— Liu Man</p>
<p>Volume 3, Issue 5 of "Cultural Construction" monthly magazine published a special issue on "National Salvation Through Unification" under the objective demand of national salvation through unification, which is unanimously supported throughout the country. Undoubtedly, its significance is of great importance and cannot be ignored by us. Because under the wave of national salvation through unification, on the one hand, we need to objectively practice it, and on the other hand, we also need to emphatically explain and review it theoretically.</p>
<p>Here, what deserves our attention most is Mr. Ye Qing's article "The Path to National Salvation Through Unification." In this article, Mr. Ye Qing regards the issue of China's unification as an inevitable historical trend. He also clarifies the reasons why China needs unification very clearly. He said, "If China wants to modernize, it must complete unification. Only with unification can there be peace, construction, and democracy. If China does not want to perish, it must also complete unification. Only with unification can it concentrate its forces, have no internal worries, and be able to resist foreign aggression to complete the national movement. If China wants to combine modernization and non-perish, or use modernization methods to save the country, it must especially complete unification..." In addition to explaining that China's unification is necessary, he also specifically put forward ways to achieve unification:</p>
<p>"㊀ Civil officials below the provincial government level must not concurrently hold military positions, and military officers must not concurrently hold civil positions, implementing civil-military separation.</p>
<p>㊁ The chairmen of the provincial governments in provinces and regions with possible separatist tendencies must be transferred to each other and cannot stay in their original positions for a long time.</p>
<p>㊂ The troops of all provinces must be reorganized into national troops, and their defense areas must be frequently transferred. The troops of provinces and regions with possible separatist tendencies must especially be divided and transferred to other provinces and regions.</p>
<p>㊃ Military officers at the level of army commander or higher, especially those with separatist ambitions, must be transferred from time to time and not remain in their original positions for a long time."</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Mr. Ye's opinions cannot be said to be absolutely perfect, but at least they can be used as a reference for the authorities.</p>
<p>The second is Mr. Ren Yili's "The Problem of China's Unification." In this article, Mr. Ren listed three types of people who undermine unification: ㊀ feudal remnant warlords: ㊁ blind movers who go against history: ㊂ frustrated bureaucratic politicians with political ambitions. According to Mr. Ren's opinion, China's disunity is all due to these three types of people interfering. If China wants to complete unification, it can only reduce these three evil forces.</p>
<p>Xue Jia's article "The Unification Movement and the Chinese Stalinist Party" is also worth our attention. In this article, Xue Jia thoroughly explained the absurdity of the peasant movement launched by the Chinese Stalinist Party in undermining China's unification. He said, "...The activities of the Stalinists at the current stage are an anti-historical action. At first, they obstructed the development of national capitalism for the sake of bankrupt peasants, and later they opposed unification for the sake of warlord separatism..." The historical errors of the Chinese Stalinist Party today are nakedly revealed in Xue Jia's writing.</p>
<p>The second is Mr. Zhang Fei's article "China's Unification and the Latinization of the Chinese Language." Mr. Zhang severely refuted the issue of Latinizing the Chinese language. At least it can correct the mistakes of those who currently advocate Latinization.</p>
<p>In addition, under the major title of "The Problem of National Salvation Through Unification," Wu Tiecheng, Huang Yanpei, Chen Gaoyong, Tao Xisheng, Tao Baichuan, Fang Zhi, etc., more than a dozen people expressed their opinions on national salvation through unification in great detail, among which Mr. Fang Zhi's article "(National Unification and National Consciousness" advocated that national unification must inspire national consciousness. He said, "...To complete the mission of unification requires the joint efforts of the people of the whole country. The so-called "everyone is responsible for the rise and fall of the world." This is exactly what it means. Because the formation of paper one is the manifestation of the people's centripetal force towards the country..." This is indeed a unique view.</p>
<p>Because of space constraints, I cannot say it in detail here. In short, under the unanimous demand of national salvation through unification throughout the country, this special issue of "Cultural Construction" on national salvation through unification is what we should need and should pay twelve points of attention to.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Armed Aggression and Economic Aggression</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>Around the time of the establishment of the Japanese Hayashi Cabinet, the friction between political parties and the military was unusually intense, with a great risk of collapse. However, in the end, the political parties, aware of the seriousness of the military's situation, showed some moderation. Therefore, the parliament was not dissolved. But I observe that in any country, in the struggle between the military faction and the civilian faction, the military faction will inevitably win. No matter how sufficient the reasons of the civilian faction are, it will inevitably suffer a crushing defeat. This is a natural law, from which there is no escape.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Hayashi Cabinet's administration, its policy towards China has superficially seemed more moderate. However, this is only a means. For North China, it still advocates military occupation. For other areas, it advocates economic cooperation. In its dealings with our country, it advocates abandoning the "overall solution" and instead using "batch-by-batch solutions", solving the small and easy problems first, and then the big and difficult ones. But its fundamental spirit still does not depart from Hirota's so-called "three principles." The only difference is the appearance and the tactics.</p>
<p>Generally, there are only two types of invasion policies: one is armed aggression, and the other is economic aggression. However, economic aggression must have military force as its backing, and military policy is often based on economic considerations. Therefore, any country in a position of being invaded must bravely resist to the end when invaded by military policy, and must also use all its energy to defend itself against economic policy. Therefore, the maliciousness of economic aggression is no less than the brutality of armed force.</p>
<p>Therefore, having observed the Hayashi Cabinet's policies towards China since its establishment, we can roughly see that on the Kwantung front, troops are desperately increasing. In the Peiping-Tientsin area, troops are constantly conducting large-scale exercises, and aerial reconnaissance runs rampant everywhere, without being restricted by international conventions. Towards other areas, it advocates economic cooperation, and so-called "economic investigation groups" come to China in batches to investigate. Under such circumstances, if we only focus on military aggression and neglect economic aggression, the harm of being exploited and bled will be no less than the devastation of airplanes and artillery.</p>
<p>So-called economic cooperation should be based on the principle of mutual benefit, not on the goal of exclusive benefit. However, what they now call economic cooperation is nothing more than means such as destroying the tariff system, freely buying, protecting smuggling, or forcibly exploiting minerals. No matter how cleverly these actions are named or how much they advocate friendship, the people of our country, even if foolish, will never be willing to be manipulated by them and drink poison to quench their thirst. This is something that requires no further consideration and from which there is no turning back.</p>
<p>Therefore, the other day, the chairman of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai and Yoshida Seiji, the manager of the Shanghai branch of the Mitsubishi Bank, expressed frank opinions on Sino-Japanese economic relations, saying, "Regarding the old topic of economic cooperation, such cooperation is only possible when China is still in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state, and when China is still a primitive agricultural country. However, China's politics and economy have recently made rapid progress, resulting in the Chinese people having a sincere feeling for their destiny, making Sino-Japanese relations worse than before." These are the words of leaders of the Japanese business community. Their deep understanding of China and the inappropriateness of Japan's China policy can be said to have fulfilled their duty of loyalty. Therefore, this kind of language should be a wake-up call for the Japanese, and even more so for the Chinese government and the public to be painfully aware of.</p>
<h3>From Jibe to Chibatong</h3>
<p>— Li Liwen</p>
<p>In the evening, I saw that village!</p>
<p>At that time, night clouds had begun to spread across the sky, the sun shone through the clouds on the western horizon, gently stroking the earth with yellow and soft light, flocks of birds returning to their nests noisily swept across the sky, flying towards the grove of trees shrouded in the distant evening mist... I, with tired steps, crossed a small hill and walked into the village along a narrow, winding path.</p>
<p>It was a village with few residents. Dozens of "Atap" (Note 1) houses were connected in a horseshoe shape: scattered coconut trees standing behind the village further increased its desolation... From behind and in front of the houses, the soft bleating of sheep could be heard intermittently.</p>
<p>I walked into the village through the horseshoe-shaped opening, and several Malay farmers who were cooling off at their doorsteps cast surprised glances at me... One family was setting up dinner at their doorstep, and I went straight to that family...</p>
<p>"Selamat (Note 2)!"</p>
<p>I greeted an old man at the door in fluent Sundanese, put down the half-old leather suitcase I was carrying, and gave a Muslim greeting.</p>
<p>The old man scrutinized me in detail without a word... Several curious children gathered around me... After a long, long time, the old man said softly and slowly:</p>
<p>"You probably want to spend the night here?"</p>
<p>"An old man's thoughts are always right (Malay proverb), old man, I've walked sixty miles from Jining to here," I said.</p>
<p>From the old man's eyes, there was a look of embarrassment.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't refuse a guest," the old man said, "I've been a guest myself, but... now, I'm very sorry, Uncle (Note 3), the Dutch have issued an order... Sije—" the old man shouted for someone, squatting down while biting on a grilled banana, "...now no one dares to let a guest stay overnight or eat a meal..."</p>
<p>"May I ask why this is?"</p>
<p>I squatted down, and the strong aroma of grilled bananas and hot coffee almost made my stomach churn. Saliva deliberately surged into my mouth as much as possible, and I felt as if two wet streaks were hanging from the corners of my mouth.</p>
<p>"This is..." A middle-aged woman came out from behind the house, squatting down silently and drinking hot coffee. The old man pondered for a while and continued, "Who knows, the Dutch issued this order a month ago, and no one dares to keep a guest anymore..."</p>
<p>"Then..."</p>
<p>I became confused... A scene of a dark and boundless wilderness suddenly appeared before my eyes: stars twinkled desolately above, crickets cried loudly all around, seemingly indignant at their insignificant existence... I vaguely felt the wings of desolation truly touching the tip of my heart...</p>
<p>"I will spend the night in the wilderness," I said softly to myself—suddenly, the last ray of hope shone before my eyes again, "Can't you just help me out for one night? Old man, the Dutch will definitely not know," I said.</p>
<p>The old man put down the chewed grilled banana, took a sip of hot coffee, looked at me gently with his eyes covered by heavy eyelids, and said slowly:</p>
<p>"For us, Uncle, that would be great no matter what. Muhammad said: Love and respect your guest like your brother, that is very true... It's just that the Dutch suddenly issued an order, how can we not obey it?... This is really something we can't do..." I almost didn't hear the old man's words. The question of finding a place to stay was so entangled in my mind that I murmured almost pleadingly. People are so thirsty for "security."</p>
<p>"Just let me spend the night in some corner, old man, the Dutch will definitely not know."</p>
<p>"Although the Dutch don't know, people will know," Sije, the very thin and dark middle-aged woman who had been worn out by work, said gently, "The Dutch have a reward!"...</p>
<p>...The old man interrupted Sije's words, rebuking his gently smiling wife as if admonishing her: "Talk too much! God will punish you!—What does a woman know?" The old man looked around and turned to ask me: "Uncle, we can do anything... Now the Dutch are under martial law! Every village is catching revolutionaries, and they are catching them very tightly." The old man sighed softly and expressionlessly, pouring a full cup of coffee into the cup: "...It's also very troublesome to harbor guests. I heard some people say that a family in Anggilie Village in front harbored a guest, and they were all locked up in prison together!..."</p>
<p>The old man loudly drank a mouthful of coffee, savoring it for a long time.</p>
<p>I knew I was hopeless, and stood up wearily...</p>
<p>"Goodbye, old man!" I said softly.</p>
<p>The evening sunlight became even paler. In the distant wilderness, on the small mounds, a layer of light mist had already covered the land. An unknown night bird occasionally cried out in the sky with a sense of terror, declaring to people: the approach of the night.</p>
<p>People are originally thirsty for security, but in order to not obtain security, people have to take risks?... Calm myself as much as possible with a helpless mood, I picked up my pace and walked into the wilderness that was gradually being swallowed by the hazy night mist...</p>
<p>Note 1: Atap is a kind of thatch. Atap houses are made of Atap thatch.</p>
<p>Note 2: Selamat, Malay, a greeting.</p>
<p>Note 3: Uncle, Malays call Chinese people "Uncle".</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The sky was not fully light yet, and Fang Jie'er got up. She opened the greasy dressing table by the dim light of dawn. She gently picked the hairpin from the top of her head and moved it to the middle, dividing her hair into two sides, and then combed it through with a fine comb. The paper window was still a grayish-white. She thought she would have to wait two or three more hours, so she propped her cheeks with her hands and stirred up the things she had repeatedly thought about last night.</p>
<p>Her heart was pounding as if countless small deer were running inside. This was really a shameful thing, especially since she was a maiden herself. In front of her, a vision of herself undressed suddenly appeared, standing in front of everyone, bending her waist and posing in various ways, either sitting or lying down. She felt a fire-like heat in both temples, and her chest heaved so much she could hardly breathe. This image embarrassed her, and she suddenly held her head tightly with both hands, shaking it constantly.</p>
<p>She vaguely saw countless pairs of strange eyes, like many sharp arrows, shooting at various parts of her body. From the time her mother raised her until now, she had never been so ashamed. Even on rainy days, when the courtyard of the large tenement was full of water, she did not dare to take off her shoes and socks, for fear of being laughed at for being barefoot. Now, she had to strip off all her clothes and stand for others to see. Not only to see, but also to be taken down by others. How could this not be shameful? She remembered when she went to the school with Mother Wang that day, the principal asked her:</p>
<p>"How old are you this year?" He took a step forward.</p>
<p>"Twenty years old," she replied, taking a step back, as if she had encountered a robber.</p>
<p>"Take a look!" She would never forget these words. She remembered what others had said: "When taking a bath, you must not see the sky, you must not see people. If a young woman is naked in front of others, she is unchaste, and no one will want her." A feeling of sadness and an unpredictable fate attacked her, and she couldn't help but tremble all over, and her eyes became blurred.</p>
<p>She thought of suicide. "Isn't this almost the same as the prostitutes in the brothels outside Qianmen?" Her proud heart was completely destroyed. She wanted to cry, but she couldn't make a sound. Her parents were still asleep and hadn't woken up yet. Suddenly, she seemed to see her mother's face again, how sallow, how haggard!</p>
<p>"Money! Money! Money!" This idea increasingly dominated her. She took a breath and murmured, "Money! All for money... money!"</p>
<p>Her father coughed in the back room. It was much brighter outside the window. Sunlight trembled on the trees. She immediately subconsciously picked up the comb and combed her tangled hair again, and then applied some white powder.</p>
<p>When she was about to go out, she shyly said to her parents:</p>
<p>"Mother, Father, I'm leaving!"</p>
<p>"What? You still want to go? Everyone has a face, every tree has bark. You want to do this dirty thing, aren't you afraid that your father will have his face torn off?"</p>
<p>She choked, unable to say a word. Her father was furious, propped himself up, and scolded her:</p>
<p>"You think I'm old and can't work, so you have to rely on you, don't you? I'd rather sell my old life than eat this bowl of dirty rice from you. A twenty-year-old woman, naked in front of others, what's the difference between this and the prostitutes in the brothel? I'd rather starve to death than watch you, this shameless thing, in front of others... hey," he paused, taking a breath. "How old are you this year, how old are you? You tell me, you tell me!"</p>
<p>She threw herself into her mother's arms and began to cry. Big strings of tears fell down.</p>
<p>"I get scolded by you,... get laughed at... for what? What for? You are old and can't work,... where's the money, where's the food? You're still forcing me... I'd better die..."</p>
<p>The whole room immediately fell silent. A helpless woman, suffering from oppression from all sides, was sobbing sadly.</p>
<h3>Mice Eating Cats</h3>
<p>— Luo Caiqing</p>
<p>Elementary school textbooks tell us that "cats can catch mice." There is also a joke in Shanghai: the warehouses of a certain foreign company were severely infested with mice, and the goods piled there were often gnawed and destroyed by mice. The foreign manager therefore ordered the doorman who guarded the warehouse to be questioned. That lower-class Chinese, "upon seeing a white man asking questions, was so frightened that he uttered two sentences of Chinglish: 'Zhi zhi zhi To much, miao hu miao hu No got.'" This proves that to catch mice, you need to raise cats.</p>
<p>The so-called "cats eating mice is not surprising." But mice in Lin'an, Zhejiang eating cats, isn't that a strange thing indeed—! That was a frivolous news item in a Japanese newspaper. There are many mice in the local area (Lin'an), and they are unusually large, not afraid of cats. According to eyewitnesses, several cats were actually killed by them: the process was quite astonishing. It is said that after a group of mice encounter a cat, one mouse, much like the daredevil team in the army, stands up and charges forward; it provokes the cat, immediately attracting the attention of the group of mice, who immediately surround the cat and brutally kill it. Therefore, the number of cats in that area is particularly small, it is said.</p>
<p>Because "mice eat cats," after being published in mainland newspapers, it was translated into Chinese newspapers by the Foreign Affairs Press, and with frivolous additions, it is even more noteworthy. Now we abandon the "Arabian Nights" style fables, saying that cats and mice are something from God's side, who descended to earth for some reason and became mortal enemies, etc. Legends: that is, a few years ago, the pictorial of this newspaper had a photo of cats and mice, which a curious white man spent more than three years, searching for the boldest mouse and the most docile cat in the world, to take such a precious masterpiece. It is a pity that I do not have that pictorial on hand, and I cannot remember the name of that foreigner. However, this can prove that it is not necessarily a "strange thing" that the mice in Lin'an, who are "unusually large," are able to surround cats and "brutally kill them."</p>
<p>Furthermore, cats seem to be able to not only catch mice, but we can often see them catching sparrows, butterflies, and other small animals in the yard. This is the same as humans: when the "empty city plan" sounds in their stomach, they will grab anything to eat, as long as it is edible. Cats catching mice and catching sparrows and butterflies only further prove Darwin's "survival of the fittest."</p>
<p>Since it is "survival of the fittest," then: "A mouse steps forward and charges forward, and the group of mice immediately surrounds the cat and kills it." Therefore, in the world of mice in Lin'an, "cats are particularly few in that area" is a matter of course.</p>
<p>There are many other examples that can be cited, such as mantises being captured, ...etc., and to speak more personally, even a lion, as majestic as the "king of beasts," will be peeled piece by piece after falling asleep. Is this also to be regarded as a "strange thing?"</p>
<p>"Mice can eat cats," the sleeping lion should also be awake!</p>

<p>Movies</p>
<h3>The Grand Light Screens "One in a Million"</h3>
<p>A Miracle of the 1937 Film World</p>
<p>Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, at great sacrifice, specially spent 150,000 gold yuan to invite the world-renowned ice-skating queen Sonja Henie to produce the film "One in a Million." Sonja Henie has won the world ice-skating championship for three consecutive years. Her ice-skating skills are unmatched in the world. When the company was filming this film, in addition to selecting a large number of super-class stars such as Adolphe Menjou, Keene Hirsch, and Don Ameche (male lead of the famous film "Ramona"), it also invited 100 ice-skating beauties and famous vaudeville performers to cooperate in the performance. The novelty and beauty are unprecedented. When the film was publicly screened at the largest movie theater in New York, the Roxy Theater, the crowds broke the highest record in five years, which proves the popularity of this film. The film is scheduled to be publicly screened at the Grand Light Theater from today onwards, and it is expected to cause a sensation again.</p>
<h3>"Dragon and Tiger" in Hengshan</h3>
<p>Work Stalled Due to Rain</p>
<p>"Dragon and Tiger" went to Suzhou to shoot the final scene of a fierce battle between the army and bandits. The work has been going on for almost a month, and it could have been completed earlier, but the work has been extremely difficult due to the weather, which is sunny and rainy. Recently, it has been raining continuously, and work has completely stopped. The Shanghai factory "Dream in the Universe" urgently needs to start filming, and the photography and sound recording were also assigned to Dong Keyi and He Maogang, who are in charge of photography and sound recording for "Dragon and Tiger." Therefore, director Xu Xinfu has been telegraphed to transfer Dong and He back. If necessary, Zhou Shimu or Wang Shizhen will go to Suzhou to assist.</p>
<h3>"Pig" and "She-Tiger"</h3>
<p>A Gag in "Crossroads"</p>
<p>In "Crossroads," Zhao Dan and Bai Yang live in adjacent apartments in the same building, separated only by a thin partition. Zhao Dan mistakenly believes that the apartment behind the partition belongs to the odious landlady, and to retaliate against her unpleasant demeanor when she often comes to collect rent, he throws banana peels, peanut shells, etc., to the back apartment every day. Bai Yang, unwilling to endure such mistreatment, returns the favor "as is."</p>
<p>Because Zhao Dan works at a newspaper, he leaves every night and only returns home at dawn the next day. Bai Yang, on the other hand, works in a factory, leaving at sunrise and returning late at night. As a result, the two never run into each other. Bai Yang does not know who lives in the apartment in front.</p>
<p>Once, because the apartment in front constantly threw dirty things over, Bai Yang angrily wrote a note: "You are too unreasonable and make trouble, you pig!" She also drew a pig and slipped it into the apartment in front through the crack in the partition. Zhao Dan saw it when he got back and was not to be outdone. He drew a tiger on paper and wrote: "You are a she-tiger!"</p>
<h3>Lu Ming in "Elastic Daughter"</h3>
<p>Time flies by like an arrow, and the season has changed from late autumn to early winter. Snowflakes, floating like willow catkins, cover a New Metropolitan Ballroom, shimmering like jade and silver. The music of "Elastic Daughter" blares frantically, resonating with the snowflakes dancing on the ground. At this moment, Lu Ming, a dancer standing by the microphone, singing the song "Elastic Daughter," suddenly thinks of her own entrapment in a sea of suffering from which she cannot extricate herself. She sees Yan Yuexian, willingly abandoning herself to a life of recklessness, and Zhu Qiuhen, tormented by fate and illness. She also remembers the runaway Shi Fu and Yu Guang, locked in prison, and wonders why they all met such fates. A flood of sorrow instantly wells up within her like morning dew. Moreover, she is pressured by her creditor, Qin, and ridiculed by the frivolous playboy Ma Loufen. She recalls how she first met the musician Xu Suling and how they later separated. Everything overwhelms her, making her extremely sad. She sheds tears and even sobs, but her sorrowful cries are ultimately drowned out by the music of "Elastic Daughter." The New Metropolitan Ballroom remains enveloped in an atmosphere of revelry.</p>
