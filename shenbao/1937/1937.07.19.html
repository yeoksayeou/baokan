<h3>國防綫上（十六）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派員叔棣</p>
<p>㊇“主張公道團”</p>
<p>這個帶有濃厚政治性的民衆組織的起來，是有着牠特殊環境背景的。</p>
<p>當時，（二十四年夏天）。山西當局們費盡心思，定出的“省政十年建設計劃”，剛剛是正待實行的時候。這時，共產黨的武力，忽然一下子達到陝北，而打算侵入山西。這樣的局勢，在一個短期間內，實在令山西方面，陷入了手足無所措的境地。</p>
<p>當時山西的情形怎樣呢？一方面，牠有四百萬農戶，其中有一百二十萬戶，可以做赤化的對象。共產黨的號召是利用山西可能供給的三十萬萬元財產，和一百二十萬武裝農民，作為新的赤化根據地。另一方面，山西的兵力，當時祇有十萬，而這樣數目的兵力，在與紅軍武裝鬥爭起來，能收多大效騐，却是一個非常可盧的問題。</p>
<p>“心腹之患！心腹之患”！山西當局們，這裏那裏地表示着訴苦的意思了。他們曾向人民呼籲過這樣的話：“共匪使我們弱上加弱，窮上加窮，我們和外國鬥爭，他們拉住了我們後腿。這就是帮助外國消滅中國！要想救國，必先防洪”！</p>
<p>然而頑强的共產黨勢力呢，在軍事上，以一種“勢如破竹”的情勢，在赤化工作上，以一種“無孔不入”的姿態，雙管齊下，同時併進地，向山西方面衝進了。！最後，連太原也宣佈了戒嚴。</p>
<p>山西的局面，二十多年來，比較是在瑰止狀態下的，這時，就起了空前的波動。這波動，使山西當局們不得不喊出了“防共須全體動員”的口號。那口號的內容是：“思想防共，民衆防共，政治防共，武力防共”，</p>
<p>據山西當局研究的結果，以為：山西招致共產黨勢力最易侵入的最大原因，共有兩個：一個是“土地私有的大空隙”，另一個，是“社會不平的小空隙”。為了彌補第一個所謂“大空隙”，他們籌劃了“土地村公有”的辦法，呈請中央决定：為了彌補籐二個所謂“小空隙”，他們又想出了兩個應急的辦法：㊀“施行合理的負擔”，㊁“組織人民，訓練人民”。</p>
<p>所謂“總動員防共”的四個方面裏，在思想方面，他們竭力批駁共產主義的錯誤：在武力方面，他們請求中央大軍的開入山西。據當時估計，陝北的共黨實力，也不過祇有“赤軍”二萬人，“赤衛軍”二十餘萬人，有槍械一萬多枝。在這兩方面，他們足可以抵制共黨的武裝破壞而有餘。那最成為問題，不得不加緊進行的，還是“政治防共和民衆防共”兩方面。</p>
<p>當時山西社會上政治上的不平情形，讓我們引用山西當局們自己的話：“現在各地方上的文武官吏，及紳士之家族親友，仗勢欺人，橫行鄉里者不少。而地方長官，瞻徇情面，對官紳的家族親友，不但不壓制，而且䐔袒。於是，小官小紳之家族親友，小不說理，大官大紳的家族親友，大不說理，這是現在社會不平的普遍現象。其次，貪官污吏，欺詐人民，軍隊擾亂人民等等。這更是給共宣傳政府不好的材料，使現政府失了民衆和信仰，而成為無民衆的政府”，在另一方面，共產黨抓住了山西這些弱點，以一種非常的速度，進行他們的赤化工作。那情形的令山西感到莫大恐慌，我們也可以引用山西當局們自己的話：“以武力來赤化我們的共產黨，我們可以剿滅他。以民衆來赤化我們的共產黨，我們是無法防禦的。你明知道某村已赤靑化了，但是問村長，村長說沒有赤化。因為村長如果說有，他的全家就要被共黨抄了。若派兵去村中鎮壓，村中人必說共產黨已經跑了，兵來甚好，可以駐下。兵雖駐在他的村裏，也擋不住他的親戚朋友與他往來，這往來的人，就是共產黨赤化他這個村子的開闢隊。可見駐上兵，也堵不住赤化的發展：甚而至於他還要赤化我們的軍隊。這實在是不知道他赤化，是無辦法；知道他亦化，也無辦法。</p>
<p>為了補救“社會上的不平”，山西的當局們不得不决必整飭吏治；為了抵制共產黨的赤化，他們不待不“組織民衆，訓練民衆”這本是兩種性質不同的工作，然而，他們却組織了一個團體，便牠一併去負担，這就是當時組織的所謂主張公道團”。這個組織，一起始時，就負着“政治防共，民衆防共”兩方面的使命：在政治上，牠負有監督政治，整飭官箴的責住；在另一方面，牠負有“組織好人，主張公道”的責任；企圖以這立足在好人壞人分別上的組織，去對批共產黨的立足在階級分化上的組織。所以，“主張公道團”一起始時的兩個口號，就是：“挾助好官好紳好人”，“制裁下官壞紳壞人”。</p>
<p>“生張公道團”的產生和性質，一開頭時，就是這種特別的情形。不過，自從共產黨改變策略，尤其綏戰烘發，以及最近的“和平統一”工作完成以後，山西環境上，本來已經有了多少的改變，似乎沒有再緊記牠開始時使命的必要了。然而，外面的人，一提起“主張公道團”，就會聯想到牠起始是抵制共產黨這樣的念頭。那末，到底怎樣是為了抵制共產黨而產生出來的呢！為了便亽讀者們了解這個組織產生的經統計，記者不惜把採訪所得，瑣瑣地披露一點在上邊。</p>
<p>自從二十四年下半年，“主張公道團”成立以來，到現在，算年頭已經有了三個，算實際時日，也差不多有了將近兩年的樣子了。這些時候裏，牠是山西最有力量的，最龐大的組織，曾經做過許多工作。自從戰爆發以來，今而後，牠在山西的局面裏，一定演着重要的角色，那也是可以斷言的。我們要了解山西，我們不得不說，這也是我們首應了解的對象之一。記者在山西的時候，曾經多方設法採訪，所得的，雖不能算是全的；然而，我在這裏，把牠分幾方面披露出來，想讀者捫也可以見到一斑了。</p>
<p>第一，“主張公道團”的組織現狀——這完全是由上而下的一種組織：除去“小組組長”是由“組員”推選，再經“村團長”核定外；其餘各層組織的負責人，一律由上級任命。㊀牠的最高級，為“總團長”與“副團長”。前者是閣百川氏；後者為趙次隴氏。次為六個“高級委員”。現任人員是：A邱仰濬氏，（民政廳長）。B王平氏，（財政廳長）。C樊象離氏，（建設廳長）D馮司直氏（前任敎育廳長）。E王懷明氏（綏署軍法處長）。F李江氏綏署參事㊂再次，為“秘書主任”一人，及“副秘書主任”二人。㊃又次為“秘書”多人，（現有三人）及六“枓”這六科的職務是；第一科事務，第二科組織，第三科考核，第四科檢舉，第五科宣傳，第六科訓練㊄幹部組織方面，“總團歸”以下，就是“縣團部”：“縣團部”設“縣團長”一人“副團長”二人，“文書”一人，“區團長”若干人。（這種“區團長”，上按照（各種行政區數目而設的，祇負指導聯絡的責任，並無實權，也沒有區團部的名目。）“㊅“縣團部”下面，是“村團部”，其中設“村團長”，“副團長”，“文書”，等各一人，“幹事”三人。（但“附村”之有團員五組以上者，得增設“副團長”一人；有“團員”二組以上，而不足五組者、得增設“幹事”一人。）㊆村團部以下，就是小組，設“組長”一人，“組員”四人，共五人。“組長”由“組員”推選出“村團長”核定。㊇每“村團”，設“文書”一人。（由小學敎員兼任；如有小學敎員二人以上時，則指定其中一人担任（文書”，其餘均兼任“副文書”）㊈每“村團”，設“指導員”一人至三人。（村長為“當然指導員”）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>對于危局之瞻望</h3>
<p>— 祺</p>
<p>十六日報載截至十六日上午一時止。和平局勢已定。前日忽傳“日政府派遣第五•第六•第十•第十二•第十六•五個師團來華。”昨且盛傳“日本動員四十萬人。預定戰費一千萬元。為大規模之侵略。”吾人就前後消息驟觀之。似若矛盾實則日方此種閃爍態度之下。固隱藏有陰險之作用也。蓋日方欲以和平空氣。懈我當地士氣。且分化地方與中央間之團結。離間民衆對二十九軍之愛護。日前和知等與地方當局接洽時。京滬兩地曾一度謠諑蠭起。及秦德純等闢謠三電發表。一般民衆之擬盧卽已渙然冰釋。二十九軍駐滬代表昨日招待記者。報告平津現况。益足證明二十九軍全體將士之忠勇衛國。日方亦知我方上下精誠國結。已非九一入前後可比。乃仍妄冀利誘平津當局。認為地方事件。逕與交涉。倘北方將領誤入骰中。彼可不費一彈不折一兵。浩浩蕩蕩開入平津。使華北山河歸彼掌握此策如果失敗則取高壓方策。調遣大軍入關。採用松室孝良所謂“恐日病”建議。企圖威嚇二十九軍迫成城下之盟。果爾則所謂“華北明朗化”卽可成事實矣。但自蘆構橋事起。日方所惴惴不安者。內懼國內經濟捉襟見時。外懼歐美列強密切注視。且與蘇俄為爭黑龍江二小島。正在齟齬。如果中日促成大戰華方固損失不資。日方亦必受相當損失。曠日持久。或有引起意外事變之可能。故日方思有以從速了之速了最巧方法。莫如威脅利誘。不戰屈人故凡所謂接洽和平也調遺大軍也日僑歸國也不願第三國調停也。皆其顯著之作用。若謂和平為緩兵之計。猶為皮相之談也。</p>
<p>吾人收以中華國民。名義。明告日方當局曰。和平固所願望。但以我方不喪權不辱國。日方無條件撤兵。保證以後不再無端挑釁。方有和平可言。</p>
<p>吾人又站在國民地位。敬告平津當局曰。蘆溝橋通譯效一帶。諸公武裝保衛國土。民衆極端欽敬。雖日來天津方面中日當局不斷拉洽。而宋哲元昨且與香月有所洽商。祇要本保全主權不失寸士誓言。結束危局吾人亦不反對。如果日方無理要挾。决意開釁。甚望本喜峯口抗敵精神。再為民族爭光。繼續不斷抗戰。吾全國民衆。必將傾全力為吾敬愛之二十九軍作有力之後援也。</p>
<p>最後吾人又希望政府除命駐外使節。致牒九國公約簽字國促其注意。並以國際公法與條約所含有之和平方法。與日方解决爭端。在另一方面。亦須為萬一之準備。弗令忠勇之二十九軍獨當兇燄之衝。吾人愛好和平。而尤賓貴主機。屈辱求和。喪失寸土。吾知我政府必與人民同起誓死抗爭也。</p>

<h3>防空與防毒（續）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>於是那話片便把在瓦斯室中試騐防毒面具當兒所紀的情形，說了一遍。（大意是警察稽查摩塞把一個盛滿瓦斯的膠質囊在火酒墟上燃着，一會兒，那囊便鎔化了，囊裏的毒气播滿了全室•但在燃著以前，曾用別針把囊刺穿，以免瓦斯見火爆炸，濺在皮膚上，會起水泡。那戴着防毒面具的幾個警察，從面具中報告他們所受的感覺。他們都說：不過覺得呼吸吃力些，說話費勁些，頸下的四周，因為皮膚柔嫩，覺得有些兒刺惱，其他却不覺得有什麼不舒服。）</p>
<p>那代表又說道：我們今天是在諾汀罕警察署瓦斯室中參觀警務稽查摩塞跟幾個警察學生實行正式訓練，曾將他的訓話，跟學生問答的話，紀録片段如下：</p>
<p>摩塞說：你們看已鎔化了，室中現在已傳播着催淚的瓦斯。你們看見這室的四壁跟頂上，都漆得很白，假使瓦斯能看見的話，你們可以看得明明白白。可是你們現在却沒看見什麼，你們不要以為這兒已沒有瓦斯了，實在是有的，倘若你們不戴上呼吸器，你們現在會覺得很難受。讓我來試騐試騐你們，大家可搖搖頭，看看呼吸器戴得對不對，你們的眼睛都清楚麼？</p>
<p>學生却答道：很清楚。</p>
<p>摩塞說道：這就表示你們的呼吸器戴得都對，倘若這時不對的話，眼睛會看不見，臉上會悄滿了眼淚，你們便想奔到外面去了。</p>
<p>我們試騐完畢，便走上警察署的頂層，看見一羣靑年警察，淌着眼淚，在那裏嗅盛着毒瓦斯原素的瓶，那氣味像乾草蒜頭等一類簡單東西發出的，但那便是芥予瓦斯綠化炭養備涙瓦斯等毒氣的氣味。（廣播演說詞完）</p>
<p>從上面的演說詞看來，英國在最近的將來，人人都可以得到一個防毒面具，現在由政府存儲着，等到戰事發作的時候，便免費發給他們。並且還在各處設立瓦斯室，試騐防毒面具是否有效，以免臨時失愼•不但英國如此，最近據德國航空部長戈林將軍宣佈，德政府已在柏林漢堡等處把防毒面具發給人民，不旦卽將推行於全國，其中並分男子戴的，女子戴的，孩童戴的數種。戈林將軍上月五日在柏林奧林匹克體育塲演說德國航空設備時，曾說首：“一旦戰事發生，男子效命疆塲，女子應在後方擔任防空的職務”。</p>
<p>空襲中最可怕的東西，除了毒瓦斯外，還有燃燒炸彈，也是空防上最要緊的一件事。最近上海泰晤士報載有英國防禦燃燒炸彈計畫的一段新聞如下：</p>
<p>一戰爭中防空救急隊的職務，現在已由英政府發表詳細的建議。軍事當局相信燃燒炸彈是空襲中最厲害的武器之一，所以現在怖置有實數的防禦計書，至為急要，政府的建議，是根據這種信念擬成的。可是要使防禦燃燒炸彈發生實在的效果，須得由民眾熱必合作，才能達到目的。因此現在急應招募志願服務者，把他們練成消防輔助隊，跟消防處的糾察隊。這些隊伍，可算得承平時的後備軍，招募跟訓練，須分為四大類，㊀在緊急時全日服務的消防隊，㊁每天抽出時間服務的消防隊，㊂管理消防處的男女，㊃擔任其他雜務的男女。這些隊伍應需的人數，共約二十萬人。消防輔助隊須經過六十小進的訓練，才能適用，但是消防糾察隊跟巡邏隊，只須受過基本的訓練，便能服務。每區應在適宜地點置備高力的消防器械。那流動巡邏隊，是預備在敵機乘襲的當兒，分巡各街道，以便一有火警，在初起時便把它救熄。現在新式大飛機，每架能載燃燒小炸彈一千枚，每個炸彈擲落時，茍不立即對付，很容易釀成大火災。政府並已命各處地方官草擬防禦燃燒彈的周密計畫，現在民眾都已知道有實效的國防，是急不容緩的，所以適用的防空輔助隊的組織，定能在短時期內完成。”我們從這一段新開，可以知道國民對於防空，不論男女老少，都有應盡的責任。據最近消息，英國各大城的婦女，現在已開始受防空訓練。自然啦，男子更不必說了。</p>
<p>再者，英國的陸軍部還巴遵行政府宣怖的政策，預備將內防軍改為防空軍，許多處的內防軍已聲明願受改編。因此陸軍部曾發表一文如下：“陸軍委員會參於內防軍所表示的公共精神，跟他們情願擔任國防上至為重要的新責任，很為感慰。現在的空軍新戰區，須得有這種隊伍在開戰之初，甚至在開戰之前，立即準備應戰，．這是使保衛國家的防空設備達於非常有效程度所必要的一件事。倘若等動員以後，再行訓練，那是沒有機會了。因此本委員會在這種情勢中願意聲明防空軍的軍官跟兵士，念宜在承平時佈置完備。本委員會對於內防軍跟有關係的內防軍協會覺悟他們新任務的重要，跟努力招募人員，使實力鞏固，是沒有疑慮的。可是茍非全國整個起來贊助，他們的努力，是難以成功的。本委員會願請公共團體跟勞工的僱主，凡有防空隊駐在他們附近的，都得提供種種可能的便利，跟鼓勵僱員加入這種隊伍，每年除駐營的兩星期以外，還得給他們一兩星期的假期，薪水却照常發給。如果照這樣辦理，那末，又是一次表示吾國人民的好意，跟愛國精神了。”</p>
<p>我們看了各國對於防空日夜準備的情形，怎麼可以無動於中，不急起直追呢？防空並不是一句空話，引起人民注意的防空展覽會，雖然重要，但是全國人民還得整個起來贊助政府的凡應做的事，都應該趕緊實行那才可以在戰爭時收實效哩。倘若等到敵機來襲時，再着急佈置，那便算不得防空，簡直是白白空防啦。</p>

<h3>西班牙內戰的透視（下）</h3>
<p>— （法國通信）</p>
<p>㊂西班牙變咸國際戰爭的雛型戰場</p>
<p>說起此次西班牙內戰，算扡是國際小規模戰爭的一個，也不過分。因為我們知道叛軍的軍械，是山德意供給的。</p>
<p>政府軍的軍械，是山英法蘇俄各國購來的．叛軍的軍隊，除去一小部份的西班牙法西斯黨與保王黨員組成外，有的是摩洛哥土兵，大部份則為德意的正式軍隊。（據各方的推測，最低限度意軍有十五萬人，德軍約為六萬人，現弗朗哥已無實權，軍事方面，全由德軍官及駐薩拉蒙加德大使Faupel將軍，主神一切）。政府軍方面，則為參加人民陣線政府各政黨黨員與勞働階級以及從全世界各國為保護自由公理，民主制度而來參戰的國際自願軍．在這種狀態之下的西班牙內跋，豈不是國際戰爭的雛型戰塲。各列强的參謀本部，正藉此機會，得到實地試騐其最新式的坦克飛機，槍械的效能。從這十個月作戰的結果，事實證明一九三七年軍事上的防禦力非常强大，進攻難於防守。從玛德里的爭奪戰，可以知道：雖西政府的守軍，組織並不究備，祇要存背城借一，死守的决心，則敵軍就無法前進．這種可慰的結論，是由德國的Gazette　de,FrancfortThe新近發表的．倫敦的Economist最近更將本題加以精密的研究云：德國參謀本部對西班牙作戰的計劃，一如一九一四年，以為祇要用機械化的軍隊，以及用以自炫的坦克車隊，竭全力的進攻，不難在迅速間取得最後的勝利。但是從西班牙內戰中、得到的結果，證明德國此種軍略並不正確。我們都知道：政府的防禦組織，是匆促開預備起來的、居然也能抵抗現代最新式的武器，這樣說來，也可以說道是馬齊諾戰綫政策的勝利！最近西政府軍，自軍隊改組，號令統一後，戰鬥力量大增，軍事經騐亦日益豐富，一切防禦工程，模仿馬齊諾戰綫均在地下，互通聲氣。自上月戰事勝利以來，所進佔各地，均依此辦法，進一步，即組織一步，不在乎神速，而在嚴密堅固。對於坦克車的毀減，並不如從前想像上的那麼困難在這次西戰中德軍於應用坦克車作戰，會受到極大的失望。飛機也証明其反攻勢力較之進攻為可怖。德軍的新式槍械，有時尚不及敵軍所用者的靈效．至於毒氣的運用則並未影響及於軍心。其中效用最顯著者，要算高射砲。故西戰十月來，事實上的教訓，使得德國當馬，受到兩重的失望，這就是：軍事戰略的與軍需技術的兩種失敗。因之，德國方面，近日對於不干涉政策輿維持歐洲和平，表面上似巳傾向於安協。</p>
<p>㊃西班牙戰爭中證明各國軍械的誰勝誰敗</p>
<p>講到這次列强在西班牙內戰中，所使用的各種新式武器，從技術方面來觀察其威績究竟如飼！則因各國嚴守秘密，外間極難探提詳情。不過在事實上的證明德國在運用其坦克車作戰的軍略，極不確，德軍方面所自誇的鐵甲車師，（坦克車隊二旅，共五百輛每輛有機關砲爾挺，全師的跑火密度當為千挺，移動速率，每小時五十公里，如此的破毀力，則難銅墻鐵壁，也難祇禦。預想敵軍的防禦陣綫，當此鐵軍，那有不被衝破的呢？不料事實上就是因了這速度太快，鐵甲保護，就薄弱了，更因移動太速，後面步軍，未能跟上，而敵軍則具備着抗坦克車砲，以及手提機關鎗，步鎗、使用得法，嚴陳靜待，則此種鐵甲軍，終受到毀減的命運。法國式的坦克，速率較慢，鐵甲保護力强，在現時似乎可以稱為戰塲可怕的戰具了。因此、證明德國的鐵甲量，在未正式全部開到戰塲上發揮威力之前，似已由在西戰中小規模的試騐而失敗了。德國的抗坦克砲（口徑三生丁五），以攻蘇俄的坦克車，也曾得到光榮的：頁，雖蘇俄的坦克車，鐵甲較重，尚不足以抗拒德國的抗坦克砲，實有着火的危險。德軍的新式高射砲卻為此次戰爭中最有效的武器，此種德國新式高射砲，由德軍使用，由德軍看守，即弗朗哥的軍官，亦不准近視，用過的跑殼點明數目，帶回德國，德國的防空軍（D.C.A）借此實地調總其人材，時更換新軍，以資練習。至於意大利的摩托化軍隊，在瓜逹拉迦拉一戰中，嚐了多少苦味，當意軍總攻瓜達拉迦拉政府軍時，曾派遺大隊摩托化的意軍（約一千二百輛），担任前綫的進攻，不料摩托化的意軍，前進迅速，興後隊相距五十公里時，司令部聯絲斷絕，尚未遭遇大部政府軍，當停車於火路上休息時，被政府航空軍隊二十架所轟炸，量像至為恐怖，所携带之高射砲，因車篷未落，一時不及應用，結巢汽車一千輛被毀，而政府軍亦趕到，俘擄一千五百人，此役意軍慘敗的結果，實際上則使各國參謀部，多一番經騐，多一番考慮。航空作戰方間，在一九一四年的歐戰時，高射砲與驅逐機所能擊下的飛機數，成績等於一與五比，可是目前在西戰中，所得的航空作戰的結果，則恰成相反比數，被高射砲擊下者為五架，驅逐機擊下者一架，證明高射砲比驅逐機的射擊飛機的效能為大了。英法德意蘇各國的航空材料，則未分顯著的優劣。至於世界上盛傳的最新科學戰所謂。劇毒氣，死光，病菌彈以及別種恐怖的破壞方法，尚不過是理想的軍事談話而已，也許有一天會出現的罷。</p>

<p>迎頭趕上</p>
<p>比賽之變化雖多、而精彩則甚少、合作工作、菲隊較爲平滑、人才亦較平均、雙方犯規纍纍、不可勝數、總計罰出四人之多、未免美中不足、中華隊中鋒人才之恐慌、尤爲致敗之原因、陳學崇巳非理想、孫惠培之入選、令人疑慮、因此陳一下塲、陣綫立見動搖、寫昨晚最顯見之事實、開賽後、雙方混戰甚久、陳學崇才先開紀錄、不料菲隊大得其手、－連反得八分、幸陳錢馮迎頭趕上、各中一球、第一節各八平手、</p>
<p>佔先一分</p>
<p>第二節開始、菲隊更換全班人馬、雙方雖各有投擲機會、甚見生疏、極少命中、陷籃圈不入者、數見不鮮、列安士．襲石格、接連罰中、菲隊以十二比十佔先、然馮念華王南珍之相繼建樹、上半詩完畢、中華仍以十三比十二、多一分、</p>
<p>菲隊超出</p>
<p>休息之後、中華頓見振作、會以十九比十四、二十比十六、二度估最佳之優勢、惜乎後勁稍差、第三節終於先盛後衰、成二十一比二十六、落後五分、第三節開始後•念華良雄各有妙中、其勢頓盛、然在此關頸、陳學祟四次犯規罰出、孫惠培替補、大貓表演難不能滿衆意、然中華隊仍繼續得分、直至二十比十六、菲隊乃從後趕上、巴萊克與華雷爾兩鋒、川流不息、破籃而入、第三節之結果、乃被其反多五分、二十六比二十一、</p>
<p>不分勝負</p>
<p>最後之十分鐘、又見花樣甚多、二十九比二十四時、顏連進四次犯規罰出、然一回頭、菲人蘇萊士亦同樣判刑、卡列洛勇猛無匹、中菲間之比數、乃相去愈遠、二十七比三十四、中華落後七分、念華敬鏞各加二分、形勢轉佳、毋奈列安士亦見中的、蔡文煥遠球妙射、空中穿入、追成三十三比三十五、相差祇二分、形勢隨之大爲緊張、豈知蔡文煥又被罰一分、在此最後之二分鐘中、張良雄居然一舉而中、從絕望中、尋出生路、正大爲歡躍、巴萊克又見中的、菲隊又多二分、幸馮念華之一撲、時間終了、成各三十七、</p>
<p>延長時間</p>
<p>延長五分鐘、中華隊之勝利、似已絕少把握、因體力之不如、得勝甚屬艱難、果然列安士與卡列洛一搭擋、連珠而中、强弩之末、形勢已定、王南珍馮念華排除萬難、搶得四分、無補實際、最後結果、為四十一比四十八、相差七分、</p>

<h3>一九三七年惠勃爾登網球大會（六）</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>第三日</p>
<p>惠勃爾登第三日、空氣的緊張、比前兩天更增加了許多、觀衆擁擠、已經成爲惠勃爾登的常態、今天男子單打一共比賽三十二塲、經過這次淘汰的結果、將剩下最後的三十二人、我國許承基今日遇到英國王爾德、王爾德在英國的地位是第三四名、他昨天苦戰五盤以後勝法國第二名手彼得拉、許多人都替許承基担心、恐怕他會失败、不過英國的體育記者却不肯先作預言、因爲他們知這許承基的實力、王爾德新近球藝的突進、這是一家事實、但要戰勝許承基、當時記者個人是不肯相信的、爾人劇戰結果並、不出吾人所料、許承基獲勝、起初以爲許將以四盤勝王爾德、五盤劇戰因爲體力關係、恐怕許有戰敗可能、歷來許承基劇戰五盤以後、總要倒霉、這是第一次、居然五盤尚能夠勝利、這是以證明許近來體力的進步、值得我們高興的、蔡的對手英國夏士、一個第二三流的選手、照道理蔡有戰勝的可能、不幸五盤以後、蔡終於失敗、於是乎最後三十二人中、我國只有許承基人而已、女子單打選手、經過昨天比賽以後、尚剩下五十五人、今天一共比賽二十四塲、淘汰的結果將剩下最後的三十一人、男子雙打今天也舉行補賽、此外混合雙打也有八塲比賽、我國參加此項比賽只有何仁軒－人、今天不幸也一出屬即受了淘汰、</p>
<p>▲克蘭姆的傑作</p>
<p>今天的男子單打、七位“主將”、並打敗了一位“主將”的克勞福特、都安全地渡過了這一關、勃奇的對手是英國名雙打之一休士、休士的單打本年度還有代表英國出席台杯的希望、然而照此次的成績看來、英國今年想保留台杯定凶多吉少、勃奇以直落三盤獲勝、比數爲六比二、六比二、六比二、同樣日、休士的雙打配搭脫蓋、（他也有代表英國出席台杯單打的希望）與克蘭姆之戰、也以直落三盤失敗、克蘭姆今天打得太妙了、他砲彈式的發球、並正反手抽球、以及上前攔網時地位的適當、幾乎使人無法、“吹毛求疵、”他的勝脫蓋、比數爲六比二、六比○、六比四、極見容易、今天比賽以後、鐵爾登曾表示、克蘭姆有戰勝勃奇得到本年度世界錦標的可能、就一般人也有這種感覺、克蘭姆今天的一戰、完全是世界名家的風度、球藝比去年時似乎還耍進步了許多、</p>
<p>其他“主將”奧斯丁以直落三盤勝薩平（美）比數爲六比二、六比三、六比○、派克也是三盤、比數爲六比○、六比三、六比一、格蘭脫四盤、比數爲六比二、三比六、六比三、六比○、麥格拉綏四盤、比數爲六比三、六比三、五比七、六比二、亨克耳最危險、五盤以後才獲勝、比數爲二比六、七比五、三比六、六比○、六比三、他的對手是一位英國不出名的網球家、此次幾乎出了一次“冷門”至於克勞福特也以直落三盤獲勝、</p>
<p>▲李沙納碰着釘子</p>
<p>女子单打今天應戰的六位、“主將”都平安渡過、除了李沙納女士以外、其餘五位都以直落兩盤獲勝、李沙納女士今天受了一塲虛驚、她的對手是英國林蒲女士、一位過去不大引起一般人注意、實際上却是第一流的女網球家、第一盤林蒲女士在十分鐘內即以六比一的比數獲勝、她的發球幾乎有馬蒲耳女士的分量、正反手抽球的準確並迅速、在都足以使李沙鈉小姐束手無䇿、球塲中的觀衆無不替李女士担心、以為今天又出了一個“冷門”但李女士究竟是“沙塲老將”絲毫沒有着急的態度、打球還是一樣的從容、林蒲女士到底是個缺乏經驗的選手、求勝之心過切、遇球即抽、時常作不可能的攔網、結果自殺的球一多、態度更不自然、於是乎連輸兩盤、比數為六比一、六比二、李沙納女士獲勝、其實以球藝來論、林蒲女士的實力、不但在李沙納小組之上甚、至於可以說、惠勃爾登的全部女將恐怕都不是她的敵手、她唯一的毛病、就是性急、道一天李沙納女士只取守勢、所以她得到最後的勝利、</p>
<p>▲許承基挫王爾德</p>
<p>今日許承基與王爾德之戰、替中國增光不少、兩人的發球都是砲彈式的、正反手抽球並上前攔網、大家都有相當的實力、許的獲勝、除球藝較王爾德稍佳以外、其次就是許有耐心應戰、態度一點不慌忙、再次、許懂得自己的幾點、不常去上前攔網、（雖然許的攔網技術是第一流的）因此保存了不少氣力、所以有苦戰五盤的可能、</p>
<p>第一盤開球後、王爾德先勝兩局、接着許也勝回兩局、比數爲二比二、到了三比三以後、許連勝兩局、王爾德雖再度得到了一局、但最後輪到許發球時、即以六比四的比數、勝了第一盤、</p>
<p>第二盤雙方的競爭更烈、幾乎是輪到誰發球、誰即勝利、直到四比四的比數後、許一不小心、連輸兩局、失了這一盤、比數爲四比六、王爾德勝、</p>
<p>第三盤是許的世界、王爾德屢次上前攔網、都爲許的高球所破、這一盤中、許表演得十分精彩、觀衆掌聲雷動、王爾德於一面倒的形勢下、只勝兩局、比數為六比二、許勝、</p>
<p>第四盤大家已露出倦容、情形恰同第二盤相反、就是輪到誰發球誰輸、難然、大家都出全力對付、所以戰情也極緊張、王爾德曾以四比二估先、接着許爭回－局、此數爲四比三、到十第八局時、王爾德抽了一個球、已經出了界綫、假如許得到這一點後、比數將成為四比四、不幸裁判員失察、反而把這一點算做王爾德的賬上、當時許似乎受了刺激、連打了兩個野球、結果遂成了五比三的局面、第九局時、許的心情好像還未恢復、終於以六比三的比數失敗、電一盤王爾德勝後、結果就各勝兩盤、</p>
<p>第五盤是最後的一盤、事前大家有點替許承基担心、因爲惠勃爾登同台杯比賽不同、比賽五盤中間並沒有休息的時間、而兩人此時巳苦戰兩小時、許的體力如何、自然是一個重要問題、這一盤開球後、許先勝一局、王爾德也同報一局、比數一比一、至此不但許的態度巳恢復原狀、相反的、王爾德被許幾個妙球所算以後、自已一時性急起來、他那種悻悻的態度、引起觀衆大笑、許乘機連下三局、比數爲四比一、王爾德再度作最後的掙扎、也連勝爾局、比數爲四比三、至此、許承基也打了一個出界綫的球、情形恰同第四盤時王爾德的球一樣、裁判員也沒有看到、王爾德再加上了這一氣、已成了“强弩之末”最後的兩局、許擊來更是得心應手、完全是世界名手的姿態、於全塲觀衆的掌聲中、得到了最後的勝利、</p>
<p>許承基今天的勝利、所以值得我們注意的、並不只因爲他達到了最後三十二人的階段、更重要的、這是第次、苦戰五盤以後、他還能夠擊敗實力雄厚的對方、他證明了“中國人的體力不如歐洲人、所以運動比賽要失敗”這種中國運動界中人的流行語、不龍作爲一種定義、只要不斷的努力、只要你有堅强的意志、歐洲人的身體也不是鐵做的、</p>
<p>▲雙打出了冷門</p>
<p>今天男子雙打中、也出了一個“冷門”、澳洲名雙打、本年度惠勃爾登“主將”之一的克勞福特與麥格拉綏、竟以直落三敗於捷克雙打孟瑟耳與黑區特手中、而且比數還是直落三盤、六比三、六比三、六比二、孟瑟耳左單打第一賽中曾受了克勞福特一股氣今天總算稍爲報復了一點、</p>

<h3>告全美民衆　董顯光咋播講最近中日問題</h3>
<p>美國人士、對於華北中日糾紛、異常關切美國哥倫比亞廣播組合、特約董顯光氏、於昨日（十八日）上午六時四十五分、在滬向全美民衆、播講最近中日問題、並由交通部廣播電台轉播國內各地、其演辭如左、</p>
<p>哥倫比亞廣播組合、能給我這個機會、來把威脅世界和平的中日危機講幾句話、我是十分感謝的、在未人主題以前、讓我先把一九一五年以來中日關係的歷史背景、扼要的說一說、</p>
<p>在一九一五年、日乘世界各國捲入大戰漩渦、無暇東顧的機會、突然向中國提出了二十一條要求、中國倘全部接受了這二十一條、簡直就變成了一個日本的附庸、到了一九一三年、大部份靠着美國的努力、完成了九國公約保證中闕領土的完整可是這公約到了一九三一年、就給日木破壞了、它估領我東北四省、並威脅我北平天津、中國當時、力不足以作有效抵抗、於是河北省接近長城的東部、就劃成了非戰區域、不久、日本又鼓動漢奸殷汝耕、宣佈非戰區域脫離河北省治、並警告南京、若以武力脅迫殷汝耕、日本不甘坐視、接着中國另一省份察哈爾的北部、也給日本估領去了、從一九三五年以來、日本政治家還口口聲聲要把華北五省、完全收歸日本的統治、說這是他們不能動搖的决意</p>
<p>這種特殊的中日關係、是絕端片面的、你們若想切實瞭解這局面、我可以給你們一個比仿、這好比你們美國突然來了一批外國軍隊、把你們的紐英倫州搶了去、事實上、我們的東北四省、比你們的紐美倫州還要大、總面積是五十萬方英里、或者你們的紐英倫州還得加上一個泰克薩斯州、你們的最大兩州、泰克薩斯州和利佛尼亞州、併起來、也許差不多、</p>
<p>現在講你們想、假使這外國軍隊、估領了你們的紐英倫、就把它做根據地進而征服美國的其他部份、特別注意在沿大西洋海岸的諸州、假定說、從佛琴尼亞而北、一直向西、由米契根、威斯康辛而迄西北、奄有大湖流域的土地你們應作怎樣的感想、十天前、日本所製造的新事件、其侵略的目標是北平、這是中國的舊都、正像華盛頓一樣離海岸約有八十英里、它的海口是天津、正像紐、或費拉台爾費亞、或巴底摩爾是華盛頓的海口一樣、在這新事件沒有發生以前、日本軍隊駐在天津的有七千人、駐在北平及其附近的有三千人、這已經超過辛丑絛約所規定的駐軍人數、很多很多了、</p>
<p>七月七日晚十點鐘、日軍一隊、在駐有中國軍隊的宛平城前演習實彈野戰、宛平城接近蘆溝橋、這又要請你們設身處地想一想、假使一隊駐在華盛頓的外國兵、就在你們京城附近十餘里間演習夜戰、我說其用意在製造事端你們一定會同意的、因為在這種情況之下、發生事變、是再容易也沒有了、果然、事變眞就發生了、</p>
<p>據日人說、他們不見了一個參加演習的兵、於是這一隊日兵、就在午夜十二時、要求開進宛平城去搜索這一個逃兵、這種要求、當然給中國軍隊拒絕了、於是日軍竟開砲轟城、同時就毀壞了我們的蘆溝橋、</p>
<p>不到兩小時、日本已開到援軍、參加進攻、中國軍隊經其一再挑釁之後、到這時方開始還聲、日軍爲什麼單挑宛平和蘆溝橋、做他們進攻的目標呢、因爲這兩地在形勢上實在太險要了、是中國國防綫上之重鎭、並且控制着由北平達漢口、直通申國中部的一條鐵路、日本早就想佔領這個要塞、以隔離北平的、一年以前、他們就用這一高壓的手段、佔領了北寗路上險要的豐台面見成功所以這次又來嘗試了、</p>
<p>七月七日和以後幾天、衛空的結果、日方野心益發擴大、竟聲言要佔領我北方更大的領土了、爲了要支持他們這種侵略計劃起見、在一個星期中問、平津一帶竟開到了日軍二萬五千多人、據日軍高級長官說、其目的是要“懲罰暴戾的中國人”、東京又聲稱、日本擬再遣五師團來華、換句話說、他們在華北的軍隊、不久就要有十萬人、日本業已控制中國北寗路、並佔領沿路各處的要塞、在中國境內、他們任意在各處挖掘戰壕、日本軍隊不獨阻碍中國人的安居樂業、並也阻碍其他非中國人的事業、美國海軍參贊的乘車、在中國公路上行駛、日軍竟要搜查乘車者拒絕、他們竟持槍刺威脅、幸經其軍官及時喝止、不然不知道要發生怎樣可怕的侮辱、日本領袖這種盛氣凌人的姿態、跟中國行政院長兼軍事領抽蔣介石先生、所取鎮靜而莊嚴的熊度兩兩對比、實在是值得注意的、自從事變發生以來、蔣先生和他政府中的同僚、始終沒有說過一句有挑撥性的話、他們决不像日本的政客軍人、那樣儘量挑撥人民戰爭的狂熖、</p>
<p>目前日本所取的政策、是跟一九三一年佔領滿洲時的政策、完全相同的、一切現象例如放言中國無誠意、製造事件、强辭威脅、舉行夜戰演習等、簡直一一重新搬演出來即利用人民的民族心理、桃撥起戰爭情緒的狂燄、其手腕也正與一九三一年相同、</p>
<p>日本一方面說在華北任意橫行、是條約和協定給他們的特權、然而他們因為要奪取瀋陽、佔領滿洲、又不惜同時破壞了九國公約、克洛格公約及國聯盟約、他們視條約協定本若糞土、可是現在他們卸責難中國破壞威脅下所訂定的協定了、</p>
<p>日本軍隊在中國境內、旣享受着這種獨往獨來絕對自由的權利、任意破壞中國國防的實力、而日木外交家却在南京警告中國政府說、他們不能容忍中國政府給予中國自衛軍以精神上或物質上的援助、他們不能容忍中國軍隊開入與事件有開的中國境內、他們也不能准許南京政府．參加解决這項糾紛、他們的警告、若不遵守、竟威脅聲言將有不利的後果、</p>
<p>時局結果如何、實不是我們所能預斷、我對你們美國聽衆、當在沒有法子來描爲我們國內各方面風發雲湧緊張和憤怒的情態、中國的和平政策、我知道不用說明、你們都已十分明瞭的了、中國希望跟一切鄰國親睦敦善、尤對日本爲緊切、然而容忍侵略、究竟有個限度、我們政府自一九三一年日本佔奪滿洲之後、一向抱着息事寗人的態度、可是眼看我們豐僥的國土、給强鄰一塊塊剝奪而去、我們再也不能無盡期的繼續這種政策了、</p>
<p>我們政府、現在已派軍隊到河北省的邊境、是否將令該項軍隊繼續推進、防衛平津、將看局勢推移再定的了、可是日本現在巳在這種區域裏積極增兵、顯見大規模軍事行動有不能避免之勢、俏這種局勢展現出來、我們的軍隊、自不得不向北移動、其結果必為戰爭、他日影響及世界的又該怎樣、衹有上大可以知道的了、</p>
<p>我們知道、大半美國人不願因我們這面的糾紛、而捲入漩渦、然而我要你們想一想、現在戰爭是不容易局部化的、戰爭彷佛是鄰家失火、我國中國人固然希望我們的火、不要延燒到你們財產的區域裏、可是你們得知道、火這東門、是沒法子呌它局部化的、更何況這種火是澆上了帝國主義和民族野心的油</p>
<p>我們希望誠意擁護太平洋和平、亦即世界和平的人們、別遺忘了我們現有着磋議與行動的機構、這就是九國公約、這公約十年以來、向爲和平的屏障、破壞它的實惟日本、這公約雖不能阻止日本的侵我國土、可不能就說它也失掉了束縛簽字各國的效力、簽字各國若不能起而調解、日軍人若不肯取比較協調的態度、戰爭决難避免、我們在蔣委員長領導之下、整個民族所追求的、是在榮譽中的和平、在和平中的榮譽、倘日本再要挑撥我們、那末、找們為了榮譽、挾着榮譽不惜跟他們周旋於戰塲、最後、我願說、深信他日戰雲爆發的時候、太平洋對岸現在聽我演講的這個偉大的國家、跟中國素敦友誼、一定會響應着我們、高呼“願上帝維護正義”、</p>

<h3>財部注意債市</h3>
<p>檢查銀行賬目</p>
<p>自華北局勢混沌後、一般不顧國家利害之投機家、竟乘機操縱公債市塲、致人心甚為不安、財政主管當局、已得悉此種情形、除嚴行澈查、澄清市塲外、並决派員來滬、檢查各銀行帳目、</p>
<p>財孔關切</p>
<p>奉派出使海外之財政部長孔祥熙氏、自蘆溝橋事件發生、曾迭電次長徐堪、善為主持財政金融、並隨時藉國際無綫電話之便、與徐氏通話、指示應付機宜、及取締債市之投機、安定債市切實辦法、</p>
<p>决予澈查</p>
<p>財部次長徐堪、自接孔財長之電令後、曾一度的與各界領袖、宣示孔財長之宗旨、並請各界協力安定外、一面復飭財部主管司、迅即派員來滬、檢查各銀行帳目、以憑核辦、俾澈底取締投機操縱之奸徒、使公債市塲、得以澄淸、</p>
<p>金融安定</p>
<p>昨據本市金融界消息、當茲中日空氣緊張華北局勢不安之際、本市金融情况、活潑而甚穩定、並未受任何影響、此卽為政府與人民連擊之密切、金融界更切實的協助政府、有以致之、蓋法幣準備充實、公債信用卓著、早為中外所共信、</p>
<p>三行套利</p>

<p>麵粉公會防止出口　運往北洋應有證明</p>

<p>禁止出口</p>
<p>自經財政部令飭海關、所有麥粉一項暫行禁止由滬出口、運往外地及轉口後、各輪已將麥粉裝輪者、一律為海關所截扣、至於麵粉公會亦為防止奸商另有企圖起見、已通告各廠、凡有購麵粉運往北洋者、應鄭重處置、不論民用軍用、均應有可靠之證明、卽其他雜糧運往北洋者、亦應有正式機關或法團證明、惟自海關扣留出口麵粉後、本市麵粉廠商得推派代表向財政部請示關於確保本國軍民所自用者之運輸辦法、</p>
<p>非常準備</p>
<p>最近時局真相、撲朔迷離、本市糧食界為準備萬一計、對此極為注意、按目前本市市民每日所需米糧約一萬二千擔、現有存底、足抵二月、但如不幸而事態擴大、糧食之準備、必當充實、故本市糧食界已在積極準備非常時期之糧食問題、如一旦有事、人民對國家、更應盡其應盡之義務、事先應有充分糧食之準備、事後對於糧食運輪上之便利、要從本位做起、各盡其力、封於一般奸商、希乘機圖利者、尤應加以切實防範、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>捐款不應停止</h3>
<p>— 蕭梅</p>
<p>宋哲元先生以“本軍守土有責，分所當然“為理由，把各方捐款退回來以後，各方的疑懼更加深了，尤其是像我輩無知小民，因為一時摸不着頭腦，更不禁羣情惶惑，以為宋先生果眞有“受之有愧”之心，那麼華北局面，豈非轉多困難；現在讀了二十九軍駐滬辦事處的說明，謂宋氏曾屢對人表示，過去馬占山與十九路軍之抗戰，各方捐款慰勞，其後紛紛捐款不能直達下級士兵等煩言，宋氏認為軍隊係國家所供養，本有應得之餉，抗敵為軍人天職，不應再受人民額外之賜，亦所以表示為國之苦心也云云。才知道宋氏原來有他“苦心”，而拒收捐款，正是表示他的“潔身自好”。過去援助馬占山與十九路軍的捐款，小民們似乎也並沒有計較這些“煩言”，因為他們的抗敵是事實；而前敵將士因民衆的慷慨輸將而士氣益為奮發，也是事實；人民所求者，抗敵而已，能抗敵者，雖死無怨，區區金錢，何足道哉！而一二八之役，人民因捐輸之便，與下級士兵打成一片，親如手足，更是我們永不能忘却的好敎訓；二十九軍的兄弟們在喜峯口喋血於前，宛平事變，又能繼續抗禦於後，這樣的好兄弟，我們能坐視不救？我們能不藉一點菲薄的錢物來表示無限的深慮？</p>
<p>“捐款不能直達下級士兵等煩言”，自然是賢明的高級長官所不願聞的。但即是事實，也祇是方法上問題。宋氏賢明，自然明白；而也正因為“煩言”之來也，我們該用事實來答覆“煩言”，祇要“問心無愧”就可不理這一套。大丈夫所為，原是求一心安而已，旁又何求？而現在，則因為捐款的被退回，在人民方面，引起了疑懼，在敵人方面，則正好多一散佈謠言，挑撥離間的機會。“苦心”未遂，而是非生矣。要不然，人民豈是傻瓜，情願讓花花白白的金錢供人中飽？</p>
<p>而也因為宋氏的拒收捐款，我們就觀望不前，這也是一種錯誤。我們要慰勞的，是整個抗敵守土的二十九軍的兄弟們，而並非是宋哲元先生一人；將來如保衛民族戰爭展開，則要慰勞的將是全體的抗敵將士，而並非單限於二十九軍；那麼，將來捐款的用途正大，現在豈可因一二人的拒收而就停止？我們知道慰勞的作用，與其說是物質上的援助，還不如說是精神上的激勵來得確當，而因少許物質的媒介，與前綫的抗敵兄弟們互通聲氣，更是前例俱在，那麼，捐款運動更豈可以停止！我們所要表示者，則正是有限的在前綫的兄弟們之外，他們的背後還站有舉國一致的民衆，而前綫和後方，並且已密切的携起手來！</p>
<p>日方一方面在天津和冀察政會諸公在進行所謂“和平”談判；一方面又以調動大軍四十萬來作威脅，侵略的準備；電訊所傳，所謂和平談判內容，又紛然其說，使人莫明眞相；我們除響應天津一千餘市民的通電，反對屈辱和平之外，我們還要大聲疾呼；不應停止捐款！</p>
<p>為了明日的中國，我們是該和前綫的抗敵將士們取一致態度的，我們要抗戰到底，我們要把中國的敵人趕出中國領土之外！</p>
<h3>又要屈服嗎？</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>自日軍向蘆溝橋放出第一砲，中日軍隊，連日不斷發生衝突，一時造成萬分危急的局面。然而在兩軍對壘的形勢下，雙方外交當局，仍努力折衝，為和平奔走。據最近傳來消息，大局已有趨緩和的傾向。大家聽到這一消息，或許要眉飛色舞，以為危機得以挽回。但是我却反而增加悲觀！</p>
<p>據負責進行談判者稱，當前的急務，應使兩方軍隊，各自後退，距離稍遠，以避免繼續“摩擦”。這方法自然不錯，然而這次接觸，釁由日啟，對方退軍則合理，我方退軍則不可。一國軍隊，受外國駐軍攻擊，還要屈服，試問這尚有主權可說嗎？</p>
<p>從過去的經騐，中日發生一回衝突，結果吃虧的總是我國。我這次事件，若果和平解决，故欲斷言，至少華北要任日方自由控制。對方旣動手，沒有取得相當的代價，决不肯輕易罷休。但是我国這一損失，却眞不算小呵！</p>
<p>和平解决以後，中日兩國，或可相安無事。然而這種局面，是一時的。中日關係，對方的侵略政策一日不改變，糾紛便一日沒法避免。今日的和平，保</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>不住明天的衝突。那末“摩擦”一次，我國喪權一次。中國難大，鞏也經不起野心無正境的宰割！</p>
<p>故我國應付的途徑，只有抗戰！自然我也明白，中日兩國，實力懸殊，輕易主戰是危險的。然而戰雖不是我國之福，和更非我國之利。儘管當局聲明，决不作有辱國家的談判，但是我相信，不附條件的解决，在這嚴重的情勢下，無論如何談不到。惟有抗戰，才可以從死里求生存。况對方數年來的壓迫，已使我國沒有喘息的餘地。這時再屈服，國家的前途，就不堪設想了！</p>
<p>外交折衝，現下正在進行中。我希望大家嚴密監視，看當局將用什麼方法，做到不喪權的解决。蘆溝橋事件，是我國生死關頭。我國的生路在這里，死路也在這里。一經走錯，整個民族的運命，怕要陷入萬劫不復的慘境！</p>
<h3>電車上</h3>
<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>為了一點些微的小事，我們是習慣着一種滑稽的爭論；在爭論的絮語中，我們已忘記了車經過了些甚麼地方。等到我們的爭論停息了以後，車已在南京路，向西的爬行着了。</p>
<p>約莫靜穆了幾分鐘，一個新的刺激又引起我們中間的滑稽的糾紛。</p>
<p>“你看！”——開始是我帶着善意的簡單的話句。</p>
<p>“那值得甚麼看？”</p>
<p>“你的脾氣老是這樣，”在一句不令自己愉快的反問語下，我也顯得不客氣了。“你以為不值得看也看看吧！”</p>
<p>“又是我的脾氣？——這不過是一個母親和她的六個女兒罷了。”</p>
<p>這不過是一個母親和她的六個女兒罷了：</p>
<p>母親才不過三十多歲，女兒們是如果站起隊來，剛巧是一個高一個，照我的短拙的眼力來看，卽使年齡不相彷，大概也不會相差太遠；而且她們的面貌是這麼相像：一個母親和她的六個女兒</p>
<p>“六個！一個年輕的母親便養了六個女兒，也許還有兒子。“我望了一下甚麼也不在乎的我那朋友。我的話是從喉邊一直吞到肚裏去，咕嚕地說給自己聽。……</p>
<p>忽然，她們中間的聲音打斷了我的胡思亂想。</p>
<p>“死丫頭，靠這兒來吧！……啊，謝謝，先生！……還不死來，你這賤種！……你又吵甚麼？……”</p>
<p>“媽，到了嗎？”</p>
<p>“媽，我坐！她搶我的，我……”</p>
<p>“媽，我脚痛啊！”</p>
<p>“你不站穩一點！車子里蕩得厲害，挨近媽這兒吧！……脚痛？坐到媽這兒來！……唉，眞是！……靠媽一點，不要阻別人的路。……你看，你這鼻涕蟲，……”</p>
<p>母親是坐靠門邊的角落，一個頂小的坐在她的懷裏。頂大的一個約莫八九歲站着，背靠着門；次一歲的站在她的姊姊的前面；再次一歲的，更站在面前。其餘兩個，是剛才一個乘客起立讓座時擠有媽媽的身邊。</p>
<p>“要是兒子，那眞够福氣，眞是！”坐在我們旁邊的一個老婆婆在同情和感傷地說着。後來却不知怎樣，她和那母親搭訕着了。</p>
<p>“咳，孩子多眞累贅！……你，還不坐好，……你不坐定，我揍死你這臭丫頭。……眞討厭啊！”</p>
<p>“你的福氣啊：一年一個，還是三年兩個？</p>
<p>“三年兩個！挨，都是賠錢貨，中屁用……你，不聽我說，擠在那兒，哼！……不過，今年要是養個小弟弟，……不耍擠，站着吧！</p>
<p>“我隔壁的阿嫂，也眞够福氣喇，去年養了一個，今年的一個也快滿月了。說不定明年也養一個胖胖的弟弟。……”</p>
<p>“那是前世修來的福了……咳，你沒有脚跟嗎？我的脚給你靠痛了。……到了，到了。不要心焦。我眞給你們六個累死咧！……唉，不是嗎，看人養弟弟眞像母鷄生蛋那麼容易喇，要是我也養一個，……咳，不知有這福氣沒有呢？”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>她們的談話聲給停車站的老槍報販呌賣聲蓋上了，而那七個面貌非常相像的母親和她的女兒，在這一站下了車。電車為了她們，在站上多停了幾分鐘。而在車已開動了時，我瞧着站台的眼睛才看到了這一個偉大的母親：她的瘦削的臉龐是刻着很深的勞苦的皺紋的。</p>
<p>當我回轉頭來對着我那滿不在乎的朋友，正相用嘲笑的話句引起我們習慣的爭論時，却給他的一句很突然的話變得感傷了：</p>
<p>“女人的一生便是這樣了嗎？”</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Summons Hull to Discuss Far East Situation</h3>
<p>How to Maintain the Prestige of the Nine-Power Treaty; International Exchange of Views in Progress</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt summoned Secretary of State Hull to the White House today to discuss the Far East situation, especially concerning the American Neutrality Act. Afterwards, Hull told reporters that the crisis in North China remains serious, but there have been no new developments in the past 24 hours, so the United States does not need to take any definite decisions or policies yet. Hull also said that the policy declaration he announced yesterday had received the support of some other 20 republics in the Americas. Hull's declaration yesterday advocated national and international self-restraint, avoiding the use of force as a tool of politics, and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries, but did not clearly indicate whether it was directed at China or Japan. Furthermore, according to White House sources, the United States has not yet received any requests to take active action. (Central News Agency, 17th, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull issued a written statement to the press yesterday, explaining the United States' willingness to cooperate with other countries in maintaining world peace. He also issued a supplementary declaration, stating that his call for peace has been echoed by the countries of South America. In short, his declaration aims to draw a line between international anarchy and international order. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>[Moscow] Chinese Ambassador to Russia Jiang Tingfu recently presented a note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute in North China to People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Litvinov. Afterwards, Ambassador Jiang issued a statement, explaining that the Chinese government's note was simultaneously delivered to the governments of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington (except for Japan). The Soviet Union is not a signatory to the Nine-Power Treaty, but the note was also delivered to them because any important issue concerning the Far East cannot allow the Soviet Union to stand aside and remain indifferent. However, if the Chinese government only delivered the note to the Soviet Union, some people might have political and ideological misunderstandings. The Chinese government simultaneously delivered the note to the German government to avoid such misunderstandings. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Comment That the US Should Intervene</h3>
<p>[Paris] Local newspapers have recently commented on the importance of the United States' attitude towards the Far East situation. The Radical Socialist Party's L'œuvre stated that U.S. President Roosevelt may implement the Neutrality Act once war breaks out between China and Japan, which would not be to Japan's advantage, as it is easier for Japan to send its ships and buy goods from the United States with cash. (Note: According to the Neutrality Act, belligerent countries are not prohibited from purchasing goods from the U.S. with cash and transporting them on their own ships.) However, "This may not be enough to hinder Japan. The country can still send ships to the United States to purchase various goods for use against China within a few weeks. People around President Roosevelt are saying that the articles of the Neutrality Act are numerous and that the United States has no shortage of legal experts who can interpret them in a way that allows President Roosevelt to prevent America's traditional enemy, Japan, from taking supplies from the United States and from forming an empire with a population of 200 million. If this is not done, this empire will be able to compete with the United States within a few years. Therefore, how President Roosevelt will use his discretion in the future on the issue of the implementation of the Neutrality Act is clear." The left-wing La République stated that the only way to maintain peace in East Asia is for the major powers, especially the United States, to intervene. Therefore, we must closely watch the actions of Washington. President Roosevelt is said to be very anxious and wants to force Japan to retreat from the precipice. The United States is best suited to do this. (Central News Agency, 18th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Countries Cannot Ignore Damage to Interests</h3>
<p>[London] The Sunday Times recently published an editorial titled "War Clouds in the Far East," stating that the outside world cannot ignore the events in China, because countries other than China all have extensive interests in China. We must now earnestly hope that the negotiations currently underway in Tianjin will ultimately result in a compromise solution. The Tokyo government has guaranteed that the current situation will not worsen. We sincerely hope that the facts will prove the correctness of this guarantee, but in the end, the Chinese side must not suffer damage to its prestige. (Central News Agency, 17th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Wang Zhengting Speaks on Sino-Japanese Problems</h3>
<p>Newsreel Filmed; To Be Shown in the US</p>
<p>[Washington] Paramount Pictures Corporation filmed a newsreel of a speech by our Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wang Zhengting, at our embassy in the United States this afternoon. The content generally covers the current Sino-Japanese dispute and will be shown next week. At that time, 40 million Americans will be able to listen to Ambassador Wang's speech. Mr. Wang's speech stated that the situation created by the Japanese army in North China is extremely serious. Peace in the Far East is currently in the balance. A large-scale conflict will inevitably affect the entire world. The purpose of the aggression by elements within the Japanese army in creating this serious situation is to complete their predetermined plan. We cannot ignore it. Furthermore, we must bear in mind that the Japanese army has no right, either morally or legally, to conduct exercises on Chinese soil. In the past few years, the Chinese government has adopted a policy of tolerance towards Japan's repeated provocations. Whether this crisis will lead to more serious consequences depends on the actions of Japan. The Chinese government is currently only taking defensive measures, like other governments. The Chinese government hopes that peace is still possible if it does not harm China's territorial integrity or dignity. However, if it is necessary to sacrifice for the survival and independence of the nation, it is prepared to make the greatest sacrifice. (Central News Agency, 17th)</p>

<h3>Jiaohai Customs Intercepts Large Batch of Smuggled Cigarette Paper</h3>
<p>Many Koreans Attempted to Retake It; Assaulted Our Police at the Wharf</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Because some Korean ruffians have recently been smuggling goods in the vicinity of Qingdao, Jiaohai Customs dispatches personnel to patrol the sea every day to prevent smuggling. At 2:00 PM on the 7th of this month, Customs Inspector Chen Futang took several sailors on a small steamship Shuanqing to patrol Shuiling Mountain Island. At around 3:00 AM on the 8th, they discovered a smuggling ship unloading smuggled goods near the island. They immediately went to intercept it, seizing a total of 232 pieces of cigarette paper, each containing 10 packs, worth approximately 20,790 yuan. Six Koreans were driving the ship, and they immediately fled with the cargo.</p>
<p>After intercepting the smuggled goods, Customs Inspector Chen Futang immediately rushed them to Qingdao and handed them over to Shanhai Customs for confiscation. At 10:00 AM on the 8th, they arrived at the first pier of the Qingdao Fire Port and were unloading the items one by one. Unexpectedly, more than 30 Koreans suddenly arrived, all armed and looking fierce, as if facing a formidable enemy. Upon arriving at the pier, without asking for reasons, they first dispersed the coolies, intending to seize all the smuggled goods. Soon, our police arrived to maintain order and urged them to disperse. However, the Koreans were unreasonable and surrounded our police, assaulting and insulting them. The police sub-bureau of the Haixi District telegraphed the Japanese consulate, and several Japanese policemen were dispatched from the consulate to suppress the situation, finally dispersing the Koreans. As a result, two of our policemen were seriously injured, and two bundles of smuggled cigarette paper were seized.</p>
<p>After this incident occurred, the police bureau reported the incident to the municipal government and sent personnel to the Japanese consulate to lodge a protest, demanding: ⑴ The Japanese consulate must be responsible for returning the cigarette paper seized by the Koreans to Jiaohai Customs for confiscation. ⑵ The Koreans involved in the incident must be strictly controlled. ⑶ Guarantees must be made that similar incidents will not occur again in the future. It is said that a satisfactory resolution has been reached and that this disturbance will soon be calmed. (8th)</p>

<h3>National Defense Line (16)</h3>
<p>— Our Special Correspondent, Shu Di</p>
<p>㊇ “Advocate Justice Group”</p>
<p>The rise of this popular organization with a strong political nature has its own special environmental background.</p>
<p>At that time (summer of the 24th year). The Shanxi authorities had exhausted their efforts to finalize the "Ten-Year Construction Plan of Provincial Administration," which was just about to be implemented. At this moment, the communist armed forces suddenly reached northern Shaanxi and planned to invade Shanxi. Such a situation, in a short period, really left Shanxi at a loss.</p>
<p>What was the situation in Shanxi at that time? On the one hand, it had four million farming households, of which 1.2 million were potential targets for becoming communist. The communist appeal was to use the estimated 300 million yuan in assets and 1.2 million armed peasants that Shanxi could provide as a new base for communism. On the other hand, Shanxi's military strength was only 100,000 at the time. How effective such a number of troops could be in fighting the Red Army was a very questionable matter.</p>
<p>"A danger within! A danger within!" The Shanxi authorities repeatedly expressed their grievances here and there. They once appealed to the people with these words: "The communist bandits make us weaker and poorer. They hold us back in our struggle against foreign countries. This is helping foreign countries to destroy China! If we want to save the country, we must first prevent communism!"</p>
<p>However, the stubborn communist forces, militarily, advanced into Shanxi with a "sweeping" momentum; in their work of spreading communism, they adopted an "omnipresent" posture, proceeding simultaneously on both fronts. In the end, even Taiyuan declared martial law.</p>
<p>The situation in Shanxi, which had been relatively stable for more than twenty years, experienced unprecedented upheaval. This upheaval forced the Shanxi authorities to shout the slogan "Total Mobilization to Prevent Communism." The content of the slogan was: "Prevent communism ideologically, prevent communism through the people, prevent communism politically, prevent communism militarily."</p>
<p>According to the Shanxi authorities' research, they believed that there were two main reasons why Shanxi was most vulnerable to communist infiltration: one was the "large gap of private land ownership" and the other was the "small gap of social inequality." In order to remedy the first so-called "large gap," they planned the "public ownership of village land" method and submitted it to the central government for decision. In order to remedy the second so-called "small gap," they came up with two emergency measures: ㊀ "Implementing reasonable burdens," ㊁ "Organizing the people, training the people."</p>
<p>Among the four aspects of the so-called "total mobilization to prevent communism," in the ideological aspect, they tried their best to refute the errors of communism; in the military aspect, they requested the central government to send large armies into Shanxi. According to estimates at the time, the communist strength in northern Shaanxi was only about 20,000 "Red Army" soldiers and over 200,000 "Red Guards," with more than 10,000 rifles. In these two aspects, they were more than capable of resisting communist armed destruction. The most problematic and pressing issues were the "political prevention of communism and the prevention of communism through the people."</p>
<p>Regarding the political and social inequality in Shanxi at that time, let us quote the Shanxi authorities themselves: "Currently, there are many civil and military officials and relatives of gentry families in various localities who abuse their power and act tyrannically in the villages. Local officials, considering personal relationships, not only do not suppress the relatives of officials and gentry families but also shield them. As a result, minor officials and lesser gentry's relatives are unreasonable in small matters, while major officials and greater gentry's relatives are unreasonable in large matters. This is the common phenomenon of social inequality. Secondly, corrupt officials deceive the people, and the army disturbs the people, etc. This provides the communists with more material to publicize the government's faults, causing the current government to lose popular support and faith and become a government without popular support." On the other hand, the communists seized upon these weaknesses in Shanxi and carried out their communist work at an extraordinary speed. The situation caused great panic in Shanxi. We can also quote the Shanxi authorities themselves: "We can suppress communists who try to communize us by force. But we have no way to prevent communists who try to communize us through the people. You clearly know that a certain village has already turned red, but when you ask the village head, the village head says it hasn't. Because if the village head says it has, his whole family will be raided by the communists. If you send troops to suppress the village, the villagers will say that the communists have already run away, and it is good that the troops have come to stay. Even though the troops are stationed in his village, they cannot stop his relatives and friends from interacting with him. These people are the pioneers who communize his village. It can be seen that stationing troops cannot stop the development of communism; even to the point that he wants to communize our army. The reality is that we cannot prevent communism because we do not know about it, and even if we know about it, we have no way to stop it."</p>
<p>In order to remedy "social inequality," the Shanxi authorities had to be determined to rectify officialdom. In order to resist communist communism, they had to "organize the people and train the people." These were originally two different kinds of work, but they organized one group to shoulder both tasks. This was the so-called "Advocate Justice Group" organized at that time. This organization, from its inception, was tasked with the dual mission of "political prevention of communism and the prevention of communism through the people." Politically, it was responsible for supervising politics and rectifying official misconduct. On the other hand, it was responsible for "organizing good people and advocating justice," attempting to counter the communist organization based on class differentiation with this organization based on the distinction between good people and bad people. Therefore, the two slogans of the "Advocate Justice Group" at the beginning were: "Assist good officials, good gentry, and good people" and "Curb bad officials, bad gentry, and bad people."</p>
<p>The emergence and nature of the "Advocate Justice Group" were special in this way from the beginning. However, since the communists changed their strategy, especially after the outbreak of the War of Resistance and the recent completion of the "peaceful unification" efforts, the environment in Shanxi has changed somewhat, and it seems there is no longer a need to remember its initial mission. However, when outsiders mention the "Advocate Justice Group," they immediately think of its original intention to resist communism. So, how exactly did it come about to resist communism? In order for readers to understand the organization's origins, the reporter does not hesitate to disclose the information gathered, no matter how trivial, above.</p>
<p>From the second half of the 24th year, when the "Advocate Justice Group" was established, until now, it has been three years in terms of years, and almost two years in terms of actual days. During this time, it has been the most powerful and largest organization in Shanxi, and it has done a lot of work. Since the outbreak of war, from now on, it will definitely play an important role in the situation in Shanxi, which can also be asserted. If we want to understand Shanxi, we have to say that this is also one of the first objects we should understand. When the reporter was in Shanxi, I tried every means to gather information, and although what I got may not be complete; however, I am disclosing it here in several aspects, and I think readers can also get a glimpse.</p>
<p>First, the current organizational status of the "Advocate Justice Group" - this is a completely top-down organization: except for the "group leaders" who are elected by the "members" and then approved by the "village head"; the heads of all other levels of the organization are appointed by the higher authorities. ㊀ Its highest level is the "Chief Head" and the "Deputy Chief Head." The former is Mr. Ge Baichuan; the latter is Mr. Zhao Cilong. Next are six "Senior Committee Members." The current incumbents are: A Mr. Qiu Yangjun (Director of the Department of Civil Affairs). B Mr. Wang Ping (Director of the Department of Finance). C Mr. Fan Xiangli (Director of the Department of Construction) D Mr. Feng Sizhi (Former Director of the Department of Education). E Mr. Wang Huaiming (Chief Military Judge of the Pacification Office). F Mr. Li Jiang, Counselor of the Pacification Office ㊂ Next, there is one "Chief Secretary" and two "Deputy Chief Secretaries." ㊃ Next are several "Secretaries" (currently three) and six "Sections." The duties of these six sections are: First Section - General Affairs, Second Section - Organization, Third Section - Assessment, Fourth Section - Reporting, Fifth Section - Publicity, Sixth Section - Training. ㊄ In terms of cadre organization, below the "Chief Head" is the "County Branch": The "County Branch" has one "County Head," two "Deputy County Heads," one "Clerk," and several "District Heads." (These "District Heads" are set up according to the number of (various administrative districts), and are only responsible for guidance and liaison, without real power, and there is no name of the District Branch.) ㊅ Below the "County Branch" is the "Village Branch," which has one "Village Head," "Deputy Village Head," "Clerk," etc., and three "Officers." (However, a "Village" with more than five groups of members may add one "Deputy Village Head"; if there are more than two groups of "members" but less than five groups, one "Officer" may be added.) ㊆ Below the Village Branch is the group, with one "Group Leader" and four "Members," for a total of five people. The "Group Leader" is elected by the "Members" and approved by the "Village Head." ㊇ Each "Village Group" has one "Clerk." (Concurrently held by an elementary school teacher; if there are two or more elementary school teachers, one of them is designated to serve as the "Clerk," and the rest also serve as "Deputy Clerks") ㊈ Each "Village Group" has one to three "Instructors." (The village chief is the "ex officio instructor")</p>

<h3>A View on the Perilous Situation</h3>
<p>— Qi</p>
<p>The report on the 16th stated that as of 1:00 AM on the 16th, the peace situation had been stabilized. The day before yesterday, it was suddenly rumored that "the Japanese government has dispatched the 5th, 6th, 10th, 12th, and 16th Divisions to China." Yesterday, there were widespread rumors that "Japan has mobilized 400,000 troops and budgeted 10 million yuan for war expenses for a large-scale invasion." When we look at the news before and after, it seems contradictory, but in fact, under this kind of shimmering attitude of the Japanese side, there is indeed a sinister effect hidden. It is because the Japanese side wants to use the air of peace to relax our local morale and divide the unity between the local and central governments, and to alienate the people's love for the 29th Army. When Wakizaki and others contacted the local authorities a few days ago, rumors once spread like bees in Beijing and Shanghai. When Qin Dechun and others published three telegrams refuting the rumors, the general public's doubts were immediately dispelled. The 29th Army's representative stationed in Shanghai yesterday received reporters and reported on the current situation in Pingjin, which further proved the loyalty and bravery of all the officers and soldiers of the 29th Army in defending the country. The Japanese side also knows that our country's unity is no longer comparable to that before the September 18th Incident. They still vainly hope to lure the Pingjin authorities, considering it a local incident to negotiate directly. If the northern generals mistakenly fall into the trap, they can enter Pingjin without spending a single bullet or losing a single soldier, and bring the rivers and mountains of North China under their control. If this strategy fails, they will take a high-pressure approach, dispatch a large army into the pass, and adopt the so-called "fear of Japan" suggestion of Matsumuro Takayoshi, attempting to intimidate the 29th Army into forming an alliance under the city. If that is the case, the so-called "clarification of North China" can become a reality. However, since the Lugouqiao Incident, what the Japanese side has been uneasy about is the fear that its domestic economy is stretched thin and that European and American powers are closely watching. They are also at odds with Soviet Russia over two small islands in the Heilongjiang River. If China and Japan promote a major war, China will suffer irreparable losses, and Japan will also suffer considerable losses. If it is prolonged, there may be unexpected events. Therefore, the Japanese side is thinking of a quick way to end it. The quickest and most ingenious way is to threaten and entice, to subdue people without fighting. Therefore, all the so-called negotiations for peace, dispatching large armies, Japanese expatriates returning to their country, and not wanting third-country mediation are all their obvious effects. To say that peace is a delaying tactic is still a superficial view.</p>
<p>We, in the name of the Chinese people, clearly inform the Japanese authorities that peace is what we desire, but only if we do not lose our rights and dignity, and the Japanese side withdraws its troops unconditionally and guarantees that it will not provoke trouble for no reason in the future, can there be peace.</p>
<p>We also stand in the position of the people and respectfully inform the Pingjin authorities that the officers and soldiers of Lugouqiao and Tongxian have armed and protected the country, and the people are extremely admired. Although the Chinese and Japanese authorities in Tianjin have been constantly negotiating in recent days, and Song Zheyuan also had talks with Kashiki yesterday, as long as the promise of preserving sovereignty and not losing an inch of land is kept, we will not object to ending the crisis. If the Japanese side makes unreasonable demands and is determined to start a war, we hope that they will maintain the spirit of resistance at Xifengkou and win glory for the nation once again. All the people of our country will definitely devote all their efforts to provide strong support for our beloved 29th Army.</p>
<p>Finally, we also hope that the government will, in addition to ordering ambassadors stationed abroad to send notes to the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to urge them to pay attention, use the methods of peace contained in international law and treaties to resolve disputes with the Japanese side. On the other hand, we must also prepare for any eventuality, and not let the loyal and brave 29th Army bear the brunt of the fierce attack alone. We love peace, but we especially value sovereignty. We know that our government will, together with the people, swear to fight to the death rather than seek peace through humiliation or lose an inch of land.</p>
<h3>Former Governor-General of Vietnam Observes the Sino-Japanese Situation</h3>
<p>Japanese Aggression Will Meet Serious Resistance</p>
<p>[Paris] The former Governor-General of Vietnam, Socialist Congressman Phạm Lẽ Bát-Đạt, recently visited various parts of China for investigation and recently published a long article in "Le Paris Soir" on the origins of the Sino-Japanese disputes and their international impact, stating, "Although Japan has tried hard to avoid falling into Germany's trap, it still cannot avoid falling into Germany's trap today. Japan is involved in the Tripartite Pact (referring to the German-Italian-Japanese alliance), and its proposed tasks are nothing more than to contain a part of Russia's forces and keep them stationed in the Far East. Because the current European political situation is extremely complex and a war may break out at any time, Germany and Italy want to use Japan to divide the Soviet Union's forces. This can be proven by the recent incidents on the border between the Soviet Union and Manchuria. Japan, having the intention of nibbling away at China, first made a feint to the east and a strike to the west on the Soviet border. If the Soviet Union comes out to fight Japan, its position in Europe will be weakened as a result. On the contrary, if the Soviet Union does not intervene, Japan will be even more unscrupulous in conquering the entire North China. When the future war breaks out, Japan can have a solid base to fight against Russia. Moreover, the Japanese government had previously prepared to seek a friendly solution with the Chinese government on the issue of the Japanese army occupying the area around Beiping (referring to the Jidong puppet regime), but because the current cabinet is completely obedient to the military, the solution could not be started. The Japanese military intends to control the national government, so in the spring of this year, it forced the government to order the dissolution of the parliament. The results of the parliamentary re-election on April 30 proved that Japanese public opinion does not approve of the military's actions. However, the military did not follow suit. To the point where Japan's foreign policy came from the military's instructions. Last year's Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany was not actually signed by Japanese diplomats, but by representatives of the mountain army. Therefore, in terms of the current incident, whether the cannons fired at China were fired by Berlin is really impossible not to doubt." Phạm Lẽ Bát-Đạt continued, "This time Japan's actions will inevitably encounter serious resistance from China, because on the one hand, China has unlimited potential power, and on the other hand, China's current action ability is no longer comparable to what it was a few years ago. In terms of the Chinese army, it has obviously made great progress in recent years. Japan has already deeply felt that the Chinese army cannot be lightly insulted in the January 28 Shanghai War. Assuming that Japan must try lightly, it will inevitably lead to a long-term war, with many difficulties and high costs. In the end, Japan will inevitably obtain a lesson at a heavy price. What is this lesson? China has 400 million people and more than 2 million well-trained and fully equipped troops. It is not easy to destroy them." Finally, Phạm Lẽ Bát-Đạt explained France's views, saying, "France has absolutely no objection to Japan, but we have every reason to believe that China has peaceful intentions. China has no intention of threatening any other country. What it is striving for is nothing more than the work of national rejuvenation. This is why we cannot help but express our deep sympathy to China. In short, if the Japanese people can understand that their current rulers are driving their country into a path of adventure, or even collapse, then they will probably restore their clear reason and take measures to rein in their horses at the edge of the cliff," etc. (Central News Agency, Havana, 17th)</p>
<h3>British-German and British-Russian Naval Agreements</h3>
<p>Britain to Publish White Paper</p>
<p>[London] The British-German and British-Russian naval agreements will be published in the form of a white paper on Monday. It is reported that these two agreements will take effect simultaneously with the 1936 London Naval Treaty after the exchange of ratification documents. Because the London Naval Treaty will hold its second reading next Tuesday, it is expected that the new agreements will be approved by the end of this month. (17th National Maritime Telecommunications)</p>
<p>[London] After the signing of the British-German and British-Russian naval agreements, The Times commented on it on Sunday, saying, "When the United Kingdom and Germany concluded a naval treaty in June 1935 (stipulating that the total tonnage of the German navy should be 35% of the total tonnage of the British navy), they had a gentleman's agreement, stipulating that the maximum number of first-class cruisers that Germany could build should not exceed three, but on the condition that other countries should also not build this type of cruiser. Later, the Soviet Union began to build three or four 8,000-ton cruisers, and the caliber of its guns was set at 7 inches (note that the caliber of guns for 8,000-ton cruisers should be 6 inches, while 7 inches is the caliber of guns for first-class 10,000-ton cruisers). Germany believed that the spirit of the above-mentioned gentleman's agreement had been technically destroyed by the Soviet Union, so it did not fulfill it. Now that the new British-German agreement has been concluded, this gentleman's agreement is declared terminated, and Germany can invoke the escalator clause in the future to continue building first-class cruisers (note that the new agreement stipulates that Germany can build a total of five first-class cruisers). In short, the British government has shown the greatest patience in negotiating agreements with Germany and Russia this time before announcing their conclusion. The British Foreign Office has done a great job and deserves our admiration. In addition, since Japan has not joined the 1936 London Naval Treaty, it is impossible to know how strong its naval power is, but the naval power of the United States, France, Germany, and Russia is all known because of the London Naval Treaty and the British-German and British-Russian agreements. This is already better than complete separation. Moreover, British officials also hope that Italy can also accept the various qualitative restrictions stipulated in the London Naval Treaty, and that even if Japan does not formally accept it, they at least hope that it will not deliberately violate it," etc. (Central News Agency, Havana, 18th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Speech Warns Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>Says British Strength Now Far Greater Than Before Mysterious Aircraft Discovered Over London</p>
<p>[London] Supporters of the National Government recently held a public meeting in Lytellboro, which was attended by Prime Minister Chamberlain, who gave a speech, stating, "Britain today is far stronger than it was a few years ago, and it is now growing stronger. Our air force is now comparable to the air force of any other country in the world, and there is no need to worry." He continued, "Everyone knows that our country's military affairs will never be used for the purpose of aggression. If other countries want to engage in aggression, then if they estimate the military strength to oppose such aggression, and if they consider all the resources and strength of our British armament, they will definitely hesitate and dare not try lightly." In addition, the Prime Minister publicly criticized the attitude of the Labour Party members in the House of Commons towards the Spanish issue, saying that the Labour Party members always demanded collective action, but before the adjustment committee had discussed the compromise plan proposed by the United Kingdom for the non-intervention plan in the Spanish civil war, they actually demanded that it be submitted to the House of Commons for discussion. How self-contradictory it is. Finally, when talking about social issues, the Prime Minister said that the government should fight to relieve the poor and improve public health, etc. (Central News Agency, Havana, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] A mysterious aircraft often appears over the city of London at night, especially last night, which is somewhat frightening. The House of Commons has now decided to discuss this matter within the next week. The Sunday Public Opinion newspaper recently published this news with a shocking headline, saying that this mysterious opportunity was flying over the Parliament and St. Paul's Church at 0:45 this morning, dropping four fake bombs from a height of 10,000 feet. The crew also used wireless radio to notify the air force personnel, saying that this move was to prove that London's air defense facilities were completely ineffective, and that they did not know when they would come again.

<h3>German-Italian Joint Anti-Communist Movement</h3>
<p>Exhibition Opens in Berlin</p>
<p>⊙ Stuttgart, Germany. An "Anti-Bolshevik" exhibition was held here and opened today. General Truschiovoli of Italy gave a speech, vehemently attacking Bolshevism, saying, "Bolshevism is completely different from the political systems of Germany and Italy. There is no possibility of compromise between the two. We must completely eliminate the consequences that Bolshevism may produce." When talking about the Soviet dictator Stalin, he called him "the Red Tsar," saying that he grew up on the Russian plains and lived a miserable life, so he was extremely cruel and sinful, with countless crimes. Fortunately, Germany and Italy exist. In the future, our two countries should unite in the Mediterranean region to prevent the Bolshevik Party from invading the Mediterranean coast. This is the promise that our two countries solemnly bear in the names of Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini." (Central News Agency, Havana, 17th)</p>
<h3>Italy Aids the Spanish War</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Admits Without Reservation</p>
<p>[London] Labour Party member of the House of Commons, Lansbury, recently visited Rome to meet with Mussolini for talks, and recently gave a speech at the London Federation of the Peace Protection Committee, expressing trust in Mussolini's words, "On the Spanish issue, Mussolini is convinced that the intervention of Germany and Italy in the Spanish civil war will stop one day, and he is also convinced that Germany and Italy will never lightly start a war with the rest of Europe for Spain." When talking about the non-intervention issue in the Spanish civil war, Mussolini admitted that Italy did indeed send volunteer soldiers and a large amount of military supplies to aid the Spanish National Army in waging war against the atheist Bolshevik Party.

<h3>Argentina Does Not Intend to Participate in the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Conference</h3>
<p>Brazil Has Not Received a British Invitation</p>
<p>● Buenos Aires, Argentina. When the adjustment committee for the non-intervention plan in the Spanish civil war is currently meeting in London, the Italian representatives will advocate inviting South American countries to participate in the adjustment committee. Regarding this matter, the official court of Argentina recently believed that the country's presidential election campaign is about to begin, and must be concluded in September. Politicians do not want to cause international problems during this period. Therefore, Argentina will not accept the proposal to participate in the adjustment committee. (Central News Agency, Havana, 17th)</p>
<p>● Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. According to news from London, the British government had invited Brazil to participate in the adjustment committee for the Spanish non-intervention plan. This news was recently denied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Central News Agency, Havana, 17th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Anti-Religious Movement Revives</h3>
<p>Newspapers Sing the Praises of Atheism</p>
<p>[Moscow] The agitation against religion in the Soviet Union seems to be reviving. Various anti-religious newspapers have recently been vigorously promoting atheism, urging people not to believe in religion. The Communist Party's official newspaper, Pravda, has also published articles advocating the anti-religious movement, repeatedly warning against the resurgence of rural church power. Furthermore, an article published in Izvestia explaining the issue of religious propaganda in relation to the new constitutional provisions is particularly interesting. According to the newspaper, a priest on a ship traveling between Kalinin and Upper Volga loudly recited the Bible to the passengers. The passengers protested, and the priest replied that religious propaganda was permitted under the new constitution. The passengers were speechless. However, Izvestia commented that various interpretations of the new constitution were incorrect. Article 124 of the new constitution stipulates that all citizens have "freedom to perform religious rites and freedom to engage in anti-religious propaganda," but the constitution does not mention freedom to engage in religious propaganda.

<h3>US Judicial Reform Bill</h3>
<p>Government's Victory Hopes in Congress Are Slim</p>
<p>[Washington] Since the death of Senator Robinson, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, disagreements over his replacement have intensified, particularly due to the Supreme Court reform bill. There are reportedly three possible outcomes for the Supreme Court reform bill, but the President has little hope of achieving victory in this session of Congress. One possibility is that the administration will compromise. Another is that the opposition will send the bill back to the Judiciary Committee for further consideration, delaying it for at least a year. The third is that even if the Senate passes the bill, it will not be sent to the House of Representatives. The contenders to become the Democratic majority leader in the Senate are Barkley and Harrison. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 17th)</p>

<h3>Spanish Defense Minister Declares to Fight for Independence and Freedom</h3>
<p>High Morale Seeking Final Victory Two Italian Divisions Sent to Reinforce Suburbs of Madrid</p>
<p>Madrid Defense Minister Prieto delivered a radio address to the nation's army, navy, and air force yesterday afternoon, stating: "Today, our army is not only fighting against the rebels but also against countries that openly support the rebels, namely Germany, Italy, and Portugal. We originally fought for liberation, and now we fight for independence. This is the greatest glory for our army. What we seek day and night is independence and freedom, and we will never be slaves to anyone." He then criticized all forms of tyranny, especially foreign tyranny, calling it "the worst form of tyranny." He concluded by saying that "We are fighting a war of resistance to suppress the rebellion. In fact, being able to resist is victory. But we must win quickly so that the people will not suffer further and the national economy will not collapse further." (Central News Agency, Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Madrid Government observers stated today that 15,000 to 20,000 Italian troops have arrived on the Madrid front to assist the Nationalist forces. The government army's general staff reportedly welcomes the concentration of elite Nationalist forces. Today marks the first day of the second year of the Spanish Civil War. Government aircraft bombed the Nationalist front lines early this morning, and government troops then launched a surprise attack, reportedly capturing over a mile of territory on both sides of the Toledo highway. The morale of the government troops is very high, but they are quite indignant about the London Non-Intervention movement because the government army believes that Britain's new proposals are intended to test international attitudes in order to prepare to grant the Nationalist forces the rights of a belligerent power. (Guomin News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>⊙ Hendaye The Spanish government army's offensive west of Madrid seems to be losing momentum. The center of the war is now in the Aragon region, where the two sides have not yet confronted each other and there has been no real change. Yesterday, 1,500 Catalan troops, with 30 tanks and 16 aircraft, attacked the Nationalist positions north of Huesca. Both sides claim victory. Furthermore, the Nationalist forces celebrated the first anniversary of the civil war yesterday. In Salamanca, there was a bullfight, shops were closed, and people flocked to the streets to watch. There were also concerts and various gatherings, creating a grand spectacle. Today, the celebrations continue with religious processions and the renaming of a street as General Franco Street, as well as bullfights and a broadcast speech by Franco, creating a semblance of peace and prosperity. (Central News Agency, Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid Nationalist aircraft bombed government army positions near the town of Villafranca del Castillo, northwest of the capital, throughout the night, dropping many incendiary bombs. They launched an attack from dawn today, attempting to drive back the government troops. Fierce fighting ensued, and the government troops resisted strongly, without giving ground. In addition, Nationalist aircraft attempted to bomb the central area of the capital, but were driven away by government army anti-aircraft fire. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Spanish President Delivers Solemn Speech on Civil War Anniversary</h3>
<p>Suffering Foreign Military Invasion Resolves to Appeal to League of Nations Again</p>
<p>⊙ Valencia Today is the first anniversary of the civil war. President Azaña delivered a speech at the university, stating that he would appeal to the League of Nations again. He said that the rebels would have been suppressed long ago without foreign aid, and that Spain was being invaded by Portugal, Germany, and Italy. He had previously appealed to the League of Nations without making any demands, simply informing them that one of the League's member states was being invaded by foreign troops, and that was all. He said that he still firmly believes that the voices of small and weak countries will eventually be heard, and therefore will appeal to the League of Nations again. He then criticized the London Adjustment Committee, calling its attitude towards the withdrawal of foreign volunteers "the height of absurdity," and expressed dissatisfaction with the proposal to recognize the rebels as a belligerent power. He stated that the Adjustment Committee should not replace the League of Nations, but it is paralyzing it. The Adjustment Committee's so-called non-intervention work is nothing more than obstructing the League of Nations' actions. The Adjustment Committee only knows how to protect the interests of the five major European powers, while disregarding the rights that the legitimate government of Spain should enjoy. The monitoring plan it formulated has been delayed and not implemented until the rebels have replenished their arms to a considerable extent, and then a certain country discovered that the rebels' arms were still not sufficient, so it launched the Almeria incident to sabotage the monitoring plan. Now, some people want to recognize our legitimate government as a belligerent power, which is a good thing, but if they simultaneously recognize the rebels as a belligerent power, it would be the worst kind of interference in internal affairs. Regarding the withdrawal of foreign volunteers, we sincerely agree, but as far as we are concerned, all those who are not Spanish citizens are foreigners and must be withdrawn. Since the Sultan of Morocco is not a member of the London Adjustment Committee, the Moroccan troops who are helping the rebels are traitors to the protectorate and should not be tolerated. On the contrary, foreigners who join the government army are true volunteers who come without being recruited and are not forced to come. This is very different from the volunteers on the rebel side. If we do not distinguish between them and treat them lightly, we cannot accept it. President Azaña concluded by saying that everything they have done is in accordance with justice and fairness, and that they now have a strong Republican army that will surely defeat the enemy. The speech was broadcast by radio to all regions, and the audience here applauded enthusiastically for a long time. (Central News Agency, Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Plot to Overthrow Provisional Government Fails Due to Lack of Secrecy</p>
<p>⊙ Hendaye The Santander government army radio station reported today that a rebellion conspiracy had occurred in the Spanish rebel-controlled cities of Burgos, Seville, and R'la Manga, to overthrow General Franco's provisional government and replace it with a government composed of the military and civilians. They would then seek to approach the Valencia government based on rejecting foreign interference. However, one of the leaders failed to maintain secrecy, leading to exposure. Hundreds of suspects, including officers and civilians, have been arrested, and many have fled to Gibraltar. (Guomin News Agency, 17th)</p>

The manager of the shipping company to which the "Gauntlettsenburg" belongs stated that the ship was anchored off Santander yesterday, preparing to enter the port to carry refugees out of the country. There are 23 crew members on board. (Central News Agency, Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3>Air Defense and Gas Defense (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>Then the movie clip described the situation when testing the gas mask in the gas chamber. (The gist is that police inspector Moses lit a gelatinous sac filled with gas on a brazier. After a while, the sac melted, and the poisonous gas filled the entire room. However, before lighting it, he pierced the sac with a pin to prevent the gas from exploding upon contact with fire and splashing onto the skin, which would cause blisters. Several policemen wearing gas masks reported their feelings from inside the masks. They all said: It was only a bit difficult to breathe, it was harder to speak, and the skin around their necks felt a bit irritated because it was tender, but otherwise they didn't feel any discomfort.)</p>
<p>The representative also said: Today, we visited the gas chamber of the Nottingham Police Department to observe Police Inspector Moses and several police students conducting formal training. We recorded snippets of his instructions and the students' questions and answers as follows:</p>
<p>Moses said: You see it has melted, and the room is now filled with tear gas. You see that the four walls and the ceiling of this room are painted very white. If you could see the gas, you could see it very clearly. But you don't see anything now. Don't think that there is no gas in here. There is indeed gas. If you don't put on your respirators, you will feel very uncomfortable right now. Let me test you. Everyone shake your heads and see if the respirators are on correctly. Are your eyes clear?</p>
<p>The students replied: Very clear.</p>
<p>Moses said: That shows that your respirators are all on correctly. If it were not right at this time, you would not be able to see your eyes, your face would be covered with tears, and you would want to run outside.</p>
<p>After we finished the test, we went to the top floor of the police station and saw a group of young policemen, with tears in their eyes, sniffing bottles containing the original elements of poisonous gas. The smell was like simple things such as dried grass and garlic, but those were the smells of mustard gas, green charcoal, and tear gas. (End of radio speech)</p>
<p>From the above speech, it seems that everyone in the UK will be able to get a gas mask in the near future. They are now stored by the government and will be distributed to them free of charge when the war breaks out. Gas chambers are also being set up everywhere to test the effectiveness of gas masks, so as to avoid negligence in an emergency. Not only is the UK doing this, but according to German Aviation Minister General Goering, the German government has already distributed gas masks to the people in Berlin, Hamburg, and other places, and it will soon be promoted nationwide. There are several types of gas masks for men, women, and children. General Goering said in a speech on German aviation equipment at the Berlin Olympic Stadium on May 5: "Once a war breaks out, men will serve on the battlefield, and women should take on the task of air defense in the rear."</p>
<p>The most terrible thing in an air raid, besides poisonous gas, is incendiary bombs, which are also the most important thing in air defense. Recently, the Shanghai Times published a piece of news about the British plan to defend against incendiary bombs as follows:</p>
<p>"The duties of the air raid emergency team in wartime have now been published by the British government with detailed recommendations. Military authorities believe that incendiary bombs are one of the most powerful weapons in air raids, so it is now extremely important to deploy a definite defense plan. The government's recommendations are based on this belief. However, in order for the defense against incendiary bombs to be truly effective, it requires the enthusiastic cooperation of the public to achieve its purpose. Therefore, it is now urgent to recruit volunteers to train them as fire fighting auxiliary teams, along with the fire department's inspectors. These teams can be regarded as the reserve army in peacetime. Recruitment and training must be divided into four categories: ㊀ fire fighting teams that serve full-time in emergencies, ㊁ fire fighting teams that take time out every day to serve, ㊂ men and women who manage the fire department, and ㊃ men and women who perform other miscellaneous tasks. These teams should need a total of about 200,000 people. Fire fighting auxiliary teams must undergo 60 hours of training to be applicable, but fire inspectors and patrols only need to receive basic training to be able to serve. Each district should have high-powered fire fighting equipment in suitable locations. The mobile patrol teams are prepared to patrol the streets during enemy air raids so that any fire can be extinguished at its inception. Nowadays, new large aircraft can carry 1,000 small incendiary bombs each. If each bomb is not dealt with immediately when it falls, it can easily cause a major fire. The government has also ordered local officials to draft a detailed plan for defending against incendiary bombs. Now the public knows that effective national defense is a matter of urgency, so the organization of suitable air defense auxiliary teams will definitely be completed in a short period of time." From this piece of news, we can know that the people have a responsibility to air defense, regardless of gender, age. According to recent news, women in major cities in the UK are now starting to receive air defense training. Naturally, men need not be said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the British War Office is also implementing the government's announced policy of preparing to convert the Internal Defense Force into an Air Defense Force. Many departments of the Internal Defense Force have declared their willingness to be reorganized. Therefore, the War Office published an article as follows: "The Army Council is very gratified by the public spirit expressed by the Internal Defense Force and their willingness to assume new responsibilities that are extremely important to national defense. The new air force war zone now requires such a team to be prepared to fight immediately at the beginning of the war, or even before the war begins. This is necessary to make the air defense equipment for defending the country to a very effective level. If we wait until after mobilization to train, there will be no opportunity. Therefore, the Council is willing to declare in this situation that the officers and soldiers of the Air Defense Force should be completely deployed in peacetime. The Council has no doubt that the Internal Defense Force and the relevant Internal Defense Force Association are aware of the importance of their new mission and are working hard to recruit personnel and consolidate their strength. However, their efforts will be difficult to succeed if the whole country does not support them. The Council would like to ask public groups and employers of labor, wherever there are air defense teams stationed near them, to provide all possible conveniences and encourage employees to join such teams. In addition to the two weeks of camp each year, they must also be given one or two weeks of vacation, but their salaries will be paid as usual. If this is done, it will be another expression of the goodwill and patriotism of our country."</p>
<p>After seeing how countries are preparing for air defense day and night, how can we be indifferent and not catch up quickly? Air defense is not just empty talk. Although air defense exhibitions that attract the public's attention are important, the entire nation must support the government in everything that should be done, and it should be implemented quickly so that it can be effective in wartime. If we wait until the enemy planes attack before rushing to deploy, that will not be considered air defense, it will simply be empty air defense.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Corpses Transported Back to Country</h3>
<p>Total Number Approximately Six Hundred Bodies Eight Assaults on Lugou Bridge Resulted in Most Deaths</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence, Regarding the number of deaths in the recent Lugou Bridge incident, the Japanese Army Command announced that each battle resulted in three or four deaths, or seven or eight deaths, with a total of no more than one hundred. However, from dawn on the 8th until dawn on the 13th, the successive charges were fierce. With one Lugou stone bridge, eight attempts to seize it failed. The number of deaths cannot be as low as one hundred. According to Japanese army practice, they must inspect the corpses after each battle and will not be satisfied with missing even one body. Regardless of the victory or defeat of the battle, the bodies of the deceased must be transported back to their country for cremation, and then the ashes will be transferred to the family members for separate worship. According to a survey by the Tianjin General East and West Railway Stations, on the afternoon of the 10th and the morning of the 11th, there were three corpse carriages of Japanese soldiers transported from Fengtai to Tianjin. On the evening of the 12th, there were four corpse carriages of Japanese soldiers that arrived in Tianjin. All corpses were transported to the Japanese Concession's Haiguang Temple via heavy vehicles. When the corpses were unloaded from the train and transferred to heavy vehicles, Japanese soldiers were heavily guarded, prohibiting Chinese people from approaching to observe. Therefore, details were unknown for several days. However, it was learned that many of these corpses were with their heads and bodies separated, and their limbs were incomplete. There were very few gunshot or artillery wounds. Because the Chinese and Japanese armies clashed in the suburbs of Peiping, our side only responded with the Big Sword Corps. Therefore, Japanese soldiers with severed heads and broken arms were everywhere. In order to preserve the corpses, the Japanese army headquarters specially mixed them with a large amount of salt to prevent them from rotting. On the morning of the 16th, the headquarters again used 30 heavy vehicles to transport the salt-pickled corpses from Haiguang Temple to the Grand Canal Wharf to transfer them to barges. They temporarily requested the British and French Concession authorities to clear the streets and drive away pedestrians when the corpse vehicles passed. It was later learned that there were 31 corpse vehicles in total, covered with cloth sheds, emitting a fishy odor and swarming with maggots. Each vehicle had at least 20 corpses. Therefore, it is known that there were at least 620 corpses in these 30 vehicles. This is a relatively accurate number. As for the number of Japanese soldiers killed at the front, it is feared that it is more than this. After the corpses were loaded onto barges at the Dalian Wharf, they were transported to Tanggu to transfer to ships back to their country. As for the wounded Japanese soldiers, those with serious injuries were treated at the Japanese military hospital in Fengtai, and those with minor injuries were transported to Tianjin. The wounded soldiers were already suffering from severe injuries, and adding the long-distance travel, they were extremely painful. The Japanese side's simple medical equipment and the perfunctory emergency care were beyond our expectations.</p>
<p>The main figures in this Japanese military action were Hezhi, the section chief of the Japanese Garrison Headquarters in Tianjin, Omoto, and Kabayama, the brigade commander, and other young and radical officers. They were impatient and extremely violent. Hezhi was especially so. Hezhi believed that occupying Wanping County and Lugou Bridge was a matter of a hand and a foot. He never expected that eight charges would fail. Now Hezhi and others are in a dilemma. In addition, since the 8th, the Japanese side has not made any progress on the front line. Lugou Bridge and Wanping County are still in the hands of the 29th Army. With so many officers and soldiers killed and injured, the conciliatory faction and the general sergeants deeply resent Hezhi, Omoto, and others. There is a possibility of internal strife. (16th)</p>

<p>Jinan Dispatch: Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu, considering the present extraordinary times, deeply fears that unscrupulous individuals may take the opportunity to spread rumors and confuse the public. He recently warned military and political personnel to diligently perform their duties and refrain from overstepping their authority to make reckless comments or speculate on the current situation. He also ordered military and police personnel to strictly inspect various hotels, brothels, and entertainment venues, cracking down on suspicious individuals to maintain local stability. The Provincial Capital Police Department and the Special Investigation Team of the Third Route Headquarters recently apprehended Guo Shimei and Wu Zhenting for spreading rumors and confusing the public. On the 15th, Han personally interrogated them, and both confessed without reservation to fabricating rumors, inciting people, and hoping to take the opportunity to riot. Thereupon, in accordance with the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China, the two criminals were verified to be the correct persons and shot at 5:00 PM that same day. A public notice was also issued to inform the public. The original text of the notice stated: "According to the Provincial Capital Police Department and this Headquarters' Special Investigation Team, Guo Shimei and Wu Zhenting, two individuals who spread rumors and confused the public, were apprehended and sent to this department. Upon interrogation, the criminals confessed without reservation to fabricating rumors, inciting people, and hoping to take the opportunity to riot. Considering that the current situation is unstable and the nation is facing many troubles, these criminals dared to fabricate facts with the intention of disrupting public order, which is a blatant disregard for the law. If they are not severely punished, it would be insufficient to deter evildoers and maintain local peace. Therefore, in accordance with Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Emergency Law for Punishing Acts Endangering the Republic of China, the criminals Guo Shimei and Wu Zhenting are sentenced to death and will be verified to be the correct persons and taken to the execution ground outside Nanxu Gate at 5:00 PM on the 15th of this month for execution by shooting as a clear warning. The charges are hereby announced to inform all sectors of society. This notice is hereby issued. The details are as follows: Guo Shimei, the criminal who spread rumors and confused the public, is 35 years old and from Linyi County, Shandong Province. Wu Zhenting is 52 years old and from Baoding, Hebei Province." (16th)</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Warships Arrive at Guangzhou Port</h3>
<p>Guangdong Authorities Strengthen Security on Land and Water; Yu Hanmou Flies to Zhangzhou to Inspect Troops</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The enemy has recently deployed heavy troops to Pingjin, putting severe pressure on us, and is using places like Taiwan and Xiamen as bases to contain Fujian and Guangdong. Therefore, Japanese warships have been frequently maneuvering in the southwest of Fujian and at ports like Shantou and Guangzhou in recent days. On the 12th, the "Yubari" and "Asagao," two Japanese warships stationed in Xiamen, again proceeded to Guangdong without authorization, arriving at Guangzhou Port on the morning of the 14th. The Japanese Consul in Guangzhou verbally stated that the two warships came to protect Japanese nationals and, if necessary, would sail into the Pearl River to anchor. The Guangdong authorities, upon receiving the report, have made adequate preparations. On the naval side, Chen Ce, commander of the Humen Fortress, personally inspected various fortresses and instructed his subordinates to fulfill their duty to defend the country and protect the people in this critical situation. On the diplomatic side, if the Japanese warships sail into our territory, a protest will be lodged with the Japanese Consul, stating the responsibilities. As for Guangzhou's security, the military police and police are responsible for maintaining it. The Provincial Capital Police Department, in order to prevent vagrant Japanese from infiltrating the interior and plotting disturbances, has issued a notice to all police stations to pay attention to the whereabouts of vagrant Japanese and traitors. If they are found mixing in the city, they will be deported. At the same time, attention is also being paid to the work of protecting Japanese nationals to prevent traitors from finding an excuse. As for national defense arrangements, the Fourth Route Army and the Eighteenth Army are separately responsible. Yu Hanmou, in order to take care of the defense of southwest Fujian, took the "Guangdong" plane to Xiamen at 9:00 AM on the 13th and then went to Zhangzhou to inspect the troops stationed there. Those who traveled with him included Li Zhenqiu, commander of the Fifth Military Region, Li Xu Huan, director of political training, and Chen Mianwu, chief of staff, and several others. They arrived in Zhangzhou at 11:00 AM that same day and returned to Guangdong by plane the following day. (July 15th)</p>
<h3>Opium King Ye Qinghe Escorted to Hankou for Trial</h3>
<p>Ye Went to Taiwan Last Year Using a False Name; a Certain Consul Repeatedly Requested Ye's Release Without Success</p>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: Ye Qinghe, a famous international opium king and current general manager of the Yumin Company, which is responsible for selling special goods throughout Fujian Province, was arrested on June 12th along with Cheng Yunxiao, director of the Fujian Provincial Anti-Opium Supervision Office. Subsequently, the Anti-Opium Supervisory Office dispatched a military law deputy director to Fujian. According to a Fuzhou telegram, Ye, Chen, and 13 others were escorted to Hankou on the 15th, where they will be tried by the Anti-Opium Supervisory Office. Ye's crimes include not only drug trafficking, smuggling raw opium, and colluding with anti-opium personnel to commit fraud, but also acts of treason and conspiracy to endanger the country. Therefore, the circumstances are extremely serious. It has been found that Ye spent a large sum of money last year to obtain Taiwanese citizenship under the name Ye Zhensheng, but he did not follow the legal procedures and was actually impersonating. The reason is that there is a Ye Zhensheng living at No. 8, 5-chome, Qihou Town, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, who has lived there for generations, is a businessman, and has some assets. He died the year before last. Qinghe went to Taiwan last August with money and bought some of Ye Zhensheng's property at a high price, thus "substituting the living for the dead" and posing as Ye Zhensheng, pretending to be a citizen. Last October, when a certain country held a "National Defense Fundraising Event," Ye donated 10,000 yuan as the first donation. Ye has committed crimes and offenses in the country for more than ten years and has obtained a lot of ill-gotten gains, but he has never donated a penny to the country or local areas. Now, he spends 10,000 yuan, which shows the great effect of this donation. Therefore, he became even bolder and did whatever he wanted. Ye's impersonation is for use when necessary. Usually, when socializing, exchanging business cards, occasionally publishing announcements, and sending invitations to guests, he still uses the name Ye Qinghe. His residence in Heshan is also called "Qinghe Villa." After obtaining Taiwanese citizenship, he did not join the Xiamen Taiwanese Resident Association. It was not until July 2nd, when Ye was arrested, that his relatives and friends used the name Ye Zhensheng to join the association on his behalf. However, Ye's arrest was carried out by the Provincial Government on the order of the Provincial Security Office. A certain consul stationed in the province repeatedly requested the Provincial Chairman Chen Yi to release or extradite Ye Zhensheng. Chen replied that he had not arrested that person. It was not until recently, when the case was transferred to the Anti-Opium Supervisory Office, that the consul's request was rejected because Ye is a famous international opium dealer. The Geneva League of Nations Anti-Opium Committee has his name on file. He cannot erase his evil deeds simply by using another name. Moreover, the deceased Ye Zhensheng was 44 years old when he died, and would be 46 years old if he were still alive. Qinghe is only 42 years old now. Not only do they look different, but their ages are also different. The world has seen the facts; how can one call a deer a horse? Therefore, even Japanese newspapers do not falsely recognize him as Ye Zhensheng. (July 14th)</p>
<h3>Baoshan</h3>
<p>Request to Exempt House Tax Receives Support</p>
<p>The county's public organizations had previously jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Provincial Government, requesting an exemption from house tax to alleviate the people's hardships, as the county government planned to levy it. It is now known that the party branches of all districts in the county also submitted a request to the county party headquarters on the 17th, arguing strongly for an exemption and stating three reasons: ㊀ Since the January 28th Incident, the people, still recovering from the disaster and famine, cannot bear additional burdens; ㊁ Baoshan County is barren and its people are poor, making it impossible to handle the tax; ㊂ Various miscellaneous taxes can be affected; it is impossible to bear a large increase.</p>
<p>Planning to Build a Seaside Park</p>
<p>The county's plan to build a seaside park existed under the previous County Magistrate Long Tiyao, but it required a large amount of funding, which was difficult to raise at the time, so it was shelved. The current County Magistrate Zhang Mingjing believes that many people, especially during the summer, come to the seawall for recreation, and the county lacks public recreation areas. Therefore, building a seaside park is essential. It is now known that a suitable site has been found outside the East Gate, with estimated expenses of more than 5,000 yuan. Efforts are being made to raise funds to start construction as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Competing for National Assembly Representatives</p>
<p>The primary election for National Assembly representatives in this county is scheduled for the 12th. All polling station administrators have been appointed by the county government. Zhu Qingzeng has already withdrawn from the regional representative election, leaving only Wu Wentian. However, news came from the province yesterday that candidates with the second-highest number of votes can also participate in the election. Therefore, Chen Zhijun, who received the second-highest number of votes in this county, began campaigning on the 18th. The county chamber of commerce convened a general meeting of representatives from various industries on the afternoon of the 18th to discuss methods and support Cheng Ganxiang in the election for occupational representatives.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Width of Main Roads Determined</p>
<p>After the completion of the north-south main road in this county, the east-west main road will continue to be widened. However, regarding the width of the road surface, the official position is 10 meters, while the people hope to reduce losses and request 8 meters. Construction meetings have been held repeatedly, but this issue could not be resolved. Before a decision was made, residents along the route voluntarily demolished their houses according to 8 meters. In order to ensure uniformity and tidiness in the future, the section chief requested instructions from the province, and the Construction Department designated a uniform width of 10 meters. Therefore, the county government has issued a public notice stating that all those who have already started construction but have not completed it, and those who have not started construction, should follow the department's order to demolish and make way.</p>
<p>Anti-Drug Unit Raids Drug Trafficking Operation in Heshi</p>
<p>The police department has received repeated confidential reports that there are private drug and opium trafficking operations in Heshi, but they could not be raided. A few days ago, the department sent police officers disguised as machinists and painters to the countryside and gathered in the town on the night of the 17th. They then went to the home of the private trafficker Ji Wu and found the private opium smoker Xu Qibing and opium smoking paraphernalia. They then went to the home of Han Bulou and found a large amount of raw opium in a broken barrel in the firewood shed, along with five suspects. They were all escorted back to the headquarters that night and handed over to the county for handling.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Donations to Comfort Soldiers</p>
<p>The actors from the various platoons of the trainee battalion of the Second District Security Chief Training Institute of Jiangsu Province, considering that the garrisons in Lugouqiao and Wanping are extremely loyal and brave in fighting for national and ethnic resistance, initiated a donation to comfort them. As of the 18th, they had donated 316.29 national currency, which was deposited in the general affairs office of the institute and transferred to the front lines through the Second District Commissioner's Office. In addition, the employees of the Xizha Station of the Jinghu Railway also issued a declaration hoping that railway stations across the country would quickly establish support associations to engage in donation and national salvation work and prevent traitorous activities.</p>
<p>Factories Facing Coal Shortage Panic</p>
<p>This county is home to many silk yarn and flour factories, which consume a large amount of coal, averaging around 700 tons per month. Recently, shipping costs have skyrocketed, and coal prices have also increased compared to before. Sources are scarce, and the situation is further affected by the tense current situation. Coal merchants have little stock, and the factories have at most enough stock to last for half a month, causing great panic. Shi Kuiling, the commissioner of the Second District, therefore sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, suggesting that they find ways to remedy the situation as soon as possible to prepare for a rainy day. After receiving the letter, the chamber of commerce has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today (the 19th) to invite representatives from coal merchants and factories to discuss remedial measures.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Drug Addict Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>The Wujin County Police Department previously received a report that Xie Yinda, who resides in Hualong Lane, and his brother Xie Hemei, also known as Xue Chanlin, were addicted to drugs and suspected of selling drugs. The department sent service member Huang Yuncheng to lead police officers to arrest Xue Chanlin and Xie Yinda one after another and seized opium pipes and drug powder. After interrogation, Xue Chanlin confessed that he had purchased and smoked drugs three times in March to treat his illness. Xie Yinda, on the other hand, did not smoke or sell drugs. It is now known that the case was decided yesterday: Xue Chanlin (aka Xie Hemei) was sentenced to death for drug addiction, while Xie Yinda was acquitted.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Retaining the Chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>Gu Suming, the chairman of the county chamber of commerce, previously resigned because the executive committee member Zou Yixiang and the clerical secretary Cheng Ruiliang were secretly reported to be suspected of opium smoking. The commissioner's office sent personnel to detain the two and send them to the health center for testing. Therefore, when convening a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, he submitted his resignation. It is now known that the shoe, pawn, and silk fabric trade associations, considering that chamber of commerce affairs are currently being promoted, earnestly hope that he will not have thoughts of resigning, but shoulder his responsibilities and fulfill his obligations to commerce, which is to create happiness for the local area. Yesterday, they sent a letter to Gu, requesting that he continue to perform his duties to satisfy their expectations and prioritize chamber of commerce affairs.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Invention of Spring Abacus</p>
<p>Song Debing, a young man from Fenghua, has recently invented a new type of Ell-style spring abacus, which is completely different from the products of the Commercial Press and China Bookstore. Its structure uses square wood as vertical rods, and the springs are made of Ell-style copper sheets, installed inside the rods. When used, the movement is flexible, and the style is beautiful and durable. Song has now applied for a patent for this abacus.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Full Line of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Opens to Traffic</p>
<p>Since the South Ping section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway began construction last year, progress has been rapid. However, progress was slightly affected last month due to flooding caused by torrential rains, which damaged the embankment of the Gan River and caused water to enter the road surface. Recently, Lin Zhenyuan, the director of the railway bureau, personally went to supervise the construction and complete the track laying. The bridges along the route are mostly completed, with only the Gan River Bridge needing to be completed by the end of the month. It is now known that the railway's construction train can now directly reach Pingxiang, but it still needs to use a ferry to cross the Gan River. The entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is now fully open to traffic.</p>
<h3>A Perspective on the Spanish Civil War (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— (French Dispatch)</p>
<p>㊂ The Spanish Civil War as a Prototype of International Warfare</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to consider the current Spanish Civil War as a small-scale international war. We know that the rebel's armaments are supplied by Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>The government army's armaments are purchased from Britain, France, Soviet Russia, and other countries. The rebel army, in addition to a small portion composed of Spanish Fascists and Royalists, consists of Moroccan soldiers, and mostly regular German and Italian troops. (According to various estimates, there are at least 150,000 Italian troops and about 60,000 German troops. Currently, Franco has no real power, and military matters are entirely controlled by German officers and General Faupel, the ambassador stationed in Salamanca). On the government army's side, there are members of the parties participating in the People's Front government, the laboring class, and international volunteers who have come from all over the world to fight for the protection of freedom, justice, and democracy. Under such circumstances, isn't the Spanish civil war a prototype of international warfare? The general staffs of the major powers are taking this opportunity to test the effectiveness of their latest tanks, aircraft, and firearms in real-world conditions. The results of these ten months of combat have proven that defensive capabilities are very strong in military terms in 1937, and offense is more difficult than defense. The battle for Madrid shows that even if the Western government's defending troops are not completely prepared, as long as they have the determination to fight to the death, the enemy will not be able to advance. This comforting conclusion was recently published by Germany's Gazette de Francfort. London's Economist recently conducted a more detailed study on this topic, stating: Germany's general staff's plan for the Spanish war, just like in 1914, assumed that it would be easy to achieve final victory quickly by using mechanized troops and tank formations to show off their power and launching a full-scale attack. However, the results obtained from the Spanish civil war proved that Germany's military strategy was incorrect. We all know that the government's defense organization was hurriedly prepared, but it was still able to resist modern weapons. In this way, it can also be said to be a victory for the Maginot Line policy! Recently, after the Western government forces reorganized their troops and unified their command, their combat power has greatly increased, and their military experience is also increasing. All defense projects imitate the Maginot Line and are underground, communicating with each other. Since the victory in the war last month, all the places occupied have been organized step by step in this way. The emphasis is not on speed, but on rigor and solidity. The destruction of tanks is not as difficult as previously imagined. In this Western war, the German army's use of tanks in combat has been greatly disappointed. Aircraft have also proven that their counter-offensive power is more terrifying than their offensive power. Some of Germany's new firearms are sometimes not as effective as those used by the enemy. As for the use of poison gas, it has not affected morale. The most obvious effect is high-altitude artillery. Therefore, the lessons of the Western war over the past ten months have caused Germany to experience two disappointments: failures in both military strategy and military technology. As a result, Germany has recently seemed to lean toward reconciliation on the surface regarding the non-intervention policy and maintaining European peace.</p>
<p>㊃ The Spanish War Proves Which Country's Armaments are Superior</p>
<p>Speaking of the various new weapons used by the major powers in the Spanish Civil War, what are their achievements from a technical point of view? Because all countries strictly maintain secrecy, it is extremely difficult for outsiders to explore the details. However, in fact, Germany's military strategy of using tanks in combat is extremely inaccurate. The German side's boasted armored division (two tank formations, a total of 500 vehicles, each with machine guns and a density of thousands of guns. The speed of movement is 50 kilometers per hour. With such destructive power, it is difficult to resist even copper walls and iron walls. It is anticipated that the enemy's defense line will be broken through by this iron army. Unexpectedly, the speed was too fast, the armor protection was weak, and because the movement was too fast, the infantry behind could not keep up. The enemy was equipped with anti-tank guns, as well as hand-held machine guns and rifles. Used properly, the army waited quietly, and this type of armored army eventually suffered destruction. French-style tanks are slower, but the armor protection is strong. At present, it seems that they can be called the most terrifying weapons on the battlefield. Therefore, it is proved that the amount of German armor seems to have failed in a small-scale experiment in the Western War before it was formally deployed to the battlefield to exert its power. Germany's anti-tank guns (caliber 3.5 mm) also achieved glory by attacking Soviet Russian tanks. Although Soviet Russian tanks have heavier armor, they are not enough to resist German anti-tank guns and are at risk of catching fire. Germany's new high-altitude artillery is the most effective weapon in this war. This type of German new high-altitude artillery is used by the German army and guarded by the German army. Even Franco's officers are not allowed to watch it closely. The used shells are counted and returned to Germany. The German Air Defense Force (D.C.A) took this opportunity to practice with its personnel and replace new troops to practice. As for the Italian motorized army, it tasted a lot of bitterness in the Battle of Guadalajara. When the Italian army launched a general offensive against the Guadalajara government army, it dispatched a large number of motorized Italian troops (about 1,200 vehicles) to take charge of the front-line offensive. Unexpectedly, the motorized Italian troops advanced quickly, and when they were 50 kilometers away from the rear troops, the headquarters' connection was cut off. Before encountering most of the government army, when they stopped on the fire road to rest, they were bombed by 20 government air force aircraft. The scene was extremely terrifying. The high-altitude artillery they carried could not be used in time because the tarpaulin of the car was not lowered. As a result, 1,000 vehicles were destroyed, and the government army also arrived, capturing 1,500 people. The result of this disastrous defeat of the Italian army actually gave the general staffs of various countries more experience and more consideration. In terms of air combat, in the European War of 1914, the number of aircraft shot down by high-altitude artillery and fighter jets was in the ratio of 1 to 5. However, the results of air combat currently obtained in the Western War are the exact opposite: 5 aircraft were shot down by high-altitude artillery and 1 aircraft was shot down by fighter jets, proving that high-altitude artillery is more effective at shooting down aircraft than fighter jets. The aviation materials of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union have not shown significant advantages or disadvantages. As for the so-called latest scientific warfare widely rumored in the world, such as deadly poison gas, death rays, germ bombs, and other terrifying destructive methods, they are just ideal military talks and may appear one day.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Basketball Team Loses to the Philippines Again</h3>
<p>Score tied 37-37 at the end of regulation time. Defeated 41-48 in overtime. The two teams will compete again tonight at 8:00 PM at the Shen Garden.</p>
<p>The Philippine McCock basketball team, returning to Shanghai from Beijing, played against the Chinese team again at the Shen Garden last night. Previously, the Chinese team had suffered three consecutive defeats in outdoor hard court matches at the city's sports ground. Last night, under indoor lighting, the Philippine team won again with a score of 48-41. The game, lasting forty minutes, was filled with ups and downs and many changes. Until the end of regulation time, the score was tied at 37-37. In overtime, the Chinese team ultimately lost 41-48. Tonight at 8:00 PM, the two teams will compete once more at the Shen Garden in a farewell match.</p>
<p>Catching Up Head-On</p>
<p>Although there were many changes in the game, there were few truly exciting moments. The Philippine team's teamwork was smoother, and their talent was more evenly distributed. Both sides committed numerous fouls, making it impossible to count them all. A total of four players were ejected, which was a drawback. The Chinese team's lack of strong center players was a major cause of their defeat. Chen Xuechong was not ideal, and Sun Huipei's selection was questionable. As a result, when Chen left the court, the team's formation immediately faltered. This was the most obvious fact last night. After the start of the game, both sides fought fiercely for a long time before Chen Xuechong finally opened the scoring. Unexpectedly, the Philippine team took the upper hand and scored eight consecutive points. Fortunately, Chen, Qian, and Feng caught up head-on, each scoring a basket, resulting in an 8-8 tie in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Leading by One Point</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second quarter, the Philippine team replaced their entire lineup. Although both sides had opportunities to shoot, they were very rusty, and few shots hit the mark. There were many instances of the ball failing to go through the hoop. Leans. Sikest, made consecutive free throws, giving the Philippine team a 12-10 lead. However, Feng Nianhua and Wang Nanzhen's subsequent contributions allowed the Chinese team to lead by one point, 13-12, at the end of the first half.</p>
<p>Philippine Team Surpasses</p>
<p>After the break, the Chinese team suddenly rallied, leading 19-14 and 20-16, twice achieving optimal advantage. It is a pity that their stamina was slightly lacking. The third quarter ended with a decline after a strong start, resulting in a score of 21-26, trailing by five points. After the start of the third quarter, Nianhua and Liangxiong both made wonderful shots, greatly increasing their momentum. However, at this crucial juncture, Chen Xuechong was ejected for his fourth foul, and Sun Huipei substituted. The performance of the "Big Cat" failed to satisfy the crowd. Nevertheless, the Chinese team continued to score, until 20-16, when the Philippine team caught up from behind. The two forwards, Balec and Huarrel, constantly broke through the defense and scored. As a result, they led by five points at the end of the third quarter, 26-21.</p>
<p>Undecided Victory</p>
<p>In the last ten minutes, there were many more twists and turns. When the score was 29-24, Yan Lianjin was ejected for his fourth foul. However, in a turn of events, the Filipino, Sulais, was also penalized. Karelo was extremely brave and unparalleled, and the score gap between China and the Philippines widened, 27-34, with China trailing by seven points. Nianhua and Jingyong each added two points, improving the situation. However, Leans also scored. Cai Wenhuan made a wonderful long-range shot, shooting through the air, bringing the score to 33-35, a difference of only two points. The situation became very tense. Unexpectedly, Cai Wenhuan was penalized another point. In these final two minutes, Zhang Liangxiong actually scored in one fell swoop, finding a way out of despair. Just as everyone cheered, Balec scored again, adding two more points for the Philippine team. Fortunately, Feng Nianhua made a final lunge, ending regulation time with a score of 37-37.</p>
<p>Overtime</p>
<p>In the five-minute overtime, the Chinese team's chances of winning seemed slim, as their physical strength was inferior, making it difficult to win. As expected, Leans and Karelo paired up, scoring consecutive baskets. At the end of their strength, the situation was set. Wang Nanzhen and Feng Nianhua overcame all difficulties and grabbed four points, but it was of no practical help. The final result was 41-48, a difference of seven points.</p>

<h3>1937 Wimbledon Tennis Championships (6)</h3>
<p>— Lie Shan, Our Correspondent in Europe</p>
<p>Day Three</p>
<p>The tension at Wimbledon on the third day was even greater than the previous two days. The crowds were already the norm at Wimbledon. There were a total of thirty-two men's singles matches today. After this elimination, the last thirty-two people will be left. My country's Xu Chengji met England's Wilde today. Wilde's status in England is third or fourth. He struggled hard for five sets yesterday before defeating France's second-ranked player, Petra. Many people were worried about Xu Chengji, fearing that he would fail. However, British sports reporters were unwilling to make predictions first because they knew Xu Chengji's strength. Wilde's recent breakthrough in tennis skills is a fact, but the reporter did not personally believe that he could defeat Xu Chengji. The result of the fierce battle was as expected. Xu Chengji won. At first, it was thought that Xu would beat Wilde in four sets. After a fierce battle of five sets, due to physical reasons, it was feared that Xu might lose. In the past, Xu Chengji was always unlucky after a fierce battle of five sets. This was the first time that he was able to win even after five sets, which proves that Xu's physical strength has improved recently, which is worthy of our joy. Cai's opponent, England's Haxia, is a second- or third-rate player. In theory, Cai had a chance to win. Unfortunately, after five sets, Cai finally failed. Therefore, in the final thirty-two people, my country has only Xu Chengji alone. After yesterday's competition, there were still fifty-five women's singles players left. There were a total of twenty-four matches today, and the elimination will leave the last thirty-one people. Men's doubles also had a makeup match today. In addition, there were also eight mixed doubles matches. My country only participated in this competition with He Renxuan - people, and unfortunately he was also eliminated as soon as he appeared.</p>
<p>▲ Kramm's Masterpiece</p>
<p>Today's men's singles, seven "main players", and Crawford, who defeated a "main player", all safely passed this stage. Borchi's opponent was Hughes, one of the famous British doubles players. Hughes's singles this year also has the hope of representing Britain at the Davis Cup. However, judging from this result, Britain's hope of retaining the Davis Cup this year is mostly bad luck. Borchi won in straight sets, with a score of six to two, six to two, six to two. On the same day, Hughes's doubles partner, Tuo Gai, (he also has the hope of representing Britain in the Davis Cup singles) also lost to Kramm in straight sets. Kramm played too wonderfully today. His cannonball serves, forehand and backhand smashes, and the appropriateness of his position when going to the net, made it almost impossible to "nitpick." His victory over Tuo Gai was very easy, with a score of six to two, six to zero, six to four. After the game today, Tilden said that Kramm had the possibility of defeating Borchi to win this year's world championship. In general, people also have this feeling. Kramm's battle today was completely the demeanor of a world-class master. His tennis skills seem to have improved a lot compared to last year.</p>
<p>The other "main players" Austin defeated Saping (USA) in straight sets, with a score of six to two, six to three, six to zero. Parker also had three sets, with a score of six to zero, six to three, six to one. Grant had four sets, with a score of six to two, three to six, six to three, six to zero. McGrathsui had four sets, with a score of six to three, six to three, five to seven, six to two. Henkel was the most dangerous, winning only after five sets, with a score of two to six, seven to five, three to six, six to zero, six to three. His opponent was an unknown British tennis player, who almost created an "upset." As for Crawford, he also won in straight sets.</p>
<p>▲ Li Shana Runs into a Nail</p>
<p>All six of the "main players" who played in the women's singles today safely passed, except for Ms. Li Shana, the other five all won in straight sets. Ms. Li Shana had a scare today. Her opponent was Ms. Linpu of England, a woman who has not attracted much attention in the past, but is actually a first-class female tennis player. In the first set, Ms. Linpu won with a score of six to one in ten minutes. Her serve almost had the weight of Ms. Mapuel, and the accuracy and speed of her forehand and backhand smashes were enough to make Ms. Li Shana helpless. The audience in the stadium was worried about Ms. Li, thinking that another "upset" had occurred today. But Ms. Li is indeed a "veteran of the sand", with no anxious attitude at all. She played the ball as calmly as ever. Ms. Linpu is ultimately an inexperienced player. She was too eager to win, and smashed every ball, often making impossible net plays. As a result, there were too many self-inflicted balls, and her attitude became more unnatural. So she lost two consecutive sets, with a score of six to one, six to two. Ms. Li Shana won. In fact, in terms of tennis skills, Ms. Linpu's strength is not only above Ms. Li Shana's group, but even it can be said that all the female players in Wimbledon are probably not her opponents. Her only problem is her impatience. Ms. Li Shana only adopted a defensive posture that day, so she achieved the final victory.</p>
<p>▲ Xu Chengji Defeats Wilde</p>
<p>Today's battle between Xu Chengji and Wilde added a lot of glory to China. Both of their serves were cannonballs, and they had considerable strength in forehand and backhand smashes and going to the net. Xu's victory was not only because his tennis skills were slightly better than Wilde's, but also because Xu had the patience to fight, and his attitude was not flustered at all. Again, Xu knew his own weaknesses and did not often go to the net (although Xu's net skills were first-class), so he saved a lot of energy, so he had the possibility of fighting hard for five sets.</p>
<p>After the first set started, Wilde won two games first, and then Xu also won back two games, with a score of two to two. After reaching three to three, Xu won two consecutive games. Although Wilde won another game, when it was Xu's turn to serve for the last time, he won the first set with a score of six to four.</p>
<p>The competition in the second set was even fiercer. It was almost whoever served, who won. Until after the score of four to four, Xu carelessly lost two consecutive games, losing this set, with a score of four to six, Wilde won.</p>
<p>The third set was Xu's world. Wilde repeatedly went to the net, but was broken by Xu's high ball. Xu performed very wonderfully in this set, and the audience applauded thunderously. Wilde only won two games in a one-sided situation, with a score of six to two, Xu won.</p>
<p>In the fourth set, everyone showed fatigue. The situation was exactly the opposite of the second set, that is, whoever served, lost. However, everyone tried their best to deal with it, so the battle situation was also extremely tense. Wilde once led with a score of four to two, and then Xu won back - game, this number is four to three. In the eighteenth game, Wilde smashed a ball, which had already gone out of bounds. If Xu had gotten this point, the score would have become four to four. Unfortunately, the referee failed to see it and instead counted this point on Wilde's account. At that time, Xu seemed to be stimulated and hit two wild balls in a row. As a result, it became a situation of five to three. In the ninth game, Xu's mood did not seem to have recovered, and he finally failed with a score of six to three. After Wilde won the electric one set, the result was that each won two sets.</p>
<p>The fifth set was the last set. Everyone was a little worried about Xu Chengji beforehand, because Wimbledon is different from the Davis Cup competition. There is no rest time in the middle of the five-set match, and the two had been fighting hard for two hours at this time. How was Xu's physical strength? It is naturally an important issue. After the start of this set, Xu won a game first, and Wilde also returned a game, with a score of one to one. At this point, not only had Xu's attitude returned to its original state, but on the contrary, Wilde became impatient after being calculated by Xu's few wonderful balls. His angry attitude caused the audience to laugh. Xu took the opportunity to win three consecutive games, with a score of four to one. Wilde once again made a final struggle and also won Er game in a row, with a score of four to three. At this point, Xu Chengji also hit a ball out of bounds, the situation was exactly the same as Wilde's ball in the fourth set. The referee did not see it either, and Wilde added this point, he had become the "end of his strength." In the last two games, Xu played even more smoothly, completely in the posture of a world-class master, and received the final victory in the applause of the entire audience.</p>
<p>Xu Chengji's victory today is worthy of our attention, not only because he reached the stage of the last thirty-two people, but more importantly, this is the first time that he has been able to defeat a strong opponent after fighting hard for five sets. He proved that "Chinese people's physical strength is not as good as Europeans, so sports competitions will fail." This popular saying among Chinese sports circles should not be used as a definition. As long as you continue to work hard, as long as you have a strong will, Europeans' bodies are not made of iron either.</p>
<p>▲ Doubles Have an Upset</p>
<p>In today's men's doubles, there was also an "upset." Crawford and McGrathsui, the famous Australian doubles team, one of the "main players" at Wimbledon this year, were defeated in straight sets by the Czech doubles team, Mengser and Hequite, and the score was still in straight sets, six to three, six to three, six to two. Mengser suffered a defeat to Crawford in the first singles match on the left, and today he finally got a little revenge.</p>

<h3>Overview of Shanghai Municipal Primary Schools (3)</h3>
<p>㊂ Administrative Organization</p>
<p>The principals of municipal primary schools are appointed by the Bureau of Social Affairs and are responsible for handling all school affairs. The administrative organization of each school is divided into four departments in the vertical direction: Academic Affairs, Moral Education, General Affairs, and Research. Each department has a department director who handles the affairs of the respective department. In the horizontal direction, it is divided into four groups: senior, intermediate, junior, and kindergarten. Each group has a group director who handles the teaching affairs of the respective group. If the school is small, the situation can be considered to merge several departments or reduce a certain group in order to simplify the administrative organization. As for the handling of special problems, there are special committees responsible for carrying out the work, such as the Economic Audit Committee, the Civic Training Committee, the Health Education Committee, the Enrollment Committee, the Graduate Guidance Committee, the Publishing Committee, the Catering Committee, and other various committees. The establishment of special committees in each school depends on the size of the school and the actual needs of the school.</p>
<p>There are also various meetings in each school to discuss school affairs and study teaching methods. The school affairs meeting of each school is a general meeting attended by all teachers, convened by the principal, to review major school matters, formulate or revise various important regulations, and pass important proposals submitted by each department and section. Larger schools have a school affairs committee during the recess of the school affairs meeting to implement the resolutions of the school affairs meeting and handle temporary school affairs. The departmental affairs meeting is attended by the teachers and staff of each department, convened by the department director, to discuss the progress of the department. The group affairs meeting is attended by the teachers and staff of each group, convened by the group director, to discuss the teaching affairs of the group. The special committee is convened by the chairman of the committee, with relevant members participating, to discuss various issues related to the committee.</p>
<p>In terms of establishment, municipal primary schools are roughly divided into four types: single-class, multi-class, single-grade, and two-part. Larger schools also set up short-term primary school classes to assist in the promotion of compulsory education. The number of students in each class varies according to the grade level: kindergartens have 30 to 50 students per class, grades one and two have 50 to 80 students per class, grades three and four have 60 to 70 students per class, and grades five and six have 50 to 60 students per class. According to the Shanghai Education Statistics for the second semester of the 19th year, the total number of primary school students that all the classrooms of municipal primary schools in all districts of the city can accommodate is 31,498, while the total number of primary school students actually accommodated in all the classrooms of each school is 31,539, exceeding the total number that can be accommodated by 41 people. The age distribution of students is listed according to the same statistics: the median age of kindergarten students is 7.2 years old, the median age of first-grade students is 9.6 years old, the median age of second-grade students is 10.1 years old, the median age of third-grade students is 11.3 years old, the median age of fourth-grade students is 12.4 years old, the median age of fifth-grade students is 13.5 years old, and the median age of sixth-grade students is 14.3 years old.

The Wenmiao Park in the first district party headquarters in the southern city, the Bao'an Corps headquarters in Zhabei, the third district party headquarters in the first special district, the Zhengshi Middle School on Zhizhong Road in the second special district, the Ningbo Fellow Association in the commercial sector, the Central Assembly Hall, the Trade Unions in the industrial sector, Fenglin Bridge, etc. were the most crowded, impenetrable. Even the nearby roads were blocked. In the southern city and Zhabei, police, Bao'an Corps, civic training teams, and boy scout killing teams lined up to vote, often in groups of three to five hundred people. Verification and ticketing took quite some time. At several places, tables and chairs were overturned by the voters, which shows one aspect of its grand occasion. Other rural areas were not visited due to the long distance. In general, the situation throughout the day was that the Civic Federation and Taxpayers' Association in each famous district had publicized and guided the people, so not only was voting exceptionally enthusiastic, but also the people elected were quite concentrated. Although the exact number must be determined after the ballot counting today, the general trend is that Du Yuesheng, Qian Xinzhi, Mi Xingbai, Tao Baichuan, Jiang Huaishu, and Su Liping are most likely to be elected in the regional elections, Ju Qiaxiang, Wang Xiaolai, and Guo Shun in the commercial sector, and Sheng Jingshi and Zhu Xuefan in the industrial sector are more likely to be elected.</p>

<h3>China Literary and Art Association Issues Important Declaration on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>In response to the increasingly serious situation after the Lugouqiao Incident, the China Literary and Art Association issued an important declaration yesterday, expressing its solemn position on the current situation. More than one hundred people, including Chuan Donghua, Hong Shen, and Xu Xingzhi, signed the declaration.</p>
<h3>The Brewing of Anglo-American Mediation Is Gradually Becoming a Reality</h3>
<p>The British Ambassador Hurriedly Goes South to Inquire About Our Attitude, the Japanese Are Proactive, So the Focus of Mediation Is in Tokyo</p>
<p>Although peace negotiations on the northern war have continued, Japan's troop increases have not stopped, and we are unwilling to accept humiliation no matter what. With the two sides arguing, a major war could break out at any time. Now, our government has ordered our ambassadors stationed abroad to inform the countries that signed the Nine-Power Treaty, as well as the Soviet Union and Germany, to announce that Japan has violated the treaty and infringed on our sovereignty, and to announce the attitude we are currently taking. According to a reporter from the New Voice News Agency, who learned from foreign diplomatic circles, Anglo-American mediation has gradually become a reality from brewing. France, as the leader of the League of Nations, has its own interests in the Far East that cannot be ignored, and will also be one of the main mediators. In addition, Italy will also come forward to mediate. Now, regarding Britain's attitude, it is not as hesitant as it was during the September 18th Incident. Since Sir Leith-Ross's visit to China, Britain's relationship with China has become closer and closer. Britain's commercial interests in North China are greater than those of the United States and France, so it has its own importance and cannot allow Japan to trample on it. Therefore, Britain will inevitably be the first to mediate. The British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's, hurried trip south was to inquire about the attitude of our government. As for the United States Ambassador Johnson, he is still in Peiping. The French Ambassador, Naggiar, and the Italian Ambassador, Cova, are both temporarily staying in Beidaihe and are not yet preparing to go south, so as to observe the development of the situation in the north. It is also heard that the countries believe that the northern war was initiated by Japan, while China is in a passive position, so the focus of mediation is in Tokyo, and the ambassadors of the respective countries stationed in Japan will mediate with the Japanese government.</p>

<h3>Leaders of Industry and Commerce Voluntarily Organize Special Training Class</h3>
<p>Leading by Example to Set an Example for Society, the First Class of 200 People Started Training Yesterday</p>
<p>The special training class of the training corps of the Civic Training Office in this city officially started training yesterday. The team members are all leaders and experts from various industries and businesses in this city, who are now voluntarily receiving training, which is sufficient to set a trend for society. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Process of Organizing</p>
<p>After the Civic Training Office actively promoted civic training in this city, volunteers from all walks of life were very enthusiastic, and the results were unexpectedly good. In previous training sessions, employees of various factories and companies competed to join, and the situation was particularly enthusiastic. It is now heard that the heads of various public groups, assistant managers and factory directors of various factories and companies, and various experts believe that civic training is a basic work for saving the country. Since employees have already joined, they themselves bear the responsibility of leadership and should lead by example to set an example for society. Therefore, after several collective discussions, they voluntarily initiated a proposal to participate in training. After reporting to the Civic Training Office of this city, Director Li Xiangqi and General Team Leader Tao Yishan believed that the enthusiasm of leaders from all walks of life to receive training was extremely admirable. However, since each person has his own business and is extremely valuable to society and the country, and their knowledge is also very rich, and they are all over 30 years old, most of them are around 40 years old, the ordinary training methods and courses are not applicable. It was decided to hold a special training class to improve the academic level, and to organize a team affairs committee to hire Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qian Xinzhi, Chu Qiaqing as honorary members, Li Xiangqi, Tao Yishan, Huang Renzhi as incumbent members, and Zeng Qingji, Li Zixiang, Cai Renbao (also as secretary), Wang Zhenfang (also as accountant), Hu Xiyuan, Pan Yangyao, Shi Jiying, Shen Jiucheng, Gao Shiheng, Xiang Kangyuan, Fang Yixian, Wang Xingyao, etc. as team affairs members to assist in everything. After the news was released, more than 380 people signed up, exceeding the quota, even doubling it. After the Civic Training Office approved it, the first batch of trainees was set at 200 people, and the rest will be included in the second batch, which will be scheduled separately.</p>
<p>Started Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of training for the special training team. Before 5:00 AM, the students had arrived at the training ground one after another, including Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Shen Jiucheng, Hu Xiyuan, Xiang Kangyuan, Shi Jiying, Wang Zhenfang, Cai Renbao, Gao Shiheng, Wei Yi, Shi Jiuyun, Gu Bingyuan, Li Yushu, Jiang Jifan, Jin Runxiang, Yan E'sheng, Wang Boyuan, Lu Gaoyi, Chen Tianjun, Zeng Guangqing, Xie Chunpu, Cai Chengxin. Li Zufan, Chen Xiaodie, Lu Chengzhang, Zhang Huikang, Tong Lvqing, Sun Daosheng, Rong Liangren, Yan Qingxiang, Wang Zuocai, Cheng Shouchong, Jiang Wanping, and other 200 people. At 5:30, it officially started. After Team Leader Tao Yishan of the Civic Training Office delivered a speech, a briefing ceremony was held to introduce the team leaders as follows: Team leader concurrently held by Director Li, Deputy team leaders Wang Shaozhai, Tao Yishan, Team attachments Zeng Qingji, Li Zixiang, Li Chengqi, District team leaders Zhao Dongjiang, Wang Huanxiang, Zheng Zhong, Jian Jichun, District team attachments An Liang, Xie Ziliang, Wang Huanan, The whole team is divided into four district teams, each district team is divided into three sub-teams, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday are academic subjects, Wednesday and Friday are health subjects, and Sunday is field exercise, with a total period of three months, graduating on October 10th.</p>
<p>Spirits are High</p>
<p>The students of this team are all voluntarily participating, and some were dissuaded by others, but they are determined to participate. Therefore, their spirits are very high, and some are already over 50 years old. The Civic Training Office also feels particularly excited about this team, believing that it is the key to national revival.</p>

<h3>Outbound Ceremony for Students in Specialized Training Above College Level</h3>
<p>2,209 Students Depart for Service; Commander Wang and Others Encourage Them to Strive for the Nation</p>
<p>The outbound ceremony for students in specialized schools and above, belonging to the Municipal Student Centralized Training Corps, was held yesterday morning (the 18th) at 7:00 a.m. at the large training ground beside the Zhongzheng Camp in West Shanghai. Present were military and government officials Wen Huazhou and Zhao Zhuzhong, school representatives Wang Yukai and Ye Yaokui, and parents of the team members. Corps Commander Wang Jingjiu presided. The departing students, comprising the First and Second Brigades and the 32nd Company, numbered 2,209 in total. All wore grass-green military uniforms and carried rifles. A small team of female students wore blue dresses. They were arranged in formation in front of the platform, their spirits high. The flag-raising ceremony was conducted to the sound of military music. First, there was a review of the troops. The reviewing officer circled the field once, and then the troops marched in review, each team marching past the platform in regular formation. They then formed into columns and lined up in front of the platform. The ceremony then began. After performing the formalities, Corps Commander Wang presented certificates and commemorative medals, and gave a report, saying, "Today, the members of the specialized schools and above are departing for service. You have received training here for two months, and your physique, spirit, and thinking have all improved. I hope you, the nation's precious youth, bear the heavy responsibility of saving the country. You all have patriotic enthusiasm. I hope that after leaving the camp, you will maintain the good habits you developed here, further exert your strength, and strive for the country." Then, Zhi Huazhou gave instructions, saying briefly, "Your performance in centralized training has been excellent. I hope you can shoulder the responsibility of revitalizing China and defending the nation and its people. Your departure today is the starting point for serving the country." Wang Yukai, representative of Daxia University, said, "You have all made progress here under the guidance of the officers. After returning to school, I hope you can influence your classmates and change the academic atmosphere. On behalf of the schools, I would like to thank the officers." Student representative Qin Bin then delivered a reply, saying, "The students have made considerable progress here in the past two months, receiving the officers' earnest instructions. Our country is at a critical juncture of life and death. Without intensifying organization and concentrating our strength, we cannot save the nation from peril and ensure its survival. After leaving the camp, the students will still follow the officers' instructions and strive to support the leader in saving the nation and ensuring its survival." The ceremony concluded at 8:30 a.m.</p>
<h3>Joint Station Planned for the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railways</h3>
<p>Location Determined, Construction Scale Grand; Current Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Station to Be Converted into a Cargo Depot</p>
<p>The matter of direct train service between Shanghai and Guangzhou has been decided by the directors of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo, Zhejiang-Jiangxi, and Guangdong-Hankou Railways at a road administration conference convened at the Ministry of Railways in the capital recently. The service is scheduled to begin on November 1st of this year. The Qianjiang Bridge is expected to be completed in early October. Other projects, such as replacing the rails on the Hangzhou-Yushan section and connecting the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, are currently underway and are expected to be fully completed by the end of September. According to inquiries by a Dagongshe reporter, the authorities of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo and Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railways believe that with the future frequent connections between the two lines after the Shanghai-Guangzhou train service begins, their relationship will become even closer. Therefore, they have decided to jointly build a joint station at their intersection. Both parties have sent personnel to conduct thorough research and have determined the location at the city station. It is said that the construction scale will be extraordinarily grand, and there are plans to add equipment and lay additional parking tracks to facilitate passengers' boarding and alighting. On the other hand, the current Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Main Station at Houchaomen will be converted into a passenger and cargo handling depot to facilitate freight transport.</p>
<h3>City Government Tenth Anniversary Exhibitions Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hygiene Exhibition to Be Moved to the People's Education Center</p>
<p>The seven major exhibitions held in commemoration of the City Government's tenth anniversary – municipal administration, literature, hygiene, air defense, handicrafts, mechanized industry, and industrial safety – have achieved great success since their simultaneous opening on the 7th of this month. Citizens have flocked to the city center to visit them. Except for the air defense exhibition, which closed on the 13th, the remaining six exhibitions all closed simultaneously at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday and the last day of the exhibitions, so the city center was even more bustling. After the closing of the exhibitions, except for the literature and industrial exhibits, which have been entrusted to specialists for review and evaluation, the others are being wrapped up separately. It is reported that the organizing committee of the hygiene exhibition, to facilitate visits by the public in the southern part of the city, will soon move the exhibition to the Southern Municipal People's Education Center to continue the exhibition.</p>
<h3>Broadcast to the American Public: Dong Xianguang Speaks on Recent Sino-Japanese Issues</h3>
<p>American people are extremely concerned about the Sino-Japanese dispute in North China. The American Columbia Broadcasting System specially invited Mr. Dong Xianguang to broadcast to the American public on the recent Sino-Japanese issues from Shanghai at 6:45 a.m. yesterday (the 18th). The broadcast was relayed to various parts of the country by the Ministry of Transportation's radio station. His speech is as follows:</p>
<p>I am very grateful to the Columbia Broadcasting System for giving me this opportunity to say a few words about the Sino-Japanese crisis, which threatens world peace. Before getting to the main topic, let me briefly outline the historical background of Sino-Japanese relations since 1915.</p>
<p>In 1915, taking advantage of the fact that all countries in the world were caught up in the vortex of the Great War and had no time to look east, Japan suddenly presented China with the Twenty-One Demands. If China had accepted all of these Twenty-One Demands, it would have simply become an appendage of Japan. By 1922, thanks largely to the efforts of the United States, the Nine-Power Treaty was completed, guaranteeing the territorial integrity of China. However, this treaty was broken by Japan in 1931. It occupied my four northeastern provinces and threatened my Beijing and Tianjin. At that time, China was not strong enough to offer effective resistance, so the eastern part of Hebei Province, close to the Great Wall, was designated as a demilitarized zone. Soon after, the traitor Yin Rugeng, instigated by Japan, declared the demilitarized zone to be detached from the Hebei provincial government, and warned Nanjing that Japan would not sit idly by if it used force to coerce Yin Rugeng. Then, the northern part of another Chinese province, Chahar, was also occupied by Japan. Since 1935, Japanese politicians have repeatedly stated that they intend to completely bring the five provinces of North China under Japanese rule, saying that this is their unwavering determination.</p>
<p>This special Sino-Japanese relationship is extremely one-sided. If you want to truly understand this situation, I can give you an analogy. It is as if a group of foreign troops suddenly came to your United States and snatched away your New England states. In fact, our four northeastern provinces are larger than your New England states, with a total area of 500,000 square miles, or your New England states plus a Texas. Your two largest states, Texas and California, combined, may be about the same size.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that these foreign troops, after occupying your New England, used it as a base to conquer other parts of the United States, paying particular attention to the states along the Atlantic coast, assuming that from Virginia northward and westward through Michigan and Wisconsin to the Northwest, they seized the land in the Great Lakes region. How would you feel? The new incident created by Japan ten days ago has the goal of invading Beijing, the old capital of China, which is about eighty miles from the coast, just like Washington. Its port is Tianjin, just like New York, Philadelphia, or Baltimore is Washington's port. Before this new incident occurred, there were 7,000 Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin and 3,000 in and around Beijing. This already exceeded the number of troops stipulated in the Boxer Protocol by a great many.</p>
<p>At 10 p.m. on July 7th, a Japanese troop conducted live-fire field exercises in front of Wanping City, where Chinese troops were stationed. Wanping City is close to the Lugou Bridge. I would like to ask you to put yourselves in our shoes. Imagine if a troop of foreign soldiers stationed in Washington conducted night exercises within ten miles of your capital. I say that their intention is to create trouble. You will certainly agree, because in this situation, an incident is very easy to happen. Sure enough, the incident really happened.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese, they lost a soldier who participated in the exercise. Therefore, at 12:00 midnight, this Japanese troop demanded to enter Wanping City to search for this escaped soldier. This demand was, of course, rejected by the Chinese troops. Thereupon, the Japanese troops opened fire and bombarded the city, and at the same time destroyed our Lugou Bridge.</p>
<p>In less than two hours, Japanese reinforcements had arrived to join the attack. After repeated provocations, the Chinese troops then began to return fire. Why did the Japanese single out Wanping and Lugou Bridge as their targets of attack? Because these two places are strategically very important, being important strongholds on the Chinese defense line and controlling a railway that runs from Beijing to Hankou, directly connecting to the central part of China. Japan has long wanted to occupy this fortress to isolate Beijing. A year ago, they used this high-pressure tactic to successfully occupy Fengtai, an important point on the Beijing-Shenyang Railway. So this time they tried again.</p>
<p>The result of the aggression on July 7th and in the following days was that the Japanese ambition expanded further, and they even declared that they wanted to occupy even more territory in northern China. In order to support this aggressive plan, more than 25,000 Japanese troops were deployed to the Beijing-Tianjin area within a week. According to senior Japanese military officers, their purpose is to "punish the violent Chinese." Tokyo also claimed that Japan planned to send five more divisions to China. In other words, their troops in North China would soon number 100,000. Japan has already controlled the Beijing-Shenyang Railway and occupied strongholds along the line. Within Chinese territory, they dig trenches everywhere at will. Japanese troops not only obstruct the peaceful life and work of the Chinese people, but also obstruct the business of other non-Chinese people. When a vehicle of the American naval attaché was traveling on a Chinese highway, Japanese troops demanded to search the occupants and refused. They even threatened with bayonets. Fortunately, their officers stopped them in time, otherwise, it is not known what terrible insults would have occurred. The overbearing attitude of the Japanese leaders, compared with the calm and solemn attitude of the President of the Executive Yuan and Commander-in-Chief of the Military Affairs of China, Chiang Kai-shek, is indeed worth noting. Since the incident occurred, Mr. Chiang and his colleagues in the government have never said a provocative word. They certainly do not stir up the flames of war among the people as much as Japanese politicians and soldiers do.</p>
<p>The policy currently adopted by Japan is completely the same as the policy of occupying Manchuria in 1931. All phenomena, such as saying that China is insincere, creating incidents, threatening with strong words, and conducting night battle exercises, are simply reenacted. The tactics of using the people's national psychology to stir up the frenzy of war sentiment are also the same as in 1931.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Japan says that its arbitrary behavior in North China is a special right given to them by treaties and agreements. However, they did not hesitate to destroy the Nine-Power Treaty, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant at the same time in order to seize Shenyang and occupy Manchuria. They regard treaties and agreements as dirt, but now they are blaming China for destroying agreements signed under duress.</p>
<p>Japanese troops in Chinese territory enjoy this kind of absolute freedom to come and go and arbitrarily destroy China's defense capabilities. However, Japanese diplomats are warning the Chinese government in Nanjing that they cannot tolerate the Chinese government giving spiritual or material assistance to the Chinese self-defense forces. They cannot tolerate Chinese troops entering Chinese territory related to the incident. They also cannot allow the Nanjing government to participate in resolving this dispute. If their warnings are not heeded, they even threaten with adverse consequences.</p>
<p>What the outcome of the situation will be is not something we can predict. I am unable to describe to you, my American audience, the state of tension and anger that is sweeping across all aspects of our country. China's policy of peace, I know, need not be explained, you all understand it very well. China hopes to be on friendly terms with all its neighbors, especially Japan. However, there is a limit to tolerating aggression. Since the Japanese occupation of Manchuria in 1931, our government has always adopted a policy of appeasement. However, seeing our abundant territory being stripped away piece by piece by a strong neighbor, we can no longer continue this policy indefinitely.</p>
<p>Our government has now sent troops to the border of Hebei Province. Whether it will order these troops to continue to advance and defend Beijing and Tianjin will depend on how the situation develops. However, Japan is now actively increasing its troops in this area, showing that a large-scale military action is inevitable. If this situation unfolds, our troops will have no choice but to move north, and the result will be war. What the impact on the world will be in the future, only God knows.</p>
<p>We know that most Americans do not want to be drawn into the vortex because of our dispute. However, I want you to think about it. Now, war is not easy to localize. War is like a fire in the neighborhood. We Chinese certainly hope that our fire will not spread to the area of your property, but you must know that fire cannot be localized. What's more, this kind of fire is fueled by imperialism and national ambition.</p>
<p>We hope that those who sincerely uphold peace in the Pacific, that is, world peace, will not forget that we now have a mechanism for deliberation and action. That is the Nine-Power Treaty. This treaty has been a barrier to peace for ten years. The only one who has broken it is Japan. Although this treaty cannot prevent Japan from invading our territory, it cannot be said that it has lost its binding force on the signatory countries. If the signatory countries cannot rise up to mediate, and if the Japanese military is unwilling to take a more cooperative attitude, war will be difficult to avoid. Under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, what the entire nation is pursuing is peace with honor, and honor in peace. If Japan wants to provoke us again, then, for the sake of honor, we will not hesitate to fight them on the battlefield with honor. Finally, I would like to say that I firmly believe that when the clouds of war break out in the future, this great country on the other side of the Pacific, which is now listening to my speech and has always been on friendly terms with China, will certainly respond to us and shout "May God uphold justice!"</p>

<h3>Large Quantity of Scrap Iron Intercepted from Japanese Truck in Tanziwan</h3>
<p>Japanese Man, Fan Cangxian, Goes to Xinzha Sub-bureau to Request Release</p>
<p>Gao Hengshan, a police officer of the Municipal Police Bureau's Zhabei Xinzha Sub-bureau, saw a Japanese truck fully loaded with about 4,000 to 5,000 catties of scrap iron while on duty in the Tanziwan area the other day afternoon. He stopped the truck to inquire about the source of the scrap iron. The driver hesitated to answer and offered a bribe of two yuan and seventy cents in foreign currency, asking to be released. The police officer resolutely refused to accept. At this time, there was another escort in the car, who, seeing that the police officer was not accepting the bribe, then offered ten yuan in legal tender, asking for help. But the police officer, loyal to his duty, believed that the origin of the item was unknown and took the driver and the escort to the sub-bureau. Subsequently, a Japanese man named "Fan Cangxian" went to the Xinzha Sub-bureau and claimed that he was a procurement officer of the China Industrial Development Company and that a total of 28 tons of scrap iron had been purchased. This was the first batch of transportation, and all purchased goods were stored in the Baziqiao China Essential Oil Factory, Baoshan Glass Factory, and Shanghai Chemical Factory, etc., and would be sold in this port after being smelted into iron blocks, denying that there was any sale for export, and requested the release. The sub-bureau, according to the situation, checked the evidence and sent it to the main bureau. According to the above situation, the China Baoshan and other factories are special smelting iron organizations. It is even clearer that the Japanese in Shanghai secretly converted various factories into military factories to manufacture ammunition, as reported in recent days.</p>
<h3>Aphrodisiacs Seized from Ante Drugstore</h3>
<p>Court Approves Confiscation</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, a detective from the political department of the Public Concession Police, recently investigated and found that the "Yahuanxiang" and "Anineng" sold by Qin Anbang's Ante Drugstore at No. 6, Cianicun, Lane 526, Tianjin Road, were disguised aphrodisiacs. Therefore, he went to the store at 4 p.m. the other day afternoon to search and confiscated five boxes of "Yahuanxiang" and twenty boxes of "Anineng," and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police station lawyer Jiang Baolian requested the Special No. 1 Court to confiscate the items, which was approved by Judge Zhan.</p>
<h3>Drunken Police Officer Harasses Female Worker</h3>
<p>A Jin surname village woman from Beipaotai, Wusong Town, is nearly twenty years old and somewhat attractive. She is a female worker in a yarn factory. The other day evening, after getting off work, she went to a relative's house in Songzhen for dinner, and then hired a rickshaw to go home. When the rickshaw arrived near the Jishenghui in Zhenbei, at about 8 p.m., a drunken police officer, Zhang Xianglin, about thirty years old, from Suqian, dressed in plain clothes, stopped the rickshaw, pulled out a pistol, and ordered the rickshaw to stop. The rickshaw puller dared not disobey and stopped. The police officer, driven by lust, became emboldened and attempted to rape her. The female worker, seeing the fierce approach, was extremely anxious, and while resisting desperately, she shouted for help. Members of the Wusong Section Fire Brigade, hearing the cry, rushed to the scene. The police officer then abandoned the woman and fled. He was subsequently captured by the fire brigade members and other police officers and escorted to the Wusong Police Station. At that time, the woman's pants were torn due to her resistance, and the surface of her watch was also broken. Director Zhan inquired about the situation and, because the matter involved harassing a woman on the road, dispatched police yesterday morning to send Zhang Xianglin to the Shanghai Police Headquarters for legal punishment in order to deter wrongdoing and prevent imitation.</p>
<h3>Vienna Red Dance Star, Liu Huizhi's Former Concubine Chen Manli Sues Her Father to Return Property</h3>
<p>Court Adjourns Case Because Both Parties Fail to Appear</p>
<p>Chen Manli, a former Vienna dancer, is only nineteen years old, in the prime of her youth, and beautiful in appearance. Back in 1935, when she was dancing in Vienna and earning a lot each month, Liu Huizhi, then Chairman of the China Industrial Bank, often went to spend time with Chen. He fell in love at first sight and immediately took her as a concubine, renting a house for her at No. 48, Zhongshi New Village, Yuyuan Road, and cherishing her like gold. Chen's father, Chen Musen, and his wife also lived in Shanghai at that time, and the family's livelihood depended on Chen's support. After Chen married Liu, her father became increasingly extravagant due to his improved living conditions, often extorting money from his daughter. Chen, unable to bear his harassment, issued a written statement of disownment with her father in the summer of that year, and Chen also paid 2,500 yuan as a one-time support fee. However, not long after, Chen Manli and Liu disagreed and separated. Liu gave Chen 100,000 yuan as her future living expenses. At that time, Chen deposited half of the money in the Four Banks Savings Society, and used the rest to buy jewelry and real estate. She then re-entered the St. Anna Dance Hall to resume her old profession. She then met Zhu Ruifu, the manager of Jiufu Company, and lived with him, with Zhu paying her 270 yuan per month for living expenses. However, Chen's father learned of the news of Chen's separation from Liu and the large sum of money. He could not help but covet the money, and conspired with his wife to pretend to be close to his daughter and gradually embezzle her savings. It was not until April of this year that Chen discovered it, and a quarrel ensued. The two sides then broke up again. But Chen's father was still undeterred and, on the night of May 18, while Chen was dancing, secretly stole the keys, stamps, and deposit books from her safe. When Chen returned home and discovered it, it was too late to recover them. Therefore, she urgently commissioned a lawyer in the morning to go to the Four Banks Savings Society to report the loss, and thus was not harmed. At the same time, because her home was no longer habitable, she left. Unexpectedly, her father believed that Chen's departure was instigated by Zhu Ruifu, because he had once been involved in litigation and lost the case. Recently, Chen Manli suddenly hired a lawyer and submitted a statement to the civil court of the district court, suing her father to return the previously embezzled property. After the court received the statement, Judge Qian Guocheng held a trial in the Civil Division 5 yesterday. Because neither the plaintiff nor the defendant appeared in court, the court adjourned the case and ordered that the two parties be summoned for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Chen Jianfeng Turns Himself in for Gang Fight Over Peeping Tom</h3>
<p>Claims No Harassment or Fighting; Court Orders Remand for Joint Trial</p>
<p>Wang Yuedi, an eighteen-year-old woman from Wuxi, recently fell in love with Ji Jinming from Tongzhou and lived together at No. 340, Baoding Road. Chen Jianfeng, a local resident living at No. 506, Kunming Road, often harassed Wang Yuedi with lewd remarks. The woman, unable to bear his harassment, told Ji Jinming about the situation. Ji Jinming, unable to contain his anger, negotiated with Chen, but they disagreed and argued with each other. At 10:15 p.m. on the 12th of this month, the two sides each invited dozens of old friends, armed with iron bars and axes, to fight near Huishan Road and Kunming Road. Chen Jianfeng's side fired a handgun, but fortunately it did not hit anyone. The Chinese and foreign detectives from the Huishan Police Station, hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene and also fired shots into the air as a warning. As a result, they arrested nine men and women, including Ji Jinming, Wang Yuedi, and accomplices Wang Jiaquan, Xu Awu, Zhang Weiyu, and Chen Dicai, and sent them to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. The other day morning at 9 a.m., Chen Jianfeng hired attorney Fan Gang and turned himself in to the police station. Yesterday, he was sent to Criminal Division 3. Police lawyer Li Zhishan explained the previous situation and requested a postponement for a joint trial with Xu Awu and Ji Jinming. When questioned, Chen Jianfeng said, "Wang Yuedi must pass by my house every day when she goes out. There was no harassment or fighting. I did not participate in the fight." Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be remanded for a joint trial.</p>
<h3>Romantic Debt Lawsuit Involving Daughter Representative of Liu Xiang</h3>
<p>Cao Linsheng's Defense Insufficient; Ordered to Pay Plaintiff 13,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Chen Li Zemin, a woman from Sichuan who claims to be the female representative of Liu Xiang in Shanghai, has been in Shanghai to negotiate the development of Sichuan products. However, she owed the Mu Ansu Law Firm, which she commissioned for litigation and non-litigation matters, a total of 13,000 yuan in public fees. It was not until April 27 of this year that she obtained a check for 13,000 yuan from the Mainland Bank, dated May 30, from Cao Linsheng at the Hamil Den Building on Jiangxi Road, and delivered it to Mu's firm. Unexpectedly, it could not be cashed when it was due. Therefore, the Mu Ansu Law Firm entrusted lawyer Lu Congzu to file a complaint in the civil court of the First Special District Court against the drawer, Cao Linsheng, requesting that he be ordered to pay the amount of the check and applying for provisional execution. At that time, the defendant's defense was that Chen Li Zemin's dealings with the defendant were due to mining development matters. Later, Chen Li Zemin suddenly developed a one-sided infatuation and did not achieve her purpose, and therefore resented Cao. The check was allegedly obtained by her through deception on April 27 of this year. Therefore, the defendant had stopped payment to the bank afterward. Therefore, Cao cannot compensate for the claimed amount. The case has been repeatedly summoned and debated to a conclusion. The details have also been reported in previous reports. Yesterday was the date of the verdict. Judge Mo ascended the seat and pronounced that the defendant, Cao Linsheng, should pay the plaintiff the amount of 13,000 yuan and approved the plaintiff's application for provisional execution. The court adjourned after the pronouncement.</p>
<h3>Wang Heying Sues Wu Zhihao for Seduction and Abandonment Case Settled</h3>
<p>Wu Pays Wang and Son Living Expenses in One Lump Sum; Wang Petitions the Court to Withdraw the Private Prosecution</p>
<p>Wu Zhihao, founder and manager of the now-closed Ningbo Industrial Bank and manager of the Shanghai National Goods Company, a native of Fenghua, was recently sued in the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court by Wang Heying, a fellow villager, on behalf of herself and her son Yuan Xin, represented by lawyer Chen Xingmin, for seduction and abandonment, and also filed a civil suit, requesting a judgment ordering him to pay a huge amount of living expenses. It was claimed that she herself had received considerable education, and her former husband, Xu Shiping, was a cadre in the Party headquarters. In the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the plaintiff was seduced by Wu Zhihao and lost her virginity in a hotel. After becoming pregnant, her former husband found out, and the couple fell out of harmony. On August 5th of the same year, after agreeing to a divorce with her husband, she lived with Wu at No. 9 Ronghua Lane, Milu Road, in the French Concession. The following year, she gave birth to her son Yuan Xin, who is now four years old. The defendant was initially very affectionate to the plaintiff and her son, but recently changed his attitude, treating the plaintiff like an unwanted fan in autumn and cutting off her living expenses. Forced to do so, she filed a lawsuit requesting a legal investigation and a judgment ordering the payment of living expenses for the plaintiff and her son. The case was heard by Criminal Division Chief Liao Yan, who repeatedly held hearings and summoned the defendant Wu Zhihao, who appointed lawyer Wang Zudong to appear in court on his behalf. The court instructed the lawyers of both parties to go out and negotiate a settlement and adjourned the hearing for further review. These circumstances have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the case has been settled out of court by both parties. Wu Zhihao paid Wang Heying and her son Yuan Xin a certain amount of living expenses in one lump sum, and a contract was signed and held by each party. The plaintiff, Wang Heying, then petitioned the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court to withdraw the private prosecution.</p>
<h3>Cai Tian, a Key Criminal in a Gang Fight Case, Arrested</h3>
<p>Now Held in the Detention Center Awaiting Trial by the Court</p>
<p>Chen Xiaoheizi, a Cantonese member of the Qunyi Triad at No. 30 Xihua Road, and Chen Yousheng, a Jiangxi member of the Yinglian Triad at No. 9 Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, on April 6th of this year, at 9:50 p.m., gathered dozens of people to fight with broadswords and axes near Haining Road and Miller Road over a debt dispute on behalf of their fellow gang members. As a result, Chen Xiaoheizi was stabbed to death. The Chinese and foreign detectives of the Hongkou Police Station then escorted Chen Yousheng and Cai Hua and others to the First Special Court, where they were sentenced separately. They confessed that the key criminal, Cai Tian, a Cantonese, was at large. Yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m., Chinese detective Fang Fucheng arrested him at No. 9 Puyi Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei, and took him to the police station to await trial by the court.</p>
<h3>Accusation of Seduction of Mother and Daughter Leads to Countersuit</h3>
<p>Xu Zhang Relies on Marrying Off Her Daughter for a Living</p>
<p>Xu Zhang, a local woman, has a daughter named Jinmei, who possesses some beauty. She was betrothed to Yan Ruzhang, a fellow villager, when she was young, but the engagement was never terminated. She then had an affair with a Mr. Zhang, and later sold her to Cui Jiajun of Yancheng as a concubine for the price of three hundred yuan. Having married off her daughter three times, the woman had made enough profit. Recently, she instigated her daughter to sue Cui in the local court for criminal abuse, seduction, and deprivation of freedom. Cui then hired lawyer Chen Guangyuan and presented evidence to refute the charges. Today, the court found him not guilty. Cui, feeling aggrieved, filed a countersuit against Xu Zhang and her daughter for fraud, theft, and false accusation.</p>
<h3>Two Women Dispute Property, Court Orders Witnesses to Be Summoned for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>Fan Qiaosheng, a resident of Chenxing Township, District 5, Shanghai County, Pudong, and his adoptive mother, Fan Li, sued Fan Zhao and Xing Zhigang, the district chief of District 5, in the local court for encroaching upon more than 40 mu of farmland belonging to their adoptive father Zhang Shuntang. A hearing had been held once before. The plaintiff alleged that Fan Zhao was Zhang Shuntang's concubine and colluded with Xing Zhigang to falsely report the loss of the land deeds. Yesterday, the judge continued the hearing. Fan Zhao hired lawyer Pan Zhensheng and filed a countersuit, stating that Fan Qiaosheng was her husband's nephew and had not been adopted. Fan Shuntang and Fan Zhao were a remarried couple and had one son and two daughters, so there was no need to adopt a nephew as an heir. Fan Li was her husband's mistress. When her husband died of illness on February 14th of last year, Fan Qiaosheng came to seize control of the funeral arrangements and grabbed the deceased's head, leading to a conflict. District Chief Xing upheld justice and forced him to retreat in disgrace. The next day, he tricked her into going to the township office for mediation, and he sneaked back and snatched three small boxes, one containing land deeds, one containing documents, and one containing jewelry, as well as three passbooks and three ledgers. After listening to the fair suggestions of the township head and others, he published a statement in the newspaper and asked the district chief to report the matter to the county government. However, the fields were still cultivated and rented out by her. Fan Li had no children and Fan Qiaosheng deceived and bullied the widow. She requested that the court punish them. The court ordered that witnesses be summoned for further questioning.</p>

It is said that Song took the plane to Hankou and then transferred to Kuling.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Pays Attention to the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Checking Bank Accounts</p>
<p>Since the situation in North China has become chaotic, some speculators who disregard the interests of the country have taken the opportunity to manipulate the government bond market, causing great anxiety among the people. The financial authorities have learned of this situation and, in addition to strictly investigating and clarifying the market, have decided to send personnel to Shanghai to check the accounts of various banks.</p>
<p>Kong is Concerned</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, who was dispatched to overseas, has repeatedly telegraphed Vice Minister Xu Kan, instructing him to properly manage finance and banking, and has also used international wireless telephone to communicate with Xu at any time, instructing him on how to deal with the situation and take practical measures to crack down on speculation in the bond market and stabilize the bond market.</p>
<p>Decision to Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>After receiving the telegram from Finance Minister Kong, Finance Vice Minister Xu Kan once declared Kong's intentions to various leaders from all walks of life and asked them to cooperate in stabilizing the situation. He also ordered the relevant departments of the Ministry of Finance to immediately send personnel to Shanghai to check the accounts of various banks to provide a basis for verification and handling, so as to thoroughly crack down on speculators and manipulators and clarify the government bond market.</p>
<p>Financial Stability</p>
<p>According to news from the financial circles of this city yesterday, at a time when the atmosphere between China and Japan is tense and the situation in North China is uneasy, the financial situation in this city is active and very stable, and has not been affected in any way. This is due to the close connection between the government and the people, and the financial circles are earnestly assisting the government. The legal tender reserves are sufficient and the credit of government bonds is outstanding, which has long been trusted by both Chinese and foreigners.</p>
<p>Three Banks Profit</p>
<p>Finance Vice Minister Xu Kan, after receiving the order from Finance Minister Kong, arrived in Shanghai by plane from Kuling last Wednesday to oversee financial matters. Xu has been extremely busy in Shanghai for days, handling important financial matters. It is also reported that he has ordered the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to make as much profit as possible on government bonds and calculate the lowest interest rates, so all brokers are happy to handle them. It is expected that the future of the bond market will be stable and optimistic.</p>
<h3>Flour and Grains are Firm and Stocks are Sufficient</h3>
<p>Flour Association Prevents Exports; Shipments to Beiyang Must Have Proof</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, flour and grains in this city have been consistently firm. At a time when the situation is tense, it not only affects people's food supply but also affects social stability, so all parties are paying close attention to this. The following is what the reporter has learned from various relevant parties:</p>
<p>Market Prices Soar</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, the number of shipments of flour from this city to North China has been very large, especially to Tianjin. As a result, flour prices in this city have been rising daily. Although the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has set price limits in the exchange, spot transactions still exceed market prices, reaching about four yuan and three jiao per bag. The reason for the soaring market prices is entirely due to the large-scale purchases and shipments by merchants. According to the current market conditions, new wheat is being harvested and raw materials are coming in continuously. All the ten or so flour mills in this city are now fully operational and rushing to produce goods every day. In terms of ordinary supply and demand, there should be no reason for such a high price increase.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Exports</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance ordered the customs to temporarily prohibit the export of wheat flour from Shanghai for shipment to other places and transshipment, all ships that had loaded wheat flour were seized by the customs. As for the Flour Association, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from having other intentions, it has notified all factories that those who purchase flour for shipment to Beiyang should handle it with caution. Whether for civilian or military use, they should have reliable proof. Other grains shipped to Beiyang should also have proof from official organizations or legal entities. However, after the customs detained exported flour, flour manufacturers in this city sent representatives to the Ministry of Finance to request instructions on how to ensure the transportation of flour for domestic military and civilian use.</p>
<p>Emergency Preparations</p>
<p>Recently, the true situation of the current situation is confusing. The grain industry in this city is paying close attention to this in order to prepare for any eventuality. According to the current situation, the daily grain requirement of the citizens of this city is about 12,000 dan, and the current inventory is sufficient for two months. However, if the situation unfortunately expands, the grain reserves must be sufficient. Therefore, the grain industry in this city is actively preparing for the grain problem in emergency times. If something happens, the people should fulfill their obligations to the country and make full preparations for food in advance. After the event, they should facilitate the transportation of grain, start from their own positions, and do their best. Special attention should be paid to preventing unscrupulous merchants who take the opportunity to profit.</p>
<h3>U.S. Transport Ship and the Issue of American Nationals Leaving Beiping</h3>
<p>Most Have No Intention of Leaving; No Need to Seek Assistance from the Authorities</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that the U.S. transport ship Chaumont is currently berthed in Shanghai, preparing to return home 500 officers and sailors whose terms of service in China have expired. Yesterday, it was rumored that the ship had been ordered to prepare to sail to North China to carry American nationals in Beiping to the south. Inquiries to the U.S. naval circles in this city failed to confirm this statement. According to the U.S. Naval Purchasing Office, the ship will weigh anchor at 3:00 a.m. on Monday and sail to San Francisco. According to a spokesman for the U.S. Consulate General in this city, American nationals and travelers in Beiping have no intention of leaving. According to a message from the U.S. diplomatic commissioner in the north, American nationals who wish to leave Beiping now do not need to seek assistance from the authorities.</p>
<h3>China-UK International Wireless Telephone to Open in Early August</h3>
<p>Test Calls Continued Last Night</p>
<p>Since the China-U.S. and China-Japan telephone communication has been realized, the Ministry of Communications ordered the Shanghai International Radio Station and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to continue preparing for China-UK and China-Germany wireless telephone communication. In the technical part, China-UK communication has long been tested and completed. In terms of formalities and contact, the British side has also telegraphed its representative in Shanghai to go to Beijing to formally complete the signing procedures with the Ministry of Communications a few days ago. According to the reporter of the Shenzhou News Agency, after the signing procedures for China-UK communication are completed, it has been decided that the official communication will begin in early August. The price of all China-UK communication has been roughly drafted before, and it will be announced soon. It is also learned that the International Radio Station, as the China-UK communication is about to officially begin, continued to test the communication with the British side last night at 10:00 p.m. The results were satisfactory and reached the highest ideal. Therefore, after the official opening, it is expected that users will be fully satisfied. The date of China-Germany communication is about September or October before the communication can be realized. The International Radio Station is now working on the preparation for the China-France and China-Italy communication test work.</p>
<h3>Flood in Fujian; Shanghai Compatriots Plan to Beg for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Meeting Scheduled for the 25th to Discuss; Sa Zhenbing and Others Come to Shanghai to Preside</p>
<p>Since floods occurred in Fujian Province, fellow villagers from the province who are in Shanghai have been actively carrying out disaster relief work. In addition to telegraphing the Provincial Disaster Relief Association Chen Peikun, General Sa Zhenbing, Chairman Lin, and others to come to Shanghai to preside over all matters, they also telegraphed the Beijing Disaster Relief Committee to allocate funds for disaster relief. It is now learned that Chen and Sa will arrive in Shanghai on the 22nd or 23rd of this month to attend the meeting held by the fellow villagers on the 25th. The Eastern Disaster Relief Committee also replied by telegram yesterday, saying, "To the Fujian fellow villagers in Shanghai: The First Department of the Military Commission Chairman's Office has transferred your telegram reporting the serious flood disaster in Fujian Province and requesting disaster relief to the conference. This case has been approved by your committee, and we have replied by telegram as before. In addition to waiting for the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds, we will make overall arrangements and reply separately."</p>
<h3>South African Commercial Representative Birandon to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Plans to Establish a Wool Factory in Shanghai</p>
<p>In order to develop Sino-African trade, the South African Federal Government specially hired the overseas Chinese merchant Zhu Chu as a commissioner for Sino-African commodity survey this spring to return to China for work. Zhu has repeatedly visited major factories in Shanghai, paying attention to the price, quality, and sample collection of domestic products in order to sell them to Africa. At the same time, he promotes African specialties such as tobacco and wool to our country, seeking mutual benefit. Zhu also visited the International Trade Bureau yesterday for consultations. The reporter happened to meet Zhu and learned that when Zhu left Africa for China, he suggested that the South African government establish a large-scale felt carpet factory in China as an initial step to facilitate Sino-African trade. Therefore, Zhu started by surveying commodities. The South African Ministry of Industry and Commerce highly praised Zhu's suggestion, and the South African Federal Government also instructed its commercial representative to the Far East, Birandon, to come to Shanghai to plan. Birandon, who resides in Batavia in the Far East, has already departed for China and will arrive in Shanghai within this week.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Consul General in Shanghai, Branco, to Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Transferred to Consul General in Genoa, Italy</p>
<p>Brazilian Consul General in Shanghai, Branco, has notified the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Concession Board of Works of his departure from Shanghai after receiving an order from his government to be transferred to Consul General in Genoa, Italy. It is now learned that Branco has scheduled to depart for Italy on the German postal ship Persdan on the 28th to take up his new post. The Chilean Chargé d'Affaires in China, Huajia, and consuls general of various countries in Shanghai have been giving him farewell banquets in recent days.</p>
<h3>Chen Lifu Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Standing Committee Member Chen Lifu returned to Beijing a few days ago from Lushan, where he attended a symposium. Because he was concerned about the situation in North China, he visited Foreign Minister Wang the day before yesterday for discussions. Because of dealing with official business in Shanghai, he left Beijing on the night express train at 11:00 p.m. the day before yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 7:00 a.m. yesterday. After getting off the train, he went to his residence to rest. He will stay for a day or two and return to Beijing after finishing his business.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Association Distributes Relief Funds to Disaster Areas in Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu</h3>
<p>The Jisheng Association of this city, which has been actively engaged in disaster relief in various provinces, spares no effort. This spring, it jointly organized emergency relief work in Dengfeng County, Henan Province, with the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association. The emergency relief work has now been completed, and the work relief is being supervised. A total of 61,000 yuan has been used for disaster relief, as reported in previous newspapers. Subsequently, due to the severe drought disasters in Sichuan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces, the Chinese and Foreign Charity Association went to Sichuan and Gansu to distribute relief funds, allocating 5,000 yuan to Sichuan and 2,000 yuan to Gansu, totaling 7,000 yuan. It was sent to the association yesterday for distribution on its behalf, selecting extremely poor households in the disaster areas of the two provinces and distributing an additional two yuan per household to do their best. A report will be made after the work is completed. The association had previously sent 2,000 yuan in silver to the Chang'an branch in Shaanxi Province to organize a small water conservancy project, which was to be undertaken by the Shaanxi branch, with some additions. A reply has been received and is being planned. After a location has been selected, a letter will be sent to handle it. The association has raised 1,000 yuan for Guizhou Province and sent it to the Renji Hall on Yunnan Road, the Guizhou Disaster Relief Association, for transfer and distribution. A large number of relief medicines were also allocated and transported to the disaster areas: 6,500 bottles of Jisheng Dan and other relief medicines for Sichuan Province, 5,000 bottles of relief medicines for Guizhou Province, 4,000 bottles of relief medicines for Shaanxi Province, and 3,000 bottles of relief medicines for Gansu Province.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>Donations Should Not Stop</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>Because Mr. Song Zheyuan, citing "The army has a responsibility to defend the territory, which is its duty," returned donations from all parties, the anxieties of all parties have deepened, especially for us ignorant commoners, because we can't figure it out for a while, and we can't help but feel panicked, thinking that Mr. Song really has a heart of "feeling ashamed to receive it", then the situation in North China is not even more difficult; Now, after reading the explanation from the Shanghai office of the 29th Army, it is said that Mr. Song has repeatedly expressed to people that in the past, donations from all parties comforted Ma Zhanshan and the 19th Route Army's resistance, and then donations were not directly given to lower-level soldiers. Song believes that the army is supported by the country and should have its due salary. Resisting the enemy is the duty of soldiers and should not receive extra rewards from the people, which also shows his hard work for the country, and so on. Only then did we know that Mr. Song originally had his "hard work", and rejecting donations was to show his "self-preservation". In the past, commoners did not seem to care about these "annoyances" when they aided Ma Zhanshan and the 19th Route Army, because their resistance to the enemy was a fact; and it was also a fact that the soldiers at the front became more energetic because of the public's generosity; What the people seek is resistance to the enemy, and those who can resist the enemy will have no complaints even if they die, and what is the value of money! And during the January 28th Incident, the people became one with the lower-level soldiers because of the convenience of donations, and were as close as brothers, which is a good lesson we can never forget; The brothers of the 29th Army shed blood at Xifengkou in the past, and were able to continue to resist after the Wanping Incident. Can we sit idly by and do nothing to save such good brothers? Can we not express our infinite concern with a little bit of money and things?</p>
<p>"Donations cannot be directly given to lower-level soldiers, etc.," is naturally something that wise senior officials do not want to hear. But even if it is a fact, it is only a matter of method. Mr. Song is wise and naturally understands; and it is precisely because of the "annoyances" that we should answer the "annoyances" with facts. As long as we have a "clear conscience", we can ignore this set of things. What a great man does is to seek peace of mind, what else can he ask for? But now, because the donations were returned, suspicion has been aroused among the people, and the enemy has just had one more opportunity to spread rumors and sow discord. The "hard work" has not been accomplished, and right and wrong have arisen. Otherwise, are the people fools, willing to let the white and white money be pocketed by others?</p>
<p>And also because Mr. Song refused to accept donations, we should not stop watching. It is the brothers of the entire 29th Army who are resisting the enemy and defending the territory, and not Mr. Song Zheyuan alone; In the future, if the war to defend the nation breaks out, it will be the entire army of soldiers who are resisting the enemy, and not just limited to the 29th Army; Then, the use of donations will be upright in the future, how can it be stopped now because of the refusal of one or two people? We know that the role of comfort is not as much about material assistance as it is about spiritual encouragement, and it is even more important to communicate with the resistance brothers on the front line through a small amount of material media. There are precedents for this, so how can the donation campaign be stopped! What we want to express is that beyond the limited number of brothers on the front line, there are still people from all over the country standing behind them, and the front line and the rear have closely joined hands!</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Japanese side is conducting so-called "peace" negotiations with the officials of the Tianjin and Hebei-Chahar Political Council; On the other hand, it threatens to mobilize 400,000 troops to prepare for aggression; The so-called content of peace negotiations transmitted by the telegram is confusing, making it impossible for people to know the truth; In addition to responding to the telegram from more than 1,000 citizens in Tianjin, opposing humiliating peace, we must also shout loudly; Donations should not be stopped!</p>
<p>For the sake of China tomorrow, we should take a consistent attitude with the soldiers who are resisting the enemy on the front line. We want to resist to the end, we want to drive the enemies of China out of Chinese territory!</p>
<h3>Are We Going to Succumb Again?</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army fired the first shot at Lugouqiao, Chinese and Japanese troops have been in constant conflict for days, creating a very dangerous situation. However, in the situation where the two armies are facing each other, the diplomatic authorities of both sides are still working hard to coordinate and are striving for peace. According to the latest news, the overall situation has a tendency to ease. Everyone may be elated to hear this news, thinking that the crisis can be averted. But I am even more pessimistic!</p>
<p>According to those responsible for conducting the negotiations, the urgent task at hand is to make the troops on both sides retreat to a distance to avoid continued "friction". This method is naturally good, but this contact was initiated by the Japanese side. It is reasonable for the other side to withdraw its troops, but it is unacceptable for our side to withdraw its troops. If a country's army is attacked by foreign troops and still has to succumb, how can it be said that it still has sovereignty?</p>
<p>From past experience, China has always suffered in every conflict with Japan. If this incident is resolved peacefully, it can be asserted that the Japanese side will at least freely control key positions in North China. Since the other side has taken action, it will never give up easily without obtaining considerable compensation. But this loss to our country is truly not small!</p>
<p>After a peaceful resolution, China and Japan may be able to live in peace for a while. However, this situation is temporary. If the other side's policy of aggression towards China does not change for a day, disputes will not be avoided for a day. Today's peace cannot</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>guarantee tomorrow's conflict. Then, with each "friction", our country loses its rights once. China is difficult to maintain, and it cannot withstand the carving up of those with limitless ambitions!</p>
<p>Therefore, the only way for our country to deal with this is to resist! Naturally, I also understand that the strength of China and Japan is vastly different, and it is dangerous to easily advocate war. However, although war is not a blessing for our country, peace is not a benefit for our country either. Although the authorities have stated that they will never conduct negotiations that humiliate the country, I believe that an unconditional resolution is impossible under these serious circumstances. Only resistance can seek survival from death. Moreover, the other side's oppression over the years has left our country with no room to breathe. If we succumb again at this time, the future of the country will be unimaginable!</p>
<p>Diplomatic coordination is currently underway. I hope that everyone will closely monitor what methods the authorities will use to achieve a resolution that does not lose our rights. The Lugouqiao Incident is a critical moment for our country's survival. Our country's path to life is here, and the path to death is also here. Once we take the wrong step, the fate of the entire nation may fall into a tragic situation from which it can never recover!</p>
<h3>On the Tram</h3>
<p>— Laborious Mind</p>
<p>For some trivial matter, we are accustomed to a kind of ridiculous argument; in the murmur of the argument, we have already forgotten what places the tram has passed. When our argument ceased, the tram was already crawling westward on Nanjing Road.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of silence, a new stimulus again caused a ridiculous dispute between us.</p>
<p>“Look!”—It started with my simple and well-intentioned words.</p>
<p>“What is worth looking at?”</p>
<p>"Your temper is always like this," I also seemed impolite in reply. "Even if you don't think it's worth seeing, take a look!"</p>
<p>"It's my temper again? —This is just a mother and her six daughters."</p>
<p>This is just a mother and her six daughters:</p>
<p>The mother is only in her thirties, and the daughters, if standing in a line, would be just right, one taller than the other. In my clumsy view, even if their ages are not similar, they probably wouldn't be too far apart; and their faces are so similar: a mother and her six daughters.</p>
<p>"Six! A young mother raised six daughters, maybe there are sons too." I glanced at my friend who didn't care about anything. My words were swallowed from my throat into my stomach, murmuring to myself...</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of them interrupted my reverie.</p>
<p>"Stupid girl, lean over here!... Ah, thank you, sir!... Still not coming here, you little wretch!... What are you arguing about again?..."</p>
<p>"Mom, are we there yet?"</p>
<p>"Mom, I want to sit! She took my spot, I..."</p>
<p>"Mom, my feet hurt!"</p>
<p>"Why don't you stand still! The tram is swaying violently, get closer to Mom!... Your feet hurt? Sit next to Mom!... Sigh, really!... Lean on Mom a little, don't block other people's way... Look, you snot-nosed kid..."</p>
<p>The mother was sitting in the corner by the door, the smallest one sitting in her arms. The tallest one, about eight or nine years old, was standing with her back against the door; the next oldest was standing in front of her sister; and the next oldest was standing in front of her. The other two were squeezed next to their mother when a passenger stood up to offer a seat.</p>
<p>"If there were sons, that would be real luck, really!" An old woman sitting next to us said sympathetically and emotionally. Later, I don't know how, she started chatting with the mother.</p>
<p>"Oh, it's so tiring to have so many children!... You, still not sitting properly,... if you don't sit still, I'll beat you to death, you stinky girl... So annoying!"</p>
<p>"You are blessed: one a year, or two every three years?"</p>
<p>"Two every three years! Alas, all money-losing goods, what's the use... You, not listening to me, squeezing over there, hum!... But, if I have a little brother this year,... don't squeeze, just stand!</p>
<p>"The woman next door to me is also very lucky, she had one last year, and another one is almost a month old this year. Maybe she will have a chubby brother next year..."</p>
<p>"That's a blessing from a previous life... Sigh, don't you have heels? My feet are hurting from you leaning on them... We're here, we're here. Don't be impatient. I'm really exhausted by you six!... Sigh, isn't it, seeing people have little brothers as easily as hens lay eggs, if I could have one too,... sigh, I wonder if I have that blessing?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Their conversation was drowned out by the cries of the old newspaper vendors at the tram stop, and that mother and her seven very similar-looking daughters got off the tram at this stop. The tram stopped at the station for a few more minutes for them. And when the tram had started, the eyes that I focused on the platform saw this great mother: her thin face was carved with deep wrinkles of hardship.</p>
<p>When I turned back to face my indifferent friend, just about to use mocking words to start our habitual argument, I was saddened by his very sudden words:</p>
<p>"Is this what a woman's life is like?"</p>
<h3>Huang Yao Sells Calligraphy to Console the Brave Soldiers on the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Yao, his creation of "Cow Nose" has already caused a sensation in society. His calligraphy is as smooth and round as silver chains, and his strokes are as firm as iron castings. Wherever his brush goes, his strength reaches, all exuding a high spirit and agile energy. His mature skill hides a childlike innocence. Countless people love and seek his calligraphy. Now that North China is in danger, Mr. Huang Yao is willing to write one hundred pieces of calligraphy to console the brave soldiers on the front lines, encouraging them to bravely kill the enemy! Each piece only charges ten yuan for ink, purely writing poems with national spirit (writing upon request is also acceptable). The deadline for submissions is two weeks. The document should be sent to China Books and Magazines Company at 380 Fuzhou Road, Shanghai (out-of-town registration is required). Fellow compatriots with hot blood, we deeply hope you will participate enthusiastically!</p>
