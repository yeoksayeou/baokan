<h3>我軍各路均佔優勢吳淞區敵軍完全消滅</h3>
<p>張華浜蕰藻浜敵軍覆沒　羅店殘敵已成强弩之末　張總司令詳談一週戰况</p>
<p>截至今晨四時止、我軍各路陣錢、除閘北·江灣·楊樹浦一帶、固守原有陣地外、其餘沿江沿海各口岸、均佔優越形勢、且有相當之進展、茲將各路戰况、槪述如後、㊀羅店以北至瀏河之綫、敵雖屢次進犯、仍難突出我方重兵之圍、昨晚我軍三面進撲、頗為得手、㊁獅子林至吳淞口一帶、經我軍一晝夜之搜索、已將殘敵完全肅淸、㊂張華浜至蕰藻浜沿浦之敵軍、被我猛烈攻擊、潰退江邊後、早已失去憑藉、㊃浦東方面、我方防備嚴密、敵實無隙可乘、雖敵機與敵艦、不時有無目的之轟擊外、並無激烈戰事、</p>
<p>中央社記者於昨晚八時、偕外籍記者兩人、赴××軍次、訪××總司令張治中、至今晨一時始返滬、承張氏於軍事倥伆中、接談一小時、對敵軍於吳淞區與羅店區登岸後、激戰經過、與最近前錢情形、暢談甚詳、茲摘要彙誌如次、</p>
<p>登陸敵軍之確數</p>
<p>敵軍於二十三日在吳淞區、及羅店區同時登陸、其部隊為第六第十“兩師團所混合編成、人數計一師團、師團以下之番號、就敵軍俘虜及死屍檢查、所可確定者為第四十三、四十七兩聯隊、敵軍登陸時、以陸海空三軍聯合之猛烈火力作掩護、而我軍則僅以步兵抵禦、且沿江防綫太長、兵力不能集中一處、敵軍到處進擾、捉摸不定、故欲根本阻止其登陸企圖、事實上極爲困難。</p>
<p>吳淞區敵已消滅</p>
<p>敵軍在吳淞區登陸者、計有獅子林·砲臺灣·蕰藻浜·張華浜等處、當時我軍、扼守該處者為、保安隊、敵軍來勢極為兇猛、惟我保安隊官兵、深知其責任之重大、沉着抵抗、寗死不退、故犧牲頗為壯烈、旋經調某精銳部隊前往增援、遂展開猛烈之血戰、經一書夜之苦鬥、獅子林砲台灣一帶敵軍、完全被我消滅、截斷其與羅店方面登岸部隊之聯絡、蕰藻浜之敵、旋亦驅逐凈𧗊、惟張華浜敵軍扼險苦門、為其最後登陸根據地、奮死掙扎、直至令晨、（卽二十九日）始被我軍完全解决、綜計敵軍登岸、亘時一週、損失以吳淞區最為慘重、我軍獲此勝利之代價、亦相當壯烈、</p>
<p>羅店敵已被包圍</p>
<p>竄至羅店鎭之敵軍、係由川沙口登岸、來勢極為兇猛、常時我扼守羅店鎭者、為某師某旅、全為步乓應戰、在敵軍大砲與飛機轟擊之下、犧牲之壯烈得未曾有、至二十四日卒告不支、羅店鎭遂淪陷於敵軍之手、並有向前推進之摸樣、一時形勢頗為緊追、惟幸賴我忠勇將士、抱定興守土共存亡之決心、不稍退却、使我應援部隊、得及時趕到、二十五日向敵軍迎頭痛擊、前仆後繼、敵軍雖有銳利之武器、卒不敵我忠勇將土有進無退之勇氣、經一晝夜之血戰、敵軍不支潰退、我軍於克復羅店鎭後、乘勝追擊、迫敵退至羅店西北隅、隔河對峙、二十八日敵曾一度反攻、被我擊退未逞、現羅店鎭已化悉灰燼、而此區殘敵亦已成強弩之末被我包圍、不久當可解決、</p>
<p>浦東敵亦曾登岸</p>
<p>在沿江一帶血戰之際、浦東方面南匯一帶、亦曾有敵軍兩聯隊、在敵艦砲火掩護下登陸、經我砲兵準確之轟擊、與步乓奮勇之肉搏、卒將敵軍擊退、計登陸步隊、生還者僅十之一而已、關於虹口楊樹浦一帶、我突進部隊、確稍後撤、并改攻勢爲守勢、在沿江一帶激戰之際、此爲必然採取之戰略、不足為奇、惟敵軍亦未敢向我進犯、故近數日來、前錢極爲沈寂、僅偶有小接觸而已、</p>
<p>雙方戰略之概論</p>
<p>張氏於縱談一週來戰局後、並對雙方戰略、作一概論云、敵軍登陸後、如於三日內儘量發展其威力、擴展戰區確為一艱於應付之事、我軍之所以能化險為夷者、第一由於扼守部隊之不惜犧性、其次為應援部隊能迅速抵達、奮勇進攻、再者我空軍每夜飛臨敵陣轟炸、亦予我陸軍莫大之幫助、現在血戰已歷一過、敵軍經我壓迫、盤踞之區域、僅及最初登陸時十分之一、且我沿江一帶、已由中央派定大員指揮、防務鞏固、可告無患矣、關於砲兵威力、張氏頗致讚美之詞、謂滬戰爆發以來、我砲兵以標的準確之射擊、迭予敵軍以重創、敵空軍每日偵察我砲兵陣地、迄今尚未發現、張氏並證實我軍曾擊沉敵艦兩艘之消息、謂如有人至吳淞口外視察、尚可一睹此被燬敵艦之殘跡云、</p>
<h3>張華浜敵軍全覆沒</h3>
<p>血戰四小時敵潰退　我收復張華浜車站</p>
<p>確息、張華浜登陸敵軍、計一千餘名、自經前晚下令總攻後、該處我守軍、莫不用命、浴血挺進、同時我空軍亦出動助戰、予敵軍以重創、經四小時之血戰、敵終不支、向沿江邊鐵路工廠碼頭潰退、我軍立卽進展至張華浜車站附近要點、並繼續以大包圍形勢、向江邊碼頭進擊，當時敵軍已失去憑依、戰弘削弱、複被我砲火壓迫之下、損失奇重、喪亡枕藉、已成强弩之末、我軍乘勝痛剿勢如破竹、至昨晚十一時懅前方報告、張華浜已完全入我軍之手、敵軍全部淹沒、我軍現正嚴陣以守、固若金湯、</p>
<p>羅店瀏河敵軍潰退</p>
<p>今晨三時接前方確實消息、瀏河以迄羅店、一帶已被登陸之敵軍、總數約達兩放團之衆、歷四十餘小時之血肉搏戰、敵軍終屬不支、至昨晨止、敵軍己金綫崩潰、被我逼向海岸退却、重重包圍、三面進樸、敵處此進退失據之際、亦曾屢思奪圍、但終未得逞、同時敵艦曾以重砲遙應、希圖解圍、亦未被算、惟我方為迅速解决計、愛於昨晚增厚兵力、集向沿岸一帶猛撲、戰事至為激烈、我軍步步進逼、形勢絕對優越、肅淸之期、當不在遠、中央社云、日來羅店方面之戰事、激烈異常、前日午後、敵軍又曾一度衝入羅店鎭、當晚卽經我軍分三路猛烈反攻、肉搏十餘處、仍將敵軍擊退至盛橋木杓鎮及陳家行一帶、我軍并由某處截斷敵軍後路、敵現在我軍包圍中、</p>
<p>敵衝閘北傷亡殆盡</p>
<p>（本報特訊）江灣閘北一帶敵軍於前晚增援陸軍接防從、卽下全綫總攻令、更以主力部隊進襲閘北、攻擊我寶山路一帶、一時坦克車機關槍砰砰亂發、我註軍伏處防禦綫內、絕不作聲、敵以爲退却矣、欣喜欲狂、乃放膽前進、我軍俟其衝過防綫、左右四處、呼喊而起、將頑敵包圍、敵倉皇失措、混戰一小時許、敵大部傷亡殆盡、零星殘敵退入租界、生還者不足十分之二、誠作戰中之痛快事也、</p>
<p>中央社云、昨晚八字橋方面又數度小接觸、敵軍屢向我軍陣地圖進、我軍沉着應戰、予以迎頭痛擊、敵終不得逞、雙方仍在原陣綫對峙中、</p>
<p>敵在虹口埋置地雷</p>
<p>據虹口方面來人談、該處仍由陸戰隊駐守、並無正式陸軍、且有多數之便衣隊及在鄕軍人、在該區域內甚為活動、該項隊伍所佩臂章上、均書“大日本商兵勞動團”字樣、大部敵人在黃浦碼頭大阪碼頭匯山碼頭、一帶集合、並在自三菱碼頭起經百老匯路楊樹浦路而至蘭路為止、埋置地雷、在外虹橋方面亦有重乓駐守、並有鐵絲網沙包等陣碍物甚多、在两旁行人道下、亦有地雷埋置、</p>
<p>敵艦砲轟浦東無效</p>
<p>前晚十一時半、虹口浦面所泊日艦、又向浦東一帶開砲轟擊、一時隆隆之聲、響徹雲霄、我軍亦還砲抵禦、歷半小時後、日艦復用機關槍向岸上掃射、我軍置之不理、越二十分鐘始稀、至昨晨二時、又砲戰約半小時、察其用意、似在試探浦東軍力、一般觀察、日艦昨日午後紛紛由淞口駛回、恐將另有企圖、但我浦東駐軍、已嚴加戒備、日兵如欲登陸、必遭殲滅無疑、</p>
<p>又訊、昨前兩日、沿海敵艦紛紛開進浦江、遂於昨晨四點、對我浦東南市無的開砲、隆隆之聲、震動星宇、每分鐘約有數發、共發數十響、察其用意、又欲在該處試探我軍之防務、但我軍事長官早有計劃、敵再來犯、定必迎頭痛擊狡猾之敵軍、萬難登岸</p>
<p>我機今晨飛滬轟炸</p>
<p>我空軍於今（三十）晨零點五十分、兩點十五分、兩次飛滬夜襲、在敵艦高射砲亂射聲中、從容在虹口及楊樹浦敵軍陣地投擲炸彈多枚、並赴淞轟炸敵艦、旋卽安然飛返、</p>
<p>敵機四出轟炸肆虐</p>
<p>⊙閘北　中央社訊敵機三架、於昨午十二時半、飛往閘北轟炸、並在北站一帶、投擲炸彈十餘枚、中有一彈落於新疆路、當卽起火、燃燒甚烈、計燬民房一百餘間、又據工部局消息、昨日（二十九）下午十二詩三十五分、日機四架、在北火車站擲彈、不下十二枚之多、四彈墜於車站之西南首、其中一彈落於上海特區法院北首、約三百碼之遙、致使公共租界界綫附近着火、但至下午一時、該處附近、並無其他火警、　⊙新龍華　昨日下午三時許、有敵機十餘架、在龍華漕涇四週盤旋偵察、約十餘分鐘後始去、至四時許復來、在新龍華車站後面擲彈六枚、　⊙南市沿江　昨日淸晨、有敵機偵察機數架、復來南市沿江一帶偵察、時來時去、惟飛行甚高、至十時許始息、但至中午十二時許、又有敵機五架、由北駛至、在城廂一帶往返、但較上午為低、至一時許折回、⊙北蔡鎭　浦東南匯縣屬北蔡鎭、離滬約二十里、並非軍事地帶、日機昨忽飛往投彈炸燬市房三四間、死傷民衆二十餘人、</p>
<p>官方息、二十八日下午四時許、我軍在蒹藻浜撃落日機一架、當時該機擊炸彈、致墜落時復遭炸燬、同時在江灣路跑馬廳附近、亦擊中敵機一架、起火墜地、事後檢視餘燼、發見有九艦四爆愛知一一五號左等字樣、</p>
<p>昨日浦江敵艦總數</p>
<p>昨日各敵艦停泊所在及各碼頭實際情况、據記者親赴浦面調查所得，約如下述、三菱公司碼頭、泊驅逐艦一艘、一號浮筒驅逐艦一艘、二號浮筒出雲旗艦一艘、六號浮筒砲艦一艘、八號及九號浮筒各泊驅逐艦一艘、怡和紗廠浦面蘭路浦面及三井碼頭各泊驅逐艦一艘、同興紗廠浦面及西溝各泊砲艦一艘、綜計自西溝至北京外灘一段浦面、共泊敵艦十一艘、西溝以下、因記者未往、故其停泊情形、不得而知、據記者沿途目觀公和祥碼頭、招商局中棧及匯山碼頭、有敵軍多人、起卸彈械、至為忙碌、匯山碼頭積有敵死屍甚夥、多以灰色布包裹、於每屍之首結有白色布條、寫明死者姓名、由此可見敵軍之傷亡甚衆、共他除大阪碼頭有敵軍三百餘外、其餘各碼頭、則闐無一人、</p>
<p>朝日丸載傷兵歸國</p>
<p>中央社、敵輪朝日丸、此次駛滬、原為載運傷兵及難民而來、故該輪除於旗杆高縣紅十字旗幟外、並於烟囱及船身漆有紅十字標幟、　　本定前晨開山、嗣因傷兵衆多、不及裝載、故廷至昨日（二十九日）上午十時半、始駛離招商中棧碼頭返日、</p>
<h3>長谷川尚日報吿侵滬損奇重</h3>
<p>軍士死亡五千餘人　飛機損失四十二架</p>
<p>中央社云、敵第三艦隊司令長谷川、會於本月二十七日向日海陸軍省報告上海戰事之損害情形、估計自本月十三日開戰以來、敵第三艦隊所指揮之第十戰隊、第十一戰隊及第五驅逐艦隊、已受傷之軍士、達七千六百餘人、已死之軍士、達五千八百餘人、軍艦方面有巡洋艦兩艘受傷、驅逐艦三艘受傷、砲艦四艘受傷、其中“鳥羽”竟成廢物、運輸艦已有二艦受傷沉沒、飛機包括轟炸·驅逐·偵察·共炸燬及失蹤四十二架、受重創者十六架、輕創者二十二架、（包括由台灣機場飛來者在內）唐克車毀壤者四輛、受創者十二輛、其僑民死亡者、亦達六百餘人、</p>
<h3>吳淞絕無敵蹤</h3>
<p>我砲火密集敵難登陸　獅子林泊有敵艦多艘</p>
<p>據昨日午後三時接到前方報告、吳淞在我軍固守之中、絕無敵踪、該處在過去十二小時之內、平靜無戰事、</p>
<p>昨日、吳淞蕰藻浜北外馬路迤東至砲台灣等地、均在我軍固守中、已無敵軍踪跡、蘊藻浜以南糧米棧碼頭及鐵路工廠一帶、尚有敵軍約一旅團之衆、仍圖憑險頑抗、經我軍自前晚至昨晨八時半止、終宵猛烈攻擊、已將敵驅除至衣周塘浦濱、其時江中敵艦上雖有援軍、因我砲火密集、登陸困難、祇能望岸興嘆、故浦濱殘敵、勢將全部殲滅、昨日我軍收復蕰藻浜張華浜爾車站後、戰事稍歸沉寂、迨午後十二時半許、我軍又拔隊向前推進、包圍浦濱殘敵、</p>
<p>據軍意、昨有敵艦三十八艘·及帆船多艘、停泊於淞口獅子林附近、似有企圖掩護敵軍登陸模樣、惟我軍在獅子林方面、駐有重兵、敵方企圖、决難得逞、</p>
<h3>我陸空軍轟擊虹口敵軍受大損</h3>
<p>敵圖反攻根據地卒被燬　我砲隊發砲準確有奇績</p>
<p>困守虹口之敵軍、前晚一度擬向我陣地突圍、雙方接戰、殊為猛烈、企圖反攻之敵軍、終被我軍掃射擊退、同時我後方重砲隊、響應我前綫步隊、亦開始一致之動作、向虹口各敵軍根據地猛轟、砲火密集、描射準確、蓬路吳淞路口之虹口三角地小菜場為敵軍集中根據地之一、當被我彈聲中、其中軍火、立卽爆炸、敵軍死傷無算、蓬路日本俱樂部亦為日軍會議之地、被我轟入兩彈、室中軍官、倉皇四逸、守衞士兵、都被炸斃、匯山碼頭及日本領事館一帶、皆為我砲火之目標、燬傷甚鉅、日人慌忙失措、其他虹口各處、被我擊中者甚多、敵軍懾於我砲火之猛烈、終於不得不向後退縮、</p>
<p>字林報云、北車站後之華軍、昨日（二十八日）日暮後砲轟虹口區、數彈落於蓬路、一彈擊中虹口菜市、一彈穿過虹口捕房印捕住所、但未有何死傷、又昨夜八時三十分、有華軍所發砲彈數枚、落於日領事署附近、一彈在日本郵船會社貨棧側爆炸、日領事署玻璃均遭震碎、另有數彈、在蓬路與武昌路附近爆炸、傷日人數名、華軍砲隊間斷轟擊、至昨日深夜始已、</p>
<p>據確報、虹口方面敵軍、集結於大坂碼頭、匯山碼頭、三菱碼頭、百老匯路、楊樹浦以及蘭路一帶、我軍之前哨綫仍在熙華德路附近、與敵軍對峙中、昨晨及昨晚、均有前哨戰、但不甚劇烈、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>抗戰期中的文化教育工作</h3>
<p>— 富</p>
<p>我們長期抗戰的前途是確定的了。隨着長期抗戰的軍事工作的進展。我們政治經濟文化教育以及社會等等工作。也非有相當的注意不可。</p>
<p>我們對於抗戰中最主要的問題。如外交的决策。軍略的决定。民族產業的扶持。都只有信任政府的負責人員一秉公忠。詳加計劃。全國的民衆就隨着他們的指挥。調整了步骤。共同邁進。</p>
<p>這裏笔者要向政府當局提供一點意見的。是關於文化和敎育的問題。我們文化的故都。已在暴敵的魔爪之下。這文化城中的文化工作者。人數比任何地方多。現在他们有的困居於危城之中。有的四出奔波。想在這大時代中。分担一點文化服務的肩责。至於上海。則近十年來。已漸漸成了華中華南的文化樞紐。在著作事業上。在敎育事業上。文化人之結集於上海者。為數也極多。可是目前在敵機敵砲的威脅下。上海的文化事業也陷於僵凍的境地。出版事業停滯了。大中小各公立私立的學校停頓了。自南到北。大多數的文化人。竟束手聽敵人的砲聲。結集在僵凍的都市中。不龍發揮一點文化人應有的力量。</p>
<p>在文化人對面。則是無數對着敵人的威脅而焦急憤怒的羣衆。是無數受着敵人的戰爭威脅。而失學的兒童和青年。在長期抗戰的大時代中。我們决不可以片刻停頓文化和敎育的工作。使羣衆和青年們。發生“心理的空虛”的現象。</p>
<p>這是長期抗戰中。應首先克服的一個大弱點。</p>
<p>在長期抗戰的進展中。我們的經濟組織和社會組織。必然的將有一個大轉變。卽在戰時統制的原則之下。度我們的集體、生活。在文化和敎育事業上。讓我們先來創始這種集體生活的典型。</p>
<p>第一。就出版事業和新聞事業言。則言論報道與發行管理。都應有適當的調劑。對於全國抗戰情報的流通。人民集體行動的指示。政府當局應該作妥善的規劃。至於發行管理。則全國主要報紙可以通力合作。來籌謀便利的方法。我們不妨效法蘇聯。全國定幾個發行中心。以航空輸送紙型傳印。這樣流通可以廣泛。而抗戰意志的統一可更見功，</p>
<p>第二。就敎育事業言。我們要立刻打通大學敎育中學敎育小學敎育以及民衆敎育的壁壘。我們要以一省為單位登記所有的敎育服務人員。所有的需要受敎育的人口。佔量服務者的能力分別在混合的集中的施敎機關內。各依自己的能力担任敎育的工作。同時根據實際的情形。制定抗戰時期的編制課程和敎材。總期學業能切寶合用。與國防有着聯繫而又使必要的科學研究事業。持續勿積。</p>
<p>至於敎育服務者的生活問題。則官廳方面也可以非常時極端經濟的辦法來解决。我想。如果計劃適當的話。以集團生活為原則。以經濟上達制度為方法。由公家負起服務者及其家屬的衣食住等必要生活的責任。而根本取消薪給制。這辦法不但可行。而且有前例可師。一九二九年以後美國一部分敎育界。就作過此類嘗試。而很見成功。</p>

<h3>Our Forces Maintain the Upper Hand on All Fronts; Enemy Troops in Wusong Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Enemy Forces Annihilated at Zhanghuabang and Yunzaobang; Remnants of the Enemy at Luodian Nearing Exhaustion; General Commander Zhang Details the Week's Battle Situation</p>
<p>As of 4:00 AM this morning, our forces held superior positions along all fronts, with the exception of the Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Yangshupu areas, where they were holding their original positions. Furthermore, considerable progress has been made along various coastal ports. A summary of the battle situation on each front is as follows: ㊀ North of Luodian to the Liuhang line, the enemy has repeatedly attacked, but has been unable to break through our heavy encirclement. Last night, our troops launched a three-pronged attack, which was quite successful. ㊁ In the Shizilin to Wusongkou area, after a day and night of searching by our troops, the remaining enemy forces have been completely wiped out. ㊂ Enemy forces along the Yunzaobang River from Zhanghuabang were subjected to fierce attacks, and after retreating to the riverbank, lost their foothold long ago. ㊃ On the Pudong front, our defenses are tight, and the enemy has no opportunity to exploit. Although enemy planes and warships occasionally conduct indiscriminate bombings, there are no fierce battles.</p>
<p>A reporter from the Central News Agency, accompanied by two foreign journalists, visited the headquarters of the ×× Army last night at 8:00 PM, interviewing ×× General Commander Zhang Zhizhong, returning to Shanghai at 1:00 AM this morning. Despite his busy military schedule, Mr. Zhang held a one-hour interview, detailing the fierce battles that occurred after the enemy forces landed in the Wusong and Luodian areas, as well as the latest situation on the front lines. A summary of his remarks is as follows:</p>
<p>The Exact Number of Enemy Landings</p>
<p>The enemy landed simultaneously in the Wusong and Luodian areas on the 23rd. Their troops were a mixed formation of the 6th and 10th "Divisions". The number of troops was estimated to be one division. By examining enemy prisoners and corpses, the 43rd and 47th Regiments were confirmed among divisional subordinate units. When the enemy landed, they used combined intense firepower from the land, sea, and air forces as cover, while our troops only resisted with infantry. Furthermore, the coastal defense line was too long, and troop strength could not be concentrated in one place. The enemy launched attacks everywhere, making it difficult to pinpoint their intentions. Therefore, fundamentally preventing their landing attempts was extremely difficult in practice.</p>
<p>Enemy in Wusong Eliminated</p>
<p>The enemy landed in the Wusong area at Shizilin, Fort Taiwan, Yunzaobang, Zhanghuabang, and other places. At the time, our forces defending these areas were security teams. The enemy's advance was extremely fierce, but our security team officers and soldiers deeply understood the importance of their responsibility, and resisted calmly, preferring death to retreat. Therefore, their sacrifice was quite heroic. Subsequently, elite troops were dispatched to reinforce the area, and a fierce, bloody battle ensued. After a night and a day of hard fighting, the enemy forces in the Shizilin and Fort Taiwan area were completely eliminated, cutting off their communication with the landing troops in the Luodian area. The enemy at Yunzaobang was also driven out. However, the enemy forces at Zhanghuabang, holding a strategic stronghold, struggled to the death as their last landing base, until this morning (i.e., the 29th) when they were completely defeated by our troops. In summary, the enemy's landing lasted for a week, with the most severe losses in the Wusong area. The price our troops paid for this victory was also quite heavy.</p>
<p>Enemy at Luodian Surrounded</p>
<p>The enemy forces that infiltrated Luodian Town landed at Chuanshakou. Their advance was extremely fierce. At the time, our troops defending Luodian Town were a certain division and a certain brigade, all infantry. Under the enemy's artillery and aircraft bombardment, the sacrifice was unprecedented. By the 24th, they could no longer hold out, and Luodian Town fell into enemy hands. They showed signs of advancing, and the situation was quite critical for a time. Fortunately, our loyal and brave soldiers were determined to defend their territory to the death, and did not retreat at all, allowing our reinforcements to arrive in time. On the 25th, they launched a head-on counterattack against the enemy. Despite the enemy's sharp weapons, they were ultimately no match for the courage of our loyal and brave soldiers, who advanced without retreat. After a day and night of bloody fighting, the enemy was defeated and retreated. After our troops retook Luodian Town, they pursued the enemy in victory, forcing them to retreat to the northwest corner of Luodian, confronting each other across the river. On the 28th, the enemy launched a counterattack, but was repelled by us. Currently, Luodian Town has been reduced to ashes, and the remaining enemy in this area is nearing exhaustion, surrounded by us. A resolution should be forthcoming soon.</p>
<p>Enemy Also Landed in Pudong</p>
<p>During the bloody battles along the coast, two enemy regiments also landed in the Nanhui area of Pudong under the cover of enemy warships' artillery fire. Through accurate bombardment by our artillery and the brave hand-to-hand combat of our infantry, the enemy was eventually defeated. Of the landing troops, only one-tenth survived. Regarding the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas, our advancing troops did retreat slightly and changed from offensive to defensive postures. During the fierce battles along the coast, this was a necessary strategic move and is not surprising. However, the enemy did not dare to attack us either, so the front line has been extremely quiet in recent days, with only occasional minor skirmishes.</p>
<p>General Overview of Both Sides' Strategies</p>
<p>After discussing the battlefield situation of the past week at length, Mr. Zhang provided a general overview of both sides' strategies, saying, "If the enemy forces could have maximized their power and expanded the battle zone within three days after landing, it would have been difficult to handle. The reasons why our troops were able to turn the tide were, first, the willingness of the defending troops to sacrifice themselves; second, the ability of the reinforcements to arrive quickly and launch brave attacks; and third, our air force's nightly bombing of enemy positions, which provided great assistance to our army. Now that a week of bloody battles has passed, the area occupied by the enemy, after being pressured by us, is only one-tenth of the area they initially landed on. Furthermore, the coastal area has been assigned to a senior official dispatched by the central government, and the defenses are solid, so there is no cause for concern." Regarding the power of the artillery, Mr. Zhang praised it highly, saying that since the outbreak of the Shanghai battle, our artillery has repeatedly inflicted heavy damage on the enemy with accurate targeting. Enemy aircraft have been scouting our artillery positions every day, but have yet to find them. Mr. Zhang also confirmed the news that our troops had sunk two enemy warships, saying that if anyone were to inspect the waters outside Wusongkou, they could still see the remnants of the destroyed enemy warships.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops at Zhanghuabang Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Enemy Collapses After Four Hours of Bloody Fighting; We Recapture Zhanghuabang Station</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the enemy troops who landed at Zhanghuabang numbered over a thousand. Since the general attack was ordered the night before last, all of our defending troops there fought with all their might, advancing bravely through bloodshed. At the same time, our air force also dispatched aircraft to assist in the battle, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. After four hours of bloody fighting, the enemy finally collapsed, retreating to the railway factories and docks along the river. Our troops immediately advanced to key points near Zhanghuabang Station, and continued to attack the river docks in a large encirclement. At that time, the enemy had lost its foothold, its morale was weakened, and it was subjected to our artillery fire, resulting in extremely heavy losses and many casualties. They had become exhausted. Our troops took advantage of the situation to launch a fierce attack, which was unstoppable. According to a report from the front last night at 11:00 PM, Zhanghuabang had been completely taken by our troops, and all enemy troops had been wiped out. Our troops are now defending the area in a strong position.</p>
<p>Enemy Troops Retreating at Luodian and Liuhang</p>
<p>According to reliable news received from the front at 3:00 AM this morning, the total number of enemy troops who have landed in the area from Liuhang to Luodian has reached approximately two regiments. After more than forty hours of bloody hand-to-hand combat, the enemy troops ultimately could not withstand the onslaught. As of yesterday morning, the enemy's entire line had collapsed, and they were being forced by us to retreat towards the coast, heavily surrounded, and attacked from three sides. When the enemy found themselves in a situation where they could neither advance nor retreat, they repeatedly attempted to break out of the encirclement, but ultimately failed. At the same time, enemy warships remotely responded with heavy artillery, hoping to relieve the siege, but this was also miscalculated. However, in order to resolve the situation quickly, we added troops last night, concentrating our attack on the coastal area. The battle was extremely fierce. Our troops are pressing forward step by step, and the situation is absolutely superior. The time to eliminate the enemy should not be far off. According to the Central News Agency, the fighting in the Luodian area has been extremely fierce in recent days. The day before yesterday afternoon, the enemy troops once again broke into Luodian Town, but that night our troops launched a fierce counterattack in three directions, engaging in hand-to-hand combat in more than ten locations, and still managed to repel the enemy troops to the areas of Shengqiao, Mujiaozhen, and Chenjiahang. Our troops also cut off the enemy's retreat from a certain location. The enemy is now surrounded by our troops.</p>
<p>Enemy's Assault on Zhabei Results in Near Total Casualties</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from This Newspaper) The enemy troops in the Jiangwan Zhabei area increased their troop supports the day before yesterday and issued a general offensive order, using their main force to attack Zhabei, attacking the area of our Baoshan Road. At one point, tanks and machine guns were firing wildly. Our garrison was lying in ambush within the defensive line, making no sound. The enemy thought that we were retreating, and became ecstatic, boldly advancing forward. Our troops waited for them to break through the defensive line, and then shouted and rose up from all sides, surrounding the stubborn enemy. The enemy panicked, and after about an hour of melee combat, most of the enemy were killed or wounded. Scattered remnants of the enemy retreated into the concession, with fewer than two-tenths of them surviving. This was truly a satisfying event in the battle.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, there were several small skirmishes in the Bazihui area last night. The enemy troops repeatedly attempted to advance on our positions, but our troops responded calmly, giving them a head-on blow. The enemy ultimately failed, and both sides are still facing each other on the original front line.</p>
<p>Enemy Planting Landmines in Hongkou</p>
<p>According to people from the Hongkou area, the area is still being guarded by marines, with no formal army units present. Furthermore, there are many plainclothes squads and veteran soldiers who are very active in the area. The armbands worn by these squads have the words "Greater Japan Merchant Soldier Labor Corps" written on them. Most of the enemy are gathered in the Huangpu Wharf, Osaka Wharf, and Huishan Wharf areas, and are planting landmines from the Mitsubishi Wharf, through Broadway Road, Yangshupu Road, and ending at Lanchow Road. Heavy troops are also stationed on the Outer Hongqiao, with many obstacles such as barbed wire and sandbags. There are also landmines planted under the sidewalks on both sides.</p>
<p>Enemy Warships Bombarding Pudong Ineffectively</p>
<p>At 11:30 PM the night before last, Japanese warships anchored in the Hongkou Pudong area once again bombarded the Pudong area, and at one point, the sound of the bombardment reverberated through the sky. Our troops also returned fire in defense. After half an hour, the Japanese warships fired machine guns at the shore, but our troops ignored them. The firing stopped after another twenty minutes. Until 2:00 AM this morning, there was another artillery battle for about half an hour. Their intention seemed to be to test the military strength of Pudong. According to general observations, Japanese warships sailed back from Songkou yesterday afternoon, fearing that there might be other plans. However, our Pudong garrison has been on high alert, and if the Japanese soldiers attempt to land, they will undoubtedly be annihilated.</p>
<p>According to another report, the enemy warships along the coast sailed into the Huangpu River one after another in the past two days, and then at 4:00 AM yesterday morning, they indiscriminately opened fire on our Pudong and Nanshi areas, and the sound of the bombardment shook the universe. There were about several shots fired every minute, for a total of dozens of shots. Their intention seemed to be to test our military defenses in the area, but our military officers had already made plans, and if the cunning enemy troops dared to attack again, they would definitely be met with a head-on blow, making it impossible for them to land.</p>
<p>Our Aircraft Flew to Shanghai This Morning to Bombard</p>
<p>Our air force flew to Shanghai twice for night raids this morning (30th) at 12:50 AM and 2:15 AM. Amidst the enemy warships' barrage of anti-aircraft fire, they calmly dropped several bombs on enemy positions in Hongkou and Yangshupu, and went to Songkou to bomb enemy warships, before safely flying back.</p>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Indiscriminately Bombarding and Wreaking Havoc</p>
<p>⊙ Zhabei: According to the Central News Agency, three enemy aircraft flew to Zhabei yesterday afternoon at 12:30 PM to bombard the area, dropping more than ten bombs in the North Railway Station area. One bomb landed on Xinjiang Road, immediately starting a fire that burned fiercely, destroying more than 100 civilian houses. According to news from the Shanghai Municipal Council, four Japanese aircraft dropped no fewer than twelve bombs on the North Railway Station yesterday (29th) afternoon at 12:35 PM. Four bombs fell on the southwest end of the station, and one of them landed about 300 yards north of the Shanghai Special District Court, causing a fire near the boundary line of the Public Concession. However, there were no other fires in the vicinity as of 1:00 PM that afternoon. ⊙ Xinlonghua: Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, more than ten enemy aircraft circled around Longhua and Caojing for reconnaissance, leaving after about ten minutes. They returned again around 4:00 PM, dropping six bombs behind the Xinlonghua Railway Station. ⊙ Nanshi Along the River: Yesterday morning, several enemy reconnaissance aircraft came to the Nanshi area along the river to conduct reconnaissance from time to time. However, they flew very high, and the activity ceased around 10:00 AM. But around 12:00 PM, five enemy aircraft flew from the north to the city area, flying back and forth, but lower than in the morning. They turned back around 1:00 PM. ⊙ Beicaizhen: Beicaizhen, in the Nanhui County of Pudong, is about twenty miles from Shanghai and is not a military zone. Yesterday, Japanese aircraft suddenly flew there, dropping bombs and destroying three or four market houses, killing and injuring more than twenty civilians.</p>
<p>According to official news, our troops shot down a Japanese aircraft at Jianzaobang around 4:00 PM on the 28th. At the time, the aircraft was hit by a bomb, and was destroyed by another explosion when it crashed. At the same time, a Japanese aircraft was hit near the Shanghai Race Club on Jiangwan Road, caught fire, and crashed to the ground. After examining the remains, the words "Navy Type 94 Bomber Aichi 115" were found.</p>
<p>Total Number of Enemy Warships in the Huangpu River Yesterday</p>
<p>The actual situation of where each enemy warship was anchored and at each pier yesterday, according to a personal investigation by a reporter in the Huangpu River area, is approximately as follows: One destroyer was anchored at the Mitsubishi Company Pier, one destroyer was anchored at Floating Dock No. 1, the flagship Izumo was anchored at Floating Dock No. 2, one gunboat was anchored at Floating Dock No. 6, one destroyer was anchored at each of Floating Docks No. 8 and No. 9, one destroyer was anchored at each of the Ewo Cotton Mill, Lanchow Road, and Mitsui Wharf, and one gunboat was anchored at each of the Tung Hing Cotton Mill and Xigou. In summary, a total of eleven enemy warships were anchored in the Huangpu River area from Xigou to the Bund outside Beijing. The anchoring situation below Xigou is unknown, as the reporter did not go there. According to the reporter's observation along the way, many enemy soldiers were loading and unloading ammunition and weapons at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf, China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf, and Huishan Wharf, and they were very busy. A large number of enemy corpses were piled up at Huishan Wharf, mostly wrapped in gray cloth, with a white cloth strip tied to the head of each corpse, stating the name of the deceased. This shows that the enemy's casualties are very heavy. Other than the Osaka Wharf, which had more than 300 enemy soldiers, there was no one else at the other wharves.</p>
<p>Asahi Maru Carrying Wounded Soldiers Back Home</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The enemy ship Asahi Maru came to Shanghai this time to transport wounded soldiers and refugees. Therefore, in addition to flying the Red Cross flag on the flagpole, the ship also had Red Cross symbols painted on its smokestack and hull. The ship was originally scheduled to depart the day before yesterday, but due to the large number of wounded soldiers, it was unable to load them all, so it was postponed until yesterday (29th) morning at 10:30 AM before it left the China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf and returned to Japan.</p>
<h3>Hasegawa Reports Heavy Losses in the Invasion of Shanghai</h3>
<p>More Than 5,000 Soldiers Killed; 42 Aircraft Lost</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Enemy Third Fleet Commander Hasegawa reported to the Japanese Naval and Army Ministries on the 27th of this month regarding the damage situation in the Shanghai battle. It is estimated that since the start of the war on the 13th of this month, the Third Fleet's Tenth Squadron, Eleventh Squadron, and Fifth Destroyer Squadron have suffered more than 7,600 wounded soldiers and more than 5,800 dead soldiers. In terms of warships, two cruisers were damaged, three destroyers were damaged, and four gunboats were damaged. Among them, the "Toba" was completely destroyed. Two transport ships were damaged and sunk. A total of 42 aircraft, including bombers, fighters, and reconnaissance aircraft, were destroyed or went missing, 16 were heavily damaged, and 22 were lightly damaged (including those flying from Taiwan airfields).

<h3>No Enemy Traces in Wusong</h3>
<p>Our Dense Artillery Fire Makes it Difficult for the Enemy to Land; Many Enemy Warships Anchored at Shizilin</p>
<p>According to a report received from the front at 3:00 PM yesterday, Wusong is firmly held by our troops, with no enemy traces. There have been no battles in the area in the past twelve hours.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Wusong, Yunzaobang, the area east of North Wai Ma Lu, and Fort Taiwan were all firmly held by our troops, with no traces of the enemy. There were still about a brigade of enemy troops in the area south of Yunzaobang, near the grain and rice storage docks and the railway factory, still stubbornly resisting the danger. Our troops launched a fierce attack from the night before last until 8:30 AM yesterday morning, finally driving the enemy to the Yizhutang River. At that time, although there were reinforcements on the enemy warships in the river, landing was difficult due to our dense artillery fire, and they could only sigh at the shore. Therefore, the remaining enemy on the shore will be completely annihilated. Yesterday, after our troops retook the Yunzaobang and Zhanghuabang railway stations, the fighting subsided slightly. Around 12:30 PM in the afternoon, our troops advanced again, surrounding the remaining enemy on the shore.</p>
<p>According to military intelligence, 38 enemy warships and many sailboats were anchored near Shizilin in Songkou yesterday, seemingly attempting to cover the enemy's landing. However, our troops have heavy troops stationed in the Shizilin area, and the enemy's attempt will definitely fail.</p>
<h3>Our Army and Air Force Bombard Hongkou, Inflicting Heavy Losses on Enemy Troops</h3>
<p>Enemy's Attempt to Counterattack Base Ultimately Destroyed; Our Artillery Team's Accurate Firing Achieves Miraculous Results</p>
<p>The enemy troops trapped in Hongkou attempted to break through our positions the night before last. Both sides engaged in a very fierce battle. The enemy troops attempting to counterattack were ultimately driven back by our troops' gunfire. At the same time, our rear heavy artillery team responded to our front-line infantry, and began to act in unison, fiercely bombarding the enemy's bases in Hongkou. The artillery fire was dense and the aiming was accurate. The Hongkou Triangle Area Small Vegetable Market at the intersection of Peng Road and Wusong Road was one of the enemy's concentrated bases, and it was immediately bombed by us, with its ammunition exploding. The enemy troops suffered countless casualties. The Japanese Club on Peng Road was also a place where the Japanese army held meetings. It was hit by two bombs, and the officers inside fled in panic, and the guarding soldiers were all killed. The Huishan Wharf and the Japanese Consulate area were all targets of our artillery fire, and were heavily damaged. The Japanese were panicked. Many other places in Hongkou were hit by us. The enemy troops, terrified by the ferocity of our artillery fire, finally had to retreat backwards.</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post, the Chinese army behind the North Railway Station shelled the Hongkou district yesterday (28th) after sunset. Several shells landed on Peng Road, one shell hit the Hongkou vegetable market, and one shell went through the Hongkou Police Station's prison cells, but there were no casualties. Also, at 8:30 PM last night, several shells fired by the Chinese army landed near the Japanese Consulate, one shell exploded on the side of the Japanese Mailship Company's cargo warehouse, and the glass of the Japanese Consulate was shattered. Several other shells exploded near Peng Road and Wuchang Road, injuring several Japanese people. The Chinese army's artillery team fired intermittently until late last night.</p>
<p>According to reliable reports, the enemy troops in the Hongkou area are concentrated at the Osaka Wharf, Huishan Wharf, Mitsubishi Wharf, Broadway Road, Yangshupu, and Lanchow Road. Our forward line is still near Seward Road, facing the enemy troops. There were skirmishes yesterday morning and last night, but they were not very fierce.</p>

<p>—Text of the Treaty Officially Released Yesterday—</p>
<p>Denouncing war as a means of resolving international disputes; Denying war as an instrument for implementing national policy; Agreeing not to commit any aggression against each other; In the event of one party being subjected to aggression, the other party shall not assist the aggressor.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Non-Aggression Treaty signed between China and the Soviet Union in Nanjing on August 21st was officially announced simultaneously in Moscow and Nanjing on the 29th. The full text of the treaty and the remarks of our Foreign Ministry spokesman on its content and significance are recorded below:</p>
<p>Full Text of the Non-Aggression Treaty</p>
<p>Desiring to contribute to the maintenance of general peace and to consolidate the existing friendly relations between the National Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on a firm and permanent basis, and desiring to reaffirm the obligations undertaken by both Parties under the Treaty for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris on August 27, 1928, the two Governments have decided to conclude the present Treaty and have appointed as their Plenipotentiaries: For the National Government of the Republic of China, His Excellency Wang Chung-hui, Minister of Foreign Affairs; For the Central Executive Committee of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, His Excellency D. Bogomoiff, Ambassador of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics to the Republic of China; Who, having communicated to each other their full powers, found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles:</p>
<p>Article 1. The two High Contracting Parties solemnly reaffirm their declaration contained in the Treaty for the Renunciation of War signed at Paris on August 27, 1928, that they condemn recourse to war for the solution of international controversies, and renounce it as an instrument of national policy in their relations with each other, and, in pursuance of this pledge, agree to refrain from any aggression against each other either individually or jointly with one or more other Powers.</p>
<p>Article 2. In case either of the High Contracting Parties should be subjected to aggression on the part of one or more third Powers, the other High Contracting Party undertakes that during the whole period of the conflict it will not give aid or assistance of any kind to such third Power or Powers, and will not take any action or enter into any agreement which might be used by the aggressor or aggressors to the disadvantage of the Party subjected to aggression.</p>
<p>Article 3. The provisions of the present Treaty shall not be interpreted as affecting or modifying the rights or obligations arising out of bilateral or multilateral treaties previously concluded by the two High Contracting Parties before the coming into force of the present Treaty.</p>
<p>Article 4. The present Treaty is executed in two copies in the English language.

<p>In witness whereof the above-mentioned Plenipotentiaries have signed the present Treaty and have affixed thereto their seals.</p>
<p>Done at Nanking this twenty-first day of August, one thousand nine hundred and thirty-seven.</p>
<p>Wang Chung-hui Bogomoiff</p>
<p>Remarks by Foreign Ministry Spokesman</p>
<p>Regarding the signing of the Non-Aggression Treaty between China and the Soviet Union, the Foreign Ministry spokesman recently issued a statement elaborating on the content and significance of the treaty as follows: The signing of the Non-Aggression Treaty between China and the Soviet Union on August 21st not only adds another layer of protection for peace between the two countries, but also serves as a precursor for Pacific nations to jointly seek security through non-aggression guarantees. China and the Soviet Union have now reaffirmed the principles of the 1928 Kellogg-Briand Pact, that is, both parties reiterate that they will not use war as a method of resolving international disputes, and deny the use of war as an instrument of national policy in their mutual relations. In accordance with this principle, both parties agree not to commit any aggression against each other, either alone or in conjunction with other countries. Furthermore, in the event that one of the contracting parties is invaded by a third country, the other party agrees not to provide any assistance to the aggressor, or take any action that is detrimental to the invaded country. Therefore, the content of this treaty is extremely simple and purely passive in nature, that is, using non-aggression and non-assistance to aggressors as a way to maintain peace. The text is concise and the purpose is just and great, and it is indeed a powerful supplementary document to the Kellogg-Briand Pact and other treaties for maintaining peace. In the past decade, many countries around the world have concluded non-aggression treaties. Even countries with vastly different ideologies have often concluded such treaties. The Non-Aggression Treaty signed between China and the Soviet Union is no different from those concluded by other countries. Although it is still a precedent among Pacific countries, it is in line with the world's goal of ensuring peace. Although China is currently suffering from extreme foreign aggression and cannot but resist force with force, a deep love for peace is a characteristic of the Chinese people. If those who are currently aggressing against us with force can suddenly realize and change their national policy, then we are also willing to sign a non-aggression treaty with them to jointly maintain the security of East Asia and seek the happiness of mankind. The conclusion of the Non-Aggression Treaty between China and the Soviet Union may be a sign of a turn for the better in the overall situation in East Asia. This is what we hope for. (Central News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Soviet Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, met with a Reuters reporter today and expressed satisfaction with the signing of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, and hoped that the friendly relations between the two countries could be further consolidated on the basis of the new treaty.

<h3>Soviet Union Demands Japan Close Two Consulates</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government has recently demanded that Japan close its consulates in Vladivostok (in the Ukrainian Republic) and Novosibirsk (in Siberia) by September 15th. According to an agreement between Japan and Russia, the number of consulates established by the two countries should be the same. The Soviet Union has recently closed its consulates in Hailar and Sakhalin, and ◻ therefore made the above request to Japan. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>Remains of Outer Mongolian Army Chief Arrive in Russian Capital</h3>
<p>Cause of Sudden Death is Poisoning</p>
<p>[Moscow] According to消息 recently disclosed by official circles here, General Demid, the Army Chief of Outer Mongolia, and Khorlo, the Division Commander, suddenly passed away on August 22nd while traveling by train near Tomsk.

There were also several others who died from eating the poisonous food.

<h3>Britain Sends Note to Japan Demanding Guarantees</h3>
<p>Note's Wording is Stern and Reasonable; Punishment and Apology Alone are Insufficient to Quell Anger</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the case of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, being injured by Japanese aircraft fire, the Foreign Office sent a note this afternoon to Tao Zidai, the chargé d'affaires in Japan, instructing him to deliver it to the Japanese government. The full text of the note will be released here as soon as it is delivered to the Japanese government. According to well-informed sources, the content is nothing more than three points: ㊀ The British government believes that the expression of regret by Japanese Ambassador Yoshida to the British government is insufficient. ㊁ The Japanese airmen who fired on Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen should be severely punished. ㊂ Japan should formally acknowledge that similar incidents will not happen again and must provide concrete guarantees. Although the nature of these guarantees is unknown, it is generally believed that they will be related to the demarcation of a neutral zone. Furthermore, the wording of the note is said to be moderate, but the tone is quite stern. It also refutes some of the defenses made by Japanese spokespersons and states that Japan should provide appropriate compensation if Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen's diplomatic career is affected. Diplomatic circles believe that the most important point of the note is the request for a method of providing guarantees. The demands put forward by Britain are reasonable and represent a minimum requirement. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[London] Well-informed observers believe today that the apology expressed by Japanese Ambassador Yoshida to the Foreign Office for the injury of British Ambassador to China Knatchbull-Hugessen cannot be considered a formal apology. (Guomin Dian, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Acting Ambassador Rushes to China</h3>
<p>Departed by Plane Yesterday; Expected to Arrive in Hong Kong Next Tuesday</p>
<p>[London] Mr. A. H. George, Counselor of the British Embassy, has been instructed to serve as Acting Ambassador. Mr. George, who was on vacation here, has already boarded the Imperial Airways seaplane 'Caledonia' and is rushing to China. It is estimated that he will arrive in Hong Kong on the 7th of next month, and then take a British warship or a British Royal Air Force plane to Shanghai to take charge of embassy affairs. (Havas dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen Out of Danger</h3>
<p>Condition Continues to Improve</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Dr. Gottelet, the doctor treating Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador, stated yesterday that the ambassador is out of danger and is expected to recover in about six or seven weeks. Yesterday, the ambassador only met with his wife, who then announced that the ambassador's condition prevents him from meeting with any visitors. It is reported that the hospital is still receiving many messages of condolence from various places yesterday. According to officials, the car and the accompanying car in which the ambassador was traveling both had British flags prominently displayed on the roof, with the flags measuring 27 inches in length and 18 inches in width. Japanese aircraft could certainly have seen them from the air, so there can be no excuse.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Condemn Japanese Atrocities</h3>
<p>[London] The Sunday Times said in its editorial today that the Japanese aircraft's shooting of British Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen was an act of provocation against the world. Japan's only good policy is to admit its mistakes and apologize, but Britain needs more than that from Japan. Japan must take reasonable steps to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Furthermore, if Japan is not prepared to cease fire, then it should declare war. This is perhaps one of the most important things. If it does not declare war, then it is doubtful whether Japan has the right to blockade the coast of China. The Observer said that Londoners now believe that the Japanese government will quickly agree to apologize and compensate for the incident that has shocked countries around the world, in order to prevent the disaster caused by the injury of the British Ambassador from escalating further. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 29th)</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Konoe Daydreams of Conquering China by Force</h3>
<p>Deliberately Makes Empty Threats; Economic Foundation is Shaken</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Japanese Prime Minister Fumimaro Konoe declared today, 'The current situation has made diplomatic negotiations with Nanjing impossible. Japan's only path today is to strike China hard to make her submit and no longer have the spirit of resistance.' According to officers returning from the Chinese battlefield, this Sino-Japanese war will be a long one, lasting until next spring, or even next autumn. In order to overcome Chinese resistance, Japan has decided to mobilize a large army to China. Therefore, twenty retired generals have been ordered to return to the battlefield, and the strength of the army has now doubled, and will be tripled later. According to the current situation, Shandong and Guangzhou will soon become destinations for Japanese military aircraft. (Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to various Japanese newspapers here, various securities and stocks on the Japanese stock market repeatedly plummeted on the 26th of this month. The local financial and economic circles deeply believe that the Sino-Japanese war will be prolonged, and the working capital in the market is extremely limited. The newspapers also stated that all banks across the country are now unable to expect foreign deposits and have no choice but to request loans from the Bank of Japan, thereby exacerbating the situation of currency inflation.

<h3>Cultural and Educational Work During the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The future of our long-term War of Resistance is certain.  Along with the progress of military work in the long-term War of Resistance, we must also pay considerable attention to our political, economic, cultural, educational, and social work.</p>
<p>Regarding the most important issues in the War of Resistance, such as diplomatic decisions, military strategies, and support for national industries, we can only trust the responsible government personnel to be fair and dedicated, and to plan carefully.  The people of the whole country will follow their command, adjust their steps, and advance together.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to offer a piece of advice to the government authorities regarding cultural and educational issues.  Our cultural capital has already fallen under the claws of the brutal enemy.  The number of cultural workers in this cultural city is more than anywhere else.  Now, some of them are trapped in the dangerous city, while others are running around, trying to share the responsibility of cultural service in this great era. As for Shanghai, it has gradually become the cultural hub of Central and Southern China in the past ten years. The number of cultural figures gathered in Shanghai for writing and education is also extremely large. However, under the threat of enemy planes and cannons, Shanghai's cultural undertakings are also in a state of stagnation.  The publishing industry has stagnated, and public and private schools of all sizes have been shut down. From South to North, most cultural figures are listening helplessly to the enemy's artillery fire, gathering in stagnant cities, unable to exert the strength that cultural figures should have.</p>
<p>On the other side of the cultural figures are countless people who are anxious and angry in the face of the enemy's threat, and countless children and young people who have lost their schooling due to the enemy's war threat. In the great era of the long-term War of Resistance, we must not stop cultural and educational work for even a moment, lest the masses and young people experience a phenomenon of "psychological emptiness."</p>
<p>This is a major weakness that should be overcome first in the long-term War of Resistance.</p>
<p>In the progress of the long-term War of Resistance, our economic and social organizations will inevitably undergo a major transformation. That is, under the principle of wartime control, we will live our collective lives. In cultural and educational undertakings, let us first create a model of this collective life.</p>
<p>First, in terms of publishing and journalism, there should be appropriate adjustments in speech, reporting, and distribution management. The government authorities should make proper plans for the circulation of national War of Resistance information and the guidance of collective actions by the people. As for distribution management, major newspapers across the country can work together to plan convenient methods. We may as well learn from the Soviet Union and establish several distribution centers across the country, using air transport of printing plates for transmission. In this way, circulation can be widespread, and the unification of the will to resist can be more effective.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of educational undertakings, we must immediately break down the barriers between university education, secondary education, primary education, and mass education. We must register all educational service personnel and all people in need of education by province. We should assess the ability of service providers and assign them to mixed and centralized educational institutions, each taking on educational work according to their ability. At the same time, we should formulate a wartime curriculum and teaching materials based on the actual situation, with the goal of ensuring that academic studies are practical and useful, linked to national defense, and that necessary scientific research continues without interruption.</p>
<p>As for the livelihood of educational service personnel, the government can also solve it with extremely economical methods for extraordinary times. I think that if the plan is appropriate, with group living as the principle and an economically sound system as the method, the government can assume responsibility for the necessary living needs of service personnel and their families, such as clothing, food, and housing, and fundamentally abolish the salary system. This method is not only feasible, but also has precedents to follow. After 1929, some educational circles in the United States made similar attempts and were very successful.</p>

<h3>The Front Lines Were Quiet This Morning, and the Remnants of the Enemy in Luodian Are Still Surrounded by Us</h3>
<p>Our Troops Have Advanced to the Jiangyan Area; A Large Number of Enemy Ships Are Moving to Liuhe Again</p>
<p>From last night until this afternoon, there were only small contacts on the front lines. Both sides' plainclothes teams were extremely active, but it was irrelevant to the gains and losses of the war. In the Yangshupu, Jiangwan, and Zhabei areas, after the enemy's fierce attack failed the night before last, except for the enemy planes bombing Zhabei, all roads were deeply fortified and dared not easily come out. The remnants of the enemy in the Zhanghuapai area were also entrenched and waiting for reinforcements. In the Shizilin and Liuhe areas, our forces were strong, and enemy ships gathered on the sea, constantly firing probes, attempting to take the opportunity to land, but ultimately failed. As for the Luodian area, the enemy launched repeated counterattacks, suffering heavy casualties. Moreover, our new reinforcements were gathered, and the positions were extremely strong. The enemy did not dare to try easily for the time being. Starting at dawn this morning, dozens of enemy planes came to bomb our positions again, but they did no damage to our defensive works. It is said that the enemy has suffered too many casualties in recent days and is now actively reorganizing and calling for help. Our army is waiting in strict formation, adopting a strategy of segmented encirclement and individual annihilation, so that no enemy troops who land will survive.</p>
<p>It is confirmed that the enemy ships around Wusongkou have been attacking our Shizilin, Xiaochuansha, and Luodian areas for several days, but have been repelled by us, suffering heavy damage. They have now changed their plans. This morning, the remnants of the enemy in various places returned to their ships one after another. A large number of enemy ships moved to Liuhe, intending to move their main force to that place. However, we have already seen through this conspiracy, and the enemy will definitely not succeed.</p>
<p>According to reports received from relevant parties, the front lines were quite quiet this morning, and the enemy in the Luodian area is still surrounded by our army.</p>
<p>The enemy on North Sichuan Road has launched several counterattacks against our Zhabei area in recent days, but has been repelled by our army. As of this morning (30th), there have been no changes in our front lines. The North Station area has been the place where the enemy has concentrated its forces to attack fiercely for several days, but it is still in our hands, and there is no trace of the enemy.</p>
<h3>Our Army in Luodian Has Advanced to the Jiangyan Area</h3>
<p>We Will Definitely Be Able to Reach Jiangkou Tonight; The Remnant Enemy's Front Lines North of the Town Are Chaotic</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) According to a report from this newspaper's war correspondent, 1. After our army captured Luodian Town a few days ago, the vanguard troops have now advanced to the Jiangyan area. The Jiangshuitatao River at Xiaochuanshakou can be clearly seen. We will definitely be able to reach Jiangkou tonight. 2. In the Luodian area, in addition to deploying new troops on the front to advance rapidly, the □□ and other units are advancing side by side on the left and right wings. After this, the enemy army will never be able to land in that area. 3. There are still about 2,000 remnants of the enemy north of Luodian Town constructing fortifications, hoping to hold on. They were facing our army across the river yesterday. The rivers in that area are winding, and there are many ports and rivers. The water is deep enough to drown people. Our army is trying to cross the river. The enemy's front lines are already chaotic. 4. Our army has deployed new front lines along the coast of Liuhe, Shizilin, and Wusong, enough to deal with any strong enemy.</p>
<h3>Small Contact at Baziqiao This Morning</h3>
<p>Our Troops Rushed Out, and the Remnant Enemy Collapsed</p>
<p>This morning, the trapped remnants of the enemy on the northern road of Baziqiao suddenly attempted to attack our army's positions, plotting to break out. Our defenders were prepared and immediately launched a fierce attack. After a small contact of about 20 minutes, the enemy's forces were unable to support themselves and collapsed and retreated. It is reported that the enemy's conspiracy to break out this morning was to break out of our army's encirclement and meet with the remnants of the enemy in the Wenzaobang area. However, our army's defenses were solid, and after a fierce attack on the enemy, the enemy was already in disarray.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Sailed Near Shizilin</h3>
<p>Intending to Cover the Troops There to Advance Towards Luodian</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) According to a confirmed report from Wusong, the 38 Japanese ships anchored in Wusong left Wusong yesterday and moved towards the Shizilin battery on the Yangtze River Estuary. It is observed that their intention is to gather in the Shizilin area and then use artillery fire to cover the troops to land there. At the same time, they want to threaten our troops in Luodian and Jiading with artillery fire to cover their troops' advance. Because the enemy army has repeatedly attacked Luodian in recent days, they have been defeated and repelled. According to the Shizilin area, it is about twelve or thirteen miles away from Luodian.</p>
<p>According to reports from the Yangshupu area, the enemy flagship Izumo was anchored outside Zhoujiazuibang Beikou in the Huangpu River at 8:00 this morning. The Japanese cruiser "Sendai" was docked at the pier of the Osaka Shosen Kaisha, near the Wangwan Racecourse. It is reported that a fire broke out this morning, which must have been caused by a shell hit.</p>
<p>The enemy flagship Izumo, anchored at buoy No. 2 in the Huangpu River, suddenly sailed out of Wusongkou at 2:00 this morning and anchored on the sea off Shizilin, leading more than 30 enemy ships anchored there, seemingly with the intention of covering the landing again. It did not sail back until noon.</p>
<h3>We Advanced and Stationed in Gaolangqiao This Morning</h3>
<p>Local Residents Were Overjoyed</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) Three days ago, our troops leading from Gaolangqiao to Baoding Road once withdrew automatically due to the fierce fighting along the coast of Wusong and Luodian. At that time, shameless traitors took the opportunity to lead the enemy in, robbing, killing, and looting, doing everything. Factory buildings along Qiqihar Road and Qipu Road were set on fire and destroyed. This morning at around 5:00 at dawn, our army re-entered the original positions from Gaolangqiao to Baoding Road. The residents were overjoyed when they saw it.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Reconnoitered Nanshi This Morning</h3>
<p>At around 10:30 this morning, two enemy reconnaissance planes were found again over Nanshi, circling along the Huangpu River. After more than ten minutes, two bomber planes flew in from the northeast, but after circling for a week, they also fled away without dropping bombs. After the South Railway Station was bombed by enemy planes, ordinary people moved to the concessions one after another, so the area around Laoximen was crowded with people carrying boxes and suitcases on the way. However, as of this morning, the situation has been relatively eased.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships in the Huangpu River Were Sometimes Many and Sometimes Few</h3>
<p>The enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River, in addition to once increasing to 26 ships the day before yesterday, have been decreasing again since yesterday. Now most of the enemy ships are gathered on the sea off Shizilin outside Wusongkou. Even the enemy flagship Yagumo once sailed to that place last night. According to a survey conducted by reporters this morning, the anchoring situation of the ships in the Huangpu River is as follows: one gunboat on the Dinghai Road Huangpu River surface, one gunboat on the Yong'an Yarn Factory Huangpu River surface, one destroyer each on the Lan Road Huangpu River surface and the Waterworks Huangpu River surface, one destroyer and one gunboat each on the Pudong Xinhuishan Wharf, one destroyer each on buoy No. 10 and buoy No. 8, one gunboat on buoy No. 6, one destroyer on buoy No. 1, plus the Izumo flagship, which sailed back and anchored at buoy No. 2 at 12:00 today. There are a total of 13 enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River. Along the way, reporters only saw more than 30 enemy troops at the Zhaoshang North Wharf and more than 20 at the Mitsubishi Wharf. The rest were silent and deserted.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Bombed the North Station Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy planes' atrocities continue unabated. They bombed the South Railway Station, which had no military facilities at all, the day before yesterday, killing and injuring 500 to 600 refugees. Yesterday afternoon, four enemy planes bombed our North Station again, killing and injuring more than 300 innocent civilians. Among them, four bombs were dropped near the concessions. In addition to the civilian casualties, the bombs dropped in various places near the North Station did no damage to our army at all.</p>
<h3>Pudong's Defense Is Extremely Solid</h3>
<p>Enemy Planes Shot at Farmers Who Offered No Resistance; This Kind of Behavior Is Inhumane</p>
<p>(Special dispatch from this newspaper) This morning, this newspaper's reporter met with Mr. Jiang, a representative of a certain group in this city who had just returned to Shanghai last night after visiting the troops in the Pudong area, and he described the war situation in the Pudong area in great detail. We have selected the parts that can be disclosed and recorded them below to share with readers who care about the Pudong area.</p>
<p>I (Mr. Jiang claimed himself) crossed the Huangpu River from the Gaochangmiao Wharf in Shanghai on the morning of the 24th of this month. At that time, the small train there had stopped running, so I hired a dirt cart to move forward. Enemy planes soared along the way without end. After traveling more than ten miles, I arrived at a certain place and met with senior military officers to explain my intentions. The officers expressed their gratitude and declared to Mr. Jiang that since the Hongyang Rebellion, the Pudong area had not experienced war, because the Pudong area was a place where farmers and poor workers placed their hopes, and it was a non-armed area. Unexpectedly, after suffering an unexpected blow, the stubborn enemy turned to invade the Pudong area. Therefore, our army was ordered to come here to station overnight. On the night our army arrived, enemy ships suddenly opened fire on us. Our army immediately retaliated with fierce artillery fire. After several nights of fierce fighting, the enemy was frightened. Although enemy planes often came to Pudong to scout and drop bombs in recent days, it was ineffective. What made the enemy most chilling was that they used planes to strafe farmers in small villages and towns who offered no resistance. As for the enemy air force base and the location where the aircraft carrier was parked, it was probably in the sea farther away in the Bailonggang area, because enemy planes were often seen taking off and landing there. It was found that in the first week or so of the war, the enemy used huge logs arranged in rows and many foreign-made motorboats, and they did have the intention of landing in Nanhui and other places, but they never dared to try lightly. Now our army's defenses are becoming more and more solid. If the enemy comes to invade, they will definitely be given a severe blow.</p>
<h3>The Front Line Needs Trucks the Most</h3>
<p>We Hope That the Public Will Actively Provide Them</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Anti-Enemy Support Association, what is most needed on the front line now is trucks. From a military point of view, an ordinary regiment transporting troops needs 108 trucks. Although there are military vehicles in the front-line troops, and this association has also collected a lot, the current expansion of the front line has caused a huge shortage of transport vehicles. Even in terms of rescue, a large number of trucks are needed. Currently, there are only more than ten of these rescue trucks entering and leaving the concessions, and the vehicles transporting the wounded to the rear hospitals are also greatly lacking, so some of the wounded in the front are inevitably abandoned on the battlefield due to the lack of vehicles for transportation, and the situation is extremely tragic. This association has formulated a rental method for collecting trucks, roughly paying 20 yuan per day (including the driver's salary), and the gasoline is supplied by this association. If the truck is damaged or lost due to official business, this association can provide compensation as appropriate. There are also compensation measures for the injury or death of the driver. We hope that those who have trucks will actively provide trucks to meet this major need. If the public knows where and who has trucks, they are also asked to notify this association, or the Bide Primary School on La Fayette Road, so that people can be sent to contact them.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the British Note to Japan Regarding the Case of the Japanese Plane Attacking the British Ambassador</h3>
<p>[London] Regarding the injury of British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by a Japanese plane attack, the British government submitted a note to the Japanese government yesterday. The content of the note was announced at 5:00 p.m. today. The note concludes with three demands: 1. The Japanese government should formally apologize to the British government. 2. The perpetrators in Japan should be punished according to the severity of the circumstances. 3. The Japanese authorities should provide assurances and take all necessary measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. The full text of the translated note is as follows: The note first describes the circumstances of Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen's injury, stating that this accident is regrettable, and the British government is saddened and extremely worried upon hearing the news, and has to lodge a firm protest and demand full compensation. "The way regular combat operations may indirectly create a risk of injury to non-combatants, including foreigners, residing within the borders of related countries is unavoidable. However, international law contains one of the oldest and most definitive regulations, namely, any direct or intentional attack on non-combatants, whether within or outside the war zone, is prohibited, and aircraft attacks should not be treated as exceptions. The argument that the incident was accidental cannot be accepted either, because various facts are sufficient to prove that the Japanese perpetrators were at least negligent in the lives of ordinary people and completely ignored them. In short, this incident was not an accidental event resulting from any regular combat operations, and it is obvious that the Japanese planes attacked non-combatants, which the perpetrators should have been aware of. Also, the Japanese side's claim that the car flags were too small to be seen is also unfounded, because even if the car did not have flags, there is no reason to attack it. Putting aside whether the passengers are foreigners or diplomats, the fact is that they are non-combatants. Now, it is found that the Japanese planes did not intentionally attack the British ambassador, but there is no doubt that they wanted to attack non-combatants, which alone is an illegal act. In addition, there is one more thing that must be noted, that is, there are no Chinese troops in the area where Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was traveling, nor is it a war zone. The British government now takes this opportunity to point out that this case contains a more important meaning, that is, this kind of accident is a natural result of the indiscriminate use of attacks by the air force, and it is even more inhuman and illegal to attack combatants and non-combatants indiscriminately. Moreover, under the current situation, the existence of a state of war has not been declared or clearly recognized by both China and Japan. Therefore, what the Japanese planes have done is even more unforgivable," etc. (Central News Agency, 29th, Havas telegram)</p>
<h3>Britain Has No Intention of Taking Retaliatory Measures in the Case of the Japanese Plane Attacking the British Ambassador</h3>
<p>London, 30th, Reuters - The wording of the British protest submitted to Japan regarding the attack on Ambassador Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen has been carefully considered and is still moderate. The demands put forward are considered by many to be capable of being implemented without harming the dignity of the country. According to the opinion of people from all walks of life in Britain, Japan's imprudent actions that led to this protest can be regarded as a sufficient condemnation. The protest does not mention retaliation. If Japan does not accept the demands contained in the protest, the British government does not intend to take further action. The British side believes that if Japan rejects these demands, it will directly show the world that Japan is ultimately a country that does not respect any international morality. As for the rumors circulating that Britain will demand compensation, according to the opinion of the US government, this matter is of great importance and cannot be settled with money. Demanding compensation would be a loss of dignity. The protest did not set a deadline for the Japanese government to respond, but the British government hopes that the reply can be sent out as soon as possible so as not to prolong the matter.

<h3>Ambassador's Condition Shows Further Improvement</h3>

It has been five days, and his condition is improving day by day. According to the hospital's announcement at 10:00 a.m. today, the ambassador had an exceptionally good night last night (29th), and his condition today (30th) is even more improved.</p>

<h3>Japanese Yarn Factories in Cangkou Have All Been Closed</h3>
<p>[Jinan] As the Japanese are about to evacuate completely, reporters went to inspect the Japanese textile district in Sifang Cangkou on the 29th.

<h3>People in Shanghai Have Been Going to the Interior in Succession in Recent Days</h3>
<p>Railway transportation has gradually returned to normal. Trains depart on time from the West Station (Fanhua Ferry) according to the temporary train schedule. All passenger tickets are distributed at the station and limited according to the train capacity, so the order is orderly. However, the brutal Japanese arbitrarily destroy our transportation and massacre our civilians, so the railway is destroyed every day. However, the Road Bureau works quickly and repairs it as soon as it is destroyed, so the eastbound direction is delayed, but it is not affected at all. The road workers' efforts to maintain transportation are admirable. In recent days, a large number of people have traveled from Shanghai to the interior.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegram to the Military Commission Regarding Retaliatory Action Against the Enemy</h3>
<p>Announce This Edict Domestically and Internationally to Warn the Enemy</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Military Commission yesterday, stating: "To the esteemed Nanjing Military Commission: Since the outbreak of hostilities initiated by the violent Japanese, they have brazenly disregarded international laws of war, indiscriminately bombing civilians, wounded soldiers, and Red Cross personnel. Such instances have become commonplace. Having examined the wartime international laws, it is noted that if one party commits illegal atrocities, the other party may take retaliatory actions, such as not extending preferential treatment to prisoners of war and summarily executing them, not protecting enemy private property and summarily confiscating it, and the like. We propose that Your esteemed Commission first announce this edict domestically and internationally to warn the enemy. If they dare to commit further atrocities, this will be a fundamental measure to protect the lives of the people. We humbly request its adoption and implementation. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Trivial Commentary</h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>The Non-Aggression Treaty signed between China and the Soviet Union in Nanjing on August 21st was announced simultaneously in Moscow and Nanjing on the 29th. According to a diplomatic spokesperson, the content of this treaty is purely passive in nature, namely, not to invade and not to assist aggressor nations as a means of peace. I have carefully examined the articles of the treaty and can offer the following interpretations:</p>
<p>1.  This treaty is purely a friendly treaty of peace between the two countries, and its nature is absolutely different from a military agreement of alliance.</p>
<p>2.  This treaty is a passive opposition to aggressive countries using war as a tool to implement national policy, and it is not an agreement for actively opposing aggressive countries using war as a tool to implement national policy.</p>
<p>3.  This treaty is an expression of our country's political and international commitment to peace. Similar agreements can be concluded with any non-aggressive country. Therefore, except for aggressor countries, it can maintain existing rights and interests in China with respect to other countries and will never infringe upon or eliminate them.</p>
<p>4.  This treaty represents an attitude of goodwill and friendship between our country and the international community, and it has absolutely no relationship to the eradication of the "Red Peril" as resolved by the previous Third Plenary Session.</p>
<p>Therefore, the nature of this treaty is absolutely a peaceful agreement, which only has a spiritual resonance with the current Sino-Japanese war and does not have any practical relationship.</p>
