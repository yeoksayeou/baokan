<p>時評</p>
<h3>日蘇漁業問題</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>介於日蘇之間的鄂霍次克海和白林海是世界三大漁塲之。一大利所在。為日蘇所必爭。年來的日蘇外交大都致力於這方面的漁業問題所以有些人甚至把日蘇外交看作‘漁業外交’而漁業問題的動態也就彷彿成了日蘇外交的測候器。最近日蘇間幾經迂迴曲折。纔簽訂了一個議定書把去年年底滿期的日蘇漁業協定的有效期間延長到今年年底交涉經年的日蘇漁業問題似乎已告一個段落。而日蘇關係的緊張也許因此可以緩和一些。其實我們如果觀察得週密一些。則這個估量。未必盡然了。</p>
<p>日蘇間漁業爭執為時已久。一九○五年的樸資茅斯和約規定舊俄要和日本締結各協定。把鄂霍次克海和白林海的俄國領土沿岸的漁業權讓給日本。開了日蘇漁業糾紛之端。一九○七年。日本和舊俄根據這個規定。締結漁業協定確定日本在那裹的漁區該約至一九一九年期滿失效那時俄國革命雖已成功。但日俄不獨沒有正常的外交關係。且處於敵對地位。日本漁業者就不再受協定的拘束。自由出漁到一九二二年。蘇聯成立。基礎鞏固日本遂和它重行締結臨時漁業協定規定有效期間到一九二六年年底為止。一九二五年。日蘇兩國代表在北京締結協定恢復國交同年兩國代表根據這協定的規定在莫斯科舉行漁業會議。那時日本代表主張以一九○七年的漁業協定做根據協議修訂蘇聯代表則主張根據北京協定第三條的規定。把一九○七年以後日俄間一般事態的演變也採做修約的根據乃日本代表不肯受北京協定的拘束。堅持自己的主張。不稍退讓。因此會議屢陷停頓。到一九二八年。因蘇聯的退讓。纔成立了現行的漁業協定。可是這個協定沒有確定日本的漁區。反予日本以侵佔蘇聯領海的藉口。故實施以來。雙方糾紛迭起。徒然增加了兩國關係緊張的程度。至今兩國間還有許多沒有解决的懸案都是因此發生的。</p>
<p>現行協定的有效期限是八年原於去年五月二十八日期滿在滿期前三日。蘇聯曾經接受日本的要求把這協定的有效期間延長到去年年底希望在這時期內。日本不再威脅蘇聯使兩國緊張關係漸漸緩和下來產生一個新的協定。可是兩國的關係。不但未見好轉而日本威脅蘇聯的情緒反更高漲。去年十一月間兩國間的談判本已漸見接近大有產生新協定的可能乃日本又和德國締結防共協定。威脅蘇聯。致新協定的產生。加上了許多阻碍。但是日本雖一再威胁蘇聯。而蘇聯却不惜對日本再事退讓。同意把現行協定的有效期間再延長一年。使兩國間的漁業糾紛暫時得告一段落。</p>
<p>根據上述。我們可以斷言。日蘇現行漁業協定雖又延長了一年期限。但日本如不改變對蘇聯的態度。新協定不能產生。則日蘇間的漁業糾紛還是不能獲得澈底的解决的。</p>

<h3>鐵城盃籃球賽復旦暨南均獲勝</h3>
<p>市體學生用武發生不幸事件　復旦實中劉人豪被毆受重傷</p>
<p>鐵誠盃籃球賽、昨日三塲甲組、持志險敗於黃蜂、辛隊一蹶不振、敗於復旦、暨南勝五龍、</p>
<p>昨日球賽完畢、在體育館外荒塲上忽聞喊打及救命之聲、趨往調查、見市體專學生數十人、包圍復旦實中學生三人、在大打出手、經勞觀者上前排解、救出重圍、事情本可了結、殊料行至游泳池口、市體學生又蜂踴而來、將復旦實中－學生打傷倒地、左眼流血、十數警察前來鎮壓、尚未能解圍、直至該校教員至始將學生訓斥而回、該受傷學生傷勢非輕、名劉人豪、即由其他同學代雇汽車送回學校、據調查歐打原因、係在觀球時有所口角、散塲後遂加執復、按市體學生每次在塲觀球、常有不守秩序、怪聲叫啞之舉動、為其他觀眾所壓惡、昨復以多數學生用武毆打、市校學生如此、殊令人失望也、</p>
<p>持志勝黃蜂</p>
<p>黃蜂昨戰頗有進步、持志上半時以十五比廿三敗於黃蜂、下半時黃蜂仍凶猛至凡、曾以廿九比十九佔優勝之勢、惜最後長力不繼、被持志追上、惟表演殊精采、</p>
<p>復旦勝辛隊</p>
<p>辛隊復旦之賽戰來、頗為沉悶、辛隊球運不佳、始終未克上風、李震中個人僅得四分、於此可知、且聯絡方面亦感缺乏也、反觀復旦則聲勢甚盛、遠擲必中、周達雲獨得廿二之多、辛隊之敗敗於此人也、</p>
<p>陸鐘恩雙手托球、首開紀錄後、周遠雲即連中三元、辛隊叫停、而周達雲陳宗祺又連連告中、十比二遙遙佔先、辛隊再叫停、賴周達雲犯規、陳祥龍兩罰增分、旋又中的、李震中妙傳、馮念華得功、八比十漸打破沉悶局面、復旦叫停、周達雲丘廣實又連連告中、一氣造成廿一比八、辛隊孫寶慶陳祥龍建功後、傳祥瑞翁仁安又各得一球、上半時、復旦廿五比十二佔勝、下半時翁仁安先進一球、馮念華扳回後、周達雲丘廣實陳宗祺各建一功、陳祥龍擲罰俱中、而翁仁安再度告捷、卅六比十六、相距更遠、此後馮念華力圖振作、李震中初開血手、而復旦諸將威風不减、愈战愈勇、結果以五十比廿九獲勝、</p>
<h3>小座談</h3>
<p>— 槐青</p>
<p>關於黃伯長與查瑞龍的一席话</p>
<p>日期：新年中某天的下午</p>
<p>地點：南京路××茶室</p>
<p>人物：甲乙丙丁（代表在座的四位，姓名恕不宣布。）</p>
<p>新年中友人约叙於××茶室，恣意畅谈，聊以點綴年景。尤以各人志同道合，話鋒漸漸轉入“老本行”的體育，而最近風行海上的新興玩意的摔角，成為談話的中心，各人的話頭上不時的溜出“黃伯長”三字，更因此又連想到新近被全國體協會准許恢復业餘資格的查瑞龍，引出一篇職業運動與業餘運動的大道理來。</p>
<p>丁：黃伯長的摔角，聽說很好，究竟怎樣，幾時我倒也很想去見識見識。</p>
<p>乙：看是值得一看，但終不免帶有“野人頭”氣味。黃伯長的技術，固然應值得佩服；可是這許多印度人的氣力都比他大，尤其是彌哈辛，我不相信都會打不過黃。</p>
<p>丙：說是假亦可以，說是真亦可以，競爭確實非常刺激動人；不過就是賣藝的氣分太濃厚了些。職業運動，尤其是這類拳鬥摔角，目的在噱頭，只要能引起觀眾的興趣，怎樣可以多賽幾㙏，多吸收門票。黃伯長沒有來上海以前，也有這些玩藝，可是沒有人，注意，所以比賽也只每月一二次而已，更因為是沒有中國人啊。黃伯長因為是中國人，更以中國從來沒有發現這樣的人材，當然值得大家一捧，要去見識見識，因此生意大盛，便每星期舉行一次，印度人只要錢，輸了有什麼關係，若與別人比賽，就是贏了還拆不到現在輸了的一半多的錢。</p>
<p>甲：上海人只要有新玩意，有噱頭，門票三元四元，不在乎。可是話得說回來，黃伯長再比幾次，即使再勝，也不見得再有許多人去看了。多看總要膩的，何况其中免不了有种“生意经”在作祟呢！我倒希望他們能够来一次“真刀真枪”，可是即使是“真刀真枪”，还有谁能相信呢？</p>
<p>乙：全国體育協進會最近董事會議決，准許查瑞龍恢復業餘資格，我想這事即使與業餘規則不抵觸，究又有什麼意思。何况一個專門賣藝的人，是否可以恢復業餘資格，還是問題。當真要為羅致人材的話，黃伯長不是更好嗎？</p>
<p>甲：黃伯長要是本人願意放棄職業的摔角，因為有例可援，一定也可以恢復業餘資格。我可保險，世界運動會的重量級摔角錦旗，黃伯長穩得無疑。全國體協會若真要拽羅如查瑞龍這樣的人材，為什麼不設法提拔黃伯長呢？黃確是特等人材呀！</p>
<p>丙：黃伯長嗎，你叫他人業餘，他可准否肯；現在他每月一二千元的收入，豈不舒服？要是他變了業餘運動員，那末他怎樣生活；即使生活不怕沒有辦法，還有這樣舒服自由嗎？要是我做了黃伯長，我就准不肯。人生究竟為的什麼？</p>
<p>甲：一般所調職業運動員其實中國並沒有真真由運動員出身的職業運動員—要求恢復業餘，無非覺得職業沒有生路，想再混入業餘，投得一個較好的出路而已。我不相信一位收入很豐富的，職業運動者，願意再回到業餘老家的末路上來。就如黃伯長他可願意嗎？這是一定的。</p>
<p>丁：聽說查瑞龍曾以“大力士”三字拍過電影，進行南洋等處專門賣過藝技，怎麼還可以恢復業餘資格？</p>
<p>丙：我想業餘運動規則，不見得會有可以准許賣藝者恢復資格的規定，否則還要業餘規則作啥？</p>
<p>甲：王文正是一個麥格，一輩子是一個麥格；可是他並不是一個賣藝者—他要不恢復業餘，决不會榮任四川某師長的秘書什麼的。究其實，還不是變相的職業運動者。因王文正的一步上青雲，所以會有類於此的事情，繼續發生。而這些運動員的精神，就也往往不能美滿。</p>
<p>乙：黃伯長那天對彌哈辛的第二次比賽；黃有兩次對裁判員很不客氣，這實在不應該。</p>
<p>丁：老滕那天在報上罵得很厲害。</p>
<p>丙：其實這有關什麼運動道德，這都是噱頭，叫你相信這比賽是這樣緊張猛烈，而絕不會疑心有什麼假的了啦！老滕雖然罵得高明，可是以“運動道德”四字去責備他，我可不佩服。</p>
<p>甲：中國的運動員現在正走着兩條路，㊀沒有生路的職業運動者，想投入業餘，另謀出路。㊁有名的業餘人員，掮着“業餘”兩字做幌子，有機會時儘量施行職業者的技倆。還有領着隊伍出國比賽，分拆比賽門票，都已成為公開的秘密。總而言之，職業運動在中國沒有生路，因為整個的體育事業的程度還差得太遠，故不得不利用“業餘”兩字的招牌，營私狗苟。其情形適與外國相反。這也就是中國體育畸形發展的象徵。</p>

<h3>程嬰與公孫杵臼</h3>
<p>— 畢毅</p>
<p>—“大丈夫要死得其所，白白的死有什麼用呢？”程嬰説。</p>
<p>晋文公做公子的時候，被迫出国漂流了十九年，全靠隨從诸臣的力量，得以反国做霸主。文公選從臣中才智最出眾，功勞最大的趙衰做國相，對他做原大夫。趙衰是一個最仁慈不過的人，真是愛民如子’，‘視民如傷’，因此晉國的人民都非常喜歡他，說他像冬天的太陽一樣的可愛。</p>
<p>趙衰的家住在原城，趙衰有空的時候，常常喜歡穿着平民的服裝，獨自一個人走到鄉村去打聽誰有困難，他好去帮助誰。有一天，他又出去打聽，看見他的百姓都安居樂業，並未有什麼疾苦的人需要他帮助的，他很高興，一路和道上遇着的農夫牧童談笑回來，因此躭誤了些光陰，到了掌燈的時候，還未到家。當着一縷一縷的炊烟消逝盡了，夕陽也忽然不見，趙衰一個人飄着幾根白鬍子，在蒼茫中獨行踽踽，未免覺得有些寂寞了。他想着他的和樂可愛的家庭，恨不得飛回去，無如他的幾根老骨頭強不過他的意志，他想的是飛，牠們却連跑也跑不來，拖着他慢慢的走</p>
<p>他的一生，越老的造就越大，他寶貴經驗，所以他從來不覺得老是可悲的。現在他因為走得不起勁，開始討厭老了，他用舌頭舐着他幾個還未脫去的牙齒嘆道：‘七十歲的老人，餘生有幾！’他忽然又轉念道，‘管他餘生有幾，好好地過日子就得啦，沒用的人，即使長到一千歲，有什麼用處；有用的人，幾十年也夠受用了。此後我一方面盡量利用我的精力去服務國家，一方面提拔後進來繼續我的軍業。</p>
<p>他剛好想到些計劃，忽然給一陣哭聲把思潮打斷了，他向農家借了一個火把，跟着哭聲在樹林裹找到一個剛要上吊的孩子。趙衰看見這樣情形，馬上悲惻惶恐起來，顫着手兒提起火把照照這孩子的臉兒，一時說不出話來，心裹想道：‘我一向以為我治國是有相當成效的，想不到這樣糟——在我的治下，孩子也不愛生存了！這孩子，身子小小，臉兒嫩嫩的，猜他的年齡－定比朔孫（朔是衰的長孫，盾的兒子）還少。’於是趙衰把火把放在地下，摟着這孩子安慰道：‘我的寶貝，不要害怕，萬事有我呢。我是趙爺爺（原邑的人都稱趙衰做趙爺爺，說起趙爺爺，誰都知道是他），你有什麽委曲告訴我罢！’这孩子一聽見是趙爺爺，像遇着什麼親人一樣，馬上倒在他的懷裹，嗚嗚的哭起來。此時地上的火把已經燒盡，只剩得一堆還在發亮的紅炭屑，晚風穿林過來，四圍都是寒氣，趙衰怕這孩子着凉，更緊緊的抱着他，拿自己的袖子替他擦淚，等他的哭聲停止才問他道：‘你今年多大？’這孩子答道，‘十六歲了。’趙衰很奇怪他未有趙朔高大，反比趙朔長了二歲，說，‘哦！你原來還是我朔孫的哥哥。’趙衰跟着問及他的姓名里居，和尋死的緣故。</p>
<p>原來這孩子，姓程叫做嬰，住在離趙家不遠。他十四歲那年，不幸父母雙雙死去了，剩下一個未滿週歲的妹妹，家窮請不起奶媽，全靠程嬰一個人，含漿灌乳來養育她。程嬰受了許多辛苦，才把妹妹養到會離懷學走了。不想有一天，程嬰有事，疏於看守，妹妹扶牆走出街上，從一個很高的斜坡摔下來。等到程嬰發覺，妹妹已經死了。程嬰認為是他自己的罪過，所以要自殺殉妹。趙衰看見他小小年紀，這樣義氣，非常喜歡他，說了許多慰勉他的話，把他勸止了</p>
<p>那時趙衰的家人，看見夜深還不見趙衰回來，非常掛心，點了幾隊人馬，分頭去找，恰好在樹林裹找着趙衰的是趙盾，趙衰因此把程嬰交給他，吩附他要當兒子一樣的看待程嬰。</p>
<p>程嬰到了趙家不久，趙衰便死了。晉襄公（文公的兒子）因為趙盾賢明，委他繼他的父親執國政。趙盾的心腸也是像趙衰一樣的仁慈，不過外表比較嚴肅些，令人不敢隨便和他親近，所以當時的人說他像夏天的太陽一樣的可怕。趙盾做了國相第二年，襄公死，太子即位，是為靈公。那時靈公還是一個小孩，一切事情，都賴趙盾主持。後來靈公長大，一天一天的殘暴無道，甚至熊掌煮不熟，也要殺死一個廚子。趙盾少不得要常來規諫，靈公不高興和奸臣屠岸賈陰謀暗殺趙盾。謀殺雖然不成功，但趙盾却被迫走了。不想趙盾走到半路，還未出晋國的疆界，晋國朝裹忽然起革命，趙盾有一個同族，叫做穿的把靈公殺了。趙盾怕朝裹無人，亂事越鬧越大，只得趕回來，立襄公的弟成公做晋君。成公仍讓趙盾做國根，並且把自己一個姊姊下嫁給趙朔做媳婦。到了景公（成公子）即位，趙盾已經身相四君，年高德重，朝野仰為人望，誰都以為能出趙氏門下是一件最榮耀的事，因此四方賓客不遠千里而來。趙盾擇賢收容，人數也很可觀了。</p>
<p>那一羣太平賓客，日長無事時，除了讀書擊劍，飲酒投壺之外，喜歡三五成羣，促膝談心，議論人好壤。賓客之中，有一位公孫杵臼，是大家所公認的模範英雄。他的體格長得非常健美，柔腸俠骨，明眼細心，最善於和人排難解紛。他的性情爽直而誠懇，又會說話，並且言出必信，從來不會畏難卸責的，因此他在趙家是一個最得人心的人。至於程嬰，他一到趙家，便跟趙朔一塊讀書過活，和趙家親屬弄得很熟。他在趙盾心目中，說他是客人，不如說是子弟。趙盾常常大宴賓客，末座總是程嬰，首座總是公孫杵臼。趙盾這樣幹，以為‘親親’‘尊賢’兩得其所，不想一般淺見的人，誤會了趙盾的好意，認為趙盾重視公孫杵臼而輕視程嬰，弄到大家都不以禮貌對待程嬰，專愛說他閒話。程嬰長得很瘦小，體弱聲低，態度很像女人。有些輕薄的人，曉得他小時也曾帶過妹妹暗裹稱他做程媽媽。程嬰這個人實在和他的外表不相稱，他志大量寬，從來不愛和人計較，只有聽見人家叫他做程媽媽，使他想着妹死之痛，才覺着難受。可是他的無抵抗的難受表示，不但不能止謗，反更加招辱。他本來是一個聰明的人，但因為他不愛表白自己，同時人家也惑於他的外表，不肯去費力認識他，結果誰都誤會他了。幾百賓客裹，只有公孫杵臼一個人曉得程嬰不平常，肯另眼相看他。最初公孫杵臼是抱着好打不平的態度，可憐程嬰孤立受欺，特地折節下交和他親近的。不料公孫杵臼一和他相識，發覺他是一位義士，反自嘆不如了。此後公孫杵臼常常替程嬰解嘲，說他的好話，無如大家已有成見，很少人相信程嬰有什麼好處</p>
<p>景公二年，趙盾死，兒子朔襲職。此時屠岸賈又有寵於景公，景公用他做司寇之官。屠岸賈因為於靈公時謀殺趙盾不遂，常引以為恨。現在他得志，便想害趙氏一家來報宿怨，於是他背着景公和趙朔，召集諸大夫，當着眾人的面前，假意痛哭道：‘靈公死得好苦呀！我們怎好不替他伸冤呢？雖然殺靈公的是趙穿，其實是趙盾主使的。趙盾以臣殺君，子孫反在朝做大官，怎能懲罪服人，請誅趙朔罷！’諸大夫明知屠岸賈誣人，但怕他的威勢，不敢起來說一句公道話。其中有－位賢大夫姓韓叫做厥，他是賴趙盾提拔出來的，怕人說他因為感恩而偏趙氏，本來避嫌不願發言，但看見大家都這樣瑟瑟縮縮避難怕事，他只得起來抗議道：‘靈公遇賊時，趙盾在外，先君以為無罪，故此不誅趙盾。今兒諸君要誅他的後人，並非先君之意。瞞着君主，妄誅好人，是亂臣賊子的事，亂臣賊子，國有常刑，請諸位當心才好。’屠岸賈曉得韓厥孤掌難嗚，不聽他的話。韓厥只得跑到趙家那裹告訴趙朔道：‘屠岸賈立心謀害您，您快走避罷！’趙朔從小在賢明父親保護之下您過慣安樂日子，不懂得達權應變，想了半天才答道：‘朔受國厚恩，實在不忍出走從前靈公要殺我父親，我父親不肯死，逃走去了，結果得到一個弒君的惡名，直到今日還有人要借這個惡名來誅他的後嗣。現在如果我還走我父親那一條路，難保我不會又得一個惡名呢？死便死罷，才趙朔决定不走避，也不反抗。’過了一會，趙朔流着眼泪對韓厥說道：‘如果您能够使趙氏不絕，我死也不恨。’韓厥答應了他，回來便托病告假不出來。</p>
<p>公孫杵臼聽見屠岸賈要害趙氏的消息，哭勸趙朔準備，趙朔不聽。程嬰知道趙朔是沒有希望的，不和他說話，只勸趙朔的夫人躱避去，因為她是宮主，到了宮裹，屠岸賈一定不敢殺害她。此時夫人已經有了身孕，她為着替趙氏保留一個後裔，只得逃到宮裹依成公夫人去。趙氏的賓客和家臣，限見趙氏大禍快臨，都怕惹到自己身上，不上一日便紛紛逃避一空了。第二天，屠岸賈親自帶兵來圍攻趙氏於下宮，把趙氏全族都殺死了。事後，岸賈查點各屍，發覺少了宮主那一具，知道她入宮躱避了，礙着成公夫人的驗子，不敢追捕，只暗中使人監視她。因為岸賈也知道宮主有了遺腹，生怕留下復仇的禍根，打算孩子一生下來，便把他撲殺了。</p>
<p>自從趙氏慘案發生後，公孫杵臼便躱起來，暗裹設法復仇。他以為程嬰一定已經殉難了，正在嘆息他死得太早，少了一個好帮手，不想就在這個時候，程嬰找着他來了。兩人相見，痛哭失聲。過了－會，公孫杵臼收淚問程嬰道：‘我以為你已經死於下宮之難了，幹嗎你不死呢？’程嬰答道：‘大丈夫要死得其所，白白的死有什麼用呢？我知道你現在設法復仇，但我以為單單復仇，不算，為趙氏做了什麼。屠岸賈主要的目的是使趙氏絕後，我們一定要使趙氏有後，讓趙氏的後人自己復仇才算做了一件恩仇兩報的正經事，現在朔的媳婦有了遺腹，在宮裹躱着。如果將來徼倖生一個好孩子，我們的計劃便可實現了。將來需要我們的事正多，何必急於一死。’公孫杵臼很贊成程嬰的高見，相約設法保全趙氏的孤兒。</p>
<p>過了兩個月，趣朔的夫人在宮裹生下一個很健好的男孩子，她鑒於趙朔柔弱自誤，特地替孩子取一個名字叫做武，她又怕屠岸賈使人謀害他，把他藏起來養，假說他一生下來便死了。岸賈不相信，派許多人進宮搜索。夫人臨急，徬徨無計，忙把嬰兒藏在自己的褲襠裹，暗中轉告道：‘趙氏該絕你就哭罷；不該絕，你不要出聲！’恰好此時趙武正在熟睡，他像懂人事似的，一聲不響，得以脫險。</p>
<p>程嬰知道這件事，忙找公孫杵臼商量道：‘趙孤養在宮裹，終竟不是萬全之計。岸賈現在搜一次搜不着，將來一定再搜，怎麼辦呢，’公孫杵臼默然深想了一回，然後問程嬰道：‘立孤與死，那一件事比較困難呢，’程嬰答道：‘死容易，立孤難呢。’公孫杵臼道，‘趙氏先君待遇你好，你强為其難罷！我呢，願為其易，請先死。’二人都同意了，於是設法找－個病重將死的嬰孩來，拿錦繡的小衣服替他穿好，結公孫杵臼帶他入首陽山躲着。然後程嬰親自去找屠岸賈告密道：‘我在趙家二三十年，趙朔父子未曾有一天好待過我，我何必因為他們枉作小人，得罪署司寇呢？讓我告訴您罷，趙氏婦在宮中生下這一個男孩子，已經給公孫杵臼偷領了出來，他們現在躱在首陽山，日間就要投奔秦國去。’屠岸賈早就聽見過趙氏賓客有公孫杵臼和程嬰這樣兩個好壞不同的人，因此一聽程嬰的話便相信了。屠岸賈於是父親自帶着兵隊跟程嬰去找趙孤去，果然在山裹找着。公孫杵臼假裝着盛怒罵程嬰道：‘程嬰你真是小人！下宮之難你不能死，和我商量藏匿趙氏孤兒，現在你又賣我！你即使不能扶立趙孤，就忍心害他嗎？’公孫杵臼淚隨聲下，抱着嬰兒向屠岸賈哀求道：‘天呀！天呀！趙氏孤兒有什麼罪過，請活了他，單單杵臼罷！’屠岸賈不答應，馬上拔劍一齊殺死了杵臼和孤兒趙氏散居各處的舊賓客，聽見這個消息，都說道：我老早便知道程嬰是小人，公孫杵臼是義士，現在事實證明了！’（未完）</p>

<h3>“中國本位文化建設討論集”（上）</h3>
<p>— 英夫</p>
<p>文化建設月刊社出版的中國本位文化建設討論集，可說是一部極有意義和價值的書籍。全集所討論的對象，是怎樣來建設中國的文化；分為兩派來討論上面的問題，即是：‘為‘中國本位’派，’為‘全盤西化’，或反‘中國本位’派。像這種以中國文化建設這個重大問題為討論對象的書籍，在我國學衛界，思想界，和出版界，真可稱為創舉。現在我們以讀者的資格，從編輯和內容兩方面來談談這一部討論集吧。</p>
<p>中國本位文化建設討論集編輯的源起，據編輯者樊仲雲在序言裹所說，是由於民國二十四年一月十日，上海十教授所發表的中國本位的文化建設宣言，所引起的討論文章，再由文化建設月刊社從百餘萬字的文章，‘擇其能自有主張系統井然者，都三十萬言’，編輯而成的。於此可見：這部討論集，是上述重大問題討論文章的精華。至於這部書的編輯方法呢，我們可以在下面談談。</p>
<p>全書連編者序言在內，共計時論文字四十九篇。在排列的次序上來說，由編輯者把那些文章分為九類：第一，中國本位的文化建設宜言；第二，何謂文化；第三，何謂中國本位；第四，中國本位與不守舊；第五，中國本位與不盲從；第六，中國本位與中體西用；第七，怎樣建設中國本位的文化；第八，總答復及其批評；第九，西化世界化與中國本位。凡是關於中國本位文化建設的問題，不論重要次要，直接間接，都可以從這部討論集裹找到。這不能不歸功於編輯法的適合和完美。</p>
<p>接着，讓我們從四十九篇討論文章中，提出三篇以作全集內容的代表，加以概要的介紹和考察吧。如：集首陳立夫的文化與中國文化之建設，可說是一篇重要的文章，為全集討論文章的基礎。陳氏在篇首，說明了文，文明，文化的意義；並且，詳細的解釋着：所謂文化，須經過七個顯明的階段，即中庸所謂‘誠則形，形則著，著則明，明則動，動則變，變則化。’接着，他引用中山先生所說的，‘古今人類所以要有不斷的努力，就是因為要求生存，人類因為要有不間斷的生存，所以社會纔有不停止的進化，’這句話，以證實，擴充上述文化的意義。並且，連帶的說明了：中國國民黨的調政，便是文明建設的工作，更進一步，他又指示了中國本位文化建設的內容和方法。（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>隔壁阿二不偷鷄</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>要看報紙上要人偉人的名諭，或是外國要人偉人發表的文字，總不要從正面去看，須要從侧面旁面後面去作種種推敲，方才有些意義，方才能明白其究竟，否則不免上了他們的大當，這種說話，是他們故意欺人麼。不是，絕對不是。我可原諒，是他們的一種政治作用。</p>
<p>雖然這種政治作用，是大家見得到的，大家猜得着的，但是他們不能不發表一種無價值的妙論，自屬別有苦衷，別有作用，若說這種文字，完全無價值麼？天然此種文字有相當的價值，不然，犯不着再去敝敝唇焦，作無謂的呻吟信不信由人，說不說由我，所以我說這是與‘隔壁阿二不偷雞’的聲明一樣</p>
<p>即如某國對於我國，口口聲聲‘中×親善一，口口聲聲‘共存共榮’，這種好聽的名詞，說得震天價響，試問果然欲共存共榮麼？中×親善麼？且看他們親善的態度怎樣？共存的方法又是怎樣？我們便可知道他們是狙公弄狙的手段，完全是靠不住的。</p>
<p>東京五日電，日本有田八郎，屬於日德防共協定，引起種種誤會，特於五日下午，由無线電播音演講防共協定的國際意義，是‘專誠拜謁，不作別用的，’請英美兩國，胆大放心，不必多所疑懼，但是這種聲明，試問英美兩國，能否相信，能不懷疑，我想英美兩國的人士决不若是其態大乎？但是信不信由他，說不說由我。</p>
<p>並且聽了他們的言論，又要默察現在的時機，日德防共協定，業已訂立多時，當時且拿這種協定，有誇耀一世之概，何以到現在忽地裹來一個播音演講，解釋意義，天然耶穌自有道理，一定有一個相當的作用。</p>
<p>然則此種道理，從那一處看出呢？講讀者觀察國際間的形勢，和我國的形勢，又彼自己國內的形勢，則此種聲明，自有道理存焉。我可不必細說。</p>
<h3>在滿洲</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<p>一個從滿洲帶來的故事</p>
<p>我的朋友重新呷了一口茶，沉默了一會，就說着：</p>
<p>“你們沒有到過瀋陽時，大概不曉得萬泉河吧！這真是一個好去處。一到夏天，柳條兒抹着清澈的水面，風景好極了，玩的人可真多。從日本來的馬戲團，也在那里搭起棚來，還有咱們山東人臨時搭的賣藝團，損絞的，比武的，什麼都有，也有北平來的姑娘們唱着落子戲，本地的野檯戲，那喇叭聲，鑼鼓聲，人聲，半里開外都聽得見。整個萬泉河鬧熱得像一個剛開了的湯鍋。</p>
<p>三年前，我從長春他們有的呌‘新京’但我們總呌長春這老名字，到瀋陽來，拜望幾個老鄉，想找個活兒。這只是說說罷了，當真找起來可不容易。我就馬馬虎虎住在一個朋友家里。他是一個在什麼中學里當教員，一個滿爽快慷慨的人，我一到，他就說：‘老黃，這年頭找活不容易，權住下去再講吧’。就這樣，我就住到那一年的夏天。</p>
<p>可是，瀋陽這地方，實在比不上從前，翻天覆地的事情多得很。有一天，城里女中里有幾個學生到萬泉河逛兒，給幾個留着仁丹鬍子的人看上了，這些人是威福慣的，恣肆慣的，跟了跟，跟了跟，跟到半路，有一個壓不住性，竟走上前去在一個人的臉上擰了一把。這麼着，那些姑娘們就跑起來，邊哭邊喊：‘救命呀！救命呀！’好了，半路碰見幾個‘紅袖頭’，紅袖頭就是所謂‘滿洲國’的兵士啦，她們見到他們，就嚷着：</p>
<p>‘你們是中國人，救救我們吧！’</p>
<p>那時候，那些留仁丹鬍子的人心里樂得開花了，顧不了體面莊嚴，從後面跟了上來。</p>
<p>那幾個红袖頭也是有骨氣的，看見這樣子，就一骨碌地搶上前，把那些追着的人們攔住了，有仁丹鬍子的人那裹肯讓，大家就打了起來，事情就這樣鬧大了啦</p>
<p>過了幾天，萬泉河就出了亂子了，</p>
<h3>冬夜</h3>
<p>— 魏清歌</p>
<p>已經是半夜的時候了，他還是反來覆去的，不能入夢，他聽見外面的北風，呼呼地吹着，他心裹真有點煩亂啊！但是他看見他身邊睡的蘭菌，却睡得是那樣舒適的，於是他心裹又羨慕着了。</p>
<p>‘我們睡在一個地方，為甚你能安眠我却不能安眠呢？’清晨起來的時候，他問蘭菌。</p>
<p>‘因為我每晚臨睡的時候，總用熱水洗腳，血液下注，就能安眠。不過我在水中還放着‘亞林沙而’藥水，能夠止癢祛濕，免染腳癬。並且……蘭菌说到这裹，她的聲音低了，她附在他的耳邊說：‘並且我每晚洗滌身體，也用‘亞林沙而’消毒，免得細菌傳染，釀成白帶和子宮病呢。一（亞林沙而，五洲出品。）</p>
<h3>病痛世界</h3>
<p>— 蔣慈</p>
<p>現在的人們，差不多都由着病痛，有的人一身兼由着幾種病，有些人最少也患着一種病，所以现在的世界實在可說是一個病痛的世界。</p>
<p>這些患病的人們，嘗受着疾病的痛苦，他們誰個不希望早痊呢：祇是得不到適當的治療，或者服用沒有效力的藥劑，於是他們的病痛便延長下去了。</p>
<p>然則真的就沒有解除病痛的藥劑嗎？不，有效力的藥劑，就要到有信用的藥房裹去買，像五洲大藥房，製出的各種成藥，都是非常靈驗，得到社會的信用，因為五洲的製劑是一亳不茍的。並且五洲又在總店大樓內，設立各科診断；主診的都是海上最著名的醫師，這又是便利病家的一種了。</p>

<p>有幾十個紅袖頭，把十二個‘仁丹’的打死了。這事情鬧得滿城風雨，你們要曉得，紅袖頭吃的是誰的餉？他們的排長，教官都是有着‘仁丹’鬍子的，要幹這事情可真不容易。你們說，這些人戇不戇？你能說他們忘了自己是中國人麼？</p>
<p>但是，還有着更驚人的事情呢。出事的那一天，大街小巷全戒嚴了，飛機在天上不斷地軋軋的響。我們的老鄉，那位張先生，他坐着汽車回來了，這人坐汽車，大概是第一趟，我想。他慌里慌張地跑進房間來，第一句就問我：</p>
<p>‘老黃，你還有什麼朋友在瀋陽麼？”</p>
<p>這真是丈八金剛，呌人摸不着頭腦。我看了看他，知道一定有什麼岔子，就說：</p>
<p>“朋友是有的，倒不是深交，有什麼事？”</p>
<p>‘我想你今夜還是到朋友家里歇歇吧，有別的朋友要到我這里來，人很多，實在對不起，真是，………不過，也許我要搬家……’</p>
<p>他動手收拾東西，真是慌亂得很。我站在那兒，想不出辦法來。突然，有人上來了，雨衣（外面下着大雨啦）抹着墻壁沙沙的響。來的人跑到我們的房門口，用手猛扣着門一邊說着：</p>
<p>‘張先生在家麽？’</p>
<p>他不待回話，就扯開門來。你猜是誰？是警察！</p>
<p>我們的張先生兩手按着桌子，面色慘白，一句話也沒說。</p>
<p>‘你是張先生麼？我希望你在晚上十一點鐘以前離開這地方，這是我好意的勸告，遲則不及的。’這位警察先生看了看，頭也不回就想走了。</p>
<p>‘喂，朋友，你是不是說有人要：……’</p>
<p>是的，他們已計劃好了。望你趕緊，我是中國人，我有良心，所以我冒險跑到這里來告訴你一聲。再見。’</p>
<p>他走了，張先生的眼淚不自主地連串地弔下來。我好像掉入五里霧中，覺得所有都太神秘了。</p>
<p>我憑着窗望下去，那個送訊的人正冒着雨走出去。</p>
<p>隔天，我們讀報，才知道那些‘仁丹的’要拿我們的張先生，說張先生是同紅袖頭串通，專幹反正的事情的。他們說‘正犯在逃’。</p>
<p>那個人的影像現在還深深刻在我的腦里。你們想，世上有血性，有骨氣，有良心的人不是還多着麼？你看他們穿那套一見就要作嘔的制服，以為他連靈魂都出賣去，不，不，聽了我這故事你就明白了。</p>
<p>‘我們那張先生自那一回之後就離開瀋陽，沒通過信，上幾時由哈爾濱來的朋友們，說他已經死了。真可惜！中國要有這樣的人，總有翻身的一天吧！’</p>
<p>我的朋友，嘆了口氣，用着火一樣的眼睛望着我們。</p>
<h3>病中</h3>
<p>— 李雯</p>
<p>已经幾天没有見到太阳，聽見寒鴉在後園的白柏樹上吵呌着，才知道又是一天落黑了。生病人多感觸，是沒有方法可以解除的，平常未見得把‘光陰如箭’作為金科五律，一件瑣細的工作總要因循幾天才肯動手：而一生了病，在病榻上的日子就覺過得太快了。聽見寒鴉的聲音，我又屈指計算着我病了幾天病了。其實也並不是忽然賓貴起光險來，實在是躺在病榻上太寂寞了；生的又不是重病，神智是很清楚的，於是平常所堆積着的工作，現在都想如何去清理它，還有病後想做一點什麼事情，也都计劃好了，這樣，自然感得日子過去得太快。</p>
<p>病中又好發奇想，聽覺又分外靈敏，家人們在隔屋子談論什麼事，祇要聽到一片一段，我就會從此推想下去，希望能發現一件秘神的事。雖然他們明白地告訴我，他們在談着某一件事，或某一個人；而這件事這個人是與我一點關係也沒有的。但是還以為有一部份事物一定瞞秘着我，努力從親密的地方推想下去，結果由自己組成了一段童話似的結論，到那時侯才啞然失笑，知道自己太神經過敏了。</p>
<p>病中最多的念頭是想到死。第一天不能起床，我就想到我這個病要不要立刻死去。平時我是個不怕死的人，把什麼事都看得很平淡，而且常常嘈笑自殺的人，要死就讓它死去，何苦用自己的手來結束自己的生命呢？這幾天却常被死纏繞着我，彷彿一根繩索那樣不能解脫。</p>
<p>由於死，當然也會想到鬼。有一夜熱度最高的時候，我竟是不敢合眼，一合眼，彷彿就有許多憧憧往來的鬼影在我的床前徘徊。母親和孩子都坐在我的床前，她們或許聽了我的藝語而担憂着吧！但是我很清楚，我彷彿要她們去睡，她們為了我的病，已經太辛苦了，這些心中的話，是否說出了口，到現在還不知道，因為找怕打破寂寞的氣氛。在晚上，我很怕有聲音，而最怕的是兩個人的耳語。她們低聲的談話，我會想到她們在談論我的病或者已到了不可救藥的地步了，而風吹着紙窗，或者老鼠在牆角落裹走動，那種輕微的聲音發現時，我馬上把閉着的眼睛張開來，我怕鬼，（雖然我是不信神鬼的）據說鬼都是那樣幽幽然地出現的。這情形或許是我個人如此。</p>
<p>幸虧熱度在第二天就退下了，否則，疑神疑鬼，我害怕我會變成神經衰弱症的。</p>
<p>現在一切如常了，祇是身體太疲乏，還要幾天休養罷。不過我又賓貴‘光陰如箭’了，在病榻上許多天光陰，我不是可以做多少工作嗎？</p>
<p>又是一天了，房裹已亮了電燈。</p>

<p>。爲什麽，近來行動多偏執。因甚的，姨母跟前禮數週。笑鶯兒巧結梅花絡。要籠絡得，郎心把别個丢。自古道，姨表不如姑表近。這禍根苗，總是鳯丫頭。我爲你。淚暗流。我爲你。别時牽掛見時羞。指望終身咏好逑。縱有那，香閨姊妹聯吟社。那怕，海棠春到菊花秋。怎解得我，心中無限愁。驀然間片語機關漏。始識得他們暗地謀。細思量真個没來由。一個是，參天拜祖稱和合。一個是，瀟湘風雨竹颼颼。把新詩舊帕都焚去。斷送如花命不由。女兒身。幻夢醒紅樓。</p>

<h3>畢業卽失業</h3>
<p>生命是可貴的，誰愿意輕易的把它送掉，尤其是一個受有高等教育，有着前途的青年。但是生活終究是一條無情的皮鞭，在它的襲擊與壓迫之下，在無可奈何裹，有許多有用的人們，是向着這末路—自殺—走的，他們甘願這樣做嗎？不，决不是，整個殘酷的社會環境逼着的。</p>
<p>伊明—‘十字街頭’的青年小徐—他為着要獲得維持生活的工具，為着改善人類社會，他帶着一颗向上的善良的心，經歷了層層的困危，艱苦地在××大學裹研讀，四年的奮鬥，終於畢業了，在當時，他的確慶賀着自己的幸運的。但是方帽子，文憑，在目前矛盾的中國社會，又值得幾個錢，有的只是讽刺，譏笑，他美滿的憧憬撲空了，這夢給現實的社會打碎了，在畢業以後，他就開始着失業了。</p>
<p>生活是更艱困了，失業的苦悶，加以病魔的侵襲，遙遠的故鄉，老母的期望，未來的黯淡，他只有偷偷地心酸，流淚。</p>
<p>某一天的暮色蒼茫裹，他—伊明—獨自倚着黄浦江邊的路燈，灰暗的夜色籠罩着，聲聲的江水打着岸邊。他失望憂鬱地呆立着，這社會是沒有他容身之地了，經過再三的思索，他感覺到只有自殺，向遼闊的黄浦江裹葬送自己。</p>
<p>用急速的步調衝去，在非常危急的關頭，趙丹，這一樣是失業的青年，他看到了，不顧一切的把他在死亡线上拖住，用熱烈的安慰勸導他：</p>
<p>“朋友！你自殺了這社會因此改善嗎”？</p>
<p>於是這兩個可憐的同伴，在沈西苓的導演指揮之下，重復回到明星二廠去了。</p>
<h3>“雷雨”本事</h3>
<p>原著者：奧斯得洛天斯基</p>
<p>導演：章泯</p>
<p>在一個舊式的家庭裹，有個凶惡而冷酷的母親卡彭諾瓦，對於她的兒子奇虹和女兒瓦爾瓦拉都很嚴厲，對兒媳婦卡答林尤其厲害得不近人情。那活躍的女兒，忍受不了，後來同着她的情人庫得略慈逃跑了，就是那懦弱的兒子也難以忍受，終於找到了生活跑出去了。</p>
<p>那兒媳婦卡答林，受盡婆婆的虐待，同時丈夫又只知喝酒解悶，不去給她一點安慰；她在這樣冷酷的家庭中，簡直毫無生趣，然她又不是個懦庸的女子，甘於這樣苟且偷生。正在這樣苦惱之中，她偶然傾心一個青年叫鮑里司，那個青年正受他叔父　闊意折磨，非常苦悶，一見卡答林，也非常傾心。彼此都滿以為可以互相安慰，感到點生趣；卡答林同時又覺得她是有夫之婦，不應再愛別人，但是那種殘忍冷酷的家却又不能忍受。她就在這樣兩夜之中痛苦了極點！</p>
<p>她忍不住，終於向婆婆丈夫懺悔，好使她的痛苦减輕點；可是婆婆一聽見那樣的事情，就更加對卡答林厲害了，逼得她在家裹简直無法容身！卡答林無可奈何，只得去求救於鮑里司；可是鮑里司正被他叔父派到別處去做事情，未敢答應卡答林的請求，就別了卡答林各自去了。可憐的卡答林，這時‘有家歸不得’，在外又無處安身，終於在那茫茫的黑夜裹投到伏爾加河永久安息去了！</p>

<p>The Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters is hereby abolished. This order.

They have now telegraphed to plead guilty and should be dismissed from their posts as a warning. However, considering that the banditry in Shaanxi and Gansu is not yet quelled and that administrative matters need to be addressed, and that these officials have served with distinction for many years, they are temporarily allowed to remain in their original posts, each separately overseeing their subordinates to do their utmost to pacify the region and redeem their past mistakes. This order. Gu Zhutong is specially appointed as Director of the Xi'an Branch of the Military Affairs Commission. This order. Shao Lizi, member and chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, requests to resign. Shao Lizi is granted permission to relinquish all his posts. This order.

<p>[Nanjing] Various groups in Nanjing issued a circular telegram on the 6th, supporting the Central Government's measures for the aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident, urging the whole country to support them. The original telegram stated that, fortunately, the Central Government had calmly planned and taken appropriate measures in this Shaanxi Incident, turning conflict into peace and transforming malice into harmony.

The Executive Yuan has also discussed and decided on measures for the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu, and Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong have been generously dismissed and allowed to remain in their posts. Other military and political officials and subordinates have not been held accountable. Overall, the Central Government's measures for the aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident are based on generosity. Zhang Xueliang, having received this exceptional treatment, should strive to improve himself and become a pillar of the nation, ready to be selected for important tasks. Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and all the Northeast Army officers and soldiers should be grateful for the Central Government's utmost care, recognize that military force is the force of the people and that the army is the army of the nation, break away from feudal tribalism, and obey the Central Government's deployment and training, redeeming their crimes through meritorious service and defending the borders. The people of the whole country should strengthen their mutual trust and devote their efforts to the revival of the nation. The future of the country will become brighter because of the Shaanxi Incident. The telegram urged the whole country to unanimously support the Central Government's measures for the aftermath.

<h3>How Will Sino-Japanese Relations Evolve This Year?</h3>
<p>Editorial of Tokyo Asahi Shimbun: The Failure of Past Negotiations Was Due to Insufficient Understanding; It Is Still Too Optimistic to Hope for More Gains This Year</p>
<p>[Tokyo] With the beginning of the New Year, the Sino-Japanese situation has once again attracted attention from all sides. How Sino-Japanese relations will evolve this year has become a topic of general discussion. Today's Asahi Shimbun editorial, titled "Prospects for Sino-Japanese Relations," states that the resolution of the Chengdu and Beihai incidents on New Year's Eve has reduced the tension in the Sino-Japanese situation, but it is still too optimistic to say that Sino-Japanese relations have improved due to the above facts and that more gains can be expected this year. The newspaper then points out two reasons for the failure of Sino-Japanese negotiations last year: ㊀ The Japanese assumption that it could intimidate and force China to submit has not only proven ineffective, but this viewpoint also shows that Japan has not even paid attention to the reason why China does not understand Japan. This error is due to insufficient understanding of China. ㊁ The opinion that Japan should return to normal diplomacy has instead strengthened China's position. In other words, if the goal is to adjust relations between the two countries, only issues that can be resolved through ordinary diplomatic channels should be raised for discussion, but this was not the case. This was a mistake on the Japanese side. The newspaper concludes by advocating that Japan's national policy on Sino-Japanese relations can be achieved through normal and unified diplomacy, but it must be attached to the following two conditions: ㊀ Japan should do its best to maintain satisfactory relations with the Soviet Union. ㊁ What the North China side is currently seeking is only to maintain the current situation for a certain period of time, not to make permanent plans.

<p>[Tianjin] Regarding the export of Lushun salt, the Japanese side and the Chinese company and our Lushun Feng Salt Store will continue to negotiate the contract for this year. The Japanese side intends to purchase 200,000 to 250,000 tons this year, but the Lushun and Taiwan representatives believe that the current reserves in the Changlu beaches are only 250,000 tons, so they propose that at most 100,000 tons should be ordered first, and the remaining quantity should be discussed later. Last year's price was 2.4 yuan per ton, and the beach households suffered a lot of losses. According to the contract, this year's price should also be increased, advocating a price of 3 yuan per ton, but the Japanese side not only refused to increase it but asked to reduce it to 2.1 yuan. The opinions of the two sides differ greatly, and the negotiations have reached a stalemate. The Lushun Feng Salt Store has reported the negotiation process to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council on the 6th. At the same time, the stove households also believe that even at 3 yuan per ton, there is still a risk of losses, and it is difficult to concede to a lower price.

Funds will be advanced soon. Approximately 90,000 yuan is allocated for the entire Yellow River, and half that amount for the four rivers including the North-South Canal. The Yongding River funds were originally allocated by the Economic Commission, but the Department of Construction has also decided to temporarily advance them to ensure the purchase of materials and consolidation of river works. It is scheduled to begin surveillance on the Yellow River for ice jams on February 1st. External reports suggest that the Yellow River ice floes have already passed Longmen, but river affairs personnel claim that this year's ice jams in the Hebei Yellow River are not expected to be dangerous.

<h3>The Japan-Soviet Fisheries Problem</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea, located between Japan and the Soviet Union, are among the world's three major fishing grounds. The great profits involved make them a point of contention between Japan and the Soviet Union. In recent years, Japan-Soviet diplomacy has largely focused on this fisheries issue, so some people even regard Japan-Soviet diplomacy as 'fisheries diplomacy,' and the dynamics of the fisheries issue seem to have become a barometer of Japan-Soviet diplomacy. Recently, after several twists and turns, Japan and the Soviet Union signed a protocol extending the validity of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Agreement, which expired at the end of last year, until the end of this year. The Japan-Soviet fisheries problem, which has been negotiated for years, seems to have come to a stage. And the tension in Japan-Soviet relations may therefore be eased somewhat. In fact, if we observe more closely, this assessment may not be entirely accurate.</p>
<p>The Japan-Soviet fisheries dispute has a long history. The Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905 stipulated that old Russia should conclude various agreements with Japan, ceding fishing rights along the coast of Russian territory in the Sea of Okhotsk and the Bering Sea to Japan, thus opening the Japan-Soviet fisheries dispute. In 1907, Japan and old Russia concluded a fisheries agreement based on this stipulation, defining Japan's fishing areas there. This agreement expired in 1919. At that time, although the Russian Revolution had succeeded, Japan and Russia not only did not have normal diplomatic relations but were also in a state of hostility. Japanese fishermen were no longer bound by the agreement and were free to fish. In 1922, the Soviet Union was established and its foundation was consolidated. Japan then re-concluded a temporary fisheries agreement with it, stipulating that the validity period would last until the end of 1926. In 1925, representatives of Japan and the Soviet Union concluded an agreement in Beijing to restore diplomatic relations. In the same year, representatives of the two countries held a fisheries conference in Moscow based on the provisions of this agreement. At that time, the Japanese representatives advocated using the 1907 fisheries agreement as the basis for revising the agreement, while the Soviet representatives advocated using the general development of Japan-Russia affairs after 1907 as the basis for revising the agreement, based on the provisions of Article 3 of the Beijing Agreement. However, the Japanese representatives refused to be bound by the Beijing Agreement and insisted on their own claims without yielding. Therefore, the meeting repeatedly stalled. In 1928, thanks to the Soviet Union's concession, the current fisheries agreement was established. However, this agreement did not define Japan's fishing areas but gave Japan an excuse to invade Soviet territorial waters. Therefore, since its implementation, disputes have arisen repeatedly, only increasing the tension in relations between the two countries. To this day, there are still many unresolved issues between the two countries that have arisen as a result.</p>
<p>The current agreement has a validity period of eight years and was originally scheduled to expire on May 28th of last year. Three days before the expiration date, the Soviet Union accepted Japan's request to extend the validity of this agreement until the end of last year, hoping that during this period, Japan would no longer threaten the Soviet Union, so that the tense relations between the two countries would gradually ease, and a new agreement would be produced. However, the relations between the two countries not only did not improve, but Japan's mood of threatening the Soviet Union rose even higher. In November of last year, the negotiations between the two countries had gradually approached and there was a great possibility of producing a new agreement, but Japan again concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact with Germany, threatening the Soviet Union, which added many obstacles to the production of a new agreement. However, although Japan has repeatedly threatened the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has not hesitated to make further concessions to Japan, agreeing to extend the validity period of the current agreement for another year, so that the fisheries dispute between the two countries has temporarily come to an end.</p>
<p>Based on the above, we can assert that although the current Japan-Soviet fisheries agreement has been extended for another year, if Japan does not change its attitude towards the Soviet Union, a new agreement cannot be produced, and the fisheries dispute between Japan and the Soviet Union still cannot be thoroughly resolved.</p>
<h3>The U.S. Congress Opens Amidst the Precarious European Situation</h3>
<p>Roosevelt to Issue Important Statement Today; Expanding the Neutrality Act to Be Discussed First</p>
<p>[Washington] Although the European situation is extremely turbulent, the 75th U.S. Congress opened today in a calm atmosphere. President Roosevelt is scheduled to attend the House of Representatives tomorrow to deliver a speech, explaining the policies he plans to pursue after being re-elected. The public is paying close attention to this speech, and it is believed that the President will make an important statement on the diplomatic front. Regarding the issue of prohibiting the shipment of arms to Spain, officials have confirmed that the government will submit a draft resolution to Congress tomorrow, requesting that it be put to discussion under urgent procedures. The draft resolution proposes to grant the President the power to act expeditiously, so as to extend the arms embargo to both sides of the Spanish Civil War. It is generally believed that since the government has adopted the form of a draft resolution, Congress will not strongly oppose it. (Havas dispatch, June 5)</p>
<p>[Washington] The 75th U.S. Congress convened here today. Apart from various opening ceremonies, almost all of the time was occupied by discussions on diplomatic events. Leaders of both houses of Congress will prepare a plan tomorrow to authorize the President to expand the scope of the Neutrality Act in the shortest possible time, so as to include both sides of the Spanish Civil War. It is rumored that the U.S. government is considering not only prohibiting the transport of arms to Spain, but also prohibiting transport to Germany, because the German navy is virtually in a state of war with the Spanish government. However, this rumor has not yet been confirmed. The Washington Post today published an editorial commenting on the matter, saying that the U.S. government may soon obstruct Hitler's risky actions. If the U.S. President declares that Germany and Spain are in a state of war and warns the American people not to travel on the ships of belligerent countries, the impact on German shipping will be unthinkable. It is heard that the plan currently under consideration by the United States is to find a way for Congress to pass a joint resolution as soon as possible to ban the transport of arms to Spain. The licenses previously issued for the transport of arms will also be revoked. (Reuters dispatch, June 5)</p>
<p>[Washington] The 75th U.S. Congress opened at 12:05 p.m. today in the traditional state of disarray. The Senate was slightly more solemn, while the House was even more playful. The Senate is composed of 76 Democrats, 16 Republicans, 2 Progressives, and 2 Farmer-Laborites, with Vice President Garner as Speaker. The gallery was packed at the opening. The majority leader, Robinson, then announced that the Neutrality Act would be the first item discussed in the Senate. The House of Representatives had fewer attendees at the opening. Bankhead was first elected as Speaker, followed by the approval of the Foreign Affairs Committee members, preparing to quickly pass the Emergency Neutrality Act.</p>
<p>The Senate adjourned 20 minutes after convening. The House of Representatives adjourned at 2:22 p.m. and is scheduled to hold a joint session of the House and Senate at 12:30 p.m. tomorrow to determine the number of votes for President Roosevelt's election and to listen to the President's annual message. New Deal leaders promised today not to introduce new tax bills, but the issues that Congress should address are still relevant to the entire nation. There are already more than 2,000 issues prepared for consideration. The first item submitted was a bill by Democratic Representative Ludlow, advocating that a declaration of war by the United States should be decided by a national popular vote.

<h3>U.S. State Department Issues Licenses for Arms Shipments to Spain</h3>
<p>Suddenly Orders Suspension of Loading</p>
<p>[Washington] State Department officials announced today that the department has issued 19 arms export licenses to San Francisco merchant Ting Lai, authorizing the shipment of 46 aircraft, 7,000 rifles, 1,000 light machine guns, 50 machine guns, 41.7 million rounds of ammunition, and other items to Valencia, Spain. The arms are valued at $4,507,050,000.00. The consignee is the Spanish Ambassador to Mexico, Vodas, who is coming here. Recently, Mr. Gues, manager of the Waimale Corporation, also obtained a similar passport, which has attracted national attention. Mr. Gues has now submitted his passport to the New York authorities and is loading aircraft onto ships for shipment to Spain. (National News Agency dispatch, June 5)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Spanish ship 'Maganta Bailleco', berthed in the port of Brooklyn, suddenly stopped loading aircraft and parts last night at midnight. Rumors immediately spread that the loading was suspended by order from Washington. However, the truth of the matter is still unknown. It is said that the aircraft are worth a total of 2.5 million U.S. dollars and were shipped to Spain by Mr. Kos. Mr. Kos was the first to obtain a license to export arms to Spain since the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. It is heard that the 'Maganta Bailleco' was originally scheduled to sail tonight. Mr. Kos specially hired a large number of stevedores to work overnight in order to quickly load the hundreds of boxes containing 18 aircraft and parts, hoping to ship them out before Congress had the power to prevent the goods from leaving the United States. It is said that among the aircraft Mr. Kos intends to export is one that is the 'Lady Peace', recently flown across the Atlantic by famous American aviators Haxuman and Miller. Before the Kos cargo was stopped from being loaded, the U.S. State Department also issued an arms export license to a certain arms merchant, who planned to export aircraft, rifles, machine guns, and ammunition worth 4.5 million U.S. dollars to Spain. Under the existing Neutrality Act, the U.S. State Department has no power to refuse to issue licenses. However, the U.S. government has used moral suasion to dissuade applicants from requesting licenses, and there have been several cases to date. (Reuters dispatch, June 6)</p>
<h3>Republican Members Announce Policy</h3>
<p>Seeking Constructive Progress Within the Scope of the Constitution</p>
<p>[Washington] The minority parties, the Republican Party and the Progressive Farmer-Labor Party, have each announced their policies. Republican leader Snell stated that the party's policy is to seek constructive progress within the scope of the Constitution. 'A party of opposition that is only opportunistic cannot be respected. Our responsibility is to carefully study all legislative proposals, support those that are sound, and oppose those that are hasty and incomplete through proper debate. The Democratic Party, which is in the vast majority in this Congress, must have a courageous party of opposition to debate with in order to achieve proper results,' he said. The leader of the Progressive Farmer-Labor Party said that the two major parties should deal with the issue of the Supreme Court, saying that the Court's repeated rulings invalidating important laws are hindering the interests of farmers and workers.

<h3>Issue of Chinese and Japanese Immigration Quotas</h3>
<p>Chairman of the House Committee Advocates Maintaining the Status Quo</p>
<p>[Washington] Dicusden, Chairman of the House Immigration and Naturalization Committee, stated today that he has no preconceived notions on the issue of Chinese and Japanese immigration quotas. The matter can be made into a bill, authorizing immigration officials to study the issue as a reference for revising the existing immigration law. Mr. Dicusden continued that the existing immigration law has become complicated due to timely amendments. Regarding the exclusion of the Japanese, it was proposed by California Senator Hiram Johnson and former Washington Representative Albert Johnson. They believe that the Japanese have violated the Gentleman's Agreement concluded during the tenure of former President Roosevelt. If the issue of Chinese and Japanese immigration quotas is put to discussion, it will inevitably become a question of whether they should enjoy the same treatment as other countries. It is not inappropriate to study this matter, but I am in favor of maintaining the immigration status quo. (National News Agency dispatch, June 5)</p>
<h3>商船被扣事件西政府嚴重抗議</h3>
<p>Addressing the League of Nations and the British Government, Accusing Germany of violating international law</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Spanish government in Valencia has lodged a strong protest with the League of Nations against Germany's violation of international law in carrying out naval activities within Spanish territorial waters. The origin of this protest is due to Germany repeatedly taking retaliatory measures against the Spanish government's detention of a portion of the cargo and one passenger from the German ship 'Palos'. Furthermore, the ultimatum previously presented to the Spanish government by the German naval commander in Spanish territorial waters is set to expire at 8:00 AM on Friday, thus the situation has become quite tense. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The Spanish ambassador, Usugara, recently presented a note to Foreign Secretary Eden on behalf of his country's republican government, protesting the German detention of Spanish merchant ships and the resulting violation of international law. The note stated, in essence, that German warships stationed in Spanish waters had arbitrarily detained two Spanish merchant ships, the 'Aragon' and the 'Marhuenda'. If Spanish naval and air forces stationed nearby had intervened to obstruct the actions of the German warships, a serious conflict would have inevitably ensued. If this were to occur, the non-intervention policy pursued by various countries regarding the Spanish civil war, and the efforts made by the London Non-Intervention Committee, the goal of which is to limit the scope of the Spanish civil war and prevent its escalation into an international war, would suffer an irreparable blow. The Spanish government is uncertain whether this novel situation should be submitted to the Committee for resolution and therefore requests the British government's ruling. Spanish sources here recently announced that the intelligence department of the Spanish republican government issued a bulletin on the 4th of this month, describing the German warships' detention of Spanish merchant ships and concluding that the republican government has decided to take 'various diplomatic measures'. These so-called diplomatic measures are this note. (5th, Havas)</p>
<h3>調整委員會小組開會</h3>
<p>Committee sub-group meeting</p>

<p>Monitoring plan expenses, Majority of countries agree to share costs</p>
<p>[London] The sub-committee of the Non-Intervention Agreement Committee met at 3:30 PM today, and did not mention recent developments. As for the expenses for neutral representatives to monitor the implementation of the Non-Intervention Agreement, which amount to approximately US$250,000 per month, the majority of the 27 countries participating in the Committee have agreed to share the costs. (5th, Guomin Dian)</p>
<p>[London] At yesterday's sub-committee meeting, the Romanian representative was unwilling to share the expenses required to implement the monitoring measures [other national representatives also agreed with his proposal]. (Note: The estimated cost of implementing the monitoring measures is approximately one million pounds, which should be shared by each member country.) (6th, Havas)</p>
<h3>荷公主與德親王今日大婚</h3>
<p>Dutch Princess and German Prince to be married today</p>
<p>觀禮者當有百萬餘人　荷政府特頒大赦慶祝</p>
<p>Over a million spectators expected, The Dutch government issues special amnesty to celebrate</p>
<p>The Hague The German Prince Bernhard and Dutch Princess Juliana officially hold their wedding tomorrow; a special amnesty has been issued to mark the celebration. Therefore, the mutineers of the Dutch ship 'De Zeven Provinciën', who mutinied in the Dutch East Indies in 1933, will all be pardoned. The scope of this amnesty is very broad, and 1,300 unpaid income taxpayers are also included in the amnesty. Their debts will also be forgiven. Tomorrow, thousands of people will flock to the capital to watch the wedding ceremony. It is expected that at least a million people will gather on the streets to cheer for the newlyweds. The religious ceremony will be presided over by Professor Aubynk, the court chaplain, and Dr. Walter. Many gifts have been received for this occasion, including many cars donated by the Dutch people, and a tea set presented by the Sultan of Kutei in Borneo. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<p>The Hague The wedding of Dutch Princess Juliana (the heir to the throne) and German Prince Bernhard is scheduled for next year. The wedding committee held a grand banquet last night to entertain the princess and her fiancé. No fewer than 2,000 people were invited, including members of the Dutch royal family, German princes, and the Duke of Kent, representing the British royal family. During the banquet, the orchestra played the Dutch national anthem, the Nazi Party anthem, and the British national anthem. The German nobles all performed the Nazi Party salute, while the groom, Prince Bernhard, performed a regular salute. The other guests listened silently to the German national anthem and party anthem, but when the British national anthem "God Save the King" was played, they all joined in singing with the Duke of Kent to show their respect.

<p>Madrid A special report from our reporter. Since Sunday of this week, the Nationalist forces have launched a major offensive in the area of Pozuelo and Majadahonda, northwest of Madrid, but as of today, heavy fog has blanketed the battlefield, obscuring visibility and halting the advance. Regarding the transportation situation in the northwest suburbs, semi-official sources claim that the main road to Corunna is still under Nationalist artillery fire, but the traffic between Madrid and the Guadarrama Mountains has not been cut off. It is generally believed that the Nationalist forces will continue to attack the government forces' defenses around Madrid, but so far, repeated offensives have failed. (5th, Havas)</p>

<p>Avila (In the hands of the Nationalists) A special report from our reporter. The Nationalist forces continued their offensive in the northwest suburbs of Madrid this morning, with particularly fierce fighting in the area of Las Rozas (15 kilometers from Madrid). As a result of yesterday's battle, the losses suffered by the government forces were even greater than initially estimated. According to the Northern Front Headquarters, the number of casualties in the International Brigades (volunteer forces composed of leftists from various countries) alone has exceeded 2,000. Nationalist authorities also claim that the government forces' fighting strength has declined recently and they are no longer able to resist as stubbornly as before. (5th, Havas)</p>
<p>Madrid Government forces defeated the rebel army north of Cordoba in the south on the 3rd of this month, capturing many prisoners.

<p>Valencia A warship belonging to the rebel army shelled the southern port of Almeria. At that time, a German cruiser was anchored near Cape Gata in the vicinity of the port. Regarding this matter, the garrison commander of this city recently issued a declaration stating, "The rebel army is now openly cooperating with Germany. Its navy will henceforth be sheltered by German warships and will use those warships to carry out espionage activities, so as to harass the coastal area and implement a blockade without any concern."

<p>[Rome] Italian newspapers are now paying close attention to the dispute between Spain and Germany over the ship detention issue. Semi-official sources refuse to comment, saying only that this issue is not related to Italy and the government does not wish to intervene.

<h3>要求停派志願兵英促意德答覆</h3>
<p>Britain urges Italy and Germany to respond to demand to stop sending volunteers</p>
<p>葡萄牙已在原則上接受　德軍活動法報言之鑿鑿</p>
<p>Portugal has accepted in principle, French press speaks authoritatively of German troop activity</p>
<p>[London] The British government, having received multiple reports that foreign volunteer units continue to enter Spain, has telegraphed Berlin and Rome, requesting a swift response before the end of this week to the joint British-French communiqué of December 23 regarding the issue of volunteer units. The British government has informed the French government of this action. It has been solemnly stated in several recent meetings of the International Non-Intervention Agreement Committee on the Spanish Civil War that each country's allowance of volunteer units to enter Spain does not violate the existing scope of the Non-Intervention Agreement, but that it is necessary for each country to jointly discuss measures to prohibit foreign nationals from participating in domestic wars. According to sources in London, Britain and France jointly sent documents to Germany, Italy, Russia, and Portugal at Christmas, requesting that they swiftly take measures to prevent volunteer units from entering Spanish territory. Although the large number of foreigners landing in Spain at present cannot be said to violate the Non-Intervention Agreement, it is contrary to the spirit of the Agreement. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The Portuguese government's reply to the British-French note has already been delivered to the Foreign Office yesterday. According to well-informed sources, the content of this reply states that Portugal has accepted in principle the measure of prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain to assist in the war, but on the condition that all countries participate unanimously. Moreover, no Portuguese nationals have participated in the Spanish Civil War, and therefore this measure is unnecessary as far as Portugal is concerned. Finally, it states that the Portuguese government's presentation of this reply is absolutely unrelated to other governments. The so-called other governments are likely referring to Germany and Italy. (6th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] The Berlin correspondent of The Times claims that Germany will likely not issue its reply to the British-French note before Friday of this week. It is heard that its content will present several questions to Britain and France and will express doubts about the sincerity of other governments. It is feared that this intention is to delay matters. (6th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] The French building workers' representatives today passed a resolution to send volunteers to Spain to aid the government forces, and demanded that the government lift the ban on transporting military supplies to Spain. At the same time, French newspapers have begun to pay close attention to the activities of German troops on the rebel side. "Le Petit Parisien" today had a headline about the civil war, reading "German Army Occupies Three Villages". A report by Bain of "Le Parisien" also stated that German officers led a Nazi shock troop in the fighting in Madrid on Monday and that two other divisions have been mobilized in Germany, ready to go to the Spanish front. A reporter for "L'Œuvre" even fears that Germany will send at least 100,000 troops to Spain, deploying them on the French border. (5th, Guomin Dian)</p>
<h3>英意恊定</h3>
<p>The Anglo-Italian Agreement</p>
<p>與不干涉西亂　係截然為兩事</p>
<p>Is completely separate from non-intervention in Spanish Civil War</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the landing of Italian volunteers at the port of Cadiz in Spain on January 1 of this year, political figures have recently stated that British authorities at the port of Gibraltar only learned of it on January 3. The rumors that British side had prior knowledge of it are completely untrue. As for the claim made by some that after the Anglo-Italian gentlemen's agreement was concluded, Britain had allowed Italy to deal with communism in Spain freely, this rumor is even more laughable, because the issue of Anglo-Italian relations in the Mediterranean and the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish civil war currently being handled by the London Adjustment Committee are completely separate matters. (5th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] The Anglo-Italian gentlemen's agreement has just been concluded, and the news of the landing of 10,000 Italian volunteers at the port of Cadiz in Spain has immediately followed. Newspapers here have expressed dissatisfaction. The Times stated, 'The Italian government's failure to fundamentally change its course and continuing to send large numbers of troops to aid General Franco has not only failed to restore lost trust but has also created a bad impression, causing disappointment'. The News Chronicle stated, 'After carefully reviewing the Anglo-Italian gentlemen's agreement, a sense of aversion arises spontaneously. If Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can provide assurances that he is willing to cooperate sincerely with all countries to promote a non-intervention policy, then there would be a reason to sign the gentlemen's agreement'. The Daily Herald stated, 'Spokespersons for the German and Italian governments have now openly declared that a victory for the Spanish Republican government is not what Britain wants. Our government should promptly provide an explanation to dispel the suspicions about the truth of the gentlemen's agreement'. The Manchester Guardian stated, 'Anglo-Italian relations are now opening a new era, and the first chapter is the landing of Italian volunteers in Spain. Is this a good omen?' The Daily Express stated, 'The rumor that Italy intends to raise public debt in London has been rampant recently. We believe that any public debt used for war purposes, regardless of whether the debt raiser belongs to Italy or another country, should be rejected'. (6th, Havas)</p>

<p>Istanbul Kemal Atatürk, the President of Turkey, suddenly departed for Konya in southern Anatolia at dawn today. The Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Chief of Staff immediately met with him. The public is deeply worried that this sudden action may be related to the recent dispute between France and Turkey over Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria. According to the treaties concluded after the Great War, these two locations were conditionally ceded to Turkey. In December of last year, the Council of the League of Nations agreed on a temporary compromise as follows: (1) Dispatch League of Nations inspectors; (2) Withdraw the French reinforcements recently sent; (3) France will temporarily postpone ratifying the French-Syrian treaty, pending the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations to be held this month.

The next president will be the fourth since Finland's independence. The national election will be held on February 15 by 300 electoral bodies nationwide. The names of the four presidential candidates and their nominators are listed below: (1) Former President Stahlberg, nominated by the Progressive Party; (2) Speaker of the House of Representatives Kallio, nominated by the Agrarian Party; (3) Labor leader Tanner, nominated by the Social Democratic Party; (4) Incumbent President Svinhufvud, nominated by the non-partisan conservative National Coalition Party. The fascist party, which has very few members in Finland, originally nominated General Mannerheim as a presidential candidate, but because Mannerheim refused to participate, they decided to support incumbent President Dr. Svinhufvud. This election is expected to be more fierce than previous elections. (6th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>本年度日偽擴大熱河種烟範圍</h3>
<p>Japanese and puppet regime expand opium cultivation in Jehol this year</p>
<p>種烟面積為七千頃　積極毒化東北民衆</p>
<p>Opium cultivation area is 7,000 hectares, Actively poisoning the people of Northeast China</p>
<p>Chengde Correspondence: Jehol Province has always been an area with barren land and poor people. The economy is extremely depleted. During the transition between seasons, farmers rely entirely on opium to subsidize and maintain their lives. In the past, when the Japanese and puppet regimes first occupied Jehol, they used the beauty of 'benevolent rule' as a propaganda tool, expressing that they would adopt a gradual prohibition policy for Jehol's opium administration. In reality, this was just a transitional method to gain fame and cultivate support. Now, the Japanese and puppet authorities have profited greatly from opium, and military and administrative expenses all rely on it. Furthermore, it can be used to poison the people of Northeast China. Therefore, they have decided to delay the ban on opium cultivation and have formulated specific policies for opium administration. The Opium Prohibition Guidance Bureau has been merged into the police department of the puppet provincial government and renamed the Opium Administration Section. The opium prohibition guidance branch bureaus attached to the various counties will also be reorganized. The Japanese side believes that the handling of opium administration will definitely have a new era of unified system in the future. It has also been found that this year, according to the regulations of the puppet central authorities, the area for opium cultivation in the entire Jehol Province is 7,000 hectares, and Chengde is allocated a quota of 270 hectares, an increase of 2,000 hectares compared to last year. The distribution quotas for each district are recorded below. First District: 2,250 mu; Second District: 4,000 mu; Third District: 1,400 mu; Fourth District: 5,500 mu; Fifth District: 6,600 mu; Sixth District: 7,250 mu.</p>
<h3>日偽確定嚴厲限制勞工出關</h3>
<p>Japanese and puppet regime determined to strictly restrict laborers from leaving the Pass</p>
<p>實施五年計劃勞工應增反减　儘用日工人並予冀東優先權</p>
<p>Labor should increase rather than decrease during the implementation of the five-year plan, Give priority to Japanese workers and eastern Hebei</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan Correspondence: Before the 'September 18th' Incident, no less than hundreds of thousands of laborers went to the Northeast every year to seek a living, with the most from Shandong Province, followed by Hebei Province. These laborers mostly travelled on small ticket cars (ie, fourth-class cars) of the Beining Railway. Later, the Japanese forcibly occupied the Northeast, and the puppet regime was created by the Japanese, so they strictly restricted laborers from Shandong and Hebei from going to the Northeast. According to Japanese statistics, the number of laborers from Shandong and Hebei provinces who went to the Northeast in the previous year was 500,000, and last year it was 300,000. These laborers are all strictly inspected by the Japanese and puppet authorities. They are only released after being deemed to have no dangerous elements among them. This year is the first year of the Japanese and puppet regime's implementation of the so-called five-year plan in the Northeast, and the need for laborers should have increased, but the reality is very different. The Japanese and puppet labor control committee has decided that the number of laborers from inside the Pass who are allowed to go to the Northeast this year is limited to 380,000. Among them, in view of the special relationship between the area under the jurisdiction of the puppet government of eastern Hebei and the area belonging to the puppet organization, laborers in that area are given priority to go to the Northeast. In addition, Japanese people are mostly used for important workers. According to the labor control committee, they intend to impose extremely strict control and restrictions on laborers who continue to go to the Northeast and laborers who are already stationed in the Northeast.</p>
<h3>The Stalemated Situation on the Border</h3>
<p>De Wang and Wang Ying separately recruit soldiers; a certain party provides them with weapons and funds.</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence: The situation on the border remains stalemated. Because the various bandit armies are being reorganized, dispatched, and re-equipped, the battles in Taolin and Yihe in eastern Suiyuan, and Wuchuan in northern Suiyuan have not resumed. During this period, the puppet troops of Rehe stationed in various parts of Chahar Province are looting villages northwest of Shangdu. The puppet special task force under Li Shousin, stationed in Shangdu city, also received orders on the 2nd of this month to move out, with the puppet leader Guanmen Baile (whose troops are all Mongolians) stationed in the northwest villages.</p>
<p>Mu Gaihua Actively Expands His Forces</p>
<p>On the 3rd, according to sources from Jiabusi, Mu Gaihua (also known as Mu Kedengbin, whose Mongolian troops were previously dissolved by Jin Xianzhang, leaving only a few remaining) repeatedly requested De Wang to expand his forces again. De Wang has now approved his request, ordering Mu to recruit 300 able-bodied men each from the Zhengbai and Biao Huang banners. For any shortfall, Mu is authorized to recruit independently from various locations. Mu has already dispatched people to the Zhengbai and Xiang Huang banners to recruit soldiers, and is also sending people to various places to recruit troops, actively expanding his forces. The weapons used will be allocated from the Jiabusi military depot with the approval of a certain party's special agency chief, after De Wang's negotiation.</p>
<p>Wang Ying Recruits Soldiers in Southeastern Hebei</p>
<p>After repeated defeats in eastern and northern Suiyuan, the bandit leader Wang Ying's forces were scattered and disintegrated, almost leaving him alone. Despite his sorry state, he still clings to his ambition to rise again, running around under the wing of a certain special agency chief in Jiabusi. It is said that he has obtained assistance from a certain party, and the earlier rumor of him recruiting 5,000 men has now become a reality. The special agency chief has provided Wang Ying with 20,000 yuan in temporary expansion funds. Wang Ying himself has already received the funds and is still using Shangdu as his base. On the 1st of this month, he sent more than 30 trusted followers to the areas of eastern and southern Hebei to secretly recruit soldiers. Wang is also vigorously calling on his old troops in Shangdu.</p>
<p>Yin, the Traitor, Scatters Leaflets from Airplanes</p>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, at noon, Yin Rugeng, the traitor who has seized eastern Hebei, sent a plane to circle over Zhangbei, scattering leaflets, pamphlets, and discarded five-colored national flags. The wording was insane, mad, and utterly absurd. At 1 PM, it flew to Zhangjiakou again. When it was flying, it was very close to the ground. The plane was green with white wings and numbered 1006. Many citizens picked up the scattered leaflets and pamphlets.</p>
<p>The Discipline of the Puppet Xing'an Army is Extremely Poor</p>
<p>The puppet Xing'an Garrison Army, which recently came from western Rehe, is now stationed in Nanhuaoqian via Zhangbei. However, the discipline of this army is excessively lax. After arriving in Vietnamese Huaoqian, they commit adultery, robbery, and all sorts of evil deeds, even worse than the bandits under Zhang Wanqing and the puppet troops of Rehe under Wang Jingxiu. The local people hate them even more than they hate the bandits and puppet troops. (3rd)</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Province Plans to Develop Niu Mountain Island</h3>
<p>The Aquatic Products Experiment Station Sends Personnel to Investigate; The Waters Around the Islands Are Extremely Rich in Fish</p>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: The Niu Mountain Islands are located in the sea near Xiangshan, consisting of nine small islands. The largest of these is South Niu Mountain, which is about nine *li* long and two *li* wide, covering an area of about 50,000 *mu*. The island is covered with lush vegetation, the soil is loose and fertile, and there is a supply of fresh water. The waters around the islands are rich fishing grounds, such as the large yellow croaker fishing grounds of Damuyang, and the small yellow croaker fishing grounds between Liuheng, Jiangjunmao, and the Black Mountain Islands, all of which are not far from the island. Logically, the island should be an important fishing base for Zhejiang Province. However, for many years, bandits have used the area as a place to come and go, and robberies have been common. Therefore, many fishermen who are interested in operating in the area are discouraged, and the island is barren, with no supply of supplies for fishermen, and inconvenient transportation, making it difficult to transport and sell catches, making operations even more difficult. Fang Youdu and other gentlemen from Huangyan in this province, seeing the importance of the island to the fishing industry, suggested to the Director Chen of the Provincial Aquatic Products Experiment Station last year that the island be developed. The station then ordered technician Lin Maochun to conduct a detailed inspection of the island when he investigated the Ningxiang fishing industry. However, because the island was a gathering place for bandits, civilian ships dared not go there, and only inquired about the situation in the vicinity. According to his report, the fish production near the island is very high. Those who ventured there, if they were not robbed, returned fully loaded. Currently, the drift net boats from Ninghai, Xiangshan, Nantian, and other counties are fishing near the island, but they dare not approach the island. This year, the number of fishing boats robbed has reached as many as 16 in Xiashan village alone, which shows the rampant situation of pirates. The station could not bear to see this good fishing base abandoned, and planned to suggest that the provincial government develop the island. It is heard that they have now submitted a request to the Construction Department to borrow a warship and travel to the island for a detailed investigation.</p>
<h3>Kunshan</h3>
<p>Special Commissioner from Hunan Inspects the Police System</p>
<p>Luo Shouyi, the Special Commissioner of the First District of Hunan Province, along with Zhang Yufen, the magistrate of Anxiang County, Zhang Yanjue, the magistrate of Zhicheng County, Chen Shuyuan, the magistrate of Wugang County, Huang Shaoqiong, the magistrate of Chengbu County, and others, a group of more than ten people, came to Kunshan on the 5th to inspect the police district system. The Director of Public Security, Dong Xueshu, accompanied them to visit various patrol stations and police districts, and conducted a detailed inspection, so as to learn from it and study its trial implementation.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Transit Grain is Prohibited from Extortion</p>
<p>The provincial government previously issued interim measures strictly prohibiting the export of food, and the county government has received approval to abolish them in this county. Because of the large amount of grain in transit, often exceeding 100,000 *shi*, the Water Patrol Team of the Public Security Bureau and the County Chamber of Commerce specially formulated measures for inspecting grain in transit in the county, inspecting it at Huangtian Port. It was found that some commercial committee members and unemployed people in the North Wai area took the opportunity to extort 13 cents per *shi* for "inspection fees", which was actually harming merchants and the people. The Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaocen, specially submitted a request to the county to abolish the previously issued inspection measures and announced that extortion under the pretext of prohibiting transportation was not allowed.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Investigation and Arrest of Opium Criminals</p>
<p>The Jiangdu County Government is working hard to investigate and arrest opium criminals, and has been quite tense in recent days. Since December 26, it has arrested more than 1,000 opium addicts who have surrendered in urban and rural areas. The county government police station and political police dormitory are full of prisoners, with no room for more, so they are being held in the Zunjing Pavilion of the old county school. All the drug rehabilitation centers are also overcrowded. It is heard that the government provides 10 cents a day for their rations, but they find it difficult to swallow, resulting in new and old porridge and rice being mixed together, and there is a surplus every day. On the 5th, each household registration police officer went to each Bao Yang Chu, saying that they were ordered to arrest two opium criminals per police officer, and each Bao had to hand over at least one person. The Bao chiefs were very hesitant because those who smoked opium had already been arrested, and the rest had either escaped or were in hiding.</p>
<p>The Lower Reaches of the Grand Canal Dry Up</p>
<p>Every winter, the water level of the Jiangdu Canal inevitably falls again and again. Since the completion and opening of the Shao Bo ship lock in Huaiyin, the water level above Shao Bo has been more than twice as high this winter as in the past. Therefore, ships traveling to and from Zhun to Shao are unimpeded. The water below Zhun Shao Bo, because there are no relevant dams to store water, is completely discharged. In addition, since the beginning of winter this year, there has been little rainfall, resulting in even shallower water in the river from Shao to Guazhoukou, making it difficult for ships to move even an inch in the eighty-odd *li* from Shao Bo to Guazhoukou. It is now heard that the Party authorities are aware of this and plan to find a solution as soon as spring warms up. It is heard that they will build an activity dam at Guazhoukou to intercept the water below Shao Bo, so as to avoid the complete interruption of water traffic in this section.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Re-examination of the Liuqiao Murder Case</p>
<p>Qian Guilin, a villager from Liuqiao District, was found dead in a grass field, and his kidneys had also been cut out. The court's inspection office reported the case, investigated the scene, and arrested the murderer. Ding Wenhai confessed, saying that the deceased had committed adultery with his mother, and he killed him out of anger. However, as a result of the investigation, it was determined that the circumstances did not match, and the accomplice, Shi Hongsheng, was still at large. On the 5th, the police transported Qian Guilin's coffin to the Huoxing Temple in the north of the city, where Inspector Lin reopened the coffin for re-examination.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Soldier Arrested for Robbing a Gold Ring</p>
<p>At about 3 PM on the 5th, Chen Xianggu, a soldier from a certain battalion wearing a gray cotton uniform, age 21, entered the Baocheng Silver Shop on Jiaxing North Street and wanted to buy a pair of gold rings weighing two *qian*. The shop assistant Lu Kaixiang took out a gold ring weighing two *qian* and two *li* for inspection, priced at 24 yuan, 6 jiao, 4 fen, and 2 li. While they were negotiating the price, the soldier held the gold ring and, under the pretext of spitting phlegm, ran out. The shop assistant Lu Kaixiang and two others tried their best to chase after him. The soldier crossed Rong'an Bridge and fled into the Jiang Iron Shop on Xiatang Street. The entire squad of the security team and the detective team of the patrol battalion were dispatched to search for him. At 5:40 PM, the soldier was found hiding in a pile of firewood at door number 169 and arrested. However, the stolen goods had been discarded. He was immediately taken to the county government for detention and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Huang Dao Raises Shares for Bandits to Surrender</p>
<p>Huang Daoshou, Huang Chunshan and others, famous pirates who have been rampant in the waters near Xiangshan Port and Dinghai Shenjiamen, surrendered on the 3rd. After the Water Police Bureau received a report from the Hai Hu patrol boat, it telegraphed Commissioner Pang of Wenzhou to inquire and ordered the Marine Special Task Force stationed in Haimen to investigate and report in detail. It is heard that the number of people who surrendered reached more than 60, with 60 rifles and 15 wooden-case guns, all of which have been handed over.</p>
<p>Two Pirates Executed by Firing Squad</p>
<p>The bandit leader Xiao Lao Wu, also known as Feng Jungui, and the bandit Wang Aji, had repeatedly committed crimes such as kidnapping and extortion in Jiaotoushi, Shizikou, Xiaoputuo, and other places on the borders of Ningxiang and Fengjiao. In December of last year, they were captured by the Foreign Water Public Security Bureau and sent to the Sixth District Security Command for interrogation, where they were found guilty and sentenced to death. Now, they have received an order from the provincial government to execute each sentence. The District Command tied the two bandits to the Huama Road execution ground in this port at 10 AM on the 4th and executed them by firing squad.</p>
<p>Change of Magistrate in Fenghua County</p>
<p>Cao Zhongxi, the Magistrate of Fenghua County, and his secretary Wu Mingjing, Chief of the First Section Ye Longzhong, Chief of the Second Section Li Bingsong, and Chief of the Third Section Xiang Xinming, went to Japan to study and submitted their resignations to the Ning government, which were approved. The vacancy for Magistrate of Fenghua County was filled by Lin Deyan, who was appointed by the Department of Civil Affairs and took office on the 4th.</p>
<p>The Meteorological Observatory Begins Operations</p>
<p>The Dinghai Shenjiamen Meteorological Observatory, located on the top of Longyan Mountain near the sea, has a panoramic view of Putuo and the fishing boats of the East China Sea. Overlooking the Shenzhen fishing port, with its sails lined up, it is extremely convenient for measuring the climate and reporting the wind direction. The equipment in the observatory was subsidized by the Meteorological Research Institute of the Academia Sinica and had been shipped long ago. Because installation took time, it was only completed at the end of last year. The observatory officially opened on New Year's Day. Ge Shihua, the provincial water conservancy bureau's designated meteorologist stationed in Dinghai, was ordered to return to the province. The designated meteorological site was also abolished.</p>
<h3>Jiashan</h3>
<p>Zhang Feng Goes to Xushan for Archeological Research</p>
<p>Zhang Feng, a professor at Jinan University, is a native of this county. He has discovered more than 1,000 kinds of antiquities in the Jiangzhe area. The Provincial Library specifically opened a personal exhibition for Zhang on the 3rd. Zhang, accompanied by Zhou Ji, the secretary of the land survey office, Fu Ruan, the director of the county library, and four others, sailed to Xushan in the southwest of the county for archeological research. Qingshan is the site of Wu Zixu's former residence. Among the discoveries were a tripod foot of a large *ding*, shaped like a cow's hoof, similar to those unearthed in Yuecheng, Suzhou; two unknown pottery pieces, shaped like broken tree branches, with slanted small holes in the middle, similar to those unearthed in Lujiang, Wuxi; three or four pieces of thick-glazed pottery fragments, from the Zhou and Qin dynasties, with a deep purple color, which are particularly special; half a piece of magnetic imitation *bi*, shaped like an arched *bi*, with remnants and green pottery fragments; three or four pieces of late Zhou geometric patterns, coated with ancient green and vermilion, with the vermilion ones being more elegant; and a brick from the Song and Yuan dynasties with the characters "Shan Hai".</p>
<h3>Bengbu</h3>

<p>The second type of income tax, the salary and remuneration income of public officials, and the third type of income tax, the interest income of public bonds, were levied in October of last year. In Bengbu, the treasury branch of the Central Bank collected the taxes on behalf of the government. The remaining first type of income tax, the income from business operations; the second type, the remuneration income of self-employed persons and other professionals; and the third type, the stock and deposit interest income of company bonds, were officially announced by the Ministry of Finance to be collected continuously starting on the 1st. Here, the Central Bank has officially started collecting all the taxes on the 5th. All income taxes are to be paid by the taxpayers themselves, and the collection office does not send personnel to collect them.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Compulsory Physical Education Activities in All Middle Schools Starting Next Semester</h3>
<p>All students must participate in morning exercises or recess exercises for a quarter of an hour in the morning. ▲ No classes are allowed after 3 PM; one hour must be spent on exercise.</p>
<p>[Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Education has issued an order to all departments, stating: "After investigating the current number of teaching hours in junior high schools, the Ministry has appropriately reduced them, averaging about five hours per day. According to reasonable allocation, there should be no classes after 3 PM at the latest. However, in practice, various schools still inevitably have situations such as increasing class hours without authorization or not allocating class hours reasonably, which hinders students' physical education activities and seriously affects the physical and mental health of young people. In order to correct this malady, and to actively improve teaching and physical training efficiency, it has been decided that, starting next semester, the daily teaching time for all junior and senior high schools shall be from 8 AM to 3 PM. After 3 PM, it will be used as extracurricular exercise time, and no classes are allowed under any circumstances. Morning exercises or recess exercises will be arranged in the morning, and all students must participate compulsorily. Educational administrative agencies should supervise and urge the implementation at any time, and list it as one of the school's performance evaluations. It is hereby ordered that all junior and senior high schools under your jurisdiction must comply with this requirement starting next semester." The main points of the five articles of the "Provisional Measures for Compulsory Extracurricular Exercise in Secondary Schools" are: 1. Extracurricular exercise should be held after 3 PM, and all students must participate compulsorily. Each student should have at least two hours of exercise per day. Morning exercises or recess exercises should be held in the morning or during recess in the morning, lasting for fifteen minutes. All students must participate. In cold winter, short days, or rainy and hot seasons, morning exercises can be changed to recess exercises. 2. When compiling the curriculum, schools should not schedule classes after 3 PM every day. 3. The types of extracurricular exercise should be determined according to the age, gender, physical strength, and needs of the students. 4. In co-educational schools, girls, except for morning exercises and recess exercises that can be taught together with boys, should practice extracurricular exercise separately from boys.</p>
<h3>Fudan and Jinan Win Tiecheng Cup Basketball Games</h3>
<p>An Unfortunate Incident Occurs During the Municipal Sports Students' Exhibition of Skills; Liu Renhao of Fudan Middle School is Beaten and Seriously Injured</p>
<p>In yesterday's three Tiecheng Cup basketball games, Chi Zhi narrowly defeated the Hornets, the Xin team collapsed and lost to Fudan, and Jinan defeated the Five Dragons.</p>
<p>After yesterday's game, shouts of hitting and cries for help were suddenly heard in the wasteland outside the gymnasium. Upon investigation, it was found that dozens of students from the Municipal Sports School were surrounding three students from Fudan Middle School and fighting fiercely. After onlookers stepped forward to mediate and rescue them, the matter could have been settled. Unexpectedly, when they reached the entrance of the swimming pool, the Municipal Sports School students swarmed in again, beating one of the Fudan Middle School students to the ground, with blood flowing from his left eye. Dozens of police officers came to suppress the situation, but they were still unable to resolve it until the teachers of the school scolded the students and sent them back. The injured student was seriously injured. His name is Liu Renhao, and he was taken back to school by other students in a hired car. According to the investigation, the reason for the fight was that there was a quarrel while watching the game. After the game, they retaliated. It has been noted that students from the Municipal Sports School often act disorderly and make strange noises when watching games, which is resented by other spectators. Yesterday, the students of the Municipal School used force to beat people, which is truly disappointing.</p>
<p>Chi Zhi Defeats the Hornets</p>
<p>The Hornets played with much progress yesterday. Chi Zhi lost to the Hornets by 15 to 23 in the first half. In the second half, the Hornets were still fierce, once taking a lead of 29 to 19. Unfortunately, their stamina did not last until the end, and Chi Zhi caught up. However, the performance was very exciting.</p>
<p>Fudan Defeats the Xin Team</p>
<p>The game between the Xin team and Fudan was quite dull. The Xin team's luck was not good, and they were never able to gain the upper hand. Li Zhenzhong only scored four points personally, which shows the lack of coordination. On the other hand, Fudan was very strong, and their long shots were accurate. Zhou Dayun scored 22 points alone, and the Xin team's defeat was due to this person.</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen opened the scoring with a two-handed shot, and then Zhou Yuanyun scored three consecutive goals. The Xin team called a timeout, but Zhou Dayun and Chen Zongqi scored again and again, taking a commanding lead of 10 to 2. The Xin team called another timeout. Chen Xianglong added points with two free throws due to Zhou Dayun's foul, and then scored again. Li Zhenzhong made a wonderful pass, and Feng Nianhua scored, gradually breaking the dull situation at 8 to 10. Fudan called a timeout. Zhou Dayun and Qiu Guangshi scored again and again, creating a score of 21 to 8 in one go. After Sun Baoqing and Chen Xianglong of the Xin team scored, Chuan Xiangrui and Weng Ren'an each scored a goal. In the first half, Fudan led 25 to 12. In the second half, Weng Ren'an scored first, and Feng Nianhua pulled back. Then Zhou Dayun, Qiu Guangshi, and Chen Zongqi each scored a goal. Chen Xianglong made all of his free throws, and Weng Ren'an scored again, making the score 36 to 16, even further apart. After that, Feng Nianhua tried to rally, and Li Zhenzhong started to show his skills, but the Fudan players' power did not diminish, and they fought more and more bravely, eventually winning by 50 to 29.</p>
<h3>Small Talk</h3>
<p>— Huai Qing</p>
<p>A Conversation About Huang Bochang and Zha Ruilong</p>
<p>Date: An afternoon during the New Year</p>
<p>Location: ×× Teahouse on Nanjing Road</p>
<p>Characters: A, B, C, D (representing the four people present, names not to be disclosed)</p>
<p>Friends met at the ×× Teahouse during the New Year for a free-ranging chat, to add to the festive atmosphere. Especially because everyone shared the same interests, the conversation gradually turned to the "old profession" of sports, and the newly emerging game of wrestling that is popular at sea became the center of the discussion. The words "Huang Bochang" slipped out of everyone's mouths from time to time, and this led to the recently approved by the National Sports Association to restore the amateur qualifications of Zha Ruilong, leading to a great truth about professional sports and amateur sports.</p>
<p>D: I heard that Huang Bochang's wrestling is very good. What is it like? I really want to see it sometime.</p>
<p>B: It is worth seeing, but it is inevitably tainted with a "savage" atmosphere. Huang Bochang's technique is certainly worthy of admiration; but many Indians have more strength than him, especially Mihasin. I don't believe that they can't beat Huang.</p>
<p>C: It can be said to be fake, or it can be said to be real. The competition is indeed very exciting and moving; but the atmosphere of selling art is too strong. Professional sports, especially these kinds of boxing and wrestling, aim at gimmicks. As long as they can arouse the audience's interest, how can they have more games and absorb more tickets. Before Huang Bochang came to Shanghai, there were also these games, but no one paid attention, so the competitions were only held once or twice a month, and also because there were no Chinese people. Because Huang Bochang is Chinese, and China has never discovered such a talent, it is of course worth everyone's support to see, so business is booming, and it is held once a week. The Indians only want money, what does it matter if they lose? If they compete with others, even if they win, they won't get half as much money as they lose now.</p>
<p>A: Shanghainese only care about new things and gimmicks. They don't care about 3 or 4 yuan for a ticket. But it must be said that even if Huang Bochang wins a few more times, not many people will want to see it again. Seeing too much will always get boring, not to mention that there is inevitably a kind of "business" at work in it! I do hope that they can have a "real" fight, but even if it is a "real" fight, who can still believe it?</p>
<p>B: The National Sports Association recently resolved at a board meeting to allow Zha Ruilong to restore his amateur status. I think that even if this matter does not conflict with amateur rules, what is the point? What's more, whether a person who specializes in selling art can restore his amateur status is still a question. If you really want to recruit talent, isn't Huang Bochang better?</p>
<p>A: If Huang Bochang himself is willing to give up professional wrestling, because there is a precedent to follow, he will definitely be able to restore his amateur status. I can guarantee that Huang Bochang will definitely win the heavyweight wrestling championship flag at the World Games. If the National Sports Association really wants to recruit talents like Zha Ruilong, why not try to promote Huang Bochang? Huang is indeed an outstanding talent!</p>
<p>C: Huang Bochang? If you ask him to become an amateur, would he agree? He now has an income of 1-2,000 yuan a month, isn't he comfortable? If he became an amateur athlete, then how would he live? Even if he is not afraid of not having a way to live, is there still such comfort and freedom? If I were Huang Bochang, I would not agree. What is life for after all?</p>
<p>A: Most so-called professional athletes are actually not real professional athletes who came from sports in China - they want to restore their amateur status because they feel that there is no way out for the professional, and they want to mix into the amateur world again to find a better way out. I don't believe that a professional athlete with a very rich income would be willing to return to the dead end of the amateur old home. Like Huang Bochang, would he be willing? This is certain.</p>
<p>D: I heard that Zha Ruilong once made a movie with the words "Strong Man" and sold his skills in Southeast Asia and other places. How can he still restore his amateur status?</p>
<p>C: I think the amateur sports rules would not have a provision that allows artists to restore their qualifications, otherwise what would the amateur rules be for?</p>
<p>A: Wang Wenzheng is a McCague, and will be a McCague for the rest of his life; but he is not a seller of art—if he did not restore his amateur status, he would never have been appointed as the secretary of a division commander in Sichuan. In fact, he is still a disguised professional athlete. Because of Wang Wenzheng's rise to prominence, similar things will continue to happen. And the spirit of these athletes often cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p>B: In Huang Bochang's second game against Mihasin, Huang was very rude to the referee twice, which he really shouldn't have been.</p>
<p>D: Old Teng scolded him very harshly in the newspaper that day.</p>
<p>C: Actually, what does this have to do with sportsmanship? These are all gimmicks, to make you believe that the competition is so intense and fierce, and you will never suspect that there is anything fake about it! Although Old Teng scolds well, I don't admire him for using the words "sportsmanship" to blame him.</p>
<p>A: Chinese athletes are now walking on two paths: ㊀ Professional athletes who have no way out want to join the amateurs and find another way out. ㊁ Famous amateurs, with the "amateur" label as a guise, take the opportunity to use the tricks of professionals as much as possible. Also, leading teams to foreign competitions and splitting up ticket sales have become an open secret. In short, professional sports have no way out in China, because the level of the entire sports industry is still too far behind, so they have to use the "amateur" label to run their own affairs. The situation is the opposite of that in foreign countries. This is also a symbol of the deformed development of Chinese sports.</p>

<h3>West Qing Basketball</h3>
<p>Qingguang Overwhelms Mailing Yi, Xin Team Battles Jinan Tonight</p>
<p>There was originally one match scheduled for West Qing basketball last night. The first match, Zhen Dan vs. Moore in the regular division, was postponed. The university division match between John and Shanghai University was extremely close. The first half ended with a score of 16-16, making it difficult to determine a winner. In the second half, Shanghai University scored 19 points due to accurate free throws, while John was only one point short, resulting in a close score of 35-34, with Shanghai University narrowly winning. In the second match, Qingguang vs. Mailing Yi in the independent division was also very close. Qingguang was slightly behind by two points in the first half with a score of 12-10. After the break, Mailing Yi once exceeded with a score of 22-20, but Qingguang gradually increased their score, resulting in a final score of 33-38, with Qingguang winning.

The business group has 32 teams, the school group has 14 teams, and the bank group has 6 teams. However, the women's group is small with only 3 teams. In total, there are 55 teams. Registration for all groups has closed, but due to an insufficient number of women's teams, the deadline has been extended. To promote women's basketball, an exception has been made to allow those already participating in other competitions to register to prevent the three registered teams from being left out due to a lack of players. The deadline is the 15th of this month, and no further extensions will be granted. The business and bank groups will start their matches this Saturday (the 9th). The business group has too many teams and is divided into four divisions: Business 1, Business 2, Business 3, and Business 4, each with eight teams.

<h3>National Directory of Universities, Middle Schools, and Primary Schools Published</h3>
<p>Compiled by Xu Wancheng, Published by Longwen Bookstore: A Comprehensive Compilation of Surveys of Schools Across the Country</p>
<p>Our country has traditionally paid little attention to investigation and statistical expertise. Now, Mr. Xu Wancheng, who has served in the Shanghai education sector for many years and has a spirit of practical implementation, has devoted his efforts to compiling a comprehensive volume entitled 'National Directory of Universities, Middle Schools, and Primary Schools.' Details regarding the names and addresses of universities and middle schools, dates of establishment, type of institution, school building issues, regular expenses per semester, number of departments and levels, names and brief biographies of current principals, names of the most experienced faculty members, number of faculty members, monthly salaries of faculty members, number of students, student fees, the school's educational philosophy, difficulties in running the school, and brief information about the library, including the name of the librarian, are particularly detailed. The general educational situation in various provinces and cities across the country, as well as the names and brief biographies of the heads of education bureaus in various counties, the overall educational situation in the county, such as the number of schools, funding, and special conditions in each county, are even more accurate. The names, addresses, and general information of large-scale primary schools in various counties across the country are listed one by one. The vastness of our country makes Xu's thoroughness particularly commendable. The assistance of more than thirty people, including Ren Yangxiu, Zhao Jinqi, Zhu Songyue, Zhu Kunyue, Zhou Shoumei, Mao Shiying, Zhu Bingran, and Huang Shengtian, was obtained before and after, and it took years to complete. It is truly an unprecedented comprehensive compilation for the education sector. It is said that Cai Yuanpei provided a lot of assistance during the investigation. After the book was completed, Cai praised its realization of ambitions and personally wrote a preface. There are also prefaces by Tang Wenzhi and Huang Jingwan, as well as a title by calligrapher Ma Gongyu. It also includes many articles such as overviews of education in various provinces and cities across the country, as well as a glimpse of opinions from people in the national education sector, forming a grand spectacle. The entire book is a large volume, with a real price of twelve yuan per copy. Educational institutions can purchase it at a 30% discount, limited to direct purchases from the Longwen Bookstore Publishing House at Dananmen in Shanghai. Distributors include the Dagong Newspaper Agency on Sima Road in Shanghai and the author's publishing house.</p>
<h3>City Museum Opens</h3>

<p>Revival Bonds on the Rise, Unified Bonds Hover with Slight Weakness, Donation of One Cent per Ten Thousand for Birthday Wishes and Aid to Suiyuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was calm, and market fluctuations were minimal. The overall situation was stable, but the bulls were gradually selling, and the number of chips on the table was gradually increasing. Retail investors were quite volatile due to the upcoming Revival Bonds. The market price was slightly weak due to some major players absorbing them. The Exchange received an order from the Ministry of Finance, announcing that spot and near- and far-term futures trading of the 25th year Revival Bonds will begin today, with the same trading rules as the Unified Bonds. Since these bonds are purely controlled by the financial sector and there are very few chips outside, the market outlook may be similar to that of Type A bonds and may be subject to crushing at times. The Brokers Association announced that a donation of one cent per ten thousand transactions will be collected for birthday wishes and aid to the Suiyuan soldiers, expressing patriotic enthusiasm. The donation will not be collected for 96. In the morning opening, Type E and D bonds were relatively firm, rising by one or two cents. Type D bonds from next month, such as 5.77, were sold off in large numbers, and market prices fell by two to three cents. In the second round, Type E continued to fall by five cents and two cents. Type D and A bonds rose by five cents and one cent due to relatively more purchases from 43 and retail investors. In the afternoon opening, the market was quite weak due to the upcoming Revival Bonds, and sales of 5.77, etc., became more prevalent, and market prices fell by five cents and half a cent. At the close, market prices rose by five cents to two and a half cents due to an influx of purchases from 10.47, etc. Overall, major stocks fell by five cents to two and a half cents, while Type D near-term bonds rose by one or two cents. The total transaction volume was 5,815,000 yuan. The comparison of increases and decreases is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Flour Market Hit the Limit Down Yesterday, Foreign Wheat Reported Lower Prices and Russian Wheat Harvest, Market Value Too High and Actual Sales Contracted, All Months Fell by One Cent</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market in the morning, prices for all months showed a uniform sharp decline. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago fell by about one yuan, Canada fell by 80 cents, and Liverpool fell by two bents. After the opening price, the market was already extremely uneasy. Because foreign wheat prices were low, and it was rumored that the Soviet Union wheat harvest was abundant. As for the domestic situation, after the market gradually became more expensive, the actual digestion inevitably decreased invisibly. Although the absorption of outsiders was strong, actual sales were not smooth, and very few buyers followed. Therefore, under natural pressure, the market atmosphere could not recover, and it has already fallen by seven or eight cents compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the market felt even more depressed, and all months fell to the limit of one cent. After that, the market stagnated. Inquiries regarding this situation, the near-term causes were tightly linked to the fall in foreign wheat prices, and the long-term causes were due to the excessive market value. All actual sales customers have invisibly contracted.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat Plunges, Term Wheat Also Falls by More Than Twenty Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the term wheat market continued to show a sharp decline. The fall in foreign wheat quotations was particularly strong. As for the rumors of the factory continuing to set prices, people in the industry learned that this was indeed the case. Therefore, after the opening price, the market was very weak, falling sharply by one cent compared to the closing price of the previous day. Later, short-term bulls continued to sell, falling another three to five cents. By the afternoon opening, the market atmosphere was bad, and sales were strong while purchases were weak. The opening price for all months slackened again. The lowest price for March even reached 6.86 yuan, a huge fall of 24 cents compared to the previous day. Although the current market value of June new wheat is high, it is cheaper than old wheat, so the fall was less severe, only falling by one cent. Because the standard has fallen sharply, the current wheat market also saw prices loosen by nearly a cent. Opening prices were 6.6 yuan for Liuhe wheat, 6.59 yuan for Jiangbei wheat, 56 cents for second-grade, 6.53 yuan for Shaoxing wheat, 50 cents for second-grade, 45 cents for third-grade, 6.57 yuan for Shipai wheat, 6.53 yuan for Wuhu wheat, and 6.62 yuan for Wuhe wheat. A total of 10,000 bags were handled by Fuxin.</p>
<p>Kexian Market Remains Active, But Sales are Not as Smooth as Before</p>
<p>Yesterday, Kexian arrivals and sales were both strong, and the market remained active. However, after the continuous handling by Japanese merchants, the appetite was not as greedy as before. Yesterday, Guang Merchants only handled more than 5,000 bags of various types of unpolished rice, and the local street also handled five or six thousand bags. Other retail investors only added a little. The total transaction volume for the whole day was still 12,000 to 13,000 bags, but the appetite has slackened, and the market shows signs of weakness. Although the prices were similar to the previous market, they have been secretly reduced by three to five cents. 7,000 bags of Jiangxi rice, 2,860 bags of Hunan rice, 2,000 bags of Han unpolished rice, and 700 bags of Wenxian rice were opened for sale throughout the day.</p>
<p>Downstream Rice Market Fell More Than It Rose</p>
<p>[North of Shanghai] Yesterday, 43 to 44 boats arrived from various routes downstream. The sales of various types of rice in the market were weak in the morning, and the stockpiling of white glutinous rice and scattered transactions moved slightly in the afternoon. The price of white glutinous rice fell slightly by nearly a cent in the morning and stabilized in the afternoon. The price of thin rice was down a few cents to one cent. Yangdujian was generally weak, the price of Bukejian rice was weak by a few cents, the price of Baiyuan was generally stable, the price of early rice fell slightly by one cent, and the prices of all other goods showed weakness.</p>
<p>[South of Shanghai] The source of goods from various merchants yesterday was similar to before, with a total of over 50 boats arriving, carrying 12,700 to 12,800 shi of goods. Thin rice still accounted for over 30 boats. Due to continuous small reports in Tianjin telegrams, buyers from other provinces were hesitant. Only the Qingdao, Yantai, and Qinhuangdao merchants handled over 2,000 bags. However, the local street sales market was active, and the situation was generally stable. The price of thin rice was neither good nor bad. Thick glutinous rice continued to rise by one cent due to the scarcity of goods, but medium-grade goods were slightly better by a few cents. Duyangjian was similar to the glutinous rice market. Yinyuan rose again by varying amounts beyond a cent.</p>
<p>Large Volume of Foreign Sesame Transactions, Soybean Market Returns to Tightness</p>
<p>Yesterday, a large volume of foreign sesame transactions opened, and prices rose by 30 cents. The Central Trust Bureau handled 600 tons, and Jardine Matheson traded 500 tons. Prices opened from 14.925 yuan to 14.95 yuan. The market trend seems to be continuously bullish. The soybean market softened uniformly yesterday morning due to a sudden drop of 20 cents in Dalian. The selling pressure in the market was excessive, causing transactions to stop abruptly. In the afternoon, the Dalian telegrams came in and jumped over a cent, and the market immediately became active. Oil mills handled ten cars of Sipingjie beans, two cars of Bengbu beans, and one car of Linhuaiguan beans. Other beans were traded within the local street, including 1,300 to 1,400 bags from Fuzhou and other regions. Prices fell by five cents to one cent compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Fabric</h3>
<p>Warehouse stocks of coarse yarn are plentiful; recent yarn prices are under pressure; factories are running at full capacity; spot goods are now more readily available than before.</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the downward trend is intensifying. This is because warehouses report abundant stocks of yarn, exceeding 4,000 bales. This quantity of cotton yarn will not be easily sold off in the short term, thus putting pressure on the current market. Distant contracts are being drawn into the vortex. However, Changfeng continues to diligently pull in yarn for a certain client, in very large quantities. The future situation may temporarily see a period of fluctuation, as factories have already increased production to full capacity, and spot goods are much more readily available than before.</p>
<p>Many profit-taking closures in listed yarn</p>
<p>Listed yarn prices opened lower across the board in the previous market, primarily because while the Osaka Sanpin yarn market rose this month, distant months fell, leading to wavering confidence. Moreover, raw cotton is very weak, and the situation for foreign cotton is bleak. At the same time, spot yarn trading is becoming sluggish, and the market is increasingly slack. The market fell steadily throughout the day. In reality, many had seen continuous price increases, prompting bulls to take profits. However, Changfeng absorbed a large quantity. As a result, listed yarn prices for all months fell by 2.5 to 3.5 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon session, Osaka Sanpin yarn saw a rebound for the current month, while distant months remained flat, slightly boosting confidence. Short covering was more active, and market prices rebounded.

<p>Floating shorts covering for profit; cotton steadies slightly in afternoon</p>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, slightly stabilizing the market. However, overseas Indian and American cotton markets are weak, leading to more closures of floating positions. Current cotton demand from factories remains sluggish. However, some saw profit-taking covering due to the price drop of 1 yuan. The afternoon appeared slightly firmer.</p>
<p>Listed cotton down another 3-4 jiao</p>
<p>Listed cotton opened lower across all months in the previous market, and the downward trend was particularly strong. With mixed movements in American cotton prices and a strong downward trend in Indian cotton, confidence was further dampened, and more bulls closed positions, loosening the market considerably. As a result, listed cotton prices for all months fell by 0.5 to 0.55 yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. A slight rebound was seen in the afternoon session. After two consecutive days of decline, profit-takers covered shorts, and the market slightly improved. Consequently, prices for all months rose by 0.2 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Sold: Zhenda 2,200 dan, Mingde 1,500 dan, Yuda 2,600 dan, Jifeng 1,900 dan, Heyu 6,400 dan, Xingchang 1,100 dan, Fengtai 6,600 dan, Dachangcheng 1,800 dan, Changfeng 3,600 dan, Runkang 14,000 dan, Kangda 1,100 dan, Fukang 1,000 dan, Xinhua 3,900 dan.

The day's high and low prices are listed below.</p>
<p>Very sluggish spot cotton consumption</p>
<p>Current cotton demand from factories is stagnant. Sources: Yao flower - 1,800 bales, Tong flower - 1,280 bales.</p>
<p>Indian cotton declines more sharply</p>
<p>Yesterday's opening of the American cotton market was mediocre. Prices for all months ranged from a decrease of 4 points to an increase of 1 point. Dealers were hesitant to buy or sell until a detailed cotton handling method was available. Subsequently, bulls closed positions and cotton farmers hedged sales, but both were absorbed by dealers. Labor unrest caused buyers to hesitate. Spot cotton was quiet, while the cloth market was firm with many inquiries. The closing price was stable. Spot prices were unchanged, and futures prices rose 1 point to fall 4 points. Spot British cotton fell 2 points, while futures prices remained unchanged. Indian cotton initially weakened due to short selling, but then strengthened as the stock market rose and speculators bought in. Eventually, the market price softened again due to bull closures and cotton farmer hedging. Pingguoer fell by 3 to 2.25 rupees, Aomula fell by 3 to 3.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 2.75 rupees. Original telegram recorded (5th telegram).</p>
<p>According to the Bombay telegram, the opening price forecast for the 6th: Bailuoxi was 228.5 rupees, Aomula was 205.75 rupees, and Pingguoer was 177.25 rupees, all up by 1 rupee.</p>

<h3>Cheng Ying and Gongsun Chujiu</h3>
<p>— Bi Yi</p>
<p>—“A great man should die meaningfully. What's the point of dying in vain?" said Cheng Ying.</p>
<p>When Duke Wen of Jin was a prince, he was forced to flee his country and drift abroad for nineteen years. He relied entirely on the strength of his followers and ministers to return to his country and become a hegemon. Duke Wen chose Zhao Shuai, the most outstanding in talent and the greatest in merit among his followers, to be the state chancellor and gave him the title of Yuan Dafu. Zhao Shuai was an extremely benevolent man, truly loving the people as his own children and regarding their suffering as his own. Therefore, the people of Jin all liked him very much, saying he was as lovable as the winter sun.</p>
<p>Zhao Shuai's home was in Yuan City. When Zhao Shuai had free time, he often liked to wear commoners' clothes and go alone to the countryside to inquire about who was in trouble, so he could help them. One day, he went out again to inquire and saw that his people were living in peace and working happily, and that no one was in distress needed his help. He was very happy, chatting and laughing with the farmers and shepherds he met on the road as he returned. Therefore, he was delayed for some time, and by the time the lamps were lit, he had not yet reached home. As wisps of smoke disappeared, and the setting sun suddenly vanished, Zhao Shuai, with a few strands of white beard, walked alone in the vast twilight, inevitably feeling somewhat lonely. Thinking of his harmonious and lovable family, he wished he could fly back, but his old bones were no match for his will. He thought of flying, but they couldn't even run, dragging him along slowly.</p>
<p>The older he got, the greater his achievements. He cherished his valuable experience, so he never felt that being old was sad. Now, because he couldn't walk with energy, he began to hate being old. He licked the few remaining teeth in his mouth and sighed, "How many years does a seventy-year-old man have left!" He suddenly changed his mind again, "Regardless of how many years are left, one should live well. What's the use of a useless person, even if they live to be a thousand years old? A useful person, a few decades are enough to be useful. From now on, I will try my best to use my energy to serve the country, and at the same time promote younger generations to continue my military career."</p>
<p>He had just thought of some plans when a burst of crying interrupted his train of thought. He borrowed a torch from a farmhouse and followed the crying into the woods, where he found a child about to hang himself. Zhao Shuai, seeing this situation, immediately became sad and frightened. With trembling hands, he raised the torch to illuminate the child's face and was speechless for a moment, thinking, "I always thought my governance was quite effective, but I didn't expect it to be so bad—in my rule, even children don't want to live! This child, with his small body and tender face, I guess his age must be younger than Shuo's grandson (Shuo is Shuai's eldest grandson, Dun's son)." So Zhao Shuai put the torch on the ground, hugged the child, and comforted him, "My dear, don't be afraid, I'm here for you. I am Grandpa Zhao (the people of Yuan Yi all call Zhao Shuai Grandpa Zhao, and everyone knows who he is when they talk about Grandpa Zhao). Tell me what troubles you have!" As soon as the child heard it was Grandpa Zhao, he immediately fell into his arms like he had met a relative, crying softly. At this time, the torch on the ground had burned out, leaving only a pile of glowing red embers. The evening wind blew through the forest, and it was cold all around. Zhao Shuai was afraid the child would catch a cold, so he hugged him even tighter, using his sleeves to wipe away his tears. He waited for the child to stop crying before asking him, "How old are you this year?" The child replied, "Sixteen years old." Zhao Shuai was surprised that he was not as tall as Zhao Shuo but was two years older than Zhao Shuo. He said, "Oh! So you are my Shuo's grandson's older brother." Zhao Shuai then asked about his name, address, and the reason for seeking death.</p>
<p>It turned out that this child, whose surname was Cheng and given name Ying, lived not far from the Zhao family. When he was fourteen years old, his parents unfortunately both died, leaving behind a sister who was less than one year old. The family was too poor to afford a wet nurse, so Cheng Ying had to raise her alone, feeding her gruel and milk. Cheng Ying suffered a lot to raise his sister until she could walk away from his embrace. Unexpectedly, one day, Cheng Ying was busy and neglected to watch over her. His sister walked out of the house and fell down a very high slope. By the time Cheng Ying noticed, his sister was already dead. Cheng Ying thought it was his fault, so he wanted to commit suicide to be with his sister. Zhao Shuai saw that he was so righteous at such a young age and liked him very much. He said many words of comfort to him and persuaded him to stop.</p>
<p>At that time, Zhao Shuai's family, seeing that Zhao Shuai had not returned late at night, were very worried. They sent several teams of people to search for him separately. It was Zhao Dun who happened to find Zhao Shuai in the woods. Zhao Shuai therefore handed Cheng Ying over to him and told him to treat Cheng Ying as his own son.</p>
<p>Not long after Cheng Ying arrived at the Zhao family, Zhao Shuai died. Duke Xiang of Jin (Duke Wen's son) considered Zhao Dun wise and appointed him to succeed his father in governing the state. Zhao Dun's heart was as benevolent as Zhao Shuai's, but his appearance was more serious, making people afraid to get close to him casually. Therefore, people at the time said he was as terrible as the summer sun. In the second year that Zhao Dun served as state chancellor, Duke Xiang died, and the crown prince ascended the throne, becoming Duke Ling. At that time, Duke Ling was still a child, and all matters relied on Zhao Dun to manage. Later, Duke Ling grew up and became increasingly cruel and unprincipled. He would even kill a cook if bear paws were not cooked properly. Zhao Dun often had to remonstrate with him, but Duke Ling was unhappy and conspired with the treacherous minister Tu Anjia to assassinate Zhao Dun. Although the assassination was unsuccessful, Zhao Dun was forced to leave. Unexpectedly, Zhao Dun had only gone halfway and had not yet left the borders of Jin when a revolution suddenly broke out in the Jin court. A clansman of Zhao Dun's named Zhao Chuan killed Duke Ling. Zhao Dun was afraid that there would be no one in the court and that the chaos would escalate, so he had to rush back and establish Duke Cheng, Duke Xiang's younger brother, as the ruler of Jin. Duke Cheng still allowed Zhao Dun to serve as state chancellor and even married one of his elder sisters to Zhao Shuo as his wife. By the time Duke Jing (Duke Cheng's son) ascended the throne, Zhao Dun had served as chancellor to four rulers. He was highly respected and virtuous, and the court and the public looked up to him. Everyone thought it was a great honor to come from the Zhao family, so guests from all over came from afar. Zhao Dun selected and accommodated the virtuous, and the number of people was considerable.</p>
<p>This group of peaceful guests, when they had nothing to do during the day, besides reading books, fencing, drinking, and playing pot-throwing games, liked to gather in groups of three or five, sit knee to knee, and discuss people's merits and demerits. Among the guests, there was one Gongsun Chujiu, who was recognized by everyone as a model hero. His physique was very handsome, with a tender heart and chivalrous spirit, sharp eyes, and meticulous care. He was best at helping people resolve difficulties. His temperament was straightforward and sincere, and he was good at speaking. Moreover, he always kept his word and never shirked responsibility. Therefore, he was the most popular person in the Zhao family. As for Cheng Ying, as soon as he arrived at the Zhao family, he studied and lived with Zhao Shuo and became very familiar with the Zhao family's relatives. In Zhao Dun's mind, he was more like a son than a guest. Zhao Dun often held large banquets for his guests, with Cheng Ying always at the end of the table and Gongsun Chujiu always at the head. Zhao Dun did this because he thought he was "cherishing his relatives" and "respecting the worthy" in the right way. Unexpectedly, people with shallow minds misunderstood Zhao Dun's good intentions, thinking that Zhao Dun valued Gongsun Chujiu and looked down on Cheng Ying, leading everyone to not treat Cheng Ying with respect and to only like to gossip about him. Cheng Ying was very thin and weak, with a low voice and an attitude that was very much like a woman's. Some frivolous people, knowing that he had taken care of his sister when he was young, secretly called him Mother Cheng. Cheng Ying's person was really inconsistent with his appearance. He had great ambition and a generous heart, and he never liked to argue with people. Only when he heard people call him Mother Cheng did he feel uncomfortable, thinking of the pain of his sister's death. However, his non-resistant expression of discomfort not only failed to stop the slander but also invited more insults. He was originally a smart person, but because he did not like to express himself, and people were also deceived by his appearance and were unwilling to bother getting to know him, everyone misunderstood him as a result. Among the hundreds of guests, only Gongsun Chujiu knew that Cheng Ying was not ordinary and was willing to look at him differently. At first, Gongsun Chujiu had a "fighting for the underdog" attitude, pitying Cheng Ying for being isolated and bullied, and specially lowered himself to befriend him. Unexpectedly, as soon as Gongsun Chujiu got to know him, he discovered that he was a righteous man and sighed that he was not as good as him. From then on, Gongsun Chujiu often defended Cheng Ying and said good things about him, but because everyone already had preconceived notions, very few people believed that Cheng Ying had any good qualities.</p>
<p>In the second year of Duke Jing's reign, Zhao Dun died, and his son Shuo inherited his position. At this time, Tu Anjia was again favored by Duke Jing, and Duke Jing appointed him as the Minister of Justice. Tu Anjia had always held a grudge because his assassination of Zhao Dun during Duke Ling's reign had failed. Now that he had gained power, he wanted to harm the Zhao family to avenge his old grievances. So he gathered the grandees behind Duke Jing and Zhao Shuo's backs and, in front of everyone, pretended to cry bitterly, saying, "Duke Ling died so miserably! How can we not avenge him? Although Zhao Chuan killed Duke Ling, it was actually Zhao Dun who instigated it. Zhao Dun killed the ruler as a subject, and his descendants are now high-ranking officials in the court. How can we punish the crime and convince the people? Please execute Zhao Shuo!" The grandees knew that Tu Anjia was slandering people, but they were afraid of his power and did not dare to say a word of justice. Among them, there was one virtuous grandee whose surname was Han and given name Jue. He was promoted by Zhao Dun. He was afraid that people would say that he was biased towards the Zhao family because of his gratitude, so he originally wanted to avoid suspicion and not speak. But seeing that everyone was shrinking back and avoiding trouble, he had no choice but to stand up and protest, "When Duke Ling met with the assassin, Zhao Dun was outside. The former ruler thought he was innocent, so he did not execute Zhao Dun. Now you want to execute his descendants, which is not the former ruler's intention. Hiding it from the ruler and wrongly executing good people is the work of rebellious and wicked subjects. Rebellious and wicked subjects are subject to the constant punishment of the country. Please be careful." Tu Anjia knew that Han Jue was a lone voice and did not listen to him. Han Jue had no choice but to run to Zhao's house and tell Zhao Shuo, "Tu Anjia is determined to harm you. You should flee!" Zhao Shuo had grown accustomed to living a comfortable life under the protection of his wise father. He did not understand how to adapt to changing circumstances. He thought for a long time before answering, "Shuo has received great kindness from the country and really cannot bear to flee. In the past, Duke Ling wanted to kill my father, but my father refused to die and fled, resulting in the evil name of a ruler killer. Even today, some people want to use this evil name to execute his descendants. Now, if I were to take the same path as my father, I would surely get another evil name. Let me die then, Zhao Shuo is determined not to flee or resist." After a while, Zhao Shuo said to Han Jue with tears in his eyes, "If you can ensure that the Zhao family does not die out, I will not regret dying." Han Jue agreed to him, came back, and pretended to be sick and asked for leave so that he would not come out.</p>
<p>Gongsun Chujiu heard the news that Tu Anjia wanted to harm the Zhao family and cried as he urged Zhao Shuo to prepare, but Zhao Shuo did not listen. Cheng Ying knew that Zhao Shuo was hopeless. He did not speak to him, but only advised Zhao Shuo's wife to hide, because she was a palace mistress. Once she was in the palace, Tu Anjia would definitely not dare to harm her. At this time, the wife was already pregnant. In order to preserve an heir for the Zhao family, she had no choice but to escape to the palace and rely on Duke Cheng's wife. The guests and retainers of the Zhao family, seeing that a great disaster was about to befall the Zhao family, were all afraid of getting themselves involved. In less than a day, they fled one after another. The next day, Tu Anjia personally led troops to besiege the Zhao family at the lower palace and killed the entire Zhao family. Afterwards, Anjia checked the corpses and discovered that the palace mistress's corpse was missing. Knowing that she had entered the palace to hide, he dared not pursue her because of Duke Cheng's wife's pregnancy test. He only secretly sent people to monitor her. Because Anjia also knew that the palace mistress had a posthumous child, he was afraid of leaving a root for revenge and planned to kill the child as soon as it was born.</p>
<p>Since the Zhao family's tragedy occurred, Gongsun Chujiu had hidden himself, secretly devising a way to take revenge. He thought that Cheng Ying must have died a martyr's death and was sighing that he had died too early, missing a good helper. Unexpectedly, at this moment, Cheng Ying found him. The two men met and cried loudly. After a while, Gongsun Chujiu stopped crying and asked Cheng Ying, "I thought you had already died in the Lower Palace disaster. Why didn't you die?" Cheng Ying replied, "A great man should die meaningfully. What's the point of dying in vain? I know that you are now devising a way to take revenge, but I don't think that just taking revenge is enough. What has been done for the Zhao family? Tu Anjia's main purpose is to make the Zhao family extinct. We must ensure that the Zhao family has an heir so that the Zhao family's descendants can take revenge themselves. Only then will we have done a proper thing to repay both kindness and revenge. Now Shuo's wife has a posthumous child and is hiding in the palace. If, by luck, she gives birth to a good child in the future, our plan can be realized. There are many things that will require us in the future, so why rush to die?" Gongsun Chujiu very much agreed with Cheng Ying's insightful opinion and agreed to devise a way to protect the Zhao family's orphan.</p>
<p>Two months later, Qu Shuo's wife gave birth to a very healthy baby boy in the palace. Seeing that Zhao Shuo had been weak and mistaken himself, she specially named the child Wu. She was also afraid that Tu Anjia would send someone to harm him, so she hid him and raised him, falsely saying that he had died as soon as he was born. Anjia did not believe it and sent many people into the palace to search. In a hurry, the wife was at a loss and had no choice but to hide the baby in her crotch, secretly telling him, "If the Zhao family should die out, then cry. If they should not die out, then do not make a sound!" At this time, Zhao Wu was sleeping soundly, and as if he understood human affairs, he did not make a sound and was able to escape danger.</p>
<p>Cheng Ying knew about this matter and quickly found Gongsun Chujiu to discuss it, "The Zhao orphan is being raised in the palace, but it is not a foolproof plan after all. Anjia will search once and not find him, but he will definitely search again in the future. What should we do?" Gongsun Chujiu thought silently for a while, then asked Cheng Ying, "Which is more difficult, establishing an orphan or dying?" Cheng Ying replied, "Dying is easy, establishing an orphan is difficult." Gongsun Chujiu said, "The Zhao family's former ruler treated you well, so you should do the difficult thing! As for me, I am willing to do the easy thing. Please die first." The two agreed, so they devised a way to find a baby who was seriously ill and about to die, dressed him in small, embroidered clothes, and had Gongsun Chujiu take him to Shouyang Mountain to hide. Then Cheng Ying personally went to Tu Anjia and confessed, "I have been in the Zhao family for twenty or thirty years, and Zhao Shuo and his son have never treated me well for even a day. Why should I wrong myself for their sake and offend Minister Tu? Let me tell you, Zhao's wife gave birth to a boy in the palace, and Gongsun Chujiu has already secretly taken him out. They are now hiding in Shouyang Mountain and plan to go to Qin during the day." Tu Anjia had long heard that among Zhao's guests, there were two people named Gongsun Chujiu and Cheng Ying, who were both good and bad. Therefore, he believed Cheng Ying's words as soon as he heard them. Tu Anjia then personally led his troops to follow Cheng Ying to find Zhao's orphan. Sure enough, they found him in the mountains. Gongsun Chujiu pretended to be furious and cursed Cheng Ying, "Cheng Ying, you are really a villain! You couldn't die in the Lower Palace disaster, so you discussed with me to hide the Zhao family's orphan, but now you are betraying me! Even if you can't help to establish Zhao's orphan, can you bear to harm him?" Gongsun Chujiu cried as he hugged the baby and begged Tu Anjia, "Heaven! Heaven! What crime has Zhao's orphan committed? Please let him live and just kill Chujiu!" Tu Anjia did not agree and immediately drew his sword and killed Chujiu and the orphan together. Zhao's old guests, who were scattered everywhere, heard this news and all said, "I knew long ago that Cheng Ying was a villain and Gongsun Chujiu was a righteous man. Now the facts have proven it!"

<h3>"Collected Discussions on the Construction of a China-Based Culture" (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ying Fu</p>
<p>The Collected Discussions on the Construction of a China-Based Culture, published by the Cultural Construction Monthly Society, can be said to be a book of great significance and value. The subject discussed throughout the collection is how to construct Chinese culture; it is divided into two factions to discuss the above question, namely: the "China-Based" faction and the "Complete Westernization" or anti-"China-Based" faction. A book like this, which takes the major issue of Chinese cultural construction as its subject of discussion, can truly be called an innovation in our country's academic, intellectual, and publishing circles. Now, as readers, let us talk about this collection of discussions from both the editorial and content aspects.</p>
<p>According to the editor Fan Zhongyun in the preface, the origin of the editing of the Collected Discussions on the Construction of a China-Based Culture was due to the declaration of the construction of a China-Based culture published by the Shanghai Ten Professors on January 10, 1935, which triggered the discussion articles. The Cultural Construction Monthly Society then "selected those that could have their own systematic claims from more than one million words of articles, totaling 300,000 words" and edited them. From this, it can be seen that this collection of discussions is the essence of the above-mentioned major issue's discussion articles. As for the editing method of this book, we can talk about it below.</p>
<p>The entire book, including the editor's preface, contains a total of forty-nine articles of current commentary. In terms of the order of arrangement, the editor divides the articles into nine categories: first, the declaration of the construction of a China-Based culture; second, what is culture; third, what is China-Based; fourth, China-Based and not adhering to the old; fifth, China-Based and not blindly following; sixth, China-Based and Chinese learning as fundamental structure, with Western learning for practical application; seventh, how to construct a China-Based culture; eighth, general answers and their criticisms; ninth, Westernization, globalization, and China-Based. All questions about the construction of a China-Based culture, whether important or minor, direct or indirect, can be found in this collection of discussions. This cannot but be attributed to the suitability and perfection of the editing method.</p>
<p>Next, let us extract three articles from the forty-nine discussion articles as representatives of the entire collection's content, and give a brief introduction and examination. For example, Chen Lifu's Culture and the Construction of Chinese Culture, which is at the beginning of the collection, can be said to be an important article and the foundation of the entire collection's discussion articles. At the beginning of the article, Chen explained the meaning of culture, civilization, and culture; moreover, he explained in detail that the so-called culture must go through seven distinct stages, namely, the sincerity mentioned in the Doctrine of the Mean, "If there is sincerity, it will take shape; if it takes shape, it will become manifest; if it becomes manifest, it will become clear; if it becomes clear, it will move; if it moves, it will change; if it changes, it will transform." Then, he quoted Mr. Sun Yat-sen's saying, "The reason why human beings in ancient and modern times must make continuous efforts is because they want to survive. Because human beings must have uninterrupted survival, society can have uninterrupted evolution," to confirm and expand the meaning of the above-mentioned culture. Moreover, he explained in passing that the Chinese Kuomintang's adjustment of politics is the work of civilizational construction; furthermore, he pointed out the content and method of the construction of a China-Based culture.

He is the first person in the Far East to receive this honor. Yesterday afternoon at four o'clock, Archbishop Cai Ning, the Papal Nuncio to China, representing Pope Pius XI, personally conducted the investiture ceremony for Mr. Lu. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Over a Thousand Guests in Attendance</p>
<p>Mr. Lu's investiture was marked by a joint invitation sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, Wang Xiaolai, the Local Self-Government Association, Du Yuesheng, the Federation of Charity Organizations, Wang Yiting, the International Problem Research Association, Guo Bingwen, the Shipping Guild, Yu Qiaqing, the Bankers' Association, Chen Guangfu, the Money Guild, Qin Runqing, the China International Famine Relief Commission, Song Hanzhang, the Catholic Action Association, Zhu Zhiyao, and others. Guests from all walks of life were invited to witness the event. Attendees included Mayor Wu's representative Geng Jiaji, Ambassador to the United States Wang Zhengting, Garrison Commander Yang Hu, Secretary Wang Zhinan, Municipal Government Counselor Zhou Yongneng, Section Chief Li Dachao, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Health Bureau Li Ting'an, Police Commissioner Cai Jinjun, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau Xu Peihuang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Zhou Jue, Italian Ambassador Aloisi, consuls from countries such as England, France, and Belgium, Bishop Yu, Bishop Hu, representatives from various public organizations, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Yiting, Lin Kanghou, Yan Fuqing, Shi Shengzhi, Guan Jiongzhi, and other guests, totaling over a thousand people. The Zhengxiu Middle School band and the police band were also present to perform music.</p>
<p>Hall Decorations and Ceremony Order</p>
<p>The ceremony hall was located in the main auditorium of Zhengxiu Middle School on Guohuo Road in the Nanshi district. A pine and cypress archway was erected at the entrance, brightly illuminated with electric lights. The flags of the Party and the nation were crossed at the top, fluttering in the breeze. Upon entering the hall, there were over a thousand seats for the guests. Pots of fresh flowers were arranged in the hall, with red and green silks reflecting brightly. The front was the stage, with the orchestra playing below. On the stage, there were fifty to sixty special seats, and images of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, St. Joseph, and a portrait of the current Pope with his autograph were displayed. The arrangement was extremely simple and elegant. The order of the ceremony was as follows: 1. Music, 2. Opening remarks by representatives of public organizations, 3. Music, 4. Conferral speech by Archbishop Cai Ning, representative of the Pope, 5. Speech by Mayor Wu, 6. Speech by the American Ambassador, 7. Speech by Bishop Hu, 8. Speech by Bishop Yu, 9. Speeches by guests, 10. Singing of celebratory songs, 11. Mr. Lu Bohong's speech of thanks, including a report on the twenty-five-year history of the New Pu Yu Tang, 12. Music concludes the ceremony.</p>
<p>Speech by Wang Yiting, Representative of Organizations</p>
<p>After the ceremony began, Wang Yiting, representing various organizations, delivered a speech, stating briefly that Mr. Lu Bohong has strived in charitable endeavors, benefiting the poor. The Pu Yu Tang, which he founded, has been established for twenty-five years and has saved countless people. Mr. Lu is a leader of the Catholic Church, and the Pope, recognizing his zeal for saving the world, has awarded him the title of Knight Commander with Star of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Sylvester to commend his virtue. Various organizations in this city have jointly invited people from all walks of life to witness this event, in order to highlight his benevolence and offer congratulations.</p>
<p>Investiture Speech by Archbishop Cai Ning</p>
<p>Subsequently, Archbishop Cai Ning, representing the Pope, conferred the honor, bestowing three gold necklaces, knightly robes, and a sword. After the investiture, he delivered a speech in Latin, briefly stating that he was very honored to participate in the ceremony and confer the honor on behalf of the Pope. The honor consists of three objects, signifying closeness to the Pope as a sword-bearer. This honor is truly the result of Mr. Lu's faith and love. Mr. Lu has been serving the poor for twenty-five years. Humanity must strive and sacrifice in order to succeed. He hopes that Mr. Lu will continue his efforts to fulfill the hopes of the Pope and God.</p>
<p>Significance of the Title Knight Commander with Star</p>
<p>The general meaning of the title Knight Commander with Star of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Sylvester is that this title was established in 1555 by Pope Paul IV and has been bestowed by successive Popes on kings of France and Germany, and other monarchs. This title is one of the highest honors of the Holy See. It is usually given to distinguished individuals from various countries who have made special contributions and hold a title of nobility. The Holy See does not lightly confer it upon people, as the recipient can enter and leave the palace at any time and serve the Pope. Currently, there are only seven or eight people in the world who hold this title. Mr. Lu Bohong's receipt of this honor is the first in the Far East, and it is also an honor for our country internationally.</p>
<p>Congratulatory Speech by Mayor Wu's Representative</p>
<p>Geng Jiaji, representing Mayor Wu, delivered a congratulatory speech, saying, "On the banks of the Huangpu River stands a magnificent building, sheltering over three thousand elderly, weak, poor, and sick. It provides education and care for them, and has done so for twenty-five years. Who oversees it? Mr. Lu Bohong. When he first founded it, he faced great difficulties. He planned and managed it, not avoiding hardships. The scale is grand, benefiting our people. He provides medicine and cares for the sick, touching the hearts of millions. He is diligent and tireless, his reputation shaking Shanghai. In all good deeds, he strives to be first, exhausting his efforts to contribute to God. The Holy See recognizes his diligence and hard work. He is adorned with the robes and swords, honoring his person. This great honor is unprecedented. Today, it is especially magnificent, surpassing all others. As the years turn and the nation is renewed, a grand ceremony is held, and China and foreign countries rejoice together. Our Archbishop bestows grace on behalf of the Pope. The incense burners follow in procession, and the clergy are like clouds. Officials gather, celebrating this auspicious day, bringing glory to our Chinese people and spreading this pure fragrance. I wish you longevity, endless honor, and that your blessings spread throughout the land, bringing spring to the earth. Respectfully wishing you well, Wu Tiecheng, Mayor of Shanghai."</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting and Others Deliver Successive Speeches</p>
<p>Ambassador Wang Zhengting delivered a speech, briefly stating that he was extremely honored to participate in the ceremony. The Pope rarely bestows honors, and it is especially rare in our country. Mr. Lu serves humanity, loves others as himself, and his charitable work is like planting trees. The charitable works founded by Mr. Lu have flourishing branches and leaves, all thanks to his proper management, which has resulted in what we see today. Subsequently, Bishop Hu Jiliang and Bishop Yu Bin delivered speeches and sang congratulatory songs.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Bohong Delivers a Speech of Thanks</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Bohong delivered a speech of thanks, saying, "Today, I am deeply grateful and honored to receive the Knight Commander with Star of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Sylvester bestowed by Archbishop Cai on behalf of the Pope, and to have Mayor Wu, other officials, Bishop Hu, Bishop Yu, Bishop Tian, priests, and distinguished guests grace us with their presence. I believe that the title Knight Commander with Star of the Pontifical Equestrian Order of St. Sylvester is extremely solemn in the Holy See. I am fortunate to receive this honor. Throughout my life, I have devoted myself to society with sincerity in my faith, doing my best in all public welfare and charitable causes that benefit people. This is merely the result of being nurtured by religious teachings and fulfilling my personal duty. The Pope's special bestowal of this honor is precisely to care for China and bless our nation. I will only strive harder to repay the Pope's great benevolence. In addition to gratitude, I ask Archbishop Cai to convey my sincere sentiments to the Pope. I am exceedingly grateful."</p>
<p>History and Current Status of the New Pu Yu Tang</p>
<p>After Mr. Lu finished his speech, he reported on the history and current status of the New Pu Yu Tang. The Shanghai New Pu Yu Tang was originally located in Banduanjing in the city and was founded in the fourth year of the Tongzhi reign (Qing Dynasty). It housed approximately four to five hundred disabled orphans and women. Later, due to the simple buildings and the increasing number of people, it was insufficient. In the first year of the Republic of China, the local authorities and charitable organizations jointly recommended me to be responsible for the reorganization. The site was moved to over a hundred acres of the Puan Pavilion public cemetery outside the Dananmen. At that time, funding was lacking, and I advanced a large sum of money to start building new houses. By March of the second year of the Republic of China, the new houses were completed. Catholic nuns were invited to take on all internal affairs on a voluntary basis. Subsequently, more buildings were added. Now there are more than twenty courtyards, providing care for more than three thousand two hundred men, women, old people, poor and sick people, disabled orphans, and infants. Food, clothing, and housing are all provided free of charge. Over the past twenty-five years, a total of 110,000 people have been cared for in the hall. More than 60,000 patients have recovered and left the hall. Outpatient medical treatment and medicine have been provided to more than 2.3 million people. Income from municipal government agencies, church groups, and Chinese and foreign philanthropists has been about 3.4 million yuan, while expenses have been more than 3.7 million yuan. After offsetting income and expenses, there is a deficit of about 300,000 yuan. This debt is currently being borrowed and advanced by myself. The hall is the largest charitable organization in the country. After his speech, tea and champagne were served until six o'clock, when the event concluded.</p>
<p>Two Organizations Jointly Celebrate</p>
<p>The Catholic Action Association of China and the Silver Jubilee (25th anniversary) of the Pu Yu Tang were jointly celebrated for three days (6th, 7th, and 8th). Mass was held in the morning and blessings were given in the afternoon. On the first day, Archbishop Cai Ning presided over the event at the Dongjiadu Catholic Church. On the second day, Bishop Yu presided over the event at the Saint Pu Yu Tang. On the third day, Bishop Hu presided over the event at the Sacred Heart Hospital.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders Maritime Affairs Bureau to Convene Relevant Shipping Merchants</h3>
<p>Discussing Promoting Cooperation in the Shipping Industry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications received an order from the Ministry of Communications with the document number "Hangchuan Zi" 4856, which stated: "It has been reported that Han Yimin, Chairman of the Shanghai Inland River Steamer Industry Association, sent a telegram stating, 'Having read the newspaper yesterday, we respectfully know that the measures for promoting cooperation in the shipping industry were promulgated and implemented by your Ministry on the 9th of last month. At this time of difficulty for the shipping industry, cooperation among the industry is the only good medicine for maintaining the shipping industry. The cooperation measures promulgated by your Ministry are well-planned and the methods are appropriate. Once implemented, they will surely yield good results, which all shipping merchants are encouraged by. However, the 'Registration Rules for the Steamer Industry' and the 'Supervisory Regulations for the Steamer Industry' are closely related to the 'Law on Promoting Cooperation in the Shipping Industry.' If they are not implemented at the same time, I am afraid it will be difficult to achieve the desired effect. The association has not received a clear order, so the group cannot be released. Therefore, we especially telegraphically request instructions. Furthermore, the Shanghai-Wuxi and Jiangyin-Wujin-Yixing-Liyang (Shenxi), Shanghai-Pinghu and Jiaxing-Xiashi-Haining (Shenping), and Shanghai-Wuxing and Linghu-Xinshi (Shenhu) routes are overcrowded with scheduled liners, and supply exceeds demand. The urgent need for reasonable cooperation is truly imminent. The association intends to request your Ministry to telegraphically instruct the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau to guide the association to deliberate on cooperation measures on the above routes, in order to meet the expectations of your Ministry in promoting cooperation in the shipping industry. We respectfully telegraph this request and ask for your approval.' Upon receiving the report, it is hereby ordered that the Bureau shall follow the measures for promoting cooperation in the shipping industry, convene the Association and relevant shipping merchants, properly request them to proceed step by step, and report the handling situation. This order.' After receiving the order, the Bureau has already forwarded it to the Shanghai Steamer Industry Association and relevant shipping merchants for handling."</p>
<h3>Director Zhang of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Inland River Steamer Bureau Has New Plans</h3>
<p>It is Said That There is Much Hope This Year</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's inland river steamer routes have not developed in recent years due to the depressed market and the poor rural economy. Therefore, at the end of last year, there were rumors of suspending operations and reorganizing. It is now learned that this is not the case. Only the director was changed from the head office to Zhang Yizeng. The internal staff remains the same. After Director Zhang took office on January 1st, he immediately began to carry out the instructions of the head office and began to reorganize. Currently, the Bureau has sixteen inland river routes, including Shensu (Shanghai-Suzhou), Shenhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou), Hangzhen (Hangzhou-Zhenhai), Shenjiao (Shanghai-Jiaoxing), Shenxia (Shanghai-Xiashi), Zhenqing (Zhenhai-Qingpu), Dongxingshao (Dongting-Xingshao), Xi (Wuxi), Li (Liyang), Suhang (Suzhou-Hangzhou), Suqin (Suzhou-Qinpu), and Xicheng (Wuxi-Chengxiang), with more than twenty steamers, including Hengji, He'an, Heping, Jianyuan, Xiangfu, Taichang, Hekuan, Hengtong, Dashun, Ruishun, and Lihang. According to Director Zhang, the Bureau's annual expenses are about 40,000 yuan. This year, with the good harvest in the inland and the market improving, it should be able to obtain a considerable surplus after the reorganization.</p>
<h3>Qiongya Authorities Planning to Develop Industry</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Hainan Island is isolated in a corner of the sea and is close to the tropics. Although it is rich in products, it has not been noticed by the Chinese people, so its rich treasures are abandoned in the ground and have not been developed. Recently, since the Guangdong situation was settled, the provincial government has been determined to reorganize and invited Mr. Song Ziwen, a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Commission, to go to Hainan on his way south to investigate and plan everything. At this time when national construction is actively underway, the recent situation of the island is of great concern to the Chinese people. Yesterday, according to a gentleman from Qiong coming to Shanghai, the island has suffered years of war, banditry, and disasters, and the residents have been resentful and oppressed. The situation is very miserable. Since Chen Jitang stepped down and the Guangdong government was reorganized, Huang Qiang took office as the Commissioner of the Qiongya Administrative Inspectorate and concurrently as the Commander of the Security Forces. The atmosphere began to change. Mr. Huang is wise and capable, and has made many plans for matters that should be promoted and reformed in Qiongya, refreshing all government affairs and deeply winning the support and love of the Qiong people. After Mr. Song Ziwen personally inspected, overseas Chinese organizations established companies and sent representatives to Qiong to visit the local officials. People who came to negotiate development came one after another. Commissioner Huang appointed Mr. Huang Hu to set up the Qiongya Industrial Bureau to be in charge of the matter. As for how to develop, the authorities are carefully planning. With the abundance of resources in Qiongya, the prospects for development are truly unlimited.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Issues Order to Shipping Merchants Restricting Purchase of Foreign Ships</h3>
<p>Those Ordered Before the End of This Month May Be Approved for Filing</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has made accommodations regarding the procedures and time for restricting the purchase of foreign ships. Those who have ordered them before the end of this month may be approved for filing. Yesterday, the Maritime Affairs Bureau issued an order stating: "Having received the order from the Ministry of Communications on December 25th of this year, 'Hangchuan Zi' No. 4864, it is stated that the case of restricting the age of foreign used ships purchased has been strictly prohibited and investigated by this Ministry's order to the Bureau, and Article 17 of the Supervisory Regulations for the Steamer Industry promulgated on the 9th of this month stipulates the same. Now, various shipping merchants have returned to the Ministry, requesting changes based on the reason that the ordering period was mostly before the promulgation of the Regulations. If the ordering procedures were indeed before the promulgation of the Regulations, they should not be retroactively pursued. However, if there is no time limit, there is a deep fear that abuses may easily occur. It is hereby stipulated that those who ordered foreign used ships before the promulgation of the Supervisory Regulations must submit the ordering documents to the competent Maritime Affairs Bureau for certification before January 31st of the 26th year of the Republic of China, and the Bureau will report to the Ministry for filing, in order to avoid indiscriminate abuse. In addition to distribution, we hereby request your Association to investigate and comply, and to forward this to all steamer companies and bureaus to comply with. (Omitted below)"</p>

The news in the Chinese newspaper that Mr. Kirkpatrick will disembark in Hong Kong for a stay has not been reported here, and it is presumed to be speculation. Mr. Kirkpatrick has also decided to stay briefly in Shanghai and then go to Nanjing to visit your country's authorities before returning to Shanghai to start work. He will then go to various places to inspect at a later date. Mr. O'Leary, an assistant, is coming with Mr. Kirkpatrick.</p>
<h3>Tea Industry Inspection Group to Japan Departed from Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Seven Members in Total, Tea Industry Representatives All Went to See Them Off; It Has Been Decided That the Inspection Trip Will Return to China After Three Weeks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Foreign Tea Industry Association believes that Chinese tea was originally advanced in all countries, but now it is lagging behind. Now, in order to improve manufacturing, increase production, and study trade methods, it has specially sent seven members, Hong Chunzhi, Song Qifan, Li Naichang, Ning Weiting, Tao Zhensheng, Hu Yezhi, and Secretary Yu Gumin, to form an inspection group to Japan.

According to Hong Chunzhi of the group, the group plans to visit Mr. Xu Shiying, our country's ambassador to Japan, after arriving in Tokyo, and then go to Shizuoka, Sangjiao, and other tea-producing areas in Japan for inspection, which will last for three weeks. They will then return to China. This trip is also guided by the Ministry of Industry, which has sent letters to the embassy in Japan to introduce various agencies related to the tea industry to facilitate the inspection. After the group returns to China, it will carefully consider and adopt those that are suitable for our country's conditions based on the actual inspection. It is also learned that after the group returns to China, it plans to go to Java, India, Ceylon, and other places for inspection.</p>

<p>According to sources in the transportation industry, the authorities of the Ministry of Communications have already begun to complete the national postal, telecommunications, and transportation equipment, and are expected to complete it in a short period of time. Because transportation is inconvenient in China's border provinces, postal and telecommunications services cannot be delivered in many places, or they are delivered after many transfers, which takes a long time and has a great impact. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications ordered its subordinate agencies to be responsible for promoting it based on the conditions in various places, and at the same time encouraged postal and telecommunications employees to go to the border to serve. It is learned that this work is progressing very smoothly.</p>

<h3>Silk Merchants and Workers Jointly Requesting a Ban on the Export of Dried Cocoons</h3>
<p>Party and Government Authorities Have Dispatched Personnel for Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>After foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson (British), Volkart Brothers (Swiss), and D'Avigdor (Italian) shipped high-quality cocoons from our country for export, the Silk Manufacturers Association, in addition to writing to the Jianghai Customs to investigate the quantity of cocoons exported and their destination, also petitioned the Municipal Government to take measures to prevent this, in order to avoid affecting the export quantity of Chinese silk and the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of silk reeling workers. At the same time, silk reeling trade unions in various districts also petitioned the Social Bureau and the Municipal Party Headquarters to quickly ban it. It is reported that the party and government authorities attach great importance to this case and have dispatched personnel to secretly investigate it in order to verify and handle it, it is said.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Shortage of Flour</h3>
<p>Insufficient Self-Sufficiency; Still Exporting Outward; Tobacco Industry Affected by Foreign Merchants</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ren Tianshu, Director of the Investigation Department of the China Credit Information Service, speaking to a reporter from the New Sound News Agency, the situation of industry and commerce in our country last year was generally encouraging. In terms of practical goods, the business of cotton cloth, yarn, copper, iron, etc., was very developed. The reasons for this are nothing more than the bumper harvest in rural areas and the currency system reform. Other industries, such as the paper and flour industries, were also beyond expectations. Because our country's flour has always been less than a quarter self-sufficient, relying on imports. However, last year, flour was actually exported, which is one of the biggest reasons for the current domestic flour shortage. In terms of consumables, foreign silk fabrics and the domestic tobacco industry have not developed, and the reason for this is that they have been seized by European and American tobacco companies. This is something that we urgently need to catch up with.</p>
<h3>Change of Counselor at the Italian Embassy</h3>

<h3>Staff of the American Asiatic Silk Factory Remitted a Large Sum Yesterday to Aid Suiyuan</h3>

<h3>Labor Dispute Occurs at Japanese-Owned Asia Iron and Steel Factory</h3>

The Yangshupu Police Station in charge of the area, upon receiving the report, dispatched several Chinese and Japanese detectives to maintain order.

<h3>Those Found Guilty of Drug Trafficking After the End of the Prohibition Period Will Be Executed</h3>
<p>Remarks by Section Chief Dai of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Municipal Police Bureau; Private Smokers Will Also Be Dealt with According to Military Law</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Police Bureau has been handling the prohibition of drugs and opium, it has been actively conducting operations and has achieved great results. Now that the year is renewed and the prohibition of drugs has reached its expiration date, in addition to strictly enforcing the prohibition of drugs in accordance with the law this year, we will continue to urge private smokers to voluntarily surrender and quit, otherwise they will also be dealt with according to military law. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Drug Prohibition Has Reached Its Expiration Date</p>
<p>A Central News Agency reporter visited Dai Xuanzhen, Section Chief of the Anti-Narcotics Section of the Municipal Police Bureau, and according to him, according to the regulations stipulated by the Anti-Opium Commissioner General, the prohibition of drugs is limited to the 25th year of the Republic, and the prohibition of opium is limited to the 29th year of the Republic. Therefore, the prohibition of drugs has reached its expiration date this year. Anyone who manufactures or sells drugs will be executed once discovered, and drug users will at least be sentenced to life imprisonment and will not be leniently treated.</p>
<p>Private Smoking Will Be Dealt with According to Military Law</p>
<p>Dai also reiterated that regarding the prohibition of opium, since the registration of opium smokers and reporting registration were carried out last year, the number of registered opium smokers reached more than 40,000, of which more than 18,000 have registered and voluntarily quit or surrendered to quit. The number of people who renewed their licenses in the last phase of last year was more than 32,000. Although opium smoker registration will no longer be carried out this year, in consideration of the general public of opium smokers, those who can voluntarily surrender and quit will still be allowed to be exempted from punishment or have their sentences suspended in order to show encouragement. However, those who still smoke privately and those who have quit but resume smoking will still be dealt with according to military law. As for the prohibition of opium and drugs, the methods set by the government are slightly different. The prohibition of drugs has reached its expiration date, and the prohibition of opium is scheduled to expire in the 29th year of the Republic. During this period, the government will give private smokers the opportunity to voluntarily surrender and quit, and those who have registered will be limited to quitting year by year.</p>
<p>This Year's Opium Prohibition Plan</p>
<p>This year's planned opium prohibition plan is that all private smokers will be given a deadline to voluntarily surrender and quit. After the deadline expires, they will be dealt with according to military law. Therefore, all private smokers should quickly surrender themselves to the police station so that they can be sent to an opium rehabilitation hospital to quit. After the deadline for voluntary surrender expires, the registered opium smokers will be quit in phases, reducing the total number by one-fifth each year. In this way, it is hoped that all opium smokers will be eliminated after the opium prohibition period expires. Furthermore, as this city is a major industrial and commercial hub with a large floating population, the police station, in consideration of the general public of opium smokers residing here, will formulate measures for opium smokers to travel and relocate, it is said.</p>
<h3>Pawnbrokers' License Fees Reduced by 20%; Chamber of Commerce Petitions for a Two-Year Extension</h3>
<p>The Industry Still Unable to Escape Difficult Circumstances; Requesting Another Extension Is Truly Out of Necessity</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce recently submitted a request to the Social and Finance Bureaus regarding the business license fees for pawnbroking businesses, stating that another two-year extension should be granted and collected at an 80% discount. The petition reads: "Regarding the matter of submitting a petition, it was reported on January 4th by the Pawnbroking Trade Association of this city that the industry must pay business license fees to the Finance Bureau every year. Last year, due to the decline in business, a letter was sent to your chamber to forward to the Social and Finance Bureaus, requesting continued reduction in collection. The bureaus, in consideration of the difficulties of businesses, approved a reduction of 20% and granted an extension of one year. Time flies, and the collection period is approaching again. Although the industry has struggled extremely hard in the past year, making great efforts to support itself and barely surviving, the market is sluggish and business is desolate, remaining the same as before. The expenses of each pawnshop are large, and income is insufficient to cover them, resulting in a strong exterior but a weak interior and increasing deficits. We are still unable to escape the difficult circumstances. Therefore, regarding the business license fees to be paid by our industry this year, we have no choice but to earnestly request your chamber to consider the difficulties of businesses, quickly forward to the Social and Finance Bureaus, continue to collect at an 80% discount, and grant another two-year extension to show consideration and maintain business. We are waiting for your instructions with the utmost urgency." The letter has been received by the chamber. The reduction of 20% in business license fees for pawnbroking businesses was approved in the 23rd year of the Republic for a two-year extension. Later, because business still did not improve, in March of the 25th year, a petition was submitted to the Municipal Government, which approved another one-year extension. The Finance and your Bureau copied the chamber's petition and notified us. It was stated in the joint petition from your Bureau and the Finance Bureau to the Municipal Government on February 6th of last year that a two-year extension was requested. Later, the Municipal Government's Order No. 1757 approved another one-year extension. Considering the circumstances, it was appropriate to observe business conditions and leave room for further consideration at that time. Now, according to the industry's statement, the deficits last year were greater and they were still unable to escape the difficult circumstances. This time, the industry's request for another extension is truly out of necessity. We are submitting this document for your review and approval, requesting that you forward it to the Finance Bureau for joint handling. This is for the public benefit. A letter has been sent to the Finance Bureau, and the letter to the Shanghai Social Bureau is the same as before."</p>

<h3>Fruit Vendor Convicted of Obstructing Official Business</h3>
<p>Chinese Constable Wang Shirong, No. 290, from the Old Zha Police Station, was ordered on the morning of the 29th of last month to drive away fruit vendors in the Shanxi Road area. Because the fruit vendors gathered to resist, the constable drew his gun in self-defense. He accidentally triggered the gun, injuring the legs of fruit vendor Huang Fugen and passers-by Li Xisheng and You Xiaochuanzi. Afterwards, the police station detained Huang and the fruit vendors Chen Fanglin and Shi Heqing who were at the scene at the time, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention.

<h3>Failed Abduction; Pushed Person into the Creek</h3>
<p>Zhang Chungen Was Insidious and Cruel</p>
<p>Sun Zhu, a woman from Yixing, 20 years old, worked in a yarn factory in Caojiadu, Shanghai West. She married a man named Sun and lived together in Shanghai. Zhang Chungen was a friend of her husband and lived in the Sun's house. Because Zhang was skilled in flattery and could falsely show care to women, he had an affair with Sun Zhu. The day before yesterday, Zhang Chungen intended to induce Sun Zhu to take a boat to export her for a good price. When they reached the creek, she saw through his plan and refused to go on board. They quarreled, and Zhang became fierce and cruel, pushing her violently into the creek, almost drowning her. Fortunately, the water patrol police rescued her. After questioning her about the situation, they arrested Zhang and transferred him to the District Court yesterday. Prosecutor Chang Fengkong interrogated him and ordered him to be detained for attempted murder and adultery, pending further questioning of her husband.</p>
<h3>Drug Pills Found in Zhou Chuntao's Home</h3>
<p>Zhou Was Not Home; His Mother Was Detained</p>
<p>The Yimiao Police Station received a confidential letter yesterday accusing Zhou Chuntao of No. 111 Xueyuan Road of secretly selling red pills and setting up lamp guns for people to consume drug pills. Director Yu discovered that Zhou Chuntao had escaped in the 23rd year of the Republic after a drug trafficking case. He was a wanted criminal who had not yet been apprehended. Now, he dared to not repent even under the strict prohibition order and still secretly sold and consumed drug pills. This was extremely illegal. He immediately dispatched household registration inspector Chen Shusheng to lead the police to investigate. Zhou Chuntao was not at home, only his mother, Zhou Gu, was at home. A search was then started and 19 red pills, a red pill lamp gun, a bag of red pill ash, and miscellaneous items were found. Zhou Gu claimed that her daughter-in-law consumed them and had now fled. Zhou Gu was taken to the station, and Zhou's guarantor, Cheng Yulin, who lived at No. 114 Xueyuan Road, was asked to provide bail. In addition to ordering bail to be posted, the case was related to the strict prohibition of drugs and was transferred to the bureau for legal handling.</p>
<h3>Arson Committed After Failed Extortion</h3>
<p>Liu Ding, a woman from Taixing, lived in a thatched shed in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West. Her husband, Liu Qiyin, died in August last year. Because the woman had no means of support, she began living with Liu Jintai. Her paternal uncles, Ding Yuankun and Ding Sanyuan, and husband's clan member Liu Bangchen, used this as an excuse to extort money from her. On the night of the 21st of last month, while Liu Jintai and the woman were fast asleep, they went to knock on the door to catch them in adultery. Liu Ding and Liu Jintai, fearing harm, refused to open the door. The Dings threatened to set the house on fire, but the door remained unopened. The Dings were furious and set fire to Liu Ding's thatched shed at about 1:00 AM that night. Liu Jintai and the woman had to rush out of the door, but the Dings arrested them and falsely accused them of arson. After the police transferred them, the District Court was notified, and Prosecutor Li Fen learned the truth. Because the actions of the three Dings were extremely malicious, they were prosecuted for arson and false accusation and asked to be severely punished. Yesterday, Judge Wu opened the court, and the defendants hired lawyer Liu Xiang to defend them, denying everything. The court ordered an investigation and another hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Three Convicted of Counterfeiting Subsidiary Coins are Punished</h3>
<p>The He Xing Printing Factory, located at No. 10, Lane 778, Peng Road, recently forged a reverse copper plate of the two-dime subsidiary coin of the Farmers Bank of China. Just as they were about to continue making plates and printing counterfeit coins, Shao Jingfan, a Chinese detective chief of the Jiaxing Road police station, along with detective Yang Xinzheng and officer Chen Jinsheng, discovered the plot. On the 28th of last month at 8:40 PM, they secretly went to arrest the suspects. Near North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road, they first apprehended Zhang Jingkang, a runner from Anhui Province working at the factory, and found a reverse model of the two-dime subsidiary coin of the Farmers Bank of China on his person. They then proceeded to the printing factory and arrested Zhu Fengtang from Haimen, Xu Fugao from Danyang, and suspects Yang Ganxiang, Yang Shaokang, Shen Jusheng, Qiang Baishun, and Chen Xiangwen, along with one thousand others. They were escorted to the First Special District Court. They confessed that the principal offender was Zhang Jinrong, the factory's old reader, who was at large. The court ordered a detailed investigation to be conducted later. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhong Qing presided over a further hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated that during the extended investigation, it was found that Yang Shaokang, Shen Jusheng, Qiang Baishun, and Chen Xiangwen were not involved and requested their release. The court approved this. After questioning the remaining four, Judge Zhong clearly sentenced Zhang Jingkang to three years in prison, Zhu Fengtang and Xu Fugao to two years and six months each. Yang Ganxiang was acquitted and released. The forged copper plate of the two-dime coin of the Farmers Bank of China was confiscated.</p>

<h3>A Pitiful Maidservant</h3>
<p>Abused by Her Mistress and Violated by Her Master; She Escapes and Gets Lost, Crying Loudly to the Police on Duty</p>
<p>A girl named Wang Xiaoguniang (real name Shi Hua) from Yunnan, orphaned at the age of three, was trafficked to a Zhou surnamed cotton broker in the British Concession, Zhejiang Road, to be a maidservant. She is now twelve years old. She usually suffers abuse from her mistress, often swallowing her tears silently. In April of this year, after being forcibly violated by the Zhou surname, she suffered even harsher treatment from her mistress, and was frequently beaten. Unable to endure it any longer, she seized an opportunity to escape the night before last. However, being unfamiliar with the roads, she went all the way to Xiaobeimen, where she was questioned by a police officer on duty. She then cried loudly, telling her endless suffering. The officer immediately took her to the station. After questioning, her statements matched the above. However, she did not know her master's name or gambling card, only calling her master "Old Master." She was usually not allowed to go out, but said she could identify the place if taken there. Director Shen believed that it was necessary to verify whether the lost girl had been raped and ordered her to be sent to the bureau for relief.</p>
<h3>Policeman on Duty Robbed of Gun</h3>
<p>Thief Hugs Policeman's Waist and Stabs Violently with a Sharp Knife; Policeman Unable to Resist, Gun Stolen</p>
<p>Xu Zhong'er, officer No. 262 of the Yongxing Road Police Station in Zhabei, from Jiangsu Province, age 23, was assigned to guard duty at the intersection of Baoshan Road and Lan'an Lane at around 10:10 PM last night. Suddenly, three men dressed in short jackets rushed forward, attempting to rob Officer Xu of his eight-inch handgun. Officer Xu resisted bravely, hugging one of the thieves around the waist. The other two thieves snatched the gun, and one stabbed Officer Xu in the head and face with a sharp knife, causing two cuts on his left cheek, bleeding profusely. His right pinky finger was also stabbed. The thief being held struggled free and fled with the other two thieves, disappearing in an instant. Officer Xu, injured, returned to the station to report. A large number of officers were dispatched to pursue the robbers, but it was too late, and the thieves had already fled far away. The station reported the incident to the General Bureau, requesting that all branches and police stations be notified to strictly investigate and apprehend the three gun-robbing thieves, to be severely investigated. The injured officer Xu has been taken to the hospital for treatment by car, and his condition is not serious.</p>
<h3>Japanese National Goes to Zhenhua Factory to Discuss Debt Dispute</h3>
<p>Claims to Have Been Beaten by Factory Staff; Accuses Factory Owner of Assault</p>
<p>The Zhenhua Weaving Factory in Yangshupu is now managed by You Jusun from Wuxi. On the afternoon of December 26th of last year, Mr. Goto, a Japanese national who was a former creditor of the factory, along with Jukutaro Shiroi and an interpreter, went to the factory, claiming to want to meet with the current manager to discuss debt matters. You was not at the factory at the time. The Japanese national then had a conflict with other staff members. After the local police station was alerted, they immediately dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to mediate. Afterwards, Jukutaro Shiroi, claiming to have been beaten and injured, argued that You Jusun, as the factory owner, should be held responsible. He then hired a lawyer and filed a criminal lawsuit against You in the First Special District Court for assault. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Tao opened the court to summon and examine the case. You arrived with his defense lawyer Jiang Yiping, while the plaintiff did not appear due to illness and remained hospitalized. His representative lawyer stated the prosecution's intent. The witness, Mr. Goto, testified that the factory shares he held were mortgaged by Xue Chunshan. The purpose of their visit to the factory that day was to inquire about the status of those shares. The defendant was not at the factory at the time. Someone then called the defendant, who subsequently had Shiroi beaten, so the defendant should be held responsible, and so on. During the questioning, You stated that he was watching a ball game at the stadium during the conflict, but there were only two or three staff members in the factory, and there was no beating of the plaintiff. The court stated that the case still needed investigation and ordered that the hearing be adjourned to another date.</p>
<h3>Pawnbroking Industry Stable Last Year</h3>
<p>Commodity Prices Increase But No Closures; New De Kang Pawnshop Opens on Shandong Road</p>
<p>The pawnbroking industry in this city generally saw a turnaround last year due to rising commodity prices. New pawnshops have also been established. A reporter from the Datong News Agency has learned the following:</p>
<p>Pawnbroking Industry Situation Stable Last Year: Due to the high commodity prices last year, and also due to various reasons such as shortening the maturity of pledged goods, pawnbroking businesses, after being in extreme difficulty, suddenly saw signs of recovery. It is found that there are a total of 45 pawnshops in the Chinese areas of this city and 31 in the Special District. The situation last year was very stable, and there were no closures.</p>
<p>New Pawnshop Opens for the First Time in Ten Years</p>
<p>Although the industry has implemented shorter maturity periods for pledged goods since New Year's Day last year, due to improved conditions, many pawnshops, in order to attract customers, have extended the maturity period to 18 months, so there is no uniformity, especially in the Special District. At the same time, a new De Kang pawnshop opened at No. 111 Shandong Road on January 3rd of this year. In the past ten years, pawnshops have only closed down and not opened, so this is clear proof of the industry's turnaround, it is said.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Office of the Opium Exchange Industry Discusses Exchange Rate Issues</h3>
<p>Believes that Others are Manipulating the Market; Requests Executive Committee to Discuss Thorough Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Office of the Opium Exchange Industry Association held a meeting of representatives from the South Shanghai area due to the recent low exchange rates, which have caused much public complaint. Furthermore, with income tax about to be implemented, and a proposal to reorganize retail prices, they took advantage of the New Year's group gathering to convene a meeting of representatives from the South Shanghai area. More than forty people including Qian Wenda, Chen Kunxian, Mi Chuxin, Chen Enqi, Chai Yasheng, Zhang Bingyuan, Qian Xuanqing, Chen Zhenshe, and Yang Keqin attended. Mi Chuxin was elected as chairman, Zhang Songji as secretary, and the meeting was conducted in due form. First, the chairman reported on the exchange rate issue, saying that the recent low exchange rates have attracted public attention. Those who do not understand the truth accuse our industry of manipulating market prices, monopolizing profits, and even call us unscrupulous merchants. This is a serious slander. The exchange rates in our industry are based on the market list. For wholesale exchanges, we exchange with money shops at market prices and only take a small handling fee. As for who is manipulating the exchange rates, it can be found out by investigating the person who publishes the market list. Unfortunately, the public does not investigate thoroughly. Secondly, he said that income tax will be implemented soon, and our industry should pay attention to improving the accounting books for assessment. The retail prices should also be thoroughly reorganized. He asked for everyone's discussion. The resolutions are as follows: ① The industry does not control the exchange rate, but our industry should take the responsibility of stabilizing the exchange rate. We should request the convening of an executive committee meeting to discuss thorough measures. ② The income tax issue should be studied by Mr. Zhang Songji, and then notified to each business. ③ The retail price issue should be evaluated by Wang Changfa, Chen Kunxian, and Qian Xuanqing, and a list should be published and distributed to inform the industry to comply. The rest are omitted.</p>

<h3>Lawsuit to Recover Antique Porcelain</h3>
<p>Deceased Man's Son is Destitute; Nie Junwei Denies Storage</p>
<p>Nie Junwei, brother of Nie Yuntai, former chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, made a sworn friendship with He Songwen from Yangzhou in his hometown of Hunan during the late Qing Dynasty. During the Wuchang Uprising in 1911, the Nie family moved to Shanghai. In the same year, He stored four pieces of antique porcelain with Junwei in Shanghai for over twenty years. He has since passed away, and his family has also declined. He's son, He Shinian, is confined to his home and has become destitute and disabled in recent years. It was not until two years ago that he found a receipt written by Nie Junwei in his suitcase, acknowledging receipt of the four antique porcelain pieces. He then invited Zhu Nianbai and Dai Gongmou to Shanghai to ask Junwei for the original items at the Nie residence at No. 9, Duofu Lane, Foch Road. Because they could not get them, He Shinian hired lawyer Yuan Yang'an to file a criminal self-accusation of embezzlement against Nie Junwei in the First Special District Court, and filed a civil lawsuit requesting a judgment ordering the return of the original items, or compensation of 8,500 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened the court to hear the case. According to the plaintiff, my father passed away in 1915. It was not until my mother died two years ago that I found this receipt and learned about the storage of antique porcelain. Initially, my family was still in good condition, so I did not pursue it. Now, because I am increasingly poor and sick, I am asking the defendant to return it. He also presented the receipt and a letter from the defendant to He's father, as well as a red paper with gold dragons for sworn brotherhood, to prove that the receipt was indeed written by the defendant. The court questioned Nie Junwei, who admitted that he had become sworn brothers with He Songwen, but denied that he had stored antique porcelain. He said that the receipt might have been imitated, and if there was a fact of storing antique porcelain, why did the plaintiff not ask for it before? Then, witness Zhu Nianbai was called to court, and testified that in Yangzhou in October 1933, he heard He Shinian mention that his father had stored antique porcelain during his lifetime, so he entrusted He to visit the defendant with Dai Gongmou in Shanghai. At that time, the defendant said that the antique porcelain might be in Hunan and was willing to give the plaintiff two or three hundred yuan to settle it, but the money was not paid. I visited again the following year, but did not meet him. Finally, the lawyers of both parties debated each other, and the official will pronounce the judgment next Friday afternoon.</p>

<h3>A Mother-in-Law and Daughter-in-Law Disagree, Leading to a Lawsuit Between the Two Families</h3>
<p>Daughter-in-Law Finds It Hard to Endure the Mental Anguish, Judge Kindly Advises Reconciliation</p>
<p>Lu Chen (57 years old), an elderly woman from Suzhou residing at 321 Avenue Dubail, French Concession, has a son named Lu Desun, 22 years old. Two years ago, on October 10th, through a matchmaker, he married Zhou Weizhen (19 years old this year), the daughter of Zhou Yu (47 years old), who was from the same hometown. Within two months of the marriage, conflicts arose between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Consequently, Lu Zhou Weizhen often found excuses to return to Ningbo, not wanting to live with her mother-in-law. On June 26th of the previous year (1936), Weizhen was at her mother-in-law's house when she was criticized by her mother-in-law for cooking the rice porridge too thick for dinner. Weizhen then added water to dilute the porridge, but her mother-in-law criticized her again for adding too much water, causing the porridge to become thin and tasteless. Weizhen, constantly subjected to her mother-in-law's harsh treatment, felt unable to vent her anger and secretly swallowed perfume in an attempt to commit suicide. She was unsuccessful and was sent back to her mother's house by her mother-in-law and husband, where she stayed for several months. Last winter, Weizhen, unable to bear living alone, filed a petition with the Second Special District Court's Civil Division, requesting mediation to rent a separate house and live apart from her mother-in-law. Upon learning of this, Lu Chen went to the house of her in-laws, the Zhou Yu family, on December 28th of the previous year, intending to bring her daughter-in-law Weizhen home. This resulted in a conflict, with the two mothers-in-law getting into a fight, leading to injuries. On New Year's Eve, the court held a mediation session, but it failed because the opposing party did not appear. Lu Chen has now hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court's Criminal Division, accusing Zhou Yu and others of assault and requesting an investigation. The court accepted the lawsuit, and yesterday morning, Judge Qiu Huan-ying presided over the Second Criminal Division and summoned both parties for questioning. After questioning both sides in court, the judge earnestly advised them, "You are in-laws and should not become enemies. You should each put aside your grievances and reconcile, since you have met in court out of spite." He also reprimanded Zhou Weizhen, instructing her to obey her mother-in-law's teachings and not to leave her husband's home to live separately. The judge then ordered the two lawyers to conduct an outside conciliation. If conciliation fails, the case will be heard again on the 13th.</p>

<h3>Rickshaw Puller Dies Tragically, Police File Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>Zhou Wang, a woman from Jiangbei residing at 401 Avenue Foch, French Concession, had a four-year-old daughter named Aimao. On the morning of December 26th of the previous year, at 9:00 AM, while squatting in front of the house to urinate, a ten-year-old boy named Xiangbao, the son of Lu Jinkui, a local resident living at 409, passed by and playfully interacted with Aimao. The girl cried and told her mother, who rushed to the Lu family to question and argue. At that time, Xia Chengshan, a rickshaw puller living at 403, came to mediate. Chen Zhixiang, a Jiangyin native living with Lu, reached out to stop Xia. Xia, losing his balance, fell backward, hitting his head on the threshold. Due to the concussion, he fainted. Cao Jiasan, who was present, helped Xia up, and Yuan Si, a fellow rickshaw puller and fellow villager of Xia, took him to the hospital. He died before receiving treatment. The police reported the death to the Second Special District Court, and the prosecutor examined the body. Because the deceased was from Dongtai, his nephew claimed the body. Meanwhile, the police detained Lu Jinkui and Chen Zhixiang and sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special District Court presided over the First Criminal Division and questioned them. Chen Ming, a lawyer from the police department, explained the investigation process and prosecuted Lu and Chen for causing death through negligent injury. The deceased's family has not yet arrived in Shanghai. When questioned, the defendants denied committing assault and injury. The court adjourned the hearing and scheduled another date.</p>
<h3>Recent News of Qiu Cao's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Chen Qiu Cao lyrical painting exhibition, which is currently being held, has attracted a large audience since its opening on New Year's Day, causing a sensation. The venue is the Jin Ting Hall on the fourth floor of the Great World Department Store on Nanjing Road. The lighting is used to enhance the display, and a flower arrangement is placed in the center, along with various marble stationery items recently designed and made by Mr. Chen. The wall trees are high, decorated with silver-gray crepe paper, creating an extremely elegant effect. A total of more than a hundred works are exhibited, with ink paintings accounting for half of them. Many are works expressing emotion, such as "Superman's Courage to Resist Oppression," with powerful brushstrokes and profound ideas. The twenty-odd decorative and lyrical paintings are clear and elegant in their artistic conception, full of poetic charm, and particularly noteworthy. The paintings of nude ladies, moonlight, and floral shadows use the four scenes of fullness, fullness, incompleteness, and incompleteness to depict seasonal moods. Other works, such as "Seemingly Bright and Radiant, Full of Innocence Buried" and "Still Tonight is a Paradise, Don't Count on Tomorrow's Scorched Earth," have cautionary titles that are thought-provoking. The decorative structures are unique. Many people have been placing orders in recent days. It is said that Mr. Chen is willing to donate half of the proceeds from the sale of tickets to the Suiyuan army, setting a precedent for the art world to support Suiyuan.

<p>He Plans to Stay in China for Two Years to Write a Book on the Far East Situation</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Mr. Not Fei, an American author and journalist, recently arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday after staying in Japan for three months. He plans to stay in China for two years to continue writing a book on the Far East situation. He will also write articles on the political, social, and economic conditions of the East for Harper's Magazine, Asia Magazine, and the New York Times. According to Mr. Fei, his future writings will focus on Japan's new development on the Asian continent and the impact of this development on the politics and economy of China and Japan. Mr. Fei also said that since he left China in 1929, the issue of China adapting to Western trends has become much more complicated. In the past, the main issue was a domestic one, namely China's internal construction to rise from medievalism to a new era. Now it has become a foreign issue. Today's internal problems will depend on the relationship between China and Japan. He believes that China's social weaknesses today have not increased compared to the past century, but because they depend on foreign affairs, they have become more complicated. The so-called foreign affairs are how Japan will treat its neighbor across the sea in the future. In the decade from 1919 to 1929, the urgency of internal problems was due to the fact that China was making a final break with the past and moving towards modernization. Mr. Fei further stated that his views should be regarded as the attitude of an observer thousands of miles away, because he has not yet had the opportunity to make a detailed observation to confirm this view. When President Chiang Kai-shek was in trouble in Xi'an, Mr. Fei was in Japan. Mr. Fei said that when Tokyo received the news that Chiang Kai-shek was out of danger, it was very excited. Many newspapers published extra editions to express their joy. According to reports, Mr. Fei is good at commenting on Far East issues and has a high reputation in Asia and the Americas. He first came to China in 1915 and worked for the Continental Daily News, later serving as a correspondent for the New York Tribune in Peiping. He returned to the United States in 1919. Since arriving in China, Mr. Fei has often written articles for Harper's Magazine, Asia Magazine, and the New Republic, and has written several books on China's political, economic, and social issues, as well as the relationship between China and the great powers. Mr. Fei now plans to stay in Shanghai and the capital for a few months, then go to Peiping, and then enter the Northeast. During his two years in China, he plans to travel extensively in the interior of China to broaden his knowledge.</p>

<h3>Gansu Refugee Relief Group Appeals for Donations</h3>
<p>More Than Three Million People Are Crying Out for Food, City Government Transfers to Charity Group for Disaster Relief</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government sent a letter to the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association yesterday, stating: "Pursuant to the Mayor's instruction, a letter from the Gansu Anti-Bandit Counties Refugee Relief Group was received, requesting sympathy for the border people and generous donations. The instructions have been transferred to the Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association for handling. Accordingly, a copy of the original letter is attached for your reference." The original letter from the Gansu Anti-Bandit Counties Refugee Relief Group is transcribed below: "Respected Sirs, Gansu is a poor and densely populated area. In the past decade, it has suffered from frequent famines and disasters. The rural economy has collapsed, and all industries are depressed. Just when we were hoping for a gradual recovery, we have suffered another devastating blow. The red bandits from Sichuan, Kang, and Shaanxi have broken through the encirclement and poured into Gansu, capturing Lintan, Zhang County, Weitou, Hui County, Cheng County, Liangdang, Kang County, Tongwei, Huining, Longde, Heshui, Huan County, Jingtai, Gulang, and besieging Min County, Lintao, Longxi, Li County, Xihe, Haiyuan, Zhenyuan, Jingyuan, Wuwei, Yongchang, and harassing Kangle, Taosha, Yuzhong, Dingxi, Tianshui, Xigu, Wushan, Gangu, Qingshui, Qin'an, Ningjing, Zhuanglang, Guyuan, Jingchuan, Pingliang, Chongxin, Zhengning, Ning County, Qingyang, Huaping, Yongdeng, Gaolan, Minqin, and Shandan. The total area affected by the bandits reaches more than fifty counties. The bandits have occupied each county for more than a year, or half a year, or at least a month. The bandits are fierce and cruel. They plunder property, grain, horses, and livestock wherever they go, digging up cellars, slaughtering livestock, torturing men and women, and demanding everything. They search and take away everything they can transport and need, regardless of size, and burn or destroy what they do not need, leaving nothing behind. The estimated losses are more than ten million yuan. The disaster is severe and unprecedented. More than three million lives have been poisoned and plunged into despair. Now, at the end of the year, with the cold weather, hunger and cold are intertwined, and the dead are lying everywhere, crying out for food. The strong men of each county, motivated by righteous indignation, have sacrificed their lives for the country, leaving behind orphans and widows who have no one to support them. They are wandering and destitute, and their situation is particularly tragic. The provincial government and the relief committee have been trying their best to provide relief, but it is like a drop in the bucket, and it is difficult to fill even one ten-thousandth of the need. We have always admired your government's compassion and concern for the people. We beg you to have sympathy for the border people and generously donate. We also pray that you will forward our request to the central government to follow the examples of Jiangxi, Sichuan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi and quickly allocate three million yuan for emergency relief, which will be handed over to the provincial relief committee to be distributed to the counties according to the affected population to save lives. We are deeply grateful." Addressed to Mayor Wu of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, We are writing to you regarding the report in today's issue of your newspaper in the "Local News" column about the court hearing of the lawsuit filed by our client, Chen Xingzhen, against Yuanda Securities for tax evasion. We were shocked to see the words "Yongtaihe tax evasion case" mentioned in the report. After investigation, we have found that Yongtaihe Tobacco Co., Ltd. has no tax evasion case, and our lawyer would never make unwarranted accusations. It is clear that there is an error in the wording. We are afraid that this will cause misunderstanding to the outside world, so we hereby request that you make a correction to avoid trouble. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Da Yaoxian, lawyer, January 6th, 1937, at the newspaper office.</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Ah Er Next Door Doesn't Steal Chickens</h3>
<p>— Me</p>
<p>When reading the famous sayings of important people and great men in the newspaper, or the writings published by foreign important people and great men, one should never look at them from the front, but should infer and speculate from the side, the periphery, and the back in various ways in order to find some meaning and understand the truth. Otherwise, one will inevitably be fooled. Is this kind of talk meant to deliberately deceive people? No, absolutely not. I can forgive them for it being a kind of political manipulation.</p>
<p>Although this kind of political manipulation is visible to everyone and guessed by everyone, they cannot but publish a kind of invaluable wonderful theory, which must have its own reasons and effects. If one says that this kind of writing is completely worthless, then naturally this kind of writing has considerable value. Otherwise, it would not be worth going to such lengths to create meaningless moaning. Believe it or not, I will say it anyway, so I say this is the same as a statement like ‘Ah Er next door doesn't steal chickens.’</p>
<p>For example, a certain country, when it comes to our country, speaks of ‘Sino-× friendliness’ and ‘coexistence and co-prosperity.’ These nice-sounding terms are spoken of with a resounding voice. May I ask, do they really want coexistence and co-prosperity? Is there Sino-× friendliness? Let's look at their friendly attitude and how they intend to coexist, and we can know that they are using the same tricks as a monkey trainer, which are completely unreliable.</p>
<p>A Tokyo dispatch on the 5th states that Japan's Arita Hachiro, regarding the Japanese-German Anti-Comintern Pact, caused various misunderstandings, and specifically on the afternoon of the 5th, gave a broadcast speech on the international significance of the Anti-Comintern Pact, stating that it was for "special viewing and has no other purpose." He asked the United States and Britain to be bold and rest assured, and not to be too suspicious. But may I ask whether people from the United States and Britain can believe and not doubt this kind of statement? I think the people of the United States and Britain are not like this at all. But whether or not they believe it is up to them, whether or not I say it is up to me.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when listening to their words, one must also silently observe the current situation. The Japanese-German Anti-Comintern Pact has been signed for some time, and at that time they even took this pact to have an all-encompassing air. Why are they now suddenly wrapping up a broadcast speech to explain the meaning? Naturally, there is a reason for it, and there must be a considerable effect.</p>
<p>So from where can one see this reason? The reader observes the international situation, our country's situation, and their own country's situation, and then this statement will have its own reason. I don't need to go into detail.</p>
<h3>In Manchuria</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>A Story Brought from Manchuria</p>
<p>My friend took another sip of tea, paused for a moment, and then said:</p>
<p>“You probably don't know the Wanquan River if you haven't been to Shenyang! It's truly a good place. In the summer, the willow branches brush against the clear water, and the scenery is excellent. There are many people playing. The circus from Japan also set up tents there, and there are also temporary performance troupes set up by our Shandong people, doing damage, fighting, everything. There are also girls from Peiping singing Luozixi opera, local wild stage operas, the sound of the trumpets, drums, and people can be heard half a mile away. The entire Wanquan River is as lively as a newly opened hot pot.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I came to Shenyang from Changchun they called it 'Xinjing,' but we always called it the old name Changchun to visit some fellow villagers, wanting to find a job. This was just talk, actually finding one was not easy. I just casually stayed at a friend's house. He was a teacher at some middle school, a very cheerful and generous person. As soon as I arrived, he said, 'Old Huang, it's not easy to find a job these days, just stay here for now.' That's how I stayed until that summer.</p>
<p>But Shenyang is really not as good as it used to be. There are many earth-shattering things happening. One day, several students from a girls' middle school in the city were strolling along the Wanquan River, and several people with Hitler mustaches saw them. These people were used to being powerful and unrestrained. They followed them, followed them, and followed them until halfway, one of them couldn't contain himself and actually stepped forward and pinched one of them on the face. So, the girls ran, crying and shouting: 'Help! Help!' Luckily, they met several 'red sleeves' halfway. Red sleeves are the soldiers of the so-called 'Manchukuo.' When they saw them, they shouted:</p>
<p>'You are Chinese, save us!'</p>
<p>At that time, those with Hitler mustaches were secretly delighted and ignored their dignified appearance, following from behind.</p>
<p>Those red sleeves also had backbone. Seeing this, they rushed forward and stopped those chasing people. Those with Hitler mustaches were not willing to give up, and everyone started fighting. That's how things got out of hand.</p>
<p>A few days later, there was trouble at Wanquan River."</p>
<h3>Winter Night</h3>
<p>— Wei Qingge</p>
<p>It was already midnight, and he was still tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep. He heard the north wind outside, howling, and he felt a little troubled! But he saw Lan Jun, sleeping beside him, sleeping so comfortably, and he felt envious.</p>
<p>'We sleep in the same place, why can you sleep soundly while I can't?' He asked Lan Jun when he woke up in the morning.</p>
<p>'Because every night before I go to bed, I always wash my feet with hot water, which draws the blood downwards and helps me sleep soundly. However, I also put ‘Arinsa’ medicinal water in the water, which can stop itching and remove dampness, preventing athlete's foot. And...' Lan Jun said, her voice lowered, and she whispered in his ear: 'And I also use ‘Arinsa’ to disinfect my body every night when I wash it, to prevent bacterial infections, which can lead to leucorrhea and uterine diseases.' (Arinsa, produced by Wuzhou.)</p>
<h3>World of Sickness</h3>
<p>— Jiang Ci</p>
<p>Nowadays, almost everyone suffers from illness. Some people suffer from several diseases at the same time, and some people suffer from at least one disease. Therefore, the world today can truly be said to be a world of sickness.</p>
<p>These sick people suffer from the pain of disease, and who among them does not hope to recover soon? It's just that they cannot get appropriate treatment, or they take ineffective medicines, and so their illness is prolonged.</p>
<p>Then, is there really no medicine to relieve pain? No, effective medicines must be bought from reputable pharmacies. For example, the various prepared medicines produced by Wuzhou Pharmacy are very effective and trusted by society because Wuzhou's preparations are meticulous. Furthermore, Wuzhou has also established various diagnostic departments in its main store building. The chief physicians are all the most famous doctors in Shanghai, which is another convenience for patients.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Dozens of Red Sleeves beat twelve ‘Jintan’ men to death. This matter has become the talk of the town. You must know, who is paying the Red Sleeves? Their platoon leader and instructors all have ‘Jintan’ mustaches. It’s really not easy to do such a thing. Do you think these people are foolish? Can you say they have forgotten that they are Chinese?</p>
<p>But, there are even more shocking things. On the day of the incident, all the streets and alleys were under martial law, and planes kept roaring in the sky. Our fellow villager, Mr. Zhang, came back in a car. This person is riding in a car, probably for the first time, I think. He rushed into the room in a panic, and the first sentence he said to me was:</p>
<p>'Old Huang, do you have any friends in Shenyang?'</p>
<p>This is really baffling, making people unable to understand. I looked at him, knowing that something must be wrong, and said:</p>
<p>'I do have some friends, but not close ones. What's the matter?'</p>
<p>'I think you should stay at a friend's house tonight. Other friends are coming to my place, a lot of people, I'm really sorry, really... But, maybe I'll have to move...'</p>
<p>He started packing things, really in a panic. I stood there, unable to think of a solution. Suddenly, someone came up, the raincoat (it was raining heavily outside) rustling against the wall. The person who came ran to our door, knocking hard on the door while saying:</p>
<p>'Is Mr. Zhang at home?'</p>
<p>Without waiting for a reply, he pushed the door open. Guess who it was? It was a policeman!</p>
<p>Our Mr. Zhang held the table with both hands, his face pale, without saying a word.</p>
<p>'Are you Mr. Zhang? I hope you leave this place before 11 o'clock tonight. This is my good intentioned advice, it will be too late if you delay.' The policeman looked around and wanted to leave without turning his head.</p>
<p>'Hey, friend, are you saying someone wants to:…'</p>
<p>Yes, they have already planned it. I hope you hurry. I am Chinese, I have a conscience, so I risked coming here to tell you. Goodbye.'</p>
<p>He left, and Mr. Zhang's tears fell down in strings uncontrollably. I seemed to be lost in a fog, feeling that everything was too mysterious.</p>
<p>I looked out the window, and the messenger was walking out in the rain.</p>
<p>The next day, we read in the newspaper that those ‘Jintan’ men were going to arrest our Mr. Zhang, saying that Mr. Zhang was colluding with the Red Sleeves, specializing in doing rebellious things. They said ‘the main criminal is on the run.’</p>
<p>That person's image is still deeply engraved in my mind. You think, aren't there still many people in the world with blood, integrity, and conscience? You see them wearing that uniform that makes you want to vomit as soon as you see it, thinking that they have even sold their souls, no, no, you will understand after hearing my story.</p>
<p>'Our Mr. Zhang left Shenyang after that incident. I haven't been in contact. Friends from Harbin said a few times ago that he had died. What a pity! If China has more people like this, there will always be a day to turn things around!'</p>
<p>My friend sighed, looking at us with fiery eyes.</p>
<h3>Sick</h3>
<p>— Li Wen</p>
<p>It has been several days since I saw the sun. Hearing the crows chirping on the white cypress trees in the back garden, I know that another day has come to an end. Sick people are more sentimental, and there is no way to relieve it. Usually, I don't regard ‘time flies like an arrow’ as a golden rule, and I always delay doing a trivial task for a few days before taking action. But once I get sick, I feel that the days on the sickbed pass too quickly. Hearing the sound of crows, I count the days I have been sick again. In fact, it’s not that I suddenly cherish time, it’s just that I’m too lonely lying on the sickbed. It's not a serious illness, and my mind is very clear, so I now think about how to clear up the work that I have accumulated, and I have also planned what I want to do after I recover, so naturally I feel that the days are passing too quickly.</p>
<p>When sick, I also like to have strange ideas, and my hearing is particularly sensitive. Whatever my family members are talking about in the next room, as long as I hear a piece of it, I will infer from it, hoping to discover a secret. Although they clearly tell me that they are talking about a certain thing or a certain person, and that this thing or this person has nothing to do with me. But I still think that a part of things must be kept secret from me, and I try to infer from the closest places. As a result, I make a fairy tale-like conclusion by myself. At that time, I laugh dumbly, knowing that I am too nervous.</p>
<p>The most thoughts when sick are about death. On the first day I couldn't get out of bed, I thought about whether I would die immediately from this illness. Usually, I am a person who is not afraid of death, and I take everything very lightly. And I often laugh at people who commit suicide, thinking that if they want to die, let them die, why bother to end their lives with their own hands? But these days, I am often entangled in death, like a rope that cannot be untied.</p>
<p>Because of death, of course, I will also think of ghosts. One night when the fever was the highest, I didn't dare to close my eyes. As soon as I closed my eyes, it seemed that many ghostly figures were wandering in front of my bed. My mother and children were sitting in front of my bed, perhaps worried by my delirium! But I was very clear. I seemed to want them to go to sleep. They had been too tired for my illness. I don't know if these words in my heart were spoken, because I was afraid of breaking the atmosphere of loneliness. At night, I am very afraid of sounds, and the most afraid of is two people whispering. When they talk in a low voice, I will think that they are talking about my illness or that it has reached an incurable point. And when the wind blows the paper window, or the rats walk in the corner of the wall, when that kind of slight sound is discovered, I immediately open my closed eyes. I am afraid of ghosts (although I do not believe in gods and ghosts). It is said that ghosts appear so quietly. This situation may be just me.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the fever subsided on the second day, otherwise, suspecting gods and ghosts, I was afraid that I would become neurasthenic.</p>
<p>Now everything is back to normal, it's just that my body is too tired and I need to rest for a few days. But I cherish ‘time flies like an arrow’ again. During the many days in the sickbed, couldn't I do a lot of work?</p>
<p>It’s another day, and the lights have been turned on in the room.</p>

<p>Opening "Pearl Tower Taoism"</p>
<p>Madam Sheng was angry and treated Fang Qing. How did she know that Fang Qing was a minister of the platform pavilion. She wanted, to humiliate the past wild words in person. Therefore, carefully seek the root of the current situation. Auntie scared, Nanyang wind and snow disaster star encountered, retreat from the disaster star and show auspicious stars. Once he was a champion, he was grateful for your kindness. Madam's face was happy in an instant. Saying that thousands of peach blossoms grow on one tree. Don't treat your aunt as an outsider. I am, inspiring you to achieve your ambition. Also asking you, uncle to give the tower at Jiusong Pavilion. Auntie scared, I don't measure my strength. Imitating Pi Lin. Eliminating traitors. Playing sage. Therefore, the champion was stripped of his position and suddenly became a civilian. Su Qin was originally Su Qin's generation. Fang Qing was originally the old Fang Qing. He re-overturned. Seven vertical captures. Trying out the previous snobbish heart. Also forcing, singing Taoism on the spot. Singing out, Uncle Dou's girl Su Ji's sister-in-law. Madam is, ashamed and angry. Fortunately, Chen Lian is good at resolving disputes. Suddenly reporting that a distinguished guest is coming to the gate. Taking that, renaming and re-engaging, thoroughly cleaning. Only the madam is like in a dream. Fang Qing is, taking the gold seal to support Cui Ping. In an instant, the suspicion is dispelled and the joy is born. The patrol case is, sincerely walking to the nunnery. Going to Baiyun Nunnery to see her mother. Mother and son are reunited and blood is close.</p>

<p>Movie</p>
<h3>Nanjing Screens ‘Rebellious Woman’</h3>
<p>Katharine Hepburn's Another blockbuster - "Rebellious Woman" will be released at the Nanjing Grand Theater today. The film is based on a script by British famous writer Nida Sai Lai. The script is vivid and powerful, displaying fearless love and the destruction of the spirit and flesh of thousands of trampled women with no effort. Katharine Hepburn has always been known for her performance of rebellious personality. In this film, she plays an oppressed woman in an old family with strict etiquette. She finally broke the gloomy and terrifying cage woven by men for thousands of years with her own self-confidence and perseverance. And through the power of words, she wants to make unfair voices for the women of the world. The film's supporting actors include Hanbo Marshall and Elisabeth Allan, the protagonist of "A Tale of Two Cities."</p>
<h3>Graduation Means Unemployment</h3>
<p>Life is precious, who is willing to give it away easily, especially a young man who has received higher education and has a future. But life is ultimately a ruthless whip, and under its attack and oppression, in helplessness, many useful people are walking towards this dead end—suicide—, are they willing to do this? No, definitely not, the entire cruel social environment is forcing them.</p>
<p>Yiming—the young man Xiao Xu in ‘Crossroads’—in order to obtain the means to maintain his life, and in order to improve human society, he carried an upward and kind heart and experienced layers of difficulties and dangers. He studied hard at ×× University. After four years of struggle, he finally graduated. At the time, he was indeed celebrating his good luck. But the square cap and diploma, in the current contradictory Chinese society, are worth a few cents, and there is only irony and ridicule. His beautiful vision fell through, and this dream was shattered by the reality of society. After graduation, he started to be unemployed.</p>
<p>Life became even more difficult, the depression of unemployment, coupled with the invasion of disease, the distant hometown, the expectation of the old mother, the bleak future, he could only secretly feel sad and shed tears.</p>
<p>In the twilight of a certain day, he—Yiming—leaned alone on a street lamp by the Huangpu River. The gray night enveloped him, and the sound of the river hit the shore. He stood there disappointedly and depressedly, feeling that there was no place for him in this society. After thinking it over and over again, he felt that there was only suicide, burying himself in the vast Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Rushing away at a rapid pace, at a very critical moment, Zhao Dan, who was also an unemployed young man, saw him and dragged him off the line of death at all costs, and persuaded him with warm comfort:</p>
<p>“Friend! Will your suicide improve this society”?</p>
<p>So these two poor companions returned to the Mingxing Second Factory under the direction of director Shen Xiling.</p>
<h3>"Thunderstorm" Story</h3>
<p>Original Author: Ostrovsky</p>
<p>Director: Zhang Min</p>
<p>In an old-fashioned family, there is a fierce and cold mother, Kapernova, who is very strict with her sons Qihong and daughter Varvara, especially harsh to her daughter-in-law, Kadalin, to the point of being inhumane. The active daughter couldn't bear it and later ran away with her lover, Kuder Ryucci. Even the cowardly son could hardly bear it and finally found a way to run away from life.</p>
<p>The daughter-in-law, Kadalin, suffered all kinds of abuse from her mother-in-law, and her husband only knew to drink to relieve his boredom and did not give her any comfort. In such a cold family, she simply had no interest in life. However, she was not a cowardly woman who was willing to live like this. In such distress, she accidentally fell in love with a young man named Boris, who was being tortured by his uncle and was very depressed. Seeing Kadalin, he also fell in love with her. Both of them thought they could comfort each other and feel some interest in life. At the same time, Kadalin felt that she was a married woman and should not love others again, but she could not bear the cruel and cold family. She suffered to the extreme in such two nights!</p>
<p>She couldn't bear it and finally confessed to her mother-in-law and husband to alleviate her pain; but the mother-in-law became even more severe to Kadalin when she heard about it, forcing her to have no place to live at home! Kadalin had no choice but to ask Boris for help; but Boris was being sent to another place by his uncle to do things and did not dare to agree to Kadalin's request, so they said goodbye to Kadalin and went their separate ways. Poor Kadalin, at this time ‘cannot return home’, and has nowhere to live outside. Finally, in that vast dark night, she threw herself into the Volga River to rest forever!</p>
