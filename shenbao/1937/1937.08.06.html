<p>歐洲通訊</p>
<h3>旅歐隨筆</h3>
<p>— 本報駐歐記者列山</p>
<p>希特勒是否也要結婚？</p>
<p>目前世界政治巨頭中，只有希特勒還是個單身漢子。自從英遜王愛德華八世（此日溫沙公爵）準備與辛泊生夫人結婚以後歐美新聞記者的目標，轉移到這位德國元首身上去。為什麽希特勒還沒有結婚呢。據德國人的解釋，領袖實因公務忙碌，無暇組織一個家庭。所謂英雄因國忘家。不過說了這句話後，連他們自己也笑起來。因為同是英雄的墨索里尼就是一位子女成行的家長，雖說他同他的太太意見不很融洽，只够不上作一模範的丈夫。有的人猜測，希特勒曾在欧戰時受了傷，有一種說不出口的苦處，所以不願意談到婚姻問題。德國目前是一個暢談種族問題的國家，而他們這個天才的領袖却無意於結婚，大家都覺得可惜。於是乎談來談去，許多人總念念不忘他的終身大事。</p>
<p>兩三年前，在各報上曾經流傳過一時，說是德國電影女明星李芬司塔兒是希特勒的情人。不但李女士當衆頌揚希特勒的才能，就希特勒也公開對人譽李女士為德國的女傑。不過他們兩人間到底如何的謎，雖經過善於探訪此類新聞的美國記者多方搜羅，仍感到材料不够豐富（例如去年首先發見愛德華八世與辛泊生夫人的戀愛事件的也是美國記者）日子一久大家也漸漸冷淡下來，好像德國元首眞的此生不願享受人間的家庭幸福了。</p>
<p>月來英美報紙又再度喧傳，德國另外一位電影女明星波拉妮格里將同希特勒結婚。這種傳說，是否可信，目前還很難說。妮格里原籍波蘭，據說已經結婚過兩次。日前巴黎晚報駐柏林記者特地同她作了一次談話，對於她是否就要結婚的問題，她說，那是十分可能的，她快要同一位很重要的德國人結婚。這位記者自然不肯放鬆進一步問她，那位未來的新郎是否一位最重要的德國人。妮格里旣不否認也不承認。她說，能說的話她都說了，再也不肯發表意見。不過後來她說，結婚地點將在柏林可是日期却保守秘密。她承認，婚後大約仍在柏林繼續居住下去。</p>
<p>新近德國宣傳部向德國各報發了一個通吿：根據領袖命令所調查的結果，女演員波拉妮格里是一位阿里安種的波蘭人，她有資格在德國工作。這個聲明到底是為誰而發的呢？</p>
<p>妮格里的未婚夫婿將是一位德國的要人，而這位要人是否就是希特勒，目前還是一個疑問。也許幾個星期以後我們就會知道，即是一宗謠傳呢還是事實。照記者個人的猜測，希特勒大約不至於如此。</p>
<p>寃家路狹</p>
<p>歷來許多人都覺得外交家可怕，因為他們口裏所說的同心裏所想的根本是兩回事。有一位大學教授公然宣佈外交家是個流氓。有幾位政治家更想替外交家提高人格，最少想替目前外交界打開一個新局面。所以年來在外交界中也有不少人會爭論到“耳紅面赤”的地步。有的人認為這是一種好現象，有的人呢却感到寒必，連外交家都到非口角不可的時候，世間還會太平麽？</p>
<p>主張說假話就是外交家的職業，這自然未免太過。但採取“村婦罵街”式的外交新方法，能否增加外交家本身的道德那始終是一問題。幾年來大家似乎都習慣於這種强硬外交的新姿態。好像應用原有的外交格式就是表示自己的軟弱無能。尤其是在西班牙事變中，這方面的外交家說話時，幾乎有見着對方就要一口呑下去的神氣。外交家也有這種凶臉相最少在近代史上是少見的。</p>
<p>此次英王喬治第六行加冕典禮時，照例也邀請各國特使到西明司特教堂中觀禮。各國的外交家旣然都碰在一起，於是乎主持加冕典禮事宜的幾位先生竟異想天開，乘這個機會開了一次玩笑。他們把德意蘇俄西班牙四國代表的坐位排在一個地方。讓他們大家臉對著臉，索性罵個痛快。這個幽默的辦法一位英國記者說，簡直近於將獅羊放在一處。</p>
<p>德國駐英大使李班特洛夫坐在西班牙駐英大使阿捷卡拉特的隔壁，德國軍事部長白倫堡大將却與西班牙人民陣綫政府代表倍司隄路為鄰。意大利駐英大使格蘭地伯爵與蘇俄外長李維諾夫坐在一排。而格蘭地夫人旁邊的一個人恰恰又是蘇俄的駐英大使邁斯基。在倫敦不干涉西班牙委員會中，格蘭地與邁斯基兩人互相責難是十分著名的。我們自然可以想像得到這幾位大人物在這三五小時中的苦况。也許他們不去討論政治問題只閒談天氣。在英國談論天氣，不但大家都有發牢騷的機會，甚至於更有同感。可惜我們打聽不出他們間談話的題目。</p>
<p>據說，這個惡作劇的方法，還是意大利人發明的。當新近墨索里尼在利比亞旅行的時候，意大利人把猶太通訊社記者與德國國社黨機關報記者排在一個汽車中讓他們飽嘗二種寃家路狹的滋味。而這一次呢，却又輪到意大利人自己身上來了！</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>資金動員</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>現在時局已經一天嚴重一天。我們要求和平。我們就得為和平而抗戰。這一點。我們相信大多數中國人都會這樣想的。最近各方軍事政治領袖的迅速集中。更表明了政府也已下了“為和平而抗戰”的决心。然而近代的軍事鬥爭。是否單僅是一個政治或軍火力量的對比呢。這顯然不是的。而最重要的背景。是經濟的力量。我們假若認定抗戰是我們唯一神聖的出路。那我們現在就不僅要迅速動員軍事。而且需要迅速動員經濟。</p>
<p>說到經濟動員。自然方面是很多。不過在目前最重要的。當然是如何迅速集合全國資金以作戰費的問題。我們知道從華北事變發生以後。在經濟上就發生了三件值得注意的事。第一件是公債的暴落。第二件是外匯需求的殷繁。第三件是烚金價格的飛漲。這三件經濟的事實。表面上好像是個個獨立的。但事實上却是一種有聯繫的。同時有礙抗戰的嚴重事態。說明白點。這三件事實是表示了一般都市中有錢的人。他們鋻於時局的危險。已紛紛拋出他們所有的公債。以吸收現款。再把這現款轉買外匯。流出海外。同時。這一現象更激動了一般內地的鄉下財主。於是他們唯一的方法。就是紛購飾金以窖藏。</p>
<p>一個資金逃避海外與資金窖藏的現象。在全國資金的集中動員上講。就是一種極嚴重的威脅。因此。我們為使將來作戰費用不致匱乏。我們現在就不能不趁早防止這種資金逃避的事態。而這種事態的防止。我們以為决不是一個“道德的說敎”可以奏功。換一句話說。我們以為政府應該運用最高的國家權力。强制的防止。這裏。最有効的手段。應該從速發布防止資本逃避法令。嚴禁以任何理由把資金流到海外去。同時。對外匯兌應從速實行管理統制。除掉軍需品及生活必要品的貿易。或其他眞正必要用途外。一律禁止購買外匯。同時。對於外匯的購買。應規定一定的限度。此外對於國民所有金銀。應强制的命令集中。限定每人的所有量。其餘都應由國家收換集中。這在貨幣對外價值的維持上。是有很大關係的。從而對於海外必要資源的獲得。就可以有相當的便利。不僅如此。更進一步我們覺得應該動員人民所有的外國證劵。呈獻國家作為戰費。</p>
<p>總之。中國現在已到了最後關頭。國家的運命就是個人的運命。我們不但希望政府應從速强制的實行資金動員。更希望有資力的國民。能受良心的驅使。不待政府的强制動員。而能够自動的先自奮起。</p>

<p>外國道契之土地徵收地捐、目前租界內大多數土地、均已向各外籍領事註冊、但有一小部份、仍執有中國道契、拒絕付捐九月前、工部局即認為此種事實為不公平、當决議向執有中國道契之地主徵收地捐、以示公允·在過去九個月中、部份中國道契地產、業已將地捐照付、但仍有拒付者、工部局以被輩同居租界內、一切權利均等、實無拒付理由、因此遂採取斷然行動云云、</p>

<h3>在舉國上下一致抗戰聲中我們應該注意的下層力量</h3>
<p>— 保蘆</p>
<p>蘆溝橋事件發生並擴大以後，凡是還有一點人心的，誰不憤慨，誰不奮起。這道理簡單極了：人家步步進逼，自己步步退讓，若再要退讓，那就祇有授首與敵了。那麽，為了死裏求生，難道還有第二條路？</p>
<p>這一次事件，也不止生死關頭的我們的同胞到了忍無可忍的地步；世界上的正義之士也莫不如是；除了口誅筆伐；美國洛杉磯就有機師三百餘人請求加入中國空軍作戰；而“一二八”之戰時美國義士蕭德便是最好的前例。</p>
<p>在於我們自己的同胞，旣已下了决心，準備犧牲一切，那自然更什麽也不計較，據四日報載：“日商在滬銀行朝鮮，台灣，正金，三菱，三井，住友及各航業公司，並各大紗廠之我國籍職員，自七月八日以來，紛紛自動辭職，截止今日，已有二百六十餘人，其中尤以幹部人才為多，十分之六已經退出，祇有買辦階級少許人，因留戀高俸，仍在猶豫中云。”</p>
<p>二百六十餘人，這數目固然不大，然而是“以幹部人才為多”，在此數上已是“十分之六”，所以在工作上所遭受的打擊，大概也已很可觀。至於“買辦階級”的“留戀高俸”，大概總要見了棺材，方動哭聲；而其他的做一日吃一天的工人，則為了家無隔宿之糧，我們實在不忍深責，有醒覺了的工友羣中，大概也不勝其痛苦吧。如果他們的生活有最低限度的辦法，我相信他們不僅將與幹部人才同樣的“紛紛辭職”，並且將立刻的成為救亡抗日的中堅，因為他們身受的壓迫和痛苦，便已够使他們明白日帝国主義者的面目了。</p>
<p>而與工人所同樣的，我們對已辭職的各日本商行的幹部人員，也不能無所表示，因為一，中國在目前祇有把所有的民衆結合在一起才能挽救危亡，我們的命運是同一的，更不能因為不替日本人服務是國民的天職而不管，因為他們是我們中間的一員；二，幹部人員和工人同樣，他們是親歷過日人的種種壓迫的，他們救亡抗戰的情緒一定很高，意志一定很强，就為了增加抗戰的力量，也不能放棄他們，讓他們各自作戰。</p>
<p>我們應該在總的目標下，放棄小我，把民族的利害為前提，援助他們並組織他們，使他們和全民大衆生活在一起，使他們在鐵的集團中成為他們的一員。</p>
<p>而其他尚未辭職的幹部人員，以及為生活所威脅仍在呑聲低首的工人們，我們也不能不替他們打算一下，使他們也成為我們鐵的戰士。</p>
<p>我們知道有許多喪盡天良的事是由生活造成的，那麽，我們為什麽要讓這許多有志之士徬徨無依，効力無從，或逼成不得已的漢奸呢！</p>
<h3>暴風雨</h3>
<p>— 田舍</p>
<p>一個黑色的大球，高高的，懸掛在江海關信號塔的巓頂，這是警報，狂風暴雨的警報哪！那黑球，沉重地，壓住每個人的心坎似的，感到鬱窒，苦悶，每個人的前途都似乎隱伏着一種莫可預測的危機，厄運。一個異乎尋常的遭遇將迫近眉睫，將沒有歧視地降臨到每個人的頭上。平靜的浦江；掀起了波濤，頻向兩岸衝擊，浪珠濺上岸，濺濕人們的鞋履。各路航綫都宣吿停止，旅人苦惱地携帶着行李，悵然折回。平日漂蕩來去的舢舨已經躲避了，只有幾艘巨輪，砲艦，烟囱微微冒烟，桅上的旗幟裂帛似的在飄，暴風雨將來襲擊的一剎那，寂寞的，寂寞的。</p>
<p>我靜止在寂寞的小屋裏，成為一個惡劣命運的期待者，我憂慮，憂慮我所安身的小屋太陳舊，經不起狂風暴雨的襲擊，危及生命，我又悔恨，悔恨自己的一再蹉跎，為什麽不未雨綢繆，把屋子修補一下呢？這計劃不是有過好幾回的，可是，每次都缺乏决心去實現，果然，現在要使這陳舊頹敗的牆垣和樑柱，去抵禦風雨的狂暴的侵襲，這不顯然是一種危機嗎！然而，憂慮和悔恨都是徒然的。連打支木樁，釘張鉛皮，在時間上已來不及，從怯弱的心理中生出個渺茫的希冀，希冀颶風能中途轉變方向，暴雨會消失於無形，一切都轉危為安，就這樣在空洞的祈望中，讓每個分碼消逝。</p>
<p>可是，暴風雨的幕序終於在屋外展開了，當我從白日的迷夢中醒來時，小屋的窗門被風刮得“格格”作響，豌豆般大的雨點打着窗格上的坡璃，如擊鼓鼙，屋頂上狂風像虎嘯獅吼，激動錯縱的電綫的弓弦，“嗚嗚”然，整個屋宇被震動了，灰泥“息息索索”打瓦縫落下，我擔心着屋宇會隨時傾坍。偶一瞑目，又如處身頂峯絕崖，站不住脚跟，如孤舟</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>顛簸於汪洋大海，將被巨浪捲去，想拚所有的氣力呼援，我失掉了自主，失掉了理智，把整個生命交給了命運。</p>
<p>除掉風聲‘呼呼’，雨聲‘嘩嘩’，再也聽不到别的聲息，附近那株大榆樹上，再後有蟬鳴傳來，瓦雀也不飛來簷下，連懸在椽上的篾籠裏的山蟲，也不想振翼歌唱，任憑暴雨狂風的呼嘯是多麽汹湧厲害，没有生物鳴呌的世界終於是凄凉的，寂寞的。‘噹啷’！我震驚，心怦怦跳躍，我疑有暴徒向我射擊，但我並未受傷，頓覺自己的愚妄，那裏有什麽暴徒！是狂風把窗格上的玻璃刮碎了，雨，立刻掃射進來，跟隨着風勢，屋裏濕了一片，書本報紙吹亂地上，蚊帳打着旋轉，電燈在空間摇曳，我受到陰寒的刺激，我蒙受重大的搗亂的損失，這是外係呵！</p>
<p>我急急用膠水紙張去糊補洞穿的窗格，冀風雨不再侵襲，可是無補實際，那薄薄的紙張再也抵抗不了暴風雨的全力的襲擊。屋瓦的裂縫裏又告漏水了，舖位，寫字桌，箱篋上……全都被雨水浸濕，連站足的地方都成了問題。風還在呼嘯，雨還在傾倒，可是，在極度險惡的環境，和極度怯弱的心理中，會陡然迸出莫大的勇氣，我索性披起雨衣，戴上雨帽，捲起被褥，把書報箱篋塞進牀底，我又找到了木板，釘子，油布，鐵錘，我預備冒險地爬上屋頂，走出門外，攀登簷下，開始我整個的抵抗暴風雨的工作，我不再坐捱襲擊，我不再把生命交給命運，我不再圖一温苟安的迷夢，不怕風雨如何的狂暴，我要拚出全部抵抗的力量！</p>
<h3>我們在鑄大刀</h3>
<p>— 耶戈</p>
<p>——報吿之一</p>
<p>為着修理幾件東西，我上街去找鐵匠。</p>
<p>古老，寬闊，不潔的街道，在八月的陽光下展開，蛋石路上蒸發着的是熱氣和人們的汗臭。鐵匠們散漫地在這街的兩旁，他們底陰暗的，齷齪的小屋住着。風箱呼呼的喘着氣，火爐隨着一熌一熌的吐出靑紅色火熖，往上沸騰着，像要用它血紅的舌尖去吸舐空中的氣息似的。在鐵砧前，站着的是三個煤黑的人，老年的師傅和他底年靑的徒弟。他們儘可能地拉長着裸赤的膀子，拖動鐵錘，砰砰的敲在一塊平凡而又醜陋的鐵條上。鐵絛是被火燒紅的，濺着赤紅的火星，慢慢的把身子拉寬，拉長，而鑄成大刀的模型。</p>
<p>鐵打的聲音，從鐵匠的髒污小屋飛出，混和着，洋溢住這古老的街衢，雄渾的，有節奏的。我按照着這節奏，踏着前進。</p>
<p>在第一家店門口，我站住了，並且說明來意。老師傅停止了他手中的工作，不耐煩的皺着眉，沉靜的聽我底話，於是，他搖搖頭，又敲起手中的鐵錘。</p>
<p>“沒有工夫！”他說。</p>
<p>年青的，粗壯的徒弟，用他污黑的手指抹一抹面上的汗珠，吐口涎沫在手心拿起鐵錘，用他師傅同一的聲調重複着，又砰砰的在鐵砧上敲打起來了。</p>
<p>“為什麽沒有工夫呢？”我懊惱了，鐵打的聲音使我感到昏眩。</p>
<p>“為什麽？”老鐵匠靜默地，當他把手中冰冷的鐵條重新放上火爐上時，就傲慢的抬起頭，厭煩的向我看了一眼。“我們在鑄大刀！”</p>
<p>慢慢的，他把手揮着，我就走開了。</p>
<p>到第二家，我一樣的在他們底骯髒的門口站住，向他們提出了同一的請求，並說明我願意付出比平常更高的代價。</p>
<p>“不！”他們這樣答覆我。“我們不能，我們在鑄大刀！”</p>
<p>於是他們揚手指給我看，在那兒，屋內陰暗的另一角落，擠着十幾個磨刀匠，和他們鑄成的大刀。我走了，到了第三家。</p>
<p>我底心，到這時已完全被好奇蒙住。我沒有提出我底請求，却簡單說出我底懷疑：</p>
<p>“好朋友，你們鑄了這許多大刀做什麽？”</p>
<p>“做什麽？”他們開始被鼓舞，而且亢奮起來了。“給前綫弟兄殺敵去！”聲調是充滿了那麽多的堅信和熱情，我受感動了。</p>
<p>一個老人，用他補釘的上褂抹着胸膛上的烟灰，從店內直走向我來。</p>
<p>“年靑的朋友，你需要着我們替你做點事吧？”</p>
<p>我點着頭，說明了我底來意。他微笑着，溫和的摸他蒼白的鬍子。</p>
<p>“你來遲了，我們都在鑄大刀。”</p>
<p>“整整的一條街？”我吃驚了。</p>
<p>“是的，整整的一條街，在前一天我們鑄好了三千把，今後我們還要繼續鑄下去，直到沒有一個敵人存在我們底國境。……”</p>
<p>我再也沒有勇氣走下去了。天氣非常晴朗，太陽在笑着。</p>
<p>我朝回家的路上走，背後是一陣鐵打的砰呌聲，好像是一陣大合唱，從每一個齷齪的鐵匠小屋飛出來，在空中匯注着，迴旋着。</p>
<p>“我们在鑄大刀！”鋼鐵的合唱這樣呌道。</p>
<p>“我們在鑄大刀！”我重複着唸，禁不住微笑了。</p>
<h3>森林</h3>
<p>— 長吉</p>
<p>從晨到晚，老鴉尖那塊陰濃茂盛的森林里，就“叮叮”“咚咚”的響起刀斧的聲音來；接着就是“沙啦”！“沙啦……啦”！一根一根的大樹都齊根倒了下來！這響聲是撼動了山谷，震慄了這山坡下每個農人底心。</p>
<p>當矮腿子要來伐木的消息，帶來給這羣忠厚農人知道底時候，他們是感到如何的悸怖啊！老鴉尖的森林，誰不知道是從他們的遠祖手里，就替兒孫辛辛苦苦的經管下來的。就是連最小的一根樹，也有幾十年的歷史了。他們是把這塊森林看得多麽的重要啊！不獨是他們相依活命的泉源，並且也是保障着他們這一村的風水：平常的時候，是誰也不敢去擅動一枝半葉的。為了外村人來偷竊他們的樹木，打仗流血的事情是時常發生的。在他們簡單的腦子里，祇有這一個千古不移的保守觀念！做父親的就該把這山森林傳到做兒子的手里，再讓兒子又傳給他的兒子；他們是這樣一代傳一代的永遠保管着這個相依活命的泉源；同時也不肯讓人家來破壞他們連繫一村衰盛的風水。這就是他們的責任，也是他們不違祖訓的村律。</p>
<p>但是誰也想不到，現在却來了這夥强蠻不講理的矮腿子，一句話也不開口，就擅自動起手來代勞他們開劈這山森林了。這實在是從來少見的罕事。自然村長要出頭來和他們評個理了，但是那有屁用：你評你的理，他伐他的樹。</p>
<p>於是村長結結巴巴的說：</p>
<p>“你們劈了我們的森林，那就是等如要了我們的命”。</p>
<p>“就要你的命！你敢怎樣”？</p>
<p>村長的臉氣靑了，一句話也說不出來。</p>
<p>“哼”！</p>
<p>那個把手槍仍舊藏進褲袋去，很得意的監視着這羣沒有武器的老實農人。</p>
<p>“叮叮”！“咚咚”！…………老鴉尖是一天到晚都嚮着這樣雜擾的刀斧聲：“沙啦”“沙啦……啦”！大的樹，小的樹；都先後的倒了下來，再從山上滾到山底下去。</p>
<p>現在老鴉尖是光濯濯的失去那塊蔭濃茂盛的森林了，祇剩下些刀斧的刦痕。</p>
<p>“咳！世界變了，還說他媽的王道樂土，連這幾百年保存下來的一片森林，也要遭了刦運啊”！</p>
<p>有的人到於今還是不忘疼痛的嗟憤着！</p>
<h3>保衛蘆溝橋</h3>
<p>蘆溝橋在北平西南，距前門十五公里，屬宛平縣，民國十七年劃北平為特別市，宛平縣治移設於此。石橋起於金代，金史河渠志稱大定二十七年（即宋孝宗淳熙十四年，西元一一八七年）建石橋，明昌三年（即宋光宗紹熙元年四元一一九〇年）成，賜名廣利。橋當南北交通道路，行人使客往來絡繹，馬哥波羅游記，盛稱此橋之宏大，可容十騎並列，因水溢橋圯，明清二代屢加重修，又以密邇燕京，置城防守，石橋長六十六丈，為環十有一孔。</p>

<h3>The Story of Capturing an Armored Vehicle</h3>
<p>A Certain Military Officer Speaks</p>
<p>[Baoding] According to a certain military officer who arrived in Baoding from Liulihe on the afternoon of the 4th, he told the story of our army capturing enemy armored vehicles and shooting down enemy aircraft. He said that on the morning of the 3rd, two enemy armored vehicles, carrying dozens of soldiers, were heading south from Liangxiang City. Our forward哨post部队unit received the report and immediately dispatched a guerrilla soldier to hide under a small bridge on the road. When the vehicle drove onto the bridge, he suddenly attacked it with a hand grenade, which hit the vehicle hole precisely. The vehicle was damaged and attempted to return, but collided with the vehicle behind it. Seeing the situation was not good, the enemy soldiers abandoned the vehicles and fled, leaving behind more than a dozen steel helmets, which were all obtained by our army. Also, on the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese aircraft shot down by our army was flying to reconnoiter our forward troops. It was flying very low and was shot down by our哨兵sentry兵 with a rifle, falling into a small village not far from the Japanese army's position in Liangxiang. Both Japanese pilots were killed. Our army immediately went forward to seize it, and the enemy army also rushed to rescue it, but was repelled by our army. Because the aircraft was half-sunken in the mud, it was inconvenient to transport. Our army removed the markings and parts from the aircraft and then destroyed the aircraft with bombs. The captured aircraft markings and steel helmets have now been transported to Baoding for reporting. (5th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>European Correspondence</p>
<h3>Random Notes of a Traveler in Europe</h3>
<p>— Lie Shan, Our Correspondent in Europe</p>
<p>Will Hitler Also Marry?</p>
<p>Among the major political figures in the world today, only Hitler remains a bachelor. Since King Edward VIII of England (now the Duke of Windsor) prepared to marry Mrs. Simpson, the focus of European and American journalists has shifted to the German leader. Why hasn't Hitler married? According to Germans, the Führer is too busy with official duties to form a family. The so-called hero forgets his family for the sake of his country. But after saying this, even they laugh. After all, Mussolini, also a hero, is a parent with many children, although he and his wife do not get along very well and are not exactly a model couple. Some speculate that Hitler was injured in the First World War and has an unspeakable affliction, so he is unwilling to talk about marriage. Germany today is a country that talks a lot about racial issues, but their brilliant leader has no intention of marrying, which everyone finds regrettable. So, talk goes back and forth, and many people can't forget his lifelong event.</p>
<p>Two or three years ago, it was rumored in the newspapers that the German film star Leni Riefenstahl was Hitler's lover. Not only did Ms. Riefenstahl publicly praise Hitler's talent, but Hitler also openly praised Ms. Riefenstahl as a German heroine. However, the mystery of what exactly happened between them, although American journalists, who are good at searching for this kind of news, collected information from various sources, still felt that the materials were not rich enough (for example, it was also an American journalist who first discovered the love affair between Edward VIII and Mrs. Simpson last year). As time went on, everyone gradually became indifferent, as if the German leader really did not want to enjoy the happiness of a family in this life.</p>
<p>In recent months, British and American newspapers have once again reported that another German film star, Pola Negri, is going to marry Hitler. Whether this rumor is credible is still difficult to say. Negri is originally from Poland and is said to have been married twice. Recently, the Paris Evening News correspondent in Berlin had a special conversation with her. Regarding the question of whether she was going to get married, she said that it was very possible and that she was going to marry a very important German. This reporter naturally refused to let go and further asked her if the future groom was the most important German. Negri neither denied nor admitted it. She said that she had said all that she could say and would not express any further opinions. But later she said that the wedding location would be in Berlin, but the date would be kept secret. She admitted that she would probably continue to live in Berlin after the marriage.</p>
<p>Recently, the German Propaganda Ministry issued a notice to the German newspapers: according to the results of an investigation ordered by the Führer, the actress Pola Negri is an Aryan Pole and is qualified to work in Germany. Who was this statement issued for?</p>
<p>Negri's fiancé will be an important German, but whether this important person is Hitler is still a question. Perhaps in a few weeks we will know whether it is a rumor or a fact. According to the reporter's personal speculation, Hitler probably wouldn't go that far.</p>
<p>The Narrow Road of Enemies</p>
<p>Many people have always found diplomats to be terrible, because what they say and what they think are completely different things. One university professor publicly declared that diplomats are hooligans. Several politicians wanted to improve the character of diplomats, or at least wanted to open up a new situation in the current diplomatic world. Therefore, in recent years, many people in the diplomatic world have argued to the point of "red ears and flushed faces." Some people think this is a good phenomenon, while others feel uneasy. If even diplomats have to resort to verbal disputes, will the world be at peace?</p>
<p>To argue that lying is a diplomat's job is naturally too much. But whether adopting a new diplomatic method like a "village woman scolding in the street" can increase the morality of diplomats themselves is always a question. In recent years, everyone seems to have become accustomed to this new posture of tough diplomacy. It seems that using the original diplomatic format is a sign of one's weakness and incompetence. Especially in the Spanish incident, when diplomats spoke in this regard, they almost seemed ready to swallow their opponents in one bite. Diplomats with such fierce faces are rare, at least in modern history.</p>
<p>During the coronation ceremony of King George VI of England, envoys from various countries were invited to Westminster Abbey as usual. Since diplomats from various countries were all together, several gentlemen in charge of the coronation ceremony had a whimsical idea and took the opportunity to play a joke. They arranged the seats of the representatives from Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and Spain in one place. They had them face each other, so they could scold each other to their heart's content. One British reporter said that this humorous method was almost like putting lions and lambs together.</p>
<p>The German Ambassador to England, Ribbentrop, sat next to the Spanish Ambassador to England, Ateca. The German Minister of War, General von Blomberg, was next to Bastillo, the representative of the Spanish Popular Front government. The Italian Ambassador to England, Count Grandi, sat in a row with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Litvinov. And the person next to Countess Grandi was none other than the Soviet Ambassador to England, Maisky. In the London Non-Intervention Committee on Spain, Grandi and Maisky were well-known for accusing each other. We can naturally imagine the hardship of these big figures in those three or five hours. Perhaps they didn't discuss political issues and just chatted about the weather. In England, talking about the weather not only gives everyone a chance to complain, but also to feel a sense of commonality. Unfortunately, we can't find out the topic of their conversation.</p>
<p>It is said that this prank was invented by the Italians. When Mussolini recently traveled in Libya, the Italians put a Jewish news agency reporter and a German National Socialist Party newspaper reporter in the same car so that they could fully experience the bitterness of enemies on a narrow road. And this time, it was the Italians' turn!</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Mobilizing Capital</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>The current situation is getting more serious every day. We demand peace. We must fight for peace. We believe that most Chinese people will think this way. The recent rapid concentration of military and political leaders from all parties further shows that the government has made the determination to "fight for peace." However, is modern military struggle simply a comparison of political or military strength? Obviously not. The most important background is economic strength. If we recognize that resistance is our only sacred path, then we must not only quickly mobilize the military, but also quickly mobilize the economy.</p>
<p>Speaking of economic mobilization, there are naturally many aspects. However, the most important thing at present is how to quickly gather national funds for war expenses. We know that since the North China Incident, three noteworthy things have happened in the economy. The first is the plummeting of public bonds. The second is the eagerness for foreign exchange demand. The third is the soaring price of gold jewelry. These three economic facts seem to be independent of each other on the surface, but in fact they are a kind of interconnected and serious situation that hinders resistance. To put it bluntly, these three facts show that wealthy people in general cities, seeing the danger of the situation, have successively sold off all their public bonds to absorb cash, and then bought foreign exchange with this cash to flow overseas. At the same time, this phenomenon has further stimulated the general wealthy landlords in the countryside, so their only method is to buy jewelry and hoard it.</p>
<p>A phenomenon of capital flight overseas and capital hoarding is a very serious threat to the centralized mobilization of national capital. Therefore, in order to prevent the future lack of war funds, we must now prevent this capital flight as soon as possible. And we believe that preventing this situation will not be achieved by "moral persuasion." In other words, we believe that the government should use the highest national power to forcibly prevent it. Here, the most effective means should be to promptly issue a law to prevent capital flight, strictly prohibiting funds from flowing overseas for any reason. At the same time, foreign exchange should be quickly managed and controlled. Except for the trade of military supplies and essential goods for daily life, or other truly necessary uses, the purchase of foreign exchange should be prohibited. At the same time, a certain limit should be set for the purchase of foreign exchange. In addition, all gold and silver owned by the people should be forcibly ordered to be concentrated, limiting the amount owned by each person, and the rest should be collected and exchanged by the state. This is of great importance in maintaining the external value of the currency. Consequently, it can be quite convenient to obtain necessary resources from overseas. Not only that, but further, we feel that we should mobilize all foreign securities owned by the people and present them to the country as war expenses.</p>
<p>In short, China has now reached the final juncture. The fate of the country is the fate of the individual. We not only hope that the government will quickly and forcibly implement capital mobilization, but we also hope that citizens with capital can be driven by conscience, without waiting for the government's forced mobilization, and can automatically rise up on their own.</p>
<h3>British China Friendship Association Condemns Government</h3>
<p>For Not Tolerating Japan</p>
<p>[London] The president of the British China Friendship Association, Earl Listowel, today sent a letter to the Manchester Guardian, publishing important arguments regarding the Far East situation, stating that the recurrence of Japanese aggression against China may cause dangerous disputes, and expressing doubts about Britain's lack of action. Lord Listowel stated that the insatiable expansion policy of the Japanese military warlords is now increasingly obvious, and it is extremely clear that this matter is sufficient to promote a world war. Therefore, the most important thing is that if China invokes Article 17 of the League of Nations Covenant and makes a request, Britain should provide assistance. The letter concluded by asking the government to immediately convene a conference of the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to discuss methods of resolution and restore peace based on justice.

<h3>Agreement Reached Between China and Britain with Approval from U.S., France, and Belgium</h3>
<p>Details of Loan Issuance Under Discussion; Vice President Kong and His Party Arrive in Paris</p>
<p>[London] Since the announcement of the news that China will issue 20 million pounds of bonds in London, it has aroused deep interest. The moral effect of the establishment of this agreement, as it is sufficient to express confidence in China's future without doubt, is believed to have an extremely beneficial influence. Furthermore, the Reuters reporter's issuance of this news comes from a very reliable source, and it is heard that the United States, France, and Belgium have all expressed excitement and approval for the establishment of this agreement. However, the details of the issuance of this loan are still under discussion, and this work is extremely heavy. Naturally, in the current chaotic situation in the Far East, there is no intention to issue it for the time being. Furthermore, although there are preparations for war between China and Japan, people in London deeply feel that there must be a solution, because the outbreak of war is equivalent to mutual suicide. In the market, although the bonds of both China and Japan have fallen sharply, in fact, there is very little selling, and from today onwards, the buying side has gradually shown signs of activity.

<p>[London] Dr. Kong Xiangxi left England for France this evening (4th) with advisors Guo Bingwen, Secretaries Chen Bingzhang, Chen Liting, Hu Yigu, and others. Today in England, Kong signed a contract with the China Central Railway Company for the second batch of 4 million pounds of loans for the Puxin Railway. This loan will be secured by the income of the Puxin Railway. If the railway income is insufficient, the salt revenue will be used as a guarantee. It is also heard that Kong has reached an agreement in principle with British financiers on a large amount of loans. It is learned that in addition to this loan, Kong has signed a contract in England for a 3 million pound loan for the Guangmei Railway. (Central News Agency dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senator Proposes Withdrawal of Troops Stationed in Pingjin</h3>
<p>To Avoid Conflict with Japanese Troops</p>
<p>[Washington] Illinois Democratic Senator Lewis recently delivered a speech in the Senate, advocating that the United States withdraw all troops stationed in Peiping and Tianjin in accordance with the Boxer Protocol. The Boxer Protocol was established after the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. The current situation is different, so the Boxer Protocol has lost its effectiveness. If American troops continue to be stationed in the Pingjin area today, it may be enough to cause accidents similar to the recent conflicts between French and Japanese troops. Even American expatriates should withdraw from North China. It is said that Lewis's views are the same as those of most army officers, and people do not find it surprising. However, so far, the State Department does not agree with this view. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch on the 4th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Opposes Establishing Chemical Warfare Unit</h3>

<h3>Russian Newspaper Strongly Condemns Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>British and American Adoption of a Compromising Policy Only Serves to Encourage Japanese Military Arrogance</p>
<p>[Moscow] Today's Pravda, in discussing the international situation, strongly condemned Japanese aggression in North China, and said that the retrogression and compromising policy of Britain and the United States is sufficient to encourage the conspiracies of Japanese "bandits." As a result, Japan disregarded everything, acted arbitrarily, and chose the path of least resistance, driving straight into the interior of China. Today, what the Japanese military warlords recognize is the omnipotence of force, and how to eliminate these military warlords is what all countries with the will to maintain peace should jointly implement international action. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch on the 5th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] "Pravda" comments on the international situation, stating that "The characteristic of the entire diplomatic line of Britain at present is a policy of compromise with aggressors, and this policy is of great harm to its own interests. Britain should have known this undeniable fact long ago. Today, in the Far East, the Japanese military warlords completely disregard British interests in China, and plunder as if they were bandits, which is a practical lesson for Britain."</p>
<p>"At the same time, the result of Britain's condoning of fascist Germany has made the military preparations of this aggressor country expand day by day, and London is cultivating a second equally terrible enemy."</p>
<p>"Finally, the tortuous and complicated development of British-Italian relations in recent years has also proved that tolerating fascist bandits only promotes their appetite. As a result of Britain's adoption of this line, it has lost its stable strategic position in the Mediterranean, and Britain has cultivated a third enemy in Italy."</p>
<p>Pravda finally commented on the exchange of letters between Mussolini and Chamberlain, and Eden's upcoming trip to Italy, saying, "Britain is now preparing to formally recognize Italy's annexation of Albania, hoping to bargain and get some concessions from Germany and Italy regarding the Spanish incident. At the same time, Britain intends to create a rift in the so-called Rome-Berlin axis, because the threat of this axis to Britain is growing. Britain is working hard to compromise with Italy, but we can predict that it will still be London that will make concessions." (TASS dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Discusses the North China Incident, Filled with an Atmosphere of Escalation</h3>
<p>This Year's Budget Totals Over 3.4 Billion Yen; Additional Military Expenses for Invading China are Under Review</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At the House of Representatives meeting on the 4th, Seiyukai member Shigemasa Sunada questioned the government, stating that the policy of non-expansion initially decided upon during the North China Incident had reached a situation where it could not be changed. At this time, a fundamental solution should be sought for the North China issue. The government should decide on a strategy based on the national determination in order to thoroughly resolve it. Prime Minister Konoe replied that the so-called effort to prevent the situation from escalating meant a local solution, which remains unchanged even today. If the situation expands in the future, the responsibility lies with China. Japan will still follow its established policy to quickly resolve the situation. If it reaches the worst-case scenario, then we will consider appropriate measures on a case-by-case basis. Kokumin Domei member Ichiro Kiyose also asked that the Japanese military action seeks to eradicate anti-Japanese education. In order to achieve this goal, there is no need to adhere to the non-expansion policy. The current tax increase is a bit too small. Finance Minister Kaya replied that Japan does not need to exert all its strength to deal with an incident that occurred in a corner of Hebei Province, because Japan is not such a small country. Therefore, the degree of tax increase is very appropriate. The replies of Konoe and Kaya had important implications. The Kokumin Domei mostly criticized Kaya's replies, which may cause a small disturbance. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At the House of Representatives Special Tax Law Committee this morning (5th), when deliberating on the additional budget for the North China Incident, Minseito member Yatadaji Nakajima asked whether the army expenses in this additional budget are sufficient to support it until the opening of the regular Diet session, and whether the navy expenses are prepared for a third country. Army Minister Sugiyama replied that with the central army heading north, it is truly doubtful how long the Japanese army can maintain its current posture. If the central army challenges, we will immediately rise up to respond, and we are fully prepared. As for the expenses, they are still sufficient at present. If the situation deteriorates, the current budget will naturally be insufficient. We will petition for the convening of an extraordinary Diet session and seek appropriate countermeasures. However, its timing cannot be predicted at present. Navy Minister Yonai replied that the navy has no preparations for any third country. (Central News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance of Japan Considers Transporting Cash to England</h3>

<h3>Britain Actively Completes Air Force Expansion Plan</h3>
<p>A Total of 123 Squadrons Nationwide, 1,500 First-Line Aircraft</p>
<p>United States Prepares to Build New Warships to Replace Old Ones</p>
<p>[London] Britain's air force expansion plan is actively being completed. According to the latest official statistics, the British Air Force has 123 squadrons, an increase of 137 percent compared to 1935. Among them are 1,542 first-line aircraft, only 208 short of the original plan of 1,750 aircraft. 900 of these aircraft are specifically for use in colonies and by the navy. They are all the latest models, comparable to the best aircraft in the world. The light bombers, even with extremely heavy loads, can fly long distances at a speed of 460 kilometers per hour. The weapons equipped on the new fighter planes are especially sophisticated, and their speed can reach 500 kilometers per hour. Personnel matters have also been decided, and a large number of reserves have been trained. Since April 1935, there have been 3,500 pilots. The number of applicants for admission as pilots and wireless operators has also increased proportionally. In addition, the Air Ministry has recently acquired Heston Aerodrome near London. According to the "Evening Standard," it must be expanded to become the largest airport in the London area. It is also planned to purchase nearby private land to build a runway one and a half miles long for large aircraft to take off and land. At the same time, it is also planned to build a railway branch line between the airport and Paddington Station for connection. (5th Central News Agency Havas Dispatch from Havana)</p>
<p>[Washington] Rear Admiral Leahy, Chief of Naval Operations, recently announced that the US government's policy on building warships is still based on the tonnage stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty. The new ships to be built in the future will be used to replace old ships that have reached the end of their service life. Among them, two battleships have reached the end of their service life and will be replaced by two 35,000-ton battleships to be built next year. Although the United States' shipbuilding program does not compete with Britain, if other countries expand their navies, the US Navy's shipbuilding program will naturally take this into consideration.

<h3>Britain Begins Diplomatic Activities to Create World Peace</h3>
<p>Britain and Italy Resolve Differences and Reconcile, Turning Point in European Situation Emerging</p>
<p>[London] It was learned today that Britain has begun diplomatic action to create world peace, and the actual work of the plan will be implemented in the autumn. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] According to well-informed sources here, the exchange of friendly letters between British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is unlikely to be followed by mutual visits due to the current summer vacation. At the same time, according to Count Ciano, the Italian Foreign Minister, a path to complete understanding between Britain and Italy has now been opened. Ciano's statement implies that he and British Foreign Secretary Eden have reached a partial understanding. It is generally believed that this is more important to European peace than the unanimous agreement of all members of the Non-Intervention Committee. Furthermore, Ciano also stated that the political axis between Rome and Berlin has not weakened. People here see this as another solid barrier to European peace. (4th "North China Daily News" Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the reconciliation between Britain and Italy, Italian sources here believe that if the two sides conduct negotiations in the future, the issue of de jure recognition of Italy's annexation of Abyssinia is one of the main issues that should be resolved in the negotiations. British diplomatic circles also admit that this issue must be discussed one day, but the method of resolving it is quite difficult. Italy currently insists that the Abyssinian Embassy in Britain must be closed down. Therefore, merely expelling Abyssinia from the League of Nations is not enough to resolve the issue. Well-informed British sources believe that Britain will now recognize Italy's annexation in some way, so that the prestige of both the League of Nations and Italy can be preserved. However, Britain must first seek France's consent before taking any action. Abyssinian sources here say that if Britain recognizes the annexation, Emperor Selassie is prepared to resist and, if necessary, may go to Geneva to attend the League of Nations General Assembly in an attempt to salvage the situation. Selassie is currently consulting various legal experts, including Professor Sist of the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris. (Note: When the League of Nations held an extraordinary meeting in May of this year, the Abyssinian Emperor originally planned to send a delegation chairman, but Professor Sist dissuaded him, and the plan was abandoned.

The content stated that Britain's policy in the Mediterranean was aggressive. He asked for Germany's opinion and requested clarification. If Germany could issue a statement preparing to assist Italy, war could be avoided; otherwise, if war broke out, Italy would be defeated miserably, and Germany would follow suit. It was also heard that Head of State Hitler had sent a reply to Mussolini. Responsible officials have firmly denied this claim, saying that the political axis formed by Italy and Germany is still operating as usual, and there is no need to adopt such an extraordinary procedure.

Its intentions are extremely suspicious, and the Finnish government is actually supporting it. The Finnish authorities are now sending frequent overtures to Germany, which shows that they have abandoned the cause of peace in the Baltic Sea."

<h3>Iraq Sends Note to the League of Nations Opposing the Partition of Palestine</h3>
<p>World Zionist Congress Chairman Weizmann Delivers Stirring Speech</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Iraqi government recently sent a note to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, protesting the plan stipulated in the British Royal Commission report to divide Palestine into Arab and Jewish states and a mandated territory, stating that the territorial integrity and independence of Palestine were solemnly declared by the Mandates Commission and the League of Nations Covenant. The current British plan runs counter to this. According to this plan, there is no hope of a permanent solution to the Palestinian national question. To thoroughly resolve this question, it is necessary to recognize Palestine's complete independence and allow the Jewish people, in their current situation, to recognize their minority status forever. This issue is closely related to Iraq, so the Iraqi government will submit a supplementary note to the League of Nations in the future, listing various detailed recommendations on how to resolve this issue.

<p>⊙Zurich, Switzerland The World Zionist Congress recently continued its meeting here. Professor Weizmann, chairman of the Zionist Association, delivered a speech criticizing the British administration in Palestine. First, he described the events in Palestine in 1929, then the unrest that occurred in Palestine last year, saying that the scope of the disturbances had expanded to such an extent that it was difficult to understand. Afterwards, although British troops were sent to the area, they did nothing to stop the spread of the unrest. As for the report submitted by the British Royal Commission, it cannot be discussed at present. If you want to discuss it, you must resolve two prerequisite questions first. One is to establish a Jewish national residential area in Palestine, and the other is to find a suitable place in Palestine to accommodate two million Jewish immigrants. The mandated system has not been implemented, and this is due to the lack of determination of the Palestinian administrative authorities. We publicly state that we are absolutely opposed to restricting the number of Jews to be transplanted to Palestine. We are always prepared to hold negotiations with the Arab nation, but on the condition that the rights of Jews in Palestine are recognized. Afterwards, Ussishkin, a representative of Palestinian Jews, spoke, saying, "The Jewish nation is now strong enough to reject the plan proposed by Britain and propose other plans. Since we are a nation, we have rights in our own land. If we must engage in fighting to achieve our goals, then we will engage in fighting and achieve final victory in the fighting. In short, the principle of dividing a part of Palestine's territory to establish a Jewish state is firmly opposed by us." Finally, the Congress elected Ussishkin as chairman of this Congress.

<p>Hankou Communication. Japanese expatriates from Zhengzhou, Chongqing, Changsha, and Yichang and Shashi in Hubei Province have recently gathered in Hankou and transferred to Shanghai to return home. In recent days, hundreds of people have been heard of. Among the Japanese expatriates in Hankou, in addition to the strong men who remain to be organized into civil police teams, the elderly, weak, women, and children are also preparing to return home. On the 2nd of this month, the Japanese acting consul in Hankou suddenly issued an order limiting the elderly, weak, women, and children to leave Hankou for Shanghai by the 4th to return home in a concentrated manner. After the order was issued, there was quite a commotion in the Japanese concession. Also, dozens of retired soldiers in Hankou received an order from Chang Yong, the head of the China branch of the Retired Soldiers Association, forwarded by Tanimoto, commander of the Japanese Marine Corps stationed in Hankou, to return to Tokyo on the evening of the 3rd, led by Tawada Katsumi, chairman of the Retired Soldiers Association in Hankou, and Morizawa Goro, vice chairman, on the Daitei Maru to enlist in the army. Japanese businesses operating in Hankou have largely come to a standstill. Over 1,000 Chinese workers from factories such as Taian Yarn Factory, Gongda, Matsumoto, Fukuda, and Hirokawa have voluntarily resigned en masse, and jointly declared, advising Japanese businesses to quickly stop the government's acts of aggression to avoid the breakdown of relations between the peoples of the two countries. Chinese staff in various foreign firms have also resigned one after another. In the Japanese concession and on the river, only sandbags, wire fences, gun emplacements, and warships are prominent. Other civilized decorations are extremely rare.</p>
<p>The Wuhan Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission recently uncovered four traitors, Wu Bingzhang, Feng Shutang, Chen Ce, and Tao Jianqing, who confessed to colluding with the enemy and signing long-term smuggling contracts. They were sentenced to death and executed by shooting on the 3rd. (August)</p>
<h3>Earthquakes in Various Counties in Shandong, Heze County Suffers the Worst Damage</h3>
<p>Houses Collapsed in Cities and Towns, Ground Cracked, More Than 50 Casualties</p>
<p>Jinan Communication. Earthquakes occurred in various counties on the 1st of this month. The reports from the counties at that time were mostly brief, and the location of the epicenter was mostly unclear. However, what is known is that the Cao Prefecture area in western Shandong seemed to be more severely affected, especially Heze County. The county experienced multiple earthquakes in one day, causing houses to collapse. The afternoon was especially violent, with shaking and dizziness, like a small boat in a vast sea. Coupled with wind and rain, the sky was dark, like mountains and seas overturning. As a result, all the houses in the county collapsed completely, and transportation was completely destroyed. Women and children stood in the streets in the rain, their cries shaking the sky, and the order was chaotic. Officials and civilians were busy with disaster relief and had no time to report the details to the province. After one night, on the 2nd, the aftershocks continued intermittently. That morning, the Long-Distance Telephone Management Office of the Construction Department received a telegram from the Heze branch office, stating that the earthquake situation in Heze had been reported by telegram in the morning. After noon, the tremors continued, and at 5:30, there were four or five more violent tremors. The houses in the county seat had almost all collapsed and were still shaking. Staff members had not eaten all day, although they had no serious injuries. However, by the afternoon, telecommunications were still out of service. However, according to a telephone report from Jinning, "There were collapses in Heze County, springs were gushing out, houses were almost completely collapsed, and there were more than 50 casualties." That evening at 7:00, according to a telephone report from Juye, "No houses in Ze City and the surrounding villages are complete. The ground more than ten miles west is cracked, and black water and quicksand are gushing out." Also, the Department of Education received a telegram from the Second Township Construction Normal School in Heze stating that "Several buildings at the school have collapsed, and several workers have been injured." The fellow villagers of Cao Prefecture in Jinan were extremely saddened upon hearing the news and are now planning relief efforts.</p>

The electric light wire erected in Jia Lane, Jingde Road in the city was also broken and fell to the ground by the wind on the evening of the 3rd. At that time, the nearby residents reported to the telegraph company and asked them to repair it to avoid danger. The company received the report but ignored it. On the morning of the 4th, at about 9:00 AM, Wu Musheng, a gardener, passed by the area, unaware of the danger, and opened it by hand, causing him to be electrocuted and killed on the spot. After passers-by discovered it, they reported to the company to cut off the power line, and asked the local prosecutor's office to send someone to inspect the body and hand it over to the family for burial.</p>

<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Lao Bao Cheng Gold Shop Robbed</p>
<p>At 8:30 PM on the 3rd, during the heavy wind and rain, two robbers dressed in fancy clothes suddenly came to the Lao Bao Cheng Gold and Jewelry Store on Datieqiao Street, inside the North Gate, and said they wanted to buy gold jewelry. The shop assistant Wu Yingji greeted them. The robbers then said that because they were passing by, they needed to borrow 5,000 yuan in legal tender. Immediately, they took out a pistol and threatened him. They robbed gold rings, gold bracelets, etc., weighing a total of 24 taels, and shot the shop assistant Yu Fusheng before fleeing. The shop reported to the guard office, and police officers Xing Fucai and Song Haoyou tried their best to chase them. Along Xicheng Jiao to Ximen Bridge, the police and the robbers exchanged gunfire, causing police officer Xing Fucai to be shot and wounded by the robbers. Afterwards, the Ximen Police Station Water Patrol Team and others cooperated in the pursuit, and the two robbers were captured near Xixin Bridge.

They had previously committed a robbery in Dongting and hired a car to escape after the robbery, but they were unexpectedly arrested. They have now been detained together.</p>
<p>Discussing Security Measures</p>
<p>Shi Kuiling, commander of the Second District Security, recently summoned the leaders of various senior military and local agencies concerned to a security discussion meeting on the 4th, due to the tense situation and Wuxi's strategic location. They discussed strict measures and decided to organize a joint military and police inspection office in Wuxi County to ensure local security.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Traffic Not Yet Restored After Storm</p>
<p>This area was hit by a Pacific typhoon, starting on the night of the second and lasting until the morning of the fifth. Losses in all directions have been extremely heavy. Most of the boats and steamers in various villages have not yet resumed sailing, and traffic is still blocked. The electricity and telephone companies have been sending craftsmen to repair the lines for days. As of the morning of the fifth, only one-third had been repaired. Cotton and rice fields in the Jiaotang area of the Fifth District have been damaged. The heads of various towns have reported the disaster to the district office one after another. District Chief Xu Shoukang has already reported this to the county government for instructions.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Fengxin Grain Harvest Bountiful</p>
<p>In the eastern townships of Fenghua, the new grain has already been harvested. Because the rainfall this year has been relatively even, the harvest is extremely bountiful. The best fields yield more than 300 catties [approximately 397 pounds], while ordinary fields can yield about 250 catties [approximately 331 pounds]. The farmers are all overjoyed.</p>
<p>Large-Scale Bad Check Swindler Discovered</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Customs Supervisory Office seized a large quantity of untaxed seafood from the home of resident Ye Tongyuan near Fuming Station in eastern Yin County the other day. Unexpectedly, just as the case was being investigated, personnel from the Jufeng Seafood Company of Shanghai came to Ningbo. It was then discovered that the goods had been obtained from the company by Fan Ziying using bad checks totaling more than 10,000 yuan [approximately $1,400]. The company has now filed a complaint with the Yin County District Procuratorate, suing Fan and Ye.</p>
<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Japanese Account Found to Be Inaccurate</p>
<p>It was reported that five Japanese in plain clothes were discovered taking pictures and drawing diagrams at Xinhu Haitang [New Protection Sea Dike], thirty li [approximately 9 miles] from Qianjiaqiao Town. At the time, this was based on a personal report from someone from the area. After investigation by various Party and government officials, the truth seems to be otherwise. It is said that the people in the area caught a glimpse of a dark shadow with wisps of smoke on the sea outside Xinhu Haitang. Fearing it was an enemy ship, they gathered a few people and waded out to investigate after the tide receded, leading to the misunderstanding.</p>

The Jian Guo, Wu Ling, Zhi Tai, Min Gui, Zhang De, Hua De, Ping Yang, Da Qing, Hong Yuan, Hong Li, Tian Ku, Hote Menshan Diweikan, Nan Ning, Rui Yang Maru, Tang Shan, and other ships on various Yangtze River and coastal routes have all left port one after another yesterday. At the same time, the Jefferson, Ning Xing, Xin Jiang Tian, Fu Li, Pusi Bao, Ge Lin Fuer, Luo Yang Maru, Yangzi, Jiang He, Wuchang, Ji He, Ning Hai, Tai Li, Panama, and other ships entered port. China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong, Wuhan, and Eurasia Aviation Corporation’s Shanghai-Guangdong, Shanghai-Xinjiang, and other flights also resumed as usual yesterday morning. According to a report from the Xujiahui Observatory, the typhoon passed through Anhui Province and is moving north. At 6:00 AM yesterday, it reached Xuzhou in Jiangsu Province and continued to move north. By 2:00 PM, it had entered Shandong Province, at 35 degrees north latitude and 117 degrees east longitude. The wind direction is north or northwest, the center is still 60 nautical miles away, the wind force is unknown, and it is moving between Tianjin and Yantai. As a result, there is overcast rain and strong swirling winds in Shandong, while there is sunny weather with clouds and thunder in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River. In the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the East Sea around Taiwan, there is sunny weather with clouds and strong southeast to north winds. There were still strong winds in this port yesterday, which was its influence. Furthermore, the Observatory also discovered yesterday that a new typhoon has arisen near Yap Island in the South Pacific (this is the fourth one), and it seems to be moving northwest.</p>
<p>The Da Gong News Agency reports that the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Pingjin line has been temporarily suspended since the start of the Pingjin War, and the China National Aviation Corporation has been reduced to Qingdao. The flights are still twice a week on Wednesdays and Saturdays. However, as the situation becomes increasingly tense and Qingdao is showing signs of instability, passengers heading south are extremely crowded. It is reported that the China National Aviation Corporation is aware of the situation and has decided to add flights starting today, changing to one flight per day. The flight times, except for Wednesdays and Saturdays, will remain at 6:15 AM, and on other days, it will be 6:30 AM. The departure time from Qingdao to Shanghai will be 9:00 AM every day.</p>
<h3>Kawagoe Shigeru Arriving from Vietnam</h3>
<p>Kawagoe Shigeru, the Japanese Ambassador to China, acting on instructions from Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota, took the Qingdao Maru southward from Dalian on the 5th and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. While in Shanghai, Kawagoe will summon senior consular officials and military attachés to discuss the China policy before entering Beijing. Furthermore, Dalian Allied News Agency reported on the 5th that Kawagoe departed for Shanghai at noon on the 5th. Before leaving, President Matsuoka of the South Manchuria Railway offered his respects.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Japanese Shanghai Daily News reports that, according to the Allied News Agency, Ambassador Kawagoe will soon go to Nanjing to begin diplomatic negotiations with the Chinese side regarding the North China Incident. However, according to news from official circles in this port, neither the Tokyo Foreign Ministry nor the ambassador himself has issued any notification. This is a misreport by the news agency. Given the current situation, the ambassador has no room for negotiation, so he is unlikely to go to Beijing immediately after arriving in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals Requesting to Join the War</h3>
<p>Japan’s Heinous Crimes Incite Public Anger; They Have Become the Enemy of Humanity</p>
<p>The Shen Zhou News Agency reports that since an English-language evening newspaper published the story of American Wales going to Baoding to help us resist the enemy, foreign nationals in this city have expressed their solidarity. According to an investigation by a reporter from the Continental News, many foreign nationals in this city (including British and American citizens) plan to ask our government to join the war effort. However, they currently feel they have no way to "enlist." It is said that many White Russians recently requested to join the army from the local authorities in this city. The authorities told them that they should contact Nanjing about this matter. The White Russians immediately sent a representative to Beijing. The outcome is unknown. Recently, an American who participated in the European war inquired about enlistment procedures with the Continental News.</p>

<h3>Editors Association and Others Telegraph Request for Swift Action</h3>
<p>Saying Preparations Will Be Too Late; Saying Peace is Impossible; Lawyers Association Telegraphs Request to Send Troops</p>
<p>The Shanghai Editors Association telegraphed the central government, saying, "To the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing, the National Government, Chairman Chiang, Vice Chairman Feng, Chairman Wang, Minister He, and the heads of all courts, ministries, and commissions, as well as all newspapers in the country: The enemy army has invaded and occupied our Pingjin, and our great rivers and mountains are shrinking by a hundred li every day. The national territory is limited, and there will be no day without national demise. We humbly implore the central government to make a decisive decision immediately, mobilize the whole country to rise up and resist the enemy, and save the nation from peril. If you say it is a local incident, the enemy has already mobilized the whole country; if you say we are preparing, preparations will be too late; if you say peace, how can we have peace without justice; if you say we should fight, we should do so quickly; if you say we will sacrifice, both we and the enemy will share the consequences. Rather than sitting and waiting for death, it is better to rise up and save ourselves. The enemy is deep, and the final moment has arrived. The enemy must not be allowed to grow, and time must not be lost. We wish to rise up and make a plan, and the people of the country are waiting in sorrow and anticipation. The Shanghai Editors Association kowtows."</p>
<p>Guo Qiming, Qian Ying, and other members of the Shanghai Lawyers Association proposed telegraphing to urge the central government to send troops to resist the enemy and to telegraph condolences to the families of Generals Tong and Zhao. The proposal was approved by the meeting. In addition to telegraphing condolences to the families of Generals Tong Lingge and Zhao Dengyu, members were appointed to draft a telegram requesting the central government to send troops to attack. The telegram has been drafted and will be stamped and sent by the standing committee members.</p>
<h3>Shunan Vessel Runs Aground in Storm</h3>
<p>Now that the typhoon has left Shanghai, all sea vessels delayed en route have arrived in Shanghai one after another yesterday, and those that could not leave the day before yesterday also left port yesterday in succession. Yesterday afternoon, this port received a telegram from Shantou stating that the Shunan vessel of the Haitong Shipping Company, with a tonnage of approximately 3,000 tons, encountered a typhoon during its voyage from Hong Kong to Shantou. After enduring all kinds of dangers, it was finally hit by large waves and ran aground on a reef off the coast of Shantou. The bottom of the ship was breached and water entered. The passengers and crew have now been rescued. Insurance companies here, because the vessel had not paid its premiums for a long time, had long lost the right to insure it and had canceled its policy. However, related Hakka people, upon hearing this news, have already telegraphed to inquire about the truth.</p>
<h3>Shanghai City Federation Telegraphs Condolences to Families of Zhao and Tong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens Federation telegraphed condolences to the families of Generals Zhao and Tong yesterday, saying, "To Commander Feng Zhi'an in Baoding, and to the respected families of General Zhao Dengyu and General Tong Lingge: When the enemy invaded Pingjin, the two generals loyally and bravely killed the enemy and sacrificed their lives for the country. The shocking news spread throughout the country and aroused grief and indignation. Please, dear family members, restrain your grief and adapt to the changes. We who survive will surely rise up and avenge the two generals and avenge the country. We hereby telegraph our condolences, with respectful regards. The Shanghai First Special District Citizens Federation."</p>
<h3>Qian Industry Clearing House Increases Discount on Collateral for Fellow Traders</h3>
<p>Government Bonds May Be Increased to 90%; Industrial and Commercial Loans Particularly Flexible</p>
<p>Since the deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations, Shanghai's industry and commerce have been significantly affected, especially the silver and money industry, which has become particularly cautious about providing loans to industry and commerce, stifling the financial path for industrial and commercial activities. Recently, the Qian Industry Association submitted the difficulties of the industrial and commercial sectors to fellow traders for discussion, considering increasing loans as a way to adjust. It has now been resolved that the Qian Industry Clearing House will specially increase the discount on collateral accepted from fellow traders. For example, government bonds will be increased from 70% to 90%, and title deeds will be increased from approximately 60% to 80%. Zhuang [traditional Chinese financial institutions] lacking funds can provide collateral at any time and receive assistance from the Clearing House in accordance with the standards. With this convenient accommodation, loans to industry and commerce can be particularly flexible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Nationals in Shanghai Begin Returning to Japan Today</h3>
<p>Those Carried by the Shanghai Maru: 400 Women, Children, the Elderly; Mountains of Luggage; All Bookings Before the 15th Are Full</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, Japanese nationals returning to Japan have mostly been those who withdrew from various ports up and down the Yangtze River and from Suzhou and Hangzhou to Shanghai, and then returned to Japan in batches by ship, totaling seven times. Japanese nationals from Chongqing and various parts of Sichuan will also arrive in Shanghai soon. Japanese nationals in Shanghai had not taken action to leave Shanghai until yesterday, when a tense situation suddenly emerged and they began to retreat and return to Japan one after another. The first batch of returnees were mostly women, children, and the elderly, who had obtained "repatriation certificates" from the consulate. The repatriation certificates stated that due to the current unstable situation, the residents were allowed to return to their home country. With this certificate, they could get a special discount when purchasing tickets from the shipping company. The first batch of Japanese nationals in this port flocked to the Nippon Yusen Kaisha to book tickets to Japan. The Shanghai Maru, which departed yesterday, had all its cabins booked by this batch of Japanese nationals. The ship could accommodate over 300 people, but the number of Japanese nationals who purchased tickets exceeded this number. The company had to find ways to temporarily increase the number of seats, so about 400 people returned to Japan on this ship. The amount of luggage, suitcases, and other items transported back to Japan was even greater. Yesterday, a large number of trucks dispatched by a Japanese-owned transportation company transported this large amount of luggage to the Huishan Wharf and transferred it to the ship. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai Maru was blocked by the wind and could not enter the port, and had to leave Shanghai today. All the transported suitcases and other items were temporarily returned to a certain place on Peng Road for storage, piled up like a mountain, and guarded by personnel sent by the Japanese transportation company. They will be loaded onto the ship at the wharf tomorrow. After this batch of Japanese nationals returns to their home country, there will be two, three, and four more batches leaving Shanghai. As of yesterday afternoon, Japanese nationals had already booked all the cabins on six Nippon Yusen Kaisha ships, totaling over 2,000 people. All Sino-Japanese liners of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha have been requisitioned by the Japanese government, so no ships can be dispatched to Shanghai. The Japanese nationals who are evacuating have no choice but to wait for the ship's schedule. Those who could not wait and were willing to forgo the special discount flocked to board British, American, and French liners back to Japan.</p>
<p>The Luoyang Arrives in Shanghai; Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the Luoyang Maru, also coming from the Yangtze River area, carried more than 120 Japanese nationals. There were Japanese nationals from Chongqing, Hankou, Shashi, Changsha, and other places. After landing, they stayed in Japanese hotels in Hongkou, planning to return to their home country on the Nagasaki Maru, which will depart from Shanghai on the 8th.</p>

<h3>Industrial Circles Discuss Wartime Production Control</h3>
<p>The General Labor Union Invites Four Factory Groups to Prepare for Long-Term Resistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union, in light of the enemy's burning desire to expand and seize the opportunity, and the national and ethnic groups already facing the final moment, in order to concentrate the strength of all Shanghai workers in the rear and contribute to the country, believes that industrial production must be strictly controlled during this extraordinary period. Following Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's declaration of "wartime as peacetime, peacetime as wartime," important production must not be interrupted or halted due to wartime. If the rear is not firmly prepared, it will affect the morale of the front, the rise and fall of the national destiny, and the survival of the ethnic group, all of which are closely related. However, this matter is significant and cannot be accomplished overnight. Therefore, a discussion will be held at 2:00 PM today, inviting the Shanghai City Federation, the China General Labor Union, the National Goods Factory Federation, the Machine-Made National Goods Factory Federation, and other groups to specifically discuss various measures for wartime industrial production control in this city, and to separately order both labor and capital to comply.</p>

<h3>All Sectors Eagerly Preparing for War of Resistance</h3>
<p>Spirits High in All Sectors; Considerable Clothes for Wounded Soldiers Collected</p>
<p>All sectors of the city have been busily preparing for emergency work in recent days, with a very tense mood. The various situations obtained yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>General Labor Union Fundraising for National Salvation</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union issued a notice to all industry unions in the city yesterday, saying, "This is to inform you that the Chinese nation is facing the final moment. The central authorities have declared their determination. Our frontline soldiers are loyally risking their lives. The ancestral graves and the fate of our descendants all depend on this. However, once the war begins, the supplies for the front will become increasingly numerous and complicated. Without adequate preparations, the war will be difficult to sustain, which is enough to fall into the enemy's trap of seeking a quick victory. In addition to uniting all sectors to prepare for various national salvation efforts, donating funds to save the country is especially urgent. This notice is to instruct your association to instruct all affiliated workers to contribute their wealth and economize, and to do their best to donate funds to save the country (donations should be sent directly to the banks, money shops, or newspapers designated by the Anti-Enemy Support Association). The war of resistance will not stop, and donations will not stop. The survival of the nation depends on this. The association has high hopes. This is to inform you."</p>
<p>Labor Circles National Salvation Association to be Established Tomorrow</p>
<p>In order to concentrate the strength of all workers in the city and unanimously participate in national salvation efforts, the City General Labor Union plans to organize the Labor Circles National Salvation Association and has appointed Zhou Xuexiang, Shao Xubai, Zhang Kechang, Ye Xianggao, Long Peiyun, and others to be responsible for preparations. It is learned that the association's charter and declaration have been drafted, and the founding meeting is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM tomorrow in the auditorium of the Minli Middle School in Dananmen, Nanshi. All unions have been notified to send two to five representatives with letters of introduction to participate.</p>
<p>Suggest Levying Entertainment Tax for National Salvation Donations</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens Federation sent a letter to the Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday, requesting that it immediately launch a patriotic donation by levying an entertainment and banquet tax to supplement national strength. The original letter stated, "We are writing to inform you that the national crisis is worsening day by day. Mobilizing the strength of the whole country and launching a full-scale war of resistance is the only way to save the country. Therefore, during this extraordinary period, everyone should practice frugality and save their surplus power for resisting the enemy. It has been decided by the fourth meeting of the standing committee of the association to suggest to your association that a national salvation donation be levied on all hotels, restaurants, theaters, and dance halls from today onwards to supplement national defense," as recorded in the minutes. We are sending the letter accordingly, requesting that you promptly handle the matter to benefit the national salvation effort. We look forward to your response.</p>
<p>Clothes for Wounded Soldiers Collected in Considerable Numbers</p>
<p>Since the frontline Red Cross sent a letter to the rear groups requesting clothes for wounded soldiers, all sectors have been collecting them separately. The hardware industry, through the trade association, has made thousands of sets, and has hired workers to make them, which will be sent to the Red Cross for use on the front. Women's groups have made more than 2,000 sets, which have been delivered to the Red Cross, and are still being made continuously. The garment-making movement will be expanded, and the Joint Committee of Women's Groups will launch a campaign to promote self-made clothing to save labor.</p>
<h3>Surge in Passengers at Shanghai North Station Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sudden Crowding After 6:00 PM; Extra Third and Fourth Class Passenger Trains Added</p>
<p>Since the North China Incident occurred, Japanese nationals living in various parts of China have been returning to their home country one after another, and Japanese-owned factories in Shanghai have also closed down or reorganized, resulting in the unemployment of many Chinese workers, both male and female, who relied on handicrafts for a living. However, it is difficult to live in Shanghai, so they mostly returned to their hometowns, causing the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway to be crowded the day before yesterday. Extra trains were added that evening to relieve passenger traffic. However, yesterday afternoon, after 6:00 PM, third and fourth-class passengers continued to arrive at the station, totaling no less than 10,000 people. Men, women, old and young, carried suitcases and rushed to buy tickets and board the train. The order was somewhat chaotic at the time. Railway police rushed to maintain order and the traffic department arranged for trains, adding three temporary third and fourth-class passenger trains to Wuxi and Zhenjiang at 9:00 PM, 11:15 PM, and 1:30 AM this morning to get through the crisis. At the same time, it was learned that passengers coming to Shanghai from the Kunshan to Nanxiang area were also extremely crowded, so a temporary downstream passenger train was specially added at 11:30 PM last night, which is expected to arrive at the North Station at around 7:50 AM this morning. It is said that luggage is piled up at the stations between Nanxiang and Kunshan, almost like mountains.</p>
<h3>Delay in Shanghai-Beiping Train</h3>
<p>Through-Train Departed on Time Last Night</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Beiping through-train that departed from Jinan to Shanghai the day before yesterday was delayed by nine hours due to crowded passengers and luggage, and arrived at the North Station at 5:15 PM yesterday. The upstream Shanghai-Beiping through-train from Shanghai to Jinan last night still departed from the North Station on time at 12:00 midnight last night.</p>
<h3>Who's Who</h3>
<p>Wang Maogong, Liu Ruiheng, and Lin Baisheng took the night train to Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>City Party Headquarters Changes Broadcast News Time</h3>
<p>From 4:15 PM, Report at the Ministry of Communications Radio Station</p>
<p>Our city's party headquarters, in light of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, which has garnered national attention, and to allow the general public to hear the news as soon as possible, had arranged for Zhang Hanyun to report daily from 4:00 PM to 4:20 PM at the Sino-Western Radio Station on the day's telegrams from various locations and local news. At the same time, other radio stations were asked to rebroadcast to ensure wide coverage. However, at that time, all radio stations had advertising segments, making rebroadcasting difficult. Therefore, the time has been changed to begin at 4:15 PM and end at 4:30 PM, and to facilitate rebroadcasting, the report will be broadcast at the Ministry of Communications Radio Station. Listeners are asked to take note.</p>
<h3>Statement Prohibiting Police Officers from Entering the Chinese Territory of the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Due to the Implementation of Martial Law in the Chinese Territory, Concerns Arise that Roaming Officers Might Be Detained</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that rumors circulating outside claim that the Municipal Council has issued a formal order prohibiting police officers from entering the Chinese territory. This is a misunderstanding. It should be clarified that the Municipal Council has not issued such an order. The origin of this rumor likely stems from the fact that several areas under the jurisdiction of Chinese personnel in Shanghai have now implemented martial law. Foreigners traveling to places like Zhenru and Wusong and staying until after dark risk being detained by Chinese police in accordance with martial law regulations until dawn the next day. Given the current tense atmosphere in Shanghai, the police force should strive not to weaken its strength in any way. Therefore, officers and police officers should not be placed in a situation where they might be delayed in reporting for duty if ordered. As such, the Chief Inspector, out of duty, has warned them that the Chinese territory has implemented martial law, and police officers should not frequent various parts of the Chinese territory during off-duty hours to avoid being detained and unable to report immediately when ordered. As for there being no such inconveniences within the Chinese territory, those who wish to go are free to do so, and their movements are not restricted.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Held Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Obstructions in the Alley Entrance on Xiaoshadu Road Removed</h3>
<p>Owner of No. 15 in the Alley Pays Overdue Land Tax, Obstruction Immediately Removed, Same Incident Occurred on Meizhou Road</p>
<p>Yesterday's local news in the North-China Daily News reported that the Municipal Council's Bubbling Well Road Police, late the night before, led twenty road workers from the Public Works Department and several Chinese police officers to Xiaoshadu Road, completely blocking Alley 427, with all actions similar to the blocking of Yu Gu Village on Yuyuan Road on March 11 of this year. After an investigation by this reporter to the relevant parties, it was learned that the report was at odds with the facts. That evening, when the Municipal Council notified the Bubbling Well Road Police to carry out the order, they did not completely block Alley 427, but only blocked the front and back entrances of House No. 15 at the northern end of the alley with wire mesh and wooden stakes. Upon investigation, the houses at No. 15 are owned by the Yao family, and were once rented to the Xinfuji Construction Factory. After the factory moved out in June of this year, it was leased to the Ruichang Factory. However, the owner of the house's land had never registered with the British Consulate, so they had never paid land tax. According to the current regulations of the Municipal Council, whether registered or not, all land within the concession should be taxed. The Yao family owner had always ignored this, which led to the incident the night before. The total unpaid taxes amounted to over 400 yuan. Until yesterday morning, when the employees of the Ruichang Factory suddenly found their access blocked, they urgently notified the owner. However, the Yao family owner is currently in poor circumstances. After mutual consultation, the Ruichang Factory negotiated with the Municipal Council and paid the overdue land tax on behalf of the owner. The Municipal Council then removed the obstructions at around 1 PM, restoring the original state. In total, the alley was blocked for more than ten hours. At the same time, it was learned that the property at No. 300 Meizhou Road was also blocked by officers from the Yulin Road Police the night before due to the same issue of unpaid taxes. It was also the case that the owner paid the taxes yesterday and the obstructions were removed, restoring traffic. Afterwards, Municipal Council Director General Fessenden stated that this incident was not a problem of patrol fees. The residents in the neighborhood had paid their taxes without any delay. The dispute was a land tax registration issue. All land within the concession has been registered with the various foreign consulates, and land deeds have been obtained. The Municipal Council then collects land taxes from the land with foreign deeds. Currently, most of the land within the concession has been registered with the various foreign consulates, but a small portion still holds Chinese deeds and refuses to pay taxes. Before September, the Municipal Council considered this situation unfair and decided to collect land taxes from landowners with Chinese deeds to show fairness. Over the past nine months, some Chinese deed properties have paid the land tax, but there are still those who refuse to pay. The Municipal Council believes that since everyone residing in the concession enjoys equal rights, there is no reason to refuse payment, and therefore took decisive action.</p>
<h3>Fu Wenhao's Home Repeatedly Robbed</h3>
<p>Robbery Planned Under the Guise of Renting a House, Yesterday Escorted to the First Court for Trial</p>
<p>Cantonese man Lin Chuanyao was arrested by the French Concession police and escorted to the Second Special Court due to his alleged involvement in the robbery of the home of the famous socialite Ms. Ai'ai Chuan Wenhao. Although Lin absolutely denied it, saying that he was with Bai Wenwei of the Central Committee at the time, the court sentenced him to five years in prison. He is currently appealing to the Third High Court. However, after investigation by Chinese Detectives Tang Ziwu and Liang Yuliang of the Jing'an Temple Police of the Public Concession, it was discovered that Lin had also committed robbery in the Public Concession. He was brought back from the Third High Court yesterday and escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Lin was accused of robbing the home of Zhang Beiping at No. 4, Lane C, Daxilu, of jewelry and other items worth approximately 938 yuan on the afternoon of September 15 last year, violating Article 330 of the Criminal Law. Judge Chuan Lin presided over the interrogation. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, stated that the plaintiff, Zhang Beiping, had spare rooms, so he posted a notice for rent. On September 11, a person came to see the rooms, and came again on the 12th and 13th. On the 14th, he paid a deposit of three yuan, and on the 15th, the robbery occurred. Zhang Beiping and his wife Zhang Sun have identified the person who came to see the rooms as the defendant Lin Chuanyao. Furthermore, it was found that a fingerprint was left at the scene of the robbery at No. 34, Lane 1273, Yuyuan Road on October 26 last year. After comparison, the fingerprint matches the defendant's fingerprint. Therefore, a request is made to reschedule the trial. When the defendant went to Zhang Beiping's house to rent the rooms, he claimed to be working in the Fujian Provincial Government. Then, Zhang Beiping and his wife testified and confirmed that the defendant was present at both the viewing of the rooms and the robbery. When questioned, Lin Chuanyao confessed, "I really have a lot of grievances that I cannot express. Now, I cannot but admit it. I only ask the court to conclude the case quickly and please be lenient in sentencing, so that I may have a chance to reform." Judge Chuan verified the confession and ordered him remanded in custody for a week for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Gruesome Murder of a Male Corpse Found in an Attic Room</h3>
<p>Genitals Removed, Cause Under Investigation</p>
<p>A Cheng surname man came to rent the attic room of the Tang family residence at No. 11, Rongkang Lane, No. 34 Chengdu Road (a one-story building) a month ago. At that time, the Tang family negotiated with him and asked him what his occupation was and whether he had any family. The man said, "I work in insurance and my wife is currently in the countryside. She will come to live with me in three to five days." After agreeing on the rent, he moved into the attic room. The furniture in the room was all high-quality wooden furniture. Usually, the Tang family lived downstairs and did not pay much attention to the tenant's activities. Yesterday afternoon around 4 PM, the Tang family went upstairs for something and passed by the attic room door. Suddenly, they smelled a strange stench coming from the crack in the door, which was very strange. They immediately knocked on the door, but there was no response. They then tried to pry open the attic room door and saw a male corpse, naked and covered in knife wounds. The genitals were completely cut off. The Tang family immediately reported to the Chengdu Road Police. Upon receiving the report, the police chief immediately dispatched detectives to investigate. The corpse was then sent to the mortuary for examination. The cause of death is under investigation by the police. It is rumored that it may be a case of rape and murder.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Zhu Family Kidnapping Case Resolved, Large Number of Kidnappers Apprehended</h3>
<p>Two Police Stations Capture Fourteen Male and Female Bandits, Main Criminal Hiding in Suzhou, Emergency Action Taken</p>
<p>Around 2 PM yesterday afternoon, the Hongkou Police Department received a tip that a Suzhou villager surnamed Zhu was robbed by more than ten bandits outside Fengmen, Suzhou, two weeks ago, and that Zhu's six-year-old child was kidnapped. The perpetrators are hiding in the flat houses in Zhangjiazhai, Maitehesi Road, Public Concession. The Police Department immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the address.</p>
<p>They arrested on the spot twelve people: Li Asi, 31, from Suzhou; Pu Asan, 38; Ma Asi, 31; Gao Xiangsheng, 32; Wang Jinbao, 34; Gao Amao, 25; Chen Ahai, 30; Zhu Arong, 50, from Kunshan; Dai Xiaodi, 40; Jin Genrong, 37; Chen Weigao, 32, from Haimen; Zhou Xiaoyue, 49, from Ningbo. The house was empty. After interrogation, the suspects confessed that two other accomplices, one male and one female, were hiding at No. 76 Maiqi Lane, Maiqi Road, French Concession. The police detectives immediately joined forces with French Concession detectives to arrest them. The bandits were caught off guard and arrested on the spot without resistance.</p>
<p>The hostage, a six-year-old boy surnamed Zhu, was rescued and taken back to Hongkou together. The two male and female bandits confessed that the male bandit was Jiang Genrong, 28, from Suzhou, and the female bandit was Zhu Caiying, 21, from Changshu, who was responsible for guarding the hostage. They also confessed that the mastermind of the case is still hiding in Suzhou and that all three firearms used during the robbery were hidden in the mastermind's house. After obtaining the confession, the police believed that it was necessary to pursue the mastermind and temporarily detained all the suspects. They will be sent to the court for investigation this morning. A document has been sent to the Suzhou police to take emergency action.</p>

<h3>Wang Xinggao Still Missing, Guarantor Held Responsible, Deadline to Surrender</h3>
<p>Further Delay Will Result in Transfer to the Prosecutor's Office for Investigation, Bail of 20,000 Yuan Has Been Forfeited</p>
<p>Wang Xinggao, a native of Funing, was previously arrested for inciting the assassination of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World. He was sentenced to life imprisonment by the Special Court. He appealed to the Third High Court, which declared him not guilty. During the appeal period, he was released on bail of 20,000 yuan with a store guarantee. The Legal Police Department, dissatisfied, petitioned the prosecutor of the Third High Court to appeal to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court then overturned the Third High Court's acquittal and remanded the case to the Third High Court for a new trial. Wang fled upon hearing the news, and the Third High Court was unable to summon him. The court then ordered the seven guarantors of Wang to surrender the 20,000 yuan bail and gave them a deadline to find and surrender Wang to the court. This has been reported in this newspaper. Later, the guarantors collected the full amount of their respective guarantees and submitted them to the court. They were still given a deadline to surrender Wang Xinggao to the court. Yesterday morning, Wu Tingqi, the presiding judge of the criminal court of the Third High Court, along with assessors Chen Daqi and Wang Yue, presided over the Third Criminal Court. They summoned Huang Shijie, Chen Guojun, and the other seven guarantors of Wang Xinggao to court. They asked when they could find and surrender Wang Xinggao to the court. None of the guarantors could give a definite answer. The court then ordered that the 20,000 yuan bail submitted to the court be forfeited. They also gave the guarantors two weeks to quickly find and surrender Wang Xinggao to the court. If the guarantors delayed further, at the next court session, the guarantors would be transferred to the prosecutor's office for investigation of the crime of facilitating escape. Upon hearing the order, the guarantors left with a disgruntled look.</p>
<h3>American Who Benefited Rickshaw Pullers Passes Away</h3>
<p>Expressions of Grief from All Sides</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Mr. Madsen, the founder of the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Relief Association, passed away peacefully at Hong'en Hospital on Tuesday night of this week due to old age. Mr. Madsen, a Scotsman, served in the Public Concession Police during his prime and was promoted to inspector due to his meritorious service. He retired in 1911 due to illness. After two years, he returned to Shanghai and established a textile business in the city. Seeing that rickshaw pullers toiled all day long and could barely make a living, and that no one would help them when they encountered illness and poverty, he had a compassionate heart and founded the Rickshaw Pullers Relief Association. The initial scale was small, but now it has been sponsored by various charitable organizations in Shanghai, and the association's work is very developed. The association is located in Zhabei, and every night hundreds of rickshaw pullers gather at the meeting place to listen to the gospel and the latest traffic rules issued by the Municipal Council. This is very important for illiterate coolies. Mr. Madsen was the central figure in the association. His business was located on Renji Road, and the employees in the store had to manage the association's affairs in their spare time. Therefore, the accountant of the store was also the accountant of the association, and the salesman of the store was also the evangelist of the association. The North-China Daily News was the first to realize that Mr. Madsen's work was very beneficial to society, so it often solicited donations from readers during Christmas to help the association for many years. Fortunately, there were many generous people in Shanghai who donated money, which reduced the hardship of the extremely poor laborers in society who had previously been ignored. At the beginning of the association's establishment, it relied on Mr. Madsen's business profits to maintain it because there was no funding. After 23 years of hard work, the Salvation Army took over two years ago, and the late philanthropist Mr. Leser donated some funds, which are now managed by the management committee to benefit the association and the Salvation Army. Although the association's work will continue as usual in the future, Mr. Madsen's death is a great loss to the association. Although he has not been very involved in the administration of the association in recent years, the influence he personally wielded cannot be matched by others. The Deputy Chief Inspector of the Municipal Council Police Department expressed regret over his death yesterday. It is heard that when the funeral is held today, the Deputy Chief Inspector, other senior police officers, and a team of police officers from the Gordon Road Police Training School will attend.</p>
<h3>Civil Martial Arts Association Intensifies Martial Arts Training</h3>
<p>Martial arts can both defend oneself and kill enemies, and the Chinese people have always valued them. Zhang Bingwen, the president of the Shanghai Civil Martial Arts Research Association, has served in the military for many years and is skilled in martial arts. He has a lot of unique experience in swordsmanship, so those who seek to learn from him compete with each other. There are currently over a thousand members, all of whom have their own occupations. Those without a stable occupation are not allowed to join. Seeing that foreign aggression is becoming more and more urgent, Mr. Zhang gathered the original members and intensified training. Yesterday, all the members performed various martial arts to welcome visitors such as Xiang Haiqian, a prominent figure from the military and naval circles. The performers were all brave and strong, and could be used for the country in case of emergency.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council's Housing Committee Stipulates Nine Construction Measures</h3>
<p>Mezzanine Construction Sets Appropriate Limits</p>
<p>The report of the Public Concession Municipal Council's Investigation Committee on Housing Conditions previously established a subcommittee composed of Xi Yushu, Jiang Yiping, and others for research. The subcommittee has decided to allow the existence of Chinese-style house mezzanines and construction issues within the concession to the extent possible. It is now known that the subcommittee's research has resulted in nine types of illegal alterations, which should be handled according to the following methods: (1) Structures on sun decks and residences can be issued permits to be built, but the walls must be made of non-combustible materials, the roof must be coated with asphalt, the interior height must not exceed eight feet, and handrails must be installed on both sides of the stairs. (2) The walls of structures on top of shops must be five feet inward from the shop. The door at the top of the stairs must lead directly to the open air. (3) Awnings can be approved to be built, but there must be light and air. If built in a back patio with stairs, it must pass over one floor. (4) Mezzanines can be issued permits to be built. The distance from the mezzanine to the floor must be at least eight feet, and the bottom floor must be at least seven feet. (5) Structures and doors on the sidewalks in the alley can be issued permits to be built, but the minimum width of the designated sidewalk must be maintained. (6) Balconies are not allowed to be converted into rooms. If they have been converted, they should be restored immediately. (7) Stairs are allowed to be built in the back patio to prevent fire. (8) Hollow ceilings are prohibited. (9) Wooden sun decks on the roof can still be built, but there must be safety equipment.</p>
<h3>US Customs Strictly Prevents Smuggling of Narcotics</h3>
<p>Strict Inspection of Incoming Sailors</p>
<p>According to the American Air Express, the US Customs, in conjunction with the US Coast Guard, has recently strictly prohibited the Great American Lines and the American Mail Line from carrying various narcotics from the Far East. When each ship enters, it is followed and monitored by a coastal guard patrol boat. Packages are not allowed to be dropped into the sea, and when the ship docks, there are members of the guard regiment in uniform standing guard on the pier and on the ship's gangway. Each time crew members and cargo handlers leave the ship, they must be thoroughly searched by the guard regiment members. The US government hopes that this will prevent crew members from smuggling narcotics ashore. American customs officers also pay close attention to searching various luggage, paying particular attention to the structure of the trunks, fearing that there may be hidden compartments for smuggling. Recently, customs has found several cases of carrying red pills and morphine.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit "Beauty" Brand Popsicles Subject to Court Judgment</h3>
<p>Recently, Wang Ruiwen, the manager of the New China Popsicle Company at No. 3, Nian San Road, Mintini Yin Road, counterfeited the "Beauty" brand popsicles of the Bingge Lian Company. It is heard that the company has found out and, fearing that eating this may cause dangerous diseases and damage the reputation of the company, it has filed a lawsuit in the Shanghai Second District Court. A judgment has been made on August 2, ordering that the company will no longer use the counterfeit popsicle packaging paper in the future.</p>

<h3>Young Man and Woman Attempt Suicide by Poisoning, Rescued</h3>
<p>Lu Jiaxiang Has Been Sentenced to Two Years, The Woman's Father Still Infuriated, Sues Again</p>
<p>Lu Xianggen, a native of Ningbo with the house number 33 Qiu'an Lane, Chang'an Road, Zhabei, works as a salesman in a camel down factory. He has a daughter named Beilei, 16 years old, who studies in elementary school. She has blossomed, and there is a young man named Lu Jiaxiang, 21 years old, from Jiangyin, who is passionately pursuing her. He and Beilei have fallen in love and secretly pledged their lives to each other, seeking her father's consent. However, he did not allow it. So, the couple eloped to Nanjing on June 14. Because</p>
<p>They ran out of money, they returned to Shanghai on June 24 and stayed at a hotel near the North Station. They bought two taels of opium with the remaining seven yuan in legal tender, and wrote "Determined to Commit Suicide" in blood on their undershirts, along with a letter notifying the woman's father. Then, they divided the opium into five qian portions and told Beilei to swallow it. He then mixed the remaining one tael and five qian with beer and drank it. Unexpectedly, he immediately vomited, allowing him to survive. After being sent to the hospital, they both recovered their health. Zhang Xianggen learned of this and arrested Lu Jiaxiang and sent him to the district court. The prosecutor first charged him with enticement, and he has already been sentenced to two years of imprisonment. But Zhang Xianggen hates Lu to the bone and sued Lu Jiaxiang again in the district court for aiding suicide. Judge Chen Kangsun opened the trial yesterday. The judge asked Lu Jiaxiang, "Why did you buy opium to commit suicide after going to Nanjing and returning?" He replied, "She committed suicide herself. The opium I bought for seven yuan was my money. In the hotel, she swallowed about five qian, and the rest I ate. I wrote a letter to her parents saying that we</p>
<p>Had already committed suicide, telling them to come and collect the bodies." The judge said, "You said in your letter to ask them to save you. Were you pretending, otherwise, wouldn't you have died if you ate so much opium?" He replied, "The tea boy sent us to the hospital the next day." At this point, the judge asked Zhang Beilei to testify. "At that time, he took a lump of opium as big as a bayberry and told me to eat it. He forced me to drink it down with beer. He had told me to commit suicide when I went to Nanjing with him. I didn't want to return to Shanghai. Later,</p>
<p>We went to buy opium together in the hotel." At this point, Zhang Huanwen, the tea boy from the North Station Hotel, testified. Then, Zhang Xianggen testified that the defendant's suicide was premeditated, and presented letters and other items. The judge said, "You are suing him for suicide, your daughter will also be prosecuted. What do you think?" He replied, "Now that the country is in trouble, my daughter has joined the rescue team. Can she be given a suspended sentence?" The judge said, "This cannot be determined by you, there will be a legal judgment." He then announced the end of the debate, and the verdict will be announced on the 11th of this month.</p>

<h3>The Lower-Level Strength We Should Pay Attention to Amidst the Unified National Resistance Against Japan</h3>
<p>— Bao Lu</p>
<p>Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident occurred and escalated, anyone with a conscience is filled with indignation and rises up in resistance. The logic is extremely simple: the enemy is advancing step by step, and we are retreating step by step. If we continue to retreat, we will only surrender to the enemy. Therefore, to seek survival in the face of death, is there any other option?</p>
<p>This incident has not only brought our compatriots to the point of no tolerance, but also righteous people all over the world feel the same way. In addition to verbal and written condemnation, more than 300 pilots in Los Angeles, USA, have requested to join the Chinese Air Force for combat. The American righteous man Xiao De from the “January 28th Incident” is the best precedent.</p>
<p>As for our own compatriots, since they have made up their minds and are prepared to sacrifice everything, they naturally don't care about anything else. According to a report on the fourth day, “Chinese employees of Japanese banks in Shanghai, including Korean, Taiwanese, Zhengjin, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and various shipping companies, as well as major yarn factories, have been actively resigning since July 8th. As of today, there are already more than 260 people, most of whom are management-level personnel. Six out of ten have already left. Only a few compradors are still hesitating because they are reluctant to part with high salaries.”</p>
<p>More than 260 people is not a large number, but "most of them are management-level personnel," and "six out of ten" of them have already resigned. Therefore, the impact on the work is probably already considerable. As for the "comprador class" who are "reluctant to part with high salaries," they will probably only cry when they see the coffin. As for the other workers who live from day to day, because they have no food to last overnight, we really can't deeply blame them. Among the awakened workers, they are probably overwhelmed with pain. If they had a minimum means of livelihood, I believe they would not only "resign one after another" like the management-level personnel, but would also immediately become the backbone of the national salvation and resistance against Japan, because the oppression and pain they have suffered are enough to make them understand the true face of Japanese imperialism.</p>
<p>Similar to the workers, we should also express our views on the management-level personnel of various Japanese commercial firms who have resigned. Firstly, China can only save itself from danger by uniting all the people. Our fates are the same. We cannot ignore them simply because it is the national duty not to serve the Japanese, because they are members of our community. Secondly, like the workers, the management-level personnel have personally experienced the various oppressions of the Japanese. Their enthusiasm for national salvation and resistance against Japan must be very high, and their will must be very strong. In order to increase the strength of the resistance, we cannot abandon them and let them fight on their own.</p>
<p>We should abandon our individual interests under the overall goal, take the interests of the nation as the premise, assist them and organize them, so that they can live with the general public and become members of the iron collective.</p>
<p>As for the other management-level personnel who have not yet resigned, and the workers who are still swallowing their anger and bowing their heads for the sake of survival, we must also consider them and make them our iron warriors.</p>
<p>We know that many conscienceless things are caused by life. Then why should we let these many ambitious people be at a loss and unable to contribute, or be forced to become unwilling traitors!</p>
<h3>Storm</h3>
<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>A large black ball, high up, hung on the top of the Jianghai Customs signal tower. This is an alert, an alert for a violent storm! That black ball, heavy, seemed to press on everyone's heart, causing suffocation and depression. Everyone's future seemed to harbor an unpredictable crisis, a misfortune. An extraordinary encounter was approaching, about to descend upon everyone without discrimination. The calm Huangpu River stirred up waves, frequently crashing against the banks, spray splashing ashore, wetting people's shoes. All shipping routes were announced to be suspended, and travelers reluctantly carried their luggage, despondently turning back. The sampans that usually drifted back and forth had already taken shelter. Only a few giant ships and gunboats were slightly smoking from their smokestacks, and the flags on the masts were fluttering like torn silk. In the moment before the storm was about to strike, it was lonely, lonely.</p>
<p>I sat quietly in my lonely small house, becoming an expectant of a bad fate. I worried, worried that the small house I lived in was too old and could not withstand the violent storm, endangering my life. I also regretted, regretting my repeated procrastination. Why didn't I prepare for a rainy day and repair the house? I had planned to do so several times, but each time I lacked the determination to realize it. Sure enough, now it was a crisis to make the old and dilapidated walls and beams resist the violent invasion of wind and rain! However, worry and regret were in vain. Even hammering a stake or nailing a sheet of lead was too late. From my cowardly heart arose a vague hope, hoping that the hurricane could change direction midway, that the heavy rain would disappear without a trace, and that everything would turn from danger to safety. In this way, in empty hope, I let every minute and second pass.</p>
<p>However, the prologue of the storm finally unfolded outside the house. When I woke up from my daytime dream, the windows and doors of the small house were rattling in the wind. Pea-sized raindrops beat against the glass on the window panes, like drumming. On the roof, the gale roared like tigers and lions, agitating the bowstrings of the crisscrossing power lines, making a "woo woo" sound. The entire house was shaking, and plaster was falling from the cracks in the tiles with a "sighing" sound. I worried that the house would collapse at any moment. If I closed my eyes for a moment, it was as if I were on the top of a peak, unable to stand firm, like a lonely boat</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>tossed on the vast sea, about to be swept away by huge waves. Wanting to summon all my strength to call for help, I lost my autonomy, lost my reason, and surrendered my entire life to fate.</p>
<p>Apart from the sound of the wind "whooshing" and the sound of the rain "splashing," I could hear no other sound. On the large elm tree nearby, no more cicada chirping could be heard, and sparrows did not fly to the eaves. Even the mountain insects in the bamboo cage hanging on the rafters did not want to spread their wings and sing. No matter how turbulent and fierce the howling of the storm was, a world without the chirping of living things was ultimately desolate, lonely. 'Clang!' I was shocked, my heart pounding. I suspected that a thug had shot at me, but I was not injured. I suddenly realized my foolishness. Where were the thugs! It was the gale that had shattered the glass on the window pane. Rain immediately swept in, following the wind, and the house was wet. Books and newspapers were blown all over the floor, the mosquito net was spinning, and the electric light was swaying in the air. I was stimulated by the cold, and I suffered a major disruption and loss. This was external!</p>
<p>I hurriedly used glue and paper to paste up the punctured window pane, hoping that the wind and rain would no longer invade, but it was no help in reality. The thin paper could no longer resist the full force of the storm. Leaks also started to appear from the cracks in the roof tiles. The bedding, writing desk, and chests were all soaked with rainwater, and even the place to stand was a problem. The wind was still howling, and the rain was still pouring down. However, in an extremely dangerous environment and an extremely cowardly state of mind, great courage can suddenly burst forth. I simply put on my raincoat, put on my rain hat, rolled up my bedding, and stuffed the books, newspapers, and chests under the bed. I also found planks, nails, oilcloth, and a hammer. I prepared to climb onto the roof at risk, walk out the door, climb under the eaves, and begin my entire work of resisting the storm. I no longer passively endure the attack, I no longer surrender my life to fate, and I no longer seek a warm and comfortable dream. No matter how violent the wind and rain are, I will fight with all my strength!</p>
<h3>We Are Forging Big Swords</h3>
<p>— Ye Ge</p>
<p>——Report One</p>
<p>I went to the street to find a blacksmith to repair a few things.</p>
<p>The old, wide, and unclean street unfolded in the August sunlight. The cobblestone road was steaming with heat and the stench of people's sweat. The blacksmiths were scattered on both sides of the street, living in their dark and filthy huts. The bellows panted, and the furnace spat out cyan-red flames, surging upwards, as if it wanted to use its blood-red tongue to lick the air. Standing in front of the anvil were three coal-black people, an old master and his young apprentice. They stretched out their bare arms as much as possible, dragged the sledgehammer, and banged on an ordinary and ugly iron bar. The iron strip was heated red-hot, splashing with red sparks, slowly widening and lengthening its body, and being forged into the model of a big sword.</p>
<p>The sound of iron being hammered flew out from the blacksmith's dirty hut, mixed together, filling the ancient street, majestic and rhythmic. I followed this rhythm, stepping forward.</p>
<p>I stopped at the door of the first shop and explained my intentions. The old master stopped the work in his hands, frowned impatiently, and listened calmly to my words. Then, he shook his head and hammered the iron with his hand again.</p>
<p>"No time!" he said.</p>
<p>The young and sturdy apprentice wiped the sweat from his face with his dirty black fingers, spat saliva in his palm, picked up the hammer, and repeated the same tone as his master, banging on the anvil again.</p>
<p>"Why don't you have time?" I was annoyed, the sound of iron being hammered made me feel dizzy.</p>
<p>"Why?" The old blacksmith was silent. When he put the cold iron bar back on the furnace, he arrogantly raised his head and glanced at me with annoyance. "We are forging big swords!"</p>
<p>Slowly, he waved his hand, and I walked away.</p>
<p>At the second shop, I stood at their dirty doorway in the same way, made the same request to them, and explained that I was willing to pay a higher price than usual.</p>
<p>"No!" They replied to me like this. "We can't, we are forging big swords!"</p>
<p>Then they pointed to me, and there, in the dark corner of the house, were a dozen cutlers crowded together with the big swords they had forged. I left and went to the third shop.</p>
<p>By this time, my heart was completely shrouded in curiosity. I did not make my request, but simply expressed my doubts:</p>
<p>"Good friends, what are you doing with so many big swords?"</p>
<p>"What are we doing?" They began to be encouraged and excited. "Give it to the brothers on the front line to kill the enemy!" The tone was full of so much conviction and enthusiasm, I was moved.</p>
<p>An old man, wiping the smoke ash on his chest with his patched jacket, walked straight to me from the shop.</p>
<p>"Young friend, do you need us to do something for you?"</p>
<p>I nodded and explained my intentions. He smiled and gently stroked his pale beard.</p>
<p>"You are late, we are all forging big swords."</p>
<p>"A whole street?" I was surprised.</p>
<p>"Yes, a whole street. The day before yesterday, we forged three thousand, and in the future we will continue to forge until there is not a single enemy in our country..."</p>
<p>I didn't have the courage to go on. The weather was very clear, and the sun was smiling.</p>
<p>I walked towards the way home, behind me was a sound of iron banging, like a grand chorus, flying out from every filthy blacksmith's hut, converging and circling in the air.</p>
<p>"We are forging big swords!" the steel chorus shouted.</p>
<p>"We are forging big swords!" I repeated, unable to stop smiling.</p>
<h3>Forest</h3>
<p>— Chang Ji</p>
<p>From morning to night, in that shady and lush forest at Old Crow Tip, there was the sound of knives and axes ringing, "ding ding" "dong dong"! Then there was "shala"! "Shala...la"! One by one, the big trees fell down at the roots! This sound shook the valley and trembled the hearts of every farmer under this hillside.</p>
<p>When the news that the short-legged men were coming to cut down the trees was brought to this group of honest farmers, how frightened they were! Everyone knew that the forest at Old Crow Tip had been painstakingly managed by their ancestors for their children and grandchildren. Even the smallest tree had a history of decades. How important they considered this forest to be! Not only was it the source of their livelihood, but it also guaranteed the feng shui of their village. Usually, no one dared to move a branch or a leaf without permission. Fighting and bloodshed often occurred because people from other villages came to steal their trees. In their simple minds, there was only this one unchanging conservative idea! The father should pass this mountain forest to his son, and then let the son pass it on to his son. They guarded this source of livelihood from generation to generation. At the same time, they would not allow others to destroy the feng shui that connected the rise and fall of their village. This was their responsibility and also the village law that they did not violate the ancestral teachings.</p>
<p>But no one could have imagined that now this group of strong and unreasonable short-legged men came and started to work on their own without saying a word to take over the clearing of this mountain forest. This was really a rare thing that had never been seen before. Naturally, the village chief had to come forward and reason with them, but that was useless: you reason, and he cuts down trees.</p>
<p>So the village chief stammered:</p>
<p>"If you cut down our forest, it's like taking our lives."</p>
<p>"Just take your lives! What dare you do?"</p>
<p>The village chief's face turned blue with anger, and he couldn't say a word.</p>
<p>"Humph"!</p>
<p>That man still hid his pistol in his pocket, watching over this group of honest farmers without weapons with great satisfaction.</p>
<p>"Ding ding"! "Dong dong"! ...... Old Crow Tip was filled with such a noisy sound of knives and axes all day long: "Shala" "Shala...la"! Big trees, small trees; all fell down one after another, and then rolled from the mountain to the bottom of the mountain.</p>
<p>Now Old Crow Tip is bare and has lost that shady and lush forest, leaving only some traces of the knives and axes.</p>
<p>"Oh! The world has changed. They still talk about the so-called kingly way and paradise, but even this forest that has been preserved for hundreds of years has suffered a calamity"!</p>
<p>Some people are still lamenting in pain even now!</p>
<h3>Defending the Marco Polo Bridge</h3>
<p>The Marco Polo Bridge is located southwest of Beiping, 15 kilometers from Qianmen, and belongs to Wanping County. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, Beiping was designated as a special municipality, and the Wanping County government was moved here. The stone bridge originated in the Jin Dynasty. The History of the Jin Dynasty River Channels states that the stone bridge was built in the 27th year of Dading (i.e., the 14th year of Chunxi of Emperor Xiaozong of the Song Dynasty, 1187 AD) and completed in the 3rd year of Mingchang (i.e., the first year of Shaoxi of Emperor Guangzong of the Song Dynasty, 1190 AD), and was given the name Guangli. The bridge is located on the north-south transportation route, with a constant stream of travelers. Marco Polo's travels praised the grandeur of this bridge, which could accommodate ten riders side by side. Because of water overflowing and the bridge collapsing, it was repeatedly repaired in the Ming and Qing dynasties. Because it was close to Yanjing, a city was set up for defense. The stone bridge is 66 feet long and has 11 arches.</p>

In this period of "constant loss of land," it is even more noteworthy. The magazine strives for progress. Recently, Zuo Ming specially wrote a one-act play with the Marco Polo Bridge Incident as the background, full of enthusiastic emotions of resisting Japan and saving the country. It will be published in the fourth issue of "Art and Literature Line," which has now been sent to print and will be published soon. Each issue of the magazine sells for one dime and is available at major bookstores.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Harmonica Association sent out the sheet music for "Defend the Marco Polo Bridge" and "Defend North China," the demand has been overwhelming, which proves the people's patriotic enthusiasm. However, there were not many copies of the music available, so many people were disappointed later. They sent letters and telegrams requesting another shipment. Now, the association, unable to resist the enthusiasm, and driven by the patriotic heart of its president, Mr. Lu Chao Yin, has decided to send another 500 copies. Those who wish to request them can attach return postage. In addition to the above two songs, there is also a song called "War Song" included. The address is No. 252 Wenmiao Road, West Gate.</p>
