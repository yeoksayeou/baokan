<h3>國聯行政院會議中的法土糾紛</h3>
<p>— 輔</p>
<p>今年第一次的國聯行政院常会已定於本日在日内瓦開幕。出席的有英法蘇土波等國的外長。而由我國代表顧維鈞為主席。這次會議的重要問題有但澤自由市問題。法土二國關於叙里亞的少數民族問題及西班牙內戰中難民救濟問題。其中最重要的當推法土二國間關於的東殖民地的爭執問題。</p>
<p>法國與土耳其的關係一向是很友善的。這次的糾紛是由於叙里亞境內亞力山德萊物（Alexandretta）與安蒂沃希（Antioch）二地的管轄權問題而起。亞安二區是叙里亞西北角臨近海口的重要區域。戰前屬於土耳其。戰後則併入叙里亞而成為法國的委任統治地。不過亞安二城的居民多為土耳其人。所以一九二一年的安哥拉條約第七條規定“亞歷山德萊特區域應設一特殊行政制度治理。該區之土耳其籍居民應享受發展其本國文化之一切便利。土耳其語須認為正式文字”。以後在一九二六年之諸彿內爾協定（Luvenel　Agreement）中作同樣的聲明。這種條約的義務如果能切實施行。則二國間的爭執自不致發生。不過據土耳其政府的意見。法國並未切實履行此項條約義務。而對亞安二區的土耳其少數民族常有不公平的待遇。因此時向法國要求該二城歸還土國或另成立獨立區域。但在法國方面看來。土政府所持的理由不過是收回舊有領土的一種藉口。法人以為在亞安二區二十一萬九千人的居民中。土人僅有八萬五千人。佔全人口的百分之三十。人大部的居民還是阿拉伯人及其他民族。法人並舉出事實說明他們不曾歧視土人。如在二十三個市長中。土人佔十三席。阿人僅佔十席。在該區的行政機關中土人也佔多數。如公共工程•農業•教育與衛生等部部長均為土人。阿人祇擔任一財政部部長。</p>
<p>上面所說法土兩方的意見都是有相當的理由的。不過最近這問題之所以嚴重化。却並不是因為法人的歧視亞安區域的土耳其少數民族。而實由於近東形勢的轉變。近東形勢轉變的現象有二。第一。法國於去年與叙里亞拉巴嫩二委任統治地訂立條約。准許他們獨立並擬介紹加入國聯。這樣一來。土耳其自想乘機收回亞安區域。或使之成為獨立組織不受叙里亞獨立國的統治。其次。是最近土耳其外交政策之由消極性而轉為積極性。土耳其在過去十餘年中因埋頭建設。努力•圖強•國勢大盛。因此最近頗思向外發展。以圖收回戰後失地。如去年之恢復韃韃尼爾海峽區域的設防就是一例。最近對法要求收回亞安區域。亦卽此項積極外交政策的表現。</p>
<p>這次行政院例會的討論法土問題。是因為去年土耳其政府向行政院提出申訴。由行政院决議派遣三人調查委員會前往近東實地調查。在這次會議中提出報告。再作詳細的討論。我們現在雖還不能預料這問題的如何解决。但以過去法土的密切關係來看。則雙方必會作相當的讓步而使問題獲得圓滿的解决的。</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統就職宣誓維護憲法</h3>
<p>不公道疣瘤務盡使消除　民衆三十萬人參與盛典</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福今日就第二任總統職時所發之演說、聲明決將“不公道之疣瘤”消除一凈、此項疣瘤實使美國於豐富之中感覺缺乏、並决使每一美人悉為與其國家休戚相關之公民、</p>
<p>頃已嚴肅宣誓維護憲法之羅斯福總統、於其演說辭中對於憲法之權力、作廣泛之解釋、其言曰、“吾人之祖先以聯合行動之權力、建設健全之政府、自當年以迄於今日、凡屬困難問題之非個人及地方所能為力者、皆能迎刃而解决之、彼等建立聯邦政府、增進人民之幸福、並為美國人民、獲得自由之享受、今日吾人仍須乞靈於此項政府之權力、以達到同樣之目的、一七八七年之憲法、並未使吾人之民治精神、稍見減退”云、羅氏續云、復興之進步、極為明顯、惟自一九三三年以來所造就各方面之新制度、其意義猶不止此、“今以新材料用於社會之正義、吾人已從事在舊基礎之上、建築一種更能持久之結構、以供後世之更善之利用、”羅氏復謂、“今有一事與吾美之民治主義背道而馳者、卽今日有數千萬公民對於目下生活所需最低標準之大部份、猶靳而未之予、須知吾人進步之試驗、非為吾人是否使已富有者、更有所增、而為吾人是否能使享受過少者、有所饜足、”總統之結語曰、“假使余能盡知吾國之精神與宗旨、吾人自不致以享樂投機、及懦怯是尚、吾人必須向前進行、余今再度宣誓為總統、將擔負領導美國人民循彼等所擇定大道而前進之莊嚴義務、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］今日聚集國會前以觀羅總統行聯任就職禮之人民、達五萬之衆、適大雨如注、諸人皆遍體淋濕、天色雖晦暗、氣候則微逾水點、而人民之熱誠不為稍減、各處專誠來京觀盛者、多至三十餘萬人、軍隊游行迤邐頗長、羅總統在白宮外特建之觀壇日送彼等之經過、軍中旗幟飄揚、軍樂之聲洋洋盈耳、觀壇築成第七任總統𪝪克森氏家宅式、傑氏亦為民主黨、而亦聯任者、羅總統立處四周圍以玻璃、今日之典禮參與者以文員與軍隊之代表為限、第一隊為全國每一軍事單位與每一士官練習學校之代表一人、其次序依各州通過美國憲法之先後定之、由郵務長法萊氏領導、法萊氏為此次民主黨競選運動中之健將、羅總統獲選聯任、氏有大力焉、第二隊全為海陸軍軍人、平民保持地力團之團員四百人、各衣制服、手携鋤剷斧等、亦參與其間、華盛頓之旅館與寄宿所、皆告人滿、大旅館單人房間每夜之宿費至少收美金十元、故各旅館莫不利市三倍、（二十日路透電）</p>
<h3>美駐亞艦隊司令訪新加坡</h3>
<p>不無政治意味　兩國親善象徵</p>

<h3>日議會今日重開</h3>
<p>政民兩大黨無倒閣決心　龐大預算將成激烈爭點</p>
<p>［東京］日議會將於明日重開、此間政治空氣極為緊張、各政黨今日均分別召開大會、表示各該黨之態度、其中以政友民政兩黨之熊度尤堪注意、在衆議院中代表最大黨之民政黨之宣言、顯無倒閣之决心、宣言措詞之緩和、其表示染有政府黨之色彩、較昭和會為甚、政友會之宣言中、雖列舉政府各種失敗、但於結論中、對於根本改變現閣情形一點、亦表示極少力量、僅限於糾彈政府、社會大衆黨則與兩政府黨之宣言顯然不同、力言廣田內閣有傾覆之必要、關於對內對外政策之立塲、明白表示無餘、似足引起各方之注意、國民同盟及東方會雖亦同樣主張傾倒廣田內閣、但所根據之辯論理由、與社會大衆黨大相逕庭、其影響亦遠遜於社會大衆黨、觀察今日國會季節重開前夕之空氣、則現內閣雖障礙重重、仍能克服難關而繼續存在、蓋政民兩黨並未主張倒閣也、惟重要關鍵在於增稅計畫是否加以變更、而外交問題則較為次要云、（二十日中央社電）</p>

<p>外相述及近年來政府平日與國會開會之時外交事務實佔大地位、此實由於普通人民對和平表示之願望與憂慮有以致之、不幸此種現象迄未普遍、渠意非謂某種人民之願望和平、不若英國之殷切、僅言因乏表示意見與各地互通情愫之完全自由、致使世界輿論對和平未能施用其充分之勢力、此為英國所抱憾之事態、蓋英國深覺世界願望和平者、為數至衆、苟對互通情的的自由與言論的自由所設之一切壁壘、處處摧毀、則今日所存對和平之威脅、定可大减輕矣、外相次述及西班牙之內戰、謂目前西班牙之局勢、已使國際塲中其他一切事務均為减色、雖西班牙內戰或將陷歐洲於戰爭漩渦之危險未全消除、但此種危險已確受限制矣、如任何人相信西班牙內戰之結果、將為任何外強或列強統治西班牙卅年、卽管理其生活方法、與指導其外交政策是、渠以為是人實完全錯誤、一切結果中、此為是不致實現者、（衆歡呼）英國當然反對此種遭遇、此非英國一國所反對、蓋二千四百萬西班牙人亦一律反對之也、今唯一事件所能團結西班牙者、厥為共同厭惡外人是豪邁之西班牙人對於干涉西班牙事務至微之諸國、必將存至微之惡感、干涉之舉、終必為惡劣之人性、不特此也、且將為惡劣之政策、英國與西班牙固有利害之關係、但西班牙之應有特殊政體、無論其右傾或左傾、皆非英國所關、蓋英國如於此種事件定有主張、則將陷入相抗的思想之戰爭、此為英國所深惡者、職是之故、英國一向反對外方之干涉、今後仍將保持此志、</p>
<p>外相至是乃中止其辯論、以便釋明所已在下院問話時間提出之“事至關於不干涉之原則、外相切實聲明曰、“英意共同宣言中、無一字無一行無一點能予任何外國有干涉西班牙事務之權、無論該國任何部分之政府具何形態、”</p>
<p>外相於是乃續發辯論、謂英國對西班牙戰爭所關切者、有兩事焉、卽㊀戰爭不得蔓延至西班牙境外、㊁應保持西班牙政治獨立與土地完整、故不干涉西班牙內戰、將仍為歐洲所進行之正當政策焉、外相繼提起志願兵問題、而追溯自耶誕節前夕以來、英政府努力進行一種協定、俾可禁止外國人民加入西班牙雙方作戰團體之經過、並謂此項問題、未能早日提出實為致令某某數列強有此種派遣志願兵行為之原因、</p>
<p>外相述及法政府禁止其志願兵離境及加入西班牙作戰之法案時、謂各國政府如皆能若此、則彼等自可接近妥洽、决不如今日之意見衝突也、</p>
<p>外相因共產黨議員格萊却氏曾提出西班牙在英國境內召募兵士问题、故答稱、任何人之應徵前往西班牙者、其目的純為金錢、並非贊同其主義、觀於最近某英國應徵者之情形、卽可明瞭、蓋據此人聲稱、西班牙聘其為飛機駕駛員、每周薪金四十磅、並供給一切用費、此外如能繋下敵機一架、另給獎金五百磅也、</p>
<p>外相又引證某失業礦工之事例、謂此人在醉鄉時、被人誘赴西班牙、惟因中途清醒、遂離船逃回本國、</p>
<p>外相復提及西班牙境內人道主義之努力、謂大批俘虜交換談判之告失敗、西政府及國民軍雙方、皆應負其責任、</p>
<p>關於摩洛哥之地位、外相宣稱、所接英國駐該地總領事之報告、均可令人心慰、此外英政府對於和塔及米里拉爾地之調查、亦已接到報告、知外間有德國軍隊曾在該兩地登陸、或準備登陸之謠諑均無證據、外相又向下院保證、謂政府對於摩洛哥哥之局勢、將繼續予以嚴密之注意云、</p>
<p>外相又稱、英政府希望並深信英意地中海宣言成立之後、兩國間之緊張關係、必可告一段落、惟上項宣言之成立、並非英政府之政策有所改變、或英國方面作何讓步、況對於英國現存之任何友誼、亦無加以變動之處、其唯一之功用、卽對於地中海局勢之平定必大有裨益也、外相又稱、法外長台爾博氏、對英意地中海之宣言、極表歡迎、土耳其南斯拉夫、希臘及埃及等亦均表示贊同、</p>
<p>外相復聲言政府方面、已見到各種軍備之重行整頓、實為欲達到彼等目的之唯一必要方法、所謂目的者、即談判一種全歐之解決與鞏固國聯之權威是、外相均言政治的綏靖與經濟的合作、如望其成功：須賴各方面之戮力同心、如果能然、則吾人定能在和平世界中造成一個更美好更健全更繁榮之歐洲、惟欲達此目的、必須減低軍備費用、學習經濟的合作方法、應生活程度可以提高、</p>
<p>外相次述及德國、謂世界人士現紛紛詢問種族主義與國家主義將導德國與吾人全體至何處乎、歐洲若長此飄浮至日益渺茫之前途、若長此由國家敵對之黨派與大相違異之思想家撕成片片、則其生存之希望必渺乎其微、而其創痛必非數代所能平復、德國於决定其本國與全歐命運之舉、有選揮之勢力、若其選擇與歐州充分平等合作之一途、則英國將無一人不出其全力匡助銷除誤會、並治平達到和平與繁榮之大道、惟僅僅空談與局部之補救、卽能醫治吾人現所感之病痛、此種幻想實無裨益、故任何國於與他國合作及放棄干涉他國事務之企圖、咸不能稍存規避與退縮之念、</p>
<p>外相演說之結語、謂世界不能籍公約協定與高尚之演說以圖教治、救治之道、乃在放棄國家獨佔主義、接受歐洲各國為歐洲總解决中的有權利之合組者、减輕軍備至國防所必需之程度、接受國聯為解决一切事案之國際機關、共趨合作之一途、去而後和平始有希望焉、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>汴洛記行</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　明心</p>
<p>朔自上年十二月十二日陝變發生以來，瞬已經月，最初因蔣委長之在西安，對於陝境卽為積極之軍事布置，卽以蔣委長之安返南京，而軍事行動因以停止推進，乃自楊虎臣抗命以後，中央又不能不嚴陣以待，推諸本懷初無黷武之心，然日迫處此，所謂毒蛇在手，壯士斷腕，其勢固有不可以已者。鄭洛為通陝之惟一運輸途徑，因之亦卽成為後方之重心。記者歲晚天寒，不憚行役，蓋欲得其概況，以慰舉國人士之喁喁觀感也。記者由滬以歐亞航空機赴鄭，天風習習，原野穰穰，倦鳥慣飛，初無足述。漸又知歐亞別有包機，將逕赴西安，當時卽以為此一雁於雲羅必祥和之振導，雖後來成績不可預期，而信使往還，自屬不無餘地，竊願觀成，以俟其後。迨抵鄭站、記者則小駐鄭州，當時以為前綫旣在戒備，後方必見緊張。乃抵鄭之後，徜徉市衢，𠤎鬯不驚，轉滋駭異，訊之居停，始悟㊀軍事配備早已完成，此時但補充輪轉，故地面絕無驚動。㊁近歲治軍進步，過境士兵，絕無擅占居宅，強買強賣等事，因而人民咸與相安。㊂國民均認中國自強對外為惟一救國之途徑，對於國內小節認為迎刃可解，凡此均國家近年之進步，故值得為大書深刻者也。然返顧市塵，類多寂默，雖不受軍事過境之影饗；而於此農產豐收之際，仍不見其景氣。亦亟欲知其所由，刺訊厥故，萬有兩端，一以鄭州本為東西南北之通衢，更為棉花集中之所在，故其市面之榮衰繫於外來之行莊，而不在當地之銷耗，現蘇隴海西通，長安市面亦因有西向之勢，雖聚處勝於產地，然多少終受其影響。換言之，此或為發展西北之反映，而不必遽認為鄭州本地商市之退化也。二則今歲陝棉豐收，十二月中正待外運之際，忽起事變，車運中止，停頓關內者無慮數百十萬包。轉運一滯，金融亦感沉寂，此則暫時之變態，而亦不難於恢復者也。鄭市行政，日就整𩚠，市容亦佳，阮專員於破獲日本特務機關一案，不折不撓，循理持法，識者類稱道之，已詳各報，不待更贅。然友人或有見其文件之內容者，路述一二，足資解頤。蓋其主持之人，每多不實不盡之報告，甚至藏有空白之飯鋪發票多紙，用為虛造報銷之證明。又彼邦亦有嗜好甚深者，烟具俱在，此外冒濫支銷相互攻訐之文件，更屬不勝枚舉。故案發之後，彼邦大使館秘書及當地領事亦多感覺不安，足以知之矣。鄭市本習侈華，近則烟賭兩禁，對於吸戶，一按中央辦法，分年領照。雖僅自本年方始舉辦，而行遠自邇，有足稱者。記者逗留一日，躦程洛陽，得乘隴海新到之藍鋼車，舒適勝於滬平。隴海鐵路經錢宗澤之努力，數年以來，對於材料車輛機車路工，無不突飛猛進，得有今茲之成績。卽以去年計之，添機車二十餘輛，藍鋼車數列，貨車二萬餘噸位，修理廠機械種種逆計苦盡甘來，對於償付債欵，與發客運，已可操券而待。不意陝變之來，路政首受其衝物業毀損，客運停止，約略估計千有餘萬，何莫非國家之資源，路局之物力，是宜錢氏之每一提及，輒為欷噓太息而不能自己也。抵洛之後，一赴市塵，街道平整，人民熙攘，雖以臨時留駐軍旅之多，而市面初不見有紛擾之跡象，蓋所占用者多為公共地點，如圖書館學校之一部分而已。統軍大員多公寓於隴海路各住宅，此等住宅本供員司之居，劃併欵客；不覺困難，此彈丸之地，在一二八之際，固卽國民政府之行都，而此員司之居宅亦卽各部之所在，緬懷陳跡，彌漫可思。現者劉峙主任之行轅，卽設於國府所在，而巨額煌煌，儼然為國民政府四字，留此紀念，亦足為國人一發深省者乎。抵洛之後，卽知昨日赴陝之機已回南京，而陝方較有和平之可能，悔禍之意象，此則尤為跋涉中所得之好消息，足為通信之結語者矣。（十六日發於洛陽）</p>

<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>粉麥頻跌不休</p>
<p>英美麥價低落激動市氣　粉麥價格過高需求减縮　麥又小角半粉又跌七五</p>
<p>麥市昨據路透社十九日利物浦電、利物浦麥市、因受阿根廷小麥之壓迫、加以美國冬麥有豐收希望、多方乃巨額出籠、三月份拋出尤夥、惟長期因素利多、如加麥裝出過多、阿根廷新麥之品質如何、各國增加儲備糧食、例如謠傳英國以儲糧為國防計劃等、再雜糧用作飼料情形仍緊、德國小麥存底極少、去年十一月份內、德麥存底僅五二一、〇〇〇噸、按前年十一月份存底達一、三二五、〇〇〇噸、因此對麥市長心思者看好、</p>
<p>芝加哥麥市因外國市軟多頭了結、大衆賣出、跌二分一二五至二分三七五、</p>
<p>本埠麥市、亦見不振、國內粉銷、因價高而無形减縮、麥市當不能獨榮、開市後、各月份卽跌五六分至八九分、迨至下午開盤、本月份則因距交割祇四五日、有貨者頗思交貨、惟廠胃則平淡如常、致人心更虛、續小五六分、遠期人心較定、衹續小一三一分、現麥市面、因標準暴跌無已、價亦非殺不可、所以全趨停頓云、</p>
<p>粉市上午開盤後、各月份續見暴跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌七角零、坎拿大跌四•六•七角不等、利物浦跌一便士零、故開價後、市塲人心、大為衝動、因洋麥之頻頻報跌、國內人心、亦因實銷停頓而轉變、故近遠期開價、較前日卽鬆跌五六分、後則人心繼虛、市氣續軟、惟連日慘跌、一部分浮空、已起而補進、故人心彷彿暫定、迨至下午開盤、本月份因交割已近、多頭又非了不可、故最低之開價、竟至三元八角三分半、二月份亦低至三元八角六分、三月份至三元九角零五厘、與前日之收價、差度已及一角、後則多頭出檔較寂、空頭又均思補、故逐步回穩二三分、觀於年前之節節上漲、大有絕貨之勢、今則跌無止境、毫無反顧、良因供求之情不同、遂致江河日下云、</p>
<p>豆餅破二元關</p>
<p>跌價後汕頭帮進辦甚暢</p>
<p>昨日豆餅市况因大連連日瀉跌、本市人心致下游、先由行販國戶出籠、所以“四牌餅”行情立見甩跌、且值貨厚廠家喊賤兜售、故市價跌進二元大關、削至一元九角八分、當引起汕頭帮趁賤暢進、結果成交各廠四牌餅二萬三千片、又成交訂期交易計大德新廠開出二月份交一萬五千張、三月份交五千張、照前途趨勢、暫時或可不致過修、良以去路尚有問津、且豆價不易過辱、但大結束期迫、中途或尚有變遷也、</p>
<p>廣帮逢小購進客秈</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况、晨間本客去華甚呆、市價立小角外、旋以廣帮連日停辦、今見價小合算、立卽在市暢辦各路糙米、總計達二萬包之多、機米亦辦去二三千包、本街本無暢胃、因廣帮活潑、亦稍酬應、故全日亦復成去三四千包、全日交易甚旺、總計開出二萬六千包、然市價仍見疲削數分至近角、因粵帮吃價甚緊、而市上存到兩多、貨主與行販亦力求貶價暢脫、故成交之多實被貶價所引起也、</p>
<p>河米北市去路稍暢</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到四十餘號、貨約八千三四百石、內中簿稻有二十號左右、本街銷暢逐日鮮有採取、包胃又復不振、祇青島烟台帮辦薄稻二千餘包、故形勢頓呈垂軟、結果除高料因貨稀尚形平定外、中段貨悉修數分至角許、厚粳更難立定、續削一角有奇、就現狀而論、一時似少轉好之望也、杜尖跟小五分、洋尖去路較滯、更貶一角陰變元因到貨有限、當無上落耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各地來源三十三四艘、市上各種交易、稍見活動、自粳上中之貨、價形平疲、中下者價緊三四分、羊尖貨少、價繁近角、簿稻價加六七分、早稻跟昂數分、白元略見緊勢杜埠羊尖及其餘各貨價挺立之局、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>現紗售價大跌標準市面動搖</p>
<p>廠根寬鬆空頭活動　本月交貨籌碼充足</p>
<p>紗市盤旋數日、昨則跌風突起、因現銷沉寂、廠根日漸寬鬆、人心虛弱、現紗售價大跌、於是空頭紛紛活躍市價愈難支持、又說本月份交貨籌碼充足、因此賣風殊熾、多方曁印商多額非但不出至收盤時二月期以下一律仍拖進市價被其撐住矣、</p>
<p>標紗近期尤疲</p>
<p>標紗的市開盤、各月參差不一、近月疲乏、遠期略定、因本月交割時期漸近、傳言有三四千包交貨、故多方雖把持、市面仍無上漲力、同時現紗交易清寂、目售價步步下降、人心怠懈、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌一二七角、午後開盤、跌風驟起、賣勢忽強、蓋以現紗售價大跌、二十支紅人鐘紗比上日價猛瀉五六元之譜、於是人心打動、受其影響、市價步開步下、至收盤時多方又來買進虛弱被其支持、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一元八角至二元一角、查資出大孚一千三百十包愼記一千三百包、恒德九百包、森康二千零五十包、長餘一千七百五十包、潤康三千三百包、恒昌八百五十包、新華九百包、買進恒益二千四百包、長豐七百包、賡豐四千六百五十包、昶記六百包、仁豐八百五十包、益昶一千二百包、長豐五千一百五十包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現紗跌三四元</p>
<p>現紗銷路仍屬平淡、查全日各帮買去統計四百三十六包、售價跌三四元之譜、各帮買額列下、江西　五　廣東　七五　內地｜五八　同行　二五　長沙｜０　寧波　｜０　河南　｜五三　合計　四三五</p>
<p>棉花被棉紗帶小</p>

<p>至就各種茶葉之輸出狀况而言、紅綠茶及其他茶之出口、均較二十四年增加、尤以綠茶增數為最多、查綠茶去年輸儘非洲頗旺、在今日固為在中國綠茶唯一銷納市塲、觀其開展亦正方興而未艾、惟據說某國綠茶極思侵佔該處市塲、近復利用傾銷政策、積極開拓銷路云云、此甚值得吾茶葉界之注意也、</p>
<p>至磚茶之輸出則大形衰落、查磚茶大抵運銷蘇俄、近年蘇俄國內亦有大規模茶葉經營、漸有趨向自給自足之境、華茶失此一大主顧實遭莫大之影響焉、茲將二十五年每月出口數量租最近三年總數比較、及國別統計列表如下、以供關心茶葉者之參考（單位公担）</p>

<h3>羅四維</h3>
<p>— 蘇子涵</p>
<p>堅决是力量</p>
<p>羅四維生平做事决不含糊，無論甚麼事一到他手裹，他便知道這事應該怎樣辦，辦得正對。羅四維雖說沒有讀過幾本書，却有的是一肚皮的春秋。</p>
<p>羅四維有一點田，但是並不多，四四方方一整塊，𥄨着却也逗人愛。這塊田眞也不壞，水方便，種稻，種麥子，種菜蔬全有收成。羅四維便是靠這塊田長到這樣年紀的。</p>
<p>在從前，這塊田的周圍團轉全是這樣的田，住着的也全是像羅四維這樣種田的人。但是這二三七年來變了漸漸的變了。好好的田地變成了草地，變成了球塲，變成了“洋房”，“洋房子”裹全住的高鼻子綠眼睛的“洋人”，一天比一天多。後來又招上許多中國學生，辦了一些甚麼大學，大學，還有甚麼坎拿大學堂。</p>
<p>這些田賣得都可得價。譬如值一百一畝的吧，至少也得賣上一百五，有時竟可以賣兩三百；羅四維這塊田“洋人”就出過三百五一畝，但是羅四維不想錢，不賣。你“洋人”再利害，會壓迫人，一百二十個不賣，便也沒有辦法。</p>
<p>十幾年來，羅四維周圍團轉的地全變成“洋人”的了。但是羅四維不管這些，仍然種他的田，澆他的糞。臭氣從草地上飄過，從窗戶裹闖進洋房子裹去。</p>
<p>羅四維這塊地剛在這特殊區域的心中。四面全是非常好看的“洋房子”同草地，中間夾上幾間草房，確也不甚好看。“洋人”日裹夜裹都想把這塊地拿過去，但是錢買不動羅四維的心，只好乾瞧着羅四維，在田塊上澆糞。</p>
<p>“洋人”恨極了羅四維，不知聽了甚麼人的話，在隔羅四維草房不遠的地方，修了一座鐘樓。這鐘樓可也費了不少工程，只磚就花了多少萬塊，一座鐘樓才矗立在“戀愛池”上了。——這個特殊區域是成都風景頗好的地方，春秋佳日，星期例假；有不少的人去逛，其中便有不少的“愛人”，也有不少的流氓濫娼。所以許多人都把這個水塘叫做“戀愛池”。</p>
<p>羅四維看見鐘樓那樣高，起初頗吃一驚，過後仔細一行量，這座鐘樓恰好在自己草房的左上方。羅四維當下便同自己開開玩笑，嚼念道：“左青龍，右白虎，青龍抬頭；好的，我大吉大利，年年發財！洋鬼子，你錯打了主意。”</p>
<p>種地，澆糞，羅四維照常過他的生活，不瞅不睬。</p>
<p>“洋人”便會從此作罷嗎？不會的。於是三頭兩日的羅四維家裹全有人來囉唣，軟硬齊來。好在羅四維有一肚皮春秋，打定了主意：不賣！九牛拉不轉，白刀進紅刀子出也是那麼一回事！不賣定了！</p>
<p>起初羅四維不想賣這塊田地，不過想着這是祖宗傳下來的，自己的吃穿又敷得過，何必賣牠，自己落一個敗家子的名聲。過後有一年，“洋人”們忽然要在四週修墻，隔斷了小路，壅塞了水道，大家都反對了。“華西壩”裹時常都有學生來演講，說：這個學校是外人侵略中國西南地方的大本營，現在要修墻，便是想在川康有事的時候，把這地方做一個保壘，做一個要塞。我們不能讓他修。</p>
<p>羅四維聽了才恍然大悟，便心裹打算道：“怪不得老要買我的田，才是想打成一片，更好做事。好，現在我更不賣了，洋鬼子要出事，我便做內應，同他們搗蛋。”</p>
<p>羅四維不賣田，已經不單是為了田是祖宗的遺產了。</p>
<p>那次“洋人”們的墻並沒有修成，已經修好的也被民衆推倒了。</p>
<p>這一天，是一個春天的好天氣，早上便沒有雲，日頭直射在鐘樓的頂上。羅四維坐在草房外面，嘴裹吸着葉子烟袋。“戀愛池”邊也有人在活動了。</p>
<p>麥子長得正茂盛，白菜同青菜也茂盛，白裏雜綠，綠裹雜白，像遍地的花，非常好看。</p>
<p>莊稼好，羅四維心裹說不出的高興。</p>
<p>正在這當兒，炭層路上來了一個人，走到小路口，一拐彎，便向羅四維的草房走來。</p>
<p>越走越近，羅四維看清楚了來人，心裹便罵道：“又是這個傢伙”不覺“呸”了一口，一口唾沫便落在地裹。</p>
<p>來人原來是袁華袁老師，專門替“洋人”跑腿的人。</p>
<p>羅四維心裹僅管不高興袁華，但是來者是客，做主人不能不招待，只好站起來招呼道：“袁老師，你好！請坐吧。”說着便推了一個竹凳過去。</p>
<p>袁華也笑嘻嘻的說：“四維，你好！大家坐吧。”兩個人都落了坐。羅四維看見袁華的笑臉兒，便想道：“準是又來說買田的話了。</p>
<p>果不其然，談了三五句家常話過後，袁華便扯到買田的話了。他道：“四維，我勸你還是賣了好。你瞧！周圍團轉全是教會的了，哎，不是，全是學堂的了，你種這一點做甚麼。他們已經出到五百大洋一畝了，你賣了吧。”</p>
<p>羅四維道：“我不賣！”</p>
<p>袁華又道：“五百大洋一畝，這價錢多好！你打着燈籠找遍天下也找不出這價錢來。那面朱家的田起初還是不賣，現在聽說只要價錢好，還是賣的。他一賣，這裹只剩你一個的田了，更覺得不好。四維哥，不要錯過了好價錢！”</p>
<p>羅四維大聲道：“我不賣！”</p>
<p>袁華笑了笑，羅四維不看他。袁華從懷裹摸出一盒紙烟，給羅四維一支，羅四維拿手一推：“我不吸！”但是袁華自己却吸上了。</p>
<p>袁華笑着又道：“老哥，價錢好，賣了的好。”</p>
<p>羅四維按不住了，跳起來道：“袁老師，你也太囉唆了！我說不賣就不賣。你秤兩棉花去訪一訪，我羅四維在南台寺這一轉是出了名的，說怎樣幹便怎麼幹。我不賣，你說也是白說。我羅四維不是見錢眼開的人！”</p>
<p>袁華看見羅四維氣得那樣兒，他一點也不動氣，却拿出手段來恐嚇道：“他絕了你的水道呢！”</p>
<p>羅四維道：“絕了水道我會去找堰工會。他敢！”</p>
<p>袁華又道：“他糟蹋你們莊稼呢？”</p>
<p>羅四維道：“那除非沒有王法。他放來，來了白刀子進去，紅刀子出來。”</p>
<p>袁華又笑道！“老哥，賣了吧，我給校務長說，再弄一個事給你。”</p>
<p>羅四維大怒道：“滾你的蛋罷！”說完便去拿糞桶，準備澆菜。不理袁華，袁華自討無趣，只好溜了。</p>
<p>當羅四維澆菜的時候，他看見一個“洋人”用手巾掩着鼻子走過去了，心裹覺得得意，臉上便浮一層笑容。</p>
<p>一直到現在，這特殊區域中央的一塊地，還是羅四維的。</p>

<h3>怎樣研究哲學（七）</h3>
<p>— 嚴以霖</p>
<p>王特夫著三江書店發行</p>
<p>㊈哲學發展史的概要　哲學發展史大體可劃分三個時期：第一，是古代希臘的哲學，第二，宗教統治期的哲學，第三，近代哲學。古代希臘哲學是由米勒特學派的泰利期開其端的；他生於米勒特市，為紀元前六世紀時人，被稱為哲學之鼻祖。牠拿水來作為萬有基本原則；泰利斯的自然觀是含有極重要的意義。至愛勒亞學派的建立者巴鬥尼得，他以物質而兼精神的“有”為世界之唯一的本體，這已暗中含有懷疑派的觀念的理論了；及至畢達哥拉斯，主張輪迴轉生說，這完全是復回於宗教的迷信。米勒特學派和愛勒亞學派的宇宙觀的根本對立•到紀元前五世紀中葉田恩比多克創發了綜合的運動，再到安那克薩哥拉斯，柳西卜，德模克利特•在德模克利特看來，感覺是認識的唯一泉源，思維是經過感官而反映的和我們從外界獲得的印象，他是古代希臘算一個最有系統的唯物論者。自後，希臘哲學發生懷疑自然的理論與對於人事特別注意的傾向。這時新起了懷疑派中的普洛達哥拉斯，懷疑了感官的可靠性，已漸接近唯心論。接着是蘇格拉底，柏拉圖，亞里士多得等一個系統的出現；他們的宇宙本源論是精神先於物質，其認識論和方法論亦以抽象的觀念上的原理為出發點。自後唯物論方面還有伊壁鴆魯，克魯斯，折衷論方面有司多亞學派的惹諾，懷疑學派方面有卑魯倫。這是古希臘哲學發展的大概。第二，是宗教統治時期的哲學，這時期從紀元前開始直到文藝復興止，有新柏拉圖學派和新畢達哥拉斯學派。哲學在四世幻之前是已變為神學的婢女了，以基督教為唯一獨說的神學哲學，發展成為教父哲學與經院哲學，支配了整個中世紀之千餘年代。第二，近代哲學的再起，是在上三世紀洛傑培根。由培根復活起來的唯物論，到霍布士更加澈底了，十七世紀的英國唯物論到斯賽諾莎，洛克，是很詳細和充分地在那裹解决認識問題了，在十六七世紀法國，却出現了笛卡兒的哲學，他主張精神與物體成為相反的對立那種理論，完全是二元論的本色。十八九世幻的後起者是有名的巴克來，休謨，乃至於葉布尼茲，是在英國德國出現的唯心論的健將。至一七二四年康德降世，他綜合了柏拉圖，笛卡兒的先天觀念論，綜合了霍布士和洛克的感覺論和經驗論，同時也綜合了巴克來和休謨的純感覺主義，純經驗主義和物不可知的懷疑主義，他一樣是以承認了實體的萊布尼茲哲學為出發點，而又兼有自然主義的。從康德到費希特，謝林格，馬赫，這又是一番唯心論或唯物論的爭辯。最後是唯心論中最偉大的黑格爾，但其主要的影響却在於唯物論方面，經過費爾馬赫，到馬克思，恩格斯，拉發格，到考茨基，蒲列哈諾夫，列寗等便是最重要唯物論哲學者了。這就是近代哲學發展的概略。</p>
<h3>袁英昌的孔雀東南飛及其他（三）</h3>
<p>— 夔風</p>
<p>二、其他獨幕劇</p>
<p>本劇獨的白地方太多且長，而且是情節關鍵地方，表達的力量就嫌弱了。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>戲裹面的停頓，是做成情節逐漸緊張的空氣預伏。戲雖含有表現人生的意義，但是平常生活裹的煩文縟節，也插進在戲裹面，是非常要不得的。</p>
<p>第一幕裹，姥姥來焦府，有一段對話</p>
<p>“妹媽媽，我去叫人拿茶來給姥姥喝，好吧？</p>
<p>母好的，你去。還拿點橘子和栗子來給姥姥嚥茶。</p>
<p>姥別費事！我們談談好了。</p>
<p>妹不費事！</p>
<p>第二幕</p>
<p>“妹那就費姥姥的心！（這時使女捧進茶菓。向使女）太太進來了沒有？</p>
<p>使女剛進來。在房裏洗臉</p>
<p>妹你去請她，說姥姥來望她了（使女點頭出去小妹奉茶菓給姥姥）姥姥，請點！”</p>
<p>這手法，在作者也許作為空氣停頓的利用，但，認眞說來，表現在舞台上的戲，最犯重復的穿插，同時，這種穿插，並不是最好的培植空氣的方法。</p>
<p>關於整個的意見，大體摘要有這四點，就這已超過預定要說的話了。</p>
<p>總之，劇作者寫作的雄心是可佩服的，尤其是拿新的觀點來翻造旣有的樓台，這試作企圖，是難得的，雖然，在技巧上有許多缺點。不過，我們不能忽略這是五六年前的成績，以進步的現代的劇作來比較，自然不免有形式，方法落後之義，而在近代戲劇史上，是有它存在的價值的。</p>
<p>A各劇梗概</p>
<p>孔雀東南飛之外，尚有五個獨幕劇，計活詩人，究竟誰是掃帚星，前方戰士，結婚前的一吻，人之道。</p>
<p>活詩人，究竟誰是掃帚星，結婚前的一吻均是喜劇，兼含有諷刺意味的喜劇。前方戰士屬愛國劇，人之道却為婚姻問題的悲劇了。</p>
<p>話詩人寫一女孩有三個愛的對象，為作最後决定，特於一次榮會上，請三青年各寫詩一篇，詩才優勝者，卽與之訂婚。於寫詩時，青年之一為叙一白貓，為黃狗咬傷。評判者卽斷此青年為活詩人。因：一詩人必有詩人的人格，詩人必有詩人的情感。沒有眞擊的情感與高尚完美的人格……也不能成為眞正的詩人，活生生的詩人！王君今天不顧自己的性命，有劣狗口裹救出弱小無能的小貓，在他個人勝敗交關之際而能顧全小生物的性命，這在我看起來不特是個詩人，而且是個眞正的活詩人。”這段話可說是寫作本劇的主旨。</p>
<p>究竟誰是掃帚星，寫一有夫之婦，愛上丈夫的朋友，在已將離婚時，發見所愛的人述于嫉妒，失望而復回到原夫處。</p>
<p>結婚前的一吻，純然是一個近于胡鬧的喜劇，因為故事决非現實所有者。不過，大體上不失于歌頌愛情的意思。</p>
<p>前方戰事，寫民國時軍閥張宗昌，不就革命軍範，尊命軍方面一小卒，其家老小為張部下所據，要挾小卒協助叛逆。小卒不為利誘，寧可犧牲全家生命，而捉獻漢奸，處以軍法。主旨寫參加革命的同志，有了堅定信仰，卒獲到精神上的勝利。</p>
<p>人之道是一般的習見的婚姻，家庭，戀愛所交相錯綜的一個問題。換言之，卽是戀愛與義務的對峙的問題。寫一留學生回國後遺棄原妻，而與另一留學的女子結婚，組織戀愛家庭，不負担為丈夫，做父親的責任，只圖個人生活幸福。最後良知突發，然愛子病死，妻子自殺，一切都晚了。</p>
<p>B劇的內容與當時的時代意義</p>
<p>統觀各劇，不論是悲劇，喜劇，而其諷世，醒人的用以卻是一貫的，六七年前的社會，五四運動之後，中西文化溝通最盛之時，而於這時候，自由戀愛學說也就倡行，一時，究竟誰是掃帚星，人之道這類事中，的確不是杜撰的。當然，能夠覺悟掙扎出來的，是喜劇，否則就釀成了死亡，流離，瘋狂等悲劇。</p>
<p>民十八，九年的社會動態是如此，而反應在文學著作裹是不出于這一個定型的。袁昌英的這幾個獨幕劇自也不會例外。</p>
<p>同時，一方固然表現出醜惡的一面，他方也在祈求着完美幸福的戀愛婚姻，活詩人，結婚前的一吻，是掩藏不了這些消息的。</p>
<p>在革命軍北伐以後，國際間局勢尚沒有今日這麼緊逼，掃除軍閥，建設政治，是民衆的祈望，是當局的理想，這祈望，這理想並非沒有兌現的希望。前方戰士的確可以代表當時的多數軍民的信仰，精神勝利的實現，作者可把握住了這一命題的。（未完）</p>

<p>梁翁致詞</p>
<p>㊀財政部所得稅駐滬辦事處主任梁和鈞致詞云、諸位代表、今天兄弟得與在座各地商會領袖、參加此研究會、至深榮幸、我國過去所有的賦稅、都是間接稅、所得稅是直接稅、我國何以要舉辦直接稅的所得稅呢、簡單說來、實在可以說、在國家的立塲上說、所得稅便是國難稅、雖然、這一個國難稅的名詞、在各國財政學上是沒有的、可是在一七九八年、英法交戰時、英國始有所得稅的濫觴、美國當南北戰爭時期、亦為戰時財政而繼起創行、此外德•法•俄•都是在戰爭時期舉辦的、我們大家知道、我們國家現在所處的是怎樣一個嚴重局面、我們也知道、我們政府、在財政上的最大宗收入是鹽稅和關稅、可是國家在危難的時期、人民不會增加鹽的消費、鹽稅當然、是不會增加了、至於關稅、說來痛心、在平時關稅多收一分、我們血汗多流一分、所以關稅的增收、不是合理化的、而况逢到國家危難時期、運輸交通方面、能否不發生困難、外國貨能否如平時源源而來、都成問題、那末關稅在國家危難時期、當然是更不可靠、遑論收入增加了、國家現在所處的環境、其嚴重性與危難的成分、諸位自然都能洞悉、在此危急存亡之秋、國家舉辦所得稅的意義、是不難瞭然的、所以所得稅在危難時期、實為政府最大的稅源、在危難過去、也是唯一良好的稅制、因為第一是課稅的方法、絕對公道的平均的、在事實上、我們多一個所得、方𦆵多納一分稅欵、在理論上、又可以養成國民愛國的觀念、政府在過去、久有舉辦所得稅的計劃、因為諸如財產登記、人口統計等等、千頭萬緒、一時未能實行、現在環境旣日趨危迫、於是此足以應付危迫環境的良稅、便不得不决然實施了、國家是我們的國家、報國是我們的責任、替國家納一分稅欵、卽盡國民一分義務、擁護所得稅、卽擁護國家、可是我們不明白稅制的內容、是不易推行的、所以今天起、由上海市商會主持、在此開會研究、兄弟敢說、研究的結果、對於我們國家發生的影響、一定很大的、希望在座諸位代表深切研究、並儘量指導我們、㊁財政部所得稅辦事處委員翁之鑄致詞云、關於所得稅之意義、剛才梁委員已有詳細說明、不再贅述、惟兄弟有幾句報告、當民國二十三年舉行財政會議時、頗覺中國整個財政問題、一無出路、嗣經會議决定三種步驟、卽一•廢除苛捐雜稅、二•確定地方預算、三•整理舊稅、四•推行良稅、其時深認欲求國民經濟向上、財政上軌道、非循此方針進行、不克有濟、至今歷時二年零六月、雖無顯著成効、但亦有相當段落、計廢除苛雜結果、約在五千五百餘萬元、各地之預算、除東三省新疆等及事實上感有困難者外、已有一千三百餘縣辦竣、如今正應辦理推行良稅之所得稅工作、所得稅為各國通行之稅、其舉辦之初、均感覺困難、吾國國民教育較淺、各業統計尚欠完備、會計制度參差不一、困難自亦難免、好在政府對於稅法及征收手續、均力求標準合理化、國民一方面希望廢除苛雜、另一方面對於良稅所得稅、卽應盡力擁護推行、現在吾國所得說法、雖非近代國家最佳之法、深信經過相當程序、必有可觀進步、此有賴於各業共同研討、貢獻意見、政府莫不樂於接受也、</p>
<p>研究步驟</p>
<p>梁翁致詞畢、卽由徐永祚會計師報告本會發起經過、及嗣後研究步驟、當經决定分為四天、第一天研究營利事業所得、第二天研究薪給報酬所得、第三天研究證券存欵所得、第四天研究所得稅與會計問題、同時卽由商會與徐會計師當塲贈送所得稅與會計十講、及暫行條例施行細則各一册、至五時散會、並宣佈二十一日下午二時、继续舉行、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談廣九路快車失愼案</h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>廣九路快車的失愼，起火原因，到現在還在“將在廣州開會研究，俾明眞相”中，“眞相”如何，那有待於“開會研究”後的報告。不過根據於現在見到的電訊，加以想像，我們也大抵可以相信火是由於“松香質之玩具”而起的。據十七日的本報快電所云，則係：“原因係有化學玩具兩籮，置於三等卡厠中，因車行簸動着火，火向下燃着車輸之滑機油，加以車快風急，故轉瞬燃燒三車”，這一說和十八日的路透電雖稍有出入，但可以互為補充；據路透電云：“此次火災，乃由乘客一人偶爾不愼，將火觸及松香質之玩具，頓時延及各種行李……”。可見松香質之玩具甚多是實情，而起火之是否“簸動着火”，抑是“乘客不愼將火觸及”，則還有待於調查。不過以常情來猜測，後一說大概是較可能的。</p>
<p>不管是怎樣的起火，我們且來看死傷的情形吧，據當局的公告，則此次慘案，一共死七十七人，傷三十五人”，而另據路透社的電訊呢，則“迄今罹難者之人數，已遠一百零五人”。不管是一百另五還是七十七，向來被認為辦理較為完善的鐵道，而有這樣不幸的空前的慘案發生，實在是使人欲言無從的。</p>
<p>這次慘變的致禍之因，據我們的想像，實在是由於太疏忽，太隨便所致，不論是“化學玩具兩籮”或“藏於盥洗室中之硫酸突然爆炸了，（路透十七日電有此一說）將危險物品隨意擱在乘客出入的公共地方，那不待慘案的發生，管理者就難免於玩忽業務之咎，若說此項物品還是私帶，不管是乘客或是車上職員的，則管理員更應有追究來源的職責！</p>
<p>而更不幸的，則是在火起後，一直至延燒第三車，司機者乃察覺而停駛”。如果司機者再不察覺，疾駛如故，則慘案將更不堪設想一定是必然的，而司機所以一時無從得知者，則“車中因未裝有報急機關，致一時無從警告司機者”，而所以未裝報急機關者，則云是“蓋防乘客無知，任意掣此警繩，故未作此設備也”。</p>
<p>因為怕“乘客無知，任意掣此警繩”，以致“未作此設備”，這理由的天眞着實不下於“因噎廢食”，而環觀別的公共塲所的報警設備，好像也並無“乘客無知任意……“等情，則火車上的沒有報警設備是否是怕“乘客無知”，也就深堪使我們玩味的了！</p>
<p>由於未裝報急設備，使我連帶想起來的，則是此次火災何以不發生於頭一等車而却發生在三等車的問題，這問題我實在不忍想，而有一個問題却是想提出來問的：頭二等車的盥洗室或廁所中，有沒有，能不能堆那些“化學玩具”或“硫酸”等危險物品？</p>
<p>亡羊補牢，本為未晚，不過對這次慘案，我們在希冀亡羊補牢，不再以三等乘客的人命為兒戲之餘，還望對這次肇禍的起因，加以澈究！</p>
<p>路局或是疏忽容忍的理由，而乘客則為了自身的安全，却不能無視於這次的慘劇了。</p>
<h3>蛇廟巡禮</h3>
<p>— 南鷗</p>
<p>到過檳榔嶼的人，大都去游過極樂寺的吧。極樂寺是一個古中國風味的地方，沒有什麼出奇，我去了是不大感到興味的。這一次到檳榔嶼，是回國的船經過此地，只作半日的勾留，招待我的是舊友老容：“要不要上什麼地方去玩玩呢？”在一家吉寧人開的咖哩飯店吃過了飯，他這樣地問我。檳城對於我該不是生疏的了，以前我曾特地來玩過。極樂寺，關係於這些地方我都表示不再想去了，要是眞沒有可玩的去處，那未就逛逛這裹的街市也好。檳榔嶼街上那靜謚，清凈的情調，我是很歡喜的：當我帶着異鄉人底眷戀走向海岸邊去時，那半掩在二層樓上的窗縫裹的娘惹㊀底星星一樣的眼睛，不是太迷人了麼，那一次的檳城之游雖然是兩年前的事情了，却給了我難以忘却的印象哩。</p>
<p>老容想了一下，突然拍着桌子呌道：“有了！有了！你還沒有去過蛇廟啊！”</p>
<p>“蛇廟？”我覺得太離奇，並且以前的確沒有聽到過蛇廟。於是他便告訴我，蛇廟一定多少可以給我一點刺激，那裹的風物的確不很平常。我們算了一下時間，覺得還很充裕，便雇了一輛汽車，上蛇廟去了。</p>
<p>在飛駛而去的汽車中，老容的莫地告訴我關於蛇廟底情形。旣然呌做蛇廟了，裹邊一定有着蛇的；老容說，檳地底土人，有的祟拜着蛇，把蛇當作了神，不特不敢傷害牠們，並且向牠們祈禱，磕頭哩。南洋土人腦筋底原始，我是知道的：在人類文化史上，落後的民族底迷信到底還是一樁不可思議的事實。這時，我的確有點興奮了，用一種好奇的心，希望汽車趕緊開到蛇廟底門前。</p>
<p>蛇廟究竟是怎樣的一個地方呢？到了那裹，跟自家底想像竟是那麼的不同！廟屋是狹小而破舊的，若以宏麗的極樂寺一比，實在差得太遠啦。隨在老容底背後一步一步地走近廟門，從那裹邊傳來一股異樣的腥味，在廟門上，蛇底影子就出現了，是一些青色的小蛇。我一怔，差點呌出聲來；老容可笑了，他說“不要怕，蛇變了神的時候是不咬人的呢！”但是，對於蛇，我素來是懼怕的，現在一邊想不再進去了，一邊又為好奇心所驅使，而希望進去看看到底是怎樣的一種情形。我終於和老容一道進去了，看看四周，光綫很陰森，蛇底影子佔滿了屋樑，神龕，鼓架，燭檯……這些蛇被濃烈的香火味𤋱得一動也不動地纏繞在那裹，偶爾一動，我底神經就一震，像老容那麼鎮靜的態度，我是無論如何做不到的。在神桌前，正有一個土人在虔神地磕頭嘴裹不知道喃喃地在唸些什麼。後來老容問了他，得到的回答是他底兒子正在生病，請了兩次醫生</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>看後都没有起色，因此他就到這裏來求神底庇佑。這土人有一張被生活壓服了的，多縐紋的臉，我心裏雖説很同情他，却懷疑着他的祈禱是不是能够得到效騐……</p>
<p>要看，在蛇廟是没有什麽可看的。而距離我上船的時間又快到了，我和老容便出了蛇廟，仍然坐了原來那部汽車回去。</p>
<p>這一次路過檳城，就祗見了老容，一同去過蛇廟。早知蛇廟是那樣一個地方，我到情願在那静謚的街上，浴着陽光散歩呢。</p>
<h3>酒店門前</h3>
<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>秋天，日子是短暫的，鎮上的小店剛吃完晚飯就排上店門了。泥濘的土路是一片黑暗。在進鎮的大路上只有裕成酒店還沒有打烊，一片灰黃色的燈光切斷了小路的黑暗。</p>
<p>在酒店進門的第一隻方檯上，有三個人正在低聲談着話兒,一種焦灼的表情使得他們的臉孔更加陰鬰起來。</p>
<p>“已是时候了，難道癩痢出了岔子麽？”</p>
<p>接着是一片的沉默,野村入夜是異常荒凉的，野狗狺狺地吠着。</p>
<p>一陣西風打街而吹過，雨滴落在街心的水沼上，發出低沉的寂寞的微聲，像小魚的喋唼一樣。</p>
<p>像幽靈一般，一個人影出現了。來人帶着棕㮨䉟，滿足的黃泥，他就是癩痢。他走近櫃頭，以手支頣，把水淋淋的斗笠摘下來，一頭蓬亂的頭髪，一個蒼白而痙攣着的臉龐，水滴從斗笠的邊緣一滴一滴地滴着……</p>
<p>三個坐客像有了不吉的預感，都噤住了，眼睛怯怯地望着他。</p>
<p>“鍘了呢！”癩痢用一種裂帛樣的聲音呌了起來。</p>
<p>櫃頭上坐着的掌櫃馬上把手從算盤上抽下來，瞪着眼睛問：</p>
<p>“什么？金生給鍘了！說呢，癩痢。”</p>
<p>癩痢移着身子，坐在條凳上，雙手猛搔着他的稀疏的頭髪，許多不小的白點像雪一樣的溜下來。突然他抬起頭來，翻了翻眼睛：“唉，早上給鍘了啦！……”他說着俯下頭去，雙足不斷地猛蹬着地面。</p>
<p>這經驗他們太熟悉了。擺在他們面前的是一幅使人動魄的塲面。在車站旁邊的木柱上，吊着一個小木籠，一個發腫的，露牙的，眼睛像死魚的一樣的人頭塞在裹面，從給切碎了𩓐子那里，一滴滴的血水滴流來來。</p>
<p>於是整個酒店死一樣的靜默。人們沉在慘酷的回憶里了。在掌櫃的眼前，一個熟悉的主顧出現了，他在櫃台上丟了十二個銅板，說：</p>
<p>“劉掌櫃，來一吊四的白乾！”</p>
<p>他從不記賬，是一個鎮上最安分的農民，然而現在被鍘了頭，在他的眼前，又彷彿看見一具無頭的身屍暴在風雨里，給雨水泡腫了的身體上邊，有烏鴉在啄食着。掌櫃周身起了一陣痙攣，低聲自語着說：</p>
<p>“這是什麼世界呢；像金生這樣的人也會給鍘了，眞是……”</p>
<p>應着野狗的吠聲同着滴的淅瀝，遠處傳來一陣號啕的聲音。</p>
<p>四個喝酒的人猛然抬起頭來，側着耳朶聽着。</p>
<p>“是金生的媽呢！聽！”坐在癩痢頭旁邊的人說：</p>
<p>哭聲漸漸近了。凌亂的步子，脚子踏在水沼里的聲音突然傳來了：“我的金生！你們還我的金生！他犯了什麼罪？他犯了什麼罪？五雷轟死你們呀！天追你們呀！……呵…呵……救命呀！他們搶了我的金生呀……救…救…命………”</p>
<p>“她還不知道金生給鍘了呢？可憐的，實在太可……”掌櫃說着。</p>
<p>一個穿着黑短褂的婦人，踏着步，揮着手，正向鎮外跑去。像鴨子一樣嘶啞的聲音，不斷地有凝固了的空氣中盪漾着。</p>
<p>有如無家的鬼魂，她打裕興酒店的門口飄過去，頭髮披到她的胸前來。</p>
<p>雨下着，野犬吠着………</p>
<h3>光電池（電眼）的神奇（上）</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>一位少婦匆匆地走進一所公共大厦，對着一座飮料自來泉，尋覓一個開關器，或撳鈕，想喝點水止渴。相了半響，沒有看見，偶爾把頭一俯，那泉水便直噴上來，好像等着她似的。她便暗暗的稱奇。旁邊有一電梯侍役，對她微微笑着，也把頭向泉一俯，那水便也對他冒出。於是他便對那位少婦解釋道：“這是你的頭把光綫撞斷的原故。誰到這兒來喝水，只要這麼一來，那水便直冒上來，他們稱這個玩意為‘光電池’——Photoelectruc　cell</p>
<p>那緊壓的小小光電池，只有幾吋高，能自動的分別顏色；開汽車間的門；搶盜；滅火；似乎是很神奇的一件東西。新時代工業用的“阿拉定燈，”也是採用這個法兒。</p>
<p>天文學家用它測量和比較由星面傳到地求上的光。工廠主人用它報火警，防盜匪。偵探用它遏制強盜的活動。航空家用它在繫住的氣球上測定霧的高度，以保飛行的安全。運輸專家用它在郊外設立信號。</p>
<p>這種“電眼，”確然差不多已把人的智慧賦與機械。要看它怎麽預防囚犯從監牢裏逃走，倘若一個囚犯悄悄地爬出牆頭，便會立刻有裝在暗處的一枝手槍自動向他發彈，牆上的警鈴，也發聲報警。這是因為和獄牆平行的一端，有一道小光綫，常常照着另一端安置的光電池。那囚犯走進光電池視綫的距離以內，把光綫隔斷，於是電流停止，因此發生的衝動，會運用機電器，還能發出一道大光，或使機關槍砰砰發彈不止。</p>
<p>射在某種金屬物上或金屬氱化物上的光，會撞鬆電子，那電子便流過緊閉的電流輪道，這便是光綫池的原則，而只像一個乾殼果的大小。</p>
<p>光電池的歷史，跟研究光的力量和它的效果很接近。很可奇的一件事，在二千年前，便發見了射在一種物件上的光，只有一半返照，餘一半是被那物件吸收的。</p>
<p>新時代光電池的基本原則，是在一八八七年由德國物理學家赫資氏發明。他在試驗火星迸發的當兒，察覺一個火星的空隙，是受從另一空隙發出來的光的影響。</p>
<p>一八八九年愛爾特氏和蓋台爾氏二人專心研究把這種學理施於實用。二人鉆研了三十年之久，再會合阿姆斯特朗氏和蓋沙爾氏等的工作，成功了我們今日所有不可思議的奇器。</p>

<h3>趙慧深從“雷雨”到“馬路天使”</h3>
<p>這幾天，中國旅行劇團又將在再度準備上演曹禺先生的𪝪作“雷雨”了，過去，也曾排演過這一個劇本，演出的成績，卜得滬上人士以及各地愛好戲劇的觀衆們以無上的好評。這，當然不是偶然的事，劇本描寫的深刻，中旅演員演技的純熟，努力的苦幹所促成的，我們對着這一羣為中國劇運努力奮斗的藝人，只有無限欽敬！</p>
<p>我想凡是看過舞台上“雷雨”的觀衆們，一定會熟悉趙慧深這一個名字吧：她是中旅的台柱，是一個有着相當修養的女作家。在“雷雨”裹演一個後母—繁漪—深刻的表情，陰險的個性，把一個後母的典型，刻劃得淋漓盡緻，給觀衆們在腦海裹留下了不可磨滅的印象。確立了舞台上高貴光榮的評價。</p>
<p>現在，趙慧深女士經明星當局的一再商洽，在袁牧之導演的新作“馬路天使”裹擔任了一個要角。在劇中，牠是一個飽經滄桑。經盡艱苦的妓女，在深夜中，在寒風裹，牠每天晚上站立在路邊街頭，含着淚痕的媚笑，懷着希望的心，在招徠那過路的主顧，藉此獲得鴇母歡心，解决最低限度的飢寒。</p>
<p>這樣一個在社會重壓下度着非人生活的女子，牠的內心是如何地痛苦啊！這不是牠本身的自願吧？現實社會吃人的制度，逼着牠不得不向這非職業的職業屈服。</p>
<p>無疑的，以趙女士過去的成功，來飾演這個在人海裹掙扎求生的角色，是非常適合的，她冷靜沉着的表情，將會使“馬路天使”有更好的收獲。</p>
<h3>“泰山出險”</h3>
<p>南京大上海同時公映</p>
<p>泰山與觀衆久違，今日起在大上海及南京兩戲院中同時與滬上人士相見。片中奇形之怪獸無窮，米高梅公司於攝製時頗費心血。攝影者及演員等歷盡艱辛，深入莽秣，生命之幾遭危殆者數。片中老牌泰山約翰華斯摩勒與凶獅恶戰，與巨鱷力搏，與怪蝠爭抗，情形之緊張，備極驚心動魄。其如岸邊調情，水中艷浴等幕，較之以前之＂泰山情侶＂描寫更見透澈。助演者除老搭檔大明星瑪琳歐莎覽文外，另有蓓妮泰赫姆及威廉享利等大明星。</p>
<h3>“滿園春色”</h3>
<p>“滿園春色”為藝華影片公司又一鉅構，開拍已有數月，攝制均甚順利，技術十分優秀，定為一般愛好藝華出品諸君所樂聞，全劇共分五組，由五位導演分別擔任，茲將該片主要演員及導演者介紹如次：</p>
<p>袁美雲，馬陋芬主演，導演者王次龍；路明，王乃東主演，導演者陳鏗然；徐琴芳，梁篤生主演，導演者方沛霖；朱秋痕，王引主演，導演者徐蘇靈；周璇，關宏達主演，導演者岳楓；並有其他男女演員通力合作，人材濟濟，攝成了這一部“滿園春色”。</p>
<h3>明星昨日開幕</h3>
<p>由“明星”建筑築設計</p>
<p>喧傳已久重行改組之明星舞廳，業於昨日下午四時由上海名媛鄭倩兒小姐在樂隊演奏中華國歌聲中舉行剪彩開幕典禮，據聞此次自呼馬二君接手改組後，不遺餘力，將明星全部設備，大加改良，舞廳由明星影片公司建築師吳亞青君會同明星設計部改成最新時代型二圖輪流綫式，壁間染成淺水色彩，宛如“綠色”宮殿，舞妝由明星主人向各大舞塲情請聘到，樂隊則請大滬舞廳之杜綸名樂隊，日夜在塲伴奏，一切設施，可稱滬上小型舞塲之冠云。</p>

<h3>Mi Chunlin Passes Through Luoyang and Flies to Shaanxi</h3>
<p>To Further Convey the Central Government's Benevolent Intentions to Yang Yuhu</p>
<p>Intends to Return to Nanjing from Shaanxi Today to Report Back</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Meets with Gu Zhutong in Luoyang</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Government's handling of the Shaanxi situation continues to be based on the principle of cherishing national strength, hoping for the final repentance of Yang Hucheng and others. After Bao Wenwei, Mi Chunlin, and Li Zhigang, who conveyed the Central Government's benevolent intentions and reported their arrival from the south on the 17th, came to Nanjing, they were said to have been detained. On the 20th at noon, amidst rain and snow, they took a Eurasia special plane from Nanjing, stopped briefly in Zhengzhou, and flew directly to Xi'an to meet again with Yang Hucheng and others. They conveyed the intentions that had been requested from the Central Government for several days, urging them to immediately obey the Central Government's resettlement measures. Someone at the airport saw Mi Chunlin and others with smiles on their faces, suggesting that this trip might not be in vain. It is heard that Mr. Mi still plans to take a plane to Nanjing at 10:00 AM on the 21st to report back. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Bao Wenwei, Mi Chunlin, and Li Zhigang passed through Zhengzhou and flew to Xi'an. This trip is a crucial key to peace in the Shaanxi situation. New developments are expected within days. There were no major clashes on the front lines before the 20th. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] The Chairman of Henan Province, Shang Zhen, arrived in Luoyang this morning to inspect and visit various military leaders. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] According to road news, the situation between Huazhou and Chishui remains as before. Yesterday, it was reported that there was a small clash between sentries on both sides. It is estimated that it was patrol fire and there was no formal contact. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Shaanxi Students' Association in Nanjing sent a letter of advice to Yang Hucheng, urging him to accept the new appointment and take care of his hometown. Then there is room for discussion on all matters. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] According to sources, the Central Government's greatest desire regarding the Shaanxi-Gansu issue from the beginning was to resolve it politically. However, Yang Hucheng has shown no sincere intention of repentance. At the same time, a large part of the communist bandits have penetrated deep into Shaanxi territory. For the sake of the entire future of the country, the decision has been made to strictly enforce government orders. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Mi Chunlin, Bao Wenwei, Li Zhigang, and their party took a Eurasia giant plane and flew northwest at 12:20 PM on the 20th. It is heard that when passing through Luoyang, they planned to visit Director Gu Zhutong for some discussions before flying to Xi'an to further convey the Central Government's benevolent intentions to Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong, expecting their final awakening. They are scheduled to fly back south to report on the 21st. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Mi Chunlin, Bao Wenwei, Li Zhigang, and their party flew from Nanjing to Xi'an on a Eurasia plane at 3:00 PM on the 20th. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] The Chairman of Henan Province, Shang Zhen, arrived in Luoyang by special train from Kaifeng at 6:00 AM on the 20th. The Chief of Staff of Suiyuan, Liu Deyu, and the Administrative Commissioner, Wang Zemin, and others were all at the station to welcome him. The county flags of Luoyang City welcomed him. After arriving, Shang immediately got off the train and visited Director Liu and Director Gu separately. At noon, he hosted a banquet for the military leaders in Luoyang on the train. After the banquet, he went to the West Palace Military Branch School for talks. It is heard that Shang will stay in Luoyang for several days before returning to Kaifeng. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan The Central Government believes that the relationship between Shaanxi and Gansu provinces is extremely important to the national defense of the Northwest, and will certainly not allow the Red bandits to run rampant. In order to pacify the local bandits and consolidate the Northwest border defense, the National Army has a meticulous military deployment. In the future, whether the bandits flee south to Shaanxi and Gansu or cross the river north to Shanxi will be impossible. Their extermination by the National Army will certainly not be a problem. A part of Zhang's troops' generals have shown repentance. The Red bandits occupy Bao'an, Anding, Fushi, and Yanchang in northern Shaanxi, with Fushi as their base. A part of them went south to join Zhang Yang's troops, based in Weinan and Pucheng. The Red bandits are about to enter and exit Shangxian and Zhen'an in southern Shaanxi, attempting to disturb the border between Shaanxi and Henan. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Mi Chunlin, Bao Wenwei, Li Zhigang, and their entourage took off today and arrived in Nanjing at noon, then flew to Xi'an, arriving approximately tonight. According to reports, Mr. Mi and others' trip is a "final peace mission." After contacting Yang Hucheng, they will return to Nanjing tomorrow. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Suma Visits Zhang to Say Farewell</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] There is an external rumor that the Japanese Ambassador Kawagoe plans to enter Beijing early to meet with Foreign Minister Zhang. The relevant parties have not heard anything about it. There is currently no news of ongoing talks for the adjustment negotiations between China and Japan. The Japanese Consul General in Nanjing, Suma, is about to return to Japan. He attended Mayor Ma's banquet at noon on the 20th and visited Foreign Minister Zhang at 4:00 PM to say farewell, talking for about an hour. It is heard that Suma will not discuss official matters due to his departure. He did not respond to our protest against Japanese aircraft arbitrarily landing in Jinan and other issues. At 7:00 PM, Suma attended the banquet of Gao Zongwu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He is scheduled to leave Beijing for Shanghai on the morning of the 21st to wait for a ship back to Japan.

<h3>All Foreign Nationals in Xi'an Have Left the Country</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched Wang Guang to cooperate with personnel from the British and American embassies to handle the formalities for foreign nationals leaving Shaanxi, which has come to an end. A total of 75 people in the first batch and 6 people in the second batch have all passed through Luoyang and have been separately transferred to Tianjin, Beijing, Shanghai. Because three foreign nationals in Pingliang, Gansu have already left the country, Wang Guang will pass through Luoyang to Beiping and will have to wait in Luoyang before returning to Beijing to report. The Eurasia plane that went to Xi'an on the 19th returned to Nanjing with an empty plane at noon on the 20th because all the foreign nationals had left the country. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] 64 foreign nationals in Xi'an arrived in Zhengzhou on the morning of the 20th and were transferred to Shanghai, Wuhan, and Jinan. The Eurasia charter plane remained in Shaanxi, waiting to carry American nationals from Pingliang. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' telegram from Wang Guang, the handling of the departure of foreign nationals remaining in Shaanxi has been completed. It is planned to take the original plane back to report on the 21st. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] The foreign nationals in Xi'an arrived in Xuzhou this afternoon on a Longhai Railway passenger train, totaling 58 men, women, and children. 42 people were transferred to Shanghai by train, and the remaining 16 people took the evening train to Jinan. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] The American Consul in Wuhan telegraphed Luoyang on the 20th, notifying Bao Maoxun, the secretary of the American Embassy in Luoyang, and Wang Guang, the section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, that the three American nationals living in Pingliang had departed from Pingliang on the 19th to Hanzhong and would not come east for the time being. After Wang received the confirmation, he immediately notified the Eurasia plane that flew from Luoyang to Xi'an at noon on the 19th and the British and American military attachés, Chuan Ruize and Ba Ruide, to return to Luoyang quickly. It is heard that the plane will carry the three military attachés, Chuan Ruize, Si Kaotuo, and Ba Ruide, back east from Xi'an on the 21st. Wang will return to Beijing to report after the plane arrives. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Of the foreign nationals living in Shaanxi and Gansu who were rescued and came east, 71 people in the first batch got off the train in Luoyang, 13 people, and 58 people arrived in Xuzhou at noon on the 20th. Lupu Road prepared a second-class carriage, and 35 men and women, as well as three young children, went south that noon. Another 14 people, as well as two young children, went north to Jinan that evening. According to one foreign national, there is still a group of injured people in Shaanxi and Gansu who have arrived in Xi'an, waiting for a plane to come east. We left Xi'an at noon on the 18th, taking eight cars to Tongguan and changing to the Longhai train to arrive here. Many of the Red bandits who arrived in the provincial capital were in plain clothes. It is heard that Xu Xiangqian, Xu Haidong, Mao Zedong, and Peng Dehuai have arrived in Xi'an and met with Yang Hucheng and Zhang's generals. Most of the Red bandits are still gathered in Sanyuan, Jingyang, and the northern bank of the Wei River, supplied by Yang Hucheng. Wherever the bandit troops go, they wantonly disturb the area, especially by arresting landlords and gentry and extorting them in every possible way, which is resented by the people of Shaanxi. Yang Hucheng is quite responsible for the protection of foreign nationals. When we left Shaanxi, the atmosphere of war was extremely strong, but the Chishui front line had not yet officially clashed, with only sentry battles occurring at night. The people of Shaanxi believe that the Red bandits are active and Yang's troops are completely paralyzed, and the provincial capital is full of terror. They hope that the Central Army will quell the rebellion as soon as possible. Most of this group of foreign nationals are missionaries, and the rest are engineers and businessmen. When leaving Shaanxi, they were only allowed to carry light luggage. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The military attachés will do their best to persuade these people. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Publishes a Letter to Comrades in Hebei and Chahar</h3>
<p>Upholding National Unity and Implementing Central Government Orders</p>
<p>[Beiping] Song Zheyuan published a letter to comrades in Hebei and Chahar, with the following key points: ① Uphold national unity and implement Central Government orders. Pledge to achieve political rejuvenation through self-reliance and strength. ② The essential elements of a country are sovereignty, land, and people, which are the military's natural duty to protect. ③ Communism is inherently unsuitable for China and has long been recognized by enlightened people. I have repeatedly refuted Marx's theory of surplus value. The bandits are using this name to incite the masses, incite class struggle, and achieve their purpose of plundering rights. In fact, killing and arson are purely bandit actions, and they do not know what doctrine is. They only endanger the foundation of the country and slaughter the lives of the people. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Beiping] Song Zheyuan believes that the country is in dire straits, and today, the Political Council and the Pacification Office jointly issued four orders to the military and political organs under their jurisdiction, ordering them to resolutely implement them: 1. Do not participate in civil wars. 2. Anyone who invades our territory and insults our personality is an enemy and must be fought. 3. Bandits and communists who disrupt social order should be punished by everyone. 4. Suppressing bandits should not be regarded as a civil war, and suppressing communists should not be regarded as a civil war. They should be thoroughly eliminated to ensure social stability.

<h3>Bandits and Puppet Troops Set Up Barbed Wire Fences in Nanchaoqian</h3>

<p>[Guihua] Xinghe News: Bandits and puppets have set up a barbed wire fence 200 steps outside Nanchaoqian City, more than 4 feet high, starting from Xipengzi and ending at the South Shahu River, more than 20 feet long. In addition, seven companies of a certain party's troops are stationed in the East Beach of Nanchaoqian, with about 500 to 600 people. Zhang Wanqing's bandit troops, about 2,000, are stationed in the West Beach. Traffic is cut off every night from 7:00 PM, and both sides are heavily guarded, with a strong possibility of a clash. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guihua] Division Commander Sun Changsheng said that the bandits and puppets feint to the east and attack the west, plotting to disturb Sui North. The National Army has long been aware of this and has made considerable preparations. The bandits have absolutely no chance to succeed. Although there are small groups of bandits harassing the eastern border of Sui from time to time, it is not a concern. The actual number of bandits and puppets in northern Chahar is still no more than 20,000. A certain party recently sent personnel to the Shangdu North Reclamation Point to inspect Wang Ying's bandit troops. Because Wang had too few people, he temporarily pulled 400 to 500 farmers to make up the numbers. Their outwardly strong but inwardly weak situation can be imagined. (20th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guihua] In the past two days, the east of Sui has gradually become peaceful again. The Sui North project has been completed, and Fu Zuoyi has sent a special commissioner to inspect it.

The bandit army was repeatedly attacked by Da Miling Su Long's troops recently. In order to retaliate, they fled to Liujia Gully near the Twelve Sumu to harass the area. They have been completely repelled by our army in recent days. Recently, small groups within the bandit army have fled to our side from time to time. A certain party sent a large number of planes to pursue and bomb them. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Smuggling by Ronin on the Jinpu Railway is Rampant Again</h3>
<p>Buying Tickets According to Regulations and Luggage Does Not Exceed the Limit Li Xingzheng Connects with All Parties to Suppress Smuggling</p>
<p>[Tianjin] The smuggling by ronin on the Jinpu Railway has recently become rampant again. This matter began a week ago. Ronin form groups, each with 30 to 40 people, disguised as passengers, wrapping artificial silk, seafood, sugar, foreign cloth, and other items into luggage, each roll weighing about 60 kilograms, and taking the Jinpu passenger train south, getting off at Cangzhou, Botouzhen, or Jiyan and selling them to major cities and towns in Hebei and Shandong at extremely low prices. Although the customs and railways are aware of this, because the ronin all carry weapons and buy tickets to ride the train, and the weight of their luggage does not exceed the regulations, they cannot be inspected and detained, resulting in the three-class passenger trains traveling south on the Jinpu Railway being extremely crowded every day. The newly appointed Director of the Railway Anti-Smuggling General Inspection Office, Li Xing, is connecting with all parties to discuss anti-smuggling methods, but there has been no result. Customs estimates that the smuggling will be rampant in the two weeks before and after the abolition of the year, and may be more severe than last summer. (20th Dispatch)</p>

The ship was equipped with safety measures to prevent accidents, and the hole would not have been a major problem, but the 300+ passengers on board panicked excessively, order was lost, and the ship capsized. All 300+ passengers on board drowned. The "Mofan" ferry, which was being towed by the "Minzu," turned around to provide assistance, and nearby boats also risked coming to help, but due to the turbulent waters of the shoal, only over 100 people were rescued.

<h3>The Franco-Turkish Dispute in the League of Nations Council Meeting</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The first regular meeting of the League of Nations Council this year is scheduled to open today in Geneva. Attending are the foreign ministers of Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, Poland, and other countries. Mr. Gu Weijun, the representative of our country, will serve as chairman. Important issues on the agenda include the Free City of Danzig problem, the Franco-Turkish dispute over the minority issue in Syria, and the refugee relief issue in the Spanish Civil War. Among these, the most important is the dispute between France and Turkey over their colonial territories in the East.</p>
<p>France and Turkey have historically had very friendly relations. This dispute arises from the jurisdiction over the areas of Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria. These two areas are important regions in the northwestern corner of Syria near the coast. Before the war, they belonged to Turkey. After the war, they were incorporated into Syria and became French mandated territories. However, the residents of Alexandria and Antioch are mostly Turks. Therefore, Article 7 of the 1921 Ankara Treaty stipulated that "the Alexandretta region shall be governed by a special administrative system. Turkish residents in the region shall enjoy all facilities to develop their national culture. Turkish shall be considered an official language." Similar statements were made later in the 1926 Luvenel Agreement. If these treaty obligations could be faithfully implemented, disputes between the two countries would not arise. However, according to the Turkish government, France has not faithfully fulfilled these treaty obligations and has often treated the Turkish minority in the Alexandria and Antioch areas unfairly. Therefore, Turkey is now demanding that France return these two cities to Turkey or establish them as independent regions. However, from the French perspective, the reasons put forward by the Turkish government are merely a pretext to reclaim old territories. France believes that out of the 219,000 residents in the Alexandria and Antioch areas, only 85,000 are Turks, accounting for 30% of the total population. The majority of residents are Arabs and other ethnic groups. France also cites facts to show that they have not discriminated against the Turks. For example, Turks occupy 13 of the 23 mayoral positions, while Arabs occupy only 10. Turks also occupy a majority in the administrative organs of the region. For example, the ministers of public works, agriculture, education, and health are all Turks. Arabs only hold the position of Minister of Finance.</p>
<p>The opinions of both France and Turkey mentioned above have considerable justification. However, the reason why this issue has recently become serious is not because France has discriminated against the Turkish minority in the Alexandria and Antioch region, but because of the changes in the situation in the Near East. There are two phenomena in the changing situation in the Near East. First, France signed treaties with its two mandated territories, Syria and Lebanon, last year, allowing them to become independent and planning to introduce them to the League of Nations. As a result, Turkey wants to take the opportunity to reclaim the Alexandria and Antioch regions or make them an independent organization not subject to the rule of an independent Syria. Second, Turkey's foreign policy has recently shifted from passive to active. In the past ten years, Turkey has been devoted to construction, working hard to become strong, and its national power has greatly increased. Therefore, it has recently been thinking about expanding outwards to reclaim territories lost after the war. For example, last year it restored the fortifications in the Dardanelles region. The recent demand to France to reclaim the Alexandria and Antioch regions is also a manifestation of this active foreign policy.</p>
<p>The discussion of the Franco-Turkish issue at this Council meeting is because the Turkish government filed a complaint with the Council last year. The Council resolved to send a three-person investigation committee to the Near East to conduct an on-site investigation. The report will be presented at this meeting for detailed discussion. Although we cannot yet predict how this issue will be resolved, given the close relationship between France and Turkey in the past, both sides will certainly make considerable concessions to achieve a satisfactory resolution.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Sworn in to Defend the Constitution</h3>
<p>Unjust Blemishes Will Be Eliminated as Much as Possible; 300,000 People Participate in the Ceremony</p>
<p>[Washington] In his speech upon taking office for his second term as president today, Roosevelt declared his determination to eliminate "unjust blemishes," which make America feel lacking in the midst of abundance, and to make every American citizen a citizen who shares the joys and sorrows of their country.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt, who has just solemnly sworn to defend the Constitution, gave a broad interpretation of the powers of the Constitution in his speech. He said, "Our ancestors built a sound government with the power of united action. From that day to this, all difficult problems that individuals and localities cannot solve can be solved easily. They established the federal government to promote the happiness of the people and to obtain the enjoyment of freedom for the American people. Today, we must still appeal to the power of this government to achieve the same goal. The Constitution of 1787 did not diminish our democratic spirit in the slightest." Roosevelt continued, "The progress of the restoration is extremely obvious, but the significance of the new systems created in all aspects since 1933 is more than that. "Now, with new materials used in social justice, we are engaged in building a more lasting structure on the old foundation for the better use of future generations." Roosevelt also said, "Now there is one thing that runs counter to our American democracy, that is, today there are tens of millions of citizens who are still denied most of the minimum standards needed for their current lives. It must be known that the test of our progress is not whether we have made those who are already rich even richer, but whether we can satisfy those who enjoy too little." The President's concluding remarks were: "If I can fully understand the spirit and purpose of our country, we will certainly not value enjoyment, speculation, and cowardice. We must move forward. I now swear again as President, taking on the solemn obligation to lead the American people forward on the path they have chosen." (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The crowd gathered in front of the Capitol today to watch President Roosevelt's inauguration ceremony for his second term reached 50,000 people. It rained heavily, and everyone was soaked. Although the sky was dark, the weather was slightly milder than usual, and the people's enthusiasm was not diminished in the slightest. The number of people who came to the capital specifically to watch the event reached more than 300,000. The military parade was quite long. President Roosevelt watched them pass by the observation platform specially built outside the White House. The military flags fluttered, and the sound of military music filled the air. The observation platform was built in the style of the home of President Jackson, the seventh president, who was also a Democrat and was also re-elected. President Roosevelt stood in a space surrounded by glass. Participants in today's ceremony were limited to representatives of civil servants and the military. The first team was one representative from each military unit and each officer training school in the country. The order was determined by the order in which each state passed the US Constitution, led by Postmaster General Farley, who was a strongman in this Democratic campaign. President Roosevelt's re-election was due to his great efforts. The second team was all military personnel from the Navy and the Army. Four hundred members of the civilian land conservation corps, all in uniform, carrying hoes, shovels, axes, etc., also participated. Hotels and boarding houses in Washington were all full. The overnight fee for a single room in a large hotel was at least ten US dollars, so each hotel's profits tripled. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>US Fleet Commander Visits Singapore</h3>
<p>Not Without Political Significance; Symbol of Friendship Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[Singapore] US Fleet Commander in Asia, General Shanar, told reporters here yesterday that the US fleet in Asia will visit the British $50 million USD naval port in the Far East from time to time in the future. In addition to the flagship leading the destroyer fleet on an annual visit, other warships will also come frequently and independently. It is hoped that the British fleet will also visit US naval ports from time to time, which will be a "symbol of friendship between the United States and the United Kingdom." Singapore newspapers believe that the US fleet's emphasis on the British naval port is not without considerable political significance, but US Consul General in Singapore, Davis, said that the US fleet's visit to Singapore has no other political effect other than expressing "goodwill."

<h3>Japanese Parliament Reopens Today</h3>
<p>The Two Major Parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, Have No Determination to Overthrow the Cabinet; The Huge Budget Will Become a Fierce Point of Contention</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese parliament will reopen tomorrow, and the political atmosphere here is extremely tense. Each political party held a conference today to express its attitude. Among them, the attitudes of the two major parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, are particularly noteworthy. The Minseito Party, which represents the largest party in the House of Representatives, declared that it has no determination to overthrow the cabinet. The moderate wording of the declaration shows that it is dyed with the colors of the ruling party, even more so than the Showakai. The Seiyukai's declaration lists various failures of the government, but in the conclusion, it expresses very little power to fundamentally change the current cabinet situation, limiting itself to impeaching the government. The Social Mass Party's declaration is clearly different from the declarations of the two government parties, strongly stating the need to overthrow the Hirota cabinet. Its position on domestic and foreign policies is clearly expressed, which seems to attract attention from all parties. The National Alliance and the East Association also advocate overthrowing the Hirota cabinet, but the reasons for their arguments are very different from those of the Social Mass Party, and their influence is far less than that of the Social Mass Party. Observing the atmosphere on the eve of the reopening of the parliament today, the current cabinet, although facing many obstacles, can still overcome the difficulties and continue to exist because the two major parties, Seiyukai and Minseito, did not advocate overthrowing the cabinet. However, the important key lies in whether the tax increase plan will be changed, and the diplomatic issue is secondary. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Today's Parliamentary Procedure</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The parliamentary procedure for the 21st is as follows: The House of Peers will convene at 10 AM, beginning with Prime Minister Hirota's speech on the government's policy, followed by Foreign Minister Arita's speech on foreign policy. Then, it will proceed to the question-and-answer session for the speeches of the Ministers of State. Watanabe, Sakatani, and others will raise questions. Then, the bill to amend the Commercial Code will be submitted. The House of Representatives will convene at 1 PM. After the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister give the same speeches, Minister of Finance Maba will deliver a speech on financial policy. Sakanouchi Yukio of the Minseito Party will be the first to launch the question-and-answer session. (Allied Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Government Faces Many Difficulties</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] The parliamentary recess period has ended and will reopen tomorrow to formally discuss various important government affairs. The government continued to hold cabinet meetings on the 18th and 19th, deciding on the content of the speeches of Prime Minister Hirota, Foreign Minister Arita, and Finance Minister Maba in the parliament, and several dozen important bills will be submitted by the government at the beginning. The various factions of the House of Representatives also held meetings on the 20th to decide on the final policy for dealing with the parliament. This parliament is the first ordinary parliament after the establishment of the Hirota cabinet. In addition to the large budget of 3.04 billion yuan, there are also important cases such as tax increases, diplomacy, electricity, and compulsory education, which are bound to involve overlapping waves and complex subtleties, so its progress is particularly noteworthy. Moreover, various political parties have expressed opposition to the government's foreign policy, and due to high prices and public unrest, a part of the normal sector has even demanded a review of the budget. Therefore, after the parliament reopens, there will definitely be a tense scene. The Japanese people are all paying attention to its development. (Allied Press dispatch from the 20th)</p>
<h3>Division of Forces among Factions</h3>
<p>According to our newspaper's survey on the 20th, the distribution of power among the various factions in the parliament is as follows: 162 members in the House of Peers affiliated with the Research Society, 67 with the Justice Society, 41 with the Huoyao Society, 34 with the Friendship Club, 34 with the Tonghe Society, 22 with the Tongcheng Society, 32 Independents, and 18 members of the Imperial Family. In the House of Representatives, there are 205 members of the Minseitō (Democratic Constitutional Party), 172 of the Seiyūkai (Friends of Constitutional Government), 25 of the Shōwakai, 20 of the First Control Room, 18 of the Social Masses Party, 2 of the Proletarian Party, 19 of the Second Control Room, 5 affiliated with the Tenth Group, 14 Independents, 12 with the National League, 9 with the Eastern Society, and 4 pure Independents, totaling 466.</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Uncovers Another Major Counter-Revolutionary Conspiracy</h3>
<p>Trotskyite "Parallel Center" Military Tribunal Scheduled to Hear Case on the 23rd</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Public Prosecutor's Office recently issued a public announcement stating that the organs of the People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs have completed the investigation of the Trotskyite "Parallel Center" case. The "Parallel Center" case involves Piatakov, Radek, Sokolnikov, and Serebriakov, who, in 1933, following the orders of Trotsky, who was exiled abroad, formed the group along with the Trotskyite Center of Zinoviev, Kamenev, Smirnov, and Mrachkovsky. The investigation has proved that the "Parallel Center" was ordered by Trotsky to organize sabotage and terrorist groups. These groups carried out sabotage in various enterprises, especially those with national defense significance, and prepared to use terrorist means against the leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet government. These groups were also ordered by Trotsky and the "Parallel Center" to carry out espionage work on behalf of certain countries. The investigation proved that the criminal activities of the "Parallel Center" and the Trotskyite organ party members charged in this case were aimed at destroying the Soviet military strength, promoting armed aggression against the Soviet Union, assisting foreign aggressors in occupying Soviet territory, dividing the Soviet Union, overthrowing the Soviet regime, and restoring capitalism and the rule of the bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union. Defendants Piatakov, Radek, Sokolnikov, Serebriakov, Muralov, Livshitz, Drobnis, Boguslavsky, Knyazev, Rataichak, Norkin, Hestov, Stroilov, Turok, Grashi, Pushin, and Arnold are proven to have committed crimes, and they have all been publicly prosecuted.

<h3>Italy and Germany Firmly Cooperate to Prevent the Reddening of Central Europe</h3>
<p>Opposing the Establishment of Soviet Political Systems in Western Countries Willing to Pay Any Price in the Face of Crisis</p>
<p>Capri Island General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation, declared here today, "Italy and Germany have decided to oppose the rise of communism in Central Europe and Spain. The threat of reddening has reached a serious stage in Spain. Italy and Germany cannot allow communists to gain a foothold in Central Europe. Therefore, we will resolutely oppose any development that increases this kind of red disaster with all our strength." (National News Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, General Göring issued a statement to the newspapers, saying that Italy and Germany are determined to oppose the establishment of Bolshevism in Spain, regardless of the cost. Göring also stated that Italy and Germany have consistent ideas and opinions, and the systems of authority and command are also the same. The two countries have recognized that they should firmly cooperate to overcome the great danger of the spread of Bolshevism in the world. This danger has reached the most acute level, so the two countries have decided to oppose any development that increases the danger with all their strength. As for the rumors that the Italian government had tried to persuade Germany not to insist on its policy towards Spain, it is completely unfounded. Göring ended by saying that the warmth of the welcome he received in Italy shows that the Italians have not forgotten the friendly assistance Germany gave during the East African war. (Reuter, 19th)</p>
<p>Naples, Italy After General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation, went to the nearby island of Capri the other day, Crown Prince Umberto of Italy also took the destroyer "Valreno" to the island to accompany Göring for a day. General Göring has now decided to stay on the island until Friday of this week, presumably to meet with Mussolini once more before returning home. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Eden's Speech on the Diplomatic Situation</h3>
<p>Strongly Advocating the Policy of Non-Intervention in Spain Hoping that Countries Will Cooperate to Seek Peace in Europe</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden said in a speech in the House of Commons today that 1937 is expected to be a difficult year for international problems, but he said that this year will also be a year when international opportunities come. Eden solemnly stated that Britain may be invited to do more in world affairs this year, so Britain has a great responsibility.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary stated that in recent years, diplomatic affairs have occupied a large position when the government usually holds meetings with the parliament. This is due to the ordinary people's desire and worry for peace. Unfortunately, this phenomenon has not yet been universal. He does not mean that the desire for peace of certain people is not as eager as that of Britain. He only says that because of the lack of complete freedom to express opinions and communicate with each other in various places, world public opinion has not been able to exert its full strength on peace. This is a situation that Britain regrets, because Britain deeply feels that the number of people in the world who desire peace is very large. If all the barriers set up for freedom of communication and freedom of speech are destroyed everywhere, then the threat to peace that exists today can be greatly reduced. The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the civil war in Spain, saying that the current situation in Spain has made all other affairs in the international arena pale in comparison. Although the danger that the Spanish civil war may plunge Europe into a whirlpool of war has not been completely eliminated, this danger has indeed been limited. If anyone believes that the result of the Spanish civil war will be that any foreign power or powers will rule Spain for thirty years, that is, manage its way of life and guide its diplomatic policy, he believes that this person is completely wrong. Of all the results, this is the least likely to be realized. (Cheers from the crowd) Britain certainly opposes this kind of encounter. This is not only opposed by Britain. All 24 million Spaniards also oppose it. Now the only event that can unite Spain is the common disgust for foreigners. The magnanimous Spaniards will have the slightest sense of disgust for the countries that interfere in Spanish affairs. The act of interference will eventually be bad humanity, not only this, but also bad policy. Britain and Spain certainly have interests, but it is not Britain's concern what kind of special political system Spain should have, whether it is right-leaning or left-leaning, because if Britain has a position on this kind of event, it will fall into a war of conflicting ideas, which is what Britain deeply hates. Therefore, Britain has always opposed foreign interference and will continue to maintain this aspiration in the future.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary stopped his debate at this point in order to clarify the "matter concerning the principle of non-interference" that had been raised during the question time in the House of Commons. The Foreign Secretary solemnly stated, "There is not a single word, not a single line, not a single point in the Anglo-Italian Joint Declaration that can give any foreign country the right to interfere in Spanish affairs, no matter what form the government of any part of the country takes."</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then continued the debate, saying that Britain is concerned about two things in the Spanish war: ㊀ The war must not spread outside of Spain, ㊁ The political independence and territorial integrity of Spain should be maintained. Therefore, non-interference in the Spanish civil war will still be the correct policy for Europe to pursue. The Foreign Secretary then brought up the issue of volunteer soldiers, and traced back to the British government's efforts to conduct an agreement since Christmas Eve, so that foreign people can be prohibited from joining the Spanish combat groups on both sides, and said that the failure to put forward this issue earlier is the reason why certain powers have this kind of dispatch of volunteer soldiers.</p>
<p>When the Foreign Secretary mentioned the French government's bill prohibiting its volunteer soldiers from leaving the country and joining the Spanish war, he said that if all countries' governments can do this, then they can approach a compromise, and it will certainly not be like the conflict of opinions today.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary answered because the communist member of parliament, Mr. Greig, had raised the issue of Spain recruiting soldiers in the United Kingdom, so he said that anyone who is recruited to go to Spain, their purpose is purely for money, not to agree with their doctrine. It can be clearly understood from the situation of a certain British recruit recently, because according to this person's claim, Spain hired him as an aircraft pilot, with a weekly salary of forty pounds and all expenses paid, in addition, if he can shoot down an enemy aircraft, he will be given a bonus of five hundred pounds.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also cited the example of a certain unemployed miner, saying that this person was induced to go to Spain when he was drunk, but because he woke up in the middle of the journey, he escaped from the ship and returned to his country.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also mentioned the humanitarian efforts in Spain, saying that both the Spanish government and the Nationalist army should be held responsible for the failure of the negotiations for the exchange of a large number of prisoners.</p>
<p>Regarding the status of Morocco, the Foreign Secretary declared that the reports received from the British Consul-General in the area are all comforting. In addition, the British government has also received reports on the investigation of Hòa Tǎ and Mí Lǐ Lā'ěr area, knowing that there is no evidence that German troops have landed or are preparing to land in these two places. The Foreign Secretary also assured the House of Commons that the government will continue to pay close attention to the situation in Morocco.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also said that the British government hopes and deeply believes that after the establishment of the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Declaration, the tense relations between the two countries will come to an end. However, the establishment of the above declaration does not mean that the British government's policy has changed, or that the British side has made any concessions, and there is no change to any of Britain's existing friendships. Its only function is to greatly help stabilize the situation in the Mediterranean. The Foreign Secretary also said that the French Foreign Minister, Delbos, expressed great welcome to the Anglo-Italian Mediterranean Declaration. Turkey, Yugoslavia, Greece and Egypt have also expressed their approval.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also stated that the government has seen that the reorganization of various military preparations is the only necessary method to achieve their goals. The so-called goal is to negotiate a pan-European solution and consolidate the authority of the League of Nations. The Foreign Secretary said that political appeasement and economic cooperation, if they are to succeed, must rely on the concerted efforts of all parties. If this can be achieved, then we will be able to create a better, healthier, and more prosperous Europe in a peaceful world. But to achieve this goal, we must reduce military expenditures and learn economic cooperation methods so that living standards can be improved.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then mentioned Germany, saying that people around the world are now asking where will racism and nationalism lead Germany and all of us? If Europe continues to float towards an increasingly vague future, and if it continues to be torn into pieces by national adversarial factions and very different thinkers, then its hope of survival will be very slim, and its trauma will not be healed by several generations. Germany has the power to choose in deciding the fate of its country and all of Europe. If it chooses the path of full and equal cooperation with Europe, then no one in Britain will do their best to help eliminate misunderstandings and pave the way to peace and prosperity. But merely empty talk and local remedies can heal the pain we are currently feeling. This kind of fantasy is of no benefit. Therefore, any country that cooperates with other countries and abandons the attempt to interfere in the affairs of other countries must not have any thought of evasion and retreat.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary concluded his speech by saying that the world cannot be ruled by conventions, agreements, and noble speeches. The way to cure is to abandon national monopolism, accept the European countries as legitimate partners in the overall solution of Europe, reduce military preparations to the extent necessary for national defense, accept the League of Nations as the international body to resolve all cases, and move towards the path of cooperation together. Only then will there be hope for peace. (Reuter, 19th)</p>

There are a total of sixteen member states of the Council. At this meeting, only Italy did not send a representative to attend. In addition, nine of the fifteen countries belonging to Europe are attended by the foreign ministers in person, namely British Foreign Secretary Eden, French Foreign Minister Delbos, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, Swedish Foreign Minister Sandler, Romanian Foreign Minister Antonescu, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüștü, Polish Foreign Minister Beck, Spanish Foreign Minister Del Vayo, and Latvian Foreign Minister Munters. Portugal in Europe, Chile, Bolivia, and Ecuador in the Americas, and New Zealand in Australia have also sent representatives to attend. In addition, Ecuador has not sent a representative to participate in the Council meeting since last September. This time, it specially sent its Consul-General in Geneva, Mr. Ruesdro, to attend as a representative, because the Chilean government has initiated the relief of refugees from various countries' embassies in Madrid, which will be discussed by the Council at this meeting. Ecuador sent a representative to attend to support Chile's proposal in order to express the solidarity of the American countries. (Havas, 20th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Council of the League of Nations will meet tomorrow. According to the Petit Parisien, the Council will appoint a committee to study the issue of re-distributing raw materials, and the Polish representative, Colonel Beck, the country's foreign minister, will also request that the German Foreign Minister Neurath send someone to participate in this committee. "In addition, the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, has unofficially requested a few days ago that the United States, Japan, and Brazil (all non-League members) cooperate with the committee. It is generally believed that these countries have expressed their acceptance in principle regarding this request." (Havas, 20th)</p>
<h3>Quasi-Wartime System Japan's Trade Deficit</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The trade in the middle of this month shows a deficit of 69 million yuan. The main reason for this is the sharp increase in cotton imports, with a quantity of 1.15 million piculs, valued at 70 million yuan, which is twice the normal amount. It is believed that the strengthening of exchange control has led to this reckless import. Other military raw materials such as crude oil, heavy oil, machinery, and pig iron have also shown a significant increase. In addition, the import quantity of miscellaneous goods has also increased by 15 million yuan. This is a phenomenon that should exist in the compilation of the so-called quasi-wartime system. However, other aspects of exports are normal, and the continuity of this trend is extremely noteworthy. (Domei News Agency, 20th)</p>

<h3>Overview of the Puppet Organizations in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>The Puppet Meng Government is the Highest Political Institution A certain party also established a special affairs agency in Zhangbei</p>
<p>Zhangbei Correspondence Recently, Prince De once changed the name of the Huade Administrative Bureau in Jiabusi to Dehua, and now it has been changed back to Dehua City, with Prince De concurrently serving as the puppet mayor. The puppet municipal government is located in Prince De's palace. As for the former Zhangbei puppet Meng government, its internal organization has also undergone major changes and has been renamed the puppet "Meng Government Office". There is also a so-called Chahar Province Supreme Special Affairs Agency, in which certain people are in key positions, overseeing all military and political powers in Chahar Province. The following is a detailed description of its organizational structure and the situation of various bandit and puppet troops in Chahar Province.</p>
<p>Overview of the Organizational Structure of the Puppet Meng Government The Zhangbei Puppet Meng Government Office is a product of the former puppet Meng government and is now the highest puppet administrative institution in Chahar Province. Its internal organization is divided into three departments: Security, Finance, and General Affairs, and three sections: Han, Mongolian, and Manchu. Each department has several advisors from a certain party, totaling more than 30 people, and there is also a chief advisor, who is also from a certain party. The head of the puppet Meng government is Zhuote Bazhapu. The address of the puppet Meng Government Office is in Zhangbei County Government Street. In addition, the organization of the government offices in each county is also divided into three sections: General Affairs, Finance, and Security, and a search office is set up. The puppet directors of each county are all from a certain party, searching people's homes from time to time, day and night, which is very disturbing to the people. Each puppet county government has one advisor from a certain party, and each security section also has one guidance officer from a certain party.</p>
<p>Overview of the Organizational Structure of the Special Affairs Agency There is also the so-called Chahar Province Supreme Special Affairs Agency, which is a disguised form of a certain party's military department, located in the southeastern corner of Zhangbei County. Tanaka is the head of the special affairs agency, with about 30 subordinates, only three of whom are Chinese. Its task is to specialize in spying on the military and political situation in various places and collecting secret intelligence. Currently, there are personnel from this agency active in Suiyuan, Chahar, and other provinces. In addition, the troops in the Mongolian areas are directly under its command. As for the counties, political special affairs agencies have also been set up. Under this situation, all military and political powers in Chahar Province are in the hands of a certain party.</p>
<p>Prince De Purchases Vehicles and Orders Military Uniforms Prince De is currently in Jiabusi (Dehua City). Because the military transportation of various troops in Chahar Province has been heavy recently, the existing transportation vehicles are not enough. He specially sent his puppet director Zhang Jicheng to Beiping on the 17th to order 20 heavy-duty trucks, and instructed Zhang that after the trucks are ordered, he can collect the vehicle price from a certain party (stationed in Beiping). He also sent Li, the former director of the Finance Bureau of Bailingmiao, to Tianjin Huachang Military Clothing Shop to order 20,000 sets of cotton military uniforms and 17,000 pairs of horse boots. It is said that Li arrived in Kou on the 17th and has already contacted the manager of the shop to proceed. He also sent Yu, the manager of the Dehua store, to Kou to purchase a large number of military supplies, preparing very actively.</p>
<p>Wang Ying Requests Military Expenses for Expansion Wang Ying returned to Shangdu from Tunken Village on the 15th and plans to go to Jiabusi again within a few days to meet with the head of a certain special affairs agency to request military expenses in order to carry out expansion. On the 17th, more than 60 puppet soldiers newly recruited by Wang's troops from Yi County arrived in Kou. It is said that they can open to Shangdu via Zhangbei on the 18th. More than 300 troops of Xiong Erdu, the puppet 6th Division of Prince De's troops, also arrived in the west of Shangdu from Xisumente Banner on the 16th. As for the puppet troops that opened from Nanhongqian, the total number has now exceeded 2,000.</p>
<h3>This Year's Labor Service in Beijing Begins Implementation</h3>
<p>Divided into Urban and Rural Areas for Implementation; This Year's Project Scope is More Significant Than Before</p>
<p>Nanjing Communication: Under the leadership of Mayor Ma, the National Labor Service in Beijing has achieved excellent results in recent years. Yesterday, the Director of the Public Works Bureau, Song Xishang, reported the preparations in great detail at the weekly meeting of the Municipal Government. Regarding the situation in the 24th year, according to Song's report, after receiving the telegram from Chairman Chiang, the city immediately began to organize national labor service in the 24th year, focusing on water conservancy and afforestation. Soldiers and civilian workers were recruited to build flood control dikes along the river. More than 4,000 soldiers and more than 3,000 civilian workers participated, building more than 31 kilometers of earthen dikes and planting tens of thousands of trees.</p>
<p>The National Labor Service project for the winter of the 25th year has also begun and is now implementing the recruitment of workers. It was originally scheduled to start construction in Shangxinhe in the rural area on the 19th. On the 20th and 21st, Xiaolingwei and Yanziji districts successively started construction, engaging in building dikes and deepening reservoirs and ponds. In the urban area, the Qin Huai River from Tiechuangnu to Sixiang Bridge will be dredged, scheduled to start on February 1st. Later, the district chiefs in the rural areas requested a postponement of one week due to continuous rain and snow, which made construction difficult. Therefore, the Shangxinhe district was rescheduled to start on the 25th, the Xiaolingwei district on the 26th, and the Yanziji district on the 27th, all holding opening ceremonies at 9 am on their respective scheduled dates. Mayor Ma Chaojun, Director of the Public Works Bureau Song Xishang, and others will all attend. Regarding the preparations for this year's National Labor Service, the following is a record of Song Xishang's report: Firstly, the National Labor Service to be undertaken in the 25th year, its engineering plan, is divided into urban and rural areas for implementation. (A) In the urban area, the task is to dredge the Qin Huai River. Because the Qin Huai River has been neglected for many years, it is silted up, dirty, and smelly, causing great harm. Dredging cannot be delayed. We will first select the most silted section from Sixiang Bridge to Tiechuangling, which is more than 2 kilometers and 300 meters long, with approximately 19,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Calculating three laborers per cubic meter, approximately 98,000 laborers are needed. In addition, three sections, namely Taiping Bridge to Ganheyan, Huaiqing Bridge to Lishe Bridge, and Zhu Bridge, will be selected and dredged in sequence, totaling approximately 30,000 laborers. However, the riverside residences are densely packed, the slope is very steep, and there is very little open space, making it very difficult to remove, pile, and transport the excavated earth. Furthermore, the draftees have no relevant experience in taking earth from the river. At the same time, although the original accumulated water will be pumped out during construction, underground water will continue to flow, making drainage a major problem. These difficulties are currently being resolved with all efforts. (B) In the rural area: ㊀ In the Shangxinhe district, the task is to build the North Bank dike, which is the unfinished part of the previous National Labor Service, approximately 9 kilometers weak, with approximately 75,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Calculating one laborer per cubic meter, approximately 75,000 laborers are needed. ㊁ In the Yanziji district, based on the urgent needs of the district, the task is to excavate 5 kilometers of ditches, 60 reservoirs and ponds, build 2 roads, and repair approximately 17 kilometers of dikes. ㊂ In the Xiaolingwei district, based on the urgent needs of the district, the task is to build a dam, dredge 1.5 kilometers of ditches, build 6 roads, repair 9 kilometers of dikes, and dredge 270 ponds. In total, over 50,000 people must be mobilized for work in both urban and rural areas. The method of recruiting laborers is in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan, requiring all draftees aged 18 to 45 to respond. All matters regarding recruitment, dispatch, and deployment will be handled jointly by the Self-Government Affairs Office and the District Offices, together with the National Military Training Council. At the same time, with reference to the previous year's successful case, a National Labor Service Committee will be organized by relevant municipal agencies to take charge of the work in groups, cooperating fully, totaling 11 agencies, divided into General Affairs, Public Works, Propaganda, Recruitment, Supervision, and Health. Currently, in rural areas, work in the Shangxinhe district is scheduled to begin on the 19th of this month, the Xiaolingwei district on the 20th, and the Yanziji district on the 21st. Work in the urban area is also planned to begin on the 1st of next month. The scope of this year's National Labor Service is larger than last year's, and the dredging of the Qin Huai River, which has been neglected for many years, by mobilizing civilian workers is particularly innovative. It is hoped that everyone will pool their efforts and actively participate, and it is further hoped that the people can understand the government's purpose of organizing labor service, enabling them to use their spare time from farming to contribute enthusiastically, cultivating the spirit of practical hard work and serving the country."</p>
<h3>Travelogue of Bian and Luo</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Mingxin</p>
<p>Since the Xi'an Incident occurred on December 12th of last year, a month has passed in an instant. Initially, due to Chairman Chiang's presence in Xi'an, active military arrangements were made in Shaanxi Province. Even after Chairman Chiang's safe return to Nanjing, military actions ceased to advance. However, after Yang Hucheng disobeyed orders, the central government had no choice but to remain on high alert. Considering the original intention, there was no desire for aggression, but being forced into this situation, like holding a venomous snake in hand, a strong man must sever his wrist. The situation could not be avoided. Zhengzhou and Luoyang were the only transportation routes to Shaanxi, and thus became the center of the rear. The reporter, undeterred by the cold weather at the end of the year, made this journey to understand the situation and satisfy the eager expectations of the nation. The reporter traveled from Shanghai to Zhengzhou by Eurasian Aviation aircraft. The wind was gentle, the fields were abundant, and the weary birds flew as usual, nothing worth mentioning. Gradually, I learned that Eurasian had a special charter flight to Xi'an. At that time, I thought that this lone goose flying to the cloud nets would guide harmony, although the future results could not be predicted. The exchange of messengers would undoubtedly leave room for improvement. I secretly hoped for its success and awaited its development. Upon arriving at Zhengzhou Station, the reporter briefly stayed in Zhengzhou. At that time, I thought that the front line must be on alert and the rear must be tense. However, after arriving in Zhengzhou, strolling through the streets, I was surprised to find it peaceful and calm. Asking the locals, I realized that ㊀ military deployments had already been completed, and at this time, they were only supplementing and rotating troops, so the ground was not disturbed at all. ㊁ In recent years, military governance has improved. Soldiers passing through do not arbitrarily occupy residences or forcibly buy and sell goods, so the people live in harmony with them. ㊂ The people generally believe that national self-reliance and resistance to foreign aggression is the only way to save the country, and that domestic trifles can be easily resolved. All of these are signs of the country's progress in recent years, so they are worth writing about in detail. However, looking back at the city, it was mostly quiet. Although it was not affected by the passage of troops, it still did not show prosperity during this time of abundant agricultural harvests. I also eagerly wanted to know the reason and inquired about it. There were two main reasons: First, Zhengzhou is a transportation hub connecting east, west, north, and south, and it is also a center for cotton collection. Therefore, the prosperity of its market depends on external trading firms, not on local consumption. Currently, the Longhai Railway connects east and west, and the market in Chang'an also has a westward trend. Although gathering in one place is better than scattered production areas, it is still affected to some extent. In other words, this may be a reflection of the development of the northwest, and it should not be hastily regarded as a decline in the local commercial market of Zhengzhou. Second, this year's Shaanxi cotton harvest was abundant. In mid-December, when it was about to be shipped out, an incident suddenly occurred, and railway transport was suspended, with hundreds of thousands of packages stranded in the province. The stagnation of transshipment also caused financial stagnation. This is a temporary aberration, but it is not difficult to recover from. The administration of Zhengzhou is becoming more and more organized, and the city appearance is also good. Commissioner Ruan, in cracking the case of the Japanese spy agency, was unwavering, followed the law, and was praised by those in the know. This has been detailed in various newspapers, so there is no need to elaborate further. However, some friends who have seen the contents of the documents have revealed some details that are amusing. The people in charge often submitted untrue and incomplete reports, and even kept multiple blank restaurant receipts to fabricate proof of reimbursement. In addition, some people in that country had deep addictions, and smoking paraphernalia was present. Furthermore, there were countless documents of fraudulent expenses and mutual accusations. Therefore, after the case was discovered, the secretary of the embassy and the local consul also felt uneasy, which is enough to know. Zhengzhou has always been accustomed to extravagance. Recently, smoking and gambling have been banned. For smokers, they are issued licenses on an annual basis according to the central government's regulations. Although this has only just started this year, taking small steps to achieve distant goals is commendable. The reporter stayed for one day and then hurried to Luoyang, taking the newly arrived blue steel train on the Longhai Railway, which was more comfortable than the Shanghai-Ping. Thanks to Qian Zongze's efforts, the Longhai Railway has made rapid progress in materials, vehicles, locomotives, and roadwork over the years, achieving today's results. Just last year, more than 20 locomotives, several blue steel trains, and more than 20,000 tons of freight cars were added. The various machinery in the repair shop can be said to be the result of overcoming hardships. Debt repayment and passenger transport are now within reach. Unexpectedly, the Xi'an Incident came, and the railway was the first to bear the brunt. Property was damaged, and passenger transport was suspended. The estimated loss was more than ten million yuan. How could these not be the resources of the country and the material strength of the railway bureau? Therefore, every time Qian mentioned it, he sighed and could not control himself. After arriving in Luoyang, I went to the city. The streets were smooth and the people were bustling. Although there were many temporary troops stationed there, there were no signs of chaos in the city. The occupied areas were mostly public places, such as libraries and parts of schools. The senior military officers mostly resided in the residences on Longhai Road. These residences were originally for the staff, and they were used to accommodate guests. It was not difficult. This small place was the temporary capital of the National Government during the January 28th Incident, and these staff residences were also the locations of various ministries. Recalling the past, it is full of thoughts. Currently, the headquarters of Director Liu Zhi is located where the National Government was, and the magnificent characters "National Government" are still there as a memorial, which is enough to make the people of the country deeply reflect. After arriving in Luoyang, I learned that the plane that went to Shaanxi yesterday had returned to Nanjing, and that Shaanxi was more likely to achieve peace and show remorse. This was the good news I received during my journey, which can be used as the conclusion of this dispatch. (Sent from Luoyang on the 16th)</p>
<h3>Recent News on the Case of Shen Junru and Others in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Lawyers Shen Junru, Shi Liang, Wang Zaoshi, Sha Qianli, and four other people were arrested in Suzhou and held in the Jiangsu Higher Court Detention Center. However, due to serious suspicion, visits were suspended, and precautions were very tight. On the 19th, Prosecutor Yu Zanian conducted another interrogation in the detention center's branch office.</p>
<h3>Accidental Fatality in Jiading's Winter Defense</h3>
<p>In this county, several "wuwu" boats often join together and go deep into the countryside to steal chickens and ducks, or even commit robbery. When villagers chase and try to catch them, they flee, and some even resist. On the evening of the 18th, the Wai Gang Winter Defense Office received a report that four of the aforementioned "wuwu" boats were in the Yantieh River near the Tonggang Temple in the south market of the town.巡官 Zhu Shengying, the patrol officer of the public security substation, 叶秋鼎, the mayor of the town, and 谭思源, the platoon leader, led a team to search the boats. The first boat was normal, but the people in the second boat ignored them. After shouting for a long time, they heard movements and chicken calls inside the boat. 排长 Tan, fearing the unexpected, brought two live ammunition from his box. However, due to carelessness, he accidentally triggered the mechanism, and the bullet was fired, hitting a man named 伏 Hu in the cabin, entering from his left shoulder and exiting from his right rib, piercing his heart and lungs, causing him to bleed to death. Upon seeing the tragedy, Tan and others fled in panic, and the remaining two boats that had not been searched escaped. The deceased, 伏 Hu, was 29 years old and from Yancheng. He left behind a baby girl, only three months old. His husband, 伏如白, was 28 years old. The county government, after receiving the report, sent 何华, a supervisor from the Public Security Bureau, to investigate on the morning of the 19th, confirming that he had died from a bullet wound. The townspeople collected money to buy a coffin for the body. The perpetrator, 谭思源, was sent to the county by more than ten members of the winter defense team to surrender himself. The county government detained him for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Drug Offenders Arrested in Nantong</h3>
<p>In a half-month-long general review of drugs in Nantong, more than a thousand drug offenders were arrested, including more than eighty drug dealers, of whom more than sixty have already been sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>Interrogation in the Danyang Prostitution and Coercion Case</h3>
<p>陈雨春, a resident of No. 28 Yanzi Lane in the city of this county, married 王 named 女顺姑 from No. 5 Wutong Mountain as his daughter-in-law through a matchmaker many years ago. After she entered the door, she was raped by an unnamed civil servant on the first night and left. On the second night, she was raped by 王, who often came to the Chen family. Shun Gu, after being stimulated by this, planned to swallow gold to commit suicide but was discovered by her family, who urgently rescued her and gave her medicine. Unexpectedly, she suddenly became deaf and mute. Shun Gu's mother, upon hearing this, immediately took her back home and filed a lawsuit with the county government, accusing 陈雨春 of coercing her into prostitution for profit and detaining her, causing injury and disability. After receiving the lawsuit, the county government, led by County Magistrate Jiang, interrogated her personally at 9:00 am the other day. According to the plaintiffs, Ms. Wang and her daughter, the mother and daughter of the 王孙 family, narrated the case and said that the defendant 王影亭 was addicted to smoking opium and had not obtained a quit-smoking license in accordance with the regulations. Subsequently, the defendants Chen Yuchun and Wang Yinting denied the allegations of coercing her into prostitution for profit. County Magistrate Jiang, after reviewing the statements of both parties, determined that the case still needed investigation and ordered each defendant to post bail. Wang Yinting was found to be privately smoking opium, and he was sent to the addiction treatment center to verify whether he was addicted before further investigation.</p>
<h3>Kerosene Prices Suddenly Soar in Gaoyou</h3>
<p>Kerosene is sold widely in this county. Although there is an electric light factory, there are not many users, and the electricity is not sufficient. Therefore, most shops use gasoline lamps, and households all use kerosene lamps. 美孚, 亚细亚, 光华, and other brands are the most popular in this county. On the 15th, after the managers of each dealership received the price increase notice, speculators rushed to buy from various stores, increasing the price by five corners per box (two cans) compared to before.</p>

<h3>Ding Mingyi Overwhelms Medina, the First Person After Li Gongying</h3>
<p>The amateur group A Billiards Championship, the King of Billiards Won 977 to 1000 Points</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Group A Billiards Championship began the night before last. 苏若 defeated 克拉克 with 1000 points to 875 points. Last night, our country's famous player 丁明毅 met with last year's champion, the King of Billiards, 麦迪那. Mr. 丁, unexpectedly, made a name for himself, actually overwhelming the King of Billiards with 1000 points to 977 points, eliminating 麦迪那. It cannot be said that this is not a great achievement in the Chinese amateur billiards world this year. The former King of Billiards was eliminated by a total difference of 23 points. The entire game was played in a tense atmosphere. In the first half, 麦迪那 took the lead all the way, but 丁 followed closely behind without panic. At the end of the first half, 麦迪那 had 502 points, and 丁明毅 had 406 points, a difference of 96 points.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the second half, 丁 gradually intensified his efforts, directly approaching 麦迪那. 麦, unexpectedly, was threatened by this and showed panic. At 750 points, 丁 achieved a surprising victory, suddenly taking the lead in front of 麦. Although 李 tried his best to reverse the victory, even achieving an amazing score of 100 points in one shot, the final result was still of no avail. 丁 won with 1000 points to 977 points. 丁 is the first person to defeat 麦迪那 after 李公颖. The huge scores of the two are as follows:</p>
<p>(丁明毅) First half 39, 29, 20, 20, 27, 20, 35; Second half 26, 47, 35, 37, 22, 43, 34, 27, 22.</p>
<p>(麦迪那) First half 36, 37, 24, 34, 21, 27, 48, 39, 57; Second half 24, 27, 20, 20, 43, 28, 100, 22.</p>
<h3>Failing to Sustain Momentum, Chi Zhi Suffers a Crushing Defeat to Mai Ling</h3>
<p>Each Scores 28 Points in the First Half; Result is 57 to 46</p>
<p>In the second match of Shanghai Basketball Group A, Chi Zhi and Mai Ling met last night. The two teams are in different groups in Xiqing and have never met before. This was their first meeting. Chi Zhi, as a newborn calf, is not afraid of tigers. They are good at shooting baskets and especially good at interception. After the match began, Su Yinghai opened the scoring with a free throw, followed by another. Chi Zhi took a 3-0 lead first. Locke scored, and Su got another free throw, still leading 4-2. After that, Locke tied the score, but Zhang and Liang scored for Chi Zhi, leading again with 12-10. After that, from 14-12 and 16-14, Chi Zhi led. Locke scored twice, and Mai Ling finally broke through. Before long, Chi Zhi suddenly took a four-point lead with 22-18 due to Liang's two throws and Su's two free throws. This was the peak of Chi Zhi's power. However, Mai Ling soon tied the score again, 28-28, ending the first half. Although the situation passed in shock and was extremely tense, the result was still undecided. After the break, 开顿 opened the scoring. Zhang and Liang scored twice for Chi Zhi, leading again. However, in an instant, Mai Ling scored five consecutive goals, taking a lead of eight points. In addition, Liang Yunming of Chi Zhi was injured in Guangdong yesterday. After this fierce battle, his foot injury relapsed, and he withdrew to rest. 徐沛生 replaced him, but he was not discouraged. Soon, Zhang and Chen scored twice, and the difference was only two balls (40-36). After 潘洛司尔 of Mai Ling scored, 阿勃特 加因 was sent off after committing four fouls. 徐沛生 scored a free throw again, and 苏英海 continued to score, and the score gradually closed (42-41). Chi Zhi was about to recover its momentum. However, after 潘洛司尔 and 苏英海 each scored a goal, they were too eager to succeed, and 詹廷瑞 and 陈学𥚢 successively committed fouls, so Mai Ling scored with free throws and added nine points in one go. Chi Zhi still tried hard to follow. Although 张良雄 added three points, time was running out, and Chi Zhi finally lost with 57 points to 46.

<h3>Chinese Departures from Inter-Port Teams Confirmed</h3>
<p>Western Football Club Issues Notice Yesterday: Roster Reorganized with All-Western Lineup</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that Sun, Chen, and Feng have withdrawn from the Shanghai Inter-Port Football Team. However, the reason is not as severe as rumored yesterday. The three withdrew simply because the newly revived Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Inter-Port Games are scheduled to be held in Hong Kong during the Lunar New Year. Although the official date has not been determined, they feared a conflict. Even if the dates differed, they worried that the extended holiday would interfere with their duties. To remain available for the Chinese Inter-Port Games, they had no choice but to withdraw. This was not a result of a disagreement with the Shanghai Western Football Club. The Shanghai Western Football Club has already re-evaluated the Inter-Port selections and newly selected Brewing, Newberg, and Cochrane from the Lux Club to join the team. However, Yates from the Labour Club was dropped. A total of seventeen players remain. The lineup for this week's trial match has also been arranged. The defense will consist of Bow Sai-chung as goalkeeper and Victoria Díaz from Portugal as the full-back. The center defense line will be Perth Chen from the French Club and Chen Zhenhe. The forward line will have Brewing as the center forward, with Tiller and Habers from the Labour Club on the right wing, and James and Boscut from the French Club on the left wing. It is likely that this will become their official lineup going forward. The club officially announced these changes and the withdrawal of the Chinese players yesterday, stating that the Chinese players were unable to accompany the Inter-Port team to Hong Kong due to work commitments. Therefore, the Inter-Port lineup for the three trial matches announced the day before has been changed. All selected players must still arrive at the field by 2:30 PM and bring their own shorts and shoes. The schedule for Saturday's First Division League has also been slightly adjusted, with the Lux vs. Western Merchants match changed to Western Merchants vs. St. Francis. The reorganized lineup and the revised schedule are listed below.</p>
<p>Reorganized Ideal Team Lineup</p>

<h3>Grain</h3>
<p>Flour and Wheat Fall Continuously</p>
<p>Low British and American Wheat Prices Stimulate Market Sentiment - Flour and Wheat Prices Too High Reduce Demand - Wheat Down Small Angle, Half Flour Down 75</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report from Liverpool on the 19th, the Liverpool wheat market was pressured by Argentinian wheat, and there were hopes for a good harvest of American winter wheat. Therefore, many parties released large amounts of wheat, especially for March delivery. However, long-term factors are bullish, such as excessive loading of Canadian wheat, the quality of new Argentinian wheat, and increased grain reserves in various countries. For example, rumors that Britain is using grain reserves as a national defense plan, and the situation of using miscellaneous grains for feed is still tight. Germany's wheat reserves are very low. In November of last year, Germany's wheat reserves were only 521,000 tons, compared to 1,325,000 tons in November of the previous year. Therefore, those who are concerned about the wheat market are optimistic.</p>
<p>The Chicago wheat market fell 1.125 to 2.375 points due to the liquidation of foreign markets and long positions.</p>
<p>The local wheat market is also depressed. Domestic flour sales have invisibly decreased due to high prices. The wheat market cannot prosper alone. After the market opened, prices for various months fell by 56 to 89 points. Until the afternoon opening, those with goods thought about delivering for the current month because there were only four or five days until delivery. However, factory stomachs were as flat as usual, causing even more anxiety. Prices continued to fall by 56 points. Distant months were more stable, with prices only falling by 131 points. Currently, the wheat market is completely stagnant because the standard has plummeted endlessly and the price must be reduced.</p>
<p>After the flour market opened in the morning, prices continued to plummet for various months. Chicago's quotation for foreign wheat fell 70 cents, Canada's fell 4, 6, and 7 cents, and Liverpool's fell 1 penny. Therefore, after the opening price, market sentiment was greatly shaken. Due to the frequent declines in the quotation for foreign wheat, domestic sentiment also changed due to the stagnation of actual sales. Therefore, the opening price for both near and distant months immediately fell by 56 points compared to the previous day. Afterward, sentiment continued to weaken and market sentiment continued to soften. However, after continuous sharp declines, some floating positions rose to replenish, so sentiment seemed to temporarily stabilize. Until the afternoon opening, prices fell to a low of 3.835 yuan for the current month because delivery was near and long positions had to be liquidated. February also fell to 3.86 yuan, and March to 3.905 yuan, with a difference of one dime from the previous day's closing price. Later, long positions were less likely to be reduced and short positions were thinking about replenishing, so prices gradually stabilized by two or three points. Compared to the rising prices before the year, there was a trend of absolute shortage of goods. Now, there is no end to the decline, with no turning back. This is because the situation of supply and demand is different, resulting in a downward trend.</p>
<p>Bean Cake Breaks 2 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Shantou Gang Buys Actively After Price Drop</p>
<p>Yesterday's bean cake market saw Lianlian plummet in Dalian, causing local sentiment to fall. First, the brokers and domestic households released goods, so the "Four-Brand Cake" market immediately saw a sharp drop. Moreover, factories with thick goods were shouting for cheap sales, so the market price fell below the 2 yuan mark, cutting to 1.98 yuan. This caused the Shantou Gang to take advantage of the cheap price to buy actively. As a result, 23,000 pieces of Four-Brand Cake from various factories were traded. In addition, 15,000 futures contracts were traded for delivery in February and 5,000 contracts for delivery in March from the Dade New Factory. According to future trends, it may not be overly repaired for the time being, because there are still inquiries about the way to go, and bean prices are not easy to be too humiliated. However, the big end period is approaching, and there may still be changes in the middle.</p>
<p>Guang Gang Meets Small Purchase of Ke Xian Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for Ke Xian rice saw the original Ke rice business very sluggish in the morning, and the market price immediately dropped a small amount. Later, because the Guang Gang had stopped business for several days, it saw that the price was small and cost-effective, and immediately purchased all kinds of brown rice smoothly in the market, totaling more than 20,000 bags. Machine rice also purchased 2,000 to 3,000 bags. There was no smooth stomach in this street, but because the Guang Gang was lively, it also slightly entertained, so it also formed 3,000 to 4,000 bags on the whole day. The whole day's transaction was very prosperous, totaling 26,000 bags. However, the market price still saw a fatigue reduction of several points to near the corner, because the Cantonese Gang was eating the price very tightly, and there were too many stocks in the market, and the cargo owners and brokers also tried to reduce the price to sell smoothly, so the large transaction was caused by the price reduction.</p>
<p>He Mi North Market Road Slightly Smooth</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of each gang arrived at more than 40 houses, about 8,300 to 8,400 stone of goods. Among them, there were about 20 houses of Bo Dao. The street market's smooth sales are rarely adopted every day, the package stomach is not prosperous, only Qingdao Yantai Gang handles 2,000 or so bags of Bo Dao, so the situation suddenly becomes soft and drooping. As a result, except for high-quality materials, which are still fixed due to the scarcity of goods, the middle-section goods have all been repaired from a few points to the corner. It is even more difficult to fix the thick japonica, and it has been reduced by more than one corner. Judging from the current situation, it seems that there is little hope of turning good for a while. Du Jian follows 5 minutes less, the foreign tip is more stagnant, and it is even more difficult to change the corner and cause the arrival of limited goods, and there should be no ups and downs.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 33 to 34 ships arrived from various places in Hexia, and various transactions in the market were slightly active. Since the price of goods on medium japonica is flat and tired, the price of lower japonica is tight at 34 points, the tip of the sheep is less goods, and the price is nearly a corner. The price of thin rice is increased by 67 points, the price of early rice is higher by several points, and the price of Bai Yuan is slightly tight. The situation of Dufu sheep tip and other goods is standing tall.</p>
<h3>Gauze Flower</h3>
<p>Current Gauze Price Plummets, Standard Market Trembles</p>
<p>Factory Foundations Relaxed, Short Selling Active, Sufficient Chips for Delivery This Month</p>
<p>The gauze market lingered for several days, but yesterday a sharp decline occurred. Because spot sales were sluggish and factory foundations became increasingly relaxed, morale was weak. Spot gauze prices plummeted, and short sellers became active, making it increasingly difficult to support market prices. It was also said that there were sufficient chips for delivery this month, so selling was particularly intense. The bulls, including Indian merchants, not only failed to spend more, but by the time of closing, futures contracts for February and earlier were generally dragged down, supported by the market price.</p>
<p>Recent Marked Gauze Especially Weak</p>
<p>The opening price of marked gauze varied across different months, with near-term contracts weak and distant contracts slightly stable. As the delivery period for this month approached, rumors circulated of 3,000 to 4,000 bales being delivered, so even though the bulls held on, the market still lacked upward momentum. At the same time, spot gauze transactions were quiet, and spot prices were gradually decreasing, leading to apathy. As a result, each month's price fell by 127 coppers compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, the decline intensified, and selling pressure suddenly increased, mainly due to the sharp fall in spot gauze prices. The price of 20-count Red Man Bell gauze plummeted by 5 to 6 yuan compared to the previous day, causing morale to falter. Affected by this, market prices gradually declined. By the time of closing, the bulls again bought in a weak attempt to support prices. As a result, each month's price fell by 1.8 to 2.1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. Checks revealed that Dafu sold 1,310 bales, Shenji 1,300 bales, Hengde 900 bales, Senkang 2,050 bales, Changyu 1,750 bales, Runkang 3,300 bales, Hengchang 850 bales, and Xinhua 900 bales. Hengyi bought 2,400 bales, Changfeng 700 bales, Gengfeng 4,650 bales, Changji 600 bales, Renfeng 850 bales, Yichang 1,200 bales, and Changfeng 5,150 bales. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Gauze Falls 3-4 Yuan</p>
<p>Spot gauze sales remained flat. Checks revealed that various trading houses bought a total of 436 bales throughout the day, with prices falling by 3 to 4 yuan. The buying volume of each trading house is listed below: Jiangxi 5, Guangdong 75, Mainland 58, Counterparts 25, Changsha 0, Ningbo 0, Henan 53, Total 435.</p>
<p>Cotton Pulled Down by Cotton Yarn</p>
<p>The cotton market declined due to weakness in the yarn market. The cotton market, which is closely linked to yarn, was pulled into the vortex. However, the bulls held firm and did not give up, making it difficult to loosen prices in various production areas.</p>
<p>Marked Cotton Suddenly Drops Half a Yuan in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The opening price of marked cotton was slightly lower across different months, but the momentum was relatively flat. American cotton fell by 4 to 10 points, Indian cotton rose by 0.25 to 1 rupee, and Osaka's third-grade cotton saw mixed ups and downs. Market morale remained dispersed, and there was nothing exciting to report. As a result, each month's price rose or fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. After the afternoon opening, due to unfavorable news from the yarn market, the cotton market was dragged down, and each month's price fell by 2.5 to 4.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Checks revealed that Tonghe sold 3,600 dan, Tonghu 2,500 dan, Fengtai 2,800 dan, Yuda 4,100 dan, Zhenda 2,200 dan, Yichang 2,200 dan, and Runkang 8,800 dan. Dafu bought 1,200 dan, Hengyi 7,300 dan, Jinchang 9,100 dan, Hexing 1,300 dan, Taixing 2,700 dan, Taichang 1,900 dan, Xinchang 2,600 dan, and Changhe 2,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices of the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Consumption Remains Sluggish</p>
<p>Mills are not buying spot cotton. Sources included 1,090 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Many Long Positions in American Cotton Unwind</p>
<p>Export Permits for Indian Cotton Haven't Been Received from Japan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening price of American cotton was sluggish, with each month falling by 1 to 5 points. The issue of sales through loans remained uncertain, labor unrest worsened, Japan regulated foreign exchange, and buyers of various important goods, due to the easing of the European situation, unwound their positions to take profits, causing market prices to fall. Local bulls also engaged in resales. Fortunately, counterparts continued to buy March contracts, slightly reducing the downward pressure, and the market stabilized. Later, the stock market weakened, and large-scale selling from Western and New Orleans emerged, causing the decline to resume. By the time of closing, counterparts bought near-term contracts, showing a slight rebound. Spot goods fell by 4 points, futures fell by 4 to 10 points. English cotton spot goods rose by 4 points, futures fell by 1 point. Indian cotton exporters were anxious as they had not received permits from Japan for a long time and engaged in slight selling, which later strengthened. Pingguoer rose by 0.25 to 1 rupee, while Guangzhou and Bai Luoxi both rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is on the left (telegram of the 19th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening price prediction for the 20th was: Bai Luoxi 226.5 rupees, Aomula 203 rupees, and Pingguoer 170.5 rupees, all rising by 1 rupee.</p>
<p>Osaka Yarn Spot Up, Futures Down</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Osaka on the 20th, spot yarn rose by 6 to 11 yuan. 16-count Fan faced yarn was 253 yuan, up 6 yuan; 20-count Goldfish yarn was 272 yuan, up 6 yuan; 40-count Five Star yarn was 400 yuan, up 10 yuan; 42-count Pheasant yarn was 398 yuan, up 11 yuan. Futures yarn fell by 0.5 to 2.1 yuan, with near-term at 272.5 yuan and distant-term at 256.4 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.1 to rise by 0.7 yuan, with near-term at 74.9 yuan and distant-term at 78.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<p>Diminishing Interest in Hoarding Cotton Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday's cotton cloth market was affected by the sharp decline in the domestic yarn market, with spot yarn falling by 3.4 yuan and futures yarn falling by 2 yuan. Cloth merchants were generally apprehensive. Although the Eastern goods fine cloth market was slightly firm the previous day due to a squeeze, the market soon reversed as the Tianjin merchants leaned towards selling, and selling pressure caused prices to fall back. Fine cloth fell by 5 to 7.5 fen per bolt, and grey cloth fell by 5 fen. Dyeing factories and mainland merchants bought on dips, with over 300 bales changing hands. It is noted that the trading volume the previous day was 1,400 to 1,500 pieces, mainly driven by hoarding mentality. The current sharp decline is due to the decrease in speculative buying. The local factory and British merchant Jardine's coarse cloth saw flexible movements due to scarce inventory, and futures contracts remained high, so prices were also firm. The decline was most pronounced in fine twill. The market continued to fall by 5 to 7.5 fen yesterday. Currently, due to seasonal factors, the demand for fine twill has decreased significantly. The price of Eastern goods fine twill has fallen below that of fine cloth. Although there are reports of local factory fine twill movements, the quota restrictions are severe, and the inventory of various factories is gradually increasing, causing the market to weaken more rapidly than other goods. Spring/Summer goods like striped plain silk crepe, linen yarn, and white ground satin continue to see orders for both futures and spot goods. Dark-colored printed goods, pique, thread twill, and shandong trading houses, local streets, zhejiang roads, wenzhou and taizhou trading houses saw some transactions.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>

<p>Yesterday's government bond market trended from weak to upward, mainly because a certain large buyer continued to sell in large quantities, and morale was weary due to the prevailing environment.

<h3>Overview of Tea Exports in the 25th Year</h3>
<p>Both Black and Green Tea Increase Significantly, Brick Tea Exports Plunge</p>
<p>According to statistics released by the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the total amount of Chinese tea exported from Shanghai in the 25th year (including Hankou tea re-exported through Shanghai) was 297,174.76 quintals. Although it was still far behind the 23rd year by more than 73,000 quintals, it increased by more than 6,800 quintals compared to the 24th year, indicating that the external export of Chinese tea has turned back to the path of recovery. However, the future still depends on the efforts of the tea industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the export situation of various types of tea, the exports of black tea, green tea, and other teas have all increased compared to the 24th year, especially the increase in green tea was the largest. It is noted that green tea exports to Africa were quite strong last year. Today, it is the only sales market for Chinese green tea, and its development is on the rise. However, it is said that the green tea of a certain country is eager to seize the market there, and recently used dumping policies to actively expand sales. This is very worthy of attention by our tea industry.</p>
<p>The export of brick tea has declined significantly. It is noted that brick tea is mostly transported to the Soviet Union. In recent years, the Soviet Union has also had large-scale tea business operations, gradually trending towards self-sufficiency. Chinese tea lost this major customer, which suffered a major impact. The monthly export volume for the 25th year and the comparison of the total number of recent three years, and the national statistics are listed below for reference by those who care about the tea (unit quintal).</p>

<h3>Luo Siwei</h3>
<p>— Su Zihan</p>
<p>Determination is Strength</p>
<p>Luo Siwei never did things ambiguously in his life. Whatever he got his hands on, he knew how to handle it, and handled it correctly. Luo Siwei hadn't read many books, but he had plenty of experience.</p>
<p>Luo Siwei had a bit of land, but not much. It was a square, neat piece that was pleasing to the eye. This piece of land was truly not bad. It had convenient water access, and yielded harvests of rice, wheat, and vegetables. Luo Siwei had grown to this age relying on this piece of land.</p>
<p>In the past, this piece of land was surrounded by similar fields, inhabited by farmers like Luo Siwei. But in the past few years, things had gradually changed. Good farmland was turning into grassland, ball fields, and "foreign houses." The "foreign houses" were all inhabited by "foreigners" with high noses and green eyes, increasing in number every day. Later, they recruited many Chinese students and established universities, universities, and something called Canada University.</p>
<p>These fields were sold for a good price. For example, a field worth one hundred yuan per mu could be sold for at least one hundred and fifty, sometimes even two or three hundred. The "foreigners" had offered three hundred and fifty yuan per mu for Luo Siwei's land, but Luo Siwei didn't care about the money and refused to sell. No matter how powerful the "foreigners" were, how much they could oppress people, he would never sell, and there was nothing they could do about it.</p>
<p>Over the past ten years, the land surrounding Luo Siwei had all become "foreigners'." But Luo Siwei didn't care, and continued to cultivate his field and spread his manure. The stench drifted from the grassland, intruding into the foreign houses.</p>
<p>Luo Siwei's land was right in the heart of this special zone. It was surrounded by very beautiful "foreign houses" and grassland, with a few thatched houses in the middle, which certainly didn't look very nice. The "foreigners" wanted to take this piece of land day and night, but money couldn't move Luo Siwei's heart, so they could only watch Luo Siwei spread manure on his field.</p>
<p>The "foreigners" hated Luo Siwei immensely. Upon hearing what someone said, they built a clock tower not far from Luo Siwei's thatched house. This clock tower cost a lot of construction, just the bricks alone cost tens of thousands. Finally, a clock tower stood tall on "Love Pond." This special zone was a place with beautiful scenery in Chengdu. On good days in spring and autumn, and on weekends, many people went to stroll there, including many "lovers," and many hooligans and prostitutes. So many people called this pond "Love Pond."</p>
<p>When Luo Siwei saw how tall the clock tower was, he was quite surprised at first. After carefully measuring it, he realized that the clock tower was exactly to the left of his thatched house. Luo Siwei immediately joked with himself, muttering, "Left Green Dragon, Right White Tiger, the Green Dragon raises its head. Good, I'll have good luck and make a fortune every year! You foreign devils, you miscalculated."</p>
<p>Luo Siwei continued his life as usual, cultivating his field and spreading manure, without paying any attention to them.</p>
<p>Would the "foreigners" give up from then on? No way. So every few days, people came to Luo Siwei's house to make trouble, using both soft and hard tactics. Fortunately, Luo Siwei had plenty of experience, and had made up his mind: he wouldn't sell! Wild horses couldn't drag him, a white knife in and a red knife out, it was all the same! He was determined not to sell!</p>
<p>At first, Luo Siwei didn't want to sell this piece of land, just thinking that it had been passed down from his ancestors, and that he could make a living off of it, so why sell it and get a reputation as a spendthrift. Later, one year, the "foreigners" suddenly wanted to build a wall around the area, blocking the small paths and damming the waterways, and everyone opposed it. Students often came to "Huaxi Dam" to give speeches, saying: This school is a major base for foreigners to invade southwestern China. Now they want to build a wall to make this place a fortress, a stronghold, when there is trouble in Sichuan and Kang. We can't let them build it.</p>
<p>Luo Siwei suddenly understood after listening, and thought to himself, "No wonder they keep wanting to buy my land, it's because they want to connect it into one piece, to make it easier to do things. Fine, now I'm even less likely to sell it. If the foreign devils cause trouble, I'll be an inside man and mess with them."</p>
<p>Luo Siwei's refusal to sell his land was no longer just because it was his ancestors' legacy.</p>
<p>That time, the "foreigners'" wall was not built, and the ones that had already been built were pushed down by the people.</p>
<p>This day was a beautiful spring day. There were no clouds in the morning, and the sun shone directly on the top of the clock tower. Luo Siwei sat outside his thatched house, smoking his leaf tobacco pipe. People were already active by "Love Pond."</p>
<p>The wheat was growing vigorously, and the cabbage and greens were also thriving, with white mixed with green, and green mixed with white, like flowers all over the ground, very beautiful.</p>
<p>The crops were good, and Luo Siwei was indescribably happy.</p>
<p>Just then, a person came along the road, turned at the small path, and walked towards Luo Siwei's thatched house.</p>
<p>As he got closer, Luo Siwei saw the person clearly, and cursed in his heart, "It's that guy again." He unconsciously spat out a mouthful of saliva onto the ground.</p>
<p>The person who came was Yuan Hua, Teacher Yuan, who worked as a runner for the "foreigners."</p>
<p>Although Luo Siwei was unhappy with Yuan Hua, the visitor was a guest, and the host couldn't help but entertain him, so he had to stand up and greet him: "Teacher Yuan, how are you! Please sit down." As he spoke, he pushed a bamboo stool over.</p>
<p>Yuan Hua also said with a smile, "Siwei, how are you! Let's all sit down." Both men sat down. When Luo Siwei saw Yuan Hua's smiling face, he thought to himself, "He must be here again to talk about buying the land."</p>
<p>Sure enough, after three or five sentences of small talk, Yuan Hua brought up the topic of buying the land. He said: "Siwei, I advise you to sell it. Look! Everything around you is the church's, oh no, it's all the school's. What are you doing with this little bit of land? They've already offered five hundred silver dollars per mu. Sell it."</p>
<p>Luo Siwei said, "I won't sell!"</p>
<p>Yuan Hua continued: "Five hundred silver dollars per mu, that's a great price! You couldn't find that price anywhere else in the world. The Zhu family over there initially didn't want to sell, but now I hear that as long as the price is good, they're still selling. Once they sell, you'll be the only one left with land here, which will feel even worse. Brother Siwei, don't miss out on a good price!"</p>
<p>Luo Siwei said loudly: "I won't sell!"</p>
<p>Yuan Hua smiled. Luo Siwei didn't look at him. Yuan Hua took out a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, and offered Luo Siwei one. Luo Siwei pushed it away with his hand: "I don't smoke!" But Yuan Hua lit one for himself.</p>
<p>Yuan Hua smiled and said again: "Old brother, the price is good, it's good to sell it."</p>
<p>Luo Siwei couldn't hold back any longer, jumped up and said: "Teacher Yuan, you're too long-winded! I said I won't sell, then I won't sell. Go ask around, I, Luo Siwei, am well-known in this area of Nantaisi. Whatever I say, that's what I do. I'm not someone who's greedy for money!"</p>
<p>When Yuan Hua saw how angry Luo Siwei was, he didn't get angry at all, but instead resorted to threats: "What if they cut off your water supply!"</p>
<p>Luo Siwei said: "If they cut off my water supply, I'll go to the Dike Works Association. They wouldn't dare!"</p>
<p>Yuan Hua said again: "What if they ruin your crops?"</p>
<p>Luo Siwei said: "Then there's no law. If they let them loose, a white knife goes in, and a red knife comes out."</p>
<p>Yuan Hua laughed again! "Old brother, sell it, I'll talk to the school director and get you a job."</p>
<p>Luo Siwei said angrily: "Get lost!" After saying that, he went to get the manure bucket, preparing to water the vegetables. He ignored Yuan Hua. Yuan Hua, feeling unwelcome, had no choice but to sneak away.</p>
<p>When Luo Siwei was watering the vegetables, he saw a "foreigner" walking past, covering his nose with a handkerchief. He felt triumphant in his heart, and a layer of smile floated on his face.</p>
<p>Even now, the piece of land in the center of this special zone still belongs to Luo Siwei.</p>

<h3>How to Study Philosophy (7)</h3>
<p>— Yan Yilin</p>
<p>Authored by Wang Defu, published by Sanjiang Bookstore</p>
<p>㊈ Outline of the History of Philosophical Development The history of philosophical development can be roughly divided into three periods: first, ancient Greek philosophy; second, the philosophy of the period of religious rule; and third, modern philosophy. Ancient Greek philosophy was initiated by Thales of the Milesian school; he was born in Miletus and lived in the sixth century BC, and is known as the father of philosophy. He took water as the basic principle of all things; Thales' view of nature is of great significance. As for Parmenides, the founder of the Eleatic school, he regarded the "being" of matter and spirit as the only substance of the world, which implicitly contained the theory of skeptical ideas; and Pythagoras advocated the theory of reincarnation, which was completely returning to religious superstition. The fundamental opposition between the cosmology of the Milesian school and the Eleatic school led to the creation of a comprehensive movement by Empedocles in the middle of the fifth century BC, and then to Anaxagoras, Leucippus, and Democritus. In Democritus' view, sensation is the only source of knowledge, and thinking is the reflection of the senses and the impressions we get from the outside world. He was one of the most systematic materialists in ancient Greece. After that, Greek philosophy developed a theory of doubting nature and a tendency to pay special attention to human affairs. At this time, Protagoras, a skeptic, rose up, doubting the reliability of the senses, and gradually approached idealism. Then came a system of Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, etc.; their theory of the origin of the universe is that spirit precedes matter, and their epistemology and methodology also take abstract conceptual principles as the starting point. After that, in terms of materialism, there were Epicurus and Celsus; in terms of eclecticism, there was Zeno of the Stoic school; and in terms of skepticism, there was Pyrrho. This is a general overview of the development of ancient Greek philosophy. Second, the philosophy of the period of religious rule, this period began before the Christian era and lasted until the Renaissance, with the Neo-Platonic school and the Neo-Pythagorean school. Philosophy had become a handmaiden of theology before the fourth century AD, with Christian theology as the only doctrine, developing into patristic philosophy and scholastic philosophy, which dominated the entire Middle Ages for more than a thousand years. Second, the revival of modern philosophy was in the 13th century with Roger Bacon. Materialism, revived by Bacon, became more thorough with Hobbes. British materialism in the 17th century, with Spinoza and Locke, solved the problem of knowledge in great detail and fully. In France in the 16th and 17th centuries, Descartes' philosophy emerged. He advocated the theory that spirit and matter became opposite to each other, which was completely the true color of dualism. The successors in the 18th and 19th centuries were the famous Berkeley, Hume, and Leibniz, who were champions of idealism in England and Germany. In 1724, Kant was born. He synthesized Plato's and Descartes' theory of innate ideas, synthesized Hobbes' and Locke's theory of sensation and empiricism, and also synthesized Berkeley's and Hume's pure sensationalism, pure empiricism, and the skepticism of the unknowability of things. He also took Leibniz's philosophy of acknowledging entities as the starting point, and also had naturalism. From Kant to Fichte, Schelling, and Mach, this was another debate between idealism and materialism. The last was Hegel, the greatest of the idealists, but his main influence was in the field of materialism. After Feuerbach, Marx, Engels, Lafargue, Kautsky, Plekhanov, Lenin, etc. were the most important materialist philosophers. This is a brief overview of the development of modern philosophy.</p>
<h3>Yuan Yingchang's The Peacock Flies Southeast and Others (3)</h3>
<p>— Kui Feng</p>
<p>2. Other One-Act Plays</p>
<p>There are too many and too long monologues in this play, and the power of expression is weak in the key places of the plot.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The pauses in the play are to create an atmosphere of gradual tension. Although the play contains the meaning of expressing life, the trivialities of ordinary life are also inserted into the play, which is very undesirable.</p>
<p>In the first act, when the grandmother comes to the Jiao family, there is a conversation:</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, I'll ask someone to bring tea for grandmother to drink, okay?</p>
<p>Mother: Good, you go. Also bring some oranges and chestnuts for grandmother to drink with the tea.</p>
<p>Grandmother: Don't bother! Let's talk.</p>
<p>Sister: It's no trouble!</p>
<p>Second act</p>
<p>"Sister: Then I'll trouble grandmother! (At this time, the maid brings in tea and fruit. To the maid) Has the mistress come in?</p>
<p>Maid: Just came in. Washing her face in the room.</p>
<p>Sister: Go and invite her, say grandmother has come to see her (the maid nods and goes out, the little sister serves tea and fruit to the grandmother) Grandmother, please have some!"</p>
<p>This technique may be used by the author as a pause in the atmosphere, but, strictly speaking, the most common thing to do in a play performed on stage is to repeat the interlude. At the same time, this kind of interlude is not the best way to cultivate the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Regarding the overall opinion, there are basically these four points, which have already exceeded what was planned to be said.</p>
<p>In short, the playwright's ambition to write is admirable, especially to recreate existing buildings with new perspectives. This attempt is rare, although there are many shortcomings in technique. However, we cannot ignore that this is an achievement from five or six years ago. Compared with the progressive modern plays, it is naturally inevitable that the form and method are backward, but it has its value in the history of modern drama.</p>
<p>A. Synopsis of Each Play</p>
<p>In addition to The Peacock Flies Southeast, there are five other one-act plays, namely Living Poet, Who is the Scourge, Frontline Soldier, A Kiss Before Marriage, and The Way of Man.</p>
<p>Living Poet, Who is the Scourge, and A Kiss Before Marriage are all comedies, and also contain satirical comedies. Frontline Soldier is a patriotic play, and The Way of Man is a tragedy about marriage problems.</p>
<p>Living Poet writes about a girl who has three love interests. In order to make the final decision, she asks the three young men to each write a poem at a Ronghui meeting. The one with the best poetic talent will be engaged to her. When writing the poem, one of the young men narrates a white cat being bitten by a yellow dog. The judges immediately conclude that this young man is a living poet. Because: A poet must have the personality of a poet, and a poet must have the emotions of a poet. Without genuine feelings and a noble and perfect personality... one cannot become a true poet, a living poet! Mr. Wang disregarded his own life today and rescued the weak and incompetent kitten from the mouth of an inferior dog. At the time of his personal victory or defeat, he was able to take care of the life of a small creature. In my opinion, this is not only a poet, but also a real living poet." This passage can be said to be the main theme of writing this play.</p>
<p>Who is the Scourge writes about a married woman who falls in love with her husband's friend. When she is about to divorce, she finds that the person she loves is jealous, disappointed, and returns to her original husband.</p>
<p>A Kiss Before Marriage is purely a comedy close to nonsense, because the story is definitely not something that exists in reality. However, on the whole, it does not fail to sing the praises of love.</p>
<p>Frontline Soldier writes about Zhang Zongchang, a warlord in the Republic of China, who does not join the revolutionary army. A small soldier on the Zunming army side has his family seized by Zhang's subordinates, threatening the small soldier to assist in the rebellion. The small soldier is not tempted by profit and would rather sacrifice the lives of his whole family to capture and present the traitor to military law. The main theme is that the comrades who participated in the revolution have firm beliefs and finally achieve spiritual victory.</p>
<p>The Way of Man is a common problem of marriage, family, and love that are intertwined. In other words, it is the problem of the confrontation between love and obligation. It writes about a student who abandons his original wife after returning to China and marries another student, forming a love family. He does not bear the responsibility of being a husband or a father, but only seeks personal happiness in life. In the end, his conscience suddenly breaks out, but his beloved son dies of illness and his wife commits suicide. It is all too late.</p>
<p>B. The Content of the Play and the Significance of the Times</p>
<p>Looking at the plays as a whole, whether they are tragedies or comedies, their purpose of satirizing the world and awakening people is consistent. In the society of six or seven years ago, after the May Fourth Movement, the communication between Chinese and Western cultures was at its peak. At this time, the theory of free love was also advocated. For a time, things like Who is the Scourge and The Way of Man were indeed not fabricated. Of course, those who were able to awaken and struggle out were comedies, otherwise they would lead to tragedies such as death, displacement, and madness.</p>
<p>The social dynamics in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic of China were like this, and the reflection in literary works was inseparable from this stereotype. These few one-act plays by Yuan Changying were no exception.</p>
<p>At the same time, while one side showed the ugly side, the other side was also praying for perfect and happy love and marriage. Living Poet and A Kiss Before Marriage cannot hide these messages.</p>
<p>After the Northern Expedition of the Revolutionary Army, the international situation was not as pressing as it is today. Eliminating warlords and building politics were the people's hope and the authorities' ideal. This hope and this ideal were not without the hope of being realized. Frontline Soldier can indeed represent the beliefs of the majority of soldiers and civilians at that time, and the realization of spiritual victory. The author has grasped this proposition.

<h3>Income Tax Research Conference Began Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>188 Representatives Attended, Discussion Scheduled to Continue This Afternoon</p>
<p>The Income Tax Practical Problems Research Conference convened by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce opened at 2:00 PM yesterday. Members of the Income Tax Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, including Weng Zhizhu, Director of the Shanghai Office of Income Tax Liang Hejun, Accountant Xu Yongzuo, representatives from various local Chambers of Commerce, and guild representatives, totaling 188 individuals, attended. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Conference Proceedings</p>
<p>The meeting was called to order at 2:00 PM. First, Yan E-sheng, Secretary of the Chamber of Commerce, reported that a total of 195 representatives had registered for the Research Conference. These representatives included those from the Chambers of Commerce of Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Wuxian, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Changshu, Qingpu, Kunshan, Shaoxing, Wujin, Jiaxing, Shanghai, and other twelve Chambers of Commerce, the Nanjing Commercial Tax Regulations Research Association, the Wusong and Nanshi sub-offices affiliated with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, 107 guilds, and five store members, totaling 127 units. It was then requested to nominate five individuals for the Research Conference Presidium. Qian Sunqing, Wang Jiean, Gu Sumin, Shi Chunshan, and a representative from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce were nominated to form the Presidium. The opening ceremony was then officially held, and after the ceremony, the Chairman delivered the opening address, followed by addresses from Liang Hejun and Weng Zhizhu, and then an address from Accountant Xu.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address</p>
<p>Jin Runxiang, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative in the Presidium, delivered the opening address, stating, "Today is the day of the opening ceremony of the Income Tax Research Conference. I would like to briefly explain the origins of the Chamber's initiative to establish this Research Conference. As the world evolves, all matters become increasingly complex and specialized, and so does the tax system. Merchants engaged in commerce are not inherently familiar with national tax laws, and even minor errors or omissions in procedures may result in penalties. Therefore, the payment of customs duties is typically entrusted to customs brokers, who are experienced and proficient. While entrusting agents may incur some expenses, the procedures are significantly simplified. However, customs duties are indirect taxes, and thus the method of entrusting customs brokers for payment can be applied. As for direct taxes such as business tax, because they are based on the amount of business income, the amount of tax payable is related to the business secrets of a store, and it is no longer possible to entrust others to handle it. Therefore, today, every word and sentence of the tax law should be regarded by merchants as matters closely related to their business, and they must not be as indifferent as before. I still remember that before the implementation of the current Stamp Tax Law on September 1, 1935, the Chamber, because its regulations were different from before, was deeply concerned that merchants would not be able to fully understand it, and had convened a meeting of various industries to study it before the deadline. Now, two years have passed, and there are still many merchants who have not conducted a widespread and in-depth study, and even have not read the tax law provisions. Whenever they need to know how much a certain draft should be stamped, they temporarily inquire by telephone to the Chamber, or even guess blindly, resulting in investigations, detentions, and penalties that inevitably occur from time to time. All of these can be avoided, but merchants themselves delay and make mistakes. Although the stamp tax is a relatively trivial direct tax, it has a history of more than twenty years since its implementation in the early years of the Republic of China. Merchants should have developed the habit of paying taxes, and the provisions are relatively simple and do not have profound meanings. Even when it is applied, they are still at a loss, not to mention the income tax, which is a recent event. Merchants are not familiar with the tax payment procedures, and the matter involves cost accounting, which is almost twice as complicated as the stamp tax, which is based on the amount of the tax. Therefore, in view of the past, the Chamber intends to prepare merchants in advance, so there is the opening of the "Income Tax Research Conference." Also, because the Chamber has the task of leading merchants to jointly study the advantages and disadvantages of the tax system, the scope of those who come to the conference to study is not limited to representatives of various industries in the city. All Chambers of Commerce on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines are welcome to send representatives to participate. Fortunately, all parties recognize that the implementation of the income tax is of utmost importance to the business community, and those who send personnel to participate in the research are very enthusiastic, which is a testament to the vigorous efforts of our business community. The Chamber is very fortunate in this regard, and Accountant Xu Yongzuo is willing to sacrifice his valuable business time to preside over the conference and study matters every day, which is especially enthusiastic for public welfare and commendable. The Chamber and the listeners express their deep gratitude to him. In addition, the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance, as the head of the tax collection, also came to the conference today to provide sincere guidance, which is especially the compass for today's researchers. The Chamber and the listeners can all obtain many valuable insights and should express their honor and gratitude."</p>
<p>Liang's Address</p>
<p>㊀ Liang Hejun, Director of the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance, stated, "Distinguished representatives, I am deeply honored to be able to participate in this research conference today with the leaders of Chambers of Commerce from various places. All the taxes in our country in the past were indirect taxes, and the income tax is a direct tax. Why does our country want to implement the direct tax of income tax? Simply put, it can be said that from the perspective of the country, the income tax is a national crisis tax. Although the term "national crisis tax" does not exist in the financial science of various countries, in 1798, when Britain and France were at war, Britain began to implement the income tax. The United States also created and implemented it during the Civil War for wartime finance. In addition, Germany, France, and Russia all implemented it during wartime. We all know what a serious situation our country is currently in. We also know that the largest source of revenue for our government is the salt tax and customs duties. However, in times of national crisis, people will not increase their consumption of salt, and the salt tax will certainly not increase. As for customs duties, it is painful to say that in peacetime, for every extra point of customs duties collected, we shed an extra point of blood and sweat. Therefore, the increase in customs duties is not rationalized. Moreover, when a national crisis occurs, whether there will be difficulties in transportation and whether foreign goods can come as smoothly as in peacetime are all problems. Then, customs duties are certainly more unreliable in times of national crisis, let alone an increase in revenue. Everyone can understand the seriousness and dangerousness of the environment our country is currently in. In this autumn of crisis, the significance of the country's implementation of the income tax is not difficult to understand. Therefore, in times of crisis, the income tax is the largest source of tax revenue for the government. After the crisis passes, it is also the only good tax system, because the first is that the method of taxation is absolutely fair and equal. In fact, we pay more tax for more income. In theory, it can also cultivate the concept of patriotism among the people. In the past, the government had plans to implement the income tax for a long time, but because of property registration, population statistics, etc., there were too many things to do, and it could not be implemented for a while. Now, the environment is becoming more and more dangerous, so this good tax that can cope with the dangerous environment has to be resolutely implemented. The country is our country, and it is our responsibility to serve the country. Paying a share of taxes to the country is fulfilling the obligation of the people. Supporting the income tax is supporting the country. However, it is not easy to promote it if we do not understand the content of the tax system. Therefore, starting today, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce is presiding over the meeting here. I dare say that the results of the research will have a great impact on our country. I hope that all the representatives present will conduct in-depth research and give us as much guidance as possible." ㊁ Weng Zhizhu, a member of the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance, stated, "Regarding the significance of the income tax, Director Liang has already explained it in detail just now, so I will not repeat it. However, I have a few reports. When the financial conference was held in 1934, I felt that there was no way out of the entire financial problem in China. Subsequently, the conference decided on three steps: 1. Abolish miscellaneous taxes and levies, 2. Determine local budgets, 3. Consolidate old taxes, 4. Promote good taxes. At that time, I deeply believed that in order to improve the national economy and put finance on track, it would not be possible to achieve anything without following this approach. It has been two years and six months since then, and although there has been no significant effect, there has also been a considerable amount of progress. It is estimated that the result of abolishing miscellaneous taxes and levies is about 55 million yuan. The budgets of various places, except for the three northeastern provinces, Xinjiang, and other places that are in fact difficult, have been completed in more than 1,300 counties. Now, we should handle the work of promoting the good tax of income tax. The income tax is a tax that is generally practiced in various countries. In the beginning, it is always felt to be difficult. The national education of our country is relatively shallow, the statistics of various industries are still incomplete, and the accounting systems are different. Difficulties are inevitable. Fortunately, the government is striving to standardize and rationalize the tax laws and collection procedures. On the one hand, the people hope to abolish miscellaneous taxes and levies, and on the other hand, they should do their best to support and promote the good tax of income tax. Although the income tax law in our country is not the best law in modern countries, I firmly believe that after a considerable process, there will be considerable progress. This depends on the joint discussion and contribution of opinions from various industries, and the government is happy to accept them."</p>
<p>Research Steps</p>
<p>After Director Liang finished his address, Accountant Xu Yongzuo reported on the Chamber's initiation process and the subsequent research steps. It was decided to divide it into four days: the first day to study income from profitable businesses, the second day to study income from salaries and remuneration, the third day to study income from securities deposits, and the fourth day to study the relationship between income tax and accounting. At the same time, the Chamber of Commerce and Accountant Xu presented ten lectures on income tax and accounting, as well as a copy of the provisional regulations and implementation rules on the spot. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM and announced that it would continue at 2:00 PM on the 21st.</p>
<h3>Bankers Association Held Executive Committee Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Discussed Income Tax Payment in Detail, Requested Amendment of Unworkable Points</p>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Bankers Association held an executive committee meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday to discuss the income tax payment issues raised by the subcommittee. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Subcommittee Listened to Report</p>
<p>The matter of the banking industry paying income tax on deposit interest has been discussed several times in the past, and there are basically no problems. However, for the sake of prudence, the collection procedure needs to be studied in detail. After several consultations by the income tax subcommittee, it has been decided to send Cai Chengxin of the Bank of China and Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers Association, to the Shanghai Office of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance to meet with Director Liang Hejun to discuss the procedures for collecting income tax on banking cases (only the banking industry, the previous report that it was the banking and money industry was a misrepresentation). At the same time, in order to be simple and complete, a new form will be formulated and handled. On the 19th (the day before yesterday) at 5:00 PM, the industry subcommittee specially convened a meeting to listen to the reports of Lin and Cai. More than ten representatives from fifteen banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, attended. After discussion, it was decided to submit the discussion points to the Executive Committee for handling.</p>
<p>Four Important Points Handled Separately</p>
<p>The Executive Committee meeting was held at the Association's office at 5:00 PM yesterday. All fifteen Executive Committee members attended. Chairman Chen Guangfu first asked Lin Kanghou to report, and then discussed the various points raised by the subcommittee on the collection of income tax, and discussed them in detail. The main points were summarized as follows: ㊀ For points that are no longer problematic, such as interest on government bonds, they should be paid in accordance with the regulations and notified for handling. ㊁ For points that are still in doubt, the Executive Committee should submit them to the Legislative Yuan for interpretation. ㊂ For points that cannot be handled, the Executive Committee should submit them to the Legislative Yuan for amendment. ㊃ Points that are not subject to tax, such as deposits between banks, can be exempt from tax. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>American Officials and侨 in Shanghai Celebrated Roosevelt's Re-election Yesterday</h3>
<p>Holiday for a Day, Flags Flown to Celebrate, Grand Banquet Held for 500 People</p>
<p>US President Roosevelt was re-elected. The inauguration ceremony was held yesterday afternoon (Shanghai time was 1:00 AM this morning). In addition to the US Consulate and the Detective Office taking a day off, flags were flown to celebrate. The American Association and the American Chamber of Commerce jointly organized American officials and citizens in Shanghai to hold a grand banquet at the American Association on Fuzhou Road at 11:30 PM last night to celebrate. More than 500 people, including US Consul General Gauss, Detective Hill Meek, and Commander of the US Marine Corps in Shanghai, Paras, attended. During the banquet, Roosevelt's inaugural address was listened to live on the radio, and the celebration continued all night, adjourning at about 1:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3>He Rang Arrives in Shanghai to Discuss Sino-Siamese Trade</h3>
<p>Fire Rice Mills Decline, Need for Improvement in Chinese Goods Sold to Siam</p>
<p>He Rang, Secretary to our Commercial Commissioner stationed in Siam and concurrently Committee Member of the Siamese Chinese Chamber of Commerce, recently came to Shanghai from Siam to inspect the latest situation of domestic commerce. Yesterday afternoon, he also visited various domestic goods factories in the city to work on improving communication between domestic goods and Siam. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency paid a special visit to He at his hotel yesterday to inquire about the latest situation of Sino-Siamese trade. According to him, Sino-Siamese relations have always been friendly. After our country's delegation to Siam for inspection, the relationship has become even closer. There are a large number of Chinese people living in Siam, more than 2.5 million, with a long history, and most of them are engaged in commerce. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the universal economic downturn around the world, there has been no significant development. Siam is a rice-producing country in the world. Many overseas Chinese in Siam are engaged in the rice industry, namely the so-called "fire rice mills." There are more than 60 of them in Bangkok, the capital of Siam, and often hundreds of smaller fire rice mills scattered in the countryside. Only one is run by foreigners. However, due to the increase in the number of fire rice mills in the countryside last year, the grain produced was not enough for work. In addition, the import tax on foreign rice from Guangdong Province increased, and the sale of Siamese rice to China not only became unprofitable but also incurred losses. Therefore, the transaction was minimal. In the past, 45% of it was shipped to Guangdong via Hong Kong. As a result, the specialized fire rice mills run by overseas Chinese have declined. The second special product of Siam is teak wood. Last year, the business was very good. There should be no problem with the sale of domestic goods to Siam, as there are many overseas Chinese in Siam who are happy to use domestic goods. During my return to China this time, I visited domestic goods companies yesterday and was very pleased to see the progress of the products from various factories. Furthermore, when the Nanyang Inspection Group went to Siam for inspection last year, a grand exhibition was held, and domestically produced products had a good impression on overseas Chinese. Therefore, the future of domestic goods is bright. However, what must be noted is to find ways to reduce costs and make the goods more refined, so as to compete with Japanese goods. Although Siamese business has developed recently, it is still in the minority. Japanese businesses in Siam are working very hard and are very accommodating in their business, such as paying the price of goods in one month, and using their low prices as a selling point. Although most of the consumers are also overseas Chinese, their encroachment on the market is worth noting. In the future development of Sino-Siamese trade, the development of transportation is also an important measure. There are currently no direct shipping lines between China and Siam, and the convenience of cargo transportation is not as good as that of Japan. In order to develop the domestic goods business, overseas Chinese in Siam have organized the Siamese Chinese Domestic Goods Company, and a preparatory committee has been established and is actively underway. Mr. He will stay in Shanghai for another day or two before returning to Siam.</p>
<h3>Five German Medical Experts Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>Serving as Professors at Tongji University and Physicians at Municipal Hospitals</p>
<p>According to the Continental Press, Dr. Weng Zhilong, President of Tongji University, stated yesterday that five German medical experts will arrive in Shanghai soon to serve as professors at Tongji University and physicians at the new Shanghai Municipal Hospital. The surnames of these five people have not yet been announced. Their travel expenses and salaries are borne by the German government. They include experts in surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, pathology, and dermatology, all of whom are well-known in the German medical community. It is understood that Tongji University recently reached an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau that the hospital will be run by the university, so that medical students in the university have the opportunity to experiment. Therefore, President Weng consulted with Mr. Kriebel, the German Consul-General in Shanghai, and the German government provided these five medical experts. As for the hospital building, it has been completed for several months. It is now planned to officially open in March of this year. It could have been earlier, but due to the strike in the American shipping industry, the ordered equipment could not be transported for a while, so it had to be postponed slightly. However, the outpatient department of the hospital has already opened, and about 60 people are treated every day.</p>
<h3>Wang Chonghui Stays in Shanghai to Treat Nasal Disease</h3>
<p>Will Take Office in Beijing Immediately Upon Receiving Orders from the Government</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wang Chonghui, the newly appointed member of the National Government, came to Shanghai from Beijing a few days ago to continue treating his nasal disease. There is no definite date for when he will go to Beijing to take office. According to Wang, he is staying in Shanghai to seek medical treatment and wash his nose because his nasal disease has not yet been cured. The appointment of the National Government member has not yet arrived. He has decided to go to Beijing to take office after receiving the order.</p>
<h3>Cheng Tianguo Went to Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>To Visit Wu and Set a Date for Taking Office</p>
<p>Liu Weizhi, Political Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, has been transferred to serve as a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government and Director of the Construction Department, which has been approved by the 297th regular meeting of the Executive Yuan. He should be removed from his current position, and Cheng Tianguo should be appointed as Political Vice Minister. Mr. Cheng came to Shanghai at the beginning of the month for official business. After finishing, he took the early express train to Beijing yesterday morning to visit Wu Dingchang, Minister of Industry, and then set a date for taking the oath of office.</p>

After getting off the train, he went to the New Asia Hotel on Tiantong Road for a short rest. Then, at 8:00, he visited Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council, and had a long talk.</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Attended to His Duties as Usual Yesterday</h3>
<p>Song Ziwen, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council and Chairman of the Bank of China, returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou the night before. At 10:00 yesterday morning, he went to the China Construction Bank and the Bank of China to work as usual. He met with Chen Xing, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, and inquired in detail about the recent financial situation.</p>

<h3>Chinese Cultural Construction Association Sends Telegram Urging Punishment of Rebels, Suppression of Bandits, and Resistance Against the Enemy</h3>
<p>Telegrams from All Circles Are Also Recorded</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Chinese Cultural Construction Association sent a telegram yesterday, which stated: "The Central News Agency forwards to all newspapers, schools, and organizations across the country: The most urgent task for the country at present is unity. Only unity can resist foreign enemies, and only unity can plan construction. This is not only the case for our country today, but also the path that must be taken for the revival of nations in ancient and modern China and abroad. Therefore, today, anyone who plots secession and undermines unity, regardless of their reasons, is a public enemy of the nation. Zhang Xueliang, the chief culprit of the Shaanxi Incident, has committed countless crimes that harm the country. The people of the country have long found it difficult to forgive him lightly. Our Central Government has been broad-minded and hoped that he would reform himself. Over the past ten years, we have been accommodating and trusting him, and hoping that he would serve the country. This is obvious to everyone. Even after the Xi'an rebellion, we still thought of politely sending the leader back to Beijing, reducing the sentence and pardoning him. We have been benevolent and righteous to the utmost, and there is no further criticism. However, for more than ten days, the troops have been resisting in corners, and the villains have been disobeying orders. The atmosphere of disobedience has filled the Northwest. Who is responsible for this and caused this? The Northwest is a base for national defense. Our Central Government has been doing its best to build it in the past three or four years, developing transportation and managing industries. The initial foundation has fortunately been roughly laid, but it has been ruined by this upheaval. The fundamental foundation has been completely destroyed. Now, if we want to restore the old appearance, we don't know how many more days and how much more energy it will take. Zhang Xueliang, as a person who is heavily responsible for suppressing bandits, has actually made the absurd move of colluding with and surrendering to bandits. He verbally advocates resisting Japan, but in reality, he is destroying the foundation of national defense against the enemy. Ordinary people only know that his kidnapping of the commander-in-chief is the greatest crime, but they don't know that colluding with bandits to plot secession, surrendering to bandits to destroy construction, undermining unity, and destroying national defense are directly criminals of the anti-enemy movement and moths of national salvation work. If this can be forgiven, what cannot be forgiven? If this can be pardoned, what cannot be pardoned? The failure of the country is due to the evil of officials. The ancient teachings are clear and should be taken as a lesson. If we still give preferential treatment to such evil officials, it means that we value private feelings, distance ourselves from public opinion, worry about mutinous soldiers and rebellious generals, and despise laws and disciplines. If we follow this line of reasoning, what generals will not be afraid to rebel and what soldiers will not be afraid to mutiny? In addition, the red atmosphere in the Northwest is gradually spreading, the people are displaced, and industries are declining. If we do not plan to sit and wait for it to spread, I am afraid that in the future, we will not only have no soldiers to use, but also no food to raise. This association believes that the right way to save the country today is nothing more than three things: Punish rebels to clarify discipline, suppress red bandits to stabilize people's livelihood, and strengthen national power to resist foreign enemies. If the national policy is highly suspended and resolutely implemented, unifying to resist insults will be achieved in no time. If we are still indecisive and hesitant, then before the discussions are settled, the red bandits will cross the Tongguan and move east, and the pseudo-bandits will definitely invade the Sui border. May I ask you gentlemen who are in power, how will you talk about suppression and how will you talk about resistance? North of the Yellow River, will it not be sent to be the second Spain? What will the future generations say? The members of this association look at the difficult times and are extremely angry and in pain, unaware that their words are so urgent. You gentlemen have high aspirations and broad vision and must have true knowledge and insights. We hope that you will generously express your opinions and hope to move the Central Government's hearing. In this critical moment, we look forward to it very much and pray very much. The Chinese Cultural Construction Association and its branches in various provinces and cities jointly kowtow. The New Sound News Agency stated: The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation jointly sent a telegram to the Central Government yesterday, which stated: The Central Party Department of Nanjing, the National Government, and the Military Commission, please note: Last year's Xi'an Incident caused national grief and anger. The chief culprit should be punished according to the law to strengthen discipline and thank the people of the country. However, the government's order stated that because he escorted the chairman safely back to Beijing, he was given preferential treatment and ordered to make up for his crimes and cover up his past mistakes. The Central Government was broad-minded, benevolent, and gracious, hoping to preserve national strength and cultivate people's livelihood. However, Yang Hucheng and others not only did not know how to be grateful and repay kindness, but instead resisted orders, claimed troops, colluded with bandits, and made trouble, causing the red flames that were about to be extinguished to spread again, and the disaster victims after the robbery were heavily wounded. Harming the people and the country, the world is heartbroken. We humbly ask the Central Government to launch a large-scale crusade, severely suppress and eliminate them, so as to curb the chaos and boost the country's prestige. We cannot help but wait for orders with great urgency. The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association and the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Silk Weaving Federation jointly kowtow. The Municipal Security Public Team Party Affairs Guidance Committee sent a telegram to the Central Government yesterday, which stated: The Central Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, please note: The Xi'an Incident caused national anger and hatred. Zhang Xueliang was the real culprit. Our Central Government was broad-minded and made peaceful decisions, repeatedly giving preferential treatment to give the barbarians a way to reform themselves. Unexpectedly, the jackal's nature has become habitual, and they have not repented. Not only did they not know how to be grateful and repay the country, but they also asked Zhang to fabricate secrets and order his subordinates to occupy the territory and make trouble. Yang colluded with bandits and communists and resisted the troops, causing the initial form of unification to be frustrated. The fathers and elders in Guanzhong suffered from the red flames. If they are treated with tolerance, it will only cause the disease of paralysis. Therefore, we telegram and ask the meeting to make a decisive decision, quickly bring Zhang to justice to maintain national law, and quickly suppress Yang and other troops to quell the source of chaos. We are in a state of panic and anxiety. The Party Affairs Guidance Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Security Public Team of the Chinese Kuomintang kowtows, 哿印.</p>
<h3>The Strike Wave in the National Pharmaceutical Industry in the French Concession is Becoming Increasingly Serious Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Attitude of the French Municipal Council is Extremely Tough; More Than 100 Trade Associations Declare Resistance; The Municipal Government Has Sent Personnel to Negotiate with the French Consulate</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, the strike wave in the national pharmaceutical industry in the French Concession is becoming increasingly serious due to the French Municipal Council's lack of concession. In addition to declaring assistance, 160 trade associations in the city, including the salted fish industry, have also petitioned the authorities to conduct negotiations quickly. It is reported that the municipal government has sent Secretary Geng Jiaji to conduct negotiations with the French Consul General. The Pharmaceutical Industry Association is deeply afraid that someone will take the opportunity to sabotage during the strike period, and has formed a maintenance team to maintain order. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Continued Strike is Becoming Serious</p>
<p>The national pharmacies in the French Concession, such as Darenhang, Guangshengtang, and Taishantang, have not yet had their water and electricity restored, so they are still on strike. Yesterday, the French Municipal Council also sent personnel accompanied by detectives to various pharmacies to prevent the posting of strike notices, and stated that strikes to resist donations would affect public security and would be arrested by the police. The person in charge of the Municipal Council also declared to the outside world that the drug tax was approved by the Board of Directors and had been notified for collection long ago, and there was no possibility of cancellation. As for the move to cut off water and electricity, it was out of necessity because the pharmacies in the concession were on strike to resist donations. If the pharmacies in the concession can abide by the regulations, they can be restored at any time. There is no indication of concession, which is why the situation is becoming more and more serious.</p>
<p>The Municipal Government Sends Personnel to Negotiate</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency went to the Social Affairs Bureau to interview Wu Hengru, the head of the Second Section of the Bureau. According to him, regarding the French Municipal Council's collection of drug taxes and cutting off the water and electricity of national pharmacies such as Guangshengtang, the Bureau immediately forwarded it to the Municipal Government after receiving the report from the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association and conducted negotiations with the French Municipal Council. It has also been heard that the Municipal Government has sent Secretary Geng Jiaji to conduct negotiations with the French Consulate.</p>
<p>The Second Special District Jointly Requests the Withdrawal of the New Donation</p>
<p>The Citizens' Union of the Second Special District also held an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss ways to promote the resolution of this case. Tao Ran and Cen Zhiliang from the Pharmaceutical Industry Association were sent to attend and report. At the same time, representatives from the salted fish, pepper, clothing, fresh pork, and other industry associations also attended the meeting and demanded strict negotiations. It was decided to send a letter to the French Municipal Council requesting the cancellation of the initial donation and the prompt restoration of water and electricity for those that have been cut off, and that no more power outages be used in the future to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry Association Forms a Maintenance Team</p>
<p>The Pharmaceutical Industry Association is deeply afraid that unscrupulous elements may take the opportunity to cause trouble during the strike period, which may affect order. It has specially selected twelve cadres to form a maintenance team, which is divided into six districts, with two people in each district. Starting today, they will go to various striking pharmacies to serve as comfort and discipline inspectors. The association has also scheduled to hold the 17th Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees at 2:00 pm tomorrow to discuss prudent coping measures.</p>
<p>Various Trade Associations Require Three Items</p>
<p>More than 160 trade associations in the city, including the salted fish industry, flower and tree industry, Qinglan cloth dyeing industry, clothing industry, fresh pork selling industry, leather making industry, construction industry, Fuyang printing and bleaching industry, shoe industry, hoe industry, homespun cloth industry, gray cloth dyeing industry, rayon industry, noodle restaurant industry, south goods industry, bamboo industry, fresh pork processing industry, candle industry, thermos bottle industry, tanned leather processing industry, fresh medicine industry, matte yarn dyeing industry, tofu industry, cotton ginning industry, barber industry, and kitchen industry, jointly submitted a letter to the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday to assist the national pharmaceutical industry and requested that serious negotiations be conducted with the French Municipal Council as soon as possible, requesting: ㊀ Restore water and electricity unconditionally on the same day, ㊁ Retain the right to claim compensation for strike losses, ㊂ Guarantee that the same situation will not occur again in the entire district in the future, so as to maintain commerce and calm public anger.</p>
<p>Issue a Declaration of Unanimous Assistance</p>
<p>More than 160 trade associations, including the salted fish industry, also issued a declaration to provide unanimous assistance. The original text reads: The French Municipal Council often uses cutting off water and electricity as a tool to coerce shops to achieve its extraction. This association, etc., has repeatedly received petitions from members in the district requesting relief, and has long been preparing to protest seriously to seek relief from this pain. However, due to the bleak market conditions and the sorrow of the people, if the protest is ineffective, it will inevitably be followed by practical actions. We are sincerely afraid that it will be difficult to recover once it is launched and will heavily burden our critically ill commerce. Today, the national pharmacies in the district, due to opposition to the arbitrary donations imposed by France and the oppression of power outages, are motivated by righteous indignation and endure the greatest pain and implement a full strike. This association, etc., based on the righteous position, expresses its most sincere sympathy. If the French Municipal Council can carefully weigh the gains and losses and clearly understand the difficulties of commerce, and restore the cut-off electricity and fire on the same day, it will be a great fortune for both parties. If it is necessary to adhere to one end and drive it to the end, this association, etc., should follow the request of the members in the district and stand up as a backing. Without achieving the goal, we will fight to the end. This is hereby declared.</p>
<p>Notice from the French Concession Authorities</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tianfa Police Station sent a notice asking for publication. Here is a verbatim copy: Notice from the French Concession Authorities to National Pharmacists: National pharmacists in the French Concession have recently been instigating a wave of opposition to the authorities' collection of illegal taxes, and have been issuing reports and printing declarations in various ways. It has been found that the newspapers and declarations contain many destructive and inflammatory properties, and the absurdity of the content is self-defeating. ㊀ The pharmacist's license is a completely legal license that has been formally adopted by the Municipal Council in 1936 and 1937. ㊁ The tax rate for this license is extremely low, ranging from 10 yuan to 25 yuan per year (so only 8.3 yuan to 2.8 yuan per month), far less than that paid by foreign pharmacists (from 23 yuan to 48 yuan). ㊂ Regarding the suspension of electricity, the taxes levied by the concession authorities on residents are originally commensurate with the benefits of the public facilities they receive. If a portion of the residents bear the cost of all public facilities and allow the remaining residents to be exempted from obligations and violate the responsibilities they tacitly assume to the administrative authorities, how can it be allowed? ㊃ The French Municipal Council has extremely demonstrated its gentle attitude and has agreed to reduce the first year's (1936) license donation by 50%. Since it cannot go any further, as for the wave instigated by a small number of people, the French Concession authorities cannot tolerate it and will punish it in accordance with the law and maintain public order. It is the responsibility of the police station to take all measures to maintain it, so that the freedom of work can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Service Between Shanghai and Jiujiang and Nanchang is Open</h3>
<p>Long-distance telephone service to nine provinces and ten cities is about to be completed. After the communication between Shanghai and Guling, the Shanghai-Jiujiang line and the Shanghai-Nanchang line have been opened. The Shanghai-Xun line is 2.9 yuan for the special zone and 2.6 yuan for the urban area every three minutes. The Shanghai-Gan line is 3.1 yuan for the special zone and 2.8 yuan for the urban area.

<h3>Patrick Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mr. Patrick, the representative of the British Export Credit Guarantee Bureau, returned to Shanghai on the 18th due to the urgent matters of the important officials in Shanghai and officially began his work. In recent days, he has met with British business leaders to consult on the industrial, commercial and financial situation in Shanghai. According to his assistant, Mr. O'Lae, Mr. Patrick has not yet decided on his itinerary to visit various places. It was originally planned to go north first, but since Ambassador Xing Xuchen has already met in Beijing, the trip to Tianjin can be postponed.</p>
<h3>A Veteran Writer From Japan, Shimazaki, Passed Through Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon on His Way Back Home</h3>
<p>Yamamoto Sanemitsu Accompanied the Ship</p>
<p>Shimazaki Toson, a veteran writer representing Japan at the World PEN Congress, passed through Shanghai at 6:00 yesterday morning with his wife, Shizuko, on the Japanese post office ship "Haruna Maru" on his way back home. Yamamoto Sanemitsu, president of the Japanese Reconstruction Society, who was staying in Shanghai, went to the ship to welcome him and invited Shimazaki to land and visit the city center. He only stayed in Shanghai for a few hours and then returned to the country on the original ship at 1:00 pm. Mr. Yamamoto also returned to Japan on the ship. It is reported that Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi originally planned to invite Mr. Shimazaki for a talk, but due to time constraints, Mr. Shimazaki was unable to stay in Shanghai to pay his respects, and has asked someone to politely decline to Mr. Kong on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Self-Employed Income Tax is Calculated and Taxed Every Six Months</h3>
<p>Approved by the Income Tax Office</p>
<p>Shen Liren, a chartered accountant at the Shanghai Chinese Accountants' Office, recently represented his self-employed clients. According to the provisions of Article 7 of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, "Those whose income is irregular or temporary shall calculate and tax the amount of income for each month," and Article 26, Paragraph 2 of the Implementing Rules, "Second-class income shall be paid monthly," it seems not very fair. He specially submitted a document to the Shanghai Income Tax Office requesting to change the calculation of taxes based on the total income for one year, and to pay every six months or one year. He has now received a reply stating that from January 1 of this year, the total settlement will be made every six months, and the average amount of income for each month will be taxed.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau Ordered to Close Completely</h3>
<p>Zhang Yi Once Served as General Manager, The Statement of Temporarily Maintaining the Status Quo is Incorrect</p>
<p>The China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau was previously ordered by the National-owned China Merchants Bureau to be completely closed and suspended by the end of 1936 in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Communications. Regarding the recent situation of the Inland River Bureau, according to the person in charge of the China Merchants Bureau, when the Bureau was ordered to close the Inland River Bureau by the deadline, the Inland River Bureau reported that it was based on the request of merchant Zhang Yi Zeng that after the Inland River Bureau was closed, the merchant would rent the ships to operate, etc. At that time, the closure procedures of the Inland River Bureau were not ready, and the Bureau reported to the Ministry of Communications that the deadline for the closure of the Inland River Bureau was extended to January 15, 1937. At the same time, the merchant's request to rent ships for operation was reported to the Ministry for approval. Later, the instruction was received to still order the complete closure and suspension, and the Zhang Yi Zeng rental of ships to continue navigation was not approved. The Bureau has ordered the Inland River Bureau to comply with the order. It is not true that Zhang Yi Zeng served as the general manager of the Inland River Bureau, and it is also reported that Zhang requested the Bureau to temporarily maintain the status quo of the Inland River Bureau, and was approved by Deputy Manager Shen of the Bureau, and it was decided to go to Beijing that night to request various sections from the Ministry, which are not true.</p>
<h3>The Shimazaki Couple</h3>
<h3>The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau Ordered Shipping Companies to Register Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Deadline is Approaching, Comply Quickly to Avoid Misunderstanding</p>
<p>In order to rectify the shipping industry, the Ministry of Communications specially formulated the Rules for Registration of Steamship Industry and promulgated and implemented them on December 9 last year. The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau also ordered the shipping industry under its jurisdiction to comply with the rules. Because it has been more than a month overdue, most shipping companies are waiting and watching. The Bureau specially issued a notice to all steamship companies and firms yesterday, ordering them to quickly apply for supplementary registration to avoid misunderstanding. Here is a special exploration of the original text of the notice: In order to announce the matter, the Rules for Registration of Steamship Industry have been promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Communications on November 9 last year, and the Bureau has also sent the rules to the Shanghai Steamship Industry Association and the Shanghai Inland River Steamship Industry Association for transfer to various steamship industries for compliance. In accordance with the provisions of Article 11 of the Rules, the deadline for supplementary registration for existing steamship companies and firms is six months from the date of promulgation of the Rules. It has been more than a month since the date of promulgation of the Rules, and various steamship companies and firms have not yet come to apply for supplementary registration. The deadline is approaching, and all existing steamship companies and firms should comply quickly to avoid misunderstanding. In addition to sending letters separately, this announcement is specially made for public knowledge.</p>
<h3>The Central Machine Factory Was Ordered to Prepare for Transfer</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan Meeting Decided to Transfer the Central Machine Factory of the Ministry of Industry to the Ministry of Railways for management. A reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about Lu Weipu, the preparatory director of the factory, yesterday, and was told that regarding the transfer, the order of the Ministry of Industry has been received, and the formal transfer can be made as soon as the Ministry of Railways sends personnel to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yang Feng Telegraphs Suiyuan Regarding Disaster Investigation Process</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association received a telegram from Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong reporting on the inspection and relief process, saying: To the esteemed Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association: Fen et al. departed from Xinghe, 180 li away, for Jining to investigate the disaster area of the county. One-fourth of the entire county is affected. The location is intertwined with Taolin. Relief workers investigating Taolin can also investigate Jining. The most severely affected war zone in Taolin is Honggeyuan, whose northeast is surrounded by overlapping mountains. Bandits and puppets from Shangdu, numbering four to five thousand, used airplanes and artillery for cover, fully armed, to invade and occupy the mountain peaks and launch fierce attacks downwards. The defending national army had only one company, and several hundred members of the public defense and service corps resolutely resisted in the trenches, day and night. One continuous stream of reinforcements arrived. Fortunately, there were weapons, and they were eventually able to repel the attackers. Three-fourths of the destroyed civilian houses and the Catholic church were also heavily damaged. Many people were displaced and have not returned. Relief friends set out in four groups. We stayed for one day and went to Taolin City to meet the county magistrate, then returned to Jining Zhuozishan, and returned to the province last night. After a brief rest for one day, we will go to Sui. This is the general situation of Bailin Temple, Great Temple, Wulanhua, Siziwang Banner, Wuchuan, and other places. The relief funds of 20,000 yuan have been remitted. The first batch of relief clothing has arrived in Ping, but has not yet arrived in Sui, which is too slow. Respectfully reported, Feng Xuefen and Yang Mingsheng kowtow. (Xinxin News Agency)</p>
<h3>Charity Organizations Relief Association to Raise 80,000 This Month</h3>
<p>Separate Letters Soliciting Donations from Various Organizations and Individuals</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Relief Association, after receiving a telegram from the association's Feng and Yang, stating that the disaster in Suiyuan was exceptionally tragic and that relief was urgently needed, immediately convened its third executive meeting and resolved to raise 80,000 yuan before the end of this month to remit to Sui for disaster relief and to save the affected people. In addition to appointing Qu Wenliu, Li Dachao, and other seven people to be responsible for soliciting donations, yesterday, it sent a reply to various organizations and individual members who had already pledged donations but had not yet paid, as well as those who had not yet pledged donations, stating: Respected Sirs, At the third executive meeting of this association on the 16th of this month, the relief funds of this association were discussed and it was resolved that those who have already pledged donations but have not yet paid will be sent letters and representatives will be dispatched to collect them in installments and that all funds will be collected before the end of this month. Those who have not pledged donations are requested to determine the amount of their donations, record them in the register, and send them to the relevant parties. Respectfully, we hope that you, for the relief funds of this association, will indicate the amount of donations, whether pledged or solicited, before the end of this month. We eagerly await your response.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales for All Gangs Increase Sharply, Domestic Flour Merchants All Profit</h3>
<p>Years of Losses Slightly Compensated. Two Batches of Foreign Wheat Continue Loading to Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that since the sales of flour from the Northern and Southern gangs have increased sharply, the number of vehicles in each factory has recovered and production has been stepped up. Regarding the raw materials for flour production, each factory, in addition to setting up shops in domestic production areas to purchase and use, has also ordered seven ships of foreign wheat from Australia, Canada, Chicago, and other places, totaling more than 53,000 tons, which arrived in Shanghai the night before last and were unloaded and stored in various warehouses. Goods are picked up with a single ticket. According to the designated distribution method, they are transferred to Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Danyang, Nanjing, and other domestic manufacturers for use. Dagong News Agency reporters learned that since the September 18th Incident, after the Northeast market was seized by invaders, the flour industry in our country suffered a setback, and losses have been significant over the years. Those with a shortage of capital have experienced economic stagnation, closure, and business suspension. Those with slightly thicker capital also felt difficulties in turnover under this blow. Fortunately, our country had a bumper harvest last year, and overseas wheat-producing areas were barren, and prices rose sharply. Japanese flour mills could not grind due to cost reasons, so our country's flour mills took the opportunity to rise. In the Northern and Southern gangs markets that were once seized, a large amount of Chinese flour was transported and sold, and the long-standing chronic diseases were healed. Therefore, most flour mills last year were profitable. Although past losses have not been fully recovered, there has been considerable compensation, and it is expected that there will be continued progress in the future.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Industry, People's Food Shops Solicit Donations for Airplanes</h3>
<p>Remaining Funds Are Being Collected and Handed Over</p>
<p>Shanghai City is raising funds to purchase airplanes to present to the government as a commemoration of Chairman Chiang's 50th birthday. The miscellaneous grains and oil cake industry raised 100,000 yuan to purchase one airplane. It is reported that donations have been received, including 6,000 yuan already paid by various rice shops in the Northern City, and another 6,000 yuan pledged. The vegetable industry has already paid 12,000 yuan, and another 12,000 yuan has been pledged. In addition, for free donations, various shops in the Southern City have contributed 11,000 yuan, and various shops in the Northern City have contributed 4,000 yuan. The remaining amount will be collected by various miscellaneous grains gangs, such as the fishermen's gang, the miscellaneous grains trade guild, the Cantonese Shenshoutang, the Zhenjiang gang Jiqitang, and the oil cake factory guild. This is being actively promoted.</p>

<h3>Fire at Medicinal Herb Warehouse in Huayuan Lane Causes Nearly 200,000 Yuan in Losses</h3>
<p>Warehouse Shared by Wan Maoxing and Tong Kang Two Medicine Stores. Fire Took Five Hours to Put Out. Rescue Was Extremely Difficult</p>
<p>At around 6 p.m. yesterday, a warehouse shared by Wan Maoxing and Tong Kang, two medicinal herb stores at No. 42 Huayuan Lane outside Dadongmen in the Southern City, suddenly caught fire. The fire spread rapidly. Although the firefighters tried their best to extinguish it, it had not been completely extinguished by around 11 p.m. It is estimated that the losses of the two stores are close to 200,000 yuan. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Shared Warehouse The address at No. 42 Huayuan Lane, Dadong Wharf Street outside Dadongmen in the Southern City, is an old-style mansion with a total of twelve spacious rooms upstairs and downstairs. The house is jointly leased by Wan Maoxing at No. 99 Xiangua Street inside Dadongmen and Tong Kang, a medicinal herb store at No. 99 Wangmiao North, Waixiangua Street, as a warehouse. It has been many years since then, and no accidents have occurred.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire Usually, each of the two stores sends five or six people to take turns guarding the warehouse every day. At 6 p.m. yesterday, all the guards in the warehouse left the warehouse for dinner. When they returned to the warehouse after dinner at 6:30 p.m., they suddenly found a fire in the warehouse, so they immediately alerted the fire brigade, and a fire engine was dispatched to rescue it. However, the fire was already out of control, and the alley was extremely narrow, making rescue extremely difficult. The firefighters had no choice but to urgently smash open the walls of Yucheng at No. 46 on the right and Xingfa at No. 40 on the left and shoot water from three sides.</p>
<p>Huge Losses When the reporter of this newspaper rushed to investigate, neighbors nearby claimed that the warehouse had been fully stocked with goods recently. When the fire broke out, no one on the left or right knew about it until the firefighters arrived and smashed the walls to shoot water. Therefore, as of 11 p.m., when this newspaper went to press, it had not been completely extinguished. It is estimated that the losses of the two stores in this fire are about 200,000 yuan. There are more than a thousand pieces of goods in the warehouse. Even the cheapest medicinal material is worth two or three thousand yuan. It is easy to imagine the price of other finer and more expensive items.</p>
<p>History of the Two Stores Wan Maoxing Medicine Store has been in business for more than 80 years and is one of the best in the Chinese medicine industry. It is said to be a joint venture established by shareholders, and the general manager is Zhuang Zhihong from Ningbo. Tong Kang Medicine Store has been established for 15 or 16 years and is a sole proprietorship established by Du Xianqing from Ningbo. Both stores have fire insurance for the jointly leased warehouse. Wan Maoxing is insured by Good Times Insurance Company, with an insured amount of more than 20,000 yuan. Tong Kang is insured by Siming Insurance Company, with an insured amount of only more than 10,000 yuan. The cause of the fire is currently under strict investigation by the police station in charge.</p>
<h3>Zhu Xinyuan's Abortion Leads to Illness</h3>
<p>Police File Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhu Xinyuan, a local woman residing at No. 15 Shanhai Pass Road, is 22 years old and works as a female worker in the Yihe Silk Factory in Dawang Temple. She has no husband. Because Zhu Xinyuan was unaccustomed to sleeping alone, she had an affair with Wu Landi from Shaoxing. She secretly became pregnant. Fearing that her mother, Zhu Chen, would find out, she paid 21 yuan to Yang Zhong from Zhenjiang at No. 215 Changping Road through her little sister Tan Cuidi to have an abortion in November last year. Although the fetus was aborted, Zhu Xinyuan became ill and became more and more serious. It was not until the 3rd of this month that her mother sent Zhu Xinyuan to Guangren Hospital, where it was confirmed that she was ill due to an abortion. She immediately reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which ordered detective Cui Jinyong to arrest Yang Zhong and send her to the First Special Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit against Yang Zhong and Zhu Xinyuan according to the law. Because Zhu was hospitalized for treatment, the hearing was postponed. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan stated that the defendant Zhu Xinyuan had not yet recovered and requested the court to question her at the hospital. Subsequently, Zhu Chen claimed that she was 48 years old, from Shanghai, and lived at No. 15 Shanhai Pass Road. Zhu Xinyuan is my biological daughter and works in the Qihe Silk Factory. At the beginning of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, she suddenly became ill. I didn't know it was because of an abortion at first, until recently, when I saw her illness getting worse, I sent her to the hospital and found out that it was caused by an abortion. When questioned, the defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Chen Maoxuan to appear in court to represent them. Judge Huang ruled that the case would be postponed for seven days, and it was also scheduled to go to Guangren Hospital at 3 p.m. yesterday to question Zhu Xinyuan's confession.</p>
<h3>Bravely Capturing Thieves, Shot by Thief</h3>
<p>Robbery in Sanliqiao, Pudong</p>
<p>Feng Zhen's home at No. 24 Jiandelili, Sanliqiao, West Pudong, was broken into by three thieves at 2 a.m. yesterday. One thief wearing gray cloth guarded the second door, while the other two thieves went upstairs. One thief wearing blue cloth held a pistol and warned Feng's wife not to make a sound, while the thief wearing black cloth robbed the house. They stole two gold rings and a呢大衣 and went to Zhoujia Street through the back alley. This was heard by Xu Jiufu at No. 43 next door, who bravely grabbed an iron rod and chased after them. The thief shot him in the upper part of his right knee. At that time, the Nanmatou Police Station learned of the incident and immediately dispatched patrol officers to arrest the thieves but failed. They immediately sent the injured Xu Jiufu to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. They also found a four-inch pistol bullet on the ground and sent it to the Kuangqiao Police Station for safekeeping, awaiting the arrest of the thieves for investigation.</p>
<h3>Sheng Yuchang Accused of Issuing Bad Checks</h3>
<p>Court Summons Unserved. Check Address and Resend</p>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, the grandson of the former Qing Dynasty's Palace Guardian Sheng Xingsun, previously issued a check for 5,632.50 yuan from Shanghai Continental Bank dated December 15, 25th year, to Wu Zhaoji and Wu Li, Cantonese from Sihui, and crossed out the payer's name on the check, so the check had to be collected with a guarantee from another bank. However, Wu and others did not have a bank to deal with, so they handed the check to lawyer Xu Shihao for collection. Unexpectedly, when it was due, it was rejected. Wu and others then hired Rong Zhenlong as their agent to file a lawsuit against Sheng Yuchang in the First Special Court for issuing bad checks, requesting punishment in accordance with Article 136 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and attached a civil lawsuit requesting the recovery of the check amount. The court immediately issued a summons and sent it to Sheng at No. 22 Central Building, Jiujiang Road, as listed by the plaintiff. However, the place was an empty house, so it could not be served. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Second Criminal Court for questioning. The plaintiff's lawyer explained the process and stated that the defendant's address was B22 Central Building and requested that it be sent again. The court approved and ordered a change of date for the hearing.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Li Jichuan Accused of Seduction</h3>
<p>Verdict on the 25th</p>
<p>When lawyer Li Jichuan lived in Yongfengfang, North Sichuan Road, he had an ambiguous relationship with Qu Yinsong, the wife of his neighbor Feng Weichen from Guangdong. Feng initially lacked evidence and endured in silence. Recently, after Li moved away, Qu's temptation became even greater, and she did not return home all night. After Feng investigated and confirmed the matter, he hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Li in the First Special District Court for seduction. A hearing has already been held, as reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Pan Zhenyang opened the court for a continued hearing. The defendant's defense lawyer, Chen Wenshuo, still requested that the hearing be closed to the public, but the court did not consider it necessary and did not approve the request. Then, the plaintiff Feng Weichen was questioned. He testified that he and Qu Yinsong were officially married. As for Qu's seduction by Li, although he had heard about it earlier, he was half-doubtful. It was not until Qu did not return home all night and he dragged out Li's letter to question Qu that Qu admitted it. They had secret meetings in the Nanjing Hotel, the New Asia Hotel, and other places, and the tea servers of the hotels could testify. Subsequently, according to Qu Yinsong, the first time she had intercourse with Li was on December 29th at the Nanjing Hotel. She returned home that night. The second time, she stayed in New Asia for one day. Li suggested moving to Dadong. In total, she was raped six times, all arranged by Li. When questioned, Li Jichuan denied everything, saying that Qu was actually Feng's concubine. They signed a cohabitation agreement at lawyer Yan Dajue's office on December 22nd, 22nd year. On the same day, Feng and his ex-wife Guan Huifang also signed a divorce agreement at lawyer Yan's office. The letter from the plaintiff to Qu was not written by me and can be identified. Because Qu felt that she was not treated well after living with Feng, she once came to discuss divorcing Feng. I inquired and learned that they were not husband and wife, so there was no need for a divorce. Later, because they were neighbors, I did not want to handle the matter and refused the request. Unexpectedly, Ma then held a grudge and fabricated accusations. After mutual arguments between the lawyers of the two parties, Judge Pan ruled that the verdict would be announced at 3 p.m. on the 25th of this month.</p>

<h3>Lushan Maru Busts Traffickers</h3>
<p>Rescues Five Children</p>
<p>The day before yesterday evening, Chen Shaoting, an investigator from the China Women and Children Relief Association, together with Huang Songsheng and Zhou Zenghua, detectives from the Customs Water Police Station, went to the Lushan Maru, a China-South shipping vessel at the Nissin Company Pier in Laobaidu, Pudong, to investigate. Inside the ship's cabin, they caught sight of a middle-aged woman leading five boys of various sizes with suspicious behavior. They immediately interrogated her. The woman claimed to be Zhao Zhang, 37 years old, from Henan. Three of the children were her own sons, and she did not know the other two. The detectives then interrogated each child separately. Zhang Ayun, 15 years old, from Siyang, had a deceased father and a mother who farmed in the countryside. Liao Genquan, 13 years old, from Jiangxi, had a father named Liao Tongsheng who ran a bamboo shop somewhere in Tilanqiao. Wang Daogen, 13 years old, from Jiangwan, had a father who was killed by stray bullets during the January 28th Shanghai War when he did not have time to escape. His mother had remarried and was missing. Gao Qiangji, 10 years old, from Anhui, had a father who farmed in the countryside and an older brother named Daxi Zi who worked in a yarn factory somewhere in Yangshupu. Wang Atang, 13 years old, from Ningbo, had deceased parents. When questioned, Zhao Zhang also claimed that she was entrusted by Li Maoqian, a Shandong man living in a grass shed on Mabai Road in West Shanghai, to take them on the ship. Li fled during the interrogation, and she didn't know anything else. The detectives then went to a bed in a certain room in Yinghuali on Mabai Road with the Putuo Road Police Station, arrested Li, brought him back to the case, and interrogated him. He directly admitted that he colluded with Zhao Zhang to abduct five children from various places, trained them skillfully, intending to take them to sell in Xiamen and Shantou, with each child selling for more than 100 yuan. The head of the detectives verified the confession and referred it to the local court for interrogation yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Zheng Pengmei Witnesses Wife's Adultery</h3>
<p>Angrily Gathers Crowd to Capture. Court Investigates and Sentences</p>
<p>Zheng Pengmei (also known as Zheng Hongqin), a 33-year-old man from Wenzhou living at No. 19, Lane 268, Metcalfe Road, worked as a waiter in the nearby Tomson Apartments. Seven years ago, he married a woman surnamed Huang from his hometown. Huang, who is now 25 years old, had a good relationship with Zheng after they got married. They had a son named Dahua, who is already four years old. However, Chen Youzhen, a 32-year-old man from Wenzhou who worked as a butler for a foreigner at No. 24 Baisai Zhong Road, was also from the same hometown as Zheng Pengmei and in the same industry, so they knew each other. At around 11 p.m. the night before, Zheng Pengmei returned home from outside and suddenly saw his wife Zheng Huang having intercourse with Chen Youzhen in the bedroom. He was filled with jealousy and gathered a crowd to capture both the adulterer and the adulteress. They took them to the Zhangjiazhai stove shop to negotiate. Zheng initially demanded 300 yuan, but finally settled on 80 yuan, wrote an IOU, paid 16 yuan in cash, and dispersed. Unexpectedly, Chen Youzhen was unwilling and immediately reported to the Xinzha Police Station. After investigation by detectives Wu Changkai and Wang Qishan, Zheng Pengmei, Zheng Huang, and Chen Youzhen were arrested and detained in the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan filed a lawsuit against Zheng Pengmei for extortion under Article 346, Section 1 of the Criminal Law, and against Zheng Huang and Chen Youzhen for adultery with a married person under Article 239 of the Criminal Law. The court declared that the hearing was closed to the public because the case concerned morals. As a result, Chen Youzhen was sentenced to three months in prison, Zheng Pengmei was sentenced to 30 days of detention for obstructing freedom, with a two-year suspended sentence. As for Zheng Huang, because she did not withdraw the complaint, the case was not accepted.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Reduction Plan</h3>
<p>Board of Directors Resolves to Change a Portion</p>
<p>After the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council passed the reduction plan proposed by the council's Staff Economic Committee, many opinions were received from council members, which have been sent to the committee for consideration. Now, the committee has adopted some opinions and proposed several revised recommendations. When the council's Board of Directors met on the 20th of this month, it passed each of the revised recommendations. The revised points are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Regarding retirement savings, the committee originally recommended that exchange allowances would not be given on the interest generated from retirement savings under the new rules. It is now approved, as requested by the council members, that exchange allowances will still be given on the interest generated from retirement savings under the new rules.</p>
<p>㊁ Some current "B" category staff members hired from Shanghai originally had the hope of being reclassified into "A" category in the future. After five years of service, they can enjoy the privilege of applying for long leave. According to the amendment, this type of staff member will be treated the same as staff members holding "A" category appointments and "B" category staff members hired from abroad and can also apply for long leave after five years of service. However, the new rules on exchange allowances and travel expenses apply to those who follow.</p>
<p>㊂ According to the new amendment, staff members who can apply for long leave between July 1, 1937, and December 31, will have their salaries during their long leave paid at the exchange rate of one Chinese national currency yuan equivalent to one shilling and six pence in British gold, limited to 700 yuan. Staff members who can apply for long leave in 1938 are limited to 600 yuan. Staff members who can apply for long leave in 1939 are limited to 500 yuan. The exchange rates are the same as above. The original new rules still apply to staff members who can apply for long leave after 1939, i.e., their salaries during their long leave will be paid at the exchange rate mentioned above, limited to 400 yuan.</p>
<p>㊃ According to the amendment, the salaries of the current members of the Russian Company of the Merchant Corps, except for officers, will not be reduced immediately, but there will be no salary increase within one year. The annual salary increase for acting corporals and soldiers will be changed from 3 yuan to 4 yuan. The salary scales for captains and adjutants are revised as follows: Minimum Annual Increase Maximum Salary Salary Captain 207 yuan 14 yuan 276 yuan Adjutant 230 yuan 9 yuan 184 yuan</p>
<p>㊄ According to the amendment, current employed health inspectors, if they have passed all the council's examinations and hold a certificate from the Royal Sanitary Institute of Great Britain, may apply for seven months of long leave and two months of "research leave" after five years of service. The council will provide funding to go to the United Kingdom. After that, for every five years of service, they may apply for seven months of long leave, but the new rules regarding travel expenses apply to those under the same time. Health inspectors employed in the future may apply for their first long leave after five years of service if they have accumulated enough short leave to apply for long leave in order to participate in the Royal Sanitary Institute of Great Britain's meat and food inspector examination. The council will provide funding to go to the United Kingdom. During the first long leave (including the "research leave" period), the council will pay 30 weeks of salary. If they participate in the aforementioned examination and fail, they must return three weeks of salary. There will be no salary increase and no further "research leave" may be applied for until they pass the examination. Subsequent long leave will be handled in accordance with the new rules.</p>

<h3>Xing Zhigang Requests the Prohibition of Misappropriating Special Funds for Cooperative Dredging</h3>
<p>Zhoupu Pond in Pudong is a major river for transportation between Shangnan and Liang counties. Yesterday, Xing Zhigang, the Fifth District Chief of Shanghai County, opposed the misappropriation of special funds for cooperative dredging and requested the Nan Hui County Chief to stop it. The document stated: "According to the New Pudong Daily of the previous issue, the Zhoupu City River Dredging Committee proposed how to raise funds for the project and resolved to request the county government to borrow 500 yuan from the Shanghai Cooperative Dredging Zhoupu Pond fund. This is very surprising. The special fund for the Zhoupu Pond river works in Shanghai County was donated by Shanghai County to Nan County during the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty to generate interest and use it for the downstream dredging of Zhoupu Pond. The principal and interest were retained, and Shanghai County no longer dispatched labor to ensure its long-term use. Shanghai and Nan Counties jointly informed the higher authorities and were approved and each filed their cases. They also jointly erected a stone tablet stating that the special fund should be protected and managed in accordance with the regulations to ensure long-term prosperity and benefit. This was recorded on the tablet for permanent compliance. Fifty years have passed since then, regardless of how the national system has changed, the special fund for cooperative dredging of the river works cannot be moved without actual use for downstream dredging. Moreover, it has been recorded in the new county annals of Shanghai and Nan Counties, and the monthly report of the Public Funds and Property Management Office in the New Nanhui Daily also has a separate item for the special fund for Shanghai Cooperative Dredging Zhoupu Pond to make it clear. Therefore, it cannot be borrowed under any circumstances. Moreover, Zhoupu is the leading town and commercial center of Nan County. Dredging the city river is ⑴ to facilitate transportation and develop business; ⑵ to discharge water smoothly and clean drinking water. All shops and residents in Zhoupu City will surely enthusiastically contribute upon hearing the news of the dredging, and there is no need to misappropriate the special fund for downstream dredging of Shanghai County to avoid causing misunderstandings among the people of Nan County and hindering the established case. Therefore, I specifically present the situation to you, requesting your review and approval, and promptly order the Zhoupu City River Dredging Committee to strictly prohibit the misappropriation to protect the special fund and maintain the established case. I am deeply grateful."</p>

<h3>The Health Bureau Attaches Importance to Health Care</h3>
<p>Formulating Management Rules</p>
<p>Health care organizations are originally a type of social health undertaking. Therefore, countries with developed medical and health undertakings are actively promoting them to seek the welfare of the society and the people. Recently, this type of organization has been established one after another in this city. Although the purposes are the same, the content is different. The Health Bureau, in view of the complex medical community in this city, cannot avoid cunning people who use the good name of health care to achieve the practical effect of gaining profit. It has specially formulated a set of provisional rules for the management of health care associations and sent them to the Planning and Accounting Bureau to participate in their opinions so that they can be presented to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation to implement management and prohibition.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Ten Thousand Kinds of Greeting Cards</h3>
<p>Yu Dani Petitions for Pensions for Wounded Soldiers in the Suiyuan War</p>
<p>Yu Dani, the director of studies at the Leisi Elementary School in this city, loves to paint and is fond of art. Over the years, he has collected more than 70,000 kinds of art greeting cards, which are brilliant and varied and cannot be valued. Now, because Dean Fei of the Guisui Public Hospital entrusted him to raise funds for the treatment of wounded soldiers, he has specially selected more than 10,000 cards and divided them into 16 categories: film, image, music, light, strange, flower, miscellaneous, tree, dynasty, hall, stove, candle, painting, boat, scenery, and vehicle. During the school's winter vacation, he will publicly exhibit them in the school's three-story building at No. 36, Tianzhu Church Street, outside the New Beidou. He will also selectively display his own books and recent works, as well as photos of wounded soldiers. Mr. Yu's painting skills follow those of the Qing Dynasty's Lang Shining and are the most successful of amateur Western painters. His works are not easily given to others, but now, in order to support Suiyuan and save the wounded, he is selling them at a low price. It is reported that the entrance fee is 20 cents per person, and all income will be donated to the treatment of wounded soldiers. Yesterday afternoon, there was a preview to entertain the news and art circles. Mr. Yu personally hosted and served tea and snacks.

<h3>Interesting Anecdotes of a Smoker in Prison</h3>
<p>Making the "Immortal in the Belly" Laugh and Worrying the Woman in the Village</p>
<p>Chen Jinsheng, the old purser of the Tianlu Tea and Food Shop in this city (from Shuangdunmiao Village, Wutang Township, Jiading County), one night at midnight, suddenly pretended to go out to urinate, wearing only a single layer of clothing, and never returned. The people in the shop immediately searched for him in all directions for several days without any news. They notified his family, and his wife also inquired in many ways after hearing the news, but could not find him. It happened that the Mi family in Zhangjia Village, Zumao Mound, in that area, specialized in calling back the dead and looking at incense heads, and they were generally called "Immortal in the Belly." Ordinary ignorant men and women believed in them, so Chen's wife also invited them to her home to inquire about the survival of her husband, providing incense and candles and burning paper ingots. The "Immortal in the Belly" pretended to yawn several times, and his stomach made noises. After a while, he said, "Your husband has left the world and is now in the Senluo Hall." Chen's wife wept and begged to see him. Then, the "Immortal in the Belly" falsely claimed that "Your husband has arrived," and spoke nonsense. At this time, Chen's wife kowtowed like pounding garlic, and the "Immortal in the Belly" said, "The time limit has arrived," and then took his leave. Chen's wife knew that her husband was dead and immediately set up a memorial tablet to summon his soul, wearing mourning clothes. She hired monks and nuns to transcend his soul, but when the drums and cymbals were sounding, the postman delivered a letter from her husband, saying that one night he went out to smoke opium and was arrested by the police. He is now detained in the Caohejing Prison and described the various experiences of his arrest. His wife then knew that he was still alive and quickly dismantled the spiritual tablet and tidied up the ritual ground, burning a lot of firecrackers. For a while, it was spread far and wide as an interesting anecdote.</p>
<h3>Sun Changlin Sentenced for Injuring a Person Resulting in Death</h3>
<p>Tang Jikun, a Chaozhou native who sold red pills and lived at No. 29 Baoan Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, also known as Xiaoqiao, was stopped by thugs at the entrance of Baoxing Lane and extorted for bribes. He was dragged into Baoxing Lane, lifted up, and slammed to the ground several times (commonly known as "arranging three and one with the soil"), causing serious injuries that led to his death after treatment. The French police arrested the two perpetrators, Xiaomapi and Xue Agen, and handed them over to the Second Special Court, which sentenced them to imprisonment. Xue appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which sent it back to the High Court for retrial. On December 4th of last year, the French police arrested another member of the gang, Sun Changlin (23 years old), a native of Pudong, and handed him over to the Second Special Court. The police lawyer prosecuted and interrogated him according to law. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The case has now been concluded by Judge Sun Peng. Yesterday, Judge Sun came to the First Criminal Court and sentenced Sun Changlin to five years of imprisonment for jointly injuring a person resulting in death. He will be transferred to the detention center during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Er Guniang Sues Her Lover for Theft</h3>
<p>Reimbursing Him with 10,000 to 20,000 Gold, Abandoned Due to Old Age and Loss of Beauty</p>
<p>Yu Jinbao, aka Er Guniang, a 34-year-old woman from Taizhou, lived at No. 4 Tong'an Lane, Changan Road, Zhabei. Her father and former husband were both deceased, leaving her with a lot of property. She owned several trucks that transported yellow sand and stones, bringing in a lot of money every day. Er Guniang was quite capable and would go to the Changle Tea House on Fourth Horse Road every afternoon to solicit business. Everyone in the construction and brick-and-mortar industries knew Er Guniang. Seven or eight years ago, she hired a bookkeeper, Lu Yongxiang, who was five or six years younger than Er Guniang. He was not particularly handsome, but he wore Western suits and leather shoes and liked to dress up, so Er Guniang considered him a "boy toy" and had an affair with him. Now, Er Guniang is suing Lu Yongxiang for theft in the Local Court. According to Er Guniang, she has reimbursed Lu Yongxiang with more than 20,000 yuan over the years. Now that she is old and has lost her beauty, she has been abandoned. On November 2nd of this year, Lu borrowed money and, taking advantage of her absence, led several people to break into the upstairs room, damaging the door and stealing 970 yuan in cash and more than 140 yuan in clothes, etc. She immediately questioned Lu, who admitted it, and the maid Qin Wangshi can testify. Lu Yongxiang lived at No. 15 Zhangjiazhai, Zhongshan Road, Jiaotong Road, and requested to be detained, etc. Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the court yesterday, but the defendant did not arrive, and the hearing was rescheduled to January 27th.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Marries a Rich Man and Disregards Her Poor Mother</h3>
<p>Even Expelling and Insulting Her Greatly - Fined 100 Yuan by the Court</p>
<p>Shen Manyun, a famous Shanghai tycoon, known as Shen the Millionaire, owns over a hundred new-style buildings in Xincheng Li, Xicang Road, behind the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau in the city, which is just a small part of his property. His eldest son, Shen Zurong, lives in the Doupai Mansion, No. 24 in that lane. Shen Zurong married Shen Hu, daughter of Old Woman Hu Xu from Taicang (given name Ruizhu, age 22). Old Woman Hu Xu, widowed, lost her eyesight due to excessive grief, making her 50 years old and causing her to wander destitute in Nanxiang. Her son, Hu Zhonglin, is a clerk at a money shop in Doushi Street and is also married. Old Woman Hu Xu, thinking that her children might help her survive and knowing that her son was at her daughter's house, went to her daughter's house in heavy rain, soaked to the bone, seeking to see her children and beg for a living. However, her daughter cursed her mother as a pig, saying her words were like farts, and cursing her mother to die sooner rather than later to avoid living in this world, and even drove her out. Filled with anger and indignation, the old woman hired lawyer Liu Xiang to file a complaint in the local court, accusing her daughter, son, and son-in-law of violence and disrespect to elders. She stated that her late husband had left a small fortune, but most of it was spent on raising their children, especially to provide her daughter with a dowry when she married into a wealthy family, spending the remaining five or six thousand yuan entirely on her trousseau. As a result, she was left penniless and disabled, unable to support herself. She accused her daughter of being snobbish and urged the court to punish her severely. The prosecutor suggested reconciliation, but Shen Hu refused to yield to her mother, so she was prosecuted. During the trial, Hu Zhonglin showed some filial piety and offered to support his mother, begging for forgiveness. However, Shen Hu remained stubborn despite Judge Lu Hongze's persuasion. Therefore, yesterday, the judge ruled that Shen Hu was guilty of insulting elders and imposed a light fine of 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Trafficking of Women into Prostitution Case Is a Large-Scale Organization</h3>
<p>Lu Jiale and Others Are the Main Culprits - Verdict to Be Announced on the 25th</p>
<p>Zhang Fengying, a 14-year-old girl from Wuxi, recently came to Shanghai from her hometown and stayed with her aunt Zhu Juzhen at No. 21 Mao Hai Road, intending to find work in a cotton mill. She suddenly disappeared on November 7th last year and was abducted to Qingdao, then resold to the Lebaoshan Wife Brothel at No. 12 Zhimiangou, Dalian, to become a prostitute. Because the girl was young and not fully developed, she was temporarily kept at the brothel. Subsequently, Chinese detectives Feng Qishan and Xia Shutang of the Hongkou Police Station arrested the suspects Liu Fengsheng, Zhang Changbao, Lu Jiale, the woman Liu Zhao, the woman Zhang Chen, and Yu Junxiang (also known as Xiao Yu), who turned himself in, at No. 304 Gongping Road and in Wusong Road, Qingdao, and Dalian. These ten men and women were separately escorted to the First Special District Court for interrogation. This newspaper has reported this several times. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhong Qing presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Lawyer Zhang Tianyin of the Public Works Department stated that Yu Junxiang was arrested outside the courtroom during the recess. The reason was that Zhang Fengying was lured out by Liu Zhao and then taken by her son Liu Fengsheng to Zhang Changbao's brokerage, where they colluded with Ling Defu and Yu Junqing. Ling and Yu then took the girl by boat to Qingdao and then to Dalian to be sold as a prostitute. After receiving the money, they promised to give him thirty yuan. He returned to Shanghai first, and after the case was cracked, he came to the court that day to inquire about the news, still hoping to get the thirty yuan, which led to his arrest. The defendants in this case are a large-scale organization. Lu Jiale, Wang Runzhi, Ling Defu, Yu Junxiang, and Zhang Changbao are the main culprits who specialize in trafficking women, and the rest are accomplices. He requested that they be severely punished. When questioned, the defendants gave evasive and contradictory testimonies, blaming each other. The court ordered them to be remanded in custody separately and scheduled the verdict for the 25th.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Commentary on the Guangjiu Railway Express Accident</h3>
<p>— Zinan</p>
<p>The cause of the Guangjiu Railway Express accident is still under "investigation in Guangzhou to clarify the truth." The "truth" awaits the report after the "investigation meeting." However, based on the current telegrams and imagination, we can generally believe that the fire was caused by "rosin-based toys." According to the quick telegram in this newspaper on the 17th, "the cause was two baskets of chemical toys placed in the third-class carriage toilet. The train's shaking caused a fire, which burned down to the lubricating oil of the wheels, and the rapid speed of the train and the wind quickly ignited three carriages." Although this account differs slightly from the Reuters telegram on the 18th, they can supplement each other. According to the Reuters telegram, "the fire was caused by a passenger accidentally touching a rosin-based toy with fire, which quickly spread to various luggage..." It is clear that there were many rosin-based toys, but whether the fire was caused by "shaking and catching fire" or "a passenger accidentally touching it with fire" still needs investigation. However, judging from common sense, the latter is more likely.</p>
<p>Regardless of how the fire started, let's look at the casualties. According to the authorities' announcement, "the tragedy resulted in a total of 77 deaths and 35 injuries." However, according to the Reuters telegram, "the number of victims has exceeded 105." Whether it is 105 or 77, it is truly speechless that such an unprecedented tragedy occurred on a railway that was always considered well-managed.</p>
<p>According to our imagination, the cause of this tragedy was due to negligence and carelessness. Whether it was "two baskets of chemical toys" or "sulfuric acid stored in the washroom suddenly exploded (Reuters telegram on the 17th mentioned this)," leaving dangerous items carelessly in public areas where passengers come and go is negligence of duty, even before the tragedy occurred. If the item was brought in privately, whether by a passenger or a train employee, the manager should have the responsibility to investigate its source!</p>
<p>What is even more unfortunate is that "the driver did not notice the fire until it had spread to the third carriage and then stopped the train." If the driver had not noticed it and continued driving at high speed, the tragedy would have been even more unimaginable. The reason the driver did not know for a while was that "there was no emergency alarm system in the carriage, so it was impossible to warn the driver." The reason there was no alarm system was that "it was feared that passengers would unknowingly pull the alarm rope, so this equipment was not installed."</p>
<p>Because of the fear that "passengers would unknowingly pull the alarm rope," "this equipment was not installed." This reason is as naive as "avoiding eating for fear of choking." Looking at the alarm equipment in other public places, there seems to be no "passengers unknowingly..." situation. Therefore, whether the lack of alarm equipment on the train is due to fear of "passenger ignorance" is worth pondering!</p>
<p>The lack of alarm equipment makes me think about why the fire did not occur in the first-class carriage but in the third-class carriage. I really can't bear to think about this issue, but I want to ask a question: Are there or can there be dangerous items such as "chemical toys" or "sulfuric acid" stored in the washrooms or toilets of the first and second-class carriages?</p>
<p>It is never too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. However, for this tragedy, in addition to hoping that measures will be taken to prevent such incidents from happening again and that the lives of third-class passengers will no longer be treated as child's play, we also hope that the cause of this disaster will be thoroughly investigated!</p>
<p>The railway authorities may have a reason for their negligence and tolerance, but for their own safety, passengers cannot ignore this tragedy.</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage to the Snake Temple</h3>
<p>— Nanou</p>
<p>Most people who have been to Penang have visited the Kek Lok Si Temple. Kek Lok Si Temple is an ancient Chinese-style place, not very unusual, and I didn't find it very interesting when I went there. This time I went to Penang because the ship back to China passed through here and only stayed for half a day. My old friend Lao Rong entertained me: "Would you like to go somewhere for fun?" He asked me this after we had eaten at a curry restaurant opened by a Jilining person. Penang was not unfamiliar to me, I had come here specifically to play before. I said I didn't want to go to Kek Lok Si Temple and these other places. If there really was nowhere to go, then it would be good to just stroll around the streets here. I really like the quiet and peaceful atmosphere of the streets of Penang. When I was walking towards the coast with a yearning for a foreign land, weren't the star-like eyes of the Nyonyas ① half-hidden in the window seams on the second floor so charming? Although that trip to Penang was two years ago, it left me with an unforgettable impression.</p>
<p>Lao Rong thought for a moment and suddenly slapped the table and shouted, "I've got it! I've got it! You haven't been to the Snake Temple yet!"</p>
<p>"Snake Temple?" I felt it was too bizarre, and I had never heard of the Snake Temple before. So he told me that the Snake Temple could definitely give me a little stimulation, and the customs there were indeed not very ordinary. We calculated the time and felt that it was still very sufficient, so we hired a car and went to the Snake Temple.</p>
<p>In the speeding car, Lao Rong told me about the situation of the Snake Temple. Since it is called the Snake Temple, there must be snakes inside. Lao Rong said that some of the natives of Penang worship snakes, treat them as gods, not only dare not harm them, but also pray to them and kowtow to them. I know about the primitiveness of the minds of the natives of Southeast Asia. In the history of human culture, the superstition of backward nations is still an incomprehensible fact. At this time, I was indeed a little excited, and with a curious heart, I hoped that the car would drive to the gate of the Snake Temple as soon as possible.</p>
<p>What kind of place is the Snake Temple? When I arrived there, it was so different from what I had imagined! The temple building was small and dilapidated. Compared with the magnificent Kek Lok Si Temple, it was really too far apart. I followed behind Lao Rong step by step and approached the temple gate. From inside, there came a strange fishy smell. On the temple gate, the shadows of snakes appeared. These were some small green snakes. I was stunned and almost cried out. Lao Rong laughed and said, "Don't be afraid, snakes don't bite when they become gods!" However, I have always been afraid of snakes. Now, on the one hand, I don't want to go in anymore, and on the other hand, I am driven by curiosity and hope to go in and see what kind of situation it is. I finally went in with Lao Rong. Looking around, the light was very gloomy. The shadows of snakes filled the beams, shrines, drum racks, candle holders... These snakes were entangled there, motionless, smoked by the strong smell of incense. Occasionally, when one moved, my nerves would tremble. I could never be as calm as Lao Rong. In front of the altar, a native was devoutly kowtowing, muttering something I couldn't understand. Later, Lao Rong asked him, and the answer he got was that his son was sick and had seen two doctors.</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>He had not improved after seeing them, so he came here to ask for the protection of the gods. This native had a wrinkled face that had been overwhelmed by life. Although I sympathized with him in my heart, I doubted whether his prayers would be effective...</p>
<p>There is nothing to see in the Snake Temple. And the time for me to board the ship was approaching, so Lao Rong and I left the Snake Temple and still took the original car back.</p>
<p>This time I passed through Penang, I only saw Lao Rong and went to the Snake Temple together. If I had known that the Snake Temple was such a place, I would rather have taken a walk on that quiet street, bathing in the sunshine.</p>
<h3>In Front of the Hotel</h3>
<p>— Menghua</p>
<p>Autumn days are short. Small shops in the town close their doors for the night right after dinner. The muddy dirt road is completely dark. On the main road into town, only the Yucheng Hotel is still open, its grayish-yellow light cutting through the darkness of the road.</p>
<p>At the first square table inside the hotel entrance, three people are talking in hushed voices. Anxious expressions make their faces even gloomier.</p>
<p>"It's time already. Could Leper have run into trouble?"</p>
<p>What follows is total silence. The evenings in Nomura are desolate, with stray dogs barking yelping.</p>
<p>A gust of west wind blows through the street, raindrops falling on the puddles in the street, making a low, lonely sound, like the chattering of small fish.</p>
<p>Like a ghost, a shadowy figure appears. The newcomer is wearing a palm-fiber raincoat, covered in yellow mud, and he is Leper. He approaches the counter, rests his chin on his hand, takes off his dripping bamboo hat, revealing a head of messy hair and a pale, convulsing face, drops of water dripping from the edge of his hat...</p>
<p>The three seated guests, sensing an ominous premonition, fall silent, their eyes timidly fixed on him.</p>
<p>"They chopped him!" Leper cries out in a voice like tearing silk.</p>
<p>The shopkeeper sitting behind the counter immediately removes his hand from the abacus, stares and asks:</p>
<p>"What? Jin Sheng was chopped! Speak, Leper."</p>
<p>Leper shuffles over and sits on a bench, scratching his sparse hair violently with both hands, small white flakes falling down like snow. Suddenly, he raises his head, rolls his eyes: "Alas, they chopped him off this morning!..." He says, bowing his head, his feet stamping the ground incessantly.</p>
<p>They are all too familiar with this experience. What is unfolding before them is a scene that chills the bone. Hanging on a wooden pole next to the station is a small wooden cage, inside which is stuffed a swollen head with bared teeth and eyes like a dead fish, and drops of bloody water dripping from the butchered neck.</p>
<p>Then the entire hotel becomes as silent as death. People are lost in cruel memories. Before the shopkeeper's eyes, a familiar customer appears. He drops twelve copper coins on the counter and says:</p>
<p>"Shopkeeper Liu, give me a string of four-wen liquor!"</p>
<p>He never kept an account, and was the most law-abiding farmer in town, but now his head has been chopped off. In front of his eyes, the shopkeeper seems to see a headless corpse exposed to the wind and rain, the body swollen by the rain, with crows pecking at it. The shopkeeper's whole body goes into a spasm, and he says to himself in a low voice:</p>
<p>"What kind of world is this; someone like Jin Sheng also gets chopped, it's really..."</p>
<p>Echoing the barking of stray dogs and the sound of dripping rain, a wail is heard in the distance.</p>
<p>The four drinkers suddenly raise their heads and listen attentively.</p>
<p>"It's Jin Sheng's mother! Listen!" says the person sitting next to Leper.</p>
<p>The crying gradually gets closer. Disordered footsteps, the sound of feet stepping in puddles, suddenly ring out: "My Jin Sheng! You return my Jin Sheng! What crime did he commit? What crime did he commit? May you be struck by lightning! May Heaven pursue you! ... Ah... ah... Help! They snatched my Jin Sheng... Help... help... me..."</p>
<p>"She still doesn't know Jin Sheng has been chopped! Poor thing, really too..." says the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>A woman wearing a black short jacket is running out of town, waving her hands. Her duck-like, hoarse voice keeps echoing in the congealed air.</p>
<p>Like a homeless ghost, she floats past the entrance of the Yuxing Hotel, her hair falling over her chest.</p>
<p>It's raining, dogs are barking………</p>
<h3>The Magic of Photovoltaic Cells (Electric Eyes) (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>A young woman hurried into a public building. She walked up to a drinking fountain, looking for a switch or a button, wanting to drink some water to quench her thirst. After searching for a while, she couldn't find one. She lowered her head casually, and the water immediately spurted out, as if waiting for her. She secretly marveled. A nearby elevator attendant smiled at her and also lowered his head towards the fountain, and the water also came out for him. So he explained to the young woman: "This is because your head broke the light. Anyone who comes here to drink water, as long as they do this, the water will spurt out. They call this thing a 'photovoltaic cell' - Photoelectric cell."</p>
<p>That tightly pressed little photovoltaic cell, only a few inches tall, can automatically distinguish colors; open the doors of garages; prevent theft; extinguish fires; it seems to be a very magical thing. The "Aladdin's Lamp" used in the new era industry also adopts this method.</p>
<p>Astronomers use it to measure and compare the light transmitted from the stars to the Earth. Factory owners use it to report fires and prevent thieves. Detectives use it to curb the activities of robbers. Aviators use it to measure the height of fog on tethered balloons to ensure flight safety. Transportation experts use it to set up signals in the suburbs.</p>
<p>This "electric eye" has indeed almost endowed machines with human intelligence. Consider how it prevents prisoners from escaping from prison: If a prisoner quietly climbs over the wall, a gun hidden in the dark will automatically fire at him, and the alarm bell on the wall will also sound. This is because at one end parallel to the prison wall, there is a small beam of light that constantly shines on a photovoltaic cell installed at the other end. When the prisoner enters within the range of the photovoltaic cell's line of sight, he blocks the light, so the current stops. The resulting impulse will activate a mechanical and electrical device, which can also emit a large light or make machine guns fire continuously.</p>
<p>Light shining on certain metals or metal oxides will knock electrons loose, and those electrons will flow through a tightly closed current channel. This is the principle of the photovoltaic cell, which is only about the size of a dried nut.</p>
<p>The history of the photovoltaic cell is closely related to the study of the power of light and its effects. It is quite amazing that 2,000 years ago, it was discovered that only half of the light shining on an object is reflected, and the other half is absorbed by the object.</p>
<p>The basic principle of the new era photovoltaic cell was invented in 1887 by the German physicist Hertz. He noticed that a spark gap was affected by the light emitted from another gap while experimenting with spark emission.</p>
<p>In 1889, Elster and Geitel devoted themselves to applying this theory to practical use. After 30 years of research, they combined their work with that of Armstrong, Geeshal, and others, and succeeded in creating the incredible devices we have today.</p>

<h3>Zhao Huishen From "Thunderstorm" to "Street Angel"</h3>
<p>In the past few days, the China Traveling Theater Troupe is once again preparing to stage Mr. Cao Yu's masterpiece "Thunderstorm." In the past, it has also rehearsed this script, and the performance results have won the supreme praise from people in Shanghai and audiences who love drama from all over. This is certainly not accidental. The script is profoundly written, the acting skills of the China Traveling Theater Troupe are superb, and the hard work has contributed to it. We have only infinite respect for this group of artists who are striving for the development of Chinese theater!</p>
<p>I think that audiences who have seen "Thunderstorm" on stage will definitely be familiar with the name Zhao Huishen: She is the pillar of the China Traveling Theater Troupe and a female writer with considerable cultivation. In "Thunderstorm," she played a stepmother—Fanyi—her deep expression and insidious personality vividly portrayed a typical stepmother, leaving an indelible impression in the audience's minds. Established a noble and glorious evaluation on the stage.</p>
<p>Now, Ms. Zhao Huishen, after repeated consultations with the Star Film Company, has taken on a major role in Yuan Muzhi's new work "Street Angel." In the play, she is a prostitute who has experienced the vicissitudes of life and hardships. In the deep night, in the cold wind, she stands on the side of the road every night, with tearful smiles and hopeful hearts, soliciting passers-by, in order to win the favor of the procuress and solve the minimum of hunger and cold.</p>
<p>How painful is the heart of such a woman living an inhuman life under the heavy pressure of society! Isn't this her own wish? The cannibalistic system of real society forces her to succumb to this non-professional occupation.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, with Ms. Zhao's past success, it is very suitable to play this role struggling to survive in the sea of people. Her calm and composed expression will make "Street Angel" have better results.</p>
<h3>"Tarzan Escapes"</h3>
<p>Simultaneously Released in Nanjing and Greater Shanghai</p>
<p>Tarzan has been away from the audience for a long time, and today he meets with the people of Shanghai simultaneously in the Grand Shanghai and Nanjing theaters. There are endless strange monsters in the film, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer has put a lot of effort into the production. Photographers and actors have gone through hardships, went deep into the wilderness, and their lives were almost in danger several times. In the film, the veteran Tarzan, John Weissmuller, fights fiercely with ferocious lions, fights fiercely with giant crocodiles, and competes with strange bats. The situation is tense and extremely thrilling. The scenes such as flirting on the shore and bathing in the water are more thoroughly depicted than in the previous "Tarzan and His Mate". In addition to the old partner, the superstar Maureen O'Sullivan, there are also superstars such as Penny Tayham and William Henry.</p>
<h3>"A Garden of Spring Hues"</h3>
<p>"A Garden of Spring Hues" is another masterpiece of Yihua Film Company. It has been in production for several months, and the production is going very smoothly. The technology is very excellent. It is destined to be a pleasure for those who love Yihua productions. The whole play is divided into five groups, which are directed by five directors respectively. The main actors and directors of the film are introduced as follows:</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun, Ma Loufen starring, directed by Wang Cilong; Lu Ming, Wang Naidong starring, directed by Chen Kangran; Xu QinFang, Liang Dusheng starring, directed by Fang Peilin; Zhu Qiuhen, Wang Yin starring, directed by Xu Suling; Zhou Xuan, Guan Hongda starring, directed by Yue Feng; and other male and female actors work together to create this "A Garden of Spring Hues".</p>
<h3>Star Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Designed and built by "Star"</p>
<p>The Star Ballroom, which has been rumored for a long time to be reorganized, was officially opened at 4:00 PM yesterday by Miss Zheng Qian'er, a famous lady from Shanghai, with the band playing the Chinese national anthem. It is said that since Mr. Hu Maer took over the reorganization, he has spared no effort to greatly improve all the equipment of the Star. The ballroom was transformed by Mr. Wu Yaqing, an architect of the Star Film Company, together with the Star Design Department, into the latest era-type two-wheel rotation style. The walls are dyed in light water colors, like a "green" palace. The dancers were hired by the Star owners from major dance halls, and the band hired the famous band of Du Lun from the Great Shanghai Dance Hall to accompany the performance day and night. All the facilities can be called the crown of small dance halls in Shanghai.</p>
