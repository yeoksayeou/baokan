<h3>第七十次議會中表現出的日本矛盾（上）</h3>
<p>— 南雲</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>“危險！危臉！國民生活危險！”這是東京朝日新聞，在“今日之問題”欄中，代表日本大衆喊出來的呼聲</p>
<p>就在這一國民生活危險一的呼聲中，日本第七十次議會開幕了—時間是一九三七年的一月二十一日。</p>
<p>政府與政黨間，蘊釀了許久的政戰，現在是進入决定勝負的時期了。因為兩邊的態度都很强硬，所以議會第一天的空氣，就非常險惡。由於空氣的險惡。於是就由政府請求天皇，頒布詔書，從一月二十一日起，議會開會，暫停兩日。</p>
<p>在這議會開會暫停的兩日中，日本政局的動向，不外以下三點：</p>
<p>㊀政府總辭職。㊁解散議會。㊂政黨向政府屈伏。</p>
<p>依據目前政友現議會中的第二黨，佔議席一百七十二）和民政（現議會中的第一黨，佔議席二百零五）兩黨的態度，要想政黨對現政府屈伏，（對將來的政府屈伏，是有可能的）事實上簡直不可能。若說解散議會呢？軍部固然有這樣的决心，但在右傾的新政黨尚未結成，議會制度又不能卽時廢除的現在，解散後也是很困難•所以，從目前的趨勢看來，似乎是內閣總辭職，還較有可能性。</p>
<p>不過，內閣總辭職也好，解散議會也好，無論如何，政黨的勝利是很渺茫的。由日本現在的政情看來，後繼內閣，必將是更接近軍部的，更具有法西斯傾向的强力內閣。不這樣，就决不能出而组閣，这是很明顯的事情。</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>“二•二六”事件後，日本政治上的顯著特徵是：政黨和政府對立。政黨以一憲政常軌”為目標，政府後面却有着急進的軍部。在此次議會中，表面上看來，是政黨和政府的作戰，實質上，卽是政黨和軍部的鬥爭。不過這鬥爭的力量，是很有限度的。所以，在議會的第天，寺內陸相和政友會的議員濱田國松氏，就作了很激烈的舌戰。陸相說濱田國雄侮辱了軍部，濱田國雄就請陸相舉出事實。在濱田國雄答辯的時候，政友會的議席中，更屢次拍手高呼鼓勵作戰。因此，弄得陸相氣憤填鷹，在當日午後六時半的緊急閣議上，就提出了解散議會的主張。</p>
<p>他如有田外相演說時，議會之騷然狀態，以及馬塲藏田演說時，竟有政友會議員高呼“無恥”等事，這都是在日本議會史上，值得特記的。</p>
<p>本來，自一五•一五“事件）一九三一年五月，東京發生暴擊事件。發動者多為軍人。被襲擊機關，有首相官邸，日本銀行，政友會本部……等。犬養首相—政友會領袖—卽在當時被殺•自此以後，軍部內之法西勢力，自漸高漲。政黨內閣中斷，產生所謂的中間內閣（發生以來，日本政黨卽已走進沒落期。議會政治，是資本主義社會的產物。在資本主義的上昇期，無論何國，都是政黨的全盛時代。到資本主義走進沒落期的時候，政黨就不能不走進下向期或修正期了。現階段的日本政黨，就是走着下向期的路。若果想由下向變為上向，那必要有一種大的力量。可是現在的日本政黨呢，就缺乏這種力量。</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>因為政黨之走向沒落，所以在此次議會中，就表示出兩大政黨聯合共爭本身利益的特殊現象。在“齋藤內閣”及“岡田內閣”時，政友民政兩大政黨的立塲，都是不同的。這次呢？雖然在他們的提案中，也還有部份的强弱的別。但在爭取立憲政治這一點上，總算是對着同一的目標出发的。這在日本歷史上，也是稀有的事情</p>
<p>然而，兩大政黨，都是代表日本資本家和地主的利益的。資本家與資本家之間，有投資部門的不同，資本家與地主之間，又有利害的不同。因此，在政黨中也就含得有不少的矛盾。</p>
<p>在修正稅制案的提案中政友會和民政黨的態度就顯然不同。政友會主張削除交易稅，修改財產稅•民政黨却主張修改交易稅，削除財產稅。這就够說明兩黨的矛盾了。原來，政友會是比較代表現階段日本之商業資本家和地主們（政友會的議員多來自各地方）的利益的，民政黨却比較的是代表現階段日本资本主義社會下的產業資本家（民政黨的議員，多來自各大都市。）龐大的預算案，是國民生活的威脅。國民的呼聲，通過政黨，政黨藉着這呼聲，去和政府奮鬥，原是很合理的•然而，從這一次政民兩黨反對稅制的態度，就可以看出他們並不能代表日本大衆的利益了。她們主要的目的，只是想減輕一部份資本家和地主們的負担，而把這負擔轉移到作為“消費者”的大衆的身上。</p>
<p>又因為政友會還代表着地主的利益，在目前，地主也正感受到一部份資本家的壓迫，所以，政友會中一部份議員的言侖，也就比民政黨更來得强硬激烈了。但是，正因比，政友會中的接近軍需工業家的議員，也就更加活躍的進行組織新黨運動了。</p>
<p>除了政民兩大政黨外，在議曾中，還有社大黨（十八席），國民同盟（十二席），昭和會（二十五席）及東京會（九席）等。社大黨的言論，算是比較能代表大衆的，但也只是在口頭上代表一下而已，實際的鬥爭行動，社大黨從來就很少“至於國民同盟和東方會呢？法西的色彩已很濃厚，他們也是反對政附的、不過他們反對的理由，是嫌政府的能力不够。</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>從十二月以來，政黨內部發出的呼聲，以及最近一週間，政黨　度的强硬，强硬到連“長於外交”的廣田，都不願意在議會開會前，去訪問兩黨總裁了（日本舊例，在議會開會前，首相須訪問兩大黨的縂裁，諮詢政見。此次却於十九日閣議上，正式通過，停止訪問。）這雖然也可以說是政府對政黨的反攻，但政黨的這種强硬態度，却也不能不說是近年來日本政黨僅有的好現象。然而，由這强硬，也就看出日本政黨內在的弱點。自閣議通過預算案後，十二月份，東京以下十三都市的物價，較之九三一年（滿洲事變年當時，已騰貴了約百分之一十，這對於一般下層民衆，當是如何的嚴重。民衆的悲痛，撑着政黨的腰，政黨的氣勢自然很强硬。這是政黨的强點。但是，因為現在的日本政黨，並不是眞能代表大衆的，所以，在許多地方，政黨也就不能不對政府讓步，不能不和政府妥協。在目前的日本，國防費的充實與國民生活之改善，事實上已是不能兩全。代表資本家和地主的政黨們，為了本身的利益，當然也就只好偏重國防犧牲大衆了。</p>

<h3>民族與民主</h3>
<p>— 陶希聖</p>
<p>幾年來，我不談實際政治。幾年來的國家民族的危急，又使我不斷的對於國家民族有切迫的期待。這個期待，是從遠大的方面着想，是從實際政治的大趨勢靜觀。這期待不是用實際政治裏日常工作的眼光，也不是以希望當做事實。</p>
<p>在國際方面，中國的前途是與英美法蘇的國際和平路綫一致的。在强隣虎視鷹擊之下，中國沒有方法不反對侵略，期待和平。這和平，不用說是要以兵甲的保衛與國際的結合來取得。英美法蘇等國一年多以來，正為了世界和平努力，並為了世界和平而聯絡愛好和平或抗禦侵略者。中國的前途與他們一致是無疑的了。一年多以來，中英及中美的關係是明顯有很大的進步。只有中蘇的具體的政治經濟關係還有待於促成。但以國際大勢而論，兩國的接近是不成問題的。</p>
<p>由於國際反侵略路綫的一致，中國的外交已經在世界化了。假如有一國想加兵於中國，就有引起世界大戰的充實的可能。想加兵於中國的强國自有很大的顧忌。</p>
<p>中國對外的民簇的壁壘是一天一天的堅固的。並且這堅固的民族壁壘可以使中國外交上取得若干的勝算。我以為今年的外交可以强化，我期待中國外交的强化。</p>
<p>反觀國內的政治，雖有不少的嚴重的內爭時時發生，也有不少的人要利用外交的嚴重局面及民族的運動來引起內爭，但這些波瀾只有使那些實際政治裏日常工作者一時興高彩烈，一時灰心喪氣。如從政治的大趨勢看來，政治的前途是民主的統一。</p>
<p>統一才可以加强民族的壁壘。分裂可以破壞民族的長城。這是再顯明也沒有的事情。在外患足以覆滅全民族的時機，革命或倒政府的運動是絕對不為國民容許的。一切國民的政治經濟軍事力量，都應當集中於政府之下，才可以抗禦外侮。</p>
<p>政府為集中民力，必須取民主的方法與制度。幾年來的政制逐漸傾向於民主，是不可抹殺的。如國民黨內各派的團結共進，如黨外人才的入閣，如國民大會的準備召集，都是民主的朕兆。如欲集中民力，則政府順應這已有的傾向而更進一步，是可能的，也是應當的。</p>
<p>民主自有一定的限度。政府不會也不能授予在野黨派以推翻政府的暴行的自由。在野黨派如果主張他們的推翻政府的暴行的自由，則政府的力量勢必多用在安定內亂的方面。如欲共同鞏固民族的壁壘，在野黨派必須誠意保證國內的和平。</p>
<p>但是，隨民族對外抗爭的强化，國內的民主限度必然是擴大的。民族對外抗爭的時機，任何在野黨派也沒有發揮他們爭奪政權的手段的可能。同時，政府對於民力的集中，也相需更亟。</p>
<p>中國的政治的民主傾向，因此也是一天一天擴大的了。</p>

<p>（四）德國認為鮑爾攝維克主義、乃係世界之禍害、吾人曾謀以各種方法、避免此種禍害、嗣後若再與蘇俄、訂結新約、則對於吾人、實毫無價值之可言、若謂國社黨之德國、可代鮑爾攝維克主義、盡保護之責、此直不可思議、至若接受鮑爾攝維克國家之援助、亦非吾人之所欲、（三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>希氏復摘述安定歐洲大局之八點政策如下、</p>

<p>（二）各種人民互相尊重其重大利益、</p>
<p>（三）國聯必須改組、俾成為進化觀念之機關、</p>

<h3>希特勒演說摘要</h3>
<p>德意志銀行及全國鐵路國有　衆議院通過延長獨裁權四年　下令禁德人領取諾貝爾獎金</p>
<p>希氏復謂、外间誤以德國有自願孤立之意、殊屬憾事、須知世界各國對於他國之事、决無表示在政治上不感興趣者、倘使世界之小如今日之歐洲、則上述情形、更當確切不移矣希氏績告衆院稱、德國與波•奧•意•匈•南斯拉夫•保加利亞•希臘•葡萄牙•及西班牙諸國、均極友好、觀於日德防共協定之締結、卽可明瞭德國並無自願陷於孤立之意云、</p>
<p>希氏又稱、“余今鄭重聲明、德法之間、决無可以想像爭執之點、且已向荷蘭及比利時銀國保證、吾人將承認彼等之永久中立矣、德國在經濟上、亦無放棄國際合作之意、過去數月中、多數政治家之演說、頗使世人發生一種全世界皆將對德作經濟援助、而德人反予以固執拒絕之印象、自一九三二年以來、德國之海外貿易、並未减少、而反有增加、惟余意以為、除一種新的貨物互換之某礎外、不信別有更耐久之經濟合作、世界之經濟、因各國生物方面之混亂、及其相互間之關係、致受影響、德國對此、殊無責任、須知一九三二年時世界經濟之恐慌、確甚於今日也、德國四年計畫之進行、實有不得已之苦衷、余决不能建設一未來國家於外國政治家之保證或國際援助之上、必煩有賴於生產之眞正事實也、”</p>
<p>希氏對於英國未早採取其目前對歐洲統一之態度、引為遺憾、繼謂今已不復有凡爾賽和約矣、希氏接言曰、“就艾登氏觀之、布爾希維克主義或為設其根據地於莫斯科之一事、但就吾人觀之、此種主義實為一種大患、曾圖使吾國荒廢如西班牙然、”</p>
<p>希氏謂渠曾三次提出限制軍備之其體建議、均遭拒絕、其中最重要者、為法德應將其陸軍减至三十萬人、英法應將其空軍减至平等之程度、德英應締結海軍協定、僅最後一舉、曾經接受、艾登氏深信各國僅應有其國防所必要之軍備、艾登氏曾與莫斯科磋商此良好主義之實現、試問其曾得蘇俄何種保證乎、今唯德國能决定其自己防務之需要、意國與日本均同具此見、假使全歐均能知此、則渠愉快將更甚也、德國殊歡迎因英意協定之結果、而减輕地中海之緊張、此舉至少可限制降臨西班牙之禍亂、德国除在西班牙培植经濟關係外、並無其他關係、此種經濟關係、艾登氏曾稱為重要而有利者、近有一種傾向、謂德國之表同情於西班牙國民軍、乃有殖民之計畫、要知德國對於未佔取德國殖民地之各國、並無殖民之要求、將世界分成孰應有孰不應有之部分、實不能解决殖民問題、國聯若以判定世界現有狀况、棄諸永久、為其工作、則不若接受控制潮流之為愈、德國之繼續存在、端賴其覺悟必須考慮關於列國關係之必要改革、而實施之、德國應不要求殖民地以供軍用、唯將專供給經濟之用、吾國人口稠密、殖民地要求終將提出也、</p>
<p>希氏繼述及內政、於略舉已往四年中之政續後、向衆問曰、“孰能以今日之德國與四年前之德國相比較乎”、又問世界曾否有如此貫澈之革命、卽使極多往日政治公務員未受侵擾、而後以恩俸給予其最大之仇敵、繼曰、“惟吾人之政策、於涉及其他各處、未嘗大用之、數月前有一甚有聲望之英人向吾人抗議將莫斯科最大罪犯之一羈押於集中營內、余不知其人對於西班牙數萬男女婦孺慘遭焚殺、曾否提出抗議、就西班牙亂事中遭害者達十萬人一點而論、則國社黨革命中若殺死四五十萬人、吾人亦有權出此也、引導本國使知為人最偉大最莊嚴之工作、乃在保全種族、此實為人類歷史上之第一次、此並非引導各國陷於糾紛而實為第一次引導各國達於共同之諒解也、此並阻止猶太人希圖戴純良中級社會之假面具、以分裂與統制其他民族、國社黨之革命、如此偉大、而其精神上之基本、直至今日、猶未為世界所了解、光榮與美麗之社會主義、及眞正之民治主義、從未有勝於國社主義者、國社主義使每個兒童皆有達於一國領袖地位之途徑、</p>
<p>四年之前、全國失業者達六百萬人、農民似有淪於絕境之象，今日爾等當承認已踐行拯救彼等之約言矣、</p>
<p>希氏次述及德國二千年歷史中所遭不可言喻之浩劫、而抨擊經濟談論家之自援行為、彼等見一張紙幣之貶值、卽開始談論經濟之崩潰、實屬無病呻吟、希氏承認渠非經濟家且從未為理想家、希氏接言曰拯救吾民、非為財政問題、而為職業問題、一方當指導現有之勞工、一方當開墾土地、與發展鑛利、如經濟生活之領袖不能為此諸事則國家不得不取步驟、使現有之人工得相當之僱用、國家除聽令一年一千二百萬工時棄諸無用外、力能實行一切、四年計畫、實為對吾人經濟生活作此種有秩序的指導之最莊嚴的表示、而使彼脫離製造軍械業之工人獲有永久之工作、在許多工業中尚缺乏有訓練之工人、此為德國偉大的經濟發展中至可注意之一事、</p>
<p>希特勒演說、歷二小時始畢、並下令禁止德人領取諾貝爾獎金、旋卽由衆院一致通通、將賦予希特勒之全權、展長四年、此案係由內長富列克博士所提出、由各議員以日頭通過、並選舉戈林將軍連任衆院議長、聞希特勒演辭、完全係自行起草、卽最信任者亦未參加意見、希特勒演說時、頗受喉痛之累、曾咳嗽數次、希特勒向衆院宣稱、彼對於若干必要之措置、常不徵求以前敵國之意見、甚至不通知之、而斷然實施、蓋彼以為如此反可使對方易於接收也、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>［柏林］德國人民熱烈慶祝國社黨秉政四週年紀念日、急切期待之緊張空氣瀰漫全國、至中午而氣象丕變、商店及機關均停止工作、準備聆聽希特勒總理於下議院七百四十一議員前向全國人民演說、</p>

<h3>鍜鍊如鐵般的體魄，纔能雪恥！</h3>
<p>— 嚴懋德</p>
<p>小朋友們、健康是生命的泉源，洛克曾說：一偉大的事業，寓於健全的體魄，“可見健康的重要，有了健全的體魄，然後纔有不屈的精神，有了不屈的精神，然後纔能負担重大的任務。</p>
<p>德國漢堡地方，每當冬天下雪的時候，一羣小孩單衣露臂，在冰天雪地裏鍜鍊身體，有人問他們為何不怕冷，他們說：“我們要鍜鍊如鐵的身體，才可以報法國的仇呢！”諸位小朋友，人家在幼時，就這樣準備起來，其民族愛國的精神，實使我們欽佩而慚愧。</p>
<p>小朋友！要知道，現代的戰爭，是慘苦艱難的民族戰爭，全賴身體堅强，能作艱苦的奮鬥，纔能出去作戰，而我們老大的中國，雖有數千年的文化，可是民族的體格，衰弱到極點，因此西人稱我們東亞病夫國。</p>
<p>小朋友們！你們都是未來的主人翁，負有很大的責任，要雪國家的恥辱，建設新的中國，非有堅强的體魄不可，蓋强國必須强種，强種必須從幼時做起，從今以後，要鍜鍊鐵般的體魄，纔能雪恥，小朋友！牢記着這話。</p>
<h3>四烈士</h3>
<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友們！四烈士是誰？他們是上海市商會童子軍團的四位勇士—羅雲祥·毛徵祥·鮑正武·應文達·當“一二八”戰爭的明天，他們最重要的救護工作，立刻就成立，並且各人宣了“為國效忠，救難拯危，一切犧牲，在所不顧”的誓言，在團長指揮之下，就全體出發，一隊隊高舉着紅十字會的旗幟，向閘北一帶戰區，做着救護的工作，在三十一日的那天早晨，他們四拉勇士，當然也派出去工作，但直到晚上，還沒有回來，那就在不明不白中被害了！而他們的屍骨，至今還不知道在什麼地方？後來為了要紀念這四位童子軍，於是我們只好造了一個四烈士衣冠墓。</p>
<p>今日何日？就是羅雲祥·毛徵祥·鮑正武·應文達四位中國忠勇的童子軍，為了祖國的綠故而殉難了！小朋友啊！我們不都是童子軍嗎？那末，看四烈士以後，有什麼表示？有什麼感想？試問你們可有！四烈士那般的勇敢麼？到了萬分危急的當兒，你們肯犧性一切而在戰塲上做救護的工作？小朋友呀！我們應該知道，我們是不怕死的（？），只要為了民族爭生存，為了國家求獨立，什麼都願意犧牲，同時，四烈士的死，是非常光榮的，因為他們是為了祖國的緣故啊！所以他們這種壯舉！是可以震動整個的中國，整個的世界，尤其是我們的童子軍，他們的英名，是萬世不朽的。但是四烈士是死了，我們將怎樣來安慰地下的他們呢？</p>
<h3>動物的防寒</h3>
<p>— 曹義璇</p>
<p>諸君到了天氣寒冷的時候，大家才預備防寒的衣服。可是動物類，已早早天然的預備好了。譬如動物的毛，一到春暖時候，就要脫落，另生稀疏的夏毛，若到了秋冬之交寒風侵骨的時候，那又另換柔軟綿密的冬毛，而且毛的顏色，冬夏不同的。一則可以防寒。二則可以保護外界的侵害。也有到了冬天，身體內多藏脂肪，以備冬天食物缺乏時，可以營養身體，或貯蓄脂肪在皮膚下面，可以防溫度不容外散的。例如㊀鹿的斑點，到了冬天，此會消滅，它在夏季，全身生有很美麗的斑點，至九月秋凉時候，漸漸變化，十月中，完全換為冬毛，所有白色的斑點，都會消滅，變為混身褐色。牝鹿在首的周圍，又生長毛，柔軟的角，也變為堅硬的角，所以有斑點時，兩角柔軟，斑點消滅時，角變硬質了。㊁野豬到了八月時侯，體呈灰色，漸生冬毛，變為褐色，同時從頭到背，又生長毛，㊂麒麟到了冬天，生夏毛的地方，重生冬毛一層，雖然毛色不變，可是此夏毛更加濃厚綿密。㊃野兎在夏季，為黃黑的花毛，一到秋冬，在腰腹部分，變為白色，漸漸的變到耳尖為止，其他全身，那都為白色，㊄北極產的狐貍，夏天為黃褐色，冬為純白色，因為北極地方天氣寒冷，冰雪滿地，牠為保護起見，也變為白色了。㊅北極的熊，到了寒冷時候，頸的周圍，生長毛，回繞頸項。㊆駱駝自初冬以後，全身的毛，漸次伸長，交到春暖，毛漸脫落，好像裸體樣子，以上為獸類的天然防寒的生理狀態。說到鳥類，也是如此。璧如鴨類中的鴛鴦，在雄的背上，生了豐滿的羽毛，直到夏天，這羽毛才會脫落。雌亦同樣的，不過嘴的顏毛，雌為黃色，雄為紅色，這是雌雄的分別。次為雷鳥，這鳥棲於高山，夏為黃色，冬為純白色的厚羽，惟雄烏的眼睛上方，留有與夏毛相同的赤毛，尾的外邊，為黑色。還有一種都鳥，夏天頭上的黑褐色斑點，一到冬天，完全變白，所以我們對於禽獸毛羽的變化，如不明白理由，往要發生懷疑。其實無論那一種禽獸，毛羽的變更，是依寒署而不同的。好比我們夏天穿綢單衫的時候，是一個樣子，到了冬季換皮裘和呢絨的長袍大衣時候。那又變一個樣子了。</p>
<h3>烏賊</h3>
<p>— 仲美</p>
<p>小敏的母親，從萊市中買了幾隻烏賊魚，她預備給小敏做一頓鮮美的萊餚，在中膳時候，小敏吃到烏賊魚後，他不知道吃的是什麼東西，因為他還是第一次嘗着這可口的菜餚，於是在席間問他的母親：“這是什麼東西，怪可口的”，</p>
<p>母親答道“道是鳥賊魚也稱為墨魚。</p>
<p>“那麼它們的形狀是怎樣？我從未看見過呢，母親可能講一個大略給我聽”？</p>
<p>“它們的身體很柔軟，有頭部和胴部兩種分別，頭部：在頭的兩旁邊有大眼睛”對，在頭的頂上生一隻口？口的裏面生着角質的齒舌，在口的四面，有肉足十隻，它在匍匐行動時用足部內側的很多吸盤，捕捉食物時候用其中二隻最長的，胴部在胴部外面，有像囊一樣的稱外套膜，它分泌成功的一片橢圓形狀的骨片稱海螵蛸，它的功用就是當我們被刀割得出血的時候能够極快的止血，當它們游泳时候，就须靠頭部的肉足和胴部兩側的內鰭”。</p>
<p>“如果它們遇到比它們大的動物襲擊時，用什麼去抵制呢”。</p>
<p>“它們如果被襲擊以後有兩種方法：㊀在它們腹側下面，有一隻墨囊，其中有很多的墨汁，遇敵襲擊時，就放出墨汁，於是海水變成混濁，襲擊的動物就看，不見它們的行動，它們就很快的逃走了，㊁它們的外套膜外面有色素的細胞，遇到敵人以後，能够立刻使身體外部變成別種顏色，乘機游到別的地方去躲避。”</p>
<p>“它們除去吃和海鹽蛸的功用以外，有什麼用處？”</p>
<p>把它們的肉乾製以後叫黽脯，而墨囊中的黑汁，也可以造成顏料，它們的甲，可以做藥用。</p>
<h3>今後的中國兒童</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>今後的中國兒童”，應亦朝着那一條路上走？這是在今天所要提出來討論的一個題。</p>
<p>我以為：“今後的中國兒童，”應該認定下面幾個目標，奮勇邁進，勇往直前，這樣，才是夫個新中國的兒童，才是一個生存於非常時期中的中國兒童。</p>
<p>㊀力求身體的健康：—歐美人時常譏笑我們說：“中國人是東病亞，中國的兒童，是東亞病孩！”這二句話，眞是會着充分污辱的意味。在此非常時间中，國難嚴重的情况之下，成人一固然應該積極的從事於體格的鍜鍊，而兒童們尤其應該力求身體的健康，須知有了康健的精神，而後可以做偉大的事業；有了健康的身體，而後可以從事於民族復興的工作。兒童是國家的根苗，民族的柱石，對於這一點，實在不可不注意呀！</p>
<p>㊁努力科學的研究：—誰都知道，現在是一個科學的世界，科學的時代，歐美各國的强盛，一切事業的發達，完全建築在“科學”的基礎之上。現在我們要求民族復興，國家强盛，洗滌國恥，對於科學方面，非得下一番研究的工夫不可。希望兒童們，不要視科學為畏途，以為研究科學，是一件乏味的事，要知道：一切的趣味，完全在科學中得來，只要用心研究，興趣自然會跟着來的。</p>
<p>㊁注意德性的培养：—今後的中國兒童，不特要有健康的身體，科學的頭腦，而且還要有良好的德性，在消極方面，應該要有整齊清潔的習慣：在積極方面，尤其要有勇敢奮鬥的精神，如此雙方並進，良好的德性，才能養成。</p>
<p>上面三個目標，我認定是“今後中國的兒童”應該走的途徑。希望親愛的小朋友們，火家從今天民國二十六年的元旦日起，努力實行呀！</p>
<p>物理小常識</p>
<h3>為什麼水是透明的？雪是不透明的？</h3>
<p>— 何子祥</p>
<p>小朋友！冬天了，寒暑表上的水銀柱降到零點以下了，我們身上穿着棉衣，絨衣，還覺得冷，不得不圍着火爐來取暖。</p>
<p>流動的河水，已经水凍了；污濁的世界，已蓋上一層潔凈明亮的白雪了。</p>
<p>小朋友，我們知道雨是水受了熱，化汽上升，在空中遇着冷，凝結成點點的水滴，集合若于個小水滴，就成一個較大的水滴，掉下地面來，就是雨。</p>
<p>雪：小朋友，你可知道他是怎樣變成的？</p>
<p>停留在空中的水滴，遇着較冷的氣候的襲擊，就凝成冰雹或水；水雹或水，再遇到更冷的氣候，就被剖成一片片的雪</p>
<p>小朋友：你歡喜玩水嗎？你愛踏雪嗎？水是透明的，雪是不透明的，這是什麼道理？</p>
<p>雪是水的碎片，上面已經說過，雪和水的表面比較，雪是大些，由此表面反射的光亮也較多；並且雪片和雪片的中間的空隙，存留着空氣，透入的光綫，一部份通過之後，又入空氣中作全反射，所以不會透明，而呈白色。</p>
<h3>傳導</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>天氣是一天比一天的冷了，屋子裏已經結了一層厚厚的冰，那屋外的冷度是不用說了。敏兒的家裏是顯得特別的寒冷，因為他家是靠近荒野，地廣人疏。</p>
<p>敏兒是一個很喜歡清潔的孩子，當他每天早上起身的時候，洗面漱口當然是少不得的，但他更有一個很好的習慣！必先自審查自己的頭髮和指甲。一天他的指甲是長得長了，便去拿了一把剪刀去修剪，當他一拿到了這把剪刀，覺得它今天是格外的寒冷，冰冷徹骨，并且他又記得很清楚，在去年的廈天的時候，覺得它很溫和，這倒使他疑惑起來了。於是他便去請教他的問題解决者—他的哥哥聰兒，請他來回答這問題。</p>
<p>“弟弟，這個問題問得很有理，你要知道剪刀是金屬，而金屬是一種良導體，什麼呌做良導體？良導體是有一種東西，在它一端燃燒，於是那燃燒的一端的熟便能傳到全體。在冬天，外面的空氣是比你身體的熱度一定是很低，如果你的手碰到了那金屬，那金屬便能很快的把你手的熱，傳到冷的空氣中，於是你的手便覺得冷了。你更要知道，凡是熱的空氣是很容易和冷空氣混和，因為熱空氣是比冷空氣輕。但在夏天，空氣的溫度是比身體的溫度高，金屬能很迅速的把空氣的熱轉傳到你的手中，於是你的手便覺得熱了。”</p>
<p>“哥哥，你怎麼知道金屬是熱的良導體？有沒有別的東西是熱的不良導體？”</p>
<p>“從前我也有這樣的疑問去問教我們的先生，於是他便實騐給我們看：他拿了一根四寸長的鐵棒，一端放在燈上燒了幾分鐘，那棒手拿的一端便漸慚的熱了，可表示出熱由一端傳到他一端，有這樣情形的，便是良導體，玻璃，空氣等便是不良導體，不過這良導體和不良導體是雙方此較出來的。”</p>
<h3>請小朋友在寒假期中繼續努力援綏工作</h3>
<p>— 惟際</p>
<p>小朋友們！一年一度的寒假已到臨，大家又得在家中過快樂的寒假生活了！</p>
<p>可是，際此國難方殷，匪偽進擾綏邊聲中，事實上凡是中國國民的一分子，都應該拿出力量來援綏；有錢的出錢，有力的出力；上下一心時時刻刻的該做援綏工作！我們小朋友當然都是國民一分子，那麼大家何不趁着休暇的假期來努力從事援綏的救国工作呢？</p>
<p>雖然，小朋友們在過去所做的援绥工作，確是十分热烈：有的節衣缩食，有的節省零用，有的募衣捐欵，甚至有很多貧苦小朋友减食省錢的；這許多種種不同方式的援綏，都給了國家不少幫助，當然是值得大家贊揚的！但是我們該知道：要是綏邊的紛擾一日不止，我們的援緩工作就不能一日停頓！况且過去因大家在校求學而限於時间，不能十分地努力；現在卽已屆寒假的休暇時期，那末我們的援綏工作是更有繼續努力而擴大的必要了！</p>
<p>小朋友呀！我謹以十二分的誠意，希望你們再接再厲的努力從事援綏！把工作擴大起來！要達到匪偽金部肅清而後止！現在卽有很長的假期給我們利用，正是大家努力授緩工作的極好機會，希望你們切莫一味貪懶而把它錯過了！</p>

<h3>使兒童歡樂的玩具出借處</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>使每個女童人人有一個洋囝囝，使每個男童人人有一件玩具，像向公共圖書館借書一般。這是兩年前洛杉磯地方協會使男女兒童歡樂的一種創舉。該會的領袖，因為幾年以來，市面不景氣，許多兒童，連衣食都不周全，何況玩具哩。但是玩具在兒童心目中，也和衣食一樣寶貴。因此便想了個救濟計劃，協同教育團體市民機關，和表同情的一般人士組織了一個玩具山借處，仿照公共圖書館用卡片借書的方法。凡登記的申請人，每個女童可借一個洋囝囝，以兩星期為限，期滿可以續借，但不像圖書館，期滿不還，或還時捐壞，須繳罰金，因為這種處罰的辦法，是不便施於兒童的。並且還有一個優待辦法，每個女童在數十個洋囝囝中揀定所心愛的一個，在她“撫養”滿兩星期後，必須送還出借處檢查一次，倘若證明她是一個“好母親”，許她再留養兩星期，期滿後，再送去檢查。倘若仍然，收拾的很整潔，便許她再“撫養”六星期，六星期滿後，檢查時，倘若證明她確是一個“好母親”便許她把那個洋囝囝永遠留着，作為己有，這個辦法可以鼓勵和養成兒童愛惜物類的習慣。</p>
<p>所需的徉囝囝，從邢裏得來呢？都是富有之家捐助的。電影明星希爾台女士獨由她的洋囝囝室選出了二百餘個，捐助出借處。凡女童永久留着的洋囝囝，便算是她的螟蛉子，須填寫一张證書，送給那捐助人•因為這個辦法很有趣，所以開捐洋囝囝的時候，大家都樂於捐助，頓時得到一千多個。</p>
<p>出借處若另租房子，那費用便大了。所以跟公共學校和圖書館等情商，借用他們的餘屋，設立分借處。每一分借處，須先繳費六十元與出借處總部，或每月繳費五元，因為每個洋囝囝出借以前，都須消毒，整理，這費是充工人薪金的。不足的經費，由地方協會担任。至於经理出借事務的職員，有的是盡義務的，有的是略送夫馬費的。現在已租了一間寬一百呎長一百二十呎的房子，作為總工塲，裏面存四十個工人，每兩星期把還來的洋囝囝塗色作整一次，他們是很忙碌。</p>
<p>這事創辦以後，成绩很佳，所以現在各處紛紛仿效，規模比初辦的已擴大了不少，經費也很充足，並且有全國青年辦事處和當地的市政局帮忙進行一切。</p>
<p>上面所說的，是女性兒童歡樂的辦法，平於男性兒童，洋囝囝是不適用的，所以又另外募集了許多男童的玩具，如小脚踏車跑冰鞋種種。也照祥囝囝出借的辦法，滿了六星期，查明絲毫無損，便歸借者所有。現在洛杉磯出借處登記情用的卡片共有三千份。去年一年，借出共四萬一千次。從二月到六月底止，五個月內，借者的年齡，多在四歲至十歲之間，按照定章，從兩歲起，到十七歲止•洛杉磯城面積為四百五十萬哩，現在共有分借處六所。</p>
<p>我們中四貧寒人家的兒童，大約也都希望本地有這樣一個出借處，記者很願關心兒童娛樂的熱心士女發起這舉。</p>
<h3>義（二）</h3>
<p>— 青</p>
<p>一個大浪方過去，跟着又來了一個大浪，把那帆船衝過去，倒和那小礁石接近了一些，船長倍格眼見得沒有什麼希望了。便發下命令，來，喚水手們離船，設法到那小礁石上去，誰知水手們都不肯服從，同聲喊着决不離开這艘破船，除非請船長先走一步，達到了安全的境界。船長很鎮定的重又下令，對他們說他自己的生命，是放在最後一着，而無關重要的：水手們見船長態度很堅决，只得服從他的命今，很有秩序的離開破船，好像平時船兒進了港口，大家安然上船一樣。然而他們都已冷得僵硬，有好多人都爬不上那塊礁石，早被海浪蓆捲而去，可憐那大副也就這樣的殉了難了。船長倍格見大家都已走了，他方始以最後一人離開了破船，他見這所在離那陸地並不很遠，不過潮水正在高漲，預料不多一會，他們所站着的礁石，就得沒在水中，可是這一帶海岸，並無人跡，並且霧氣又很濃厚，眼見他們一夥人都得被那高潮所吞沒，再也沒有得救的希望了。</p>
<p>那個男敢的船員仍然不聲不響緊緊地抓住了那根繩子，决意要搭救他的夥伴。當下他很懇切的禱告了一番，腰間挽着那繩子，一路掙扎着，和那怒潮搏鬥，终于達到了那邊的海岸，立時回過頭去，放聲通知他的夥伴們，說自己已很安全的登岸了。</p>
<p>如今那在那岸和礁石的中間便橫着一根繩子，它的長度恰好給兩箇人在兩方面抓住着。他們唯一的希望就是攀住了繩子，冒險的爬到岸上去。那高漲起來的潮水，早已撲到了那些蹲在礁石上的水手們的手上，但是没有一個人搶着先走的，仍由船長倍格一個個喚着他們的名字，挨次攀上繩子，而他們一面還是懇求船長先走一步，而船長仍很堅决的答道：“我决不離開這礁石一步，必須等大家很安全的上了岸。”</p>

<h3>潘公展氏演講“統一與和平”</h3>
<p>聽講者四五百人　闡述至二小時餘</p>
<p>國民社云、上海青年會、昨日下午三時在該會禮堂舉行統一救國運動特別演講、請市社會局潘局長蒞會演講、講題為“統一與和平”、潘氏將統一之意義、和平之希望統一與和平之聯繋、中外各國統一和平之史實、歷歷如繪、闡揚無遺、並糾正時人對於統一救國之錯誤、指示國人努力之方針、演講歷一小時半、聽講者四五百人、非常興奮、潘氏演詞、略謂統一與和平猶天秤之兩盤、兩者有當然之聯繋性、茲</p>
<p>先述和平　我國當前最迫切之需要和平、分二點說明如次、㊀人類本性與吾國民族性均愛和平、古語云天地之大德曰生、本性之性係心旁加生、人為萬物之靈、當然好生、和平才能生存、春風和煦、草木才得萌動，民族性方面，由吾國歷史觀之、向來主張“繼絕世、興廢國、厚往而薄來、”吾國古代之寬厚仁慈、以王道治天下、决不能與現代帝國主義者同日而語，㊁自辛亥革命迄今二十餘年過程中、更感覺和平之需要、自清室云亡、軍閥割據、人民日在水深火熱中過生活、誰不願速化干戈為玉帛、實現和平、才得安居樂業、努力建設、國家如無和平，决不能有何建設、故人民望和平、實如大旱望雲霓、就事實言之、民國二十五年中多次逢凶化吉、轉危為安、試問何克臻此、全民希望和平之偉大力量有以感化一切耳、如全民充寒康樂和平、則全國日趨欣榮、如鬥爭殺伐充乎各單位、則民族有何希望、今我民族已臻復蘇之期、故夫年人事天時、有人壽年豐之現象、如何</p>
<p>求得和平　統一可得和平、不和平卽戰爭、戰爭因割據勢力而發生、九一八前年年戰爭、因割據者蠢蠢思動、三國演義首云、“天下大勢、合久必分分久必合、”此語可包括我國以往歷史、漢武時代之國家威望、唐太宗時代之國族地位、五胡十六國、南北朝、元末、明末之局勢如何、當裂分時、莫不民生塗炭、然而李世民之統一、才產生貞觀之治、朱元璋之統一、才有明初之隆盛、故敢下斷語曰、先統一然後和平、而且我人欲得永久眞實之和平、以統一求得之和平、才不是粉節之和平、才是眞和平、日本明治維新前國內時有變亂維新後實行廢藩、一切權力集於中央、全國統一、日漸復興、故日本之有會日、全賴廢藩運動、打破割據局勢、統一成功、日本之有此統一成功、卽以我王陽明先生之漢學作為基礎、所謂大和魂武十道也者、實卽</p>
<p>尊王攘夷　而已、尊王攘夷乃我國寶、孔子修春秋之精神卽在此尊王者尊中央攘夷者攘胡人、管仲尊王攘夷故孔子稱道之尊王之新名詞卽統一於中央，攘夷之新名詞卽抗敵、故尊王攘夷並非古董、卽所謂統抗敵但不能顚倒謂之攘夷尊王、因為尊王而後能攘夷、統一然後能抗敵、此天經地義也、統一卽所謂安內、抗敵卽所謂攘外、安內而後能攘外統一後才有力量、才能抗敵才能求和平、德相畢斯麥以普魯士偽中心成立統一之普魯士聯邦、而後普奧•普法•之役才能勝利、意大利建國三傑、以畢生心力合併數十小邦、建立統一之新國家、才有今日之地位、豈非統一之力量、</p>
<p>九一八前　我國之史實、不能怨人，乃歷史之必然性、辛亥成功之快速、不能全歸功於革命黨、乃歷史之自然性自秦始皇統一中國、商業資本日漸發展、結果使農村生產者失業日衆、失業者適當時期、卽發生暴動、我國自古迄今、有七八次、如是循環性暴動、外國則以失業者輸送殖民地以安挿之、我國則經過二三百年、失業份子增加、中央失統制力而復演暴動、情末卽走到此一階段、辛亥革命雖成功中央崩潰時期猶未去、故軍閥割據、四分五裂、幸中山先生創設中華民國、並非中華帝國、故軍閥尚不敢稱王作亂、此大幸也由</p>
<p>史的檢討　可知九一八前、當然不能得和平然而羣雄割據之後、一定會統於一、孟子所謂定於二、故不一不得和平、分裂後仍必統一、然而向軍閥求統一、乃不可能之事實、故欲求和平、就需要消滅軍閥割據勢力擁護統一、我人敢下斷語日、除統一外不能求得眞和平，欲求和平、非先統一不可、有人云、要求和平不一定要統一、另有別的方法可想、卽以聯合求和平、此藥方如何、請申論之、英文United乃“聯合”之意、亦可謂之“統一”、Unitcd　Front二字有澤為</p>
<p>聯合戰綫　亦所謂統一戰綫、但聯合與統一有別、我國歷史上之統一、均係一單位、我民族之維持永久、卽藉此精神、如聯合可求和平、則民八時聯省自治之說、何不成功、民四時督軍團之結合、亦求不得和平、因反統一之故、反統一卽不和平、聯合求和平、乃糖衣毒物、有人謂外國亦有聯合的、如北美合衆國、但美國成立後、軍隊•財政•外交·豈非全握中央政府之手•豈如吾國之華北亦有外交委員會乎、我人求統一、消滅割據勢力、其方法有二、卽戰爭興和平、宋太祖杯酒釋兵權、乃以和平方法求和平以戰爭求和平、則不勝枚舉國民革命軍北伐、卽以戰爭求統一、以統一求和平、現在國民政府用和平方法求統一、但中央力量還不够、须靠民衆力量、做到保全軍隊、</p>
<p>化除系統　民衆協助中央做到監督軍人不干地方政治、國軍由中央隨時調防、軍隊與統率者不發生固定關係、如是則消滅割據可用和平方法而成功、用和平求統一、由統一求和平、統一救國運動成功、而國運日降矣、</p>

<h3>上海文藝界座談會詳紀</h3>
<p>中央社云、上海文藝作家洪深•傅東華•邵洵美•葉靈鳳•胡仲持•顧仲彝•等六人、於本月二十九日、邀集全市文藝界舉行座談會、已略誌昨報•計到作家李青崖•傅彥長•等八十餘人、方治•潘公展•洪瑞釗•諸氏、亦被邀列席、席間各作家發表意見至多、對於今後文藝界應努力之方面、尤多所闡述、茲將座談會紀錄整理如次、（如有謬誤由記錄者負責）</p>
<p>邵洵美　今天所請的文藝界的朋友們、差不多都到齊了、我們覺得非常的榮幸、現在兄弟代表六位主人、把今天開會的意思、稍為解釋一下、今天在座的朋友們大都是文藝作家，這“作家”兩字、似乎已成為開玩笑的名詞了、這一方面固然要怪人家不好、但另一方面大概我們自己、也難免有些可使人家開玩笑的地方、多年以來、文藝界在社會上、總沒有得到一個相當的地位、其原因是以往寫文藝的人、大多不定替人歌功頌德、就是作為自己的消遣品、現在時代轉變了文人與社會接觸的機會漸多、以前以為文人無聊現在文人變成有聊、而成為自由職業者了、因為已成為自由職業者、也要像商人一樣要有一個職工會等類的組織、所以我們有組織中國文藝協會的提議、過去上海的作家協會著作家聯合會等、曾經數度組織、但是始終沒有結果、這當然作家們自己應該負些責任的、因為在這種團體之中、往往參雜了別種用意、所以始終沒有結果、今天我們六個人、請各位到會的第一個意義、就是想在這次集會中、能够組織一個健全的文藝協會、謀文藝工作者眞誠的大團結、第二點、方才已經說過、我們是自由職業者、照最近的法令、有職業的人、要負担所得稅、自由職業界所納的所得稅、是特別的重大、約占百分之二十、這問題與我們本身利益關係、是太切了、同時現在一部份毫無道德的出版界、專印翻版書、這件事無形之中、使作家受了很大的影響、多出一部翻版書、就少出一部創作書、這也是作家切身的問題、所以今天開會、第二個意義、就是討論如何保障文藝作家本身的利益問題、復次、我們還有一個當前最大的責任、就是對自己的國家要負起責任來、近幾年來、我們的國家、已有很好的現象、好多年沒有完成的統一、現在已粗告完成了、我們一般文藝界的朋友們應該發表一點意見、一方面使不會寫文章的人、有相當的認識、一方面鼓勵我們的政府、並做政府的後盾、現在各方對於統一救國運動、都有宣言發表、上海的文藝界、還沒有表示、所以我們六個人、擬具了一篇上海文藝界對於統一救國運動的宣言、請各位斟酌、有什麼需要增刪的地方•亦請儘量討論以上幾點、是我們六個人、所以召集道個座談會的意思、今天恰值中央宣傳部部長方希孔先生路過上海、方先生從前也是努力文藝運動的人、所以今天順便請方先生以私人資格來參加本會、發表一點意見，因為方先生遠道而來、現在先請方先生發表意見、</p>
<p>方治　六位主人、各位先生、兄弟此次因事赴杭、路過上海、恰巧六位主人、邀請文藝界同人相聚一堂、兄弟旣不能文又無一藝之長、今天能够參加盛會、實覺得非常榮幸、而且興奮、尤其是聽到邵先生所報告的幾點、都是很值得研究的問題、而且需要各位先生發表宏論的、這幾年以來、我們文藝界同人、不斷的為中國文藝而努力、並且目前文藝界所處的環境、還不免有種困難、兄弟所担任的工作、也同各位一樣是從事於文化事業的、我們的目的與利害、可以說完全相同、所以各位先生所認為要解決的困難、兄弟也應該追隨各位之後、共同奮鬥、並設法解决、兄弟常常有一種感想、就是一個强有力的國家、一方面須靠物質的建設、另一方面須靠精神的建設、精神上的建設、尤其是文化事業、開係最為重大、無論那個强盛的國家、它的文化發展、一定與物質發展相輔並進的、有了這兩種力量、國家的基礎才能鞏固、近數年來、我們的精神建設方面的文化事業、一年比一年進步、文化事業的發展、可以促進物質的發展、這是事實具在、不必列舉、就以一件小事來說、兄弟此次到上海的途中、在火車上偶然買了一本國情畫報、看了一遍、覺得非常的興奮、先前我並不知這本畫報、是什麼人主辦的、只一翻開這本書、完全可以看出中國是一個復興的國家裏面有公民訓練、民衆訓練國家的軍隊、以及綏遠抗敵的情形等等照片、看了之後可以使每一個讀者都非常的興奮緊張、可以知道、現在的中國一切漸有辦法、祗要埋頭苦幹下去、這不過是偶然想到的例子、由此可以知道精神建設、與文化事業、有很大的關係、所以兄弟覺得現在要求中國建立新的中國、一定要努力於新文化運動、精神建設、是超過一切、有了精神建設、物質建設、便不成什麼問題、希望各位共同努力、其次兄弟是從事中央文化事業的一員、很希望各位有意見貢獻給中央、使中央所亟須提倡的文化事業與地方的文化事業、打成一片來、共同發展中國的文化事業、這是兄第最大的願望、上海是中國文化中心、各位先生、差不多都是全國文藝界的領導者、兄弟很願意聽聽各位、對文化事業、尤其是今後文藝運動的意見、現在不想浪費各位寶貴的時間、請各位發表了意見之後、兄弟如有意見、再貢獻一點、請諸位指教、（未完）</p>

<h3>特種現金保證辦法（續）</h3>
<p>銀行公會發表全文</p>
<p>甲乙丙三種保證金之意義及其繳納方法</p>
<p>甲種保證金（月薪額三倍）在取消保人後、必須繳納相當保證金、以資保證、為增厚保障起見、原可規定繳納一年或半年之薪額、惟恐在此社會經濟困窘之際、行員無力籌措、故酌情規定月薪之三倍、較之覓保、便易實多、並將證金利息、特予提高、以息金半數、仍發給行員、如是證金卽等於儲蓄、不致虛擱、其半數撥充公共凖傭金、其本金則另行單獨存儲、於行員離行時全數領回、至繳納辦法、為籌措方便起見、可照下列辦法繳納之、</p>
<p>在行員生、由下列三種辦法籌措繳納、（甲）由行員已繳儲蓄金內撥充三分之一、（如未辦行員儲蓄之行、可由乙丙兩項內、各半繳納、（乙）由年終獎勵金撥充三分之一、（於施行時、酌情預撥、）（丙）分期繳納三分之一、（期限由行方酌定、）、</p>
<p>新進員生、一次繳足、</p>
<p>乙種保證金（月薪額百分之二）　此為取消保人之代替物、亦卽等於團體信用保險之保險費、本無須發還、惟為體䘏行員起見、如無舞弊案件發生、於離行時、可以全數領回、或除攤賠外、收回其餘額、是在保證之中、兼寓儲蓄之意、卽所謂“保證儲蓄”是也、其限額亦屬極低、繳納辦法如下、㊀在已辦行員儲蓄之銀行、可以按月扣存之儲蓄金中、撥繳百分之二、㊁、月薪中按月扣繳、</p>
<p>丙種保證金　行方因行員舞弊而蒙受損失、在行方亦不無責任、故由行方規定、每年撥發若干萬元、其數額可以甲種保證金利息之半數、與乙種保證金全數之和、為標凖、作為丙種保證金、充實保證力量、以示與行員合作甘苦與共之意、其撥充辦法為㊀於開支項下、規定數額撥充、（撥付行員丙種保證金、卽等於團體信用保險之保險費、）㊁於盈餘項下、核定撥充、（提充行員保證凖備）</p>
<p>由上觀之、可證明特種現金保證、辦法施行時、其甲種保證金之繳納、並不稍感困難、其乙種保證金之予以發還、是含有積極作用、同感切身利害、以冀消滅舞弊動機、不若向信用保險公司投保之保險費、”經繳納、形同捐欵之漠不關心也、丙種保證金、為行方决心改進保證制度、以充實保證力量、在相當時間、可由行方核定提出若干、舉辦行員福利設施、以提高行員智德體羣之各方修養、</p>
<p>本辦法復規定“連帶處分”、以促進內部牽制之精神、“獎勵告發”、以收取事前防止之效能、而達防止舞弊之目的、故甲種保證金、雖為月薪之三倍、並不失整個保證之效力、而乙種保證金之繳納、尤為本辦法精義所系也、</p>
<p>“特種現金保證辦法”之優點</p>
<p>一、銀行方面</p>
<p>第一　本辦法施行後、保證凖備金確實、銀行可免除在現行空詞之保單制度下、每年所受行員舞弊之鉅額損失</p>
<p>第二　現行保單制度廢除後、則銀行每年耗費於行員保人之調查、對保文電函件等等鉅額開支、（吾國各銀行、每年關於此項費用、動須鉅額、）可以節省、</p>
<p>第三　現行保單制度廢除後、可免銀行對保人及保人對舞弊者之各種訟累、</p>
<p>第四　為將現行“無限保證”改為“有限保證”、必須將保證金額分別詳細釐定、如規定太少、則保障不足、規定過大、恐陷行員於無法覓保之境地、“特種現金保證辦法”、兼具精神上互自監督之效、自無此種畸重畸輕之缺點、</p>
<p>第五　或謂現行保單制度、能收保人監督行員之功效、惟據事實所昭示、行員保人、半數以上、並不與所保行員同處一地、根據某大銀行統計、保證人與行員異地相處者、佔百分之六十八以上、卽甲之保人在乙地、乙之保人在丙地、况薪的银行人事管理制度、貴在將行員職務、每經相當時间、加以更調、故今年在甲地分行服務者、明年忽調至乙地分行、事所恒有、而保證人萬難隨行員之遷調而更易、是則上述保人監督行員一節、亦殊不盡可靠、况“特種现金保證辦法”之凖備常在、而連帶處分、尤遠勝於保人之監督也、</p>
<p>第六　實行本法、可改進行員之德性、同時卽提高銀行之聲譽、</p>
<p>第七　因相互保證、利害相共、全部行員、非特對於他人能時加審視、卽於本身、亦自能檢束、不致為外物所誘導、卽或稍露不端嫌疑、則各同人均恐遭池魚之殃、自將羣起檢舉、（未完）</p>

<h3>徐益律師訴程霖生妻誣告</h3>
<p>親戚之間纒訟不休　二萬函之公費太多</p>
<p>因被地產大王程霖生之妻程李恬志、及弟李泉源、控告判罪除名之徐益律師、在二十四年間、程李恬志曾照部份之罪告徐益、而由地方法院判刑四月、後上訴江蘇高等法院、宣告無罪、故徐益現在地方法院自訴程李恬志及李泉源誣告、</p>
<p>狀稱事實　程李恬志昔情伊弟李泉源保證、委任自訴人為法律顧問、將及二載、自訴人書面催其給付公費、程李恬志非唯狡賴、抑目與李泉源於去年向釣院誣告、偽造文書等罪、並密託楊紹彭律師、向承審推事譚焯宏賄令、先將自訴人濫權羅押、終則枉判罪弄翤經上訴、始獲平反、業已確定在案故請求辦法、並追私訴損失、如名譽健康業務損害、並涉訟耗費等賠償三萬餘元等語、經法院通知、被告等延李琳律師答辯謂、徐益案公訴、乃李芬檢察官提起公訴、自係就所訴及偵查所得、認為</p>
<p>確有犯罪　嫌疑而為之、如所訴與偵查所得有極端不符、則早被李檢察官提起誣告之公訴、有刑事訴訟法規定該案自訴人被判徒刑四月、至高等法院改判無罪、僅為法律見解與第一審檢察官推事不同、認犯罪之證據不充分而已、自訴人並未提出任伺積極之反證、誣告自不成立、有最高法院二十年第三○七號判例可據至於楊紹彭•譚焯宏•則更屬</p>

<p>親戚之間　挾嫌惟自訴人為公費已有二年、所以函催、詎兩被告誣告鈞院、判決四月、至高院平反、請求治兩被告應得之罪、至在特區法院告行賄不受理、因管轄錯誤請合併審理、至此、問程李恬志供、二十四年十一月十一日高院審理時、他自願拋棄法律願問二萬兩銀子足見他偽造是不錯至此、問李泉深供、並不誣告他、況他是我外甥壻、他妻母為我之姊、為李恬志之妹律師章程上、如何公費</p>
<p>有二萬兩　之多、我為根泰廠經理、他又在廠中帮忙、盜用根泰圖章機會很多、最近他在特一法院辦八個月、釋出未久、亦為根泰之事等語、至此、徐益稱、至於拋棄二萬兩公費、其中有原因、為羅庭長論以程李恬志丈夫已經破產、况我曾借給她們有七萬兩、若云二萬兩為太大、其中有一道理因她丈失有千萬家產、就是她上次告我一件案于、她們用掉一萬餘兩、楊紹彭出一庭公費違四千兩之多、等語庭論改期再訊、</p>

<h3>中華慈幼協會昨舉行第八届年會</h3>
<p>會長孔祥煕氏親臨主持　通過廿六年度工作大綱</p>
<p>中華慈幼協會、於昨日（三十日）下午三時、假博物院路青年協會中山廳、舉行第八屆常年大會、除改選執行委員、報告會務外、並通過臨時提案三欵茲將各情列後、</p>
<p>到會人員　昨日到會會員及來賓、計有孔祥熙•吳鎮城•（李廷安代）潘公展、（張秉輝代）玉一亭•薛萬强•林康侯•毛雲•屈文六•劉瑞恒•趙晋卿•許建屏陳鎮生•等五十餘人、由會長孔祥煕主席、</p>
<p>主席報告　行禮如儀後、卽由孔會長報告詞云、諸位先生、諸位女士、今天是本會舉行第八屆年曾的日子、我們大家都覺得非常的高興、非常的振奮、又有許多嘉賓光臨、本會長和本會的同人、更覺得非常的慶幸、非常的感激、本會成立於民國十七年四月、到了現在、已將近九年的歷史、在過去的九年當中、本會的經費和服務人員、雖然有限、然而同人等黽勉努力、逐步邁進、始終未敢懈怠在過去又蒙社會上許多同情人士的協助、拿他們的精神、拿他們的光陰、拿他們的金錢從各方面加以扶持、本會才能在事工上、表現一點微小的成就、試舉列共顯著的說、如提倡兒童與兒童年舉行慈幼運動大會、與全國慈幼會議鼓勵各地設立慈幼會、轉助新興的慈幼事業、建築南京慈幼實騐區、發起上海市慈幼團體互助委員會、派員考查國外慈幼事業、參加國際家庭教育會議、與遠東禁販婦孺會議、發行現代父母月刊、出版慈幼問題刊物、舉行慈幼問題濱購、進行兒童研究工作、辦理慈幼託兒所、慈幼教養院、慈幼小學校、慈幼診療所、慈幼癆病療養院、舉行兒童衛生運動與兒童健康比賽、辦理虐待兒童案件、保障流浪兒童、促成兒童法律與兒童法庭、救濟各地災童等、不過談到這一些的微小成就、我們不得不歸功於一般慈幼同志的合作、與努力、很希望大家能繼續地合作下去、使得我中華民國的前途、能有更穩固的基礎、諸位、廻想在去年正月、本會舉行第七屆年會的時候、本會長曾說過、我們來進行慈幼的事業、絕對不是僅僅把牠當做一種慈善的事業來辦理的、乃是把牠當做一種社會的救國的事業來辦理的慈善的事業、自然是值得贊許的、不過那到底是屬於消極性質的而不是屬於積極性質的、至於本會所進行的事業、雖然、也有一小部份、是屬於消極性質的、如救濟各地的災童、拯救被虐待的童工婢女等等、但是大部份的事業、却都是屬於積極性質的，譬如提倡兒童節、舉行全國慈幼會議、鼓勵各地設立慈幼會、發行現代父母月刊、出版父母學、父母教育掛圖、舉行慈幼問題講演、進行兒童研究工作、發揚父母教育、舉行兒童衛生運動提倡以最新的科學方法、來教養全國的兒童等、本會的希望、不僅要使全國的兒童能够免於困苦能够免於虐待、並且要使全國的兒童、都能够有健全的身體、都能够有健全的思想、好去创造一個健全的中華民國、這樣說來、本會所進行的事業、自然是一種遠大的救國的事業、而不僅僅是一種消極的慈善的事業了、提倡兒童幸福、自然是我們的直接目的、然而我們的最後目的、却是在藉着提倡兒童幸福、而去促進中華民族的幸福、而去完成中華民國的建設、這一點的意見、很關重要、是我願意在舉行本屆年會的时候、再特别地提出來、向大家鄭重表明的、對於這一點、我想大家一定能加以同情與贊許的吧、諸位、我們在今天討論慈幼的事業、就不能不聯想到我們國家的大勢、我們的中國、在世界上擁有最多的人口、並且佔有極大的面積、據申報年鑑社的統計、我們全國的人口、為四萬萬二一千三百零七萬七千七百八十五人、我們國家的面積、總計為一千一百十七萬三千五百五十八平方公里、約佔亞洲四分之一、全世界陸地面積十五分之一、為亞洲的第一大國、為世界的第三大國、以人口如此之多、面積如此之大、試問為什麼我們的國家、還是這樣地萎靡不振、時常地受到帝國主義者的侵略、不能與其他國家站在平等的地位上呢、唯一的原因、就是因為我們的這個民族、向來不多與外族接觸缺少觀摩、缺少刺激、缺少競爭、所以合羣團結努力奮鬥崇拜領袖發揚威武等等的美德、在我們國家裏面、是不大發展的、物質的文明、卽無基礎、國防的建設、更無從談起及至門戶開放、遇見有組織的外力侵略、於是我們就無所措手足而不免於失敗的結果了、如今為鞏固我們的基礎我們自然應該努力、培養健全的國民、而為澈底地達到我們救國的目的起見、我們就更不得不努力培養健全的兒童、惟獨有了健全的兒童、然後才能有健全的國民、然後才能有健全的國家、慈幼的事業、對於我們國家的前途、具有若何重大的關係、從此可以想見個大概了、從前在列國時代、越王勾踐、敗於吳王夫差、他用上十年生聚十年教訓的工夫、終於戰勝夫差、為國家雪了奇恥大辱、我們要研究歐洲的歷史、也能發見同樣的事實、在十九世紀時、德國經過努力奮鬥、衣戰勝法國舉行凱旋的時候、大將毛奇演說道、“這一次戰勝的榮冠、應當放在小學教師的頭上”這眞是值得我們加以注意的、法國卽敗於德國、受了莫大的恥辱法國人民遂决意雪恥在各處小學校的墻壁上、用硃筆畫上德國侵略法國圖、來養成兒童的雪恥的心理、結果、在五十年之後、發生了世界大戰、戰勝德國、在凡爾賽宮簽訂和約、壓迫德國就範、而洗凈了普法戰爭的羞辱、我們可以知道、凡事在乎人為、只要我們現在能切實地進行慈幼的事業、注重生聚與教訓的工作、我們中國的前途、仍然是非常光明的、發揚國威、或者在十年二十年以後、將來的歷史總會告訴我們的、今天是本會舉行第八屆年會的日子、本會長待為提出慈幼事業的重要性、來和大家共同勉勵、希望日後能有更偉大的發展、不過本會同人的知識有限、能力有限、很願意領受一切慈幼同志的批評與指教、還要請求今天在座的諸位、勿吝賜正、那就是我們所十分盼望的了、（未完）</p>

<h3>古寺鐘聲</h3>
<p>— 沈家千</p>
<p>隔宿的新雪彷彿絨球似的在梅樹枝上靜心着，溪流中結着一層薄薄的水花，偶然有一個水泡從河心里穿過水層，或許是一尾巨鱗的魚想探起頭來尋覓它的食糧，但是戴着蓑衣的漁夫還高臥在茅屋里，他昨夜喝了過量的酒呢。</p>
<p>空山那樣地沉靜着，山巔上廟寺里的鐘聲已經停止不少時候了，小沙彌是慣於愉懶的，只要他們的師傳一下山，他們會大膽下山來打一吊五百的白乾，甚至也會買這麼半個猪頭，潤潤他們蔬菜，蕃薯充塞着的胃腸。他們沒有懂得經卷上深奧的意義，他們也不知道從什麼時候起，要跪倒在蒲團上做那種堅苦的工課。如來是那樣地莊嚴，他的眼睛彷彿就是兩道可以照澈人們肺腑的電炬。看看師傅，却是誠虔地目觀鼻，鼻觀心，幾乎也像一尊肉身的菩薩。大香爐里的貢香，繚繞在大雄寶殿的匾額上，長明燈的芯上綻着燈花，於是小沙彌下意誡地撞着架在樑上的大悲鐘，讓那清澈的鐘聲在山谷里回應着，和着他們喃喃的背誦。</p>
<p>時日把檐角的風鈴毀滅了，這古寺也從興盛的時代到香火寥落了。站在山門外，遙望着接近地平綫上的白雲，村荘好像死一樣地靜止在他們的脚底下，如果沒有野犬的吠聲，這里恐怕眞是接近天堂之路了。小沙彌們和那廟宇同時在生長着，他們已讀得了更多的經卷。晚上，在大殿上做完了夜課，他們默然地跟在師傅背後，讓手里的燭台把他們的影子可怕地映在走廊里，慢慢地向方丈室走去。</p>
<p>師傅似乎永遠沒有疲倦的時候，他坐到鋪着一張老虎皮的太師椅里，荘嚴而精神地講述修成正果的故事，要他們誠虔地不涉遐念，皈依我佛如來。—就是那尊在大雄寶殿上坐着蓮花瓣的金身，他有着两道可以照見人們的肺腑的目光。小沙彌們暂时呆住了，他們的靈魂似乎徘徊在天堂的門外，同時感得自己的頭上發着燦爛奪目的金光，它能够照澈下界凡塵的動態，兩個世界的分野又使他們從幻想中驚醒過來。師傅已經盤膝着閉目養神，芒鞋褪在太師椅的一邊，夜已經深了。</p>
<p>看着燕子在檐下築巢，現在又下雪花的冬天了。師兄弟們偶然談起進廟的日子，實在已經不能追憶了；他們幾乎是在這古寺中生長的，而且也要死在這古寺里，像他們的太師傅一樣，用兩只缸罩着，埋在後山竹林里，那呌做圓寂—但是他們看不見天堂！</p>
<p>太陽爬過了山巔，疏懶地照在寫着四個阿彌陀佛大字的紅照牆上。溪流里的水花溶解了，梅枝似乎更消瘦，晚了，明天大概是個大晴天。</p>
<p>突然，山道上送來了一陣木魚聲，有一個行脚僧朝山巅走來，那是他們的師傳。他虔誠地看着地上，或許在喃喃地宣誦着佛號。背後縛着一塊申牌，一柱細香是永恒不息滅的。山路像人生之路，畸嶇而曲折，新雪化了水，芒鞋里滲了水份，走路是更艱難了。但是那個老和尚是一點也不偷懶地一步一步走着，在誦着佛號的時候，深深地向濘濕的路上拜下去，他的堅苦的信心將要維持到他死去。</p>
<p>鐘聲又在山谷里回響了，香烟繚繞着的大殿上，夜課又開始了。</p>
<h3>鐘</h3>
<p>— 申冰</p>
<p>鐘忍耐着長年的寂寞，用音樂的拍節嗚奏着，鐘的聲樂像是那麽參差，又像是那麽勻净。</p>
<p>慵懶的鐘面是那麽蒼白着臉，以無所事事的眼光對着人們直望。倦於工作的人抬起頭來，它便履行着職務似地說現在是幾點鐘了；但它决不肯說日子過得那般快或是那般慢。</p>
<p>勤謹的鐘擺雖然被關在一個密閉的室子裏，但它有一個透明的窗。透過這窗它可以看見忙碌的人們。它是快樂的，總是左右來回地搖曳着。偶然它也偷取片刻的休息，身子殫無力地垂着，那是由於主人疏忽了用發條把它鼓勵起來。鐘擺並不會埋怨的，也不會貪心着它的伙伴們的安逸。它忍耐着長年的寂寞。</p>
<p>那被囚禁在黑暗的牢房裏的齒輸，也只發出輕微的呻呤，雖則它的工作最繁重。它連透明的窗也沒有，它不知道時刻，永遠是那麼不疲倦地工作下去。它是一個安分的人，不懷着不平的怨懟，因為它的呻吟是輕微的。</p>
<p>鐘的聲樂像是那麽參差，但，又像是那麽勻掙。鐘是一個和協的人。</p>
<h3>荒村</h3>
<p>— 關尹喜</p>
<p>天氣幾乎完全變成沉黑了，雨沒間斷地，凄凄地落着。</p>
<p>四周異样的混亂和朦朧，從那遠遠荒蕪的村莊，已不復如前陣陣透過了稻香和村狗狂飚的吠聲了。那些村子，從前曾經繁榮過，而現在是萎落了，空了。整批年青人拋棄了自己底家園，妻女，為着飢餓和生活，跑向森林地帶和更遼遠的地方流亡去。沒有依倚的，衰弱的孩子和婦女，有些是死亡了，有些被商人們販着走了，有些則到都市里去流浪。廢村里，沒有人聲，也沒有炊烟，剩下的只是些掉失了的野狗，拖長着赤紅的舌尖，垂着尾巴，四隻瘦足架住一副癟乾的肚皮，鼻子伸得長長的，到處奔走，聞着，它們以咀嚼了人們底屍骸和骨頭生活着，慢慢地，骨頭和屍骸也光了，它們中就自相廝殺起來，吃着同類的屍骸和骨頭。當同類底屍骸和骨頭也啃光了時，它們便等着死亡，或到更遠的地方流亡去了。</p>
<p>於是乎，長遠地在這災區里，我們就再也聽不見狗兒的吠呌聲，和人們底呌喊了。</p>
<p>沿着那一條石砌的斜坡，我慢慢的走着，心里盤算還有若干未完成的旅程：因為我覺得我身上所穿和携带的東西，都已透濕了，寒冷聾擊了我，使我禁不住時時要發着抖索。</p>
<p>當我慢慢的爬上一個並不十分高的嶺尖時，有一個坍頹的路亭，就在我底面前兀然地立着，那上面掛着一塊掉了油漆的橫匾，借着陰暗的光綫看着，知道寫的是“七里亭”三字，自己底目地是洛陽，離開這兒尚有十里左右，眼看這樣天氣，要趕十里路程是不可能的。</p>
<p>“我必須找一個地方歇息，歇息……”我想着，又動足走了。“那麽，到什麽地方去呢？”我又問着自己這兒都是荒村啊！“禁不往我失望起來了。</p>
<p>走了約里把路，天色更加陰暗了，就是距離在十幾步遠的東西也看不清。我只感覺着，自已是漸漸地走進了一段陰冷的地段，四周包圍着林木，在雨中抖索着，輕輕的擺動。</p>
<p>忽然，有一縷從林叢里透出來的燈光，把我吸住了，我驚慌得發抖似的對自己呌着：</p>
<p>“有辦法了，這兒住着人家呢！”於是，我便提着發抖的脚，朝光的那邊走去。</p>
<p>在一所舊的孤零的瓦房前我兀然地站着，雨滴敲打在屋瓦上，發出清晰的，淅溚的聲音，我也聽見了自己脈搏跳動的聲音。這聲音，就好像低低的附在我底耳朶旁，說道：</p>
<p>“敲不敲門進去呢？保得住是好人家？……”</p>
<p>終於，我一點猶豫也沒有地跨向前去，用手在木扉上的鐵圈上輕輕的敲着。約過了五六分鐘，我才聽見一陣蹌慢的脚步聲，從裹面走山來。</p>
<p>門，輕輕的開了，一個瘦老的老人，向我連看一看也不地又回着進去，嘴里悲愴地，像對他自己地，低低喃着：“你們什麽什麽都拿去了，什麽都沒有了。……”</p>
<p>我非常的惶惑，我想不顧一切地再回頭走，然而，我沒有那麼大的勇氣，這突然發生的事情太奇異了，我不能一下子走開，我需要完全把它看清。於是，我便也跟蹌地跟在他背後進去。</p>
<p>在小屋子里，豆油燈正在用它陰沉的光閃着，充滿了每一個破損，腐爛的角落。地底下的一角舖着很多稻草，這是作為床用的，在稻草堆上，便躺着一個熟睡的十三四歲少女；但當我仔細看時，我發覺了她底口鼻是給血污塗着的，眼睛微瞇着，泛着白色。</p>
<p>老人在一隻矮凳子上坐着，兩手抱住頭，悽苦地對自己哺語着。</p>
<p>“我說：老總做做好吧，這孩子還少，而且我只有她一個，……但是，你們不久，把她拖着走，跟着我趕了，在山洞里我找到她，但她已經死了，赤身祼體地。……”</p>
<p>我一切都明白了•我明白了這孩子是怎樣死的，這老人是把我看成怎樣一個人，我覺得有向他解釋一下的必要，然而，他沒當我這樣做着時，便狠惡的揚着手，而且呌道……</p>
<p>“現在我我，什麼都沒有了！”他底聲音是那麼地嘶啞，眼淚也接着滴下了</p>
<h3>科學上的大發明玻璃心能使死的肉活着</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>鼎鼎大名的美國飛行家林白大佐，近和前曾得諾貝爾化學獎金的卡萊爾醫學傳士協同發明一種人造坡璃心，已在醫學研究中開啟夢想所不到的可能性。這玻璃心能够把由動物或人類身上割下來的器官，使它全部活着，靠了林白大佐的智慧，達到機械方面的完成。</p>
<p>自從科學家發明提取腺分泌的方法後，只能由活的動物器官中提取極微的分量，那成本是很貴的。現在呢，已能用人工保持器官“生活”的新發明，由器官中大量提取了。醫治糖尿病的印蘇林，和許多其他難症所用的醫治材料，現在都能用和平常咖啡滲濾器形狀相同的玻璃心提出，又快，又便宜。</p>
<p>心病和青春病，將來都可以因研究使器官在化騐狀况下保持它的生活性而解决，這個發明，算得醫學界上一件極有趣味的事。</p>
<p>林白大佐有一次駕了飛機，把紐約洛基菲勒醫學研究處的防肺炎針液送到加拿大貝克，救治奄奄一息的飛行家彭尼特。他在這時和卡萊爾醫學博士第一次會面。博士在醫學界中是很有名望的，他曾在化騐室中把一個雞心，用一種滋養料媒介物保持它的搏動，居然成功，因此得到極大的名譽。他在一九一二年從一隻已死而未冷的小雞腹中取出牠的心，再把那心割下一部分，放在一個玻璃管中，直到今日，那心還在搏動哩。但是博士希望更進一步，保持器官全部的生活和健全，由此產生價值不能限量的腺分泌。他曾一部分解决這個問題，而他的眞正願望，却要造成一種機械心。於是絕頂聰敏的林白大佐便來做博士實騐的助手。</p>
<p>這位最先飛渡大西洋的大飛行家，在洛基菲勒研究處秘密工作了五年，於是世界才知道他已由飛行家轉為醫學研究家。但是他的研究內容，依然不使人知道。他又辛苦了兩年，這才把幕一揭，宣布他的偉大成功。原來他已把卡萊爾博士所未透澈解决的問題整個解决了。他的“玻璃咖啡壺”能够把血或血的代替物供給一個活着的器官，猶如一個眞心一般。他用一個壓緊的“人造空氣”器供給血流的拒動力，這器是要密封着，以防黴菌侵入，因為以前卡萊爾博士自己所試騐的結果，曾被黴菌害死。</p>
<p>這人造玻璃心，一天又一天，一星期又一星期，血液流通着，使它滋養的器官絲毫不露衰弱或腐化之象。</p>
<p>現在已把人的器官用同樣的方法試騐，這個驚人的新發明，差不多天天開啟醫學上研究的新局面。醫學界相信這個玻璃心有無限的功用，有一位美國醫界泰斗說道：“我敢說這種試騐的結果，在今日無論怎麼侈述它的功用，在幾年之內，便要覺得今日所推料的過於謹愼和細微了。”</p>

<h3>國春開映「快發財」</h3>
<p>一部令人絶倒的滑稽片</p>
<p>華納公司出品的「快發財」Hor　Money，是一部帶有浪漫色彩和含有諷刺意味的滑稽片，由漂亮男星羅斯亞立山大及美麗女星琵芙蘭洛勃絲主演，述一化學師，如何把冷水變成汽油，並且穿插一段經理如女書記的羅曼斯，從開幕到閉幕，笑話層層，使人絶倒，今日起，在國泰大戲院公映云。</p>
<h3>文藝作家對於「日出」的批評</h3>
<p>對於我，比起「雷雨」來，「日出」像是更親切一些。在題材上作者已經從暴露大家庭的黑暗面，進而企圖揭開社會的卑汚與惡劣。「靳以」</p>
<p>……説到「雷雨」，我應當告白，虧了它，我才相信中國確乎有了「近代劇」，可以放在巴黎最漂亮的舞台上演出的「近代劇」。在這以前，我雖然看過兩位最優秀的劇作家的劇本的</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>上演，但我總覺得不能和在外國看過的戲劇相比，看了一半，就想退出。祇有「雷雨」，却的確使我衷心折服。……從劇本上，「日出」的確給了我很大的滿足，我更希望在不久的期間內，它能從舞台上給我更大的滿足！</p>
<p>— （黎列文）</p>
<p>……「日出」可以説是一幅都市社會底剪影，從這裏我們看到各階層的人們是如何地生活着，在糜爛的奢淫的生活裏面怎樣活着，在那冷酷的悲慘的生活裏面怎樣死去，被逼死去……作者以他底熱情給我們把那些生動的塲面及生動的人物完全畫出來了；無疑的，作者底才能，像那種磅礴的氣魄，那種熟練的技巧等等，出現在中國劇壇上，簡直可以説是第一次。</p>
<p>— （荒煤）</p>
<p>……如果説「雷雨」是命運的悲劇，則「日出」我們願意説它接近於社會的悲劇，如果我們嫌「雷雨」給我們展開的只是封建家庭的廢圯，那麽我們該承認「日出」給我們托出的却是膿瘡社會的大半面。</p>
<p>— （李蕤）</p>
<p>兩年前讀過「雷雨」，兩月前讀元「日出」。兩劇所對付的都是大問題，而且均以極複雜，極緊張，極嚴密的方法寫出。兩劇均使我深深地感動，使我十分佩服曹禺先生的構思之深，與筆力之雄偉。</p>
<p>— （李廣田）</p>
<h3>大光明映“旋轉乾坤”</h3>
<p>童星金蕙漱新偉搆</p>
<p>童星金蕙漱的演技，在好萊塢許多童星中，確是首屈一指，凡是看過她的作品的朋友，大概都會承認這句話吧。現在，她所主演的新片“旋轉乾坤”CanThis　be　Dixie?，今日起，在大光明公映了。該片由瘦長子桑茂雜爾等六位名。角兩百名美女聯合配演，片中有巨景三幕，華麗絕倫，名歌四支，支支動聽，並且滑稽突梯，笑話百出，的確是一部極有趣味的片子，值得合家大小同往欣賞云。</p>

<h3>Complications Arise in the Handover of Zhang Yang's Troops</h3>
<p>The Telegraph Line Between Tongguan and Xi'an Was Cut Again Yesterday, Troop Increases Were Seen Again Between Chishui and Xiaoyi, and the Longhai Railway is Rushing to Repair Damaged Tracks</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to relevant sources, the 106th Division of Zhang's troops, stationed in the Yangshi and Sunyi areas, twenty li from Wei County, Hebei, had a minor altercation with the takeover troops on the morning of the 30th. The 106th Division opened fire first, resulting in the interruption of telegraph lines in Xi'an and Tongguan. It was later reported that the situation could be calmed. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Due to Yang's lack of sincerity and the emergence of complications, the Zhengzhou-Shaanxi telegraph line was suddenly cut off on the 30th. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Tongguan The situation in Shaanxi has not improved. According to the situation on the 29th, the rebel bandits are still increasing troops in Chishui and Xiaoyi. Telegraph communication was interrupted from 11:00 PM on the 29th to dawn on the 30th. The future situation depends entirely on whether Xi'an complies with the order to withdraw troops before the end of the month. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Qian Zongze, Director of the Longhai Railway Bureau, in order to expedite the resumption of transportation, has specially dispatched Wu Shien, Chief of the Engineering Department, to lead an engineering team to be stationed in Huaxian, carrying a large quantity of bridge materials in preparation for the reconstruction of damaged roads and broken bridges in the Chishui and Weinan areas. Qian also, due to a lack of trains, specially transferred forty-two flatcars along the line, gathered at the Luoyang Machinery Factory, and converted them into third-class trains to meet transport needs. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to the Ministry of Railways, since the Shaanxi Incident occurred, the tracks of the Shaanxi-Tongguan section of the Longhai Railway have been destroyed and passenger trains have been suspended. Repairs were once carried out, but the tracks were subsequently blown up again by Yang's troops. Currently, passenger trains only run to Tongguan, and construction trains run to Huaxian. The damage to the destroyed tracks is very significant, and no accurate statistics are yet available. However, the estimated loss of revenue from passenger and freight transport in recent days is at least over 20 million yuan. The Ministry of Railways is now fully prepared with materials and workers for repairing the destroyed tracks and will find ways to repair and reopen the railway as soon as the situation in Shaanxi is resolved. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to military sources, since strict orders were issued from Xi'an demanding compliance with the Central Government's Shaanxi-Gansu rehabilitation plan, Yang Hucheng and others sent representatives Mi Chunlin and Xie Ke to Tongguan to negotiate with Director Gu Zhutong. Due to divergent opinions on their side, they requested that Zhang Xueliang personally address the troops before any movement could begin. They also requested the issuance of funds for operations and large sums for post-incident rehabilitation, leading to repeated complications. Although there were indications on the 28th that they would immediately begin withdrawing troops from Shangxian, Weinan, Chishui, and positions in the Weibei area, and from the troops stationed by Zhang Yang, there has been no sign of any withdrawal to date, and there are still many outstanding issues. It is difficult to predict what will happen in the future. From 3:00 PM on the 29th, the telegraph lines from Tongguan to Weinan and Xi'an were again cut off. Whether there are other actions being taken on their side is currently under investigation. The Central Government troops entering Shaanxi have been placed under close surveillance. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Lieutenant Colonel Kono, the chief of the Japanese special service agency stationed in Taiyuan, was summoned from his post to Tianjin on the morning of the 30th. He immediately went to the Haiguang Temple headquarters to visit Tashiro and report on the current situation in the Shaanxi Incident. Recently, the Japanese side has paid close attention to the resolution of the Shaanxi Incident and has instructed Kono to return to Taiyuan within a day to conduct close reconnaissance. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Deng Baoshan's Eurasia Aviation plane plans to fly from Lanzhou to Taiyuan to meet with the governor, to discuss the Shaanxi-Gansu events, and then go to Beijing to visit the central authorities and request instructions on everything. The plane flew from Taiyuan to Lanzhou this morning. Ma Hongkui's representative, Kang Yushu, recently came to Taiyuan from Ningxia. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Before going to Shanghai, Chen Duan, Director of the Gansu Department of Finance, issued a written statement, saying that Lanzhou felt quite difficult after the Xi'an Incident. Since Yu Xuezhong returned to Lanzhou, order has been restored, and Central Government personnel in Lanzhou have been treated with utmost protection. All agencies are working as usual. Yu is frank and straightforward, dislikes publicity, and his heart of loving the country and supporting the supreme leader has been consistent. Many people in the Central Government and various parties are well aware of this. However, in the context of Gansu Province and his personal circumstances, he cannot help but reserve some room for cautious speech. The day when his attitude is universally understood may not be far off, and he does not wish to say much more. As for the finances of Gansu Province, they are gradually becoming more organized. Although they have been affected this time, fortunately, there has been no major damage. He is here to report on his duties and will return to Gansu after the matter is completed. (30th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to transportation circles, a large plane flew from Peiping via Taiyuan to Xi'an on the morning of the 30th and arrived in Shaanxi at 2:10 PM.

<h3>Reasons for the Rise in Copper Coin Exchange Rate</h3>

<h3>Wang Asks for Special Amnesty for Those Who Attempted to Assassinate Chairman Lin. Case Handed Over to the Judicial Yuan</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] Wang Zhaoming, a member of the National Government, submitted a request to Chairman Lin on the 29th, asking for a special amnesty for the people involved in the Zhang Yuhua assassination case, in order to show the government's virtue of leniency and allow people to renew themselves. It is now learned that Chairman Lin of the National Government ordered the original submission of Wang on the 30th to the Judicial Yuan for review. The original submission of Wang is recorded below: "Respectfully submitted, Zhaoming was assassinated at the Central Party Headquarters on November 1, 24, suffering three gunshot wounds. He has been entangled in illness and disease, first going to Shanghai for treatment, and then going abroad for recuperation. He has never inquired about the details of the assassination. Knowing that the case has been investigated and tried by the court, he has not expressed his opinions rashly. It is now heard that the case has been adjudicated and the defendants have been convicted. Zhaoming believes that he has no private enemies in his life, but in recent years, he has been in charge of administration, during which time the internal and external troubles have been severely pressing, and his talent and ability have been insufficient to deal with them. The difficulties and twists and turns therein are not easy for everyone to understand. If this has caused misunderstanding, leading to violent acts, although it cannot be excused legally, it is understandable emotionally. May I ask for your understanding and grant a special amnesty to the defendants, in order to show the government's virtue of leniency and allow people to renew themselves. The decision comes from your wise judgment. I am extremely anxious and respectfully submit this to Chairman Lin of the National Government. Wang Zhaoming, a member of the National Government, respectfully submits this." (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Contradictions of Japan Demonstrated in the 70th Diet (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Nanyun</p>
<p>㊀</p>
<p>"Danger! Danger! National livelihood in danger!" This is the cry of the Japanese public, represented by the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun in the "Today's Problem" column.</p>
<p>Amidst this cry of national livelihood in danger, the 70th Japanese Diet opened—on January 21, 1937.</p>
<p>The political battle that had been brewing for a long time between the government and political parties was now entering a decisive phase. Because both sides were taking a hard line, the atmosphere on the first day of the Diet was extremely tense. Due to this tense atmosphere, the government requested the Emperor to issue an edict, suspending the Diet session for two days starting from January 21st.</p>
<p>During these two days of Diet suspension, the movements of the Japanese political situation were limited to the following three points:</p>
<p>㊀ The government's collective resignation. ㊁ Dissolution of the Diet. ㊂ The political parties' surrender to the government.</p>
<p>Based on the current attitudes of the Seiyukai (currently the second largest party in the Diet, holding 172 seats) and the Minseito (currently the largest party in the Diet, holding 205 seats), it is virtually impossible for the political parties to surrender to the current government (surrender to a future government is possible). As for dissolving the Diet, although the military has such a resolution, it is difficult to do so now because the right-wing new party has not yet been formed, and the Diet system cannot be abolished immediately. Therefore, based on the current trend, it seems that the cabinet's collective resignation is the most likely scenario.</p>
<p>However, whether it is the cabinet's collective resignation or the dissolution of the Diet, the political parties' victory is very slim. Judging from Japan's current political situation, the succeeding cabinet will inevitably be a powerful cabinet that is closer to the military and has a more fascist leaning. It is obvious that it cannot be formed without this.</p>
<p>㊁</p>
<p>After the February 26th Incident [February 26 Incident, 1936, a failed coup attempt by radical elements of the Imperial Japanese Army], the prominent characteristic of Japanese politics was the opposition between the political parties and the government. The political parties aimed for a "constitutional norm," while the government was backed by a radical military. In this Diet session, on the surface, it was a battle between the political parties and the government, but in essence, it was a struggle between the political parties and the military. However, the power of this struggle was very limited. Therefore, on the first day of the Diet, Minister of the Army Terauchi and Seiyukai Diet member Hamada Kunimatsu had a very heated verbal battle. The Minister of the Army said that Hamada Kunimatsu insulted the military, and Hamada Kunimatsu asked the Minister of the Army to cite the facts. When Hamada Kunimatsu was responding, the Seiyukai's seats repeatedly applauded and cheered for encouragement. As a result, the Minister of the Army was filled with anger and proposed the dissolution of the Diet at an emergency cabinet meeting at 6:30 PM that day.</p>
<p>Other events, such as the commotion in the Diet when Foreign Minister Arita gave his speech and the Seiyukai Diet member shouting "Shameless" during Maba Tsangtian's speech, are all worth noting in the history of the Japanese Diet.</p>
<p>Originally, since the May 15th Incident [May 15 Incident, 1932, Tokyo, assassination of Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi], Japanese political parties have already entered a period of decline. Parliamentary politics is a product of capitalist society. In the rising period of capitalism, political parties are at their peak in every country. When capitalism enters a period of decline, political parties cannot but enter a downward or revised period. The Japanese political parties at the current stage are taking the path of decline. If they want to change from downward to upward, they must have a great force. But the current Japanese political parties lack this power.</p>
<p>㊂</p>
<p>Because the political parties are heading towards decline, a special phenomenon of the two major political parties uniting to fight for their own interests is manifested in this Diet session. During the "Saito Cabinet" and the "Okada Cabinet," the positions of the Seiyukai and Minseito were different. What about this time? Although there are still differences in the strengths and weaknesses of their proposals, they are generally starting from the same goal of striving for constitutional politics. This is also a rare event in Japanese history.</p>
<p>However, both major political parties represent the interests of Japanese capitalists and landlords. There are differences in the investment sectors between capitalists, and there are differences in interests between capitalists and landlords. Therefore, there are many contradictions within the political parties.</p>
<p>The different attitudes of the Seiyukai and Minseito in the proposal to amend the tax system are obvious. The Seiyukai advocated abolishing the transaction tax and modifying the property tax. The Minseito, however, advocated modifying the transaction tax and abolishing the property tax. This is enough to illustrate the contradictions between the two parties. Originally, the Seiyukai relatively represented the interests of commercial capitalists and landlords in Japan at the current stage (Seiyukai members mostly come from various localities), while the Minseito relatively represented the interests of industrial capitalists in Japanese capitalist society at the current stage (Minseito members mostly come from major cities). A huge budget is a threat to the national livelihood. It is very reasonable for the public's voice to be conveyed through the political parties, and for the political parties to fight with the government by means of this voice. However, from the attitude of the Minseito and Seiyukai opposing the tax system this time, it can be seen that they cannot represent the interests of the Japanese public. Their main purpose is to reduce the burden on some capitalists and landlords and shift this burden to the public as "consumers."</p>
<p>Also, because the Seiyukai still represents the interests of landlords, and at present, landlords are also feeling the oppression of some capitalists, the rhetoric of some Seiyukai members is more forceful and fierce than that of the Minseito. However, because of this, the Seiyukai members who are close to the munitions industry are even more actively carrying out the movement to organize a new party.</p>
<p>In addition to the Minseito and Seiyukai, there are also the Social Democratic Party (18 seats), the National Alliance (12 seats), the Showa Association (25 seats), and the Tokyo Association (9 seats) in the Diet. The Social Democratic Party's remarks are relatively representative of the public, but they only represent it verbally. The Social Democratic Party has rarely taken practical fighting actions. As for the National Alliance and the Tokyo Association, the fascist colors are very strong, and they are also opposed to the political parties. However, the reason they oppose them is that they feel that the government's capabilities are insufficient.</p>
<p>㊃</p>
<p>Since December, the voices emanating from within the political parties, as well as the strong stance of the political parties in the past week, have been so strong that even Hirota, who is "skilled in diplomacy," was unwilling to visit the presidents of the two parties before the Diet session opened (according to Japanese tradition, before the Diet session opens, the Prime Minister must visit the presidents of the two major parties to consult their political views. However, this time, it was formally passed at the cabinet meeting on the 19th that the visits would be stopped). Although this can also be said to be the government's counterattack against the political parties, the strong attitude of the political parties cannot but be said to be a good phenomenon that Japanese political parties have had in recent years. However, from this strength, the internal weakness of the Japanese political parties can also be seen. Since the budget was passed by the cabinet meeting, the prices of goods in thirteen cities including Tokyo in December were about 10% higher than in 1931 (the year of the Manchurian Incident), which is a very serious matter for the general lower classes. The people's grief supports the waist of the political parties, and the momentum of the political parties is naturally very strong. This is the strength of the political parties. However, because the current Japanese political parties cannot truly represent the public, the political parties cannot but give way to the government and compromise with the government in many places. In the current Japan, the enrichment of national defense and the improvement of national livelihood are in fact incompatible. The political parties representing capitalists and landlords, for their own interests, of course, have no choice but to prioritize national defense and sacrifice the public.</p>

<h3>Nation and Democracy</h3>
<p>— Tao Xisheng</p>
<p>For several years, I have not discussed practical politics. The crisis of the nation and the people over the past few years has again made me constantly have an urgent expectation for the nation. This expectation is from a long-term perspective and is from a quiet observation of the general trend of practical politics. This expectation is not from the perspective of daily work in practical politics, nor is it treating hope as fact.</p>
<p>Internationally, China's future is in line with the international peace route of Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Under the watchful eyes of strong neighbors, China has no way but to oppose aggression and expect peace. Needless to say, this peace must be achieved through the defense of armaments and international integration. The United Kingdom, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries have been working hard for world peace for more than a year and have been contacting peace-loving countries or those resisting aggressors for the sake of world peace. There is no doubt that China's future is consistent with them. The relationship between China and the United Kingdom and China and the United States has clearly made great progress over the past year or so. Only the concrete political and economic relationship between China and the Soviet Union remains to be promoted. But in terms of the overall international situation, the rapprochement between the two countries is not a problem.</p>
<p>Due to the consistency of the international anti-aggression route, China's diplomacy has been globalized. If a country wants to add troops to China, there is a substantial possibility of causing a world war. The powerful country that wants to add troops to China has its own great concerns.</p>
<p>China's national wall against foreign countries is becoming stronger day by day. And this solid national wall can enable China to gain some victories in diplomacy. I think this year's diplomacy can be strengthened, and I expect China's diplomacy to be strengthened.</p>
<p>Looking back at domestic politics, although there are many serious internal conflicts that occur from time to time, and there are many people who want to use the serious situation in diplomacy and the national movement to cause internal conflicts, these waves only make those who work in practical politics temporarily excited and discouraged. From the perspective of the general trend of politics, the future of politics is democratic unity.</p>
<p>Unity can strengthen the national wall. Division can destroy the Great Wall of the nation. This is as obvious as it can be. At a time when foreign troubles are enough to destroy the entire nation, revolutionary or government-overthrowing movements are absolutely not tolerated by the people. All the nation's political, economic, and military forces should be concentrated under the government in order to resist foreign aggression.</p>
<p>In order to concentrate the people's strength, the government must adopt democratic methods and systems. The gradual trend of the political system towards democracy over the past few years is undeniable. The unity and progress of various factions within the Kuomintang, the entry of non-party talents into the cabinet, and the preparation for the convening of the National Assembly are all signs of democracy. If it wants to concentrate the people's strength, it is possible and should be possible for the government to follow this existing trend and go further.</p>
<p>Democracy has a certain limit. The government will not and cannot grant opposition parties the freedom to commit acts of violence to overthrow the government. If opposition parties advocate their freedom to commit acts of violence to overthrow the government, then the government's strength will inevitably be used more in stabilizing internal unrest. If we want to jointly consolidate the national wall, opposition parties must sincerely guarantee domestic peace.</p>
<p>However, with the strengthening of the nation's resistance to foreign aggression, the limits of domestic democracy will inevitably be expanded. At a time when the nation is resisting foreign aggression, no opposition party has the possibility of exerting its means of vying for power. At the same time, the government's need for concentrating the people's strength is also increasingly urgent.</p>
<p>Therefore, China's political trend towards democracy is also expanding day by day.</p>
<h3>US Air Cruiser Completes Long-Distance Flight</h3>
<p>Twelve Bombers Prove Air Force Effectiveness</p>
<p>[Washington] Twelve US Navy bombers have completed their flight from San Diego to Honolulu. Secretary of the Navy Swanson called this a "routine delivery."

<h3>Hitler Announces Domestic and Foreign Policy to the Reichstag</h3>
<p>Never to Invade Belgian and Dutch Neutrality, Economic Self-Sufficiency Without Seeking Foreign Aid, Hoping for Cooperation to Resolve the European Situation</p>
<p>[Berlin] Today, in a speech commemorating the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, Führer Hitler announced the nationalization of the Deutsche Bank and the national railways, and explained Germany's departure from the restrictions of Paris. Amidst the cheers of the crowd, Hitler said, "I solemnly announce the cancellation of all clauses in the peace treaty that attribute the responsibility for the European War to Germany. The era that shocked us has come to an end. I consider the restoration of the glory of us Germans, such as the restoration of conscription, the creation of the air force and the new navy, and the occupation of the Rhineland area, to be the most thrilling work of my life. I do not take credit for the above matters; I should thank the power of God for restoring the glory and integrity of our country." (Reuters, 30th) Hitler then elaborated on Germany's relations with various foreign countries, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Between Germany and France, there is no longer any object that could cause disputes between the two countries.</p>
<p>(2) The German government should declare to Belgium and the Netherlands that Germany is prepared to always guarantee that Belgium and the Netherlands are regarded as neutral countries and will never invade them.</p>
<p>(3) British Foreign Secretary Eden recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, hoping that Germany would abandon its self-sufficiency policy and seek economic cooperation with other countries. We now reply to this: Germany does not intend to abandon the Four-Year Plan. Germany cannot rely on the aid promised by foreign countries to determine its future. Germany can only rely on the products that can be sold domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>(4) Germany believes that Bolshevism is a scourge of the world. We have tried various methods to avoid this scourge. If we conclude a new treaty with Soviet Russia in the future, it will be of no value to us. To say that the National Socialist Germany can take on the responsibility of protecting Bolshevism is simply inconceivable. As for accepting the assistance of Bolshevik countries, it is not what we want. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>Hitler then outlined the following eight-point policy for stabilizing the overall situation in Europe:</p>
<p>(1) The stability and order of the domestic political and economic situation.</p>
<p>(2) Various peoples respect each other's major interests.</p>
<p>(3) The League of Nations must be reorganized to become an institution of evolving ideas.</p>
<p>(4) International regulations must be formulated on the basis of absolute equality.</p>
<p>(5) Adopt a realistic view of arms limitation.</p>
<p>(6) If irresponsible international parties are allowed to continue inciting without being stopped, peace can never be maintained.</p>
<p>(7) European problems can only be solved to the extent possible. Germany hopes to have a close friendship with Italy and is willing to</p>
<p>Eliminate all obstacles in the future so that the same close relationship can occur with other countries.</p>
<p>(8) When discussing the issues of ethnic minorities, national honor must be respected. Hitler acknowledged that when Germany occupied the Rhineland area, Britain did its best to avoid the tension of the situation. Hitler concluded by saying, "We are willing to solve several of these problems in the most natural way, and that way is to actually build good relations between our country and its neighbors. Now that Germany's sovereignty and equality have been restored, we will never sign treaties that are not commensurate with our national honor, because such treaties cannot be preserved in the end. Peace is the most precious treasure for us."</p>
<p>Hitler also said, "Germany and other countries are on an equal footing, and they are aware of their responsibilities in Europe and will cooperate sincerely to solve various international problems." (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Summary of Hitler's Speech</h3>
<p>Deutsche Bank and National Railways Nationalized, Reichstag Passes Extension of Dictatorial Powers for Four Years, Orders Germans Not to Receive Nobel Prizes</p>
<p>Hitler further said that it is regrettable that outsiders mistakenly believe that Germany intends to isolate itself voluntarily. It must be known that no country in the world will express political disinterest in the affairs of other countries. If the world is as small as today's Europe, then the above situation should be even more certain. Hitler then told the Reichstag that Germany is extremely friendly with Poland, Austria, Italy, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Greece, Portugal, and Spain. The conclusion of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany clearly shows that Germany has no intention of voluntarily falling into isolation.</p>
<p>Hitler also said, "I solemnly declare that there is no point of contention that can be imagined between Germany and France, and we have guaranteed to the silver countries of the Netherlands and Belgium that we will recognize their permanent neutrality. Germany has no intention of abandoning international cooperation economically. In the past few months, the speeches of most politicians have given the world the impression that the whole world will provide economic assistance to Germany, but the Germans have stubbornly refused it. Since 1932, Germany's overseas trade has not decreased, but has increased. However, I believe that, apart from a new basis for the exchange of goods, I do not believe that there is more lasting economic cooperation. The world's economy has been affected by the biological confusion of various countries and their interrelationships. Germany has no responsibility for this. It must be known that the world economic panic in 1932 was indeed greater than today. The implementation of Germany's Four-Year Plan is indeed a last resort. I will never build a future country on the guarantees of foreign politicians or international aid, but must rely on the true facts of production."</p>
<p>Hitler regretted that Britain did not adopt its current attitude towards European unification earlier, and then said that the Treaty of Versailles no longer exists. Hitler continued, "From Eden's point of view, Bolshevism may be a matter of setting up its base in Moscow, but from our point of view, this doctrine is a great disaster and has tried to make our country desolate like Spain."</p>
<p>Hitler said that he had made three specific proposals to limit armaments, but all were rejected. The most important of these was that France and Germany should reduce their armies to 300,000 men, and Britain and France should reduce their air forces to an equal level. Germany and Britain should conclude a naval agreement. Only the last move has been accepted. Eden is convinced that each country should only have the armaments necessary for its national defense. Eden has consulted with Moscow on the realization of this good doctrine. May I ask what guarantees he has obtained from Soviet Russia? Now only Germany can determine its own defense needs. Italy and Japan share this view. If all of Europe can know this, then he will be even more pleased. Germany welcomes the reduction of tensions in the Mediterranean as a result of the British-Italian agreement. This move can at least limit the disasters descending on Spain. Germany has no other relationship with Spain other than cultivating economic relations. Eden has called this kind of economic relationship important and beneficial. Recently, there has been a tendency to say that Germany's sympathy for the Spanish National Army has a colonial plan. It must be known that Germany has no colonial demands on countries that have not occupied German colonies. Dividing the world into parts that should and should not be divided cannot solve the colonial problem. If the League of Nations regards judging the current state of the world and abandoning it permanently as its work, it is better to accept controlling the trend. The continued existence of Germany depends on its realization that it must consider the necessary reforms regarding relations between countries and implement them. Germany should not require colonies for military use, but will only provide them for economic use. Our country is densely populated, and colonial demands will eventually be made.</p>
<p>Hitler then mentioned domestic affairs, and after briefly mentioning the political achievements of the past four years, he asked the public, "Who can compare today's Germany with the Germany of four years ago?" He also asked whether the world has ever had such a thorough revolution, even if most former political civil servants were not disturbed, and then granted their greatest enemies with pensions. He continued, "However, our policies have never been greatly used in other places. A few months ago, a very prestigious Englishman protested to us the detention of one of Moscow's greatest criminals in a concentration camp. I don't know whether he protested the burning and killing of tens of thousands of men, women and children in Spain. Judging from the fact that 100,000 people were killed in the Spanish civil war, we also have the right to do so if the National Socialist revolution killed 400,000 to 500,000 people. Guiding one's own country to know that the greatest and most solemn work for human beings is to preserve the race. This is indeed the first time in human history. This is not to guide countries into disputes, but to guide countries to a common understanding for the first time. This also prevents Jews from trying to wear the masks of pure and good middle-class society to split and control other nations. The National Socialist revolution is so great that its spiritual foundation has not been understood by the world to this day. There has never been a society more glorious and beautiful and with true democracy than National Socialism. National Socialism makes it possible for every child to reach the position of leader of a country.</p>
<p>Four years ago, the number of unemployed people in the country reached six million, and farmers seemed to be on the verge of extinction. Today, you should admit that the promise to save them has been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Hitler then mentioned the unspeakable catastrophe Germany suffered in its two thousand years of history, and criticized the self-help behavior of economic commentators, who began to talk about the collapse of the economy when they saw the devaluation of a banknote. He acknowledged that he was not an economist and had never been an idealist. Hitler continued, saying that saving our people is not a financial problem, but a job problem. On the one hand, we should guide the existing labor force, and on the other hand, we should reclaim land and develop mining profits. If the leaders of economic life cannot do these things, then the state has to take steps to give the existing artificial labor a considerable employment. In addition to ordering 12 million man-hours to be abandoned every year, the state can do everything possible. The Four-Year Plan is indeed the most solemn expression of this kind of orderly guidance of our economic life, and it enables workers who are separated from the arms manufacturing industry to obtain permanent jobs. There is still a lack of trained workers in many industries. This is one of the most noteworthy things in Germany's great economic development.</p>
<p>Hitler's speech lasted for two hours and then he ordered Germans not to receive Nobel Prizes. Then, the Reichstag unanimously passed a bill to extend Hitler's full powers for four years. This bill was proposed by Interior Minister Dr. Frick, and was passed by the members with a show of hands, and General Göring was elected to continue to serve as speaker of the Reichstag. It is said that Hitler's speech was completely drafted by himself, and even his most trusted confidants did not participate in the discussion. Hitler suffered from a sore throat during his speech and coughed several times. Hitler declared to the Reichstag that he often did not seek the opinions of the former enemy countries on certain necessary measures, or even notify them, but implemented them decisively, because he thought that this would make it easier for the other party to accept them. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The German people are enthusiastically celebrating the fourth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, and an atmosphere of eager anticipation is spreading across the country. By noon, the atmosphere had changed dramatically. Shops and agencies stopped working to prepare to listen to Chancellor Hitler's speech to the people of the country in front of the seven hundred and forty-one members of the lower house.</p>

<h3>Soviet Russia Sentences Thirteen to Death in Party Prison</h3>
<p>Radek and Two Others Sentenced to Ten Years' Imprisonment, Defendants' Faces Are Pale When Hearing the Verdict</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Russian treason case, after a public trial by the court, was sentenced today. A total of seventeen defendants were sentenced, thirteen to death, three to ten years' imprisonment, one to eight years' imprisonment, and four were exempted from the death penalty. The four who were exempted from the death penalty were Radek, a famous Soviet Russian political commentator, former Ambassador to the United Kingdom Sokolnikov, Anor, who had served as a Hollywood movie actor and admitted to attempting to assassinate People's Commissar Molotov, and Storolov, who had been sent to Germany to hire German experts to work in Soviet Russia. The above three defendants were all sentenced to ten years' imprisonment, and Storolov was sentenced to eight years. The thirteen defendants sentenced to shooting are as follows: former Deputy Commissar of Heavy Industry Bitakov, former Director of the Middle East Railway, Sili Bailaikov, former Commissioner of Agriculture and Army, and once aide-de-camp to Trotsky, Melarov, former Director of the Soviet Russian Railway Bureau, Lipushisky, Trobanis, who served as a witness in the trial of German engineer Stickling in November last year, former Director of the South Ural Railway Bureau, Knaziv, and Geslavsky Katakek, Nokin, Sisto, Gerasimov, Dushin, and Dulloque. About 400 people from the public were present in court. The defendants were escorted to the court to hear the verdict with dejected expressions. When Chief Judge Ulri rushed to the seat, the entire court stood up to pay their respects. Ulri then began to read the verdict. The defendants all stood still. When they heard the sentences imposed on them, their faces were pale. The crowd was eager to know Radek's fate. When the judge announced the names of the defendants who were found guilty, the atmosphere in the court became tense. After the judge announced the adjournment, the defendants were escorted out by armed guards. The audience in the court cheered and expressed satisfaction with the verdict. Although this case has attracted public attention, there are no people gathered outside the court waiting for the announcement of the verdict. People were generally surprised that Radek and the other four were spared the death penalty, because it was originally thought that none of the defendants would be spared the death penalty, especially since Radek never pleaded for mercy, and it was even more expected that he would die without a doubt. The court's reasons for sparing Radek and the other four from the death penalty are that although they committed various crimes, they did not actually participate in genuine terrorist activities. It is also heard that the property of all the convicts will be confiscated. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Verdict Main Text</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The main text of the verdict states that, in 1933, according to the direct instructions of Leon Trotsky, a public enemy banished abroad in 1929, a secret anti-Soviet Trotskyist parallel center organization was successfully established in Moscow, alongside the so-called "Trotskyist Terrorist Center" existing at the time, including Zinoviev, Kamenev, and Smirnov. This organization included the defendants in this case, Pyatakov, Radek, Sokolnikov, and Serebryakov.</p>
<p>According to the instructions of the public enemy Leon Trotsky, the anti-Soviet Trotskyist parallel center formulated its main tasks as overthrowing the Soviet regime, restoring capitalism and bourgeois rule, and applying sabotage, subversion, espionage, and terrorist activities to destroy the economic and military power of the Soviet Union, promote armed aggression against the Soviet Union, and aid foreign aggressors to defeat the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>In complete accordance with this main task, in addition to the public enemy Leon Trotsky abroad, the anti-Soviet Trotskyist parallel center, represented by Radek and Sokolnikov in Moscow, held negotiations with individual representatives of Germany and Japan. When the public enemy Leon Trotsky negotiated with Rudolf Hess, one of the leaders of the German National Socialist Party, he promised that after the Trotskyist government seized power due to the defeat of the Soviet Union, it would sacrifice the Soviet Union by granting political, economic, and territorial concessions to Germany and Japan, even ceding Ukraine to Germany, and the Primorsky Krai and Heilongjiang Province to Japan.</p>
<p>At the same time, the public enemy Leon Trotsky also promised that upon seizing power, he would abolish state-owned farms, disband collective farms, abandon the national industrialization policy, and restore capitalist relations within the Soviet Union. In addition, the public enemy Trotsky also admitted that in peacetime, especially when aggressor nations launched armed aggression against the Soviet Union, he would use methods such as spreading defeatist propaganda, carrying out sabotage, subversion, and espionage activities, to help these aggressor nations as much as possible.</p>
<p>The members of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist parallel center, Pyatakov, Radek, Sokolnikov, and Serebryakov, carried out the instructions of the public enemy Trotsky, launching sabotage, subversion, espionage, and terrorist activities. These instructions were repeatedly received personally by Radek and Pyatakov during a meeting with the public enemy near Oslo in December 1935. To direct anti-Soviet activities locally, local Trotskyist center organizations were also established in several major cities in the Soviet Union, most notably the Western Siberian anti-Soviet Trotskyist center in Novosibirsk, which was formed under Pyatakov's direct instructions, including the defendants in this case, Muralov, Boguslavsky, and Drobnis. The sabotage and subversion work in the industrial sector, especially in enterprises of national defense importance, as well as in the railway sector, was carried out by the defendants in this case in accordance with the direct instructions of the public enemy Trotsky, as well as the tasks assigned by the representatives of the German and Japanese intelligence agencies, and was jointly and directly participated in by these representatives. These activities were aimed at disrupting production plans, reducing the quality of output, and organizing arson and explosions in factories, factory departments, and mines, as well as organizing train derailments and destroying railway vehicles and tracks.</p>
<p>When organizing this subversion work, the defendants' starting point was based on the instructions of the public enemy Trotsky: "strike forcefully in the most sensitive areas," supplemented by the instructions of Pyatakov, Livshitz, and Drobnis: do not hesitate to harm human lives, because "the more sacrifices, the better, as it can arouse the workers' resentment."</p>
<p>The verdict continues to detail the crimes committed by the defendants Taiqi Ke and Puxin in the chemical industry under Pyatakov's instructions, the crimes committed by the defendants Drobnis, Norkin, Hestov, and Stoylov in coal mining and the chemical industry of the Kuznetsk Basin under the instructions of Pyatakov and Muralov, and the sabotage and subversion work carried out by the defendants Serebryakov, Boguslavsky, Livshitz, Knyazev, and Tulok in the railway sector. The defendant Knyazev, under the orders of Livshitz and a representative of the Japanese intelligence agency, caused multiple derailments of cargo, passenger, and military trains, resulting in casualties. Pyatakov and Serebryakov, under the direct instructions of the public enemy Trotsky, prepared to carry out various subversive activities in important industries related to national defense and on the most important railways during armed aggression against the Soviet Union. Norkin, under Pyatakov's instructions, prepared to set fire to the Kemerovo chemical plant when war broke out. Knyazev, under Livshitz's instructions, accepted the orders of a representative of the Japanese intelligence agency to try to bomb railway structures, burn military supply depots and military grain supply stations, and destroy military trains in the event of war, and even openly spread bacteria to poison Red Army troop transport trains, military grain supplies, and sanitary stations, causing severe infectious diseases.</p>
<p>In addition to subversion and sabotage work, the defendants Livshitz, Knyazev, Tulok, Stoylov, Hestov, Lataike, Puxin, and Grashi, under the orders of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center, also collected extremely important state secret information and transmitted it to representatives of German and Japanese intelligence agencies. The defendants Lataike, Puxin, and Grashi were connected with the representatives of the German intelligence agency, Meierlovich and Lenz, and provided them with special secret materials on the situation and work of the chemical industry from 1935 to 1936. The defendants Hestov and Stoylov colluded with the representatives of the German intelligence agency, Sibesdo, Feilesa, Floren, Shamairleg, and others, and provided them with secret information on coal mining and the chemical industry in the Kuznetsk Basin. The defendants Livshitz, Knyazev, and Tulok regularly supplied a representative of the Japanese intelligence agency with absolute secret information about the technical situation, counter-mobilization preparations, and troop transport of the Soviet railways.</p>
<p>The anti-Soviet Trotskyist center, under the instructions of the public enemy Trotsky, also organized many terrorist groups in Moscow, Leningrad, Kyiv, Rostov, Novosibirsk, Suchi, and other Soviet cities, preparing to assassinate party and government leaders Stalin, Molotov, Kaganovich, Voroshilov, Ordzhonikidze, Zhdanov, Kussir, Aksilbosdigev, and Beria. Several of these terrorist groups (Moscow, Novosibirsk, Ukraine, and the Transcaucasus) were directly directed by Pyatakov and Serebryakov. In mid-August 1934, when Molotov was going to the Kuznetsk Basin, Hestov, under Muralov's orders, attempted to assassinate Molotov. For this purpose, he sent Anold, a local Trotskyist terrorist, to try to cause an accident to the car Molotov was riding in. In addition, Hestov, under the orders of Pyatakov and Muralov, plotted to assassinate Aksil, the secretary of the Communist Party's Western Siberian Regional Committee, while Anold, under Hestov's instructions, attempted to assassinate Ordzhonikidze.</p>
<p>The verdict continues to prove the crimes committed by each defendant individually and the criminal provisions under which they were charged. According to these provisions, the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union sentenced the defendants Pyatakov and Serebryakov to death by shooting for acting as members of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center, organizing and directly directing treasonous espionage, subversion, sabotage, and terrorist activities.</p>
<p>The defendants Muralov, Drobnis, Livshitz, Boguslavsky, Knyazev, Lataike, Norkin, Hestov, Dunlok, Puxin, and Grashi, who acted as organizers and direct executors of the above-mentioned criminal activities, should be sentenced to death by shooting.</p>
<p>The defendants Sokolnikov and Radek, who acted as members of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center and were responsible for its criminal activities, but did not directly participate in the organization and execution of subversion, sabotage, espionage, and terrorist activities, should each be sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. The defendant Anold should be sentenced to ten years of imprisonment. The defendant Stoylov should be sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. Sokolnikov, Radek, and Stoylov should each be deprived of their civil rights for five years.</p>
<p>The public enemy Leon Trotsky and his son Sedov were expelled from the Soviet Union in 1929, and their Soviet citizenship was revoked by a resolution of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union on February 20, 1932. Their direct command of the treasonous activities of the anti-Soviet Trotskyist center has been confirmed by the confessions of Pyatakov, Radek, Hestov, and Muralov, the testimony of witnesses Lom and Bukharov, and the evidence in this case. They should be immediately arrested and handed over to the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union for trial if they are found within Soviet territory.

<p>[Tokyo] General Yoshijika Kawashima visited General Hayashi, the head of the cabinet formation, at the cabinet formation headquarters at 2:35 PM today. He later told people that General Hayashi had already decided on the policies and political outline of the new cabinet. He also had the opportunity to review them and said that they seemed to be based on the fundamental principles of the Army authorities' new proposals.

<h3>Britain and France Borrow 40 Million Pounds</h3>
<p>Agreement Signed</p>
<p>[Paris] Several large British banks, led by Rothschild Brothers Bank and Morgan Grenfell &amp; Co., have lent a huge sum of 40 million pounds to French railway companies. The loan agreement was signed tonight, with a term of ten months and an interest rate of 3.5%. The entire amount has been allocated by British banks, and the bonds will be kept and not circulated on the market. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>[London] After the French loan agreement was concluded in Paris tonight, financial circles here expressed satisfaction, believing that although the French Treasury is temporarily experiencing financial difficulties due to the sluggish tax revenue, the current loan has been established, so its financial resources can be activated, pending the recovery of tax revenue in the coming months. In addition, the financial cooperation between Britain and France can also be clearly demonstrated by the establishment of this loan, and the speculators' attempts to break the front created by the tripartite monetary agreement between Britain, France, and the United States are ultimately futile. Financial circles are also optimistic about the French currency situation. At this time, the spot exchange rate of the franc against the pound has risen from 105.15 francs to 105.14 francs, and the futures rate has risen from 108.15 francs to 107.77 francs. It is generally believed that the establishment of the French loan from Britain and the increase in the discount rate of the Bank of France are the reasons for the appreciation of the franc. In addition, the market prices of various French government bonds on the stock exchange have also risen. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>France and Germany Begin Preliminary Trade Agreement Negotiations</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The representative of the French Ministry of Commerce, Alphand, arrived here today to conduct preliminary negotiations on the German-French trade agreement. Financial issues will be discussed first. When Germany and France settle accounts, Germany still owes France about 1,100,000,000 francs. The French government is very interested in concluding a tourist transport agreement so that 60,000 Germans, each carrying an average of 5,000 francs in checks, can go to Paris to visit the World Expo in May. However, Germany currently needs all foreign exchange to purchase food and raw materials, so the French government's wishes are difficult to realize. It is generally believed here that France will send another representative to Berlin in February to actively conduct negotiations. (KMT dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Spanish Rebels Will Discuss Commerce</h3>
<p>Formal Trade Agreement Postponed</p>
<p>Salamanca According to news from Yun Tong, the German government and the Spanish Nationalist government will send economic experts to begin discussions in the near future to adjust commercial relations. It is said that a clearing agreement will be concluded first. The current trade agreement between Germany and Spain was signed by the Madrid government, and Germany no longer recognizes that government, so these negotiations should be interpreted from a legal point of view. It is said that the purpose of these negotiations is to clarify the situation, and whether the timing of the signing of a formal trade agreement is ripe depends on the results of these negotiations.

<h3>Shandong Match Factories Oppose Expanded United Association</h3>
<p>Factory Representatives Petition in Jinan for Days, Issue Declaration Exposing Truth of Dispute</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Match factories in this province have long opposed the monopolistic control of the National Match Production and Sales United Association. Recently, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry jointly decided to order factories to join the association by a deadline, or else their registration would be revoked and licenses would be suspended. This has further placed the factories in dire straits. Shandong has the most match factories in the country, so the stakes are highest there. Eighteen match factories, including those in Qingdao and Jinan like Luxi, have jointly petitioned their local governments to uphold the Ministry's decision to change the resolution. In Jinan, representatives such as Li Jianzhai and Yu Jiesan have been visiting Governor Han Fuqu of the Provincial Government and Director Zhang Honglie of the Construction Department for days. In addition to submitting documents, they have verbally presented evidence of the United Association's control and subservience to foreign interests, such as Article 37 of the association's charter: "The association's working capital is set at 5 million national currency, to be paid by members in proportion to their production within the time limit set by the association." This 5 million working capital should be borne by more than 70 factories. Furthermore, it is estimated that the factories have about 1,000 machines, which means each machine would have to bear 5,000 yuan, and if they don't pay, they will be forced to withdraw. Not many match factories have large capital; often, they have eight machines but only 20,000 yuan in capital. If they have to pay the capital, they would still have to owe 20,000 yuan. Now, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry have ordered them to join the association by February 1st, or else their registration will be revoked and their licenses will be suspended. Joining the United Association is death for the factories, and not joining is also death. Furthermore, the United Association restricts the production of Chinese merchants. For example, the 18 factories currently have 150 machines and produce 300 large boxes (40 yuan per box). According to the restriction, they can only produce a little more than 100 boxes. How can they survive? At the same time, the agreement stipulates that Japanese merchants are allowed to increase production by 110,740 large boxes per month. Of the six Japanese factories, three have already closed down, leaving only three. If Japanese merchants are allowed to increase production by this amount, not only will the three closed factories be revived, but several more will be allowed to be established. What is this if not subservience to foreign interests? Currently, all 18 factories are in Shandong, directly and indirectly employing tens of thousands of people. If this method is followed, the 18 factories will have to close down entirely. The factories are not to be pitied, but the unemployment of hundreds of thousands of people is a major problem. The provincial government and the Qingdao municipal government both recognize that this problem is very serious and have decided to work together to find a solution. Director Zhang Honglie of the Construction Department has telegraphed Liu Hongsheng, the person in charge of the United Association, asking him to come to Jinan or Qingdao to hold a meeting with the match factories to discuss a solution. However, as of the 28th, Liu had not replied. It is said that if Liu holds a meeting in Qingdao, Zhang Honglie will go to Qingdao to participate in the meeting. If Liu holds a meeting in Jinan, Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie will come to Jinan to participate.</p>
<p>Attached is the declaration issued by the factories on the truth of this dispute: "Reluctant to be slaughtered and striving for survival is the motivation for the establishment of the joint office of our 18 factories, and it is also the goal of our 18 factories' joint office in its unremitting struggle with the National Match Production and Sales United Association. However, after years of struggle, limited by manpower, financial resources, and various other factors, it has not been resolved. The association has engaged in malicious propaganda to deceive people, fearing that people from all walks of life will not understand the truth or suspect that the opposition to the United Association is for private gain. Therefore, we sincerely present the inside story of the United Association's organization and the attitude and struggle of our 18 factories to the people of society, asking for sympathy and assistance, and appealing to the government, hoping to obtain a fair and appropriate solution so that national industry will not be prematurely cut short by accidental destruction. In March of last year, the All-China Match Industry Federation convened the second temporary representative meeting. The notice did not mention the establishment of a United Association. Many manufacturers from afar thought it was a normal routine meeting and entrusted representatives from other factories to attend. On the 18th of the same month, the United Association's plan, charter, and the planned directors, supervisors, general managers, and deputy managers of the branch offices were suddenly proposed at the meeting. It was also publicly announced that they had been submitted to the ministries for record, and that the Chinese and Japanese sides had agreed that no changes could be made. The merchants and most members believed that the United Association was a free association among the industry, which has a skin-to-skin relationship with each factory. However, they were not informed of anything beforehand. After reading the charter and agreement, they found that many of them violated the law and ceded rights. Therefore, with the qualifications of the industry, they put forward opinions, first asking the Qingdao branch to take responsibility, and then sending representatives to Shanghai to request the head office to amend them. After running around and negotiating, they were not understood by the association. In the end, they had to expose the inside story, state the reasons in detail, and appeal to the ministries and provincial and municipal governments for amendments. The association did not reflect on itself, but presented a vague report to the government, destroying the head office in a few days, hoping to seize the position, overturning the United Association immediately, and using various slanders to counter them to facilitate private gain, causing the United Association's business to fall into a stalemate. Until January 9th of this year, we received a letter from the head office of the United Association, stating that the representative of the Ministry of Finance had telegraphed, stating that on November 16th and 17th of the 25th year, the Ministry convened the Ministry of Industry to send personnel to a meeting at the Tax Affairs Department, and notified the responsible personnel of the association to attend and explain. After the two ministries held a meeting, it was decided that all Chinese match factories must join the United Association before January 20th of this year. If they have not joined the association by February 1st, the Ministry of Industry will revoke their registration, and the Ministry of Finance will stop selling flower stamps and issuing licenses, and will not give any further grace period. The telegram ordered the association to forward it to our 18 factories for compliance. This is the inside story of the organization of the United Association and the story of the struggles of our 18 factories. Please recognize the society, don't be obscured by the smoke screen of the United Association. The inside story of the association is as described above. Now, let's analyze the contents of its charter and agreement. Let's not talk about other things, let's just take the most obvious drawbacks. For example, Article 37 states that the association's working capital is set at 5 million national currency, to be paid by members in proportion to their production within the time limit set by the association. Article 45 states that in the event of losses, they will still be borne by the members and deducted from the goods payment that should be received by the members. In addition, the association's annual expenses are more than 1 million, and the start-up costs are not small, all of which are borne and supplied by the members. It is a huge amount to pay, and there is unlimited liability for the shares. What guarantee is there? What is it for? Isn't it deliberately making it difficult for small factories to force them to close down? Another example is Article 34, which states that the voting rights of the members' meeting are calculated according to the production ratio. Article 33 states that if the resolution of the members' meeting is still inconsistent with the position of the board of directors of the head office after applying for reconsideration, the board of directors of the head office will resolve it in consultation with the China Match Industry Federation. Article 15 states that members, except for self-dissolution or loss of manufacturing rights, may not request to withdraw from the association for any reason. Once they join the association, they are sentenced to death. There is no room for expressing opinions, and there is no possibility of withdrawing. As for the formulation of the production ratio and calculation method in Articles 3 and 10•11, and the conditions of agreement with the Japanese side, it is even more heartbreaking that foreign factories are given special preferential treatment, while Chinese factories are arbitrarily discounted and exploited. Furthermore, the directors and supervisors of the association are all designated by private individuals, and there are no alternate directors and supervisors. It is unnecessary to argue that its organization is illegal. As for its managers and important staff, they are all monopolized by private individuals. If they go their own way like this, who will be responsible if there is any corruption? This is why the merchants have never dared to agree. In short, the reason why the 18 merchants and factories have carefully considered and dare not join the United Association is that the motivation is entirely caused by the collusion of a few powerful manufacturers with foreigners to destroy the industry and create a monopoly policy, and small factories have no possibility of survival. However, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry only convened the responsible personnel of the United Association to attend and explain at the meeting in November last year, and did not notify our manufacturers to express their opinions. Of course, only one side of the story was presented. It is no wonder that the association was able to present a vague report with exaggerated words and malicious speculation. Judging from the circumstances, how can the so-called correction and rectification of the two ministries be said to be fair? The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry did not deeply investigate the real cause of this dispute and the motivation of the merchants and factories to refuse to join, and forcibly ordered them to join the United Association by February 1st, and threatened to revoke their registration and stop selling flower stamps and issuing licenses if they exceeded the deadline. It does not seem to be the ultimate intention of loving the manufacturers and treating them equally. We hereby declare that if the charter and agreement of the association can be legally corrected, the merchants and factories will get what they want and will naturally comply and join. Otherwise, their blood money is at stake, and the business is at stake. Rather than being forced to join and be slaughtered by others and cut off their own livelihood, it is better to make a final sacrifice and still have honor. At this time when the match industry is in unprecedented crisis, it is not enough to encourage it to survive. It is impossible to bear the association's request. If you do not investigate clearly and handle it according to the agreed method without any falsehood, the merchants and factories have limited financial resources and weak strength. They can only wait for the government's decision. We dare to ask the wise government authorities to correct it quickly and obtain a reasonable solution as soon as possible. The merchants uphold justice, shout loudly, and have no hesitation at the critical moment of life and death. It can be said that the reluctance of our people to be slaughtered and strive for survival is a problem for our merchants, and it can also be said to be a problem for the national industry. The merchants dare to say that justice is in the hearts of the people, and right and wrong will not be erased after all. The people of society and the public opinion circles of the people's mouthpiece will definitely give the merchants sympathy and assistance. This is just a declaration." (28th)</p>
<h3>Rice Prices in Guangdong Province Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>The reason is that domestic rice cannot be continuously supplied, and foreign rice is expensive and cannot be transported to Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: In recent days, although more than 3,000 bags of rice from Anhui have been transported to Guangdong, and the Civil Food Regulation Association has sold them to rice shops at fair prices to carry out price stabilization, each yuan can buy more than eight catties. However, the mere 3,000 bags have been sold out in less than three days. The price of rice has risen slightly and then increased. On the 28th, the price of ordinary white rice increased by several cents per yuan. According to general observations, the reason for the rice price increase is purely due to the shortage of rice sources. Rice from Anhui and Hunan cannot be continuously supplied. Although the tax on foreign rice has been reduced by half, merchants have not dared to purchase it. Because the rice in Vietnam and Siam is scarce due to crop failures in the producing areas and is sold to Europe in large quantities. After foreign rice arrives in Hong Kong, the price is not cheap. The price of high-quality foreign rice is about 11 yuan per picul, the price of medium-quality rice is about 10 yuan per picul, and the price of low-quality coarse rice is also about 9 yuan per picul. If it is transported from Hong Kong to Guangzhou, a customs duty of 3.8 yuan per picul is required (half price is 1.9 yuan). Even if medium-quality foreign rice is used as an example, the cost of transporting it to Guangdong, including customs duties and transportation costs, reaches more than 12 yuan per picul. Compared with the 12 yuan per picul for transporting Anhui rice to Guangdong, foreign rice is more expensive than Anhui rice. Therefore, although the government has reduced the tax on foreign rice by half, foreign rice still cannot be transported to Guangdong. Therefore, the rice shortage in Guangdong Province is becoming increasingly serious. The Guangzhou General Chamber of Commerce, seeing this, has once again telegraphed the central authorities, requesting that foreign rice be exempted from tax for six months. The reason is that from a practical point of view, purchasing foreign rice and allowing customs duties to be recorded at half price, limited to 300,000 metric tons, will still have little effect in relieving the current rice shortage in Guangdong Province. The way to cure the problem is to exempt foreign rice from tax for six months, so that universal relief can be provided and panic will not occur during the period of food scarcity. Although the central government will temporarily reduce tax revenue, it is enough to save the 30 million people of Guangdong Province from this disaster. The party and government also feel concerned about the food situation in Guangdong Province. The People's Food Relief Association, initiated and organized by the Provincial Party Department, was established on the 27th. It is divided into four groups: General Affairs, Investigation, Publicity, and Design. The tasks of each group are assigned to various organizations. As for the Civil Food Regulation Association, initiated and organized by the Department of Finance, has signed a contract with a banking group, and the banking group will release 4 million yuan in food mortgages, which are guaranteed by the Department of Finance, with weekly interest of six percent. The Civil Food Regulation Association is responsible for the profits and losses of rice procurement. After obtaining this loan, the Food Association has telegraphed Anhui Province to purchase a second batch of 40,000 bags of rice from Anhui, which will be transported to Guangdong by waterway for distribution to rice shops for price stabilization.

<h3>Songjiang Command Executes Traitors</h3>
<p>The Baoshan County Public Security Bureau arrested two suspects, Wang Si and Seng Chenghe, on August 4th of last year, and transferred them to the Third District Security Command for detailed interrogation. They confessed to being instructed by a certain party to probe military intelligence and highways and bridges, etc. Many evidences were found at Chenghe’s side. After admitting the accusations, the bureau proposed to sentence Wang Si to death for endangering the Republic of China, and Chenghe to 13 years in prison. The files were submitted to the superior authorities for approval. As a result, Wang Si was sent to Songjiang this morning by troops, and the death penalty was announced in the regular court. After tying up the criminal, he was paraded through the streets for a week, and then executed by firing squad at the Xiaojiao Field.</p>
<h3>Chongming Inspector Zhang Accused of Smoking Opium</h3>
<p>Zhang Jianbai, an inspector at the Third Precinct of the Fort Town Public Security Bureau in this county, was secretly reported to the provincial government and special commissioner's office for smoking opium and raping female workers in a cotton mill. The provincial government ordered the county government to send him to a drug rehabilitation hospital for examination regarding the smoking opium charge, and to send personnel to investigate the rape of women. After receiving the order, the county government ordered Inspector Zhang to go to the county and send him to the county hospital for examination.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Injury in Jiading's Yandunxia</h3>
<p>Xie Zhixiang, a Jiangbei native living outside the West Gate, made a living by selling fruits and general merchandise. He was diligent in his business and had a considerable surplus. On the morning of the 29th, he carried more than 300 yuan to Shanghai to add goods. When he went out, it was still dark. When he arrived at Yandunxia, south of Shagangmen, the east was slightly white. Three bandits knew that he was carrying a large amount of money and were waiting there. Seeing Xie, they stepped forward to stop him and stabbed Xie twice in the thighs, robbing him of everything he had and leaving. When it was dawn, passers-by saw Xie lying in a pool of blood and reported it to his family, who sent him to Renyi Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the injury is not serious and there is no danger.</p>

<h3>Favorable Small Victory for the Ideal Team in the Second Inter-Port Trial Match</h3>
<p>The Ideal Team's Momentum Was Strong in the First Half, Scoring Four to One; The Chinese Team Recovered Two Goals, Resulting in Four to Three</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese football team played the second inter-port trial match against the inter-port Ideal Team of Westerners. In the first half, Berlin Guy scored four goals alone, leading the Ideal Team with a score of four to one, and their momentum was very strong. In the second half, the Chinese team changed its lineup and recovered one goal, but was defeated with a score of four to three. In yesterday's game, both sides focused on individual skills, and the outcome was not considered important. The Chinese team was also selecting representatives to go to Hong Kong, so selection committees from both sides came to the venue to observe. At the start, the lineups of both sides were as follows:</p>
<p>Ideal Team Scored Four Consecutive Goals. The Ideal Team appeared with the most standard formation. The Chinese team responded with a pure, all-Tung Wah team. After the coin toss, the Chinese team attacked first, with Tuile advancing, but the shot hit the post. Sun Jinshun crossed, but Dai Linjing lost his footing. After a stalemate of nine minutes, the Ideal Team launched another attack. Li Ning made an accidental mistake, and Berlin Guy took the opportunity to break through, shooting from the penalty spot and scoring 1-0. The Ideal Team's offense was very strong, circling in Chinese territory for a long time. The Chinese team also had many good opportunities, but Wang Kehou made mistake after mistake, and Jia Youliang was repeatedly offside, missing opportunities. Zhang Rongcai performed best, saving dangerous shots many times, especially after colliding with Berlin Guy and falling to the ground, he immediately jumped up and kicked the ball out. The spinning ball went backwards, but fortunately Zhang's eyes were quick, and he turned around and caught it, which was greatly praised. The stalemate lasted until the 32nd minute, when Jim Watt passed the ball in, and Berlin Guy headed it in. Zhang Yue failed to catch it, and another goal was lost, making it 2-0. Minutes later, Jim Watt dribbled the ball and shot again. Zhang blocked it with both hands, and the ball bounced off the crossbar, but unexpectedly Berlin Guy took the opportunity to head it in, entering from Zhang's right side, losing three cities in a row. One minute later, Tuile sent the ball in from the baseline, with an excellent angle. Berlin Guy waited for the right moment, lowered his head and touched it, and it flew like an arrow, again brushing past Zhang's right side and entering the net, making it 4-0. After the center line kickoff, the Chinese team launched a major counterattack. Three minutes later, Feng Yunyou sent the ball forward from afar, Sun Jinshun passed it to the front of the goal, and Dai Linjing and Wang Kehou rushed up together and touched it, scoring one goal and bringing the score to 4-1. After that, Ma Shaner rushed to the front line to help the attack, and the Chinese team encountered dangerous situations again, but fortunately did not lose any more goals. The first half ended with a score of 4-1.</p>
<p>The Chinese Team Grabbed Back Two Goals. The Ideal Team only replaced Peir with Pan Jinsheng, and the rest remained unchanged. The Chinese team made many more changes. After the exchange of fire, the Ideal Team's two attacks failed. The Chinese team gradually became more active. Luo Douwen was slow to move forward, resulting in another missed opportunity. Sun Jinshun, Xu Buyun, and Dai Linjing also missed many shots. Then the Chinese team was again in a dangerous situation several times, but Zhang saved them one by one, especially catching Berlin Guy's fierce shot, which was his greatest contribution. The stalemate lasted for about half an hour, with no records and extremely boring. Thirty-one minutes into the poem, Jia dribbled the ball forward and sent it in. Dai Linjing blocked Ma Shaner, and Luo Douwen shot with his right foot, hitting the right corner of the net, bringing the score to 4-2. Three minutes later, Ma Shaner committed a handball in the penalty area. Sun Jinshun executed the penalty kick, bringing the score to 4-3. At this point, the numbers became closer, and the situation became more tense. The Chinese team's offense was still very close, but they missed the opportunity. In the last few minutes, the Ideal Team's offense became even fiercer. Jim shot from afar, and it was extremely sharp. Zhang again caught it high with both hands, which was really not easy. Unexpectedly, Ma committed another handball, but fortunately it was outside the penalty area. Liu Shizan took the free kick, but it was caught by Bao Saizhong. Finally, Xu Jingcheng shot fiercely, over the crossbar. When the whistle blew, the Chinese team lost badly with a score of 4-3 due to too many losses in the first half.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Library's Fifth Anniversary of Reorganization</h3>
<p>Adding 100,000 Volumes in Five Years; Over 800,000 Readers and Borrowers</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Library has been established for 34 years and has a collection of over 300,000 volumes, making it a major provincial library in the country. Since it was ordered to reorganize in January 21, and Chen Xunzi took over as the current director, it has been five years, and he has worked hard on library affairs, and the promotion of all aspects has been quite effective. It is learned that the library held a commemorative meeting on the 25th, and a get-together was held in the evening. Chen gave a detailed report on the library's progress in the past five years. Because the library's career is closely related to the progress of academic education in Zhejiang Province, the reporter specially learned the following statistics on the library's collection and reading in the past five years: In the past five years, the Zhejiang Library has added a total of 67,919 books, including 43,820 purchased volumes and 24,099 donated volumes. In addition, there are 44,000 volumes of Wang's books that were previously collected and newly registered, totaling 110,000 volumes, an average annual increase of 12,000 volumes. To date, the Zhejiang Library has about 60,000 volumes of Siku Quanshu and rare books, about 10,000 volumes of foreign language documents, about 280,000 volumes of Chinese books, and 8,000 bound volumes of magazines and newspapers, making it the library with the most books among the provincial libraries in the country. As for reading and borrowing books, the library added new characters in the autumn of the 21st year, and the original two library sites were used as branch libraries. After September of the 23rd year, a daily opening method was implemented, that is, the weekly holiday on Monday was cancelled, and it was open for borrowing and reading every day of the year from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm, which was convenient for readers. The borrowing of books used credit guarantee procedures, which was extremely convenient. In the last year, methods such as delivering borrowed books to the city and communicating with the province were implemented, which further promoted it. As a result, the number of people has increased year by year. It is estimated that in about five years from February of the 21st year to the end of December of last year, a total of 802,087 people read and borrowed books (excluding daily newspapers), including 240,000 people in the 24th year, which is four times the 60,000 people in the 21st year. The number of books read and borrowed reached 2,093,198 volumes, with an average of 649 volumes read by readers per day in five years, which shows the popularity of reading and borrowing. As for the compilation of catalogs, the "Wenlan Journal" quarterly and the Library Outlook monthly were compiled and published. The organization and storage of increased copies of plates, the holding of exhibitions and academic lectures, the guidance of the province's library undertakings, and the improvement of the printing work have had many auxiliary effects on education and academics. The Zhejiang Literature Exhibition, which was organized by the hall in November of last year, was a major cultural and educational event, and many places followed suit. It is said that the library feels that the book storage and reading room are insufficient due to the increase in books and reading, and is planning to increase the construction of the library. The Zhejiang Provincial Government and the educational administrative authorities, in view of the fact that there is only one provincial library in the province (Jiangsu has three), also intend to help the library develop for the purpose of promoting the province's academic culture.</p>

<p>Students Seek Members</p>

Those in Shanghai account for a large part, so there is a student association in Shanghai. However, due to the fact that the number of members has not been universal, the sense of unity and mutual assistance is lacking. Therefore, the association decided at a meeting held at the Dinghai Fellow Association on January 19 to expand its recruitment from February 1, and elected Yuan Yang'an, Qiu Guozhen, Fan Caicong, Zhou Shuwu, Dong Hongjun, Liang Fengxiang, Hu Shigui and other seven people as directors.

<h3>Several Issues Concerning English Teaching in Secondary Education (4)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shijie</p>
<p>To make teaching practical, to passively reduce employment difficulties, and to actively increase employment opportunities, based on the current situation, only those who cannot advance to higher education should enter society and start working. Before graduation, neither the students themselves nor their parents often give sufficient consideration to what kind of work they should do. Furthermore, those running schools often do not pay sufficient attention to providing them with guidance. Whether to pursue further education or to enter the workforce is left to chance. This represents an enormous and obvious loss to the nation, society, families, and individuals. After graduating from secondary school, some students should go on to higher education, while others should enter the workforce. Which types of students should pursue higher education, and which should enter the workforce? This is an important issue concerning national policy, social needs, and the personal futures of students. While it is practically impossible for a nation to provide higher education opportunities for everyone, it is also questionable in terms of students' innate talents, academic abilities, and personalities. Students' innate talents, academic abilities, and personalities are factual issues and should be considered as prerequisites for either pursuing further education or entering the workforce. Many students may not possess the innate talents and academic abilities to enter university, but that does not mean they cannot do beneficial work, or even do better than students who have attended university. Those running educational institutions and responsible for guiding students should understand each student's innate talents, academic abilities, and personality. Only those suitable for higher education should be encouraged to pursue it. Those who are not suitable for higher education should be informed of this fact early on and advised to prepare for employment after graduation. We should never assume that everyone should or can pursue higher education. Such an assumption is unfounded and dangerous. Furthermore, we should clearly inform those unsuitable for higher education, before they graduate or choose a school, about the appropriate schools they should attend. We should also provide them with a planned, step-by-step, and practical preparation for employment, tailored to their individual innate talents, academic abilities, and personalities. Currently, the government is making great efforts to reduce the number of general secondary schools and increase the number of vocational and normal schools. This is just one remedial measure. A fundamental reform requires every secondary school to pay close attention to this issue. This is essential in vocational schools and should also receive considerable attention in general secondary schools. Some young people tend to aim too high when choosing a career, and this should be avoided. Only by choosing a career that suits one's own innate talents, academic abilities, and personality, and that meets the needs of the nation and society, can both the individual and the nation benefit. China is currently in an extraordinary situation. In all fields, such as military affairs, politics, finance, construction, domestic and foreign affairs, education, industry, medicine, and public health, there is an urgent need for leaders and talent. However, we must not forget that in all these fields, we also need middle and lower-level cadres and talent. Currently, in all industries, not only is there a lack of high-level command personnel, but there is also a felt void in middle and lower-level cadres and talent. This is a very noteworthy matter. Without a sufficient number and quality of middle and lower-level cadres and talent, these undertakings cannot be done well. The importance of this aspect is perhaps overlooked by many. These middle and lower-level cadres and talent are an important foundation for supporting all industries. They also require considerable talent and training. Some of them come from universities and specialized schools, while others come from secondary schools. Many of them are specialized and technical personnel, and the rest must bear varying degrees of responsibility for the matters under their jurisdiction. Their ability to work largely depends on the technical and moral training they receive in school. China's secondary education should truly pay attention to adapting to this urgent need of the nation and provide a sufficient number of qualified personnel for various industries' middle and lower-level cadres.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>February Yarn Unusually High</p>
<p>Indian Merchants Continue to Buy and Hold / Market Speculators Scramble to Cover Positions / Gap Between Near and Far Contracts Widens</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be firm, with the February contract particularly strong. Indian merchants are buying up large quantities and refusing to release them, leading to market rumors of a possible squeeze. Speculators, wary of the unfavorable environment, are rushing to cover their positions, driving prices higher. Only a few are scouring for spot yarn to deliver. No major fluctuations are expected during this settlement period, but future changes are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Deferred Yarn Seeing Sell-offs / The opening price of the spot yarn market jumped two yuan for February delivery. Due to aggressive buying by Indian merchants, large quantities were absorbed, drying up the market. However, deferred contracts saw some sell-offs, widening the gap between near and far contracts. Spot yarn sales are brisk, and prices are rising. Osaka Three Spades yarn also rose by two, three, and four yuan. The results of spot yarn trading showed February up 1.8 yuan from the previous day's closing price, with other contracts up or down by 0.2 to 0.4 yuan. In the afternoon opening, market conditions remained stable, with retail investors covering short positions. Prices rose slowly.

Yesterday, Japanese merchants, concerned about the severity of the U.S. cotton disaster, sold off large quantities of April futures cotton. Today, they seem to be stuck.</p>
<p>Futures Cotton Showing Slight Increase / The opening price of the spot cotton market showed a slight increase in various months, but the momentum remained weak and listless. U.S. and Indian cotton prices retreated again, dampening sentiment. However, spot cotton demand from factories is relatively strong, while a batch of speculative holdings at the exchange is unwelcome, putting downward pressure.

<p>Recent Trading in American Cotton More Active</p>
<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton showed a sluggish and dull market. Prices fell by 5 to 8 points across various months due to poor Liverpool telegraph, easing of flood conditions, and profit-taking by domestic and international longs. Traders then bought near-month contracts, and Liverpool groups bought May contracts. The Pacific coastal area of Changlong Gong has been resolved. At the same time, there is hope for an early resolution of the automobile strike. Market conditions improved slightly. Market sentiment was mixed. The May contract faced resistance around 11.6 cents, and new buying from outside the industry decreased. In terms of spot goods, demand exceeded supply for superior-grade cotton. Before closing, traders bought near-month contracts, and prices rose again. Spot prices fell 2 points, while futures prices remained unchanged to down 9 points. British cotton spot prices fell 4 points, and futures prices fell 1 point. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying by European exporters, but then retreated due to profit-taking by longs, farmer selling, and poor Liverpool news. Pingguoer fell 1.15 to 1.5 rupees, Robium hot fell 0.75 rupees, and Robi white creek fell 1.5 rupees. (Telegraphed on the 29th)</p>

The pre-exchange price of Beihai pianqing the day before yesterday was 10 yuan and 0.05 jiao, due to the sudden decrease. Yesterday it had tightened again to 11 yuan, but it was not completed. According to the Shantou telegram, the Chao sugar rose another 0.2 yuan yesterday, but the household was still lacking.</p>

<p>Yellow Beans Rose Again Following the Price of the Continuously High City</p>
<p>Foreign Firms Stabilize Sesame Seeds</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow bean market was quite active under the rising price of Dalian's city, and the appearance of car beans was average. However, the medium quality bean products had increased by 45 points, and the small seed of the Dalian Siping Street's storage beans had opened up to 6 yuan and 1 jiao 1, and the big seed was 6 yuan and 1 jiao 7, which was up to 67 points different from the market price of the previous two days. Yesterday, a total of more than 4,000 bags of beans were opened up for the city. Yihe Foreign Firms went to the Foreign Firms of Sesame seeds from foreign countries to handle 200 tons, and the price was 14 yuan and 8 jiao. The general trend has stabilized, and if there is no large group to handle, it can safely pass the year's customs during the waste calendar.</p>
<p>The Price of Rice in the Lower River Was Too High and Returned Slightly Yesterday</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, a total of 60 numbers arrived from various sources, totaling 112,000 stones. Among them, the thin rice number 112, and the sales market in this street turned dull. The appetite of the baozi market also looked forward to the continuous rise in prices, and only Qingdao Gang handled more than 1,000 bags of thin rice, which caused the situation to suddenly fall, and the result was that except for the high-quality goods, the market price of the thin rice fell a little by a corner, and the medium-sized rice even fell by 0.3 yuan. The soft, sharp, and shady rice of Du Yang settled by yuan.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the source of the river roads was thirty-one two numbers, and the various sales roads in the city were still light. The price of white rice in the city was also slightly reduced to 0.1 yuan. The price of the yangdu bujian xian rice was soft, and the price of white yuan was tired. The appetite for early thin rice was quite active, and the price was tight. The price of other goods did not rise or fall.</p>
<p>The Freight Owners All Wish to Sell Spot Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the Ke Xian market saw a slight decrease in the arrival of goods, the floating inventory in the city was very abundant. A part of the pedestrian guests still mainly settled early, and the river rice cut back, and the heart was quite soft. Therefore, although there was activity from the North and South gangs, the market was still flat. Guangdong's appetite was still good all day, but this year's ship position was insufficient, only 45,000 bags of machine brown rice were handled. It is said that there are still 34 ships to be installed this year, and although the installation of goods seems to be more, Shantou Xiamen is slightly embellished, but the North Ocean gang has not been smoothly handled for a long time, and 34,000 machine red rice and so on were handled yesterday. Therefore, there is still a part of the people in the city hoping for good. All day, 5,120 bags of Jiangxi rice were opened, 450 bags of Shashi Hunan machine red rice, and 1,000 bags of Jiaxing crude silver tip.</p>
<p>The Spot Powder Delivery Only Has Jing Tong Goods Coming</p>
<p>Yesterday was the delivery of a day's worth of flour, and the quantity was not smooth, because the goods from each factory in this port were drawn and loaded by the customer gangs one after another beforehand, so there was no delivery, only Nanjing Dafactory delivered 7,000 bags of green rabbits. Nantong Fuxin Factory handed over Xu Danwanbao's most important system of temporary purchase and hired workers to turn around in Longhai Road, in order to make the market cheap and easy to promote.</p>
<p>Half of the Spot Wheat Delivered Is Loaded to Tianjin</p>
<p>The delivery of wheat has been soothed and neat, and the total number is one hundred and nineteen cars. Half of them have been transferred to Tianjin, and the rest are still sold to Shen Factory. As for the current wheat market, the factory stomach is slightly better, and the prices of each file are slightly better by a few points. Jiangbei wheat opened 6 yuan and 1 and a half jiao, and the wheat along the Jinpu Road opened 6 yuan 2 and 7 jiao, seeing a delivery of more than 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>Also, the Cereals Exchange issued a notice that "The date of this year's Spring Festival holiday, photographed until February 5, the market will be closed from the 6th to the 14th, and the normal hearing and photographing will be held on the morning of Monday the 15th."</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>The Price Difference between Domestic and Foreign White Factories Is Still Far Away</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets in Japan and the United States saw slight gains. Yokohama spot goods re-emerged at 900 yuan, closing at 903 yuan, up 10 yuan from the previous day. Futures were up 4 yuan and remained stable. New York spot was up 1 cent, and futures were up 1 and a half cents. Other Japanese silk and Shanghai silk each rose 2 cents, Guangdong silk rose 3 cents, and the Lyon silk market was stable and did not change much. Yesterday, the Shanghai silk market saw a slight sale from foreign firms. B-grade was priced at 775 yuan for 78 points, down 5 yuan from the previous day. Gray silk sign grade was priced at 410 yuan, up 15 yuan from the previous day. The price held by the local manufacturers was B font 13.15 which was 830 yuan, 20.22 which was 770 yuan, the former price that Western merchants eat was 800 yuan, and the latter price was only 740 yuan, the distance was still about 30 yuan. So there were only a small number of transactions, totaling 121 bales.</p>
<p>Japanese Tea Exports to the Soviet Union Increase Sharply</p>
<p>The Soviet Union has always been a large consumer of tea. In previous years, Chinese tea was sold to Russia, averaging around 300,000 boxes each year. Recently, there has been a sharp decline, falling to 130,000 boxes. The sales of Chinese tea have been severely hit. Although Russia has promoted tea production, the large-scale competition from Japanese tea is also a major cause of the injury. According to general informed sources, since the transfer of the China Eastern Railway, Japanese green tea has been sold to Russia every year, with more than 200,000 boxes, most of which have been compensated by road credits. From the current situation, if Chinese people do not seek to improve and strive to expand Sino-Russian trade, but continue to let nature take its course, it will be difficult to restore the sales of Chinese tea in Russia.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Large Tinplate Prices Increase More Than Ten Yuan</p>
<p>Since yarn factories, toy factories, military factories, and others purchased, the standard in the market has been exhausted and the standard has risen sharply due to lack of goods, such as the twenty-fourth number is estimated at one hundred yuan per box, and the twenty-sixth number is estimated at one hundred and thirty yuan, which are all better than the previous ten yuan. It is found that as many as four or fifty boxes were opened yesterday, but overseas prices have soared, so the market in this port may be difficult to return to loose.</p>
<p>Hard Lead Wire Stock is Exhausted</p>
<p>Due to the fact that hard lead wire has not arrived from overseas for a long time, the flow of goods in this port is also exhausted, and the market has risen as a result. The coarse color is estimated at sixteen or seventeen yuan, and the fine color is estimated at fourteen or five yuan. I heard that spring factories and Ningbo gangs need to be used, and there is no general purchase.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods</h3>
<p>Almonds: Tianjin Inventory Scarce</p>
<p>According to Tianjin sources, almond inventory is very low, especially high-quality goods, with only over a hundred packages in total. The highest-quality North Mountain almonds are priced at one hundred yuan, the next at ninety-one yuan, Central Village at sixty-seven yuan and fifty cents, bitter almonds at twelve yuan and eight cents, and the next at twenty-one yuan and three cents.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News</h3>
<p>Endless Stream of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Chinese People Love to Eat Japanese Sugar</p>
<p>Imports of Japanese goods are exceptionally brisk, with sugar being the most prominent. Last week, the Jia Yi Liu (甲二六) Maru and Mikasa Maru (三笠丸) ships transported over ten thousand eight hundred packages, as reported previously.

<p>Shen Bao Children's Supplement</p>
<h3>Forge Iron-Like Physique to Avenge Our Humiliation!</h3>
<p>— Yan Maode</p>
<p>Children, health is the fountain of life. Locke once said: "A great undertaking resides in a healthy physique." This shows the importance of health. With a healthy physique, we can have an indomitable spirit. With an indomitable spirit, we can shoulder significant responsibilities.</p>
<p>In Hamburg, Germany, every time it snows in winter, a group of children, wearing only single layers of clothing and bare arms, exercise their bodies in the freezing snow. Someone asked them why they weren't afraid of the cold. They said, "We want to forge iron-like bodies so we can avenge France!" Children, they are preparing like this from a young age. Their national patriotic spirit is truly something we admire and are ashamed of.</p>
<p>Children! You must know that modern warfare is a bitter and difficult national war. Everything relies on a strong body, able to endure arduous struggles, before one can go to battle. However, our old and large China, despite having thousands of years of culture, has a national physique weakened to the extreme. That is why Westerners call us the "Sick Man of East Asia."</p>
<p>Children! You are all the masters of the future, bearing great responsibilities. To avenge the nation's humiliation and build a new China, a strong physique is essential. Strengthening the nation requires strengthening the race, and strengthening the race must start from childhood. From now on, forge an iron-like physique to avenge our humiliation! Children! Remember these words.</p>
<h3>The Four Martyrs</h3>
<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Children! Who are the Four Martyrs? They are four brave warriors from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Boy Scout Corps: Luo Yunxiang, Mao Zhengxiang, Bao Zhengwu, and Ying Wenda. On the eve of the "January 28th" War, their most important rescue work was immediately established, and each of them swore an oath: "To be loyal to the country, rescue those in distress, and disregard all sacrifices." Under the command of the团长 (regiment leader, this might be a mistranslation, but I don't know if that is the case) they all set off, team after team, holding high the flags of the Red Cross, to carry out rescue work in the Zhabei war zone. On the morning of the 31st, these four brave warriors were, of course, sent out to work, but they did not return until evening. They were killed inexplicably! And their remains are still unknown. Later, in order to commemorate these four boy scouts, we had to create a cenotaph for the Four Martyrs.</p>
<p>What day is today? It is the day that Luo Yunxiang, Mao Zhengxiang, Bao Zhengwu, and Ying Wenda, four loyal and brave Chinese boy scouts, sacrificed their lives for the sake of their country! Children, aren't we all boy scouts? So, after seeing the Four Martyrs, what do you express? What are your feelings? Do you have the courage of the Four Martyrs? In times of extreme crisis, would you be willing to sacrifice everything and do rescue work on the battlefield? Children! We should know that we are not afraid of death(?). As long as it is for the nation to fight for survival and for the country to seek independence, we are willing to sacrifice everything. At the same time, the death of the Four Martyrs is very glorious, because they died for the sake of their country! Therefore, their heroic deeds can shake the entire China, the entire world, especially our boy scouts. Their heroic names will be immortal. But the Four Martyrs are dead. How will we comfort them in the afterlife?</p>
<h3>Animals' Protection Against Cold</h3>
<p>— Cao Yixuan</p>
<p>When the weather turns cold, everyone prepares clothes to protect against the cold. However, animals have already naturally prepared for this early on. For example, animal fur falls out when spring warms up, and sparse summer fur grows instead. When the cold wind chills to the bone at the turn of autumn and winter, they grow a new layer of soft, dense winter fur, and the color of the fur is different in winter and summer. This serves to protect against the cold and against external harm. Some animals also store more fat in their bodies in winter to nourish themselves when food is scarce, or they store fat under their skin to prevent heat from dissipating. For example: ㊀ Deer spots disappear in winter. In the summer, they have beautiful spots all over their bodies. As autumn cools down in September, they gradually change. By mid-October, they completely change to winter fur, and all the white spots disappear, turning into a mixed brown color. The female deer also grow hair around their heads, and their soft antlers also become hard antlers. So when there are spots, the antlers are soft, and when the spots disappear, the antlers become hard. ㊁ Wild boars turn gray in August and gradually grow winter fur, turning brown. At the same time, they grow long hair from their heads to their backs. ㊂ When giraffes grow summer fur, they regrow a layer of winter fur in winter. Although the fur color does not change, the summer fur becomes thicker and denser. ㊃ Wild rabbits have yellow and black mottled fur in the summer, but in autumn and winter, the fur on their waist and abdomen turns white, gradually changing to the tips of their ears, and the rest of their body is white. ㊄ Arctic foxes are yellowish-brown in the summer and pure white in the winter. Because the weather in the Arctic is cold and the ground is covered in ice and snow, they turn white for protection. ㊅ When it gets cold in the Arctic, bears grow long hair around their necks, encircling their necks. ㊅ Since the beginning of winter, the fur of camels gradually lengthens, and by the time spring warms up, the fur gradually falls off, looking like they are naked. The above is the natural physiological state of mammals' protection against cold. The same is true for birds. For example, male mandarin ducks grow full feathers on their backs, and these feathers fall off in the summer. Females are the same, but the color of the bill is yellow for females and red for males. This is the difference between males and females. Next are ptarmigans. These birds live in high mountains and are yellow in the summer and pure white with thick feathers in the winter. However, male birds have red feathers above their eyes that are the same as their summer fur, and the outside of their tails is black. There is also a kind of plover whose black-brown spots on their heads turn completely white in winter. So if we don't understand the reason for the change in birds' feathers, we will be suspicious. In fact, the change in the feathers of any bird or animal depends on the cold and heat. It's like we wear silk shirts in the summer, which is one way of dressing, and in the winter, we change to fur coats and woolen robes and coats. That's another way of dressing.</p>
<h3>Cuttlefish</h3>
<p>— Zhong Mei</p>
<p>Xiao Min's mother bought a few cuttlefish from the market, and she prepared to make a delicious dish for Xiao Min. During lunch, Xiao Min ate the cuttlefish, but he didn't know what he was eating because it was the first time he had tasted this delicious dish. So, during the meal, he asked his mother, "What is this? It's so delicious!"</p>
<p>His mother replied, "It's cuttlefish, also called inkfish."</p>
<p>"Then what do they look like? I've never seen one before. Can you tell me roughly?"</p>
<p>"Their bodies are very soft, and they have two distinct parts: the head and the torso. Head: They have big eyes on both sides of their head. Yes, there is a mouth on top of their head? Inside the mouth is a horny tooth tongue, and around the mouth are ten fleshy feet. When they crawl, they use the many suckers on the inside of their feet. When they catch food, they use the two longest ones. Torso: Outside the torso, there is a sac-like mantle. It secretes a piece of oval-shaped bone called cuttlebone, which can quickly stop bleeding when we are cut by a knife. When they swim, they rely on the fleshy feet on their heads and the inner fins on both sides of their torso."</p>
<p>"If they encounter animals that are bigger than them, what do they use to resist?"</p>
<p>"If they are attacked, they have two methods: ㊀ Under their ventral side, there is an ink sac, which contains a lot of ink. When attacked, they release the ink, so the seawater becomes turbid, the attacking animal can't see their movements, and they escape quickly. ㊁ There are pigment cells on the outside of their mantle. After encountering an enemy, they can immediately change the color of the outside of their body to another color and take the opportunity to swim to another place to hide."</p>
<p>"Besides eating them and the use of cuttlebone, what are they used for?"</p>
<p>"After their meat is dried, it is called cuttlefish jerky, and the black juice in the ink sac can also be made into pigment. Their shells can be used for medicinal purposes."</p>
<h3>Future Chinese Children</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>"Future Chinese children," which path should they also take? This is a topic to be discussed today.</p>
<p>I believe that "future Chinese children" should identify the following goals, bravely move forward, and advance courageously. Only in this way can they be new Chinese children, Chinese children who are living in extraordinary times.</p>
<p>㊀ Strive for physical health: — Europeans and Americans often mock us, saying, "Chinese people are sick men of East Asia, and Chinese children are sick children of East Asia!" These two sentences truly have a full meaning of insult. In this extraordinary period, under the serious situation of national crisis, adults should of course actively engage in physical training, but children should especially strive for physical health. It must be known that only with a healthy spirit can we do great undertakings; only with a healthy body can we engage in the work of national rejuvenation. Children are the roots and seedlings of the country, the pillars of the nation. This point must not be overlooked!</p>
<p>㊁ Strive for scientific research: — Everyone knows that the present is a scientific world, a scientific era. The strength of European and American countries and the development of all undertakings are completely built on the foundation of "science." Now we want national rejuvenation, national strength, and washing away national humiliation. We must put in some effort in scientific research. I hope that children will not regard science as a daunting task, thinking that studying science is a boring thing. It must be known that all interest comes from science. As long as you study diligently, interest will naturally follow.</p>
<p>㊁ Pay attention to the cultivation of morality: — Future Chinese children must not only have healthy bodies and scientific minds, but also have good morals. In the negative aspect, they should have neat and clean habits; in the positive aspect, they should especially have the spirit of courage and struggle. Only by advancing in both directions can good morals be cultivated.</p>
<p>I believe that the above three goals are the path that "future Chinese children" should take. I hope, dear children, that from today, the first day of the Republic of China's twenty-sixth year, you will strive to implement them!</p>
<p>Physics Little Knowledge</p>
<h3>Why is water transparent? Why is snow opaque?</h3>
<p>— He Zixiang</p>
<p>Children! It's winter, and the mercury in the thermometer has dropped below zero. We are wearing cotton clothes and绒衣 (a type of woolen underwear) and still feel cold, so we have to warm ourselves around the stove.</p>
<p>The flowing river water has already frozen; the turbid world has been covered with a layer of clean and bright white snow.</p>
<p>Children, we know that rain is water that has been heated, vaporized, and risen, and then encountered cold air in the sky, condensing into droplets. When several small droplets gather, they become a larger droplet, which falls to the ground as rain.</p>
<p>Snow: Children, do you know how it is formed?</p>
<p>Water droplets that remain in the air encounter the attack of colder weather, and they condense into hail or water; hail or water, when they encounter even colder weather, are dissected into flakes of snow.</p>
<p>Children: Do you like to play with water? Do you love to tread in the snow? Water is transparent, and snow is opaque. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>Snow is a fragment of water, as mentioned above. Comparing the surface of snow with the surface of water, snow is larger. Therefore, the light reflected by the surface is also more; and the gaps between the snowflakes retain air. The light that penetrates is partially transmitted and then undergoes total reflection in the air. Therefore, it will not be transparent and appears white.</p>
<h3>Conduction</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder day by day. A thick layer of ice has formed in the house, not to mention the cold outside. Min'er's house seems particularly cold because it is close to the wilderness, with vast land and few people.</p>
<p>Min'er is a child who likes cleanliness very much. When he gets up every morning, washing his face and rinsing his mouth are of course essential, but he also has a very good habit! He must first examine his hair and nails. One day, his nails grew long, so he went to get a pair of scissors to trim them. When he picked up the scissors, he felt that they were particularly cold today, chilling to the bone. And he remembered very clearly that last summer, he felt that they were very warm. This made him puzzled. So he went to consult his problem solver — his brother Cong'er — and asked him to answer this question.</p>
<p>"Brother, this is a very good question. You need to know that scissors are metal, and metal is a good conductor. What is a good conductor? A good conductor is something that, when one end is burned, the heat from the burning end can be transmitted to the entire object. In winter, the outside air is definitely much colder than your body temperature. If your hand touches the metal, the metal will quickly transfer the heat from your hand to the cold air, so your hand feels cold. You should also know that hot air mixes easily with cold air because hot air is lighter than cold air. But in summer, the temperature of the air is higher than the temperature of your body, and the metal can quickly transfer the heat of the air to your hand, so your hand feels hot."</p>
<p>"Brother, how do you know that metal is a good conductor of heat? Are there any other things that are poor conductors of heat?"</p>
<p>"I used to have the same question and asked our teacher, so he showed us an experiment: He took a four-inch-long iron rod and put one end on a lamp to burn for a few minutes, and the end of the rod that he was holding gradually got hot, which shows that heat is transferred from one end to the other end. Anything that has this situation is a good conductor. Glass, air, etc. are poor conductors, but these good conductors and poor conductors are compared to each other."</p>
<h3>Please Continue Your Efforts to Support the Suiyuan Region During the Winter Vacation</h3>
<p>— Wei Ji</p>
<p>Children! The annual winter vacation has arrived, and everyone will have another happy winter vacation at home!</p>
<p>However, with the country facing hardship and the insurgents disturbing the Suiyuan border, every Chinese citizen should contribute to supporting Suiyuan. Those with money should donate money, and those with strength should contribute their strength. Everyone should be of one mind and constantly engage in supporting Suiyuan! We children are of course all citizens, so why don't we take advantage of the vacation to work hard to support Suiyuan and save the country?</p>
<p>Although the support work you children have done in the past has been very enthusiastic: some have been frugal with their clothing and food, some have saved pocket money, some have raised clothes and donated money, and some even have poor children reducing their food and saving money. These many different ways of supporting Suiyuan have given the country a lot of help and are of course worthy of everyone's praise! But we should know that if the unrest on the Suiyuan border does not stop for a day, our support work cannot stop for a day! Moreover, in the past, everyone was limited by time because they were studying at school and could not work very hard. Now that the winter vacation has arrived, our support work must continue to be strengthened and expanded!</p>
<p>Children! I sincerely hope that you will continue to work hard to support Suiyuan! Expand your work! And only stop when the insurgents are completely eliminated! Now we have a very long vacation to use, which is a great opportunity for everyone to work hard to support Suiyuan. I hope you don't just be lazy and miss it!</p>

<h3>Toy Lending Places to Make Children Happy</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>To give every girl a doll, and every boy a toy, just like borrowing books from a public library. This is an initiative of the Los Angeles Regional Association two years ago to make boys and girls happy. The leaders of the association, because of the economic downturn in the market in recent years, many children do not even have enough food and clothing, let alone toys. But toys are as precious as food and clothing in the eyes of children. Therefore, they came up with a relief plan and organized a toy lending place in cooperation with educational groups, civil organizations, and sympathetic people, imitating the public library's method of borrowing books with cards. Every registered applicant can borrow a doll for two weeks. The loan can be renewed when it expires, but unlike the library, if it is not returned when it expires, or it is returned damaged, a fine must be paid, because this kind of punishment is not suitable for children. There is also a preferential measure: every girl can choose one favorite doll from dozens of dolls. After "raising" her for two weeks, she must send it back to the lending place for inspection. If it is proved that she is a "good mother", she can keep her for another two weeks. After the expiration date, send it back for inspection again. If she is still tidy, she can "raise" her for another six weeks. After six weeks, if the inspection proves that she is indeed a "good mother," she can keep the doll forever as her own. This method can encourage and cultivate children's habit of cherishing things.</p>
<p>Where do the required dolls come from? They are all donated by wealthy families. Movie star Ms. Hill donated more than 200 dolls from her doll room to the lending place alone. The doll that a girl keeps permanently is considered her adopted child, and a certificate must be filled out and sent to the donor. Because this method is very interesting, everyone is happy to donate when donating dolls, and more than 1,000 were received at once.</p>
<p>If the lending place rents another house, the cost will be too high. So they negotiated with public schools and libraries to borrow their extra rooms to set up sub-lending places. Each sub-lending place must first pay 60 yuan to the headquarters of the lending place, or pay 5 yuan per month, because each doll must be disinfected and sorted before it is lent out. This fee is used to pay workers' salaries. The insufficient funds are borne by the local association. As for the staff who manage the lending affairs, some are volunteers and some are given a small transportation fee. Now a house 100 feet wide and 120 feet long has been rented as the main workshop, with 40 workers inside. Every two weeks, the returned dolls are painted and sorted once. They are very busy.</p>
<p>Since this matter was established, the results have been very good. Therefore, people are imitating it everywhere, and the scale has been expanded a lot compared to the initial establishment. The funding is also very sufficient, and the National Youth Affairs Office and the local municipal government are helping to carry out everything.</p>
<p>What is said above is the method of making female children happy. As for male children, dolls are not suitable, so many boys' toys, such as small bicycles and ice skates, have been raised separately. It is also based on the method of lending dolls, and if there is no damage after six weeks, it belongs to the borrower. There are now 3,000 registration cards for the Los Angeles lending place. Last year, there were a total of 41,000 loans. From February to the end of June, the age of the borrowers in five months was mostly between 4 and 10 years old, according to the charter, from 2 years old to 17 years old. The area of Los Angeles is 4.5 million miles, and there are now 6 sub-lending places.</p>
<p>We children from poor families probably also hope that there will be such a lending place in our local area. The reporter is very willing for enthusiastic people who care about children's entertainment to initiate this initiative.</p>
<h3>Righteousness (Two)</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Just as a large wave had passed, another one followed, pushing the sailing boat forward, bringing it even closer to the small reef. The captain, Begg, seeing that there was little hope, issued an order, telling the sailors to abandon ship and try to reach the small reef. To his surprise, the sailors refused to obey, shouting in unison that they would not leave the broken ship unless the captain led the way to safety. The captain calmly repeated his order, telling them that his own life was of least importance and would be the last to be considered. Seeing the captain's firm attitude, the sailors had to obey his command, leaving the broken ship in an orderly manner, as if the ship were entering the harbor and everyone was disembarking safely. However, they were all numb with cold, and many could not climb onto the reef, being swept away by the waves. Sadly, the first mate also perished in this way. Captain Begg, seeing that everyone had left, was the last to leave the broken ship. He saw that the shore was not far away, but the tide was rising, and he predicted that soon the reef they were standing on would be submerged. However, there were no signs of people on this coast, and the fog was very thick. It seemed that the whole group would be swallowed by the high tide, with no hope of rescue.</p>
<p>That courageous crew member still silently and tightly held onto the rope, determined to rescue his comrades. He earnestly prayed, tied the rope around his waist, and struggled through the raging tide, finally reaching the shore. He immediately turned back and loudly informed his comrades that he had safely landed.</p>
<p>Now, a rope stretched between the shore and the reef, its length just right for two people to hold on to from each side. Their only hope was to cling to the rope and risk climbing ashore. The rising tide had already reached the hands of the sailors crouching on the reef, but no one rushed to go first. Captain Begg still called out their names one by one, asking them to climb the rope in order. They still pleaded with the captain to go first, but the captain firmly replied, "I will not leave this reef until everyone has safely reached the shore."</p>

<h3>Hong Kong-Shanghai Wireless Telephone Successfully Tested Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Newspaper Sends Congratulations and Wishes of Health to Colleagues in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-Shanghai wireless telephone service is scheduled to officially open at 7:00 AM on the first of next month. Mayor Wu and the Governor of Hong Kong will exchange congratulatory messages, and the press will be invited for free. However, a trial call was held between Hong Kong and Shanghai on the 30th. Zhang Zhting, editor-in-chief of the Hong Kong Overseas Chinese Daily, wanting accurate details of the test call, had the newspaper's Shanghai correspondent conduct the first test call from Hong Kong to the Chinese area of ​​this city at 4:50 PM on the 30th. The sound was very clear, no different from the sound of an automatic telephone in this city. It is believed that the official call will be a great success. In addition to exchanging greetings with the reporter, Zhang also instructed him to extend wishes of health to colleagues in this city and to unite as a nation to save the country through public opinion. A news item from Hong Kong was also relayed, which is recorded below. The Hong Kong Changmen Reservoir, which has been under construction for a long time, was officially opened at 3:00 PM on the 30th. The Governor of Hong Kong personally attended the ceremony. The Guangdong Provincial Government, the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, and the provincial and municipal party departments all sent representatives to Hong Kong to participate. The ceremony was very grand. The reservoir is the most significant project in Hong Kong. Before its completion, the water levels of various reservoirs in Hong Kong would be affected during the hot summer months if rainfall decreased, making it impossible to supply the entire Hong Kong population. Therefore, the opening hours of tap water were controlled, and street-side water pipes were also restricted, but the opening hours were slightly longer to accommodate residents. Under the sweltering heat, the demand for water for cooking and bathing would inevitably increase, causing concerns about water shortages. As a result, many residents would fetch water from public water pipes on the streets, often resulting in fights in the rush. After the completion of the reservoir, which has a storage capacity of 300 million gallons, water shortages will no longer occur during the opening, and the suffering of residents due to water shortages will be reduced. The people of Hong Kong are all overjoyed, considering it truly a blessing.</p>

<h3>Mr. Pan Gongzhan Lectures on "Unification and Peace"</h3>
<p>Four to Five Hundred Listeners, Elaboration Lasts More Than Two Hours</p>
<p>According to the National Society, the Shanghai YMCA held a special lecture on the Unification and National Salvation Movement at the YMCA Auditorium at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Mr. Pan, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, was invited to lecture on the topic of "Unification and Peace." Mr. Pan vividly elaborated on the meaning of unification, the hope for peace, the connection between unification and peace, and the historical facts of unification and peace in various countries, both domestic and foreign. He also corrected the errors of contemporary people regarding unification and national salvation and pointed out the direction of effort for the people of the country. The lecture lasted an hour and a half. Four to five hundred listeners were very excited. Mr. Pan's speech briefly stated that unification and peace are like the two pans of a balance, and the two have a natural connection.</p>
<p>First, let me discuss peace. Peace is the most pressing need for our country at present. This can be explained in two points: (1) Human nature and the national character of our country both love peace. The ancient saying goes, "The greatest virtue of heaven and earth is life." The character for "nature" [性] is the character for "life" [生] with the heart radical [心]. Humans are the most intelligent of all things and naturally love life. Only peace can ensure survival. When the spring breeze is gentle, plants and trees can sprout. From the perspective of our country's history, we have always advocated "continuing the interrupted lineage, reviving the destroyed state, and being generous in giving and frugal in receiving." The kindness and benevolence of ancient China, which governed the world with kingly ways, cannot be compared to modern imperialists. (2) In the process of the past twenty years since the Xinhai Revolution, we have felt the need for peace even more deeply. Since the demise of the Qing Dynasty, warlords have divided and occupied the country, and the people have lived in deep water and scorching fire every day. Who does not want to quickly turn swords into plowshares and achieve peace so that they can live and work in peace and contentment and strive for construction? If the country does not have peace, there can be no construction. Therefore, the people long for peace as much as a great drought longs for clouds and rain. In fact, in 1936 [Republic Year 25], danger was turned into safety many times. What made this possible? The great power of the entire nation's hope for peace can influence everything. If the entire nation is filled with peace and happiness, the whole country will become prosperous. If struggle and killing fill every unit, what hope is there for the nation? Today, our nation has reached a period of recovery. Therefore, the affairs of humans accord with the times, and there is a phenomenon of long life and abundant harvests. How can we</p>
<p>Achieve Peace? Unification can achieve peace. Without peace, there is war. War arises from separatist forces. Before September 18th [Mukden Incident], there were wars every year because the separatists were eager to act. The Romance of the Three Kingdoms begins by saying, "The general trend of the world is that after a long period of unity, there will be division, and after a long period of division, there will be unity." This statement can encompass our country's past history. What were the national prestige of the Han Wu Emperor era, the national status of the Tang Taizong era, and the situations of the Sixteen Kingdoms, the Northern and Southern Dynasties, the late Yuan Dynasty, and the late Ming Dynasty? When there was division, the people suffered. However, only the unification of Li Shimin [Emperor Taizong of Tang] produced the Zhenguan Reign [period of prosperity], and only the unification of Zhu Yuanzhang [Hongwu Emperor of Ming] produced the early Ming Dynasty's prosperity. Therefore, I dare to conclude that first there must be unification, and then there can be peace. Moreover, if we want to obtain lasting and true peace, the peace obtained through unification is not a superficial peace, but a true peace. Before the Meiji Restoration in Japan, there were frequent domestic disturbances. After the restoration, the abolition of the feudal domains was implemented, all power was concentrated in the central government, the country was unified, and it gradually revived. Therefore, Japan's prosperity is entirely dependent on the abolition of the feudal domains movement, breaking the separatist situation, and achieving successful unification. Japan's success in this unification is based on my Wang Yangming's Confucianism, the so-called Yamato spirit and Bushido, which is actually nothing more than</p>
<p>Revering the King and Expelling the Barbarians. Revering the King and Expelling the Barbarians is our country's treasure. Confucius' spirit in compiling the Spring and Autumn Annals is precisely this: to revere the central government, to expel the Hu people. The new term for "revering the king" is unifying under the central government, and the new term for "expelling the barbarians" is resisting the enemy. Therefore, revering the king and expelling the barbarians is not an antique concept; it is what is called unifying to resist the enemy, but it cannot be reversed and called expelling the barbarians to revere the king, because only by revering the king can one expel the barbarians, and only by unifying can one resist the enemy. This is a matter of course. Unification is what is called internal stability, and resisting the enemy is what is called external defense. Only by achieving internal stability can we defend against external threats; only after unification can we have the strength to resist the enemy and achieve peace. German Chancellor Bismarck established a unified Prussian Federation with Prussia as the center, and only then could the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian Wars be won. The three heroes of Italian nation-building devoted their lives to merging dozens of small states and establishing a unified new country, which is why it has the status it has today. Is this not the power of unification?</p>
<p>Before September 18th, the historical reality of our country should not be blamed on others; it was the inevitability of history. The rapid success of the Xinhai Revolution cannot be entirely attributed to the revolutionaries; it was the natural course of history. Since the unification of China by Qin Shi Huang, commercial capital has gradually developed, resulting in an increasing number of unemployed rural producers. At the appropriate time, the unemployed riot. Our country has had seven or eight such cyclical riots since ancient times. Foreign countries transport the unemployed to colonies to settle them, while our country, after two or three hundred years, sees an increase in the number of unemployed, the central government loses control, and riots recur. The late Qing Dynasty reached this stage. Although the Xinhai Revolution succeeded, the era of the collapse of the central government had not yet passed, so warlords divided and occupied the country. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen founded the Republic of China, not the Chinese Empire, so the warlords did not dare to call themselves kings and cause chaos; this was a great blessing. From</p>
<p>Historical Review, we can see that peace could not be achieved before September 18th. However, after the heroes divided and occupied the country, they would inevitably be unified into one. Mencius said, "The situation will be settled in two." Therefore, without unification, there can be no peace. After division, there must still be unification. However, seeking unification from the warlords is an impossible fact. Therefore, to seek peace, we need to eliminate the separatist forces of the warlords and support unification. We dare to conclude that there is no way to seek true peace except through unification. If we want peace, we must first unify. Some people say that to seek peace, unification is not necessary; there are other methods to consider, such as seeking peace through alliance. How is this prescription? Please elaborate. The English word "United" means "alliance" and can also be said to mean "unification." The two words "United Front" can be translated as</p>
<p>United Front, which is also called unified front. However, there is a difference between alliance and unification. The unification in our country's history has always been a single unit. The permanent maintenance of our nation is based on this spirit. If peace can be sought through alliance, why did the provincial autonomy movement in 1920 [Republic Year 8] not succeed? The union of military governors in 1915 [Republic Year 4] also failed to achieve peace because it was against unification. Opposition to unification means no peace. Seeking peace through alliance is sugar-coated poison. Some people say that foreign countries also have alliances, such as the United States of America. However, after the establishment of the United States, the army, finance, and diplomacy are all in the hands of the central government. Is it like the North China region in our country, which also has a Foreign Affairs Committee? We seek unification to eliminate separatist forces. There are two methods: war and peace. Emperor Taizu of Song [Zhao Kuangyin] released his generals from military command over a cup of wine, which was a peaceful method of seeking peace. There are countless examples of seeking peace through war. The Northern Expedition of the National Revolutionary Army was to seek unification through war and to seek peace through unification. Now the National Government is using peaceful methods to seek unification, but the strength of the central government is not enough. It must rely on the strength of the people to preserve the army,</p>
<p>Eliminate the System, and have the people assist the central government in supervising the military so that they do not interfere in local politics. The National Army is transferred by the central government at any time, and the army and the commanders do not have a fixed relationship. In this way, the elimination of separatism can be achieved through peaceful methods. Seeking unification through peace, seeking peace through unification, and the success of the unification and national salvation movement will bring prosperity to the country.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Water Price Increase, Various Groups Hold a Meeting Yesterday to Oppose</h3>
<p>Decide to Appoint Committee to Form Research Association, Issue Declaration and Petition the Municipal Government for Negotiation</p>
<p>According to the New Sound Society, after the Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British-owned company in the Public Concession, decided to increase the water price from February 1st, changing the 25% discount to a 20% discount according to the company's original price list, various sectors expressed opposition. Various groups, including the First Special District Citizens' Association of this city, held a joint meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss countermeasures. Representatives from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers Association, the First Special District Citizens' Association, the Real Estate Industry Association, the Tenants Association, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the General Labor Union, the Women's Association, the Education Association, and various district branches, including Yu Zhenhui, Li Ao Kui, Zhu Xuefan, Zhu Qizhen, Lin Kecong, Xu Xiaochu, Wan Futian, Liu Zhongying, Wang Manyun, Zhu Zhichun, and others, totaling over a hundred people, elected Li Ao Kui, Cao Zhigong, Yu Zhenhui, Chen Jiufeng, and Chen Weiwen as the presidium.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>After the customary formalities, Chairman Li Ao Kui reported the purpose of the meeting. Shi Cizhou, representative of the Real Estate Industry Association, reported on the company's price increase situation. The following resolutions were then passed: (1) The Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British-owned company in the Public Concession, has suddenly increased its price, which the citizens cannot afford. A petition should be submitted to the municipal government for serious negotiation to maintain the original price. (2) A letter should be sent to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to argue strongly on reasonable grounds. (3) A letter should be sent to the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to review and cancel the price increase and to audit the company's accounts over the years. (4) All users should be notified to deposit all water fees at the original price in the bank before the case is resolved. (5) A committee should be organized to study the water supply problem. (6) A declaration should be issued.</p>
<p>Committee Formation</p>
<p>Twenty-one committee members were appointed to form the Water Supply Problem Research Committee. The list is as follows: Yu Zhenhui, Zhu Xuefan, Cao Zhigong, Chen Jicheng, Li Ao Kui, Chen Jiufeng, Zhu Yangwu, Zhu Qizhi, Chen Weiwen, Zhu Zhichun, Qiu Jialiang, Lin Kecong, Ye Qichang, Wang Manyun, He Yuanming, Zhang Xianfang, Liu Zhongying, Shi Ruozhou, Zhang Yilu, Gu Wensheng, Wan Futian. Li Ao Kui was appointed as the convener, and Zhu Yutao was appointed as the secretary-general of the committee. The committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 2:00 PM on February 3rd and will invite water supply experts to conduct joint research.</p>
<p>Issuance of Declaration</p>
<p>"Since the Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British-owned company, disregarding the difficult times, vaguely requested the approval of the Public Works Department to increase the water price, and decided to increase the water price from February 1st of this year, changing the 25% discount to a 20% discount according to the company's original price list, users who heard the news were deeply indignant. This association and others have specially convened a joint meeting and unanimously decided to oppose it and requested the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department to review and cancel it. Before the case is resolved, the original price will be deposited in the bank. Water is an indispensable necessity for human life. Because rivers in cities are being filled in, residents' drinking water is entirely supplied by tap water. This kind of public utility serves the public and aims at public welfare, which goes without saying. However, the British-owned Waterworks Company engages in speculation and monopoly. In recent years, it has repeatedly increased prices. Before 1928 [Republic Year 17], fees were mostly collected according to rent, first at 5% and then at 6%, which did not cause much harm to users. However, in the spring of 1928 [Republic Year 17], the then-General Manager of the Public Works Department, Mr. Fessenden, concluded a new contract with the company, promising to guarantee interest. Because the company was guaranteed interest, it arbitrarily expanded and issued bonus shares, and frequently increased prices, ordering users to bear the company's huge expenses. Subsequently, the company added new regulations for users to install meters for calculation, setting high prices and harsh methods, which is particularly regrettable. In recent years, this city has been hit by a wave of depression, and the market has declined, and industry and commerce have withered, which is a visible fact. However, the company authorities suddenly took this opportunity to vaguely request the Public Works Department to change the discount and implement a price increase, insisting on going its own way, only seeking profit. Is there still any talk of serving the society? It must be known that the rise and fall of exchange rates are uncertain. Now, the company wants to increase the price because the exchange rate has fallen. Then, why not mention a decrease when it was high before? As for the company's huge expenses, this is the biggest reason for the company's poverty. At this time of hardship, why doesn't the company eliminate redundant personnel and strive to economize to achieve financial rationality? Instead, it fails to come up with this plan and continues to increase the burden on users as a basis for the company's surplus and dividends. Can this kind of policy be sustained? This is a special and solemn declaration, respectfully urging the company authorities to think from the perspective of serving the society, to immediately cancel the agreement to increase the price, and hoping that all compatriots will adhere to their original intentions and wait patiently for a resolution. This is the declaration."</p>

<h3>Hubei Cultural Circles Endorse the Unification and National Salvation Declaration</h3>
<p>The Hubei Branch of the China Cultural Construction Association telegraphed the Shanghai General Association yesterday, saying, "Without unification, there is no way to resist foreign aggression; without construction, there is no way to seek survival. This is a consensus recognized by the entire nation.

<h3>Citizens' Association Sends Letter to Bankers' Association Requesting Cessation of Uncontrolled Issuance of Checks</h3>
<p>Banks Use Acceptance of Deposits as a Method, Allowing Speculators to Deceive Goods and Defraud Money</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Association sent a letter to the Bankers' Association yesterday, stating, "According to a letter from the Fourth District Branch of this association, a general new or old silver company in the city disregards commercial ethics, only cares about greed for profit, and can receive a check by receiving a very low deposit of 50 or 100 yuan without the need for a guarantee, openly publishing advertisements to solicit deposits, intending to deceive with such people, speculators rely on it to deceive goods and defraud money, and issue bad checks everywhere. When it comes to the time for cashing out, nine out of ten are returned, causing the check holder to have no way to recover. In extreme cases, lawsuits are filed according to law, which are delayed for a long time, and merchants suffer pain and losses. Therefore, we specially request your association to investigate, supervise, and urge the banking industry to take care of credit and not issue checks indiscriminately to alleviate the difficulties of merchants."</p>

<p>According to the New Sound Society, in order to facilitate the economic communication between the two provinces of Zhejiang and Jiangxi and develop agriculture, industry, and commerce, the Zhejiang Local Bank and the Jiangxi Yumin Bank have signed a contract to mutually remit and exchange auxiliary currency notes.

Originally scheduled for issuance on New Year's Day this year, it was subsequently delayed because the Ministry ordered that for the sake of unifying the issuance of auxiliary currency notes by provincial banks, the printing should be handled by the Ministry of Finance. The bank immediately complied, and it is expected that the printing will be completed next month. The issuance is scheduled for March 1st.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from Siam, Xu Geding, Returned to China Yesterday for Investigation</h3>
<p>Also Plans to Negotiate the Establishment of the China-Siam Association and Prepare for the Establishment of the Bangkok China National Products Company</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Geding, an overseas Chinese from Siam, has resided in Siam for many years and is highly respected by both the local overseas Chinese community and the Siamese government. He holds several positions, including member of the Executive Committee of the Siam Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, secretary of the China-Siam Association, and principal of the Bangkok Chinese Middle School. This time, urged by various parties, he returned to China yesterday, arriving in Shanghai on a Canadian ship and staying at the Dadong Hotel. It is understood that Mr. Xu's mission in returning to China has approximately three points: ① To investigate domestic industries. China-Siam trade has always been developed, but in recent years, due to the intense dumping of Japanese goods and Siam's efforts at independent development, China's trade with Siam has gradually declined. The Siam Investigation Group led by Ling Bing and Lin Kanghou also deeply felt the need for China-Siam trade after arriving in Siam and actively sought ways to reverse the decline. At that time, the establishment of the China-Siam Association was planned, with Mr. Xu serving as secretary. When Mr. Gao Shiheng led the Nanyang Commercial Investigation Group to Siam, they discussed with Mr. Xu several times and increasingly felt the precariousness of China-Siam trade. In addition to diplomatic negotiations between the two governments, the industrial and commercial circles at home and abroad should also communicate with each other and work together. Mr. Gao asked Mr. Xu to continue his efforts in Siam to establish the China-Siam Association, and also asked him to return to China for investigation, in order to more thoroughly understand the current state of domestic construction and industry and commerce. ② To establish the China-Siam Association. The China-Siam Association has been in preparation for several months, with the domestic headquarters in Nanjing and the Siamese headquarters in Bangkok, with Mr. Xu serving as secretary. Mr. Xu believes that the progress of the association's affairs requires a great deal of contact with the government and industrial and commercial circles, so he had no choice but to return to China in the hope of preparing properly and establishing the association as soon as possible. ③ To prepare for the establishment of the Bangkok China National Products Company. When Mr. Gao Shiheng led the Nanyang Commercial Investigation Group south, it was originally intended to establish China National Products Companies in various places as a permanent mechanism for the Southward sales of national products, in addition to the exhibition. However, due to the circumstances, it was not easy to discuss in the Philippines and Java. Only in Singapore has contact been made with some prospects. In the Siamese capital, he had several contacts with Mr. Xu and other overseas Chinese leaders. Both sides felt the need. Mr. Xu has already raised 70,000 yuan locally and is preparing for establishment. He has come to Shanghai to contact the Joint Office of China National Products to establish close ties in order to actively proceed. He also plans to join the China National Products Joint Company, so he will go to Beijing in the next few days to meet with Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry to discuss everything. It is also heard that the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association has scheduled a banquet for Mr. Xu at Guanshengyuan on February 1st, where domestic and foreign industrial and commercial figures will gather to exchange views on promoting foreign trade over drinks.</p>
<h3>Detailed Record of the Shanghai Literary and Art Community Forum</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: On the 29th of this month, Shanghai literary and art writers Hong Shen, Fu Donghua, Shao Xunmei, Ye Lingfeng, Hu Zhongchi, Gu Zhongyi, and others invited the city's literary and art community to hold a forum, which was briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. More than eighty writers, including Li Qingya and Fu Yanchang, attended. Fang Zhi, Pan Gongzhan, Hong Ruizhao, and others were also invited to attend. During the meeting, the writers expressed many opinions, especially elaborating on the aspects that the literary and art community should work on in the future. The整理ed record of the forum is as follows (the recorder is responsible for any errors):</p>
<p>Shao Xunmei: Almost all of the literary and art friends we invited today have arrived. We feel very honored. Now, on behalf of the six hosts, I will briefly explain the purpose of today's meeting. Most of the friends present today are literary and art writers. These two words "writer" seem to have become a joke. On the one hand, we should blame others for being bad, but on the other hand, we ourselves inevitably have some shortcomings that make people laugh. For many years, the literary and art community has never gained a considerable position in society. The reason is that in the past, most people who wrote literary and art works either praised others or used them as their own pastimes. Now the times have changed, and literary people have more opportunities to contact society. In the past, literary people were considered boring, but now literary people have become interesting and become freelancers. Because they have become freelancers, they must also have an organization like a trade union, so we have a proposal to organize the China Literary and Art Association. In the past, the Shanghai Writers Association and the Writers' Union have been organized several times, but they have never yielded results. Of course, the writers themselves should bear some responsibility, because various intentions were often mixed in this kind of group, so there was no result. The first meaning of our six people inviting you to the meeting today is to hope that in this gathering, we can organize a sound literary and art association and seek a sincere unity of literary and art workers. The second point, as I just said, we are freelancers. According to the latest laws and regulations, people with occupations have to bear income tax. The income tax paid by the freelance industry is particularly heavy, accounting for about 20 percent. This issue is too closely related to our own interests. At the same time, a part of the publishing industry, which has no morals, specializes in printing pirated books. This matter has greatly affected writers in an invisible way. Every pirated book that is published means one less original book. This is also a matter of great concern to writers. Therefore, the second meaning of today's meeting is to discuss how to protect the interests of literary and art writers themselves. Furthermore, we also have a major responsibility at present, which is to be responsible for our own country. In recent years, our country has shown very good signs. The unification that has not been completed for many years has now been roughly completed. Our general literary and art friends should express some opinions, on the one hand, to give those who cannot write articles a considerable understanding, and on the other hand, to encourage our government and be the backing of the government. Now all parties have issued declarations on the unification and national salvation movement. The Shanghai literary and art community has not yet expressed its views, so our six people have prepared a declaration on the unification and national salvation movement for the Shanghai literary and art community. Please consider it and feel free to discuss any additions or deletions. The above points are the reason why our six people convened this forum. Today, it happens that Mr. Fang Xikong, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, is passing through Shanghai. Mr. Fang used to work hard in the literary and art movement, so today we take the opportunity to invite Mr. Fang to participate in this meeting in his personal capacity and express some opinions. Because Mr. Fang has come from afar, let's first ask Mr. Fang to express his opinions.</p>
<p>Fang Zhi: Six hosts, ladies and gentlemen, I am passing through Shanghai on my way to Hangzhou for business. It just so happens that the six hosts invited literary and art colleagues to gather together. I cannot write and have no artistic talent. I feel very honored and excited to be able to participate in this grand event, especially after hearing Mr. Shao's report, which are all issues worth studying and require your comments. In recent years, our literary and art colleagues have been constantly working hard for Chinese literature and art, and the environment in which the literary and art community is currently located is still inevitably difficult. The work I am in charge of is also engaged in cultural undertakings like everyone else. Our goals and interests can be said to be completely the same, so the difficulties that you think need to be resolved, I should also follow you and work hard together and try to resolve them. I often have a feeling that a strong country must rely on material construction on the one hand, and spiritual construction on the other. Spiritual construction, especially cultural undertakings, is of the utmost importance. In any strong country, its cultural development must be advancing in parallel with material development. With these two forces, the foundation of the country can be consolidated. In recent years, our cultural undertakings in the field of spiritual construction have been progressing year by year. The development of cultural undertakings can promote the development of material, which is a fact and does not need to be listed. To take a small thing as an example, on my way to Shanghai this time, I accidentally bought a national conditions pictorial on the train. After reading it once, I felt very excited. I didn't know who was in charge of this pictorial before. As soon as I opened this book, I could fully see that China is a country of revival, with citizen training, mass training, national army, and the situation of Suiyuan's resistance to the enemy, and so on. After reading it, every reader can feel very excited and nervous, and can know that China is gradually having a way now, as long as we bury our heads and work hard. This is just an example I thought of by chance. From this, we can know that spiritual construction and cultural undertakings have a great relationship. Therefore, I feel that to ask China to build a new China, we must work hard on the new cultural movement. Spiritual construction is above all else. With spiritual construction, material construction is not a problem. I hope everyone will work hard together. Secondly, I am a member of the central cultural undertaking. I hope that everyone will contribute opinions to the central government, so that the cultural undertakings that the central government urgently needs to promote and the local cultural undertakings can be integrated to jointly develop China's cultural undertakings. This is my greatest wish. Shanghai is the cultural center of China. You are almost all leaders of the national literary and art community. I would very much like to hear your opinions on cultural undertakings, especially the literary and art movement in the future. Now I don't want to waste your precious time. After you express your opinions, if I have any opinions, I will contribute a little bit. Please give me your advice. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Special Cash Guarantee Measures (Continued)</h3>
<p>Full Text Released by the Banking Association</p>
<p>The Meaning of Type A, B, and C Guarantees and Their Payment Methods</p>
<p>Type A Guarantee (3 Months' Salary): After the cancellation of guarantors, a corresponding guarantee deposit must be paid to serve as a guarantee. To increase protection, it was originally possible to stipulate the payment of one year's or half a year's salary. However, fearing that employees would not be able to raise funds during this period of social and economic hardship, the amount was adjusted to three times the monthly salary. This is easier than finding a guarantor and will greatly increase interest rates. Half of the interest will still be paid to the employee. In this way, the guarantee deposit is equivalent to savings and will not be wasted. Half of it will be allocated to the public reserve fund, and the principal will be stored separately and returned in full when the employee leaves the bank. For payment methods, in order to facilitate fundraising, it can be paid according to the following methods:</p>
<p>For current employees, the following three methods can be used to raise and pay the guarantee deposit: (A) One-third will be allocated from the employee's existing savings (if the bank does not have employee savings, it can be paid half and half from items B and C). (B) One-third will be allocated from the year-end bonus (pre-appropriated at the time of implementation). (C) One-third will be paid in installments (the time limit is determined by the bank).</p>
<p>New Employees: Pay in full at once.</p>
<p>Type B Guarantee (2% of Monthly Salary): This is a substitute for the cancellation of guarantors, and is equivalent to the insurance premium for group credit insurance. It does not need to be refunded. However, out of consideration for the employees, it can be refunded in full when they leave the bank if no fraud has occurred, or the balance can be recovered after compensation. This combines the intention of savings with the guarantee. It is called "guaranteed savings." The limit is also extremely low. The payment method is as follows: (A) In banks that have already established employee savings, 2% can be allocated from the monthly savings. (B) Deduct from the monthly salary on a monthly basis.</p>
<p>Type C Guarantee: If the bank suffers losses due to employee fraud, the bank is not without responsibility. Therefore, the bank stipulates that several tens of thousands of yuan will be allocated each year. The amount can be based on the sum of half of the interest on the Type A guarantee and the full amount of the Type B guarantee as a standard. It is used as a Type C guarantee to strengthen the guarantee force, to show that it cooperates with the employees and shares the joys and sorrows. The allocation method is (A) Allocate a fixed amount from the expenditure item (paying the employee's Type C guarantee is equivalent to the insurance premium for group credit insurance). (B) Verify and allocate from the surplus item (extracting employee guarantee reserves).</p>
<p>From the above, it can be proved that when the special cash guarantee method is implemented, the payment of the Type A guarantee is not slightly difficult. The refund of the Type B guarantee has a positive effect, and the employees feel the same sense of self-interest in order to eliminate the motive for fraud. It is not like the insurance premium paid to a credit insurance company, which is like a donation and is indifferent. The Type C guarantee is the bank's determination to improve the guarantee system in order to strengthen the guarantee force. In a considerable period of time, the bank can verify and propose a certain amount to organize employee welfare facilities to improve the employees' morality, intelligence, physique, and group cultivation.</p>
<p>This method also stipulates "joint and several punishments" to promote the spirit of internal restraint, and "rewarding whistleblowing" to achieve the effect of preventing in advance and achieve the purpose of preventing fraud. Therefore, although the Type A guarantee is three times the monthly salary, it does not lose the effectiveness of the entire guarantee, and the payment of the Type B guarantee is the essence of this method.</p>
<p>Advantages of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method"</p>
<p>I. For Banks:</p>
<p>First, after the implementation of this method, the guarantee reserve fund is indeed available, and the bank can avoid the huge losses suffered by employee fraud every year under the current empty-word insurance policy system.</p>
<p>Second, after the current insurance policy system is abolished, the bank can save the huge expenses incurred each year in the investigation of employee guarantors, guarantee documents, telegrams, letters, etc. (the expenses of various banks in our country are huge every year).</p>
<p>Third, after the current insurance policy system is abolished, the bank can avoid various lawsuits against the guarantor and the guarantor against the fraudster.</p>
<p>Fourth, in order to change the current "unlimited guarantee" to "limited guarantee," the amount of the guarantee must be determined separately and in detail. If the regulations are too small, the protection will be insufficient. If the regulations are too large, the employees may not be able to find a guarantor. The "Special Cash Guarantee Method" also has the effect of mutual supervision in spirit, so there is no such disadvantage of being unevenly weighted.</p>
<p>Fifth, some people say that the current insurance policy system can have the effect of the guarantor supervising the employee. However, according to the facts, more than half of the employee guarantors are not in the same place as the guaranteed employee. According to statistics from a large bank, more than 68% of the guarantors and employees live in different places, that is, the guarantor of A is in B, and the guarantor of B is in C. Moreover, the salary and bank personnel management system values ​​the transfer of employees' duties after a considerable period of time. Therefore, those who serve in Branch A this year may be transferred to Branch B next year. This is always the case, and it is impossible for the guarantor to change with the transfer of the employee. Therefore, the above-mentioned section on the guarantor supervising the employee is not entirely reliable. Moreover, the preparation of the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is always available, and the joint and several punishment is far better than the supervision of the guarantor.</p>
<p>Sixth, the implementation of this method can improve the employee's morality and at the same time improve the bank's reputation.</p>
<p>Seventh, because of mutual guarantees and shared interests, all employees can not only scrutinize others at any time, but also be able to restrain themselves and not be tempted by external objects. Even if there is a slight suspicion of impropriety, all colleagues will be afraid of being implicated and will report it together. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Wu Ziliang and Others Sentenced with Varying Degrees of Imprisonment for Arson for Insurance Money</h3>
<p>Zhang Kuibo and Huang Changgen Receive Heavy Sentences; Wu Ziliang Receives a Lighter Sentence; All Others Acquitted</p>
<p>The Menpi Fanfanghua Clothing Company at No. 548 Fuzhou Road was established by the Suzhou brothers Wu Ziliang and Wu Songsen with a capital of 18,000 yuan. It has been in operation for more than five years. It has taken out fire insurance policies with four foreign firms, including Great Britain, Dalailulin, and Dianchang, for a total of 50,000 yuan. Due to poor business and heavy losses, Zhang Kuibo, the accountant from Zhejiang, came up with the idea of arson for insurance money. Zhang found Huang Changgen, a habitual arsonist from Zhenjiang, and obtained the consent of Wu Ziliang. On the night of the 21st of this month, at 2:40 a.m., they filled the store with gasoline and reeds and set it on fire. The Fire Brigade received the report and rushed to extinguish the fire. After the incident, Lu Gengsheng, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Laozha Police Station, and Detective Zhu Shangwu, discovered loopholes and arrested Zhang Kuibo, Wu Ziliang, Huang Changgen, Wu Songsen, and insurance broker Chen Jianian. After interrogation by the First Special District Court, Wu Songsen and Chen Jianian were released on bail, and the others were returned to prison. Qian Hongye, the judge of the criminal court who was hearing the case, went to the scene on Tuesday this week to inspect the scene in order to understand the truth. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday was the date for the final hearing of the case. Ru Baoyi, the lawyer of the police station, prosecuted according to Article 173 of the Criminal Law, the crime of endangering public safety (the highest sentence is indefinite imprisonment), and did not prosecute Chen Jianian, requesting the revocation of his bail. Hui Ershi, a Westerner from the Far East Public Notary Office of the Fire Brigade, and Hawke, a Westerner, testified about the circumstances of the fire at the time and the reeds and broken pieces of goldfish bowls found at the scene after the incident. Zhang Kuibo and Huang Changgen both confessed to the joint arson, while Wu Ziliang confessed to conspiracy beforehand, and Wu Songsen completely denied it. After the lawyers of both sides argued, Judge Qian announced the verdict in court: Zhang Kuibo was sentenced to nine years and six months of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for seven years for jointly setting fire to a building where people were present; Wu Ziliang was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment for the same crime; Huang Changgen was sentenced to fourteen years of imprisonment and deprived of civil rights for ten years for the same crime; Wu Songsen was found not guilty; Chen Jianian was released.</p>
<h3>Girls Awaiting Matching at the Chapei Charity Group's Foster Home</h3>
<p>Many Applicants Fail to Qualify; The Home Specifically Announces Regulations</p>
<p>Since the Chapei Charity Group's foster home has had five girls available for marriage, numerous individuals from various quarters have continuously applied for a match. However, due to unqualified family circumstances or incorrect procedures, no matches have been successfully made. To ensure clarity for all sectors, the group has formulated concise regulations for selecting a marriage partner for the fostered girls. These are recorded below: ❶ Women fostered by our home, after being sent from various institutions, will have their photographs taken and submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau monthly to be announced in newspapers for family members to claim. If, after one year, no family members come forward, and they are 16 years of age or older, our home will arrange a marriage in accordance with regulations. ❶ For the women being matched by our home, the male applicant must first submit a request letter with an attached photograph, stating his name, place of origin, age, occupation, and address, and come to the home with an introducer before being allowed to view the candidates. Only after both the male applicant and the woman being matched agree, and after the director and supervisors dispatch personnel to conduct a thorough investigation, will the matter be reported to the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping. Then, a commercial guarantee must be obtained, and a date selected for the wedding ceremony. Two photographs will be taken at the home, one kept by the home and one given to the married couple for their possession. ❶ The male applicant must pay one hundred silver dollars to subsidize the home's expenses. ❶ The male applicant must have a legitimate occupation and must not abuse the woman after marriage or force her into servitude or sell her. If any violation occurs, the married woman is allowed to report to the home. If our home verifies the evidence, we will send a letter to the authorities for punishment. ❶ If, after one year of fostering, the girl is still unclaimed by her family and is under the age of twelve, individuals with a stable occupation and without children may adopt her as a daughter. They must provide a detailed list of the adopter's name, age, place of origin, address, and occupation, which will be sent to the home by an introducer for verification. A solid commercial guarantee is also required before the girl can be released. ❶ After the girl is released, a charitable fee of a certain amount of silver dollars should be paid based on one's ability to subsidize the home's expenses. ❶ If, after the girl is adopted and released, her biological parents come forward to claim her within one year, they should still be allowed to reunite with their daughter. The adoptive parents must not create difficulties. ❶ The adoptive family must treat the girl as their own child, providing her with good care and not subjecting her to treatment, sale, or servitude. If any violation is discovered, the original guarantor will be held responsible for retrieving the adopted girl and sending her to the authorities for punishment. ❶ If the adopted girl is married, dies from illness, or goes missing, the adoptive family must report it to the home immediately for investigation. ❶ Every spring and autumn, our group will send personnel to conduct investigations of the married women and adopted daughters. The married individuals and the families of the adopted daughters must not refuse under any pretext, to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<h3>Liu Shancai's Crimes Compounded</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Two Years and Eight Months; Opium Case Awaiting Sentencing</p>
<p>Liu Yingcai, a fifteen-year-old Sino-Russian mixed-race man from Vladivostok, living at 1291 Route Lafayette, whose father used to work at Customs, and whose sister, named De Fan, works as a dancer, has recently been unemployed. Exploiting his resemblance to Westerners, he impersonated a Western detective and colluded with accomplices Qu Shouyi and Zhang Baoxi, etc., to rob Wang Yushan at No. 2 Renshou Lane, Route Petain, and Hu Ruixiang at No. 105 Gansidong Road, on the pretext of searching for heroin. The victims reported the matter to the French Concession Police, who arrested Liu, Qu, and Zhang and sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and detention. While in custody, Liu, addicted to opium, bribed guard Zhang Shanhe (28 years old, from Zhenjiang) to buy opium bubbles for him to smuggle in and smoke. Another guard discovered this and found five and a half opium bubbles on Liu. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhang Shanhe had purchased them, so Zhang was detained and sent to the French Concession Police Department for investigation and then to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. These matters have already been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the robbery case of Liu et al. has been investigated by Judge Sun Penghuan, and the verdict was issued the day before yesterday. Liu Yingcai was sentenced to two years and eight months imprisonment for robbery in a residential area at night with a handgun and for illegally searching others without legal authorization. Qu Shouyi was sentenced to six months imprisonment. Zhang Baoxi's crime could not be proven, and he was declared innocent. Victim Hu Ruixiang filed a civil suit against Liu, and Liu Yingcai was ordered to compensate Hu Ruixiang thirty yuan. Furthermore, regarding the opium case involving Liu Yingcai and Zhang Shanhe, Judge Chen Shuoying of the Second Special District Court presided over a continued trial in the First Criminal Court yesterday morning. The Police Department lawyer charged Liu with possessing opium and Zhang with the crime of covering up the transportation of opium in his official capacity. Upon questioning, Liu admitted to asking Zhang to purchase it, but Zhang stubbornly denied it. The court verified the confessions, declared the debate closed, and scheduled a date for sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Customs Utilizes Extremely Low Water Levels to Successfully Destroy the Kongling Shoal in Yichang</h3>
<p>Difficult Rocks Exposed by the Low Water Enable a Successful Operation; The Entire Project Can Be Completed During the Low Water Season; Customs Sincerely Appeals to Shipping Merchants for Cooperation</p>
<p>The Yichang to Chongqing shipping route in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River requires passage through the Kongling Shoal. Even the slightest carelessness can easily lead to grounding and accidents. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry with Customs, the Customs authorities are taking advantage of the exceptionally low river levels to make smooth progress in destroying the shoal, and success is imminent, which is good news for the shipping industry. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Kongling Shoal Rocks</p>
<p>The Kongling Shoal South Channel, located about 30 nautical miles upstream of Yichang in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, features jagged rocks that pose a significant hazard to navigation. Even the slightest carelessness by ships traveling between Yichang and Chongqing can lead to grounding and accidents. Despite repeated blasting operations by Customs, success has remained elusive due to the water concealing the rocks.</p>
<p>Successful Destruction</p>
<p>Recently, the Yangtze River has experienced unusually low water levels not seen in years. The water volume in the Yichang section is especially low, and the shoal has largely emerged from the water. Therefore, Customs has been able to seize this opportunity to carry out blasting operations, achieving remarkable success. According to the reporter's inquiries with Customs, the entire shoal demolition project can be completed during this low-water period.</p>
<p>Sincere Announcement</p>
<p>As the shoal demolition project nears completion, Customs is also seeking the cooperation of vessels traveling in the area to ensure its early completion. A special announcement has been issued: Regarding the announcement, the Kongling Shoal South Channel demolition project is currently underway. With the current exceptionally low river levels, success is within reach. However, the cooperation of all navigators is especially important. Therefore, all ships traveling upstream and downstream must exercise extreme caution when passing through the Kongling Shoal. Prioritize the safety of the vessel and proceed at the lowest possible speed to avoid hindering the project. This is a sincere announcement.</p>
<h3>Mother and Child Both Suffer Coal Gas Poisoning While Sleeping Indoors</h3>
<p>Zhang Dexing, a 36-year-old man from Jinhua, and his wife, Wang (28 years old), lived in a loft at No. 1, Lane 277, Chezhan Road in the Nanshi district. Yesterday morning, after Zhang Dexing went out, Wang lit a coal briquette stove in the room to keep warm. After lunch, she closed the door tightly and napped with her son (named Gendi, one year old), resulting in both mother and child suffering from coal gas poisoning. When her husband returned home at about 5 p.m., he knocked on the door but received no response. He managed to pry the door open and found that his son Gendi had already died and could not be saved. His wife was also severely poisoned and was immediately taken to Shanghai Hospital by hired car for treatment.</p>
<h3>Five-Year-Old Child Kidnapped, Ransom Demanded</h3>
<p>Xue Rongchang, a 32-year-old man from Yangzhou, residing at No. 33 Changsheng Lane, Liyi Ferry, Pudong, works at the No. 3 Factory of Shanghai Jianyi. His family is moderately well-off. His son, Gendi, only five years old, suddenly went missing at around 11 a.m. on the 26th of this month. He did not return that evening. Fearing that he was lost, Xue searched everywhere but could not find him. Unexpectedly, yesterday, he received a letter from bandits stating that the child had been kidnapped and demanding a ransom of one thousand yuan for his return. The letter was signed "Li," with no contact location provided. The Pudong Branch Bureau has ordered the detective team to rigorously investigate.</p>
<h3>Robbers Raid Village Boat; Boat Woman Drowns</h3>
<p>Recently, a case of robbers sinking a boat and drowning a boat owner in the Yangsi Port near Sanlintang, Pudong, occurred. A rural boat was docked in the port, and the boat owner was a middle-aged woman who had saved some private funds. The robbers learned of her wealth. On a dark night, they found out that the woman was sleeping alone on the boat guarding it. About six or seven of them gathered, swarmed onto the boat, woke the woman, and threatened her with guns, forcing her to hand over the hidden banknotes. The woman, startled from her sleep, pretended to be extremely poor. The robbers searched everywhere but could not find anything. They searched her body as well, but did not find a single coin. Greatly disappointed, the robbers suspected she was lying. They tied her tightly to the bottom of the cabin, preventing her from moving. Then, they broke a large hole in the bottom of the boat. Port water poured in through the hole, and the boat gradually sank. The woman cried for help but received no response. Before long, she tragically drowned. Seeing that they had vented their anger, the robbers went ashore and fled. The incident occurred at the border between the Shangnan and Liangxian counties, about thirty miles from Shanghai. It was heard that the next morning, the villagers discovered the incident and reported it to the supervisory officials for investigation. In order to understand the robbers' motives, they thoroughly searched the boat and the body. Indeed, a sum of banknotes was found in the lining of the deceased's cotton-padded coat. Apparently, the robbers had not noticed this, otherwise, the woman would not have sacrificed her life.</p>

<h3>Customs Regulations Regarding Bottle Capacity of Imported Beverages</h3>

Bottles with a capacity exceeding half a liter but not exceeding one liter will be calculated as "bottle." ❶ Except for small bottles that are indeed for samples, any bottle containing less than the maximum capacity of a "half bottle" as stipulated in the tariff or these notes will be taxed at the "half bottle" rate. Any bottle containing more than a "half bottle" but less than the maximum capacity of a "bottle" will be taxed at the "bottle" rate. Bottles containing more than the maximum capacity of a "bottle" will be taxed proportionally. ❸ For small bottles not exceeding half the maximum capacity of a "half bottle" as stipulated in the tariff and these notes, the tax levied will be half of the "half bottle" rate. All importers are to be informed of this announcement. Superintendent Zhu Changnian, Customs Commissioner Baron.</p>
<h3>Baker Arrived in Shanghai the Day Before Yesterday</h3>

<p>Dr. Baker, the new General Secretary of the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, arrived in Shanghai on the Shanghai Maru at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday to take up his new post.

In May of last year, he went to various countries to raise funds and originally intended not to return to China. However, due to the resignation of the association's General Secretary Zhang Yuanshan due to personal reasons, Baker was invited to China to succeed him.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Magician Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that an Egyptian mentalist, named Hamed Bey, recently arrived in the city. The other day, he performed his magic for the first time in front of a representative of the Shanghai Times at the International Hotel. First, he asked the representative to tear three pieces of paper from a notepad, write a question on each, fold them four times, crumple them in his palm, and then place them on the table. Then, the magician wrote symbols on them. After a few minutes, he said that he could explain the questions written on each paper. He then asked the representative to report the numbers written on the papers, as they had been marked with numbers in advance. The representative reported a number, and the magician immediately recited the words, which matched what was written. But this was just the first step. He then asked the representative to hold a folded piece of paper and a pen firmly in his right hand. The magician pressed his left-hand fingers firmly on the back of the representative's fist and wrote symbols on it with his right hand. After a few seconds, he told the representative to open his hand and look at the paper. Answers to the questions were written on it. Throughout the performance, the guard did not touch the papers at all. It is said that the words were written by an automatic spirit.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Gentry Mu Shuzai Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>High Blood Pressure Suddenly Led to Cerebral Hemorrhage; Encoffining Today, Cremation in Two Days</p>
<p>Mu Shuzai (also known as Shuzai), a former Chief of the Songhu Police Department, Chairman of the Shangnan Transportation Company, Chairman of the South Shanghai Fire Brigade, and currently a standing committee member of the Shanghai South District Fire Joint Association, Head of the Nanshi Defense Corps, and founder of the Jide and Hengda Cotton Mills, passed away yesterday at his residence, the Shuzai Lane, which he had built himself outside Xiaoximen, Huangjiaque Road, Nanshi. He was sixty-four years old. Unexpectedly, on the 23rd of this month, Mu suddenly suffered a severe cerebral hemorrhage. After falling ill, he immediately became delirious and unable to speak. His family hurriedly sought the consultation of famous Chinese and Western doctors, but to no avail. Later, he was sent to Binlong Hospital on Baker Road, but despite the doctors' best efforts, he passed away in the hospital at half-past noon yesterday due to old age and physical weakness. Upon hearing the news, friends from all quarters expressed their deep condolences. Mu's family has scheduled the encoffining for 2 p.m. today at the Wanguo Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road. In accordance with Mu's will, made at the age of forty, the cremation will be held at the Public Concession Crematorium at 10 a.m. on the 2nd of next month.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Xu Yi Sues Cheng Linsheng's Wife for False Accusation</h3>
<p>Endless Litigation Between Relatives; Excessive Legal Fees of Twenty Thousand</p>
<p>Lawyer Xu Yi, who was convicted and removed from his position due to accusations by Cheng Li Tianzhi, the wife of real estate tycoon Cheng Linsheng, and her brother Li Quanyuan, sued Cheng Li Tianzhi for some of the charges against Xu Yi in the 24th year of the Republic. The local court sentenced him to four months, but the Jiangsu High Court overturned the verdict. Therefore, Xu Yi is now privately prosecuting Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Quanyuan in the local court for false accusations.</p>
<p>The Complaint States: Cheng Li Tianzhi, with her brother Li Quanyuan as guarantor, hired the plaintiff as a legal advisor for nearly two years. When the plaintiff sent a written reminder for payment of legal fees, Cheng Li Tianzhi not only denied owing money but also, in collusion with Li Quanyuan, falsely accused him of crimes such as forgery to the court last year and secretly bribed lawyer Yang Shaopeng to Judge Tan Zhuohong, who was presiding over the case, to first detain the plaintiff on abuse of power and then wrongly sentenced him. Only after an appeal was the verdict overturned and the case settled. Therefore, he requests punishment and seeks compensation for losses, such as damages to his reputation, health, and business, as well as litigation expenses, totaling over thirty thousand yuan. After the court notified the defendants, they hired lawyer Li Lin to respond, stating that the public prosecution of Xu Yi's case was initiated by Prosecutor Li Fen, who believed that there were indeed criminal suspects based on the accusations and the results of the investigation. If the accusations and the results of the investigation were extremely inconsistent, then Prosecutor Li would have filed a public prosecution for false accusation, as stipulated by the Criminal Procedure Law. The fact that the plaintiff was sentenced to four months imprisonment in this case, and the High Court overturned the verdict, only means that the legal opinions of the prosecutor and judge in the first instance differed. They believed that the evidence of the crime was insufficient. The plaintiff did not present any active counter-evidence, so the charge of false accusation cannot stand. This is supported by a precedent from the Supreme Court from the 20th year of the Republic, No. 307. As for Yang Shaopeng and Tan Zhuohong, they are even more falsely accused. This is evidenced by the non-prosecution order issued by the First Special District Court in response to the plaintiff's accusation of bribery against Li Quanyuan. Yesterday, Judge Li Xuedeng opened the court and first questioned Cheng Ji Tianzhi, 52 years old, registered in She County, Anhui, residing at No. 296 Saporse Road. He then questioned Li Quanyuan, 47 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 120 Guizhou Road. He then questioned Xu Yi, 31 years old, former lawyer, from Zhongshan, Guangdong, residing at No. 13, Lane 171, Tangshan Road. The judge asked Xu Yi, "Who are you accusing?" Xu Yi replied, "Cheng Li Tianzhi and Li Quanyuan, for jointly making false accusations, because</p>
<p>they are relatives harboring resentment." The plaintiff had been owed legal fees for two years, so he sent a letter urging payment. Unexpectedly, the two defendants falsely accused him in court, resulting in a four-month sentence, which was overturned by the High Court. He requests that the two defendants be punished for their crimes. As for the bribery case reported to the Special District Court, it was not accepted due to an error in jurisdiction. He requests that it be consolidated for trial. At this point, Cheng Li Tianzhi testified that when the High Court was hearing the case on November 11th of the 24th year of the Republic, she voluntarily abandoned the legal fees, claiming that two thousand taels of silver were enough, which proves that he forged documents. At this point, Li Quanyuan testified that he did not falsely accuse him. Besides, he is my nephew-in-law, and his wife's mother is my sister, the sister of Li Tianzhi. According to the lawyer's regulations, how could the legal fees</p>
<p>amount to two thousand taels? I am the manager of the Gentai Factory, and he also helped in the factory. He had many opportunities to steal the Gentai seal. Recently, he was in the First Special District Court for eight months and was released not long ago, also for matters related to Gentai. At this point, Xu Yi stated that there was a reason for abandoning the two thousand taels in legal fees. Chief Judge Luo argued that Cheng Li Tianzhi's husband was already bankrupt, and I had lent them seventy thousand taels. If it is said that two thousand taels is too much, there is a reason for this. Her husband lost tens of millions of assets. During the previous case she filed against me, they spent over ten thousand taels, and Yang Shaopeng spent more than four thousand taels in court fees. The court hearing was adjourned for further questioning at another date.</p>
<h3>The First Special District Local Court Burns Confiscated Drugs</h3>
<p>Yesterday Was the Twenty-Seventh Time</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court, in accordance with regulations, burns all opium and various drugs confiscated in drug cases every three months. Yesterday was the twenty-seventh scheduled burning. Recently, the Public Concession Police have been particularly diligent in handling drug cases, so the amount of confiscated drugs was more than in previous sessions. Therefore, President Guo requested permission from the Chief Judge to use the South Shouyi Tomb as the drug burning site and invited representatives from various agencies to supervise the process. Yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m., representatives from the Ministry of Justice, the Prosecutor of the High Court Second Branch, Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the Legal Department of the Public Works Department, and representatives from the Songhu Garrison Command all attended. President Guo ordered Gao Gongshou, the director of the treasury of seized goods, to present each item of drugs to be burned for inspection before throwing them into the fire. The process concluded at 4 p.m. The drugs destroyed yesterday included: 97 taels and 166 grams of opium, 38 small cans, 46 small boxes, 15 small packets of opium residue, 2 and a half vats of opium paste, 30 taels and 24 small cans, 6 small boxes, and 1 item; 26 pounds and 125 taels of red pills, 3,190 Hancao pills, 6 pounds of raw material and 2 taels of pill residue, half a can of pill ash, and a small packet; half a can, two small basins of red pill paste, 2 packets of white powder, 4 taels and 9999 of opium bubbles, 31 small opium bubbles, 8 packets and one small packet of opium ashes; 14 and a half pounds and 22 taels, 3 packets, 6 small packets, 3 cans, 7 and a half cans, 2 and a half small vats, and one bowl, a small jar, a bull vat, and 35 items; 6 taels of opium pills; a small packet of opium residue, 2 small vats and four items; one pound and 316 taels of morphine, and 59 small packets; one and a half taels and 34 grams of heroin, 1329 small packets, two small cans, and 13 items; three small packets of coffee essence; and over 2502 pieces of opium paraphernalia.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Break In, Victim Stabbed Five Times After Finding Nothing</h3>
<p>Zhu Shanchao, a resident of a grass hut in Tianxinanshou, Bingchang Road, Pudong, Taizhou, made a living by raising pigs. Recently, he sold two piglets and earned 9,000 yuan, which was discovered by robbers. At around midnight the night before last, a group of three men with a Jiangbei accent, wearing short-sleeved and short trousers and blackening their faces with ash, aged about twenty or thirty, broke into the house while Zhu's family was asleep, intending to rob them. Zhu and his family were awakened from their sleep. The robbers demanded that he hand over the money from the pigs, but Zhu claimed that it had already been spent. The robbers searched but found nothing, and in anger, they took out a seven-inch-long sharp knife and stabbed Zhu five times in the arms and thighs. They then grabbed more than ten pieces of single-layer clothing and fled. Fortunately, Zhu's injuries were not serious, and he bandaged himself without going to the hospital. At dawn, Zhu's wife, Yu, reported the incident to the Pudong Police Station and requested an investigation. Director Zhang, believing that the robbers' blackened faces indicated that they were familiar with the victim, ordered the detective team to investigate.</p>
<h3>Shen A'wu, 34, Addicted to Heroin for Twelve Years</h3>
<p>Shen A'wu, 34 years old, a local resident living at No. 28, Sanpailou in the city, bought three small packets of heroin from a Korean man at Huile Lane on Fuzhou Road for two jiao on the afternoon of the 17th of this month due to a drug addiction. While returning home, he was found to be suspicious by officer No. 82 of the French Concession Police and two Russian officers, Nos. 27 and 23, on Dongzilaihuo Street in the French Concession. They found the drugs on his person, took him to the police station, and sent him to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After investigation by Judge Peng Huan, he was sentenced yesterday to twelve years imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for ten years for using heroin. He will be detained in the detention center during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Sixteen-Year-Old Child Unfit to Be a University Teacher</h3>
<p>A Lawsuit in the Education Sector Between Xu Mushi and Fan Rencai</p>
<p>Xu Mushi, a native of Yuyao, graduated from St. Francis College in the summer of the 19th year of the Republic. He then founded the Mushi English Night School in the Yiyuan, which offered high school level and junior high school classes and had a large enrollment. Opposite his school, in a lane on Fuyou Road, was the Wushi Commercial English Night School, run by Fan Rencai. Xu Mushi had been a teacher there in August of the 19th year of the Republic. Fan Rencai printed in the school's enrollment brochure that Xu Mushi was a student of the school and, after being strictly managed by the school, was able to serve as the principal of the Mushi Night School. Xu Mushi was very angry. He argued that the Wushi Night School, which had previously used aviation lottery tickets, offered a scholarship with a grand prize to anyone who introduced a student, but failed to attract enrollments. They then listed him as a student in order to mislead outsiders into believing in his knowledge and to transfer to their school, which was despicable. He requested that the Social Affairs Bureau investigate the matter. Yu Jianmin was sent to investigate, and Fan Rencai presented Xu Mushi's registration application, which mentioned Wang Yongfang as the school's typing director and teacher, and Xu Mushi's teacher, etc. Xu argued that Wang Yongfang was only 22 years old this year and only 16 years old in the 19th year of the Republic. How could a child be a university graduate and teacher? Moreover, Wang was still a student at the Yimiao Commercial Yiwu School in the spring of the 19th year of the Republic, while he himself had graduated from Zhenhua Typing School as early as the 17th year of the Republic. St. Francis also had a typing course, so why would he go to Wushi to study? Moreover, in August of the 19th year of the Republic, he and all the teachers and staff of Fan Rencai's school took a photo together, which of course meant that some were staff and some were teachers. There were definitely no students being referred to as teachers. The registration form and application were clearly forged. He filed a private lawsuit against Fan Rencai in the local court for defamation and forgery. Due to procedural errors, the court ruled that it could not be accepted. Therefore, Xu Mushi appealed the defamation part to the Jiangsu High Court. For the remaining parts, he reported to the prosecutor, and Prosecutor Wang summoned both parties for investigation. He argued that he would issue a subpoena to continue taking evidence. Yesterday, he received a subpoena again. The prosecutor argued that because the case file had been taken away by the High Court, the investigation could not begin. He should wait for the High Court's appeal decision before further review.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Benevolent and Orphan Association Held Its Eighth Annual Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>President Kong Xiangxi Personally Presided, Passing the Work Outline for the 26th Year</p>
<p>The Chinese Benevolent and Orphan Association held its eighth annual meeting yesterday (the 30th) at 3 PM in the Zhongshan Hall of the YMCA on Museum Road. In addition to re-electing executive committee members and reporting on association affairs, three temporary proposals were passed. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Attendees: Yesterday’s attendees included members and guests such as Kong Xiangxi, Wu Zhencheng, (Li Ting’an representing), Pan Gongzhan, (Zhang Binghui representing), Yu Yiting, Xue Wanqiang, Lin Kanghou, Mao Yun, Qu Wenliu, Liu Ruiheng, Zhao Jinqing, Xu Jianping, Chen Zhensheng, and over fifty others, presided over by President Kong Xiangxi.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: After the customary formalities, President Kong delivered a speech, saying, “Gentlemen, ladies, today is the day we hold the eighth annual meeting of this association. We all feel very happy and invigorated. With so many distinguished guests present, the president and colleagues of this association feel even more fortunate and grateful. This association was established in April of the 17th year of the Republic of China. It has been nearly nine years. In the past nine years, although the funds and staff of this association have been limited, my colleagues have worked diligently and made gradual progress, never daring to slacken. In the past, we have also received assistance from many sympathetic people in society who have provided support in various ways with their spirit, time, and money. This association has been able to show a small degree of achievement in its work. To list some of the more significant achievements, we have promoted Children's Day and held benevolent and orphan sports meetings, held national benevolent and orphan conferences, encouraged the establishment of benevolent and orphan associations in various regions, helped emerging benevolent and orphan causes, built the Nanjing Benevolent and Orphan Experimental Zone, initiated the Shanghai Benevolent and Orphan Group Mutual Aid Committee, sent personnel to investigate benevolent and orphan causes abroad, participated in international family education conferences and the Far Eastern Conference on the Prohibition of Trafficking in Women and Children, published the Modern Parents Monthly, published publications on benevolent and orphan issues, held lectures on benevolent and orphan issues, conducted children's research work, operated benevolent and orphan nurseries, benevolent and orphan training centers, benevolent and orphan elementary schools, benevolent and orphan clinics, benevolent and orphan tuberculosis sanatoriums, held children's health campaigns and children's health competitions, handled cases of child abuse, protected homeless children, promoted children's laws and children's courts, and provided relief to disaster-stricken children in various regions. However, when it comes to these small achievements, we must give credit to the cooperation and efforts of the benevolent and orphan comrades in general. I hope that everyone can continue to cooperate so that the future of our Republic of China can have a more solid foundation. Everyone, recalling last year in the first month, when this association held its seventh annual meeting, I said that we are conducting the cause of benevolence and orphans not merely as a charitable undertaking, but as a social and national salvation undertaking. Charitable undertakings are naturally commendable, but they are ultimately passive rather than active. As for the undertakings of this association, although a small part is passive, such as providing relief to disaster-stricken children in various regions and rescuing abused child laborers and maids, most of the undertakings are active. For example, promoting Children's Day, holding national benevolent and orphan conferences, encouraging the establishment of benevolent and orphan associations in various regions, publishing the Modern Parents Monthly, publishing parenting studies and parenting education wall charts, holding lectures on benevolent and orphan issues, conducting children's research work, promoting parenting education, holding children's health campaigns, and advocating the use of the latest scientific methods to educate children throughout the country, this association hopes not only to enable children throughout the country to be free from hardship and abuse, but also to enable children throughout the country to have healthy bodies and healthy minds so that they can create a healthy Republic of China. In this way, the undertakings of this association are naturally a far-reaching undertaking of national salvation, not just a passive charitable undertaking. Promoting children's happiness is naturally our direct goal, but our ultimate goal is to promote the happiness of the Chinese nation and to complete the construction of the Republic of China by promoting children's happiness. This point is very important, and I would like to emphasize it again at this annual meeting and solemnly state it to everyone. I think everyone will be able to sympathize with and approve of this. Everyone, when we discuss the cause of benevolence and orphans today, we cannot help but think of the general situation of our country. Our China has the largest population in the world and occupies a very large area. According to the statistics of the Shen Bao Yearbook Society, our country's population is 421,307,785. Our country's area totals 11,173,558 square kilometers, accounting for about one-quarter of Asia and one-fifteenth of the world's land area, making it the largest country in Asia and the third largest country in the world. With such a large population and such a large area, why is our country still so weak and often subjected to imperialist aggression, unable to stand on an equal footing with other countries? The only reason is that our nation has not had much contact with foreign races, lacking observation, stimulation, and competition. Therefore, virtues such as unity, solidarity, hard work, struggle, worship of leaders, and promotion of martial prowess are not well developed in our country. Material civilization has no foundation, and national defense construction is even more out of the question. When the doors were opened and we encountered organized foreign aggression, we were at a loss and could not avoid the result of failure. Now, to consolidate our foundation, we should naturally work hard to cultivate healthy citizens. To thoroughly achieve our goal of national salvation, we must work hard to cultivate healthy children. Only with healthy children can we have healthy citizens, and only then can we have a healthy country. The cause of benevolence and orphans has such a significant relationship to the future of our country. From this, we can get a general idea. In the era of the Warring States, King Goujian of Yue was defeated by King Fucha of Wu. He used ten years of replenishment and ten years of training to finally defeat Fucha and avenge the great humiliation for the country. When we study European history, we can also find the same fact. In the 19th century, when Germany achieved victory over France through hard work and held a triumphant celebration, General Moltke said in his speech, "The crown of this victory should be placed on the heads of elementary school teachers." This is truly worth our attention. France was defeated by Germany and suffered great humiliation. The French people then resolved to avenge themselves. On the walls of elementary schools everywhere, they used vermilion ink to draw pictures of German aggression against France to cultivate the psychology of revenge in children. As a result, fifty years later, the World War broke out, and they defeated Germany, signed a treaty in the Palace of Versailles, and forced Germany to submit, washing away the shame of the Franco-Prussian War. We can know that everything depends on human effort. As long as we can now earnestly carry out the cause of benevolence and orphans and pay attention to the work of replenishment and training, the future of our China is still very bright. Promoting national prestige, perhaps in ten or twenty years, future history will tell us. Today is the day we hold the eighth annual meeting of this association. As president, I would like to present the importance of the cause of benevolence and orphans to encourage everyone together, hoping that there will be even greater development in the future. However, the knowledge and abilities of the colleagues of this association are limited. I am willing to receive criticism and guidance from all benevolent and orphan comrades and ask everyone present today not to hesitate to give us your corrections. That is what we are looking forward to very much. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Road Workers in the Public Concession Went on Strike Yesterday Morning to Protest Dismissals by Lottery</h3>
<p>Organized Petition Delegation to Appeal to the Ratepayers' Association, etc. Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing Agreed to Mediate</p>
<p>Da Gong She reported that after the Public Concession's Bureau of Works announced its plan to reduce road workers, all 1,200 road workers were panicked. They appealed to various parties but received no results. The Public Concession's Bureau of Works insisted on the established plan, convening all road workers at the Bureau of Works at 9 AM yesterday to draw lots to dismiss nine-tenths of them and planned to take back all road worker badges. The workers strongly protested and declared a joint strike starting at 7 AM, refusing to draw lots. As a result, all road construction work in the Public Concession was halted yesterday. The workers maintained order after the strike, and there were no disturbances.</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Agreed to Mediate: After all the road workers went on strike, each district selected 70 representatives to form a petition delegation. The petition delegation selected Li Jingchun, Liu Huanwen, Huan Buying, Cai Furong, Wang Shuangcai, and five others as full representatives. At around 1 PM, they set off with their petition, first going to the Citizen's Federation of the First Special District, where they were received by Chen Jiufeng. After inquiring about the situation, he accompanied them to He DeKui of the Bureau of Works, where they were received by He. He acknowledged that the workers' demands were legitimate and submitted them to the Director General for handling. They then went to the Sanbei Company to petition Chinese Director Yu Qiaqing, who personally received them and agreed to go to the Bureau of Works on Monday morning to negotiate and mediate and scheduled a definite response for 5 PM. The road workers expressed satisfaction and left. They then went to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to petition, where they were received by Secretary Yan E'sheng, who agreed to report to the chairman and protest to the Bureau of Works. They dispersed at around 3 PM.</p>
<p>To Petition the Party and Government Tomorrow: The Mutual Aid Association of Road Construction Workers believes that if the dismissal order is not rescinded, the livelihood of over a thousand workers will be in dire straits. To request that party and government agencies formally negotiate with the Bureau of Works, the association will send representatives tomorrow (Monday) at 10 AM to petition the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Municipal Government in separate groups, asking for assistance to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Listing Reasons to Request Negotiation: The petitioning road workers submitted a document yesterday to the Director General of the Bureau of Works, the Chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, and the Chinese Directors, requesting them to uphold justice and provide assistance. The original text reads: "Respectfully submitted: We, the road construction workers of the Public Concession, work like oxen and horses all day long, barely eking out a living with our sweat and blood. The hardship of our lives is truly unbearable. Now, the Bureau of Works, under the pretext of reducing government spending, is excluding Chinese workers and ordering the dismissal of all 1,200 road construction laborers by the end of this month. We, the ox-horse workers, are suddenly faced with the hardship of unemployment, and no less than 10,000 old and young who rely on us, directly and indirectly, will become hungry ghosts. Everyone is in a state of panic. Previously, all the road workers gathered to discuss and organize a mutual aid association, requesting the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of justice, and sent a letter to the Bureau of Works asking them to consider the difficult times and rescind the order. However, the Bureau of Works has not responded, and the deadline has arrived. We have no choice but to submit this petition to the Director General and the Directors, requesting you to thoroughly investigate and forward it to the Bureau of Works for reconsideration. For the issue of reducing government spending, please find other appropriate methods and rescind the dismissal order for Chinese workers. We respectfully list the reasons and facts below and request your inspection: ① The only reason for the Bureau of Works to dismiss Chinese workers is to reduce expenditures. In reality, the salaries of the 1,000-plus road construction workers are less than the bonuses of ten senior foreign staff members of the Bureau of Works. If the intention is truly to reduce expenditures, then the high salaries of senior foreign staff members should be reduced. To lay off over a thousand workers and increase social instability is not the right way. If this plan to dismiss Chinese workers succeeds, will there be no need to build or repair roads in the future? If so, then the entire Bureau of Works will no longer be necessary. Is this reasonable? ② In terms of road administration, the road lines are gradually extending, and the road surfaces are gradually widening. Due to the increase in vehicles, road maintenance work will inevitably be more complicated. It seems that the number of road construction workers should be increased. Why is there a dismissal? ③ We, the road construction workers, have served the Bureau of Works for over ten years. During the January 28th Incident, the work was intense. Workers were added and recruited, but no one came. All defensive works needed to be urgently arranged. We, the hired workers, could not retreat. Despite the great danger, we had to brave the gunfire and work day and night. Everyone requested an increase in wages. We, the road construction workers, have made contributions in the past and should be given a raise and a reward. Now, everyone is silent and keeps to themselves. Doing good deeds but receiving bad rewards is against reason and human nature and should not be allowed. ④ We have learned that the Bureau of Works plans to dismiss workers in order to reduce expenditures but intends to recruit workers temporarily. (Omission) This is actually a selfish proposal under the guise of reducing expenditures, using flowery words to deceive superiors. How could the Bureau of Works not see through this and be deceived? We, the Chinese workers who rely on sweat and blood to make a living, will all be put to death. In summary, the Bureau's policy of reducing spending and dismissing workers will not only fail to reduce expenditures but may actually increase them. Why bother with this unnecessary action that kills people and saves others? We hereby submit this petition in anguish, requesting you to have pity on the laborers, save the masses, avoid creating complications that hinder traffic, and bring peace to society. This would truly be a meritorious act."</p>

<h3>Those Who Impersonated Officials to Commit Fraud Convicted</h3>
<p>Ling Changsheng and Wang Qigui Each Sentenced to One Year and Two Months</p>
<p>Chen Xize, a Tianjin native residing at 52 Caishi Street in the French Concession, had previously escaped from Dalian due to a drug trafficking case. Upon returning to Shanghai at the end of last year, Sun, who used to be a guarantor at the residence of a certain celebrity, learned of this. On the evening of the 3rd of this month, he colluded with Ancha No. 681 of the French Concession Police, Constable Wang Qigui, and former Constable Ling Changsheng No. 155, to impersonate detectives and go to Chen's home under the pretext of investigating drugs. Chen happened to be out, and Chen's wife was lying on the bed. She was arrested. The landlord, surnamed Wang, tried to settle the matter with 100 yuan, paying 20 yuan first, with the balance to be paid the next day. When Ling and Wang went to collect the money, Chen reported them to the French Concession Police, who arrested Ling and Wang and handed them over to the Special Court for prosecution. The details of this case have been reported in this newspaper. Now, after the interrogation by Judge Sun Penghai, the judgment was made yesterday afternoon: Ling Changsheng and Wang Qigui are jointly convicted of the crime of intimidation and fraud and are each sentenced to one year and two months of imprisonment. The remaining charges are acquitted. During the appeal period, they will be transferred to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Tongyi Creditors' Group Urges Advance Payment</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Tongyi Trust Company went bankrupt, various creditors formed creditors' groups and filed lawsuits against the directors, supervisors, and directly responsible persons. Among them, the creditors' group organized by a group of Christian friends and women had the highest amount of claims and the largest number of members. The group hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao, Zhang Yifan, and Chen Changsheng, as well as accountant Ma Qichang, to sue all the directors and supervisors of the company for violating the Company Law and the Savings Bank Law. The Criminal Division of the Shanghai First Special District Court sentenced them to fines. Appeals to the Second Branch of the High Court were all rejected. All cases have now been finalized. The related civil lawsuit for over 250,000 yuan has been transferred to the Civil Division. The creditors' group believes that with the Lunar New Year approaching, the funds have not been received for a long time, and further research is needed on the coordination plan in the company's restructuring plan. Representatives and others held a meeting at the Dengshuo Mo Hotel yesterday afternoon, together with lawyers Zhang Yifan and Chen Changsheng and accountant Ma Qichang, to decide on the following points: ① Request the bankruptcy administrator to make an advance payment of 20% of all the company's current funds. ② Urge the bankruptcy administrator to actively pursue litigation against the savings and banking departments that have not yet been sued, as the directors and supervisors of the company were at fault. All banking departments and deposited government bonds should also be jointly and severally liable in accordance with the law, fully compensating the savings departments. ③ Before the supervisors take office, please allow the Shanghai First Special District Court to temporarily act as the supervisors and promptly sell off the company's movable property within the scope of the full rights and interests of the creditors in order to accumulate more current funds. ④ Request the court to seek effective remedial measures for the four aborted creditors' meetings. ⑤ In principle, agree to the coordinator's plan for Tongyi's restructuring, but the percentage of current funds to be returned differs too much. The lawyers and accountants should be requested to argue on the basis of reason, otherwise it cannot be accepted.</p>
<h3>The Reputation of Famous Calligrapher and Painter Yang Weiquan</h3>
<p>The modern famous writer Yang Weiquan has been studying calligraphy and painting for more than 30 years. He has a very deep understanding of the works of famous people in the Song and Yuan dynasties. He has also traveled to famous scenic spots everywhere, taking materials on the spot. He has seen a lot, and his mind is naturally rich. What he has seen is reflected in his pen. Every stroke is a wonderful idea. And his works such as "Ashes Heap" and "Old Word Basket" contain a myriad of images in one furnace, and each presents its own unique charm, which is comparable to the famous "Ashes Heap" of Qian Shunju in the Song Dynasty. People have long heard of his name overseas. A few years ago, one of Yang's masterpieces flowed into Taiwan, and a Japanese bought it for 1,200 gold. Last winter, Wang Zhengting asked him to paint four paintings as gifts to the American President Roosevelt. Roosevelt regarded them as treasures and they are now displayed in the National Museum of that country. Those who have seen them all praised them. Now there are imitators who often mix in counterfeit goods. Isn't this because the genuine article is so rare that people want to mix in counterfeits? Although there is a current price list, he never easily creates a work. He generally only makes one fan a day or one painting in half a month. Those in the world who want to obtain his paintings can contact 142 Huajinpailou in the city.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>In the "Local News" section of your newspaper on January 28th, there was a report about the Public Concession Police discovering a counterfeit banknote operation, which stated that a Polish man named Eric Changdamengu was arrested, etc. After investigation, this person is not of Polish nationality, and this embassy has no knowledge of his origins. I respectfully request a correction. Polish Embassy, January 29th</p>
<p>To the Editor, Having read a news item in the "Local News" section of your newspaper about a meeting of the executive committee of the Bar Association, in which there was the name of Barrister Bao Zhen among those applying for membership, it has been found that the character "Zhen" is a mistake for "Zheng."

<h3>Temple Bells</h3>
<p>— Shen Jiaqian</p>
<p>The overnight new snow settled quietly on the plum branches like velvet balls. A thin layer of ice formed on the stream, and occasionally a bubble floated up from the heart of the river, perhaps a huge-scaled fish wanting to peek out and search for food. But the fisherman in his raincoat still slept soundly in his thatched hut; he had drunk too much wine last night.</p>
<p>The empty mountain was so still. The bells from the temple on the mountain peak had stopped ringing for quite some time. The young monks were used to laziness. As soon as their master went down the mountain, they would boldly go down to drink a string of five hundred cash worth of white liquor and even buy half a pig's head to enrich their stomachs filled with vegetables and sweet potatoes. They did not understand the profound meaning of the scriptures, nor did they know from when they had to kneel on the futon and do such arduous work. The Tathagata was so solemn; his eyes seemed like two electric torches that could illuminate people's hearts and lungs. Looking at their master, however, he was sincerely focused on his nose with his eyes and on his heart with his nose, almost like a living bodhisattva. The incense in the large incense burner swirled around the plaque in the Hall of Great Strength, and a flower bloomed on the wick of the ever-burning lamp. Then, the young monks subconsciously struck the Great Compassion Bell hanging on the beam, letting the clear sound of the bell echo in the valley, harmonizing with their murmured recitations.</p>
<p>Time had destroyed the wind chimes on the eaves, and the ancient temple had declined from its prosperous days to a state of dwindling incense. Standing outside the mountain gate, gazing at the white clouds near the horizon, the village seemed to be as still as death at their feet. If not for the barking of wild dogs, this place would truly be close to the path to heaven. The young monks and the temple grew up together. They had learned more scriptures. In the evening, after finishing their evening lessons in the main hall, they silently followed behind their master, letting the candlesticks in their hands cast terrifying shadows on the corridor as they slowly walked towards the abbot's room.</p>
<p>The master never seemed to tire. He sat in the armchair covered with a tiger skin, solemnly and spiritedly telling stories of attaining enlightenment, asking them to be sincere and not to have wandering thoughts, and to take refuge in the Buddha Tathagata—the golden statue sitting on the lotus petals in the Hall of Great Strength, with eyes that could see into people's hearts and lungs. The young monks were temporarily stunned; their souls seemed to hover outside the gates of heaven, and at the same time, they felt a bright and dazzling golden light emanating from their heads, which could illuminate the movements of the lower world. The division between the two worlds awakened them from their fantasies. The master had already sat cross-legged, closed his eyes, and rested his mind; his straw sandals were pushed aside the armchair, and the night was deep.</p>
<p>Watching the swallows build nests under the eaves, now it was the snowy winter again. The brothers occasionally talked about the day they entered the temple, which they could no longer remember; they had almost grown up in this ancient temple and would die in this ancient temple, like their grandmaster, covered with two vats and buried in the bamboo forest behind the mountain, which was called nirvana—but they could not see heaven!</p>
<p>The sun climbed over the mountain peak, lazily shining on the red screen wall with the four characters "Amitabha Buddha." The ice in the stream had melted, and the plum branches seemed even thinner. It was late; tomorrow would probably be a sunny day.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sound of a wooden fish came from the mountain path. A traveling monk was walking towards the mountain peak. It was their master. He looked devoutly at the ground, perhaps chanting the Buddha's name. A Shen card was tied to his back, and a thin stick of incense was burning perpetually. The mountain path was like the path of life, rugged and winding. The new snow had melted into water, and water had seeped into his straw sandals, making walking even more difficult. But the old monk was not lazy at all, taking step by step, bowing deeply to the muddy road while chanting the Buddha's name. His steadfast faith would be maintained until his death.</p>
<p>The bells were echoing in the valley again, and the evening lessons in the incense-filled hall had begun again.</p>
<h3>The Clock</h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>The clock endures years of solitude, playing with musical beats. The sounds of the clock are so uneven, yet so even and pure.</p>
<p>The languid face of the clock is so pale, staring straight at people with idle eyes. People tired of working look up, and it fulfills its duty as if to say what time it is now; but it will never say whether the days pass so quickly or so slowly.</p>
<p>Although the diligent pendulum is locked in a closed room, it has a transparent window. Through this window, it can see the busy people. It is happy, always swaying back and forth. Occasionally, it steals a moment of rest, its body drooping helplessly, due to the owner's negligence in winding it up. The pendulum does not complain, nor is it greedy for the comfort of its companions. It endures years of solitude.</p>
<p>The gears imprisoned in the dark dungeon only emit slight groans, although their work is the most arduous. They do not even have a transparent window; they do not know the time and are always working tirelessly. They are content and do not harbor resentment, because their groans are slight.</p>
<p>The sounds of the clock are so uneven, but also so even and pure. The clock is a harmonious person.</p>
<h3>Deserted Village</h3>
<p>— Guan Yinxi</p>
<p>The weather had almost completely turned dark, and the rain fell incessantly and sadly.</p>
<p>The surrounding area was strangely chaotic and hazy. From the far, desolate village, there was no longer the occasional scent of rice and the frantic barking of village dogs. Those villages, once prosperous, were now withered and empty. Entire groups of young people abandoned their homes, wives, and daughters, fleeing to the forests and farther places for hunger and survival. The helpless, weak children and women either died, were sold off by merchants, or wandered into the cities. In the abandoned villages, there was no human voice or smoke from cooking fires. All that remained were some lost wild dogs, dragging their red tongues, drooping their tails, four thin legs supporting a shriveled belly, noses stretched out long, running around everywhere, sniffing. They lived by chewing on the corpses and bones of people. Slowly, the bones and corpses were all gone, and they began to kill each other, eating the corpses and bones of their own kind. When the corpses and bones of their own kind were also gnawed clean, they waited for death or fled to even farther places.</p>
<p>And so, for a long time in this disaster area, we could no longer hear the barking of dogs or the cries of people.</p>
<p>Along that stone-paved slope, I walked slowly, calculating the remaining unfinished journey in my mind. I felt that everything I was wearing and carrying was soaked through, and the cold struck me, making me shiver from time to time.</p>
<p>As I slowly climbed to the top of a not-very-high ridge, a dilapidated roadside pavilion stood abruptly before me. On it hung a plaque with faded paint. Looking at it in the dim light, I knew it was inscribed with the three characters "Seven Mile Pavilion." My destination was Luoyang, which was still about ten miles away from here. Looking at this weather, it was impossible to travel ten miles.</p>
<p>"I must find a place to rest, to rest..." I thought, and continued to move my feet. "Then, where to go?" I asked myself again. This is all deserted villages! "I couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p>
<p>After walking about a mile, the sky became even darker. I couldn't even see things ten steps away. I only felt myself gradually entering a cold section, surrounded by trees, shaking in the rain, gently swaying.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strand of light seeping out from the forest caught my attention. I cried out to myself in a trembling panic:</p>
<p>"There is hope! People live here!" So, I lifted my trembling feet and walked towards the light.</p>
<p>In front of an old, lonely tile-roofed house, I stood abruptly. Raindrops pattered on the roof tiles, making clear, rustling sounds. I could also hear the sound of my own pulse beating. This sound seemed to whisper softly in my ear:</p>
<p>"Knock on the door and go in? Can you be sure they are good people?..."</p>
<p>Finally, without any hesitation, I stepped forward and gently knocked on the iron ring on the wooden door. After about five or six minutes, I heard a series of staggering footsteps coming from inside.</p>
<p>The door opened slightly, and a thin, old man went back inside without even looking at me, murmuring sadly to himself, as if to himself, "You have taken everything, everything is gone..."</p>
<p>I was very perplexed. I thought about turning around and leaving regardless, but I didn't have that much courage. This sudden event was too strange. I couldn't just leave. I needed to see everything clearly. So, I followed him into the house, staggering.</p>
<p>In the small room, a bean oil lamp was flickering with its dim light, filling every broken and rotten corner. A corner of the floor was covered with a lot of straw, which was used as a bed. On the pile of straw lay a sleeping girl of thirteen or fourteen years old, but when I looked closely, I noticed that her mouth and nose were covered with bloodstains, and her eyes were slightly closed, with a white tinge.</p>
<p>The old man sat on a low stool, holding his head in his hands, bitterly mumbling to himself.</p>
<p>"I said: Old gentlemen, please be kind. This child is still young, and she is the only one I have... But, you dragged her away soon after, and I followed after them. I found her in a cave, but she was already dead, naked..."</p>
<p>I understood everything. I understood how this child had died, and what kind of person this old man took me for. I felt it was necessary to explain to him, but as I did so, he angrily raised his hand and shouted...</p>
<p>"Now I, I have nothing left!" His voice was so hoarse, and tears dripped down.</p>
<h3>A Great Scientific Invention: A Glass Heart Can Make Dead Flesh Live</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The famous American aviator Colonel Lindbergh, together with Dr. Carrel, a medical expert who previously won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, have recently invented an artificial glass heart, which has opened up undreamed-of possibilities in medical research. This glass heart can keep organs cut from animals or humans completely alive, thanks to Colonel Lindbergh's wisdom in achieving mechanical perfection.</p>
<p>Since scientists invented the method of extracting gland secretions, only a very small amount could be extracted from living animal organs, which was very expensive. Now, with the new invention that can artificially maintain the "life" of organs, large quantities can be extracted from organs. Insulin for treating diabetes and other therapeutic materials for many other difficult diseases can now be extracted quickly and cheaply using a glass heart that is shaped like a normal coffee filter.</p>
<p>Heart disease and adolescence problems may be solved in the future by studying how to maintain the viability of organs in chemical test conditions. This invention is a very interesting thing in the medical world.</p>
<p>Colonel Lindbergh once flew a plane to deliver an anti-pneumonia serum from the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research in New York to Baker, Canada, to save the dying aviator Bennett. He first met Dr. Carrel at this time. The doctor was very famous in the medical world. He had successfully kept a chicken heart beating in a chemical test laboratory using a nourishing medium, thus gaining great fame. In 1912, he took a heart from the abdomen of a dead but not yet cold chick, cut off a part of the heart, and put it in a glass tube. To this day, that heart is still beating. But the doctor hoped to go a step further, maintaining the complete life and health of organs, thereby producing gland secretions of immeasurable value. He had partially solved this problem, but his real desire was to create a mechanical heart. So the extremely intelligent Colonel Lindbergh came to be the doctor's research assistant.</p>
<p>The first aviator to fly across the Atlantic secretly worked at the Rockefeller Institute for five years, and then the world knew that he had changed from an aviator to a medical researcher. But the content of his research remained unknown. He worked hard for another two years before lifting the curtain and announcing his great success. It turned out that he had solved the entire problem that Dr. Carrel had not completely solved. His "glass coffee pot" can supply blood or blood substitutes to a living organ, just like a real heart. He used a compressed "artificial air" device to provide the repulsive force of the blood flow. This device must be sealed to prevent mold from invading, because in the past, Dr. Carrel's own experiments had been killed by mold.</p>
<p>This artificial glass heart, day after day, week after week, the blood circulates, so that the organs it nourishes do not show any signs of weakness or decay.</p>
<p>Now, human organs have been tested using the same method. This amazing new invention is opening up new horizons in medical research almost every day. The medical community believes that this glass heart has unlimited uses. One American medical giant said: "I dare say that no matter how much we exaggerate its function today, within a few years, we will feel that today's predictions are too cautious and subtle."</p>

<h3>Guochun Opens "Get Rich Quick"</h3>
<p>A hilarious comedy that will have you rolling in the aisles</p>
<p>Warner Bros. production, "Get Rich Quick" (Hor Money), is a hilarious comedy with a romantic and satirical undertone. Starring handsome actor Ross Alexander and beautiful actress Piff Lan Roberts, it tells the story of a chemist who turns cold water into gasoline and features a romance between a manager and his female secretary. From beginning to end, the jokes are stacked one after another, making people burst into laughter. It opens today at the Guotai Grand Theater.</p>
<h3>Literary Writers' Criticism of "Sunrise"</h3>
<p>For me, "Sunrise" feels closer than "Thunderstorm." In terms of subject matter, the author has moved from exposing the dark side of large families to attempting to uncover the baseness and depravity of society. - "Jin Yi"</p>
<p>...Speaking of "Thunderstorm," I must confess that it was thanks to it that I believed that China truly had a "modern drama" that could be staged on the most beautiful stage in Paris. Before that, although I had seen the scripts of two of the most outstanding playwrights, I always felt that they could not compare to the plays I had seen abroad, and I wanted to leave halfway through. Only "Thunderstorm" truly convinced me from the bottom of my heart. ...From the script, "Sunrise" has indeed given me great satisfaction, and I hope that in the near future, it can give me even greater satisfaction from the stage!</p>
<p>— (Li Lieven)</p>
<p>..."Sunrise" can be said to be a silhouette of urban society. From here, we see how people from all walks of life live, how they live in the decadent and extravagant life, how they die in the cruel and miserable life, how they are forced to die... The author uses his enthusiasm to completely depict those vivid scenes and vivid characters for us; undoubtedly, the author's talent, like that kind of majestic momentum, that kind of skilled technique, etc., appearing on the Chinese theater scene, can simply be said to be the first time.</p>
<p>— (Huang Mei)</p>
<p>...If "Thunderstorm" is a tragedy of fate, then we would like to say that "Sunrise" is closer to a social tragedy. If we dislike that "Thunderstorm" only shows us the ruins of feudal families, then we should admit that "Sunrise" shows us a large part of a festering society.</p>
<p>— (Li Rui)</p>
<p>I read "Thunderstorm" two years ago and "Sunrise" two months ago. Both plays deal with big issues, and both are written in extremely complex, intense, and meticulous ways. Both plays deeply moved me and made me admire Mr. Cao Yu's profound conception and magnificent writing skills.</p>
<p>— (Li Guangtian)</p>
<h3>Da Guangming Screens "Turning the Universe"</h3>
<p>Child star Kim Hye-soo's new masterpiece</p>
<p>Child star Kim Hye-soo's acting skills are truly second to none among many child stars in Hollywood. Friends who have seen her works will probably agree with this statement. Now, her new film "Can This Be Dixie?" is released today at Da Guangming. The film is co-starred by six famous actors including the lanky San Mao Zayer and two hundred beauties. There are three giant scenes in the film, which are magnificent, four famous songs, each of which is pleasant to listen to, and it is also hilarious and full of jokes. It is indeed a very interesting film and worth watching with the whole family.</p>
