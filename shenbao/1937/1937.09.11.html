<h3>敵軍總攻反遭重創我軍迎頭痛擊各路勝利</h3>
<p>虬江碼頭外一帶敵軍歛跡　閘北昨夜激戰敵不支敗退　我飛機大炮擊傷敵艦多艘</p>
<p>自敵軍在虬江碼頭登陸、連日向我引翔區·市中心·江灣等處進攻、同時又以新增援軍兩師團曁機械部之佈置完竣、於昨日展開主力戰爭浦江中砲戰、竟日不休、向我市中心及浦東等地猛攻、無的放矢徒耗彈藥、於我毫無損傷、而我軍砲隊、當亦立卽進攻、反予敵軍重創、浦江驅逐艦及運輸艦各一艘中彈重傷、倉皇逃逸、日領事署連中數彈、郵船碼頭及南潯路元芳路等處、玲遭擊中、損失殊大、虬江碼頭之敵、自被我迫退江邊後、士氣沮喪、昨雖在激烈砲火及飛機掩護之下、再圖反攻、找扼守軍工路之部隊、不但未動、且更向俞挺進，衝入敵艦炮火射程之下、殺敵無算、敵軍謀中路突破計劃、旣未得逞、友遭重大損傷、北四川路方面之敵、於晚間十時許、向我閘北陣地進犯、集中砲火與兵力於北站、同時虬江路方面亦發生激烈戰事、一時機關槍步搶及軍號之聲雜作、至十一時更形猛烈、我軍沉着應戰、迄午夜敵不支而退、進擊月浦及楊行之敵、被我擊退後、我軍仍扼守原陣地、敵軍企圖與雜店之敵打通、迄未得逞、浦江下游之敵艦、昨夜十時半向引翔鄕發砲、約半小時止、我軍陣地未有損害、查敵軍雖曾於昨日宣佈開始總攻、惟截止午夜、前線各路、雖均發生激戰、但來勢並不較前兩日更見兇猛、我各路陣地、屹然未動、固若金湯、</p>
<p>中央社南京十日軍、軍息、㊀九日楊行方面、敵以坦克車掩護第三師團之二聯隊、突破我第一线之陣地、經我黑夜反攻、將敵擊退、奪回原有陣地、敵戰軍八輛被我擊毀、㊁月浦方面、敵除以艦砲轟擊外、並以坦克車六輸、掩護步兵、向我陣地進犯、被我擊毀亂坦克車三輛、敵傷亡甚大、已退回原綫、㊂瀘方我某師敢死隊、擄獲敵戰車三輛、</p>
<h3>我軍乘勝進攻敵潰退虬江碼頭</h3>
<p>碼頭外一帶均無敵踪　我三面包圍必予殲滅</p>
<p>虬江碼頭附近一帶、前日激戰終日、我軍予敵重創、除擊斃敵聯隊長以下軍官多人、及敵兵四五百人外、並將敵軍壓迫退至軍工路以東一帶地段、旋於午夜、我軍復乘勝進擊、敵軍再度敗退、侷處虬江碼頭附近之沙灘、昨晨拂曉、我軍士兵在天色未明之際、曉風撲面、精神抖擻、雖經二十四小時不斷之血戰、然士氣之壯、得未曾有、卽乘敵軍喘息未停、疲乏不堪之時、繼續進攻、始則以來福槍及機關槍射擊、繼則以手溜彈向敵襲擊、最後紛上刺刀、衝鋒肉搏、激戰至午刻、敵軍披靡、遺屍遍地、爭先逃入虬江碼頭之內、藉堅固之建筑物為防禦、負嵎頑抗、我軍即將虬江碼頭三面包圍、碼頭之外附近一帶地段、均無敵踪、迄昨晚止、我軍尚在圍攻之中、</p>
<h3>月浦激戰敵受重創</h3>
<p>月浦之線、九日晚發生極猛烈之戰、敵以主力進攻、坦克車十餘輛、在轟前線活動、步兵從後跟進、同時江中敵艦、以連綫不息之重砲、向我陣地轟擊、敵機亦在上空活動、砲彈炸彈、密下如雨、我守軍沉着應戰、以迫擊砲瞄準敵車、猛烈轟擊、將其燬壞多輛、敵遂被迫從退、我軍堅守原有陣地屹然不動、敵軍死亡、不計其數、我守軍之傷亡者、約計百餘人、</p>
<p>中央社云、月浦附近之敵、係敵方之有力部隊、九日停泊江面之敵艦、集中砲火、向我月浦陣地轟擊、同時敵機亦飛翔上空轟炸、敵軍即在飛機及砲火掩護之下、以坦克車為前導、向我猛犯、我軍奮男迎擊、劇戰整日、入晚、戰况尤為激烈、迄昨晨止、敵軍始張未能得逞、是役我軍傷亡百餘人、而敵軍死傷之數、尤倍於我云、</p>
<h3>寶山之敵被我重圍</h3>
<p>寶山方面之敵、屢次進犯、均未得逞、昨晨三時、又有敵軍一部約三數百人、藉砲火之掩護、由王家宅方面向我進襲、我嚴守原有陣地、沉着應戰、不為所動、同時並調派大軍向左右抄襲、敵軍不備、已被我嚴密包圍、刻尚在頑强困鬥中、</p>
<h3>羅店我收復吳家宅</h3>
<p>羅店方面、我軍前日收復長橋及封家宅等一帶要地後、敵軍向我軍反攻甚烈、</p>
<h3>敵犯楊行不支潰退</h3>
<p>兩軍現憑泗塘河對峙</p>
<p>吳淞敵軍昨晨以坦克車掩護步隊、衝鋒突破找一自堂陣地、且來勢兇猛、曾被衝至淞楊路居邨、（即司法院長居正住宅）相距楊行鎭公一里許、致附近各村落、一時均遭波及、我後防駐軍、接得警報、立即增援、向敵包抄、奮力迎擊、敵軍被困、遂倉皇退却、死傷甚多、我軍亦有相當犧牲、交戰結果兩軍憑泗塘河對峙、該河卽淞寶交界綫、並悉寶山方面戰事、我軍已逼近城廂西門、敵見勢弱、卽改攻為守、不肯衝鋒、現我軍並未停息、仍在進擊中、</p>
<p>據確報、前晚寶山方面之敵、突以全力、由三官堂·吳家宅·分兩路向我楊行東北向陣地進攻、該處我方駐有重兵、遭遇後遂發生激戰、我軍奮勇前進、機槍與手溜彈、同時並發、血戰數小時、結果敵以傷亡過慘重、不支潰退、我軍亦稍有損失、但陣地仍極鞏固、</p>
<p>在吳家宅小金塘等處、兩軍發生劇烈之戰門、我軍前仆後繼、以手溜彈等沖鋒進擊、將敵軍坦克車兩輛擊毀、敵傷亡過衆、遂向後退、我軍當挺進將吳宅等處完全收復、</p>
<p>又悉、羅店方面之敵、係敵方之主力部隊、前晚數度向我猛犯、我軍沉着應戰、俟敵逼近、即以密集之機槍掃射、敵軍傷亡奇重、迄未得逞、</p>
<h3>我機夜襲擊中敵艦</h3>
<p>我空軍前夜九時四十五分及十一時二十分、兩度出動來瀘、轟炸敵軍楊樹浦一帶陣地、因沿黃浦江而來、敵未覺察、迨我機飛臨日本郵船會社碼頭上空、投下數彈、着地爆炸後、敵艦始食皇以高射砲亂轟、而我機已女然離去、續行東飛至楊樹浦底裕豐紗廠敵軍根據地、投下重量炸彈數枚、均命中目標、敵頗受損傷、又據軍事機關報告、敵運輸艦一艘、被我擊中尾部、損失甚重、並有數彈落於敵出雲旗艦左近、浦江中浪花高濺、震動全艦、敵軍恐慌異常云、我空軍於聆日午夜飛滬襲擊敵艦、敵艦倉皇以高射砲及高射機槍亂射、我空軍勇敢異常、在敵艦砲火之中、從容投擲炸彈四枚、其中一枚擊中敵艦一艘、爆炸之聲、響澈雲霄、高射砲及高射機槍之聲、隨之靜寇片刻、旋我機飛繞滬西一週、零點二十分、再度飛臨浦江上空、但未投彈、即行飛往楊樹浦一帶敵軍陣地轟炸、至零時四十分，我機又折回浦江上空、敵艦又以高射炮及高射機槍亂射，我機繫旋一週、投擲炸彈三枚、均告中的、至敵方損害情形、尚未查明、我機旋即安然離滬而返、</p>
<p>昨日淸晨六時許、敵機二架、又在南市高昌廟沿江一帶、投擲巨彈二枚、轟然巨聲、當被炸燬民房十數幢、幸未傷人、未幾、又有二架、不斷飛往偵察、至午始息、距至午後零時三十分許、又有二架、飛往大南門、陸家浜、西門等處作低度飛行、似擬投彈狀、如是歷一小時許始返、又下午二時三十分許敵機二架、在滬西極司非而路浜北上空、盤旋數匝後、用機槍掃射當有鄕民張水根及鄕童阿二、被流彈擊傷頭部甚重、旋經人扛抬至浜南、未幾卽行斃命、下午四時三十分左右、有敵飛機兩架、飛翔於閘北上空偵察找陣地、並施放機關槍掃射、歷時約二十分鐘、惟並未投彈、後經我軍用高射砲及高射機關槍轟擊、敵機卽倉皇逃去、</p>
<h3>敵機竟日四出偵察</h3>
<p>敵陸軍飛機來滬增援後、昨又四出活動、分至浦東及市中心區一帶轟炸、其在浦東方面者、投彈尤多、企圖炸毀找軍工事及砲兵陣地、血於浦江砲戰時、尤其旋不斷投彈、惟我頂作戒備、故未被命中、僅附近村落多處民房全毀、損傷奇重、至市中心區方面、其目標在我軍機關槍掩體、當轟炸時、敵艦亦開砲助擊、但彈多處發、我損失甚少、</p>
<h3>敵誣我施用病菌彈</h3>
<p>中央社云、敵軍有患虎列拉病者、甚發言人竟向西籍記者發表、誣指係我軍旋用病菌砲彈所致、該記者於我當局招待新聞記者席上、提出詢問、我發言人當予切實之否認、並謂我人素重這德、決不出此非人道之舉動云、</p>
<h3>侵滬不及一月敵軍傷亡一萬餘</h3>
<p>內敵軍海陸軍官長甚衆</p>
<p>自滬戰爆發以來、敵軍不惜傾全國精銳部隊、來滬侵凌、迭經我忠勇將士痛擊、時僅匝月、敵軍已傷亡極重、速戰速決之夢、完全打破、茲將可靠方面所得自八月十三日起至本月七日止、敵軍傷亡詳細調查報告如下、海軍方面傷亡已確實查明者、計第三艦隊司令部參謀少佐松原明夫、副官兼參謀少佐中村馨、軍醫長大佐田代正治、出雲旗艦砲術長少佐近籐三郎、機關槍長少佐山崎義、航海長副指揮扇道雄、第十一戰隊司令部先任參謀少佐岡田為次、砲衝指揮官少佐有譯直定、各艦隊計有對馬艦副艦長尾田道雄主計長少尉松尾格、勢多艦艦長中佐六條深思（該艦令毀）、參謀少佐保田繁吉、隅田艦隊隊長少佐阿部俊雄、砲術中尉內山靜、堅田艦軍醫少浙鍊細正一、保津艦主計長少佐富津丕參、伏見艦砲術長大尉山普軍治、特別陸戰隊副官兼參謀少佐柴北明’參謀少佐安田義達、第十六驅逐艦隊刈萱艦砲術長中尉中川男等、及死亡海軍陸戰隊士兵三千八百餘人、陸軍方面傷亡已確實查明者、計旅團長倉永、久留米第十二師團第十二旅團參謀少佐森德源吾、團附三好明原副官少尉安川治、機關槍長中尉小關成、軍醫長少尉中村恒、第九師團第十八旅團主計長伊籐四郎、副官大島繁吉、第六師團副官丸安得心、砲術長少尉堀田勇志、機關槍長少尉板倉五郎等及土兵約一萬零數百人、</p>
<p>敵連日在各綫猛烈進攻、冀遂其速戰速次之企圖、惟隨處均遭遇動强之反擊、迄無進展、反受重創、敵有傷兵救護艦兩艦、停泊於日領事館前、各綫傷兵、均運往醫治、昨日上午八時至下午一時間、有卡車數十輛、起運傷兵、異常忙碌、亘五小時之久、可見敵軍受創之重云、</p>
<p>昨晨七時三十五分、駛滬泊駐三菱碼頭之敵紅十字輸Kinugasa號、於卸下大批救護藥品後、卽有敵傷兵及死屍焚燒後之屍灰甚夥、運送上輪、該輪旋於昨日下午一時三十分、駛出淞口返日云、</p>
<h3>中央執監委會對抗戰先烈致敬</h3>

<h3>浦江昨又發生兩度劇烈砲戰</h3>
<p>敵企圖在陸家嘴登岸被我擊退　驅逐運輸兩艦均被我擊傷逃逸　敵陣地多處及總領署着彈甚多</p>
<p>確息昨日下午四時半至六時間之浦東中二次砲戰我浦東方面砲隊、亦發重砲還擊、彈無虛發射擊奇準、日領事館共中五砲、燬壞極大、當第五彈擊中時、該館立卽起火、惟旋卽灌救熄滅、又當時在浦中作戰之敵廿一驅逐隊之驅逐艦一艘艦面被我射中數彈、該艦烟囟及砲塔、均遭燬壞、惜機部未壞、仍向下游逸去、</p>
<p>昨日上午十一時半、停泊於浦中之敵擊、突向我浦東方面砲擊、我浦東方面之砲兵陣地、立即予以還擊、砲火甚密、十一時四十分左右、我軍擊中日本郵船會社碼頭附近兩砲敵方受損頗鉅、敵機兩隊、飛至浦東砥空窺察、企圖襲擊我砲位、盤旋甚久、毫無所得、浦中敵艦仍繼續向我砲擊、尤以停泊于日本郵船會社碼頭之敵卅號砲艦發砲為最多、迄午後一時廿分始止、旋於午後四時四十分、敵艦再度砲擊我浦東、我砲兵亦卽以重砲還擊、</p>
<p>敵驅逐艦尾部中砲</p>
<p>五時許、有敵二十一號驅逐艦一艘、由淞口駛入浦江助戰、市抵招商局北棧江面、卽被我擊中一砲，尾部受傷甚重、急行掉頭向下游逃逸、時第二個砲彈又接踵而至、相距丈餘、不幸未中、嗣有敵機爾架、飛至浦東上空偵察、我方砲聲寂然、敵機毫無所得而去、我砲兵陣地又繼續發砲、敵司令艦出雲號、及停泊於一號浮筒之驅逐艦、四號浮筒之砲艦、曁停泊於日本郵船會社碼頭之三十號砲艦與運輸艦一艘、亦集中砲火、向我浦東猛攻、發砲之密、宛如連珠、</p>
<p>敵謀登陸被我擊退</p>
<p>五時二十分許、敵軍分乘小艇數艘、卽在砲火掩護之下、企圖由陸家嘴上岸、被我以密集之機槍擊退、是時砲戰猶在繼續之中、砲聲隆隆、聲震全市、惟敵艦砲擊、以漫無標的、除浦東民房多處被毀外、我軍並無損失、而我方之砲擊、則標的異常準確、日本郵船會社碼頭、大阪碼頭、及黃浦碼頭、被我擊中多砲、敵方損失奇重、黃浦路之日本總領署及南潯路元芳路等處之敵軍陣地、著彈亦多、元芳路曾起大火、延燒甚烈、</p>
<p>敵運輸艦亦遭擊中</p>
<p>五時三十分停泊於郵船會社碼頭之敵運輸艦一艘、亦被我擊中一砲、倉事啟椗向浦江下游逃逸、出雲旗艦之附近，曾落三彈、惜未命中、直至晚間七時半、砲聲始漸稀少、綜計敵方發砲多至二百餘響、而我方則僅發五十餘砲云、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>堅定抗戰決心</h3>
<p>— 慶</p>
<p>滬戰發生已近匝月。敵人方面陣績增援。其所動員之陸軍。竟達八個師團。參戰飛機亦在二百架以上。但因我陸空軍奮勇抗戰之結果。敵人迄猶困處於沿江沿海之狹長陣線。僅恃兵艦火力作策援。上岸之孤立部隊。得免全殲。此數日間。其犀利之武器。密集之火力。旣不能動搖我軍堅固之陣綫。而歷次衝鋒之失利。且使其作戰實力受極大之打擊就軍事言。我國蓋已處於絕對優勢矣。</p>
<p>至就政治言之。我國上下一心。羣策羣力。全國精誠團結之現象。為空前所未有。政府戰時令融政策與經濟動員辦法。獲得人民一致擁護。實施以後。金融安定。市面平穩。資金外流之現象。得以杜塞。物價高漲之危機。得以抑制。操縱居奇之惡風。頓時歛跡。而民食問題。亦遂得調劑。人民處此危難期間。更不避艱險。積極從事於慰勞救護及鞏固後方之工作。雖敵機到處肆虐。平民慘遭犧牲。但民衆於悲憤之餘。益堅抗敵之決心。社會秩序。井然不亂。此種精神。非僅顯示我國抗戰之勝利。有必然的把握。抑且足以威天地而泣鬼神也。</p>
<p>雖然。在此抗戰期間。仍有不少人士。因對目前抗戰形勢。認識不足。有意無意間。發生悲觀之心理。於是談及國際關係。輒從表面著眼。以為遠東有關之列強。對於侵略國必不能作有效之制裁。談及軍事。輒專就武器作估量。以為政敵軍猛烈砲火之下。我軍勢難持久作戰。此種似是而非之見解。雖似出於關懷國是之熱忱。但其影響所及。實足以動搖人心。而糊糊抗戰必勝之意識也。</p>
<p>不但如此。此種悲觀心理之發展。甚且有助於敵人。有害於抗戰。蓋吾國今次之抗戰。乃持久的全民族的抗戰。而敵人所抱之企圖則在速戰速決。使戰事成為局部化。今者我全國最優秀之軍事人才旣集中全力。作軍事上遠大之策劃。凡吾國民唯有予以絕對之信任。始克求得最後之勝利。設因一時一地軍事之小小挫折。遽抱悲觀之見解。則怯敵心理於以形成。漢奸謠言乘機敵播適中敵人之詭計矣。</p>
<p>吾人須知。今日為爭取民族生存之緊要關頭。凡具有天良之國民均不應自外於抗戰之陣線。而撲除悲觀心理。擊定抗戰決心。實為保證最後勝利之先次絛件。深願負民衆組織及民衆訓練之責者。對此加以注意焉。</p>
<h3>我軍英勇挫敵英美法輿論一致讚美</h3>
<p>向抱懷疑態度者亦當刮目相看　日雖不即崩潰世界禍害已減輕</p>
<p>［倫敦］泰晤士報今日評論中國境內戰事、略謂日本至早欲於深秋以前、在任何陣錢、獲一判定勝負之決戰、實屬難能。卽欲獲可自動終止戰局之任何決戰、亦不可能、此種觀念、日本自已亦其之矣、新聞記事報社論、謂中國軍隊在上海奮勇抗戰、舉世人士、咸表同情、從來兩國戰爭、其中一國能得中立國人如此極大同情如今日之中國者、殆未前有、英國向有若干人遇事輒為日本辯護、今亦寂然、卽近與東京簽定防共協定之德國對於中日戰爭、亦復冷淡處之、中國之戰略、在就可能範圍內、極力阻止日軍之深進、庶日本巳呈裂痕之經濟、可因此戰爭而臻於崩潰、總之戰事延長愈久、則日本愈不能爲整個世界之威協矣云、中央社十日路透電）</p>
<p>［紐約］紐約時報今日論遠東時局、略謂、觀於中國目前全國一心一德之抗日𤍠誠、足見中國已臻於統一之域、向以懷疑態度視中國者、今當刮目相看矣、該報又謂、日本今次對華作戰之目的、卽作於短期間內戰勝中國、唯中國之戰略、必在延長對日之抵抗、務使日本之經濟機構、趨於崩潰、隨而不能繼續對華侵略而後止、至少亦將使日本不能對華提出苛刻要求、就今日中國對日抗戰之壯烈與意志之堅決而觀、中國所遭經濟上之困難雖大、最後之勝利、當可到達也、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］紐約論壇報盛稱中國軍士勇武抗戰成續、震驚中外、並引“一二八”及此次滬戰爲例、略謂中國軍士在日本最犀利武器威脅之下、始終未退、實力具存、殊堪欽敬、中國軍士乃爲主義而戰、故覺銳不可當等語、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>［日內瓦］此間國際報發表法國駐國聯會永久代表彭古所撰一文、題爲“中國戰事之展望”略謂、日本以保謹國境、消滅危險的宣傳等理由、對華不宣而戰、誰爲侵略者、已極明顧、惟列強態度、尚屬模稜、誠然、國聯會因不能阻意併呑阿比西尼亞於前、復不能消除西班牙內戰於後、而陷於軟弱無能、但目前之無力應付中國戰事、九國公約簽字國所採消極政策、實難辭其咎、此不僅危害歐亞兩洲之均勢、目可爲第一世界大戰之導火綫、列強僅保護其𣃮滬僑民利益、尚嫌不足、至於採用調和侵略者與被侵略者之政策、則屬僞善之圖、上次英內閣會議、會議決對中日“糾紛出任調停、以求解決、斯誠駭人聽聞者也、一九三二年、國聯會僅以一紙之宣言、則能阻止限制與和緩日本之佔據中國領土、吾人承認根據田中之計劃、日本所需者、不僅併呑亞洲、且欲佔領全歐、西方列強與美國已受警告矣、惟目前最使人無疑者、乃中國依賴自己之強大軍隊、保護其自由與獨立也云、（十日中央社電）</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>昨日國聯行政院開革九十八屆常會，我政府正式向國聯伸訴。日本迭次侵略我國疆土。擾亂東亞和平。而一般主張國聯無用論者。以為國聯機構之無能。與不健全。早為世界所共曉。此種伸訴。箏於問卜求神。絕不發生任何效力。不知此次伸訴國聯。原無求助國聯之意。無非欲昭示大義而張天討於世界也。一則我國本為國聯會員國此次國聯開會自應有通知各會員國之義務二則此次對日搞戰。事實上原是自力自術。並不求助於人。而於公道上。應有購世界各國周知的必要則。各國對于侵略國。雖無法作事實上之制裁。而必定能得良心上之裁判也。</p>

<h3>Enemy's General Offensive Suffers Heavy Losses, Our Army Delivers a Head-on Blow, Victories on All Fronts</h3>
<p>Enemy Troops Linger Outside the Qiujiang Wharf Area / Fierce Fighting in Zhabei Last Night, Enemy Unsupportable and Retreats / Our Planes and Artillery Damage Several Enemy Warships</p>
<p>Since the enemy troops landed at Qiujiang Wharf and launched attacks on our Yinxiang District, downtown area, Jiangwan and other locations for several days, and at the same time, with the deployment of two newly reinforced divisions and mechanical units completed, they launched a major war yesterday with artillery battles in the Huangpu River, which continued all day. They fiercely attacked our downtown area and Pudong and other places, wasting ammunition aimlessly and causing no damage to us. Our artillery units also immediately launched attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. One destroyer and one transport ship of the enemy in the Huangpu River were seriously damaged by artillery fire and fled in panic. The Japanese Consulate was hit by several shells, and the post office wharf, Nanxun Road, Yuanfang Road, and other places were also hit, resulting in significant losses. The enemy at Qiujiang Wharf, after being forced back to the riverside by us, had their morale dampened. Although they attempted a counter-attack again yesterday under the cover of fierce artillery fire and aircraft, the troops guarding the Jungong Road not only did not move but even advanced further, charging into the firing range of the enemy warships and killing countless enemies. The enemy's plan to break through the central route failed and they suffered significant losses. The enemy on the North Sichuan Road side launched an attack on our Zhabei positions at about 10 o'clock in the evening, concentrating artillery fire and troops on the North Station. At the same time, fierce fighting also occurred on the Qiujiang Road side. For a time, the sounds of machine guns, rifles, and military bugles were mixed together, becoming even more intense at 11 o'clock. Our army calmly responded to the battle, and the enemy retreated unsupported until midnight. The enemy attacking Yuepu and Yangxing were repelled by us, and our army still guarded the original positions. The enemy's attempt to connect with the enemy in Zadian has not succeeded so far. The enemy warships in the lower reaches of the Huangpu River fired at Yinxiang Township at 10:30 last night, ceasing after about half an hour. There was no damage to our army's positions. It was found that although the enemy had announced the start of a general offensive yesterday, as of midnight, fierce fighting had occurred on all fronts, but the momentum was no more fierce than the previous two days. Our positions on all fronts remained unshaken and impregnable.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th Military News: ❶ On the 9th, in the Yangxing area, the enemy, under the cover of tanks, broke through our first line of defense with the 2nd Regiment of the 3rd Division. After our night counterattack, the enemy was repelled and the original position was recaptured. Eight enemy tanks were destroyed by us. ❷ In the Yuepu area, in addition to bombardment by naval guns, the enemy also used six tanks to cover infantry and attacked our positions. Three enemy tanks were destroyed by us, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and has retreated to the original line. ❸ In the Shanghai area, a daredevil team of one of our divisions captured three enemy tanks.</p>
<h3>Our Army Takes Advantage of the Victory to Attack, Enemy Retreats from Qiujiang Wharf</h3>
<p>No Enemy Traces in the Area Outside the Wharf / We Encircle on Three Sides and Will Annihilate Them</p>
<p>In the vicinity of Qiujiang Wharf, fierce fighting continued all day the day before yesterday. Our army inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In addition to killing many enemy officers below the rank of regimental commander and four or five hundred enemy soldiers, we also forced the enemy to retreat to the area east of Jungong Road. Then, at midnight, our army took advantage of the victory and launched another attack. The enemy retreated again and entrenched themselves on the beach near Qiujiang Wharf. At dawn yesterday morning, our soldiers, with the cool breeze blowing on their faces, were full of spirit in the dim light. Although they had experienced 24 hours of continuous bloody battles, their morale was unprecedentedly high. Taking advantage of the enemy's inability to catch their breath and their exhaustion, they continued to attack. First, they used rifles and machine guns to fire, then they attacked the enemy with hand grenades, and finally, they fixed bayonets and charged in hand-to-hand combat. After fierce fighting until noon, the enemy was defeated, leaving corpses everywhere, and scrambled to escape into Qiujiang Wharf, using the solid buildings as a defense, stubbornly resisting. Our army immediately surrounded Qiujiang Wharf on three sides, and there were no enemy traces in the area outside the wharf. As of last night, our army was still besieging the wharf.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Yuepu, Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>On the Yuepu line, an extremely fierce battle occurred on the evening of the 9th. The enemy launched a major attack, with more than ten tanks operating in front of the line, and infantry following behind. At the same time, enemy warships in the river bombarded our positions with continuous heavy artillery fire, and enemy aircraft also operated in the air. Shells and bombs rained down densely. Our defending troops calmly responded to the battle, aiming at enemy vehicles with mortars and bombarding them fiercely, destroying many of them. The enemy was then forced to retreat. Our army firmly held its original position and remained unmoved. The number of enemy deaths was countless, and the casualties among our defending troops were estimated to be about a hundred.</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the enemy near Yuepu were powerful enemy units. On the 9th, enemy warships anchored in the river concentrated artillery fire and bombarded our Yuepu positions. At the same time, enemy aircraft also flew over the area and bombed it. The enemy troops, under the cover of aircraft and artillery fire, used tanks as the vanguard and attacked us fiercely. Our army bravely met the attack, and the fierce battle lasted all day. By night, the battle situation was even more intense. As of yesterday morning, the enemy had failed to achieve their aims. In this battle, our army suffered more than a hundred casualties, and the number of enemy deaths and injuries was even greater than ours.</p>
<h3>Enemy in Baoshan Heavily Besieged by Us</h3>
<p>The enemy in Baoshan has repeatedly attacked but failed. At 3:00 yesterday morning, another group of enemy troops, about three to four hundred, under the cover of artillery fire, attacked us from the direction of Wangjiazhai. We strictly guarded our original positions, calmly responded to the battle, and remained unmoved. At the same time, we also dispatched large forces to flank from the left and right. The enemy was unprepared and has been tightly surrounded by us. They are still stubbornly fighting in a desperate situation.</p>
<h3>We Recapture Wujiazhai in Luodian</h3>
<p>In the Luodian area, after our army recaptured important areas such as Changqiao and Fengjiazhai the day before yesterday, the enemy launched a fierce counterattack against our army.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks Yangxing, Unsupportable and Retreats</h3>
<p>The Two Armies Now Confront Each Other Across the Sitang River</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the enemy troops in Wusong, under the cover of tanks, launched an assault to break through our Zhitang position. The attack was fierce and reached the Jucun Village on Songyang Road (the residence of Ju Zheng, President of the Judicial Yuan), about one mile from the Yangxing Township Government, causing temporary impact to nearby villages. Our rear defense troops, upon receiving the alarm, immediately reinforced and encircled the enemy, fighting bravely. The trapped enemy troops then retreated in panic, suffering many casualties. Our army also suffered considerable sacrifices. As a result of the battle, the two armies confronted each other across the Sitang River, which is the boundary line between Songjiang and Baoshan. It was also learned that in the battle of Baoshan, our army had approached the West Gate of the city. Seeing the situation weakening, the enemy changed from attack to defense, unwilling to charge. Our army has not stopped and is still attacking.</p>
<p>According to reliable reports, the enemy in Baoshan suddenly launched a full-scale attack from Sanguantang and Wujiazhai on the evening before last, attacking our northeastern positions in Yangxing in two routes. Our side was stationed with heavy troops in that area. After the encounter, fierce fighting broke out. Our army advanced bravely, firing machine guns and hand grenades at the same time. After several hours of bloody battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated in disarray. Our army also suffered some losses, but the positions remained extremely solid.</p>
<p>In Wujiazhai, Xiaojintang, and other places, fierce battles took place between the two armies. Our army advanced wave after wave, charging with hand grenades and other weapons, destroying two enemy tanks. The enemy suffered too many casualties and retreated backward. Our army then advanced and completely recovered Wujiazhai and other places.</p>
<p>It was also learned that the enemy in the Luodian area were the enemy's main force. On the evening before last, they launched several fierce attacks on us. Our army calmly responded to the battle, waiting for the enemy to approach before firing with dense machine guns. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties and failed to achieve their aims.</p>
<h3>Our Aircraft Night Raid Hits Enemy Warship</h3>
<p>Our air force dispatched planes twice to Shanghai on the night before last at 9:45 PM and 11:20 PM to bomb the enemy's positions in the Yangshupu area. Because they came along the Huangpu River, the enemy did not notice them. When our planes flew over the pier of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company and dropped several bombs, which exploded on the ground, the enemy warships began to frantically fire anti-aircraft guns, but our planes had already left. Continuing to fly east to the enemy's base at the Yufeng Yarn Factory at the end of Yangshupu, they dropped several heavy bombs, all of which hit their targets, and the enemy suffered considerable damage. According to a report from a military agency, an enemy transport ship was hit in the stern by us and suffered heavy losses, and several shells landed near the enemy flagship Izumo, causing high waves in the Huangpu River, shaking the entire ship, and causing extreme panic among the enemy troops. Our air force flew to Shanghai at midnight to attack enemy warships. The enemy warships hastily fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns. Our air force was extremely brave, and in the midst of the enemy warship's fire, calmly dropped four bombs, one of which hit an enemy warship. The sound of the explosion reverberated through the clouds, and the sound of anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns stopped for a moment. Then our planes flew around western Shanghai for a week, and at 0:20 AM, flew over the Huangpu River again, but did not drop bombs, and instead flew to the enemy's positions in the Yangshupu area to bomb them. At 0:40 AM, our planes turned back over the Huangpu River again. The enemy warships again fired anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns. Our planes circled for a week and dropped three bombs, all of which hit their targets. The extent of the enemy's damage has not yet been determined. Our planes then safely left Shanghai and returned.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at around 6:00 AM, two enemy planes dropped two large bombs in the area along the river near Gaochang Temple in the South City, causing a deafening noise. Dozens of civilian houses were destroyed, fortunately without injuring anyone. Soon after, two more planes continued to fly around to scout, ceasing only at noon. Around 0:30 PM, two more planes flew at low altitude over the Great South Gate, Lujiabang, West Gate, and other places, seemingly intending to drop bombs, continuing for about an hour before returning. Around 2:30 PM, two enemy planes circled several times over the area north of the Jisifei Road in western Shanghai, and then strafed with machine guns. Two local villagers, Zhang Shuigen and the child A'er, were seriously wounded in the head by stray bullets. They were carried to the south of the street and soon died. Around 4:30 PM, two enemy planes flew over Zhabei to scout for our positions and strafed with machine guns, lasting for about twenty minutes, but did not drop bombs. Then our army used anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns to bombard the enemy planes, and the enemy planes fled in panic.</p>
<h3>Enemy Planes Reconnoitered Everywhere All Day</h3>
<p>After the enemy army's planes came to Shanghai for reinforcement, they were active again yesterday, going to the Pudong and downtown areas to bomb. Those in the Pudong area dropped even more bombs, attempting to destroy our army's fortifications and artillery positions. Especially during the artillery battle in the Huangpu River, they continuously dropped bombs, but we had taken precautions, so they did not hit their targets. Only many civilian houses in nearby villages were completely destroyed, resulting in extremely heavy damage. In the downtown area, their target was our army's machine gun shelters. When they bombed, the enemy warships also opened fire to assist, but the shells mostly landed in the wrong places, and our losses were minimal.</p>
<h3>Enemy Falsely Accuses Us of Using Germ Bombs</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, some enemy soldiers have contracted cholera. Their spokesperson even told Western journalists that this was caused by our army using germ bombs. The journalist asked about this at a press conference held by our authorities, and our spokesperson firmly denied it, saying that we have always valued morality and would never resort to such inhumane acts.</p>
<h3>In Less Than a Month of Invasion, Enemy Army Suffers Over 10,000 Casualties</h3>
<p>Including Many Enemy Navy and Army Officers</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the enemy army has spared no effort to send elite troops from across the country to invade Shanghai. After repeated heavy blows by our loyal and courageous soldiers, in only a month, the enemy army has suffered extremely heavy casualties, and their dream of a quick victory has been completely shattered. The following is a detailed investigation report of enemy army casualties from August 13th to the 7th of this month, obtained from reliable sources. The confirmed casualties on the naval side include: Staff Major Matsubara Akio of the 3rd Fleet Headquarters, Adjutant and Staff Major Nakamura Kaoru, Chief Medical Officer Colonel Tashiro Masaji, Artillery Chief Major Kondo Saburo of the Izumo flagship, Machine Gun Chief Major Yamazaki Yoshi, Navigation Chief and Deputy Commander Ogido Yu, Senior Staff Major Okada Tameji of the 11th Squadron Headquarters, Artillery Commander Major Ariyoshi Naosada, and from various fleets: Vice-Captain Oda Michio and Paymaster Ensign Matsuo Kaku of the Tsushima warship, Captain Lieutenant Commander Rokujo Shinkyo of the Seta warship (which was destroyed), Staff Major Yasuda Shigekichi, Commander Major Abe Toshio of the Sumida Fleet, Artillery Lieutenant Uchiyama Shizuka, Medical Officer Major Tsunesa Koichi of the Katata warship, Paymaster Major Tomizu Hisasamu of the Hozugawa warship, Artillery Chief Captain Yamafuji Gunji of the Fushimi warship, Adjutant and Staff Major Shiba Kitaaki of the Special Naval Landing Force, Staff Major Yasuda Yoshitatsu, Artillery Chief Lieutenant Nakagawa Otoki of the 16th Destroyer Squadron's Karukaya warship, and over 3,800 deceased naval landing force soldiers. The confirmed casualties on the army side include: Brigade Commander Kuranaga, Staff Major Mori Tokugen Go of the 12th Brigade of the 12th Division of Kurume, Attached Officer Miyoshi Akihara, Adjutant Ensign Yasukawa Osamu, Machine Gun Chief Lieutenant Koseki Nari, Chief Medical Officer Ensign Nakamura Hisashi, Paymaster Ito Shiro of the 18th Brigade of the 9th Division, Adjutant Oshima Shigekichi, Adjutant Maruyasu Tokushin of the 6th Division, Artillery Chief Ensign Horita Yuji, Machine Gun Chief Ensign Itakura Goro, and about 10,000 infantrymen.</p>
<p>The enemy army has launched fierce attacks on all fronts in recent days, hoping to achieve its goal of a quick victory, but everywhere it has encountered strong counterattacks and has made no progress, suffering heavy losses instead. Two enemy hospital ships are anchored in front of the Japanese Consulate, and wounded soldiers from all fronts are being transported there for treatment. From 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM yesterday, dozens of trucks were transporting wounded soldiers, being extremely busy, lasting for five hours. This shows the severity of the enemy army's losses.</p>
<p>At 7:35 AM yesterday morning, the enemy Red Cross transport ship Kinugasa, which was docked at the Shanghai Mitsubishi Wharf, after unloading a large batch of medical supplies, loaded a large number of enemy wounded soldiers and the ashes of cremated corpses. The ship then sailed out of Songkou and returned to Japan at 1:30 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Central Executive and Supervisory Committees Pay Tribute to Martyrs of the War of Resistance</h3>
<p>May Our National Military and Civilians Strengthen Themselves Even More / Resolve to Die and Seek Final Victory</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The Central Executive and Supervisory Committees recently issued a nationwide telegram, "To the Military Affairs Commission to forward to all units, the Executive Yuan to forward to all agencies, the provincial and municipal party headquarters to forward to all levels of party headquarters, and all groups for their attention: Our country is oppressed by a strong neighbor, and we can no longer tolerate it. To resist and survive, for a month now, soldiers in all fronts have followed the teachings of President Sun to achieve success through sacrifice, resolutely obeyed Commander-in-Chief Chiang's instructions to defend the country, all fighting the enemy with flesh and blood, vying to be the first to ascend. Their loyalty, bravery, and willingness to sacrifice for the country are truly unprecedented since ancient times. Recently, such as the sacrifice of Yang Fanggui's entire regiment at Nankou, and the determination of Yao Zixiang's entire battalion to perish with the isolated city of Baoshan, their lofty spirit and the intensity of their sacrifice are enough to move heaven and earth and make gods weep. The Central Committee expresses its deepest condolences and admiration for the martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country. In addition to the National Government granting generous pensions to comfort their loyal souls, we express our deepest sorrow with utmost sincerity. May our national military and civilians strengthen themselves even more, and strive with the determination to die to seek final victory. Only by extinguishing the enemy's fierce flames of aggression can the country's permanent survival be guaranteed, and only then can we fulfill the responsibilities to the deceased, and only then can the spirits of the martyrs rest in peace. We issue this sincere message with blood and tears, and we hope that all our compatriots will heed this message. The Central Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Kuomintang. (Central News Agency, 10th)"</p>
<h3>Fierce Artillery Battles Erupted Twice Again in the Huangpu River Yesterday</h3>
<p>Enemy Attempts to Land at Lujiazui Repelled by Us / Two Destroyers and Transport Ships Damaged and Fled / Many Enemy Positions and Consulate Hit</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, during the second artillery battle in Pudong from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM yesterday, our artillery units in Pudong also fired heavy artillery in retaliation. Every shot hit its mark with amazing accuracy. The Japanese Consulate was hit by a total of five shells, causing extensive damage. When the fifth shell hit, the consulate immediately caught fire, but it was quickly extinguished. At the time, one destroyer of the enemy's 21st Destroyer Squadron, which was operating in the Huangpu River, was hit by several shells on its deck. Its smokestack and turret were destroyed. Fortunately, the engine room was not damaged, and it still fled downstream.</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM yesterday, the enemy ships anchored in the Huangpu River suddenly bombarded our Pudong positions. Our artillery positions in Pudong immediately retaliated with dense artillery fire. Around 11:40 AM, our army hit the vicinity of the Japanese Mail Steamship Company pier with two shells, causing considerable damage to the enemy. Two teams of enemy planes flew to Pudong to scout, attempting to attack our artillery positions, circling for a long time, but found nothing. The enemy warships in the Huangpu River continued to bombard us, especially the enemy gunboat No. 30, which was anchored at the Japanese Mail Steamship Company pier. The bombardment ceased at 1:20 PM. Then, at 4:40 PM, the enemy warships bombarded our Pudong again, and our artillery also retaliated with heavy artillery.</p>
<p>Enemy Destroyer Hit in the Stern</p>
<p>At about 5:00 PM, one enemy destroyer, No. 21, sailed into the Huangpu River from Songkou to assist in the battle. When it reached the Jiangmian area north of the China Merchants Bureau wharf, it was hit by one of our shells, suffering heavy damage to its stern. It turned around sharply and fled downstream. At that time, a second shell followed closely behind, missing by only a few feet, unfortunately. Subsequently, two enemy planes flew to scout over Pudong. Our artillery was silent, and the enemy planes gained nothing and left. Our artillery positions then continued to fire, and the enemy flagship Izumo, as well as the destroyer anchored at the No. 1 buoy, the gunboat at the No. 4 buoy, and the gunboat No. 30 and a transport ship anchored at the Japanese Mail Steamship Company pier, also concentrated artillery fire and attacked our Pudong fiercely. The density of the fire was like a string of pearls.</p>
<p>Enemy Plot to Land Repelled by Us</p>
<p>At about 5:20 PM, enemy troops, divided into several small boats, under the cover of artillery fire, attempted to land at Lujiazui, but were repelled by our dense machine gun fire. At this time, the artillery battle was still continuing, with rumbling artillery fire, shaking the entire city. However, the enemy warship's bombardment was aimless, and apart from many civilian houses being destroyed in Pudong, our army suffered no losses. On the other hand, our bombardment was extremely accurate. The Japanese Mail Steamship Company pier, the Osaka pier, and the Huangpu pier were hit by many of our shells, causing extremely heavy losses to the enemy. Many enemy positions in the vicinity of the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road and Yuanfang Road in Nanxun Road were also hit. A large fire broke out on Yuanfang Road, spreading fiercely.</p>
<p>Enemy Transport Ship Also Hit</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, an enemy transport ship anchored at the Mail Steamship Company pier was also hit by one of our shells. The warehouse opened its anchors and fled downstream. Three shells landed near the Izumo flagship, but unfortunately missed. The sound of artillery gradually subsided until 7:30 PM in the evening. In total, the enemy fired as many as two hundred shots, while we fired only fifty or so shells.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the enemy transported a large batch of land-based heavy artillery and tanks. At noon, they were unloaded at the Huishan Wharf and near the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road. During the unloading, they encountered our Pudong heavy artillery bombardment. One warship near the Japanese Consulate was hit by a shell in the stern, and black smoke billowed up, suffering heavy damage to the stern.</p>
<p>Three Shots, Three Hits, Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses</p>
<p>According to the Shishi News Agency, at 4:30 yesterday afternoon, the Izumo flagship, gunboat No. 16, a small gunboat, and a transport ship, a total of four ships anchored in the Huangpu River, simultaneously launched a fierce artillery attack on our Pudong positions. At the same time, more than a hundred enemy troops, divided into several small boats, under the cover of artillery fire, attempted to land. Four enemy planes hovered overhead, scouting to provide targets. At that time, the artillery fire was dense and fierce, shaking the entire city. Our army was calm and composed, and did not retaliate at first. When the enemy troops approached, they all fired machine guns, repelling them. Many of the enemy, unable to avoid the attack, fell into the river and died. The enemy warships then fired even more fiercely, and our army also fired back. The first shell landed near the enemy destroyer No. 16, and the enemy warship was immediately damaged and fled downstream. The second shell then hit the houses of the Japanese Telegraph Office behind the enemy position at the Japanese Consulate, and a fire immediately broke out and burned fiercely, with thick smoke covering the sky. A third shell then hit the stern of a transport ship, and smoke immediately billowed out. Many enemy troops on board were killed or wounded. The ship then also fled downstream in panic. In this battle, our army fired three shots, and each time hit its target, without a single wasted shot, greatly disheartening the enemy. At that time, reporters and several Westerners were watching from a tall building, and the situation on both sides was clearly visible. The Westerners all expressed their admiration for our gunners' skills and accurate aiming. By 6:00 PM, the enemy's attempt to land had failed again, and the sound of artillery then ceased.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchant Warehouse Catches Fire After Being Hit</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the enemy's artillery battle in the Huangpu River was fierce, and its sound was heard far and wide. At 5:00 PM, the enemy destroyer No. 16, anchored at the Mitsubishi Wharf, about two or three piers away from the river surface, was hit by a shell from our [illegible] artillery position, destroying the deck of the stern of the warship, and immediately left. At the same time, the enemy flagship Izumo, which was protected by the destroyer, also moved about five yards east to avoid our artillery's target. One of our artillery shells hit the Mitsubishi Company's warehouse, causing significant damage.</p>
<p>A Japanese merchant warehouse near the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road suddenly caught fire after being hit by a shell at about 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>At about 6:00 PM yesterday, in the Yangshupu and Zhabei areas, there was a mutual artillery battle. Civilian houses near the Triangle Small Vegetable Market on the Bazilu Road in Hongkou were hit by enemy artillery fire and immediately caught fire. At first, thick smoke filled the air, and then flames soared into the sky, spreading fiercely to the southeast.</p>

There has been no action regarding the Sino-Japanese issue. The second meeting will be held before next Tuesday. According to semi-official US sources, if the League of Nations convenes the Advisory Committee of 23 Nations established by the Special Assembly of 1933, the United States will naturally continue to participate. League of Nations officials say that the attitude of the United Kingdom and France toward future sanctions against Japan by the League of Nations will depend on the outcome of the Mediterranean conference held in Nyon. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Paris] A French Foreign Ministry spokesman announced today that if China lodges a protest with the League of Nations against Japan, France hopes that the United States can attend the League of Nations Council meeting as an observer, at which time "a joint action might be decided, and the United States might come forward to participate." It is predicted that the Council may pass a resolution advocating that the Sino-Japanese conflict be submitted to arbitration. (National News Agency dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>[Paris] French officials recently stated that the League of Nations will not actively interfere in the Sino-Japanese dispute and the Spanish issue. Regarding the Sino-Japanese dispute, if the Council deals with it, France will suggest that the Advisory Committee established by the Extraordinary Assembly of the League of Nations on February 24, 1933, for the Manchurian Incident resume its work, with the participation of the United Kingdom, because to handle the Far East incident and make it effective, the cooperation of the United States is indispensable. Regarding Spain's complaint about the sinking of its ships, the League of Nations will only pass a resolution of a general nature and will not recommend concrete action, because concrete action must be passed unanimously by all member states before it can be implemented. Today, it is not possible for all member states to agree on action against a major European power. French officials finally said that the diplomatic authorities of the United Kingdom and France have decided to cooperate closely on all issues and will not allow any attempts to undermine the understanding between the two countries to succeed.

<p>[Nanjing] Since the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, Japan has continued to advance and aggress. In North China, after occupying Peiping and Tianjin, the Japanese army advanced towards Chahar and Suiyuan. In Shanghai, Japan again took the opportunity to create a tragic incident and recently expanded the war to Central and South China. Our country cannot tolerate it any longer and has risen in self-defense and implemented resistance. Regarding these facts, our government, as a member state of the League of Nations, has the duty to notify the League of Nations. Therefore, on August 30, we submitted a formal statement to the League of Nations regarding the Japanese side's repeated provocations and the circumstances of the incident, as well as our country's love of peace and the pain of having no choice but to implement self-defense. On September 10, a supplementary statement was submitted, which was distributed by the League of Nations to all member states and the Sino-Japanese problem advisory committee (including the US representative for review). The full text of the first statement is translated as follows:</p>
<p>On the night of July 7, Japanese troops conducted illegal exercises at Lugouqiao. Lugouqiao is adjacent to Peiping and is a key transportation hub and a military stronghold. There is no existing treaty basis for the Japanese warlords to go there. Then, under the pretext that a soldier was missing, they requested to enter the neighboring city of Wanping at night to search. When the Chinese authorities refused their request, the Japanese army immediately attacked Wanping with infantry and artillery forces, and the Chinese defense forces were forced to resist. From the beginning, the Chinese authorities expressed their willingness to resolve the Lugouqiao Incident peacefully, but the Japanese side took this opportunity to pursue its conspiracy in North China, causing China to have no choice but to resist by force, thus promoting the tragedy of bloodshed in East Asia. The current resistance is just the beginning of this tragedy. In order to avoid further expansion of the incident and hoping to achieve a peaceful solution through normal diplomatic channels, the Chinese authorities have exerted great tolerance for the repeated provocations of the Japanese army and have proposed that both sides withdraw their troops in order to isolate the opposing armies. Later, even before the Japanese army withdrew, they voluntarily withdrew their troops from the conflict area, which clearly demonstrated China's intention to maintain peace. However, the Japanese side deliberately expanded the situation. Initially, they dispatched a large army to Hebei and repeatedly attacked the Lugouqiao area of Peiping. Then, they expanded the area of military operations to the suburbs of Wanping, making the situation increasingly serious. The local Chinese authorities have continuously devoted themselves to a peaceful solution to the repeated and serious provocations of the Japanese side and accepted the conditions proposed by the Japanese side on July 11, which are as follows: (1) The representative of the 29th Army expressed regret to the Japanese army and punished those responsible and stated that they would be responsible for preventing similar incidents from happening again in the future. (2) In order to avoid being too close to the Japanese garrison in Fengtai and easily causing trouble, the Chinese army will not garrison the Lugouqiao Chenghuang Temple and Longwang Temple, and the security team will maintain order. (3) This incident is considered to have originated from the guidance of the so-called Blue Shirts Society, the Communist Party, and various other anti-Japanese groups. Therefore, we will discuss countermeasures and thoroughly ban them. On July 12, the Japanese Embassy received an order from its government, and the deputy military attache of the army and the deputy military attache of the navy visited the Chinese diplomatic authorities, asking the Chinese government not to interfere with the local solution agreed on the 11th. The Chinese diplomatic authorities replied that any local agreement must be approved by the Chinese central government before it can be valid, and at the same time proposed that both sides withdraw their troops to their original defenses and wait for the settlement of the incident. Later, when the Chinese local authorities withdrew their troops in accordance with the solution, the Japanese side took the opportunity to expand its military operations and provocative attacks to the Peiping-Tianjin area. According to the estimate on July 15, the Japanese army in the Peiping-Tianjin area had reached more than 30,000 people, and there were 100 aircraft, and a large number of troops outside the pass were ready to move. Under this kind of military threat, the local representatives felt very difficult to negotiate, especially because the Japanese side arbitrarily put forward conditions as a supplement to the solution on July 11, and all contacts became more difficult. On July 16, China sent a memorandum to the governments of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Belgium, Holland, Portugal (the above nine signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty), Germany, and the Soviet Union, pointing out that Japan's sudden attack on Lugouqiao with a large number of troops to invade North China was a clear violation of Chinese sovereignty and a violation of the letter and spirit of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Paris Peace Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant, urging the governments of those countries to pay attention. The memorandum also stated that although China was forced to use all means to defend its territory and national survival, it still temporarily intended to resolve its dispute with Japan through any peaceful means recognized by international law or treaties. On July 17, the Japanese Embassy sent a memorandum to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting the central government not to interfere in local negotiations and not to make any military preparations. On the same day, the Japanese military attache received an order from the Tokyo Army Ministry, expressing opposition to China's reinforcement of troops to Hebei to the Chinese Ministry of Military Affairs, even for the purpose of self-defense, and threatened "serious consequences." The Chinese government responded to this unreasonable request in writing on July 19, reiterating the previous proposal, that is, both sides stop military action and agree on a date for each to withdraw their troops to their original defenses. The reply also clearly stated that the Chinese government, in order to peacefully resolve this unfortunate incident, was prepared to accept any peaceful means of handling international disputes recognized by international law or treaties, such as direct negotiations, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, etc. Unfortunately, this peaceful proposal did not receive the expected response, and the Chinese government did not object to the solution reached by its local authorities and the Japanese army on July 11. From this, it can be seen that China's repeated tolerance has reached its maximum limit. According to the above, it is very obvious that Japan has used the Lugouqiao Incident from two aspects to try to realize its goal of military, political, and economic control of North China. In the military aspect, in order to prepare for large-scale aggression, Japan has continuously dispatched a large army into Hebei, while at the same time preventing the Chinese central government from making preparations for self-defense, hoping to make it easier for the Chinese local authorities to fall within the scope. In the diplomatic aspect, Japan intends to put pressure on the Chinese central government to make it indifferent to North China and to pre-agree to any conditions accepted by the local authorities due to being exclusively subject to Japanese military pressure. Later, after the Japanese army knew that China could not only obey Japan's orders, it sent an ultimatum to the Chinese local authorities on July 26, demanding that the Chinese army withdraw from Peiping and the vicinity of Peiping, which was not included in the solution on July 11. Before the deadline set by the Japanese ultimatum had expired, the Japanese army and air force had already launched a large-scale offensive in the Peiping-Tianjin area, wantonly trampling and destroying the lives and property of civilians and educational and cultural institutions, which shocked the world. After the Chinese army withdrew from Peiping and Tianjin, the Japanese army expanded its military operations and went deep into southern Hebei, still thinking it was not enough, and further attacked the Nankou fortress on the border between Hebei and Chahar, which has not yet stopped. According to the estimate on August 20, Japan has about 100,000 troops in North China. Japan's concentration of such a large army on Chinese territory clearly indicates its intention to conquer by force as a fixed policy and to carry out aggression on the Asian continent. In view of past events, the Chinese government is deeply afraid that Japan will repeat its old tricks and wantonly provoke incidents in Shanghai, disrupting our commercial and financial center. Therefore, when the north was in crisis, it repeatedly ordered the Shanghai local authorities to take special precautions to avoid unfortunate incidents. However, on August 9, two Japanese naval officers and soldiers attempted to resist police orders and entered the Chinese military airfield in Hongqiao without authorization, and a conflict occurred with the Chinese security team. One Japanese naval officer and one soldier were killed, and one Chinese security team soldier was also killed. As a result, China's efforts to maintain peace in Shanghai failed again. After the incident, although the Shanghai Municipal Government immediately proposed to resolve it through diplomatic channels, Japan still relied on force to expand the situation. Within 24 hours, Japan concentrated more than 30 warships in Shanghai, and its armed forces also increased by thousands. At the same time, it put forward demands, attempting to cancel or destroy the Chinese authorities' self-defense measures. On August 13, the Japanese Marine Corps launched a large-scale offensive against Jiangwan and Zhabei from land and sea based on the international settlement. Thus, Japan's predetermined plan to invade Shanghai was launched four days after the Hongqiao Airport incident. Since then, the Japanese air force has been active, and no provinces such as Shandong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi have been spared. Nanjing is the capital of China, and Japanese planes have attacked every day, almost without interruption. Other important cities have also been ravaged. Japan's intention is to use its numerical superiority in the air force to wantonly bomb the prosperous areas where China's economic, cultural, and Sino-foreign trade centers are located, in order to reduce China's strength to resist. The above is a rough account of Japan's actions since the Lugouqiao Incident on July 7. Based on this, it is obvious and undeniable that the following four points are very clear and certain: (1) The Japanese armed forces have actually invaded Chinese territory, and their army, navy, and air force are carrying out large-scale attacks on the northern and central defense areas of China, which is a purely aggressive action and is very obvious. (2) China has exhausted all methods to repel violence to no avail, and has now taken military action to exercise its inherent right of self-defense, which was not China's original intention, but was forced to do so. (3) Japan's current actions in China are a continuation of its aggression plan that began in the three northeastern provinces on September 18, 1931. Japan has now abandoned its promise not to have territorial ambitions in China, occupied Peiping and Tianjin, and is even trying to seize the entire North China and control other areas. The construction work that China has worked hard to build for ten years is also being destroyed by it. (4) Japan's intention to disrupt peace in East Asia in this way has violated the basic principles of the League of Nations Covenant, using war as a tool of national policy, disregarding all peaceful methods of resolving international disputes, which is a violation of the 1928 Paris Peace Pact, and not abiding by its obligations to respect China's sovereignty, independence, and territorial and administrative integrity, which is a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty concluded in Washington in 1922.

<h3>Kung Hsiang-hsi Condemns Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>And Explains the Sino-Soviet Agreement</p>
<p>[Berlin] Dr. Kung Hsiang-hsi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, is currently recuperating at Bad Gastein Spa and recently issued a statement to the newspapers, saying, "After the conclusion of the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty, Japan complained. It should be noted that Germany had also concluded a non-aggression pact with Poland (January 26, 1934), and Poland had also concluded a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union (July 3, 1933). Therefore, there is also an indirect relationship between Germany and the Soviet Union, but Japan has no complaints about Germany. Why? Also, the Treaty of Friendship and Neutrality between Germany and the Soviet Union (April 24, 1926) was extended in 1933 by the Third Reich. Japan seems to have forgotten this. According to the argument held by Japan, any country that signs a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union should be considered a Bolshevik country or have the danger of becoming red. If this is the case, then in addition to Poland, Finland and Turkey are also suspected of being red. Vice President Kung then verified Japan's actions and said, where does Japan's unprovoked war against China and disregard for international law stand? Japan once promised to uphold the principle of open door within the "Manchukuo" territory, where is this principle now? Compared with other countries, China is not backward and has sufficient strength to live peacefully with any country. Japan's invasion of China is not the first time. The unity that China has worked hard to achieve over the years has been further enhanced by Japan's acts of aggression. At present, China has great confidence and will never be discouraged by failure, nor will it be arrogant because of victory." (Havas dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Yoshida and Sugimura Discuss in England</h3>
<p>[London] Japanese Ambassador to the UK Yoshida and Ambassador to France Sugimura recently met here for talks. The discussion focused on the establishment of the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan, Italy, and Germany. Regarding this matter, Japanese sources in London are very silent but admit that Sugimura came to England from Paris to meet with Yoshida to discuss the international situation. They said that all countries that oppose communism can participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact between Japan and Germany. As for the talks between Japan and Italy, they have been going on for quite some time but have not yet reached the final stage. Well-informed British sources recently stated that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini gave a speech in Palermo in May, criticizing communism, and at present, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Italy has become tense due to the Soviet ship attack incident. All of this makes it easier to expand the scope of the anti-communist bloc. (Havas dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>US Authorities Declare Responsibility for Protecting American Nationals</h3>
<p>Do Not Withdraw Warships and Troops Stationed in China; US Newspapers Say Roosevelt Is Weak</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that the United States has no intention of withdrawing its troops and warships stationed in China while the Sino-Japanese war continues, and that a government's responsibility to protect its nationals always exists during dangerous times. Hull also said that there are currently about 8,000 American nationals in China, who are gradually evacuating. He finally stated that the US government recognizes its obligation to protect American people from atrocities and to assist American nationals in escaping dangerous areas. The US government does not believe that this responsibility has ended as long as any Americans remain in China. Hull reiterated the US's Far East policy, which is in response to protests from Americans in China. (Reuters dispatch, 9th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Washington Morning Post said in an editorial today that there is no dispute among Americans about the lack of practicality of the United States' Far East policy. Roosevelt's initial attitude towards American nationals in China was not his original intention. Later, his attitude became clearer, as it was stated that after the evacuation of American nationals in China, the US Navy would still remain in the Far East to protect the interests of Americans. However, this policy, from the perspective of aggression, is still an exposure of weakness, and its passivity is similar to neutrality, but different in reality.

<h3>Japanese Military Supplies Secretly Discovered in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>The Society Suddenly Becomes Terrified, and Residents Move Away in Succession</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] According to returning guests from Hong Kong, on the ninth of this month and later, the Hong Kong police discovered a large quantity of explosives, bombs, and hand grenades secretly hidden by the Japanese in the Tokyo Hotel on Qianyao Road. They immediately transported the criminals and dangerous goods to the Police Department for safekeeping. After this news spread, Hong Kong society suddenly became terrified. The purpose of the Japanese secretly hiding dangerous goods in Hong Kong is to destroy the traffic on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway or to disrupt Hong Kong's security. The Police Department is currently conducting a strict interrogation. However, based on the recent obstruction of British ships by Japanese warships and the landing of troops on Dongsha Island and Lingding Island, the threat to Hong Kong has been fully confirmed. How the Hong Kong authorities will respond to this crisis to protect their century-long lifeline in the Far East is still unclear at this time. However, residents who generally regard Hong Kong as a safe zone have moved away in succession to Singapore, the Philippines, and the interior of Guangdong Province. In recent days, the number of tourists in Hong Kong's hotels has suddenly decreased, and rents have been reduced. Ships sailing from Hong Kong to the province are once again crowded, which is the opposite of the situation before the events. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>

Soon, under the leadership of the central government, a central alliance for national spiritual mobilization will be organized, with each prefecture and county organizing an executive committee and each city, town, and village organizing an implementation group. It will also implement "iron collection weeks," with elementary school students across the country collecting iron scraps for use, advocating labor service and public service.

<h3>Firm Determination to Resist the War</h3>
<p>— Celebrating</p>
<p>The Shanghai battle has been going on for nearly a month. The enemy is constantly reinforcing its troops. The army it has mobilized has reached eight divisions. The number of participating aircraft has also exceeded 200. However, as a result of the courageous resistance of our army and air force, the enemy is still trapped in the narrow coastal line along the river. They are only relying on the firepower of warships for support, and the isolated troops that have landed are spared from being completely annihilated. In these few days, their sharp weapons and dense firepower have not been able to shake our army's solid line of defense. And the failure of successive charges has greatly damaged their combat power. From a military point of view, our country is already in an absolute advantage.</p>
<p>As for the political aspect, our country is united from top to bottom, with everyone working together, and the phenomenon of national unity is unprecedented. The government's wartime financial policy and economic mobilization methods have gained the unanimous support of the people. After implementation, the financial situation is stable, the market is calm, and the phenomenon of capital outflow can be prevented. The crisis of rising prices can be curbed. The evil wind of manipulation and hoarding suddenly disappeared, and the people's food problem was solved. During this difficult period, the people do not avoid hardships and actively engage in consolation, rescue, and consolidation of the rear. Although enemy planes rampage everywhere and civilians are tragically sacrificed, the people, in addition to grief and indignation, have strengthened their determination to resist the enemy. Social order is well-maintained and not chaotic. This kind of spirit not only shows that our country's victory in the war of resistance is inevitable, but also enough to awe heaven and earth and move ghosts and gods.</p>
<p>However, during this war of resistance, there are still many people who, due to insufficient understanding of the current situation of the war, have pessimistic psychology intentionally or unintentionally. Therefore, when talking about international relations, they always look at the surface, thinking that the great powers related to the Far East will not be able to effectively sanction the aggressor. When talking about military affairs, they always estimate only weapons, thinking that under the fierce artillery fire of the political enemy, it is difficult for our army to sustain combat. This kind of seemingly right but actually wrong view, although it seems to be out of enthusiasm for caring about national affairs, its impact is actually enough to shake people's hearts and blur the awareness that resistance will surely win.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the development of this pessimistic psychology can even help the enemy and harm the war of resistance. Our country's war of resistance this time is a protracted and all-national war of resistance, while the enemy's ambition is to fight a quick war and make the war localized. Today, the most outstanding military talents in our country have concentrated their efforts and made long-term plans for military affairs. All our people can only give absolute trust to achieve the final victory. If a small setback in military affairs in a certain time and place leads to pessimistic views, then the psychology of fearing the enemy will be formed. The enemy's conspiracy will be fulfilled by the traitors' rumors that are spread by the enemy by taking the opportunity.</p>
<p>We must know that today is a critical moment for fighting for national survival. All citizens with conscience should not be excluded from the anti-war front. Eliminating pessimistic psychology and determining the determination to resist the war is the first condition to ensure the final victory. I sincerely hope that those who are responsible for organizing the masses and training the masses will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Our Army's Heroic Defeat of the Enemy is Unanimously Praised by British, American, and French Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Those Who Held Doubts Should Also Take a New Look, and Although Japan Will Not Collapse Immediately, the World's Disaster Has Been Reduced</p>
<p>[London] The Times commented today on the war in China, stating briefly that it is difficult for Japan to win a decisive battle in any formation before late autumn at the earliest. It is also impossible to win any decisive battle that can automatically end the war. Japan itself knows this concept. The News Article's editorial stated that people all over the world sympathize with the Chinese army's courageous resistance in Shanghai. In the history of wars between countries, it is rare for one country to gain such great sympathy from neutral countries as China today. In the past, some people in Britain would always defend Japan when something happened, but now they are silent. Even Germany, which recently signed an anti-communist agreement with Tokyo, is treating the Sino-Japanese War with indifference. China's strategy is to try its best to prevent the Japanese army from advancing as far as possible, so that Japan's already cracked economy can collapse due to this war. In short, the longer the war lasts, the less of a threat Japan will pose to the entire world. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>[New York] The New York Times commented on the Far East situation today, stating briefly that observing the Chinese people's current unity and sincerity in resisting Japan, it can be seen that China has reached the realm of unity. Those who viewed China with suspicion should now take a new look. The newspaper also stated that Japan's purpose in fighting China this time is to defeat China in a short period of time. However, China's strategy must be to prolong its resistance to Japan, so that Japan's economic structure will collapse and it will not be able to continue its aggression against China. At the very least, it will prevent Japan from making harsh demands on China. Judging from the magnificence and determination of China's resistance against Japan today, although China is facing great economic difficulties, the final victory can be achieved. (National News Agency dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The New York Tribune praised the bravery of the Chinese soldiers in resisting the war and their achievements, which shocked both China and foreign countries. It cited the "January 28th Incident" and the Shanghai battle as examples, stating briefly that the Chinese soldiers have not retreated under the threat of Japan's sharpest weapons, and their strength remains intact, which is admirable. The Chinese soldiers are fighting for their principles, so they feel invincible. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 9th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] The International Report published an article by French Permanent Representative to the League of Nations, Peng Gu, entitled "Prospects of the Chinese War," stating briefly that Japan is waging an undeclared war against China under the guise of protecting its borders and eliminating dangerous propaganda. It is extremely clear who the aggressor is, but the attitude of the great powers is still ambiguous. Indeed, the League of Nations has been rendered weak and incompetent because it was unable to prevent Italy from annexing Abyssinia and could not eliminate the Spanish Civil War. However, its current inability to cope with the Chinese war and the passive policy adopted by the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty are to blame. This not only endangers the balance of power in Europe and Asia, but can also be a fuse for the First World War. It is insufficient for the great powers to only protect the interests of their僑民 in Shanghai. As for adopting a policy of reconciling the aggressor and the aggressed, it is a hypocritical attempt. The last British cabinet meeting decided to "mediate the Sino-Japanese dispute in order to resolve it," which is shocking to hear. In 1932, the League of Nations was able to prevent, limit, and mitigate Japan's occupation of Chinese territory with just a declaration. We acknowledge that according to Tanaka's plan, what Japan needs is not only to annex Asia, but also to occupy the whole of Europe. The Western powers and the United States have been warned. However, what makes people most undoubted at present is that China relies on its own powerful army to protect its freedom and independence. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<h3>Three Major International Conferences Open in Switzerland</h3>
<p>The Executive Council of the League of Nations Discusses the Spanish Issue, and the British and French Views Are Consistent at the Mediterranean Conference</p>
<p>[Geneva] Three important international conferences are being held simultaneously in Switzerland today: the International Executive Council meeting held at 11:00 AM, the Mediterranean Conference held at 4:30 PM, and the meeting of 28 countries to discuss the revision of the League of Nations Covenant, which will be held at 3:00 PM. Although there are many important issues on the agenda of the Executive Council of the League of Nations, such as the Sino-Japanese conflict, the Spanish Civil War, and the division of Palestine, today's meeting is a completely formal secret meeting. The Mediterranean Conference has reduced its interest due to the refusal of Germany and Italy to participate. It is expected that after British Foreign Secretary Eden delivers the opening speech, it will end quickly. It is heard that the United Kingdom originally intended to propose a motion, but it has now been replaced by a draft based on the submarine warfare treaty attached to the London Naval Treaty. Thereafter, countries can freely participate, and it is heard that Eden will emphasize the technical nature of the meeting in his speech and will organize a committee of experts to study the content of the treaty after other representatives have spoken. The most peculiar point of the Executive Council meeting of the League of Nations is that the Prime Minister of the Spanish government, Negrin, will deliver the opening speech of the meeting as acting chairman. It is expected that he will take this opportunity to represent his country's government and strongly advocate for the League of Nations to intervene in the Spanish Civil War. Regarding the non-participation of Germany and Italy in the Mediterranean Conference, London has expressed its regret, but it feels that the British amendment will make submarine attacks quite difficult. As for Germany and Italy's proposal to transfer the Mediterranean issue to the Spanish Civil War non-intervention committee, the United States will not discuss it, because the British side believes that the scope of the Mediterranean issue is broader than the Spanish Civil War non-intervention issue. The issue of navigation safety outside Spanish territorial waters is of course not within the duties of the non-intervention committee. (Central News Agency Reuters dispatch of the 10th)</p>
<p>◎ Nyon, Switzerland: The Mediterranean Conference is scheduled to open here tomorrow afternoon. Representatives from the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, Greece, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Romania, Bulgaria, and Egypt will attend. Journalists may attend and listen. At that time, British Foreign Secretary Eden will chair the meeting and give a welcome speech to the representatives of various countries, explaining that this meeting is entirely of a technical nature, and proposing to immediately appoint a specialized committee, and submit the specific proposals put forward by the United Kingdom and France to the committee for discussion. It is expected that French Foreign Minister Delbos will support this proposal, and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov will express his opinion on the fact that the Spanish communist government has not been invited to participate in the conference. It is expected that the specialized committees will be established tomorrow and will begin to discuss the proposals made by the United Kingdom and France on Saturday and Sunday.

<h3>Japan is Quite Anxious about the Shanghai Battle, and the Head of the Air Force Has Been Replaced</h3>
<p>Nagasaki's Lights Are All Extinguished to Prevent Our Air Raids, and Military Expenses in China Require 50 Million Yuan per Month</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that a well-known foreign businessman in the city recently returned to Shanghai from Japan on the Nagasaki Maru and told a reporter from the "Great American Evening Post" his impressions of the recent situation in Japan. The main points were that Japan is now completely in a state of war, war bonds are being issued, countless ships are constantly transporting troops to China, and the entire country's industry is engaged in the manufacture of military supplies. The general public in the country seems to approve of all the bills in parliament, but senior merchants are now losing their commodity markets and their own interests are greatly affected, so they are unhappy with the war. During this war, the Japanese financial community has strict restrictions on payments and foreign exchange, so the market is quite panicked. Almost all of the country's ships have now been requisitioned, but passenger lines continue to be maintained. The Nagasaki Maru, which I was on, continued to operate as scheduled. The Japanese authorities are quite anxious about the war. Important military officers have been changed. The head of the Air Force has now been replaced, which shows that the political authorities are very dissatisfied with the original presiding officers. There is a great lack of real war information in Japan. The news spread by newspapers and wireless is strictly censored by the authorities, and many of the messages are obviously fabricated. Short-wave radios are prohibited in Japan, and even long-wave radios can only listen to local broadcasts. The only thing the people can know is how Japan is winning. The newspapers are also full of propaganda. A few days ago, a famous newspaper published that 75 Soviet planes had arrived in Shanghai. On the day of departure, the newspaper also published that the Soviet Union had supplied China with 250 planes, 150 heavy artillery pieces, and 75 field artillery pieces. The military community expressed that the war would end in mid-November at the earliest, or by the end of the year at the latest. The 200 million yen war budget proposed by the military department has now been passed by parliament. Monthly war expenses require about 50 million yuan. The military side still felt that the amount passed was not enough. According to my understanding from various aspects, there are currently 380,000 Japanese troops in China, and this will have to be increased to one million by the beginning of December. Japan desperately hopes that the war will end sooner, but in fact this is impossible. After arriving here, I am even more convinced that the war will be prolonged. The strength shown by the Japanese Air Force in this war is not as good as most people imagine. Recently, 60 new aircraft were manufactured. Twelve of them were transported to China without even holding the naming ceremony, because the front line had a great need for aircraft. The Japanese people are quite wary of the Chinese Air Force. Every night, all the lights in Nagasaki are extinguished to prevent air raids, because the general psychology there is that they are at risk of being attacked by the Chinese Air Force at any time.</p>
<h3>British Chargé d'Affaires Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Visit Foreign Minister Wang in Beijing within Days, Ambassador Xu's Condition Is Improving Daily</p>
<p>After British Ambassador to China Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was injured in a Japanese attack, the British government specially sent Mr. O'Malley to China as Chargé d'Affaires. It is now known that Mr. O'Malley has arrived in Shanghai on the British warship HMS Brazen the day before yesterday and is scheduled to visit Foreign Minister Wang in Beijing within days. The director of the Foreign Ministry's office in Shanghai, Yu Ming, is currently telegraphing Beijing to request the date of the meeting. In addition, the British Ambassador's condition is improving daily, and he is expected to be discharged from the hospital next month.</p>
<h3>Five Types of Government Bonds Drawn as Usual</h3>
<p>Discounting of Matured Unified Government Bonds, Business As Usual</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, our financial authorities have stabilized the financial situation, maintained creditworthiness, and handled things properly, so social order has been unusually stable. Various maturing bonds in the past month have been redeemed as usual. It is now known that the five types of government bonds, including long-term financial bonds, which are due at the end of this month, were also drawn at the Bank Club yesterday morning at 10:00 AM amid the rumble of gunfire. Representatives from various supervisory agencies, such as Lin Jinyu, were presided over by the director of the Government Bonds Department, Tao Changshan, and a total of 27 ballots were drawn. The winning numbers are as follows: ① Five ballots for the 17th-year long-term financial government bonds are 001, 079, 095, 108, 182, 201, 261, 275, 334, 366, 392, 410, 416, 524, 547, 658, 687, 735, 751, 752, 817, 858, 876, 914, 992. ② Three ballots for telecommunications government bonds are 26, 84, 98. ③ Five ballots for Type B unified bonds are 191, 2103, 788, 805, 927. ④ Two ballots for consolidating Guangdong financial government bonds are 30, 36. ⑤ Two ballots for dredging Guangdong Port River US Dollar government bonds are 07, 85.

The payment date for the unified Type B is set for January 31 next year, and the other four types are this month. All are paid by the three banks in various places and the Central Trust Bureau. The discounting business for matured unified government bonds is also being handled as usual.</p>
<h3>City Relief Association Broadcast Fundraising</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Broadcasting Industry Association, together with the Entertainment Association, etc., will broadcast special programs to solicit donations for national salvation bonds starting from the 12th of this month. The content is very exciting, including dramas, storytelling ballads, Pinghua storytelling, stories, Su Tan opera, Shanghai opera, Ji Ji comedy, and singing by movie stars and singers, as well as Peking opera by famous amateur performers and actors. All programs can be requested at will by donors.</p>
<h3>Pacific Hurricane Strikes Japan</h3>
<p>The hurricane in the Pacific Ocean has reached 28 degrees North latitude and 130 degrees East longitude at 2:00 PM yesterday, moving north-northeast. The wind force is strongest on Izu Oshima. Osaka and Kobe will soon be hit. Domestic navigation in Japan will be severely affected.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Set Fire to Gongyi Fang on North Sichuan Road</h3>
<p>More than 40 Houses Burned Down; Central Firefighters Extinguish the Blaze</p>
<p>Gongyi Fang, located at Baziran, North Sichuan Road, was suddenly set on fire by Japanese soldiers at about 3:00 PM yesterday. Because the location was in the war zone, the fire spread uncontrollably. Later, the Central Fire Brigade made every effort to dispatch Western firefighters to the scene, and the fire was finally extinguished, but more than 40 houses had already been burned down.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telephones to Request Correction of Tax Collection Requiring Cash</h3>
<p>Stabilizing Finance by Restricting Cash Withdrawals; Ministry Approves Tax Payments by Check</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting the correction of the tax authority's method of collecting taxes that requires cash. The telegram stated: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, according to the Great China Match Company, our company used to pay account-recorded, unified tax and stamp tax with bank transfer checks without any problem. However, recently, the tax authority has refused to accept checks, insisting on cash payments and stopping the company's method of account-recorded stamp payments. Since the method of restricting cash withdrawals was clearly announced by the Ministry of Finance, and since unlimited cash withdrawals are not allowed, all donations and taxes can be paid by taxpayers with checks. The company's income from Japanese goods is also difficult to collect in cash due to the aforementioned restrictions. The tax authority's refusal to accept checks not only contradicts the Ministry's order, but also makes it impossible for the company to comply. Therefore, we especially request your esteemed council to submit this to the competent court and department to order the tax authority to allow our company to pay taxes with bank transfer checks to alleviate the company's difficulties. We are counting on it."</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the meeting, since all banks and money houses have followed the order to restrict deposits and withdrawals, it is well known that cash is not easy to obtain. Therefore, the Hubei Provincial Government requested to allow people to pay taxes by check, which was approved by your esteemed ministry and notified to the affiliated associations on record. The tax authority is an administrative agency directly under your esteemed ministry and should first comply with the ministry's orders. If one side restricts cash withdrawals while the other side forces the people to pay in cash, it will directly make merchants unable to cope, which is difficult to justify and will fundamentally destroy the method of stabilizing finance in extraordinary times. We have no choice but to request your esteemed ministry to strictly order a correction, in order to ensure consistent government orders and relieve the difficulties of merchants and people, which is in the public interest. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notifies Shops Not Allowed to Close</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice that shops are not allowed to close, stating: "This station has received an order from the municipal government that the business of shops in all cities and towns must not be closed unless absolutely necessary or by government order. The daily needs of frontline soldiers and urban residents are indispensable. If business is suspended for even one day, it will not only make residents feel inconvenienced, but also cause goods to accumulate and become difficult to circulate. Therefore, this is a notice to all industries in the city that those who have already opened for business should make every effort to circulate goods and maintain the livelihoods of workers, and those who have not yet opened for business should resume business as soon as possible. This is of utmost importance."</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Donations from All Walks of Life</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Malang Donate 20,000 Yuan; Refugee Savings Donated to Save the Nation</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Tzu Lien Association's refugee relief efforts learned that overseas Chinese in Malang donated 20,000 yuan in national currency for refugee relief. In addition to accepting the relief, the association sent a letter of thanks. Luo Jia San, a tallyman at the Heji Company specializing in overseas ship import and export, lost his job on August 15 after the Shanghai war began and business was suspended. His family of five had to flee the war zone and could only live by selling newspapers in the alley. Now that the soldiers who were in the front line bled and fought, all citizens have the responsibility to save the country. He donated 6.7 yuan from selling newspapers for eleven days for national salvation and delivered it to the Silk Industry Bank for transportation yesterday.</p>
<p>Since the City Relief Association was established, people from all walks of life have voluntarily donated funds and goods to help refugees. The association publishes the names of donors in the newspaper every week to show its integrity and to promote its work. In the past week, the war has intensified and the relief work has intensified. The people's donations of funds and goods have also been very enthusiastic. In particular, yesterday an old woman of about forty, claiming to be surnamed Xu, who usually makes a living by washing clothes, also felt compassion for the enemy's brutality and came to the general affairs group of the relief association to send her hard-earned funds, a total of six yuan, of which she designated three yuan to be donated to the medical profession and three yuan to be donated to the refugees, and also sent several cans of braised bamboo shoots, instructing them to be donated to the wounded soldiers for consumption. The association has separately received and sent them on her behalf. This is also the Piao Mu of today, a good story in the history of the War of Resistance. The fish wholesalers in the Shanghai Fish Market, feeling that the Japanese invaders had invaded the country, causing refugees in the war zone to be displaced, donated 852.26 yuan, the proceeds of 24 days of hard work, to the Shanghai Charitable Organization United Disaster Relief Association's Relief for War Zone Refugee Committee for the purpose of relieving refugees in the war zone. It is noted that these river fish wholesalers belong to the working class, but they are still concerned about the victims of the disaster and are enthusiastic about relief, which is very commendable. The Tzu Lien Association has sent a special letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>City Library Holds Rear Area Mobile Library</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the Shanghai City Library moved its office to adapt to the needs of the wartime. The library has launched a rear area mobile library, collecting various books and magazines with simple text, and going to the rear area wounded soldier hospitals to lend them to injured soldiers for reading, so that they can get mental and physical restoration and comfort. It is heard that this kind of rear area mobile library has been piloted at the Red Cross Hospital on Tianzhutang Street, and the results are very good. It will soon be extended to other wounded soldier hospitals.</p>
<h3>Tzu Lien Association Opens More Shelters</h3>
<p>The original 43 Shelters are Insufficient; Urgently Need Donations for 4 More Shelters</p>
<p>The Tzu Ching Organization United Disaster Relief Association's War Zone Refugee Relief Committee in Shanghai has recently opened four new shelters due to the surge in refugees, making a total of 47.  The original 43 shelters are insufficient to accommodate everyone. The four new shelters are located at Fuxing on Sima Road, Jiaozhou Road on Jiaozhou Road, Hubei Road on Jiangxi Road, and Yuanshun on West Xiqiao. These four shelters can accommodate more than 2,000 refugees. The association has recently been trying to send refugees away every day due to the surge in refugees, but there are still more than 30,000 refugees. The number of mouths to feed is huge and the resources are insufficient. We hope that philanthropists and Qing Shi will generously donate and enthusiastically contribute so that these tens of thousands of innocent disaster victims will not be left in a desperate situation.</p>
<h3>National Crisis Youth Service Group Seeks Youth Volunteers</h3>
<p>The National Crisis Youth Service Group at 1422 Aidao Road, Shanghai, has been approved and registered by the local party and government authorities and has been established for more than a week. The group has about 100 members and has been assigned to work in various places. The group has also obtained contact with the Red Cross Society to form a team to provide emergency first aid at the front line. Now, in order to achieve greater practical results, the group is seeking trained nursing personnel. All enthusiastic patriotic comrades who are physically strong and have a high school education can sign up to join, but they must fill out a volunteer form and have a guarantor and parental permission (application forms available).</p>
<h3>American Missionaries Refuse to Retreat and Promote Christian Doctrine</h3>
<p>War is an opportunity to promote religious doctrine; great spirit wins social admiration</p>
<p>The United States government has ordered all its people residing in China to evacuate. In addition to the American Chamber of Commerce in the city, which has expressed its unwillingness to sacrifice its decades of hard work, and telegraphed the government to further express its attitude, it is learned that the missionaries in various parts of our country have been teaching in China for decades. The churches, hospitals, schools, and various charitable undertakings that they have run have achieved great results and have been trusted by the Chinese people. Now that the war has begun, it is time for missionaries to promote the Christian spirit of fraternity and peace. Therefore, they have all firmly expressed their unwillingness to retreat. This great spirit has won widespread awe and admiration in our country.</p>

<h3>Enemy Ships Attack Yuepu and Yanghang; Fierce Battle from Last Night Until Noon Today Has Not Stopped</h3>
<p>Our Army Destroys Four Enemy Tanks; Enemy's Attack Along Jungong Road Fails Again; Confrontation in Miaohang Area of Wusong</p>
<p>The focus of the war is still in Yuepu, Yanghang, and Qiujiang Pier. The enemy is using all its strength from the sea, land, and air to break through our defense line, but they have been severely attacked by our loyal soldiers. The enemy's military plan after three reinforcements has obviously encountered unexpected serious setbacks. From last night to noon today, the main points of the war situation are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) This morning at dawn, several enemy tanks attacked our army's position near Yanghang along Baoyang Road. A bloody melee occurred near the bridge east of Yanghang. We destroyed four of their tanks. Another enemy infantry unit of more than 2,000 men attacked the left and right flanks of our army's position in Yanghang. The fierce battle continued until noon.</p>
<p>(2) The enemy at Qiujiang Pier attacked our chariot position along Jungong Road. The bloody battle continued all day. The enemies attacking from separate locations were all repulsed after defeat.</p>
<p>(3) The enemy in Wusong launched a fierce attack on our position near Zhangjia Village and captured places such as Wujia Zhai, confronting our troops in Miaohang. We are urgently transferring reinforcements to prepare for a counterattack.</p>
<p>(4) Enemy ships and enemy heavy artillery in the Huangpu River frequently bombarded our Far East Sports Field position this morning. We also responded with heavy artillery, causing considerable losses to the enemy.</p>
<p>(5) The enemy's several attacks in Zhabei last night failed. This morning, there was peace and quiet.</p>
<p>(6) There were no changes in Luodian. We still maintain an encirclement.</p>
<p>(This newspaper's special report: The enemy in the Qiujiang Pier area launched a fierce attack on us along Jungong Road. The bloody battle lasted all night from dawn yesterday to this morning. Our soldiers fought bravely, and the enemy made no progress.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Forced to Retreat in Yuepu</h3>
<p>On the Baoshan front, the enemy used its main force to attack our army's positions in Yuepu and Yanghang, attempting to link up with the enemy in Luodian. After being bravely repulsed by our troops yesterday, the battle on the Yuepu-Yanghang line was still very fierce last night. This morning at dawn, enemy warships from Baoshan concentrated their firepower and launched a fierce bombardment of our positions northeast of Yuepu-Yanghang. At the same time, they used more than ten tanks to advance along the Baoyang Highway, with their infantry units using the tanks as cover. Our frontline troops calmly responded to the battle. When they advanced to the vicinity of the bridge east of Yanghang, our mortar teams at that location suddenly concentrated their artillery fire and launched a fierce attack on the enemy's tanks. Under our concentrated artillery fire, four enemy vehicles were immediately destroyed. Our defending troops bravely rushed out and used machine guns and grenades to attack the invading infantry. The enemy troops were forced to retreat, and fierce fighting continued until noon.</p>
<p>Our left-wing position in Yanghang also discovered more than a thousand enemy infantry attacking us this morning at dawn. The enemy that moved in the middle was countered by our defending troops, who fought fiercely for four hours. The enemy has retreated and is now engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>The enemy has launched a full-scale attack on our Yuepu-Yanghang line from the Wusong and Baoshan roads. Yesterday, a very fierce bloody battle occurred with our troops all day long. Last night, our troops fought bravely, and under the enemy's concentrated artillery fire and tank assaults, they fell one after another and held their ground. At one point, our positions were invaded, but after several melees, they were still repulsed. The enemy invaded again this morning at dawn, and the bloody battle has continued until now. The stalemate cannot be broken. Our reinforcements have rushed from behind to join the battle, and the enemy has been defeated.</p>
<h3>Enemy Eliminated in Liujia Zhai and Other Places</h3>
<p>Our Taojia Zhai Position Recaptured; Zhangjia Village Enemy Troops Repulsed Again</p>
<p>After the enemy in Wusong was repulsed in its attempt to attack Yuepu and Yanghang yesterday, our troops advanced and pursued them last night, launching a night attack on the enemy at about 12:00 AM, attacking from both sides of the highway near Yanghang, and first eliminating the enemy in Liujia Zhai and Xinmu Bridge. Our vanguard troops advanced to the vicinity of Taojia Zhai, and the original positions were completely restored.</p>
<p>At about 5:00 AM this morning, the enemy again attacked our mouth's right wing near Zhangjia Village with more than a thousand troops, and occupied the vicinity of Zhangjia Village and Wujia Zhai. Our troops stationed in Miaohang rushed to fight, and a fierce battle broke out, with intense charges and melees. The stalemate at that location could not be broken. This afternoon, our reinforcements rushed to the scene and launched a fierce attack on our troops, repulsing the enemy.</p>
<p>According to reports, the enemy is building a parallel highway south of Baoyang Road and north of Yunzao Creek.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks Our Nansitang Position</h3>
<p>The front of our army's Chen Di position at Zhanghuabang Nansitang was attacked by the enemy at dawn yesterday, with fierce artillery fire. At the same time, the enemy troops launched a surprise attack on us with the main force from various places such as Heicunzhai, Shenjiazhai, and Xiaoxuzhai. After our army gave them a head-on blow, they all collapsed. The enemy's ambition did not die, and at noon, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, they drove three of their light tanks and attacked us from the vicinity of Xiaoxujiazhai. The sound of artillery fire did not stop until night. In addition, there were three enemy tanks that were active in our position for several hours, although they had entered Heiqiao Zhai. However, the infantry that followed behind the tanks were strafed by our machine guns, causing a large number of casualties. The tanks' response was ineffective, and they fled back in panic. Our defending troops suffered no damage.</p>
<h3>Enemy in Luodian Counterattacks Us</h3>
<p>On the Luodian front, the enemy facing our army has the appearance of attempting to counterattack us, in order to echo Yanghang. Yesterday afternoon, the enemy warships' artillery fire was unusually fierce, and there were more than a dozen aircraft in front of the tanks, covering their infantry, which launched a counterattack on our army's position between Pu Yangqiao and Yuepu from Linjiazhai, which is south of Zhenhua Creek and about two kilometers from Yuepu. The attack came fiercely, but our mouth division bravely responded to the battle, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties and collapsed to the rear.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, a small number of enemy troops were also discovered near Caowang Temple, our army's position, with the appearance of reconnaissance our army's position. Our army suddenly surrounded them and killed an enemy major. Many documents and maps were seized. At 5:00 AM this morning, the enemy used heavy artillery to bombard our Caowang Temple position non-stop for an hour. Seven or eight hundred enemy troops were discovered southeast of Liu River, attempting to advance, but were met with a head-on blow from our army, and the enemy retreated again.</p>
<h3>Enemy Builds Fortifications in Zhoujia Zhai</h3>
<p>In front of our army's position on Guanyintang Road in Hudong (north of Qiujiang Bridge on Jungong Road), there are enemy troops stationed near Zhoujia Zhai. They are building defense fortifications day and night, hoping to hold on. Our defending army's mouth brigade has long had strong defenses in that area, so although there have been occasional disturbances from a small number of enemy troops on that line, we have remained unmoved. According to reconnaissance reports yesterday, the enemies in the Zhoujia Zhai area seem to be a mixed formation of marine corps and regular army. There was a small conflict between the two sides yesterday morning. The marines led the way, followed by the army. After being attacked by our army, they collapsed in less than two hours, showing the weakness of their combat effectiveness.</p>
<p>Between Yucai Road and Tianbao Road in Hongkou, there are enemy troops stationed. According to the refugees who escaped from that area, the enemy troops have been in a panic in recent days, forcing nearby refugees to transport steel plates, sacks, and other military supplies to construct deep fortifications with shelters, and sending a small number of sentries to guard them. They are all wearing military uniforms and round steel helmets, and seem to be marine corps. Judging from their situation, they are not preparing to attack.</p>
<h3>Our Plane Bombs, Almost Hits Izumo</h3>
<p>At 0:20 this morning, our air force carried out a night raid on the enemy's position and bombed the enemy's warships in the Huangpu River, dropping a total of four bombs. Under the fear and panic, the enemy warships fired anti-aircraft guns indiscriminately. When our air force dropped the first bomb, someone observed with a telescope from the highest point of a foreign house on the Bund. When the first bomb was dropped, our plane sped down through the enemy warships' myriad sparks of anti-aircraft fire and bombed the Izumo warship. With a bang, it landed outside the starboard side of the warship, near the Pudong bank of the river, only a few feet from the Izumo's mid-cabin section. A fire and black smoke rose up, enveloping the entire enemy warship. Some soldiers inside the ship were killed or injured. After the bomb was dropped, our plane went to the Yangshupu area to bomb the enemy's position. After this bomb, the Izumo warship was already in a state of panic and dared not stay at Pier No. 2. Under the cover of two destroyers, it moved downstream. It was not until 6:00 AM this morning, after the enemy plane took off, that it moved back to its original location to anchor. Currently, there is only one enemy warship of the 30th team in front of the Central Pier. The enemy gunboat in front of the Chunjiang Pier has also lowered its anchor and moved away.</p>
<h3>Enemy Plane Bombs Longhua Temple</h3>
<p>50 to 60 Civilians Killed or Injured; North Bridge Elementary School Also Bombed</p>
<p>(Special report from this newspaper) At 9:30 AM today, five enemy planes flew to the Longhua area in southern Shanghai and bombed wantonly, dropping more than 20 bombs. The Longhua Temple and its surrounding areas were hit particularly hard. In addition to the partial destruction of the Arhat statues in the left wing of the temple, many civilian houses behind the temple were also destroyed. The police station of the nearby jurisdiction was also affected. 50 to 60 civilians were killed or injured. Police Chief Wang Biao and three policemen were seriously injured. Some of the seriously injured were taken to various hospitals in the special zone for treatment. Among them, Hua Lao Wu, 41 years old, a local, suffered a severe head injury; Xu Dixiang, 18 years old, a local, suffered a severe chest and right leg injury; Zhang Zuhai, 24 years old, from Shandong, suffered a minor right leg injury. The above-mentioned people were sent to Tongren Hospital, and the rest were sent to Shanghai West Zhongshan Hospital. Those who were killed on the spot were sent by Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Tang personnel to bury them. The residents of Longhua Town have all evacuated.</p>
<p>It is said that the enemy planes, not satisfied after killing residents, flew to the sky above North Bridge in Minhang and dropped seven or eight bombs. North Bridge Elementary School was also bombed. It is still necessary to investigate whether there were any deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>In addition, it is said that at about 9:00 AM today, four enemy planes bombed the Longhua Temple in southern Shanghai again, dropping nine bombs. The area at that time and the surrounding area were destroyed, and dozens of civilian houses were also affected. The Longhua Police Station, located on the west side of the temple, was also affected at the same time. One policeman was injured in the left waist by the bombing. More than 30 civilians were killed or injured. The West District Ambulance and the Shanghai Defense Corps were sent to Shanghai West Zhongshan Hospital for treatment. About 20 people were injured, and 12 or 13 people were killed. The Tongren Auxiliary Yuan Tang burial team collected the corpses and buried them. The reporter heard the news and drove to the scene. He saw the broken walls and ruins of the bombed temple. Fortunately, the four Heavenly Kings at the front gate of the temple and the Grand Hall of the Great Hero in the back were not affected. The golden and resplendent Buddha statues were slightly injured, but they were already speckled with marks. The 500 Arhats on the left side were also damaged. The limbs of the wounded civilians in front of the temple, broken arms and legs, were everywhere. Such a shocking and cruel tragedy is unbearable to witness.</p>
<h3>Landing in Pudong Still Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>The Japanese army's attempt to invade Pudong has shifted from passive action to gradually taking active action. Yesterday afternoon, after several fierce artillery battles between the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River and our Pudong troops, at 5:10 PM, they sent several small motorboats full of soldiers, using the fierce artillery fire on the ships as cover, and rushed to the new Mitsubishi Pier near Qichang Dock in Pudong, hoping to land on the shore. The sentry of a certain machine gun team of our side stationed at that location initially pretended not to see it. When their motorboats approached the pier, seven or eight Japanese soldiers were seen to disembark and test the waters, and they fired machine guns upward. Our army, taking advantage of their looking around, fired several machine guns in unison. The Japanese soldiers retreated to the boat in a panic, and several soldiers were injured. Then both sides used machine guns to fight fiercely. We were in a high position and were able to cope with ease. The enemy boat failed to cross the river and raised a flag to call for help. The enemy Li then released artillery fire to assist. The situation was tense for a while. Then our artillery team also bombed fiercely. Under the artillery fire, the enemy's motorboats were defeated and fled away quickly. In this battle, only one soldier on our side was hit by a shell and died of serious injuries. The serious situation then broke out again, the same as three days ago when the enemy boat's attempt to sneak across Chunjiang Dock was unsuccessful. The fierceness of the artillery battle shook the entire Shanghai. The enemy boat's second attempt to attack Pudong failed. The enemy soldiers' courage has been discouraged. Therefore, last night from dusk to morning, there was only intermittent artillery fire. The small boats patrolling the water surface never dared to approach.</p>
<h3>Our Troops on the Ping-Sui Line Advance to Guo Lei Zhuang</h3>
<p>Telephone Line Between Chai and Gui Repaired; Enemy Reinforcements on the Jinpu Line Arrive</p>

From the night of the 9th to noon on the 10th, artillery fire continued incessantly. However, the national army's positions were very solid. In addition to holding the fortified positions on the front, other units were dispatched to outflank from the left and right. The Japanese army, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and retreated. On the afternoon of the 10th, a large number of wounded Japanese soldiers were transported by eighteen heavy-duty vehicles from the Jinpu Line to Tianjin, and then transferred to trains bound for Tangshan. (Central News Agency dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to sources in transportation circles, more than 20,000 enemy troops arriving from Tanggu successively reached Tianjin by train on the night of the 9th. Most of them immediately went to Ping, while the rest were sent to the Jinpu Line as reinforcements.

<p>[Baoding] According to sources in transportation circles, the enemy on the Jinpu Line is still positioned between Machang, Beitangguantun, and Chenguantun on the front line. The enemy's left wing, including Ziyazhen and Wangqingzha, has been recovered by our army. The enemy is retreating from Bata towards Duliuzhen. Our guerrilla units have also outflanked the enemy, ambushing their retreat routes in places like Hanliushu and Dafankou in the suburbs of Tianjin. At the same time, due to river flooding, the Liangwangzhuang area is a vast expanse of water, and the enemy's rear has been cut off by our forces. Clear gunfire has been heard in places like Ruxia in the suburbs of Tianjin. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] According to sources, the Japanese army, with a large number of mechanized units, launched a fierce attack on our Machang positions on the morning of the 9th, with concentrated artillery fire that continued until nightfall.

<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee Discusses Japanese Aggression</h3>
<p>Our Representative Says There are Three Benefits; Various Countries Are in Contact Regarding Mutual Aid Measures</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the Sino-Japanese war being handled by the Advisory Committee established by the League of Nations General Assembly in 1933, Chinese sources here claim that there are three benefits to adopting this procedure: ㊀ The question of designating the aggressor nation can be resolved naturally without the need for discussion, since the League of Nations General Assembly unanimously recognized Japan as the aggressor nation in 1933. ㊁ The Sino-Japanese dispute can thus be automatically submitted to the current General Assembly of the League of Nations for handling, maximizing its effectiveness. ㊂ The United States, as a member of the Advisory Committee, can participate. In addition, the countries participating in the Mediterranean Conference are currently discussing the principle of mutual assistance, and the Western European countries are also making every effort to maintain collective security mechanisms. Therefore, China's appeal to the League of Nations is timely and cannot be more advantageous. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Conference Passes Regional Protection Measures</h3>
<p>The West Under the Responsibility of British and French Fleets; The East Under Russia, Greece and Turkey</p>
<p>⊙ Nyon, Switzerland The Mediterranean Conference opened at 4:10 PM today in the town hall. A horseshoe-shaped table was placed in the conference room, around which sat representatives from nine countries: Great Britain, France, Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Romania, Turkey, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. The Albanian government has not yet submitted a response, so its seat remains vacant. Germany and Italy have refused to participate, so seats were not reserved for their representatives. After the conference opened, a public meeting was held immediately. First, the mayor of Nyon, Schürch, delivered a welcome speech. Then, the proposal of British Foreign Secretary Eden was unanimously adopted to elect French Foreign Minister Delbos as chairman. After speeches by Delbos, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, and British Foreign Secretary Eden, the conference adjourned at 5:30 PM. A permanent technical committee was immediately formed to continue discussions, which lasted until 8:00 PM. It was decided to resume the meeting at 4:00 PM tomorrow.</p>
<p>A special dispatch from a Havas reporter: After today's meeting, it is reported that two decisions have been made: ㊀ The plan for warships from various countries to escort merchant ships in the Mediterranean Sea has been abandoned. ㊁ The British proposal in principle has been adopted, namely that the Mediterranean Sea be divided into eastern and western parts. The western part, from west of the British island of Malta, will be monitored by the British and French fleets. The eastern part, from east of Malta, will be monitored by the fleets of other participating countries.</p>
<p>Officials responsible for the Mediterranean Conference recently stated that the proposals put forward by the British and French governments were based on the idea of establishing safe zones in the Mediterranean Sea, prohibiting the passage of submarines, and having warships from various countries undertake monitoring. After discussions by the representatives of the various countries, it is reported that a compromise has been reached in principle. Although representatives from some countries have requested further clarification on the implementation methods, it is expected that the formal adoption will take place at 4:00 PM tomorrow, so that it can be implemented before the 20th of this month. According to this proposal, merchant ships of all countries must henceforth travel along designated routes, and warships of all countries can then protect them and provide assistance in the event of submarine attacks. The issue of preventing attacks by aircraft or transport ships (excluding submarines) will be discussed after the above proposal is adopted. The general approach is to dispatch aircraft carriers to patrol the Mediterranean Sea, so that when aircraft attack merchant ships of various countries, the aircraft carriers can dispatch aircraft to pursue them. In addition, regarding the British proposal to divide the Mediterranean Sea into eastern and western parts, the western part was originally to be monitored by the British and French fleets. It is now reported that the British and French governments will invite Italy to cooperate with them. However, if Italy refuses, the British and French governments will still maintain it independently. The eastern sea area will be monitored by the fleets of the Soviet Union, Greece, and Turkey, while Bulgaria and Romania will not participate. (Central News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Enemy Ships Bomb Dachan Pass</h3>
<p>Our Planes Fly to Humen to Reconnoiter and Bomb Enemy Ships; Japanese Consul in Guangzhou Has Left Hong Kong and Returned Home</p>

<h3>Casual Remarks</h3>
<p>— Phase</p>
<p>Yesterday, the 98th regular session of the League of Nations Administrative Council opened, and our government formally appealed to the League of Nations regarding Japan's repeated aggression against our country's territory and disruption of peace in East Asia. Some proponents of the uselessness of the League of Nations believe that the League's institutions are incompetent and unsound, which is already known to the world. Such appeals are like divination and prayer, and will not have any effect. However, this appeal to the League of Nations does not intend to seek help from the League of Nations, but rather to show great righteousness and administer heavenly justice to the world. First, our country is a member of the League of Nations, and the League of Nations should have the obligation to notify all member states when it meets. Second, this war against Japan is in fact self-reliant and does not seek help from others. It is necessary to make it known to all countries in the world for the sake of justice. Although the countries cannot impose factual sanctions on the aggressor, they will certainly be able to obtain a judgment of conscience.</p>

<h3>Enemy Navy Blockades the Coastal Situation in Southern China</h3>
<p>Shipping in Guangzhou and Shantou Ports Affected; Several Enemy Ships Moored in Waters off Chao-Shan</p>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: The Japanese army's announcement of a blockade of China's coastal ports has suddenly made the situation in Fujian and Guangdong tense. Since Fujian and Guangdong are close to the sea, coastal ports in Shantou, Shanwei, Dapeng Bay, and even Gaozhou, Leizhou and Qiongzhou, are all within Guangdong. Even foreign merchant ships entering and leaving Hong Kong will be subject to the Japanese fleet. Therefore, not only is business in Guangdong affected, but goods exported from Guangdong through Hong Kong are also hit. To guard against the Japanese army's reckless acts, British merchant ships and warships in Hong Kong have recently raised the British flag high on their ships, and the British coat of arms has also been painted on the roofs of British merchant ship docks in Guangzhou to prevent attacks by Japanese planes. Insurance companies in Hong Kong are experiencing booming business as people take out war insurance. To be prudent, cargo owners on the mainland are rushing to buy fire insurance to guard against the Japanese fleet. However, foreign insurance companies only accept insurance for goods on ships flying the British flag. Cargo owners must also declare the nature of the goods and the date of sailing. However, the insurance premium is slightly higher than usual. All insured goods are only effective during sailing. The insurance company is not responsible for losses incurred during landing. For safety, many cargo merchants have recently turned to British merchant ships for transportation. The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiyuan轮船 and others have long been suspended. However, one or two merchant ships from Guangzhou to Shanwei are still sailing, carrying cargo. Of the civilian ships in Guangdong, no fewer than three thousand sail daily. Among them, fishing boats and salt boats from Nan'ao, Shanwei, Shantou, and Aotou in the east, and Leizhou and Qiongzhou in the south, which transport goods and supplies, have been greatly alerted to prevent attacks by enemy ships after going to sea. It is heard that the Navigation Administration Bureau and the shipping company recently summoned representatives from the shipping guild and the civilian ship guild to discuss safe navigation measures in order to maintain shipping. Shantou dispatch: The Japanese navy's announcement of a blockade of the coast of southern China means several enemy ships often travel between Shantou and Xiamen along the coast of Fujian and Guangdong, mooring in the waters off Nan'ao Wokou and Chaoyang Dahao to measure the depth of the sea, and have not left for several days. Ships going to sea are also driven back to the port. Seeing that the situation overseas is not good, the Chaozhou Customs anti-smuggling ship Beidou voluntarily retreated into the port and has not dared to go out to sea for several days. The Dahao and Dayi vessels from Huanggang, fearing that they would be detained by enemy ships, turned back to Shantou en route and will not travel to coastal ports for the time being. The British company Jardine Matheson's vessels, such as the Haiyang, New Haimen, and Haitan, which run the Hong Kong-Shantou-Xiamen and Fuzhou lines, are still operating at the moment. Passengers going to Hong Kong are extremely crowded, and tickets are sold out two days in advance. Hundreds of people temporarily buying tickets are turned away each time. According to the Haiyang vessel, many Japanese ships were encountered on the Fujian and Guangdong waters. A Japanese ship was moored on the Mawei Nantai waters of Fuzhou. It was personally seen that the ship entered the inner harbor to capture fishing boats and barges. There were also two Japanese ships on the waters off Quanzhou, and two Japanese gunboats in front of Gulangyu in Xiamen, making the situation extremely serious. During the voyage, Japanese ships often use flickering lights to inquire. British ships answer with the same code. Japanese ships claim that if they do not clearly state the country of origin of the ship and which port it is going to, they will flash the stop-ship light three times in red. If they still do not stop for inspection, the Japanese ship will not be responsible in case of danger. The crew member also said that the Haiyang encountered two Japanese ships on the way from Xiamen to Shantou and was queried by flashing lights. The vessel answered in the same way and was not checked by the Japanese ships. If the situation becomes more tense in the future, whether British ships can still operate on the Hong Kong-Shantou-Xiamen-Fuzhou line is a question, and the company is discussing it.</p>
<p>On August 26th, the Japanese ships Sawayaka, Hayate, Asagao, and Karukaya were moored in the waters off Chaoyang Dahao. The people in the nearby villages were ordered by the Chaoyang County government to quickly evacuate to a safe area 60 li from the coast. Dahao has a road that leads to Jiaoshi and Wutian (the opposite shore of Shantou). Wutian is the main station of the Guangzhou-Shantou highway and is a very important place. That night, Japanese ships wanted to enter Mashi (Shantou port) and Haimen, but were stopped by our defense forces. The Japanese ships did not succeed, and on the 28th, three ships sailed elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Henan Province Gives Preferential Treatment to Soldiers on Expeditions</h3>
<p>Economic Assistance to Families in Poverty</p>
<p>Kaifeng dispatch: Henan Province is barren and impoverished, but the people are strong. Recruits from Henan account for the largest number of enlistees. The provincial government believes that since the War of Resistance Against Japan has already been launched, all soldiers from Henan are fighting for the nation and the race. Without preferential treatment, it will be impossible to encourage morale and eliminate the Japanese bandits. Special measures for preferential treatment of soldiers on expeditions have been drafted and announced on the 4th for implementation in various counties, and will be submitted to the central government for instructions to other provinces and cities to follow. The measures are as follows:</p>

Article 5: In addition to ordering them to bear the statutory taxes as usual, the county governments shall not apportion any temporary expenses to the families of soldiers on expeditions. Economic assistance should be provided to families in poverty.

<h3>North Xinjiang Flour Ship Destroyed by Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<h3>General Chiang Kai-shek Telegraphs Wang Xiaolai to Diligently Solicit National Salvation Bonds</h3>
<p>The Business Community Has Formed Fifty-Six Teams, Accumulating Over 350,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, the captain of the Shanghai business community's fundraising team, received a telegram yesterday from General Chiang Kai-shek, instructing him to diligently solicit donations. The telegram stated, "In order to enrich the national treasury and cope with the national crisis, the government is issuing national salvation bonds. The fundraising committee will appoint you gentlemen to handle the solicitation. In this extraordinary period, with your patriotic enthusiasm, leading the citizens and the business community, vowing to be a strong backing, the issuance of these bonds is crucial for national salvation and survival, and the hearts of the people are aligned. With your leadership and supervision, success will be achieved with half the effort. I hope you will work hard and make progress. This is my earnest expectation." Signed, Chiang Kai-shek, stationed in the capital. The association also issued a notice yesterday to various trade associations, stating, "Regarding the matter that the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Committee's letter states that in order to make the people universally support national salvation bonds, it has been decided that all companies should issue 25% of the national salvation bonds when distributing dividends and bonuses. We hereby request your association to inform all companies to add this clause to the fundraising methods and implement it accordingly." The association sent a corresponding letter notifying them to check and forward it to their respective industries, follow the methods, so that companies and shareholders can separately undertake the huge amount of bonds, and achieve the effect of collective effort. This is our sincere hope. It is heard that there are already 56 teams from various industries reporting to the association, including the hardware industry, the timber industry, and the woolen industry. The recent fundraising situation in Shanghai is briefly recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Free Professions Group of the National Salvation Bond Shanghai Citizens' Fundraising Headquarters had previously designated Wu Shu as the group director. According to this newspaper, it is now known that Pan Xulun and Xie Lin have been appointed as deputy directors. The accounting team of the group was established yesterday, with Xi Yushu appointed as the team leader, and Jiang Wanping, Quan Ding, and Tang Zaizhang as the deputy team leaders. Xu Yinghao is the secretary-general. The fundraising target is set at 60,000 yuan. The current subscribers include the Accountants Association (10,000 yuan), Pan Xulun (10,000 yuan), Xu Yongzuo (10,000 yuan), Xi Yushu (3,000 yuan), Jiang Wanping (1,000 yuan), Li Ding (2,000 yuan), Xu Yinghao and Tang Zaizhang (3,000 yuan), Shen Haifan (500 yuan), Wang Sifang (500 yuan), Shen Xuejun (500 yuan), Chen Yuemo (200 yuan), Qin Bo (400 yuan), Xia Sunhuan (500 yuan), Chen Xuelian (100 yuan), Huang Bingzhang (150 yuan), Chen Yiming (150 yuan), totaling 45,000 yuan. The remaining 15,000 yuan will be solicited within two weeks. The enthusiasm and efforts of the gentlemen of the Accountants Association are truly admirable. The other teams of the group are also actively fundraising.</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the National Salvation Bond Solicitation Team of the Shanghai Stationery and Office Supplies Trade Association, the fundraising director, Xie Jinchang, has assigned team members to solicit donations. The first batch of subscriptions from the industry includes Heji Educational Supplies Store and Shen Bisheng Factory (1,500 yuan each), Minsheng Ink Factory, Jincheng Industrial and Beida Feng Industrial Raw Material Company (1,000 yuan each), Minsheng Ink Factory staff, Dazhong Gold Pen Factory, Huafu Gold Pen Factory, Jinxing Fountain Pen Factory, Boshi Pen Factory, Xinji Binding Factory (500 yuan each), Modern Goods Store (300 yuan), Xinguang Educational Supplies Manufacturing Factory, Standard China Co., and Universal Educational Supplies Company (200 yuan each), Baoshan Crafts Factory, Li Gaoji Leather Ball Factory, Yihe Educational Supplies Store, Liwen Crafts Factory, China Stationery Company, and Xin Huisheng and Zhang Zhongying (100 yuan each), Wang Youjun and Zhou Hongming (50 yuan each), totaling 10,700 yuan. Including the first batch of subscriptions, it will reach 20,000 yuan. It is heard that Xie is still working hard to solicit donations.</p>

At that time, the Youth Association National Salvation Bond Team was established, and team leader Lu Ganchen solicited donations from various members, raising 100,000 yuan, which has been reported to the headquarters.</p>
<h3>Repatriation and Relief News</h3>
<p>Repatriation</p>
<p>The members of the Coal Ash Trade Association have provided transportation and manpower to assist the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in transporting condolences and supplies to the frontline soldiers, which has been highly praised by the frontline soldiers. Recently, due to the complete shutdown of the industry and many employees volunteering to return to their hometowns, a repatriation team has been specially formed. The association provides its own vehicles and transports them to Hangzhou, Wuxi, and other places via the Shanghai-Jiading public road once a day. Employees and relatives of the industry can register with the association first and then take the bus. If there are any remaining seats, they can take fellow villagers from Hangzhou and Shaoxing, but they must contact the association on the 5th floor of the Silk Industry Bank on Sanma Road, phone number 90083.</p>
<p>Relief</p>
<p>In order to assist refugees, the China International Famine Relief Commission has allocated 4,000 yuan of national currency to the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Relief Refugee Joint Committee, 2,000 yuan each to the Shanghai Relief Committee and the Chinese Medical Association, and 1,000 yuan each to the Shanghai Christian Federation and the International Relief Association, totaling 10,000 yuan, to be used for relief work.</p>
<p>The Taigaobao Fellow Villagers' Association Joint Office is actively carrying out relief work for fellow villagers. In addition to setting up shelters in Shanghai, due to the fierce fighting in Luodian and Liuhe, many fellow villagers have been affected. Temporary shelters have been set up in safer areas, such as Penglong Town in Tai, Qipu, and Zhujiajiao.</p>
<p>According to the工部局 statistics on the 9th, the卫生处 of the 公共租界 has inspected 117 refugee shelters, housing a total of 60,595 refugees.</p>
<h3>Reopening of Public Welfare Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Workers Return to Work</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai battle, all factories have been closed. Yesterday, the British-owned Public Welfare Yarn Factory on劳勃生路 in沪西, due to its relatively safe location, officially reopened at 6:00 am. However, night work has not yet resumed, so the factory's more than 1,000 day and night workers are divided into two shifts, alternating every five days. Yesterday, 527 male and female workers entered the factory to work.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Anti-Enemy Association Comforts Frontline Soldiers</h3>
<p>Receives Letter of Thanks from Military Headquarters; Rear Lacks Motor Vehicles</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Shanghai battle, the Shanghai West Caojing District Anti-Enemy Support Association has had the ○○ Division of our army arrive, and the association hired coolies to assist in transportation with all its might. When the division's troops set off for the front line to fight bravely against the enemy, the association continued to provide all the necessary supplies. Knowing that our army was fighting bloody battles in the defense areas in the city center, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy, the association admired the loyal and brave soldiers who sacrificed themselves to defend the country and repeatedly made meritorious achievements. Therefore, it specially purchased 10,000 fresh quail eggs and sent them to the front to express its respect. A letter of thanks has now been received from the military headquarters, briefly informing the operational process of our army and the lack of motor vehicles in the front. This shows the intensity of the battle between our army and the enemy. The original letter is excerpted below: (Omitted above) After our army passed through your territory, we were deeply grateful for all the assistance in transportation and supplies. Now, we have received 10,000 eggs as a comfort to our army, which shows your association's enthusiasm for saving the country and caring for the soldiers, and further increases our inspiration. In addition to distributing the relief supplies to the medical team for the exclusive use of the wounded soldiers, and informing all officers and soldiers of our army, we hereby represent all officers and soldiers to express our gratitude. Furthermore, since joining the front line, our army has been fighting bloody battles against the enemy without rest. The Japanese pirates have suffered many casualties, and our army has also suffered heavy losses. However, our rear is facing difficulties in providing transportation, hygiene, and rescue due to the lack of motor vehicles (Omitted below).</p>

<h3>Reasons for Postponing School Opening in the Special District</h3>
<p>In the First and Second Special Districts, most public and private schools have postponed the opening of classes due to the intense fighting and numerous stray bullets in recent days, in order to ensure the safety of students. Even the schools that have already opened have few students and will be temporarily suspended. Classes will resume after the Social Bureau issues an order.</p>
