<p>時評</p>
<h3>中日經濟提携前途都</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>中日經濟提携之呼聲。自兒玉謙次考察團蒞華以後。一時復有甚嚴塵上之勢。排日宴會。循序酬酢。觥籌交錯。賓主俱歡。蓋自瀋變迄今。武力澎漲。兵氛瀰漫。兩國友誼。不絕如縷。何幸得此一行工商領袖。以純粹國民之立塲。負實地調查之使命。循是以圖經濟提携之促進。謀兩國關係之調整。機綠所在。誠意隨之。改弦易轍。原非難事。我以酷愛和平之民族。寗有不表衷懷之歡迎者。今兒玉等在滬任務已告終了。業於日昨啟程回日。將以茲行結果。歸報於其國人。關於經濟提携是否獲得光明之開展。中日關係能否轉入平穏之坦途。當為國人所極端縈切者。試就管見。一推論之。</p>
<p>我國以地大物博馳稱於世。山林蘊蓋之充牣。淵產礦藏之豐饒。俱有足以自給而給人者。祇以連年俶擾。積困莫蘇。技術資力。並付闕如。遂至大量材富。聽其沉湮。設有友邦人士。來謀合作。楚才晋用。共謀開發。吾人固當張其兩臂。以相迎致。唯此際有一必應遵守之原則。卽互惠平等一語是已。平等所以維主權於勿墜。互惠卽在增雙方之福利。常人受託。尚知斯義。矧在國際。寗容忽略。英大使許閣森。於出席港西南會宴會席上。曾謂唯平等方能謀中英間之友好。吾人極願以合作精神助其發展。殆能深明此中出入。故不覺其慨乎言之。而兒玉謙次於其登程來華之先。亦有極墾摯之談話。一則曰。在政治上堅决尊重中国之领土與主權。再则曰。在經濟上嚴格保持兩國之互惠與平等。蓋唯此。方足以言提携。亦唯此。方足以期兩國關係之改善也。我之嚶嗚以求。如此其殷切。人之推誠相與。如彼其透澈。則於一度周旋之下。宜無不可以凑拍浃洽者。顧自兒玉抵滬以來。日方空氣頗陷悲觀。報紙論調。尤多不滿。而兒玉發表監別聲明。亦若抑然不能盡其辭者。斯又易為而然者耶。</p>
<p>吾人當知。在京滬團體正以熱烈情緒歡迎日考察團之際。在兒玉謙次正以雍容態度致其親善演說之頃。而他方所反映於行動事實者則如何。軍部壘開會議。幕僚武官。奔波接洽。此一現象也。浪人頑強走私。關員被毆。站夫受傷。此又一現象也。誰實為之。誰實縱之。以一元化外交為號召。而實際之乘戾如是。宜亦兒玉輩所難以釋然者乎。善夫考察團員加藤在津之言曰。“所以未能打開僵局原因。華北問題。自屬其一。本團歸國後。當基於所得情况。掬誠宣告國人。应顧及實際情形。妥善處置對華政策”是知中日經濟提携之前途。将视兒玉考察团返國後之努方如何為轉移。吾人今日固無所用其喋喋矣。</p>
<h3>日本林首相將邀黨員入閣</h3>
<p>任鐵道拓務專任大臣　政黨軍部空氣已和緩</p>
<p>［東京］現內閣之文部。鐵道•拓務•三相席今仍虛懸、聞文部大臣仍將由首相林銑十郎兼任、其餘二省專任大臣、俟國會於三十一日閉會後、卽將由民政黨與政友會遴選之、當林銑十朗組閣之時、因鑑於政黨與軍部間之敵對、故曾拒絕政黨黨員入閣、但自結城出任大藏大臣與池田接充日本銀行總裁後、林內閣已被認為財閥軍閥互相抱合之內閣、此種精神、自然亦反映於政黨之態度、議會開會期間、民政黨與政友中若干黨員、雖曾個人提出激烈之質問、然兩黨對政府所提出之各種重要議案、實際上已予以擁護、兩星期前、林首相曾表示意見、謂軍部與政黨間在組閣時之敵對、已大見和緩、此卽暗示邀講政黨黨員充任虛懸之相席、惟林銑十郎被時仍希望新政黨、卽各方面所醞釀組織之政府黨、卽可出現、俾在其中遴選專任大臣、最近雖然不少政友會與民政黨黨員進行組織新黨運動、但因在議會獲得多數議席之希望甚鮮、其實現遂致耽擱、據聞林首相現決從現存兩黨中、遴選鐵道與拓務兩省之專任大臣、以减少在議會閉會後、草擬新而較強之政策過程中、所可發生之衝突也、（二十八日中央社電）</p>

<p>［東京］貴族院於本日上午十時半開會、政府提出發行昭和十二年追加公債之法律案及日本銀行買金法中改正法案、由結成藏相說明理由後、付託赤字公債委員會、其次提出防空法案、河原田內相說明理由、公正會淺田良逸提出質問四項、卽第一、政府為何不令一般人負航空義務、第二、軍部有無指揮民間防空之意、又於一旦有事之際、有意徵發民間航空乎、第三、平時防空與戰時防空、其指揮與監督有不同點乎、第四、編成防空僅以內務大臣之監督滿足乎、</p>
<p>河原田內相答謂、現在對一般國民施行訓練、但不強制、本法案限於有特種技能者負義務、凡不屬於軍部之防空、均由本法管理、將來設立防空省、則統轄防空事業、晢時由內務省統轄、而與各縣機關連絡、以斯萬無遺憾、</p>

<h3>美國實行巨艦大砲政策</h3>
<p>戰鬥艦裝十六時口徑砲　英美認日本態度不足異</p>
<p>［華盛頓］據今日正式公佈消息、美國將於今夏開始建築戰鬥艦二艘、裝置十六時口徑重砲、現美國巨艦之裝有十六時口徑之重砲者、已有三艘、卽曼麗倫號•考羅拉度號•及西浮基尼亞號、至日本最近之正式拒絕十四時砲位之限制、此間認為毫不足異、但亦無正式之評論發表、（中央社二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］此間海軍權威、對於新建二戰艦之砲口徑問題、殊守秘密、並不願於日本正式通知拒絕限制砲口徑至十四時以前、作何批評、惟稱、海軍部如不用十六吋口徑之大砲九門、卽用十四時口徑者十二門、分為三排、每排四砲、此係新發明之建造法、據悉海軍官員贊成用十四時口徑之大砲、以减輕重量、並增加行駛力量、惟該二艦設計之時、卽僅擬有二十七海里之速率、故海軍部或將採用十六時口徑之天砲、亦未可知云、（廿七日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］日本政府頃已照會英國政府拒絕主力艦砲位十四時口徑之限制、但尚無照會送達此間、海軍界人士因東京方面早有消息傳來、稱日本現擬建造三萬五千噸以上乃至五萬噸之主力艦、並裝置十六時口徑之大砲、因此聞訊不以為異、最近海軍當局曾就三萬五千噸主力艦裝置十六時大砲一層、加以研究、結果發現其射程與十四時大砲、相差不多、而後者則較為輕便、以故海軍專家均贊成十四時之砲徑云、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］關於英法美三國海軍條約所規定主力艦砲位口徑十四時之限制問題、日本政府已向英國提出照會、拒不接受此項限制、英國海軍界人土頃評論此事、追述海軍大臣霍爾爵士日前在下議院所發表之宣言、並謂三萬五千噸之主力艦、裝置十四時口徑大砲、足以節省艦身重量、並可加厚鐵甲、而使主力艦抵抗砲火之力量、為之加強、反之、砲位口徑一旦加大、則鐵甲勢必减薄、其抵抗砲火之力量、自亦感受影響、此乃英國贊成十四時砲徑之理由、特据日本方面消息、該國海軍部現擬建造三萬五千噸以上之主力艦、果爾、則英國亦當建造三萬五千噸以上之主力艦、並裝置十六時口徑之大砲云、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］海軍部今日宣布、英國已着手建造一千六百五十噸驱逐艦十六艘、速率為三十六海里、據稱、艦上將裝置六時與四•七時口徑之砲、其中八艘為一九三六年建造計劃之一部、其餘則屬本年度計劃、兩年內添建驅逐艦四十艘之計劃、已經核准、（廿七日國民電）</p>
<h3>美工人要求承認工會</h3>
<p>政府不干涉工潮</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統在溫泉休假二星期、今日已返至白宮、準備卽刻與國會領袖討論勞工問題、並將與參衆兩院之司法委員舉行會議、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］參院民主黨領袖羅炳生、今日與羅斯福總統會商後、在此發表一文、說明中央政府對於國內罷工事件之態度、謂目前留廠怠工事、中央政府不便干涉、蓋根據憲法、苟未發生㊀傷毀中央資產㊁破壞中央法律、㊂州當局請求援助以維持法紀與治安等事、則中央政府未有干涉罷工之權也、今旣無此種發展、而工潮情勢且已大有進步、故尤無于涉之必要云、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統在喬治亞州溫泉休憇兩星期之後、頃已返京、當卽與國會各領袖相接洽、本日與之會晤者、計有衆議院議長彭海德、該院民主黨領袖雷本、參議院議長卽副總統加納、該院民主黨領袖羅炳生、總統並會與勞工部長裴金女士、討論工潮問題、關于此事總統無意提出新法案、政界人士對于罷工工人盤踞廠屋情事、則甚為注意、若干眾議員、并因各州現行法律、參差不齊、擬請聯邦國會通過新法案、以資劃一、但一般人仍恐最高法院、或以侵犯各州立法權為口實、而認為違反聯邦憲法、舉國人土、因而集中視綫于總統前所提出之最高法院改組法案、以為𨥏底抽薪之計、關于此層、官塲人士頃宣稱、總統寗願靜候全國與論、作一鮮明表示、不欲催促國會提付討論云、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>底得律　美國汽車工業“靜坐罷工”風潮中、最近之發展、為汽車業工會之請求法庭、令克萊斯勒工廠承認該工會為與僱工談判之惟一交涉團體、蓋根據華格納勞工關係法所規定、在任何工廠中、凡僱員中工會會員人數佔大多數者、卽可為工人惟一代表機關、聯合汽車業工會員佔克萊斯勒廠僱工之絕對多數、故遂根據該法、要求法院訓令克萊斯勒廠不得違犯也、但美國最高法院對于華格納法本身之是否合法、尚在考盧之中、（中央社二十七日路透電）</p>
<h3>馬來工潮可獲解决</h3>

<p>吉隆坡　馬來罷工現有總解决之好氣象、巴杜亞蘭煤礦華工六千人、在成立加資什一之協定後、今日已多數復工、星期五日發生衝突後、調往该處之軍隊、明日可望撤回、尼格里西比兰橡皮塲之罷工者、多已表示願在警察保護下恢復工作、（二十八日中央社電）</p>

<h3>不干涉西班牙內戰海陸監察計畫漸見效</h3>
<p>英法海軍準備為後盾　法艦首次截獲志願兵</p>
<p>［倫敦］法國外交部長台爾博斯曾於本月二十五日與英國駐法大使克勒克爵士進行談話、互相說明英法兩國目前對於西班牙內亂不干涉問題所應採取之立塲、並磋商各項措置、俾遇外國志願兵續行開往西班牙時、得由英法兩國海軍加以攔截、勿令在該國登陸、但此間一般人認為海軍行施監察辦法、其任務應僅以證明不干涉協定被破壞之事買為限、而不宜遽卽出於攔截行為、以免引起嚴重事端、兩國當局本日復積極磋商、據聞已就下列四點商得同意、卽</p>
<p>㊀英法兩國對於西班牙問題、意見並無參差之處</p>
<p>㊁關於不干涉協定現被破壞一節、此際並無何項消息、足以使人絕對相信其為不訛、</p>
<p>㊂但他日若果證明不干涉協定確被破壞、則英法兩國常認為此項局勢“極端嚴重、”</p>
<p>㊃英法兩國學賡續不斷交換意見云、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］茲據倫敦有力方面見解、不干涉委員會禁止志願兵赴西班牙協定成立之後、各國尚無違犯條文之事實發生、至謂某某國意圖破壞、亦不可信、監察委員會現已開始工作、使協定發生效力、而英法雙方並擬竭力使其工作在最短時間中見其效果、故對於禁阻志願兵赴西班牙、目前尚無採取其他步驟之必要、亦無何項建議云、（中央社二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］半官機關意大利日報頃載稱、意國政府曾於日前就該國對於西班牙問題所採態度、向英國提供保證、謂意國絕無派遺軍隊前往西班牙之意、上項保證、英國內閣前於本月二十四日舉行閣議時、業已知悉、翌日法國外交部長台爾博斯接見英國駐法大使克勒克爵士、向其建議、由英法兩國合作、以阻止外國志願兵開往西班牙、但英國未予接受、卽此故也云、按一般人以為意大利日報所述保證、當係意國外交部長齊亞諾伯爵於本月二十二日會見英國大使德魯蒙爵士時、向該大使所提出者、（中央社二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］此間意國大使館某發言人今日否認意國曾重向英國保證、不再派兵至西班牙、並鄭重聲稱、根據國際中立協定、意國早已禁止軍隊赴西班牙、倘另有保證、卽將令人疑惑意國以前之禁令、並無誠意、此點應當辯明、英國官塲已證實意國之否認、謂“每日電報所稱、意國曾向英國保證、禁止志願兵赴西班牙、並表示已準備討論撤退西班牙叛軍行伍中之外籍軍隊云、實屬𪮝造事賓、同時據悉、意相墨索里尼訓令駐英大使格蘭弟、拒絕討論撤退已在西班牙之志願軍一事、現在並無改變、今日意國使館發言人亦稱、格氏氣絕討論此項問題、已造就目前之給果、惟至二星期或一月之後、或尚可討論、意國已遵守協定、禁止軍隊赴西班牙、英國並無理由、可以設想意國欲破壞不干涉協定云云、倫敦時報評論此事、殊多諷刺、該報謂現在意國另有志願兵整裝待發、已無人不知、故此間皆覺羅馬已破壞中立協定、孟却斯德保衛報亦有類似之表示、謂“現在西班牙之戰事、早已非為內戰、地中海西部將來之地位已成問題、而此點卽為危機所在”云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］今日有法國戰艦一艘正式用武力實施不干涉協定、阻止志願兵赴西班牙、被阻止者為一法國商船、該船載有志願乓二十五人、其中有美國人數名、法國戰艦得悉之後、卽向該船發砲、勒令駛返望特萊港、以志願兵交警察看管、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<h3>滄縣事件經過真相</h3>

<h3>秋春</h3>
<p>— 周亮超</p>
<p>動“戶樞不蠧，流水不污，常“動”故也。”這幾句話是給我們一個復扼要的啟示，就是說，“動”與人生是相依為命的：“動”就是人生，人生須得“動”；不“動”，非但無人生可言，簡直不是人！</p>
<p>可是在一切“動”的方式下面，却存在着“得”與“失”的分歧；“動”的有步驟，有意義，有價值，社會入羣受你“動”的影響而獲福利的效益，這是“得”；“動的很卑鄙的沒紀律，一味自私，幹着破壞，欺詐，哄騙，搗亂，橫蠻，……的勾當，這是“失”。所以我們不“動”則已，如果希冀自己在“動”的過程中，要給寶貴的生命灌漑肥美的養料使開出燦爛的花朶的話，那未，我們站在“得”與“失”的分歧關頭的當兒，就得立定脚跟，用我們精锐的目光，堅忍的意志，百折不撓的精神，披荊斬棘的勇氣，向着認定的目標，邁步前進。這樣，“動”的結果，會給你勝利的微笑的慰藉，各則，“動”在驅策你開掘埋葬自己的墳墓，給你一個毀滅，休得超生！</p>
<p>所以我們不要認為“我們具有施展‘動’左右‘動’的權力的自由”，要曉得我們每一個人的生命的得失，却操纵在“動”的掌握中。</p>
<p>我的结论是：要活就得“動”，無益的蛮“動”，是“行屍走肉”的“動”態，“神出鬼沒”的醜“動”；握着熊熊不息的火把，去幹復與民族的任務，這才是我們正義的“運動”</p>
<h3>衣鈕</h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>衣紐，在婦女們的外衣上，如旗袍之类上面，雖然，似乎僅只處於附屬品的地位，然而從美的立場上瞧來，却也是不容忽视的。最近，我新聽着一位新裝師的敎益。他說，衣鈕之於衣服，正如一個人的臉上所生的眉毛。雖然眉毛的地位，總是固定的，然而娘兒們的眉毛，有着柳條式的，鐵綫式的，蛾眉式的，鳳尾式的，以至於嘉賓式的，克萊拉賓式的，至不一致。總之，是因着各人面部的轮廓，而各異其式樣，以增加其美麗。衣鈕一物，也是如此。雖然在衣服上的地位，是固定的，然而疎密長短，也須依各人的身材而互異，以求其諧和。同時，更須顧及衣料的色澤，花紋等等，而力求衣鈕的圖案的相襯。若能在各方面，都相諧和，那麼，也必能如娘兒們臉上的眉毛，愈增着容藐的嫵媚。若是二襲很好的旗袍上，配上了不相諧和的衣鈕，那正如一個娘兒的美麗的面龐上，配上着二道板刷眉，大殺風景。</p>
<p>查我國姨兒門，注意到着衣鈕的重要，在實際上，還不過是近十年來之事。在十年之前，旗袍尚未盛行，一般衣鈕，都是做的所謂直脚钮。若是有人裝上了一套圖案簡單的盤香鈕，已算是十分講究的了。然而衣服的式樣，以及衣料的色彩等等，與衣鈕圖案的是否諧和，是根本沒有注意到的。在這十年中，婦女愛美的程度，是有着長足的進步，所以在這十年中，衣鈕的圖案，以及檔數的疏密，在旗袍上，已是極盡着變化之能事。一般摩登娘兒們，當裁製一件新裝時，對於衣鈕一物，也往往的與新裝師磋議着，而費盡心機的設計。據找所認識的那位新裝師說，這倒並不是全無意義的事，因為衣鈕一物，若能設計週詳，是儘足以取花邊的地位而代之的。在這圖案綫條，力求單純化的年頭兒，一襲旗袍上，僅具着右方一列簡單图案的衣钮，是挺足以表示其雅緻而大方，比了裝上綫條呆滯的花邊，正不知美觀若干倍呢。然而就這一個和諧簡單，而合於時代的衣鈕，據那位新裝師說，在設計時，已就是够使人费着不少的心血的了</p>
<h3>冠農之游</h3>
<p>— 毓雋</p>
<p>春來偶感小恙，緾綿病楊，不覺月餘，大好春光，未免辛負，一昨睛朗，忽動游興，爰附街車，止於滬西漕河涇之冠生園農塲。是日適逢星期，以是游侶甚盛，衣香髪形，踵趾相接，望梅軒前，宋梅一樹，幹枝古拙，着花盈顛，色微綠，迥异凡俗，颇見雋妙，視其標簽，為前年移自杭州花園岡者，據謂係宋康王御園古物，愈益珍貴矣。</p>
<p>彌望園中，樹頭新綠，柳已吐蕊，清風微度，着盧和順，不覺春氣盎然矣。環游一周，淪茗于綠蔭草堂，坐甫定，晤園主洗君，遂與寒喧移時，且導觀魚樂國，沙缸數百，錦鱗萬千，蔚為大觀，洗君告…魚自解凍，已進食物，今歲天時和暖，魚腹都已便便，再逾一二旬，卽須追尾散子矣。上年仲冬，嘗過揚州，曾參觀三和罐頭食品公司主人梁君斯蓄之名魚，魚都碩大，種亦名貴，有“珍珠”數對，長七八寸，珠大如荳，粒粒可數，歡為觀止。且觀彼處藝魚之水，澄清見底，魚游其中，鱗紋悉現，曾詢之梁，梁曰，此為北法，北人藝魚水尚清，故魚身可觀，不若南人之嘉用綠水也。且水之清綠，與魚身無關，而吾人於清水觀賞，則不勞撈取之煩矣。洗君頗善其說，遂商之梁，乞物色一北人魚奴，頃已來園，故此間之缸水，亦可一覽無遺矣，愚視之果然，歸而記之，以告愛好藝魚者。</p>

<h3>換巢鸞鳳</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　白板釘笺空還兩行淚荻花楓葉獨步半城秋</p>
<p>端莊之間，兀自帶了一分媚態。小松見國器看到這女學生，似乎有占羞澀之狀，突然的將步子走緩了。這就聯想到那幾有詩所說的人，不要就是這位吧？在種種揣測，不會完全停止的時候，那位小姐，已是走到了面前。他倒並不是豫詩十所說的羞人答答，反是很大方的同人站定，對國器笑着點了一個頭，又低聲叫了一句表兄。國器對於人家這樣大方的表示，當然也是以大方還禮，隨着點了個頭，兩下交錯而過。小松等他走得去遠了，才笑道：原來是你的令親。國器道：對了。但是很疏遠的，我們不大來往。小松心想，誰又問了你來往不來往呢？二人默然着走了幾步，到了卷口。小松道：你還是上道有事呢？還是送我呢？國器道：送你幾步。小松道：那可以止步了。你回去把那詩多寫幾首，下次我再來領敎罷。國器心裏也就想着，刚才李友梅女士走過，必是到自己家裏去了。自從那次他誤會過以後，大概是很有點害臊，始終不曾來過。女孩子面皮薄，當然在男子以上，自己還是回家去招待，招待，把這段痕跡給遮掩過去。於是忽忽的走回家來，以為友梅必在母親屋子裏，故意借了些事端進去，裏面却是無客。默念着，他是那樣不避嫌疑，又到自己一書房裏去了。自己也穩定了態度，掀開開廉緩緩進去。也以為這樣的從容與措，總不至於去驚動他的。可是走進去一看，屋子裏還是不見人。這奇了，難道他是過門而不入。唉！無意之中，又算負了一個人。於是拿了那張詩稿，自捧着斜靠在椅子背上，緩緩的吟詠了起来。耳邊下却聽到玻璃窗砰砰的有人敲着響。国器回頭着時，一張粉白的臉閃了一閃，笑道：這不是李小姐。友梅在外面點了兩點頭，笑道：我早就來了。可是看到表哥送了客出去，我也不知這表哥什麼時候回來，所以在巷裏子打了幾個轉身。見你進了門我才來的。你又在作詩，我來得不嫌冒昧一點嗎。（一五○）</p>
<h3>人間可哀錄㈠</h3>
<p>— 周瘦鵑</p>
<p>中華民國二十六年三月十七日，三見榕以自由車遊小園中，墮池而殞。愚與室人鳳君，遘茲慘變，心碎魂飛，淚乾聲咽；竊龍其年肖汪踦，死非國殤，天實為之，謂之何哉！茲距吾榕兒之殤，忽忽經旬矣：感物傷懷，不能自已，筆之於書，藉洩吾哀。</p>
<p>榕兒字仲美，行三，肄業東吳初中二年級。天資雖不甚慧，而頗知勤讀；性愻順，在家能孝其父母，在校能得師長歡，諸同學亦多與之暱。好美術，十二齡時，卽喜奏刀刻石作名鈐；工勞作及繪事，楚楚可觀。尤愛童子軍工作，結繼旗語烹調縫紐靡不能；邑中露管檢閲，幾於無役弗與。年不足十六，而頎碩如二十外人，與愚及乃兄，衣履均可互易。老母年七十矣，見其長成如許，顧而樂之。又安知一彈指頃，天遞攫吾愛兒以去耶！</p>
<p>十七日午后，愚方在館治筆政，三時許，陡覺刺促不寧，亟欲返蘇，因以四時特別快車行，於六時許驅車寗家，陡見鳳君號眺門外，謂榕兒墮水；愚驚悸亡魂，疾趨入聞，則榕兒已由傭僕輩援起，方伏花丁肩頭，吐水如潮。愚尚以為可救，亟命延李廣動醫師與搏習醫院許醫師來，針以救命之針，施以人工呼吸：愚復親為接氣，半續其命。詎人工難敵天工，天旣堅欲驚召兒，非人力所能撓救，蓋榕兒出水以後，久已怛化矣。愚力抱其首，狂呼榕兒不置，而兒默不吾應。兒雖橫死，面目如生，安然作入腄狀；遍體亦不浮腫，肌肉堅實如生前。嗟夫嗟夫，吾奚忍目覩此十餘年心血之結晶，竟盧擲於鳥乎有之鄉耶！時老母適以事覊滬，數日始歸，已不及見愛孫一面，日夕跌足長號，頻呼榕兒之名，老懷之抑塞可知已。</p>
<p>榕兒入殮之日，為十八日，午后將殮，風雨交非，兩脚髟髟然，一若天亦為之下淚者；而哥榕兒遂於此悽風苦雨中行矣。茲擬於清明節後，卜葬繡谷公墓，從此遠離骨肉，獨眠靈嚴山下，風晨月夕，誰與為歡？但願由靈發大慈悲，阿護此幾獨可憐之兒，勿為厲鬼所侮也。</p>
<p>榕兒此次慘選意外，似有先兆。十六夜十時許，家人均先就寢。愚獨坐燈下編“春秋”，忽見榕冉冉下牀，直趨外室；愚驚詢所以，榕謂欲覓一書，愚以為夢魘，亟扶之歸寢，撫其額，溫溫如平時，榕目愚微笑，貼然復睡，愚亦弗以為意也。及其旣死，大兒錚檢點遺物，則見其日常所用之犀飛利墨水筆。已固對密紉，似已預知其行將橫死，從此無所用之者。又據其同學某君言：是日午后，榕在校中作文，一揮而就，狀至忽促；叩其故，則謂中心麻亂，急欲歸去。詎歸後一小時，遂及於難。鳴呼，此中殆眞有天耶！</p>
<h3>翡翠</h3>
<p>— 南宮生</p>
<p>翡翠是一種礦石，生於我國西南各省。在未剖解之前，是一塊很大的山石，表皮是深黃色的，石內便蘊藏省碧綠的翡翠。叮是翡翠商人，在購買翡翠石的時候，非老於此道，有深切的眼光不可。因這時並不能將石塊剖開，研究石內翡翠的蘊藏量如何。所以只可憑著眼光和幸運，倘是到得了一塊翡翠多而透綠的山石，便不難致富，反之，便虧損了。因此翡翠商人，因買翡翠石而發財的，和傾家的，都時有所聞。</p>
<p>最好的翡翠石，名宕心綠。這塊山石，從外面去了表皮，便有碧綠的翡翠，一直到了石心，越到裏面，越是綠而透明，差不多完全的翡翠，自然是最好的翡翠石了，可惜數百塊翡翠石內，很少的可以得到一塊。其餘的翡翠石，大都是生翠不多。在一塊石內，只要有五寸方的一方玻璃翠，已足以得到極多的盈餘了。</p>
<p>對於翡翠石的剖解，也有專門學識，老於剖解翡翠的人，可以把翡翠很完全的剖解出來，整塊而不零碎。所以到得了一塊翡翠石，必須經過技師的指示，方可以不受意外的損害。</p>
<p>翡翠的珍貴，便在綠色的優劣，和色澤光彩的明暗。品質的高低，也在這兩點上分別。好的翡翠，碧綠而透明，如綠玻璃相同，因此喚作玻璃翠。倘是綠色較淡而暗，便為次貨了。顏色如湖綠而不透明的，是最劣的一種。翡翠之內，如有了黑點，或是白的紋路，也不是好的一種。但是有一種翡翠，顏色旣綠，又透明如玻璃，翠內却很均穩的佈滿着黑星，名呌梅花綠，又是珍貴的一種，因這是罕見的佳品。</p>
<p>翡翠的用處，只有作為飾物，也是裝飾品而已。近世最通行的，便是戒指，手鐲，以及錶梗，鈕扣等物。也有將翡翠雕成玩具和陳列品的，如玉展的翡翠寶塔，便是陳列品的一種。</p>
<h3>笑話連篇</h3>
<p>— 笑林</p>
<p>阿劉生了紅眼睛，怕見亮光，常流淚水，他也沒有醫治。有一天他到親戚家裏上賀喜，因為見了亮光，淚水又流下來。他的姊夫便打趣的對他說：“在做喜事的地方，你為甚麽要哭呢？”這話說得阿劉非常難為情，他趕忙分辦道：“我那裏是哭，我是因眼痛流淚呀。”於是姊夫又正色的說道：“旣然有眼病，就該點用五洲藥房的“明眼藥水”，眼病也就可以早愈了。</p>
<p>烟琮沒有戒</p>
<p>政府戒烟，雷厲風行，所以趙老板也戒掉他的烟癮，他很得意的對他的朋友誇他自已有决斷，可是朋友却不信他把烟戒掉，原來他的一付齒牙，還是黑得照舊。後來他得悉有種“一三一”牙膏，含着藥劑功效，能够白齒除污、購用之後，果然黑色漸退，清潔美觀了。</p>

<h3>世運籌委大鬧意見</h3>
<p>▲東京市長與體協會成對立狀態</p>
<p>▲市長牛塚藐視競技部長鄕隆氏</p>
<p>▲四百卅萬補助金衆議院已通過</p>
<p>（東京特訊）第十二次世界運動大會日本政府補助金問題、為此間當局、體育協會及世運籌備委員會日來最憂慮之焦點、二十日衆議院預算總會提出追加預算案、政友會河野一郎、民政黨勝田永吉、首相林銑十郎兼攝文相（教育部長）、河源文部次官、各方面有尖銳化之質閒、各方爭論良久、終於通過政府補助金四百三十萬元、一大難關、至此始算通過、林首柑宣稱日本籌備世運、當以國家性之事業籌備於是大會進行上乃可入於光明之途、會塲空氣為之強化、茲分誌各方情形如次、</p>
<p>牛塚市長抗議</p>
<p>政友會河野一郎首先質問世運會憲章（規則）是否反乎日𤥒國情、牛塚東京市長對於組織委員會態度、表示不滿、以東京市擔任鉅欵籌備世運、甚不合理、雖可在政府補助金四百三十萬元具體方針之下進行、但組織委員會决定在东京開會、何以運動界已被排斥之某大學忽然活躍、是否組織委員會宮僚化乎、長此以往、三年後必無法進行、因此向文部當局抗議、文部次官（敎育次長）河原答稱委員會內議論紛紛確有其事、但今後希望入於圓滿協議之境域、組織委員會未必認定事務之機構、大可從長計議也、</p>
<p>建築有永久性</p>
<p>次庭球協會会長勝田永吉發言、謂德國以世運會視為國家事業美國則以世運會事宜為民間團體事業、但日本準倫世運應作如何觀念、林首相答稱、世運會並非國家政府之事、但國家須努力援助、又大會總預算一千五百萬元分配用途、建設費一千萬元、開會費五百萬元、勝田詢問、此次建設係永久的、或暫時的、其用意如何、文部次官河源答稱、並非暫時的建設、乃係永久的以資增進國民體育、內務省神社局長（內政部壇廟管理局長）兒玉謂、以明治神宮外苑為中心之大這動塲、內務省正在進行計劃中云、</p>
<p>注重專門技術</p>
<p>勝田繼謂現在運動團體參加世運者甚少、而占多數之政府方面委員少發言、形成體育協會與東京市之對立狀態、牛塚市長發言過鑫、致對於專門性質之競技部長鄉隆傳士、亦遭受反對、市長純係門外漢、對於專門性之競技部長人選、如此阻碍、今後深为憂慮、上届世運大會在柏林舉行、希特動總統對於組織委員長雷滑露博士不滿、但雷氏為體育界及專門家中最適當之人物、終於希特勒總統容　之、最後收穫良好之結果、故今後世運事宜專門性質之事、由專門家看負、使組織委員會義為強有力之機關云、</p>
<p>歡迎中國參加</p>
<p>日本體育界均認為中華民國係遠東主要國家、此次世運在遠東之日本東京舉行、遠東古國新興之中華民國、必須歡迎其參加、任何障碍、必須設法疏通之、否則體育界势必不安、中國自十一次世運在柏林失敗後、選手均有覺悟、政府當局亦急起提倡、上海建築大體育塲卽可證明、中國選手有不少後起之秀、但體育界訓練及管理方法不善、致遭失敗、今後如能對症下藥、中國體育之進步、亦足以驚動各國健兒也、</p>
<p>日本訓練體操</p>
<p>三年後如在目前之世運會在東京舉行、地主國日本現在開始訓練體操、二十日下午二時在慶應大學綱町體育塲、舉行第一次世運講習會期間至本月底、共計十日、以後預定逐漸舉行定期講習會、本年七月開夏季講習會、聞此次講習會參加之學校為文理科大學•早稻田大學•慶應大學、橫濱高等商業•慶普•慶商•府立六中•浦和中學講習內容為鐵棒•平行棒•鞍馬•吊環•跳躍、及徒手體操六種、講師係各校老前輩、慶應之野板、文理大學之松延兩前輩均參加指導云、</p>
<h3>西青女排球結束啟秀冠軍</h3>
<p>亞軍工女中</p>
<p>西青女子排球、現已全部結束、最後一塲啟秀對阿地雪白隊乙、於前日下午二時舉行、結果因雙方實力相差極遠、故除第二局因啟秀之隨意應付稍見接近外、其他兩局完全一面倒以終、三局比數為十五比一、十五比十、十五比一、總結四十五比十二、啟秀大勝、現啟秀以六戰六勝榮膺盟主、工部局女中則以五勝一負居亞軍、阿地雪白隊乙則六戰盡失、居於殿軍焉、茲録全部成績如下、</p>

<h3>東華對葡萄牙比賽展期舉行</h3>
<p>▲昨西捕法商大勝</p>
<p>今日甲組足球、原有東華對葡萄牙一塲、在市體育塲交鋒、惟據最後消息、謂因時值春節、各銀行均循例休假而東華隊員、大半服務於銀行界、故相率結隊赴外埠春遊、今日對葡比賽、已申請改期舉行云、</p>
<p>昨日計有甲組賽兩塲、均在虹口公園交鋒、結果臘克斯對西捕之役、西捕因得名將蕭脫歸來、重任後衛、實力因以大振、臘克斯則門將衣克霍夫、前鋒勃林蓋、格林勃、及中堅番孟等四健將、均因春遊離防、以預備球員庖代、致相差天壤、不堪西捕之一擊鏖戰以後、局勢盡在西捕掌握中、前半結束、西捕以四比○佔先、總結遂以九對二大勝、西捕盡雪第一循環中以十四比二失敗之恥辱、另塲法商對蘇殼爾之戰、蘇壳爾仍難振作、上牛時以二比三落後、後半则一敗塗地、又净失八球之多、總结為十一對二、法商大勝、</p>
<p>西捕勝臘克斯（甲）　九比二</p>
<p>法高勝蘇殼爾（甲）十一比二</p>

<p>主席開會詞　首由主席簡又文致開會詞、略謂、今天中國文藝協會上海本會舉行成立大會、我相信所有的文藝界對於這個組織、一定非常的贊同、因為上一次開發起人談話會的時候、大家都感覺到已往的文藝界、團結力量太薄弱•意見太分歧感情太不融洽、因此始終不能團結一致、現在大家都覺悟了、發起組織這一個團體、當然誰都贊同、而且一定的非常興奮、本會經過十五位籌備委員負責進行、開過五次會議、才把這章程緣起等、起草就緒、會所也租定在大陸商塲六樓六三一號、緣起中間共分五點、其中有二點很值得我們注意第一點、本會為完全聯絡感情、交換智識、而發起組織、第二點、集合全體力量、發揚民族精神、共赴國難、因為完全是聯絡感情、所以沒有政治作用、一定可以消除從前文藝團體不能健全組織的癓結、因為是集合團體力量、共赴國難、那麼一定可以消除一切派別門戶之見、而為整個民族國家的利益而奮鬥、</p>
<p>邵部長致詞　首由中央宣傳部部長邵力子致詞略謂、今天兄弟因為到會較遲、沒有聽到主席的報告、但是就桌上的印刷品來看、知道現在已有了一百二十餘位會員、上海文藝界同仁差不多全體參加、這是第一點可以慶幸的、第二點中國文藝協會的章程、雖然條文不多、可是組織很周密、這是第二點可慶幸的、尤其可慶幸的是本會緣起中的五點成立的理由、為文藝本身、為文藝作家本身、為國家民族的前途、都想得非常周密、一定可以預祝貴會前程遠大、因貴會的成立、而影響到中國文藝界、乃至整個國家民族的前途、也一定可以同樣的樂觀、同樣有很大的希望、這是第三點可慶幸的、文藝劉於社會民族國家關係的重要、今天在座的人一定比我還要明白、因為我祇能説是愛好文藝的人、並不是從事文藝的人、兄弟常常說、一個人從事一個職業、一定對於這件事感到特別的興趣、有深刻的認識、知道這件事的重要、從事文藝的人、也一定知道文藝的重要、用不着兄弟再說、所以兄弟今天到會、祇能表示兄弟的誠意、沒有可貢献的地方、並且所能貢献的地方、一切都包含在五條理由之內、為文藝前途謀發展、為文藝作家謀發展、為國家民族利益謀發展、在這五個理由之外、再要貢獻什麼意見、實在很不容易、但是旣然到會、不能不表示一點誠意、所以想到古人“文以載道”那句話、來作為禮物、貢獻給各𢓔、一文以載道這句話、近年以來、頗有些文藝作家反對它、尤其是為文藝而文藝的人特別反對、其實這句話的本身业不錯、祇是這個“道”字大多解釋錯誤了、“道”字的解釋、本來是很廣大的、不僅道學先生的道、宋儒的道、許多人反對“文以載道”的原因就是誤解了“道”字以為是道學的道、因此不是古𫆸賢的話不能講、不是有關道字的文章不能做、如果做了那種文章、彷彿失了文字的價值、失了本身的地位、其實古時所講的道有兩種意義、一種是無形的道、就是應該怎樣做人的道理叫做道另一種是有形的道、就是平時所走道路的道、如果拿走路的道來解釋“文以載道”、就是文藝可以指示人生以及國家民族所應該走的道路、人生應走的大道很多、拿什麼來指示呢、靠文字來指示“文”的意義比“文藝”廣大、“文藝”一定包含在內、“文”的中間、而且占“文”的重要地位、所以文藝　能感動人而且力量最深刻、最長久文藝的內容不是空的、是有物質的、所以能够感動人、物質是什麼呢、就是“道”、就是人生應走的各種大道、所以古人所謂的“文以戲道”、本身並沒有錯誤、錯誤是由於後人把廣　的解釋、誤作為狹義的道、因此為研究文藝的人所不滿我們明白了這個意義、今後的文藝作品就不能違背國家民族社會所應走的道路、譬如現在我們的民族受人壓迫欺侮、一方面民族本身的弱點太多、精神萎靡、意志渙散因此現在國家民族社會應走的大道、是要求獨立自由、堅強不屈團結一致、所以文藝作品文藝作家應走的路、一定也是如此、現在一般文藝作家、劉於中國國民黨以及中央宣傳部、有一種感想希望得到自由、這種話一定有許多文藝作家在內心中醞釀尤其是今天沒有到會或沒有加入本會的文藝作家或許更有這種意思、但是中國國民黨不是意大利的法西斯黨德國的國社黨、也不是蘇俄的共產黨、在中國國民黨之下的文藝作家、我相信一定能够得到相當的自由的、但是絕對的自由、沒有限制的自由、我可以不客氣的講、絕對不會有的、因為在總即遺教三民主義之中已經講得很明白、祇有國家的自由、民族的自由、才是真正的自由在國家民族的大前提之下、沒有個人的自由、並不是個人沒有自由、因為個人自由與國家民族的自由相比、個人－定要犧牲一點自由“文以載道”的道、不一定走一條路、有好幾條路都可以達到大道、並且也有種種的交通工具、不限定一定要用飛機、一定要乘火車、祇要同樣能達到這絛大道隨你走那一絛路、用一種工具、本來都可以有這個自由的、但是不照這康莊的大道去前進而向很危險的死路上去前進這個自由不客氣的說、不應獨得因為這是同國家民族利益相反的譬如說現在的國家、需要統一、如果有人要使一般人走上國家分裂的道路上去、這個自由我們自然不能允許、所以在不妨碍国家统一、不阻碍民族復興的前提之下、都可以自由的走他的路、否則絕對沒有自由、现在中華民國應定的大道是什麼呢、在現在的時　、左面的路走不通、右面的路也走不通走進去就有危險、祇有中間的一條路可以走、中間的是什麼大道、就是三民主義的大道、所以我們相信文藝作家也一定要在三民主義之下的路上進行、成為三民主義的文藝、在三民主養的文藝之下、才有很自由的道路、可以向前進行、這是兄弟今天所買獻於各位的一點禮物、最後敬祝各位前程無量、中國文藝協曾前程無量、（未完）</p>

<h3>絲織工人待遇條件明晨調解</h3>
<p>南市勝旦等廠已復工　美亞第十錦新未解决</p>

<p>南市各廠業已復工</p>
<p>前晚七時、突有某區絲織業公會、主張全市實行總罷工、並率領已罷工各廠工人、赴南市斜土路瞿眞人路一帶、聯合該處罷工之錦新等廠工人、阻止勝旦華成久華廠工人上工、於是上述各廠相率罷工、幸經當局派警彈壓、將阻止上工之工人驅散、並向罷工各廠工人勸告、靜候明日祉會局之調解、於是各廠工人始允復工、昨晨該處各廠、雖照常開工、均由警察總局派武裝警士保護、</p>
<p>美亞錦新仍未復工</p>
<p>㊀閘北八字橋美亞第十廠工人重行罷工、經社會局派員勸告無效後、罷工工人堅持要求釋放被補之一工人、因該工人已由警察總局解地方法院核辦、所以各工人仍在繼續罷工之中、㊁滬東平凉路隆仁里錦新绸廠工人於十六日起罷工後、经社會局令飭工人尅日復工、工人已遵令進廠復工、因廠方將工人代表樓宗芳何堯等十名宣布開除、所以工人不願復工、仍在罷工中、</p>

<h3>現代政治與中國（續）</h3>
<p>— 君山</p>
<p>第三，到今天這時候大家當然可以看出晚近由失利貧弱中復興的國家，其政治幾無一而非舉國在一個政治信仰一個政治領導與一個政治目標的確立中得到成功，這卽是說明晚近復興的國家，無一而非舉國奉行一個主義，服從一個領袖遵行一個國策，達成其復興的大業。那末，我們中國有認識的人士，今日又何必徘徊瞻顧而不立卽急起直追，走上這條成功的大路，而要來花樣百出，喊甚麼各黨各派合作的口號呢？總之，大家如果奉行一個主義，服從一個領袖，遵行一個國策，决沒有不能合作的道理，反是大家如果不能奉行一個主義，服從一個領袖，遵行一個國策，又何從得到合作的途徑咧？卽使表面可以一時勉強合作，又有甚麼好結果咧？中國國民黨在其五十餘年奮鬥歷史的過程中，對國中任何革命派別的人士，無不盡量容納，大家現經覺察國家民族的需要何不迫切了富在一個信仰，一個領導，一個目標下來從事於國家民族，復興的奮鬥咧？若不此之圖，而只妄想假借合作的美名，以冀售其欺人自欺的好計，則不但有五十餘年奮斗經提的中國國民黨必不致受此種路人皆知之欺瞞，卽革命之中國民眾亦必不願我革命之中國民黨，接受此種之欺瞞，當可斷言。我們認清現代政治的潮流，我們更確信孫總理以黨治國，卽是以主義治國之大道理，我們必要以黨治做搖籃，把我們中國政治的基礎培養起來•必須這樣，我們的國家與民族才能復興與挽救。同志們這裏有我們國家民族的事業，這裏也有我們自己的事業，是時候了，我們大家－起來努力！大家一起來當鬥！（完）</p>

<h3>鋼條訟案</h3>
<p>林寶庭控金城銀行　內容複難候傳人證</p>

<p>金城銀行</p>
<p>之倉庫中、去年十二月十五日、實庭忽致函金城銀行、謂鋼條提單業已遺失、如再發現應請作廢、該銀行因已先據林錦庭持單聲明存鋼、屬渠所有、故卽函復實庭、並告以該貨於堆存時、約定憑單提取、旣欲掛失、須照定章覓具店鋪書面之</p>
<p>負責保證</p>
<p>否則為顧全倉庫起見、准持單人有提貨之權、嗣後實庭因所具店鋪保證信、多不適合手續往還遷延、雖逾期限、猶未辦安、該項存鋼、逐不為其所有、實庭乃延宣震東律師向第一特區地方法院對金城銀行及該行長吳蘊齋提起訴訟、要求返還</p>
<p>寄存貨物</p>
<p>昨日下午、由徐福基推事傳審、原告由宣律師代表出庭、陳述起訴意旨、並提出與金城往來交涉信函、被告則由鄂森律師代表到案抗辯、謂因原告久不辦妥保證、故被告祇能由林錦庭提去、今錦庭已到庭、當可證明一切、遂據林錦庭供稱實庭係我弟、因其</p>
<p>用空泰利</p>
<p>七千元、泰利以係我荐保、責成我賠償、迄今尚未賠清、提單乃實庭於上年親手給我備抵代為賠欵之損失、現尚存在我處云云、原告律師卽否認單係原告交給、庭上乃訊以該單究竟如何遺失、而原告律師則稱關於此層</p>
<p>實屬難說</p>
<p>但無論如何、非原告交給、於是鄂律師遂請求補傳泰利洋行、俾可證明林實庭挪用該行房租鉅欵、現方由林錦庭分期賠償事件、徐推事並以本案原告、更有親自到庭受鞠之必要、遂諭改期四月七日下午、傳集原告曁人證再行續訊</p>

<h3>論物價飛漲（一）</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>從上海躉售物價指數，表示着已回復經濟衰落初期（民国二十年九月）的物價。</p>
<p>從報紙上，屬目可見的，各叢商品漲價的廣告；另一方面，儘多要求改良待遇而引起的勞資糾紛新聞。</p>
<p>從現實方面去看，三個銅板一塊大餅，不能如早先的可以解决我的饑餓•一元鈔票的花費，好似不如以前的那樣經用。</p>
<p>下面這張表，僅就本年二三兩月各業漲價見之於廣告者一加整理，已有了五十三起。其實各種商品俱在騰貴中，有大宗市場的，他的價格的升騰，不見之於廣告；這裏所有者，不過百業之中，小乎其小的一部分，然而他的聲勢已是可觀了•</p>
<p>一看他的漲價原因，五十三起之中，除了英商自來水公司爲了－九三六年的匯價改低，支出增加，要將合同購水的折扣自七五折提高至八折外，其餘的那一起不是爲原料“飛漲”“續漲”“猛漲”的緣故呢！此外尚有在“捐稅繁重”“增加統稅的原因下而提高了價格，但是絕少數•</p>
<p>原料飛漲到何種程度？但就按加工程度分類的上海躉售物價指數而觀，與未行法幣以前（二十四年十月）一為比較，確乎增加不少了。二十四年十月原料品合計的指數為八•○，如今是（二十六年二月）已到一一四•九，高起了二六九。製造品指數，也從九七•五，引到了一二七•三，幾乎加起了三○，本來製造品的加債，常要超過原料增加的程度，（這是指多數而言）因為物價提高，他的開支也要提高了。如五十三起加價表中，有幾種已是第二次加價了•有幾種將定價改為買售；有幾種雖不說明漲價，但將提高價格歸納於重訂價目之中；亦有如醬園業將支票付欵，改為國幣付現；此外多則加起了五成，少則一成，大多數則為二成二成。且看下表：</p>
<p>再看這許多原料飛漲中之原料，究竟是洋貨居多，土貨居多？不消說得，五十三起之中，倒有三分之以上是與洋貨有關的。</p>
<p>幣值的變遷，影響到物價，物價的變遷，自然影響到生活。莫談上海市的生活費指數，今年以來，顯然地比去年年度增中百分之三以上。但看近數月來接二連三的工潮，紡織業，染織業，絲織業，針織業，繅絲業，電車業，汽車業，造船業，航運業，甚而至於木業，洋燭業，古玩業，也為了改良待遇，而發生了糾紛。其中如絲織業，集合了九十八廠工人，組織了要求改良待遇委員會，提出了聯合要求。此外絡繹散見於報章或未經報紙發表的勞資糾紛，尚不知有多少。這是現實問題，卽如工人之願，增加了工資，假使物價的漲風迄無止境，那未增加工資所得，能不能解决他的生活困难，還是疑問？何况工資與物價又是互是因果，工資加了，成本重了，物價難免不再度提高；如是循環下去，或許是必無之事：但如物價上昇，不籌適常合理的處置，終不免有此一日</p>
<p>不要說原料品製造品的價格飛漲，就是近來公價行市的活躍，也為發行統公債以來所未有。本來公債　鈔票，可說是躉批的鈔票，一是零星的鈔票，而最近的飛漲，是否為了百物俱貴的緣故，不可無此點級，那是不得而知了。卽如法幣施行以來，本極穩固，然而市場仍不無多所傳說，此雖為投機者之慣披，原不足信；但是空穴來風，徒亂人意，遂使物價失其安定，當非推行法幣之本意呀！</p>
<p>因之，對於物價前途，認為</p>
<p>㊀物價由刺激而上昇，是否與民生實業，實有裨益，這是最應值得研究的一件事。</p>
<p>㊁工潮的兇惡，（如新裕二廠職工之開槍互毆成傷，及美亞十廠工人毆傷警長）對於物價變遷，愈覺有審慎處置之必要，免因生活問題，引起重重工潮。</p>
<p>㊂施行法幣，已一年有半，財政上固得收支平衡，則一切無稽謂言，自可不攻而破。</p>
<p>㊃中央儲備銀行，能得早日成立，法幣發行完全集中，並鞏固其信用基礎，俾物價得以更形安定。</p>
<p>㊄增加統稅，推行所得稅，俱有提高物價之可能，在此種工商業處境之下，增稅的方式分量，也是必須鄭重的。</p>
<p>㊅走私更形猖獗，若使物價愈貴，擭利愈厚，走私之風恐將愈盛。</p>
<h3>論物價飛漲（二）</h3>
<p>— 周伯棣</p>
<p>㊀物價之漲幾為世界之冠在健全通貨的時代，通貨收縮，物價隨之低跌；物價低跌的結果，企業之利潤步縮，工人的失業𤍖增，而國家的財政，亦復赤字橫行•於是健全通貨為整個的不景氣所摧毀，代之而起的，乃為通貨膨賬政策。（註二）在通貨膨賬政策之下，第一步是公債增發了，第二步是信用膨脹了；第三步也許是真正的通貨膨脹了。不論通貨膨脹政策，是否貫澈到第三個步驟，但物價被這政策所刺激，漸趨高漲，乃為必然的事實；固然愈到第二第三個步驟，物價飛漲的速率將愈快。</p>
<p>近年通貨膨脹政策的創始，起於一九三一年九月英國的停止金未位；以後日美等國起而效尤，我國亦復停止銀本位，德意等國則行嚴格的匯兌管理；直至最後法蘭西瑞士等復放棄金本位，於是世界各國，沒有一國不以壓低匯價為目標，而染上了通貨膨脹的色彩了。</p>
<p>各國採取了通貨膨脹政策，對外壓低了匯價，對內也就相應的抬高了物價了。我們試觀這數年來主要國物價如下：（以一九二九年為</p>
<p>為二十四年之總指數</p>
<p>由上表可知一月份的上海物價，比前年十月漲了百分之二七•五；去年十二月份的廣州物價，比前年的總指數漲了百分之二六•七一；去年十二月份的漢口物價比前年的總指數漲了百分之一六•二；去年十二月份的南京物價，比前年的總指數漲了百分之二•二；今年一月份的華北物價，比前年的總指數漲了百分之三○•八二；把這些地方飛漲的百分數平均起來，我們可以說最近各地的物價，約莫漲了百分之二二•五。這比了日本的物價的漲峯，有過之無不及（註二），事實上幾寫世界各國之冠了！</p>
<p>㊁物價與匯價的磨擦</p>
<p>今日各國通貨膨賬政策的目標，一方面固在乎拍高物價以刺激產業，恢復景氣：地方面更在乎抑低匯價，以促進輸出抑制輸入，間接的亦所以助長產業恢復景氣，然而要是匯價趨跌而物價則以同一比例趨高，則高低相差，匯兌傾銷的功轉將化歸鳥有；而貿易必將趨於逆關•所以為謀貿易的順調，匯價的低降率必須大於物價的高漲率才好；固然這兩個比率相差太遠，馴致形成饑餓輸出（Ｈudger　export）的局面，也是不好的。</p>
<p>上列這些國家，除出法國外，自一九三一年以來的物價都有趨高的傾向，只有德國自一九三四年才開蛤趨漲，至於法國呢，也從一九三六年九月停止金本位以後，物價才見趨漲。到了今甘，物價趨漲已為各國一致的步調；尤其是日本因龐大預算的結果，物價的漲峯更甚，簡直形成為財政當局的難題了。</p>
<p>至於我們中國，自從民國廿四年十一月四日實行法幣政策以來，國內的物價，也就隨着世界的高物价趋势而上涨了。茲試列一表以明之如下：（以民國十五年為一○○）</p>
<p>但是我國的外匯，自從實行新貨幣政策以來，幾乎釘住在一先令二便士半的匯率。這一先令一便士半比了民國二十四年十月的匯率一先令四便士又四分之三（註三），固然减低着白分之十三•四（rno086.6=13.4），但　匯價的減低率，顯然比物價的抬高率要小得多。這裏我們不能說匯價的不够低，我們只能說物價，拾得太高了。因為中國是一個原料國，匯價過低，意卽使原料輸出過多，究非國民經濟之福，同時中國是一個僓務國，在沒有實行賴債的限度內，匯價過低也决不是公經濟之利；所以匯價釘住於一先令二便士半，殊覺無可厚非。</p>
<p>但反之，物價過高，顯然打銷了匯兌壓低的機能，使輸出為之困難，输入為之容易，實使貿易顯然為之惡化的。我國去年對外貿易在表面上看來，輸入固見减少，但如加上走私的输入，則输入也許反見增加，又输出表面上雖見增加，但這恐由於非常時期外國對於原料品的需要激增之故吧！</p>
<p>㊂物價與工資相乖離</p>
<p>物價的飛漲，既無助於貿易的促進，但他方面，却有害於一般人的生活。因為物價指數漲了：生活費指數也必然的隨之增漲了。我們試看上海天津北平三地的生活費指數吧：（以民國十五年為一○○）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>再談“走私”</h3>
<p>— 史楫</p>
<p>對於無恥的日韓浪人的走私，我以為除了積極把我們的緝私人員武裝起來，實行武裝緝私之外，於我們這一方面，實在並沒有再好的第二條路可走。自然，我們是愛好和平，並且是極希望把邦交敦睦起來的，但在“友邦”還沒有自動的把他們的浪人的非法糾織取締之前，我們為了維護主權的完整，却不能不武裝起来保護我們的利益。這不是妨害邦交，而在中國的國土，“友邦”的僑民，也理應受我們的法律制裁的。——雖然在中國，因為受了種種不平等條約的束縛，連這極起碼的友邦僑民應受居留地的法律的制裁都沒有做到。</p>
<p>然而在現在從“上海丸”兇毆關員成傷事件之後，走私旣未見歛跡，日鮮浪人的態度，並且益見强橫，甚至連關員在執行職務的時候，隨時均處威脅空氣之下：而於我們呢，緝私人員發了一個“希望政府把我們武裝起來”“盼望全國各界人士對我們的愿望及要求加以熱烈的援助”的宣言，却要“查究主動人物”了，而緝私人員在“俱樂部”開會商議應付辦法的時候，也有了監視，理由是“海關同人俱樂部，係海關同人公餘娛樂塲所，”所以“不得集會討論非娛樂事什，”而“關於緝私問題，須服從上級人員指揮，不得在未得上級人員指輝之前，擅自執行，釀成種種糾紛。”</p>
<p>“服從上級人員指揮，”這原是必要的，從這次兒玉先生回國所乘的上海丸事件來作證，海關當局所定的所謂“妥善緝捕辦法，”也似乎的確收到了實效，“經悉行搬置海關小輪上，送往海關沒收。”但可注意的，則是：“當海關前往抄查之時，走私浪人，初擬行兇搶奪，嗣以兒玉等卽於是晨登輪歸國，恐太傷體面，　　　　　　　　　　　　。如果不為“兒玉等卽於是，登輪回國”試問，這些查獲的銅元，能不被搶奪嗎？———“此種走私事伴，如不能謀根本消滅之辦法，則將來糾紛，正方與未艾。”這樣的結論，無疑的是非常的正確可靠的。</p>
<p>也有人把這次“例外”的事件認為是“可見浪人亦尚有羞惡之心，”因之作為一種慰藉。”這種“慰藉，”以我淺近的眼光來看，是未免要落空的。走私在現在旣是有組織的，而那天如果沒有日領署警察制止，恐怕還不免要一搶，我們看了過去好多次的事實，而兒玉先生等又祇有這一次，除了中日關係有了整個的很好的解決，試問這樣的“慰藉”是可靠的嗎？我想，在不久之後，這是會有事實來替我們證明的。</p>
<p>至於海關當局的“妥善辦法，”我們自然希望他繼續奏效，但在關員們被毆之後，不要再作“公文的旅行，讓關員們已躺在醫院裏了，銅元被刧去已鎔成彈殼了，還是沒有確當的辦法。更不要抱了息事寗人的態度，視若無覩的讓緝私人員處在威脅的空氣下，而自己却高高在上的不“指揮”。</p>
<h3>燭臺</h3>
<p>— 卓人</p>
<p>一個古銅的燭臺放在我的書桌上，蠟炬的四周留着無數鼠類嚙咬的殘跡，從前殷紅的顏面已變成灰諳了：然而它再能傲然屹立在我的書桌上，給我光明，這是千載難漨的綠了。</p>
<p>我向吊在室中的電燈望着，它是那样安靜，彷彿沒有知道它的主人因為不能付出一筆電費而無求於它了。那燭臺也慶幸它的一朝得寵，燭蕊上結着弧形的燈化，火燄閃耀着，照見我的書廚，我的臥床，照見牆壁上父親的遺影…對於他或許會感得特別親切吧，因為那是父親的遺物。</p>
<p>父視畢生的精神幾乎完全消耗在燭臺的細小底燈光下：年經的時候，他在燭臺邊讀書，常常到窗外透進肚白的微曦的時候；但是他的努力沒有達到他及祖父祖母的期望，進了秀才，就永遠無法再爬上一級了，雖然他在燭臺邊的時間更廷長，更努力。於是他放棄了書本子，憤而習商。但是那古銅的燭臺，並不因他改行而疏遠，相反地，他們更形密切了。在我們合家睡靜之後，父親把自己關在書房裏，像從前攻書的時候一樣，他在計算他的營業的贏虧，算盤珠答答地響着。</p>
<p>他在燭台邊此長了白髮，他的精力像蠟炬一樣，到了燈盡油乾的時候，他和畢生的伴侶沒有說一句他所要說的話而溘然長逝。</p>
<p>不過每年有一次，那燭臺照見父親的笑容。吃冬至夜飯那天，父親在店裏回來總在半夜了，但那天是合家最高興的一天，大家癟着肚子等候着，燭臺上換上了中秋夜裏遺留下來的天燭，堂前也燃了一盞宮紗燈，那是我家難得有的光明之夜。母親胸前束着罩裙，在廚房裏煮菜，一邊又忙着祠堂的火燭，她常常抽空往來着，看那些焚化的冥袋，已经完全熄減了沒有。而父親特別喜歡的幾色菜，她又煮得那樣謹愼，直到嚮起了搥門，聽見父親呌聲的時候，大家擁到大門外，替父親拿燈龍的拿燈籠，搶雨傘的搶雨傘，而父親背上的背搭，却總是母親去接手的。那背搭是那樣沉重，父親和母親的笑容在微弱的燈光下相映着，孩子們就歡呼着擁到後堂去。</p>
<p>父親到祠屋裏叩過頭，默默地祈壽着，那樣嚴肅，那樣虔敬，他在向祖父祖母訴說他沒有做得一官半職吧？到他死去的時候，他始終沒有說出他所冀希着的是什麽，因為他督促我們讀書依是严紧異常。“书是不能不讀的”！他祇有這樣一句话。回到堂屋裏，菜餚已放滿了桌子，一张太師椅放在正中，父親喜歡的菜也放在面前，於是他打着哈哈—那難有笑聲半響在堂屋裏激盪着。他一個個為我們指定了坐位，他然後坐到太師椅中，搶過母親手裏的酒壺，先為母親注了半盅，彷彿欵待一個遠道來的賓客似的說：</p>
<p>“辛苦了，喝一盅暖暖肚。”</p>
<p>母親笑着，“外面天冷，你多喝一盅吧”。</p>
<p>“還沒有下雪，冷的日子在後面”。父親總是笑着，把他面前的菜分點給我們，就高興地喝酒了。</p>
<p>那燭臺就伴在父親的左側，火光照着父親微醉了的笑容，漸慚地流满了燭油熄去。</p>
<p>搬到上海来後，父親依舊喜歡用燭裏，他說電燈光下做事彷彿不能安心似的。吃冬至夜飯時，他也忘不了在桌旁放着那古铜的燭臺，同時揰上中秋夜裏遺留下來的天燭。</p>
<p>去年的冬至夜飯桌上，太師椅空了起來，而祭祀的時候多了父親的一份杯盅。母親那天沒有吃飯，也沒有人想到那古銅的燭臺。</p>
<p>現在它的燭蕊上綻着燈花，那正是中秋節遺留下來的天燭，於是我輕輕地把它移到父親像片面前，讓它閃耀的火燄去伴倍着父觀的寂寞吧，祇有它，能够知道父親所要說的話的。</p>

<p>將要出獄的前幾天，我就拿定主意，一恢復自由馬上再回到“海參威”去誰料牢外的世界完全與我想像中的不同，牠變了，變得使我吃驚不但去“海參威”的美夢破滅，連“哈爾濱”也不易去啦於是我祇得帶著警察應發給我的二十元“老頭帖子”，（朝鮮銀行紙幣）那是我在獄中五年來做苦工所應得的報酬離開“大連”，離開了殖民地的奴隸的囚牢東新回到七年前我曾居留過的齊東山野。</p>
<p>又踏上了舊日走熟了的羊腸小道，疲乏絆住了兩腿，在溫柔和暖的陽光下，我坐在右硼上打盹，從遠處的麥田，松林，溪流，和近處的山谷，不斷透出春的氣息來。我沉醉了，一直睡著，當黃昏在我身上篩了黃金似的光輝時，我才醒來。火急的趕著路程，到掌燈時，我已置身於獵手陳老田之家了。</p>
<p>我突然的歸來，使老獵手又驚又喜等我明白的告訴了他，我七年來的遭遇之後，他喜歡得滴了眼淚。他那般的體貼我，彷彿待他自己的親生兒女似的這麼以來，我便留在他身邊，跟着他上山打獵，下田耕種。夜裏在草屋裏坐在油燈下聽他滔滔不絕的講着他的往事和“黃龍峴”的歷史。</p>
<p>“黃龍峴”地方的農民和獵戶都忠厚質樸，他們和平的生活着，没有仇恨，沒有嫉忌，也沒有爭奪和劫掠對於我，他們並不以外鄉人看待，反之却和蔼的同我親近，因之我的生活是和他們溶洽在一起了。</p>
<p>春天是快活的季候，農夫和獵手都開始了自己的工作。祗有那些多情的姑娘和熱情的青年，才煩惱的咒詛春天。春天燃着了他們的情火，無可撲滅的燃燒着！姑娘們無論在河邊上洗衣，或是在菜圃中裁菲菜，總有年青的小伙子追逐。有時在草原上，菜樹園中，不斷的看到有年青的男女親密的談笑。風俗給了他們以自由，誰也不能干涉或妨害他們春天撒下了愛的種子，很快的在“黃龍峴”地方長出芽葉。自由的山野啊人們無據無束的生活着，他們愛好和平，但不受別人的欺侮！</p>
<p>山上的積雪早已隨着灼灼的陽光融化了。松林拂动着春風，時時發出呼哨。伐木的人，困倦的，不自在的搶着斧頭，很長的時間才斫倒一顆樹。午飯後照例我是雙身的上山，在大石硼上崛覺，再不然就同伐木人談天。太陽一往西轉，我就背起搶去打兔子和野雉。這期間頂好打的是野雉，牠們總是一雙一對的，很不機警，所以打起來十槍九中，而且母的佔多數。</p>
<p>滿山滿野都充溢着愉快的氣象。農夫在麥田里唱着山歌，村姑也唱呢？不遇不是山歌，而是懷春的情歌。老獵手陳老田的女兒也成天的唱歌，推磨的時候唱，做飯的時候也唱，她的情人一來，她主让她的喉咙休息了，情人走了又是唱，也许歌唱是可以消磨煩惱的吧？</p>
<p>一天我向老獵手的女兒以及她的情人背了獵槍沿著環繞村莊的河流走去。清澈澈的流水泛着閃光的微波，成羣的鴨子浮游着。孩子們挽了褲腿，在水里捉魚摸蝦，渾身濺着水渍和綠苔。我們穿過石板橋，一直向東邊的柳樹行走去．赤條的柳技已吐出嫩綠的萌芽了麻雀在草地上飛躍着，找食剛出土的毛毛虫。樹林外是一片廣闊平坦的田野，綠油的麥田和晴凈的蔚藍天空互相映照。應成羣的在麥田里吃麥苗。我們裝好了槍打雁了。可是雁是一構草不遇的機警鳥類，因之也很難打。我們三個好容易才找到二條“草??”作掩護，三人一齊開槍，隋着枪聲，应羣飛起了，四散的飛起。我們跑過去，並沒有落空，打死了五雙。枝子（老獵手的女兒）笑了，她提着死了的雁，注視着她的情人笑了。我們又转入山谷，在溪流邊的草坪上休息了一會兒，又跑到松林中去打兔子。布穀鳥不住的呌，誰也不惹牠，此地的風谷，獵手不能打布榖鳥，牠是催農夫耕種的天鳥，像負有使命的天使似的，人們不能傷害牠枝子忽然發現了一雙山貓，一槍就打中了她喜歡的跳起來，她說兩年沒有打着山貓了，山貓皮是很贵重的。我們正走着，迎面走來兩個年輕的獵手。他們告訴我們，在山腰後的深石洞中有一個花臉狠，他們兩人已跟了牠三天，打了幾槍都不成，意思是呌我們一同去打。轉過山坡，爬過兩個大石嶺才到了那石洞附近，用了種方法不能使那花臉狼出來，最後我們都躺在地上，靜寂無聲，老半天牠才出來了，我五個人一齊開槍，在槍聲亂響中，那花臉狠飲彈斃命了。</p>
<p>晚上歸來的時候，老獵手很滿意，我們的收穫成續很大，這一夜村中熱鬧非凡，鑼鼓喧天，燒香燒紙，明天就是祭春神的日子了。</p>
<h3>賽金花（十）</h3>
<p>— 陳禾作</p>
<p>紳拳的集團，名為義和團。他們的精神，確是樹立了不少光榮的事蹟。像抵制洋貨，無論什麼人家；假使有洋貨，就得趕快毀棄。不然就得受木頭塊琉璃屑的賞光了。見懂洋文會說洋話的人，就被當為“直眼”，“二毛子”：就是漢奸的意思。抓到壇上由大師兄焚二道符，問問你是不是好人，符焚後如果升起，你就是好人：不然，立刻就得刴死。當然也有𡨚死的；可是在當時，確有許多懂洋文會說洋話的人，做了出賣民族的漢奸。</p>

He rested at the suburban sports association and returned to the city at 2:00 PM in the afternoon. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Changsha] Chairman Lin is scheduled to go to Mount Heng from Guilin on the 7th for sightseeing. The provincial government has sent personnel to Mount Heng to arrange the headquarters. Changsha is preparing a grand welcome rally to respectfully request instructions from Chairman Lin. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Huang Xuchu of Guilin telegraphed on the 28th that he will personally go to Hengyang to await Chairman Lin. Fellow Fujianese from Guilin have also sent representatives to Hengyang to welcome him. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] The Guangdong circles' welcome rally for Chairman Lin was held at the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall at 3:00 PM on the 28th. More than ten thousand people, including Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, Luo Zhuoying, Yu Junxian, Zeng Yangfu, and representatives from various circles, attended with great enthusiasm. Chairman Lin arrived at 3:00 PM, accompanied by Xiang Hanping. All provincial civil and military officials stood in front of the hall's square to welcome and support the chairman's entry into the memorial hall. The entire audience bowed three times to the chairman in the highest form of respect. After Yu Hanmou delivered a welcoming speech, Chairman Lin was invited to speak. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM. The Chairman's instructions are as follows: Fellow compatriots, I am very happy to be able to gather here with all of you today. I have been away from Guangzhou for many years. This time, in order to commemorate the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, I have specially come to Guangzhou from Nanjing via the Yuehan Railway to pay my respects. As you all know, the Guangzhou Uprising on March 29th was launched by our party's martyrs in Guangzhou under the orders of the Premier to continue the revolution. Unfortunately, it failed, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs for the nation and the people. Although the uprising failed, it further shocked the national revolutionary sentiment, leading to the success of the Xinhai Revolution soon after. Therefore, it can be said that the uprising of March 29th was the impetus for the success of the Xinhai Revolution. If there had been no uprising of March 29th, there would have been no successful Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution. Therefore, when we remember the revolutionary achievements of the martyrs, we must not forget the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang for the country and the people. In order to honor the martyrs and commemorate their contributions to the country, we should enthusiastically hold memorial days for the martyrs to show our faith in worshipping the martyrs. Therefore, this year's commemoration of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang is being held on a larger scale for this reason. At the same time, this is also the reason for my visit to the South. We must know that Guangdong is the cradle of the revolution. Our compatriots in Guangdong, the cradle of the revolution, should make special efforts to promote and carry forward the revolutionary spirit and the revolutionary cause left to us by the martyrs and strive to complete it. I think the responsibility borne by the compatriots in the cradle of the revolution is relatively heavy. Many people say, "In the East, there is Confucius, and Confucius is our cultural mentor. Therefore, the responsibility borne by the people of Shandong for culture is more important than others." And Guangdong is the cradle of the revolution, Guangdong is the base for the Premier's advocacy of revolution, and the Premier is also the founding father of the Republic of China. Our compatriots in Guangdong, the birthplace of the founding father of the Republic of China, should take on special responsibility compared with other provinces to realize the unfinished revolutionary cause left to us by the Premier. The Premier told us, "The Three Principles of the People are the principles of national salvation. Our country today has reached such a critical moment. May I ask, should we not save the country? If we believe that we should save the country, then we must realize the Three Principles of the People." The Premier also told us to restore our nation's inherent morality and catch up with world culture." These two sentences are very simple in words, but their meaning is very great. In the midst of the serious national crisis, we should follow the Premier's teachings, strive to restore our nation's inherent morality, and accept various new sciences from the world, catch up with them, be of one heart and one mind, be sincerely united, and work hard for the future of China. There is hope. We must know that foreigners dare to bully us and invade us because we lack the power of unity. Everyone is like a heap of loose sand, so it has caused foreigners to bully us. If we want to save the country in the future, the first thing we must do is to unite, eliminate the old habits of disorganization, work together with one heart, be consistent from top to bottom, and the country's future can be turned from danger to safety. In particular, everyone should unanimously take out our blood and sweat money and strength to enrich our national defense, promote our production, and develop our construction, step by step, work hard, in order to achieve a rich and powerful situation. Today, I am very grateful for your warm welcome. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yu Xuezhong and Yang Hucheng Pass Through Nanjing from Shaanxi and Go to Shanghai to Hangzhou</h3>
<p>This trip is to meet with Chiang Kai-shek to report on the aftermath of the Xi'an Incident and the reorganization and redeployment of troops. Yang and Yu both made statements in Nanjing.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Yu Xuezhong and Yang Hucheng, who were summoned by Chairman Chiang a few days ago, arrived from Xi'an on the morning of the 28th on the Euro-Asia No. 15 giant plane. Yu and others passed through Nanjing at 4:30 PM and landed at the Ming Palace Airport. Few people knew about it beforehand. Only Wang Shuchang, Vice President of the Military Council, Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Huang Yongxi, Director of the Gansu Provincial Government Office in Nanjing, went to the airport to welcome them. After the plane stopped, Yu Xuezhong got off the plane first, wearing a dark gray suit and looking energetic. He shook hands with the welcoming staff one by one and went to the Euro-Asia reception room to talk with Wang Shuchang for about half an hour. Yang Hucheng also came on the same plane, but no one knew it at first. Only Li Zhigang, a member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, was seen coming on the same plane. He hurriedly went to the station to make a phone call. Soon, a man in a dark blue Zhongshan suit, with a tall and slender figure and wearing yellow leather shoes, was seen strolling with his hands behind his back next to the airport. An entourage was carrying a briefcase and staying close to him. It was Yang. When Yang came to Nanjing three years ago, his face was thinner, but now he is fatter than before. Those who saw him almost did not recognize him. A reporter asked Yang about the purpose of this trip. Yang smiled and said, "I will now take the same plane to Hangzhou. When I return to Nanjing, I will talk to you in detail. This time, I was summoned by Chairman Chiang to go to Hangzhou to meet with him and report on the aftermath of the Shaanxi Province and ask for instructions on everything. The aftermath of Shaanxi Province has been completed, and there is no problem in the Northwest now. The outside world still talks about the Northwest problem. This should be corrected. Now everyone agrees that it is necessary to support the leader and unify the national strength. Shaanxi Province has had a few bad years and has had poor harvests. The finances are also difficult, so the only problem at present is the financial problem, which still needs to be sorted out a little. After reporting to Chairman Chiang in Hangzhou, I will go to Nanjing to meet with President Yu and others. As for whether to visit Zhang Hanqing in Xikou, it will be decided after meeting with Chairman Chiang. As for the remaining bandits on the border of Shaanxi, they can also be resolved in the short term." Afterwards, Li Zhigang stepped forward and reported that he had called Minister He to report that he had passed through Nanjing. Yang handed over a written statement after finishing the conversation. This trip to the south is solely to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the reorganization of the troops and the defense situation in accordance with the order. The troops have now been reorganized into two divisions. The former 17th Route Army Headquarters has been cancelled in accordance with the order, and the headquarters is also being reduced in size. In the Northwest, after Director Gu conveyed the Central Government's intentions and Chairman Chiang's great spirit of public loyalty and patriotism, the military and civilians were greatly inspired and further strengthened their support. Now that the country is unified, the only way to consolidate the Central Government and obey the leader is to achieve national salvation by resisting the enemy. Today, there is no so-called Northwest problem. The will and wishes of the military and civilians in the Northwest have been completely unified. They only know how to support the leader and defend against aggression. They will do their best to be loyal to anyone who is beneficial to the country. Before boarding the plane, Director Yu Xuezhong said that the various armies of Zhang and part of the troops under his command have reached the designated defense area in Anhui and Henan. The rest are still on the way. As of now, about half of the relocation has been completed. The troops under his command can be completely transferred to the east by the 10th of next month. The two cavalry divisions are still in their original defenses. Once the various troops are transferred to the east, the cavalry will also be transferred to the east immediately. The relocation should be completed completely within the next month. I came here this time after being summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the troop transfer and ask for instructions. After returning to Shaanxi, I will meet with Zhang Hanqing. After the troops have completely arrived at the new defense area, I will go to Bengbu and come to Nanjing again to meet with the central authorities. The local area of ​​Gansu is stable, but in the past, it was affected by drought. Although the agricultural harvest was good last year, there were more stationed troops, and the food was insufficient. As a result, the people of Gansu felt a great lack of food. It is planned to ask the central government and all parties to handle accounts and relief. At about 6:00 PM, after the plane stopped refueling, Yu and Yang shook hands with the welcoming staff and boarded the plane and flew to Shanghai one after another. The people on the same plane included Yu's secretary Sun Xiangqian, adjutant Han Fayao, Shaanxi Provincial Government member Li Zhigang, Yang's adjutant director Jia Wenyu, secretary Zhou Fanbai, and more than a dozen attendants. Li Jingcong, general manager of Euro-Asia Company, was also on the plane. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Yang Hucheng, Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi Province, and Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, flew to Nanjing from Xi'an on the 28th afternoon at 4:30 PM on the Euro-Asia giant plane. Wang Shuchang, Vice President of the Military Council, Zheng Daoru, Secretary of the Executive Yuan, Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, Huang Dawei, Counselor of the Military Council, and Huang Yongxi, Director of the Gansu Provincial Government Office in Nanjing, all went to the airport to welcome them. After Yang and Yu got off the plane, Yang walked around the airport, while Yu went to the airport lounge with the welcoming staff to reminisce. Then at 5:00 PM, they took the original plane to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou to meet with Chairman Chiang for instructions. The staff who came with Yang and Yu included Li Zhigang, member of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, and secretaries Zhou Fanbai, Jia Wenyu, and adjutants. The staff also flew to Shanghai on the same plane. According to Director Yang, who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter at the airport, the purpose of this trip to the south was to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the reorganization of the troops and the defense situation in accordance with the order. The troops have now been reorganized into two divisions. The former 17th Route Army Headquarters has been cancelled in accordance with the order, and the headquarters is also being reduced in size. In the Northwest, after Director Gu conveyed the Central Government's intentions and Chairman Chiang's great spirit of public loyalty and patriotism, the military and civilians were greatly inspired and further strengthened their sincere support. Now that the country is unified, the only way to consolidate the Central Government and obey the leader is to achieve national salvation by resisting the enemy. Today, there is no so-called Northwest problem. The will and wishes of the military and civilians in the Northwest have been completely unified. They only know how to support the leader and defend against aggression. They will do their best to be loyal to anyone who is beneficial to the country. Director Yang also said that the disaster situation in Shaanxi is very serious, and he hopes that the Central Government will allocate funds for relief. When I pass through Shanghai, I plan to visit the President to pay my respects. Whether I will go to Xikou to visit Mr. Zhang Hanxiang in the future will be decided after arriving in Hangzhou. Finally, Director Yang said that he originally intended to keep this trip a secret, but in the end, he was found out. He only has admiration for himself. According to Chairman Yu, who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, he came here after being summoned by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to go to Hangzhou to listen to instructions and report on the troop transfer situation. Part of the old Northeast Army has arrived at the defense location designated by the Central Government, and part is still on the way. The 51st Army, which he leads, is also opening up to Shaanxi from Gansu. It will be transported eastward by Longhai train from Xianyang on the 10th of next month. As for the opening date and defense location of the two cavalry divisions under the jurisdiction of Army Commander He Zhuguo, he still needs to ask the Central Government for instructions. All the transfer matters of the old Northeast Army will be completed within the next month. Whether I will go to Xikou to visit Mr. Zhang Hanqing this time will have to wait until I arrive in Hangzhou. I plan to return to Shaanxi after finishing my business in Zhejiang, and then go to Bengbu for defense. Later, he said that Gansu was suffering from a strange disaster, and the people had difficulty in spring plowing. He came here to ask the Central Government to find a way to provide relief. As for the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu, Director Gu is responsible for handling it, and it is now in place. In the future, there will be no so-called Northwest problem. The only thing is that the whole country should be united, obey the Central Government, consolidate unity, and strive to resist the enemy and survive. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xi'an] Yu Xuezhong and Yang Hucheng, in response to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's call, passed through Nanjing and flew to Shanghai and then to Hangzhou on the Euro-Asia No. 18 plane at 11:25 AM on the 28th. Zhang Puquan, Gu Zhutong, Sun Weiru, He Zhuguo, Peng Zhaoshi and other important military and political leaders of the province all went to the airport to see them off. After Yu arrived at the airport, he shook hands with the welcoming staff such as Zhang and Gu and said goodbye. Then he boarded the plane and took off to the east amid the welcoming music. Yu told the reporter that he was going to Hangzhou to meet with the Chairman and ask for instructions, and report on the troop transfer. The Zhang troops are now being transferred according to the planned plan, and the troops have arrived at their new defense areas one after another.

<h3>Future of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The call for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has surged once again since the arrival of the Kodama Kenji mission to China, creating quite a stir.  Anti-Japanese banquets have given way to reciprocal receptions, with toasts exchanged and hosts and guests alike enjoying themselves. Since the Mukden Incident, military power has been expanding and the atmosphere of war has been pervasive, leaving the thread of friendship between the two countries hanging by a mere thread. How fortunate that this group of business leaders, standing from a purely national standpoint and bearing the mission of conducting on-the-ground investigations, are seeking to promote economic cooperation and adjust the relationship between the two countries. Where opportunity lies, sincerity follows. Changing course is not inherently difficult. We, as a nation that deeply loves peace, certainly welcome them with heartfelt sincerity. Now that Kodama and his party have concluded their mission in Shanghai, they embarked on their return journey to Japan yesterday, intending to report the results of this trip to their countrymen. Whether economic cooperation will achieve a bright future and whether Sino-Japanese relations can transition to a smooth and peaceful path are matters of extreme concern to the people of our country. Let me venture a speculative analysis based on my limited perspective.</p>
<p>Our country is renowned throughout the world for its vast land and abundant resources. The fullness of its forests and mountains, and the richness of its mineral deposits are sufficient for self-sufficiency and to provide for others. Unfortunately, years of unrest have resulted in accumulated distress, with a lack of both technology and capital. Consequently, vast quantities of resources remain untapped. Should friendly foreign parties come seeking cooperation, willing to employ talent from Chu in Jin and jointly pursue development, we should certainly welcome them with open arms. However, at this juncture, there is one principle that must be adhered to: that is, the principle of mutual benefit and equality. Equality safeguards our sovereignty from decline, while mutual benefit lies in increasing the welfare of both parties. Even ordinary people entrusted with tasks understand this principle. How could it possibly be overlooked in international affairs? The British Ambassador, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, at a banquet of the Hong Kong Southwestern Club, once stated that only equality can foster friendship between China and Britain, and that they were very willing to assist in China's development in a spirit of cooperation. He seemed to deeply understand this point, which is why he spoke so earnestly. And Kodama Kenji, before embarking on his trip to China, also expressed extremely earnest sentiments. Firstly, he stated that in politics, they firmly respect China's territory and sovereignty. Secondly, he said that in economics, they strictly maintain mutual benefit and equality between the two countries. Only in this way, he argued, can one speak of cooperation, and only in this way can one expect improvement in the relationship between the two countries. Our desire for assistance is so earnest, and their sincerity in engaging with us is so thorough. Therefore, after this round of interactions, there should be no reason why we cannot achieve harmonious cooperation. However, since Kodama's arrival in Shanghai, the Japanese atmosphere has been rather pessimistic. Newspaper opinions have been largely dissatisfied, and Kodama's public statements have also seemed somewhat restrained. Is there an underlying reason for this?</p>
<p>We should be aware that while organizations in Beijing and Shanghai are enthusiastically welcoming the Japanese delegation, and while Kodama Kenji is delivering his amicable speeches with composure, what is being reflected in actions and facts elsewhere? Military departments are holding closed-door meetings, and staff officers and military attachés are rushing about making connections. This is one phenomenon. Rogue elements are stubbornly engaging in smuggling, customs officials are being beaten, and railway workers are being injured. This is another phenomenon. Who is behind these actions? Who is condoning them? While advocating for unified diplomacy, the actual discrepancies are so great. Can this be something that even Kodama and his group find difficult to explain? It is well said that Kato, a member of the delegation, stated in Tianjin, "The reason why we have been unable to break the deadlock is, in part, due to the North China issue. After the delegation returns home, based on the information we have gathered, we will sincerely inform the people of our country that they should consider the actual situation and properly handle the China policy." Therefore, the future of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation will depend on the efforts of the Kodama mission after they return home. There is no need for us to belabor the point further today.</p>
<h3>Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi to Invite Party Members into Cabinet</h3>
<p>Minister to be Appointed to Railway and Colonial Affairs Portfolio, Atmosphere Between Political Parties and Military Reportedly Easing</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The positions of Minister of Education, Minister of Railways, and Minister of Colonial Affairs in the current cabinet remain vacant. It is rumored that Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro will continue to concurrently hold the position of Minister of Education. As for the other two ministries, dedicated ministers will be selected from the Minseito and Seiyukai parties after the Diet adjourns on the 31st. When Hayashi Senjuro formed his cabinet, he rejected the inclusion of political party members due to the perceived antagonism between political parties and the military. However, since Yuki took office as Minister of Finance and Ikeda succeeded as President of the Bank of Japan, the Hayashi cabinet has been regarded as one where financial cliques and the military are mutually supportive. This sentiment is naturally reflected in the attitude of political parties. Although some members of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties have individually raised sharp questions during the Diet session, both parties have, in practice, supported the various important bills proposed by the government. Two weeks ago, Prime Minister Hayashi expressed the opinion that the antagonism between the military and political parties at the time of cabinet formation had greatly eased. This implied an invitation for members of political parties to fill the vacant ministerial posts. However, Hayashi Senjuro still hopes for the emergence of a new political party, namely the government party being contemplated by various parties, so that he can select dedicated ministers from among them. Recently, although many members of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties have been engaged in movements to form a new party, its realization has been delayed due to the slim hope of securing a majority of seats in the Diet. It is reported that Prime Minister Hayashi has now decided to select dedicated ministers for the Railways and Colonial Affairs ministries from the existing two parties in order to reduce the potential conflicts that may arise during the drafting of new and stronger policies after the Diet adjourns. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Hayashi plans to actively proceed with strengthening the cabinet after the Diet adjourns, and to appoint ministers for Education, Railways, and Colonial Affairs in April. According to the Prime Minister, the positions of Minister of Railways and Minister of Colonial Affairs will be entrusted to figures from political parties, while the Minister of Education is expected to be found from the House of Peers. The government experienced various inconveniences in this Diet session due to the lack of communication with political parties. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to establish emotional ties with political parties before the next Diet session opens. Prime Minister Hayashi will likely begin negotiations with political parties from April onwards, requesting them to send representatives to join the cabinet. The results of this may have subtle repercussions on the political landscape due to its connection with the new party movement. The government's actions after the Diet adjourns are particularly noteworthy. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Only Three Days Remaining in Japanese Diet Session</h3>
<p>Fifty-Three Bills Yet to be Voted On</p>
<p>[Tokyo] With only three days remaining in the current Diet session, only thirty of the eighty-three government bills have been passed by both houses. The remaining fifty-three bills remain stalled in both houses, with the prospects for the Farmland Act and the Iron and Steel Business Act, among others, appearing rather bleak. While the tariff amendment bill has some hope of passing after revisions, the future of the export control bill is uncertain due to the undecided attitude of the political parties. In light of this situation, the government has decided to urge both houses to expedite the deliberation of the various bills. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The central agenda items of the current Diet session, the general budget bill for the next fiscal year and the special account budget bill, passed the Budget Committee of the House of Peers on the 27th. They are scheduled to be submitted to the plenary session for discussion on the 29th and will be passed along with the supplementary budget bill. Furthermore, the six tax increase-related bills also passed the House of Peers on the 27th. Currently, the only budget-related issue awaiting resolution is the tariff bill. Although various difficulties have arisen due to the undecided revision policy for the export control bill, it is expected to pass the House of Representatives within a day or two. Thus, the Diet is gradually approaching a grand finale. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Air Force Can Bomb Tokyo in Three Hours</h3>
<p>Mizuno Inquires in Japanese House of Peers</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Peers convened at 10:30 AM today. The government submitted the bill to issue additional public bonds for Showa 12 (1937) and the amendment bill to the Bank of Japan Gold Purchase Law. After Finance Minister Ketsugi explained the reasons, they were entrusted to the Deficit Bond Committee. Next, the Air Defense Bill was submitted, and Interior Minister Kawarada explained the reasons. Yoshitsu Asada of the Koseikai posed four questions: First, why does the government not obligate the general public to participate in aviation duties? Second, does the military intend to command civilian air defense, and does it intend to requisition civilian aviation in the event of an emergency? Third, are there differences in command and supervision between peacetime air defense and wartime air defense? Fourth, is the formation of air defense solely under the supervision of the Interior Minister sufficient?</p>
<p>Interior Minister Kawarada replied that training is currently being conducted for the general public, but it is not mandatory. This bill limits obligations to those with special skills. All air defense that does not belong to the military is managed by this law. In the future, an Air Defense Ministry will be established to oversee air defense operations. Temporarily, the Ministry of Interior will oversee and liaise with various prefectural agencies to ensure thoroughness.</p>
<p>Army Minister Sugiyama replied that in the event of war and when necessary for national defense, civilian aviation will also be placed under the command of the air defense commander.</p>
<p>Next, Jinjiro Mizuno of the Koyukai took the floor and asked: It is said that the Soviet air force can reach Tokyo, Nagoya, and Osaka in three hours and conduct air raids. Although this bill aims to train civilian air defense, I sincerely hope that the army and navy will also strengthen their air forces.</p>
<p>Army Minister Sugiyama replied that the authorities are currently considering establishing a powerful aviation agency and are also planning to research methods to strengthen the air force with relevant ministries.</p>
<p>Navy Minister Yonai replied that strengthening the air force is currently an urgent task. Regarding the establishment of an Aviation Ministry, he intends to study the matter with various ministries. (Domei News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>United States Adopts Big Battleship, Big Gun Policy</h3>
<p>Battleships to be Equipped with Sixteen-Inch Guns; Britain and America Find Japan's Attitude Unremarkable</p>
<p>[Washington] According to an official announcement today, the United States will begin construction of two battleships this summer, equipped with sixteen-inch heavy guns. The United States already has three battleships equipped with sixteen-inch heavy guns: the Maryland, the Colorado, and the West Virginia. Japan's recent official rejection of the fourteen-inch gun limit is considered unremarkable here, and no official comments have been released. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Naval authorities here are maintaining strict secrecy regarding the gun caliber issue for the two new battleships and are unwilling to offer any criticism before Japan officially notifies its rejection of the fourteen-inch gun limit. However, it is said that if the Navy Department does not use nine sixteen-inch guns, it will use twelve fourteen-inch guns, divided into three rows of four guns each. This is a newly invented construction method. It is understood that naval officers favor using fourteen-inch guns to reduce weight and increase speed. However, the two ships were originally designed for a speed of only twenty-seven knots, so the Navy Department may adopt sixteen-inch guns, which remains uncertain. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Japanese government has recently informed the British government that it rejects the fourteen-inch gun limit for battleships, but no notification has yet been received here. Naval circles, because news from Tokyo has been circulating for some time, stating that Japan is now planning to build battleships of 35,000 tons or more, even up to 50,000 tons, and equip them with sixteen-inch guns, are therefore not surprised by the news. Recently, naval authorities have studied the possibility of equipping 35,000-ton battleships with sixteen-inch guns. The results show that the range is not much different from that of fourteen-inch guns, while the latter is lighter. Therefore, naval experts generally favor fourteen-inch guns. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the issue of the fourteen-inch gun limit for battleships stipulated in the Anglo-French-American naval treaty, the Japanese government has submitted a note to the British government rejecting this limit. British naval circles are commenting on this matter, recalling the statement made by First Lord of the Admiralty Sir Samuel Hoare in the House of Commons the other day, and stating that equipping 35,000-ton battleships with fourteen-inch guns can save weight and increase armor thickness, thereby strengthening the battleships' resistance to artillery fire. Conversely, if the gun caliber is increased, the armor must be thinned, which will affect its resistance to artillery fire. This is the reason why Britain supports fourteen-inch guns. According to news from Japan, the Japanese Navy Department is now planning to build battleships of 35,000 tons or more. If so, then Britain should also build battleships of 35,000 tons or more and equip them with sixteen-inch guns. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] The Admiralty announced today that Britain has begun building sixteen destroyers of 1,650 tons, with a speed of thirty-six knots. It is said that the ships will be equipped with six-inch and 4.7-inch guns. Eight of them are part of the 1936 construction plan, while the rest belong to this year's plan. A plan to add forty destroyers within two years has been approved. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>American Workers Demand Recognition of Unions</h3>
<p>Government Does Not Interfere in Labor Strife</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt has returned to the White House today after a two-week vacation at Warm Springs, preparing to immediately discuss labor issues with congressional leaders and hold meetings with the Judiciary Committees of the Senate and House of Representatives. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Senate Democratic Leader Robinson, after meeting with President Roosevelt today, released a statement here explaining the central government's attitude towards domestic strike incidents. He stated that the central government cannot interfere with the current sit-down strike because, according to the Constitution, the central government has no right to interfere with strikes unless 1) damage to central assets, 2) violation of central laws, or 3) a request for assistance from the state government to maintain law and order occurs. Since none of these developments have occurred, and the labor unrest is showing considerable progress, there is even less need for interference. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt, after resting for two weeks at Warm Springs, Georgia, has recently returned to Washington. He immediately contacted congressional leaders. Those he met with today included Speaker of the House Bankhead, House Democratic Leader Rayburn, Senate President (Vice President) Garner, and Senate Democratic Leader Robinson. The President also met with Labor Secretary Perkins to discuss the labor unrest issue. Regarding this matter, the President has no intention of proposing new legislation. Political figures are paying close attention to the issue of striking workers occupying factory buildings. Some congressmen, due to the unevenness of existing state laws, intend to ask the federal Congress to pass new legislation to standardize them. However, many are still concerned that the Supreme Court may use the pretext of infringing on the legislative powers of the states and consider it a violation of the Federal Constitution. Therefore, the country's attention is focused on the Supreme Court reorganization bill previously proposed by the President as a fundamental solution. Regarding this point, officials have recently stated that the President prefers to wait for a clear expression of national opinion and does not want to urge Congress to submit it for discussion. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Detroit: The most recent development in the "sit-down strike" wave in the American automobile industry is the request by the United Automobile Workers (UAW) to the court to order the Chrysler factory to recognize the UAW as the sole bargaining agent for negotiations with employees. According to the Wagner Labor Relations Act, any factory where the number of union members among the employees constitutes a majority can serve as the sole representative agency for the workers. UAW members account for an absolute majority of Chrysler factory employees. Therefore, based on this law, they have requested the court to order the Chrysler factory not to violate it. However, the US Supreme Court is still considering the legality of the Wagner Act itself. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Labor Unrest in Malaya May Be Resolved</h3>
<p>Many Chinese Coal Miners Return to Work</p>
<p>Kuala Lumpur: There is a good sign that the labor unrest in Malaya may be generally resolved. Six thousand Chinese workers at the Batu Arang coal mine have mostly returned to work today after an agreement to establish a 10% wage increase. The troops dispatched to the area after a clash on Friday are expected to be withdrawn tomorrow. Many of the strikers at the Nilgiri Sembilan rubber estate have indicated their willingness to return to work under police protection. (Central News Agency dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Non-Intervention in Spanish Civil War Land and Sea Monitoring Plan Gradually Takes Effect</h3>
<p>British and French Navies Prepare to Provide Backup; French Warship Intercepts Volunteers for First Time</p>
<p>[London] French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos held talks with British Ambassador to France Sir Eric Phipps on the 25th of this month, mutually explaining the positions that Britain and France should adopt on the issue of non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War, and discussing various measures to intercept foreign volunteers continuing to head to Spain and prevent them from landing in that country. However, it is generally believed here that the task of the navy implementing surveillance measures should be limited to proving that the non-intervention agreement has been violated, and should not hastily engage in interception to avoid causing serious incidents. The authorities of both countries actively consulted again today, and it is reported that agreement has been reached on the following four points:</p>
<p>1.  Britain and France have no discrepancies in their opinions on the Spanish issue.</p>
<p>2.  Regarding the violation of the non-intervention agreement, there is currently no news sufficient to absolutely convince one that it is true.</p>
<p>3.  However, if it is proven in the future that the non-intervention agreement has indeed been violated, Britain and France will always consider the situation "extremely serious."</p>
<p>4.  Britain and France will continue to exchange views continuously. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] According to views from influential sources in London, no violations of the agreement have occurred since the establishment of the Non-Intervention Committee's ban on volunteers going to Spain. The claim that certain countries intend to violate it is also unbelievable. The Monitoring Committee has now begun work to make the agreement effective, and both Britain and France intend to make its work effective in the shortest possible time. Therefore, there is currently no need to take other steps to prevent volunteers from going to Spain, nor are there any recommendations. (Central News Agency dispatch, Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The semi-official Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia recently reported that the Italian government had recently provided assurances to Britain regarding its attitude towards the Spanish issue, stating that Italy had no intention of sending troops to Spain. The British cabinet was aware of this assurance during its cabinet meeting on the 24th of this month. The next day, French Foreign Minister Yvon Delbos met with British Ambassador to France Sir Eric Phipps and suggested that Britain and France cooperate to prevent foreign volunteers from going to Spain, but Britain did not accept. This is the reason. According to general opinion, the assurance mentioned by Il Giornale d'Italia was likely the one given by Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano to British Ambassador Sir Eric Drummond during their meeting on the 22nd of this month. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] A spokesman for the Italian Embassy here today denied that Italy had reiterated its assurance to Britain that it would not send more troops to Spain, and solemnly stated that Italy had already banned troops from going to Spain in accordance with the international neutrality agreement. If there were additional assurances, it would cause one to doubt the sincerity of Italy's previous ban. This point should be clarified. British officials have confirmed Italy's denial, stating that "the Daily Telegraph's claim that Italy had assured Britain that it would prohibit volunteers from going to Spain and expressed its readiness to discuss the withdrawal of foreign troops from the ranks of the Spanish rebels is purely fabricated." At the same time, it is understood that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has instructed Ambassador Grandi to refuse to discuss the withdrawal of volunteers already in Spain, and there has been no change. Today, a spokesman for the Italian Embassy also stated that Grandi's rejection of discussions on this issue had already produced the current result. However, after two weeks or a month, it may be possible to discuss it. Italy has complied with the agreement and prohibited troops from going to Spain, and Britain has no reason to assume that Italy intends to violate the non-intervention agreement. The Times of London commented on this matter with much sarcasm, saying that now that new Italian volunteers are ready to depart, everyone knows it, so everyone here feels that Rome has violated the neutrality agreement. The Manchester Guardian also made similar statements, saying, "The war in Spain is no longer a civil war. The future status of the western Mediterranean has become a problem, and this is where the crisis lies." (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Today, a French warship officially used force to implement the non-intervention agreement, preventing volunteers from going to Spain. The intercepted ship was a French merchant ship carrying twenty-five volunteers, including several Americans. After learning of this, the French warship fired a shot at the ship, ordering it to return to Port Vendres and hand over the volunteers to the police. (National News Agency dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Perpignan: Among the twenty-five volunteers intercepted yesterday by the coast guard vessel "Serbel" on the ship "Incomparable" were thirteen Americans, five Canadians, three Hungarians, two Irishmen, and two Romanians. All carried American passports, which had been signed by the French Consul General in New York. The Consul General had added a note stating that the passport was not valid for Spain. The volunteers stated that they wished to travel to Spain for tourism and not to participate in the war. (Central News Agency dispatch, Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Easter Mass Held at the Vatican</h3>
<p>The Pope Personally Blesses Believers - Spain Enacts Holy Truce</p>
<p>Vatican City - This morning, a Papal Mass was held at St. Peter's Basilica. Approximately 60,000 believers attended, including a large number of foreigners. The diplomatic section was also full, though no personnel from the German Embassy in the Holy See were present. Pope Pius XI also attended; this was his first public appearance since his illness. Many believers rushed inside as soon as the basilica doors opened in the early morning, eager to take their seats and await the Pope's arrival. When the Pope entered from the rear of the basilica, the crowd erupted in cheers, shouting "Long live the Pope!" The Pope, dressed in his vestments, ascended the throne and raised his right hand to bless the believers, entrusting Cardinal Tisserant with conducting the Mass. At that time, over 200,000 people were still outside the basilica in the square. A giant loudspeaker was used to broadcast the service. At 12:30 PM, the Pope reappeared on the balcony to bless the crowd in the square. The crowd cheered upon seeing him, and the Pope was so moved that he wept. He then withdrew inside. (Havas, Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Despite many Parisians leaving the capital for the Easter holiday, masses were held in all churches. A constant stream of believers attended. At Notre Dame Cathedral, Cardinal Verdier of the Paris diocese personally conducted the Papal Mass, which was particularly well-attended. A continuous flow of foreigners came to visit the sights. All major thoroughfares and historical sites were thronged with tourists. The cafes and hotels were also full. (Havas, Central News Agency, 28th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Heavy snow continued here this morning, preventing the usual Easter religious processions from taking place. Several excursions were canceled. Most people preferred to stay in the city due to the heavy snowfall rather than take trips to the countryside. As a result, movie theaters and playhouses were packed. In addition, a textile exhibition also attracted many people. On Monday, the French and German national soccer teams will compete. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar - The Spanish southern port of Malaga held a religious procession yesterday, Good Friday. At that time, a warship outside the port opened fire, shelling the area for half an hour. Three people were killed and many were injured. It is generally believed that the ship was the government cruiser "Jaime I." (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[London] The Sunday papers have commented on the Spanish Civil War, stating that the Easter "holy truce" and the planned land border surveillance in Spain are stabilizing factors for the European situation. The Times commented on the close cooperation between England and France, stating, "According to information from responsible sources here, there is no discrepancy in the views of England and France, and this is also the case on the border." The Observer reported, "The real problem lies within the Adjustment Committee. Internal strife among the member countries of the committee has begun to resurface." In reality, the most urgent matter is the swift implementation of the land border surveillance plan in Spain. "If the member countries of the Adjustment Committee remain divided, this surveillance plan cannot be realized." The French government's moderate approach is commendable.

<h3>French Ship Attacked in Spanish Waters</h3>
<p>Carrying Chinese Laborers and a Secretary from the Embassy</p>
<p>Marseilles - The French shipping company Chargeurs Réunis' passenger ship "Emile Littre" arrived here at 10:30 this morning after being attacked yesterday by the Spanish rebel cruiser "Canarias" off the coast of Alicante. A large crowd of citizens waited at the docks. Police immediately boarded the ship to check passports. There were 436 refugees, 23 Chinese laborers, 48 members of the rebel militia, and a secretary from the Chinese Embassy in Spain, traveling on this ship to France.

<h3>British Parliament Member Proposes Salary Increase</h3>
<p>To £500</p>
<p>[London] Prime Minister Baldwin recently submitted a bill to Parliament requesting that the annual salary of cabinet ministers be increased to £5,000 and the Prime Minister's salary to £10,000. Regarding this matter, some members of the House of Commons are now advocating for an increase in the salaries of lower house members as well. According to the Evening Standard, many in the House of Commons are requesting an increase to £500. Currently, members of the lower house receive an annual salary of only £400 and free travel to and from their constituencies and London. They do not enjoy any other benefits.

<h3>Indian People's Party Refuses to Cooperate with Government</h3>
<p>Provincial Governments Unable to Form - Concrete Expression of Opposition to the Constitution</p>
<p>New Delhi - In provinces where the People's Party holds a majority in recent provincial assembly elections, difficulties have arisen in forming provincial governments because the governors refuse to guarantee that they will not exercise the special powers granted to them under the new constitution. After the leader of the Bombay People's Party refused to form a provincial government, the leader of the Madras People's Party has also refused to accept government positions. The leader of the Orissa People's Party has telegraphed the governor, stating that the chances of forming a provincial government are now slim. Nehru, the general secretary of the People's Party, commented on these developments, saying that he is very pleased with the current trend and that the People's Party intends to proceed in this manner so that the constitution will soon come to an end. The Governor of Bombay Province, Lord Brabourne, also issued a statement today, saying that although he is willing to waive the obligations stipulated in the Government of India Act, he does not have the authority to do so. However, he has assured the leaders of the People's Party that if they form a government, they will receive all possible assistance, sympathy, and cooperation within the scope of the law. He expressed regret over the People's Party's decision to refuse to form a provincial government, but said that the People's Party's demands are difficult to fulfill under the constitution, so the People's Party must bear the responsibility for insisting on their demands. Other groups are now attempting to form a coalition government in light of the People's Party's decision. It is reported that Sir Abdoola Haroon, the leader of the All-India Muslim Federation, will meet with the governor tomorrow. (Special Dispatch, Tzu Lin Pao, 27th)</p>
<h3>Near East Nations to Sign Treaty</h3>
<p>Final Obstacle to Be Resolved</p>
<p>[Berlin] According to a special Cairo dispatch in the Berliner Tageblatt, Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan will soon sign a treaty. After this treaty is signed, these four countries will become a strong bloc. According to the Turkish Foreign Minister, the treaty will be signed in the Iraqi capital, and the King of Iraq has expressed his support. The report goes on to say that two years ago, Iraq refused to participate in such a Near East alliance, but since the military coup in Iraq and the reconciliation with England, it has apparently decided on a new policy direction, and this is why England supports the signing of this treaty. It is generally believed in Iraq that the final obstacle to signing the treaty, namely the border dispute between Iraq and Iran, will soon be resolved. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister to Visit Turkish Capital</h3>
<p>To Conclude Friendship Treaty</p>
<p>[Rome] Foreign Minister Count Ciano, having completed the signing of a political and economic agreement in the Yugoslav capital, returned home by plane today. He arrived here at 2:45 PM and went immediately to pay his respects to Prime Minister Mussolini and report to him. (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Foreign Minister Count Ciano returned to Rome this afternoon and immediately paid his respects to Prime Minister Mussolini to report on his visit to the Yugoslav capital. Political figures say that Count Ciano's trip to Ankara, the Turkish capital, at the end of April now seems certain. But they point out that Ciano must wait until the Turkish Prime Minister and Foreign Minister reciprocate the visit to Yugoslavia before he can make the trip, as it is believed here that the Turkish Prime Minister's negotiations in Yugoslavia are a precursor to Italian-Turkish negotiations, which are extremely important for Mediterranean policy.

<h3>British Independent Labour Party Annual Conference</h3>
<p>Attacks Monarchical System</p>
<p>[London] The Independent Labour Party recently held its annual conference in Glasgow, Scotland. MP Maxton delivered a speech, vehemently attacking the British monarchical system. He described the abdication of Edward VIII, saying, "The impression this matter made on the public was extremely commonplace, which shows that the people do not care about the monarchical system, and what we see is indeed correct. The abdicated king was the most beloved and greatest monarch in this country, but he was dismissed like a servant, and another servant could be summoned to replace him within 24 hours. This situation can be clearly seen in the actions of Prime Minister Baldwin and the National Government." Maxton then appealed to the Labour Party, advocating that all left-wing parties should form a united front. He also mentioned the Labour Party Executive Committee's expulsion of the party's left-wing leader, Sir Stafford Cripps, saying, "We cannot accept this decision of the Labour Party Executive Committee as final, but we must ask Labour Party members to express their opinions responsibly."

<h3>British Treasury Allocates Agricultural and Industrial Subsidies</h3>
<p>[London] Before Parliament adjourned on Thursday, the Treasury Department answered a question from a member of the House of Commons, saying that from October 1931 to the end of this month, the Treasury has allocated a total of £38,786,000 in subsidies to British agriculture and industry, distributed as follows: sugar beet £17,720,000, livestock £9,921,400, milk £4,996,400, herring £78,800, general shipping £3,998,300, civil aviation £2,018,200, mechanical transport £13,300.

<h3>Czech Prime Minister Visits Austrian Prime Minister</h3>
<p>In-Depth Discussion of Various Issues - Austrian Prime Minister to Visit Italy Early Next Month</p>
<p>[Vienna] Czech Prime Minister Hodža, visiting Austria in a private capacity, paid a visit to Prime Minister Schuschnigg yesterday afternoon, holding talks that lasted until the evening. It is reported that the two engaged in an in-depth discussion of various issues. Well-informed sources say that the Czech Prime Minister's visit to Austria was conceived more than a month ago and was not caused by recent diplomatic activities in Central Europe and the Balkans. Furthermore, Prime Minister Schuschnigg's frequent interactions with key figures in the Czech and Hungarian authorities should not be seen as evidence of the imminent collapse of the Danube countries' alliance. Responsible sources believe that the current cooperation between Austria and other countries will be maintained, which is undoubtedly certain. The Rome Protocols between Italy, Austria, and Hungary recognize that Austria can cooperate with its neighboring countries within reasonable limits, so Prime Minister Schuschnigg is skillfully using flexible means to achieve closer ties with the Czech Republic, which does not conflict with the Rome Protocols. In addition, Schuschnigg recently published an article in Die Welt, firmly stating that Austria is unwavering in its adherence to existing treaties and that Austria's own fate should be decided by itself. This article, published after the meeting with Hodža, is noteworthy. (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>[Vienna] The date of Prime Minister Schuschnigg's visit to Italy to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini is reported to be in early April, but the exact date has not yet been determined. An Austrian economic delegation is scheduled to go to Rome in mid-April to hold new economic talks with Italian authorities on a broad basis. (Havas, Central News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Vienna</p>
<p>It is stated here that Prime Minister Schuschnigg will visit Italian Prime Minister Mussolini in the near future (early April) to discuss Austria's attitude towards the German-Italian axis. According to sources here, Austria seems to be showing a tendency to distance itself from the German-Italian axis due to its desire for independence and freedom, as stated by semi-official figures. The Vienna Newspaper's Easter Special issue contained a key article on this subject, written by Prime Minister Schuschnigg. It briefly stated that Austria must have independence and freedom in order to solve all problems. It went on to say that Germany is planning to send a business delegation to Rome in mid-April to conduct new negotiations. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Cang County Incident</h3>
<p>Armed Koreans Smuggled Goods and Fired on Our Police - Provincial Government Investigation Confirms No Responsibility</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence - Since the resolution of the Fengtai Incident last year, although there have been occasional disturbances by Japanese ruffians in Hebei Province, the authorities have always managed to resolve them in a timely manner. However, recently, an incident occurred involving armed Japanese ruffians smuggling goods and clashing with the security police in Cang County. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>The Occurrence of the Incident - The incident occurred around 1:00 PM on March 11th when several security police officers from Cang County were patrolling in the Jiuzhou area of the county. They saw two suspicious-looking trucks carrying goods coming from the west. They immediately ordered them to stop for inspection, but the trucks ignored the order and sped past. The security police then fired at the tires to stop them from proceeding. The Koreans on the trucks also opened fire and began shooting. At this point, the police officers, acting in self-defense, had no choice but to take cover by the roadside and return fire. After about an hour of exchanging fire, the smugglers surrendered. Upon inspection, the police found that three Koreans had been injured by mistake. They also found 28 bags of smuggled white sugar in the trucks, proving that they were engaged in armed smuggling. The injured Koreans and the smuggled sugar were handed over to the Cang County Commissioner's Office. One of the injured Koreans died due to the severity of his injuries. The other two injured Koreans were sent to the hospital by the Commissioner's Office and are no longer in critical condition.</p>
<p>The Provincial Government's Handling - After the incident, Li Guojun, the magistrate of Cang County and concurrent Administrative Inspector of the 7th District, telegraphed the provincial government to report the truth of the matter. After receiving the report, the provincial government, in order to understand the details, specially dispatched Japanese language advisor Chen Qingyun to Cang County to investigate everything. It is reported that Chen has completely investigated and clarified the details of the incident and has taken several photos of the scene. He has returned to the province to report. The provincial government believes that it has been determined that this incident was indeed caused by illegal smuggling by Japanese ruffians, and the security police were acting in self-defense, which was appropriate. In addition to ordering Li Guojun to handle the matter according to the law, the provincial government also instructed Li to explain the true situation to the Japanese side when they send personnel to investigate, so that the Japanese side can understand the truth. As for the rumors that the Japanese side intends to lodge a protest with the provincial government, the provincial government has not yet received any official communication from the Japanese side and believes that if the Japanese side investigates the situation thoroughly, there will be no need to lodge a protest, as the Koreans' injuries and death were their own fault.</p>
<p>The Japanese Side's Investigation - The Japanese consulate in Tianjin reportedly sent personnel to investigate after the incident. Japanese newspapers in Tianjin and Beijing have repeatedly stated that the Japanese side is taking the matter seriously and that the Japanese side intends to formally lodge a protest with the provincial government and, under the pretext of this incident, demand the establishment of a Japanese police station in Cang County. All of this is Japanese propaganda. The provincial government believes that this incident was caused by armed smuggling by Japanese ruffians. Local police officers have the responsibility to protect the area and assist in combating smuggling. Their mistake in injuring the Japanese ruffians while performing their duties was purely a display of dedication and responsibility. If the Japanese side lodges a protest due to a misunderstanding of the truth, the provincial government will definitely state everything according to reason. (March 27th)</p>
<h3>Traitor Shao Hanqing Still Secretly Negotiating the Sale of Reclaimed Salt Flats</h3>
<p>A Merchant from a Certain Country Using the Pretext of Perpetual Lease to Purchase Land In and Around Tianjin</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence - There are over 80,000 acres of abandoned reclaimed salt flats in the Hangu and Xinhe areas east of Tianjin. Under the instigation of the traitor Yin Rugeng, Shao Hanqing has been selling them to a certain party. People here are paying close attention to this matter, as it involves the sale of national territory. Shao Hanqing is still in a certain concession in Tianjin, negotiating with the other party, but he is acting very secretly to avoid attracting attention, as the matter has not yet reached the stage of signing a contract. Shao Hanqing recently claimed that he is not the representative of the seller and that although there is another representative of the land owner, they are only forming a paper mill company with foreign merchants (referring to the certain party) and there is absolutely no sale of land. His words are very vague and difficult to believe. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the truth and report it to the Ministry of Finance for verification, the Changlu Salt Transport Envoy Office, based on the petitions from salt flat households in the Hangu and Xinhe areas, sent a special representative to Beijing on the morning of the 26th to explain everything to the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. The Hangu and Xinhe areas are under the jurisdiction of Tianjin and Ninghe counties. The Tianjin Municipal Government has ordered the Tianjin District Administrative Commissioner's Office and the Tangda Police Bureau to thoroughly investigate the truth of the case of selling national territory so that it can negotiate to stop it. According to Tianjin Municipal Government Secretary-General Ma Yanchong, "In recent years, merchants from a certain country have been perpetually leasing a lot of land inside and outside the city. There are already several places in the Special First and Fourth Districts (former German and Belgian concessions). Now, merchants from a certain country want to expand the tactic of perpetually leasing land to the Tianjin and Dagukou areas. Foreign merchants are allowed to perpetually lease land in commercial port areas for industrial and commercial purposes, but it is questionable whether the example of commercial ports can be applied to areas outside commercial ports and whether foreign merchants can be allowed to perpetually lease land. The Municipal Government has requested instructions from the Central Government and has reported the details here for verification."</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi Oppose Guangdong's Exemption of Taxes on Imported Rice</h3>
<p>Appointed Representatives to Gather in Beijing to Petition the Central Government - Agricultural and Grain Associations in Wuhan to Meet to Discuss Response</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence - Regarding the rice shortage in Guangdong Province, the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui have been supplying it as much as possible, and special rice trains have been running on the Yuehan Railway. Although the rice shortage has not been completely resolved, it has been slightly alleviated due to the assistance of the provinces. During this period, the rumor that Guangdong Province would completely exempt import taxes on foreign rice suddenly became widespread, causing alarm among grain merchants in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, and Jiangxi. They decided to appoint representatives to gather in Beijing on the 30th to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry to stop it. Grain merchants in Shanghai are also participating in the appeal. In order to vigorously fight this case, the Wuhan Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association and the Agricultural Association also convened a joint meeting on the 27th and resolved the following: 1. The associations will jointly appoint representatives to go to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and ask Huang Wenzhi to accompany the bureau to petition the provincial and municipal governments, and ask the provincial and municipal governments to telegraph the Central Government to stop the exemption as soon as possible. 2. The grain merchants will jointly appoint three representatives to go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance. Huang Yunxiang, Bao Junan, and Xie Qianmao were appointed as the representatives to go to Beijing to petition. After the meeting, Agricultural Association representatives Lin Yaoqin and Han Qinnyu, grain industry representatives Li Bingjun and Deng Xizhou, and grain store representatives Huang Yunxiang, Chen Shulin, Dai Yongzhao, Yao Weizhang, Bao Junan, Hu Zuliang, and Yu Qisheng invited Municipal Chamber of Commerce Chairman Huang Wenzhi to visit Huang Shaohong, urging him to telegraph the Central Government to stop the exemption. The representatives to Beijing, Huang Yunqing and others, took the Longan Wheel to Beijing on the evening of the 27th. At the same time, they telegraphed President Jiang of the Executive Yuan and the national press to appeal. The text of the telegram to President Jiang of the Executive Yuan is as follows: "We have learned that last year, the provinces along the Yangtze River had bumper harvests, while Guangdong Province reported a rice shortage. The government, weighing surpluses and deficits, adjusted food supplies. It is appropriate to use the surplus rice production from the Yangtze River to supplement the grain shortage in Guangdong Province. In one transfer, not only can the southern famine be alleviated, but the four provinces in central China can also share the benefits and increase prosperity. However, some officials and merchants in Guangdong Province have failed to see this and have only requested tax exemptions on foreign rice. They do not know that if foreign rice is exempted from taxes, rice prices will inevitably plummet, leading to the farmers being harmed by cheap grain. Farmers across the country will inevitably suffer cruel sacrifices. Moreover, when deficits increase and taxes decrease, the massive import of foreign rice will inevitably increase the trade deficit and affect the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund. The consequences are unimaginable. The Association, seeing this, telegraphed Your Excellency and the Ministries of Finance and Industry on New Year's Day, pleading our case. We then received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating that the Guangdong Province is currently allowed to pay half of the tax on imported foreign rice in cash and record the other half in an account, and has not been exempted from taxes. The merchants should purchase as much domestic rice as possible and transport it to Guangdong for relief. The Association immediately called on the Wuhan industry to purchase as much rice as possible and transport it to Guangdong, and so far, more than 600,000 dan has been transported, and more than one million dan is still waiting to be transported. During this period of congested cargo transportation, it was suddenly reported that the Ministry of Finance in Guangdong Province intended to exempt the remaining tax on imported foreign rice. According to a telephone call from the Association's Guangzhou branch, the foreign rice tax exemption will be implemented on the 1st of next month. The news spread, and rice prices immediately fell. The impact will not only leave millions of dollars of the Association's industry's capital in despair, but also the rural prosperity of central China will be lost. Thinking of Your Excellency's concern for people's livelihood and consideration for farmers and merchants, the methods for adjusting food supplies and overall planning have long been discussed and decided, and will never be changed halfway. We urge you to strictly prohibit the tax exemption on foreign rice based on existing cases, telegraph it to stop it, and order the Guangdong Provincial Government to strictly prohibit rumors, maintain rice prices, so that a large amount of domestic rice will not be rejected for no reason, and the rural finance of the four provinces in central China will not collapse again. Sincerely presented, we await your orders. The Wuhan Miscellaneous Grain, Oil Cake Industry Association."</p>
<h3>Shandong Provincial Government Plans to Develop the Taian Huabao Coal Mine</h3>
<p>The mine can produce a thousand tons per day and be mined for thirty years. The provincial government plans to build a railway to facilitate transportation. Dakou will become the economic center of southern Shandong.</p>
<p>Jinan Communication: South of Taian County, there is the Huabin Coal Mine, which has been mined for more than twenty years. Due to small capital and low output, it has not attracted outside attention. In addition, it is too far from the Jinpu Railway, making transportation difficult and increasing costs, resulting in little hope for external development. Recently, operations have been stalled due to disagreements among shareholders. Coincidentally, the provincial government initiated the establishment of the Shandong Industrial Company, planning to jointly operate by the government and private sectors, raising 20 million yuan to develop industries and increase local production. Therefore, it planned to take over the mine and expand its operations. The Construction Department dispatched technician Yu Wudan to conduct a survey. The results showed great potential. The provincial government then sent Yu to organize a management office, with Yu serving as the director, and the takeover has been completed. The quality of the coal is very good, containing 12% sulfur, with high calorific value, suitable for steelmaking, and is one of the best in the country. The reserves are also very deep. In the past twenty years, due to improper management, only seventy or eighty tons were produced daily. According to accurate estimates, if the daily output reaches 1,000 tons in the future, it can be mined for thirty years. However, to continue mining, the first priority should be to facilitate transportation in order to develop externally. The provincial government has now decided to build a railway to meet this need. The Jinpu Railway passes through Taian, tens of miles away from the mine. If a branch line is built from Qiyao Station between Dakou and Nanyi, passing through Tianjiayuan, Dongciyao, Jingquanzhuang, Beigucheng, Xihanzhuang, Poguo, Taipingzhuang, Yanzhuang, and Nanyucun, to Huabao Coal Mine, the total length will be 40 Chinese miles. The estimated cost is about 800,000 yuan. In the future, it is planned to extend eastward, passing through Gongguo, Guli, to Suncun. If it is extended further, it can reach Mengyin County via Wennan. This section is about 50 Chinese miles long. If this road is completed, not only will Huabin Coal Mine benefit, but also the Huafeng Coal Mine north of Dongciyao and the Xinyu Coal Mine in Suncun will benefit. Developing the treasures of southern Shandong, this road has great economic value. Dakou is originally a distribution center for local products in southern Shandong. With this railway, it can further control the economic center of southern Shandong. It is reported that Yu Wudan recently plans to go to Beijing to discuss everything with the Ministry of Railways.</p>

<p>Doctor Rapes Female Opium Smoker</p>
<p>Hua Guojun, a resident of Maoziqiao in the northern countryside of our county, has been working in the education field. His eldest daughter, Jinglan, 26 years old, graduated from the Provincial No. 2 Women's Normal School. Several years ago, she married someone surnamed Guo and has a daughter, 4 years old. However, Jinglan suffered from hysteria during childbirth due to physical weakness and fetal gas. When someone told her that opium could cure it, she smoked a little, and her symptoms improved. When the government handled the self-renewal registration for opium smokers, Jinglan changed her name to Guo Zixin and obtained a self-renewal license from the county government. On September 26 last year, Jinglan was again summoned to the county rehabilitation center for treatment. She was discharged from the hospital on October 9 after quitting. On the 27th of last month, Jinglan went to the rehabilitation center for examination according to law. However, Zheng Fuxu, a doctor at the center, saw that she was beautiful and became lustful. That night, he tiptoed into Jinglan's room to attempt rape. After she called for help, she was not defiled. Zheng said hatefully, "I will send you to court tomorrow." On the 23rd of this month, he accused Jinglan of possessing poison and sent her to the county government. Jinglan publicly stated in the waiting room of the county government the inside story of the rehabilitation center and the attempted rape by doctor Zheng Fuxu, and sent a letter to her father, Hua Guojun, for instructions. The news spread, causing a sensation in society. Jinglan was then sent to the security headquarters of the district. After a detailed interrogation by military judge Li, Jinglan truthfully confessed. The military judge ordered her to submit a supplementary statement so that the matter could be investigated. Jinglan's father learned of the situation and submitted a petition to the special commissioner's office, requesting a thorough investigation. The county government believed that the truth of the case should be thoroughly investigated and sent the head of the first section, Li Shou Xuan, the head of the second section, Huang Fu, and the head of the third section, Xu Yingtu, to the county rehabilitation center to investigate the truth for verification. In addition, the county anti-smoking association has reported the information to the provincial anti-smoking association. It is reported that the doctor has been in office for one year, and attempted to rape Ms. Wang for the first time, raped Wang Suzhen for the second time, raped Gu Jingou for the third time, and attempted to rape Hua Jinglan for the fourth time. There are as many as thirteen people who have been raped. The district headquarters has issued a warrant to detain the principal offender, doctor Zheng, for legal action.</p>

<p>Villagers and Refugees Brawl</p>
<p>Between Baiwen Town and Weicunling in the fourth district of Wu County, there are more than 100 refugees from Hubei who have been eating vegetarian food at the home of Xu Jindao, the richest man in Xujiagang Village. Xu also solicited white rice from his neighbors on their behalf. At this time, more than ten refugees freely entered and exited his house. Later, the Xu family discovered that more than 80 yuan hidden beside the pillow had disappeared. They reported to the town chief, Wang Zikang, and asked him to find a way to recover the money. After persuasion, fearing an accident, he let it go. Unexpectedly, this was known to unscrupulous people who gathered more than a hundred people to chase after the refugees. Knowing that things were not good, the refugees rushed to the farmers' homes to seize agricultural tools. At Jiutiangou, the two sides fought each other. Although the police station in Weicun sent police to suppress the fight, they could not stop it, resulting in the death of a refugee named Chen Desheng on the spot, and more than ten people were injured on both sides. Afterwards, the refugee representative, Chen Yiren, led the injured to the local court on the 27th to examine the injuries and requested that someone be sent to the countryside to examine the body.</p>

<p>Completion of the Temple and Tomb of Wan Jiye</p>
<p>Wan Jiye, a Zhejiang sage from Siming, completed the draft of the History of Ming as a commoner in the historical bureau. His scholarship and integrity have long been a model for the Confucian world. His tomb in Chunhu, Fenghua, has been neglected for a long time and has become desolate. Zhuang Songfu and Jiang Mengxiang and others from Fenghua initiated the renovation. In addition to renovating the tomb passage, they also rebuilt the Wan Temple next to it and purchased sacrificial land for permanent sacrifices. It was completed in early April. It is now scheduled to hold the completion ceremony of the temple and tomb on the morning of April 1. The special affairs office has notified senior scholars and scholars inside and outside the province to participate. Special buses are available in Yin County for transportation.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Chief Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>With utmost respect, I have read the article "Banpu Communication" in your newspaper, which states that the Lianghuai Transportation Department and the Audit Branch Office of Banpu are soliciting merchants to contract for the Anhui-Henan shore loading and storage supervision project for the 26th year. The article mentions that in February of the 25th year, the Lianghuai Transportation Department announced the measures for the shore loading and storage supervision and tax payment to solicit merchants to contract. At that time, a few so-called old merchants failed to achieve their desire to monopolize the contracting and fabricated criticisms in the name of the Transportation Merchants Association. After reading this, I was deeply shocked and surprised. This association is organized by all colleagues. Every matter is decided by the general meeting of all members. There is no distinction between new and superior merchants. The merits and demerits of the dispute over shore loading and storage supervision have their own fixed evaluation and do not need to be elaborated. However, all matters are listed under the names of individual transportation merchants, which can be verified. This association takes public opinion as its own opinion and cannot make any claims. It has not been falsely claimed by anyone. The above sections are not factual. I am afraid that they will confuse listeners and readers, so I hereby request a correction and hope that it will be published in the letter column. I wish you good health.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>The Huai Salt Transportation Merchants Association of the Port, March 25th.</p>
<h3>Autumn and Spring</h3>
<p>— Zhou Liangchao</p>
<p>"A frequently used door hinge does not decay, and flowing water does not become polluted, because they are constantly 'moving'." These few words provide us with a concise and essential revelation, which is to say, "movement" and life are interdependent: "Movement" is life, and life must involve "movement"; without "movement," not only is there no life to speak of, it's practically not human!</p>
<p>However, beneath all forms of "movement," there exists a divergence between "gain" and "loss"; "movement" that is methodical, meaningful, valuable, and benefits society, which is influenced by your "movement," is "gain"; "movement" that is base, undisciplined, purely selfish, engaging in destruction, deception, trickery, disruption, barbarity... is "loss." Therefore, we should not "move" unless we have to. If we hope that in the process of "movement," we can irrigate our precious lives with fertile nourishment, allowing them to blossom into splendid flowers, then, when we stand at the crossroads of "gain" and "loss," we must stand firm, use our keen eyesight, unwavering will, indomitable spirit, and the courage to cut through thorns and brambles, and move forward towards our determined goals. In this way, the result of "movement" will bring you the comfort of a victorious smile; otherwise, "movement" is driving you to excavate and bury your own tomb, giving you destruction, leaving you no chance for rebirth!</p>
<p>Therefore, we must not believe that "we have the freedom to exert 'movement' and control 'movement'"; we must understand that the gain and loss of each of our lives is controlled by the grasp of "movement."</p>
<p>My conclusion is: to live, you must "move"; meaningless, reckless "movement" is the "moving" state of "walking corpses," the ugly "movement" of "appearing and disappearing like ghosts"; holding a burning torch, undertaking the task of national recovery, this is our righteous "movement."</p>
<h3>Clothing Buttons</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>Clothing buttons on women's outer garments, such as cheongsams, seem to be merely accessories, but from an aesthetic standpoint, they cannot be ignored. Recently, I heard some advice from a dressmaker. He said that clothing buttons are to clothes what eyebrows are to a person's face. Although the position of the eyebrows is always fixed, women's eyebrows can be willow-leaf shaped, wire-shaped, moth-eyebrow shaped, phoenix-tail shaped, even Garbo-style and Clara Bow-style, endlessly varied. In short, they vary in style depending on the contours of each person's face to enhance their beauty. Clothing buttons are also like this. Although their position on the clothes is fixed, their density and length must vary according to each person's figure to achieve harmony. At the same time, one must also consider the color and pattern of the fabric, and strive to match the pattern of the clothing buttons. If all aspects are harmonious, then, like eyebrows on a woman's face, they will further enhance the charm of the appearance. If two good cheongsams are matched with incongruous clothing buttons, it is like a beautiful face with two brush-like eyebrows, which would spoil the scenery.</p>
<p>In fact, our country's women have only been paying attention to the importance of clothing buttons for the past ten years. Before that, cheongsams were not popular, and most clothing buttons were the so-called straight-shank buttons. If someone put on a set of simple coil-shaped buttons, it was considered very elaborate. However, no attention was paid to whether the style of the clothes, the color of the fabric, and other factors were harmonious with the pattern of the clothing buttons. In these ten years, women's love of beauty has made great progress, so in these ten years, the pattern of clothing buttons and the density of the buckles on cheongsams have been exhausted to the extreme. When making a new garment, most modern women often discuss the clothing buttons with the dressmaker and spend a lot of effort designing them. According to that dressmaker I know, this is not entirely meaningless, because clothing buttons, if designed carefully, are enough to take the place of lace. In this year of striving to simplify pattern lines, a cheongsam with only a simple row of clothing buttons on the right is enough to express its elegance and generosity, which is many times more beautiful than adding sluggish lace. However, according to that dressmaker, even this harmonious, simple, and up-to-date clothing button takes a lot of effort to design.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Guan Nong Garden</h3>
<p>— Yu Jun</p>
<p>In spring, I felt slightly unwell, and my illness lingered for more than a month. The beautiful spring scenery was inevitably disappointing. Yesterday, the weather cleared up, and I suddenly had the urge to travel. So, I took a streetcar and stopped at the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohujing, West Shanghai. That day happened to be a Sunday, so there were many fellow travelers, with the fragrance of clothes and hair, heel to toe. In front of the Wangmei Pavilion, a Song plum tree, with ancient and clumsy branches, was covered with flowers, with a slightly green color, very different from the ordinary, quite clever and wonderful. Looking at its label, it was moved from Huayuangang, Hangzhou the year before last. It is said to be an antique from the imperial garden of King Kang of the Song Dynasty, which makes it even more precious.</p>
<p>Looking around the garden, the treetops were newly green, the willows had sprouted buds, and the gentle breeze blew, making the scene harmonious and pleasant. I couldn't help but feel the fullness of spring. After walking around for a week, I had tea in the shady Green Shade Cottage. As soon as I sat down, I met the owner of the garden, Mr. Xi, and chatted with him for a while. He then guided me to visit the Fish Paradise, with hundreds of sand jars and thousands of koi, which was a spectacular sight. Mr. Xi told me that the fish had been fed since the thaw. This year, the weather is warm, and the fish's bellies are already bulging. In another week or two, they will have to chase each other and scatter their eggs. In midwinter of last year, I visited Yangzhou and saw the famous fish raised by Mr. Liang Si, the owner of the Sanhe Canned Food Company. The fish were large and of noble breeds, including several pairs of "pearls," seven or eight inches long, with pearls as big as peas, each of which could be counted, which was delightful to behold. Furthermore, the water in which they raised the fish was clear and bottomless, and the scales of the fish were clearly visible as they swam in it. I asked Mr. Liang about this, and he said that this was the northern method. Northerners keep the water clear for raising fish so that the fish's body can be seen. It is not like the southerners who like to use green water. The clarity or greenness of the water has nothing to do with the fish's body, but we can watch them in clear water without the trouble of scooping them out. Mr. Xi appreciated his remarks and discussed with Mr. Liang, asking him to find a northern fish servant. He has recently come to the garden, so the water in the jars here can also be seen at a glance. I saw that it was indeed true. I returned and recorded it to tell those who love raising fish.</p>

<h3>Mated Mandarin Ducks</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12 White boards nailed to the case return two lines of tears in vain; in the autumn, reeds and maple leaves alone roam half the city.</p>
<p>Between dignity, there was a hint of charm. Xiao Song saw Guoqi looking at this female student, seeming to be a little shy, and suddenly slowed down his pace. This made him think of the poem, could this be the person described? As the various speculations continued, the young lady had already walked in front of them. She was not at all shy, as the poem described, but rather stood still generously and nodded with a smile at Guoqi, softly calling him "cousin." Guoqi, in response to her generous gesture, also returned the courtesy with a nod, and they passed each other. Xiao Song waited until she had walked far away before saying with a smile: "So that's your relative." Guoqi replied: "Yes, but a distant one, we don't interact much." Xiao Song thought to himself, who asked you whether you interact or not? The two walked silently for a few steps until they reached the entrance. Xiao Song said: "Are you going to do something on the street, or are you seeing me off?" Guoqi said: "Seeing you off for a few steps." Xiao Song said: "You can stop here. Go back and write a few more poems, and I'll come to learn from you next time." In his heart, Guoqi was thinking that Ms. Li Youmei must have passed by and gone to his house. Since that time he misunderstood her, she was probably a little embarrassed and had never come again. Girls are more sensitive than boys, so he should go home and entertain her, to cover up this incident. So he hurriedly walked home, thinking that Youmei must be in his mother's room, and deliberately made up some excuses to go in, but there were no guests inside. He muttered to himself, she was so unconcerned about suspicion, had she gone to his study again? He steadied himself, opened the curtain slowly, and went in. He thought that this composure would not startle her. But when he went in and looked, there was still no one in the room. This was strange, could she have passed by without entering? Alas! Unintentionally, he had failed another person. So he took the manuscript of the poem, held it in his hands, leaned back in the chair, and began to recite it slowly. Suddenly, he heard someone knocking on the glass window with a bang. Guoqi looked back and saw a fair white face flash, and she smiled: "Isn't this Miss Li?" Youmei nodded a few times outside and said with a smile: "I came a long time ago. But I saw my cousin seeing a guest off, and I didn't know when my cousin would return, so I took a few turns in the alley. I only came when I saw you enter the door. You're writing poetry again, am I being a little presumptuous by coming?" (150)</p>
<h3>Record of Human Sorrow 1</h3>
<p>— Zhou Shoujuan</p>
<p>On March 17, the 26th year of the Republic of China, Zhou Jianrong fell into a pond while cycling in the small garden and died. I and my wife Fengjun were heartbroken by this tragic event, and our tears were exhausted; Zhou Rong was the same age as Wang Qi, his death was not for the country, but it was Heaven's doing, what can we say! It has been more than ten days since my Rong'er passed away: I am saddened by the things around me, and I cannot control myself, so I write it down to vent my sorrow.</p>
<p>Rong'er, whose courtesy name was Zhongmei, was the third son and a sophomore at Soochow Middle School. Although he was not very intelligent, he was quite diligent in his studies; he was meek and obedient, and could be filial to his parents at home, and could please his teachers at school. Many classmates were also close to him. He loved art, and at the age of twelve, he liked to carve stones and make name seals; his handicrafts and paintings were quite impressive. He especially loved Boy Scout work, and was skilled in flag signaling, cooking, sewing, and buttoning; he participated in almost every inspection in the town. He was less than sixteen years old, but he was as tall and strong as someone in his twenties, and his clothes and shoes could be exchanged with mine and his elder brother's. My old mother is seventy years old, and she was happy to see him grow up so much. How could she know that in the blink of an eye, Heaven would take my beloved son away!</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 17th, I was writing at the Shen Bao, and at about three o'clock, I suddenly felt restless and wanted to return to Suzhou. I took the special express train at four o'clock, and at about six o'clock, I drove to the Ning's house, where I suddenly saw Fengjun crying outside the door, saying that Rong'er had fallen into the water; I was shocked and terrified, and rushed in to hear that Rong'er had already been rescued by the servants and was leaning on Hua Ding's shoulder, spitting out water like a tide. I still thought he could be saved, and hurriedly asked Dr. Li Guangdong and Dr. Xu of Bo Xi Hospital to come and give him life-saving injections and artificial respiration: I also personally gave him breath, trying to continue his life. But human effort could not match the work of Heaven. Since Heaven was determined to call Rong'er back, no human power could save him, because Rong'er had long since passed away after being taken out of the water. I held his head tightly and shouted Rong'er's name repeatedly, but he did not respond to me. Although he died violently, his face looked as if he was alive, peacefully asleep; his whole body was not swollen, and his muscles were firm as before. Alas, alas, how could I bear to see the culmination of more than ten years of hard work thrown into the land of birds? At that time, my old mother was in Shanghai, and only returned after a few days, and did not have time to see her beloved grandson. She cried day and night, calling Rong'er's name, and the depression in her old heart can be imagined.</p>
<p>Rong'er was encoffined on the 18th. When the coffin was to be sealed in the afternoon, the wind and rain were heavy, as if Heaven was also shedding tears for him; and Rong'er went on his journey in this mournful wind and rain. I plan to bury him in the Xiu Valley Cemetery after the Qingming Festival, and from then on, he will be far away from his family and sleep alone at the foot of Mount Lingyan. In the windy mornings and moonlit nights, who will he be with? I only hope that the spirit will show great compassion and protect this pitiful child, and not let him be humiliated by evil spirits.</p>
<p>Rong'er's tragic accident seemed to have a premonition. At about ten o'clock on the night of the sixteenth, the family had already gone to bed. I was sitting alone under the lamp editing "Spring and Autumn," when I suddenly saw Rong slowly getting out of bed and heading straight to the outer room; I was surprised and asked why, and Rong said he wanted to find a book. I thought it was a nightmare, and hurriedly helped him back to bed, and touched his forehead, which was as warm as usual. Rong smiled at me and fell asleep again, and I didn't think much of it. After he died, my eldest son, Zheng, checked his belongings and saw the Shaeffer fountain pen that he used every day. It had been sewn tightly together, as if he had foreseen that he was about to die violently and would no longer be able to use it. Also, according to one of his classmates, Rong was writing an article in school that afternoon, and finished it in one stroke, looking very hurried; when asked why, he said that he felt confused and wanted to go home quickly. Who would have thought that he would meet with misfortune an hour after returning home. Alas, is there really Heaven in this?</p>
<h3>Jade</h3>
<p>— Nángōng Shēng</p>
<p>Jade is a type of mineral that is found in the southwestern provinces of China. Before being cut open, it is a large piece of mountain rock with a deep yellow outer skin, concealing the green jade within. Jade merchants must be experienced with discerning eyes when purchasing jade stones, because it's not possible to cut open the stone and study the amount of jade inside. Therefore, one can only rely on their vision and luck. If a piece of mountain rock is found containing much green and translucent jade, it is not difficult to get rich; otherwise, there will be losses. Therefore, we often hear stories of jade merchants who become wealthy or bankrupt from buying jade stones.</p>
<p>The best jade stone is called "Dàngxīn Green." When the outer skin of this mountain rock is removed, green jade is revealed, reaching all the way to the core. The deeper it goes, the greener and more transparent it becomes, almost entirely jade, making it the best kind of jade stone. Unfortunately, only a few pieces can be found like this out of hundreds of jade stones. The remaining jade stones mostly have less jade. Within a stone, even having a five-inch square piece of glass jade is enough to gain substantial profits.</p>
<p>There is specialized knowledge for cutting open jade stones. People experienced in cutting jade can cut it out completely without breaking it into fragments. Therefore, when one obtains a piece of jade stone, it must be inspected by a technician to avoid unexpected damage.</p>
<p>The value of jade lies in the quality of the green color and the brightness of its luster. The quality is determined by these two aspects. Good jade is green and transparent, like green glass, hence the name "Glass Jade." If the green color is lighter and darker, it is considered second-grade. Colors that are like lake green and not transparent are the worst kind. Jade that has black spots or white lines inside is also not considered good. However, there is a type of jade that is green and transparent like glass, but evenly covered with black stars, called "Plum Blossom Green," which is also a valuable type because it is a rare and fine product.</p>
<p>The use of jade is only as ornaments and decorations. In modern times, the most common uses are rings, bracelets, watch stems, and buttons. Jade is also carved into toys and display items, such as the jade pagoda in a jade exhibition, which is a type of display item.</p>
<h3>A Series of Jokes</h3>
<p>— Xiàolín</p>
<p>A Liú developed red eyes, was afraid of bright light, and often shed tears, but he did not seek medical treatment. One day, he went to a relative's house to offer congratulations. Because he saw the bright light, tears streamed down again. His brother-in-law jokingly said to him, "Why are you crying at a place of celebration?" This embarrassed A Liú greatly, and he quickly explained, "I'm not crying; my eyes are hurting and tearing up." Then, his brother-in-law said earnestly, "Since you have an eye disease, you should use 'Bright Eyes Eye Drops' from the Wuzhou Pharmacy, and your eye disease can be cured sooner."</p>
<p>Yān Cóng Did Not Quit</p>
<p>The government banned smoking vigorously, so Boss Zhao also quit his smoking habit. He proudly boasted to his friends that he was decisive, but his friends did not believe that he had quit smoking because his teeth were still as black as before. Later, he learned about a type of "131" toothpaste that contained medicinal effects and could whiten teeth and remove stains. After purchasing and using it, the black color gradually faded, and his teeth became clean and beautiful.</p>

<h3>Shanghai China Basketball Team Again Achieves a Great Victory Over Amateurs in Beijing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Leading from start to finish with 36 to 25. The final outcome will be known next month when the Beijing United team visits Shanghai.</p>
<p>▲ Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th. The Liu-Kang tournament between the Shanghai China Basketball Team and the amateur team was performed at the Amateur Association at 3 PM on the 28th. There were more than 1,000 spectators. The amateur team was missing Li Zhenzhong, plus they were not practicing enough, resulting in a failure with a score of 25 to 36. The five players from the China team showed excellent cooperation. Their advance and retreat were well-organized. With Feng Nianhua and Wang Nanzhen as forward and guard respectively, they can be considered unparalleled. Zhou Dayun's left-handed shooting seemed divinely inspired, scoring the most points. Other players also performed their duties effectively. Their victory was not by chance. In the National Games, the Shanghai team will be a strong enemy for Beijing and Tianjin. Besides Tang Binkun and Liu Zhenyuan, who were as active as before, the two guards Yin and Zhang from the amateur team were very sluggish, with loopholes appearing from time to time. Gong Bangjie's playing style was different and incompatible. Wu Bixian was excellent, but unfortunately only played half the game. Otherwise, the outcome might have been different. To know the actual strength between Beijing and Shanghai, we will find out when the Beijing United team visits Shanghai next month. The China team members returned to Shanghai on the night train. The lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>The game started at 3 PM. Zhang Dongping and Xu Zheng served as referees. Liu Zhenyuan and Zhang Jingshi scored first (0 to 4). Feng Nianhua tied the score (4 to 4). Zhou Dayun scored three times in a row (10 to 4). After that, Tang Binkun and Feng Nianhua each scored. The amateur team remained at a disadvantage. In the first half, 23 to 11, China established a foundation. In the second half, Wu Bixian entered the game, and the two sides were evenly matched. Although Tang Binkun was extremely active, he was outnumbered. Yin Hongxiang and Zhang Jingshi frequently missed opportunities, ultimately leading to defeat. As a result, 36 to 25, China won triumphantly.</p>
<h3>The Finale of Tianjin-Shanghai Interport Football: Tianjin Team to Play Military Joint Team Today</h3>
<p>▲ The clash will be at Yiyuan at 3 PM</p>
<p>The final act of the Tianjin-Shanghai interport football, the match between the Tianjin team and the Shanghai Military Joint Team, is scheduled to take place at Yiyuan Stadium at 3 PM today. The referee is Bott, and the linesmen are He Chunhui and Shen Huichun. The Military Joint Team is actually the British Royal Army and Labor teams. Their usual coordination is more skillful than a temporarily assembled team. Therefore, Yates' defense, Neller's supply, Schabells' shooting, Tuiler's hook passes, and Whiting's activity can be fully displayed. Their forward line is the sharpest among the Shanghai teams. Their mid-defense is also tight, which will reduce the activity of the Tianjin team's forwards. The Tianjin team also feels the seriousness of this match. Therefore, their main players Jiang Yuehansheng and Tan Fuzhen are specially rested to show their skills. The entire team has also had a full day of rest to recover from their fatigue. According to Jiang Yuehansheng, the lineup for today's match will be the same as the championship match the day before. Zhang Xueyao will still not be present. The intensity and excitement of this match can be predicted to be more powerful than the championship match the day before and the China-Liu match the day before yesterday. The Tianjin team is scheduled to take the Shanghai-Ping express train departing at 12:00 tonight to return north to Tianjin. The lineups for both sides are as follows:</p>
<h3>The World Games Organizing Committee Has Major Disagreements</h3>
<p>▲ The Mayor of Tokyo and the Sports Association are in a state of opposition.</p>
<p>▲ Mayor Ushizuka Disregards the Head of the Athletics Department, Mr. Gō Takashi</p>
<p>▲ The House of Representatives Has Approved a Subsidy of 4.3 Million</p>
<p>(Tokyo Special Dispatch) The issue of the Japanese government's subsidy for the 12th World Games has been the focus of concern for the local authorities, the Sports Association, and the World Games Organizing Committee in recent days. On the 20th, the House of Representatives Budget Committee submitted a supplementary budget proposal. Kōno Ichirō of the Seiyūkai, Katsuta Eikichi of the Minseitō, Prime Minister Hayashi Senjūrō, who also holds the post of Minister of Education, and Vice-Minister of Education Kawahara, had sharp questions. After much debate, the government subsidy of 4.3 million yen was finally approved. Hayashi proclaimed that Japan's preparation for the World Games should be carried out as a national undertaking, so that the conference could proceed on a bright path. The atmosphere of the venue was strengthened. The situation of all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Mayor Ushizuka Protests</p>
<p>Kōno Ichirō of the Seiyūkai first questioned whether the World Games Charter (rules) went against Japan's national sentiment. Mayor Ushizuka of Tokyo expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Organizing Committee, stating that it was unreasonable for Tokyo to bear the huge cost of preparing for the World Games. Although it can proceed under the specific policy of the government subsidy of 4.3 million yen, why has a certain university that has been excluded from the sports community suddenly become active in the Organizing Committee's decision to hold the conference in Tokyo? Is the Organizing Committee becoming bureaucratic? If this continues, it will be impossible to proceed three years later. Therefore, he protested to the Ministry of Education. Vice-Minister of Education (Deputy Minister of Education) Kawahara replied that there were indeed many disputes within the committee, but he hoped that it would enter a state of complete agreement in the future. The Organizing Committee may not necessarily recognize the structure of affairs and can deliberate at length.</p>
<p>Construction is Permanent</p>
<p>Next, Chairman Katsuta Eikichi of the Tennis Association spoke, saying that Germany regards the World Games as a national undertaking, while the United States regards the World Games as a private organization's affair. But how should Japan view the World Games held in London? Prime Minister Hayashi replied that the World Games is not a matter for the national government, but the state must strive to provide assistance. Katsuta asked about the allocation of the total budget of 15 million yen, including 10 million yen for construction costs and 5 million yen for conference expenses. He inquired whether this construction was permanent or temporary, and what its purpose was. Vice-Minister of Education Kawahara replied that it was not a temporary construction, but a permanent one to enhance national physical education. Kodama, Director of the Shrine Bureau of the Ministry of Interior (Director of the Altar and Temple Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Interior), said that the Ministry of Interior is planning a large-scale movement field centered on the Outer Garden of Meiji Shrine.</p>
<p>Emphasis on Specialized Technology</p>
<p>Katsuta continued that there are currently few sports groups participating in the World Games, and the majority of government officials rarely speak, creating a state of opposition between the Sports Association and the City of Tokyo. Mayor Ushizuka has spoken excessively, leading to opposition even to Gō Takashi, the head of the athletics department who is of a specialized nature. The Mayor is purely a layman, and he is deeply concerned about obstructing the selection of personnel for the position of head of specialized athletics in this way. At the last World Games held in Berlin, President Hitler was dissatisfied with Dr. Lewald, the chairman of the organizing committee, but Lewald was the most suitable person among the sports community and specialists. Finally, President Hitler tolerated him, resulting in a good outcome. Therefore, in the future, matters of a specialized nature for the World Games should be handled by specialists, so that the organizing committee can be a powerful organization.</p>
<p>Welcome China to Participate</p>
<p>The Japanese sports community believes that the Republic of China is a major country in the Far East. Since the World Games is being held in Tokyo, Japan, in the Far East, the ancient and newly emerging Republic of China must be welcomed to participate. Any obstacles must be cleared, otherwise the sports community will inevitably be uneasy. Since the failure of the Chinese team at the 11th World Games in Berlin, the athletes have become aware, and the government authorities have also started to promote it urgently. The construction of a large sports field in Shanghai is proof. There are many rising stars among Chinese athletes, but the poor training and management methods in the sports community have led to failures. If they can prescribe the right medicine in the future, the progress of Chinese sports will be enough to shock the athletes of various countries.</p>
<p>Japan Trains Gymnastics</p>
<p>If the current World Games are held in Tokyo in three years, the host country Japan is now starting to train gymnastics. At 2 PM on the 20th, the first World Games lecture was held at the Keio University Tsunamachi Gymnasium. The period will last until the end of this month, totaling ten days. Regular lectures are scheduled to be held gradually thereafter. The summer lecture is scheduled to open in July this year. It is reported that the schools participating in this lecture are the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Waseda University, Keio University, Yokohama Higher Commercial School, Keifu, Keisho, Fuchu Sixth Middle School, and Urawa Middle School. The content of the lecture includes six types of exercises: horizontal bar, parallel bars, pommel horse, rings, vault, and freehand gymnastics. The instructors are senior alumni from various schools. The seniors Nonaka from Keio and Matsunobe from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences both participated in the guidance.</p>
<h3>West Qing Women's Volleyball Ends, Qixiu Wins Championship</h3>
<p>Second Place, Gongnü Middle School</p>
<p>The West Qing Women's Volleyball Tournament has now ended completely. The last match between Qixiu and Adi Snow White Team B was held at 2 PM the day before yesterday. As a result, because the strength of the two sides differed greatly, except for the second game, which was slightly closer due to Qixiu's casual play, the other two games ended with a complete one-sided victory. The scores for the three games were 15 to 1, 15 to 10, and 15 to 1, totaling 45 to 12. Qixiu won a great victory. Qixiu now has six wins in six games and has won the league championship. The Gongbu Bureau Girls' Middle School is in second place with five wins and one loss. Adi Snow White Team B lost all six games and is in last place. The complete results are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Ordinary Cup Football Match: South China Defeats Jiu Hua</h3>
<p>▲ Hong Kong, 28th Special Dispatch. In the Ordinary Cup match between South China and Jiu Hua on the 29th, Jiu Hua suffered a great loss of strength due to the absence of Liang Xianzhan and Yang Shuiyi. In the first half, Chen Dehui of the South team used both his feet and head to score a goal each. In the second half, Zhuo Shijin of the South team and Huang Yongkang of Jiu Hua each scored a goal, making it 3 to 1. The South team won.</p>
<h3>The Match Between Tung Wah and Portugal is Postponed</h3>
<p>▲ Yesterday, West Catch Greatly Defeated French Business</p>
<p>Today's Group A football game, originally Tung Wah versus Portugal, was to be played at the Municipal Sports Field. However, according to the latest news, due to the time of the Spring Festival, all banks are taking a holiday as usual, and most of the Tung Wah players work in the banking sector. Therefore, they went to other cities for Spring Festival travel. The match against Portugal today has been applied for postponement.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were two Group A matches, both played at Hongkou Park. As a result, in the match between Lux and West Catch, West Catch greatly boosted its strength due to the return of the famous general Xiao Tuo, who took on the role of defender. Lux, on the other hand, had four strong players missing due to Spring Festival travel: goalkeeper Ikehoff, forwards Bollinger, Greenburg, and center-back Van Meng. They were replaced by reserve players, resulting in a vast difference in strength and being unable to withstand West Catch's attack. After a fierce battle, the situation was completely in the hands of West Catch. At the end of the first half, West Catch took the lead with a score of 4 to 0. In the end, they won with a score of 9 to 2, completely avenging the shame of their 14 to 2 loss in the first round. In the other match between French Business and Su Shell, Su Shell still struggled to improve. They were behind 2 to 3 in the first half. In the second half, they were completely defeated, losing eight more goals. The final score was 11 to 2, with French Business winning a great victory.</p>
<p>West Catch Defeats Lux (A) Nine to Two</p>
<p>French High Defeats Su Shell (A) Eleven to Two</p>

<p>▲ China Aviation and East Asia Fail</p>
<p>▲ The Score is the Same: Four to Zero</p>
<p>In Chinese football, both of yesterday's matches belonged to the Chinese Character Group and were held in Jiaozhou and Hongkou Parks respectively. As a result, Shunji and Guangdong both won, overwhelming China Aviation and East Asia. The score was the same: four to zero.</p>
<p>Shunji Defeats China Aviation (Chinese) Four to Zero</p>
<p>Guangdong Defeats East Asia (Chinese) Four to Zero</p>

<p>International volleyball is the third act today, with a total of two games scheduled. Starting at 7 PM, Europe will play against Palestine. At 7:45 PM, China United will play against Italy.

Especially many local ladies and students visit. Every day, the area in front of the museum is almost full of carriages. In order to promote noble entertainment and stimulate research interest, the museum has decided to hold a second special exhibition in early April, featuring ancient jade from three dynasties and Tang Dynasty Qiong porcelain. It is said that this ancient jade collection is from Chen Danian, a famous jade collector from Guangdong. Chen's ancient jade is world-renowned. This time, he is participating in the National Art Exhibition and will pass through Shanghai to hold a preliminary exhibition. All are fine pieces collected by Chen over the years. The Tang Dynasty Qiong porcelain is from Li Ziqian of Sichuan. Porcelain fired in Dayi County was considered a top-quality product in the Tang Dynasty, with bright and clean colored glazes, exquisite beauty and simplicity, and was unprecedented. This time, Li traveled thousands of miles to Shanghai to exhibit the porcelain at the same time as the ancient jade. Both are making their first appearance to the people of Shanghai. To facilitate the appreciation and research of the general public, the museum's research department will simultaneously publish explanatory brochures in Chinese and English, providing extremely detailed explanations. It is said that this exhibition is highly valued by academic circles. In addition, due to the warmer weather and the large number of visitors, the museum will extend its daily opening hours by one hour starting April 1st, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, in accordance with regulations.

<h3>Business and Industrial Leaders Unite to Oppose Tax Increases</h3>
<p>Hope the Board of Directors Reconsiders and the Taxpayers' Meeting Rejects　Otherwise, They Are Determined to Unite to Correct the Mistake</p>
<p>The Board of Directors of the Public Concession Bureau, based on the opinions of Western directors representing a minority of citizens and a minority of taxes, ignored the sincere dissuasion of the Chinese directors representing a majority of citizens and taxes, and actually established a 2% increase in the municipal general tax, from 14% to 16%, an increase of 2.5 million yuan in the burden on citizens annually. This case has aroused serious opposition from all sectors of industry, commerce, and residents in the concession. Reporters interviewed leaders from various sectors of industry and commerce in the concession, and all expressed that the Public Concession Bureau's measures were inappropriate and should be corrected. All hope that the board of directors of the bureau will consider the actual economic situation of the society and the hard work of the citizens who have been struggling in a difficult environment for several years to seek the revitalization of the market, accept the public's opinion, and submit the case for reconsideration, so as to conform to the purpose of the municipal authorities and the citizens coexisting and prospering, and revitalizing the market under the principle of mutual cooperation. Otherwise, the future brewing situation is difficult to be optimistic. Now all citizens are holding a sincere hope that the Western Taxpayers' Meeting will reject it. At the same time, they are vigorously promoting the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Public Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the First Special District Citizens' Association, and other organizations that have close relations with industry, commerce, and citizens, to unite and prepare effective measures to jointly resist. The leaders of these organizations have exchanged views several times and decided to accept the requests of all parties, and under a unified front, correct the mistakes of the Public Concession Bureau.</p>

This time he is sent abroad, not only is the whole country very happy, but also the public opinion of various countries is deeply celebrating our country for getting the right person.

<p>Commander Yang's Farewell Speech During the banquet, Commander Yang stood up and delivered a farewell speech, saying that today representatives from all walks of life in this city are sending off Special Envoy Kong to attend the coronation ceremony of the King of England. Special Envoy Kong has made great contributions to the party and the country over the years. This time he is sent as an envoy, with Special Envoy Kong's qualifications and reputation, he will surely bring honor to the country. At the same time, Mr. Xiao Xiange is present today. Mr. Xiao is ordered to go abroad for investigation and will surely have a good harvest and contribute to the party and the country. Today, representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai are gathered together to wish Special Envoy Kong, Mr. Xiao, and all the gentlemen a healthy journey.</p>
<p>Special Envoy Kong's Speech of Thanks Chairman, gentlemen, comrades, I am ordered to go to England to congratulate the coronation of the King of England. I am very grateful to the Shanghai organizations for the joint banquet. However, since everyone loves me, I have to express my gratitude to everyone and ask for your advice. My departure is imminent. This kind of joint banquet can save a lot of time, which is especially regrettable. And I hope that in the future, farewells and welcomes will follow this method. The chairman just said many complimentary words, which are really not appropriate. I have been serving in the central government, working for the country, always holding the principle of doing my best within my ability, regardless of labor and resentment, regardless of success or failure, and I think you all know it. This time I am going to England to sincerely congratulate the coronation of the King of England. The mission is indeed important. On the one hand, we must make the relationship between the two countries more harmonious in the future. On the other hand, we must make the two major ethnic groups more friendly in the future. The words "Responsibility and Distance" written on many flags at today's banquet are indeed correct. However, social interaction is not my strength. Since I have received a heavy order, I can only strive to fulfill it, so as not to live up to this trip. Four years ago, I was ordered to go to Europe and the United States to investigate the economy. I originally wanted to stay in the United States for a while, but the domestic situation at that time did not allow it, so I returned to China in a hurry, so that various investigation and investigation plans that were set at that time could not be completed. In recent years, I have often thought of going to Europe to continue the investigation. Therefore, after attending the coronation ceremony of the King of England this time, I decided to take the opportunity to continue the investigation in various countries in continental Europe. My country has been working hard to build a modern country in recent years. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee also passed the Nine-Year Construction Plan. However, when implementing the construction, we must learn from others. Europe has made rapid progress in the past four years. If I can learn from others and make up for my shortcomings on this trip, it may not be a contribution to the country. I am not talented and knowledgeable, and one person's energy is limited. This time, I invited many counselors and commissioners to travel with me, including experts in railway construction, international trade, and economic finance. The purpose is to achieve this. Before I was ordered to go abroad, I received letters and telegrams from all parties, all expressing that I should not go abroad at this time. The general idea is that the Ministry of Finance is currently working hard on economic construction, the Central Bank is preparing to reorganize, the country's annual budget is being prepared, and the financial sector is also waiting for improvement. All of these require my leadership. On the Executive Yuan side, since the Xi'an Incident, President Chiang's health has not yet recovered, and I must also act as the Vice President to take charge of the affairs of the Executive Yuan. However, these concerns are no longer a problem, because President Chiang's health has recovered, and the ministers of the Executive Yuan can all be responsible for presiding over the affairs of their respective ministries. Under the leadership of President Chiang, the advancement of government affairs will not be stopped at all. As for the Ministry of Finance, the internal organization is still perfect, and all affairs can be carried out as usual by the person in charge. The principles of reorganizing the Central Reserve Bank have been approved by the Central Political Council, and the principles of this year's budget have also been determined. We will strive to balance revenue and expenditure for the ordinary budget, and set separate revenue and expenditure methods for construction funds. As for improving the financial situation, experts are currently studying plans to improve the banking system and assist the development of industry and commerce. This cannot be decided within one or two months. After I return to China, I can personally preside over everything. Furthermore, from the perspective of the overall national situation, unification has been completed, and the whole country can unite with one heart and one mind. The local authorities can deeply understand the intentions of the central government and pledge to obey the central authorities. The central authorities can also understand the local difficulties and do their best to guide them, so the foundation of the country is indeed consolidated. Furthermore, since the implementation of the legal tender policy, the financial sector has become more active, and the good harvest last year has also brought about the revival of the countryside, so if everyone proceeds according to the original plan, the future of the country will be brighter. Therefore, I have no worries about this trip. In the past, I have served in the country, whether as the Minister of Finance, the President of the Central Bank, or the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, or the Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission. If everyone thinks that I have achieved a little bit of success, this is not my personal strength, but the credit of the guidance and support of friends and comrades. Today, everyone present is a leader from all walks of life in Shanghai. Shanghai is the center of the country, so everyone is also an important figure in the country. This time I represent the government and the people, and it can also be said that I represent everyone, to congratulate the coronation of the King of England. I believe that everyone's help to me in charge of various matters will be more effective than when I was in the country, so I can happily embark on the journey. In addition, if everyone has anything they want me to investigate in European countries, I am also happy to accept the order. I respectfully borrow the host's wine to wish everyone good health.</p>
<p>Commissioner Xiao's Reply This time, I was ordered to go abroad to investigate industry. I am not an industrial expert, but I should take this opportunity to investigate more abroad and hope to have some achievements and return to serve as a reference for the industrial circles in my country. At the same time, I should follow Special Envoy Kong and live up to my mission. I am deeply grateful for your kindness in sending me off and wish you all good health. The banquet ended happily at 10 o'clock.</p>

A reporter from the Industrial News Agency investigated and reported as follows:</p>
<p>Planning and Preparation: Mr. Xia's planning and preparation have decided to select sites in Xining and Huangyuan, Qinghai, to establish factories. The factories will be divided into: 1. Wool Washing Department, specializing in washing wool skirts to remove impurities; 2. Disinfection Department, specializing in eliminating toxins contained in wool; 3. Inspection Department, strictly distinguishing types and setting standards; 4. Packaging Department, in addition to paying attention to beautiful decoration, it is also planned to use steam power to pack, so as to facilitate postal transportation. In addition to the above four departments, it is also planned to establish attached chemical laboratories and warehouses. It is also planned to handle wool exports in Tianjin and Shanghai. As for the construction of the wool factory, it is planned to be carried out in three phases. The first phase is to establish one factory with an estimated annual washing capacity of 1 million catties. The second phase is to establish two factories with an estimated annual washing capacity of 2 million catties. The third phase is to establish three factories with an estimated annual washing capacity of 3 million catties.</p>
<p>Completion in Five Years: This plan is divided into two-year phases and is expected to be completed in five years. When the time is right, it is planned to establish branches in commercial ports in Europe and the United States to facilitate sales and avoid foreign control. It has now been submitted to the Qinghai Provincial Government and the relevant central authorities for approval in order to proceed. It is learned that the relevant authorities also believe that China's wool exports, namely the output of Tianjin Customs, exceed 10 million yuan annually. The merchants have raised funds to establish a large-scale wool factory to recover rights and interests, which is worthy of encouragement. However, in order to be cautious, they are closely investigating the source of capital and its business plan, and plan to provide technical and economic assistance to seek its development.</p>

<h3>Various Groups Request Protest Against the Case of Japanese Rogues Injuring Customs Officers</h3>
<p>A Declaration Was Issued Yesterday and Sent to Various Public Organizations</p>
<p>Japanese rogues in this port, due to the domestic manufacture of bullets, need raw materials, secretly buy our country's copper coins and smuggle them out, plotting huge profits. On the morning of the 20th of this month, a large number of rogues used specially made giant pockets filled with copper coins and sent them to the Dayang Maru ship. They were discovered by customs anti-smuggling personnel. When they stepped forward to stop them, the rogues took out weapons and beat seven Chinese and Western customs officers. Later, a person from a certain consulate was sent to the dock to mediate, and a small portion of the smuggled copper coins was handed over. The injured customs officers were sent to the hospital for treatment separately. Afterwards, all Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling personnel issued a declaration, requesting the government to arm them, and requesting all sectors to uphold justice, to protect national rights and emphasize tax revenue, etc. The details have been seen in this newspaper. It is now learned that the Nanjing Road Business Federation, the Citizen District One Branch, the Fenghua Shanghai Fellow Association, the Western Clothing Industry Guild, and other groups jointly issued a declaration yesterday to various public organizations, saying: "China and Japan are countries of the same script and the same race. China is especially a kind and peaceful nation. Mutual respect for sovereignty and adherence to international credibility are the foundation of peace in East Asia. The expectation of coexistence and co-prosperity is also not difficult to achieve. Knowledgeable people in both countries have never failed to see this. However, with obstacles not removed, thorns are often planted on the path, and with wild ambitions not subdued, storms often arise on level ground. If unfortunately both sides are hurt, what good will it do? It is undeniable that there are many cracks in Sino-Japanese relations. Recently, enlightened neighbors, such as Mr. Kodama Kenji, came to China with sincerity to participate in the meeting of the Sino-Japanese Trade Association, singing high praises for friendship and cooperation, seemingly wanting to dispel the clouds and mists to see the light of day. However, facts are the most eloquent, and unexpected problems arise, ultimately fearing that it will be a flash in the pan and quickly become a bubble. In recent years, smuggling has been rampant in various parts of our country. Not only is the tax source suffering huge losses, but also the industrial and commercial sectors are about to go bankrupt. How can this be tolerated? Although customs anti-smuggling is meticulous, the so-called rogues are still fearless. How can this be tolerated? Shanghai is concerned with international image. The declaration of anti-smuggling personnel, this kind of accident has occurred more than ten times in succession, which destroys customs administration, obstructs national rights, and cannot be ignored any longer. All public organizations and sectors in Shanghai should rise up to uphold justice, and on the one hand, appeal to the foreign affairs and finance officials to file several protests to protect national rights, so that our merchants and people can live and work in peace, and the hope of national revival will not be destroyed halfway. This is our declaration."</p>
<h3>Former Italian Finance Minister Stefani Arrived in Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Hired as Financial Advisor to Our Government; Will Soon Transfer to Hangzhou to Pay Respects to Chairman Chiang</p>
<p>Mr. Stefani, former Italian Finance Minister, has been hired as a financial advisor to our government for a short trip. He arrived in China on the Victoria Liner in early March and arrived in Shanghai at noon today (29th). The ship docked at the northern pier of the China Merchants Bureau. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek specially sent Jiang Baili and Xue Guangqian as representatives to welcome him. Mayor Wu of this city and Secretary-General Yu, etc., will also go to welcome him. The authorities of this city originally planned to hold a grand banquet after Mr. Stefani arrived in Shanghai. Later, it was learned that Mr. Stefani's stay in Shanghai was very short and he would soon transfer to Hangzhou to pay respects to Chairman Chiang, so the banquet was temporarily postponed. According to news from our embassy in Italy, the Italian government treated Mr. Stefani extremely well when he left Italy for China. All the dignitaries went to the port to see him off, and the situation was enthusiastic, which was unprecedented. This is naturally due to Mr. Stefani's personal status and reputation, and it also shows the respect of the people of that country for the advisors hired by our country. Mr. Stefani was the first Finance Minister after the Fascist Party came to power in Italy, and he made great contributions to the initial financial reforms. He was highly valued by Mussolini. After retiring, he served as a member of the Fascist Grand Council and a National Minister of the State Council, with a very high position. At the same time, he served as the director of the Department of Political Science at the Royal University of Rome and personally taught a course in finance. Mr. Xue Guangqian, who was sent by the authorities to receive Mr. Stefani this time, was a student of his, studying wartime finance and achieving excellent results, earning the most honorable doctoral degree. He is Mr. Stefani's only outstanding student in China. Mr. Xue was originally a senior official in the Ministry of Railways. When Mr. Stefani departed from Italy, he requested Mr. Liu Wendao, our ambassador to Italy, to transfer Mr. Xue from the Ministry of Railways to study with him.</p>

<p>After the grain and bean industry groups jointly requested to prevent duty-free foreign rice from entering Guangdong, the Executive Yuan replied yesterday, ordering the Ministry of Finance to handle it. Representatives from various regions will gather in Beijing tomorrow to petition. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chiang Kai-shek's Reply Ordered the Ministry of Finance to Handle It: The Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild, the Zhaigong Association, the Grain Number Guild, the Bean and Rice Industry Guild, the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui Rice Industry Federation, etc., since learning that the central government has approved Guangdong Province to import 2 million dan of duty-free rice, the Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild and the Grain Number Guild telegraphed the Executive Yuan, Chiang Kai-shek, the previous day to request prevention. Yesterday, they received a reply: "To Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild, etc.: I have received your telegram. It has been transferred to the Ministry of Finance for handling. Zhongzheng Jian."</p>
<p>Petitioning Mayor Wu to Prevent It: Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng was ordered to be transferred to the position of Chairman of Guangdong Province and will soon depart to take office. Gu Xinyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Grain and Oil Cake Industry Guild, visited Mayor Wu yesterday morning. In addition to personally submitting a summary of the reasons for requesting to prevent duty-free foreign rice from entering Guangdong, he also stated everything, explaining that if foreign rice is allowed to enter Guangdong duty-free, the price of domestic rice will inevitably plummet, which is contrary to the government's purpose of reviving the countryside. Therefore, he requested immediate prevention. It is heard that Mayor Wu promised to investigate the facts and then handle them after taking office.</p>
<p>Joint Petition in Beijing Tomorrow: Grain merchants from Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangxi, and other places will gather in Beijing at 9:00 AM on the 30th to petition the Executive Yuan, the Central Party Department, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to prevent the duty-free import of foreign rice into Guangdong Province.

He will also go with them, it is said.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literature and Art Association Was Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>More Than 100 People, Including Wang Fuquan, Attended; Constitution and Declaration Were Approved, Etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literature and Art Association held its inaugural meeting at the YMCA in Baxianqiao at 2:00 PM yesterday. Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, Fang Zhi, Deputy Minister, Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Tong Hangbai, member of the Municipal Party Department, etc., were invited to attend and speak. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Members Attending</p>
<p>Included Wang Fuquan, Gu Zhongyi, Cao Juren, Hu Shenchi, Lu Shaofei, Dai Wangshu, Shao Xunmei, Jian Youwen, Shen Qiyu, Li Qingya, Zhang Jinglu, Xie Liuyi, Chen Zizhen, Zhao Jingshen, Zhang Menglin, Tao Kangde, Du Heng, Ruo Gu, Ye Lingfeng, Yao Sufeng, Fan Shenyun, Hu Huaichen, Zhou Jianyun, Wang Qingdong, Wen Yuanning, Zeng Die, Tang Hanmei, Huang Jingqi, Lu Danlin, Xiang Peichang, Yang Jinhao, Zhu Jingchun, Zhang Yiping, Ma Zidan, Wang Zhaoying, Jin Guangmei, Pan Zienong, Hu Xiongdong, He Xiya, Xu Wenling, Feng Youzhen, Gao Tianqi, Qian Taisheng, Wang Qitao, Wang Dingjiu, Louis, Yi Zhengfan, Lu Jiji, Xu Beichen, Zhou Duo, Ji Xizong, Chen Dongbai, and more than 100 others. Jian Youwen, representative of the Preparatory Committee, asked the conference to appoint a presidium, and Wang Fuquan, Jian Youwen, Hu Zhongchi, Zhou Jianyun, and Ye Lingfeng were elected as the presidium.</p>
<p>Opening Remarks by the Chairman: First, Chairman Jian Youwen delivered the opening remarks, saying, "Today, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Literature and Art Association is holding its inaugural meeting. I believe that all members of the literary and art community will very much agree with this organization, because at the last discussion meeting of the initiators, everyone felt that the unity of the literary and art community in the past was too weak, opinions were too divided, and feelings were not harmonious. Therefore, it has never been able to unite. Now everyone is aware of this and initiated the organization of this group. Of course, everyone agrees and is very excited. This association has been responsible for the progress of the 15 members of the Preparatory Committee. After five meetings, the charter and origins, etc., have been drafted and the association's office has also been rented at No. 631, 6th Floor, Continental Shopping Center. The origins are divided into five points, of which two are very worthy of our attention. The first point is that this association is initiated for the purpose of fully connecting feelings and exchanging knowledge. The second point is to gather all the strength, promote the national spirit, and jointly face the national crisis. Because it is entirely about connecting feelings, there is no political purpose, which will definitely eliminate the problems that prevented the healthy organization of literary and art groups in the past. Because it is about gathering the strength of the group to jointly face the national crisis, it will definitely eliminate all factions and prejudices, and fight for the interests of the entire nation and country."</p>
<p>Speech by Minister Shao: First, Shao Lizi, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, delivered a speech, saying, "Today, because I arrived late, I did not hear the chairman's report, but judging from the printed materials on the table, I know that there are now more than 120 members. Almost all the colleagues in the Shanghai literary and art community have participated. This is the first point that is commendable. Secondly, although the constitution of the Chinese Literature and Art Association does not have many articles, the organization is very meticulous. This is the second point that is commendable. What is especially commendable is that the five reasons for the establishment in the origin of this association are very thoughtful for the sake of literature and art itself, for the sake of literary and art writers themselves, and for the future of the country and the nation. I can definitely wish your association a great future. Because of the establishment of your association, the Chinese literary and art community and even the future of the entire country and nation can also be equally optimistic and have great hope. This is the third point that is commendable. The importance of literature and art to society, the nation, and the country is something that everyone present must understand better than I do, because I can only say that I am a person who loves literature and art, not a person who is engaged in literature and art. I often say that a person who is engaged in a profession must feel a special interest in this matter, have a deep understanding, and know the importance of this matter. People who are engaged in literature and art must also know the importance of literature and art, so there is no need for me to say it again. Therefore, my presence today can only express my sincerity. There is nothing to contribute, and everything that can be contributed is contained in the five reasons. Developing literature and art for the future, developing literary and artistic writers, and developing for the benefit of the country and the nation, it is really not easy to contribute any more opinions outside of these five reasons. But since I am here, I cannot but express a little sincerity. Therefore, I thought of the ancient saying 'Literature carries the Tao' to give as a gift to everyone. The saying 'Literature carries the Tao' has been opposed by some literary and artistic writers in recent years, especially those who write for the sake of literature and art. In fact, the saying itself is not bad. It is just that the word 'Tao' is mostly interpreted incorrectly. The interpretation of the word 'Tao' is originally very broad, not only the Tao of Taoist gentlemen, the Tao of Song Confucianism. The reason why many people oppose 'Literature carries the Tao' is that they misunderstand the word 'Tao' to be the Tao of Taoism. Therefore, only the words of the ancient sages can be spoken, and only articles related to the word Tao can be written. If you write that kind of article, it seems to lose the value of the text and lose your own position. In fact, there were two meanings of Tao in ancient times. One is the intangible Tao, which is the principle of how to be a human being is called Tao. The other is the tangible Tao, which is the Tao of the road we usually walk on. If we use the Tao of walking to explain 'Literature carries the Tao', it means that literature and art can indicate the road that life and the country and the nation should take. There are many avenues that life should take. What should we use to indicate them? Rely on words to indicate them. The meaning of 'literature' is broader than 'literature and art'. 'Literature and art' must be included in 'literature' and occupy an important position in 'literature'. Therefore, literature and art can move people and have the most profound and lasting power. The content of literature and art is not empty, it has substance, so it can move people. What is the substance? It is 'Tao', it is the various avenues that life should take. Therefore, the ancient people's so-called 'Literature carries the Tao' is not wrong in itself. The mistake is that later generations misunderstood the broad interpretation as the narrow sense of Tao, so it is dissatisfied by those who study literature and art. We understand this meaning, and future literary works cannot violate the road that the country, the nation, and society should take. For example, now our nation is being oppressed and bullied, and on the one hand, there are too many weaknesses in the nation itself, the spirit is depressed, and the will is scattered. Therefore, the avenue that the country, the nation, and society should take now is to demand independence, freedom, steadfastness, and unity. Therefore, the road that literary works and literary writers should take must also be the same. Now, in general, literary writers, Liu Yu, the Chinese Kuomintang and the Central Propaganda Department, have a feeling that they hope to get freedom. There must be many literary writers brewing these words in their hearts, especially those literary writers who did not attend or join this association may have this meaning even more. However, the Chinese Kuomintang is not the Fascist Party of Italy, the National Socialist Party of Germany, nor the Communist Party of Soviet Russia. Literary writers under the Chinese Kuomintang, I believe, will be able to obtain considerable freedom. But absolute freedom, unlimited freedom, I can say bluntly, will never exist, because it is already very clearly stated in the legacy of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People that only the freedom of the country and the freedom of the nation are true freedom. Under the major premise of national freedom, there is no individual freedom. It is not that individuals have no freedom, because compared with the freedom of the individual and the freedom of the country and the nation, the individual must sacrifice a little freedom. The Tao of 'Literature carries the Tao' does not necessarily take one road. There are several roads that can lead to the avenue, and there are also various means of transportation. It is not limited to taking a plane or taking a train. As long as you can reach this avenue in the same way, you are free to take whichever road you want, using one kind of tool. Originally, you can have this freedom. However, if you do not proceed along this wide road, but proceed to a very dangerous dead end, I will say bluntly that you should not have this freedom, because it is contrary to the interests of the country and the nation. For example, now the country needs unity. If someone wants to lead the general public to the road of national division, we will naturally not allow this freedom. Therefore, on the premise of not hindering national unification and not hindering national revival, you can freely take your own road. Otherwise, there is absolutely no freedom. What is the avenue that the Republic of China should take now? In the current situation, the road on the left is impassable, and the road on the right is also impassable. It is dangerous to go in. Only the road in the middle can be taken. What is the avenue in the middle? It is the avenue of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, we believe that literary writers must also proceed on the road under the Three Principles of the People and become the literature and art of the Three Principles of the People. Under the literature and art of the Three Principles of the People, there is a very free road that can be followed forward. This is a little gift that I am offering to you today. Finally, I wish you all a boundless future and the Chinese Literature and Art Association a boundless future! (To be continued)"</p>

<p>Will Stay in Beiping for Four Days to Fully Enjoy Oriental Civilization. Most Group Members are Royal Family Members, Magnates, and Journalists from Various Countries. German and French Round-the-World Cruise Ships Will Also Arrive in Shanghai One After Another.</p>

It arrived outside Wusongkou yesterday morning, but due to the large size of the ship and its deep draft, it was unable to enter the port. The Changxing Company sent small ferries to pick up the passengers. This time, the ship carried a total of six hundred and seventy-three members of the world tour group, with the aim of sightseeing in various countries around the world. Among them were entrepreneurs, bankers, philanthropists, and movie stars, such as Paul Hurst, Chairman of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce; Salmon, a goodwill ambassador of the American Rotary Club; Lady Sassoon, the wife of a British magnate; Mike, the editor-in-chief of the New York Times; the Duke of Battenfelt, a British economic expert; the Duke of Rome, a Parisian nobleman; and Levis, the American dancing king, as well as male and female tourists. Charlie Chaplin's famous American comedian brother, Sydney Chaplin, also took the ship on a world tour to relieve his loneliness due to the recent loss of his wife. The ship anchored outside Wusongkou, and the ferries Scott and Alexander took the tourists to the New Customs Wharf at 10:30 am. They then boarded pre-arranged Yunfei automobiles for a sightseeing tour of Shanghai, including visits to the City God Temple, Zhaofeng Park, and a tour of the Zhabei battlefield ruins. The tour route started from the New Customs Wharf, went north along the Bund, took Suzhou Road, turned across the Sichuan Road Bridge to Hongkou Park, went along Jiangwan Road to "New Shanghai," circled around the Municipal Government, then returned to Jiangwan Road, passed Tiantongan Station, took Binshan Road (North Henan Road, Henan Road) to Nanjing Road, turned west, went straight to Jing'an Temple, took Yuyuan Road, passed Zhaofeng Park, took Bailinan Road, Luobiegen Road, Hongqiao Road, to Haige Road, took Xiafei Road, Minguo Road, to Xinbeimenkou (guests got off the bus to visit the City God Temple, parked for about half an hour, then started again, took Tianzhutang Street, Sichuan Road, to Renji Road, directly to the Hua Ma Hotel for lunch. Free time began at 1:00 pm. A dance party was held at the Hua Ma Hotel at 4:15 pm. At 6:15 pm, they walked to the New Customs Wharf, boarded a ferry back to the original ship. The ship stayed in Shanghai for one day and then sailed to Qinhuangdao at 9:30 am this morning. The group will go to Beiping for four days to fully enjoy the Forbidden City, a purely oriental architectural masterpiece, and then return to the United States via Japan and Honolulu. It is also known that other round-the-world travelers include the German 20,000-ton giant ship "Reliable," carrying more than 400 tourists, and the French 20,000-ton giant ship "Franconia," carrying about 330 tourists, which have already departed and will soon pass through Shanghai one after another.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Will Host Farewell Banquet for Special Envoy Kong Tomorrow</h3>

<p>Mayor Wu is scheduled to host a banquet at his private residence on May Ge Road at 5:00 pm tomorrow to bid farewell to Special Envoy Kong and invite Chinese and British leaders to accompany him.</p>
<h3>Mediation of Treatment Conditions for Silk Weavers Tomorrow Morning</h3>
<p>Shengdan and Other Factories in Nanshi Have Resumed Work, While Meiya Tenth and Jinxin Remain Unresolved</p>
<p>The silk weavers' demands for improved treatment conditions have been mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau. Except for the wage portion, which will be continued to be mediated at 9:00 am tomorrow, the rest, such as working hours, have been resolved. Workers in Shengdan and other factories in Nanshi have resumed work, while workers in Meiya Tenth, Jinxin, and others have not yet resumed work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Factories in Nanshi Have Resumed Work</p>
<p>At 7:00 pm the night before, a certain silk industry association in the district suddenly advocated a general strike in the city and led the workers from the striking factories to the area of Xietu Road and Quzhenren Road in Nanshi to join the workers from the striking Jinxin and other factories in preventing workers from Shengdan, Huacheng, and Jiuhua factories from going to work. As a result, the above-mentioned factories went on strike one after another. Fortunately, the authorities sent police to suppress the strike and dispersed the workers who were preventing work, and advised the workers of the striking factories to wait quietly for the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation tomorrow. As a result, the workers of each factory agreed to resume work. Yesterday morning, although the factories in the area started work as usual, they were protected by armed police officers sent by the Police Headquarters.</p>
<p>Meiya and Jinxin Have Not Yet Resumed Work</p>
<p>㊀Workers at the Tenth Meiya Factory in Baziqiao, Zhabei, went on strike again. After the Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to persuade them without success, the striking workers insisted on demanding the release of one of the arrested workers. Because the worker had been handed over to the local court by the Police Headquarters, the workers continued to strike. ㊁After the workers of the Jinxin Silk Factory in Longrenli, Pingliang Road, Pudong, went on strike on the 16th, the Social Affairs Bureau ordered the workers to resume work by a certain date. The workers had obeyed the order and returned to work in the factory. Because the factory announced the dismissal of ten worker representatives, including Lou Zongfang and He Yao, the workers were unwilling to resume work and were still on strike.</p>
<h3>Fish Market Plans to Organize Credit Cooperative for Fishmongers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce borrowed 70,000 yuan from the Fisheries Syndicate Preparatory Office to adjust the funds of brokers and lent it to various fishermen. Now it has reached maturity and is being returned one after another, so the results are very good. Since the official establishment of the syndicate, various loan regulations have been announced, stipulating that in addition to mortgage loans for each fishing vessel, loans for each fisherman will be handled by the cooperative. In recent days, many people have applied for loans. The board of directors of the fish market also plans to organize a credit cooperative for fishmongers, which has been approved by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the syndicate is requested to plan and implement it.</p>

<h3>Pudong Electric Company Held Shareholders' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reports on Power Grid and Power Plant Plans, Election of Directors and Supervisors Announced</p>
<p>The Pudong Electric Company held its 19th annual shareholders' meeting at the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association at 2:00 pm yesterday afternoon. More than 440 shareholders attended, with a total of 15,848 shares represented. Mr. Zhao Jinxiang was elected as the temporary chairman. Then, Mr. Tong Shiheng, director and general manager, stood up to report, stating that the total amount of electricity sold last year reached more than 15.36 million degrees, an increase of about 4 million degrees compared with the previous year. Among them, electricity alone accounted for more than 11.23 million degrees, an increase of more than 3.35 million degrees compared with the previous year. It can be seen that the electricity business is developing very rapidly. The current maximum load has reached 4,000 kilowatts, and the annual cost of purchasing electricity is 300,000 to 400,000 yuan. If a new plant is not built, it will be a long-term game for others, which is not a permanent and fundamental plan. Over the past year, I have been working diligently, and I can report to the shareholders on two main points. First, the power grid plan has gradually succeeded. Our company has expanded its area and erected poles and lines in the counties of Nanhui and Chuansha. By the spring of last year, it had been largely completed. After March, it proceeded to Fengxian, and its line started from Zhanggang Town, passed Nanduqiao Xidukou, and reached Xiaotang Town on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Now it has crossed Nanqiao and connected to Zhuangxing. In addition to the Nanqiao Liheng Power Plant ordering electricity from our company, the entire Fengxian County has been fully expanded into our company's business area. Electricity can be supplied to Fengxian Old City soon. In the future, it is planned to extend westward to Yexie, Zhangze, and Liugang, so that the people in the upper and lower reaches of the southeast of the Huangpu River can enjoy the light and power of our company. In the sense of the name, it is fulfilling its duties. Second, the power plant plan has also been gradually realized recently. Our company decided on the power generation policy in June of the year before last. After the approval of the competent authority, it purchased more than 70 mu of land along the Huangpu River in Wangjiadu, Shanghai County, for the construction of a new plant, and hired experts to draw up specifications and inquire about machine prices from various companies. It has now been decided to order two 5,000-kilowatt, 6,900-volt, 50-cycle high-voltage and high-temperature steam turbine generators from the German AEG factory, and two high-pressure and high-temperature Wan-tube boilers with an evaporation capacity of 25 tons per hour from the British Babcock factory, totaling about 45,000 pounds. The Construction Committee has issued a work permit, allowing the signing of a contract for implementation. Other scattered parts, such as distribution boards, transformers, cranes, and cables, are being ordered one after another, costing about 10,000 pounds, to be paid in installments, which is still affordable. The plant construction project will also be planned. Around the autumn of next year, this 10,000-kilowatt new power plant will be successfully completed. Other engineering business and economic conditions are detailed in the business report. Please review and advise the shareholders, etc. Then, Mr. Jia Jiying, supervisor, reported the income and expenditure accounts, saying that the total profit was more than 200,700 yuan after offsetting income and expenditure last year.

<h3>Ministry of Industry and Commerce Sends Warships to Protect Fishermen During Spring Fishing Season</h3>
<p>Requests Coastal Provinces, Cities, and Counties to Assist. Since its establishment, the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has been seeking ways to assist the fishing industry, making its production more scientific and consumption more rational, in order to develop China's fishing economy and improve the lives of fish merchants and fishermen. At the same time, given that China's coastal provinces have vast fishing areas and fishermen are sticking to old methods, most of the fishing methods are outdated, so it has been seeking ways to guide them to improve and ordered the fish market to handle fishing loans to carry out relief. Recently, with the arrival of the spring fishing season, it is feared that the sea is unsafe and fishermen will be harassed. If strict protection is not provided, the losses will be huge. Therefore, in addition to sending the four fishing protection vessels Haiou, Haihong, Biaohai, and Haiying to patrol the waters of Wenzhou, Sheshan, and Daishan in Zhejiang Province, it has also requested coastal provincial and municipal governments to instruct county governments, public security bureaus, and provincial and municipal water police teams to assist, so as to be thorough.</p>

<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (17)</h3>
<p>Question: ㊀I am a worker in the laboring class. After paying for living expenses, I occasionally have a surplus of two jiao (20 cents) per day. I always want to save this money in the hope of accumulating it into a fortune. Unfortunately, all deposits require more than one yuan. Amounts less than one yuan cannot be opened. I don't know if the postal savings can accommodate amounts less than one yuan. ㊁I work in an organization in the Shanghai International Settlement, but I live in Xujiahui, Shanghai. I feel very uneasy carrying my monthly salary home. I wanted to deposit the money in a post office in the International Settlement after receiving my salary, but it would be inconvenient to withdraw it from that post office every time I need it. I now plan to deposit the money in the Nanjing Road Post Office in the International Settlement and withdraw it at the Xujiahui Post Office. I don't know if the post office has this method.</p>
<p>Answer: Postal savings accounts also require one yuan to open an account. However, there is another method for small deposits of less than one yuan: purchasing postal savings stamps. These stamps are available in two denominations: five fen (5 cents) and one jiao (10 cents). All post offices that handle savings sell them. Savers can purchase them at will. When purchasing, they can also obtain a card from the post office to paste the savings stamps. Paste the stamps into the printed spaces on the paper. When it is full of one yuan, take it to the post office and follow the prescribed procedures to open a postal savings account and exchange it for a savings book. Afterwards, you can continue to purchase and paste savings stamps. Each time you paste enough one yuan, you can hand it over to the post office to deposit it into the book. The number of deposits per person per month is limited to eight yuan, that is, eight cards pasted with savings stamps.</p>
<p>At present, postal administrations, first-class post offices, and the Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hankou Postal Savings and Remittance Bureaus are selling a kind of savings stamp tube, which is also specially used for storing small amounts of money. Each one, including the key, sells for one yuan in national currency. If savers find the procedure of purchasing and pasting savings stamps a bit cumbersome, they can use this savings stamp tube to accumulate savings. ㊀Each post office that handles postal savings in commercial ports originally had a unified deposit and withdrawal method, that is, the money deposited in Post Office A in the same place can be withdrawn in Post Office B, and the money deposited in Post Office B can also be withdrawn in Post Office A. Your money can be used with the unified deposit and withdrawal method. Not only can it be withdrawn at the Xujiahui Post Office, but it can also be deposited and withdrawn at any other post office in Shanghai. The procedure for opening a unified deposit and withdrawal savings account is the same as opening an ordinary savings account, except that the seal in the "signature certificate" column of the savings book is the same as the seal on the "account opening application form." However, if you withdraw money from a post office other than the account opening post office in the future, the amount withdrawn per month is limited to fifty yuan. If it exceeds fifty yuan, you must first notify the post office (referring to the post office you plan to withdraw money from) of the amount to be withdrawn and the savings book number. You can only withdraw money after the post office contacts its administration.</p>

<h3>Modern Politics and China (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Third, today, everyone can naturally see that the political systems of countries that have recently recovered from failure, poverty, and weakness have almost all been successful in establishing a national political belief, a political leadership, and a political goal. This shows that no recently revived country has failed to fully implement a doctrine, obey a leader, follow a national policy, and achieve its great cause of revival. Then, why do we Chinese with awareness still hesitate and look around today instead of immediately catching up and embarking on this road to success, and instead come up with various tricks and shout the slogan of cooperation between various parties and factions? In short, if everyone follows a doctrine, obeys a leader, and follows a national policy, there is no reason why they cannot cooperate. On the contrary, if everyone cannot follow a doctrine, obey a leader, and follow a national policy, how can they find a way to cooperate? Even if they can cooperate temporarily on the surface, what good results will there be? In the process of its more than 50 years of struggle, the Chinese Kuomintang has always tried its best to accommodate people from any revolutionary faction in the country. Everyone has now realized how urgent the needs of the country and the nation are. Why not engage in the struggle for the revival of the country and the nation under a belief, a leadership, and a goal? If we do not do this, but only fantasize about borrowing the beautiful name of cooperation in the hope of selling its good plan of deceiving others and deceiving ourselves, then not only the Chinese Kuomintang, which has more than 50 years of struggle experience, will not be deceived by this kind of deception that everyone knows, but also the revolutionary Chinese people will not want our revolutionary Chinese Kuomintang to accept this kind of deception. This can be asserted. We recognize the trend of modern politics, and we are even more convinced that Sun Yat-sen's principle of ruling the country by the party is the great truth of ruling the country by doctrine. We must use party rule as a cradle to cultivate the foundation of our Chinese politics. Only in this way can our country and nation be revived and saved. Comrades, here is the cause of our country and nation, and here is also our own cause. It is time, let us all work together! Let everyone come and fight! (End)</p>

<h3>Steel Bar Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Lin Baoting Sues Jin Cheng Bank, Complex Content Awaits Witnesses</p>
<p>Lin Baoting, the protagonist of Shiyu Hardware Store, was previously recommended by his brother Lin Jinting, the deputy manager of a money shop, to serve as a rent collector in the rental department of the British-owned Tailey Company. He served until May of last year, when the company discovered that he had embezzled several thousand gold in rent collected, so he was dismissed and the guarantor Lin Jinting was ordered to compensate for the private misappropriation. Shi Ting had a steel bill of lading, which he placed in his Shiyu store, while the 18 pieces of steel were stored in</p>
<p>Jin Cheng Bank's</p>
<p>warehouse. On December 15th of last year, Shi Ting suddenly sent a letter to Jin Cheng Bank, saying that the steel bill of lading had been lost, and should be voided if found again. The bank, because it had already been informed by Lin Jinting that he held the bill and claimed that the steel belonged to him, immediately replied to Shi Ting and informed him that the goods were stored with the agreement to be picked up with the bill of lading. If he wanted to report the loss, he had to find a written</p>
<p>responsible guarantee</p>
<p>from the store, otherwise, for the sake of the warehouse, the bill holder would have the right to pick up the goods. Afterwards, Shi Ting's store guarantee letters were not suitable for handling and were delayed. Although the deadline was exceeded, it was still not settled. The stored steel was not owned by him. Shi Ting then hired lawyer Xuan Zhendong to file a lawsuit against Jin Cheng Bank and the bank's president, Wu Yunzhai, in the First Special District Local Court, demanding the return of</p>
<p>deposited goods.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xu Fuji summoned the trial. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Xuan in court, stating the intent of the lawsuit and submitting letters of communication with Jin Cheng. The defendant was represented by lawyer E Sen to defend the case, saying that because the plaintiff had not completed the guarantee for a long time, the defendant could only be taken away by Lin Jinting. Now that Jinting has arrived in court, everything can be proved. Lin Jinting testified that Shi Ting is my brother, because he</p>
<p>used up Tailey's</p>
<p>7,000 yuan. Tailey ordered me to compensate because I was the guarantor. The bill of lading was given to me by Shi Ting himself last year to compensate for the loss of the replacement money, and it is still in my possession, and so on. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately denied that the bill was given by the plaintiff. The court then asked how the bill was lost, and the plaintiff's lawyer said that regarding this level,</p>
<p>it is really difficult to say,</p>
<p>but in any case, it was not given by the plaintiff. So lawyer E requested to summon the Tailey Company so that it could prove that Lin Shi Ting had embezzled a large amount of rent from the bank, and Lin Jinting is currently paying in installments. Judge Xu also believed that the plaintiff in this case was even more necessary to come to court in person to be interrogated, so he ordered the date to be changed to the afternoon of April 7th, and the plaintiff and witnesses would be summoned again for further questioning.</p>
<h3>On Soaring Prices (I)</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>The Shanghai wholesale price index indicates a return to the price levels of the early economic downturn (September of the 20th year of the Republic [1931]).</p>
<p>Newspapers are filled with advertisements for price increases across various commodities. Simultaneously, there is an abundance of news reports about labor disputes arising from demands for improved treatment.</p>
<p>From a practical perspective, three copper coins can no longer buy a large pancake that satisfies my hunger as it once did. A one-yuan banknote does not seem to stretch as far as it used to.</p>
<p>The table below compiles just the price increases advertised by various industries in February and March of this year, totaling fifty-three instances. In reality, all kinds of commodities are increasing in price. For major market items, the price increases are not always advertised. What is listed here represents only a small fraction of all industries, yet the scale is already considerable.</p>
<p>Looking at the reasons for the price increases, out of the fifty-three instances, only the British-owned Shanghai Waterworks Company raised its contract water discount from 25% to 20% due to increased expenses from the lower exchange rate of 1936. The rest are all due to the "soaring," "continuously rising," or "sharply increasing" cost of raw materials! In addition, a small number raised prices due to "heavy taxes" and "increased consolidated taxes."</p>
<p>To what extent have raw material prices soared? Just looking at the Shanghai wholesale price index categorized by the degree of processing, compared to before the implementation of legal tender (October of the 24th year of the Republic [1935]), the increase is indeed substantial. In October of the 24th year of the Republic, the total raw material index was 80.0. Now (February of the 26th year of the Republic [1937]), it has reached 114.9, an increase of 26.9%. The manufactured goods index has also risen from 97.5 to 127.3, an increase of almost 30%. The increase in the price of manufactured goods often exceeds the increase in raw materials (this is generally speaking) because increased prices also raise their expenses. In the fifty-three price increase cases, some have already raised prices for the second time. Some have changed from fixed prices to negotiated prices. Some, while not explicitly stating a price increase, attribute the higher prices to revised price lists. Others, like the soy sauce industry, have switched from accepting checks to requiring cash payments. In addition, many have increased prices by 50%, some by 10%, and most by 20%. See the table below:</p>
<p>Looking at these soaring raw materials, are they mostly foreign goods or domestic goods? Needless to say, more than two-thirds of the fifty-three cases are related to foreign goods.</p>
<p>Changes in currency value affect prices, and changes in prices naturally affect life. Not to mention the Shanghai cost of living index, which has clearly increased by more than 3% since the beginning of this year compared to last year. Looking at the successive waves of labor unrest in recent months, the textile, dyeing, silk weaving, knitting, reeling, tram, automobile, shipbuilding, and shipping industries, and even the timber, candle, and antique industries, have experienced disputes over demands for improved treatment. For example, the silk weaving industry, bringing together workers from ninety-eight factories, organized a committee to demand improved treatment and presented joint demands. In addition, there are countless other labor disputes scattered in newspapers or unreported. This is a real problem. Even if workers' wishes are granted and wages are increased, if the price increases are endless, it is doubtful whether the increased wages can solve their living difficulties. Moreover, wages and prices are mutually cause and effect. Increased wages increase costs, making further price increases unavoidable. If this cycle continues, it may be inevitable. But if prices rise and no appropriate and reasonable measures are taken, such a day will eventually come.</p>
<p>Not only are the prices of raw materials and manufactured goods soaring, but the activity in the official bond market is unprecedented since the issuance of consolidated public bonds. Public bonds can be considered wholesale currency, while banknotes are retail currency. Whether the recent surge is due to the high cost of all goods is unknown, but this possibility cannot be dismissed. Even though the legal tender has been extremely stable since its implementation, rumors continue to circulate in the market. While these rumors are typically spread by speculators and are not to be trusted, groundless rumors can create anxiety and destabilize prices, which is not the intention of promoting legal tender!</p>
<p>Therefore, regarding the future of prices, it is believed that:</p>
<p>㊀ Whether price increases driven by stimulation are truly beneficial to people's livelihoods and industries is something that deserves the most careful study.</p>
<p>㊁ The severity of labor unrest (such as the shooting and mutual injuries of workers at the Xin Yu No. 2 factory and the assault on a police chief by workers at the American Asia No. 10 factory) underscores the need for careful handling of price fluctuations to avoid triggering further labor unrest due to livelihood issues.</p>
<p>㊂ It has been a year and a half since the implementation of legal tender. If the financial situation achieves a balance of payments, then all unfounded rumors will naturally be dispelled.</p>
<p>㊃ The early establishment of the Central Reserve Bank, the complete centralization of legal tender issuance, and the consolidation of its credit foundation will allow prices to become more stable.</p>
<p>㊄ Increasing consolidated taxes and implementing income taxes both have the potential to raise prices. Under the current circumstances of industry and commerce, the method and amount of tax increases must be carefully considered.</p>
<p>㊅ Smuggling is becoming more rampant. If prices become more expensive, profits will increase, and the trend of smuggling may intensify.</p>
<h3>On Soaring Prices (II)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Bodi</p>
<p>㊀ Price Increases Are Almost the Highest in the World</p>
<p>In an era of sound currency, currency contraction leads to lower prices. The result of lower prices is reduced profits for businesses, increased unemployment for workers, and rampant deficits in national finances. Thus, sound currency is destroyed by the overall economic recession, replaced by a policy of currency inflation. (Note 2) Under a policy of currency inflation, the first step is increased issuance of public bonds, the second step is credit expansion, and the third step may be genuine currency inflation. Regardless of whether the policy of currency inflation goes through all three steps, the fact that prices are stimulated by this policy and gradually tend to rise is inevitable. Naturally, the rate of price increases will be faster in the second and third steps.</p>
<p>The beginning of the policy of currency inflation in recent years started with Britain's abandonment of the gold standard in September 1931. Later, countries such as Japan and the United States followed suit. Our country also abandoned the silver standard, while countries such as Germany and Italy implemented strict exchange controls. Until finally, France, Switzerland, and others abandoned the gold standard, so that no country in the world did not aim to lower exchange rates and became infected with the color of currency inflation.</p>
<p>Countries that have adopted a policy of currency inflation have lowered exchange rates externally and correspondingly raised prices internally. Let us observe the prices of major countries in recent years as follows: (Take 1929 as 100)</p>
<p>Total Index for the 24th Year of the Republic [1935]</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that Shanghai prices in January rose by 27.5% compared to October of the previous year; Guangzhou prices in December of last year rose by 26.71% compared to the previous year's total index; Hankou prices in December of last year rose by 16.2% compared to the previous year's total index; Nanjing prices in December of last year rose by 2.2% compared to the previous year's total index; North China prices in January of this year rose by 30.82% compared to the previous year's total index. Averaging these percentages of price increases, we can say that prices in various places have recently risen by about 22.5%. This exceeds the peak of price increases in Japan (Note 2) and is virtually the highest in the world!</p>
<p>㊁ The Friction Between Prices and Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The goal of currency inflation policies in various countries today is, on the one hand, to raise prices to stimulate industry and restore the economy; on the other hand, it is to suppress exchange rates to promote exports and inhibit imports, indirectly also helping industry to restore the economy. However, if exchange rates fall and prices rise at the same rate, the benefit of exchange rate dumping will be lost, and trade will inevitably tend to become unfavorable. Therefore, to ensure smooth trade, the rate of decrease in exchange rates must be greater than the rate of increase in prices. Of course, if these two rates differ too much, leading to a situation of "hunger exports" (Hudger export), that is also not good.</p>
<p>Of the countries listed above, except for France, prices have all tended to rise since 1931. Only Germany began to tend to rise in 1934. As for France, prices only began to tend to rise after abandoning the gold standard in September 1936. By now, rising prices have become a consistent trend in all countries. In particular, Japan's price increases are even more severe due to large budgets, virtually creating a problem for the fiscal authorities.</p>
<p>As for our China, since the implementation of the legal tender policy on November 4, 1935, domestic prices have also risen along with the global trend of high prices. A table is listed below to illustrate this: (Take 1926 as 100)</p>
<p>However, since the implementation of the new currency policy, our country's foreign exchange has been almost pegged at an exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half pence. This one shilling and two and a half pence is lower than the exchange rate of one shilling and four and three-quarter pence in October 1935 (Note 3) by 13.4% (rno086.6=13.4). However, the rate of decrease in exchange rates is clearly much smaller than the rate of increase in prices. Here, we cannot say that the exchange rate is not low enough; we can only say that prices have risen too high. Because China is a raw material country, too low of an exchange rate means that too many raw materials are exported, which is ultimately not beneficial to the national economy. At the same time, China is a debtor country, and as long as debt repudiation is not implemented, too low of an exchange rate is definitely not in the interest of public finance. Therefore, pegging the exchange rate at one shilling and two and a half pence seems justifiable.</p>
<p>But conversely, prices that are too high clearly nullify the function of exchange rate devaluation, making exports difficult and imports easy, effectively worsening trade. On the surface, our country's foreign trade decreased last year, but if smuggled imports are added, imports may have actually increased. Also, while exports appear to have increased on the surface, this may be due to the increased demand for raw materials from foreign countries during this extraordinary period!</p>
<p>㊂ The Disparity Between Prices and Wages</p>
<p>While soaring prices do not help promote trade, on the other hand, they harm the lives of ordinary people. Because the price index has risen, the cost of living index will inevitably increase accordingly. Let us look at the cost of living index in Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping: (Take 1926 as 100)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>More on "Smuggling"</h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>Regarding the smuggling by shameless Japanese and Korean rogues, I believe that besides actively arming our anti-smuggling personnel and implementing armed anti-smuggling, there is really no better second option for us. Of course, we love peace and sincerely hope to strengthen diplomatic relations, but until the "friendly nation" voluntarily eradicates the illegal organizations of their rogues, we must arm ourselves to protect our interests in order to maintain the integrity of our sovereignty. This is not hindering diplomatic relations, and in Chinese territory, the nationals of "friendly nations" should also be subject to our laws. -- Although in China, due to the constraints of various unequal treaties, even this most basic principle that nationals of friendly nations should be subject to the laws of their place of residence has not been achieved.</p>
<p>However, now, after the Shanghai Maru incident of violent assault on customs officials, smuggling has not subsided, and the attitude of Japanese and Korean rogues is becoming even more arrogant. Even customs officials are constantly under threat when performing their duties. And for us, after anti-smuggling personnel issued a declaration "hoping that the government will arm us" and "hoping that people from all walks of life across the country will provide enthusiastic support for our wishes and demands," they are now being "investigated for identifying the leading figures." When anti-smuggling personnel held a meeting in the "club" to discuss countermeasures, they were also being monitored, with the justification that "the Customs Staff Club is a place for customs staff to entertain in their leisure time," so "meetings to discuss non-entertainment matters are not allowed." And "regarding anti-smuggling issues, they must obey the commands of their superiors and must not take action on their own without the commands of their superiors, leading to various disputes."</p>
<p>"Obeying the commands of superiors" is originally necessary. Taking the Shanghai Maru incident when Mr. Kodama returned to his country as evidence, the so-called "proper anti-smuggling measures" determined by the customs authorities also seem to have achieved practical results, "transferring all the smuggled goods to customs launches and sending them to customs for confiscation." But it is noteworthy that "when the customs went to search and seize the smuggled goods, the smuggling rogues initially planned to use violence to seize them, but Mr. Kodama and others were boarding the ship to return to their country that morning, fearing it would be too embarrassing." If it were not for "Mr. Kodama and others boarding the ship to return to their country," would these seized copper coins not have been snatched away? --- "If a fundamental solution cannot be found to eliminate this type of smuggling incident, future disputes are certain to arise." This conclusion is undoubtedly very correct and reliable.</p>
<p>Some people regard this "exceptional" incident as "showing that the rogues still have a sense of shame" and therefore take it as a consolation. In my humble opinion, this "consolation" is bound to be disappointed. Smuggling is now organized, and if the Japanese consulate police had not stopped them that day, they would probably have still tried to snatch the goods. We have seen this happen many times in the past, and Mr. Kodama and others only had this one opportunity. Unless there is a very good overall solution to Sino-Japanese relations, is such a "consolation" reliable? I think, in the near future, facts will prove this to us.</p>
<p>As for the "proper measures" of the customs authorities, we naturally hope that they will continue to be effective, but after the customs officials are beaten, do not continue to "travel the paperwork," allowing the customs officials to lie in the hospital and the copper coins to be snatched away and melted into bullet casings without effective measures being taken. Furthermore, do not adopt a passive attitude of appeasement, turning a blind eye and allowing anti-smuggling personnel to be under threat while you remain high above without "commanding."</p>
<h3>Candlestick</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Ren</p>
<p>A bronze candlestick sits on my desk. The wax candle is surrounded by countless traces of rodent gnawing. Its once bright red surface has turned greyish-black. Yet, it can still proudly stand on my desk, giving me light. This is a rare gift.</p>
<p>I look at the electric light hanging in the room. It is so quiet, as if it does not know that its owner cannot afford the electricity bill and no longer relies on it. The candlestick also rejoices in its newfound favor. An arc of solidified wax forms on the wick, and the flame flickers, illuminating my bookshelf, my bed, and the portrait of my father on the wall… Perhaps he feels particularly close, because it is my father's legacy.</p>
<p>My father spent his life's energy almost entirely under the small light of the candlestick. When he was young, he studied by the candlestick, often until the pale dawn light shone through the window. But his efforts did not meet the expectations of him and his grandparents. After becoming a Xiucai (passed the county level exam), he could never climb another rung, even though he spent more and more time by the candlestick and worked harder. So he gave up his books and angrily turned to business. But the bronze candlestick did not grow distant because of his career change. On the contrary, they became even closer. After our whole family was asleep, my father would lock himself in his study. Just like when he was studying, he would calculate the profits and losses of his business, the abacus beads clattering.</p>
<p>He grew white hair by the candlestick. His energy, like a wax candle, reached the point where the light was exhausted and the oil ran dry. He passed away without saying a word of what he wanted to say to his lifelong companion.</p>
<p>However, once a year, the candlestick saw my father smile. On the night of the Winter Solstice feast, my father always came back from the store in the middle of the night. But that day was the happiest day for the whole family. Everyone waited with rumbling stomachs. The candlestick was replaced with the heavenly candle left over from the Mid-Autumn Festival, and a gauze lantern was lit in the hall, a rare night of light for our family. My mother wore an apron around her chest and cooked in the kitchen, also busy with the candles in the ancestral hall. She often took the time to go back and forth to see if the burning paper money had completely extinguished. She cooked the dishes that my father particularly liked with such care. Until the sound of knocking on the door and hearing my father's voice, everyone rushed to the door. Some took the lanterns, some grabbed umbrellas, and my mother always took the burden off my father's back. The burden was so heavy. My father's and mother's smiles reflected each other in the faint light, and the children cheered and rushed to the back hall.</p>
<p>My father kowtowed in the ancestral hall, silently praying for longevity, so solemn, so devout. Was he telling his grandparents that he had not achieved any official position? Until he died, he never said what he hoped for, because he urged us to study with exceptional strictness. "You must study!" He only had this one sentence. Back in the hall, the dishes were full on the table. A master chair was placed in the center, and my father's favorite dishes were placed in front of him. Then he laughed loudly—that rare laughter echoed in the hall for a while. He assigned seats for us one by one, and then sat in the master chair, snatched the wine pot from my mother's hand, and poured half a cup for my mother, as if treating a guest who had come from afar, saying:</p>
<p>"You've worked hard, drink a cup to warm your stomach."</p>
<p>My mother smiled, "It's cold outside, you drink more."</p>
<p>"It hasn't snowed yet, the cold days are ahead." My father always smiled, divided the dishes in front of him among us, and happily drank wine.</p>
<p>The candlestick accompanied my father on his left. The light illuminated my father's slightly drunk smile, gradually flowing full of candle oil and going out.</p>
<p>After moving to Shanghai, my father still liked to use candles. He said that he couldn't concentrate when working under the electric light. When eating the Winter Solstice feast, he also never forgot to put the bronze candlestick on the table, and also put the heavenly candle left over from the Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>Last year, the master chair was empty at the Winter Solstice feast table, and there was an extra cup for my father during the sacrifice. My mother didn't eat that day, and no one thought about the bronze candlestick.</p>
<p>Now, an arc of solidified wax forms on its wick, which is exactly the heavenly candle left over from the Mid-Autumn Festival. So I gently moved it to my father's portrait, let its flickering flame accompany my father's loneliness. Only it can know what my father wanted to say.</p>
<h3>The Spring of Huanglongxian</h3>
<p>— Zhang Haopu</p>
<p>—— One of the Miscellanies of Qidong Mountain Wilderness</p>
<p>In the days leading up to my release from prison, I had made up my mind that as soon as I regained my freedom, I would return to "Vladivostok." Who would have thought that the world outside the prison was completely different from what I imagined? It had changed, changed so much that it surprised me. Not only was my dream of going to "Vladivostok" shattered, but even going to "Harbin" was not easy. So, I had no choice but to take the twenty yuan "old man's ticket" (Korean Bank notes) that the police were supposed to give me—the reward I deserved for five years of hard labor in prison—and leave "Dalian," leaving the slave's prison in the colony, and return to the Qidong Mountain Wilderness where I had lived seven years ago.</p>
<p>I once again set foot on the old, familiar sheep trail. Fatigue bound my legs, and in the gentle and warm sunlight, I sat on the right bank, dozing off. From the distant wheat fields, pine forests, streams, and the nearby valleys, the breath of spring constantly permeated. I was intoxicated, and fell asleep completely. Only when the twilight sieved golden light over me did I wake up. Hurriedly continuing my journey, by the time the lamps were lit, I had already found myself at the home of the hunter Chen Laotian.</p>
<p>My sudden return surprised and delighted the old hunter. After I clearly told him about my experiences over the past seven years, he was so happy that he shed tears. He treated me with such consideration, as if I were his own children. So, I stayed by his side, following him up the mountains to hunt, and down to the fields to farm. At night, in the thatched cottage, sitting under the oil lamp, I listened to him endlessly recounting his past and the history of "Huanglongxian."</p>
<p>The farmers and hunters of "Huanglongxian" are all honest and simple. They live peacefully, without hatred, jealousy, or strife and plunder. They don't treat me as an outsider; on the contrary, they are kind and close to me, so my life is integrated with theirs.</p>
<p>Spring is a joyous season, and both farmers and hunters begin their work. Only those sentimental girls and passionate youths are annoyed and curse spring. Spring ignites their flames of love, burning inextinguishably! Whether the girls are washing clothes by the river, or cutting turnips in the vegetable garden, young lads are always chasing after them. Sometimes, in the grasslands and orchards, one can constantly see young men and women talking and laughing intimately. Customs give them freedom, and no one can interfere or obstruct them. Spring sows the seeds of love, which quickly sprout in the "Huanglongxian" area. Free mountains and wilderness! People live without restrictions, they love peace, but they will not be bullied by others!</p>
<p>The snow on the mountains has long melted with the scorching sunlight. The pine forest rustles in the spring breeze, occasionally emitting whistles. The lumberjacks, tired and uneasy, grab their axes, and it takes a long time to chop down a tree. After lunch, as usual, I go up the mountain alone, napping on a large stone bank, or else chatting with the lumberjacks. Once the sun turns to the west, I shoulder my gun to hunt rabbits and pheasants. The best to hunt during this time are pheasants, they are always in pairs and not very alert, so I hit them nine out of ten times, and mostly the females.</p>
<p>The mountains and fields are filled with pleasant atmosphere. Farmers sing mountain songs in the wheat fields, and the village girls sing too? No, not mountain songs, but love songs yearning for spring. Old hunter Chen Laotian's daughter also sings all day long, singing while grinding, singing while cooking. When her lover comes, she lets her throat rest. When her lover leaves, she sings again. Perhaps singing can dispel worries?</p>
<p>One day, I, along with the old hunter's daughter and her lover, carried hunting guns and walked along the river that surrounds the village. The clear, limpid water glistened with shimmering ripples, and flocks of ducks floated. Children rolled up their trousers and caught fish and shrimp in the water, their bodies splashed with water stains and green moss. We crossed the stone bridge and walked east towards the willows. The bare willow branches had already sprouted tender green buds. Sparrows leaped on the grass, looking for caterpillars that had just emerged from the soil. Outside the woods was a vast, flat field, the green wheat fields and the clear, blue sky reflected each other. Flocks of geese were eating wheat seedlings in the wheat fields. We loaded our guns to shoot the geese. But geese are very alert birds that don’t even brush the grass, so they are very difficult to shoot. With great difficulty, the three of us found two "grass stalks??" to use as cover, and the three of us fired at the same time. With the sound of the guns, the flocks of geese flew up, scattering in all directions. We ran over, and did not miss, killing five pairs. Zhizi (the old hunter's daughter) laughed, she carried the dead geese, and looked at her lover and smiled. We then turned into the valley, rested for a while on the lawn by the stream, and ran to the pine forest to hunt rabbits. The cuckoo kept calling, but no one bothered it. According to the customs here, hunters cannot shoot cuckoos. It is a heavenly bird that urges farmers to cultivate, like an angel with a mission, people cannot harm it. Zhizi suddenly spotted a pair of wildcats and shot one with a single shot. She jumped up with joy. She said she hadn’t shot a wildcat in two years, and wildcat skins are very valuable. As we were walking, two young hunters walked towards us. They told us that there was a raccoon dog in a deep stone cave behind the hillside. They had been following it for three days, and several shots had missed. They wanted us to go and hunt it together. We turned over the hillside and climbed over two large stone ridges before reaching the vicinity of the stone cave. We tried various methods to get the raccoon dog to come out, but failed. Finally, we all lay on the ground, silent, and after a long time, it finally came out. The five of us fired at the same time. In the midst of the chaotic gunfire, the raccoon dog was killed by bullets.</p>
<p>When we returned in the evening, the old hunter was very satisfied. Our harvest was great. That night, the village was extremely lively, with gongs and drums, burning incense and paper, for tomorrow was the day of worshiping the Spring God.</p>
<h3>Sai Jinhua (10)</h3>
<p>— Chen Hezuo</p>
<p>The group of gentry boxers is called the Yihetuan. Their spirit has indeed established many glorious deeds. For example, boycotting foreign goods, no matter what household, if there are foreign goods, they must be quickly destroyed. Otherwise, they will be "rewarded" with wooden blocks and glass shards. People who understand and speak foreign languages ​​are regarded as "straight eyes" and "second devils," which means traitors. When caught on the altar, the elder brother burns two talismans and asks if you are a good person. If the talismans rise after burning, you are a good person; otherwise, you will be chopped to death immediately. Of course, there are also those who died unjustly; but at that time, there were indeed many people who understood and spoke foreign languages ​​who became traitors selling out the nation.</p>
