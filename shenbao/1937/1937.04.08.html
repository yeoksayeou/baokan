<p>時評</p>
<h3>從沈鈞儒等案說到統一救國</h3>
<p>— 閑</p>
<p>沈鈞儒等以在上海組織救國會而遭逮捕覊押。歷時四月餘。今乃以提起公訴聞矣。法治國家。人民犯罪。應受法律之制裁。而在法庭未定讞之前。輿論機關對於案情曲直。更不宜任意批評。以影嚮法庭之判詞。吾人茲所欲論者。非沈鈞儒等案之本身。而為本案之起源。共在政治與社會上所發生之影饗。與其補救之方針。蓋此則直接間接有關我國家我政府自力更生統一禦侮之大計。而非可苟安緘默者也。</p>
<p>自沈案發生以後微聞當國要人。在野名流為沈等奔走緩頰者。頗不乏人。而在海外則如美國學者名流杜威教授等。以及國際和平會議。亦均電請我國政府從寬釋放至在我國當局。對於政治案件。向多採取簡易程序。由軍事機關審理。獨於本案則由上海公安局移交蘇州高等法院。依法辦理。且檢察官偵査手續一再展延。歷四閱月之久。始乃决定提起公訴。我政府與司法當局之重視本案。絕不苟且從事。亦於此可見一斑。此何也本案嫌疑被告沈鈞儒·王造时·李公樸·沙千里·章乃器·鄒韜奮·史良·陶行知等。多為在社會上頗負聲望之士。而又以從事救國運動干犯法紀自與尋常公法犯不同本案為中外朝野人士所共同關切。殆以是歟。</p>
<p>政治犯罪事件。為國家不幸之事。而在社會上有相當地位之知識分子。亦因政治而犯罪。尤為大不幸之事。何以故。則以政府與人民之間。缺乏互信。可由是以覘之焉。査本案檢察官所控訴之犯罪事實。如號召各當各派抗敵禦侮也。如倡導人民救國陣綫也。如組織全國救國會也凡此大抵均係政治意見上與國家法令互相牴觸。此等糾紛在現代國家。本可藉報紙及議會之論戰加以解决。而在吾國。則因環境之牽制。必訴諸法律制裁而後可。則就國家統一與人才集中而論。誠屬至可扼腕者也。</p>
<p>今沈案旣已由司法機關正式起訴。則將來自可由法庭秉公審制予以解决而無所用其𣏌憂。吾人之所盧者。則如何以使類似沈案不幸事件不再發生。如何以使負有社會聲望之智識分子在政府領導之下共同努力。如何以使民衆禦侮組織不至與法令牴觸。如何以使三中全會所決定團結民衆之辦法。以及蔣委員長談話所指示集中人才釋放政治犯之原則。均得以具體實現此則决非僅賴法律制裁所能補救。而必有待於政治方面輿論方面之努力而後可也。</p>
<p>政府方面之努力者何。三中全會旣揭和平統一團結禦侮之旨。則我政府當局。應以寬大為懷。在黨政機關正確之指導下。容許人民禦侮救亡之組織自由。當局本身尤應率先倡導民衆救亡之組織與訓練。對於救國會。當加以指示誘導。使其不至干犯法紀。庶幾統一可期。而衆議自息。所謂輿論方面之努力者何。曩昔政府保障國權之决心未為一般民衆所瞭解。馴至政府與民衆間互相隔阂。一部分急進之士迫於國破家亡之危禍。遂乃不顧一切而有軌外之舉動。彼輩雖自稱並不反對政府然未得黨政當局許可而組織團體。在客觀上造成與政府對立之事實。轉失其團結禦侮之初衷。繼今以後。對於民衆當盡量傳達政府之意志。務令全國上下。一德一心以共同排除當前之國難。此為輿論界應有之天責。願與我同業共相策勵焉。</p>
<p>總之。沈案結果如何可置不論。然我當局。常視此為不幸之事。不可存絲亳驕矜之心。我民衆亦當體念政府為國之忠誠。而勿加以猜疑庶幾以沈案為般鑒共同求互信互諒之實現統一救國之旨。其在斯乎。</p>
<h3>日本總選戰聲中內閣前途悲觀</h3>

<h3>日朝野討論對華問題</h3>
<p>東京商工會議得到結論　承認大陸政策　含有侵略意味</p>

<p>㊀關於調整中日關係問題、日本對華態度已有顯異之變更、然亦不能變更過甚、否則不免使中國發生認日本有錯誤之印象、故對華態度之變更、應有相當限制日本之大陸政策、有擴張領土計劃之意味乃帝國歷來一貫之政策、關於華北問題深覺痛心、日本應祛除華方之誤會者、日本僅欲將該區施以開發耳、中國估計其國力似覺有過甚之處、故在此種空氣之下、欲調整兩國關係實覺困難、日本今後最佳之政策、莫如出以監視式之靜觀改善中日關係之障礙、卽為華北問題、採用強硬政策實屬必要、㊁關於對華輿論問題、應有立卽統一之必要、㊂關於華北問題、目前殊無推進華北政策之必要、蓋徒足以益滋中國對日之疑慮耳、㊃至兩國經濟合作、若不先解决政治方面之困難、卽無法達到、惟應注意者凡在華具有勢力之國人、應與華人密切合作、政府應令橫濱正金銀行對在華國人、作實業上之經濟援助、最近英國在華中華南方面之經濟活動、甚囂塵上、日本須密切注意、</p>
<p>當時並有主張在華北組織中日公司、俾甚於政治基礎、推進日本一切計劃、然該提案遭大會否决云</p>

<h3>蘇高法院檢察官對沈鈞儒等起訴（續）</h3>
<p>（五）共產黨毛澤東答覆沈鈞儒等信函（係印刷品）內有“南京政府五月五日頒佈的憲法與國民大會組織法選舉法、我們認為是反民主的、根據這些法律組縱的國民大會、我們不能承認他有代表全國人民意的權利、”“我們認為這種國民大會的存在有害的”、“我們希望你們及全國一切救國團體派代表參加蘇維埃政府、其抨擊憲法一點、尤與被告等所稱”含有制禮作樂的憲法是多餘的等語、若合符節、矧査毛澤東信內所述、不但無自動取消蘇維埃政府之表示、且希望各團體能派代表前往參與、該偽政府、被告等以其係對於救國會所表示之響應、竟將是項反動刊物、由章乃器授與羅靑、命其擔任組織江蘇各界救國聯合會、（見羅靑歷次供述）乃猶飾稱為“並無危害民國之犯意一、又誰能信、</p>
<p>（六）被告等除堅不承認有誘動學生罷課情事外、對於組織工人罷工後援會、則並不否認並稱、“工人救國會亦加入上海各界救國聯合會之內”等語、其用救國會名義散發為上海三百五十萬市民請命傳單、亦有“這二十餘萬的工人、都可訓練為衝鋒陷陣的英雄”之語、對於智識簡單之工人、竟不惜多方煽惑以遂其不法之企圖、乃被告等猶以“意在救國、並無其他作用、”斤斤置辯、顯屬虛飾之詞、</p>
<p>（七）在鄒韜奮家搜獲共產黨刊行之鬬爭報其中雖批評“章乃器是叛國階級的史太林派”、並稱、“反對章乃器們的救國陣綫、沒有政治野心、沒有奪取政權的企圖、引入愛國一途、减少鬬爭的力量、”縱令果如所言亦不過謂伊等之主張、與極端左傾之杜洛斯基派有別、仍與三民主義不能相容、殊難以此為被告等有利之證據、</p>
<p>（八）被告等雖稱、“伊等與第三國際並無關係、”然查人民陳綫、卽係第三國際第七次代表大會所通過之口號、其關於中國成立人民陣綫議决案、內有“在中國必須把擴大蘇維埃運動、與鞏固紅軍的戰鬬力、與在全中國開展人民運動連結起來”、蘇維埃應當成為全中國人民解放鬬爭中心、又中國共產黨對於建立中國人民陣綫、內有“在救國名義下、並發動反現政府的鬬爭”、“反對現政府及國民黨、（見附卷二十六年二月四日中央日報）被告等所倡之口號、旣係本於第三國際大會所通過之議决案而來、其於各種刊物內復屢言、“討赤不易成功”、“不相信國民黨司以包辦救國、”並於團結禦侮的幾個基本條件、與最低要求第五項載有、我們贊成中國共產黨和中國紅軍這一個政策”之語、尤顯與前述第三國際議决案相一致、自無解於危害民國之罪責、</p>
<p>（九）上年十二月十二日西安事變、據張學良所提出之八項主張、內有“容納各黨各派負責救國、及立卽釋放上海被捕之愛國領袖、立卽召開救國會議”等項、被告等對此雖堅稱、“亳未與聞其事”、並謂“上年五月卅一日全國各界救國聯合會成立之時尚未聞西安有教國會”等語、然査上年五月六日、救亡情報創刊號、卽有“西安學生悲壯的救國運動”、“西安各學校均有救國會的組織”之記載、該情報第十五期對於放立西北各界救國聯合會情形、記載尤為詳悉、並稱、“全救會宣言和綱領、我們翻印了二千多分、已普遍散發等語、足見被告等所稱、“西安並無救國會二節顯係有意諉卸、又同年十一月二十二日第一十七期救亡情報載有各國各界救國聯合會致西安張學良電報、“前略、望公本立卽抗日之主張、火速堅决要求中央立卽停止南京外交談判、發動全國抗日戰爭、並電約各軍事領䄂一面對中央為一致之督促一面劉綏遠實行出兵援助、事急國危、幸卽圖之、此電拍發後、為時僅浹荀卽有西安事變發生、而張學良之通電又明明以釋放該被告等為要挾、且核其彼此所揭櫫之主張亦復完全相同、其變方互相聯絡之情形、已堪認定、雖被告原電、僅係慫恿張學良聯合各將領、督促政府對外出兵、尚不能證明西安暴動係出於被告等所策劃、而其勾結軍人、謀為軌外行動、馴至釀成鉅變、國本幾乎動搖、名為救國、政府自有整個計劃縱令被告等果具愛國熱忱、亦當於政府領導之下、竭誠獻替一致進行、以期有濟、乃竟假聯合各黨各派為名、私立救國聯合會、其所倡另建抗敵政權節、尤與張學良通電所謂改組政府之主張、適相吻合、此外又復散發種種刊物、鼓吹人民救國陣綫等謬說、淆亂聽聞、使人民與政府間、起分化之作用是其以危害民國為目的而組織團體、並宣傳與三民主義不相容之主義、更屬罪證確鑿、灼然無　、</p>
<p>（十）瞿青承認擔任組織江蘇各界救國聯合會屬實、並稱“與章乃器接洽時、沈鈞儒鄒韜奮亦一同在座”、此外復在其身畔搜獲有、㊀全國各界救國聯合會大會宣言、㊁抗日救國初步政治綱領、㊂團結禦侮的幾個基本條件與最低要求、㊃共產黨致國民黨書、㊄毛澤東油印回信、㊅江蘇各界救國聯合會籌備會木戳等件、足證其參加以危害民國為目的之團體為不虛、依法應認為共同正犯、顧留馨任頌高自認係上海職業界救國會會員、任頌高並兼任該會理事、一面復與張仲勉·陳道弘·陳卓等共五人、分持上海各界救國聯合會傳單以該救國會代表名義具呈請求回復沈鈞儒等自由、經將訪傳單暨顧留馨所持救國會刊發之國難新聞分別扣押在案、並足以證明其參與犯罪、委係出於共同之意思、自亦應以共同正犯論、</p>

<p>白伶失蹤　後、張巨川卽向徐培根提出交涉、要求賠償損害、因徐在漢口、白母因四出找尋白之蹤跡、故交涉屢次延約停頓、張巨川遂委任律師具狀特二法院民庭對徐培根與白兄李國璋提起損害賠償之訴、計分五點、要求判令被吿等</p>
<p>償違約金　五千元與恩派亞戲院、自白伶失蹤時起所受之損失、由被吿等担任訟費、第一被吿不能淸償時、由第二被吿負責赔償、並請求宣示假執行等情、案經吳孝恪推事一度開庭傳訊、論知改期各情、已誌本報茲悉此案雙方在外</p>
<p>和解不成　昨日上午、又奉開庭傳訊、雙方均由律師代到、先由原吿略陳起訴標的後、並稱恩派亞戲院之開銷、每日為九十元、依往時營業、計算一個月可盈餘三千元、以未滿期之二個月合同計算、則損失當在六千元、且訂立合同書明</p>

<p>在恩派亞　演戲每日取資四成、此乃事實、但與恩派亞所訂合同、與李無干、由河北評劇團出血、故請駁回原吿之訴、又由原吿律師補充意見、謂河北評劇團主要人在白玉霜一人、譬如梅蘭芳與現在黃金大戲院之程硯秋等生角、祇有一個、配角不在內、故白玉霜失蹤、河北評劇團、已全部瓦解云云、吳孝格推事核情、命開辯論後、宣吿終結、退庭、</p>

<h3>“安全辦法”</h3>
<p>— 蕭梅</p>
<p>自從海關緝私人員被日浪人毆打成傷之後，“如何緝私”這一問題是曾被提出來，但曾幾何時，傷者及緝私辦法的下文，又漸漸地由冷淡而銷聲匿跡了。偶爾在報紙的角落裏，或者還可以看到一些佔着絕少篇幅的一抄獲大批銅元”，“又偷運銅元出口”的新聞，算是告訴讀者走私風潮在上海，並沒有絕跡。而隱隱中，也算替海關當局說明：盡了若干責任，佔了若干“勝利”，抄獲了若干銅元。</p>
<p>從緝私人員被毆傷，浪人的氣燄不僅不見稍低，並且還變本加厲的時候，我們的講究禮讓的海關常局是發明了所謂“安全辦法”及“不得在未得上級人員指揮之前，擅自執行，釀成種種糾紛”的“服從”招牌。</p>
<p>果然“安全辦法”從今天報上的新聞看來是有了“巨大收穫”。據云：（停泊日本郵船公司碼頭之日輸摩耶丸，前日午夜時，又有浪人五十名，分穿特製之厚布馬甲，偷運銅元，直至二時左右，始行裝竣，時海關已接獲密報，但為防止意外，並未派員阻截，該浪人等，於裝竣後，卽全部離輪，僅留數人看守。及至昨晨四時，海關始派員登輪，實施緝査，當在輪上抄獲銅元十餘萬枚，（約值四百元）及偷運之馬甲九件，卽裝入麻袋，由汽車安全運入海關，全部沒收。為海關緝私人員上月二十六日以後之第二度巨大收獲。”</p>
<p>但不幸得很，從上月二十六日至現在，為期已十天了，這十天嚮難道就沒有“大批銅元偷運出口”過嗎？翻了一下舊報，見四月四日某報中便有云：</p>
<p>“二日淸晨一時，又有大批日本浪人，各持木棍鐵尺，馳至匯山碼頭，將江海關派駐該處稅驚悉行監視，並禁止華人使用匯山碼頭管理處之電話，遂將銅元自餘包，（每包約二千枚左右）指揮流氓漢奸，搬登日輪秩父丸。及搬運完竣後，恐稅驚向江海關緝私課通報，仍將派警監視，直至黎明六時，秩父丸起椗離滬，始呼嘯而散。”</p>
<p>緊接這條新聞之後的，還有紀述日輪龍田丸出口時，也有偷運銅元出口情事，末後的紀載云：“當時值守該處碼頭之海關稅警，見狀卽向華籍關員請求發令攔截，但因華籍關員不欲多事，致稅警格於海關規章，未能執行職務。”</p>
<p>上面這兩條新聞都是頗為“安全”的，前者的安全”，那應該歸功於浪人，而後者則應該歸功於我們“不欲多事”的華籍關員，然而，也正因之，中國的銅元，在托庇於“安全辦法”下，“安全”地裝上日輪，“安全”地到日本去了？</p>
<p>雖然“安全”的地方却不同，或在日輪，或到海關。而看樣子，却是日輪多於海關，或者甚至祇有日輪沒有海關的。</p>

<h3>League of Nations to Convene General Assembly in May</h3>
<p>To Discuss Egypt's Membership; Abyssinia May Not Send Representatives</p>
<p>[London] The League of Nations General Assembly is now scheduled to convene an extraordinary session in late May to approve Egypt's membership. It is reported that the Emperor of Abyssinia may not send representatives to attend because the agenda of the Assembly only involves accepting Egypt as a member. However, some sources say that this is due to the British government's persuasion. The League of Nations will address the issue of whether Abyssinian representatives should attend the Assembly during its annual General Assembly in September, which will be referred to a special committee for discussion, as was done last year. However, this does not apply if the Abyssinian Emperor decides not to send representatives in the interim. Regarding this matter, it is reported that the Emperor is consulting with legal scholars, especially Professor Sheet of the Faculty of Law at the University of Paris. In short, the issue of Abyssinian representatives attending League of Nations meetings is extremely complex. One possible solution is to gradually exclude Abyssinia from the League of Nations by seizing upon an issue at each annual General Assembly that prevents Abyssinian representatives from attending. This approach may be considered cautious. (Havas Dispatch, Central News Agency, 6th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>From the Shen Junru Case to Unified National Salvation</h3>
<p>— Leisurely</p>
<p>Shen Junru and others were arrested and detained for organizing the National Salvation Association in Shanghai. It has been over four months, and now it is reported that a public prosecution has been initiated. In a country governed by law, criminals should be punished according to the law. However, before a court verdict, the media should not arbitrarily criticize the case's merits to influence the court's judgment. What we want to discuss here is not the Shen Junru case itself, but its origin, its impact on politics and society, and its remedy. This is directly and indirectly related to our country's and our government's major plans for self-reliance, unity, and resistance to foreign aggression, and we cannot remain silent.</p>
<p>Since the Shen case occurred, we have heard that many important figures in the government and well-known personalities out of power have been working to intercede on behalf of Shen and others. Overseas, scholars and celebrities such as Professor John Dewey and the International Peace Conference have also telegraphed our government, requesting lenient release. In our country, authorities have often adopted simplified procedures for political cases, with military agencies handling the trials. However, in this case, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau transferred the case to the Suzhou High Court for legal processing. Moreover, the prosecutor's investigation procedures were repeatedly extended, lasting for over four months before deciding to initiate a public prosecution. The importance our government and judicial authorities attach to this case and their commitment to not acting carelessly are evident. Why is this? The suspected defendants in this case, Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, Tao Xingzhi, and others, are mostly people with considerable reputations in society. Moreover, because they engaged in the national salvation movement and violated the law, they are different from ordinary public law offenders. This case is of common concern to people at home and abroad. Is this the reason?</p>
<p>Political crime events are unfortunate for the country. It is even more unfortunate when intellectuals with a considerable social standing also commit crimes due to politics. Why? Because there is a lack of mutual trust between the government and the people. This can be seen from this incident. The facts of the crime alleged by the prosecutor in this case, such as calling on all parties to resist foreign aggression and defend the country, advocating a people's national salvation front, and organizing a national national salvation association, are generally political opinions that conflict with national laws. In modern countries, these disputes can be resolved through debates in newspapers and parliament. However, in our country, due to environmental constraints, legal sanctions must be resorted to. Therefore, in terms of national unity and talent concentration, it is truly regrettable.</p>
<p>Now that the Shen case has been formally prosecuted by the judicial authorities, it will be resolved by the court impartially, so there is no need to worry too much. What we are concerned about is how to prevent similar unfortunate events from happening again, how to enable intellectuals with social prestige to work together under the leadership of the government, how to prevent popular anti-aggression organizations from conflicting with the law, and how to ensure that the measures to unite the people decided by the Third Plenary Session and the principles of concentrating talent and releasing political prisoners indicated in Chairman Chiang's speech can be concretely realized. This cannot be remedied by legal sanctions alone, but requires efforts in the political and public opinion aspects.</p>
<p>What efforts should the government make? Since the Third Plenary Session revealed the purpose of peaceful unification, uniting against aggression, our government should be broad-minded. Under the correct guidance of party and government agencies, it should allow the freedom of the people's anti-aggression and national salvation organizations. The authorities themselves should take the lead in promoting popular national salvation organizations and training. For the National Salvation Association, instructions and guidance should be given to prevent it from violating the law. In this way, unification can be expected, and public opinion will subside. What efforts should the public opinion make? In the past, the government's determination to protect national rights was not understood by the general public, leading to mutual estrangement between the government and the people. A group of radicals, facing the danger of national subjugation and family destruction, disregarded everything and took actions beyond the law. Although they claimed that they did not oppose the government, the organization of groups without the permission of party and government authorities objectively created a situation of opposition to the government, which defeated their original intention of uniting against aggression. From now on, the government's will should be conveyed to the people as much as possible, so that the whole country, from top to bottom, can work together to overcome the current national crisis. This is the inherent responsibility of the public opinion, and I am willing to encourage my colleagues to work together.</p>
<p>In short, the outcome of the Shen case is irrelevant. However, our authorities should always regard this as an unfortunate event and not have any complacency. Our people should also appreciate the government's loyalty to the country and not be suspicious. It is hoped that the Shen case will be used as a mirror to jointly seek the realization of mutual trust and mutual understanding of the purpose of unifying and saving the country.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Cabinet Pessimistic Amidst Japan's General Election</h3>
<p>Researching Countermeasures to Ensure Victory; Anti-Government Atmosphere in Political Parties Intensifies</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Hayashi Cabinet, in light of the increasing anti-government atmosphere among the Seiyukai and Minseito parties and the alarming advance of the proletarian parties, is planning active countermeasures to ensure a considerable victory in the general election on the 30th of this month. Among the various countermeasures adopted by the government, the most notable are the stringent principles passed at the local governors' conference, prohibiting anti-government, anti-military, and anti-war propaganda during the election campaign. On the other hand, the cabinet is using various propaganda methods to encourage the people to elect individuals who have a correct understanding of the Japanese national polity and the extraordinary period. The cabinet will hold a three-day temporary cabinet meeting starting today to formulate specific plans that may appeal to the people, and will announce them on the 9th. Important cabinet members, such as Prime Minister Hayashi, will begin giving public speeches from the 13th. Prime Minister Hayashi will visit Prince Konoe Fumimaro, President of the House of Peers, in a private capacity on the 8th. This visit is of the same nature as the visit to Baron Hiranuma Kiichirō, President of the Privy Council, on the 6th, to exchange views on the prospects of organizing a new party. Observers here believe that since Hayashi Senjuro cannot organize a new party to join the election before the election, no matter how appealing the cabinet's policies and plans are, it will be difficult to get the constituencies to support the government, as they are at a loss as to whom to vote for. If Prime Minister Hayashi's policy is to alienate established political parties in order to form a party after the election, it will inevitably lead to various slanders and dishonorable incidents. As evidenced by repeated precedents in Japanese history, this will further lower the government's prestige. Therefore, the people's pessimism about the future of the Hayashi Cabinet increases with the progress of the election campaign. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The government's independent policy to deal with the general election, compiled by Chief Secretary Ohashi, has been completed. After being reviewed at a cabinet meeting on the afternoon of the 7th, it will be officially decided on the 9th and announced on the same day. Among the policies compiled by Ohashi are the extension of compulsory education and the electricity control plan, which were the seven major national policies decided by the Hirota Cabinet. Therefore, the Hayashi Cabinet seems to be inheriting the important policies of the previous cabinet. In addition, the iron and steel enterprise law and the fuel national policy-related law, which were not established in the last parliament, are naturally included. (Domei Dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government and Opposition Parties Discuss China Policy</h3>
<p>Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry Reaches Conclusion; Acknowledges that Continental Policy Contains Aggressive Implications</p>
<p>▲ The North China Daily News reports that Japanese government and opposition parties believe that there must be a major reason why Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has not been successful. Therefore, the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry convened an important meeting last Thursday, attended by important figures from various fields, including military, financial, political, and business circles, to solicit opinions on Japan's future policy towards China. The meeting lasted for three and a half hours. Attendees included Matsumoto, a consultant from the former Foreign Provincial Assembly; Mitsui Niijima; Dr. Oyama; former Foreign Minister Arita; Sato, from the former South Manchuria Railway Company; Shibayama, the director of the military affairs section of the military; Ariyoshi, the former Ambassador to China; Kanda, a member of parliament and former correspondent in China for the Asahi Shimbun; and Kato, the president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, among others.</p>
<p>Four issues were raised at the meeting: ㊀ How to adjust Sino-Japanese relations; ㊁ Is it necessary to unify public opinion on China; ㊂ How to resolve the North China problem; ㊃ How to realize Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.</p>
<p>Regarding the above four major issues, opinions were exchanged as much as possible, and the following conclusions were reached:</p>
<p>㊀ Regarding the issue of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, Japan's attitude towards China has undergone a significant change, but it cannot be changed too much, otherwise China may have the impression that Japan has made a mistake. Therefore, changes in attitude towards China should be appropriately limited. Japan's continental policy, which implies a plan to expand its territory, has been the Empire's consistent policy. Regarding the North China problem, we feel deeply pained. Japan should dispel China's misunderstanding. Japan only wants to develop the region. China seems to overestimate its national power, so under this atmosphere, it is difficult to adjust relations between the two countries. The best policy for Japan in the future is to take a watchful and quiet approach. The obstacle to improving Sino-Japanese relations is the North China problem, and it is necessary to adopt a tough policy. ㊁ Regarding public opinion on China, it is necessary to unify it immediately. ㊂ Regarding the North China problem, there is currently no need to promote the North China policy, as it would only increase China's suspicion of Japan. ㊃ Regarding economic cooperation between the two countries, it cannot be achieved without first resolving political difficulties. However, it should be noted that Japanese who have influence in China should cooperate closely with the Chinese. The government should order the Yokohama Specie Bank to provide financial assistance to Japanese in China for industrial projects. Recently, British economic activity in the southern part of China has been rampant, and Japan must pay close attention.</p>
<p>It was also proposed to establish a Sino-Japanese company in North China to promote all of Japan's plans on a political basis, but this proposal was rejected by the conference.</p>

Upon hearing this news, officials of the National Socialist Party here expressed surprise and said that Germany's future attitude towards the Soviet Union could be seen clearly and without any doubt from the speeches made by key figures such as Chancellor Hitler at the National Socialist Party Congress in Nuremberg last September (note: Hitler's speech contained fierce attacks on the Soviet Union). In addition, the British Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, stated that those spreading the news of a German-Soviet rapprochement intended to cause disputes among the countries of the Little Entente. The general German observer community is interested in this view. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] After the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigemitsu Mamoru, the Ambassador to Belgium, Kurusu, the Minister to Czechoslovakia, Fujii, and the Minister to Austria, Tateno, arrived here successively, a reporter from this agency asked Minister Fujii about the content of their meeting. The minister replied that his arrival in Berlin at the same time as the other diplomats was coincidental. They had played golf with employees of Mitsubishi Corporation in the city of Setteritz in eastern Germany. They had all lost. The claim that relations between the Soviet Union and Japan are strained is not accurate, because if this were true, then the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigemitsu Mamoru, would certainly not have left his post to come here. Although minor incidents often occur in areas bordering the Soviet Union, "Manchukuo," and Korea, their nature is certainly not as serious as rumored. According to reliable sources, the main goal of the talks held by the ambassadors and ministers here is to discuss Germany's position in Central Europe.

<h3>In a Future World War, North Africa Will Become a Battlefield</h3>
<p>Ludendorff Publishes Paper</p>
<p>[Berlin] General Ludendorff, a famous general of the European War, recently published an article in his magazine "Germany's Sacred Source of National Power," stating, "If a world war breaks out, North Africa will become a battlefield. Its importance cannot be taken lightly. However, the ultimate victory or defeat will still be decided on the European battlefield." General Ludendorff then outlined the situation in various countries around the world. When discussing Russia, he made only a brief conclusion, saying, "In every respect, Russia is a closed-door country." (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<h3>Japan Pays Close Attention to the Free Trade Movement</h3>
<p>German Economic Minister to Visit Brussels; Belgian Prime Minister Prepares to Conduct Preliminary Investigation</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The British and French governments have asked Belgian Prime Minister Janson to take the lead in launching a new movement for world trade freedom. It is said that Prime Minister Janson has agreed to accept this invitation. Japanese people are paying close attention to this. The economic community is particularly interested in the Prime Minister's view that trade barriers should be eliminated at this time. Japan's long-standing economic policy has always aimed at allowing free commerce and abolishing various barriers. If this new movement can succeed, the Japanese government will definitely participate in the conference. Trade barriers in the form of quotas were actually first created by British colonies, and other countries then followed suit. According to observers, if British colonies abolish the quota system, other countries will certainly follow suit. If so, one of the biggest obstacles to commerce can be reduced. (Central News Agency, dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] In order to eliminate obstacles to international trade, the British and French governments plan to initiate an international economic conference. The United States and Germany have both expressed their support, so it is likely that the conference will be convened. The Japanese government, which advocates free trade and the redistribution of resources, is extremely concerned about this matter. Although the government has not yet received any expressions of intent regarding the aforementioned conference, the views of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Standing Bureau are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese government, which aims to rebuild the system of free trade, solve the problem of public distribution of resources, and alleviate the anxieties of the world, in order to contribute to world peace, has already clarified its established policy in the diplomatic guidelines of former Foreign Minister Arita. If the international economic conference aims to eliminate economic obstacles, then it is in line with Japan's intentions. A part of Europe does not have some opposition air, therefore, the item conference is not fully formed before the opening, even if the meeting cannot be opened, and if strong Britain can take the lead in cancelling the allocation system and other kinds of commercial obstacles, then other countries will also follow suit, and the world economy can be restored. Therefore, rather than convening a conference, it is better to make a concrete decision to abolish trade barriers. This is the first prerequisite. (Allied Press dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>Brussels Regarding the British and French governments' request that Prime Minister Janson contact various countries in order to remove various obstacles to international trade, especially relaxing import quotas in various countries, Prime Minister Janson recently stated to the press that he would accept to conduct a survey in principle. The Prime Minister also stated that since German Economics Minister and Central Bank President Dr. Schacht will visit here next Tuesday (the 13th of this month), he intends to instruct his younger brother (i.e., a specialist at the League of Nations) to conduct a preliminary investigation into the issue of eliminating trade barriers before Schacht arrives, in order to prepare for the Prime Minister's talks with Schacht. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch of the 7th)</p>
<p>[Paris] German Economics Minister and Central Bank President Dr. Schacht is scheduled to go to Belgium next Tuesday to hold talks with the country's Prime Minister Janson. It is rumored that these talks are related to the initiative launched by the British and French governments to remove various obstacles to international trade. Therefore, the French newspapers attach great importance to this. Among them, "Le Journal" stated that the result of Schacht's trip may allow Germany's current policy of economic self-sufficiency to be slightly modified, and various countries may give certain benefits as compensation. The newspaper also published a message from a Berlin reporter stating that major changes are about to occur in the German economy. In other words, if various countries that trade with Germany remove part of their trade barriers, then Germany's current policy of economic self-sufficiency may be relaxed, which is not necessarily impossible.

<h3>US Department of Commerce Releases Annual Report on Progress in China's Economic Construction</h3>
<p>The Whole Country Presents a Vigorous Atmosphere; The Government's Position is Increasingly Consolidated</p>
<p>[Washington] The US Department of Commerce today released its annual report on China's economic situation. Its content is as follows: "The economic situation in China at the end of 1936 was the best since the founding of the Republic of China. Although there have been several political changes during the year, the result has been to further consolidate the position of the central government. Moreover, with the abundant harvests of grains, the improvement of the monetary system, and the increase in prices, the national economy has presented a vigorous atmosphere. The most noteworthy thing is that the funds that have always remained in Shanghai have gradually flowed to the interior, which shows that the people have developed a sense of trust in the country's progress. However, the above overview cannot be regarded as meaning that China's future is smooth and without worries, because there are still communists unpacified in various parts of the Northwest, and there is a strong neighbor nearby, watching covetously, all of which can reduce the degree of optimism about China. In terms of finance and exchange rates, the past year has had both flaws and advantages. The price of the national currency is very stable, so there is no exchange rate risk for foreign trade. The people have been able to widely and happily use the central government's currency. The implementation of the income tax has also increased the country's income. After the government reorganized its debts, it was able to reduce its expenditures, and the price of government bonds has soared, which has strengthened the government's credit. However, foreign trade still has a large surplus, and the government budget still needs to borrow to make up for it. Fortunately, prices have risen, agricultural products are abundant, and people's purchasing power has increased. At the same time, food imports have decreased, which can be slightly remedied. For example, last year's cotton production was 3.7 million dan, and tobacco was 170 million pounds, both of which broke previous records. The soybean harvest in the four northeastern provinces was also good, and plans are being made to increase wheat production in order to achieve self-sufficiency. Currently, China, including the four northeastern provinces, has a total of 60,000 motorcycles of various types, 75% of which are produced in the United States. In recent years, China's highways have increased by 60,000 miles. Highways are available between Shanghai and Guangzhou, Yunnan, Chengdu, and Lanzhou. The flour industry has benefited greatly because of the abundance of domestic wheat production and the high prices abroad last year. Although the textile industry has made much progress, the yarn factories operated by the Japanese are particularly developed. Currently, China has a total of 5 million yarn spindles, almost half of which belong to the Japanese. However, on the whole, the future of Chinese yarn factories is still promising. Other industries such as cigarettes and cement are all thriving. The Kailan Mining Company, which had suffered losses for many years, was finally able to distribute dividends last year. In terms of transportation, the construction of new railways and the reorganization of existing railways were both good achievements of the past year. The government has also planned a five-year plan, preparing to add 1,600 kilometers each year. If other countries can provide long-term credit, they can compete to invest. Airline routes have also increased by one fold compared to the previous year. The biggest success is that the China National Aviation Corporation has reached an agreement with the Hong Kong government, and once the preparations for the Pacific route are complete, it can load and unload mail in Hong Kong. On the one hand, China has also contacted the British Royal Air Force and the French Air Force, and can travel to Europe. It is difficult to analyze China's foreign trade because the situation is very complicated. Some people estimate that at least 150 million yuan worth of goods were smuggled into the country last year, and the government purchased 100 million yuan worth of military supplies. In terms of goods that pass through customs, imports are 416,500,000 gold units, i.e., 941,500,000 yuan, a decrease of 17% compared to the previous year. Exports were 705,700,000 yuan, an increase of 23% compared to the previous year. In total, the import surplus decreased by 31%. The largest decrease in imports was in food, which shows that China's degree of self-sufficiency has increased. Last year, the United States still ranked first in the volume of trade between various countries and China, followed by Japan, followed by Germany and the United Kingdom."

<h3>International Sugar Conference</h3>
<p>Representatives of Various Countries Speak, Supporting Production and Sales Balance</p>
<p>[London] At today's World Sugar Conference, the Chinese representative, Liu Cuo, gave a speech. Other speakers included Dr. Colijn, the Dutch representative; Watt, the South African representative; Massey, the Canadian representative; Meek, the Indian representative; and representatives from France, Germany, Belgium, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Dominica. According to a bulletin released afterwards, the representatives of various countries were very supportive of establishing an international agreement to achieve a balance between production and sales, but only generally stated that it was possible.

The representatives of various countries have expressed their hope that an agreement can be reached. (Central News Agency, Reuters dispatch of the 6th)</p>
<h3>World Textile Congress</h3>
<p>Sweatshop System Exploits Labor; British Representative Attacks Japan</p>
<p>[Washington] Shaw Asafu, the representative of the British Trades Union Congress attending the World Textile Congress, gave a speech today, supporting the adoption of a 40-hour work week worldwide, and attacking the "sweatshops" of the Japanese industrial sector. He stated that he was very friendly to Japan, so he frankly discussed the Japanese issue. The sweatshop system not only exploits domestic workers, but will also affect workers in other countries. The prosperity of various countries in the world has become an international issue. (National Telegram of the 6th)</p>
<p>[Washington] At today's meeting of the World Textile Congress, Belgium, Canada, and Poland have all supported the proposal for a 40-hour work week. However, the representatives of the Japanese government and capital strongly advocated reducing piece rates and removing tariff barriers, in order to increase the purchasing power of low-wage workers, which is even more important. Yesterday, the British representative expressed opposition to reducing working hours to 40 hours, because if work is reduced, wages will inevitably be reduced as well. The World Textile Conference is hosted by the League of Nations and is attended by 23 countries, including China and Japan. Each country has representatives from the government, labor, and capital.

<h3>Leader of the German Labor Front to Visit Italy in Return</h3>
<p>[Rome] Sir Robert Ley, leader of the German Labor Front, is scheduled to arrive here tomorrow via the port of Venice. He plans to visit Italian government group industrial institutions in the cities of Milan, Turin, Genoa, and Rome. Many Italian cabinet members, such as Foreign Minister Ciano, Minister of Propaganda Alfieri, and Deputy Minister of Aviation General Fanri, have visited Germany in recent years. Therefore, German Defense Minister von Blomberg, Aviation Minister Göring, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, and Foreign Minister Neurath have also often followed Dr. Ley to visit Italy in return. However, whether this level of information is reliable requires careful consideration. (Central News Agency, Havas dispatch of the 7th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Consulate in Tianjin Plans to Expand Concession Area</h3>
<p>Population Swells, Concession Area Insufficient, Plans to Build Haihe River Bridge to Develop Hedong Area</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: In recent years, the number of Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese people migrating to the north has been increasing. Taking the Japanese concession in Tianjin as an example, the population reached more than 20,000 last winter, of which Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese people accounted for more than 12,600. The population within the Japanese concession has long been suffering from expansion. All open land has either been bought by emerging companies or occupied by various industrial groups for the purpose of building houses, or has been opened up by the Japanese Military Headquarters as special agency land, especially smuggling foreign firms, which purchase open land to store private goods in warehouses. Therefore, there is almost no spare land in the Japanese concession. The Japanese military and the police department of the Japanese Consulate in Tianjin have increased their personnel this year. Officers and officials who have brought their families with them have felt the pain of having no place to live. Therefore, many large companies, large foreign firms, and general senior military and police officers, as well as personnel from the South Manchuria Railway Company and the Xingzhong Company, have rented in the French concession. The Japanese Military Headquarters and the Japanese Consulate are therefore making every effort to plan the expansion of the Japanese concession. There used to be a water pit in the Kunlian area of the Japanese and French concessions, covering an area of about 500 mu. The authorities of the French and Japanese concessions separately filled it up in the previous year, and it has been leveled last winter. The Japanese Military Headquarters initially opened it up as a baseball field (the French concession authorities only inserted signs on the occupied part, and there were no buildings). Recently, due to the increased number of new recruits and middle-level generals, many of them have no dormitories, such as staff officers Asai, Kai, and Tominaga, all of whom are staying in the Hibiscus Hall. Therefore, the area was specially opened up as a residential area for military officers. The construction of dormitories started this month and is expected to be completed in July of this year. However, this only solves a small part of the population expansion problem in the Japanese concession. In the future, as Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese people gradually migrate in, the area of the Japanese concession will inevitably become more and more difficult to deal with. Therefore, the Japanese Consulate also plans to develop and prosper in the Hedong area and occupy Special Zone 2 as concession land. A month ago, it tried to communicate the prosperity of the two concessions. It discussed with the Italian concession authorities in Hedong to build a railway bridge across the Haihe River, with a slightly smaller scale and style than the International Bridge. Large ships can also be opened and closed when passing through the river. The cost is about 770,000 yuan, or a tunnel can be dug under the Haihe River to avoid the complexity of opening and closing the bridge. The cost is about 1.3 million yuan. This money is shared by the authorities of the Japanese and Italian concessions, or the Japanese concession bears the pier cost, and the Italian concession bears the bridge or tunnel cost. It is planned that the tunnel or bridge will start from Yamaguchicho in the Japanese concession and end at the river bank in the Italian concession. The Italian concession authorities believe that the area is only a residential area and has always had the desire to prosper in the area. The construction of the Jai Alai stadium earlier was for this purpose. However, the project was completed due to the remote location, the obstruction of the river, and the inconvenient transportation. The prosperity plan was only a dream. This time, the Japanese concession's proposal was strongly supported. After drawing the map, it was sent to the Tianjin Municipal Government in the name of the authorities of the two concessions to request instructions from the Central Government. The Central Government's reply arrived in Tianjin last week and was forwarded to the authorities of the two concessions by the Municipal Government. The Central Government believes that the Japanese side has an attempt to expand the concession and encroach on Special Zone 2 in Hedong (Special Zone 1 is adjacent to the Italian concession). Before we are planning to recover the concession but have not yet implemented it, how can we give imperialists a special opportunity again? Therefore, it was rejected. However, the authorities of the Japanese and Italian concessions still plan to use other strategies to make this happen. (6th)</p>
<h3>Chairman Lin Leaves Guangdong for Guangxi</h3>
<p>Chairman Lin Was Very Interested in Touring When He Was in Guangdong, Will Stay in Guangxi for Three or Four Days Before Returning North</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: National Government Chairman Lin recently arrived in Guangdong. In addition to paying tribute to the revolutionary martyrs and discussing important matters with military and political figures, he has been very interested in touring in recent days. He went to Conghua Hot Spring Resort to stay to avoid the hustle and bustle. Therefore, various merchants in Guangdong who appealed to Chairman Lin for petitions were unable to meet him. Those who stayed by Chairman Lin's side all day were mostly important people. After Chairman Lin paid tribute to the Huanghuagang martyrs, he went to Luofu Mountain, Xiqiao Mountain, and Xinhui Yamen for sightseeing. He did not return to Guangzhou by warship from Yamen until the 3rd of this month. On the 4th, he went to pay tribute to the four martyrs of Honghuagang again. On the morning of the 5th, he attended the memorial week of all walks of life and encouraged party members with Sun Yat-sen's teaching of "using the wise to enlighten the ignorant, and using the enlightened to awaken the ignorant." In the afternoon, he visited famous scenic spots in the suburbs again. That evening, he left Guangdong for Hunan and then entered Guangxi. The Provincial Party Department named and gathered people from all walks of life to prepare a warm send-off. Heads of various agencies and representatives of various groups gathered at the Huangsha Railway Station on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway at 5:00 PM, a total of about a thousand people. The cars of the representatives of various agencies were decorated with golden yellow cloth, with the words "Farewell Chairman Lin Back to the Capital." At 5:30 PM, Chairman Lin and Chief of Staff Lu Chao and others set off from the Yamen and left the city hotel. At that time, those who came to the hotel to see him off included Yu Hanmou, Xiang Hanping, Chen Qingyun, and Chen Ce. Everyone accompanied Chairman Lin to the Huangsha Railway Station by car. The military police and security team along the way provided strict protection. At 5:50 PM, they arrived at Huangsha Station. The people who were there to send them off lined up to pay their respects. The silver orchestra played music loudly. Chairman Lin took the lead in the music and replied to those who were seeing him off, then boarded the car. At 6:00 PM, the Yuehan Railway special train started. Xiang Hanping and others took the same car for another ride. When Chairman Lin's car arrived at Maba Station, he got off the car to visit and admire the golden body of the Sixth Patriarch at Nanhua Temple.

<h3>Chaoshan Commercial Treasury Certificates to Be Terminated Within a Time Limit</h3>
<p>The Department of Finance Strictly Orders Recovery Within Ten Months, Reducing One-Tenth Each Month Starting in March</p>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The Commercial Treasury Certificates circulating in the Shantou market were produced in the summer of the 23rd year of the Republic of China. At that time, the financial resources of Chaoshan were exhausted, and major private banks closed down one after another, unable to recover the guaranteed banknotes issued. The provincial bank banknotes were also insufficient for circulation. In order to rescue the Chaoshan finance, the Department of Finance approved the establishment of the Commercial Treasury Certificate Committee by the Shantou Chamber of Commerce to issue certificates to replace the guarantee certificates issued by commercial private banks. Each private bank or merchant registered their real estate with the Treasury Certificate Committee to guarantee that they could receive certificates for circulation. The original guarantee certificates, whether issued by bankrupt or non-bankrupt private banks, were all converted into certificates. This certificate was denominated in silver dollars, divided into four types: one hundred yuan, fifty yuan, thirty yuan, and twenty yuan, but it was not convertible. The total amount of loans reached a huge amount of 9 million yuan. The regulations stipulated that it would be recovered within six months. Up to now, the extension has been extended six times, and the merchants who received the certificates for circulation are still unwilling to recover them. When the certificates were issued on that day, the value of the industry was not strictly estimated. Occasionally, cheap real estate was secretly exchanged for the deeds registered on a normal day. There were also those who used barren land in Qilu and angular mountain land as guarantees. Therefore, the price of commercial treasury certificates is about one-fifth of the silver dollar standard. The currency system in the market has never been stable. Therefore, the market has formed another financial unit. Commercial treasury certificates exchange for provincial bank place-name silver dollar certificates, and there is a premium of 10 cents. Exchanging for Bank of China silver dollar certificates, there is a premium of 20 cents. The citizens' money deposited in the bank before is now paid in commercial treasury certificates, and they are invisibly losing twice as much. Remittances from overseas Chinese and remittances from various places, once they arrive in Chaoshan, are issued in commercial treasury certificates. The recipients have suffered heavy losses for many years. This not only undermines the unification of the national currency system, but also has a major impact on the people's livelihood. The beneficiaries are only a small number of real estate classes. Therefore, the Department of Finance ordered the Shantou Chamber of Commerce on the 25th to order the Commercial Treasury Certificate Committee to handle the closing procedures within ten days after the document arrives. Starting from March of this year, all businesses that received commercial treasury certificates were required to return one-tenth of the loans each month, recovering 10% according to the amount issued. The entire amount should be recovered and must not exceed ten months. After January 27, this treasury certificate is completely prohibited from being used. If it is still not recovered, the mortgaged property of each merchant will be auctioned off to compensate for the deficiency, and the remaining amount will still be strictly pursued for cleaning up. After receiving this time limit order, all the leaders held a meeting on the 25th and evening. Mayor Huang Bingxun and Zhang Zhi, the president of the Provincial Bank, attended and participated. They all agreed that the current market finance is stable, the legal tender is sufficient, the remittances from Southeast Asia are increasing, and the industrial and commercial vitality is booming. There is no excuse to extend the period again. They immediately voted to comply with the instructions of the Department of Finance and directly sent a letter to each leader, in accordance with the method, to recover 10% of the treasury certificates each month and submit it to the association, and sent a letter to the city's chamber of commerce to inform the industry associations to check and comply, before the New Year's Day next year, to end all of them, and all treasury certificates will no longer be circulated in the market. The private banks that went bankrupt before, due to the guarantee certificates left behind, were converted into commercial treasury certificates, and of course, they could not recover 10% per month. Whether to strictly pursue the responsible persons of each private bank depends on the Shantou Chamber of Commerce to discuss it themselves.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Accrued Interest Ordered to Be Returned</p>
<p>The Wuxi County Land Administration Bureau collected accrued interest for 18 months for those who re-reported the land price after the deadline for land price reporting. Since various public groups telegraphed the state and province, requesting correction, the provincial government has telegraphed the county to suspend collection, and those who have already collected it should be returned together. After receiving the telegram, County Magistrate Long immediately transferred the order to Hu Pinfang, the director of the Land Administration Bureau, to comply. The bureau has already settled the accrued interest that has been collected up to April 2 of this year, totaling 17,532 yuan, 7 jiao, and 5 fen. Yesterday, it formulated a method and announced to the owners to return the receipts for the accrued interest and submit the certificate of land price reporting. The bureau will add a stamp of "Accrued Interest Has Been Returned" and return the amount in full on the same day. The return period is set for two months, from April 7 to June 7. Those who have lost the receipts should submit the land price reporting certificate to the bureau for verification and registration from April 8 to May 7. From May 8 to June 7, it is the return period. The returned accrued interest will be published in the National Guidance Daily every day, household by household. Those who have not collected it after the deadline will also be announced household by household in the newspaper, and the remaining amount will be deposited in the county treasury.</p>
<p>Ba長 Extorted and Arrested</p>
<p>A resident of Xishuiguan, Pei, is a descendant of Pei Dazongcai, the magistrate of Wuxi in the Qing Guangxu period. He has a history of mental illness, often shouting, and is addicted to smoking. He has a Type A license. Xiang Lanchu, the chief of the Bao, has repeatedly extorted money from Pei under the guise of smoking. Recently, Xiang again extorted a large sum of money from Pei for allegedly possessing opium. Pei's wife could not bear the harassment and entrusted a relative to telegraph the province to request investigation and handling. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government sent Gu Jiaoruo, a section member, to Wuxi for a secret investigation. Yesterday, it telegraphed the county government to send the police to investigate Xiang. After interrogation, he was detained and awaiting legal action. Mo Wenchao, a clerk of the town office, was also involved and is said to have fled.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Yongdong Township Residents Petition</p>
<p>In order to improve the quality of raw silk and improve silk reeling technology, and to inspect the quality of cocoons in various counties of the province for reference in adjusting cocoon prices, the Department of Construction has specially established a silk reeling factory in the provincial capital. The factory site has been found in Sanwanzi, Yongdong Township. However, there are more than 100 households and more than 300 people living there, most of whom are poor farmers. The construction of a silk factory there requires more than 100 mu of land. In the future, the residents' accommodation will inevitably become a problem. Wang Chenglong and many others were jointly elected to go to the Provincial Department and various party and government agencies to plead for the recall of the order and to find another location to build the silk reeling factory, so as to avoid the residents being displaced.</p>

<p>Intercepting the Minister's Sedan Chair to Sue for a Murder Case</p>
<p>Wang Yongbin, the Minister of Justice, inspected various counties in Jiangbei. When he arrived in Yangzhou, the car passed the Tongsibiao Bridge in the old city. Li Zaitian, an old man from the countryside who was nearly ancient, held a petition in his hand and shouted injustice. At that time, the guards shouted in unison. Wang suddenly ordered the car to stop and ordered the person who shouted the injustice to approach the car, received the petition and asked who the lawyer was. He answered Jiang Cha and then ordered the bailiff to take the old man to the court behind the Yushi Temple and personally inquired. Director Gu Fang said, "Is such a murder case sentenced to four months in prison for hindering freedom?" He also asked where the files were. Fang replied that they were transferred from the Fifth Branch. Wang told the old man to report to the Ministry of Justice, which would be accepted immediately. It is reported that the case was that the old man's son ran away with his mistress. The woman's family chased him from Gujing Temple to Qilidian and was caught. The old man's son asked the Zhao鄉長 in charge to send him to the official and not hand him over to the pursuers to take him back. As a result, he was handed over to the pursuers, who tied him up, threw him into the river, and drowned him. Later, the villagers reported that he had accidentally fallen into the water. After the body was sued in court, he was sentenced to four months in prison. He refused to accept the appeal and the original judgment was revoked and he was declared innocent.</p>

On the 5th of this month, Qingming Festival, while sweeping the tomb, he dug a deep pool in front of the ancestral tomb. His mother, Lu, who was over 70 years old, was tricked by Atang into inspecting the ancestral tomb. Suddenly, he pushed her into the pool and covered it with soil, intending to bury her alive. Fortunately, many woodcutters on the mountain heard the cries for help and rescued her and sent her home.

<h3>General Labor Union Cables for Exemption of Unified Tax on Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce, in view of the report that the government is about to increase the unified tax on cotton yarn, which is of great importance to domestic industry, sent a telegram to the Central Political Committee, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, requesting a temporary exemption in order to maintain the yarn industry. The original text reads: "To Chairman Wang of the Nanjing Central Political Committee, Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan, Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry, and Acting Minister Zou of the Ministry of Finance, A perusal of news reports indicates that the unified tax on cotton yarn is about to be increased. We believe that this matter is of great importance to the industrial lifeblood of our nation. An investigation reveals that among domestic industries, only the cotton textile industry within light industry is relatively presentable. However, it has been through years of hardship and teetering on the brink of danger. Recently, although the economic situation has slightly improved and there has been a slight upturn, foreign factories in North China are expanding greatly, relying on their financial resources, skills, and special status to compete with Chinese factories. Therefore, it is difficult to predict how long the current upturn can last, and it is urgent to quickly seek ways to maintain it as a precautionary measure. If the unified tax is suddenly increased at this time, adding to the burden, Chinese yarn mills will inevitably return to the path of suspension of work and sale. The impact on the entire national economy is by no means insignificant. Therefore, we respectfully request that the unified tax on cotton yarn be temporarily exempted. Even for the sake of tax revenue, it is appropriate to postpone it slightly or seek other remedial measures to maintain the cotton industry. We are deeply grateful. Guo Shun, Chairman of the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Chairman Jiang's Reply Telegram Arrives in Shanghai Regarding Participation in the Paris Exposition</h3>
<p>The preparations for China's participation in the Paris Exposition and the exhibition of products are complete. In addition to the competition products collected in Shanghai from various provinces, the Hebei-Ningxia Political Affairs Committee also organized a product collection branch, collecting more than 1,700 kinds of special products from Hebei and Chahar provinces and held a preview in Beiping. The audience was very enthusiastic. The other day, the initiators, various collection committees, group exhibitors, and product exhibitors held a joint meeting at the World Society. Everyone agreed that all matters were fully prepared, and the personnel of the representative office were ready to depart. It was unanimously proposed that the initiators, product committee members, and all exhibitors jointly telegraph Chairman Jiang and relevant ministers of various yuan, requesting government support. It is learned that Chairman Jiang's reply telegram has arrived in Shanghai, stating, "Your telegram has been received. Regarding China's participation in the Paris Exposition, I have telegraphed Director He of the Executive Yuan to handle it. I am sending this telegram to inform you. I hope you will investigate and inform all sectors concerned. Jiang Zhongzheng, Slightly confidential, Stream Seal."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Sends Personnel to Handle Tea Inspection</h3>
<p>Ten Regions in Four Provinces and Shanghai; Heads of Operations Departed Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Industry implemented export inspection, the reputation of Chinese tea in foreign markets has been greatly enhanced. However, export inspection is implemented after the tea transaction is completed, and only has a direct relationship with the exporter. The producer in the mainland still has to go through six or seven intermediaries, so government decrees are often not easy to penetrate. If the quality, packaging, and coloring of export inspection do not meet the standards promulgated by the Ministry, although export is prohibited, the result is only a loss for the merchant. The producer in the mainland not only does not understand the reason for the prohibition, but also does not know the fact of the prohibition. Therefore, exporters often have such difficulties and request the implementation of local product inspection. After the implementation of origin inspection, it can not only make up for the deficiencies of export inspection, but also guide tea farmers and tea factories to improve production, so that quality can be improved, packaging can be improved, coloring can be eliminated, and the practice of crude manufacturing, adulteration, and counterfeiting can be eliminated. In view of this, the Ministry of Industry has established the Tea Origin Inspection and Supervision Office this year to comprehensively handle origin inspection matters. According to investigations, the office has selected important tea producing and manufacturing areas in Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shanghai to establish offices to guide tea factories to improve manufacturing and handle origin inspection matters. The purpose of the office is to improve the quality of tea, so it does not charge any fees. The inspection policy is mainly to improve packaging and eliminate coloring in green tea areas, and to implement moisture inspection and quality inspection in addition to packaging in black tea areas. It is reported that the office has reached cooperation with local tax authorities and transportation agencies. All tea that has not been inspected and obtained a certificate of conformity will not be allowed to declare taxes or leave the country, so the quality of tea this year will definitely be improved. It is also reported that the office has reached the tea season and assigned inspectors yesterday to guide and inspect in various places. The location of each office and the director of each office are listed below. ㊀ Qimen District, located in Qimen County, Anhui Province, Director Xiang Gengyou. ㊁ Zhide District, located in Yaodu Street, Zhide County, Anhui Province, Director Zhang Wei. ㊂ Fuliang District, located in Jingdezhen, Jiangxi Province, Director Su Qiongchun. ㊃ Ningzhou District, located in Xiushui Tea Farm, Xiushui County, Jiangxi Province, Director Fang Hanzhou. ㊄ Pingshui District, located in Sanjie, Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, Director Liu Hezhou. ㊅ Wenzhou District, located in the Tea Industry Association of Wenzhou, Zhejiang Province, Director Huang Guoguang. ㊆ Tunxi District, located in Tunxi Town, Xiuning County, Anhui Province, Director Zhang Wei. ㊇ Fuzhou District, located in Fuzhou, Fujian Province, Director Xu Zongjia. ㊈ Fuding Sub-district, located in Shacheng, Fuding County, Fujian Province, Director Tang Cheng. ㊉ Tuzhuang District, located at 1040 North Suzhou Road, Shanghai, Director Jiang Xuekai. It is now heard that the directors of each district have carried inspection instruments, supplies, etc., and set off on different routes yesterday.</p>
<h3>Ningjing Steamer Crew's Wage Reduction Turmoil Resolved</h3>
<p>Xinlao Ningshao Sailed Last Night; Ningjing Crew Still Have Expectations</p>
<p>The entire crew of the Ningshao Company's Ningjing steamer repeatedly requested to be exempt from the company's wage reduction, but to no avail. Yesterday, when the ship returned to Shanghai, it immediately went on strike and issued a declaration with four demands (see yesterday's newspaper advertisement). It also reported to the five guilds of marine engineers, drivers, etc., requesting assistance. The Shanghai-Ningbo liner Xin Ningshao and the Yangtze liner Lao Ningshao immediately came to the rescue and went on strike together. Passengers going to Ningbo were in an uproar yesterday because the Xin Ningshao could not sail. The Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association specially sent representatives Chen Yiting, Ye Xianggao, Li Yaoting, and Mao Heyuan to mediate. The Ningshao Company sent Zhang Yanling, and the crew entrusted Feng Yuming, Jiang Keni, Hu Zhining, and Lu Liangbing of the Marine Engineers Association as representatives. At 5:30 PM, they went to the Hengshe to hold a mediation meeting. Finally, Du Yuesheng came forward to mediate. ㊀ The crew of the Ningjing steamer will restore their original salary. ㊁ The Xin Ningshao steamer will immediately resume work and sail as usual to facilitate traffic. Du also entrusted Lu Jingshi to earnestly state his responsibility to the representatives. The matter was brought to an end. The Xin Ningshao steamer sailed at 7 PM that night, and the Lao Ningshao also sailed that night. However, the Ningjing crew will have to wait for the four demands and job security issues to be resolved at 9 AM today by the Seamen's Union, the Maritime Affairs Bureau, and other party and government agencies before resuming work.</p>
<h3>Workers at Xinyu No. 1 Factory Resumed Work, but Went on Strike Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Dismissal of Workers Case; Mediation Fails</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the labor unrest in the Xinyu Yarn Factory No. 1 and No. 2 in western Shanghai, after persuasion by party and government agencies, both labor and management complied with the order and resumed work simultaneously on the morning of the 6th. The Social Bureau, together with the Municipal Party Headquarters, planned to mediate the dispute over the dismissal of workers at 9:00 AM yesterday. Because the opinions of both parties did not converge, Xu Yefu, chief of the third section of the bureau, declared to both labor and management on the spot that he would go to the factory with personnel from the Municipal Party Headquarters on the 8th (today) to investigate and then schedule a mediation meeting. However, the day shift workers of Xinyu No. 1 Factory on West Suzhou Road suddenly went on strike again at 5:00 PM yesterday. Despite the factory's persuasion, it was ineffective, and the night shift workers also did not report for work after hearing the news. The Xinyu No. 2 Factory on Robert Sheng Road, however, continued to operate normally and no disputes occurred.</p>
<h3>Representatives Returning to Shanghai to Petition on the Case of Tax-Free Imported Rice in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Yuan Refers to Finance and Industry Ministries for Review; Representatives to Go to Nanjing Again if Necessary</p>
<p>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce representative Luo Qinghua, and representatives of rice grain industries from various provinces and cities, Gu Xinyi and Chen Ziyi, went to Nanjing again to petition for the tax-free imported rice case in Guangdong Province. The Executive Yuan re-discussed the matter at a regular meeting on the 6th and decided to refer it to the finance and industry ministries and related agencies for review before submitting it to the Yuan meeting for discussion. The three representatives returned to Shanghai by night train the day before yesterday, believing that the petition had achieved considerable results. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited the representatives yesterday and learned the details of the situation as follows. This time, they went to Nanjing again, first to the Ministry of Industry to petition, where they were received by Vice Minister Cheng Zhou and expressed sympathy for the petition. Then, they went to the Executive Yuan, where they were received by Acting Secretary-General He, who stated that he had recently received telegrams from Chairman He of Hunan Province and Chairman Huang of Hubei Province, requesting a ban. He stated that it was necessary to reconsider the matter, so he submitted it to the Yuan meeting on the 6th. The representatives met with people from all walks of life in Nanjing, who unanimously agreed with the petition. The Nanjing General Chamber of Commerce has also submitted a petition to the Yuan Ministry to support it, believing that the dumping of foreign rice over the years has been the main cause of the collapse of rural areas. Since the bumper harvest last autumn, and the simultaneous unified collection of foreign rice taxes in Guangdong Province, imports of foreign rice have decreased, and domestic rice has been sold smoothly. Therefore, the rural economy has gradually shown signs of recovery. The cause and effect of this are very obvious. Although Guangdong Province lacks rice, it has been continuously transported from various provinces, and the government has specially allowed the import of 1 million dan of foreign rice at half tax. The rice price has been restored, and the province is located in Lingnan, with a warm climate. Rice ripens early, and new rice will be seen at the end of June. It is less than three months from now. The province sells about 20,000 shi of rice per day, and the total amount will be only 1 million shi in three months. Now, there are more than 10 million shi of surplus rice in various provinces, not to mention the 500,000 shi stored in the province, and about 1 million shi are waiting to be transported. There is no need for tax-free imported rice. The Ministry of Finance also needs to consider this. On February 27, the Ministry of Finance approved the Hubei Telegram of the Hankou Miscellaneous Grain Association, saying that it should be handled in accordance with the Executive Yuan's proposal, without tax exemption, and ordered rice merchants in various provinces to transport rice to Guangdong to provide assistance. Unexpectedly, on March 15, a deletion telegram was suddenly issued allowing 1 million dan of tax-free imports of foreign rice and foreign grain. It is assumed that the central government could not withstand the repeated requests of Guangdong Province and had to comply with its request. As for why Guangdong Province must purchase tax-free foreign rice in the year of the domestic rice harvest, the original intent is incomprehensible. Now, the 2 million shi to be transported as mentioned above were originally ordered by merchants to comply with. It is hoped that the Ministries of Finance and Industry will be able to make appropriate arrangements when deliberating. Some say that domestic rice is no longer in the hands of farmers, and the import of foreign rice does not hinder the rural economy. This may have been the case a few years ago, but it is not the case now. One is because of the bumper harvest last autumn, farmers have stored a lot of wealth and have not completely sold it. Second, farmers are unwilling to sell easily after the implementation of the legal currency policy. Third, there are farmers' banks or warehouses set up by borrowing from associations in various places, and farmers' rice grains, no matter how much, can be mortgaged. It is extremely common for them to store them for sale. Recently, due to the implementation of tax-free foreign rice imports in Guangdong Province, domestic rice prices in various places have plummeted by 2.56 yuan, and the impact on farmers is definitely not insignificant. Even the financial circles in various places will suffer losses due to the plunge in rice prices and the mortgage of rice. Therefore, this move is not only a problem for some rice merchants in various provinces, but also has a great relationship with the entire national economy, people's livelihood, and agricultural and commercial economy. According to the representatives, since Minister Wu of the Ministry of Industry and Vice Minister Xu of the Ministry of Finance were not in Nanjing this time, and Acting President Wang of the Executive Yuan was not seen, they will ask the Municipal General Chamber of Commerce to send a telegram to state the matter and ask for support. The representatives previously sent from the provinces of Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu are still waiting in Shanghai for orders. If necessary, they plan to go to Nanjing for the third time to petition.</p>
<h3>Beijing-Ganzhou Railway Loan Syndicate Pays Three Installments</h3>
<p>Amounting to 3 Million Yuan; Eight Banks Allotted as Scheduled</p>
<p>According to Xinxin News Agency, the Ministry of Railways borrowed 14 million yuan from eight banks, including the Bank of Communications, to expand the Beijing-Ganzhou Railway from Xuancheng to Guixi, which will be used to purchase building materials and engineering expenses. At the time of signing the contract, the syndicate first allocated 3 million yuan and then continued to allocate 3 million yuan for the second time in January of this year. Now that the third payment period has arrived, the reporter learned from the syndicate that eight banks, including the Bank of Communications, the Chinese Farmers' Bank, Jincheng, Dalu, Yanye, Zhongnan, the Four Banks, and Zhejiang Yeye, have all allotted the funds to the syndicate according to the proportion of the borrowed amount, totaling 3 million yuan, which will be submitted to the Ministry of Railways for application. The above three installments total 9 million yuan, and the remaining 5 million will be paid in July (3 million yuan) and September (2 million yuan). The progress of the project is quite fast. Tens of thousands of workers are building the earthwork of the entire section, and most of it has been completed. After passing through the current season, the application materials for installing sleepers and laying tracks can be carried out. Except for a part of the sleepers purchased from abroad, most of the goods are undertaken by wood merchants from Xuancheng, Ning, Ji, and She counties in Anhui Province. The electric wire and telephone materials used along the route are continuously hired by Shanghai and transported to Wuhu by ship, and then transferred to the Xuancheng Engineering Office by the Jiangnan Railway for preparation. The entire project is expected to be completed and opened to traffic within the scheduled time.</p>

<h3>Business Situation of the Local Foundry Industry</h3>
<p>High Raw Material Prices Make It Difficult to Compete with Foreign Merchants: Zhou Cuqing, Chairman of the Shanghai Foundry Industry Association, told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday that there are about 150 foundries in Shanghai, of which only a few are operated by foreign merchants. In recent years, the business situation has been extremely bleak. High raw material prices make it difficult to operate. Recently, countries have expanded their armaments, and imports of foreign iron have decreased. Chinese factories all use domestic Yangtze pig iron, but its price is as high as foreign iron. Therefore, various industries have gradually prospered recently, while our industry is still struggling. In the previous Qingdao municipal government bid for water pipes and parts, etc., totaling hundreds of thousands of yuan, many foreign merchants bid, and three or four Chinese merchants in Shanghai also participated. Among them, the Liuhegou Iron Manufacturing Company abandoned the water pipes and only bid for small parts. As a result of the bidding, it was won by the foreign Mitsui Yangxing Company. However, the bid price of the Chinese merchants was not much different from that of the foreign merchants. If the Liuhegou Iron Manufacturing Company could participate in the main water pipe part, it would definitely win the bid, but the company failed to consider this. The association will hold a members' meeting on the 15th of this month, at which the pig iron raw materials will be discussed. It is heard that Mr. Zhou is the general manager of Xiangfeng Direct Pouring Iron Pipe Factory and has just returned from Qingdao after bidding. The bid price of the factory was very close to that of Mitsui Yangxing, which won the bid, so it ranked second.</p>
<h3>US Increases Egg Production Import Tax; Our Egg Factories Oppose</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Egg Factory Industry Association has recently learned that the United States plans to increase the import tax on our country's egg production and cancel the subsidies for our egg merchants, which has a great relationship with the future of our international trade. Therefore, they have risen up in opposition and intend to submit a document to our foreign affairs authorities to vigorously prevent it. In addition, a person in charge of the association told a reporter yesterday that Sino-US relations have indeed improved in recent years, and egg exports have also increased slightly last year. However, if the news is true, it will have a greater impact on domestic exports, and our egg factory industry will definitely strive for it.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Authorities Telegraph Request for Baker to Enter Sichuan</h3>
<p>Assisting with Sichuan Disaster Relief Affairs</p>
<p>Liu Xiang, Chairman of Sichuan Province, and Mr. He Beiheng, yesterday telegraphed Mr. Baker of the China International Famine Relief Commission, welcoming him to enter Sichuan to assist with relief affairs. The two telegrams are recorded below: ㊀ Zhang Shulin of Minsheng Company, forwarded to Mr. Baker of the China International Famine Relief Commission: The drought in Sichuan Province is extremely severe.

Liu Xiang, Seal of the Provincial Government, Yang. ㊁ Manager Zhang Shulin, brother, please translate and forward to Mr. Baker: Colleagues are eagerly awaiting your arrival in Sichuan to guide the relief work here. We specially telegraph to welcome you and look forward to your visit. Younger brother He Beiheng bows, Yang.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Announces Reasons for Closure of China Merchants Inland River Bureau</h3>
<p>Huge Losses and Deep-Seated Malpractices Made Reorganization Difficult, Employees' Request Rejected</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications ordered the closure of the China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau, its assets were taken over by the state-run China Merchants Bureau, and the ships were publicly auctioned. Employees and contractors on various routes petitioned separately, requesting the revocation of the decision to avoid the unemployment of thousands of employees. It is reported that in addition to rejecting the employees' request, the Ministry of Communications also announced the reasons for the closure, which briefly stated: The China Merchants Inland River Steamship Bureau was founded in the 28th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty. The China Merchants General Bureau invested 50,000 taels of silver to take over the utilization of the Steamship Bureau and established the China Merchants Inland River Steamship Company, operating only on the Shanghai-Changzhou route. Later, the Inland River Company expanded extravagantly, but due to poor management for five years, debts increased daily. By 1930, the China Merchants General Bureau had advanced too much money and was unable to manage it, so it leased it to the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Construction for operation. When the lease expired in June 1935, the ships were returned in a dilapidated condition. The state-run China Merchants Bureau勉強 (mianqiang, barely) repaired them and continued operations, but the losses from the self-operated part continued to increase. Contractors only sought profits, resulting in numerous malpractices that damaged the reputation of the state-run enterprise. The state-run China Merchants Bureau repeatedly reported and sent personnel to investigate, and it was found that the Inland River Bureau had too many deep-seated problems, making reorganization extremely difficult. It owed the state-run China Merchants Bureau more than 500,000 yuan. The Bureau needed to focus on the development of ocean shipping and had no spare capacity to attend to the Inland River Bureau. Moreover, with the opening of highways in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, inland river shipping was gradually declining. Therefore, it was decided to close the Inland River Bureau.</p>

<h3>Special Maritime Affairs Division of the Chinese Nationalist Party Moves to New Office Address</h3>
<p>Zhonghua Road Mansion</p>
<p>The Special Maritime Affairs Division of the Chinese Nationalist Party, the highest organization for handling national maritime affairs, has seen significant progress since the Central Committee member and commander Yang Xiaotian took over as special commissioner. The Division is now relocating from its old offices on Zhaojia Road, which are no longer sufficient for its needs, to the Zhonghua Road Mansion, No. 680, Da Nan Men. They will be set up immediately and will formally open for business tomorrow (the 8th).</p>
<h3>County Government Strictly Cracks Down on Smuggling</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has investigated and found that the trend of smuggling has been prevalent recently. The county's jurisdiction, connecting Kunshan and Shanghai, with numerous railway lines, is a vital transportation hub in and out of the interior. Therefore, in addition to ordering the County Police Bureau yesterday to instruct subordinate police stations at ports and railway stations to increase patrols and strictly crack down on smuggling, it also sent letters to the First District of the Water Police and the First District of the Tax Police to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River National Products Inspection Group to Depart in Groups Soon</h3>
<p>In order to promote domestic business and expand the sale of national products, the Shanghai National Products Promotion Association is organizing the Yangtze River National Products Inspection Group. After several meetings, all inspection plans have been finalized. It is reported that the group of five will depart on the 20th of this month and will be divided into two groups for a two-month inspection. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Two Groups for Inspection The inspection group is now divided into two groups. The first group, including Lin Kecong and Huang Bingpei, will depart from Shanghai and travel along the Yangtze River to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Jiujiang, Nanchang, Hankou, and then south along the Yuehan Railway to Yuezhou, Changsha, Hengyang, and other places for inspection. The second group, including Lu Lihua, will go directly to Sichuan Province and inspect the major cities of Wanxian, Chongqing, Fengdu, Fuling, Chengdu, and Jiading. After two months, they will return to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Main Points of Inspection The main points of this inspection are to lay the foundation for the future development of the national products industry, so it is very important. After careful consideration, they are roughly summarized into four points: ㊁ Investigate the sales of national products and the comparison with the sales of foreign goods in various ports along the Yangtze River in recent years, as well as the dynamics of national product sales companies in various ports, the local people's understanding of national products, and their preferences and criticisms after various uses, so as to gain insight into general opinions and provide a reference for national product factories. ㊁ Promote the current state of production of various national product factories in Shanghai, and the progress made in their products in recent years, and use written and material promotion, while expounding the progress and achievements of the national product movement, so that various ports will respond and know what to imitate. ㊂ Establish close contact with local government offices, as well as industrial and commercial education institutions, women's organizations, and organizations in charge of the national product industry, so that they can form a unified force and carry out a more advanced national product movement. ㊃ Try to establish national product companies, joint national product factory sales offices, national product promotion offices, and local product and national product exchange offices in various places, so that local products and manufactured goods can be communicated and linked to expand inter-provincial trade.</p>

<h3>Jiangxi Provincial Chamber of Commerce Again Contends for Tax Exemption on Guangdong Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday received a joint telegram from the Jiangxi Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, the Nanchang Chamber of Commerce, and others, requesting unanimous efforts to fight for tax exemption on Guangdong province foreign rice. The exchange of telegrams is recorded below: ㊀ Jiangxi Telegraph: To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce: Recently, a telegram was sent to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, stating: "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance: The tax exemption on foreign rice has caused protests from various provinces, public opinion is in an uproar, farmers are weeping, and all industries are lamenting. The huge impact is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is truly tantamount to leading a wolf into the house for foreigners to use economic aggression to plan against us. Our government is constantly talking about helping the rural areas and protecting commerce. Why should we only follow the request of Guangdong province alone and disregard the needs of the whole situation? Moreover, the Yangtze River basin has had bumper harvests everywhere, and the amount of rice transported from other provinces to Guangdong is more than one million dan. The sales channels are obstructed, and the losses are worrying. Cheap grain hurts farmers and affects national politics. It is requested that you comprehensively consider the overall situation and reverse the difficult situation. Should the rice tax be exempted, please decisively preside over the matter. We bow our heads and shout for justice, and await your decision with trepidation." Therefore, we urgently telegraph you to unanimously strive for tax exemption to save farmers and protect commerce. We are sincerely grateful. The Jiangxi Provincial Chamber of Commerce Federation, Nanchang Chamber of Commerce, Qianye Guild, Grain Industry Guild, Rice Industry Guild, Cloth Industry Guild, Dried Fruits and Southern Goods Industry Guild, and various industry guilds, bow, Jiang Yin. ㊁ Shanghai Reply: Received the Jiangxi telegram. Regarding the tax exemption on imported foreign rice in Guangdong Province, our association has already telegraphed twice to protest. Recently, we have also appointed representatives to prepare a petition and go with rice industry leaders to the capital to petition the relevant departments. We still hope that your association will also send a telegram directly to the Yuan and ministries to express the unanimity of public opinion, which may lead to a change. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows, Yu.</p>
<h3>Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court Indicts Shen Junru and Others (Continued)</h3>
<p>(V) Letter from Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong to Shen Junru and others (a printed document) stated: "We believe that the constitution and the National Assembly Organization Law and Election Law promulgated by the Nanjing government on May 5th are anti-democratic. We cannot recognize the right of the National Assembly organized according to these laws to represent the will of the people of the whole country." "We believe that the existence of this National Assembly is harmful." "We hope that you and all national salvation organizations will send representatives to participate in the Soviet government." The criticism of the constitution in this letter coincides with the defendants' statement that "a constitution containing ceremonial music is superfluous." Furthermore, Mao Zedong's letter not only did not express any intention to automatically abolish the Soviet government, but also hoped that various organizations would send representatives to participate. The defendants, considering that this was a response to the National Salvation Association, actually handed over this reactionary publication by Zhang Naiqi to Luo Qing, ordering him to be responsible for organizing the Jiangsu National Salvation United Association (see Luo Qing's previous statements). Yet they still claim that "there was no intention to endanger the Republic of China." Who can believe that?</p>
<p>(VI) The defendants, except for firmly denying that they had incited students to strike, did not deny the organization of a workers' strike support association, and stated, "The Workers' National Salvation Association also joined the Shanghai National Salvation United Association." In the leaflet distributed in the name of the National Salvation Association to appeal for the 3.5 million citizens of Shanghai, it was also stated, "These more than 200,000 workers can be trained to be heroes who charge into battle." The defendants spared no effort to incite workers with limited knowledge to achieve their illegal goals. Yet the defendants still argued that "the intention was to save the country and there was no other purpose," which is clearly a false statement.</p>
<p>(VII) The "Struggle Newspaper" published by the Communist Party was found in Zou Taofen's home. Although it criticized "Zhang Naiqi as a Stalinist of the traitorous class" and stated, "The national salvation front opposing the Zhang Naiqis has no political ambition and no intention to seize power, leading to patriotism and reducing the power of struggle," even if it were as stated, it only meant that their主張 (zhuzhang, advocacy, position) was different from the Trotskyist faction of extreme leftists and was still incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. It is difficult to use this as evidence favorable to the defendants.</p>
<p>(VIII) Although the defendants claimed, "They have no relationship with the Third International," the "People's United Front" is the slogan passed by the Seventh Congress of the Third International. The resolution on the establishment of the People's United Front in China stated, "In China, it is necessary to link the expansion of the Soviet movement and the consolidation of the fighting power of the Red Army with the development of the people's movement throughout China." "The Soviets should become the center of the liberation struggle of the Chinese people." Furthermore, the Chinese Communist Party stated regarding the establishment of the Chinese People's United Front, "Under the name of national salvation, launch a struggle against the current government" and "oppose the current government and the Kuomintang" (see the Central Daily News, February 4, 1937, attached). The slogans advocated by the defendants were based on the resolution passed by the Congress of the Third International, and they repeatedly stated in various publications, "It is not easy to suppress the Communists" and "We do not believe that the Kuomintang can monopolize national salvation." In the fifth point of the "Several Basic Conditions for Unity against Aggression and the Minimum Requirements," it was stated, "We support this policy of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Red Army." This is especially consistent with the aforementioned resolution of the Third International and cannot absolve them of the crime of endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<p>(IX) Regarding the Xi'an Incident on December 12th of last year, Zhang Xueliang's proposed eight demands included "Accommodating all parties and factions responsible for saving the country" and "Immediately releasing the arrested patriotic leaders in Shanghai" and "Immediately convening a national salvation conference." Although the defendants firmly claimed, "They had no knowledge of the matter" and stated that "When the National Salvation United Association of All Circles was established on May 31st of last year, we had not yet heard of a national salvation association in Xi'an," the inaugural issue of the National Salvation Intelligence on May 6th of last year had the entry "The tragic national salvation movement of students in Xi'an" and "All schools in Xi'an have organizations of the National Salvation Association." The fifteenth issue of the intelligence contained a detailed description of the establishment of the Northwest National Salvation United Association, stating, "We reprinted more than 2,000 copies of the National Salvation Association's declaration and program, which have been widely distributed." It is evident that the defendants' claim that "there was no national salvation association in Xi'an" is a deliberate attempt to evade responsibility. Furthermore, the seventeenth issue of the National Salvation Intelligence on November 22nd carried a telegram from the National Salvation United Association of All Circles to Zhang Xueliang in Xi'an, "The previous part is omitted. We hope that you will firmly uphold the proposition of immediate resistance against Japan, and urgently and decisively demand that the Central Government immediately stop the Nanjing diplomatic negotiations and launch a nationwide war of resistance against Japan. We also telegraph to various military leaders to unanimously urge the Central Government to send troops to aid Suiyuan. The situation is urgent and the country is in danger. Please take action immediately." Only a short time after this telegram was sent, the Xi'an Incident occurred, and Zhang Xueliang's telegram clearly used the release of the defendants as a condition. Moreover, the propositions they advocated were exactly the same. It can be confirmed that there was mutual contact. Although the defendants' original telegram only encouraged Zhang Xueliang to unite various generals to urge the government to send troops abroad, it cannot prove that the Xi'an Uprising was planned by the defendants. However, their collusion with the military, seeking actions beyond the bounds of the law, eventually led to a major change, almost shaking the foundation of the country. Under the name of saving the country, the government has its own overall plan. Even if the defendants truly had patriotic zeal, they should have wholeheartedly contributed and proceeded consistently under the leadership of the government in order to achieve results. However, they pretended to unite various parties and factions and privately established the National Salvation United Association. Their advocacy of establishing a separate anti-Japanese regime was especially in line with Zhang Xueliang's telegram's so-called proposal to reorganize the government. In addition, they distributed various publications, advocating fallacies such as the People's National Salvation Front, confusing the public and creating division between the people and the government. It is their purpose to endanger the Republic of China by organizing a group and promoting doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. The evidence of their guilt is conclusive.</p>
<p>(X) Qu Qing admitted that he was responsible for organizing the Jiangsu National Salvation United Association and stated, "When I contacted Zhang Naiqi, Shen Junru and Zou Taofen were also present." In addition, the following items were found on his person: ㊀ Declaration of the National Salvation United Association of All Circles, ㊁ Preliminary Political Program for Resistance against Japan and National Salvation, ㊂ Several Basic Conditions for Unity against Aggression and the Minimum Requirements, ㊃ Letter from the Communist Party to the Kuomintang, ㊄ Oil-printed reply from Mao Zedong, ㊅ Wooden chop of the preparatory committee of the Jiangsu National Salvation United Association, etc. This is sufficient to prove that he participated in a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China, which is not false. According to the law, he should be considered a joint principal offender. Gu Liuxin and Ren Songgao admitted that they were members of the Shanghai Vocational Circles National Salvation Association. Ren Songgao also served as a director of the association. On the other hand, they and Zhang Zhongmian, Chen Daohong, Chen Zhuo, and two others separately held leaflets from the Shanghai National Salvation United Association and presented a petition in the name of the representatives of the National Salvation Association requesting the restoration of freedom for Shen Junru and others. The visiting leaflets and the National Crisis News published by the National Salvation Association held by Gu Liuxin were respectively seized and filed. This is also sufficient to prove that their participation in the crime was based on a common intention and should also be regarded as a joint principal offender.</p>
<h3>Articles of Law Violated</h3>
<p>In summary, the defendants Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Ji Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, Tao Xingzhi, Luo Qing, Gu Liuxin, Ren Songgao, Zhang Zhongmian, Chen Daohong, and Chen Zhuo jointly organized a group with the purpose of endangering the Republic of China and promoted doctrines incompatible with the Three Principles of the People. According to Article 11 and Article 18 of the Criminal Law, they are co-offenders in the crime of Article 6 of the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China. Except for Tao Xingzhi, Zhang Zhongmian, Chen Daohong, and Chen Zhuo, whose whereabouts are unknown and have been issued with arrest warrants, they are jointly prosecuted according to Article 230 and Article 243 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The case files and evidence are submitted for review and trial according to the law.</p>
<p>Respectfully submitted to the Criminal Division of this court. Twelve volumes of files and evidence are enclosed, detailed in the catalog.</p>
<p>Defendants Shen Junru, Wang Zaoshi, Li Gongpu, Sha Qianli, Zhang Naiqi, Zou Taofen, Shi Liang, and Luo Qing (all eight in custody), Gu Liuxin and Ren Songgao (both two released on bail). April 3, 1937, Weng Zannian, Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at around 1 a.m., Pan Xiutong, a patrol officer from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Water Patrol Team, along with police officers, was inspecting passengers at various docks along the banks of the Nanshi River.

<h3>Antimony Preparations for Treating Kala-Azar</h3>
<p>Urgent Demand, Difficult to Obtain; Wu Zhou Pharmacy Will Soon Have It for Sale</p>
<p>The Educational Medicine, Volume 1, Issue 10, published by the Medical Education Committee of the Ministry of Education, contains an article on the chemical treatment of Kala-Azar by Dr. Zhu Hengbi. The article states that Kala-Azar originated in Shandong and has since spread to the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins, including Hebei, Henan, Anqing, Hubei, and northern Jiangsu. Qingjiangpu in northern Jiangsu is the most rampant area, and it is now invading the Jiangnan region. The most effective drug is an antimony compound, especially pentavalent antimony compounds. It is noted that there is an urgent demand for this type of antimony preparation for treating Kala-Azar. However, few manufacturers in China produce it, so it is not only expensive but also difficult to obtain. It is now known that the organic synthetic drug research department of the Shanghai Wu Zhou Pharmacy No. 1 Factory has been systematically working on these types of antimony preparations (especially pentavalent antimony compounds) for a long time. Recently, they have begun manufacturing diethylamine para-aminophenyl stibonate. Samples have been sent to drug experts for testing. In the future, meeting the needs of society will not only be related to the national economy but also to the health of the nation, which should not be underestimated.</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the Contract Dispute Case After Bai Yushuang's Disappearance</h3>
<p>Failed Out-of-Court Settlement; Court to Announce Verdict on the 12th</p>
<p>Bai Yushuang, also known as Li Guizhen, a 25-year-old female performer of Hebei Pingju Bangbang opera residing at No. 1 Jian'an Lane, Route Cardinal Foch and performing at the Empire Theater, No. 85 Avenue Joffre, suddenly disappeared on February 4th of this year after being constrained by her family and experiencing heartbreak. Bai was performing at the Empire Theater under a contract signed by Zhang Juchuan, manager of the Tongyi Company of the Empire Theater, and Xu Peigen, head of the Hebei Pingju Troupe.</p>
<p>After Bai's disappearance, Zhang Juchuan immediately approached Xu Peigen to negotiate compensation for damages. Because Xu was in Hankou and Bai's mother was searching for Bai's whereabouts, negotiations were repeatedly delayed. Zhang Juchuan then hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the Special Court No. 2's Civil Division against Xu Peigen and Bai's brother, Li Guozhang, seeking damages. The lawsuit had five points, requesting the court to order the defendants to</p>
<p>compensate for breach of contract the sum of 5,000 yuan to the Empire Theater for losses incurred since Bai's disappearance, with the defendants bearing the litigation costs. The lawsuit also requested that if the first defendant could not pay, the second defendant would be responsible for compensation, and requested a provisional execution order. Judge Wu Xiaoke had already held a hearing and postponed the matter. It was reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the two parties</p>
<p>failed to reach a settlement outside of court. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held, with both parties represented by lawyers. First, the plaintiff briefly stated the purpose of the lawsuit and claimed that the expenses of the Empire Theater were 90 yuan per day. Based on past business, a monthly profit of 3,000 yuan could be calculated. Based on the two-month remaining term of the contract, the loss would be 6,000 yuan. Furthermore, the contract stipulated that</p>
<p>if either party breached the contract, they would compensate the other party for breach of contract losses of 5,000 yuan. Now, the disappearance of Bai Yushuang was at fault, and the defendants should bear the responsibility. As for the out-of-court negotiations with the defendant's lawyer, the first defendant offered to compensate the plaintiff for losses of 2,400 yuan, but because it had to be paid in installments, the plaintiff did not accept it due to the large amount of damage. Therefore, they requested that the hearing continue today.</p>
<p>to render judgment and submitted several newspapers with advertisements for the disappearance of Bai Yushuang, saying that the news of Bai Yushuang's disappearance in the newspapers was solid proof that society was paying attention to Bai Yushuang. Xu Peigen entrusting a lawyer to publish a warning to Bai Yushuang in the newspapers also repeatedly mentioned the huge losses. Therefore, all the losses do not need to be argued by the plaintiff, so the plaintiff's request today</p>
<p>for compensation for losses is not excessive. Next, Xu Peigen's lawyer argued that the contract between the Empire Theater and the Hebei Pingju Troupe was not signed with Xu Peigen or Bai Yushuang individually. If Bai was normally ill and unable to perform, someone would replace her, and the responsibility should be borne by all the members of the Hebei Pingju Troupe. Individual actions do not affect the contract. Moreover, the Empire Theater still opened and</p>
<p>sold tickets as usual, which proves that it has nothing to do with the defendant. On the contrary, the defendant was also passive, so how could they be held responsible for others? They requested the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit. The second defendant Li Guozhang's lawyer argued that Li Guozhang was responsible for guaranteeing Xu's contract when Xu Peigen and Bai Yushuang signed the performance contract on December 5, 1935. Xu's guarantor was Zhang Weitao, and the witness was Wang Yicheng. Bai Yushuang</p>
<p>received 40% of the income from performing at the Empire Theater every day. This is a fact, but it has nothing to do with the contract signed with the Empire Theater. The Hebei Pingju Troupe paid the expenses, so they requested the dismissal of the plaintiff's lawsuit. The plaintiff's lawyer added that the main person in the Hebei Pingju Troupe was Bai Yushuang alone. For example, Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu, the leading actors at the Golden Grand Theater, only have one, and the supporting roles are not included. Therefore, Bai Yushuang's disappearance has completely disintegrated the Hebei Pingju Troupe. Judge Wu Xiaoke verified the situation, ordered a debate to be held, and then announced the adjournment of the hearing and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Tragedy Occurs in a Triad Melee</h3>
<p>Chen Xiaoheizi Dies from Severe Injuries, Zhan Guanying Wounded and Sent to Hospital</p>
<p>At 9:50 p.m. the night before last, a mass brawl occurred near Milner Road on Haining Road. As a result, Chen Xiaoheizi, also known as Chen Fuqing, a 19-year-old Guangdong native, was stabbed in the chest and died. Feng Qibai and Bai Mingfu, Chinese detectives from the Hongkou Police Station, along with Western police officers, rushed to the scene and arrested seven suspects: Chen Yousheng from Jiangxi, Zhan Guanying, Li Guoxiang, Huo Yulin, and Cai Huazai from Guangdong, and Zhang Axiang and Zhu Tingfang from Ningbo.</p>
<p>They found a large knife, two small bayonets, and two axes on the ground and took them to the police station. Zhan Guanying was wounded and sent to the police hospital for treatment. Chen Xiaoheizi's body was taken to the forensic station on Feren Road for examination. Yesterday morning, the police sent Chen Yousheng and the other six to the Criminal Division 3 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the deceased</p>
<p>Chen Xiaoheizi was a member of the Qunyi Erhehui triad at No. 30 Shishan Lane, Seward Road. The seventh defendant, Yi Huazai, is also a member of the same triad. The defendants Chen Yousheng and the other six are members of the Yinglian Triad at No. 9 Jishan Lane, Qiujiang Road, Zhabei. The cause of the incident was that a few days ago, the defendant Chen Yousheng, accompanied by a friend named Ali, went to the brothel established by the procuress Wang Zhang at No. 5 Jiuxin Lane, Feren Road.</p>
<p>The defendant Cai Huazai also argued with the prostitute A Tang for owing him one yuan. Ali intervened to help A Tang, and Cai was unhappy and felt he lost face. He then invited friends named Xi Niu and A Fang to make trouble for Ali, which eventually led to dozens of people from both sides fighting at the place. Chen Xiaoheizi died from his injuries. When the Western police officer saw him</p>
<p>lying on the ground with a knife in his hand, he drew his service pistol to deter them. The fighters scattered like birds and beasts. The police arrested the defendant Chen Yousheng, who also had knife wounds on his face and a large knife and bayonet beside his feet. The other five, Zhan Guanying, Zhang Axiang, Zhu Tingfang, Li Guoxiang, and Huo Yulin, were arrested at the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road. Cai Hua was arrested at the Qunyi Association. This case should be</p>
<p>investigated in detail at a later date. Next, Chinese and Western detectives reported the process of arresting the defendants and presented the weapons for inspection. Judge Xiao Bianfen questioned the defendants, but their statements were vague. He ordered them to be detained and the case to be re-examined at a later date. Prosecutor Zhu Genshan arrived at the forensic station to examine Chen Xiaoheizi's body and confirmed that he died from stab wounds sustained before death. The body was handed over to his mother, Chen He, for burial after she signed a guarantee.</p>

<h3>Tolstoy's Classic "Resurrection" Premieres Today</h3>
<p>Leading Actress Hu Ping Injured During Rehearsal Yesterday, But Can Still Perform Today</p>
<p>The New Southern Drama Society's production of the five-act play "Resurrection," based on the world-shaking masterpiece by Russian literary giant Tolstoy, was adapted by the famous playwright Tian Han. The play has been performed in Tokyo and Nanjing, Japan, and the box office success broke local records for drama performances. This time, the New Southern Drama Society is premiering it in Shanghai, with most of the actors from the Nanjing performance reprising their roles. The directors are Ying Yunwei and Ling He. The cast numbers as many as one hundred people, and the grandeur of the scene and the magnificence of the spirit are unprecedented in the drama world. The play rehearsed expertly yesterday and will be staged today. The final formal rehearsal was held at the society's location on Avenue Joffre, with practice in the fifth act, "The Vast Siberia," for the chorus of prisoners' songs. Due to the large number of actors, during the exit after the rehearsal, Ms. Hu Ping, the leading actress of the play, suddenly lost her footing and fell down the stairs. Ms. Hu was already tired from the rehearsal and was even more frightened by the incident. She fainted for a moment and was taken to the hospital. After a doctor's examination, it was said that there was only a very minor skin injury on her head, which would not cause any problems. The fainting was caused by mental fatigue. Therefore, "Resurrection" will begin its performance at the Carlton Theater today, and Ms. Hu can still perform. It is said that the Shanghai Drama Group's performance of "Resurrection" is one of the grandest and most lively. Drama enthusiasts should not miss the opportunity.</p>
<h3>Burglary at Zhou Fugui's Home Was Due to Tip-Off from an Old Neighbor</h3>
<p>Eight Male and Female Burglars Arrested; Firearms, Stolen Goods, and Pawn Tickets Seized</p>
<p>Zhou Fugui, a Ningbo native who runs a cloth business at No. 3 Liushen Village, Chujia Bridge, Min Ti Ni Yin Road, French Concession, was suddenly broken into by armed robbers at 11:00 a.m. on the 15th of last month. Gold jewelry, diamond rings, and cash worth more than 3,000 yuan were stolen. After reporting the incident to the police, it was found that Cai Xu (31 years old, Ningbo native, residing at No. 20 Bing'an Lane, Ailege Road, three-story building), a female neighbor from eight or nine years ago, had visited Zhou's home the day before the robbery.</p>
<p>She went straight to the third floor and inquired with Zhou's elderly mother about how many families lived together. She left after a short while. She was considered to have a possible connection to the crime. After the detectives began investigating, at 6:00 a.m. on the 4th, inspectors Jiang Futian, detectives Zhang Daorong, Zhou Bingcheng, Shen Jintao, Dai Rongji, and Bu Zhenglong from the French Concession Police rushed to No. 20 Bing'an Lane, Ailege Road, and arrested Cai Xu</p>
<p>and her lover, Song Hongsen (31 years old, Hubei native, nicknamed "Little Hubei"). After interrogation, she confessed to providing information and revealed her accomplices: Gu Shihua (36 years old, Lianshui native, residing at No. 26, Lane 929, Youheng Road) and Li Wancai (25 years old, Yangzhou native, address unknown). They had agreed to meet at the intersection of Youheng Road and Zhoushan Road at 10:00 a.m. today because an accomplice named Feng had been arrested by the Public Concession Police and sent to the First Special District Court to</p>
<p>seek legal assistance. The detectives then took Xu to the trolley station on Youheng Road and Zhoushan Road, together with detectives sent by the Public Concession Police. They waited until 10:00 a.m. and arrested Gu Shihua and Li Wancai when they arrived. They then went to Gu's home and arrested Gu's lover, Gu Li (28 years old, Jiangbei native). According to Li, there was a handgun hidden at the residence of her fellow villager, Wang Yonggao, in a bungalow at No. 11, Lane 127, Laolushenfu Road. The detectives then rushed to</p>
<p>Laolushenfu Road and arrested Wang Yonggao. According to Wang, the handgun was hidden in a box on the mezzanine floor of the Tiantaiheng Customs Brokerage at No. 77 Jiaotong Road, Public Concession. The detectives, together with the Public Concession Police, went to the Tiantaiheng Customs Brokerage and recovered a box cannon, ten bullets, and seven pawn tickets. The detectives</p>
<p>also apprehended Li Wancai's lovers, Ding Zhang and Wang Yonglan, at the residences of Cai Xu and Gu Shihua, respectively. In total, eight male and female criminals were apprehended and taken back to the police station. Based on the seven pawn tickets seized, they recovered a portion of the stolen goods from the Zhou family. Yesterday, they were sent to the Second Special District Court, where Criminal Division Chief Liao 𡎑 presided over the interrogation at the Criminal Division 1. Police Attorney Gu Shouxi explained the case and requested</p>
<p>an adjournment for further investigation and the transfer of accomplices from the First Special District Court for prosecution. Next, detectives reported the process of solving the case. Under interrogation, Gu Shihua confessed: "I did not participate in the robbery. Zhang Xiaokui, i.e. Zhang, Li Dacheng, Wang, Chen, Feng, and others went to rob. Afterwards, I received 60 yuan and they borrowed a handgun from me." Li Wancai confessed: "At the time, I</p>
<p>was sick in the inn. I knew about the case and received 34 yuan." Cai Xu confessed: "I unintentionally mentioned that my former neighbors used to be poor but are now doing better. I didn't know they would go and rob. Afterwards, they called me to the inn and gave me 100 yuan, then took back 30 yuan. I really only received 70 yuan." Gu Li and Wang Yonggao admitted to going together but said they didn't know about the robbery and didn't receive any money. The other defendants all said they didn't know about the robbery. After verifying the confessions in court, the judge adjourned the hearing until 1:00 p.m. on the 21st and ordered the defendants to be detained.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Bureau Reduces Electricity Prices in Pudong</h3>
<p>The price of electricity for lighting at the Pudong Electricity Company in this city has always been higher than in Nanshi and Zhabei. In order to reduce the burden on Pudong citizens, the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau ordered the company to reduce the price of electricity for lighting by one cent per unit from January of this year, i.e., 19 cents per unit (compared to 18 cents per unit in Nanshi and Zhabei). It is reported that the company has delayed complying with this order. Recently, the bureau has again issued an order urging the company to comply.</p>
<h3>A Lawyer Implicated by a Lawyer: Indecency Case Turns into Illegal Detention</h3>
<p>Insufficient Evidence, Jia Yi Not Prosecuted; Ding Xudong Charged with Accepting a Note</p>
<p>Lawyer Jia Yi, whose style name is Yunbiao, was sued in the District Court last month by a Suzhou woman, Zhang Suzhen, for indecency, claiming that she was defiled by Jia. Jia, on the other hand, claimed that the woman colluded with lawyer Ding Xudong and others at the Southeast Inn to</p>
<p>use the "honey trap" method to force him to sign a settlement agreement for 280 yuan. He also filed a complaint with the District Court Procuratorate, accusing Zhang Suzhen, Chen Changchun, Ding Xudong, and others of illegal detention. The case has been investigated by Prosecutor Jiang Yuanliang, who believes that the evidence in Zhang Suzhen's lawsuit against Jia Yi for indecency is insufficient and ordered that it not be prosecuted. Regarding Zhang Suzhen, Chen Changchun, Ding Xudong, and others, it is believed that the</p>
<p>crime is serious and a public prosecution has been filed. The following is the original text of Prosecutor Jiang's indictment: Defendant Zhang Suzhen, female, 24 years old, Suzhou native, residing at No. 315 Xinjiang Road, Zhabei; Chen Changchun is at large; Ding Xudong, male, 41 years old, Yangzhou native, residing at No. 10 Tongan Lane, Xinzha Road, lawyer; The right defendants' case of illegal detention, No. 9181 in the 25th year of the Republic of China, has been investigated by this prosecutor and it is believed that a</p>
<p>public prosecution should be filed. The facts of the defendants' crime, the evidence, and the applicable laws are listed below. Facts of the crime: The defendant Zhang Suzhen previously engaged Jia Yi as a lawyer to represent her in a lawsuit with Chen Fengtai, but the case was lost. Zhang Suzhen held a grudge and lured Jia Yi to the Southeast Inn at 8:00 p.m. on January 30th to commit adultery. At the same time, she colluded with the defendants Chen Changchun and Ding Xudong to coerce Jia Yi into signing a note for 280 yuan for living expenses and a document to terminate their cohabitation relationship. Jia Yi also had to give Ding Xudong a note before Jia Yi was released from the inn. Jia Yi sent a letter to Ding Xudong denying the validity of the note. Zhang Suzhen then filed a complaint alleging indecency, which was dismissed. Later, Jia Yi filed a lawsuit, providing evidence and citing the applicable laws. According to the statement of the co-defendant Ding Xudong, on January 30th,</p>
<p>after receiving a phone call, he went to the Southeast Inn and saw Zhang Suzhen, Chen Changchun, and one other unidentified person, a total of three people, at the scene. Zhang Suzhen was holding Jia Yi's pants and forcing Jia Yi to sign a note for money. Jia Yi was only released after the note was signed. It is clear that Zhang Suzhen and Chen Changchun used coercion to force Jia Yi to do something he had no obligation to do. As for the defendant Ding Xudong, as a lawyer, knowing that Jia Yi was in a state of coercion, he still helped Zhang Suzhen force Jia Yi to sign a note and accepted the note issued by Jia Yi.</p>
<p>It is also very clear that he helped Zhang Suzhen to illegally detain Jia Yi. Except for Zhang Suzhen's complaint against Jia Yi for indecency, which is invalid due to lack of legal authority and insufficient evidence, the defendants are all guilty of the crime in Article 304, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, a prosecution is filed in accordance with Articles 230, Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law.</p>

<p>Outside the Kunshan West Gate of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Kunshan Station, there has long been a large farm with various incomes from fish farming, bamboo planting, tree planting, peach and fruit trees, and rice and wheat. It was established in the third year of the Republic of China but failed due to poor management. It was mortgaged to a certain bank for a large sum of money, and it has not been settled for several years. The owner of the farm now intends to transfer this farm to others. Through introductions, several people from the legal community, together with people from the academic community, plan to reorganize the company and redeem this property from a certain bank. They will then select specialized personnel to manage and improve various aspects, such as fish farming, chicken raising, and peach and fruit planting. A plan has already been discussed. Roughly, in addition to the founders subscribing to half of the shares, the remaining amount will be negotiated with various sectors to issue new shares.</p>

<h3>Watching a Pudong Temple Fair, Wife Angered by Husband, Throws Herself into the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>Hou Fujin, a Chongming native living at No. 21 Guanglinli, Longjiang Road, Yangshupu, has been unemployed for a long time and lives in poverty. His wife, Ms. Xu, is only 23 years old and quite beautiful. She works as a female worker in the cloth weaving room of the Shenxin No. 6 Yarn Factory there, relying on it to support the family. On the 4th of this month, during the Pudong Doutian Great Emperor's tour and temple fair, Ms. Xu was invited by female coworkers from the factory to watch the event in Pudong. She did not go to work in the factory all day. When she returned home late in the evening, her husband blamed her for not working during such difficult times. Ms. Xu was narrow-minded and retorted, and a quarrel ensued. Unexpectedly, Ms. Xu became extremely angry and suddenly had a pessimistic thought. Yesterday morning at 6:00 AM, she pretended to go to work at the factory, walked alone to the Qiwupu Road Wharf, and threw herself into the Huangpu River. Fortunately, Hua Police No. 45 of the water patrol station saw her and rescued her, taking her back to the police station. After questioning, it was found that the situation was extremely tragic. Hua Detective Yao Guofa was sent to summon her husband and advised him that his wife bore the heavy burden of supporting the family. He told him not to make a big deal of a small thing and be too calculating, as it almost caused a tragedy. Hou obediently listened and took his wife home.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Deceased Ex-Wife's Daughter Confirmed by Court Examination</h3>
<p>Jiang Shouting, a Tianjin native, is 40 years old and currently serves as a Guademas, a steersman on the Taikoo Company's Guangzhou steamer. His ex-wife had three daughters and one son.

Therefore, he remarried Ms. Xing (42 years old), a fellow villager, the year before last. The family rents a house at No. 7 Hederli, Diandang Lane, Lanyi Ferry Road, Pudong. Jiang only returns home once a month. His first daughter, Wanxiao, is 15 years old this year and has a history of lung disease. She suddenly died at 4:00 AM yesterday without seeing a doctor. Neighbors were suspicious and speculated, saying that Ms. Xing had abused her to death. The patrol police heard about it and reported it to the branch director, Zhang. He instructed the local Baochang, Lu Shunlong, to report to the local court. At 4:00 PM, the court dispatched Prosecutor Lei and Clerk Chen to the scene. It was found that the young daughter, Wanxiao, had two old bruises on her right face and left arm. It was determined that she died from illness after the injury, and an order was issued for her burial. The police station will send Ms. Xing to the case for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Yong'an Cemetery Theft of Bronze Cauldron in Front of Wang's Mother's Tomb Solved</h3>

<h3>"Safety Measures"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Mei</p>
<p>Since the customs anti-smuggling personnel were beaten and injured by Japanese thugs, the question of "how to prevent smuggling" has been raised. But before long, the injured and the follow-up of the anti-smuggling methods have gradually disappeared from the indifference. Occasionally, in the corners of newspapers, one can still see news with very little space, such as "a large number of copper coins seized" and "copper coins smuggled out," which tells readers that the smuggling trend in Shanghai has not disappeared. Implicitly, it also serves to explain to the customs authorities: they have fulfilled some responsibilities, achieved some "victories," and seized some copper coins.</p>
<p>When the arrogance of the thugs not only did not decrease slightly, but also intensified after the anti-smuggling personnel were injured, our courteous customs bureau invented the so-called "safety measures" and the "obedience" sign that "must not be implemented without the command of superiors, causing various disputes."</p>
<p>Sure enough, the "safety measures" seem to have had "great gains" from today's news. According to reports: (The Japanese ship Maya Maru, which was docked at the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's wharf, had 50 thugs wearing specially-made thick cloth jackets smuggling copper coins again at midnight the day before yesterday. They only finished loading around 2:00 AM. At that time, the customs had received a secret report, but in order to prevent accidents, they did not send personnel to intercept them. After the thugs finished loading, they all left the ship, leaving only a few people to guard it. It was not until 4:00 AM yesterday that the customs sent personnel to board the ship to implement the anti-smuggling inspection. They seized more than 100,000 copper coins (worth about 400 yuan) and nine smuggled jackets on the ship. They were packed into sacks and safely transported to the customs by car, and all were confiscated. This is the second major gain for the customs anti-smuggling personnel since the 26th of last month."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, it has been ten days from the 26th of last month to now. Has there been no "large-scale smuggling of copper coins" during these ten days? Flipping through the old newspapers, I saw that a certain newspaper on April 4th said:</p>
<p>"At 1:00 AM on the 2nd, a large number of Japanese thugs, each holding wooden sticks and iron rulers, rushed to the Huishan Wharf, startling the tax police stationed there and prohibiting Chinese people from using the telephone at the Huishan Wharf Management Office. They then directed hooligans and traitors to carry copper coins from their bags (about 2,000 coins per bag) and board the Japanese ship Chichibu Maru. After the loading was completed, fearing that the tax police would report to the anti-smuggling section of the Jianghai Customs, they continued to send police to monitor them. It was not until 6:00 AM at dawn that the Chichibu Maru weighed anchor and left Shanghai that they roared away."</p>
<p>Following this news, there are also records of the smuggling of copper coins when the Japanese ship Tatsuta Maru left the port. The final record states: "At that time, the customs tax police on duty at the wharf saw the situation and asked the Chinese customs officers to issue an order to intercept them, but because the Chinese customs officers did not want to cause trouble, the tax police were unable to perform their duties due to customs regulations."</p>
<p>The above two news items are quite "safe." The "safety" of the former should be attributed to the thugs, while the latter should be attributed to our "unwilling to cause trouble" Chinese customs officers. However, is it precisely because of this that China's copper coins, under the protection of "safety measures," are "safely" loaded onto Japanese ships and "safely" transported to Japan?</p>
<p>Although the "safe" places are different, either on Japanese ships or at customs, it seems that there are more Japanese ships than customs, or even only Japanese ships and no customs.</p>
<h3>Han Affairs Department</h3>
<p>— Lan Pei</p>
<p>Liu Faxiang was lying on the desk, carefully copying the "Patriotic Song" on the blackboard.</p>
<p>The singing teacher pointed to the words on the blackboard with a rattan cane and read aloud:</p>
<p>"Love the country, love China, China is the home of my ancestors and fathers, China is strong and the overseas Chinese are happy, China is weak and the overseas Chinese are ashamed, perish——</p>
<p>"Sir, what is that word?" Liu Faxiang asked. "The people of a perished country are slaves——slaves to what?"</p>
