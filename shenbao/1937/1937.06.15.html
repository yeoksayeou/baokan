<h3>暑假期間對於救國最有效的工作是什麽</h3>
<p>蔣委員長發表談話</p>
<p>［九江］牯嶺電話蔣委員長為徵集暑農村服務生、十五日發表談話其願為“暑假期間對於救國最有效力的工作是什麽”、原文如次、</p>
<p>靑年學生重大責任</p>
<p>我們要救國、與復興民族、必先要提倡精神建設、恢復我們民族固有的道德、來改革過去一切自私怯懦虛偽紛亂的習慣、而成為一個互相團結忠勇整齊的民族這樣重大的工作、决非一朝一夕所能做到的、必需要長時期的努力、和百折不撓的精神才能達到我們的目的、這樣的工作•到底由誰負担起來呢、我認為這是全民族的責任、就是每一個國民都先要有這個覺悟、才能夠“羣策羣力來做成功復興民族的工作、但是要使全體國民有這樣澈底的覺悟、必須要有一班人以身作則的來做“發瞶振聾”的領導工作、這種領導羣衆的事業、是一班靑年人、尤其是一班靑年學生的重大使命、這樣重大的責任、靑年們是義不容辭、而且是無可推諉的工作、總理說“人生以服務為目的、不以奪取為目的、”靑年在學校裏讀書的時候、是分利的時期、如果他們祇知道分利、而不知道如何準備將來生產、那簡直是養成社會的蠢虫、所以今日中國的大中學生、在求學時代、第一必須建立一個正確的人生觀、第二必須認識中國社會實際生活及其病態與缺點、來盡心盡力的研究、第三必須利用餘暇、來學習生產技能和改造社會建設農村的工作、新生活運動總會所提倡的“學生暑期農村服務”的意義、就是要使我們全國學生們、共同奮興起來、負担這個復與民族的責任、我們當然很明瞭學生們在暑期中所做的服務工作不多、但這是學生們精神建設的濫觴</p>
<p>偉大前進的發轉、猶如久經嚴霜後春機的發動、靑年人的人生觀漸漸呈現着積極的趨向、知道社會的實况、民間的痛苦、物力的艱難、明瞭服務人生的天職、這又是多麽可貴的消息呢、</p>
<p>救國工作服務農村</p>
<p>談到建設事業、中國到處都有迫切的需要、我們因物質文明非常落伍、所以必須要迎頭趕上、才能與列強各國并駕齊驅、看到近年來我們各種建設事業、亦有相當的成績、但是如果走到農村去看一看、我們便可明瞭農村經濟是怎樣破產、農民生活是怎樣困苦、我們的農村和農民生活、如果一天不改善、我們的革命、我們復興民族的工作、便一天不能算完成、所以農村的建設、是各種建設事業中之最重要的基礎、我們應當認識農村服務是做建設事業的出發點、有人如果認為靑年在求學時代、除讀書外無法可以救國、這更是一種極大的錯誤、要知道救國有各種方法、最緊要的是各人能盡各人的本分、各人能利用各人的時間、不使虛度一分、各人能認淸各人的目標向前直上、換句話說、各人能把各人的才能、盡量的貢獻到社會和民衆之中、這就是救國的要義、譬如學生們如果肯利用餘暇到農村去服務埋頭苦幹那才是眞正的救國工作、况且現在國際風雲日惡、人民的生計日促、我們如果再要像從前那樣因循下去、失掉時機恐怕要後悔莫及了復興工作是要從“大處着眼、小處着手”各位不要認為農村服務的工作事情很細碎很困難但是我們實施服務的意義是很深長偉大、我相信靑年都是最有志氣和血性的人、到了相當時期、一定能夠及時奮發、凡是能夠到鄉下去服務的人、一定是有志氣的靑年、凡是能夠犧牲個人的安樂而去助人的人、必定是有血性的第一等人格、他們並不是為名或是為利、他們是為要做復與民族的基本工作、這種經過實地練習的學生、將來畢業以後到社會上去、一定認識社會上實際情形得到無數經騐、能夠和惡勢力爭鬭、不會隨波逐流的腐敗下去、中國要多產生這種學生、才能有辦法、敎育當局、要能敎養出這種學生、才能算在敎育上沒有失敗、這是我們提倡學生到農村去服務的意義、（未完）</p>

<h3>時評</h3>
<h3>開發西南與完成湘黔鐵路</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>自京滇週覽團完成了數萬里旅程後。國人的注意力。集中於西南開發問題。而貴州與東南各省交通聯絡。更為談經濟開發與國防建設者注意之焦點。本月十日。有京黔長途電話的正式開始通話。京黔二處。可以晤談於一室。據本月八日的中央社電訊。聯絡湖南株州與貴州貴陽的湘黔鐵路。决定於本年秋間興工。鐵道部已有命令限在民國二十九年底完成。而由貴陽北通成都與西達昆明的川黔川滇二鐵路。亦測量完畢將繼續興工這條橫貫全國的大動脈完成。不但對於政治的統一與資源的開發。可以收偉大效果對於樹立國防。建設復興民族之根據地。更有重要之意義與價值。</p>
<p>湘黔鐵路。為“蔣委員長五年鐵路計畫中最重要的幹綫。據鐵道部長張家璈的談話。五年計畫。包括十四條新鐵路。共八千一百四十公里。湘黔路綫。由株州•湘潭•新化•辰谿•芷江•玉屏•靑谿•龍里到貴陽。達一千公里。除百分之五。是平原地帶外。百分九十五經過崇山峻嶺。工程艱難。倍於平綏粵漢成渝等路其中在湘省境內一段為蔣委員長親自指定在黔省一段。則與此次週覽團所取之路綫相符合。在經濟方面。這條路綫附近。有銻鎢錫煤鐵水銀等礦產。有森林棉茶麻烟草等農產。豐富的天然資源有待開發在交通方面。這條路是打通東南與西南的唯一捷徑。東與萍株玉萍浙贛鐵路相接。直達京滬。與粵漢相接。則可以達兩廣及長江流域。他日黔滇完成。與滇城鐵路相啣拉。則上海與安南間。可以不假海道而得聯絡了。</p>
<p>然而湘黔鐵路的重要性。與其說是經濟的。不如說是政治的與國防的。像本月十日何應欽部長所說“因為利用交通工具。中央與地方政情。聯絡更密切。”事實的政治統一。要用交通建設來推進。近年來政府對於西南交通網的努力。和航空綫公路網之開闢。不可不謂積極。而他的效果。在政治上已有顯明的表示。在國防方面。因為西南是我們民族復興根據地。他不但有富饒的礦產。得地理上的優勢。而且接近印度洋的海口。假使昆明與緬甸間有鐵路聯絡。則太平洋與印度洋交通。可以縮短時間。而萬一太平洋岸發生戰事。我們治江沿海各省門戶洞開。難於防守。不幸而退守西南。亦可以得到通國際海口的路綫。所以有人稱湘黔及黔滇路綫為“中華民族最後生命綫。”並不楚誇大的說法。</p>
<p>在近七八年以來政府從事於國防建設所得的經騐很淸楚的昭示着第一。選擇民族最後根據地。東南不如西北。西北不及西南。因為西北旣無海口。又沒有充份的糧食及其他資源所以雲貴兩廣是我們最後的基地第二使根據地興沿海沿江各省取得聯絡公路與航空綫不能代替着鐵路因為就運輸原理說。公路只宣於短距離的交通。數量小的貨物之遞送。航空僅宜於高貴物品之迅速遞送。論到任重致遠迅速安全以鐵路為最佳而鐵道更利於軍事的運輸。蘇聯的遠東國防建設。首先注意於西伯利亞鐵路雙軌之敷設。日本在黑龍江前綫。亦亟而於造鐵路。其動機並無二致。</p>
<p>所以西南鐵路網之建設實為民族復興的基礎工作而湘黔鐵路則為此鐵路網的主脈由京滇週覽團各團員的報告我們知道西南公路情形目前還不能適應國防的要求我們希望湘黔路能及早完成在西南的巍巍萬山中。替中華民族打出一條生路來。</p>

<p>王延松詞</p>
<p>中央、民訓部陳部長代表王延松致詞云、主席、諸位先生、今天兄弟代表中央民訓部陳部長、得參加貴會十週紀念大會覺得非常榮幸、陳部長過去長實業部的時候對於貴會員事業的發展、非常關心、現在擔任民訓部長、不但對於貴會會員事業、仍是很關心、並且對於貴會組織的健全更是懸念、所以陳部長很想親自來參加、只因公務實在太忙、沒有方法抽身、因此特地囑兄弟代表參加、來說幾句話、一個國家的機輪、要使牠健全、必須要使各種力量部能平均的發展、然後能產生整個國家的力量、而這個國家、方可稱之謂現代的國家、所謂各種力量、就是指國家生存的各種條件的力量而言譬如軍事的力量、政治的力量、文化的力量乃至一切農工商礦經濟的力量、如果這許多的力量、都能平均發展起來、那末國家的力量便產生了、而後國家可以富強、我國現在國勢如是薄弱、受盡强鄰的壓迫和欺侮、這就是因為我們各種力量都不能發達的緣故、所以我們今後應該向增強各種力量這條路上去努力邁進、尤其是經濟方面、中國因工業落後、工業界所負的責任、是更為重大、希望貴會諸君、秉過去十餘年來堅毅的精神、對國家對民族更有偉大的貢獻、一方政府應盡力保護工業界、指導工業界、而工業對於本身應該努力的地方很多、譬如組織上、管理上、技術上等等、都應繼續不斷的求改進、那末工業界的力量、便一天增強一天、對於國家民族的貢獻也一天大一天、今天謹代表陳部長、在這裏祝頌各位遠大的成功、為我國工業界闢光明的大道、末了、兄弟個人還有一點意見貢獻、就是此次參加京滇公路週覽會、經過蘇皖贛桂川黔滇八省、見到內地可以做的事業太多了、尤其內地的工業、已在萌芽時期、需要工業界去開發、這個不但對於國家社會、應該如此、卽為工業界自身謀出路、也應該如此的、希望諸位莫放棄了這個責任、也就是說莫被棄這個機會、才是、</p>
<p>程次長詞</p>
<p>實業部程次長天固致詞略謂今天來參加貴會十週紀念大會、兄弟很覺榮幸、記得在湖南參觀展覽會時、就感想到機製品的重要、中國一向是以農立國的國家、對於工業製造、向來不注意的、四萬萬的人口、就有三萬萬佔着農的地位、但在二十世紀的時代、並不是以農可以立國的、一定要參於工業、農業固然需要但工業也是需要的農工業初發展、要求其平衡、中國近年來由於一般人的提倡、工業已漸漸地發展起來了、中央對於國貨工廠的稅收、也酌量减輕、政府屬指導地位、民衆屬合作地位、然後可使工業進步、有一般投機份子、天天賣空買空、不將精神物質用於正當事業與福利上去、這種是最可痛恨的、現在我國已走上復興之道、政府極力提倡國民經濟建設、目前工業雖少有發展、今後必須與政府合作、然後可以有更大的成績、增加生產品、就是充實國力、希望貴會繼續不斷的努力、俾得人民完全用國貨</p>

<h3>人物小誌</h3>
<p>— 漁龍</p>
<p>記鄧廷楨</p>
<p>鴉片一役，大家知道有一位閩人林則徐，郤忘記江蘇先賢中，尚有一位鄧廷楨。按上年各省選定先賢，江蘇計四十位，鄧卽其中之一人。</p>
<p>鄧為江蘇寗（現京市）人，嘉慶年進士，歷官兩廣，閩浙總督，甘陝巡撫：常督兩廣時，正值禁烟，曾與英人接戰六次，英船都受傷退去，終其任，英船不得入虎門。後亦與林則徐全受謫戍伊犂的處分。</p>
<p>鄧精於政治，專研究古音，著有詩雙聲聲韻譜，及說文解字雙聲疊韻譜。亦好填詞，有一雙研齋詞”刋行，多忠誠悱惻，憂生傷亂之語。（白虹）</p>
<h3>不洗臉主義</h3>
<p>— 月湖花隱</p>
<p>東三省義勇軍名將趙尚志將軍，足智多謀，勇敢善戰，頗為上峯所器重。趙氏自東北淪亡後，痛河山之變色，國難之嚴重，除督率健兒，與敵作殊死戰外，並抱定“不洗臉”主義。自東省被陷後，迄未洗臉，立誓必俟失土收復，方肯洗臉。並且說：“中國人的臉丟完了，還要洗什麽臉呢？”我們聽了趙將軍這一席話，該怎樣去努力呵！</p>
<h3>汪精衛的演說</h3>
<p>— 焦士潔</p>
<p>中政會主席汪精衛先生，是一個非常善於演說的人，在他演說的時候，固然可以全塲肅然靜聽，卽使是同他談話時，聽到他那番高論，也是從來沒有不點頭稱是的。</p>
<p>汪先生在演說的時候，有一種特別的習慣，這習慣可以說任何人所沒有的。大概汪先生說得太出神入化了，所以不要說是聽的人聽了出神，汪先生自己說的人也說得忘形，在汪先生說得激昂慷慨的時候，他常會把右手的大拇指，在左掌心上擦着，說得愈憤慨，摩擦得也愈有勁，話說得愈高，摩擦得愈有力，所以在一次盛大的開會，汪先生演說下來，他的掌心總已擦得紅紅的，熱辣辣地。</p>
<p>這是汪先生演說時特別的地方，大概也就是旁人所及不上的地方。</p>
<p>汪先生的口才，文才，和記憶力，都有特賦的聰明，每在重要演說完了之後，許多新聞記者都托汪先生自己做一篇演說辭，不用說這演說辭是做得異常流利，而且同他自己演說的次序字句完全一樣，更可以在最迅速的時間內寫將出來。</p>
<h3>李鴻章與修足匠</h3>
<p>— 張國權</p>
<p>清廷爵相李鴻章，掌北洋銷鑰十餘年，功高望重，煊赫一時。迨甲午事發後，朝野交疵，威望稍捐，然清政府仍極倚重之。李氏旣卸任直隸總督，一時無可位置；時盛倡聯俄之策，西后乃命其報聘各國，藉覘鄰意。李氏銜命抵滬，候船放洋，行轅甫定，亟令物色修足匠，（卽今之扦脚司務）蓋李氏左足足底素患胼胝，如肉刺然，深將及寸。隨侍某㒒，手術獨精，嘗為之間夕一整治，否則卽痛苦不能觸地。此次該㒒不願遠行，脫役而去，李固未便強留也。嗣探悉某浴堂某匠，奏刀最精，乃召赴行轅，發硎試之：李氏大加贊賞，卽命獎以十金，復詢其月給七十元，願隨節出洋否？匠不敢遽諾，歸商戚友，愈慫恿之，乃覆命報可。李復賞以百金，令拼擋被服及安家之需，搭輪放洋。詎料該匠自得金後，以輕離妻孥，隻身遠涉，驚悸不寐，竟成狂疾，不旬日遂殞其生。後李氏在法復以重價僱一美匠，專司“足”務，隨李左右，未嘗或離，後李氏任畢回國，該美匠亦隨與俱來云。</p>
<h3>李大超的攘夷</h3>
<p>— 縱橫</p>
<p>吳鐵城任上海市長的時候，市政府裏有一位長袖善舞的科長李大超，他可算得吳氏的重要幫手，這在看報的人，大概都知道的，聽說李氏自署他的書齋呌“攘夷室。”攘夷二字，在這個年頭，自然十分時髦，大家都以為李氏的這個自署，一定寓有時代的意義，誰知李氏他還有另外的一重意義呢。</p>
<p>原來李氏的夫人王女士是立法院的前任委員，伊跟李氏是非常親愛的，而李氏的對於伊亦相敬如賓，據說，每次當王女士從南京開了會回來，李氏一定到車站迎候，然後再一道返家，這可以說是風雨不爽的，同時李氏因為的確是十分的愛他的夫人，所以把書齋題了一個攘夷的名稱。</p>
<p>這話怎樣講呢？你們想想看：攘夷二字的上面，不是還有“尊王一二個字嗎？尊王作什麽解，也可以不言而喻了，妙語雙關，這是李氏故意弄的玄虛，我們從這一點上，也可以看出李氏的聰明來了。</p>
<h3>崑山民族英雄</h3>
<p>— 美人香草齋</p>
<p>吾國國勢素弱，外侮頻仍，濱海各地，時遭侵略，民族英雄迭載史乘。崑山西郊朝陽門外，有故唐代卜將軍廟在焉；屋宇軒暢，威靈顯著，香火甚盛，殿後有塚，卽一代民族英雄卜將軍之長眠地也。墓以崑山白石砌成，為長方形，圍以六角形水泥墓道，四週廣植松柏，墓前設有饗台翁仲，尤令人肅然起敬。不佞於役斯邦，公餘之暇，時往憑弔，念及國難未已，來日大難，往往泣下沾襟，茲將卜將軍事蹟介紹於右：</p>
<p>將軍姓卜，名珍，字文超，大唐西河人也，敬宗時，紀綱頹萎，藩鎮騷然，將軍奮孤忠，值唐室將隳，東征西討，雄勳盛烈，為世所推，賓歷元年四月十五日，染微恙十有六日，沐浴冠帶，奄然而逝，享年六十九歲，葬於崑山西麓。將軍累著靈蹟，正德庚午，辛未間，邑大疫，預示徵應，嘉靖甲寅，倭寇薄城下，神顯靈，斃西城賴以完，知縣祝乾壽奏入祀曲，明嘉靖三十三年四月，倭寇猝至，由三江口薄東關，…西關，城垂破，守陣者皆哭，有老父進曰：“但沸桐油，雜厠穢，從月城隙下之，賊可擒也”。如其言，果得巨魁二大王者，縛旌竿，射殺之，賊乃解圍去，乾壽循城，憇土神卜將軍祠，睨其像，卽西關老父，遂上其事，春秋祀之</p>
<p>觀上述史蹟，生前旣矢忠唐室，復興民族為己任，死後更顯靈退寇，使疆土不失，危城得全，有功於我中華民族，其功不可沒焉。月之十五日，為將軍壽誕，相沿有賽會之舉，今歲盛况，為歷年所罕有，是日萬人空巷，人山人海，蘇滬各地之來觀者，亦屬不鮮，雖跡近勞民傷財，然在此國難聲中，亦絕妙民族精神之興奮劑焉。</p>
<h3>吳佩孚將軍會見記</h3>
<p>— 劍</p>
<p>抵故都之第四日，微雨，至什錦花園，訪吳佩孚將軍。南人所得關於將軍之生活記載絕少，但知其閉戶為經，不問外事，“老去英雄惟種菜”，覺其悲涼落寞之情態，必有非斷片之文詞所能為喻者。至則甲第儼然，大樹數十章，秀出於清整嚴肅之水磨磚牆垣綫以外，門前二三甲士。撫槍睨客，殊無貧象。投片入見，先晤其副官長洪某，洪請吾人勿談政治問題，並暗示吳氏之言必不能悉中竅要。此點記者固蚤知之，興登堡晚年，英氣全盡，客與之談天下事，則支離昏瞀，幾不成詞。“時間為殘酷的”吳將軍老矣，其思想一切，不合此一時代之檢格，要無庸為諱，而其為典型之舊軍人，在中華民國雛期史上，自有其相當之地位，以氣節與人格論，彼等軍人無足與比者，吾人之所以必欲見之，半亦出於“歷史的感情”也。</p>
<p>越數分鐘，洪及吳氏之參謀長張方叢來迓，謂吳氏已候於廳事，由接待室北行，為一大院落，雜花滿樹，中有鳴禽，境頗幽豔。吳氏衣棉綢之長服，面部甚豐滿光澤，絕不似其舊日照片中之瘦峭，自座間起迎客，徐徐曰：“來已久乎？齊音而柔婉，言時微露其齒，則白數齒鑲金，粲然作光。記者簡單述明來意，吳氏持記者之名片讀之，微笑言曰：“君名慧劍，甚佳，可以擔當國事，此二字出於維摩詰經，以智慧劍破煩惱賊，今日種種煩惱，要待此劍除解”，記者以其言詭肆，知有深言，因趁勢以北方之動蕩局面將發展至何狀態為問，吳氏略一沉吟，反詰予曰：“我方著一書，君見之乎？答以未，乃呼其侍者，取來相贈，則“春秋左傳淺解”一卷，吳氏指書言曰：“可以細讀，”因略檢之，書僅一卷，為隱公四五兩年事，頗訝吳氏著書，何以僅刋此一部？殆以其中有州吁弒君及衛師人郕諸節，可供其反覆推論，發抒積郕也。吳氏本非淵於學者，其注左傳，傳會之語特多，顧謂其係影射時事而發，亦無不可，北等書，當以別一種眼光讀之，所謂含涙的微笑，不容一筆抹煞也。記者復詢以康南海追悼會，已於中山公園舉行，將軍於南海之友誼甚深，顧對太炎則何如者?吳氏答曰:”亦好友也，南海與太炎性格相似，以年齡與時代關係，致成就不同，南海年較高，出較早，為保皇黨之魁率，太炎年差幼，才氣橫溢，非南海以下之空間所能容，遂激而入革命，使兩人易地相處，南海可為太炎，太炎亦可為南海也。”言至此，吳氏慨然，以為“兩人逝後，國中不復有文學之士，兩人之弟子雖多，乃無足承其業者，”記者欲試探其對於新文學之見解，因語之曰：太炎有弟子周樹人，筆名魯迅，文學優美，君嘗讀其書乎？”吳氏意頗恍惚，若不知其名者，索筆書魯迅兩字示之，吳益瞢然，旣乃自掩曰：“我不讀民國以來書，故不知其人也。”記者挑以語曰：“將軍忘五四運動乎。此皆當年之斗士，我猶憶人及將軍被峙極同情靑年運動，今日如何？亦有接近北方靑年之意念，與感情乎？”吳氏頷首者再，吳之幕僚某君，旁坐儳言曰：“將軍對北平學生運動仍極關切，特無能為力耳，”相與一歎。同行汪鑑榮君出照相機，為吳氏攝一影，吳氏頗覺欣悅，自攝影而擴論及於三敎同源，所舉多為悟善社式之理論，吳氏之人生觀與宇宙觀，與現時代大相扞格，記者不欲筆其語，筆之亦不成體系也。</p>
<p>最後，吳氏忽與記者談及南京，謂民國十三年樓船過此，下關燈火，如在目前，但未入城耳。蓋在馮煥章回師之後，吳氏倉皇由海道南來，直隸系大勢已去，為吳氏個人歷史之一大轉灣點，後此卽為凄涼狼狽之逋客生活，故吳氏對於此時種種，記憶極為深刻。吳氏指摘南京之形勢，不宜於建都，謂“我有夏口，且不能守，何况南京，齊撫萬留我共居南京，我堅郤之，卽有見於此也。”吳氏並引章太炎輓民元烈士之聊以為證曰：“此地龍蟠虎踞，古人之虛言。”記者知其成見甚深，因復詢其有新詩否？曰：“久不事吟咏矣，邇惟闔戶著春秋左傳淺解，日成數頁，期以四十年，可完成也，”言時大笑，笑聲甚洪，若孕有無窮之生力也者。</p>
<p>記者旣辭出，更詢其私生活之情形於洪趙諸君，則曰不甚見客，曰惟著書，上午打坐後，必食蜜柑，與江朝宗等組織明經學會，自為會長，江為副會長，兩人差相得，又東北舊日之師長許蘭洲，時來訪談。問楊雲史常來否，則名義上仍為吳之祕書，特不常至耳。</p>
<p>出門，挽予來時之車夫，瘦面有髯，仍候於道旁。見記者笑曰：“吳二爺精神好？”似甚關心其健康者。北大椎魯直樸，其理想中之典型人物，仍為“吳佩孚式”的，舊都之販夫走卒，聞吳之名皆肅然，此吳氏暮年之安慰，亦卽其晚節之所以能茂也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談自殺</h3>
<p>— 沈情</p>
<p>自殺在近來似乎成了一時的風尚。打開報紙，每天差不多總可以發見這麽幾條。不說逼迫致此，（諺有云：好死不如惡活。若非逼不得已，誰又肯把生命結束呢？）或是死得不應當，更不管死的原因是為了經濟或是其他；自殺成為一種風氣，那不論於個人家庭，於國家社會，總是一筆損失，一件重大的隱憂！</p>
<p>自殺是弱者的行為，這已經聽得太多了：這些也且不去管牠。沒有遺書的不算，生前留有絕命書的，則大都有個共同的地方：希望親友或是同胞能夠奮發有為，替國家或是父母幹一番事業，揚眉吐氣。然而他自己呢，却以死來了結。細按之下，這是有些可笑的：也證實死者的懦弱：再不然，說得難聽一點，是逃避責任。固然，在死者望出來或許是漆黑一片，要“奮斗”也無從“奮斗”起，但却又明知道把漆黑換成光明，是必需要“奮鬥”的，於是就把“奮斗”寄托在別人身上，好像別人的環境就跟他不同，而要“奮斗”，也須得有良好的環境似的。</p>
<p>說句笑話，這倒有些像要游泳就得穿好游泳衣，上游泳池去才能游泳，一旦掉在海裏，就祇能以環境黑暗而讓“環境”吞噬了。自然這比喻未免有些過火，死是多重大的事情，身歷其境者的痛苦又是怎樣的深，哀悼憐惜之不遑，豈可幸災樂禍，“吃死人豆腐”？</p>
<p>然而同情死者，却還不如用更大的心力來挽救生者！</p>
<p>我們也知道“奮斗”兩字是很抽象的，整天喊着奮鬥，未必就是奮斗。而環境黑暗，總是事實，要在黑暗中求得一綫光明，東碰西撞，碰撞得頭破血流，也是常情，在黑弄堂裏自己甘願倒下去固然於已無補，於後來者也只多了絆脚石，使得留個壞印象，更使他們胆戰心驚得不敢前進。就是在倒下去的時候喊着奮鬥，希望後來者能夠越過他們的屍身，然而這微弱的呼聲於事實究竟又有何補益呢？聲音消失了，所看到的則是使人恐怖的白骨和屍身。</p>
<p>自然也不會忘記，也决不會放過造成這黑弄堂的是誰？黑弄堂又是怎樣和什麽造成的？更不祇要求在黑弄堂裏有幾盞明燈，可以讓人走走，而更主要的，則是如何設法把這漆黑一片的環境轟開，使得後來者再不會找不到燈，感到苦悶，感到黑暗而自殺。</p>
<p>而要幹這樣艱苦的工作，咬緊牙關活下去却是第一要著。一個人的力量或許不夠，集合起許多人的力量，則就可以了。再說，就是在黑弄堂裏，許多人手搶着手的前進，也總比一個人的摸索來得方便。而現在則正有許多人同樣處在漆黑一團的環境中。</p>
<h3>曙光</h3>
<p>— 方黑</p>
<p>沒有金錢，也沒有歡樂。我倒身花被褥上，蒙着頭輾轉了一夜。床頭的那隻卡字錶還軋軋的響，雖然是深夜，但牠還是伴着我，不倦地軋軋着。像一個朋友在那裏講話。我感到一種喜悅，於是便想開去。</p>
<p>孩子們的夜夢是綺麗的，那是織在彩虹和煙霞上面，紅塵起處，依稀有天。聯袂出游的踪影。只記得曾在夢裏一伸手便搖落了滿天的星點，而背胴上也曾無端地長出了芒刺。</p>
<p>我也做過這樣的夢，那却是遠在孩子的時代。現在我何嘗不憧憬着能睡在夢的底邊，只是我却多年來未曾入睡，更沒有爽朗的夢了。</p>
<p>昨夜，有同樣的孤寂，伴着我在燈下嗆嗽，十幾年來我把鼻尖深深地埋在同樣的書本裏，却永遠困頓在這空闊的夜裏，我期待着一綫曙光落在我的床前，而且篩在我的顏面上。</p>
<p>瑟瑟的窗外，柳葉在𦄵繂着裙裾的繍邊，響着少女般的無謂的噓顫。肅有月亮，沒有天，連風聲也是黑黝黝的。</p>
<p>尋出一枝烟抽着，烟圈是花白的。</p>
<p>我把期待寄在那幾顆冥冥的星點上，透過重幃，我凝視着。</p>
<p>圃裏的矮樹也許灣曲着腰枝，還晃着頭，且不勝寂寞似地。但這些在我全是漠然的，我只默對着冥冥的星點，而想起臨將遠來的曙色。</p>
<p>夜色凝重，遲疑地從西方的地平緬沒下去。夜的沾沾的霧氣瀾瀰地散開去，陰積於西方的遠處。</p>
<p>而東方的天隅上，那濛漠的樹梢，曙色熹微的光芒在窺探着茅舍的檐角和烟突了。</p>
<p>在悒鬱的屋蔭裏，有一片低低幽幽的蟲鳴，風吹唿着，空氣是鮮暢的，圈圍着的是柔美的氣氛，周遭沒有、絲機械的噪聲，逼沒有金錢和嚴權的時辰。</p>
<p>逐漸地，突破了黑暗的氛圍，曙光從舊世紀似的遠方浮泛了出來。</p>
<p>我爬下溫軟的床。東方地平綫上的大太陽滾出了半隻紅弧，漩渦似地旋轉着，有如在渾沌的宇宙裏，太古時代的地球摔散着熾烈的火花。</p>
<p>我對着東方的旭日拋開了臂膀，再合起掌來。</p>
<p>但我們的孩子連看早晨的大陽都未嫻熟呢！</p>
<h3>疑案</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>初夏之於是靜靜的，天津的海河也是靜靜的。</p>
<p>海河的對岸排列着一列近代建築物的影子，那是××紗廠及××洋行的堆棧，矗立在屋顶上的旗杆頭顶，隱約地有面破旗子在星空中飄揚着。河畔的淺灘上，空曠得一點什麽都沒，周遭是靜悄悄地，只有流水的聲音在嘶嘶地的低呌。</p>
<p>那左面的一座龍王廟角上，一盞幽點的路燈躱在一枝電桿木的中間，它彷彿是一個神經衰弱者似的，睜着那失眼的眼睛，照在那個泥灘上，使那周圍的環境更沉鬱而凄其了。</p>
<p>靠着河沿邊有一座牌坊式的木牌，上面寫着“救生會打撈浮屍”的字樣，後面是一間不很高大的木屋，裏面正有一縷燈光透向外面來。</p>
<p>“媽的，那些浮屍一天到晚的打撈不斷，不知從那兒來的？”老張站在板門邊，抽着劣等的烟捲兒，這樣又像嘆息又像發問似的，對坐在燈下的小王說</p>
<p>“那誰知道呢，官廳裏出了這麽大的賞格還沒法破案啦！”小王却把正望在火光上的視綫移了過來，注視着老張作了一個回答。</p>
<p>“天氣是一天一天地熱起來了，要是再這樣不斷地撈下去，眞可吃不消啦</p>
<p>“眞的，老張要是我和你把那案子破了，不是就可以得到一筆大賞賜嗎？老張你說，我和你有了五千塊錢，還會再來幹那沒出息的撈死人工作麽？”</p>
<p>“嘿！破案，那麽容易哪！我恐怕一輩子也不會破案了。”</p>
<p>“誰說，這樣大的賞格貼出了還會不破案嗎？老百姓破了案賞五千塊錢，公務人員破了案升三級，這是宋委員長說的，這數目不是玩兒的，誰都要想……”</p>
<p>“但，又是一個多月了，除了在上月捉住了拋屍工人孔昭元和楊祥以後，可是直到如今還是一點兒綫索都沒有。”</p>
<p>“管他呢，誰不知道××人幹的秘密，可是官廳裏雖然知道也沒有辦法，破案，拿賞格，還會輪到你我……</p>
<p>兩個人談着，不覺都漸漸地睡過去了。</p>
<p>初夏之夜是靜靜的，海河的下游也是靜靜的。祇有夜風吹着槐樹葉子的沙</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>沙聲，和海河裏流水的嘶嘶聲在應和着。</p>
<p>突然，一條白光從龍王廟的斜角上躥了過來，照到豎着的那塊木牌上，照到撈屍工人住着的木屋子上，接着便是兩個穿着制服的警察，掀着手電筒順着河沿走了上來，他們東照一照，西照一照，那樣戰戰兢兢地這裏好像馬上就有什麽事故發生。</p>
<p>“這兒没有什麽，我們還是往這邊去走走看吧，也許會給咱們碰到一個丢屍的。”一個比較年輕點的警察，把電筒向龍王廟照射了一下，説着就想走過去了。</p>
<p>“别！”那個中年的警察一把抓住了他的肩膀説：“龍王廟那邊是××租界。”</p>
<p>“那些浮屍不是從租界那邊淌下來的麽？”</p>
<p>“不！去年是在上游淌下來的，給撈上岸來的大約有五百多個，還有任他淌去的還不算，而今年一個多月來又發現了一百多個，既不像病死或自殺，也不似毒犯，所以給報紙上一登，事情就閙得大家都注意了。於是××人便掉了一個地方，在那些比較荒凉的河灘來撩死屍了。”</p>
<p>“這全是那些可惡的××鬼弄的把戲，那些死的漢子還不是上了他們的當！”那個青年警察説到這裏不禁有點憤憤然了。</p>
<p>“最可恨的是一班没心肝的漢奸，他們只知受××人的利用，自己貪了利，替他們到內地去招募什麽華工，那些浮屍的家屬還在夢想他們寄錢回去呢，你説慘不慘？小金。”</p>
<p>兩個人慢慢地走到龍王廟前，龍王廟那扇大門已緊緊地扣着，他們就靠着門邊坐了下來。那青年警士指着那個木屋子上。</p>
<p>“這裏的人還没睡呢，他們的火還亮着哪！”</p>
<p>“他們白天撈浮屍，現在大概總睡了吧！”他的話剛説完，突然聽到河裏“撲通”的一聲，於是兩條電炬同時向河面上射去，他們跟着也站了起來，向河灘走去。</p>

<p>許多人都說明日的洗車引擎將置在車輛後部。現在就美國汽車城地屈勞哀的一般汽車界看來。他們也以為至少有一家或兩家車廠。一九三八式的新車將採用自動傳動。好像標準或任意的設備。特別是把引擎移置後部。可是最近據自動車工程師協會所傳出的消息。就該會的會員奧斯汀華爾夫氏所說。在過去的幾個月中。芝加哥的市上已有一百輛自動傳動的後引擎公共汽車。行駛任街市之中了。這種傳動的式樣呌做單獨駕駛（Mono-Drive）。包括一種遊行式的傳動機件。前面用三部分速。後面一部。並有自動控制。自動分合機。有兩隻由遠心力作用膨大的內鞋。這種力量是由兩權管轄的重物和牠們的接合連條法及兩個壓力彈簧產生的。分合機鼓由分合機鞋接觸的是傳動組合的一部。用兩種重物接聯在一起。經過一個第一肘形節。到一個平等器。從那一根連接物又展長到第二個肘形節機構。就是使分合機鞋膨大的地方。這種合分機開始工作時。可使引擎每分鐘轉四百次。而最高度達每分鐘八百次。在那個速度。分合機是在全部工作的。任何分合機鞋所增加的壓力。壓在分合機鼓上。是離心力在鞋上自己工作的結果。</p>
<p>為了從每分鐘轉四百次到八百次加速的時候。中間要經過一個很長的滑行時間。但過度的滑動。由於加速器的疾速向下。可以避免的。分合機的工作是始終彌留着。直要等到在每分鐘轉不到四百次的時候為止。在不滿四百次的時候。分合機是停止工作了。在通常情狀的駕馭之下。駕駛，變速，由於加速器板的作用。都是自動的。通常司機的人開始發動的時候。用第二檔可使車輛每點鐘行八英里。加到每點鐘行十四英里。在什麽時候才能換檔是並沒有限制的。這種引擎在任何情狀的起點之下。都可很疾速的加到每分鐘轉二，二○○次。這種公共汽車在每點鐘行駛十英里以下時。傳動會自動的回到第二擋。而每點鐘行駛五英里以下時。換到第一檔。據華爾夫氏所說。這種公共汽車上面的傳動機構和分合機組合。比通常的重量减輕一百鎊。縮短五英寸。芝加哥的公共汽車每輛要駛行二，○○○，○○○英里路程。大致有二○，○○○，○○○搭客的英里。</p>
<h3>韋律司產銷激增</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>頃據確訊。韋律司汽車之產量月有增加。而尤以四月份為突破紀錄。蓋某產量達九八一九輛。據韋律司公司總理威爾遜氏官稱。截至本年五月一日為止。一九三七式韋律司之總產量。計為三八四二一輛。其中原以三月份產量為自去秋制造新韋律司以來之最高紀錄。但今則四月份產額。復較三月份增多百分之四點五焉。又據該公司推銷部報告。所有出品。雖係每日製成後卽行裝出。但定單積壓仍多。頗感供難應求。韋律司之銷售事宜。係由二千三百家經理商承其乏。此次韋律司為推廣全國銷路起見。特發起於七星期由旅行百萬英里之壯舉。經售商家一致熱烈參加。並供給韋律司特麗式轎車二千輛。配以嫩黃車身與綠色保險槓。以供應用。此項壯舉始於四月十九日。將於六月七日終止。舉行以來。成績良佳。蓋全美各處之韋律司零售數量無不激增云。</p>
<h3>春季末的美國汽車事業（續）</h3>
<p>— 宇</p>
<p>“卡迪拉克拉賽爾”暢銷的經過也和上面所說的差不多，今年所運出的汽車數，已經超過去年的總數，而且手頭所接到定單數達二六•○○○輛，卡迪拉克雖在罷工潮中曾停工一個月，可是他們希望一九三七年為最有希望的一年哩，派卡所出的大汽車，深為各方所歡迎，故其銷數也極可觀，克雷斯勒銷售股副經理黃雷碩說，紐約和其他各市的用汽車人，近來很喜歡買我們的高價車，銷數之鉅為前此所沒有的，近來高汽車的售價，較之前二三年要降低不少，這也不能不說是他暢銷原因之一，現在化上美金二•○○○元，就可以買一輛較好的汽車，從前這種汽車至少要買三。○○○元呢，自從不景氣之幕除去之後，許多人又要在高價汽車中選購代步品了。</p>
<p>從一月一日以來的零賣客車注冊數上看起來，獨立汽車商的地又漸形鞏固起來了，據納許廠副經理巴烈士稱，已經造成的一九三七年式納許車，較之一九三六型的納許已經多了不少，司蒂倍克也向前進之路邁進，一九三七年二月份計銷車七•九七一輛，較之去年同時的六•一九六輛，自是增進不少，到三月份止，廠方所銷去的車已較一九三六年同時期多了三•四七二輛。</p>
<p>在三月份中，派卡廠的底特羅工塲曾開足馬力，努力造車，以便能應付零售的需要，他們的大車在市塲土也極佔優勢，所以三月份和四月份都可以認為派卡有大量出品的時期，赫特森所銷的透拉平和赫特森車，比較一九三六年都見進展，因之工潮一經平息，營業方面就大見起色，葛雷亨今年型車的銷數已經增進了百分之三十五，惠萊士哇浮蘭的新型車，其二○•○○○號於三月二日在杜爾圖地方出廠，自從去年十一月三十日以來。惠萊士曾兩次實踐他們的計劃。</p>
<p>獨立汽車商方面近來的營業很見進展，卽就去年而論，一九三六年底獨立商方面的營業額，較之一九三五年為鉅，今年的營業據個中人推測，將更見進步，獨立廠方所製造的商用車及運貨車等，其產額之鉅，比之客車更見衆多哩。</p>
<p>別克汽車公司的出品也有顯著的增進，現在單就一九三六年來講，自從那年九月裏，一九二七年型車上塲以來，一九三六年最後一季的產額共七二•○一六輛，一九三五年同時期為五○•三二九輛，所增達百分之四十三，一九三五年最高峰的一個月為十一月份，那時交貨於零購買主的計一四•二八七輛，一九三六年十二月份新車產額的最高紀錄為二三，○○○輛，那時候最多量產生的星期為十二月份的最後一個星期，弗林脫和樂士安極立斯兩廠平均每日可造新車一•三五○輛之多，一九三五年最後四個月中新別克的產額為六○•九○三輛，其前八個月却祇產四六•七○三輛，一九三六年別克廠所付於工人的工資還美金二五•○○○•○○○元，比較一九三五年增四•○○○•○○○元，平均一九三六年中僱工數每天為一三•五○○人，一九三五年的平均數，則每天為一一•○○○人。</p>
<h3>今世汽油之代用品方家驊</h3>
<p>— 方家驊</p>
<p>今世之汽油猶人類之血液。世界如一日無汽油則無論飛機鐵甲車等。法使其威武。卽一切工業。亦勢將停頓。有人言。國家如缺一點汽油。尤人類之缺少一點血。此語並非過甚。</p>
<p>現世界各國之汽油。除美國有大量生產外。祇俄國足以自給。其餘國家皆大起恐慌。尤其是意•德•日•等國家。平時尚須依賴國外輸入。莫談戰事爆發後之大量汽油。一旦告竭矣。故值此缺乏汽油之國家。莫不提心弔膽乎。</p>
<p>近聞德•日•意•俄•等國家。研究輕氣代用品之製造先以輕氣施以一千磅之壓力。再熱至一千度之高熱。使輕氣成水狀之液化輕。以此而代汽油。以具相當之效力。恐將來不難實行也。</p>
<p>我國近幾年來。公路已臻發達之途。對於汽油之需要。日甚一日。前聞某君有從煤中提取汽油之報告。但未見大規模之實施。尚希吾國科學家之研究耳。</p>
<h3>“滕動作”可免震顫</h3>

<h3>Civil Enforcement Cases Must Not Be Delayed</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] The Ministry of Justice recently investigated that the civil enforcement cases in various courts are often delayed in resolution. Although the reasons for the delay are mostly due to the complexity of the cases, the difficulty of investigation, and other special circumstances, it is inevitable that the delays are also due to the handling personnel's lack of familiarity with the enforcement procedures or lack of experience in handling matters. It must be known that in civil cases, the trial should be clear, but the enforcement should be swift, so as to value the people's rights and maintain the prestige of the court. The ministry specially instructed that in the future, the presidents and officers of the various courts must strictly abide by the laws and regulations, carefully select and diligently assign experienced judges and clerks to handle civil enforcement cases, and must not assign them casually, resulting in delays.

<h3>What is the Most Effective Work for National Salvation During Summer Vacation?</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Speech</p>
<p>[Jiujiang] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, via the Kuling telephone, issued a statement on the 15th to solicit summer rural service students, titled "What is the most effective work for national salvation during summer vacation?". The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Important Responsibility of Young Students</p>
<p>If we want to save the nation and revitalize our people, we must first promote spiritual development and restore our inherent national morality. We must reform all past habits of selfishness, cowardice, hypocrisy and chaos to become a united, loyal, brave and orderly nation. Such an important task cannot be accomplished overnight. We need long-term effort and an indomitable spirit to achieve our goals. Who should bear such an important task? I believe this is the responsibility of the whole nation. Every citizen must have this awareness in order to work together to successfully revitalize our nation. However, to make all citizens have such a thorough awareness, we must have a group of people who lead by example to do the work of awakening the deaf and arousing the dull. This kind of enterprise of leading the masses is a major mission of a group of young people, especially a group of young students. For such an important responsibility, young people have an inescapable and unavoidable duty. Premier Sun said, "The purpose of life is to serve, not to take." When young people are studying at school, it is a period of gaining benefits. If they only know how to gain benefits and do not know how to prepare for future production, then they are simply cultivating social worms. Therefore, today's university and middle school students in China must first establish a correct view of life during their studies, second, they must recognize the actual life of Chinese society and its diseases and shortcomings to do their best to study, and third, they must use their spare time to learn production skills and the work of transforming society and building rural areas. The meaning of the "Student Summer Rural Service" advocated by the New Life Movement General Association is to make our students across the country rise up together and bear the responsibility of revitalizing the nation. Of course, we are well aware that the service work done by students during the summer vacation is not much, but this is the beginning of the students' spiritual construction.</p>
<p>The great advance of development is like the activation of spring after a long period of severe frost. Young people's outlook on life is gradually showing a positive trend, knowing the reality of society, the suffering of the people, and the difficulty of material resources, and understanding the natural duty of serving life. What a valuable piece of news this is!</p>
<p>National Salvation Work is Serving the Countryside</p>
<p>Speaking of construction work, China has urgent needs everywhere. Because our material civilization is very backward, we must catch up in order to stand side by side with the great powers. Seeing that our various construction undertakings in recent years have also achieved considerable results, but if we go to the countryside to take a look, we can understand how bankrupt the rural economy is and how difficult the lives of farmers are. If our rural areas and the lives of farmers are not improved one day, our revolution and our work of revitalizing the nation cannot be considered complete one day. Therefore, rural construction is the most important foundation of various construction undertakings. We should recognize that rural service is the starting point for construction undertakings. If someone believes that young people cannot save the nation in any way except by studying during their school days, this is an extremely serious mistake. It must be known that there are various ways to save the nation. The most important thing is that everyone can do their duty, everyone can use their time without wasting a minute, and everyone can identify their goals and move straight forward. In other words, everyone can contribute their talents to society and the people as much as possible, and this is the essence of national salvation. For example, if students are willing to use their spare time to serve in the countryside and work hard, that is true national salvation work. Moreover, the international situation is deteriorating day by day, and the people's livelihood is becoming more urgent day by day. If we continue to follow the old ways as before and miss the opportunity, I am afraid it will be too late to regret it. The work of revival should "start with the big picture and work on the small details." Don't think that the work of rural service is trivial and difficult, but the meaning of our implementation of service is very profound and great. I believe that young people are the most ambitious and blood-heated people, and at the appropriate time, they will be able to rise up in time. Anyone who can go to the countryside to serve must be an ambitious young person, and anyone who can sacrifice their personal comfort to help others must be a first-class personality with blood. They are not for fame or for profit, they are for doing the basic work of revitalizing the nation. This kind of student who has undergone practical training will surely recognize the actual situation of society and gain countless experiences when they graduate and go to society, be able to fight against evil forces, and not be corrupted by the tide. China needs to produce more of this kind of student to have a solution. The education authorities must be able to educate this kind of student to be considered a success in education. This is the meaning of our advocacy of students going to the countryside to serve. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Li Xing Visits Mei Weiliang to Discuss Anti-Smuggling</h3>
<p>[Tianjin] Li Xing, Director-General of the Ministry of Finance's Land Transport Anti-Smuggling Inspectorate, returned to Tianjin on the 15th after seeking instructions from Nanjing. He immediately visited Customs Commissioner Mei Weiliang to discuss joint efforts to crack down on smuggled goods. Furthermore, the Customs' Xiaoximen branch post in the suburbs of Tianjin was previously occupied by ronin for three days and nights, taking the opportunity to transport large quantities of smuggled goods to outside towns. The Customs, punishing this matter, decided to form an armed anti-smuggling team to guard the post. At the end of last month, it intercepted more than two thousand bags of smuggled sugar, which was auctioned by the Customs for 80,000 yuan and reported to the ministry. (Special dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>National Government Issues Order to Reduce Sentence for Zhao Qingming, Convicted of Murdering Qiang Yi</h3>
<p>—Not Yet Eighteen Years Old</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government issued a clear order on the 15th, stating that according to the Judicial Yuan's presentation, transferred from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, according to the presentation of the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court, the prisoner Zhao Qingming was previously sentenced to one life imprisonment and five seven-year fixed-term imprisonments for committing six crimes, including robbery and murder, and the life imprisonment was being carried out. However, after investigating the age of the criminal at the time of the crime, he was not yet eighteen years old. He was transferred to request a reduced sentence in accordance with the law, etc. Now, in accordance with Article 68 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the period of political tutelage, it is announced that Zhao Qingming's original life imprisonment will be reduced to a fifteen-year fixed-term imprisonment in order to comply with the provisions of Article 5 of the Implementation Law of the Penal Code. This order. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<h3>Developing the Southwest and Completing the Hunan-Guizhou Railway</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Since the Beijing-Yunnan tour group completed its journey of tens of thousands of miles, the attention of the Chinese people has been focused on the issue of Southwest development. Furthermore, the transportation links between Guizhou and the southeastern provinces have become the focus of attention for those who discuss economic development and national defense construction. On the 10th of this month, a long-distance telephone call between Beijing and Guizhou officially began operating. Beijing and Guizhou can talk in the same room. According to the Central News Agency dispatch on the 8th of this month, the Hunan-Guizhou Railway, which connects Zhuzhou, Hunan, and Guiyang, Guizhou, has been decided to begin construction in the autumn of this year. The Ministry of Railways has ordered that it be completed by the end of the 29th year of the Republic of China. Furthermore, the Sichuan-Guizhou and Sichuan-Yunnan railways, which run north from Guiyang to Chengdu and west to Kunming, have also been surveyed and will continue to be built. The completion of this major artery across the country will not only have a great effect on political unification and resource development, but also have important significance and value for establishing national defense and building a base for the revival of the nation.</p>
<p>The Hunan-Guizhou Railway is the most important trunk line in "Chairman Chiang Kai-shek's Five-Year Railway Plan." According to the Minister of Railways, Zhang Jiaao, the five-year plan includes fourteen new railways, totaling 8,140 kilometers. The Hunan-Guizhou route runs from Zhuzhou, Xiangtan, Xinhua, Chenxi, Zhijiang, Yuping, Qingxi, Longli to Guiyang, reaching 1,000 kilometers. Except for 5%, which is in the plains, 95% passes through high mountains and ridges. The construction is difficult, twice as difficult as the Ping-Sui, Guangdong-Han, and Chengdu-Chongqing roads. A section within Hunan Province was personally designated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and a section within Guizhou Province coincides with the route taken by this tour group. In terms of economics, this route has antimony, tungsten, tin, coal, iron, mercury, and other mineral products nearby, as well as forest, cotton, tea, hemp, tobacco, and other agricultural products. Rich natural resources are waiting to be developed. In terms of transportation, this route is the only shortcut to open up the southeast and southwest. It is connected to the Ping-Zhu, Yu-Ping, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi railways to the east, reaching Beijing and Shanghai directly. Connecting to the Guangdong-Han railway can reach Guangdong and Guangxi and the Yangtze River Basin. In the future, when Guizhou and Yunnan are completed and connected to the Yunnan-Chengdu railway, Shanghai and Annam can be connected without relying on sea routes.</p>
<p>However, the importance of the Hunan-Guizhou Railway is more political and defensive than economic. As Minister He Yingqin said on the 10th of this month, "Because of the use of transportation, the central and local political situations are more closely linked." The factual political unification must be promoted through transportation construction. In recent years, the government's efforts in the Southwest transportation network and the opening of air and highway networks have been very active. And its effect has been clearly manifested in politics. In terms of national defense, because the Southwest is the base for our national revival, it not only has rich mineral resources and geographical advantages, but also is close to the mouths of the Indian Ocean. If there is a railway connection between Kunming and Myanmar, the traffic between the Pacific and Indian Oceans can be shortened. In the event of war on the Pacific coast, our coastal provinces along the Yangtze River will be wide open and difficult to defend. If we are unfortunate enough to retreat to the southwest, we can also get a route to international seaports. Therefore, some people call the Hunan-Guizhou and Guizhou-Yunnan routes "the last lifeline of the Chinese nation," which is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>The experience gained by the government in national defense construction in the past seven or eight years clearly shows that first, choosing the last base for the nation, the southeast is not as good as the northwest, and the northwest is not as good as the southwest, because the northwest has no seaports and no sufficient food and other resources, so Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Guangxi are our last base. Second, the base should be linked to the coastal provinces along the Yangtze River. Highways and air routes cannot replace railways, because according to the principles of transportation, highways are only suitable for short-distance transportation and the delivery of small quantities of goods. Air transport is only suitable for the rapid delivery of valuable goods. When it comes to heavy responsibility, long distance, speed, and safety, railways are the best, and railways are more conducive to military transportation. The Soviet Union's Far East defense construction first paid attention to the double-tracking of the Siberian Railway. Japan is also eager to build railways on the front line of Heilongjiang. The motives are no different.</p>
<p>Therefore, the construction of the Southwest railway network is the basic work of national revival, and the Hunan-Guizhou Railway is the main artery of this railway network. From the reports of the members of the Beijing-Yunnan tour group, we know that the current road conditions in the southwest cannot meet the requirements of national defense. We hope that the Hunan-Guizhou road can be completed as soon as possible, opening a way out for the Chinese nation in the towering mountains of the southwest.</p>
<h3>Kong Xiangxi's Group's European Inspection Covers a Wide Range</h3>
<p>Including Light and Heavy Industries, Medicine and Health, Economy and Taxation Systems. Part of the Delegation Returns Home, Part Follows Kong to the United States.</p>
<p>[Berlin] Vice President Kong convened members of the special envoy delegation today and gave a final speech, giving instructions on continuing to inspect the economic and industrial conditions of various European countries. Vice President Kong, together with a small number of the special envoy delegation, such as Guo Bingwen, counselor, Chen Bingzhang, Chen Liting, Yang Guangshun, Li Junyao, commissioner, will take the Mary Queen ship from Cherbourg, France to New York on the 16th and return to Germany within three weeks. The reports of the members of the special envoy delegation who have special missions can be completed after returning to China. After participating in the coronation ceremony of the British King, the delegation members engaged in the study of the economic conditions of various European countries, such as the income tax system, tax organizations, chemical industry, medical industry, and especially the detailed study of social diseases and their prevention and elimination methods. Other heavy industries, such as steel, aircraft factories, and railway management, have also been carefully investigated, so that they can contribute to the government after returning to China. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Dr. Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of China, led several Chinese military attachés to Doublitz, near the capital, today to visit the Olympic Village. The village was used to accommodate athletes from various countries during last year's Games and has now been converted into a military camp. Subsequently, a representative of General Von Blomberg, the German Minister of Defense, accompanied them to visit military exercises, in which many tanks participated. Vice President Kong and the Chinese military attachés were very interested. If there were any unclear points in the various stages of the exercise, the military attachés would explain them. Cheng Tianfang, the Chinese ambassador to Germany, also accompanied Kong to visit the scene today. Furthermore, General Von Blomberg, the German Minister of Defense, had just returned from Italy today and will host a banquet in the evening to welcome Vice President Kong and the important members of the Chinese delegation, and invite Cheng Tianfang, the Chinese ambassador, and important figures from the German military and political circles to accompany them. Vice President Kong may go to Bad Nauheim Hot Springs tomorrow for a short stay and then return to Berlin. Tomorrow evening, he will accompany Chen Shaokuan, the Chinese Minister of the Navy, Weng Wenhao, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, and a few attendants to Cherbourg Port, France to board the British mail ship "Queen Mary" to the United States.

<h3>The United States Pays Attention to the Chinese Market</h3>
<p>Saying the Future is Very Hopeful</p>
<p>Seattle, Ingalls, an official of the Bureau of Domestic and Foreign Trade of the Department of Commerce, said in a speech to the Transportation Association here today that small countries will be the main markets for the United States to expand its trade with the Far East in the future. China's highway, railway, mining, factory, and power projects are developing, and more European and American industrial equipment will be needed. The United States' exports of raw materials and semi-finished products to China will decrease, and China will gradually be able to supply itself, but it still needs European and American heavy industrial products. Ingalls continued that the United States wants to develop the export trade of manufactured products to Japan, hoping that at least the US-Philippines trade is still difficult to predict.

<h3>Forty-Hour Work Week in the Textile Industry</h3>
<p>Labor Conference Did Not Pass</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Textile Industry Committee of the International Labor Conference continued to meet today to discuss the establishment of an international convention stipulating the implementation of a forty-hour work week in the textile industry. The representatives of the Chinese, Japanese, and Indian employers clearly opposed it. Subsequently, at the suggestion of Armstrong, the representative of the New Zealand government, the committee decided to add another clause to the draft convention, stipulating that in some countries, longer working hours than forty hours may be implemented. (Havas dispatch, 14th, Central News Agency)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Bao Huaguo, the representative of the Chinese government, said that the Chinese government, in principle, supports the forty-hour work week, but it is not convenient to implement it. There are many reasons, the most important of which is that in some places in China, consular jurisdiction is still practiced. Nie Guangyu, the representative of the Chinese employers, said that the Chinese employers cannot accept the forty-hour work week, and said that this system is difficult to implement in the current fierce competition, because Japanese investment in the Chinese textile industry accounts for 40%, while British investment only accounts for 5%.

<h3>Japan Actively Expands Production and Develops Large Industrial Zone in Korea</h3>
<p>Operating Seventy-Two Factories with 500,000 Workers, Planning to Integrate Economy and Military Preparations</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Expanding production capacity has become Japan's biggest goal today, and various reform issues arise from this. The common slogan of the military and the munitions industry is that without expanding production capacity, it is impossible to enrich national defense. Along with the continuous development of Japan's heavy industry, the plan to create a huge industrial belt in Korea has also been formulated. No matter from any standpoint, it is extremely important. Korea will eventually become the most important area of the Japanese Empire. Last year, the capital of new industries in Japan headquarters reached 800 million yuan, and for the first four months of this year, it was about 310 million yuan. Last year, the capital increase of old industries totaled 120 million yuan, and this year it has reached 450 million yuan in the first four months. These figures fully indicate Japan's active efforts to expand production capacity. It is reported that Japan will set up new industrial companies in Korea. The ones under consideration are 25 cotton yarn and rayon factories, 13 chemical industries, 3 various trade companies, 8 heavy industries, 3 cement industries, 7 electrical industries, 2 aquatic and forest industries, and 12 steel plants, totaling 73 locations, with a total capital of about 100 million yuan. This company is expected to be built in two or three years, requiring about 500,000 workers. When the Korean giant industrial belt is completed, the so-called national defense government advocated by the military will reach the final stage of completion. The military will propose this year a five-year plan for industries closely related to national defense, and the above-mentioned procedures are only a part of this plan. In addition, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry is now planning to train 500,000 skilled workers to serve in important departments of the munitions industry. This level is extremely noteworthy, because it is inextricably linked to the expansion of production capacity and the improvement of manufacturing technology. Regarding the statistics of physical examinations for army recruits, which show the trend of weakening national physical strength, the army authorities have recently felt uneasy and are trying to improve the situation. Therefore, they are now considering drafting the "Unified National Physical Strength Law," stipulating that from newborn babies to 40-year-old adults, they must be forced to undergo physical examinations. Everyone will be issued a registration form. Babies from six months old will be subject to physical examinations by the city, town, and village authorities. All children who have reached school age will be examined by the primary school authorities. From primary school graduation to the age of 40, the city, town, and village authorities will re-examine them. People who have not reached the enlistment age will be examined once a year, and those who have passed the enlistment age will be examined once every three years. The records of the physical examinations must be noted in the registration book. This plan can not only prevent people from intentionally evading conscription obligations, but also use the power of the government to promote people to voluntarily improve their physical fitness in order to prepare for the general mobilization of the people of the whole country. From this point of view, the spirit of Japanese statism, whether it has been realized or is about to be realized, has spread everywhere, and it is not limited to politics or economics.

<p>[Tokyo] Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro of Japan, due to the economic development plan of Japan and Manchukuo as one body passed by the Cabinet today, which is of extremely important nature, after the Cabinet meeting, went to the Imperial Palace to report to the Emperor and obtained the Emperor's approval. The government today only announced the outline of the plan. This is a national economic policy of Japan that has epoch-making significance. In the past, Japan had fully implemented the spirit of Japan and Manchukuo as one in the military, political, and diplomatic spheres, but regarding the economic aspect, those who advocated taking Manchukuo as a unit and establishing a national socialist utopia separately in Manchukuo were very powerful. Therefore, the above proposal not only had serious friction with general capitalists, but also would make it impossible for Japan's controlled economy to be satisfactorily realized. However, the situation after the February 26th Incident showed that the implementation of high-level national defense and national socialism in Japan proper had become an unstoppable trend. Therefore, it was necessary to quickly eliminate the opposition and friction between the policies of the Japanese government and the policies implemented in Manchukuo. The Manchukuo Industrial Five-Year Plan announced at the end of last year, and the Manchukuo Controlled Important Industries Law enacted on May 1st of this year, have both begun. This law emphasizes the economic unity of Japan and Manchukuo to meet the needs of completing the high-level national defense of the entire Japanese Empire. Since the formation of the Konoe Cabinet, Finance Minister Kaya Okinori and Commerce Minister Yoshino Shinji have repeatedly emphasized the necessity of economic unity between Japan and Manchukuo. The Cabinet's passage of the above-mentioned proposal today makes Manchukuo in principle and in practice a part of Japan's entire controlled economy. Furthermore, this resolution contains another important significance, that is, since the Hayashi Cabinet, Japan has planned to establish an Imperial Economic Conference, with representatives from the Kwantung Army, the Korean Army, the Taiwan Army, the Sakhalin Political Bureau, the Ministry of the Army, the Ministry of the Navy, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry attending, to formulate a unified and adjusted plan for the source of raw materials, market finance, and finance of Japan, Korea, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, and Southern Sakhalin. However, Manchukuo, because it is not nominally a part of the Japanese Empire, cannot join the conference. Now that the policy of developing the economic power of Japan and Manchukuo as one body has been announced, it is possible that the economic production and distribution between Japan and its colonies can be integrated, and the mobilization of the controlled economy and high-level national defense can be carried out in accordance with the comprehensive plan formulated solely by the Japanese government. However, although the political foundation for the Japan-Manchukuo economic group that Japan has long dreamed of has been completed due to today's resolution, there is still a fundamental problem that hinders its realization, that is, the funds needed for the development and publication of the Asian economy are far from being as easy to raise as the Japanese government imagines. This is also sufficient to fully indicate that the expansion of productivity in Japan proper and the resulting increase in import surpluses have caused financial shortages and financial difficulties, which have become the most serious problem, according to the Central News Agency (May 15th).</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Decides on Financial and Economic Policies</h3>
<p>Striving to Avoid Forced Economic Control, Strengthening Economic Ties between Japan and Manchukuo</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Cabinet met from 10:30 this morning, first Prime Minister Konoe put forward a proposal to enrich and develop Japan's economic power, requesting cabinet members to pass it, and Finance Minister Kaya gave a detailed explanation. Later, each cabinet member expressed their opinions, and it ended at 12:25 p.m., when the fundamental principles of financial and economic policies were decided, with the Planning Agency as the center, connecting the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and other ministries, as well as the Central Economic Conference and the Price Countermeasures Committee, etc., in order to promote its concretization. As for the method, geographically, Japan and "Manchukuo" are regarded as one, and in terms of time, it is three to five years, striving to avoid forced economic control, waiting for the autonomous control of the private sector, and planning to combine this comprehensive industrial plan with the national defense plan to become the fundamental way to implement national policy. The general outline is as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Liaison and control of industrial finance and tariff policies between Japan and "Manchukuo";</p>
<p>㊁ Development of resources such as iron ore, coal mines, petroleum, and metals, and the invention and discovery of substitute raw materials;</p>
<p>㊂ Determining self-sufficiency in cotton, wool, timber, food, and other products;</p>
<p>㊃ Research should be carried out on cultivating skilled labor, rationalizing production processes, and increasing efficiency;</p>
<p>㊄ Utilizing surplus labor in rural areas, adjusting the supply and demand of materials;</p>
<p>㊅ Rationalizing the material distribution mechanism;</p>
<p>㊅ Reviewing the Important Industries Control Law and other economic laws and regulations;</p>
<p>㊇ Rationalizing budget preparation;</p>
<p>㊈ Adjusting the distribution method due to tax system reorganization;</p>
<p>㊉ Reorganizing and controlling financial institutions;</p>
<p>㊉㊀ Controlling investment, saving consumption, and balancing international payments;</p>
<p>㊉㊁ Determining fundamental policies to increase exports;</p>
<p>㊉㊂ Preventing the import of non-urgent and unnecessary goods;</p>
<p>㊉㊃ Strengthening exchange management;</p>
<p>㊉㊄ Policies for transporting cash and producing gold;</p>
<p>㊉㊅ Policies to improve shipping and other non-trade income and expenditure;</p>
<p>After the Cabinet meeting adjourned, Finance Minister Kaya told people the following: The fundamental policy announced this time is very broad and complex. The government, in view of the current situation, believes that it cannot be actively implemented without the unanimous assistance of officials and the public. From the perspective of the country as a whole, policies are implemented with the overall interests as the main focus, without bias to any part. There is no consideration of favoring one over the other in taxation. It is deeply concerned about the welfare of the people and plans to find ways to make up for its shortcomings. At the same time, it also intends to consider the material and human aspects of this policy, such as the supply and demand of materials and the assistance of labor. In terms of regions, in order to realize the plan of unifying Japan and "Manchukuo", it should strive to avoid the control of the oppressive economy and wait for the national consciousness to seek progress. In the future, in order to make this policy concrete, a committee will be established with the Planning Agency as the center, with each province coordinating with each other. It is also unknown whether it will be established. The Price Countermeasures Committee must also be closely linked with the Central Economic Conference. The budget preparation for the next year has been approaching, and it is planned to quickly establish a concrete plan to facilitate the implementation. The fourth shipment of cash has been issued, and it is not yet known whether the fifth shipment will be sent within the year. I believe that the shipment of cash is indeed to maintain the exchange rate level, and it will never give the people anxiety, etc.</p>
<p>The government has now decided to send the fourth cash shipment to the United States, totaling approximately 50 million yuan. The first shipment, approximately 17 million yuan, is scheduled to be loaded on the Narutomaru, which will set sail on the 16th to the United States. According to the Japanese Ministry of Finance's cash outflow, this is the fourth time. The previous three shipments of gold have reached 160 million yuan. After the current 50 million yuan of the fourth shipment is completed, the total amount will reach the same amount as the estimated amount of new gold production this year. It is heard that the government believes that if necessary, it will implement the fifth cash shipment. Army Minister Sugiyama told people the following after the Cabinet meeting adjourned: The policy of enriching economic power and its development strategy determined at today's Cabinet meeting considers the industries indispensable for the people's livelihood, enriches them, and establishes trade relations. It is by no means only aimed at national defense, but also expands productivity. Its significance is not only in expanding industrial capacity, but also in summarizing all industries, and mobilizing the entire people to cooperate. This plan should be linked to the economic alliance between Japan and Manchukuo, and should be linked to the industrial five-year plan currently being implemented by "Manchukuo". In the process of implementation, depending on the department, the Japanese side may follow the plan of the country, or the country may follow the plan of the Japanese side. Although there are difficulties in implementation, the national defense enrichment plan cannot be changed due to its difficulties. It is not yet determined when this matter can be completed. It can generally be completed in fiscal year Showa 17, which will be completed in the same way as the "Manchukuo" Five-Year Plan. This is what we hope, etc. The Governor-General of Korea has now established the fundamental policy of industrial and economic policies, and will convene a Korean-Manchukuo Industrial and Economic Liaison Conference in early August with this conference as a prerequisite. The session is scheduled for three days, with the goal of developing economic strategies to promote comprehensive construction. The conference will be attended by representatives from the Embassy in Manchukuo, the South Manchuria Railway Company, the Kwantung Bureau, and the "Manchukuo" government, etc. (Kyodo News, 15th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] There are currently four Japanese commercial officers stationed abroad, and the number will soon double. Commercial officers will be stationed in all newly opened Japanese goods markets. In the future, commercial officers will be jointly managed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (Reuters, Central News Agency, 15th).</p>
<h3>French Cabinet Passes Financial Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Requests Parliament to Grant Full Powers, Finance Minister Bitterly Criticizes Speculators</p>
<p>[Paris] After the State Council met this morning, a communiqué was issued stating that the State Council had unanimously passed the financial measures proposed by Finance Minister Auriol, and decided to request Parliament to allow the government to issue various measures by decree within a very short period of time, in order to seek financial recovery and prevent attacks on people's savings and public credit. Regarding this request, the bill drafted by the government will be submitted to the Chamber of Deputies this afternoon, and the Chamber of Deputies is requested to discuss it immediately. The Finance Committee of the Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to meet this afternoon to review the government's financial plan, and various political parties will also meet separately in the afternoon to decide on the attitude to be taken. The general public hopes that the Chamber of Deputies will quickly pass the government's financial plan, so that the plan can be submitted to the Senate for discussion on Thursday of this week.</p>
<p>[Paris] The financial bill submitted by the government to Parliament contains only one article, which is to request Parliament to grant full power over financial and monetary matters, so that the government can take various necessary measures through the State Council in the form of orders to seek financial recovery, protection of savings deposits, and increase of public credit. This order shall be submitted to Parliament for ratification within three months after the passage of this bill, or submitted to Parliament for ratification within the term of the current extraordinary session of Parliament. According to those responsible, the government's method of restoring finances should be as follows: ㊀ Increase stamp duty and tobacco tax; ㊁ Each railway budget should be forced to offset its income and expenditure. Therefore, in the future, each railway will be able to increase ticket prices. At the same time, the Ministry of Public Works will soon submit a bill to reorganize the management of railways throughout the country, etc.</p>
<p>[Paris] After the government submitted the financial plan to Parliament and requested to be granted full financial power, most members of the Chamber of Deputies commented on it. Among them, there were also many members of the majority party who raised objections to this plan, especially members of the right-wing Radical Party and the Socialist Union Party, which is between the Radical Party and the Socialist Party. As for the members of the Communist Party, although many of them took a reserved attitude, it is generally believed that the party will vote in favor of the government bill, so that the Cabinet can obtain a large majority. Also, after the State Council adjourned this morning, Finance Minister Auriol declared that the government had formulated various plans to reform the finances of various cities and regions, establish a new railway system, and relieve agricultural disasters. At present, the government's finances are under attack by speculators, and the situation is exactly the same as in 1934 to 1926 (that is, before the late Prime Minister Poincaré stabilized the franc) and from May 1935 to May 1936. What the government has decided is to restore the balance of finances with prudence and firmness, and to destroy the attacks of speculators. Since January of this year, bank savings deposits have increased rather than decreased, and the bonds issued by the Pension Fund Management Bureau have also been subscribed very enthusiastically, which shows that the financial situation is very stable. The reason why there is turmoil is all caused by speculators. When we took office, the situation was very difficult, and the people of the country can still remember it. At that time, the amount of railway operating losses increased year by year, and local finances were also often short. The amount of the national treasury used to repay war-time debts accounted for 50% of the total, and the national defense expenditure reached a huge amount of 9,000,000,000 francs per year. At the same time, 6,000,000,000 francs of domestic funds flowed out of the country. If all French people can fulfill their responsibilities, we have nothing to worry about, but there are quite a few people who value private interests, etc. The Minister of Finance then recalled the various measures taken to restore finances since taking office, and said, "All these measures are due to speculators starting to act, and newspapers fueling the flames, issuing pessimistic remarks, so the government had to do it. You must know that if these speculators want to put us to death, we will never sit still and wait for death," etc. (Havas News Agency, Central News Agency, 15th)</p>

<h3>US Senate Committee Insists on Judicial Independence</h3>
<p>Rejects Roosevelt's Reform Plan, Date of Senate Discussion Undetermined</p>
<p>[Washington] The Senate Judiciary Committee today reported to the Senate and rejected President Roosevelt's plan to reform the federal judicial system and expand the Supreme Court. According to the resolution of the Judiciary Committee, it is the biggest obstacle the case has encountered since it was proposed by the President. The Committee stated in its report to the Senate that the so-called judicial reform plan is a cover-up of the true intentions of the government. If the case is passed, the American rule of law system will be shaken, and the Supreme Court will be forced to illegally obey the will of the administrative authorities. From then on, the constitutional guarantee that the executive branch must not be autocratic will be completely extinct, etc. Chairman Ashurst of the Committee originally opposed the case, but now suddenly turned to support it, but the result of this case was still rejected, which was mostly due to the efforts of Senator King, (National News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>[Washington] The Senate Judiciary Committee today issued a report on President Roosevelt's Supreme Court reform plan with harsh condemnation, believing that the President's proposal is "unnecessary, meaningless, and extremely dangerous to abandoning constitutional principles, and conceals its true intentions in a complicated way," and advocating that "it should be severely rejected, so that such a proposal will not be submitted to the free representatives of the free people of the United States again," etc. The reasons for opposition cited in the report are five: ㊀ It cannot achieve its commonly declared purpose; ㊁ It abuses power in the judiciary, causing the court to lose its independent dignity; ㊂ It violates all historical precedents of the US government and establishes a dangerous precedent; ㊃ It directly violates the spirit of the Constitution; ㊄ It tends to expand political power to the judicial branch, etc. The main drafters of this report are Democratic senators King, McCarran, and O'Mahoney, etc., but when the Senate will formally debate the case has not yet been indicated, (Reuters, Central News Agency, 14th)</p>

<h3>British Imperial Conference Closed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hoping for Separation of Covenant and Treaty, Promoting Pacific Pact</p>
<p>[London] The British Imperial Conference held a closing ceremony this morning. Prime Minister Chamberlain thanked the representatives of the various autonomous regions, and said that he deeply believed that this Imperial Conference was beneficial to all parts of the Empire. The Prime Minister then proposed that the representatives of the Imperial Conference submit a memorandum to King George VI, which reads: (Your Majesty, we hereby reiterate our allegiance in our personal names and in the names of the people of the various autonomous regions and territories, and pray to God to bless Your Majesty and Queen Elizabeth to rule the Empire for a long time).

<p>㊀ The governments of the British Empire share the same hope for the expansion of the scope of the member states of the League of Nations and the increase in the momentum of the League of Nations. For this reason, they jointly express the opinion that it is only by separating the League of Nations Covenant from the various peace treaties after the Great War that it is easy to achieve the above-mentioned goals.</p>
<p>㊁ Various regional agreements that can contribute to peace and do not conflict with the League of Nations Covenant are welcomed by the representatives of the Imperial Conference.</p>

<h3>Spanish Civil War Rebels Win Victories on All Sides After a Year</h3>
<p>Bilbao Still Holds the Center, Rebels Attack Santander Again</p>
<p>⊙ Bilbao The Spanish Civil War will enter its twelfth month this Thursday. Currently, the Nationalists seem to be gradually gaining the upper hand. The Nationalists have penetrated deep near Bilbao, and their Commander-in-Chief General Franco has launched a new offensive against Santander. General Miaja, the commander of the government forces in central Spain, has ordered all civilians in Madrid to evacuate. The situation in Bilbao is precarious. At 6:00 p.m. tonight, the British warship Campbell Field sent a team of troops to land in Bilbao to escort the British consul onto the ship. The radio communication between the British consul and the warship has now been stopped. The British destroyer Polypos is currently docked in the port of Santander, and it is said that it also intends to send troops to land to escort the British consul and the British expatriates in the port onto the ship. The Bilbao radio station was silent today, which was very strange. Later, it was learned that the radio station had been occupied by the Nationalists. The radio station is located on Mount Achanda, from which the summit can overlook Bilbao. Tonight, 20,000 women, children, and men over the age of military service in Bilbao took heavy trucks, merchant ships, minesweepers, fishing boats, etc., to Santander by land and water. Basque Autonomous Region President Dr. Aguirre has appealed to British Foreign Secretary Eden, requesting the British Navy to protect the residents of the city from danger before the rebels bombard Bilbao. The British government has granted permission. It is heard that as of 7:00 a.m. this morning, the Nationalists have captured 4,000 people, including Colonel Valdich, an important member of the deployment of Bilbao's defenses. General Franco personally commanded the offensive. The Nationalists who had been fighting for a long time were replaced by newly arrived reinforcements. Spanish ambassadors, ministers, and consuls-general from all over the world have been ordered to return to Valencia, and will hold a secret meeting with Foreign Minister Giral today. The purpose has not been revealed. General Franco has recently moved his headquarters to Burgos, and launched a new offensive against Santander early this morning, with the important road intersections of Espinosa, Tras, and Monteros as the target of attack. Today, rumors say that Dr. Aguirre has established a headquarters in Laredo, midway between Bilbao and Santander, and that the Basque government has moved there. However, the Basque government is still holding meetings in Bilbao, which shows the incredibility of the rumors. According to the Basque Gazette, the Basque cabinet members unanimously decided to stay in Bilbao and defend it to the end. Their views are completely in line with the Army General Staff, etc. The Nationalists are still engaged in suppressing Bilbao, and airplanes are throwing bombs almost continuously, and machine guns are strafing the civilians running away in the streets, causing numerous deaths. Residents of Madrid are ordered to leave the city immediately, and will now withdraw in batches. First, residents of various provinces are to be relocated, followed by the capital, and finally the countryside, (Reuters News Agency, Central News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>Road Widening Rescheduled to Begin</p>
<p>The county government's widening of the road south of Puzhao Temple was originally scheduled to begin on the 1st of this month, but the houses on both sides were not demolished within the time limit, and a request was submitted to postpone the start of construction.

<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Director Accused</p>
<p>Li Huchen, the director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Office in this county, assumed his position last November, taking over tax collection, which was originally a contracted undertaking.  At the beginning of his tenure, he collected funds from various sources, ranging from four to five hundred yuan to a minimum of one to two hundred yuan, totaling twelve thousand yuan, to secure his current position. However, before collecting the funds, he used positions such as section chief and inspector as bargaining chips with creditors.  Consequently, many people like Pu Ou and Mei Ke held positions.  Unexpectedly, after taking office, the number of available positions was insufficient, resulting in a situation of too many monks and not enough gruel, offending many people.  Creditors such as Wu Zihou have jointly filed a lawsuit to recover their debts. The court has scheduled a hearing for the 22nd of this month.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Appointment of Director of Public Property Office</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng, Director of the Wu County Public Funds and Public Property Management Office, submitted his resignation to the county government.

Xu Junlie was appointed as the Deputy Director of the Relief Home.</p>
<p>County Chamber of Commerce Urges Expansion of Main Roads</p>
<p>The Wu County Construction Bureau is widening the ten main roads in the city, and the shops and residences along these roads have been demolished and vacated. The Construction Bureau invited merchants to bid for the road widening project and opened the bids on the 5th of this month. After submitting the results to the Construction Department for approval, the Construction Department rejected the bids due to the excessive bid prices. Director Cao of the Construction Bureau convened a meeting of construction contractors on the 15th to discuss reducing construction costs, preparing to resubmit the plan to the Construction Department for review. On the 15th, it was submitted to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, which resolved to submit it separately to the Construction Department and the County Government, and to send a letter to the Construction Bureau, requesting that the project proceed as soon as possible according to the original plan, in order to alleviate the difficulties faced by merchants.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Bus Overturns on the Wuxi-Shanghai Line</p>
<p>The No. 47 bus of the Wuxi-Shanghai Long-Distance Bus Company departed from Changshu at 8:25 a.m. on the 15th, fully loaded with passengers, heading towards Wuxi.  At 9:45 a.m., while traveling between the No. 3 and No. 4 bridges west of Dongting in Wuxi, the bus encountered muddy ground, making it difficult to drive. Driver Jiang Jinchu, due to a moment of carelessness, caused the bus to overturn, with the wheels facing the sky and the bus lying across the road. The forty-odd passengers in the bus were all thrown about inside the vehicle.  Onlookers, upon seeing the accident, immediately rushed forward and broke the glass on the bus door, then rescued the passengers one by one. Upon learning of the accident, Sun Shikang, the stationmaster of the Wuxi station, immediately used a large passenger bus to transport the injured to the Puren Clinic and the Brothers Hospital for treatment. The doctors at both hospitals treated and bandaged the injured according to the severity of their injuries. Currently, the seriously injured include Zhu Kun, Jiang Axi, Wang Ruisheng, and Shi Minyong, a total of five people. The slightly injured include Li Canglong, Wang Changmei, Gu Wenhu, and Zhou Pu, a total of twenty-four people. Afterwards, Sun Baokang, the stationmaster of the Wuxi station, took a bus again at around 1 p.m. to inspect the overturned vehicle. He also ordered road maintenance workers and mechanics to lift the overturned vehicle and tow it to Changshu for repairs using the No. 9 passenger bus. It is said that the loss from this accident is estimated to be over ten thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Good Sales of Raw Silk</p>
<p>This year's spring cocoon season has already ended. Silk factories in urban and rural areas have started operations, with a total of thirty-eight factories including Yongtai and Gansheng. In addition, Lun Chang, Yongcheng, and Yongxin will start operating around the 20th of this month. It is reported that the overseas silk market has been sluggish recently, and the sales of foreign silk have not improved. However, the sales of raw silk to domestic users have been quite good. This is because silk weaving manufacturers in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Suzhou, anticipating that the price of cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces would be quite high this year, and predicting that the silk market would definitely increase in the future, have been actively purchasing raw silk, causing the market price to rise steadily, with each bale worth over eight hundred yuan. Because this year's spring cocoons are of excellent quality and the reeling process is short, every 380 catties of dried cocoons can produce one dan of raw silk.</p>
<h3>Nanhui</h3>
<p>Suspicious Foreigners Sneak In</p>

Upon reaching the eastern gate of the county town, they reported to the County Bureau, which dispatched detectives to investigate secretly. They found the foreigners having tea at Longquan Garden, with one of them taking out a camera to photograph the cityscape and draw a map. The detectives stopped them and questioned them. They claimed to be Yamazaki Kyushi, Oyama Goro, Tojima Hyoseki, Isono Kingo, and Horiuchi Sadayoshi, visiting Nanhui for sightseeing purposes. However, they had no passports, so officers were dispatched to escort them back to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Establishment of Wheat Demonstration Area</p>
<p>Since the Provincial Wheat Experiment Field began large-scale promotion two years ago, the promoted area has reached 20,000 mu, with the promotion area covering various counties in northern Jiangsu, including Tongshan and Xiao County. Recently, in order to further promote wheat cultivation, a wheat demonstration area will be established in each of the six counties: Feng, Pei, Pi, Su, Dang, and Sui. Each demonstration area will be approximately 400 mu in size, and will be sown with the improved wheat seeds from the experiment field, so that farmers can learn through observation and facilitate promotion.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Severe Flooding Along the River</p>
<p>Continuous mold rain and the water level of the Qiantang River rose again. Heavy rain during the Dragon Boat Festival lashed down, and the Jin, Qu, Anhui, and Puyang rivers surged torrentially, rushing downwards. It is reported that the highest water level standard point at the entrance of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Conservancy Bureau in Wenyan is five meters. On the morning of the 14th, it rose to 4.55 meters, overflowing the dikes. It is reported that the dikes in Wenyanpu, along Changhe, and in the Xixing streets were repeatedly overflowed by the river. The Xijiang dike is in extreme danger. The general populace believes that there will be a major flood this year, and they are all taking precautionary measures. Therefore, residents along the dikes are vigilant, while the cotton, rice, and paddy fields outside the dikes are submerged in water. If the water does not recede, the harvest will definitely be damaged. In addition, the No. 1 and No. 2 A water level of Puyang outside the sandbar has overtopped the dikes, turning the inner and outer fields into a swamp. Farmers are rushing to higher ground for temporary shelter.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Machinery Industry Association Held 10th Anniversary Celebration Yesterday</h3>
<p>Party and government representatives, including Wang Yansong, delivered speeches of encouragement and an Industrial Safety Statistics Exhibition was held.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Goods Factory Association held its 10th anniversary celebration and Industrial Safety Statistics Exhibition yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association. Guests from all walks of life were present, including Wang Yansong, representative of the Minister of the Central Department of People's Training, Cheng Tiangu, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry, Qin Hongji, representative of the Central Factory Inspection Office, Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Zheng Xuehai, representative of Acting Mayor Yu, Wang Jiyi, representative of the Garrison Command, Wu Huanru, representative of the Social Bureau, Xu Peihuang, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Huang Renzhi and Gui Yanfang of the Local Association, Cheng Haifeng of the International Labor Bureau, Lin Kanghou and He Dehui of the National Federation of Commerce and Industry, as well as Pan Xulun, Pan Yangyao, Wang Zhisheng, Jiang Peng, Fang Jiaobo, Wang Boqi, Tao Leqin, Ge Futian, Xiang Kangyuan, Xu Guanqun, Wang Xingyao, Chen Xingqing, Cheng Nianpeng and over 600 others. Cai Shengbai, Hu Xiyuan, Ren Shigang, Shen Jiucheng, and Lu Zhixue served as the presidium. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>After the customary ceremonies, Chairman Cai Shengbai delivered the opening speech, reporting on the association's progress over the past ten years, stating that the association has been established for exactly ten years. He expressed his honor that central party and government officials, as well as municipal party and government officials, and gentlemen, had graced the event with their guidance. He also thanked the Shanghai newspapers for their editorials of praise and guidance, and the association's factories for their celebration advertisements in the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers. In addition, major stores on Nanjing Road and the association's factory outlets held large-scale sales to celebrate. He expressed his deep gratitude on behalf of the association at the commemorative meeting. As for the past situation of the annual meeting, he felt it was necessary to briefly describe it. The association was initially organized by 47 factories representing over 20 industries. At the beginning, everything was chaotic. From the organization of the preparatory committee, the formulation of regulations, the establishment of methods, and the agreement on the direction of progress, the association was officially established on June 15th, ten years ago. As for the work of the past ten years, it has been to reduce taxes, reduce transportation costs, improve accounting, and improve factory management. In general, it can be summarized as "hard work." Because we do things practically and realistically, we never use propaganda as a slogan. Therefore, our current priority is to do everything possible that is beneficial to our association's factories. Now, the number of factories in our association is increasing year by year. To date, there are over 300 factories, divided into 57 industries. The association's responsibilities and affairs are becoming more and more burdensome day by day. The factories of our association must recognize that the association is a members' association, not an association's association. Every action of the association is closely related to the members. Members must work together to ensure the association's sound development, which is the members' sound development. Only then will the commemorative ceremony be worthwhile. He also expressed the hope that government officials would provide more protection and guidance, and that all sectors of society would provide as much help and support as possible, so that the future of national goods would surely be bright and prosperous. National prosperity and people's well-being depend on concerted cooperation. Next, Hu Xiyuan, chairman of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparations for the commemorative meeting and the Industrial Safety Statistics Exhibition.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong's Speech</p>
<p>Wang Yansong, representative of Minister Chen of the Central Department of People's Training, delivered a speech, saying, "Chairman, gentlemen, today I am very honored to participate in your association's 10th anniversary celebration on behalf of Minister Chen of the Central Department of People's Training. When Minister Chen was previously the head of the Ministry of Industry, he was very concerned about the development of your members' businesses. Now that he is the Minister of People's Training, he is not only still very concerned about your members' businesses, but also very concerned about the soundness of your association's organization. Therefore, Minister Chen wanted to attend in person, but he was too busy with official duties and could not spare the time. Therefore, he specifically instructed me to attend on his behalf and say a few words. To make a country's machinery sound, it is necessary to ensure that all forces can develop equally, and then the entire country's strength can be generated. Only then can this country be called a modern country. The so-called various forces refer to the forces of various conditions for national survival, such as military strength, political strength, cultural strength, and even all agricultural, industrial, commercial, mining, and economic strengths. If all these forces can develop equally, then the country's strength will be generated, and then the country can become rich and strong. Our country is now so weak and has suffered the oppression and bullying of strong neighbors. This is because our various forces cannot be developed. Therefore, we should strive to move forward on the road to strengthening various forces in the future, especially in the economic field. Because China's industry is backward, the industrial sector bears a greater responsibility. I hope that you, gentlemen, will uphold the steadfast spirit of the past ten years and make greater contributions to the country and the nation. On the one hand, the government should do its best to protect and guide the industrial sector. On the other hand, the industrial sector should work hard in many areas, such as organization, management, technology, etc., and should continue to seek improvement. Then the strength of the industrial sector will increase day by day, and its contribution to the country and the nation will also increase day by day. Today, on behalf of Minister Chen, I wish you all great success here, and open up a bright path for our country's industrial sector. Finally, I personally have a suggestion, that is, I participated in the Jing-Dian Highway Week Exhibition and saw that there are too many businesses that can be done in the interior, especially the interior's industry, which is in its infancy and needs the industrial sector to develop. This is not only for the country and society, but also for the industrial sector itself to find a way out. I hope you will not abandon this responsibility, that is, do not abandon this opportunity."</p>
<p>Vice Minister Cheng's Speech</p>
<p>Vice Minister of Industry Cheng Tiangu delivered a speech, saying, "Today I am very honored to participate in your association's 10th anniversary celebration. I remember when I visited the exhibition in Hunan, I realized the importance of machinery products. China has always been a country that relies on agriculture, and has never paid attention to industrial manufacturing. Of the 400 million people, 300 million are engaged in agriculture. However, in the 20th century, a country cannot be established by agriculture alone. It must participate in industry. Agriculture is certainly necessary, but industry is also necessary. Agriculture and industry should develop in a balanced way. In recent years, due to the advocacy of the general public, China's industry has gradually developed. The central government has also appropriately reduced the tax burden on domestic goods factories. The government is in a guiding position, and the people are in a cooperative position. Only then can industry progress. There are some speculators who are constantly selling short and buying long, and do not use their energy and materials for legitimate businesses and welfare. This is the most hateful thing. Now our country has embarked on the road of revival. The government is vigorously promoting national economic construction. Although industry has only developed a little at present, it must cooperate with the government in the future in order to achieve greater results. Increasing production is to enrich national strength. I hope that your association will continue to work hard so that the people can fully use domestic goods."</p>
<p>Notes on Other Speeches</p>
<p>Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, stating that the association is a group of Chinese factories and that the development of industry is sufficient to increase social happiness, because industry includes everything from clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The members of the association are all in the machinery manufacturing industry, and the things needed by society in the future will gradually increase. How can we meet the needs of the public and recover our rights? We must pay attention to the construction of heavy industry in order to make the machinery manufacturing industry of light industry more developed. Zheng Xuehai, representative of Acting Mayor Yu of the Municipal Government, delivered a speech, stating that in order to achieve industrial prosperity, we must pay attention to several points: (1) Research the goods needed by society and improve the goods themselves, so as to benefit society and make industry itself more solid. (2) In order to make the products sell, we must pay attention to publicity. Why can foreign goods sell well in China? Most of it is due to publicity. In the interior, we can see advertisements for foreign goods. We should pay attention to this point. (3) In order to make goods trusted by people, in addition to publicity, we must have exhibitions so that people can recognize them. At the same time, we can observe what kind of goods people need. The Municipal Government will also hold a 10th anniversary celebration and has decided to hold an industrial exhibition. We hope that the factories of the association will all participate. Wang Jiyi, Xu Peihuang, He Dehui, and others also delivered speeches, which are omitted here. After the commemorative meeting, the presidium led the guests to visit the industrial exhibition and presented gifts.</p>
<p>Industrial Exhibition</p>
<p>The exhibition hall was located on the fourth floor of the Ningbo Fellow Townsmen Association and was divided into two major sections: industrial safety and industrial statistics. The safety exhibits were transferred from the Central Inspection Office of the Ministry of Industry. The industrial statistics were drawn by the association itself. The collection of factory building machinery, safety and health equipment, and statistics of goods in and out of the factory over the past ten years was very complete. It is reported that the exhibition period is from yesterday to the 21st of this month, a total of seven days. The opening hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM every day. On Sundays, the opening hours are from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Admission is free and all sectors of society are welcome to visit.</p>
<p>Store Sales</p>
<p>This time, the association's factories with retail outlets held a one-day sale yesterday to celebrate the 10th anniversary. Major stores on Nanjing Road also decided in advance to hold a sale to show their congratulations. Therefore, the entrances of major stores on Nanjing Road yesterday were all pasted with slogans saying "Today we celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Machinery Industry Association, and our store is holding a one-day sale." Shoppers were very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>All Passengers Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday, and the Haili Can Be Rescued Today</h3>
<p>Haiyan and Haizhen Arrived in Port One After Another, and the Goods in the Fourth Cabin Were Carried Back by Yongsheng</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haili ship hit a reef on the South Yushan Sea off the coast of Wenzhou, causing a breach in the rear hole of the fourth cabin. Fortunately, Captain Teng Shibiao used his rich experience to navigate out of this dangerous area among the chaotic reefs of South Yushan in the dense fog and darkness, and sailed to a beach on the coast of Taitou Mountain to run aground, so that the hull could be preserved and hundreds of people on board were safe. According to the crew members of the Haiyan who returned to Shanghai yesterday, the Haili was in an extremely dangerous position when it hit the reef. If Captain Teng had not been familiar with the terrain, the lives and property of the entire ship would have been lost. Therefore, Teng Shibiao deserves the credit for turning the danger into safety this time. The Haiyan, after the towboat of Wheelock Marden arrived on the scene on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, transferred the passengers on board to Shanghai. A total of 101 passengers were transferred by the Haiyan ship, and 134 passengers were transferred by the Haizhen ship, for a total of 235 passengers. Together with their luggage and other items, the Haiyan arrived in Shanghai early in the morning yesterday at 5:00 AM, and the Haizhen ship also arrived at 9:00 AM. All 235 rescued passengers disembarked and went home. The passengers who were rescued to Shanghai this time all looked happy and grateful to Captain Teng when they disembarked. The goods in the fourth cabin of the Haili have now been unloaded and carried back to Shanghai by the Yongsheng ship first. The area damaged by the reef is being repaired, so it is expected that the Haili may float out of the shallows today, be towed out by Wheelock Marden's towboat, and then be sent back to Shanghai for repairs at the factory. The loss of goods damaged by water this time is still light, but the cost of hiring Wheelock Marden's boat to tow the ship is 35,000 yuan. In addition, the ship will be delayed for at least a week, and the loss is estimated to be about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, but it is still a great blessing in misfortune.</p>

<h3>Yih Ho Yangtze Steamer "Jihe" Runs Aground at Tongzhou</h3>
<p>Forecastle Pierced, River Water Rushes In; Company Dispatches Steamer to Salvage Passengers</p>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haily" encountered an accident on the Wenzhou sea, and passengers were only rescued back to Shanghai yesterday. Now, the British Jardine Matheson's Yangtze steamer "Jihe" also suddenly ran aground at Tongzhou yesterday, its hull pierced and flooding. Fortunately, the passengers have been rescued. The details of the accident are described below.</p>
<p>"Jihe" Runs Aground at Tongzhou</p>
<p>The British Jardine Matheson's Yangtze liner "Jihe" has a total capacity of 2,665 tons and a registered tonnage of 1,924 tons. Built in 1895, its grand dining room and first-class cabins are beautifully equipped. It specializes in the Shanghai-Hankou route, with regular sailings every Monday and Thursday. This time, on the 14th night, it loaded cargo and passengers at the Gonghe Wharf. At 2:00 AM on the 15th, it set sail for Hankou with the rising tide. After leaving the Wusong estuary and heading up the Yangtze River, after about eight hours of journey, the ship approached Tongzhou. The Qingda Reef on the Tongzhou river is one of the most difficult sections for Yangtze River ships to navigate. A slight oversight can lead to running aground. When the "Jihe" reached this point, there was fog on the river. Due to the negligence of the pilot, the ship struck a reef and an accident immediately occurred. The hull was pierced.</p>
<p>The "Jihe" collided with the reef in the forecastle section. Immediately after the collision, the hull was pierced, and river water rushed into the ship. The captain immediately ordered high tide measures to block the water and telegraphed Shanghai to report to the head office and request immediate dispatch of a rescue ship. Fortunately, the breach was in the forecastle, so there was no immediate major danger, but the passengers on board were greatly alarmed. After reassurance from the crew, they calmed down. When the Shanghai office received the telegram, it immediately negotiated procedures for dispatching a rescue ship and unloading passengers yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>The ship carried a large number of passengers this time. Since the forecastle had been breached and flooded, it was practically impossible to continue sailing. All cargo and passengers on board urgently needed to be transferred to other ships. After discussion, the company dispatched tugs and barges from Shanghai yesterday afternoon to Tongzhou. The first step was to rescue all passengers from danger, or transport them back to Shanghai to take other ships to Hankou and other ports. The dispatched barges were expected to arrive last night. Salvage the Ship Back to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The cargo loaded on the ship included piece goods, cotton yarn, general merchandise, seafood, sugar, and cigarettes, as well as a batch of salt. Among the goods, sugar and salt could not be soaked in water. Fortunately, the breach was in the forecastle, and the cargo was only slightly damaged. It was decided to first unload the cargo from the forecastle, then use cement to patch the hole, drain the water from the cabin, and tow the ship back to Shanghai for repairs. After completion, it would resume sailing.</p>
<h3>Feixin Dun Visits Acting Mayor Yu to Discuss Tobacco Prohibition and Trans-Boundary Road Construction</h3>
<p>Inconsistent Measures Affect the Efficiency of Tobacco Prohibition; Japanese Opinions Often Exceed the Scope</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Mr. Feixin Dun, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, visited Acting Mayor Yu at the municipal government to discuss the issues of tobacco prohibition in the concessions and trans-boundary road construction. Acting Mayor Yu informed him that since Commissioner-General Jiang for Tobacco Prohibition stipulated a six-year prohibition plan, the central and local governments have made the greatest determination to carry out the work of eliminating the scourge of tobacco. If the measures in the Special District are inconsistent, it will inevitably affect the efficiency of tobacco prohibition. Recently, the central government has successively dispatched special commissioners for tobacco prohibition and deputy directors of the tobacco prohibition inspection office to Shanghai to jointly handle matters related to tobacco prohibition in the concessions. All concerns in the Special District should be considered to ensure smooth progress. Subsequently, both parties discussed the measures separately to present them for research at the next meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Mr. Feixin Dun also inquired about the Municipal Government's consideration of the opinions recently raised by the Japanese Consul-General regarding the trans-boundary road construction case. Acting Mayor Yu immediately replied that the resolution of the trans-boundary road construction issue should be based on the trans-boundary road construction itself. The opinions raised by the Japanese side often exceed the scope of trans-boundary road construction, which concerns China's sovereignty and is difficult to accept. If the Japanese side can change its attitude, the Municipal Government hopes to resume negotiations as soon as possible, he said.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Exchange Market Fluctuates; Trading Suspended Again in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Censorate, Together with the Ministry of Finance and Industry, Thoroughly Investigates Accounts; Bears Press Down Market Price; Bulls Unwilling to Sell</p>
<p>Dagong She reported that after Vice Minister Cheng of the Ministry of Industry advised and Mr. Du Yuesheng vigorously mediated the price surge in the cotton yarn exchange market, trading resumed yesterday morning. Prices for both near-term and far-term branded yarn and branded flower all fell uniformly. Bulls also tried to sell as much as possible to maintain the market. Commissioners from the Censorate, together with representatives from the Ministry of Finance and Industry, went to the market to thoroughly investigate the accounts of brokers. When trading opened at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the market price was pressed down by another seven or eight yuan, and the market fluctuated again, making it impossible to trade. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Vigorous Mediation, Both Sides Concede</p>
<p>After Vice Minister Cheng advised both the bulls and bears to try to reconcile within the shortest possible time, Mr. Du Yuesheng also vigorously mediated. Both buyers and sellers expressed concessions. At 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Chen Yu, Counselor of the Ministry of Industry, Yong Jiayuan, Commissioner of the Censorate, Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, Chairman of the Cotton Yarn Exchange, Wen Lanting, Director, Zou Wenmei, Chairman of the Broker Association, Zhou Shaokang, and others exchanged views in the director's office beforehand and then convened a meeting of brokers to report on the progress. At that time, it was decided to open trading based on the red card price of June 11th (Friday), with near-term prices falling by three yuan and far-term prices falling by four yuan as the standard. The bulls tried to sell as much as possible to allow the bears to close out their positions. Both sides fully understood and accepted this method.</p>
<p>Resumption of Trading Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM, the bell rang for the market to open. Director Wen Lanting also personally monitored the market. According to the results of the first round of trading, (branded yarn) June contract was 288 yuan (down two yuan from the red card price on Friday, June 11th), July contract was 281 yuan (down 2.5 yuan), August contract was 279 yuan (down 1.5 yuan), September contract was 278.1 yuan (down 0.9 yuan), (branded flower) June contract was 47.2 yuan (down 1.6 yuan), July contract was 47.4 yuan (down 2.1 yuan), August contract was 48.5 yuan (no stock for September), October contract was 47.05 yuan. By the time trading closed in the fourth round of branded yarn, the June and September contracts had fallen by 3.3 yuan, and the July and August contracts had fallen by about 4 yuan. The market atmosphere was quite stable in the morning, so the bulls sold about 23,000 bales to maintain the amount.</p>
<p>Depressing the Market, Forced Suspension of Trading</p>
<p>After 2:00 PM, trading resumed as usual. In the first round, both buyers and sellers reached out to bid, but the bears further depressed the red card price of the morning's closing by two to three yuan. The bulls were unwilling to sell and also abused the market price. The two sides confronted each other, and the situation was serious. The market was forced to suspend trading again. Blackboards were hung on both sides, and the market situation returned to a standstill. Therefore, the trading ended in a few minutes.</p>
<p>Agreed Strict Enforcement of Disposal</p>
<p>After the suspension of trading in the afternoon, the competent authorities and mediators discussed the method to maintain the market trading of the previous month.

<h3>Latvian Aviator Flies to Shanghai</h3>
<p>This is His Second Visit; He Will Leave Shanghai for Riga Within Days</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reported that Latvian aviator Captain Krkuls flew to Longhua Airfield at 3:15 PM on Sunday afternoon, having traveled from Japan via Korea and North China. This is his second visit to Shanghai, the first being on May 26th when he flew from Hong Kong. Due to inclement weather en route, he made a short stop in Fuzhou. However, yesterday's weather was very good. Mr. Krkuls stepped out of the plane with a smile and was greeted by officials present. According to reports, Mr. Krkuls departed from Riga, the capital of Latvia, in October of last year. He originally planned to depart from Shanghai at 6:00 AM this morning (the 15th) and fly back to his home country. Since arriving in Japan on June 2nd, Mr. Krkuls has flown to major cities, and various groups have made many gifts. The Japanese Minister of Communications also presented him with a large vase at the welcoming ceremony in Tokyo. The English Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that Latvian aviator Captain Krkuls, who was originally scheduled to fly back to Riga from Shanghai at 6:00 AM this morning (the 15th), has temporarily postponed his departure due to a telegram from Fuzhou stating that the airfield there is flooded due to rain. Since Mr. Krkuls must pass through Hong Kong, Hanoi, and Yangon, following the route he flew from Riga back to his country, he must make a short stop in Fuzhou. Therefore, he must wait for the airfield there to dry before he can leave Shanghai. The departure is expected to be within a day or two. It is estimated that he can fly to Riga in ten days after leaving Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Old Cashier Bravely Fights Off Robbers, Protecting Over Ten Thousand Gold</h3>
<p>Four Robbers Stop Car, Robbers Desperately Struggle; Police Chief Check Post, Robbers Fire Guns, Not Escape</p>
<p>Zhu Fulai, 37, from Luodian, works as an old cashier at Chunmao Huixun Qianzhuang, No. 4 Deming Lane, Dou City Street, outside the Dadongmen Gate in Nanshi. At 8:40 AM yesterday, he was ordered by the manager of the Zhuang, Gong Yingkui, to deliver 18,500 yuan to the head office of the Bank of China on Hankou Road. He packed the banknotes with hemp thread. 10,000 yuan was hidden in his shirt pocket, and the remaining amount was stored in a hand-held rattan basket. He hired a rickshaw. As he was traveling near the busy intersection of Guanqiao Laobai Du Street, four robbers suddenly came forward, two wearing black long gowns and two wearing blue cloth short clothes, and stopped the rickshaw. One robber wearing a black long gown showed a pistol, threatening them to remain silent. Three robbers intercepted the rattan basket, but the old cashier Zhu Fulai firmly held on and struggled desperately. Seeing this, the robber with the gun became anxious and fired a shot to intimidate them, but fortunately, no one was injured. At that critical moment, Lin Shaoxian, the police chief of the Shiliupu branch, was passing by checking the post. He noticed many people surrounding the rickshaw and went forward to inquire. The robber with the gun fired again, but fortunately, the bullet jammed in the chamber, which was also a close call. Seeing that the situation had been exposed, the robbers fled in different directions into the crowd without a trace. The original amount of money was not touched at all. Police Chief Lin escorted the old cashier to the police station and sent additional police officers to hire a car to escort him to the Bank of China. The special amount was delivered as planned. Meanwhile, police detectives were dispatched to the scene of the incident and the Qianzhuang to conduct a detailed investigation and track down the bandit gang to bring them to justice.</p>
<h3>Villagers in Qianjiatang Dig Up Ancient Coins</h3>
<p>Shaped Like Ancient Currency; From All Dynasties</p>
<p>About two miles south of Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, Qian Quansheng, a villager in Qianjiatang, discovered a stone slab after digging a ditch several feet deep in the field a few days ago. When he opened it, it turned out to be a hoard, filled with ancient coins. He took them all out, totaling more than a hundred pounds. Their shapes are like the patterns printed on nickel coins (like trousers), and some are like small knives, all made of purple copper and covered with copper patina. According to the age, they are from all dynasties, including Zhou, Qin, Han, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming. The person who hoarded them must have been from the Ming Dynasty, who loved ancient coins and painstakingly searched for them and hid them there. The place must have been a large mansion of an official's family, which was reduced to farmland due to vicissitudes. Ancient artifacts from hundreds of years ago were unearthed in one day. Qian Quansheng, a rural farmer, did not know their value, only that they were more than a hundred pounds of old copper. So, he carried them home, which was known to a group of unscrupulous merchants. They flocked to buy them, deceiving Qian Quansheng, claiming that they were scrap copper and that a certain country was collecting copper, so they were willing to buy them for 300 yuan. Qian was overjoyed. Just as the transaction was about to be completed, it was known to local gentry. They said that the objects were related to the national essence and had archaeological value, so they went to report it. The police station in charge sent police to rush to the scene and took Qian Quansheng and the ancient coins to the station together. They have been submitted to the General Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>An International Women and Children Rescue Organization to be Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that an international organization will be established in Shanghai to enable closer cooperation between government authorities of various countries and voluntary organizations dedicated to preventing the trafficking of women and children, to rescue women and children. This is the result of long-term, dedicated efforts by many residents of this city to establish an agency to curb organized crime in this city and throughout the Far East. It is said that the organization will be named the "China International Women and Children Rescue Federation" and will hold its inaugural meeting this Thursday afternoon. The League of Nations has repeatedly issued reports calling attention to the many women and children in Shanghai and other parts of the Far East who are being trafficked. Recently, a conference on the prohibition of slavery was held in Java. It is believed that the establishment of a powerful and responsible organization in Shanghai is motivated by the Java conference. It is said that Chinese and foreigners will participate in this work. The funding will come from membership fees, donations from various parties, and government subsidies. It is the general consensus that the work of this organization should not be limited to the white slavery issue but should cooperate with various organizations directly concerned with improving the situation of women and children. It is the general consensus that Shanghai is the most suitable location for the headquarters of this organization, as many secret criminal gangs originate in Shanghai and spread to various places. Those who abduct or use other methods to lure women into prostitution are commonly seen in Shanghai. Furthermore, there is a steady stream of Russian women from the north who are abducted and brought to Shanghai. Therefore, it is appropriate to establish a traveler's aid station here to assist women arriving at the North Railway Station and by ships to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Small American Cars to Operate Today</h3>
<p>Fare is 30 cents per mile</p>
<p>After the French Municipal Council approved the operation of small cars in the French Concession, it aroused opposition from major car companies. However, the attitude of the Public Concession authorities towards the operation of small cars in the Concession has not yet been clearly expressed. According to informed sources, these small cars will operate in the French Concession starting today. A total of five cars will be used, and passengers can hail them on the street. The fare is 30 cents for the first mile, and 10 cents for each additional mile. It is said that in the near future, the number of small taxis will increase to fifty, and there is hope that they will be allowed to enter the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Four Overseas Chinese from the Netherlands Suffer from Epilepsy and Return Home</h3>
<p>Already sent to Shanghai Mental Hospital for treatment</p>
<p>Deng Xixiong from Guangdong, Chen Nan from Fujian, Yang Lintian, and Wu Xi, all four were engaged in seafaring and went abroad to the Netherlands last year to earn a living. However, due to unfamiliarity with the place and people, they were unable to find work for a long time, and their funds ran out. Overwhelmed with grief and indignation, they suffered from mental disorders and eventually went insane. Their companions reported this to the consulate in the Netherlands, which approved their repatriation and telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for assistance. Subsequently, the National Health Administration of Nanjing sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government requesting proper arrangements to be made for them. The ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and the relief section of the Municipal Police Department immediately dispatched Deputy Officer Wang Guan and others to send the four overseas Chinese to the Shanghai Mental Hospital affiliated with the Chinese Mental Hospital for treatment. If any relatives wish to take them back, they should first go to the hospital on the west side of Avenue Road and Carter Road to identify them.</p>
<h3>Film Association Asks for the Abolition of the Shanghai Concession Film Censorship Office</h3>
<p>Recently, the film "New Land" was shown at the Donghe Theater on Zhaopu Road in Shanghai. The content included scenes of the puppet Manchukuo and various humiliating scenes of China. The Shanghai film and drama circles have issued a declaration demanding that the government abolish the right of the concession to censor films and dramas. The Chinese Educational Film Association believes that such illegal behavior insults our country and despises our sovereignty and has petitioned the central government to seriously negotiate the abolition of the Shanghai Concession Film Censorship Office and has also sent letters to the Central Film Censorship Committee for assistance. The original petition is excerpted as follows: "According to the Shanghai Shenbao of June 10, more than 300 people in the Shanghai film and drama circles, including Bu Wancang, jointly signed a declaration protesting the release of the Japanese-German co-production film "New Land" in China. At the same time, the Second Executive Committee of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union also resolved to petition for negotiations to stop it. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council illegally established a film censorship office, it has imposed all kinds of obstacles on domestic films. The past disputes are too numerous to mention. However, it arbitrarily indulges films that insult our country's national identity and allows them to be screened. This time, the concession authorities allowed the screening of the film 'New Land', openly promoting acts of aggression, insulting our country, and despising our sovereignty. This is due to the existence of this deformed film censorship system. If our government continues to indulge it, it is tantamount to accepting humiliation. The Sixth Annual Meeting of this association once passed a resolution to 'petition the central government to negotiate and immediately abolish the film censorship system established by the concessions in Shanghai'. The case has been recorded and submitted for your consideration. Now, the Film Censorship Office of the Municipal Council disregards our country's sovereignty and allows the public screening of the film 'New Land', which is one of the absolute reasons for abolishing the film censorship office. For the sake of the nation and the people, this association dares not remain silent and specially submits this news item again, requesting your council to send a letter to the Executive Yuan ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to immediately negotiate seriously and immediately abolish the film censorship system and give deep consideration to the declarations and demands of the Shanghai film and drama circles to comfort the people's aspirations."</p>
<h3>International Music Examination; Buildings Dilapidated; Fei Man'er Selected</h3>
<p>Only 17 years old, studies violin; First Chinese to pass</p>
<p>The Trinity College of Music in London sends professors to various parts of the world every year to select musical talents. The application fee is four gold pounds, about 72 yuan in national currency. The examination was held in Shanghai on the 8th of last month, judged by Professor Albert and Miss Tostoski. Ms. Fei Man'er, a talented student from Hangzhou Art College, passed the advanced violin examination and obtained a violin teacher's certificate. She is the first Chinese to obtain this qualification, which is a glory for Chinese music. Ms. Fei was born in 1920 and is only 17 years old this year. She previously studied piano for three years and then studied violin for four years under the guidance of Professor Botoska. She has achieved this success, which is truly a sign of genius. If Ms. Fei passes the examination once again next year and enters the Trinity College of Music Research Institute, she can obtain an annual pension of 300 gold pounds from the college, which is equivalent to 5,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Stage Shut Down Due to Years of Disrepair</h3>
<p>Police Station Suspends Business License; Theater Forced to Close</p>
<p>The Xiang Stage Theater at 100 Tianshi Road, Zhabei, was opened by Wang Shubao from Yancheng. The building is simple, dilapidated, old, and dilapidated. The house has tilted. The theater does not comply with the Municipal Police Bureau's regulations on seating (900 seats) and ticket sales, without any restrictions. The number of spectators upstairs and downstairs for both day and night performances often exceeds two or three times. The police bureau has repeatedly warned it, but Wang ignored it. A few days ago, the police bureau sent personnel to investigate and found that the theater did have the above-mentioned situation. After the Engineering Bureau was notified to conduct a detailed investigation and careful consideration, it was believed that the theater was dilapidated, old, and tilted, and the floor was shaking, which could cause public danger. (According to reports, several years ago, during the Dragon Boat Festival, a fire truck drove past the gate, shaking the floor and causing the tragic death of more than 20 male and female spectators.) The police bureau was notified to order the Linping Road Police Station to ban the theater. It is learned that the theater's performance license has been suspended by the police station and submitted to the general bureau. At the same time, the theater has been closed. However, a wooden sign saying "Temporarily Closed for Repairs" is hung high on the iron fence at the gate. It is said that local shops, due to business relations, have heard that there will be some expressions of concern about the theater's closure within a few days.</p>

<h3>More Than Twenty Robbers Arrested in the Public Concession for Several Days; A Large Number of Firearms Seized</h3>
<p>Arrested in Three Places Successively; The Police are Conducting a Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department's General Patrol Room and the Old Gate Patrol Room have arrested a total of 20 robbers from the 12th of this month to the day before yesterday, and seized a large number of firearms. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspection Office learned that a large number of serious robbers were carrying sharp weapons and plotting wrongdoing, so he ordered his subordinates to conduct strict surveillance of their actions and residences. After obtaining accurate reports, he led Inspectors Liu Shaokui, Wang Chengying, Song Bingzheng, Zhu Shouling, Feng Zhiming, Detectives Yang Xiguang, Zhou Honglin, Xie Futang, and Western Inspector Jialehua, etc., fully armed, in batches to 84 North Xizang Road and other places between 9:00 am and 12:00 pm the day before yesterday, and arrested the robbers Wang A'er, Guo Xiaosanzi, Ji Changsheng, Ding Jutang, Wang Jieqi, Yang Dianhua, Li Guisheng, Li Xilin, Xu Zhimin, Wang Zhixiang, women Yang Shengshi, Ding Gaoshi, and Chen Ruzhen, etc., a total of 13 people, and seized 3 pistols, 21 bullets, and 1 fake pistol. It was found that Wang and others had committed many crimes in the concession, so they were all detained.</p>
<p>(2) On the night of the eve of the Dragon Boat Festival (i.e., the 12th), at 9:15 pm, four robbers, two of them carrying pistols, broke into the Dahua Watch Store at 547 Guangdong Road, threatened and shouted, and robbed 86 watches worth more than 800 yuan. As they were about to escape, Chief Inspector Wang Chengying, Detective Wang Jinsheng, and Qian Xianting of the General Inspection Office were patrolling in the area. Hearing the alarm, they rushed to the scene. Detective Qian grabbed Zhou Longtian, one of the robbers holding a pistol, and Inspector Wang and others stepped forward to take the gun, which contained 5 bullets. They were taken back to the patrol room. Chief Inspector Lu Liankui learned that the place they had agreed to divide the spoils was 208 Luxuezhai Road, Bailinan Road, so he sent additional detectives to arrest Hu Yizhong from Zhenjiang, Hu Chongxin, Chen Zhengguo, and Chen Xiaokuanzi, a total of 4 people, and seized 31 original stolen watches, which were all detained.</p>
<p>(3) Chief Detective You A'gen and Detective Yang Dechun of the Old Gate Patrol Room learned that a criminal was hiding in Room 14 of the Southeast Hotel at 24 Baker Road. At 2:30 pm on the 12th, he led detectives Zhu Shangwu and Chen Shanji to arrest Han Decai from Yangzhou and seized a lotus-shaped pistol and 5 bullets. Later, his accomplice, Tong Laoer, was arrested at the intersection of Guizhou Road and Beijing Road. It was found that they had committed many robberies recently.</p>
<p>All three cases were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Feng Shide questioned the police lawyer Ru Bao'yi and explained the case, stating that since the accomplices in each case still need to be arrested, the stolen goods need to be recovered, the firearms need to be seized, and the case needs to be investigated, he requested that they all be postponed. After questioning by Judge Feng, all were ordered to be detained and rescheduled for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Xue Xiangyun Case; Chauffeur Appeals</h3>
<p>States Reasons for Disagreeing with the Original Judgment; Trial Concluded After Debate Yesterday, Awaiting Judgment</p>
<p>Xue Xiangyun, the daughter of the late paint tycoon Xue Baorun, has lived with real estate businessman Xu Genchen at No. 2, Lane 106, Maithes Road in West Shanghai for ten years since marrying him. Now, Wang Yongquan from Suzhou has filed a lawsuit against Xu and Xue in the Civil Division of the First Special District Court, claiming that his son, Wang Genbao, was born from an affair between Xu and Xue while he was working as a chauffeur for the Xue family. Therefore, he requests that Genbao be recognized as Xue's illegitimate son. The case has been decided in Wang Yongquan's loss. Xu and Xue also filed a case of fraud and defamation against Wang Yongquan and his son in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. After several trials, Wang Yongquan was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for attempted fraud and ordered to be detained in court. Wang Genbao was found not guilty. This has been reported in this newspaper. Now, Wang Yongquan disagrees with the judgment and has hired lawyer Chen Wen to file an appeal to the Second Branch Court of the High Court. His grounds for appeal are described in detail, divided into five points. The first, second, and third points are all based on facts and laws regarding the part of the sentence for attempted fraud, stating the reasons for disagreement. The fourth point refers to the fact that the appraisal in the first instance was not convincing, saying that when Judge Zhong was questioning the case, he initially ordered the appellant Xu Xue to go to the Shanghai Local Court's female forensic doctor's office for examination the next day, but the appellant refused to comply and voluntarily went to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for examination. Later, Judge Zhong suddenly changed his previous attitude and approved her request. Although the appellant submitted a statement stating that he refused to do so according to law, he ignored it, which was unacceptable. The fifth point is that after Judge Zhong took leave due to illness, Judge Pan Zhenyang continued the trial. He did not renew the trial according to law, nor did he inquire in detail, but began the debate and pronounced the judgment in court with a few words. After the judgment was pronounced, he ordered the detention, which was obviously biased. Based on the above reasons, he should request that the original judgment be revoked and the appellant be acquitted. Also, the appellant has been detained for nearly three months and requests to be released on bail as soon as possible to respect humanity. Yesterday afternoon, President Yu, accompanied by Judges Xiao and Zhou, sat in the Criminal Division 1 of the High Court for questioning. The appellee was not present and hired lawyers E Sen and Tang Shenpei to appear in court. The appellant Wang Yongquan was brought from prison and stated the reasons for disagreeing with the first-instance judgment. Without debate by the lawyers of both parties, the court ordered the conclusion of the debate on the case and scheduled a date for pronouncement of the judgment.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Returning from Spain Fall into Poverty in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Request for Relief</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the civil war in Spain, in order to control food, the government has repatriated overseas Chinese merchants and residents of various countries. There have been several batches of Chinese who have been repatriated. However, these overseas Chinese were all engaged in small businesses in Spain and had no savings. Moreover, affected by the war, the businesses they operated were almost completely bankrupt. Therefore, most of them had nothing left when they arrived in Shanghai. Furthermore, because they had been away from their homeland for a long time, their knowledge of their hometown was also blurred. Although the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau has tried to send some back to their hometowns, there are still not a few who have fallen into poverty in Shanghai. Yesterday, four Spanish overseas Chinese, Wang Jisheng, Wang Baosheng, Wu Changming, and Lu Yutian, etc., because they had been stranded in Shanghai for more than a month, the money they brought had been used up, and they had exhausted their clothes and belongings. They have nothing to live on and are about to become beggars. They specially appealed to various institutions and groups for assistance and asked the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau to provide relief.</p>

<h3>Two Drug Dealers Arrested at the Entrance of Sanle Lane</h3>
<p>The area of ​​lane in the north Sichuan road, Hongkou has always been the territory for the Japanese and Korean that sell heroin, these people do not have fixed places. If they encounter police, they will quietly go away, and after they police went, they continue sell drugs as usual. The drug addicts tend to go to those places. The police are already arresting, but because they have special relationship, our anti drug work is not effective. The drug use atmosphere is still spreading. Yesterday at 10 am, two Korean wearing western suits, held yellow paper bags, and selling small packages of heroin to two Chinese at Sanle alley, Yinxing Road police station, the patrolling officers saw this and immediately went to arrest the two Chinese, and the Korean took the chance to ran away. When the officers went back to the station, they took them to ask, they were called Yu Jinhai, (they found 6 packs of heroin), Han Gengtao, found 3 packs of heroin. The police admits that they taking drugs. Police took this case to Shanghai police station and transferred to Songhu military command for punishment.</p>

<h3>Lawyer Huang Menggang, Young Owner of Gongdelin, Sued for Divorce by Wife</h3>
<p>Disputes Arise Within Two Months of Marriage; Judge Advises Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation</p>
<p>Zhao Guoguang, the 24-year-old young owner of the Gongdelin vegetable restaurant on Pike Road from Huangyan, Zhejiang, works as an accountant in the restaurant. On February 14 of this year, he married Ge Juqing (23 years old) from Ningbo through matchmakers. Within two months of the marriage, the couple began to dislike each other. On April 14, Zhao beat and injured Ge because she refused to take medicine to regulate her menstruation. After reporting to the New Gate Patrol Room, Zhao was prosecuted and fined 30 yuan. Now, Ge has filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court for divorce, payment of alimony, and return of separate property, because Zhao Guoguang often abuses her and she cannot live with him anymore. Her reasons are roughly as follows: On the second day of the plaintiff's marriage to the defendant, the defendant abused the plaintiff on the pretext that the seal on the marriage certificate was upside down. At that time, the plaintiff did not argue with him because she was newly married, but the defendant thought he could be deceived and knew that the plaintiff's brother was far away in Sichuan and had no relatives in Shanghai. He not only did not allow her to step out of the house, but also often humiliated her. On April 11, the defendant Zhao Guoguang and his mother falsely accused the plaintiff of being unchaste before marriage and beat and scolded her. The next day, he beat the plaintiff again. At 3:00 am, she escaped through the window and reported to the patrol room, which has a record. In this situation, it is impossible to live with him again, so she requests that the divorce be granted and that he be ordered to pay alimony of 9,040 yuan (calculated at 20 yuan per month from May of this year until she reaches 60 years old) and return her separate property of 1,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Luo Can opened the Civil Court to summon the defendant Zhao Guoguang, who also appeared in court with his defense lawyer Zhu Cheng. In addition to submitting a defense denying that he severely beat the plaintiff, he said that the plaintiff's injury was because the defendant advised her to take medicine, but the plaintiff threw the medicine bowl and rolled around on the ground, causing the injury. There is a witness, Pang Delong, who can prove it. Finally, he pointed out that the plaintiff had repeatedly filed lawsuits within two months of the marriage, which was a planned act, so he requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be rejected and filed a counterclaim, citing legal principles, etc., requesting that they be ordered to live together. In court, after first questioning Zhao Gejuqing about the facts of the lawsuit and the request, Zhao Guoguang claimed that the plaintiff's claims were not his original intention. He did not abuse her or falsely accuse her of being unchaste. Moreover, when he took the plaintiff to travel around, he repeatedly sought medical treatment for her menstrual problems, so the treatment could not be said to be bad. Therefore, he requested that the monument be persuaded to return home and live together. The plaintiff's lawyer made a statement about Zhao's claim that he sought medical treatment for her, saying that the defendant and others sought medical treatment for the plaintiff on the grounds that she had amenorrhea and told the doctor that the plaintiff was four months pregnant, asking him to be careful. The purpose was to hope that the doctor would write in the plan that the plaintiff was four months pregnant, so that he could falsely accuse the plaintiff of being unchaste before marriage. Since the plaintiff and defendant had only been married for two months, how could she be four months pregnant? In name, the defendant treated the plaintiff with consideration, but in fact, his conspiracy was very deep. Later, after the lawyers of both parties debated with each other, Judge Luo, with the approval of the court, ordered a postponement of the trial and instructed both parties to go out and try to reconcile.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Huang Menggang Restores Membership</h3>
<p>Originally Sentenced to Six Months' Imprisonment; Huang Appealed and Was Declared Not Guilty</p>
<p>Lawyer Huang Menggang from Qidong, Jiangsu, joined the Shanghai Lawyers Association in January 1932 and established his office at No. 1, Taihe Lane, Liyuan Road, Nanshi, to practice law in Shanghai. In April of this year, he was accused of embezzlement and prosecuted by the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate. He was sentenced to six months' imprisonment. The Local Court Procuratorate, in accordance with the instructions of the Ministry of Justice, ordered the Shanghai Lawyers Association to remove Huang from membership. However, Huang disagreed with the judgment and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. After trial, the result was that the original judgment was revoked and Huang Menggang was declared not guilty. After receiving the judgment, Huang has already submitted the original judgment to the Shanghai Lawyers Association and forwarded it to all levels of courts to restore his membership and continue to practice law in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Gang Members Assault Group Members for Failing to Release Gambling Offenders</h3>
<p>Fellow Gang Members Argue with Group Members; Words Become Heated, Suddenly Assault and Injure</p>
<p>The Haiguang patrol ship of the Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Team has recently been undergoing repairs at the Hengchangxiang Iron Factory on the Chunjiang Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong. At 9:00 pm the night before last, several sailors and gunners went ashore together to eat snacks at the fried noodle shop opened by a Ningbo woman, Zhang Zhu, at No. 115 Chunjiang Road. On a whim, they suddenly started playing cards, and dozens of gamblers gathered one after another, shouting loudly, and the situation was extremely lively. The First Team Headquarters of the Yangjing District Security Group received a report and Captain Zhang Haigen immediately sent six group members to the shop to arrest them. The gamblers fled by jumping out of the windows, and the team arrested five people, including Shandong native Qu Shaojing, Ningbo natives Wang Baohua, Qu Jinshan, Cai Axi, and Ying Arong, all of whom were from the Haiguang ship, along with the shop owner Zhang Zhu and the gambling equipment and money, and took them to the team for interrogation. Before long, more than ten gang members from the same ship rushed to the gate of the team, demanding the release of the arrested people. Their words were heated, and they argued with Huang Baolin, a local group member. Unexpectedly, seeing that their purpose was not achieved, they became angry and suddenly assaulted and injured the group member. The other members of the team came out to arrest them, but they all fled in different directions. The injured group member was taken to the Pudong Hospital for treatment, and a medical certificate was issued. At 4:00 am yesterday, the defendants and the injured were transferred to the Pudong Branch Bureau. After the bureau officer clarified the case, the plaintiffs and defendants were transferred to the court for questioning yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Breaking Up a Kidnapping Gang on the Xiangyang Maru and Detaining Them for Investigation</h3>
<p>Customs Water Patrol detectives, on the Japanese ship Xiangyang Maru, broke up a kidnapping gang consisting of Li Zengshan, Ding Yucai, Shi Jingwu, and the kidnapped woman Zheng Jinmei, and rescued three kidnapped girls, Zhou Zhaodi, Chen Xiao'erzi, and Wang Erxiu. After interrogation, it was revealed that the main culprit, Wang Lanfang, was a Dan (female) actress at the Huaiyang New Stage in Zhabei. Wang was immediately arrested, along with the seven defendants, including the guards Tang Desheng and Tang Zhangshi, who were escorted to the District Court Prosecutor's Office at 4 PM the day before. Prosecutor Wang conducted the interrogation, which lasted until 7 PM, before concluding the proceedings. Zhou Zhaodi was ordered to be returned to her husband, Zhou Dasi, to be taken home; Chen Xiao'erzi was returned to her husband's elder brother, Kuai Maokuan. Wang Erxiu claimed to have no relatives in Shanghai, so the Relief Society was ordered to take her back for care. All seven defendants were detained pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>Two Women Using Young Boy to Pass Counterfeit Coins</h3>
<p>At 9:50 PM the previous night, two middle-aged women and a young boy were at a fruit stand on Yaojia Stone Bridge, Datong Road, Zhabei, attempting to buy loquats with counterfeit coins. The fruit vendor noticed and reported it to Officer Dong Yaoxiang of Post No. 13, who went to arrest them. One woman, seeing the situation was not good, immediately fled. The woman Yun Zhangshi, age 30, from Huzhou, was arrested on the spot. She stated that she lived in Dapu Bridge. The boy, Yun Xinfang, age 11, is Zhangshi's son. Fourteen counterfeit copper auxiliary coins (nickel coins) worth two jiao each and ten coins worth one jiao each were confiscated. They were taken to the Xinzha Police Station, where officers learned the details of the situation and obtained information about the woman who fled, Zhang Ajin, who lives at No. 16, Lane 556, North Shanxi Road, Public Concession. Detectives Wu Songshan of the 6th Squad of the Detective Brigade and Xie Zhixian, a detective from the Haining Road Police Station, were immediately dispatched to arrest her. She had already escaped, and the door was locked. Because the case involves disrupting the financial system, it is currently under investigation. (Note: The counterfeit coins are the same size and weight as real coins, but the color is brighter and the sound is like a silver jiao.)</p>

<h3>Dong Miaoying's Lawsuit Against Obscenity; Request to Withdraw the Original Lawsuit Denied</h3>
<p>Case to Be Judged and Sentenced</p>
<p>Fu Zhengcai, the owner of the Caojiadu Bathing Pool in West Shanghai, and Dong Miaoying, a No. 1 masseuse at the Huaxing Press House on Guizhou Road, were figures from the Crystal Palace. It was love at first sight. Dong divorced her former husband and brought her son along to marry Fu, forming a Crystal Palace marriage. Initially, they were inseparable and had two children. However, Fu still wanted to continue his relationship with his first wife, inevitably leaving Miaoying with lonely nights and quarrels, leading to estrangement. Dong then sued Fu in the District Court for abandoning her and falsely claiming to be unmarried, thus committing obscenity. He was summoned, but the defendant did not appear. Now that Fu has yielded and made concessions, and conditions have been agreed upon, the plaintiff requested to withdraw the lawsuit yesterday. The court ruled that withdrawal was not allowed according to law and that the case should be judged and sentenced.</p>
<h3>Tailor Strangles Himself with His Own Belt</h3>
<p>Zhou Yunzhang, age 46, from Ningbo, was a tailor. Recently unemployed, he changed to running a used goods business. He had been cohabitating for a long time with his concubine, Zou's woman Hu Xiuying (33), in the pavilion room upstairs at the Lianghua Electric Material Store, No. 146, Puen Jishi Road, French Concession. Recently, Zhou, for some unknown reason, suddenly had a change of heart and took his own life. The previous night, while his concubine was asleep, he put his Tianjin belt around his neck and strangled himself. The next morning at 8 AM, the concubine got up and discovered that Zhou was already dead, his body cold. The second landlord reported it to the French Concession Police, who transported the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, the Second Special District Court, Prosecutor Wang Ren, arrived at the scene and confirmed that Zhou Yunzhang had indeed strangled himself. After questioning his concubine, the body was released to her for burial. However, the concubine was unable to afford it and requested that employees of the coroner's office ask the Siming Public Hall to provide a coffin for burial in the Tongren Fuyuan Tang cemetery.</p>
<h3>Woman Identifies Corpse on Sappo Saire Road Yesterday</h3>
<p>Claimed Deceased was a Coppersmith, but Not Yet Confirmed</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, at 2 AM, an unidentified man, around 40 years old, was lured to No. 442, Cangqiao Lane, Sappo Saire Road, French Concession. He was suddenly stabbed with a sharp blade, receiving eleven cuts to the chest, back, and abdomen, causing immediate death. The murderer fled the scene. After discovery, the French Concession Police were notified and transported the body to the coroner's office, where the Second Special District Court sent personnel to examine the body, and the Charity Hall handled the burial. This has already been reported in this newspaper. It is now reported that yesterday morning, a woman went to the coroner's office to identify the body. She said that the age, appearance, and clothing were similar to the deceased, who was a coppersmith, and that he was killed because he visited a prostitute. Because a photograph of the deceased had already been taken, it could not be determined whether this was true. Confirmation is still pending. The police are currently dispatching detectives to investigate the murderer.</p>
<h3>Famous Artists Collaborating on Inexpensive Fan Paintings</h3>
<p>Zhang Qiuchong, a famous novelist, has been active in the literary world and enjoys a long-standing reputation. In recent years, he has been resting in Shanghai, cherishing his ink and especially skilled in calligraphy. However, he is overshadowed by his literary fame. His running script and regular script are strong and elegant, each extremely exquisite. As the hot summer has arrived, scholars who admire elegance have been visiting to request calligraphy, keeping him busy all day. The literary and art circles, fearing that this would interfere with his livelihood, have encouraged him to set a reasonable price of only two gold coins per fan, as a modest restriction. Zhang Jinglu, the owner of Shanghai Magazine Company, paints pines and flowers, with a pure and extraordinary style, worthy of being called a masterpiece. His price is the same. If Zhang Qiuchong collaborates with Zhang Jinglu on a fan, three yuan will be deducted from each side. (Zhang Qiuchong also has twenty pages of old book fan paintings, as a way to connect with fellow writers in China, each page is only one yuan, and the fan is given as a gift, but only for two weeks.) Last year, the Haifeng Society commissioned famous artists in the literary and art world, Zhang Danweng, Chen Tingchao, Huang Zhuantao, Tang Dalang, You Bankuang, Pan Yihua, Zhao Mianyun, Zheng Yimei, Wu Nonghua, Lai Lansheng, Yao Jiguang, Huang Nan, Zhang Tianchou, Zhang Zhengyu, Zhang Qiuchong, Zhang Jinglu, Chen Ailu, Lu Yifang, Cao Mengyu, Sanding Yizhu, and dozens of others to create a collection of rare fans, in true script, cursive script, seal script, and official script, beautiful and rare. It was truly a rare and unprecedented event. Therefore, people rushed to order them, considering it an honor to have such a fan. Those who came later could only sigh in vain and still feel deeply regretful. This year, ten more leaves have been specially created for public enjoyment, each leaf still selling for five yuan in national currency, with inscriptions available. Pieces can be picked up within three days (fan given as a gift). Quantities are limited, so please seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Pick-up locations are: Shanghai Magazine Company, Zhongshi, Fuzhou Road, Shanghai. Add postage (and registration fee) for out-of-town areas. The original address will return the pieces.</p>
<h3>Drug Case Cracked at Anle Hotel; Interrogations Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chinese and Russian Suspects Both Deflect Blame; Police Lawyer Requests Adjournment</p>
<p>Song Bingzheng, a Chinese detective chief inspector, and detectives Zhou Minglin, Xie Futang, etc., of the General Inspection Office of the General Police Department, learned that Chinese and Russian individuals were secretly dealing drugs and counterfeit money in Room 27 of the Anle Hotel on North Zhejiang Road. They requested a search warrant from the First Special District Court and secretly went to the address at 5 PM on the 12th of this month, arresting Pan Jialu from Anhui. One bottle of heroin and three sample packets were found in the room. Later, Chen Deji from Shandong and a Russian named Mai Diluo arrived and were also arrested. One bottle of the same heroin was found near Chen. They were all taken to the Shanghai Police Department for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, prosecuted them for the crime of possessing and selling drugs, according to Articles 4 and 16 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Drug Crimes. He stated the circumstances of the case. According to Chen Deji's confession at the police station, the drugs belonged to the Russian, Mai Diluo, and were stored at the home of a Korean named Ji Ming at No. 25, Deshun Lane, Qiujiang Road. He had been asked by Mai Diluo to take a note to obtain the drugs from Ji Ming. It was discovered that Mai Diluo was not only selling drugs but was also collecting counterfeit coins in the French Concession with the intent to sell them. Therefore, he requested an adjournment of the case to investigate the details. The confiscated drugs were presented to the court. Chen Deji testified that he had been a foreman in Pudong for over 20 years and also ran a teahouse. The room at Anle Hotel was rented by him. He had been introduced to Mai Diluo by a friend, Wang Guochang. Last Saturday, Mai told him that he had 30 yuan stored at the home of the Korean, Ji Ming, and asked him to take a note to retrieve it. He knew little about the contents. He went to Ji Ming's place, and Ji Ming handed him a bottle of powder to take back to the Anle Hotel, where he was arrested. Pan Jialu testified that he was in the coal mining business and had gone to the Anle Hotel to discuss coal business with Chen. Chen was out, so he waited in the room and was arrested, knowing nothing about the drugs. Mai Diluo claimed that one of the two bottles of medicine confiscated by the police was called "Bu Di Tuo," a chemical powder that he had bought at a pharmacy on Wusong Road for 3.5 jiao. The other bottle was obtained from the Korean based on Chen Deji's note and he was unaware of its contents. Judge Huang Risheng reviewed the testimony and ordered the three defendants to be remanded in custody for another seven days before further review.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government to Establish Aquarium</h3>
<p>To Increase Citizens' Knowledge of Aquatic Products</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government, considering that freshwater and marine fisheries in China account for a large proportion of the country's output, and that countless people depend on fishing for a living, plans to establish an aquarium in the city center to provide citizens with knowledge of aquatic production and breeding, so as to provide research opportunities and to develop and innovate the fishing industry. The aquarium is a part of the museum's operations and will be overseen by the museum. A site of approximately 14,000 square meters has been designated between Funan Zuo Road and Fuqian Zuo Road in the city center, south of the Qiujiang River and north of Xiangyin Road, as the site of the aquarium. The museum plans to start preparations in July of this year.</p>

<h3>Small Profiles of People</h3>
<p>— Yulong</p>
<p>Remembering Deng Tingzhen</p>
<p>During the Opium War, everyone knows about Lin Zexu, a man from Fujian, but they forget that there was also Deng Tingzhen, a wise predecessor from Jiangsu. In the past year, each province selected wise predecessors, with Jiangsu choosing forty, and Deng was one of them.</p>
<p>Deng was from Jiangning (now Nanjing), Jiangsu. He was a Jinshi (successful candidate in the highest imperial examination) in the Jiaqing era and successively held official posts in Guangdong, Guangxi, as well as the Governor-General of Fujian and Zhejiang, and the Governor of Gansu and Shaanxi. When he was the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, it was during the prohibition of opium. He engaged in battle with the British six times, and the British ships were all wounded and retreated. Throughout his term, British ships were not allowed to enter Humen. Later, he and Lin Zexu were both demoted and exiled to Yili.</p>
<p>Deng was skilled in politics, specialized in the study of ancient sounds, and wrote "Poetry Shuangsheng Shengyun Pu" (Poetry Double Sound and Rhyme Score) and "Shuowen Jiezi Shuangsheng Dieyun Pu" (Explanation of Script and Analysis of Characters Double Sound and Repeated Rhyme Score). He also liked to write lyrics and had a “Shuangyan Zhai Ci” published, full of loyalty, sincerity, sorrow, and laments about the chaos of life. (Bai Hong)</p>
<h3>No-Face-Washing Doctrine</h3>
<p>— Yuehu Huayin</p>
<p>Zhao Shangzhi, a famous general of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army, is resourceful, brave, and good at fighting, and is highly valued by his superiors. After the fall of the Northeast, Zhao felt grief over the changed color of the mountains and rivers and the severity of the national crisis. In addition to leading his brave soldiers in a desperate fight against the enemy, he also embraced the "No-Face-Washing" doctrine. Since the Northeast Province was captured, he has not washed his face, vowing that he will not wash his face until the lost territory is recovered. He said, "The faces of the Chinese people are completely lost, so what is the point of washing our faces?" How should we strive after hearing these words from General Zhao!</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei's Speech</h3>
<p>— Jiao Shijie</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Jingwei, Chairman of the Central Political Committee, is a very skilled speaker. When he speaks, the entire venue is quiet and respectful. Even when talking with him, listening to his high-level arguments, no one ever fails to nod in agreement.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang has a special habit when he speaks, a habit that can be said to be unique to him. Probably Mr. Wang speaks so vividly that not only are the listeners enraptured, but Mr. Wang himself also becomes carried away. When Mr. Wang speaks passionately, he often rubs the thumb of his right hand on the palm of his left hand. The more indignant he is, the more vigorously he rubs. The higher the words he speaks, the more powerful the rubbing. Therefore, after Mr. Wang finishes speaking at a grand meeting, his palm is always rubbed red and feels hot.</p>
<p>This is a special feature of Mr. Wang's speech, and probably something that others cannot match.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's eloquence, writing talent, and memory are all gifted with special intelligence. After every important speech, many journalists ask Mr. Wang to write a copy of the speech himself. Needless to say, the speech is written extremely fluently, and it is exactly the same as the order of words and sentences in his own speech, and it can be written out in the fastest time.</p>
<h3>Li Hongzhang and the Foot-Care Artisan</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guoquan</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang, a Qing Dynasty duke and minister, held the key to Beiyang for more than ten years. He was highly respected and influential. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, he was criticized by the court and the public, and his prestige was slightly diminished. However, the Qing government still relied heavily on him. After Li resigned as the Governor-General of Zhili, there was no immediate position for him. At that time, the strategy of alliance with Russia was strongly advocated, and the Empress Dowager ordered him to visit various countries as a courtesy visit, in order to get a glimpse of the neighbors' intentions. Li received the order and arrived in Shanghai, waiting for a ship to go abroad. As soon as the traveling mansion was settled, he urgently ordered a search for a foot-care artisan (now known as a foot scraper). Li's left foot had calluses on the sole, like flesh thorns, almost an inch deep. A certain attendant, with unique skills in surgery, used to treat it every evening, otherwise he would be in so much pain that he could not touch the ground. This time, the attendant was unwilling to travel far and deserted his post, and Li could not force him to stay. Later, he learned that a certain artisan in a certain bathhouse was the most skilled with a knife, so he summoned him to the traveling mansion and asked him to try it. Li greatly praised him and immediately ordered him to be rewarded with ten gold coins. He then asked if he would be willing to go abroad with a monthly salary of seventy yuan. The artisan did not dare to agree immediately and went home to discuss it with his relatives and friends, who encouraged him even more. He then replied that he was willing. Li rewarded him with another hundred gold coins, ordering him to buy bedding and take care of his family needs, and arranged for him to go abroad by boat. Unexpectedly, after receiving the gold, the artisan became anxious and sleepless because he was leaving his wife and children and traveling alone, and he became mentally ill. He died in less than ten days. Later, Li hired an American artisan in France at a high price, specializing in "foot" affairs, always by Li's side and never leaving. When Li finished his term and returned to China, the American artisan also came with him.</p>
<h3>Li Dachao's Expelling the Barbarians</h3>
<p>— Zongheng</p>
<p>When Wu Tiecheng was the mayor of Shanghai, there was a resourceful section chief in the municipal government named Li Dachao. He could be regarded as Wu's important assistant, as people who read newspapers probably know. It is said that Li named his study "Rangyi Shi" (Expelling the Barbarians Room). The words "Rangyi" are certainly very fashionable these days, and everyone thought that Li's name must have a meaning of the times, but who knew that Li had another meaning.</p>
<p>It turns out that Li's wife, Ms. Wang, is a former member of the Legislative Yuan. She and Li are very affectionate, and Li respects her as a guest. It is said that every time Ms. Wang returns from a meeting in Nanjing, Li always goes to the station to meet her and then returns home together. This can be said to be unfailing. At the same time, because Li really loves his wife very much, he named his study "Rangyi."</p>
<p>What does this mean? Think about it: above the words "Rangyi," aren't there also the words "Zun Wang" (Respect the King)? What does "Zun Wang" mean? It can also be self-evident. A clever double entendre, this is the mystery that Li deliberately created. From this point, we can also see Li's intelligence.</p>
<h3>Kunshan's National Hero</h3>
<p>— Meiren Xiangcao Zhai</p>
<p>Our country is inherently weak, and foreign insults are frequent. Coastal areas are often invaded, and national heroes are recorded in history. Outside the Chaoyang Gate in the western suburbs of Kunshan, there is a former General Bu Temple of the Tang Dynasty. The buildings are spacious, the spirit is remarkable, and the incense is very prosperous. Behind the hall is a tomb, which is the long-sleeping place of a generation of national hero, General Bu. The tomb is built of Kunshan white stone in a rectangular shape, surrounded by a hexagonal cement tomb path, and planted with pine and cypress trees all around. There is an offering table and stone figures in front of the tomb, which makes people feel solemn and respectful. I was serving in this country. During my spare time, I often went to pay my respects. Thinking of the unfinished national crisis and the great difficulties in the future, I often burst into tears. Now I will introduce the deeds of General Bu on the right:</p>
<p>General's surname is Bu, name is Zhen, and courtesy name is Wenchao, from Xihe, Tang Dynasty. During the reign of Emperor Jingzong, the principles and regulations were weakened, and the separatist warlords were riotous. The general was loyal, and when the Tang Dynasty was about to fall, he launched eastern and western expeditions, and his heroic achievements were great, and he was promoted by the world. On the 15th day of the fourth month of the Binyi year, he suffered a slight illness for sixteen days. He bathed and dressed, and died suddenly, at the age of sixty-nine, and was buried in the western foothills of Kunshan. The general has accumulated spiritual miracles. During the Gengwu and Xinwei years of Zhengde, there was a major epidemic in the city, which foreshadowed the response. In the Jiayin year of Jiajing, the Japanese pirates attacked the city, and the spirit of the god appeared, killing the Japanese pirates in the west of the city, so that the city was complete. The county magistrate Zhu Qianshou played a melody into the sacrifice. In the thirty-third year of Jiajing, in April, the Japanese pirates suddenly arrived, from the Sanjiangkou to Dongguan...Xiguan, the city was about to be broken, and the guards were all crying. An old father stepped forward and said: "Just boil tung oil, mix it with filth, and drop it from the gap in the moon city, and the thieves can be captured." As he said, he got two great leaders, tied them to the flagpole, shot them to death, and the thieves then lifted the siege. Qianshou patrolled the city, rested in the temple of the earth god General Bu, and looked at his statue, that is, the old father of Xiguan, so he presented his case, and sacrificed to him in spring and autumn.</p>
<p>Looking at the above historical sites, during his lifetime, he was loyal to the Tang Dynasty and took it as his responsibility to revive the nation. After his death, he showed his spirit and retreated the enemy, so that the territory would not be lost and the dangerous city would be preserved. He has contributed to our Chinese nation, and his achievements cannot be ignored. On the fifteenth of the month, it is the general's birthday, and there is a custom of holding a temple fair. The grand occasion this year is rare in previous years. On this day, thousands of people left their homes, and the place was crowded with people. People from Suzhou and Shanghai came to watch, which is not uncommon. Although it is close to wasting people and money, it is also an excellent stimulant for the national spirit in this national crisis.</p>
<h3>Record of Meeting General Wu Peifu</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>On the fourth day of my arrival in the old capital, it was drizzling. I went to Shijin Garden to visit General Wu Peifu. People in the South have very few records of General Wu's life, only knowing that he closes his doors to study the classics and does not concern himself with outside affairs, "The aging hero only plants vegetables." I felt that his sorrowful and lonely state must be something that fragmented texts and words could not fully convey. Upon arrival, his residence was majestic, with several dozen tall trees standing out beyond the neat and solemn water-磨砖 walls. Two or three soldiers with rifles stood guard at the door, showing no signs of poverty. After submitting my card for an audience, I first met his adjutant, Mr. Hong, who requested that we not discuss political issues, and hinted that Mr. Wu's words might not fully hit the mark. I, as a reporter, already knew this. In his later years, Hindenburg had lost all his vigor, and when guests discussed world affairs with him, he was incoherent and confused, barely able to form sentences. "Time is cruel." General Wu is old, and his thinking is no longer in line with the standards of this era, which is no secret. However, as a typical old-style military man, he has his proper place in the early history of the Republic of China. In terms of integrity and character, no other military men can compare with him. The reason why I insisted on seeing him was partly due to "historical sentiment."</p>
<p>After several minutes, Mr. Hong and Mr. Zhang Fangcong, Wu's chief of staff, came to greet me, saying that Mr. Wu was already waiting in the hall. Heading north from the reception room, we entered a large courtyard, full of various flowers and trees, with singing birds in the middle, a rather beautiful environment. Mr. Wu was wearing a long cotton silk robe, his face full and radiant, quite unlike the gauntness in his old photographs. He rose from his seat to greet the guest, slowly saying, "Have you been here long?" His accent was soft and gentle, and when he spoke, he slightly revealed his teeth, several of which were white with gold inlays, shining brightly. I briefly explained my purpose, and Mr. Wu held my name card, read it, and said with a smile, "Your name is Hui Jian (慧劍, Sword of Wisdom), very good, you can take on national affairs. These two words come from the Vimalakirti Sutra, using the sword of wisdom to break the thieves of vexation. Today's various vexations need this sword to resolve." I knew that his words were profound and extensive, so I took the opportunity to ask what state the turbulent situation in the North would develop into. Mr. Wu pondered for a moment and asked me in return, "I am currently writing a book, have you seen it?" I replied in the negative, so he called his attendant to bring it as a gift, which turned out to be a volume of "A Shallow Explanation of the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan." Mr. Wu pointed to the book and said, "You can read it carefully." I glanced through it briefly, and the book was only one volume, covering the fourth and fifth years of Duke Yin. I was quite surprised that Mr. Wu's book only published this one part. Perhaps it was because it contained sections such as Zhou Xu assassinating the ruler and the Wei army entering Cheng, which could be used for his repeated deductions and expressions of accumulated feelings. Mr. Wu is not particularly scholarly, and there are many far-fetched interpretations in his notes on the Zuo Zhuan. However, it is not impossible to say that they are reflections on current affairs. Such books should be read with a different perspective, what is called a tearful smile, not to be erased with a single stroke. I then asked about the memorial service for Kang Youwei, which had been held in Zhongshan Park. General Wu had a deep friendship with Kang Youwei, but what about his relationship with Zhang Taiyan? Mr. Wu replied, "Also a good friend. Kang Youwei and Zhang Taiyan have similar personalities, but their achievements differ due to age and the times. Kang Youwei was older and came out earlier, becoming the leader of the Protect the Emperor Party. Zhang Taiyan was younger and had overflowing talent, which could not be accommodated in the space below Kang Youwei, so he was激 and entered the revolution. If the two were to switch places, Kang Youwei could be Zhang Taiyan, and Zhang Taiyan could also be Kang Youwei." At this point, Mr. Wu sighed, believing that "After the passing of the two, there are no more literary figures in the country. Although the two have many disciples, none are capable of carrying on their legacy." I wanted to test his views on the New Literature, so I said to him, "Zhang Taiyan has a disciple named Zhou Shuren, pen name Lu Xun, whose literature is excellent. Have you ever read his books?" Mr. Wu seemed quite dazed, as if he did not know the name. I asked for a pen and wrote the two characters Lu Xun to show him, and Mr. Wu was even more confused. He then excused himself, saying, "I do not read books from the Republic of China era, so I do not know this person." I baited him with words, saying, "General, have you forgotten the May Fourth Movement? These were all warriors of that time. I still remember people saying that you, General, had great sympathy for the youth movement. What about today? Do you also have the intention and feelings to approach the youth in the North?" Mr. Wu nodded repeatedly. A certain Mr. Wu's staff, sitting beside him, interjected, saying, "The General is still very concerned about the student movement in Beiping, but he is powerless to do anything." We sighed together. Mr. Wang Jianrong, who came with me, took out a camera and took a picture of Mr. Wu, who seemed quite pleased. From photography, he expanded to discuss the common origin of the three religions, mostly citing theories in the style of the Wushan Society. Mr. Wu's view of life and the universe is greatly at odds with the current era. I do not want to write down his words, and even if I did, they would not form a coherent system.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Wu suddenly spoke to me about Nanjing, saying that when his warships passed by in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the lights of Xiaguan were as if before his eyes, but he did not enter the city. After Feng Huanzhang returned his troops, Mr. Wu hurriedly came south by sea, the Zhili faction's general trend was over, and this was a major turning point in Mr. Wu's personal history. After this came a life of misery and embarrassment as a fugitive, so Mr. Wu's memories of this time were extremely deep. Mr. Wu criticized the terrain of Nanjing, saying that it was not suitable for establishing a capital, saying, "I have Xiakou, and I cannot defend it, let alone Nanjing. Qi Fuwan留 me to live together in Nanjing, I firmly declined it, precisely because I saw this." Mr. Wu also cited Zhang Taiyan's eulogy for the martyrs of the Republic of China as proof, saying, "This place of crouching dragons and crouching tigers is an ancient person's false statement." Knowing that his prejudice was very deep, I then asked if he had any new poems. He said, "I have not engaged in吟咏 for a long time. Recently, I have been writing a shallow explanation of the Spring and Autumn Annals and the Zuo Zhuan behind closed doors, completing several pages a day, hoping to complete it in forty years." He laughed loudly as he spoke, the laughter very loud, as if it contained endless vitality.</p>
<p>After I bid farewell, I further inquired about his private life from Mr. Hong and Mr. Zhao, who said that he did not see many guests and only wrote books. After meditating in the morning, he would definitely eat tangerines. He also organized the Mingjing Study Association with Jiang Chaozong and others, serving as the president himself, with Jiang as the vice president, the two getting along quite well. Xu Lanzhou, his former mentor from the Northeast, would occasionally visit to talk. When asked if Yang Yunshi often came, he was nominally still Wu's secretary, but he did not come often.</p>
<p>Leaving the door, I hailed the rickshaw driver who had brought me, a thin-faced man with a beard, still waiting by the roadside. Seeing me, he smiled and said, "Is Wu Erye in good spirits?" seeming very concerned about his health. The big-headed and clumsy people of Peking University, the typical figure in their ideals, is still "Wu Peifu style." The peddlers and couriers of the old capital are all respectful when they hear Wu's name. This is Wu's comfort in his twilight years, and it is also why his late integrity can flourish.</p>

<h3>On Suicide</h3>
<p>— Shen Qing</p>
<p>Suicide seems to have become a fad recently. Opening the newspaper, one can find a few such reports almost every day. Not to mention being forced to this point (as the saying goes: "Better to live badly than to die well." If not forced to the extreme, who would be willing to end their life?), or dying in an inappropriate way, regardless of whether the reason for death is economic or otherwise; suicide becoming a trend is a loss for the individual family, the country, and society as a whole, a major hidden worry!</p>
<p>Suicide is the act of the weak, we have heard this too much: let's not worry about these for now. Not counting those without suicide notes, those who leave suicide notes before their death generally have a common point: hoping that relatives and friends or compatriots can strive to be promising, do something for the country or their parents, and hold their heads high. But what about themselves? They end it with death. Upon closer examination, this is somewhat laughable: it also confirms the cowardice of the deceased: or, to put it bluntly, it is an evasion of responsibility. Of course, what the deceased sees may be pitch black, and there is no way to "strive," but they also know that changing the pitch black into light is necessarily requires "striving," so they entrust "striving" to others, as if other people's environments are different from theirs, and that to "strive," one must have a good environment.</p>
<p>To tell a joke, this is somewhat like saying that to swim, one must wear a good swimsuit and go to the swimming pool to swim, and once one falls into the sea, one can only let the "environment" swallow them because the environment is dark. Naturally, this analogy is a bit too much. Death is a very serious matter, and the pain of those who have experienced it is so deep. We have no time for mourning and pity, how can we gloat and "eat the dead man's tofu"?</p>
<p>However, sympathizing with the deceased is not as good as using more effort to save the living!</p>
<p>We also know that the words "striving" are very abstract. Shouting "striving" all day long is not necessarily striving. And a dark environment is always a fact. Seeking a ray of light in the darkness, bumping and colliding until one's head is broken and bleeding, is also common. It is of course of no help to oneself to willingly fall down in a dark alley, and it only adds obstacles for those who come later, leaving a bad impression and making them tremble with fear and not dare to move forward. Even shouting "striving" when falling down, hoping that those who come later can step over their corpses, what benefit does this weak cry have in reality? The sound disappears, and what is seen is terrifying white bones and corpses.</p>
<p>Naturally, we will not forget, and we will definitely not let go of who created this dark alley? How and with what was the dark alley created? Not only do we ask for a few bright lights in the dark alley so that people can walk, but more importantly, how to find a way to blast open this pitch-black environment, so that those who come later will never be unable to find a light, feel depressed, feel darkness, and commit suicide.</p>
<p>To do such difficult work, biting our teeth and living on is the first priority. One person's strength may not be enough, but gathering the strength of many people will do. Moreover, even in a dark alley, many people holding hands and moving forward is always more convenient than one person groping. And now there are many people in the same pitch-black environment.</p>
<h3>Dawn</h3>
<p>— Fang Hei</p>
<p>No money, no joy either. I fell onto the flower-patterned bedding, tossing and turning all night with my head covered. The "Ka" brand clock on the bedside still ticked relentlessly. Although it was late at night, it still accompanied me, tirelessly ticking. Like a friend talking there. I felt a kind of joy, and then my thoughts drifted off.</p>
<p>The night dreams of children are beautiful, woven on rainbows and sunsets. At the start of the mundane world, there is vaguely heaven. The shadows of traveling together. I only remember that in my dream, I once reached out and shook down the stars in the sky, and barbs once grew on my back for no reason.</p>
<p>I also had such dreams, but that was far back in my childhood. Now, how can I not yearn to sleep at the bottom of my dreams, but I have not been able to fall asleep for many years, let alone have refreshing dreams.</p>
<p>Last night, the same loneliness accompanied me as I coughed under the lamp. For more than ten years, I have buried my nose deep in the same books, but I am forever trapped in this empty night. I expect a ray of dawn to fall in front of my bed, and to shine on my face.</p>
<p>Outside the rustling window, willow leaves were swaying the embroidered edges of their skirts, echoing with the seemingly meaningless sighs of a young girl. There was a solemn moon, but no sky, and even the sound of the wind was dark.</p>
<p>I found a cigarette and smoked it, the smoke rings were gray.</p>
<p>I pinned my hopes on those few faint stars. Through the heavy curtains, I stared at them.</p>
<p>The dwarf trees in the garden may be bending their waists and shaking their heads, seeming unable to bear the loneliness. But these were all indifferent to me. I only silently faced the faint stars and thought of the approaching dawn.</p>
<p>The night was heavy, hesitatingly sinking from the western horizon. The sticky mist of the night spread languidly, accumulating in the distant west.</p>
<p>And on the eastern corner of the sky, the hazy treetops, the faint light of dawn was peeking at the eaves and chimneys of the thatched hut.</p>
<p>In the depressed shade of the house, there was a low and faint chirping of insects. The wind was blowing, the air was fresh and smooth, surrounded by a gentle atmosphere. There was no mechanical noise, and no time of money and power.</p>
<p>Gradually, breaking through the dark atmosphere, dawn floated out from the distant past.</p>
<p>I climbed down from the warm bed. The great sun on the eastern horizon rolled out half of its red arc, swirling like a vortex, as if in the chaotic universe, the ancient earth was scattering blazing sparks.</p>
<p>I threw open my arms to the eastern sun, then clasped my hands together.</p>
<p>But our children are not even skilled at seeing the morning sun!</p>
<h3>Suspicious Case</h3>
<p>— Xin Ye</p>
<p>The early summer night was quiet, and the Haihe River in Tianjin was also quiet.</p>
<p>On the opposite bank of the Haihe River, a row of modern buildings cast their shadows, the XXXXX Yarn Factory and XXXXX Foreign Company's warehouses. On the rooftops, the flagpole heads vaguely had tattered flags fluttering in the starry sky. On the shallow滩 of the riverbank, there was nothing empty. The surroundings were quiet, with only the sound of flowing water hissing softly.</p>
<p>On the corner of the Dragon King Temple on the left, a dim street lamp hid in the middle of a utility pole. It was as if it were a neurasthenic, opening its失 eyes and shining on the muddy滩, making the surrounding environment even more somber and desolate.</p>
<p>Next to the riverbank was a wooden archway-style sign, with the words "Lifesaving Association Salvaging Floating Corpses" written on it. Behind it was a wooden house that was not very tall, with a ray of light shining outward.</p>
<p>"Damn it, those floating corpses are being salvaged constantly, I wonder where they come from?" Old Zhang stood by the board door, smoking an inferior cigarette, speaking in a way that was both a sigh and a question, to Little Wang sitting under the lamp.</p>
<p>"Who knows, the authorities have offered such a large reward but still can't solve the case!" Little Wang shifted his gaze from the firelight and looked at Old Zhang as he answered.</p>
<p>"The weather is getting hotter and hotter every day. If we keep salvaging like this, it will really be unbearable."</p>
<p>"Really, Old Zhang, if you and I solve that case, wouldn't we get a big reward? Old Zhang, if you and I had five thousand dollars, would we still come to do this unpromising work of salvaging dead people?"</p>
<p>"Hey! Solve the case, is that so easy! I'm afraid I won't solve the case in my lifetime."</p>
<p>"Who says? Will such a big reward be posted without the case being solved? If ordinary people solve the case, they get a reward of five thousand dollars, and if civil servants solve the case, they get promoted three ranks. This is what Chairman Song said, this amount is not a joke, everyone wants..."</p>
<p>"But, it's been more than a month, and after catching the corpse-dumping workers Kong Zhaoyuan and Yang Xiang last month, there hasn't been a single clue until now."</p>
<p>"Who cares, who doesn't know the secrets of what the XXXXX people are doing, but even though the authorities know, there's nothing they can do. Solving the case and getting the reward, will that ever be our turn..."</p>
<p>As the two talked, they gradually fell asleep.</p>
<p>The early summer night was quiet, and the lower reaches of the Haihe River were also quiet. Only the 沙沙 sound of the wind blowing the locust tree leaves and the hissing sound of the flowing water in the Haihe River echoed each other.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a beam of white light shot out from the diagonal corner of the Dragon King Temple, shining on the wooden sign, shining on the wooden house where the corpse-salvaging workers lived. Then, two policemen in uniforms, carrying flashlights, walked up along the riverbank, shining their lights here and there, trembling with fear as if something was about to happen here.</p>
<p>"There's nothing here, let's go over there and take a look, maybe we'll run into someone dumping a corpse." A younger policeman shone the flashlight towards the Dragon King Temple and said, wanting to walk over there.</p>
<p>"Don't!" The middle-aged policeman grabbed his shoulder and said, "The Dragon King Temple is in the XXXXX concession."</p>
<p>"Weren't those floating corpses flowing down from the concession?"</p>
<p>"No! Last year they flowed down from upstream, and about five hundred were salvaged ashore, not counting those that were allowed to float away. And this year, more than a hundred have been discovered in more than a month, which do not seem to be deaths from illness or suicide, nor do they seem to be drug offenders, so once it was published in the newspapers, the matter attracted everyone's attention. So the XXXXX people changed their location and started collecting dead bodies on those more deserted river滩."</p>
<p>"It's all the tricks of those hateful XXXXX devils, aren't those dead men taken in by them!" The young policeman couldn't help but feel a little angry when he said this.</p>
<p>"The most hateful are a bunch of heartless traitors who only know how to be used by the XXXXX people,贪 lợi themselves, and go to the interior to recruit Chinese laborers for them. The families of those floating corpses are still dreaming of them sending money back, don't you think it's tragic? Little Jin."</p>
<p>The two slowly walked to the Dragon King Temple. The door of the Dragon King Temple was tightly扣着. They sat down by the door. The young policeman pointed to the wooden house.</p>
<p>"The people here haven't slept yet, their fire is still burning!"</p>
<p>"They salvage floating corpses during the day, they're probably sleeping now!" He had just finished speaking when suddenly they heard a "plop" in the river, so the two torches simultaneously shone on the river surface, and they followed suit and stood up and walked towards the river灘.</p>

<h3>Rear-Engine Bus Appears</h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Many people say that tomorrow's car engine will be placed in the rear of the vehicle. From the perspective of the automotive industry in Detroit, the automobile city in the United States, they also believe that at least one or two car factories will adopt automatic transmission in the 1938 model of new cars, seemingly standard or optional equipment, especially by moving the engine to the rear. However, according to the news from the Society of Automotive Engineers, according to Mr. Austin Wolf, a member of the Society, in the past few months, one hundred automatic transmission rear-engine buses have been running in the streets of Chicago. This transmission style is called Mono-Drive, including a parade-style transmission mechanism. The front has a three-part speed, and the back has one part, with automatic control and automatic clutch. There are two internal shoes that expand by centrifugal force. This force is generated by two weights under the jurisdiction of the weights and their connection method and two pressure springs. The clutch drum is in contact with the clutch shoe, which is part of the transmission assembly. It is connected with two kinds of weights. After a first elbow joint, to an equalizer. From that connecting rod, it extends to the second elbow joint mechanism, which is where the clutch shoe expands. This clutch starts working, allowing the engine to turn 400 times per minute, and the maximum height reaches 800 times per minute. At that speed, the clutch is in full working order. Any increased pressure on the clutch shoe, pressed on the clutch drum, is the result of centrifugal force working on the shoe itself.</p>
<p>In order to accelerate from 400 revolutions per minute to 800 revolutions per minute, a long sliding time is required in the middle. However, excessive sliding can be avoided due to the rapid downward movement of the accelerator. The work of the clutch is always弥留着, until it reaches less than 400 revolutions per minute. When it is less than 400 revolutions per minute, the clutch stops working. Under normal driving conditions, driving and shifting are automatic due to the action of the accelerator pedal. Usually, when the driver starts, using second gear can make the vehicle travel eight miles per hour, and increase to fourteen miles per hour. There is no limit to when to shift gears. This engine can quickly increase to 2,200 revolutions per minute under any starting conditions. When this bus is traveling at less than ten miles per hour, the transmission will automatically return to second gear, and when traveling at less than five miles per hour, it will shift to first gear. According to Mr. Wolf, the transmission mechanism and clutch assembly on this bus is 100 pounds lighter and five inches shorter than usual. Chicago's buses travel 2,000,000 miles each, with approximately 20,000,000 passenger miles.</p>
<h3>Increased Production and Sales of Wills Cars</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>According to reliable information, the production of Wills cars is increasing monthly, and April was a record-breaking month. The production reached 9,819 vehicles. According to Mr. Wilson, the general manager of the Wills Company, as of May 1 this year, the total production of the 1937 Wills model was 38,421 vehicles. Among them, the March production was the highest record since the manufacture of the new Wills last autumn. But now the April production has increased by 4.5% compared with March. According to the company's sales department report, all products are shipped out immediately after being manufactured every day, but there are still many orders in backlog, and it is quite difficult to meet the demand. Wills' sales matters are handled by 2,300 managers and merchants. This time, in order to promote national sales, Wills has launched a seven-week feat of traveling one million miles. Merchants enthusiastically participated and provided 2,000 Wills DeLuxe sedans, equipped with light yellow bodies and green bumpers, for application. This feat began on April 19 and will end on June 7. Since its launch, the results have been excellent. The retail sales of Wills cars have increased sharply throughout the United States.</p>
<h3>The American Automobile Business at the End of Spring (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>The popular sales of the "Cadillac LaSalle" were similar to what was mentioned above. The number of cars shipped this year has already exceeded the total number of last year, and the number of orders on hand has reached 26,000. Although Cadillac stopped production for a month during the strike wave, they hope that 1937 will be the most promising year. The large cars produced by Packard are very popular, so their sales are also very impressive. Mr. Huang Leishuo, the Deputy Manager of Chrysler Sales, said that car users in New York and other cities have recently liked to buy our high-priced cars, and the sales volume is unprecedented. The price of high-end cars has been reduced a lot compared to the previous two or three years, which must be said to be one of the reasons for its popularity. Now, you can buy a better car for US$2,000. In the past, this kind of car had to be bought for at least US$3,000. Since the curtain of the depression has been removed, many people want to choose a means of transportation among high-priced cars again.</p>
<p>Judging from the number of retail passenger car registrations since January 1, the territory of independent automakers has gradually become consolidated. According to Mr. Balies, the Deputy Manager of Nash Factory, the 1937 Nash cars that have been manufactured are much more than the 1936 Nash models. Studebaker is also moving forward. In February 1937, a total of 7,971 cars were sold, which is a significant increase compared to the 6,196 cars in the same period last year. By March, the number of cars sold by the factory had increased by 3,472 compared to the same period in 1936.</p>
<p>In March, the Packard factory in Detroit ran at full capacity and worked hard to build cars in order to meet the needs of retail sales. Their large cars also occupy a very advantageous position in the market, so March and April can be considered as periods of large-scale production for Packard. The Terraplane and Hudson cars sold by Hudson have made progress compared to 1936. Therefore, once the labor unrest is resolved, business will greatly improve. The sales of Graham's current model cars have increased by 35%. The new car of Wallace Waflan, No. 20,000, was produced in Duerto on March 2. Since November 30 last year, Wallace has twice fulfilled their plan.</p>
<p>The recent business of independent automakers has made great progress. Even in the past year, the turnover of independent merchants at the end of 1936 was greater than that in 1935. According to insiders, this year's business will be even more advanced. The production volume of commercial vehicles and freight vehicles manufactured by independent manufacturers is even more numerous than that of passenger cars.</p>
<p>The output of Buick cars has also increased significantly. Now, just talking about 1936, since the 1927 model car was launched in September of that year, the production volume in the last quarter of 1936 was 72,016 vehicles, compared with 50,329 vehicles in the same period in 1935, an increase of 43%. The peak month in 1935 was November, when 14,287 vehicles were delivered to retail buyers. The record high for new car production in December 1936 was 23,000 vehicles. At that time, the week with the largest production volume was the last week of December. The two factories in Flint and Los Angeles can produce an average of 1,350 new cars per day. In the last four months of 1935, the production volume of new Buicks was 60,903 vehicles, while only 46,703 vehicles were produced in the previous eight months. In 1936, the wages paid to workers by the Buick factory also amounted to US$25,000,000, an increase of US$4,000,000 compared to 1935. The average number of employees in 1936 was 13,500 per day, while the average number in 1935 was 11,000 per day.</p>
<h3>The Substitute for Gasoline Today by Fang Jiahua</h3>
<p>— Fang Jiahua</p>
<p>Gasoline today is like human blood. If the world were without gasoline for a day, neither airplanes nor armored vehicles, etc., could make their power felt. Even all industries would inevitably come to a standstill. Some say that if a country lacks a little gasoline, it is like a human being lacking a little blood. This statement is not an exaggeration.</p>
<p>Among the countries in the world today, only the United States has a large production of gasoline. Only Russia is self-sufficient. The rest of the countries are in a state of great panic. Especially countries such as Italy, Germany, and Japan. In peacetime, they still have to rely on imports from abroad. Not to mention the large amount of gasoline after the outbreak of war. Once it is exhausted. Therefore, countries that lack gasoline are all worried about it.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that countries such as Germany, Japan, Italy, and Russia are studying the manufacture of substitutes for light gas, first applying a pressure of 1,000 pounds to the light gas, and then heating it to a high heat of 1,000 degrees, so that the light gas becomes a water-like liquefied light. Use this as a substitute for gasoline. It has considerable effectiveness. I am afraid that it will be easy to implement in the future.</p>
<p>In recent years, the roads in our country have reached the path of development. The need for gasoline is increasing day by day. I heard earlier that someone had a report on extracting gasoline from coal. But no large-scale implementation has been seen. I hope that our country's scientists will research it.</p>
<h3>"Teng Action" Can Avoid Trembling</h3>
<p>The picture on the left shows the "Winning Action" test to reduce bumps when driving. An electric light is installed on the top of the car. A light is also installed on the front wheel hub. Then take a picture of it in the dark. The line on the top is straight. The next line is wavy. How do you know that the "Teng Action" avoids trembling when moving forward? The car in the picture is a "Chevrolet".</p>
