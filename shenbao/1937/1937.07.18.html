<h3>論科學的精神</h3>
<p>— 徐旭生</p>
<p>科學並不是許多研究結果的總彚，只是一種方法。並且如果想說的更切合一點，可以說：牠並不是一種方法，却是一種精神。因為牠的方法還是可以隨時改良的，至於牠的精神却是永久不變的。這種精神是傎麼？詳細說起來，自然是頭緒複雜，連篇累牘之所不能盡，可是如果約略說起，那也是頗為簡單明了，任何具健康意議的人所全能接受的。這簡單明了的原則是什麼？就是：我們一定要用自己的眼睛去看，用自己的耳朶去聽，……用自己的覺官去感受，用自己的理性去推理。這幾句話有兩方面的意思：第一，我們所要用的全是自己的，並不是人家的；旣不是古人的，也不是外國人的。無緣無故要拆毀玄武湖附近的城牆，以後聽到高鼻子緣眼請的人們的抗議，說玄武湖風景的奇麗，就是全靠這段古城的掩映襟帶，才趕緊停止了破壞的工作；這就是不用自己的眼睛去看的一例。因為我國從前女子不登歌舞樓臺，串演女子的且角就作出來一種矯揉造作的奇怪聲音。自此以後，謬種流傳，大家競相仿效，視為正聲，以至於女子演唱也來模仿這樣的聲音並沒有一個人來問問：什麼時候，什麼女子，天然的引吭高歌，能發出這樣奇怪的聲音，——皮黃中正生的聲音，還離天然的聲音不遠，未可一槪而論——這就是不能用自己的耳朶去聽的一例。對於自然界和人羣，沒有濃摯的同情和精密的觀察，只對於文選派，唐派，宋派，或浪漫派，自然派等類的爭吵，成是“月兒虹，花兒呀”的亂呌：那就是不能用自己的覺官去感受。因為外國有審計制度，我們就照樣的抄來，不曉得工商業社會的制度怎麼樣能夠適用於農業社會裹面！歸結，如果有一個傻子眞去實報實銷，就沒有不被駁斥的辦法！以至於賢者，愚者，作弊者，實支者，對於報銷，却沒有一個人敢不去“做”！上下以偽相欺，以求合於與社會情形完全不合的統訐制度！這就是不敢用自己的理性去推理的結果。——我說這一段話，請大家不要誤會：這旣不是說審計制度應該廢止，也並不是說我國舊審計制度勝於現行的制度。我只是要說：經濟狀况不同的社會就應該有不同的審計制度。盲目的抄襲別人，是沒有用的。我國近日的教育，司法以及其他的社會制度，幾乎沒有一件不犯同樣的毛病。數十年來，很多社會裏面的糾紛，全是起於留學法國的人抄襲法國人的感受和推理，留學德國的人抄襲德國人的感受和推理，不肯細心研究我國的社會究竟是什麼樣子，只去一知半解，鼻子不對嘴的亂嚷嚷。——道幾句話的第二箇意思，就是我們要去看，所當用的是我們自己的眼睛，旣不是其他的覺官，也不是其他的心理作用。依此類推，以耳作目的人拿耳朶替代眼睛，就鬧出很多的笑話。黃昏走到野外，看見一株枯木，因為朦朧不清，拿自己恐駭的情感和幻想（lmagination）去補足牠，就變成一箇駭人的奇鬼，那也是不能盡眼睛的用處，却拿其他的心理作用去替代牠，就鬧山來很古怪的錯覺。對於論理學及方法學中平通正大並且無從否認的道理不願注意，僅掇拾些片段的感覺為希奇古怪的理論作辯護，那也是不用自己的那性去推理，却去用些不完不備的感覺去替代牠，也會鬧出來對於學術不可救藥的熊度。固然，人類的感覺常常是騙人的，想使牠為精確知議的基礎，常常需要用精良的器械來輔助牠，校正牠。並且，人類的感覺是極有限度的，比方說：音波高到什麼數目或低過什麼數目，我們的聽覺就完全感不到。有時候，我們靠著機械的助力還可以感受到原來覺官所感受不到的東西，比方說：由于光學的進步，我們可以感受到從來所不知道的紫外綫和紅內綫。但是，無論怎麼樣，這一些全是用我們自己種種的努力，使我們自己的感覺達到最大的限度，我們的看還得用我們自己的眼睛，我們的聽還得用我們自己的耳朶，……我們的推理還得用我們自己的理性。這一切的心理能力應該是互相輔助，却是不能互相替代的。用自己的覺官去感受，用自己的理性去推理的成效大騐，我們可以隨便舉出幾箇：俄國文學的發展，到現在還不過二百年的歷史，並且他們離西歐文學先進的國家很近，跟着他們的尾巴後頭追也很方便。但是，俄國十九世紀的文豪，比方說：托爾斯太，陀斯陶葉夫斯基等人，受西歐文學的影響是一定的，可是他們感受的方法却是另外的，他們對於人類全體所具深摯的情感是西歐文學家所沒有的東西。所以雖說他們的楞史很短，並且受西歐文學界很大的影響，可是把他們自有的東西拿出來，又使歐洲文壇受鉅大的震動。我們中國文學的發展已經有了幾千年的歷史，但是能使世界文壇受鉅大震動的作品還算沒有。近一二十年來，大家儘著跟在人家的尾巴後追，而且也有相當的成續，可是使世界文壇受震動的作品在最近似乎還不見得能生產出來。這裏面的原因自然也夠複雜，但是主要的原因却是俄國的文學家“敢”並且“能”用自己的覺官感受，而我國的文學家一直到現在，似乎還不很敢，至於能不能却更難說。歐洲的文藝復興本來不過是一種復古的運動，但是，研究未久，已經發現出來希臘人的思想方法精密而空虛，完全跟著他們走，不能有什麼大結果，就很勇敢的，很堅苦的，自闢蹊徑，創造出來近世的經騐學派，而後西方的文化在十八九世紀才有盛大的開展：這也是能用自己的理性去推理的結果。現在我們的學術界，如果絕不想有所建樹那也就完了，如果還想有些建樹，那對於這基礎的一點總要弄清楚：跟隨主張中學為體，西學為用的人的純中國觀點，自然是走不通，跟隨主張全盤西化的人純西洋觀點，一定也要走到碰壁！他們一邊有中國舊東西作靠山，一邊有西洋的新東西作支持，那對於我們這些扶向東來又西倒的人自然是很方便，我們所主張的路，任我們自己的理性，無倚無靠，獨往獨來，那是很堅苦的，很不方便的。但是，方便是一件事，成功却是另外一件事。人家眞正成功的人全是從很堅苦的路走上來。自然的母親大約是不喜歡懶惰的兒子，所以不肯給他們方便的路走，却用種種苦惱的法子去磨練他們，看他們是否有勇氣來衝破她所故意設出的障碍物！有這樣勇氣的人才算是母親的肖子，才配受母親的寵待！這是歷史上的鐵律，從來沒有看見過例外！然則我們又將何去何從呢？</p>

<h3>西班牙內戰的透視（上）</h3>
<p>— （法國通信）</p>
<p>㊀內戰的槪况</p>
<p>西班牙內戰自去年七月十八日發生以來、忽忽快要有一年了。叛軍弗朗哥將軍得到世界獨裁國家德意之助、各種重要軍械飛機、不愁沒有、德意更派遣大批正式軍隊，參加作戰，以致戰事延長，至今，尚未能分勝負。西班牙政府，於叛亂開始時，全賴民衆為後盾，忽促間武裝參加，以抗叛變軍隊。此種民眾軍隊，因平時旣未經訓練，而組織方面，又復名稱多端，號令不能統一，有此兩種缺點，以致與叛軍抗戰，着着失敗。意湖（Irum）之役、更因子彈不繼而失守，（子彈車一列，由巴塞洛納出發，因不干涉政策已實行之故，被扣留在法境）。巴達學士（Badajoz)之役，政府之民團軍，被叛軍俘虜慘殺者，據路透社訪員的報告，約有四千人，全械牆上，血染成赤色。西政府深知兩役戰敗，並非士兵之不能戰，而在於軍隊組廠，與軍令統一之缺陷，特將軍隊改組，統一指揮。而世界各國的反法西斯蒂民衆，亦相繼赴西，組織所謂國際自願軍，參加瑪德里方面作戰，（我國旅巴黎僑胞一人，曾加入在內，專任救護事宜，勇往直前，已救回不少受傷者，大為國際隊所贊揚），但軍械方面，未能像德意軍隊的充足而完備，人數亦較少，致西京瑪德里在去年十一月間與本年二月間，曾兩次險些失守，而均能轉危為安，則不能不歸功於瑪德里防守軍總司令米阿亞（Miafa）將軍的功績了。現在瑪德里方面政府軍，已反守為攻，到處勝利，着着進展。但是政府軍何以忽能轉敗為勝。其中最大的一個原因就是擔任攻擊西京東北方的瓜達拉迦拉（Guadalagara）前錢的意大利軍隊之無鬥志，一戰而敗，連續潰退，（被俘虜者多至千餘人，內有營旅長多人）。意軍之敗，如是迅速，竟出人意料乏外，則因意國士兵，在國內時，多被騙赴阿比西尼亞工作，而半途强迫登岸，參加西國內亂之故。當意軍在瓜達拉迦拉慘敗之時，畢索里尼適在里比亞，聞訊大怒，即匆匆提前趕返本國，商議對付方法。意軍正規軍在西班牙指揮作戰的總司令Bergonzoh將軍曾因此而自殺。現西班牙政府軍方面更利用一極强的無綫電擴大放音器，裝在汽車上，開赴前綫，由國際自願軍意大利隊，擔任向前方宣傳，故意軍的逃亡，加入政府軍方面者，日有所聞，這是西亂十月來戰事情形的一個概略。</p>
<p>㊁一幕西戰不干涉委員會的把戲</p>
<p>自從西班牙內戰開始後，英法兩國，卽首先發起採取不干涉政策，雖經德意蘇俄葡等國贊同，在倫敦組織了所謂不干涉委員會，討論不干涉政策的實施。曾費了幾許唇舌，遷延了多少時間，才將各國禁止自願軍投赴西團作戰問題，取得德意的同意，於二月二十一日夜半起實行。（在這裏，不干涉委員會把個人自願參加與政府强迫的自願軍混成一例看待，眞是不分靑紅皂白了）。不過德意口是心非，並未切實遵守此項協定，自封禁以來，非但暗中仍繼續接濟叛軍軍火，尚以為未足，則更明白廠組利用軍艦，運送正式軍隊，三月初意軍又有六千，運抵西境，而最近德軍一千五百名，又由聖塞巴士梯安（Saint:Sebastien）上陸。意德兩國破壞不干涉協定，一而再，再而三了。但英法當局，明知德意此種行動，却假作痴聾，以為這種箭上弦，刀出鞘，一觸即發的國際法西斯戰爭火焰，惟有大家束手遠望此星星之戰火，現已籠罩於西國之上，只有堅决繼續此種不干涉政策，才可避免歐洲戰禍。第一步計劃，監察西國海陸邊界一事，因葡萄牙的反對，曾一再遲延，經過長時間的討論，總算戰勝多少困難，找得一個折衷辦法，終于於上月二十七日夜斗實行，將西國信封封鎖了。此項辦法，利弊得失，據各國人士的論調與過去的事實方面的分析，實在未可樂觀。且德意軍艦因實施監察，常駐在西政府現有的各處領海，倘一旦德決因叛軍戰事不利，惱羞成怒，則西政府沿海各大城，多有被轟炸的威脅。日前法國著名女作家，前小巴黎人報特派員（曾來過我國），西蒙納戴利女士公開演講，題為：“一個法國女子在瑪德里三星期的見聞錄”，講至凄慘之處，全塲聽衆，均為之淚下，中有云：馬拉加（Malaga）之役，難民二十萬，向邊境逃避，道為之塞，叛軍飛機五十架，不管老幼婦孺，用機槍來回掃射數十次，死傷者不計其數……接着，攻擊法國採取不干涉政策的無理大聲疾呼的說：台爾包斯先生！（法國外交部長）倘使你能親眼見到這種暴行慘景，我相信你也决不會繼續堅持着不干涉政策……蒙利女士最後憤怒的抗議的說道：西政府所缺少的是汽油車輛以運送難民汽油車輛並不是軍火何以也要受不干涉的限止呵！大家瞧瞧，這是不干涉政策所玩的把戲的結果了。</p>

<h3>傳訊證人程序已告完畢將從事調查票據</h3>
<p>再行宣示起訴或不起訴處分　吳盛代表律師當庭發表意見　流言傳聞指人犯罪殊失公允　一經紀人副會長邵文楣國另案被傳一</p>
<p>紗布交易所風潮發生後、經當局調查結果、指財政部稅務署長吳警鼎•蘇浙繞統稅局長暨昇願、涉有投機操機操縱、國犯到法一百三中國餘、“公務員假惜職務上之權力機會或方法、以故意犯本章以外各罪者、加重其刑至二分之一、但因公務員之身分、己特別規定其刑者、不在限限一、</p>
<p>交易所法</p>
<p>五十二條、“意閣變動交易所之市價、而數布流言、或行使詭計、或施暴行、或加脅迫者、盧二年以下之、徒刑、或六千元以下之前金”、做多送第一特區法院檢察盧偵查、業經宋根山檢察官、關第五法優作第四次偵查、所傳者紙彼偵查人吳儆鼎·盛昇願•”二人、而上海地方法院受理一件</p>
<p>凟職侵占</p>
<p>案、須向紗交經紀人副會長邵文楣訊問、故鄉託特一院傳訊、故今日邵亦被傳到庭、吳•盛•兩被偵查人、於九時前、各偕代理律師衆聯奎•童郁文•李晋孚。李鞏蔭、李國珍•到庭、而盛昇願另一律師馬濤華則未到、旁聽之男女，座為之滿、九時十分、宋檢察官即偕書記官升座、即傳盛昇願至案、活以凡犯罪之</p>
<p>證據不足</p>
<p>依法自不予起訴、即兩在交易所經營交易、若不與法律相抵觸、當亦無歸剈之理、故兩書可廣說、否則若將來經調查而得相當證據，反與兩不利、故須據實陳說、盛答以此次實無辜受累、庭上旋向盛詢問其兄弟姊妹間之情形，據乙就所問一一加以答復、調我共弟兄八人、姊妹八人、現存兄弟三人、姊妹三人、我</p>
<p>排行第七</p>
<p>姊妹為五小姐•七小姐•八小姐•其住所五小姐住巨發來斯路、七小姐往愚園路、八小姐住戈登路、其鬥牌均不明、五小姐之夫林維園、（諧音）已說離、七小姐之夫莊芝九、（諧者）經營商業、在某洋行辦事我父係於民國三四年間逝世、家產的數百萬、我等分家已二十餘年、五小姐•七小姐•作交易等、因分居多年、故均不知、她們經濟</p>
<p>各自獨立</p>
<p>每人約有數十萬財產、她們所做交易、是否濁做、抑屬合夥、均因未頋問而不知，我家之堂名為述善堂、安德生•董再孫•均不相識、此次實屬無辜受累、如各證人之證言、非屬傳聞、即屬推測、以莫頭有之事、加諸被告之身、殊攤公平、而以傳聞扒測、來指人犯罪、</p>
<p>實非公道</p>
<p>之舉、且我在交易所、絕對沒有做過交易、今旣受告發、應請庭上着告發人提出確證、若僅憑流言謠傳、殊難謂為平允云云、繼由庭上傳吳啟鼎至案、訊據供稱、我從未搬撾綿紗賣買、若僅馮處洽老所謂我以前做過、即據以認定我會做過紗花交易、殊非公尤辦法、且我亦屬率派調查紗交風潮人員之一、詎意將嫌疑</p>
<p>加諸我身</p>
<p>我官可不做、人尚須做、故精庭上主持公道徹底查明云云、宋檢察官核供、以本件關於傳訊證人程序、已告完畢、僅餘調查票據等事，故將來如無開庭必要、當不再開庭、即宣示起起或不超訴之處分、故即令被偵查人之律師、</p>
<p>發表意見</p>

<p>言談</p>
<h3>謹以民衆的力量為後盾</h3>
<p>— 穆初</p>
<p>自蘆溝橋事件發生以來，全國上下，極度憤概，二十九軍將士表示“蘆溝橋可為我人之填墓”於前，張自忠發表“姓張的决不做對不起民衆的事”於後，日本報章亦謂“中國抗日意識盛旺”。後方民衆更是踴躍輸將，通電慰勞，且有四川巴縣監獄全體囚民，十六日發出兩通電：（一）為絕食集資慰勞二十九軍守土將士；（二）電呈上峯請纓抗敵，並望派員編領，負弩前驅。電文中並有“囚等雖無公民之權利，實有國民之義務，愛國寸衷，不敢稍徒”等語。（中央社重慶十六日電）汪精衛先生之言曰：“人旣傷害於我們，我們不能不予以抵抗！”現在日電當局”决计不入縣甚華北之把持”的時候，即是無“公民之權利”的囚民，亦願書“國民之義務”，並且自願絕食集資慰勞守土將士，這種民衆一致的呼聲，我們所不能忽視者也。</p>
<p>但是消息傳來，冀察政務委員諸公却以地方事件的形式在和日人開所謂“和平”的談判，而於喜峯口曾建偉績的宋哲元亦於十五日發通電云：“此次蘆溝橋事件不幸發生，海內外各界同跑先後來電慰問，且有捐款勞軍之舉，熱誠贊助，全軍動員。此次事件，僅係局部衝突，傷亡亦少數，况國家養兵千日，用兵一時，效命疆傷，乃軍人之天職，軍隊平時有餉，戰時亦有軍事費，哲元以為遇此類小衝突即勞海內外同胞相助，各方盛意，雖甚殷感，而捐款則槪不敢受，倘將來國際大戰發生，全國動員，犧牲鉅大之時，再由國家統籌同胞捐肋，未為晚也。”養乓千日，用在一時，效命疆塲，乃軍人之天職，這是不必加以說明，大家都能知道的；軍隊平時有餉，戰時亦有軍事費，亦是大家都能知道的，不過海內外同跑之所以捐款勞軍，乃是表示後方民衆的愛國熱忱，亦即所謂“民氣”是也•這種實貴的精神總不能拒人於千里之外，而且於強敵壓境的時候，收受同胞的捐款，常亦不致“受之有愧”。此其一•又曰“此次事件僅係局部衝突一，這正好中了日人的圈套，在重兵包圍之中，償其蠶食之願。而所謂“和平”談判，能保得如冀察當局所嚴正表示的“决不犧牲國家主權”嗎？</p>
<p>全國上下已經一致奮起航敵救亡的高潮，同時衆所注意者，“皆集中於南京，是否準備軍事行動之問題”，（十六日中央路透電）現在或許就是“全國動員，犧牲鉅大之時”了！</p>
<p>在這一䯹十鈞之際，希望正如二十九軍駐滬辦事處叩詢的眞相所云：“對方曾派員與我方接洽，要求則有之，我方决不承認，刻下沿未成議，更無絲毫損失國權國土之事”。及宋氏覆孫宋杜楊諸公電中“本軍無一刻不在積極備戰。（十六日本埠消息）</p>
<p>謹以民衆的力量為後盾，决不能接受任何井正式的“和平”談判</p>
<h3>太平天國“金田村”觀後感</h3>
<p>— 李一</p>
<p>從“羅密歐與朱麗葉”到“武則天”，是一個進步，而從“武則天”到這“太平天國”的第一部“金田村”，又是一個進步。能進步，無疑是可喜的。</p>
<p>對於“太平天國”的史實，與我是和“武則天”同樣，祇能表示我的淺學，向請老道歉，不能提隻字。所以這一部戲裏所寫的，對於“太平天國”的史實是否有所歪曲，幾個領袖人物如洪秀全，　雲山，楊秀清等的性格，是否是成了作者的捏造，我祇能充一個讀者，準備拜讀對歷史有研究的專家們的大作。好在“太平天國離”現在並不遠，最近坊間出版的對於“太平天國”的文獻的書籍又很多，如果專家們對於戲並不看為雕虫小技，我想我這具願望總可以達到的。那麼，對於“太平天國”的史實卽使看到過一點鱗爪的紀載，又何敢“班門弄斧”</p>
<p>我是一個實利主義者，因之，對於一個一個　　演出，他的估價，我以為，就</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>應該從他的總和上去看。固然。如果批評，那就應該分析，這分析，最好是能有百分比，明察秋毫的給它一個公正而確切的估價；不過在觀衆這一方面分析這件工作大抵是在其次的，他們所看到得到的印象總是整個•我呢，不折不扣的正好是個觀衆，所以我的觀後感大教也祇能給“業實”諸公作一個備考的資料，以見“金田村”的演出，在某一種觀衆，是一種怎樣的感應耳。</p>
<p>關於“金田村”在目前上演的意義和它的客觀效果，我想可以先抄一些劇作者陳白塵先生的話在下面；“歷史劇是將歷史中某一個與現實生活有着關聯的題材予以正確的估價而藉藝術手腕使其重現，並不是單純的書本歷史的搬濱”，“我不承認它（指“金田村）所搬演的東西與現實生活沒有關聯也不承認它背棄時代，更不承認它迎合低級趣味的投機作品”！基於這樣的組纖，作者在第一幕中便告訴了我們說，“清廷卽割地賠款，因益加重苛捐雜稅，而貪官污吏，甚於強盜，衙差皂役，無異豺狼，“官副民反”，天下就“盜賊如毛”了”。“廣東廣西連年災荒，哀鴻遍野，富者創“團練”以自固，而貧民“客家”，飢寒交迫，呼籲無門，遂種下太平天國革命的根源”這樣的現象，以昔例今，是依舊存在的；尤可喜的是劇作者和導演者都很往意於羣衆的力量，把太平天國的勝利，歸之於這羣挺而走險的羣衆，而太平天國失敗的根源，則預伏於一二個“小人弄權”，幾十萬的羣衆則被朦在鼓中。這，不但是記錄了歷史，並且也是批判了歷史。（與歷史的眞實有否出入則應該是另一問題。）用這樣的創作態度來處理歷史劇，他的客觀效果與主觀的動機相一致，自然也有絕大可能。</p>
<p>這個戲使我第二個歡喜的原因，是角色性格的刻劃得分明，加之以導演與演員的認眞努力，就顯得更可愛。而尤可喜的，則是幾位新人的演技也並不弱於“老將”，例如飾余廷璋的舒強，飾李以文的金乃華，飾石達開的范萊，飾馬雲山的呂復等，這裏都有很優秀的成績，而使人更確信祇要用得適當，新人並不是不能演戲，至於“老將們”，則魏鶴齡，章曼蘋，英茵諸君都使我喜歡，陶金的戲，在我所看過的他的戲中，這也是應該是他是好的一個，雖然在第六幕中比較弱一點；趙丹在這裏演王秀才，戲不重，如果作為打消明星制度來看，那麼這也是應該值得嘉許的。</p>
<p>關於導演，戲的調子是很能和劇本諧和起來的，配以粗獷而不簡陋的舞毫裝置，越發有一種渾然雄厚的美，不過那支“打江山”的歌却還欠雄壯，聽起來，總覺得還缺少一種浩浩蕩蕩的震天動地的力；而有些地方，也許因為太注重於戲的緊湊，在到了高潮，却反而陪襯不大起來了，不過好在這還並不怎樣顯明，以一般來說，應該可說是很緊了的</p>
<p>至於照明，那在全國的劇團中，“業實”可以說是獨步了的，業餘的第三次公演使話劇在舞臺上見了天日，在這“金田村”裏，則更創造了閃電和虹，雖然閃電的光還欠快些，有幾次好像還使觀衆感到一頓，但由於熟練，演過幾塲之後大概是可以改正的。</p>
<p>不過，在黑明上，燈的位置則應該留意一點，不要讓觀衆見到才好，像“金田村”的第一塲，有一慕（那一幕記不起來了）裏，使人看到了頂燈（我坐在第七排），而在第六幕裏，也可以看到旁燈，這小小的疏忽，雖然一舉手便可改好，但給觀衆的印象，則殊去也。</p>
<h3>不容忽視任何一個力量</h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>有許多事情往往是出於不得已，並不就是本願的。就拿當漢奸的來說，又何當不是如此，决不會生成是漢奸的。不過話得說回來，那些喪心病狂，甘心為虎作倀的，自然應該別論。而這種實例很多，十五日本報天津通信載云：</p>
<p>“…駐津日軍司會部於六月中旬，已在日租界內祕密組織便衣隊，…招集流氓，施以訓練，每名每日發給生活費六角，及至本月七日深夜，蘆溝橋事件發生後，此項便衣隊約六百餘人，…按名發槍一枝，凖備出動，…旋因準備未妥，延至十二日晨三時許，始由少數先鋒出動，…我方保安隊有極鞏固單備，鳥合之便衣隊，當不敢輕凖，臨時改在南市廣善大街，釜律里附近小巷內，寶出便衣隊一小部，向華界鳴槍十餘響，幸我方保安隊警在益津里口，也有訪備，…該項便衣隊平素本為地痞流氓，不諳軍事，其根本目的，為騙取日人之金錢，絕無捨生之勇，連放數槍後，即抱頭竄去，…”</p>
<p>自然，他們不曾，也不會去估計這一件事的利害和輕重，但就說他們存心出賣，似乎太武斷了吧？他們根本不知道什麼，我們可以看出，使他們去應募的最大原因，是在追於生活。生活是最殘酷無情，某方看出這個破綻，聰明的把它利用着，類乎這種事，我們不知已看到多少次了。</p>
<p>但是，這並不是就沒有辦法，使他們不迫於生活，自然是一個最根本的辦法。而這問題却是如何重大，和難於懈決，然也是必煩角決。但問題也並不只是這樣簡單，重要的還在於喚醒他們，人畢竟是有人性的，使他們有了一個準確的認識，一定不會胡亂的去幹那沒廉恥的出賣勾當。從這裏，我們可以看出這一個工作，在目前是怎樣的切要，而它尤必煩要同實踐行動聯系起來。</p>
<p>在民族存亡開頭，我們要動員每一個份子，來合力救亡，而不容忽視每一個力量。使任何一個力量供敵人利用，是我們的過失，是對民族的一種損失。現在砲聲已在華北響起來了！我們要動員每一份子，决不能忽視任何一個力量，而削弱我們整個的力量，現在該是大家一致起來的時候了！</p>

<h3>My Government's Envoys Abroad Send Notes to the Nine-Power Treaty Signatories</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Invade Our Sovereignty and Violate International Treaties; Failure to Stop This in Time Will Endanger World Peace; My Government Is Willing to Resolve the Dispute Through Peaceful Means</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Dr. Wang Zhengting, today issued a memorandum to the U.S. Department of State. This document has also been submitted to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. It is reported that the content concerns the Chinese government possibly invoking the Nine-Power Treaty regarding the situation in North China. Ambassador Wang only stated, "China is prepared to take any peaceful measures." (Sixteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] It is not yet certain whether this document constitutes a formal invocation of the Nine-Power Treaty. However, the signatory countries have indeed undertaken to respect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The memorandum states that the sudden attack on Lugouqiao and the Japanese military's intrusion into North China clearly violate Chinese sovereignty and are in conflict with the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations Covenant. If such a situation is allowed to progress on its own, it will not only disrupt peace in East Asia but will also have unpredictable effects on the rest of the world. China has no choice but to use all its strength to defend its territory and national honor, but it is also prepared to resolve the dispute with Japan through all peaceful means of international law and treaties. Following his conversation with Hull, Wang Zhengting stated that he had discussed China's request for the United States and other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to take action regarding the crisis in the Far East. (Sixteenth Gan Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Chinese Ambassador to the United States, Wang Zhengting, personally delivered a note to Secretary of State Hull. The wording is identical to that of the Chinese government's simultaneous delivery to England, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Portugal, Russia, and Germany. The gist is that the actions of the Japanese army in North China are actually undermining the Washington Nine-Power Treaty of 1922, the Paris Peace Pact of 1928, and the Covenant of the League of Nations of 1919. It is asked that the State Department's experts are currently studying the note. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Chinese Ambassador to England, Guo Taiqi, today submitted a memorandum to British Foreign Secretary Eden, containing "the current situation of Japanese threats in North China." This document was also submitted to the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, except for Japan. The document was also submitted to Germany and Russia. It is faintly heard that the memorandum roughly states that if Japan's aggressive actions in China are allowed to go unchecked, it will not only disrupt peace in East Asia but will also plunge the entire world into an irrecoverable disaster. The Japanese military's attack on Lugouqiao is actually an infringement on Chinese sovereignty and a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations. (Sixteenth National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Jiang Tingfu, visited Litvinov yesterday and personally handed over the National Government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs' declaration on the situation in North China. The declaration stated that the Japanese military's sudden attack on Lugouqiao and the large-scale deployment of troops in North China are a blatant violation of Chinese sovereignty and a violation of the Nine-Power Treaty, the Paris Peace Pact, and the League of Nations Covenant. The Chinese government intends to resolve all disputes between China and Japan through peaceful means. Ambassador Jiang also stated that the same declaration has been sent to all signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. (Seventeenth TASS Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Germany today submitted a memorandum to the German Foreign Ministry. It is generally believed that this memorandum reiterates China's intention to resist Japanese aggression. It is reported that Chinese Ambassador Cheng Tianfang expressed the same opinion when he visited German Foreign Minister Neurath on Wednesday. Neurath stated that Germany is willing to maintain peace. Ambassador Cheng replied at the time that China is also willing to have peace, but this depends on Japan. If Japan continues to take military action in North China, China will have no choice but to resist forcefully. (Central News Agency, Seventeenth, Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] The note states, "The current disturbance occurred on the night of July 7th, at which time Japanese troops were conducting exercises. The initial point of conflict was in the Lugouqiao area. Japanese troops have no right to be there at all. Article 9 of the 1901 Boxer Protocol stipulates that the locations where foreign troops are stationed do not include Lugouqiao, Wanping County, and Fengtai. Japan's claim based on this treaty is already untimely and has no basis at all. Even according to the text of the Boxer Protocol, Japan has absolutely no reason to station troops and conduct exercises in these places... Under the pretext of demanding to search for a missing Japanese soldier within the defense perimeter of the Chinese army, the Japanese army attempted to forcibly enter Wanping County, where the Chinese army was stationed, at night, knowing that the Chinese army would definitely refuse. They deliberately did this in order to launch a further act of aggression against North China. This is obviously evident." The note continues, "Currently, there are over a hundred Japanese aircraft and approximately 20,000 soldiers concentrated near Beiping and Tianjin. The Chinese authorities have exhausted all means, even allowing both sides to withdraw troops, in the hope of stopping the hostilities. However, every time a solution is reached, it immediately becomes invalid due to the Japanese army's renewed attack." The note concludes by stating that the Chinese government believes that "this act of aggression" actually undermines the integrity of China's territorial sovereignty as stipulated in the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. If it is allowed to happen, it will have major consequences in Asia and throughout the world. On the Chinese side, we are still prepared to negotiate any honorable agreement, "but the National Government of China must closely control the basic conditions for a negotiated solution, fearing that intimidating local authorities and promoting the division of North China are the usual tactics of Japanese soldiers, which are well known to the world." (Central News Agency, Sixteenth, Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Authorities Reiterate Solemn Position</h3>
<p>Warfare Is Sufficient to Affect American Rights and Obligations; Opposition to Promoting Policy by Force; Interference in Other Countries' Internal Affairs Is Also Not Allowed</p>
<p>[Washington] U.S. Secretary of State Hull today issued a sternly worded warning, implying that China and Japan must not start a war in North China to avoid directly harming American interests. Although the article only reiterated American policy in forceful language, without directly naming China and Japan, its intent is self-evident as it was published at a time when the situation in North China was extremely critical. Hull's warning is straightforward and direct, one of the few such documents in recent years in the United States. It states, "Throughout the world, disturbances are not peaceful. People from all sides come to inquire about opinions or offer suggestions. The number is truly numerous. Any situation where armed conflict is already underway, or where there is a danger of armed conflict, is bound to cause the rights and obligations of all countries in the world to suffer serious threats. A serious armed conflict, no matter when or where it occurs, is bound to directly affect the rights and obligations of the United States. Therefore, I feel it is my duty to make the U.S. government's position known to the world. The United States is dedicated to safeguarding world peace and constantly innovating, sparing no effort. The United States also advocates avoiding the use of force to promote its policies and opposes interference in other countries' internal affairs." Hull also stated that the United States has consistently supported peaceful negotiations and faithfully fulfilling international agreements. All countries must respect the rights of other countries, and excessive trade barriers should also be reduced to achieve equality in commercial opportunities and limitations on international arms.

<h3>Tianjin Negotiations Face Numerous Difficulties</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Reportedly Involves Military Agreement; Political Solution to Be Discussed Later; Feng Zhiyuan and Others Take Extremely Firm Stance</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Zhang Zizhong and Zhang Yunrong are continuing to mediate. Feng Zhiyuan and Qin Dechun take an extremely firm stance. Currently, the Japanese army is distributed on the three sides of Pingxi, Pingnan, and Pingdong in preparation for occupying the area. There is no sound of gunfire in Pingjin today, but the diplomatic situation is extremely tense. (Eleventh hour, Tianjin Telephone of this newspaper)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Qi Xieyuan, Zhang Zizhong, Zhang Yunrong, and other important figures from Hebei and Chahar gathered at Qi's residence in the British Concession at 3:00 AM on the 17th for an all-night meeting to discuss ways to change the current situation.

<h3>US and French Authorities Meet Again with Chinese and Japanese Envoys</h3>
<p>Gu Weijun Issues Statement: Our Country Is Determined to Protect Its Territory</p>
<p>[Washington] Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed his opinion today, saying that the United States should act jointly with other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty. Based on past experience, he does not believe the United States should discuss matters concerning harm to China with China and Japan alone. In 1931, the United States sent a strongly worded note to Japan, urging it to respect China's territorial integrity, but Britain did not fully cooperate and merely sent a letter to Japan asking whether it intended to maintain the Open Door Policy in China. Japan immediately replied in the affirmative. Thereupon, the then British Foreign Secretary Simon declared in the House of Commons that Britain did not wish to be involved in the situation in the Far East. Looking back at Japan's reply in 1931, it stated that Japan's dispatch of troops to China to protect life and property did not violate the Nine-Power Treaty. China, as a signatory, naturally has the right to invoke the treaty and request full and frank consultations among the signatories when there is a danger of the treaty being violated. He has not yet decided whether today's memorandum from Ambassador Wang to Hull is a formal invocation of the treaty. When asked if the US Neutrality Act could be applied to China and Japan, Pittman replied that it could not at this time. Senator Borah stated that there is nothing in the Nine-Power Treaty that compels us to act. He will study the treaty and review the diplomatic history of the 1931 incident. (Central News Agency dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>[Washington] US officials recently stated that the United States' attitude towards the situation in the Far East has not changed as a result of visits by Chinese Ambassador to the US Dr. Wang Zhengting and Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Suma to Secretary of State Hull today. Secretary of State Hull still advocates for maintaining peace in the Far East and is strongly committed to it. Political figures in the United States say it is still unknown whether China and Japan will go to war or make peace. The United States must wait for the situation to develop before deciding whether to invoke the Washington Nine-Power Treaty. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Japanese Embassy Counselor Suma visited Secretary of State Hull today for talks. Afterwards, Suma told reporters that he had explained to Secretary of State Hull the reasons for Japan's "firm attitude" towards China. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

<p>[Paris] Foreign Minister Delbos met separately with Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Uchiyama, Chinese Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, and Soviet Ambassador to France Surits today to discuss the North China Incident. Afterwards, Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun issued a lengthy statement to Havas, saying that the Chinese government has informed all governments that China will not recognize any agreements concluded by local authorities in North China under duress from Japan without the approval of the central government. China is determined to resist by all means if Japan commits any further acts of encroachment on China's territorial sovereignty. He continued, "If northern China were to be controlled by Japan, it would become the prelude to a second Russo-Japanese War, and the impact would be unimaginable. Moreover, the fundamental principles of international law and international relations are now seriously threatened by Japan's attitude. China's independence is not only essential for maintaining the balance of power in East Asia, but also for maintaining the balance of power throughout the world. If Japan were to control China, not only would the vast interests of European and American countries in China be eliminated, but the danger to European and American colonies in Asia would also be extremely great."</p>
<p>In addition, Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Uchiyama told Havas that "there are good prospects for resolving the current dispute between China and Japan. Japan's protection of its interests in North China does not include military occupation of Beiping and Tianjin." He also said that Britain and France have not interfered diplomatically with the Japanese government, but have merely engaged in a form of contact based on humanitarianism. In France, it is rightly believed that peace in the Far East is a major condition for peace throughout the world. France has also applied to Japan and China in a friendly manner to maintain a moderate attitude. I am deeply impressed by France's impartial attitude and its full understanding of various issues in the Far East. We have the right to take the most appropriate "defensive" action if our people are "detained or mistreated," but this does not mean that the worst-case scenario is inevitable. In short, there is a possibility that the Chinese and Japanese authorities in North China will find a solution. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

<h3>American and French Newspapers Comment on the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>[Paris] Newspapers of both the left and right wings here continue to comment on the situation in the Far East, saying that the resistance Japan is encountering in North China is far greater than what it encountered in Manchuria previously. The Socialist Radical newspaper L'Œuvre stated that Article 7 of the Washington Nine-Power Treaty stipulates that the signatory powers should consult each other immediately when any situation arises that any one of them believes involves the application of the treaty. However, this provision may not be implemented, partly to avoid appealing to Italy and partly because European and American countries may not be willing to protest to Japan. On the contrary, "the main obstacle that Japan encounters in its rapid expansion into northern China is the rise of Chinese nationalism, the progress of the National Government, and the good reputation that outstanding elements of the new China have earned in countries around the world. The first result of this situation is that the new Chinese army, equipped with new weapons, is determined to defend the National Government and will not allow Japanese aggression." It is believed that Japan intends to start locally and gradually devour all of China to avoid a large-scale war. The Communist newspaper L'Humanité stated that the existing balance of power of the Pacific nations is no longer favorable to Japan for three reasons: (1) China has been unified, (2) there is progress in the anti-fascist movement within Japan, and (3) the Soviet Union is strong. The Socialist Radical newspaper L'Ère Nouvelle stated that Japan's attitude is endangering not only China but also the Soviet Union, "especially since the Soviet Union is committed to peace and has recently received clear proof of this (referring to the Heilongjiang incident)." The right-wing newspaper L'Ordre warned Japan not to act rashly, saying that if it does, the diplomatic achievements that Japan has gained in the last fifteen years will be diminished. "Other countries, especially the great powers, have also engaged in annexation, but their digestive power has not yet recovered," it said. (Havas dispatch from Central News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>[New York] Regarding the Lugouqiao Incident, major newspapers in New York published articles commenting on the 14th and 15th. The New York Times said that advocating that this conflict is a local event and advocating that the Nanjing central government should not interfere is a long-standing excuse for Japan to undermine China's territorial integrity. Japan's claim to develop the rich resources of North China is also a form of aggression. The current Konoe cabinet, with its so-called free will, is clearly controlled by the Japanese military. Regardless of what Japan's policy goals are, they have strengthened the self-defense of the Chinese people and made it difficult for European and American opinion to sympathize with them. The New York World Telegram commented that the Japanese army's night exercises in Chinese territory this time are reminiscent of the mischief that the Japanese made in 1931. Their proposed joint anti-communist defense in North China further shows their desire to open the gates of North China and allow their troops to run rampant. The New York Herald Tribune said that the fate of China today is only two paths: either watching the Chinese provinces fall one after another, or defending themselves by force.

<h3>Taixu Sends Telegram to Japanese Buddhists</h3>
<p>Guling. Master Taixu of Dalin Temple in Guling sent a telegram to all Japanese Buddhists. The telegram reads: To the Japanese Buddhist Federation at Zojoji Temple in Shiba Park, Tokyo, please forward to all Buddhist followers and military and civilians. Recently, the Sino-Japanese conflict has reached an extremely dangerous point, which will plunge the Chinese and Japanese peoples into years or decades of mutual strife and killing, ultimately leading to Japan's suicide and leaving the Earth in a tragic disaster. It is time to rein in at the precipice, quickly stop all military actions, and seek a path to understanding through equal diplomacy, so that the Chinese and Japanese peoples can ultimately truly join hands and open up the era of great unity for humanity. Whether this can be achieved depends on whether Japan can ring the bell and untie the knot. I know that there are many outstanding people in Japanese Buddhism, and more than half of the people are Buddhist believers. Now is the time to greatly open your compassionate hearts and enlightened eyes to save yourselves and others. I urge the Council to examine and implement this and send a telegram in reply. Taixu respectfully requests, news. (Special dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>On the Spirit of Science</h3>
<p>— Xu Xusheng</p>
<p>Science is not merely an accumulation of research results; it is a method. Furthermore, to be more precise, it is not just a method, but a spirit. This is because its methods can be constantly improved, but its spirit remains eternally unchanged. What is this spirit? To explain it in detail would naturally be a complex and endless task, but to speak of it roughly, it is quite simple and clear, and anyone with a sound mind can fully accept it. What is this simple and clear principle? It is that we must use our own eyes to see, our own ears to hear... use our own senses to feel, and our own reason to deduce. These few words have two aspects: First, what we use must all be our own, not others'. It is neither that of the ancients, nor that of foreigners. To demolish the city walls near Xuanwu Lake for no reason, and then, upon hearing the protests from those with high noses and round eyes who claimed that the scenic beauty of Xuanwu Lake depended entirely on the contrasting backdrop of the ancient city walls, to quickly halt the demolition work; this is an example of not using one's own eyes to see. Because in the past, women in our country did not ascend to the upper floors of theaters, the actors who impersonated women created a strange, artificial voice. From then on, this erroneous practice spread, and everyone competed to imitate it, regarding it as the proper sound, to the point where female singers also imitated this sound. No one ever asked: When did any natural-born woman, singing at the top of her lungs, produce such a strange sound? -- The *Zhengsheng* sound in Peking opera is not far from the natural voice and cannot be generalized. -- This is an example of not using one's own ears to listen. Lacking deep sympathy and careful observation of the natural world and human society, but instead indulging in the squabbles of the Literary Anthology School, the Tang School, the Song School, or the Romantic School, the Naturalist School, etc., shouting wildly about "moons and rainbows, flowers and whatnot"; that is failing to use one's own senses to feel. Because foreign countries have auditing systems, we simply copied them, without understanding how the institutions of an industrial and commercial society could be applied to an agricultural society! In the end, if some fool actually tried to report and account for expenses truthfully, there would be no way to avoid being refuted! To the point where the wise, the foolish, the cheaters, and those who spent honestly, no one dared not "do" something when it came to expense reports! Superiors and subordinates deceive each other to comply with an auditing system that is completely incompatible with the social situation! This is the result of not daring to use one's own reason to deduce. -- Please do not misunderstand me when I say this: I am not saying that the auditing system should be abolished, nor am I saying that our old auditing system is superior to the current one. I am simply saying that societies with different economic conditions should have different auditing systems. Blindly copying others is useless. In our country today, education, the judiciary, and other social systems, almost all commit the same error. For decades, many disputes in society have arisen from those who studied in France copying the feelings and reasoning of the French, and those who studied in Germany copying the feelings and reasoning of the Germans, refusing to carefully study what our country's society is actually like, only grasping a superficial understanding, and shouting nonsense without matching their noses to their mouths. -- The second meaning of these words is that when we look, we should use our own eyes, and not other senses or psychological functions. By analogy, those who use their ears as eyes make many laughable mistakes. Walking in the wilderness at dusk, seeing a withered tree, because it is hazy and unclear, using one's own fearful emotions and imagination to supplement it, turning it into a terrifying phantom; that is also not fully utilizing the function of the eyes, but replacing them with other psychological functions, leading to very strange misperceptions. Unwilling to pay attention to the universally valid and undeniable principles in logic and methodology, only picking up fragments of feeling to defend bizarre theories; that is also not using one's own reason to deduce, but instead using incomplete feelings to replace it, which will also lead to an incurable academic attitude. Of course, human senses are often deceiving, and if you want to make it a basis for precise knowledge, you often need to use excellent equipment to assist it and correct it. Moreover, human senses are extremely limited. For example, if a sound wave is above or below a certain number, our hearing will not be able to sense it at all. Sometimes, with the help of machinery, we can perceive things that our original senses could not perceive. For example, due to advances in optics, we can sense ultraviolet and infrared rays that we never knew existed. But, no matter what, all of this is using our own efforts to maximize our own senses. Our seeing still has to use our own eyes, our hearing still has to use our own ears... our reasoning still has to use our own reason. All of these psychological abilities should assist each other, but they cannot replace each other. The great effectiveness of using one's own senses to feel and using one's own reason to deduce can be easily illustrated with a few examples: The development of Russian literature has only a history of two hundred years, and they are very close to the advanced Western European literary countries, making it very convenient to follow in their footsteps. However, the great Russian writers of the nineteenth century, such as Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, were certainly influenced by Western European literature, but their way of feeling was different. The profound emotions they possessed for all of humanity were something that Western European writers lacked. Therefore, although their history is very short and they were greatly influenced by the Western European literary world, they were able to bring out their own unique elements, which caused a great shock in the European literary scene. The development of Chinese literature has a history of several thousand years, but there are still no works that have caused a great shock in the world literary scene. In the last one or two decades, everyone has been diligently following in others' footsteps, and there has been considerable success, but works that can shake the world literary scene do not seem likely to be produced in the near future. The reasons for this are naturally complex, but the main reason is that Russian writers "dare" and are "able" to feel with their own senses, while Chinese writers, until now, do not seem to dare very much, and whether they can is even more difficult to say. The European Renaissance was originally just a revival movement, but after studying it for a short time, it was discovered that the Greek way of thinking was precise but empty. Following them completely would not lead to any major results. So, they bravely and diligently blazed their own trails, creating the modern empirical school, and only then did Western culture experience a great development in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. This is also the result of being able to use one's own reason to deduce. Now, if our academic circles have no desire to make any achievements, then it is over. If we still want to make some achievements, then we must clarify this basic point: Following the purely Chinese viewpoint of those who advocate Chinese learning as the essence and Western learning for practical application will naturally not work. Following the purely Western viewpoint of those who advocate complete Westernization will also inevitably lead to a dead end! They have the old Chinese ways as a backing on one side, and the new Western ways as support on the other. That is naturally very convenient for those of us who lean eastward and then fall westward. The path we advocate, relying on our own reason, without support or reliance, going alone, is very difficult and inconvenient. However, convenience is one thing, and success is another. All those who have truly succeeded have come from very difficult paths. Mother Nature probably does not like lazy sons, so she is unwilling to give them easy paths to take, but uses all kinds of distressing methods to temper them, to see if they have the courage to break through the obstacles she has deliberately set up! Only those who have such courage can be considered Mother's worthy children, and are worthy of Mother's favor! This is an iron law of history, and no exception has ever been seen! So, where should we go from here?</p>
<h3>China's Trade with the US Sees Growing Development</h3>
<p>Exports Exceeded 50 Million Yuan Last Month, Trade Surplus This Year Could Reach 60 Million</p>
<p>[Washington] The Department of Commerce announced today that China's exports to the United States have flourished by the end of May this year, resulting in significant profits for China's foreign trade. Experts believe that the majority of these profits have been used to increase China's deposit balances in New York and other Pacific ports. Based on current exchange rates, China's trade surplus with the US this year could reach 60 million US dollars. By the end of May this year, the United States imported $51,653,000 from China, an increase of 39% compared to last year. US exports to China were $26,256,000, an increase of 60% compared to last year. Remittances from overseas Chinese in the United States and various Asian ports have also increased, especially in the rubber, tin mining, and sugar-producing regions. China's financial position is quite strong, as most imports are secured by credit, with little cash outflow. China is able to pay important bonds on time and maintain considerable foreign deposits. By the end of May this year, the United States imported $93,392,000 from Japan, compared to $67,787,000 in the same period last year. US exports to Japan were $140,325,000, compared to $79,415,000 last year. During the same period, the United States imported $34,559,000 from the Philippines, compared to $24,528,000 in the same period last year. US exports to the Philippines were $55,346,000, compared to $43,474,000 last year. In May, the US imported $7,548,000 from the Philippines, compared to $5,153,000 in the same month last year. In the same month, the Philippines imported $15,213,000 from the US, compared to $2,269,000 in the same month last year. In the week ending May 9, the United States imported $61,347,712 in gold and exported $35,352, indicating a large inflow of gold. During the same week, the United States imported $1,024,407 in silver and exported $62,526. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3>Air Defense Drills in Two Major British Ports</h3>
<p>Extremely Precise</p>
<p>[London] The sirens wailed incessantly in the ports of Southampton and Portsmouth at midnight today, marking the prelude to the most sophisticated air raid drills ever held in Britain. The entire port was blacked out, including the lights of ships and cars within the port. Residents delayed going to bed and crowded into shelters. Simulated gas bombs and incendiary bombs fell in the streets. Telephone operators and other key personnel wore gas masks. "The dead and wounded" were rushed to aid stations by rescuers. Fire brigades were engaged in dealing with imaginary fires. Air Minister Sir Philip Sassoon flew in and observed the work of the gas defense teams, rescue teams, and fire brigades on the scene, along with Air Vice-Marshal Game, the head of the Metropolitan Police, and many town police chiefs.

<p>First, the friendly relations between the Soviet Union and Turkey, established ten years ago, have been further consolidated through the signing of various border and multilateral treaties and agreements. To this day, after all international changes, they remain as perfect as ever, and their full value to the interests of both sides has been affirmed and proven.</p>

<h3>Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet Naval Agreements Signed</h3>
<p>Soviet Russian Far East Fleet Not Restricted. Anglo-American-French Naval Treaty Extended</p>
<p>[London] Great Britain signed naval agreements separately with Russia and Germany today. As a result, the 1936 Anglo-American-French London Naval Treaty has been expanded to include Russia and Germany. Signatories to today's naval agreement were Foreign Minister Eden and First Lord of the Admiralty Cooper for the British side, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop for the German side, and Russian Ambassador to Britain Maisky and the Soviet Russian naval attache for the Russian side. Currently, the Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet naval agreements still need to be ratified by the British, German, and Russian governments. The agreements will take effect simultaneously with the London Naval Treaty after the exchange of ratification documents. On the British side, the London Naval Treaty still needs to be passed by Parliament. The bill will give the government the authority to prohibit shipyards from building ships beyond the limits of the treaty. Foreign orders for arms must be reported to the government at any time. The bill will be presented for a second reading on the 20th of this month, and its passage seems unlikely to be a problem. In addition, France and the United States have already notified their approval. The British Dominions and the Indian government must also approve it. It is said that all formalities do not seem to be a problem. Around the end of July, the London Naval Treaty and other bilateral agreements can be implemented simultaneously. The Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet bilateral agreements are generally not much different from the London Naval Treaty, with only slight modifications in a few points to suit the special circumstances of Germany and Russia. Although the negotiations were conducted at the same time, the agreements were signed separately. Unfortunately, the provision in the London Naval Treaty that the gun caliber of battleships should not exceed 14 inches could not be suspended due to Japan's opposition. Therefore, this clause is no longer in the naval treaty and the Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet bilateral agreements. However, in view of the special situation in the Far East, the Soviet Russia declared during the negotiations that it would make appropriate reservations regarding the position in the Far East. Therefore, the Anglo-Russian agreement also stipulates that the warships built by Soviet Russia for use in the Far East are exempt from the obligation to report their contents. The Soviet Russia can also, after notifying the British government, not abide by the qualitative restrictions in the treaty in the Far East, and there is no need to take the procedures stipulated in Article 25 of the London Treaty. The Soviet Russian fleet had been allowed to decline since the end of the European War, and now it is being rebuilt. Therefore, the Soviet Union believes that it should build several cruisers outside the limits of the naval treaty. For this practical reason, Soviet Russia can equip its new cruisers with 7-inch gun positions instead of 6-inch ones. Great Britain will now hold consultations with the Scandinavian countries, Turkey, and Poland, in order to sign the same bilateral treaties with these countries.

<h3>German Political Circles Attach Great Importance</h3>
<p>Accepting Both Qualitative and Quantitative Restrictions at the Same Time, Claiming It Proves Germany's Desire for Peace</p>
<p>[Berlin] German political figures attach great importance to the signing of the Anglo-German naval agreement, believing that it is a contribution of Germany to curbing the preparation of competition, and is sufficient to prove Germany's desire for peace. It can also be seen from the fact that the method of resolving problems through bilateral negotiations is easier to achieve results. Moreover, Germany is now participating in accepting qualitative restrictions on the navy that have been accepted by other countries. Moreover, Germany is the only country that has accepted quantitative restrictions after the expiration of the Washington Naval Treaty. It is said that the German fleet is purely defensive. (Central News Agency, Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>[London] The Anglo-German Naval Agreement includes the following three clauses: ㊀ Concluding a "qualitative agreement," both countries mutually guarantee to notify each other of matters such as tonnage and cannon caliber before building new ships; ㊁ Publishing an agreement to supplement the 1935 Naval Treaty; ㊂ Exchanging notes regarding the construction of the large cruiser "Holiday." According to the Anglo-German Naval Treaty of June 18, 1935, the German Navy should not exceed 35% of the British Navy in terms of tonnage, but no regulations were made on the type of warships and the size of the caliber, because the signatories to the London Naval Treaty (1930) were in the process of negotiating. Germany therefore announced that it was willing to conclude a bilateral agreement with Great Britain to resolve these issues. After Great Britain, France, and the United States concluded the naval treaty, Anglo-German and Anglo-Soviet bilateral negotiations proceeded until the agreement was signed today. The detailed contents of the three clauses are as follows: ㊀ The qualitative agreement stipulates that the size of warships is 35,000 tons, the caliber of the cannons is 40.6 cm, the maximum size of aircraft carriers is 23,000 tons, and the cannon caliber must not exceed 15.5 cm; large cruisers are 10,000 tons, the cannon caliber is 20 cm, small cruisers are 8,000 tons, the cannon caliber is 15.5 cm, destroyers below 3,000 tons must not be equipped with cannons with a caliber of more than 15.5 cm, the maximum size of submarines must not exceed 3,000 tons, and the caliber is 15.5 cm; ㊁ It is stipulated that the construction holiday for Class A cruisers ends on January 1, 1947, and can be shortened if Soviet Russia moves forward; ㊂ If a special event occurs, this agreement can be reconsidered, just like the 1936 Anglo-French-American Naval Treaty; ㊃ The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is valid until the end of 1942.

<p>Endeavoring to Preserve the Non-Intervention Policy, and Inviting South American Countries to Participate</p>
<p>[London] The Non-Intervention Committee on the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session today and unanimously passed the British government's proposal as a suitable basis for discussion. The non-intervention policy has thus been extended. The British plan stipulates filling the gaps in the supervisory system and continuing the non-intervention policy. It has now been handed over to a subcommittee for discussion. The subcommittee will convene on Tuesday morning. At today's meeting, after Lord Plymouth, the chairman, quietly explained the British plan to the attendees, the committee members resolved to accept it in principle. However, several members reserved the right to propose amendments in the subcommittee. German representative Ribbentrop and Italian representative Grandi both praised the British government's thorough planning and declared that their governments were willing to recognize the British plan as a basis for discussion. Ribbentrop agreed to proceed quickly and therefore advocated that the plan be transferred to the subcommittee for handling immediately. French representative Corbin firmly stated that the French government insisted that the withdrawal of volunteers and the recognition of belligerent rights should be interdependent and not separated. Soviet representative Maisky reserved the right to propose amendments but also accepted the plan as a basis for discussion. The Portuguese ambassador stated that when the supervision of the French-Spanish border was restored, Portugal also intended to re-establish supervisors on its border. The chairman then spoke, urging everyone to do their utmost to ensure that this proposal would take effect as soon as possible. The British government deeply appreciates the efforts of all countries to jointly seek solutions to difficulties. The meeting was then adjourned.</p>
<p>When the chairman presented the British proposal, he stated that the proposal aimed to provide a solution that, even if not completely satisfactory to all parties, could be accepted by all. The British government firmly believes that this proposal does not give undue weight to any party's opinion. As a whole, this proposal is the best practical solution in the current situation. The committee is of course free to discuss and make necessary amendments. However, the British government closely believes in each item of the proposal, believing that if one of them is deleted or significantly altered, it will hinder other parts. The primary purpose of this proposal is to restore the supervisory system in accordance with the methods implemented before the withdrawal of German and Italian warships from patrolling. To achieve this goal, it is proposed that personnel be stationed in Spanish ports. These officials will only report the names and nationalities of ships arriving in the ports to the committee, indicating whether the ship carries a supervisor or has been granted an exemption from having one. Other supervisors will continue to perform their duties on board as they currently do. Therefore, the British government proposes that the supervision of the land border of Spain should also be handled on the same basis as before. The second purpose of this proposal is to strengthen the supervisory system in various ways and attach several practical conditions, allowing both warring parties to enjoy belligerent rights, but only after the satisfactory progress of the withdrawal of volunteers and the actual progress of the withdrawal is recognized. The Spanish war has been going on for several months. Its nature in an unusual situation is sufficient to be considered a war between belligerents. However, the situation does not conform to the usual rules. Since the non-intervention agreement has established a mechanism to prevent the transportation of arms and ammunition to all parties, the right to search at sea does not need to be implemented. As for the foreign volunteers fighting on both sides in Spain, their numbers are very large. Therefore, it is difficult to expect the governments concerned to view them as Spanish soldiers, not bound by foreign countries, and to consider them as part of a civil war in which all countries are neutral according to ordinary international principles. The British government therefore stipulates that the recognition of belligerent rights should be conditional on the withdrawal of these volunteers. Furthermore, when the United Kingdom and France pay attention to the four naval powers, and jointly implement patrol duties on the Spanish sea according to the agreement, it can be hoped that they will be able to deal with the naval difficulties that often occur during naval operations between the two naval powers, and prevent the occurrence of danger through joint action. Now that this kind of maritime unity is no longer possible, governments with maritime responsibilities must seek the best way to avoid their ships from being involved in unfortunate events. The British government believes that the committee should discuss the precise conditions so that the limited recognition of belligerent rights can be implemented. It is confident that with the cooperation and goodwill of the committee members, satisfactory detailed measures can be agreed upon. The chairman concluded by saying that it is urgent to reach a compromise and ensure the continued implementation of the non-intervention policy. The attendees recalled that the members of the previous committee had all reaffirmed their willingness to comply with this policy. (Central News Agency, 16th, Reuters)</p>
<p>[London] The Adjustment Committee for the Non-Intervention in the Spanish Civil War held a plenary session at 4 p.m. today. Representatives from all countries accepted the British compromise plan as a basis for discussion. The meeting ended at 5 p.m. The subcommittee is now scheduled to meet next Tuesday to review this plan. After the Adjustment Committee meeting this afternoon, French Ambassador Corbin spoke first, stating that before the issue of recognizing the parties involved in the Spanish Civil War as belligerents is put to discussion, the following two issues should be effectively resolved first: 1. Sending neutral country inspectors to monitor Spanish ports; 2. Withdrawing volunteers from all countries. (Central News Agency, 16th, Havas)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the non-intervention issue in the Spanish Civil War, the member states of the Adjustment Committee have accepted the compromise plan proposed by the British government yesterday as a basis for discussion. The representative of Italy also proposed inviting South American countries to participate. The British government then inquired with the embassies of Brazil and Chile about the opinions of their governments. At the same time, the British ambassador to Brazil will directly negotiate with the Brazilian government. According to reports, the ambassadors of Argentina, Brazil, and Chile to the United States recently met at the request of the Peruvian ambassador to discuss whether South American countries should participate in the Adjustment Committee.

<h3>A Perspective on the Spanish Civil War (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— (French Correspondence)</p>
<p>㊀Overview of the Civil War</p>
<p>The Spanish Civil War has been going on for almost a year since it broke out on July 18 last year. The rebel General Franco has received assistance from the world's dictatorships, Germany and Italy. He has no worries about various important military equipment and airplanes. Germany and Italy have also sent large numbers of regular troops to participate in the war, which has led to the prolongation of the war, and a victory or defeat has not yet been determined. When the rebellion began, the Spanish government relied entirely on the people as its support, hastily arming and participating in the fight against the rebel army. These popular troops, because they had not been trained in peacetime, and because the organization was complex with many different names and orders that could not be unified, had these two shortcomings, which led to repeated defeats in the war against the rebel army. In the Battle of Irun, it was lost because of a lack of ammunition (a train of ammunition, departing from Barcelona, was detained in French territory because the non-intervention policy had been implemented). In the Battle of Badajoz, according to a Reuters reporter's report, about 4,000 members of the government's militia were captured and massacred by the rebel army, and the entire wall was stained red with blood. The Spanish government deeply realized that the defeats in the two battles were not due to the inability of the soldiers to fight, but to the defects in the organization and unified command of the army, and specifically reorganized the army to unify command. The anti-fascist people of the world have also gone to Spain one after another to form the so-called International Volunteer Army to participate in the fighting on the Madrid side (a Chinese expatriate in Paris joined the team, specializing in rescue matters, bravely moving forward, and has rescued many injured people, which is greatly praised by the international team). However, in terms of military equipment, it has not been as sufficient and complete as the German and Italian armies, and the number of people is also smaller, which led to the fact that Madrid almost fell twice between November last year and February this year, but it was able to turn danger into safety, which cannot but be attributed to the merits of General Miaja, the commander-in-chief of the Madrid defense forces. Now the government army on the Madrid side has turned from defense to offense, and is winning victories everywhere and making progress. But why can the government army suddenly turn defeat into victory? The biggest reason for this is that the Italian army in charge of attacking Guadalajara in the northeast of the capital of Spain had no fighting spirit, was defeated in one battle, and retreated continuously (more than 1,000 people were captured, including many battalion and regimental commanders). The defeat of the Italian army was so rapid that it was beyond expectation, because many Italian soldiers were deceived into going to Abyssinia to work, and were forcibly landed halfway and forced to participate in the Spanish civil war. When the Italian army was defeated in Guadalajara, Mussolini was in Libya, and was furious when he heard the news, and hurriedly returned to his country ahead of schedule to discuss countermeasures. General Bergonzoh, the commander-in-chief of the Italian regular army fighting in Spain, committed suicide as a result. Now the Spanish government army is also using a very powerful wireless radio amplifier, installed on a car, and driven to the front line, where the Italian team of the International Volunteer Army is responsible for propaganda to the front, and it is heard that the intentional army is deserting and joining the government army. This is a general overview of the situation of the war in the ten months since the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>㊁A Farce by the Spanish Civil War Non-Intervention Committee</p>
<p>Since the Spanish Civil War began, the United Kingdom and France were the first to launch a non-intervention policy. Although Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, Portugal, and other countries agreed, the so-called Non-Intervention Committee was organized in London to discuss the implementation of the non-intervention policy. It took a lot of talk and delayed a lot of time before Germany and Italy agreed to the issue of prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain to fight, which was implemented from midnight on February 21. (Here, the Non-Intervention Committee treats individual volunteers and government-forced volunteers as the same thing, which is really indistinguishable). However, Germany and Italy did not sincerely abide by this agreement. Since the ban, not only have they secretly continued to provide the rebel army with military supplies, but they have also felt that it was not enough, and then they made it clear that they used warships to transport regular troops. At the beginning of March, another 6,000 Italian troops were transported to Spain, and recently 1,500 German troops landed from Saint-Sebastien. Germany and Italy have violated the non-intervention agreement again and again. However, the British and French authorities, knowing that Germany and Italy were acting in this way, pretended to be deaf and dumb, thinking that this international fascist war flame, which was on the string and ready to be launched, could only be avoided by everyone standing aside and watching the sparks of war, which has now enveloped Spain, and only by resolutely continuing this non-intervention policy can the European war be avoided. The first step plan, the matter of monitoring the sea and land borders of Spain, was repeatedly delayed due to Portugal's opposition. After a long period of discussion, it finally overcame many difficulties and found a compromise, and finally implemented it at night on the 27th of last month, sealing off Spain's envelope. The advantages and disadvantages of this method, according to the discussions of people from various countries and the analysis of past facts, are really not optimistic. Moreover, German and Italian warships are stationed in the existing territorial waters of the Spanish government to implement monitoring. If Germany decides to become angry because the rebel army's war is unfavorable, the major coastal cities of the Spanish government are threatened by bombing. A few days ago, a famous French female writer, a former special correspondent of the Petit Parisien (who had been to China), Ms. Simone Téry, gave a public lecture entitled: "A French Woman's Record of Three Weeks in Madrid." When she talked about the tragic situation, all the listeners in the hall were in tears. She said: In the Battle of Malaga, 200,000 refugees fled to the border, and the road was blocked. 50 rebel planes repeatedly strafed back and forth with machine guns, regardless of the old, the young, the women, and the children, and the number of dead and injured was countless... Then, she attacked France's unreasonable implementation of the non-intervention policy and loudly exclaimed: Mr. Delbos! (French Foreign Minister) If you could see this kind of atrocities with your own eyes, I believe you would never continue to adhere to the non-intervention policy... Ms. Monley finally angrily protested: What the Spanish government lacks is gasoline vehicles to transport refugees. Gasoline vehicles are not military supplies. Why should they also be subject to the restrictions of non-intervention! Take a look, this is the result of the tricks played by the non-intervention policy.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters and Other Groups Send Telegrams of Encouragement to Song Zheyuan and Others</h3>
<p>Telegram from the Municipal Party Headquarters</p>
<p>To Mr. Song Mingxuan, Chairman of Tianjin, Upon hearing that there is talk in Tianjin of accepting the enemy's conditions, the news reports must not be true. We have always known that you, sir, prioritize righteousness and national interests, and take the protection of national sovereignty and the revival of the nation as your own responsibility. You have also compared yourself to Guo Ziyi and Zeng Guofan, so it is known that you would never want to risk the world's great disapproval and destroy your glorious history. However, today's affairs are clearly a matter of right and wrong, obedience and disobedience. Unification is what the country seeks, and division is what the enemy hopes for. The enemy's benefit is our harm. The enemy has always wanted to transform Hebei, Chahar, and Eastern Hebei, placing the two provinces outside the map of China. You, sir, as the head of the two provinces, have the responsibility to defend the territory and protect the country. You can fully serve the country, or you can die to repay the country. There is no room for humiliation or luck. Moreover, North China is the North China of all China, not just the matter of one or two provinces, let alone the matter of one or two people. You, sir, must follow the will of the central government and the trend of public opinion, and carefully respond, resolutely deciding based on the rights of the whole country, and never rashly decide based on the private opinions of one or two people, sacrificing national rights and the lives of the people. Moreover, the Northeast died without a fight, while Suiyuan was fully defended by resisting. The past is not far away, and it can serve as a warning. It can be known that hard work often has the possibility of victory, and humiliation has no chance of survival. With your wisdom, sir, how could you not know this? Now the people of the country regard you, sir, as Guo Ziyi and Zeng Guofan, and also hope that you, sir, will be Guo Ziyi and Zeng Guofan to protect national rights and preserve your reputation. We are eagerly looking forward to your telegram and hope that you will send us a telegram at any time so that we can quell the rumors. Sincerely, the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters,</p>
<p>Seamen's Groups</p>
<p>In the bloody battle on the Great Wall the year before last, righteousness shocked the sky. Now the bandits have entered Tianjin and intend to sweep everything away.

They are all willing to fulfill their oath to die for the country and fight for the survival of the nation. They have asked to be sent to the war zone to serve. The alumni association of the group plans to contact the Red Cross first, and then decide whether to go to the front line to serve depending on the situation. It is also learned that the Shanghai branch of the China Boy Scouts Friendship Association held an emergency meeting of all cadres yesterday, convened by the president of the association, and passed a resolution to form a battlefield service team.

Liu Wang Liming was elected as the chairman. The general manager, Xu Jianping, reported on the association's affairs for the past month, as well as the situation of disaster relief for children. It was briefly stated that the association's deputy general manager, Chen Tiesheng, flew to Chongqing on June 16th to discuss disaster relief for children in various regions with all sectors of society. Four shelters have been established one after another, located in Chongqing, Zigong, Santai, and Jiange, respectively. It is estimated that Chongqing can accommodate 1,000 children, Zigong and Jiange can each accommodate 300 children, and Santai can accommodate 500 children. The organization of each shelter is based on a committee system, specifically accommodating disaster-stricken children under the age of 16, limited to those who are extremely poor and destitute. In addition to providing food, clothing, and shelter, appropriate education will be given. The duration of operation is tentatively set for one year. After the work in Sichuan Province is completed, they will fly to Gansu and Shaanxi to continue inspecting the disaster situation. Furthermore, since the association began soliciting donations for disaster relief, it has received over 10,000 yuan from various sectors. The Ministry of Finance allocated 50,000 yuan, and the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association allocated 40,000 yuan. It is also reported that the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau will allocate approximately 3,000 yuan from the donation funds of primary schools to the association. Of the 40,000 yuan allocated by the Sichuan Disaster Relief Association, 25,000 yuan has been allocated to Chongqing and 15,000 yuan to Zigong. Currently, the donation campaign is still ongoing.

<p>Li Guang'an Discusses Rumors of Ji-Cha Listening to the Central Government and Clarifies That All Are Enemy Slanders, Explaining the True Meaning of Refusing Donations - Xin Sheng News Agency Reported that Li Guang'an, Director of the 29th Army's Shanghai Office, said yesterday morning that all kinds of rumors circulating outside regarding the Ji-Cha authorities are absolutely unfounded. He also confirmed this with a telegram from Qin Dechun and others last night, which briefly stated that the various rumors circulating outside are actually attempts to sow discord and confuse public opinion, not worthy of a scholar's smile, and therefore absolutely unbelievable. These remarks are nothing more than slander and injury by the Japanese side, intending to divide the internal unity of Ji-Cha and separate the connection between Ji-Cha and the central government. He hopes that public opinion will encourage them at all times. If one lightly believes unfounded rumors, it will fall right into the Japanese scheme. In short, from Chairman Song down, the entire Ji-Cha authorities, and the entire 29th Army are all determined to dedicate themselves to the country. Whether it is peace or war, everything will follow the orders of the central government. Mr. Li also talked about Song Zheyuan's refusal to accept donations from all parties, saying that Mr. Song had repeatedly expressed to people that in the past, during Ma Zhanshan and the 19th Route Army's resistance against Japan, there were comfort donations from all parties, but later there were rumors that the donations could not directly reach the lower-level soldiers, etc. Mr. Song believes that the army is supported by the country and has the salary it deserves. Resisting the enemy is the duty of a soldier and should not receive extra gifts from the people. This is also to express his hard work for the country.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson's Fuhe Vessel Runs Aground</h3>
<p>Jiahe Sent for Rescue, Cargo to be Transferred First</p>
<p>The Fuhe vessel of Jardine Matheson, a British merchant firm, is currently sailing on the Sichuan River route. On the 14th, the vessel was carrying cargo from Yichang to be shipped to Chongqing. On the morning of the 16th, when it was sailing near ShihPaotuo, upstream of Wanxian County, due to the rapid current upstream and the receding water level in recent days, the vessel ran aground there. The Fuhe vessel's hull, its forward cabin, was stranded on the reef, causing it to collide and rupture. The front cabin immediately broke and flooded. After the accident, the shipowner urgently telegraphed Shanghai to report. Yesterday, the firm received the news and telegraphed the Jiahe vessel, which is currently sailing on the Sichuan River, to rush to the scene for rescue and to transfer the cargo from the Fuhe vessel to Chongqing. The Fuhe vessel is currently rescuing passengers inside the ship and they will be rescued soon.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai South Hospital Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Acting Mayor Yu Personally Cut the Ribbon, Complete Equipment, Light Burden on Patients</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal South Hospital held its opening ceremony yesterday at 3:00 pm. Acting Mayor Yu personally presided over the ceremony. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Reorganization Process</p>
<p>The hospital was reorganized from the former Shanghai Public Hospital, located on Santai Wharf Street on the Bund. After being taken over by the municipal government, the buildings were renovated and the internal equipment was improved. Specialized doctors were hired. It is now the only relatively well-equipped hospital in Shanghai South. Although the opening ceremony was held yesterday, most of the wards already have patients, and the outpatient clinic has been open for days.</p>
<p>Attending Guests</p>
<p>Those who attended the opening ceremony yesterday included Acting Mayor Yu, Director Li Ting'an, Wang Xiaolai, Lu Bohong, Wang Binyan, Wang Shaozhai, Cheng Shuzhen, and more than a hundred people from the Chinese and Western medical communities. Zhu Gonghong, the president of the hospital, and all the staff warmly welcomed and provided tea and refreshments after the meeting.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was held at 2:00 pm. After the ceremony was held as usual, Acting Mayor Yu gave a speech, saying that although the municipal government is currently facing an extremely tight budget, it will do its best to promote public health construction for the health of the citizens. He hoped that the colleagues of the hospital would understand the government's hard work in reorganizing the hospital and should work harder to make the hospital's affairs develop day by day, so that the citizens in the South Shanghai area can have a reliable guarantee of health. All responsibilities are on you, and I hope you will not disappoint the expectations of the citizens. He also hoped that people from all walks of life will give more guidance and practical support, which is also what he prayed for.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's Report</p>
<p>Then, Li Ting'an, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, gave a report, briefly saying that Shanghai Hospital was established at the end of the Qing Dynasty, initially established by private individuals, and later subsidized by local authorities and charitable organizations, and was named Shanghai Public Hospital. After the establishment of the municipal government, it also allocated funds for subsidies year by year, but due to the unsound organization and ununified administration of the Shanghai Public Hospital era, the hospital affairs became increasingly relaxed. On December 1, 1934, the municipal government ordered the hospital to be taken over and renamed Shanghai Municipal Hospital, and the Bureau appointed Wu Liguo, director of the Third Section, as the acting president, and Sun Jiazhai as the vice president, to reorganize the medical and nursing work of the hospital first, benefiting the patients. Later, Wu's president's work was cumbersome and could not be taken care of, and Zhu Runshen was changed to the president. On July 1 of this year, Zhu Runshen was transferred to the Bureau as a technician, and Zhu Gonghong was appointed as the successor. Since the reform of the hospital, it has made progress day by day, and it was fortunate that the former Mayor Wu allocated funds to rebuild the new house. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works planned the construction, and now the new house is completed, and the internal equipment is gradually complete. I hope that my colleagues will work harder, and the social people will help each other, and the hospital's diagnosis and treatment will strive for universality, and strive to reduce the burden of the patients, so that the general public can benefit from it.</p>
<p>Ribbon-Cutting Ceremony</p>
<p>After Director Li's report, Acting Mayor Yu performed the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The gate was decorated with a cross-shaped red ribbon. In the sound of military music, Acting Mayor Yu cut the colored ribbon and then opened the gate, and the ceremony was completed.</p>
<p>Internal Equipment</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Director Li and President Zhu led Acting Mayor Yu and all the guests to visit each room. The hospital is a three-story western-style building. In addition to the rooms used for offices, outpatient clinics, and other equipment, there are also wards with 130 beds. The wards are divided into three classes, the first class is the most expensive, the second class is the next, and most are the third class. There is a sanitation facility between every two wards, equipped with washbasins, bathtubs, and flush toilets. The first-class ward is 6 yuan per day, the second-class is 2 yuan, and the third-class is only 6 jiao. All medical and meal expenses are included. In terms of medical affairs, there are internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, dentistry, X-ray department, nursing department, pharmacy, and chemical examination room. In terms of physical therapy, there are new-style X-ray weaving machines, sun lamps, and thermal lamps. The operating room has the latest surgical machines, shadowless floodlights, new-style sterilizers, and surgical instruments. Other diagnostic and treatment equipment is sufficient for daily treatment.</p>

All the roads in the city were passed through. Because there were bands playing music and slogans flying, the citizens could not help but pay attention.</p>
<h3>Chen Zongli and Others Petition for the Maintenance of the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Three Points for Regulations and Procedures, Strictly Investigate Speculators</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reported that Chen Zongli, Hong Meixiang, Huang Zhenhua, Hu Lichang, and others, in order to maintain the bond market, sent a clear telegram to Chairman Jiang in Gu Ling and Vice Minister Xu of Finance. Ning Changwei of the Economic Commission said that since the Lugou Bridge Incident, the national bonds have plummeted by two boards. Although there are bond merchants who believe in national bonds and buy at low prices, the plunge is so violent and unstoppable. The financial circles and gentry and merchants who believe in national bonds have suffered great losses. Vice Minister Xu convened leaders from all walks of life in Shanghai to talk about the national bonds, and they should do their best to maintain them and offer suggestions for maintenance. However, unscrupulous merchants took the opportunity to short sell at this time of national crisis, intending to cause panic and disrupt the financial rear. Not only can it not be stabilized today, but it continues to fall by two or three yuan. If a broker, such as a certain company, sells a large amount, the amount in the quota has reached more than 10 million yuan. If the quota is not strictly investigated, more people will follow suit, and the national bonds will fall sharply, which is very dangerous in the future. Now, as far as my limited knowledge is concerned, the regulations are as follows: ㊀ In accordance with the regulations of the Flour and Cotton Cloth Exchange, the market price of national bonds on July 15 shall be the lowest price. The Exchange shall only be allowed to buy, not sell short. ㊁ The Central, China, and Communications Banks shall be ordered to maintain as much as possible in accordance with the foreign exchange regulations, and each merchant shall be allowed to arbitrage and mortgage to the three banks without restriction, and be exempt from paying for tracing certificates. ㊂ Strictly investigate the empty accounts of those who take the opportunity to monopolize. If the above three articles are adopted and implemented, the credit of national bonds will be strengthened, and the financial situation may be stabilized.</p>
<h3>Opinions on Improving Housing Problems by the Shanghai Municipal Council Subcommittee</h3>
<p>Approved by the Board of Directors with Amendments</p>
<p>Regarding the first paragraph of the ninth recommendation, which is to limit the height of future Chinese-style houses, the committee is aware that its purpose is to make all rooms so low that there is no way to build a mezzanine floor. However, this restriction may not be fair to the residents of the new Chinese-style houses to be built in the future. Therefore, it is proposed to delete the first paragraph, and the remaining paragraph can be incorporated into the eighth recommendation, that is, before the last sentence of the eighth recommendation, add the following suggestion: "The lane should maintain sufficient width, and in any case, it should not be less than five feet." Since the third recommendation is proposed to be amended as above, the second paragraph of the tenth recommendation can be deleted. The first paragraph is proposed to be amended as follows: "All mezzanine floors in houses used for industrial purposes, if they can be easily removed, or must be removed for safety reasons, should be removed immediately." It is more dangerous to build mezzanine floors in factories converted from residences. However, if the original recommendation is amended as proposed, the mezzanine floors built without authorization can be removed without causing excessive interference. The second paragraph of the fifth recommendation is proposed to be amended as follows: "The regulations should stipulate that the indoor air circulation and sanitary conditions should be improved, including adequate toilet facilities and more spacious and safe exits. In addition, it should also be stipulated that in the future, houses converted from residences into factories should not be allowed to build mezzanine floors as overcrowded accommodation places." In the seventh recommendation, before the phrase "houses converted into factories", it is proposed to add the word "future". Except for the above-mentioned amendments, the committee proposes that the board of directors approve and adopt the original report. The Public Works Committee of the bureau has proposed that the board of directors authorize the director of the Public Works Office of the bureau to add two public works officers when he deems it necessary to implement the committee's recommendations. It is also proposed to organize a committee to study and investigate the recommendations of the Housing Conditions Committee, with the Director of the Health Department, the Director of the Public Works Office, Miss Sinder, and representatives of the General Office or the Director, etc. as members. The committee approves the above two recommendations, but believes that some of the points to be studied, such as the explanation of birth control, are not within the scope of the bureau's duties. The committee wants to solemnly state that after the bureau adopts the report of the Housing Conditions Committee, it does not mean that the housing problem can be solved immediately. The bureau does not want to expel people who have no other houses to live in when implementing the recommendations in the report. The bureau will listen to reports on the progress of implementing various recommendations at any time, so that the bureau can know how to consider various plans in the future. However, the situation here is not within the scope of the committee's discussion.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, This Consulate Received Donations to Comfort the North China Soldiers</h3>

<h3>The Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Investigate the Truth of Bond Market Changes</h3>
<p>Inspect Accounts with Various Banks</p>
<p>The bond market has been fluctuating for days, and people are quite uneasy. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi, who is on a mission abroad, is very concerned and telegraphed Vice Minister Xu Kan to stabilize the bond market. In addition to Vice Minister Xu having convened people from all walks of life in Shanghai to talk about it, it is reported that the responsible department of the Ministry of Finance will now send personnel to Shanghai to inspect the accounts of various banks to report to the Ministry for verification.</p>
<h3>Specialist Students of the General Training Corps Will Hold a Parade Ceremony Today</h3>
<p>Students from specialist colleges and above in the Municipal Student General Training Corps are scheduled to hold a parade ceremony at 7:00 am today at the Huacao Town Zhongzheng Camp in West Shanghai. It is reported that a large number of invitation cards have been issued, inviting people from all walks of life to attend the ceremony. The ceremony is recorded as follows: 1. Raising the flag; 2.

<h3>Completion of Witness Interrogation Procedures; Investigation of Promissory Notes to Commence</h3>
<p>Further Announcement of Indictment or Non-Prosecution; Lawyer Representing Wu Sheng Presents Opinions in Court; Rumors and Hearsay Accusing People of Crimes is Unfair; Vice Chairman of a Brokerage, Shao Wenmei, Summoned in Another Case</p>
<p>After the cotton cloth exchange craze, the authorities investigated and concluded that Wu Jingding, Director of the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, and Sheng Yuan, Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Consolidated Tax Bureau, were involved in speculation and manipulation, violating Article 130 of the Criminal Code, which states: "Public officials who, by abusing their power, opportunity, or methods of their positions, intentionally commit crimes other than those in this chapter shall have their sentences increased by up to one-half; however, this does not apply if the punishment is specifically stipulated for public officials."</p>
<p>Exchange Law</p>
<p>Article 52: "Those who intentionally fluctuate the market price of an exchange by spreading rumors, using tricks, engaging in violence, or coercion shall be sentenced to imprisonment for no more than two years, or a fine of no more than six thousand yuan." The First Special District Court Prosecutor's Office is conducting an investigation, led by Prosecutor Song Genshan, who has conducted a fourth investigation at the Fifth Criminal Court. Those summoned are suspects Wu Jingding and Sheng Yuan. Additionally, the Shanghai District Court is handling a case of</p>
<p>Dereliction of Duty and Embezzlement</p>
<p>and needs to question Shao Wenmei, Vice Chairman of a brokerage, so a warrant was issued by the Special First Court. Therefore, Shao was also summoned to court today. The two suspects, Wu and Sheng, arrived before 9:00 AM, each accompanied by their attorneys Zhong Liankui, Tong Yuwen, Li Jinfu, Li Gongyin, and Li Guozhen. Sheng Yuan's other attorney, Ma Taohua, did not arrive. The audience, men and women, filled the seats. At 9:10 AM, Prosecutor Song, along with the court clerk, took their seats and summoned Sheng Yuan to the stand. He explained that if the</p>
<p>Evidence is Insufficient</p>
<p>according to law, no indictment will be issued. If both were engaged in transactions at the exchange and did not violate the law, there is no reason to pursue the matter. Therefore, both should speak truthfully; otherwise, if substantial evidence is obtained through investigation in the future, it will be detrimental to both. Sheng replied that he was truly implicated innocently. The court then asked Sheng about his siblings. He answered each question, stating that he has eight brothers and eight sisters, with three brothers and three sisters still alive. He</p>
<p>Ranks Seventh</p>
<p>among the siblings. His sisters are the Fifth Miss, Seventh Miss, and Eighth Miss. The Fifth Miss lives on Avenue Joffre, the Seventh Miss lives on Yu Garden Road, and the Eighth Miss lives on Gordon Road. Their addresses are unclear. The Fifth Miss's husband, Lin Weiyuan (phonetic), is divorced. The Seventh Miss's husband, Zhuang Zhijiu (phonetic), is in business and works for a foreign firm. My father passed away between 1914 and 1915, leaving millions in family assets. We divided the inheritance over twenty years ago. The Fifth Miss and Seventh Miss conduct transactions, but since we have lived separately for many years, I am unaware of their activities. Their finances are</p>
<p>Independent</p>
<p>Each has approximately several hundred thousand in assets. Whether their transactions are speculative or collaborative is unknown as I have not inquired. Our family's ancestral hall is named Shushantang. I do not know Anderson or Dong Zaisun. This time, I am truly implicated innocently. The testimonies of various witnesses are either hearsay or speculation, placing unfounded accusations on the defendant, which is unfair. Accusing people of crimes based on hearsay is</p>
<p>Truly Unjust</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have absolutely not conducted any transactions at the exchange. Now that I have been accused, I request that the court compel the accuser to present concrete evidence. Relying solely on rumors is hardly fair, he stated. The court then summoned Wu Qiding to the stand. He testified, "I have never engaged in cotton yarn trading. It is unjust to assume that I have traded cotton yarn based solely on Chu Qiaqing's statement that I have done so before. Moreover, I was part of the team investigating the cotton exchange craze. How can suspicion be</p>
<p>Placed Upon Me</p>
<p>I can give up my official position, but I must maintain my integrity. Therefore, I implore the court to uphold justice and thoroughly investigate the matter," he stated. Prosecutor Song, after reviewing the testimonies, stated that the process of interrogating witnesses is now complete, with only the investigation of promissory notes remaining. Therefore, if there is no need for further hearings, there will be no more. An announcement of indictment or non-prosecution will be made. He then instructed the attorneys of the accused</p>
<p>To Present Their Opinions</p>
<p>First, Li Jiefu and Li Guozhen, attorneys for Sheng Yuan, stated that Sheng Yuan's investigation was based on alleged violations of Article 34 and Article 52 of the Criminal Code and Exchange Law. The latter article requires conditions such as spreading rumors and using tricks. According to the official letter from the Ministry of Industry, Li Xiangming stated that Sheng Yuan was a major speculator, which the Ministry's investigation also indicated. However, there is no concrete evidence. Furthermore, when the court questioned Mu Xiangming, Mu claimed to have heard it from Lan Ting, but when he was in court, he</p>
<p>Denied It</p>
<p>Stating that Mu was mistaken. According to Mu, there were two reasons for the craze. One was the government's plan to raise foreign loans to redeem domestic debts to reduce interest rates. The other was the shortage of cotton yarn and high demand. The Ministry added a conclusion to Mu's statement, stating that it showed collusion between officials and merchants to engage in manipulation. However, the first reason was based on Minister Kong's statements abroad, which</p>
<p>Were Widely Reported</p>
<p>The second reason is a fact. How can it be attributed to rumors spread by the accused? The Ministry's basis, besides Mu's statement, also included Lu Qiaqing's statement. However, both Mu and Yu stated in court that it was mere rumor. Yu stated that the Ministry's records indicated that Sheng Yuan was definitely a member of the Qixing Company, which he denied. It is</p>
<p>Unlawful</p>
<p>to accuse people of crimes based solely on rumors. Therefore, the court should issue a non-prosecution order. Then, Qin Liankui, Tong Yuwen, and Li Jinfu, attorneys for Wu Qiding, rose to present their opinions, stating that according to Article 3 of the official service regulations, public officials who accuse others of crimes must be as loyal and cautious as when performing any official duty. However, the Ministry's accusation this time</p>
<p>Implicated</p>
<p>Wu Qiding, who had no evidence. The only basis was that Wu Qiding's name was registered under Dai Xinghua's name in the Yuanda Company ledger. However, upon inspecting the ledger, the character "Wu" was initially written as "Hu," and then corrected. This shows that Wu had no connection with the company. Even the surname was initially written incorrectly. Furthermore, Tie Xinghua testified that Wu was indeed unrelated. To manipulate the exchange's market price, one must have transactions within the exchange. Since the accused</p>
<p>Had No Transactions</p>
<p>then why would he manipulate the market price? The Ministry, considering the accused to be an official responsible for collecting cotton yarn taxes, concluded that he was involved, which is adding fuel to the fire and forcibly imposing guilt. This is not being loyal or cautious. After interpreting the testimonies of various witnesses, they also requested a non-prosecution order, and in the non-prosecution order,</p>
<p>Detail the Reasons</p>
<p>so that the public may understand the truth. Then, Prosecutor Song summoned Shao Wenmei to court to question her on the points entrusted by the Shanghai District Court. Regarding whether Finance Minister Zou and Public Debt Division Director Jiang Luofu were present when he inspected the yarn exchange on July 3rd, Shao replied that many people from the Ministry of Finance came that day. They only recognized Minister Zou and did not know if Jiang was among them. Prosecutor Song then ordered her to leave the court and adjourned the session.</p>
<h3>American Sailor's Trunk Filled with Opium</h3>
<p>Fearing Inspection by Indian Police, Threw It into the Huangpu River; Claimed He Was Paid to Take It to the Philippines; All 108 Cans Recovered</p>
<p>According to the English "Greater Shanghai Evening Post," a sailor named Gong Chailishi, who recently became an American citizen, carried a trunk to the Jardine Wharf on Wednesday night, intending to board the "Steel Mariner," a ship about to sail to Manila. He was stopped by an Indian guard who wanted to inspect the trunk, but Gong refused. The Indian guard then called another Indian guard for assistance. Gong then threw the trunk into the Huangpu River. Unexpectedly, as soon as the trunk hit the water, the lid opened, and some of the opium it contained spilled out. A nearby water patrol recovered sixty-three small bars, each weighing five taels. Gong was arrested and sent to the American Consulate. According to his confession, he was a Colombian from South America. When he arrived in Shanghai, he received a message instructing him to go to the corner near the post office of the New Asia Hotel on Sunday. He did not know anyone in Shanghai, but out of curiosity, he went. He saw a Chinese man who greeted him in a car. The man asked him if he wanted to earn money without labor. He answered ambiguously. Later, he met the two men again, who offered him 1,500 yuan to take a trunk to the Philippines. If he encountered any problems, he could throw the trunk into the water. The name of the person receiving the trunk in Manila would be given to him when the ship sailed. He, tempted by the immediate gain, agreed. The two Chinese men have not been apprehended. Chief Judge of the United States Court for China, He Laimike, set bail at US$5,000. Gong, unable to pay the bail, is temporarily detained in the Ward Road Prison, pending further hearings. According to a reporter from this newspaper, when passengers boarded the American ship "Steel Mariner," which was docked at the Qichang Line Wharf in Pudong, some threw a large quantity of iron ingots placed in their luggage into the Huangpu River to avoid inspection. After someone reported this to the Water Patrol, officers were dispatched to salvage the items. In the first retrieval, sixty-three cans were recovered, each containing five taels of opium. Yesterday morning, another forty-five cans were retrieved, totaling one hundred and eight cans, totaling five hundred and forty taels. They were taken into custody pending further action.</p>
<h3>Luring a Young Girl to Watch Lanterns and Introducing Her to a Paramour for Rape</h3>
<p>Fearful of Returning Home, the Girl Complained to Her Grandmother; Jiang Yungao and Liu Duanshi Detained and Sent to Court</p>
<p>Huang Yaoge, a local resident who owns a printing shop, is 48 years old and lives at No. 10 Ziyang Lane, Cengshan Road, Hongkou. He has a daughter named Baoshu, who is 15 years old. She lives with her parents. A few months ago, a Hubei woman named Liu Duanshi, 24 years old, rented a room in Huang's house. She was unfaithful and had an affair with Jiang Yungao (40 years old), a laborer in the weaving room of the Taikoo Wharf. Recently, Liu Duanshi, wanting to please her paramour, lured Huang Yaoge's daughter, Baoshu, out on the evening of the 14th of this month to see the lanterns in the French Concession. They went to Room 16 of the Dongwu Inn on Route Wagner in the French Concession. Jiang Yungao and Liu Duanshi, working together, made the girl spend the night with Jiang, while Liu quietly left. Huang Yaoge, seeing that his daughter had not returned home, suspected that the lodger, Liu Duanshi, was involved. After repeatedly questioning her, she pretended to search for the girl and reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. However, Baoshu, after being away from home for two days, feared that her parents would be angry, so she dared not return home. She went to her grandmother's house at No. 8 Shude Lane, Rue Bellesoeur, in the French Concession and tearfully told her grandmother what had happened. Her grandmother then informed Baoshu's father, Huang Yaoge, who reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station. Liu Duanshi was arrested and confessed to her affair with Jiang Yungao. Jiang was also arrested. Since the incident occurred in the French Concession, the case was transferred to the French Police Station. Yesterday, Liu Duanshi and Jiang Yungao were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Court President Liao presided over the hearing. Police Department lawyer Fei Xizhen presented the case, accusing them of violating public morals and requesting an extension for further investigation. After briefly questioning the plaintiff, the victim, and the defendants, the court adjourned the session until 8:00 AM on the 24th for further proceedings. The defendants were remanded to custody.</p>
<h3>Father Disapproves of Daughter's Unauthorized Marriage, Daughter Attempts Suicide</h3>
<p>Father-in-Law Publishes Warning, Son-in-Law Panics</p>
<p>Zhang Hongyue, a native of Pudong, is 46 years old and works at the Zhonghua Book Company. He lives at No. 673 Rue Bellesoeur in the French Concession. He has a daughter named Liangji, who is about to turn twenty. After graduating from middle school, she is now studying at the Zhenru Southeast Medical College. A few years ago, she met and became acquainted with Qiu Shaoxian, a young man from Guangdong (26 years old). Qiu helped Liangji with her school expenses, and they developed deep feelings for each other. Liangji's father, Zhang Hongyue, also approved of the relationship and tacitly considered Qiu Shaoxian as his future son-in-law. Unexpectedly, Liangji recently changed her mind and became strongly acquainted with Qin Huilin (23 years old, residing at No. 33 Fuyu Lane, Haller Road, Hongkou), a fellow villager. They developed a romantic relationship, and without notifying her father, she secretly published an engagement announcement with Qin and officially married him at Qin's house on October 27th. When her father learned of this, he expressed his opposition and published a statement in the newspaper, giving Liangji three days to return home, or he would take legal action. Qin Huilin, upon seeing the announcement, panicked and asked people to mediate with the girl's father. However, the girl's father had already set his sights on Qiu Shaoxian and firmly refused mediation. Liangji, seeing that a positive outcome was unlikely, in desperation, attempted suicide. At 3:00 AM the previous morning, she left home and swallowed two engagement rings (one gold and one ivory). Her lover, Qin Huilin, discovered that Liangji's face was pale and knew something was wrong. He immediately sent her in a car to the McGeary Jen Chi Hospital for treatment. The hospital, as usual, reported the incident to the police. Since the girl's home was in the French Concession, the Public Police Department notified the French Concession, and detectives were dispatched to investigate.</p>
<h3>Municipal Police Department Suspends Issuance of North China Travel Permits</h3>
<p>Due to Tense Situation in North China</p>
<p>Due to the increasingly severe situation in North China, the Passport Inspection Office of the Municipal Police Department suspended the issuance of travel permits for foreigners to visit North China yesterday. According to the person in charge of the office, the situation in North China is still tense, making it dangerous for foreigners to visit. All permits have been temporarily suspended. However, permits for foreigners requesting to visit Qingdao are still being issued.</p>
<h3>Doctor Flees House, Female Corpse Found Inside</h3>
<p>Prosecutor Seeks to Understand the Truth, Performs Autopsy on Scene, Death Caused by Illegal Abortion</p>
<p>In the western wing of the downstairs apartment at No. 3 Buliu Lane, 888 Avenue Edward VII, lived Wang Zhinan, a doctor from Suzhou, along with his wife and daughter. At approximately 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, the second landlord, a woman named Yan Fengshi, suddenly noticed that Wang and his family had abandoned the house. She also discovered the corpse of a woman, approximately thirty years old, in Wang's residence. She reported this to the Chengdu Road Police Station, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The corpse was taken to the Phylong Road Crematorium. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Zhang, accompanied by medical examiners, to the crematorium. To understand the truth, Zhang ordered medical examiners Wei and Zhang to perform an autopsy on the scene. The autopsy revealed that the woman had died from an illegal abortion. The corpse was then sent to the Pushan Cemetery for burial.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>Backed by the Strength of the People</h3>
<p>— Mu Chu</p>
<p>Since the Lugouqiao Incident, the entire nation has been extremely indignant. The officers and soldiers of the Twenty-Ninth Army declared that "Lugouqiao can be our burial ground," while Zhang Zizhong declared, "Zhang will never do anything to let the people down." Japanese newspapers also stated that "China's anti-Japanese sentiment is strong." The people in the rear are enthusiastically providing support and sending telegrams of consolation. The entire prison population of Ba County, Sichuan, sent two telegrams on the 16th: (1) fasting to raise funds to comfort the Twenty-Ninth Army soldiers defending the territory; (2) telegram to superiors requesting permission to fight against the enemy, hoping to be assigned and led to the front lines. The telegrams also stated, "Although prisoners do not have the rights of citizens, they have the obligations of nationals, and their patriotic hearts dare not be in vain." (Central News Agency, Chongqing, 16th) Mr. Wang Jingwei said: "If people harm us, we cannot but resist!" Now that the Japanese authorities "decided not to interfere in the governance of North China," even prisoners without "the rights of citizens" are willing to fulfill "the obligations of nationals" and voluntarily fast to raise funds to comfort the soldiers defending the territory. We cannot ignore this unanimous voice of the people.</p>
<p>However, news came that the officials of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council were holding so-called "peace" talks with the Japanese in the form of a local incident, and Song Zheyuan, who had achieved great feats at Xifengkou, also sent a telegram on the 15th, saying: "Since the unfortunate Lugouqiao Incident, people from all walks of life at home and abroad have sent telegrams of condolences and have donated funds to comfort the army. With such enthusiastic support, the entire army is moved. This incident is only a local conflict, with few casualties. Moreover, the state has raised soldiers for a thousand days to use them for one moment, and to serve the country and be wounded in battle is the duty of soldiers. The army has regular pay during peacetime and military expenses during wartime. Zheyuan believes that it is inappropriate to seek assistance from compatriots at home and abroad for such small conflicts. While we are very grateful for everyone's kindness, we dare not accept the donations. If a major international war occurs in the future, and the whole country is mobilized, with huge sacrifices, it will not be too late for the state to coordinate donations from compatriots." The state has raised soldiers for a thousand days to use them for one moment, and to serve the country and be wounded in battle is the duty of soldiers, which does not need to be explained, and everyone knows it. The army has regular pay during peacetime and military expenses during wartime, which everyone also knows. However, the reason why compatriots at home and abroad donate funds to comfort the army is to express the patriotic enthusiasm of the people in the rear, which is the so-called "popular sentiment." This valuable spirit should not be rejected outright, and when a powerful enemy is pressing down, accepting donations from compatriots often does not lead to "shame." This is one point. Furthermore, saying that "this incident is only a local conflict" plays right into the hands of the Japanese, allowing them to nibble away at our territory while heavily surrounding us. And can the so-called "peace" talks guarantee that the Hebei-Chahar authorities will uphold their solemn declaration of "never sacrificing national sovereignty?"</p>
<p>The entire nation has unanimously risen up to resist the enemy and save the country, and at the same time, everyone's attention "is focused on Nanjing, on whether it is preparing for military action" (Reuters, Central, 16th). Now may be the time for "national mobilization, with huge sacrifices!"</p>
<p>At this critical moment, we hope that the truth is as stated by the Twenty-Ninth Army's Shanghai Office: "The other side has sent representatives to contact us, making requests, but we will never accept them. There is no agreement at present, and there is no loss of national sovereignty or territory." And in Song's reply to Mr. Sun, Song, Du, and Yang, he stated: "Our army is actively preparing for war at every moment" (Local news, 16th).</p>
<p>Backed by the strength of the people, we must not accept any unofficial "peace" talks.</p>
<h3>After Watching "Golden Field Village" of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Li Yi</p>
<p>From "Romeo and Juliet" to "Wu Zetian" is progress, and from "Wu Zetian" to the first part of this "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," "Golden Field Village," is further progress. Being able to progress is undoubtedly gratifying.</p>
<p>Regarding the historical facts of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," as with "Wu Zetian," I can only express my shallowness and apologize for not being able to say a single word about it. Therefore, I can only be a reader regarding whether what is written in this play distorts the historical facts of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" and whether the personalities of several leading figures such as Hong Xiuquan, Feng Yunshan, and Yang Xiuqing have been fabricated by the author. I am prepared to read the works of experts who have studied history. Fortunately, the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" is not far from the present, and there are many books on the literature of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom" recently published in bookstores. If experts do not regard the play as a trivial skill, I think this wish of mine can always be fulfilled. Then, even if I have seen only a little bit of the records of the historical facts of the "Taiping Heavenly Kingdom," how dare I "teach fish to swim?"</p>
<p>I am a pragmatist. Therefore, for an individual performance, its evaluation, I think,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>should be viewed from its sum. Of course, if criticizing, it should be analyzed, and this analysis should preferably have percentages, giving it a fair and accurate evaluation after careful observation. However, for the audience, this analysis is mostly secondary. The impression they see and get is always the whole. As for me, I am exactly an audience member, so my afterthoughts can only be used as reference material for the "Yishi" troupe, to see how the performance of "Golden Field Village" evokes a response in a certain type of audience.</p>
<p>Regarding the significance of "Golden Field Village" being staged at present and its objective effect, I would like to first quote some words from the playwright Mr. Chen Baichen: "Historical plays are about correctly evaluating a subject in history that is related to real life and recreating it through artistic means, not simply moving the history books," "I do not admit that what it (referring to "Golden Field Village") stages has no connection with real life, nor do I admit that it abandons the times, let alone that it is a speculative work catering to low-level tastes!" Based on such a perspective, the author tells us in the first act that "the Qing court ceded land and paid indemnities, which further increased harsh taxes and levies, and corrupt officials and bureaucrats were worse than robbers, and yamen runners were no different from jackals. With 'officials oppressing the people and the people rebelling,' the world became 'full of bandits.'" "Guangdong and Guangxi have been plagued by years of disasters, with wails of misery everywhere. The rich create 'local militias' to protect themselves, while the poor 'Hakka' people suffer from hunger and cold, and have no way to appeal, thus planting the seeds of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom revolution." Such a phenomenon, comparing the past with the present, still exists. What is even more gratifying is that the playwright and director have paid attention to the strength of the masses, attributing the victory of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to this group of people who took the risk, while the root cause of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's failure is foreshadowed in the "manipulation of power by a few villains," and hundreds of thousands of people are kept in the dark. This is not only recording history but also criticizing history. (Whether it deviates from historical truth should be another matter.) Using such a creative attitude to handle historical plays, its objective effect is consistent with the subjective motivation, and there is naturally a great possibility of achieving success.</p>
<p>The second reason why I like this play is that the characterizations are distinct, and with the director and actors' serious efforts, it becomes even more endearing. What is even more gratifying is that the acting skills of several newcomers are not weaker than those of the "veterans." For example, Shu Qiang, who plays Yu Tingzhang, Jin Naihua, who plays Li Yiwen, Fan Lai, who plays Shi Dakai, and Lu Fu, who plays Ma Yunshan, all have excellent achievements here, making people even more convinced that as long as they are used appropriately, newcomers are not incapable of acting. As for the "veterans," Wei Heling, Zhang Manping, and Ying Yin all make me happy. Tao Jin's acting in this play, among the plays I have seen him in, should be one of his best, although he is a bit weaker in the sixth act. Zhao Dan plays Wang Xiucai here, and the role is not important. If it is seen as dispelling the star system, then this should also be commendable.</p>
<p>Regarding the director, the tone of the play is very harmonious with the script. Coupled with the rough but not crude stage set, it has a kind of natural and thick beauty. However, the song "Fighting for the Jiangshan" still lacks grandeur. It always feels like it lacks a kind of vast, earth-shattering power. In some places, perhaps because too much emphasis is placed on the compactness of the play, the climax is not supported. However, fortunately, this is not very obvious. Generally speaking, it can be said to be very tight.</p>
<p>As for lighting, "Yishi" can be said to be unmatched among the theater troupes in the country. The third amateur performance brought drama to light on the stage, and in this "Golden Field Village," lightning and rainbows were created. Although the lightning flash is still not fast enough, and a few times it seems to make the audience feel a pause, it can probably be corrected after a few performances due to proficiency.</p>
<p>However, the position of the lights should be noted in the dark, so as not to be seen by the audience. For example, in the first act of "Golden Field Village," there is a scene (I can't remember which scene) in which the overhead lights can be seen (I was sitting in the seventh row), and in the sixth act, the side lights can also be seen. This small oversight, although it can be corrected with a wave of the hand, leaves a different impression on the audience.</p>
<h3>No Strength Should Be Overlooked</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>Many things are often done out of necessity, and are not what one originally intended. Take the case of those who become traitors; who would originally want to be one? It's certain that no one is born to be a traitor. However, it must be said that those who are depraved and willingly act as accomplices for evil should naturally be considered separately. And there are many such examples. The newspaper's Tianjin dispatch on the 15th stated:</p>
<p>"...The Japanese Army's accounting department stationed in Tianjin secretly organized plainclothes teams within the Japanese concession in mid-June... Recruited ruffians, provided them with training, and gave each person a daily living allowance of six jiao. By the night of the 7th of this month, after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, this plainclothes team numbered about 600 people... They were issued a rifle each by name, ready to be deployed... However, due to incomplete preparations, it was delayed until about 3:00 AM on the 12th when a small number of vanguards were dispatched... Our security forces have extremely solid defenses, so the hastily assembled plainclothes team did not dare to act rashly. They temporarily changed their plans and, in the small alleys near Gushen Street and Fuli Lane in the Nanshi district, a small part of the plainclothes team fired more than ten shots at the Chinese area. Fortunately, our security police at the Yijin Lane intersection were also prepared... These plainclothes team members were usually local thugs and ruffians who did not understand military affairs. Their fundamental goal was to swindle money from the Japanese, and they had no courage to sacrifice their lives. After firing a few shots, they fled with their heads in their hands..."</p>
<p>Naturally, they did not, and would not, estimate the advantages, disadvantages, and importance of this matter. But to say that they intended to betray seems too assertive, right? They fundamentally didn't know anything. We can see that the biggest reason they enlisted was because they were driven by life's necessities. Life is the most cruel and ruthless. A certain side saw this vulnerability and cleverly exploited it. We don't know how many times we've seen this kind of thing.</p>
<p>However, this doesn't mean there's no solution. Naturally, the most fundamental solution is to ensure that they are not driven by life's necessities. But this issue is so significant and difficult to resolve, yet it must be resolved. However, the problem is not so simple. What's more important is to awaken them. People, after all, have humanity. If they have an accurate understanding, they will certainly not recklessly engage in shameless acts of betrayal. From this, we can see how essential this work is at present, and it is especially necessary to link it to practical actions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the nation's survival crisis, we must mobilize every member to work together to save the country, and no strength should be overlooked. It is our fault, and a loss to the nation, if any strength is used by the enemy. Now the sound of gunfire has already begun in North China! We must mobilize every member and must not overlook any strength, thereby weakening our overall strength. Now is the time for everyone to unite!</p>
