<h3>我軍扼守原陣綫羅店東部村落昨激戰</h3>
<p>敵向侯家宅一帶進犯被我殺退　閘北方面敵數度來攻均遭慘敗　我浦東陣地發砲中敵領署附近</p>
<p>本報昨晚接得前綫確實戰報如下、㊀市政府之東南、敵軍築有野戰砲陣地、於前日下午三時許起、向我江灣附近陣地、聯繪射擊、因無標的、所發砲彈、悉落田野間、我軍陣地、毫無損傷、㊁前日午後五時許、復旦大學以東、發現敵軍步兵五六百名、江灣葉家花圜以東、亦有敵軍步兵三四百名、又在淞滬鐵路東面、有敵軍迫擊砲六門、坦克車十餘輛似有所企圖㊂楊行方面之敵軍、於前日午前九時起、向我楊九房附近陣地攻擊、當被我軍奮勇擊退、敵死傷數十名㊃羅店方面、自昨晨以來、敵軍分向侯家宅·金家宅·及龔家宅附近一帶陣地、猛力攻擊、我軍初則沉着應戰、繼則出壕厮殺、激戰至當日（廿一日）下午三時、敵軍死傷極多、我某旅亦有死傷、㊄我某軍正面之敵、前昨兩日、迭被我軍出奇襲擊、受創極鉅、傷亡兩千餘名、故昨日午後起、該敵已不敢進犯、且其砲數亦已减少、又我某師正面前有敵軍大批傷兵、向從方押運、並有驢馬甚多由羅店鎮北面向東移動、諒因連日攻擊遭挫、另有新企圖、</p>
<p>中央社南京二十一日電、航空界息、據崇明縣屬枸𣏌山沈島逃出居民云、有日本巡洋艦一艘、驅逐艦一艘、停泊枸杞山之西、陸戰隊登陸、用槍掃射島民、除一部份逃嵊山外、餘均被捕、形勢緊張、</p>
<p>軍息、敵軍先後企圖在羅店及榻行、實行中央突擊、均遭我軍迎頭痛擊、迄來得逞、連日敵方又集中大軍於市中心區一帶、企圖向江灣進犯、惟我軍在該處兵力雄厚、戒備嚴密、敵如來犯、决予重創、</p>
<h3>羅店方面敵我五次肉搏</h3>
<p>羅店方面之敵迭受重創後、雖待援補充、不敢大擧來犯但數日來仍蠢動未已、惟我軍每次均予以迎頭痛擊、並猛烈反攻現仍確保原有陣綫、密嚴警戒中頃據確悉、十九日下午、敵方有轟炸機在羅店西北上空、對我曹王廟以北三公里處楊家村·蘇村·一帶投彈甚久、入晚、敵砲十餘門、向蘇村東約二公里之沈家村及其北之鼓手村一帶陣地、猛烈射繫、發彈無算、至十一時許、突行夜襲、以一營以上之兵力、向我蘇村及鼓手村進犯、我軍早作準備．卽派勁旅迎頭逆襲、士卒奮勇異常、衝鋒肉搏、至五次之多、敵陣紊亂、紛紛潰竄、我軍未子追擊、仍固守蘇村·鼓手村·蔣宅·西宋宅之綫、</p>
<p>羅店西北、舵晚有劇烈之戰事、朝王廟正北約三公里處之楊家村蘇村我軍陣地、敵機於下午起、轟炸甚熱、蘇村北之鼓手村我軍陣地、亦為敵砲火集中之目標、敵軍砲位大部、放置於蘇村東約二公里之沈家村、其所射砲火、當在千餘發以上、轟擊至夜半十一時許、敵之步兵、開始動作、約計有一大隊以上之兵力、猛向我蘇村及鼓手村進犯、我軍堅守不退、為求迎頭痛擊計、亦派相當兵力、躍出戰壕、予以迎擊、衝鋒肉搏、凡五次以上、敵在我猛烈反攻之下、傷亡遍野、損失不貲、潰退之殘敵、狼狽不堪、我軍蘇村·鼓手村·蔣宅·西宋宅之綫、堅固異常、昨日午後、敵砲又在該綫一帶轟擊、我砲隊亦予以還擊、昨晚小股敵軍、又企圖進犯騷擾、部份被擊潰退外、其餘悉被我殲滅、</p>
<h3>敵襲劉行又被擊退</h3>
<p>敵軍屢攻我劉行、企圖突破我中路陳綫、連日以來、均被擊退、十九晚𥩐家弄一帶、發生激烈戰鬥、自朝至晚、敵軍集中其砲火、向我竇家弄·孟灣·王九房·附近陣地猛烈轟擊、並不絕以機多架、向我陣地偵察、入晚、其步兵在砲火掩護之下、向我進犯、我軍奮勇迎戰、血戰通宵、卒將敵擊退．前晨拂曉、我軍陳宅·王宅·楊九房一帶陣地、又有敵踪發現、向我進犯攻擊、我軍沉着應戰至午敵不支紛紛後退、至前晚敵加入援軍𥩐家弄一帶、又發生澈宵激戰至昨晨拂曉、敵已被迫後退、</p>
<p>中央社、軍息、劉行方面我軍、日前又獲重大勝利、該方敵軍自十七日被我擊潰後、至十九日父由楊行方面以重兵向我陣地進犯我軍沉着應戰、雙方互以重砲及機關槍轟擊、激戰兩晝夜、迄未停息、至二十日下午、我軍乘敵軍困疲之際、躍出戰壕、勇猛衝鋒展開白刃血戰、敵軍不支潰退、是役敵軍傷亡達二千人以上.因之昨日前綫又趨沉寂、砲火亦漸稀少、同時羅店區之敵軍、亦同東移動、似係增厚楊行方兵力、</p>
<h3>敵攻閘北遭受重創</h3>
<p>久困閘北至江灣一綫之敵經四十日之力戰非獨毫無進展、抑且日現窮蹙、設非戰事軍心移向羅店沿岸帶、則該方面之敵恐早被我軍掃蕩纖滅矣、近數日內該綫戰事雖繼續未停、雜均係前哨衝突、並無激烈戰况、前日黎明、敵又以戰車五輛先導、掩護步兵四百餘人、沿體育會路及周家宅附近、向我狄家浜一帶陣地作拂曉攻擊、同時敵軍砲隊、亦發砲猛轟、並利用少數部隊、向該段左右兩翼擾亂以冀遂其突破我軍該段防綫之夢想、經我軍奮起迎擊、敵之五輛戰車、經我平射砲·小鋼砲、及機關槍等之密集火力、已遭受重創、激戰歷一小時之久、敵卒不支、倉皇潰退、而其掩護之四百餘名步兵已傷亡過半、前夜昨晨、敵又數度來犯但一無所獲、</p>
<h3>敵圖犯浦東益亟</h3>
<p>先以空軍低飛偵察繼又發砲　我開砲還擊日領署附近中彈</p>
<p>昨日午從四時許、敵機數架、在浦東低空窺察數週後、約於四時三刻、停泊外白渡橋浦面之敵艦、亦向我浦東方面發砲、我砲兵亦卽開砲還擊、在日領署附近、被我擊中數彈、頓時着火、約二十分鐘後、砲聲始歸沉寂、</p>
<p>昨日午後四時三十六分、有敵砲艦一艘、從楊樹浦方面急駛到白渡橋下、時正漲瀚、該艦卽在陸家嘴前江心中、拋錨停泊、艦首正對春江碼頭、見艦內有身穿白制服之海軍甚多自下艙奔馳往來於二三層臺甲上、工作至為忙碌、惟察其情勢、似有竚機襲攻浦東而謀偷渡上陸之情形、𡐰十數分鐘、方將該艦停好、兵士乃多匿居在艦艙中、中棧前泊有敵十三號艦、二號河筒泊有出雲艦策應、</p>
<p>敵軍自迭次企圖在浦東登陸失敗以來、前數日復盛傳於最近將大擧進犯、以遂其消除我砲軍給予日艦之重大威脅、並可大量取用沿浦各日棧堆存之煤炭、再圖進取、詎知我方洞悉其奸謀、事先各地從容配備雄厚兵力、構築强固工事、遂使敵人登陸幻夢、成為泡影、而彼方亦深知對我陣綫己不能輕易進攻、故五日來最緊張之時期、反趨沉寂、日夜並無激烈行動、至日機雖有時用機槍向平民掃射、並拋擲炸彈、以及浦江日艦與我砲軍之斷續砲戰、均屬無關大局、且我軍亦未受到任何損害、卽自前晚起以迄於今晨止、我軍在沿浦各口岸、均戢陣以待、莧至絕無衝突之可能性發生、據一般觀察、敵方謀攻浦東之擧、並非卽此放棄、蓋數日來正忙於凖備工作也、</p>
<h3>浦江敵艦來去匆忙</h3>
<p>昨晨黎明前、有一萬餘噸之敵巡洋艦三艘、駛抵淞口、現泊淞口外三峽水江面、其名稱為Nino、一為Yrno、另一艘名稱不明、該三艦艦身皆係深灰色、各艦皆有姻囪三個、烟囱上並有白紋二條想又係載運敵援軍來滬者、此外同時並有敵紅十字艦駛到、亦洎松口外江面、艦名American、想係凖備載運敵傷兵返國者、</p>
<h3>敵軍又到大批軍火</h3>
<p>連日陸續駛滬之敵運輸艦、先後總數、已逹五十艘以上、除一部份用以載運敵援軍來滬外、大部分皆為裝載敵軍火及軍需品而用者、故敵軍關於軍備之補充、至·最近已相當充實·現大阪·黃浦·招商局中棧·北棧·匯山各碼頭棧房、及沿浦各紗廠·皆已堆滿敵軍火、運日來敵卡車來往裝赴各方、甚為忙碌、至前陸續駛灑之敵衣笠丸。第五雲海丸、武陵丸、及另一艘無名號之運輸艦等四艘、已於前晚相繼離滬返日、而停靠招商局化機之良友丸、於昨日大雨中、怱怱將運來之軍火及大批綠色軍用汽車起卸上陸後、亦於昨日下午駛出淞口、現停泊浦中敵運輸艦僅地田丸一艘、停靠黃浦碼頭、尚未駛出、餘皆已駛出淞口返日云、</p>
<h3>敵以空襲首都相威脅益激我殺敵雄心</h3>
<p>字林西報昨著有公正社評　敵欲我屈膝正如痴人說夢</p>
<p>字林報昨載社論、論日第三艦隊總司令長谷川岡以飛機大轟南京事文日、長谷川海軍中將關於日海軍之空軍對南京之意志我各國之正式照會、就南京運來不時受日軍空襲觀之、此似為日軍將作特殊廣大天空行動之一種豫徵、此項照會南京政府處之泰然、未作不平之鳴、正足鼓動上海四周或內地中國軍隊對日本侵略之抵抗、各方消息、均證明政府今憑藉從來所未能達到之政治上的團結、異常穩固、此政府與人民或將因以感激日本者也、</p>
<p>長谷川之言論、如予以正確之解釋、則似表示日方對於此擧所抱之希望、乃在急劇搖動華軍之士氣、因而使政府解體、而引起利於日方之後果、此種臆測、是否能如所望將以此次天空攻勢之結果覘之、實則凡在上海等處出入於華人民衆間者所感受之印象、均不敢阿諛日人之期望.觀於疆塲健兒、作戰若是之忠勇、一般民.衆對於天空之危險、流離之艱苦、若是之堅忍、苟非南京領袖之魄力、遜於若輩、則日人之期望、終必成幻夢也、事有至可注意者、此次戰爭中受難之民衆、對於彼等所以破家蕩産之原因、</p>
<p>知之甚稔、從無一言怨及政府、而咸歸咎日本之侵略、日本高級指揮之圖為近衛首相所述日人在華目的之後盾也、中國民衆之義憤·確為其所當深切考慮之一點、日本軍艦之砲彈、與飛機之炸彈、似將於華人心腔中長留怨毒、而使他日中日兩國間之經濟合作與友誼、寂無應者、日軍取大規模之天空攻勢、或能獲得長谷川心且中所望之迅速結果、然縱令獲得而此種結果、將否踚越華人悲憤忍受之界限、而結果適得其反、仍為一疑問也、</p>
<p>日軍與時俱進、時時對生命財產、作狂暴之摧毀、此種無意識之行動、其入人心也似已愈入而愈深矣、據日本傳來可靠消患、日本人民雖具愛國熱誠、然對於其政府之政策、已呈一種不可搖勸之携貳矣、蓋此種政策、徒對輿日本同負東方文明領袖令譽之綁國、作極恣睢之侵略絕無其他顯明之表示也、日本領袖為其軍閥宣傳之迫切所驅使對於華軍之戰鬥力、極為蔑視、而對於日軍在滬作戰、或將遭遇重大損失之任何進言、則棄諸不顧、他日眞相昭露、不復能掩時、恐日政府將因以陷於進退維谷困難之地位晚已、卽日本軍界中對於此次用兵是否值得一點、亦意見歧異、一般穩重之軍人、深盧此次戰役將減弱將來應付俄彊方面車變之能力而彼主張用兵侵略中國者、則謂今日派往中國之軍隊、多屬後備士兵、至於日軍之精銳、興各種最新之軍備、均留待用於將來更大之事變云云、此種自飾之詞、終不能令人釋然於懷也、縱其說果確、而陸海軍力終屬有限、未能長此消耗而不敝老也、况軍費浩大、債臺高築、終必至不能自安之程度乎、此上述數事之值得注意、已遠勝於發展至可繁人之此次戰爭之初期、蓋戰事初僅限於平津一隅、而今日已擴及中國全面也、日本抱堅决圖華之志、今懝加烈其强襲計劃、遂以南京為其有秩序的破壤之目標、此擧除所已實布之軍事目的外、必將毀及其地之民事建設、中國或將因以益見貧窮、故日本之冒險行動、實無經濟利益之可得、而日軍為達到其所需破壞結果起見、必須遭受重大之損失、更無庸言矣、</p>
<p>在此種環境中、顧請日本頭腦較請之政治家、就大局平凡之事實、作退一步想、而懸崖勒馬、其眞如一般人所謂無效可言乎、卽令華軍之抵抗力、能在一星期內突然瓦解、然日本欲圖使兵所獲、與其在中國海濱所已消耗之努力、得以相稱、仍將有一至重大問題當前待决、假令戰事續繼延長、日軍仍奮力從軍欲令“中國屈膝”之工作、而謂該問題終可設法解决、則正茹痴人之說夢耳、恐嚇之技衛、或能克服將受打擊者之身體的力量、然其報酬、必將於受打擊者之靈魂中創造一種精神上之抵抗、此實無法加以克服者也、此種苦况、日本其能安受乎、（下略）</p>
<p>“譯者按字林報每論列中日戰爭、輒殷殷以兩國宜化干戈為玉帛、同謀人民之福利為言、作者居第三者之地位、發此言論、仁心善意、固可感也、第吾人今已因日本之侵略、受空前之浩劫、生靈塗炭、地方糜爛天人共憤、擧世同情、而彼暴敵且欲將吾人擊至屈膝而後已、吾人非至侵略者不能再對吾人施其侵略之日、决無和平之可言、此時宣傳和平、實屬浪費筆墨、本文末段、復勸告中日兩國早日携手、故從略也、”</p>
<h3>敵恐嚇伎倆失效首都外僑無撤退意</h3>
<p>英軍艦將照常停泊　蘇聯大使决不遷移</p>
<p>字林報云、日第三艦隊總司令長谷川發出對南京作天空轟炸及取其他攻勢方法之威脅後、駐京英美等國之大使署、尚未决定應否遷移出京、京中外人除美人外、昨日（二十日）均未表明態度、（惟蘇聯大使署已聲明决不遷移）美國駐亞艦隊總司令雅奈爾海軍中將曾致函長谷川、聲明美國大使署與任何美僑一日留京、則泊京之美砲艦呂宋號與甘姆號須一日不離、雅氏此函於二十一日晚發出、略謂日總領事轉來照會、謂日海軍之空軍將於二十一日正午十二時後轟炸南京、並勸外閥軍艦移泊南京上游、美砲艦呂宋號與甘姆號現泊江中、興太古公司躉船並行、美大使著與任何美人留京一日、則兩艦亦須留泊一日、兩艦高層鋪有美旗、殊易辨認、請以必要之命令致日海軍之空軍、愼勿在兩艦附近拋擲炸彈、如日陸軍飛機擬在該處附沂拋擲炸彈、請發同樣命令為國云云、聞英國與德意爲大使署現仍留京、法大使署亦擬如是、但正待其政府之切實訓令、字林報現有理由相信英軍艦亦將照常留泊、英大使署之婦孺、刻正在運移中、惟男性職員均擬留署、刻在南京之英軍艦格拉特號與蜜蜂號、將留衛京中之英僑、</p>

<h3>戰時宣傳工作的檢討</h3>
<p>— 鳴</p>
<p>現代國與國間的戰爭。原是各該戰鬬國一切機構發動的總和。平時準備的工作。—國防。—無論軍事的。經濟的。社會的。文化的。皆於戰時一一暴露牠的强點和弱點。此卽所謂全體性戰爭。這是講常理。但也有積弱的國家。情勢上不容許她充份準備。卽被迫應付戰爭的。現在我們奮起抵抗日本侵略戰爭·就是顯明的例子。這次我們應戰而不是求戰。一切機構的散漫無力。不必諱言。但應須追悔警惕。譬如以黨治國。組織不能謂不詳備。推行保甲·政府不能謂不努力。然抗戰一起。漢奸活躍。令人痛恨。又如宣傳設專部。新聞有檢查·也可稱至矣𧗊矣。何如敵人關於我國情的諜報。那詳𧗊的程度。遠非我老百姓所能審悉萬一。這種種事實。似乎均逾越求諒範圍。我上下應本血誠。宜深自反省的。現在全國戮力。共赴國難。當無暇互責。但凡有與戰事直接痛癢相關的。自應披瀝相告。冀謀補苴。今願將文化機構中的宣傳工作。稍加詳述。</p>
<p>我們這次抗戰。文化機構積極的工作。非但發動得極微。並且也覺得太無力。國內敎育界出版界幾陷於全部停頓。國外活動。仍未能免臨時雜湊。再觀消極方面。竟缺乏組織和調遣。且對於缺乏常識的舉動。也未能加以制裁。姑舉一例論之。前數日。有某報用實地攝影傳遞火綫情報相號召。於無意之中。給敵人以情報。使我火綫將士處於焦頭爛額的境地。幾致救神妙布局。完全逆轉。只爲了糊塗蟲、一紙相片而已。戰地一戰壕一火砲。原不足異。假若襯託了背境。烘染了蔭蔽。那麼敵人便可推算地位。測知藏集。加之現代立體戰術。就不難立時毁滅了。試觀上海虹口日人安置砲位。任何人不准窺探。又何等嚴密謹愼。近見十七日中央社路透電。美國新聞片公司攝影員蒙根等。在京攝畢。卽將趕赴中國戰綫後方拍攝戰場實况云云。不禁無限憂慮。然迄未見文化機構稍加注意。稍加論列。豈眞見不及此嗎。</p>
<p>我前方將士保衛國土。殱滅彈敵。種種可歌可泣的姿熊。和當局設備戰地·配置軍力·種種情形。後方民衆和友邦同情人士。皆亟欲審知觀覽。愈詳愈受歡迎。一種熱忱情緒。亦固其宜。報人影人。努力搜求。務使供應這種慾求的滿足。也無可非議。但應知戰鬭一方。欲知對方的狀况和布置。其千方百計需求的熱烈更超乎我純粹崇敬和觀賞的情緒之上。故一篇形容𧗊致的戰地行紀。或一紙奮勇出擊的相片。我人讀了看了。不過感慕欷戲罷了。</p>
<p>若使敵人得了。便發生按圖索驥的妙用。無意中便斷送了我火綫上的將士。筆下鏡頭。報人影人。豈不應有份寸。文化機構豈不應加急切的注意。</p>
<p>我軍政當局。近於前綫慰勞。已訂有限制辦法。甚望於戰況宣傳。無論文字影片。訂以條例。嚴格執行。事前的不令任便。自較事後的審查爲愈多多。這雖是一樁文化機構消極的作用。但未必不是發生積極效力的。因特提出商討之。願文化界多所努力。</p>

<h3>市救濟委員會辦理救濟難民情形（下）</h3>
<p>敵機肆虐</p>
<p>因暴敵之不顧人道、故對於輸送難民車輛及輪船、時加轟炸及掃射、以致難民死於非命者、逹數千人之衆、據該會之報告、八月一十二日由滬開蘇之汽車七輛、經南翔時、被敵機投彈轟炸、死傷難民五六十人、同月二十八日、難民集中南火車站、準備登車出發時、被敵機投彈轟炸、死傷四百餘人、九月五日、在北新涇野雞墩、有小火輪拖帶拖船輸送難民至蘇州嘉興一處、敵機以機槍掃射、死傷六七十人、同月十三日、仍在該處、由小火輪及民船遣送難民、又遭敵機轟炸、傷亡達四百餘人、尚有自動離滬及未經該會登記之難民、所遭敵機轟炸掃射者、尚未計算在內、暴敵之殘酷獻性、於此更可見一般、</p>
<p>給養困難</p>
<p>如許難民、其給養一事、頗爲繁重、負擔更屬非輕、所有難民各項給養之支配與供給、難民衣食之徵集、儲藏及保管、難民給養之一切臨時籌備措置等事項、悉由該會主持、所有難民、每日每人約需米五合、若干收容所內、則每日備飯二次、若干收容所則一飯兩粥、或一粥一飯、大半均有難民輪流自煮、所有米糧、均由會向民食調節會購辦、最近數日所需米糧總數、每日約一百擔左右、</p>
<p>注意疾病</p>
<p>關於難民之疾病問題、該會極爲注意、故特設醫藥組專司其事、該會派在各收容所之職員、隨時留意於難民之健康問題、如發現有疾病、輕者則卽聘義務醫師爲之診治、重者則送難民醫院療治、同時隨時檢查難民之衛生、以預防疾病之傳染、兩租界衛生處、亦特派醫士至各收容所、爲難民種痘及注射防疫針、尚有因病致死者、則另由掩埋組設法棺殮、而此次又以難民時遭敵機轟炸、罹難者尤衆、故掩埋一事、亦較繁瑣、</p>
<p>訓導指示</p>
<p>難民集居一處、終日暇居、一無所事、反感不安、該會爲特利用時間、辦理訓導事宜規定訓導工作大綱如下、（甲）訓導之目的、㊀戰時常識、㊁使其共守秩序、㊂使其明瞭遣散之必要、及較爲安全之區域、㊃喚起各𧗊其能力、㊄生活之指示、㊅决不爲敵人利用、（乙）人員之支配、㊀有知識技能與服務精神者、爲骨幹㊁各界職業、㊂籍貫應屬於何省市、（重在方言）㊃須有關係可以信者、（丙）敎具之設備、㊀每所置收音機一具、㊁揭示牌一具、㊂其他、（丁）訓導之方法、㊀用無綫電向難民播音、㊁用文字圖畫揭示、㊂隨時巡視、隨時隨人口頭開導、（戊）其他應注意之一點、㊀辦事人應態度熱烈誠懇㊁注意難民之行動、以防奸細、訓導組根據該大綱、分別派員至各收容所、負責訓導、</p>
<p>辦理成績</p>
<p>該會工作、頗收時效、所有職員、多係各機關各團體所調用、故均屬義務職、內部人事管理、似較困難、但尚無妨碍整個工作之進行、且一般職員、多半能循例認眞工作、該會經費來源、由社會局抗敵後援會及其他慈善團體機關所負擔、並另由個人方面直接捐助、</p>

<h3>房租移購公債尚待審議</h3>
<p>特區性質特殊　當待詳訂辦法</p>
<p>本市南市閘北及第一第二兩特區、對於政府此次發行救國公債、有市民組主辦其事、日前曾擬普徵一個月房租、購買公債、一般房客、風聞此說、遂有藉詞拒付房租事件發生、記者昨以此事、面詢該隊負責入員、承告本組確有是項計畫、但尚在審議中，將來如何實行、須待提商救國公債勸募總會後、始能决定、且第一第二兩特區、性質特殊、卽在實行時、亦當詳訂辦法、至各房東之深明大義、愛國有素者、頗多自動提出房租一月、認購公債、此種熱情、實可欽佩</p>

<h3>日本經濟財政已入崩潰之塗徑</h3>
<p>農民受徵兵影響無法工作　財政界承銷公債已存觀望</p>
<p>據最近由東京來滬之某西人錢、日政府因滬戰失利、迭在國內强迫徵兵、應徵者以农民與小工商人為最多、此輩僅知出兵、而不知出兵之目的、個人生命事業全部犧牲、極抱反感、有藉故推託、不願應徵者、卽被當局槍决、開拔時亦不許親屬送行、以减少刺激、如家屬有出怨言者、卽停止補助、以示懲戒、因此民間反戰聲浪日益增高、漸有武力無法維持之勢、反戰印刷品、被憲警沒收者甚多、輿論亦受統制、已不足代表人民意志、警廳因左翼乘機活動、現正加緊戰防中、日慶民因受徵兵影響、已無法從事農村勞動、工商業所受之影響雖因戰爭初起、尚未顯著、惟此後物價必然增高、威曾國民生計、至為重大、財政界方面、對於資金調整案、曾經表示反對、承銷公債、亦存觀望、資本家亦曾一度表示反戰、現雖暫時沉默、然恐懼戰局之心理、實無底止、將來戰爭繼續失利、則日本經濟財政、必致整個動搖、終趨崩潰之一途也、</p>

<h3>靑年抗敵救亡國告同胞書</h3>
<p>願影院舞塲聽者</p>
<p>中華靑年抗敵救亡團為持久抗戰、敬吿同胞書、並附帶警告影院舞場老闆們云、自東北四省淪亡到現在、我們已度滿六年羞　與血淚的生活了、在這六年裹、我們無時不在撫摸著這顯創痕、無時不在盼望著復仇的日子、經過了六年的磨折和掙扎、而今、這偉大的日子——全民抗戰——終於來臨了、半世紀來的仇恨、六年來的血債、開姑要洗雪、清算、</p>
<p>“八一三”滬戰的爆發、就是我中華民族爭取解放的序幕、也就是我中華民族到了生死存亡的關頭、要求得這解放興生存、祗有實現政府與民衆聯合起來、發動持久的全面抗戰、而要確保抗戰的最後勝利、則這個關鍵全縣於民衆的力量上、換句說、民衆的力量可以决定抗戰的最後勝利與失敗、</p>
<p>自抗戰發動以來、英勇的戰士們、始終以血肉跟敵人的砲火周旋著壯烈地犧牲著、而民衆方面所表現的是怎樣呢、老實說、這是跟散沙一樣、毫無組織和力量、雖然、有一部份愛國的民衆、正在努力於救難、救濟、募捐、慰勞、參戰等等的工作、但這究竟是極小極少的力量、而且這不能和軍隊打成一片、這不能不說是一種極可慮的現象、</p>
<p>此外、這有一件更可痛心的事、就是不慬民衆亳無組織、甚至這有一部份喪心病狂、祇圖私利的奸商、在干著“向後轉”的勾當、我們决不容忽視、例如自戰區外擴後、特區內竟有幾家影院和舞場、在砲火下復業了、影院映著哥哥妹妹的愛情片子　舞場跳著粉紅黛綠的大腿舞　試問、現在是否已到了“歌舞昇平”的時候　奸商不愛國、甚至於幹著麻醉民衆的勾當、固然是罪不容誅、而去求樂的民衆、罪名並不在他們之下、</p>
<p>諸位、我們應該認清這次抗戰的意義和性質、政府的最高領袖已經說過、“地無分南北、人無分老幼、”“有錢的出錢有力的出力”我們旣無能出錢、就應該出力、各人拿出自己的能力、在政府的領導下、從本位上去努力于救國工作、這樣、至少可以收到“後方民衆有組織”的效果、而政府因無後顧之憂、便可一心一意與敵週旋、持以三年五年、不但毫無困難、這可確保最後的勝利、</p>
<p>那時候、我中華民族獲得解放了、那時候、我們才可以痛痛快快地去亨受正當的人類幸福、何苦在烽火連天的今日去尋窮開心呢、</p>
<p>在這裹、我們不妨和影院老闆們作一個建議、就是趕快改變方針、映幾部激發民族思想的有意義的片子、這樣不但不為民衆所唾棄、並且還有“敎育民衆”的美名、豈非一舉兩得、否則就把原有的院屋改為收容所或傷兵醫院、（滬上已經不乏先例）、</p>
<p>至於舞場、則祇有把它改為收容所或傷兵醫院、敢請舞塲老闆們翻然悔悟、藉表愛國衷誠、最後我們不得不作一個警吿、就是假使仍有執迷不悟、而繼續幹著這種麻醉民衆的勾當者、便是民族的罪人、我們的公敵、</p>

<h3>匯司捕房轄境秩序恢復</h3>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>驕憤餒亂四者。最為兵家所忌。故用兵而四者若有其一。已足挫敗。况兼四者而有之。兵法曰。驕兵必敗。驕必輕敵。輕敵則敗。此其理固人人能知之。及其旣敗。則張脈憤興。怒不可遏。於是不講理智不擇手段。不顧一切。以求一逞。但遇勁敵。堅強抵抗。銳氣一挫莫可　挽回。故曰憤兵。憤怒之師。氣易衰竭。於是而餒。及其旣餒。則軍心動搖。舉措慌。統御無方。兵無鬥志。於是亂矣。兵至旣亂。崩潰立至。現在日本已犯驕兵之忌。更當憤兵之時。傾其全國之師。不惜孤注一擲。以冀挽回頹勢。然而此糧希望。决難達其目的。可以預料。則餒與亂將不旋踵而隨之。</p>

<h3>戰地應用的小工藝</h3>
<p>— 周汝傑</p>
<p>都知道科學一天一天的發達，戰鬥的武器也一天一天的進步，過去原始時代的戰術武器，在近代已完全失去其效力。戰鬥的面積，也逐漸擴大，殺人的方法更是利害，平面戰的時代期，戰爭的範圍，只限於對方在前綫上的參戰士兵。近代的立體戰，空軍已經衝破了平面的範圍，無所謂前方後方。只要戰事一旦爆發，馬上海陸空總動員，就可以把敵方整個的毀滅了。歐戰時期德國利用科學萬能，發明了毒氣戰爭，於是“殺人術”又突飛猛進，當時參戰的國家都受了很大的損害，引起了世界各國對於毒氣戰的注意。各國科學家軍事家都在埋頭研究如何運用毒氣摧毀敵人，如何應用最妥善的方法和設備，防禦毒氣的侵襲，以作第二次世界大戰的準備。</p>
<p>我國枓學本是落后，又受經濟方面的限制，對於毒氣戰爭的準備，可以說“心有餘而力不足。”但是國難已到了嚴重的“最后關頭”，蘆溝橋的砲火，揭開了中日全面戰的序幕，在這整個民𪯶救亡鬥爭時期，防毒的準備，實在是急不容緩的工作。我們知道日本帝國主義者對華侵略，是完全操縱在所謂少壯軍人的法西斯集團的手裹。他們是完全利用戰爭來騙取他們國民的同情，而日本的士兵，或者在平日是養尊處優，生活習慣不能適合於戰場的環境，或者純係新徵士兵，毫無作戰經驗，一旦大戰爆發，來同久經戰役的中國士兵對抗，雖然武器進步，但是士氣不振失敗是必然的結果，等到作戰不利的時候，他們一定會不顧一切，實行毒氣戰爭的。過去淞滬之戰喜峰日之戰以及最近的蘆溝僑之戰日本已經開始運用毒氣戰了。我們已經吃了好幾次虧，若再不早點研究防禦的方法那差不多是坐以待斃。</p>
<p>這裹所稱的幾種防禦毒氣小工藝，以最經濟，最普遍，最簡單為原則，希望各界同胞聽講之後，各自依法製造，更盼望各地民衆敎育館的收音指導員，切實指導民衆大規模的來製造一下，使每個人都能“有備無患”，我們𦆵能在這次戰爭中，得到最後的勝利。</p>
<p>一，防毒衣</p>
<p>現代戰爭所用的毒瓦斯火概是“依配列脫”麋爛性“福斯根”窒息性，“狄福斯根”喷嚏性，“披根林”僱淚性。這幾種各有各的作用，各有各的利害。歐美各國多用橡皮製成衣褲穿在身上防禦毒氣，這種橡皮衣褲價值很高，至少需百元左右，决非一般人民的經濟能力可以辦得到的。這裹介紹的一種防毒衣的製法極為簡單，經濟防毒效力亦佳。</p>
<p>材料：㊀魚油，㊁光油，㊂胡麻子油，㊃燥頭。（這四樣東西在漆鋪子裹可以購買）㊄綢子或布，㊅橡皮帶。</p>
<p>用具：㊀銅鍋，㊁炭爐，㊂木棒，㊃絲頭。</p>
<p>製法：用綢或布製衣褲，袖口及褲脚縫入橡皮帶一條，最后製成衣褲相連的式樣，橡　皮遊藝場裏變幻術的人所穿的衣服，手套，襪子，頭套（如風帽狀各樣東西穿在身上，以不透風為原則，衣服等件旣已做好，這時候用魚油成半，胡麻子油二成半，光油五成，混合煎煮，充分攪和，然後再加燥頭百分之五，再煮一小時，用力攪和均勻，靜置待冷，用絲頭蘸油用力擦衣之正面各部，頭套，手套，和襪子都照樣辦理，擦油后掛在透風的地方吹乾，再照樣擦四五次即成，平時應多練習穿脫，以免臨時手足失措，必慌意亂。）</p>
<p>㊁口罩</p>
<p>上面所講的都是保護全身不被毒氣侵襲，然而口鼻不能用這樣油布，阻碍呼吸。各國多用防毒面具，可是這種防毒面具，決非我們一般同胞的經濟力可以辦到的。既然如此，我們不能不想個補救的辦法，這裹所介紹的口罩，是一般經濟力可以辦到，製法也極簡單。</p>
<p>材枓：㊀碳酸鈉，㊁淸水，㊂脫脂棉，㊃紗布，㊄帶子。</p>
<p>用具：㊀磁盆，㊁大口玻璃瓶。</p>
<p>製法：用碳酸鈉二成，淸水七成混合於磁盆內，待溶解後裝入大口瓶內，用二層紗布當中夾兩層脫脂棉，面積大概四英寸，周圍以布縫好，兩邊釘上帶子。以你全家人口為製造數目，每人最好做兩個，把這製好的口罩放在碳酸鈉溶液裹浸透，遇毒時把這口罩從瓶內取出罩在口鼻上，用帶子繞頭後紮緊，口罩如覺乾燥，趕快更換第二塊。</p>
<p>另一種經濟口罩，比較麻煩一點，但其效力較第一種為佳，有興趣者不妨試驗一下。</p>
<p>材料：㊀舊香烟罐頭，㊁碳酸鈉，㊂毛織品舊料，（如舊毛氈羊毛襪羊毛衫等），㊃脫脂棉，㊄紗布，㊅活性炭，（西藥房買）或木炭末㊆淸水。</p>
<p>製法：將香烟罐頭釘若干小扎，（由內向外釘）再將罐口用手捏成橢圓形，罐口每邊焊一小圈，以便扣帶子。然後用碳酸鈉三成，淸水七成溶液。將紗布脫脂棉浸入液中，這時將舊毛織品放在罐內，然後放活性炭或木炭未一英寸厚，再將紗布棉花從液中取出，放在活性炭上，遇毒時可以罩住口鼻，但罐口宜加一層橡皮或布，這樣一則可以不磨擦皮膚，二則使其密不透氣。</p>
<p>㊂防雨布</p>
<p>在戰爭期內，人民如遇大雨，極感困難。這次蘆溝橋之役，適值大雨傾盆逃難者，莫不叫苦連天，夏季還好，假如在冬季裹，就是不被砲打死，恐怕也要凍死了。我在這裹介紹種防雨布，牠的性質有些像水遇着荷葉似的，簡直一點不沾水，大家可以頂備一下，免得在戰地上遇了大雨受苦。</p>
<p>材料：㊀醋酸鋁，㊁明礬，㊂淸水，㊃長衫或被單。　　用具∶㊀磁盆，㊁研缽，㊂熨斗，（有無均可不過用熨斗燙過，效力更好）。</p>
<p>製法：將醋酸鋁一分，明礬一分，共同研成細末，用淸水五十分調成淸液，將衣服或被單浸在液中十分至二十分鐘，取出晾乾，用熨斗燙平。在逃難時如果遇到下雨，馬上穿在身上，或將被單披在身上，比一般雨衣便利，各界同胞不妨試驗一下。</p>
<p>戰地應用小工藝</p>
<p>㊃衣服消毒藥</p>
<p>衣服用具的消毒都很重要。前面所說防毒衣，如果遇過毒氣，脫下來一定要切實消毒，不然有極大危險。茲將衣服消毒極簡單的藥品及製法詳述於後。</p>
<p>材料：㊀肥皂，㊁蘇打，㊂淸水。</p>
<p>用具：㊀磁盆，㊁橡皮手套或木棒。</p>
<p>配製：將肥皂二百克，蘇打十克，用淸水混合於盆中。先將沾染毒氣衣服在淸水中浸透，再取出放在溶液內，帶上橡皮手套，將衣服搖動，或以木棒撹動衣服，然後取出用肥皂水煮開，再以淸水漂洗即可消毒。</p>
<p>㊄滅火藥水</p>
<p>戰爭時發生火警，是常有的事，尤其是敵人投擲燃燒彈，火患更大，這時家家除多備淸水外，應特別多備滅火藥水，但市上所售滅火藥水，價值很高，不如自製，既經濟又便利，在此非常時期內，家家應該多多配製，以便於發生火警時應用。</p>
<p>材料：㊀汞化錏，㊁汞化鈉，㊂淸水。</p>
<p>用具：大盆或木桶，火油筒。</p>
<p>製法：將汞化錏一兩七錢，汞化鈉二十西淸水二十四兩。（這是配製最低數量，各位如欲多製，可以依此法增加）混合於盆內，再把淸水倒下充分攪和，然後裝入煤油聽內貯在家中，聽上應書明，“滅火藥水”以備隨時應用。</p>
<p>以上所講的幾種小工藝，都是極簡單，極經濟，取材旣極便利，製法又甚容易，希望各界同胞拿牠做一個參考，更希望大家指敎！</p>

<h3>Our Troops Defend the Original Line of Defense, Fierce Fighting in Villages East of Luodian Yesterday</h3>
<p>The enemy's advance on the area of Houjiazhai was repelled by our forces.  The enemy launched multiple attacks on the Zhabei area, all of which suffered disastrous defeats.  Our artillery positions in Pudong shelled the vicinity of the enemy's consulate.</p>
<p>This newspaper received the following confirmed battle reports from the front line last night: ⑴ Southeast of the Municipal Government, the enemy forces had built field artillery positions. Starting from around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, they jointly shelled our positions near Jiangwan.  Due to the lack of targets, all the shells landed in the fields. Our military positions suffered no damage. ⑵ Around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, enemy infantry of five to six hundred men were discovered east of Fudan University.  Enemy infantry of three to four hundred men were also present east of the Jiangwan Ye Family Garden.  In addition, there were six enemy mortars and more than ten tanks east of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, seemingly with some intentions. ⑶ The enemy forces in the Yanghang area launched an attack on our positions near Yangjiufang starting from 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, but they were bravely repelled by our troops, with dozens of enemy soldiers killed or wounded. ⑷ In the Luodian area, since yesterday morning, the enemy forces launched fierce attacks on our positions near Houjiazhai, Jinjiazhai, and Gongjiazhai.  Our troops initially responded calmly and then engaged in trench warfare.  Fierce fighting continued until 3:00 PM that day (the 21st).  The enemy forces suffered extremely heavy casualties, and our certain brigade also suffered casualties. ⑸ The enemy forces facing our certain army on the front lines have been repeatedly subjected to surprise attacks by our troops in the past two days, suffering extremely heavy damage and casualties of over two thousand men. Therefore, starting from yesterday afternoon, the enemy no longer dared to advance, and the number of their artillery pieces has also decreased. In addition, a large number of wounded enemy soldiers were seen facing our certain division, being transported from Fang, and many donkeys and horses were moving eastward from the north of Luodian Town, presumably due to the frustration of continuous attacks, and there is a new plan.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st: Aviation sources report that residents who escaped from Gouqi Mountain, which belongs to Chongming County, said that a Japanese cruiser and a destroyer were anchored west of Gouqi Mountain. Marines landed and strafed the islanders. Except for a portion who fled to Shengshan, the rest were arrested. The situation is tense.</p>
<p>Military News: The enemy forces successively attempted to carry out a central breakthrough in Luodian and Taxiing, but were met with a head-on blow by our troops and have not succeeded so far. In recent days, the enemy has concentrated a large force in the downtown area, attempting to advance on Jiangwan. However, our troops in that area have strong forces and are heavily guarded. If the enemy attacks, they will definitely suffer heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Five Hand-to-Hand Combat Engagements with the Enemy in the Luodian Area</h3>
<p>After suffering repeated heavy blows, the enemy in the Luodian area, although awaiting reinforcements and replenishment, dared not launch a major attack, but has continued to make trouble in recent days. However, our troops have given them a head-on blow each time and launched fierce counterattacks, and are still ensuring the original line of defense and maintaining strict vigilance. It is reliably known that on the afternoon of the 19th, enemy bombers dropped bombs for a long time over the Yangjia Village and Sucun areas, three kilometers north of Caowang Temple in the northwest of Luodian. In the evening, more than ten enemy artillery pieces fiercely bombarded the Shenjia Village, about two kilometers east of Sucun, and the Gushou Village to its north, firing countless shells. At around 11:00 PM, a sudden night attack was launched, with forces of one battalion or more advancing on our Sucun and Gushou Villages. Our troops were prepared and immediately dispatched elite troops to launch a head-on counterattack. The soldiers were exceptionally brave, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat up to five times. The enemy formation was disrupted and fled in disarray. Our troops did not pursue and continued to defend the line of Sucun, Gushou Village, Jiangzhai, and Xisongzhai.</p>
<p>In the northwest of Luodian, there was fierce fighting late at night. Enemy aircraft bombed our military positions in Yangjia Village and Sucun, about three kilometers north of the Chaowang Temple, very intensely from the afternoon. Our military positions in Gushou Village, north of Sucun, were also the target of concentrated enemy artillery fire. Most of the enemy artillery positions were located in Shenjia Village, about two kilometers east of Sucun, and the artillery fire they fired was more than a thousand rounds, bombarding until about 11:00 PM at night. The enemy's infantry began to move, with an estimated force of more than one large detachment fiercely advancing on our Sucun and Gushou Villages. Our troops stood firm and did not retreat. In order to give a head-on blow, they also dispatched a considerable force, leaping out of the trenches to counterattack, charging and engaging in hand-to-hand combat more than five times. Under our fierce counterattack, the enemy suffered casualties all over the field, and the remaining enemy soldiers who were defeated were in a terrible state. Our line of Sucun, Gushou Village, Jiangzhai, and Xisongzhai is exceptionally solid. Yesterday afternoon, enemy artillery bombarded the area around that line again, and our artillery units also returned fire. Last night, a small group of enemy soldiers attempted to attack and harass, and most of them were routed, while the rest were annihilated by our forces.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attack on Liuhang Repelled Again</h3>
<p>The enemy forces have repeatedly attacked our Liuhang, attempting to break through our central line of defense. In recent days, they have been repelled. Fierce fighting broke out in the area of Jialongnong on the 19th, from morning to night. The enemy forces concentrated their artillery fire, fiercely bombarding our positions near Doujialongnong, Mengwan, and Wangjiufang, and constantly sent multiple aircraft to reconnoiter our positions. In the evening, their infantry, under the cover of artillery fire, advanced on us. Our troops bravely fought back, fighting bloody battles all night, and finally repelled the enemy. At dawn the day before yesterday, traces of the enemy were found again in our positions in the Chenzhai, Wangzhai, and Yangjiufang areas, and they attacked us. Our troops responded calmly until noon, when the enemy could not withstand it and retreated one after another. The day before last night, the enemy joined reinforcements in the Jialongnong area, and fierce fighting broke out all night until dawn yesterday morning, when the enemy was forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Military News: Our troops in the Liuhang area have won another major victory recently. After the enemy forces in that area were defeated by us on the 17th, they advanced on our positions with heavy forces from the Yanghang area on the 19th. Our troops responded calmly, and the two sides bombarded each other with heavy artillery and machine guns, and the fierce fighting did not stop for two days and nights. On the afternoon of the 20th, our troops took advantage of the enemy's exhaustion and fatigue, leaping out of the trenches, bravely charging and launching a white-blade bloody battle. The enemy forces could not withstand it and retreated. In this battle, the enemy forces suffered more than 2,000 casualties. As a result, the front line became quiet again yesterday, and the artillery fire gradually became sparse. At the same time, the enemy forces in the Luodian area also moved eastward, seemingly to reinforce the Yanghang side.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attack on Zhabei Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>The enemy forces who have been trapped in the Zhabei to Jiangwan line for 40 days have not only made no progress, but are also becoming increasingly exhausted. If the war effort and morale had not shifted to the Luodian coastal area, the enemy forces in that area would probably have been wiped out by our troops long ago. Although the fighting on that line has continued without stopping in recent days, it has all been skirmishes between outposts, with no fierce battles. At dawn the day before yesterday, the enemy again used five tanks as a vanguard, covering more than 400 infantrymen, and launched a dawn attack on our Dijiabang area along the Tiyuhui Road and the vicinity of Zhoujiazhai. At the same time, the enemy artillery units also fired fiercely, and used a small number of troops to harass the left and right wings of that section in an attempt to achieve their dream of breaking through our defense line in that section. After our troops bravely fought back, the enemy's five tanks suffered heavy damage from the concentrated fire of our flat-trajectory guns, small steel cannons, and machine guns. After fierce fighting for an hour, the enemy finally could not withstand it and retreated in panic, and more than half of the 400-odd infantrymen they covered were killed or wounded. The enemy attacked several times the night before last morning, but gained nothing.</p>
<h3>Enemy's Attempt to Invade Pudong Becomes More Urgent</h3>
<p>First, reconnaissance by low-flying air force, then artillery fire, our artillery counterattack hits near the Japanese consulate.</p>
<p>Yesterday at 4:00 PM, several enemy aircraft reconnoitered at low altitude in Pudong for several weeks, and at about 4:45 PM, enemy warships anchored off the Waibaidu Bridge in Pudong also fired on our Pudong side. Our artillery also immediately opened fire to return fire. Several shells hit near the Japanese consulate, and it immediately caught fire. About twenty minutes later, the sound of artillery fire subsided.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:36 PM, an enemy gunboat rushed from the Yangshupu side to under the Baidu Bridge. At that time, the tide was rising. The ship anchored in the center of the river in front of Lujiazui, with the bow facing the Chunjiang Wharf. It was seen that there were many navy personnel wearing white uniforms running back and forth from the lower cabin to the second and third deck platforms, working very busily. However, observing the situation, it seemed that there was a plan to attack Pudong and plot to smuggle ashore. It took dozens of minutes to park the ship properly, and then most of the soldiers hid in the ship's cabin. The enemy Ship No. 13 was anchored in front of the middle wharf, and the Izumo Ship No. 2 River Tube was anchored to coordinate.</p>
<p>Since the enemy's repeated attempts to land in Pudong have failed, it has been rumored for several days that they will launch a large-scale invasion in the near future in order to eliminate the serious threat posed by our artillery to the Japanese warships, and to take a large amount of coal stored in the Japanese docks along the shore, and then attempt to advance. Unexpectedly, our side discerned their conspiracy and prepared sufficient strong forces and built strong fortifications in advance, so that the enemy's dream of landing became a bubble. And they also knew that they could not easily attack our defense line, so the most tense period in the past five days has become quiet, and there has been no fierce action day and night. Although Japanese aircraft sometimes use machine guns to strafe civilians and throw bombs, and there are intermittent artillery battles between the Japanese warships in the Huangpu River and our artillery, they are all irrelevant to the overall situation, and our troops have not suffered any damage. Since the night before last until this morning, our troops have been waiting in battle formation at all ports along the shore, and it seems that there is no possibility of conflict. According to general observation, the enemy's plan to attack Pudong has not been abandoned, and they have been busy preparing for the past few days.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships on the Huangpu River Come and Go in a Hurry</h3>
<p>Before dawn yesterday morning, three enemy cruisers of more than 10,000 tons sailed to Songkou and are now anchored on the Yangtze River surface outside Songkou, their names being Nino, one Yrno, and the other unknown. All three ships have a dark gray hull, each with three funnels, and two white stripes on the funnels. It is thought that they are carrying enemy reinforcements to Shanghai. In addition, an enemy Red Cross ship also arrived at the same time, also anchored on the river surface outside Songkou, with the ship name American, presumably preparing to carry enemy wounded soldiers back to their country.</p>
<h3>Enemy Forces Arrive with Another Large Batch of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>The total number of enemy transport ships that have successively sailed to Shanghai in recent days has reached more than 50. Apart from a portion used to carry enemy reinforcements to Shanghai, most of them are used to load enemy military supplies and military necessities. Therefore, the enemy's replenishment of military equipment has been quite substantial recently. Currently, the warehouses and wharfs of Osaka, Huangpu, China Merchants Bureau Middle Wharf, North Wharf, Huishan are all piled up with enemy military supplies, and enemy trucks come and go to transport them to various places, which is very busy. As for the enemy Kiyokawamaru, Fifth Unkai Maru, Boryo Maru, and another unnamed transport ship, etc. that sailed to Shanghai successively before, they have left Shanghai one after another and returned to Japan the night before last. And the Liangyou Maru, which was docked at the chemical machine of the China Merchants Bureau, hastily unloaded the military supplies and a large batch of green military vehicles in the heavy rain yesterday, and also sailed out of Songkou yesterday afternoon. Currently, only one enemy transport ship, Chishima Maru, is docked in the Huangpu River, docked at the Huangpu Wharf, and has not yet sailed out. The rest have all sailed out of Songkou and returned to Japan, it is said.</p>
<h3>Enemy Threatens with Air Raids on the Capital, Further Arousing Our Ambition to Kill the Enemy</h3>
<p>North China Daily News published a fair editorial yesterday, enemy wants us to kneel is like a fool's dream.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News published an editorial yesterday, discussing the incident of the commander of the Third Fleet of Japan, Hasegawa Kiyoshi, using aircraft to bomb Nanjing, saying: "The formal notification of all countries by Vice Admiral Hasegawa regarding the Japanese navy's air force to Nanjing, viewed from the perspective of Nanjing being constantly subjected to Japanese air raids, seems to be a precursor to a special and extensive sky operation by the Japanese army. The Nanjing government calmly handled this notification and did not make any complaints, which is enough to encourage the resistance of the Chinese troops around Shanghai or in the interior against Japanese aggression. All sources prove that the government is now relying on political unity that has never been achieved before, and is unusually stable. This government and the people may be grateful to Japan for this."</p>
<p>Hasegawa's remarks, if interpreted correctly, seem to indicate that the hope of the Japanese side for this move is to drastically shake the morale of the Chinese army, thereby disintegrating the government and causing consequences favorable to the Japanese side. Whether this speculation can be realized will be seen in the results of this sky offensive. In fact, the impressions felt by those who come and go among the Chinese people in Shanghai and other places dare not flatter the expectations of the Japanese. Looking at the brave soldiers on the battlefield, fighting so loyally, and the general public, enduring the dangers in the sky and the hardships of displacement with such perseverance, if the leaders in Nanjing are less courageous than them, then the expectations of the Japanese will eventually become a dream. There is something very noteworthy: the victims of this war know very well the reasons for their families being destroyed and their property being lost.</p>
<p>They have never complained about the government, and all attribute it to Japanese aggression. The Japanese senior commanders are planning to back up the goals of the Japanese in China described by Prime Minister Konoe. The righteous indignation of the Chinese people is indeed a point that they should deeply consider. The shells of Japanese warships and the bombs of aircraft seem to leave resentment in the hearts of the Chinese people for a long time, making economic cooperation and friendship between China and Japan in the future silent. The Japanese army's large-scale sky offensive may achieve the rapid results hoped for by Hasegawa, but even if it is achieved, it is still a question whether these results will exceed the limits of the Chinese people's grief and endurance, and the results will be counterproductive.</p>
<p>The Japanese army is advancing with the times, constantly destroying life and property with brutality. This unconscious action seems to be entering people's hearts deeper and deeper. According to reliable news from Japan, although the Japanese people have patriotic enthusiasm, they have presented a kind of unshakeable hesitation towards the policies of their government. This is because these policies are only showing the most arbitrary aggression against the country that shares the reputation of leader of Eastern civilization with Japan, and there is no other clear expression. Driven by the urgent propaganda of its military, the Japanese leaders extremely despise the combat effectiveness of the Chinese army, and ignore any suggestions that the Japanese army may encounter significant losses in the Shanghai campaign. In the future, when the truth is revealed and can no longer be concealed, the Japanese government may be trapped in a difficult position where it cannot advance or retreat. Even within the Japanese military, there are differing opinions on whether this war is worthwhile. Generally, cautious soldiers deeply worry that this campaign will weaken the ability to deal with car changes in the Russian border area in the future, while those who advocate using troops to invade China say that most of the troops sent to China today are reserve soldiers. As for the elite of the Japanese army and all kinds of the latest military equipment, they are all reserved for use in greater events in the future. This kind of self-decoration cannot make people feel at ease. Even if their statement is true, the land and naval forces are ultimately limited and cannot be consumed for a long time without being exhausted. Moreover, the military expenditure is huge and the debt is high, and it will eventually reach a level where it cannot be at peace. These matters mentioned above are more worthy of attention than the development of this war, which is so complex, in its early stages. The war was initially limited to a corner of Pingjin, but today it has spread to the entire China. Japan has a firm determination to plot China, and now it is intensifying its strong attack plan, and is targeting Nanjing as the goal of its orderly destruction. This move, in addition to the military purposes that have already been implemented, will inevitably destroy the civil construction in that place. China may become even poorer as a result, so Japan's adventurous actions have no economic benefits to be gained, and the Japanese army must suffer significant losses in order to achieve the destructive results it needs, which is self-evident.</p>
<p>In this environment, it is requested that Japanese politicians with relatively clear heads think a step back about the overall situation and the plain facts, and pull back from the brink. Is it really as ineffective as people say? Even if the Chinese army's resistance can suddenly disintegrate within a week, Japan will still have a very important problem to be decided in order to make the gains of the troops commensurate with the efforts it has already consumed on the Chinese coast. If the war continues to drag on and the Japanese army continues to strive to achieve the work of "making China kneel," and it is said that this problem can ultimately be solved, then it is like a fool's dream. The technique of intimidation can overcome the physical strength of those who are hit, but its reward will inevitably create a spiritual resistance in the soul of those who are hit, which cannot be overcome. Can Japan accept this kind of suffering? (The following is omitted)</p>
<p>"Translator's note: The North China Daily News always earnestly advises that China and Japan should turn hostility into friendship and jointly seek the welfare of the people when discussing the Sino-Japanese War. The author is in a third-party position and makes these remarks, and the benevolence and goodwill are commendable. However, we have already suffered an unprecedented catastrophe due to Japanese aggression, with countless deaths and injuries, and the devastation of the land, which has aroused the anger of both humans and gods and the sympathy of the whole world. And that brutal enemy wants to strike us until we kneel before stopping. We will have no peace until the aggressor can no longer aggress against us. At this time, publicizing peace is a waste of ink. The last paragraph of this article again advises China and Japan to join hands as soon as possible, so it is omitted."</p>
<h3>Enemy's Intimidation Tactics Fail, Foreigners in the Capital Have No Intention of Evacuating</h3>
<p>British warships will continue to dock as usual, the Soviet ambassador will not move.</p>
<p>The North China Daily News said that after the commander of the Third Fleet of Japan, Hasegawa, issued a threat to bomb Nanjing and take other offensive methods, the embassies of Britain, the United States, and other countries in Nanjing have not yet decided whether to move out of Nanjing. Except for the Americans, foreigners in Nanjing did not express their attitude yesterday (the 20th). (However, the Soviet embassy has declared that it will not move.) The commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, Vice Admiral Yarnell, sent a letter to Hasegawa, stating that as long as the U.S. embassy and any U.S. citizens remain in Nanjing, the U.S. gunboats Luzon and Guam in Nanjing must not leave for a day. Yarnell sent this letter on the evening of the 21st, stating that the Japanese consul general forwarded a notification, saying that the Japanese navy's air force will bomb Nanjing after 12:00 noon on the 21st, and advising foreign warships to move to the upper reaches of Nanjing. The U.S. gunboats Luzon and Guam are currently anchored in the river, alongside the hulks of the Taikoo Company. The U.S. ambassador has instructed that as long as any Americans remain in Nanjing for one day, the two ships must also remain docked for one day. The upper layers of the two ships are covered with U.S. flags, which are easy to identify. Please issue the necessary orders to the Japanese navy's air force to be careful not to drop bombs near the two ships. If the Japanese army's aircraft intends to drop bombs near that place, please issue the same order for the country, etc. It is heard that the British and German embassies are still staying in Nanjing, and the French embassy also intends to do so, but is waiting for clear instructions from its government. The North China Daily News now has reason to believe that British warships will also continue to dock as usual. The women and children of the British embassy are currently being moved, but all male staff members intend to stay in the embassy. The British warships Grate and Bee, which are currently in Nanjing, will stay to protect the British expatriates in Nanjing.</p>
<p>Shanghai Qin Wu Shang Pao said that the naval commanders-in-chief of Britain, France, and the United States stationed in the Far East have both replied to Hasegawa, commander of the Third Fleet of Japan, refusing the application to move foreign warships anchored in Nanjing to the upper reaches of South East China. There is currently one British cruiser and two gunboats in Southern China, and France has one gunboat. Yesterday, a spokesperson for the Japanese embassy in this city claimed that Japan will certainly do its best to protect the lives and property of foreigners, but after Japan issued a warning about the bombing of Nanjing, it cannot be responsible for foreigners who still reside in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury said that The Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury received reliable news last night that the U.S. Ambassador Johnson and about ten members of the embassy staff and employees boarded the flagship Luzon of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet at 9:00 PM on the 20th, preparing to sail to Wuhu. Another U.S. ship, Guam, is also preparing to leave Nanjing, leaving only Second Secretary Paxton to represent the U.S. government in Nanjing. As for the seventeen U.S. civilians traveling in Nanjing, they will stay in Nanjing temporarily with Paxton. It is not known whether they did not have the opportunity to leave Nanjing on the two ships, or whether they were unwilling to abandon their families and businesses. The diplomatic community in Nanjing was greatly surprised last night when they heard the news of the U.S. ambassador and his staff leaving Nanjing. The British, French, and German embassies were particularly uneasy. The three embassies are currently not moving. It is said that Johnson is the leader of the diplomatic corps in Nanjing, and his sudden move is unexpected. It is heard that the Chinese authorities also do not understand the U.S. ambassador's decision. The Luzon and Guam were still anchored in the Xiaguan River at midnight yesterday. As for Paxton's main responsibility for staying in Nanjing, it is to ensure that the U.S. embassy's flag is still flying. Those who agree with Paxton include Associated Press reporter McDonald Daniels and his wife. It is heard that they moved in last night. In addition, there are two American reporters. It is heard that several American female teachers at Jinling University have decided to stay in Nanjing and will not move.</p>
<p>The American-owned Shanghai Evening Post said that Vice Admiral Yarnell, commander-in-chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, told a reporter from The American-owned Shanghai Evening Post today that the United States has decided to leave the two gunboats Luzon and Guam in their current position, that is, outside the hulks of the Taikoo Company. The Luzon will listen to the dispatch of the U.S. Ambassador Nelson. Although the U.S. ambassador has temporarily moved his office to the Luzon, the ship is not sailing elsewhere. However, since the ship is under the dispatch of the ambassador, the movement will be determined by the ambassador. From the appearance of the phenomenon, the U.S. ambassador's move to move the majority of his staff to the ship to work is out of his own initiative. Judging from the telegrams from Washington, the U.S. ambassador's actions have been approved by the U.S. government. It is now believed that the U.S. ambassador's move is not for his personal safety, but to avoid unfortunate incidents with Japan that would damage relations like the British and Japanese.</p>

<h3>Enemy Warships Shell Chiwan Yesterday</h3>
<p>Our Artillery Retaliates in a Fierce Five-Hour Battle - Large Groups of Planes Attack Guangzhou Twice - Our Air Force Intercepts and Shoots Down Five</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] More than three squadrons of enemy planes took off from aircraft carriers near Tangjiawan in the Pearl River Estuary at 6:30 AM on the 21st, and attacked Guangzhou in two groups. Our planes intercepted them, and anti-aircraft guns and machine guns fired in unison, shooting down five enemy planes: two at Longyandong, one at Taihe City, and two at Humen. One of our planes was damaged, and the pilot bailed out by parachute. The enemy planes dropped more than twenty bombs, most of which landed in the fields of the eastern suburbs. The air raid alert was lifted at 8:30 AM. At 1:30 PM, more than twenty enemy planes attacked again, bombing the Xicun area of the Guangdong Railway, but all missed. One was shot down by our forces, and the rest fled. The alert was lifted at 2:30 PM. Enemy warships shelled Chiwan at 9 AM on the 21st, but were also unsuccessful. (21st Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan Threatens to Bomb Nanjing - Britain and the United States Warn Japan</h3>
<p>Should Compensate for Loss of Life and Property - Japan's Unreasonable Demands Have Been Rejected by Britain</p>
<p>[London] Japan's threat to launch a large-scale bombing of Nanjing has aroused the greatest attention since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. (Central News Agency 21st Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Today, Britain instructed Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to Japan, to protest Japan's threat to bomb Nanjing. It is reported that the content of the protest is that this action by Japan may harm non-military institutions and civilian lives. If British lives and property are damaged, Japan should be held responsible. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>[Washington] Acting Secretary of State Moore stated today that the US Ambassador to China, Johnson, had long been instructed by the government that if the safety of embassy personnel was threatened, they could withdraw from the embassy at any time. Therefore, Johnson and the embassy personnel's move to board the USS Luzon was considered to be in complete accordance with the government's instructions. Moore solemnly declared that the State Department does not consider Johnson's actions as abandoning the Nanjing embassy or the qualifications of the US representative in China, as it is only temporary in nature. Moore also summoned the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito, today before the time that Japan claimed it would begin bombing Nanjing. Afterward, neither Moore nor Saito made any statements, but because the timing of the summons was quite coincidental, it is generally believed that the bombing of Nanjing was discussed. Officials at the State Department also do not hide their anxiety about Japan's attempt to extensively destroy Nanjing. It is likely that Moore warned Saito, urging him to pay attention to the huge American property and interests in Nanjing. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the case of the attack on British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen by Japanese aircraft, American political figures recently stated that the Japanese government will issue a formal reply within days, the content of which is reportedly favorable. At this time, the evolution of the Far East Incident, especially Japan's request that British officials, civilians, and warships leave Nanjing, has caused great concern to the British side. Japan should make amends to Britain in the Knatchbull-Hugessen case as soon as possible so that the anxious mood can be slightly alleviated. As for Japan's request, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Herbert Wood, and the Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Fleet, Vice Admiral Charles Little, have rejected it. Upon hearing the news, British political figures expressed strong approval and said that Japan's request was completely unreasonable. The British side will never recognize Japan's right to issue orders or make recommendations to the British authorities within the territory of a third country. Therefore, although Herbert Wood and Charles Little's decision was not instructed by London in advance, the government will definitely approve it. (Central News Agency 20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Asahi Shimbun evening edition reported that Japanese Ambassador to the United States Saito met with US Undersecretary of State Moore on the night of the 20th at Moore's invitation and held secret talks for 30 minutes. Both sides kept the talks secret. It is reported that Moore said that if the American ambassador and expatriates in Nanjing took refuge on a warship and the warship was bombed, American public opinion would be even more unfavorable to Japan. He asked Japan to pay attention and said that if American property was damaged, Japan should be held liable for compensation. Furthermore, the Nichi Nichi Shimbun evening edition reported that the commander of the US Asiatic Fleet replied to the commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, Hasegawa, saying please do not drop bombs near American warships. The British fleet commander replied in the same way. (21st Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>[Nanjing] Since the Japanese military announced that officials and civilians of various countries in Nanjing must withdraw from Nanjing by a certain date, the military and civilians of Nanjing have dealt with it calmly. Their hatred of the enemy has become stronger. A reporter visited Mayor Ma Chaojun and asked about the latest measures. Ma first strongly condemned the enemy's barbaric actions. He then said that Nanjing has made full preparations in terms of transportation, food, drinking water, and fire protection, which are sufficient to cope with all difficulties. Ma finally praised the attitude of some of the elderly, weak, women, and children who remained in Nanjing to leave calmly, and all the young men in Nanjing who firmly expressed their willingness to remain in Nanjing to assist the government.

<p>[Nanjing] The Chinese authorities are extremely indignant at the decision of the American embassy staff to withdraw from Nanjing, because the United States has always refused various requests from China, such as American warships in the Huangpu River in Shanghai not being moored near Japanese warships. As for Japan's wishes, they are more than happy to cater to them. The long-standing friendship of the Chinese people with the United States has now been betrayed, and President Roosevelt even has a unilateral ban on the transportation of arms to the Far East. Seeing this situation, all sectors of the Chinese community are openly hinting at possible retaliatory plans. Chinese newspapers are also extremely resentful. The Chinese authorities issued a semi-official statement tonight, strongly condemning the decision of the American embassy. At the same time, they expressed their appreciation for the reply from the naval commanders of Britain, France, and the United States to Hasegawa rejecting his request that foreign warships in Nanjing be moved to the upper reaches of the river. In their reply, the American commander asked Hasegawa to inform Japanese planes not to affect the American warships USS Luzon and USS Guam anchored in Nanjing. The British and French replies stated that if British and French people were injured or killed in the air raids by Japanese planes, the Japanese side would be held responsible.

<p>[London] According to the Daily Express, after Japan threatened to bomb Nanjing in order to end the Sino-Japanese War quickly, Chinese officials were not shaken at all. Although the Nanjing authorities are fully aware of the dangers of air raids, they are determined not to be intimidated by Japan or feel panicked. According to the Chinese authorities, the damage caused by the Japanese air raids in the past two days has not been serious, which proves that China's aviation facilities can cope with the Japanese air raids. At the same time, the shelters in Nanjing have been completed in a short period of time. As of now, only the American embassy, ​​which is the embassy of the United States in Nanjing, has accepted the Japanese threats. All the staff of the American embassy have moved to the American gunboat "Luzon" to work, and have sailed to the upper reaches of the river. Nanjing officials believe that the American embassy's move is tantamount to "selling out Sino-American friendship." This move has increased the anger of the Chinese people over the United States' announcement of an arms embargo. (21st National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Our Army Fights Bravely Against the Enemy - The Japanese Government Is Increasingly Anxious</h3>
<p>German Doubts Have Arisen About Japan - British Newspaper's Diplomatic Reporter's Powerful Account</p>
<p>[London] Menchesde's authoritative diplomatic reporter, on the basis of information and opinions from various sensitive sources, made a general account, saying that the Chinese people have shown their characteristics, which, although expected by people here, are now making the Japanese government very anxious. Even some Japanese military leaders, who are confident that Japan will win, are deeply troubled by the resistance of the Chinese, which has forced Japan to use a stronger force than originally planned. Japan originally intended to occupy Shanghai with a very small force and devote all its efforts to the northern battlefield, but the resistance of the Chinese army in Shanghai has reduced the Japanese troops that can be used in the north. Japan's victory in North China, even if possible, will inevitably be achieved at a huge price. German observers are now unable to avoid doubting the confidence of the Japanese military authorities that Japan's occupation of North China will weaken the Soviet Union's power in the Far East. The Germans believe that even if Japan obtains a better position on the military road than it does now, its strength is still far inferior to that of the Soviet Union. General opinion in London believes that if Japan had not challenged China, China's unity would never have been as strong as it is today, and even collapse. But today it is not the case. Many believe that China's unity, promoted by greater efficiency in industrialization and administration and the great talent of Chairman Chiang, will be even more excited by the war against Japan.

<h3>League of Nations General Assembly Opens, Litvinov Criticizes Aggressor Nations</h3>
<p>Requests League of Nations Assistance for China and Spain; Australian Representative Proposes International Peace Conference</p>
<p>[Geneva] Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov spoke at the League of Nations General Assembly today, vehemently condemning aggressor nations, saying that two member states of the League of Nations have been innocently invaded, one in southwestern Europe and one in Asia. The latter is China, which was suddenly attacked by Japan without any legitimate reason, blockading its coast and invading its territory with hundreds of thousands of troops, bringing a major global commercial center to a standstill. This kind of action, we see now, is only the beginning. Mr. Litvinov continued, "We cannot help but express reservations when discussing non-intervention in Spain. The three countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations have all attacked other countries in recent years. They have revived the most barbaric of ideas from the long-vanished Dark Ages. Undeclared wars exist on both continents today. If the League of Nations constantly shirks its obligations, it will not be able to maintain its existence. The League of Nations can provide greater assistance than Spain and China have requested. The League of Nations has now received requests for assistance from two invaded member states, regretting only that the United States is not a member state. This application will put the League of Nations to a severe test, but the League of Nations should not shirk responsibility. We firmly believe that if the League of Nations adopts a firm policy in the case of aggression, all other cases can be easily resolved." Australian representative Bruce then took the floor, suggesting that the League of Nations should convene a conference of countries most concerned with the Far East to discuss a solution or unified action. All plans that seem necessary and are in accordance with international norms for the conference should be considered, and non-League members related to the Far East should be consulted at length. Bruce also spoke of the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant regarding actions the League of Nations should take, saying that nothing could be more detrimental to the League of Nations' prestige and future well-being than for the League of Nations to attempt to delay or shelve the current dispute in a meaningless way, merely stating the League of Nations' attitude and position. For the sake of the League of Nations' honor and long-term interests, China must not be misled into believing that it can rely on assistance that is not guaranteed. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Australian representative Bruce suggested to the League of Nations General Assembly today that Article 11 of the Covenant should be invoked to convene a conference of member states and non-member states such as the United States to discuss the Sino-Japanese issue in order to end the war. Bruce also stated that the League of Nations' weakness has rendered sanctions against Japan ineffective. (21st, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>⊙Geneva At the League of Nations General Assembly this morning, after Australian representative Bruce delivered a speech, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov spoke, stating in summary: "Since the League of Nations General Assembly adjourned last year, aggressive actions have not only not ceased, but have even expanded. The war of aggression in Spain has not stopped, and now it is augmented by the war of aggression in the Far East. There has been a prevailing opinion within the League of Nations that if the aggressor is not a member of the League of Nations, then the League of Nations cannot intervene in such aggressive acts. This view is a grave error, as can be demonstrated by the Spanish case. The Spanish case was not submitted to the League of Nations for handling, but to the London Non-Intervention Committee for handling. But the result is already known to everyone. The non-intervention agreement regarding the Spanish Civil War was broken shortly after it was signed. In short, the London Adjustment Committee failed to achieve its original purpose, as it was established for the convenience of non-League of Nations members. From this perspective, those who advocate the universalization of the League of Nations should give it careful consideration. Conversely, if various international conferences and the countries participating in them all share the ideal of peace and are united, then the success of such conferences is often very rapid. The Montreal Conference last year and the Nyon Conference this year are examples of this." Litvinov then vehemently attacked Italy, Germany, and Japan, saying that they had abandoned the ideal of peace and did not respect the independence of various nations. "These aggressor nations often claim to be fighting against communism, but their true purpose is to acquire minerals and markets to promote the sale of their own country's goods. Has the Soviet Union ever refused to trade with various countries? Even with countries whose political systems are mutually opposed, has the Soviet Union ever refused to trade with them? No! What's more, the aggressor nations' so-called anti-communism slogan is aimed not only at the Soviet Union but also at other countries. They often claim that democratic countries are now on the eve of Bolshevization. It is even more absurd to say that the Soviet Union is determined to conquer Spain. What the Soviet Union seeks is to allow various nations to freely decide their internal political systems. Although the Soviet government does not recognize equal rights for both sides in the Spanish Civil War, the Soviet Union has accepted all the agreements proposed by the London Adjustment Committee, including the proposal to withdraw foreign volunteers from Spain. If one were to therefore assume that the Soviet Union is weak and can be bullied, that would be a grave error. As of today, the so-called threat to peace is no longer a question, as peace has already been broken." In addition, Litvinov said in his speech that it was a great pity that the United States had not joined the League of Nations. Litvinov then discussed the issue of revising the League of Nations Covenant, saying, "Several member states of the League of Nations advocate universalizing the Covenant. Their main intention is to prevent the three countries that have withdrawn from the League of Nations, Germany, Italy, and Japan, from being excluded from the League of Nations if the Covenant is revised. However, we must know that if the Covenant is revised, it must be strengthened before it can be effective. The League of Nations still has sufficient effectiveness, as can be demonstrated by two current matters: one is Spain, and the other is China. The governments of both countries have now submitted applications to the League of Nations. The Soviet representative firmly believes that the League of Nations can provide strong assistance to Spain and China. Why can't the League of Nations do this now? It is because we are deeply afraid of arousing the dissatisfaction of agitators and because we are deeply afraid of being scolded by unruly newspapers. Then what will the League of Nations do? Some people therefore believe that the best way to avoid aggression is to concede to the aggressor. If so, then they must remember that after Japan conquered Manchuria, it was followed by Italy's invasion of Abyssinia. The League of Nations' failure to fully prevent the Abyssinian incident led to the occurrence of the Spanish incident, and the League of Nations' inability to do anything about the Spanish incident is the origin of Japan's invasion of China. For this reason, we advocate using the method of collective resistance to deal with aggressor nations. Only then can we realize the ideal of a universal international organization and make the League of Nations a true instrument of peace. There is only one way to make aggressor nations wary and have to return to the League of Nations." (Central News Agency, 21st, Havas)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Discusses Sino-Japanese Issue, United States Decides to Participate</h3>
<p>Appoints Minister to Switzerland to Attend Meeting; Prepared to Consider Resolutions of the League of Nations</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Twenty-Three Advisory Committee is scheduled to meet at 5 PM today to consider the Chinese application. This meeting is purely formal. Beyond further discussion, it is unlikely that any other action will be taken. Foreign Minister Spaak of Belgium is expected to be elected chairman. The committee must first invite representatives from the Chinese and Japanese governments to attend. This may be delayed somewhat. Germany was originally a member of the advisory committee, but now that Germany is no longer a member of the League of Nations, the question of whether Germany should be invited to attend should also be considered. Therefore, the committee will not be able to begin work immediately. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)</p>
<p>[Washington] Regarding the participation of the United States Minister to Switzerland, Harrison, in the Sino-Japanese issue advisory committee in the capacity of observer from that country, the United States government recently issued a press release stating that Minister Harrison has sent a note to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Avenol, stating: "I am ordered by the government of this country to participate in the advisory committee, and the authority I enjoy is the same as that enjoyed by the former Minister of this country to Switzerland, Wilson, when he first participated in March 1933, and my intentions are also the same. Regarding this, Mr. Wilson has already explained in detail in a note sent to the former Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Drummond, on March 13 of that year. The advisory committee was originally established in accordance with the proposal submitted by the then Executive Yuan to the temporary assembly of the League of Nations. In the view of the United States government, its common intention lies in promoting cooperation between member states and non-member states of the League of Nations, so as to implement the resolutions passed by the League of Nations in a unified action and with the same attitude. However, it is difficult to say at this time to what extent the United States government can actually participate before it knows exactly what work the committee is undertaking. In order to avoid misunderstandings, hesitations, ambiguities, and delays, it must be declared in advance that the United States may not be able to assume the responsibilities borne by the member states of the League of Nations. However, the United States deeply believes in the principle of mutual cooperation among countries to resolve international disputes by peaceful means, and therefore is prepared to give great attention to the recommendations that the League of Nations may decide upon. It is not appropriate to state in advance what position the United States government should take." (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Inspects Merchant Ships, France Does Not Recognize</h3>
<p>Japan Accepts Two British Conditions</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the Japanese navy's blockade of the Chinese coast, the French government has recently decided on the following measures: ⑴ In order to avoid disputes, French merchant ships sailing to the Chinese coast should notify the commander of the French Far East Fleet of the ship's name and the names of the shipowner and charterer. ⑵ The commander of the French Far East Fleet should then notify the Japanese naval authorities of the names of the ship's name and the names of the shipowner and charterer. However, France does not recognize the Japanese navy's right to interfere with the free passage of French merchant ships to the Chinese coast. Even if no notification has been given, the Japanese navy cannot interfere. (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese government has agreed to the conditions set by Britain that would allow Japanese warships to stop British ships off the coast of China in order to inspect their registration certificates. According to reliable sources, Britain has stated that it considers the entire procedure to be illegal, but under the following conditions, it does not intend to quibble over legal rights: ⑴ If there is a British warship within one mile, the Japanese warship must first obtain its permission before inspecting the nationality of a British merchant ship. ⑵ If there is no British warship within one mile, the Japanese warship must immediately report the inspection, and the inspection must be limited to checking the registration certificate. The British government also reserves the right to demand compensation for any losses or damages incurred as a result of the Japanese action. (Central News Agency, 21st, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Chiang Kai-shek's Interview with French Reporter</h3>
<p>If Japan's Aggression Does Not Stop, Our Resistance Will Not Stop; Hope the League of Nations Can Take Effective Sanctions</p>
<p>[Paris] The Paris Evening News published an interview with Chiang Kai-shek, stating in summary: The current Sino-Japanese war is the result of Japan's deliberate aggression against China. In order to eliminate aggression and for self-preservation and survival, China has no choice but to resist with all its might. The purpose of the large-scale invasion by the Japanese army is nothing more than to eliminate the entire Chinese nation's survival. Our response should also be aimed at the survival of the entire nation. Shanghai and North China are both Chinese territories and must be viewed as a whole issue. If Japan's armed aggression within Chinese territory does not stop for a day, then China's war of resistance against Japan will not stop for a day. Even if we have only one gun and one bullet left, we must persist in fighting until Japan fundamentally abandons its policy of aggression and withdraws its military forces, which are instruments of aggression. In order to safeguard world peace, human civilization, the dignity of treaties, and the effectiveness of international law, I earnestly hope that the League of Nations will this time earnestly fulfill its obligations under the League of Nations Charter and take effective sanctions against Japan. Japan's atrocities in the six years since 1921 clearly demonstrate Japan's ambition to conquer China and become the leader of East Asia. If the powers still do not take timely measures to curb Japan's aggression, then not only will each country's original trade with China be wiped out, but each country's territory in East Asia will also be seriously threatened. Therefore, sanctions against Japan are not only to help China alone, but also to protect the interests of the member states of the League of Nations and relevant non-member states themselves. I firmly believe that statesmen with a broad vision in various countries will see this and comply with the Charter to sanction Japan in order to fulfill their obligations.

<h3>Hull Speaks Again on American Policy: Neither Leaning Towards Isolation Nor Being Meddlesome</h3>
<p>Willing to Discuss Disarmament and Lowering Tariffs; Hopes Other Countries Respect Life and Property</p>
<p>[New York] Secretary of State Hull spoke at the American Banqueting Hall today on American policy, stating that the policy adopted by the United States today is one that neither leans towards isolation nor readily becomes entangled in foreign disputes. When discussing the issue of the National Socialist movement, Hull believed that if Americans growing up abroad place the interests of other countries above the interests of the United States and accept the command of foreign governments and political parties, then we will never be able to tolerate them. Hull then reiterated that the United States is willing to re-discuss disarmament, reducing trade barriers, stabilizing world currencies, and other issues with other countries. He also stated, "Although we do not want to interfere in others' disputes today, we have never given up on demanding that other countries respect the rights and lives of our people." Finally, Army Chief of Staff Woodring urged American soldiers to sincerely support President Roosevelt and Hull in order to ensure that the United States adheres to a strict policy of neutrality.

<p>⊙Boston Secretary of State Hull spoke at a raw materials allocation conference today, asking the world to facilitate the flow of raw materials so that international trade is no longer subject to undue obstruction. The current situation is so serious that the cloud of war has darkened the world. Therefore, the most important thing for people in the world today is to broaden their minds, expand their vision, refrain from indulging in emotions, have no selfishness, remove old grudges, and trust and cooperate with each other. Only then can we succeed. (20th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>●Boston Secretary of State Hull spoke at a raw materials allocation conference at the National Peace Conference here today, stating that "the shadow of war has darkened the entire world. What the world urgently needs now is faith in promises and the rule of law, and not unreasonable force." Hull further stated that the United States' reciprocal trade agreement plan is a fundamental alternative to the war-breeding politics of economic nationalism and economic isolationism. International trade, as a complement to domestic commerce, is the only way to raise the standard of living throughout the world to a degree that makes the propaganda of cyclical imperialist aggression ineffective. Hull predicted that the unemployment of workers in European armaments factories in the future will become a serious issue and indicated that Europe's surplus should be shipped abroad to exchange for the goods it needs. Therefore, he deeply felt that international trade agreements are the best remedy. (Central News Agency, 20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>●Boston The National Peace Conference discussed the issue of raw materials allocation today and held a banquet at noon. Secretary of State Hull spoke at the banquet, criticizing the economic nationalism of "forcing people to tighten their belts and reduce their expenses" and advocating the abolition of tariff barriers and the restoration of the normal mode of international trade. Countries that pursue a policy of self-sufficiency in economics will "inevitably lower the living standards of their people." In the United States, we should continue to establish commercial agreements with various countries based on the principle of reciprocity, and he said that there can be no lasting peace until the general standard of living in the world is raised to an appropriate level.

According to officials at the John Shipyard, the matter was handled by Mr. Marton of New York, who sold the ships to a Japanese man posing as a Chinese man named Ye, for a price of $184,050. (20th, National Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Washington] According to the Maritime Commission, it has not heard of the matter of the Japanese purchasing three American ships in secret. The spokesman also said that Mr. Marton of New York said after taking pictures of the ships that they were for the Chinese, and later changed it to say that they were for the British. In short, the Maritime Commission has no right to ask who the ships are ultimately for. (20th, National Telegraph)</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Discuss International Monetary Issues</h3>
<p>Rumors of Silver Price Increase; Said to Benefit China</p>
<p>[Washington] British and American financial authorities met with Treasury Secretary Morgenthau for the first time today to discuss international monetary issues. Although none of the participants would reveal the purpose of the meeting, the scope of the discussion was probably to seek a new understanding of monetary issues related to the two countries. Those attending the meeting included British Undersecretary of the Treasury Phillips, British Embassy Counselor to the United States Mallet, and Financial Counselor Thornton, American Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Taylor, and Second Secretary of the American Embassy in Britain Birdwhistell. Silver faction senators today believed that the meeting between Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and British Undersecretary of the Treasury Phillips would consider the London Silver Agreement, which expires in mid-December, and the issue of world silver prices. The issue is quite important to China. After meeting with Treasury officials, one senator said that in his personal expectation, the world price of silver is likely to rise due to domestic and foreign political relations. The Treasury Department may cancel the difference between domestic and foreign silver prices, thereby increasing foreign silver prices. This matter is quite beneficial to China, but to be successful, British cooperation is necessary to prevent India from taking the opportunity to sell in large quantities. As Japan used the opportunity of the United States' purchase of silver two years ago to smuggle huge amounts of silver out of China privately, the United States had to limit its purchases to prevent China from suffering great losses. However, if we were to purchase in large quantities again now, it would be beneficial to China. (20th, National Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Discuss Exchange Rate Issues</h3>
<p>French Finance Minister Broadcasts Speech</p>
<p>[London] French Ambassador to Britain Corbin visited Prime Minister Chamberlain at the Prime Minister's residence this afternoon, ending the conversation after half an hour. According to responsible British sources, the two discussed foreign exchange issues. Regarding this matter, the British and French authorities have agreed to maintain contact in order to protect their respective currencies from being hit by unfair speculation. The exchange rate of the franc against the pound has recently fallen to 147 francs. This drastic change was not economically stipulated by the tripartite currency agreement between Britain, the United States, and France. Although the British responsible parties expressed concern, the British Treasury Department did not protest to the French government. (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas)</p>
<p>[Paris] Finance Minister Bonnet delivered a radio broadcast speech this evening, discussing the current sharp drop in the franc's exchange rate and France's financial situation, stating in summary: "The governments of Britain, the United States, and France signed a currency agreement last September to stabilize their respective currencies through cooperation. The French government is now determined to maintain this policy and must avoid adopting any measures that would isolate the French currency. The government has made many efforts to reorganize public finances in the past, but these efforts are still insufficient. Economic recovery is essential to achieve this. The recent fluctuations in the franc's exchange rate show that the reorganization of public finances has not been fully successful. The monetary system is a reflection of a country's entire activities, and the monetary system can only remain stable by increasing production. Any measures that use the gold reserves of the Bank of France or use exchange controls to maintain an artificial parity of the franc cannot fundamentally solve the problem." Bonnet also issued an appeal to labor and management throughout the country in his conclusion, saying that we must strive to produce, maintain order and discipline, and avoid various disputes. Workers must not slack off, and employers must not close factories. The future of France depends on this. (Central News Agency, 20th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Yan Huiqing's Telegram Delivered to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Distributed to all member states</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Chinese delegation to the League of Nations recently forwarded to the delegations of all member states a telegram from Dr. Yan Huiqing, president of the Chinese Society of International Studies, sent from Shanghai. The content of the telegram requests that the League of Nations, in accordance with the Covenant, immediately take all effective measures to stop Japan's invasion of China, so that the collective security system in the Far East can be preserved and world peace can be maintained. It also stated that China has always been peace-loving. Even after Japan's invasion of China's three northeastern provinces in 1931, China's desire to live in peace with its neighboring countries has not wavered. In the past six years, although China has tried to adjust Sino-Japanese relations through peaceful means, the Japanese warlords have remained unscrupulous in carrying out their plan to seize Chinese land. Now, China's survival has been severely threatened. "The Chinese government and people, in order to defend their territorial integrity and political independence, have no other way to go but to rise up and resist the insults at the cost of great sacrifices. Japan's military actions not only endanger the stability of East Asia, but also have a serious impact on all other countries in the world." (Havas News Agency, 20th, Havana)</p>

<h3>Review of Wartime Propaganda Work</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Modern wars between countries are essentially the sum of the mobilization of all institutions in the warring nations. Peacetime preparation work—national defense—whether military, economic, social, or cultural, reveals its strengths and weaknesses one by one during wartime. This is what is meant by total war. This is common sense. However, there are also weak countries that are forced to cope with war when the situation does not allow them to prepare adequately. The current struggle to resist the Japanese invasion is a clear example. This time we are responding to war, not seeking war. The disorganization and weakness of all institutions are undeniable. But we must regret and be vigilant. For example, we govern the country through the party, and the organization cannot be said to be incomplete. The government cannot be said to be making insufficient efforts to promote the Baojia system. However, since the outbreak of the war of resistance, traitors have been active, which is hateful. Also, propaganda has a dedicated department, and news has censorship, which can be called perfection. How can the enemy's intelligence about our national conditions be so detailed? The degree of detail is far beyond what our people can fully understand. These kinds of facts seem to go beyond the scope of seeking understanding. We should be sincere from top to bottom and reflect deeply. Now the whole country is working together to overcome national difficulties, and there is no time to blame each other. But anything that is closely related to the pain of war should be told frankly in the hope of finding a solution. Now I would like to elaborate on the propaganda work of cultural institutions.</p>
<p>In this war of resistance, the active work of cultural institutions was not only very minimal, but also felt too weak. The domestic education and publishing sectors have almost completely stalled. Overseas activities have still failed to avoid temporary patchwork. Looking at the negative aspects, there is a lack of organization and dispatch. Furthermore, actions lacking common sense have not been sanctioned. Let me give one example. A few days ago, a certain newspaper used real-time photography to transmit front-line intelligence as a gimmick. Unintentionally, it provided the enemy with information, placing our front-line soldiers in a desperate situation, almost completely reversing a cleverly planned layout. It was just because of a muddle-headed paper and a photo. A battlefield, a trench, and a cannon are not uncommon. However, if the background is highlighted and the shadows are rendered, then the enemy can calculate the position and detect the collection. Coupled with modern three-dimensional tactics, it is not difficult to destroy it immediately. Looking at how strictly the Japanese in Hongkou, Shanghai, prohibit anyone from peeking at the placement of their artillery positions, it is so meticulous and prudent. Recently, I saw a Reuters dispatch from the Central News Agency on the 17th, saying that Mr. Mengen and other photographers from an American news film company have finished filming in Beijing and will rush to the rear of the Chinese front line to shoot the actual battlefield situation. I can't help but feel endless worry. However, I have not yet seen cultural institutions pay any attention or comment on it. Is it true that they cannot see this?</p>
<p>Our front-line soldiers are defending the country and destroying the enemy. The heroic and moving postures of all kinds, and the various situations of the authorities equipping the battlefield and deploying military forces, are what the people in the rear and sympathetic people in friendly countries are eager to know and see. The more details, the more welcome. A kind of enthusiastic emotion is also appropriate. Reporters and filmmakers work hard to search for and strive to satisfy this desire. There is nothing wrong with that. But one should know that the fighting party's desire to know the other party's situation and deployment, their frantic efforts, surpass our emotions of pure admiration and appreciation. Therefore, a detailed war diary or a photo of a brave attack, when we read it, we only feel admiration and sigh.</p>
<p>If the enemy gets it, it will have the wonderful effect of following the map. Unintentionally, it will ruin the soldiers on our front line. Under the pen and in front of the camera, should reporters and filmmakers not be careful? Should cultural institutions not pay urgent attention?</p>
<p>Our military and political authorities have recently established restrictive measures for comforting the front lines. I hope that regulations will be established for the promotion of war situations, whether in text or film, and strictly enforced. Preventing arbitrary actions beforehand is much better than reviewing them afterwards. Although this is a passive role of cultural institutions, it may not be the source of active effectiveness. Therefore, I would like to bring it up for discussion, hoping that the cultural community will make more efforts.</p>
<h3>US Accepts Japan's Unreasonable Demands, Anti-Japanese Association Expresses Attitude</h3>
<p>Friendship and Justice are Deceptive Words; Self-Reliance is the Highest Truth</p>
<p>Hasegawa, commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, sent a note to the consulates of various countries in Shanghai on the 19th, stating that he would bomb the capital of China and requested that the personnel of the embassies, residents, and warships of various countries in Beijing move to a safe zone. The attitudes of various countries were very indifferent to this. Only the US Embassy accepted the Japanese request and moved to a warship to work. The reporter visited a certain gentleman of the presidium of the Anti-Japanese Support Association in this city about this matter. According to him, since the war of resistance, Japanese bandits have indiscriminately bombed everywhere, and countless innocent people have been killed. Bombing the capital is not the first time. Each time, planes crash and people die, and they are defeated and retreat. Recently, because the war in Shanghai has been protracted and they have been unable to exert themselves, they have made this threatening remark in an attempt to confuse the people in the rear and also to test the attitudes of various countries. In fact, the will of our country to resist Japan is extremely firm, and it will not end until the final victory is obtained. The enemy's move just shows that their tricks are exhausted. Fortunately, the people of various countries have expressed their sympathy for us, and the diplomats of various countries have also deeply understood the righteousness. They have rejected the unreasonable demands of the Japanese side. Only the US Embassy decided to do so, which is beyond our expectation. In history, the United States has always been able to uphold justice and advocate fairness whenever Japan invades China. Therefore, the spirit of love and affection between the people of the two countries is unusually close. Moreover, the United States has always advocated peace, and in international disputes, it often respects treaties. When the Japanese invaded Northeast China, the United States also participated in the International Advisory Committee and jointly determined that Japan was an aggressor country. Now, the aggressor country is bombing the capital of China with air force, but the United States accepts its warning in reverse. Where is the intention of the dignified ambassador to avoid boarding a warship? It is incomprehensible. Moreover, the United States is the initiator of the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan's invasion of China has destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty. For the sake of increasing the friendship between the two countries, or for the sake of maintaining the dignity of international peace treaties, the United States should assist China and impose sanctions on the violent Japan. However, the United States' prevention of arms exports is no different from secretly assisting Japan, giving China difficulties, and succumbing to Japan's unreasonable intimidation, regardless of the dignity of the envoy. It is a bad precedent in the international community. It is not surprising that Japan is destroying the treaty. The United States is a country that respects treaty obligations. Now, it does not distinguish between right and wrong. It turns a blind eye to Japan's trampling on China's territory and sovereignty, which is really strange. What is the so-called treaty obligation? No wonder the Chinese people are extremely indignant. We are severely stimulated by this and feel that friendship is a false word and justice is a deceptive word. Only by looking at the enemy, making a painful decision, seeking self-reliance for survival, and seeking liberation through self-determination, is the unbreakable truth. In the current anti-Japanese work, we must redouble our efforts and strive for the final victory. As for this improper measure by the United States, I think the American people may not be able to sympathize with it. If the US government does not want to lose this old friend of China for many years, it will be able to correct it automatically.</p>

Is it appropriate? Please discuss the case. It was resolved to pass it and notify the local unions by the name of the Building Fund Management Committee. ㊂ Committee member Zhang Kechang proposed that, at this time of the country's comprehensive war of resistance, it is proposed to telegraph the transportation workers across the country to concentrate their efforts, unite and unite, and resist the enemy for a long time, so as to serve as a backing for the government. Is it feasible? Please decide the case. It was resolved to pass it. ㊃ How should the union express its condolences to the soldiers at the front? It was resolved: 1. Order the local unions to follow the union's 24th notice and handle it immediately. 2. The union will purchase various condolences and send personnel to various wounded soldiers' hospitals to express condolences and pay tribute. ㊄ The Training Department proposed to send a letter to the Directorate General of Posts, requesting the establishment of battlefield post offices in various war zones to emphasize military mail and facilitate transportation. It was resolved to send a letter to the Directorate General of Posts to handle it. ㊅ The General Affairs Department proposed to order the local unions to instruct their members to be faithful to their duties, work hard, and implement savings to store national strength. Is it feasible? Please discuss the case. It was resolved to pass it. ㊆ The Propaganda Department proposed to temporarily suspend publication of the 'Chinese Postal Worker' and change to issuing union reports. Is it appropriate?

<h3>Zhejiang Sericulture Control Committee Purchases Autumn Cocoons in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>Affected by the current situation, manufacturers' purchasing power decreases; Use bank autumn cocoon loans to purchase yourself</p>
<p>This year's autumn cocoons in Zhejiang, Yuhang, Haining and other places have begun to be launched. Due to the climate, the harvest is good. The Zhejiang Silk Control Committee recruits merchants to purchase autumn cocoons in the territory. In addition to the Zhejiang silk manufacturers purchasing as usual, the silk manufacturers and surplus cocoon merchants in Shanghai are unable to purchase. Moreover, the purchase amount of Zhejiang manufacturers has been greatly reduced due to the current situation, and it is bound to cause a surplus of cocoon production, which will have a significant impact on the livelihood of farmers. In view of this, the committee plans to use the 8.5 million yuan autumn cocoon loan from the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Central Bank to organize the 1937 Autumn Cocoon Purchase Committee for self-purchase. The purchased cocoons will be entrusted to various silk factories in Zhejiang Province for reeling, and the reeled silk will be sold directly to foreign countries. The sales matters will be handled by the raw silk sales committee under the committee.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen to be Discharged from Hospital This Week</h3>
<p>Scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 7th of next month; Transfer to East India for recuperation</p>
<p>British Ambassador Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was illegally shot at by Japanese aircraft on the way from Beijing to Shanghai on the 26th of last month, resulting in serious injuries.

<h3>City Relief Committee's Work on Refugee Relief (Continued)</h3>
<p>Enemy Aircraft Rampage</p>
<p>Due to the enemy's inhumanity, they constantly bomb and strafe refugee transportation vehicles and ships, resulting in the deaths of thousands of refugees. According to the committee's report, on August 12th, seven cars leaving Shanghai for Suzhou were bombed by enemy aircraft at Nanxiang, resulting in the death and injury of fifty to sixty refugees. On August 28th, refugees gathered at the South Railway Station, preparing to board the train, when they were bombed by enemy aircraft, resulting in over four hundred casualties. On September 5th, at Yejidun, Beixinjing, a small steamer towing barges transporting refugees to Suzhou and Jiaxing was strafed by enemy aircraft, resulting in sixty to seventy casualties. On September 13th, at the same location, refugees being sent away by small steamers and civilian boats were again bombed by enemy aircraft, resulting in over four hundred casualties. Furthermore, the casualties from bombing and strafing by enemy aircraft among refugees who left Shanghai on their own or were not registered with the committee have not been included in the count. The enemy's cruelty is clearly evident in these events.</p>
<p>Difficulties with Provisions</p>
<p>Providing provisions for so many refugees is a heavy and burdensome task. The committee is responsible for the distribution and supply of all kinds of provisions for the refugees, the collection, storage, and preservation of food and clothing, and all temporary preparations for refugee provisions. Each refugee requires about five "he" of rice per day. Some shelters provide two meals a day, while others provide one meal and two bowls of porridge, or one bowl of porridge and one meal. Most shelters have refugees taking turns cooking for themselves. All rice and grain are purchased by the committee from the People's Food Adjustment Committee. Recently, the total amount of rice needed daily is about one hundred "dan".</p>

<p>The committee pays great attention to the refugees' health problems, and has therefore established a medical group to specifically handle these matters. The committee's staff stationed in the shelters constantly monitor the health of the refugees. If illnesses are discovered, minor cases are treated by volunteer doctors, while serious cases are sent to refugee hospitals for treatment. At the same time, the sanitation of the refugees is regularly inspected to prevent the spread of disease. The health departments of the two concessions have also specially dispatched doctors to the shelters to vaccinate the refugees and administer preventative injections. For those who die from illness, the burial team arranges for coffins and burials. With the refugees constantly subjected to enemy bombing, the number of casualties is especially high, making burials even more complicated.</p>
<p>Guidance and Instruction</p>
<p>Refugees living together in one place, idling all day, feel restless and uneasy. The committee is making use of this time to conduct guidance and instruction activities, with the following general outline: (A) Objectives of Guidance: (1) Wartime knowledge; (2) Ensuring collective adherence to order; (3) Making clear the necessity of resettlement and safer areas; (4) Arousing each individual's abilities; (5) Providing life guidance; (6) Ensuring they are not used by the enemy. (B) Staff Allocation: (1) Those with knowledge, skills, and a spirit of service should be the backbone; (2) Professionals from all walks of life; (3) Their native place should be which province or city (emphasis on dialect); (4) They must be trustworthy individuals. (C) Teaching Equipment: (1) One radio per shelter; (2) One display board; (3) Other items. (D) Methods of Guidance: (1) Broadcasting to refugees via radio; (2) Using text and images on display boards; (3) Constant patrolling, providing verbal guidance to people at any time. (E) Other Points to Note: (1) Staff should be enthusiastic and sincere in their attitude; (2) Pay attention to the refugees' actions to prevent spies. The guidance team dispatches personnel to the shelters to be responsible for guidance, according to this outline.</p>
<p>Results Achieved</p>
<p>The committee's work has been effective. All staff are seconded from various agencies and organizations, so they are all working on a voluntary basis. Internal personnel management seems to be more difficult, but it does not hinder the overall progress of the work. Furthermore, most staff members are able to work diligently and according to established procedures. The committee's funding comes from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Anti-Enemy Support Association, and other charitable organizations, as well as direct donations from individuals.</p>
<h3>The Merger of Three Banks in Sichuan and Kangding into the Sichuan-Kangding People's Bank</h3>
<p>Total Capital Set at Four Million Yuan, General Manager Ning Zhichun to Establish a Branch in Shanghai</p>
<p>The successful merger of the Sichuan-Kangding Development Bank, the Chongqing People's Bank, and the Sichuan Commercial Bank, renamed the Sichuan-Kangding People's Commercial Bank Co., Ltd., began operations on the 21st. The total capital is four million yuan in national currency. The head office is located in Chongqing, with Ning Zhichun as the general manager. A branch will be established in Shanghai, with Zhang Shulin as the manager. All previous claims and debts of the three banks' headquarters and branches will be fully transferred to the new bank from today. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the Shanghai branch yesterday: (1) The Sichuan-Kangding Development Bank opened in September of the 19th year of the Republic [1930], with a total capital of four million yuan, of which 1.5 million yuan was paid up. It was initiated by Lu Zuofu, Liu Hangshu, and others. (2) The Chongqing People's Bank opened in October of the 17th year of the Republic [1928], with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It was initiated by Liu Hangshu, Zhang Zili, and others. (3) The Sichuan Commercial Bank opened in October of the 21st year of the Republic [1932], with a capital of one million yuan. It was initiated by Liu Hanchen, Tang Digong, and others. Now, in order to seek a group organization and expand business, in addition to using the three banks' paid-up capital of three million yuan as the new bank's capital, another one million yuan in new shares will be raised, totaling four million yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>The Proposal to Use Rent to Purchase Government Bonds is Still Under Deliberation</h3>
<p>The Special Nature of the Special Zone Requires Detailed Measures</p>
<p>The Nanshi, Zhabei, and First and Second Special Zones of this city, for the government's current issuance of national salvation bonds, have citizens organizing to handle the matter. It was previously proposed to collect one month's rent to purchase government bonds. Upon hearing this, some tenants have refused to pay rent. Yesterday, the reporter inquired about this matter with the person in charge of the team, who said that the team does have this plan, but it is still under deliberation. How it will be implemented in the future will be decided after consultation with the National Salvation Bond Promotion Association. Furthermore, the nature of the First and Second Special Zones is special, so detailed measures must be drafted when implementing this plan. Many landlords, who are deeply aware of the greater good and have a history of patriotism, have voluntarily offered one month's rent to subscribe to government bonds. This kind of enthusiasm is truly admirable.</p>

<h3>Japan's Economic and Financial Situation Has Entered a Path of Collapse</h3>
<p>Farmers Affected by Conscription, Unable to Work; Financial Circles Adopt a Wait-and-See Attitude Towards Underwriting Government Bonds</p>
<p>According to a Western financier who recently arrived in Shanghai from Tokyo, the Japanese government has repeatedly forced conscription in the country due to its defeats in the Shanghai battle. Most of the conscripts are farmers and small businesspeople. These people only know about going to war but do not know the purpose of going to war. They are extremely resentful of the total sacrifice of their personal lives and careers. Those who make excuses and refuse to be conscripted are shot by the authorities. Relatives are not allowed to see them off when they leave to reduce stimulation. If family members express resentment, subsidies are stopped as a punishment. Therefore, anti-war voices from the people are increasing day by day, and there is a growing trend that force cannot maintain. Many anti-war printed materials have been confiscated by military police. Public opinion is also controlled and is no longer sufficient to represent the will of the people. The police department is intensifying war prevention because the left wing is taking advantage of the opportunity to engage in activities. Japanese farmers are no longer able to engage in rural labor due to the influence of conscription. Although the impact on industry and commerce is not yet apparent due to the beginning of the war, prices will inevitably increase in the future, which is extremely important to the people's livelihood. In the financial sector, opposition has been expressed to capital adjustment plans, and a wait-and-see attitude has been adopted towards underwriting government bonds. Capitalists also once expressed anti-war sentiment. Although they are temporarily silent now, the psychology of fearing the war situation is truly bottomless. If the war continues to be lost in the future, Japan's economy and finances will inevitably be completely shaken and eventually move towards a path of collapse.</p>
<h3>An Appeal to Citizens to Purchase Government Bonds by the Second Special Zone Fundraising Team</h3>
<p>The Crisis is Deep and the Disaster is Urgent, Do Not Hesitate, Do Not Delay, Hoping Everyone Will Subscribe to Increase the Strength of Resistance</p>
<p>The Second Special Zone Encouragement and Relief Team released an appeal to all the citizens of the city yesterday, saying, "All citizens of the Second Special Zone, the ferocious Japanese imperialists have not only seized our Northeastern provinces, but have also invaded our central land. They have sent troops and brutalized the area from Songjiang, making it unbearable and intolerable for us. We have no choice but to temporarily resort to holy war to defend our country. Therefore, this war is truly at the final juncture of life and death for the Chinese nation. We must deeply understand that only with a country can there be a home, and only with a home can there be a life. If the country is lost, our lives and property cannot be preserved. Therefore, if we want to survive, we must contribute all our resources, labor, and capital to the country, especially by actively promoting the purchase of national salvation bonds recently issued by the government to increase our strength to resist the enemy. The total amount of national salvation bonds is 500 million yuan, with an annual interest rate of 4%, and principal will begin to be repaid from the 30th year of the Republic [1941]. Buying government bonds is no different than depositing a long-term deposit in the bank. You can still get interest, you can still withdraw the principal, and you can also express your enthusiasm for saving the country. What could be better? On the other hand, if the country is lost and the family is broken, what is the use of having millions of family assets? Therefore, in addition to actively purchasing national salvation bonds with cash, we should also use gold and silver jewelry to purchase them. To be honest, under such a serious national crisis, these jewelry are really useless. It is better to simply exchange them for government bonds, which can generate interest and save the country. It is truly a win-win situation. Citizens, the crisis is deep, and the disaster is urgent. Let's not hesitate any longer. Get up immediately and actively purchase national salvation bonds to strengthen the strength of resistance and seek our independent survival."</p>
<h3>The Benevolent Society Broadcasts and Solicits Donations for Refugee Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's Committee for Refugee Relief in War Zones will hold a broadcast to solicit donations for refugee relief from yesterday (the 21st) to the 23rd, from 1:00 PM to 8:00 PM at the Fordon Radio Station on Hart Road, and will be broadcast by various radio stations in Shanghai. The program includes Peking opera by Dr. Mei Lanfang and the Zhengyi Society Fanwangdu Club, as well as songs, dramas, and music by Shanghai movie stars.</p>
<h3>Chen Qiming, an Eleven-Year-Old Child, Donates Money for Relief</h3>
<p>The Righteousness Accounts Association is Collecting Old Clothes</p>
<p>Chen Qiming, an eleven-year-old child, saddened by the plight of the refugees, specifically requested his parents to send his four yuan birthday expenses to the Chinese and Foreign Righteousness Accounts Disaster Relief Association for relief purposes. Furthermore, the association is currently collecting old clothing and bedding for refugees to keep warm. The Shanghai Sanrui Hall Fashion Industry Association donated 824 items, the Shifushanzhuang 114 items, and various households in its area donated over 1,000 items, which have been transferred to refugee shelters for distribution.</p>
<h3>A Letter to Compatriots from the Youth Anti-Enemy National Salvation Corps</h3>
<p>A Plea to Patrons of Movie Theaters and Dance Halls</p>
<p>The Chinese Youth Anti-Enemy National Salvation Corps, for the sake of sustained resistance, respectfully addresses this letter to compatriots, and also includes a warning to movie theater and dance hall owners: "From the loss of the four northeastern provinces to the present, we have lived through six years of shame and tears. In these six years, we have been constantly caressing these obvious scars and constantly looking forward to the day of revenge. After six years of tribulation and struggle, now, this great day—national resistance—has finally arrived. The hatred of half a century and the blood debts of six years are about to be avenged and settled.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the "August 13th" Shanghai battle is the prelude to our Chinese nation's struggle for liberation, and it is also the critical moment for the survival of our Chinese nation. To achieve this liberation and survival, we must realize the unity of the government and the people and launch a sustained and comprehensive war of resistance. To ensure the final victory of the war of resistance, the key depends on the strength of the people. In other words, the strength of the people can determine the final victory or failure of the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Since the launch of the war of resistance, the heroic soldiers have always been sacrificing heroically with their flesh and blood against the enemy's artillery fire. What has been the performance of the people? To be honest, it is like scattered sand, without organization or strength. Although some patriotic people are working hard on disaster relief, assistance, fundraising, consolation, participation in the war, etc., this is ultimately a very small force, and it cannot be integrated with the military. This cannot be said to be a very concerning phenomenon.</p>
<p>In addition, there is one more heartbreaking thing: not only are the people unorganized, but there are even some unscrupulous and profit-seeking merchants who are doing "backward" things. We must not ignore this. For example, after the expansion of the war zone, several movie theaters and dance halls in the special zone have reopened under artillery fire. The movie theaters show love films of brothers and sisters, and the dance halls dance with pink and green thighs. May we ask, has the time for "singing and dancing peace" arrived? It is certainly unforgivable for unscrupulous merchants to not love the country and even engage in anesthetizing the people, but the guilt of the people who seek pleasure is no less than theirs.</p>
<p>Everyone, we should recognize the significance and nature of this war of resistance. The supreme leader of the government has said, "Regardless of north or south, regardless of old or young," "Those who have money should contribute money, and those who have strength should contribute strength." Since we are unable to contribute money, we should contribute strength. Everyone should use their own abilities and, under the leadership of the government, work hard on national salvation from their own position. In this way, at least the effect of "organized people in the rear" can be achieved, and the government, without worries in the rear, can concentrate on fighting the enemy with all its heart. If we persist for three or five years, not only will there be no difficulty, but it can ensure the final victory.</p>
<p>At that time, our Chinese nation will be liberated. At that time, we can enjoy legitimate human happiness to our heart's content. Why bother seeking happiness in today's war-torn world?</p>
<p>Here, we may as well make a suggestion to the owners of movie theaters: quickly change your approach and show a few meaningful films that inspire national thought. This will not only prevent you from being scorned by the people, but will also have the good reputation of "educating the people." Is this not killing two birds with one stone? Otherwise, convert the existing theater into a shelter or a hospital for the wounded (there are already many precedents in Shanghai).</p>
<p>As for dance halls, the only thing to do is convert them into shelters or hospitals for the wounded. We dare to ask the dance hall owners to repent and show their patriotic sincerity. Finally, we have to issue a warning: if there are still those who are obsessed and continue to engage in anesthetizing the people, they are traitors to the nation and our common enemy."</p>
<h3>Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>The Number is Still Far From Enough, Hoping All Sectors Will Speed Up the Delivery</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder, and the soldiers on the front lines are fighting hard against the enemy in wind, frost, rain, and dew. The Shanghai Consolation Committee has launched a campaign to solicit donations for "soldier's cotton vests" to protect the health of the loyal and brave soldiers defending the country. In the past few days, thanks to the enthusiastic donations from compatriots in all sectors, the results have been very impressive, but the number is still far from the target of one million pieces. The style of the vests is shown below. It is hoped that enthusiastic women will donate as much as possible so that the target number can be reached in the shortest possible time, thereby enhancing the anti-war strength of the soldiers on the front lines.</p>
<p>Completed Vests Should be Sent to Collection Agencies Soon</p>
<p>According to reports, there is an urgent need for cotton vests on the front lines, which cannot be delayed. Donors can send the completed vests to the Local Association of the China United Building, the Jinli Cotton Cloth Association, the Jingtu Nunnery on Guling Road, the Dahua Dance Hall on Edinburgh Road, or the Consolation Committee of the Ningbo Fellow Association and the City Chamber of Commerce on Yu Qiaqing Road. So that they can be transferred immediately. From now on, send as many pieces as you make each day. If you wait until you have made a whole batch to send out, it will be delayed.</p>
<h3>Simple Style of a Soldier's Cotton Vest</h3>
<h3>Order Restored in the Area Under the Jurisdiction of the Hui Si Police Station</h3>
<p>Curfew Advanced to Maintain Security, Shops Have Resumed Normal Business</p>
<p>After the August 13th Shanghai Battle, the defense of the area north of the Suzhou River under the jurisdiction of the Hui Si Police Station was originally carried out by the International Settlement Volunteers, who piled up defenses on the border of the Chinese area. Later, British regular army soldiers replaced them. Although some residents of the area moved out, most of them remained, and the order was very good. However, in the past few days, various rumors have suddenly arisen, and the police station has advanced the curfew time in the area, starting at 6:00 PM until 6:00 AM the next morning, causing panic among some residents who did not understand the truth. According to the reporter's investigation, there are two reasons why the police station advanced the implementation of the curfew north of the Suzhou River: (1) to prevent residents from being in danger of being hit by stray bullets while staying in the roads at night; (2) after dark, thieves take the opportunity to commit crimes, and theft cases occur daily. Therefore, advancing the curfew prevents thieves from acting. Therefore, since the implementation of this ban, the number of people hit by stray bullets in the Hui Si Police Station area has been reduced day by day, and the number of theft cases has also been reduced a lot compared to before. The rumors have been dispelled. This morning, I went to inspect and saw that the shops in the area have resumed normal business, and many residents have returned. The vegetable market on Aierjin Road has been temporarily closed, but the vegetable market on North Fujian Road is still open as usual. A section of Kaifeng Road is set up by rural women, selling a large number of vegetables, and the prices are not expensive. The defenses in the area are also extremely strong. Therefore, the situation in the area is actually much better than it was two weeks ago.</p>
<h3>Hengli Bank Officially Begins Liquidation Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Decision Was Made at Yesterday's Shareholders' Meeting</p>
<p>After the suspension of business of Hengli Bank, an extraordinary shareholders' meeting was convened yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Taichang Company on Nanjing Road. The chairman of the board, Le Zhenbao, reported that after the bank suspended business, an extraordinary shareholders' meeting was convened on the 30th of last month, but it was declared invalid because the quorum was not met. The board of directors decided to convene another extraordinary shareholders' meeting today. Now the shares present have reached the legal quorum. Please decide on the future of the bank. Then, the meeting began to discuss and decide to proceed with liquidation, and designated accountant Pan Xulun and lawyer Wu Linkun as liquidators. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Cholera Spreads in the Concession</h3>
<p>As of the 20th of this month, the following is a list of the total number of patients in the hospitals in the Public Concession who have been confirmed to have cholera by microscopic examination and the number of people who have died from cholera. The months include all patients from August 30th. However, those who do not live in hospitals in the Public Concession are not included. In addition, there are 909 patients who are suspected of having cholera.</p>
<h3>The Relief Committee Sends Over Nine Hundred Refugees</h3>
<p>Various Fellow Associations Continue to Send Refugees</p>
<p>On the 20th of this month, the Refugee Sending Team of the City Relief Committee sent 590 refugees on behalf of various fellow associations and 330 refugees from the committee's shelters, totaling 920 people. They were transported to Suzhou at 3:00 PM on more than a dozen tugboats of the Yongchang Shipping Company.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Fellow Association in Shanghai, in order to handle the matter of poor fellow villagers returning to their ancestral homes in Guangdong, has been registering at the Guangzhao Guild Hall in the Shanghai Bank Building on Jiangxi Road since the 12th of this month. It has been ten days, and more than 7,000 people have registered so far, mostly women, children, the elderly, and the weak. Adult fellow villagers are waiting to be processed in the future. Furthermore, the association will decide on ships tonight. Please pay attention to the advertisements in the Shen and Xin newspapers.</p>
<p>The Jiangyin-Wuxi Joint Relief Association has been working hard on shelter and repatriation since August 13th. It has sent more than 26,000 refugees back to their homes before and after. Yesterday (the 21st), the 16th batch still hired Shenlong Shipping and towed nine civilian ships, transporting 1,500 refugees back to their homes.</p>
<p>The Wuxi Fellow Association Wartime Service Corps' Repatriation Team chartered a ship from the Xiexing Shipping Company today to transport a thousand people back to their homes. The Shelter Team now has fewer fellow villagers in Shanghai and wishes to establish five shelters. Three places have temporarily suspended shelter. There are still more than 3,000 refugees in the two places, Zhejiang Road and Stealing Chicken Bridge, and will continue to be sent away.</p>
<h3>The Relief Committee Seeks to Relieve Refugees in the Tai-Jia-Bao Area</h3>
<p>Those Who Have Not Been Sheltered Can Go to the Committee Themselves, and It is Hoped That People From All Walks of Life Will Guide Them Along the Way</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the refugees in the Tai-Jia-Bao area have suffered the most from the war. It is difficult for the City Relief Committee to find ways to send a whole batch of rescued refugees to Shanghai for shelter. However, most of the refugees in these areas fled from the war zone in a hurry, leaving behind their families. Therefore, there are often small groups of two or three people wandering around Shanghai, even wandering the streets for days without a full meal. The situation is very pitiful. Now, in order to find ways to take care of them, the City Relief Committee is not only providing relief at any time, but also intends to record it in the newspaper to announce to these refugees that if they have not been sheltered, they can go to the shelter group on the first floor of the Pudong Building to request relief. Arrangements will be made immediately to avoid wandering. It is hoped that people from all walks of life, if they see them along the way, will direct them to the committee, which will also be a great merit.</p>
<h3>A Member of the Battlefield Rescue Team Injured While Rescuing Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Yu Hongjiao, the captain of the Chinese Battlefield Rescue Team, led his team to Baziqiao on the 9th to rescue wounded soldiers, and was strafed by enemy aircraft with machine guns, causing nurse Huang Fuhua, number 57, and team member Li Hongwen, number 20, to be injured. They were sent to the Southeast Tiren College for treatment by the team. It is now known that Huang Li was only slightly injured and has recovered. She was discharged from the hospital at 1:00 PM yesterday. According to the nurse's words to the reporter, "As long as we have a breath, we will continue to work hard and not fall behind others."</p>

<h3>Rear Hospitals Urgently Need Cotton Quilts</h3>
<p>The National YMCA Military Service Department is providing services to wounded soldiers in rear hospitals. Because the weather is getting colder, the hospitals are in urgent need of cotton quilts. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will actively donate as much as possible. Donors are requested to send them directly to the YMCA at 131 Museum Road so that they can be transferred to various hospitals for use.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhizhong's Reply to the Anhui Fellow Association</h3>
<p>General Commander Zhang's reply to the Anhui Fellow Association said, "Chairman Yang, Committee Member Wang, Vice Chairman Xu, Committee Member, and all colleagues of the Anhui Fellow Association in Shanghai: I have received your respectful telegram with respect and admiration. Since the Japanese bandits have shown their violence in Shanghai, the city has been reduced to ashes. There are many fellow villagers here who have been displaced. You are concerned about your hometown and cannot bear to sit idly by. You have been diligently planning and operating to relieve the困厄. Your enthusiasm and righteousness are deeply admired. If my humble efforts can help, I will obey. I am especially grateful, and I hope you will understand. Zhang Zhizhong, humbly, respectfully."</p>

<h3>American Missionaries Reluctant to Withdraw</h3>
<p>Charitable Work Becomes Even Busier, Chinese Christians Host Regular Banquets to Express Gratitude</p>
<p>The American government previously ordered American citizens in Shanghai to withdraw. However, American Christian missionaries in Shanghai are reluctant to easily abandon the charitable work they have been engaged in for decades. Moreover, since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, charitable work has become even busier. Therefore, they have decided to stay in Shanghai and not withdraw. Chinese Christians in Shanghai are moved by the enthusiasm of the American missionaries. Therefore, they have specifically arranged a banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA at 6 PM this Friday to express their gratitude.</p>
<h3>Famous American Reporter Comments on Modern Chinese Soldiers</h3>
<p>Says They Are Now Respected by the People and Bravely Kill the Enemy</p>
<p>Famous American reporter Hal Fothner published an article in the Shanghai Evening Post last night, describing in detail the bravery of Chinese soldiers in combat and the determination of the Chinese people to resist the war. The original text is quite long. The following is a selection of key excerpts translated: "The Chinese people have traditionally looked down on soldiers. As the saying goes, 'Good iron is not used to make nails, good men do not become soldiers.' This is a manifestation of this mentality. Since the brave resistance of the 19th Route Army and two brigades under the 5th Route Army against the Japanese during the January 28th Incident, Chinese soldiers have begun to be admired by the people. The bravery and fearlessness of Chinese soldiers in combat is driven by their hatred of Japanese militarists. People around the world have praised them in unison. The Chinese people, due to Japan's continuous aggression, have also realized the need to build a unified nation. Now China has declared its unification. The nation has a total of two million soldiers, ready to resist the Japanese to the end. Many foreign observers believe that although the Japanese military is stronger, in the current war, the final victory will ultimately belong to China. At the same time, the Chinese people are well aware that if they do not want their motherland to become a Japanese colony, then resistance is almost inevitable. Therefore, in recent years, China has been actively preparing. Various movements, such as the New Life Movement, have stimulated the patriotic enthusiasm of the Chinese people. The whole nation, regardless of age, is determined not to submit to Japan, no matter the cost. Although China has not yet reached the point of perfect preparation in terms of material resources, in terms of psychological preparation, every patriotic person is fully prepared. At present, all political differences have been put aside, and the whole nation is united and willing to fight to the death with Japan under the leadership of Chairman Chiang. Chinese soldiers have, for the first time, learned that the people's hearts and minds are behind them."</p>

<h3>Enemy Still Attempts to Break Through the Central Front Line and Invade Lufubridge, Repelled by Our Forces</h3>
<p>Driven Back Two Kilometers, Enemy Deaths and Injuries Litter the Field, Fierce Fighting at Mengwan and Zhangzhai in Liuhang Area Yesterday, Artillery Fire Exchanged Between Our Forces and the Enemy from Zhabei to Jiangwan</p>
<p>The following is a report from the front lines obtained by this newspaper this afternoon: (1) The enemy's three general offensives have failed, and they are currently actively reinforcing. Their main force is still concentrated in the Liuhang area, attempting to implement their central breakthrough plan to cut off our rear lines of communication. We have long deployed heavy troops on this line, taking steady steps and building a solid defense. The enemy will never succeed. (2) The enemy has been shelling our Liuhang Lufubridge positions for a day and night without stopping, with approximately several thousand shells fired. Our army has suffered minimal damage. (3) The fighting in the Liuhang area has been concentrated between Mengwan and Zhangzhai in recent days. The enemy has launched several fierce attacks, but we have calmly repelled them, advancing and retreating strategically. Numerous melee combats have taken place, unfolding in the most intense bloodbath. We are holding firmly to our fortified positions, and the enemy's corpses litter the field. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (4) In the Luodian area, approximately 1,500 to 1,600 enemies are attacking our Susun area positions. After several hours of fierce fighting, the entire enemy force has been routed. (5) In the Jiangwan and Zhabei areas, artillery battles are fierce. The enemy repeatedly harasses us with small units, but we wait for opportunities to attack. There have been no changes to the original front lines.</p>
<p>(Exclusive Interview by This Newspaper) The following is an excerpt from the battlefront news obtained this morning: (1) The bloody battles between Liuhang and Gujiazhai have been extremely fierce in recent days. Last night, our artillery positions bombarded Yanghang fiercely, firing over a thousand shells from 2:00 AM to 9:00 AM. The enemy's defensive lines were destroyed by us and showed signs of retreat. The enemy forces in that area have built artillery fortifications and also bombard us fiercely every day. However, their targeting is not as accurate as our army's, so we have not suffered much damage. (2) As of 4:30 AM this morning, we have advanced three or four li from Liuhang to Yangbang Bridge and its neighboring Gaojia Bridge, Sujiazhai, and other places, holding firmly to the river. The enemy dares not cross the river, and the distance between us is about seventy or eighty meters. (3) The night before, when the enemy launched a major offensive near Liuhang, our rear reinforcements arrived continuously and launched a fierce attack. After about an hour, the enemy forces could not withstand it and retreated one after another. Finally, a large enemy detachment (one battalion) was cut off from their retreat route and surrounded on three sides by us. They surrendered, and we seized over four hundred rifles, ten machine guns and small mortars. Enemy military organization was found among the prisoners. Each squad consisted of twenty-four men, with the squad leader, deputy squad leader, and two first-class soldiers being Japanese. Three, four, six, or seven men in each squad were from the Northeast. Since their defeat in this battle, the enemy has not dared to launch an easy offensive for two days. The villagers in the Liuhang area have long been dispersed. Those who remain, apart from the extremely poor and elderly, are mostly not good people. Recently, we uncovered two major spy dens and detained over sixty people, all of whom confessed without being beaten.</p>
<h3>Lufubridge Bayonet Fight</h3>
<p>Enemy Shells for Three Hours, We Suffer No Damage, Enemy Attempts to Approach Our Positions, Are Painfully Repelled and Driven Back</p>
<p>In the Liuhang area, fierce battles continue incessantly. The enemy forces are still carrying out their plan to break through our central front line, attacking our positions in the Liuhang area particularly fiercely. At 3:00 AM yesterday morning, the enemy concentrated its artillery fire and launched a fierce bombardment of our positions near Lufubridge, firing over a thousand shells. After shelling for three hours, until dawn yesterday morning, the enemy infantry began to advance on our positions. Our army responded calmly, waiting for them to advance to in front of our positions before suddenly leaping out of the trenches and launching a painful counterattack, charging forward fiercely. Under the heroic charge and bayonet fight of our army, the enemy retreated one after another, and we drove the enemy back about two kilometers. Enemy deaths and injuries littered the field, and abandoned weapons were everywhere.</p>
<h3>Fierce Bloody Battles at Zhangzhai and Mengwan</h3>
<p>As of This Morning, Still Deadlocked with the Enemy at Yangjiufang</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM yesterday morning, over twenty enemy aircraft circled and reconnoitered over our Youmeizhai positions, followed by bombing. At the same time, their artillery units also began to move, bombarding us. Our army suffered minimal damage. Towards 7:00 or 8:00 PM in the evening, the enemy forces facing our Zhangzhai line launched a fierce offensive. The artillery fire was extremely fierce, and tanks also shielded their infantry charge. Our army rose up to meet them, showing no fear, and engaged them in battle. In the end, because the Zhangzhai position was too exposed and vulnerable to attacks from three sides, it was not easy to defend. The fierce fighting continued until about midnight when our reinforcements arrived, and the bloody battle began again. As of this morning, we are still engaged in fierce fighting and deadlock with the enemy in the Yangjiufang and Wangjiufang areas. At 1:00 AM last night, enemy artillery fire also fiercely attacked our positions in the Mengwan area, and infantry also attempted to advance. Our army bravely resisted, and the enemy failed to succeed. By about 2:00 AM, the enemy suffered too many casualties and could not withstand it, collapsing and retreating.</p>
<h3>Enemy in Luodian Attacks Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting at Susun Positions Continues Until This Afternoon</p>
<p>The enemy still cannot forget their dream of breaking through Luodian, and have repeatedly suffered heavy blows from our army. The number of their elite troops lost in that area accounts for over half of their total. However, the enemy's ambition has not died, and they still focus on that line, waiting for reinforcements and resupply, not daring to launch a large-scale offensive, but the fighting continues constantly and has not stopped. Last night, the enemy again began to attack our positions facing them in that area. Our army rose up and launched a fierce counterattack. The sounds of machine guns, rifles, and mortars did not cease all night. At the same time, approximately 1,500 to 1,600 enemies north and south of Susun attacked our Susun positions. Fierce fighting has continued until this afternoon and has not yet stopped.</p>
<h3>Artillery Battles on Both Sides Between Zhabei and Jiangwan</h3>
<p>Exchanged Fire Since Last Night Until This Morning</p>
<p>The enemy on the Zhabei and Jiangwan line has been constantly firing on our positions with artillery since last night. Our army also returned fire accordingly. The two sides exchanged fire until this morning. However, there was no major contact between infantry, and there have been no changes to our front lines.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Scout Everywhere This Morning</h3>
<p>Also Open Fire on Refugees with Machine Guns, Many Injured, Truly Inhumane</p>
<p>Starting at 8:00 AM today, two enemy aircraft flew from the Pudong area to scout, then flew low and strafed passersby with machine guns, flying from Lujiazui to Yangjiadu Tangqiao South Wharf, crossing the river to the Nanshi area to scout, and then returning along the same route. At the same time, they also scattered absurd leaflets.</p>
<p>According to refugees who escaped from the Pudong area and spoke to a Dagongshe reporter, at about 7:00 AM this morning, two enemy aircraft scouted in the Pudong area and flew very low. At that time, many refugees were trying to come to Shanghai, which was seen by the enemy aircraft, which then used machine guns to indiscriminately strafe downwards. It is reported that many people were injured, which is truly inhumane.</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Twice Raid the Capital Through the Tunnel</h3>
<p>Our Air Force Intercepts Them in the Suburbs, Twenty-Odd Enemy Aircraft Break Through and Enter the Skies Over the Capital, Four Enemy Aircraft Shot Down by Our Air Force, Several Fires in the City Extinguished</p>
<p>[Nanjing] 10:00 AM this morning, the Nanjing City authorities issued an alert stating that a large squadron of thirty or forty enemy aircraft were flying to attack the capital. A large number of our aircraft immediately took off and flew to the suburbs to intercept them. The air battle was extremely fierce. At 10:30 AM, over ten enemy aircraft broke through and appeared in the skies over the capital. For a time, dense anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns fired into the air, and several were shot down by us. The exact number is still being investigated. Our losses are still minimal. There were several fires in the south of the city and the northwest corner, which were quickly extinguished. The alert was lifted at 11:20 AM. (Urgent telegram from the afternoon of the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] There were approximately sixty enemy aircraft in total that attacked the capital this morning. After a large number of our aircraft took off to intercept them, about twenty-odd aircraft managed to reach the skies over the capital. As a result, four were shot down by us. Two fell in the suburbs, one fell in Xiaguan, and the other fell in Daxinggong. The aircraft bodies were completely destroyed, and the pilots were all killed on the spot. Our losses were minimal. (Urgent telegram from 1:00 PM on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] When enemy aircraft attacked the capital for the first time this morning, bombs also fell near the American Embassy in Gulou, making a loud noise. Fortunately, the American Embassy was unharmed, and the staff remaining in the embassy were only frightened. An additional four enemy aircraft were shot down, with one falling in Daxinggong, one falling in Pukou, one falling in Xiaguan, and one falling in Mao'er Mountain. (Urgent telegram from 2:30 PM on the 22nd)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 1:20 PM this afternoon, the Nanjing City authorities issued a second alert stating that dozens of enemy aircraft were attacking the capital for the second time. At the same time, our air force immediately flew out to engage them. At about 2:00 PM, several enemy aircraft again managed to reach the skies over the capital. For a time, our anti-aircraft guns and artillery roared. The enemy aircraft frantically dropped bombs aimlessly and then flew away. Our losses were minimal. The alert was lifted at 2:45 PM this afternoon. More details to follow. (Urgent telegram from 3:30 PM on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Indiscriminate Bombing Violates Public Law, Britain and the United States Lodge Protests with Japan</h3>
<p>British Embassy Determined Not to Leave Nanjing, United States Declares Policy Toward China Unchanged</p>
<p>[London] After the announcement of Japan's plan to bomb Nanjing on a large scale, Britain will lodge a protest with the Japanese government. Responsible parties here recently declared that the contents of the protest include three points: (1) British warships will never leave the waters of Xiaguan. As for the British Embassy, it is a diplomatic agency of Britain stationed in a friendly country and will never leave Nanjing. (2) Britain does not recognize Japan's right to make such requests or recommendations to British authorities within Chinese territory. (3) If British lives are lost or British property is damaged, the right to demand compensation will be reserved. British political figures recently believed that Britain is determined to maintain all its rights. This protest is intended to warn Japan, but it may not affect Japan's attitude.

<h3>Enemy Continues to Send Reinforcements, Part of Which Has Already Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>One Division and One Brigade, Approximately 40,000 Men in Total</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that it has been forty days since the enemy invaded Shanghai. Not only has there been no progress, but they have also repeatedly encountered strong resistance from our army. The total number of deaths and injuries, including the regular army, as well as the Taiwan Army, Korean Army, and puppet Manchukuo Army, is approximately 20,000. Therefore, in order to actively replenish their forces to facilitate another large-scale invasion, the enemy continues to seek aid from within the country. Currently, one division and one brigade, totaling approximately 40,000 men, have been sent as reinforcements. A portion of them has already been transported to Shanghai by three enemy cruisers and multiple transport ships. The cruisers are still docked outside the Wusongkou, attempting to land at various ports along the Yangtze River. As for the Huangpu River, two enemy transport ships, No. 286 Sakaemaru and No. 224 Toyokawamaru, sailed in at around 6:00 AM this morning (22nd), docking at the Osaka and Huangpu wharves. Approximately 3,000 enemy reinforcements wearing yellow uniforms landed and boarded eighty or ninety trucks parked on the wharf, heading towards the Hongkou area.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee Holds First Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Decides to Invite Representatives from China and Japan to Attend, Meeting Postponed Until Next Monday</p>
<p>[Geneva] The Advisory Committee on the Sino-Japanese Problem of the League of Nations General Assembly held a short meeting at 6:00 PM today. The Latvian Foreign Minister Mantis was elected as chairman, and it was decided to invite China, Japan, Australia, and Germany to participate in the work. The committee is currently planning to continue the meeting next Monday (the 27th of this month). If these countries can provide answers in Geneva by then, the meeting date may be advanced. It is not certain. A Harveys Agency reporter recently learned that China will accept the invitation to participate in the work of the Advisory Committee, but Japan will definitely refuse and will explain the reasons for the refusal. Currently, the Japanese government is quite uneasy about the League of Nations' intervention in the dispute between China and Japan. This can be seen from the fact that the country's observers are now actively promoting it in Geneva. The Advisory Committee was originally composed of twenty-three countries: Britain, France, the United States, the Soviet Union, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Spain, Sweden, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, Portugal, Ireland, Mexico, Colombia, Guatemala, Panama, and Canada. Germany has already withdrawn from the League of Nations, so it must be invited. As for inviting Australia, it was advocated by Britain. (Central News Agency telegram from Harveys on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull stated today that the United States has protested to Japan against the Japanese bombing of Nanjing. The reasons for this protest are as follows: (1) Bombing non-combatants is contrary to international and humanitarian public law. (2) Bombing will endanger the American diplomatic representatives stationed in Nanjing, thus hindering the normal relations between China and the United States. At the time the United States raised this protest in Tokyo, the State Department was unaware that Britain had also taken the same action. (Reuters telegram from Washington on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>American Ambassador Withdraws from Nanjing</h3>
<p>Evening Star Publishes Article Criticizing, Considers It a Base Humiliation</p>
<p>[Washington] An editorial in the Evening Star today criticized the withdrawal of the American Ambassador from Nanjing, saying that this ungraceful retreat is entirely the fault of Washington. This is not only ungraceful but is also considered a base humiliation, which is not appropriate for a major country like the United States. What is particularly disgusting is that the United States took this action under threat, while other countries such as Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Germany, and Italy have all decided not to leave Nanjing. (Reuters telegram from Washington on the 21st)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement stating that with regard to Japan's plan to bomb Nanjing on a large scale, US Ambassador to Japan Grew was ordered to protest to the Tokyo government. At the same time, the State Department also lodged a similar protest with the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Saito. The basis for this American protest is the provision of international law prohibiting the bombing of ordinary people. Hull further mentioned the matter of the American Embassy in China moving to a warship in the waters of Xiaguan, saying that diplomatic relations between China and the United States have not been interrupted as a result, and the United States' policy toward China has not changed. As for the whereabouts of Ambassador Johnson and the embassy staff, he does not need to ask about them. The relationship between the United States and the Chinese government remains exactly the same as when Ambassador Johnson was stationed at the American Embassy in Nanjing.

<h3>Japan Submits Formal Reply Regarding the Case of the British Ambassador Being Wounded by a Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>[London] Responsible parties recently confirmed that with regard to the case of British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen being attacked by a Japanese aircraft, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has submitted a formal reply to British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive. The contents of the reply are not yet known. (Central News Agency telegram from Harveys on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks Zuoyun Without Success</h3>
<p>Fierce Fighting for Two Days Without Progress, Enemy Changes Direction and Moves North of Zuoyun</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] Frontline telegram at 11:30 AM on the 20th, on the 18th and 19th, over a thousand enemy infantry and cavalry, and over a dozen tanks and armored vehicles, attacked Zuoyun. After two days of fierce fighting, the enemy was unsuccessful. They then increased the number of armored vehicles to over fifty and moved in the area north of Zuoyun. Thirty or forty enemy tanks and armored vehicles were also discovered in the Wujiayao area. (Exclusive telegram on the 21st)</p>
<h3>Enemy Aircraft Attack Guangzhou Three Times in Twenty-Four Hours</h3>
<p>Third Attack Was This Morning at Around 3:00 AM, Dropping Many Bombs in the Northeast Area of Guangzhou</p>
<p>[Guangzhou] Several Japanese aircraft, the number of which is unknown, flew to the northeast area of Guangzhou at 3:10 AM this morning, dropping ten to twenty bombs. This was the third attack by Japanese aircraft in twenty-four hours. Chinese aircraft rose to engage them, and anti-aircraft guns also fired into the air. The sound rumbled, and residents were awakened from their sleep. (Reuters telegram from Guangzhou on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Short Commentary</h3>
<p>— Phase</p>
<p>Pride, anger, starvation, and chaos. These are the most feared by military strategists. Therefore, if a military operation has even one of these, it is enough to cause failure. How much more so if it combines all four? Military strategy says, "A proud army will be defeated." Pride leads to underestimating the enemy. Underestimating the enemy leads to defeat. This principle is known to everyone. But when defeat comes, one becomes agitated and angry beyond control. Thus, one disregards reason, uses any means, and ignores everything in order to achieve one's goals. But when encountering a strong enemy, strong resistance, and a decline in morale, there is no turning back. Therefore, it is said to be an "angry army." The spirit of an angry army is easily exhausted. Thus comes starvation. When starvation comes, morale wavers, actions become chaotic, command is ineffective, and soldiers lack the will to fight. Thus comes chaos. When the army becomes chaotic, collapse is imminent. Japan has now committed the sin of a proud army and is in a state of angry soldiers. It is pouring its national army into the war, gambling everything in the hope of reversing the decline. However, this hope will definitely not achieve its goal. It can be predicted that starvation and chaos will soon follow.</p>

<h3>Small Handicrafts for Battlefield Application</h3>
<p>— Zhou Rujie</p>
<p>Everyone knows that as science advances day by day, so do the weapons of war. The tactics and weapons of the primitive era have completely lost their effectiveness in modern times. The area of battle has also gradually expanded, and the methods of killing have become even more deadly. In the era of planar warfare, the scope of war was limited to the soldiers participating in the battle on the front lines of the opposing side. In modern three-dimensional warfare, the air force has broken through the planar boundaries, and there is no longer any distinction between front and rear. Once war breaks out, the army, navy, and air force will immediately mobilize, and the entire enemy can be destroyed. During the European war, Germany used the omnipotence of science to invent poison gas warfare. As a result, the "art of killing" advanced by leaps and bounds. At that time, the participating countries suffered great losses, which aroused the attention of countries around the world to poison gas warfare. Scientists and military experts in various countries are burying themselves in research on how to use poison gas to destroy the enemy, and how to use the most appropriate methods and equipment to defend against poison gas attacks in preparation for the Second World War.</p>
<p>Our country's science is inherently backward, and it is also restricted by economic factors. The preparation for poison gas warfare can be said to be "willing in spirit but lacking in strength." However, the national crisis has reached a serious "critical juncture." The artillery fire at Lugou Bridge opened the prelude to the full-scale Sino-Japanese war. During this entire period of national salvation struggle, preparation for gas defense is an urgent task. We know that the Japanese imperialists' aggression against China is completely manipulated by the so-called fascist group of young officers. They are completely using war to deceive the sympathy of their people, and the Japanese soldiers, either are pampered in peacetime and their living habits are not suitable for the battlefield environment, or they are purely newly recruited soldiers with no combat experience. Once a war breaks out, they come to confront the Chinese soldiers who have been through many battles. Although the weapons are advanced, the morale is low, and failure is inevitable. When the battle becomes unfavorable, they will definitely disregard everything and implement poison gas warfare. In the past battles of Shanghai, Xifengkou, and the recent Lugou Bridge, Japan has already begun to use poison gas warfare. We have already suffered several losses. If we don't study defense methods earlier, it is almost like sitting and waiting for death.</p>
<p>The several kinds of poison gas defense handicrafts mentioned here are based on the principles of being the most economical, the most universal, and the simplest. I hope that after listening to the lecture, compatriots from all walks of life will manufacture them according to the law, and I hope that the radio instructors in the public education centers in various places will earnestly guide the public to manufacture them on a large scale, so that everyone can be "prepared for a rainy day." Then we can win the final victory in this war.</p>
<p>1.  Gas Mask Suit</p>
<p>The poisonous gas used in modern warfare is probably "Iprite," a blistering agent; "Phosgene," an asphyxiant; "Diphosgene," a sneeze agent; and "Picrin," a lachrymatory agent. Each of these has its own function, and each has its own advantages and disadvantages. In Europe and the United States, rubber is often used to make clothes and pants to wear on the body to defend against poisonous gas. This kind of rubber clothing is very expensive, costing at least about a hundred yuan, which is definitely beyond the economic capacity of ordinary people. The method of making a gas mask suit introduced here is extremely simple, economical, and the gas protection effect is also good.</p>
<p>Materials: ㊀ Fish oil, ㊁ Tung oil, ㊂ Sesame oil, ㊃ Siccative. (These four items can be purchased in paint shops.) ㊄ Silk or cloth, ㊅ Rubber band.</p>
<p>Tools: ㊀ Copper pot, ㊁ Charcoal stove, ㊂ Wooden stick, ㊃ Silk thread.</p>
<p>Method: Make clothes and pants with silk or cloth, sew a rubber band into the cuffs and trouser legs, and finally make a style in which the clothes and pants are connected. The clothes, gloves, socks, and hoods (such as hood-shaped items) worn by the illusionist in the rubber playground are worn on the body, and the principle is to be airtight. After the clothes and other items are made, use half of the fish oil, two and a half of the sesame oil, and five parts of tung oil, mix and boil them, stir them thoroughly, then add 5% of the drier, cook for another hour, stir vigorously and evenly, let it stand to cool, dip the silk thread in oil and vigorously wipe each part of the front of the clothes. Headgear, gloves, and socks are all handled in the same way. After wiping the oil, hang them in a ventilated place to dry, and then wipe them four or five times in the same way to complete them. Usually, you should practice putting on and taking them off more often to avoid being at a loss and confused at the critical moment.</p>
<p>㊁ Mask</p>
<p>The above is all about protecting the whole body from being attacked by poison gas. However, the mouth and nose cannot be covered with such oily cloth, which would hinder breathing. Most countries use gas masks, but these gas masks are definitely beyond the economic means of our average compatriots. Since this is the case, we have to think of a remedy. The masks introduced here are affordable for the average economic means, and the manufacturing method is also extremely simple.</p>
<p>Materials: ㊀ Sodium carbonate, ㊁ Clean water, ㊂ Absorbent cotton, ㊃ Gauze, ㊄ Straps.</p>
<p>Tools: ㊀ Porcelain basin, ㊁ Large-mouthed glass bottle.</p>
<p>Method: Mix 20% of sodium carbonate and 70% of clean water in a porcelain basin. After it is dissolved, pour it into a large-mouthed bottle. Use two layers of gauze with two layers of absorbent cotton in the middle, with an area of about four inches. Sew around with cloth and nail straps on both sides. Use the number of your family members as the number of masks to be made. It is best to make two for each person. Soak the finished mask in sodium carbonate solution. When encountering poison, take out the mask from the bottle and cover it on the mouth and nose. Tie the straps tightly around the head. If the mask feels dry, quickly replace it with a second piece.</p>
<p>Another type of economical mask is a little more troublesome, but its effectiveness is better than the first type. Those who are interested may wish to try it.</p>
<p>Materials: ㊀ Old cigarette cans, ㊁ Sodium carbonate, ㊂ Old woolen fabric (such as old felt, woolen socks, woolen sweaters, etc.), ㊃ Absorbent cotton, ㊄ Gauze, ㊅ Activated carbon (bought from a drugstore) or charcoal powder ㊆ Clean water.</p>
<p>Method: Nail several small holes in the cigarette can (nail from the inside to the outside), and then pinch the can mouth into an oval shape by hand. Solder a small ring on each side of the can mouth to buckle the strap. Then use 30% sodium carbonate and 70% clear water solution. Soak the gauze and absorbent cotton in the liquid. At this time, put the old woolen fabric in the can, then put one inch thick of activated carbon or charcoal powder, then take the gauze and cotton out of the liquid and place it on the activated carbon. When encountering poison, you can cover your mouth and nose, but a layer of rubber or cloth should be added to the can mouth, so that it will not rub against the skin and make it airtight.</p>
<p>㊂ Rainproof cloth</p>
<p>During wartime, people feel extremely difficult when encountering heavy rain. During the Lugou Bridge battle, it happened to be raining heavily, and the refugees were all complaining. Summer is fine, but if it is in winter, they may freeze to death even if they are not killed by artillery fire. I am introducing a kind of rainproof cloth here. Its properties are somewhat like water encountering lotus leaves. It simply doesn't stick to water at all. Everyone can prepare one to avoid suffering from heavy rain on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Materials: ㊀ Aluminum acetate, ㊁ Alum, ㊂ Clean water, ㊃ Long shirt or sheet. Tools: ㊀ Porcelain basin, ㊁ Mortar, ㊂ Iron (optional, but the effect is better with ironing).</p>
<p>Method: Grind one part of aluminum acetate and one part of alum into fine powder, and mix them with fifty parts of clean water to form a clear liquid. Soak the clothes or sheets in the liquid for ten to twenty minutes, take them out, let them dry, and iron them flat with an iron. If you encounter rain while escaping, put it on immediately or drape the sheet over your body, which is more convenient than ordinary raincoats. Compatriots from all walks of life may wish to try it.</p>
<p>Small Handicrafts for Battlefield Application</p>
<p>㊃ Clothing disinfectant</p>
<p>Disinfection of clothing and utensils is very important. The gas mask suit mentioned above must be thoroughly disinfected after encountering poisonous gas, otherwise there is great danger. The simplest medicines and methods for disinfecting clothes are described in detail below.</p>
<p>Materials: ㊀ Soap, ㊁ Baking soda, ㊂ Clean water.</p>
<p>Tools: ㊀ Porcelain basin, ㊁ Rubber gloves or wooden stick.</p>
<p>Preparation: Mix 200 grams of soap and 10 grams of baking soda with clean water in a basin. First soak the clothes contaminated with poisonous gas in clean water, then take them out and put them in the solution. Put on rubber gloves and shake the clothes, or stir the clothes with a wooden stick, then take them out and boil them in soapy water, and then rinse them with clean water to disinfect them.</p>
<p>㊄ Fire extinguishing liquid</p>
<p>Fires are common during wartime, especially when the enemy throws incendiary bombs, and the fire hazard is even greater. At this time, in addition to preparing plenty of clean water, every household should especially prepare plenty of fire extinguishing liquid. However, the fire extinguishing liquid sold on the market is very expensive, so it is better to make it yourself, which is both economical and convenient. In this extraordinary period, every household should prepare more to be used in case of fire.</p>
<p>Materials: ㊀ Ammonium mercuric chloride, ㊁ Sodium mercuric chloride, ㊂ Clean water.</p>
<p>Tools: Large basin or wooden bucket, kerosene can.</p>
<p>Method: Mix one tael and seven mace of ammonium mercuric chloride, twenty parts of sodium mercuric chloride, and twenty-four taels of clear water. (This is the lowest amount to prepare. If you want to make more, you can increase it according to this method.) Mix them in a basin, then pour in the clear water and stir thoroughly, then put them in a kerosene can and store them at home. The can should be marked with "Fire extinguishing liquid" for use at any time.</p>
<p>The several small handicrafts mentioned above are all extremely simple, extremely economical, and the materials are extremely convenient to obtain, and the manufacturing methods are very easy. I hope that compatriots from all walks of life will take them as a reference, and I hope everyone will give us guidance!</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Important Talk: Resistance and National Salvation Depend on Self-Reliance</h3>
<p>Recalling the Past Sino-American Friendship, Feeling Infinite Regret and Indignation</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, yesterday issued an important speech saying, "China and the United States, the two major republics, are located in the two major hemispheres of the East and West. Both are peace-loving and justice-upholding nations. For decades, they have maintained good relations. This time, China is resisting Japan in order to defend peace and resist aggression. It is expected that the American nation will be able to give deep sympathy and righteous assistance. Unexpectedly, when our country notified the embassies of various countries to inform their warships to avoid approaching Japanese warships, the United States refused. When Japan notified various countries to allow foreign warships to moor in the upper reaches of Xiaguan in the Yangtze River, it acted alone. Comparing the two, it is clear that there is a distinction between them. At the same time, the President of the United States issued an order banning the shipment of military supplies to China and Japan, equating the resisters of aggression with the perpetrators of aggression. No wonder the Washington Post of the United States also expressed opposition to this ban. We feel infinite regret and indignation for this kind of action by the United States, recalling the past friendship. We deeply hope that the American people will quickly correct it and pass on the glorious history of the two major nations forever. Furthermore, our compatriots should also be aware that resistance and national salvation depend on self-reliance. Dr. Sun Yat-sen showed us that we should unite with the nations of the world that treat us equally and strive together. After careful examination of his instructions, we must first rely on ourselves to fight together with others. Second, only with nations that truly treat us equally can we unite. The facts are like this. I hope that our compatriots will always understand this teaching and become more and more vigorous."</p>
<h3>Boy Scout Zhang Yaosheng is Brave and Commendable</h3>
<p>Bravely Captured a Bandit on Avenue Edward VII. The Public Works Department Awarded Zhang a Silver Shield in Recognition</p>
<p>Zhang Yaosheng, a member of the Shanghai Youth Boy Scout Corps, is extremely brave and does not avoid difficulties in handling affairs. On the 12th of this month, he was passing through the intersection of Avenue Foch and Chongqing Road when a robbery occurred at the Dahua Motor Company on Avenue Edward VII. The bandit Chen Zhengyu refused to be arrested and fled. Zhang bravely stepped forward and hugged him and sent him to the Chengdu Road Patrol Station. It is now known that the General Police Department of the Public Works Department believes that Zhang is commendable for his righteousness and has specially made a large silver shield, which was awarded to Zhang yesterday. It is also heard that Wang Gang, the head of the corps, also specially made a medal of honor as a gift to encourage him.</p>
<h3>First Board Meeting of the Wartime Popular Education Corps</h3>
<p>Resolved to Establish Public Schools and Support National Salvation Drama Education</p>
<p>Since its establishment on the 16th of this month, the Shanghai Wartime Popular Education Service Corps has been actively carrying out all popular education work. The first board meeting was held the night before last (20th). Nine directors, including Shen Tilan and Deng Yuzhi, attended. Yang Dongchun was elected as chairman and Fang Yu as the recorder. Nine important cases were discussed and decided. Among them, the most important ones were the immediate establishment of ten alley schools, street children's schools, and public schools, as well as supporting the "Children's Troupe" to step up the promotion of national salvation drama education to awaken the people's resistance to the enemy and national salvation. The second training course has also been decided to be prepared and will be officially opened within a week.</p>
<h3>Municipal Secondary Schools Plan to Jointly Move to the Interior</h3>
<p>Jingye and Wusong Will Move to Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>In view of the Shanghai environment, the six municipal secondary schools, including Wuben and Xinlu, cannot continue to start school for a while, and the students are wasting time and abandoning their studies, which is not a long-term plan for the war of resistance. Therefore, there is a proposal to jointly move to the interior to start school. The method is being drafted. It is also learned that Jingye Middle School of the municipality will jointly move to Lanxi or Yongkang, Zhejiang with Wusong Middle School to continue running the school. The school is currently located at the National Light Middle School, and is conducting a survey of students' will to see if they are willing to go to school with them, or plan to transfer or borrow from other schools.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments of Various Service Corps</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cultural Circle Inland Service Corps, a total of 23 members of the corps, including three female members, were divided into three teams. Liu Naifu was appointed as the head of the corps, and they took the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Jiaxing at 7 pm on September 13. At that time, it was raining continuously, and the 31st bridge (between Songjiang and Shihudang) was destroyed by the enemy, and the train could not pass. All the members got off the train and trudged through the rain in the dark. They arrived in Jiaxing the next morning. On the morning of the 16th, they walked in the rain to promote the situation of the war of resistance to the villagers along the way. The results were quite good. At 2 pm, they arrived in Puyuan and convened an expanded propaganda meeting in the Chamber of Commerce. Hundreds of people attended the meeting. The corps explained the awareness of the war of resistance, the situation of the war of resistance, and the future of the war of resistance, and sang national salvation songs. The next day, each team went to the streets to promote the propaganda, and a national defense art exhibition was held in the Chamber of Commerce, including woodcuts, paintings, and war of resistance photos, which were able to inspire the people's morale. In the afternoon, at the invitation of Jiaxing Puyuan Elementary School, Tongxiang Central Elementary School, and the Changdi Strong Men Cadre Training Office, they attended lecture meetings and taught national salvation songs and common sense of first aid and air defense. It is heard that after the corps performs the plays "Put Down Your Whip", "Save a Bullet", "Refugees and Soldiers" on the 18th, it will set off to Tongxiang according to the planned route. The Shanghai Youth Battlefield Service Corps is working hard on the battlefield. The rescue team enters and exits the war zone to rescue the wounded soldiers, and the results are quite good. Since being incorporated into the Fifth Emergency Rescue Team of the Red Cross, the work has become extremely intense. In order to adjust the physical strength of the team members and increase their effectiveness, they have implemented a grouping rotation system. It is also heard that the corps believes that propaganda work is also important, and plans to organize a propaganda team, which is divided into two groups, one staying in Shanghai and the other in the interior. It is being planned. According to Chu Erfeng, the head of the corps, the frontline battles have been fierce in the past few days, and the wounded soldiers have been sent to □□ Hospital for bandaging and then sent to the interior. □□ Talking about the frontline soldiers of our army, they often talk to the frontline outposts of the enemy army. They are all our Northeastern compatriots who were deceived and forced by the enemy to come to Shanghai. When they are fighting, they fire their guns into the sky and wait quietly for the opportunity to revolt. In addition, all the expenses of the corps are self-raised, which is very costly, and the economy is not enough. We hope that people from all walks of life and colleagues in the soy sauce industry will give us financial assistance, such as cars. Dry food, raincoats, medical supplies, Bāguà yuán (a type of medicine), Rén dān (a type of medicine), etc. are urgently needed. The corps address is No. 40, Shouxiang Lane, Fangbang Road, Nanshi.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Youth Singing Team has launched the organization of a wartime service corps, with a communication office at No. 51, Lane 71, Burton Road. Member registration is being handled. If any members have changed their address due to the war, please send a letter to notify us so that we can train them and then send them to work in various places.</p>

<h3>Rushing to Make Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>Women's Groups Undertake 50,000 Pieces</p>
<p>Various women's groups in the city met and agreed to donate 50,000 vests for the soldiers. It is heard that more than 20 groups, including the Women's Comfort Group, the Women's Movement Promotion Association, and the YWCA, are carrying out the work separately, and it is expected that a considerable number will be completed within the day and collected and handed over to the Comfort Committee. In addition, the Comfort Committee will issue formal receipts for the donation of cotton vests to verify the facts.</p>
<p>YWCA Seeks Members to Participate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Christian Youth Association is urgently in need of a large number of cotton vests for the brave soldiers fighting against the enemy on the front lines to keep them warm. It is now seeking to have members, family members, or neighbors and friends sew them. We hope that they will actively participate in the rush to make them so that they can be forwarded to the front lines. All those who participate in the work should collect the cloth from the association and bring it back to rush to make it. Each time, the maximum should not exceed five days. The faster the better. However, please donate the cotton, which costs about two dimes per piece.</p>
<h3>McTyeire School Alumnae Discuss Wartime Affairs</h3>
<p>In view of the increasingly serious situation and the need for long-term resistance, the Shanghai McTyeire School Alumnae Association has decided to hold a meeting of all alumnae at the Shanghai YWCA at 323 Moore Road, Jing'an Temple Road, at 4 pm on Friday, September 24, to discuss the work that should be done during the war. It is expected that patriotic alumnae will attend at that time.</p>
<h3>The Dairy Industry in Shanghai's War</h3>
<p>Dairy Farmers Generously Donate Milk, Benefiting Countless Needy Infants</p>
<p>The 13 dairy farms in the city have been directly affected by the outbreak of the war. Several dairy farmers in the war zone have transported their cows to safe places, but there are still those who have not left the dangerous area. The losses are still difficult to accurately estimate. Baoda Farm suffered the most damage. All the real estate, machinery, and stored milk were sacrificed under the bombs. However, although most of the dairy farms have been damaged, there is no shortage of milk in the concession. In the beginning of the outbreak of the war, there were still about 5,000 pounds left every day, because many milk subscribers left the concession. For the sake of patients in the teaching hospitals and a large number of malnourished children and poor people, the Public Works Department of the Public Concession contacted various dairy farmers to donate milk. One dairy farm agreed to sell it at a reduced price, and the rest of the dairy farms generously supplied the stored milk free of charge. From August 21 to September 15, a total of 14 dairy farms, including Columbia Farm, Liyuan Farm, Standard Milk Company, and other enthusiastic dairy farmers, provided 6,409 pounds of milk free of charge. The Public Works Department of the Public Concession distributed the milk donated by the manufacturers as appropriate and sent personnel to various hospitals. The patients in Renji Hospital and Gongji Hospital, the refugees in the Public Works Department warehouse shelter, Fuzhou Road Market shelter, New World shelter, Xinxin Company shelter, and Qingliang Temple shelter, as well as the Salvation Army, have all benefited. Now the output of each dairy farm is gradually decreasing, and the number of drinkers is gradually increasing. Therefore, the total amount of free supply per day has been reduced to about 100 pounds. The Public Works Department hopes that this kind of supply will continue, so that refugees, especially infants with insufficient breast milk, will benefit greatly. The dairy farms in the safe area are now operating as usual, but the time for sending milk every morning has been slightly delayed due to the martial law in the concession. There is plenty of food and grass for the cows to eat. The difficulties that the manufacturers felt at the beginning of the war have been reduced. Milk prices have increased slightly compared to normal days (Grade A sterilized milk is 33 cents to 34 cents per pint, Grade A milk is 34 cents to 40 cents, and Grade B milk is 20 cents to 25 cents). Each dairy farm has been temporarily inspected by the Health Department, and the situation is very good. Milk drinkers can rest assured.</p>
