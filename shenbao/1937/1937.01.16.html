<p>時評</p>
<h3>戈林訪問羅馬</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>德國戈林將軍於前日到臨羅馬現正與意相墨沙里尼及外長齊亞諾在維民齋宮會晤。商談德意間的種種問題。我們記得。幾個月前。齊亞諾訪問柏林。由此而訂下德意協定。則此次戈林的訪問羅馬。將可能產生同樣重要的結果。對於這個具有重大國際作用的會晤。我們不能不加以十分的注意。</p>
<p>這次會晤中的主要人物戈林。是弟一值得注意的。他是普魯士邦的總理。是德國的秘密警察長。是衆院議長空軍部長又是新創立的所謂“四年計劃”的總裁。在這許多光榮的頭銜之外。不久以前。戈林將軍又曾以“大砲代牛油”的名言。引起全世界的注目。實在說。這位一身而兼五要職的人物。在德國內政外交上的力量。正不亞於希特勒總理。他的親自出馬。訪問羅馬。此之數月前齊亞諾的訪問柏林。當有更重大的影響。</p>
<p>這次羅馬會談的重要性。在最近歐洲局勢的發展上。也可以反映出來。最近歐局發展的最顯著趨向。為德國內部恐慌的日增嚴重與外交地位的益趨孤立化。數月前德國曾發生牛油恐慌。現在則已發展至小麥恐慌。這種恐慌的深刻化。若不在政治外交上設法補救。其前途的危機。將不堪設想。但在外交上。自從日德同盟和德意協定成立以來。德國的地位非但未見增強。反而更趨不利。最顯明的一點。素來隱然為德國撐腰的英國。感到日德同盟後對於英國在遠東利益的威協。以及德意協定成立後對於英國在歐洲地位的影響。已經轉變態度。一面與蘇聯增進親善。一面又與法國切實合作。上月底英意地中海協定的訂立。法國的從旁拉攏。是大有關係的。由於英意協定的訂立。本來德意對於西班牙的聯合干涉。忽然因了意國態度的漸趨淡漠。成為德國單獨盲撞之勢。於是德軍在摩洛哥的野心。立刻受到英國的堅决反對。而艾登外相甚至採取更尖刻的態度。批評戈林將軍“以大砲代牛油”的政策為不合時宜</p>
<p>在這種情勢之下。戈林將軍的訪問羅馬。他的使命是不輕的。他的第一步工作。當是根據原有的德意協定。更進一步促成兩者間更密切的勾結。他的第二步工作。則是通過意國的關係。使英國對德能重溫舊好。由此更進一步。以離間目前英國對法的密切合作。假使這種使命能够完全達到。則最近一二月來英法共同努力所造成的暫時平靜局面。將重起劇烈的變化。而成為侵略陣線的再度囂張。</p>
<p>我們從戈林的毅然出為親往羅馬看來。覺得他不會毫無所獲的。但在其他方面。我們也可以看到他必然要遇到的阻碍。第一。意國對英的妥協。現在是通過法國而成立的。一年以來。意國對法始終保持着相當良好的關係。德國現在要使法國孤立。第一。就不容易。第二。據說這次德意的談判中。將包括德國在意領多特干民斯島成立航空站的問題。這與意國或者沒有多大關係。但就英國在地中海的地位講。它是决不能容許德國勢力的插入的。這是主要的兩点。而德國對於南欧以至西班牙摩洛哥的野心。當然也不容忽視。究竟這位國社黨要人能從法西斯祖國帶點什麽東西回去。我們當拭目以觀數日內談判的結果。</p>

<p>次潘局長演講略謂義務教育之重要、各位業已担任了此種工作、想已經明暸其責任之重大、惟已往成績、據調查視察結果、不能使人滿意、其原因當然很多、希經過此次講習後、各位切磋討論之結果、將來能改正過去之缺點、茲提出數點意見貢獻各位、㊀辦短期小學的負責人要忠實所謂忠實卽是忠心努力於本職、認此工作是很重要的工作、眞心誠意去做、不怕任何勞苦卽是忠實、過去有一部份人不能忠必於本職、以此工作為隨便敷衍個人生活的職業、不甚認識其意義、如有人因學生招不到、乃有臨時拉湊、裝點人頭之欺騙現象、這就是不忠實、希望講習會後、各位能隨時提出討論、改變此現象、以後就要實事求是脚踏實地去做、㊁短期小學的教師要加倍努力、我們知道國家辦短期小學是萬不得已的辦法、要是國家有錢就應該使學齡兒童受六年、至少是四年的教育、但中國沒有錢、所以只能受一年的短期小學教育、一年時間很短、所得已經很少、但教師不努力、可以說一無所得了、所以各位要比普通小學的教師格外努力、負這樣大的責任、做如此艱難的工作、拚命努力、尤恐不逮、决不可以怠忽的、㊂教短期小學班學生不僅教他識字讀書、還要教他做人的道理、教育的意義原不是讀書識字而已、此僅是教育的一小部份、據新的說法教育是改變舊的不良的、而為新的良好的、中庸上說、“天命之謂性、率性之謂道、修道之謂教、”教是修道、修做人的道、道是率情、統制人性卽是道、而性是天賦的、每個人都要天賦的性能統率此性卽是道、把此道修明卽是教、故教育是用後天的方法去補救先天之性的缺點和不足、短期小學的學生、僅有這一年的受教育機會、故要在一年內教他做人、成為健全的國民、完全靠各位教師、要能以身作則教他做人的道理使他能讀書識字知道做人、這就是最好的成績、總之教育是精神的事業、各位多一分精神、卽多一分成績、要認眞努力去做、庶不負國家的期望云、</p>

<h3>本市各界努力統一救國運動</h3>
<p>聯合簽名發表宣言</p>
<p>近來本市各大學校長教授•中小學校長•教員著作家•新聞記者•及工商各界人士•鑒於前次兩廣及西安事變、均經中央用政治方式解决、我國統一之機運、顯已趨於成熟、惟陝甘善後、尚待中央籌劃處置、而共黨及失意政客、妄欲乘機利用封建殘餘勢力、希圖形成割據局面、殊違中國現階段之需要、僉謂我國經二十餘年之奮鬥、犧牲無量數生命財產、方造成統一局面、斷不容人假借任何口實、而破壞統一、必以全民力量擁護之、爰發起“統一救國運動、起草‘統一救救國宣言’、廣徵簽名、聞各地文化界亦正在簽名加入、茲探得其宣言原文如左、</p>
<p>統一救國宣言</p>
<p>一　一九三六年的危機算過去了、然敵人的野心未戢、世界戰機日迫、一九三七年無疑地不是“和平之年”、而我們當前的課題，却是“我們怎麽辦”、我們要堅决地抗敵禦侮、我們也要努力準備應付當前的世界大戰、要抗敵禦侮、要應付大戰、必須先達到軍令與政權的眞正統一、且戰事一旦發生、轉運之事有賴於交通的便利、餉械所資、有恃乎工業的發達、是又有待於全國經濟建設的迎頭趕上、而欲達經濟建設迎頭趕上的目的、則非政權絕對統一不為功、否則局部作戰徒與敵人各個擊破的良機建設落後、自必貽軍需匱乏的大戚、所以目前我們的救國工作、無論抗敵也好、建設也好、必以鞏固統一為第一步、</p>
<p>二　歷史告訴我們、不經過加富爾的統一運動、意大利沒有隆盛的可能、不經過俾士麥的中央集權運動、德意志不能得志於一八七○年的戰爭、不經過明治廢藩維新的運動日本不能一躍而入强國之林、不經過基瑪爾的國民革命運動、土耳其不能脫離英希的覆勒、而現階段的中國恰正如加富爾時代的意大利•俾士麥時代的德意志•明治維新期的日本•國民革命期的土耳其、卽就中國歷史來說、歷代當統完成之時、國運無不隆盛、到得分崩的現像發生、便入於衰亂狀態而趨於滅亡、所以中國的需要統一、在這危機急迫的時候實是顚撲不破的眞理、在這極迫切的需要之下、我們不能不認清一切“反統一”的勢力、</p>
<p>三　“反統一”的勢力有三、㊀封建的殘餘軍閥、㊁中國共產黨以及所謂“人民陣線”或“聯合戰線”㊂為敵人作虎倀的漢奸、如溥儀•殷汝耕•德王•李守信之徒、這三者原都在必須排擊之列、但我們仍殷切期待這些畜意反統一的人們、能隨歲序的更新、有切實的悔悟、把那種阻撓統一的企圖、移作擁護統一的行動、倘事實的演進、正符我們的期待、反統一的人們、果能翻然改圖、站到擁護統一的陣線、自是國家民族的大幸、萬一這些人竟是冥頑不靈之流、或習於割據、自召分崩、或甘為傀儡、認賊作父、或為虎作倀、賣國求榮、那我們就不得不出於始終排擊的一途、我們須知、目前的統一、雖僅是統一的雛形、但我們國家民族所付統一的代價、已極鉅大、倘付了這樣大的代價、還連雛形的統一、都不能保持、那我們已往三十年間的革命犧牲、豈不都成為無代價的犧牲、我們尤須知、我們的敵人、隨時隨地、在使用分化策略、實現他分裂中國宰割中國的夢想、使我們的國家、不能經統一而復興、因此、我們為着珍衛這雛形的統一、為着保育這雛形的統一、使他成長、决不容許殘餘軍閥與無恥政客的繼續割據、决不容許甘為傀儡及虎倀的共黨和漢奸的橫行、</p>
<p>四　尤可注意的是從前軍閥為了保持割據的局面、曾經主“聯省自治”、今日的共黨則於日暮途窮之際、也高唱“人民陣線、或聯合戰線”、“人民陣線”是什麽、煽動人民反抗政府、以破壞國家的秩序而已、“聯合戰線”是什麽、聯合一切封建殘餘勢力、以阻害國家統一而已、譬如最近共黨所煽成西安事變、便是共黨套着人民陣線”輿“聯合戰線”的外衣來打擊中國的統一的鐵證、共黨豈不知一國不容有兩政府、如果眞有救國的誠心、何不取銷“中國蘇維埃”、共黨又豈不知、軍權軍令的分歧、不足以對外作戰、如果眞有抗敵的熱忱、何不取銷“紅軍”、何况事實勝於雄辯、共黨的“中國蘇維埃、和“紅軍”、全在外人干涉中國內政魔手的操縱下、其實質和冀東的偽組織、犯綏的偽聯軍、毫無不同我們敢說、凡是干涉他國內政魔手所伸到的地方、都不是所在國的福祉、遠的事例、固多不勝舉、卽就最近來說、也就够我們寒心、譬如西班牙在所謂“人民陣線”政府的統治下、不是已成紅黑兩國際勢力的戰場麽、西班牙人民在這戰場中的所得、除却悲慘的死傷、不安的寢食、傾家蕩產的慘禍、還有什麽東西、我們果為什麽也要去作同樣的犧牲、</p>
<p>五　這是很明白的、中國今日非做到眞正的統一、不能打破割據地方的反動勢力、且以國際危機之日迫、尤需統一工作之加速度地完成、始能應付當前的難局、政治統一、固須有經濟的建設、為之基礎、乃克久長、况我國生產落後、交通未闢、却成為現代國家、亦正有待於建設事業之發展、但若國家無統一的政權、為之保障、則種種建設、殊未易進行、或竟反遭破壞、故政權的統一、在另一方面、實經濟建設的先决條件、不特抗敵禦侮，有賴統一而已、</p>
<p>由此可知在今日的中國、非統一無以堅抗敵的力量、也非統一無從收建設的成效、一句話、惟有完成統一、始能拯救中國、故於民國二十六年的到來、我們敢喊出“統一救國”的巨大呼聲、希望全國上下、無論任何職業、都能立即起來、致贊助、用整個民族的大力量、作全國輿論的總動員、於最短期間、糾正任何派別的歪曲意識、消滅任何地方的割據勢力、不問是軍閥·是漢奸·或是共黨·我們深刻地相信、惟有鞏固的統一、纔是救國的基石、我們願盡其全力、為整個的中華民族、完成這偉大“統一救國”運動、中華民國二十六年一月九日、</p>

<h3>歐亞兩洲大陸長在移動狀態之下</h3>
<p>徐家匯天文臺長昨對西報記者談話　謂地球之面渠已測量過二十分之一</p>
<p>字林報云、徐家滙天文臺臺長法國科學院會員科學博士萊諧Lejay神甫、離滬近兩年、在此時期內曾參加各種會議、並在歐洲與小亞細亞各地繼續其研究工作、已於數日前返滬、昨日（十四日）接見字林報訪員時、談及其重力測量工作、作驚人之宣布曰、“余已測量地球之面、一十分之一矣”、博士謂渠返歐洲、首先參加巴黎國際天文學大會、會中曾討論大陸移動問題、韋格納氏學說之所以為普通人士稱異者、因其言南美洲之東濱與菲洲之西濱似為一個更大大陸裂成之兩半而大陸皆在移動、例如美洲每年西移約米突、此項學說、欲予切實研究預計需時五十年之久、博士之學說提出時、科學界曾為之震動、渠乃根據精察徐家滙與歐洲各大文臺間所記星辰經過之前後時間、而斷以為歐亞兩洲大陸長在移動狀態中、故巴黎與上海兩地間之距離、每月常顯然相差三十米突、經度距離顯然的相差、乃就地球中心與涉及地點間所畫重直綫而測定、欲予釋明、有三主要學理為、㊀因氣象的擾動、對星的方向、當經過垂直面時、由於星光之偏斜、或非正確之方向、㊁地球內部之物體、影響自地球中心所畫之垂直綫、地球重心為此項物體移動所變易㊂因地殼之變動、兩城間之距離、實際常在移動中、徐家匯天文臺今仍在研究該問題、博士於一九三五年九月在華沙出席氣象學領袖會議、卽名“臺長會議者是此會之主要目的、為謀組織世界氣象中心點、俾各中心點對於航空學之發展、有所貢獻、是宜組織氣候之預測、並氣候狀况之報告、庶各大陸可相聯絡、此為航空旅行必要之因素、博士曰“吾人必須在航空學中佔前進之地位、美國與馬尼刺間航空綫之開通、使氣象學界感受甚大之印象並使組縱直接交通、畫一電碼與觀察時間、較前更形重要、”博士又述及重力測量事、謂渠準備先測量為上層之遠東之大部分法蘭西•叙利亞•與巴力斯坦之一部分、渠在叙利亞時、某夜突為土匪所襲、盡刦其所有之金錢、不意有英國警察一隊在黑暗中出現、乃將匪衆逐退、所幸匪衆並未觸及測量重力之儀器、渠已測量地球之面二十分之一、而就環境在每隔約五十至一百公里處設立重力測量處、有荷蘭著名科學家一人曾乘潛艇在海底作同樣研究、彼等希望在後五年至十年中藉其他從事此學之科學家之協助、測遍地球全部、此學可以解决關於地球之大小地球之內部組合地球之平衡之許多問題、博士於是乃取紙簿、並持一鉛筆、指示渠已發現地震之所在地、或卽為地震之原因、博士謂在地殼下若干距離、可稱為達平衡層之點、其地自上之壓力、幾同等焉、凡遇高山、則其一之壓力當然增大、其結果在此平衡層或一種陷凹而與相抵、此為常例、但平衡層遇堅岩之組織時、當然不能成此相抵之陷凹、於是此岩石組織在壓力不常有之處、因負重過甚、遂時時分裂、由此裂處發出之波浪、傳至地面乃成地震矣、</p>
<p>博士又嘗研究大氣中之臭氱量、兩年前徐家滙天文臺曾發見上海大氣中臭氱之量、遇反旋風時較大、遇低氣壓時較小、此與歐洲所發見者正相反、其故何在乎、而北極臭氱之量、或倍於赤道、博士之舉理、以為臭氱與反旋風同進、上海之臭氱來自西比利亞、而達赤道、歐洲則來自阿查爾斯羣島、博士之學理最初發表時、頗令科學家為之訝異蓋科學家久以為上層之大所乃不動的、臭氱之變動乃由當地太陽射光之變動所致、近畢高德氏與全國地理學會氣球家皆發覺有烈風吹於所謂同溫層、於是博士之學理、乃得左證、博士謂渠擬繼續研究此點、因為在同溫層所記其行動切實的度數能與在下層大氣中所記者相符合、則豫測下層大氣之行動、可更準確也、渠並將繼續研究空氣中吸收水氣之量、及圖解决查明大氣中養氣總量之難題、訪員於是請博士對日蝕問題略作數言、博士謂下次中國之日蝕、乃在一九四一年福州可見其全蝕、屆時世界各國著名天文學家將結大隊連袂來華、觀察其現象、渠將會同彼等工作、以求此項學理、</p>

<p>粉麥慘跌　實銷停頓多頭心慌　澳麥最後估計發表</p>
<p>粉市、乃以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌二四五角不等、欠拿大跌三四角左右、當開價後、以洋麥連疲、國內之實銷、或以價高、或以販裝不便、本月份因距交割日近、業外多頭勢非了結不可、是以開價、步步不振、較前日均跌二三分、迫至下午開盤、市面又復慘跌、以業外多頭、鑒於實銷不活、不能再擯、對本月份及二月份、均有暢脫、而其他客戶、則因結賬之故、吸收無力三四月份亦因近期之故、帶落亦銳、最後結局、均較跌六七八分不等、照目下情形、因多頭無實銷之襯托、自難發揮其勢力、所以後步情形、尚有被迫下降之勢、至今日交易、因鬆跌之故、計達八九二萬包云、</p>
<p>麥市停寂之中、終帶軟勢、下午亦見暴降、當開價時、一二月份均見空拍、一無做開、三月份雖有做開、出入毫無、四六月份、則人心軟虛、較小三四分、迫至下午開盤、市氣突告不穩、因粉市大變多頭不支、因此麥市人心、亦為之暗淡無神、多頭亦見暢出、跌度亦達一角左右、此種市面、較本年之初價、本月份計跌二角九分、二月份跌三角六分、三月份跌三角九分、四月份跌四角一分、可見過漲之後、反動亦殊可觀也、現麥市面依然停寂、市上祇有零星交易、迄少大批脫手、廠家祇應酬幾百包、價較小三五分云、</p>
<p>路透十四日紐約電、芝加哥麥市因外國市軟、浮多了結、跌八七五至一分二七五、</p>
<p>又同日倫敦電、澳麥之最後官方佔計、與種植面積、發表如左、</p>
<p>客秈旺到銷路亦暢</p>
<p>昨日客秈到源仍旺、前昨兩天中新到又達三四萬包、存積逐增、人心多為虛軟市面本有趨平之象、惟昨日客化轉活、汕頭帮辦胃又濃、成交三千包左右粵帮亦有機米等應酬二千包左右、本街又活、且有囤戶問津因此交易轉旺、市面亦得站住、全日開出贛米六千多包、湘米一千二百包漢糙四百十七包、溫秈二千包、小絞一千包、</p>
<p>河米行市無甚上落</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源、共到六十餘號、貨約萬二千七八百石、內中薄稻一十餘號、本街銷塲因小月底已過、略有動辦、包子胃口亦有天津靑島煙台等帮辦薄稻近三千包、所以行情雖屬定局、然形勢已呈堅挺之象厚薄粳無所榮辱杜洋尖及陰變元亦無軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源四十五六號、市上各貸銷塲、依然平常、白粳堆戶取巧者略有交易、市况平定、心思求脫者、價鬆數分、薄稻頂貨平定、中次又見疲勢、早稻平疲、白元軟弱、各秈及其餘各貨、無甚上落、</p>
<p>大宗糧食運往南粵</p>
<p>三品慘跌十二三元金雞二月獨漲元許近漲遠跌又見倒掛今歲內地豐收、故長江來滬之糧食擁擠、而南北帮銷路亦甚佳、北洋方面、近三月中由滬運去麵粉一項、不下百餘萬包、米豆亦在六十餘萬包之譜、近兩星期稍見呆滯出口漸少、聞因北方價格較滬為遜、又因棧房儲滿、日來汕粵帮進胃活躍、前日海利廣州兩輪、運粵計米豆約有一萬八千餘包、令日出口之海員•大利南•廣東三輪、計運汕麵粉一萬七千包、米豆一萬六千餘包、運粵麵粉一萬一千五百包、米豆二萬一千四百餘包、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>近期紗與三品背馳　三品慘跌十二三元　金雞二月獨漲元　許近漲遠跌又見倒掛</p>
<p>紗市晨漲十回、但近期市態異常堅挺、市傳有多頭公司組織、購進二月期、準備收貨、又說印商喬直夫買進尤夥、查某號獨買二月期為額甚鉅套出三•四月期、亦屬不少、故三品紗市雖頻頻下墮、近月未受影響、遠期轉趨鬆懈、現紗交易殊覺沉悶也、三品紗比上日慘落八元二角至十三元四角、</p>
<p>二月期有大買戶</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月得見下跌、因連朝狂騰之三品紗、業巳反動、步步下控、同業傾向拋賣、然市塲未受重大影響、市價反趨上升、檯面尚緊、實因綿昌賡豐兩戶在二月期大景吸進、放出三•四月期、市傳買進巳有一•二萬包之說、然遠期套出亦鉅、現紗交易依然沉寂、標紗結果近月漲一元四•六角、遠月漲跌一•三角、午後開盤以三品紗步步下瀉、人心稍受牽制、同時現紗生意凋敵、浮多了結、市盤又遭挫抑、結果各月比上午收盤價跌五•七•八角至一元、查賣出恒益六百包、錦昌一千三百五十包、泰興一千一百五十包、賡豐二千二百包、森康一千○五十包、仁豐八百包、長豐三千三百包、合興一千包、永大五百包、同和五百包、買進裕大九百五十包、明德七百包、愼記九百包、大昌成三千三百包、潤康一千一百五十包、協成八百包、信誠五百包、昶記六百五十包、興昌六百五十包、聚興四百包、益昶四百包、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>綫價獨漲一元</p>
<p>現紗銷塲平庸、查全日各帮買夫統計五百七十六包、售價平平、綫漲一元、各帮買額列下、</p>
<p>棉花起伏不巨　市塲交易亦清</p>
<p>棉市無榮無辱仍屬不脫盤旋之局、形勢憊疲不振、加之海外印美棉市亦事徘徊之勢、人心更無興趣、但紗花比例相差太遠、有一部份拉緊、亦不放棄也、</p>
<p>標花祇跌一角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、趨勢異常平凡、市海外棉市奄無生氣、市塲交易愈形稀薄、故絕無精彩可言、但有一部份因各路產區之價難鬆、而看好、結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一角至一角半、午後開盤三品花遠期狂瀉、市况又遭打擊、近期跌破四元至五元關口、但塲中交易甚清、上落不大結果各月比上午收盤均跌一角至二角半、查賈出長豐三千擔、振大八百擔、通記九百擔、大昌成一千二百擔、泰昌一千六百擔、同和九百擔、新昶一千二百擔、瑞源一千二百擔、源興昌八百擔、泰興一千六百擔、買進吉豐一千一百擔、恒益二千六百擔、裕大三千擔、振大八百擔、合興九百擔、益昶一千三百擔、長和一千七百擔、望泰興一千擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉廠需不斷</p>
<p>現棉消費尚稱不薄、廠需不斷、來源到姚花二千十八包、通花一千三百六十包、</p>
<p>美棉仍處於　政府脫售存棉恐怖下</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月跌四磅音至漲二磅音、晨初外商買進、利物浦消息良好、國內消費增大、惜多頭了結、尤以三月為最、同時三月期多頭亦有掉期至遠月、月下棉市仍處政府脫售存棉所引起恐慌之勢力下、新買甚少同行雖為好買主、然其對三月期之需要，不若以前殷切正月期交割通知單、發表一紙、收盤堅穩、計現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌五磅音至漲二磅音、英棉現貨跌一點、期貨漲一二點、印棉投機家賣出及多頭了結、惟本地廠家因布疋堅昂、大批吸收、計平果爾跌○•二五至○•七五羅比、奧姆辣跌一至一•二五羅比、白羅溪跌一羅比、原電錄左、（十四日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、十五日開盤預測、白羅溪為二百二十九羅比半、奧姆辣為二百○六羅比半、均跌○•七五羅比、平果爾為一百八十三羅比七五、跌半羅比、</p>
<p>附美棉週末統計報告如下（單位千數）</p>

<h3>五金</h3>
<p>馬口鐵中外同昂</p>
<p>馬口鐵第年銷塲達二十萬箱、本街廠家用度較多、客帮較少、來源推美國最多意•德•法•英次之、物質亦以美、為最佳、英法貨為最次、近市上流通已以美意為最多、德英較少、至於法貨業已斷檔、再將各貨市况誌後、</p>
<p>（美貨）最近市上所流通者、有九十磅單連（十四寸二十寸）、雙連（二十寸二十八寸）、及一百磅單連雙連、交易因貨價奇高、實銷甚少、而定價飛漲、如雙連九十磅開十金元、一百磅十一金元一角、（單連價减半）聞同業做進遠期貨達四千箱、而本街昨槪做出百餘箱、</p>
<p>（意貨）此貨物質良佳、故實交殊熱鬧、市上流通貨祇一百八十磅一種、行情開四十一元、比前好一元、海外定價最近為四十二先令、（九十磅雙連）而一百磅雙連開四十三先令、聞同業定進達四千餘箱、聞由北蘇州路及新開河一帶五金號定進、</p>
<p>（德貨）市上所流行者亦祇九十磅雙連一種、一百磅雙連祇有少許現貨、故無大市、其價九十磅雙連開四十元零五角、一百磅開四十三元、聞交易較意貨略為清淡、而定價則與意貨相彷同業購定者殊少、</p>
<p>（英貨）在上前四五年中、其貨交易執馬口鐵市塲中之牛耳、其後因物質較次、被意德貨淘汰、因到貨亦見减少市上流通者祇九十磅及一百磅單連二種而已、至於雙連久無裝到、其價九十磅開十元零五角、一百磅二十二元、聞客帮生意尚有、而本街賀賣殊無所聞、至海外定價、九十磅二十先令、一百磅二十一先令、亦比前硬起一先令云、</p>

<h3>家庭教育的展望</h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>家庭教育，是一切兒童教育的基礎；因為不拘社會教育，學校教育，都須先經過了家庭教青那個階段，纔能够啣接的。所以有人說：家庭是社會的盤石，社會的本位便是由家庭的份子組織而成的，然而婦女却是家庭中的中心人物，這如果將家庭比喻一個學校的話，那末，婦女就是學校裏的教職員，孩子應該是學生了。</p>
<p>我們如果研究過兒童心理的話，相信總能够明白，兒童在未達學齡的期間——孔歲以前，是一個最重要的學習時期；因為每一個兒童從初生下來，根本就沒有什麽智能，只是些純潔的求智心。所以，當在這一個時期裏，兒童最當於學習和模仿的能力，那在我們平常看到兒童們在二三歲以內，便能够牙牙地學講一些普通的語言，就是很好的證明。因此兒童們在這一個時期中，最容易學會各種習慣，和各種基本觀念。</p>
<p>兒童在入學前期中，旣無機會接觸學校教育，自然更談不到受社會教育，所以這時候該是家庭單獨負責教育的一個重要時期。並且家庭教育乃人生全部訓練的出發點，不論關於體格，心情，行為，德性，智能，習慣之養成，端賴於良根子家庭教育。卽使兒童已達入學年齡，在教育上雖然已有學校負責，可是他們還有更多的時間仍是在家庭裏消磨過去的，譬如飲食起居等日常生活，他們還是要在自己的父母身邊過着。因為這樣，孩子卽使已經入學，但家庭教育的重要地位依然是照樣的存在；况且，學校教育根本原是機械化的，决不會像家庭教育那樣地活潑，那樣地使孩子們得到深刻的體騐。</p>
<p>去年，我曾經去訪問了好多個慈幼團體；也曾去參觀過好多個留養機關，它們給予我們印像都非常良好；因為它們雖然是一個團體或機關，但對於兒童們除學校教育外，家庭教育也十分重視，不拘禮貌，人格，行為，習慣，勞働，思想的訓導，身必健康，智能常識的修養，都比了家庭裏好得多。那也沒有別的關係，不過因為他們那些教員保姆自己的智識充裕，並且又肯盡職，不像一般母親的溺愛，也不會凌虐；他們對於那些善良的孩子給予獎勵，頑劣的却給以反省的處分，所以這些被人們所遺忘的無家流浪兒童，全成了刻苦精誠的好孩子。由於那印象的啟示，我便想起怎樣纔能够合於談家庭教育的條件呢？第一，我們對於自己的身心應該有充分的修養。第二，澈底的拋棄宗法傳統習慣的觀念。第三，要使兒童養成良好的習慣與品性。第四，應研究兒童教育的必需知能常識。第五，為父母者對於自己的兒童應該公允正確。第六，勿在兒童面前有淫穢或迷信的行為……總之，我們隨時隨地都不能讓兒童的腦筋裏受到一點不良的印像，和染上一點不良的習慣。</p>
<p>“昔孟母，擇鄰處，”伊也是恐怕自己的孩子，受了鄰舍壞孩子的影響，所以伊必須擇鄰而處，近朱者赤，近墨者黑，兒童們的性情是最容易被同化的。</p>
<h3>今後的婦女</h3>
<p>— 朱秀清</p>
<p>民國二十六年來了，無論那一種人在開始第一日是興高采烈的儘情快樂一天，可是無論那一種人（當然神經麻木的人不在內”的內心裏却不期然的印上一個可怕的黑影。大家知道：“復興”這條路是不容易走的，有很多崎嶇和障碍阻住我們，於是，我們不得不放上全部力量奮鬥，奮鬥。雖然，强敵比我們堅强得多，但假使我們憑了我們的熱血努力掙扎，終有一天會克服强敵的。大家心上旣深深的印上了黑影，希望別為了黑影而心寒，而胆怯，而氣餒，應努力地移去這黑影。</p>
<p>婦女們在今天自然是很忙的，但我希望婦女們不要今天在百忙之中忘掉了今天應該負起的今年的一個責任。這責任是歷來婦女所忽視的，無論如何，請婦女們從今天起切切實實負起這重大的責任來！</p>
<p>誰都明白，孩子是沒有一個教不好的，然而孩子的能不能教成好孩子，却是婦女最大的責任。孩子是一張雪白一些塵埃不染的白紙，而為母親的是執着筆桿的作畫者；這張圖畫的好壞，完全鑿於作畫者的下筆如何而定。所以丟開孩子不關心的婦女，是為母親的罪惡。國家不健全，是缺乏健全的靑年。而靑年不健全，是由於缺乏健全的兒童。但兒童的所以不健全，是為母親的罪過，從這樣說來國家的不振興，該是婦女的罪過。况且，中國以嬌弱之軀，踏上險巇的道上，不用說，極端需要堅强的靑年。那末，換句話說，也就是極端需要堅强的兒童。</p>
<p>要養成堅强的兒童，應從三方面同時並進。一：對於日常知識，科學知識，以及國家大勢等，為母親的須使孩子一一領會。二：為母親的務使孩子養成勤苦耐勞，不怕媽難，不惜犧牲的毅力，以及大無畏的精神。三：中國人是東方病夫：所以最要緊是使孩子沒有不康健的體格，為母親的最好使孩子成為一隻小蠻牛才行。</p>
<p>時間是飛越得最快的一瞬眼一年又會逃跑了。趕快！婦女們請於今天决心負起這復興民族的關鍵的責任吧！</p>
<h3>日本女子和白粉</h3>
<p>— 一髪</p>
<p>在我國內地所看見的日本女子，臉上都塗得像曹操般的白。到了日本之後，才知道日本女子拍粉，已成了習慣。四五十歲的婦人，還是滿臉都是胭脂和百粉。日本女子拍粉的方法也是特異的，不論天氣怎樣冷，都是把上身裸了，跪在鏡子面前，拍個爽快。頭頸裏的白粉，堆砌得連皮膚紋路都埋沒了，和臉上成了一條很顯明的界綫。這樣可以用化裝的方法，造成一個鵝蛋臉。西京是出美人的地方，娘兒們沒有一個不濃裝艷抹的。東京女子，已有喜穿洋裝的傾向，於是白粉的使用法，亦起了變更。大都以各色脂胭調和着塗抹，但是總比我國女子的化裝為濃艷妖麗。</p>
<p>女學生在中學裏是穿着靑色的制服，並不拍粉的。到了高等女學之後，便要開始梳髪化裝。在清晨街上，許多脂粉滿面的女子，花枝招展的走着，她若不挾着書包，有誰相信伊們是到學校裏去讀書呢。有電車裏，在冷僻的小巷裏，常發生假紳士和不良少年調戲女學生的事件，這不能不歸罪於日本女學生太喜歡裝飾的緣故。</p>
<p>以前日本的白粉，都含有鉛毒，優伶藝妓等，拍粉過多的，時常中毒，不治至死。至昭和四年（民國十八年）政府命令禁止發售含有鉛質的白粉。但是沒有鉛質的白粉，不但效果不佳，並且容易脫落。好容易後來御園和蝴蝶園，都出了些新質的白粉，才阻止了外國貨的輸入。現在逐漸改良，雖名為白粉，而分作七八種顏色。女子們可以挑選着以調和服裝季節以及各自的個性。我國婦女雖然沒有日本女子的消費白粉，但是其他香水脂粉，都比日本女子耗費。况且日本女子們所用的裝飾品，全是國貨。他們不但能供給本國婦女使用，還可以輸入我國。而我國女子却摒棄了國產的化裝品，以購用外國貨為榮，那是根本和日本女子不同，是十分可恥的。</p>
<p>百貨公司裏發售化裝品的，盡是年輕美貌的女職員。伊們用着最上等的脂粉，做化裝的模特兒。有時還勸誘着顧客，試騐各種化妝的方法，以推行伊的白粉。以前是以女優藝妓為廣告的，現在時代不同，出了很大的代價，請電影明星，歌舞明星，寫一封讚美信，以為廣告，情形和我國相同。從前明治維新的初期，良家婦女，以不施鉛華的多。白粉可說是女優藝妓的專用品，想不到現在如此普遍流行的。近幾年來，日本民生富裕，男女均受歐風薰陶，崇尚者侈。化妝方法，雖逐漸改變，而白粉總是日本女子所酷愛的。</p>
<h3>西班牙戰爭中的女傑（上）</h3>
<p>— 伯懇</p>
<p>誰說婦女是不配上戰塲的！在古今中外戰爭史上，我們固然看到過不少關於女子從軍的轟轟烈烈的事蹟，卽在最近關於西班牙內戰的記錄中我們也發見了四位新型的女武士，足以證明現代婦女貢獻於戰爭的能力並不亞於男子。</p>
<p>在西班牙現代女武士中，西蕃蓮女士LaPasionaria顯得時別勇猛。西蕃蓮是一個渾名；地的原名叫做杜洛斯·伊抱路利Dolores　Ibaruri。她是礦工之妻，曾做過洗衣婦。二年前，西班牙北部發生叛變，主要的參加者是奧維陀（Oviedo）地方的礦工；他們掀動革命，組織地方蘇維埃，但終因敵不過政府軍隊的歷制（那時西班牙政府買僱大隊的以勇猛著稱的摩爾傭兵）而潰敗。就在那一次戰役中，杜洛斯女士開始獻出女武士的身手，而且被人稱為西蕃蓮。</p>
<p>凡是住在奧維陀地方的，都熟知杜洛斯女士初次臨陣的事蹟。當時，熱中於布爾什維克主義而參加戰爭的一班礦工都以兵器不良為苦。他們隨身携帶的啥時一技老朽的短槍或連發手槍。他們覺得這些不中用的兵器對於他們的危險實有甚於政府軍隊的來臨。不久，他們發見他們日常在黑暗的礦層中所用的器械—炸藥棍—確實是一種最適用的軍器。於是炸藥棍就成為他們的手溜彈。</p>
<p>當時政府軍隊在奧維陀的大街及方塲布防。這里或那里，一個並不突兀的頭戴陳舊污穢的麻布披肩的成年婦人走過來，從摺縐的衣裾下面拿出一枚小小的東西，向兵士們猛力拋擲。這樣，她炸死了不少政府軍隊的兵士。這婦人原來就是被稱為西蕃蓮的杜洛斯女士。</p>
<p>就外貌說，“西蕃蓮”實在是一個最不相稱的渾名。杜洛斯·伊抱路利女士旣不年輕，也不像花朶一般嬌艷。她今年已五十七歲了，面貌也因久歷風塵而變得蒼老憔悴。和日常奔走於西班牙街市的無數勞工婦女相比，杜洛期女士委實不具任何特異的外貌。</p>
<p>她的丈夫是做過由礦工們創設的蘇維埃政府的委員的。在戰役中他被殺死，她也被捕入獄。數月後，她被赦出獄，又被選為國會中的共黨議員。</p>
<p>最近，西班牙內戰發動後，杜洛斯女士重父獲得參加戰爭的機會。這一次，她是站在政府軍方面的。她率領奧維陀地方的礦工們的妻孥組成一婦女敢死隊—這在西班牙還是創舉啦。</p>
<p>維多利亞·甘脫女士（Victoria　Kent）是西班牙女武士的另一典型。她是西班牙女性中的優秀分子。她不是共產主義者，却是一個改造派的共和黨員。她信仰改革，却不贊成推翻現秩序的改革。她誕生在西班牙，父親是英國人，母親是西班牙人；她曾留學英法二國。她是西班牙最初的女子參政權運動領袖之一，曾被衛兵從國王阿爾方沙（Alfonso）的皇宮門口拖到外面。不久，帝政崩潰，阿爾方沙被逐，共和政府成立，維多利亞女士輩所要求的婦女參政權從此奠定了基礎。維多利亞女士被選為國會讓員，且被任為典獄委員。</p>
<h3>當你的子女放學回家後你應同他談些什麽？</h3>
<p>— 楊戴中新</p>
<p>這一定是很快樂的，當你站在門口望見你的子女背着書包在嘻嘻哈哈地回來。及至他們到了你的懷中，你定然要問長問短，什麽今天有沒有被先生責問？有沒有被人欺侮？上操時跌過沒有？肚子餓不餓？有時或者要問今天算術懂不懂等問題；這些都十足表示着你慈愛的心腸會流露出你內心的喜悅！不過，這許多問題極少教育上的價值，如果不幸而他們能抓住並利用你那溺愛的缺點，那或將有害了。</p>
<p>我們應該知道教育卽生活，學校是改造生活的塲所；你的子女在學校中不斷地改造生活和經騐，他每天總要把生活改進一些。為母親的第一該知道他在這一天中有沒有獲得新的生活和新的經騐！所以在年幼的兒童，你可以問：你今天有沒有做過新的遊戲？怎樣做法？那些是有趣的故事？你能講不能講？至於年長一些的孩子，可以呌他報告一些集會運動自治工作等情形，其次可以問一些開於各科學習的情形和社會上的見聞，因為這些都是直接或間接有關兒童生活的。</p>
<p>同時，我們還應知道，學校和家庭，應絕對的聯絡，庶使教育效果增高，所以我們第二件要問孩子的是：先生有沒有話呌你告訴我們？這樣－來，他不致把先生急於要請家長合作的事忘掉。</p>
<p>再次，我們要問他今天有什麽家庭作業？或其他教師指定的預習工作？然後你給他支配一個工作時間，以便指導他按時工作，免他因不及做或忘却而受心理上的苦痛，這樣才足表示你眞正的慈愛！</p>
<p>最後，為母親的該知道你子女的社交生活，他們自四歲起就開始過他生活社交期的，這社交影響他極大，你自該詳細地詢問他和他的好朋友所過的生活？有沒有結交新的同伴？放了學要不要去訪問他？同時你應隨時指示他去結交優秀的朋友，避免不正常的工作，使他永遠處在優美的環境中。</p>
<h3>目光遠大</h3>
<h3>廣州的女挑夫</h3>
<p>— 錫</p>
<p>廣州，其商業上的發展，繁華。一切也和其他的大商埠一樣。是佔着中國第三位的重要商埠，但，那兒却有着數千名的女挑夫。當從廣州的輸埠，或是車站下來的時候。總可以見到伊們：一些年靑而强健的婦女，穿着靑布或香雲紗的短掛，赤着脚，像男子苦力一樣地在兜着旅客們，代搬一些笨重的行李，藉着得到些兒低微代價的酒錢，來維持伊們自己的生活。</p>
<p>婦女做挑夫，在過去，廣州是沒有的，它的產生，就不能不去歸罪於當年的軍閥，民國七八年的時候。在廣州的軍閥們，一遇到了什麽事情，便實行拉夫，所拉的，大都擇體壯者。因之，那些苦力們便成了他們心目中的合條件者，以致那些苦力們便避着不敢出來，在這種情况之下，於是女挑夫便應之而產生了。</p>
<p>一直到現在，婦女的挑夫，在廣州依然是一天天的繼續加增着，因為一般的旅客，都認為婦女在比較上要可靠得多，行李以及其他一切的東西，交給伊們挑一，可不致有被騙或敲詐的危險，並且挑價又比了男挑夫便宜三分之一，所以，伊們便很為一部份的人所需要着。</p>
<p>女挑夫中的一部份，是被雇於一些大堆棧的，伊們的工作，便更可憐了，除掉扛運一簍簍的果類或箱茶外，有時也得搬起笨重的鐵件跟米袋來，伊們所得的工資，大都是依搬運的件數來計算的，普通每件自輪埠扛至棧房，大概可得二分錢，但，伊們的工頭却還得抽去一些</p>
<p>那些女挑夫，大都是為了工廠裏找不得工做，在自己家裏有沒有織不機，更沒有地方可以去帮傭。為着本能的活命，才流落到碼頭上和車站去當挑夫，可是，伊們很多是巳有了孩子的，為着丈夫的不能維持，才不得已的棄下了孩子出來，以血汗去換一些錢來活命。</p>
<p>至於伊們的工作，每天至少須在十小時以上，但，所得的工資，却不會過八毛錢的，有時侯；不管冬季，是下雪天，如果輪船有半夜靠碼頭的，伊們也得起身去挑東西。</p>
<p>在許多做工的婦人中，廣州的女挑夫該算得是最辛苦的了。</p>
<h3>第一信</h3>
<p>— 卓呆</p>
<p>B女士：</p>
<p>今天從周先生處轉來一信，我已經讀到。女士的責備我，很不錯。當此祖國到了大難臨頭的日子，不去研究些可以救國利民的學術，去學那種造花園，不是預備供有閑階級享樂？無怪女士特地要託周先生轉一封信給我，說我不應該這麽老糊塗，把有限的光陰，去荒廢在無理取鬧上。這或者也是其地曉得我的人，所想對我說的話罷？</p>
<p>不過女士要曉得：我是一個很平凡的人，學習學劍，沒都成功，所以更談不到研究什麽救國利民的學術，還是把我從前種過七八年蔬菜的經騐，打算更進一步，去學些造園藝術。（還有許多人，都以為我學習園藝，這完全是誤會。）</p>
<p>我當初的志願，不過如此。豈料一進學校，細細把造園之道一研究，竟發見有意想不到的奇事，包含在造園學術之中，什麽西呢？就是女土所謂救國利民。想不到造園一道，也是救國利民的一種利器。女士聽了，不將笑我與跳舞救國一般的高呼造園救國麽？我說此話，並非滑稽談，完全是事實。現在且把造園的大槪，分別給你談一談。</p>
<p>我研究的造園，也有好幾種。最大的，大到面積數十里的天然公園，最小的，小到裝在一隻長方盤內的所謂盆景，都在這造園範圍之內。</p>
<p>普通的人，只曉得園有兩種，一種是私人的庭園，一種是公園。其實，分類沒有這麽簡單。凡是公共建築物，如官署學校病院圖書館公會堂等等，把餘地通路等處，用花木岩石等點綴，也是屬於造園的。</p>
<p>此外，還有那些風景區域，由政府劃作所謂天然公園，把它整理經營，也是造園的工作。我所說的救國利民，就是指這種天然公園而言。其他如都市公園以及私人庭園等，也與救國利民，很多關係，不過沒有天然公園那麽顯著。</p>
<p>近來各國往往都利用着自己國內山明水秀之區，定為國立天然公園，竭力宣傳，於是便成為名勝之區，以致遊人如織，因此這一個區域內，每年可以吸收外面無數的金錢。這一區域，便成為富裕之地。我們只消看了每年春秋二季，西子湖上，可以吸牧外間多少金錢，就能够明白這意思了。</p>
<p>不過現在各國的所謂國立天然公園，目的不僅在吸收國內的遊客，都是對外作盛大的宣傳，如北美的拿耶茄拉瀑布，那邊每年吸收旅客而得到的經濟利益，有四千萬，其中一半是外國人。</p>
<p>能够吸收外國人的金錢，我覺得實在是被列强經濟侵略的我中國今日一個最大的救國利民工作。而且辦天然公園，需要經費並不多，又是極適合於我國現在情形的女士！我將來，打算從天然公園入手，去踏入救國利民的第一步，大槪女士也贊成罷？</p>
<h3>一頁不可告人的日記</h3>
<p>— 秦晨</p>
<p>挺厚的一本日記簿，記了一年，論字數至少總有六七十萬了，但多半只是晴，天雨，吃飯，生病，來幾個朋友，用幾個錢………盡是些不相干的瑣事，別說守秘密，便是離開在圖書館裏，也不見得有人要看：自己在新年頭上翻翻，眞覺得太沉悶了，從頭至尾，似乎只有一頁最精采－些，這頁在當初原是不可告人的。如今却也到處去得了。</p>
<p>“………下午太陽是格外的神氣了，曬得每一張椅子都像害了，寒熱病一樣，燒得燙手，可是妻從朋友家裏來了兩次電話，堅持着要我在公畢後，灣過去吃夜飯，沒奈何就冒着暑熱，搭上了五路電車。五路電車是照例頂擠的，到××路，上來了一位女士，我少不得站起來讓座，不料那位女士不曾坐下，另一位男士的屁股已搶着挨過來了，一時不該太熱心，用手攔了他一攔，結果，那女士是坐下了，而我的瘦削的肩頭上却已挨了狠狠的一拳，他並且還用着許多極下流的話來罵我，我當然就想抵抗，但旁邊有許多人早擁上來勸住了，我的憤怒無從發洩，心上一氣悶便在第一個停車站下了車，低着頭毫無知覺地在太陽下走着。當時彷彿就學得有一對明亮的眸子在射到我臉上來，却也懶得注意。走了一段，突然在第二個停車站上發現了那個經我讓座的女士，不待我有猜想伊為什麽在這裏下車的時間，伊己開始向我道歉了，希望我不要為着一個下流人而生氣，並且還竭力邀我上一家飲冰室去喝冰淇淋。伊的態度是非常的誠懇，說話富於同情心，舉止又是怪伶俐動人的，使我實在不忍錯過這一個難得的機會；因就一起走進了飲冰室，通了尊姓，極投機地談上了一個多鐘頭，什麽多談到，只沒有說起我的家，伊也彷彿極感興趣地聽着，不時還發生怪可愛的會意的微笑來。最後我就在用以代替手中的皺紙上寫了我的辦公處所，電話號碼，以及我的全部的名姓，正想授給伊，希望預留一個後會有期的餘地；不料伊的臉色突然起了一種莫明其妙的變化，忽忽把這紙揉做一團，塞在手錢袋裏，起來搶着付了帳，便说另有要事，很慌張地坐着黃包車走了</p>
<p>待我找到妻的朋友家裏，他們已忍不住質問我為什麽這時候才下公事房；說一個謊原不是難事，便輕輕瞞過了。後來忽然給我在壁上發現了一張小照，這張小照眞使我嚇了一大跳，原來是妻和伊的朋友以及另外一位女士的同影，而這另外位女士却正是方才和我在飲冰室裏分手的那一位。我忙問妻：“這是誰”？</p>
<p>“咦！你不知道嗎？伊就是惠馨（妻的朋友）的妹妹啊！你瞧長得多好看！妻很得意地說。我眞不知道怎樣回答伊了”</p>

<h3>西安事變與電信</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>西安事變，已漸底定，蔣委員長亦已安然脫險，但痛定思痛，回憶當時情形，初則民衆惶惑，險象環生，後則萬衆鼓舞，興高彩烈，凡茲事態之變化，厥賴消息之互傳，而電信由阻斷迄於恢復，亦與此次事變相終始。</p>
<p>在蔣委員長蒙難期間，西安電信，首告不通，於是民衆呼號，奔走詢問，日往各報局中，探聽電路之通阻者，絡繹不絕，而各處援助營救之電亦紛至沓來，幾不暇接，其他在電話中互問西安情形者，更所在皆是。迨上月二十五日脫險，不數分鐘，卽由京陝長途電話，報告京中，瞬息之間，消息遍達，一時全國騰歡，莫不額手稱慶，街頭巷尾，祇聞爆竹聲喧，另換一種氣象，我國民衆，擁護領袖之熱烈，於此次西安事變，有充分之表現。</p>
<p>電路旣阻，電信不通，民情卽惶惑不寗，如大難之將至，綫路恢復，電信照常，民情卽轉趨樂觀，如風雲之開展。綫路為全國之神經，發佈命令，傳達意志，莫不賴神經之息息相通。自蔣委員長蒙難，而神經失常，民衆覺神經之失常也，則皇皇然露戚容，及蔣委員長脫險，神經卽完全恢復，民衆覺神經之恢復也，則欣欣然有喜色，神經之健康與否，國之安危繫焉，我人擁護領袖，愛護國家，同時自亦注重乎神經之安全。</p>
<p>我國電信交通，近年來𥀨顯猛烈之進展，西安事變，其詳情賴乎報話之傳遞者，異常迅捷，綫路破壞者，修復亦至速，故能於極短時間中，得通信上之重大便利。斯知發展電信，關係國利民生者至重。電信旣為全國神經系統，則保持神經之健全，厥為我人之職責，至增加建設，以達到其充分發育，更攸賴全國上下督促進行也。</p>

<p>按照電信條例，我國電信應由交通部統一辦理，若有特殊情形，經交通部核准後，也可由地方政府公私團體或個人設置。但事實上除了上項兩種情形外，各處未經交通部核准而設置之電信事業，亦不少。交通部為行使職權起見，自應加以監督。半年來之電信管理工作，大抵注重於此！舉其重要之設施如下：㊀進行調整各省辦長途電話，㊁統制播音節目，㊂監督民營市內電話，㊃統制公社團體自設專用電台㊄統一裝設專綫電話核准權等等。至部辦電信局所，過去半年中增加者，計有綫電報局四十處，（包括營業處代辦處在內）無綫電台一處，長途電話二十八處，都是在便利通信和發展業務上着想。</p>
<p>乙，電信工務</p>
<p>電信事業，在我國旣屬需要擴充，則一切進行，工務為重，從民國二十一年起，就綫路方面的展設而言，每年在一萬公里左右。其中屬於長途電話者，尤有空飛猛晋之象！過去半年來之電信工務，仍是繼前啟後的工作，茲將其設施情形報告如下：</p>
<p>（一）有綫電報綫路：計設綫一二三五公里，修綫二二六五公里，加綫二七五四公里。</p>
<p>（二）有綫電報機械：計㊀漢長雙工綫，於漢口局添裝克利特收報複鑿</p>
<p>機一部，㊁滬漢雙工綫，於滬，蘇，潯蕪漢四局，加裝振動器各一部，㊂懷寗，畢節，汕頭，贛縣，江山等五局，添裝韋氏單工帮電機各一部，㊃鄭縣裝蓄電池一部，㊄上饒，巴東各添裝莫氏機一部，㊅漢口至沙市，信陽，老河口三電路，均改裝莫氏雙工機一部，㊆蘇魯兩區及鄰近各局處改裝音嚮機八十部。</p>
<p>（三）無線電報機械：計㊀京，漢，津滬，贛五局各添裝自動發報機一部，㊁上海裝二千華特機一部，㊂廈門裝二百五十華特機一部，㊃南京，長安，蘭州，各五百華特機一部。</p>
<p>（四）長途電話繞路：計設綫五○七七公里，增音站已裝竣者，計南京，上海，漢口，殷家匯，九江五處，正在裝設及卽將裝設者，計南昌，銅山，鄭縣，巴縣，長安，長沙，沅陵，江山等八處。</p>
<p>（五）國內無線電話：滬機裝置於眞如劉行國際電台內，漢機則於漢口之羅家墩為發話台，武昌長波台為收話台，粵機發話台設廣州東石牌鄕，收話台設鶴邊村，均已於二十五年下半年內完全通話、</p>
<p>（六）成都廣播電台工程設備，業經完竣，遂於上年十一月間正式播音。</p>
<p>丙，電信業務</p>
<p>關於電信業務，過去半年內改進之點甚多，一一縷述，恐為時間，所不許，而其大體方針，在於“便利通信”“增加效率”“推廣營業”三點。這三點有個一貫性卽連環性，譬如要通信的便利，必然要效率的增加，效率能增加，營業才能推廣。反之，效率不能增加，則通信不能便利，通信不便利，營業何能推廣？這是顯而易見之理。茲將半年來之電信業務工作報告如左：</p>
<p>（一）關於便利通信者：㊀整理船舶電台，㊁委託車站收發電報，㊂編訂蒙文電報符號，㊃减低國內電報價目，㊄减低國際新聞電報價目，㊅改善交際電辦法，㊆規定電報收據寄還辦法，㊇重訂市內電話價目，㊈取銷長話保證金，㊉减低呌人通話價目等：</p>
<p>（二）關於增加效率者:㊀有綫電報改裝鑿孔機與印字機，㊁無綫電報添裝自動收發報機，㊂疏通有無綫電報務，㊃整頓處理報務辦法，㊄規定使用市內電話方法，㊅改善處理長途電話手續等：</p>
<p>（三）關於推廣營業者：㊀重訂中法無綫電報務合同，㊁進行重訂中德與簽訂中蘇無綫電報務合同，㊂進行簽訂中美與中英無綫電話務合同，㊃推廣市內電話營業區域，㊄推廣市內公用電話，㊅重訂國內長途電話營業通則，㊆開放滬漢與滬粵長途無綫電話，把通話範圍之空間距離，增加至一千二百公里左右，㊇增加長途電話互通地點四四五處，把通話範圍之綫路距離，自五六○公里增至一一五二公里。</p>
<p>以上均係半年來電信業務之改進辦法。此外關於整頓官軍電報收費，亦值得報告：查歷年官軍電報發報字數，佔電報全體字數百分之六十以上，欠費達三百萬元以上，電政經濟，受了如許重大的影響。兪代部長代理部務後，認為電政開源方法，首在整頓官軍電報收費。爰呈准行政院，自二十五年七月一日起，嚴令執行一官軍電報收費及限制辦法，“一面呈准軍事委員會重行劃定剿匪區域，並頒布“剿匪區域軍事緊急機密電報臨時辦法，”實行以來，大見成效。每月收入，可增加四五萬元。各政軍機關所發電報，除少數外，大多數均能照章付現，目將非必要的電報，自行限制，不若以前之隨意濫發了！</p>
<p>丁，電信人事</p>
<p>半年來電信人事之設施，其重要事項如左：</p>
<p>（一）開辦報務員訓練班近數年來，各局報務人員退休，死亡，及去職者，為數甚多。所有缺額，亟待補充，本部爰在南京，上海，漢口，南昌，廣州，鄭縣，濟南，長沙，杭州等九處，登報招考高中畢業生二百名，卽在各該地電報局內開班訓練，授以電信基本學校及技能，定期半年畢業，以資補充。</p>
<p>（二）核定各局辦事人員名額各局名額十餘年來，向未正式核定，致人同多寡不一，勞逸不均。本部為節省經費及增加工作效率起見，經派員分赴各繁要局，實地調查，按照實際需要情形，核定名額，業已先後發表，嗣後調派人員，均有標準。</p>
<p>（三）各局報話人員加受軍事訓練查電信交通，關係軍事甚鉅。故報話人員對於軍事學識應有相當訓練，以便勝任愉快。本部有鑒及此，爰遴派各局靑年報話人員，分批予以軍事訓練，俾有健全的軍事常識與體格。</p>
<p>戊，電信財務</p>
<p>二十五年下半年營業項下，以國際報費收入最旺，有綫報費，因整頓官軍電報費，第月約增加四五萬元，已如上述，市內電話局所加多，長途電話九省工程次第通話，以是自七月份起，市內每月較前約增收一萬餘元，長途電話謹九省許劃內各綫，由一萬一千餘元，已增至三萬元左右。綜計報話費各項收入，每月現金由一百八十餘萬元，漸增至二百萬元有奇。至支出方面，經常開支，平均月約一百五十萬元左右，收支兩抵，本有盈餘，惟以償債本息擔負太重，各種建設材料需費甚多，是以不敷甚鉅？半年來猶特另舉新債。以資維持，將來業務發展，債務减輕，電政經濟，自有發達的希望。</p>
<p>上項所述，均係二十五年下半年電信施政情形之犖犖大者。因為時間所限，不能一一縷述，非常抱歉。總之：電信事業，現在已到“自力更生”的時期，同時電信同人，均有“努力向上”的氣象。嗣後國家政治日漸安定，工商業日趨繁榮，利用電信者必多，那末，電信事業，必然蒸蒸日上了！</p>
<h3>交通部國內長途電話之兩種新辦法（續）</h3>
<p>— 溥沾</p>
<p>新年之新貢獻</p>
<p>二·呌人通話於接通時，發話人或指定之受話人適因事外出，如發話用戶確知該發話人現在何處，或受話用戶確知受話人現在何處，而該處亦裝有與發話用戶或受話用戶隸屬於同一市內電話營業區域之電話者，該用戶卽可將該處電話號碼，告知電局改接，倘電局改接至該處後，仍未呌到發話人或受話人時，自應照章納費銷號，如經呌到通話時，僅須繳納通話費，不因改接手續，加收其他費用。</p>
<p>時代之輪，將人類的生活，從單簡演至複雜，由窄狹展為廣闊，同樣對於電話的應用、亦自近及遠、由市內而長途，在現代的中國，當然還有不少不知道使用電話的民衆，但同時也有很多不能一刻離開使用長途電話的忙人；交通部為應時代之需要，對於長途話路的擴展，固無時不在埋頭苦幹，卽對於長途電話業務，亦莫不以用戶利益為前提，積極改進，過去的不說，卽如最近規定在二十六年一月一日施行之已繳納長途電話保證金，或已填具接通長途電話聲請書之登記用戶，得借用未登記之用戶話機，傳發長途電話；與呌人通話發受話人因事外出，得由發話或受話用戶聲請電局將長途電話改接至發話或受話人所在處所之話機通話等兩項辦法，雖然其範圍僅限於同一市內電話營業區域以內，可是為使用長途電話之發受話人的便利上着想，已經是無微不至了。（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>“禁慾”與“殺機”</h3>
<p>— 羣</p>
<p>十四日各報有一則這樣的新聞：</p>
<p>“揚州人汪葆祿，現年五十八歲，向在本市某教會充任牧師，並無妻子，與本地人秦聯濤相友善，秦現年二十有六，亦中饋猶虛，以是與汪過從甚密，每於公餘之暇，輙至汪寓盤桓，忘年之交，友誼彌篤。近秦山戚友之介紹於本月一日，娶某氏女為室，新婚燕爾，與汪過從遂疏，詎汪雖年近耳順，而熱情未减，覩秦迷戀新歡，頓忘故友，不禁妒火中燒，於是一變其慈祥愷悌之牧師面目而萌殺機。……”</p>
<p>讀了這樣的新聞，是會使人大惑不解的：旣是友誼彌篤的忘年之交，何以朋在結婚了反會妒火中燒而萌殺機呢？</p>
<p>我不解。但我記起了長期禁慾會使精神變態的話來，恰好那位兇手又是個牧師，現年五十八歲了，還是“並無妻子”，於是我便不由得不疑心到所以會頓萌殺機者，大概就為了精神變了態的緣故。</p>
<p>手頭有本魯迅先生的雜感集“墳”，這中間有篇“寡婦主義”，中間就有說到獨身者的精神變態的，現在抄一段在下面，作為“殺機”的解釋。——</p>
<p>“至於因為不得已而過着獨身生活者，則無論男女，精神上常不免發生變化，有着執拗猜疑陰險的性質者居多。歐洲中世的教士，日本維新前的御殿女中（女內侍），中國歷代的宦官，那冷酷險狠，都超出常人許多倍。別的獨身者也一樣，生活旣不合自然，心狀也就大變，覺得世事都無味，人物都可憎，看見有些天眞歡樂的人，便生恨惡。尤其是因為壓抑性慾之故，所以於別人的性底事件就敏感，多疑；欣羨，因而妬嫉。其實這也是勢所必至的事；為社會所逼迫，表面上固然不能不裝作純潔，但內心却終於逃不掉本能之力的牽掣，不自主地蠢動着缺憾之感的。”</p>
<p>用這段話來解釋“而萌殺機”的原因，想來茫不會錯到那裏去的。雖然這還有待於專門家來證實。不過以我們的皮毛之見，則知道在變態心理者，一絕對地成為找的所有物”的愛的獨占慾是特別强的，例子很多，“迷戀新歡，頓忘故友，因而萌殺機”者，也可以算是一個例子。</p>
<p>把問題引開去，那自然得追問何以會形成獨身主義者了，這解答其實在上空也是有了的，例如“中國歷代的宦官，大都是“為社會所逼迫”而成的。然而“表面上固然不能不裝作純潔，但內心却終於逃不掉本能之力的牽掣，不自主地蠢動着缺憾之感的”，於是慘劇成矣。</p>
<p>不過，事雖這樣，在中國一向的傳統觀念上，却總是主張着“六根清凈”的，尤其是一談起“性”字，便會掩面而逃，宛如逢到什麽洪水猛獸。</p>
<p>雖然事到今日卽使是頂着“六根清凈”的牌子的和尚，密藏嬌娃者有之，為財產而打官司者也有之，但“性”之成為洪水猛獸，却是依舊的。</p>
<h3>加拿大同胎五姊妹的懲戒室</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>以馳名全球的狄盎恩五小姊妹攝製的五福臨門，已在本埠開映過，想讀者還沒有忘記。現在這五小姊妹還住在一座特建的精緻育兒所裏，仍舊由醫學博士達福氏主管，另有看護婦三人，教員一人，監護誤導。她們一言一行，好像專制時代的皇帝，有起居注一般，都詳細記下。假使內中一個犯了過，便怎麽辦呢？達福醫學博士是不主張用體罰的，所以對於她們五小姊妹，從未施過體罰。於是便想了個法兒，把那犯過的孩子，閉在一間特闢的“靜室”裏，不許她和其他四姊妹同在一塊兒玩耍。那“靜室”除供懲戒之用外孩子中患了傳染的病，也使她住在裏面。和其餘數姊妹隔開。</p>
<p>據達福醫學博士說：“這是育兒所中的唯一懲戒兒童過行打的方法。在五孩還小的時侯，我們只不許那行為有不好的孩子和其餘四姊妹，一同玩耍，使她有些兒感觸。現在孩子比較大了，這個法兒已不行了，於是不得不把那不好的一孩另外閉在一個‘靜室’裏。那‘靜室’長八呎，寬六呎，裏面很光明，有大玻璃窗放入充足的陽光空氣也流通，和育兒所其餘各室相同。室內只置一棹一椅，和幾本圖畫書，一切都很安舒。但是有兩件事情，却須特別注意：一件是室內毫無能使兒童損傷自己的物品，另一件是懲戒的要素，必須使她獨個兒留在室中，和其餘姊妹隔開，使她感到寂寞，那便達到懲戒的目的了。”達福氏又說：“我很反對有些父母，把犯過的兒童閉在一間黑室裏，和地窰裏，或閉在卑隘不安舒的處所。那是野蠻而殘酷，這種懲戒，會使兒童的神經系立時或日後發生很不好的影響。我們的‘靜室’却和這不同，兒童留在裏面，很覺安舒，也有其他姊妹所玩的玩具，不過不能和她們在一塊兒玩罷了。我們常常對兒童說明為什麽要把那不好的孩子閉在‘靜室’的原故，又告訴她們，閉在裏面後，只等她脾氣改好，便放她出來，和其餘姊妹在一塊兒玩耍。我們這個懲戒方法，很有效果，所以不必再用旁的懲戒方法。”</p>
<p>現在再把這座育兒所約略說幾句。在初建的時候，孩子還小，只要幾間屋便够用了。孩子漸漸地長大起來了，於是這座房屋也不得不逐步地擴大。裏面分娛樂室，辦公室，臥室，浴室，餐室，廚房。娛樂室中有各種合於年齡，合於時季的玩具，辦公室中掛着許多圖表。那五小孩身體的發育，智識的進步，看了圖表，便能一目了然。浴室中的盥洗具，大浴盆，種種都是特別定製，合於兒童用的。還有特別娛樂室，裏面有小鋼琴，留聲機，和其他樂器。跳舞，奏樂，和講故事，都在這間室內。綜計全屋的一切設備，共値華幣十餘萬元。那欵項是五小姊妹自己賺來的，她們還在銀行中存着許多金錢哩。這育兒所外貌很壯觀，房屋是兩層樓，樓上除所長和友僕兩人的臥室外，其餘的是作為貯藏室，藏着種種目前不用的玩具衣服，內有許多是參觀人所贈的禮品。所內長用的和臨時僱用的人員，常在十人至十五人之間。以後添聘新職員，還要添造新屋。本年夏季以前，準備在該所四周建造長欄，把所屋團團包圍，並將所後的林區數英畝圍入。於是五小姊妹除在廣大的運動塲游戲外，還能在天然林區花草之間，散步消遣，不會走失。那時這育兒所可成一座小小的村莊，彷佛是世外桃源。</p>
<h3>寒風里</h3>
<p>— 雷峯未刻</p>
<h3>看吃槍斃</h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>小時候時當膽大的獨自一個人去看吃槍斃，所謂獨自一個人，也並不是說只有我一個人去看，除了我以外，自然還有許多別的不相識的人，也一同哄去看，那不過說在我只自己一個人罷了。吃槍斃就是殺人，但大家並不直接呌殺人，却都這樣稱呼，也許是為着使它不太顯露，於是給它在字面套上一件外衣，使它藏在里面，不一下五露出它的兇相來。在那里是時常有吃槍斃可看，吃槍斃的地點離我家並不怎樣遠，小孩子原愛亂跑，更喜歡看什麽新鮮奇特的事，於是我便時常去作一個殺人的看客了。</p>
<p>一說起殺人，可以使人心驚肉跳，那是一回多麽可慘可怕的事！大人們照例是絕對禁止小孩們去看，常常警告着說：“不要去看吃槍斃，去看吃槍斃，槍斃鬼的魂靈會跟來，夜里就要做夢！一但我對這話是半信半疑，多半還是不怎樣害怕，所以這警告也就並不怎樣有效，而當吃槍斃的經過，我還是瞞着大人，偸偸的跟着一羣當熱鬧去看的人一同去。</p>
<p>每逢吃槍斃，說熱鬧確也熱鬧，在這個平日同古城一般的地方，就是一件不重大的事也能在人們靜止的心湖中攪起一層波瀾，那殺人的事自然更哄動他們的。吃槍斃的經過時，首先是“達達顚”的號子吹着，大家聽見這習聞的號聲，同兵士聽見集合號一般的都從屋子里走出來，一齊站到路旁去。這時見到的，是一小隊負槍荷彈者，後面跟着去吃槍斃的人，再後就是一羣跟去看熱鬧的，那是給號聲所召來。</p>
<p>據說去吃槍斃的都是一些十惡不赦的殺人放火者，因為是殺人放火者，所以才要去吃槍斃，殺人者也被殺，正合着“以其人之道，還治其身”的那句老話。但是看他們也不怎樣猙獰可怕，同平常人也並沒二樣，不同的就是他們是要去吃槍斃，我們却是去看他們吃槍斃的。那末他們好好的又為什麽要去做殺人放火的事？這可沒有機會問他們一問，這時候他們是正要去死，除了活就是死，還有什麽呢？</p>
<p>那些去吃槍斃的背上是插着一面頂端三角的狹長的白布旗，上面寫着“槍决盜犯×××一名”的黑字，在字的四周都圈着紅圈，同小學生的習字卷子一樣。他們的二手是反綁着，脚上带着脚鐐，脚镣的鐵環互相擊碰，托郎托郎的響。他們步履給艱的走着，是逐步的走向死去。但是可相信他們一定不願死，而要活！現在却不給他們活，而要他們去死的。</p>
<p>在途中，他們有的却也現着泰然不在乎的樣子，就是所謂“神色自若”的了。有的還唱着小調，也說“再二十年又是一條好漢”的話，於是那些看熱鬧的人都嘖嘖稱贊着，稱他們“眞是不怕死的好漢”！自然不會有人去替他們想一想，想他們這時候在這下意識的舉動下的眞實心情是怎樣。那也許是給劇烈的恐怖所襲擊所佔有了，也許是在極度的混亂中還想到要活，但是活顯然是已絕望了。</p>
<p>當到了刑塲，在槍聲起處，他們便撲向地面，在抽搐了一會後，便不再動彈，這樣的，在一分鐘以前還是一個活生生的人，在一分鐘以後就被奪去了寶貴的不可再得的生命。但是對這人生最悲痛的一幕，沒有誰動哀感，自然是看的人與他們並不相關，也為他們原是該死（？）該死的人有什麽可憐？大家是反熱烈的鼓掌，大聲的喝采呌好，不過關於這，據說却是為着保身，因為這樣可以把冤魂嚇散，不會跟到人身上來。</p>
<p>這樣說，那又何必要看？不看不更省事？但是大家却不，逢有吃槍斃總還是又要看，又怕冤魂跟上來，眞是可笑之至。不過這本來也需要大家去看，有人看，才有它的意義，為看“以儆效尤”，為着“殺一懲百”，才那樣的先把號子“達達顚”的吹起來，告訴人：要殺人了，大家來看，看你怕不怕！那是被這樣作用着的。</p>
<p>一方面殺人，一方面被人殺，又一方面却是漠然的。而且還在一旁呌好，世界彷佛就是這樣維持着的。而他們不但是呌好，更會嫌吃槍斃沒有殺頭好看，會有聲有色的描寫着，說殺頭“發擦”一聲，頭顱扑的滾下，紅的血馬上像噴泉一樣的冒出來，眞是好看！於是老前輩的便談起當年殺革命黨的事，一般後生小子就恨自己生得晚，看不到，而羨慕他們曾看過的。想到讓這情形繼續着，該會有一個多麽可怕的結果？</p>

<h3>完美的恐怖影片「夜半歌聲」</h3>
<p>請諸位注意中國影壇不久將要有一部恐怖而又滿含着詩意的影片出現了，這是新華公司耗費鉅大資本時間攝製的「夜半歌聲」</p>
<p>我們現在這裏向諸位預先作一些報告：這部「夜半歌聲」是馬徐維邦導演的，馬徐維邦導演的戲有人説充滿了傷感的氣味，其實它是更有着積極向上的意義的，「夜半歌聲」就是描寫一個青年在惡勢力的環佈下怎樣奮鬥的故事。</p>
<p>故事的展開是在一個陰森無人的戲院空屋中，在夜半萬籟俱寂的時候，發生一陣疑神疑鬼的歌聲和一個面目猙獰類似殭屍的人物。爲了全劇得到充分的效果，對於背景的佈置，光綫的構造，以及各個人物面目的化裝，都帶上恐佈的性質，特創了一種風格。</p>
<p>演員方面，這裏除了「狂歡之夜」中有非常收穫的胡萍，金山，顧而已，施超，顧夢鶴，王爲一這幾位藝人之外，又加入了周文珠，許曼麗，蕭英等幾位極富名望的大明星，由於分配的適當，每個人都愉快地勝任了他所擔當的角色。</p>
<h3>大光明映「胡鬧學士」</h3>
<p>大光明大戲院今日起換映浪漫歌舞滑稽鉅片「胡鬧學士」Irs　Great　to　Ba　in　College，該片爲二十世紀福斯公司最新名貴出品，由十大滑稽歌舞明星聯合主演，在美國影片中，以大學或足球爲背影的，已經有過幾部，而「胡鬧學士」一片；雖然也用上面所述的題材，描寫美國大學士的浪漫化和足球熱，但是演出方面，與他片絶對不同，它有着新奇的歌舞和新奇的笑料，自開塲以至於收塲，觀衆祇覺得熱鬧，有趣和好笑，絶對没有一尺膠片，令人感到沉悶，這的確是一個不可多得的娱樂影片，能值任何人笑口常開。</p>
<h3>「戲劇工作社」排演「日出」散記</h3>
<p>盛傳已久的「戲劇工作社」排演「日出」，現在已經在積極凖備中了，每晚常常排到深夜方止，雖是在這末寒冷的冬天的夜裏，却始終没有一點倦意，愛好戲劇的精神，可見一斑。</p>
<p>導演者歐陽予倩先生，近來是特别的忙碌，一方面熱心地在排演「日出」，另外在其他的劇團他還擔任着導演的工作。</p>
<p>「日出」這一個劇本，是無需介紹的，凡是看過曹禺先生第一部創作「雷雨」的觀衆，我想一定會注意的。在「日出」裏，他的更深刻的觀察，比「雷雨」是愈見成功。全劇緊張生動，每一幕都能够引起觀衆高漲的情緒，將來演出時的轟動，定可以預料。</p>
<p>據該劇社的負責人説，他們在上海公演以後，預備再到南京去公演一次，如此則首都觀衆眼福誠不淺矣，先爲預告。</p>
<p>該劇社的大部份參加者，都是前「復旦劇社」的舊員，他們過去的成績，是深印在觀衆的腦海裏，其它的人員，也都是劇壇的第一流人材，此次携手合作，定可更見完美。</p>

<h3>Mi Chunlin Arrives in Shaanxi to Persuade Yang to Obey the Central Government</h3>
<p>Li Zhigang Flies Back to Luoyang Yesterday; Sun Weiru's Troops Are Reorganized; Zhou Enlai and Others Engage in Extensive Activities; Xi'an Residents Feel Panic</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Mi Chunlin flew to Xi'an on the 15th aboard a Eurasia Aviation plane. After landing in Luoyang for refueling, he continued to Xi'an, arriving in Shaanxi around 2 PM. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Yang Hucheng's representative, Li Zhigang, flew to Xi'an a few days ago to convey the central government's intentions to Yang Hucheng. He flew back to Luoyang from Xi'an on the 15th and will arrive in Nanjing within a day or two. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The former chairman of Liaoning Province, having arrived in Nanjing from Xi'an and met with central authorities for several days, flew directly to Xi'an on a Eurasia Aviation special plane at 9:30 AM on the 15th. He conveyed the central government's leniency regarding the handling of the aftermath of the Shaanxi Incident and its deep concern for the people of Shaanxi. He hoped that Yang Hucheng would appreciate the central authorities' sincere concern for the country and its people, immediately obey orders, and handle the aftermath of the Shaanxi situation according to the central government's plans. It is reported that Mr. Mi arrived in Xi'an around 2 PM to meet with Yang Hucheng and others, conveying everything. He will return to Nanjing in a few days to report. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] Tongguan reports that the Northeast Army may be willing to submit, but Yang Hucheng is still hesitant and indecisive. Communist troops have entered Xi'an, and the people are panicking. Military experts say that the Zhang and Yang factions are dividing, making the Shaanxi situation easier to resolve. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] A chartered plane flew directly from Nanjing to Xi'an this afternoon, carrying passengers, indicating that there is still a way to resolve the Jingbian Incident. The internal sentiment within the Northeast Army is particularly strong. Yang's troops in Shaanxi have destroyed the Chishui Road bridge. To date, the losses to the Longhai Railway are nearly 20 million. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Mi Chunlin, who previously flew to Nanjing from Shaanxi, completed his business in Nanjing and flew to Xi'an with Liu Zushun and others on the morning of the 15th. They will instruct Yang Hucheng, Yu Xuezhong, and others to comply with the central government's established plans for the aftermath of the Shaanxi and Gansu situation within a set period. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] A traveler returning from Xi'an reported that the communist bandit Mao Zedong has dispatched the communist bandit Zhou Enlai to Xi'an to extensively win over the generals of Zhang's and Yang's troops, hoping to communize Xi'an. There are many left-leaning elements within Yang's troops, who are easily swayed. Zhang's troops have complex ideas and are not easily lured. Wang Yizhe, Miao Chengliu, He Zhuguo, Dong Yingbin, and others are currently undecided. Ma Zhanshan was appointed commander-in-chief of the cavalry group army, but seeing the deteriorating situation, he has expressed his resignation. There are many conflicting opinions within Zhang's and Yang's troops, and they have held meetings for days without reaching a clear solution. The communist bandit Mao Zedong has dispatched a large number of political work communist troops to participate in the activities of various units in order to manipulate them. Xi'an merchants and residents are in a state of panic due to the increasing influence of the red bandits, and the order is chaotic. They are fleeing eastward, but transportation is blocked. In the countryside, soldiers and bandits are rampant. Staying in the city is frightening due to the impending war, causing Xi'an to revert to the chaotic state of the incident. There is no clear leader. Although Yang Hucheng has been promoted to commander-in-chief, the Northeast Army has ultimately failed to obey his command. Chishui and Weinan are still heavily fortified. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Peng Dehuai's Second Army Corps, approximately 20,000 men, is moving south from Sanyuan, appearing to be heading towards Xi'an. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Yang Hucheng and Yu Xuezhong are not accepting the central government's advice and are actively preparing for war. Yang Hucheng abruptly alerted the newly appointed Shaanxi Chairman Sun Weiru on the 13th and reorganized his troops. Mao Zedong, who has formed an agreement with Yang Hucheng and others, has successively ordered communist troops to concentrate in the areas of Xi'an, Xianyang, and Sanyuan. The Liberation Daily in Xi'an and the Xi'an Broadcasting Station have been broadcasting anti-central government propaganda for days. The city is completely communized. (15th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Nan Hanchen, a famous red bandit in Shaanxi (also known as Nan Ruji), reportedly arrived in Xi'an on the 5th, making Yang Hucheng's attitude even more stubborn. Recently, Nan and the red bandit Chen Zijian have been described as Yang's right-hand men. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Yang Hucheng has expanded Wang Dianwu's 49th Brigade, Zhao Shoushan's 51st Brigade, and Sun Youren's 3rd Shaanxi Police Brigade into divisions. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] The red bandits recently appear to be attempting to cross the river eastward into Shanxi. The National Army has been strictly blocking them. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] It is reported that the red bandits have recently divided into left and right army groups and are moving towards Xi'an from the bandit areas. The left army group is Peng Dehuai's unit, and the right army group is Xu Xiangqian's unit. It is also reported that Xu Haidong's unit is also moving towards the vicinity of Xi'an. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] Yang Hucheng recently proclaimed himself commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces. In order to create a false impression of strength, he announced Sun Weiru, Miao Chengliu, Wang Yizhe, Yu Xuezhong, the communist bandit Mao Zedong, and the communist bandit Peng Dehuai as commanders-in-chief of the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Army Groups, respectively. However, Yu Xuezhong refused the false appointment and is unwilling to be used by Yang. Yang has colluded with the red bandits. (15th Central Telegram)</p>

<h3>Bandit and Puppet Troops Are Prepared and Scheduled to Launch a General Attack on Xinghe</h3>
<p>With Wang Ying's and Zhang's Troops as the Main Force; Assisted by the Puppet Xing'an Garrison; Large Quantities of Gasoline and Flour Are Transported to Zhangbei</p>
<p>[Zhangjiakou] According to reliable information on the 15th, the bandits and puppet troops in northern Chahar, under the protection of a certain party, are prepared and have decided to launch a general attack on Xinghe in eastern Suiyuan from Nanhangqian on the 25th. Wang Ying's and Zhang Wanqing's bandit troops and Zhang Hai peng's Jehol troops will be the main force, assisted by the puppet Xing'an Garrison. The head of a certain party's Zhangbei special affairs agency ordered all merchants and residents in Zhangbei to refuse to use Bank of China banknotes from the 12th onwards. Those who disobey and exceed ten yuan will be executed, in order to sever economic relations with the mainland. In addition, twenty-five trucks carrying 500 boxes of gasoline and 1,800 bags of flour were continuously transported from a certain place to Zhangbei. (15th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to sources concerned, it is reported that the traitor Li Shouxin has been transferred from Dolon to Chengde by a certain party and is being monitored. The reason is that Li's units are showing signs of wavering, and in addition, more than 200 puppet troops stationed near Shangdu recently mutinied. A certain party is suspicious and has therefore detained Li and transferred his troops to Dolon for reorganization. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Guihua] The Chahar puppet bandits are still moving around frequently, eyeing eastern Suiyuan covetously, and eagerly plotting to invade. In addition to ordering the garrison troops in the front to be on strict alert, the military commanders have also heard that if the puppet bandits invade, they will immediately implement a campaign to suppress them.

<h3>Letter of Advice to Northeastern Soldiers from Fellow Northeasterners in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Should Take Loving the Country as Their Duty; Do Not Easily Believe Others' Instigation</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Fellow Northeasterners in Nanjing issued the following letter of advice to Northeastern armed soldiers on the 15th: Dear Northeastern armed soldiers, since the September 18th Incident, our elders and brothers have been slaughtered, our ancestral graves have been trampled by the enemy, and even the tragic events of being buried alive and the cruel torture of being sliced to death have been experienced by our Northeastern compatriots one by one. How tragic is this! In order to avenge this great humiliation and to retaliate for the national and family hatred, we can only follow the central government's intentions, obey the central government's orders, and in the unified national salvation steps, obey the leadership of our sole leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, invigorate our spirit, bury ourselves in hard work, strive to suppress bandits and eliminate traitors, and prepare to resist foreign aggression and save the country. Only in this way can we have a day to return to our hometown and a day to avenge ourselves. The central government's post-incident measures for the Xi'an Incident are very lenient, not only in accordance with legal principles but also in accordance with human sentiment. It still trusts the Northeastern soldiers sincerely and relies on them as before. Not only do the people of the whole country support and uphold them, but even Deputy Commander Zhang sincerely admires them, admiring the central government's care for the Northeastern soldiers, showing both kindness and righteousness, without being meticulous. Dear Northeastern soldiers, under such great tolerance and inclusiveness, how should you appreciate the central government's painstaking efforts to preserve the country's strength and cherish the lives of the soldiers? Atone for your sins and make amends for your past transgressions and restore your inherent glory! Unexpectedly, in the past two weeks, you have not only shown no sign of obeying orders, but also reportedly are attempting to cooperate with the red bandits, deploy troops, and build fortifications to prepare to defy orders. We firmly believe that this is only the absurd proposition of one or two people and is by no means the original intention of all our dear Northeastern soldiers. However, if you blindly follow and do not think of extricating yourselves, and are always used by others, then you will forever bear the name of traitors and will never have a day to return home. The army that resists Japan becomes a traitor that destroys the country, and the soldiers who suppress bandits become slaves driven by bandits. How shameful is this! Not only will the people of the country condemn you, but even Deputy Commander Zhang will deeply hate you. Moreover, Deputy Commander Zhang is awaiting punishment in the capital, and the central government treats him generously. Even if our Northeastern soldiers do not consider the country, do you not consider the reputation and future of the deputy commander and yourselves? Turning misfortune into blessing and turning danger into safety lies in your recognizing the great righteousness, resolutely repenting, breaking away from the encirclement of reactionary forces, and showing your position of loyalty to the government. The Northeast has been lost for five years. The elders in our hometown are leading their children, looking westward, praying that the Northeastern soldiers can return home soon and reunite. Therefore, when we hear of the Northeastern soldiers winning in bandit suppression, we are overjoyed. When we hear of the Northeastern soldiers being injured in bandit suppression, we are deeply saddened. It can be seen that your every move is related to the honor and disgrace of the Northeastern elders. Therefore, the elders in the Northeast all hope that you will become a strong force for bandit suppression and a brave soldier against the enemy, and even more hope that under the unified command of the government, you will align your steps, obey orders, and complete the great task of pacifying the interior and resisting foreign aggression, and restoring the inherent mountains and rivers. Dear Northeastern soldiers, you should think deeply, rather than being sinners for all time, why not preserve your limited strength and reserve it as a vanguard against the enemy? Rather than being traitors to the nation, why not cherish the hopes of the elders, reject the rebel orders of the reactionaries, and not make unnecessary sacrifices? In this way, after the recovery of our homeland in the future, you can still obtain the understanding and admiration of the Northeastern compatriots. If you are still stubborn and willing to betray the country, then it will be easy for the central government to eliminate the rebels. You have fought for thousands of miles, and your military life has been full of hardship, all for the sake of loyalty to the country, restoring the homeland, and continuing the lives of the nation and individuals. If you disobey orders and perish together, it is not worth regretting, but your family, old and young, relatives, and friends will all be implicated and will never have the face to meet the compatriots of the whole country. How tragic is that! Thinking of this, I cannot help but feel horrified and burst into tears. Dear soldiers, you should take obeying the leader as your sacred duty and love the country as your goal. Do not easily believe the instigation of one or two people, or listen to the deception of a few traitors. They do not love the country, nor do they save the hometown. They simply want to sacrifice you more than 100,000 strong soldiers to achieve their ambitions. I hope you will be aware of this and hope you will accept the government's post-incident measures. Especially, I hope you will put the country and nation first, and return to your original defense posts as soon as possible. The central government has always been tolerant and will never hold you accountable for your past mistakes. At the same time, we also hope that Yang Hucheng, Sun Weiru, and other military and political authorities in Shaanxi Province will obey the central government's orders, accept the post-incident measures for the Shaanxi Incident, maintain local order, and prevent the spread of red bandits. At this time when foreign aggression is imminent and the national crisis is pressing, we must not further promote the division of the country and give the enemy opportunities for aggression. If you still do not repent and make amends, and if you waste the country's strength and lose the opportunity to recover lost territory, then not only will the government and the people condemn you, but even we Northeastern people who have fled to the interior cannot forgive your reactionary behavior. In short, soldiers take obedience as their sacred duty, and the people take patriotism as the prerequisite. I think our Northeastern soldiers in Shaanxi have always been at the forefront of loving the country and hometown. From now on, do not hesitate on the wrong path any longer, quickly show your attitude, accept the central government's orders, obey the government's guidance, and maintain your military reputation. The opportunity for success or failure is in this moment. We sincerely look forward to your expression of upholding justice. Jointly initiated by 3,549 fellow Northeasterners in Nanjing.

<h3>Civil Service Appointment Law</h3>

<p>[Nanjing] The Legislative Yuan held its eighty-seventh meeting on the 15th, attended by seventy-one members including Ma Yinchu, with Sun Ke as the chairman and Liang Hancao as the secretary-general. Matters for discussion: ㊀ Amendment of Articles 2, 3, 4, 12, and 14 of the Civil Service Appointment Law. Resolution: Passed according to the review report of the Legislative Committee. The phrases "qualified through screening and examination or performance appraisal" in Articles 2, 3, and 4 were uniformly changed to "qualified for appointment." The original Article 12 stated that "newly appointed personnel should be on probation and start from the lowest grade salary, but those who are ranked as commissioned personnel may start from the lowest salary of each grade." The proviso in that article is now amended to "but personnel below the second-class commissioned rank may be granted a grade salary based on their knowledge and experience." The original Article 14 stated that "the provisions of Articles 2 to 4 of this law do not apply to the secretary-general and secretary of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission." Now, the word "may" is added and changed to "may not apply." According to the main points of the amendments to each article, the original rigid regulations are changed to be more flexible based on the experience of personnel administration and consideration of actual circumstances, in order to facilitate flexibility. ㊁ Amendment of Article 14 of the Hunting Law. Resolution: Passed according to the review report of the Legislative Committee, with no need for amendment. The article stipulates that the hunting season is from November 1st of each year to the end of February of the following year. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce believes that hunting for academic research should not be restricted by the hunting season and specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to amend the article. The Executive Yuan considered that the proposed amendments by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce were already provided for in Article 4 of the same law and could be interpreted by analogy. As a result, it was considered that there was no need for amendment. (15th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Goering's Visit to Rome</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>General Goering of Germany arrived in Rome the day before yesterday and is currently meeting with Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ciano in the Villa Medici to discuss various issues between Germany and Italy. We remember that a few months ago, Ciano visited Berlin, which led to the signing of the German-Italian agreement. Therefore, Goering's visit to Rome is likely to produce equally important results. We cannot help but pay close attention to this meeting, which has significant international implications.</p>
<p>Goering, the main figure in this meeting, is the first thing worth noting. He is the Premier of Prussia, the head of the German secret police, the Speaker of the Reichstag, the Air Force Minister, and the Director-General of the newly established "Four-Year Plan." In addition to these many prestigious titles, General Goering recently attracted worldwide attention with his famous saying "Guns instead of butter." In fact, this figure who holds five important positions is no less powerful than Chancellor Hitler in Germany's domestic and foreign affairs. His personal visit to Rome after Ciano's visit to Berlin a few months ago should have even greater implications.</p>
<p>The importance of this Rome meeting can also be reflected in the recent developments in the European situation. The most prominent trend in recent European developments is the increasing severity of internal panic in Germany and its increasingly isolated diplomatic position. A few months ago, Germany experienced a butter panic, which has now developed into a wheat panic. If this deepening panic is not remedied politically and diplomatically, the future crisis will be unthinkable. However, in diplomacy, since the establishment of the German-Japanese alliance and the German-Italian agreement, Germany's position has not only not been strengthened, but has become even more unfavorable. The most obvious point is that the United Kingdom, which has always implicitly supported Germany, has felt threatened by the German-Japanese alliance to British interests in the Far East and by the German-Italian agreement to the British position in Europe. It has changed its attitude and is improving its relations with the Soviet Union while also working closely with France. The signing of the British-Italian Mediterranean Agreement at the end of last month was largely due to France's behind-the-scenes efforts. Due to the signing of the British-Italian agreement, the joint German-Italian intervention in Spain suddenly became a solo act by Germany due to Italy's increasingly lukewarm attitude. As a result, the German military's ambitions in Morocco were immediately met with strong opposition from the United Kingdom, and Foreign Secretary Eden even adopted a more acerbic attitude, criticizing General Goering's "guns instead of butter" policy as inappropriate.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, General Goering's visit to Rome is no small task. His first step should be to further promote closer collusion between the two countries based on the existing German-Italian agreement. His second step is to use Italy's relations to get the United Kingdom to rekindle old ties with Germany. From there, he can further isolate the current close cooperation between the United Kingdom and France. If this mission can be fully achieved, the temporary calm created by the joint efforts of the United Kingdom and France in the past month or two will undergo dramatic changes and become a resurgence of the aggression front.</p>
<p>From Goering's decisive move to go to Rome in person, we feel that he will not return empty-handed. However, we can also see the obstacles he will inevitably encounter in other areas. First, Italy's compromise with the United Kingdom was achieved through France. Italy has maintained relatively good relations with France for a year. It will not be easy for Germany to isolate France now. Second, it is said that the German-Italian talks will include the issue of Germany establishing an airbase on the Italian-held island of Dodecanese. This may not have much to do with Italy, but from the perspective of the United Kingdom's position in the Mediterranean, it can never allow the intrusion of German power. These are the two main points. Of course, Germany's ambitions for Southern Europe and even Spain and Morocco cannot be ignored. What exactly this Nazi leader will bring back from the fascist homeland remains to be seen in the outcome of the negotiations in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Aiming at Transoceanic Offense, America Implements Giant Battleship Policy</h3>
<p>To Start Building Two Dreadnoughts This Summer; Requests Increased Funding for Pearl Harbor Port Construction</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today that the United States will begin construction of two 35,000-ton battleships on June 1st. Their speed will be three to four knots lower than that of other countries' battleships, but their armament and gun caliber will be superior. The new ships of the four countries, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy, all have a speed of 30 knots, while the American ships will only have 27 knots. The Secretary of the Navy and senior officials believe that battleships should have superior offensive power. Therefore, the new ships will be equipped with nine 16-inch guns or twelve 14-inch guns. The final decision on which caliber to use will probably be made after the London Treaty officially expires on April 1st. The Secretary of the Navy also stated that the United States will build twelve new warships this year, including the two aforementioned super-dreadnoughts, five destroyers, three light cruisers, and two submarines. The Navy still opposes building large airships and advocates building more warships. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of the Navy Swanson stated today that the Navy is requesting an additional $2 million for the construction of Pearl Harbor Naval Base, as the $10 million allocated in the budget is insufficient. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The U.S. government aims to build the world's number one navy, and is working hard to complete its existing and new plans. President Roosevelt has issued an order to build battleships, and will begin construction of two new battleships with amazing performance on June 1st. The U.S. intends to pursue its transoceanic offensive strategy by using the principles of large ships and giant guns. The U.S. will ensure the new battleships will have a displacement of 35,000 tons, a speed of 26 to 27 knots, and three gun turrets. The U.S. Navy, which adheres to the principles of large ships and giant guns, is certainly preparing for nine 16-inch, three-gun turrets. Currently, only Britain has two battleships with nine 16-inch guns. As soon as the U.S. Navy enters a treaty-free era, it will begin construction of the world's largest super-dreadnoughts, which is very noteworthy. Therefore, the Japanese Navy is very concerned about the U.S. Navy's active expansion of its naval forces using the principles of large ships and giant guns. Japan can only move towards establishing an independent economic and military structure in order to ensure control of the Western Pacific. (Domei News Agency, 15th)</p>
<h3>Italy Sends Note to Britain Accepting Naval Restrictions</h3>

<p>Barcelona According to news from the besieged port of Malaga, 65 miles northeast of Gibraltar, the Nationalist forces launched their second fierce attack on the port this week from the air, land, and sea, causing many deaths and injuries and much damage. According to a communiqué from the Spanish government's air and naval ministries in Valencia, two rebel cruisers, one gunboat, and several small boats participated in the attack, and a squadron of twin-engine aircraft assisted from the sky. Government aircraft dropped two 200-pound bombs on the rebel cruiser "Admiral Cervera," which quickly sailed towards Ceuta. The other enemy ships also dispersed quickly. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>Gibraltar According to news from Avila, a plot by government troops to bomb and attack the Nationalist forces in the villages of Bobadilla and Arrebatacapas was recently discovered.

<h3>Göring's Continued Talks with Italian Prime Minister in Rome</h3>
<p>Spanish Situation as Main Topic, Consensus on Joint Defense Against Russia</p>
<p>[Rome] German Aviation Minister Göring continued his talks with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia this afternoon for over two hours. Afterward, the Prime Minister hosted a banquet at the palace to welcome Göring. Responsible sources confirmed that the discussions between Mussolini and Göring focused solely on the Spanish issue and did not touch upon commercial matters. As for rumors that Italy would act as an intermediary between Germany and Britain to bring them closer, similar to the Anglo-Italian Gentleman's Agreement, political figures have neither denied nor confirmed them. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Le Matin recently published news from Rome stating that Mussolini and Göring have agreed to exert their best efforts in diplomatic channels to prevent the establishment of a Soviet republic in Spain. They will also bring to the attention of other countries the Soviet Union's propaganda activities within Spain. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Regarding the details of the talks between the Italian Prime Minister and General Göring today, various newspapers believe that the main topic of discussion was the attitude that Germany and Italy will adopt towards the Spanish issue in the future. Giornale d'Italia reported, "Regarding the issue of prohibiting volunteers from enlisting in Spain, in short, negotiations on the entire issue of non-interference in the Spanish civil war are nearing their final stages. General Göring's visit at this juncture is naturally of utmost importance." Giornale d'Italia further explained that if a government controlled by the Soviet Union were to be established in Spain, it would pose various dangers. "This is a matter of concern for both Germany and Italy, and they should take steps to prevent it. However, this shared stance of the two countries is purely defensive. This is true not only for the Spanish situation but also for the situation in Europe and the Mediterranean. Furthermore, Germany and Italy hold completely consistent views on the Spanish issue. This is not due to the ideological connection between Germany and Italy, but because Spain is also a European country and has inherent ties with Germany and Italy in terms of politics and culture. However, it is strange that other countries, especially those that are satisfied with the current state of Europe, do not share this feeling." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Various newspapers here have commented on German Aviation Minister General Göring's visit to Italy, with some saying, "Göring's trip is intended to draw Italy into the vortex of the Spanish civil war," or "While Göring was holding talks with Mussolini, the anti-French movement in German newspapers resurfaced," or "The news carried by German newspapers about the establishment of a Soviet republic in southern France is mere rumor and slander, intended to allow Germany and Italy to freely reject Britain's proposal to prohibit volunteers from enlisting in Spain." L'Ère Nouvelle, the newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party, reported that German newspapers are now heavily publicizing the following issues: "A Soviet republic has now been established in Perpignan, southern France," or "The French government will be overthrown," and "France has no control over the areas bordering France and Spain, making it impossible to control the situation. Therefore, Germany should refuse to accept Britain's proposal to prohibit volunteers from enlisting in Spain." L'Humanité, the Communist newspaper, reported, "Germany and Italy are currently employing tactics to relentlessly attack France. Their intention is to incite distrust among the British public towards the policies adopted by the French government, especially regarding the Spanish civil war. At the same time, Germany and Italy will accuse France of being an ally of communism and violating the non-interference policy, thereby continuously interfering in the Spanish civil war." Le Peuple, the organ of the General Confederation of Labor, reported, "It would be foolish to dream that the German and Italian fascist countries will abandon their adventurous actions in Spain."

<h3>France Forbids Volunteers from Going to Spain</h3>
<p>Government Asks Parliament for Authorization to Issue Substitute Ordinances at Any Time</p>
<p>[Paris] The government has submitted a bill to the Chamber of Deputies to prohibit volunteers from going to Spain. The bill proposes granting the government full powers for a period of six months, during which the government may issue substitute ordinances at any time to prohibit the recruitment of volunteers in France to enlist in Spain. Violators will be subject to imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of 100 to 10,000 francs. Prime Minister Blum personally attended to explain that the government will issue an order prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain as soon as other related countries implement the same ban. He insisted that the Chamber of Deputies should begin discussing the bill tomorrow to demonstrate the French Parliament's determination. Once an international agreement is implemented, France will take the same measures as other countries regarding the prohibition of volunteers. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>[Paris] The Legislative Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has unanimously passed the government's bill prohibiting volunteers from going to Spain. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>Anti-French and Anti-Czech Propaganda in German Newspapers Intensifies</h3>
<p>Deliberately Creating an Atmosphere of Soviet Activity; France and Czechoslovakia Deny and Refute as Groundless</p>
<p>[London] After the situation between France and Germany regarding the Moroccan issue eased slightly, the actions of German newspapers have recently caused renewed unrest in Europe. The news of communist activities in southern France carried by right-wing French newspapers has become excellent material for German newspapers, as they are reprinted with the title "Soviet Rule in Southern France." In addition, European capitals are quite disturbed by German newspapers' propaganda that there is also Soviet activity in Czechoslovakia. According to German newspapers, several groups of people wearing Soviet uniforms have been seen participating in military exercises near the border. However, impartial observers say that the reports in German newspapers are completely unfounded, and there is little sign of Soviet activity in Czechoslovakia. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The anti-French movement in German newspapers has recently intensified, causing concern among diplomatic circles. The French Embassy has held talks with German authorities, informing them that this attitude of German newspapers is causing many inconveniences and should be addressed. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>Perpignan, Southern France: German newspapers have repeatedly reported in recent days that a Soviet regime has been established in southern France, with Perpignan as its center. The mayor of the city, Senator Béra, has stated that this news from the German side is completely fabricated and not worth laughing at. At the same time, the City Council unanimously passed a motion protesting the rumor that the city has become a center of unrest, stating that the residents of the city and the residents of the Pyrénées-Orientales department to which the city belongs are living in peace and tranquility, and no incidents have occurred. The City Council also decided to forward this protest to several ministers in Paris for their review. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>[London] German newspapers have recently repeatedly engaged in anti-Czech propaganda, claiming that the Czech army and administrative organs have been dominated by Soviet forces. The Czech side has responded by stating that there is absolutely no Soviet influence in the Czech army and administrative organs, and the claim that there are many Russian officers in the Czech army is untrue. As for the Communist Party in Czechoslovakia, it is the same as the Communist Parties in other democratic countries and only expresses its political views in parliament. British diplomatic circles are paying close attention to this statement from the Czech side. In addition, Germany has also claimed that the Soviet Union has built an airfield in Czechoslovakia to serve as a base for the Soviet air force. Regarding this matter, the Czech government suggested to Germany that the German air attaché stationed in Czechoslovakia should conduct an on-site investigation to determine whether this is the case, but the German government did not respond. The Czech government has now decided to make the same suggestion to other countries, including Britain. It is reported that Britain has dispatched its air attaché to conduct an on-site investigation.

<h3>Roosevelt Does Not Intend to Interfere in European Affairs</h3>
<p>US Democratic Party Congressmen Advocate Amending Neutrality Act</p>
<p>[Washington] There are widespread rumors abroad that President Roosevelt intends to convene an international conference to discuss the issue of maintaining peace. Official sources have not confirmed this, and political figures also say that the President is unlikely to take this step. Moreover, if France and Germany can find a way to resolve their economic disputes, their relations may improve. Therefore, President Roosevelt is even less likely to initiate this international conference. In addition, the President is very busy dealing with domestic issues and has little time to deal with foreign affairs. For example, several laws are about to expire and need to be extended by Congress, especially the Neutrality Act, which will expire at the end of February. The new bill will be submitted to Congress for discussion and is expected to be voted on in May. According to some powerful figures in the United States, they have long wanted to urge President Roosevelt to interfere in various international issues, especially European issues, but so far, these attempts have not been successful. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Twenty-five Democratic Congressmen held a secret meeting today to amend the Neutrality Act. The current Neutrality Act stipulates that the President has full power to decide whether to embargo arms, but they advocate that it should be stipulated in a mandatory manner that arms should be embargoed to all belligerent countries. Progressive Democratic Congressman Maverick, who is most strongly in favor of a strong neutrality policy in Congress, said that he fears that recent US arms shipments to Europe have been transferred to Spain. He supports Congress stipulating that arms should be embargoed to any area in a state of war. It is reported that the faction in the House of Representatives that advocates a mandatory embargo will cooperate with some senators, such as Nye, to find a way to bring the Neutrality Act up for debate in Congress again. At the same time, Senator Lundeen of the Farmer-Labor Party and Congressman Johnson have simultaneously proposed in both houses that the government take over the arms industry and prohibit private individuals from engaging in the import and export of arms.

<h3>Adjustment of Relations between Britain and Southern Ireland</h3>
<p>De Valera in London, Talks with MacDonald</p>
<p>[London] Irish Free State Executive Chairman de Valera and Dominion Affairs Minister Malcolm MacDonald met twice in London yesterday, much to the surprise of the general public. It is reported that de Valera was returning to Dublin from Switzerland and took the opportunity to visit MacDonald. It is said that the focus of the talks was mainly on the outstanding political and economic issues between Britain and Ireland. Although the meeting lasted for five hours, it cannot be formally considered helpful, and there were no formal decisions. It is reported that the attitude of both parties during the talks was extremely sincere, so the general public hopes that this meeting may be the beginning of resuming negotiations, which may produce more concrete results. It is also reported that the two parties also discussed the issues of the Free State's participation in the coronation of the British monarch and the Imperial Conference, as well as the constitutional status under the recent legislation of the Free State. There are also claims that the financial opinions between Britain and Ireland must have been mentioned in this meeting for fair adjustment. Some people also believe that de Valera is quite concerned about the recent activities of some Irish people participating in the Spanish civil war, so the issue of non-interference in the Spanish civil war must have been discussed in this meeting. It is reported that de Valera quite agrees with Britain's non-interference policy and the general direction of British foreign affairs, and also expressed his support for the national defense plan. The meeting between de Valera and MacDonald has caused surprise and satisfaction among people everywhere, especially in Dublin. Today, The Irish Times reported that the people of both countries are eager for the past misunderstandings between Britain and Ireland to be eliminated as soon as possible. From a political point of view, the current situation is indeed much better than before. What the Irish people are asking for is nothing more than: ㊀ a resolution to the economic war, ㊁ a more permanent agreement with Britain to protect the status of citizens of the Irish Free State.

<h3>President of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce Addresses the China Issue</h3>
<p>Regrets Attitude of Japanese Government and Public, Each Party Discusses Foreign Affairs Questions, Seiyūkai and House of Peers Advocate Caution</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry held a New Year's banquet at the Tokyo Kaikan on the evening of the 14th, inviting four cabinet members, including Baba, Ogawa, Hayashi, and Nagata, to attend. President Yūki Toyotarō spoke on the China issue, stating that the chamber earnestly hopes for the adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations and the cooperation between China and Japan, to become a stabilizing force in East Asia, establish peace in the Far East, and bring prosperity and welfare to the people of both countries. There is no room for debate that with Japanese capital and technology, combined with China's labor force and resources, the boundless wealth of cotton, coal, and iron mines can be developed. If the state of trade is adjusted, Japan will gain a huge market, and China's 400 million people will also get cheap and good goods, which is obviously beneficial to each other and brings mutual prosperity. If both China and Japan cling to the various past events, there will be various arguments. However, at this time, it is necessary to sweep away the old viewpoints, return to the original good neighborly relationship, and gradually remove the causes of confrontation to carry out adjustment work. According to my observation, there are regrettable aspects to the attitude that Japan and the Japanese people have taken towards China in the past. We firmly believe that the Japanese people have a great need for self-restraint, and that Chinese intellectuals and the public should also abandon their past prejudices and advocate cooperation from a general perspective to achieve Sino-Japanese friendship. On this occasion, I solemnly declare that this chamber is ready for concrete issues concerning economy and trade to carry out adjustment work with China. (Domei, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The House of Representatives' negotiation committee on handling foreign affairs held a meeting at the new Diet building from 1:00 PM on the 15th to discuss questioning on foreign affairs issues. The Seiyūkai and Minseitō parties, as well as other factions, expressed their opinions, but the Minseitō party maintained a cautious attitude and was unmoved. In the end, the small committee advocated retaining the disposition of the old urgent resolution, and no conclusion was reached on that day. Therefore, the handling method for foreign affairs issues after the resumption of the Diet will be discussed again to deploy the questioning array. The meeting adjourned at 3:30 PM. (Domei, 15th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The various factions in the House of Peers are deliberating on countermeasures for various important issues due to the impending resumption of the Diet, and each faction is taking a particularly cautious attitude towards foreign affairs issues. The Kenkyūkai held its first regular meeting of the tenth year on the 14th to exchange opinions on foreign and domestic affairs. The Kōseikai also, in view of the importance of foreign affairs issues, studied countermeasures by a special committee and decided that the national policy on foreign affairs should not be used as a tool for political strife. Merely observing the surface of the Arita diplomacy and opposing it would be too hasty. If one is not familiar with the real situation of foreign affairs and criticizes the authorities, there is a risk of inducing domestic turmoil. Therefore, it is not advisable to submit proposals on foreign affairs issues. Although political parties may take this action, the House of Peers should adopt a cautious attitude from its own independent standpoint. (Domei, 15th)</p>
<h3>International Drug Trafficking Case Adjudicated in the US, Wynn Marie Sentenced to Twenty Years in Prison</h3>

<p>Los Angeles: Ms. Wynn Marie, a Eurasian woman, 24 years old, came to the United States from Shanghai last August, carrying narcotics worth US$100,000 in her luggage, including 48 pounds of heroin, which could be sold for about $50,000 in the United States.

<p>[New York] Two Chinese sailors on the Blue Funnel Line mail ship Melampus were arrested by customs officials today on suspicion of smuggling opium into the United States. (National Telegraph, 14th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Treasury Secretary Morgenthau met with reporters today and commented on the interception of opium worth US$76,250 on the British ship Melampus, saying that the cooperation between the British crew and US customs officers has made it necessary for the Treasury Department to waive or greatly reduce the fine that should be imposed on the ship. According to the law, the ship carried more than 4,000 ounces of opium and should be fined up to $100,000. According to a statement from the US Treasury Department, the opium seized was mixed with other goods, and the amount was the largest of any case broken in New York. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>[Manila] The Philippines, the only Catholic country in the Far East, will host the 33rd International Eucharistic Congress, which is scheduled to open here on February 3 and close on the 7th.

The following three days are designated as Women's Day and Children's Day, and Mass and other religious services will be held inside and outside the church. On Sunday the 7th, Mass will be held in all churches and at the specially built altar in Luneta Park, followed by solemn processions and other programs. The Pope's personal blessing will be transmitted by radio, broadcast through loudspeakers, and end with a closing speech, at which point the Congress will officially conclude. It is expected that at least 800,000 people will gather in the churches and squares on the last day to receive the Pope's blessing. Accommodation in hotels, temples, and schools was booked out months ago. During the few days of the Congress, Catholic churches in several parts of the world will also convene Catholics to hold religious ceremonies, remotely echoing the Congress. Suiyuan, China, is also among them. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<h3>Continued Exposure of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Zhengzhou Plotting to Harm Our Country</h3>
<p>Commissioner's Office Releases Some Documents Utilizing Bandit Riots and Han Traitor Investigations</p>
<p>(D) Relations between China and Japan are extremely dangerous. From Chiang Kai-shek downward, all call Japan an "enemy," and the anti-Japanese sentiment is increasingly fierce. In Central China, in order to prevent the infiltration of northern Japanese forces, the Yellow River is used as a barrier against Japan. Military affairs, politics, trade, and commerce are all arranged in defensive positions, determined not to let the Japanese cross the Lei Chi River one step. Henan is the front line, the Yellow River is the front, and the Longhai Railway is used to cover it. There are also the Jinpu and Pinghan Railways, and a number of highways and air routes, to connect with the rear. Zhengzhou is the intersection of the Pinghan and Longhai lines, and can be called an important place. Because it is a commercial port, there is superficially no reason to refuse Japanese residence, but the Chinese side often says, "Although commercial ports allow merchants to reside, military and political figures are not allowed to reside and operate." In the name of protection, secret agents follow to investigate their actions, never leaving for a moment. The consul holds a "hands-off" policy on all Chinese actions, only lamenting that "diplomacy without real strength behind it is equal to zero." The Longhai Railway Bureau does not purchase cheap Japanese goods, and the Kaifeng Chamber of Commerce promotes that Japanese sugar contains toxins, arresting and threatening Chinese who purchase it, using every means possible. Is this what you call neighborly harmony? In reality, they are just trying every possible way to drive out the Japanese. The adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations is hopeless, and the future is bleak. Even if there are any results in the future, it will only be a temporary expedient to avoid war. If there is no particularly major change, shaking hands between the two countries is fundamentally unthinkable. If this stalemate continues for several years, there will eventually be a break. The purpose of establishing the Zhengzhou agency is really here. Sun Tzu's "Use of Spies" chapter says, "Loving money of a hundred gold coins, not knowing the enemy's situation, is the height of inhumanity. Such a person is not a general, not an assistant to the ruler, not a master of victory." The Zhengzhou agency is really set up in this important place to investigate the enemy's situation and overcome all difficulties. Personal hardship and persecution are accepted with joy. It would be a great loss to the purpose of establishing the agency and would violate the determination to sacrifice if we bear the heavy responsibility of not being able to find out the enemy's situation. However, what is the real situation of the Zhengzhou agency?</p>

Automobiles carrying smuggled goods, guarded by ronin, drive on various roads, unscrupulous. The following is a record of the latest developments.</p>
<p>Manchuria Company</p>
<p>Recently, a certain country's merchants such as Shimomoto Seiichi, supported by the authorities of that country, have established a long-distance automobile company in Tianjin that runs from Tianjin to Rehe Chengde, Chaoyang, Outer Mongolia Kulun, Pingdiquan, and other places. It is named "North China Manchuria Liaison Transportation Company." The address has been found on Fushimi Street in the Japanese Concession. The capital is set at 500,000 yuan, and it is planned to purchase 80 large long-distance heavy-duty automobiles. 40 vehicles have already arrived, and it is scheduled to open temporarily on the 15th. The internal divisions of the company include transportation, sales, liaison, and public relations. It has already started operations. Its business scope is purely to be responsible for freight transportation, with dedicated bodyguards escorting smuggled goods, such as hemp, sugar, textiles, medicines, and all foreign goods, and can be responsible for transporting them to destinations. Branch offices have been set up in Duolun, Kulun, Chaoyang, Chengde, and other places. After the company opens, the sales channels for smuggled goods can invade the hinterland of Mongolia and Rehe.</p>
<p>King of Smuggling</p>
<p>Tianjin's only smuggler is Xie, the younger brother of Xie Jieshi, the treacherous "Manchurian" Foreign Minister, nicknamed the "King of Smuggling." He established the "International Trading Company" in a certain neighborhood of the Japanese Concession, dealing in smuggled goods such as rayon, white sugar, and foreign cloth. It is reported that the "King of Smuggling" has a total of more than 300 followers, one-third of whom are ronin from a certain country, with dedicated responsibilities for bodyguarding, escorting goods, and collecting payments. He is the largest smuggler in Tianjin. In the past two years, he has earned millions of yuan. The "King of Smuggling" has connections with the military, police, and consulates of a certain party. He is able to command great respect within a certain concession. His subordinates also employ several people from a certain country to serve as bodyguards. His arrogance can be seen from this. Recently, in order to facilitate control and protection, a certain party has restricted the emergence of small smugglers and is actively suppressing the existing "special trade merchants" in order to increase the power of the "King of Smuggling" and make the smuggling organization unified.</p>
<p>Ronin Bodyguards</p>
<p>When the Prevention of Road Transportation Smuggling Inspection Office first moved to Tianjin, smugglers were slightly cautious because they feared that smuggled goods would be confiscated and confiscated. The automobiles transporting smuggled goods to Gaoyang and various counties in southern Hebei mostly changed to driving at night. However, the security of the anti-smuggling personnel of the Prevention of Road Transportation Smuggling Inspection Office has not yet been agreed upon, so the days have been spent busy with investigation work. Li Tonghua, the deputy director of the office, is currently negotiating in Jinan on the issue of intercepting smuggled goods. It is expected that anti-smuggling work will begin after Deputy Director Li returns to Tianjin. Tianjin smugglers, having learned of the above situation, have recently become even more unscrupulous. Automobiles transporting smuggled goods travel back and forth day and night, but the cars are all flying the flag of a certain country, guarded by ronin, one to three people per car, depending on the value of the goods. Outside Tianjin Customs, patrol officers have cracked several cases. The customs authorities have recently established strict anti-smuggling measures, but the profits from smuggling are very high, and smugglers are not afraid of this minor loss, even if they are occasionally confiscated and confiscated.</p>
<p>Beining Railway</p>
<p>The Beining Railway had very prosperous freight transportation in the twenty-fifth year. The main income was the transportation of smuggled goods from Qinhuangdao to Tianjin. Merchants from a certain country shipped smuggled goods by sea, landed in Qinhuangdao, paid a quarter of the customs duties to the "Jidong" puppet organization, and forced them to transport to Tianjin on the Beining Railway. These smuggled goods flowed in like a tide every day. Last year, the Tianjin General Station had the strange incident of the Beining passenger car bow being crushed and damaged due to overloading of smuggled goods. Incidents such as axle burning delays and ronin escorting and forcibly boarding passenger cars became commonplace. According to the announcement of the Beining Railway Bureau, the total operating income in the twenty-fifth year was more than 29 million yuan due to prosperous freight transportation, an increase of more than 4 million yuan compared with the twenty-fourth year. This was thanks to smuggling. However, since this year, smugglers have mostly used automobiles to transport smuggled goods, via Tanggu, along the Tianjin-Tanggu Road to Tianjin, or via the Luan Tong Road to Tongzhou and then to Beijing, so it is unknown when this unprecedented ugly international trade drama will end.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Merchants and People Firmly Request Changes to New Business Tax Standards</h3>
<p>If Requests Are Not Granted, They Will Suspend Business Pending a Decision. Merchants from All Industries Claim the New Tax Makes It Difficult to Operate.</p>
<p>The Guangdong Finance Department's changes to the business tax assessment standards have caused panic among all merchants and people. Representatives from various business firms believe that at a time when commerce is declining, only one in a hundred can maintain the status quo, let alone make a profit. They once gathered at the Guangzhou Municipal Chamber of Commerce to request that the government be called upon through the Chamber of Commerce, but according to official sources, the authorities will promote the business tax throughout the province this time, and the newly revised assessment standards are considered appropriate and will be implemented. On the business side, they are still in a wait-and-see position. Originally, starting in January, they would have to handle matters according to the new tax standards, but recently very few merchants and people have reported according to the regulations. Furthermore, it is heard that the opinions of all merchants and people are that if the government forces the implementation, they will have no choice but to suspend business pending a resolution. From this, one can see a glimpse of the merchants' and people's hardships.</p>
<p>On the 8th of this month, merchants from all industries once again convened a meeting of representatives from all industries and decided on the following three methods: ㊀ Support the resolutions of the two meetings of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the 5th and 7th. ㊁ Each should carefully examine the relationship between the new business tax and the interests of their respective industries, formulate detailed opinions, and send them to the Chamber of Commerce immediately for vigorous advocacy. ㊂ If the government cannot withdraw its order to continue to use the 25th year's tax assessment standards, they will have no choice but to implement a uniform suspension of business and wait for a complete solution to show their determination. After learning about the situation, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce decided to collect the submissions from various merchants and submit them to the authorities for processing during the day. It is found that merchants from all industries have already sent submissions to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in recent days. Here are a few excerpts to clarify the inside story. The submission from the sugar and noodle industry reads: "We believe that Guangdong has the most miscellaneous taxes in the country. If merchants and people can barely afford it, they will pay according to the regulations, but today's change in the business tax rate is not only difficult to implement, but it also leaves most shops with no business to operate, let alone pay taxes. Because the current tax rate cannot tax goods, it conflicts with the central government's original tax rules. It is simply a transfer price tax law. Since the beginning of taxation, there has never been a tax name that collects unlimited times. Moreover, Guangdong has the fewest products, and most products rely on foreign imports. Shops that directly import goods from outside have larger capital and fewer numbers. Among the shops that resell in the city, the middle and lower-level shops account for 80% to 90%. If taxes are levied on business income, each resale will be taxed once. If the resale is unlimited, the tax will be levied an unlimited number of times. In this autumn of commercial decline, business is thin, and encountering multiple levies will definitely increase costs. Then, except for a few shops that directly transport and sell, most of the middle and lower-level shops will inevitably have no business to operate. Therefore, our industry, etc., believes that this type of tax rule is completely unworkable. As for the claim that the business tax revenue itself is less than others, it should be known that Guangdong's unique miscellaneous taxes are ten times the burden of Guangdong people compared to other provinces. Guangdong is the source of the revolution and has been ravaged by warlords many times, with everything plundered. Now that political power is unified, we still beg for the realization of relieving the people of pain. Therefore, we have slightly practiced one or two, hoping that you will adopt them and convey them to the government, and quickly withdraw the new chapter on business tax to ensure commercial stability. Not only will the business firms be fortunate, but also the people in the city will be very fortunate." Another submission from the gold foil industry reads: "We have received the Guangdong Province Business Tax Collection Regulations, which list the scope of gold foil in the third level of goods sales and tax is calculated according to the total business income, etc. After hearing the order, the entire industry was shocked. We think that the gold shop's signboard indicates buying, selling, and exchanging, which is completely floating in nature. Its function is the same as the silver industry, but the price is a hundred times higher than silver. In the past, when paper money was not in circulation, buyers mostly benefited from its light and easy to carry, which could be used as a side product. Gold merchants make jewelry to earn a small amount of money. For the value of the gold, we follow the bank's regulations, buy and make on behalf of others, and cannot take more than the quota. The entire industry relies on credit, buying and selling daily, rotating rapidly, specializing in exchanges, and constantly flowing. Often the capital is not much, but the monthly amount often exceeds millions. If taxed according to the total income, the price of gold will be extremely high, and it will suffer from increased burden. The industry's transactions are all the same gold, and it must be increased more than ten times to be effective. The silver industry is not taxed according to the total income, because it is also a silver coin that is transferred and collected repeatedly and cannot withstand the cumulative tax. We hope that your association's leaders and merchants will not sit idly by and not save us, but argue reasonably and submit a correction so that the bank will calculate the tax according to the capital amount to show fairness and justice for the public" (January 12th)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Investigate the Hengjing Land Case Thoroughly</p>
<p>Ben Shucheng, a resident of Hengjing Township, reported that Sheng Ke'an, the squad leader of the militia training team in the township, was selling private soil. The Public Security Bureau sent personnel to the township and seized 200 liang of private soil in the team headquarters, but Sheng Ke'an himself was snatched away by the team's militia. Sheng's wife, Zhu, was detained and sent to the county government for detention. On the 14th, it was discovered that eight liang of the seized opium soil were missing. The truth is unknown. On the 15th, the county government's special commissioner Du, who was in charge of the opium case, summoned the relevant public security officers in the township for interrogation. The results showed that the township police officer Sheng Jianxiong and others were highly suspected, but because Sheng was a current official, the Public Security Bureau's Chief Inspector Qiang Lei was responsible for supervising him, ensuring that he was available at any time, so that a thorough investigation could be carried out.</p>
<p>Regulate the Rickshaw Rental Price</p>
<p>The labor and capital sides of the Wuxian rickshaw industry had a dispute over the rickshaw rental price, which has been unresolved for several months. The County Party Department and the County Government have now set the rickshaw rental price at 35 fen per day as the legal amount based on the actual situation. It will start on February 1st and cannot be changed. The labor side is satisfied with the above regulations, while the capital side is scheduled to convene a general meeting on the 16th for discussion.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Trial of German Causing Disaster Case Opens</p>
<p>On the 29th of last month, a German, Ping Ke, drove his own car, Shanghai City No. 9326, along the Xihu Highway to Yanxiang in Changshu, knocking down and crushing a villager to death. At that time, the German surrendered to the local Public Security Sub-Bureau. After mediation, the German compensated 300 yuan for the funeral expenses. The public office believes that the case concerns human life and is a public prosecution case, and the Public Security Bureau should not have released the perpetrator. The trial was still scheduled to open on the 15th, and the German was arrested by the Public Security Bureau. As a result, he did not arrive. The bureau will now order the guarantee to hand him over. Also, the German's 300 yuan in funeral money has not been paid to this day, and the family of the deceased is also investigating.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>10,000 Shi of Glutinous Late Rice Exported</p>
<p>According to a recent request from the Rice Industry Association, the Yinxian Food Management Committee reported that there was an excessive amount of glutinous late rice in stock. They requested that another 20,000 shi be transported to Shanghai for sale. After the seventh meeting of the committee, it was decided that in order to take into account the financial situation of the rice industry, permission was granted to continue transporting 10,000 shi for export, but the transport permit will only be issued after the previous glutinous late rice has been fully offset.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>300 Farmers Petition</p>
<p>The newly formed sand land in the Nansha area of Xiaoshan is no less than several thousand mu. After the new owners bought it, the issue of renting the sand land to the sand people has not been resolved. Therefore, the flood victims and poor farmers along the river, because they have no way to rent the new sand, once gathered in the county and petitioned the County Party Department, the County Government, and the County Farmers' Association, pleading for assistance. On the morning of the 13th, because the spring flowers they planted were all dug up by the owners, more than 200 people gathered again in the city to make a second petition to maintain the lives of the disaster-stricken farmers.</p>

<h3>West Qing Basketball Tonight</h3>
<p>Jinan to Reunite with Maxwell I</p>
<p>The West Qing basketball schedule for last night originally had three matches. The first match was in the Ordinary Group, Mingqiang vs. Yuezhong, which had been brought forward to last Saturday, with Yuezhong winning 45 to 36. Last night's schedule was canceled.

<h3>Central Government Formulates Regulations for the Organization of Sports Associations in Provinces, Counties, and Cities</h3>
<p>Circular to Provincial Party Headquarters for Notification</p>
<p>The Central Executive Committee considers the establishment of sports associations in provinces, cities, and counties to be of utmost importance for the implementation of national physical training. Currently, many provinces, cities, and counties do not yet have such organizations, and even those that have been established lack a complete organizational system, making it difficult to achieve effective results. Therefore, a set of organizational regulations for sports associations in provinces, cities, and counties has been drafted.

<h3>Ministry of Education Orders Zang Qifang to Take Over Northeastern University as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>Northeastern Notables to Form Organization to Maintain School Affairs</p>
<p>[Special dispatch from Beiping] Since the new Acting President Zang Qifang came to Beiping, he has been conferring with the authorities and relevant parties in Beiping regarding the takeover of Northeastern University. On the 13th, Zang visited Liu Yifei and others, held talks, and issued a statement explaining his views on the opinions expressed in the previous day's interview with the current secretary and director of the Dongda. The Ministry of Education sent a telegram to Ping, addressed to Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, and Zang Qifang, stating that the ministry has the right to inquire about the president of Dongda, and the authorities have forwarded the telegram and the previous day's telegram from the Ministry of Education to Dongda for compliance. The 25,000 yuan subsidy for Dongda from the Ministry of Education for last month has been remitted to Ping. Zhou Jingwen, the secretary and director of the school, is still working at the school, and rumors of his trip to Beijing are inaccurate. The student union of the school hosted the press, reporting the reasons for opposing the takeover and sending a telegram to Song Ziwen, requesting that the current state of Dongda be maintained. The students also sent representatives to Baoding and Tianjin to visit the university committee members Wan Fulin and Wang Shuhan, requesting them to come to Ping to jointly maintain the existence of Dongda. They returned to Ping on the 14th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Education Telegram</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education sent a telegram to Ping yesterday regarding the appointment and removal of the president of Dongda, addressed to Song (Zheyuan), Qin (Dechun), and the new president of Dongda, Zang Qifang, explaining everything. The original telegram from the Ministry of Education is recorded below: "True telegram received. The organization outline of Northeastern University has been approved by the ministry, which states that the president should be appointed by the government. The University Committee has no right to inquire. The minister has already telegraphed Song (Zheyuan) and Mayor Qin (Dechun) in detail and requested Brother Xixi to jointly instruct the director of the telegraph bureau to proceed immediately. Xipeng."</p>
<p>Northeastern Notables</p>
<p>Northeastern notables in Ping, Hu Yukun, Liu Yifei, Fu Zhankui, Shao Wenkai, etc., believe that the Ministry of Education's reorganization of Dongda and the appointment of Zang Qifang as acting president are related to the future of the highest institution of learning in the Northeast, and they are deeply concerned that unexpected events will occur due to the takeover. At 11:00 AM on the 13th, they specially hosted a banquet for Zang Qifang in their capacity as fellow villagers, expressing their attitude towards the takeover of Dongda, advocating for peaceful methods, and hoping that the matter would be handled through legal procedures and after the Xi'an Incident is completely resolved and the political situation has a clear trend before discussing the Dongda issue, hoping that Zang would temporarily postpone the takeover to avoid causing unexpected events. The resolution of the Dongda reorganization issue will be discussed and resolved jointly by the University Committee of the school and the Northeastern elders. It is generally speculated that a "Northeastern University Maintenance Association" will be organized, and the association will elect a president to temporarily maintain the school until the political situation is clear before making long-term plans. The school authorities and students are now working hard on this and are actively contacting the University Committee and Northeastern notables.</p>
<p>Zang Qifang's Talk</p>
<p>Zang Qifang told reporters that his trip to Ping to take over Dongda was on the order of the Ministry of Education. When he first received the order, he repeatedly declined because the reorganization of Northeastern University was complicated and he was busy with the Wuxi Special Commissioner's Office. Later, he received an order from the Minister of Education, so he went north. Therefore, everything will be handled according to the wishes of the authorities. When he started his trip north from Nanjing, the Ministry of Education asked him to bring the 25,000 yuan subsidy for Dongda for December. Because it was inconvenient to carry, he remitted it to Ping today. This proves that…</p>
<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Schedules Distribution of November Education Fees</h3>
<p>Scheduled for the 18th and 19th of this Month</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau announced that the bureau is scheduled to distribute the November regular fees for municipal schools and social education institutions on the 18th and 19th of this month (i.e., Monday and Tuesday). The notice specifies the fee distribution dates and times for different districts and is announced for general knowledge. All schools and institutions are required to report the collection of various fees and the expenditure statements for each month to the bureau before the fee distribution period and come to the bureau to collect the fees on time. Attached is the fee distribution date and time schedule: 18th: Hubei South, Zhabei, Yinxing, Jiangwan, Wusong, Yangjing, Gaohang, Pusong, Zhenru, Caojing (all schools); 19th: Fahua, Luxing, Yinxing, Gaoqiao, Pengpu, Tangqiao, Yangsi, City Center (all schools), municipal social education institutions. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM. The educational authorities aim to treat all events equally. According to reports, the current Secretary and Director of Dongda, Zhou Jingwen, made four points in his statement. Regarding the first point, that the president of Northeastern University must be elected by the University Committee and the Ministry of Education has never intervened, the Ministry of Education has sent a telegram to Ping stating that the ministry has the right to inquire about the president of Dongda and ordering the school to comply. Regarding the funding of Dongda, since Dongda was founded in 1922 by Wang Minyuan, the former Governor of Fengtian Province, the school's funding has been paid by the treasuries of Fengtian and Heilongjiang provinces. Therefore, the tuition fees collected from new students from Jilin are more than those from Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces. The claim that President Zhang (Xueliang) raised the funds himself is inaccurate. After the incident occurred, the Ministry of Education, in addition to allocating 25,000 yuan per month (and 25,000 yuan annually), used it to enrich Dongda's equipment. In short, his trip to Ping to take over Dongda was on the order of the Ministry of Education to avoid any misunderstandings and to find a peaceful takeover method, and everything was in accordance with the intentions of the Central Government.</p>

<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's Winter Vacation Training Session for Compulsory Education Workers Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Director Pan's Speech, Section Chief Jiang's Report, Training Starts Today and Ends at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The Winter Vacation Training Session for Compulsory Education Workers, organized by the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, held its opening ceremony at the auditorium of Shangwen Elementary School at 1:30 PM yesterday, attended by Director Pan, Section Chief Jiang, Li Wanyu, Xue Weiran, Qian Fugong, various lecturers, and students such as Ling Hongji and over a hundred others. Section Chief Jiang, as chairman, reported on the preparations. The director gave a speech on the mission of short-term elementary school teachers. The session is scheduled to begin today and end on the 31st of this month. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Section Chief Jiang, as chairman, reported that since the city's short-term elementary schools have been operated concurrently under the orders of the ministry, it has been a year and a half, but the exam results are still not satisfactory. There are many reasons for this, but the human factor is the main reason. Therefore, in order to enable teachers to deeply understand the meaning of short-term elementary schools and strive to serve, a winter vacation training session has been held. Attendees include principals and teachers of short-term elementary schools, teachers of affiliated short-term elementary school classes, and teachers of the two-part system. Most of them are current workers, and a few are selected personnel. There are about 140 participants in total, with girls accounting for one-third. The courses are all about supplementing research and discussion. The training will start on the 16th and end on the 31st, for a total of 16 days. It is hoped that the maximum harvest will be obtained in the shortest possible time. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone will not be absent or take leave. The dormitories are located in Xicheng for boys and Wuben for girls. The daily performance will be examined, and the quality of the performance is related to the assigned work. Therefore, it is hoped that everyone will work hard.</p>
<p>Director's Speech</p>
<p>Director Pan then gave a speech on the importance of compulsory education. Everyone has already taken on this work and should understand the importance of their responsibility. However, according to investigations and inspections, the past results have not been satisfactory. There are certainly many reasons for this. It is hoped that after this training session, everyone will be able to correct the past shortcomings as a result of discussion. The following are a few suggestions for everyone: ⑴ Those in charge of running short-term elementary schools must be faithful. Faithfulness means being loyal and striving in one's duty, recognizing that this work is very important and doing it sincerely and earnestly, without fear of any hardship. In the past, some people could not be faithful in their duties, treating this work as a casual occupation to deal with personal life, without understanding its meaning. For example, some people temporarily pull together and decorate the number of students due to the inability to recruit students. This is unfaithful. It is hoped that after the training session, everyone will be able to put forward discussions at any time to change this phenomenon, and then do things in a pragmatic and down-to-earth manner. ⑵ Teachers of short-term elementary schools must make double efforts. We know that the country is running short-term elementary schools as a last resort. If the country had money, it should enable school-age children to receive six years, at least four years of education. But China does not have money, so they can only receive one year of short-term elementary school education. One year is very short, and the results are already very small. But if teachers do not work hard, it can be said that nothing will be gained. Therefore, everyone must work harder than teachers in ordinary elementary schools, shoulder such a heavy responsibility, and do such difficult work, working hard, fearing that they will not be able to catch up, and must not be negligent. ⑶ Teachers of short-term elementary school classes should not only teach them to read and write, but also teach them the principles of being human. The meaning of education is not just reading and writing. This is only a small part of education. According to the new saying, education is to change the old bad ones and to be the new good ones. The Doctrine of the Mean says, "What Heaven imparts is called Nature; following Nature is called the Path of Duty; cultivating the Path is called Instruction." Instruction is to cultivate the Path, to cultivate the Path of being human. The Path is to follow emotions, to control human nature is the Path, and Nature is inherent. Everyone must use the inherent performance to lead this Nature, which is the Path, and to cultivate this Path is Instruction. Therefore, education is to use acquired methods to remedy the shortcomings and deficiencies of inherent Nature. Students in short-term elementary schools only have this one year of opportunity to receive education, so they must be taught to be human within one year, to become sound citizens. This depends entirely on the teachers, who must be able to set an example to teach them the principles of being human, so that they can read and write and know how to be human. This is the best result. In short, education is a spiritual cause. The more spirit everyone has, the more results there will be. We must work earnestly and strive to live up to the country's expectations.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Education Funds for January to be Issued Within the Month</h3>
<p>The January expenses for various Jiangsu provincial middle and primary schools, vocational normal schools, and social education institutions will be issued soon. As the schools will begin their winter break on the 18th of this month, the Bashan Jiangsu Education Fund Auditing Committee signed off on the expenses early. Therefore, the Jiangsu Education Fund Office has already issued payment notices for the first half of January to each school and institution. Schools can receive half a month's worth of expenses before the holiday. The payment notices for the second half of January are currently being reviewed by auditors in a meeting, and they are signing off on them separately. After the processes of submission for review and stamping are completed, it is estimated that the funds can be issued before the schools reopen at the end of this month.</p>
<h3>President Li of Peiping Normal University Visits Minister Wang in Nanking</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 15th Dispatch) Li Zheng, President of Peiping Normal University, arrived in Nanking from Peiping on the morning of the 15th. In the morning, he went to the Executive Yuan to meet with He Lian, Director of the Political Affairs Department. In the afternoon, he went to the Ministry of Education to meet with Wang Shijie, reporting on the university's affairs and making some requests.</p>
<h3>Qinghua Elementary and Middle School Celebrates 10th Anniversary Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng Shuhua, the principal of Qinghua Elementary and Middle School on Baike Road in this city, is diligent in his work, and the school's affairs are flourishing. To commemorate the school's 10th anniversary, a student achievement exhibition has been held at the school since the 12th. Many people have visited the school, earning high praise from students' parents. The school will also hold a celebration at the Gengxin Stage on Niuzhuang Road at 1:00 PM today, inviting famous Peking opera performers You Jusheng and Wen Lanting to perform.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau Stipulates Free Quota for Supplementary Schools</h3>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau of this city notes that there are many out-of-school youths in this city. Some students come from impoverished families and cannot afford tuition, which prevents them from continuing their education. This is deeply regrettable. It is now stipulated that private supplementary schools should set a free quota equivalent to 15% of the total number of students, and joint supplementary schools should set a free quota equivalent to 10%. The free quota should be at least 15% for the 25th year, and it should be increased by 5% each year until it reaches the standard of 30% in the 28th year. Provisional measures for setting up free tuition in joint supplementary schools have been established. Yesterday, all private and joint supplementary schools were ordered to strictly comply with the regulations and report accordingly. Students who are confirmed to be from impoverished families, are physically healthy, and have excellent academic performance can apply to the school for free tuition to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Zhencui Elementary School Established</h3>
<p>Zhencui Elementary School, along with an affiliated kindergarten, has recently been newly established in a four-story building at No. 1510, the intersection of Aiwengyi Road and Hede Road in the western district of this city. The school building is spacious, the facilities are excellent, and the natural settings are even more complete. The classrooms are appropriately arranged and well-lit. It is reported that the school's directors include renowned figures in the education field such as Li Denghui, Xiong Xiling, Guo Bingwen, and Wu Shougong. Ms. Guo Meide, the principal, is a Master's degree holder from the University of Michigan in the United States. She has served as a female student advisor and professor at Fudan University, as well as the director of academic affairs at Peicheng Girls' Middle School. Invitations have been sent to various sectors to visit on the 23rd and 24th of this month.</p>

<h3>All Sectors in This City Strive for National Salvation Through Unification Movement</h3>
<p>Joint Signatures Publish Declaration</p>
<p>Recently, university presidents, professors, primary and secondary school principals, teachers, writers, journalists, and people from industrial and commercial circles in this city, in view of the previous Liangguang and Xi'an incidents, which were all resolved by the central government through political means, believe that the opportunity for unification in our country has clearly become mature. However, the aftermath of Shaanxi and Gansu is still awaiting central government planning and disposal, and the Communist Party and frustrated politicians are妄想试图 to take advantage of the remaining feudal forces, hoping to form a separatist situation, which is contrary to the current needs of China. It is generally believed that China has undergone more than 20 years of struggle, sacrificing countless lives and property, to create a unified situation. It will never allow anyone to use any excuse to destroy the unification, and it must be supported by the power of the whole people. Therefore, they have launched the "National Salvation Through Unification Movement" and drafted the "National Salvation Through Unification Declaration," widely soliciting signatures. It is heard that cultural circles in various places are also signing up to join. The original text of the declaration is as follows:</p>
<p>Declaration of National Salvation Through Unification</p>
<p>1.  The crisis of 1936 is over, but the enemy's ambitions have not been extinguished, and the world's war machine is approaching day by day. 1937 will undoubtedly not be a "year of peace." The current issue for us is "What should we do?" We must resolutely resist the enemy and defend ourselves, and we must also work hard to prepare for the current world war. To resist the enemy and defend ourselves, and to cope with the war, we must first achieve the true unification of military orders and political power. Once the war breaks out, the transfer of supplies depends on the convenience of transportation, and the funds and equipment depend on the development of industry. This also requires the national economic construction to catch up. To achieve the goal of economic construction catching up, political power must be absolutely unified. Otherwise, local operations will only give the enemy opportunities to defeat us individually. Backward construction will inevitably lead to a great lack of military supplies. Therefore, our current national salvation work, whether it is resisting the enemy or construction, must take consolidating unification as the first step.</p>
<p>2.  History tells us that without Cavour's unification movement, Italy would not have had the possibility of prosperity. Without Bismarck's central centralization movement, Germany could not have succeeded in the 1870 war. Without the Meiji Restoration's abolishment of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures, Japan could not have jumped into the ranks of the powerful countries. Without Kemal's national revolutionary movement, Turkey could not have escaped the control of Britain and Greece. The current stage of China is just like Italy in the era of Cavour, Germany in the era of Bismarck, Japan in the era of the Meiji Restoration, and Turkey in the era of the national revolution. In terms of Chinese history, the national destiny was prosperous whenever the unification was completed, and it entered a state of decline and chaos and tended to perish when the phenomenon of disintegration occurred. Therefore, China's need for unification is an unshakable truth in this time of urgent crisis. Under this extremely urgent need, we cannot fail to recognize all the forces of "anti-unification."</p>
<p>3.  There are three forces of "anti-unification": ㊀ The remaining feudal warlords, ㊁ The Chinese Communist Party and the so-called "People's Front" or "United Front," ㊂ Traitors who act as accomplices for the enemy, such as Puyi, Yin Rugeng, De Wang, Li Shouxin and others. All three of these should be resisted. However, we still eagerly expect that these people who harbor the intention of anti-unification can have a practical repentance with the renewal of the years, and turn the attempt to obstruct unification into an action to support unification. If the evolution of the facts matches our expectations, and the people of anti-unification can turn around and stand on the front of supporting unification, it will naturally be a great blessing for the country and the nation. If these people are stubborn and unyielding, or accustomed to separatism, or willing to be puppets, or recognize the enemy as their father, or act as accomplices for the enemy and seek glory by betraying the country, then we have no choice but to consistently resist them. We must know that the current unification is only the prototype of unification, but the price that our country and nation have paid for unification has been extremely huge. If we have paid such a large price and still cannot maintain even the prototype of unification, then our past 30 years of revolutionary sacrifices will not become sacrifices without value. We must also know that our enemies are using divisive tactics at any time and anywhere to realize their dream of dividing China and carving up China, so that our country cannot be revived through unification. Therefore, in order to cherish this prototype of unification, and in order to nurture this prototype of unification and make it grow, we will never allow the remaining warlords and shameless politicians to continue their separatism, and we will never allow the Communist Party and traitors who are willing to be puppets and accomplices to run rampant.</p>
<p>4.  It is particularly noteworthy that the warlords used to advocate "joint provincial autonomy" in order to maintain the separatist situation. Today, the Communist Party, in its twilight years, also sings the praises of "People's Front" or "United Front." What is the "People's Front"? It is to incite the people to resist the government in order to destroy the order of the country. What is the "United Front"? It is to unite all the remaining feudal forces in order to obstruct the unification of the country. For example, the Xi'an Incident recently instigated by the Communist Party is a ironclad proof of the Communist Party wearing the guise of "People's Front" and "United Front" to strike at China's unification. How can the Communist Party not know that a country cannot have two governments? If it has the sincere intention of saving the country, why not abolish the "Chinese Soviet?" How can the Communist Party not know that the division of military power and military orders is not enough to fight against foreign enemies? If it has the sincere enthusiasm to resist the enemy, why not abolish the "Red Army?" Moreover, facts speak louder than words. The Communist Party's "Chinese Soviet" and "Red Army" are all manipulated by the evil hand of foreign interference in China's internal affairs. Its essence is no different from the puppet organizations in eastern Hebei and the pseudo-coalition army in Suiyuan. We dare to say that wherever the evil hand of interference in the internal affairs of other countries extends, it is not for the benefit of the country where it is located. There are too many examples of distant events to mention. Just in the recent past, it is enough to make us feel cold. For example, has Spain not become a battlefield for the red and black international forces under the rule of the so-called "People's Front" government? What have the Spanish people gained in this battlefield except for tragic deaths, insecure sleep, and the misfortune of losing their families? Why should we also make the same sacrifices?</p>
<p>5.  It is very clear that China today cannot break the reactionary forces of separatism unless it achieves true unification. With the daily approaching of the international crisis, the work of unification must be completed at an accelerated pace in order to cope with the current difficult situation. Political unification must have economic construction as its foundation in order to be long-lasting. Moreover, our country's backward production and undeveloped transportation have become modern countries, and it is also waiting for the development of construction undertakings. However, if the country does not have a unified political power to guarantee it, it will be difficult to carry out various constructions, or even be destroyed. Therefore, the unification of political power, on the other hand, is a prerequisite for economic construction. Not only resisting the enemy and defending ourselves depends on unification.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that in today's China, there is no way to strengthen the force of resisting the enemy without unification, and there is no way to achieve the results of construction without unification. In a word, only by completing unification can we save China. Therefore, with the arrival of the 26th year of the Republic of China, we dare to shout out the great slogan of "National Salvation Through Unification," hoping that all people in the country, regardless of their profession, can immediately rise up to assist and use the great power of the entire nation to carry out a general mobilization of national opinion, correct any distorted consciousness of any faction, and eliminate any separatist forces in the shortest possible time, regardless of whether they are warlords, traitors, or the Communist Party. We deeply believe that only a consolidated unification is the cornerstone of saving the country. We are willing to do our best to complete this great "National Salvation Through Unification" movement for the entire Chinese nation. January 9, 26th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<h3>University Presidents Telegraph Central Government to Curb the Shaanxi Rebellion</h3>
<p>Impose Severe Sanctions on Yang Hucheng</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that university presidents in this city, such as Weng Zhilong, believe that the central government's handling of the Shaanxi Incident is very appropriate. Although Zhang Xueliang has expressed remorse, Yang Hucheng is still attempting to resist the order and raise troops. Yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the central government, requesting that effective methods be adopted quickly to impose severe sanctions. The original telegram is as follows: To the Nanjing National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission: We humbly observe that the central government's handling of the Shaanxi Incident is based on the purpose of preserving national strength while rectifying discipline. Therefore, it is lenient to the masterminds. Zhang Xueliang has already surrendered himself with repentance, hoping for special grace. Yang Hucheng is also a principal, and his dismissal and retention is also an exception. All those who participated in this disaster should be grateful and try to repay. However, Yang Hucheng colluded with bandits and indulged in evil. Since the central government issued the order, his attitude has been ambiguous, and he has not shown any repentance. Recently, he has recklessly expanded the divisions and resisted the order to raise troops, destroying unification. Such harm to the country is truly an enemy of the people. We humbly request that effective methods be adopted quickly to impose severe sanctions to curb the rebellion and demonstrate the rule of law. It is most urgent. Shanghai University Presidents Weng Zhilong, Li Zhaohuan, He Bingsong, Chu Minyi, Hu Wenyyao, Gu Yuqi, Liu Haisu, Qian Yongming, Zhang Shouyong, Ou Yuanhuai, Guo Qiyuan, Chen Jicheng. Liu Zhanen, He Shizhen, Chen Mengyu, Cao Huiqun. respectfully kowtow.</p>
<h3>Cultural Circles Telegraph Central Government to Severely Punish Zhang Xueliang</h3>
<p>Swiftly Suppress the Rebels in Shaanxi and Gansu</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Cultural Circles Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Support Association and the Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Major Primary and Secondary Schools jointly telegraphed yesterday, and also telegraphed the central government to severely punish Zhang Xueliang, and to quickly suppress the rebels in Shaanxi and Gansu, to implement the national policy of internal pacification and external resistance, and unification to defend against insults. The text of the telegram is as follows: To all newspapers in the country, and forwarded to the party headquarters and governments of all provinces and cities, all schools, and all groups: A telegram was sent to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, and the Military Affairs Commission: The Xi'an Incident was insane and its culprits deserved death, as the people of the country all said. However, your association (government) (yuan) thought that Zhang Xueliang escorted Chairman Jiang back to Nanjing and pleaded guilty, and emphasized generosity and advocated peace. It reduced the sentence for the culprit, ordered a special pardon, and strictly supervised him, hoping that he would reform himself. It only ordered the accomplices to be dismissed and retained, and charged them with making meritorious service while bearing the crime. All this was intended to preserve national strength. Who knew that a wolf's ambition would never change. The person under supervision used his deceitful skills, roamed outside the law, and secretly made war, so that the soldiers of the Northeast Army, even if they wanted to obey the central government, could not move forward. In addition, Yang Hucheng occupied the northwest, colluded with bandits, and spread heresy recklessly, and his rebellious traces were obvious. In recent days, the deterioration of the situation in Shaanxi and Gansu and the suffering of the people in the northwest have been reported in newspapers, but it is less than one-hundredth of the truth. If our central government falls into his trick and insists on leniency, then nurturing a tumor will cause trouble, and it will be too late to bite the navel. In governing the army and administering the government, there must be discipline. It is appropriate to declare a punitive expedition for resisting orders and raising troops. It is appropriate to ask your association (government) (yuan) to make a decisive decision, enforce the law, and punish Zhang Xueliang, the culprit for losing the territory, by imposing capital punishment to appease the world. Then, lead the national army to sweep away the rebels, eliminate the bandits, and stabilize the people's livelihood. Those who have not gone far astray and come back should be recruited quickly, treated equally, and work together to make contributions to the country. Internal pacification is the way to resist external aggression, and unification is the way to defend against insults. The entire nation is willing to be the backing, alas, the red flames in the northwest are about to spread. The suppression of bandits on the border has been stopped halfway. Who is to blame for this? Who caused this? There is a saying that if you do not make a decisive decision, you will suffer from it. With the wisdom of your (government) (yuan), how can you not see this? In a moment of crisis, we hope that the whole country will unanimously appeal to uphold discipline and unify to defend against insults. This is the only way to rely on it. Shanghai Cultural Circles Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Support Association • Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Various Universities • Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Secondary Schools • Association of Secondary Schools • Joint Association of Faculty and Staff of Primary Schools respectfully kowtow,</p>

<h3>Municipal Security Team Party Department Sends Telegram to Officers and Soldiers of the Northeast Army</h3>
<p>The Party Affairs Guidance Committee of the Municipal Security Team sent another telegram to the officers and soldiers of the Northeast Army yesterday, saying: Commanders, officers, and soldiers of the Northeast Army in Shaanxi and Gansu, greetings. I have read with respect. The central government's various measures for handling military and political affairs in Shaanxi and Gansu this time are both disciplined and humane, and they are advancing simultaneously in suppressing bandits and resisting the enemy. It is particularly hopeful that they will cherish the national strength, stabilize local order, understand the hardships of the soldiers, and think of your past. All those who are bloody and ethical are happy and supportive. You have long been known for your loyalty to the government, and you have never been behind in protecting the party and the country. You should be sincere in implementing the central government's orders, set an example for your comrades, and support unification to comfort the people of the country. If you and Mr. Hucheng and Mr. Xiaohou are unwilling to accept such a lenient and comprehensive solution, it is a deliberate resistance to orders. In order to lay the foundation for saving the country and defending against insults, the national public opinion cannot but ask the government to impose severe sanctions on those who resist orders. The sanctions against resisting orders are by no means comparable to civil war. I hope that you will uphold the duty of soldiers to obey orders, have the determination to pull back from the brink, restore your reputation, and consolidate the foundation of the country. I hereby send a telegram to express my sincerity, hoping that you will understand. Shanghai Municipal Security Team Party Affairs Guidance Committee,</p>

<p>Inaugural Meeting Held, Directors and Supervisors Elected; Half of the 20 Million Yuan Capital Raised</p>
<p>With investment from the domestic financial community to construct the Chuanqian Railway, approved by the Ministry of Railways, the Chuanqian Railway Chartered Joint-Stock Company was established with a capital of 20 million yuan, half of which has already been raised. The Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government each invested 2.25 million yuan, and the company was legally established, with the head office located in Shanghai. It is decided that the Chengdu-Chongqing line will begin construction on the first of next month. Our Central News Agency reporter has obtained the following details:</p>
<p>Company Establishment</p>
<p>Sichuan Province possesses abundant resources, known as a land blessed by nature. Unfortunately, under the previous rule of warlords, it could not be developed, and transportation was especially inconvenient. After the establishment of the Sichuan Bureau years ago, various construction projects are being actively carried out, with the construction of railway transportation being particularly urgent. The China Construction Bank then initiated the construction of the Chuanqian Railway. After receiving approval from the Ministry of Railways, it immediately prepared to establish a company to undertake the project. The fixed capital amount is 20 million yuan, with an initial fundraising target of 10 million yuan. In addition to the Ministry of Railways and the Sichuan Provincial Government each subscribing 2.25 million yuan, the remaining 5.5 million yuan was raised in Shanghai. Recently, an inaugural meeting was held, at which directors and supervisors were elected, and the articles of association were approved. These have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and sent to the Central Political Council for record. The company's head office, located in Shanghai, has also begun operations, with three groups: General Affairs, Finance, and Technology, each responsible for their respective departments. However, the organizational charter is still awaiting approval from the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<p>Election of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>The company has 19 directors. In addition to the general manager who is a director by default, 11 directors are from commercial shareholders. At the inaugural meeting, Wang Lengbo, Hu Bijiang, Ye Zhuotang, Li Shizeng, Zhou Zuomin, Xu Xinliu, Song Zi'an, Liu Zhujun, Xu Ziqing, Jiang Kui, Yang J眉imei, and others were selected to serve. Seven directors are from government shares, with Zhang Gongquan, Deng Yiguang, and Zeng Yangfu appointed by the Ministry of Railways, and Liu Hangchen, Lu Zuofu, and Gan Jijiong appointed by the Sichuan Provincial Government. One person from the Ministry of Finance has not yet been assigned. Three supervisors were selected, with Wu Yunzhai selected from commercial shareholders, and Du Zhenyuan appointed by the Ministry of Railways and Deng Hanxiang appointed by the Sichuan Provincial Government. The board of directors has held two meetings and elected Zeng Yangfu, Li Shizeng, Song Zi'an, Lu Zuofu, and Liu Zhujun as standing directors. Zeng Yangfu was mutually elected as the chairman of the board, and the board of directors appointed Zeng to also serve as the general manager. Zeng came to Shanghai yesterday to provide instructions on company affairs.</p>
<p>Construction Plan</p>
<p>The railway operated by the company, approved by the Ministry of Railways, will first construct the trunk line from Chengdu to Chongqing, and then gradually expand to build the branch line from Neijiang to Zigong, and the main line from Chongqing to Guiyang. The operating period is 30 years. The Chengdu-Chongqing trunk line, since the establishment of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Engineering Bureau for its construction, has now been surveyed and will begin construction on the first of next month. The line is 522.436 kilometers long, and the estimated construction cost is approximately 60 million yuan. In addition to the company's capital of 20 million yuan, a loan of 34.5 million French francs has been obtained from French banking groups, and a contract has already been signed, and orders have been placed for steel rails, etc. from foreign countries. The sleepers used will primarily be domestically produced. The entire project is expected to be completed in two and a half years, and the line should be open to traffic by the summer of 1939.

<p>Declaration of Establishment</p>
<p>The inadequacy of accounting in our country has long been criticized by the world. It is recorded, "The feudal lords hated that it harmed them, so they all removed their registers." Concealing accounts and recording inaccurately is a great evil. However, without standardized systems or open methods, there is no way to verify the truth, and it is difficult to avoid errors and corruption. The impact can be small, leading to the demise of a business, or large, weakening a nation. Government accounting has gradually achieved unification and openness through the efforts of the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Audit. However, private enterprises still retain their old ways. In recent years, the collapse of businesses has become increasingly common, with numerous cases of corruption. This has become a hidden concern for society. As personnel become more complex and commerce and industry expand, the past tolerance of concealment and inaccuracy, where even shareholders could not thoroughly review the books, is no longer applicable today. When discussing economic undertakings today, it is necessary to have appropriate and open accounting systems to reveal the true state of finances to guide the direction of management, to safeguard the soundness of enterprises to prevent the occurrence of fraud, and to prove the accuracy of accounts to establish public trust. Recently, the government has started collecting income tax, and the calculation of profits for business enterprises must be based on accurate bookkeeping. In both law and fact, open accounting cannot be avoided. The developed economies of the West have greatly benefited from open accounting. Consider England, where the law stipulates that at least one of the company's supervisors must be an accountant. In the United States, various parties will not recognize financial reports unless they are certified by an accountant. Furthermore, accountants act as notaries, handling tax matters on behalf of both the government and the people, which is a common phenomenon in various countries. We, recognizing the necessity of building the national economy on a sound foundation, and aware that the accounting methods of most companies and firms in our country are still extremely rudimentary, the skills of accountants are still lagging behind, shareholders and creditors are often concerned about being deceived, and the government finds it difficult to verify tax collection, hereby initiate the organization of the Association for Promoting Open Accounting. We broadly gather comrades, mobilize entirely, and engage in the "Open Accounting Movement" based on accounting theory and practical experience. We will formulate simple and unified accounting systems, provide technical assistance to companies and firms nationwide as much as possible, study the laws and regulations of various countries that promote open accounting, actively make legislative suggestions to the government, and instill accounting knowledge to the general public, in order to jointly advance towards the grand path of open accounting and business progress. As the saying goes, "A people without trust cannot stand." It also says, "The world is for all." Open accounting is the way to establish public trust and promote social prosperity. We hold this goal firmly and persevere relentlessly. We hereby announce the reasons for organizing this association to the world. All enlightened comrades in our society, let us come together! We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>The Machine Industry Association Submits an Explanation of Salary Income Tax to the Government</h3>
<p>Different Systems for Monthly Wages and Piecework</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery-Made National Goods Factories United Association held a general meeting of all members at the New Asia Hotel on the afternoon of the 14th at 8:00 PM, with over 300 people in attendance. Lu Zhixue, Cai Shengbai, and Ji Jiannan were elected as the presidium. The chairman first reported on the association's affairs, followed by speeches by Pan Yangyao and others. Then, they discussed the proposal by the Sanyou Society regarding Article 5 of the Income Tax Regulations on salary income. According to the situation in Shanghai, it is extremely complex, with monthly wage systems, piecework systems, those who only receive salaries, those who receive food, lodging, and transportation expenses in addition to their salaries, those who provide food but not lodging, those who provide lodging but not food, and those who do not provide food or lodging. The question is whether the income tax should be based on the monthly salary income or include food, lodging, and transportation expenses. If so, whether those who provide food but not lodging, those who provide lodging but not food, and those who do not provide food or lodging can deduct their food or lodging expenses from their salaries before paying income tax. Because our company has thousands of employees, according to Item 3 of Article 17 of the detailed rules, employers are required to withhold the tax on their behalf, and the calculation of income tax is progressive, making it extremely difficult with numerous questions. The member factories of our association presumably share these concerns. Therefore, we are taking this opportunity of the delegates' meeting to raise this discussion to seek clarification, or each can submit their questions to the government for explanation, so that those who are obligated to pay and the employers who withhold the tax can have something to follow, and the competent authorities can collect the tax smoothly. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that each factory should collect their opinions and then submit them to the authorities for explanation. Finally, there was entertainment, with the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory performing Chinese martial arts and the Lan Society singing opera. The meeting ended happily at 10:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Gold Exchange Layoffs Opposed by All Staff</h3>
<p>Exchange Denies Reorganization Rumors</p>
<p>The Shanghai Gold Exchange, due to a sharp decline in operating income, recently planned to announce layoffs to save expenses and maintain the status quo. The 30th shareholders' meeting is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM on the 31st of this month to report to the shareholders. The exchange's general affairs, accounting, trading, and calculation departments, as well as the document section, have a total of 107 employees, with monthly salaries ranging from 15 to 60 yuan, excluding the heads of departments. It is now rumored that only 20 to 30 people will be retained. All the staff members are opposing the layoffs. They believe that the exchange's operations have been profitable in all years except for 1935, when it was break-even, and 1936, when it incurred losses. Its reserve fund has reached 550,000 yuan. Therefore, they have decided to wait for the board of directors to announce the list and officially announce the layoff plan before deciding on countermeasures. According to the person in charge of the board of directors of the Gold Exchange, who spoke to the New Voice News Agency, the exchange's business is declining, resulting in income not being able to offset expenses. Therefore, reducing staff is a method to save expenses. Retiring employees will be given six months' salary as severance pay, but there is no mention of reorganization.</p>
<h3>Li Zidong, Manager of the Xi'an Branch of the Bank of China, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Li Zidong, manager of the Xi'an branch of the Bank of China, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning to visit Song Hanzhang, general manager of the head office, to report on the situation of the branch during the Xi'an Incident.

<h3>Police Organs to be Changed to a Two-Tier System</h3>
<p>All Police Stations to Become Branches</p>
<p>Since the Municipal Police Bureau was ordered to change its name, all its branches and stations have also been renamed police branches and police stations. However, there have been no changes in the internal organization. However, due to the large population of the city, the bureau intends to change the existing three-tier system to a two-tier system for the convenience of command and the speed of action, that is, to abolish the police stations and establish them all as police branches. However, the issue of zoning is still under careful consideration, and detailed planning should be carried out for the density of the population and the size of the area. As for the reorganization of the security regiments into security police under the jurisdiction of the police bureau, inquiries with the authorities have revealed that there are no such plans.</p>
<h3>Relief Association Allocates 10,000 Yuan to Help Disaster Victims in Henan Province</h3>
<p>The Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charity Groups in this City received a telegram from the Henan Relief Committee yesterday, (details omitted): Telegram received, urgently requesting investigation and collection. Now in the severe winter, the disaster area is in urgent need of relief. Those who come to Bian to eat are in groups of thousands, and several die every day. Although the association has successively provided funds for repatriation, many are willing to die in Kaifeng rather than return to their hometowns. It is really overwhelming. Please quickly allocate a large sum of money and invite Master Dehao to personally distribute it. Greatly anticipating and praying, the Henan Relief Committee's cold weather telegram. After receiving the telegram, the association immediately allocated 10,000 yuan, remitted to Henan through the Bank of China for relief, and replied to the Henan Relief Committee, saying: Zhang Boying and Chang Zhizhen of the Henan Relief Committee, we previously telegraphed that after sufficient funds had been raised, Master Dehao would be invited to inspect and distribute the funds. Because Master Dehao resigned due to an incident and the relief funds were limited, we have specially remitted 10,000 yuan of relief funds raised to your province through the Bank of China, and sent 50 relief tickets from our association. We hope you will inspect and collect them and distribute them in accordance with the regulations. Once the distribution is completed, we hope you will create a register for reimbursement. Shanghai Joint Disaster Relief Association of Charity Groups.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Announces the Cancellation of Branch Offices</h3>
<p>Accounting Books Have Been Prepared and Sold; Communication Addresses Also Cancelled</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association issued a notice to all members yesterday, saying: ❶ In order to collect income tax, accounting books have been prepared and sold by the association for standardization. Regarding the income tax for self-employed professionals, which has been levied since January 1 of this year, all members should calculate the income tax payable based on the amount of income, deducting the deductible amounts, and pay it in full. Discrepancies in the accounts of income and expenditure will lead to disputes. Therefore, the association has assigned personnel to design and prepare two types of accounting books, namely the journal and the subsidiary ledger, which make it easy to record income and expenditure amounts and calculate the tax payable. Detailed instructions on how to record and deduct items in accordance with the Income Tax Regulations are attached to the front of the book for reference. Each type of accounting book has 50 pages and is bound in one volume, priced at 60 cents in national currency. They have been sold at the association at No. 30 Gao Naiyi Road, Shanghai, since January 16 of this year. Hereafter, all members using income and expenditure accounting books should purchase and use the aforementioned accounting books for standardization. Corresponding letter for compliance. ❷ Regarding the deadline for canceling branch offices or communication addresses, if they are found after the deadline, the court prosecutor's office should be reported for investigation. In the case of members Zhu Wende, Zhang Guangzong, Mao Jiaju, Tao Muxia, Yu Zhongluo, Zhou Xiao'an, Tang Youwei, and others proposing to notify members to close down branch offices and communication addresses, it has been found that the establishment of branch offices and communication addresses by members is detrimental to morality and has long been banned by the association. While some have complied, many have turned a deaf ear. If the old situation is allowed to continue, the association's resolution will be as good as a document, and the association's prestige will be reduced invisibly. At this time of repeated orders to rectify the lawyer's code of conduct, members' branch offices and communication addresses seem to need strict prohibition. It is specially co-signed to propose that all members with branch offices or communication addresses should close them down by the deadline in order to rectify the code of conduct. Is this appropriate? Awaiting public decision. Based on this, the association decided to inform all members that they should cancel branch offices and communication addresses by the deadline. If they still exist after the deadline, the court prosecutor's office will be reported for investigation. Corresponding letter for compliance. Please comply and cancel them within two weeks in order to rectify the code of conduct. If any are found to exist after the deadline, they will only be reported to the court prosecutor's office for investigation. Please do not violate this.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to the French Municipal Council to Negotiate National Medicine Donation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the French Concession Municipal Council yesterday, saying: On the 4th of this month, according to a letter from the National Medicine Industry Association in this city, the French Concession Municipal Council suddenly collected a donation for the Chinese medicinal materials and pharmaceutical sales regulations from the national medicine stores last summer, ranging from 25 yuan to 10 yuan per year, and the collection was urgent, causing public dissatisfaction. The industry in the entire district felt that this donation was not only illegal, but also during a time of commercial decline and difficult maintenance, they had no extra energy to bear this heavy burden. Therefore, they requested the association to argue on the basis of reason to achieve the goal of cancellation. The association sent two letters and sent representatives to negotiate, but they were not received and there was no reply. The Chinese Ratepayers Association in the French Concession once mediated, but it was too far away and had no effect, so it was delayed. At the end of the year and the beginning of the year, when business is busy, the bureau sent Chinese and foreign personnel to threaten to cut off water and electricity if they violated the rules, forcing the stores to pay by the deadline. The situation was fierce. Therefore, an emergency meeting was held on the 8th and 9th of this month and decided that if the French authorities insisted on suppressing them with barbaric means, the entire industry would take collective resistance actions when necessary. In addition to sending separate letters to the Municipal Council and reporting to the Municipal Party Department and the Bureau of Social Affairs, we are hereby reporting to your association, requesting you to urgently devise a way to stop it and maintain business. Based on this, the bureau recently collected donations for Chinese medicinal materials and pharmaceuticals. Our association has not determined whether it is appropriate because it does not know the detailed regulations. However, at a time when business is declining in the French Concession and when it is customary to close accounts, suddenly using the cutting off of water and electricity as a tool to force the donation may incite incidents. The bureau will gain nothing from this, and it will also have a significant impact on business order. In addition to advising the industry association to make reasonable requests and not take extreme measures, we are corresponding to the situation, requesting your bureau to quickly stop it, and hope to reply.</p>

<h3>Chen Qiucao's Painting Exhibition for Assisting Sui Concludes</h3>
<p>The famous painter Chen Qiucao, feeling the need to aid the Sui War, held a painting exhibition of more than 100 of his recent works at the gallery on the fourth floor of the Daxin Company on Nanjing Road from New Year's Day. He was willing to donate half of the proceeds from the sale of tickets and paintings to Sui. For a time, the audience was enthusiastic and highly praised. The painting exhibition ended on the 11th. It was found that 1,875 tickets were sold in nine days, equivalent to 187.5 yuan, and the actual receipt from the sale of paintings was 234.24 yuan, half of which totaled 210.87 yuan. It has been remitted in full. According to Chen's report, his feelings about this painting exhibition were that the audience's understanding of the meaning of his actions was not as important as he had imagined, and that most of the exhibits were works that expressed emotions and feelings, which slightly hindered the desire to sell paintings. Now that the results are like this, although it does not help much, it is already commendable. He deeply hopes that fellow artists will have a greater response and expression.</p>

<h3>Diphtheria Found in This City, Health Bureau Actively Preventing It</h3>
<p>Hunan Office Opens New Prevention and Treatment Room; Establishes Nutrition Department to Pay Attention to Citizens' Health</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau pays great attention to the health of citizens and public health facilities throughout the city. Now, the Hunan District Office of the Bureau has opened a new treatment room for the prevention of diphtheria, and established a nutrition department. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preventing Diphtheria</p>
<p>At a time when the climate is abnormal, diphtheria has been repeatedly found in this city. The office, recognizing that diphtheria is most easily spread, and if not prevented, will cause endless harm, has opened a new diphtheria prevention clinic. It is open every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. If citizens want to prevent the occurrence of diphtheria, they can go for examination within the specified time, free of charge. If, after examination by a doctor, it is believed that there is a possibility of contracting diphtheria, preventive injections will be given, also free of charge. The immunity of this injection lasts for about seven years.</p>
<p>Instructions for Preventing Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is the most terrible disease. According to the office's statistics, 1,091 people died from tuberculosis in 1936, more than any other disease. Second, 574 people died from typhoid fever. Other infectious diseases such as diphtheria (113 people) and smallpox (87 people) had lower mortality rates. The office is now cooperating with the Anti-Tuberculosis Association to set up an anti-tuberculosis clinic, which is open every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM, hosted by expert Dr. Chen Changxin. Currently, more than 30 people go for treatment each time. For those with mild illnesses, the doctor will provide instructions on various treatment methods. For those with serious illnesses, they will be transferred to sanatoriums for treatment. The office also has X-rays for perspective and photography of patients with lung diseases. (Perspective fee is 1 yuan, free for the poor; photography fee is 5 yuan.) It is completely free for examination and instructions on treatment methods. If lung disease is found in a family, the office can be notified, and a nurse will be sent to the home to provide instructions on prevention methods, also free of charge.</p>
<p>Establishing a Nutrition Department</p>
<p>In order to promote the health of citizens, the office has also stipulated that doctors will be assigned to conduct physical examinations for citizens every Saturday morning, with a fee of 1 yuan. Recognizing that children in the city are malnourished, resulting in weakness and deficiency, a nutrition department has been established. The detailed regulations will be announced soon. It is planned to start with school children and then extend to various agencies and groups. Citizens can send letters for inquiries.</p>
<h3>Widespread Severe Flu Among Japanese Residents</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Daily reports that the deadly influenza spreading across Europe and America has reached this city. Over the past few days, numerous cases have emerged. During the years 1918 and 1919, the virulent Spanish flu raged through Europe and America, causing numerous deaths. The cases in this city are comparatively milder. According to Dr. Ooi, director of the Japanese Civic Association Clinic, dozens of patients (Japanese only) have sought treatment in the past few days. He suspects the actual number of those infected must be much higher. Initial symptoms include inflammation of the throat, trachea, and bronchi, gradually affecting the gastrointestinal system, causing sudden vomiting and diarrhea, resembling typhoid fever. Some also experience discomfort in joints and muscles. Patients have very high temperatures lasting for extended periods. Currently, there are no effective preventative methods in scientific practice. It is hoped that everyone will pay special attention to hygiene.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan Kidnapping Case Solved, Ransom Returned</h3>
<p>A Group of People Escorted to Hangzhou</p>
<p>The kidnapping gang that was operating out of a tenement house at No. 26 Puqing Lane, Malan Road in the French Concession, was busted earlier this month by the Detective Division of the Municipal Police Department. The kidnapped boy, Sun Guantong, (11 years old), was rescued on the spot. Several male and female kidnappers were arrested in succession. During a search conducted in Xiaoshan, four Mauser pistols and over a hundred bullets were seized. They are being temporarily held at the police station. Special officers Jin Zimei and Wang Chuanzhong and squad leader Zhou Xiaochang, dispatched by the Xiaoshan County government where the incident occurred, arrived in Shanghai yesterday with six armed officers. They officially notified the Municipal Police Department to take custody of the criminals. The victim's mother, Sun Chen, accompanied them and reclaimed her beloved son. This morning, the group boarded the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to escort the criminals back to the Xiaoshan County government for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Conspiracy to Defraud Willie Watch Store, Police Prosecute Two on Multiple Charges</h3>
<p>Public Endangerment and Conspiracy to Commit Robbery - Suspects Questioned Yesterday, Further Hearings Pending</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, the Chinese Inspector of the Public Safety Bureau, Detectives Wang Chengying, Wang Jinsheng and others, previously arrested two bandits, Huang Hongsheng and Song Genfa, in Room 21 of the Liangxi Inn on Hubei Road. They confiscated a handgun, seven bullets, and a bomb. Upon interrogation, it was revealed that the gun was provided by Wang Caixi, the owner of the Longquan Teahouse at No. 1 Shangde Lane, Xinji Road. Wang was subsequently apprehended and handed over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide continued the hearing in the first criminal court, with Wang Caixi hiring lawyer Fan Gang for his defense. Lawyer Ru Baoyi, representing the police, stated that the confiscated bomb posed an imminent danger of explosion, and the police took emergency measures to hand it over to the water patrol police for destruction in the Huangpu River. The accused possessed the explosive device with the intention of robbing Willie Watch Store at No. 117 Nanjing Road, and were apprehended by the police while gathering accomplices. Therefore, they are being prosecuted under Articles 187 and 328 of the Criminal Code for public endangerment and conspiracy to commit robbery, and should be severely punished. Huang Hongsheng and Song Genfa confessed to the charges presented by Lawyer Ru. Song also stated that the handgun was supplied by Wang Caixi, but Wang firmly denied it, claiming that he had a feud with Song due to a fight, and was being falsely accused. He presented He Jianmin as proof that Song and Wang had indeed fought on May 5th of the previous year. Lawyer Ru of the police stated that Wang had been arrested by the police for a previous firearms offense, proving his inherent instability, and requested that the hearing be adjourned. Judge Feng, after reviewing the report, ordered that the hearing be adjourned for one week.</p>
<h3>The Continents of Europe and Asia Are Constantly Moving</h3>
<p>Director of Xujiahui Observatory Discusses With Western Reporters Yesterday - Claims to Have Measured One-Twentieth of the Earth's Surface</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News reports that Father Lejay, the director of the Xujiahui Observatory, member of the French Academy of Sciences, and Doctor of Science, returned to Shanghai a few days ago after being away for nearly two years. During this period, he attended various conferences and continued his research in Europe and Asia Minor. Yesterday (the 14th), when interviewed by a reporter from the North-China Daily News, he made an astonishing announcement regarding his gravity measurement work: "I have measured one-twentieth of the Earth's surface." The doctor stated that upon returning to Europe, he first attended the International Astronomical Union conference in Paris, where the issue of continental drift was discussed. Wegener's theory is particularly intriguing to the general public because it suggests that the eastern coast of South America and the western coast of Africa were once part of a larger continent that split apart, and that continents are constantly moving. For example, the Americas move westward by about one meter each year. A thorough investigation of this theory is estimated to take fifty years. When the doctor presented his theory, the scientific community was shaken. He based it on the precise records of star transits between Xujiahui and major European observatories, concluding that the continents of Europe and Asia are constantly moving. As a result, the distance between Paris and Shanghai differs by approximately 30 meters each month. The difference in longitude is determined by drawing a perpendicular line from the Earth's center to the location in question. There are three main theoretical reasons for this: ㊀ Atmospheric disturbances can cause the direction of stars to be deflected from their correct position when they pass through the vertical plane due to the refraction of starlight. ㊁ Objects inside the Earth can affect the perpendicular line drawn from the Earth's center, causing the Earth's center of gravity to shift due to the movement of these objects. ㊂ Due to crustal movement, the distance between two cities is constantly changing. The Xujiahui Observatory is still studying this issue. In September 1935, the doctor attended a leadership conference on meteorology in Warsaw, known as the "Conference of Directors." The main purpose of this conference was to organize a global meteorological center to contribute to the development of aviation. It is important to organize climate forecasting and climate condition reporting so that continents can be connected, which is a necessary factor for air travel. The doctor said, "We must take a leading position in aviation. The opening of the air route between the United States and Manila has made a great impression on the meteorological community and made it more important than ever to organize direct traffic, standardized codes, and observation times." The doctor also discussed gravity measurements, saying that he plans to first measure a large part of the upper-level Far East, French Syria, and part of Palestine. While he was in Syria, he was suddenly attacked by bandits one night, who stole all his money. Unexpectedly, a team of British police appeared in the darkness and drove the bandits away. Fortunately, the bandits did not touch the gravity measurement equipment. He has measured one-twentieth of the Earth's surface, establishing gravity measurement points every 50 to 100 kilometers. A renowned Dutch scientist has also conducted similar research underwater using submarines. They hope to measure the entire Earth in the next five to ten years with the help of other scientists in this field. This science can solve many problems concerning the size of the Earth, the internal composition of the Earth, and the Earth's balance. The doctor then took a notebook and a pencil, pointing out the location where he had discovered an earthquake, or the cause of an earthquake. The doctor said that at a certain distance under the Earth's crust, there is a point that can be called the equilibrium layer, where the pressure from above is almost equal. When there is a high mountain, its pressure will naturally increase, and the result is a kind of depression in this equilibrium layer to offset it. This is the norm, but when the equilibrium layer encounters a solid rock structure, it cannot form this offsetting depression. Therefore, this rock structure in a place where pressure is not constant, because it is overloaded, splits from time to time. The waves emitted from this split reach the ground and become an earthquake.</p>
<p>The doctor also studied the amount of ozone in the atmosphere. Two years ago, the Xujiahui Observatory discovered that the amount of ozone in the atmosphere in Shanghai is greater during anticyclones and smaller during low-pressure systems. This is the opposite of what has been discovered in Europe. What is the reason? The amount of ozone at the North Pole is several times that of the equator. The doctor's theory is that ozone moves with anticyclones. The ozone in Shanghai comes from Siberia and reaches the equator, while in Europe it comes from the Azores. When the doctor's theory was first published, it surprised scientists, who had long believed that the upper atmosphere was stationary and that changes in ozone were caused by changes in local solar radiation. Recently, Piccard and the National Geographic Society balloonists discovered strong winds blowing in the so-called stratosphere, which confirmed the doctor's theory. The doctor said that he intends to continue to study this point, because if the movements recorded in the stratosphere correspond accurately to those recorded in the lower atmosphere, the movements of the lower atmosphere can be predicted more accurately. He will also continue to study the amount of moisture absorbed in the air and try to solve the problem of determining the total amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. The reporter then asked the doctor to say a few words about the solar eclipse. The doctor said that the next solar eclipse in China will be in 1941, and a total eclipse will be visible in Fuzhou. At that time, famous astronomers from all over the world will come to China to observe the phenomenon. He will work with them to further this field of study.</p>
<h3>Hit-and-Run Truck Accident, Female Worker Crushed to Death</h3>
<p>Xiao Fengying's Body Examined Yesterday - Police Investigating the Fleeing Vehicle</p>
<p>Xiao Fengying, a 19-year-old woman from Taizhou, worked at the Dakang Yarn Factory in Pudong. Early the previous morning, around 6:00 AM, after completing her night shift, she and her fellow villager, Ding Zixiao, were returning to their factory dormitory to rest. As they were crossing Yangshupu Road, 100 yards east of Gelan Road, from south to north, a truck loaded with fishmongers sped eastward from the fish market. Due to its excessive speed, it was unable to avoid Xiao and knocked her to the ground, causing severe injuries. Although passersby witnessed the accident and shouted for the truck to stop, the driver ignored them and sped away. The license plate number could not be identified at the time. Later, someone reported the number as 948. The Chinese police summoned an ambulance to the scene and rushed the woman to Shengxin Hospital, but her injuries were too severe, and she died en route. The Yangshupu police were notified and ordered an investigation. The body was transported to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Tang, dispatched by the First Special District Court, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. Yuan Longsheng, Ding Zixiao, and others testified that they witnessed the car accident. Wang Sha, who provides meals at the Dakang dormitory, stated that she was from the same village as the deceased and has contacted her family. She requested temporary custody of the body. Mr. Tang approved the request, ruling that the deceased, Xiao Fengying, was a female who died from being crushed by a truck before her death. The body was handed over to Wang Sha for burial, and the relevant police department should continue to investigate the fleeing vehicle and handle the case accordingly.</p>
<h3>Child Bride's Lover Accuses Father-in-Law of False Accusation</h3>
<p>Bound with Ropes and Forced to Write a Note - Chen A'quan Files a Complaint with the Police Station</p>
<p>Yesterday, Chen A'quan, a 22-year-old man from Shaoxing who resides at No. 845, Shengxing Lane, Yongxing Road, Zhabei, and owns the Quanchang Hardware Factory, filed a complaint with the Xin Zha Branch, stating that he was falsely accused of adultery and defrauded of money, requesting the authorities to arrest the culprit and prosecute him according to the law. Chen stated that he had been running a factory in Zhabei for several years. On the afternoon of the 9th of this month, at around 11:00 PM, Jiang Huaidang, an unemployed rogue residing at No. 10 in the same lane, invited him to his house for a New Year's Eve dinner. They first plied him with alcohol until he was drunk, and then invited people to tie him up with ropes, falsely accusing him of having an affair with his child bride. They took 74 yuan in legal tender from his wallet and forced him to write three promissory notes. Chen stated that he was unable to resist, so he earnestly requested the police to arrest the defendants and prosecute them according to the law. After reviewing the report, the bureau immediately ordered Qian Tianxiong, the captain of the Sixth Division of the Detective Brigade, to dispatch squad leader Liu Bingyuan and detectives Wu Songshan and Miao Yizhong to Shengxing Lane, Yongxing Road, to arrest Jiang Huaidang. However, Jiang had already fled out of guilt. Only Jiang's wife, Ms. Yi, and child bride, Jiang Xiaomei, were brought to the station. According to Ms. Yi, 33 years old, from Zhenjiang, Chen A'quan calls me "auntie," but it's not a formal arrangement. However, he often comes to my house to play, and I didn't know they had an improper relationship. On the night of the 9th of this month, I heard footsteps upstairs. I called my husband (Jiang Huaidang) to investigate and called Wang Xiaoqing and Wang Zaiqing to tie A'quan up with ropes and put him on the floor. I asked him what he was going to do, and A'quan said he was willing to compensate. Later, they found someone to write three promissory notes, one for 20 yuan, one for 30 yuan, and one for 50 yuan. These three promissory notes have already been torn up. There is also a red one with Chen A'quan's fingerprint on it. When they were tied up, Lian Xiaomei was also tied up together, and she wasn't wearing any clothes. As for the wallet, it did exist, I heard them say there was ten yuan, but they returned it to him at the time. I heard that the person who wrote the notes was given one yuan. Jiang Xiaomei, 15 years old, from Chongming, said that that night I went out to soak my feet, and Chen A'quan followed me upstairs. I had an affair with him four or five times between June, July, August, and September of last year. This time, they tied us together with hemp ropes. Asking someone to write the note was done downstairs, I didn't know about it. Wang Xiaoqing, also admitted that Jiang's sister-in-law asked me to help write the paper. I saw three white ones and one red one, but I didn't get any reward from them. They said they would thank me in a few days. The team believes that the case involves serious charges of false accusation and fraud, so they need to summon additional witnesses for verification.</p>
<h3>Fishmonger Truck Accident Driver Sentenced</h3>
<p>Two Years Imprisonment</p>
<p>Yang Yuding from Xuzhou, on the 8th of this month, at one o'clock in the morning, was driving a No. 17119 truck, loaded with thirty fishmongers, to the fish market. While passing through Yangshupu Road, Qiupu Road, he carelessly swerved to avoid Li Yuanhao's bicycle. The front of the truck struck a large tree on the side of the road, causing the entire truck to overturn. This resulted in injuries to the fishmongers on board, including Shao Heshang, and also caused Li Yuanhao to suffer a fatal head injury. The police filed charges against Yang for negligent injury at the First Special Court. Details were previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, this case was continued to be heard in the Fifth Criminal Court by Judge Ye Shengchao. Because Li Yuanhao died from his injuries, Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police separately charged him with the crime of causing death through professional negligence under Article 276, Section 2 of the Criminal Code. Witnesses Yuan Dongcai and Yang Heqing testified that Yang was driving at a speed of 30 yards at the time. When questioned, Yang Yuding said that he had already avoided Li's bicycle, but he did not know how Li hit the back of his truck. Judge Ye, after reviewing the evidence, sentenced Yang Yuding to two years of imprisonment for causing death through professional negligence.</p>
<h3>Robbery at a Nunnery</h3>
<p>Losses Exceed 2,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Xiahai Temple on Donghaimao Road in Pudong is a nunnery with over twenty nuns. They usually rely on offerings from prayers and incense, which are sufficient. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 AM yesterday morning, it was targeted by robbers. Three of the robbers were armed with guns, while two were unarmed. They spoke with a northern accent and wore varying styles of long and short gowns. At the time, all the nuns were asleep, so they did not notice the robbers entering the temple. By the time they woke up, they were no longer free. All twenty-plus nuns in the temple were bound by the robbers, with one robber guarding them with a gun while the remaining robbers searched and looted. After about an hour, they fled with their loot. The nuns struggled to untie themselves and regain their freedom. After inspecting their losses, they found that over 2,000 yuan had been stolen. They immediately reported the incident to the relevant police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Detective Team Successfully Captures Extortionists</h3>
<p>Wang Lin Reports to Police Officer, Zhang Juchun and Five Others Arrested</p>
<p>Liu Huai, the team leader of the Municipal Police Detective Team, recently received a report from Wang Lin, a woman from Ningbo who runs a bone shop on Fuyou Road. She stated that between the 5th and 8th of this month, she received threatening letters demanding money. The initial demand was for 800 yuan, which was later increased to 2,000 yuan. The letters instructed her to deliver the money to Room 307 of the Zhonghui Building at the Big Clock Tower. Upon receiving the report, the team ordered the leader of the Third Team, Shan Bin, and detective squad leaders Wu Xiufeng, Gao Jinsheng, and Lu Daquan to investigate. They disguised themselves and secretly went to the specified location to meet with the extortionists. The extortionists were unsuspecting, and after negotiations, the amount was reduced to 2,000 yuan. The officers, together with the relevant police station detectives, lay in wait. At around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Wang Lin went to deliver the money, and Zhang Juchun, Ding Quanbo, Bao Funian, and three other men arrived to collect the money. They were all arrested and taken in for questioning. They confessed that they had accomplices. Yesterday morning, another suspect, Li Binyao, was arrested at No. 4 Yuqing Lane, Xietu Road, and taken back to the station for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Two Lawyers Released from Responsibility After Shi Liang Surrenders</h3>
<p>Court Decides Not to Prosecute - Bail Money to Be Returned</p>
<p>After female lawyer Shi Liang was arrested for political activities along with Shen Junru and others, the Third Branch of the High Court ordered lawyers Zhang Zhirang and Tang Hao to bail her out. She then left Shanghai and failed to appear in court. The Procuratorate of the Third Branch of the High Court transferred the case to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court. Chief Prosecutor Sun Shaokang summoned lawyers Zhang and Tang to the court and ordered them to each pay 500 yuan in cash as bail, setting a deadline for them to hand over Shi Liang to the court. Later, because they could not find her to hand over the case, Shi Liang wrote a personal letter to Zhang and Tang, requesting them to hand over the case. Due to her suffering from hemoptysis, she applied for an extension. However, Shi still failed to appear after the extension expired. The Procuratorate of the Second Special Court intended to investigate and prosecute the two guarantors, but Shi directly surrendered to the Jiangsu High Court in Suzhou and was detained for interrogation. Later, the Jiangsu High Court notified the Second Branch of the High Court to inform the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court that Shi had surrendered. After learning that Shi had indeed surrendered, Zhang and Tang also filed a request with the First Special Court Procuratorate to be released from their bail obligations. It is now reported that the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court has decided not to prosecute lawyers Zhang Zhirang and Tang Hao. The written decision has been delivered by the police, and the bail money paid by Zhang and Tang has been approved for return.</p>
<h3>Formal Husband and Wife Cannot File Private Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Ba Ruibao Sues Ye Shenglin - Case Not Accepted After Investigation</p>
<p>Ye Shenglin, a 27-year-old man from Taicang, previously hired lawyer Li Zhongwen to file a complaint with the Second Special Court against Tang Jinfu, the owner of the Jinjiantou store at No. 149 Xinqiao Street, for inducing a married woman to leave her family. The reason for the lawsuit was that Ye's wife, Ba Ruibao, had married Ye at the age of seventeen and lived with him for three years, giving birth to a son. Later, Ba suddenly absconded with valuables and disappeared without a trace. Although Ye searched everywhere, he could not find her. Ye has now learned that his wife, Ba Ruibao, was induced by Tang Jinfu, the owner of the Jinjiantou store, and introduced to Zhou Zhaozhang, the owner of the Jincheng Milk Shed in Shanghai, to be his concubine. Therefore, he is suing. However, before this case could be heard, Ba Ruibao also hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the First Special Court's criminal division against Ye Shenglin for obstruction of freedom and attempted fraud, stating that Ba was betrothed to Ye at the age of seventeen by her mother. However, Ye neglected his duties. When Ba came of age, he denied the marriage contract. Therefore, Ba went out to work as a domestic servant to make a living in 1935. On December 5th of last year, Ye colluded with Tang Jinfu, the owner of the Jinjiantou store, under the pretext of a conversation, and took the opportunity to detain Ba at the Xin Zha police station. After inquiring and learning that it was a marriage dispute, the police refused to accept the case. Ye then took Ba to Room 4 of the Hongxiang Hotel in Chengqiao, Beihu, and detained her overnight, depriving her of her freedom and demanding 600 yuan. It was not until the next day that she managed to escape. He committed Article 302 of the Criminal Code. Previously, when the Second Special Court summoned Ye Shenglin to hear his lawsuit against Tang Jinfu, they learned that Ba Ruibao had filed a separate lawsuit in the First Special Court. Therefore, they ordered the hearing to be postponed until the First Special Court case was concluded. Yesterday afternoon, the First Special Court heard Ba Ruibao's lawsuit against Ye Shenglin for obstruction of freedom. Ba initially denied that she had lived with Ye or had a child. However, because the facts were undeniable, she admitted that she had lived with Ye and had a son. However, the son had long since been given to someone else. When questioned, Ye Shenglin said that Ba Ruibao was his wife, they had been married for a long time, and the son born to them was still being raised by him. Finally, lawyer Li Zhongwen, the defense lawyer for the defendant Ye Shenglin, stated that since the plaintiffs and defendants are formally married, a private lawsuit cannot be filed according to the law and should be dismissed. After the two lawyers debated the procedure, Judge Ji ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>
<h3>Central Savings Society Lottery Drawing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Special Prize: 13132 - Won Exclusively by Wang Anji of Shanghai</p>

Zhou Qian, Li Zhen, Feng Yulun, Zhang Qinye, and others were selected as representatives of the depositors to go on stage to supervise the lottery drawing and inspect the lottery balls. Because the society's business has grown rapidly, and the number of numbers has increased significantly, the original copper balls were too small. Therefore, special large-sized lottery balls were cast, which were one-half larger than the balls used before. A leaf plate was added inside the balls to mix the number beads during the drawing. Because this period is January, the society prepared exquisite monthly calendars and distributed them to depositors and guests. At that time, the winning numbers were reported loudly in Mandarin by the announcer and recorded on the blackboard. The special prize, number 13132, was reportedly won exclusively by Wang Anji, the owner of a Shanghai bank, for 25,000 yuan. Winning depositors can bring their passbook and the payment receipt for this month to the society to collect their winnings immediately.</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Flour and Wheat Plunge, Actual Sales Stagnate, Bulls Panic, Final Estimates of Australian Wheat Released</p>
<p>In the flour market, quotations for foreign wheat fell by 245 jiao or more in Chicago and by 34 jiao or so in Canada. After the opening price was set, actual sales in the domestic market were either high or inconvenient for handling due to the continuous weakness of foreign wheat. As this month is approaching the delivery date, off-market bulls have no choice but to close out their positions. Therefore, the opening price has been continuously weak, falling by an average of 23 fen compared to the previous day. By the afternoon opening, the market had plunged again. Off-market bulls, seeing that actual sales were not active and could not be suppressed any longer, actively sold off positions for this month and February. Other customers, due to settlement reasons, were unable to absorb the selling pressure, and March and April also fell sharply due to their proximity. In the end, all contracts fell by 678 fen or more. Judging from the current situation, the bulls cannot exert their influence without the support of actual sales, so the subsequent situation is likely to be forced to decline further. It is estimated that trading volume today reached 8.92 million bags due to the sharp decline.</p>
<p>The wheat market remained quiet and ultimately showed a soft trend, with a sharp decline in the afternoon. At the opening price, both January and February saw short selling and no trading. Although there was some trading in March, there was no inflow or outflow. In April and June, sentiment was soft and weak, falling slightly by 34 fen. By the afternoon opening, market sentiment suddenly became unstable. Due to the major changes in the flour market and the collapse of the bulls, wheat market sentiment was also dimmed and lifeless, and the bulls were actively selling off, with the decline reaching about 1 jiao. Compared to the initial price this year, this month's contract has fallen by 2 jiao 9 fen, February by 3 jiao 6 fen, March by 3 jiao 9 fen, and April by 4 jiao 1 fen. This shows that the reaction after the overvaluation is also quite remarkable. The wheat market remains quiet, with only sporadic transactions and few large-scale sell-offs. Factories are only handling a few hundred bags, with prices down slightly by 35 fen.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 14th: Chicago wheat prices fell by 8.75 to 1.275 due to soft foreign markets and excessive long liquidations.</p>
<p>Also on the same day, Reuters, London: The final official estimate of Australian wheat and planting area was released as follows:</p>
<p>Early Indica Rice Arrives in Large Quantities, Sales Are Also Brisk</p>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of early indica rice continued to be strong, with another 340,000 bags arriving in the past two days. As inventories gradually increase, sentiment is generally soft, and the market has shown signs of stabilizing. However, yesterday, the trading of early rice turned active, and brokers from Shantou had strong demand, with about 3,000 bags traded. Brokers from Guangdong also handled about 2,000 bags of machine-milled rice. The local market also became active, and speculators were also making inquiries. As a result, trading turned brisk, and the market was able to hold its ground. The total volume of Gan rice opened for trading throughout the day was more than 6,000 bags, Xiang rice 1,200 bags, Han brown rice 417 bags, Wenzhou indica rice 2,000 bags, and small-grain rice 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>River Rice Prices Show Little Fluctuation</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total supply from various sources reached over 60 providers, with approximately 12,7800 dan of goods, including more than 10 providers of thin rice. The local market was slightly active because the end of the month had passed, and brokers from Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places bought nearly 3,000 bags of thin rice. Therefore, although the market is stable, the situation has become firm. Thick and thin japonica rice, as well as Du Yangjian and Yin Bianyuan rice, showed no signs of distress.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 45 or 46 providers of river rice from various sources. The sales volume in the local market remained normal. Those who skillfully handled white japonica rice had some transactions, and the market was stable. Those who wanted to sell lowered prices by a few fen. The prices of top-quality thin rice were stable, while medium and lower qualities showed a weak trend. Early rice was flat and weak, white yuan rice was soft and weak, and other indica rice and other goods showed little fluctuation.</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Grain Shipped to Southern Guangdong</p>
<p>Three-Star Yarn Plunges 12-13 Yuan, Golden Rooster February Contract Alone Rises by 1 Yuan, Near-Term Rises While Far-Term Falls, Again Showing Inverted Structure</p>
<p>Due to the abundant harvests in the inland regions this year, the amount of grain coming to Shanghai from the Yangtze River is congested. Sales to both the northern and southern trading groups are very good. In the northern regions, more than 1 million bags of flour and more than 600,000 bags of rice and beans have been shipped from Shanghai in the past three months. In recent two weeks it has been a bit stagnant and exports have gradually decreased. It is reported that the price in the north is lower than that in Shanghai, and because warehouses are full, brokers from Shantou and Guangdong have been actively purchasing in recent days. Two ships, the Haili and Guangzhou, transported about 18,000 bags of rice and beans to Guangdong the day before yesterday. Three ships, the Haiyuan, Dali South, and Guangdong, that are exporting today are transporting 17,000 bags of flour and 16,000 bags of rice and beans to Shantou, and 11,500 bags of flour and 21,400 bags of rice and beans to Guangdong.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Recent Yarn Prices Diverge from Three-Star Goods, Three-Star Goods Plunge 12-13 Yuan, Golden Rooster February Contract Alone Rises by 1 Yuan, Near-Term Rises While Far-Term Falls, Again Showing Inverted Structure</p>
<p>The yarn market rose ten times in the morning, but the recent market trend has been unusually firm. It is rumored that a consortium of bull companies is organized, buying up the February contract, preparing to take delivery of the goods. It is also said that an Indian merchant, Qiao Zhifu, has bought a large amount. It is found that a certain company has bought a huge amount of the February contract alone and has also hedged a lot of the March and April contracts. Therefore, although the three-star yarn market has repeatedly declined, the near-term contract has not been affected, while the far-term contract has become weak. Trading in the current yarn market is unusually sluggish. Three-star yarn has fallen sharply compared to the previous day, by 8.20 to 13.40 yuan.</p>
<p>Large Buyers in the February Contract</p>
<p>At the opening of the trading in standard yarn on the former day, each month showed a decline. Because the three-star yarn, which had been soaring continuously, had reacted and was continuously declining, dealers tended to sell. However, the market was not significantly affected, and prices tended to rise. The trading floor was still tight. This was actually because two firms, Mian Chang and Geng Feng, were absorbing large amounts in the February contract and releasing the March and April contracts. It is rumored that the purchase has already reached 12,000 bags, but the amount hedged in the far-term contract is also large. Trading in current yarn remains sluggish. The result of the trading in standard yarn was a rise of 1.46 yuan in the near-term contract and a rise or fall of 1.3 yuan in the far-term contract. At the afternoon opening, the decline in three-star yarn gradually restrained the people's sentiments. At the same time, the trading of current yarn declined, and floating longs liquidated, resulting in the market being suppressed again. The result was that each month's closing price fell by 5, 7, 8 jiao to 1 yuan compared to the morning closing price. The following are the firms that sold out: Hengyi 600 bags, Jinchang 1,350 bags, Taixing 1,150 bags, Gengfeng 2,200 bags, Senkang 1,050 bags, Renfeng 800 bags, Changfeng 3,300 bags, Hexing 1,000 bags, Yongda 500 bags, and Tonghe 500 bags. The following are the firms that bought in: Yudai 950 bags, Mingde 700 bags, Shenji 900 bags, Dachangcheng 3,300 bags, Runkang 1,150 bags, Xiecheng 800 bags, Xincheng 500 bags, Changji 650 bags, Xingchang 650 bags, Juxing 400 bags, and Yichang 400 bags. The highest and lowest prices for each month during the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Thread Prices Rise Alone by One Yuan</p>
<p>The trading of current yarn is mediocre. The total number of bags purchased by various groups throughout the day was 576, and the selling price was flat. Thread prices rose by 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of various groups are listed below.</p>
<p>Cotton Prices Do Not Fluctuate Greatly, and Market Trading Is Also Quiet</p>
<p>The cotton market has not been prosperous or damaged and still does not escape the consolidation situation. The situation is tired and sluggish. In addition, the overseas Indian and American cotton markets are also hovering, and the people's hearts are even more uninterested. However, the ratio of yarn to cotton is too far apart, and some try to tighten it, and they do not give up.</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Only Falls by One Jiao</p>
<p>The trend at the opening of trading of standard cotton on the former day was unusually flat. The market overseas showed no sign of vitality, and market trading became increasingly sparse. Therefore, there was absolutely no excitement. However, some people were optimistic because the prices in various producing areas were difficult to loosen. The result was that each month's closing price rose by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half compared to the previous day's closing price. At the afternoon opening, prices of far-term three-star cotton plummeted, and the market was hit again. Near-term prices broke the 4 yuan to 5 yuan mark. However, trading in the trading floor was very quiet, with little fluctuation. The result was that each month's closing price fell by 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half compared to the morning closing price. The following are the firms that sold out: Changfeng 3,000 dan, Zhenda 800 dan, Tongji 900 dan, Dachangcheng 1,200 dan, Taichang 1,600 dan, Tonghe 900 dan, Xinchang 1,200 dan, Ruiyuan 1,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 800 dan, and Taixing 1,600 dan. The following are the firms that bought in: Jifeng 1,100 dan, Hengyi 2,600 dan, Yudai 3,000 dan, Zhenda 800 dan, Hexing 900 dan, Yichang 1,300 dan, Changhe 1,700 dan, and Wangtaixing 1,000 dan. The highest and lowest prices for each month during the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Mills Constantly Need Current Cotton</p>
<p>Consumption of current cotton is still considered high, and cotton mills constantly need it. The supply that arrived includes 2,018 bales of Yao cotton and 1,360 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>American Cotton Is Still Under the Fear of the Government Selling Off Stored Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with each month falling 4 points or rising 2 points. At the beginning of the morning, foreign firms bought in, and news from Liverpool was good, and domestic consumption increased. Unfortunately, floating longs liquidated, especially in March. At the same time, longs in the March contract also rolled over to the far-term contract. The cotton market under the month is still under the force of panic caused by the government's sale of stored cotton. There are very few new purchases. Although peers are good buyers, their demand for the March contract is not as eager as before. One delivery notice for the January contract was issued, and the closing was firm. It is estimated that spot prices fell 5 points, and futures fell 5 points to rise 2 points. English cotton spot prices fell 1 point, and futures rose 12 points. Indian cotton speculators sold out and longs liquidated, but local factories absorbed large quantities because cloth was firm and expensive. It is estimated that Pinguoer fell 0.25 to 0.75 rupees, Aomula fell 1 to 1.25 rupees, and Bairuoxi fell 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 14th).</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram, the opening forecast for the 15th is: Bairuoxi 229.5 rupees, Aomula 206.5 rupees, both down 0.75 rupees, and Pinguoer 183.75 rupees, down 0.5 rupees.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 14th: The Macaleth Silver Company reported this week that India is continuing to sell, and it is rumored that the US government feels uncomfortable with the continued silver purchase plan, so the selling wind is even stronger.

A large number of previously purchased silver from India was loaded out this week, with London stocks of approximately 3 million ounces.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bond Market Still Lacks Vigorous Atmosphere</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the government bond market remained sluggish. Price fluctuations were minimal. Due to the chaotic situation, investor confidence continued to waver. The forces of buyers and sellers remained locked in a stalemate. Retail investors were mostly day traders, buying and selling in equal measure, which stabilized the market. Although there was a sense of underlying potential for upward movement, a truly vigorous atmosphere was still lacking. Yesterday morning, the opening atmosphere was relatively firm and trading was somewhat active. Issues like 327, 38, and 6 all saw some day trading. Issues 43 and 35 saw considerable buying. Market prices rose by 1-2 cents. Category A bonds for the current month rose slightly by one cent. In the second session, buying and selling activity remained strong, and the upward trend continued. Issue 43 continued to see strong buying, while issues 77 and 44 saw significant selling. Category A bonds for the next month rose by about another cent. The rest remained the same as in the first session. By the afternoon opening, the market became quiet again, and trading volume decreased. Issues 45 and 50 saw more selling. Category D and A bonds for the current month fell by 1-2 cents. Category C and B bonds rose by 5/10 of a cent. At the close, investor sentiment was tired, and retail investors gradually offered up their holdings. Market prices unanimously fell by 5/10 of a cent. Overall, the results for the day were slightly higher, rising 5/10 of a cent to 1.5 cents, while Category A bonds for the current month fell by 1.5 cents. The total trading volume was 5.94 million yuan. A comparative table of price increases and decreases, highs and lows, is shown below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>Imported Sugar Rises Again by 2-3 Cents</p>
<p>Over 2,000 Bags of Domestically Produced Light and Dark Brown Sugar Released</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was tight again. The guild set the prices for No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar spot at 23 yuan and 3 cents, up 3 cents.

<p>United States to Collect Sugar Processing Tax</p>
<p>Secretary of Agriculture Plans to Levy One Cent Per Pound</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 14th – Secretary of Agriculture Wallace plans to levy a sugar processing tax of one cent per pound, which would increase national tax revenue by $125 million. He stated that if Congress does not pass his proposed quota plan, it will be destroyed, resulting in chaos for the sugar refining industries in the United States, Cuba, and American colonies. Some believe that this action by the Secretary of Agriculture is a precursor to levying processing taxes on all agricultural products, which were already included in the original Agricultural Adjustment Act. Many believe that levying a processing tax will be deemed constitutional.</p>
<p>Also, from London: Sugar prices are very tight in the near term due to short covering. The March contract opened at 6 shillings and 6 pence, up 3 pence. May was at 6 shillings and 4.5 pence, up 1 pence and 7.5. August was at 6 shillings and 4.75 pence, up 1 pence.</p>
<h3>Metals</h3>
<p>Tinplate Prices Rise in China and Abroad</p>
<p>The annual sales of tinplate reach 200,000 boxes. Local factories use more, while foreign businesses use less. The largest source is the United States, followed by Italy, Germany, France, and England. The quality of materials is best from the United States, and worst from England and France. Currently, the most prevalent on the market are American and Italian products, followed by German and English products. French products have already disappeared from the market. The market conditions for each product are described below:</p>
<p>(American Products) The most recently circulating products on the market include 90-pound single-sheet (14 inches by 20 inches), double-sheet (20 inches by 28 inches), and 100-pound single-sheet and double-sheet. Transactions are few due to the extremely high prices, but prices are skyrocketing. For example, 90-pound double-sheet is priced at 10 gold yuan, and 100-pound is priced at 11 gold yuan and 10 cents (single-sheet prices are half). It is reported that fellow traders have made forward purchases of 4,000 boxes, while our street only sold a little over 100 boxes yesterday.</p>
<p>(Italian Products) The quality of this product is good, so actual transactions are very active. The only circulating product on the market is 180-pound, priced at 41 yuan, up one yuan from before. The overseas price is currently 42 shillings (90-pound double-sheet), while 100-pound double-sheet is priced at 43 shillings. It is reported that fellow traders have purchased over 4,000 boxes, reportedly purchased by metal shops along North Suzhou Road and Xin Kai River.</p>
<p>(German Products) The only circulating product on the market is also 90-pound double-sheet. There are only a few 100-pound double-sheets in stock, so there is no large market. The price of 90-pound double-sheet is 40 yuan and 5 cents, and 100-pound is 43 yuan. It is reported that transactions are slightly slower than Italian products, and the prices are similar to Italian products. Very few fellow traders have purchased them.</p>
<p>(English Products) In the past four or five years, this product dominated the tinplate market. Later, due to the lower quality, it was eliminated by Italian and German products. The amount of arrivals has also decreased. The only circulating products on the market are 90-pound and 100-pound single-sheet. Double-sheet has not been in stock for a long time. The price of 90-pound is 10 yuan and 5 cents, and 100-pound is 22 yuan. It is reported that foreign businesses still have some business, but our street has not heard of any sales. The overseas price is 20 shillings for 90-pound and 21 shillings for 100-pound, also up one shilling from before.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Japanese and American Silk Prices Drop Suddenly, Shanghai Silk Trading Slightly Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday, overseas silk markets showed mixed trends. Silk merchants' asking prices continued to rise, while exchange sales showed a reactionary situation. The New York Stock Exchange's standard silk for the near term fell by a significant 8.5 points yesterday, and the long term also fell by 6.5 points. In the Yokohama silk market, spot prices fell by 35 yuan, and forward prices fell by 21 yuan. However, the holding price of Japanese silk 83 degrees in New York rose by 2 points compared to the previous day, and 75 degrees rose by 3 points. Shanghai silk and Guangdong silk each rose by 4 points. In the Lyon silk market, except for Japanese silk, which fell by 0.25 francs, the prices of other silks remained the same as the previous market. Yesterday, the local silk market in Shanghai was influenced by the sudden drop in Japanese and American silk prices, so only high-grade white filature silk saw some trading. Sales of B-grade silk were slightly hindered, but investor sentiment remained optimistic. Printed Douppion silk and Sichuan factory silk continued to be sold. User silk market also remained firmly stable. 137 bales were sold yesterday.</p>
<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>Shanghai Price Index Reaches Highest Level Since 1932 in December 1936</p>
<p>According to the report of the National Tariff Commission, the wholesale, export, and import price indices and the Shanghai cost of living index all rose sharply in December 1936 compared to the previous month. The monthly percentage changes in the annual indices, except for the initial implementation of the legal tender in November 1935, when the value of the currency decreased and various indices once rose sharply by 5% to 15%, usually changed by no more than 3%. This month, the export index rose sharply by 6%, and the wholesale index also rose by more than 5%, a very strong increase. Moreover, the beginning of this upward trend was already seen last month, and it continued to increase this month, so the index reached its highest level since 1932. In terms of classified indices, except for a slight drop in wholesale chemicals and stable rent and miscellaneous expenses in the cost of living, all other categories increased, indicating the universality of this price increase. In terms of individual items, the price increases of major items such as metals, coal, oil, cake, cotton yarn, wheat, flour, cotton cloth, and miscellaneous grains were particularly large. Comparing the 15th of this month with the same day last month, metals rose by 2% to 33%, coal by 11% to 30%, oil and cake by 6% to 21%, cotton yarn by 8% to 20%, wheat by 13% to 18%, flour by 16%, cotton cloth by 5% to 14%, and miscellaneous grains by 2% to 12%. This is why the wholesale indices for metals, grains, fuel, and textiles rose sharply by 4.9% to 9.8%, the export and import indices for agricultural and mineral products, raw materials, and manufactured goods rose by 4.1% to 12.6%, and the cost of living indices for clothing and food rose by 3.1% to 6.0%. As for the reasons for this surge in prices, they are extremely complex. One possible explanation is that the overseas market prices of international commodities such as wheat and metals rose sharply. Secondly, due to years of economic recession, production has decreased, and there are few inventories. This year's agricultural harvest was abundant, and the purchasing power of people in the interior has slightly recovered. The market for daily necessities has become more active, and supply cannot meet demand. Thirdly, the Xi'an Incident on the 12th of this month was fortunately resolved quickly. At the time, people were quite nervous, and the futures trading of miscellaneous rice, yarn, and cloth showed a tendency to jump and rise sharply, which raised spot prices.</p>
<p>㊀ The general index of wholesale prices was 118.8, an increase of 5.1% compared to the previous month and 15.0% compared to the same month last year, the highest level since February 1932. Comparing the various indices with the previous month, except for a slight drop in chemicals, all other categories rose sharply, especially metals, grains, fuel, and textiles. The remaining three categories also increased significantly. The metal index rose by 9.8%. Due to rising external market prices, strong domestic sales, and a perceived shortage of spot goods, most prices rose sharply, especially steel, with ship steel plates rising by as much as 29% to 33%. The grain index rose by 9.1%. Among the 22 items in this category, the prices of about 20 items rose sharply, such as wheat, which rose by 15% due to sharp overseas increases, and flour, which rose by 15% due to strong sales in North China. According to a Chicago telegram on December 15, the futures market price for wheat at 60 pounds per bushel this month was US$1.33, an increase of 14.7% compared to US$1.16 on the same day last month, which is the same trend as in Shanghai. Other items such as beans, sorghum, and corn rose by 3% to 11%. Although the autumn harvest of white rice was abundant in various places and the arrival of Ke Xian rice in Shanghai was strong, prices still rose by 2% to 7%, except for a slight drop in Xiang rice. The fuel index rose by 8.6%. The original value of white coal and bituminous coal was to sell them, but the sources were sharply reduced due to the Sui War, the Shaanxi Incident, and the shallow Yangtze River and the freezing of Yingkou. Market prices rose sharply by 11% to 30%. Firewood and charcoal also rose in tandem. The textile index rose by 4.9%. The largest price increases were for cotton yarn and cotton cloth, mainly due to strong sales and a shortage of spot goods. For example, the price of 16-count Baoding cotton yarn this month was 360 yuan per bale, a new high since records began in 1919, an increase of 100 yuan compared to 166 yuan in July 1935. The increase in cotton was smaller, probably due to this year's abundant harvest. The divergence between yarn and cotton prices is becoming more pronounced. Ji Man Douppion silk is in short supply and printing sales are strong, and prices have also risen. However, the prices of one-quarter of the items in this category remained stable, otherwise the increase in the index would have been even greater. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Prospects for Family Education</h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>Family education is the foundation of all children's education. Social education and school education can only be effectively connected after the initial stage of family education. Some say that the family is the bedrock of society, and the foundation of society is formed by its individual families. Women are the central figures in the family. If we compare the family to a school, then women are the faculty, and the children are the students.</p>
<p>If we study child psychology, we can understand that the period before a child reaches school age – before the age of six – is the most important learning period. Every child is born without inherent intelligence, only a pure desire for knowledge. During this period, children have the greatest capacity for learning and imitation. This is evident in the way children under two or three years old can learn to speak common languages. Therefore, children in this period are most likely to learn various habits and fundamental concepts.</p>
<p>During the pre-school years, children have no opportunity to experience school education, let alone social education. Thus, this is an important period when the family bears sole responsibility for education. Family education is the starting point for all life training. The development of physique, mood, behavior, morality, intelligence, and habits all depend on good family education. Even when children reach school age and education is the responsibility of the school, they still spend much of their time at home. For example, daily routines like eating, sleeping, and living all take place within the family. Even after a child starts school, the importance of family education remains. School education is inherently mechanical and cannot be as vibrant or deeply experiential as family education.</p>
<p>Last year, I visited many charitable children's organizations and orphanages. I was very impressed with them. Although they were groups or institutions, they placed great emphasis on family education in addition to school education. In terms of etiquette, personality, behavior, habits, labor, and thought guidance, as well as physical health and intellectual knowledge, they were much better than in ordinary families. This is because their teachers and nannies are knowledgeable, dedicated, and neither overindulgent nor abusive like some mothers. They reward good children and give disciplinary measures to those who are mischievous, turning neglected, homeless children into hardworking and dedicated kids. Inspired by this impression, I began to think about what it takes to meet the requirements of family education. First, we should have full cultivation of our own body and mind. Second, we must completely abandon the concept of patriarchal traditional habits. Third, children should develop good habits and character. Fourth, we should study the necessary knowledge and common sense of child education. Fifth, parents should be fair and correct to their children. Sixth, do not engage in obscene or superstitious behavior in front of children... In short, we cannot allow children to have bad impressions or acquire bad habits at any time or place.</p>
<p>"Once, Mencius' mother chose a neighborhood," because she was afraid that her child would be affected by the bad children in the neighborhood, so she had to choose a neighborhood to live in. Proximity to vermilion makes one red; proximity to ink makes one black. Children's temperaments are most easily assimilated.</p>
<h3>Women of the Future</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xiuqing</p>
<p>The year 1937 has arrived. Everyone starts the first day with excitement and joy, but everyone (except for those who are numb) has a terrible shadow imprinted in their hearts. Everyone knows that the road to "revival" is not easy. There are many rugged paths and obstacles blocking us. Therefore, we have to put all our strength into fighting, fighting. Although the enemy is much stronger than us, if we rely on our enthusiasm and struggle hard, we will one day overcome the enemy. Since everyone has a dark shadow deeply imprinted in their hearts, I hope they will not feel cold, timid, or discouraged because of the shadow. They should strive to remove this shadow.</p>
<p>Women are naturally very busy today, but I hope that women will not forget the responsibility they should assume this year in the midst of their busy schedule. This responsibility has been neglected by women throughout history. In any case, please women take on this important responsibility from today!</p>
<p>Everyone understands that there is no child who cannot be taught well, but whether a child can be taught well is the greatest responsibility of women. A child is a blank sheet of white paper, and the mother is the artist holding the pen. The quality of the picture depends entirely on how the artist wields the pen. Therefore, women who are not concerned about their children are guilty as mothers. A nation is not sound if it lacks sound youth. And youth is not sound because of a lack of sound children. But children are unsound because of the fault of the mother. From this perspective, the nation's lack of revitalization is the fault of women. Moreover, China, with its frail body, has embarked on a dangerous road, and it goes without saying that it desperately needs strong young people. In other words, it also desperately needs strong children.</p>
<p>To cultivate strong children, we should proceed simultaneously in three aspects. First: Mothers must ensure that their children understand everyday knowledge, scientific knowledge, and the overall situation of the country. Second: Mothers must ensure that their children develop perseverance, endurance, fearlessness of hardship, and a willingness to sacrifice, as well as a spirit of great courage. Third: Chinese people are the sick men of East Asia: so the most important thing is to ensure that children have a healthy physique. Mothers should strive to make their children little bulls.</p>
<p>Time flies by quickly, and another year will slip away in an instant. Hurry! Women, please resolve today to take on this key responsibility for revitalizing the nation!</p>
<h3>Japanese Women and Face Powder</h3>
<p>— Yifa</p>
<p>In the Chinese mainland, the Japanese women one sees have faces painted as white as Cao Cao’s. After going to Japan, one realizes that it has become a habit for Japanese women to use face powder. Women in their forties and fifties still have faces full of rouge and powder. The method Japanese women use to apply powder is also unique. Regardless of how cold the weather is, they strip to the waist, kneel in front of the mirror, and apply powder to their heart’s content. The white powder on their necks is piled so thick that even the lines of the skin are buried, forming a very obvious line with their faces. This method of makeup can be used to create an oval face. Kyoto is a place famous for its beauties, and none of the women there go without heavy makeup. Tokyo women have a tendency to wear Western clothes, so the way they use white powder has also changed. They mostly mix and apply it with various colors of rouge, but it is always more heavily and seductively made up than Chinese women.</p>
<p>Female students wear blue uniforms in middle school and do not apply powder. After entering higher women's schools, they begin to style their hair and put on makeup. In the morning, many women with faces full of powder and dressed in dazzling finery walk the streets. If they weren't carrying schoolbags, who would believe that they were going to school to study? In streetcars and quiet alleys, incidents often occur where fake gentlemen and delinquent youths harass female students. This cannot but be blamed on the fact that Japanese female students are too fond of dressing up.</p>
<p>In the past, Japanese white powder contained lead. Actors and geishas who applied too much powder often suffered from lead poisoning and died. In 1929, the government ordered a ban on the sale of white powder containing lead. However, white powder without lead was not only less effective but also easily came off. Finally, the brands Misono and Butterfly Garden released new types of white powder, which stopped the import of foreign goods. Now, it is gradually being improved, and although it is called white powder, it is divided into seven or eight colors. Women can choose to match their clothes, the season, and their individual personalities. Although Chinese women do not consume as much white powder as Japanese women, they spend more on other perfumes and cosmetics. Moreover, the decorations used by Japanese women are all domestic products. They can not only supply their own women but also export them to China. Chinese women, however, reject domestic cosmetics and are proud to buy foreign goods. This is fundamentally different from Japanese women and is very shameful.</p>
<p>The department stores that sell cosmetics are full of young and beautiful female employees. They use the best quality rouge and powder and act as makeup models. They sometimes persuade customers to try various makeup methods in order to promote their white powder. In the past, actresses and geishas were used for advertising. Nowadays, times are different, and a large price is paid to invite movie stars and dance stars to write a letter of praise as an advertisement, which is the same situation as in China. In the early days of the Meiji Restoration, women from good families mostly did not use makeup. White powder could be said to be exclusively used by actresses and geishas, but it is now so universally popular. In recent years, Japanese people have become wealthy, and both men and women are influenced by European culture, and they admire extravagance. Although makeup methods are gradually changing, white powder is always loved by Japanese women.</p>
<h3>Heroines of the Spanish War (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Bo Ken</p>
<p>Who says women are not fit for the battlefield! Throughout the war history of ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, we have indeed seen many heroic deeds of women joining the military. Even in the recent records of the Spanish Civil War, we have discovered four new-style female warriors, which is enough to prove that the ability of modern women to contribute to war is no less than that of men.</p>
<p>Among the modern Spanish female warriors, Ms. La Pasionaria stands out for her bravery. La Pasionaria is a nickname; her real name is Dolores Ibaruri. She is the wife of a miner and used to be a laundress. Two years ago, a rebellion broke out in northern Spain, with the main participants being the miners of Oviedo. They initiated a revolution and organized local Soviets, but eventually collapsed because they could not withstand the repression of the government forces (at that time, the Spanish government bought and hired a large number of Moorish mercenaries known for their bravery). It was in that battle that Ms. Dolores began to show her skills as a female warrior and was nicknamed La Pasionaria.</p>
<p>Everyone who lives in Oviedo is familiar with Ms. Dolores' first battle experience. At that time, a group of miners who were enthusiastic about Bolshevism and participated in the war were suffering from poor weapons. What they carried with them were old, dilapidated short guns or repeating pistols. They felt that these useless weapons posed more danger to them than the arrival of government troops. Soon, they discovered that the tools they used daily in the dark mine layers—dynamite sticks—were indeed the most suitable military weapons. Thus, dynamite sticks became their hand grenades.</p>
<p>At that time, government troops were deployed on the streets and squares of Oviedo. Here or there, an inconspicuous adult woman wearing an old, dirty linen shawl walked over, took a small thing out from under the folds of her skirt, and threw it forcefully at the soldiers. In this way, she killed many soldiers of the government army. This woman was Ms. Dolores, who was known as La Pasionaria.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance, "La Pasionaria" is really a most inappropriate nickname. Ms. Dolores Ibaruri is neither young nor as delicate as a flower. She is already fifty-seven years old this year, and her face has become old and haggard due to her long experience of hardship. Compared with the countless working women who run around the streets of Spain every day, Ms. Dolores really does not have any special appearance.</p>
<p>Her husband was a member of the Soviet government established by the miners. He was killed in battle, and she was arrested and imprisoned. Months later, she was pardoned and released from prison and was elected as a Communist member of Congress.</p>
<p>Recently, after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, Ms. Dolores once again had the opportunity to participate in the war. This time, she was on the side of the government forces. She led the wives and children of the miners of Oviedo to form a women's suicide squad—this was a pioneering initiative in Spain.</p>
<p>Ms. Victoria Kent is another typical Spanish female warrior. She is an outstanding member of Spanish women. She is not a communist, but a reformist Republican. She believes in reform, but does not approve of reforms that overthrow the current order. She was born in Spain, her father is English, and her mother is Spanish; she studied in England and France. She was one of the earliest leaders of the women's suffrage movement in Spain and was dragged out of the gate of King Alfonso's palace by guards. Soon, the imperial system collapsed, Alfonso was expelled, and the Republican government was established. The women's suffrage demanded by Ms. Victoria and others was thus laid the foundation. Ms. Victoria was elected as a member of Congress and appointed as a prison commissioner.</p>
<h3>What should you talk to your children about when they come home from school?</h3>
<p>— Yang Daizhongxin</p>
<p>It must be very happy when you stand at the door and see your children coming back with their schoolbags and laughing and joking. When they reach your arms, you will definitely ask them all sorts of questions, such as whether they were reprimanded by the teacher today? Have they been bullied? Did they fall during physical exercise? Are they hungry? Sometimes you may ask if they understand arithmetic today, etc. All of these fully express your loving heart and reveal your inner joy! However, these many questions have very little educational value. If they are unfortunate enough to grasp and take advantage of your doting shortcomings, it may be harmful.</p>
<p>We should know that education is life, and school is a place to transform life. Your children are constantly transforming their lives and experiences in school, and they always improve their lives a little every day. The first thing a mother should know is whether her child has gained new life and new experiences on this day! Therefore, for young children, you can ask: Have you played any new games today? How do you play them? What are the interesting stories? Can you tell them? As for older children, you can ask them to report on some situations such as meetings, sports, and self-government work. Secondly, you can ask about the situation of learning various subjects and the news in the society, because these are directly or indirectly related to children's lives.</p>
<p>At the same time, we should also know that school and family should be absolutely connected so that the educational effect can be increased. Therefore, the second thing we should ask our children is: Does the teacher have anything to tell us? In this way, he will not forget what the teacher is eager to ask parents to cooperate on.</p>
<p>Again, we want to ask him what homework he has today? Or other preparatory work assigned by the teacher? Then you give him a working time to guide him to work on time, so as to avoid psychological pain caused by not being able to do it or forgetting it. Only in this way can you truly express your true love!</p>
<p>Finally, as a mother, you should know your children's social life. They have started their social period since they were four years old. This social life has a great impact on them. You should ask them in detail about the life they and their good friends have lived? Have they made new companions? Do you want to visit him after school? At the same time, you should always guide him to make excellent friends, avoid abnormal work, and keep him in a beautiful environment forever.</p>
<h3>Long-Term Vision</h3>
<h3>Female Porters of Guangzhou</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>Guangzhou, its commercial development is prosperous. Everything is the same as other major commercial ports. It is an important commercial port that occupies the third position in China, but there are thousands of female porters there. When getting off from the transportation port or station in Guangzhou. You can always see them: some young and strong women, wearing short jackets of blue cloth or Xiangyun gauze, barefoot, like male coolies, are soliciting passengers to carry some heavy luggage for them, and maintain their own lives by obtaining some meager wine money.</p>
<p>In the past, Guangzhou did not have women working as porters. Its emergence cannot but be blamed on the warlords of that year, in the seventh and eighth years of the Republic of China. The warlords in Guangzhou would implement conscription whenever something happened. Most of those conscripted were selected for their strong physique. As a result, those coolies became suitable candidates in their eyes, so those coolies avoided coming out. Under this circumstance, female porters emerged in response to the situation.</p>
<p>Up to now, the number of female porters in Guangzhou is still increasing day by day, because general passengers believe that women are relatively more reliable. Entrusting luggage and other things to them to carry will not lead to the danger of being cheated or extorted, and the carrying price is one-third cheaper than that of male porters, so they are very much needed by a part of the people.</p>
<p>Some of the female porters are employed by some large warehouses. Their work is even more pitiful. In addition to carrying baskets of fruits or boxes of tea, they sometimes have to carry heavy iron parts and rice bags. The wages they earn are mostly calculated according to the number of pieces transported. Generally, each piece can be carried from the transportation port to the warehouse for about two cents, but their foreman still has to take away some.</p>
<p>Most of those female porters could not find work in factories, and they did not have looms in their own homes, nor did they have a place to work as maids. In order to survive instinctively, they were reduced to being porters at docks and stations. However, many of them already have children. Because their husbands cannot support them, they have no choice but to abandon their children and come out to exchange sweat for some money to survive.</p>
<p>As for their work, they have to work at least ten hours a day, but the wages they earn will not exceed eighty cents. Sometimes, regardless of winter or snowy days, if ships dock at the pier in the middle of the night, they have to get up to carry things.</p>
<p>Among the many working women, the female porters of Guangzhou should be considered the most hardworking.</p>
<h3>First Letter</h3>
<p>— Zhuo Dai</p>
<p>Ms. B:</p>
<p>Today I received a letter from Mr. Zhou, which I have already read. Your criticism of me is very good. When the motherland is facing a great disaster, instead of studying some academics that can save the country and benefit the people, I am learning to build a garden, isn't it preparing for the enjoyment of the idle class? No wonder you specifically asked Mr. Zhou to forward a letter to me, saying that I should not be so confused and waste my limited time on unreasonable things. This may also be what people who know me in your place want to say to me?</p>
<p>But you should know that I am a very ordinary person. I have not succeeded in learning academics or swordsmanship, so I cannot even talk about studying academics that can save the country and benefit the people. I still plan to take my previous experience of growing vegetables for seven or eight years and go a step further to learn some gardening art. (Many people also think that I am learning horticulture, which is a complete misunderstanding.)</p>
<p>My original aspiration was only this. Unexpectedly, when I entered school and carefully studied the way of gardening, I discovered unexpected wonders contained in gardening academics. What is it? It is what you call saving the country and benefiting the people. Unexpectedly, gardening is also a weapon to save the country and benefit the people. After hearing this, won't you laugh at me for shouting gardening to save the country like dancing to save the country? I say this not as a joke, but completely based on facts. Now let me talk to you about the outline of gardening separately.</p>
<p>There are several kinds of gardening that I study. The largest is a natural park with an area of tens of miles, and the smallest is a bonsai placed in a rectangular tray, all within the scope of gardening.</p>
<p>Ordinary people only know that there are two kinds of gardens, one is a private garden, and the other is a park. In fact, the classification is not that simple. All public buildings, such as government offices, schools, hospitals, libraries, public assembly halls, etc., are decorated with flowers, trees, and rocks in the remaining land and roads, which also belong to gardening.</p>
<p>In addition, those scenic areas are designated by the government as so-called natural parks, and their arrangement and management are also the work of gardening. What I call saving the country and benefiting the people refers to this kind of natural park. Other things such as urban parks and private gardens are also related to saving the country and benefiting the people, but not as obvious as natural parks.</p>
<p>In recent years, various countries have often used their own scenic areas to be designated as national natural parks and have vigorously promoted them, so they have become famous scenic areas, so that tourists are like weaving. Therefore, this area can absorb countless money from the outside every year. This area has become a rich place. We only need to look at how much money West Lake can attract from the outside world in the spring and autumn seasons every year to understand this meaning.</p>
<p>However, the purpose of the so-called national natural parks in various countries is not only to attract domestic tourists, but also to make grand publicity to the outside world, such as the Niagara Falls in North America. The economic benefits obtained by attracting tourists there every year are 40 million, half of which are foreigners.</p>
<p>Being able to attract foreign money, I feel that it is indeed one of the biggest works of saving the country and benefiting the people in my China, which is now economically invaded by the great powers. Moreover, the expenses required to run a natural park are not much, and it is extremely suitable for the current situation in our country! I plan to start from natural parks and step into the first step of saving the country and benefiting the people in the future. I guess you also agree, right?</p>
<h3>A Page of Unspeakable Diary</h3>
<p>— Qin Chen</p>
<p>A rather thick diary book, recording a year, the number of words is at least six or seven hundred thousand, but most of them are just sunny, rainy days, eating, getting sick, a few friends coming, spending a few dollars... all trivial things that are irrelevant, not to mention keeping secrets, even if it is left in the library, no one will want to read it: I feel too boring when I flip through it at the beginning of the new year, from beginning to end, it seems that only one page is the most exciting - these, this page was originally unspeakable at the beginning. But now it can go everywhere.</p>
<p>"...The sun was extraordinarily energetic in the afternoon, and every chair was sunburned, like it was suffering from chills and fever, burning hot to the touch, but my wife called twice from a friend's house, insisting that I go over for dinner after work. Helplessly, I braved the summer heat and got on the No. 5 tram. The No. 5 tram was crowded as usual. At ×× Road, a lady came up, and I had no choice but to stand up and give up my seat. Unexpectedly, before the lady sat down, another man's buttocks had already scrambled over. I shouldn't have been too enthusiastic for a moment and stopped him with my hand. As a result, the lady sat down, but my thin shoulder had already been hit with a heavy punch, and he even scolded me with many extremely obscene words. Of course, I wanted to resist, but many people next to me had already crowded up to persuade me to stop. My anger had nowhere to vent, and I got off the bus at the first stop in a fit of anger, walking under the sun with my head down without any awareness. At that time, it seemed that a pair of bright eyes were shooting onto my face, but I was too lazy to pay attention. After walking for a while, I suddenly discovered the lady who I had given up my seat to at the second stop. Before I had time to guess why she got off the bus here, she had already started apologizing to me, hoping that I would not be angry because of a scoundrel, and she even tried her best to invite me to go to an ice cream parlor for ice cream. Her attitude was very sincere, her words were full of sympathy, and her demeanor was strangely smart and moving, making me really reluctant to miss this rare opportunity; so we walked into the ice cream parlor together, exchanged surnames, and had a very speculative conversation for more than an hour. We talked about everything, except for my family. She also seemed to be very interested in listening, and from time to time she gave a strangely lovely knowing smile. In the end, I wrote my office address, phone number, and my full name on the crumpled paper I used to replace my handkerchief, and was about to hand it to her, hoping to reserve a chance to meet again; unexpectedly, her face suddenly underwent a strange and inexplicable change. She hurriedly crumpled the paper into a ball, stuffed it into her purse, got up and snatched the bill, and said that she had other important matters to attend to, and left in a rickshaw in a hurry.</p>
<p>When I found my wife's friend's house, they couldn't help but question me why I was getting off work so late; it was not difficult to tell a lie, so I lightly concealed it. Later, I suddenly found a small photo on the wall. This small photo really gave me a big shock. It turned out to be a group photo of my wife, her friend, and another lady, and this other lady was the one who had just parted ways with me in the ice cream parlor. I hurriedly asked my wife: "Who is this?"</p>
<p>"Eh! Don't you know? She's Hui Xin's (wife's friend) younger sister! Look how pretty she is!" My wife said proudly. I really didn't know how to answer her."</p>

<h3>The Xi'an Incident and Telecommunications</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The Xi'an Incident has gradually been settled, and Commander-in-Chief Chiang has also safely escaped danger. But after the pain has subsided, recalling the situation at that time, at first the people were panicked and dangerous situations arose one after another, and later the people were encouraged and rejoiced. The changes in all these situations depended on the mutual transmission of news, and the telecommunications, from being blocked to being restored, also ended with this incident.</p>
<p>During the period when Commander-in-Chief Chiang was in distress, Xi'an's telecommunications first reported that they were not working. As a result, the people cried out, ran around to inquire, and went to various newspaper bureaus every day to inquire about the opening and closing of the lines. There was an endless stream of people, and telegrams of assistance and rescue from various places also came in one after another, almost without interruption. Others who asked about the situation in Xi'an on the phone were everywhere. When he escaped danger on the 25th of last month, within a few minutes, the long-distance telephone from Beijing to Shaanxi reported to Beijing. In an instant, the news spread everywhere. For a time, the whole country rejoiced, and everyone applauded. On the streets and alleys, only the sound of firecrackers was heard, and a new atmosphere was changed. The enthusiasm of the Chinese people in supporting the leader was fully demonstrated in this Xi'an Incident.</p>
<p>When the circuit is blocked and telecommunications are unavailable, the people's emotions are panicked and unsettled, as if a great disaster is approaching. When the line is restored and telecommunications are normal, the people's emotions turn optimistic, like the opening of wind and clouds. The line is the nerve of the whole country, issuing orders and conveying will, all of which depend on the interconnection of nerves. Since Commander-in-Chief Chiang was in distress, the nerves were abnormal. When the people felt the abnormality of the nerves, they showed a sad face in a hurry. When Commander-in-Chief Chiang escaped danger, the nerves were completely restored. When the people felt the restoration of the nerves, they had a happy look. The safety of the country depends on whether the nerves are healthy or not. We support the leader, love the country, and at the same time pay attention to the safety of the nerves.</p>
<p>In recent years, the telecommunications traffic in our country has made remarkable and rapid progress. The details of the Xi'an Incident relied on the transmission of reports and telephones, which was exceptionally fast. The lines that were destroyed were also repaired very quickly, so that major conveniences in communication could be obtained in a very short time. It is known that developing telecommunications is of great importance to the national interest and the people's livelihood. Since telecommunications are the nervous system of the whole country, maintaining the health of the nerves is our duty. Increasing construction to achieve its full development depends on the supervision and promotion of the whole country from top to bottom.</p>
<h3>The State of Telecommunications Administration in the Last Half Year</h3>
<p>— Huang Xiuqing</p>
<p>This article is the transcript of a speech given by Mr. Huang Xiuqing, Section Chief of the Ministry of Communications, at the Central Broadcasting Station on January 13, 1937. It thoroughly elucidates the state of telecommunications administration in the second half of 1936. The editor specifically requested Mr. Huang to provide this transcript for publication in our journal to inform our readers. – The Editor</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications received a letter from the Broadcasting Affairs Administration, stipulating that the broadcast dates for reports on the administrative situation of various agencies from January to June 1937. Today is the scheduled date for the report from the Directorate General of Telecommunications. The Directorate General of Telecommunications has dispatched me to present the report, titled "The State of Telecommunications Administration in the Last Half Year."</p>
<p>Regarding the telecommunications administration of the past year, the comprehensive article "One Year of Communications Administration" by Acting Minister Yu and Vice Minister Peng has clearly explained it. This article has been published in major newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, and I believe everyone has already read it. What I will be discussing now is merely a more detailed explanation of the state of telecommunications administration from July to December of last year. For the sake of clarity, I will divide it into five areas: telecommunications management, engineering, operations, personnel, and finance.</p>
<p>A. Telecommunications Management</p>
<p>According to the Telecommunications Regulations, telecommunications in our country should be uniformly managed by the Ministry of Communications. In special circumstances, with the approval of the Ministry of Communications, local governments, public or private organizations, or individuals may also establish telecommunications services. However, in reality, in addition to the above two situations, there are also many telecommunications businesses established in various places without the approval of the Ministry of Communications. In order to exercise its authority, the Ministry of Communications should supervise them. The telecommunications management work in the past half year has mainly focused on this. The following are some of the important measures taken: 1. Adjusting the long-distance telephone services of various provinces; 2. Regulating broadcasting programs; 3. Supervising privately-operated local telephone services; 4. Regulating private radio stations established by public organizations and societies; 5. Unifying the authority to approve the installation of dedicated telephone lines, etc. As for the telecommunications bureaus directly managed by the Ministry, those added in the past half year include 40 wired telegraph bureaus (including business offices and agency offices), one wireless radio station, and 28 long-distance telephone offices, all with the aim of facilitating communication and developing business.</p>
<p>B. Telecommunications Engineering</p>
<p>Since the telecommunications industry in our country needs to be expanded, engineering is of paramount importance in all undertakings. Since 1932, in terms of line expansion, the annual rate has been around 10,000 kilometers. Among these, the expansion of long-distance telephone lines has been particularly rapid. The telecommunications engineering work in the past half year has continued the work of the past and paved the way for the future. The following is a report on the implementation:</p>
<p>(1) Wired Telegraph Lines: 1,235 kilometers of new lines were installed, 2,265 kilometers of lines were repaired, and 2,754 kilometers of lines were added.</p>
<p>(2) Wired Telegraph Equipment: (1) For the Hankou long-distance duplex line, a Creed receiving perforator was installed at the Hankou Bureau; (2) For the Shanghai-Hankou duplex line, a vibrator was installed at each of the Shanghai, Suzhou, Xunwu, and Wuhan bureaus; (3) Wei-style single-current booster motors were installed at the Huaining, Bijie, Shantou, Ganxian, and Jiangshan bureaus; (4) A storage battery was installed in Zhengxian; (5) A Morse machine was installed in Shangrao and Badong respectively; (6) The three circuits from Hankou to Shashi, Xinyang, and Laohekou were all upgraded with a Morse duplex machine; (7) Eighty audio machines were upgraded in the Jiangsu and Shandong regions and neighboring bureaus.</p>
<p>(3) Wireless Telegraph Equipment: (1) An automatic transmitter was installed in each of the Beijing, Hankou, Tianjin-Shanghai, and Gan bureaus; (2) A 2,000-watt machine was installed in Shanghai; (3) A 250-watt machine was installed in Xiamen; (4) A 500-watt machine was installed in Nanjing, Chang'an, and Lanzhou respectively.</p>
<p>(4) Long-Distance Telephone Routes: 5,077 kilometers of lines were installed. Amplification stations have been completed in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Yinjiahui, and Jiujiang. Those being installed or about to be installed include Nanchang, Tongshan, Zhengxian, Baxian, Chang'an, Changsha, Yuanling, and Jiangshan.</p>
<p>(5) Domestic Wireless Telephone: The Shanghai machine is installed at the Zhenru Liuhang International Radio Station, the Hankou machine uses the Luojiadun station in Hankou as the transmitting station, and the Wuchang long-wave station as the receiving station. The Guangzhou machine has its transmitting station in Dongshipai Township and its receiving station in Hebian Village. All of these were fully operational in the second half of 1936.</p>
<p>(6) The engineering equipment of the Chengdu Broadcasting Station has been completed and officially began broadcasting in November of last year.</p>
<p>C. Telecommunications Operations</p>
<p>Regarding telecommunications operations, there have been many improvements in the past half year. To list them all would take too much time. The general principles are "facilitating communication," "increasing efficiency," and "expanding business." These three points have a consistent and interconnected nature. For example, to facilitate communication, it is necessary to increase efficiency. If efficiency can be increased, business can be expanded. Conversely, if efficiency cannot be increased, communication cannot be facilitated, and how can business be expanded? This is obvious. The following is a report on the telecommunications operations work in the past half year:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding facilitating communication: 1. Organizing ship radio stations; 2. Entrusting railway stations to receive and send telegrams; 3. Compiling Mongolian telegram codes; 4. Reducing domestic telegram rates; 5. Reducing international news telegram rates; 6. Improving social telegram methods; 7. Stipulating the method for returning telegram receipts; 8. Revising local telephone rates; 9. Abolishing long-distance telephone deposits; 10. Reducing rates for calling people, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding increasing efficiency: 1. Converting wired telegraphs to perforators and printing machines; 2. Adding automatic transmitters and receivers to wireless telegraphs; 3. Streamlining wired and wireless telegraph services; 4. Streamlining telegram handling procedures; 5. Stipulating the method for using local telephones; 6. Improving long-distance telephone handling procedures, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding expanding business: 1. Revising the Sino-French wireless telegraph agreement; 2. Proceeding with the revision of the Sino-German and the signing of the Sino-Soviet wireless telegraph agreements; 3. Proceeding with the signing of the Sino-American and Sino-British wireless telephone agreements; 4. Expanding the local telephone service area; 5. Promoting public telephones; 6. Revising the domestic long-distance telephone business regulations; 7. Opening long-distance wireless telephone services between Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Guangzhou, increasing the spatial distance of the communication range to about 1,200 kilometers; 8. Increasing the number of interconnected long-distance telephone locations by 445, increasing the line distance of the communication range from 560 kilometers to 1,152 kilometers.</p>
<p>The above are all improvements in telecommunications operations in the past half year. In addition, the reorganization of official and military telegram fees is also worth reporting. According to investigations, the number of words sent in official and military telegrams over the years accounts for more than 60% of the total number of words in telegrams, and the arrears amount to more than 3 million yuan, which has had a significant impact on the telecommunications economy. After Acting Minister Yu took over the affairs of the Ministry, he believed that the first step in increasing revenue for telecommunications was to reorganize the collection of official and military telegram fees. He then submitted a proposal to the Executive Yuan, and from July 1, 1936, strictly ordered the implementation of a method for collecting and restricting official and military telegram fees. At the same time, he submitted a proposal to the Military Affairs Commission to re-define the bandit suppression areas and promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Military Emergency Secret Telegrams in Bandit Suppression Areas." Since its implementation, it has been very effective. Monthly income can be increased by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Most telegrams sent by various political and military agencies, except for a few, can now be paid in cash according to regulations. Unnecessary telegrams are now restricted, unlike the previous arbitrary sending.</p>
<p>D. Telecommunications Personnel</p>
<p>The important matters regarding telecommunications personnel in the past half year are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Opening telegraph operator training classes: In recent years, the number of telegraph operators retiring, dying, and leaving their posts in various bureaus has been quite large. All vacancies need to be filled urgently. Therefore, the Ministry has advertised in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Nanchang, Guangzhou, Zhengxian, Jinan, Changsha, and Hangzhou to recruit 200 high school graduates. Training classes will be opened in the local telegraph bureaus to teach basic telecommunications knowledge and skills, with graduation scheduled after six months, in order to fill the vacancies.</p>
<p>(2) Approving the number of staff members in various bureaus: For more than ten years, the number of staff members in various bureaus has not been formally approved, resulting in inconsistencies in the number of personnel and uneven workload. In order to save expenses and increase work efficiency, the Ministry has dispatched personnel to various important bureaus to conduct on-site investigations, approve the number of staff members according to actual needs, and has successively announced the results. Personnel assignments will now have standards.</p>
<p>(3) Military training for telegraph and telephone operators: Telecommunications and transportation are of great importance to military affairs. Therefore, telegraph and telephone operators should have considerable military knowledge in order to perform their duties satisfactorily. In view of this, the Ministry has selected young telegraph and telephone operators from various bureaus to receive military training in batches, so that they have sound military knowledge and physique.</p>
<p>E. Telecommunications Finance</p>
<p>In the second half of 1936, the income from international telegrams was the most prosperous. Wired telegram fees increased by about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month due to the reorganization of official and military telegram fees, as mentioned above. With the increase in the number of local telephone bureaus and the successive commissioning of long-distance telephone projects in nine provinces, the monthly income from local telephones has increased by more than 10,000 yuan since July, and the income from long-distance telephones within the nine-province plan has increased from more than 11,000 yuan to about 30,000 yuan. In summary, the total monthly cash income from telegram and telephone fees has gradually increased from more than 1.8 million yuan to more than 2 million yuan. On the expenditure side, the average monthly recurring expenses are about 1.5 million yuan. The revenue and expenditure are balanced with a surplus, but the burden of repaying debt principal and interest is too heavy, and the cost of various construction materials is very high, so the deficit is significant. In the past half year, new debts have been raised to maintain operations. In the future, with the development of business and the reduction of debt, the telecommunications economy will have the hope of prosperity.</p>
<p>The above are the major aspects of the state of telecommunications administration in the second half of 1936. Due to time constraints, I cannot describe them one by one. I apologize for that. In short, the telecommunications industry has now reached a period of "self-reliance," and all telecommunications personnel have a spirit of "striving for progress." In the future, as the country's politics become more stable and industry and commerce become more prosperous, there will be more people using telecommunications. Then, the telecommunications industry will surely prosper!</p>
<h3>Two New Measures for Domestic Long-Distance Telephone by the Ministry of Communications (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pu Zhan</p>
<p>New Year's New Contributions</p>
<p>2.  Calling a Person: If the caller or the designated receiver is out for some reason when the call is connected, and if the caller knows where the receiver is, or the receiver knows where the caller is, and the location also has a telephone within the same local telephone service area as the caller or receiver, the user can inform the telephone bureau of the telephone number at that location to have the call rerouted. If the caller or receiver is still not reached after the bureau reroutes the call, the fee should be paid according to regulations and the call terminated. If the caller is reached and the call goes through, only the call fee needs to be paid, and no additional fees will be charged for the rerouting procedure.</p>
<p>The wheel of time transforms human life from simple to complex, from narrow to broad. Similarly, the application of telephones has evolved from local to long-distance. In modern China, there are certainly many people who do not know how to use the telephone, but there are also many busy people who cannot do without long-distance telephone calls for a moment. In order to meet the needs of the times, the Ministry of Communications has been working hard to expand long-distance telephone lines. It also actively improves long-distance telephone services with the interests of users as the premise. Not to mention the past, even the recently stipulated measures that took effect on January 1, 1937, state that registered users who have paid the long-distance telephone deposit or have filled out the long-distance telephone connection application form may borrow the telephone of unregistered users to make long-distance telephone calls. Furthermore, if the caller or receiver of a person-to-person call is out, the calling or receiving user may request the telephone bureau to reroute the long-distance call to the telephone at the location of the caller or receiver to complete the call. Although the scope of these measures is limited to within the same local telephone service area, they are already extremely thoughtful for the convenience of callers and receivers using long-distance telephones.

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>"Asceticism" and "Murderous Intent"</h3>
<p>— Qun</p>
<p>The newspapers of the 14th had such a news item:</p>
<p>"Wang Baolu, a native of Yangzhou, is 58 years old and has been a pastor in a certain church in this city. He has no wife and is friendly with Qin Liantao, a local. Qin is 26 years old and also unmarried. Therefore, he and Wang are very close. Every time he is free from work, he often goes to Wang's residence to linger. They are friends who have forgotten their age, and their friendship is very strong. Recently, Qin was introduced by relatives and friends to marry a certain woman on the first of this month. As a newlywed, he became estranged from Wang. Wang, although nearly sixty years old, has not diminished in his passion. Seeing Qin infatuated with his new love and forgetting his old friend, he could not help but feel jealous and turned his kind and amiable pastor's face into a murderous intent..."</p>
<p>Reading such news would make people puzzled: Since they are friends who have forgotten their age and have a strong friendship, why would the friend become jealous and develop murderous intent after getting married?</p>
<p>I don't understand. But I remember that long-term abstinence can cause mental disorders. It just so happens that the murderer is also a pastor, and he is 58 years old and still "has no wife." Therefore, I can't help but suspect that the reason for the sudden murderous intent is probably because his mental state has become abnormal.</p>
<p>I have a collection of miscellaneous essays by Mr. Lu Xun called "Grave." In the middle, there is an essay called "The Doctrine of Widows," which mentions the mental disorders of single people. Now I will copy a section below as an explanation of the "murderous intent." --</p>
<p>"As for those who live a single life out of necessity, whether male or female, they often inevitably undergo changes in their mental state, and most of them have stubborn, suspicious, and insidious characteristics. The clergymen of medieval Europe, the ladies-in-waiting of the Imperial Palace before the Meiji Restoration in Japan, and the eunuchs of past dynasties in China, their cold and ruthless nature far exceeded that of ordinary people. Other single people are the same. Since their lives are not in accordance with nature, their mental state also changes greatly. They feel that everything in the world is tasteless and that people are hateful. When they see some innocent and happy people, they feel hatred. Especially because of the suppression of sexual desire, they are sensitive and suspicious of other people's sexual matters; they are envious and therefore jealous. In fact, this is also inevitable; forced by society, they certainly cannot but pretend to be pure on the surface, but in their hearts, they cannot escape the pulling of instinct and unconsciously squirm with a sense of regret."</p>
<p>Using this passage to explain the reason for "developing murderous intent" should not be too wrong. Although this still needs to be confirmed by specialists. However, from our superficial perspective, we know that in people with abnormal psychology, the desire for exclusive possession of love, which is "absolutely becoming one's own," is particularly strong. There are many examples. "Infatuated with his new love and forgetting his old friend, therefore developing murderous intent" can also be considered an example.</p>
<p>To divert the question, one would naturally have to ask why celibacy is formed. The answer is actually already available above. For example, the eunuchs of past dynasties in China were mostly formed "by being forced by society." However, "on the surface, they certainly cannot but pretend to be pure, but in their hearts, they cannot escape the pulling of instinct and unconsciously squirm with a sense of regret." Thus, tragedy is achieved.</p>
<p>However, even though things are like this, in China's traditional concept, it has always advocated "six roots of purity." Especially when it comes to the word "sex," people will cover their faces and run away, as if encountering some kind of flood or beast.</p>
<p>Although even today, even monks who are bearing the sign of "six roots of purity" have secret mistresses, and some file lawsuits for property, the notion of "sex" as a flood or beast remains unchanged.</p>
<h3>The Punishment Room for the Canadian Quintuplet Sisters</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The movie "The Country Doctor", starring the world-famous Dionne quintuplets, has been shown in this city. I think readers have not forgotten it. Now these five little sisters still live in a specially built, exquisite nursery, still managed by Dr. Dafoe, with three nurses, one teacher, and supervisory guidance. Their every word and deed, like the emperor in an autocratic era, have detailed records, like the daily life of the emperor. What if one of them commits a mistake? Dr. Dafoe does not advocate corporal punishment, so he has never used corporal punishment on the five little sisters. So he came up with a method: he would lock the child who made a mistake in a specially designated "quiet room" and not allow her to play with the other four sisters. In addition to being used for punishment, the "quiet room" is also used for children who have contracted infectious diseases to live in, separating them from the rest of the sisters.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Dafoe: "This is the only method of punishing children for bad behavior in the nursery. When the five children were young, we only forbade the child with bad behavior to play with the other four sisters to make her feel something. Now that the children are older, this method no longer works, so we have to lock the bad child in a separate 'quiet room'. The 'quiet room' is eight feet long and six feet wide, and it is very bright, with large glass windows to let in plenty of sunlight and air. It is the same as the other rooms in the nursery. The room is only furnished with a table, a chair, and a few picture books, and everything is very comfortable. But there are two things that must be paid special attention to: one is that there is nothing in the room that can cause the child to hurt herself, and the other is that the essential element of punishment is that she must be left alone in the room, separated from the rest of her sisters, to make her feel lonely, which will achieve the purpose of punishment." Dr. Dafoe also said: "I am very opposed to some parents locking children who have made mistakes in a dark room, a basement, or in a narrow and uncomfortable place. That is barbaric and cruel. This kind of punishment will have a very bad effect on the child's nervous system immediately or in the future. Our 'quiet room' is different from this. Children feel very comfortable staying inside, and there are also toys that the other sisters play with, but they just can't play with them together. We often explain to the children why the bad child is locked in the 'quiet room' and tell them that after being locked inside, they will only be released to play with the rest of their sisters when their temper has improved. Our punishment method is very effective, so there is no need to use other punishment methods."</p>
<p>Now let me briefly describe the nursery. When it was first built, the children were young, and a few rooms were enough. As the children gradually grew up, the house had to be expanded step by step. Inside, there are entertainment rooms, offices, bedrooms, bathrooms, dining rooms, and kitchens. The entertainment room has all kinds of toys suitable for age and season, and the office has many charts hanging on it. The physical development and intellectual progress of the five children can be seen at a glance by looking at the charts. The toiletries and bathtubs in the bathroom are all specially made for children. There is also a special entertainment room with a small piano, gramophone, and other musical instruments. Dancing, playing music, and telling stories are all done in this room. In total, the equipment in the whole house is worth more than 100,000 Chinese dollars. That money was earned by the five little sisters themselves, and they also have a lot of money deposited in the bank. The nursery looks very grand. The house is two stories. Upstairs, in addition to the bedrooms for the director and the housekeeper, the rest is used as a storage room, storing all kinds of toys and clothes that are not currently used. Many of them are gifts from visitors. The number of personnel regularly used and temporarily hired in the house is usually between ten and fifteen. New houses will have to be built later to hire new staff. Before the summer of this year, it is planned to build a long fence around the nursery to surround the house, and enclose several acres of woodland behind the house. Then, in addition to playing in the large sports field, the five little sisters will also be able to take walks and relax among the flowers and plants in the natural woodland and will not get lost. At that time, the nursery can become a small village, as if it were a paradise.</p>
<h3>In the Cold Wind</h3>
<p>— Lei Feng Wei Ke</p>
<h3>Watching Executions</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>When I was little, I was bold enough to go watch executions all by myself. When I say 'all by myself,' it's not like I was the only one there; besides me, there were naturally many other strangers who also went to watch the commotion together. It's just that I was on my own. "Watching executions" meant watching people being killed, but people didn't directly say "killing"; instead, they all called it that, perhaps to make it less obvious. They put a cloak on the words, hiding the gruesome reality. In that place, there were often executions to watch. The execution ground wasn't that far from my home. Children love to run around and are even more interested in seeing anything new and unusual, so I often went to be a spectator at killings.</p>
<p>Speaking of killing can make one's heart jump with fear. What a terrible and horrifying thing it is! Adults usually absolutely forbid children from watching, often warning them, "Don't go watch executions! The souls of those executed will follow you, and you'll have nightmares!" But I was skeptical of these words, mostly not very afraid, so the warnings weren't very effective. When an execution was happening, I'd hide it from the adults and secretly follow a group of people who were going to see the spectacle.</p>
<p>Whenever there was an execution, it was indeed lively. In this place, usually as quiet as an ancient city, even a minor event could stir up ripples in the stagnant hearts of the people. The killing, of course, stirred them up even more. When an execution was happening, first the "da-da-dian" bugle would sound. Everyone, hearing this familiar sound, would come out of their houses, like soldiers hearing the assembly call, and stand by the roadside. At this time, you would see a small squad of soldiers carrying guns and ammunition, followed by the person going to be executed, and then a crowd following to watch the excitement, summoned by the bugle.</p>
<p>It was said that those going to be executed were all heinous murderers and arsonists. Because they were murderers and arsonists, they had to be executed. A killer being killed fits the old saying, "Treat others as they treat you." But they didn't look very fierce or scary; they were no different from ordinary people. The only difference was that they were going to be executed, while we were watching them be executed. So why did they do murder and arson in the first place? There was no chance to ask them. At this time, they were about to die; what else was there besides living or dying?</p>
<p>Those going to be executed had a narrow, long white cloth flag with a triangular tip stuck on their backs. On it were written in black characters, "Executed Thief XXX." Around the words were red circles, like a primary school student's writing practice sheet. Their hands were tied behind their backs, and they wore shackles on their feet. The iron rings of the shackles clanged against each other. They walked with difficulty, step by step towards death. But you could believe that they certainly didn't want to die, but wanted to live! But now they weren't allowed to live; they had to die.</p>
<p>On the way, some of them appeared calm and unconcerned, what is called "composed." Some even sang little tunes and said, "In twenty years, I'll be a good man again." Then the onlookers would click their tongues in praise, calling them "Truly fearless heroes!" Naturally, no one would think about their true feelings at this moment under these subconscious actions. Perhaps they were being attacked and possessed by intense terror, or perhaps they still thought about living in extreme confusion, but living was clearly hopeless.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the execution ground, at the sound of the gun, they would fall to the ground. After twitching for a while, they would stop moving. Just like that, a minute ago, they were a living person; a minute later, their precious and irreplaceable life was taken away. But no one felt any sorrow for this most tragic scene of life. Naturally, the onlookers were not related to them, and what was there to pity about people who were supposed to die? Everyone clapped enthusiastically, loudly cheering and shouting "Good!" However, it was said that this was to protect themselves, because this could scare away the vengeful spirits, so they wouldn't follow people.</p>
<p>If that's the case, then why watch? Wouldn't it be easier not to watch? But everyone didn't. Whenever there was an execution, they still wanted to watch, yet they were afraid of the vengeful spirits following them. It was truly ridiculous. But it was originally necessary for everyone to watch. It had its significance when people watched, to "deter others from following suit," to "kill one to warn a hundred." That's why they first sounded the bugle "da-da-dian," to tell people: Someone is going to be killed, everyone come and watch, see if you're afraid! It was used in this way.</p>
<p>On the one hand, people kill; on the other hand, people are killed; and on yet another hand, people are indifferent. Moreover, they even cheer on the sidelines. The world seems to be maintained like this. And they not only cheer, but also complain that executions aren't as good as beheadings. They vividly describe how, with a "whack" sound, the head rolls to the ground, and red blood immediately gushes out like a fountain. It's truly a sight to see! Then the older generation would talk about the execution of revolutionaries back in the day, and the younger generation would hate that they were born too late to see it, and envy those who had seen it. Thinking about letting this situation continue, what a terrible result there would be?</p>

<h3>A Perfect Horror Film "Midnight Song"</h3>
<p>Please pay attention everyone. A horror film full of poetry is about to appear in China's film industry. This is "Midnight Song," produced by Xinhua Company at great cost of capital and time.</p>
<p>We are here to give you some advance reports: This "Midnight Song" is directed by Ma-Xu Weibang. Some say that Ma-Xu Weibang's plays are full of sadness, but in fact they have a more positive and upward meaning. "Midnight Song" depicts the story of a young man struggling under the encirclement of evil forces.</p>
<p>The story unfolds in a gloomy, empty theater, where, in the dead of night, a ghostly singing voice and a zombie-like figure with a hideous face appear. In order to achieve the full effect of the play, the background arrangement, the structure of the light, and the makeup of each character's face are all given a terrifying nature, creating a unique style.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, in addition to Hu Ping, Jin Shan, Gu Eryi, Shi Chao, Gu Menghu, and Wang Weiyi, who had great success in "Night of Carnival," Zhou Wenzhu, Xu Manli, Xiao Ying and other famous stars have joined. Due to proper distribution, everyone happily takes on the role they are responsible for.</p>
<h3>Grand Theater Screens "Foolish Scholar"</h3>
<p>The Grand Theater will be showing the romantic musical comedy "Foolish Scholar" (It's Great to Be in College) starting today. This film is the latest prestigious production of 20th Century Fox, co-starring ten comedy song and dance stars. Among American films, there have been several with the background of college or football. The film "Foolish Scholar", although also using the above-mentioned themes to describe the romanticization and football craze of American college students, the performance is absolutely different from other films. It has novel songs and dances and novel jokes. From the opening to the closing, the audience only feels lively, interesting and funny. There is absolutely no foot of film that makes people feel dull. This is indeed a rare entertainment film that is worth anyone's smile.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on the "Drama Workshop" Rehearsing "Sunrise"</h3>
<p>The long-rumored "Drama Workshop" rehearsal of "Sunrise" is now actively preparing. They often rehearse until late at night. Although it is a cold winter night, they still have no fatigue. Their love for drama is evident.</p>
<p>The director, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian, has been particularly busy recently. On the one hand, he is enthusiastically rehearsing "Sunrise", and on the other hand, he is also working as a director in other theater groups.</p>
<p>The script of "Sunrise" needs no introduction. Anyone who has seen Mr. Cao Yu's first work, "Thunderstorm", I think will definitely pay attention to it. In "Sunrise", his deeper observation is more successful than "Thunderstorm". The whole play is tense and vivid, and each scene can arouse the audience's high emotions. The sensation during the performance in the future can be expected.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the theater group, after their public performance in Shanghai, they plan to go to Nanjing for another performance. In this way, the capital audience's visual feast is not shallow, so a preview is given first.</p>
<p>Most of the participants in the theater group are former members of the "Fudan Drama Club". Their past achievements are deeply imprinted in the minds of the audience. Other personnel are also first-class talents in the theater world. This collaboration will be even more perfect.</p>
