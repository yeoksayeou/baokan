<p>時評</p>
<h3>空言與事實</h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>林大將拜受大命之始。卽發表施政大綱。謂“爲實現東亞之安定。萬邦之共榮起見。遂行舉國一致之外交工作。期使國際關係明朗。”其後在議會中演說。更闡明此旨。謂中日兩國應“互相携手。以期實現東亞之安定。…”卽一手執劍。一手執大陸政策方案的杉山元陸相。亦隨聲附和。謂“陸軍未有對華侵略之計劃。”人民方面。則東京日日新聞當內閣更迭之時。發表社論。促未來政府注意親善外交。“與他國發生親善關係。乃日本人民普遍的要求。政府關於外交方面任何政策。必以增進友誼爲其最後目標。一個內閣不問其組成分子如何。應不改此種基木原則的政策。”日本名政論家室伏高信亦謂“日本應助成統一中國的國家。日本援助中國與中國結納。尤須走王者之大道。”最近上海日本商工會議所會長吉田政治又警告其邦人。謂“日本必須芟除嚴峻之對華政策。而採取在道德上能爲中國政府接受的切實政策。”凡此種種。都足表示日本朝野已經改變舊時面目。而對於中國。有一種新的認識。新的了解。同時亦在努力改正他們過去的錯悞。以求達到兩國密切的合作。然而事實果然如此麼。</p>
<p>如果我們把眼光放遠些。如果我們明白中日邦交調整是九一八以來早已有的口號。如果我們把在華駐屯軍最近所演出的種種車實結合起來作整個的觀察。我們可以知道親善的口號是一回事。而對華的侵路又是一回事。儘管日本外交當局主張外交一元化。而杉山元陸相也答應對於外交方針的一致。日本陸軍將加以嚴密的注意。可是他們對於華北。郤還藉口有旣成軍事協定的存在。堅持看陸軍必須直接折衝。所謂直接折衝。其意義何指。十分明顯。今後對華北方策當然還楚有進無退。日本華北駐屯軍的政策以完成華北“特殊化”爲其唯一目標。這一目標一日不達到。他們的詭謀將一日不放棄。最近化名“大公園”的某國人指使漢奸蕭德平等組織僞共黨機關。擾亂津市治安。其用意無非是在造成藉口。以便壓迫冀察常局達到特殊化的目的罷了。</p>
<p>再就兩國經濟提携說一下。據日前同盟社電。日本四相會議決定對華政策。“力避對於中國民衆。與以壓迫觀念之政策。企圖以兩國民間之經濟的及文化的提携。使兩國間空氣明朗化。”經濟提携。必須兩國站在平等的地位。在互利的原則下進行。才是眞正的親善。然而這原則却是對方絕對不會承認的。日文上海日報不久以前曾有社評。露骨地表示反對這種意見。該報認爲“那些主張中日合作的人。應該明自兩國並不立於平等地位……日本在政治上經濟上及其他部門的發展。遠超過中國。因此對於兩國未來的交涉。主張平等理論者。那是極不聰明的一件事。……”這種意見可以代表許多佩指揮刀者及受指揮刀支配者的意見。如果這種意見不放棄。恐怕就是每天在播音親善。每天在派經濟使節文化使節。其結果也許依然等於零吧。</p>

<h3>西班牙內亂監察計劃</h3>

<p>㊁調整委員會主席樸萊茅斯勳爵繼又以英國政府名義、正式提議、現在西班牙助戰之各國志願兵、應悉數召回、法•俄•捷克•瑞典•比利時五國代表均贊助此項提議、葡萄牙代表則謂、該國業已準備一項法律、俾將葡國人土之在外國從事煽亂者、予以召回、樸萊茅斯勛爵則謂、渠上項提議、不僅指從事政治煽亂者而言、任何人士、凡現在西國參加內戰者、均應在召回之列、至是義德兩國代表又復提出保留、並稱、西班牙銀行在外國存金之“中立化”問題、務當先予解决云云、因此雙方意見相去頗遠、小組委員會茲定於本月五日再行開會討論、（中央社一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>成都與川政</h3>
<p>— 賡雅</p>
<p>成都自本省打破防區制，政局漸趨安定，人口增加，交通發達，工商業亦漸見活動以來，無疑的她從此將披上一件繁榮的新裝了，長江的水，是自西滾滾東流，而都市繁華的趨向，似乎却自東節節逆上，漢口想媲美於上海，重慶文想效𨏞於漢口，成都更想追踪於重慶，自然囉，求乎上得乎中，求乎中得乎下，成都一時限於物質和技術的條件，有些事物追踪不上，裝扮也硬要把它們裝像的，有些可求而致的，如商店翻新出奇的發璜，炫人心目的霓虹燈，中西雜唱聲調悠揚的無綫電收音機，乃至停車道旁選購蜀錦的外國士女，抖擻精神黃昏還佇立街頭指揮交通的童子軍，乍見確很有幾分像十里洋塲，滬漢租界的景像。有些追踪不及的，如不能造柏油路，却非把“三合士”路平滑了發光不可，不能造純西式的商店，店面壁窗，却非借重洋灰粉飾成四式的不可，有些未免追踪得太過了，特別是一般特殊階級的享樂方面，譬如記者剛到成都的那晚上，承航空站車送到一處成都人所謂最上等的旅館“沙利文，”由摟梯上一層樓三層樓地直走到最高層的一個房間裏，那房間的大小設備，實趕不上海三元一間的，但它定價貴至五元五角，而且並非上海式的洗澡間、然這還是該旅館的小房間、其餘則價定“七元”“十數元”“數十元”不等，意料着內地生活程底低的旅人，自然要大吃一驚，追問原故，才曉得這是般特殊階級呼妓及作其他消遺的娛樂所，亦卽上海人所謂“開房間”的安樂窩。更有不惜重金，代購滬蓉航空來回票，由滬召名妓來此作樂的，聞之更令人不勝憤恨，（歐亞航空站主任鄧志谷君，遇客巷謙和，嘗有“乘客非富即貴”之語，今悉此事，不知將作何解？一笑！）般普通市民，極喜歡喝茶，所以茶館之多，直是五步一閣，十步樓的，有人說：“成都以前的電話，不是電話是笑話，”我却說：“成都的公園，不是公園是茶園，”的確，無論哪一個公園，都是一排排地設滿了那種特製的茶椅，而且滿坐了悠閑自在的茶客，很像開什麼高士展覽會似的令人莫　其高深，固然，也有把喝茶當作做買賣的臨時交易所，然這不過是鳳毛麟角而已，最大多數的，却似貪圖那特製的茶椅，化上兩三枚銅元的茶錢，就隨意連唱帶躺地消閒上半日或一天，然後才肯懶佯佯地發駕同鑾，喝茶附帶着的任務，是聽評書聽戲，或者評棋，鬥鳥，據說有一隻金雀鳥，曾替他主人贏得一院很講究的房屋，主人把牠視如愛子，有人出五百元買牠，還不賣，現在已經把牠養到二十三歲了，不知用了多少心血？若把這番心血移用於其他正當事業，即僅是養蜂養兔等等，億料所獲利益，何止鬥鳥所贏之數？此外成都人消閒辦法，還有上酒館（與飯館不同），進戲園，吸公膏，以及筹議建設跳舞場，不勝枚舉。然這一切已足以活畫出深居長江上游的成都，她的物質建設，雖尙遠遜於她所追慕的遙在下游的滬漢各市，但一般有錢有閒者的事樂生活，却已是“青出於藍而勝於藍”了！至於一般動勞大衆，雖同生於天府之國，却判然是地獄之民，這雖是花團錦簇的都市，但若跑到這化團中心地皇城附近去看看飢寒交迫的地獄生活，便“當面現形。”如此矛盾的原因，無非“宰相台肥天下瘦，”大可“不言而喻”了，</p>
<p>成都是蜀漢的故都，牆垣高厚，外環江水，周約三十餘里，係案時張儀所築，形势優美，爲四南各省富有歴史政治性的一名城。現與華陽縣同城而治，街道互相聯貫，坐着人力車巡禮剛看着門牌是成都，轉眼便是華陽的，川滇黔三省商人交易術語中，有云“成都過華陽縣，—縣過縣”者，卽取意“縣”與“現”同音，指賒欠免言也，外城內還有一座皇城，現爲國立成都大學校址，趨訪省府當局，略事觀光，過了一院又一院，恰好作合署辦公之用，不禁竊嘆地區之宏大。但據某主任說：“以前省府地面還更大，可惜被以前的省主席們盜賣不少了。盜賣公產，簡直盜賣到自己放“交椅”的地方，眞是未之前聞，某主任寢室中，雜見置“中日問題之研究”“日本帝國主義侵略史”等書於牀頭，聞其他公務員，亦多以這類書籍爲公餘研究之本。川省目煎政况，據秘書長　鳴喈氏所談：㊀在中央國策指導下，一致團給對外；㊁調整本省人事系統，積極訓練各級公務人員，如開辦縣政，財政統計，保甲，以及農工業技士等各訓練所；㊂建設方面，交通水利生產等均極重視，力求各方面之等量發展，川黔，川陜，川湘二公路已通車，省內路綫計長二千餘公里，今尚繼續不斷修築中，成渝鐵路，亦已動工修築，水利向來援用陳法，頗不注意，現新組水利局，特聘專家負責，同時改良土產，增加產量，先求自給自足，次圖運銷省外國外，其後，某當局又總結了幾句關於應付國難的話：對外則擁護中央及蔣委員長，以國家整個力量，應付外交：對內則一切軍人學生民衆訓練，均以對×爲月標，中國被某國逼到不得已時，非和它拼一拼是不有出路的，山這一席話看來，可知去秋成都民氣、開了一朶民族壯然之花，並非儻來之物。</p>
<p>川局以前的混亂，二十有餘年，以大好河山，豐美物產。良善人民，徒供無知軍閥的蹂𨈆，以致造成民窮財盡的種種惡果，猶幸劉甫澄氏（湘）煎歲放大膽子，親出夔門，請命於中央，而曉然於大地之大，襟度爲開，返川組成新省府，統事權，打破防區制度，從此川省，政治，姑漸臻澄清之域。邇近建廳主持得人，建設成績日著，據調查所得，四川農業，如能改良種子，澈底剷除烟卉，則全省還有二千五百萬人口的餘糧，目前却僅可足用。現建廳已邀川大農院及中央稻麥改進所合組四川稻麥改進所，以從事改種工作，養蠶試用新春種，成績良佳，秋蠶川人原不知飼育，今由江蘇購種試騐，亦已得到意外的收獲，故料蠶絲前途甚有希望。糖產量甚多，現尙有四專家研究改進中，鑛區分佈，不如湖南之多。外人理想石油蘊量必富，實際却不然，金銀銅各鑛層，都很薄，惟鹽鑛鐵鑛的產量却很豐。但開採者不多，且機械工廠極少，致銅鐵等原料尚須外求，川省河流傾瀉度極大，能興辦水電廠之處，有三十八。不過所發出的電力，須與工廠附帶利用；不然僅供電燈，用，似覺不宜，例如岷江上源，除人工作堰，灌溉五百萬畝田外，還可以發出巨量的電力，預算不出用於怎樣適當的工廠？全省電氣使用，僅限於電話電燈兩種，且尚未普遍各縣，惟每縣均設有無綫電收音機，省府各廳及保安處，有伺重要政令，由成都無綫電台播送，卽可無遠弗屆，遍傳各縣。此在政令效率上，效力誠然極大，四川素稱多兵之省雖經整頓縮編，一旦國防發生大故，仍可調用五十團至一百團之數，月聞將士對於如此用途，都非常樂於受命的。總之：川省物力優厚，民氣可用，惜深居腹地，遠距海口，加之逼近英屬，威脅亦在在不小。故開發之以作復興國族所需資源的供給地則可，若視爲復興國族最後的援扎地則不可。</p>

<p>但因時間關係、不能將孫所經手之案、一一查出、祇查出孫吳氏與吳登𤅗（瑞繪絲廠主）折產一案緣孫吳氏名桂貞、與吳登𤅗爲姊弟、當吳氏之父死亡時並無遺產、後吳登𤅗因經營商業起家、積資頗豐、於是孫吳氏卽經一姚月波者介紹、得與孫少卿相識、遂由孫代爲提起民事析產刑事侵佔之訴、當時彼等需索</p>
<p>二十萬元</p>
<p>而吳登𤅗已允給十二萬允、惟吳之子吳申伯心殊不甘、就商於陳霆銳律師、經陳律師與孫吳氏之代理律師顧公秉磋商結果、以四萬元談妥、但孫吳氏實際祇分得一萬二千五百元、相隔數年、孫吳氏曾將此事始末報告湖社、因彼係湖州人也、經湖社委員會致函吳登𤅗調查出欵之實數由吳</p>
<p>予以函復</p>
<p>今該項證據、已由捕房搜集、故依刑法三百四十六條恐嚇詐財及同法一五七條句攬詞訟罪起訴云云、繼山庭上傳吳申伯至案、訊以經過、當時姑母孫吳氏先委陳羣律師致函家父、旋由我委託陳霆銳律師辦理、未經涉訟、卽予和解該四萬元由我交陳律師、陳轉交與姑母之律師顧公秉、我始終</p>
<p>未曾見過</p>
<p>孫少卿、庭上爲發見事實眞相計、卽今禁止旁聽、俟旁聽人退凈後、再向吳訊問、但吳所供、仍與前同、錢庭長乃向孫訪問、孫對此事絕對否認、謂旣不識孫吳氏、又與吳申伯索昧平生、更無包攬如捕房所述之案件、目滬上</p>
<p>與我同名</p>
<p>者極多、焉能斷定所謂之孫少卿卽屬我、且我三十年來素知守法、從未犯案等詞、庭上訪以是否染有鴉片炳嗜好、答、前會吸食、現已戒除、庭上又告以在徐案後援會一案、會有爾參加、孫答不知、錢庭長核供、乃諭本案改期至月之九日下午再訊、</p>

<h3>製紅丸蔽人耳月終日開收音機</h3>

<p>夫婦智識</p>
<h3>不容忽視的婚後衰弱</h3>
<p>……婚後體質衰退的原因及其所蒙弊害的有效挽救法</p>
<p>……縱慾過度能使生隨腺損傷致新陳代謝的機能滯緩</p>
<p>……腎蜀與不孕及發育不全神經衰弱症等的特效療法</p>
<p>結紙在多數人心目中是不可辟免的一回事，所以婚後的健康，實在值得討論和研究。</p>
<p>一般人說：夫婦和諧的主要條件，就是意志和體格。原來的所謂意志，是體格所賦予的一種性質。澈底的一句話，就是體格强壯者，意志純篤。體格孱弱者，意志薄弱。所謂決志完全受體格所支配，所以體格實爲夫婦和好的重要基礎。</p>
<p>如果體弱多病，或腎虧不姙者，往往成爲夫婦間破裂的導線，家庭間就難得圓滿，幸福當然是毫無希望。</p>
<p>一向體質衰弱的，或曾犯過自漬而遺精，那末婚後衰弱的程度，愈呈深刻化。也有的在結婚以前本極健康的，自從進入結婚生活之後，而身體頓告削瘦，同時活氣銷沉，而一毀人類的機能愈弄愈弱，甚到完全喪失！本來結婚是一種快樂的討求，若結婚之後，不特所期待的不曾實現，反於身體有害，這是何等的不幸啊！我們現在來詳細調查這些原因，可得下列的結論：凡是結婚後衰弱之人，除了體質配合的錯誤問題以外，由於性慾放縱者居多，因爲結婚是實現人類機能的開始，若過分放縱，不加抑制，則不知不覺間就把寶貴身體斵傷了，以致成了多病的樣子。結果男子就容易惹起腎虧無能，發育不全，精薄腦弱等症．女子則易使月經不調、乳痛失健，如果體虛過分的結果，帶下也不能避免，姙娠的希望絕難實現。</p>
<p>總之，要掃除這種障磚，不論在婚前婚後，可用堷補青春線（即生殖腺）法，加以根治，頂好在未婚前一發現有遺精毛病，即服希來脫氏固精片”以治之，然後可𪲐婚後的衰弱症象•蓋遺精過久•能使一切陷於衰頹之境。此在遺精症尚未釀成弊害而言，如一旦症象惡化惹成神經衰弱，發育不全，腎虧無能，未老先衰等症後，應服生殖腺素製劑“生殖素”，使衰頹的生殖腺轉弱爲强，一切的機能遂告恢復矣。他若女子的月經不調，婚後不姙，乳前失健，則服女用“生殖素”以治之，如有白帶，可外用“療帶靈”，使女子的膣道潔凈，白帶立愈，則產生健全的子女，方可立待。</p>
<p>健康秘訣</p>
<h3>治療自凟遺精的最新方法</h3>
<p>……根據著名學者的研究證明多數的兒童有自凟的傾向</p>
<p>……矯正自凟必須清心寡慾提高自己的意志則方可戒絕</p>
<p>所謂青年的自凟惡癖，完全是違背生理的一種卑劣舉動，關於它的弊害，我們也無需詳加講解，祇要看“自凟”這兩個字的意義，也就能恍然大悟了。</p>
<p>然而，這種自凟的行爲，任憑醫師及兄長們的苦口婆心勸青年們不要犯上，可是在發育期的男女，差不多耽溺異常，這實在是一種可怕的現象，所以這裏先記其由來，述其毒害，並且揭示如何始克預防矯正的要碲、而敢煩識者加之一考。</p>
<p>根據很多學者的研究，證明兒童百分之七十以上，是有自凟的頃句。最初是八歲至十歲，不過，在這時期，比例還頗少，從十一歲起，便漸次增加。至十五六歲，比列是最多了。幼小時的自凟，能使發育受阻，神經衰弱異常劇烈。而且整個的陷於頻密的遺精恐怖中，所以他未來的幸福，完全於此時葬送</p>
<p>性病專家美國醫學博士紐威爾德氏，及德國名醫曼歐脫博士，英國生理學家勃來登博士等均證明世之患腎虧無能，婚後不姙者，百分之八十於上均爲目凟遺精所促成，因此使人體最重要的生殖腺萎弱失健，結果康健無望，故治療之法，應服“希米脫氏固精片”以止遺精，同時股生殖腺素製劑“生殖素”以拘回因遺精所引起的一切弊害。並且要堅决戒絕自凟，關於目凟的矯正法，最重要者，必須清必寡慾，提高自己的意志，避免不良的接觸，凡此均爲自凟者所宜照辦。</p>
<p>健美指導</p>
<h3>女性乳峯美的成功之路</h3>
<p>……面容上如產生了皺痕也一樣使人討厭此均爲胄春腺早衰之故</p>
<p>……女性如僅僅求容貌之嬌嫩也無濟於事必須有高聳豐腴的乳峯</p>
<p>女性如在成熟期不能獲得良好的發育，則乳房一定萎癟而不能高聳，同時臀部的曲線也不能顯露，這種人當然沒有健美可言。與不能生育的女于一樣悲慘煩惱。</p>
<p>此外最使婦女們憋到悲慘者，爲面容蒼老，皺痕叢生，前者完全影響及於健美，後者是容貌上的浩劫。</p>
<p>一般的女性們，她們現在已經覺悟了，曉得僅僅求容貌的嬌嫩，也無濟於事了。所以必須求身體的健美，以臀部豐腴，曲線畢露方稱無憾！</p>
<p>關於婦女乳癟皺痕的發生，據法國著名的美容專家威泥基博士證實，此完全由於青春腺（即生殖腺）早衰之故，因此影響及於消化器及新陳代謝能力如能服以生殖腺素製劑女用“生殖素”，即能使萎癟的乳房驟然高聳，月經調整，一切均可保持青春常留，中年婦女服之，尤能將面部的皺痕消除•頓成嬌嫩之容顏，女用“生殖素”確具美容上的價值</p>
<h3>最進步的淋病自療法</h3>
<p>淋病爲花柳病中最頑固難治的傳染病，任何人都不能否認。所以難有千百種淋病藥問世，依然不能將淋菌掃除凈絕，不過其中也有的自己錯過治療的時機而變成惡化•也有的因攝養不當，形成緾綿不治之狀•除此之外，則爲誤於醫藥的居多了，因爲淋病如在急性期內能够循正當的途徑治療，不延誤時日，照德國著名的淋病專家活特生博士的治療程序，服以黃色素和伐克辛合製劑“安敵淋”治之，就能很快治好，據博士證實，在臨床實騐記錄中，每二千的淋病患者，完全服“安敵淋”治煎者，竟得一千八百人之譜，病勢减低者約佔百分之二十•因該藥含有抗抵淋菌的菌苗甚多，並具有透膜殺菌的威力，所以能將叢集在泌尿器後段淋病雙球菌，一網打盡，絕基併發病的危險，所有淋病性的睪丸炎，膀胱炎，攝護腺炎等，服此無不立刻痊愈。</p>

<h3>貢獻話策中國國貨聯合營業公司</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>中國國貨聯合營業公司，成立有日矣，目前籌偷上最大之任務，周在招收股欵，顧最急要之工作，厥有三端：</p>
<p>第一為調查各地已成立之國貨公司內容何若？營業何若？何種貨物為繁銷？何種貨物為滯銷？地方人士對其感想何若？此後應改進之處何若？次為各地之國貨產銷狀况，可以設立國貨公司否？地方合作社之辦理如何？能否與之聯絡？凡此均為籌備工作上應行注意之點。</p>
<p>第二為設計就調查之所得，始從車於設針某地宜先設，某地宜次設，某地應如何營業，資本若干，地點何在，如何着手籌備，如何聯絡該地人土，如何與金融界切實合作，此為設計上之初步。</p>
<p>第三為推行今後國貨之區域，日廣一日，推行工作，萬不可少，應派定專員，從車接洽，分赴各地，切實聯絡。或藉報紙宣傳，或取演講，或座談方式，務使國貨聯營事業，深入內地，家喻戶曉無遠勿屆，使內地之產品，與外地之產品，相互溝通，呼成一氣，實收聯繫機構之功能。</p>
<h3>希望於“公務員國貨年”者</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>我們許多努力國貨運動的團體，是已經公定了今年為“公務員國貨年”，並且，已在積極籌備，卽將啟露它的序幕，大家的視綫，自然又要集中在前程遠大的本年，懷着更新的充滿前進的希望的。</p>
<p>在這時候，我個人深深地覺得，“空言無用，事重實踐，”這是歷史的明訓，也正是找們今後從事發展國貨的指針，所以，在這裏，我寫下了三個最基本最殷動的希望，能夠在本年內實施和究成。</p>
<p>第一，我希望做今年國貨運動中心的全國公務員，應該義不容辭地一致起來，以身作則，領導全國的民衆，來努力服用國貨，在本年中尤應做到（甲）糾正及肅清國內少數民衆的殘餘崇拜洋貨心理，（乙）倡導社會上各種的提倡國貨運動。</p>
<p>第二，我希望全國的實業界，在今年能够仍本過去埋頭苦幹的精神，和旣定的方針，積極進行，努力倣到海外市塲的開拓，使對外貿易，更有好轉的趨向，和全國國貨聯營公司的成立和擴展，奠下國貨產銷最堅固不㧞的基礎</p>
<p>第三，我希望全國各界的民衆，從今年起能够更深的了解，認清目前我們經濟上國難的嚴重，提倡國貨是我國整個民族生存的問題，大家亟應團結一致，追隨於全國公務員之後，努力國貨運動。</p>
<h3>國貨水泥產量之調查</h3>
<p>— 豹</p>
<p>前見報載“如何鞏固經濟基礎”一文，卓見所及，至深欽佩，惟其中“近來水泥因建築工程需求稍切，不能不求於日貨一語，按諸事實，殊有未符。查我國水泥產銷狀况，现尙供過於求，茲將國內水泥產量開列如左：</p>
<p>以水泥產量而論，實覺過剩，尚無須仰給於進口水泥，以價格言，最近上海工部局標購水泥，外灰標價袋裝，每桶七元三四角，國產標價袋裝，每桶六元一四角，則外貨當不能與國貨抗爭，惟一切物料，市價繼長增高，勢將影響國產水泥之製造成本耳。</p>
<p>水泥之需要，在本年十月以前，尚無特殊激增現象，啟新中國兩廠，均自動减少產額，十月以後，需嬰略增，共間雖值粵局底定，撤消苛捐雜稅之後，運粵貨物擁擠，船隻缺乏，致啟新廠由塘沽輸滬之貨，不無略見遭緩，旋又值外交緊急，運貨車輛，路局未能充分供給，因之龍潭中國廠，貨運亦稍受阻礙，近經各該廠之努力，早經佚復原狀，照常供貨矣，故國產水泥現在並不缺乏，誠恐外界誤會，用特不憚辭費，表而出之，聊供國貨商事調查之一助。</p>
<h3>機製國貨陳列所觀感</h3>
<p>— 張巴玲</p>
<p>江海關所主辦的“機製國貨物品陳列所一，已於一月二十四日開幕了。在這產業落後的國家、機製工業幼稚得異常可憐，而外貨的進口，仍佔着相當鉅大的情况之下，江海關方面，能够收集各國貨工廠的機製出品，來大量的展覽一下，公開的給一般民衆以認識的機會，藉以知道我國機製國貨品進步的程度，進而引起他服用國貨的决心，這未始不是一件沒有價值沒有意義的事。</p>
<p>陳列所是設在江海關的三樓上，地位是相當的寬大，筆者在前天的上午，抽暇去參觀了一次，所得觀感很佳，現摘要寫述於次：</p>
<p>除此之外，如新申紗廠的紗樣和花樣，佈置也很可愛；公動鐵廠的各種洋釘，裝成一幅美麗的風景畫，更是難能。</p>
<p>其他各種磁品，玻璃製品，麻製品，絲織品，橡膠製品，針織品，羊毛織品，化學藥品，罐製品，化妝品，妝飾品，各種機械等等，陳列得五光十色，在在給予觀衆一個良好的印象，認爲咱們中國的機製國貨物品，經過了生產界的努力，現在已經有了長足的進步了。</p>
<p>在歸途上，筆者默默的想着：這次江海關所主辦的機製國貨物品陳列所，是有重大的意義的。希望自從此次公關陳列以後，弘起一般人對於國貨的認識，進而增加他們提倡和服用的興趣。</p>
<p>這次江海關所徵求的機製國貨物品，種類很多，不下六七千種，而參加的國貨工廠，也有七百餘家之多，的確是一個大規模的展覽會，陳列的物品，最令人注意的，便是建設委員會的各式電器，電爐，電扇，發民機等，式樣是非常美觀的，在每一件物品的上面，都黏有說明書，說明原料的來源，使用的方法，出售的價格，使參觀的人，無形中可以增加若干的電學常識。其次便是各式玩具，如飛禽走獸，飛機，防毒面具，坦克車，汽車等，構造也很精巧，和舶來品比較，有過之無不及，這神玩具，多爲康元廠出品，是够提高兒童的智識，啟發兒童的思想，增加兒童研究國防問題的趣味，也是很有意義的。</p>
<p>除此之外，如新申紗廠的紗樣的花樣，佈置也很可愛；公勤鐵廠的各種洋釘，裝成一幅美麗的風景，更是難能。</p>
<h3>推銷淺說（三）</h3>
<p>— 定凱</p>
<p>這裏且來介紹一些因為連用心理而致勝利的䡍聞。</p>
<p>美國福特公司的營業主任。對於客戶信用的辨別。是有一種特殊的心得。他任職閱十餘年。日常的工作，多半清耗在接見買主。或訪晤客戶。對於交易上的記帳或現售，不但負有完全的責任，而且耍隨時加以果斷，他一方面憑藉着客戶信用的調查，另一方面却從與客人握手的一瞬機會裏，去辨別這買客的信用好壤，他還把手掌的“大而硬“小而硬“大而軟”……等。做成一項很有趣味的記錄，據稱這種辨別力是科學的。而且不大錯的，因已從十餘年的經騐並十數萬人的握手經騐中得之。</p>
<p>日本有一家松下雜貨食品店，其女店主“三知夜”，夙負能名，她對於每天清晨進門的許多主婦，總是和藹地去招待，或帮助店員去應接，她又常常對店員說着，“假如來臨的主婦，今天衣服是突然有些刺激性了，而髮結還好像整理得似一半兒地，走進門的時候，又是那樣地急忙，面部雖未及施着胞紛，却現出快活的微笑，我們就應該勸她多買一些魚肉蔬菜，或一格雞，因經騐告訴我們，這是那位主婦家有佳客的表現了。”</p>
<p>英國的倫梯立公司，是歐洲負盛名的糖果界巨擘，當該公司“黑幻術巧克力”在發行的先前，决定舉行一次市塲的分析，他們把各種不問的口味，去廣做一般人嘗試，再拿包裝方面的顏色配合，也同時徵求於大衆博訪周諮後的結果，這黑幻術巧克力，果然得了發行上驚人的成功。</p>
<h3>述許屈熿女士提倡國貨之根本辦法（續第二○一期）</h3>
<p>— 林文女士</p>
<p>㊃希望聯合玫商廠設各國貨諮詢所，該所設諮詢部，（包合函詢而詢兩種），設計部，郵售部，電話購貨部•諮詢部以資一般不知辦認國貨之眞偽者函詢與面詢。設計部担任代人設計，譬如各省市婦女訂購國貨服裝，只要寫明尺寸，并說明擬花錢若干，該部卽代其設計挑選原料，製就限期由郵寄去，似此旣可着實提倡國貨，且能予人以便利，未始非推廣國貨之捷徑。郵售部專管郵寄，惟選擇物品，須以愼重為主，以昭信用。電話購貨部，送貨以靈捷爲上。（按此事三友實業社已實行）</p>
<p>㊄希望中國國貨公司設法出一種競買獎勵證（此證可印一些簡明的警句，以促醒犬衆），於訪問時，送給各家庭。此種獎勵證，可於每次購物時帶到該公司登記。每季或每年檢查一次，購貨最易者（可分一名二名三名…），可予以紀念獎勵品。此種辦法，較之奉送各種戲院代價劵尤有價值。天津國貨售品所，運用此法，收效甚鉅，上海市更可探行，以得提倡！</p>
<p>㊅希望各國貨廠商，設法造就專門人材，譬如現時之國產顏料，尚未有精良適用之出品，以致無論何種布疋，不退色者顏料均須仰給外洋，各廠商則應設法搪塞此多量漏巵，培植此種人材。各廠商以每年盈餘中提出數成爲輔助費，使其他日學成歸國，有最大之貢獻，服務於本廠。</p>
<p>㊆最好國貨公司能遍設小規模的分公司於各條馬路上。上海之大，專勢上不能使人每購一物必須跑到大陸商塲去。分設這些小商店，以便一般附近顧客之購買。多備日常用品，以便吸收普通人之購買力，且能養成他們愛用國貨之習慣。不然一般省事的人，總不免疏忽小處，而隨意去購買便宜的洋貨。</p>
<p>許女士是一位富有經騐思想前進的婦人。她一向是樂用國貨的，在天津時爲之用國貨曾感受過許多困難，和一般親友的議諷，而她决堅持者數十年如一日的態度的澈底精神！女同胞們，你們要曉得女人旣不能效命疆塲，你們最大的責任便是：在家庭中敎育子女，使其將來能爲國效勞；而對於社會國家的任務，便是要肩起這輕而易舉的提倡國貨，樂用國貨的責任？大家只要具着大公無私的精神，每當購用一物時，必想到錢之去處，不要把私囊中之一分一毫銀錢，隨便的買洋貨，同時你可以至誠愛用國貨的態度，於購物時詢問店員，一面注意商標。那麼他們絕對不會不忠實的回答你的。而每年的入超問題，自然可由大家的同心恊力來打破了？</p>
<h3>婦女服用國貨會的回憶（下）</h3>
<p>— 劍花</p>
<p>但是，那次的會塲情形。所給予我的印象太“差”了。那天的秩序是混亂的，人聲是嘈雜的，臺上講演的諸先生，雖然聚精會神地說的臉也紅了。嗓也啞了。聽者還是談她們的。笑她們的，投票選舉時，也不管主席在說明和指導，大家只胡亂圈了幾個名字，投入票匭，自動的去領贈品了，當領贈時，大家爭先恐後，傾軋擁擠，以致貨號誤調，無從核對，乃有聲言不妨隨意拿走者，使辦事人左右為難，無所措手，此種情形，不一而足。把牠歸納起來，似不外乎下列兩點㊀婦女太忽略精神㊁婦女太重視物質。</p>
<p>關於第一點，我希望女子們，以後在此種國貨運動集會的塲會裏（因國貨運動，卽言國貨運動，其實任何集會，均應如是）第一“莊嚴肅穆”“沉默鎮靜”非有意見發表，勿自由談論，非有重要事故，勿自動離席，選舉投票，須依照主席指示之方法舉行，猶要認清被選者是否選當其任。</p>
<p>關於第二點，凡屬贈品，多數是由各方熱心徵募得來，辦事人員，義務担任支配，受贈的人對此意外收獲，母得認為應有之利益，得之固然可喜，失之亦無所怨，領贈時，尤應須序挨號，俾無錯誤，一方面免使辦事者為難，一方面免為有識者竊笑，</p>
<p>以上二點，作者根據當時事實，特地提出，請我婦女界，加以深省，至於那時雖也有許多人，頗能遵守秩序，如上述情形者，不過居其少數，但仍希望大家，“有則改之，無則加勉”。</p>

<p>西青甲組排球、自上週海青不愼慘敗於俄軍後、對極有把握之錦標、竟發生動摇、使曾敗俄軍之西青隊、大有後來居上之勢、昨晚海青與西青相逢、如海青能否有蟬聯錦標之關鍵、亦爲海青本屆命運之最終决定、中西觀衆、亦頗有眼光、預料此賽之必具精彩、故集而作壁上觀者、無慮數百、西青因有猛將泊洛可飛夫之助陣、聲勢極形煊赫、交鋒不久、西青即節節佔先、九比六後、極迅捷已增至十四、海青奮力掙扎、終被西青以十五比十、先勝首局、二局開始、海青漸復常態、一舉即下六分、未幾、西青亦連獲四分、追至四比六、此後海青純以鄭亦泉之汗馬殊勛、每能以兩易一、故比數即加至八比四、十比五、以至十三比六、詎西青又一度追至九比十三、頗具聲勢、迨十一比十四後、大局漸見安定、無如西青困獸猶鬥、又增兩分、幸鄭亦泉劈殺成功、始以十五比十一扳回、而以各二平分秋色、轉危爲安、最後决勝局、海青先勝兩分、嗣後即成各二各三以至各四、進展極見平均、四四以後、海青一鼓作氣、勢如破竹、十比四時、西青叫停、以避其鋒、迨至十三比四後、西青峯廻路轉、復見活躍、增至九比十三後、雙方爭奪開球權至久、終爲海青增上一分、成十四比七、西青雖有餘力、但於再加一分後、終被麥炳堯斜裏猛劈、以八比十五連失、海青則倖以二對一反敗爲勝、惟局勢驚駭、延長原定時刻達半小時以上、海青從此祗須於第二循環申加以努力、則盟主一席、仍有厚望也、另塲俄軍以直落二勝蘇壳爾、局勢一面倒、成績如下、</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>美棉與三品暴騰</p>
<p>紗花漲力薄弱</p>
<p>紗錠漸增存紗不易出淸</p>
<p>棉産過剩地頭尚未運罄</p>
<p>同業心思因之看低</p>
<p>紗市晨漲午回、形勢稍見錯雜不一、良以目前多數目標觀跌、因各廠錠子開足、生産必增、紗布倉庫存紗一時不易全部出淸、因此　月棉賣甚夥、壓力重重、但海外棉業情形漸入佳境、大阪三品紗漲風鋭利、遠月均漲五元半至六元半、然本埠人心未受若何影響也、</p>
<p>標沙漲後又遭壓廹標紗前市開盤、各月呈飛漲之象、氣勢甚形俏俐、因海外棉業狀况一致轉趨高翔、人心未免激昂、大阪三品紗各月均漲三元九角至四元九角、迨至三收盤、聞紗銷不旺、在五六百包之間、空方又來襲擊、拍至遠月復跌、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均漲六·七角至一元三角、午後開盤、市情軟弱、各月下挫、氣勢不振、多説現紗交易不暢、祗成交九百包、徐某又來賣出、但三品紗歩歩前進、至收盤時略形回上、結果各月比上午收盤價均跌一·三·五·七角、查賣出裕大六千七百五十包、通記五百五十包、達記九百包恒德一千包、仁豐一千二百五十包、頥大九百五十包、同和一千七百包、買進瑞大一千包、吉豐六百五十包、同孚八百五十包、恒益二千八百包、錦昌一千一百包、賡豐二千八百五十包、大昌成一千一百五十包、長豐二千○五十包、潤康一千一百包、永大三千二百包、信誠七百包、生源七百包、</p>
<p>現紗售價參差不定</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、但較前爲少、查全日各帮買去統計九百○八包、售價參差不定、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>棉市稍堅、但同業心理一致看低、因內地存棉　未運罄、預料今年有過剩之虞、故逢漲時抛賣者尚不乏人也、壓廹殊重、但姜棉連漲數日、氣勢順利、遠月穿出一角二分關口矣、</p>
<p>標花近遠漲　　角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月一律上昇、目漲風劇烈、良以美棉續漲遠期漲破　角二分關口、印棉亦平静、人心稍昂、但入後同　鑒於國內存棉充足、看跌心思奇濃、迨至收盤時、各月復跌矣、標花結果各月　十日收盤價　漲五分至一角半、午後開盤、各月上下不一、市塲交易不旺、相買者缺乏、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一二角、查賣出大孚一千擔、恒益一千九百擔、明德二千擔合興二千擔、泰興一千　擔、元一一千一百擔、益昶一千一百擔、恊成一千三百擔、同和一千六百擔、長和二千九百擔、大豐二千一百擔、森康二千五百擔、申大三千四百擔、仁豐三千二百擔、長豐一千五百擔、買進梅記三千七百擔、泰昌三千七百擔、潤康七千五百擔、益康三千九百擔、新昶三千一百擔、吉豐一千四百擔、元一一千七百擔、恊成二千四百擔、永大一千三百擔、</p>
<p>現棉日廠進意稍動</p>
<p>現棉淸淡平凡、但日廠鑒於美棉歩升、進意稍動矣、來源未見云、</p>
<p>多歟！空歟！</p>
<p>紗花買賣雙方之見解如是</p>
<p>邇來標凖紗花市况、因二月期紗印商一派擁軋空頭以後、各方交出現紗、超出三萬包以外、多頭雖努力收受、然市氣受其打擊矣、同時大阪三品紗市傾向下落、一度曾跌破二百四十元關口、於是空方殊形活躍、聲勢雄壯、三月期跌風獨熾、遠月較爲和緩、實則多方高抬已久、一旦得遇機會、當然有一度下瀉之象、目前市塲上多空兩方、見仁見智、各有不同、空方鑒於四方紗廠添錠、趕工製造、且倉庫存紗已囤積在三萬包左右、各廠生産之紗、亦有餘剩之虞、因此傾向抛賣、至於多方、因時期尚在春銷旺檔之際、目前棉紗廠方仍無存積、所以現紗集中在紗布倉庫中、一旦客銷生意起色、躉批現紗仍向所中購辦、且市價比上年歳暮收盤價已跌近十元矣、故多空兩方、競爭劇烈也、不過現紗交易依然呆滯無勁、但三品紗顯著轉機向升之象、美棉趨勢暗淡已久、忽見光明上漲、如果再繼續前進、本棉當能受其牽制、但上海存棉尚充足、約有七八十萬擔之譜、西北等處亦源源而來、壓力未减也、查標紗近月比去年收盤價跌五元六角、遠跌四元六角、標花平平云、</p>
<p>各種物料漲價</p>
<p>美棉業購意甚濃</p>
<p>現貨更爲有力：遠期出二分關</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、利物浦消息良好、外商同業、經紀商及紐奥崙等買進、各月漲三至六磅音、套賣及多頭獲利了結之額、均爲吸收、利物浦方面差益巨大、現棉有力、世界消費擴張、以及其他各種物料漲　、鼓起同業興味不少、而業外見西南棉區乾燥、政府統制新棉益嚴、買進新棉之興味更濃、收盤時大衆購買、市勢極堅、計現貨漲十六磅音、期貨漲十至二十一磅音、英棉現貨漲四點、期貨漲七點、印棉初因國外消息利於買方、投機新户買進、及空户抵補而漲、後因套賣及多頭了結而疲、計平果爾漲○·五至○·七五羅比、奥姆辣跌○·二五羅比、白羅溪漲○·二五羅比、原雷錄左、（一日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二日開盤預測、白羅溪爲二百二十八羅比、奥姆辣爲二百○九羅比半、漲二·二五羅比、平果爾爲一百八十二羅比半、漲二羅比、</p>
<p>三品紗花上漲有力、</p>
<p>二日大版電、現紗漲一元至跌十元、十六支扇面二百二十六元、漲一元、二十支金魚二百四十五元、不動、四十支五星三百六十五元、跌十元、四十二支雉子三百六十元、不動、三品期紗漲五元一角至六元五角、近月爲二百四十二元一角、遠月爲二百四十六元一角、期棉漲九角至一元三角五分、近月爲七十五元五角五分、遠月爲七十七元五角五分、</p>
<p>上週蘭貢輸出棉花量</p>
<p>一日孟買電、上週自蘭貢方面輸出之棉花數量、共二三六噸、內至神户者一九六噸、至安體活者二二噸、至利物浦者一八噸、</p>

<p>昨棉市市况午前因青島市盤轉跌、東疋白貨甚形軟弱、又以天津帮將未裝運之細布細斜轉手吐出、同業心思益虚、細布降落（每疋）五分左右、細斜無大變更、本街批發莊進意仍佳、續有吸納、細布成交有五六百件、同業字號心思看高者、訂購現期貨細布如龍頭·五福·陽鶴·花鳥·吉祥等牌亦達五百餘件、後市聞青島電報紗漲五元外、疋頭亦復回升、細布售盤與前日相等、市氣驟轉堅穩、各廠條素府綢、絲光藍布、津帮長江帮及本街均有採辦、以麗明廠之黎明圖綫府綢、及一千五百號之頭號藍布走銷最盛云、</p>
<h3>金融</h3>
<p>純金回小標金形勢反穩</p>
<p>金市昨初以海外銀市升降俱微、而不一致、滙兑續升、倫敦生金跌半便士、中央銀行掛牌揭曉英美俱平、海關金單位勿動、標凖標金價降爲一一五七元一角、農開平盤、開後買户較盛、而趨穩、入後遂呈爲持之局、而鮮變化、今將一天市况誌後、</p>
<p>晨開爲一一五五元半、與前收同價、恒餘大成同豐餘納條、滙豐掛牌英美俱平、以及白銀平衡税勿動、逐漸升至五元七角、元茂永趁高售條、退至五元六角、恒昌永趁勢維持、午收仍爲一一五五元七角、</p>
<p>後市開盤一一五五元七角、恒昌永進條、恒餘生源永則賣、大勢掙扎、收盤爲一一五五元七角、一天間祗有二角上落、結果微升二角、</p>
<p>結價以中央銀行標凖標金價、退爲一一五七元一為角、照收盤價言約撳一元餘、現貨市况平静、天津貨照加十四元、洽赤賣價十五元、買價十一元、均乏對做、</p>

<p>輔幣兑價仍形參差</p>
<p>兑換率可以説：</p>
<p>自南而北</p>
<p>由高而低</p>
<p>南市兑二九七○文</p>
<p>等於一分幣九九枚</p>
<p>銅元兑價，在舊曆之歳尾年首，最低曾至二千八百二十文，（即二月中旬前後）自過元宵節後，兑價日長，蓋中間亦有一段事實，即中銀行以兑換一分銅幣之事務，委託於烟兑業，但舊銅元之兑價，雖有牽掣，而仍不能使兩者間之兑價，相劑於平、。至最近數日，漸有齊平之望。如南市銅元兑價，每法幣一元，可兑二千九百七十文，即等於一分輔幣九十九枚、非相等而何。甚至可兑二千九百八十文者，則反多兑十文矣。</p>
<p>上海輔幣兑價，至不整一，然亦有一相似之規儰，可云「自南而北，由高而低，」此雖爲歸納之説，然大旨不甚相遠。即以最近之銅元兑價而言，在法租界毘連南市者，兑價在二千九百七十文及二千九百五十文之間，而以二千九百五十文爲多數，及法租界北部接近英租界之處，漸與英租界兑價相近，在二千九百四五十文之間。自入英租界，兑價自二千九百四十文至二千九百二十文之間、最低乃有二千九百文，此則爲絶少數。</p>
<p>雙毫兑價，最高如南市一帶，一元可兑十角四百七八十文，自此而降，有兑十角四百五十，四十，三十，亦有兑十角四百二十文，則亦爲絶少數。</p>
<p>至於雙毫兑銅元自四百八十文至四百五十文，有一家竟可兑五百文，此亦爲難得遇見者。</p>
<p>先令結欵旺盛</p>

<h3>所得税申報表類之編製法（一）</h3>
<p>— 潘士浩</p>
<p>民國十年間，政府擬推行所得税，上海銀行公會所主辦之銀行週報、出所得税問題專號以主張之。當是時，愚適參與該週報編輯事務，曾從調節社會經濟之立塲上，亦爲文以示提倡，於今蓋已十五六年矣。嗣後屢欲推行，屢無成就，直至最近，始由國民政府實行也。推行良税，以調節社會經濟且以紓國家財政之困難，實爲一可喜之事。惟所得税之計算，及申報之手續，非常繁瑣，一有不週，窒礙隨之。近來工商業對於各種申報表類之未能如期造報，正爲不明塡記手續之故。爰就個人見解所及，説明各種申報表類之編製塡記方法，藉爲工商業稍釋困難，而爲推行所得税之一助。惟是僅於公餘之暇，枝枝節節以爲之，疏漏之處，自所難免。如蒙讀者指正，尤所企盼。</p>
<p>（一）行號報告表</p>
<p>依所得税暫行條例施行細則第四十六條之規定，公司·商號·行棧·工廠·及營利之個人，應於本細則施行日起一個月內、將姓名·住址·營業·資本或股本實額，報明當地主管徵收機關。行號報告表，非公司組織之商號，行棧，工廠，及營利之個人，報告上開事項所用之表也。其行棧工廠等之屬於公司組織者，應另用公司報告表以報告之。兹説明本　應塡報之事項如左：</p>
<p>（一）名稱　凡商號·行棧·工廠·及營利之個人，必有其一定之名稱。例如華新木器號，景泰德米行，大陸染織廠，裕大恊記號等是也。應於表中「名稱」「行號」之地位，依據事實，完全塡人之。其已爲商號之登記者，及商標執照中之塡有商號之名稱者。本表中所塡之名稱，應與之相同。本表雖稱行號報告表，而照施行細則第四十六條之規定，其應用之範圍，固不限於「行」與「號」，凡「棧」「廠」等類，亦適用之。</p>
<p>（二）負責人姓名　負責人者，對於繳納所得税應負責任之人也。依理而言，當即爲行號之經恊理，廠長，及號主等。塡寫時應塡明其職位及姓名。依施行細則第二十七條之規定，所得税之繳納方法，屬於第一類營利事業所得之甲項及乙項所得者（即繼續營利所得），由業務負責人自行繳納。屬於第一類丙項所得及第二類薪給報酬所得，第三類證劵存欵所得者，以由支付機關之業務負責人代爲扣繳爲原則，其第一類丙項所得及第二類所得之無支付機關　　主者，始由納税義務人或其代理人自行繳納。本表所塡之負責人，當與此種業務負責人具有同樣性質。盵䈐細則第四十六條，雖未明定須申報負責人姓名。但行號應有其一定之負責人，本表列此爲應申報之事項，自屬合理。（未完）</p>

<h3>環境</h3>
<p>— （醉樵）</p>
<p>環境它好比是一枚炸彈的外表鐵皮，人們就是它裏面包藏的火藥，假使這枚炸彈不去推動它一下，讓它靜悄悄地擱在那兒，於是那富有强烈性的火藥，便不能發展它所具的特長來，等於一個人處在安適的環境裏，什麼一切一切，他都不愿意去幹了，同時他也辜負了人生在社會上所負的一種偉大的責任：所以我們需要惡環境來搖撼我們，使我們奮鬥的精神，爆炸出雄壯的火花，盡我們做人的天職！</p>
<p>可是有很多青年們，他們都對惡環境加以仇視；同時也誤會了對惡環境奮鬥的正旨，於是背道而馳，他們喊著：“我們要跳出惡劣環境，去找我們新的途徑！”那就像不善用炸彈者，反炸毀了自己！其實新的途徑，是應由我鬥在惡環境下，不畏艱苦，努力向前，而後才可達到目的呢！</p>
<p>比如我們要到某一個地方去，但中途必須經過一段沙漠地，假使我們覺到沙漠地不良於行，那麼目的地再也不會達到了！我們要得到那兒，就得奔過這一段沙漠地；說是繞道去吧，第一誤了時日，第二不免易入歧途，等着懊悔也來不及了！</p>
<p>這裏我們做人有個緊要的關論：就是“求己”和“信己，求己，惟有自己是最可靠的輔助者：信己，不會受到任何騙欺與誘惑，那麼我們也可很敏捷地跑上成功之路上</p>
<h3>友朋節雜感</h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>今天三月三日，便是友朋節，“友朋節”這個名詞，從來也沒有聽見說過。那曉得他的創始，到現在已經有了四個年頭。</p>
<p>首創的就是萬友園主交際博士黃警頑先生：這個玩意兒，除了他老先生，可也沒有旁人去做。</p>
<p>什麼道理呢？</p>
<p>因爲除了他，別人誰配稱萬友園主呢？</p>
<p>聽他老先生對我說：</p>
<p>“我的一生全靠朋友帮助我，並且我也是吃的朋友底飯，假使沒有朋友的話，那我也沒有飯吃了！我現在的朋友眞是算不清有多少！大概不下二十餘萬人”。</p>
<p>我們聽了他的話，覺得果然是不錯。可是我們所交的朋友，好的一個也找不到，弄到末了總是自己吃虧。我個人就是上過朋友的大當！可見得在社會上最難得的便是知心的朋友。</p>
<p>照這樣說，我們是不要交朋友了，不，一個人怎能夠不要朋友哩？我們看着頑先生編的那本“社交拾得”裏面，也有一段說他自己也是遇到一位壞朋友。</p>
<p>朋友在今日，的確是不可少的，但是我們對於朋友始終用“敬”“愛”二字去做，人非草木，總可以得到朋友的帮助！我們只要照聖人說的那句話：“三人行，必有我師焉。”去做就行了。</p>
<p>所以女朋節的產生，是我們最需要的，不僅是爲了增加相互間的友誼，也是恢復我們中國固有的道德。</p>
<h3>“差不多”</h3>
<p>— 焦士潔</p>
<p>其實，一個人無論做那一件事，總須有個確定，說一是一，說二是二，總不要那邊幾個人”？“差不多七八個”。這種“差不多”的回答，是不肯定的回答，容我來講二個事實給各位聽。</p>
<p>姓黃的是某某字號裏的一位帳房先生，他專歡喜說“差不多”，一天晚上，經理走來問黃先生：“今天的帳上怎麼樣？銀錢有無多少？”黃先生回說：“差不多，帳上銀錢差不多。”經理再問他：“到底多呢？少呢？還是剛好呢？”他還是一連串的“差不多”：後來，經理自己說：“我剛才乘車子，因車錢未帶，向帳裏宕二角車錢，現在還在帳內。”於是黃先生又說：“這樣才是差不多呢！”</p>
<p>還有一個唸別字的李先生，信奉佛學，常唸經茹素，有一次，他對人說：“這三天我又要“齊戒沐浴了。”大家聽他不懂，以爲他在講什麼玄妙的佛學呢。後來他却把字寫了出來，原來是“齋戒沐浴”四字、這才引得大家哈哈大笑，他紅起了臉，大家再問他：“齋”與“齊”是否相同？他說：“那不是‘差不多’嗎？有什麼好笑呢！”</p>
<p>諸位看了上面二件故事，可以知道那些不能肯定和明知而不肯自認錯的人，他們决不能得人信仰，雖然他們總是以“差不多”三字來推諉，然面在有的時俟，卽使說“差不多”見無可推諉的。請再看下面一則趣事：</p>
<p>張王李郭四人，恰巧會在一處，對义麻雀又都有同嗜，於是立刻入局，义起麻雀來。事前講明，“和”錯要包的，也都通過，幾圈過後，張先生連碰帶吃，以“六索”“九筒”二對待“和”，王先生打一“九索”，張先生隔河呌“和”，一看，却是“九索”，當然“和”錯，於是大家要張先生包錢，張光生說：“六索”“九索看起來不是差不多嗎？這不能算我”“和”錯。但是其餘三人，不因爲他差不多一而罷事，結果，非得由張先生掏出包錢了事。</p>
<p>由此可以知道，卽使狡滑而說“差不多”，有時也推諉不去責任，所以無論做那一件事，總不要存“差不多”的心理，凡事都得負起責任的去做。肯定地的說。</p>

<h3>換巢鸞凰</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝　秋光黯翠黛觸景書懷夢）</p>
<p>蘭正襟坐着，向二少奶正色道：二嫂，你今天所說的這些話，是母親叫你來通知我的呢？還是你自已無心中露出來的呢？二少奶臉上，表示了驚訝之色，兩手同時搖着道：我的妹妹，這話就這樣一說了罷。不但母親沒有叫我把話告訴你。而且還叮嘱過我們，不許把這件事傳到你耳朶裏來。這也並無別意。不過怕你聽着，又要無緣無故的發愁。你是不知道，你若有什麼憂愁的樣子，母親看到了，就不免四處打聽，到底爲了什麼。這一件事，明知道你聽了是不順心的，還有些日子呢，他肯老早的就告訴你嗎？妹妹，你是個聽明人，什麼不知道。大槪你讀的書本子，比我們所認識的字還多，我們有那樣大的膽，敢到你面前耍什麼花槍。好妹妹，我們這話，一說一了，就到這裏爲止，不必再提了。他說着話，並且站了起來，表示他誠惶誠恐，不敢負責的樣子。夢蘭靠了桌沿站定，微咬了下嘴唇，眼睛看了自己的鞋尖，十指交叉，放在懷裏，只管的出神。二少奶道：妹妹，你怎麼了？我只勸你不發愁，你還是老要發愁。夢蘭歡了一口氣道：無論是誰，到了我這個境遇裏面，也不能不發愁吧？二少奶兩脚輕輕在樓板上一頓道：喲！那是我的話說錯了。夢蘭搖搖手道：不，我揣情度理，老早的也就明白了。好比那死囚牢裏的犯人，雖然不知道那天去上刑場，可是心裏頭雪亮，知道盡頭的日子是不遠。二少奶聽他把話說得這樣的嚴重，不由得把臉紅了起來。夢蘭道二嫂，你以爲我這話說得太厲害嗎？我以爲這才是心窩裏要說的話呢。你索興告訴我，到底是那個日子？二少奶苦笑着道：我說了，你倒苦逼我。夢蘭斟了一杯茶，右宇舉着，送到口邊，左手却托了右手臂的肘拐，呷一口茶，向一天花板上看一眼，把那荼都喝完了，然後點了两點頭。二少奶笑道：二妹，你也覺的我所顧慮的不錯嗎？（一四○）</p>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<h3>弘寂大師</h3>
<p>— 朱承熙</p>
<p>查猛濟先生，聽說他四年前出了家，法名弘寂大師。雖然他邊在法學院和建國中學担任國學的敎授。</p>
<p>我跟他分别好多年了，這次，我顺便去訪問他。</p>
<p>室裏充滿一股檀香的香味，香烟在佛像前繚繞，大師默默地在編着法學院的國學講義。</p>
<p>“查老師，還認識吧！”他把我仔細端詳了一會，居然說：“朱承熙吧！我記得！”</p>
<p>閑坐了一會，找想跟他討論爲什出家的問題，我提出了許多的疑問，但他總是笑笑不答！站起來添香，又把磬子“叮”的敵了一下。</p>
<p>“我們談談吧！”他開始問起我的生活來，我胡亂的跟他對答着，獨沒有談到“出家”，沒有談到“佛”，也許俗人不配談佛的！</p>
<p>我開始流覽這佛堂又兼辦公室又兼寢室的屋子，壁上掛着許多佛的畫像和聯語，正中有“歸元無二路，方便有多門”一聯，是大師自己的手筆，靠窗口桌上供着佛像，點着香，安置着木魚磬子等法器，疊着“楞枷阿跋多羅實經”等經書，地上又有一個蒲團，據說是大師打坐和早晚做功課的地方。</p>
<p>另有一角，縣着他慈母的遺像，邊上還黏着一張紅紙，有“貴賓至此，懇辭頂禮”八個大字，盥洗處又有“以水洗面當願衆生得凈法門永無垢染”諸字。</p>
<p>我正在一一注視，忽地袁業裕先生拿着一疊書走進來，他也是我過去的老師，又問長問短的關切得很，那時，大師忽然指着桌上一個大餅對袁先生說：“這大餅還是暑假裏吃剩在那裏的，你看，不霉，也不壞。”袁先生說：“唷！差不多有三四個月了，這是信佛的奇蹟！否則，老鼠也把他吃掉了！”停了一會，大師又說：“我想永久放在那裏，看三年後成個什麼樣子！”接着，三個人現了個會心的微笑！</p>
<p>臨行，煩大師給題上幾個字，他用筆隨手寫着。“無有衆苦，但受諸樂，於此世間，諸出世法。”</p>
<p>到家，翻着弘寂大師編贈的“報恩與出家”和“遮斷食肉法門”，實在想不出查老夫于所以出家的原因。記得一二八以前，我們的母校“建國中學”還在沈聯芳的“止園”內的時候，查老夫子有二點是很引起同學們注意的，一是他的學問廣博，他懂日文，英文，法文，又是一個世界語者，房間裏的桌上，几上，架上，床上，甚之地上，都滿堆着各種文字各種性質的書，另有一是他很和女同學們接近，記得一次國文課上，他高誦着女同學周耿萱的詩：“背着槍，負着劍，衝過了陣綫，我想念着的他呀！險啊險！查大師怕還不會一點印像都沒有吧？</p>
<p>然而他畢竟出家了，他的法名是弘寂大師。</p>
<h3>衆星集蘇追記</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>星社去年中秋重陽除夕三次雅集，均在上海舉行，靜好樓持鰲賞菊，蘇州方面社友到者亦甚少。此次蘇州圖書館舉辦吳中文獻展覽會時，因館長蔣吟秋亦是社友，故與幹事范烟橋君商議，定於二月二十一日，在蘇州舉行。是日係星期，上海各社友可以抽暇，一舉兩得，衆皆贊同。予於先一日前往，次日偕內了吳松如曁四兒參觀吳中文獻展覽會時，遇本刊主編瘦鵑先生及蔣館長，據云天雖下雨，上海方面陶冷月鄭逸梅徐碧波江紅蕉趙眼雲諸君仍來，且鎭江易君左君亦趕到，席設對門滄浪亭面水軒，范烟橋君已在招待，故卽前往。少頃，范佩萸周克讓范君博程瞻廬范菊高徐澐秋柳君然吳待秋陳迦　顧墨畦樊少雲趙子雲諸君絡繹來，有久別重逢者，有素係神交者，相聚一堂，不勝歡慰。烟橋出小冊，請題詞以留鴻雪，君左題詩時，冷月適在旁，故所題之七絕內，除寫景外，又將烟橋冷月四字嵌入，才思敏捷，苟非老手，曷克臻此。在美術學校門前攝影時，顧明道患足疾而獨坐，蔣吟秋因事冗而晚到，衆皆比顧爲張靜江，稱蔣日委員長。予日：美術學校建築雄壯，堪與中央黨部媲美，不知者確將疑影中人爲黨國要人，日二十八係星宿數，本社以星命名，今日到會人數，適二十八，可稱天然湊合。衆皆軒渠。入席後，烟橋先請各人依次起立而介紹，俾衆認識其面目，繼因碧波吟秋紅蕉君左四君今年均四十歲，故請全體起立，合敬一杯，以表慶祝。予謂今日之會，頗不易，已攝之影，請君博添曬，由烟橋將各人姓名，按共所立地位，依次塡入，則素未謀面諾君，見影卽知，不必再問尊姓大名，且應仿照右軍蘭亭修楔辦法，推一人撰序，以留記念，瘦鵑主另繪一圖，結果公推君左撰序，在座畫家各繪一圖，裱成手卷，由各人親題數字，珍藏於蘇州省立圖書館中。予日：然則三百年後再開吳小文獻展覽會時，此卷亦當視爲拱璧，可以供後人賞覽矣。後君左分贈其所撰關於發揚民族之各種歌詞及半月刊，烟橋請其卽席高歌，渠謂祇能填譜撰詞，而不善唱，有一盲友擅音樂，情此次未同來耳。至三時餘，始盡歡而散。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>世間男子均糊塗</h3>
<p>— 我</p>
<p>前報載：張學良夫婦廿六日晨十時，偕鄧士萍等過甬，遊天童育王等名勝，晚六時卽返溪口，眞是無官一身輕，想見賢伉儷優遊泉石山林之樂，十分欣羨。</p>
<p>曾憶于鳳至女士前日歸國時，當對人語日：世間男子均糊塗，若無女子管束，便鬧亂子，可見于鳳至女土此次與張學良遊山玩水，涵養德性，此中自有道理，不是于鳳至女士管束丈夫的一種手段吧？</p>
<p>語日：家有賢妻，夫不遭橫禍。這種談話，在專制時代，却曾時髦過一時，此賢母良妻之所以膾炙於人口也。倘現在再將此語提出，恐世間男子，不免要提出抗議，認爲侮辱男性。因爲夫權高於一切，此女權運動之所以高唱入雲也。</p>
<p>但我細細老察社會中情形，夫權高於一切之說，本來廢話，若世間男子聞之，恐不免有受寵若驚之感。余見世間懼內的男子，都是循良之輩，惟有不懼內的男子，眞是無法收拾。反之，若不幸而娶着不賢之婦，則家庭自此多故矣。故有孝媳然後有孝子，此語眞不可誣也。</p>
<p>惟于女士說，世間男子均糊塗，此“均”字不免武斷得太厲害，一若世間的男子，均是糊塗得像張學良一樣。翻轉來說，世間男子均糊塗，雞道世間女子均不糊塗麼？此語不免有侮辱男性的嫌疑，難道世間善良的男子，都是他夫人管束之功麼？世間喜歡鬧亂子的男子；都是他的夫人不嚴加管束，或是男子的崛強不受管束的緣故麼？恐亦未必然也。</p>
<p>但我對於于女士的話，雖不能說絕對可信，而却亦有一部分可信，因爲現在的世界，懼內的丈夫太多，甘受內務部嚴加管束的，實在不少。卽看我的朋友之中，懷季常之懼者，至少限度，亦在半數以上。故現在高喊着女權運動者，往往说女子是男子的奴隸，是男子的玩物，似乎世间的女子，常在十八層地獄之下，噫！是何言歟？是何言歟？</p>
<p>故我說，夫權畢竟高於一切，則妻權必高於一切的一切，何也？世間的男子均糊塗也。</p>
<h3>“有計劃的飢餓”</h3>
<p>— 映純</p>
<p>據其理報駐柏林記者報告：按照官方公佈統計，德國一月份失業人數達一百八十五萬三千人，其中七十萬人現不能得到任何援助，必受飢餓與貧困。各方報告，表明一九三六年內糧食儲備額，激減二倍到三倍，最近閉幕的柏林農業展覽會，鮮明表現法西斯德國食物缺乏日甚的情形。該會在反對食額過多的口號下舉行，說明書稱：“我德人平均所食脂肪多過需要，脂肪消耗可減百分之廿五，關於肉類消耗也如此；反對食額過多的鬥爭，應可節省約一百萬馬克。一因爲有計劃的飢餓結果，去年內生育率激减，死亡率增加。同時徵入陸軍青年體格極不健全，據徵兵檢騐委員會報告：去年中應徵士兵中僅百分之七五可列入一等及二等：百分之一三·六體格衰弱；百分之九患消化器不良：百分之八，九患心臟病”。</p>
<p>德國近年來因爲擴充軍備的結果，國內已經一再鬧過糧食和牛油的恐慌，希特拉，戈林和沙赫特等，也一再聲言：寗可節省牛油面包來忍住飢餓，卻不可沒有大砲和軍艦，然而又將如何以滿足德國人民大衆的慾望呢？</p>
<p>我們姑且不論在“一百八十五萬三千人”中，是否有“七十萬人”因爲不能“得到任何援助”而至餓死，或者還有更多的人正在“延頸待斃”。但是“反對食額過多”和“有計劃的飢餓”的結果，卻巳明顯的造成了這種現象，就是“生育率激减，死亡率增加”。這，在希特拉之“獎勵生育”的計劃看來，不能不說是“大相逕庭”的！而尤其可以注意的，是“徵入陸軍”的“青年體格極不健全”，患心臟病，消化不良，體格衰弱者的總數居然佔百分之二十五，這不能不說是頗足驚人的數目：而且，假如長此以往，不用說還要不絕的增加的。……在陸軍中這末多“病夫”，將來卽使飛機，戰艦，大砲……等等是如何犀利，又怎末能够戰勝“第三帝國”所有的敵人，更何以完全統治全世界的迷夢呢？……確實的說來，這不能不說是一個可怕的危機呀！</p>
<p>正當希特拉先生正在打算染指蘇聯，干涉西班牙內政的時候，這末興高釆烈的時候，恐怕連他自己也沒有預想到這“危機”將招致怎樣的結果吧？那未，我們在這裏提一提，未知是替人“𣏌憂”否？其實在我們的近鄰，也不是沒有近似的國度啊！</p>
<h3>眼睛</h3>
<p>— 羅鬰</p>
<p>人類底鬥爭在一個龐大的機械間裏開展着。有一個時間，人們會覺得疲乏而祈祷一個心靈的窗子吧。</p>
<p>一九三×年七月以後，我正處於這麼一種可憐的境地。我對一種夢的固執還不曾破滅，在生活上，我所有的能力也許只消耗氏百分之幾的模樣，那不過是像一頭牛在疲憊過後底遲慢的反芻；可是在另一方面，又感到心靈底晦暗。</p>
<p>有一天下午，就在那小小的院子裏意外地遇到一對眼睛；牠們像微弱的火花閃了一下，在我底心上立刻劃開了那祈求着的窗子。透過那窗子，我發見了新的原野和新的天宇。</p>
<p>自然，想從那眼睛遠離是不容易的一。於是，我搬進了那個小院。那熱情的窗子不斷地爲我打開着，那麼遲留着有三五分鐘，合我盡量呼吸那新的原野，遊蕩在明朗的灌木園中。這樣，我底日子是着了色彩又顫起音律。</p>
<p>在幸福里，找開始注視那立在小女孩們中央的，穿黑色裙袍的女子。當我站到我底門裏，在坡璃格上停留一會，於是那明媚的眸子遲遲地舉起來，不給任何別的生命學察，幾乎是爲了我底專橫似地。</p>
<p>帶着戰慄，我挪開那眼睛，一個黑色的影子在心上站着。那個女子有曲垂着的頭髮，有時披在額邊，像戰不過疲弱似的；但那微瘦的肩頭每一轉側，却顯示了牠底充溢的活力；那微薄的嘴唇是現得蒼白，像一個職業婦女底蒼白，有時就給塗一些胭脂，却又露出了兩片可憐的紅色。這些都會使人棄絕，却唯有那對眼睛辯護着她。</p>
<p>在那些日子裏，我不斷地想；我們那最崇高的美德是不是就等於這眼睛裏所透出的光輝，極苦惱又極幸福的光輝？</p>
<p>在每面日記上，我銘記下了：那也許是唯一通往天堂和明天的門，是唯一保護美和英勇的劍鞘的那眼睛。</p>
<p>兩個月過去了。我還不曾和她說過一個字。有一天我搭了兩小時的火車去看我母親。我毫不隱瞞也不加誇惑地向她告述了那個女子，頗以爲她能同情我底思想的。可是她却說出了極使我傷心的話。</p>
<p>那個女子是一個同鄕，在家鄕底河彎那邊她生長過來的。她母親是跌入下流的深淵去而又污及善良的隣里的婦人；他父親是死灰般扛着筆管的庸夫；她底哥哥因爲沒了學費而慢慢地變成反當的孩子了；她底一個小弟弟給母親賣掉；而她自己由母親聘給一個鴉片商販。</p>
<p>“那女孩子會愁死的。人們說她一天天瘦下去啦，那可憐的好姑娘會活活悶死”！</p>
<p>我辯駁着那一切醜惡，我說我要使她活起來，希望母親最後能同情我。可是，她哭了，像在我兒時一樣地。她說：</p>
<p>“放充那思想吧！爲着你底名譽，爲着你父親所受過的誹誇，更爲着母親所受的他底暴戾。如果沒有那些不合理的思想，你們都是善良而受人稱讚的。那位校長知道你父親，也同樣誇耀過你。如果你記起這些，那就反一皮心吧”！</p>
<p>我聽了母親的話。我忍受着。</p>
<p>當我在一個下午重又趕南下的火車，我看到那無言的眼睛像兩隻手臂吊住了在我頸上。</p>
<p>如像千萬隻明媚的眼睛，去冒出火燄或自涸乾而死滅吧！我要遠離，我要離開這都市，這是我底戰術！</p>
<h3>更</h3>
<p>— 申冰</p>
<p>疲累像數不清的蟲豸從脚心駸駸地爬過，以棉花被裹着的身子蜷縮在床上，沒有一絲睡意。夜夢總是不値得提說的吧：成列的火車無因地跌下深邃的坑谷。而蓋世的勇士也因一些無謂的瑣事而深喟長歎起來。</p>
<p>披着睡衣站在爐前撥亮了奄息下去的火苗。在窗前，遂用手指塗去蒙在玻璃窗上的一層水氣，透過指痕的罅隙間而窺探窗外的夜。風逐着雪的點線打在窗上。</p>
<p>更聲是冷的。夜有一片廣闊的靜寂，偶然的呼號的風從遠處吹起，又在遠處消失。更聲投於夜的大海中，像一塊石子投於闇闇的水漬裏，密密地擴散着夜一樣可怖的音波。從遠處屋角裏傳來的梆子聲，在我的耳鼓上重新敘述一遍。</p>
<p>梆子的聲響漸漸地近了，傳徹在黑夜的空氣裏。守夜的人，更聲和一盞昏味的紅紙燈一同地掠過去，從黑濛濛的露到黑濛濛的露裏，幽靈一般地。透過指痕的罅𨻶裏，我望見一幢黑色而瘦瘠的身子，戴着破敝的黑氈帽，那一定是個衰弱的老年人。老人的枯槁的手提着一盞慵瀨的疲紅的燈，照不亮四周稠密的黑霧。路榜埋伏着碾人的石塊，樹根和水溝，在期待着他千次檢點中的一次不當心。</p>
<p>越過了廣關的靜寂，單調的梆子聲疎落地測量着無底的三更夜。風逐着雪的點線打在窗上。</p>

<h3>橫塘月色</h3>
<p>— 劉亡</p>
<p>我喜愛那座古樓的陳舊的石橋，雖然它比起距離七八丈的那座架在同一條河上的水門汀的橋來，是顯得太過的老邁，太過的寒傖。但是，正因爲這樣，適合了我古怪的性情，面愛好了牠。</p>
<p>每當黃昏，我們這一羣靠腦子和嘴巴和手吃飯的人們，剛一放下碗筷，便會不約而同的步向那石橋邊去。誰也不用倡議，也誰都不會否定，全像做一份固定的功課一樣，慢慢地走往同一個方向。今天如此，明天如此，天天郁如此，除非下雨的時光雨水把泥路佔得濕而濘滑，大家才不去橋邊，只得悶在屋子里。可是，這時候太息的聲音，便會接二運三的起來了。</p>
<p>我們往所的後面，是一道寬闊的公路，兩旁栽植着許事楓楊和白楊，牠們長壽又茂盛又高偉。那些雞心形的葉片，在微風中蕭蕭作響。我們聽着這蕭條耐肅穆的聲音，默默地走着。只有地上的煤屑，爲鞋子擦過時，發出一陣“沙沙”的微吟，應和着楓楊和白楊葉的低嘆。</p>
<p>大槪步行在公路上不到百步的光景，便被一條不算怎樣狹小的河流所阻。通着公路過去的，是漂亮的水門汀橋；而憤爲鄕間的人們走熟，也爲我們喜愛的，郤是在八七丈遠的那邊的小石橋。每天，我們只毫無留戀地跨過水門汀橋，不稍逗留，便兜了一們彎，步上石橋去。</p>
<p>這石橋眞是太老邁了，我們雖然無從考查牠建造的年代，可是，從那滿身風霜的態度上推測起來，總不能不承認那是百年以前的建築了。在石橋兩旁，圍着石的欄干，已變得搖動，我們用了一種過分的小心去坐在上面，而膽子較小的朋友，是寧願坐在石級上的。</p>
<p>橋洞作半圓形，那映在水面的弧線，曾使我凝視着消磨了好幾個月夜的，圓形的橋洞上面；有一條長方的黃石，刻着“橫塘橋”三個字，波有上欵，也沒有下欵。也許那不是先人們的疏忽，大槪是年月久長，爲風雨剝蝕得光了。在橋的一端，有一隻涼亭，在原先，是作爲旅人們的憇息之所的；而現在，里面堆滿了馬矢牛糞，和柴草的灰，人們再也走不進去了。那些自私人的行爲，在這上面也表現得十足。</p>
<p>有月亮的夜里，我們的興緻會更高。有的吹着口琴，有的唱着歌，有的吟着诗，眞是風雅之至，好像全都是中世紀的遺民，忘郤了紛爭的現實社會似的。但是，我得說，這種興緻，是不可厚非的，因爲我門這一羣男女，日裏整整地十個鐘頭，用我們的腦子，嘴巴，和手和別的，花費在給後一代人的教育上，不能說不辛苦了，如今這一點娛樂，不就很應該的嗎？</p>
<p>月亮的清輝照着這石橋，也照着我們一羣男女的身子。橋的影予映在水上，人的影子映在橋上。而橋畔那株年代久遠的柳樹，還把找的身影來掩拂我們。在河面，不時發山一聲聲“卜冬卜冬”的聲音，雖然低微，郤很清脆，那是小魚們看見月亮高興，浮在水面來嬉戲的情景。再遠處，則有一點兩點黯紅的漁火，緩緩地移動着飄忽着。襯着身後灰黑的天空，好似閃爍的星星一樣。</p>
<p>月亮躱在柳樹的長絲中，我們中校年長的一個，曾經在舊文學方面用過不少功夫的，他很興奮地，吟起詩來了：</p>
<p>“何處起鄕思，橫塘月七時……”</p>
<p>每個人爲他悠揚的聲調和悽然的情緒擊傷了，大家沉默着，直到遠處的漁火熄滅了的時候。</p>

<p>汽車專刋</p>
<h3>汽車重量减輕的檢討</h3>
<p>— 碩</p>
<p>車上各部份重量的分析　用怎樣方法可以去减輕</p>
<p>汽車的重量在製造和駕駛上都有很大關係、製造的時候。凡是金屬的互相接合。螺旋帽釘等類是不可少的東西。其他像車門•錶板•座具•等都免不掉用厚重鉅大的材料。在成本和人工機製方面。所費必大。至於駕駛上。車身的份量愈輕。那末引擎推動的力量所需也愈少。燃料和機油等的消耗自然也能經濟。至於徵稅相照也都能山於車身份量的低减隨之下落。關於汽車重量减輕的可能。最近美國赫特森汽車公司車身工程師葛里格氏。在汽車工程學會地脫洛埃支部舉行會議時。所讀的論文中。闡述甚詳。現在擇要的提出幾點。以供參考。</p>
<p>一輛汽車上最感沉重的東西。那無穎地便是單身了。不過別的方面。把各種零星的份量加起來。積少成多。影響於整個車子的份量也頗鉅大。譬如車窗車門風屏等所用的玻璃。合算起來。也有幾十磅之重。如果改用綜合的玻璃。那末份量就能代减。車身上有幾處金屬片部份。如能取銷。和幾許網鐵部份加以改進。再有車門座具等換用輕料物質之後。全車的重量就能大爲低减了。</p>
<p>目下我人習見的汽車。其全部重量大槪爲三千磅。其中多數的份量是在於底盤上。車身的重量普通爲九百磅。在底盤中。三百磅的重量屬於車架。車身中三百磅爲殻的結構重量。所有門的重量均不在內。這樣子一來。全身的結構部份就有六百磅的重量了。計算車身的重量。不屬於結構部份者。二百五十五磅屬於車門。一百七十五磅爲座具的份量。玻璃共重五十五磅。其他裝飾物及附屬物如地毯•罩•紙板•隔絕材料•及鐵器具等。共重一百七十磅。</p>
<p>現在車子上的車身金屬片。（這是包裹車身地位的金屬片）。其重量爲二百磅。卽使大部份爲鍜接法所連合。但是所有鐵栓•螺旋•鉸釘•等。算起來還有三十五磅之重。金屬片像機罩散熱器和護泥板等所用者。難然沒有結稱上承住的關係。不過用作遮蓋難看的機件部份。以求平滑美觀者。其重量共達一百八十一磅。</p>
<p>目下已在利用中的無車架式汽車。等到引用輕份金屬能够產生充份的强度。得有更進步的收獲時。造車時的重量問題。勢將到達鉅大的變化階段。關於完全應用輕金屬片一節。汽車界中還沒有像航空工具上研究般的精審。現在造車所用的材料。尤其是金屬片等。都要採用相當厚薄的村料。這是由於表層在支持上面吃重甚深的緣故。但有些地方已經在採用局部鍜接法。凡是和結構體有關連的地方。才採用較厚的材料。這樣子視减重方面當見良好的效果。</p>
<p>自從科學鍜接法发明以来。在重量的减輕方面成效最佳。因爲所有的村料在接連時無需重疊起來。所有釘栓螺旋等也得免除。因爲利用鍜接的方法。才有整片車頂和後壁板不致進重等的產生。化學家對於重量的减輕也有重大的貢獻。像介紹鋅•鋁•及一切綜合樹脂等施之實用等。在實際上製造如能减少一磅的重量。那末就能减輕一磅的製造成本哩。</p>
<p>一千九百年時的汽車。製造方面異常簡陋。祇不過在一輛四輪馬車上。放上一架馬達而已。在駛駕時候用鏈來驅動後輸。自一九一○年到一九二○年的時期中。製造的方法漸形更改。車上的每一部份都由專家計劃。每部份各不相同。這樣的風氣開後。在重量方面就不能避免的增加起來了。因此而竟有幾家公司。因爲不能解决這個問題。而不能賡續營業。祇有些不避艱難的幾家。才因積極改良而獲得大收成。從那時候起。汽車製造界中纔知道利用金屬片。和重量减輕等大問題。</p>
<p>一九三七年的汽申。在製造方而又回復至一九九○○年時的情形。就是全輛汽車是一整個。所有機身部，車軸，和其他部份。由裝配而成爲一整輛的汽車。同時式樣計劃者的勢力亦日見重大。每一個時期車子的式樣改變時。在結構上一定要符合於所改變的式樣。因爲式樣訐劃者的關係。所以結構上往往不能過份的改變哩。</p>
<h3>汽車中的廣告幕</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>在公共汽車中做廣告。這我們常見的事。不過那種廣告地位不能十分大。因之在引起讀者的注意方面。就不免遜色。而且有些汽車中地位很經濟。欲求安置廣告却也很困難。美國加州聖底谷地方的一個廣告商。名呌好克的。他別出心裁。利用電影的投射器。把廣告放映在車前首的幕上。並且都有色彩。以期促進乘客的注意</p>
<h3>汽車鱗爪</h3>
<p>— 云</p>
<p>紐約城汽車肇禍低减紐約是世界上著名大城之一。人口衆多。車輛交通向稱繁迫。故汽車肇禍事件之多。在美國具有五○○，○○○人口以上之大城中。亦當首屈一指矣。警務當局鑒於肇禍事件之日趨嚴重。踧焉憂之。因於一九三四年起。實行區間安全運動。俾此維護交通安全之責任。由警務各部分擔之。以收通力合作之效。兩年以來。成效卓著。全城之汽車肇禍事件。大見低减。良以居民及各社團均以安全運動爲已責。赤誠合作。乃得收獲此佳果也。據警務委員范侖丁氏之統計。以九個月之時朋計。一九三四年一月至九月止。紐約城中之車輛肇禍事件計爲二七，三二三起。致命者七百六十三人。受傷者三二，五六四人。一九三六年之同時間中。肇禍車件减至二○，一七六起。致命者五百八十七人。受傷者二三，八八三人。如以兩年之時期計算。則致命者减少一百七十六人。受傷者减八千六百八十一人。肇禍事件少七千一百四十七起。一九三六年與一九三五年之九個月時期中比較。（自一月一日起十月一日止）致命者减少一百二十五人。受傷者减少二千二百九十四人。所减之百分比率計致侖者百分之一七六。受傷者百分之八，七七。</p>
<p>去年美車出口數估計一九三六年美國所製造之汽車。其出口運往世界各地之數輛。至今尙未有確切統計發表。但據美國汽車製造商會出口委員主席葛雷亨氏之估計。其數目當介於五○○，○○○輛至七○○，○○○輛之間。一九三二年之美車出口數祇達一二○，○○○輛。一九三五年則爲五○八，○○○○輛。故一九三六年之汽車事業堪稱在增進日上中也。</p>
<p>漸成不重要之工具箱潑萊茅斯紐約服務部主任麥克主蒙氏最近稱。一九三七年新車在其進步上。可由一點覘之卽車上修理工具箱之將更不爲人所重視是也。麥氏略謂。不久之若干年前。工具箱被視爲汽車上最重要部份之一。使用汽車者每遇外出。必携帶全套修理工具。其數件實可供普通汽車間所用。至於新車亦多備工具。儘多儘佳。且車主更以自己習用者增益之。時至今日。情形已弗同。換置車胎之工具。祇有　　，鉗等項　　是　　　　。　　　　有　　　　數千里而從未　　啟工具箱者。且更有連工具箱在車中之何一部份。亦不之知者云。</p>
<p>寶塔克車廠僱工增多寶塔克車廠因出口增進。僱工日見衆多。云歲十一月中旬。其所僱員工高至九，五七三人。此爲連績打破僱工人數之第五星期。一九三五年之最高紀錄爲十二月之最末一星期。其僱工人數達六，九五九人。去春之紀錄爲七，六一二人。然至　　月中旬以後。始高達八，○○○人。去秋因新增一軸廠。僱工人數亦隨增六百人。而於籌廠重開之時。其所增員工殆達一，二○○人云。</p>
<p>路景不清極易於失事汽車肇禍之原因綦多。而汽車聘馳時因路景不明而失事者。亦爲主要原因之一。據美國哈萊氏稱。視綫短之道路。如前面爲轉灣式山崗。致將駕騁者前面之路景遮蔽時。最易肇禍。美國工程學會曾建議有一○○○尺口路景之道路。方適宣於安全之駕駛。因之哈萊氏亦主張凡兩程式四程來往之道路。駕駛者之而前至少須有消晰之路一○○○尺。至三程交通者則須有一五○○尺。方稱安全。</p>
<p>汽車用具之兩新發明美國汽車界現有新發明之汽車用具兩項。分誌如下。㊀撤沙器。汽車行駛於冰凝式雨水之地。往往因骨溜過甚。致失其平衡之勻勢。由是而釀成之肇禍事件。時有所聞紐約大學構械科副敎務長博浪氏近發明一種撤沙器。卽以車前端之排障具改造。頗見匠心。其法卽以排障具改裝成爲沙箱。上端開啟有門以爲成沙之用。以一機鈕通之於管理表板。用沙之時。卽以一動手之勞。而功效力見焉。㊁敞車之具可疊折車頂者。在春夏佳日。最爲出遊仕女所樂用。惟有一憾事。卽車頂之裝置爲頗費事耳。美國紐約一公司。近創製一能自動張置之車頂。祇須一二秒鐘之時間。卽能張置妥貼。其原理卽爲利用壓縮之空氣。儲空氣之箱櫃藏於車內。佔地並不甚大。其中所儲之氣壓力。可供張置及卸落車頂十五次之用。其動作之時。無論在停車時或行駛時。均無妨碍云。</p>
<h3>現代汽車的價値</h3>
<p>“凡購置美國現代化汽車者。對於所得之實在價値爲何。知者頗鮮凡人均以爲量重者力卽大。但福特先生則不然。彼於多年之前爲某鐵路總理時。卽開始提議用較輕之鐵道設備。當時明瞭者尙鮮。甚且有指責之者。今則吾人已可見火車之用較輕金屬製成者打破一切紀錄矣。汽車如達輕量之地位。其力量亦因下列二理由而加大。</p>
<p>㊀因設計之簡單。㊁因發展特種鋼料以充各部份之用。現在福特汽車中。所用特別發展鋼料約有三十六種之多。當然。重量較輕。價格亦較低。一九三五年汽車每百磅値美金四十一元。或每磅四角一分。現在甫經陳列之新福特汽車中。內有一種每磅約値美金二角。如此估算汽車價値固屬異乎尋常。但於此足見汽車與其他生活必需品之比較爲如何。美國牛排每磅値美金三角。電氣氷箱每磅約値四角。鋼琴每磅大約八角七分。上好無錢電大約每磅一元六角五分。一套西服每磅約合七元五角。凡此皆爲卓越之價値而汽車每磅之價値。則爲美金二角。此種消息殘値得知悉也。數年之前。如欲購得現値美金四百八十元之福特所有全部之特色。卽出一萬五千元恐亦難以辦到。此則姑以當時已有目下之各種改進點爲前提。實則當時此種種特色均付缺如焉。羣衆之中每有聰明人在焉。彼將日“哦我知道爲什麼價目能够减低面眞實價値反而提高了。恐怕你們一向是將勞役一天的减少吧！”實則如以汽車工業全部而論。同一汽車生產量。一九二九年需七十四人之工人者。今則需儿十八人。此則不過七年之前目。是以每一汽車所僱人工加多。其故何在。豈工人效率不如前耶。抑因經理不若前此之全神貫注耶。皆非也。實在原因乃在於此。新車所需之裝配與完成工作較多於前。因汽車本身無一處不較優於前。故時間與工作兩俱加多矣。故汽車工業除以商品供給我等外。更建立一偉大之主義卽物品愈高超愈優美。則愈爲大衆所易得。惟粗而不精之品。與夫錯誤百出者。價始昻貴</p>

He was loyal to the country and upright in his conduct. In recent years, he had assisted in military affairs and provided many services. It is proposed to request the National Government to issue an order praising him and holding a public funeral to commend him.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the matter of the public funeral for General Zhu Yizhi, Chairman Chiang issued the following statement: Central Executive Committee Member General Zhu Yizhi worked hard for the revolution and served the party-state. In recent years, as a Standing Committee Member of the Military Affairs Commission and Director of the Office, he was diligent and hardworking, upright and honest, understood the big picture, and did not seek vanity. He was especially admired by all soldiers in the country. In summary, his life's work was for the country, and he should be given a state funeral. However, every state funeral incurs huge public expenses. General Zhu was unambitious in life, determined to serve the country with loyalty, and would never want to waste national resources. Therefore, I also share this sentiment and requested a public funeral from the government. However, General Zhu's merits to the country are self-evident. The people who serve in the government in our country most need to be single-minded and work hard for national affairs, and not be distracted by personal honor and gain. General Zhu's past spirit of putting public interests before private interests is a model for all soldiers in the country. I deeply believe that young comrades must work together and strive forward.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Empty Words and Facts</h3>
<p>— Corner</p>
<p>At the beginning of General Hayashi's acceptance of the great mandate, he issued a policy outline, saying, "In order to realize the stability of East Asia and the common prosperity of all nations, we will carry out a national consensus on diplomatic work, aiming to clarify international relations." Later, in a speech in the Diet, he further clarified this purpose, saying that China and Japan should "join hands to achieve the stability of East Asia..." Even Sugiyama Gen, the Minister of the Army who holds a sword in one hand and a continental policy plan in the other, echoed the sentiment, saying, "The army has no plans to invade China." On the people's side, the Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun published an editorial at the time of the cabinet change, urging the future government to pay attention to friendly diplomacy. "Establishing friendly relations with other countries is the universal demand of the Japanese people. Any policy of the government in the field of diplomacy must take the promotion of friendship as its ultimate goal. A cabinet, regardless of its composition, should not change this basic principle policy." Japanese political commentator Takashina Murobuse also said, "Japan should help build a unified Chinese state. Japan's assistance to China and China's acceptance of it must follow the path of a king." Recently, Yoshida Seiji, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, warned his countrymen, saying, "Japan must eliminate its harsh policy toward China and adopt a practical policy that can be accepted by the Chinese government in terms of morality." All of this is sufficient to show that the Japanese government and public have changed their old faces and have a new understanding and a new understanding of China. At the same time, they are also working hard to correct their past mistakes in order to achieve close cooperation between the two countries. But is that really the case?</p>
<p>If we look at it from a longer perspective, if we understand that the adjustment of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations is a slogan that has existed since the September 18th Incident, and if we combine the various realities of the troops stationed in China recently for an overall observation, we can know that the slogan of friendship is one thing, and the invasion of China is another. Although the Japanese diplomatic authorities advocate the unification of diplomacy, and Army Minister Sugiyama Gen also promised to agree with the diplomatic policy, the Japanese army will pay close attention. However, with regard to North China, they still insist that the army must directly negotiate, citing the existence of existing military agreements. The meaning of so-called direct negotiation is very clear. In the future, the northern strategy toward China will of course still only advance and not retreat. The policy of the Japanese garrison in North China aims to complete the "specialization" of North China as its sole goal. If this goal is not achieved in one day, their conspiracy will not be abandoned in one day. Recently, a certain foreigner, under the pseudonym "Da Gongyuan," instructed the traitor Xiao Deping and others to organize a pseudo-communist party organization to disrupt the public order in Tianjin. The intention is nothing more than to create an excuse to put pressure on the Hebei-Chahar Permanent Bureau to achieve the goal of specialization.</p>
<p>Let's talk about economic cooperation between the two countries. According to a recent report by the Allied News Agency, the Japanese Four Ministers' Conference decided on its policy toward China: "Strive to avoid policies that give the Chinese people a sense of oppression, and attempt to clarify the air between the two countries through economic and cultural cooperation between the people of the two countries." Economic cooperation must be carried out on an equal footing and based on the principle of mutual benefit in order to be true friendship. However, the other party will never recognize this principle. The Japanese Shanghai Daily News published an editorial not long ago, bluntly expressing its opposition to this view. The newspaper believes that "those who advocate Sino-Japanese cooperation should understand that the two countries do not stand on an equal footing... Japan's development in politics, economy and other sectors far exceeds that of China. Therefore, it is extremely unwise to advocate equality in future negotiations between the two countries..." This view can represent the views of many people who wear commanding swords and are controlled by commanding swords. If this view is not abandoned, I am afraid that even if goodwill is broadcast every day and economic and cultural envoys are sent every day, the result may still be equal to zero.</p>
<h3>Five Major U.S. Steel Mills Accept Workers' Demands</h3>
<p>Implement 40-Hour Work Week and Announce Wage Increase</p>
<p>⊙American Bethlehem Today, five national steel mills have announced wage increases, employing a total of 128,500 workers. If other steel mills follow suit in increasing wages, the number of workers who will benefit will reach 500,000. (1st Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙American Bethlehem The Bethlehem Steel Company announced today an increase in wages of 10% per hour, setting the regular work week at 40 hours, effective March 16. The company employs a total of 65,000 workers, and the wage increase will amount to 20 million yuan per year. (1st Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Pittsburgh The five largest independent steel mills in the United States, due to the fact that Lewis, the chairman of the Industrial Organization Committee, is currently making every effort to encourage workers in various factories to form a large union, have accepted the demands of thousands of employees to increase wages and reduce working hours today in order to avoid disputes. Currently, the work week is 48 hours, which will now be changed to 40 hours. The daily wage will be at least five U.S. dollars. As a result of increasing the wages of 550,000 people, the annual wage payment will increase to 100 million yuan. The company's decision is in line with the law advocated by Hull-Shirley that all factories accepting government orders should limit the weekly working hours to 40 hours, and can break the deadlock between the Navy Department and various steel mills. Navy shipyards will no longer be short of steel materials. Bethlehem Company, the second largest steel mill in the United States, is also one of the five factories that made concessions today. At the same time, Carnegie Illinois Company, the largest steel mill in the United States, has begun collective bargaining. The principle implemented by American steel mills for 50 years has been broken. Labor leaders are now overjoyed and regard it as the greatest victory for labor in 40 years. (2nd Day Reuters Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) The deadlock between the steel industry and the government has suddenly broken today. Secretary of Labor Perkins hopes that the 40-hour work week system can be established and the steel companies' resistance to Navy Department contracts can be resolved. Phipps, manager of Carnegie Illinois Steel Company, met today with representatives of the Steel Industry Workers Organizing Committee and agreed to hold a meeting tomorrow to discuss the recommendations of the Wage and Hour Adjustment Committee, which proves that the American steel industry has clearly abandoned the 50-hour work week and the policy of not negotiating with outside unions. (1st Day National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Workers at various steel mills in the United States have made several demands to the factory:</p>
<p>㊀ Increase wages;</p>
<p>㊁ The union can represent workers and sign work agreements with the factory;</p>
<p>㊂ Implement a 40-hour work week;</p>
<p>The authorities of each factory immediately refused to conduct direct negotiations with the workers' representatives in accordance with traditional policies. The workers then proposed to declare a strike on April 1. It is now learned that regarding the increase in wages, the four largest steel mills have agreed to comply after repeated requests from the Steelworkers Union. The proposal to declare a strike on April 1 may be canceled as a result. Regarding the union's ability to represent workers in negotiations, and regarding the implementation of a 40-hour work week, in addition to National Steel Corporation, which has already accepted it, Republic Steel Corporation and Youngstown Steel Corporation have also followed suit. Regarding this dispute, personnel from the Federal Department of Labor believe that a resolution is promising. Therefore, the steel materials required by various factories, which were previously interrupted due to the fact that various steel mills did not implement the "Hull-Shirley Law," are expected to be delivered as usual in accordance with the original contract in the future. According to the Hull-Shirley Law, all factories that accept government orders must implement a 40-hour work week. Most steel mills refused government orders in order to resist this law, so various shipyards are worried about a shortage of steel materials. (1st Day Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) The strike situation in various parts of the United States has now eased. The Douglas Aircraft Factory in Santa Monica and the Northrup Factory in Walkergen have both resumed work.

At the same time, the general manager of Carnegie Illinois Steel Corporation has also expressed his willingness to recognize the Industrial Organization Committee as a representative organization for negotiations.

<h3>U.S. President Signs Two Laws</h3>
<p>Judges Retire When They Are Old, and Will Control Sugar Production</p>
<p>(Washington) Congress recently passed two bills, one stipulating that Supreme Court judges who are 70 years old should retire, but they can still receive full pay, and the second authorizing the President to enter into reciprocal trade agreements with various countries before 1940, without the need for Senate approval. This bill was recently signed by President Roosevelt and has become law. (1st Day Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a special message to Congress today, suggesting that the current sugar production restriction measures be continued, and advocating that a domestic production tax of at least 7.5 cents per pound be levied. Based on this calculation, the government can receive 100 million yuan annually. The President believes that Congress should enact laws to protect small-scale sugar merchants, both new and old, and provide subsidies so that they can share the benefits equally. As for the amount of the quota, the President did not specify it, but said that in order to ensure the expansion of the US sugar input market, the import quota of other countries should not be reduced.

<h3>U.S. Senate Discusses New Neutrality Law</h3>
<p>Based on the Pittman Case, Borah Critiques Fiercely</p>
<p>(Washington) The Senate recently discussed the new Neutrality Act proposed by Pittman, chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Borah often gave speeches expressing his approval in general, but fiercely criticized a certain clause in the bill, namely, prohibiting American merchant ships from carrying certain goods to belligerent countries. He said that if this layer is clearly written, "the United States will become an ally of a powerful naval country in an intangible way." One of the belligerent countries will inevitably send warships to intercept the other side's merchant ships loading goods in American ports, or even bomb the place of origin of these goods with aircraft. It is not impossible for the United States to resist or listen to what it does, and indirectly support it. For example, if the Soviet Union and Japan declare war one day, the United States may allow Japan to do whatever it wants because the Japanese navy is stronger, and become an ally of Japan in an intangible way, which is actually contrary to neutrality. Finally, Borah also advocated that the United States should have a strong navy to protect foreign trade. (1st Day Havas Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Japan-Burma Trade Agreement Established</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on the 1st that Japan and Burma have signed a trade agreement. The content is as follows: The Japanese representative, Consul-General Shuzawa, and the Burmese representative, Finance Officer Glabley, have been negotiating on trade issues between Japan and Burma since December last year. Recently, the two countries agreed to establish and signed an agreement in New Delhi at 7:30 p.m. on March 1. The Japan-Burma negotiations are related to the Japan-India negotiations. That is, the India-Burma trade agreement conditionally stipulates that when India applies a quota system to Japanese cotton products, Burma should also impose this system on Japanese woven products. Therefore, there are these negotiations between Japan and Burma. Because the Japan-India negotiations are still in progress, the detailed content of the Japan-Burma agreement established this time is not convenient to disclose, but the general content is as follows: That is, Burma allows the maximum quota system that the Indo-Burmese agreement can allow for Japanese cotton products, on the condition that Japan purchases a certain amount of Burmese cotton. The remaining points of this agreement are about the import of Japanese cotton cloth and the export of Burmese cotton. After the consultation with India is over, the full content of this agreement can be announced. (2nd Day Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Navy Minister Announces Policy</h3>
<p>Willing to Participate in Disarmament, But Not Willing to Initiate</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At the Budget Fourth Subcommittee meeting today, Navy Minister Yonai answered questions from Tanada, discussing the Navy's insistence on the third supplementary principle, the interrelationship between air power and warships, and at the same time, elucidating the atmosphere of the disarmament agreement and the position of the Japanese Navy. The gist of his argument is recorded on the left: Recently, there have been many advocates of the omnipotence of aviation, and the utility of surface warships has gradually decreased. However, the Navy, based on the current situation and the future, believes that aviation power should be supplemented as a kind of auxiliary force for the fleet according to the current situation, and should strive to enrich it. The General Disarmament Conference of the League of Nations can be held on May 5th and 6th this year. The atmosphere of disarmament of the two countries has now begun. As for the Navy's intention for disarmament, if a third country is invited to conduct disarmament, then our side should gladly respond to the fair and proper disarmament. However, if there is no hope of establishing a disarmament agreement, then Japan will not take the initiative to hold disarmament. (2nd Day Allied Telegram)</p>

Regarding the international situation, after listening to a report by Foreign Minister Ciano, the Supreme Council immediately passed a resolution stating, "Declare solidarity with the Nationalist forces in Spain. After General Franco's victory, the disturbances of Bolshevism can be eradicated from a corner of Western Europe." The resolution then enthusiastically praised the achievements of Foreign Minister Ciano and expressed satisfaction with the Mediterranean agreement established between Britain and Italy, stating, "The relations between the two sides have been clarified, which is very beneficial." The substantial results achieved during the talks between the Italian and Turkish diplomatic authorities in Milan should be recorded. Finally, a congratulatory message was sent to General Graziani, Governor of Abyssinia, hoping for his speedy recovery from his injuries. The Supreme Council is scheduled to continue its meeting at ten o'clock tomorrow evening. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is expected that the resolution to increase the national army will focus on the navy and air force. The navy and air force were both strengthened last autumn. Air force bases have begun to be built in Sardinia in Africa, Sicily in the Mediterranean, and southern Italy. It is also reported that a naval base will be established on the volcanic island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean for light warships to dock. After these bases are completed, Italy will be able to completely control traffic between Sicily and Africa. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Paris newspapers have recently commented on the ongoing meeting of the Italian Fascist Supreme Council, speculating on the direction of Italian policy. Pertinax, a famous reporter for the *Echo de Paris*, declared, "Even with the most optimistic attitude, Italy is at least collecting pretexts against Britain, France, and the United States. However, the excesses of Italian policy can be mitigated by changes in the situation." *Le Jour* stated, "The axis formed by Germany and Italy cannot change certain geographical realities. We have no intention of forcing Italy to hold the Brenner Pass in the north, but if the Italian troops stationed at the Thealps Pass are slightly careless, the consequences will be unimaginable." Madame Tabouis, a famous reporter for *L'œuvre*, is concerned that Italy's current policy "is detrimental to the French territories in North Africa," because the transportation lines connecting these territories to mainland France are already in the hands of Italy and Germany.

<h3>Changes in the Italian Cabinet</h3>
<p>The Colonial Minister Will Resign</p>
<p>(Rome) General Bono, the former commander-in-chief of the Italian East African Expeditionary Force, was criticized by recent newspaper articles for his ineffective campaign in East Africa, leading to his replacement. He accused Colonial Minister Lessona of ignoring the newspaper criticism. Disagreements arose between the two. General Bono demanded a duel with Lessona, but Prime Minister Mussolini disapproved and decided to organize a court of honor to determine the truth. The court has now declared that even if there are disagreements between General Bono and Lessona, there is no need for a duel. This incident can be considered over. Recently, there have been rumors that there will be changes in the cabinet, and Colonial Minister Lessona may resign and take up an important position in an Italian colony in East Africa. This rumor is related to the disagreement between Bono and Lessona. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<h3>Czechoslovakia Willing to Cooperate with Austria-Hungary</h3>
<p>Stabilizing the Economy of Central Europe; Speech by the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister</p>
<p>⊙ Prague, Capital of Czechoslovakia: Foreign Minister Krofta gave a speech to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives this morning, stating: ㊀ He is satisfied that the United States has a clearer understanding of its solidarity with democratic countries. ㊁ The countries of the Little Entente are united. ㊂ Czechoslovak foreign policy is still based on the alliance treaty established between France and Czechoslovakia in 1924. ㊃ Britain is concerned about the situation in Central Europe and recognizes the importance of Czechoslovakia. ㊄ The mutual assistance agreement between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, established in 1935, is purely defensive. Rumors of Czechoslovakia's communization are not true. ㊅ The mutual relations between Czechoslovakia and Poland are as before. ㊅ Although German newspapers have fiercely criticized Czechoslovakia, the relations between Germany and Czechoslovakia are generally satisfactory. ㊇ Czechoslovakia is very willing to cooperate with Austria-Hungary to stabilize the economies of Central European countries.

<h3>Britain Unconcerned by Italy's Military Preparations</h3>
<p>Believes its Financial Strength is Enough to Prevail; However, Italians Say the Nature is Serious</p>
<p>(Rome) Observers have commented on the military preparation measures passed by the Fascist Supreme Council yesterday, especially the measure that scientific and technical personnel should work together to implement a policy of economic self-sufficiency, believing that the nature of these measures is more serious than any previously taken by Italy. This is the result of anti-armament propaganda in democratic countries' newspapers. For example, the position of head of the Ordnance Department, which was originally established after the Italian-Abyssinian dispute two years ago, has now been extended for five years, indicating that Italy still believes that armed conflict is possible. In addition, the fact that all men between the ages of eighteen and fifty-five should be trained on a regular basis was not even adopted during the Italian-Abyssinian War, further demonstrating the seriousness of the situation. The Supreme Council has confirmed that Italy's current foreign policy is based on an understanding between Italy and Germany, but Italy is still willing to live in peace with other countries and will establish solidarity with the Nationalist government in Spain. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) After German Ambassador Ribbentrop delivered a speech in Leipzig, and the Italian Fascist Supreme Council made decisions regarding military preparations, British political figures expect Foreign Secretary Eden to deliver an important speech in the House of Commons this afternoon to comment on the matter. Regarding the various decisions made by the Fascist Supreme Council, some say that their nature is extremely serious, but political figures do not believe so, saying that during the previous Italian-Abyssinian War, when relations between Britain and Italy were tense, Italy often took measures of the same nature, so there is no need to overemphasize them. Britain's rearmament plan will not be affected in any way by Italy's military preparation measures, because in terms of economic and financial strength, Britain is undoubtedly far superior to Italy.

<h3>New Italian Ambassador to Spain Presents Credentials to Rebel Leader</h3>
<p>⊙ Salamanca: The new Italian Ambassador, Gatta Lubo, paid a visit to General Franco, the leader of the Nationalist government, yesterday to present his credentials. He delivered a speech, stating, "Nationalist Spain is currently fulfilling the glorious task of allowing the country to enjoy peace and occupy its rightful place in the world." Italy is in sympathy with this. General Franco replied that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Fascism have achieved much and are deeply admired. After the ceremony, Franco and Gatta Lubo appeared together on the balcony, and the band immediately played the Italian national anthem and the Spanish "Royal March" (the national anthem of the monarchy, now adopted by the Nationalist forces). The audience cheered enthusiastically. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<h3>German Ambassador to Britain Delivers Speech Demanding the Restoration of Colonies</h3>
<p>Four-Year Economic Plan Benefits Peace; German Rearmament is Purely Defensive</p>
<p>(Berlin) German Ambassador to Britain, Ribbentrop, returned from London and attended the opening ceremony of the Leipzig City Market yesterday, where he delivered a speech addressing the issues of restoring old colonies, the four-year economic plan, rearmament, and anti-communism. He stated, "The world's weaker countries still have the right to acquire colonies, let alone Germany. We will firmly reject any argument that opposes this right. Even the Treaty of Versailles, when the drafters decided to place German colonies under the mandate of various countries, clearly intended to leave this issue for future resolution and did not consider it a final decision. The four-year economic plan can allow Germany to be satisfied in terms of raw materials and is beneficial to peace. "Germany is different from countries that enjoy preferential treatment and cannot develop abroad. It must have a way to remedy this. Moreover, if world trade is to allow Germany to participate in a normal manner, the prerequisite is the implementation of this plan." Ribbentrop then addressed the issue of armaments, stating that he did not believe in the notion of unlimited armaments. "The extent to which each country expands its armaments should be limited by the size of its territory, its financial surplus or deficit, its geographical location, and its sense of security. Germany's rearmament is purely defensive." Finally, he fiercely criticized Bolshevism and stated that the Anti-Comintern Pact established between Germany and Japan on November 26 of last year is an important step for order-loving countries to unite to combat chaos. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙ Leipzig: At the opening of the Leipzig City Market, German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop delivered a speech to the National Socialist Party's Economic Policy Committee, with the German four-year plan and German colonial demands as the theme. He said that the four-year plan proves that German economic leaders have strived to make it possible for Germany's trade in goods with various countries to return to normal. However, Hitler's announcement of the four-year plan was also a last resort, because repeated attempts to sign international commercial agreements had failed. But Germany is not seeking complete self-sufficiency. President Roosevelt's economic policy and the resolutions of the Ottawa Conference both aim at economic self-sufficiency. The German four-year plan reduces Germany's funds for purchasing foreign raw materials, thereby increasing funds for other international trade, which is actually a plan to promote international trade in goods. Regarding the colonial issue, Ribbentrop pointed out that the Treaty of Versailles divided countries into "haves" and "have-nots," creating a sense of unease. Therefore, Germany's old colonies should be returned to eliminate this unease. Germany does not want to adopt an imperialist colonial policy or use colonies to build military bases, and reiterated Hitler's guarantee that Germany does not want to demand the expansion of its navy after the restoration of its colonies.

<h3>Britain's Attitude Towards Germany Has Not Changed</h3>
<p>If There is a Concession, Germany Should Make It</p>
<p>(London) After German Ambassador Ribbentrop elaborated on the issue of old colonies in his speech at the Leipzig City Market yesterday, observers here commented that Ribbentrop's actions constitute a polemic and are contrary to diplomatic etiquette. Britain's position on this issue has not changed as a result. For the sake of easing tensions in Europe, if there is a need for concessions, it must come from Germany. The key is not in Britain.

<h3>Monitoring Plan for the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>Encountering Twists and Turns</p>
<p>(London) The monitoring plan for the non-intervention policy in the Spanish Civil War, originally scheduled to begin on the 6th of this month, suddenly encountered twists and turns during a meeting of the subcommittee of the Adjustment Committee this afternoon. It seems that the monitoring plan will not be implemented as scheduled. During the usual meetings, there are differences of opinion between the countries concerned, totaling two points:</p>
<p>㊀ Chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Lord Plymouth, proposed that if the Nationalist Southern Army of Spain continues to advance northward, then the sea area in southern Spain, which is currently scheduled to be monitored by the navies of Italy and Germany, should be monitored by Britain and France. Representatives from Italy and Germany immediately expressed reservations, saying that according to this proposal, if the Nationalist Southern Army of Spain continues to win victories, then Italy and Germany should be completely excluded and unable to participate in the monitoring plan. In that case, the Nationalist forces in Spain would be blockaded by the navies of Britain and France. Representatives from Italy and Germany could not assume this responsibility and would ask their respective governments for instructions.</p>
<p>㊀ Chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Lord Plymouth, then formally proposed on behalf of the British government that all foreign volunteers currently fighting in Spain should be recalled. Representatives from France, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Sweden, and Belgium all supported this proposal. The Portuguese representative said that the country had already prepared a law to recall Portuguese citizens who were engaged in incitement abroad. Lord Plymouth said that his proposal refers not only to those engaged in political incitement, but to any person who is currently participating in the civil war in Spain. At this point, representatives from Italy and Germany again expressed reservations, saying that the "neutralization" of Spanish bank gold deposited abroad must be resolved first. As a result, the two sides had widely divergent opinions, and the subcommittee is scheduled to meet again on the 5th of this month to discuss the matter. (Central News Agency, 1st, Havas)</p>
<h3>Romanian Student Atrocities</h3>
<p>School Principal Stabbed and Seriously Injured; Government Takes Stern Measures</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest, Capital of Romania: The Principal of the University of Iasi, Mr. Bratulu, was stabbed multiple times in the head and body and had one ear cut off by three students yesterday. He was seriously injured, and as of the time of the dispatch, his condition was still very serious. After the incident, the police arrested 56 students at the university and searched the student union affiliated with the fascist "Iron Guard." It is reported that Bratulu was originally affiliated with the National Peasants' Party. After this incident, the party may appeal to the "Peasant Defense League" to protect the safety of its members. This group was originally responsible for protecting party members. (Central News Agency, 2nd, Havas)</p>
<p>⊙ Bucharest, Capital of Romania: After the Principal of the University of Iasi, Mr. Bratulu, was suddenly stabbed by three students the day before yesterday, the cabinet held a state council meeting this morning to decide on various important measures to maintain order and avoid similar incidents from happening again, including: ㊀ All universities and student unions nationwide will be temporarily closed. ㊁ Students are prohibited from joining political parties or participating in political demonstrations. Those who violate this will be expelled from school. ㊂ The law prohibiting the wearing of political party uniforms should be strictly enforced. ㊃ All secret societies should be immediately dissolved. ㊄ Negotiations should be conducted with the Greek Orthodox Church elders to prohibit clergymen from participating in politically hostile movements.

<h3>Japanese Hayashi Cabinet Seeks Full-Time Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Obata Firmly Declines; Sato's Voice is Very High</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When Japanese Prime Minister Hayashi Senjuro first started forming a cabinet, he invited former Ambassador to Germany Obata Nishikichi to be the Foreign Minister, but Obata doubted whether the Hayashi cabinet could thoroughly realize the unification of diplomacy and adopt his diplomatic policy, so he did not accept. Later, Hayashi asked Hirota to invite Obata to join the cabinet, but Obata still declined Hayashi's invitation on the grounds of physical weakness. Finally, Hayashi asked Kodama Hideo to urge him, but Obata finally refused. According to reports this morning, Hayashi does not believe that the invitation of Obata to join the cabinet is hopeless, and still believes that Obata will eventually come forward to take on the difficult task after being urged again. However, when Obata spoke to the press this morning, he expressed surprise at the rumor that his refusal of Hayashi's invitation was merely a "trick," and said that the Foreign Minister issue had absolutely nothing to do with him. This seems to be an expression of Obata's strong determination. In the current environment, Sato Naotake is the most powerful candidate for Foreign Minister. Sato is expected to return to Tokyo tonight, but it is reported that Sato is not only opposed by a certain party, but also has problems within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, it is necessary for the Hayashi cabinet to select a full-time Foreign Minister, so the Foreign Minister issue is unlikely to be delayed for too long. (Central News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<p>⊙ Kobe: Ambassador to France Sato Naotake, accompanied by his wife and daughter, arrived in Kobe at 4:00 PM on the 1st aboard the Yasukuni Maru. Many officials and civilians went to the pier to welcome them to the Toyo Hotel. Regarding the issue of becoming Foreign Minister, he always avoided giving a clear answer and released a statement saying that since this general arrived in Singapore, he had been asked about the issue of becoming Foreign Minister everywhere, and there were even those who predicted that he must have accepted this negotiation and expressed their hopes, which is very regrettable. What can be asserted now is that before he departed from Paris, he only received the news of the establishment of the Hayashi cabinet and had absolutely no news about the negotiation of becoming Foreign Minister. Even if there is this negotiation in the future, he can only answer that it cannot be decided by him alone. The issue of taking office is not a trivial matter. In this difficult situation, it is unclear whether his views will be accepted by the cabinet and whether there is room for his opinions to be adopted in Japan at present. Therefore, even if he receives a negotiation, everything will have to wait until he arrives in Tokyo before he considers it. (2nd, Allied Telegram)</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebel Forces Bomb Capital Fiercely</h3>
<p>Government Forces Hold the Advantage</p>
<p>⊙ Madrid: The rebel forces shelled the capital fiercely at midnight, firing ten to twelve shells per minute. Many civilian houses were hit and caught fire, and the sound of fire trucks was deafening. There were also four loud explosions heard on the front line, which were obviously landmines. The command of the Usoala district reported that the government forces were still able to defend their positions. The university district also reported by telephone that the rebel forces were ready and about to attack. (2nd, National Telegram)</p>

<h3>Swatow Traitors Slightly Restrained</h3>
<p>Important Traitor Lin Mao-gu Has Also Been Arrested; Several Other Traitors Have Been Executed</p>
<p>Swatow Correspondence: Since the standing bureau has strictly banned gambling, the general gamblers here have all disappeared. However, residents of foreign-owned firms and hotels rely on special forces to openly operate gambling dens. These people usually have close relations with ronin, or serve as special agents sent by a certain party to the inland. They come to Swatow to gather in foreign-owned firms and hotels, indulge in opium and gambling, and stay up all night, disturbing the neighbors. Police Chief Xue Hanguang believed that gambling violated the ban and that traitors dared to openly destroy the ban, relying on foreign power as a talisman. Therefore, he sent detectives to investigate and arrested more than 100 notorious local traitors and gamblers in and around the gambling dens, including the famous smuggler Lin Mao-gu. They were detained at the police station for interrogation, and those with serious circumstances were sent to the Stone Fort Disciplinary Camp for detention, or separately escorted to the 155th Division Headquarters for investigation. When the famous criminals were escorted, they were chained with large iron chains around their necks and their hands and feet were locked with iron fetters, showing a very serious situation. The faces of the criminals were ashen. Among them were Li Weimin, a failed journalist related to smuggling, Li Ruiping, a doctor who often frequented a foreign-owned firm on Shengping Road, and Xiao Guangping, the former secretary of a certain bureau, all of whom were arrested. In addition, there were also some ordinary people whose names were not very well-known. Among the traitors and gamblers arrested, Lin Mao-gu's circumstances were the most serious. Lin had colluded with ronin in smuggling for many years and had a large winery in Tian'gang Township, Chenghai, where he imported alcohol from a certain place and faked local wine. When he was intercepted by the customs last year, Lin fled into a foreign-owned firm, falsely claiming to be a citizen of a certain country. He had profited hundreds of thousands of yuan from smuggling over the years. Lin had cultivated no less than 500 to 600 traitors, who ran rampant on the coasts of Nan'ao, Chenghai, and Raoping, dominating the Fujian-Guangdong border. In addition, several traitors who were arrested, with conclusive evidence of their crimes, were escorted to the administrative office for investigation and handling. It is reported that they have been executed, to the great satisfaction of the people. After this action, those who were usually arrogant and high-spirited have disappeared like birds and beasts, and dare not go to a certain country's agencies or secretly associate with people from a certain country. In addition, the foreign-owned hotels and firms that were previously crowded with people and intoxicated with extravagant pleasures because of gambling are now ghostly and silent, evoking a sense of the vicissitudes of life. When passing by the gate of a foreign-owned firm, everyone's eyes emit a kind of monitoring spirit. A certain consul has repeatedly made unreasonable protests and demands to the authorities, but we have not only refuted them with reason, but also reorganized the people's patriotic array. If a certain party has private goods shipped out or a person secretly approaches a certain party, we know everything clearly. Therefore, the actions of a certain party in Chaoshan are no longer as free as before.</p>
<h3>Japanese Discover World's Top-Ranked Mine in Northern Manchuria</h3>
<p>Exceeds Alsace-Lorraine Mine Contested by Germany and France; Development Could Aid Japanese Puppet Industrial and Defense Efforts</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: A Japanese mineral surveyor has issued a startling announcement: An unparalleled high-quality ore deposit, truly the world's best, has been discovered in Dagudong, within the puppet province of Sanjiang in northern Manchuria. This deposit surpasses even the Alsace-Lorraine mines, for which Germany and France shed blood and engaged in bitter conflict. Reportedly, the mine is located very near Harbin, approximately twenty kilometers from Sanxing. The mining area is vast, stretching from Dagudong through the southern banks of the Songhua River to the Mudanjiang River basin, forming a broad, extensive, and exceptionally rich mineral deposit. Current investigations, limited to the exposed coal seams, indicate that coal production will be a byproduct, yielding 1 to 1.5 million tons annually. The primary product will be lubricating oil, with an annual output of 3 million tons. The Japanese discoverer, in collaboration with experts from the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), is actively continuing the investigation. Results have confirmed it as the world's largest mine. The Japanese puppet authorities recognize its significant implications for their five-year industrial development plan. Mantetsu and others will initially invest 20,000 yuan to establish a new company. Once the weather warms and the ground thaws, an additional 500,000 yuan will be invested for trial excavations. If development proves successful, the Japanese believe that both Japan and the Northeast will be able to acquire high-quality lubricating oil and coal at extremely low prices. This move is expected to have a tremendous impact on industry and national defense in both Japan and the Northeast.</p>

<p>Man and Woman Attempt Double Suicide in Inn</p>
<p>Nanjing Town, a market town in the South Sandbar area of Changshu County borders Nantong. Though not many merchants reside there, it has developed some form. Yangjia Inn, located in the town, recently had two travelers, a man and woman, check in. Each was about 20 years of age. According to the male's registration, his name was Tang Ninglin, from Shierweigang, and the woman was his relative. It appeared the couple was very loving and affectionate, which led some to believe them as an informal couple. However, the inn was only interested in earning money. However, on the afternoon of the next day, the couple were still in bed, and the waiter found them unconscious with the woman lying in the man's arms. After medical attention, the man regained consciousness, while the woman passed. The man was then identified as Ma Cailin, a local bully from Shierweigang with no formal job. The woman was from northern Jiangsu and was his mistress. The woman's real husband, who is a police officer in Nantong, had found out about his wife's affair and was going to do something about it. As a result, the man and woman brought two yuan worth of raw opium with intentions of committing suicide together. The man was saved but is mentally unstable. The owner of the inn has reported this to the police, who have requested a court order to investigate.</p>

During the recent New Year holiday, he hired a Changzhou local opera troupe of seven men and women to perform at the teahouse, selling tickets for seven copper coins each. On the afternoon of the 28th, Jiang Futian attempted to enter without purchasing a ticket, leading to a verbal altercation with Liu Quandde. Jiang Futian was subsequently beaten by Xu Yongkang and others. Injured, Jiang Futian returned to his village and gathered over a hundred villagers. Liu Quandde, hearing of this, also gathered two hundred villagers. Both sides armed themselves with knives, clubs, carrying poles, and other weapons, resulting in a prolonged brawl with twenty to thirty injuries on each side.</p>

Upon confirmation, on the afternoon of the 27th of last month, the county government, in conjunction with the Guanhaiwei Public Security Bureau, led police to search the premises, seizing a large quantity of red pills, opium, and over a dozen sets of lamps and pipes. The main suspect, Luo Jun'an, was also apprehended and handed over to the Sixth District Security Command for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Travel Correspondence</p>
<h3>Chengdu and Sichuan Politics</h3>
<p>— Geng Ya</p>
<p>Since this province abolished the defense zone system, the political situation in Chengdu has gradually stabilized, the population has increased, transportation has developed, and industry and commerce have gradually become active. Undoubtedly, it will now put on a new dress of prosperity. The water of the Yangtze River flows eastward, but the trend of urban prosperity seems to be rising westward step by step. Hankou wants to rival Shanghai, Chongqing wants to emulate Hankou, and Chengdu wants to follow Chongqing. Naturally, seeking the best yields average results, and seeking average yields below-average results. Chengdu is temporarily limited by material and technical conditions, and some things cannot be followed up. Even if the appearance is hard to imitate. Some things can be obtained, such as the surprisingly extravagant renovations of shops, the dazzling neon lights, the radio with the melodious sound of Chinese and Western songs, and even foreign ladies and gentlemen choosing Shu brocade beside the parking lane. The boy scouts standing on the street to direct traffic at dusk give people a certain impression that it looks like a foreign concession of Shanghai and Hankou. Some things cannot be followed up, such as not being able to build asphalt roads, but the "three-in-one" roads have to be smoothed and polished, and pure Western-style shops cannot be built, but the shop facade and windows have to be decorated with cement. Some things are a bit too much, especially in the area of enjoyment of the special classes. For example, on the night when the reporter first arrived in Chengdu, he was taken by the airport car to the "Sullivan," which Chengdu people called the best hotel. Going up a flight of stairs to the third floor, there was a room with size and equipment that could not catch up with a three-yuan room in Shanghai, but it was priced as high as five yuan and five corners, and it was not a Shanghai-style bathroom. But this is still a small room in the hotel. The prices of the rest are set at "seven yuan", "ten yuan" and "dozens of yuan." It is expected that travelers with low living standards in the inland will be surprised. When asked why, they learned that this is a place for special classes to call prostitutes and have other entertainment, that is, the "opening room" paradise that Shanghai people call. Some people even spend a lot of money to buy round-trip tickets for Shanghai-Chengdu aviation, and call famous prostitutes from Shanghai to have fun here, which is even more infuriating. (Mr. Deng Zhigu, director of the Eurasia Aviation Station, is humble to customers and once said "Passengers are either rich or noble." Now that he knows about this, I wonder what he will think? A smile!) Ordinary citizens like to drink tea very much, so there are many tea houses, five steps and a pavilion, ten steps and a building. Some people say: "Chengdu's telephone in the past was not a telephone but a joke." I said: "Chengdu's park is not a park but a tea garden." Indeed, no matter which park, there are rows of specially-made tea chairs, and they are full of leisurely tea customers, like an exhibition of high scholars, which makes people confused. Of course, there are also people who use drinking tea as a temporary exchange for business, but this is just a rare case. The vast majority of people seem to covet the special tea chairs, spend two or three copper coins on tea, and then leisurely lie down to spend half a day or a day, and then reluctantly drive back. The task attached to drinking tea is to listen to storytelling, watch operas, or comment on chess and fight birds. It is said that a goldfinch once won his master a very elegant house. The master regards it as his beloved son and does not sell it even if someone offers 500 yuan. Now it has been raised to twenty-three years old. I don't know how much effort has been spent? If this effort is used in other legitimate businesses, even if it is just beekeeping, rabbit raising, etc., it is estimated that the benefits will be more than what can be won by fighting birds? In addition, Chengdu people's leisure methods include going to taverns (different from restaurants), going to theaters, smoking opium, and planning to build dance halls, which are too numerous to mention. But all this is enough to vividly portray Chengdu, which is located deep in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Although its material construction is far inferior to the cities of Shanghai and Hankou, which it admires in the lower reaches, the happy life of the general rich and idle people is "better than the blue". As for the general working masses, although they were born in the land of abundance, they are clearly the people of hell. Although this is a flower-filled city, if you go to the vicinity of the imperial city in the center of this flower group to see the life of hell, where hunger and cold are intertwined, it will be "revealed on the spot". The reason for such a contradiction is nothing more than "the prime minister's platform is fat and the world is thin," which is "self-evident."</p>
<p>Chengdu is the ancient capital of the Shu Han Dynasty. The walls are high and thick, surrounded by river water, with a circumference of more than 30 miles. It was built by Zhang Yi during the Anshi period. The shape is beautiful and it is a famous city with historical and political significance in the four southern provinces. Now it is governed together with Huayang County. The streets are interconnected. Sitting in a rickshaw and patrolling, you can see that the house number is Chengdu, and in a blink of an eye it is Huayang. Among the merchants in Sichuan, Guizhou and Qian provinces, there is a saying "Chengdu passes Huayang County, - a county passes a county", which means that "county" and "present" are homophones, referring to not mentioning debt. There is also an imperial city inside the outer city, which is now the site of the National Chengdu University. I visited the provincial government authorities and took a brief tour. After passing through one courtyard after another, it just served as a joint office, and I could not help but sigh at the vast area. But according to a director: "The provincial government used to have a larger area, but it was a pity that many of the former provincial chairmen stole and sold it. Stealing and selling public property, it's simply stealing and selling the place where they put their own "chairs". It is really unheard of. In the director's bedroom, you can see books such as "Research on the Sino-Japanese Issue" and "History of Imperialist Aggression of Japan" placed on the bedside. It is said that other civil servants also use such books as the basis for their spare time research. According to Secretary General Mingjie, Sichuan Province is currently in a state of affairs: ㊀ Under the guidance of the central national policy, we will unite to deal with foreign countries; ㊁ Adjust the personnel system of the province and actively train civil servants at all levels, such as opening up county administration, financial statistics, Baojia, and agricultural and industrial technicians. training institute; ㊂ In terms of construction, transportation, water conservancy, and production are all highly valued, and efforts are made to develop all aspects equally. The Sichuan-Guizhou, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Sichuan-Hunan two highways have been opened to traffic. The provincial routes are more than 2,000 kilometers long, and they are still under construction. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has also started construction. Water conservancy has always used old methods and has not paid much attention to it. Now a new water conservancy bureau has been formed, and experts have been specially hired to be responsible. At the same time, local products will be improved and production will be increased. First, self-sufficiency will be sought, and then efforts will be made to transport and sell them outside the province and abroad. Later, a certain authority summed up a few words about how to deal with the national crisis: Externally, we will support the central government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and use the entire strength of the country to deal with diplomacy: Internally, all military personnel, students, and people are trained to use the opposite party as the monthly target. When China is forced to the point of no return by a certain country, there is no way out unless it fights it. From this statement, it can be seen that the people of Chengdu opened a magnificent flower of national spirit last autumn, and it was not a fluke.</p>
<p>The chaos in Sichuan in the past lasted for more than twenty years. The beautiful mountains and rivers, abundant products, and good people were used by ignorant warlords, resulting in various evils such as poverty and exhaustion of wealth. Fortunately, Liu Fucheng (Xiang) had the courage to personally come out of Kuimen and seek orders from the central government. He was aware of the greatness of the earth and opened his mind. He returned to Sichuan to form a new provincial government, unify power, and break the defense zone system. From then on, Sichuan's politics gradually became clearer. Recently, the heads of the construction halls have been appointed, and the achievements in construction are increasing day by day. According to the survey, if Sichuan's agriculture can improve seeds and completely eliminate tobacco and flowers, the province will still have surplus grain for 25 million people, but currently it is only enough to use. The Construction Department has now invited the Sichuan Agricultural College and the Central Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute to jointly form the Sichuan Rice and Wheat Improvement Institute to engage in seed improvement work. The results of silkworm raising using new spring seeds are very good. Sichuan people did not originally know how to breed autumn silkworms. Now, seeds have been purchased from Jiangsu for trials, and unexpected results have been obtained. Therefore, it is expected that the future of silk will be very promising. The sugar production is very large, and there are currently four experts researching improvements. The distribution of mining areas is not as much as in Hunan. Foreigners ideally believe that oil reserves must be rich, but in reality they are not. The gold, silver and copper ore layers are very thin, but the production of salt ore and iron ore is very abundant. However, there are not many miners and very few mechanical factories, so raw materials such as copper and iron still need to be sought from outside. The gradient of the rivers in Sichuan Province is very large, and there are 38 places where hydroelectric power plants can be built. However, the power generated must be used in conjunction with factories; otherwise, it seems inappropriate to only supply electric lights. For example, the upper reaches of the Minjiang River, in addition to artificial work dams that irrigate 5 million acres of land, can also generate a huge amount of electricity. It is estimated that it will not be used for what appropriate factory? The use of electricity in the province is limited to telephones and electric lights, and it has not yet been popularized in all counties. However, each county is equipped with a radio. The provincial government departments and security departments have important government orders broadcast by the Chengdu Radio Station, which can be spread to all counties without distance. This is indeed very effective in terms of government efficiency. Sichuan has always been known as a province with many soldiers. Even after reorganization and downsizing, it can still mobilize 50 to 100 regiments once a major national defense event occurs. I heard that the generals and soldiers are very happy to be ordered to do so. In short: Sichuan has abundant resources and its people are available. It is a pity that it is located deep in the interior and far from the sea. In addition, it is close to British territory, and the threat is everywhere. Therefore, it can be developed as a supply base for resources needed to revive the nation, but it cannot be regarded as the last support base for reviving the nation.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wu Gave Farewell Dinner to Yu Hanmou Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Introduced Yu to Leaders from All Sectors in Shanghai, Hoping for Cooperation in Resolving Guangdong's Difficulties</p>
<p>Yu Hanmou, the Pacification Commissioner stationed in Guangdong, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and is scheduled to return south on the President McKinley liner on the 5th. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet at the International Hotel yesterday at 12:30 PM to bid farewell to Yu and introduce him to leaders from all sectors of Shanghai. Those who attended include Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Xiaolin, Lin Kanghou, Liu Hongsheng, Qian Xinzhi, Huang Renzhi, Chen Jian'an, Tang Shoumin, Ye Zhuotang, Chen Guangfu, Wu Yunzhai, Wu Yunchu, Bei Songsun, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Chengxu, Guo Shun, Rong Zongjing, Xu Xinliu, Xu Jiyun, Yu Hongjun, Pan Gongzhan, Cai Jingjun, Xu Shengchan, Ji Xiadi, Hu Bijiang, Mu Ouchu, Cai Zengji, Yuan Ludeng, Guo Bingwen, Zhu Hanzhang, Wang Zhixin, Feng Youzhen, Ma Yinliang, Zhu Boqi, Hu Zhengzhi, Zhang Jiluan, Pan Gongbi, Yang Guangheng, Hu Pu'an, Dong Xian Guang, Cui Wei Wu, Qin Runqing, Lu Bohong, Lao Jingxiu, Gu Xinyi, Wang Yunwu, and Ye Fuxiao. Wen Zongni. A total of eighty-four people. The banquet began with</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Address, First Praising Yu</p>
<p>For his efforts last year to promote unity and break the decade-long stalemate in Guangdong at a time when the situation in the two Guangs was extremely tense. He then stated that Guangdong occupies a very important position in the country and is currently striving for construction, but faces many difficulties, such as: ㊀ The transportation problem, the most important of which is how to further improve after the opening of the Yuehan Railway. ㊁ The food problem, with Guangdong importing 70 to 80 million catties of rice annually. The current food shortage is causing panic and urgently needs to be relieved. ㊂ The currency system problem, with Guangdong traditionally using silver coins. Previously, the premium for silver coins against the silver dollar was about 25 to 30 percent. Since Guangdong implemented the legal tender, the premium for silver coin banknotes has only increased, resulting in higher prices. This also urgently needs to be reformed and rectified. ㊃ The commercial problem, with Guangdong being a commercial province, importing 160 million yuan worth of goods annually, half of which are agricultural products. Efforts should be made to stop the leakage of funds. Furthermore, the soil in Guangdong is suitable for growing sugarcane and making sugar. Our country also imports 30 to 40 million yuan worth of foreign sugar annually. If the sugar industry in Guangdong can be developed, it will also be of great benefit to the national economy. All of these issues require assistance from people across the country, especially leaders from all sectors of Shanghai, to the best of their ability.</p>
<p>Director Yu's Address</p>
<p>Next, Director Yu delivered an address. Yu's sincere and earnest attitude was praised by the attendees. Yu said that our country has been invaded and oppressed by imperialists for nearly a century and has suffered greatly. Guangdong was the first to come into contact with foreign countries, and Cantonese people were the most numerous in doing business abroad, so they suffered the most. Therefore, they first advocated revolution and overthrew autocracy. Since the death of President Sun Yat-sen, the revolution of our party suddenly lost its center. Fortunately, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was firm and persevering in leading the revolution, laying a solid foundation for the reward country. After the September 18th Incident, the country's steps became more difficult. I deeply felt that it was impossible to save the country from danger unless the whole country was united in good faith to resist foreign aggression. Therefore, when the two Guangs were brewing an incident last year, I resolutely obeyed the central government and promoted unity. When Chairman Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Guangdong, he encouraged us to build Guangdong into a model province for the whole country. Given the importance of Guangdong's position, we should strive to build it. However, Guangdong is not only Guangdong for the people of Guangdong, but also Guangdong for the whole country. I hope that people across the country will be able to help with the construction of Guangdong. Regarding the current difficulties in Guangdong, Mayor Wu has detailed them. Among them, the currency system and food are the most pressing. I especially hope that leaders from all sectors</p>
<h3>Fellow Hunanese Gave Banquet for He Jian Yesterday</h3>
<p>He Jian Talked About Hunan's Political Affairs During the Banquet, and the Province Had a Surplus of More Than One Million Yuan Last Year</p>
<p>According to Shenshi News Agency, Hunan Chairman He Jian came to Shanghai for official business. More than 200 local gentlemen from the province in Shanghai, including Zhao Yanwu, Zhang Xingyan, and Nie Lusheng, held a grand welcome meeting at the Hunan Fellow Villagers Association yesterday (the 2nd) afternoon at 4 o'clock. First, Mr. Zhang Xingyan delivered a speech, briefly saying that Hunan Province's construction has made rapid progress in recent years, the banditry has been wiped out, the society is stable, and the political achievements are remarkable. He praised the provincial government for establishing the National Martial Arts Hall and vigorously promoting mass sports. Then, He reported on the actual situation of Hunan's politics in recent years, briefly stating that the provincial government is committed to transportation construction, and the highway network has been completed as scheduled, and it can now be directly connected to the neighboring provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, and Jiangxi. The Yuehan Road has already been opened to traffic. Although Hunan Province's finances are very difficult, as a result of austerity and reorganization, the budget can be balanced. In terms of civil affairs, the Baojia has been completed, and after the security regiment has been downsized, it has been strictly trained. The combat power is comparable to that of the regular army, and the banditry in the province has been wiped out. The banditry in the Xiangxi area can also be wiped out completely in a short period of time. Education should actively promote compulsory education and add rural normal schools. The new education policy has been implemented in all secondary schools, and the study style has become pure and good. In addition, the results of planting tung trees in recent years have been good. The export value last year was more than 10 million yuan. Hunan Province originally had a surplus of 10 to 20 million yuan every year. Last year, there was a surplus of more than 1 million yuan. In the future, it will be committed to the national economic construction movement, actively promoting afforestation, and striving to improve agricultural technology in order to increase production, and hope that fellow villagers in Shanghai will enthusiastically invest. Finally, Mr. Zhao Yanwu delivered a speech, briefly saying that he hopes to ㊀ recruit various specialized talents and develop careers, ㊁ pay attention to training and organizing the masses, consolidate the foundation of national defense, ㊂ continue to promote national martial arts and promote the Hunanese's upright national spirit, and complete the work of saving the country.

After three hours, the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves and dispersed.</p>
<h3>International Wireless Telephone Call Between China and Germany Completed</h3>
<p>Held at Mr. Xu's Residence at 10 PM One Evening. The Voice Was Clear, Like a Domestic Call.</p>
<p>The Sino-German wireless telephone communication, after the Ministry of Communications ordered the Shanghai Telephone Bureau to be responsible for its preparation, has undergone several informal test calls. It is now known that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications officially conducted direct communication between China and Germany on the first of this month. The results were excellent. This official test call was held at 10 PM on the first at the private residence of Mr. Xu Xueyu, the director of the Telephone Bureau. Mr. Xu represented the Chinese side and held talks with the Director-General of the German State Wireless Telephone Company. The talks lasted about fifteen minutes. Afterwards, according to Mr. Xu's statements to the Shenzhou News Agency reporter, the test results showed that the voice was very clear and the sound was as loud as a domestic call. Therefore, after this test call, the technical aspect of Sino-German wireless telephone communication has been completed. It is said that the communication will be opened as soon as the two countries formally sign the contract. As for the Sino-American communication, the various procedures have been largely completed and will be opened in the near future. The official date is currently awaiting promulgation by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Mr. Patrick Departed for Guangzhou Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>To Investigate the Market Conditions in Southern China. Scheduled to Return to Shanghai Around the 15th. Denies That This Trip Is Related to Loans.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick, the special representative of the British Export Credits Guarantee Department stationed in China, accompanied by his wife, took the British company's "Nardala" ship to Hong Kong and then to Guangzhou at 3:30 PM yesterday to investigate the financial market conditions in southern China. His assistant, Mr. O'Reilly, will remain in Shanghai to continue investigating the work in Shanghai. Before his departure, Mr. Patrick met with a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency on board the ship. According to the conversation, he is only going to Guangzhou this time and does not intend to go to Hainan Island. He plans to visit the provincial chairman and other authorities and leaders from all walks of life in Guangdong, and plans to stay for only five days, starting his return journey on the 10th, and arriving back in Shanghai around the 15th. In the future, he also plans to go to Hangzhou, Hankou, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places, or may have to return to his country in June to report to the government and meet with manufacturers, and then come to China again in September. Rumors outside that Britain is providing loans to China, and that my trip to Guangdong is related to a 20 million construction loan to Guangdong Province, are not accurate at all. I do not know what the basis for such rumors is. It should be known that my mission in China is to investigate the market conditions in China. For example, after British manufacturers receive a notice from a Chinese businessman to purchase goods on credit, they can telegraph to me to inquire about the creditworthiness of this Chinese businessman in order to decide whether to establish a credit relationship. Since my arrival in China, I have never engaged in any loan negotiations with the Chinese authorities. Mr. Patrick also told the reporter that the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, will also be going south recently.</p>

<h3>It Is Said That General Fu Zuoyi Inscribed Commemorative Certificates for Purchasers of Coupons</h3>

The items were sold at a dice auction, and the collected funds were remitted. The association believes that Mr. Zhang's enthusiasm for patriotism is commendable, and it was decided to issue 10,000 Suiyuan Relief Donation Gift Certificates, priced at five yuan each, jointly with the Shanghai Women's Circles Suiyuan Bandit Suppression Comfort Association. It was also decided to present each purchaser of the certificate with a commemorative certificate inscribed by General Fu Zuoyi. The association sent a letter to General Fu to review and approve the agreed-upon method. At the same time, the donated items were numbered and displayed on the third floor of the Pudong Building on Avenue Edward VII for public exhibition, which attracted the attention of patriotic ladies from all walks of life in Shanghai. Enthusiastic people from other places, such as Chen Yifei from the Huai River Diversion Design and Survey Team of Linhuai Pass in Anhui, also sent letters and remitted funds to purchase coupons. It is now heard that General Fu has sent the commemorative certificate with his autograph from Suiyuan to Shanghai according to the method agreed upon by the association. The original text of the commemorative certificate is attached below: Mr. Zhang Rongchu and other members of the Shanghai Local Coordination Association have considered that the soldiers on the Suiyuan front are fighting against the bandits and serving the country. They have sold numbered coupons for their exquisite furniture, precious clothing, and famous calligraphy, and donated the proceeds to the front. We admire the generosity of the owners of the items and appreciate the nobility of the gentlemen who purchased the coupons. We are pleased to present this certificate as a souvenir. Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of Suiyuan Province.</p>
<h3>Commemorative Stamps at Post Offices Will Be Discontinued on April 1st</h3>
<p>Ordinary Stamps Can Be Exchanged for Six Months After Cancellation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Post Office issued a notice yesterday stating, "We have received an order from the Directorate General of Posts, which reads in part, 'The commemorative stamps for the 40th anniversary of the opening of the postal service were originally scheduled to be discontinued on April 1, 1937. Within three months after the discontinuation, i.e., from April 1 to June 30, 1937, they can still be used to pay postage. From July 1, 1937, they will be canceled and will not be allowed to be used. However, if the public holds these stamps, they are still allowed to exchange them for ordinary stamps of the same value at post offices within three months after the cancellation, i.e., from July 1 to September 30, 1937. We have ordered that this be notified to the public. Now, because the Postal Law has been implemented, according to the provisions of the law, the period for cancellation and exchange should be limited to six months, from July 1, 1937, to December 31, 1937.

<h3>Shanghai Fish Market Submits a Petition to the Ministry of Industry to Dispatch Warships to Protect Fisheries</h3>
<p>The Spring Flood Season Is Approaching, and Maritime Safety Is of Utmost Importance. Please Expedite Maritime Protection to Maintain Fisheries and Emphasize Production.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry has been open for nine months, and its business is growing daily. Under the guidance and supervision of the government, the market has made unremitting efforts to develop fisheries production and increase fish sales, which has been convenient for both fishermen and fish merchants. It is now heard that the board of directors of the market has submitted a petition to the Ministry of Industry, stating that the spring flood season is approaching, and maritime safety is of utmost importance, requesting that the Ministry of Industry quickly find a way to dispatch warships to protect fisheries. The original petition is recorded as follows: (Omitted above) Approved in the Public Letter No. 119 of February 22, 1937, from the Shanghai Fresh Fish Trade Association, stating that the fishermen and merchants have stated to the association that although the maritime protection business has been hosted by the government for a long time, due to the vastness of the ocean,</p>
<p>Pirates Are Rampant</p>
<p>There is often a risk of neglecting one aspect for another. Every fishing season, fishermen and merchants go to sea to buy fish, and the Shanghai port transfers funds, all relying on the maritime patrol ships as temporary floating banks. Fishermen and fish merchants jointly send personnel familiar with the fishing area to supervise the escort ships, shuttle back and forth, and distribute the funds according to the amount. Therefore, they often organize special protection to supplement the government's insufficient strength. In addition to the fishermen and merchants donating funds themselves, they also receive a large amount of subsidies from the Fresh Fish Trade Association, which enables the escort ships to depart on schedule every fishing season, allowing fishing boats to travel the ocean with protection and safe and smooth economic flow. Now, because your association is financially stretched, it has stopped subsidizing. The fishermen and merchants themselves are also unable to bear the burden due to poor business. Moreover, the original intention of the government to establish the Shanghai Fish Market was to</p>
<p>Relieve the Fishing Industry</p>
<p>As a prerequisite, if fishermen and merchants want their business to be stable, expanding the maritime protection business is particularly urgent. According to the business statistics of the Shanghai Fish Market last year, the turnover was no less than ten million yuan, and the commission income was considerable. However, so far, no measures have been taken to seek the welfare of fishermen and merchants. Now that the spring fishing season is approaching, it is time to allocate a part of the income to organize maritime protection, so that fishermen and merchants can be widely blessed. This is what we have been dreaming of, and we hope that the Fish Market authorities can take care of what is urgent for us. In addition to sending a letter directly to request, we also hope that your association will keep in mind the relationship of mutual dependence and send a letter to the board of directors of the Shanghai Fish Market, urging them to organize maritime protection as soon as possible to increase the business reputation of the market and to comply with the government's original purpose of relieving the fishing industry, etc. Upon verification, the matters stated in the association's letter are indeed true. At this moment, the spring fishing season is approaching, and maritime safety is especially important. It has always been known that your department attaches great importance to maritime protection measures. In the past, there was an establishment of a maritime protection office, with dedicated officials in charge, and the fishermen praised it. However, since the establishment of the market, the office has been revoked, and the maritime protection has been suspended in an invisible way. The fishermen have lost their security guarantee and have turned their anger on the market. The market is a business organization. As for</p>
<p>Maritime Safety</p>
<p>The issue belongs to the administrative scope and should not be interfered with excessively. However, considering that the maritime protection business is of great importance, if it is not prepared in time, it will not only damage the government's prestige but also lose the fishermen's faith, and it will also hinder fisheries production and affect the market's business. According to the letter, it is reasonable to submit a request to your association for review and approval, and to quickly consult the Ministry of the Navy to dispatch warships to protect fisheries in due course, so as to maintain fisheries and emphasize production, which is of great benefit. Respectfully submitted to the Ministry of Industry, the Board of Directors of the Shanghai Fish Market.</p>
<h3>The Relief Association Sends Letters to All Sectors Seeking Relief for the Bandit Disaster on the Gansu Border</h3>
<p>The bandit disaster on the Gansu border is extremely serious. The Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Relief Association has sent letters to all sectors of the city calling for relief. The original letter reads, "We have received a report from Commissioner Du Yannian of the Relief Committee, stating that the Gansu border area has recently been disturbed by remnant bandits, and the disaster is extremely serious. The general disaster victims are displaced, without clothes or food, and look like starving ghosts. What is even more unbearable is that the general disaster victims, and the women who are about to reach adulthood, are mostly naked, or even without shirts and pants. The cruelty of their suffering from cold and starvation is like a hell on earth. Please find a way to provide relief as soon as possible. In addition to publishing a notice to solicit relief, we hereby send a letter to you, hoping that you will have mercy on these survivors and generously provide relief funds to meet their urgent needs. If you are willing to donate clothing, whether new or old, single-layer or quilted jackets and pants, as long as they are enough to cover the body, they are all needed. Please donate and collect them as soon as possible, and hand them over to our association for distribution, so as to benefit the disaster victims in the border area. We are extremely grateful."</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Deported Back to China in the First Two Months of This Year</h3>
<p>A Total of Five Hundred and Six People. The Reason Is Unemployment.</p>

<p>Zhu Bao San Road, French Concession</p>
<h3>Peaceful Resolution of Conflict Between British and Italian Sailors</h3>
<p>Foreign Secretary Eden Reports in the House of Commons</p>
<p>Reuter, Biddon, 1st - A question regarding the conflict between British and Italian sailors on Rue Chu Pao San in the French Concession of Shanghai was raised in the British House of Commons today. The question was posed by Labour MP Mr. Burke, who inquired of the Foreign Secretary whether he was aware of the attack by Italian sailors on British military personnel and whether he would lodge a protest with the Italian government. Foreign Secretary Eden replied that, as far as he knew, the matter had been peacefully resolved by the officers of both sides. The Italian sailors had visited the British wounded in the hospital, presented gifts, and hosted a banquet on an Italian warship, inviting a portion of the British soldiers aboard for a friendly gathering. Therefore, the question of a protest was no longer relevant.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association Shanghai Branch Establishes Propaganda Slogans</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the China Aviation Construction Association is actively promoting the concentration of public strength to assist the government in developing the aviation construction industry, as detailed in previous reports.

The selected slogans are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Expand the aviation construction movement.</p>
<p>(2) Aviation construction is a patriotic movement and the duty of the people.</p>
<p>(3) To strengthen national defense, aviation construction is essential.</p>
<p>(4) Aviation construction is the vanguard of national defense.</p>
<p>(5) Aviation construction is a bulwark of national salvation.</p>
<p>(6) Aviation construction meets the needs of the times.</p>
<p>(7) National difficulties cannot be resolved without aviation construction.</p>

<p>(10) Compatriots, unite and strive for the aviation construction movement.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Office Submits Report Praising Voluntary Tax Payments</h3>
<p>Office Space Expanded</p>
<p>Since the implementation of income tax collection on October 1st of last year and January 1st of this year, foreign nationals and businesses, as well as interest on deposits, are subject to income tax collection on par with Chinese citizens. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been in contact with various countries regarding this matter, and it is expected to proceed smoothly. The Shanghai Income Tax Office has reported that recently, numerous Chinese employees of foreign firms and Chinese individuals with deposits in foreign banks have voluntarily paid their salary income tax and interest income tax. This spirit truly reflects the patriotism of our citizens, and their understanding of income tax is also becoming increasingly clear. Therefore, it has been decided to submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for commendation to encourage such behavior. Simultaneously, the office space of the Shanghai Income Tax Office in the original Jianghai Customs Building has become insufficient, so an additional room has been rented on the first floor of the Bank of China Building on Jiujiang Road to serve as the accounting department's office. They have already moved in, and the office in the Jianghai Customs Building is now dedicated to handling the submission of tax returns from all sectors.</p>

<p>The First Aircraft Has Already Taken Off from Berlin to China</p>
<p>After the resumption of the Ping-Yue (Beiping-Guangzhou) line, the Ping-Han (Beiping-Hankou) section, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation found that its original aircraft were insufficient, so it continued to lease two Junkers JU52 three-engine large aircraft from the German Lufthansa. The first aircraft took off from Berlin yesterday and will arrive in China via Greece, Turkey, Iran, India, Myanmar, Annam, and Hong Kong. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in nine days.

<h3>Workers at Ruirong Shipyard Resumed Work the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Workers' Demand to Sign Conditions Has Been Resolved Through Party and Government Mediation</p>
<p>The 500 workers at the British-owned Ruirong Shipyard in Yangshupu, Shanghai, had engaged in a joint slowdown strike to prompt the factory to acknowledge that they rejected the factory's abolishment of pre-arranged labor-management conditions and cancellation of union operational subsidies, after negotiations repeatedly failed. Party and government officials sent representatives to mediate once, but no results were achieved. However, party and government representatives were deeply concerned that the dispute would escalate, so they persuaded the workers to resume work first, and then wait for mediation on the terms. All the workers agreed to accept this, so they all resumed work on the morning of the day before yesterday, and all departments reported a return to normal. Subsequently, Zhou Xu Xiang, a standing committee member of the Municipal General Labour Union, together with Zhu Jintao from the Social Affairs Bureau and interpreter Fei Chang Nian, dispatched by the Municipal Party Department and Zhen Yinchu, went to the factory to meet with Assistant Manager Ai Mu and continue mediation. After lengthy consultations, four solutions were determined: (1) The factory acknowledges the subsidy for union operations of fifty yuan per month; (2) If the factory has operating surpluses, at the end of each year, a bonus of seven days' wages per worker will be issued; (3) Wages will be paid for holidays on revolutionary memorial days; (4) The working conditions for shift changes will remain the same. Since other factory rules were generally the same as the original conditions, they were no longer discussed. The workers were satisfied, and the dispute was declared resolved.</p>
<h3>Workers from Three British and American Factories Form a Mental Health Society</h3>
<p>Striving to Implement Labor-Management Coordination</p>
<p>According to Da Gong News, there are more than 3,000 male and female workers at the Xianzhong Tobacco Company (i.e., the Third Factory of the British American Tobacco Company) on Huade Road and Daobang Road in Hongkou, Shanghai. The relationship between labor and management is still relatively harmonious, but the lack of a group organization can still cause misunderstandings. Recently, Jiang Zongheng, Ni Abin, Xia Songling, Zhang Fang, Zhou Jun, Dai Beichen, Shen Wenming, Yang Antai, Chen Jintang, Yao Sangen, Yu Yu, Chen Bin, and other union members of the company, in order to eliminate such misunderstandings, connect the feelings of workers, and implement labor-management coordination, specifically discussed with Zhou Xuexiang, a standing committee member of the General Labour Union, and requested party and government agencies to initiate the organization of the Shanghai Jingcheng Mental Health Society. It is reported that the society has obtained a license certificate No. 601 from the Municipal Party Department, and is officially permitted to organize. The current address is No. 4 Houdefang, Daobang Road, Hongkou. The internal facilities include an elementary school for workers' children, a labourer's supplementary class, a martial arts field, a recreation room, a reading room, and a clinic. The atmosphere is quite new, and the factory has deeply understood this. It is said that the number of members joining one after another is extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Weights and Measures Formulates Methods for Using Stamps and Brands</h3>
<p>The National Bureau of Weights and Measures, in view of the fact that the techniques for using stamps and brands must be precise and refined, has formulated usage methods and ordered all provinces and cities to comply with them. The usage methods for stamps and brands are recorded below:</p>
<p>A) Stamps</p>
<p>(1) Stamps can be used to stamp the following materials: gold, nickel, aluminum, tin, zinc, lead, copper, various metals, various bamboo and wood materials, and other materials with a hardness less than steel.</p>
<p>(2) Pig iron and cast iron are too hard and should not be stamped with steel stamps. Weighing and measuring instruments made of pig iron or cast iron (such as balance weights) should be handled in accordance with Article 13 of the Revised Rules for the Implementation of the Chinese System of Weights and Measures. For materials that are not easy to stamp, a metal that is easy to stamp should be attached. The aforementioned attached metal must be tightly attached to the main body and not easy to detach.</p>
<p>(3) When stamping, slowly hammer the stamp; do not strike it violently at once.</p>
<p>(4) When stamping, use your left hand to slightly tilt the steel stamp left, right, forward, and backward, while simultaneously hitting it slowly with a hammer in your right hand.</p>
<p>(5) The weight of the hammer used for stamping shall not exceed half a kilogram.</p>
<p>(6) If there is dirt on the stamp head, it should be washed and cleaned before use.</p>
<p>B) Brands</p>
<p>(1) When the brand is placed in the fire, it must not be burned to red; it should only be heated to the point where it can make scorch marks on the material.</p>
<p>(2) When the brand is placed in the fire, direct burning of the brand head should be avoided. The highest point of the fire should be about one Chinese inch away from the brand head at the iron handle.</p>
<p>(3) If the brand accidentally turns red, it must not touch hard materials. It should be reused after the red color fades.</p>
<p>(4) After the brand has been used, it must not be left in the fire.</p>
<p>(5) If there is dirt on the brand head, it should be cleaned before use.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request for Correction of Excessive Egg Business Tax Collection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing:</p>
<p>"To the esteemed Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: Regarding the case of the Egg Industry Association's letter on the 27th of this month, stating that the Maocheng Company, a member of our association, reported that the Xiangxingzhuang agency in Yaowan Town reported that the collection of business tax in our area has always been handled in accordance with regulations, but since last year, the local business tax bureau has changed to intercepting collection along the way, collecting five to six cents per large piece, which is like a likin station and is extremely annoying. Negotiations have been ineffective, etc. Based on this, we hereby report to your association, please quickly find a way to stop this situation, etc. brought to the meeting. Accordingly, we find that the business tax bureau of Yaowan Town's practice of collecting taxes along the way and harassing egg merchants is clearly a violation of the Business Tax Law and the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Collection Regulations. Therefore, we hereby request your association to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to stop this practice, which will be greatly appreciated, etc. brought to the meeting. We checked Article 15 of the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Regulations revised for the fourth time in April of the 25th year of the Republic of China, which states, 'The business tax of this province shall be collected quarterly according to the whole year, but for businesses with special circumstances, it may be collected monthly or collected at once according to its business hours.' Also, we checked the Jiangsu Province Business Tax Classification Tax Rate Table, and the egg business tax is collected at five per thousand of the total business income. Therefore, the egg shop's business tax should be paid quarterly according to its total income, and even if it is not the current year's business, it should also be collected at once according to the regulations in the provisos of that article based on its total business income. There is absolutely no reason to set up checkpoints along the way and tax by piece. According to the previous letter, this is essentially a change of likin, the worst of tax policies. We should jointly send a telegram to your ministry for review and approval, and strictly implement corrections in accordance with regulations in order to maintain the tax system and facilitate public convenience. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce bows in gratitude."</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Sends Special Envoy to Survey Rivers in Pudong</h3>
<p>Issue of Rerouting the East and West Zhu Family Ditches</p>
<p>The Municipal Works Bureau plans to dredge the East and West Zhu Family Ditches in the Lixing District of Pudong this past winter, because the two ditches are located in the center of Lixing Town. Previous dredgings had not addressed the sections near Zhong River due to the presence of buildings on both banks. As a result, they have become unusually silted up over time. The Works Bureau has decided to open them to Dutaipu, but the local people have requested that the section near the town not be opened or that it be rerouted to avoid obstructing the town's housing. They also sent a letter to Mayor Wu through the Pudong Fellow-Townsmen Association, stating that dredging the river to facilitate water conservancy is meant to benefit the people. Since the people have made this request, Zhuo, a special envoy, was dispatched yesterday (the 2nd) to conduct an on-site survey, accompanied by Wu Jiangcheng, an engineer from the Labor Service Department, Zhang Bochu, a representative from the Fellow-Townsmen Association, and local people Qu Shaoyi, Tao Ganchen, Tao Qinwen, etc., to survey the East and West Zhu Family Ditches and the proposed rerouting locations. Finally, Zhuo told the Taos and others that the local people must clearly state their opinions, and that the municipal government will make accommodations if it benefits the local area.</p>
<h3>Regular Meeting of the Chinese Dental Association</h3>

Resolution: As the next regular meeting of the association conflicts with the Doctors' Association, the association will hold an extraordinary meeting on the 24th of this month and invite Yan Fuqing to attend and report on all plans.</p>
<p>(4) Lan Shou read a letter from Dr. John Jacob Posner, a famous American oral surgeon, stating that he will be passing through Shanghai around October of this year and asking whether any local colleagues are interested in organizing a special class to listen to his lectures in a short period of time. Resolution: First, Lan Shou will reply to the letter and discuss everything.</p>
<p>(5) What amendments should be made to the association's membership certificate format? Resolution: Passed and sent to print.</p>
<p>(6) Miscellaneous motions. The meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Nanking Road Residents Concerned About Security</h3>
<p>Send Letter to Police Station Urging Speedy Resolution of Bank Robbery and Increased Patrols to Avoid Future Incidents</p>
<p>The First District Branch of the Special First District Citizens' Federation and the Nanking Road Businessmen's Association yesterday, regarding the robbery of a cashier from the Nanking Road Transportation Bank branch on the morning of the day before yesterday, sent a letter to the Old Gate Police Station, stating: "To whom it may concern: It is reported that the Transportation Bank branch in the middle of Nanking Road was suddenly robbed of a large sum of money by bandits at approximately 11:00 AM yesterday morning. Although there was an attempt to arrest the bandits, they were injured, etc. As the area is located in a bustling downtown area, and the robbery occurred in broad daylight, the fact that bandits dared to appear and act with such impunity is completely unreasonable. If the bandits are not strictly apprehended, arrested, and brought to justice, how can commercial stability be maintained? Your police station has an unshirkable responsibility and should immediately issue arrest warrants, solve the case to deter bandits, and increase patrols daily to prevent similar incidents from continuing to occur and to protect merchants and residents. We would be deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>Taxpayers' Association Writes to the Municipal Council</h3>
<p>Requesting Collection of Rates Based on Actual Rent. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent two letters to the Municipal Council yesterday:</p>
<p>(1) "To whom it may concern: Wang Dingwei's letter states that his house at 700 Beijing Road has always been a house with three rooms and two wings, rented from the landlord Cao Zhiji for 132 yuan per month for nearly ten years. Since 1934, due to the construction of new-style Western-style houses in the eastern neighborhood and the impact of piling, which affected the construction of the front part of No. 700, he negotiated with Cao Zhiji in the spring of 1935 to modify the front part of the house into three shops and agreed to an additional rent of 68 yuan per month, totaling 200 yuan per month, including water fees. The three shops were all numbered 700. After being closed for a year, he only rented the western shop to someone to open Tongmaoxiang Copper and Tin Shop in mid-February of 1936. Because of the installation of electric lights and a meter, he received a letter from the power company informing him that the house number must be clearly distinguished to avoid errors when copying the electricity bill in the future, and instructed him to send a letter to the rates office to add sub-numbers to the house number. He immediately notified the rates office, but they did not come to copy and register the sub-numbers. Until the end of February, the rates office sent someone to collect rates and suddenly levied a huge amount, estimating the rent at 450 yuan per month. He stated in person that the rent was 200 yuan per month and presented Cao Zhiji's rent receipt as evidence, but there was no response. Until mid-April, they again brought a rate bill estimating the rent at 400 yuan per month to collect rates, and then in mid-June, they changed the estimate to 375 yuan per month. At this time, they suddenly added house numbers 696 and 698. Then they reduced the estimate to 370 yuan per month. This happened intermittently, and he suddenly received a summons from the court, suing the taxpayer to pay the full amount, etc. The rates office is resorting to an ostrich-like tactic and using a diversionary strategy. They ostensibly reduce the estimate of the rent, but secretly use the Yangjingbang Regulations to freely estimate the price and sue in court. Such manipulation chills the hearts of us taxpayers. Therefore, he hereby reports and begs your association to vigorously maintain justice. Such behaviour has been seen frequently recently, making people fear poverty even more than unrest. Since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai has been poor and has not yet recovered. If peace can be maintained, there will be a gradual recovery, which is what those responsible for political matters should do. However, they have forgotten to cultivate the source of taxation and are indulging in gathering and squeezing resources, not even considering that if the source of taxation decreases, where will the tax revenue come from? This is probably not the original intention of those who have been bathed in Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence. As for estimating the rent at 450 yuan, then 400 yuan, then 375 yuan, and then 370 yuan, if this is true, it is simply a bargaining business transaction. We believe that a fair agency would not do such a ridiculous thing. In short, collecting general rates based on the actual rent is the safest way and a necessary condition for the rule of law. Your council should correct this."</p>
<p>(2) "To whom it may concern: The Jin Cheng Bank Shanghai General Office's letter states, 'Our General Manager Zhou leased a house at 1171 Yuyuan Road from the Zhenye Real Estate Company last year for 500 yuan per month. All the patrol rates that should be paid should be paid in proportion to the actual monthly rent. However, at that time, the house urgently needed to be connected to water, and the water company would not connect it without proof that the tenant had paid the patrol rates. In order to connect the water quickly, we had no choice but to reluctantly agree to pay according to the Municipal Council's estimate of 500 taels of silver per month. After our General Manager Zhou moved out, the house was leased by Deputy Director Yuan of the Business Department of our General Manager Zhou's office. The monthly rent was still 500 yuan. The rent receipt for September of last year was taken by the Municipal Council for verification. The patrol rates that should be paid should be changed to the actual monthly rent of 500 yuan in accordance with the usual practice of renting houses in Shanghai to avoid differences. However, the Municipal Council has repeatedly ordered us to continue to pay according to its previous estimate of 500 taels of silver per month. If we do not comply, we will not be able to enjoy the rights of public use. Because we are forced by circumstances, we are sending this letter to you to seek justice and negotiate on our behalf. How should this be handled? We beg for a reply.' We find that collecting general rates without calculating the actual rent is, according to history, law, and facts, a gathering behaviour that completely disregards public interests. If this is not corrected, as those who have read Bentham's works know, the people's feelings of forbearance will inevitably be vented. As for the rights of public use, these are agencies maintained by public funds that should be responsible for providing services to the public. If the enjoyment of the rights of public use can be hindered and used as a tool for collecting taxes, then not enjoying the rights of public use, such as digging one's own well, not using tap water, providing one's own lights, not using electricity or natural gas, would mean that one would not have to bear the obligation of paying rates. Conversely, simply revoking the supply of the rights of public use would allow for the arbitrary addition of rates. After reading the legal history of the world, we fear that there is no such bad example. We ask your council to consider this matter carefully and correct this erroneous concept."</p>
<h3>Another Day of Heavy Fog in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in Shanghai recently has been inconsistent, with frequent shifts between sunny and rainy days, as well as variations in temperature. As a result, many people are suffering from colds and flu. According to Dr. Lu Baoyuan of Pushan Hospital, this is due to the weather. People should be careful about their daily lives and avoid imbalances in temperature. A few days ago, the weather was too cold, which is not suitable for spring. Therefore, today (i.e., yesterday) there was heavy fog all day, and even drizzling rain. The fog was especially heavy in the evening, to the point where one could not see one's fingers extended.</p>
<h3>Judges are Relaxed</h3>
<p>A Blessing for Society. Since the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office implemented the private prosecution system, where litigants directly bring private prosecutions to the criminal court, the cases handled by the prosecutor's office are provided by the Third Section of the Shanghai Police Department. On weekdays, the Third Section sends a minimum of twenty cases to the court for investigation each day, involving around fifty people. On Saturdays and Mondays, due to the intervening Sunday, the number of cases increases to forty or fifty, involving over a hundred people. As the police department is only meant to supplement the judiciary and has the authority to exercise judicial police powers when encountering ongoing offenses, the distribution of cases to each prosecutor is often insufficient. However, from the 27th of last month (i.e., Saturday) until yesterday, for four days, the police department did not send a single case, and each prosecutor was sitting idly. Some say that this year is a blessing for the nation and the region, as litigation is rare and the people are peaceful.</p>
<h3>Three People Attempt Suicide by Drowning at the Garden Bridge</h3>
<p>Fortunately, All Were Rescued</p>
<p>The Garden Bridge (白渡橋) outside the mouth of the Suzhou Creek has become a frequent location for suicide attempts due to the wide river channel below. However, it's rare for multiple people to seek death at the same bridge on the same day. Unexpectedly, on the day before yesterday afternoon, three individuals, both male and female, attempted to drown themselves in the river from the bridge within a few hours of each other, setting a new record for self-inflicted misfortune. Details of each case are recorded below:</p>
<p>Du Xingui, 34 years old, from Ningbo, used to work as a shop assistant in a pharmacy in his hometown. At the end of last year, due to poor business in the shop, there was a layoff. Du was among those dismissed. After losing his job, he managed to borrow some travel expenses from relatives and friends to seek a living in Shanghai. He stayed at the home of his brother, Du Xinhuai, at 281 Xichang Road, Laoximen. However, after staying in Shanghai for many days, he couldn't find a suitable job, leading him to become disillusioned with life. The day before yesterday afternoon at 1:30 PM, he attempted to drown himself by jumping into the river with his brother's knowledge. After being rescued by the Water Police, Detective Xu Lenian was dispatched to inform his brother to take him back and console him.</p>
<p>Zhou Sanmei, 33 years old, from Chongming, on the day before yesterday afternoon, had a quarrel with her aunt, Zhou Zhao. Zhao scolded her for being frivolous, associating with men outside, and disregarding her husband's reputation. Sanmei's face turned red and she was speechless. She left home alone, but found herself lost and without a place to go. Eventually, she ended up on the Garden Bridge and attempted to drown herself. Fortunately, she was rescued by Chinese police officers No. 52 and No. 104 from the Water Police and taken back to the police station. After questioning her and learning the details, Detective Wang Haiquan was dispatched to bring her aunt to the station. After some persuasion, she was ordered to take Sanmei back home to comfort her and prevent her from repeating the attempt.</p>
<p>Hu Yongfang, 25 years old, from Ningbo, used to work as a sailor on the Yihe Company's Longhe ship. In November of last year, due to the replacement of the head of the sailors, Hu lost his job along with him. After losing his job, he rented a place at 17 Xinji Pai Road, Hongkou. However, his income was cut off, and he gradually had no means to survive. The day before yesterday at 3:00 PM, he went out to borrow money but was unsuccessful. Extremely upset and disillusioned with life, he attempted to drown himself from the Garden Bridge. He was rescued by Chinese police officer No. 80-1 from the Water Police and taken back to the police station. After questioning him, it was discovered that he had no relatives in Shanghai, which was extremely pitiful. Detective Wang Haiquan was dispatched to send him to the Ningbo Fellow Association for assistance.</p>
<h3>Continued Trial of Sun Shaoqing, Accused of Soliciting Lawsuits and Extorting Money</h3>
<p>Investigation of the Sun Wu Case Completed, Sun Shaoqing Absolutely Denies Involvement</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing, from Tongzhou, residing at No. 28, Huayanli, Zhangjia Garden, Maitehesi Road, was arrested by Chief Chinese Inspector Lu Liankui and Chief Liu Zhaokui of the Public Concession Police for allegedly soliciting lawsuits and defrauding people of money. He was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the case was continued in the First Criminal Court by Judge Qian Hongye. First, the police lawyer, Ru Baoyi, stated that during the adjournment, the police had conducted a</p>
<p>Detailed Investigation</p>
<p>However, due to time constraints, they could not investigate every case handled by Sun. They only investigated the case of Sun Wu and Wu Dengrong (owner of Ruihui Silk Factory) regarding the division of property. Sun Wu's name was Gui Zhen, and she and Wu Dengrong were siblings. When Wu's father died, there was no inheritance. Later, Wu Dengrong started a business and accumulated considerable wealth. Sun Wu, through an introduction by Yao Yuebo, met Sun Shaoqing, who then filed a civil lawsuit for division of property and a criminal lawsuit for encroachment on her behalf. At that time, they demanded</p>
<p>200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>And Wu Dengrong had agreed to give 120,000 Yuan. However, Wu's son, Wu Shenbo, was unwilling and consulted lawyer Chen Tingrui. After Chen Tingrui consulted with Gu Gongbing, the lawyer representing Sun Wu, they settled for 40,000 Yuan. However, Sun Wu actually only received 12,500 Yuan. Several years later, Sun Wu reported the entire matter to the Hu She (Lake Society), because she was from Huzhou. The Hu She committee sent a letter to Wu Dengrong to investigate the actual amount paid, and Wu</p>
<p>Replied by Letter.</p>
<p>Now, the police have collected the evidence and are prosecuting him for extortion under Article 346 of the Criminal Law and for soliciting lawsuits under Article 157 of the same law. Then, Wu Shenbo was brought to the court and questioned about the process. He stated that his aunt, Sun Wu, first hired lawyer Chen Qun to send a letter to his father, and then he hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to handle the matter. Without going to court, they reached a settlement. He paid the 40,000 Yuan to Chen, who transferred it to Gu Gongbing, the lawyer for his aunt. He never</p>
<p>Met Sun Shaoqing.</p>
<p>Sun Shaoqing asked the court to prohibit the public from attending in order to discover the truth. After the audience left, Wu was questioned again. However, Wu's testimony remained the same. Judge Qian then questioned Sun. Sun absolutely denied the matter, saying that he did not know Sun Wu, had never met Wu Shenbo, and had not solicited any cases as described by the police. In Shanghai</p>
<p>There are many people</p>
<p>With the same name as me. How can you determine that the so-called Sun Shaoqing is me? Furthermore, I have always abided by the law for the past thirty years and have never committed any crimes. The court asked if he had any opium addiction. He replied that he had smoked it before but had quit. The court also informed him that he had participated in the Xu case support association. Sun replied that he did not know. Judge Qian verified the testimony and adjourned the case to the afternoon of the ninth of next month for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Naked Body in Sack Awaits Autopsy</h3>
<p>Determined to be Male</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese people on the barren land east of Pingliang Road and Ningwu Road planned to build a Dahua Printing Factory there. Unexpectedly, at about 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, Cai Rongqing, a worker from the Jiyun Company, discovered a naked body hidden in a sack about three or four inches underground while digging trenches to drive piles. He reported it to Matsumoto, a Japanese person, who informed the Yangshupu Police Station. Detective Liu Changgen and a Western detective went to investigate and found that the corpse was badly decomposed, and the chest and genitals were also blurred, so it was difficult to distinguish the gender at the time. They also investigated witnesses in the vicinity, but found nothing. They then transported the body to the forensic examination office on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor dispatched by the First Special District Court, arrived at the office to examine the body and determined that the body belonged to a male. However, the cause of death was unclear. He instructed two medical examiners, Wei and Zhang, to dissect the body for examination. After the autopsy, the body was handed over to the Pushan Mountain Villa for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Teahouse Tragedy</h3>
<p>Thugs Seek Revenge Twice; Shop Owner and Others Injured</p>
<p>Lu Lizhi, a man from Yangzhou in his twenties, lived on the Hujia Muqiao Road in Zhabei and worked as a ticket seller for the British Tramway Company. He was frivolous and rogue-like in nature. At about 1:00 PM the day before yesterday, he and a colleague named Kaimen Chang (姓名不詳) from tram No. 70 went to Caopeng on Qingyang Branch Road to tease women. This happened to be seen by the woman's uncle, Zhu Aixue, who reprimanded them in anger. Lu, shamed into anger, arranged to meet the uncle at the nearby Ruyi Teahouse at No. 51 to "have a talk." The teahouse owner, Xiong Jiankang (from Siyang, 37 years old), stepped in to dissuade them, and Lu left reluctantly. However, Lu felt he had lost face because of Xiong and plotted revenge. At around 1:00 AM yesterday morning, he suddenly gathered Yang Da Sizi, a strongman, Ding Xiaohai, a gangster, and about 40 others, each wielding iron bars, axes, and other weapons, and went to the Ruyi Teahouse to cause trouble. They first threw firecrackers and then rushed into the teahouse, regardless of the situation, dragging Xiong and the waiter Lu Zibin (from Siyang, 43 years old) out and hacking and beating them with axes and sticks. Xiong and Lu both suffered severe injuries to their shoulders, hands, and chests, bleeding and falling to the ground. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, Lu led the crowd to scatter and flee. Xiong's family members were shocked and ran to report to the Linping Road Police Station, which dispatched a large number of police officers to rush to the scene. They arrested the accomplices Qian Fusheng and Hu Baolian (each holding an axe and stick) and the main culprit Ding Xiaohai's father, Ding Dexi, Lu Lizhi's father-in-law, Wu Wenji, and four others, along with the weapons, and took them to the station. The two injured men were taken by car to Peisheng Hospital for treatment, where their injuries were quite serious. At about 1:30 AM, Wu Guibao, a member of Lu's gang, was unwilling to let his comrades be arrested. He gathered more than 20 people again, also wielding axes, sticks, and other weapons, and went to the Ruyi Teahouse, where they beat Xiong Lingdi (from Siyang, 23 years old), the owner's wife, causing her to bleed profusely from her chest and arms. They were then apprehended by the police on duty. All but Wu fled. After questioning the captured perpetrators, the police station, due to the case involving gathering crowds to cause injury and disrupt order, sent them to the General Bureau for interrogation. The main culprits who escaped, Yang Da Sizi, Lu Lizhi, the tram door opener No. 70, and Ding Xiaohai, are currently being closely pursued by the police.</p>
<h3>Seven Gold Shops Close</h3>
<p>Market Stagnant, Business Sluggish</p>
<p>According to the Xin Sheng News Agency, the Gold Industry Association of this city received letters yesterday from members Gu Maoqin Ji, Hongkang Yong, Fukang Qing Ji, Jinjue Yong, Haofeng, Runchang Yu, and Runchang Yong, stating that due to the sluggish market and poor business, the shareholders had decided to temporarily suspend trading and sales from today. Since the implementation of the legal currency policy, the exchange rate has stabilized and gold prices have not fluctuated greatly. Therefore, those engaged in the gold business have no opportunity for speculation and have had no choice but to honestly report their closure.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Factories' Products Participate in Hangzhou Handicraft Exhibition and Set Sail</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Products Factory Federation is leading domestic manufacturers to participate in the Hangzhou Handicraft Exhibition. Since issuing a notice soliciting participation, various manufacturers, considering that the Hangzhou exhibition will be held during the incense market season and that the number of tourists in Hangzhou will increase sharply, which is a good opportunity to promote domestic products, have been very enthusiastic to participate. More than twenty factories, including Sanxing Cotton Iron Factory, Hongzhang Textile Factory, Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Factory, and Meili Cosmetics Factory, have already registered. The federation has decided that the Hangzhou exhibition will open on March 20th and that packing will be completed on the 16th and departure will be on the 18th.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Bureau Resumes Longhai Intermodal Transportation</h3>

<h3>Two Railway Bureaus Improve Equipment at North Station</h3>
<p>No Passage Allowed Over the Dry Bridge for 24 Hours</p>
<p>The Jinghu and Huning-Ningbo Railway Bureaus are improving the construction and equipment of the North Station's train yard. According to the original plan, the bridge holes at the north end of the dry bridge need to be slightly modified. The Xihu Engineering Section will dispatch workers to carry out the work. It is estimated that this work will take about 24 hours in the shortest time. It has now been decided to start construction at 6:30 AM on March 3 (Thursday) and end at 6:00 AM on March 4 (Thursday). During this work period, all pedestrians are prohibited from passing through the dry bridge to avoid danger.

<h3>Liability Determined in the Fishmonger Truck Collision Case</h3>
<p>Zhang Genfu Found Guilty of Causing Death by Negligence; Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months Yesterday</p>
<p>On the morning of February 22nd at 9:45 AM, Zhang Genfu, a Ningbo native and driver of truck No. 16924 from the Fuji Transportation Company at No. 49, Jielu Road, was driving back from the fish market with 23 fishmongers on board. When passing near Guangxin Road on Yangshu Creek, traveling from east to west, truck No. 16499 from the Suhengmao Transportation Company, also carrying eight fishmongers, suddenly stopped. Zhang Genfu then tried to pass on the right, and the driver was careless, causing the</p>
<p>Fence Board to Break</p>
<p>Seven fishmongers fell from the truck, and three died from severe injuries: Wu Yongquan and Xu Ayue from Ningbo, and Bian Laoan from Jiangyin. After the Chinese and Western police arrived at the scene, they arrested the two truck drivers, Zhang Genfu and Wu Zhaoyuan, a Nanjing native and driver of the Suhengmao truck, and took them to the Yangshupu Police Station for interrogation and detention. Details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xiefei held a continued hearing in the 3rd Criminal Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, filed a public prosecution for</p>
<p>Professional Negligence</p>
<p>Under Article 276, Section 2 of the Criminal Code, and stated that the case was also suspected of involving Xiang Shanzhang, a Hua police officer from Anhui in prison guard No. 97, who was getting on truck No. 16499 of Wu Zhaoyuan when it stopped, causing the disaster. He denied it at the previous interrogation. However, the Hua police officer has now disappeared. Two fishmongers, Wang Abing and Shi Acai from Ningbo, who were on Wu Zhaoyuan's truck at the time, testified in court and stated that Chinese police officer No. 97 did run forward and used both hands to hold and block the road, signaling to stop, and then wanted to</p>
<p>Go to the Tilanqiao</p>
<p>Tram Station. At that time, Wu Zhaoyuan raised his hand to signal to Zhang Genfu's truck behind, but Zhang ignored it and continued to drive on the right side of his car, causing the accident. When asked, both defendants insisted on their own versions. Judge Xiao carefully examined the case and determined that Zhang Genfu's truck had the possibility of braking at that time, and he should not have passed on the right, and then driven on the left, causing the tragic accident. He sentenced Zhang Genfu to three years and six months of imprisonment for causing death by negligence in the course of his business as a warning, and Wu Zhaoyuan was found not guilty and released. Zhang's lawyer waived the right to appeal and he was immediately released.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Association to Study Income Tax</h3>
<p>Convened by the Shanghai Branch</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance implemented income tax on January 1 this year, the lawyer income tax problem in the free professional groups was proposed by the Guilin, Zhenjiang and other lawyer associations, requesting the National Lawyer Association to petition the authorities. The Association has appointed the Hangzhou, Shanghai, Jiangdu, Zhenjiang, Wuxian and other five lawyer associations to study the methods, and recommended the Shanghai Association as the convener. It is reported that the Shanghai Lawyers Association will convene the associations of Wuxian, Hangzhou, Jiangdu, Zhenjiang and other associations at the Standing Committee, invite representatives to hold a joint meeting in Shanghai in the near future to jointly study the issue of lawyers paying income tax.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association Bans the Excessive Issuance of Invitation Cards</h3>
<p>Such Unnecessary Socializing Runs Contrary to the New Life Movement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association believes that members and outsiders issue invitation cards indiscriminately for weddings, funerals, and celebrations, which is unnecessary socializing. It has been submitted to the joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees and decided to ban it. Activities such as Underworld birthdays, the removal of mourning clothes, and full-month celebrations for babies are contrary to the spirit of the New Life Movement's thrift. Three measures to ban it have been drafted and will be notified to all members for compliance. The drafted measures are as follows: ㊀ Members may issue notices for weddings, funerals, and birthdays of direct relatives, such as wedding invitations and obituaries. ㊁ No banquets may be held for celebrating birthdays before the age of sixty. ㊂ Members are not allowed to issue invitation cards for Underworld birthdays, the removal of mourning clothes, full-month celebrations for babies, and other unnecessary socializing, and are prohibited from entertaining.</p>

<h3>Ningbo Fellow Association Assists in Expanding the Ningbo Daily</h3>
<p>Members Receive a Free Month's Subscription Starting in April</p>
<p>The joint meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Ningbo Fellow Association of Shanghai decided to assist in the expansion of the Shanghai Ningbo Daily and drafted eight measures to assist. Details have been seen in previous reports. It is now reported that this year is the election year for the Association, and it has been decided to hold the annual meeting on the 28th of this month, and the election of new executive supervisors, foundation committee members will be announced on April 1. Work has been very intense in recent days. Regarding the assistance to the Shanghai Binbo Daily, the first item in the expansion measures is "New and old members will receive a free month's subscription." Because the Association has more than 100,000 new and old members, printing the header will take time, and the newspaper is currently printed on a flatbed press. Printing more than 100,000 copies daily requires switching to a rotary press. However, the installation of a new machine is not timely. After a detailed plan was determined, it was decided to reschedule the annual meeting to April 1, when the new executive supervisors and foundation committee members will be elected. The details will be announced to the various fellow associations in advance. It is also heard that the newspaper plans to hire several internal and external reporters (who must be from Ningbo) and apprentice newspaper deliverers. Those who wish to apply should first read the articles of association at the newspaper office.</p>

<h3>Nanshi Winter Relief Center Extends Relief Time</h3>
<p>More Than 3,000 People All Wish to Stay; Scheduled to End After Spring Warmth</p>
<p>Charitable people Wang Yiting, Huang Hanzhi, Qu Wenliu, and Gu Xinyi in this city established a temporary winter relief center at the Chaozhou Guild Hall in Nanshi last winter to accommodate refugees who were displaced. According to Zhang Zixin, director of the center, the center was established as a temporary nature and was scheduled to end this spring. However, the recent climate has been very cold, and most of the refugees adopted do not want to leave. It is now estimated that there are about 3,000 refugees in the center, most of whom are refugees from various provinces affected by disasters. Anhui, Gansu, Henan, and Hubei are the most, followed by Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, and Shaanxi. The number of unemployed poor people in this city is also large, followed by the elderly, weak, disabled, and young. The daily consumption of rice is about 20 stones.

<h3>Made Red Pills to Deceive, Kept Radio Loud All Day Long</h3>

<p>Xu Zhiqing, a Chinese detective chief of the New Gate Police Station, Wu Changkai, a detective, Yin Zhanxiang, and others, learned that in the attic of No. 73, Lane 432, Maybelle Road, someone had privately set up a red pill operation, secretly manufacturing and selling drugs.

They confiscated forty-one packages of red pills, loose</p>
<p>six pounds of red pills,</p>
<p>six pounds of raw materials for red pills, one and a half packs of white powder, one charcoal brazier, one stone mortar, one red pill mold, and two sieves. All were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Zhishan, prosecuted according to Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Drug Prohibition and stated the case. He said that when the police went to arrest them, they saw the two defendants were manufacturing and kneading red pills. The defendants knew that the sound of manufacturing red pills was quite loud, and they were afraid that the roommates would</p>
<p>discover their secret.</p>
<p>Therefore, a radio was placed in the room and kept on loudly all day to deceive others. They should be punished according to the law. When questioned, the defendant Li Zhibao confessed that he was a back rubber in a bathhouse. He met Wu A because he came to bathe. One day, Wu accompanied him to the Great New Company. Wu asked him to make red pills and took out eighty yuan as a start-up fee. Then Li contributed twenty yuan to buy equipment and rent a house to manufacture them. In the past two months, he had made them twice. Li earned a profit of</p>
<p>one-third,</p>
<p>and Wu paid him a monthly salary of thirty yuan. Chen Huangshi used to be a tea server in the Great New Company and had an affair with Li not long ago, etc. When questioned, Chen Huangshi gave evasive answers, denying helping to manufacture drugs. According to witness Yang Fuchang, "I am the second landlord of No. 73, Lane 432, Maybelle Road. In November last year, the two defendants, claiming to be a couple, came to rent the attic upstairs,</p>
<p>stating the rent</p>
<p>was seven yuan per month. Since the defendants moved in, they have always kept the door closed and entered and exited from the back door, so I did not know that they were manufacturing red pills, etc." Judge Chuan Lin believed that manufacturing drugs should be punished with the death penalty according to regulations, so he appointed a lawyer to defend the defendants. After the court debate on the case concluded, the sentencing was set for the morning of the 4th of this month, and the defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>

<h3>Post-Marital Weakness Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>...The causes of physical decline after marriage and effective remedies for the harms incurred.</p>
<p>...Excessive indulgence can damage the gonads, causing metabolic function to slow down.</p>
<p>...Effective treatments for kidney deficiency, infertility, developmental deficiencies, neurasthenia, etc.</p>
<p>Marriage is an inevitable matter in the minds of most people, so health after marriage is really worth discussing and studying.</p>
<p>Generally, it is said that the main condition for harmony between husband and wife is will and physique. The so-called will is a quality endowed by physique. To put it bluntly, those with a strong physique have a pure will. Those with a weak physique have a weak will. The so-called determination is completely controlled by physique, so physique is an important foundation for harmony between husband and wife.</p>
<p>If one is weak and sickly, or has kidney deficiency and infertility, it often becomes a fuse for rifts between husband and wife, and it is difficult for the family to be complete, and happiness is, of course, hopeless.</p>
<p>Those who have always been physically weak, or who have committed self-flagellation and nocturnal emission, will find that the degree of post-marital weakness becomes more profound. There are also those who were extremely healthy before marriage, but after entering married life, their bodies suddenly became thin, and at the same time, their vitality declined, and the functions of human beings became weaker and weaker, even completely lost! Marriage is originally a pursuit of happiness. If, after marriage, not only is what was expected not realized, but it is harmful to the body, what misfortune is this! We will now investigate these reasons in detail, and we can draw the following conclusions: Those who are weak after marriage, apart from the problem of incorrect physical compatibility, are mostly due to sexual indulgence. Because marriage is the beginning of the realization of human function, if it is excessively indulged and not restrained, then unknowingly, the precious body is injured, resulting in a sickly appearance. As a result, men are prone to kidney deficiency and impotence, developmental deficiencies, seminal thinness, and weak minds. Women are prone to menstrual irregularities, breast pain, and loss of health. If the body is excessively weak, vaginal discharge cannot be avoided, and the hope of pregnancy is extremely difficult to realize.</p>
<p>In short, to eliminate this obstacle, whether before or after marriage, the method of cultivating and nourishing the youth glands (i.e., gonads) can be used to eradicate it. It is best to take "Hiratol Tonic Pills" to treat spermatorrhea as soon as it is discovered before marriage, and then the symptoms of weakness after marriage can be avoided. Long-term spermatorrhea can cause everything to fall into a state of decline. This is said before the symptoms of spermatorrhea have caused harm. If the symptoms worsen and cause neurasthenia, developmental deficiencies, kidney deficiency and impotence, premature aging, etc., "Germinon," a preparation of gonadal hormones, should be taken to turn the weakened gonads from weak to strong, and all functions will be restored. As for women's menstrual irregularities, infertility after marriage, and breast health loss, "Germinon" for women should be taken to treat them. If there is leucorrhea, "Leukorrhea Cure" can be used externally to make the woman's vaginal tract clean, and leucorrhea will be cured immediately, so that healthy children can be produced, which can be expected.</p>
<p>Health Secrets</p>
<h3>The Latest Method for Treating Masturbation and Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>...According to research by famous scholars, most children have a tendency to masturbate.</p>
<p>...To correct masturbation, one must have a pure heart and few desires, and improve one's will in order to quit.</p>
<p>The so-called evil habit of masturbation in youth is a vile act that completely violates physiology. Regarding its harms, we do not need to explain in detail. Just look at the meaning of the two words "masturbation" and you will suddenly understand.</p>
<p>However, no matter how hard doctors and brothers try to persuade young people not to commit this act of masturbation, almost all adolescent men and women indulge in it abnormally. This is really a terrible phenomenon, so here we will first record its origin, describe its poison, and reveal how to prevent and correct it, and dare to bother those who know about it to add an examination.</p>
<p>According to research by many scholars, it has been proven that more than 70% of children have a tendency to masturbate. It first starts at the age of eight to ten, but in this period, the proportion is still quite small, and it gradually increases from the age of eleven. At the age of fifteen or sixteen, the proportion is the highest. Masturbation in childhood can hinder development, and neurasthenia is extremely severe. Moreover, the whole person falls into the terror of frequent nocturnal emission, so his future happiness is completely buried at this time.</p>
<p>Sexual disease experts, American medical doctor Newell Wilder, German famous doctor Mano Tor, British physiologist Bolton, and others have proven that 80% of those who suffer from kidney deficiency and impotence and infertility after marriage are caused by masturbation and nocturnal emission. Therefore, the most important gonads in the human body are weakened and unhealthy, and as a result, there is no hope of health. Therefore, the method of treatment should be to take "Hymitol Tonic Pills" to stop nocturnal emission, and at the same time, stock gonadal hormone preparation "Germinon" to restrain all the harms caused by nocturnal emission. And it is necessary to resolutely quit masturbation. Regarding the correction method of masturbation, the most important thing is to have a clear heart and few desires, improve one's will, and avoid bad contacts. All of these should be followed by those who masturbate.</p>

<h3>The Road to Success in Female Breast Beauty</h3>
<p>...Wrinkles on the face are just as annoying, all of which are due to premature aging of the gonads.</p>
<p>...If women only seek delicate appearance, it is useless, they must have towering and plump breasts.</p>
<p>If a woman cannot obtain good development during maturity, then the breasts must be atrophied and cannot be towering, and at the same time, the curve of the buttocks cannot be revealed. Such a person is, of course, not beautiful and healthy. The same tragic and troubled as women who cannot give birth.</p>
<p>In addition, what makes women most suffocated and miserable is that their faces are old and full of wrinkles. The former completely affects health and beauty, and the latter is a catastrophe on the face.</p>
<p>General women, they are already aware now, they know that it is useless to only seek a delicate appearance. Therefore, it is necessary to seek the beauty of the body, and it is considered perfect to have plump buttocks and reveal curves!</p>
<p>Regarding the occurrence of shriveled breasts and wrinkles in women, Dr. Venice, a famous French beauty expert, confirmed that this is entirely due to premature aging of the youth glands (i.e., gonads). Therefore, it affects the digestive organs and metabolic capacity. If you can take the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinon" for women, you can make the shriveled breasts suddenly towering, the menstruation is adjusted, and everything can be kept young forever. Middle-aged women who take it can also eliminate wrinkles on the face. "Germinon" for women is indeed of aesthetic value.</p>
<h3>The Most Advanced Gonorrhea Self-Therapy</h3>
<p>Gonorrhea is the most stubborn and difficult-to-treat infectious disease among venereal diseases, which no one can deny. Therefore, thousands of hundreds of gonorrhea drugs have been introduced to the world, but the gonococcus cannot be completely eliminated. However, some of them missed the opportunity for treatment and became deteriorated. Some of them formed an incurable state due to improper care. In addition to this, most of them were misled by medicine. Because if gonorrhea can be treated through proper channels during the acute phase, without delaying the time, according to the treatment procedure of Dr. Hotson, a famous German gonorrhea expert, taking "Antilin," a preparation made of yellow pigment and vaccine, can be quickly cured. According to the doctor's confirmation, in the clinical experimental records, of every two thousand gonorrhea patients who were completely treated with "Antilin," as many as 1,800 people were cured, and the percentage of patients whose condition was reduced accounted for about 20%. Because the drug contains a large number of bacterial vaccines that resist gonococcus and has the power to penetrate the membrane and kill bacteria, it can wipe out the gonococcus gathered in the back section of the urinary system, eliminate the risk of complication, and all gonorrheal orchitis, cystitis, prostatitis, etc., will be cured immediately after taking this medicine.</p>
<h3>Female Physiognomist Accused of Abetting Theft</h3>
<p>The case is complicated and still needs to be investigated in detail</p>
<p>Zhao Juexian, a female physiognomist from Anhui, is thirty-four years old this year. She is currently running a business in Room 310, 3rd Floor, Oriental Hotel, Xizang Road, Public Concession. At 7 PM the day before yesterday, she was arrested by the French police for a case of abetting theft. Yesterday morning, she was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special Court. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated her. The lawyer of the Police Department stated the case, saying that the investigation had not been completed and requested that the defendant be detained temporarily, and the investigation should be carried out later. Then, the investigating officer reported that on September 1 last year, Wu Duanshi reported to the Central Police Station that her adopted daughter, Wu Dezhen, stole four gold bead buckles, a handbag, and five yuan in cash and escaped. She requested investigation and arrest. Now, it was found that the defendant was suspected of abetting theft, so she was arrested and requested to be postponed for investigation, etc. When questioned, the defendant Zhao Juexian confessed that she had known Wu Duanshi before. Last year, on Malan Road, she met Wu Dezhen and asked her. According to her, she was abused and beaten by her master, so she went out and got lost. At that time, she took her back and planned to send her back to Wu Duanshi's house. Unexpectedly, Wu Duanshi had already moved and did not know her address. Later, because Wu Dezhen was from Sichuan, she had a female friend from Sichuan, Miss Wang (living in Room 114, Central Hotel). She planned to find a way to take Dezhen back to her hometown. The reason for this incident was that recently a detective named Shen Jinsheng from the Central Police Station came to the defendant's place and caught sight of the girl. At that time, he said that the girl was abducted by the defendant and demanded 200 yuan from the defendant, but he failed, so he informed on the defendant for abetting theft, reported to the French police, and arrested her. She did not abet theft. The court verified the confession and approved the postponement of the investigation for further interrogation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Contribution Talk Strategy China National Goods United Sales Company</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>The China National Goods United Sales Company has been established for some time. At present, the biggest task in preparation is to raise shares. However, the most urgent work includes three aspects:</p>
<p>First, what is the content of the national goods companies that have been established in various places? What is the business like? What kind of goods are selling well? What kind of goods are selling slowly? What are the feelings of the local people about them? What should be improved in the future? Secondly, what is the status of production and sales of national goods in various places? Is it possible to establish a national goods company? How is the local cooperative being run? Can it be contacted? All of these are points that should be paid attention to in the preparation work.</p>
<p>The second is design. Based on the findings of the survey, we will begin to determine which places should be established first, which places should be established next, how the business should be run, how much capital is needed, where the location should be, how to start the preparation, how to contact the local people, and how to cooperate effectively with the financial community. This is the initial stage of design.</p>
<p>The third is promotion. The area of national goods will become wider and wider in the future. Promotion work is indispensable. Special personnel should be assigned to make contact and go to various places to make practical connections. Or use newspaper publicity, or take lectures, or seminars, so that the joint venture of national goods can go deep into the interior, become a household name, and reach no distance, so as to truly realize the function of the liaison organization.</p>
<h3>Regarding Hopes for the "Civil Servant National Products Year"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>Many groups dedicated to promoting national products have already designated this year as the "Civil Servant National Products Year," and are actively preparing to unveil its commencement. Everyone's attention will naturally be focused on this year with its promising future, filled with renewed hopes for progress.</p>
<p>At this time, I personally deeply feel that "empty words are useless, practice is paramount," which is a clear lesson from history and also the guideline for us to engage in developing national products in the future. Therefore, here, I write down three of the most basic and heartfelt hopes that can be implemented and achieved within this year.</p>
<p>First, I hope that all national civil servants, who are the center of this year's national products movement, should unitedly and dutifully take the lead, setting an example for the nation's populace to strive to use national products. In particular, within this year, they should (A) correct and eliminate the remaining foreign goods worship mentality of a small number of people in the country, and (B) promote various national products campaigns in society.</p>
<p>Second, I hope that the industrial circles of the country can still, this year, uphold the spirit of burying themselves in hard work, and the established policy, actively proceed to strive to expand overseas markets, so that foreign trade has a better trend, and establish and expand the National Products United Operations Company, laying the most solid and unshakable foundation for the production and sales of national products.</p>
<p>Third, I hope that people from all walks of life across the country can, starting this year, have a deeper understanding and recognition of the seriousness of our current economic national crisis, and that promoting national products is a matter of the survival of our entire nation. Everyone should unite and follow the national civil servants, and strive for the national products movement.</p>
<h3>An Investigation of National Cement Production</h3>
<p>— Bao</p>
<p>I recently saw an article in the newspaper entitled "How to Consolidate the Economic Foundation," and deeply admired its profound insights. However, the statement that "recently, cement has been in slight demand due to construction projects, and we cannot but seek it from Japanese goods" does not accord with the facts. According to the state of production and sales of cement in our country, the supply currently exceeds the demand. I will now list the domestic cement production as follows:</p>
<p>Judging from the cement production, it is indeed surplus, and there is no need to rely on imported cement. In terms of price, the recent Shanghai Municipal Council's bidding for cement showed that the bid price for foreign cement, bagged, was seven yuan and thirty-four cents per barrel, while the bid price for domestic cement, bagged, was six yuan and fourteen cents per barrel. Foreign goods cannot compete with domestic goods. However, the market prices of all materials continue to rise, which will affect the manufacturing costs of domestic cement.</p>
<p>The demand for cement will not increase significantly before October of this year. Both the Qixin and China Cement factories have automatically reduced their production. After October, the demand will increase slightly. Although the Guangdong situation has been settled and excessive taxes have been abolished, the transportation of goods to Guangdong is congested, and there is a lack of ships, which has slightly delayed the shipment of goods from the Qixin factory from Tanggu to Shanghai. In addition, due to the urgent diplomatic situation, the railway bureau has not been able to fully supply vehicles for the transportation of goods, so the freight transportation of the Longtan China Cement factory has also been slightly hindered. However, through the efforts of the factories, the situation has long been restored to its original state, and the supply of goods is normal. Therefore, there is no shortage of domestic cement at present. I am afraid that the outside world will misunderstand, so I will not hesitate to use my words to express it, and offer it as an aid to the investigation of domestic commercial affairs.</p>
<h3>Impressions of the National Manufactured Goods Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zhang Baling</p>
<p>The "National Manufactured Goods Exhibition" organized by the Jianghai Customs has opened on January 24th. In this country with a backward industry, where the manufacturing industry is abnormally pitiable, and where the import of foreign goods still occupies a considerable share, the Jianghai Customs is able to collect the manufactured products of various national goods factories for a large-scale exhibition, giving the general public an opportunity to recognize the degree of progress of our national manufactured goods, and thereby arouse their determination to use national goods, which is not without value and significance.</p>
<p>The exhibition hall is located on the third floor of the Jianghai Customs, and the space is quite large. The author took the time to visit it the day before yesterday morning, and the impressions were very good. Here is a summary of the impressions:</p>
<p>In addition to this, the yarn samples and patterns of the Xin Shen Yarn Factory are also very lovely; the various wire nails of the Gongqin Iron Factory, arranged into a beautiful landscape painting, are even more commendable.</p>
<p>Various other porcelain products, glass products, hemp products, silk fabrics, rubber products, knitwear, woolen fabrics, chemical drugs, canned products, cosmetics, ornaments, various machines, etc., are displayed in a colorful manner, giving the audience a good impression that our Chinese manufactured goods have made considerable progress through the efforts of the production industry.</p>
<p>On the way home, the author silently thought: This National Manufactured Goods Exhibition organized by the Jianghai Customs is of great significance. It is hoped that since this public exhibition, it will promote the recognition of national goods by the general public, and further increase their interest in promoting and using them.</p>
<p>The types of national manufactured goods solicited by the Jianghai Customs this time are numerous, no less than six or seven thousand kinds, and there are also more than 700 national goods factories participating, which is indeed a large-scale exhibition. The most notable items on display are the various electrical appliances of the Construction Committee, such as electric stoves, electric fans, generators, etc., the styles are very beautiful, and on each item, there is a description explaining the source of the raw materials, the method of use, and the selling price, so that visitors can invisibly increase some electrical knowledge. The second most notable items are various toys, such as birds and animals, airplanes, gas masks, tanks, cars, etc., the structure is also very sophisticated, and compared with imported goods, it is even better. These toys are mostly produced by the Kangyuan factory, which is enough to improve children's knowledge, enlighten children's thoughts, and increase children's interest in studying national defense issues, which is also very meaningful.</p>
<p>In addition to this, the yarn samples and patterns of the Xin Shen Yarn Factory are also very lovely; the various wire nails of the Gongqin Iron Factory, arranged into a beautiful landscape painting, are even more commendable.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Sales (3)</h3>
<p>— Ding Kai</p>
<p>Here, let me introduce some anecdotes of success due to the psychology of association.</p>
<p>The sales manager of Ford Motor Company in the United States has a special understanding of identifying customer credit. He has been in office for more than ten years. Most of his daily work is spent meeting buyers or visiting customers. He is not only fully responsible for bookkeeping or cash sales in transactions, but also makes decisive decisions at any time. On the one hand, he relies on the investigation of customer credit, and on the other hand, he distinguishes the creditworthiness of the buyer from the moment he shakes hands with the guest. He also makes a very interesting record of "large and hard" "small and hard" "large and soft" palms. It is said that this kind of discrimination is scientific and not very wrong, because it has been obtained from more than ten years of experience and the handshake experience of tens of thousands of people.</p>
<p>There is a Matsushita grocery and food store in Japan. The female store owner, "Miyochi," has always been known for her ability. She always treats the many housewives who enter the store every morning with kindness, or helps the store clerks to greet them. She often says to the store clerks, "If the housewife who comes today has suddenly dressed somewhat stimulatingly, and her hair is tied up as if only half-done, and when she enters the door, she is in such a hurry, and although her face has not been powdered, she shows a happy smile, we should advise her to buy more fish, meat, and vegetables, or a chicken, because experience tells us that this housewife has a distinguished guest at home."</p>
<p>The Rowntree Company in the UK is a well-known giant in the European confectionery industry. Before the launch of its "Black Magic Chocolate," the company decided to conduct a market analysis. They widely tested various tastes among the general public, and also solicited opinions from the public on the color matching of the packaging. As a result, the Black Magic Chocolate achieved amazing success in its launch.</p>
<h3>A Description of Ms. Xu Quhong's Fundamental Methods for Promoting National Products (Continued from Issue 201)</h3>
<p>— Ms. Lin Wen</p>
<p>㊃ I hope to establish a National Products Consulting Center jointly with merchants and factories. The center should have a consulting department (including both written and face-to-face inquiries), a design department, a mail order department, and a telephone purchasing department. The consulting department will be used for general inquiries from those who do not know how to identify the authenticity of national products through written or face-to-face inquiries. The design department will be responsible for designing on behalf of others. For example, if women in various provinces and cities order national products clothing, as long as they specify the size and indicate the amount of money they plan to spend, the department will design, select materials, and manufacture them within a limited time and send them by mail. In this way, national products can be actively promoted and convenience can be provided to people, which may be a shortcut to promote national products. The mail order department is in charge of mailing, but the selection of goods must be based on caution to show credibility. The telephone purchasing department should prioritize the delivery of goods with agility. (Note: The Sanyou Industrial Society has already implemented this.)</p>
<p>㊄ I hope that the Chinese National Products Company will find a way to issue a kind of competitive purchasing award certificate (this certificate can be printed with some simple aphorisms to awaken the public), and send it to each family during the visit. This kind of award certificate can be brought to the company for registration each time you shop. Check once every quarter or year, and the one who buys the most goods (can be divided into first, second, third place...) can be given a commemorative award. This method is more valuable than giving out various theater vouchers. The Tianjin National Products Sales Office has used this method to great effect, and Shanghai can explore this method to promote it!</p>
<p>㊅ I hope that various national goods manufacturers will find ways to cultivate specialized talents. For example, the current domestic pigments have not yet produced excellent and applicable products, so that no matter what kind of cloth, the pigments that do not fade must be supplied from foreign countries. Various manufacturers should find ways to plug this large leakage, and cultivate this kind of talent. Each manufacturer should take a percentage of the annual surplus as a subsidy, so that other students who return to China after studying will make the greatest contribution and serve the factory.</p>
<p>㊅ It is best if the National Products Company can set up small-scale branch companies on various roads. Shanghai is so big that people cannot be required to run to the Mainland Commercial Field to buy everything. Set up these small shops to facilitate the purchase of nearby customers. Prepare more daily necessities to absorb the purchasing power of ordinary people, and cultivate their habit of loving national products. Otherwise, people who are generally provincial will inevitably neglect small things and buy cheap foreign goods at will.</p>
<p>Ms. Xu is a woman with rich experience and forward-looking thinking. She has always been happy to use national products. When she was in Tianjin, she encountered many difficulties in using national products and the ridicule of her relatives and friends, but she decided to adhere to the thorough spirit of attitude for decades! Women compatriots, you must know that women cannot serve on the battlefield, your greatest responsibility is: to educate your children in the family so that they can serve the country in the future; and for the tasks of society and the country, you must shoulder the easy task of promoting national products and the responsibility of being happy to use national products? As long as everyone has a selfless spirit, whenever you buy something, you must think about where the money is going, and do not buy foreign goods with every penny in your pocket. At the same time, you can inquire about the store clerk with a sincere attitude of loving national products, and pay attention to the trademark. Then they will definitely not answer you unfaithfully. And the annual import surplus problem can naturally be broken by everyone's concerted efforts?</p>
<h3>Recollections of the Women's National Products Association (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Jian Hua</p>
<p>However, the situation at that meeting gave me a very "bad" impression. The order of the day was chaotic, the voices were noisy, and the speakers on the stage, though engrossed and red-faced, were still talked and laughed at by the audience. During the voting, people ignored the chairman's instructions and guidance, simply scribbled a few names, dropped them into the ballot box, and went to collect gifts on their own. When collecting gifts, people rushed and pushed, causing the goods to be mismatched and impossible to verify, resulting in statements that it was okay to take them at random, making it difficult for the organizers to know what to do. Such situations were endless. In summary, they seem to be no more than the following two points: ㊀ Women neglect spirit too much ㊁ Women value material things too much.</p>
<p>Regarding the first point, I hope that women, in future gatherings of this kind of national products movement (because the national products movement, that is, the national products movement, in fact, all gatherings should be like this) first "solemn and respectful" "silent and calm" do not talk freely unless there is an opinion to be expressed, and do not leave the seat without authorization unless there is an important matter. Voting must be carried out in accordance with the method instructed by the chairman, and it is also necessary to recognize whether the elected person is suitable for the position.</p>
<p>Regarding the second point, most of the gifts are enthusiastically solicited from various parties, and the organizers are obliged to distribute them. Those who receive the gifts should not regard this unexpected harvest as a vested interest. It is gratifying to receive them, and there is nothing to complain about if they are lost. When collecting gifts, you should follow the order number to avoid errors, on the one hand, to avoid making it difficult for the organizers, and on the other hand, to avoid being laughed at by those who know better.</p>
<p>The above two points are based on the facts at the time, and are specially raised by the author, please reflect deeply on them in our women's circles. As for the fact that there were many people who could abide by the order at that time, those in the above situation were only a minority, but it is still hoped that everyone will "correct if you have them, and encourage if you don't."</p>
<h3>The National Goods Sector in One Week</h3>
<p>Shou Moqing, manager of the Guangzhou National Products Company, came to Shanghai to contact various parties to prepare for the opening of a national products exhibition in Guangdong.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has set a special price for the freight of domestic educational supplies.</p>
<p>The Hebei Province Handicraft Exhibition opened on February 25, and the Jiangsu Province Handicraft Exhibition opened on March 1.</p>

<p>Mr. Qian Xinzhai announced the recent progress of the China National Products United Operations Company, and said that the stock funds can be fully paid soon, and the future is very promising.</p>
<p>Shanghai's national goods groups suggested that the New Games advocate the Civil Servant National Products Year.</p>
<p>The Dutch shield depreciated, and the export of national goods to Nanyang was very smooth. The China Foreign Trade Association is watching the hand to proceed.</p>
<p>The China Industrial Foreign Trade Association and the Singapore Bank of China jointly run the Singapore National Products Exhibition Hall, and there are already more than 20 participating manufacturers.</p>

<h3>Haiqing Defeats Xiqing in Western Youth Volleyball League Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reversing the Loss After Losing the First Set</p>
<p>Western Youth Group A volleyball, since Haiqing accidentally suffered a crushing defeat to the Russian army last week, the championship that they were very confident in has been shaken, making the Xiqing team, who had defeated the Russian army, have a great momentum to catch up. Yesterday night, Haiqing and Xiqing met, which is the key to whether Haiqing can retain the championship, and also the final decision of Haiqing's fate this year. Chinese and Western spectators also had good eyesight, predicting that this game must be exciting, so hundreds of people gathered to watch. With the help of the fierce general Borokofev, Xiqing's momentum was extremely strong. Not long after the battle, Xiqing took the lead, and after 9-6, it quickly increased to 14. Haiqing struggled hard, but was finally won by Xiqing with 15-10, winning the first set first. At the beginning of the second set, Haiqing gradually returned to normal, scoring 6 points in one fell swoop. Before long, Xiqing also scored 4 points in a row, chasing to 4-6. After that, Haiqing relied solely on Zheng Yiquan's outstanding achievements, and was able to exchange two for one each time, so the score was increased to 8-4, 10-5, and even 13-6. Unexpectedly, Xiqing chased again to 9-13, which was quite powerful. After 11-14, the overall situation gradually stabilized. However, Xiqing fought like a trapped beast, adding two more points. Fortunately, Zheng Yiquan smashed successfully, and finally tied the score with 15-11, reversing the danger. In the final deciding game, Haiqing won the first two points. Afterwards, it became two each, three each, and even four each. The progress was very average. After 4-4, Haiqing went all out, and the momentum was like a broken bamboo. When it was 10-4, Xiqing called a timeout to avoid its edge. After reaching 13-4, Xiqing's peak turned around, and it was active again, increasing to 9-13. The two sides fought for the serve for a long time. Finally, Haiqing added one point, making it 14-7. Although Xiqing had surplus strength, after adding another point, it was finally smashed obliquely by Mai Bingyao, losing with 8-15. Haiqing was lucky to reverse the loss with a score of 2-1. However, the situation was shocking, extending the original scheduled time by more than half an hour. From now on, Haiqing only needs to work hard in the second cycle, and there is still great hope for the championship. In another game, the Russian army defeated Suer with a score of 2-0, and the situation was one-sided. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Haiqing: Zheng Yiquan, Mai Bingyao, Bao Entun, Zhang Renming, Yang Zhiqiang, Verodagai.</p>
<p>Xiqing: Borokofev, Guo Naite, Lunbu, Botun, Yinghute, Kloss.</p>
<h3>Huang Bochang Easily Defeats Russian Player Yesterday</h3>
<p>Vigorsky Was No Match At All</p>
<p>Falling Twice in a Row at the End</p>
<p>Our country's professional wrestling expert Huang Bochang fought with Russian Vigorsky in the Night Metropolitan Ballroom last night for a total of six rounds, each lasting ten minutes. Huang knocked him down and pinned him to the ground in the fifth and sixth rounds, declaring victory. This Russian came from Harbin and was the champion there, but his strength was far from Huang's. His strength was not as good, and his skillful skills were also lacking. In the first four rounds, Huang was calm and let him go from time to time, while the Russian was exhausted. In the last two rounds, Huang intensified his offensive and won the victory. It is said that Huang will fight with Indian Haben for the third time soon.</p>
<h3>The Central Youth Sports Department Reorganizes the Swimming Team</h3>
<p>The Central Youth Swimming Team, which holds the authority of Shanghai water sports, did not have any activities throughout the season last year due to special reasons. However, daily exercises were still carried out as usual and were never interrupted. Now, the Seventh National Games will be held in Beijing on the Double Tenth Festival of this year. In order to prepare for participating in the Shanghai Municipal Preliminary Competition and to compete in the General Assembly, the Association has discussed and decided to restore the team. After several discussions, the team was reorganized on the 22nd of last month. All the famous players in the city have been recruited, and they have been stepping up their practice every day. The time is 7:00 pm and 8:00 pm every Monday night, and 8:00 pm to 9:00 pm every Wednesday night. The location is the Central Youth Warm Water Swimming Pool on Sichuan Road.

<h3>Central Youth Women's Basketball Team Fails to Form Due to Insufficient Numbers</h3>
<p>The 7th Central Youth Basketball Games were originally divided into four groups: school, commercial bank, bank, and women. Now the bank group was successfully concluded last week, the commercial bank group has also reached the final stage, and the school group has also begun to compete. However, the women's group has not yet started due to too few registrations. When the women's group started registering, there were originally five teams registered: Qixiu, Black Hawk, Mickey Mouse, Flying Rainbow, and Muir. After the Black Hawk and Muir teams successively requested to withdraw for some reason, only three teams were left. According to the regulations, those with less than four teams cannot be held, so the committee has decided to temporarily suspend the women's group for one year in this competition. Today, because the bank group has ended, there are only four games in the commercial bank group. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Meizui vs. Lingdong (Commercial 4) 5:30 pm, (2) Zhanghua vs. Pingdui (Commercial 3) 6:15 pm, (3) Youdui vs. Nanshui (Commercial 2) 7:00 pm, (4) Hezong vs. Tongren (Commercial 1) 7:45 pm.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Japanese New Cabinet Advocates Sino-Japanese Cultural and Educational Cooperation</h3>
<p>Hayashi's Statement Emphasizes Cultural Contact</p>
<p>University Professors Study Chinese Culture</p>
<p>Students in Japan Under Police Protection</p>
<p>(Tokyo Special Dispatch) Since the establishment of the new Japanese cabinet, there has been extensive discussion on the country's foreign and domestic policies, with a focus on China. The emphasis is on people-to-people contact, with cultural and educational cooperation as the primary objective. Economic cooperation will also adopt a new approach, starting with cultural initiatives and gradually exploring Sino-Japanese economic issues. The Hayashi cabinet has already declared its policy towards China, emphasizing cultural contact to foster goodwill between the two nations. This marks the first public statement from the Japanese authorities regarding Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation. Since the Xi'an Incident, the Japanese education sector has become deeply aware of China's political and economic progress. Pro-China university professors are studying China's progress over the past decade, dividing it into two periods: the first from 1928 to the Manchurian Incident, and the second from the Incident to the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Political Council. They have extensively researched the reasons for the failure of the North China Education and Culture Committee and have meticulously gathered historical materials on student movements in Beiping (Beijing), including detailed information on the committee member lists and organizational outlines of the Beiping Student Union's first, second, third, fourth, and fifth sessions. Detailed investigations have also been conducted on the stances and factions of professors at universities in Beiping, Tianjin, and Shanghai. In Beiping, Chiang Meng-lin and Hu Shih belong to one faction, while Li Shuhua and Li Shengzhang belong to another, and professors who returned from studying in Japan form yet another. The influence of Lu Xun's literature and thought on Chinese youth is also under study. In the political arena, they have collected historical materials on the Tanggu Truce, the East Hebei Autonomous Anti-Communist Council, the Southwest Cooperation, and the Xi'an Incident. In the economic sphere, they have conducted thorough research on currency unification and financial stability after the Xi'an Incident. This reveals the Japanese scholars' deep interest in the trends of Chinese culture, education, politics, and economics. Recently, the conflict between the Student Federation and the Fellow Students Association, both organizations of students studying in Japan, has prompted Japanese professors to gather various materials for research. Since the conflict between the two factions of Chinese students, the Japanese Metropolitan Police Department has been paying close attention to the movements of Chinese students. Currently, students studying in Japan are receiving special protection from the police. It is hoped that Chinese students in Japan will not allow outsiders to mock them for being disunited and will strive for unity like their motherland. Organizing groups is a small matter; national unity is paramount. While abroad, they should maintain contact, study hard, and contribute to their homeland in the future, refraining from infighting to demonstrate the progress of Chinese students to their neighbors. Since the deportation of the staff of the Dongfang News Agency, students studying in Japan at various universities in Tokyo have become keenly aware of the impropriety of overseas activities. Consequently, there has been a change in attitude, with a focus on academic research. Due to the upcoming university examinations (Japan's academic year begins in spring), many Chinese students can be found in libraries. Sun Xihong and Tan Shuqian from the Imperial University, Zhang Yinman from the Commercial University, Zheng Tianlin from Waseda University, and Yao Dihong from Meiji University all have new publications forthcoming.

<h3>Tsinghua University to Build Nanchang Research Institute</h3>
<p>Zhongzheng College to Open Next Semester</p>
<p>(Nanchang Correspondence) Tsinghua University, to facilitate advanced studies for its students, is establishing the Tsinghua Research Institute in Jiangxi Province. The institute is located outside the Liulimen gate in the east gate of the airfield, occupying dozens of acres of land. The Fuxing Company is currently constructing the buildings.

<p>Auxiliary Coin Exchange Rates Are Still Inconsistent</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Can Be Said To Be:</p>
<p>From South to North</p>
<p>From High to Low</p>
<p>South Market Exchange Rate 2970 Cash</p>
<p>Equals 99 One-Cent Coins</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate for Copper Coins, at the End of the Old Lunar Year, Reached a Low of 2820 Cash, (Around Mid-February), Since After the Lantern Festival, the Exchange Rate Has Been Increasing Daily, There Was Also an Incident in the Middle, That is, the Central Bank Entrusted the Business of Exchanging One-Cent Copper Coins to the Tobacco Exchange Industry, But the Exchange Rate for Old Copper Coins, Although There Were Constraints, Still Could Not Make the Exchange Rates Between the Two Equal, Until Recently, There Has Been a Gradual Hope of Equalizing, For Example, in the South Market, the Copper Coin Exchange Rate, Per One Legal Currency Yuan, Can Be Exchanged for 2970 Cash, Which Is Equal to 99 One-Cent Auxiliary Coins, What Is Not Equal, Even Exchanging for 2980 Cash, Which Is Exchanging for 10 More Cash, Is Even More Common,</p>
<p>The Auxiliary Coin Exchange Rate in Shanghai Is Not Uniform, But There Is Also a Similar Pattern, Which Can Be Called "From South to North, From High to Low," Although This Is an Inductive Statement, the General Idea Is Not Very Different, That Is, Taking the Most Recent Copper Coin Exchange Rate, in the French Concession Adjacent to the South Market, the Exchange Rate Is Between 2970 Cash and 2950 Cash, With 2950 Cash Being the Majority, and in the Northern Part of the French Concession Close to the British Concession, It Gradually Approaches the Exchange Rate of the British Concession, Between 2945 Cash, Since Entering the British Concession, the Exchange Rate Is Between 2940 Cash and 2920 Cash, The Lowest Is 2900 Cash, This Is a Very Small Number,</p>
<p>The Exchange Rate for Double Hao, the Highest Is in the South Market Area, One Yuan Can Be Exchanged for 10 Jiao 470-480 Cash, Decreasing From Here, There Are Exchanges for 10 Jiao 450, 440, 430, There Are Also Exchanges for 10 Jiao 420 Cash, Which Is Also a Very Small Number,</p>
<p>As For the Exchange Rate From Double Hao to Copper Coins, From 480 Cash to 450 Cash, One Store Can Actually Exchange for 500 Cash, This Is Also Difficult to Encounter,</p>
<p>Sterling Settlement is Strong</p>

<h3>Compilation Method of Income Tax Return Forms (1)</h3>
<p>— Pan Shihao</p>
<p>In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the government planned to implement income tax, and the Shanghai Banking Association's Banking Weekly published a special issue on income tax issues to advocate it. At that time, I happened to be involved in the editing of the Banking Weekly, and I also wrote an article from the standpoint of regulating the social economy to show my promotion. It has been fifteen or sixteen years now. Later, I tried to implement it many times, but failed many times, until recently, it was implemented by the National Government. Promoting good taxes to regulate the social economy and alleviate the difficulties of national finance is indeed a gratifying thing. However, the calculation of income tax and the procedures for filing returns are very complicated. Any inadequacy will be hindered. Recently, industry and commerce have failed to file various return forms on time because they do not understand the filing procedures. Therefore, based on my personal understanding, I will explain the compilation and filing methods of various return forms, so as to alleviate the difficulties of industry and commerce and contribute to the promotion of income tax. However, it is only done during leisure time, in bits and pieces, and omissions are unavoidable. If readers correct me, it is especially hoped.</p>
<p>(1) Business Report Form</p>
<p>According to Article 46 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Regulations, companies, commercial firms, banks, factories, and profit-making individuals shall, within one month from the date of implementation of these Detailed Rules, report their names, addresses, businesses, capital or paid-in capital amounts to the local competent collection agency. The business report form is the form used by commercial firms, banks, factories, and profit-making individuals that are not company organizations to report the above-mentioned matters. Those banks, factories, etc. that belong to the company organization shall use the company report form to report. The matters that should be filled in in this book are explained as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Name: All commercial firms, banks, factories, and profit-making individuals must have a certain name. For example, Huaxin Woodware Shop, Jingtaide Rice Shop, Continental Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yu Da Xieji Shop, etc. The "Name" and "Business" positions in the form should be completely filled in based on the facts. Those who have registered as a commercial firm and those who have filled in the name of the commercial firm in the trademark license. The name filled in in this form should be the same as it. Although this form is called the Business Report Form, according to the provisions of Article 46 of the Implementing Rules, its scope of application is not limited to "Banks" and "Shops", but also applies to "Warehouses", "Factories" and other categories.</p>
<p>(2) Name of Responsible Person: The responsible person is the person who is responsible for paying income tax. In principle, it should be the manager, factory director, and owner of the business. The position and name should be clearly stated when filling in. According to Article 27 of the Implementing Rules, the method of paying income tax, which belongs to Category A and Category B income of the first category of profit-making business income (that is, continued profit-making income), is paid by the business responsible person himself. For those belonging to Category C income of the first category and salary remuneration income of the second category, and securities deposit income of the third category, the principle is that the business responsible person of the payment agency shall withhold and pay on his behalf. Only those without payment agencies or owners of the first category of Category C income and the second category of income shall pay by the taxpayer or his agent. The responsible person filled in in this form should have the same nature as this kind of business responsible person. Although Article 46 of the Implementing Rules does not clearly stipulate that the name of the responsible person must be declared. However, the bank should have a certain responsible person, and it is reasonable to list this as a matter that should be declared in this form. (Unfinished)</p>

<h3>Environment</h3>
<p>— (Drunken Woodcutter)</p>
<p>The environment is like the outer iron shell of a bomb, and people are the gunpowder hidden inside. If this bomb is not pushed, and it is quietly left there, then the highly explosive gunpowder cannot develop its special characteristics, which is like a person living in a comfortable environment, and he is unwilling to do anything, and at the same time he has failed in the great responsibility that life has in society: so we need a harsh environment to shake us, so that our spirit of struggle can explode with magnificent sparks, and fulfill our duty as human beings!</p>
<p>However, many young people hate the harsh environment; at the same time, they also misunderstand the purpose of struggling against the harsh environment, so they go in the opposite direction, they shout: "We want to jump out of the bad environment and find our new path!" That's like those who don't know how to use bombs, and blow themselves up instead! In fact, the new path should be reached by fighting in a harsh environment, not fearing hardship, and working hard to move forward!</p>
<p>For example, if we want to go to a certain place, but we must pass through a desert area, if we feel that the desert area is not good for walking, then the destination will never be reached! If we want to get there, we have to run through this section of the desert; if we say we want to take a detour, first, we will waste time, and second, we will inevitably go astray, and it will be too late to regret!</p>
<p>Here we have an important theory of being human: that is, "seeking oneself" and "believing in oneself", seeking oneself, only oneself is the most reliable helper: believing in oneself, will not be deceived or tempted by anyone, then we can also run quickly on the road to success!</p>
<h3>Thoughts on the Friends' Festival</h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Today, the third day of the third month, is the Friends' Festival. I have never heard of the term "Friends' Festival" before. Who knew that its creation has already been four years in the making?</p>
<p>The initiator is none other than Mr. Huang Jingwan, the owner of Wanyou Yuan and a social scientist. No one but him would do such a thing.</p>
<p>What's the reason?</p>
<p>Because who else besides him is worthy of being called the owner of Wanyou Yuan?</p>
<p>I heard him say to me:</p>
<p>"My whole life has depended on my friends to help me, and I also eat the food provided by my friends. If I didn't have friends, I wouldn't have food to eat! I really can't count how many friends I have now! Probably no less than two hundred thousand people."</p>
<p>After hearing his words, we felt that he was indeed correct. However, among the friends we make, we can't find a single good one, and in the end, we always suffer losses ourselves. I myself have been badly deceived by friends! It is evident that the most difficult thing to find in society is a true friend.</p>
<p>According to this, should we not make friends? No, how can a person not have friends? We see that in Mr. Wan's book "Social Etiquette", there is also a section saying that he himself has encountered a bad friend.</p>
<p>Friends are indeed indispensable today, but we should always treat friends with "respect" and "love." People are not plants or trees; we can always get help from friends! We only need to follow the saying of the sage: "When walking with two others, one of them will surely be able to teach me something." Just do that.</p>
<p>Therefore, the creation of the Friends' Festival is what we need most. It is not only to increase mutual friendship but also to restore our inherent Chinese morality.</p>
<h3>"Almost"</h3>
<p>— Jiao Shijie</p>
<p>In fact, no matter what a person does, there must be certainty. One is one, and two is two. Don't ever say "how many people are there?" "Almost seven or eight." This kind of "almost" answer is an uncertain answer. Allow me to tell you two facts for your consideration.</p>
<p>A man named Huang is an accountant in a certain firm. He particularly likes to say "almost." One night, the manager came and asked Mr. Huang: "How is the account today? How much money is there?" Mr. Huang replied, "Almost, the money in the account is almost." The manager asked him again, "Is it more? Is it less? Or is it just right?" He still kept saying "almost." Later, the manager himself said, "I just took a ride in a rickshaw, and because I didn't have any money with me, I borrowed two dimes from the account. It's still in the account now." Then Mr. Huang said, "That's more like it!"</p>
<p>There is also a Mr. Li who mispronounces words and is a believer in Buddhism, often chanting scriptures and eating vegetarian food. Once, he said to people, "For these three days, I will be 'Qí jiè mù yù' again." Everyone listened to him, not understanding, thinking he was talking about some profound Buddhist philosophy. Later, he wrote the characters out, and it turned out to be "Zhāi jiè mù yù". This made everyone burst into laughter. He blushed, and everyone asked him again, "Are 'zhāi' and 'qí' the same?" He said, "Isn't that 'almost' the same? What's so funny!"</p>
<p>After reading the two stories above, everyone can understand that those who cannot be certain and those who knowingly refuse to admit their mistakes will never gain people's trust. Although they always use the word "almost" to shirk responsibility, sometimes there is no way to avoid saying "almost." Please see the following anecdote:</p>
<p>Zhang, Wang, Li, and Guo happened to be together, and they all had the same fondness for playing mahjong. So, they immediately started a game of mahjong. It was made clear beforehand that if you called "win" incorrectly, you would have to pay. After a few rounds, Mr. Zhang, with both "pong" and "chow," waited to "win" with two pairs of "sixes of bamboo" and "nines of dots". Mr. Wang played a "nine of bamboo," and Mr. Zhang called "win" across the river. Upon inspection, it was actually a "six of bamboo," so of course, he called "win" incorrectly. So everyone wanted Mr. Zhang to pay. Mr. Zhang said, "Don't 'six of bamboo' and 'nine of bamboo' look 'almost' the same? You can't count that as me calling 'win' incorrectly." But the other three did not let it go just because it was "almost" the same. As a result, Mr. Zhang had to pay up.</p>
<p>From this, we can know that even if you are cunning and say "almost," sometimes you cannot shirk responsibility. Therefore, no matter what you do, you should never have an "almost" mentality and must take responsibility for everything you do and speak with certainty.</p>

<p>Lan sat upright and said to the Second Young Mistress in a serious tone: "Second Sister-in-law, are these words you said today what Mother asked you to inform me of? Or did you reveal them unintentionally?" The Second Young Mistress showed a look of surprise on her face and shook her hands at the same time, saying: "My sister, let's just say this. Not only did Mother not ask me to tell you, but she also told us not to spread this matter to your ears. There is no other intention. It's just that I'm afraid you'll worry for no reason when you hear it. You don't know, if you have any worried look, Mother will inevitably inquire about it everywhere, asking what it's for. She knows that you won't be happy to hear about this matter, and there are still some days left, would she be willing to tell you so early? Sister, you are an intelligent person, what do you not know? You probably read more books than we know characters. We don't have the guts to play tricks in front of you. Good sister, let's just say this and end it here, no need to mention it again." As she spoke, she stood up, showing that she was sincerely afraid and dared not take responsibility. Menglan leaned against the edge of the table, bit her lip slightly, looked at the tips of her shoes, crossed her fingers, put them in her arms, and was lost in thought. The Second Young Mistress said: "Sister, what's wrong with you? I only advised you not to worry, but you still want to worry." Menglan took a breath and said: "No matter who is in my situation, they can't help but worry, right?" The Second Young Mistress stomped her feet lightly on the floor and said: "Oh! That's my words were wrong." Menglan waved her hand and said: "No, I understand it a long time ago. It's like the prisoners in the death row, although they don't know which day they will go to the execution ground, they know very well in their hearts that the end is not far away." The Second Young Mistress blushed when she heard her say such serious words. Menglan said: "Second Sister-in-law, do you think my words are too harsh? I think these are the words that need to be said from the bottom of my heart. Just tell me, which day is it?" The Second Young Mistress smiled bitterly and said: "If I tell you, you'll be forcing me." Menglan poured a cup of tea, held it to her mouth with her right hand, supported the elbow of her right arm with her left hand, took a sip of tea, looked up at the ceiling, finished drinking the tea, and then nodded twice. The Second Young Mistress smiled and said: "Second Sister, do you also think that what I'm worried about is correct?" (140)</p>
<p>Personal Sketches</p>
<h3>Master Hong Ji</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chengxi</p>
<p>I heard that Mr. Cha Mengji became a monk four years ago, with the Dharma name Master Hong Ji. Even though he is still a professor of Chinese Studies at the Law School and Jianguo Middle School.</p>
<p>I have been separated from him for many years. This time, I went to visit him incidentally.</p>
<p>The room was filled with the fragrance of sandalwood. Incense smoke swirled in front of the Buddha statue. The master was silently compiling the Chinese Studies lecture notes for the Law School.</p>
<p>"Teacher Cha, do you still recognize me?" He scrutinized me carefully for a while and actually said, "Zhu Chengxi, right? I remember!"</p>
<p>After sitting idly for a while, I wanted to discuss with him the reason for becoming a monk. I raised many questions, but he always just smiled and did not answer! He got up to add incense and tapped the chime stone "ding" once.</p>
<p>"Let's talk about your life!" He began to ask about my life. I answered him haphazardly, but never talked about "becoming a monk" or "Buddha." Perhaps ordinary people are not worthy of talking about Buddha!</p>
<p>I began to browse the room, which served as a Buddhist hall, an office, and a bedroom. On the wall hung many paintings of Buddhas and couplets. In the middle was a couplet written by the master himself: "Returning to the origin, there is no second path; there are many doors for convenience." A Buddha statue was enshrined on the table by the window, with incense burning, and Buddhist instruments such as wooden fish and chime stone were placed there. The "Lankavatara Sutra" and other scriptures were stacked there. There was also a futon on the ground, which was said to be where the master meditated and did his morning and evening prayers.</p>
<p>In another corner hung a portrait of his beloved mother, with a red paper attached to the side with the eight characters "Honored guests arrive, please decline bowing". There were also the words "Wash the face with water, may all beings attain the pure Dharma door and be forever free from defilement" at the washing place.</p>
<p>As I was examining everything, Mr. Yuan Yeyu suddenly walked in with a stack of books. He was also my former teacher and was very concerned, asking about my well-being. At that time, the master suddenly pointed to a large cake on the table and said to Mr. Yuan, "This cake has been left there since the summer vacation. Look, it's not moldy or spoiled." Mr. Yuan said, "Oh! It's been almost three or four months. This is the miracle of believing in Buddha! Otherwise, the mice would have eaten it!" After a while, the master said again, "I want to keep it there permanently and see what it becomes like after three years!" Then, the three of them smiled knowingly!</p>
<p>Before leaving, I troubled the master to write a few words. He casually wrote with a pen, "Without all suffering, but receiving all joy, in this world, all transcendent Dharma."</p>
<p>When I got home, I flipped through "Gratitude and Becoming a Monk" and "Blocking the Meat-Eating Dharma Door," which Master Hong Ji had given me, and I really couldn't figure out why Teacher Cha became a monk. I remember that before January 28th, when our alma mater, Jianguo Middle School, was still in Shen Lianfang's "Zhiyuan," Teacher Cha had two things that attracted the attention of the students. One was his broad knowledge. He understood Japanese, English, and French and was also an Esperantist. The tables, shelves, and beds in his room, even the floor, were piled with books of various languages and natures. The other was that he was very close to the female students. I remember once in a Chinese class, he recited aloud the poem of the female student Zhou Gengxuan: "Carrying a gun, bearing a sword, rushing through the battle line, the one I miss! Dangerous, dangerous!" Master Cha probably still doesn't have any impression, does he?</p>
<p>However, he eventually became a monk. His Dharma name is Master Hong Ji.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Gathering of Stars in Suzhou</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The Xing Society held three elegant gatherings last year, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, Double Ninth Festival, and Lunar New Year's Eve, all in Shanghai. Very few members from Suzhou attended the chrysanthemum viewing at Jinghao Tower. When the Suzhou Library held the Wuzhong Cultural Relics Exhibition this time, because the director, Jiang Yinqiu, was also a member of the society, he discussed it with Mr. Fan Yanqiao, the executive officer, and it was decided to hold it in Suzhou on February 21st. That day was a Sunday, so the Shanghai members could take time off, killing two birds with one stone, and everyone agreed. I went the day before, and the next day, when I visited the Wuzhong Cultural Relics Exhibition with my wife Wu Songru and four children, I met the editor of this journal, Mr. Shoujuan, and Director Jiang. According to them, although it was raining, Tao Lengyue, Zheng Yimei, Xu Bibo, Jiang Hongjiao, Zhao Yanyun, and other gentlemen from Shanghai still came, and Yi Junzuo and Jun from Zhenjiang also rushed to the scene. The banquet was set at the Facing-Water Pavilion of Canglang Pavilion across the street, and Mr. Fan Yanqiao was already hosting. So we went there immediately. Soon, Fan Peiyu, Zhou Kerang, Fan Junbo, Cheng Zhanlu, Fan Jugao, Xu Yunqiu, Willow Junran, Wu Daiqiu, Chen Jia, Gu Moqi, Fan Shaoyun, Zhao Ziyun, and other gentlemen arrived one after another. Some had not seen each other for a long time, and some had only admired each other from afar. Gathering together, they were extremely happy. Yanqiao brought out a small booklet and asked everyone to write a poem to leave a trace of their presence. When Junzuo was writing a poem, Lengyue happened to be beside him. So, in addition to describing the scenery, he also embedded the four characters "Yanqiao Lengyue" into the seven-character quatrain. His talent was quick and agile. If he weren't an expert, how could he have achieved this? When taking photos in front of the Academy of Fine Arts, Gu Mingdao suffered from foot problems and sat alone. Jiang Yinqiu was late due to busy affairs. Everyone compared Gu to Zhang Jingjiang and called Jiang Chairman Jiang. I said: "The architecture of the Academy of Fine Arts is magnificent and comparable to the Central Party Headquarters. Those who don't know will definitely suspect that the people in the photo are important figures in the party-state. The 28th is the number of constellations. Our society is named after stars. The number of people attending today is exactly 28. It can be called a natural match." Everyone laughed loudly. After taking their seats, Yanqiao first asked everyone to stand up one by one and introduce themselves so that everyone could recognize their faces. Then, because Bibo, Yinqiu, Hongjiao, and Junzuo were all 40 years old this year, he asked everyone to stand up and raise a glass together to express their congratulations. I said that today's meeting was quite difficult to achieve. Please add more prints of the photos that have been taken. Yanqiao will fill in everyone's names in order according to their standing positions. Then, those gentlemen who have never met will know who they are when they see the photo and don't need to ask their names again. And we should imitate Wang Xizhi's Orchid Pavilion gathering and elect someone to write a preface to leave a memorial. Shoujuan will draw another picture, and the result is that Junzuo is publicly elected to write the preface, and the painters present each draw a picture, which is mounted into a hand scroll and personally inscribed by everyone, which will be treasured in the Suzhou Provincial Library. I said: "Then, when the Wuzhong Cultural Relics Exhibition is held again in 300 years, this scroll should also be regarded as a treasure for future generations to appreciate." Later, Junzuo distributed the various lyrics and bimonthly publications he wrote about promoting the nation. Yanqiao asked him to sing impromptu. He said that he could only write lyrics but was not good at singing, and a blind friend who was good at music did not come with him this time. It was not until after three o'clock that everyone dispersed happily.</p>

<p>Supplement to the Shanghai Shen Bao</p>
<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>All Men in the World Are Confused</h3>
<p>— I</p>
<p>The previous newspaper reported: Zhang Xueliang and his wife, accompanied by Deng Shiping and others, passed through Ningbo at 10:00 AM on the 26th to visit scenic spots such as Tiantong and Yuwang. They returned to Xikou at 6:00 PM in the evening. It is true that being without official duties brings lightness. One can imagine the pleasure of the virtuous couple enjoying the springs, stones, mountains, and forests, which is very enviable.</p>
<p>I remember when Ms. Yu Fengzhi returned to China the other day, she said to people: "All men in the world are confused. If there are no women to restrain them, they will cause trouble." It can be seen that Ms. Yu Fengzhi's trip with Zhang Xueliang to enjoy the mountains and waters and cultivate their virtues has its own reasons. Isn't this a means for Ms. Yu Fengzhi to restrain her husband?</p>
<p>It is said: "A family with a virtuous wife will not suffer misfortune." This kind of talk was once fashionable in the era of autocracy, which is why virtuous mothers and good wives are so popular. If this saying is brought up again now, I am afraid that the men of the world will inevitably raise a protest, thinking that it is an insult to men. Because the power of the husband is higher than everything else, this is why the women's rights movement is so loudly advocated.</p>
<p>But if I carefully observe the situation in society, the statement that the power of the husband is higher than everything else is nonsense. If the men of the world hear it, they may feel flattered. I see that the men in the world who are afraid of their wives are all good and obedient people. Only those who are not afraid of their wives are truly out of control. Conversely, if one is unfortunate enough to marry an unvirtuous woman, then the family will have many troubles from then on. Therefore, there are filial sons because there are filial daughters-in-law. This saying is true and cannot be falsely accused.</p>
<p>However, Ms. Yu said that all men in the world are confused. This word "all" is inevitably too dogmatic, as if all men in the world are as confused as Zhang Xueliang. Conversely, if all men in the world are confused, does it mean that all women in the world are not confused? This statement inevitably has the suspicion of insulting men. Are all the good men in the world the result of their wives' discipline? Do the men who like to cause trouble all cause trouble because their wives do not strictly discipline them, or because the men are stubborn and do not accept discipline? I am afraid it is not necessarily so.</p>
<p>But I cannot say that Ms. Yu's words are absolutely credible, but they are also partially credible, because there are too many husbands who are afraid of their wives in the world now, and there are really many who are willing to accept the strict control of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Even among my friends, those who harbor the fear of Ji Chang are at least half or more. Therefore, those who are now shouting loudly for the women's rights movement often say that women are men's slaves and men's playthings, as if the women of the world are always under the eighteenth level of hell. Alas! What is this? What is this?</p>
<p>Therefore, I say that if the power of the husband is ultimately higher than everything else, then the power of the wife must be higher than everything else. Why? Because all men in the world are confused.</p>
<h3>"Planned Hunger"</h3>
<p>— Yingchun</p>
<p>According to a report by the Berlin correspondent of the Reuter's News Agency: According to official statistics, the number of unemployed people in Germany in January reached 1,853,000, of which 700,000 are currently unable to receive any assistance and are bound to suffer from hunger and poverty. Reports from various sources indicate that the amount of food reserves in 1936 has been drastically reduced by two to three times. The recently concluded Berlin Agricultural Exhibition clearly demonstrated the increasingly severe food shortage in fascist Germany. The exhibition was held under the slogan of opposing excessive food quotas. The brochure stated: "On average, Germans eat more fat than necessary. Fat consumption can be reduced by 25%. The same is true for meat consumption. The struggle against excessive food quotas should save about one million marks." As a result of planned hunger, the birth rate has plummeted, and the mortality rate has increased. At the same time, the physical condition of young people drafted into the army is extremely unhealthy. According to the report of the conscription inspection committee, only 75% of the conscripted soldiers last year could be classified as first-class and second-class, 13.6% were physically weak, 9% suffered from indigestion, and 8.9% suffered from heart disease.</p>
<p>In recent years, as a result of Germany's expansion of armaments, the country has repeatedly experienced food and butter panics. Hitler, Goering, Schacht, and others have repeatedly stated: "It is better to save butter and bread to endure hunger than to be without cannons and warships." But how can they satisfy the desires of the German people?</p>
<p>Let's not discuss whether "700,000 people" out of the "1,853,000 people" have starved to death because they could not "get any assistance," or whether there are even more people "waiting to die." But the results of "opposing excessive food quotas" and "planned hunger" have clearly created the phenomenon that "the birth rate has plummeted, and the mortality rate has increased." This, in Hitler's "rewarding childbirth" plan, cannot but be said to be "vastly different"! And what is especially noteworthy is that the "physical condition of the youth" "drafted into the army" is "extremely unhealthy." The total number of people suffering from heart disease, indigestion, and physical weakness actually accounts for 25%, which cannot but be said to be a rather alarming number. Moreover, if this continues, it goes without saying that it will continue to increase. With so many "sick men" in the army, even if airplanes, warships, cannons... etc., are so sharp, how can they defeat all the enemies of the "Third Reich", let alone the dream of completely ruling the world? ...Indeed, this cannot but be said to be a terrible crisis!</p>
<p>Just when Mr. Hitler is planning to covet the Soviet Union and interfere in the internal affairs of Spain, when he is so excited, I am afraid that even he himself has not foreseen what kind of results this "crisis" will lead to, right? So, we mention it here. I don't know if it's "borrowing people's worries"? In fact, there are similar countries in our neighborhood!</p>
<h3>Eyes</h3>
<p>— Luo Yu</p>
<p>The struggle of mankind is unfolding in a huge machine. There will be a time when people will feel tired and pray for a window to the soul, right?</p>
<p>After July 193x, I was in such a miserable situation. My stubbornness about a dream had not yet been shattered. In life, all my abilities were probably only consumed by a few percent. It was just like a cow's slow rumination after exhaustion. But on the other hand, I also felt the darkness of my soul.</p>
<p>One afternoon, in that small courtyard, I unexpectedly encountered a pair of eyes. They flashed like weak sparks, and they immediately opened the praying window in my heart. Through that window, I discovered new fields and new skies.</p>
<p>Naturally, it is not easy to stay away from those eyes. So, I moved into that small courtyard. That passionate window kept opening for me, lingering for three to five minutes, allowing me to breathe in the new fields as much as possible and wander in the bright shrub garden. In this way, my days were colored and vibrated with rhythm.</p>
<p>In happiness, I began to gaze at the woman in a black dress standing in the middle of the little girls. When I stood in my door and lingered on the glass grid for a while, those bright eyes slowly lifted up, not allowing any other life to observe, almost as if for my tyranny.</p>
<p>With a tremor, I moved those eyes away, and a black shadow stood in my heart. That woman had curved hair that sometimes hung on her forehead, as if she couldn't overcome fatigue. But every turn of her slender shoulders showed her fullness of vitality. Her thin lips appeared pale, like the paleness of a professional woman. Sometimes she would apply some rouge, but it revealed two pitiful reds. These would make people abandon her, but only those eyes defended her.</p>
<p>In those days, I kept thinking: Is our noblest virtue equal to the brilliance revealed in those eyes, the extremely painful and extremely happy brilliance?</p>
<p>On every page of my diary, I wrote: Those eyes are perhaps the only door to heaven and tomorrow, the only sheath that protects beauty and bravery.</p>
<p>Two months passed. I had not said a word to her. One day, I took a two-hour train to see my mother. I told her about that woman without concealing or exaggerating, quite thinking that she could sympathize with my thoughts. But she said words that made me extremely sad.</p>
<p>That woman was from the same hometown. She grew up on the bend of the river in her hometown. Her mother was a woman who fell into the abyss of the underworld and stained the good neighbors. Her father was a mediocre man carrying a pen like dead ashes. Her brother slowly turned into a rebellious child because he didn't have tuition fees. Her one younger brother was sold by her mother. And she herself was betrothed by her mother to an opium merchant.</p>
<p>"That girl will die of sorrow. People say that she is getting thinner day by day, and that poor girl will suffocate to death"!</p>
<p>I argued against all that ugliness. I said that I wanted to make her live. I hoped that my mother could finally sympathize with me. But she cried, like when I was a child. She said:</p>
<p>"Give up that thought! For the sake of your reputation, for the sake of the slander your father suffered, and even more for the violence he inflicted on your mother. If there were no such unreasonable thoughts, you would all be kind and praised. That principal knows your father and has also praised you. If you remember these things, then turn back"!</p>
<p>I listened to my mother. I endured it.</p>
<p>When I took the train south again one afternoon, I saw those silent eyes hanging on my neck like two arms.</p>
<p>Like millions of bright eyes, let them burst into flames or dry up and die! I want to stay away. I want to leave this city. This is my strategy!</p>
<h3>More</h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>Fatigue, like countless insects, crept gradually from the soles of my feet. My body, wrapped in a cotton quilt, curled up in bed, without a trace of sleepiness. Night dreams are always not worth mentioning, right? Trains derailed for no reason into deep ravines. And the unparalleled warriors also sighed deeply because of some meaningless trivial matters.</p>
<p>Wearing pajamas, I stood in front of the stove and stirred up the dying flames. At the window, I used my fingers to wipe away a layer of moisture covering the glass, peering out at the night through the gaps between the finger marks. The wind drove the dots and lines of snow against the window.</p>
<p>The sound of the night watchman's gong was cold. The night was vast and silent. An occasional howling wind rose from afar and disappeared into the distance. The sound of the gong fell into the sea of night, like a stone thrown into a dark puddle, densely spreading out terrifying sound waves like the night itself. The sound of the clapper coming from the distant corner of the house repeated itself in my eardrums.</p>
<p>The sound of the clapper gradually approached, resounding through the dark night. The night watchman, the sound of the gong, and a dim red paper lantern swept past together, from the dark, misty dew to the dark, misty dew, like a ghost. Through the gaps between the finger marks, I saw a black and emaciated figure, wearing a tattered black felt hat. It must be a frail old man. The old man's withered hand carried a lazy, tired, red lantern, unable to illuminate the dense black fog around him. Roadside obstacles lurking with crushing stones, tree roots, and ditches, awaited his carelessness in his thousands of checks.</p>
<p>Passing through the vast silence, the monotonous sound of the clapper sparsely measured the bottomless third watch of the night. The wind drove the dots and lines of snow against the window.</p>

<h3>Moonlit Scene at Hengtang</h3>
<p>— Liu Wang</p>
<p>I love the old stone bridge of that ancient building, although compared to the concrete bridge seven or eight zhang away on the same river, it appears too old and too shabby. However, precisely because of this, it suits my eccentric temperament, and I love it.</p>
<p>Every dusk, our group of people who rely on our brains, mouths, and hands to earn a living, would invariably walk towards the stone bridge as soon as we put down our bowls and chopsticks. No one needs to propose it, and no one would deny it. It was as if we were doing a fixed homework, slowly walking in the same direction. It's like this today, like this tomorrow, like this every day, unless the rain occupies the muddy road making it wet and slippery, then everyone would not go to the bridge, and would have to sulk inside. But at this time, sighs would rise one after another.</p>
<p>Behind our office, there is a wide highway, planted with many maple poplars and white poplars on both sides. They are long-lived, lush, and tall. Those heart-shaped leaves rustle in the breeze. We listen to this desolate and solemn sound, walking silently. Only the coal dust on the ground makes a faint "swishing" sound as our shoes brush past, echoing the low sighs of the maple and poplar leaves.</p>
<p>After walking less than a hundred paces on the highway, we are blocked by a river that is not too narrow. The concrete bridge connects to the highway; but the small stone bridge, which is seventy or eighty zhang away, is familiar to the country people and is also loved by us. Every day, we cross the concrete bridge without any reluctance, without stopping, and then take a bend and step onto the stone bridge.</p>
<p>This stone bridge is truly too old. Although we have no way to investigate the year it was built, from its weather-beaten appearance, we cannot help but admit that it was built more than a hundred years ago. On both sides of the stone bridge, the stone railings are already shaking. We sit on them with excessive caution, while more timid friends prefer to sit on the stone steps.</p>
<p>The bridge opening is semicircular, and the arc reflected on the water has caused me to stare at it and spend many nights. Above the circular bridge opening, there is a rectangular yellow stone engraved with the three characters "Hengtang Bridge," without any inscription above or below. Perhaps it was not the negligence of the ancestors, but probably the long years, worn away by wind and rain. At one end of the bridge, there is a kiosk, which was originally intended as a resting place for travelers; but now, it is filled with horse dung, cow dung, and ashes of firewood, and people can no longer walk into it. The selfish behavior of people is fully manifested in this.</p>
<p>On moonlit nights, our enthusiasm is even higher. Some play the harmonica, some sing songs, some recite poetry. It is truly elegant, as if we are all remnants of the Middle Ages, forgetting the strife of the real society. But, I must say that this kind of enthusiasm is excusable, because our group of men and women spend a full ten hours a day using our brains, mouths, hands, and other things on the education of the next generation. It cannot be said that we are not working hard. Isn't this little bit of entertainment very proper?</p>
<p>The moonlight shines on the stone bridge and also on the bodies of our group of men and women. The shadow of the bridge is reflected on the water, and the shadows of the people are reflected on the bridge. And the ancient willow tree beside the bridge also covers us with its figure. On the river, from time to time, there is a sound of "plop, plop," which is faint but very crisp. That is the scene of small fish seeing the moon and being happy, floating on the surface of the water to play. Further away, there are one or two dim red fishing lights, slowly moving and flickering, setting off the gray-black sky behind them, like twinkling stars.</p>
<p>The moon hides in the long strands of the willow tree. One of the older members of our group, who had spent a lot of effort in classical literature, excitedly recited a poem:</p>
<p>"Where does the homesickness arise, the moon over Hengtang at the seventh hour..."</p>
<p>Everyone was struck by his melodious tone and sad mood. We were silent until the distant fishing lights went out.</p>

<p>Opening - "New Baoyu Visits the Sick"</p>
<p>Young master Yihong and Pinqing, two little ones without suspicion, each with affection. Unexpectedly, the God of Heaven is jealous of beauty, so the beautiful woman is sick and trapped in a city of sorrow. Her delicate body lies in Xiaoxiang Pavilion, and the little maid often brews medicine and tea. Sighing that there are few confidants, her heart is filled with emotion and tears fill her eyes. Suddenly, the parrot cries repeatedly, saying that a guest is knocking on the door, calling for the maid Juan. Hastily ordered the maid to go outside the room and ask who has come and wants to hear clearly. The maid obeyed the order and opened the door, seeing that it was Baoyu who had come, and emotions arose. Because it was rare for him to come at night, it showed that he was naturally amorous and righteous. She hurriedly took the lantern and led him into the door with light steps. She went to the bedside to report, saying that Second Master Bao was walking alone tonight, coming in person to visit the sick, and the servant's sincerity represents the master's welcome. He has arrived at the bedside to see you, and you can ask him to judge what grievances you have. Daiyu listened, filled with mixed feelings, as if seeing the sun after a long rain. She had thousands of words to say, but struggled to softly call out "Cousin". She said that Second Sister-in-law was too deceitful, and she was so melancholic and sick that she was about to sacrifice her life. Although the Old Ancestor treats me kindly, it is difficult for me to voice my grievances when I am sick. Don't expect me to recover without medicine, I fear that we will only meet again in the next life to form an alliance on the mountain. Baoyu listened, his heart startled, and he advised her not to fight with the Wang family, to take care of her body and seek to be well, to put aside all matters, and to hope for good fortune. After giving this advice, he bid farewell, unable to do anything about the injustice. He could only sing a few lines as the opening.</p>

<h3>Discussion on Reducing Automobile Weight</h3>
<p>— Shuo</p>
<p>Analysis of the weight of each part of the car How can the weight be reduced?</p>
<p>The weight of an automobile has a great relationship with both manufacturing and driving. During manufacturing, metal joints, screws, and other such things are essential. Other things like car doors, dashboards, and seats inevitably use heavy and large materials. The cost of materials and manual production will be high. As for driving, the lighter the body weight, the less engine power is required. The consumption of fuel and oil will naturally be economical. Regarding taxation and lighting, these can also decrease as the weight of the car decreases. Regarding the possibility of reducing automobile weight, Mr. Griggs, a body engineer at Hudson Motor Car Company in the United States, elaborated in great detail in a paper he read at a meeting held by the Detroit branch of the Society of Automotive Engineers. Now, a few important points are selected for reference.</p>
<p>The heaviest thing on a car is undoubtedly the body itself. However, the accumulation of smaller parts in other areas also has a significant impact on the weight of the entire car. For example, the glass used for car windows, car doors, and windshields adds up to several tens of pounds. If composite glass is used instead, the weight can be reduced. If some metal sheet parts of the car body can be eliminated and some wire mesh parts can be improved, and if lighter materials are used for car doors and seats, the weight of the entire car can be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>The total weight of a car that we commonly see is roughly three thousand pounds. Most of this weight is on the chassis. The weight of the body is usually nine hundred pounds. In the chassis, three hundred pounds of weight belongs to the frame. In the body, three hundred pounds is the structural weight of the shell, not including the weight of all the doors. In this way, the structural part of the entire body has a weight of six hundred pounds. When calculating the weight of the car body, those that do not belong to the structural part include two hundred and fifty-five pounds for the doors, one hundred and seventy-five pounds for the seats, and fifty-five pounds for the glass. Other decorations and accessories, such as carpets, covers, cardboard, insulation materials, and ironware, weigh a total of one hundred and seventy pounds.</p>
<p>Currently, the weight of metal sheets on the car body (these are the metal sheets that cover the car body) is two hundred pounds. Even if most of them are joined by welding, all the bolts, screws, hinges, etc., still add up to thirty-five pounds. The metal sheets used for parts like the engine hood, radiator, and mudguards do not have a structural bearing relationship, but they are used to cover unsightly machine parts to achieve smoothness and beauty. Their weight totals one hundred and eighty-one pounds.</p>
<p>Now the unibody cars that are already in use, and the improved gains from using light-weight metals to generate sufficient strength, the weight problem when making cars will reach a stage of major change. Regarding the complete application of light-weight metal sheets, the automobile industry has not done as much precise research as the aviation industry. The materials currently used in car manufacturing, especially metal sheets, etc., must use materials of considerable thickness. This is because the surface layer bears a heavy load in supporting it. However, some places are already adopting partial welding. Thicker materials are only used where they are related to the structure. In this way, good results can be seen in terms of weight reduction.</p>
<p>Since the invention of scientific welding, the best results have been achieved in reducing weight. Because all the materials do not need to be overlapped when connected, all the nails and screws are also eliminated. Because by utilizing the welding method, entire car roofs and rear wall panels will not generate additional weight. Chemists also make significant contributions to weight reduction, such as introducing zinc, aluminum, and all synthetic resins for practical application. In actual manufacturing, if one pound of weight can be reduced, then one pound of manufacturing cost can be reduced.</p>
<p>The automobile in 1900 was very rudimentary in manufacturing. It was simply a motor placed on a four-wheeled carriage. During the period from 1910 to 1920, the manufacturing method gradually changed. Every part of the car was planned by experts. Each part was different. After this trend started, the increase in weight could not be avoided. As a result, several companies could not continue to operate because they could not solve this problem. Only a few companies that did not avoid difficulties achieved great success through active improvement. From that time on, the automobile manufacturing industry knew about using metal sheets and major issues such as weight reduction.</p>
<p>In 1937, car manufacturing returned to the situation in 1900. That is, the entire car is a whole. All engine parts, axles, and other parts are assembled into a complete car. At the same time, the influence of style planners is also increasing day by day. When the style of the car changes in each period, the structure must conform to the changed style. Because of the style planners, the structure often cannot be excessively changed.</p>
<h3>Advertising Screen in the Car</h3>
<p>— Y</p>
<p>Advertising in public buses is something we often see. However, the position of that type of advertisement cannot be very large. As a result, it is inevitably less effective in attracting the attention of readers. Moreover, the space in some cars is very tight, making it difficult to place advertisements. An advertiser in San Diego, California, named Hawke, came up with a unique idea. He used a film projector to project advertisements onto a screen at the front of the car, and they were all colored, in order to promote passenger attention.</p>
<h3>Automobile Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>Reduced Automobile Accidents in New York City New York is one of the most famous big cities in the world. It has a large population and its vehicular traffic has always been known for being congested. Therefore, the number of automobile accidents is the highest among the large cities in the United States with a population of over 500,000. The police authorities, seeing the increasingly serious accident rate, were deeply concerned about it. Therefore, starting in 1934, they implemented a sectional safety campaign, so that the responsibility for maintaining traffic safety would be shared by all parts of the police department in order to achieve a collaborative effect. In the two years since, the effect has been remarkable. The number of automobile accidents in the entire city has greatly decreased. The reason is that residents and various community groups regard the safety campaign as their own responsibility and cooperate sincerely, so that this good result can be achieved. According to the statistics of Police Commissioner Valentine, taking a nine-month period as an example, from January to September 1934, there were 27,323 vehicle accidents in New York City, resulting in 763 deaths and 32,564 injuries. In the same period in 1936, the number of accidents decreased to 20,176, with 587 deaths and 23,883 injuries. If calculated over a two-year period, the number of deaths decreased by 176, injuries decreased by 8,681, and the number of accidents decreased by 7,147. Comparing the nine-month period in 1936 with 1935 (from January 1st to October 1st), the number of deaths decreased by 125 and the number of injuries decreased by 2,294. The percentage of decrease was 176% for deaths and 8.77% for injuries.</p>
<p>Estimated Number of US Car Exports Last Year The exact statistics for the number of cars manufactured in the United States in 1936 and exported to various parts of the world have not yet been released. However, according to the estimate of Mr. Grayham, Chairman of the Export Committee of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, the number should be between 500,000 and 700,000 vehicles. The number of US car exports in 1932 was only 120,000 vehicles. In 1935, it was 508,000 vehicles. Therefore, the automobile business in 1936 can be said to be increasing day by day.</p>
<p>Toolbox Gradually Becoming Unimportant Mr. McMain, director of the Plymouth New York Service Department, recently stated that the progress of new cars in 1937 can be seen from one point, that is, the car's repair toolbox is becoming less and less important. Mr. Mai vaguely stated that not long ago, the toolbox was regarded as one of the most important parts of the car. Car users would carry a full set of repair tools whenever they went out. The number of parts could actually be used for ordinary car maintenance. As for the new cars, they were also equipped with many tools, the more the better. Moreover, the car owner would add the tools that they were used to. Today, the situation is different. The tools for changing tires only include, pliers and other items. there are thousands of miles and never opened the toolbox. Moreover, there are even those who do not even know what part of the car the toolbox is in.</p>
<p>Increased Hiring at the Packard Factory The Packard Factory has seen an increase in hiring due to increased exports. In mid-November, its number of employees reached 9,573. This was the fifth consecutive week that the number of employees has been broken. The highest record in 1935 was the last week of December, when the number of employees reached 6,959. The record last spring was 7,612. However, after mid-month, it reached 8,000 people. Last autumn, due to the addition of an axle factory, the number of employees also increased by 600. When the factory reopened, the number of employees increased by nearly 1,200.</p>
<p>Unclear Road View Makes It Very Easy to Have an Accident There are many reasons for automobile accidents. Accidents caused by unclear road views while driving are also one of the main reasons. According to Mr. Harley in the United States, roads with short lines of sight, such as mountain hills with turns in front that block the driver's view of the road ahead, are most prone to accidents. The American Society of Engineers has suggested that roads with a 1,000-foot road view are suitable for safe driving. Therefore, Mr. Harley also advocates that for two-way four-lane roads, drivers should have a clear view of the road ahead for at least 1,000 feet. For three-lane traffic, 1,500 feet is required to be considered safe.</p>
<p>Two New Inventions for Car Equipment There are two new inventions for car equipment in the American automobile industry. They are listed as follows. ㊀ Sand Spreader. When cars drive on icy or rainy roads, they often lose their balance due to excessive slippage, resulting in accidents. Mr. Borang, Deputy Director of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at New York University, has recently invented a kind of sand spreader. It is quite ingenious to transform the obstacle remover at the front end of the car. The method is to modify the obstacle remover into a sand box. The upper end opens with a door for forming sand. A button connects it to the management dashboard. When sand is needed, it can be done with a move of the hand, and the effect is immediately visible. ㊁ Convertible Top. Convertible tops are most popular with ladies traveling on beautiful spring and summer days. However, there is one regret, that is, the installation of the car top is quite troublesome. A company in New York, USA, has recently created a car top that can be automatically opened. It only takes one or two seconds to install it properly. The principle is to use compressed air. The air storage tank is hidden inside the car and does not take up much space. The air pressure stored in it can be used to open and lower the car top fifteen times. Its operation does not interfere with parking or driving.</p>
<h3>The Value of Modern Automobiles</h3>
<p>"Those who purchase modern American automobiles rarely know the real value they receive. Most people think that the heavier the car, the greater its power. However, Mr. Ford thinks otherwise. Years ago, when he was the general manager of a certain railway, he began to propose using lighter railway equipment. At that time, few understood, and some even criticized him. Now we can see that trains made of lighter metal are breaking all records. If a car reaches a lighter weight, its power also increases for the following two reasons:</p>
<p>㊀ Due to simple design. ㊁ Due to the development of special steels for each part. Currently, Ford cars use about thirty-six kinds of specially developed steels. Naturally, the weight is lighter, and the price is also lower. In 1935, automobiles were worth US$41 per hundred pounds, or 41 cents per pound. The new Ford cars that have just been displayed have one type that is worth about 20 cents per pound. This way of estimating the value of automobiles is certainly unusual, but it shows how automobiles compare to other necessities of life. American steak costs US$0.30 per pound, an electric refrigerator costs about US$0.40 per pound, a piano costs about US$0.87 per pound, good, unwired broadcloth costs about US$1.65 per pound, and a suit costs about US$7.50 per pound. All of these are excellent values, while the value of automobiles is US$0.20 per pound. This kind of news is worth knowing. Years ago, if you wanted to buy all the features of a Ford that is now worth US$480, it would have been difficult to do so even for US$15,000. This assumes that the various improvements of today were already available at that time. In fact, at that time, all these features were missing. Among the masses, there are always clever people who will say, "Oh, I know why the price can be reduced, and the real value has increased. I'm afraid you've been reducing the labor hours!" In fact, taking the entire automobile industry as a whole, for the same automobile production volume, in 1929, it took 74 workers, while now it takes 78 workers. This is only seven years ago. Therefore, the number of workers employed per car has increased. Why is this? Is it because the efficiency of the workers is not as good as before? Or is it because the management is not as focused as before? Neither is the case. The real reason is that the new cars require more assembly and completion work than before. Because every part of the car itself is better than before, both time and work have increased. Therefore, in addition to supplying us with commodities, the automobile industry has also established a great principle: the more superior and beautiful an item is, the more accessible it is to the public. Only crude and imprecise products, and those full of errors, are expensive."</p>
