<p>時評</p>
<h3>華北走私危機的增重</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>華北走私危機的嚴重。最近又引起各方面的注意。這不是偶然的。綏遠的軍事侵略似乎綏和一點這種經濟的侵略就突現在我們眼前同時我們內政的問題漸得解决。一般人又都集中注意到對外的問題。據最近天津消息某方私貨又以排山倒海的形勢。大量侵入。而海關總稅務司梅樂和的報告。說起一九三六年華北關稅所受走私的損失。竟達五千萬元之鉅。這種可驚的消息。真是誰都不容忽視的。</p>
<p>華北有組織的走私。開始於一九三五年夏。到去年五月中而達最高點。這以後。經過我國的嚴密取締與杜防。比較上已經减少一點。然而這種有計劃有組織的經濟侵略活動。是與侵略者的軍事政治勢力密切聯緊着的。它的繼續與擴大。始終還沒有受到根本的阻遏。去年十二月太平洋學會月刊登載漢遜氏一文。在“走私者軍人與外交家”的標題下。說華北的走私活動。由這幾種人物聯合發動。已經摧毀了我國北部一百五十哩的關稅壁壘。衝入幾千噸的白糖。無數哩長的棉布。足供數百萬雙絲襪製造原料的人造絲。與可以阻塞中國每個男女兒童喉口的捲烟用紙。這種私貨由大連起裝。以十艘至三十艘的汽船為一隊。越北直隸海灣。沿北戴河而下。有軍力的公開保障與外交的暗中衛護。故能聲勢洶洶。所向無阻。他們以冀東偽自治區為根據地由此遍達於華北和長江流域各地這種情形不僅成為破壞我國財政與工業的一種毒癌。而且對于其他各國的正常貿易與借欵擔保也給與了重大的打擊。據梅樂和氏的報告。𣼣稅的貨之中。煤油佔不小部分。這對於英美蘇聯煤油商行的打擊。是很重大的。同時。去年秦皇島與天津關稅的收入。較以前减低了百分之三十。使英美等國以關稅為擔保的借欵。都受了不小的影響。</p>
<p>對於走私活動的防阻。向來是注重在鐵路方面的檢查。但武裝私販改用汽車。由公路直達內地。就很難有適當的取締辦法。當然。這個毒癌的根本病源。我們是認得清楚的。它的根源是由於侵略者政治軍事勢力的深入。最具體的例子。是冀東偽自治區的存在。與長城各口的落在他人手中。在最近華北走私危機復趨嚴重之中。我們應當積極注意到這種根本的問題。緩遠的抗戰。我方已佔顯明的優勢。目前對於這種經濟的侵略。我們也當以堅决的步驟。求其澈底的消滅。</p>

<p>［東京］陸軍拒絕入閣、宇垣大將組閣工作、在情勢上一般視為完全絕望、但宇垣大將之態度、並不就此告辭、仍擬愼重考慮今後方針、講求第二步與第三步之策略、對於組閣實未絕望、現正苦慮其打開局面之任何辦法云（二十六日同盟電）</p>

<p>［東京］杉山教育總監、從今日上午九時起至十時止、在陸相官邸與寺內陸相、關於陸軍對宇垣大將組閣之態度、協議一切、惟因陸軍部內之情勢益趨硬化、不能放任不理、杉山大將為宇垣氏之友、乃以個人之資格、於上午十一時起赴組閣本部、訪宇垣大將、更詳細說明陸軍部內之情勢、婉曲要求宇垣大將加以深甚之考慮、並謂宇垣大將雖請寺內陸相推薦後任陸相、然熙目下部內之情勢、縱令推薦、其人必固辭不就、結果推薦極難、此時希望宇垣大將正確認識目下之部內情勢而善處之云、可知事勢益趨險惡、組閣前途更難樂觀、杉山大將晤宇垣大將後、在陸相官邸語記者曰、余本日訪宇垣大將、乃忽有入閣云云之謠、其實至非此事、余不過以私人資格、詳細說至明陸軍部內之情勢而已、其內客不能詳以奉告云、（二十六日同盟電）</p>

<p>［東京］建川中將與宇垣大將會見、略謂、陸相認宇垣大將若就總理之任、事勢善惡姑置勿論、而軍部全體之空氣、將有惹起極堪憂慮之虞、在肅軍中途而陷於此種狀態、實屬無理、故全軍一致希望宇垣大將拜辭上命、並設法善處為要、特此轉達云、（二十六日同盟電）</p>

<p>［東京］聞宇垣組閣之方針可如下述、㊀為實現革新政治之一元化強力行政起見、遴選幹練多才之人物、充任閣員、閣員席數限為六七名、由一人兼任數省政務、各省政務次官均予廢除、㊁算重國會制度、改造既有之政黨、使在名義上及實質上能實施緊急時期之國第、設閣員在政黨中遴選、則彼等應放棄黨籍、（二十六日中央社電）</p>

<h3>風雨東來……雲山北向（上）</h3>
<p>— 本報特派記者　明心</p>
<p>此行由鄭而洛、西去潼華、所過崤函之險、蓋中原歷史上最早之勝地、遂憶孟明之諫秦師曰、𠴳有二陵、余收爾骨焉、秦不能聽、卒以敗績、以古方今、陝變遽起、將母同焉、又行蹤汗漫、逾潼而至河東、北向入晋、迄於陽曲、低徊少陵之俊句、殊咸時地之相同、掇以名篇、用資喤引、</p>
<p>潼關之行、逗留二日、所得軍備之概况略具於前、潼關西向為東泉店、華陰、下營、柳枝、而至華縣、不過數十公里、行程經時可達、然目下以征戌頻繁、票車停開、每日僅有交通車一次、以供軍路之用、中途又因讓車卸糧、或至四五小時僅乃得達華縣、雖州治土城甚小、自軍隊來駐、可謂全城入於軍事狀態之中、非特居所不足供張、即飲食什貨、亦難為繼、所幸軍隊紀律極佳、餉秣亦足、因之鄉民非特不逃避、且從而開設臨時之飯館什貨舖者至三十余家、一時市面為之繁榮、亦兵凶中之反映也、</p>
<p>軍事配備、事涉機要、聞者勿群、對方最前綫均張部、自一零四至一零九凡六師、若劉多荃繆徵流諸部㣲聞張部內向較殷、惟一以具體尚在研討、一以眷屬多在後方、故現尚待相當之時機、至中央對此仍未放棄和平之立場、故米春霖李志剛之流、日昨又飛西安、而某要員於離去太原之際、更對記者公開稱“陝甘已有妥善辦法、絕非大不了事、彼此均非敵人、應能了解、此僅一時糾紛、短期內當可和平解决、惟中國是整個的、絕不容有兩個政府、希望共匪澈底覺悟、取消偽組織、”凡此均見於晋報、可以覆按、惟在前方工作者、或主速為忍痛解决之辦法、蓋一恐夜長夢多、共黨之勢力日盛、一以內向部隊、非在交綏以後、無由表現、若論兵力、何止十百之比、旬日底定、蓋可預期、此則各以環境之不同、而意見遂亦少有同異、但有統籌之道、自可殊途同歸、目下則和戰尚在謎局中也、</p>
<p>西安內部、因交通之阻隔、傳聞異詞、但十六日楊于會有願就新職、並取消十二月十二日以後其他組織之通電、全文均經讀悉、至其是否出於誠意、乃至以後之如何辦法、則未容推究、當觀事實為之證明耳、西安兵力甚單、楊虎城僅有一師一旅之眾、城中即駐一師、至其政訓人員、多已為共匪所參加、東北系之孫銘九任軍警督察處長、戒備甚嚴、或謂楊亦已受共黨之包圍監視、而不能措置自由者、共匪大部集於陝北、一方擬南至渭河、一方又仍在趕造皮筏冀以丟年渡河辦法、衝入晋省、至渭水前方、亦有少數共匪、（臨時之土匪民國亦自變相在內、）渭南西安均遭却掠、而渭南尤十室九空、孫蔚如素有大志、此次頗欲膺新命、卒為共匪所阻、至馮飲哉與楊私交極篤、駐防渭北、亦嘗到潼關、據謂此時頗急欲得一辦法、以拯楊氏之晚節、渠尚有留守西安之辦事處、可以與楊通聞問、但楊在刦持之下、是否能因老友袍澤之陳詞、而翩然定計、則又未易論定者矣、</p>
<p>楊虎臣本人自視極高、雖不工文翰、而饒具智略、每日屬秘書口誦公事、郤能正其錯誤、至濡毫染翰、視為畏途、有時開會親筆簽名極春蛇秋蚓之能事、而輒自撝謙曰、此為技術問題、非所能強也、又演說談訊、好用新名詞、如目的團體之流、蓋前清張文襄所謂日本土話、屏不肯用者也、尤喜用藝術二字、而不甚得當、見朋從之御新衣者、亦曰君衣殊藝術化、合座往往為之撫掌、至馮欽哉則豪邁不羣、所愛好者臨池聽歌兩事、自組一改良陝西梆子班、客至輙召之爨弄、以得人鼓掌呌好為樂、實則陜梆子極不易懂、欲索解人、百無一二、又常日書魏碑、峻整彌有法度、凡人之求書者、均欣然應之、自備佳楮、一揮而就、次日送之行館矣、閒則行博好勝之心、往往流露、有扣其和張者、甚至面斥之、英雄本色固不當如是耶、</p>
<p>陝變之起、推厥原因、初非一二語所能盡、要之則陝軍排外之心理、有以釀成之、蓋楊虎臣治軍鄉里、自此藩封、已非一日、自張部之移駐、勢力已較减損、再繼以國人高呼開發西北、隴海路又通至長安、省府改組、因而去職、於是陝人之智識淺薄者、以為長此而往、勢難維持、楊尤不甘以陝軍領袖、坐見陝人之失勢、其不從國家大器立想、深可浩嘆、而主持新事業者、又多外省人士因之積不能平、課解政府開發之美意、為掠奪當地之生機、即去年丘元武之被慘殺、報館之為人塗污糞穢、均其心理之逐步表現也、張部則人數浩繁、舉家西來、亦難存活、雖部隊領袖、未嘗通共、而家族子侄、𢡝於無出路之可循、因之思想或不免涉於左傾之途、惟張學良以與蔣委長個人之關係、故於二十五日尚能躬送回京、而其部隊亦即內向較殷、至楊虎臣本亦非了解共產、而亦必不為共匪所容者、惟事勢所迫、挺以涉險、同時共匪得此機會、又必盡量利用、俾任傀儡、楊以不學之流、惑於一時之流言、遂置陷身而不恤、倘更遷延、且難自拔、必至玉石俱焚矣、（二十日潼關述太原發）</p>

<h3>幾個有關英語教學的中等教育問題（一）</h3>
<p>— 王世杰</p>
<p>一月二十六日中央廣播電臺講演</p>
<p>諸位聽眾、</p>
<p>今天中國西方語學會開大會於北平、到會的人有各地方大學和中學的教員、會期一共三天、所討論的主要題目與全國的大學和中學都有關係、這是一個重要的學術會議、我今天被邀請、說幾句話、就乘這個機會討論一個與大會有關係的題目、就是“幾個有關英語教學的中等教育問題”、在未討論之先、我有兩點簡單的聲明、第一、我不是以專家態度、討論專門的題目、這是大會本身的事、並且我今天也沒有時間、我所要說的話、是想根據教育大政方針、來討論這個問題、第二、中等教育範圍包括很廣、我所說的、只是全部的一部份、中等教育自有他整個的性質與精神、所以我今天選擇這個題目、提出幾個比較基本的問題、加以討論並將這個題目分作五段來講、</p>
<p>第一、中等教育應當培養切合適用的知識、中等救育就學校的組織上說、雖可以分為中學•師範學校•職業學校等門類、這只是訓練方法上的便利、他們中間確有公同的基礎、公同的原則與公同的目標、公同基礎、最顯明的事實、就是這些學校學生的標準年齡差不多完全相同、這是表示中等教育在學生生理發展的過程上有共同的基礎、這只是公同基礎中最基本最顯著的一種、中等教育的目標是根據這些公同基礎的、其中的一個就是培養學生的知識關於這一點、大家並沒有分歧的意見、但是知識的問題、意義極為寬汎、內容極為複雜、並且是隨着時代而進步、在今日的中國、處在現世界的知識情况之下、辨理中等教育、應當培養那一類的知識、培養到甚麼程度、並用甚麼方法去培養纔得到最好的效果、在此處、大家的意見就不免有很大的不一致、問題既公認為這般的重要、我們似乎應該對於他有深切的認識、確定的信念、一致的主張、與澈底的努力、中國辦理中等教育有好幾十年、其間在各方面有過許多的改革到今天就大體上說、比起從前來、的確有相當的進步、但是在別的方面、也有許多令人極不滿意的事情大家都感覺到了、其中的一件、就是許多受過中等教育的學生在學校裏所學的知識、進入社會後不能應用他們畢業之後纔發覺自己所學的、不合於社會的需要在社會上不能謀生活以致於失業、社會上所需要的知識大致說起來、是循着分工合作的路徑、各行有各行的知識與技能、也須相當的純熟、不僅比較專門事業是如此、工商之類、更不用說、就是比較普通之職業、也需要相當特有的知識、但是中國的學生與辦理教育的人、對於知識最大的毛病、就是輕視實用、這個原因不甚明瞭、也許是因為切合實用的知識、其功效是有限制的、是比較窄狹的、正如一件切合實用的工具、是有限的、只能切合於一件工作、不能同時適用於許多的工作、我現在隨使舉幾個例子往往一個學生在書本上能夥說明物競天擇優勝劣敗生物學上的大道理、一到曠野、見到生物界的現象、如鳥飛獸走、並不及一個農夫能夠了解、這些飛禽走獸的活動是與他自己朝夕勤勞為着謀生有同樣的意義、這個比喻並非太過、顯然是一個知識是切合實用的、一個的知識是不切合實用的又如許多的學生在數學上或物理學上常常見到度量衡的名詞、但是一到實際生活上、反不知道一公尺有多長、一公斤有多重、在書本上知道許多植物動物的名詞、但自家園裏的樹木或本地田野的鳥獸反而不知道名字與習性、中等學校的教材與教授法、習於抽象、太不注重實用、受過這樣教育的學生畢業之後如果不為社會所歡迎、當然不能完全抱怨社會、目前畢業生失業的情形恐怕相當的普遍、雖然中等學校與大學畢業的就業狀况、沒有可靠的統計、但從一件事可以看出一些情形來、前些時候、政府辦了一個大學畢業生就業訓練班、其原因是幾千大學的畢業生、不能夠自己謀生活、必須另外加以訓練、那個訓練班還只是對於最近三數年的大學畢業生、若將歷來大學畢業生計算在內當然不止此數、中等學校畢業生若是也照這樣辦一個訓練班、恐怕人數要加到許多倍、自然、這個情形、不完全由學生負責、也是社會上整個問題的一部份但是許多受過教育的學生反而不能自謀最低限度的生活、這在辦學的人與求學的人、都是一件很大的失收、一個國家要復興起來、就得做到庶政上百廢俱舉目前中國建設的事業、無論在那一方面都感覺到切合實用的人材的缺乏、受過教育的人、一遇到實際的問題、往往感覺到無應付的能力、這種切合實用的人材的缺乏、與國家的前途很有影響、應當切實的補救、補救的方法、自然還是教育、高等教育與中等教育都應當使學生的知識切合實用、更應當從中等教育做起、（未完）</p>

<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>標紗多頭掉期</p>
<p>吐出二月補進遠期　同業仍居空頭地位</p>
<p>紗市晨漲午疲、但氣勢尚挺蓋以印商在多頭地位仍來拖進加碼、惟一部份附和者稍形了結、同業鑒於紗廠全部開車、日夜趕工製造、生產量大增加、三品紗市亦復回挫、故心思傾向拋賣、不過粗紗滇粵兩帮進胃突健、市面被其激昂矣、</p>
<p>長豐賡豐最賣午買　標紗前市開盤、各月一致上升、良以上日一月期、交割價格堅昂、同時現紗南方採辦尤殷、人心愈堅、多方開始掉期、將二月吐出、遠月補進、因此遠期漲風亦起、但大阪三品紗價步步下降、現紗綫跌風更熾四元至十元、然本埠未受絲亳影響、標紗結果各月比上日收盤價均漲一元四角、至一元二角、午後開盤市况平平、一盤忽跌一元一角至三•七角、以三品紗來電盤盤下墮、且同業拋賣、但多方有進有出、迨至三收盤、聞現紗生意不惡、又復同上、結果各月比上午收盤價跌二•三•九角、長農賡豐大昌成晨賣午買、查資出愼益三千五百五十包、大豐八百包、錦昌三千三百五十包、瑞大二千二百五十包、森康七百五十包，協成一千一百包、同和一千四百包大慶一千包、益昶二千二百五十包、福康一千二百包、買進裕火五千七百五十包、慎記一千二百五十包、長餘一千包、豊泰二千包、愼記一千六百包、仁豐一千六百包、望泰興一千四百六十包、恒昌一千一百五十包、長豐三千包、大昶一千三百包、永大一千一百五十包、信誠一千五百包、　日間最高　價列左、</p>
<p>紗銷起色原棉尚稱穩固</p>
<p>午前浮空抵補甚急</p>
<p>棉市始漲繼跌、趨勢仍屬平庸良以印美棉市不脫培澹之境人心平平、不過紗銷起色、原料當能穩固一步、而各路來源轉趨凋落、蓋因廢歷年關、花行大都停秤結束矣、</p>
<p>標花晨漲午回　標花前市開盤、各月微見上漲、因紗市轉趨高翔、現紗銷場略佳、廠方對於原料或有購辦可能浮戶花補尤急、但印美棉市仍屬渙散無勁、大阪三品抵跌六•七角之譜標花結果各月比上日收盤價均漲二角半至四角、午後開盤忽跌二角、市情尤鬆懈、以大阪三品花頻頻下落、而現棉生意甚清、買者缺乏結果各月比上午收盤跌價二角至二角半、杳賣出梅記一千擔、泰昌二千一百擔協成一千一百擔、永大一千四百擔、大豊一千擔、錦昌一千一百擔、豊泰一千九百擔、買進通記四千七百擔、賡豊四千七百擔、元二千六百擔、益昶一千擔、潤康一千一百擔、瑞大一千擔、望泰興一千三百擔、一日間最高低價列左、</p>
<p>現棉祇做姚花一種　現棉消費轉趨岑寂廠胃不爽、來源姚花四百包、通花三百九十三包、</p>
<p>傳聞中恢復紗花六個月期之辦法</p>
<p>本月期祇准做了結　另五個月照常買賣</p>
<p>華商紗布交易所標準紗花市場、向做六個月期貨、去年紗花市價狂刊猛降、一日數變、為取締投機起見、自去年十一月六日起、將月期縮短、祇拍五個月期、故至十二月一日僅剩四個月期、又祇准拍四個日期、相沿迄今、惟各方面深以此種限制為不便、百計恢復六個月期、傳聞中擬議恢復之六個月期辦法本月期祇准做了結、而其余之五個月期、仍可照做新買賣、舉例以言、二月分起、如做六個月期、可做至七月期而一入二月分、原有之二月期貨祇准了結、不准做新買賣也、蓋投機風潮之發動、胥為本月期軋空軋多而起、本月期如只做了結、投機者即少一工具、所間如是、姑誌之以備一說、</p>
<p>美棉受出售押棉之影響</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况欠活、各月跌一至四磅音、同業正研究押棉等級之差異眾意此項等級之不同、將使市價高於售價、因之押欵棉花一時亦難於售罄、惟內容並不若是簡單故對於場內市價之影響甚㣲、其後因利物浦消息不良、隔夜多頭了結、市價疲軟、收盤前幸賴同業買進近月、一部份回好、計現貨漲一磅音、期貨漲一磅音至缺五磅音英棉現貨跌四點、期貨跌三點、印棉初因股市有力、出口商及空戶買進而漲、旋以日本政局不寗而回卒因美國押欵棉花細則之解釋、利於買方、市價再昂、計平果爾漲半羅比奧姆辣漲○•二九羅比、白羅溪漲○•五至○•七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十五日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十日六開盤預測、白羅溪為二百二十五羅比、奧姆辣為二百○四羅比半、漲○七五羅比、平果爾為一百七十六羅比、漲半羅比、</p>

<h3>特種現金保證辦法</h3>
<p>銀行公會發表全文</p>
<p>中央社云、銀行界為改進保證制度、創行特種現金保證辦法、經銀行公會奉實業部令、詳加研討、認為完密妥善切實可行、故各銀行已計議採用聞有數銀行、帥將實施、該制度係交通銀行總經理唐壽民、及該行秘書兼人事課課長王維駟所規劃、並得各界贊許、茲據銀行公會發表該辦法全文如次、</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>我國銀行之現行行員保證、都採個人保單制度、行員在就職以前、頒覓妥保、為之塡寫保單、經審查合格後、方准進行辦事、慣例相沿、歷有年所、在以前社會機構單純之時、固有相當效用、洎乎今日、情勢不變、流弊滋、生糾紛迭起、此種人事的保證制度、亟須加以改革、似為同業普遍之感覺、嘗考目下改革保證制度、主張最多者、厥為改無限保證為有限保證、夫有限保證、必須將保證之限度加以釐定、過高則駭人聽聞、覓保仍難過低則保障不足、風險彌大、且各人職務、時有更易、錢財責任、前後互異、萬不能將保證之限度、隨職務而變更、故此種妥洽性之改革辦法、仍非根本解决保證困難之道、至歐美各國盛行之行員信用保險、業經詳加研究、因中外薪給高低不同、及匯兌關係、似覺手續繁瑣、費率太高、年納保費、為數過矩、且照美國之信用保險公司辦法、凡國外向其投保者、因海外損失費用、如調查整理佣金雜耗等、勢須增加保費、故除納原有保費外、在歐洲及亞洲之保戶、均須另加費用、如人數眾多之行、數額亦屬可觀、在我國現狀之下、如欲仿行、窒碍亦多、我人旁徵博引、再四籌維、認為非廢除人的保證、不能澈底改良保證之制度、爰擬建議“特種現金保證辦法”、以銀行與行員共同合作”“相互保險”為手段、達到“分散危險”“防止舞弊”之目的、寓“儲蓄”之美意、採“保險”精神、結果可“自力更生”收“自治治人”之效、較之舊式保單制度、似較切實而合理較之信用保險制度、尤易實施而合算、用特將改革之動機、及群細方案、縷述如後、</p>
<p>廢除現行保證制度之理由</p>
<p>凡一種制度必為適應一時代社會環境之產物、故制度而不隨環境以演變、則失却適應環境之能力、運轉失靈、動生扞格、舊式之行員保單辦法、為曩昔農業及手工時代之產品、以之應用於經濟機構錯綜複雜之工商時代、宜其捉襟見時、不切實用、我人歸納其缺點、約有數端、</p>
<p>一、銀行方面</p>
<p>第一、銀行為事擇人、理宜羅致英才、為行服務、顧常有優秀之人才、而苦無合格之保證、如予苛求、則不啻屏諸門外、遺珠之憾、在所不免、如予通融、則一旦出事、保人無力賠償、行將損失不貲、</p>
<p>第二、銀行於行員進行之前、例須調查保人之身家、姑無論掛一𣺘萬、調查難期詳確、即能洞明底蘊、而人事經濟、時在變化、常有為人保證之時、身家確屬殷實、而行員舞弊發生以後、境况已非昔比、</p>
<p>第三、保人在社會上有相當聲望者、實際上往往未必具有充當保證人之資力、銀行對於行員之提供此種人為保證人者、如予拒絕、則間接有傷情感、如勉予接受、則保人資力不足、危險堪虞、進退維谷、左右為難、</p>
<p>第四　行員保人、果能合乎標準、而在茲人慾橫流之時舞弊案情之重大、往往出乎保人賠償能力以外、保人對於保證責任、守約有願實踐無方、銀行欲加株求、須經法律之裁判、涉訟經年、取償難期、</p>
<p>第五　保人倘有特殊勢力者、如須屨行賠償責任時、行方欲向其追償損失甚為困難、即使訴追、而保人必多方延宕、推諉卸責、甚且置之不理、</p>
<p>第六　現行保證制度、必俟舞弊發生後、方由保證人出資賠償、故僅消極的謀事後之補救、不能積極的為事前之預防、</p>
<p>第七　新進行員之保證人、銀行固須詳細調查對保、即在職行員之保證人、銀行亦有每年對保一次之慣例郵書紛馳、精神與費用之耗費、為數必甚可觀、</p>
<p>二、行員方面</p>
<p>第一　年來世風澆漓、人心不古、行員捲席侵占、時有所聞、求人作保、難如登天、况無限责任之保證、更令人不寒而慄、苟非至戚、誰敢承當、故凡入银行服務者、第一重難關、即為覓保、如無適當保人、雖有卓越之才具、亦無進身之機會、（最近上海某大銀行錄取新行員十名、其中八人、因無適當保人、均不得進行股務、又某商業銀行錄取練習生多人、其中一人成績甚優、因先後提保七次、均不合格、竟至自殺、）因此社會多賦閒才英才、銀行有才難之遺憾、夫人才為推進事業之動力、保證謹防動力之越軌、故原則上、人才為主、保證為輔、自不待言、今若因保證不合而棄才不用、捨本逐末、是為社會之浪費、銀行業之損失、</p>
<p>第二　近年以來、行員舞弊案件、層見疊出、退保函件、日有數起、不惟在職行員惴惴自危、造成人心之浮動影響服務之效率、抑且被退保者、能否另覓妥保、殊屬疑問、萬一續保無人、惟有解除職務我人推想、銀行當局造成行員豐富之經騐、熟練之技術、其所費之精神財力、消磨之寶貴光陰、不可勝計、今也、正當發探其才識為行服務之際、而遽以保人問題、令其中途退職、實豐銀行及行員雙方莫大之損失、</p>
<p>第三　我國銀行業、鑒於優秀人才之寶貴、晚近進用行員、採用嚴格考試者漸多、此種制度之優點、在於杜絕權勢之推薦、剔除庸才之倖進、秉客觀之目光、樹人才之標準、若仍責令錄取之人、提交妥保、使清寒無助之人、望洋興嘆、是選擇人才、固已化秘密為公開、而就階梯、艱難如故、方策兩歧、前後矛盾、</p>
<p>第四　查現今各銀行慣例、總行重員或分行經副理、大率均無保人、而此種重員、憑藉地位、侵占舞弊、機會更多、目手段靈敏、數額浩大、報章騰戰、歷歷可稽、</p>
<p>三、保人方面</p>
<p>第一　近年來世風日下、浮靡惡習蔚成風氣、銀行行員舞弊案件、報章所載、自二十三年一月至二十四年二月間、共三十八件、計洋一百四十四萬元其未刊載報章者、恐尚不止此數、銀行本身係有限公司組織、而行員保證人、須無限責任、殊不合理、故為人保證、莫不談虎色變、憚於嘗試、已為社會上普遍之現象、</p>
<p>第二　據調查所得、殷實熱心之人、為人保證、有每人担保數人至数十人者、無論其身家如何富有、願以一人之資力、担負十餘人職務上之無限責任、未免過於冒險、</p>
<p>第三　過去為人保證者、大率因至親友好、謀得職業後、請求作保、如予拒絕、則不啻斷其生路、不特心所不安、益且受人唾駡、迫不獲已、於是權為作保、是其承保之時、原非心之所願、及既保之後、又如芒刺在背、寢饋難安、迨偶生事變、尚須強其履行保證責任、壓迫重重、實為不合理之尤者、如或改無限責任為有限責任、則僅减轻保人之責任、對於改善保證制度、仍未澈底解决、</p>
<p>第四　現行銀行保證制度大部份均於保單內、書明拋棄先訴抗辯權之條欵、故解釋上、其責任與主債務人、並無先後之分、不幸而被保者發生舞弊、銀行得逕向保證人追償損失、富者傾家蕩產、不足繼以縲絏、貧者債台高築、甚至消極自盡、（上年徐州曾發生保人被累自殺案、見各報紀載）、此種悲慘之事實、有碍社會之安寗、而權勢浩大、情感素篤者、銀行亦無法激底追究惟有受損而已、</p>
<p>第五　過去保人被累者時有所聞、故年來殷實自愛之人、懲前毖後、均不願重作憑婦、而為人保證者、反多境况平平之輩、此種變態之事實殊背保證之本旨、</p>
<p>現行保證制度、利少弊多、已無存在之價值、不容諱飾、歐美各國、三十年前、雖亦有個人作保者、一如我國之習慣、旋即隨經濟機構之演進、已無為他人作保之事實、（參閱祁著保證）至主張漸進主義、一面維持保人、一面採用現金保證、似為過渡之良法、惟手續繁瑣更增困難、既非根本改善保證之道、亦與今日社會趨勢相背馳、茲為解除行員覓保困離及保陣銀行利益起見、爰有“特種現金保證辦法”之擬議、竊以是項辦法、施行便易、上述困難、悉可蠲免、而資金之徵集、來自多方、眾擊易舉、集腋成裘、數年之後、百萬鉅欵、不難舉措、照原案甲種保證金之規定、取法於英國、乙種保證金之規定、效法於美國、（聞台灣銀行之“身元保證金”性質相仿）至丙種保證金、則參照吾國情形、予以規定、且現金保證、因各人本身利害關係、意外事件、可冀逐漸减少、而連帶處分之規定、尤可收互相監督之效也、（未完）</p>

<h3>兩婦人兜售偽幣</h3>
<p>各判刑六年</p>
<p>絲業掮客湖州人嚴子蘭、近在狄思威路偽綠路一小茶館中啜茗、遇一揚州婦人王徐氏、向其兜售中央通商兩銀行偽法幣、其價頗廉、如真幣三十元、可購暨鼎者百元嚴佯稱欲買中央五元偽幣二百元、一元幣一百元、暨角栗百元、</p>
<p>共四百元　王徐氏答以均有、約前日下午五時在奉天路拓阜路附近交幣、不過須備就現欵接洽嚴尤之、而是項假鈔票對於社會害人不淺、遂據情密報嘉興路捕房派華探目金養吾•探員董慶權、由嚴按時以</p>
<p>農民銀行　十元真幣一張蓋面、余均冥國銀行紙幣用紙包就似百元模樣•前往所約地點等候兩探員預伏他處、察看動靜、移時王徐氏偕同鄉婦人龔錢氏到來、嚴子蘭即袖出農民</p>

<h3>繁華公司縱火圖賠案法官勘視火場</h3>
<p>楓窗雖燒焦但未全燬於火　引火物隨處亂放情節顯然</p>
<p>本月二十一日深夜二時余、福州路五百四十八號門牌繁華服裝公司突然起火、經救火會灌救甚久、始告撲滅、嗣經該管老閘捕房華探長陸根生•探目憑秀山•朱尚和•等查得該公司會保有火險五萬元、此次實係縱火圖得賠欵、遂將該公司股東兼經理吳子良•股東吳松森•賬房張奎伯•</p>

<p>視察一過　見店內置放貨物之玻璃櫥窗均為燒焦、而不全燬於火、顯見當放火時必將戤土林隨處亂放、郎提黃常根加以詢問、據黃供、當時將戤士林盛於金魚缸內、即在樓下後面貨房內置放四缸、樓上後樓置放二缸、而以蘆蓆報紙散於四週、乃引火使之燃燒、但否認將戤士林</p>
<p>置於他處　而錢庭長認為若引火物不置放於前面之店堂內、則店堂內之橱窗等被燬情形、决不如此、故訊以究屬如何、但黃則堅持其說、而救火會西員、則稱當火起後於二分半鐘內即驅救火車到達、見滿屋盡為火團、若僅將戤士林置於後面房內、則火必無如此</p>
<p>猛烈現狀　由此亦可證明當時前後屋內均有引火物置在、錢庭長旋在樓上樓下詳察之下、令捕房將未經全部燬去之橱窗等予以拍照、繳案參證後即行返院、</p>

<p>小故涉訟　致將來後悔不及、故本推事之意思、本案實以和解為上、而被告律師吳麟坤起稱、被告對鈞院善意、極表同情前經親友之調停、即將四十餘萬元之財產過于之戶名、即將一切印鑑等交與原告保管、以為和解條件、乃後原告忽予悔約、茲又生本件之訴、故應請庭上諭令原告</p>
<p>稍予退步　則和解實非不可能等說、庭上即向俞•陸•二人詢問、原告是否有寄存首飾之事、二人均答已由原告取去、繼詢陸程氏及證人吳壽峰一過、時已逾午、詹推事即宣告改期、着兩造出外試行和解、原告代理律師聲請着兩被告交保庭上以被告既遵傳到案、自無交保必要、故將聲請駁回、</p>

<h3>貢獻話家庭與第一流國貨</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>試問任何一個家庭與任何一位主婦以對於國貨之意見，必一致以購用優良國貨，而希望國貨工廠之各以改進國貨製造為當務之急。換言之，人人欲得第一流之國貨，以為服用之資，是則人同此心，心同此理，顧欲得第一流之國貨，一半在用戶之提倡與鼓勵，而一半在製造者之忠實與勇氣。提倡鼓勵之責任，第一在有信心，堅信非用國貨，决不足以救國，决不能解决经濟國難之局面。第二在能原諒，當知國貨之質，雖不如外貨，國貨之價，雖昂於外貨，顧既為中國人，惟有用中國貨，質美價廉，不難待諸異日。第三在有辨別力，何者為國貨，何者為非國貨，國貨之優點何在！可取與應改良之處何在？皆吾用戶之責也。工廠方面，以忠實之態度，與勇於改進之决必，則第一流國貨之名，當然受之而無愧。經營一工廠，當知有三大要點：㊀在購置優良機器，工欲善其事，必先利其器，有優良機器，然後能製造優良出品，苟常滯於手工製造，以粗製濫造為能事者，决不能倖存於工業競爭之時代。㊁在雖致技術人才今後國貨欲與外貨競爭，舍技術外無他戰勝之方。技術不良，必受淘汰。每年國內外造就之專門人才，無使其無用武之地，更不使其改入政途，或藉教師職業以終其身。最近實業部長吳鼎昌氏，辦國貨聯營公司，就盈餘中提出國貸製造改良費百分之三十，國貨人才訓練費百分之十，其重視人才之訓練與技術之改進，目光如炬，各方景仰。㊂在成本之减低，國貨與非國貨之競爭，於改良製造之外，尤在成本之减低。何種消耗可以節省，何種廢料可以利用，如何增進工作效能，更如伺可以减少人工，凡此均於試行成本會計上為重大之問題在平日不容不深切研究。更為欲求達到第一流國貨者，所不可不知，許屈璜女士，條陳國貨根本辦法七條，於培植專門人才一項，旣特別注意，旣佩其見解之高卓，對於國貨商人處處應為家庭用戶謀購物便利一端，如各店設國貨諮詢部，各學校設國貨樣品陳列處，國貨公司辦競買獎勵證，遍設分公司，均為第一流國貨工廠與家庭學校間應有之聯絡，茲得家庭訪問之結果，以有此戲議，希望二十六年凡第一流工廠之領袖，各以吾人期望所在，引為急切之任務，一致努力，以慰愛用國貨士女之殷願，不覺拭目以待。</p>
<h3>國貨界應有的新計劃</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>新的年頭，又很快地將過去了一個月，我們國貨的進行，是在很艱苦的奮鬥中，繼續努力，“一年之計在於春，這是古人很明白地告訴我們，一個事業的進展，它是必要預定一個新的計劃，於年頭開始時，然後不斷地加以完成，貫澈和實現。</p>
<p>因此，在這時候，我很深切地感覺到我們整個的國貨界，是應該及早有一個嚴密的切實的新計劇，環顧當前的情勢，確定今後國貨開展的中心工作，這是萬分迫切的任務，在這裏，找特別提出了三點，敢貢獻給全體從事國貨事業的人們：</p>
<p>第一，是擴充生產，和適當地增高物價，因為自去年各地豐收，農村經濟較裕後，全國民眾對於國貨的需要量，是日益增大，而國產却有供不應求之勢，加以最近來各種工業原料的紛紛飛漲，貨價均趨增高，此實國貨界漸入佳境的現象，所以，自今年起，我國貨廠商應如何擴充生產量，以廣銷路，和適當地增高貨價，以維成本，這都需要努力實施，與同業間加緊的聯緊來做到。</p>
<p>第二，是製造新的洋貨代替品，近年來入超的數額，雖已漸見减少，但洋貨進口，還很驚人，尤其是一般奢侈物品，去年輸入反見增高，此中原因，一方果由於少數國人對崇拜洋貨心理，尚未肅清，一方却因於有很多的洋貨，尚無國貨代替品，所以，今年起我國貨界應注意廣製新的洋貸代替品，詳細研究，積極仿造，這也是非常主要的工作。</p>
<p>第三，是繼續努力海外市場的開拓，和國貸聯營公司的積極進行，這二點都是我國貨界去年既定的方針，自本年起更應加以努力和完成，因為這是國貨發展前途二個基本的進行路綫。也正是奠定國民經濟建設基礎的唯一前提呵！</p>

<h3>國貨在北平</h3>
<p>— 季元直</p>
<p>“北平”這兩個字在國人的腦海裏皆知道是“國防第一綫”而不知為“私貨一充積所在地吧？誠然：北平西北方的密雲縣，東方的通縣，和正西方的豐台鎭皆在特殊情形之下；而日本軍隊分駐此三地者亦甚多，宋哲元委員長領導下的冀察委員會亦設在此地，所以北平是“國防第一綫”，但是要知道牠也是抵抗極大威脅的英雄市城啊！</p>
<p>雖然如此；究竟牠的四圍情形特殊，與北寗鐵路的政權傍落，給私貨以極大的便利，而這古老的北平亦因此而私貨充拆，到今日竟弄到無處無私貨，無物非私貨了。</p>
<p>吾人常至市場徘徊瀏覽，細心觀察一週，所印入腦中的無非私貸劣貨，如要買一些國貨，若非下極大細心與忍懶，是絕對不能得到的，作者曾買無敵牌牙膏於市場，經十余家始方購到，而賣方亦祇有一只，其他牌子的（社貨）則每家皆有，並且很多，於此可見一班矣。</p>
<p>北平的國貨與洋貨（大半為私貨）的情形既如上述：我們再談談北平的國貨公司及其推銷法；談到北平的國貨公司我們覺得太缺乏了；現在有的祇國貨售品所中原公司（不純賣國貨）並其他一二家，但僅僅三數家，是不能供給全市的，何况售品所與中原公司皆設在王府井大街，售賣的範圍，也只便於東城一隅，其他三隅是不易買到的。國貨的推銷法在北平也是不能與洋貨相比的；不是利率小，就是不得法，不會利用機會，這在本市商人的口中常常可以聽到的，這一點希望全國國貨廠應該特別注意一下纔好。</p>
<p>最後我們談到國貨在北平的銷路；據我想一定不會低於任何地方的，因為北平學生甚多，他們所受的刺激很大，對於國貨亦甚愛好，所以作者寫出北平的國貸情形來，備全國各國貸廠參考，對北平國貨發展情形，應當再三注意，在可能範圍內多設分銷處，改良推銷法，以免北平市的同胞感覺國貨無處購，望洋而興歎。</p>

<h3>推銷淺說（一）</h3>
<p>— 定凱</p>
<p>戲給國貨工廠的當局</p>
<p>引言　創設一家工廠不容易，使工廠的事業臻於穩固，更不容易。製造一種物品不容易，使物品的銷行臻於穩固，更不容易。這兩種環境的造成，必須有適當資金的運用，及適當人才與適當管理的支配。可是還有一個最大的核心，就是“推銷”方面的設計與施行。</p>
<p>這裏我們不去空談什麼理論，應該來討論事實，把關於推銷問題上的種種，分段述出，尚擬就管見所及，對於各國貨工廠的各個推銷方針，加以研究。（例如電器的推銷，搪瓷的推銷，創作者寡聞陋見，不過為熱心國貨所驅使，甚望先進賢達，能予討論與指正，豈僅國貨幸運而已。</p>
<p>（一）推銷的勝利基於心理的分析</p>
<p>在社會各個機構裏去活躍的人，無論那一個，可以說都是一位推銷員，不是推銷一種貨品，便是推銷一種服務；不是推銷一種服務，便是推銷一種主義；他們憑藉着靈敏的手腕，運用着蓮花似的妙⾆，務以相對人的接受為目的，以完成所負使命的成功。</p>
<p>相對人的接受，是推銷者唯一應認識的對象，不論其為“經其商”，“大小批發商”，“門售商”，或迫接售於消費者，都得有各個心理上的應付，或各個適應環境上的應付，推銷難是一個名詞，找們為澈底瞭解其揩成的意義，並簡略地分析其應備具的條件：</p>
<p>（甲）推的方面：</p>
<p>㊀和藹可親的容貌與舉止</p>
<p>㊁強健活潑的體格</p>
<p>㊂言語思想及基本知識的必須條件</p>
<p>㊃所負使命的認識</p>
<p>㊄必理學的認識</p>
<p>（乙）銷的方面：</p>
<p>㊀貨品的精良與美觀</p>
<p>㊁消費人心理的研究</p>
<p>㊂中間商人利益的顧到（包括推銷途徑）</p>
<p>㊃一般風俗人情的研究</p>
<h3>訪問工作的展開</h3>
<p>— 胥松子女士</p>
<p>以嶄新的進步的姿態，出現在國貨運動中的家庭訪問工作，到目前為止，已具有四個月的工作歷程了正當這短短的第一期工作告一段落的時候，却巧值“歲尾年頭”的到來。</p>
<p>民國二十五年終竟是過去了，新的二十六年在帶着無限的希望來臨。作為國貨運動中實際工作者的我們，應如何記取“前事不忘，後事之師一的教訓，把握住過去的經驗，及時努力，將所負的工作展開？</p>
<p>過去的工作收獲在那裏？試從第一期工作加以檢討，除去“訪問工廠”時日不計外，僅就本會——上海市國貨運動聯合會，已發表的實際工作日八十一天的統計看來，被訪問區城，偏重於上中階層人士住宅區的第一二特區西南部一帶，共路綫三十一條：被訪問上中等家庭，合計三千一百九十五戶，若以每戶平均五人計，所受國貨宣傳之深刻印象者，當達一萬五千九百七十五人。</p>
<p>再就上述三千餘家庭主婦對於國貨意見的統計看，認為國貨已日見進步足以代替外貸的佔百分之四十強，尚能應用的佔百分之三十，不能合用或懷欵的估百分之三十弱，我們即可堅决斷言，由於國貨之日漸精進與國人維護國產的努力，誓願服用國貨者已在自分之七十以上即以其他百分之三十以下的人士而言，在我們出示各廠樣品與苦口規勸之下，亦大都表示信任，竟有願加入服用國貸者。</p>
<p>自然，以上海之大，人口眾多，禹余人不過是很小的部份，但以消費力量說來，因多屬上中階層，却佔最大數字，是無疑問的。試想這佔有大量消費力的萬餘人士，今後均能排斥外貨，服用國產，則挽回漏𢨴制止入超的力量，就很驚人了！</p>
<p>因此，訪問工作的進行，雖僅有短短的時日，而它在國貨運動中的重大意義，已不備為國貨界所承認，且得到社會一般人士的贊助，不是偶然的。</p>
<p>現在，第二期工作，已隨歲序而更始，我們又如何進行，以繼續展開所負的重任呢？</p>
<p>㊀訪問中下層區域　誠如黃任之先生所指示“上中階層固為最有消費能力者，但中下層却佔人口比例的大多數，亦不容忽視”。訪問工作既已列入本會本年度工作大綱，今後除繼續進行復訪上中階層區域外，應努力於喚起中下層人士的愛國熱情，便能一致服用國貨之案志可以成城，只有全體的力量，才可以使國貨運動立下深固的根基。</p>
<p>㊁深入學校與社團，除了家庭訪問之外，上海的女子學校及各種的社會團體的訪問工作，也是必需的。因為她們不但擁有廣大的人數，而且正在求知或服務時代，以牠們的智慧與能力，很有搖動社會的力量。我們應得這一工作，立即實行起來。</p>
<p>㊂響應“公務員國貨年”運動，國貨界提議今年為“公務員國貨年”。這意義與苦心是值得讚美的。我認為這一運動在訪問工作上也該響應。那就是說：當我們訪問到公務員的家庭、更應特別懇切陳述自己的希望與聽取他們的意見。那末，“公務員國貨年”才能發揮它的重大意義，在民族自覺與國貨運動上放一異彩！</p>

<h3>樸學大師章太炎名考</h3>
<p>— 楊仁初</p>
<p>晚清三大樸學大師：德清俞曲園，瑞安孫仲容，余杭章先生亦其中之一也。俞孫兩師已早恒化，不幸這樸學界唯一之曙後孤星亦於去年仙逝矣，先生少學於俞大師，治小學極謹嚴，中年後復於佛學有深刻研究，其孜孜不倦，埋頭故籍，日事考證，辨偽，訓詁……之為學精神無不令人仰慕。梁啟超先生曾諛之曰：“在此清學蛻分期與衰落期中，有一人焉能為正統派大張其軍者，曰：餘杭章太炎……所著文始及國故論衡中論文字音韻篇，其精義多乾嘉諸老所未發明，應用正統派之研究法，而廓大其內容，延闢其新徑，實大炎一大成功也。”但不僅至此，章先生並於冶學之外，時發政論，並參與實際活動，確饒有浙東史學派氣息。</p>
<p>考章先生之所以取字“太炎”者，實有其所蘊之深意在焉：先生濟心撲學，其生平所敬仰者，除俞曲園大師外，明末余姚學以濂洛之統，綜會諸家之黃太冲先生與樸學之啟蒙大師顧炎武亦所欽服，因之，章先生取黃太冲之“太”顧炎武之“炎”，拚合連繫之而以“太炎”為宇焉。</p>
<h3>關於地圖的故事</h3>
<p>— 顯微生</p>
<p>做現時代的人民，誰都該熟識本國的地理，小自一鄉·一縣·一省，大而至於全國·全洲·全球，尤其是在國家發生戰事的時候，那“地理”實在再重要也不過的，所以現在學校內，對於那地理一科，也列入主要課目之中，這不在本文話下，姑且不提，下面三則故事，都是實情，讀之，可知“經國者”之對於地理的重視啦！</p>
<p>㊀國父孫中山先生，幼時在香港讀書的時候，他在課上用心研究地理不算數，還在自己的蚊帳頂上，蓋着一面很大的地圖，以便在早上沒有起身以前，和晚間剛睡尚未合眼的兩個時間裏，可以乘閒仰臥而觀看着，真的一覽無遺，當時同學們沒一個不嗤笑他，其實他是很有意思的哪！</p>
<p>㊁歐戰劇烈的時候，德國有個參謀名呌阿泰木，他因為要使得兵士在黑暗的原野中，也能瞧看地圖，於是費了一番心思，竟發明一種用燐質印刷的“夜用地圖，”（其法和夜明表同）發給兵士携帶看，可以在伸手不見五指的戰場上，一目瞭然，無項用燈照着，委實巧妙得狠！</p>
<p>㊂還有一椿，也是在歐戰期內，當時美國有一位馬理哥博士，發明過一種戰地用的麫包，那麫包上面，一個個都印着地圖，使一班兵士在喫的當見，順便可以關心到某處是要隘，某處是不重要，並且携帶很便利，的確也是個好法兒！</p>
<h3>冬天</h3>
<p>— 曹義璇</p>
<p>三種生理的變化</p>
<p>第一，小便為什麼多呢？我們的身體，到了寒冷時候，皮膚裏面的血管就要收縮，血管收縮，那末，皮膚裏血液，多迴行到內臟裏去，這時血液，差不多流到變為尿的腎臟的馬爾比克小體內，因此尿量遂多了。一面因為氣候寒令，汗亦非常减少，其水分也從血管迥行到腎臟，變為小便了。可是尿的分量，究竟有多少呢？普通男子一天在一力得爾至一力得爾半，嚴寒的時候，那就加倍尿量了。第二，手脚為什麼冷呢？手與脚受了寒，那末，四肢全體的血管要收縮，血液的循環也不順，這時腦的血液就多，大凡腦貧血的時候，就會睡眠，所以冬季四肢冷時，腦不會貧血，就不會睡眠的。譬如肚子吃飽了東西，或把手脚溫暖起來，那末，血液集於臟管皮膚，腦變貧血，就會眠了。第三，血管為什麼收縮呢？冬天氣溫低下，從身體表面奪去熱度，可是身體，若不能保持一定的體溫，而身體內又不能無限的放出熱量，於是身體的內部，為貯臟血液起見，使皮膚的血管收縮了。皮膚的血管既然收縮，就是减少暖的血液循環，皮膚表面又受了寒的氣溫刺激，身體當然覺到冷了。</p>
<p>暖房具的利弊</p>
<p>古來有句俗語說：頭冷脚熱，是表示其人身體的健康，可是身體瘦弱的人，年老的人，以及冷性的婦女，那是適相反對的，就是這等人，到了冬天，手足的末梢陰冷，白天不便工作，夜間不能安眠的，大概中產階級以上的人。到了冬天，多使用熱水汀·火爐·等補助溫度·使用火爐，有用電煤炭薪等的區別，熱水汀雖然最為安全，但是需費很大，劣等的電爐，非常危險，若燃燒煤炭薪等，固然可以取熱，一面有炭酸瓦斯放出來，又常使空氣乾燥，在衛生上很有害處，往往發生氣管咽喉病，而且終日在暖房內，忽然跑到屋外，因為內外氣溫的激變，很容易受傷風咳嗽的。所以在暖房內，要少穿衣服，出外時常戴口罩，那就可以調和內外氣溫激變的。</p>
<p>消極的採暖法</p>
<p>我們到了寒天，想保持身體的體溫，用消極的採暖法，最為適宜，就是用“運動”與“摩擦”以助體溫，每天揉練體操，或跑十數分鐘，也可使血脈常常循環，或用乾布摩擦皮膚，也能够增加皮膚的抵抗力，不畏寒冷的，近年來各國提倡“日光浴”，注意在屋外多曝日光，或建築玻璃房取暖，可是在玻璃室內所受的日光，日光中有益身體的紫外光線，透過了玻璃，就要减少效益的。</p>
<h3>新發明的粉質餐品</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>世人常當預料將來定能通行一種壓成藥片式餐品，現在這種餐品，至少已㣲㣲出現了。倫敦某公司辦公室中陳列着三個小瓶，每瓶盛粉質餐品兩盎斯，一瓶足抵烤牛肉片一磅，一瓶足抵萵苣四十根，一瓶足抵菠菜四十顆；還有苺乾，那是幾無份量，用𠱾只須放在水裏，便恢復它的本來重量，滋味，和實質。還有黑色小葡萄乾，晒乾了已近兩年，放在嘴裏，軟嫩而有十足的美味。據科學家說：“這些粉質的餐品。重要的滋養料，都保持不失。有許多用法，一種是加水，成為粉漿，可以夾在面包和餅乾中間同食。”又據台希特拉興有限公司總理阿丹斯氏聲稱：“這個方法，是船長賴凡德氏發明的。他在船上看見許多物品被溫氣損毀，很覺可惜。他在想法兒解决鉛皮被潮濕損壞的問題時，便想到大多數貨物都含有許多舞用的溫氣，以為假使能將這溫氣散失凈盡，可以减少運費不少。後來又在英國博物院中看見陳列著的木乃伊，以為血肉的人體，還能保持數千年而不損毀，那末，其他各樣東西，為什麼不能照樣保持呢？我們能夠儲藏牛羊的芻秣，為什麼不能把牛羊肉也和牛羊所吃的芻秣一樣儲藏起來呢？後來又想出一個把餐品磨放粉質的法兒，一層可以携帶便利，消化容易。二層把果品蔬菜，製成粉質，一年四季，隨時都可以嘗到。還有一層，每種工業，差不多都受濕氣的大累，散失濕氣的問題解决以後，像帽子，皮貨，高爾夫球，烟草人造絲等，每年要少去一筆大損失。粉質的餐品，現在還是試騐品，豫料將來定能受人歡迎。</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>羊湯</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>館子門口又黏上紅紙貼兒—“紅燒羊肉上市，新增美味羊羔”，城裏人天生福氣，什麼季節吃什麼東西，早有人在半邊給預備着，而通知你了，其實在上海，我根本未吃過入味的羊肉，羊肉粥店裏的一白切”，𫒽着甜醬，亦吃不出羊肉滋味，紅烧吧，用炒魚片般的烧法是决不會爛的，不爛，則味同嚼蠟，還有什麼負盛名的“涮羊肉”，味亦平平。</p>
<p>城裏先生吃東西、應應𠱾而已，館子裏怕吃客嫌羊腥氣，煮了再煮，原汁全無了，好像吃羊肉渣。有何磁味？因此我又想起故鄉的“羊湯”來了，雖然八九年沒嚐到，而回味依舊是那麼鮮美的。</p>
<p>重陽過後，鄉間天氣一天冷似一天，尤其在夜裏，九月半邊得穿棉緊身了。這時候鎭上便有人開羊肉店賣羊湯。記得在我們鎭上殺羊的名叫“瘶污龍”，人是髒得不成樣兒，但燒羊肉的手法却稱獨一，老吃客都贊賞。他殺羊的那天，老清早便招攬吃客；“喂，今兒晚上吃羊湯呵，包你鮮得脫眉毛哈哈嘿嘿”……。那時候我年紀小，所以還不把我當主顧，在十七歲那年回去，便亦成為座上客了。</p>
<p>在一個破舊的墻門裏擺上三張八仙桌，十幾條長板櫈，東園裏夜書散場，吃客便哄哄地來了。其中自然還夾雜着賭鬼，烟鬼之流，嗇吝的光喊一碗清羊湯，但碗底也有幾塊光滑骨頭，湯面浮着一些蒜葉，灑上胡椒末，唱進肚，亦煖煖身子。普通喊湯之外，再喊“一蹄一拐”，所謂“蹄”“拐”，就是羊的腿骨和膝骨，上面有一部肉可啃。老頭子沒牙幾是不相宜的。闊綽些的，便合夥搭鍋紅燒，三客燒六百，或四客燒一千。用冰糖燒，肉又爛味道又厚。大家嘴辱吃得油亮亮的。胃口好，錢多，再喊連一鍋。</p>
<p>吃紅燒羊肉的，羊湯奉送。羊湯便是生羊下鍋的原汁，羊熟後，湯中便加鹽和生薑。這在城裏人或者嫌腥氣骯臟，但羊的真味却全在湯中。天冷了，我真想嚐一嚐故鄉的羊湯。</p>

<p>國器正由他臉上移着目光向脚下看去，恰好避開了他的眼光。自己也莫明其妙，不知道是有意閃避的，或者是無意的。只在一剎那之間，兩下就相差過去。等到國器醒悟過來，夢蘭已走得很遠了。這一個說話的機會，已經失掉，第二次會面，就不能再開口。一次順着一次，這樣的下去，就依了以前的規矩，還是每日的老遠盼望着，到了兩下裏相會的時候，却是至多行個注目禮，彼此就走開了。又過了一個多月，已是到了深秋了。有一天，下着細雨，夢蘭撑了一把小傘，西北風由雨絲裏吹透過來，將衣服鬢髮都吹得拂動着，把書包夾得緊紧的，只覺身上冷颼颼的，有些難受，脚按着石板走，也感到有些虛浮不着實。把小伞抗在肩上，自己深深的皺起兩道眉毛，垂了眼皮子，只看着前面的地面上走，後來到了和國器見面的所在，他果然是來了，却見他也是面帶了憂容，也是深鎖了兩道眉毛，穿了雨衣，兩手插在雨衣袋裏，㣲槓了肩䧛綏綏的走着，雖然彼此見面，依舊是行個注目禮，可是他在注目的時候，並不像往常那樣，在眼光裏帶著歡喜親愛的意味，這却是在心裏頭含了什麼悲愁的意思一樣。彷彿走近了，他微微的點了幾下頭，在他點頭的當中，却在那裏告訴人，我心裏不大舒服呢。夢蘭看到他這種形狀，就知道他心裏一定受着刺激，可不知道他為什麼受着剌激，自也不免向他更深切些的注意着。然而國器總是那樣的，只要人家看他，他就低下頭去。而且自己自個女子，决不能先開口向人去問話，所以只是怔了一怔，讓他過去。自己回到家裏，想起國器為人，實在是一位不可多得的老成少年，雖然在文字裏面，還有一些情感過分的字句，可是在每次見面的時候，却十分的鄭重。他若是和平常的人一樣，相識到了相當的日子，總也要開口說說話。那麼，今天他為什麼愁眉不展，在剛才一見面就可以知道了。無如他是一個賦性特殊的人。總不開口。今天看他那一分夏秋的樣子，雖不一定是為自己而發。但是了自己，也不减去憂愁。那或者不能完全無關吧？（一二八）</p>
<p>人物小誌</p>
<h3>無關“外交機密”的往事（下）</h3>
<p>— 張真相</p>
<p>五五三協案發生後，中央大學校長張乃燕曾請徐叔謨去演講；一年後，徐氏任江蘇特派交涉員的時代，張氏又請徐到中大體青館參加總理紀念週，濱講“中國之法權”。在對學生介紹時，張校長曾說：“徐先生為中國數一數二的外交家”。後來張先生離開中大，一度走到外交界，直接和徐先生有過接觸。但當時張乃燕自己固夢想不到會走進外交界，而徐謨也更想不到張乃燕似飛燕一般來又飛燕一般的脫離外交界面去呀！</p>
<p>第二，就談談張乃燕罷！張氏在國外是學化學的，所以後來發明“陰丹士林”顏色，而自己也很喜歡穿一件陰丹士林的長衫，或罩在長袍子的上面。對人常常是一團和氣的。他同時對於歷史文學也喜歡研究。因此也有幾部著作如“世界大戰史”“羅馬史”之類。但是他的性格上缺少“機警”，因為他根本不喜歡什麼機巧變許，他更不耐煩許多繁文縟節。一切外交界裏所認為應有條件，他除了一副儀表，和流利的口才以外，他不願學那些禮節。因此，他在外國常常有一些失禮的地方。大概他的環境太好了。大凡從極優裕的環境出來的人物，往往在學問上尚能有精細獨到的地方，而在世故上，卽是和人事的應付與週旋一方面，總不免留下一些話柄，貽人口實。張乃燕在比利時，有許多不精細留意的地方，外間發生種種傳說。據聞有一次是本想去赴比國總理的盛宴的；他却不留心走到另一位總理那一處去了。這位總理原來是保險公司的總理，一個外國商人，難得有機會遇着國際上賓。張公使看地那樣竭誠招待，晚餐也是富麗豐厚的盛宴，很高興地喝了許多香檳酒。直到果腹歸來，比國總理的盛宴他並非有心爽約，却在無意中走錯了場合，到第二天才發規有誤；但是也無從去道歉了。</p>
<p>外交界常以張公使出比國的事作談資，並不見得張公便話柄太多。實在近十年來外交部內的動態，有許多話不便講，不能講，別人的話柄，將牽涉得罪其他人，所以明知故眛的不講。只有講張公使的話，講的人以為無關“外交機密”，往往另加煊染，說得天花亂墜，彷彿只有張乃燕人是如此。其實，很有些“跳在黃河裏洗不清，”張氏有口也難分辯呀！</p>

<h3>羊肉奇賤</h3>
<p>— 允海</p>
<p>當各種物價正不斷地上漲的時候，突如其來的一個駭人的消息，北平羊肉之價格，反日就低落。法幣一元，可購六斤余，較之往年，幾差一半。”這不能不算是“天下奇聞”畸形現象中的畸形現象。</p>
<p>然而，也許會有人以為這是一種正常的狀態。因為反常了的反常，不就是未反常時的正常嗎？如果我們眞的這樣想，那真是愚蠢之至了。事實决不如此的，凡事都有因果，我們看了果而忘記了去追尋那致果的因，那是只有給事的表面欺騙了，那末，羊肉奇賤的原因在那裏呢？二十日晚報有這樣的一段新聞。——</p>
<p>“綏東各處，接近內地，故開化亦較其他蒙旗為早。但蒙民仍多以遊牧為生，衣食所需，均恃牲畜。故論家室貧富者，恒以牲畜之多寡為斷。自客冬匪偽犯綏，姦淫擄掠，毫無紀律，綏東綏北，適當其衝，蒙民因此十室九空，相率四出避難。所有牲畜，（其中以羊佔最大多數，）因天寒草枯，放牧困難，而携帶飼料，尤不可能。不得已，乃趁鐵路交通之便，陸續運出，沿途出售，以北平為最大尾閭。……”</p>
<p>看了這段新聞，大概總會明白了，歡喜快樂的夢是可以不打自破。結束那新聞的是很沉痛的兩句話：“蒙民忍痛犧牲，無不呌苦云。”相信聽了這兩句話，如果是血肉做成的中國人，大概總不能無動於中的吧。</p>
<p>至於那些以吃狂賤羊肉而快樂的人們，不知會不會想到這些羊肉何以奇賤，以及這羊肉的主人，如今是在怎樣的一個可怕的情景下活着呢？</p>
<h3>陋巷歌聲</h3>
<p>— 渾</p>
<p>說它是陋巷，那是一點也不假的，自己曾經在貧民窟里混過幾年，却沒有夢想到在所謂“十里洋場的上海，還有那末頹毀，污穢，像豬窩一般的陋巷存在着。至於存在的原因，或許和那些一度要拆除的棚戶同樣性质吧？但是它的命運恐怕也要遭到同樣的判决的。</p>
<p>更嚴格一點說，它還不是一條巷，祇是在一片荒地上用竹籬圍起來的幾所破屋而已。有些屋子已經要倒塌下來了，就用一二支木梢扞着那些傾斜的牆壁，在括大風，下大雨的日子，說不定它會突然毀下來壓死幾條人命的。</p>
<p>在竹籬的外面還有更大的一片曠地，垃圾堆，狗屎一切不堪入目的東西充塞着。有成群的孩子還在那里做着沙里淘金的夢，那些孩子自然是陋巷里的小主人了。有時也有變把戲的走江湖，揀</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>了避風的一隅，敲着鑼，吸引走路人圍聚攏來。玩一二套下劣的把戲。</p>
<p>我每天要走過那里，起初很有些不平，同是人類，為什麽在住的一項上有了這末大的區別，而且住在那里的人，又是最能生利的人群，如果消滅了他們，什麼大企業家都祇能對着他們的廠房，大資本發獃。這不平，自然是讀書讀壞了腦筋的書獃子的思想，過後也就遗忘了：因為在書本的外面，不平的事情多得要使你發呆呢。</p>
<p>不過那陋巷里住着一個已經白了頭髪的老漢，始終像鐵一樣烙在我的腦海里。每天晚上，一聽見他的“正月里來是新春：”的歌聲，我的身體底每一部份，就彷彿被什麼尖銳的針刺着似的，或許它竟是很深入的刺進了我的心窝，我幾乎想塞住了我的耳朶，就是終身變了聾子也可以。</p>
<p>那老漢有一個年輕的女孩子扶着，他說是他的孫女兒。那女孩子有一個圆圆的面孔一對聰明的眼睛，她常帮着她的祖父拉住幾個人要唱一個，而常常是勝利的。我巳經是老主顧了，每次是兩枚銅元。我知道另外的那些人，肯施捨幾枚銅元也是為了那個女孩子的使人歡喜，决不是樂意去聽那老漢的，裝着女腔的“孟姜女尋夫”—那樣粗俗的曲子，而又是從一個白了頭髮的老漢唱出來的呢。</p>
<p>他們祖孫倆就那樣每天在附近徘徊，不論風吹雨打，過着艱苦的日子。但是住在陋巷里的人們能度着平靜的日子嗎？那老漢的孫女兒突然患病死了，靠着他的那曲“孟姜女尋夫”是嘶破了喉嚨也沒有人來喚唱的，雖然也有人為他歎息，—然而歎息不是面包！</p>
<p>有一天晚上，那老漢壓着女腔唱過了正月就停止了。那是一個下着細雨的晚上，在這荒僻的，都市的角落里是很少有走路人的，誰知道他是耐不住寒冷，還是餓癟了肚子，暈到在街頭了。等到外面有人吵鬧着的時候已在两個鐘頭之後了，是陋巷里和那老漢同居的一個工人夜工回家時發现了的。</p>
<p>現在憫憐對於他已沒有用處了，當時由眾人施佈的一些錢却正好做了他第一天的棺木費。</p>
<p>人，果然是應該有活着的時候做些事情，也終有死去的一天的，但是那個老漢在活着的時候做了些什麽呢？或許他在年青的時候已經盡了他最大的力了！這個我們是無法知道的。他現在却祇是個賣唱者，那樣地死去也不是最非簿的了。那末，為什麼到現在他的影子在我腦海里深深地遺留着呢？我不能自己回答，大概又是读書讀壞了我的脑筋，我希望能忘去那些不必要的印象，而自己多做一點事情，在我死去的前。</p>
<h3>賭錢</h3>
<p>— 惠波</p>
<p>天攏出個陰沉沉的面孔，不久便飘起大地的雪花了。</p>
<p>莊稼老婆最怕下雪，丈夫沒事做就去賭錢。其實輸了個一千八百錢在從前，本沒關係，自己多打兩個黃昏，紡他二斤棉花又撈了回來。但是現在不成了，一斗糧漲了三斗的價錢，沒辦法。况且年輕人沒有主張，劉桂家的雖然老了，但是小金也滿十六歲了。小妮子那樣的妖艷，做那手生意又是祖傳的本領。聽說王局長給睡了一夜；賞二十塊大洋還不住口的誇她懂事。自己可不能讓丈夫也給迷了去。</p>
<p>“冷不冷？風緊得很啊！”李成老婆給牛送一次草，回來攢到丈夫的懷裏笑着問。</p>
<p>“別浪了，我知道，你又怕我……”</p>
<p>“那麼為啥把好好的錢丟到那浪淫窠子裏呢？不賭錢就……”</p>
<p>她學着當閨女時的口吻，想駡丈夫兩句，然而她沒駡出來。</p>
<p>第二天，李成在屋裏轉動着。老婆特別的給生了些火，燃一堆谷糠，柏枝。一縷縷的白烟散了，老婆在對他發着謎人的微笑！</p>
<p>“鳥鷄巴！𠤤是個浪貨”。他睬也不睬的在心中駡了一句。馬上一種聲音傳來，像是骨牌，像是骰子，又像打紙牌時馬二爺的啞喉嚨聲。</p>
<p>“唔！”他看見馬二爺把一張六萬打了單釣四萬。糟糕，好好的牌怎麼這樣的弄，他連忙去制止他。</p>
<p>白烟氣仍在旋轉着，散開來又一幅怪可愛的笑彌彌的臉。他看清是小金，两隻眼皮裹着水樣含情的眼珠向自己看着，他感觉小孩子害着般的不好意思。</p>
<p>“什麽？”老婆驚駭的看着他。</p>
<p>他驚覺過來，把旱烟袋從嘴裏取下：沒講話，溜達溜達的走了出去。</p>
<p>沙沙的清脆的雪聲送着他的脚步，一刻鐘𢓭他走進了阿桂家裏。</p>
<p>“快喲！給你李大哥搬櫈子坐。”阿桂家的嘴唇抹得猴屁骨一般紅，眼笑得沒有縫。</p>
<p>小金笑搭着遞個方櫈，一隻鐵爐發着熊熊的火熖，𡔳裏的水在翻着熱氣！一切都是溫暖的。他看着小金，比從前更標緻得多了。</p>
<p>“李成準定是怕老婆，門也不敢出了！”</p>
<p>阿桂家的笑了起來：打牌的人也笑了起來；小金笑得更厲害，俯在媽媽的懷裏。</p>
<p>“不怕！你今天敢來賭牌，一張狗娃得意的嚷着。</p>
<p>“李大哥！只管給來一場，看嫂嫂會怎樣你。”小金拉着他一隻手。</p>
<p>“不！我來不成麻將。”他不好意思的辯駁着。</p>
<p>“我給你看着，——去！”</p>
<p>“別理會，說他怕就是怕！”</p>
<p>“小金，別給他灌米湯了，翻正他不敢來！”張狗娃給小金打着俏皮。</p>
<p>“灌你媽那×，要是你妹妹天天給你灌的……”</p>
<p>“哈，哈……哈！……”屋子裏的人全笑了起來。</p>
<p>“喂，打這一張。”小金謎人的眼睛向他看着，紅潤的小手在掉着不能放在一起的牌到外邊去。</p>
<p>牌在嚮着，打着。小金頭上散發着清香的氣息，眼睛，在動着特別的表情。</p>
<p>夜裏，回到家中，妻躺在懷裏像隻羔羊，他懺悔了！恨自己不該去賭錢，痛惜着輸去的十一吊錢！但天明时，他又在踱着圈子，暗駡着老婆。想着小金的笑臉，她身上迷人香氣；偷偷的趁老婆不在又溜了出去。</p>
<p>“喂！打這一張！”小金給他斜着迷人的眼睛，用紅潤的手給掉着牌。</p>
<p>在阿桂家裏，馬二爺，張狗娃，他們又開始賭錢了！</p>
<h3>牆</h3>
<p>— 申冰</p>
<p>牆以一個殉難者的忠誠，兀自巡行於家屋的四周，從白天到黑夜，又從黑夜到白天。牆忍受着冷冽的西北風，忍受着孩子們塗在它身上的木炭的畫筆；但它是高傲的，攔住了行路的人，攔住了經過的車輛，也攔住了往屋裏窺視的貪婪的眼波。</p>
<p>白天，陽光逗留在牆根下，西北風不再抓着它的胸。人們便借着牆的晴风地帶，坐在陽光下。冬天的影子微笑在古舊的棕金色的袍子上，在翻開着的書本上，在老人們額間的皺痕上。孩子们的陀螺便在牆根下的方寸地上旋轉着，旋到了牆腳下，陀螺像醉倒的人那麼地跌交了。傍晚，牆上的陽光漸漸地斂回去。</p>
<p>黑夜，老人發出絮聒而無謂的㣲噓。牆完全為黑暗所籠罩着。西北風用銳利的爪抓着它的胸，發出嗽嗽聲響來。牆以一個殉難者的忠誠守衛着睡着的人家，跟着沒有好意的夜行人格鬥，终於它渾身鮮血淋漓，被撕碎了胸膛。</p>
<p>牆睥睨着－切，因為它兀自巡行行於家屋的四周，堅勇而高傲。</p>

<h3>業餘劇人第二個節目「大雷雨」今日公演</h3>
<p>業餘劇人恊會第三次公演，開始以來，業已三天，第一個節目是世界文豪托爾斯太之「慾魔」，雖則連日霪雨，但賣座之盛，超過了歷來戲劇公演之紀錄。兹以各影片公司工作之緊張以及戲院之合同關係，每個戲只决定演三天，决不展期。第二個節目「大雷雨」，决於今日起公演，這個劇本是奥斯托洛夫斯基的名作，歷屆在蘇聯戲劇節上演之名劇，業已譯成七十多國譯本，在世界文學上佔有極重要之地位。蘇聯且已攝製成電影。此劇兹由業餘劇人上演，由章泯先生導演，趙丹，鄭君里，藍蘋，舒繡文，等諸大演員恊力演出，冼星海先生担任全劇音樂配奏，全劇四景，費用逾千餘元，伏　伽河畔之風光以及俄國之情調，能在中國舞台上出現的，當屬創舉。</p>
<p>此劇也只演三天，三天後，即將上演沈苓宋之的導演之「醉生夢死」，在上海之演期只九天，决不延期，愛好戲劇之各界，幸勿失之交臂。</p>
<h3>聯華攝影場花絮</h3>
<p>「天作之合」中，韓蘭根之噱頭特多，尤以在此寒風凛冽之時拍攝炎夏之景，當氣温降低在三十歳度之下，韓赤體露宿在窮人街上，手揮蒲扇，嘴裏還連説熱啦！熱啦！</p>
<p>「天作之合」裏韓蘭根在有職業時養鷄，每日産卵甚多，及至失業，待鷄産卵佐餐，而鷄竟會對之摇頭，其愛犬也當他熟睡之時騷擾不已，他以爲世態炎凉，鷄犬也會揶揄他。</p>
<p>「春到人間」在杭州拍戲，孫瑜率領各工作人員由湖濱至靈隱作短程賽跑，其成績出人意外。第一，劉繼羣；第二，孫瑜；第三，陳燕燕。殿軍爲韓蘭根。</p>
<p>賀孟斧導演之「將軍之女」，有將軍閲兵一幕，受檢士兵萬餘人，恒勵將軍正在揚眉捋鬚之際，忽檢閲台上一彈飛來，立時爆炸，黎灼灼嚇得面無人色，遍覓將軍不知所在。</p>
<p>「將軍之女」中的梅琳，是將軍老僕之女，一個淸白的女兒，因受不住將軍的壓廹而被摧殘。梅琳之飾此角，恰合一淸白女兒身分。</p>
<p>「十字街頭」中</p>
<p>橱窓佈置員吕班的表情</p>
<h3>狗眼看人低</h3>
<p>狗眼看人低，這句話原來確實是指狗的，可是現在，人，有的做狗的人，真也像狗一樣了！</p>
<p>葛福榮和翁世榮，在天一新片「富貴榮華」裏，原是兩個養狗的僕人，所以他們的賬房先生是看他們不起的。但有一天，他們居然中了航空奬劵頭奬，他們到主人處去兑現，主人開了一張十萬元的條子，到賬房先生那裏去取錢，賬房先生不但不給錢，反而侮辱他們，後來，由主人的電話證明了是事實，於是又百般的恭維他們，這就呌做「狗眼看人低」！</p>
<h3>「日出」將上演</h3>
<p>一九三七年，也許可以説是戲劇年吧！因爲在開始的時候，特别使我們注意的是戲劇界的活耀，大小劇社的組織和不斷的公演。這現象不但是上海以前未曾有過，就是在中國的劇運史上，也没有這樣的興起過。</p>
<p>最近「戲劇工作社」的「日出」也將要上演快了。這劇本的作者曹禺，是最近中國傑出的劇作家，他第一次的創作「雷雨」直到現在還受着許多觀衆熱烈的愛護。這第二傑作「日出」，在導演者歐陽予倩的指導之下，「戲劇工作社」全體人員辛苦努力下排演完成了。現在據可靠消息，「日出」的公演期，大致可以在二月初實現了，公演的地點則在卡爾登大戲院。</p>
<p>記得作家茅盾先生説過：「日出」是當前劇壇的大收穫，祇希望它快快上演，早些和社會相見。那麽這一個消息，當然是值得大家欣喜的了。</p>
<p>「日出」是比「雷雨」更爲刺激深刻動人的劇本，加以「戲劇工作社」優秀的演出，在舞台上的成就，是可以保證的。</p>
<h3>藝華碎錦</h3>
<p>朱秋痕繼「彈性女兒」完成後，藝華因朱成績頗佳，决擬聘請爲基本演員，在潘孑農手編之「花開花落」中担任主角之一。</p>
<p>佔據整個攝影塲的新都會舞廳，佈置得富麗堂皇，睥睨影壇，並商請最大舞廳之音樂隊參加奏演，同時由「彈性女兒」全體要角共同演出，祗此數幕的偉大塲面，已化費在三千元以上，「彈性女兒」的製成，亦是一部不容忽視的鉅片。</p>
<p>藝華之「並蒂蓮」一劇，爲叙述青年智識階級的贊成自由戀愛，反對舊式婚姻，內容寫得十分生動，該片開拍以來，已完成不少矣。</p>
<p>女童星牟菱與具有滑稽天才的童星王子淸在方沛霖導演之「滿園春色」中共同演出，頗爲防方哥贊許，譽爲有希望的小天使。</p>

<h3>海外汽車新訊</h3>
<p>— 愚</p>
<p>製造汽車用鋼數量　鋼料為汽車製造上之主要原料。據美國米西根大湖鋼鐵公司總工程師克勞士之估計。一九三七年汽車上所用之鋼鐵。其數量將為六，○○○，○○○噸。至汽車之數量則估計為四，五○○，○○○輛，汽車上使用鋼鐵之處。在一九三七年之新車上。將比數從前為多。若干製造廠已决定車頂等處完全用鋼，俾於安全上得獲最大之成功。車身方面向用鋼鐵木料各半者。現亦决改用純鋼。即此一端已能令用鋼之數量激增也。據統計美國之年入為四○，○○○，○○○，○○○元。其中之百分之一，四乃用以購買汽車者。當收入為八○，○○○，○○○，○○○元，則購買汽車之消耗為百分之四，一。通用公司副總即威爾遜在最近舉行之鋼鐵工程年會席上稱。此項增加乃因汽車出品之價值高增所致。汽車製造已竭其全力於汽車出品之精益求精。而於價格方面則力求其低廉。底特羅為世界汽車製造業之中心。同時亦為全世界用鋼數量最鉅之城市。鋼鐵消耗量與汽車製造之關係。於此可見一斑矣。</p>
<p>▲一九三七型惠萊士　惠萊士哇浮蘭公司之新型汽車不久即可登場。其詳細情形雖尚未披露。但據悉此項新軍之售價大約為美金百元左右。車之製作完全係標準化。寬闊高度悉稱是。每加侖汽油約可走三十五英里。每滑油一瓜得駛一千二百英里。又據該公司總理威爾遜氏稱。銷售商方面業已定貨五○，○○○輛云。</p>

<h3>The Shaanxi Situation Shows Signs of Improvement</h3>
<p>Xi'an Shows Signs of Repentance; National Army to Be Stationed in Tongguan and West Areas; Settlement Method to Be Decided by the Third Plenary Session</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] The Shaanxi situation has taken a sharp turn for the better. The settlement method will be decided by the Third Plenary Session. The Shaanxi affair is temporarily coming to an end. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Luoyang] After Mi Chunlin and others arrived in Tongguan, it is reported that Xi'an has shown signs of repentance. The future is promising. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] The Central Army will be stationed at various stations along the Longhai Railway west of Tongguan to monitor Zhang and Yang's troops. The Shaanxi-Gansu communists will still be thoroughly suppressed. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It is reported that Mi Chunlin and Xie Ke returned to Xi'an after visiting Gu in Luoyang. If Yang shows signs of repentance, it is expected that they will come to Nanjing again. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: According to the situation in recent days, the overall situation seems to be improving, and the future looks promising. Xi'an originally intended to carve out the Northwest as a rebel base, but the recent situation is extremely unfavorable. Yu Xuezhong is unwilling to join the rebellion and refuses to offer advice to Xi'an. Yang Hucheng is unable to command his subordinates, and most of Zhang's generals have the intention of returning to the government. Therefore, they feel that their power is exhausted, and they fear that the Central Army will order the suppression of the rebellion. They seem to have the intention of repenting. Mi Chunlin and Xie Ke arrived in Tongguan the other day and reported to Director Gu that Xi'an has shown signs of repentance. According to general observation, the situation seems to be improving. A reporter went to the front line of Huaxian County on the 25th and stayed overnight, and returned to Tongguan by military vehicle on the 26th. The road was rugged. Along the way, I saw that the National Army was disciplined and did not commit the slightest offense. The people were living as usual and were as peaceful as ever. In the villages and towns I passed, spring couplets supporting the leader were posted everywhere. Among them, there was a couplet with the words "The Central Government is a wise ruler," which shows how deeply the central government's virtue has influenced the people of Shaanxi. It is also said that the two sides in the front are guarding the Chishui River, with trenches facing each other, only three to five li apart. According to the responsible generals on the front line, the rebel bandits occasionally provoke, but the National Army obeys orders and only lies in ambush in the trenches, without firing a shot. However, sometimes the people in various villages and towns hate the rebel army's raping, looting, and lack of discipline, and often organize crowds to attack the rebel army's positions at night. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Regarding the settlement of the Shaanxi situation, the central government has repeatedly urged Yang Hucheng and others to thoroughly realize their mistakes. Yang and others have colluded with the communist bandits to resist orders, which has become increasingly apparent. Petitions from all walks of life across the country requesting a punitive expedition have been pouring in like snowflakes. Now it is reported that the central government cherishes national strength and is still showing the utmost tolerance towards Yang and others. If Yang and others are willing to be enemies of the people, the central government will have no choice but to endure the pain and quell the rebellion in order to rectify discipline and safeguard unity. It is reported that the situation in Shaanxi Province is extremely complex. Communist bandit leaders such as Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Peng Dehuai, Xu Xiangqian, and Xu Haidong are all in Xi'an. The communist troops are in Bao'an, Fushi, Yanchang, Sanyuan, and Pucheng. The communist troops and the troops of Yang and Yu suspect each other. People from all walks of life in Shaanxi and Gansu believe that Yang Hucheng and others have been bewitched by the bandits, which will inevitably lead to the suffering of the people. They have elected representatives to detour to Tongguan and ask the central government to save the people of Shaanxi from fire and water. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Wu Songlin said that Han also hopes for a peaceful resolution of the Shaanxi situation. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Various places have sent telegrams to the central government for days, requesting a punitive expedition against Yang's rebellion. The Central Party Headquarters received many such documents on the 26th, including the Chinese Cultural Construction Association and its branches in various provinces and cities, and more than 300 groups of farmers, workers, merchants, students, and women in Hankou, as well as the Zhejiang Provincial Farmers' Association, various groups in Yiliang County, Yunnan, the Tongshan County Chamber of Commerce, the Ningxia Provincial Farmers' Association, the Business Federation, the Educational Association, and various county mass organizations, and the Qinghai Provincial Mongolian and Tibetan Cultural Promotion Association, and other organizations. The wording was extremely sincere. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Xuzhou] The Tongshan Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the central government, requesting a clear order to punish Yang Hucheng and requesting Jiang to return to Nanjing to preside over the government and sweep away the rebels. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The chief prosecutor of the Xi'an Local Court, who had escaped danger, arrived in Nanjing and reported the recent judicial situation in Xi'an to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Judicial Administration on the 26th. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] According to reliable sources, Yang of Shaanxi has indeed repented and is currently looking for ways to ensure the safety of himself and his subordinates. This is definitely in progress and will be revealed in the next few days. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] In addition to sending representatives to Bing to visit Yan, Wan Fulin sent Er Heyan, a member of his staff, to Bing yesterday. Yan hosted a banquet for Xiao and Deng Shishan's representative Xu Fanting at the Sui Office tonight. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zheng-Shaanxi Telegraph and Remittance Services Have Resumed</h3>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Zheng-Shaanxi telegraph and bank remittance services resumed on the 26th. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: Telegrams between Xi'an and Zhengzhou have been restored and are flowing smoothly. (26th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>[Tianjin] Regarding the Japanese investment in the Longyan Iron Mine, Lu Zongyu came to Tianjin from Ping on the 26th to contact Sakatani, the director of the South Manchuria Railway Company's Industry Department. The Japanese side has not yet made a decision on this matter. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Nonaka Tokio, the head of the research section of the South Manchuria Railway Company's Tianjin office, said that the joint meeting on the development of the economy of North China, convened by the South Manchuria Railway Company's resident army department and consulate in Tianjin, was due to a plan made by both China and Japan last year. There were budgets for one Tanggu port construction, two Longyan iron mines, and three Tianjin-Shijiazhuang railways. Although the Hebei-Chahar authorities agreed to assist in the implementation, there were many difficulties. Moreover, due to the excessive number of budgets, the opinions of the military department and the South Manchuria Railway Company were not entirely consistent. This meeting will thoroughly discuss, re-estimate the budget, and ask the military department to relay to the Hebei-Chahar authorities to sincerely cooperate, and then select the easy ones to implement step by step. Also, the officials attending the railway company are scheduled to go to Ping on the 27th for investigation, and then return to Dalian. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Today, the authorities of China and Japan convened a meeting here to discuss the plan for the economic development of North China. It is reported that several Japanese experts from the Dalian South Manchuria Railway Company also participated in the discussions. The main meeting was held this afternoon, with Song Zheyuan, the chairman of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, visiting Tashiro, the commander of the Japanese North China Garrison, to exchange views on various issues. This morning, the Japanese experts from the South Manchuria Railway Company in Dalian and the Japanese military authorities had a preliminary discussion at the Japanese military headquarters.

<h3>Senior Official of the Japanese Army Ministry, Hashimoto, Comes to China with a Mission</h3>
<p>Visits Factions of Young Japanese Military Officers in North China; Solicits the Military Ministry's Recommendation for the Army Minister's Attitude</p>
<p>[Tianjin] Colonel Hashimoto of the Japanese Army Ministry, the leader of the Japanese Youth Party, came to North China on the morning of the 26th to visit the group of young military officers Hashimoto, Iida, Wada, Ikeda, etc., to solicit their opinions on the current coup d'état for the Udan Cabinet, and the attitude of the military department in refusing to recommend the Army Minister.

Now in the Japanese coup, the military department has decided to try to eliminate the forces of various established parties, so that under the Emperor, a one-party, one-faction based on the Youth Party can be formed, and the inherent power of the imperial army can be exerted. The Udagawa Cabinet had obtained the understanding of the navy side in advance. He secretly compromised, ignoring the opinions of the young faction on the army side, so he has always advocated refusing to recommend the Army Minister. Also, Hashimoto intends to stay in Tianjin for a week and go to Ping at the beginning of next month before transferring to Chang. (26th Dispatch)</p>

Now a summary of the Tour's budget has been prepared for review and approval. The resolution was passed, the Tour will be held on April 5th, and the Yuan will issue an order to all highways to make full use of and protect them carefully. 3) Minister Zhang of the Ministry of Railways reported that the Board of Directors of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway United Company reported that the section of the railway from Hangzhou to Yushan is currently being replaced with heavy rails and bridges are being rebuilt in order to facilitate direct traffic between Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guangdong. The necessary improvement costs have been separately contracted with the Czech merchant Weirun Huici Steel Factory and the China Bank of Hangzhou for advance loans. They are requested to review and approve the record. The resolution was passed and sent to the Central Political Committee for record. 4) Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education reported that since the Shaanxi-Gansu incident occurred, students from these provinces studying abroad have been requesting relief due to a lack of tuition.

<p>[Hong Kong] The Guangdong People's Food Association allocated 37,000 dan of rice from Wuhu to 12 rice shops to sell at a subsidized price of 8 jin and 10 liang per yuan on the 26th. Poor people rushed to buy it, and they could not keep up. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Kong Finance on the 26th, begging for a full exemption of import tax on foreign rice in Guangdong to relieve the urgent need. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It has been found that the Guangdong-Hankou Railway Bureau has been actively planning to transport Hunan rice to Guangdong and has been transporting it as much as possible. In December of last year, four special trains were organized and operated for round-trip transportation. Later, due to the construction work between Chenzhou and Lechang, it was stipulated that trains could not pass from 2:00 p.m. every day to 6:00 a.m. the next morning. Not long after, military transportation became frequent again, making it very difficult for special Hunan rice trains to run. However, the railway still has to designate eight freight cars every day for loading. Now the 4.8.4 cars between Chenzhou and Lechang can pass. When the rice famine occurred in Guangdong Province, the railway received a telegram from the Ministry of Railways, instructing it to prepare a special rice transport train and transport as much as possible to emphasize the people's food and regulate the market. It is now reported that the railway has formulated four measures for transporting Hunan rice to Guangdong: 1. A direct-responsible rice transport special train, one or two, will be added from Changsha to Guangzhou every day. 2. The tarpaulin cars required for this rice transport special train will be selected by the Changsha Traffic Director. Once assigned, they must not be dismantled or transferred for other uses without the special approval of the transportation director. The transportation section chiefs and each traffic director are responsible for effectively supervising the implementation. 3. When this rice transport special train returns, only Guangdong salt and goods directly to stations north of Changsha are allowed to be loaded, and goods from other stations are not loaded at all. 4.

<h3>The Increasing Crisis of Smuggling in North China</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The seriousness of the smuggling crisis in North China has recently attracted attention from various parties once again. This is not accidental. As the military aggression in Suiyuan seems to be easing, this economic aggression has come to the forefront. At the same time, as our domestic problems are gradually being resolved, the general public is focusing more on foreign issues. According to recent news from Tianjin, smuggled goods from a certain party are once again entering in massive quantities. According to the report of Sir Frederick Maze, the Inspector General of Customs, the loss of North China customs revenue due to smuggling in 1936 reached a staggering 50 million yuan. Such alarming news cannot be ignored by anyone.</p>
<p>Organized smuggling in North China began in the summer of 1935 and reached its peak in mid-May of last year. Since then, after our country's strict crackdown and prevention efforts, it has been relatively reduced. However, this planned and organized economic aggression is closely linked to the aggressor's military and political power. Its continuation and expansion have not been fundamentally curbed. An article by Hansen was published in the December issue of the Pacific Affairs journal, under the title "Smugglers, Soldiers, and Diplomats." It stated that the smuggling activities in North China, jointly launched by these figures, have destroyed 150 miles of our country's northern tariff barrier, rushing in thousands of tons of white sugar, countless miles of cotton cloth, rayon raw materials sufficient for the manufacture of millions of pairs of silk stockings, and cigarette paper that can choke every male and female child in China. These smuggled goods are loaded from Dalian, with a fleet of ten to thirty steamships, crossing the Gulf of Zhili, and going down along Beidaihe, openly guaranteed by military force and secretly protected by diplomacy. Therefore, they can move with great momentum and are unstoppable. They use the puppet autonomous region of eastern Hebei as a base, from which they spread throughout North China and the Yangtze River basin. This situation has not only become a malignant tumor that undermines our country's finances and industry but has also dealt a major blow to the normal trade of other countries and the guarantees for loans. According to the report of Sir Frederick Maze, kerosene accounts for a considerable portion of the smuggled goods. This is a very significant blow to the British, American, and Soviet kerosene trading firms. At the same time, the customs revenue of Qinhuangdao and Tianjin decreased by 30% compared to previous years, which has had a considerable impact on the loans guaranteed by customs duties from Britain, the United States, and other countries.</p>
<p>The prevention of smuggling activities has always focused on railway inspections. However, armed smugglers are using automobiles to reach the interior directly via highways, making it difficult to implement appropriate measures. Of course, we clearly recognize the root cause of this malignant tumor. Its root lies in the deepening of the aggressor's political and military power. The most concrete example is the existence of the puppet autonomous region of eastern Hebei and the control of the Great Wall passes by others. Amidst the recent resurgence of the smuggling crisis in North China, we should actively pay attention to these fundamental issues. In the resistance against Suiyuan, our side has gained a clear advantage. At present, we should also take decisive steps to completely eliminate this economic aggression.</p>
<h3>American Flood Displaces 600,000 People</h3>
<p>Fears of Epidemics Following the Great Flood; Troops Deployed to Assist in Relief Efforts</p>
<p>[Washington] As a result of the flood, the death toll has reached eighty, and the number of displaced people has reached 500,000. The waters of various tributaries continue to flow into the Mississippi River, so the water level of the river south of Memphis, Tennessee, is expected to rise significantly. It is believed that the water level of the Ohio River in Cincinnati will soon reach 80 feet, which will be 30 feet higher than the flood stage. Many cities are about to experience epidemics, famine, and a shortage of drinking water. The army, navy, and other government agencies are continuing to send people to the disaster areas to carry out relief efforts. Thousands of people are still trapped in their homes or gathered in temporary shelters, relying on these shelters for relief from the cold, hunger, and disease. According to a White House announcement today, the authorities will ask Congress to approve disaster relief funds. The Red Cross is also appealing to all parties to raise four million US dollars for emergency relief. In Ripley, Tennessee, a house where refugees were taking shelter on the roof collapsed, causing fourteen people to fall into the water and drown. In Libanto, Arkansas, a small boat rescuing refugees capsized, drowning three women and three children. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

However, the river waters continue to rise. In the eleven states affected by the disaster, 49 people have died. In addition to 749 nurses and 40,000 Works Progress Administration employees, countless volunteers, army soldiers, tax police, and national guard members are working in the disaster area. The cities most severely affected by the disaster are Cincinnati and Louisville. The water level of the Ohio River in both places will likely reach 80 feet. Cincinnati officials say that the city only has three days' worth of drinking water, and there have been fires. Louisville's sewers are still backing up, and there is a risk of epidemics among the 200,000 homeless residents. (25th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Washington] The raging waters of the various tributaries are still flowing into the Mississippi River. Colonel Leport, the chief engineer for the Memphis district in Tennessee, predicted today that an unprecedented flood is currently developing.

Today, a cargo ship full of refugees capsized on Badoh Avenue in Cantocki, Kentucky, drowning fourteen people. Therefore, the death toll from the flood has now increased to 94.

<p>[Washington] The House Appropriations Committee today passed the government's proposed supplementary budget bill of 790 million yuan to relieve unemployment until June 30 of this year. There was much debate in the House about whether to increase the amount of the appropriation in the bill to include disaster relief funds. However, Harry Hopkins, the director of the Works Progress Administration, has the authority to use all or part of the funds for disaster relief. Congressional representatives from the disaster areas have decided to request an additional 10 million yuan for disaster relief and reconstruction. (25th National Dispatch)</p>
<h3>United Naval Administration in the United States</h3>
<p>The President Advocates Establishing a Adjustment Mechanism Directly Under the Secretary of the Navy</p>
<p>[Washington] It was learned here today that the opinions of senior officers and section chiefs of the US Navy often conflict, so there are discussions about reorganization. It is said that President Roosevelt is also deeply dissatisfied with the organization of the Navy Department because the Secretary of the Navy does not directly control the department's administration and relies entirely on the section chiefs. The Secretary of Navy is merely signing documents, so the President supports the establishment of an adjustment mechanism that reports directly to the Secretary of Navy. The reason for the conflict in opinions is said to be the issue of changing promotion policies. (25th National Dispatch)</p>

<p>Terms Not Yet Agreed Upon</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources, officials from the British and French Ministries of Finance are currently in London to discuss the conditions for the proposed British loan to France. It is reported that the loan will be short-term. The current negotiations are focused on the loan period (one year or nine months), the total amount, and the collateral. Estimates for the total amount of the loan range from 40 million pounds to 50 million pounds. It is said that if the British side only provides 40 million pounds, the remaining amount may be borrowed from the Netherlands and Switzerland. At the same time, it is reported that the French side has not conducted any loan negotiations with the United States. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Contents of the US-Japan Cotton Industry Provisional Agreement</h3>
<p>Osaka. Japanese and American cotton industry representatives have been negotiating a provisional agreement on the Japanese and American cotton industries since the 22nd. It was officially established on the evening of the 24th. It is reported that its contents are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The total export volume of Japanese cotton cloth in 1937 is set at 155 million yards, and in 1938 at 100 million yards. (2) One-quarter of the total number of cotton cloth exports in 1938 (25 million yards) can be carried over to 1937 if Japan does not implement a rapid increase in exports to the United States. (3) The export volume of cotton cloth in 1938 has implications for future exports, while the export volume in 1937 has implications for cotton cloth exports contracted before the establishment of the US-Japan provisional agreement on January 21, 1937. Parts contracted after January 21 are not included. (4) Cotton cloth exports to the United States include cotton products such as towels, tablecloths, and bedsheets. (26th Allied Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Basis for Anglo-American Reciprocal Trade Agreement Negotiation Agreed Upon</h3>
<p>British Trade Minister Runciman Meets with US Authorities, Exchanges Views on Raw Material Supply and Demand</p>
<p>[Washington] British Trade Minister Runciman, when meeting with journalists at the British Embassy today, stated that a basis for negotiations regarding a reciprocal trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the United States had been nearly agreed upon in principle with President Roosevelt. The talks between the two sides had made great progress, but at present, only very broad points were being discussed. The details would have to await formal negotiations between representatives of the two governments. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull announced today that talks between the United Kingdom and the United States have, in principle, agreed to proceed with negotiations for a reciprocal trade agreement. At the same time, Treasury officials and the well-known currency expert, former Treasury advisor Professor Sprague, also met secretly to discuss the issue of currency stabilization. This issue was raised due to talks between British Trade Minister Runciman and US authorities. Hull stated that further discussions would soon determine the specific conditions for negotiating the trade agreement. It is understood that President Roosevelt and Runciman also discussed issues such as whether a disarmament agreement could be concluded if peace were to be achieved in Europe. At the same time, the United Kingdom also wants to ascertain whether the United States' neutrality policy will cut off the raw materials needed by the United Kingdom in times of war. Those responsible believe that the United Kingdom has warned the United States that if the United States maintains a policy of prohibiting exports to belligerent countries, the United Kingdom may deprive the United States of its leading position in its markets.

<h3>Danzig Issue</h3>
<p>British and Polish Foreign Ministers Reach a Basis for Compromise</p>
<p>[Geneva] British Foreign Secretary Eden, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, and the leader of the National Socialist Party of the Danzig Senate, Mr. Greiser, held a meeting here last night and reached a basis for compromise on the Danzig issue.

<h3>Former Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee Arrested</h3>
<p>News from Paris</p>
<p>[Paris] It is rumored that the former Chairman of the Soviet People's Committee, Rykov (who succeeded Lenin as Chairman of the People's Committee), has recently been arrested. Regarding this matter, the Times has just published a dispatch from its Moscow correspondent stating, "As is customary, Soviet official circles neither confirm nor deny this claim." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Conditions for Resolving the Franco-Turkish Dispute</h3>
<p>The Language Issue Remains Unresolved</p>
<p>[Geneva] Regarding the issue of the Turkish minority in the two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch in Syria, France and Turkey have, in effect, reached an agreement. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The two cities of Alexandretta and Antioch nominally express loyalty to Turkey, but in practice become an administratively independent autonomous unit, governed by a French high commissioner appointed by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>㊁ The territorial integrity of the two cities should be jointly guaranteed by the League of Nations and France and Turkey. The currency and postal and telecommunications systems of the two cities remain the same as in other parts of Syria.</p>
<p>㊂ The border of Syria should be jointly agreed upon and guaranteed by Turkey and Syria.</p>
<p>Currently, the language issue remains unresolved. Turkey requires that only Turkish be used as the official language in the two cities, which France considers inconvenient to comply with. It is generally believed that the full text of the agreement on the two cities issue will be drafted by a special expert committee after the end of the current session of the Administrative Council. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[Geneva] Negotiations between France and Turkey today encountered obstacles due to the language issue. According to the Turkish representative speaking to a reporter from this agency, France and Turkey have reached agreement on all points except for the language issue, but the result has been a breakdown. Turkey demands that Turkish be the official language of the Alexandretta region, and agrees to accept the regulations of the League of Nations Administrative Council, recognizing Arabic or other languages. However, the French representatives did not agree with this view. (Reuters, 26th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Refuses to Join the Cabinet</h3>
<p>All Three Candidates Recommended for Army Minister Decline</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The meeting of the three chiefs of the army was held at the Army Minister's official residence at 4:30 PM today. Chief of the General Staff Prince Kan'in, Army Minister Terauchi, Director-General of Education Sugiyama, Vice Chief of the General Staff Nishio, and others attended and made important agreements. Army Minister Terauchi, based on the results of the meeting of the three chiefs, visited General Ugaki at the cabinet formation headquarters at 5:42 PM today. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to the Army Ministry's announcement of the results of the meeting of the three chiefs, it has replied to General Ugaki with the intention of declining all recommended candidates for Army Minister. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The cabinet formation headquarters announced at 6:30 PM that the army authorities had selected three candidates to succeed as Army Minister, and after negotiations, asked them to take office, but all declined. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Ugaki's hope of forming a new cabinet is dwindling today. It is said that he will announce the failure of cabinet formation tonight. It is extremely difficult to predict who will succeed Ugaki in this arduous task. It seems difficult to break through the current difficulties within three or four days. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The army's refusal to join the cabinet has generally been regarded as completely hopeless for General Ugaki's cabinet formation work. However, General Ugaki's attitude is not to resign at this point. He still intends to carefully consider future policies and seek second and third steps. He has not given up hope for cabinet formation and is currently struggling to find any way to break the deadlock. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki issued a statement at 9:00 PM today, resolving to make efforts to form a cabinet in accordance with the established policy. The content is as follows: It is regrettable that cabinet formation has not progressed. However, in view of the current situation, I am still able to do my best to ensure the safety of the country. This is my responsibility, so I should carefully consider and find a good solution. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<h3>Sugiyama Runs Between Terauchi and Ugaki</h3>
<p>Denies He Will Become Army Minister</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Director-General of Education Sugiyama, from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM today, discussed everything with Army Minister Terauchi at the Army Minister's official residence regarding the army's attitude towards General Ugaki's cabinet formation. However, because the situation within the army is becoming increasingly rigid, it cannot be left unattended. General Sugiyama, as a friend of Ugaki, visited General Ugaki at the cabinet formation headquarters at 11:00 AM in his personal capacity to explain the situation within the army in more detail and subtly requested General Ugaki to give it deep consideration. He also said that although General Ugaki had asked Army Minister Terauchi to recommend a successor as Army Minister, the current situation within the department meant that even if someone was recommended, they would certainly refuse to take office. As a result, recommendation is extremely difficult. At this time, it is hoped that General Ugaki will correctly recognize the current situation within the department and deal with it properly. It can be seen that the situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, and the future of cabinet formation is even more difficult to be optimistic about. After meeting with General Ugaki, General Sugiyama told reporters at the Army Minister's official residence, "My visit to General Ugaki today has suddenly led to rumors that I will join the cabinet, but that is not the case at all. I only explained the situation within the army in detail in my personal capacity. The details cannot be disclosed." (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Director-General of Education Sugiyama visited former Army Minister Terauchi at the Army Minister's official residence at 9:00 AM on the 26th to discuss the issue of General Ugaki's cabinet formation. At 9:05 AM, Commander of the Konoe Division Lieutenant General Kazuki also arrived at the Army Minister's official residence and held talks with Director-General Sugiyama. He left after half an hour. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Army Minister Terauchi returned to the Army Minister's official residence from the cabinet meeting at 1:00 PM today. Director-General Sugiyama, who had just met with General Ugaki, was already waiting at the official residence. Vice Chief of the General Staff Nishio and Vice Minister Umezu then joined in, and Director-General Sugiyama reported on the content of the meeting with General Ugaki. At the same time, important opinions were exchanged regarding future policies. The meeting adjourned at 2:30 PM. (Domei News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Regarding the content of the meeting between Director-General of Education Sugiyama and General Ugaki, Imaida Kiyotoku said, "Director-General Sugiyama and General Ugaki have been close friends for a long time, so he will meet with Ugaki in the future to explain the internal affairs of the army. The cabinet formation headquarters has not received a reply from former Army Minister Terauchi, and it is not known whether it will receive his reply today. Whether General Ugaki will visit Terauchi again if his reply is delayed has not yet been decided. General Ugaki did not request the military to recommend Director-General Sugiyama as his successor as Army Minister. I do not want to speculate in my personal capacity whether the cabinet formation work can proceed smoothly. I will temporarily observe the situation and then negotiate with powerful figures to join the cabinet." (Domei, 26th)</p>
<h3>Military Divided on Ugaki</h3>
<p>Ugaki Responds with Extreme Caution</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The difficulties encountered by Ugaki in forming a new cabinet have not yet been resolved. However, Ugaki seems determined to achieve the goal of forming a cabinet. At the same time, the military is not entirely opposed to Ugaki. Some of them also expressed their support. Those who oppose Ugaki point out that Ugaki not only had to answer for the reduction of four divisions during the Kato cabinet in 1925 (i.e., from 21 divisions to 17 divisions), but also had a relationship with the so-called March Incident in 1931. On the contrary, those who support Ugaki say that the formation of the four-division reduction in the Kato cabinet was actually urged by public opinion, so Ugaki had no choice but to implement it. Moreover, the funds saved by the reduction were allocated for the modernization of the army, thus laying the foundation for the modernization of the Japanese army today. Therefore, this reduction should not be regarded as advocated by Ugaki. They also said that during the second Saionji cabinet, Ugaki was only the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry. At that time, he strongly advocated adding two army divisions, which led to the collapse of the Saionji cabinet. As for the so-called March Incident in 1931, Ugaki's lack of involvement has long been proven, so there is no need to reiterate it. This interesting debate shows a subtle relationship behind the scenes. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Lieutenant General Tatekawa met with General Ugaki and said briefly, "The Army believes that if General Ugaki takes the post of Prime Minister, the situation, whether good or bad, will be left aside, and the overall atmosphere of the military will raise concerns. It is unreasonable to fall into this state in the middle of military restructuring. Therefore, the entire army unanimously hopes that General Ugaki will resign and try to deal with the situation properly. I am here to convey this." (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] After General Ugaki accepted the mandate to form a cabinet, in view of the extremely serious current situation, he decided to implement his cabinet formation mission in accordance with the established policy in order to reassure the Emperor. On the afternoon of the 25th, he visited the Minister of the Army and the Minister of the Navy to explain the basic policy and outline of the cabinet formation, and asked the military to recommend candidates for the Minister of the Army and the Minister of the Navy. However, the army had not released its misgivings about General Ugaki, and the navy also took the same attitude as the army. Therefore, Ugaki's cabinet formation work is proceeding with great difficulty. Ugaki himself is doing his best to carry out the cabinet formation work with the policy of absolutely avoiding friction with the army. On the one hand, he is adopting the army's demands such as implementing national policy, reforming government administration, and purifying the political world, and is waiting for the army's response with an extremely cautious attitude. He does not want to urge the army to decide its attitude. If the content of the army's response is not satisfactory, or if its response is delayed, he will maintain a patient attitude and strive to understand the current situation. Regardless of any obstacles, he will resolutely move towards the goal of cabinet formation. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The cabinet formation headquarters carefully discussed countermeasures this morning with General Ugaki as the center. At 9:30 AM, Akagi Asaji, Kawasaki Katsu, Ken Shinobu, Matsumoto Manabu, Isai Seiichiro, Count Mizoguchi, and others entered the cabinet formation headquarters one after another to participate in the meeting. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] General Ugaki invited Resource Bureau Director General Matsui to the cabinet formation headquarters on the morning of the 26th and asked him to explain the administrative structure and other issues. Director General Matsui then told reporters, "I was invited today because General Ugaki wanted to hear about the reform of the administrative structure, the controlled economy, and other issues. I only explained the current situation and its future, and nothing else was discussed." (Domei, 26th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] It is said that Ugaki's cabinet formation policy can be described as follows: ㊀ In order to realize the unification of political innovation and a strong administration, capable and talented people will be selected to fill the positions of cabinet members. The number of cabinet seats will be limited to six or seven, with one person concurrently holding the political affairs of several ministries. The positions of vice ministers in each ministry will be abolished. ㊁ The Diet system is taken into account, and existing political parties will be transformed so that they can implement national policies in name and substance during times of emergency. If cabinet members are selected from political parties, they should give up their party membership. (Central News Agency, 26th)</p>
<h3>Imaida Announces Ugaki's Statement</h3>
<p>Will Not Take Extraordinary Measures</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Imaida Kiyotoku issued a statement as follows: General Ugaki has been considering various matters alone so far. He does not intend to go out tonight, nor has he invited anyone. Minister of the Navy Nagano has not been notified either. Whether General Ugaki will visit the Imperial Palace tomorrow is currently under consideration and cannot be predicted. As for whether there is room for negotiation with the army, various situations are also being considered. If it is thought that extraordinary measures are being taken, there will be many misunderstandings. What General Ugaki has stated is that he will fully consider it, which is his natural responsibility. As for whether there are other solutions, it is not yet the time to talk about it. In addition, there will be no use of telephones to negotiate the selection of other cabinet members. (Domei, 26th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy's Response Pleases Britain and France</h3>
<p>Monitoring System is Feasible</p>
<p>[London] British and French officials are quite satisfied with the replies from the German and Italian governments to the UK's proposal to ban volunteers from going to Spain. Both countries' replies were published yesterday, agreeing to an appropriate monitoring system and proposing to remove non-Spanish combatants, including political volunteers, propagandists, and agitators. The British government views the two countries' replies as accepting in principle the British proposal to ban volunteers from going to Spain. All representatives on the Non-Intervention Committee for Spain's Civil War have now reached a compromise on this point. The Committee will consider each country's reply to the British document. It is generally predicted that the Committee will not find it difficult to agree on a monitoring plan in accordance with the guidelines already drawn up by the technical subcommittee. Paris officials believe that it is now possible to set an implementation date and details for the monitoring system sooner rather than later. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>[London] Regarding the issue of banning volunteers from going to Spain, after the replies from the Italian and German governments were received, many officials here expressed their appreciation, believing that the two countries' replies would enable an agreement to be reached quickly on the issue of banning volunteers and monitoring ships of all countries sailing to Spanish ports. What is particularly satisfying to officials is that although the replies from Italy and Germany raised some reservations regarding the issue of banning volunteers, they did not raise any preconditions. The Foreign Office has now sent copies of the Italian and German governments' replies to the Chairman of the Adjustment Committee, Lord Plymouth, Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, for study. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding the issue of banning volunteers from going to Spain, the German government's reply to the new proposal put forward by the United Kingdom was delivered to the British Foreign Office this afternoon. It is learned that the content of the reply is roughly as follows: ㊀ The German government has already drafted laws to ban German volunteers from entering Spain and to ban volunteers of any country from passing through German territory to go to Spain. ㊁ The Non-Intervention Committee for Spain in London should immediately find a way to enable the major related countries to reach an agreement on the main measures for non-intervention in the Spanish civil war, their implementation dates, and the principles of the monitoring system in the future. After this is realized, Germany will issue special laws to comply with. ㊂ Regarding the implementation of monitoring, Germany will submit various supplementary proposals to the British government. ㊃ The German government believes that it is necessary to withdraw all foreign combat personnel currently assisting in Spain. In conclusion, the document states that all countries should now seriously seek to avoid various possibilities of intervention in the Spanish civil war. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Spain to Promulgate New Constitution</h3>
<p>Implement Republican Autonomy</p>
<p>[London] It is widely rumored here that the Spanish Republican government is about to promulgate a new constitution, the main points of which are: ㊀ Stating that the Spanish political system is definitely not communist in nature, so that Italy and Germany will lose their excuse to assist General Franco. ㊁ The Spanish provinces should obtain broad autonomy within the scope of the federal system. Well-informed sources believe that the promulgation of this new constitution will have a decisive impact on the future development of the Spanish civil war. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Pope's Condition is Good</h3>
<p>Vatican City: The Pope's condition continues to improve. He slept very well last night, and the pain in his legs has also been greatly reduced. He got out of bed this morning and moved to an easy chair. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Journalist in France, Navachine, Assassinated</h3>
<p>Suspected of Revealing the Truth About Counter-Revolutionary Cases; Indicates a Political Revenge Plot</p>
<p>[Paris] Navachine, a Soviet journalist and economist residing in France, was assassinated this morning near the Bois de Boulogne by an unknown assailant, who immediately fled the scene. Navachine served as the general manager of the Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord, a Soviet-established bank in Paris, from 1926 until his resignation in 1930. He then devoted himself to economics and journalism and was well acquainted with the current French Minister of Economic Affairs, Spinasse, and many prominent political figures. According to The Times, Navachine was a close friend of both Pyatakov and Sokolnikov, defendants in the Moscow "Parallel Centre" case, and possessed special information regarding the case's details. Therefore, Russian circles here suspect that this assassination has political motivations. The police have launched an investigation. It is learned that the deceased left home around 9:00 AM this morning, accompanied by two dogs, to stroll in the Bois de Boulogne. Despite the rain, he lingered until 10:30 AM before tiring and returning. While passing the "Prince's Gate" (opposite the Roland Garros tennis stadium), a passerby named Le Fèvre witnessed Navachine struggling with a man wearing a light-colored woolen shirt. In an instant, Navachine fell to the ground, motionless, and the assailant quickly fled. Navachine's wife also declared to the police that three weeks ago, a Russian man had sought to meet her husband. Upon meeting, he claimed it was a case of mistaken identity and that the person he intended to meet was younger. Navachine's wife added that she and her husband came to Paris in 1921. In 1924, her husband briefly returned to Moscow before being appointed as the general manager of the Banque Commerciale pour l'Europe du Nord, a position he resigned from in 1930 to pursue journalism. Her husband had no enemies during his lifetime, and she is unsure as to why he was assassinated. Aside from the statements made by the witness, Le Fèvre, and Navachine's wife, the police have not yet obtained any other leads. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the assassination of Soviet journalist Navachine, it has recently been learned that until 1932, the deceased worked diligently for the Soviet government. Afterward, he became estranged from the Moscow authorities. The French police have commenced an investigation. Some Russians here believe that Navachine was assassinated because he intended to reveal information about the Moscow counter-revolutionary cases. This has sparked fierce debate among both left-wing and right-wing factions in France. The Communist Party's official newspaper, "L'Humanité," proclaimed, "The assassination method is favored by Trotskyites and the German secret police. This is a self-evident matter." The right-wing newspaper "Le Jour" stated that the leader of the White Russian émigrés in France, General Kutepov, was kidnapped in Paris in 1930. The Navachine case is, in fact, a repeat of the Kutepov case. The Soviet authorities have resorted to political revenge in plain sight, fearing that Navachine would reveal information about the counter-revolutionary cases, and therefore silenced him to prevent him from speaking out. A close friend of Navachine's, who practiced law in Paris, was recently summoned back to Moscow and has since disappeared without a trace. He is likely connected to the case. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>Mexico City: Leon Trotsky, the leader of the anti-Stalinist faction of the Soviet Communist Party, recently issued a statement regarding the assassination of Soviet journalist Navachine in Paris. He claimed that after assassinating Navachine, the Soviet secret police would plot to harm Sedov (Trotsky's son). After the conclusion of the so-called "Parallel Centre" case in Moscow, the Soviet authorities will fabricate charges against others. Their methods are as cruel as those of the devil.

<h3>Continued Trial of Russian Counter-Revolutionary Case</h3>
<p>Defendants All Plead Guilty</p>
<p>[Moscow] When the trial of seventeen defendants, including the well-known Soviet journalist Radek, resumed today, the defendants continued to confess to their crimes. Although the case is still under consideration, the Soviet newspapers have already published resolutions with strong language, demanding the death penalty for the defendants. The atmosphere in the courtroom was quite tense at one point. When the defendant, Mr. Shestov, recounted his failed attempt to assassinate Soviet officials, the former People's Commissar of Military Affairs, Mr. Muralov, who had previously served as Trotsky's aide-de-camp, stood up and shouted that the defendant's account was entirely false. He claimed that he himself had ordered the assassination of the aforementioned individuals. Shestov continued that he had plotted to sabotage the Novokuznetsk coal mine with the help of a German engineer. However, the plan failed because some children found the intended explosives and played with them, resulting in their deaths. Because a certain Russian engineer discovered his plot and intended to report it to the authorities, he ordered his assassination. Mr. Shestov concluded by saying that he later infiltrated a bank with the German engineer and stole 184,000 rubles for sabotage expenses. Another defendant, Mr. Boguslavsky, initially denied everything but later confessed to his crimes. When the prosecutor questioned the inconsistency, Mr. Boguslavsky denied that his confession was due to imprisonment, any pressure, or to reduce his sentence. He confessed because he had a pang of conscience and realized that all the activities of the Trotskyist group were harmful to the country and the people. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Military Collegium of the Supreme Court continues to hear the case of the counter-revolutionary organization "Parallel Centre." One of the defendants, Drobnis, testified that starting in 1934, he was ordered by the defendant Pyatakov to preside over sabotage work in the Kuznetsk coal mining area. He later went to the Grelovo region to serve as the deputy director of construction affairs for a chemical plant. As a result, he did not participate in the sabotage activities of the Trotskyist faction for some time, which displeased Pyatakov. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japan and Germany Plan Cultural Cooperation</h3>
<p>Vice Admiral Forster Appointed President of the German-Japanese Society</p>
<p>[Berlin] Professor Honda, a Japanese scholar who formerly worked at the German Institute for Japanese Studies, is scheduled to return to Japan next month. He recently stated in an interview with our reporter that it is necessary for Japan and Germany to conclude a cultural agreement. He said, "This type of agreement is even more important than the Anti-Comintern Pact previously signed between Japan and Germany. After the cultural agreement is concluded, German youth should go to Japan to study Japanese academic culture, and Japanese youth should also be sent to Germany to study at German schools." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Vice Admiral Forster, commander of the German Baltic Fleet, retired at the end of last year. It is now confirmed that Vice Admiral Forster will succeed the late Grand Admiral von Koester as president of the German-Japanese Society. He will also serve as the director of the Japanese Institute, to ensure that the German-Japanese Society and the Japanese Institute are linked together. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japan Orders Cruisers from Italy</h3>
<p>Elite Torpedo Boat Launched</p>
<p>[Rome] The naval shipyard in Livorno began construction of a 3,000-ton light cruiser on the 14th of this month. It has now been learned that the warship was commissioned by Japan. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Russia Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>[Moscow] The US Ambassador to Russia, Davies, presented his credentials to Kalinin, the chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union, today. After the formal procedures were completed, the US Ambassador spoke with Mr. Kalinin for twenty minutes. (National News Agency, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Commercial Firms in China Suffer Trademark Infringement</h3>
<p>British Members of Parliament Request Government Attention</p>
<p>[London] During today's session of the House of Commons, Conservative Member of Parliament, Mr. Chorlton, asked the government to pay attention to the fact that British commercial firms in China are displeased with recent incidents of Chinese merchants imitating trademarks registered in China by British firms. He asked whether the British government would inform the Chinese government and request that it prohibit the unauthorized use of various trademarks in accordance with Chinese trademark law to deceive the public. He added that the note to China should also urge the Chinese government to amend the trademark law to prevent registrants from using similar trademarks for similar products, regardless of whether they are registered as being in the same category, which is deceiving the public and should be deemed illegal. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Viscount Cranborne, replied, "The Chinese imitation of British trademarks has always been closely monitored by the government. In the future, all possible steps will continue to be taken to protect the interests of British commercial firms in China and to prevent the unauthorized use of their registered trademarks in China. The issue of trademark law has been carefully considered by the government and is still under consideration. Before the implementation of the Chinese trademark law, the British Ambassador to China often sent documents to the Chinese government regarding the interests of British commercial firms. Last July, he submitted various points, requesting that the Chinese government pay attention to the relevant administrative departments." Viscount Cranborne also stated that he had no further news to add. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<h3>This Year's Fujian Province Regimented Black Tea Exports</h3>
<p>Quota Set at 75,000 Cases, Loans of 500,000 [Currency] Authorized; Tea Warehouses Will Be Handled Like Anhui and Jiangxi If They Don't Comply</p>
<p>Xiamen dispatch: Black tea is an important product of Fujian Province and a major export commodity. The Fujian Provincial Department of Construction, believing that the black tea business has been poorly managed in recent years and that the international market has been gradually shrinking, has decided to regiment the export trade. It has prepared measures for the regimented export and sale of black tea in Fujian Province, along with provisional regulations for the registration of black tea merchants, a general outline of the export black tea sales funds and loan plans, and other documents. These have been passed by the 104th meeting of the Provincial Government Committee and ordered by the Department of Construction to be followed by the tea warehouse management office. An examination of the 1937 export black tea sales funds and loan plan shows that it is divided into two points: (1) The number of black tea cases to be exported this year is tentatively set at 60,000 cases from the northern route (eastern Fujian), 15,000 cases from the western route (northern Fujian), 3,000 cases of Xingcun Xiaozhong [black tea], and the remaining 12,000 cases, for a total of 75,000 cases. The lowest estimated price of black tea from the northern route is 22 yuan per case, for a total price of 1,320,000 yuan. The estimated price of Xingcun Xiaozhong from the western route is 75 yuan per case, for a total price of 225,000 yuan. The estimated price of the remaining black tea is 40 yuan per case, for a total price of 480,000 yuan. The total price of the above three items is 2,020,000 yuan. The average planned loan for black tea from the northern route is 8 yuan per case (based on the principle of not exceeding 60% of the value), for a total of 480,000 yuan. The average loan for black tea from the western route is planned to be 15 yuan per case, for a loan amount of 225,000 yuan. The total of the two items is 750,000 yuan. Based on the above total business volume of 2,020,000 yuan, the fixed capital is tentatively calculated as one-tenth of the total, amounting to 200,000 yuan. If tea warehouses are willing to register and subscribe to shares, they will be given priority to subscribe to shares within the 200,000 yuan share amount, based on the number of operating ranges of each black tea warehouse in 1937. The government only guarantees loans of 500,000 yuan from banks. If the tea warehouses adhere to their old habits, are limited by their preconceptions, and are willing to abandon themselves by refusing to register and subscribe to shares, the government will have no choice but to follow the Anhui and Jiangxi black tea sales methods, intending to remove the intermediary tea warehouses, and the government will guarantee loans of 700,000 yuan and directly distribute them to inland tea firms (i.e., tea merchants). (2) After being registered and approved, inland tea firms will be guided by the tea warehouse management office to organize joint tea firms. Tea merchants who have not registered will absolutely not be allowed to engage in export operations. When applying for a loan, they must prepare sufficient basic funds and provide joint and several guarantees. After being reviewed and approved by the sales office, they will be granted a loan limited to a corresponding number of cases, based on the principle of not exceeding 60% of the value. All of the tea produced must be transported to the tea warehouse sales office for sale. The proceeds from the sale of tea must be used to repay the loan principal and interest first. If it is not enough, each tea firm will be jointly and severally liable for compensation. Furthermore, when the loan is recovered, the principal and interest of the bank loan should be repaid first. The Department of Construction has ordered the office to be responsible for handling export inspections, the initial registration of black tea merchants, the registration of inland tea merchants, and the registration of interpreters, and has also ordered them to draft various rules and regulations and the articles of association of the sales office, along with the black tea export inspection measures, and submit them for inspection and approval.

<h3>Jiangxi Province's Economy and Banking Industry</h3>
<p>All Twelve Banks Had Profits Last Year; Each Bank's Business Shifts from Urban to Rural Areas; Provincial Yumin Bank Completes Provincial Financial Network</p>
<p>Nanchang dispatch: The banking business in Jiangxi Province has been very developed in recent years, while the money shop business has been declining. This is also an inevitable trend of modern economics. As of the end of 1936, there were four self-established banks in the province: Yumin, Construction, Municipal, and Erzhi. There were eight branch banks established in Jiangxi by other places: Central, China, Communications, Farmers, Shanghai, Guohuo, Continental, and Industrial. In light of the past experiences of Jiangxi banks making large loans to government offices and issuing banknotes indiscriminately, resulting in the collapse of banknotes worth thousands of millions of yuan, each bank has adopted prudent and stable methods. Especially in the midst of this economic decline, all efforts have been made to tighten credit, preferring to have a lack of loans than to have them be abused, looking lightly on interest rates and heavily on capital. They all focus on remittances, secured loans, and the buying and selling of securities, without the fault of pulling empty shelves, being greedy for more, abusing loans, or speculating. Therefore, each bank has profits and no losses, and there are no bad debt businesses. Especially with the consolidation of the legal currency last year, the stability of foreign exchange, the bumper harvests in rural areas, and the increase in import and export goods (last year's import and export trade was nearly 80 million yuan), the profits were particularly great. According to statistics released by the Provincial Government Statistics Office, the total deposits of each bank (including branch banks in each county), excluding the Central and Continental banks, which are unknown, amounted to 75,924,621 yuan, loans amounted to 92,857,902 yuan, remittances amounted to 126,755,423 yuan remitted out, and 94,902,822 yuan remitted in. The deposits of more than 70 million yuan, divided by the province's 20 million people, result in an average savings of more than 3 yuan per person. However, this is mostly accounted for by the business community and residents, while farmers' savings are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Furthermore, in terms of remittances, more than 12.8 million yuan was remitted out, while only 9.4 million yuan was remitted in, indicating that the province still has a trade deficit of more than 20 million yuan. Last year, the Yumin Bank had the most profits, totaling 500,000 yuan, because it is the only financial hub for the entire province, with branches and offices throughout the counties and cities. 1-jiao, 2-jiao, 5-jiao subsidiary currency and copper coin notes circulate throughout the province, penetrating everywhere. Even in extremely remote counties where other banks cannot reach, the bank can still provide financial services, so it makes the most profit. The branch banks established in the province by other places had profits ranging from 50,000 to 100,000 yuan, while smaller ones, such as the Municipal and Erzhi banks, also had profits of several thousand to 10,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>As for the trend of each bank's business, it is extremely related to the province's economy and industry. Therefore, I will describe it together as follows: The Central, China, and Communications banks are national banks of our country, and their business is no different from that of the head office. The purpose of the Farmers Bank is to serve the rural areas. Last year, in addition to lending more than 600,000 yuan to the Cooperative Committee to be re-lent to the rural areas, it is also cooperating with the Nanchang Cooperative Treasury to provide land mortgage loans in Nanchang. The purpose of the Yumin Bank is to complete the financial network of the province, setting a deadline of 1940 to establish branches and offices in all counties and towns. Ordinary commercial banks such as Shanghai, Continental, and Guohuo focus on secured loans, remittances, and the buying and selling of securities. However, each bank deeply feels the necessity of investing in production and rural areas, no longer limiting their vision to the urban circle as before. For example, last year, the Central, China, and Communications banks lent 1 million yuan to the provincial government to build farmers' associations in various rice-producing centers, and the Communications, Yumin, and Farmers banks lent 500,000 yuan to the Rural Cooperative Committee to handle rice pledge and assist rural production. These are all shifts in the financial industry's business and the beginning of rural revitalization. (January 25th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang Soldier Brutally Murders Comrade</h3>
<p>Last night (the 25th), in the 3rd squad of the tax police stationed at Desheng Harbor, a soldier, Lin Yingkun, had a slight disagreement with Cao Jie, a soldier on the same boat. Cao was naturally violent and fond of drinking. Last night, he had already fallen asleep, so when Lin got off the boat and went to sleep, just as he was bending over to open the door of the boat, a bullet was fired from inside, hitting Lin's left side and piercing his chest and abdomen. He fell to the bow of the boat, screaming for help. His comrades inspected and, seeing that a disaster had occurred, detained the murderer, Cao Jie, and carried the injured man to the squad headquarters. Before they could treat him, he died. They reported it to the local court, and Chief Zhang personally led the coroner Gong to the countryside for an autopsy, which confirmed that he had died from his injuries. The murderer, Cao Jie, will be sent to the court for punishment.</p>
<h3>Highly Contagious Epidemic Discovered in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the weather has been abnormal, with sudden cold and hot spells, coupled with a scarcity of rain and snow, resulting in the discovery of widespread epidemic diseases in urban and rural areas. In the Ninth District, in the area around Fuzhou Village in Qibao Township, an epidemic has recently been discovered, which is very fierce. Initially, there are headaches, followed by cholera-like vomiting and diarrhea. Within a quarter of an hour, the person dies. In half a month, more than ten people have died. The local villagers are terrified and are now trying to extinguish it.</p>
<p>Requesting Exemption from Late Payment Penalties for Land Tax</p>
<p>Since the opening of the collection of the second term land tax in this county, it has been nearly two months. Now, the initial deadline is only five days away. Various businesses are still waiting and seeing. The number of collections at the Land Tax Office is still not prosperous, with only about 20,000 yuan per day. The reason for this is that, according to the old customs of Xiyi [Wuxi], villagers come to the city to pay taxes, with the Lunar New Year's Eve as the final closing date. After the deadline for the land tax in this term was changed by the provincial authorities, although the county government issued a notice, most villagers are illiterate and difficult to know. The county magistrate, Long, has telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, requesting permission to exempt the 3% late payment penalty from the deadline to the Lunar New Year's Eve, for the sake of the people. Those who still do not pay by the end of the year must pay a 6% late payment penalty.</p>
<h3>Murder Case Occurs During Sale of Land in Changzhou</h3>
<p>Gu Yuliang of Longde Township, Fourth District of Wuyi, sold a piece of high-quality land to someone. While he was writing the official contract, Gu Longjin and his wife suddenly came to snatch the official contract, and ordered their two sons, Gu Tugeng and Atu, to chop off Yuliang's left hand and stab him in the head three times, leaving him on the verge of death. Then, the township head and others sent Gu Longjin's wife, Jiang, to the district office, and the remaining murderers fled. District Chief Wang Zushu sent Gu Jiang to the county government on the 25th, and then transferred her to the local court for interrogation. The murderer Gu Longjin fled to the vicinity of Weicun Town and was arrested by the local police station. He has also been sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Overview of Profits and Losses of Various Banks in Changshu</h3>
<p>After investigating the profit and loss status of various banks here last year, it was found that the China and Communications banks were the best. For example, the China Bank had deposits of more than 2 million yuan, and its annual business could have a surplus of more than 30,000 yuan. The Communications Bank also had a surplus of more than 20,000 yuan, although its deposits were slightly reduced. Other banks, such as the Farmers Bank, established warehouses in various villages and provided various types of farmer loans, and the Jiangsu Bank provided small loans, which were quite effective. In addition, the provincial government has designated these two banks as treasuries in recent years, and all government agencies must deposit and withdraw public funds through these two banks, so their profits are also high, with each earning about 10,000 yuan. The China Industrial Bank created small loans of 500 yuan or less last year and earned 10,000 yuan as a result. The Guohuo Bank and the Jin Cheng Bank, which established a branch in Changshu, originally hoped to absorb local cash but did not provide many loans, so they did not have much surplus. The Zhejiang Xingye Bank only opened a few months ago, so its business status is difficult to compare with other banks.</p>
<p>Construction of Qinggang Road</p>
<p>The Department of Construction recently planned to build a highway from Changshu to connect with Jiangyin, named Jiangchang Road. Because Yangfu Road has been completed, it was decided to change the route. It is now planned to start from Changre and Gangkou Town, pass through Xishu City, Zhoujia Pier, and Gushan, which is located at the intersection of Xichengchang, and reach Qingyang in Jiangyin, naming it Qinggang Road. Now that Yangfu Road has been completed, Gangkou is located in the center of Yangfu Road. If Qinggang Road is completed, cars can travel from Xihulu to Yangfu Road and directly reach Jiangyin. In fact, the Qinggang Road project is more economical and can save resources, and transportation will be equally convenient. The Department of Construction has ordered the county to comply.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Honghu Embankment Will Be Constructed</h3>
<p>The Honghu Embankment is a protective barrier for Huaiyang. The Department of Construction had previously been limited by funding, so it only urgently repaired all of the masonry engineering, which was still incomplete. The earthwork of the embankment was also untidy. Now, the Sanhe sports field is under construction. The Honghu Embankment must be repaired completely in order to complement the other project and permanently prevent disasters. In the middle of last month, the Department of Construction received a repair plan chart submitted by the Canal Engineering Bureau, which required more than 2,217,000 yuan, to be implemented in three phases. The first phase of urgent projects requires more than 592,000 yuan. It is heard that the Department of Construction has sent a letter to the River Conservancy Commission, requesting that it first approve the plan and then raise funds to start construction.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou Provincial Government Strictly Handles Local Bullies</h3>
<p>Sheng Lianxin, a well-known local bully in Xiaoshan, monopolized the wild silk business in his hometown of Dongxiang, adding the Xin [surname] mark to the Dongxiang Cooperative organized by farmers and seizing it for himself, as well as other illegal activities. The villagers were oppressed by him and dared not speak out. After receiving a report, the provincial government ordered the wild silk regimentation association of the Department of Construction to investigate and handle the case together with the special commissioner He of the Shaoxing District. Sheng was hiding in Hangzhou and was arrested by the Public Security Bureau and transferred to the court. Yesterday (the 26th), after interrogating him, Prosecutor Zhao of the High Court ordered him to be sent to the detention center and handed over to the Hangzhou Local Court for legal interrogation.</p>
<h3>Minor Details of the Corruption Case Involving Nantong Police Officers</h3>
<p>The team leader of the Public Security Bureau's Investigation Team, Yao Dangping, the detective, Yang Weiting, and others embezzled the banknotes seized from bandits. They have been detained by the Special Commissioner's Office and transferred to the court for interrogation. Now, because they shot and killed Xu Jinbiao's eleven-year-old son at the time, Prosecutor Xu is conducting an investigation. On February 6, the people involved in the case will be summoned for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Eastern Wind and Rain...The Clouds Facing North (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Ming Xin</p>
<p>This journey took me from Zheng to Luo, westward to Tonghua. The perils of Xiaohan, historically the earliest strategic locations in the Central Plains, reminded me of Meng Ming's advice to the Qin army: "I will have two mounds prepared where I will collect your bones." Qin did not listen, and ultimately suffered defeat. Comparing the past to the present, the sudden uprising in Shaanxi – will the outcome be the same? My wandering footsteps then crossed Tongguan and arrived in Hedong, turning north to enter Jin, eventually reaching Yangqu. I lingered over Du Fu's brilliant lines, feeling the similarity of time and place. I gathered these thoughts into an article, hoping to provide some guidance.</p>
<p>My trip to Tongguan lasted two days. The general state of military preparedness I observed is roughly outlined below. West of Tongguan are Dongquan Dian, Huayin, Xiaying, Liuzhi, and finally Huaxian, only a few tens of kilometers away, a journey that would normally take little time. However, due to frequent military mobilization, passenger vehicles have been suspended. There is only one transport vehicle daily for military use. Due to delays caused by yielding the way to other vehicles and unloading grain, it can take as long as four or five hours to reach Huaxian. Although the county seat is a small earthen town, since the troops arrived, the entire city has been effectively placed under military control. Not only is there insufficient housing, but food and supplies are also difficult to maintain. Fortunately, the troops are well-disciplined and adequately supplied. As a result, not only do the local people not flee, but more than thirty temporary restaurants and general stores have sprung up, reflecting the temporary prosperity amidst the chaos of war.</p>
<p>Military deployments are sensitive matters; those who hear of them should not spread them widely. The Zhang department is stationed at the foremost frontline, consisting of six divisions, from the 104th to the 109th. There are vague rumors that units under Liu Duoquan and Miao Zhengliu, among others, are inclined to internalize. One reason is that the specific details are still under discussion, another is that many of their family members are still in the rear. Therefore, considerable time is still needed. The central government has not yet abandoned its peaceful stance. Thus, Mi Chunlin and Li Zhigang flew to Xi'an again yesterday. A certain important official, upon leaving Taiyuan, even publicly told reporters: "There are already sound solutions for Shaanxi and Gansu, and it is by no means a major problem. We are not enemies of each other and should be able to understand. This is merely a temporary dispute, which should be resolved peacefully in the short term. However, China is a whole, and two governments will never be tolerated. We hope the Communist bandits will thoroughly awaken and abolish the puppet organization." All of this has appeared in the Jin newspapers and can be verified. However, those working on the front lines advocate for a swift and decisive solution, fearing that prolonged delay will strengthen the Communist Party's influence and because internalized troops cannot demonstrate their capabilities until after engagement. In terms of military strength, the ratio is far more than a hundred to one; achieving a decisive victory in ten days is foreseeable. These opinions differ due to differing circumstances, but with unified planning, they can converge on the same goal. Currently, the question of peace or war remains a mystery.</p>
<p>Within Xi'an, due to transportation disruptions, rumors vary. However, on the 16th, Yang Yuhui telegraphed his willingness to assume his new position and to abolish other organizations formed after December 12th. The full text has been read and understood. Whether this is sincere and how things will be handled in the future remains to be seen; we must wait for the facts to prove it. Xi'an's military strength is very weak. Yang Hucheng has only one division and one brigade. One division is stationed in the city. Many of its political and training personnel have joined the Communist bandits. Sun Mingjiu, of the Northeast faction, serves as the director of the military police inspection department and is maintaining strict vigilance. Some say that Yang is already surrounded and monitored by the Communist Party and cannot act freely. The majority of the Communist bandits are concentrated in northern Shaanxi, planning to move south to the Wei River on one side, while still hastily building rafts to cross the river, aiming to strike into Jin Province. A small number of Communist bandits are also present in front of the Wei River (temporary bandits, including those who have transformed from the Republic itself). Weinan and Xi'an have both been looted, and Weinan, in particular, is almost entirely deserted. Sun Weiru has always had great ambitions and was eager to accept the new appointment, but was ultimately blocked by the Communist bandits. Feng Qinzai, who has a close personal relationship with Yang, is stationed in northern Wei and has also been to Tongguan. It is said that he is currently urgently seeking a way to save Yang's reputation. He still maintains an office in Xi'an, which can communicate with Yang. However, it is difficult to say whether Yang, under duress, will be moved by the words of his old friend and comrade and make a decisive plan.</p>
<p>Yang Hucheng himself has a very high opinion of himself. Although not skilled in writing, he is quite intelligent. He has his secretary verbally recite official documents daily, but is able to correct their mistakes. He views writing with a brush as an insurmountable obstacle. When opening meetings, his handwritten signature is a demonstration of the "Spring Snake Autumn Earthworm" calligraphy style, and he always modestly says, "This is a technical problem, beyond my ability." He also likes to use new terms in his speeches and discussions, such as "purpose groups," which the late Qing Zhang Wenxiang dismissed as "Japanese slang" and refused to use. He particularly likes to use the word "art," but often inappropriately. Seeing a friend wearing new clothes, he would say, "Your clothes are particularly artistic," which would often be met with applause from the audience. Feng Qinzai, on the other hand, is bold and unconventional. His passions are calligraphy practice and listening to opera. He formed an improved Shaanxi opera troupe, and whenever guests arrived, he would summon them to perform, enjoying the applause and cheers. In reality, Shaanxi opera is extremely difficult to understand, and it is difficult to find one or two who can appreciate it. He also regularly writes Wei Dynasty calligraphy in a strict and disciplined style. He happily fulfills all requests for his calligraphy, preparing fine paper and completing it in one stroke before sending it to the guest's residence the next day. When idle, his competitive spirit often shows through. If someone challenges him to a game, he even scolds them to their face. Perhaps this is the true nature of a hero.</p>
<p>The reasons for the Shaanxi Incident cannot be fully explained in just a few words. In essence, the xenophobic mentality of the Shaanxi army contributed to it. Yang Hucheng has governed his army and hometown like his own fiefdom for quite some time. Since the Zhang department was stationed there, his power has been reduced. Furthermore, the national call for the development of the Northwest and the completion of the Longhai Railway to Chang'an, along with the reorganization of the provincial government and his subsequent dismissal, led those with limited knowledge in Shaanxi to believe that it would be difficult to maintain the status quo in the long run. Yang was particularly unwilling, as the leader of the Shaanxi army, to see the loss of power for the people of Shaanxi. His failure to consider the greater interests of the nation is deeply regrettable. The new administrators were mostly from other provinces, leading to accumulated resentment and the interpretation of the government's good intentions for development as exploitation of local resources. The brutal murder of Qiu Yuanwu last year and the smearing of excrement on newspaper offices were gradual expressions of this mentality. The Zhang department also had a large number of people, and it was difficult for their families to survive in the west. Although the leaders of the troops have not colluded with the communists, family members and relatives, seeing no way out, inevitably had thoughts that leaned toward the left. However, Zhang Xueliang, due to his personal relationship with Chairman Chiang, was still able to personally see him off to Nanjing on the 25th, and his troops are likely to internalize. Yang Hucheng himself does not understand communism, but will certainly not be tolerated by the Communist bandits either. However, compelled by circumstances, he took the risk. At the same time, the Communist bandits seized this opportunity and used it to the fullest extent to make him a puppet. Yang, an uneducated man, was deceived by temporary rumors and recklessly placed himself in danger. If this is prolonged, it will be difficult to extricate himself, and he will inevitably be destroyed along with everything else. (Report from Tongguan, dispatch from Taiyuan, 20th)</p>

<h3>Top British Amateur Football Team, Corinthians, to Tour China This Winter</h3>
<p>Selecting Twenty Players for a Six-Month Trip. The Sports Association Has Not Yet Announced This News.</p>
<p>When our country's World Games delegation went to Germany to participate in the conference last year, a certain important member of the delegation stayed in England and made private contact with Mr. Smith, the Secretary-General of the English Corinthian Amateur Football Club. Mr. Smith was deeply impressed by our country's World Games football team, and expressed his intention to form a team to visit the Far East. Now, this plan has been confirmed by a Reuters news report yesterday, stating that the club has decided to implement it this winter. However, the Sports Advancement Association and the Shanghai Westerners Football Club have not announced this news. It is scheduled to depart from England in November of this year, arriving in Shanghai around February of next year, during the Lunar New Year. Along the way, it will travel through Cairo, India, Burma, Malaysia, Shelley, China, Japan, and Canada. Among the above itinerary, it has been decided that a six-week stay in India has been agreed upon, with a guarantee of 3,000 pounds. In Shelley, due to repeated requests from the local authorities, it has also been decided to stay for a week without guarantee. In our country, Mr. Shen made private contact, guaranteeing an income of 1,500 pounds, which the club has also accepted, but it is not done through the Sports Association and the Shanghai Westerners Football Club. The club is now discussing the detailed plan of this long journey in detail, and the selection of personnel is also scheduled to be carried out in the summer. According to Mr. Smith, the secretary of the club, twenty of the best amateur players will be selected in London, and each famous club in England will have ample travel time of more than six months without worrying about interfering with their profession. Once the candidates are determined, they will be rigorously trained and will also conduct close exchanges with various famous amateur and professional teams in order to become a strong collective team rather than relying entirely on individual skills. He also expects this team to be the strongest among the English amateur football teams, not only breaking all records in England, but also creating a new situation in China, leaving a good image, and so on.</p>
<h3>Muir and Yueh Chung to Start Championship for Ordinary Groups in West Qing Tomorrow Night</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jing Wu Lost to Muir Again</p>
<p>Muir has already won the first match of the West Qing Ordinary Group A Championship against Jing Wu. Yesterday evening, they met again in West Qing. If Muir wins again, they can win the championship. If Jing Wu wins, they still have a chance. It is of great importance to them, so both sides put their full efforts into the match. After the match began, there was a lot of chaos at the beginning. The two sides were evenly matched for a long time. Then, Muir took the lead with Dong Yangfeng scoring, followed by Dong making a free throw, and Hua Yulin also tapping the ball into the basket. Muir had already scored five points. Jing Wu called a timeout. After the timeout, Jing Wu's Li Ruizhi opened the scoring with a long shot, and Zheng Jichang tapped the ball in under the basket. The score was 4 to 5, and the situation gradually became closer. However, they continued to waste opportunities with long shots. Muir then worked hard, and Hua Yulin scored two more goals in a row. At the end of the first quarter, Muir led with 9 to 4. At the beginning of the second quarter, Jing Wu's Ji Ruizhi shot from the center line, hitting the basket accurately. The score was 6 to 9, only one and a half points behind. Muir replaced Cheng Xuan with Ling Peng to rest, and the attack became sharper again. Dong Ling used free throws and field goals, adding eight points in one go, ending the first half with a score of 17 to 6. Muir had an absolute advantage. In the third quarter, Jing Wu's situation improved slightly with Hui Lindeng. After Muir's Hua and Dong both scored, Jing Wu's Li and Zheng also added five points. Muir's Hua Yulin explored the basket, and Jing Wu's Li Huilin also made a free throw. The two sides each scored six points in this quarter, and the situation was quite balanced, ending with a score of 23 to 12. Jing Wu was still at a disadvantage. Muir's Hua Yulin scored first in the last quarter, and Jing Wu's Ji Ruidong also made one of two free throws. After that, Muir's Huang Hua Nan scored two goals in a row, but Jing Wu's Li and Cai also retaliated in the same way. Before long, Jing Wu replaced Zhang Jinxuan, but there was less than a minute left, and it was useless. After that, Muir's Shen Hanjun and Jing Wu's Li Ruihua each scored with long shots, ending the game with a score of 31 to 19. Jing Wu suffered a second defeat, and Muir won the Group A final. Starting tomorrow night, they will compete with the Group B champion, John's Middle School, in a two-game, two-win championship to win the championship of this year's West Qing Ordinary Group. The order of the overall championship is already re-arranged by Mr. Braat, which is the first game at 8:15 tomorrow night, the second game at 6:00 on Saturday (30th), and the third game is tentatively scheduled for next Monday (February 1st). This game will be determined whether to play or not depending on the needs at that time.</p>

<h3>The Last Shot Turns the Tide; Zhu Qiliang Actually Wins Against Ding Mingyi</h3>
<p>Result: 1000 Points vs. 988. Today, Wu Chengxiang vs. Gaines</p>
<p>Ding Mingyi competed against Zhu Qiliang in the amateur group A target shooting championship yesterday on the upper floor of No. 88 Nanjing Road. Ding held an extreme advantage with 880 points vs. 721 when the back match was about to end. However, good times don't last long. In the blink of an eye, the two were neck and neck around 9780 points. At that moment, whoever stabilized the one shot first could be considered victorious. However, these two experienced shooters were both subject to environmental control, resulting in physical and mental unrest. After a long time, Zhu Qiliang finally pulled through and, with the point difference between 982 and 988, he reached the goal first with one shot of 18 points. Ding Mingyi, who had been leading all the way, failed to perform to his best in this crucial moment, resulting in a regrettable failure. Starting at 5:30 PM today, Wu Chengxiang will battle Gaines. The winner will compete with Zhu Qiliang for the championship.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiliang's record was good in the first match, exceeding 20 points 7 times. Ding only had 4 times. However, Ding was more likely to drop his gun and was leading at the beginning, so despite once being forced out by Zhu at around 400 points, he still finished the first match leading with 501 vs. 489 due to the accumulated score.</p>
<p>In the second match, Ding steadily moved forward, maintaining a large lead. He had a lead of more than 150 points over Zhu with six consecutive high scores. In that situation, whether the viewers or the participants thought Ding would be the winner that night. However, Zhu focused wholeheartedly and closely followed behind. Taking advantage of Ding's obstruction in the middle, the large score that had not appeared for a long time suddenly and continuously appeared. In the end, he took the lead with one shot and won, which can be said to be extremely lucky. Both are all-round talents. Mr. Ding's opening shot and Mr. Zhu's follow-up are particularly the signature moves of the two.</p>
<p>Zhu Qiliang (First Match): 25, 29, 23, 53, 33, 38, 29 (Second Match): 20, 43, 40, 28, 48, 25</p>
<p>Ding Mingyi (First Match): 20, 29, 36, 21, 38, 32, 27, 27, 29, 33</p>

This conference has a history of more than 30 years, and traditionally holds a conference every four years. This year's conference was originally scheduled to be convened next year, but because this year marks the 300th anniversary of the publication of the "Discourse on Method" by the great philosopher Descartes, this year's conference plans to focus on Descartes' work and was therefore advanced to this year.

Chinese member Mao Qi (currently a professor at National Zhejiang University) sent a research paper on the philosophy of history to Paris in October last year, preparing to present it at this conference. It is said that it was highly appreciated by Bergson and has been included in the conference's paper directory. This is the only paper presented by the Chinese side at this conference.</p>
<h3>The City Social Bureau Decides on Methods for Training Private School Teachers</h3>
<p>Implementing the Results of the Ministry of Education's Discussion on Implementing Compulsory Education. Private School Teachers Who Have Been Surveyed Will Not Participate in Registration.</p>
<p>The City Social Bureau has surveyed a total of 452 private schools in the city, and more than 30 reports are still being submitted continuously. The total number of students is nearly 20,000, and the special zone is not included. In order to save these students and enable them to receive a good education, it is necessary to rectify the private schools. Therefore, a general registration of private school teachers has been launched. Since the registration began on the 20th of this month, more than 200 people have registered. Private school teachers in the special zone can also go to register. Those private school teachers who have already been surveyed and do not carry out the registration procedures will be cancelled. After registration, district training will be held. All methods will be implemented in accordance with the results of the Ministry of Education's discussion on the implementation of compulsory education, taking into account the circumstances. In the future, training will focus on civic training and scientific common sense. The curriculum will include civic training, national language, arithmetic, common sense, knowledge for private school teachers, short-term primary school law, singing, and special lectures. The duration will be at least four weeks. In the future, private schools must divide into two semesters each year, breaking the old practice of dividing into three terms a year. The minimum equipment for each school must include a portrait of the Prime Minister and the national flag, school plaque, desks and chairs, blackboard, chalk, clock, bell, spittoon, washbasin, towel, application charts, etc. Private school teachers must also participate in the primary school education research associations in each district.

<h3>The China-Poland Cultural Association</h3>
<p>Compiling Historical Materials on Cultural Exchanges Between the Two Countries and Publishing a Special Collection of Papers on the Muni Pavilion Case</p>
<p>China and Poland had early cultural exchanges, as early as the 17th century. Zhang Yong (Zi Junzhi), a professor at Shandong University and a member of the China-Poland Cultural Association, has found that during the late Ming Dynasty, the Polish Jesuit Muni Pavilion (Nci-olas Smog1enski) came to China and imparted his mathematical expertise, introducing "logarithms" to China. His disciples at the time included Xue Fengzuo (Zichuan), who wrote "Comprehensive Understanding of the Calendar," and Fang Zhongtong, who wrote "Derivation of Degrees," both of which can be found in "Biography of Mathematicians" and "Biography of Jesuits" by Fist and other books. Mr. Zhang has extensive research in the history of mathematics, history, and textual criticism. He plans to compile "The Muni Pavilion Case" in addition to teaching. The contents are divided into three chapters: (1) Muni's Chronology, (2) Xue Fengzuo's Case, (3) The Fang Yizhi and Son's Cases of Tongcheng. It will be published by the China-Poland Association as a special publication in the China-Poland Cultural Series. The association has already solicited information on Muni's affairs before coming to China from Polish relations and the historians of mathematics for reference. After the book is published, it will further enhance the close cultural relationship between China and Poland.</p>

<h3>Opening of Huai Cheng Kindergarten</h3>
<p>Ms. Sang Wenlan, who used to run the Teng Peifu Kindergarten (boarding nursery) in Jiangwan, is kind and caring in educating children, and takes good care of them, with a persistent spirit. She has gained the trust of people in society. In less than two years, the number of students has increased from seven or eight to forty or fifty, and there are even more who came later and missed the opportunity. Last year, Ms. Sang left the kindergarten for personal reasons. The parents of the students believed that Ms. Sang was the only talent in the new nursery business, and earnestly requested her to establish a nursery organization in Shanghai to avoid the risk of the children in the kindergarten losing care and education. Ms. Sang readily agreed, and with the support of enthusiastic people in society, established Huai Cheng Kindergarten. Recently, she found a Western-style building at No. 5, Lane 225, Luban Road, in the French Concession (telephone 281399). The building is spacious, clean, and has complete sanitary facilities, and there is a large lawn. It is truly a rare paradise for children in Shanghai. The kindergarten is now ready, and registration will begin immediately. In addition to the more than twenty existing students, there are reportedly more than twenty vacancies. Those who have special needs or children who want to receive complete education can directly contact the kindergarten or ask for the articles of association.</p>
<h3>Several Issues Concerning English Teaching in Secondary Education (I)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shijie</p>
<p>Lecture on the Central Broadcasting Station on January 26</p>
<p>Listeners,</p>
<p>Today, the Chinese Western Language Society is holding a conference in Beiping. Attendees include teachers from universities and middle schools in various regions. The conference will last for three days, and the main topics discussed are related to universities and middle schools across the country. This is an important academic conference. I have been invited to say a few words today, so I will take this opportunity to discuss a topic related to the conference, namely, "Several Issues Concerning English Teaching in Secondary Education." Before discussing it, I have two simple statements. First, I am not discussing specialized topics from an expert's point of view. This is a matter for the conference itself, and I don't have time today. What I want to say is to discuss this issue based on the general policy of education. Second, the scope of secondary education is very broad, and what I am saying is only a part of the whole. Secondary education has its own overall nature and spirit, so today I have chosen this topic, put forward some more basic questions, and discuss them, and I will divide this topic into five sections.</p>
<p>First, secondary education should cultivate practical and applicable knowledge. In terms of school organization, secondary education can be divided into categories such as middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools. This is only for the convenience of training methods. They do have a common foundation, common principles, and common goals. The most obvious common foundation is that the standard age of students in these schools is almost exactly the same. This indicates that secondary education has a common foundation in the physiological development process of students. This is only the most basic and obvious kind of common foundation. The goal of secondary education is based on these common foundations, one of which is to cultivate students' knowledge. There is no difference of opinion on this point. However, the issue of knowledge is extremely broad in meaning, extremely complex in content, and progresses with the times. In today's China, under the current world knowledge situation, in running secondary education, what kind of knowledge should be cultivated, to what extent should it be cultivated, and what methods should be used to cultivate it to achieve the best results? Here, everyone's opinions are bound to be very different. Since the problem is generally recognized as so important, we seem to have a deep understanding of it, a firm belief, a consistent proposition, and thorough efforts. China has been running secondary education for decades. There have been many reforms in various aspects during this period. Today, generally speaking, compared to the past, there has indeed been considerable progress, but in other aspects, there are also many unsatisfactory things that everyone has felt. One of them is that many students who have received secondary education cannot apply the knowledge they learned in school after entering society. Only after they graduate do they realize that what they have learned does not meet the needs of society and cannot make a living in society, leading to unemployment. The knowledge needed in society, generally speaking, follows the path of division of labor and cooperation. Each profession has its own knowledge and skills, which must also be quite proficient. Not only is this the case for more specialized careers, such as industry and commerce, but even more so for more ordinary occupations, which also require considerable unique knowledge. However, the biggest problem with knowledge for Chinese students and education managers is that they despise practicality. The reason for this is not very clear. Perhaps it is because the effectiveness of practical knowledge is limited, and it is relatively narrow. Just like a practical tool, it is limited and can only be applied to one job, not to many jobs at the same time. I will now give a few examples. Often, a student can explain the great truths of natural selection and survival of the fittest in biology books, but when they go to the wilderness and see the phenomena of the biological world, such as birds flying and animals running, they do not understand as much as a farmer. The activities of these birds and animals have the same meaning as his own hard work for a living. This metaphor is not too much. Obviously, one knowledge is practical, and one knowledge is not practical. For example, many students often see the terms of weights and measures in mathematics or physics, but in real life, they do not know how long a meter is or how heavy a kilogram is. They know many plant and animal names in books, but they do not know the names and habits of the trees in their own gardens or the birds and animals in the local fields. The teaching materials and teaching methods of secondary schools are accustomed to abstraction and do not pay enough attention to practicality. Students who have received such education cannot completely complain about society if they are not welcomed by society after graduation. The situation of unemployment among graduates is probably quite common. Although there are no reliable statistics on the employment situation of secondary school and university graduates, some situations can be seen from one thing. Some time ago, the government ran a university graduate employment training class, the reason being that thousands of university graduates were unable to make a living on their own and had to be trained separately. That training class was only for university graduates in the last three years or so. If all university graduates over the years are included, the number is certainly more than this. If a training class is also run for secondary school graduates in this way, the number would probably have to be multiplied many times. Of course, this situation is not entirely the responsibility of the students, but is also a part of the entire problem in society. However, the fact that many educated students cannot even make a minimum living on their own is a great loss for both those running schools and those seeking education. If a country wants to revive, it must be able to do everything in its administration. Currently, in China's construction industry, the lack of practical talent is felt in every aspect. When educated people encounter practical problems, they often feel unable to cope. This lack of practical talent has a great impact on the country's future and should be effectively remedied. The remedy, of course, is still education. Both higher education and secondary education should make students' knowledge practical, and it should start with secondary education. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton</h3>
<p>Future Yarn: Mostly Hedging</p>
<p>Releasing February and Adding Long-Term Positions; Dealers Still Short</p>
<p>The yarn market rose in the morning but weakened at noon, but the momentum was still strong because Indian merchants still held long positions and continued to drag in and add more. However, some followers slightly settled. Dealers, seeing that the yarn factories were all running at full capacity, working day and night to manufacture, and the production volume greatly increased, and the third-grade yarn market also fell back, so their thoughts tended to sell. However, coarse yarn and the Guangdong gang suddenly became aggressive, and the market was agitated by them.</p>
<p>Changfeng and Gengfeng Were the Best Sellers in the Afternoon; Future Yarn Opened Higher. The market opened higher, with all months rising together. The delivery price of Grade A or higher yarn for the January period was firm and high. At the same time, Southern buyers of spot yarn were particularly enthusiastic, and people's hearts became firmer. The long side began to hedge, releasing February and adding long-term positions. Therefore, the rise in long-term prices also started. However, the price of Osaka third-grade yarn fell step by step, and the spot yarn price fell even more sharply by four to ten yuan. However, this port was not affected in the slightest. As a result, all months of future yarn rose by 1.4 to 1.2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The market situation was flat when the market opened in the afternoon. Suddenly, the market fell by 1.1 to 3.7 yuan because the Osaka third-grade yarn telegraph kept falling, and dealers sold. However, the long side had both entries and exits. By the third closing, it was heard that the spot yarn business was not bad, and it returned to the same level. As a result, all months fell by 2, 3, and 9 cents compared to the morning closing price. Changnong, Gengfeng, and Dachangcheng sold in the morning and bought in the afternoon. After checking, Shenyi sold 3,550 bales, Dafeng 800 bales, Jinchang 3,350 bales, Ruida 2,250 bales, Senkang 750 bales, Xiacheng 1,100 bales, Tonghe 1,400 bales, Daqing 1,000 bales, Yichang 2,250 bales, Fukang 1,200 bales. Yuhuo bought 5,750 bales, Shenji 1,250 bales, Changyu 1,000 bales, Fengtai 2,000 bales, Shenji 1,600 bales, Renfeng 1,600 bales, Wang Taixing 1,460 bales, Hengchang 1,150 bales, Changfeng 3,000 bales, Dachang 1,300 bales, Yongda 1,150 bales, and Xincheng 1,500 bales. The highest prices during the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Improved; Raw Cotton Remains Stable</p>
<p>Quick Covering Was Very Urgent in the Morning</p>
<p>The cotton market started to rise and then fell, and the trend was still mediocre. The Indian and American cotton markets were still in a state of stagnation, and people's hearts were flat. However, with the improvement in yarn sales, raw materials should be able to stabilize one step, and the sources of supply from various routes are turning to decline, because the flower shops have mostly stopped weighing and closed at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Future Cotton Rose in the Morning but Retraced in the Afternoon. The future cotton market opened higher, with all months rising slightly. Because the yarn market turned higher, the spot yarn sales market was slightly better. Factories may have the possibility of purchasing raw materials, and floating households were particularly eager to replenish their cotton. However, the Indian and American cotton markets were still scattered and weak, and the Osaka third-grade offset fell by 6.7 cents. As a result, all months of future cotton rose by 2.5 to 4 cents compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the market opened in the afternoon, it suddenly fell by 2 cents, and the market situation was particularly lax. As the Osaka third-grade cotton fell frequently, and the spot cotton business was very clear, buyers lacked. As a result, all months fell by 2 to 2.5 cents compared to the morning closing price. Meiji sold 1,000 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, Xiacheng 1,100 dan, Yongda 1,400 dan, Dafeng 1,000 dan, Jinchang 1,100 dan, and Fengtai 1,900 dan. Tongji bought 4,700 dan, Gengfeng 4,700 dan, Yuan 2,600 dan, Yichang 1,000 dan, Runkang 1,100 dan, Ruida 1,000 dan, and Wang Taixing 1,300 dan. The highest and lowest prices during the day are listed on the left.</p>
<p>Only Yao Cotton Is Traded for Spot Cotton. The consumption of spot cotton has turned silent, and the factories' appetite is not good. The source of Yao cotton is 400 bales, and the source of Tong cotton is 393 bales.</p>
<p>Rumor: Six-Month Contract System for Yarn and Cotton to Be Restored</p>
<p>This Month's Contract Only Allowed to Close Out; New Trading Allowed for the Other Five Months</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange's standard yarn and cotton market used to trade six-month futures. Last year, the market price of yarn and cotton狂刊猛降 changed several times a day. In order to crack down on speculation, the contract period was shortened from November 6 last year, and only five-month contracts were traded. Therefore, by December 1, only four-month contracts remained, and only four dates were allowed to be traded, which has been the case until now. However, all parties deeply felt that this restriction was inconvenient and tried every means to restore the six-month contract. Rumor has it that the proposed method for restoring the six-month contract is that this month's contract will only be allowed to close out, while the remaining five months will still be allowed to be traded. For example, starting in February, if a six-month contract is traded, it can be traded until the July contract. Once in February, the original February futures are only allowed to close out and are not allowed to be traded. The launch of speculative frenzy is all due to the squeezing of shorts and longs in this month's contract. If this month's contract is only closed out, speculators will have one less tool. As such, it is recorded for reference.</p>
<p>American Cotton Affected by Sales of Pledged Cotton</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, the market situation was not active, and all months fell by one to four pound coins. Dealers are studying the differences in the grade of pledged cotton. The consensus is that the difference in this grade will make the market price higher than the selling price. Therefore, it is also difficult to sell out the pledged cotton for a while. However, the content is not so simple, so the impact on the market price in the market is very small. Afterwards, due to poor news from Liverpool, overnight longs closed out, and the market price was weak. Fortunately, before the close, dealers bought nearby months, and some recovered. It is estimated that the spot price rose by one pound coin, the futures price rose by one pound coin to a shortage of five pound coins. English cotton spot fell by four points, and futures fell by three points. Indian cotton rose initially due to the strength of the stock market, and exporters and shorts bought in. Then, it returned due to the unrest in the Japanese political situation. Finally, due to the interpretation of the details of the American pledged cotton, which was beneficial to the buyer, the market price rose again. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by half a rupee, Aomu La rose by 0.29 rupee, and Bairoxi rose by 0.5 to 0.75 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegram dated 25th)</p>
<p>According to the Mumbai telegram, the forecast for the opening on the 20th was Bairoxi at 225 rupees, Aomu La at 204.5 rupees, up 0.75 rupee, and Pingguoer at 176 rupees, up 0.5 rupee.</p>
<p>Last Week's Cotton Exports from Rangoon</p>
<p>According to a Mumbai telegram on the 25th, the total amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 1,42 tons, of which 625 tons went to Osaka, 679 tons went to Zhonghu, 18 tons went to Yokohama, and 89 tons went to Dalian.</p>
<p>Third-Grade Yarn and Cotton Futures and Spot Prices Both Fell</p>
<p>According to an Osaka telegram on the 26th, spot yarn fell by 1 to 10 yuan, 16-count fan surface yarn was 246 yuan, down 4 yuan, 20-count goldfish yarn was 268 yuan, down 1 yuan, 40-count five-star yarn was 400 yuan, down 12 yuan, and 42-count pheasant yarn was 390 yuan, down 5 yuan. Third-grade yarn futures fell by 3.7 to 6 yuan per cent, with nearby months at 255.3 yuan and distant months at 247.8 yuan. Cotton futures fell by 0.6 to 1.3 yuan, with nearby months at 74.25 yuan and distant months at 75.7 yuan.</p>

<p>March Government Bonds Debut Today</p>
<p>Only February Was Traded Yesterday; Volume Reduced and Market Prices Varied Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, only February futures trading was traded for government bonds. The market situation was quiet, and major long and short players rarely made moves. The trading floor was purely for retail investors to close out their positions. The market price fell slightly as the long side made some sales. However, the market sentiment was extremely stable. The March futures will begin trading today, and there should be a lively atmosphere in the future. When the market opened yesterday morning, retail investors made quite a few purchases due to stable sentiment. Grades E and D rose by 5 cents to 2 corners. By the time of the inner grades, the long side emerged and surged, and a lot of No. 43 was sold, and the market price was slightly down by 5 cents to 1 corner. The market prices in the second session were all stable, and the volume also decreased. Only grades C and A rose slightly, and the rest were equal to the previous session. When the market opened in the afternoon, there were few transactions. Major players slightly acquired with Nos. 11 and 77, and No. 47 had more sales. The market price was slightly down by 5 cents per corner. The closing trend was still relatively strong, but because retail investors bought and sold chaotically, the market price varied by only 5 cents. As a result, grades D and A were slightly better by 5 cents per corner, while grades E, inner, and B were slightly down by 5 cents to 1 and a half corners. The total trading volume was estimated to be 1,745,000 yuan. The comparison of the rise and fall is listed in the table on the left. (Unit: Yuan, Trading Unit: Hundreds of Yuan)</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Silk Transactions Depend on Indian Firms</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese and American silk markets have repeatedly reported declines, making exports from this port even more depressed. Yesterday, current and forward goods on the New York Stock Exchange fell by 1.5 points each, a huge difference of 1 jiao and 4.5 points from the price of 2.12 yuan at the beginning of this month. The Yokohama silk market saw a drop of 8 yuan for spot goods and 3 yuan for futures. Lyon Japanese silk fell by 0.25 francs. Shanghai silk B rose by 0.5 francs. There were no changes in other silk products. In the local silk market, foreign firms and white silk mills saw quiet trading. User silk sales were low because the end of the year was approaching, and silk weaving factories were about to stop work for the New Year. Therefore, there were fewer purchases. Indian firms' purchases of Reeled Tussah, bleached white silk were still profitable. For example, Zhuan Li Jin Niao was sold at 680 yuan, a rise of 15 yuan compared to the previous price. Other Shuang Gong County Jiaxing threads also rose accordingly.</p>
<p>Green Tea Exports Are Booming</p>
<p>Last year, foreign firms' sales of Canton Green Tea were unusually rapid. Qining Black Tea was cleared early. The various kinds of green tea from Lujiang Pingshui and local firms currently have only a thousand boxes remaining. Most of the warehouses, such as Hongyuan Yongxing Longsheng Changsheng, have been completely sold out. The speed of sales has been rare in recent years. Recently, due to the high volume of tea sales abroad and the imminent closing date, firms such as Xiehe, Yihua, Tongfu, and Jinjiang are actively handling delivery procedures. It is estimated that more than 8,000 boxes of green tea will be shipped out within days.</p>
<h3>Textiles</h3>
<p>Frequent Telegrams from Abroad Indicate That Woolen Cloth Is Rising Unceasingly</p>
<p>The textile market has recently shown signs of sluggishness. Sellers are willing to make concessions on thick goods, while they want to raise prices on thin goods. This is because the year-end sales are approaching, and long-distance customers have already inquired about transactions. The number of orders placed by foreign firms has been reduced because raw wool prices continue to rise, and telegrams from factories abroad frequently indicate price increases, making it impossible to finalize prices. For example, if a firm opens a price of 5 shillings for goods, the Rong family fixes the counter-offer at 4 shillings and 8 pence. But the factory's machinists telegraphed back that they wanted 5 shillings and 2 pence. After negotiations, customers were willing to go as high as 9 shillings and send a telegram, but the reply was that they wanted 5 shillings and 4 pence. As a result, the business of ordering goods from below has been decreasing day by day.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods</h3>
<p>Guangdong Longan Vendors Call for Price Increases</p>
<p>The Longan produced in Lianzhou, Nanhai, and Hainan in Guangdong has recently seen land prices tighten. Vendors are unwilling to continue offering their existing goods at the original prices and are calling for price increases across the board. It seems that unless prices increase before the year-end, they will not be reopened. The spring market is expected to be promising.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market</h3>
<p>More Than 16,000 Bags of Coarse Granulated Sugar Arrived</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market remained weak. The association's price for current spot goods of No. 24 coarse granulated sugar was 23.15 yuan, and transit goods were 7.5 yuan, both down slightly by 0.1 jiao. Dongbai was down slightly by 0.05 yuan to 0.1 jiao. No. 4 spot goods were 23.25 yuan, No. 8 was 22.8 yuan, No. 9 YRO was 22.45 yuan, transit was 7.5 yuan, No. 4 was 8.15 yuan, and No. 8 was 7.85 yuan. Cotton white sugar from this factory was also down by 0.1 jiao. Banji No. 1 was 22 yuan jiao, No. 2 was 21.8 jiao, No. 3 was 21.5 jiao, jiao hao was 21.2 jiao, No. 5 was 20.9 jiao. Jinxin Dahua No. 1 was 22.2 jiao, and No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 each decreased by 0.2 jiao per grade. Only the Chao gang opened dozens of bags of Chongti Qing, at 14.1 jiao. Foreign sugar had 2,510 bags of coarse granulated white sugar arriving on the Zhisun Huoli wheel, and 14,014 bags of coarse granulated white sugar arriving on the Zhishadan Ni wheel.</p>
<h3>Food</h3>
<p>Manufacturers Temporarily Recalled This Month's Flour, and Afternoon Prices Rebounded</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market presented a rather chaotic picture. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat in the morning was stable, the Chicago wheat market opened steadily, followed by unfavorable weather and a firm foreign market. Prices gradually rose, and the closing price rose 0.0375 to 0.075, equivalent to a good 0.12 to 0.23 yuan in national currency for Canada. However, market sentiment, in view of the numerous difficulties this month, also inevitably turned soft for the forward period. Because this month is the last day of trading, non-industry speculative buyers originally wanted to take delivery, but the goods received cannot be delivered again next month. Therefore, they abandoned taking delivery and frequently returned them. Therefore, the initial opening was still at 0.083, and later it fell to as low as 0.08025. At the same time, the selling pressure was stronger for the various forward months, and they all fell by 0.02. The difference between this month and February was as large as 0.08, but it could not attract outside speculation. This was because they could not be delivered again next month. By the time the afternoon session opened, the initial trend was still flat and soft, but this month's fluctuations were quite large. Because the delivering manufacturers saw that the market price was low and wanted to recall the goods, and the amount of short covering was no longer large, there was a temporary situation of more demand than supply. By the third round, it actually rebounded to 0.086, and at the close, it returned to 0.02. The forward market also initially showed weakness, and then also slightly recovered, still falling about 0.02 compared to the previous day. According to industry insiders, if actual sales do not rise in the future, the near term will be hit first.</p>
<p>Transaction Statistics for Miscellaneous Grains in the 25th Year (1)</p>
<p>Grain price statistics are of great reference value at a time when the national grain problem is deepening, and changes in market prices and the amount of transactions are increasing. Therefore, this newspaper is not afraid of seeking details and will list the highest and lowest prices of various grains in the 25th year, along with the number of transactions over the year. However, there are some weaknesses in this: ㊀ Our country's agricultural products have no grade standards or trademarks, so the types are complex and difficult to count. Currently, only wheat is being graded by official and commercial cooperation. ㊁ The place of origin of goods is often mixed and broad in the market. For example, the goods transported from the east of the Jinpu Railway, the north of the Yangtze River, and the south of Lianyungang are all referred to as "Jiangbei" by ordinary merchants. Another example is the products of various counties in Jiangxi Province, which are shipped to Shanghai by wheel in Jiujiang, and are referred to as Jiujiang XXX goods. This kind of thing is too numerous to count, so it is difficult to distinguish the exact place of origin, resulting in the same name but different quality, deceiving oneself and others, often.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>Yes, ㊂ It is difficult to have accurate and public figures on the source of arrival and the amount of written text in the market. Industry insiders only know a rough idea of one or two private individuals and strictly guard the secrets. The bad habit of keeping secrets has not been broken so far. In fact, there is no need to have any secrets in these places. Publicizing each other has a check and balance. This kind of anti-era mentality is a major obstacle to business development, and it is still a pity to adhere to bad habits. I deeply hope that the industry leaders will lead the producers, transporters, and general distributors to supervise each other and correct them one by one, so as to avoid the giant of the "agricultural country" and end up being so backward. The table is as follows (from January 3 to December 31 of the 25th year of the Republic of China, due to the limited space in this column, it cannot be published all at once, and readers are expected to understand.)</p>
<p>Canton Firms Actively Purchase Milled and Raw Early Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Canton market for Early Rice was very strong. The whole market purchased a large amount of milled and raw rice, reaching 40,000 bags. The intake was very high, and there may be a need to continue to actively purchase in the later market. The market was quite active yesterday, with most of the transactions taking place in the South City. Among them, more than 20,000 were handled by Wanxing Rice Firm. However, as the end of the year is approaching, most of the cargo owners are eager to sell, and some are selling at reduced prices. Therefore, Canton firms took the opportunity to actively purchase without raising prices. Although the market was active, the market price remained flat.

<p>The Sales of Heshang Rice Are All Moving</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the total amount of goods from various gangs was more than 60, with a total of 13,230 shi. Among them, there were 26 or 27 Thin Rice gangs. The sales market on this street was slightly better than before, and the appetite for steamed buns also increased. It is estimated that Tianjin Qingyan Henan and other gangs handled more than 4,000 bags. However, the source of arrival was large, and the market situation was stable. Therefore, the market prices of thick and thin rice were all stable, and Du Yangjian and Yinbian Yuan were also stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were only 18 or 19 boats from various places in Hexia. There were continued transactions of goods in the market for those who took advantage. The market situation was stable for white rice in the early market, and it tightened by nearly a jiao in the afternoon.

<p>Foreign Firms' Sesame Fell by Two Jiao</p>
<p>Soybean Sales Are Still Active</p>
<p>Recently, foreign firms' sesame has been weak due to the weak market abroad, causing dealers to decline for three consecutive days. Yesterday, the cargo owner made concessions and lowered prices to drive sales, but foreign firms are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. Only the Central Trust Bureau traded 400 tons, with the price opening at 14.9 yuan, a drop of 0.2 jiao from the previous market. If the sales appetite is not good, it may need to be revised again. Although Dalian soybeans have fallen frequently, the sentiment in this city is still stable. Transactions were slightly more active than in the previous two days. It is estimated that 100 bags of Xicheng beans, 5 cars of Tieling beans, 1 car of Xuzhou beans, 50 bags of Pinghu beans, 300 bags of Dingjiazhou beans, 1 car of Fanjia Village beans, and 1,500 bags of winter beans, 304, went to oil mills, oil heads, and inland areas on this street.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Banking Circles Jointly Form a Rice and Grain Collateral Banking Group</h3>
<p>A total of 4 million yuan undertaken by 16 banks. The contract was officially signed and implemented yesterday.</p>
<p>Due to the inability of Hunan rice to be continuously transported to Guangdong and the manipulation by general rice merchants, a panic situation has arisen in Guangdong's grain supply. As a result of negotiations between the Guangdong Provincial Government and the Shanghai-Guangdong banking circles, it was decided that the Shanghai-Guangdong banking circles would jointly organize a rice and grain collateral banking group, changing the credit loans to mortgage loans. The total amount of collateral is 4 million yuan. The contract has already been signed and implemented yesterday. A reporter from Xin Xin News learned the details from participating banks as follows:</p>
<p>Organizational Process: Since the governments of Hunan and Guangdong provinces decided on economic cooperation, the promotion of Hunan rice transportation to Guangdong, and the request for the banking circles to invest in handling export bill mortgage loans, various banks in Shanghai such as China, Communications, etc., had intended to jointly organize a national rice transportation and sales export bill mortgage banking group. However, the transportation of Hunan rice to Guangdong encountered difficulties due to the manipulation of rice merchants, causing the banking group's organization to be virtually suspended. Now, the Guangdong provincial government is facing a severe grain panic situation. As a result of negotiations between the Guangdong Provincial Food Regulation Committee and the banking circles, the credit loans for the rice transportation and sales methods previously ordered by the committee were changed to mortgage loans. A mortgage loan banking group was organized by the Shanghai-Guangdong banking circles to undertake rice and grain mortgages, and it was decided that the total mortgage amount would be 4 million yuan, to be undertaken by 16 banks including the Central Bank. The contract has already been signed in Guangdong and is scheduled to be implemented on January 26.</p>
<p>Amount Acknowledged by Each Bank: The amount acknowledged by each bank is as follows: Central Bank 800,000 yuan, Bank of China 630,000 yuan, Guangdong Bank 600,000 yuan, Communications Bank 500,000 yuan, Guangzhou Municipal Bank/Agricultural Bank each 200,000 yuan, Shanghai Bank/National Loan Bank each 150,000 yuan, Zhongnan/Salt Industry/Jincheng/Guohua/Guangdong/East Asia/Postal Savings Bureau/Guangxi, etc., eight banks each 100,000 yuan (of which Guangxi Bank is 100,000 Guangdong currency, equivalent to about 70,000 national currency). The total is 4 million yuan. The banking group is named "Guangdong Provincial Food Regulation Committee Rice and Grain Collateral Banking Group," and the Central Bank, Guangdong Provincial Bank, and Shanghai Bank are designated as the banking group's representatives, responsible for handling fundraising and lending matters.</p>
<p>Undertaking Collateral: In addition to the Guangdong Food Regulation Committee mortgaging the purchased grain to the banking group to borrow money, the banking group is responsible for all future transportation, procurement, and storage matters. At the same time, the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Communications will reduce transportation costs for national rice sold to Guangdong as much as possible, and the Yuehan Railway will allocate more vehicles to transport national rice to Guangdong. It is also learned that the Ministry of Finance's Grain Transportation and Sales Bureau is also purchasing national rice for transportation to Guangdong for promotion, so Guangdong's rice shortage will be completely resolved soon.</p>
<h3>Bank Withholding Method for Income Tax on Deposit Interest</h3>
<p>Two Methods to Preferentially Treat Depositors and Protect Privacy</p>
<p>Shenshi News Agency reports that after the levying of income tax, the Shanghai Banking Association has repeatedly studied the procedures and implementation methods for levying income tax on bank deposit interest, and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for adoption. Yesterday, a reporter from Shenshi News Agency learned that the Banking Association has recently determined two methods for withholding income tax on deposit interest from depositors: ㊀ In order to maintain the privacy of depositors, it has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval that only account numbers will be listed on the tax declaration form in the future, and not account names. ㊁ In order to treat depositors preferentially, all the handling fees that each bank should receive for tax collection will be allocated to the depositors. Starting from the beginning of this year, the interest on various deposits payable will be temporarily calculated at 96%. For example, if a depositor's interest income is 100 yuan and the tax payable is 5 yuan, the bank should receive a handling fee of 1% of the 5 yuan (according to the original handling fee of 0.5%, the Ministry of Finance has now agreed to increase it to 1%). Now, it is allowed to deduct this when paying taxes, and the remaining 4 yuan will be submitted to the tax bureau. However, the bank voluntarily gives up this portion and allocates it to the depositors, so the tax payable by depositors is 4 yuan per 100 yuan, reducing the burden to show preferential treatment. This demonstrates compliance with the law while safeguarding the interests of depositors, with excellent intentions. Official notifications have been issued to depositors to check, and distributed to counterparts in various provinces and cities to ensure uniformity.</p>
<h3>Yuehan Railway Bureau Borrows 5 Million Yuan from Bank of China</h3>
<p>Zhou Zhongqi Visited Song Ziwen Yesterday, and a Draft Agreement Has Been Negotiated</p>

Zhou Zhongqi, Deputy Director of the Yuehan Railway, came to Shanghai yesterday to visit Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Bank of China, to negotiate the matter. According to Zhou's conversation at the Bank of China, the Yuehan Railway Bureau will build large-scale warehouses in Hunan and Guangdong provinces to alleviate the rice shortage in Guangdong province, and borrow 5 million yuan from the Bank of China. For the purpose of jointly developing the national economic construction, this loan will not bear interest, and the warehouses will be used as collateral. Chairman Song has approved this, and a draft agreement has been made. Once he reports to the Ministry of Railways in Beijing tomorrow (i.e., today) and obtains approval, the contract can be officially signed.</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Participation from All Sectors in the Paris Exposition</h3>

<h3>Guangxi Comfort Mission to Suiyuan Passes Through Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mission Leader Xie Cangsheng Went to Nanjing Last Night</p>
<p>The Guangxi National Salvation Association's delegation to comfort the soldiers resisting the enemy in Suiyuan, consisting of Xie Cangsheng, Yi Fengying, Chen Fengyi, Meng Xianzheng, Meng Huikun, and others, led by Xie Cangsheng, departed from Guilin on the 2nd of this month. They traveled via the Guangdong-Hankou Railway to Hankou, and on the 10th, they headed north, carrying 20,000 yuan in cash, 34,400 pounds of biscuits and canned goods, 240 boxes of beef, 2,000 dozen socks, 2,600 dozen towels, and 170 dozen undershirts. They also carried a letter from Director Li Zongren to Director Yan Xishan, expressing gratitude. They went to the front lines to provide comfort and distribute supplies, which has already been completed. They passed through Shanghai the day before yesterday on their return journey to the south. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Letter from Li Zongren to Yan Xishan</p>
<p>The letter from Li Zongren to Yan Xishan reads: "Generalissimo Yan Xishan, When the Suiyuan war broke out, the whole country was outraged. Fortunately, thanks to your martial prowess and decisive command, the Bai Ling Temple was recaptured. The news spread like wildfire, greatly heartening the people. The people of the enemy province, thinking of the officers and soldiers at the front lines, striving to kill the enemy in the icy and snowy weather under a hail of bullets, are filled with admiration. We have specially organized a comfort mission, publicly recommending Xie Cangsheng to lead the mission members to Suiyuan, representing our comfort and expressing our admiration. I am writing this special letter of introduction, hoping to be granted an audience, and wishing you well. Looking north to the clouds, we eagerly await news of victory. With utmost respect, I wish you success and do not want to be overly formal. Your brother, Li Zongren."</p>
<p>The Mission's Journey to Suiyuan</p>
<p>According to Mission Leader Xie, the supplies that the mission brought to Suiyuan were well-received when distributed in the war zone. Director Yan also replied to Director Li, expressing his gratitude. The front lines in Suiyuan are currently very calm, and morale is quite high. After completing our work, we transferred to Qingdao and then came to Shanghai. The four mission members, Yi Fengying and others, are scheduled to take the Changxing Company's Japanese Empress liner to Hong Kong and return to Guangxi tomorrow (i.e., today). I will take a train to Nanjing at 4 PM tonight (i.e., last night) to meet with the Guangxi National Inspection Mission and will accompany them on inspections in various parts of North China.</p>
<h3>Stamp Duty on Company Registration Certificates Increased to Two Yuan This Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs recently received instructions from the Ministry of Industry, stating that the stamp duty for company registration certificates, which was previously one yuan, should be increased to two yuan. According to Article 13 of the Company Registration Rules, companies applying for certificates were required to pay a stamp duty of one yuan. However, on February 10th of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), the National Government promulgated the revised Stamp Tax Law, Article 16, Schedule of Tax Rates, Item 32, which stipulates that the stamp duty for business licenses of company organizations should be two yuan per license. Therefore, the stamp duty for company registration certificates should be changed to two yuan to comply with the regulations. It is hereby decided that from January of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), all company registration certificates will be affixed with a stamp duty of two yuan. The stamp duty fee paid by companies applying for registration and licenses will also be changed to two yuan, so as to legally affix the stamp. For registration certificates issued by the Ministry of Industry after February 10th of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) that were affixed with a stamp of one yuan, an additional one yuan should be affixed. After receiving the order, the Bureau has not only complied with it but also instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to inform and instruct all to comply.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Affixing Stamps on Account Books and Ledgers</h3>
<p>Taxation Department Replies to Municipal Chamber of Commerce: General Year-End Closing Shall be the Start and End Date</p>
<p>The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance replied to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Regarding your letter No. 259 Shangzi dated December 30th of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), requesting that the affixing of stamps on business account books and documents in the 25th year of the Republic (1936) be based on the customary general year-end closing as the start and end date, and that a notice be issued to prevent misunderstandings in the future, etc., We have investigated and approved the Ministry of Finance's statement in December of the 24th year of the Republic (1935). According to the regulations of the Stamp Tax Law, account books and ledgers should be affixed with a stamp of two jiao per year, so the validity of the stamp should end at the end of the Gregorian calendar's December. However, because businesses usually change account books and ledgers after the general business year-end closing, the detailed rules for implementing the Stamp Tax Law have clearly stipulated in Article 10 that the validity of the stamp for account books and ledgers should end on the date of the general business year-end closing, in order to show flexibility and facilitate matters," The Beiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce was instructed, and this approval document was entered into the "Collection of Cases and Examples of the Implementation of the Stamp Tax Law," Volume 3, and sent to all provinces for compliance. In accordance with the letter, we hereby reply and request that it be published.</p>

<h3>Difficult Overseas Chinese from Soviet Union Arrive in Shanghai on Northern Ship</h3>
<p>Totaling Three Hundred and Sixty-Two People</p>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the Russian ship "Northern" arrived in Shanghai yesterday, carrying 362 overseas Chinese compatriots who had been living in the Soviet Union.

<h3>Sanbei's Second New Ship, Long'an, Starts Service on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>First Voyage on the 29th</p>
<p>Details of the Sanbei Company's second new ship, the "Long'an," including its tonnage and dimensions, were previously published in the 6th issue of this newspaper. After the Sanbei Factory renovated the cabins, the dining hall and first and second-class cabins were beautifully decorated, comparable to the "Longxing" and "Longyu." The "Long'an" currently has ten dining halls, accommodating 30 people, six first-class cabins accommodating 12 people, eleven second-class cabins accommodating 44 people, and 150 sleeping berths in third class. The fourth-class cabin can accommodate six to seven hundred people. Because the empty ship has a draft of only seven feet and two inches, it is best suited for sailing during the current low-water period. While ships from other companies cannot navigate the upper Yangtze River smoothly, the "Long'an" can load enough cargo to travel as usual. The ship is scheduled to make its first voyage to Hankou on the 29th of this month (i.e., Friday). Afterwards, it will depart every Tuesday and Friday, making it the most outstanding vessel in Sanbei Company's regular Yangtze River service. The prices for each class of cabin are the same as the express ship "Longxing."</p>

<h3>The China Merchants Bureau Discriminates Against Employees in Dismissal from Wharf Management Department</h3>
<p>Severance Pay Issued as Usual</p>
<p>The State-Owned China Merchants Bureau's Wharf Management Department conducted screenings of staff at each wharf in December of last year. On the 26th of the same month, the department ordered each wharf to inform unqualified staff of their dismissals. These employees went to the department yesterday to request severance pay, double pay for previous years, and pay for January of this year as compensation. It has been learned that the department has issued pay for January of this year, but due to legal restrictions, it was unable to grant other requests. All other requests have been granted as usual, and employees have received them accordingly.</p>
<h3>Research Association for Income Tax Accounting Issues</h3>
<p>Leaders from All Industries Initiate Organization, Meeting to be Held This Afternoon</p>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, leaders from various industries in Shanghai, such as Luo Qinghua and He Yuanming, have initiated the organization of the Shanghai Income Tax Accounting Issue Research Association, and a founders' meeting will be held at 2:00 PM today at the Bingzi Society at the intersection of Second Malu and Yunnan Road. Yesterday, a special circular was sent to the industry associations in the city, requesting them to send representatives to participate and discuss everything. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Circular to All Industries: The original text reads, "We, the undersigned, are aware that income tax has begun to be levied on all industries. All of our companies, businesses, banks, factories, or individuals with capital of more than 2,000 yuan have an obligation to pay taxes. At this time when the new tax is being levied, people in all industries are paying close attention. However, there are many accounting issues related to this tax, and the taxation procedures are extremely cumbersome and the calculation methods are very complex. Therefore, we should have a deep understanding of the system and implementation methods. We are proposing to organize the Shanghai Income Tax Accounting Issue Research Association and have scheduled a meeting at 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month at the Bingzi Society, No. 4 Cishu Lane, at the intersection of Second Malu and Yunnan Road to discuss all the proceedings. If you agree, please send representatives to participate on time. We greatly look forward to it. To XX Industry Association."</p>

<h3>Chinese Laborers Building Roads in the Public Concession to Hold Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Organizing a Workers' Mutual Aid Association, Shanghai Federation Calls for Support</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Chinese laborers building roads for the Public Concession's Public Works Department have been in a state of panic recently because the department has implemented cost-cutting measures and announced that a large number of them will be laid off at the end of this month. They have been seeking assistance from various institutions and organizations for days, requesting assistance. This was reported in yesterday's newspaper. It has been learned that the workers are planning to hold a representatives' meeting this afternoon to organize a road construction workers' mutual aid association to fight for their rights and protect their livelihoods. At the same time, the First Special District Citizens' Federation also sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, calling for support. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from Shanghai Federation: The First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, stating, "According to a joint petition from Li Jingchun and other representatives of road construction workers in the Public Concession (original text omitted), etc. Therefore, we have investigated that your department's implementation of cost reduction and layoffs was originally a measure of last resort in the face of financial difficulties. However, the excellent treatment of foreign staff is quite wasteful and has been repeatedly requested by taxpayers to be strictly reduced, but has not been accepted. Facts show us that if one foreign senior staff member can be dismissed, his salary can maintain the livelihoods of dozens or even hundreds of laborers serving the municipal administration of the Concession. If the salaries of all foreign senior staff members are universally reduced, it would not be difficult to maintain the livelihoods of thousands of laborers. It is a pity that your department does not have the courage to implement this reasonable policy. Observing from another fact, the roads in the Concession are becoming longer and longer due to road construction beyond the boundaries, and the number of vehicles using them has also increased compared to before. All of this indicates that there is absolutely no need to lay off workers. Based on the above, we hereby request that you consider the plight of the laborers and the past contributions of Chinese workers to the municipal administration of the Concession, and quickly withdraw your order. We eagerly await your response."</p>
<p>Organizing a Mutual Aid Association: There are more than 1,000 Chinese laborers building roads for the Public Works Department of the Public Concession. Since hearing that the department will lay off a large number of them and switch to temporary hiring, they have been in a state of panic. In addition to seeking assistance from various parties for days, they have also scheduled a meeting of all workers' representatives this afternoon to organize a mutual aid association to fight for their rights. It is reported that the name has been determined to be the "Shanghai Public Concession Road Construction Workers' Mutual Aid Association," demanding that the department withdraw its order and not reduce wages in order to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<h3>Tooth and Bone Industry Workers Resuming Work This Morning</h3>
<p>Requesting All Matters Await Mediation</p>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, more than 400 workers in the city's tooth and bone crafts industry declared a joint strike yesterday, demanding that the employers increase wages and fulfill the agreed labor-management contract. They sent representatives to petition the party and government organs and the General Labor Union, requesting assistance. The Municipal Party Department stated that the workers' strike was inappropriate because it had not been submitted for mediation in advance. They were advised to resume work first and then formally mediate. Yesterday, the workers still did not resume work. The Municipal General Labor Union, fearing that the labor unrest would be prolonged and affect public order, immediately ordered the tooth and bone crafts industry labor union to inform the striking workers to resume work immediately. After receiving the order, the union decided to resume work this morning to show its acceptance of the higher-level order. The union's announcement is recorded below. The announcement reads, "The case in which the members of this union stopped work because they were dissatisfied with the employers' failure to implement the agreed price has been investigated by the union. It has been determined that some stores have not implemented it, and the industry association should provide more practical assistance. At this time when the country is striving for good governance, labor-management cooperation is especially urgent. In addition to forwarding the case to the party and government organs for legal resolution and dispatching members to mediate, we hereby order your union to order all workers to resume work immediately and await the resolution of this union with the party and government organs. Do not disobey. This order." After receiving this, the union immediately forwarded and announces it. It is announced for the information of all workers to strictly abide by the order, immediately resume work, and await mediation. Do not hesitate to avoid blame. This announcement is made.</p>
<h3>Feng Yangshan and Others Telegraph Report on Disaster Relief Situation in Damiao</h3>
<p>Disaster Situation is Lighter than in Bailingmiao</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association received a telegram yesterday from the association's standing committee member Feng Yangshan and Yang Zigong, reporting on the disaster relief situation in the Damiao area. The telegram reads, "To the Shanghai Yunnan Road Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, We have already telegraphed the situation in Bailingmiao. Fen and other members of the team, Yan, Cao, Shi, and Li, left Bailingmiao on the day of the sheep and inspected the temples of Hatongmiao, Damiao, and arrived at the Wangfu temples of the Fourth Banner late at night. Because they have not experienced severe warfare, the damage is lighter than in Bailingmiao. There are 318 lamas in Damiao who have been affected by the disaster, four of whom were killed and three were injured by airplane bombs. Relief will be distributed according to the Bailingmiao example, including 100 yuan for the living Buddha of the temple, for a total of 1,204 yuan in relief funds. In addition to Damiao, there are three other lama temples that have also suffered losses. Many people in the territory of Jiesumu in the Fourth Banner have also been affected by the disaster, and personnel have been sent to investigate and provide relief. On the day of the sheep, we left the Fourth Banner to inspect Ulanhua and arrived in Wuchuan at night. The disaster relief personnel are currently checking and distributing relief tickets in the Fourth District of Wuchuan. In addition to ordering them to actively carry out the work, we returned to Gui Sui yesterday and hereby report. Yang Mingsheng, Feng Xuefen, together bow."</p>

<h3>Special Cash Guarantee Method</h3>
<p>Bankers' Association Published the Full Text</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the banking sector, in order to improve the guarantee system, created a special cash guarantee method. After detailed research and discussion by the Bankers' Association, under the order of the Ministry of Industry, it was considered complete, sound, and practical. Therefore, various banks have planned to adopt it, and it is heard that several banks will implement it soon. The system was planned by Tang Shoumin, the General Manager of the Bank of Communications, and Wang Weisi, the Secretary and Personnel Section Chief of the bank. It has been praised by all sectors. The full text of the method, as published by the Bankers' Association, is as follows:</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>The current employee guarantee system in Chinese banks all adopt individual insurance policies. Before employees take office, they find a guarantor, fill out an insurance policy, and are only allowed to proceed with their duties after a review and approval. This has been a long-standing practice with a certain degree of effectiveness in the simple social structures of the past. However, in today's changing circumstances, the drawbacks have increased and disputes have arisen. This type of personnel guarantee system urgently needs to be reformed, which is a common feeling among colleagues. Examining the current reform of the guarantee system, the most advocated is to change the unlimited guarantee into a limited guarantee. For a limited guarantee, the limit of the guarantee must be defined. If it is too high, it is frightening and difficult to find a guarantor. If it is too low, the protection is insufficient and the risk is greater. Moreover, the duties of each person change from time to time, and the financial responsibilities vary before and after. It is impossible to change the limit of the guarantee according to the duties. Therefore, this kind of compromise reform method does not fundamentally solve the difficulty of guarantees. As for the employee credit insurance prevalent in European and American countries, it has been studied in detail. Due to the differences in salary levels at home and abroad and the exchange rate relationship, the procedures seem complicated and the rate is too high. The annual premium is too large. According to the practice of credit insurance companies in the United States, if a foreign country insures with them, due to overseas loss expenses, such as investigation and sorting out commissions and miscellaneous expenses, the premium must be increased. Therefore, in addition to paying the original premium, policyholders in Europe and Asia must pay additional fees. If there are a large number of people, the amount is also considerable. Under the current situation in our country, there are many obstacles to imitate. After repeated consideration, we believe that the guarantee system cannot be thoroughly improved unless the human guarantee is abolished. Therefore, we propose to recommend the "Special Cash Guarantee Method", using "cooperation between banks and employees" and "mutual insurance" as means to achieve the purpose of "diversifying risks" and "preventing fraud", embodying the beauty of "savings" and adopting the spirit of "insurance". The result can be "self-reliance" and "self-government and governance of people", which seems more practical and reasonable than the old-fashioned insurance policy system, and easier to implement and more cost-effective than the credit insurance system. The motivation for the reform and the detailed plan are described in detail below:</p>
<p>Reasons for Abolishing the Current Guarantee System</p>
<p>Any system must be a product of adapting to the social environment of an era. Therefore, if the system does not evolve with the environment, it will lose the ability to adapt to the environment, operate ineffectively, and cause conflicts. The old-fashioned employee insurance policy method is a product of the agricultural and handicraft era. Applying it to the economically complex and complex industrial and commercial era is inevitably stretched and impractical. We have summarized its shortcomings, roughly in several aspects:</p>
<p>1. From the Perspective of Banks</p>
<p>First, a bank should choose people for their abilities and recruit talents to serve the bank. However, there are often outstanding talents who lack a qualified guarantee. If it is too demanding, it is tantamount to shutting them out, which is a pity to miss talent. If it is accommodated, the guarantor will not be able to compensate once something goes wrong, and the bank will suffer a considerable loss.</p>
<p>Second, before an employee takes office, the bank must investigate the guarantor's family background. No matter how difficult it is to investigate thoroughly, even if the underlying circumstances can be understood, the personal and economic circumstances are constantly changing. Often, when guaranteeing someone, the family background is indeed solid, but after the employee's fraud occurs, the situation is no longer the same as before.</p>
<p>Third, those who have a considerable reputation in society may not actually have the financial capacity to act as a guarantor. If the bank refuses to provide such a personal guarantee, it indirectly hurts feelings. If it is reluctantly accepted, the guarantor's financial capacity is insufficient and the danger is worrying, making it difficult to advance or retreat.</p>
<p>Fourth, if the employee's guarantor can meet the standards, but at this time of rampant human desires, the seriousness of the fraud case often exceeds the guarantor's ability to compensate. The guarantor has the willingness to keep the guarantee responsibility, but cannot practically implement it. If the bank wants to add a complaint, it must go through legal judgment, involve in litigation for years, and the recovery is difficult to expect.</p>
<p>Fifth, if the guarantor has special power, it is very difficult for the bank to recover the losses when the compensation responsibility must be fulfilled. Even if it is sued, the guarantor will delay, shirk responsibility, and even ignore it.</p>
<p>Sixth, the current guarantee system must wait until fraud occurs before the guarantor contributes compensation. Therefore, it only passively seeks post-event remedies and cannot actively prevent in advance.</p>
<p>Seventh, for the guarantor of the new employee, the bank must conduct a detailed investigation. Even for the guarantor of the employee in office, the bank also has the practice of checking the guarantee once a year. The mental and financial costs of postal books are considerable.</p>
<p>2. From the Perspective of Employees</p>
<p>First, in recent years, the world has deteriorated, and people's hearts are not ancient. Employees have embezzled and seized assets from time to time. It is as difficult as climbing to the sky to ask someone to be a guarantor, especially an unlimited liability guarantee, which is even more chilling. If it is not a close relative, who dares to take on the responsibility? Therefore, the first difficult hurdle for anyone entering the banking service is to find a guarantor. Without a suitable guarantor, even if they have outstanding talents, they will have no chance to advance. (Recently, a large bank in Shanghai recruited ten new employees, eight of whom could not proceed with their duties due to lack of suitable guarantors. Also, a commercial bank recruited many trainees, one of whom had excellent grades, but was unable to be hired after submitting a guarantee seven times, eventually committing suicide.) Therefore, there are many idle talents in the society, and the bank has the regret of difficult talents. Talent is the driving force for promoting the cause, and the guarantee is to prevent the driving force from going astray. Therefore, in principle, talent is the main, and the guarantee is the auxiliary. Now, if talent is discarded because the guarantee does not meet the requirements, abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the ends is a waste for society and a loss for the banking industry.</p>
<p>Second, in recent years, cases of employee fraud have emerged one after another, and letters of withdrawal of guarantee are filed every day. Not only are employees in office trembling with fear, causing fluctuations in morale and affecting the efficiency of service, but it is also questionable whether those who have been withdrawn can find another reliable guarantee. If there is no one to continue the guarantee, they can only resign. We speculate that the bank has created rich experience and skilled technology for employees, and the spirit and financial resources it has spent, and the precious time consumed, cannot be overstated. Now, just when they are exploring their talents to serve the bank, they are suddenly ordered to resign due to the guarantor problem. This is a great loss for both the bank and the employee.</p>
<p>Third, the banking industry in our country, in view of the preciousness of outstanding talents, has gradually adopted strict examinations for hiring employees in recent years. The advantage of this system is to eliminate the recommendation of power and the entry of mediocre talents by chance, adhere to the objective vision, and establish the standard of talent. If the selected person is still required to submit a reliable guarantee, so that the poor and helpless person sighs, the choice of talent has been changed from secret to public, and the steps are as difficult as ever. The strategies are different, and the front and back are contradictory.</p>
<p>Fourth, it is found that the general practice of various banks is that senior executives of the head office or managers and deputy managers of the branch office generally do not have guarantors, and these senior executives have more opportunities to embezzle and defraud by virtue of their positions, and the methods are more sensitive, and the amounts are huge. The reports in the newspapers are all verifiable.</p>
<p>3. From the Perspective of Guarantors</p>
<p>First, in recent years, the world has deteriorated, and the extravagant and evil habits have become a trend. According to newspaper reports, there were 38 cases of fraud by bank employees from January 23 to February 24, totaling 1.44 million yuan. Those that were not published in the newspapers may be more than this number. The bank itself is a limited liability organization, while the employee's guarantor must have unlimited liability, which is unreasonable. Therefore, everyone talks about being a guarantor, changes color, and is afraid to try. This is a common phenomenon in society.</p>
<p>Second, according to the survey, some sincere and enthusiastic people guarantee several to dozens of people. No matter how rich their family background is, it is too risky to assume the unlimited liability of more than a dozen people in their positions.</p>
<p>Third, in the past, those who guaranteed others mostly asked for guarantees after their close relatives and friends obtained a job. If they refused, it would be tantamount to cutting off their livelihood. Not only would they feel uneasy, but they would also be spurned. Forced to be a guarantor, they did not originally want to guarantee at the time of underwriting, and after the guarantee, they felt like thorns on their backs, and it was difficult to sleep. If something happened, they would have to be forced to fulfill the guarantee responsibility, which is extremely unreasonable. If the unlimited liability is changed to limited liability, it only reduces the guarantor's responsibility, and does not thoroughly solve the problem of improving the guarantee system.</p>
<p>Fourth, most of the current bank guarantee system has clauses in the insurance policy that state that the right to prior defense is waived. Therefore, in interpretation, its responsibility is no different from that of the principal debtor. Unfortunately, if the insured person commits fraud, the bank can directly seek compensation from the guarantor. The rich are ruined, and it is not enough to continue with fetters. The poor are burdened with debts, and even commit suicide passively. (Last year, a case of a guarantor being implicated in suicide occurred in Xuzhou, see the records in various newspapers.) This kind of tragic fact is harmful to the peace of society. The bank also has no way to thoroughly investigate those with great power and close feelings, and can only suffer losses.</p>
<p>Fifth, there have been cases of guarantors being implicated in the past. Therefore, in recent years, sincere and self-loving people have learned from the past and are unwilling to make guarantees again. On the contrary, those who guarantee others are mostly people with ordinary circumstances. This kind of abnormal fact is contrary to the original intention of the guarantee.</p>
<p>The current guarantee system has more disadvantages than advantages and has no value of existence. This cannot be denied. Although there were also personal guarantors in European and American countries 30 years ago, just like our country's customs, they soon evolved with the evolution of economic institutions, and there is no fact of guaranteeing others. (See Qi's Guarantee) As for advocating gradualism, maintaining the guarantor on one hand and adopting cash guarantee on the other hand seems to be a good method of transition. However, the cumbersome procedures increase the difficulty, and it is neither a fundamental way to improve the guarantee nor is it contrary to today's social trends. In order to relieve the difficulty of employees in finding guarantees and the interests of the guarantee banks, the "Special Cash Guarantee Method" is proposed. I believe that this method is easy to implement, and the above-mentioned difficulties can be eliminated. The collection of funds comes from many sources, and it is easy to gather everyone's strength and gather together. After several years, it is not difficult to raise millions of dollars. According to the provisions of the original plan for type A deposit, it is taken from the United Kingdom. The provisions of the type B deposit are modeled on the United States. (It is heard that the Taiwan Bank's "Personal Guarantee Deposit" is similar in nature.) As for the type C deposit, it is stipulated in accordance with the situation in our country. Moreover, cash guarantees can be expected to gradually reduce due to personal interests and unexpected events, and the provisions on joint and several punishments can be especially effective in mutual supervision.

<h3>Voices Against Water Price Increase</h3>
<p>Tenant Association Declaration - One Special District Federation Expresses</p>
<p>The New Voice Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Waterworks Company has notified users that, starting from February 1st, the water price will be changed from a 25% discount to a 20% discount, effectively raising prices. Users have expressed opposition. The Tenant Association has issued a declaration, stating that it is unbearable. Citizens in various districts are also striving to stop it. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Tenant Declaration The Tenant Association expresses its opposition to the water company's increase in water prices, disregarding the difficult times. It issued a declaration stating: "It is undeniable that the market has been sluggish in recent years, and industry and commerce have declined. All sectors feel that they cannot bear the original donations, taxes, and rents. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Waterworks Company suddenly increased prices at this time. According to its announcement, starting from February 1st, the monthly 25% discount will be changed to a 20% collection. This is shocking. The result of the increased water price will inevitably lead to an increase in rents, causing tenants to suffer even more unbearable hardships. This is unacceptable to tenants. Moreover, tap water is a public utility and should be considered for the majority of users, with low prices as the principle. The company's profits should be secondary. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council Public Waterworks Company has not suffered losses in its business, and now it has suddenly increased prices for unilateral interests, which is confusing and incomprehensible. The Association resolutely opposes this measure by the company, which does not consider the difficult times. In addition to submitting it to party and government agencies for negotiation and prevention, this declaration is made, and we hope that all sectors will advocate unanimously."</p>
<p>Citizens Express Li Biekui, a member of the First Special District Citizens' United Association, and more than 20 district branches, including the 7th, 12th, 16th, 18th, 27th, and 38th, have also sent letters to the association one after another, requesting that they strive to stop the increase in water prices. Not only will it increase the suffering of citizens, but it will also make it more difficult for industry and commerce to recover. After receiving the letter, the City Federation has scheduled a standing committee meeting at 2:00 PM today to discuss negotiation and prevention measures.</p>
<h3>Guohua Bank Offers Educational Fund Deposits</h3>
<p>Guohua Bank's various savings deposits are stable and reliable. Among them, the educational fund deposit is especially accurate in estimating the expenses of various levels of education, including universities, middle schools, and primary schools. It also distinguishes types according to the different financial resources of individuals. Once stored in accordance with the regulations, it can be withdrawn on schedule. The procedures are simple, which is unmatched by other deposits. It is heard that people from all walks of life are flocking to open accounts and deposit, which is quite enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Minsheng Company Maintains Small Shanghai-Chuan (Sichuan) Shipping</h3>
<p>Operated in Three Sections and Transferred Cargo at Qingtan - But Requires an Additional Special Fee of One-Quarter</p>
<p>The Shen Shi News Agency reports that the Minsheng Industrial Company, due to the low water level of the river, is unable to operate on the Shanghai-Chongqing route. Recently, in response to requests from all parties, it decided to transfer transportation in three sections to help alleviate the Shanghai-Chuan transportation. At the same time, there have also been changes in freight rates. The company issued a special notice yesterday, saying, "The river water is dry and shipping is almost cut off. Our company is reluctantly responding to requests from all parties and has agreed to transfer transportation in three sections to help alleviate transportation. ㊀ From Xuan Chang to Miao He, ㊁ From Miao He to Wanxian, ㊂ From Wanxian to Chongqing, is being processed. The Shuntong wheeled ship of the Zhiguang Company suddenly sank in Qingtan, obstructing navigation. For a while, Song Neng was cleared. The port was blocked, and the shipping ships did not dare to pass. They had to negotiate with all parties to temporarily change the location to stop the wheels near Qingtan, and try to transfer the goods on the shore to avoid the dangerous beaches. The original special extra payment of one-quarter of the shipping fee for Shen-Yu, Shen-Wan, and Han-Yu Han-Wan was already far from sufficient. Now it is changed to Qingtan to lift and transport, and a lot of footwork is added. It should have been added with a special payment to subsidize. However, our company has been dealing with freight merchants for many years, and the amount of additional payment has been decided early. It is decided not to change it again, and it would rather bear more losses to show the utmost sincerity in maintaining transportation. If the goods of various freight merchants do not need to be transferred urgently, or are unwilling to bear the special payment, it is hoped that the types of goods will be listed in a separate letter to our Chongqing, Yichang, and Shanghai companies for temporary suspension of the transfer. Wait until the Yichang landing navigation returns to normal before shipping again. If there is no letter to stop the transfer or even if there is a letter to stop the transfer, but the goods have been shipped from Yichang, our company will collect a special payment of one-quarter of the shipping fee for Shen-Yu, Shen-Wan, and Han-Yu Han-Wan when signing the pick-up at Chongqing and Wanxian," and so on.</p>
<h3>Two Women Peddling Counterfeit Coins</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Six Years Each</p>
<p>Yan Zilan, a silk broker from Huzhou, was sipping tea in a small tea house on Dixiwei Road recently when he met a Yangzhou woman, Wang Xu, who was peddling counterfeit French currency from the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The price was quite cheap. For example, 30 yuan in real currency could buy 100 yuan in counterfeit currency. Yan pretended to want to buy 200 yuan in counterfeit five-yuan notes, 100 yuan in counterfeit one-yuan notes, and 100 yuan in counterfeit corner notes.</p>
<p>A Total of 400 Yuan Wang Xu replied that they were all available and agreed to deliver the money near Fengtian Road and Tuopu Road at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. However, the harm of these counterfeit banknotes to society is not small. He secretly reported the situation to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which sent Chinese Detective Jin Yangwu and Detective Dong Qingquan. Yan waited at the agreed location at the appointed time with</p>
<p>Farmers Bank A ten-yuan real banknote covered the top, and the rest were paper banknotes from the Bank of the Republic of China, wrapped in a package that looked like 100 yuan. The two detectives were lying in ambush in other places, watching the movement. After a while, Wang Xu arrived with her fellow villager, Gong Qian. Yan Zilan immediately slipped out the farmers</p>
<p>Legal Tender A bundle was shown to Xu, who said that Gong Qian had to take the money to Chen Shandong at a small inn at No. 8 Xinjiang Road in Zhabei to fetch it. Yan was afraid of being fooled by these people and gave a secret signal to take off the wool hat he was wearing. Detective Jin and Detective Dong rushed forward and arrested the two. In Gong Qian's</p>
<p>Body Found Three counterfeit one-yuan notes from the Central Bank. Two counterfeit ten-yuan notes from the Bank of Communications were found in Wang Xu's bag. They went to No. 8 Xinjiang Road, Zhabei, to arrest Chen Shandong, but he was not found. They took the two to the police station and detained them. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, explained the case. According to Article 196, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law,</p>
<p>Using Counterfeit Coins The crime was prosecuted and a severe punishment was requested. Then, the Fourth Trial Judge and witness Yan Zilan explained the process of cracking the case. The counterfeit banknotes were presented for examination. The two offered evasive confessions. Judge Xiao Xiefen sentenced Gong Qian and Wang Xu to six years each to serve as a warning, and the counterfeit coins were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Fenghua Company Arson Insurance Claim Case The Judge Surveys the Fire Scene</h3>
<p>Although the Window Frames Were Charred, They Were Not Completely Destroyed in the Fire. The Inflammable Materials Were Placed Everywhere, and the Circumstances Were Obvious</p>
<p>At about 2:00 AM on the 21st of this month, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 548 Fuzhou Road, the Fenghua Clothing Company. After a long period of firefighting by the fire brigade, it was extinguished. Later, Lu Gengsheng, the chief of the Chinese detective department of the Lao Zha Police Station, and detectives Ping Xiushan and Zhu Shanghe, learned that the company had fire insurance of 50,000 yuan. This was actually an arson attempt to obtain compensation. Therefore, Wu Ziliang, a shareholder and manager of the company, Wu Songsen, a shareholder, Zhang Kuibo, an accountant,</p>
<p>Implementing Arson Huang Changgen, insurance broker Chen Jianian, etc. were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court. Except for Wu Songsen and Chen Jianian, who were allowed to be released on bail, the rest were remanded. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the criminal court hearing this case, in order to clarify the facts, specifically went to the scene to inspect at 3:00 PM yesterday. At that time, accompanied by the police lawyer Ru Yi, Judge Qian first thoroughly</p>
<p>Conducted an Inspection at the fire site. It was seen that the glass window frames where the goods were placed in the store were charred, but not completely destroyed in the fire. It was obvious that when the fire was set, the gasoline was placed everywhere randomly. Lang then questioned Huang Changgen. According to Huang, the gasoline was stored in a goldfish tank, and four tanks were placed in the rear cargo room downstairs, and two tanks were placed in the rear building upstairs, and reed mats and newspapers were scattered around to ignite them. However, he denied putting gasoline</p>
<p>Placed in other places Judge Qian believed that if the incendiary material was not placed in the front hall of the store, the situation of the window frames being destroyed would not be like this. Therefore, he asked what the situation was, but Huang insisted on his statement. The western fireman of the fire brigade said that the fire engine arrived within two and a half minutes after the fire started and saw that the whole room was full of fireballs. If only gasoline was placed in the back room, the fire would not be so</p>
<p>Fierce Situation. This also proves that there were incendiary materials placed in the front and back houses at that time. After a detailed inspection upstairs and downstairs, Judge Qian ordered the police station to take pictures of the window frames that had not been completely destroyed and submit them to the case for reference, and then returned to the court.</p>
<h3>Xu Xueseng Case Closing Arguments</h3>
<p>Verdict to be Announced at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Lawyer Gu Changyuan defended Zhu Guanghan. Xu Xueseng sued Zhu and Chen Axi for pouring wine and nitric acid to injure his face. The case has been heard repeatedly in the Shanghai District Court. Now Xu Xueseng has submitted a statement to withdraw the private prosecution against Zhu and avoid appearing in court. However, Gao Jinsheng, who poured the wine and nitric acid, was sentenced to four years by the Second Special District Court. Zou Shengzu, the defense lawyer for Gao Jinsheng in the appeal, also entrusted Qiu Changyuan to meet with him when he went to Xizhen on business. Gao Jinsheng, while the Xu-Zhu lawsuit was unresolved, Xu Xueseng found a witness, Fang Aliu, who said that his brother and Gao Jinniu had the same number in the lawsuit. Gu Changyuan, who met with Gao Jinsheng, taught him not to implicate Zhu and others, and also had three letters brought out by Gao, explaining the matter. Therefore, Xu Xueseng sued Gu Changyuan in the Procuratorate of the District Court. At the same time, Fang Aliu went to the Procuratorate to confess that the letters were forged by Xu Xueseng in collusion in an attempt to defraud, and that there was no such thing at all. The prosecutor was furious at Fang Aliu's inconsistency and the mystery of what he was selling in the gourd, so he prosecuted Fang Aliu for perjury and Gu Changyuan for destroying evidence. Yesterday, Judge Lu continued to interrogate him. According to witness Xu Yousan, Fang Aliu and Xu Xueseng had signed a contract when testifying, each holding a copy, with the condition that 10% of the private prosecution proceeds would be paid as a reward. This is what I know. At this point, the prosecutor's opinion was completed, and the judge declared the closing arguments and the verdict will be announced at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Xue Xiangjie Case Automobile Driver Loses Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The Plaintiff's Claim Was Rejected Yesterday</p>

Recently, Wang Yongquan, an automobile driver from Suzhou hired by the Xue family, and his eighteen-year-old son, Genbin, retained a lawyer to request the Civil Court of the First Special Court to confirm Wang Genbin as Xue Xiangjie's illegitimate son. This case has been heard and debated several times in the Special Court.

<h3>Suzhou Road Coffin Case: Police Appeal Rejected</h3>
<p>The defendant remains in custody during the appeal period.</p>
<p>Mao A'gen, a fireman from No. 650, Suzhou Road Fire Brigade in the Xinzha district, Jiang Yuan'tao, a fireman from No. 231, Central District, and Lin Gendi, a female hostess from the roof garden of Sincere Co., were suspected of murdering Cai Ying, a female hostess from the Great World amusement park, at No. 3 Cunfu Lane, Baibao Road, Hongkou, on August 9th of last year. They were further suspected of dismembering her body, placing it in a wooden box, and dumping it on Suzhou Road. Huang Fusen, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou police station, arrested Mao, Jiang, and Lin and sent them to the First Special Court. The police prosecuted them according to Article 271, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code for homicide and Article 247 of the same law for abandoning a corpse. The initial trial ruled that the three defendants, Mao, etc., were innocent due to insufficient evidence. The police, dissatisfied with the judgment, appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court through lawyer Gan Jingxian. The appellees hired lawyer Yan Fangang to defend them in court. The arguments have been concluded. Yesterday afternoon, at half past, Judge Yu Hua, presiding over the trial, along with associate judges Zhou and Nie, ascended the bench to pronounce the verdict. The main text stated, "The appeal is rejected." Lawyer Gan, representing the police, requested that all defendants remain in custody during the appeal period. However, lawyer Fan Gang, representing the appellees, argued that Mao and others had been detained until now for half a year, causing them great suffering, and requested that they be granted bail. Judge Yu instructed that the three defendants be separately detained during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Lu Guanzeng and Wife Disagree, Seeking Return of Stored Jewelry</h3>
<p>Searches conducted at pawnshops and husband's residence. The judge, mindful of their long marriage, earnestly urged reconciliation.</p>
<p>Lu Guanzeng, the grandson of Lu Xiaosong, a late Qing Dynasty狀元 (highest scholar) from Suzhou, is currently thirty-one years old. He resides in his ancestral home at No. 4 Tianguanfang, with a wealthy family. He owns three pawnshops in Shanghai: Yuanli Pawnshop on Wuding Road, and Yuchang Pawnshop on North Chengdu Road, etc. All three pawnshops are managed by Mr. Yu, an over-sixty-year-old from Wuxian. In the spring of the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), Lu Guanzeng, through a matchmaker, married Cheng Shu'yun (currently twenty-nine years old), the daughter of Cheng Huting, a shareholder of Shanghai Fuyuan Money Exchange. They have been married for more than twelve years and have two sons and one daughter, the eldest son being ten years old. Recently, discord arose between the couple. Lu Cheng Shu'yun returned to her mother's home at No. 41 Shengping Street, Fuxu Road, Shanghai, in the first month of the lunar calendar last year and has not returned to her husband's home since. Despite mediation by relatives and friends, it has been ineffective. On November 18th of last year, Lu suddenly filed a petition with the Mediation Court of the Wuxian District Court, requesting Cheng to return home to live with him and to bring back the jewelry she had taken. When the court session opened, Cheng did not appear, resulting in unsuccessful mediation. Unexpectedly, on the 4th of this month, Lu Cheng Shu'yun reported to the Xinzha police, claiming that her dowry and jewelry given to her by Lu Guanzeng, worth a total of 115,260 yuan, were stored at Yuanli Pawnshop under the care of Yu, due to the Qilu War. Now, Yu, at Lu's instruction, refused to hand them over, which clearly constituted intentional embezzlement. She requested investigation according to law. Consequently, the police station requested the First Special Court to issue a search warrant, and searched Yu's residence at No. 889 North Chengdu Road and Lu Guanzeng's residence at No. 7, Lane 102, Tongfu Road, Shanghai, but found nothing. After hearing this, Yu and Lu surrendered themselves to the police station on the 8th of the month. After investigation by Chinese detective Ye Yuyou, Lu and Yu argued that Cheng's jewelry had always been stored at Yuanli Pawnshop. In the first month of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), Cheng came to Shanghai because she needed to attend a wedding banquet and pay New Year's visits. Yu accompanied her to Yuanli Pawnshop to take the jewelry box away, and she never returned. Now, Lu filed a lawsuit with the Wuxian Court requesting cohabitation, and Yu tried to mediate from the middle. Therefore, she filed the complaint to resist. After they were dismissed, the court immediately requested the First Special Court to issue summonses and summoned Lu and Yu to the Second Criminal Court yesterday morning. Lu and Yu complied and arrived with their defense lawyers Wu Linkun, Wang Fuchou, and Jin Henian. Because the police mistakenly identified Lu Guanzeng as Lu Guisheng, the summons was also written as Lu Guisheng. Therefore, lawyer Wu immediately stated that although the defendant's name was wrong, he complied with the summons and appeared in court. Lu Cheng also hired lawyer Ling Qihong to appear in court and filed a civil suit. First, lawyer Jiang Baolian from the police station stated the case, prosecuting according to Article 335 of the Criminal Law for embezzlement, and claiming that the plaintiff had witnesses Wu Shoufeng (female), Chen Huiquan, and Wu Ruisheng appearing in court today to prove that they had seen the jewelry in Yuanli Pawnshop or had personally sold the jewelry to the plaintiff. Judge Zhan Liangce then persuaded the plaintiff Cheng, saying that she and Lu Guanzeng had been married for more than ten years and had children. Since the jewelry belonged to the couple, it was jointly owned property, and they should not be involved in litigation over trivial matters, lest they regret it in the future. Therefore, in his opinion, reconciliation was the best solution. Lawyer Wu Linkun, representing the defendant, stated that the defendant had shown goodwill to the court and expressed great sympathy. He had previously transferred property worth more than 400,000 yuan to her account and handed over all seals to the plaintiff for safekeeping as a condition for reconciliation. However, the plaintiff suddenly regretted the agreement and initiated the current lawsuit. Therefore, he requested the court to instruct the plaintiff to take a step back so that reconciliation would not be impossible. The court then inquired of Yu and Lu whether the plaintiff had deposited jewelry. Both answered that the plaintiff had already taken it away. After further questioning Lu Cheng and the witness Wu Shoufeng, it was past noon. Judge Zhan immediately announced a postponement and instructed both parties to attempt reconciliation outside the court. The plaintiff's attorney requested that the two defendants be released on bail. The court dismissed the request, saying that the defendants had complied with the summons and there was no need for bail.</p>
<h3>Brewery Boiler Explosion Kills Brewer</h3>
<p>Family asks fellow villagers association for help.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Haimen Fellow Villagers Association sent a letter yesterday to the Shanghai Citizens United Association and the Northern Jiangsu Fellow Villagers Association Federation, stating that according to a report from fellow villager Song Hanqing, his son Yuncheng had been working as a brewer at the China Brewery in the city for six years. Unfortunately, at about 1 a.m. on the 15th of this month, while he was working, the brewery boiler, due to years of disrepair, suddenly exploded. Yuncheng, caught off guard, suffered severe injuries to his face and upper body from the blast. His skin was torn and his flesh was exposed, with blood splattering everywhere. The scene was truly horrific. Afterwards, he was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but due to a lack of financial resources to pay for medical expenses, the treatment was delayed, and his injuries worsened. He eventually died on the morning of the 26th because he could not be saved. He left behind a wife, a son, and two daughters, who depended on him for their livelihood. Now that Yuncheng had died tragically, his family's livelihood was bound to be in dire straits, and the brewery had not yet made any indication of compensation. Therefore, they earnestly requested the association to consider their plight, uphold justice, and demand generous compensation from the brewery on their behalf. The association sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the facts. The occurrence of this unfortunate event was indeed due to the brewery's negligence, which led to this tragedy. However, the brewery has turned a blind eye, which is truly unreasonable. Therefore, this letter is sent to urge the association to uphold justice and speak out on behalf of the deceased so that the dead can rest in peace and the living can make a living.</p>

<h3>Employees of Taifeng Company Petition the Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Stopped midway, representatives received.</p>

<h3>National Goods Maintenance Association Asks Government to Assist Taiping Tea Farmers</h3>
<p>The Chinese National Goods Maintenance Association, due to a petition from tea farmers in Taiping County, Anhui Province, requesting submission to the central government for assistance, has specially submitted a request to the National Economic Commission, the International Trade Bureau, and the Tea Industry Control Commission, stating that according to a public letter from the Taiping County Rural Cooperative in southern Anhui, Taiping is a tea-producing area. Over the years, due to rural bankruptcy, economic difficulties, adherence to traditional brewing methods, and a lack of promotion, famous teas have been submerged and unknown. This year, agricultural production has been abundant, and the economy has improved. In addition to the original tea hills, new areas have been extensively developed, and the output is expected to increase. More than 70 rural cooperative organizations have been established, lending approximately 80,000 yuan, which has helped to alleviate rural poverty. Future development is promising. However, due to economic reasons, sales have been hindered, which is regrettable for the development of national and foreign trade. Now, all tea farmers have discussed and decided that, at a time when the national government is striving to promote national goods, they plan to imitate the Qihong and Wulv methods, improve agricultural production, and promote sales. Therefore, they have specially sent Sun Fuxian and Xu Maoqing as representatives to Shanghai to establish a sales office to facilitate progress. The association earnestly requests the commission to report the situation to the National Economic Commission and approve the designation of a bank to establish an office in Taiping County to provide nearby assistance, supervise purchases, and pledge loans against goods, in order to develop the tea industry and facilitate foreign sales.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Posthumously Awards Medal to Fallen Western Constable</h3>
<p>At noon on December 31st of last year, a burglary occurred at No. 378 Beijing Road. At the time, Mr. Slater, a probationary patrolman of the Municipal Council Police Force, was patrolling Beijing Road and Henan Road on a motorcycle with two Chinese constables. Upon hearing the news, they rushed to the scene and found that the iron gate there was closed. They ordered the elevator operator to pull the iron gate open and led Chinese constable No. 3398 and gatekeeper constable No. 1238 into the building to intercept the bandits. Unexpectedly, they encountered the bandits at the staircase, and the two sides exchanged gunfire. Gatekeeper constable No. 2138 and Mr. Slater were shot in vital areas by the bandits one after another. Mr. Slater died on the spot, and the gatekeeper constable also died of his serious injuries (Note: The gatekeeper constable is supervised by the Police Department, but is not an employee of the Municipal Council). Afterwards, the members of the Municipal Council Police Department's Merit and Awards Committee went to the scene to investigate. They all agreed that Mr. Slater's order to the elevator operator to pull open the iron gate and his entry into the building to arrest the bandits showed that he was brave and selfless, and dutiful in his duties, which was deeply commendable. It was recommended that the Chief of Police be requested to submit to the Council a request to posthumously award Mr. Slater a First-Class Police Special Medal. The Municipal Council has approved the posthumous award at the request of the Chief of Police to recognize his merits.</p>
<h3>Wusong Fish Merchants Plead for Flexible Measures at Fish Market</h3>
<p>The Wusong fish market has a history of several decades. The spring and summer are the peak fishing seasons each year. The riverside is lined with sails, and the market is bustling. Fish vendors from all over gather, so shops and peddlers in Songdi are also thriving during the fishing season. The three fishmongers who handle the sales are Cui Sheng, Shen Tai, and Kai Tai. The annual business statistics are about one million yuan. Since the Ministry of Industry established a fish market in Shanghai, it is no longer possible to sell fish independently in Songdi. Therefore, the fishmongers joined the market in accordance with the regulations. The issues of fishing boat berthing and commission extraction have not yet been resolved. As the fishing season is approaching, the fishmongers have stated their difficulties and requested assistance from the Wusong Chamber of Commerce, requesting flexible handling of the fish market to maintain business. It is reported that the fishmongers are requesting the following: ㊀ Requesting fishing boats to berth in Wusong to facilitate unloading and tides; ㊁ Requesting exemption from the four-point commission to reduce the burden of high fish prices and not affect incoming boats. If the market insists on the regulations and cannot be flexible, the fishmongers will have no choice but to declare a shutdown. It is known that the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Zhang Panshi, believes that the existence of the Songdi fish market is of great importance to the market. If the fishmongers shut down, it will affect the business of all stores in the town. Therefore, he is making every effort to find a solution and has written to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward the matter to the fish market for proper resolution.</p>

<h3>Two Boat Collisions</h3>
<p>Two boat collisions occurred yesterday evening in the Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River, causing significant damage. Fortunately, no one was injured. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Two boats collide in Suzhou Creek: Hengfeng Oil Company hired Zhang Ada's gasoline boat No. 72176 to transport twelve large oil baskets and twenty-two small oil baskets from upstream of the Suzhou Creek. When it reached the river surface of Shanxi Road Bridge, a Jiangying small steamer came from Shunda Wharf and made a U-turn there. Due to its abrupt movement, the stern of the steamer collided with the empty wharf boat No. 8856 owned by Yang Bingzhi. The Yang boat was struck, and the left railing struck the gasoline boat, causing the oil boat's cargo to be damaged. Both boats suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Sailboat sunk near Lujiazui: Zhu Xiucheng's sailboat No. 52829 from Chongming was hired by cargo owner Huang Yusheng to transport eighty-four baskets of soybean oil, eighteen packages of brown sugar, four packages of white sugar, seven barrels of soybean oil, two boxes of salted fish, twelve loads of salted meat, fifty pieces of yellow paper, and five packages of flour. Yesterday evening, at low tide, it set sail past the Xinguang Wharf. When it turned sharply towards Lujiazui in Pudong, several coal boats were coming from south to north. The Zhu boat turned sharply to the north. A Muller tugboat towing a cargo ship was coming from the north. The Zhu boat urgently avoided it. The tugboat had safely passed, but the towed cargo ship could not be avoided and crashed into the Zhu boat. The Zhu boat was immediately capsized and the five people on board fell into the water. Fortunately, they were rescued, but the cargo was completely submerged at the bottom of the river, resulting in a huge loss. The overturned boat has been towed to the Pudong beach to prevent it from drifting away. The owners are negotiating with the cargo ship responsible for the accident to claim compensation for the losses.</p>

<h3>Russian Thieves from Tianjin Escorted to Shanghai for the Lafayette Theater Robbery Case</h3>
<p>In April of last year, Russian thieves armed with weapons broke into the Lafayette Theater on Rue Lafayette in the French Concession, threatened the clerks, and robbed them of property.

<h3>Wusong Town Workers Join the Wine and Food Workers' Union</h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that since its establishment, the Shanghai Wine and Food Industry Workers' Union has reached over seven hundred members. Workers from various restaurants in Wusong Town have also joined one after another. Yesterday, the union sent a collector to Wusong to collect membership fees. When the collector went to Shunxing Restaurant on Hongyuan Road to collect fees from worker Huang, the restaurant owner, Gu Yinsheng, unexpectedly clashed with the collector and snatched away the ledger and other items. The matter was reported to the Wusong Town Chamber of Commerce, and Yan Songbin, the person in charge of the chamber, investigated the incident. Since the workers' union is a legitimate labor organization and not an illegal organization, Yan scolded the restaurant owner and returned the ledger to the collector.

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>Greetings. After reading the article on page four of your newspaper dated January 26th regarding the strike by workers at the Datong Lok Cotton Yarn and Cloth Factory yesterday, the content is mostly inaccurate. Our factory has no more than forty or fifty workers in total, and the weaving section has fewer than thirty workers. Recently, due to the fact that weaving workers Zhou Zhongfu and Yang Baoshan did not abide by factory rules, we had no choice but to dismiss them to maintain order throughout the factory. Other than that, no other workers have been dismissed, nor has there been a strike. The suspension of work in the weaving section is a normal practice during the Spring Festival. Also, the wages for yarn and cloth produced by our factory vary depending on the size of the piece and are not uniform. There is absolutely no dispute over new or old weights and measures. The above points do not match what was reported in your newspaper. I am writing this letter specifically to make corrections and request that you verify and publish it to correct the record and avoid misunderstandings. I sincerely hope this will be done. Sincerely, Wu Rongfang, Manager of the Datong Medicine Cotton Yarn and Cloth Factory, January 26th, 26th year [of the Republic - likely 1937]. Greetings. I have just read your newspaper's report on the news of our association's petition to the party and government authorities yesterday, which included mention of organizing a hunger strike and submitting six demands. I was extremely surprised. The current incident is purely because the unified wage rate agreed upon by the Labor-Management Mutual Aid Conference jointly formed by our association and the trade association has not been implemented. Although our association's negotiations have been ineffective, all the workers have reluctantly stopped work and jointly requested assistance from the party and government. There are no other demands or any organization. Your newspaper's report is likely based on inaccurate rumors. I have prepared this letter to inform you and request that you correct it to avoid misrepresentation. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Shanghai Dental Bone Device Industry Workers' Union, January 16th, 26th year [of the Republic - likely 1937].</p>

<h3>Speaking of the Contributions of the Family and First-Class National Products</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>If you were to ask any family or any housewife for their opinion on national products, they would invariably say that they purchase high-quality national products and hope that national product factories will make improving the manufacture of national products their top priority. In other words, everyone wants to obtain first-class national products for their use. This is a sentiment shared by all. However, to obtain first-class national products, half of the responsibility lies in the promotion and encouragement of users, and the other half lies in the honesty and courage of manufacturers. The first responsibility of promotion and encouragement lies in having confidence, firmly believing that unless national products are used, it will be insufficient to save the country and it will be impossible to resolve the economic crisis. The second lies in being able to forgive. One must understand that while the quality of national products may not be as good as that of foreign goods, and the price of national products may be higher than that of foreign goods, as Chinese people, we must use Chinese goods. It is not difficult to wait for a time when the quality is good and the price is low. The third lies in having the ability to distinguish between what is a national product and what is not. What are the advantages of national products? What are the areas that are acceptable and should be improved? These are all the responsibilities of our users. For factories, with an honest attitude and the determination to improve, the name of first-class national products can be rightfully received. When running a factory, one should know that there are three major points: ① In purchasing high-quality machinery. If a worker wants to do a good job, he must first sharpen his tools. With high-quality machinery, one can then manufacture high-quality products. Those who are constantly stuck in manual manufacturing and are only capable of producing crude and substandard goods will definitely not survive in the era of industrial competition. ② In seeking out technical talent. In the future, if national products are to compete with foreign goods, there is no other way to win except through technology. Poor technology will inevitably be eliminated. Do not let the specialized talents who are cultivated domestically and abroad each year have no place to use their skills, nor let them change to political careers or end their lives as teachers. Recently, Wu Dingchang, the Minister of Industry, established the National Products Joint Operating Company and allocated 30% of the surplus to national loan manufacturing improvement costs and 10% to national product talent training costs. His emphasis on talent training and technological improvement is insightful and admired by all. ③ In reducing costs. The competition between national and non-national products lies not only in improving manufacturing but also in reducing costs. What kind of consumption can be saved, what kind of waste can be used, how to improve work efficiency, and how to reduce labor costs? These are all important issues in trial cost accounting that cannot be ignored in peacetime. Furthermore, for those who want to achieve first-class national products, they must know. Ms. Xu Quhuang submitted seven fundamental measures for national products, paying special attention to the cultivation of specialized talents and praising her insightful views. For national product merchants, they should always seek convenience for household users to purchase goods, such as setting up national product advisory departments in various stores, setting up national product sample display locations in various schools, national product companies running competitive purchase incentive certificates, and setting up branch companies everywhere. These are all connections that should exist between first-class national product factories and households schools. Based on the results of family visits, I have these trivial suggestions, hoping that the leaders of all first-class factories in the twenty-sixth year [of the Republic - likely 1937] will take our expectations to heart, take them as an urgent task, and work together to comfort the sincere wishes of national product enthusiasts, both men and women. I cannot help but wait and see.</p>
<h3>New Plans that the National Products Industry Should Have</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>A new year is quickly passing by one month, and our national products are continuing to work hard in a very difficult struggle. "The plan for the year lies in the spring," this is what the ancients have clearly told us. The progress of a career is necessary to predetermine a new plan at the beginning of the year, and then constantly complete, implement, and realize it.</p>
<p>Therefore, at this time, I deeply feel that our entire national products industry should have a rigorous and practical new plan as soon as possible, look around at the current situation, and determine the central work for the development of national products in the future. This is a very urgent task. Here, I specially put forward three points, dare to contribute to all those engaged in the national products business:</p>
<p>First, it is to expand production and appropriately increase prices. Since the good harvest in various places last year, and the rural economy is more affluent, the national demand for national products from the national public is increasing day by day, but domestic production has a trend of being unable to meet the demand. In addition, recently, the prices of various industrial raw materials have been soaring, and the prices of goods are all increasing. This is actually a phenomenon that the national products industry is gradually entering a better state. Therefore, from this year onwards, how our national product manufacturers should expand production to broaden sales channels, and appropriately increase the price of goods to maintain costs, this all requires efforts to implement, and to achieve this by strengthening the connection between the same industry.</p>
<p>Second, it is to manufacture new substitutes for foreign goods. In recent years, the amount of import surpluses has gradually decreased, but imports of foreign goods are still very alarming, especially general luxury goods, which have actually increased in the import last year. The reason for this is that one party is due to the fact that the national worship of foreign goods in the minds of a few people has not been eradicated, and the other party is because there are many foreign goods that do not have national product substitutes. Therefore, from this year onwards, our national products industry should pay attention to widely manufacturing new substitutes for foreign loans, conduct detailed research, and actively imitate. This is also a very important task.</p>
<p>Third, it is to continue to work hard to open up overseas markets, and the active progress of the National Products Joint Operating Company. These two points are both the established policies of our national products industry last year, and should be further worked hard and completed from this year onwards, because these are two basic paths for the development of national products. It is also the only prerequisite for laying the foundation for national economic construction!</p>

<h3>National Products in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Ji Yuanzhi</p>
<p>The word "Beiping" in the minds of Chinese people all know that it is the "front line of national defense," but do not know that it is a "location where private goods are accumulated?" Indeed: Miyun County in the northwest of Beiping, Tong County in the east, and Fengtai Town in the due west are all under special circumstances; and there are many Japanese troops stationed in these three places. The Jicha Committee led by Chairman Song Zheyuan is also located here, so Beiping is the "front line of national defense," but you must know that it is also a heroic city resisting great threats!</p>
<p>Even so; after all, its surrounding situation is special, and the loss of political power of the Beining Railway gives private goods great convenience, and this ancient Beiping is also filled with private goods because of this, and today it has been reduced to a state where there is no place where there are no private goods, and nothing is not a private good.</p>
<p>We often go to the market to wander around and browse, carefully observe for a week, and what is printed in our minds is nothing but private goods and inferior goods. If you want to buy some national products, if you don't put in great care and patience, it is absolutely impossible to get them. The author once bought Wudi brand toothpaste in the market, and it took more than ten stores to buy it, and the seller only had one. Other brands (national products) are available in every store, and there are many, which can be seen from this.</p>
<p>The situation of national products and foreign goods (mostly private goods) in Beiping is as described above: Let's talk about the national product companies and their sales methods in Beiping. We feel that there is a lack of them. Now there are only the National Products Sales Office, Zhongyuan Company (not purely selling national products), and one or two other stores, but only three or four stores cannot supply the entire city, not to mention that the Sales Office and Zhongyuan Company are both located on Wangfujing Street, and the scope of sales is only convenient for the corner of the east city, and the other three corners are not easy to buy. The sales methods of national products in Beiping are also not comparable to those of foreign goods; either the interest rate is small, or they are not effective, and they will not take advantage of opportunities. This can often be heard in the mouths of merchants in this city. National product factories across the country should pay special attention to this point.</p>
<p>Finally, we talk about the sales volume of national products in Beiping; according to what I think, it will definitely not be lower than any other place, because there are many students in Beiping, they are greatly stimulated, and they also love national products very much, so the author wrote out the situation of national loans in Beiping for reference by national loan factories across the country, and should pay attention to the development of national products in Beiping again and again, and set up more distribution points within the possible scope, and improve sales methods, so as to avoid the feeling of Beiping compatriots that national products cannot be purchased anywhere, and sigh at foreign countries.</p>

<h3>A Brief Discussion on Promotion (1)</h3>
<p>— Ding Kai</p>
<p>To the Authorities of National Product Factories</p>
<p>Introduction: It is not easy to establish a factory, and it is even more difficult to make the factory's business stable. It is not easy to manufacture an item, and it is even more difficult to make the item's sales stable. The creation of these two environments must have the use of appropriate funds, and the distribution of appropriate talents and appropriate management. But there is also a biggest core, which is the design and implementation of the "promotion" aspect.</p>
<p>Here we will not talk about any theories in vain, we should discuss the facts, and describe the various aspects of the promotion problem in sections, and we also intend to study the various promotion policies of the national product factories as far as our limited knowledge allows. (For example, the promotion of electrical appliances, the promotion of enamel, the author is ignorant and has limited knowledge, but is driven by enthusiasm for national products, and hopes that advanced and virtuous people can discuss and correct them, and it is not only the national products that are lucky.</p>
<p>(1) The Victory of Promotion is Based on Psychological Analysis</p>
<p>The people who are active in various institutions of society, no matter which one, can be said to be a salesman, either promoting a commodity, or promoting a service; not promoting a service, but promoting an ideology; they rely on flexible wrists, use lotus-like wonderful tongues, and strive to make the acceptance of the relative person the goal, in order to complete the success of the mission.</p>
<p>The acceptance of the relative person is the only object that the promoter should recognize, whether it is "through its merchants," "large and small wholesalers," "door-to-door merchants," or forced to sell directly to consumers, they must have individual psychological coping, or individual adaptation to environmental coping. Promotion is a difficult term, and we must thoroughly understand the meaning of its wiping, and briefly analyze the conditions it should have:</p>
<p>(A) The aspects of promotion:</p>
<p>① Kind and friendly appearance and demeanor</p>
<p>② Strong and lively physique</p>
<p>③ Necessary conditions for language thought and basic knowledge</p>
<p>④ Recognition of the mission it bears</p>
<p>⑤ Recognition of necessary principle studies</p>
<p>(B) The aspects of sales:</p>
<p>① The refinement and beauty of the goods</p>
<p>② Research on the psychology of consumers</p>
<p>③ Taking into account the interests of intermediate merchants (including sales channels)</p>
<p>④ Research on general customs and human feelings</p>
<h3>The Development of Visitation Work</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xu Songzi</p>
<p>Family visitation work, appearing in the national goods movement with a brand new progressive stance, has so far had a working history of four months. Just as this short first phase of work comes to an end, it happens to coincide with the arrival of the "end of the year."</p>
<p>The year 1936 has finally passed, and the new year of 1937 is coming with infinite hope. As practical workers in the national goods movement, how should we remember the lesson of "learning from the past to guide the future," grasp past experience, and work hard in a timely manner to carry out the work we are responsible for?</p>
<p>Where are the gains from past work? Try to review the first phase of work. Excluding the time spent "visiting factories," and based solely on the statistics of 81 actual working days already published by our association—the Shanghai National Goods Movement United Association—the visited areas are mainly concentrated in the southwestern part of the first and second special districts, which are upper and middle class residential areas, totaling 31 routes. The total number of upper and middle class families visited is 3,195. If we calculate an average of five people per household, the number of people who have received a deep impression of national goods promotion should reach 15,975.</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on the statistics of the opinions of the above-mentioned 3,000-plus housewives on national goods, those who believe that national goods have become increasingly advanced and can replace foreign goods account for slightly more than 40%, those who believe that they can still be used account for 30%, and those who believe that they are not suitable or are skeptical account for slightly less than 30%. We can firmly assert that, due to the gradual improvement of national goods and the efforts of the Chinese people to protect national products, those who are determined to use national goods account for more than 70%. Even for the remaining 30% or less, after we show them samples from various factories and earnestly persuade them, most of them express their trust and are even willing to join in using national goods.</p>
<p>Of course, Shanghai is large and populous, and these tens of thousands of people are only a small part. However, in terms of consumption power, because most of them belong to the upper and middle classes, they account for the largest number, without a doubt. Just imagine that these tens of thousands of people who possess a large amount of consumption power can reject foreign goods and use national products in the future, then the power to recover losses and stop import surpluses will be amazing!</p>
<p>Therefore, although the visitation work has only been carried out for a short period of time, its great significance in the national goods movement has been recognized by the national goods industry and has received the support of the general public, which is not accidental.</p>
<p>Now, the second phase of work has begun with the change of the year. How should we proceed to continue to carry out the important task we are responsible for?</p>
<p>㊀ Visiting Lower and Middle Class Areas As Mr. Huang Renzhi pointed out, "The upper and middle classes are indeed the most capable consumers, but the lower and middle classes account for the majority of the population and cannot be ignored." Since visitation work has been included in the outline of this year's work of our association, in the future, in addition to continuing to revisit upper and middle class areas, we should strive to arouse the patriotic enthusiasm of the lower and middle classes, so that the determination to use national goods can become a fortress. Only the power of the whole people can lay a deep and solid foundation for the national goods movement.</p>
<p>㊁ Going Deep into Schools and Social Organizations In addition to family visits, visits to girls' schools and various social organizations in Shanghai are also necessary. Because they not only have a large number of people, but are also in an era of seeking knowledge or service. With their wisdom and ability, they have the power to shake society. We should implement this work immediately.</p>
<p>㊂ Responding to the "Civil Servants' National Goods Year" Movement The national goods industry has proposed this year as the "Civil Servants' National Goods Year." This meaning and painstaking effort are worthy of praise. I believe that this movement should also be responded to in visitation work. That is to say, when we visit the families of civil servants, we should especially sincerely state our hopes and listen to their opinions. In that case, the "Civil Servants' National Goods Year" can exert its great significance and shine brightly in national self-awareness and the national goods movement!</p>

<h3>Touchstone</h3>
<p>— (Jiao Shijie)</p>
<p>Using a magnet, the genuine or fake subsidiary coins can be immediately distinguished, which is called the touchstone of subsidiary coins.</p>
<p>School examinations are the touchstone for students to urge diligence.</p>
<p>The economic depression of society is the touchstone for true talents and practical knowledge versus mediocre and unlearned people.</p>
<p>Love built on money, where money is sufficient, love is strong, and where money is lacking, love is weak, is the touchstone of love.</p>
<p>The strength and timidity of national character are the touchstone of national strength and weakness.</p>
<p>The more serious the national crisis, the more obvious the goodness, evil, loyalty, and treachery of people's hearts become. Whether there is a conscience or not can be judged immediately, which is the touchstone of personality.</p>
<h3>A Study on the Great Master of Classical Learning, Zhang Taiyan</h3>
<p>— Yang Renchu</p>
<p>The three great masters of classical learning in the late Qing Dynasty were: Yu Quyuan of Deqing, Sun Zhongrong of Ruian, and Mr. Zhang of Yuhang, who was also one of them. Masters Yu and Sun have long since passed away, and unfortunately, this only surviving star in the field of classical learning also passed away last year. Mr. Zhang studied under Master Yu in his youth, and was extremely cautious in his study of elementary learning. In his middle age, he had in-depth research in Buddhism. His tireless, head-down study of ancient books, and his spirit of textual research, identifying forgeries, and exegesis, are all admirable. Mr. Liang Qichao once praised him, saying: "In this period of transformation and decline of Qing learning, there is one person who can greatly expand his army for the orthodox school, and that is Zhang Taiyan of Yuhang... The chapters on writing and phonology in his works, such as "Wen Shi" and "Guo Gu Lun Heng," contain many essences that the elders of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods did not invent. He applied the research methods of the orthodox school, expanded its content, and extended its new path, which is a great success for Mr. Zhang." But not only that, Mr. Zhang also issued political opinions and participated in actual activities in addition to his study of metallurgy, which is indeed full of the atmosphere of the Zhe Dong school of history.</p>
<p>The reason why Mr. Zhang took the name "Taiyan" is actually because it contains a deep meaning: Mr. Zhang devoted himself to classical learning, and the people he admired throughout his life, in addition to Master Yu Quyuan, were also Mr. Huang Taichong of Yuyao in the late Ming Dynasty, who used the system of Lianluo to synthesize the various schools, and Gu Yanwu, the great master of enlightenment of classical learning. Therefore, Mr. Zhang took "Tai" from Huang Taichong and "Yan" from Gu Yanwu, combined and connected them, and used "Taiyan" as his courtesy name.</p>
<h3>Stories about Maps</h3>
<p>— Xian Weisheng</p>
<p>As people of the present age, everyone should be familiar with the geography of their own country, from a small township, county, or province, to the entire country, continent, and world. Especially when a war breaks out in the country, "geography" is really important. Therefore, in schools now, the subject of geography is also included in the main subjects. This is not the subject of this article, so I will not mention it for the time being. The following three stories are all true, and reading them, you can know the importance of geography to "those who govern the country"!</p>
<p>㊀ When Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Nation, was studying in Hong Kong in his youth, he not only studied geography hard in class, but also covered the top of his mosquito net with a large map, so that he could lie down and watch it in his spare time before getting up in the morning and before falling asleep at night. He could really see everything at a glance. At that time, none of his classmates did not laugh at him, but he was actually very meaningful!</p>
<p>㊁ During the intense European War, there was a German staff officer named A Tai Mu. Because he wanted to enable soldiers to see the map in the dark wilderness, he spent a lot of thought and invented a "night map" printed with phosphorus (the method is the same as a night light), which was issued to the soldiers to carry and see. It could be seen clearly at a glance on the battlefield where you couldn't see your fingers, without having to shine a light, which was really ingenious!</p>
<p>㊂ There was also one more thing. Also during the European War, an American doctor named Ma Lige invented a kind of bread for battlefield use. Each bread was printed with a map, so that a group of soldiers could care about which place was important and which place was not important while eating. And it was very convenient to carry, which was indeed a good method!</p>
<h3>Winter</h3>
<p>— Cao Yixuan</p>
<p>Three Physiological Changes</p>
<p>First, why is there more urination? When our body is cold, the blood vessels in the skin will contract. When the blood vessels contract, more blood in the skin will flow back to the internal organs. At this time, the blood almost flows to the Malpighian corpuscle in the kidney, which becomes urine, so the amount of urine increases. On the one hand, because the climate is cold, sweating is also greatly reduced, and its water is also drawn back from the blood vessels to the kidneys and becomes urine. But how much urine is there? Ordinary men have one liter to one and a half liters a day, and in severe cold, the amount of urine will double. Second, why are hands and feet cold? When hands and feet are cold, the blood vessels of the whole body will contract, and the circulation of blood will not be smooth. At this time, there will be more blood in the brain. Generally, when the brain is anemic, you will sleep. So when the limbs are cold in winter, the brain will not be anemic, and you will not sleep. For example, if you eat a full meal or warm up your hands and feet, the blood will gather in the visceral skin, the brain will become anemic, and you will fall asleep. Third, why do blood vessels contract? In winter, the temperature is low, and heat is taken away from the body surface. However, if the body cannot maintain a certain body temperature, and the body cannot release an infinite amount of heat, then the inside of the body contracts the blood vessels of the skin in order to store blood. Since the blood vessels of the skin are contracted, the circulation of warm blood is reduced, and the skin surface is stimulated by the cold temperature, so the body naturally feels cold.</p>
<p>Advantages and Disadvantages of Heating Appliances</p>
<p>There is an old saying that "a cold head and warm feet" indicates that a person is healthy. However, for people who are thin, old, and cold-blooded women, it is the opposite. It is these people who have cold extremities in winter, making it inconvenient to work during the day and unable to sleep at night. Most of them are people above the middle class. In winter, they use hot water tanks, stoves, and other auxiliary temperatures. There are distinctions between using electric coal, charcoal, firewood, etc. Although hot water tanks are the safest, they are very expensive. Inferior electric stoves are very dangerous. If burning coal, firewood, etc., can indeed provide heat, but on the one hand, carbonic acid gas is released, and it often makes the air dry, which is very harmful to hygiene and often causes tracheobronchitis and throat diseases. Moreover, staying in a heated room all day and suddenly running outdoors, it is easy to catch a cold and cough due to the drastic changes in indoor and outdoor temperatures. Therefore, in a heated room, you should wear less clothing, and always wear a mask when going out, so that you can harmonize the drastic changes in indoor and outdoor temperatures.</p>
<p>Passive Heating Method</p>
<p>When we arrive in cold weather and want to maintain our body temperature, it is most appropriate to use passive heating methods, that is, to use "exercise" and "friction" to help body temperature. Practicing exercises every day, or running for ten minutes, can also make the blood circulate often, or rubbing the skin with a dry cloth can also increase the skin's resistance and not be afraid of the cold. In recent years, countries have been advocating "sunbathing," paying attention to exposing more sunlight outdoors, or building glass rooms for heating. However, the sunlight received in glass rooms, the ultraviolet rays in the sunlight that are beneficial to the body, are reduced in effectiveness when they pass through the glass.</p>
<h3>Newly Invented Powdered Meals</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>People often predict that a type of medicine tablet-like meal will be popular in the future. Now this type of meal has at least appeared slightly. In the office of a company in London, there are three small bottles on display, each containing two ounces of powdered meal. One bottle is equivalent to one pound of roast beef slices, one bottle is equivalent to 40 heads of lettuce, and one bottle is equivalent to 40 heads of spinach. There are also dried strawberries, which weigh almost nothing. Just put them in water and they will restore their original weight, taste, and substance. There are also small black raisins, which have been dried for nearly two years. When put in the mouth, they are soft, tender, and full of deliciousness. According to scientists: "These powdered meals retain their important nutrients. There are many uses. One is to add water to become a slurry, which can be sandwiched between bread and biscuits to eat." According to Mr. Adams, the president of Tai Xitela Xing Co., Ltd.: "This method was invented by Captain Lai Wande. He saw that many items were damaged by warm air on the ship, and felt very sorry. When he was thinking about how to solve the problem of lead skin being damaged by moisture, he thought that most goods contain a lot of useless warm air, and thought that if this warm air could be completely dissipated, it could reduce freight a lot. Later, he saw mummies on display in the British Museum, and thought that the human body of flesh and blood can be preserved for thousands of years without being damaged, so why can't other things be preserved in the same way? We can store the fodder of cattle and sheep, why can't we store beef and mutton like the fodder that cattle and sheep eat? Later, he came up with a method of grinding meals into powder. One layer is convenient to carry and easy to digest. The second layer is to make fruits and vegetables into powder, so that you can taste them at any time of the year. There is also a layer that almost every industry suffers from the accumulation of moisture. After the problem of dissipating moisture is solved, industries such as hats, fur goods, golf balls, tobacco, and rayon will lose a large sum of money every year. Powdered meals are still experimental products, and it is expected that they will be welcomed by people in the future.</p>
<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>Mutton Soup</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>A red paper poster is pasted on the door of the restaurant again—“Braised mutton is on the market, new delicious lamb is added”. People in the city are born with good fortune. Someone has already prepared what to eat in what season in advance, and notified you. In fact, in Shanghai, I have never eaten flavorful mutton at all. A "white cut" in the mutton porridge shop, dipped in sweet sauce, can't taste the flavor of mutton. Braised, the braising method like stir-fried fish fillets will never be rotten. If it is not rotten, then it tastes like chewing wax, so what is the famous "hot pot mutton"? The taste is also mediocre.</p>
<p>Gentlemen in the city eat things just to get by. The restaurant is afraid that the diners will dislike the smell of mutton, so they boil it again and again, and the original flavor is completely gone. It's like eating mutton dregs. What is the taste? Therefore, I think of the "mutton soup" in my hometown again. Although I haven't tasted it for eight or nine years, the aftertaste is still so delicious.</p>
<p>After the Double Ninth Festival, the weather in the countryside is getting colder day by day, especially at night. In mid-September, you have to wear a cotton vest. At this time, someone in the town will open a mutton shop to sell mutton soup. I remember that the person who slaughtered sheep in our town was called "Sou Wu Long." The person was so dirty, but his braising mutton skills were unique, and old diners praised him. On the day he slaughtered sheep, he recruited diners early in the morning: "Hey, come eat mutton soup tonight, I guarantee it will be so fresh that your eyebrows will fall off haha hehe...". At that time, I was young, so I was not considered a customer. When I went back at the age of seventeen, I also became a guest of honor.</p>
<p>Three old-fashioned tables and a dozen long benches are set up in a dilapidated wall gate. After the night school in Dongyuan ends, diners come in droves. Among them, there are naturally gamblers and smokers. A stingy person shouts for a bowl of clear mutton soup, but there are a few smooth bones at the bottom of the bowl, some garlic leaves floating on the soup, sprinkled with pepper powder, and sung into the stomach, it also warms the body. Ordinary people shout for soup, and then shout for "a hoof and a crutch". The so-called "hoof" and "crutch" are the leg bones and knee bones of the sheep, with some meat on them to gnaw. It is not suitable for old people without teeth. More generous people will jointly make a pot of braised meat, three guests braising for six hundred, or four guests braising for one thousand. Use rock sugar to braise, so the meat is rotten and the taste is thick. Everyone's mouths are shiny with oil. If you have a good appetite and a lot of money, you can call for a pot in a row.</p>
<p>If you eat braised mutton, mutton soup is complimentary. Mutton soup is the original juice of raw sheep in the pot. After the sheep is cooked, salt and ginger are added to the soup. This may be considered smelly and dirty by people in the city, but the true taste of sheep is all in the soup. It's cold, I really want to taste the mutton soup from my hometown.</p>
<h3>The Swapped Phoenixes</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 10 (Su Pa Sends Endearing Strange Texts in Error, Yellow Flowers Face Withered Autumn Letters Add Sorrow)</p>
<p>Guoqi was shifting his gaze from her face to her feet, deliberately avoiding her gaze. He himself was inexplicably confused, unsure if it was intentional avoidance or unintentional. In just a fleeting moment, they passed each other by. By the time Guoqi came to his senses, Menglan had already walked far away. This opportunity to speak had been lost, and he couldn't open his mouth again for a second meeting. One instance followed another, continuing according to the previous pattern. He still eagerly awaited her from afar every day, but when they actually met, it was at most an exchange of glances before they parted ways. More than a month passed, and it was now late autumn. One day, it was drizzling. Menglan held a small umbrella, and the northwest wind blew through the rain, causing her clothes and hair to flutter. She clutched her satchel tightly, feeling a chill and discomfort. She stepped on the stone slabs, feeling unsteady. She rested the small umbrella on her shoulder, deeply furrowing her brows and looking down at the ground in front of her. Later, when she arrived at the place where she met Guoqi, he was indeed there. However, he also had a sorrowful look on his face and deeply furrowed brows. He wore a raincoat, with his hands tucked into the pockets, and walked slowly with hunched shoulders. Although they met, it was still an exchange of glances. However, when he looked at her, he didn't have the joyful and affectionate expression that he usually had in his eyes. Instead, it was as if he was hiding some sadness in his heart. As he walked closer, he nodded slightly, as if telling her that he was not feeling well. When Menglan saw his expression, she knew that he must have been stimulated, but she didn't know why. She couldn't help but pay closer attention to him. However, Guoqi was always like that. As long as someone looked at him, he would lower his head. Moreover, as a girl, she could never be the first to speak and ask him what was wrong. So she just paused for a moment and let him pass. After returning home, Menglan thought that Guoqi was truly a rare, mature young man. Although there were some overly emotional words in his writing, he was always very serious every time they met. If he were like ordinary people, after knowing each other for a while, he would have started talking. So, why was he so sad today, which she could tell as soon as they met? But he was a person with a special nature and never spoke. Seeing him in such a melancholic state today, although it might not be for her sake, it didn't diminish her own worry. Perhaps it wasn't entirely unrelated? (128)</p>
<p>Personal Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Past Events Unrelated to "Diplomatic Secrets" (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenxiang</p>
<p>After the May 5th Incident, Zhang Naiyan, the president of Central University, invited Xu Shumo to give a lecture. A year later, when Mr. Xu was the special commissioner of Jiangsu Province, Mr. Zhang again invited Mr. Xu to the Qing Gymnasium of Central University to participate in the weekly memorial service for Premier Sun, where he gave a speech on "China's Legal Rights." When introducing Mr. Xu to the students, President Zhang said: "Mr. Xu is one of the top diplomats in China." Later, after Mr. Zhang left Central University, he briefly entered the diplomatic field and had direct contact with Mr. Xu. But at that time, Zhang Naiyan himself could never have imagined that he would enter the diplomatic field, and Xu Mo even less imagined that Zhang Naiyan would leave the diplomatic field like a swallow, coming and going so quickly!</p>
<p>Second, let's talk about Zhang Naiyan! Mr. Zhang studied chemistry abroad, so he later invented the "Indanthrene" color, and he himself liked to wear a long gown of Indanthrene, or over his robe. He was always very amiable to people. At the same time, he also liked to study history and literature. Therefore, he also had several works such as "History of the World War" and "History of Rome." However, he lacked "alertness" in his character, because he simply didn't like any tricks or changes. He was even less patient with many formalities. Of all the conditions that were considered necessary in the diplomatic field, except for a good appearance and fluent speech, he was unwilling to learn those etiquettes. Therefore, he often had some impolite moments abroad. Perhaps his environment was too good. In general, people from extremely affluent environments often have exquisite and unique places in their learning, but in worldly affairs, that is, in dealing with and handling human affairs, they inevitably leave some handles and give people something to talk about. Zhang Naiyan had many careless and unobservant moments in Belgium, and various rumors arose outside. It is said that once he wanted to attend a grand banquet hosted by the Belgian Prime Minister, but he carelessly went to another Prime Minister's place. This Prime Minister was originally the Prime Minister of an insurance company, a foreign businessman who rarely had the opportunity to meet an international guest. Seeing that Mr. Zhang was so sincere in his hospitality, and the dinner was also a lavish feast, he happily drank a lot of champagne. It was not until he returned home full that he realized he had made a mistake. He had not deliberately missed the Belgian Prime Minister's grand banquet, but had accidentally gone to the wrong place. But there was no way to apologize the next day.</p>
<p>The diplomatic community often uses Mr. Zhang's departure from Belgium as a topic of conversation. It doesn't seem that Mr. Zhang has too many handles. In fact, in the past ten years, there are many things that are inconvenient to talk about and cannot be said about the dynamics within the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Talking about other people's handles will involve offending other people, so they knowingly pretend to be ignorant and don't talk about them. Only when talking about Mr. Zhang's affairs do people think that they are unrelated to "diplomatic secrets," and they often add embellishments, making it sound wonderful, as if only Zhang Naiyan is like this. In fact, there are quite a few cases where it is "impossible to wash it clean even by jumping into the Yellow River," and Mr. Zhang has a hard time defending himself!</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Unusually Cheap Mutton</h3>
<p>— Yun Hai</p>
<p>While the prices of various commodities are constantly rising, a shocking piece of news suddenly appeared: the price of mutton in Peiping is falling day by day. One yuan in legal tender can buy more than six catties, which is almost half the price compared to previous years." This can't be considered anything other than a "world wonder," a freak phenomenon among freak phenomena.</p>
<p>However, some people may think that this is a normal state. Because the abnormality of an abnormality is not the normality of the time when it was not abnormal? If we really think that way, it would be extremely foolish. The fact is definitely not like this. Everything has cause and effect. If we look at the effect and forget to pursue the cause of the effect, then we will only be deceived by the surface of the matter. So, what is the reason for the unusually cheap mutton? The evening newspaper on the 20th had this piece of news: ——</p>
<p>"The various places in Sui East are close to the interior, so the development is earlier than other Mongolian banners. However, most Mongolians still live by nomadic means, and their food and clothing needs all depend on livestock. Therefore, the wealth of a family is always judged by the number of livestock. Since the bandits and puppets committed crimes in Sui last winter, engaging in rape, plunder, and robbery without any discipline, Sui East and Sui North were hit hard, and nine out of ten Mongolian people fled to avoid disaster. All livestock (of which sheep account for the largest majority) are difficult to graze due to the cold weather and withered grass, and it is even impossible to carry feed. Therefore, they had no choice but to take advantage of the convenience of railway transportation to transport them out one after another, and sell them along the way, with Peiping being the largest outlet......"</p>
<p>After reading this piece of news, you will probably understand, and the dream of joy and happiness can be shattered without being attacked. The ending of that news is two very painful sentences: "The Mongolians sacrificed painfully, and all cried out in misery." I believe that after hearing these two sentences, if you are a Chinese person made of flesh and blood, you probably can't be indifferent.</p>
<p>As for those people who are happy to eat dirt-cheap mutton, I wonder if they have ever thought about why this mutton is so cheap, and in what kind of terrible situation the owner of this mutton is living now?</p>
<h3>Alleyway Song</h3>
<p>— Hun</p>
<p>To call it an alleyway is no exaggeration. I myself have spent a few years in slums, but I never dreamed that in the so-called "Shanghai of Ten Miles of Foreign Settlements," there would still exist such dilapidated, filthy, pigsty-like alleyways. As for the reason for their existence, perhaps it is the same as those shantytowns that were once slated for demolition? But their fate will probably meet the same judgment.</p>
<p>To be more precise, it's not even an alley, just a few broken houses surrounded by bamboo fences on a piece of wasteland. Some of the houses are about to collapse, so one or two wooden stakes are used to prop up the leaning walls. On days of strong wind and heavy rain, they might suddenly collapse and crush several lives.</p>
<p>Outside the bamboo fence is an even larger open space, filled with garbage heaps, dog excrement, and all sorts of unsightly things. Groups of children are still there dreaming of finding gold in the sand. Those children are naturally the little masters of the alleyway. Sometimes, street performers who change tricks also choose a corner to shelter from the wind, beating their gongs to attract passersby to gather around and watch one or two inferior tricks.</p>
<p>I had to pass by there every day. At first, I felt quite indignant. We are all human beings, why is there such a big difference in where we live? And the people who live there are the most capable of creating wealth. If they were eliminated, all the big entrepreneurs could only stare blankly at their factories and large capital. This indignation is naturally the thought of a bookworm whose brain has been ruined by reading. Afterwards, it was forgotten: because outside of books, there are so many unfair things that will leave you dumbfounded.</p>
<p>However, an old man with white hair living in that alleyway has remained etched in my mind like iron. Every night, as soon as I heard his singing of "The First Month is the New Spring," every part of my body felt as if it were being pierced by sharp needles. Perhaps it had even deeply pierced my heart. I almost wanted to plug my ears, even if it meant becoming deaf for life.</p>
<p>The old man was supported by a young girl, whom he said was his granddaughter. The girl had a round face and a pair of intelligent eyes. She often helped her grandfather pull people over to have him sing a song, and she was often successful. I was already a regular customer, paying two copper coins each time. I knew that the other people who were willing to give a few copper coins were also doing it for the girl's pleasing demeanor, definitely not because they wanted to listen to the old man's falsetto "Meng Jiangnü Seeking Her Husband"—such a vulgar tune, and sung by an old man with white hair.</p>
<p>The two of them, grandfather and granddaughter, wandered around like that every day, enduring hardships regardless of wind or rain. But can people living in the alleyway lead peaceful lives? The old man's granddaughter suddenly fell ill and died. Relying on his song "Meng Jiangnü Seeking Her Husband," he could scream his throat raw, but no one would ask him to sing. Although some people sighed for him,—sighs are not bread!</p>
<p>One night, the old man stopped singing after "The First Month." It was a night of drizzling rain. In this remote corner of the city, there were very few passersby. Who knows whether he couldn't bear the cold or was weakened by hunger and fainted on the street. It wasn't until two hours later, when someone outside was making a commotion, that a worker who lived in the alleyway with the old man discovered him on his way home from his night shift.</p>
<p>Now, pity is useless to him. The money collected by the crowd at the time was just enough to pay for his coffin for the first day.</p>
<p>Indeed, people should do something while they are alive, and eventually, there will be a day when they die. But what did that old man do while he was alive? Perhaps he had already done his best when he was young! This we cannot know. He is now just a street singer, and dying like that is not the most despicable thing. Then, why does his shadow still linger deeply in my mind? I cannot answer myself. Probably my brain has been ruined by reading again. I hope to forget those unnecessary impressions and do a little more myself before I die.</p>
<h3>Gambling</h3>
<p>— Huibo</p>
<p>The sky wore a gloomy face, and soon snowflakes began to flutter down to earth.</p>
<p>Farm wives fear snow the most, because when their husbands have nothing to do, they go to gamble. In the past, losing a thousand or eight hundred coins didn't matter much. She could make up for it by working a couple of extra evenings, spinning two pounds of cotton. But that doesn't work anymore. The price of one *dou* of grain has risen to the price of three. There's no way. Besides, young people have no sense. Although Mrs. Liu Gui is old, Xiao Jin is already sixteen. That little girl is so charming, and that kind of business is a family tradition. I heard that Director Wang slept with her one night and rewarded her with twenty silver dollars, praising her for being sensible without end. I can't let my husband be seduced by her too.</p>
<p>"Aren't you cold? The wind is so strong!" Li Cheng's wife brought grass to the cow and returned to nestle in her husband's arms, asking with a smile.</p>
<p>"Don't be frivolous. I know, you're afraid I'll..."</p>
<p>"Then why throw good money into that den of whores? If you don't gamble..."</p>
<p>She used the tone she had when she was a girl, wanting to scold her husband a bit, but she couldn't bring herself to do it.</p>
<p>The next day, Li Cheng paced around the house. His wife had specially lit some fire for him, burning a pile of rice husks and cypress branches. Wisps of white smoke dissipated, and his wife was giving him an enchanting smile!</p>
<p>"Bird cock! You're a slut." He cursed in his heart without paying her any attention. Immediately, a sound came, like dominoes, like dice, or like the hoarse voice of Master Ma when playing cards.</p>
<p>"Oh!" He saw Master Ma playing a six *wan*, hoping for a single four *wan*. Terrible, how could a good hand be played like that? He hurried to stop him.</p>
<p>The white smoke was still swirling, scattering into a lovely, smiling face. He saw clearly that it was Xiao Jin. Her eyelids covered watery, affectionate eyes looking at him. He felt shy, like a child being embarrassed.</p>
<p>"What?" His wife looked at him in shock.</p>
<p>He woke up, took his dry tobacco pipe from his mouth: said nothing, and strolled out.</p>
<p>The crisp sound of rustling snow accompanied his steps. A quarter of an hour later, he walked into Mrs. Gui's house.</p>
<p>"Quick! Bring a stool for your Uncle Li to sit on." Mrs. Gui's lips were painted as red as a monkey's bottom, her eyes smiling into slits.</p>
<p>Xiao Jin smiled and handed over a square stool. A pot-bellied stove was blazing with flames, and the water inside was bubbling with heat! Everything was warm. He looked at Xiao Jin, who was much prettier than before.</p>
<p>"Li Cheng must be afraid of his wife, afraid to even step out the door!"</p>
<p>Mrs. Gui laughed. The people playing cards also laughed. Xiao Jin laughed even harder, leaning into her mother's arms.</p>
<p>"Don't be afraid! You dared to come gamble today," Zhang Gouwa shouted triumphantly.</p>
<p>"Uncle Li! Just play one round and see what your sister-in-law will do to you." Xiao Jin pulled on one of his hands.</p>
<p>"No! I can't play mahjong." He argued embarrassedly.</p>
<p>"I'll watch for you—go!"</p>
<p>"Never mind him, saying he's afraid is just saying he's afraid!"</p>
<p>"Xiao Jin, don't give him any more rice soup; it's obvious he doesn't dare to come!" Zhang Gouwa teased Xiao Jin.</p>
<p>"Give it to your mother's x. If your sister gave it to you every day..."</p>
<p>"Ha, ha... ha!..." Everyone in the room laughed.</p>
<p>"Hey, play this card." Xiao Jin looked at him with enchanting eyes, her rosy little hand dropping cards that couldn't be kept together to the outside.</p>
<p>The cards were clacking, being played. A fragrant scent emanated from Xiao Jin's head, her eyes moving with a special expression.</p>
<p>At night, back home, his wife lay in his arms like a lamb. He repented! Hating himself for going to gamble, lamenting the eleven strings of cash he had lost! But at dawn, he was pacing in circles again, secretly cursing his wife. Thinking of Xiao Jin's smiling face, her enchanting scent; he secretly slipped out again while his wife wasn't there.</p>
<p>"Hey! Play this card!" Xiao Jin gave him an enchanting look with her slanting eyes, dropping the card with her rosy hand.</p>
<p>In Mrs. Gui's house, Master Ma, Zhang Gouwa, they were gambling again!</p>
<h3>The Wall</h3>
<p>— Shen Bing</p>
<p>The wall, with the loyalty of a martyr, patrols the perimeter of the house on its own, from day to night, and from night to day. The wall endures the bitter northwest wind, endures the charcoal drawings that the children paint on it; but it is proud, stopping passersby, stopping passing vehicles, and also stopping the greedy gazes that peer into the house.</p>
<p>During the day, the sunlight lingers at the foot of the wall, and the northwest wind no longer grabs at its chest. People then borrow the sunny spot by the wall, sitting in the sunlight. The shadows of winter smile on the old, bronze-gold robe, on the open books, on the wrinkles on the foreheads of the old people. The children's tops spin on the small patch of ground at the foot of the wall, spinning to the base of the wall, where the tops fall over like drunken people. In the evening, the sunlight on the wall gradually recedes.</p>
<p>At night, the old man lets out murmuring and meaningless sighs. The wall is completely shrouded in darkness. The northwest wind grabs at its chest with sharp claws, making rustling noises. The wall, with the loyalty of a martyr, guards the sleeping household, fighting with ill-intentioned nightwalkers, until it is covered in blood and its chest is torn to pieces.</p>
<p>The wall looks down on everything, because it patrols the perimeter of the house on its own, steadfast, brave, and proud.</p>

<p>The three brothers swore an oath of brotherhood in the Peach Garden. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei assisted in establishing meritorious service. At that time, they annihilated the Yellow Turban bandits and displayed their prowess at Hulao Pass. They had once drafted a plan in the Golden Palace. People called Emperor Uncle with gratitude and honor. The Emperor's blood letter in his belt order sought to eliminate the treacherous Cao Cao. Xuzhou fell into enemy hands, relying on Yuan Shao. The brothers happily reunited in the ancient city. Liu Bei lodged in Jingxiang at Liu Biao's place. He jumped the Tan Stream on horseback to escape the cage. Military advisor Dan Fu, Xu Yuanzhi. Once recommended the Crouching Dragon. Cai Yang was defeated and went to Eastern Wu. A million Cao soldiers were turned to ashes. Gained Jingzhou into the palm of his hand. The four prefectures and towns were looted. Zhou Yu could no longer tolerate it. A wonderful scheme of a beautiful woman was devised. Lu Su reluctantly became the matchmaker under the moon. First, he paid homage to Lord Qiao, the elder statesman Qiao. Zhao Yun waited closely to follow. There were three secret plans in the brocade pouch. Reaching the inner palace, Wu's Dowager Empress. Saw that the groom's demeanor was very rich and imposing. Returned to try the stone at Ganlu Temple. Secretly prayed to the heavens for her wishes. The couple took their accounts and went to Jingzhou. Recovered the eastern and western Shu roads. It is a pity that the seven hundred *li* of connecting camps. Let Lu Xun claim heroism for himself. The troops retreated to Yong'an Palace. The successor of forty years, the first and last lords. The Jin Dynasty ruled under unification. Ah Dou was still granted the title of Duke of Anle.</p>
<p>Cao Xiaoying's "Jade Dragonfly"</p>
<p>Central and Western (1040) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening: "Beautiful Woman Kite"</p>
<p>The spring breeze in February is new. The sound of the wind blowing down the step is empty. Looking up at the clouds and sky. There is a cloud ladder that can be climbed. I see him, a man of ten thousand *li* feeling happy and successful. Soaring straight up, driving the blue clouds. It's just that, the east wind intentionally lifts him up more. Showing off, completely different from the crowd. A piece of fairy skirt remains for the swallows. A few elegant melodies harmonize with the orioles. I really don't know, where is the flute playing and making sounds like jade sheng? This song is not originally from heaven. Everyone says, the beautiful woman is good at dancing and playing the zither. Try to look at that, fluttering like the shadow of a startled swan. Lightly like a flying swallow in the air. It is like, Cai Yan Wenji's Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute. It is like, Xiang Ling playing the zither resoundingly. It is like, Zhao Jun's lament on the Pipa. It is like, Hongxian stealing the box with talent and lightness. Let's see him, the plain silk is cut with thin sleeves. A gauze shirt as pure as dust. A pair of jade arms dance with the wind. Happily learning modern postures with lightness. It is all because of, the rascally playboy's frivolous appearance. Green Pearl is guarding against falling from the building. I'm afraid that, the willow branches are weak and powerless. Therefore, each red silk is tied to the foot rope. At times, the wind is crazy and upside down, flipping empty shadows. Acting as Yang Guifei emerging from the bath. It is not the true face of Lushan Mountain. Where can I find a soulmate? If it is that, one day falling into the dust. Stirring up, the cold eyes of many bystanders. So it is, stand firm without losing your footing. Take in the loose body and stop. Don't poke a hole in the paper tiger. Also guard against, sudden rain and stormy winds coming morning and evening. But originally, life in this world is just a dream. The wandering with the wind is like floating clouds. It's all the same, rising and falling together.</p>

<h3>The Amateur Players' Second Program, "The Thunderstorm," Premieres Today</h3>
<p>The third public performance of the Amateur Players Association has been ongoing for three days since its start. The first program was Leo Tolstoy's "The Power of Darkness." Although it has been raining for days, the box office success has exceeded all previous records of dramatic performances. Due to the tight schedule of various film companies and the contract relationship with theaters, each play is only decided to be performed for three days and will not be extended. The second program, "The Thunderstorm," will premiere today. This play is a famous work by Ostrovsky, a famous play that has been staged at the Soviet Drama Festival in previous years, and has been translated into more than seventy languages, occupying an extremely important position in world literature. The Soviet Union has also made it into a film. This play is now performed by amateur players, directed by Mr. Zhang Min, with the joint efforts of major actors such as Zhao Dan, Zheng Junli, Lan Ping, and Shu Xiuwen. Mr. Xian Xinghai is in charge of the musical accompaniment for the entire play. The four scenes of the entire play cost more than a thousand yuan. The scenery of the Volga River and the Russian atmosphere can be seen on the Chinese stage, which should be considered a pioneering work.</p>
<p>This play will also only be performed for three days. After three days, "Living in a Dream" directed by Shen Lingsong will be staged. The performance period in Shanghai is only nine days and will not be extended. All those who love drama should not miss it.</p>
<h3>Behind the Scenes at Lianhua Studio</h3>
<p>In "A Match Made in Heaven," Han Langen has many gags, especially when filming the scenery of the hot summer in this cold, harsh time. When the temperature drops below thirty degrees, Han sleeps naked on the streets of the poor, waving a palm fan, and repeatedly says it's hot! It's hot!</p>
<p>In "A Match Made in Heaven," Han Langen raised chickens when he had a job, and they laid many eggs every day. When he became unemployed, he waited for the chickens to lay eggs for meals, but the chickens would shake their heads at him. His beloved dog also disturbed him when he was asleep. He thought that the world was cold and indifferent, and even chickens and dogs would ridicule him.</p>
<p>During the filming of "Spring Comes to the World" in Hangzhou, Sun Yu led the staff in a short race from the lakeside to Lingyin Temple. The results were surprising. First, Liu Jiqun; second, Sun Yu; third, Chen Yanyan. The last place was Han Langen.</p>
<p>In He Mengfu's film "The General's Daughter," there is a scene of the general inspecting the troops. There were more than 10,000 soldiers being inspected. Just as General Heng Li was raising his eyebrows and stroking his beard, a bullet flew from the reviewing platform and exploded immediately. Li Zhuozhu was so frightened that her face turned pale, and she searched everywhere for the general, but he was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>Mei Lin in "The General's Daughter" is the daughter of the general's old servant. She is an innocent girl who is crushed because she cannot withstand the general's oppression. Mei Lin's performance of this role is well suited to the identity of an innocent girl.</p>

<h3>Looking Down on People With Dog Eyes</h3>
<p>Looking down on people with dog eyes, this sentence originally referred to dogs, but now, some people who act like dogs are really like dogs!</p>
<p>Ge Furong and Weng Shirong were originally two servants who raised dogs in Tianyi's new film "Wealth and Prosperity," so their accountant looked down on them. But one day, they actually won the first prize in the aviation lottery. They went to the master to redeem the prize, and the master wrote a check for 100,000 yuan. When they went to the accountant to get the money, the accountant not only refused to give them the money, but also insulted them. Later, the master's phone call proved that it was true, so he flattered them in every possible way. This is called "looking down on people with dog eyes"!</p>
<h3>"Sunrise" to Be Staged</h3>
<p>1937 may be called the year of drama! Because at the beginning, what particularly caught our attention was the activity of the theatrical circles, the organization of large and small theater companies, and the continuous public performances. This phenomenon is unprecedented in Shanghai, and there has never been such a rise in the history of Chinese drama.</p>
<p>Recently, the "Drama Work Society's" "Sunrise" is also about to be staged soon. The author of this play, Cao Yu, is the most outstanding Chinese playwright of recent times. His first creation, "Thunderstorm," is still warmly loved by many audiences. This second masterpiece, "Sunrise," has been completed under the guidance of director Ouyang Yuqian and the hard work of all the members of the "Drama Work Society." According to reliable sources, the premiere of "Sunrise" can be roughly realized in early February, and the premiere location will be at the Carlton Grand Theatre.</p>
<p>I remember the writer Mao Dun said: "Sunrise" is a great harvest for the current theater scene. I only hope that it will be staged quickly and meet the society sooner. Then this news is certainly something to be happy about.</p>
<p>"Sunrise" is a more stimulating, profound, and moving play than "Thunderstorm." Coupled with the excellent performance of the "Drama Work Society," the success on stage can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Tidbits from Yi Hua</h3>
<p>After Zhu Qiuhen completed "Elastic Daughter," Yi Hua decided to hire her as a basic actor due to Zhu's excellent performance, and she will play one of the main roles in Pan Zinong's self-edited "Flowers Bloom and Flowers Fade."</p>
<p>The New Metropolitan Ballroom, which occupies the entire studio, is decorated in a magnificent and imposing style. It looks down on the film industry, and the music team of the largest ballroom is invited to participate in the performance. At the same time, all the main actors of "Elastic Daughter" will perform together. The great scene of these few scenes alone has cost more than three thousand yuan. The production of "Elastic Daughter" is also a major film that cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The play "Double Lotus" by Yi Hua is about the young intellectuals' advocacy of free love and opposition to old-fashioned marriage. The content is written very vividly. Since the film started shooting, a lot has been completed.</p>
<p>Child actress Mou Ling and child star Prince Qing, who has a talent for comedy, performed together in "A Garden Full of Spring Colors" directed by Fang Peilin. They were greatly praised by Brother Fang and praised as promising little angels.</p>

<p>Automobile Special Issue</p>
<h3>The Sensational 1937 New Dodge in the Automobile Market</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The exhibition of the 1937 New Dodge car has indeed created a sensation in the local automobile industry. Since the new car was put on public display in the showroom of the local dealer, China Motors, not only automobile industry professionals have rushed to be among the first to see it, but even passersby stop to admire and praise it. One can imagine the beauty and magnificence of the new car, which is captivating.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman, General Manager of China Motors, recently told someone that the introduction of the 1937 New Dodge is indeed another great step forward in the glorious history of Dodge. As evidenced by the successful introduction of low-priced cars by the Dodge factory last year, this year's new products are even more welcomed by the world and will achieve even greater success. Although the new car is still in the low-price category, its value not only surpasses all previous Dodge products but is also comparable to general mid-price cars. The new car is divided into two major lines. One is the Dodge Six-Cylinder car, and the other is the Dodge Special Six-Cylinder car. The former is priced at four thousand four hundred yuan, and the latter is five thousand yuan. Although these two new products have slight differences in pricing, they are very similar in appearance. In addition to using an all-steel body, the six-cylinder car is also equipped with safety glass. As for the beautiful and elegant cushions, they are not inferior to the Special model. The touring car is equipped with a recessed wide luggage compartment. Furthermore, all doors are equipped with safety glass, and the front and rear sections are equipped with vents. As for the exquisite interior design, the advanced mechanical engineering, and the overall beautiful appearance, the 1937 New Dodge is superior in every aspect and clearly has its unique advantages.</p>
<p>Both the Dodge Six-Cylinder car and the Dodge Special Six-Cylinder car are the crystallization of Dodge's entire manpower, material resources, and perfect mechanical engineering. The car body, including the roof, is made of all steel, and the roof is an integral part of the entire structure. The top, bottom, left, right, front, and rear of the car are completely integrated, as seamless as a heavenly garment. Its strength and solidity are far greater than before, and its safety and reliability are unparalleled.</p>
<p>The features of the 1937 New Dodge are too numerous to mention. In summary, it is more spacious, more comfortable, safer, and has an improved and perfect streamlined style. The slender and beautiful antenna enhances its beauty and makes it more pleasing to the eye. As for durability and economical fuel consumption, these are the advantages that Dodge has always had, and this year's new products are even more outstanding. It is said that the new car is beautiful and perfect in every aspect, and its price still belongs to the low-price category. Therefore, it is inevitable that it will cause a sensation in the automobile industry.</p>
<h3>Comfortable and Spacious Seats</h3>
<p>The features of the 1937 new car, in addition to beauty and safety, are the comfortable and spacious seats. The ability to adjust the driver's seat to various angles is a given, and the rear seat is also much wider. The left picture shows the rear seat of the new Packard car. Even with a child lying on it, there is still plenty of room.</p>

<h3>The 1937 New Studebaker Arrives in Shanghai (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>As far as the car body is concerned, the new Studebaker is truly the crystallization of the full thought and talent of the factory's engineering experts. Whether in terms of style, safety, or comfort, the new car is outstanding and perfectly meets the needs of automobile enthusiasts. Regarding appearance, the most notable feature of the new car is its novel, beautiful, magnificent, and aesthetically pleasing new radiator grille. Its front and sides complement each other in a very natural way. Therefore, its appearance is not only slender and beautiful but also elegant and luxurious, very pleasing to the eye, and extremely lovely. The windshield, car neck, and rear of the car are all excellent, and the streamlined beauty of the entire car is further enhanced. The absence of any attachments on the outside of the car body is also one of the advantages of the new car, as such devices can hinder the passage of air through the body and the symmetry of the overall design.</p>
<p>The fenders are made in one piece and are closely connected to the radiator section. The headlights are positioned higher, projecting light further. All hardware is artistic and very streamlined. The fenders have also been carefully redesigned to reduce wind resistance. The luggage compartment is embedded in the car, becoming an integral part of the overall design, rather than an added attachment. The wheels are solid disc type. The bumper is both practical and visually impressive. The entire engine hood is locked in one place, making it easy to open and close without any noise. In short, the new Studebaker is virtually a magnificent and beautiful combination of aerodynamic efficiency.</p>
<p>As for all the features that contribute to comfort and convenience, the interior of the new car has everything. But the most important of these is its spaciousness. The new car has tall doors and increased legroom. As for the luggage space, its width and capacity are unmatched by vehicles in the same price category. For example, in the four-door sedan, the rear seat legroom reaches 47 inches. The front and rear doors are 44 inches high from top to bottom. The 18-gallon fuel tank has been redesigned into a flat shape. As the height of the tank is reduced, the floor of the luggage compartment can be lowered, and parts can be recessed under the floor of the luggage compartment. Thus, the retrieval of parts is more convenient, and the luggage space is more spacious. The luggage compartment of the touring sedan, including the spare tire, now has a capacity of 17.4 cubic feet. The touring sedan has 22 cubic feet. Such spaciousness is rare in the same price category.</p>
<p>The new car's standard equipment includes a bumper jack for easy lifting. The taillights are equipped with reflectors, so they are effective even when the lights are not on. The windshield is equipped with an improved ventilation system that is a foot taller than the previous one. The driver's view is clearer. In addition, the visibility of the rearview mirror is much better than before. The front side windows are divided into two halves. Regardless of whether the rear half is raised or lowered, the driver can rotate the front half at will to let in air. All windows are insulated with rubber, so there is no worry of gaps or noise. With these features and the ventilation device on the hood, the new car can enjoy the benefits of ventilation in many ways to enhance the pleasure of driving.</p>
<p>The rotary door latch is another feature of the new Studebaker. With just a flick of the finger, the door can be turned on and closed automatically. All movements of the car are sufficient to make it close even tighter, and all noises due to loosening can be avoided. The door handle style is easier to grip and curves towards the car body, so there is no worry of tearing the cuffs or any part of the clothing. The anti-freeze device is also a feature of the new car. Two ducts are embedded on top of the dashboard, with the openings just below the back of the windshield. These ducts can be connected to a heater. As long as a heater is installed in the car, hot air is continuously transported upward, and the inside and outside of the windshield will never freeze. Although the floor of the new car has been lowered, the position of the seat cushions remains the same, so the seats in the car are like high-backed chairs, making you feel more comfortable. The two-door sedan is now equipped with upright seats. Compared to ordinary folding seats, it is more comfortable, as can be imagined.</p>
<p>The entire outer shell of the 1937 New Studebaker car, whether the roof, floor, ends, or sides, is made of all steel, with no wood mixed in. The steel roof is made of a single piece of steel, which is unique in the automotive industry, and is cleverly insulated from all noise. Therefore, the Studebaker car body is virtually a safe steel cabinet. As for the interior, it fully demonstrates the artistic talent of Ms. Helen Dryden, a famous design expert in New York. The excellence of her work can be seen in the 1936 President series car. The interior decoration of the new car is elegant and unparalleled. The colors of the cushions vary according to the depth of the car body color, which is appropriate and very pleasing to the eye. The window trim is generally matched with the dashboard, and the addition of chrome hardware makes it more magnificent, splendid, and upscale. The steering wheel horn button and gear lever are also matched with the dashboard. The dial is redesigned with a new style that is easy to read day or night. The radio and clock, if installed, are also harmoniously integrated with the dashboard. The ashtray is embedded in the partition and has become an integral part of the overall design. The ease of driving, the comfort of riding, and the pleasure that can be enjoyed in the new Studebaker car are so outstanding and unparalleled because of the latest equipment and devices mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Full View of the Front of the New Buick</h3>
<p>The abundance of beautiful elements in the 1937 new car is almost unprecedented in various types of cars before. It is neither excessively streamlined and sharp, nor does it lack in sophistication. It has a kind of light, clear, and beautiful appearance that has never been seen before. The picture shows the front of the new Buick car. All radiators, bumpers, and headlights have been redesigned with a new look.</p>

<h3>Overseas Automotive News</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Quantity of Steel Used in Automobile Manufacturing Steel is the main raw material in automobile manufacturing. According to the estimate of Mr. Klaus, General Engineer of the Great Lakes Steel Corporation of Michigan, USA, the amount of steel used in automobiles in 1937 will be 6,000,000 tons. The number of automobiles is estimated to be 4,500,000. The use of steel in automobiles in the new cars of 1937 will be greater than before. Several manufacturers have decided to use steel completely for the roof and other parts, so as to achieve the greatest success in terms of safety. The car body, which used to be half steel and half wood, has now been decided to be changed to pure steel. This alone can greatly increase the amount of steel used. According to statistics, the annual income of the United States is $40,000,000,000, of which 1.4% is used to purchase automobiles. When the income is $80,000,000,000, the consumption for purchasing automobiles is 4.1%. Mr. Wilson, Vice President of General Motors, said at the recent annual meeting of steel engineers that this increase is due to the high increase in the value of automobile products. Automobile manufacturing has done its best to improve the quality of automobile products and strive to keep prices low. Detroit is the center of the world's automobile manufacturing industry and also the city with the largest amount of steel used in the world. The relationship between steel consumption and automobile manufacturing can be seen here.</p>
<p>▲ 1937 Model Willys The new car of Willys-Overland Company will soon be launched. Although the details have not yet been disclosed, it is reported that the price of this new car will be approximately US$100. The car is completely standardized in production. The width and height are appropriate. It can travel about 35 miles per gallon of gasoline and 1,200 miles per quart of oil. According to Mr. Wilson, General Manager of the company, distributors have already ordered 50,000 vehicles.</p>
