<h3>首都展開空前血戰</h3>
<p>日方認攻取南京實非易事　外電傳中華門有被攻破說　其他攻城日軍經壓迫後退</p>
<p>本埠外人方面消息、昨日首都戰事之激烈、實為前此所未有、中華門有已被日軍攻破說、但尚難證實、至其他各門攻城日軍、因受我軍强烈抵禦、均稍向後退云、</p>
<p>［東京］據朝日新聞訪員稱、昨晚南京中日兩軍、爭奪東南城垣、澈夜血戰、情形之激烈、為有史以來所未見、日軍在華軍猛烈抵抗之下、力圖擴大其在東南門內所獲面積一百米突之據點、並佔領紫金山孫中山陵墓附近華軍之堅强陣地、觀於各報所載消息、並未提及戰事之進展、戰況之激烈、可略窺一班、據日本某通訊社隨同日軍在南京東南門作戰之訪員電稱、今晨九時、日空軍數隊、密集轟炸城垣·城門·以及城內華軍陣地、歷一小時許、俾可突破華軍之防禦云、同時東京及其他各城市、對於日軍之攻入南京、均擧行慶祝、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［東京］據各報接訊、南京各門之大戰、終日進行不已、日軍曾用轟炸機砲隊甚至高射砲、希圖擊破東南城垣、垣外日軍藉高地砲隊猛烈轟擊之掩護、已佔據中華門、但他處日軍因求其砲隊與飛機便於轟炸計、均已稍向後退、東京與名古屋均擧行提燈會、慶祝勝利、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨日（十一日）據日軍情報處主任對日新聞訪員聲稱、攻取南京實非易事、日軍雖已佔有該城之一隅、尚不能謂已佔據南京、要知南京自北至南、長達五哩、自西至東、長達三哩、尺土皆經固守、四周繚以高十五米達深十米達之堅垣、垣外且有廣二十米達之深壕、而諸湖亦足為日軍進攻之天然障碍、故攻取南京、實非易事也云、</p>
<h3>我軍拚死保衛南京</h3>
<p>［漢口］日軍於過去四十八小時中、雖藉飛機大砲及坦克車之助、向南京各城門猛攻、但因守城華軍咸抱必死决心、奮勇抵禦、迄未得逞、截至十一日午夜止、南京城廂仍在華軍據守中、據外人方面接得消息、十一日午後、日軍進攻城垣益烈、日機轟炸亦猛、落在城廂之砲彈及炸彈、當在五百枚以上、致城中火燄衝天、華軍雖在陸空猛烈夾攻之下、仍拚死迎敵、有進無退、其忠勇壯烈、令人欽佩、據十一日晚中國政府發言人表示、保衛南京之華軍、必戰至最後一人而後已、外傳華軍已放棄南京之說、絕對不確、截至十一日傍晚、南京仍在華軍固守中、華軍各據點、佈置堅固之工事、凖備於日軍突破城垣入城時、與之作猛烈巷戰、總之、日軍若欲佔領南京、必須作出重大之代價而後可、（十二日快訊社電）</p>
<p>南京紫金山被日軍佔領、十一日騎兵軍檀自新部師師長王鎮淮、率部由後方夾攻、日軍死傷千餘人、王彈中左肩、亦受輕傷、（華東社）</p>
<h3>外人重視堅强抵抗</h3>
<p>［巴黎］關於中日兩國戰事、急進社會黨“共和報”頃載稱、“東京方面、企待南京陷落消息、已三日於茲、南京四郊迄今猶在血戰之中、於以見日軍業已遭受意外的抵抗、“中國當局旣已拒不媾和、未來局勢如何發展、殊難加以臆測、特日本經濟情形、旣不許戰事遷延不决、該國文武兩派、又非水乳交融、則華軍堅守南京之擧、至堪重視、吾人務當密切加以注意明矣、”（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］此間軍事專家表示、蔣介石將軍若能於日軍包圍南京以前、將大軍撒往內地、則雖與沿海一帶斷絕交通、並缺乏兵工廠等之設備、但實力存在、當能繼續為長期之抗戰、反之、蔣介石將軍在南京之二十萬大軍、若未能於事前撤退其主要部份、而受日軍之包圍、則南京之陷落、必將使中國方面感受極大之打擊、此後能否繼續爲長期之抗戰、將成一大疑問、（按中國軍隊主力、現已撤往內地、現在留守南京者、不過其一小部隊、雖事抗戰、無非欲向日軍索取奪城之代價耳、亦唯如是、故中國之長期抗戰、當然不成問題、）（十二日國民社電）</p>
<h3>張羣在漢發表重要談話</h3>
<p>政府决心繼續抗戰　一切辦法早經擬妥</p>
<p>［漢口］中國前任外交部長現任中央政治會議秘書長張羣、昨晚接見此間海通社代表、發表重要談話、宣稱、“中國政府决心繼續抗戰、卽使南京失陷、亦决不動搖、”張氏力言、自中日戰事爆發之初、中國政府卽深知戰爭必為長期、早作一切必要之凖備、足以與日本作數年之周旋、中國現時、旣無人力缺乏之憂、更無財政短少之虞、一切傷亡人員、均由數月來訓練完成之後備軍、立卽補充、海通社代表當局問如果南京失陷後中國政府之凖備步驟、可得聞乎、張氏答稱、一切最後辦法之計劃、早經擬訂完妥、但其可以見告者、卽中國政府希望日軍向南昌方面、深入西南、沿津浦鐵路、移師北指、則當可遭遇組織完備華軍之堅强抵抗也、張氏繼稱、中政府預料日軍攻陷南京後、必將籌組“偽政府”、而假藉人民公意為口實、但卽使日軍以武力强迫組織成立、中國全國人民、對於此項“傀儡組織”、亦當以一切方法、共同聲討、張氏承認中日戰事之期限、此時尚難預言、但如中國迫不得已、則絕對能够支持數年之戰爭、此種長期抵抗之决心、卽日方失敗之可能、海通代表繼問中國人民是否將武裝起來、從事游擊戰、張氏答曰、“此卽最近第八路軍總指揮所提議者、中國政府、深知此種計劃實現之危險、故卽使實行“武裝民衆”、亦必出以嚴格限制之辦法、”最後張氏表示、希望列强對於中國為正義公理而為純粹抵抗之戰爭、應一致加以贊助、（十二日國民海通社電）</p>
<h3>胡佛號輪乘客無恙</h3>
<p>［香港］今日下午此間大來公司經理人得訊、胡佛總統號現為東北狂風所危、惟乘客全數平安無恙、現僅留少數海員於船、今晨經理人曾與該船通無綫電未果、當時恐該船之無綫電機已不能活動、或留船之人、已全下船也、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［香港］此間大來公司經理韋爾森、今晨曾擬以無綫電與在台灣某島外擱淺之胡佛總統號通訊、但卒未成功、可見胡佛總統號之無綫電訊、業已損壞、或該船巳被拋棄矣、日本打撈船一艘、將載韋爾森立卽開往肇事地點、此外尚有一日本打撈船、亦將由日木駛往該島、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>日機又襲廣九路</h3>
<p>英德韶關均被轟炸　圍洲島有日軍登陸</p>
<p>［香港］十二晨八時、日機二飛廣九路林村投四彈去、九時十分、十二架分由赤溪唐家灣起飛、向廣九路各站投二十八彈、同時日機十二架由赤溪飛粵路連江口英德韶關、投四五十彈、一時十五分、復有八架襲廣九路、傳日艦九日到圍洲島、派兵登陸、窺伺北海、台山縣府十二日電告、十日·十一日汽船多艘、載兵圖在下川島西南角偷渡登陸、為我保安隊擊退、泊漭洲日艦砲轟村舍、殘毁頗多、十二晨日機三架到下川窺伺、用機槍掃射、平民死傷甚多、我保安隊扼守要隘、嚴陣以待、日艦一在三洲掩護水兵、在北風灣登陸、我保安隊伏山林中還擊、戰一小時、日軍潰退云、上川附近之圍洲島航圍甲等小島均為日佔、（十二日專電）</p>
<h3>日兵巡邏界外築路</h3>
<p>大陸報云、日發言人昨日接見新聞訪員時切實宣稱、日兵現巳巡邏界外築路、諸路前均由華警與保安團巡邏、今由日兵接管、實不足為異、發言人又謂、就渠所知、日兵經過外兵防區而達滬西時、未接該國軍事當局抗議、</p>
<h3>華北各陣綫沉寂</h3>
<p>日機轟炸我軍陣地　我游擊隊活躍異常</p>
<p>⊙新鄕　據今日此間所接華人消息、華北各陣綫現皆沉寂、日人刻正在其所已佔據區域從事於行政機關之組織、並應付中國第八路軍與孫殿英部遊擊隊之屨次襲擊、晋南日軍已撤至東晋與北晋、以期保護平綏平漢與正太三鐵路、第八路軍共有五六萬人、散處於冀豫晋三省邊界之太行山中及娘子關平型關附近、孫殿英部共有一萬五千人、分佈於滹沱河南北兩岸、及行唐·靈壽·石家莊·順德一带、此種游擊隊日則隱伏、夜則出襲、使日軍疲於奔命、華北陣綫日軍之唯一活動、僅以飛機為限、蓋日機無日不轟炸華軍陣地也、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［北平］聞平漢路高碑店西面易縣附近與冀晋邊境之涞源縣、日來均有戰事、蓋因該方面之山地、仍有小隊忠勇華軍繼續抗禦日軍之進攻也、平漢路石家莊與彰德間之日軍、日來調動頻繁、係有賡續南犯模樣、（十二日快訊社電）</p>
<h3>外蒙允助我抗戰</h3>
<p>［漢口］據中央社消息、外蒙古已允許在軍事上援助中國抗禦日本、該政府之代表二人、現已經過西安、大約日內卽抵達重慶、向中央當局報告一切、（十二日快訊社電）</p>

<p>［香港］中國海關巡艦“嘉星”號（譯音）、昨在香港口外之中國領海中、與日本驅逐艦一艘相遇、被日艦開砲擊中後、卽向英國領海疾駛、遂在香港著名海浴塲所在之砲台峯地方攔淺、船員卽由該處登陸、晚間有日驅逐艦所派之汽船兩艘駛至、將該巡艦拖至中國領海、並用其本身之汽力、隨日驅逐艦駛去、按該巡艦之船長、係英人寇克氏、（十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>日軍深入內地愈增作戰困難</h3>
<p>拿破崙往事可為殷鑒　石井說明日對華政策　英報信中國民族主義發揚　終必能戰勝軍事空前浩劫</p>
<p>［倫敦］日本親善專使石井今日接見“星期泰晤士報”訪員時、略述日本在華之目的、包括對付蔣委長之態度、與列强之利益在內、據謂日軍在華並不欲佔據土地、或佔據如海南島等之島嶼、列强若長此維持嚴格之中立態度、則日本擬繼續尊重列强在華之權益、此為日本政策之兩大主要點、石井續日、余信南京陷落後、日軍不致追蔣深入中國內地、日軍如果出此、則恐將蹈拿破侖在莫斯科之覆轍、惟日本與蔣議和之前、日軍必佔據南京、至於中國各地行政、如地方官願與日本合作、則將仍由彼等管理、惟蔣如拒絕與日木議和、則日軍將長駐所獲各地、而向地方征稅以充軍實、余敢决蔣介石將軍卽不為個人利益計、而為中國利益計、不久必被迫請和、蔣介石將軍今與蘇聯之關係甚形密切、但蘇聯今僅能由天空助之、蘇聯軍火運至重慶、需時數月、蔣旣無軍火又乏軍餉、自不得不及時罷戰、惟蔣或將為中國共產主義張目、但余不欲指蔣本人為共產黨員、石井次述及蘇聯、謂日軍事當局固最注意蘇聯、但渠以為蘇聯目下正有內訌、實不能在遠東運用强有力之手腕、訪員詢以外國在華之權益、石井答稱、以海關稅收抵付外債、與夫上海工部局權力所根據之地皮章程、仍將受日本之尊重、中華全國目下讐對日本、中國商人不敢與日人貿易、但渠信和局奠定後、貿易必將復興、渠意中國將來或將變更對日之情緒、日本之唯一目的、厥在造成友好之中國、此指中國全部而言、石井末謂、日本因未向中國宣戰、故未要求交戰國之權利、因此無法律立塲、申請列强勿以軍火售與中國、但曾通告法國、如繼續取道越南運輸軍火入華、則日飛機或將被迫轟炸由河內經邊界而北達雲南、與東至南寗之法國鐵路云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］星期泰晤士報外交訪員聲稱、石井談片中所發言論、必得日政府充分認可、實無甚疑義、石井此次至倫敦之使命、顯多困難、蓋駐華英大使許閣森爵士之遭射擊、無惡於日之英兵之遭擊斃、經營和平商業之英船之遭轟炸、陸地英人產業之遭摧毁、均為最近之事、英人尚未遺忘、中國維持獨立之機會、當就遠見而不得就短見以論之、一般人士現仍相信中國之民族主義、終必戰勝軍事之浩刦、石井重申日本尊重外國權利之保證、周為人所歡迎、但食物之味、必於到口之後始能信其美惡、徒詡其美、殊無益也、日本固不欲佔據中國之土地、但日本欲擬用“滿洲國”之前例、如法泡製、造成傀儡式之政府、然卽此一擧、為功已匪易矣、戰後一切捐稅勢必增重、因之物價高漲、商業或將衰落、人民必不堪受此擔負也、石井談話中曾用“嚴格中立”之詞句、試問日本一旦如在平津滬寗建成傀儡政府、英國拒絕承認、日本其將視為危害嚴格之中立乎、英國一日遭遇當蔣委員長仍控制粵省及南部各省時、將否承認中國後此之變動問題、則必牽涉重要之事件、該訪員之結語曰、英國一日置身國聯、則承認土地變更、必須在國聯機構內為之、故今後糾紛實方興未艾也云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>美應付遠東時局將採“巨棒”政策</h3>
<p>恃海軍為外交後盾　國際條約務求尊重</p>
<p>［華盛顿］羅斯福總統之統治、行將對外採取“大棍棒”之政策、今日已露其端倪、國務院官員現多屬望其勢力日漸雄厚之海軍、作其外交政策上有力之支持、彼等最近與海陸兩部互相交換意見之結果、深信美國之對外政策、尤其對於遠東之政策、不久卽可趨於强硬、三部人員之意見以為美國對於條約之遵守與尊重、已有充分之表現、今後所應採之步驟、卽在請他國覆行其條約義務、同時以武力作此項政策之支持、唯國務卿赫爾認目前時機尚未成熟、故應稍安毋燥、但和平之利益與戰爭之禍害、確應繼續設法曉喻世界也、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>江陰要塞失陷經過</h3>
<p>東戰塲壯烈戰史的一頁</p>
<p>長江第一重門戶的江陰要塞失陷了、然而因為電訊的隔斷、交通的梗阻、關於、當時戰前戰後的各種狀況、當為一般人所關心、何況那裏偉大的戰跡、又是不可消滅的重要史實呢、江陰旅滬同鄕會為着要明瞭江陰的眞實情况、曾於戰前戰後、先後派遣幹員十五人、前往江陰實地調查、業已陸續返滬、記者特為綜合各人實地調查所得情形、作一個有系統的報告、</p>
<p>歷史上的偉蹟</p>
<p>江陰在現在是國防第一個要塞、然而它在歷代的英雄名將眼中、對於這蒼老的古城、都沒有把它忘懷而忽略、在那裹不知流過多少壯士的碧血、埋下多少健兒的白骨、尤其在明末淸初的時候、民族英雄閻海元、統率數千江陰子弟、誓死不降滿奴、被圍孤城中死守、抵禦二十萬衆的淸軍、血戰達八十餘日之久、終於糧盡援絕、偉大而悲壯地同這古城偕亡、造成了這可歌可泣的史實、至今二百數十年來、國人還沒有糢糊、</p>

<p>江陰的形勢、北枕長江、東有巫山段山為屏、西有蕭山靑山為障、南靠秦望山大小茅山為前哨、一面臨江、三面山崗起伏、把這江陰深藏在衆山環抱的中間、如此雄壯的形勢、深得地利天險之勝、江陰要塞、構築在黃山君山、北對靖江、彼此呼應、電雷學校和飛機塲、也附設在要塞地帶裹、並且還有武澄·鍚澄·琴澄·等三條公路及其他支綫、交通便利、工商實業也相當發達、因為它有地利天險關係、不但在過去為兵家必爭之地、就是在近代內戰中、也沒有一次不與這古城握手、發生過若干關係、</p>
<p>盡成一片瓦礫</p>
<p>自從“八一三”全面抗戰展開、淞滬一隅之地、經過三個月的血戰、東戰塲戰綫西移、上月二十一日、日機十餘架盤旋江陰上空、首次投彈轟炸、嗣後日機每天飛來擲彈、最初如吳汀鷺住宅·縣政府·利用紗廠等悉被炸毀、旋於北門街一帶大施慘炸、如南菁學院·顧家埭·善門路·大宜春·小橋頭·以及同生泰·日新恒等各大商號、盡成一片瓦礫、實深浩嘆、當時日軍艦隊、集中於福山以東的、約達七八十艘、環攻段山、隆隆砲聲漸漸震撼江陰、時為上月二十日至二十四日的情形、日軍已在福山登岸、日艦砲火也已射入江陰縣境的東鄕了</p>
<p>日艦遭受重創</p>
<p>戰事從常熟侵入了江陰區內、江陰情勢、日見吃緊、江陰全境、大軍雲集、日機每天來犯、却被我高射砲迎擊、祇在高空中投彈、我江防總司令劉興、江防司令許康、耍塞司令歐陽駒、均親赴前綫指揮、城內治安、歸由戒嚴副司令袁縣長負責維持、率同壯丁、担任輸送·救護等工作、秩序井然、有條不紊、城內居民十九向江北遷避、我黃山要塞、不久也開砲應戰、轟然巨響、震動大江兩岸、同時各山砲台、也突起轟擊、日艦中彈頗多、其中二艘沉沒、十數艘受傷、於是日艦不敢逼近我砲火射程之內、</p>
<p>遭陸海空圍攻</p>
<p>不久無錫常州、相斷淪陷、日軍除了艦隊密集砲火的猛轟、和大隊日機的慘炸以外、並聯合其陸軍三路進犯、東路由常熟進犯周莊市·長砂山一帶、西路由武進（卽常州）經由夏港·迫肅山·靑山、這路戰事最為劇烈、這裹係由廣西部隊防守、奮勇抵禦、前仆後繼、雙方傷亡、却很重大、民衆為流彈所傷者、為數極多、但日軍憑其飛機·大砲·戰車·傾全力進犯、終於我桂軍二營之衆、死守二山不退、均作壯烈之犧牲、南路由無錫沿錫澄公路進擾、經北渚·靑暘·與其東路由常熟方面進犯之日軍會合、再越日橋南閘、被日軍三面包圍、陷入孤軍苦戰、時為上月月底間的情形、</p>
<p>淪陷經過情形</p>
<p>十一日三十日、城內砲彈橫飛、因此大火延燒、黑烟冲霄、紅光燭天、自東門起至馬牌樓一帶、盡為濃烟烈燄所包圍、兼之前東北軍部隊、不戰而潰、城廂被迫、於本月一日失守、但我要塞駐軍、仍憑險發砲、與日軍作殊死戰、經二日夜的血戰、於本月三日下午、終於後援斷絕、萬餘孤軍乃殺出重圍、揮淚退守鎮江、但仍留一團之衆死守、於本月八日、仍在黃山要塞與日軍抗戰、凖備流此最後一滴血、向日軍索取其給付重大的代價、在八日傍晚、尚有時疏時密的槍砲聲、但至九日則已寂靜無聲、想已壯烈犧牲、與此要塞偕亡了、總之、江陰要塞的失陷、絕非日軍的大隊軍艦攻進、實由於三面重圍的絕援、和內部東北軍的不戰而潰所致、否則、或許江陰要塞尚在我孤軍死守中呢、</p>
<p>失陷以後種種</p>
<p>這次江陰我軍的撤退、確比蘇常一帶的撤退、有計劃、有秩序、最先將配備於江陰城東之我軍砲隊、密秘渡江、旋將各耍塞砲及各山砲台、逐一炸毀、以免轉資日軍所用、江中封鎖綫、現由日軍用小汽艇掃除、但因遭對江八圩港砲台轟擊、無法進行、日軍在九日之夜、渡江侵入對岸靖江、又與我軍發生激戰、據自本月十日晨由靖江逃出之江陰人某君、乘昨日由太古公司之蕪湖輪到滬談、靖江於十日之晨、還是在我軍之手、戰事發生於靖江縣城的東南郊外、泰興方面、我已調集大軍、防堵日軍沿江西進、封鎖綫內我軍所沉巨船、一時恐不能全部揥除、某君認為滬報所傳、日軍已經拆毁的話、似乎此說過早、</p>

<h3>墨索里尼宣布意大利退出國聯</h3>
<p>海陸空擁有强大兵力　堪與民治集團相頡抗</p>
<p>［羅馬］昨夜意相墨索里尼出現於維尼齊亞宮露台上、在十萬人狂呼聲中、宣布意國退出國聯、其言曰、吾人現脫離不事和平工作但圖戰爭之破廟、向前進行、無所惋惜、余為歷史·為意大利·為吾人之革命·作此重要宣布、某一國之代表一旦與日內瓦惡劣環境相接觸後、其所抱之好意、輒為之喪失、而日內瓦全為不利於意國之陰險淺陋的方面所包圍、在此情形之下、吾人之出現於日內瓦之門、不復可耐、今已屆吾人必須有所選擇之時期矣云、意相旋問曰、吾人其果應仍處於國聯中否、衆大聲答曰“否”、意相復問曰、吾人應退出國聯否、宮前十萬人復大聲曰“然”、意相繼稱、意國决定其態度、並未受任何歴力、柏林與東京守此軸心之同志、早已表示絕對智慮、此乃事實、今意國之脫離國聯、乃歷史上至有重要關係之事件、促起全世界之注意、其後果有未可預測者、意國之基本政策、吾人在過去數日中、已給予造成亞得里亞海和平之明證、（此語顯指意國與南斯拉夫間之諒解）時常發生之威脅言論、今後或又將發生於大民治國團者、不能使吾人稍有所動、彼等不能有所行動、以不利於意大利人民、因意大利人民能擔任任何犧牲也、吾人有海陸空之武器、不獨衆多、且經經兩次勝戰之試騐、其尤高於一切者、吾人愛國之革命精神、非世界武力所能摧毀也云、</p>
<p>外相齊亞諾於墨索里尼發言後、卽電致國聯秘書長愛文諾、文曰、依據法西斯最高行政會之决議、余茲為閣下吿者、自一九三七年十二月十一日起、意國脫離國聯云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］一般人咸信意日德三國接近之後、已使法西斯國家與日內瓦方面意見日深、墨氏雖仍聲言努力和平、然其外交政策、或將一變而為聯絡意大利之與國在地中海設防、以備將來與英法作戰、同時意德二國、大概將力勸諸小國、亦放棄國聯、而參加反共集團、其中以南斯拉夫最受注意云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］今日據權威方面消息、意相墨索里尼於退出國聯之後、當將正式宣佈意大利成為帝國、溯自意軍佔領阿比西尼亞京城以來、意王愛麥虞限卽兼有阿比西尼亞皇帝之尊號、此後或將改稱為意大利皇帝、若干方面咸稱意國欲改為帝國、當可免除他國不肯承認意王兼為阿皇之困難、尚有一說則謂墨氏不久卽將辭去其首相職位、以讓其婿齊亞諾伯爵、惟此說尚難證實、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>羅馬廣塲景象一瞥</h3>
<p>［羅馬］今晚法西斯黨最高會議開會、數小時前、城中心區各處街道、尤其是威尼斯宮首相宮邸附近、卽已人出人海、雖大雨傾盆、亦不散去、官邸前廣塲雷炬照耀、有如白晝、廣塲中心、由法西斯黨軍駐守、四週各大道均臨時停止交通、全城各處劇塲、電影院均於晚間八時休業、咖啡店與餐館則然無人、種種景象、與去年五月九日宣佈意大利帝國成立之時約略相同、法西斯黨最高會議各委員、均於開會之前、絡繹進入威尼斯宮、其時威尼斯廣塲上、有軍樂隊數隊、輪流奏愛國歌曲、至八時五十五分、法西斯黨秘書長斯達拉斯、用無綫電廣播、令民衆靜默、並謂、最高會議業已開會、越五分鐘後首相墨索里尼出臨露台、民衆在大雨中、齊聲大呼“領袖”三聲、首相乃卽發表演說、（詞見前電）宣布意大利退出國聯會、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意國正式通知德日</h3>
<p>［東京］外務當局發表、十一日午後六時、意駐日大使館參事官史卡馬滋加至外務省、訪問井上歐亞局長、代表意大使述稱、根據本國政府訓令、意國政府於本日同時正式通吿國聯秘書長意大利退出國際聯盟、茲特通知日本帝國政府云、（十一日同盟電）</p>
<p>［柏林］關於意大利退出國聯會事、該國政府事先曾由外交途徑通吿德國、此間政界人士因而不以為異、并認為德國關於國聯會所推行之政策、具有充分理由、可於意國退盟一舉獲得證明、此在各觀察家并謂、國聯會未能適應現實情形、對於德意兩國軸心在歐洲方面所保有之潛勢力、未能了解及之、意國退盟、自屬意料中事、所望他國亦能步意國之後塵而相率退盟云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>蓋達著文抨擊國聯</h3>
<p>［羅馬］當法西斯最高會議正在開會、將决定宣佈退出國際聯盟之際、意大利新聞報主筆蓋達發表强硬社評、題曰、“擺脱日內瓦”、蓋氏首就日內瓦集體政策之弱點、與墨索里尼希特勒雙邊恊定之優越、比較論列、繼稱、“現已到達討論保持和平方法之時機、但國聯徒具組織、無補實際、旦從歷史上所得敎訓、集體主義根本與“和平政策”互相矛盾、决不能併存不悖、如必强勉行之、不但其結果不能歸於公平、抑且助長無窮戰禍”、蓋氏指陳國聯已有十五年歷史、一切國聯之武器如經濟制裁軍事制裁、僅施之於弱小國家、對於大而且富之列强不惟未敢施行、卽施行亦必歸於無効、因强國自軍事眼光言之、其經濟完全獨立也、因此制裁云者、曾能被强國利用、而不能用於强國、故曰不公平、且國聯盟約之實施、將使各個國家因曲折紆迥之關係、捲入無盡日之戰爭、而世界和平永不可得、故曰助長戰禍、有此兩弊、國際聯盟之取消、其原因故不自今日始也、蓋氏繼論墨希雙邊恊定之政策加以讚揚、指陳國與國間之和平、不能徒託空言信義、必須根據具體事實、以問題作對象、不僅以願望為滿足、且各公式施於世界各國、以一紙簽訂而忽略各國自身之利益、故雙邊恊定實為維持和平之有効方法、雖雙邊恊定不能謀得世界和平、但蓋氏認為世界和平、固極難望實現云、（十一日海通電）</p>
<h3>法西斯國三角結合</h3>
<p>［柏林］消息靈通人士頃宣稱、德政府將於今晚發表宣言、就意政府决定退出國聯會一事、說明德國對於意國之完全連帶一致云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［柏林］“愛森國民日報”係由希特勒左右手德航空部長戈林將軍所經營、本日論述意大利退出國聯事云、“目下之國際聯盟、除為代表舊世界三大地主英法蘇聯利益之機關外、別無作用”、該報又指明德意日之世界政治三角、為新國家聯合、並稱、“意大利退出國聯、並非重大之要素、惟其加於世界政治三角之重要意義、將明示世界之主人翁堅持一已之財產、而否認其他各國重要利權之時代、已漸趨來途矣”、該報末稱、國社黨之德國對於意方之步驟、衷心贊助、德國深信現時已有一種新和平組織、漸由防共公約而滋生、取國聯之地位而代之云、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>各國觀感</h3>
<p>倫敦</p>
<p>關於意政府决定退出國聯會之一事、此間消息靈通人士、雖並不表示驚異、但以為此舉意義、極關重要、則以意國此項决定、將使集體安全之時期完全吿終、而代之以勢力均衡之新方法也、消息靈通人士又以為意國政府此項决定、可作兩種解釋、一卽義國凖備重返國聯會、但以國聯會承認意國佔領阿比西尼亞·國聯會盟約與凡爾賽條約分離、及完全刪除盟約第十六條三項規定為交換條件、二卽意國完全與國聯會决裂是也，此在張伯倫首相及艾登外相接近人士則以為第二種解釋、最為近似、總之、此後意國外交將採取新政策、而與英法絕緣、正與大戰前自一八七○年至一九一四年間之義國政策如出一轍云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎</p>
<p>關于意大利退出國聯一事、右派時代報頃加以評論云、“意相墨索里尼此其所為、乃將世界各國劃分為兩大集團、用意所在、乃欲促使懦弱之國退出國聯會、并威脅英法兩國俾其接受談判、而將國聯盟約所載制裁條款予以刪除、然後乃由德意兩國重返國聯會、此在自由主義各國苟欲維持其勢力于不墜、務須充實國力、團結一致而後可”、“社會黨人民報”載稱、“墨索里尼對內為極絕望的經濟情形所迫、對外則以為德意日三國力量强大可恃、爰乃一意孤行、冀以造成一種不可挽回之局勢”云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華沙</p>
<p>關於意大利退出國聯會一舉、此間人士並不視為驚異、以為意國對於國聯會之政策、自阿比西尼亞戰事發生以來、並未有所變更、此在政界人士則謂、意國此舉、不致影響意波兩國關係、至波蘭對於國聯會仍當予以擁護、業於法波兩國最近談話時、由波外長柏克上校向法外長台爾博斯加以聲明、自不致為意國此舉所左右云（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓</p>
<p>關於意大利退出國聯一事、美國方面並不以為異、官塲人士因美國非會員國、而不加以評論、美外交界人士則謂、意大利不與國聯會積極合作、由來已久、退盟之後、實亦無多出入、明星晚報載稱、“意國已與德日兩國完全一致、而與英法兩國相睽離、此乃法西斯主義各獨裁國崇尚武力政策、敝　集體安全之一種新警吿、亦卽一種挑置暴動、愛好和平各民族、共知所以自處”云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>日內瓦</p>
<p>關於意大利退出國聯一舉、該國首相墨索里尼自最近兩年以來、發出此項表示已非一次、此與一九三三年日本因滿洲事件宣吿退盟、曁同年十月十四日德國因軍縮問題突然退盟之情形、並不相同、因而國聯會人士聞訉之餘、並不為之驚異、並謂意相不滿於國聯會之處、久為世人所共曉、此次退盟之後、對於該國與國聯會現行關係、實際上並不有以變更之、特國聯各機關所屬意國籍職員、則勢必自行辭職耳、此外按之國聯盟約規定、意國須待兩年之後、始可解除盟約所規定之各項義務、而此項義務、實際上亦僅有續付國聯會會費兩年、計三百六十萬金佛郎一端而已、但在兩年期內、國聯大會與行政院開會時、意大利代表座位仍當予以保留、俾該國若果中途變計、一如西班牙墨西哥兩國前此所為、仍可重返國聯會、至意國退盟之後、是否尚有他國步其後塵一層、此間各觀察家咸以為此種情事、不致發生、緣奧匈兩國在去年雖或願隨意國之後退出國聯會、但今年情形已屬不同、則以各該國與英法兩國關係、自最近數月以來、確已日見改善故也、總之、意國乃國聯會發起國之一、此次退盟雖不足異、但究為國聯會之一大挫折、所望國際和平、不致因而受有影響耳、（十一日哈瓦死斯電）</p>
<p>西班牙</p>
<p>西國共和政府國防部長普利愛脫、頃向哈瓦斯社訪員發表談話稱、“意國决定退出國聯、適在西國民軍凖備對政府軍大舉進攻之前夕、此其意義殊堪重視、墨索里尼之用意、無非欲使意國獲得自由行動、俾最近將來、意國軍隊在西班牙內戰中佔重要地位之際、得以一意孤行、而以吾國為未來大戰中之軍事根據地、藉以逞其帝國主義之冒險志願焉云、（十二日哈瓦斯電</p>
<p>奧大利</p>
<p>政界人士頃宣稱、意國决定退出國聯會之後、奧國在意奧匈三國羅馬議定書中之地位、及奧國對於國聯會之信仰、均不因之而變更、半官機關之維也納日報稱、意首相墨索里尼恰於此際决定退出國聯會、其確實原因安在、無人知之、惟一綫希望現狀未絕、則以墨索里尼宣言中、仍主張廣續歐洲合作政策故也、”“聯邦郵報”承認意國此項决定、極可諒解、“但深恐國聯會從此瓦解、則將成為人類之一大損失”云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>匈牙利</p>
<p>關於意大利退出國聯會一舉、此間半官界人士頃表示歡迎、以為國聯會對於意國實缺乏好意與諒解、惟望意國此舉、對於各民治國不致發生不良影響、而英意兩國關係仍得加以改善、至國聯會各會員國若果希望國聯會之復興、則必須修正國聯會盟約而後可云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>台維斯返國談比京會議</h3>
<p>［紐約］九國公約會議美國首席代表台維斯一行、頃搭乘“華盛頓”號郵船、自歐洲返抵此間、台氏當向各報記者發表談話稱、“九國公約會議主要目的雖未達到、但已獲有若干種結果、而中日兩國眞正意願所在業已了解、卽其一端、質言之、會議雖未克恢復遠東和平、但此非結束工作之謂、反之、凡經會議提及之各項問題、關係各國當賡續加以討論、冀有以解决之、因此各關係國現當利用休會期間交換意見、俾得依熙九國公約所載各項原則、而為中日爭端覓求和平解决之新方式、至關於處理國際關係所當遵循之各項主要原則、九國公約會議亦已重言加以申明、今後自必有受人尊重之一日也”云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>中日戰爭影響國際糖業</h3>
<p>［倫敦］據此間專家宣稱、國際糖業恊定因中日衝突、大受影響、據稱中國包括“滿洲國”及香港在內、為世界最大糖業輸入國、每年達五十六萬噸、此間深懼如日本在華勢力日益加大、則國際糖業加泰爾之分配政策將受阻碍、一切出產限額及输出計劃、將有被傾覆之危險、因此一般對於一九三八年一月在倫敦舉行之國際糖業會議企望至股云、（十一日海通電）</p>

<h3>英議員要求政府增强艦隊實力</h3>
<p>維護英國在遠東利益　美海空軍明春在太平洋大操</p>
<p>［倫敦］反對派工黨下議員弗萊謙中校、曾於一九一八年至一九二一年間供職海軍參謀部、茲擬於下星期內在下議院提出質問案、要求政府立卽派遣軍艦、增强駐華英國艦隊之實力、頃并向報界發表談話稱、“時至今日、吾人在遠東方面所處整個地位、業已發生問題、亞洲各國正注視吾人出以何種行動但吾人覓無一艘主力艦停泊遠東海面、此其為事、實屬不可思議、此際若果派遣軍艦駛往遠東、吾人在該處之地位、卽可有以穏定之、抑此車旣非耀武揚威、亦非對於中日兩國作左右袒、實則目的僅在表示英國在遠東方面所保有之資產與航業利益、必須受人尊重、且英國亦不願被人擴諸中國之外、如此而已”云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>列山隨筆</h3>
<p>— 馮列山</p>
<p>一段萊茵河的故事</p>
<p>普通德國人把萊茵河呌做“父親萊茵河”，好像有過一位中國作家把萊茵河叫做“女兒萊茵河”。為什麼會由父親變成了女兒，問過許多德國人，大家都覺得莫名其妙。</p>
<p>到過萊茵河流域的人，只要他肯多花一些時間，總有樓會發見幾個德人同黑人的混血兒。這批混血兒的數目，據說有幾千人。由於德國人的解釋，那是歐戰後法軍佔領萊茵河一帶的成績。他們的爸爸，就是法國駐軍中的非洲土人。</p>
<p>法軍的佔據萊茵河區域此刻已成為歷史上的陳跡。但一看到這批混血兒，德國人總要回想起這幕悲劇。自然，這又是國社黨人一宗宣傳種族問題的絕好材料。</p>
<p>原來歐戰一停，德軍開始由法境撤退後，法軍卽追踪而至，佔據了萊茵河區域。四年的長期戰爭使本來是世仇的德法兩民族至此更加互相仇恨。</p>
<p>德國人民對於法國兵士壓迫行動的答復，是一種消極的抵抗。為的沒有本國軍隊的保護，他們也知道自己已經等於亡國的人民。鐵路，鑛山以及各工廠的工人都自動起來把全部機器毀掉，然後各人逃開。他們了解，像這種資產是不能够完整地讓敵人佔有的。</p>
<p>法軍到後，據說，到處找不到德國的鐵路工人，只好臨時由法國招了一批工人來德。但這批法國司機工人並不明瞭德國鐵路的路軌設備。在初期，他們就鬧了許多次的火車出事，受了很大的損失。就是一部分鑛山也因爲修理的工程過大，雖被法國人佔領了終於還是無法開</p>
<p>當時法國駐軍與德國人民的感情，怎樣一種惡劣的程度我們可以想像得到。記者有一位德國熟人，他是歐戰時德軍的中級軍官。因為他是在萊茵河地方生長的，所以沒有隨軍東退。他有一天在街道上碰到一個喝醉了酒的法國兵士，受不了侮辱他就開始抵抗。這位法國兵士的步槍也被他搶奪過來。當時他還是三十幾歲的中年人，自己也因為氣憤不過，决心預備犧牲。就在這時候來了幾位隣居，起初他們的勸吿還是不發生効力，後來中間有一位說：“密勒！你得替自己的家庭着想，同時也得替德國着想，何必作這種無益的犧牲！忍住一時的氣吧！”</p>
<p>密勒聽了這句話以後走開了。後來他在德國再與運動中担任了一種很重要的工作·前年德軍進駐萊茵河區域的時候，他對記者說：“你瞧，我老早就知道會有這麼的一天！</p>
<h3>老記者談不合作主義</h3>
<p>一位德國老記者某君，他不但是萊茵河人，同時還在萊茵河一帶做了四十年左右的新聞記者。閒談的時候，我們大家給他起了一個綽號：“百科全書”。他的記性特别好，尤其對於歷史上的掌故。</p>
<p>據他口述，歐戰結束後他由前線歸來重新又作新聞記者，但萊茵河已不是昔日的萊茵河。法國駐軍不但接收了德國政府機關，甚至於一部分私人的事業。滿街上都是法國兵士，夜間八九時以後，幾乎路上就没有行人。法駐軍當局所特别注意的，就是參戰的人物。稍有反抗，坐牢或者失踪也是一種常見的現像。</p>
<p>這時候，德國人民已經没有言論自由，特别是談到法國問題。歷來在德國民間最流行的一首戰歌：“勝利呵，我們要打敗法國！”自然也不准再唱。可是萊茵河一帶的德國人却把這首歌改成：“勝利呵，我們不准説出！”唱時大家更加起勁。法國人聽了也無可奈何！</p>
<p>當時最苦的一種人物，大約還是新聞記者。雖説法國究竟是一個文明國度，不幹壓迫報館關門的勾當，萊茵河各報依舊能够繼續出版；但報紙上的言論已大受打擊，做新聞記者的人每每感到良心與環境衝突，要説他們不願意説的話。像這位老記者那麽達觀的人，據説有一個時期也想到遠是要不要自殺。</p>
<p>法國人的“統治”方法，自然是十分聰明。他們不去摧殘原有的報紙，只創辦一二家機關報。從前拿破侖就是屢次運用過這種手段。“不過，”這位老記者説：“我們所以能够盡量忍受的緣故，一面爲德國的未來着想，一面也因爲法國人還没有設立一種直接壓迫輿論的機關。在表面上，我們同世界各國的報紙享着同樣的言論自由，實際上法國駐軍發下來的消息都非列登不可。好在這一點讀者是明白的。他們每每在字裏行間看懂我們的原意。要經過這種生活十年，説來眞是一件不容易的事情。……此刻一切都過去了。”</p>
<p>據他説，法國人當時曾運用種種方法，例如設立“萊茵河共和國”一事，目的就在於分化德國，使德國永遠没有翻身的機會，後來這一切計劃全部宣告失敗，因爲德國人民决心忍辱一時，抱定不合作的宗旨。以冷靜的態度，答復法國人的威脅利誘。</p>
<p>“否則，”這位老記者説：“我們不是也有變成法國殖民地的可能！”</p>

<h3>“大道市府”僅警察局成立</h3>
<p>財交社三局無法進行　浦東各鄉鎮依舊混沌</p>
<p>浦東在名義上已開放三日、惟各地情形、未見若何進步、記者昨日渡浦調查一般狀况、關於所謂大道市府、僅成立警察一局、局址設在浦東醫院內、暫分總務·行政·司法·三科、總務科長為謝楷、司法科長為傳鏞壽、均北方人、並設偵緝隊於陳氏小學內、隊長亦為北方人吳某、前傳張鏞充任說、並非事實、惟張係任浦東偵緝分隊長、至直屬分局、僅有</p>
<p>浦東分局一所、另在楊家渡與洋涇設分駐所兩處、楊家渡委一吳綬卿為巡官、洋涇委一李令聞為巡官、各率長警二十餘名、維持秩序、塘橋楊思橋等處、均未分設警所、惟高橋鎮已在進行、先設一分駐所、尚未實行、至於南市·閘北·各區分局、均在計劃之中、外傳人選已內定說不確、屬於市府之財政·交通·社會·三局、因舊職員報到甚少、一時</p>
<p>無法進行、局長因無專門人材、亦尚未發表、至關於各市鎮之近况、最南之楊思橋、有張尚義者組織維持會、鄉民一部份照常居住、並未遷走、依次往北、南碼頭塘橋二處、仍由十餘名日兵駐防、居民甚少、情景異常冷落、老白渡·楊家渡兩處、有本地人黃寶康組織維持會、並有</p>

<p>詳細盤查</p>
<p>始予放行、再北至陸家宅鎮、昔年繁盛市街、大半巳燬於火、該處且在日軍警戒綫內、空無一人、沿浦朝東、則其昌棧鎮並無警察、人烟全落、亦無何種組織、如一死鎮、洋涇鎮有本地人顧金生組織維持會、並有警察二十餘名、恊同維持、故有十餘家小飯店應時而生、以供浦邊外商各廠棧之小工就食、肉荘亦有三四家開市、惟鎮上房屋屬於東市者、曾被</p>
<p>炸彈炸毀</p>
<p>十分之七、而市炸毀十分之五、到處呈露戰後慘狀、再東為高廟與東溝兩鎮、向無日兵駐紥、現半數居民照常居住、各小店亦半開排門應市、惟竊盜之事、仍時有發生、高橋鎮當輪渡開航時、居民一部份已遷回、鎮上商店、紛紛開市、頗有回復熱鬧氣象惟輪渡現已被阻停航、市面又逐漸冷落、浦東分局曾擬在該鎮設一分駐所、尚未實行、故地方秩序、由商農兩界自行維持、</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Bloody Battle Unfolds in the Capital</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Acknowledges Taking Nanjing is Truly Not Easy. Foreign Dispatches Say Zhonghua Gate Has Been Breached. Other Japanese Troops Attacking the City Retreat Under Pressure.</p>
<p>According to news from foreigners in this city, yesterday's fighting in the capital was fiercer than ever before. There are reports that Zhonghua Gate has been breached by the Japanese army, but this is difficult to confirm. As for the Japanese troops attacking other gates, they have retreated slightly due to the strong resistance from our army.</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to a correspondent for the Asahi Shimbun, last night Chinese and Japanese troops fought a bloody battle all night long for the southeastern city walls of Nanjing. The intensity of the situation was unprecedented in history. Under the fierce resistance of the Chinese army, the Japanese army tried to expand its foothold of 100 meters within the southeastern gate and occupied the strong position of the Chinese army near the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Zijin Mountain. Judging from the news published in various newspapers, which did not mention the progress of the war, the intensity of the battle can be glimpsed. According to a Japanese news agency correspondent accompanying the Japanese army in the battle at the southeastern gate of Nanjing, at 9:00 a.m. this morning, several squadrons of Japanese aircraft densely bombed the city walls, gates, and Chinese army positions within the city for more than an hour, in order to break through the Chinese army's defenses. At the same time, Tokyo and other cities held celebrations for the Japanese army's entry into Nanjing. (Reuters, December 12)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to news received by various newspapers, the great battle at the gates of Nanjing continued all day long. The Japanese army used bombers, artillery, and even anti-aircraft guns in an attempt to break through the southeastern city walls. Outside the walls, the Japanese army, under the cover of heavy artillery fire from high ground, has occupied Zhonghua Gate, but the Japanese army elsewhere has retreated slightly in order to facilitate the bombing by their artillery and aircraft. Tokyo and Nagoya held lantern parades to celebrate the victory. (Reuters, December 12)</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that yesterday (November 11), the director of the Japanese military intelligence office told a correspondent of the Japanese newspaper that taking Nanjing is truly not easy. Although the Japanese army has occupied one corner of the city, it cannot be said that it has occupied Nanjing. It should be known that Nanjing is five miles long from north to south and three miles long from west to east. Every inch of land is firmly defended, surrounded by strong walls 15 meters high and 10 meters deep, and outside the walls there are moats 20 meters wide and 10 meters deep. The lakes are also natural obstacles to the Japanese army's advance. Therefore, taking Nanjing is truly not an easy task.</p>
<h3>Our Troops Defend Nanjing to the Death</h3>
<p>[Hankou] Although the Japanese army has launched fierce attacks on the gates of Nanjing in the past 48 hours with the help of aircraft, artillery, and tanks, because the Chinese troops defending the city are determined to die and resist bravely, they have not succeeded so far. As of midnight on the 11th, the city and suburbs of Nanjing were still held by the Chinese army. According to news received from foreigners, in the afternoon of the 11th, the Japanese army's attack on the city walls became more intense, and the Japanese aircraft bombing was also fierce. More than 500 shells and bombs fell on the city and suburbs, causing flames to soar into the sky in the city. Although the Chinese army was under fierce attack from the air and land, they still fought to the death, advancing without retreating. Their loyalty, bravery, and sacrifice are admirable. According to a Chinese government spokesman on the evening of the 11th, the Chinese troops defending Nanjing will fight to the last man. The rumors that the Chinese army has abandoned Nanjing are absolutely untrue. As of the evening of the 11th, Nanjing was still firmly held by the Chinese army. The Chinese army has built solid fortifications in various strongholds, preparing to engage in fierce street fighting with the Japanese army when they break through the city walls and enter the city. In short, if the Japanese army wants to occupy Nanjing, it must pay a heavy price. (Express News Agency, December 12)</p>
<p>Zijin Mountain in Nanjing was occupied by the Japanese army. On the 11th, Wang Zhenhuai, the commander of the division under Tan Zixin of the cavalry army, led his troops to attack from the rear, killing and wounding more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers. Wang was also slightly injured by a bullet in his left shoulder. (Huadong News Agency)</p>
<h3>Foreigners Value Strong Resistance</h3>
<p>[Paris] Regarding the war between China and Japan, the radical socialist "République" recently published an article stating, "Tokyo has been waiting for the news of the fall of Nanjing for three days now. The suburbs of Nanjing are still the scene of bloody battles. This shows that the Japanese army has encountered unexpected resistance. Since the Chinese authorities have refused to negotiate peace, it is difficult to predict how the future situation will develop. However, the Japanese economic situation does not allow the war to be prolonged, and the military and civilian factions in that country are not in harmony. Therefore, the Chinese army's defense of Nanjing is worthy of attention, and we must pay close attention to it." (Havas, December 12)</p>
<p>[Washington] Military experts here say that if General Chiang Kai-shek can withdraw the main force of his army to the interior before the Japanese army surrounds Nanjing, then even if communication with the coastal area is cut off and there is a lack of equipment such as arsenals, the strength will still exist and he will be able to continue the long-term war of resistance. Conversely, if the main part of General Chiang Kai-shek's 200,000 troops in Nanjing is not withdrawn in advance and is surrounded by the Japanese army, then the fall of Nanjing will cause a great blow to the Chinese side. Whether it can continue the long-term war of resistance thereafter will become a major question. (Note: The main force of the Chinese army has now withdrawn to the interior, and only a small part of it is left to defend Nanjing. Even if there is resistance, it is only to demand a price from the Japanese army for taking the city. Only in this way is China's long-term war of resistance not a problem.) (Guomin News Agency, December 12)</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun Delivers Important Speech in Hankou</h3>
<p>The Government is Determined to Continue the War of Resistance; All Measures Have Been Prepared.</p>
<p>[Hankou] Zhang Qun, the former Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs and current Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, met with representatives of the Haitian News Agency here last night and delivered an important speech, declaring, "The Chinese government is determined to continue the war of resistance, and will not waver even if Nanjing falls." Zhang stressed that since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese war, the Chinese government has deeply known that the war will be long-term and has made all necessary preparations to be able to deal with Japan for several years. China currently has no worries about a lack of manpower, nor does it have concerns about financial shortages. All casualties will be immediately replenished by the reserve army that has been trained in recent months. When the Haitian News Agency representative asked the authorities about the Chinese government's prepared steps if Nanjing falls, Zhang replied that the plans for all the final measures have been prepared, but what he can tell is that the Chinese government hopes that the Japanese army will advance towards Nanchang, penetrate into the southwest, and move north along the Jinpu Railway, where they will encounter strong resistance from a well-organized Chinese army. Zhang continued, the Chinese government expects that after the Japanese army occupies Nanjing, it will form a "puppet government" and use public opinion as a pretext, but even if the Japanese army forcibly organizes its establishment, the people of China will jointly denounce this "puppet organization" by all means. Zhang admitted that the duration of the Sino-Japanese war is still difficult to predict at this time, but if China is forced to do so, it will definitely be able to sustain the war for several years. This determination to resist for a long time is the possibility of Japan's failure. The Haitian representative then asked whether the Chinese people will be armed to engage in guerrilla warfare. Zhang replied, "This is what the commander of the Eighth Route Army recently proposed. The Chinese government is deeply aware of the dangers of implementing this plan, so even if it implements 'arming the people,' it must do so with strict restrictions." Finally, Zhang expressed his hope that the powers should unanimously support China's war for justice and pure resistance. (Guomin Haitian News Agency, December 12)</p>
<h3>Passengers on the Hoover are Safe</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] This afternoon, the manager of the Dollar Company here received news that the President Hoover is currently endangered by a northeastern storm, but all passengers are safe and sound. Only a few sailors are left on the ship. This morning, the manager tried to communicate with the ship by radio without success. At that time, it was feared that the ship's radio had ceased to function, or that all the people left on the ship had disembarked. (Reuters, December 12)</p>
<p>[Hong Kong] Wilson, the manager of the Dollar Company here, tried to communicate by radio with the President Hoover, which ran aground off an island in Taiwan, this morning, but ultimately failed. This shows that the President Hoover's radio communication has been damaged, or the ship has been abandoned. A Japanese salvage ship will carry Wilson and immediately set off for the scene of the accident. In addition, another Japanese salvage ship will also sail from Japan to the island.

<p>⊙ Xinxiang According to news received here today from Chinese sources, all battle lines in North China are currently quiet. The Japanese are currently engaged in the organization of administrative organs in the areas they have already occupied and are dealing with the frequent attacks by the Eighth Route Army and Sun Dianying's guerrilla forces. The Japanese army in southern Shanxi has withdrawn to eastern and northern Shanxi in order to protect the three railways: Ping-Sui, Ping-Han, and Zheng-Tai. The Eighth Route Army has a total of 50,000 to 60,000 people, scattered in the Taihang Mountains on the border of Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi provinces and near Niangziguan and Pingxingguan. Sun Dianying's force has a total of 15,000 people, distributed on both the north and south banks of the Hutuo River and in the areas of Xingtang, Lingshou, Shijiazhuang, and Shunde. These guerrillas hide during the day and attack at night, making the Japanese army exhausted. The only activity of the Japanese army on the North China front is limited to aircraft, as Japanese planes bomb Chinese army positions every day. (Reuters, December 12)</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Penetrating Deeper into the Interior Face Increasing Operational Difficulties</h3>
<p>Napoleon's Past Can Serve as a Warning; Ishii Explains Japan's Policy Towards China; British Newspaper Believes Chinese Nationalism Will Prevail and Ultimately Overcome this Unprecedented Military Catastrophe.</p>
<p>[London] Japanese Goodwill Envoy Ishii, when meeting with a reporter from the "Sunday Times" today, briefly outlined Japan's objectives in China, including its attitude towards Chiang Kai-shek and the interests of the powers. He said that the Japanese army in China does not want to occupy land or islands such as Hainan Island. If the powers continue to maintain strict neutrality, Japan intends to continue to respect the rights and interests of the powers in China. These are the two main points of Japanese policy. Ishii continued that he believes that after the fall of Nanjing, the Japanese army will not pursue Chiang Kai-shek deep into the Chinese interior. If the Japanese army did this, it would be in danger of repeating Napoleon's mistake in Moscow. However, before Japan negotiates peace with Chiang Kai-shek, the Japanese army must occupy Nanjing. As for the administration of various parts of China, if local officials are willing to cooperate with Japan, they will still be managed by them. However, if Chiang Kai-shek refuses to negotiate peace with Japan, the Japanese army will be stationed in the areas they have acquired for a long time and will levy taxes on the local area to replenish military supplies. He dared to assert that General Chiang Kai-shek, even if not for personal interests, but for the interests of China, will soon be forced to sue for peace. General Chiang Kai-shek now has a very close relationship with the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union can only help him from the sky. It takes months for Soviet military supplies to be transported to Chongqing. Since Chiang has no military supplies and lacks military expenses, he will have no choice but to stop the war in time. However, Chiang may advocate for Chinese communism, but he does not want to refer to Chiang himself as a communist. Ishii then mentioned the Soviet Union, saying that the Japanese military authorities are most concerned about the Soviet Union, but he believes that the Soviet Union is currently experiencing internal strife and cannot wield a strong hand in the Far East. The reporter asked about foreign rights and interests in China. Ishii replied that the use of customs duties to repay foreign debts and the land regulations on which the Shanghai Municipal Council's power is based will still be respected by Japan. The whole of China is currently hostile to Japan, and Chinese merchants dare not trade with the Japanese, but he believes that trade will be restored after peace is established. He believes that China may change its attitude towards Japan in the future. Japan's only goal is to create a friendly China, which refers to the whole of China. Ishii finally said that because Japan has not declared war on China, it has not demanded the rights of belligerents. Therefore, it has no legal basis to ask the powers not to sell military supplies to China, but it has notified France that if it continues to transport military supplies to China via Vietnam, Japanese aircraft may be forced to bomb the French railways from Hanoi through the border and north to Yunnan and east to Nanning. (Reuters, December 12)</p>
<p>[London] The diplomatic correspondent of the "Sunday Times" stated that there is no doubt that Ishii's remarks must be fully approved by the Japanese government. Ishii's mission to London this time is obviously difficult, because the shooting of Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, the British Ambassador to China, the killing of British soldiers by evil people, the bombing of British ships engaged in peaceful commerce, and the destruction of British property on land are all recent events that the British people have not forgotten. China's opportunity to maintain its independence should be discussed in terms of foresight and not in terms of shortsightedness. The general public still believes that Chinese nationalism will ultimately triumph over this military catastrophe. Ishii's reiteration of Japan's guarantee to respect foreign rights is generally welcomed, but the taste of food can only be believed after it reaches the mouth. It is useless to boast about its beauty. Japan certainly does not want to occupy Chinese territory, but Japan wants to imitate the precedent of "Manchukuo" and create a puppet government in the same way. However, even this move is not easy. After the war, all donations and taxes will inevitably increase, which will lead to rising prices and the decline of commerce. The people will be unable to bear this burden. Ishii used the phrase "strict neutrality" in his speech. If Japan were to build puppet governments in Tianjin, Shanghai, and Nanjing, would Britain's refusal to recognize them be seen by Japan as a threat to strict neutrality? If Britain encounters a situation where Governor Chiang is still in control of Guangdong Province and the southern provinces, will it recognize the changes in China after this? This question will involve important events. The correspondent concluded by saying that if Britain remains in the League of Nations, the recognition of land changes must be done within the League of Nations mechanism. Therefore, future disputes are just beginning. (Reuters, December 12)</p>
<h3>The United States will Adopt a "Big Stick" Policy in Dealing with the Far East Situation</h3>
<p>Relying on the Navy as a Backing for Diplomacy; Seeking to Respect International Treaties</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt's administration is about to adopt a "big stick" policy externally, and the signs of this are already emerging. State Department officials now mostly rely on the navy, which is hoping to see its strength grow day by day, as a strong support for their diplomatic policy. As a result of their recent exchange of views with the Navy and the Army, they firmly believe that the United States' foreign policy, especially its policy towards the Far East, will soon become tougher. The personnel of the three departments believe that the United States has fully demonstrated its compliance with and respect for treaties. The step that should be taken in the future is to ask other countries to fulfill their treaty obligations, while using force to support this policy. However, Secretary of State Hull believes that the time is not yet ripe, so he should be patient for a while. However, the benefits of peace and the scourge of war should continue to be explained to the world. (Guomin, November 11)</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Fortress Falls: A Page of Heroic War History on the Eastern Battlefield</h3>
<p>The Jiangyin Fortress, the first major gateway to the Yangtze River, has fallen. However, due to severed communications and obstructed transportation, the various situations before, during, and after the battle are of general concern. Moreover, the great battle feats there are an important historical fact that cannot be erased. The Jiangyin Association in Shanghai, in order to understand the true situation of Jiangyin, sent 15 staff members to Jiangyin to conduct on-the-ground investigations before and after the battle. They have returned to Shanghai one after another. The reporter has specially compiled the information obtained from the on-site investigations of various individuals to create a systematic report.</p>
<p>Historical Greatness</p>
<p>Jiangyin is now the first national defense fortress. However, in the eyes of heroes and famous generals throughout history, they have not forgotten or neglected this ancient city. Countless heroes have shed their blood there, and countless brave soldiers have been buried there. Especially at the end of the Ming Dynasty and the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, the national hero Yan Haiyuan led thousands of Jiangyin children to swear to never surrender to the Manchu invaders. They were besieged in the isolated city and defended it, resisting an army of 200,000 Qing soldiers for more than 80 days. Finally, their food and reinforcements were exhausted. They died heroically and tragically with this ancient city, creating this moving historical fact. Even after more than 200 years, the Chinese people have not forgotten.</p>
<p>Relationship of Geographical Advantage and Natural Barrier</p>
<p>The terrain of Jiangyin is such that it pillows the Yangtze River to the north, has Wushan and Duanshan Mountains as screens to the east, Xiaoshan and Qingshan Mountains as barriers to the west, and relies on Qinwang Mountain and the Da and Xiao Mao Mountains as outposts to the south. One side faces the river, and the other three sides are undulating mountains, hiding Jiangyin deep in the middle of the surrounding mountains. Such a majestic situation deeply benefits from the advantages of geography and natural barriers. The Jiangyin Fortress is built on Huangshan and Junshan Mountains, echoing Jingjiang to the north. The Electrical and Radar School and the airfield are also attached to the fortress area. Moreover, there are three highways, Wu Cheng, Xi Cheng, and Qin Cheng, and other branch lines, making transportation convenient. Commerce and industry are also quite developed. Because of its geographical advantages and natural barriers, it has not only been a place contested by military strategists in the past, but also in modern civil wars, it has never failed to shake hands with this ancient city and have some connection.</p>
<p>Reduced to Rubble</p>
<p>Since the "August 13th" all-out war of resistance began, and after three months of bloody battles in the corner of Shanghai, the battle line on the Eastern Battlefield shifted westward. On the 21st of last month, more than a dozen Japanese planes circled over Jiangyin, dropping bombs for the first time. Afterwards, Japanese planes flew in every day to drop bombs. Initially, residences such as Wu Tinglu's residence, the county government, and the Liyong yarn factory were all destroyed by bombing. Then, a brutal bombing was carried out in the North Gate Street area. Such places as Nanjing College, Gu Jiadai, Shanmen Road, Da Yichun, Xiaoqiao Tou, and major businesses such as Tongshengtai and Rixinheng, were all reduced to rubble, which is deeply regrettable. At that time, the Japanese fleet, concentrated east of Fushan, numbered about 70 or 80 ships. They encircled and attacked Duanshan Mountain, and the rumbling of artillery fire gradually shook Jiangyin. This was the situation from the 20th to the 24th of last month. Japanese troops had already landed at Fushan, and Japanese naval gunfire had already entered the eastern villages of Jiangyin County.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Suffer Heavy Damage</p>
<p>The war invaded the Jiangyin area from Changshu. The situation in Jiangyin became increasingly tense. Large armies gathered throughout Jiangyin. Japanese planes came every day, but they were met with anti-aircraft fire. They only dropped bombs in the high sky. Liu Xing, Commander-in-Chief of the Jiangfang, Xu Kang, Commander of the Jiangfang, and Ouyang Ju, Commander of the Fortress, all personally went to the front to command. The security in the city was the responsibility of the Deputy Commander of Martial Law, County Magistrate Yuan, who led the strong men to take on tasks such as transportation and rescue. The order was orderly and methodical. Nineteen out of ten residents in the city fled to Jiangbei to take refuge. Our Huangshan Fortress soon opened fire to respond, and the loud sound shook both sides of the Yangtze River. At the same time, the mountain artillery emplacements also suddenly opened fire. Many Japanese warships were hit, including two that sank and more than a dozen that were injured. As a result, Japanese warships did not dare to approach within the range of our artillery fire.</p>
<p>Besieged by Land, Sea, and Air</p>
<p>Soon, Wuxi and Changzhou were successively lost. In addition to the intense bombing by the Japanese fleet and the brutal bombing by large Japanese aircraft, the Japanese army also launched a three-pronged invasion by land. The eastern route invaded the Zhouzhuang City and Changsha Mountain area from Changshu. The western route invaded from Wujin (ie Changzhou) via Xiagang, Poushan, and Qingshan. The fighting on this route was the most intense. This area was defended by Guangxi troops, who fought bravely, advancing wave after wave. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Many civilians were injured by stray bullets. However, the Japanese army, relying on its aircraft, artillery, and tanks, launched an all-out invasion. Finally, the two battalions of our Guangxi army, who held the two mountains to the death without retreating, all made heroic sacrifices. The southern route invaded from Wuxi along the Xicheng Highway, via Beizhu and Qingyang, and joined forces with the Japanese army invading from Changshu on the eastern route, and then crossed the Riqiao South Gate, and were surrounded on three sides by the Japanese army, falling into a bitter battle as an isolated army. This was the situation at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Fall</p>
<p>On the 30th of November, artillery shells flew across the city, causing a major fire that spread, with black smoke billowing into the sky and red light illuminating the heavens. From the East Gate to the Ma Pai Lou area, everything was surrounded by thick smoke and raging flames. In addition, the troops of the Northeast Army collapsed without fighting, and the city and suburbs were forced to fall on the 1st of this month. However, our garrison troops in the fortress still relied on the terrain to fire artillery and fought a desperate battle with the Japanese army. After two days and nights of bloody fighting, on the afternoon of the 3rd of this month, the reinforcements were finally cut off, and more than 10,000 isolated troops broke out of the encirclement, retreating to Zhenjiang with tears in their eyes. However, they still left a regiment of men to hold on to the death, and on the 8th of this month, they were still fighting the Japanese army at the Huangshan Fortress, preparing to shed this last drop of blood and demand a heavy price from the Japanese army. On the evening of the 8th, there were still intermittent gunfire and artillery sounds, but by the 9th, it was silent. It is thought that they had heroically sacrificed and died with this fortress. In short, the fall of the Jiangyin Fortress was by no means due to the invasion of the Japanese army's large warships, but due to the encirclement on three sides and the collapse of the internal Northeast Army without fighting. Otherwise, perhaps the Jiangyin Fortress would still be held to the death by our isolated army.</p>
<p>Various Things After the Fall</p>
<p>This time, the retreat of our army from Jiangyin was indeed more planned and orderly than the retreat from Suchang. First, the artillery unit of our army, stationed east of Jiangyin City, was secretly crossed to the other side of the river. Then, the various artillery emplacements and mountain artillery emplacements were destroyed one by one to avoid being transferred to the Japanese army for their use. The blockade line in the river is now being cleared by the Japanese army with small motorboats, but it cannot proceed because it was bombarded by the Bajiu Port artillery emplacement on the opposite side of the river. On the night of the 9th, the Japanese army crossed the river and invaded Jingjiang on the opposite bank, and fierce fighting broke out with our army again. According to a certain gentleman from Jiangyin who escaped from Jingjiang on the morning of the 10th of this month, and took the Taikoo Company's Wuhu wheel to Shanghai yesterday to talk about it, Jingjiang was still in the hands of our army on the morning of the 10th. The battle took place in the southeastern suburbs of Jingjiang County. In the Taixing area, we have mobilized a large army to prevent the Japanese army from advancing westward along the Yangtze River. It is feared that the huge ships sunk by our army within the blockade line cannot be completely removed for a while. The gentleman believes that the report in the Shanghai newspapers that the Japanese army has already dismantled it seems to be too early to say.</p>
<h3>Fujian Province Launches Total Mobilization for Overseas Chinese Remittances</h3>
<p>A Total Mobilization Committee for Remittances Has Been Organized: Xiamen Receives 70 Million in Overseas Remittances Annually</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: The Executive Yuan issued an order to Fujian, stating that the overseas Chinese remittance total mobilization movement proposed by Huang Yuanbin, a commissioner of the Military Commission, would be beneficial to consolidating the foreign exchange fund, and instructed the provincial government to investigate and promote it. The provincial government, upon receiving the order, instructed the various counties to comply and organized an Overseas Chinese Remittance Total Mobilization Movement Committee to start promoting it. Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia are mostly from southern Fujian. The annual overseas Chinese remittances back to China, which are transferred to the inland areas of southern Fujian via Xiamen, amounted to more than 60 million yuan in the 24th year of the Republic of China (1935) and reached 70 million yuan in the 25th year of the Republic of China (1936), which is a huge amount. The measures of the Overseas Chinese Remittance Total Mobilization Movement Committee are as follows:</p>
<p>① The authorities of Fujian, Guangdong and other provinces should quickly find ways to persuade people from various counties with more overseas Chinese to establish provincial associations in the province, and the county groups should initiate township and town mayor conferences. The resolutions of the following proposals should be submitted to the township and town mayor conferences for resolution, and overseas Chinese should be advised to remit money home as much as possible, but they must find ways to remit through the Bank of China branch, office, or agent. If remittances are made through foreign banks, the recipients at home must be instructed to entrust the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, provincial and municipal banks, Postal Savings Bureau, or Central Trust Bureau to collect the money. Violators will be dealt with in accordance with the resolutions of the township and town people's congress. ② Advise the overseas Chinese chambers of commerce stationed abroad to make the same resolutions as above. ③ The Bank of China should inform its branches, offices, and agencies to reduce remittance fees or provide a better exchange rate than the market price for receiving overseas Chinese remittances, and to provide advance payments on trust. ④ The Fujian and Guangdong provincial party and government should jointly organize an overseas Chinese remittance total mobilization movement committee to manage the propaganda and incentive measures for the total mobilization of overseas Chinese remittances. A. The general outline of propaganda should be explained in simple terms: ① The significance of this war of resistance; ② The need for war of resistance; ③ The hope for war of resistance; ④ The importance of overseas Chinese remittances in the war of resistance and in the balance of payments; ⑤ Find ways to publicize the news of overseas Chinese remittances, etc. B. Incentive measures: ① Pay attention to the entrusted collection of overseas Chinese remittances, limited to banks such as the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, provincial and municipal banks, and the Postal Savings Bureau and the Central Trust Bureau. ② Pay attention to the speed of delivery and the preferential exchange rate. ③ The provincial, municipal, and county governments should give awards to those who remit more money, or provide exemptions from entrance exams for their children, etc. ④ The township and town autonomy sanctions should preferably be drawn up by the Overseas Chinese Remittance Total Mobilization Movement Association and submitted to the township and town autonomous associations for consideration. If there is a violation of the resolutions of the General Assembly, a fine of up to 5% of the remittance amount will be imposed, and they will not be allowed to receive the sacrificial meat during ancestor worship until they comply with the resolutions.

<h3>Hangzhou and Ningbo are Calm</h3>
<p>Linghu is Peaceful and Has Not Suffered Devastation</p>
<p>Mr. Wu of Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company hired two small boats in Linghu on the morning of the 6th of this month to carry his family. They arrived in Hangzhou that night, and took a boat to Ningbo on the morning of the 7th, and arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. According to him, Linghu is peaceful as usual, and the houses and residents have not suffered devastation. The situation he saw on the way to Hangzhou and Ningbo was also quite calm.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Fuel and Charcoal Industry Association Go to Wenzhou to Purchase Fuel</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war in this city, only a small amount of Hongji white coal and Kailuan coal have been available in the fuel market, and charcoal has been completely blocked. The Charcoal Industry Association believes that charcoal is the most common fuel for the people's lives. After repeated discussions, they have contacted the producing areas to dredge the supply. It is now known that the association's representatives, with the approval of the Zhejiang Provincial Government from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, have gone to Yongjia County and other places in the Wenzhou area to purchase charcoal and transport it to Shanghai for distribution. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai in about 20 days to meet the market demand.</p>
<h3>Nanhui Brews Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>There is a Saying that Tao Xuesheng Has Accepted Conditions</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that the event of the Huajun guerrillas recovering Nanhui County has been recorded in previous newspapers. It is now known that the Japanese side immediately sent Yamada and Nakao Rikimatsu to contact Tao Xuesheng, the leader of the guerrillas, after the incident, and proposed four methods: ① Tao's troops must withdraw within one week; ② The brigade under his command will be reorganized into the police and assigned to serve in various public security bureaus; ③ Tao will be reassigned as the county magistrate of Chuansha or Jinshan; ④ After the reorganization of the troops under his command, they will wait for the orders of the Japanese military. Tao must also be responsible for recruiting the guerrillas in Qingyang Port, Taihu Lake, and other places. If Tao cannot reach an agreement, it will be resolved by force, and his private property in Shanghai will be confiscated. It is now heard that Tao has reached an agreement on this, and his troops have also left Nanhui.</p>
<p>Another report: Since Tao Xuesheng led his troops to withdraw from Nanhui County, yesterday a rice store owner from Chuansha came to Shanghai and said that there were originally no Japanese troops in the territory of Nanhui, Chuansha, and Fengxian counties. Residents farmed and traded as usual. Since Tao raised the banner to recover Nanhui County, the Japanese have been constantly scouting and dropping bombs. At present, the Japanese have not sent troops to be stationed in the county towns.</p>

<h3>Mussolini Announces Italy's Withdrawal from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Possesses a Powerful Military Force on Land, Sea, and Air, Capable of Competing with Democratic Groups</p>
<p>[Rome] Last night, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini appeared on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia. Amidst the shouts of 100,000 people, he announced Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. He said: "We are now leaving a dilapidated temple that does not work for peace but plans for war. We are moving forward without regret. I am making this important announcement for history, for Italy, and for our revolution. Once a representative of a country comes into contact with the bad environment of Geneva, the good intentions they hold will be lost. And Geneva is entirely surrounded by insidious and shallow aspects that are unfavorable to Italy. Under these circumstances, our appearance at the gates of Geneva is no longer bearable. Now is the time for us to make a choice." The Italian Prime Minister then asked: "Should we still be in the League of Nations?" The crowd shouted "No". The Italian Prime Minister asked again: "Should we withdraw from the League of Nations?" The 100,000 people in front of the palace shouted "Yes" again. The Italian Prime Minister continued: "Italy's decision on its attitude has not been subjected to any pressure. The comrades in Berlin and Tokyo who adhere to this axis have already expressed absolute wisdom. This is a fact. Now Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations is an event of the utmost importance in history, arousing the attention of the world, and its consequences are unpredictable. As for Italy's basic policy, we have given clear proof of creating peace in the Adriatic Sea in the past few days." (This refers to the understanding between Italy and Yugoslavia). "Threatening remarks that often occur, or will occur in the future, in the large democratic group cannot move us in the slightest. They cannot take action that is unfavorable to the Italian people, because the Italian people can bear any sacrifice. We have weapons on land, sea, and air, not only numerous but also tested by two victorious battles. What is even higher than everything else is our revolutionary spirit of patriotism, which cannot be destroyed by world force."</p>
<p>After Mussolini's speech, Foreign Minister Ciano immediately sent a telegram to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, which read: "In accordance with the resolution of the Fascist Supreme Administrative Council, I hereby inform you that Italy has withdrawn from the League of Nations as of December 11, 1937." (December 12th Reuters)</p>
<p>[Rome] It is generally believed that after the close relationship between Italy, Japan, and Germany, the opinions of the Fascist countries and Geneva have become increasingly deeper. Although Mussolini still claims to be striving for peace, his foreign policy may undergo a change to link Italy's defense in the Mediterranean Sea with its allies in preparation for future wars with Britain and France. At the same time, Italy and Germany will probably strongly advise the small countries to also abandon the League of Nations and join the anti-communist group, among which Yugoslavia is the most noteworthy.

<p>[Rome] According to authoritative sources today, after withdrawing from the League of Nations, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will formally announce Italy's transformation into an empire. Since the Italian army occupied the capital of Abyssinia, King Emmanuel III has also held the title of Emperor of Abyssinia. In the future, he may be renamed Emperor of Italy. Some parties claim that Italy's desire to become an empire can avoid the difficulty of other countries refusing to recognize the Italian king as the Emperor of Abyssinia. There is also a saying that Mussolini will soon resign from his position as Prime Minister to give way to his son-in-law, Count Ciano. However, this statement is difficult to verify.

<h3>A Glimpse of the Roman Square</h3>
<p>[Rome] Tonight, the Fascist Party Supreme Council is holding a meeting. Hours ago, the streets in the central area of the city, especially near the Palazzo Venezia and the Prime Minister's residence, were already crowded with people. Even though it was raining heavily, they did not disperse. The square in front of the official residence was illuminated by torches, as if it were daytime. The center of the square was guarded by the Fascist Party army, and the major avenues around it were temporarily closed to traffic. All the theaters and cinemas throughout the city were closed at 8 p.m., and the cafes and restaurants were empty. The various scenes were roughly the same as when the establishment of the Italian Empire was announced on May 9 last year. The members of the Fascist Party Supreme Council entered the Palazzo Venezia one after another before the meeting. At that time, there were several military bands in the Piazza Venezia, taking turns playing patriotic songs. At 8:55, Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace used wireless radio to broadcast, ordering the people to be silent, and saying that the Supreme Council had already started the meeting. Five minutes later, Prime Minister Mussolini came to the balcony, and the people shouted "Leader" three times in unison in the heavy rain. The Prime Minister then delivered a speech (the words can be seen in the previous telegram), announcing Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations. (November 11th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Italy Officially Notifies Germany and Japan</h3>

(November 11th Allied Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the government of that country had notified Germany in advance through diplomatic channels. People in political circles here did not find it strange because they believed that Germany's policy on the League of Nations had sufficient reason to be proved by Italy's withdrawal from the alliance. Observers also said that the League of Nations had failed to adapt to the real situation and had failed to understand the potential power held by the German-Italian axis in Europe. Italy's withdrawal from the alliance was expected. It is hoped that other countries will also follow in Italy's footsteps and withdraw from the alliance. (November 11th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Gayda Writes an Article Criticizing the League of Nations</h3>
<p>[Rome] While the Fascist Supreme Council was meeting to decide on the announcement of withdrawal from the League of Nations, Gayda, the chief writer of the Italian News, published a strong editorial entitled "Get Rid of Geneva". Gayda first compared and discussed the weaknesses of Geneva's collective policy with the advantages of Mussolini's and Hitler's bilateral agreements, and then said, "Now is the time to discuss ways to maintain peace, but the League of Nations is only an organization and does not help in practice. Lessons learned from history show that collectivism is fundamentally incompatible with 'peace policy' and cannot coexist without contradiction. If it must be forced, the result will not only fail to be fair, but will also fuel endless wars." Gayda pointed out that the League of Nations has a history of fifteen years. All the weapons of the League of Nations, such as economic sanctions and military sanctions, are only applied to small and weak countries. Not only has it not dared to implement them on large and wealthy powers, but even if they are implemented, they will be ineffective because strong countries are economically completely independent from a military point of view. Therefore, sanctions have been used by strong countries and cannot be used on strong countries. Therefore, it is said to be unfair, and the implementation of the League of Nations Covenant will cause individual countries to be dragged into endless wars due to circuitous relationships, and world peace will never be achieved. Therefore, it is said to fuel wars. Because of these two drawbacks, the cancellation of the League of Nations does not begin today. Gayda then praised Mussolini's policy of bilateral agreements, pointing out that peace between countries cannot be based on empty words and trust, but must be based on concrete facts, with problems as the object, not only with wishes as satisfaction, but also with each formula applied to all countries in the world, with a paper signing that ignores the interests of each country itself. Therefore, bilateral agreements are an effective way to maintain peace. Although bilateral agreements cannot seek world peace, Gayda believes that world peace is extremely difficult to achieve.

<h3>Fascist Triangles Combined</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Well-informed sources recently announced that the German government will issue a declaration tonight, explaining Germany's complete solidarity with Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations. (December 12th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Berlin] The "Essen National Daily", which is run by Hitler's right-hand man, General Goering, the Minister of Aviation, commented on Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations today, saying, "The current League of Nations has no other function except as an institution representing the interests of the three major landlords of the old world, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union." The newspaper also pointed out that the world political triangle of Germany, Italy, and Japan is a new alliance of countries, and said, "Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations is not a major element, but its important significance in the world political triangle will clearly show that the masters of the world insist on their own property, and the era of denying the important rights and interests of other countries is gradually coming to an end." The newspaper concluded that the National Socialist Party of Germany wholeheartedly supports the Italian side's steps. Germany firmly believes that a new peaceful organization is gradually growing out of the anti-communist pact, replacing the position of the League of Nations. (December 12th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>International Reactions</h3>
<p>London</p>
<p>Regarding the Italian government's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, well-informed sources here, while not expressing surprise, consider this move to be of utmost importance. This is because Italy's decision will completely end the era of collective security and replace it with a new approach of the balance of power. Well-informed sources also believe that the Italian government's decision can be interpreted in two ways: first, Italy is prepared to return to the League of Nations, but in exchange for the League of Nations recognizing Italy's occupation of Abyssinia, separating the League of Nations Covenant from the Treaty of Versailles, and completely deleting the three provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant; second, Italy is completely breaking with the League of Nations. Those close to Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Eden believe that the second interpretation is the most likely. In short, Italian diplomacy will adopt a new policy and sever ties with Britain and France, just like the Italian policy before the Great War from 1870 to 1914. (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Paris</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the right-wing newspaper "Le Temps" recently commented: "Mussolini's actions divide the countries of the world into two major blocs. His intention is to induce weak countries to withdraw from the League of Nations and to threaten Britain and France to accept negotiations and delete the sanctions clauses contained in the League of Nations Covenant. Then Germany and Italy will return to the League of Nations. If the liberal countries want to maintain their power, they must strengthen their national strength and unite." The socialist newspaper "Populaire" stated: "Mussolini is forced by an extremely desperate economic situation domestically, and believes that the strength of Germany, Italy, and Japan is reliable externally, so he acts arbitrarily, hoping to create an irreversible situation." (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Warsaw</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, people here do not regard it as surprising, believing that Italy's policy towards the League of Nations has not changed since the Abyssinian War. Political figures said that Italy's move will not affect the relationship between Italy and Poland. As for Poland's support for the League of Nations, Foreign Minister Colonel Beck has already stated this to French Foreign Minister Delbos during recent Franco-Polish talks, and it will not be swayed by Italy's move. (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Washington</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, the United States does not consider it unusual. Officials do not comment because the United States is not a member state. American diplomatic circles say that Italy has long been inactive in cooperating with the League of Nations, and there will be little change after withdrawing from the League. The "Star-Evening News" stated: "Italy has completely aligned itself with Germany and Japan and is estranged from Britain and France. This is a new warning from the fascist dictatorships that advocate military force against collective security, and a provocation, so that all peace-loving nations know how to conduct themselves." (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>Geneva</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, Prime Minister Mussolini has expressed this more than once in the past two years. This is different from the situation in 1933 when Japan announced its withdrawal from the League due to the Manchurian Incident, and Germany's sudden withdrawal from the League on October 14 of the same year due to the disarmament issue. Therefore, League of Nations officials are not surprised to hear the news, and said that Prime Minister Mussolini's dissatisfaction with the League of Nations has long been known to the world. After this withdrawal, there will be no actual change in the country's current relationship with the League of Nations. However, Italian staff members belonging to the League of Nations organs will inevitably resign. In addition, according to the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, Italy must wait two years before it can be released from the various obligations stipulated by the Covenant, and these obligations actually only amount to continuing to pay the League of Nations membership fees for two years, totaling 3.6 million gold francs. However, during the two-year period, the seat of the Italian representative should still be reserved when the League of Nations General Assembly and the Administrative Council meet, so that if the country changes its mind midway, as Spain and Mexico did before, it can still return to the League of Nations. As for whether other countries will follow suit after Italy's withdrawal, observers here generally believe that this will not happen. Although Austria and Hungary may have been willing to follow Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations last year, the situation is different this year, because the relationship between those countries and Britain and France has indeed improved in recent months. In short, Italy is one of the founding countries of the League of Nations. Although this withdrawal is not surprising, it is ultimately a major setback for the League of Nations. It is hoped that international peace will not be affected by it. (Havas dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>Spain</p>
<p>Spanish Republican Government Defense Minister Prieto recently stated in an interview with Havas News Agency: "Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations comes on the eve of the Spanish National Army's preparation for a major offensive against the government forces, which is of great significance. Mussolini's intention is nothing more than to allow Italy to obtain freedom of action, so that in the near future, when Italian troops occupy an important position in the Spanish Civil War, they can act arbitrarily and use our country as a military base in the future Great War, in order to fulfill their imperialist ambitions." (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Austria</p>
<p>Political figures recently declared that after Italy's decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, Austria's position in the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian Roman Protocol, and Austria's faith in the League of Nations, will not change as a result. The semi-official "Vienna Daily" stated that no one knows the real reason why Italian Prime Minister Mussolini decided to withdraw from the League of Nations at this time. However, a glimmer of hope for the status quo has not been extinguished, because Mussolini still advocates continuing the European cooperation policy in his declaration. "The Federal Post" acknowledged that Italy's decision is very understandable, "but it is deeply feared that the collapse of the League of Nations will be a major loss for mankind." (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Hungary</p>
<p>Regarding Italy's withdrawal from the League of Nations, semi-official figures here recently expressed their welcome, believing that the League of Nations lacked goodwill and understanding towards Italy. It is hoped that Italy's move will not have a negative impact on the democratic countries, and that the relationship between Britain and Italy can still be improved. If the member states of the League of Nations hope for the revival of the League of Nations, they must revise the League of Nations Covenant. (Havas dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Davis Returns Home to Discuss Beijing Conference</h3>
<p>[New York] Davis, the chief representative of the United States at the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, and his party recently returned here from Europe aboard the "Washington" mail ship. Davis then made a statement to reporters, saying, "Although the main purpose of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has not been achieved, it has achieved several results, and the true intentions of China and Japan have been understood. In short, although the conference failed to restore peace in the Far East, this does not mean the end of the work. On the contrary, the various issues mentioned at the conference should be discussed by the countries concerned in order to resolve them. Therefore, the countries concerned should now use the recess period to exchange views, so that they can seek new ways to peacefully resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute in accordance with the various principles contained in the Nine-Power Treaty. As for the various major principles that should be followed in dealing with international relations, the Nine-Power Treaty Conference has also reiterated them, and it will surely be respected one day in the future."

<h3>Sino-Japanese War Affects International Sugar Industry</h3>
<p>[London] According to experts here, the international sugar industry agreement has been greatly affected by the Sino-Japanese conflict. It is said that China, including "Manchukuo" and Hong Kong, is the world's largest sugar importer, reaching 560,000 tons annually. There is deep fear here that if Japan's power in China increases, the distribution policy of the International Sugar Cartel will be obstructed, and all production quotas and export plans will be in danger of being overturned. Therefore, there is a great expectation for the International Sugar Conference to be held in London in January 1938. (Haitong dispatch on the 11th)</p>

<h3>British Parliamentarians Demand Government Strengthen Naval Power</h3>
<p>To Protect British Interests in the Far East - US Navy and Air Force to Hold Large-Scale Maneuvers in the Pacific Next Spring</p>
<p>[London] Lieutenant Colonel Flacham, a member of the opposition Labour Party in the Lower House, who served in the Naval Staff from 1918 to 1921, plans to submit a question in the Lower House next week, demanding that the government immediately send warships to strengthen the strength of the British fleet stationed in China. He also told the press that "Today, our entire position in the Far East has become a problem. Asian countries are watching what actions we take, but it is incredible that we cannot find a battleship stationed in the Far East. If we send warships to the Far East at this time, our position there can be stabilized. This is neither a show of force nor a bias towards China and Japan. In fact, the purpose is only to show that the assets and shipping interests that Britain has in the Far East must be respected, and Britain does not want to be expanded beyond China, that's all."

<h3>Soviet Union Holds General Election, Nationwide Enthusiastic Voting</h3>
<p>Stalin Assures the People That He Will Faithfully Fulfill His Promises</p>
<p>[Moscow] The election of the Soviet Federal Council has begun since 6:00 this morning. The country is divided into 243 electoral districts, each district electing one member of parliament. Among the 170,000,000 people in the country, more than 90,000,000 people have the right to vote, of which 2,000,000 are Communist Party members and 5,000,000 are sympathizers with the Communist Party. The election results will be broadcast to the country by radio at any time. (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Stalin, the General Secretary of the Communist Party, delivered a speech to Moscow voters yesterday afternoon, saying briefly that the people of the city have expressed their trust in him, which is deeply appreciated. He therefore bears new responsibilities and will faithfully fulfill them. The mutual cooperation between the agricultural and industrial sectors to participate in the election of the Federal Council is commendable. "According to the election law, the members of the Federal Council are actually servants of the people. If the promises made to the people are not fulfilled, the people can dismiss them." Dimitrov, the Secretary-General of the Third International, also delivered an election speech in the city of Kostroma, saying briefly that the fascists are sparing no effort in instigating war, and the bourgeois democratic countries are condoning it. Fortunately, the fascist spies and saboteurs in Soviet Russia have now disappeared, which is the biggest failure of the fascists. At a time when the war crisis is becoming increasingly urgent, only the Soviet Union is a pillar of peace. "The three fascist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan either attack Austria and Czechoslovakia, or attack Spain, or attack China, but if they fight with the Soviet Union, the risk is great."

<p>[Moscow] At a meeting held at the Bolshoi Theater here today, Stalin delivered his first speech on the Soviet elections, stating, "Our elections are the only truly free and democratic elections in the world." Stalin praised the progress of the election affairs and traced the progress of socialism in the Soviet Union in the past ten years. Stalin also said, "Socialism in our country has not only been established, but has become a part of people's lives. Ten years ago, there were still people discussing whether socialism could be established in our country, but now there are no longer those who discuss it, because it has become a tangible and real-life event." When Stalin stepped onto the stage, the cheers of the crowd lasted for a long time. Stalin then admitted that he had no intention of giving a speech, but was strongly invited to attend the meeting. Stalin is a candidate for the Moscow Supreme Soviet District where the meeting was held. Before Stalin's speech, workers, intellectuals, and housekeepers in the venue all pointed out to the crowd that voting for Stalin was a great honor. There were cheers every time Stalin's name was mentioned in the venue. (Reuters dispatch on the 11th)</p>
<p>[Moscow] Zhdanov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of the Soviet Union, delivered an election speech at the Voters' Congress in the Volodarsky Electoral District of Leningrad on the 9th, saying, "The Bolshevik Party is now allied with party members and non-party workers, peasants, employees, and intellectuals to participate in the Supreme Soviet elections. Our party has strived for the alliance of workers and peasants at all stages of the struggle for the victory of socialism. We have worked hard to consolidate the alliance between party members and workers and peasants, and to unite all urban and rural workers around our party. Now we have finally reached this important period. The alliance between party members and non-party people has become the basis for the election of the highest organ of the Soviet government, the basis for consolidating all socialist construction work, and a certain foundation for improving the material and cultural conditions of all urban and rural workers. This is the happiest day for our party. We need the alliance between party members and the people, the alliance between two million party members and ninety million non-party voters, to pursue the further victory of socialism and to further consolidate our socialist economy and our collective farm agriculture. We need this alliance to free our people from the shackles of exploitation forever, to make our women forever free and equal, and to make our children forever happy and stable. We need this alliance to make all the people of the Soviet Union forever harmonious, forever peaceful, and prosperous, and to give the people the right to work, education, and a free and happy life forever."</p>
<p>"Since the establishment of the Soviet regime, we have done our best to fight for peace. We have defended our motherland and resisted the interventionist troops. Our country has repeatedly been on the verge of war, but it has relied on the government's wise and consistent vision. It has relied on Stalin's ability to see through the enemy's conspiracies to unite various capitalist countries to harm our regime and to use his wisdom to avoid possible attacks on the Soviet Union by all capitalist countries. It is only because of this that we have been able to avoid war for sixteen years and ensure peaceful labor."</p>
<p>"Our main enemies are the reactionary fascist capitalist countries. They are preparing to fight against the Soviet Union. The sentries they sent to our country are the shameless Trotskyite, Bukharinite, spies, terrorists, and secret agents. They use all criminal means to subvert the power of the Soviet Union and harm the workers and peasants, but the Soviet regime has given them a crushing blow and will eventually eliminate them completely. "We have three basic forces that are sufficient to protect us from foreign aggression: first, a great intelligence agency that is loyal to the people, a disciplinary agency; second, a workers' and peasants' Red Army that is loved by the people, has a good organization and modern equipment, and is feared by the enemy; third, a wise and consistent vision of peace. If the fascist reactionary countries dare to test the power of our country, they will find that the Soviet people's struggle power is sufficient to completely crush all the fascist parties."</p>

<h3>Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty Negotiations at a Standstill</h3>
<p>[Tokyo] Since October, Japan and the Soviet Union have been negotiating the revision of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty. So far, the Soviet Union has not given a definite reply. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the 11th to announce the details of the negotiations, and at the same time requested the Soviet side to find a way to deal with it properly. It is said that the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the negotiations on the revision of the Japan-Soviet Fisheries Treaty, Ambassador Shigemitsu continued to urge the Soviet side's negotiating committee member and Far East Minister Kazirovsky, because the Soviet government authorities delayed in submitting their specific plan. Finally, on the evening of December 7, he met with the minister, but the specific plan had not been confirmed by the government as usual. Ambassador Shigemitsu met with Stomonyakov, the acting People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs, on the 8th and reiterated his views. At the same time, he asked when the plan would be submitted. Mr. Shi said that the plan described at the meeting on November 20, even if it is made into a specific plan, must still be based on the opinions of the People's Committee meeting to make a substitute plan. The plan is now being rushed, and after it is confirmed by the meeting, it will be submitted to the Japanese side, but the approximate date is not specified. If the negotiations are delayed in this way, all aspects of the Japanese government and the private sector are extremely dissatisfied. In order to protect their rights and interests, the argument that they should proceed with a decisive determination is now rising. (Domei News Agency dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Arrives in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Received a Warm Welcome</p>
<p>⊙Capital of Yugoslavia On the morning of this day, the French Foreign Minister Delbos arrived here at 9:00 a.m. More than 60,000 people went to the station to welcome him, and the enthusiasm was unprecedented. Prime Minister Stojadinović and most of the cabinet members went to the station to greet him. After the French Foreign Minister took the car into the platform, the infantry band played the national anthems of France and Southern countries.

There were also various groups holding banners waiting outside the station. After Delbos got off the car, he went to the French Embassy. On the way from the station to the French Embassy, a large number of people crowded the road, all holding small flags and shouting slogans. Several thousand university students, led by female students, broke through the police cordon and sang the French Marseillaise (the French national anthem). At the same time, several thousand university students gathered around the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to hold demonstrations. Many people also went to the Czech Embassy in groups. When they met the police on the way, they wanted to suppress them, and a conflict broke out between the two sides. The police opened fire, killing one demonstrator and injuring many others. In addition, demonstrators also clashed with the police in front of the House of Representatives and at the site of the monument to France in the park. The whole city was decorated with the flags of France and Southern countries today. At 10:15 a.m., Delbos visited Prime Minister Stojadinović and talked for a long time.

Air Force Minister Guy La Chambre responded that French bombers and fighter planes could fly at 300 miles per hour, a speed higher than that of British or German aircraft.

<h3>Japanese Warships Occupy Two More Islands in Guangdong</h3>
<p>One is Sanzao Island in Zhongshan County, the Other is Shangchuan Island in Taishan County</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Three or four Japanese warships once raided the port of Guangao, which belongs to Chaoyang County, in mid-November. They used small motorboats to land sailors, but were repelled by our defense forces. On the 25th, two Japanese cruisers and five destroyers came to the Guangao sea area near Cape of Good Hope. Using small motorboats, they carried three or four hundred sailors. First, they intercepted all of our fishing boats in the nearby sea and ordered the fishermen to guide them to invade the land. Fortunately, our defense forces detected this and stood ready, and the sailors retreated. The area from Chaoyang to Shantou is still under martial law. It is said that the Japanese warships plan to use the coast of Chaoyang and Shantou as the right wing, Humen, Chiwan, and Aotou in Huizhou and Lihai as the central route, and the counties of Shantai and Zhongshan as the left wing. As for the Qiongyai and Leizhou Straits, the destinations are Haikou and Beihai, intending to move towards Qiongyai from Haikou and control the two Guangdongs from Beihai. The Japanese have already been active. Their attempt to occupy the Zhizhou Island opposite Beihai is the first step in invading Beihai. As for the central route, their fleet is currently anchored in Tangjia Bay, which belongs to Zhongshan, with about six or seven ships. Aircraft carriers are also stationed there. After Gaolan Island in the sixth district of Zhongshan County was occupied, the local villagers all fled elsewhere. Japanese soldiers are now setting up camps on the island, and various supplies have been completed. The water levels and waterways in the vicinity have also been surveyed, and on the 28th of last month, more than 300 soldiers were sent to attack Sanzao Island in Zhongshan County. At that time, about 400 to 500 able-bodied men on the island intercepted them from the shore. The Japanese side bombed them with aircraft, and our able-bodied men suffered heavy casualties. Finally, they ran out of ammunition and were forcibly landed. The villagers on the island suffered extremely heavy losses of food, property, clothing, and other items. Most of the natives on the island are fishermen. After this battle, they have all gone bankrupt and are exposed to the elements, waiting for disaster. The situation is extremely pitiful. Also, the Japanese warships stationed along the coast of Taishan County dispatched 400 to 500 soldiers on the 28th of last month to attack Shangchuan Island, which belongs to the county, in the early morning, riding fishing boats. There are thousands of villagers on the island who are engaged in agriculture and fishing. The entire island has dikes and dams to prevent floods. The entire island is isolated in the sea, located south of Taishan County and west of Chixi County, between the two counties, with convenient transportation. At that time, two squads of the island's security team resolutely resisted the Japanese soldiers. The Japanese warships then opened fire and bombarded the islanders, and aircraft assisted in the battle in the air. The island's security team was finally overwhelmed, and the Japanese soldiers landed at Qitou Sha on the island. At noon, they moved to the Liyu Pond and Sanzhouxu area in the island and sent technicians to survey the waterways nearby, intending to take Lingxi Island in the vicinity. Therefore, at present, all the small islands along the coast of Guangdong Province will be invaded. (2nd)</p>
<h3>Casual Notes from Lieshan</h3>
<p>— By Feng Lieshan</p>
<p>A Story of the Rhine River</p>
<p>Ordinary Germans call the Rhine River "Father Rhine," as if a Chinese writer called the Rhine River "Daughter Rhine." Why it changed from father to daughter, I have asked many Germans, and everyone finds it inexplicable.</p>
<p>Anyone who has been to the Rhine River region, as long as he is willing to spend some more time, will always find a few mixed-race children of Germans and blacks. The number of these mixed-race children is said to be several thousand. According to German explanations, this is the result of the French army occupying the Rhine River area after the European War. Their fathers were African natives in the French garrison.</p>
<p>The French occupation of the Rhine River region has now become a historical relic. But seeing these mixed-race children, Germans always recall this tragedy. Naturally, this is another excellent material for the National Socialists to promote racial issues.</p>
<p>Originally, as soon as the European War stopped and the German army began to withdraw from French territory, the French army followed closely and occupied the Rhine River region. Four years of protracted war made the German and French nations, which were originally hereditary enemies, hate each other even more.</p>
<p>The German people's response to the oppressive actions of the French soldiers was a kind of passive resistance. Because they did not have the protection of their own country's army, they also knew that they were equal to the people of a fallen country. Railway, mining, and factory workers all spontaneously destroyed all the machinery and then fled. They understood that this kind of asset could not be completely occupied by the enemy.</p>
<p>After the French army arrived, it is said that they could not find German railway workers everywhere and had to temporarily recruit a group of workers from France to Germany. But this group of French drivers and workers did not understand the German railway track equipment. In the early days, they had many train accidents and suffered great losses. Even a part of the mines was unable to be opened even after being occupied by the French because the repair work was too large.</p>
<p>We can imagine the kind of bad relationship between the French garrison and the German people at that time. A German acquaintance of the reporter, who was a mid-level officer in the German army during the European War, did not retreat east with the army because he grew up in the Rhine River area. One day, he met a drunken French soldier on the street, and he could not bear the insult, so he began to resist. He even snatched the French soldier's rifle. At that time, he was still a middle-aged man in his thirties, and he was so angry that he was determined to prepare to sacrifice himself. At this time, a few neighbors came, and at first their persuasion was ineffective. Later, one of them said: "Miller! You have to think about your family, and you also have to think about Germany. Why make such a useless sacrifice! Endure the anger for a while!"</p>
<p>Miller walked away after hearing this sentence. Later, he took on a very important job in the German rearmament movement. When the German army entered the Rhine River region the year before last, he said to the reporter: "You see, I knew there would be such a day a long time ago!"</p>
<h3>An Old Reporter Talks About Non-Cooperation</h3>
<p>A certain German old reporter, not only is he a Rhine River person, but he has also worked as a news reporter in the Rhine River area for about forty years. During a casual conversation, we all gave him the nickname: "Encyclopedia." His memory is particularly good, especially for historical anecdotes.</p>
<p>According to his oral account, after the end of the European War, he returned from the front line and became a news reporter again, but the Rhine River was no longer the Rhine River of the past. The French garrison not only took over the German government agencies, but even part of the private enterprises. The streets were full of French soldiers. After eight or nine o'clock at night, there were almost no pedestrians on the road. The French garrison authorities paid special attention to those who had participated in the war. A slight resistance, imprisonment, or disappearance was also a common phenomenon.</p>
<p>At this time, the German people no longer had freedom of speech, especially when it came to the French problem. The most popular war song among the German people, "Victory, we will defeat France!" was naturally no longer allowed to be sung. But the Germans in the Rhine River area changed this song to: "Victory, we are not allowed to say it!" Everyone sang even more vigorously. The French could do nothing about it!</p>
<p>The most miserable kind of people at that time were probably still news reporters. Although France is ultimately a civilized country and does not engage in oppressive actions to close down newspapers, the Rhine River newspapers can still continue to be published; however, the speech in the newspapers has been greatly suppressed, and people who work as news reporters often feel a conflict between their conscience and the environment, having to say things they do not want to say. Even a person as broad-minded as this old reporter is said to have thought about whether or not to commit suicide for a period of time.</p>
<p>The French "rule" method is naturally very clever. They did not destroy the original newspapers, but only founded one or two official newspapers. Napoleon had repeatedly used this method in the past. "However," this old reporter said, "the reason why we were able to endure as much as possible was because we were thinking about the future of Germany, and also because the French had not yet established an agency that directly suppressed public opinion. On the surface, we enjoyed the same freedom of speech as newspapers in other countries around the world, but in reality, the news released by the French garrison had to be published. Fortunately, the readers understood this. They often understood our original intentions between the lines. It is not easy to go through this kind of life for ten years. … Now everything is over."</p>
<p>According to him, the French used various methods at the time, such as establishing the "Rhine River Republic," the purpose of which was to divide Germany, so that Germany would never have a chance to recover. Later, all these plans were declared a failure, because the German people were determined to endure humiliation for a time and were determined not to cooperate. They responded to the French threats and inducements with a calm attitude.</p>
<p>"Otherwise," the old reporter said, "we might also have become a French colony!"</p>

<h3>News from Hometowns after Various Places Fall</h3>
<p>Large Part of Wuxi City Burned Down Nanxun Suffered Very Heavy Losses — Anji and Xiaofeng Are Still Calm —</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>According to Mr. Zhang, a villager reported yesterday by the Wuxi Native Place Association, he was conscripted by the Japanese army six days ago in Qianqiao Township, Wuxi, as a boatman. The Japanese army transported more than ten soldiers to the city. At Wuxi, he saw Japanese troops at the foot of the city. All our troops had withdrawn. The east-west streets, roads, and the area along the Beitang River, as well as the area from the Dàqiáo to the Old North Gate, were burned down. The Dàjiē inside the North Gate was also destroyed. There are still a small number of residents in the city. Mr. Zhang and two other villagers safely arrived in Shanghai after helping the Japanese army row the boat. Many ships came with them, all parked in the Suzhou River area. When they left, the Japanese army gave them a certificate allowing them to go home. Mr. Li reported that he arrived in Shanghai six days ago and witnessed more than eighty houses being destroyed in Shitangwan. Luoshe was also destroyed. Most of the city was burned down, which was unbearably bleak. The association received reports from several fellow villagers that they went to Jingjiang on the second day, intending to cross the river back to Wuxi, but were stopped and returned to Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to the villagers, after the outbreak of the war, they fled to Tieqiao. They then heard that the Japanese army had occupied Wuxi and the Chinese army had withdrawn. According to villagers, the Japanese army in the city did not make things difficult for the people. They went to the city intending to visit their mother, but were dragged by the Japanese army to Yangyaowan near Dàqiáo and forced to work as boatmen, transporting more than ten Japanese soldiers to Shanghai. It is said that many houses outside the south gate of Wuxi were destroyed due to the resistance war. The losses in the northern countryside were less, because our army withdrew early. Fortunately, the Bank of China outside the North Gate was not destroyed.</p>
<p>Nanxun</p>
<p>On November 28, a special envoy was sent to Xun to investigate the real situation. He returned to Shanghai on the morning of December 10 to report as follows: He set off on November 28 and arrived at Taodun on December 2. He learned that the Japanese army stationed in Nanxun now patrols everywhere during the day, and only moves slightly in Shangtang at night. There are no Japanese troops in Xiatang. Therefore, villagers in the four villages steal, loot, and set fires to empty houses to Nan Sann, resulting in most of the houses in the town being destroyed. On the night of the 3rd, he took a boat to Nanxun to investigate the route, from Sunjiaba Jigucang Zhangwangmiaòqiaot to the east of the river to Fenghuangqiao back to Taodun. He learned that most of the Xun people avoided Yanmu. So, on the 4th, he went to Yanmu and met Xu Pucheng, Zhu Yuanzhi, Liu Minzhi, Jin Yange, Huangfubo Ying, Zhuang Yesheng, Shen Shiqi. From them he learned that since the morning of November 15, rumors spread that Pingwang had opened fire, and people moved away. The 15th was even more panic, and the telephone was also cut off. The organizational staff all fled. On the 16th night, our sappers bombed the bridges. On the 17th night, looking from outside Nan Sann, he saw the fire in the Xun Town illuminating the sky. He knew that the first fire was from the Guandi Temple in Dong Sann to the section of the Dàlù Bank and Majiahui, and heard of a part of the mutiny and contact with the army that opened from Lake to Xun. It stopped on the 18th at noon. In the afternoon, the Japanese army arrived in Xun and burned for more than ten days. The losses in the whole town are about 80-90%. It is known that Dongqian and Mayao are difficult to escape. Ten bandits ran rampant in the countryside and robbed refugees. On the 5th and 6th, he went to various villages to find people but did not meet them. He set off back to Shanghai on the 7th and arrived on the morning of the 10th.</p>
<p>Jintan</p>
<p>According to a report from a fellow villager in Jintan by the Xin Xin News Agency, after Wuxi and Changzhou fell one after another, Tanyi also fell into a war zone. After the middle of last month, the residents in the city moved away to the countryside. The town was bombed twice by Japanese aircraft, dropping a total of thirteen bombs. The extent of the damage is unknown. At present, nine out of ten houses in the city are empty, and the shops have also stopped indefinitely. Except for some of the autumn harvests in the four villages that have already been harvested, the rest have not been harvested as scheduled due to the war, resulting in them falling into the fields and causing heavy losses.</p>
<p>Anji</p>
<p>According to a report from his fellow villager Wu Dongmai, our city's Lake Club recently received a letter from a friend in Anji, saying that Anji, Xiaofeng, Meixi, and other places are very peaceful. Many people have taken refuge there, but there are rumors from time to time, and people are inevitably panic-stricken. According to Shen Xinfu, he recently received a letter from his brother from Qianjin, saying that the place is peaceful, and there are many refugees. The local houses are rented out.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Federation of Relief Societies and Other Organizations Plan Refugee Production Work</h3>
<p>Some are assigned to work in the workhouses to help their livelihoods, and others are introduced to work in various factories. National doctor Xu Wei organized a refugee skills training center</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Committee of the Municipal Federation of Citizens' Associations of the First Special District believes that since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, refugees have gathered in this city. Although various charitable organizations have tried to send them away, there are still more than 3,000 people in various shelters and wandering in the streets. Most of these people come from the war zone, and their families have been destroyed. Even if transportation is restored, it is difficult to send them all away. If this continues, there will only be consumption without production, and the supply will be large, making it difficult to sustain for a long time. The association has organized a refugee production design committee to plan refugee production work. According to the person in charge of the association, the association plans refugee production work with two directions: First, to enable refugees in various shelters to make handicrafts in the shelters to help with their livelihoods; second, to introduce refugees with industrial skills to work in various places. Regarding the first item, such as sewing, embroidery, bag making, and other work can be carried out. The second item, such as civil engineering craftsmen, mechanical craftsmen, and skilled workers from various factories, can be arranged to some extent if ways can be found to introduce them when the factory industry is slightly active. The association is now determined to do its best to carry out this urgent refugee production plan, and plans to first investigate how many refugees in various shelters have industrial skills. At the same time, it will also look at the needs of various factories in order to introduce them separately. However, this matter is important and quite important, and it relies on the joint efforts of all sectors of society to achieve great results.</p>
<p>Establish a Refugee Skills Training Center</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, Shanghai National Doctor Xu Wei has led a wartime service group of the medical community to participate in the Shanghai Red Cross and rushed to rescue people in the rain of bullets, with the greatest enthusiasm. Recently, in view of the increasing number of refugees in the city, eating and consuming is the biggest hidden worry at present, he has specially united famous people in Shanghai to organize a refugee skills training center, using young and strong refugees with production skills to make various daily necessities and handicrafts. A preparatory office has now been set up in Daderi, South Chengdu Road, and is actively preparing, and plans to submit an application to the International Relief Committee for assistance. It is heard that the scope of the skills training is set to be shoe making, hat making, bamboo work, small wooden work, garment making, knitting, velvet rope making, tin utensils, hairdressing, box making, and other crafts. It is also heard that, except for clothing, hairdressing utensils, the rest can use scraps of old clothes and waste such as scattered bamboo segments and wooden boards as working materials. There are now hundreds of thousands of refugees in Shanghai. Although various charities have tried their best to accommodate them, since the war will not end in a short period of time, the number of refugees in the future will inevitably increase day by day. Those who think that they should help financially will inevitably have a day when supply cannot meet demand. The doctor and others intend to turn consumption into production and unemployment into employment, which is truly a plan to reduce the current serious situation by cutting off the fuel under the cauldron.</p>

<p>The Charity Association of Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association's War Zone Refugee Relief Committee has summarized the work of each share from December 1 to December 10 as follows: ㊀ Accommodation share: A total of 894 refugees were accommodated, bringing the total to 48,971. ㊁ Repatriation share: A total of 1,070 refugees were repatriated, with 130 sent to Ningbo by the China-Italy Company's Ender Wheel, and 940 sent to Tongzhou by the Taikoo Company's Wuxue Wuhu Wheel and the Jardine Company's Pinghe Wheel. ㊂ Western Medicine Department: A total of 1,928 refugees were treated as outpatients, 5,835 were treated as home visits, 123 were sent to the hospital, and 35 died.

<p>Good Deeds at Nanyuan Bookstore</p>
<p>Zhang Jiquan, the owner of Nanyuan Bookstore, is enthusiastic about good deeds. On the 20th of last month, he held a one-day charity event, donating all the proceeds from the day and night sales to purchase eighty sets of cotton jackets and pants. Dong Rongwen raised another forty sets, for a total of one hundred and twenty sets. Yesterday morning, Zhu Guoliang and Shao Bingzhang, together with Zhu Minghua and Wu Jilin from the China Travel Service, directly sent them to the refugee area for distribution. (According to the China Travel Service colleagues' relief team, they have a special license. If there are kind people who are enthusiastic about relief, they can contact the general affairs section of the company to go together for distribution.)</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Office Operates as Usual</h3>
<p>Regarding the management of the Jianghai Customs, according to reports, it has fallen into the hands of the Japanese. According to a certain important official of the customs yesterday, the customs is still operating as usual, and there is no change. If a problem occurs, all orders from the Inspector General of Customs will be listened to to determine the course of action, and said that this is an international issue and cannot be resolved locally.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Vaccination Campaign</h3>
<p>Free Vaccination at Six Designated Locations Residents Can Go to the Nearest Location for Vaccination</p>
<p>In order to prevent the spread of smallpox, the Shanghai Municipal Council is now expanding its vaccination campaign. The reporter of the Dàtong News Agency believes that this matter is extremely important to public health and is here to explore the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Expand Vaccination Campaign</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession attaches great importance to the promotion of vaccination work this winter, because the population in the concession has increased after the war. Recently, the vaccination locations have been expanded. The designated locations for free vaccination for Chinese residents are: ㊀ 340 Hankou Road, ㊁ 1360 Yuyuan Road, two health sub-offices. The time is set as 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day, except Saturdays and Sundays.</p>
<p>Free Vaccination Locations</p>
<p>In addition to the above two locations, there are also the following four health sub-offices: ㊀ 667 Suzhou Road, ㊁ 380 Avenue Edward VII, ㊂ 160 Maignan Road, ㊃ 435 Robison Road, which are also free vaccination locations for Chinese residents. The time is 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, except Saturdays and Sundays. Therefore, residents can go to the nearest convenient location for vaccination to avoid smallpox.</p>
<p>Vaccination Methods for Factories</p>
<p>As for employers of various factories who want to vaccinate a large number of workers, they can call or write to the Health Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council for detailed information about the vaccination situation. The department will take care of it. The telephone number of the Health Department is 12410, extension 23. It is hoped that residents will pay attention to the above vaccination situation and methods.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Retreat from Refugee Zone, Everything Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>Father Jacquinot and others continue to work in the zone as usual. Precautions are taken against petty criminals; entry without a pass is prohibited. Refugees from the French Concession will be moved into the area.</p>
<p>The refugee zone in the Nanshi area experienced a sudden search of residences and shelters by Japanese troops the day before yesterday afternoon, attracting considerable attention from Chinese and foreigners. It is now learned that the Japanese troops in the zone completely withdrew yesterday morning, and everything has returned to normal. To prevent petty criminals from entering the zone, the French Concession authorities have prohibited entry without a pass since yesterday morning. Details of the situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Have Already Withdrawn</p>
<p>At 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, Japanese troops declared martial law in the Nanshi refugee zone and searched residences and shelters. As of yesterday morning, the Japanese troops stationed in the area had completely withdrawn, and traffic had resumed. When reporters inquired with the International Relief Committee about the situation, the committee stated that they had not yet received a report from their office in the zone and that the true situation was still unknown. The director, Father Jacquinot, and various staff members are still in the zone handling various matters. The situation in the zone is currently very good.</p>
<p>No Entry Without a Pass</p>
<p>Since the French Concession authorities opened the Laobeimen iron gate, allowing residents to live in the zone for an extended period, merchants who had been displaced have gradually moved back, and many have resumed business. Many refugees have also been allowed to enter the zone for shelter. To prevent unscrupulous individuals from entering the zone and causing disturbances, the French Concession authorities have prohibited entry without a pass since yesterday morning. Reporters visited Laobeimen and observed that the iron gate was still open as usual, and those with passes could enter and exit. However, many residents without passes were prevented from entering the zone. Pedestrians along Min'guo Road were constantly coming and going, and the Jiu Mu Di vegetable market was as lively as ever. Patrol teams regularly inspect various areas within the zone and strictly prohibit residents from entering the Japanese military restricted area or any adjacent areas to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Teachers to be Released Soon</p>
<p>When Japanese troops searched the refugee zone the day before yesterday, they arrested three teachers, causing considerable fear among the refugees in the zone. According to news yesterday morning, there is hope that the teachers will be released soon.</p>
<p>Surveying Houses by Zone</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the refugee zone in Nanshi, the French Concession authorities have had over forty refugee shelters within the concession, and the large number of refugees is difficult to accommodate. Therefore, they consulted with Father Jacquinot of the International Committee to move refugees from various shelters in the concession to the refugee zone. Consequently, yesterday, personnel were dispatched to the refugee zone to survey various public places and houses, surveying each zone, preparing house plans, and separately counting the number of refugees that can be accommodated. If any large buildings in the zone are inhabited, they must also be vacated to accommodate refugees. Once the house survey is completed, refugees within the concession will be transferred in batches to ensure consistency.</p>
<h3>Bandits Infiltrate Refugee Zone, Shot Dead on the Spot</h3>
<p>More than 20 Arrested, Taken Away for Interrogation</p>
<p>In the Nanshi refugee zone near Fangbang Road and Yimiao and Houjia Road, two bandits suddenly infiltrated and seized goods at approximately 10 AM yesterday. They were spotted by Japanese soldiers and shot dead on the spot. Afterwards, more than 20 people were searched and arrested and taken to the Japanese headquarters for interrogation.</p>
<h3>"Great Dao City Government" Only Police Bureau Established</h3>
<p>Finance, Transportation, and Social Affairs Bureaus Cannot Proceed. Pudong Townships Still in Chaos</p>
<p>Pudong has nominally been open for three days, but there has been no noticeable progress in various areas. Yesterday, a reporter crossed the Huangpu River to investigate the general situation. Regarding the so-called Great Dao City Government, only a police bureau has been established. The bureau is located in Pudong Hospital and is temporarily divided into three sections: General Affairs, Administration, and Judicial Affairs. The head of the General Affairs Section is Xie Kai, and the head of the Judicial Affairs Section is Chuan Yongshou, both of whom are northerners. A detective team has also been established in Chen's Elementary School. The team leader is also a northerner, Wu. Previous reports that Zhang Yong was appointed are untrue. However, Zhang is the head of the Pudong Detective Sub-Team. As for the directly subordinate branch bureaus, there is only one</p>
<p>Pudong Branch Bureau. In addition, there are two sub-stations in Yangjiadu and Yangjing. Wu Shouqing was appointed as a patrol officer in Yangjiadu, and Li Lingwen was appointed as a patrol officer in Yangjing. Each leads more than 20 police officers to maintain order. No police stations have been established in Tangqiao, Yangsiqiao, etc. However, preparations are underway in Gaoqiao Town to establish a sub-station first, but it has not yet been implemented. As for the branch bureaus in Nanshi and Zhabei, they are all in the planning stages. Rumors that the personnel selections have already been internally determined are not accurate. The Finance, Transportation, and Social Affairs Bureaus, which belong to the City Government, are temporarily</p>
<p>unable to proceed because few of the old staff have reported for duty. The bureau chiefs have also not been announced due to a lack of specialized talent. As for the recent situation in various townships, in Yangsiqiao, the southernmost area, Zhang Shangyi has organized a maintenance association. A portion of the villagers continue to reside there and have not moved away. Moving northward in sequence, Tangqiao in Nanmatou is still garrisoned by more than 10 Japanese soldiers. There are very few residents, and the scene is unusually desolate. In Laobaidu and Yangjiadu, local Huang Baokang has organized a maintenance association, and there is also</p>
<p>a police post. Some butchers' shops, small tobacco and paper stores, and small sundry goods stores have opened to maintain the livelihoods of the dockworkers living there. Relying on the entire town of Yidu, except for the main street, which has been burned down, the other streets and shops have not opened. Less than two-tenths of the poor people reside there. There is nowhere to buy food and they must go to Yangjiadu to buy it in small quantities. Vegetables are brought out by villagers in the morning to be sold in the market. Local order is maintained by the police. Five or six Japanese soldiers are guarding the ferry crossing. Those going from Puxi to the Dongchang Road pier must be</p>
<p>thoroughly checked</p>
<p>before being allowed to pass. Further north to Lujiazai Town, most of the once prosperous market streets have been destroyed by fire. The area is within the Japanese military cordon and is deserted. Along the Huangpu River to the east, Qichangzhan Town has no police, and it is entirely deserted, with no organization of any kind, like a dead town. In Yangjing Town, local Gu Jinsheng has organized a maintenance association, and there are more than 20 police officers who assist in maintaining order. Therefore, more than a dozen small restaurants have sprung up to provide food for the workers of various foreign companies and warehouses on the Pudong side. There are also three or four butcher shops open. However, the houses in the town that belong to the Dongshi area were</p>
<p>destroyed by bombs.</p>
<p>Seventy percent of them, and five-tenths of the city were destroyed, presenting a tragic post-war scene everywhere. Further east are Gao Miao and Donggou Towns. No Japanese troops have been stationed there. Currently, half of the residents continue to reside there, and half of the small stores have also opened to serve the market. However, thefts still occur from time to time. When the ferry service opens in Gaoqiao Town, a portion of the residents has moved back. The shops in the town have opened one after another, creating a lively atmosphere. However, the ferry service has now been blocked and suspended, and the market is gradually becoming deserted again. The Pudong Branch Bureau had planned to establish a sub-station in the town, but it has not yet been implemented. Therefore, local order is maintained by the business and farming communities themselves.</p>

<p>① Yongda Trading Company of the Grain Industry ordered 100,000 bags of foreign rice, divided into four batches to be shipped to Shanghai. The first batch of 20,000 bags has already arrived. The second batch of 26,000 bags, loaded on the German ship Mei Zhongmei (i.e., Margaret Jolson), arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 8 AM and docked at the Jinliyuan Wharf. The third batch of 29,000 bags, loaded on the Athens ship, is scheduled to arrive on the 15th. The fourth batch of 25,000 bags has already been loaded and is scheduled to arrive on the 22nd. ② French firm Dufu has continued to order 50,000 bags of foreign rice to be shipped on two ships. The first ship (i.e., the fifth batch), the British Swire Company's Chengdu ship, arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 1 PM and docked at the French Concession Bund pontoon. The second ship (i.e., the sixth batch) is scheduled to arrive on the 16th. Each ship carries 25,000 bags.</p>
<p>Agreed to Relax the Quantity of Rice Sales</p>
<p>Yongda Trading Company and Dufu have dispatched personnel yesterday to handle unloading, which will be received by the Rice Merchants Association and distributed to various rice shops for retail sales. The number of bags of rice received is as follows: ① 8,000 bags from the Mei Zhongmei ship, 40 bags each to 200 rice shops in the French Concession. 6,000 bags will be allocated by the French Public Bureau to the International Relief Committee for distribution. The remaining 12,000 bags have mostly been ordered at fair prices by various factories, companies, and businesses. Therefore, there are very few bags of the second batch of foreign rice remaining. ② 20,000 bags from the Chengdu ship, 40 bags each to 500 rice shops in the Public Concession and French Concession. Chairman Zhang Nianxuan of the Rice Merchants Association, in view of the slightly surging grain supply arriving in Shanghai, has negotiated with the Public Concession and French Concession authorities to relax the quantity of rice purchases from the 12th of this month, with each person allowed to purchase no more than 20 market jin. The price will remain at 8.5 fen per market jin.</p>
<p>Association Issues Notice for Sixth Batch of Rice Distribution</p>
<p>The Rice Merchants Association issued a notice yesterday regarding the handling of the sixth batch of rice distribution, stating, "The Association has scheduled the 13th and 14th of this month to handle the sixth batch of rice distribution and payment procedures. All 500 registered rice shops in the Public Concession and French Concession must bring the number card issued by the Association within the specified period and prepay 10 yuan for vehicle fees to the Association to fill out the rice purchase application form. The deadline will be strictly enforced, so please do not delay. This is a special notice. Also, the deadline for bank payments is the 13th and 14th. Late payments will not be accepted. All rice shops should pay special attention."</p>
<p>Lilo Mail Steamer to Arrive Day After Tomorrow</p>
<p>French firm Dufu, commissioned by various factories and individuals to order a total of approximately 500 tons (5,000 bags) of foreign rice, has loaded it onto the French Mail Steamer Company's Lilo mail steamer for shipment to Shanghai. Yesterday, inquiries with the French Mail Steamer Company revealed that they had received a telegram from the captain of the Lilo mail steamer stating that it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th of this month (Wednesday).</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Claims Body Found in River</h3>
<p>Proves the Deceased Was Japanese; Possibly Drowned After Falling into the Water Due to Injury</p>
<p>At approximately 4 PM the other day, a nameless male body was discovered floating in the filthy water south of the riverbank at the intersection of Jufu Road, west of Maple Forest Bridge in Xujiahui, French Concession. After it was discovered by the concession authorities, because it was related to the sanitation of the concession, they reported it to the French Police, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives along with undertakers from the Renfuyuan sub-hall to explain the situation to the Japanese troops stationed at Maple Forest Bridge. They then used bamboo poles, hemp ropes, and wooden coffins to pull the body to the shore. After the Japanese side confirmed that the body was that of a Japanese person, they refused to allow the Chinese to handle the burial. The next day, the Japanese side collected the body for burial. It is generally speculated that the body may have fallen into the water and drowned due to injury when entering the area. Also, at 9 AM yesterday, another male body floated up in the river opposite 850 Xujiahui Road. The French Police notified the Renfuyuan sub-hall to dispatch undertakers to collect and pull up the body. The upper body of the corpse had completely rotted away, leaving only the limbs and head, all of which were blackened and had a foul odor, making it impossible to identify whether there were any injuries. The body was taken back to the morgue for further examination.</p>
<h3>Additional Ships Operating on the Shanghai-Tongzhou Line</h3>
<p>Endeavor to Sail Through Tomorrow Morning</p>
<p>The regular ships operating on the Shanghai-Tongzhou line include the British Swire's Wuhu and Wuxue, and the British Jardine Matheson's Pinghe and Tonghe, totaling four ships. Now, because the end of the lunar year is approaching, various industries in Shanghai are procuring New Year's goods from Tongzhou, resulting in Tongzhou ships arriving in Shanghai fully loaded each time. The number of passengers traveling to and from Shanghai and Tongzhou has also increased due to year-end account settlements. Various shipping companies have now added ships to operate on the line. The British Swire's Xin Beijing ship sailed through the other day, and the Italian firm Hua Yi's Endeavor ship is scheduled to sail through tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Hongkou District Open, Chinese Excepted</h3>
<p>In recent days, there have been rumors that the Hongkou District will be opened on the 15th of this month. It is now learned that only Westerners and Chinese servants are allowed to enter, while Chinese people are not allowed. Furthermore, they must have a pass issued by the Japanese Consulate to pass through. It is hoped that our countrymen will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Ferry Service on the Pudong-Gaoqiao Line Still Not Resumed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Pudong-Gaoqiao line ferry service has been blocked and suspended for three days. Although the Ma Li Company and others have made efforts to negotiate and mediate, there has been no progress yet. Therefore, traffic between Pudong and Puxi yesterday remained cut off. Ordinary civilians and vegetable vendors are eagerly hoping for an early resumption of service so that they can continue to sell vegetables and firewood to maintain their livelihoods.</p>
<p>Transportation in Pudong has been intermittent in recent days. The Gaoqiao line has been blocked so far. There are still illegal ferry ships operating to and from Donggou and Jiajiajiao. Yesterday, a large number of vegetables, chickens, ducks, cattle, and sheep were transported from the Pudong countryside. As for foreign companies such as British American Tobacco, they are currently planning to fully resume work. Therefore, many small ferries are being prepared to transport factory workers.</p>
<h3>Foggy for Several Days, Warm Weather in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Vegetable Pests Affect Spring Plowing</p>
<p>Shanghai has been shrouded in fog for several days, which has taken a long time to dissipate. The weather is also extremely mild, unlike winter. Frost has not been seen on the roofs for several days. As a result of the warm weather, crops and vegetables in the fields are prone to pests. Therefore, the quantity on the market will inevitably decrease, and prices will inevitably continue to rise. This will also have a significant impact on planting in the spring of next year.</p>
<h3>Nanshi to Have Organization</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, gentlemen and merchants in Nanshi, in view of the current situation, which is bound to be prolonged, and the cold weather, which makes it impossible for displaced refugees to endure the wind and dew, have discussed solutions and selected more than ten representatives, all of whom are prominent figures in the business community, to temporarily maintain the status quo. This can be formally established within a week.</p>
<p>According to another report, the Japanese suddenly imposed a special curfew on the city and suburbs of Nanshi, and even the refugee zone was searched. In recent days, a Japanese pacification team in the city and suburbs of Nanshi has been advising our residents to return home and live in peace, but there has been no solution to date. This is because there is no water or electricity, and food is scarce. Those with even a little property are unwilling to try.</p>
<h3>International Relief Committee Continues to Collect One-Corner Donations</h3>
<p>Donations from Organizations and Individuals Are Very Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee continues to collect one-corner donations from all sectors of society, including 400 yuan in celebratory gifts from relatives and friends of Luo Xinrong's granddaughter's one-month celebration, 102 yuan in celebratory gifts from relatives and friends of Wang Aiting's son's one-month celebration, 100 yuan from Pu Zhisheng's cancellation of the Christmas banquet fee, 30 yuan from Fang Shuping's winnings from righteousness mahjong, and 219 yuan from the Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry Association's annual fundraising of six copies, 33 yuan and one corner from the Shanghai Money and Banking Industry Association, and enthusiastic donations from the science departments of Shanghai High School and individuals.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai United Benefit Association Investigates Factory Management</h3>
<p>Pays Attention to the Situation of Female Workers, Assesses Work Skills</p>
<p>Various yarn factories in West Shanghai, in order to develop wartime industry, increase production efficiency, and maintain the livelihoods of workers, have reopened their factories. However, most of the original workers have left Shanghai due to the war and returned to their hometowns. Therefore, there has been a shortage of manpower for some time. Various yarn factories have successively commissioned the Shanghai West Shanghai United Benefit Association to introduce skilled female workers for large-scale employment. The Association actively handled the registration of female yarn factory workers, and the number of applicants exceeded one thousand. The Association selected female workers with excellent skills and sent them to various factories for employment, numbering no fewer than several hundred. The Association has continued to conduct this registration of female workers in recent days. According to investigation reports, each yarn factory's management of workers, workers' skills, work efficiency, and assessment conditions must be thoroughly investigated to urge improvement.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang Police Boat Lights to Be Changed Gradually</h3>
<p>Customs Has Instructed Shippers to Pay Attention; No Difficulty for Ships Traveling on the Yangtze River</p>
<p>The lights on the Zhenjiang section of the Yangtze River police boat were originally scheduled to be changed within the day by customs, and the Patrol and Construction Department has informed Chinese and foreign shippers in Mubu accordingly. Due to the sudden outbreak of the war in Zhenjiang, the change of the police boat lights has been temporarily postponed. Recently, the Patrol and Construction Department re-instructed various shipping companies to pay attention. It is also learned that the water volume of the Yangtze River basin has recently stabilized in its retreat. Yichang still maintains a water level of 10 feet and 2 inches, and Hankou also maintains a water level of over 31 feet. Therefore, there is no difficulty in traveling on the middle and lower reaches of the river. Various shipping companies have also not discussed increasing the freight rates for shallow-water shipping on the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Police Department Releases Information on Robbery Cases in the Concession</h3>
<p>Number of Incidents in October This Year Increased Compared to the Same Time Last Year</p>
<p>According to the Public Concession Bureau Police Department, the number of robbery cases that occurred in the concession in October this year clearly increased significantly compared to the same time last year. In October this year, there were 41 armed robbery cases in the concession, while in October last year there were only 32. In October this year, there were 9 other robbery cases, while in October last year there were only 8. In October this year, there were 46 cases of intrusion into homes, offices, and shops, while in October last year there were only 42.</p>
<h3>Thugs Rob on Kang'naidao Road</h3>
<p>A local man, Chen, residing in Caojiadu in West Shanghai, was returning home in the early hours of yesterday when he was suddenly blocked by five thugs wearing short clothes while passing through Kang'naidao Road and Xingjiapo Road. The thugs forcibly robbed Chen of his clothes, worth approximately 30 to 40 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>Special Second Court Investigates Impersonation of Plaintiff</h3>
<p>Case of Russian Resident Abusing Checks; Yang Fen Repeatedly Sues in Someone Else's Name</p>
<p>A local man, Hu Shanlai, recently filed a lawsuit in the criminal court of the Special Second Court, suing Russian resident Munmdufu (transliteration) for abusing checks, totaling 220 yuan in HSBC checks, requesting an investigation. The court approved the request, and on November 27, it summoned both parties to court for a hearing. The plaintiff did not appear. However, Yang Fen (45 years old), a Ningbo native residing at 105 Jin Shenfu Road, appeared and impersonated the plaintiff, Hu Shanlai, stating the intent of the lawsuit and presenting two blank HSBC checks for 500 yuan. The court ordered a reschedule for a later hearing. At the time, Yang signed a "Hu" character on the record. On the 9th of this month, at the resumption of the hearing, Yang appeared again, impersonating the plaintiff. Unexpectedly, the lawyer representing the plaintiff stated that the plaintiff who appeared last time and this time was not the plaintiff Hu Shanlai himself and was an imposter. The judge repeatedly questioned Yang, and Yang finally admitted that he was not Hu Shanlai himself but was commissioned by Hu Shanlai. The judge was furious, stating that since Yang was not the plaintiff, he should not have rashly appeared in court to impersonate him, which was a violation of the law and litigation procedure and extremely abhorrent. He ordered the bailiffs to transfer Yang to the bailiff's office for investigation and punishment. After investigation by the bailiff's office, a written confession and report were submitted, and Yang was sent to the Special Second Court, where the bailiff's office lawyer filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 214 of the Criminal Law for the crime of forging documents. On the morning of the other day, Judge Zhang presided over the hearing in Criminal Court Eight. The bailiff's office lawyer first stated the facts of the case and requested an investigation in accordance with the law. When questioned, Yang Fen confessed that he and Hu Shanlai were friends and that Hu had instructed him to appear in court on his behalf. The official asked why he did not explain that he was commissioned by Hu to appear in court when he opened the hearing and instead signed the "Hu" character on the record, which clearly showed an intent to impersonate. At this point, Yang admitted his mistake, stating that he had recently been suffering from mental disorder and requested leniency. The court verified the confession and ordered Yang to provide a 300 yuan guarantee from a shop that he would be available at any time and scheduled the sentencing for 9 AM on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<h3>Relief for Refugees</h3>
<p>Personally Sending Cotton Clothes</p>
<p>At this time of cold and freezing weather, the city's refugees are standing and shivering, filling the eyes everywhere. Recently, philanthropist Mrs. Tan Hongpu personally went to the Eighth Shelter on Sanma Road and Shilou yesterday to inspect the situation and generously sent 30 newly made cotton clothes, which were handed over to Director Bao Shangxian for distribution. The refugees who received this benefit were all moved to tears and were extremely grateful. It is hoped that philanthropists in Shanghai will hear about this and be inspired to take action.</p>
<h3>Donating Seasonal Essential Medicines</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai War, the number of fellow countrymen suffering from illness has been increasing daily. It has been learned that the Tongchang Car Company on Yunnan Road in Shanghai has been producing Domination Pills, which are specially effective for treating various seasonal epidemics, measles, chills, and colds, and Throat Pain Powder, which is specially effective for treating various throat conditions. Both are extremely effective. Those with the above-mentioned ailments can call 90152, and the company will dispatch someone to deliver the medicine by bicycle. However, in order to maintain the effectiveness of the medicine and benefit the patients, it is manufactured and delivered immediately, and it must be taken on the spot. Prevention for the healthy is not provided. A prescription is included with the medicine. If you are willing to prepare and donate according to the prescription, the merit will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Cheap Goods at Chinese and Western Pharmacy</h3>
<p>In order to thank customers, the Chinese and Western Pharmacy on Sima Road will not only offer a 20% discount on Blood-in-Blood, which nourishes and replenishes blood, and New Brainpower, which nourishes and strengthens the brain, but will also add a gift for the next two days. As for Star Vitamin, Wheat Germ Cod Liver Oil, Nine Star Vitamin Milky White Cod Liver Oil, Vitamin Chicken Broth, Vitamin Beef Broth, and Nine Star Egg Yolk Malt Essence Cod Liver Oil, which helps to quit smoking, buy two get one free. A large 1-pound bottle of Snow White Cream is reduced to 6 jiao. If you purchase a bottle of Eleuthero-Vitamin, which prevents beriberi, you will also receive a 20% discount.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Xin'zha Road</h3>
<p>Xin'zha Road in the Public Concession, stretching approximately three or four miles from Beinicheng Bridge in the east to Jiaozhou Road in the west, is only separated from Zhabei by a river. Therefore, it is usually the most lively street on the border between the Chinese and foreign concessions. After the outbreak of the August 13th Shanghai War, refugees from Hongkou and Zhabei took refuge in the area, and even now, despite the traffic being blocked, the liveliness of the area has not changed from the past. At 7 AM yesterday, a certain gentleman made a special trip to inspect the road. Passing through Beinicheng Bridge towards the west, he saw male and female coolies coming and going along the road. The cement sidewalk in front of the Dashun Silk Store at the intersection of Meibai Grid Road was filled with leather stalls, both new and old. It is said that these leather stalls are set up around 5 AM every morning and removed around 8 AM. Chengdu Road, from Xin'zha Road to Shanhai'guan Road, is a temporary vegetable market in the morning and a secondhand goods market in the afternoon, with stalls set up in the middle of the road, crowded with buyers and sellers, and very lively. The refugees in the Jiangning and Six Counties Fellow Association at the corner of the road are still piled up, with men, women, old, and young sitting and lying on the ground. The Pingjiang Public Office refugee at the corner of Da Tong Road also has many refugees. A sign is posted at the door saying, "Quota is full, no more admissions." Wandering refugees have not disappeared from the various alleyways. Although various fellow associations and organizations have tried to take them in, they come and go in the morning and evening, constantly moving.</p>
