<p>時評</p>
<h3>願政府積極扶植言論界星</h3>
<p>年來關於言論自由問題。朝野人士發表意見甚多。然一針見血。莫如二十二日蔣委員長所發表之談話。對於中央關於輿論應取之方針。過去新聞政策之弊端。今後輿論界應走之途徑。以簡單明了之數語。啟發無遺。尤其是對於“今後中央更當改善管理新聞與出版物之辦法。且當進一步扶助言論出版事業之發展”之期許。使全國輿論界額手稱慶。最高領袖旣有此項適合民意之表示。全國上下。如果一本此旨。積極努力。則不但言論界之幸。亦國民之福也。</p>
<p>夫言論自由。憲章早有規定。對於報業之獎良除莠。黨中負責人物亦早有表示。言論界在此國難嚴重時期。當前任務。為集中意志。鼓吹救亡圖存運動。造成舉國一致之民族意識。爭民族之自由平等。努力於國家經濟及文化之建設。凡報界中不問為政府機關報或商業性質報紙。苟非漢奸赤匪之工具。當無不同之目的。中國今日新聞事業。以種種物質的文化的社會的限制。發達不易。現有之成局。只有設法使其日新月異。更無予以破壞摧殘與壓迫之理。故必以獎良為除莠之手段。以扶掖達糾正之目的。果一味用消極之方法。兩敗俱傷。國家蒙其損失。政府亦無以善其後也。</p>
<p>今言論界有賴於政府積極扶植之事甚多。無論在物質方面。人材方面。以及工具方面。要政府稍稍了解作報之困難。及健全輿論機關在此非常時期之必要。决無袖手旁觀之理。報業之不振。泰半因為經濟之困難。中國人民貧窮。購買力薄弱。報紙不敢抬價。中國之商業衰微。廣告份量少而價格低。報紙於廣告商人。不敢多有所求。然報館之機器。舶來品也。報館之用紙。舶來品也。其價甚昂。近月以來。紙價大漲。各報生存。除少數歷史久遠經濟組織健全者外。均入於風雨飄搖之狀態。用紙問題。政府如不减低關稅。使其價减低。或早辦紙廠。廉價供給各報。則此問題必成為報業前途之大害。此經濟之一端。亦最要之一端也。</p>
<p>人材之缺乏。亦為私營報紙所感受之至大困難。大規模之人材訓練。亦非政府之力莫舉。新聞採拾之困難。外藉通信機關之跋扈。亦朝野所明知。而大規模國際通訊機關之組織。亦為政府應興之事業。電綫電波。報紙藉以取得新聞者。亦宜更减低價格。鐵道飛機。報紙所藉以輸送者。亦應予報界以優待。東西洋各國。郵電及交通機關。優待報紙者。無微不至。唯如此報業始可發達。唯如此健全之輿論始可造成。吾人非强政府以各種義務。而忘本身之應有義務。蓋報業與他種營利事業本有不同。個人如欲圖大利。發大財。則洋塲十里。百貨商店也。棉織麵粉也。無物無發財之可能。何必定從業於帶有危險性而利薄潤少之報業哉。報業為公共事業。為文化事業。與興學校辦慈善同一性質。辦報者不可以營利為唯一目的。故政府亦不可以一般產業視報業。此報業之所宜特別自勉。而政府之所以特別愛護扶掖報紙也。</p>
<p>今也何如。除少數有聲望之報紙外。大多數報紙。收入不足以自給。圖利急切者。不得不减低其標準。所用人材不能不求之於水準以下。所登廣告。不能不求之於社會利益水準以下。所登新聞。不得不求之於中級趣味以下。更可憫者。利用報紙。為各種不能自圓之行動。試觀許多低劣報紙之收支平衡表。其支出之數。有否百分之百。取之於正常之賣報所得與正當廣告所得者。乎政府徒限制新聞。限制經營。而不為新聞事業打出一康莊大道。欲不良狀况之消滅。又何異於緣木而求魚。而今以後。願司新聞管理機關。秉最高領袖之諾言。積極扶植言論界。則報紙幸甚。黨國幸甚。</p>

<h3>滬日商工會會長開陳對華意見</h3>
<p>中國政治經濟突飛猛晉　力勸朝野改變對華政策</p>
<p>（東京）上海日本商工會議所會長及日本三菱銀行上海支行經理吉田政治、現由東京商工會議所刊發小冊子一本、內容對中國之經濟統制•中日政治經濟關係•及日本人民對華之認識、發表坦白之意見、至堪注意、吉田在小冊子中、極力敦勸日本朝野務必乘目前之時機、完全改變對華之認識、並列舉日本對華政策謬誤之許多實例、吉田指出中國國民政府已完全獲得控制財政及經濟之權力、並謂日本認為國民政府之興衰、與所謂江浙財政家有關、但目前國民政府已可享受全國之經濟利益、此則為中國有史以來所未有者也、日本感覺中國缺乏統一、以為中國人民猶如散沙之不能團結、但現時之沙已堅如水泥矣、此則應歸功於日本及其他國家之壓迫而有之反響也、吉田繼指斥若干日人所持中國財政狀况不穩定之意見、而斷言中國財政狀况現已穩固、可由國際支付之、極大改善而證明之、同時提出二點、為中國政府所應重加考慮者、㊀為中央財政之集中、於上海及南京二地集資過鉅、而對各省則予忽視、㊁為過分信賴外國、吉田嗣於述及中日關係之前途時、率直表示悲觀預料經濟合作旣不可能、自中日兩國間之各種政治文化關係完全瀕於破裂後、日本卽應由經濟合作與華保持友誼、惟日本採取相反之方策、招致日本對華經濟關係之退步、例如一九三五年日本對中國幣制改革之態度及所謂華北特殊貿易等、日本或認其態度為合理、但中國感覺此種態度、極屬無理、且亦費解、各列强現方力首創造新機會、以應付新局勢、而日本獨袖手旁觀、關於老生常談之經濟合作、吉田謂此種合作、僅在中國仍在半封建與半殖民地狀况下及中國仍為原始的農業國家時始為可能、惟中國近來政治及經濟已突飛猛進、結果使中國人民對彼等之命運有誠摯之感覺、加之歐美在華勢力所佔之優勢、皆使中日關係較前惡化、吉田結論主張日本不應忽視局勢而漠不關心、務必設法改善對華關係、吉田最後作警告語日、日本必須芟除嚴峻之對華政策、而採取在道德上能為中國政府接受且切實際之政策、並謂日本指摘中國蔑視誠意或採取還交近攻之政策等等、實屬荒謬、蓋日本外交及政府當局亦須負其一部份之責任也云云、（中央社二十八日電）</p>
<h3>日本議會戰現入於第三期</h3>
<p>預算總會開分科會　滿洲事件機密費用途　民政黨議員提出質問</p>
<p>（東京）廿八日之議會、僅衆院於上午十時以後一齊開分科會、第一日僅前哨的質問戰、故均於正午以後散會、一到明日卽入於第三期戰、（廿八日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）從十七日起繼續論戰十日之衆院預算總會、廿七日質問完畢、廿八日雖係星期、上午十時起一齊開預算分科會、各省預算在分科會分別所管、從事審議至三月三日止、質疑四、日在此期間內、政府將表明問題之電力統制案、義務教育延長案、所以未提出於本屆議會、又他方交欵增額問題亦必解决、三月四日再開預算總會、五日各黨决定態度、六日表决預算案、（廿八日同盟電）</p>
<p>（東京）日預算總會第四分科會今日討論陸軍費時、民政黨某議員質問、謂滿洲事件費用中、曾有七百萬元擴充機密費之用、其宗旨何在、另一民政黨議員指出日本每年之陸軍機密費不逾二十七萬元、而滿洲事件費中之機密費自一九三二年以來、於五年中其總額竟達四千八百萬元之鉅、繼謂如外傳此種機密費之大部分、係重入吾國充作政治之用一點、果屬鑿實、則與原來陸軍所負之使命大相逕庭矣云、陸軍次官梅津美治郎答稱、滿洲事件機密費應與“滿洲國”機密費劃分清楚、其中一文之支出、均未與原來目的相反、至此種欵項係用於內政者、則屬極端不確云、民政黨議員又提質問曰、師團得增加至若何範圍、駐滿洲之師團增加後、國內之陸軍軍隊將予削减乎、梅津答曰、師團之增加與否、目前實難</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>加以明白之説明、但陸軍軍力之將增厚則係事實、滿洲軍力之增加、並不减削國内之軍力云、總觀上述之問答、可以發現兩疑點、第一過去五年中用於滿洲機密費、約近一千萬元、究為何事、第二新預算已列入擴軍經費、則日本軍隊增加之數量究至幾何云、（中央二十八電）</p>

<h3>塲地潮濕不易捉摸平漢昨敗於勞逸爾</h3>
<p>前半時負兩球後半時又失四隻　曹秋亭一脚破鴨蛋終成六對一　一行定今晨八時離滬返漢</p>
<p>平漢鐵路足球隊、於廢暦新年中、遨遊平津、所向無敵、此次載譽南來、於本月廿二日抵滬　擬向本市中西勁旅如東華法商等挑戰、詎抵滬之期、適值兩埠際隊遠行甫返、旅途辛苦、應戰為艱、致均遭婉拒、乃由協進會周家騏之執柯、始約定英軍勞逸兩隊作戰、於昨日在申園交鋒、惟因雨後、球塲飽吸水份、濘滑不堪、售座亦僅四成、雙方球員、個個跌成如無錫泥阿福、球重而濕、脚頭難以施展、局勢亦因而减却不少精彩、結果平漢以六對一慘遭敗績、全隊定今晨八時搭早快車北上、轉隴海路返漢、昨賽戰情如下、</p>
<p>平漢開球</p>
<p>先攻、閻承寬交球前方、許文奎舉足便射、惜偏尺許未中、英軍從左路進展、夏泊爾斯射門、恰從左上角落下、極刁鑽、幸燕棠華輕托成角球、十分鐘時、特飛於罰球綫上挑射、恰切橫木彈入、燕躍起擋阻、從指尖漏入、英軍</p>
<p>先開紀錄</p>
<p>未幾平漢隊又遇險、當燕臥掠推勒遠射、竟因地滑不能躍起遂陷重圍、幸身手靈敏、未遭失落、旋自陳鎮祥於敵門前廿五碼處、罰任意球無效、推勒傳中、關技揚失足、燕亦滑跌仆地、奧托爾適伺於旁、一撥入網、英軍已於十三分鐘內</p>
<p>連獲兩球</p>
<p>此後許文奎曹秋亭張金海壘有佳機、均以脚頭難展、失却機會、英軍則攻勢極盛、燕棠華生意興隆、拳揮手托、八面玲瓏、救出不少險球、前半時終了、平漢以二比零落後、</p>
<p>檸檬以後</p>
<p>平漢張德江曹秋亭聯袂沿左邊銳進、耶茲不及阻止、張傳中地位極佳、麥克奔出營救、成一空門、惜曹適踐濘地、遭滑仆、遂被麥從</p>
<p>平漢足球隊</p>
<p>容俯拾、相持十分鐘、夏泊爾斯右角邊射燕被濘住、不能撲救、眼看球從右柱彈入、成三比零、中綫開球後、夏泊爾斯又一刁射、擦柱而過、此後平漢以曹秋亭改任右翼、與張德江互調位置、頗有多次進展機會、均不成功、不久英軍克萊登又中一球、</p>
<p>成四比零</p>
<p>此時英軍更以全力進攻、兩衛亦越出中綫、燕棠華一時生意興隆、至卅五分鐘時曹秋亭忽然得勢、單騎銳進、於罰球綫上力射、從麥克掖下穿入、平漢始得扳回一球、無如喜氣甫過、推勒又盤過尹關、輕挑進網、不久克萊登又於人叢中撥進一只、平漢雖亦兩得門下機會、終因張德江略慢一步、曹秋亭脚頭無力、以六對一失敗、平漢隊陣容如下、</p>
<p>武貴成　張德江　關技揚　曹秋亭　燕棠華　陳鎮祥　許文奎　尹政達　張金海　趙啟春　閻承寬</p>
<h3>港尋常杯</h3>
<p>南華南希望亦高</p>
<p>（香港二十八日電）二十八日尋常杯中華對海軍、因海軍多以新進出塲、戰鬥力不强、上半時中華李德琪先中兩球、因越界作廢、郭英琪繼陷一城、始開紀錄、下半時李德琪用頭擊入一球、結果三比中華勝、南華華對聖約瑟、南隊健將林德譜卓石金缺席、以乙組人員替補、陣容不整、竭力應戰、上半時各無所得、下半時各勝一球和、誠屬幸事、又南華南戰九華會、惠堂未出、改以馮景祥任中鋒、實力較遜、上半時黃美順踢入一自由球、下半時馮踢中一角球、結果二比零南華南勝、奪標希望增高</p>

<h3>戴麟經一手包辦東華四比二勝西捕</h3>
<p>上半時凈負兩球下半時反敗為勝</p>
<p>本週甲組、原舊四塲、前日週六既因雨被阻、昨日西商對沙谷爾亦因跑馬廳塲濕改期、故僅祇東華與西捕在市體育塲照常交鋒、結果東華在前半時因逆風關係、致凈負兩球、後半時倍見努力由戴麟經一手包辦四球反以四對二獲勝、至昨日尚有進德對猶太之晨聯賽塲、亦因虹口公園停止開放而展期、茲將東華與西捕之戰情、簡誌如次</p>
<p>戰笛聲裏、東華逆風先攻、孫錦順因故臨時缺席、戰約五分鐘、西捕中鋒道格拉斯順風進展、低射進網、張榮才措手不及、被西捕先開紀錄、東華埋頭奮進、終因地滑不易把捉、盡失交臂、詎一波方平、道格拉斯又捲土重來、趁門前雜亂之際、頭攻獲逞、西捕於十五分鐘內、已連勝兩球氣燄不司一世、東華嚴約部屬、力圖進展、局勢果然一變、良機更番迭至、無如地位逆風、機會疊失、前半因以○比二落後、</p>
<p>檸檬後、東華鎮靜應付、交戰甫六分鐘、戴麟經得錢敬鏞之妙傳、一舉中的、扳回一球、再隔五分鐘、又得十二碼機會、戴又執罰命中、剎時間已成二比二平分秋色、東華氣勢益壯、進攻益力、十九分鐘時、梅恩正持球在手東華取包圍形勢、詎透納舉足踢人、再罰十一碼球、戴麟經從容不迪大功告成、三比一東華從此趨於領導地位、此後西捕雖竭力反攻、但局勢終操縱於東華之手、迨最後離終塲之三四分鐘間、戴麟經於門下用左足反身低射、又中左角、遂以四對二反敗為勝矣、</p>

<h3>嚴諤聲談所得稅各商號應趕速申報</h3>
<p>資本及存款限期已到　商民擁護良稅須速辦</p>
<p>新聲社云、所得稅資本及存欵申報、依照財政部規定、限至二月底截止、而各公司商號、對於申報手續、尚有未盡明瞭者、紛紛向市商會詢問、茲由市商會秘書嚴諤聲、報告各節如下、</p>
<p>資本申報</p>
<p>對於申報資本、手續甚為簡單、商號創辦至今、如資本額無變更者、可依照原有資本數報告、如有變更、亦可照變更數報告、卽報告以後、續有變更、仍可隨時申報、並不受任何拘束、至商家請求、將公積併入資本計算、現尚在所得稅事務處考慮之中、大致可望採納、但現時申報、不必將公積列入、因申報資本是一問題、將來併入公積計算資本又是一問題、資本申報表上、既無公積一項、則公積自可暫時不報、</p>
<p>存款申報</p>
<p>存欵申報、係為征收存欵利息所得稅之準備、並無其他用意、前各業公會因財政部曾有取締商店存欵乏令、疑其中報後將發生其他問題者、係屬誤會、因財政部所取締者、為設存欵部名義、吸收現金、以公開方式、招攬儲蓄存欵而言、至商店存欵、不外店東夥友、以及親戚故舊間之存入、既非儲蓄存欵、又非公開招收、自不在取締範圍之內、且現在存欵申報表、僅列存欵種類•戶數•存欵總數•三項、既不需逐戶填明報告、自不致有何疑慮、至存欵利息所得、銀錢業扣千分之十手續費、卽僅實繳千分之四十、（依條例應收千分之五十）商店存欵、將來自可同樣辦理、所得稅事務處上海辦事處第四號通告、亦有按照銀錢業通案辦法、扣繳所得稅之語、現商會為更求明確起見、已再函辦事處、再予措示矣、</p>
<p>罰則解釋</p>
<p>申報資本、申報存欵、為國民擁擠政府推行良稅應盡之義務、故現雖過期、仍須趕辦、將來因手續關係、延緩數日、當有可諒之處、但商家亦有疑及將受暫行條例第十八條科以二十元以下罰金處分者、則又屬誤會、因條例第十八條處分、係指條例所規定之報告所得額而言、並不指施行細則所規定之報告資本額、更非指條例及細則均未規定之報告存欵也、惟罰則雖不適用、而商民仍應踴躍申報、此項申報表、現市商會亦有代發、可以索取、如有疑慮、亦可詢問、或參考商會發行之所得稅條例淺釋也、</p>

<h3>兩年來的四川財政與經濟</h3>
<p>— 甘祠森</p>
<p>自從剿赤軍事告一段落，四川新省政府成立以來（二十四年二月），川省大局，表面是由一個混亂的，複雜的階段達到了一個清明的，統一的局面。財政預算的確立，生產建設的鼓吹，以及一部份苛雜的廢除與救濟農村之實施，都是十分令人樂觀的現象。雖然這種現象，在實質上或許尚難免令人懷疑，在程度上更不能令人卽時滿意。到川省來旅行或考察的朋友，我們往往見到他們帶回去極端不同的矛盾的觀感。這或許便是這種現象的反映。現在民國二十五年已經過去了，川省新政實施以來也足滿兩個年頭了，在這時候來談談川省財政經濟的現狀，或許是為關心川事的人們所樂聞的吧。</p>
<p>㊀捉衿見肘的財政</p>
<p>記得大公報的記者曾經批評川省財政的現况為從“有財無政”到“苛而不擾”（註一），這句話沒有一點誇張的成份。在二十四年度以前，川省處於軍閥割據的局面下，一切稅捐的徵收，一切經費的支出，都是廳憑當地軍政長官一己的意旨。沒有預算，也沒有一定的稅率。因為各軍軍人自身的揮霍和戰爭的需要，人民的負擔是不斷的增加，田賦預征至民國七八十年，商貨稅捐超過於其原來價值，一倍兩倍，可說是那時“司空見慣”的事了。</p>
<p>這種無盡的搜刮所造成的結果是農村破產，商貨阻滯，以及一切不忍見聞的悽慘之狀；所以當二十四年二月新省府成立的時候，政府卽以“與民更始”為號召，宣佈了整理稅捐的新法，編成了二十四年度的預算。</p>
<p>二十四年度川省財政預算的成立，是經過相當困難的，因為一方要顧慮人民的擔負，一方又有龐大的軍事用費的支出。在這種兩難的情形下，政府仍是只得犧牲前者，採行了所謂剿匪期間徵收臨時軍費的辦法，替換了從前的預征。臨時軍費的徵收，是按一年田賦附加臨時軍費三倍的，換句話說，就是每年要徵收糧賦四次。這種辦法，對於從前徵收甚苛的地方，自然是相當地减輕；而對於從前榨取較輕的地方，則反較前加重不少；就全省平均計算，收入額可說是沒有什麼增减。至於捐稅方面，政府所公佈的法令，是要取消從前的苛雜，而實行統一的稅制。但是一稅制的稅率，並不比苛雜相加的總和更輕，這雖然减少了商民從前遭受關卡留難的痛苦，而在負擔上說起來，却是並沒有兩樣；這無怪乎大公報的記者要議之為“苛而不擾”，而作者也不免義憤填膺地在另一篇文章裏詆這種辦法為“非專憑口惠所能奏效也了。（註二）</p>
<p>捐稅辦法對於人民的負擔雖然不曾减輕，而其實施的結果，在收入方面，因為天災和匪禍的區域擴大，糧稅收入减少；又中央舉辦統稅，棉紗捲烟等入口貨的地方稅停徵，收入更形低减；而在支出方面，不得不爾的軍事開支，常在預算之外，這一來使得政府苦心孤詣造成的預算平衡，又不得不被破壞了。據官方公布的數字，二十四年度開始九個月的收支差額，就達到一千五百萬元之鉅！</p>
<p>對於這大量的收支差額，政府不是沒有方法彌補的，除了發行第二次善後公債二千萬元外（二十五年四月一日發行），如營業稅之舉辦（地方稅仍照常徵收），保安經費（一年糧稅額），地方附加稅及其他苛雜之陸續徵收，在在皆成為歛聚的手段。這些沉重的負擔，使困處於橫徵暴歛下二十餘年來的川民沒有得到一點蘇息的機會，就連省主席劉湘，也不禁發出“一年來對於减輕川人負擔之工作，毫未做到”的感慨。</p>
<p>二十四年度的財政難關是那樣勉強地渡過了。二十五年度的財政預算，在中央與省府要人經過不少次的商討與修改以後，也於八月中公佈出來了。本年的預算，數字上比較上年顯然地有所增加，而其特質則並沒有兩樣。兩年預算的內容略如下表（註三）：（以國幣千元為單位）</p>
<p>收入之部</p>
<p>比較兩年度的財政預算，我們可以看出來二十五年度財政預算的幾個特點：第一是田賦附徵臨時軍費三倍的辦法，仍然沒有改變；這使我們不能不疑問，倒底所謂蘇解民困的謊言，是否永久只是一個難於實現的夢想？第二是預算數字的膨大。在收入方面，新增有營業稅土地稅登記稅統礦稅等項目，這些新稅的收入，是否確有把握，抑僅作為支持大量軍費債費支出的陪襯？第三，在本年度財政預算中，支出項目仍以軍費債費佔據了絕對的多數，—竟佔全部支出十分之八九——，這種現象，因為要支持大量的軍事用費，一方不得不縮减其他政費，阻碍文化與建設的發展；一方又不得不增重人民的負擔。在這兩方面都有所未足，於是又不能不大量舉債而增加支出債務的開支。在這樣周而復始的途徑上，人民固然是“焦頭爛額”，政府也顯盡其“苦心孤詣”。對於本年度的預算，我們就曾見對前財政廳坐辦嵇祖佑氏發表過下面的談話（註四）：</p>
<p>“…………（上略）關於二十五年度預算，完全是由劉廳長負責辦理，收支實數大約是八千五六百萬左右，報到中央去之後，財部對收支方面略有變更，最重要的硬是望將軍費縮减，拿四川目前的情形來說，“軍費約佔全部預算的二分之一自然是比較龐大一點，但是，事實上又絕對沒有其他方法可以减少，因此，面謁蔣院長，說明川省的情形，才將數字决定下來，（…………）數字雖然已定，可是有些數字都是要十分努力，或另用其他方法來彌補現在就拿一個田賦的收入作例子，今年初定的是二千六百萬元，二十四年所收之數不過二千萬元，今年卽使很努力的辦去，最大限度也不過增加一二百萬元，要想達到二千六百萬元的數字，很不容易，其次是禁烟罰金，去年收入還不到六百萬元，而今年的預算竟列為九百萬元，數字上增加了三百萬元、當此禁烟森嚴，吸烟的人口漸减少，罰金收入何能增加，再次說到營業稅，營業稅，預算可收入三百六十多萬元，而大家公認為收入最多的重慶，每月最多也不過四萬元，以全川說，加上收入多一點的縣份，也决不能達到預算的數目，如此，又有二百萬元是希望中的數目，總之，二十五年度列為收入預算，不然認為確有把握者，大約佔一千餘萬元，蔣院長也曾向劉廳長說過，這些不可靠的數字，列入預算，是為辦財政的最忌諱的，其實，劉廳長何嘗不知道，只是唯恐收入數字减少，則四千萬元的軍費必會發生問題，其影響又是何種重大，故明知如此，而不能不負起負任去做，以另謀補救的方法，說到補救的方法，現在已經想到的是換發新契，在預算收入方面約可增加一部份，因為四川過去是防區時代，人民在買賣房屋，總是想着種種的方法避免完稅，而且不合法，不合手續的契據很多，現在既是統一時期，應為整理，換發新契，略取工本及手續費，以四川地土之大，收入自有可觀”（下略）</p>
<p>原來“另尋途徑”的方法，仍不外乎向人民“換發新契”之類。川省財政的拮据，川省人民的痛苦，由此顯見無遺了。</p>
<p>㊁每下愈况的產業</p>
<p>關於川省的經濟地位，作者曾在一本書的序文裏說過如下的話（註五）：</p>
<p>“由川省進出口商品之分析，吾人可瞭然於川省所處之經濟地位。在吾人選取之二十二種重要進口商品中，幾全數皆為機製貨物或機器產品；而二十餘種重要出口貨物，則又多為山貨藥材等原料及未製品。機製各貨，吾人尤不可不注意者，卽疋頭食品等生活必需品輸入量之特多，與乎機器生產用具等輸入量之微薄；此不特表示本省工業基礎，至為薄弱；卽生活必需，亦需仰給於外方；此實吾人所宜痛自警惕者也。”</p>
<p>四川的產業地位，就是這樣一個原始的生產原料的供給者。有人說四川是“天府之國”，因為她尚有未盡開發的富源（雖然實際的情况或許並不能如理想之美滿）；也有人盛讚她的“物產豐僥”，四川並不愧於這一種稱呼，因為各種生活必需品中，除了“衣”的原料稍覺欠缺外，四川都可以自給。但是，豐饒的物產，是否得到了堅固的保育？已有的產業，果眞能有維持或向上的希望麼？我們考察了近幾年的情形，着實有些悲觀。</p>
<p>提到四川的物產，我們第一想到的就是絲。四川是中國三大蠶業區之一，每年產額，約達一千五六百萬關平兩左右，輸出旺盛時，每年也有一千一二百萬關平兩的數值；但是近年來因為苛捐雜稅的繁擾，天災兵燹的摧殘，洋絲的競爭，世界不景氣的影響，一落千丈，其參澹頹敗之跡，實令人不堪言談。我們只要看一看下面的數字就可以知道。</p>
<p>最近十年來四川出口生絲量值表（註六）數量（擔）價值（關平兩）年份</p>
<p>上面的數字，如果我們拿來與近年渝容萬各地絲廠歇業數字相比較，實在是可以令人觸目驚心的。</p>
<p>牛皮與羊皮也是川省出口貨的大宗，其產品皮質堅韌，纖維緻密，深博歐美人士的好評。近年以來，除了同樣遭受天災人禍的打擊外，又因出口商人不顧信用，自絕出路，輸出亦大形减削，不過衰落的程度並不及生絲及其他另外幾種物產劇烈罷了。</p>
<p>四川的藥材，在國內是極為著名的，因其種類甚多，品質良好，行銷國內外，歷來都佔據川省出口貨物的重要位置，近來因為洋藥的競爭，日本的仿製，而人民又因循舊法，不加改良，出產也是大不如前了。還有夏布，烟葉，五倍子以及紙張等，差不多是以同樣的原因，表現驚人的慘落！我們試一讀下表的數字就可以知道。</p>
<p>最近十年來四川出口夏布，烟葉，五倍子，紙張價值表單位萬關平兩（註七）</p>
<p>上表所列，不過代表一般的概况罷了（讀者欲知詳情，請參閱不佞所編“最近四十五年來四川省進出口貿易統計”一書）。總括起來說，近年川省的物產，一般都顯示大大的衰落，而衰落的原因，也不外乎內在的與外在的兩種，這些原因能否消出，是今後一個重大的課題。談到川省產業的發展。這是我們應該深深注意的。</p>
<p>在川省一般物產皆顯衰落的情境中，惟有桐油與豬鬃二者尚保持獨異的趨勢，這是目前國際市塲特殊的需要所造成的、對於這兩種物產的現狀，固然值得我們慶幸；而對於這兩種物產的將來，我們不能不以更大的努力相期許。</p>
<p>㊂再來談談交通與建設</p>
<p>川省實施新政兩年來的成績，在肅清匪患改革吏治上或許見到了一點成效，减輕負担只是一句空話，那麼唯一較大的成績，或許要算交通與經濟上的建設吧。成渝鐵路由籌備到動工，是在一種突飛猛晋的進展中；這條鐵路的完成，在川省政治經濟以及文化上的意義都很重大，我們預祝它能够順利的成功。</p>
<p>幾年來川省公路建設的進展，也是值得記述的事情。三千七百六十三公里的公路，已在短短的幾年中完成了；一千二百公里的新路綫，也在迅速的開築中。這數千公里公路的完成，一方固然解决了川省交通問題的一部，一方也是川省人民的一篇血淚史。</p>
<p>川省公路的修築，在前防區制時代，路費籌措多由當局勒派或田賦附加，系統既極紊亂，糜費亦十分巨大，而所得效果則至為微小。二十三年政府宣佈義務徵工的命令，以後多半採也這種辦法。義務徵工，政府不給任何代價；被征民工，非但須自備糧食舖蓋，且須携帶築路用具，如鋤頭，土箕，扁担，繩索之類。這種辦法在理論上或許有它的長處，如果不能適宜的應用，它的流弊也實在令人難於想象，久經浩刦，貧苦無依的人民，以樹皮，泥土，草根，糠屑為食而應國家的工役，我們讀到某教育家視察川省征工築路的目擊記，想見那一羣白髪穉子忍着饑餓輾轉於塵土中的情形，為了人道，也不該無動於中罷！</p>
<p>省政府當局對於開發川省物產的工作，兩年來是在積極的進行中。有計劃的具體調整方案。經由“專家”的案頭推廣到廣漠的鄉野去了。尤其是推廣農業的工作，似乎更能引起人們的注意。據建設廠的報告，關於農業推廣方面的成績，大約有以下諸種。</p>
<p>稻麥為川中主要的農作物，產量甚有可觀，近年以天災人禍的影響，川產遂難以自給。建廳對於稻麥生產的改良計劃，首先着重全省產額與消費量的調查，其次就從事品種的改良與災害的防止。去年建廳與四川大學農學院合組四川稻麥試騐塲（現更名改進所），企圖以穫得之優良品種推廣於各區，成績如何，還未可料定。</p>
<p>蔗糖也是四川的特產，但是因為製造不精，品質不良，過去在外銷方面不能有特別的發展。建廳有鑒於此，乃於今年夏間由滬運回爪哇蔗種六千多斤，在內江設立甘蔗試騐塲，並擬於本年度創設年產一萬餘噸之製糖廠於內江，使與推廣改良蔗種二年後之產量相適應，預備於五年內完成每年十萬噸之精糖生產計劃。</p>
<p>川絲的狀况在上章，我們已經講過了，政府鑒於過去絲業的慘敗，乃有蠶絲管理局的成立，企圖以統制的方式完成蠶絲復興的計劃。前在南充設有蠶商改良塲，發佈出來改良的繭種據聞已有很好的效果。現在官商合辦的生絲貿易公司也在重慶成立了，那麼將來對於川絲運銷的問題大約也可以得到解决。</p>
<p>川東的桐油是近年來我國國際貿易商品中的寵兒，最近植物油料廳的成立，於將來改良榨製，推廣運銷上定然也有很大的帮助。</p>
<p>此外如棉作試騐塲的籌設，家畜保育所的創辦，苗圃的推廣，林地的調查等……說來都已在積極的推進中，對於農業生產的重視，我們不能不說當局已在盡着他們最大的努力。</p>
<p>在目前川省生產建設極濃厚的空氣中，我們感覺得有三個極嚴重的問題：第一是人材及技術的問題，二是開發產業前提的一種；年來省府對於專門人材的羅致，據聞已不在少數，其中當然也不少各業的專才。專家在事業中的地位，往往具有超然的性質，而其所享受的報酬也特別豐厚；名實相符的專家固然能够使事業發展，反之往往也能够成為事業的阻礙。因循貽誤，虛靡公帑，都是常見的事實。帮助川省建設的專家們，我們希望沒有這種事實，但我們不能够保證沒有這種事實。除了專家的難得外，幹部訓練也是一個不小的難題。當局似乎不缺少對於這方面努力的表示，在許多困難的前提下，它的成效我們却不敢輕於信任。</p>
<p>其次是經費的問題。財政預算中建設費的常年開支是很微末的，唯一的籌措方法是募債。最近省府呈准中央發行建債二千萬元，這在歷來以公債兌換內戰軍火的四川，不能不說是一樁差可告慰的事情。但是公債的發行是有相當負担，也有相當限制的。如果不在歲出門中謀取適當的支配，顯見這也不是一種永久的辦法。</p>
<p>第三是制度的問題。目前當局推動的事業，顯然有趨重農業的傾向。開發川省產業，應該趨重於工業呢？還是應該趨重於農業呢？抑或二者並重呢？如果二者並重，又該誰先誰後呢？這是值得研究的問題，也是亟需决擇的問題。對於產業經營的方式（或制度），也應該要求較具體的計劃。目前政府所取的方策，很類乎統制經濟的形式。那麼對於這一種制度應該考慮的問題，最先就應該有澈底的解决，也應有顯明的提示，才能獲得重心，才能集中努力的目標！</p>
<p>經濟建設應該是發動於整個的大衆，不單是政府的事，也不是某個人的事；個人的劬勞所能供獻的範圍至小，政府的提倡也難免墮入於“官樣文章”。講到川省的經濟建設，如果我們放開眼界看看四川人民大衆的生活，我們應該知道關鍵是在什麼地方吧。</p>
<p>㊃極目悽慘的災荒</p>
<p>在舉國同慶豐收的去年，多災多難的四川，却遭遇了空前的災荒。這次的災荒眞是空前的幅域來得廣大，就是它的種類，它的程度，也是十分可怕與驚人！</p>
<p>廿五年川省的旱災，全川東西南北各縣沒有不是同樣的嚴重，省府所接到報災的文電，報紙所見的災害新聞，幾乎是雪片一樣的飛來，充斥吾人的耳目。六月的時候，各地米價已由每斗二元餘飛漲到四元的高價，雖有政府平市的救濟，但是所收的效果還是很微小。</p>
<p>夏季大旱，秋收絕望，已經是難堪的慘况了！熟知“天不厭禍”接着又來了毒辣的“秋乾”，剝奪去人民的一綫生機。九月的時候，作者在川東的鄉村作客，見到了赤地千重的慘况，聽着一個老農對我說到春荒的危機，使人不能不為七千萬人民的土地戰慄。災荒的直接產物是“綠色恐怖”，現在全川稍涉偏僻的地方，都已造成了很大的威脅；而且這種威力也不只是在偏僻的地方發展的。</p>
<p>旱災的毒燄還在燃燒，接着又有水災的報警，眞是所謂“禍不單行”，全川嘉陵，岷江，沱江，涪江四水的流域，都遭到洪水的泛濫，被災地區達數十縣之多，人口田物的損失更不可以數計。</p>
<p>現在因為統計的缺乏，我們暫時還不能夠供給這次災荒一個較具體的數字，不過據一般的觀察，歷史上近十數年來還沒有過這樣劇烈的災害。現正在籌劃救濟的辦法，然而“杯水車薪”，是否能够收到多大的效果，誰也不敢斷定。</p>
<p>總括以上各方面的觀察，我們知道：川民的負担，還是沒有减輕；川省的財政，尚且沒有辦法。經濟建設，雖有相當的計劃，而民窮財盡，巧婦也難為無米之炊。更嚴重的是現時的災荒及其散播下的危險的種子。我們對於川省的前途，雖然未必如此的悲觀，而目前的困難，却也是不可掩飾的事實。將來發展如何，則全在乎政府與人民的共同努力了。</p>

<h3>美國景氣與生絲消費之檢討（二）</h3>
<p>— 王天宇</p>
<p>三、景氣下的一般纖維消費</p>
<p>美國的經濟景氣上昇，不用說是人民的購買力的增加，據國際聯盟月報所載，美國的消費指數，以一九一九年為一○○時，則一九三二年為最低，僅七五•九，以後逐年上昇，計一九三三年為八四•二，一九三四年為八三•四，一九三五年達八七•六；一九三六年更漲，計一月為九一•六，至七月已達九五•二。此種消費的景氣，作為服用類的紡織纖維，當然不會例外　Analyst上刊載的纖維消費指數，一九三六年一月，已超過平均年的數額；至八月中，竟上漲四分之一，參觀下表：</p>
<p>美國纖維消費指數（以平均年為一○○）一九三六年</p>
<p>上表明顯地指示着生絲的消費動向，和其他纖維發生異致：尤其和從外觀上與生絲有相當類似目時常互相代用的人造絲比較，更有不同的趨向。由此可知近年來美國的消費指數恢復，於生絲的消費，實際上不示何等良好的影響。我們如果再根據美國全國織物業聯合會的調查，從一九二九年的經濟恐慌發生以後的消費數量之趨勢來看，當更能明白瞭解：</p>
<p>美國生絲消費統計（單位包）（註）：普通年度自一月至十一月，事業年度自七月至翌年六月。</p>
<p>根據上表，可見生絲數量的消費，並無多大的回復可言。由普通年度觀之，去年勉強超過一九三三年的水準；但比之前五六年，差不得還差十萬擔左右。但如從事業年度觀察時，差不多逐年遞减；這，也是不可不特別加以注意的一點。再進一步說：根據普通年度，生絲的消費數量，在前年雖然顯示着增進；可是對總消費纖維言時，實同樣表示减退的趨勢。據美國的“織物雜誌”（Textile　Organ）所載，則生絲消費數量的比率，在一九三○年為總纖維的二•二％，一九三二年為二•四％，一九三四年减退至一•九％，一九三五年僅佔一•八％。其中直綫的上昇者，僅人造絲一種；至一九三五年為止，已佔全額的七•二％；對一九三四年的則增加二九％，生絲僅增七％左右。</p>
<p>四、生絲消費之分析</p>
<p>去年美國的景氣，雖有進一層的上昇，可是對於生絲數量的消費，在去年十個月中，比之前年同期，反有五萬三千包的减少，每月平均减少五千餘包。其中除八九兩月，超過前年數百包以外；减少最多的，首推二月，幾達一萬包。最少的六月，也有二千三百包左右。可見許多人立論的悲觀，並非無因。茲據蠶絲統計月刊所載數字，將去年美國生絲消費數量與前年同期比較如下，藉示一斑：</p>
<p>美國生絲消費數量的比較（有▲者减少）增减</p>
<p>註：單位包，一包相當於一擔，</p>
<p>根據上表，可見美國生絲消費數量的减退，十個月平均約减退一二•五％左右，而减少率最高者，幾及四分之一。又按照此十個月的總數推測，去年全年的消費，恐不上四十五萬擔，對最盛期的六十萬擔，卽有二五％以上的激减，為經濟恐慌發生以來破天荒的現象，在這個美國景氣回復的關頭，生絲的消費，竟有出乎意料的减少，這是非常值得驚奇的事。（未完）</p>

<h3>讀三中全會宣言後</h3>
<p>— 履冰</p>
<p>三中全會於二月二十三日閉幕，我人讀宣言，覺其體察現在之情勢，决定將來之趨向，考慮周詳，無微不至，允為適應我國環境最妥善之方針。</p>
<p>在此宣言中，對外對內，各有闡述，對外求共存，對內求自立，而自立之道，首在全國和平統一：“…和平統一之目的，在集中整個國家整個民族之力量，以排除當前之困難，且進一步以踏入民權主義之大道，明乎整個國家之義，則必知統治權之不可分，尤其軍事外交財政交通諸犖犖大端，有關於國防之需要者，不可不由中央總攬其成，否則部分獨立適成為劣等之有機體，終無所逃於國際之淘汰…”旨哉言乎，此固匪獨大會之决議，且亦為國民心理所盡同者也。</p>
<p>我人應知自民元以來，國內擾攘，國難日深，其癥結所在，厥為全國之不統一，不和平，一切軍事外交財政交通，諸端分崩離析，不受中央之統治。卽就交通方面之電信事業而論，過去時間，因全國不能和平統一，所受影響，亦殊不淺。整個電信，本屬中央統治之下，但一遇變亂，綫路則備遭破壞，機械亦多數損失，而部分獨立之結果，關乎電信之用人行政，中央亦無法指揮，無法稽核，此外如不遵政府明令，任意濫發　電，積欠報費，皆足予電信事業以重大打擊，致計畫無從進行，維持極感艱困，凡斯種種，隱痛實深，是故欲謀電信事業之發展，非全國統一和平不可，必也全國統一和平，在中央統治之下，一切用人行政，均受中央之管轄，發電付費，均依章則之規定，庶幾前途清明，電政有繁榮之希望。</p>
<p>此次三中全會，所昭示國人者，既如上述，全國上下，其願我國之成為劣等有機禮以受國際之淘汰乎？請三復思之！</p>
<h3>電局繼辦寄還電報收據辦法</h3>
<p>— 敬文</p>
<p>各地電報局自二十五年十二月一日起試辦寄還電報收據辦法以來，對於公衆確有相當便利，惟因試辦迄今僅三個月，為時不久，一般收發電報之公衆，未知利用該項辦法者尚不乏其人，以致未能普遍推行。茲聞電局對於此項便利民衆之新業務辦法，已决定自本年三月一日繼續試辦六個月，以覘成效。爰將該項辦法之優點再略述如下：</p>
<p>㊀手續簡便　發報人至電局交發電報後，如欲對方電局於電報送妥後取得曾經收報人簽名蓋章並填註收到電報時刻乞收據寄還本人者，僅須於去報紙（可向電局索取）“納費標識”格內（如用自備紙張者，卽在電報之首端）書明“回據”二字。例如“—回據—南京珠江路上海銀行”，如係洋文電報，則書明Rpcp一字，作為標識，該項標詞，不論用華文或洋文書寫，一律按一字計費，以昭公允，此外發報人祇須預付郵資九分（卽印刷品單掛號之郵資，卽可照辦，手續異常簡便。</p>
<p>㊁用途廣大　電局寄還之“收到電報回據”既經收報人簽名蓋章，不論在法律或會計方面，均可認為收到電報之證據。發報人如將該項回據妥為保存或作為單據黏附帳冊，均為一種有力之證明文件。又各商號或個人拍發關於匯欵帳目•法律•契約等事項之要電後，無不期望對方立卽復電，以資證明。倘發報人採用上項“回據”辦法，在電報首端加註“回據”標識並預付郵資九分者，該項電報由收報人簽收後，收報電局應將曾經收報人簽名蓋章之一收到電報回據，寄至原發報電局查明發報人住址，派差送還發報人，則發報人接到該項回據後，卽可證明本人所發之電報，業已送妥，無須等待對方復電，一紙回據之功用，實無異於收報人之回電。故一般發報人拍發有關契約•法律•帳目•匯欵等重要事項之電報，均宜採用“回據”辦法，俾可取得曾經收報人簽名蓋章之收據，以資存證。萬一將來發生糾紛，該項“收到電報回據”足為有力證據，其用途之廣大，逈非意料所及也。</p>
<p>㊂費用節省　發報人拍發加註“回據”標識之電報，除照付納費標識一字之報費外，祇須預付郵費九分，費用甚省。且發報人同時如有發往同一城市之電報二份或數份欲採用“回據”辦法者，除每份電報均須書明“回據”或Rpcp納費標識照付一字報費外，僅須預付郵資一份，分送電報亦同。惟分送電報如欲採用“回據”辦法者，應由發報人於各個收報人住址名稱之前分別書明上項納費標識，例如“—分送—唱據—上海愚園路（六○八”弄（七五）號文仲英—回據—霞飛路（二八五）號許劍青”，否則電局僅向冠有“回據”標識之收報人取具收據寄還發報局送交發報人。上項收費辦法，對於發報人，亦可節省若干郵費。可見電局最近實施之新業務辦法，莫不以增進通信便利，减輕收發報人之負擔為原則也。</p>
<p>㊃穩妥可靠　吾人郵寄重要函件，如欲由郵局將收信人簽名蓋章之回執寄還者，無不採用雙掛號辦法。電局此次繼續試辦之寄還收據辦法，其性質與郵局之雙掛號辦法相同，僅須於電報報費之外加付郵資九分，卽可獲得收報人簽名蓋章之“收到電報回據”一份或數份，異常經濟而穩妥可靠。一般發報人所發有關契約•法律•帳目•匯欵等事項之電報，當較函件更為重要，亦宜仿照郵寄雙掛號信辦法，在電報首端或去報紙之“納費標識”格內，加註“回據”標識，以便電局要將曾經收報人簽字蓋章之“回據”寄還存證。故此項註有“回據”標識之電報，其功效實與郵局之雙掛號辦法無異，凡拍發重要電報之發報人，似宜儘量採用，以昭鄭重，而資穩妥。</p>
<h3>國內長途電話掛號辦法述要</h3>
<p>— 木公</p>
<p>自今日起施行</p>
<p>按電報掛號章程，電報之收報人得擇定一字—不論中文或英文—向電局聲請掛號後，所有收報人姓名住址，准用該項字樣，作為代替，殊為便利。交通部為使國內長途電話受話人避免接受長途電話時因姓名住址發生錯誤致礙通話起見，援照電報掛號章程之辦法，准受話人得以其姓名住址聲請掛號，並於二十六年一月十四日公布“國內長途電話受話人姓名住址掛號辦法”十三欵，自本年三月一日起施行，社會人士，不可不予以注意也。</p>
<p>上項聲請掛號者，應向所在地交通部所屬辦理長途電話業務之當地電局，填具聲請書，經電局核准後，由電局指定號碼一個代替受話人之姓名住址，並發給掛號憑證，卽由受話人，將此項號碼，通知有關之發話人。發話人發話時，得照下例辦理之：</p>
<p>（受話）（地名）（掛號號碼）（通話種類）（發話人電話號碼及姓名）</p>
<p>例一：南京—掛號三一五—尋常呼呌—二二六三三李文秀（向電局呼呌者用之）</p>
<p>（通話種類）（受話）（地名）（掛號號碼）（發話人姓名住址）</p>
<p>例二：加急傳呼—天津—掛號二五八—上海霞飛路一○七號劉子安（向零售處填明者用之）</p>
<p>按該項辦法第六欵之規定：“掛號有效期間，均自發給掛號憑證之日起，至該年份終了之日為止、”又同辦法第十一欵之規定：“電局辦理掛號及發給換給憑證，均不收任何費用。”此為較電報掛號章程優越之點。蓋甲乙兩種電報掛號之有效期間，均自掛號之月一日起算，丙種電報掛號之有效期間，自掛號之日起計算，而長途電話受話人姓名住址掛號辦法之掛號有效期間，無論何時掛號，均自發給掛號憑證之日起，至該年份終了之日為止。換言之：此項掛號，以年份計算，而不以月份計算是也。又電報掛號之掛號費，有二十五元，十元，一元之甲、乙、丙三類，而此項掛號，不分種類，不收任何費用。換言之：凡長途電話用戶願使用此項辦法者，電局以無條件為其服務是也。</p>
<p>至此項掛號期滿後，如發話人仍用該號號碼傳發長途電話時，受話電局，得予試傳一次，並通知受話人繼續掛號，如不照辦者，嗣後卽停止傳呼。此於推廣業務之中，仍示優待之意。</p>
<h3>上海與重要各地聯絡之長途電話</h3>
<p>— 宣</p>
<p>上海為全國商業之中心，交通部全國長途電話之建設計劃，卽規定上海為中心點之一。自九省長途電話工程建設竣工後，上海一地，陸續開放通話局所，達二百餘處之多，將來各處增音站建設完成，全國各處，均可與上海通話，由國際電台之接轉，進而開放與世界通商大埠通話，晤千里於一堂，决疑問於海頃，我國現代化之精神，置於國際電信之林，將無遜色，誠盛事也。茲將上俄至重要各地通話價目，列表如左，以供參考：</p>
<p>以上所列，僅以重要城市為限，因其通話地點過多，不及備載。請向本埠電話局或長途電話零售處詢問，當有滿意之答復。至通話手續如下：㊀如裝有電話者，先呌電話局長途台，告知自己電話號數，受話人所在地，及其姓名住址或電話號數，俟長途台紀錄完畢後，將聽筒掛上靜候通話。㊁未裝電話而欲使用長途電話者，請至電話局或電報局附設之長途電話零售處或公用電話處掛號，預繳一次通話費，取得收據後，卽可在該處照掛號之數依次通話。</p>
<h3>滬吳載波電話暢通</h3>
<p>上海蘇州間載波電話，自上月裝竣試話，并於二月一日正式開放，使用以來，因電波提高關係，音浪非常清晰，民衆殊感便利，玆探得是項載波機件，係德國西門子廠製造，分裝於上海電話局，閘北分局，及蘇州電報局內，為MK式，專供距離較短之長途明綫，如六十至百公里之用，得由頻率八十至百四十千周波傳遞話務，在此對明綫上，可增加通話回綫至五個之多，機件小巧，裝置簡便，調整容易，故經濟業務，兩有裨益，聞交通部對於京滬等繁忙，綫路亦將分別加裝相當之載波機件，以使話務暢達，而减少等候時間云。</p>
<p>福建區建甌至南平電話綫完成，已於一月二十四日開放與福州等六處通話。其通話價目三分鐘制，計建甌至南平三角，水口五角，福州八角，尤溪五角，古田四角，閩清六角云。</p>
<p>春秋</p>
<h3>春之散絃</h3>
<p>— 成軒</p>
<p>莫辜負這良辰美景啦！雖說“春秋多佳日”，然“秋”終不如“春”哩！靜穆的四野裏：花兒無聲地展開着它的笑靨：樹木們再也耐不住地綻出着它的嫩芽，萬紫千紅，說不盡的嬌艷！深青嫩綠，繪不盡的圖案；及時行樂呀！去欣賞那大自然的美麗！那裏有你所欲知的眞知識，眞學問的一切！古人說：“秉燭夜遊”，眞是“良有以也”哩！</p>
<p>諺云：“春宵一刻值千金”呀！“逝者如斯夫，不舍盡夜”，春宵一刻如此，春日一刻該倍蓰于它啦！“春眠不覺曉”的都市生活裏的人們呀！你們該思量一下春日的如何可貴呀！</p>
<p>一年之計在於“春”又是“春為歲首”值此國難日深的時候，我們應如何努力，打量啦！我們該如何像“春”一般的朝氣蓬勃啦！</p>
<p>“春到貧家不當春”，在這年頭，讀到了這句姚春木的詩句，眞有點說不出的痛心啦！詩人們大都好理想，求將來，像這樣淡淡地一句寫實，從前已如此，移到現在，又何嘗不如此呢！</p>
<h3>書生</h3>
<p>— 花病鶴</p>
<p>書生，這年頭兒，是不中用了：大學生拖黃包車，固然值得詫異，然而能够自食其力，未始不是佳事，像遜清末葉，還抱着“宰相須用讀書人”的思想，竟弄出許多笑話，纔是糟糕呢。</p>
<p>鄭孝胥在粵西做邊防大臣的時候，很以戎馬書生自豪，可是那時盜賊橫行，幾乎民不聊生，他却自以為豐功偉績，謳詠千秋，竟立碑勒詩，幹着自拉自唱自恭維的勾當，因此給兩廣總督岑春煊，劾了一狀，並且罵他是畫餅名士，可憐這位自命戎馬書生的邊防大臣，本想媲美燕然勒銘，峴山墮淚故事的，結果却遭到畫餅名士的譏諷，您道可憐不可憐？</p>
<p>最有趣的，中東一役，有一位姓吳的湖南巡撫，因為得了一方度遼將軍的古印，他大喜過望，以為這一定是立功遼東，萬里封侯的朕兆，因此立刻飛章入奏，請纓出師，豈知臨陣之後，他在營前高掛一塊免死牌，意思是呌敵人解甲投降，免得玉石俱焚，一面却和幾個幕僚，天天吟詩作畫，結果給敵人襲擊，弄得全軍覆沒，不可收拾，這個書生，可就傻得大了。</p>
<p>黃仲則有詩說：“百無一用是書生，”這是多麼沉痛的話。</p>
<h3>東北的雪</h3>
<p>— 雪文</p>
<p>自己從小就生在北方，對“雪”有說不出的愛慕，也不知為什麼。</p>
<p>在東北，冬天的時候，你是不會有一刻看不見“雪”的，並不是因為整天價下雪，而是為了天氣冷，“雪”是不會融化的緣故。</p>
<p>我最喜歡夜裏下雪，那末，當你早起外望的時候，滿眼都是皎潔的銀白，一切皆現得是純樸，自然，而且勻和，使人頓時如置身另一境界，蕩滌盡胸中的塵氛俗念了。</p>
<p>假如附近有樹，那末，你會看到枯枝上堆積着的雪層，白皚皚的分外可愛。</p>
<p>這時，每當雪下得停了時，我便穿上皮衣服，高興去走雪地，有時會在鞋跟上凍成了高高的冰塊。脚下支——支——的響，我最喜歡看自己在雪地上所踏落的一個個的脚印、</p>
<p>有時，駕着東北所特有的“爬犁”，在雪地上支撑着玩，那末，迅速，輕捷，軋着雪的轍印，眞個別有雅趣逸致。</p>
<p>如果在外面玩得盡興了的時候，最好是作一作“掃雪”的事。推着木頭的耙子，把雪積成堆堆，那末心裏就會有愉快之感，而且包管你會忙出汗來呢！</p>
<p>假如你有興致的話，好！動手堆“雪人”吧！什麼大肚子佛啊，羅漢啊，隨你的意。堆成了，它便會老老實實的呆在那裏，除非是雪化了</p>
<p>下過雪以後，街道上便都結着層冰，於是便成了孩子們打“滑溜”的場所了。每在蒼茫的暮色裏，各家門口皆蕩漾着孩子們的生意的笑呌！</p>
<p>自從踏上征塵，已竟有許久沒有看見故鄉的“雪”了，然而，我仍如昔日一樣的愛慕着它，什麼時候能回去看一看它的丰姿呢？……</p>
<h3>燈市裏</h3>
<p>— 陳大木</p>
<p>新正是熱鬧的，初頭五天過去，吃了“財神酒”這皆大歡喜的廢曆新年似乎告一段落，可是“上燈圓子落燈麵”，有例在先，元宵閘花燈，便成為一個盛會的“餘興”似的，少不得。否則就大家感到冷落，未能“興盡而散”。十三高燈起，十八落燈止，連頭帶尾也有六天，打鑼鼓，放爆竹，家家戶戶，花燈輝煌，熱鬧情况，較諸新年頭上，有過之，無不及。</p>
<p>孩子時代對這些日子是特別起勁的，瞧見鄰舍人家孩子掮着西瓜燈，拖着兎子燈時，便眼紅心癢，跟爹媽吵鬧個不休，起初媽總是拒絕我的要求：“孩子家不知道錢難掙，買那些廢物何用！”當時那裏懂這些道理，小心兒裏怨悵着，氣得不肯吃飯，終於爹答允下來，領我到城隍廟燈市去揀選，最被自己所愛好的，要算八足兩鰲會活動的蟹燈，和綠毛獅子捧球燈。可是價錢非常貴，每每連走幾個攤子都不能成交，心理祇埋怨着爹的吝嗇，結果僅把便宜而不惹景的蝦蟆燈和荷花燈買了回來，依然感到不很高興。</p>
<p>可是眞像個夢般的，童年的生活已成泡影，雖還有偶然的記憶，沒法子拉得回來，而眼前自己已做了兩個孩子的父親了。我這才明白媽您前所以要拒絕我買燈的理由，也這才瞭解爹從前所以嗇吝地不肯買好燈的苦衷。當我自己被孩子逼着上燈市去，而吵着要買好燈的時候，便覺得孩子們太會胡鬧太不顧做大人的苦處，從並不豐裕的生活費中抽出一部份來去買飢不能當糧，寒不能當衣的燈，這奢侈品，委實有些疼惜呵。</p>
<p>在燈市中，帶着苦惱的心情，大兒子拖住我右衣裳角，小兒子拖住左面的，從這個攤子擠到那個攤子，花燈紥得一年比一年考究精緻。價值亦正和物質成為正比例。兩個多鐘頭未買成一盞合意的，用種種欺騙違心的話安慰着孩子：“你看中這盞大走馬燈嗎，那及得來唐克車燈呢，……可是，乖乖的，爹以為還是飛機燈更好玩，你們知道航空救國嗎，打××鬼子。”然而，孩子們的忍耐工夫並不如我這般好。已洞鑒了我的欺騙似的，非立刻買給各人一盞，就不足以維持自己對他倆的信心。一想起自己童年時代情景，和現已年邁力衰的雙親時，又不禁使自己對生活低下頭來。在這熱鬧的燈市裏。</p>
<h3>換巢鳳凰</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回（絮語感慈幃懺情殉孝秋光黯翠黛景觸書懷）</p>
<p>夢蘭道：我現在是兩條路。一條是死，一條是聽父母之命，一條是……這一條是不必談了。二嫂，你知道我是相信宗教的。宗教對於一個人自殺，那是天地間的罪人。無論如何，我是不自殺的。至於父母之命，唉，我眞不能說……說着又搖了幾搖頭。二少奶道：既是這兩條路都走不通。那末，就是走第三條路了。這第三條路，到底是怎麼一條路呢？你索興告訴告訴我，我們反正是閑談，要什麼緊夢蘭道：唉！第三條路，那還用得着問嗎？算是我完全降伏了，一切依着老人家去辦。二少奶又起身倒了一杯茶慢慢的呷着，在呷茶的時候，眼睛由杯子口上，射到夢蘭臉上去好幾次。把那杯茶呷完了，這就放下杯子來，向他笑道：妹妹是個新人物，可是很講舊道德。夢蘭道：我是個新人物？說着微微一笑。二少奶笑道：怎麼着？你還不承認是個新人物嗎？夢蘭道：我假如是個新人物，我就不會弄得現在這樣子顛顛倒倒了，你看我那裏像一個新人物？二少奶點點頭道：我雖然不認識多少字，但是我也常聽到你二哥對我說過。青年生在現在的時代，或者是新也好，或者是舊也好。唯有這思想新不新舊不舊的人，最是苦惱不過。因為什麼呢？因為自己既然知道思想要新，可是儘管向新的路上走，家庭也好，社會也好，全不免格格不入。說的話，人家不愛聽。作的事，人家不愛看，甚至自己讀的書，人家也說要不得。若是拋開新的，專向舊的路上走罷，年紀輕輕的人，讓人家說上一句老腐敗，心裏也委實不甘。這就弄得新也不好，舊也不好，兩頭不着實。妹妹你說我這句話，對是不對？夢蘭笑道：你的話對極了。不想你一個家裏當少奶奶的人，倒懂得青年人許多痛苦。二少奶笑道：這就叫是到老，學到老了。你二哥喜歡議論這些，我常在一旁聽的多了，多少懂得一些。其實我所懂的，也就說出來了。我不曾說過的，大概我就不懂。你說我的知識不是很有限嗎？（一三八）</p>

<h3>圖案的舊劇方式</h3>
<p>— 張皇</p>
<p>在舊劇裏，無論說白，唱詞，做工，檯步，塲面，以及行頭扮相，莫不有一定的規矩，一定的關聯，在恰當的時間有勢所必然的表現。稍為熟悉一點舊劇情形的人可以頂想得到也可試為編制支配無不適應的。我承認這些—舊劇裏的一切—是合於圖案方式的。刻板，準確，呼應，都是舊劇的精神，要那伶人們下着多少年頭的苦功習練，纔有成就名角之望。一個伶人造詣的深淺，除了要瞧他能否適合劇藝的定例或規程外，也有各個人天才高低之分。那正似圖案畫作者也有結構的精粗，單獨的敏拙，可以供人辨別和批判的。外國人的欣賞中國舊劇，原是以唯美的眼光為出發點的啊。</p>
<h3>墨猴</h3>
<p>— 陳天賜</p>
<p>東三省的吉林，誰都知道有貂皮，人參，烏拉草三寶，然而東三省的松林間，尚有一種活寶，却不為人們所熟悉，那便是墨猴。</p>
<p>墨猴長僅三寸餘，皮毛為紫色，眼睛為金黃色，而尾短，每隻代價，約值五百金，得之者大多纂養於象牙筆筒內，鎖以極細的金練條，食松台石榴子。墨猴的以墨名，因它性嗜香墨，每磨墨作畫，如有餘漿，卽舐而食之。</p>
<p>台灣的深山中，亦有一種小猴，長約四寸餘，紅睛，毛純黑，性亦喜吃墨，並喜食甘蔗，棒子，及名種果仁。聞此種猴，係產於右灣近海的山峽中，如果有船隻經過其下，卽羣集出觀，然它們極機警乖巧，且矯捷善避，故得之很難，市上很少見到。</p>

<h3>宜興之陶業</h3>
<p>— 吳百朋</p>
<p>向負盛名之宜興陶業，凡宇內海外喜考古而博雅者，莫不視為珍奇之品，近幾年來，陶器店之風起雲湧，出產貨物之暢銷無阻，在在皆足以證實筆者之筆，並非嚮壁虛造。</p>
<p>陶土原產在吾宜之蜀山鎮，相傳為越大夫范蠡，來居蠡墅，創造是物。位居在城之東南隅，所產之紫砂陶土，光澤不一，有紅如荼火，有灰暗青黃，為他邑之所無，而吾宜唯之獨產。</p>
<p>出產物，以日用及陳列品居多，如茶壺，茶杯，花盆，水硯，紅，甕，瓶，罐，等，花色繁多，琳瑯滿目。近年來，工業進步，不論人物，飛禽，走獸，將土色分配，酷似物狀，維妙維肖，眞傑作也。</p>
<p>製法：大別之分製坯，修坯，雕刻，上油，施彩五大類，然皆賴於人工，今仍墨守陳法，未見盡善盡美，加以製法之繁複，出貨之遲鈍，尤為出產上遭一絕大影響。</p>
<p>邇來，政府鑒於斯業欲求改良起見，特設一省立陶業學校，於蜀山附近，專以培植人才，恊助教導，雖草草數年，而成績卓著，不得不目為陶業復興之好現象。</p>
<p>陶器為創辦最老，出品最精者，莫如吳鼎盛，該店開設於城內中正街，店主吳漢文，年近六旬，而精神矍鑠，平日吃齋誦佛，為吾宜陶業界之大王，餘如義興吳翰記興業等，即少遜矣。</p>
<p>總之，每做一件事，多少總須存一點競爭心，此競爭並不在取價低廉，全在物質精良，試觀目前，在物質上求講究者，能有幾人，大半均急求廉價出售，對物質之精良，製造之加工，全不顧及，此誠彌足令人痛心者也。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>廣播事業之盛衰</h3>
<p>— 家千</p>
<p>廣播事業在中國盛行，還是三五年以來的事。記得最初的幾家播音臺都是“玩票”性質的，卽沒有週波的限止，也沒有各種節目，僅是播送唱片，好像營業廣告也是後來的事。可是就在這種情形之下，對於一種新興的玩意兒聽衆們還是歡迎的，那時候的礦石機和一燈機都賣得起很好的價錢，由於收音機的激增，電臺上因之增加節目，營業廣告，同時國際電信局也限止電臺的週波了。那時候是廣播事業的全盛時期，上海一市播音臺卽有四十餘所之多，每天從清晨七八時迄深夜四時，收音機上沒有停歇的時候，而收音機的入口也給了我們一個驚人的數目。</p>
<p>可是從去年度起，這新興事業受了各業不景氣的影響，也漸趨衰敗之途了。又因為播音從事員的份子複雜，電信局又限止十種節目在下午六時至十時不準播送，這更給了播音業及播音從業員一重打擊。</p>
<p>最近電信局又限令同樂，周協記等八電臺停止播音。“該各臺等僉以卽根據交通部民營電臺之條例，呈請許可後設立，卽為合法之民營事業，若並未有違條例之處，依法應受政府保護，前於二月四日聲述理由，再呈請交部收回成命，並頒佈民營電臺設備標準，乃未蒙批示，故於昨日（二十七日）將全體民營廣播電臺停止播音一天，推派代表赴京請願。”</p>
<p>請願的結果如何，最近日內想來總有下文，現在不必妄加猜測。不過據筆者知道，交通部最近有通令各電臺對於節目之分配，教育十之六，娛樂十之四，以純娛樂的播音事業來輔助教育，自然是可喜的現象，貿易局的報告，把收音機入口數目與香粉等消耗品列入一欄，純娛樂的播音事業卽使再恢復到從前的全盛時期，對之恐怕也有愧色吧。</p>
<p>在歐美，日本，最顯著的是蘇聯，播音臺不僅是宣揚教育學術的利器，更是軍事上的重要工具，而我們把無數的金錢化在“私訂終身後花園”及“活捉張三郎”聲中，自然有整頓之必要，最先着手增加教育節目也是很對的。不過我們也得從另一方面來看看購置收音機的對象，他們會不會放棄了絃子琵琶而像做小學生似的在收音機旁上課，卽使電臺上百分之百播送了教育節目，恐怕這十萬餘具收音機，都要束之高閣，他們相趨上東方書塲去了。</p>
<p>聽衆的購置收音機卽以娛樂節目為要旨，我們就應該從“寓教育於娛樂”入手，無論滑稽，彈詞，及一切娛樂節目都繩以目標，現在各種娛樂節目的劇本不是都要社會局審查後才許播送，從這裏入手，或許可以“事半功倍”，這是筆者供獻的一點愚見，在中國，要利用播音來“普及教育”無論如何是太早了一點。</p>
<h3>曠塲上</h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>在都市裏找尋生活的人，想呼吸點新鮮空氣，正如在沙漠中求水潭。當初被我發現這所新居時，是感到多麼欣慰呵，雖然這間破舊的樓面有些像年久失修的古廟，已呈朽腐的椽樑，斑剝的粉磚牆，每每予人以不快。而我愛好的，却是那靠南向的四扇明瓦窗，和窗外的一塊曠塲，一株棗樹傍着樓挺秀地站着，蒼勁的椏枝直伸上窗口來，夏天葉茂時，做了小樓的自然的窗帘，早上小雀子在枝上鼓着如簧之⾆，唱出美麗的歌曲，於是我打床上跳起來，享受植物養氣的調節。秋風一起，在樓窗口略伸手便可摘到棗子吃。這曠塲和棗樹雖不是我的祖產，可是我確已無條件的做了它們暫時的主人。</p>
<p>我是多麼幸福的享受者呵，一個沙漠的旅者找到了甘泉。</p>
<p>然而受難的日子是有的，冬天和春天便是這些日子的來臨。除掉雨雪天，冬天的太陽在這曠塲上是特別的好，正因為太陽好，把附近矮屋裏的一些老太婆，娘兒，和孩子們都吸引來了。她們和他們來享受自然所賦予的溫暖，甚至連繩索作塲裏的工人亦把笨重的木架搬來曠塲絞繩索了。禁止不住的孩子們的撒野和打架，工人和娘兒有意無意的調笑，老太婆的嚕哩嚕囌的斥罵，一種喧囂和噪雜，攪亂了我的思緒，關上窗子亦沒用，想落筆寫些東西，每會被一種哄然的哭笑聲，或鬧罵聲打擊着。有時我委實被吵得非常憤怒，離開椅桌預備推開窗子對曠塲上的人衆下一審警告或責斥，可是立刻又把此意打消。我憑什麼資格去干涉她們和他們在生活上的享受的自由呢？又豈能為我一己的貪圖安靜，而禁止衆人的天性的發洩？</p>
<p>這樣我又耐心地坐了下來，扔下了憤怒，自己訓誡着自己：我應當磨鍊成為羣衆而犧牲個人享受的精神呵。</p>
<p>一個冬天便這樣的被磨鍊過來了。新春的曠塲上却加倍的熱鬧，每天都有緊一陣，使我的心震蕩起來。在這些粗獷的樂器聲響中，聽來似乎還充溢着生活的呼號：“喂，要錢不要命。喂，要錢不要命！”好幾次，我真覺得駭怕地掩住了耳朵。今日之下眞有以性命搏取生活的嗎？這疑惑剛從腦海泛起，理智立刻從旁邊給了回答︰怎麼沒有，而且正多着呢，假使你肯細細查究一下社會，那裏不正在搬演着“要錢不要命”呌人寒心的生活之悲劇呢！我立刻明白了：從窗外的曠塲上就可以看到整個社會的雛形。</p>
<p>今天曠塲上又來了做猴戲的人，除主角猴子之外，還有一頭羊和一頭哈拜狗。我亦做着觀衆中的一員，起先猴子，羊，哈拜狗都被扣在那株棗樹桿上，這調劑我生活環境的棗樹想不到此刻成為牠們的桎梏。做猴戲的人打開木箱，取出許多衣冠和臉具，一手執皮鞭，猴子便在皮鞭的導演下，穿戴起衣冠和臉具，騎在羊背上，裝着人態做把戲，最後輪到哈拜狗了，向觀衆跪着作求乞狀，於是那人喊：“給錢哪，給錢哪！”畜生那肯做把戲呢？牠們無非受了皮鞭的</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>脅迫，沒有法子。最可憐的還是那頭馴和的羊，做了奴隸的奴隸。</p>
<p>從此，我對於明瓦窗外的那塊曠塲，另有了更深切的認識。</p>
<h3>一幕慘劇的寫實</h3>
<p>— 南鷗</p>
<p>天剛發亮，礦區工人住宅就開始有人爬起身，嗆咳着，不經意地吐痰，以及有聽不清的說話聲音，傳送到外邊來。天氣近許久來眞有點古怪，儘是下雨，泥土全濕了，鬆了，老工人沈貴望着陰雨綿綿的天，有一次這樣地呌道：</p>
<p>“眞是天年都改變啦！我在這裏足十五年了，從不曾碰到這樣的天氣”！</p>
<p>“南洋是不太有雨水的—眞是怪”！別的人聽了沈貴的話，順口這麼應着。</p>
<p>而今天，沈貴起來，第一件可是打從小小的窗口伸出腦袋去望望天，太陽是不是會出來，很難斷定，不過晴是準可以保得住的了。對門底屋頂還是濕膩膩地，簷前還溜下水珠來。這時，年青的古阿二也起身跑出門來了，沈貴一瞧見他那赤着的背，就無着羨慕地向他道：</p>
<p>“阿二，你眞是一匹牛呀！一早就赤了膊出來，也不會生病麼”？</p>
<p>“沈貴叔你早”！阿二笑吟吟地回答着：“我們粗人原是不怕冷的囉”。然後，他回轉屋裏去了。阿二底妻子正為他好洗得十分亁凈的衣裳拿出來，她和阿二結婚才五年，而兒子都快兩歲了。這一對年青的夫妻，在礦區裏，是常常被人羨慕的。現在，阿二照例要上工去了，戴上帽子，提了一盞在礦窟裏用的照明燈，看了還在呼呼睡着的孩子就走出去了。</p>
<p>往礦窟去的路上，古阿二知沈貴他們一道，在灰色的晨霧中走去。老成的沈貴向人們提起礦窟因為雨水太多，沒有平常那麼堅實了，若不小心，恐怕要——他沒有說下去，阿二就拍了拍他底肩，說沈貴太過慮了：為什麼非想到不幸上去不可呢？</p>
<p>就這樣，在礦窟中，阿二快樂的工作着。工頭在一邊巡邏，咤罵着人們，這使窟中的空氣異常煩燥。還有運石的車轆轆地馳過，衝向外面去。從窟口到阿二工作的地方，差不多有半里長，在這裏，全沒有一點陽光，人們呼吸着泥土的氣息，而滿身也塗得十分難看。鐵鋤打在石上，發出叮叮的聲音，若不用燈，那這簡直是一個多麼黑暗的世界啊</p>
<p>工作照例進行……有誰在唱着客家山歌，還有笑聲……人們全像一點掛慮也沒有似地……</p>
<p>可是，猛地裏砰——嘭—一聲巨雷也似的，響聲直震憾了窟中的工人底心膽，一下子窟上底光綫完全沒遮斷了，泥土一大堆緊接着一大堆地陷落下來。人們立卽驚呌起來，沈貴底呌喊尤其來得尖利：</p>
<p>“哎呀！礦窟陷下啦”！</p>
<p>“救命！救—命”！有人被橫木壓得儘嚷着救命，但是像天崩地裂一般陷了下來的礦石，木樑，泥土…壓得每一個人都不知如何是好。</p>
<p>在住宅區奔來的孩子，婦人們，簡直瘋了般，衝了過來。礦警忙着維持秩序，礦主咬着朱力烟，眼睛要冒火似的，打求救的電報。而在一旁的書記却心裏罵着：“草菅人命的傢伙！那個工程師不是前五天就說要想法子保障工人底生命，礦窟不十分牢固了嗎？現在，……太晚了！太晚了”！</p>
<p>太陽也像驚異於人世間出了這麼一件慘事那麼地，探出腦袋來了。而那些不怕炎炎的赤道上的太陽的人們，守候在一起：在礦窟中，那兒有他們底父親，丈夫或是朋友，他們有什麼法子救出那活活埋在地下的人呢？</p>
<p>到第二天中午，救護的車算做了一個段落了，沈貴被救出地面上來時，已經斷氣半個鐘頭以上了。而古阿二，這强壯的，年青的傢伙，總算還留下一條命，送往醫院去治療。這一次雖失了生命的，據說在六十人以上：受傷的就算不清了。</p>
<p>這樣慘劇，在馬來亞半島上的錫礦塲發生已經不止這一次了！不過，這却是很慘的一次！那一年我住在離礦區不遠的××埠，聽了工人生命這樣的沒有保障，深深地憤怒着，正到現在……</p>
<h3>偷馬</h3>
<p>— 柳明</p>
<p>—東北故事之一—</p>
<p>你們諸位是在南方，少有騎馬的機會，其實騎馬倒是最有趣的玩兒，今年我在上海愚園路看見一個跑驢塲，騎驢的人穿着西裝大衣，驢兒又比猪大不了多少，看來全不像個樣子。你們一到北方，就曉得騎馬是一件多麼雄偉的事情，而且滿有趣味的。</p>
<p>我曾經有一個時候，在大隊里當傳達，有時遇到緊急的公事，一天要跑到二百五十里外的地方去，並要在當天晚上趕回來。這當兒，不是好馬是吃不消的。</p>
<p>我為着想找到一匹好馬，不曉得化了多少苦心，大隊長曾把他最喜愛的那匹栗色馬借給我騎，可是那畜牲差後勁，初時拚命的奔跑，後來却踱着緩步，就是鞭打它，它還是走不動。</p>
<p>後來我聽知鄰村里那村長有一匹好馬，這馬我曾經見過，好高的個子，長鼻，緊腹，實在是好東西。從此之後我想盡心計要把它弄到手。</p>
<p>有一天，下着小雪，弟兄們請我喝了兩杯白亁。大家一談，又談着馬身上了。我猛然記起那隻村長的馬來。不想又可，眞奇怪的，那晚上一想到就巴不得把它偸過手來。我想了又想，决計趁今夜無月的時候，把它偸過來。</p>
<p>我跟隊長借了一支手槍，二雙橡皮套鞋，這些都是上年從依蘭附近得到的戰利品。我又喝了兩杯酒，壯壯膽，於是不管什麼，就起身了。</p>
<p>一到鎮外，風捲着雪，松林呼呼地在狂啸着。我心里又熱又急，打了幾鞭，一直往鄰村跑去。</p>
<p>我把馬拴在近村的樹幹上。偸偸地越過村長家的磚牆，那牆只二尺來高，只阻得畜牲，阻不得人的。我偸偸地把籬門開了。天是一片漆黑，籬笆嘶嘶地在風中呌着，就是我扳開籬門有了聲音，鬼也聽不到的。我又把馬廐的木門用手托上來，它馬上脫出門臼。那匹馬已經睡去了。我用白乾往它的鼻口噴了又噴，小聲地把橡皮套鞋套住馬脚，你瞧，我作得那樣小心，就像我把五代都幹偸馬這活似的。</p>
<p>我把它牽了出來，過了棚門，還是沒有半點聲音。一走出鎮外，我便把橡皮套鞋卸下來，幾隻野狗跟着亂吠一塲，但已經沒有人聽見了。</p>
<p>我心里眞是樂得開花。回到松林里，把原馬解開來，於是便朝鎮上跑去。我用過馬足足兩年。現在歸誰騎駛，已不知道了。</p>

<h3>對於「阿比西尼亞」事件讀者二十一人來函</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我們懷着很熱烈的情緒，讀了上海文藝，電影，戲劇，音樂界等一百二十二人反對水兵暴行的宣言。</p>
<p>這一次意水兵用暴力搗毁上海大戲院，毆傷我數十同胞並燒毁我被壓廹民族熱烈愛護的「阿比西尼亞」影片—這樣侮辱我民族國家的事件，可以説又開了强權干涉弱者的新紀錄，他們不僅蔑視我國政府監督電影的主權，並毁壞了我們地方的法權和警權，他們簡直當中國人民都是馴服的奴隸！</p>
<p>所以，我們對於上海文藝界等發表宣言裏，提出：督促政府對意國要求賠償損失，懲罰兇手，道歉並保證以後不再發生同類的事件等幾點，認爲它是足以代表我們全體的民意，我們不論是站在電影觀衆的地位，或是愛國同胞地位，都願意一致起來作政府强硬對外交涉的後盾。</p>
<p>不過我們更殷勤的希望，要全國人士共同起來不要視若無賭，特别是負有發揚輿論的新聞界，更應爲這事交涉的前途，盡一點力！</p>
<p>熱誠地希望你們，能够把　信刋出來</p>

<h3>Shaanxi Politics Gradually on the Right Track</h3>
<p>Sun Weiru to Return to Shaanxi Soon　Zhang's Department Officers Pass Through Hangzhou to Enter Beijing　Wang Shuchang Visits Mo Dehui and Others</p>
<p>(Xi'an) The Shaanxi Provincial Government has been officially reorganized by order of the Executive Yuan. The candidates for chairman, committee members, and department heads have also been appointed separately. In the future, the political promotion of the entire province can gradually be brought onto the right track. It is not difficult to restore the state before December 12 of last year. The provincial government will carefully consider the selection of county magistrates in the future. Regarding the administration of the administrative commissioners of each district, the Executive Yuan has ordered them to directly follow the instructions of the provincial government. Hang Yi, administrative commissioner of the Second District, Cao Guohua, administrative commissioner of the Third District, and Zhong Xiangyu, administrative commissioner of the Fourth District, are currently staying in Xi'an awaiting an audience with Chairman Sun to request instructions on policy guidelines. Fu Wen, administrative commissioner of the First District, Wei Xiru, administrative commissioner of the Fifth District, Zhang Dulun, administrative commissioner of the Sixth District, and Xiong Zhengping, administrative commissioner of the Seventh District, are also scheduled to come to the province soon to meet Chairman Sun for instructions.

<p>(Nanjing) After Sun Weiru arrived in Beijing, he was extremely busy with social engagements. On the afternoon of the 28th, Central Committee member Zhang Ji, Chief of Staff Lü Chao, and Shaanxi alumni of the Beijing Army University, as well as Shaanxi colleagues from the Military Senate, held separate banquets. In the evening, Shaanxi fellow provincials and classmates in Beijing, together with Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai fellow provincials in Beijing, held a joint banquet. It is reported that Sun's visit to Beijing this time is due to the fact that since the Shaanxi Incident, three months of taxes have not been collected. In the past, local finances were extremely difficult, and a considerable amount of funds had already been diverted from local banks. In addition to seeking instructions from President Chiang, he will also discuss remedial measures with Finance Minister Kong in the coming days. Regarding the past financial situation of the province and the budget for local revenue and expenditure in the future, Sun has prepared a list and a summary budget for Kong to review. Once everything is in order, he will return to Shaanxi to preside over affairs. He plans to return to Shaanxi within three or four days. Before returning to Shaanxi, he still needs to go to Shanghai to talk to Song Ziwen, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, regarding financial matters. According to those around Sun, the past financial situation in Shaanxi Province was such that before the cessation of tobacco tax, there was an annual shortfall of more than one million yuan. After the strict prohibition of opium and the cancellation of more than three million yuan in taxes, the shortfall was approximately five million yuan. As for the Shaanxi Incident, there were no other impacts, except that merchants suffered some losses. Currently, the price of each bag of flour is approximately 5.60 or 5.70 yuan, having risen to a maximum of 6.10 yuan. Apart from luxury goods being more expensive, everything else is gradually returning to normal. (Special dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Duo, the superintendent of the customs, reported to the Ministry of Finance that foreign merchants know that the tax rates of this customs are low, so they transport goods through Rehe and Inner Mongolia by truck to this customs, which is a way to avoid heavy taxes and choose lighter ones. However, there is no precedent for refusing to accept foreign goods for customs declaration. How should we audit the foreign goods that continue to come in the future? Please give instructions. Since the goods reported by the customs include foreign goods, in order to prevent problems before they occur, the customs should send personnel to investigate the transportation of foreign goods via other routes and coordinate tax collection measures to prevent malpractices. According to the Chief Inspector of Customs, if Tianjin's efforts to combat smuggling are fully effective, then the importance of this place will also increase. In order to prevent smuggling, we cannot ignore the current situation and make temporary changes. The customs should send personnel to Zhangduoguan to handle the taxation of imported foreign goods, while the customs should be completely managed by Zhangduoguan according to the old rules, so that the customs can fully manage the foreign goods imported through Zhangjiakou.

<h3>HSBC Holds Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>Chairman Praises China's Progress</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) HSBC held its annual meeting on Saturday. Mr. Patterson, the chairman of the bank, presided over the meeting. Mr. Patterson said in his speech that the atmosphere of international trade is still bleak, which is well known. The current prosperity of world commerce is artificially created rather than natural, and many countries lack a genuine basis for the word "prosperity." If we do not quickly find a way to correct certain basic economic factors that the public knows are off track, then the new wave of prosperity will disappear like a deflated balloon. Mr. Patterson then mentioned China and praised President Chiang Kai-shek, the National Government, the Ministry of Railways, and the Customs. He said that in the past year, China has shown brightness everywhere. China's financial and commercial atmosphere has greatly improved compared with the past. Mr. Patterson then talked about the business situation of HSBC last year, saying that after deducting losses and unexpected expenses, the net profit was 15,107,175 yuan, plus the 3,327,060 yuan carried over from the previous year. After deducting the dividends issued in the previous period, calculated at 1 shilling and 3 pence 3125, totaling 400,000 pounds sterling, and the bonuses issued to directors, there was still a remaining balance of 12,085,327 yuan. The current proposal is to distribute the following: a final dividend of 3 pounds per share, totaling 70,744,537 yuan, 1,000,000 yuan will be allocated to the bank's housing, and 3,340,789 yuan will be carried over to next year's accounts. Mr. Patterson also mentioned the silver problem, saying that silver has not been abandoned by China, but the future influence of silver seems extremely small. Mr. Patterson said at the end that everything has been considered and consulted. If China can complete and earnestly implement its internal reform procedures, then there seem to be various reasons to trust China's current currency system.

<h3>鼠食貓</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Lin'an. It is not surprising that cats eat rats, but it is indeed a strange thing for rats to eat cats. However, this is absolutely true. There are many rats in the local area, and they are unusually large and not afraid of cats. According to eyewitnesses, several cats have been killed by them. The process is quite surprising. It is said that after a group of rats encounters a cat, one rat, much like a suicide squad in the army, steps forward and suddenly attacks. This immediately attracts the attention of the other rats, who immediately surround the cat and kill it. Therefore, the number of cats in the area is particularly small.

<h3>京紫霞洞發現古墓</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Nanjing Mausoleum Administration excavated soil near the Zixia Cave reservoir last winter for construction purposes. Five stone Buddha statues were unearthed in the soil, but because their heads were broken off, it was suspected that they had been discarded, so they were left unattended. Later, several pieces of broken bricks were unearthed, but they were also not investigated further because they were considered broken bricks and tiles. Later, due to the cold weather, construction was suspended and soil excavation was stopped. Recently, construction has resumed. On the 26th, a large number of bricks were unearthed at the original location. After inspection by engineers, it was determined that it was an ancient tomb. The tomb is located between Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Mausoleum and the Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum, with a small hill rising above it and surrounded by pine and cypress trees. The location is extremely secluded and inaccessible to tourists. The upper corner of the tomb chamber has been excavated. The tomb bricks are about five inches high, more than a foot wide, and more than two feet long, without patterns. The top of the tomb is also made of bricks, with a thickness of six layers, with the upper and lower layers each having three bricks stacked in a staggered pattern. The outside of the tomb is arched, which is quite peculiar. A chamber can be seen from the crack, with a depth and width of more than two zhang (approximately 20 feet). Unfortunately, the roof of the chamber has not been fully excavated, so the entire chamber cannot be seen. Moreover, the bottom of the chamber is deeply flooded, making it difficult to enter the chamber to explore. It is said that there is another chamber inside, similar in size, with two stone doors taller than a person. The doors are flexible and can be entered. Inside, there is a stone table with patterns that are roughly identifiable. The doors, tables, and other places are painted with red lacquer, and the color is still visible. The lime on the brick walls has been eroded over time, with many white lines running down the walls, which feel sticky when touched. The management office is now taking measures to protect it pending verification. (28th day Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) The Guangdong Zhongda Research Institute unearthed an ancient tomb buried in the soil on Yougang, Dengfeng Road, in the suburbs on the 28th.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>願政府積極扶植言論界星</h3>
<p>In recent years, there have been many opinions expressed by people from all walks of life regarding the issue of freedom of speech. However, none have been more insightful than the remarks made by Chairman Chiang on the 22nd. With a few simple and clear words, he elucidated the central government's policy on public opinion, the drawbacks of past news policies, and the path that the press should take in the future. In particular, his expectation that "the central government should further improve the management of news and publications and should further support the development of the press and publishing industry" has been applauded by the press throughout the country. Now that the highest leader has made such a statement that conforms to public opinion, if the whole country acts in accordance with this principle and makes active efforts, it will not only be the good fortune of the press, but also the good fortune of the people.</p>
<p>Freedom of speech is stipulated in the constitution. Party leaders have also expressed their views on rewarding the good and eliminating the bad in the newspaper industry. In this time of serious national crisis, the current task of the press is to concentrate its will, promote the movement for national salvation and survival, create a national consciousness that unites the country, strive for national freedom and equality, and work hard on national economic and cultural construction. All newspapers, whether government-run or commercial, as long as they are not tools of traitors and bandits, should have the same goal. Today, the development of China's news industry is difficult due to various material, cultural, and social limitations. The existing structure can only be improved day by day, and there is no reason to destroy, cripple, or oppress it. Therefore, rewarding the good must be used as a means of eliminating the bad, and supporting must be used as a purpose of correcting. If a purely negative approach is used, both sides will be hurt, the country will suffer losses, and the government will not be able to deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>Today, there are many things that the press relies on the government to actively support, whether in terms of material, talent, or tools. The government should understand the difficulty of producing newspapers and the necessity of a sound press organization in this extraordinary period. There is no reason to stand idly by. The decline of the newspaper industry is mostly due to economic difficulties. The Chinese people are poor, and their purchasing power is weak. Newspapers do not dare to raise prices. China's commerce is declining, and the amount of advertising is small and the prices are low. Newspapers do not dare to ask too much from advertisers. However, the machinery of newspaper offices is imported. The paper used by newspaper offices is also imported. The price is very high. In recent months, the price of paper has risen sharply. The survival of newspapers, except for a few with a long history and sound economic organization, is in a precarious state. If the government does not reduce tariffs on the issue of paper, so that its price is reduced, or establish paper mills early to supply newspapers at low prices, this issue will inevitably become a major obstacle to the future of the newspaper industry. This is one aspect of the economy, and it is also the most important aspect.</p>
<p>The lack of talent is also the greatest difficulty felt by private newspapers. Large-scale talent training cannot be done without the power of the government. The difficulty of news gathering and the arrogance of foreign news agencies are also well known by the government and the public. The organization of large-scale international communication agencies is also a cause that the government should promote. Telegraph wires and radio waves are used by newspapers to obtain news, and their prices should be further reduced. Railways and airplanes are used by newspapers for transportation, and the press should be given preferential treatment. In various countries in the East and West, postal, telecommunications, and transportation agencies provide newspapers with meticulous preferential treatment. Only in this way can the newspaper industry develop, and only in this way can a sound public opinion be created. We do not force the government to fulfill various obligations while forgetting our own obligations. The newspaper industry is fundamentally different from other profit-making businesses. If individuals want to make big profits and get rich, then the Shanghai Bund, department stores, cotton textiles, and flour mills are all possibilities for making money. Why must they engage in the newspaper industry, which is dangerous, unprofitable, and has little profit? The newspaper industry is a public undertaking, a cultural undertaking, and is of the same nature as running schools and doing charity. Those who run newspapers should not have profit as their sole purpose. Therefore, the government should not regard the newspaper industry as a general industry. This is what the newspaper industry should particularly encourage itself to do, and it is why the government should particularly cherish and support newspapers.</p>
<p>What is the situation today? Except for a few reputable newspapers, most newspapers do not have enough income to support themselves. Those who are eager to make profits have to lower their standards. The talent they use cannot but be sought below the standard. The advertisements they publish cannot but be sought below the level of social interest. The news they publish cannot but be sought below the level of middle-class taste. What is even more pitiful is that newspapers are used for various actions that cannot be justified. Just look at the balance sheets of many inferior newspapers. Does the amount of their expenditures have 100% of its income from normal newspaper sales and legitimate advertising? If the government only restricts news and restricts operations, without opening up a broad road for the news industry, how is it any different from climbing a tree to catch fish to eliminate bad situations? From now on, we hope that the news management agencies will uphold the promise of the highest leader and actively support the press. Then the newspapers will be fortunate, and the party and the country will be fortunate.</p>
<h3>桑島赴任前視察荷印</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The new Japanese Minister to the Netherlands, Kazue Kuwashima, is scheduled to go to The Hague to take office in the coming days. However, because the Dutch East Indies has an important relationship with the Dutch government in diplomatic negotiations, Foreign Minister Hayashi decided that the minister should first inspect various parts of the Dutch East Indies before taking office. The minister is scheduled to depart on the 28th, going directly to the Dutch East Indies via Singapore. He will travel to various parts of the Dutch East Indies, such as Batavia and Surabaya, to inspect the actual situation of politics and economics and the activities of the Japanese, so as to provide resources for future diplomatic negotiations. In particular, various parts of Southeast Asia misunderstand Japan's southward policy and have territorial ambitions. Therefore, the minister will meet with Governor-General Sterelaralgenbau and Economic Officer Balde of the Dutch East Indies, as well as experts from all walks of life, to correct their misunderstandings and fully listen to the opinions of the Dutch East Indies. The minister is scheduled to return to China in mid-April to report on the inspection and take office in mid-May. (28th day Allied News dispatch)</p>
<h3>德日防共協定臻實際行動階段</h3>
<p>Determined to formally invite Italy to participate, the Japan-Italy Trade Agreement will be established soon.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the Japan-Germany Standing Committee, established on January 21 in accordance with the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact, convened four meetings, it has entered the stage of actual action. The Japanese members of the Standing Committee, namely Kojiro Inoue, counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Germany, Kobayashi, official of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, and the German member, namely Heqi, Deputy Minister of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reached a compromise after consultation and decided to formally suggest to Italy to participate in the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact in accordance with Article 2 of the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact. The new Japan-Italy Trade Agreement is currently under negotiation and is expected to be signed in mid-March. It is generally believed here that the friendship between the Japanese and Italian authorities is becoming more and more cordial, and the invitation to Italy to join the Japan-Germany Anti-Comintern Pact will definitely be successful in the future. If Italy does join the pact, Austria-Hungary and countries in Asia will also receive the same invitation. In this way, the confrontation between the world's two major camps will be further intensified. However, the possibility of Italy joining the Anti-Comintern Pact is still doubtful.

<h3>滬日商工會會長開陳對華意見</h3>
<p>China's political and economic progress is rapid, urging the government and the public to change their policies towards China.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Tadashi Yoshida, chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry and manager of the Shanghai branch of Mitsubishi Bank of Japan, has now published a booklet by the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry, which contains frank opinions on China's economic control, Sino-Japanese political and economic relations, and the Japanese people's understanding of China. It is worthy of attention. In the booklet, Yoshida strongly urges the Japanese government and the public to take advantage of the current opportunity to completely change their understanding of China. He also lists many examples of the errors in Japan's policies towards China. Yoshida points out that the Chinese National Government has completely gained control of finance and economics. He also says that Japan believes that the rise and fall of the National Government is related to the so-called Jiangsu-Zhejiang financiers, but the current National Government can enjoy the economic benefits of the whole country. This is unprecedented in Chinese history. Japan feels that China lacks unity and believes that the Chinese people are like scattered sand that cannot be united. However, the sand has now become as solid as cement. This should be attributed to the reaction to the oppression of Japan and other countries. Yoshida then criticizes some Japanese people's views that China's financial situation is unstable, and asserts that China's financial situation is now stable, which can be proved by the international payment and great improvement. At the same time, he puts forward two points that the Chinese government should reconsider: ㊀ The concentration of central finance, the accumulation of funds in Shanghai and Nanjing is too large, while the provinces are neglected; ㊁ Excessive reliance on foreign countries. Yoshida then expressed pessimism when talking about the future of Sino-Japanese relations, predicting that economic cooperation is impossible. After various political and cultural relations between China and Japan are completely on the verge of rupture, Japan should maintain friendship with China through economic cooperation. However, Japan has adopted the opposite policy, which has led to the decline of Japan's economic relations with China, such as Japan's attitude towards China's currency reform in 1935 and the so-called special trade in North China. Japan may think its attitude is reasonable, but China feels that this attitude is extremely unreasonable and incomprehensible. The major powers are now striving to create new opportunities to cope with the new situation, while Japan is standing idly by. Regarding the old saying of economic cooperation, Yoshida said that this kind of cooperation is only possible when China is still in a semi-feudal and semi-colonial state and China is still a primitive agricultural country. However, China's political and economic situation has recently made rapid progress, which has resulted in the Chinese people having a sincere feeling for their destiny. In addition, the advantage of the European and American forces in China has made Sino-Japanese relations worse than before. Yoshida concludes by advocating that Japan should not ignore the situation and be indifferent, but must find ways to improve relations with China. Yoshida finally warns that Japan must eliminate its severe policies towards China and adopt policies that are morally acceptable to the Chinese government and are practical. He also says that it is absurd for Japan to accuse China of disregarding sincerity or adopting a policy of attacking from afar, because Japanese diplomacy and government authorities must also bear part of the responsibility.

<h3>Japanese Parliament Enters Third Phase of Battle</h3>
<p>Budget Committee Opens Subcommittees, Manchurian Incident Secret Expenses Questioned by Representatives of the People's Government Party</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The parliament on the 28th, only the House of Representatives opened subcommittees simultaneously after 10 a.m., with only preliminary questioning battles on the first day, so all adjourned after noon, and will enter the third phase of battle tomorrow (28th, Domei News).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The House of Representatives' budget committee, which has been debating for ten days since the 17th, completed its questioning on the 27th. Although the 28th was a Sunday, the budget subcommittees opened simultaneously at 10 a.m. The budgets of various ministries are managed separately in the subcommittees, and deliberations will be conducted until March 3rd. During this period of questioning, the government will clarify why the electricity control bill and the compulsory education extension bill were not submitted to this parliament, and the issue of increased funding will also be resolved. The budget committee will reconvene on March 4th, the parties will decide their attitudes on the 5th, and the budget bill will be voted on on the 6th (28th, Domei News).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) When the Japanese budget committee's fourth subcommittee discussed military expenses today, a representative of the People's Government Party questioned that 7 million yen was used to expand secret expenses in the Manchurian Incident expenses, asking what the purpose was. Another representative of the People's Government Party pointed out that Japan's annual military secret expenses do not exceed 270,000 yen, but the total amount of secret expenses in the Manchurian Incident expenses has reached a huge 48 million yen in the five years since 1932. He went on to say that if the rumor that most of these secret expenses were reinvested in our country for political purposes is true, it would be completely contrary to the original mission of the army. Vice Minister of the Army Umezu Mijiro replied that the secret expenses of the Manchurian Incident should be clearly distinguished from the secret expenses of "Manchukuo," and that none of the expenditures were contrary to the original purpose, and that it was extremely inaccurate that such funds were used for domestic affairs. A representative of the People's Government Party also asked how far the division could be increased, and whether the domestic army would be reduced after the division stationed in Manchuria was increased. Umezu replied that it was difficult to clearly explain whether or not the division would be increased at present, but it was a fact that the army's military strength would be increased, and that the increase in military strength in Manchuria would not reduce the military strength in the country. Looking at the above Q&amp;A, two doubts can be found: first, what exactly was the nearly 10 million yen used for secret expenses in Manchuria in the past five years? Second, the new budget has included military expansion expenses, so how much will the number of Japanese troops increase? (Central News, 28th)</p>
<h3>New Army Funding Request</h3>
<p>Minister of the Army Attends to Explain</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of the Army Sugiyama explained in detail the new funding request for the annual army budget and its contents at the fourth subcommittee of the budget on the 28th. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ 234,728 (units in thousands of yen, same below) for the improvement and maintenance of military equipment in Manchuria, i.e., improving, increasing, and maintaining the naval, land, and air forces in China and Manchuria, dispatching some divisions, and relocating some units returning to the mainland.</p>
<p>㊁ 102.188 for the improvement of aviation and air defense, enhancing aviation and air defense replenishment, education, training, and expanding staff training centers, is a continuing project from the 12th year to the 18th year, with a total amount of 352,834,000 yen.</p>
<p>㊂ 24.741 for the improvement of military equipment, increasing military strength, improving organization, increasing stationed troops, and improving anti-Vance, anti-air, anti-tank communication and other facilities, etc., is a continuing project from the 12th year to the 18th year, with a total amount of more than 138,070,000 yen.</p>
<p>㊃ 40.000 for material preparation, preparing operational materials, is a continuing project from the 12th year to the 18th year, with a total amount of 900 million yen.</p>
<p>㊄ 8.237 for other general new items (28th, Kokumin News).</p>
<h3>Japanese Covet New Guinea Island</h3>
<p>Representatives of the People's Government Party Propose Demanding that the Netherlands Cede It</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the first subcommittee of the Japanese budget committee met today to discuss the expenses of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs under the budget, Sakurai Hyogoro, a representative of the People's Government Party, proposed that Japan demand that the Netherlands permanently cede New Guinea Island in the Dutch East Indies. Sakurai said that the territory of New Guinea Island is more extensive than the Japanese mainland, but it has not yet been developed, which is extremely unreasonable, and asked whether the government has the courage to frankly demand that the Netherlands permanently cede the island and its neighboring islands in order to solve the Japanese population problem. Sakurai believes that Japan has no other plans in the South Sea Islands other than this. If this plan can be successful, peace can be maintained forever, and Japan and the Dutch East Indies can conclude a non-aggression treaty. When Prime Minister Hayashi replied, he generally expressed agreement with Sakurai's opinion, and said that the government has not yet reached the stage of studying the issue of ceding New Guinea, but will use your opinion as a reference to start studying the issue (28th, Central News Agency).</p>
<h3>Issue of Cash Export</h3>
<p>Specific Details of the Content</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Yuki replied to the question of Oko Kiroku of the Seiyukai at the third subcommittee of the budget on the 28th. Regarding the issue of cash export, he revealed the government's beliefs and stated that cash export will not use gold coins but gold bars, cash export will be carried out with government bills, and cash export does not necessarily require devaluation. The Ministry of Finance is currently consulting with the Bank of Japan and the Yokohama Specie Bank, and the specific details can be determined within a few days. The contents are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ The method of cash export is determined to be carried out according to government calculations. The destination of cash export is New York, and gold bars will be exported in fractions several times at any time.</p>
<p>㊀ The timing of cash export is approximately from March 10th to 15th.</p>
<p>㊀ The amount of cash export is approximately 15 million yen for the first time, but in the future, the scheduled cash export must reach 200 million to 300 million yen.</p>
<p>㊀ Disposal of profits from the Bank of Japan: The profits obtained by the Bank of Japan due to cash export will be disposed of appropriately in the future.</p>
<p>㊀ Issue of currency devaluation: The currency has actually been devalued, and the procedures for legalizing it are also very easy, but there is no need for it now.</p>
<p>㊀ Issue of gold purchase price: The issue of raising the gold purchase price may occur in the future, but there is no need for it today (28th, Domei News).</p>
<h3>Japan Will Follow Our Country in Issuing Aviation Lottery Tickets</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Aviation Promotion Association, organized around retired and reserve generals, believes that the aviation and air defense industries are urgent and large, and cannot be satisfied only by the state's budget, so it has drafted an aviation industry incentive bill, which will be submitted to both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives. The content is to organize a legal entity to issue patriotic aviation lottery tickets, each ticket costs three yen, and six issues are issued a year, totaling 36 million yen, 12 million shares. The prize money is 12 million yen per year, and the rest goes to the government. There are five first prizes of 50,000 yen, fifteen second prizes of 10,000 yen, five hundred third prizes of 1,000 yen, ten thousand fourth prizes of 100 yen, and one hundred thousand fifth prizes of 5 yen. Approximately one in eighteen people will win a prize (28th, Domei News).</p>
<h3>Internal Disputes of the Seiyukai Resolved</h3>

With the unanimous approval of the general meeting of members, the party's internal disputes since President Suzuki expressed his intention to resign on the 15th have been resolved satisfactorily (28th, Domei News).</p>
<h3>Sudden Slowdown of Nippon Yusen Kaisha Sailors</h3>
<p>Planned by the Tokyo Meirokai, Apparently with an Overly Radical Ideological Background</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Yusen Meirokai, organized by the core sailors of Nippon Yusen, accused the company of failing to fly flags to celebrate the naval review held by the company in the Hanshin area last autumn. On the 28th, they submitted a request in the name of the general representative of the Meirokai, and at the same time, the association's office issued instructions to the ships departing from Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe on the 28th to stop sailing. Therefore, the "Katori Maru" scheduled to depart from Yokohama, the "Anyo Maru" departing from Osaka, and the "Shanghai Maru" departing from Kobe had to postpone their departure. The "Kasagi Maru" and "Nagasaki Maru," which were scheduled to depart on the same day, also received the same order to stop sailing.</p>
<p>Three Requests Submitted</p>
<p>The contents of the request:</p>
<p>㊀ Hope to clarify the responsibility for the disrespect issue, eliminate the root of the disaster and utilitarianism, and resolutely rectify the company's discipline. ㊀ In order to establish a guiding spirit based on Japanism, immediately carry out a complete reform of the maritime department, etc., and two other articles.</p>
<p>Company's Attitude</p>
<p>President Otani, Vice President Watanabe, and Standing Director Shimizu of the Nippon Yusen headquarters, who were thrown into chaos by the sudden strike of senior sailors guided by the Meirokai, contacted various branches to collect information and discuss countermeasures. President Otani informally expressed the company's attitude towards this dispute as follows: The senior sailor group of this Meirokai suddenly claimed that there was an act of disrespect during the naval review last autumn, which led to the dispute, which is unbelievable. The company acted in accordance with the orders of the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Communications at that time. If there was any mistake, it should protest to the Ministry of the Navy and the Ministry of Communications. In addition, the Meirokai group has an ideological group behind it, and there is a fact that people with overly radical ideas have formed a group and acted. This can be seen from the fact that senior sailors who landed ashore were imprisoned at the time of the dispute. The company will never recognize this Meirokai. Even if a few senior sailors disembark, it will not matter. The ships scheduled to depart will definitely be allowed to depart. Although the "Katori Maru" was delayed due to the rain on the 27th, it will definitely depart on the day of loading (28th, Domei News).</p>
<p>Branch Executes Orders</p>
<p>⊙Osaka: The Osaka branch of the Meirokai received a report from the Tokyo Nippon Yusen Meirokai headquarters on the 28th regarding the submission of a request to the company and an order to stop sailing. It immediately convened more than 30 members at the Mishima Inn in Osaka City, responded to each other under the guidance of the headquarters, and contacted senior sailors scattered throughout the country in order to achieve the request. An executive of the association issued a statement saying that if even one request cannot be achieved, it will remain immovable and insist on reforming the company's claims under the imperial spirit, betting on its family and life (28th, Domei News).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The ships belonging to Nippon Yusen that were scheduled to depart on the 28th and were suspended from departure due to the Meirokai's order to stop sailing totaled seven in Yokohama, Osaka, and Kobe. In addition, the "Shanghai Maru," which received the order to stop sailing, lifted the order because it heard that Count Otani Kouchou was on board and sailed to Shanghai (28th, Domei News).</p>
<p>Seamen's Union Exercises Self-Restraint</p>
<p>(Yokohama) Since the Meirokai began planning, the headquarters of the Japanese Seamen's Union held a meeting of the leading members on the 28th. Due to the many unclear points about the Meirokai's purpose, it issued instructions to the branches of each union to exercise self-restraint and caution, and not to be taken advantage of by the Meirokai's planning this time. The Meirokai was established in Showa 10 (1935) and is organized by second and third officers, engineers, and radio technicians, etc. It has 500 members and was created for the purpose of promoting transparency and improving welfare within the company (28th, Domei News).</p>
<h3>US Commissioner to the Philippines Sworn In</h3>
<p>Roosevelt and Quezon Witness the Oath</p>
<p>(Washington) The newly appointed US High Commissioner to the Philippines, Maynard, was sworn in today in the office of Woodring, Secretary of War. President Roosevelt and Philippine President Quezon were both present to witness the oath. Afterwards, President Quezon spoke to reporters and denied that he intended to run for re-election, saying that the Philippine constitution restricts the president from running for re-election, which he advocated. As for the gold mining in the Philippines, it has made great progress (27th, Kokumin News).</p>
<h3>Issue of Negotiating the Rome Treaty Britain Urges Italy and Germany to Reply</h3>
<p>Germany Makes Colonial Demands to Britain Ribbentrop Returns Home to Report</p>
<p>(Berlin)</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of the New Locarno Pact, after the British government submitted notes to France, Belgium, Italy, and Germany for the second time, the German and Italian governments have not yet submitted replies. The British authorities are extremely concerned and have once again urged Germany through diplomatic channels. The Frankfurter Zeitung commented that there are still many obstacles to concretizing this matter. "The reason why Britain advocates the establishment of this treaty is said to be to obtain guarantees to prevent foreign aggression. In fact, after the general staffs of Britain and France established mutual assistance measures, France has already given it a guarantee, so why seek others? It can be seen that Britain's insistence on the New Locarno Pact is obviously for other purposes. In addition, Britain and France have different views on general European issues. France is most concerned about Eastern Europe, followed by the Mediterranean. Britain focuses on the Mediterranean, followed by Central Europe, and then Eastern Europe. Does Britain intend for Germany to participate in negotiations regardless of whether Britain has any concrete suggestions? The country almost believes that the solution to general European issues is better than the establishment of a treaty between Britain, France, and Germany, so that when disputes arise in the Mediterranean in the future, its nature will be more serious than last year's Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and the country can have nothing to fear?" (28th, Havas News)</p>
<p>(London) German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop returned to Berlin by plane today. He will participate in the Leipzig Spring Fair and give a speech entitled "Germany's Wishes for World Trade" (27th, Kokumin News).</p>
<p>(London) German Ambassador to Britain Ribbentrop returned to his country by special train today, ostensibly to give a speech in Leipzig, but it is known that he will report to Hitler on the results of his discussion with British Foreign Secretary Eden last Friday on Germany's colonial demands (27th, Kokumin News).</p>
<h3>Belgian Prime Minister Travels Abroad</h3>

<p>(Paris) The Paris Morning Post recently reported that the Prime Minister of Belgium has gone to Switzerland and may come to Paris on his way back to the country to meet with key figures in French political circles to discuss the issue of the New Locarno Pact (28th, Havas News).</p>
<h3>Dutch Military Spending Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Strengthening Naval and Air Force Power Budget Approved by the Upper House</p>
<p>⊙Amsterdam: The Dutch Upper House today approved the national defense budget. Prime Minister Colin gave a speech before the vote, declaring that the national defense expenditure in 1936 and 1937 increased by 89 million guilders compared with 1935, of which 29 million was for naval expenditure. Eight submarines are under construction, and 100 military aircraft will also be completed. Colin declared that if the Netherlands does not take necessary measures after the completion of the Franco-Belgian defense line, the Netherlands will become a battlefield once war breaks out. He also said that the status of the Dutch East Indies is also different from the past, so the Netherlands must bear huge national defense costs. The Prime Minister opposed the issuance of public debt, and he pointed out that the increased national defense expenditure should be allocated from regular income (27th, Kokumin News).</p>
<h3>British Naval Exercises in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>⊙Malta: The British Mediterranean Fleet departed from here today to hold winter exercises as usual (27th, Kokumin News).</p>
<h3>Spanish Rebels Bomb Capital</h3>
<p>Suburban Militia Advances and Is Defeated</p>
<p>⊙Madrid: The government army authorities issued a battle report stating that the rebel artillery had fired on the central area of the city, and the damage to the city was very serious, but the exact number of casualties has not yet been ascertained. In addition, the artillery of both sides is currently bombarding each other in the area of Guadarrama and Somosa Mountains north of the city (28th, Havas News).</p>
<p>⊙Madrid: Our reporter's special dispatch, at 3:45 pm today, the National Army artillery bombarded the capital, and several shells with a diameter of 155 millimeters landed in the bustling area of the capital and hit a building. The situation on the front lines near the capital was very quiet. Only in the area of the Harama River in the southeast, the government army artillery bombarded the National Army positions in the city of Maranosa for four hours. Both sides seem to be waiting for an opportunity to prepare for a renewed offensive (27th, Havas News).</p>
<p>⊙Avila: Today, a thousand members of the government army's militia set out, intending to take the strategy of flanking to capture the Robberton De Chiav station, nine miles south of Escorial. Unexpectedly, they suddenly encountered 200 members of the National Army. The National Army strafed with machine guns from the top of the mountain, causing the militia to die in large numbers. The wounded were all captured, and none survived (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters).</p>
<h3>Results of Indian Provincial Elections</h3>
<p>National Congress Party Wins Big</p>
<p>⊙Bombay: The final results of the provincial elections under the new Indian constitution show that the National Congress Party has an absolute majority in the administrative regions of Bombay and Madras, the United Provinces and the Central Provinces, Bihar, and Orissa. In Bengal, Assam, and the Northwest Frontier Province, the National Congress Party is the largest single party, while in Punjab and Sindh, the parties that support the constitution have won a majority. The National Congress Party's victory in Madras is the most remarkable, because the Justice Party has long dominated there for the past 14 years, but in this election, the Justice Party was defeated miserably, winning only 16 seats, while the National Congress Party won 159 seats and occupied 26 of the 46 seats in the upper house. However, whether the National Congress Party members will take office depends on Gandhi's will, and the final decision will be made at the All India National Congress Party Congress in Delhi in mid-March. The current official goal of the National Congress Party is the destruction of the constitution (Central News Agency, 28th, Reuters).</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan's Spring Banquet in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Qin Dechun Talks About His Impressions of the Third Plenary Session Chen Juesheng Talks About His Views on North China's Diplomacy</p>
<p>Tianjin Communication: Song Zheyuan originally planned to leave Tianjin and return to Beiping after the Lantern Festival, but he postponed his departure to wait for Qin Dechun to return to Tianjin and report on the Third Plenary Session. Taking advantage of his stay in Tianjin and because there are no special issues in North China's diplomatic and political situation recently, he decided to invite guests in Tianjin on March 2nd and 3rd. All celebrities in Tianjin, important figures in the field, key personnel related to Hebei and Chahar, and foreign guests are on the list of invitations, and invitation cards have been issued. The reception locations are divided into two places, one is at 89 Jingsheng Society, 19th Road, British Concession (the society was purchased from the descendants of President Li Da at a price of 170,000 yuan, originally the Li family's Tianjin residence), and the other is at the Cao Residence Garden on Huangwei Road, Hebei. In addition to drinking and having fun, famous actors Shang Xiaoyun, Cheng Yanqiu, Hou Xirui, and Li Hongchun are invited to perform. The play list is personally arranged by Song. Li will perform "The Ancient City Meeting," Shang will perform "Nineteen Knights of Qingcheng," and Cheng will perform "The Story of Red Whiskers," all of which imply encouragement and self-improvement. The dinner will be prepared by chefs from Dongxinglou, Fengzeyuan, and Xilaishun restaurants in Beiping. From March 1st to 3rd, special trains will be added between Beiping and Tianjin on the Beining Road to welcome and send guests. Song will leave Tianjin and return to Beiping two days after the banquet. From February 27th, key personnel from Hebei and Chahar and the 29th Army came to Tianjin from Beiping to attend the grand event, causing general hotels to be fully booked.</p>
<p>Qin Dechun returned to Tianjin from Beijing at 7:40 pm on the 27th. After getting off the train at the new station, he went straight to Song's residence on Qiangzi Road in the British Concession to meet Song and report on his attendance at the Third Plenary Session. Zhang Zizhong, Feng Zhian, Liu Ruming, Guo Zhihan, Yang Zhaogeng, Wang Shijiu, and others all gathered at Song's residence to listen to the situation. Qin is now accompanying Song in Tianjin to entertain guests and will not return to Beiping to handle government affairs until three days later. According to Qin, the process of going south is roughly as follows: "I had an excellent impression of attending the Third Plenary Session this time. Most of the conference proposals focused on internal issues of anti-communism and external issues of diplomacy. Regarding anti-communism, as the declaration shows, its spirit is also very applicable in North China. The wording of the declaration has been revised several times before it was published, and all the words have been carefully considered and deliberated. Its prudence and solemnity can be imagined. Regarding diplomatic issues, the central government's decision is also as stated in the declaration. From now on, the whole country will work together to achieve it in the principle of sincere unity. The conference did not make a separate proposal for North China. While in Beijing, I met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek three times and the ministers of various central ministries several times to explain in detail the situation in North China maintained by Chairman Song over the past year. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the ministers of various ministries have fully understood the situation in Hebei and Chahar. Before leaving Beijing, I met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once again, and he was very comforting. I did not stop when I passed through Shandong. Shandong Province sent Zhang Tie to Beijing to attend the Third Plenary Session, and he will also return to Shandong to report in the next few days."</p>
<p>Li Sihao came to Tianjin from Beiping on the 27th, possibly to visit Ikeda and Jugo Koshikawa, president of the Japan Xingzhong Company, to discuss the revitalization of the Longyan Mine. Chen Juesheng told people on the 27th, "North China's diplomacy in the past year has been handled with compromise based on the principles of preserving territorial sovereignty and stabilizing people's hearts. Although there have been three or two minor twists and turns, the results have all been resolved satisfactorily based on these principles. At present, local people's hearts and social prosperity have increased compared with the past. This year, the authorities will still bear the responsibility based on this principle, and in addition, they will use their remaining strength to seek the development of economic construction. After the Japanese government changed its prime minister, the new cabinet's policy has changed slightly, and it may no longer have the idea of ​​invading North China. If there is no external force to obstruct it, North China's situation this year will definitely be better than last year (28th)."</p>
<h3>Hunan Blocking Dongting Lake Dispute Expands</h3>
<p>Entire Hubei Public is Planning Resistance, Jianli Chewan River Embankment Suddenly Collapses</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Regarding the case of Hunan Province building dikes and weirs in Dongting Lake, blocking four mouths of the Yangtze River, the people of various counties along the river in Hubei Province previously rose up in resistance, followed by the provincial party headquarters and the two chambers of commerce in Wuhan opposing it, thus the issue expanded. President Jiang of the Executive Yuan also attached great importance to this matter and has handed it over to the National Economic Council for investigation and handling. Currently, the people of Jiangling, Jianli, Tianmen, Mianyang and other counties along the river have elected Xie Shengkan, Chuan Xiangrong, Shen Zhaonian, Zhang Nanxian and others as representatives, initiating a joint meeting of representatives of fellow villagers associations in Wuhan from various counties, scheduled for March 7th, to discuss countermeasures. On February 27th, a notice was issued with impassioned language, the original text saying: "Hubei has always been known as a land of lakes, with the Yangtze River running through it. The fate of more than twenty counties along the banks rests on the dikes. Since the old courses of the nine holes and thirteen mouths cannot be fully restored, we can only rely on the existing Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi and Tiaoxian four mouths to divert water into Dongting Lake, slightly reducing the force of the surging waves. In recent years, various places have arbitrarily blocked and built tributaries, competing with the water for land, leading to the horizontal encroachment and blocking of the above-mentioned four mouths repeatedly. Disasters of this kind are still common. It is said that Hunan is raising 50,000 yuan to prepare for construction, and a review of a certain water conservancy publication containing Li Yizhi's suggestions for managing Dongting Lake also states that the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission intends to build rolling dams at the Songzi, Taiping, Ouchi, and Tiaoxian four mouths. If this becomes a reality, it would not only greatly violate Chairman Jiang's directive to return farmland to lakes, but also cause floods to inundate the dikes along the Yangtze River in Hubei, leading to an irreparable collapse. We will soon see the Yangtze River changing its course, Dongting Lake moving north, the confluence of the Jiang and Xiang rivers, and the people of Hubei buried in the waves. The stakes are so high that we cannot sit idly by. We have specially arranged to meet at the Jingnan Middle School in Wuchang on March 7th to discuss proper countermeasures. In addition to reporting to the Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters and the Provincial Capital Police Bureau to send personnel for guidance, we plan to first convene fellow villagers residing in Wuhan from your county to discuss in advance, and elect representatives to attend the meeting at Jingnan Middle School on the scheduled date. This matter concerns the public interest of the entire province, so please do not delay.”</p>
<p>Amidst the particularly tense situation regarding the Hunan-Hubei water conservancy issue, the Chewan River Embankment in Jianli suddenly collapsed. This embankment blocks the mighty Yangtze River, serving as the only guarantee for Jianli, Mianyang, Hanchuan, Jiayu, and Hanyang counties, no less important than the Yaodi Embankment in Zhongxiang and the Wancheng Embankment in Jingzhou. Over the years, annual repairs have cost a huge amount of money, and the Yue Di Embankment was built in advance to prevent accidents. Unexpectedly, recently, the foundation of the Yongxing godown at the embankment was eroded by backflow, and the outer bank suddenly collapsed, endangering the fundamental main embankment. Upon receiving the report, the National Economic Council ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to rush to transport boulders and weave them into cages to throw into the collapsed area for protection. However, due to the changing river course, the Yongxing Wharf embankment section continued to collapse after re-evaluation. Within a month or so, more than thirty zhang collapsed, and the Qingguo Wharf was also affected, with a collapsing trend. The embankment body that is about to collapse now is approximately four li long, in a state of extreme danger. In addition to Jianghan Engineering Bureau Director Xi Dejiong, National Economic Council Technical Specialist Wang Huzhen, Chief Engineer Shi Dupei, and others going to devise ways to rush to protect the embankment, various institutions and legal entities in Jianli are also uniting with people from the seven counties whose survival depends on this embankment to appeal to the central and Hubei governments and the water conservancy authorities to allocate three-tenths of the funds for protecting the Yaodi Embankment to quickly deal with the danger, in order to protect the lives and property of the people of the seven counties. It is said that at this time, the river water is unusually dry, but the major main embankment of the Yangtze River is in danger. The reason for the failure is that the maintenance of the embankment body was not solid, and the project was neglected and shoddy, not related to the immersion and erosion of the water. If work is not started quickly and it is still treated as a child's play, then as soon as the spring water rises, the seven counties of Jianli and Mianyang will immediately become a major disaster, without waiting for the great flood in midsummer.

<p>Lancang Correspondence: The Sino-British Joint Survey Committee of the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border held a meeting on January 2nd in Laochang. The Chinese members were Liang Yugao and Zhang Zuyin, and the British members were Graesser and Towerz. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Upper Border Itinerary</p>
<p>The Chinese members of the Sino-British Joint Survey of the Southern Section of the Yunnan-Burma Border departed from Kunming on November 29th of last year, passed through Chuxiong, and arrived in Dali on the 30th, where they prepared packhorses and other matters. Liu Maoqing, the brigade commander of the local defense army, and Shi Minzhai, the pacification director, entertained everything after the arrival of the two members, Liang and Zhang, and led them to visit their barracks and other places. Brigade Commander Liu has been stationed in the area for many years and pays attention to construction projects. Sheng Lu Park and the barracks are among his military and industrial construction projects. The park faces Erhai Lake, with the morning glow and evening shadows in full view, and is backed by Cangshan Mountain, with snow accumulating year after year. The brigade's barracks do not borrow from civilian residences, but are built purely by military workers, neat and orderly, with fixed places for officers and soldiers to live, which can be called a model army on the border. On December 3rd, the upper border transportation was ready, and the entire group departed from Xiaguan. They stayed in Taicang that day, and arrived in Menghua on the 4th. This place was formerly a subprefecture and is now a county seat. The city walls are simple and ancient, and the streets are wide, making it a major town in the border area. On the 5th, they arrived in Luoqiu. The terrain here gradually rises, already 6,000 feet above sea level. The mountain paths along the way are extremely rugged and can hardly be called roads. People and horses staggered down through the gravel in the mountain streams. On the 6th, they arrived in Gonglang. The mountain road is also extremely rugged, with gravel slabs covering the road, mixed with dust, which is easy to float. The horseshoes slid down diagonally and could not stand still. The terrain on the border of the Yunnan and Burma is all "undulating land." Every day's itinerary includes uphill and downhill slopes, with ups and downs of thirty to forty li. Those who come for the first time find it bitter to climb, and bitter to descend, but after a while, they become accustomed to it. On the 7th, they went from Gonglang to Shaojie. On the way, they passed the Shenzhou Ferry. The Han Prime Minister's so-called "crossing the Lu River with an isolated army in May" refers to crossing this water. The water rises rapidly in the hot months, making it truly difficult to cross the Lu River in May. The river flows a little slower in winter, but the terrain at the river crossing point is precipitous, and people and horses are crowded, with no room to stay. After crossing the river, they climbed a steep cliff. The road is sloping and steep, and at its most dangerous, it is angled from sixty to seventy degrees. Looking down at the riverbank, there is no ground below. With the slightest carelessness, one could be crushed to pieces. It can be said that there is absolutely no plain land here. In addition to opening up mountain fields, few paddy fields are seen. On the 8th, they went from Shaojie to Maolan. There are hot springs in this place. From here onwards, hot springs are frequently seen, and the smell of sulfur is very strong. It is expected that there are many sulfur mines along this area. On the 9th, they arrived in Yun County. The terrain gradually becomes flat, and the fields become fertile. Malignant malaria is prevalent in this county. It is said that two to three thousand people have died from the epidemic in the hot months. Those in charge of sanitation and health should pay attention to this. The epidemic began to slow down slightly in winter. On the 10th, they arrived at Toudaoshui. The residents are extremely poor. They struggle to make a living, and their clothes do not cover their bodies. Even in the dead of winter, they wear single clothes and have no bedding. They rely on sunlight during the day and light fires at night to keep warm. On the 11th, they arrived at Ant Hill. The houses are simple, with few tile houses besides thatched huts. On the 12th, they arrived at Mianning City. This is the only city on the border. After passing this, they entered the territory of Lancang County. Lancang County has moved its seat several times, and the location of the subprefecture seat has no city walls to this day, only a county office. On the 30th, the entire office of the Chinese members arrived at Laochang, the meeting place for both parties, setting up tents and camps, and preparing everything.</p>
<p>Personnel of Both Sides</p>
<p>The chairman of the current neutral committee is still Colonel Isselin. Mr. Bret is Isselin's accompanying secretary. Both were specially appointed by the League of Nations and are of Swiss nationality. Liang Yu, the Chinese member, replaced Mr. Klerger, the chief member of the previous session, who resigned due to illness. Graesser, a member of the previous session, was promoted to chief member, and Towerz, the consul with the title of consul general, who is currently the consul in Tengchong, was assigned as a member. Towerz served as the consul in Tengchong for many years. During last year's border survey, he served as a consultant to the British side. He can speak fluent Chinese, can read and write Chinese characters, and is quite familiar with the Chinese situation.</p>
<p>Meeting Location</p>
<p>The Chinese side originally proposed Bangsang as the meeting location, the reason being that the weather is suitable for work in the winter months, but it was not completely decided at that time. The British side proposed the second point of longitude and latitude on the treaty (i.e., what is commonly known as Point B) as the meeting location, on the grounds that the survey work began at the second point of longitude and latitude on the treaty, (that is, what is commonly called point B), and that the itinerary of the surveyors and the committee was consistent, which would be convenient for the protection of the army. Subsequently, the neutral chairman decided that the meeting location would be Laochang, because the previous session closed in Laochang, and this session should continue the work of the previous session, and there is nothing better than meeting at the place where the previous session closed.</p>
<p>Camps of Both Sides</p>
<p>Laochang is famous for producing silver and lead. Even now, lead tiles from the Ming Dynasty can still be excavated from the ground. During its heyday, there were many lead factories, with residents numbering five to six thousand. Later, the Lahu people rebelled, carrying out massacres, and the residents scattered, so its industry declined. Today, only broken walls and ruins remain, as well as one or two lead factories mined by indigenous methods. The Chinese camp was set up on a large lawn next to the lead factory. The four mountains surround it, and the temperature varies greatly from morning to afternoon (from 30 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit). After some initial tidying up, tents were set up, lined up in rows, orderly and well-arranged. The gate of the camp was decorated with the flags of the party and the country, and the guards stood upright, solemnly guarding it. At night, the watch drums were stern, and the staff worked until late at night, creating an atmosphere of ten thousand tents without disputes. The British camp was located in Mipawei, fifteen li away from the Chinese camp. The British camp was laid out against the mountainside, making it very convenient for security. The troops brought by the British side consisted of three parts: British soldiers, Indian soldiers, and Burmese soldiers.</p>
<p>Beginning of Meeting</p>
<p>Before the event, after the British members arrived on December 29th, they began to communicate with the local area by letter. The Chinese members believed that Laochang was a local place in their own country, and they should first pay a visit to the British side. After notifying them by letter, on the morning of the 31st, the two members, Liang and Zhang, along with Secretary Director Tang Chengyou and secretaries Xu Yunchen and four other staff members, as well as the head of the guard team, went to the British camp for a meeting. As soon as they arrived at the gate of the camp, the British army raised the Chinese national flag amidst the sound of bugles, and the entire venue stood in silence to pay their respects. Thus, the flags of both sides (the British flag on the left and the Chinese flag on the right) fluttered in the solemn atmosphere. At about 11 o'clock, the neutral chairman, Mr. Isselin, arrived with his secretary, and they first paid a visit to the neutral chairman. At 12 o'clock, the British side hosted a banquet, with members, secretaries, directors, guard team officers, and others attending as guests. During the banquet, the neutral chairman stood up and gave a speech, briefly saying that Mr. Warless, the British member of the previous session, has been promoted to chief member this time, which is worthy of congratulations. He expressed his respect to Mr. Liang, the Chinese member, for resuming his position as chief member, and congratulated Mr. Towerz of the British side and Mr. Zhang Zuyin of the Chinese side for their appointment as members. He then mentioned that Mr. Klerger, the chief member of the British side in the previous session, and Mr. Yin, the Chinese member of the previous session, could not attend due to illness and personal matters, which he regretted. He went on to say that the border survey work is indeed a difficult task. We have encountered many difficulties in the previous session, and the difficulties this time may be even greater than those in the previous session, but I hope that both sides will maintain the spirit of cooperation and complete the mission we are entrusted with. Then, he raised his glass to wish good health to the members of both sides and all those present. The members of both sides then gave speeches, expressing their respect to the neutral chairman, Mr. Isselin, and expressing their regret that the former members Klerger and Yin could not participate this time. At about 2 o'clock, the Chinese members said goodbye and left. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Request to Abolish Business Tax</p>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce, based on the recommendations of the Iron Machine Silk Weaving, Yarn Satin, and other trade associations, believes that the business tax, which is now being levied by the Ministry of Finance, conflicts with the nature of the income tax and is almost a double tax. It should be abolished to avoid double taxation on one item. Furthermore, at a time when commerce is in extreme decline, the government is also sympathetic to reducing burdens and eliminating excessive regulations. The Chamber of Commerce should advocate this together with Shanghai and other ports. Based on this, the Chamber of Commerce of Jiangsu Province has scheduled a joint meeting for March 1st. Therefore, the original proposal was submitted for discussion. It was unanimously agreed to submit another report to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting a clear order to abolish the business tax. As for the income tax regulations, the first category, subcategory A, which starts taxation for capital above 2,000 yuan, should be changed to start taxation for capital above 5,000 yuan to relieve small businesses and merchants. This was also submitted to the Provincial Chamber of Commerce for discussion and advocacy.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Emergency Prevention of Meningitis</p>
<p>Tan Shouren, the preparatory director of the local health office, due to the recent discovery of meningitis in various parts of the city and countryside, with successive deaths of residents, convened an epidemic prevention meeting yesterday in order to prevent the disease. It was resolved: 1. As a defensive step, a general mobilization will be launched to administer vaccinations. 2. Nurses and health teams will be dispatched to the Xindu Bridge and other areas in the Fourth District to suppress the disease. 3. The First Department will be responsible for intelligence, and health police will be responsible for investigative work. 4. A defense team will be organized. 5. The vaccination time will be set. 6. Prevention expenses will be temporarily paid from the funds of this office. If the disease spreads and many medicines are used, a request for appropriation will be submitted. On the 28th, more than 100 residents went to the office to receive vaccinations. Also, Sun Lindi, a girl from No. 17 Qinfu Lane, Zhoushan, who was seriously ill with meningitis, is no longer in danger after being injected with serum.</p>
<h3>Expansion of Woolen Cloth Factory</h3>
<p>The Xiexin Woolen Cloth Factory in Wuyabing, outside the North Gate of this city, was founded by Tang Xiangting of this city in the previous year. Due to the excellent quality of its products and the prosperous business, the factory added a wool combing machine worth over 10,000 yuan last year. At the end of the past year, it ended with a great profit. The factory has now started work again and intends to expand this year. The Gengyu Cloth Factory outside the West Gate originally had 280 looms. Last year's profit was more than 440,000, so it also needs to add four looms this year to expand its scope.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Approved Exemption from Fishing Tax</p>
<p>The fishing tax of this county is 7 taels, 9 qian, 7 fen, and 6 li of silver per year. It has always been paid by fishermen along the Yangtze River. The county government believes that this fishing tax is very small and similar to excessive miscellaneous taxes. In order to reduce the burden on fishermen and develop the fishing industry, it specially submitted a justification and reported to the province for approval to stop collecting it.</p>
<h3>Dredging the City River, Assisting with Donations According to Grade</h3>
<p>The Construction Committee decided to hold a meeting on the 27th to dredge the city river. Residents in the city will donate according to four grades: Special Grade: Donate according to ability; Grade A: 1 yuan per person; Grade B: 5 jiao per person; Grade C: 2 jiao per person. Outside the city, the entire project will be done by forced labor. The date of commencement will be determined after the donations are collected. This project is difficult and costly, and the difficulties are numerous. Chen Bingzhang, Wu Shouying, and others carried the plan and budget to the province to personally explain everything to the Construction Department.</p>
<h3>Nantong</h3>
<p>Clearing Up Opium Cases</p>
<p>In the general reinvestigation of opium addiction in Tongyi, a total of 2,387 male and female opium addicts were arrested. Military judges Zhang and Dong of the county government are separately clearing the cases. There are currently 1,812 men and 214 women in custody. It can be concluded in half a month.</p>
<h3>Qingjiang</h3>
<p>Rain and Snow Affect Traffic</p>
<p>Since February 11th, heavy snow has fallen in various parts of Jiangbei, accumulating more than a foot deep, followed by heavy rain, which has not stopped for several days. In addition to the accumulation of several feet of water in the new canal of the guiding Huai River into the sea, which washed away the two earth dikes of the Xiba Wangying, all the motor vehicle highways in the Jiangbei area, such as the Qing (jiang) Yang (zhou), Qing Su (qian), Su (ning), and Qing Shu (yang) lines, were damaged by rain and snow, making it inconvenient for vehicles to travel. Sometimes they get stuck in the mud and it is difficult to pull them out. Therefore, it is difficult to sell tickets for all the lines for a while, which has greatly affected traffic.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Tongyun Adds Diesel Vehicles</p>
<p>Tongyun Long-Distance Bus Company has recently experienced business development, and the original vehicles are insufficient for use. Last year, it purchased six Krupp diesel vehicles from Laihe Foreign Company in Shanghai. After trial use, the results were excellent, and the cost savings were several times greater than gasoline vehicles. The company has recently purchased ten more vehicles from the company, which will be shipped to Ningbo in succession.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Smallpox Epidemic in the City and Township</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been cold and hot, leading to the outbreak of smallpox, which has spread rapidly. Many people have been infected inside and outside the city, such as a girl from the Jiangtiantai tea and paint shop in the central bridge of the city area, a five-year-old child of the Chen Wang family in Wangjia Alley, a young child of Zhang Ayao on Xiheyan, and a five-year-old girl of Liu Asan on the street under the Huilan Bridge outside the East Gate. They all contracted the disease, and due to the lack of timely diagnosis and treatment, they died one after another on the Lantern Festival. In recent days, the epidemic has spread to various villages outside the southeast gate. The county government has specially instructed the town Baos and Jias to publicize and plant cow beans to prevent the spread of the disease.</p>

<h3>The Field Was Wet and Difficult to Handle, Pinghan Lost to Loreal Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lost Two Goals in the First Half, Lost Four More in the Second Half, Cao Qiuting Scored a Goal, Finally Becoming Six to One, The Group is Scheduled to Leave Shanghai at 8:00 AM This Morning and Return to Wuhan</p>
<p>The Pinghan Railway Football Team toured Pingjin during the Lunar New Year and was invincible. This time, it came south with honor and arrived in Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. It planned to challenge the strong Chinese and Western teams in this city, such as Donghua and Fashang. Unexpectedly, at the time of its arrival in Shanghai, the inter-port team had just returned from a long trip, and it was difficult to fight due to the hard journey, so both were politely rejected. Finally, through the mediation of Zhou Jiaqi of the Progressive Association, it was agreed to play against the British army Loreal. The game took place yesterday in Shenyuan, but due to the rain, the football field was saturated with water and was slippery. Only 40% of the seats were sold. Every player on both sides fell like a clay figure of Wuxi, the ball was heavy and wet, and it was difficult to exert footwork, so the game was less exciting. As a result, Pinghan suffered a disastrous defeat of six to one. The whole team is scheduled to take the early express train north at 8:00 am this morning, transfer to the Longhai Road and return to Wuhan. The battle situation yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>Pinghan Kicks Off</p>
<p>First attack, Yan Chengkuan passed the ball forward, Xu Wenkui lifted his foot and shot, but it was a foot off the mark and missed. The British army advanced from the left, and Shabers shot, and it fell from the upper left corner, extremely tricky. Fortunately, Yan Tanghua lightly supported it into a corner kick. At ten minutes, Tefei made a lob shot on the penalty line, and it cut through the crossbar and bounced in. Yan jumped up to block it, and it leaked from his fingertips. The British army</p>
<p>Opened the Score First</p>
<p>Before long, the Pinghan team encountered danger again. When Yan Woluek pushed Tule to shoot from a distance, he couldn't jump up because the ground was slippery, so he was heavily surrounded. Fortunately, he was agile and didn't lose the ball. Then, Chen Zhenxiang took a free kick from 25 yards in front of the enemy's goal, but it was ineffective. Tule crossed, Guan Jiyang lost his footing, and Yan also slipped and fell to the ground. Ottol was just waiting next to him, and he scored the ball into the net. The British army had already</p>
<p>Scored Two Goals in a Row within Thirteen Minutes</p>
<p>After that, Xu Wenkui, Cao Qiuting, and Zhang Jinhai had good opportunities, but they all lost the opportunity because of the difficulty in exerting their footwork. The British army's offensive was extremely strong. Yan Tanghua's business was booming, and his fists and hands waved in all directions, saving many dangerous balls. At the end of the first half, Pinghan was behind by two to zero.</p>
<p>After the Lemon</p>
<p>Pinghan Zhang Dejiang and Cao Qiuting advanced sharply along the left side together, and Yazi failed to stop them. Zhang crossed, and the position was excellent. Mike rushed out to rescue, forming an empty goal, but unfortunately, Cao stepped on the muddy ground and slipped and fell, so Mike</p>
<p>Pinghan Football Team</p>
<p>Easily picked it up. After a stalemate of ten minutes, Shabers shot from the right corner, and Yan was caught in the mud and couldn't save it. He watched the ball bounce in from the right post, making it three to zero. After the center line kicked off, Shabers made another tricky shot, brushing the post. After that, Pinghan changed Cao Qiuting to the right wing, and switched positions with Zhang Dejiang, and there were many opportunities for advancement, but none of them were successful. Soon, Clayton of the British army scored another goal,</p>
<p>Making it Four to Zero</p>
<p>At this time, the British army attacked with all its strength, and the two defenders also crossed the center line. Yan Tanghua's business was booming for a while. At 35 minutes, Cao Qiuting suddenly gained momentum and advanced sharply alone. He shot with force on the penalty line and went in under Mike's armpit. Pinghan finally managed to pull back a goal. Unfortunately, as soon as the joy was over, Tule dribbled past Yin Guan and lightly lobbed it into the net. Soon, Clayton scored another goal in the crowd. Although Pinghan also had two opportunities under the goal, Zhang Dejiang was slightly slower, and Cao Qiuting's footwork was weak, so they lost six to one. The lineup of the Pinghan team is as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Guicheng Zhang Dejiang Guan Jiyang Cao Qiuting Yan Tanghua Chen Zhenxiang Xu Wenkui Yin Zhengda Zhang Jinhai Zhao Qichun Yan Chengkuan</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Ordinary Cup</h3>
<p>South China's Hope is Also High</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 28th) On the 28th, in the Ordinary Cup, the Chinese team played against the Navy. Because the Navy mostly used newcomers, their combat effectiveness was not strong. In the first half, Li Deqi of the Chinese team scored two goals first, but they were invalidated due to being offside. Guo Yingqi then scored a goal, opening the score. In the second half, Li Deqi scored a goal with his head. As a result, the Chinese team won three to zero. In South China played against St. Joseph, and the South team's strong players Lin Depu and Zhuo Shijin were absent and replaced by B team members. Their lineup was not complete, and they tried their best to fight. In the first half, neither side scored. In the second half, both sides won a goal and drew, which was fortunate. In South China played against Jiuhua Club, and Hui Tang was not present and was replaced by Feng Jingxiang as the center forward. The strength was weaker. In the first half, Huang Meishun kicked in a free kick. In the second half, Feng kicked in a corner kick. As a result, South China won two to zero, and the hope of winning the championship increased.</p>
<h3>Monaco International Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Pussekram Wins the Final</p>
<p>(Havas News Agency, Monte Carlo, Monaco, 28th) The international tennis tournament here was held yesterday, and in the men's singles semi-finals, France's first player Pussek defeated Germany's second player Henkel with a score of 6-3, 1-6, 6-4, 6-3.

<h3>Dai Linjing Single-Handedly Leads Donghua to a 4-2 Victory Over Western Police</h3>
<p>Losing by Two Goals in the First Half, Turning Defeat into Victory in the Second Half</p>
<p>This week's Group A matches, originally scheduled for four venues, were disrupted by rain on Saturday. Yesterday's match between Western Merchants and Shaqier was also postponed due to the wet racetrack. Therefore, only the match between Donghua and Western Police proceeded as scheduled at the Municipal Sports Field. As a result, Donghua was at a disadvantage in the first half due to the headwind, losing by two goals. In the second half, they doubled their efforts, with Dai Linjing single-handedly scoring four goals, reversing the situation to win 4-2. Yesterday's morning league match between Jinde and Jews was also postponed due to the closure of Hongkou Park. A brief account of the Donghua vs. Western Police match is as follows:</p>
<p>At the sound of the whistle, Donghua attacked first against the wind. Sun Jinshun was absent due to unforeseen circumstances. About five minutes into the match, Douglas, the center forward of Western Police, advanced with the wind and scored a low shot, catching Zhang Rongcai off guard, and Western Police opened the scoring. Donghua buried their heads in effort, but due to the slippery ground, they struggled to maintain possession, missing opportunities. Before they could recover, Douglas launched another attack, taking advantage of the chaos in front of the goal to score a header. Within fifteen minutes, Western Police had won two goals in a row with an arrogant attitude. Donghua strictly directed its members, striving to advance. The situation indeed changed, and good opportunities arose repeatedly. However, due to the headwind, they repeatedly missed opportunities. The first half ended with a 0-2 deficit.</p>
<p>After the lemon break, Donghua calmly responded. Just six minutes into the second half, Dai Linjing received a brilliant pass from Qian Jingyong and scored, pulling back a goal. Five minutes later, they got a penalty opportunity. Dai executed it again, tying the score at 2-2 in an instant. Donghua's momentum grew stronger, and their attack intensified. In the nineteenth minute, as Mei Enzheng held the ball, Donghua formed an encirclement. However, Turner kicked someone, resulting in another penalty kick. Dai Linjing calmly completed the task, making it 3-1, and Donghua took the lead from then on. Although Western Police tried their best to counterattack, the situation was ultimately controlled by Donghua. Finally, in the last three or four minutes before the end of the match, Dai Linjing used his left foot to shoot a low shot into the left corner under the goal, scoring again and reversing the victory with a score of 4-2.</p>
<h3>The Industrial and Commercial Football Final Between Jinde and Changgeng Ended Disagreeably</h3>
<p>Spectators Rushed onto the Field, Causing Disorder; The Committee Will Resolve the Outcome</p>
<p>The eighth Industrial and Commercial Football Competition at the Municipal No. 1 Sports Field saw the final between the Jinde and Changgeng teams of the "Shen" group. Having previously tied in the championship match, they rescheduled for a rematch, which was postponed twice due to rain. It was not until 10:00 AM yesterday that the final was played again. Citizens were impressed by the past performances of the two teams, and more than 3,000 people went to watch. At the beginning of the match, the forces were very even, and there was no progress. Later, Jinde's front line took the opportunity to advance, and right inside forward Huang Zhenhe shot in a goal. Not long after the start of the second half, Changgeng's right winger Yang Wenhui also scored a goal, resulting in a tie. Afterwards, Jinde's offensive was quite fierce, but Changgeng's defense was very strong, and Jinde's forwards ultimately failed to succeed. When time ran out without a winner, the match was extended by twenty minutes according to the rules. In the first ten minutes, neither side showed superiority, but Jinde's right winger Huang Zhenhe (who changed positions at the start of the second half) and Changgeng's left halfback Jin Jiabiao fell to the ground together while fighting for the ball. At that time, a Jinde player was penalized for being offside, and the ball had already been kicked out by the Changgeng team. In the process, Huang Zhenhe, who was lying on the ground, touched Jin Jiabiao's face with his foot. The two sides almost broke out in anger, but it was quickly resolved. In the last ten minutes, the teams switched sides and fought again. Due to the excessive number of spectators, people gradually squeezed into the bamboo fence, and the order was not as good as before. Less than two minutes into the match, Jinde's left forward Wang Yishan stepped on the foot of Changgeng's right forward Hu Hanwen. The referee immediately blew the whistle to penalize Wang Yishan, but Hu Hanwen kicked Wang Yishan. At that time, a spectator rushed onto the field and chased after Wang Yishan. The crowd also rushed onto the field, with some shouting to hit and others trying to dissuade. The entire field was in chaos, and the match could not continue. It is said that the referee will report the facts to the committee, which will resolve the matter at a meeting.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Post Office to Collect Income Tax</h3>
<p>Interest on Deposits and Loans Allowed to Offset for Calculation</p>
<p>The collection of Shanghai's income tax was originally handled by the Shanghai Central Bank. In recent days, over a thousand people have been paying their taxes at the Central Bank daily, causing severe congestion. Moreover, Shanghai is vast, and taxpayers who live far from the Central Bank find the journey inconvenient. Therefore, the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance requested the Central Bank to consult with the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. It has been agreed that, from March 1st of this year, thirty designated post offices in Shanghai will also collect income tax. Taxpayers can now pay their taxes at the nearest post office, avoiding congestion and travel. As for credit accounts between banks, money houses, and firms, if an account (referring to a single passbook) has both deposits and loans, the deposit interest and loan interest should be allowed to offset each other when calculating interest. However, if they are not in the same account, offsetting is not allowed. The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Department has already issued an interpretation to this effect and sent letters to the Bankers Association to inform all banks, money houses, and firms.</p>
<h3>Fishery Syndicate to be Established Today</h3>
<p>First Board Meeting to be Convened</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's Fishery Syndicate is scheduled to be established today, and the first board meeting will be convened at 10:00 AM. The meeting will elect executive directors, managers, and assistant managers, and discuss business plans. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Official and Merchant Directors</p>
<p>The syndicate's board of directors, as stipulated in the articles of association, consists of nineteen members: seven from the government and twelve from the commercial sector. The government has appointed Yu Zhenyong, Qian Xinzhi, Gui Yanfang, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Yuanshan, and Zhang Yijun.

There will be seven executive directors, with the government designating Xu Xingliu and Yu Zhenyong. The commercial executive directors will be mutually elected by the other directors. The Ministry of Industry has appointed Yan Shenyu as the supervising officer.</p>
<p>Meeting Agenda</p>
<p>Today's establishment will not involve a ceremony. Instead, the first board meeting will be held at 10:00 AM at the syndicate's office on the fourth floor of The New China Bank. Minister of Industry Wu Dingchang is unable to come to Shanghai, and has sent a telegram designating Vice Minister Zhou Yichun to represent him and provide guidance. The meeting agenda is as follows: A) Formalities; B) Opening remarks by the Chairman of the Board; C) Instructions from the Vice Minister of the Ministry of Industry; D) Report by the preparatory staff on the preparatory process; E) Discussion items: 1) Mutual election of five executive directors; 2) Confirmation of the candidates for manager and assistant manager; 3) Ratification of the regulations submitted by the preparatory office for filing; 4) Approval of the syndicate's budget; 5) Determination of the syndicate's business plan. It is reported that the contract will be passed in the meeting, and then the first year's contract between the syndicate and each bank will be signed.</p>
<p>Loan Disbursement to Begin</p>
<p>The syndicate has decided to begin disbursing loans before the spring fishing season. The application process will be kept as simple as possible. Detailed regulations will be included in the loan disbursement charter, which will be released after approval by the board of directors. The loan recipients will primarily be fishermen who are direct producers, avoiding lending through fish merchants. Cash payments and receipts will be implemented. However, if it is necessary to temporarily use fish merchants, flexible arrangements will still be made to gradually improve the system. The scope of the loans will initially focus on the investigated production areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and will then be gradually expanded to other areas.</p>
<p>Allocation of Funds</p>
<p>The syndicate's total capital is one million yuan, divided into fixed and circulating capital. The Ministry of Industry will contribute 200,000 yuan of fixed capital, which has been allocated to The New China Bank, China Joint Savings Bank and Four Banks Joint Savings Society for storage. The 800,000 yuan of circulating capital will be contributed by twelve banks: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Yien Yieh Commercial Bank, Bank of Shanghai, China &amp; South Sea Bank, The Continental Bank, Ningpo Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, The New China Bank, China Joint Savings Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Four Banks Joint Savings Society. Contracts will be signed with the syndicate, stipulating interest payment methods. These will be officially signed after approval by the board of directors. The method for each bank to contribute circulating capital will be based on an allocation system. For example, if the board of directors approves a loan of 100,000 yuan for a certain area, each participating bank will be notified to allocate funds proportionally based on their capital contribution. The funds contributed by each bank will not be pooled in one place to be allocated by the syndicate.</p>
<p>Investigation of Production Areas</p>
<p>The syndicate attaches great importance to investigating production areas. Design committee member Qu Junyuan and investigator Cao Erwei have visited Shengsi Islands, Zhoushan Archipelago, and Jinshanwei to investigate the economic conditions of fishermen. Detailed reports on production have been provided to the syndicate for reference. It has now been decided that after the syndicate is established, a research department will be established under the syndicate to continue investigating the coastal fisheries of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and other coastal provinces as a reference for loan disbursement.</p>

<h3>Real Estate Association Convened Executive and Supervisory Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>Strenuously Opposing Road Building Beyond Boundaries, House Tax, and Water Price Increase</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that the Shanghai Real Estate Association convened a joint meeting of executives and supervisors yesterday to discuss how to respond to members' strong opposition to the water price increase and the Municipal Council's forceful demand that property owners be responsible for paying house tax in areas beyond the settlement boundaries. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>House Tax</p>
<p>The Real Estate Association received a joint letter from members of the Mainland Bank Trust Department, the China Industrial Bank Leasing Department, the Ken Yieh Bank Real Estate Department, the Zhongyi Trust Co., Ltd. Trust Department, the Youcheng Leasing Account Office, and the Hekun Company, stating: "We hereby inform you that, with regard to the properties in the areas beyond the settlement boundaries, many tenants have not paid the house tax, and the Municipal Council is forcefully demanding that the property owners be responsible for payment, threatening to block the drainage ditches and cesspools. We have investigated whether this district's house tax should be paid to the Shanghai Municipal Government or the Concession authorities. This matter concerns police power, and property owners and tenants are in a difficult position. Moreover, if property owners are forced to be responsible for recognizing the tax, this will increase their losses. Considering the principles of law and human nature, and in light of the current decline in the real estate industry, property owners should not bear undue responsibility and losses. Members have limited properties in areas beyond the settlement boundaries, and it is difficult to deal with this situation alone. Therefore, we request that your association convene an urgent meeting as soon as possible to request instructions from the Shanghai Municipal Government and to find ways to negotiate with the Concession authorities. We also hope that you will request the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to uphold justice. We hope for the best."</p>
<p>Water Price</p>
<p>The Association convened a joint meeting of executives and supervisors at its meeting hall on Shanxi Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than ten people attended, including Shen Tianxin, Shen Lianfang, Zhou Weishi, Xu Xiajun, Shen Jixuan, Li Bohan, and Wu Shutian. Shen Tianhua presided, and Shi Cizhou recorded the minutes. After formalities and an opening speech by the chairman, the following proposals were discussed: 1) The British Shanghai Waterworks Company announced that, starting this month, the water price discount will be changed from 25% to 20%. Members have sent letters expressing their opposition, requesting the Association to conduct earnest negotiations. How should this be handled? (Resolution) Send a letter to the British Concession Municipal Council to negotiate, to achieve the goal of cancellation. 2) Members of the Mainland Bank, Qian Yiru and others, sent a letter stating that, for properties in areas beyond the settlement boundaries, many tenants have not paid house tax, and the Municipal Council is forcefully demanding that property owners be responsible for payment. Should this district's house tax be paid to the Shanghai Municipal Government or the Municipal Council? Please negotiate with the authorities. (Resolution) Submit the situation to the Municipal Government and the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, and request them to negotiate with the Municipal Council with reason. The meeting adjourned around 6:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Yan Esheng Discusses Income Tax: All Businesses Should Expedite Filings</h3>
<p>Deadline for Capital and Deposit Declarations Has Passed. Merchants and Citizens Should Support the Good Tax System and Act Quickly</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that, according to the Ministry of Finance's regulations, the deadline for income tax capital and deposit declarations is the end of February. However, many companies and businesses are still unclear about the filing procedures, and are inquiring with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Yan Esheng, secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, reported on the following:</p>
<p>Capital Declaration</p>
<p>The procedure for declaring capital is very simple. If the amount of capital has not changed since the business was established, it can be reported according to the original capital amount. If there has been a change, it can be reported according to the changed amount. Subsequent changes can still be reported at any time and are not subject to any restrictions. As for merchants requesting that public reserves be included in the capital calculation, this is currently under consideration by the Income Tax Office. It is generally expected to be adopted, but it is not necessary to include public reserves in the current declaration. Declaring capital is one issue, and including public reserves in the capital calculation in the future is another issue. Since there is no public reserve item on the capital declaration form, public reserves can be temporarily omitted.</p>
<p>Deposit Declaration</p>
<p>Deposit declaration is a preparation for the collection of income tax on deposit interest and has no other purpose. Previously, various trade associations suspected that other problems would arise after reporting, because the Ministry of Finance had issued an order to crack down on stores with insufficient deposit funds. This was a misunderstanding. The Ministry of Finance is cracking down on stores that set up deposit departments under that name to absorb cash and solicit savings deposits publicly. Store deposits are nothing more than deposits from the store owner's partners and relatives, which are neither savings deposits nor publicly solicited, and are therefore not within the scope of the crackdown. Moreover, the current deposit declaration form only lists three items: deposit type, number of accounts, and total deposit amount. Since there is no need to fill in and report each account individually, there should be no concerns. As for income from deposit interest, the banking industry deducts a 1/1000 handling fee, so only 4/1000 is actually paid (according to regulations, it should be 5/1000). Store deposits can be handled in the same way in the future. The Shanghai Office of the Income Tax Office's Notice No. 4 also mentions deducting income tax according to the general method for the banking industry. The Chamber of Commerce has sent another letter to the office to seek further clarification in order to be more explicit.</p>
<p>Explanation of Penalties</p>
<p>Declaring capital and declaring deposits are obligations that citizens and merchants should fulfill to support the government's implementation of a good tax system. Therefore, even though the deadline has passed, it must still be expedited. There should be leeway for delays of a few days due to procedural reasons. However, merchants who suspect that they will be subject to a fine of up to 20 yuan under Article 18 of the Provisional Regulations are also mistaken. The penalty under Article 18 refers to reporting the amount of income as stipulated in the regulations, and does not refer to reporting the amount of capital as stipulated in the implementing rules, let alone reporting deposits, which is not stipulated in either the regulations or the implementing rules. However, even though the penalty does not apply, merchants and citizens should still enthusiastically declare. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce also distributes these declaration forms and can be requested. If there are any doubts, you can inquire or refer to the Chamber of Commerce's Explanation of Income Tax Regulations.</p>

<h3>Second Special District Citizens' Joint Association Notice</h3>
<p>Establishment of Income Tax Declaration Agency</p>
<p>The Second Special District Citizens' Joint Association of the French Concession has established an income tax declaration agency to facilitate income tax declarations for businesses within the district. Accountant He Yuanming has been invited to provide guidance and handle income tax declaration procedures entrusted by various businesses. The notice is as follows: "Our country's income tax has been implemented since January 1st of this year.

The declaration date has been announced as February 28th of this year. The procedures are quite complicated, and there are many penalties. At the beginning of the implementation of this income tax, the general public may not be familiar with the calculation methods and declaration procedures. If there is any negligence, the losses will be great. This association has set up an income tax declaration agency at 434 Avenue Dubail and invited accountant He Yuanming to provide guidance to facilitate the companies and businesses.

This action is a disruption of public order, and the Shanghai Grand Theater is located in a section of road built beyond the settlement boundaries, within the scope of our country's police power. Now this unfortunate incident has occurred, which is particularly distressing. The "Abyssinia" film has also been solemnly reviewed by our authorities. How can the sovereignty be disregarded and unwarranted interference be added? We hereby petition your association to forward the petition to the Municipal Government for immediate negotiations. We hope to achieve the goal of compensation and punishing the perpetrators, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, to protect sovereignty and maintain public security. We respectfully submit the petition."</p>

<h3>A Group of Children Does Not Know How to Divide Property</h3>
<p>Crying Loudly in the Waiting Room, Laughing in the Courtroom</p>
<p>Qiao Zhiqing, a deceased local resident of No. 9, Yonghua Lane, Fushan Tang Street, Xiaonanmen, was engaged in the barge business and owned eight barges, accumulating considerable wealth. His first wife bore a daughter, who married a Xu and is known as Xu Qiao, aged 33, and a son named Qiao Chunsheng, aged 30. He remarried a Lu, who bore seven children, including Qiao Suzhen, aged 21, married to a Hu; Qiao Xiuzhen, aged 18; Qiao Fengzhen, aged 14; Qiao Huizhen, aged 13; Qiao Linsheng, aged 15; Qiao Fusheng, aged 10; and one younger child. Ms. Lu was able to transform into a kind stepmother, treating the children of the first wife better than her own, and the children of the first wife were grateful for her. Unfortunately, Qiao Zhiqing died of illness in July of the 23rd year, and Ms. Lu also passed away on December 19 of the 25th year. According to custom, the inheritance was managed by Qiao Chunsheng. However, Chunsheng, often bothered by his older sister Xu Qiao, filed a complaint with the local court requesting that the father's inheritance, valued at 11,580 yuan, be divided into nine shares, and stated that he was willing to waive the inheritance of his stepmother. The day before yesterday, Judge Wang opened the court. Before the court session began, the sisters and brothers were hugging each other in the waiting room, crying and scolding Qiao Chunsheng for being heartless. During the court hearing, Qiao Chunsheng stated that because the sisters and brothers were fighting for power after the parents' death, he would inevitably be accused of embezzlement in the future, so it was better to divide the property earlier. Xu Qiao and Hu Qiao Suzhen stated that they were already married and did not want to divide the property, and were willing to waive their share, but the younger siblings were young and Chunsheng was away from home and no one was taking care of them, so they were arguing with him. At this point, Qiao Linsheng, Qiao Fengzhen, Qiao Huizhen, and Qiao Fusheng were called to the stand. It was a group of children crying loudly in the waiting room, but after entering the courtroom, they were innocent and cheerful, laughing. The question officer could not help but cover his mouth and laugh. Judge Wang then said to Qiao Chun, "Your younger siblings are all children. You should designate a guardian for them so that they can be interrogated and judged." The case was postponed for two weeks.</p>
<h3>Disturbance in Longhua Town Over Demolition of Houses and Construction of Fences</h3>
<p>Over a Hundred Men, Women, and Children Flock to the Police Station to Petition</p>
<p>In front of the temple grounds in Longhua Town, West Shanghai, the temple has over eighty city-owned houses, with monthly rent totaling over two hundred yuan, all collected by the monks. Later, Monk Yuanzhao mortgaged the house land to someone. After Yuanzhao left due to an incident, Lu Maotou and another nephew of the temple owner Lu Mingzhao took over the collection. However, recently, due to the sluggish market, business has been slow for various shops, and there have been rent arrears. Lu and others, unable to collect rent, secretly signed an agreement with the temple abbot, planning to demolish and rebuild the houses in order to increase rent and collect deposits. The afternoon before yesterday, Lu and others hired several bamboo craftsmen to build fences. The tenants learned of this and believed that with the annual incense season approaching, forcing them to relocate would be tantamount to sentencing hundreds of people to death. Therefore, they rose up in opposition, and in a short time, over a hundred men, women, and children gathered and flocked to the town police station, requesting that the police be sent to stop the construction. Luo, the chief of the Caojing Police Station, upon receiving the report, feared that an incident would occur and immediately ordered Officer Zhang to go and persuade the crowd to disperse. The tenants then elected representatives Yu Xiaochun and Xu Shiqin to request Officer Zhang to stop the construction first and to send elected representatives to petition the municipal government and other agencies for relief.</p>
<h3>Lake Society Schedules Talk on the Yongxin Shipwreck Tragedy</h3>
<p>Petitioning the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Authorities to Suspend Yongshun Shipping Operations; Investigating Whether the Cause of the Accident Was Non-Compliance with Regulations</p>
<p>Since the Yongxin shipwreck tragedy, the Lake Society has sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations, published notices to collect information on the victims' families and the facts of the disaster, made tables for registration, and sent letters to the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau and the Wuxing County Government to investigate the details of the disaster. Responses from various parties have been received successively. Meanwhile, documents were prepared and submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that Yongshun Inland Steamship Company be ordered to cease operations and that the Xin Yong'an and Yongxin vessels be detained pending resolution of the case. It is now scheduled to convene a meeting of the families of the victims at the Society on the afternoon of March 7, and letters have been sent to the Wuxing and Wujiang county governments and the Pingwang Public Security Bureau to send personnel to attend. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Investigation of the Cause Regarding the details of the disaster, various newspapers have already published reports. Now, the Society has received investigation reports from the Wujiang and Wuxing county governments and the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau, which unanimously stated that the cause of the accident was indeed improper loading, careless navigation, and non-compliance with the regulations of the Maritime Affairs Bureau. The Maritime Affairs Bureau's investigation report stated that the Yongxin vessel departed from Huzhou at 7:00 AM on the 3rd of this month, having sold eighty-four tickets. The ship's awning and front and rear cabins were loaded with ten buckets of fresh ice, over ten loads of white rice, over nine hundred bolts of Huzhou silk, and over eighty pieces of luggage, resulting in excessive load and improper loading, with the upper part being heavy and the lower part light. It was determined that the ship's hull and machinery were not damaged beforehand, indicating that the accident was clearly due to a loss of balance.</p>
<p>Request for Strict Handling After the Lake Society published notices to collect information on the victims' families and the facts of the disaster, the families reported everything to the Society, especially regarding the company's responsible personnel who failed to provide immediate rescue after the accident, disregarding the lives of dozens of passengers and lacking conscience, expressing extreme anger and requesting the Society to uphold justice and provide assistance. After receiving the report, the Society submitted it to the 32nd regular meeting of the 13th session, deciding to first submit it to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that Yongshun's operations be ordered to cease and that the Xin Yong'an and Yongxin vessels be detained. According to a reply telegram from Chairman Zhu of the Zhejiang Provincial Government, it was approved to send a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for investigation and strict handling.</p>
<p>Joint Negotiation</p>
<p>The Wujiang Native Place Association in Shanghai, regarding the Yongxin tragedy, felt that it was a matter of local concern and could not stand idly by. They sent a letter to the Lake Society Committee stating that the total loss and number of deaths after the sinking of the Yongxin ship was an unprecedented tragedy in the history of inland navigation. The association felt that it was a matter of local concern and could not stand idly by. A temporary standing committee meeting was convened, and a telegram was sent to the Wujiang County authorities to handle the matter carefully. The association planned to negotiate with the Yongshun Company jointly with your Society to comfort the departed souls. What should be done? Please advise.</p>
<p>Lake Society Notice The Lake Society issued a special notice yesterday, inviting the families of the victims to attend a discussion meeting. The notice stated, "We are writing to inform you that regarding the tragic accident of the Yongxin steamship, our Society has dispatched staff to conduct separate investigations. We have prepared and issued registration forms for the families to fill out and report the facts of the disaster. Documents have been prepared and submitted to the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces and the Shanghai Municipal Government, requesting that the Yongshun Inland Steamship Company be ordered to cease operations and that the Xin Yong'an and Yongxin vessels be detained pending resolution of the case. In accordance with the requests of the families of the victims, who have sent letters requesting that justice be upheld, it is now scheduled to convene a discussion meeting with the families of the victims of the Yongxin disaster at our Society at 3:00 PM on the afternoon of March 7. We hope that you will attend on time, express your views, and discuss solutions. We eagerly anticipate your presence."</p>
<h3>Case of Assaulting a Police Officer Witness Being Humiliated</h3>
<p>Perpetrator Released, Gathering Crowd for Revenge</p>
<p>Diao Liyou from Tongzhou was detained by the First Special District Court for assaulting a police officer around December 15th of last year. Sun A-si from Qingjiang testified in court, leading to a sentence of 25 days of detention. After his release, Diao harbored extreme resentment towards Sun. On February 18th, at 5:30 PM, near the intersection of Gongping Road and Tangshan Road, he encountered Sun. He then gathered a group including Hou Daoan and others and, without asking any questions, beat him up and dragged him into a public bathhouse (老虎灶). They stripped Sun of two short shirts and one pair of trousers, which they pawned for two yuan in legal tender. The case was discovered by Chinese detective Wu De Kui, who sent Diao and Hou to the Third Criminal Court for interrogation and detention of accomplices. Yesterday, Judge Xiao Xie Fen continued the trial in court. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the Public Works Department, stated that as the accomplices could not be apprehended, he requested severe punishment. The plaintiff, Sun A-si, stated that he witnessed six vagrants helping the two defendants extort money inside the public bathhouse. When questioned, the two defendants gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao sentenced Diao Liyou and Hou Daoan to one year and six months of imprisonment each as a warning.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of Their Peculiar Shapes</p>
<p>When a reporter from Datong News Agency visited yesterday morning, the seals were basking in the sun on the stone steps by the pool. Suddenly, one leaped into the water, swimming very fast and diving underwater. Remarkably, when they enter the water, small flaps cover their ears and noses, allowing them to stay in the water for long periods without seawater entering.</p>
<p>Two to be Shipped to Germany</p>
<p>According to Director Shen of the zoo, the seals originate from the North Pacific region and prefer to live in groups. When in the ocean, they are usually led by brave males. If raised for a long time, they can recognize their owners, showing great intelligence. These seals are all owned by Dingxingtai Bird and Animal Store. One of them has been generously donated to the zoo by the store, while the other two have been purchased by German expatriates and will soon be shipped to zoos in that country for display.</p>

He served as the principal of Ningbo High School, Ningbo Middle School, and the Ningbo Association in Shanghai. His morality and writing were highly respected by the people of Ningbo for a long time.

<h3>Explosion of Water-Heater in Shanghai Bank</h3>
<p>Two Dead, One Injured, Cook Foreman Detained</p>
<p>A tragic water-heater explosion occurred at the head office of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank at 50 Ningbo Road at around 6:00 AM yesterday. One person was killed on the spot, one person was injured, and one person was crushed to death. The water-heater room of the bank is located in the lower level of a cement building behind the Shanghai Bank Building on Jiangxi Road. Cooks Xu Zulin, Wang Caijin, Zhang Jinlong, and others were hired to specialize in this task. In addition, Zhu Fenglan and Xu Jiarui were hired as assistants. Wang, Zhang, and Xu worked in three shifts each day, managing three steam boilers. Zhang Jinlong was on the early shift yesterday, and Zhu Fenglan and Xu Jiarui were also assisting on the shift. Unexpectedly, the steam gauge on the boiler was leaking, which was not noticed at the time. Zhang and others, seeing that the water gauge had not risen, thought that the temperature might not be sufficient, so they doubled the amount of coal and started the fire, causing the temperature to exceed the pressure without being noticed. As a result, after a short while, an explosion occurred. Zhang Jinlong was quick to dodge and was not harmed. Xu Jiarui burned his right hand. However, Zhu Fenglan, being directly in the path of the explosion, was burned to death. At the same time, the lower-level cement ceiling was also blasted into a dome, directly piercing the boiler room on the first floor. The east-facing wall collapsed due to the shock. At that time, a garbage collector from Jiangbei, Pan Weihan, happened to be sweeping garbage next to the garbage can by the wall. Unable to escape, he was crushed under the wall bricks and rubble. By the time he was pulled out, he was already dead. At that time, the Central Police Station and the Central Fire Brigade also received the news and rushed to the scene to handle the aftermath immediately. They first sent the injured to the hospital for treatment and then transported the bodies of the deceased to the autopsy center to await examination. Afterwards, the police station summoned Wang Caijin, the foreman of the boiler room, for questioning. Fortunately, yesterday was Sunday, and the accident occurred at dawn. The bank's office staff had not yet arrived, and other than the dead and injured workers in the boiler room, there were no other casualties. It was indeed a great fortune within misfortune.</p>

It is estimated that before March 15th, the plan on how to settle will be announced to the creditors, and the creditors will be given the opportunity to raise objections.

<h3>Postal Knowledge Q&amp;A (12)</h3>
<p>Question: I have several relatives living in the countryside inland. Every month, I purchase postal money orders from the post office, seal them in registered letters, and send them. After the recipient receives them, they entrust someone to take the money order to the local money order exchange post office in a nearby city to collect the money. However, the recipient is an elderly woman who cannot sign her name and has no seal. It is not inconvenient to find a guarantor in the countryside when receiving registered letters. However, when taking the ticket to the city to exchange money, difficulties often arise due to the seal and guarantor issues. I recently saw in the 10th issue of the Q&amp;A compiled by your company, regarding a section on mail held for collection at the post office, that "it is best for the recipient to use a postal identity certificate to prove their identity when collecting the mail to simplify the process." Since the postal identity certificate can be used as proof for collecting mail held for collection, can all registered mail and postal remittances also be delivered based on this identity certificate, without requiring the recipient to sign or seal separately? Also, what does the identity certificate look like, where can it be obtained, and what are the procedures? Please provide details.</p>
<p>Answer: Postal identity certificates are issued by post offices in various countries in accordance with the provisions of the International Postal Convention, specifically for certificate holders to collect mail, exchange remittances, and prove that they are the same person when conducting other business with the post office. The identity certificates issued by the Chinese Post Office are sold by the postal administrations in each district. Any citizen of the country who is 20 years old or older can purchase them. Each certificate costs 50 cents in national currency, which is indicated by a postage stamp affixed inside the certificate. The certificate is rectangular, made of sturdy thin cardstock, folded into two pages. The cover contains the words "International Postal Union, Republic of China Post Office" in Chinese and French, as well as three French articles as follows: "1. This certificate is used as proof that the certificate holder is the same person in postal business matters. 2. This certificate is issued exclusively by the post office and is valid for three years. If the appearance of the certificate holder changes during the validity period, causing it to be inconsistent with the photo or description inside the certificate, a new certificate must be replaced. 3. The post office is not responsible for any disputes arising from the loss or theft of this certificate by others." The back of the certificate indicates the certificate holder's facial features, and the first page inside the certificate is signed by the certificate holder, their half-length photo is pasted, and a postmark is stamped on the top of the seam, and a 50-cent postage stamp is pasted on the bottom, and the post office date stamp is affixed. The second page records the certificate holder's name and address, signed by the post office director of the issuing post office and stamped with the date stamp. However, this identity certificate is a kind of proof for the certificate holder to replace the guarantor for receiving mail and remittances. For mail and remittance payments that require receipts to be drawn, the certificate holder should still sign and seal the relevant receipt and money order, and present the identity certificate at the same time to prove that they are the same person, so that the post office can deliver the item in accordance with the regulations when there is any doubt about the seal or signature, as the identity certificate is available as proof. In short, for receiving mail and remittances with receipts, the postal identity certificate and signature seal are complementary and are not used as a replacement for signature seal. Moreover, when purchasing the identity certificate, the certificate holder must also sign and seal inside the certificate and in the special register prepared by the post office. Therefore, this identity certificate is not very suitable for people who cannot sign their names or have no seals. As for the situation you described, the post office has another remedy, that is, if the amount of the remittance you send is between one yuan and twenty yuan and has no odd numbers, you can use a small amount money order (now called a agency money order) remitted to the postal agency near the countryside where the recipient lives, which is more convenient to exchange. The procedure for purchasing a small amount money order is roughly the same as for an ordinary money order, but the envelope for sealing the money order and registered letter is supplied by the post office that remits the money, and the remitter seals the small amount money order and the registered letter together on the spot and hands them over to the bureau for mailing. After arrival, the recipient only needs to personally or entrust someone to take the envelope together with the small amount money order to the designated nearby postal agency to exchange money based on the envelope, without signing or sealing the money order. For detailed information, you can inquire at the post office's remittance window.</p>

<h3>Research on Improving Village and Field Appearance (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Niu Yongjian</p>
<p>— Lecture at Yutang People's Education Center —</p>
<p>The above are all driven primarily by ambition and diligence. Other necessary tools, spare time, and financial resources are by no means difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned plan for improving the appearance of villages and fields only addresses the most urgent, simple, and practical aspects of tidiness, cleanliness, hygiene, and aesthetics. If even these cannot be addressed, then China will not be a civilized country. There is no need to discuss various constructions, nor can we talk about abolishing unequal treaties. Therefore, the above items must be completed first. Other matters that take more time, money, and tools, as well as undertakings that require vast financial resources and advanced academic knowledge, and necessary constructions, can be carried out in the second stage.</p>
<p>The improvement of village and field appearance is something that people in various countries around the world almost automatically devote themselves to, in order to strive for the glory of their country. In places with lower cultures, such as emerging countries or colonies, it is also necessary to rely on the supervision of police officers and the guidance of teachers to strive for this goal in order to survive in the human world. In Asia, such as Japan, Siam, Annam, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, etc., wherever we go, we see tidiness, cleanliness, hygiene, and aesthetics, which can prove this.</p>
<p>Since we recognize that the key to improving the appearance of villages and fields lies in education, youth, and local autonomy, we hope that colleagues in the education sector will promote social guidance organizations to provide scientific and common-sense practical enlightenment on various aspects of village and field appearance, so that people can easily understand; on the other hand, autonomous organizations should add training on tidying up villages and fields when training autonomous personnel: and attach the task of tidying up villages and fields to the training, so as to act as police officers on behalf of village autonomy and practically supervise and correct various matters of village and field improvement; in particular, we hope that the heads of autonomous organizations will use their legal powers to strictly monitor, diligently implement, and distinguish between urgent and easy matters, set deadlines, implement reforms, and ensure that the sights of filth, disorder, dilapidation, and decay no longer occur in our Shanghai county, gradually spreading to the entire province and the entire country, so that our Chinese nation will not be despised by the world, and the local benefits obtained will also be significant.

<h3>Seven Robbers, Male and Female, Caught on Bansongyuan Road</h3>
<p>Attempted Robbery Thwarted, Arrests Made First, Two Box Cannons Also Confiscated</p>
<p>Around 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Qian Daxiong, captain of the Sixth Squad of the Shanghai Police Bureau's Detective Brigade, received a tip-off that a gang of robbers was planning to rob a certain family at No. 182, Bansongyuan Road, Nanshi. After receiving the report, Captain Qian immediately reported to Brigade Commander Liu Huai, ordering him to lead squad leader Liu Bingyuan and all detectives, dressed in disguise, to Bansongyuan Road and its vicinity to lie in ambush. Before long, the gang of robbers arrived one after another. After being identified by the informant, the detectives gave a signal and swarmed out. The bandits were unable to resist and were captured on the spot, including seven men and women. However, some suspects may be among them. Two box cannons were seized from the hands of two robbers, each with eight live rounds in the magazine, and they were taken to the team. According to the confessions of the robbers, (1) Zhang Changfa, age 40, (2) Zhang Haiqing, age 28, (3) Gao Huaixin, age 28, (4) Xu Bangquan, age 29, (5) Wang Sen, age 29, (6) Jin Huaqing, age 30, and (7) a woman named Chuan Shishi, age 56. Among them, except for Wang, who is from Dantu, and Jin, who is from Wuhu, the rest all confessed to being from Anhui. The two box cannons were seized from Zhang Changfa and Wang Sen. According to the confessions of the robbers, they robbed Wang Dechang's family on Zhongxing Road, Zhabei, in January of this year. The team considered the case important, so they immediately escorted them to the Detective Brigade for questioning. Currently, they are being investigated for any other robberies they may have committed, and the remaining gang members are being pursued. Once the investigation is clear, they will be transferred to the Third Section for disposal.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>Sichuan's Finances and Economy Over the Past Two Years</h3>
<p>— Gan Cishen</p>
<p>Since the suppression of the Red Army concluded and the new Sichuan Provincial Government was established (February of the 24th year of the Republic), the overall situation in Sichuan Province has ostensibly transitioned from a chaotic and complex phase to a clear and unified state. The establishment of fiscal budgets, promotion of production and construction, and implementation of abolishing some harsh and miscellaneous taxes along with rural relief are all highly optimistic signs. However, the substance of these phenomena may still be viewed with suspicion, and the degree to which they satisfy is not immediate. Friends who have traveled or investigated in Sichuan Province often bring back extremely different and contradictory impressions. This may be a reflection of this phenomenon. Now that the 25th year of the Republic has passed, and the new administration in Sichuan Province has been in place for a full two years, discussing the current state of Sichuan's finances and economy at this time may be something those who care about Sichuan affairs would like to hear.</p>
<p>㊀ A Finance Barely Making Ends Meet</p>
<p>I remember that a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao once criticized the current state of Sichuan's finances as moving from "having wealth without governance" to "harsh but not disruptive" (Note 1). This statement is not at all an exaggeration. Before the 24th year of the Republic, Sichuan Province was in a state of warlord separatism, where the collection of all taxes and the expenditure of all funds were based solely on the will of the local military and political leaders. There was no budget, nor a fixed tax rate. Due to the squandering of funds by the military personnel themselves and the needs of war, the people's burden was constantly increasing. Land taxes were pre-collected up to the 70th or 80th year of the Republic, and commodity taxes exceeded their original value by one or two times, which can be said to have been "commonplace" at that time.</p>
<p>The result of this endless plunder was rural bankruptcy, obstruction of commerce, and all sorts of unbearable and distressing situations. Therefore, when the new provincial government was established in February of the 24th year of the Republic, the government immediately took "renewal with the people" as its slogan, announced new laws for reorganizing taxes, and compiled the budget for the 24th year of the Republic.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Sichuan Province fiscal budget for the 24th year of the Republic was quite difficult because, on the one hand, it had to consider the people's burden, and on the other hand, there were huge military expenditures. Under these difficult circumstances, the government had no choice but to sacrifice the former and adopt the so-called temporary military expense collection method during the bandit suppression period, replacing the previous pre-collection. The collection of temporary military expenses was based on adding three times the land tax as temporary military expenses. In other words, land tax had to be collected four times a year. This method naturally reduced the burden considerably in places where the collection had been very harsh in the past. However, in places where the extraction was lighter in the past, it was much heavier than before. Calculated on a provincial average, the amount of income can be said to have had no increase or decrease. As for taxes, the laws and regulations promulgated by the government were intended to eliminate the previous harsh and miscellaneous taxes and implement a unified tax system. However, the tax rate of the unified tax system was not lighter than the sum of the harsh and miscellaneous taxes added together. Although this reduced the pain that merchants had previously suffered from being held up at checkpoints, in terms of burden, it was no different. It is no wonder that a reporter from the Ta Kung Pao criticized it as "harsh but not disruptive," and the author could not help but righteously and indignantly condemn this method in another article as "ineffective by relying solely on lip service." (Note 2)</p>
<p>Although the tax measures did not reduce the burden on the people, the result of their implementation in terms of income was that the area affected by natural disasters and banditry expanded, and land tax revenues decreased. Furthermore, the central government held unified taxes, and local taxes on imported goods such as cotton yarn and cigarettes were suspended, further reducing income. On the expenditure side, military expenses, which were unavoidable, were often outside the budget. This meant that the budget balance that the government had painstakingly created had to be disrupted. According to official figures, the revenue and expenditure deficit for the first nine months of the 24th year of the Republic reached a huge 15 million yuan!</p>
<p>The government did not lack ways to make up for this large revenue and expenditure deficit. In addition to issuing the second rehabilitation public bond of 20 million yuan (issued on April 1 of the 25th year of the Republic), the implementation of business taxes (local taxes were still collected as usual), security expenses (one year's worth of land tax), local surcharges, and the successive collection of other harsh and miscellaneous taxes all became means of collecting money. These heavy burdens meant that the people of Sichuan, who had been suffering from excessive taxes and levies for more than 20 years, did not get a single chance to recover. Even the chairman of the province, Liu Xiang, could not help but express the sentiment that "over the past year, no work has been done to reduce the burden on the people of Sichuan."</p>
<p>The financial difficulties of the 24th year of the Republic were barely overcome. The fiscal budget for the 25th year of the Republic, after many discussions and revisions by important figures in the central government and the provincial government, was also announced in mid-August. The budget for this year obviously increased in numbers compared with the previous year, but its nature was no different. The content of the two-year budget is briefly shown in the following table (Note 3): (in units of thousands of national currency)</p>
<p>Revenue Section</p>
<p>Comparing the fiscal budgets for the two years, we can see several characteristics of the fiscal budget for the 25th year of the Republic: First, the method of adding three times the land tax as temporary military expenses has not changed. This makes us unable to help but wonder whether the so-called lie of relieving the people's difficulties is permanently just a dream that is difficult to realize? Second, the budget numbers have swelled. In terms of income, new items such as business tax, land tax, registration tax, and unified mining tax have been added. Is the income from these new taxes really guaranteed, or is it just to support the large expenditures on military affairs and debt? Third, in this year's fiscal budget, expenditures are still dominated by military affairs and debt, accounting for as much as 80% to 90% of the total expenditure. Because this phenomenon requires supporting large military expenditures, on the one hand, other government expenditures have to be reduced, hindering the development of culture and construction. On the other hand, the burden on the people has to be increased. In both of these aspects, there are shortcomings, so we have to borrow heavily and increase debt expenditures. On this cyclical path, the people are naturally "burned out," and the government is showing its "painstaking efforts." Regarding this year's budget, we have seen Ji Zuyou, who was in charge of the former financial department, make the following statement (Note 4):</p>
<p>"(...... Above omitted) Regarding the budget for the 25th year of the Republic, Director Liu is fully responsible for handling it. The actual amount of revenue and expenditure is about 85.6 million. After reporting it to the central government, the Ministry of Finance made slight changes to the revenue and expenditure. The most important thing is to hope to reduce military expenses. Considering the current situation in Sichuan, "military expenses account for about one-half of the total budget, which is naturally a bit large, but in fact, there is absolutely no other way to reduce it. Therefore, I met with President Chiang to explain the situation in Sichuan before finalizing the numbers. (......) Although the numbers have been finalized, some numbers require a lot of effort or other methods to make up for them. Now let's take the income from land tax as an example. The initially set number for this year was 26 million yuan. The amount collected in the 24th year was only 20 million yuan. Even if we work very hard this year, the maximum increase would only be 1-2 million yuan. It is very difficult to reach the number of 26 million yuan. Secondly, there is the fine for opium suppression. Last year's income was less than 6 million yuan, while this year's budget lists it as 9 million yuan. The number has increased by 3 million yuan. At this time when opium suppression is strict and the population of smokers is gradually decreasing, how can the income from fines increase? Thirdly, let's talk about business tax. The budget for business tax can collect more than 3.6 million yuan, but everyone generally believes that Chongqing, which has the highest income, has a maximum of only 40,000 yuan per month. In the whole of Sichuan, plus the counties with slightly higher income, it will definitely not reach the budget number. In this way, there are another 2 million yuan that are hoped for. In short, about 10 million yuan of the income budget listed for the 25th year can be considered to be reliable. President Chiang also said to Director Liu that these unreliable numbers are included in the budget, which is the most taboo thing for financial officers. In fact, how could Director Liu not know, but he was afraid that if the income numbers were reduced, the 40 million yuan in military expenses would definitely have problems, and the impact would be so significant. Therefore, he knowingly did it and had to take responsibility for finding other ways to make up for it. Speaking of the method of making up for it, what he has already thought of is to issue new deeds, which can increase a portion of the income in terms of budget income. Because Sichuan was in the era of defense zones in the past, people always thought of various ways to avoid paying taxes when buying and selling houses, and there were many illegal and unqualified deeds. Now that it is a unified period, we should reorganize and issue new deeds, and slightly charge for labor and handling fees. With the vast land of Sichuan, the income will be considerable" (Below omitted)</p>
<p>It turns out that the method of "finding other ways" is still nothing more than "issuing new deeds" to the people. The financial difficulties of Sichuan Province and the suffering of the people of Sichuan are evident from this.</p>
<p>㊁ The Deteriorating Industry</p>
<p>Regarding Sichuan's economic position, the author once said the following in the preface to a book (Note 5):</p>
<p>"From the analysis of Sichuan's import and export commodities, we can clearly understand the economic position in which Sichuan Province is located. Among the 22 important imported commodities that we have selected, almost all of them are machine-made goods or machine products. The 20+ important export commodities are mostly raw materials and unfinished products such as mountain goods and medicinal materials. Among the machine-made goods, what we must pay special attention to is the particularly large import volume of daily necessities such as fabrics and food, and the meager import volume of machine production equipment. This not only shows that the industrial foundation of our province is extremely weak, but also that we need to rely on foreign countries for basic necessities. This is something that we should deeply alert ourselves to."</p>
<p>Sichuan's industrial position is that of a supplier of raw production materials. Some people say that Sichuan is the "Land of Abundance" because it still has unexploited resources (although the actual situation may not be as perfect as ideal). Others praise its "abundant products". Sichuan is not unworthy of this title because, among all the necessities of life, Sichuan can be self-sufficient, except for the raw materials for "clothing," which are slightly lacking. However, have the abundant products been firmly protected? Can the existing industries really maintain or have the hope of rising? We are rather pessimistic after examining the situation in recent years.</p>
<p>When we mention Sichuan's products, the first thing that comes to our mind is silk. Sichuan is one of the three major sericultural areas in China. The annual output is about 15-16 million customs taels. When exports are booming, the value is 11-12 million customs taels per year. However, in recent years, due to the harassment of harsh taxes, the devastation of natural disasters and wars, the competition of foreign silk, and the impact of the global recession, it has plummeted. The bleak and declining situation is really unbearable to talk about. We only need to look at the following numbers to know.</p>
<p>Table of Sichuan's Export Volume and Value of Raw Silk in the Last Decade (Note 6) Quantity (Dan) Value (Customs Taels) Year</p>
<p>If we compare the above numbers with the number of silk mills that have closed down in Chongqing, Rongchang, and Wanxian in recent years, it is really shocking.</p>
<p>Cowhide and sheepskin are also major exports from Sichuan Province. Their products are known for their strong leather and dense fibers, and are deeply praised by Europeans and Americans. In recent years, in addition to suffering from the same natural and man-made disasters, exports have also been greatly reduced due to export merchants disregarding credit and cutting off their own path. However, the degree of decline is not as severe as that of raw silk and several other products.</p>
<p>Sichuan's medicinal materials are extremely famous in China. Because of their many varieties and good quality, they are sold at home and abroad, and have always occupied an important position in Sichuan's exports. In recent years, due to the competition of foreign medicines and Japanese imitations, and because the people are following old methods and not making improvements, the output is also much worse than before. There are also ramie cloth, tobacco leaves, gallnuts, and paper, etc., which are showing alarming declines for almost the same reasons! We can see this by reading the numbers in the table below.</p>
<p>Table of Sichuan's Export Value of Ramie Cloth, Tobacco Leaves, Gallnuts, and Paper in the Last Decade Unit: 10,000 Customs Taels (Note 7)</p>
<p>The above table only represents the general situation (readers who want to know more details should refer to the book "Statistics on Sichuan Province's Import and Export Trade in the Last 45 Years" compiled by the author). In summary, Sichuan's products in recent years have generally shown a large decline, and the reasons for the decline are nothing more than internal and external ones. Whether these reasons can be eliminated is a major issue for the future. Speaking of the development of Sichuan's industry, this is what we should pay close attention to.</p>
<p>In the situation where Sichuan's general products are showing a decline, only tung oil and bristles maintain a unique trend. This is caused by the special needs of the current international market. We should be happy about the current situation of these two products, but we must expect ourselves to work harder for the future of these two products.</p>
<p>㊂ Let's Talk About Transportation and Construction</p>
<p>The achievements of Sichuan Province in the two years since the implementation of the new administration may have seen some success in suppressing bandits and reforming officialdom. Reducing the burden is just empty talk. Then, the only major achievement may be the construction of transportation and economy. The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway has progressed from preparation to construction in a rapid progress. The completion of this railway is of great significance to Sichuan's politics, economy, and culture. We wish it a smooth success.</p>
<p>The progress of highway construction in Sichuan Province in recent years is also worth noting. 3,763 kilometers of highways have been completed in a short period of several years. 1,200 kilometers of new routes are also being rapidly opened up. The completion of these thousands of kilometers of highways has not only solved a part of Sichuan's transportation problems, but is also a history of blood and tears for the people of Sichuan.</p>
<p>Before the era of the defense zone system, the funds for road construction in Sichuan Province were mostly raised by the authorities' compulsory allocation or additional land taxes. The system was extremely chaotic, and the waste was very large, while the results obtained were very small. In the 23rd year, the government announced the order of compulsory labor, and most of the time, this method was adopted. With compulsory labor, the government does not give any compensation. The conscripted laborers not only have to provide their own food and bedding, but also have to bring road-building tools, such as hoes, shovels, carrying poles, and ropes. This method may have its advantages in theory, but if it cannot be properly applied, its drawbacks are really unimaginable. People who have been suffering for a long time and have no support are eating tree bark, mud, grass roots, bran, and chaff to serve the country. We read a record of a certain educator's on-site observation of compulsory labor for road construction in Sichuan Province, and we can imagine the situation of that group of white-haired children enduring hunger and rolling around in the dust. For the sake of humanity, we should not be indifferent!</p>
<p>The provincial government has been actively carrying out the work of developing Sichuan's products in the past two years. There is a planned and concrete adjustment plan. It has been promoted from the "experts'" desks to the vast countryside. In particular, the work of promoting agriculture seems to attract more attention. According to the report of the Construction Department, the achievements in agricultural promotion are roughly as follows.</p>
<p>Rice and wheat are the main crops in Sichuan, and the output is quite considerable. In recent years, due to the impact of natural and man-made disasters, Sichuan's products have been difficult to be self-sufficient. The Construction Department's plan to improve rice and wheat production first focuses on the investigation of the total output and consumption of the province, and then engages in the improvement of varieties and the prevention of disasters. Last year, the Construction Department and the Agricultural College of Sichuan University jointly formed the Sichuan Rice and Wheat Experimental Farm (now renamed the Improvement Institute), attempting to promote the excellent varieties obtained to various regions. It is not yet possible to determine what the results will be.</p>
<p>Sugarcane is also a specialty of Sichuan, but because the manufacturing is not precise and the quality is poor, it has not had any special development in foreign sales in the past. In view of this, the Construction Department transported more than 6,000 kilograms of Javanese sugarcane seeds back from Shanghai this summer, established a sugarcane experimental farm in Neijiang, and plans to establish a sugar factory with an annual output of more than 10,000 tons in Neijiang this year to adapt to the output after two years of promoting improved sugarcane varieties. It is planned to complete the production plan of 100,000 tons of refined sugar per year within five years.</p>
<p>We have already talked about the situation of Sichuan silk in the previous chapter. The government, in view of the disastrous failure of the silk industry in the past, established the Silk Bureau, attempting to complete the silk revival plan in a controlled manner. In the past, there was a silkworm breeding improvement farm in Nanchong, and it is said that the improved silkworm cocoons released have had good results. Now, the state-private joint venture raw silk trading company has also been established in Chongqing, so the problem of Sichuan silk transportation and sales can probably be solved in the future.</p>
<p>Tung oil in eastern Sichuan has been a darling of China's international trade commodities in recent years. The establishment of the Plant Oil Bureau recently will definitely be of great help in improving pressing, promoting transportation, and sales in the future.</p>
<p>In addition, the preparation of cotton experiment farms, the establishment of livestock conservation centers, the promotion of nurseries, and the investigation of forest land are all being actively promoted. We cannot help but say that the authorities are doing their best to value agricultural production.</p>
<p>In the current atmosphere of extremely strong production and construction in Sichuan Province, we feel that there are three extremely serious problems: The first is the problem of talent and technology, and the second is a prerequisite for developing industry. In recent years, the provincial government has reportedly recruited a considerable number of specialized talents, including, of course, many experts in various industries. The status of experts in the industry is often transcendent, and the rewards they enjoy are particularly generous. Experts who live up to their name can certainly develop the industry, but on the contrary, they can often become an obstacle to the industry. Following the old ways, delaying things, and wasting public funds are all common facts. We hope that there are no such facts among the experts who are helping with the construction of Sichuan Province, but we cannot guarantee that there are no such facts. In addition to the difficulty of finding experts, the training of cadres is also a considerable problem. The authorities do not seem to lack expressions of effort in this regard, but under many difficult prerequisites, we dare not lightly trust its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The second is the problem of funding. The annual expenditure on construction in the fiscal budget is very small. The only way to raise funds is to borrow money. Recently, the provincial government has submitted a request to the central government to issue construction bonds of 20 million yuan, which is a comforting thing in Sichuan, where public bonds have historically been exchanged for military supplies in internal wars. However, the issuance of public bonds has considerable burdens and considerable limitations. If proper allocation is not sought in the expenditure items, it is clear that this is not a permanent solution.</p>
<p>The third is the problem of the system. The industries that the authorities are currently promoting clearly have a tendency to focus on agriculture. Should the development of Sichuan's industry focus on industry, or should it focus on agriculture, or should both be given equal importance? If both are given equal importance, which should come first? This is a question worth studying and a question that needs to be decided urgently. More concrete plans should also be required for the mode (or system) of industrial operation. The policy currently adopted by the government is very similar to the form of a controlled economy. Then, the problems that should be considered for this system should be thoroughly resolved first, and there should be clear guidance in order to obtain focus and concentrate the goal of efforts!</p>
<p>Economic construction should be initiated by the entire public. It is not just the government's business, nor is it someone's business. The scope that individual hard work can contribute is very small, and the government's promotion inevitably falls into "official rhetoric." Speaking of Sichuan's economic construction, if we open our eyes and look at the lives of the masses of people in Sichuan, we should know where the key is.</p>
<p>㊃ Extremely Miserable Famine</p>
<p>In last year's nationwide celebration of a bumper harvest, disaster-stricken Sichuan suffered an unprecedented famine. This famine was truly unprecedented in its vast scope, and its type and degree were also very frightening and shocking!</p>
<p>In the drought in Sichuan Province in the 25th year, no county in the east, west, north, or south of Sichuan was not equally serious. The disaster reports that the provincial government received and the disaster news seen in the newspapers almost flew in like snowflakes, filling our ears and eyes. In June, rice prices in various places had soared from more than 2 yuan per dou to a high price of 4 yuan. Although there was government relief to stabilize the market, the effect was still very small.</p>
<p>A severe drought in the summer and a hopeless autumn harvest were already unbearable! It is well known that "Heaven does not tire of disasters," and then came the vicious "autumn drought," depriving the people of a lifeline. In September, the author was a guest in a rural village in eastern Sichuan, and saw the tragic situation of thousands of acres of red land. Listening to an old farmer talking to me about the crisis of the spring famine made people shudder for the land of 70 million people. The direct product of the famine is "green terror." Now, all the slightly remote places in Sichuan have created a great threat, and this power is not only developing in remote places.</p>
<p>The poisonous flames of the drought are still burning, and then there is a flood alarm, which is truly the so-called "misfortune never comes singly." The four river basins of the Jialing, Minjiang, Tuojiang, and Fujiang rivers in Sichuan were flooded, and the area affected by the disaster reached dozens of counties, and the loss of population and property cannot be counted.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of statistics, we cannot provide a more concrete number for this disaster for the time being. However, according to general observations, there has not been such a severe disaster in the history of the past ten years. Relief methods are currently being planned, but whether "a drop in the bucket" can have much effect, no one dares to say for sure.</p>
<p>Summarizing the above observations, we know that the burden on the people of Sichuan has not been reduced, and there is still no solution to the finances of Sichuan Province. Although there are considerable plans for economic construction, the people are poor and the treasury is empty, and even a clever woman cannot cook without rice. More serious is the current famine and the dangerous seeds it has sown. Although we may not be so pessimistic about the future of Sichuan Province, the current difficulties are also undeniable facts. How it will develop in the future depends entirely on the joint efforts of the government and the people.</p>

<h3>Market for Securities and Bonds Exhibits a State of Flux</h3>
<p>Last week, the public bond market was relatively calm. Due to the contention between bulls and bears, the market condition showed a state of flux. Retail investors' buying power was quite strong. However, rumors of powerful financial institutions engaging in significant selling persisted. Recently, bonds numbered 45, 46, and 35 have been continuously and aggressively sold off. Consequently, while the market price lacked the strength to rise, it also found it difficult to fall, gradually creating a brewing situation. However, observing the firm and buoyant market sentiment and the stability of the current situation, it is unlikely that there will be a sudden drop. Throughout the week, the market experienced the following: On Monday, major players holding bonds 45 and 46 continued to aggressively release large quantities, creating a very strong momentum. Bonds such as 戊 and 乙 uniformly fell by 4.5 to 1.1 yuan. Tuesday was the last day for February futures. The market process was quite stable, but due to major players continuing to release chips, the market price continued to weaken by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. The Fuxing Public Bonds rose sharply by 4 yuan to the limit due to the depletion of spot goods. On Monday, only March futures were traded, and retail investors' buying was extremely strong. The market condition tended to rise due to a state of flux. On Thursday, initially, the market was very bullish due to the introduction of April futures, and prices rose quite strongly. Subsequently, bonds numbered 35, 5, and 31, acting on behalf of a certain bank, conducted a large-scale sell-off, and the market price fell again by 0.2 to 0.65 yuan. Friday was the closing of the February futures delivery. On Saturday, major players continued to sell slowly, while retail investors' buying was also strong. Due to the standoff between bulls and bears, the market condition rose from a state of flux. The overall result for the week was that February and March futures fell by varying amounts, ranging from 0.15 to 1.1 yuan. April futures were newly introduced, and the total transaction volume was 42.09 million yuan. A comparison of the rises and falls is listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan), total:</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Robust Buying of Nearby and Distant Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday, upon the opening of the American cotton market, news from Liverpool was good. Traders and spot merchants bought nearby months. Foreign merchants and new off-market accounts favored distant-month New Orleans, buying May. All months rose by 3 to 5 points. Subsequently, due to hedging and large-scale long positions being closed out, there was a slight pullback. According to a report from the Goods and Loan Society, 415,291 bales of pledged cotton had been sold as of the 25th. Before the close, due to strong spot market activity and optimistic sentiment, short positions were continuously covered, and the market rose again, closing strong. The spot price rose by 7 points, and futures prices rose by 6 to 9 points. English cotton spot price fell by 1 point, and futures prices rose by 3 to 5 points. Indian cotton initially rose due to buying from European exporters and positive Liverpool telegrams, and short covering. Later, it retraced due to long liquidation. Broach rose by 1 to 1.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 1 to 1.15 rupees, and Bengal Desi rose by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram dated the 27th): American Cotton compared to the previous day, Legal Tender, English Cotton compared to the previous day, Legal Tender.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for the first of the month was: Bengal Desi at 226 rupees, Oomra at 207.5 rupees, and Broach at 180 rupees, all up 0.25 rupees. American Cotton Weekend Statistics (unit: thousands of bales)</p>
<h3>Food Grains and River Rice: Stagnant Sales in Retail and Wholesale Markets</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments from various gangs only reached about a dozen, totaling approximately 3,400 to 3,500 shi, with thin rice accounting for half of the volume. Although the supply was not large, both retail and wholesale markets were sluggish. Only the Xi'an gang bought over 300 packages of thin rice. Therefore, the market condition was mediocre. The prices of thick and thin粳 rice were generally soft. The passage of Duyang pointed rice was particularly sluggish, with prices falling by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, approximately 20 boats from various gangs along the river arrived at the閘. Sales of various goods in the market were lackluster. The price of white粳 rice slightly increased by a few cents, while the price of early thin rice decreased by another 0.7 to 0.8 cents. The price of Yangshe pointed rice fell by a small amount of 0.5 to 0.6 cents. The price of Yinbian Yuan rice also showed a downward trend. At the close of the market, transactions in various goods became more active, and prices stabilized.</p>
<h3>Review of the American Economic Boom and Raw Silk Consumption (II)</h3>
<p>— Wang Tianyu</p>
<p>3. General Fiber Consumption During Economic Prosperity</p>
<p>The economic boom in the United States undoubtedly led to an increase in people's purchasing power. According to the League of Nations Monthly Bulletin, the consumer price index for the United States, with 1919 as 100, reached its lowest point in 1932 at only 75.9. It then rose year by year, reaching 84.2 in 1933, 83.4 in 1934, and 87.6 in 1935. In 1936, it rose even further, reaching 91.6 in January and 95.2 in July. This kind of consumption boom naturally applied to textile fibers used for clothing. The fiber consumption index published in Analyst exceeded the average annual figure in January 1936. By mid-August, it had risen by a quarter, as shown in the table below:</p>
<p>U.S. Fiber Consumption Index (Average Year = 100) 1936</p>
<p>The above table clearly indicates that the consumption trends of raw silk differ from those of other fibers, especially when compared to rayon, which is quite similar in appearance to raw silk and is often used as a substitute. From this, we can see that the recovery of the consumer price index in the United States in recent years has not had any particularly positive impact on raw silk consumption. If we further examine the consumption quantity trends after the economic crisis of 1929, based on the survey by the National Federation of Textile Industries of America, we can gain a clearer understanding:</p>
<p>U.S. Raw Silk Consumption Statistics (Unit: bales) (Note): Ordinary year from January to November, business year from July to the following June.</p>
<p>Based on the above table, it can be seen that there is not much recovery in the consumption of raw silk. Looking at the ordinary year, last year barely exceeded the level of 1933; but compared to the previous five or six years, it was still about 100,000 dan behind. However, when observed from the business year, it has been decreasing almost year by year; this is also a point that cannot be ignored. Furthermore, according to the ordinary year, although the consumption quantity of raw silk showed an increase in the previous year, it actually showed the same downward trend when compared to the total consumption of fibers. According to the American "Textile Organ," the ratio of raw silk consumption quantity was 2.2% of the total fibers in 1930, 2.4% in 1932, reduced to 1.9% in 1934, and only accounted for 1.8% in 1935. The only fiber with a straight upward trend was rayon, which accounted for 7.2% of the total amount by 1935; an increase of 29% compared to 1934, while raw silk only increased by about 7%.</p>
<p>4. Analysis of Raw Silk Consumption</p>
<p>Although the American economy experienced a further rise last year, the consumption quantity of raw silk in the past ten months decreased by 53,000 bales compared to the same period last year, with an average monthly decrease of over 5,000 bales. Among them, except for August and September, which exceeded the previous year by several hundred bales, the largest decrease occurred in February, reaching nearly 10,000 bales. The smallest decrease was in June, also around 2,300 bales. It can be seen that the pessimistic views of many people are not without reason. Based on the figures published in the Monthly Bulletin of Silk Statistics, the comparison of the consumption quantity of American raw silk last year with the same period of the previous year is shown below to illustrate a point:</p>
<p>Comparison of U.S. Raw Silk Consumption Quantity (▲ indicates decrease) Increase/Decrease</p>
<p>Note: Unit: bales, one bale is equivalent to one dan.</p>
<p>Based on the above table, it can be seen that the decrease in American raw silk consumption quantity averaged about 12.5% in ten months, and the highest decrease rate was nearly a quarter. Furthermore, according to the total number of these ten months, it is estimated that the total consumption for the entire year last year will not exceed 450,000 dan, which is a sharp decrease of more than 25% from the peak period of 600,000 dan, and is an unprecedented phenomenon since the economic crisis. At this critical juncture of the American economic recovery, the decrease in raw silk consumption is surprisingly unexpected. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Tinplate: Actual Sales Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Since the囤 users have existing goods for sale, and shipments from Japan have also arrived, the market appearance of tinplate is extremely weak. Standard asking prices have generally loosened compared to before. Three-foot, six-foot sheets are selling for 1.22 to 1.23 yuan per sheet, a decrease of 0.02 to 0.03 yuan compared to before. Three-foot, seven-foot sheets are selling for 1.46 to 1.47 yuan, also a decrease of 0.01 to 0.02 yuan compared to before. Transactions by merchants are not strong because they purchased too much last year. However, sales to construction merchants and inter-trade deals are considered smooth, so the market situation is not excessively bleak.</p>
<h3>Factory Selling Round Nails at 13.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the factory price of round nails has been exceptionally firm due to the factory's lack of raw materials. Each barrel requires 13.5 yuan, a significant increase compared to before. Transactions such as those from the Yangtze River gang, inland river gang, and factories on this street are all referring to purchases, so the market situation feels particularly solid. Yesterday, over 500 to 600 barrels were still sold, reportedly sold by hardware stores in the North Suzhou Road area.</p>

<h3>After Reading the Declaration of the Third Plenary Session</h3>
<p>— Lü Bing</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session concluded on February 23rd. Upon reading the declaration, we feel that it thoroughly understands the current situation, determines the future trend, and considers everything comprehensively and meticulously. It is indeed the most appropriate guideline to adapt to China's environment.</p>
<p>In this declaration, both foreign and domestic affairs are elaborated upon. Externally, it seeks coexistence, and internally, it seeks self-reliance. The way to self-reliance lies first in national peace and unification: "...The purpose of peaceful unification is to concentrate the power of the entire country and the entire nation to overcome the current difficulties, and further to step into the path of democracy. Understanding the meaning of the entire country, it must be known that the power of governance is indivisible, especially in major aspects such as military, diplomacy, finance, and transportation, which are related to the needs of national defense, and must be fully controlled by the central government. Otherwise, partial independence will become an inferior organism and will ultimately be eliminated internationally..." These words are excellent. This is not only a resolution of the Congress but also the common desire of the national psyche.</p>
<p>We should know that since the founding of the Republic of China, the domestic turmoil and the deepening national crisis are rooted in the lack of national unification and peace. All military, diplomatic, financial, and transportation matters are fragmented and not subject to the central government's governance. Even in the telecommunications sector, concerning transportation, the impact of the lack of national peace and unification in the past has been significant. The entire telecommunications system originally falls under the central government's governance, but whenever there is unrest, the lines are destroyed, and most of the equipment is lost. As a result of partial independence, the central government cannot direct or audit the personnel administration related to telecommunications. In addition, arbitrary transmissions in violation of government orders and arrears in telegram fees all inflict significant blows on the telecommunications industry, making it impossible to carry out plans and extremely difficult to maintain. All of these hidden pains are deeply felt. Therefore, to seek the development of the telecommunications industry, national unification and peace are indispensable. Only with national unification and peace, under the central government's governance, can all personnel administration be subject to the central government's jurisdiction, and transmissions and payments be made in accordance with regulations. Then, the future will be clear, and there will be hope for the prosperity of telecommunications.</p>
<p>The Third Plenary Session has shown the people of the country what is mentioned above. Do all Chinese people want our country to become an inferior organic gift and be eliminated internationally? Please think about it again!</p>
<h3>Directorate General of Telecommunications Continues to Handle the Method of Returning Telegram Receipts</h3>
<p>— Jingwen</p>
<p>Since the trial implementation of the method of returning telegram receipts by local telegraph offices from December 1, 1936, it has indeed provided considerable convenience to the public. However, since the trial period has only been three months, many members of the general public who send and receive telegrams are still unaware of this method, resulting in it not being widely promoted. It is now heard that the Directorate General of Telecommunications has decided to continue the trial implementation of this new business method to benefit the people for another six months from March 1 of this year to observe its effectiveness. Therefore, the advantages of this method are briefly described again as follows:</p>
<p>㊀ Simple Procedure: After a sender goes to the telegraph office to send a telegram, if they want the recipient's telegraph office to obtain a receipt bearing the signature and seal of the recipient, as well as the time of receipt, after the telegram is properly delivered and return it to the sender, they only need to write the words "回據" (return receipt) in the "纳费标识" (payment identification) box on the telegram paper (which can be obtained from the telegraph office) (or at the beginning of the telegram if using self-prepared paper). For example, "-回據-Nanjing Zhujiang Road Shanghai Bank". If it is a foreign language telegram, the word Rpcp should be written as an identification mark. The identification mark, whether written in Chinese or a foreign language, is charged as one word to ensure fairness. In addition, the sender only needs to prepay a postage fee of 9 cents (i.e., the postage for registered printed matter), and the procedure can be completed, which is exceptionally simple.</p>
<p>㊁ Wide Range of Uses: The "Telegram Receipt Received" returned by the telegraph office has the signature and seal of the recipient and can be considered evidence of receipt of the telegram in both legal and accounting contexts. If the sender properly saves the receipt or attaches it to the accounting books as a document, it is a powerful supporting document. Furthermore, business firms or individuals who send important telegrams concerning remittances, accounts, legal matters, contracts, etc., invariably hope that the other party will reply immediately to confirm receipt. If the sender adopts the above-mentioned "receipt return" method, adds the "receipt return" identification mark at the beginning of the telegram, and prepays a postage fee of 9 cents, the receiving telegraph office will, after the telegram is signed for by the recipient, send a "Telegram Receipt Received" bearing the signature and seal of the recipient to the originating telegraph office for verification of the sender's address and dispatch it to the sender. Then, after the sender receives the receipt, they can prove that the telegram they sent has been properly delivered, without having to wait for the other party's reply. The function of one receipt is virtually the same as the recipient's reply telegram. Therefore, senders generally send telegrams concerning important matters such as contracts, legal matters, accounts, remittances, etc., should adopt the "receipt return" method to obtain a receipt bearing the signature and seal of the recipient for preservation. In case of future disputes, the "Telegram Receipt Received" can serve as powerful evidence, the wide range of uses is far beyond what is expected.</p>
<p>㊂ Cost Savings: Senders who send telegrams with the "receipt return" identification mark added only need to pay the telegram fee for one word of the payment identification mark and prepay a postage fee of 9 cents, which is a very small cost. Furthermore, if the sender has two or more telegrams to the same city and wants to use the "receipt return" method, in addition to writing the "receipt return" or Rpcp payment identification mark on each telegram and paying the fee for one word, they only need to prepay one postage fee. The same applies to distributed telegrams. However, if a distributed telegram is to use the "receipt return" method, the sender should separately write the above-mentioned payment identification mark before the address name of each recipient, for example, "-分送-唱据-Shanghai Yuyuan Road (608弄(75)号 Wen Zhongying-回据-Xiafei Road (285) Hao Xu Jianqing," otherwise, the telegraph office will only obtain a receipt from the recipient with the "receipt return" identification mark and send it back to the originating telegraph office for delivery to the sender. The above charging method can also save senders some postage fees. It can be seen that the new business methods recently implemented by the telegraph office are all based on the principle of enhancing communication convenience and reducing the burden on senders and receivers.</p>
<p>㊃ Safe and Reliable: When we mail important letters and want the post office to return a receipt signed and sealed by the recipient, we invariably adopt the registered mail method. The method of returning telegram receipts, which the telegraph office is continuing to trial implement this time, is the same in nature as the post office's registered mail method. It only requires paying a postage fee of 9 cents in addition to the telegram fee to obtain one or more "Telegram Receipts Received" signed and sealed by the recipient, which is exceptionally economical, safe, and reliable. Generally speaking, telegrams sent by senders concerning contracts, legal matters, accounts, remittances, and other matters are even more important than letters, and it is also advisable to imitate the method of sending registered mail, add the "receipt return" identification mark at the beginning of the telegram or in the "payment identification" box on the telegram paper, so that the telegraph office can return the "receipt" signed and sealed by the recipient for preservation. Therefore, the effect of this telegram with the "receipt return" identification mark is virtually the same as the post office's registered mail method. All senders who send important telegrams should adopt it as much as possible to show solemnity and ensure reliability.</p>
<h3>Summary of the Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Registration Method</h3>
<p>— Mu Gong</p>
<p>Effective from Today</p>
<p>According to the telegram registration regulations, the recipient of a telegram may select a word—whether Chinese or English—and apply to the telegraph office for registration. All recipient names and addresses may use the word as a substitute, which is very convenient. In order to enable recipients of domestic long-distance calls to avoid errors in names and addresses when receiving long-distance calls, which may hinder the call, the Ministry of Communications, with reference to the telegram registration regulations, has permitted recipients to apply for registration with their names and addresses, and on January 14, 1937, promulgated thirteen articles of the "Domestic Long-Distance Telephone Recipient Name and Address Registration Method," which came into effect on March 1 of this year. The public must pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Those who apply for registration should fill out an application form with the local telegraph office affiliated to the Ministry of Communications that handles long-distance telephone business in their locality. After the application is approved by the telegraph office, the telegraph office will designate a number to replace the recipient's name and address and issue a registration certificate. The recipient should then notify the relevant callers of the number. Callers may proceed as follows when making a call:</p>
<p>(Recipient) (City Name) (Registration Number) (Type of Call) (Caller's Phone Number and Name)</p>
<p>Example 1: Nanjing—Registration 315—Ordinary Call—22633 Li Wenxiu (used for calling the telegraph office)</p>
<p>(Type of Call) (Recipient) (City Name) (Registration Number) (Caller's Name and Address)</p>
<p>Example 2: Urgent Call—Tianjin—Registration 258—Liu Zi'an, 107 Xiafei Road, Shanghai (used for filling out the form at retail outlets)</p>
<p>According to Article 6 of the regulations: "The registration period shall be from the date of issuance of the registration certificate until the end of the year." Article 11 of the same regulations stipulates: "The telegraph office will not charge any fees for handling registration and issuing or exchanging certificates." This is superior to the telegram registration regulations. The effective period of both types of telegram registration 甲 and 乙 is calculated from the first day of the month of registration, and the effective period of telegram registration 丙 is calculated from the date of registration. The effective period of the long-distance telephone recipient name and address registration method, regardless of when the registration is made, is from the date of issuance of the registration certificate until the end of the year. In other words: this registration is calculated by year, not by month. Furthermore, the registration fee for telegram registration is 25 yuan, 10 yuan, and 1 yuan for types 甲, 乙, and 丙 respectively, while this registration does not distinguish between types and does not charge any fees. In other words: the telegraph office will serve unconditionally any long-distance telephone users who wish to use this method.</p>
<p>After the registration period expires, if the caller still uses the registration number to transmit a long-distance call, the receiving telegraph office may try to transmit it once and notify the recipient to continue registration. If they do not comply, the call will be discontinued thereafter. This still shows the intention of preferential treatment in the promotion of business.</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone Communications Between Shanghai and Important Locations</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Shanghai is the commercial center of the country, and the Ministry of Communications' national long-distance telephone construction plan stipulates that Shanghai is one of the central points. Since the completion of the nine-province long-distance telephone project, Shanghai has successively opened more than 200 telephone exchanges. In the future, after the completion of the amplification stations in various locations, all parts of the country will be able to communicate with Shanghai. Through the relay of international radio stations, it will further open communication with major commercial ports around the world. Meeting thousands of miles in one hall and resolving doubts in an instant, China's modernization spirit will be placed in the international telecommunications arena without being inferior. This is truly a great event. The prices for calls between Shanghai and important locations are listed below for reference:</p>
<p>The above only lists important cities because there are too many communication locations to list them all. Please inquire with the local telephone bureau or long-distance telephone retail outlets for satisfactory answers. The communication procedure is as follows: ㊀ If a telephone is installed, first call the long-distance platform of the telephone bureau, inform them of your telephone number, the recipient's location, and their name, address, or telephone number. After the long-distance platform completes the recording, hang up the receiver and wait for the call. ㊁ If you do not have a telephone installed and want to use a long-distance telephone, please register at the long-distance telephone retail outlets or public telephone offices affiliated with the telephone or telegraph bureau, prepay the communication fee once, and after obtaining the receipt, you can communicate in order of registration at that location.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Suzhou Carrier Wave Telephone Smooth</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Suzhou carrier wave telephone, since it was installed and tested last month, and officially opened on February 1, has been very convenient for the public because the tone wave has been raised and the sound wave is very clear. It has been discovered that this carrier wave mechanism is manufactured by the German Siemens factory and installed in the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, Zhabei Branch, and Suzhou Telegraph Bureau. It is of the MK type, specifically for short-distance long-distance open lines, such as 60 to 100 kilometers, and can transmit calls through a frequency of 80 to 140 kilocycles, which can increase the number of call return lines to as many as five on this pair of open lines. The mechanism is small, easy to install, and easy to adjust, so both economic and business aspects are beneficial. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications will also separately install corresponding carrier wave mechanisms on busy lines such as Beijing and Shanghai to make calls smooth and reduce waiting time.</p>
<p>The Jian'ou-Nanping telephone line in the Fujian region has been completed and opened for communication with six locations including Fuzhou on January 24. The call price is based on a three-minute system, with Jian'ou to Nanping at 3 corners, Shuikou at 5 corners, Fuzhou at 8 corners, Youxi at 5 corners, Gutian at 4 corners, and Minqing at 6 corners.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Scattered Strings of Spring</h3>
<p>— Chengxuan</p>
<p>Don't waste this beautiful time! Although it is said that "there are many good days in spring and autumn," "autumn" is ultimately not as good as "spring"! In the quiet fields: flowers silently unfold their smiles: trees can no longer bear to burst forth with their tender buds, a myriad of purples and reds, the indescribable beauty! Deep blues and tender greens, an endless pattern; enjoy the moment! Go appreciate the beauty of nature! There is all the true knowledge, the true learning that you want to know! The ancients said: "Holding a candle for a night tour," is really "a good reason"!!</p>
<p>The proverb says: "One moment of a spring night is worth a thousand gold" Ah! "The passing of the years is like this, not giving up the whole night," one moment of spring night is like this, one moment of spring day should be multiplied by it! People in the urban life of "spring sleep not realizing the dawn"! You should think about how precious the spring day is!</p>
<p>The plan for the year lies in "spring" and "spring is the beginning of the year." At this time of deepening national crisis, how should we work hard and measure? How should we be as vibrant as "spring"!</p>
<p>"Spring does not become spring when it comes to a poor family," in these years, reading the poem of Yao Chunmu, there is really a pain that cannot be said! Poets are mostly idealists and seek the future. Such a faint realism, it was like this in the past, and it is no different now!</p>
<h3>Scholar</h3>
<p>— Hua Binghe</p>
<p>Scholars are useless these days. It is certainly surprising that university students pull rickshaws, but it is not a good thing to be able to support themselves. It is terrible to still hold the idea that "a prime minister must be a scholar" in the late Qing Dynasty, and it actually produced many jokes.</p>
<p>When Zheng Xiaoxu was a border defense minister in western Guangdong, he was very proud of being a scholar in the military. However, at that time, bandits were rampant, and the people were almost unable to live. However, he thought he was successful and sang praises for thousands of years. He actually erected a monument and wrote poems, doing the work of self-praise. Therefore, he was impeached by Cen Chunxuan, the Governor-General of Liangguang, who scolded him as a painter of cakes and a famous scholar. It is pitiful that this border defense minister, who claimed to be a scholar in the military, originally wanted to be comparable to the story of Yanran Le Ming and Xianshan Fallen Tears, but ended up being ridiculed as a painter of cakes. Do you think it is pitiful or not?</p>
<p>The most interesting thing is that in the Middle East campaign, a Hunan governor named Wu was overjoyed to obtain an ancient seal of General Du Liao. He thought that this must be a sign of meritorious service in Liaodong and the ennoblement of Wanli, so he immediately wrote a memorial to the emperor, requesting to lead the army. Who knows that after arriving at the battlefield, he hung a death-免牌 in front of the camp, meaning that he wanted the enemy to disarm and surrender to avoid both sides being destroyed. On the one hand, he and several staff members wrote poetry and painted every day, but as a result, they were attacked by the enemy, causing the entire army to be annihilated and irretrievable. This scholar was really foolish.</p>
<p>Huang Zhongze has a poem saying: "A scholar is useless," This is such a painful thing.</p>
<h3>Snow in the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Snow Essay</p>
<p>Ever since I was little, having been born in the North, I have had an unspeakable love for "snow," and I don't know why.</p>
<p>In the Northeast, during the winter, you won't have a moment when you can't see "snow," not because it's snowing all the time, but because the weather is cold, and "snow" won't melt.</p>
<p>I like it best when it snows at night. Then, when you look outside in the morning, your eyes are filled with bright, silvery white. Everything appears simple, natural, and harmonious, instantly making you feel as if you're in another world, washing away all the dust and vulgar thoughts in your heart.</p>
<p>If there are trees nearby, you will see layers of snow piled up on the bare branches, pure white and exceptionally lovely.</p>
<p>At this time, whenever the snow stops falling, I put on my leather clothes and happily go for a walk in the snow. Sometimes, high blocks of ice freeze onto my heels. My feet make a "creak-creak" sound, and I love to watch my footprints one by one in the snow.</p>
<p>Sometimes, driving the "sledge" unique to the Northeast, supporting myself on the snow to play, it is fast and light, rolling over the tracks in the snow, truly a unique and elegant experience.</p>
<p>If you have had your fill of playing outside, it is best to do some "snow sweeping." Pushing a wooden rake, piling the snow into heaps, then you will feel a sense of pleasure, and I guarantee you will break a sweat!</p>
<p>If you are in the mood, great! Let's build a "snowman"! A big-bellied Buddha, a Luohan, whatever you like. Once it's built, it will stay there obediently, unless the snow melts.</p>
<p>After it snows, the streets are covered in ice, and it becomes a place for children to play "sliding." Every evening in the dim twilight, the lively laughter and shouts of children echo from the doorways of every house!</p>
<p>Since embarking on my journey, it has been a long time since I have seen the "snow" of my hometown. However, I still admire it as much as I used to. When will I be able to go back and see its beautiful appearance? …</p>
<h3>In the Lantern Market</h3>
<p>— Chen Damu</p>
<p>The New Year is lively. After the first five days have passed, and everyone has eaten "Wealth God Wine," this joyous abolished lunar new year seems to have come to an end. However, "lights up with glutinous rice balls, lights out with noodles", there is precedent for this. The Lantern Festival and the viewing of lanterns become an "extra" in a grand festival, which is indispensable. Otherwise, everyone feels deserted and unable to "disperse when the fun is over". The lighting of tall lanterns starts on the thirteenth day and ends on the eighteenth, and lasts six days including both ends. The drumming and firecrackers, the bright lanterns in every household, and the lively atmosphere surpass even the beginning of the New Year.</p>
<p>As a child, I was particularly excited about these days. When I saw the children in the neighborhood carrying watermelon lanterns and dragging rabbit lanterns, I felt envious and impatient, and quarreled with my parents incessantly. At first, my mother always refused my request: "Children don't know how hard it is to earn money. What's the use of buying those useless things!" At that time, I didn't understand these reasons, and I resented them in my heart, so angry that I refused to eat. Finally, my father agreed to take me to the lantern market in the City God Temple to pick one. What I loved the most was the crab lantern with eight legs and two pincers that could move, and the green-haired lion holding a ball lantern. But the price was very expensive, and I often couldn't make a deal even after visiting several stalls. In my heart, I only resented my father's stinginess. In the end, I only bought a cheap and unremarkable toad lantern and a lotus lantern, and I still didn't feel very happy.</p>
<p>But just like a dream, my childhood life has become a bubble. Although there are still occasional memories, there is no way to bring it back. And now I have become the father of two children. Only now do I understand the reason why my mother refused to buy me lanterns before, and I also understand my father's past distress in being stingy and unwilling to buy good lanterns. When I myself was forced by my children to go to the lantern market, and they吵着to buy good lanterns, I felt that the children were too noisy and did not consider the hardships of being an adult. Taking out a portion of the not-so-abundant living expenses to buy lanterns, a luxury item that cannot satisfy hunger or keep warm, is really a pity.</p>
<p>In the lantern market, with a troubled mood, my older son grabbed the corner of my right clothes, and my younger son grabbed the left side, squeezing from this stall to that stall. The lanterns were made more elaborate and exquisite year by year. The value is also directly proportional to the material. After more than two hours, I couldn't buy a satisfactory lantern, and I used all kinds of deceptive and insincere words to comfort the children: "Do you like this big revolving lantern? It's not as good as the Tangke car lantern, … But, be good, Dad thinks the airplane lantern is more fun. Do you know about saving the country through aviation and fighting the ×× devils." However, the children's patience was not as good as mine. They seemed to have seen through my deception, and it was not enough to maintain their confidence in me unless each of them was immediately bought a lantern. When I thought of my childhood memories and my aging parents, I couldn't help but lower my head to life. In this lively lantern market.</p>
<h3>The Phoenix Changes Its Nest</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven (Whispered Gratitude Felt for the Mother’s Pavilion; Repentant Sentiment Shown for Filial Piety; Autumn Light Dims Emerald Green; The Landscape Evokes Poetic Thoughts)</p>
<p>Menglan said, "I have two paths now. One is death, and the other is to obey my parents' orders. The third is… that doesn't need to be discussed. Second sister-in-law, you know I believe in religion. Religion considers a person who commits suicide a sinner against heaven and earth. No matter what, I won't commit suicide. As for my parents' orders, alas, I really can't say…" Saying that, she shook her head several times. The second young mistress said, "Since these two paths are impassable, then you should take the third path. What exactly is this third path? You might as well tell me. We're just chatting anyway, what's the rush?" Menglan said, "Alas! The third path, does that even need to be asked? It's like I've completely surrendered, and I'll do everything according to what the elders want." The second young mistress got up again, poured a cup of tea, and sipped it slowly. While sipping the tea, her eyes shot from the rim of the cup to Menglan's face several times. After finishing the cup of tea, she put down the cup and smiled at her, "Younger sister is a new person, but she talks a lot about old morality." Menglan said, "I'm a new person?" Saying that, she smiled slightly. The second young mistress smiled and said, "What? Don't you admit that you're a new person?" Menglan said, "If I were a new person, I wouldn't be in this topsy-turvy situation now. Where do I look like a new person?" The second young mistress nodded and said, "Although I don't know many characters, I often hear your second brother say to me. Young people are born in this era, whether they are new or old. Only those whose thoughts are neither new nor old are the most troubled. Why? Because they already know that their thoughts need to be new, but even if they walk on the new road, their family and society will inevitably be out of sync with them. People don't like to listen to what they say. People don't like to see what they do. Even the books they read, people say they shouldn't be read. If they abandon the new and walk only on the old road, young people will be called old and corrupt, and they won't be willing to accept it in their hearts. This makes it so that neither the new nor the old is good, and neither is solid. Younger sister, do you think what I said is right?" Menglan smiled and said, "What you said is absolutely right. I didn't expect that a young mistress in the family would understand so much of the suffering of young people." The second young mistress smiled and said, "This is called learning as you get older. Your second brother likes to discuss these things, and I often listen by the side, so I understand a little. In fact, what I understand is what I say. What I haven't said, I probably don't understand. You say my knowledge isn't very limited, right?" (138)</p>

<p>Good luck does not fly to you when you wait quietly.</p>

<h3>Old Opera Style in Patterns</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>In old operas, whether it is dialogue, lyrics, acting, stage steps, stage setting, or costumes and makeup, everything has certain rules, certain connections, and a necessary expression at the appropriate time. Anyone who is slightly familiar with the situation of old operas can imagine it and can try to compile and control it without any inappropriateness. I admit that all of these—everything in old operas—conforms to the pattern style. Stereotyped, accurate, and responsive are all the spirit of old operas. It takes the actors many years of hard work and practice to hope to become famous actors. The depth of an actor's attainment, in addition to seeing whether he can conform to the established examples or procedures of the performing arts, also has differences in the talent of each individual. That is exactly like the creators of pattern paintings also have coarse or fine structures, and the sensitivity or clumsiness of individuals, which can be used for people to identify and criticize. Foreigners appreciate Chinese old operas originally from the starting point of aestheticism.</p>
<h3>Ink Monkey</h3>
<p>— Chen Tianci</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Jilin in the three northeastern provinces has the three treasures of sable fur, ginseng, and Ula grass. However, there is another kind of living treasure in the pine forests of the three northeastern provinces, but it is not familiar to people, that is the ink monkey.</p>
<p>The ink monkey is only a little over three inches long, its fur is purple, its eyes are golden, and its tail is short. Each one is worth about five hundred gold. Those who get it mostly keep it in an ivory brush holder, locked with a very thin gold chain, and eat pine table pomegranate seeds. The ink monkey is named for ink because it is fond of fragrant ink, and it licks and eats it whenever there is excess ink left over from grinding ink for painting.</p>
<p>In the deep mountains of Taiwan, there is also a kind of small monkey, a little over four inches long, with red eyes and pure black fur. It also likes to eat ink, and it also likes to eat sugarcane, corn, and famous kinds of nuts. It is heard that this kind of monkey is produced in the mountain valleys near the sea in Right Bay. If a ship passes underneath, they gather to watch. However, they are extremely alert and clever, and they are agile and good at avoiding, so it is very difficult to get them, and they are rarely seen on the market.</p>
<h3>Poison Gas Was Invented in China</h3>
<p>— He Laohe</p>
<p>Recently, I read Chief Censor Qi's Jixiao Xinshu and saw a section on the method of making a "sky-filling smoke spray tube." Examining its effect, it is no different from what is now called poison gas. I have specially transcribed the original text below to show that we also had it three hundred years ago: "Cut coarse bamboo one inch in diameter, and fasten it with cloth hoops. Use saltpeter, sulfur, arsenic, cantharides, river sand, alum, soap pods, copper green, Sichuan pepper, pinellia, swallow droppings, soot, lime, doulan grass, grass bird, polygonum hydropiper, and garlic. Divide the methods into degrees and measure the magnetic sand, Wangtian sand, and sand poison. Tie it to the end of a gun pole, ignite it in the direction of the wind, and it will cause tears, sneezing, difficulty breathing, and mouth shut…" (See Qi Jiguang's Jixiao Xinshu, Chapter Eighteen of the Governance of Water Soldiers.)</p>
<h3>Reminiscing About the People of the Past</h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>Archaeologists say: "The pyramids of Egypt are rare architectural structures; the astronomy of Babylon is a pity because it is not passed down now."</p>
<p>Politicians say: "Democratic republican politics were first realized in ancient Greece. That was true democratic republic."</p>
<p>Literary scholars say: "The Book of Songs is a wonderful book of folk literature; the writing style of the Spring and Autumn Annals is truly difficult to change even one word. To learn calligraphy, you still have to learn from the Han and Wei Dynasties."</p>
<p>Ordinary people say: "In the past, rice was only seven or eight yuan a stone, and eggs were four or five cash each. Those past days were really good."</p>
<h3>The Pottery Industry of Yixing</h3>
<p>— Wu Baipeng</p>
<p>The pottery industry of Yixing, which has always enjoyed a great reputation, is regarded as a rare treasure by all those within and outside the country who love archaeology and are erudite. In recent years, the rise of pottery shops and the unimpeded sales of products are enough to prove that my writing is not fabricated.</p>
<p>The pottery clay originally comes from Shushan Town in my Yixing. According to legend, it was created by the Great Doctor Fan Li of Yue, who came to live in Lishu. Located in the southeast corner of the city, the purple clay produced has different luster, some red like fire, some gray and blue-yellow, which is not found in other towns, and only my Yixing produces it.</p>
<p>The products are mostly for daily use and display, such as teapots, teacups, flowerpots, water inkstones, reds, urns, bottles, jars, etc., with many patterns and a dazzling array of goods. In recent years, with the progress of industry, no matter people, birds, or animals, the soil color is distributed, closely resembling the shape of objects, lifelike and realistic, truly masterpieces.</p>
<p>The manufacturing method is roughly divided into five major categories: making blanks, repairing blanks, carving, applying oil, and applying color. However, they all rely on manual labor. Today, they still adhere to the old methods and have not yet seen perfection. In addition, the complexity of the manufacturing method and the slow delivery of goods are a major impact on production.</p>
<p>Recently, the government, in view of the desire to improve this industry, has specially set up a provincial pottery school near Shushan, specializing in cultivating talents and assisting in teaching. Although only a few years have passed in haste, the results have been remarkable, and we have to regard it as a good phenomenon for the revival of the pottery industry.</p>
<p>The oldest and most refined in pottery making is Wu Dingsheng. The shop is located on Zhongzheng Street in the city. The owner, Wu Hanwen, is nearly sixty years old, but he is full of energy. He usually eats vegetarian food and chants Buddhist scriptures. He is the king of the pottery industry in my Yixing. Others such as Yixing Wu Hanji Xingye are slightly inferior.</p>
<p>In short, in everything you do, you must have a little competitive spirit. This competition is not in lowering prices, but in the quality of materials. Try to observe the current situation. How many people can pay attention to materials? Most of them are eager to sell at low prices, and they don't care about the quality of materials or the processing of manufacturing. This is really heartbreaking.</p>

<p>Talking Point</p>
<h3>The Rise and Fall of Broadcasting</h3>
<p>— Jia Qian</p>
<p>The prevalence of broadcasting in China is still a matter of the last three to five years. I remember that the first few broadcasting stations were all "amateur" in nature. That is, there was no limit to the frequency, and there were no various programs. They only broadcast records, and it seems that business advertisements were a later thing. However, even under these circumstances, listeners welcomed a new gadget. At that time, crystal sets and single-tube radios could be sold at very good prices. Due to the surge in radios, broadcasting stations increased programs and business advertisements. At the same time, the International Telecommunications Bureau also limited the frequency of broadcasting stations. That was the golden age of broadcasting. There were more than forty broadcasting stations in Shanghai alone. Every day from seven or eight o'clock in the morning until four o'clock in the morning, the radio was never silent, and the import of radios also gave us an astonishing number.</p>
<p>However, since last year, this emerging industry has been affected by the downturn in various industries and has gradually declined. Also, because the members of the broadcasting staff are complex, and the Telecommunications Bureau has also limited ten kinds of programs that are not allowed to be broadcast between 6 pm and 10 pm, this has given a heavy blow to the broadcasting industry and broadcasting staff.</p>
<p>Recently, the Telecommunications Bureau has ordered eight broadcasting stations, including Tongle and Zhou Xieji, to stop broadcasting. "The stations have all stated that they were established in accordance with the regulations on private radio stations of the Ministry of Communications and submitted applications for permission. They are legal private enterprises and should be protected by the government according to law if they have not violated the regulations. On February 4, they stated their reasons and submitted another request to the ministry to withdraw its order and issue standards for the equipment of private radio stations. However, they have not been approved, so yesterday (the 27th) all private radio stations stopped broadcasting for one day and sent representatives to Beijing to petition."</p>
<p>The outcome of the petition, in the coming days I think there will be a follow up, now it is not necessary to speculate. However, according to what the author knows, the Ministry of Communications recently issued a notice to all broadcasting stations regarding the allocation of programs, 60% for education and 40% for entertainment. It is naturally a gratifying phenomenon to use pure entertainment broadcasting to assist education. The report of the Trade Bureau puts the number of radio imports in the same column as cosmetics and other consumables. Even if the pure entertainment broadcasting industry returns to its former heyday, I am afraid it will feel ashamed.</p>
<p>In Europe, America, and Japan, the most prominent is the Soviet Union, broadcasting stations are not only a powerful tool for promoting education and academics, but also an important tool in the military. And we spend countless amounts of money on "private engagement in the back garden" and "capturing Zhang Sanlang alive" voices, naturally there is a need for rectification, and starting to increase educational programs first is also very correct. However, we also have to look at the target of purchasing radios from another perspective. Will they abandon the erhu and pipa and take classes by the radio like elementary school students? Even if the broadcasting stations broadcast 100% educational programs, I am afraid that these more than 100,000 radios will be put on a high shelf, and they will flock to the Oriental Bookstore.</p>
<p>Listeners purchase radios mainly for entertainment programs. We should start from "integrating education with entertainment." Whether it is comedy, storytelling, or any entertainment program, we should rope them with goals. Now, all kinds of entertainment program scripts have to be reviewed by the Social Affairs Bureau before they are allowed to be broadcast. Starting from here, perhaps we can "achieve twice the result with half the effort." This is a bit of a humble opinion that the author offers. In China, it is too early to use broadcasting to "popularize education" no matter what.</p>
<h3>On the Open Field</h3>
<p>— Lyon</p>
<p>People who seek life in the city want to breathe a little fresh air, just like looking for a pool of water in the desert. When I first discovered this new home, I felt so relieved. Although this dilapidated floor looked somewhat like an ancient temple that had been in disrepair for years, with rotten rafters and mottled powder brick walls, it often gave people unpleasantness. What I loved, however, were the four bright tile windows facing south and the open field outside the window. A jujube tree stood next to the building, tall and beautiful. Its sturdy branches stretched straight up to the window. In the summer, when the leaves were lush, it made a natural curtain for the small building. In the morning, the little sparrows drummed their reed-like tongues on the branches and sang beautiful songs. So I jumped out of bed to enjoy the regulation of plant oxygen. When the autumn wind rose, I could pick jujubes to eat by slightly reaching out at the window of the building. Although this open field and jujube tree were not my ancestral property, I have unconditionally become their temporary owner.</p>
<p>How fortunate a enjoyer I was, a traveler in the desert found a sweet spring.</p>
<p>However, there were days of suffering. Winter and spring were the coming of these days. Except for rainy and snowy days, the winter sun was particularly good on this open field. Precisely because the sun was good, it attracted some old women, mothers, and children from the nearby low houses. They came to enjoy the warmth given by nature. Even the workers in the rope-making field moved the heavy wooden frames to the open field to twist ropes. The unrestrained wildness and fighting of the children, the intentional or unintentional teasing of the workers and mothers, the old women's mumbling rebukes, a kind of noisy and chaos, disturbed my thoughts. Closing the window was useless. Trying to put pen to paper, I would often be hit by a burst of laughter or a noisy scolding. Sometimes I was really annoyed by the noise. I left my chair and desk, preparing to push open the window to issue a warning or reprimand to the crowd on the open field, but I immediately dismissed this idea. What qualifications did I have to interfere with their freedom to enjoy life? And how could I prohibit the expression of the public's nature for my own sake of seeking tranquility?</p>
<p>So I sat down patiently again, throwing away my anger, and admonishing myself: I should temper myself to become a public and sacrifice personal enjoyment.</p>
<p>A winter was tempered in this way. The open field in the new spring was even more lively. Every day there was a burst that made my heart shake. In the sounds of these crude instruments, it seemed to be filled with the call of life: "Hey, do you want money or life? Hey, do you want money or life!" Several times, I really felt frightened and covered my ears. In this day and age, are there really people who risk their lives to earn a living? As soon as this doubt surfaced in my mind, reason immediately gave an answer from the side: How could there not be, and there are many more. If you are willing to carefully investigate the society, isn't it staging the heartbreaking tragedy of life of "wanting money and not life" everywhere! I immediately understood: From the open field outside the window, you can see the prototype of the entire society.</p>
<p>Today, people who do monkey shows came to the open field again. In addition to the main character, the monkey, there was also a sheep and a mutt. I was also a member of the audience. At first, the monkey, sheep, and mutt were all tied to the jujube tree trunk. This jujube tree that regulated my living environment unexpectedly became their shackles at this moment. The monkey show people opened the wooden box and took out many clothes and face masks. With a whip in one hand, the monkey, under the direction of the whip, put on clothes and face masks, rode on the sheep's back, and pretended to be human to do tricks. Finally, it was the mutt's turn, kneeling to the audience to beg. Then the person shouted: "Give money, give money!" How could animals do tricks willingly? They were nothing more than being forced by the whip.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>There was no way. The most pitiful was still the tame sheep, which became the slave of a slave.</p>
<p>From then on, I had a deeper understanding of the open field outside the bright tile window.</p>
<h3>A Realistic Tragedy</h3>
<p>— Nan'ou</p>
<p>Just as dawn was breaking, workers in the mining area began to get up from their residences. They coughed, casually spat, and indistinct voices carried outside. The weather had been rather strange lately, mostly rain. The soil was all wet and loose. Old worker Shen Gui looked at the continuous rain and muttered:</p>
<p>"The natural order has changed! I've been here for fifteen years and never encountered weather like this!"</p>
<p>"It doesn't rain much in Nanyang – this is truly strange!" Another person, hearing Shen Gui's words, casually responded.</p>
<p>Today, Shen Gui got up, and the first thing he did was stick his head out of the small window to look at the sky, trying to determine if the sun would come out. It was hard to say for sure, but he was certain it would be clear. The roof of the house across the way was still damp, and water droplets were still dripping from the eaves. At this moment, the young Gu A'er got up and ran out. Shen Gui, seeing his bare back, said to him with envy:</p>
<p>"A'er, you really are an ox! Going out shirtless so early in the morning, aren't you afraid of getting sick?"</p>
<p>"Good morning, Uncle Shen Gui!" A'er replied with a smile: "We laborers aren't afraid of the cold." Then, he turned back into the house. A'er's wife was taking out clothes she had washed very clean for him. She and A'er had only been married for five years, and their son was almost two years old. This young couple was often envied in the mining area. Now, A'er was going to work as usual. He put on his hat, picked up a lamp for use in the mine, glanced at his still sleeping child, and went out.</p>
<p>On the way to the mine, Gu A'er walked together with Shen Gui and the others through the gray morning mist. The experienced Shen Gui mentioned to people that the mine wasn't as solid as usual due to the excessive rain and that if they weren't careful, they might… He didn't finish the sentence. A'er patted him on the shoulder, saying that Shen Gui was worrying too much: why think of misfortune all the time?</p>
<p>And so, A'er happily worked in the mine. The foreman patrolled around, scolding people, which made the air in the mine unusually oppressive. There were also carts carrying stones rumbling past, heading outside. From the entrance of the mine to where A'er worked was almost half a mile long. Here, there wasn't a ray of sunlight. People breathed in the smell of dirt, and their bodies were covered in filth. The iron picks struck the stone, making a dinging sound. Without the lamps, this would be a truly dark world.</p>
<p>Work proceeded as usual… Someone was singing a Hakka mountain song, and there was laughter… Everyone seemed to be without a care…</p>
<p>But suddenly, with a bang—a sound like a thunderclap—the noise shook the workers' hearts in the mine. In an instant, the light from above was completely blocked, and piles of dirt fell down one after another. People immediately cried out. Shen Gui's shout was especially shrill:</p>
<p>"Oh no! The mine is collapsing!"</p>
<p>"Help! He-elp!" Some people, crushed by crossbeams, were shouting for help, but the falling rocks, wooden beams, and dirt were burying everyone.</p>
<p>Children and women from the residential area ran over, completely frantic. The mine police were busy maintaining order. The mine owner, chewing on a cheroot, looked like his eyes were about to burst into flames, sending out telegrams for help. And the secretary beside him was cursing in his heart: "A life-despising bastard! Didn't the engineer say five days ago to find a way to protect the workers' lives, that the mine wasn't very stable? Now… It's too late! Too late!"</p>
<p>The sun, as if surprised by such a tragedy in the human world, stuck its head out. And those who weren't afraid of the scorching equatorial sun waited together: in the mine, their fathers, husbands, or friends were trapped. What could they do to save those being buried alive underground?</p>
<p>By noon the next day, the rescue operation was considered to be over. When Shen Gui was pulled out of the ground, he had already been dead for more than half an hour. And Gu A'er, this strong, young fellow, had at least survived with his life, sent to the hospital for treatment. It was said that this time, more than sixty people had lost their lives: the number of injured was countless.</p>
<p>Such tragedies have happened more than once in the tin mines of the Malay Peninsula! However, this was a particularly terrible one! That year, I lived in ×× port, not far from the mining area. Hearing about the lack of protection for the lives of workers, I was deeply angered, and still am to this day…</p>
<h3>Stealing a Horse</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>—One of the Northeast Stories—</p>
<p>All of you are in the South and rarely have the opportunity to ride horses. In fact, riding a horse is the most interesting thing. This year, I saw a donkey track on Yuyuan Road in Shanghai. The people riding the donkeys were wearing Western suits, and the donkeys were not much bigger than pigs. It didn't look right at all. Once you get to the North, you'll know how magnificent and interesting it is to ride a horse.</p>
<p>There was a time when I was a messenger in the brigade. Sometimes, when there was urgent official business, I had to run to a place 250 li away in a day and return the same night. In that case, only a good horse could handle it.</p>
<p>I don't know how much effort I put into finding a good horse. The brigade leader once lent me his favorite chestnut horse, but that animal lacked stamina. At first, it ran like crazy, but then it slowed down to a stroll. Even if I whipped it, it wouldn't move.</p>
<p>Later, I learned that the village chief in the neighboring village had a good horse. I had seen this horse before. It was tall, with a long nose and a tight belly. It was really a good one. From then on, I tried everything I could to get my hands on it.</p>
<p>One day, it was snowing lightly. The brothers treated me to a couple of cups of baijiu. As we talked, we started talking about horses again. I suddenly remembered the village chief's horse. I didn't want to, but it was strange, that night, I couldn't wait to steal it. I thought and thought, and decided to steal it tonight when there was no moon.</p>
<p>I borrowed a pistol and two pairs of rubber overshoes from the captain. These were all spoils of war from the Yilan area last year. I drank two more cups of wine to embolden myself, and then I got up, no matter what.</p>
<p>Once I got outside the town, the wind was whipping the snow, and the pine forest was howling wildly. I was hot and anxious. I whipped my horse a few times and ran straight to the neighboring village.</p>
<p>I tied the horse to a tree near the village. I quietly crossed the brick wall of the village chief's house. The wall was only about two feet high, enough to stop livestock, but not people. I quietly opened the wicker gate. The sky was pitch black. The fence was hissing in the wind. Even if I made a sound opening the gate, no one would hear it. I used my hands to lift the wooden door of the stable, and it immediately came off its hinges. The horse had already fallen asleep. I sprayed baijiu into its nose and mouth again and again, and quietly put the rubber overshoes on the horse's feet. Look, I was doing it so carefully, as if I had been stealing horses for five generations.</p>
<p>I led it out. After passing through the shed door, there was still no sound. As soon as I got outside the town, I took off the rubber overshoes. Some wild dogs barked like crazy, but no one heard it.</p>
<p>I was really happy as could be. I returned to the pine forest, untied the original horse, and then ran towards the town. I used the horse for two full years. I don't know who rides it now.</p>

<h3>Readers' Letters Regarding the "Abyssinia" Incident (Twenty-one Letters)</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>We read with great enthusiasm the declaration of 122 people from the Shanghai literary, artistic, film, drama, and music circles against the sailors' atrocities.</p>
<p>This time, Italian sailors used violence to smash the Shanghai Grand Theater, injure dozens of our compatriots, and burn the "Abyssinia" film, which was passionately loved by our oppressed nation—this incident of insulting our nation and country can be said to have set a new record for the powerful interfering with the weak. They not only despised our government's sovereignty in supervising films but also destroyed our local legal and police authority. They simply treat the Chinese people as tame slaves!</p>
<p>Therefore, we believe that the Shanghai literary and artistic circles, etc., put forward in the declaration: urging the government to demand compensation for losses from Italy, punish the murderers, apologize, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future, etc., and believe that it is sufficient to represent the public opinion of all of us. Whether we stand in the position of moviegoers or patriotic compatriots, we are willing to unite as a strong backing for the government's tough diplomatic negotiations.</p>
<p>However, we sincerely hope that people across the country will unite and not turn a blind eye, especially the press, which is responsible for promoting public opinion, should do its best for the future of this negotiation!</p>
<p>Sincerely hope that you can publish the letter.</p>
<p>Readers: Ye Hengrong, Jin Xichu, Xu Bingnan, Huang Xiaobai, Xu Jie, Guo Mingjin, Xu Mengqiu, Wang Zhijia, Zhang Dingsui, Mo Zhuan, Zhang Jing, Zhou Chenghun, Zhang Renwei, Xu Peizhong, Wan Ming, Chen Xingzhou, Bao Zhigang, Fan Pingye, Cai Taosheng, Qi Tianran</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The last signatory of the twenty-one readers' letters was not included because the signature was unclear. We hope to be notified and will add it later.</p>
<h3>Hua'an Broadcasting</h3>
<p>The entire film "Daughter of the General" has been filmed and is now being edited intensively.</p>
<p>"Pearls Left in the Sea of People" is Zhu Shilin's new film, which has been largely completed, with only a few scattered shots remaining. The ballroom scene is set in Lido, accommodating 400 pairs of dancers.</p>
<p>In "Pearls Left in the Sea of People," Li Lili performs the rattle drum dance. Lili is very proficient in various dance techniques. This rattle drum dance is newly learned, taught by a famous Western dancer in Shanghai, and the dance posture is graceful and light.</p>
<p>In "Pearls Left in the Sea of People," Yin Xiucen and Han Langen are a pair of "double acts." The two of them get together to eat tofu in the ballroom, inventing a new tofu dance with novel postures.</p>
<p>"Kirin Music House" is an artistic epic directed by Zhou Yihua. Zhou is proficient in old operas and loves film art. He laments that the excellent melodies of our national operas have become Guanglingsan (lost classics); this time, he vows to preserve the essence of old operas and cooperate with Zhou Xinfang to pass on a generation of artists.</p>
<p>"Kirin Music House" is based on Zhou Xinfang's signature masterpieces and selects those that contain inspiring patriotic ideas for filming, which can both preserve the authenticity of the opera and achieve the effect of guidance.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's new work "Wang Laowu" has been approved by Nanjing and has begun filming.</p>
<p>"Wang Laowu" is about a mediocre and ignorant person who suffers all kinds of life pressures, unable to laugh or cry, a pitiful insect who sacrifices himself meaninglessly in a turbulent period.</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan has recently received an increasing number of letters from fans, which she cannot answer in time. A "Chen Fan" lady who came from Changsha at a great distance, upon meeting Chen, burst into tears with joy and described her four hundred unanswered letters to Chen and the suffering of her day and night unrequited love, which can be said to be the greatest miracle under heaven.</p>
<p>Li Lili loves music the most and plays the piano well. She still runs to the home of an old Western woman every day, diligently seeking to improve herself.</p>
<p>Yin Xiucen dreamed of the Spring Festival and continued to sleep for three days and nights, not participating in dancing or gambling, and gained another ten pounds.</p>
<p>"Kirin Music House" needs to borrow the entire set of large incense tables from Hong Jingling's house. Hong burned incense and prayed repeatedly before daring to move them, fearing offending his family's "Second Lord."</p>

<h3>Minxin News</h3>
<p>"The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" has been shown in Peiping and Tientsin, and business is excellent. The Zhengguang and Liangyuan theaters of the Suzhou YMCA showed it simultaneously. According to a special letter from the theater authorities, it has been sold out for days. Guangzhou will be showing it soon, and the Shanghai run is not far away, and it will undoubtedly be welcomed by the audience. The film has a very realistic story, a tortuous and moving performance, and a novel style, all of which are rare in domestic films.</p>
<p>In the past, Li Keng's talent was discovered while filming "Humanity," and he jumped to become a shining child star in the Chinese film scene. Now, Minxin is filming "New Humanity" and has discovered Li Keng's younger brother, Li Xi, who is also a rare talented child star. Although only five years old, he not only understands acting very well and is as good as one could hope, but he also does not throw tantrums and does not interfere with work, which makes Minxin colleagues especially surprised. After the premiere of "New Humanity," the society's surprise and joy at the emergence of this little star is the same as when Li Keng was discovered.</p>
<p>In "New Humanity," Liang Saizhu not only broke her previous achievements in acting, but also made every effort to make her makeup and clothing gorgeous, and will definitely give the audience a new impression in the future.</p>
<p>Ren Pengnian's "Mysterious Female Detective" is progressing very smoothly, because the preparation period was very long, so since the start of work, most of the time is spent filming. According to accurate estimates, about half has been completed.</p>
<p>Currently, Zhong Shigen is working hard on adding subtitles to a portion of the film "The Gate of Flesh and Spirit" for comparison. These copies will be specially prepared for screening in special areas where Mandarin is not very common.</p>
<h3>The Atrocities of Local Tyrants and Evil Gentry</h3>
<p>Remember when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, there were slogans everywhere calling for the overthrow of local tyrants and evil gentry. Indeed, local tyrants and evil gentry are too hateful! Tianyi's film "Yangliu Village" fully exposes the atrocities of local tyrants and evil gentry.</p>
<p>"Yangliu Village" is directed by Gao Lihen and has been filmed and is awaiting release.</p>
<h3>Yu Guang Embezzles Public Funds</h3>
<p>When the dancer Zhu Qiuhen and the bank clerk Yu Guang were holding their wedding, several detectives came to the hall and arrested Yu Guang for embezzling public funds. This bolt from the blue knocked Zhu Qiuhen to the ground. Fortunately, the two dancers Lu Ming and Yan Yuexian, who lived with her day and night, slowly woke her up. Zhu Qiuhen's tears flowed like a tide. She was heartbroken, constantly shouting madly, "Marriage, marriage, this is marriage!"</p>
<p>This is a sad event in "Elastic Daughter."</p>
