<h3>大塲以北澈宵血戰我正大舉反攻嚴密截擊</h3>
<p>黃港湖裡宅一帶我猛攻佔優勢　俞家宅季項宅乙綫敵進犯擊退　我空軍砟夜轟炸蕰藻浜南敵陣</p>
<p>蕰藻浜南岸黑大黃宅至墻門頭宅之敵、十二日總攻失敗後、增援補充於十四日再度南犯、惟隨處遭遇我軍强力之抵禦、血戰三畫夜、以三千傷亡之代價、南進二公里、而至葛家牌樓、經我反攻予敵重創、雙方旅進旅退、傷亡奇重、十八日下午一時、敵藉飛機大砲坦克車之掩護、又猛犯我黃港陣地、我軍奮不顧身、咸浴血衝鋒、以鎗刀向敵軍猛刺達兩小時、雙方均有重大損傷、惟我援軍因敵軍砲火猛烈、不能及時趕到、故陣地略有突破、入夜後、我生力軍加入作戰、數度反攻、激戰至昨日（十九日）深夜未已、同時我軍照原定計劃、加强兩翼實力、待機夾攻、敵知不能績進乃傾全力以犯劉行大塲公路之綫、昨竟日夜、沿公路兩旁有數處激戰、砲火連天、傷亡遍野、戰况之慘烈、得未曾有、我軍陣地、雖有數點被敵突破、惟援軍源源開到、正在猛烈反攻中、本報今晨二時所獲前方報吿、我軍極佔優勢、頑敵深入、已被我嚴密包圍堵擊、日內當可解决也</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者十九日午前十時半報吿、盤踞葛家牌樓之敵、於十八日下午一時起、以七八百人之雄厚兵力、向距葛家牌樓百餘公尺之黃港猛攻、其時敵機敵砲、不斷向我陣前轟炸、我軍冒砲火出擊、與敵肉搏、相持兩小時、敵我傷亡、均甚慘重、我援軍受敵機之阻、前進困難、故陣地一度被敵突破、入晚後、我生力軍加入作戰、士氣大振、經數度逆襲、頗為得手、並於本日淸晨二時、已逼近葑村塘、惟敵遭此挫折、惶恐異常、乃大舉再來、於黎明後、又在陸空聯合之火力下、向我進犯、卒以來勢過猛、我黃港據點、卒吿不守、</p>
<p>犯湖裡宅被我嚴阻</p>
<p>同時另有敵千餘、與進犯黃港之部隊、聯合向西淮犯、攻我湖裏宅蘇家宅之綫、我軍早有戒備、見敵來犯、卽奮勇迎擊、我某旅長負創指揮、土氣甚盛、雖在敵機之壓迫、頗有傷亡、惟前仆後繼、絕不却退、血戰至夜、得後頭部隊之協助、猛烈反攻、阻敵前進、迄本社隨軍記者於晚上時第二次報吿時、尚在激戰中、又壩石橋宅之敵、亦積極西犯、故張家樓上及丁家宅之處、均激戰終日、惟我軍咸抱與陣地共亡之决心、决不任其輕易得一莊一宅、</p>
<p>黃家宅我兩連犧牲</p>
<p>敵南犯目的、在進取大塲、以襲我廟行江灣之側营、其進犯之路綫、初由公路、惟已失敗、繼向路西突進、因港汶縱橫、重兵器失却效力、受創甚重、故今日又向公路來犯、先於拂曉時、用坦克車約三十輛在唐橋結集成縱隊、掩護大軍南進、約七時、進約八百公尺、被我擊回、敵卽分兵一部及車八輛、攻我路西黃家宅與路東膏荏橋宅兩處、黃家宅我軍僅兩連、敵避重就輕、全力移向該點猛攻、我軍猶奮勇支持兩小時、至午前十一時、全部作壯烈之犧牲、</p>
<p>敵續南進激戰擊退</p>
<p>該股敵軍、於突破我黃家宅之綫後、再度南進約八百公尺、攻我路東之蘇家橋宅、一度亦吿吃緊、惟經增援血戰、敵卒不逞向後退去、而距唐橋約一千九百公尺之馬橋宅、亦有敵車十餘輛來犯、經我以平射砲轟擊、敵車受創、亦卽退去、尚有一股於晚七時許、東犯俞家宅、季項宅之綫、找軍出擊、遂開始激戰、迄晚十時報吿時、我軍仍扼守原陣、</p>
<p>公路之東兩處激戰</p>
<p>公路東首沿蕰藻浜之處、敵據江家新宅及嚴家灣兩處、昨亦蠢動不已、江家新宅之敵、於午刻向西北犯找周程宅附近之處、惟其乓力單薄　故經我逆擊、卽行竄逃、我截獲機槍兩挺、步槍三十餘支至嚴家灣之敵則東犯我顧家宅．楊宅．紫陽浜之綫、惟亦僅百餘、不堪我軍一擊、卽抱頭鼠竄而去、總觀全日激戰之情形、敵南犯大塲之企圖、固甚明顯、惟我隨處有堅固之據點、尤死守公路之綫、故在此縱橫僅四千公尺之區、敵集一師團以上之兵力、血戰已一星期仍無發展、刻我已將陣地配備就緒、卽按照預定計劃、大舉反攻云、</p>
<h3>敵仍圖中央突破向我廣福陣地進犯</h3>
<p>我已準備重兵决迎頭痛擊</p>
<p>敵軍在蕰藻浜南岸一帶猛烈進犯、血戰多日、互有進退、每一村莊之得失、恒在數次以上、故雙方犧牲均鉅、據熟悉軍事者談、敵此種舉動、實係聲東擊西之計策、蓋廣福方面之敵、於昨晚得援後、已在開始向我廣福方面陣地全力進犯、企圖機績實現其中央突破之計劃、故先佯攻蕰藻浜南岸、以轉移我軍目標、我軍早已洞燭其計、在廣福方面、已釀置重兵、實力增厚、敵如來犯、决于迎節痛擊、</p>
<p>中央社廣福隨軍記者十九日晨九時半報吿、老陸宅·新木橋·南梅宅·萬年橋一帶、敵以排砲向我廣福南北全綫陣地轟擊、砲火密集、綿亘二千餘公尺、自昨晚開始、至今晨始停、敵軍此舉、乃阻我反攻、而使進犯陳家巷之主力、解除後顧之虞、我軍洞悉其奸、故嚴陣以待、相機進攻以收夾擊之效云、又據被我軍俘獲之敵中尉尾三郎供稱、廣福以北．南梅宅．北梅宅　唐宅．等一帶連日來猛犯我廣福之敵、為第十一師團之第四三．四四．兩聯隊、廣福附近新木橋一帶之敵為第九師團之第三三聯隊、</p>

<p>昨晚碧空舞雲、明月皎潔、我忠勇空軍、又出動助戰、十時半、滬市上空、隱約可聞軋軋機聲、浦江敵艦、亟以探照燈搜尋、惟我空軍飛往蕰藻浜南岸轟炸敵軍陣地、故未臨滬空、敵艦亦未發砲、</p>

<h3>孔副院長談出使之感想</h3>
<p>威謝友邦盛意　嘉許僑胞愛國　—百餘工會電孔氏致敬—</p>
<p>孔副院長已於前日下午五時、由港乘輪抵滬、記者昨日再度晋謁、請示以此次在英參加大典在歐美各國考察經濟建設及返國經過各地之感想、承發表談話如下、</p>
<p>此次奉命代表赴英、參加英皇加冕典禮、順道遊歷各國、繼續五年前之經濟建設考察任務、得與各友邦朝野人士、聚首言歡、欣幸無似、尤其所至之地、友邦朝野、吾國僑胞、無不熱烈歡迎、竭誠款待更為可感、深知如此隆邁加諸本人、並非厚愛於個人、實因我為最古之文化國、而最近又邁進於建設之途徑、故對我國家、表示敬意、本人適躬逢其會耳、故本人於此、除表示個人感激外、更應代表國家、向各友邦致敬、</p>
<p>當在英參加英皇加冕典禮時、於莊嚴隆重之儀式中、深感英國上有組織嚴密之政府、下有團結鞏固之民衆、故能使種族不同之人民、區域散漫之國土、溶於一𪺋、契合無間、宜乎大國之風度、爲世人所欣羨、至在法·比·德·意·美·等國、自致府黨局以至社會領袖、凡所接觸者、莫不對我固有之文化及新興事業、表示好感、對於我國年來經濟建設之進展、尤爲信任、故在經濟上有願我合作者、有願予我以援助者、凡此均早見諸報端、毋庸贅述、此種盛意之贊助、果能從容實施、國家前逮之進展、實未可限量、不幸為敵所忌、侵略益亟、不可幸免之戰事、終於發生使我建設計劃、感受影響，實屬痛心、吾人於此、除竭力設法賡績進行外、對於在經濟上與我合作及援助之各友邦、應表示深切之謝意、</p>
<p>中日戰事發生後、本擬兼程返國、因國際間應行接洽之事尚多、未能卽行、同時亦以國內軍政大計、在中央及蔣委員長領導之下、均經佈置周妥、而本人所掌之財政金融、因年來中央之積極準備、人民之熱心維護、亦早趨於穩定、且現在交通便利、在外亦隨時可以指揮、仍可從容應付、因之遷延迄今、始獲歸來、至各國人士對中日戰事之觀察孰是孰非、本有定評、不過初尚諍觀、不願輕易有所表示、但兩月以來、一方面因我國將士、忠勇抗戰、壯烈犧牲、使得敵無所施其計、認我確具自力更生之能力、一方面因敵人轟炸我不設防之城市、殘殺我非作戰之人民、遠犯世界人道主義、遂有同情與援助之具體表示及行動、可見尊德性愛和平、實人類之天性、滅棄德性破壞和平者、即人類之公敵、諺云、公道自在人心、於此可見、我國古聖賢有以德服人之格言、總理有和平奮國之遺敎、故道德和平、實我東方固有文化之基本信條、日本民族、陶沐於東方文化者千百年、彼邦民衆尊德性、愛和平者、定佔絕對多數、惜一時為少數强橫之軍閥所刦持而無可如何、果使愛好和平主持正義之各國、對此滅棄德性、破壞和平之日本軍閥、加以有效之制裁、深信日本明瞭之人士、亦必擊起而為人類之道德和平而努力、</p>
<p>此次歸來、船過新加坡·馬尼刺·及香港各地所見各界僑胞、無不盡力輸捐、以裕國用、尤以中下層之工商界、更為熱烈、雖肩挑負販、亦均以三日之全部收入、捐納政府、愛國熱忱、殊堪嘉許海外僑胞如此、想我生於斯、長於斯、食住於斯之國內人土、更當知所努力矣、</p>
<p>昨由吳淞抵埠、目覩浦江兩岸、所受敵人之破壞情形、可以測知我前方愛國將士之浴血苦戰不惜犧牲、我後方各地人民遭受之損害痛苦、實不勝悲感與憫懷、惟是多購可以美邦、禦侮始能圖存、吾民族國家能否屹立於今日之世界、即於此次戰爭决之、值此生死存亡關頭、深望全國上下、同心恊力、抱定犧牲到底之决心、以博最後之勝利、此不獨為我國圖生存而已、且兼爲人類保存德性爲世界保障和平、意義員至重大也、</p>
<p>本市綢緞業　棉布業·木材業·紙業·國貨橡膠業·典當業·內河輪船業　米號業·糖業·麵粉廠業·雜糧油餅業·五金業．針織業·參燕業·新桑業·製藥廠業·彩印業·呢絨業·百貨業·水菓業·飛花業·化學原料業·等一百七十三同業公會、昨聞行政院副院長兼財政部長孔祥熙氏公畢返國、特電致敬、文曰、行政院孔副院長鈞鑒、龐旌榮還、舉國歡騰、維坫　之週旋、仰賢勞之显著、際此抗戰展開國家度支、端賴運籌、實業金融、尤待扶掖、任重致遠、彌深霓望　謹電致敬、伏維垂察、上海市绸緞業等一百七十三同業公會同叩皓印、</p>
<h3>義兵槍擊工人案我提二次抗議</h3>
<p>首次抗議義方覆牒推諉　俞市長再函義總領辯覆</p>
<p>關於上月義大利駐軍在蘇州河岸槍擊渡河工人蔡子紅等一案、俞市長曾向義總領事奈若尼提出嚴重抗議　已誌前報、詎義方覆牒措詞推諉、聞俞市長已提第二次抗議、茲探綠原文如下、遷啟者、責問領事本月六日大函、業已奉悉、惟本市長對於來函所主張各節、仍難認為允當、茲再申述其理由如下、查此次渡河之舢板、時在淸晨、其中所載、胥爲常用渡河之工人、爲守望駐軍所極易辯認、且第一次渡河之舢板、已准靠岸　何忽對第二次渡河之工人、加以拒絕、致令渡河者無所適從、關於此節、本市長前函已經述及、况當貴國軍士阻止其前進時、以不諳貴國詁言之中國工人、欲其了解　或遵守貴國巡查隊以義語所發布之命令、殊為事實所難能、乃該兵士竟不用其他方法阻止　遞爾開槍射擊、自屬過當行為　應負故意傷害之責任、至貴國兵士在所謂防區內行使職權　有無條約根據、茲姑不具論、而在該處所施行之種種限制辦法、亦未聞明白昭示、彼以勞動爲職業之小工、卽使稍有誤會　亦情理之常、故來函所稱儿該區居民、對通過地點、均已明瞭一點　更屬片面之辭、來函轉述貴國兵士所以必需開槍云云、其理由殊欠充分　故本市長認此案肇事之責任、應由貴國兵士完全担負、該無辜之兩華人　實不能尸其咎、准函前由、相應函復、並希杳照本市長上月三十日去函、分別辦理見復為荷　此致義國駐劄上海總領事奈若尼、</p>
<h3>德僑住宅被敵機炸毀德總領提抗議</h3>
<p>德僑財產均挿有本國國旗　敵軍藐視事實竟予以轟炸</p>
<p>本月十四日（上星期四）曾有敵織多架、飛往虹橋路一帶濫施轟炸、該處之德僑住宅四所、竟亦遭敵機投憚、其中有數所被炸一部、亦有全被炸毀者、駐滬德國總領事爲此炸特向駐滬日本總領事提出抗議、指出該處德僑房屋、皆于屋頂懸有德國國旗、甚爲明顯、日人竟藐視此種事實、予以轟炸、因此德僑在滬生命財産、亦同受威脅云、此外向俞市長亦提抗議、略謂虹橋路附近之鐵道上所停之客車、距德僑房屋甚近、因此遂危及德僑之財產此項車輛停放該處、無任何特殊軍車事理由、故特請予注意、並將此類車輛移至不妨害德僑財産及生命之地點云、據德國負責方面消息、日方發言人所謂德國此項抗議、僅係提交中國一方、全屬不確、德國總領事、除向中國當局提出抗議外、同時亦有抗議牒文致送日方當局云、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>各國勞工界的排日運動</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>在布魯塞爾會議的前夜。各國勞工團體。無論原來色彩如何。一致熱烈地進行着排日運動。這是非常值得重視的。</p>
<p>據英國總工會執委會最近所發表的聲明。美國·加拿大·紐西蘭·澳洲聯邦·墨西哥·印度·比利時·荷蘭·法國·瑞士·瑞典·挪威·丹麥·捷克·奧地利·愛爾蘭各國工會。對於英國全國勞工運動執委會前所通過的關於譴責日本暴行及主張抵制日貨的决議案。一致表示贊同。並都决定實行抵制日貨。還有很可注意的。是美國兩大勞工團體卽勞工聯合會及工業組織委員會。向來互相水火。鬥爭頗烈。最近除各通過斥資侵略國的决議案以外。還有為世界和平共同行動的趨向。</p>
<p>國際强盜的侵略行為。危害着世界和平。各國人民若不用有效方法加以戢止。而任其蔓延。則世界上任何一隅都難避免戰禍。這原是各國任何階層的人們所同感的但勞工階層對侵略國家。因為直接的利害關係較少。無所用其顧忌。也就首先採取打擊國際强盜的步驟了。</p>
<p>各國勞工界排日運動的高漲顯然有着莫大的效果。我們的敵人因此將在經濟上受到嚴重的打擊。是不消說的。就是各國政府的外交方計也不能不從國內努工界的情緒上受着相當的影響。至少其間對國際强盜縱容迁就這一種因素。現在是可望减削幾分了。</p>

<h3>在轟炸中來去</h3>
<p>— 郭沫若</p>
<p>十一</p>
<p>晚飯應了×××的邀约，有淳如同座。</p>
<p>××和我雖然才見兩次面，但已如多年的老友一樣，什麼話都坦白地說了出來，絲臺客氣的必要也沒有感覺着了。他的體魄是很魁梧的，我在初只以為他是一位純粹的模範軍人，但他對於文學的趣味卻異常深厚。在這第二次的會面上，他談到了郁達夫，談到了茅盾，更談到了惲代英。他說代英不僅長於演說，而且會做文章，可惜他死早了，不然在現在又是該他活躍的時候。</p>
<p>講到了敵人的轟炸南京上來。敵人早就宣言過，二十一號的正午以後要大規模地轟炸南京，請各國的外交人員及居留民一律退出。這種拙劣的暴戾的宣言，表示透了日本人的欺軟怕硬的事大主義。中國人是好惹的，打死幾十百萬都不要緊，外國人卻不好惹呵。日本人在外國人面前是侏儒，在中國人面前是哼哈，這就是他們的“武士道。”狗屁</p>
<p>——但是敵人的飛機多多飛來襲擊後方，倒是我們所歡迎的，因為那樣可以减少我們前敵將士的痛苦，增加我們全面抗戰的敵愾。這是××所表示的意見，這話使我受着了深切的銘感。</p>
<p>平型關的勝利也由××口中報吿了出來。這消息在中午時早就聽見人說，但大家都還在半信半疑，這次是證實了。但作戰的情形和參加作戰的部隊，還沒有得到明確的報吿。</p>
<p>飯後我向淳如說；我打算在一二天之內回到上海，因為還有些要緊的工作非去料理不可。</p>
<p>淳如說：汽車是方便的，隨時可以動身。又說他也想到前方去視家，已有電向前方請示，大约明天便可以有回電。</p>
<p>於是我們便约定明天下午三四時左右離開南京，假如一切的情形是許可的時候。</p>
<p>旣决定要趕回上海，有先行報吿蔣先生的必要。從××的分館退出之後，我便再去訪問張岳軍，託他為我轉達。同時也把蔣先生和我談話的情形對他說了，重申了我自己的不敢接受名義的私意。</p>
<p>岳軍都回答了，要一一為我轉達。他問我：是不是還想見見汪先生？</p>
<p>我說：極其願意，只要汪先生有方便的時間。</p>
<p>岳軍當時便去打電話給汪先生，约定了明天上午九點鑛在某處會面。同時他還把我向他吿訴了的平型關勝利的消息詢問了一個仔細。</p>
<p>勝利的確是大規模的斃敵三千，俘虜二千，虜獲敵人軍實輜重無算。參加的部隊是第八路軍，作戰的情形是先以一營人擾敵後方，誘至有埋伏的山谷，一擧而殲滅亡。</p>
<p>眞是愉快，假使是在十年前，聽到這樣的消息，一定又牛飲了一大瓶白蘭地。</p>
<h3>美僑受滬戰影響損失四百萬元</h3>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>宣布日本違约侵犯中國以後</h3>
<p>— 張志讓</p>
<p>我國於九月十二日向國聯提出申訴書，於同月十五日又由首席代表顧維鈞向國聯大會聲明；希望宣布日本為侵略國。雖然國聯還至今並沒有這樣宣布，然而它於本月六日的大會中通過召開九國公约會議的决議案時，同時通過了一個認定事實的報吿書，在這裹面，却已明白指出：日本以陸海空軍對中國為軍事的行動，非藉必要自衛，不能自解，然而主張自衛，並無根據可査，所以這些行動實在是違背了它在九國公约和非戰公约內所負的義務。英國國務部也於同日發表了一個聲明，謂日本在中國的行動不合國際關係的原則，並且違背九國公约和非戰公约的規定，美國政府所得的結論與國聯大會相同。</p>
<p>這樣一種的認定與認定日本為侵略國，還有什末差別？侵略國或侵略戰爭不過是個槪念，它無論應該採取那一種的定義，違法地對他國為軍事行動，總不會不包括在它這個槪念的範圍之內。就像認定一個人確會違法地將他人置之於死，與直接呌他是個殺人犯，除了說法不同之外，沒有什末分別。所以國聯和美國認定了上述的事實，就無異是宣布了日本為侵略國——到了日本是否為侵略國的這個問題必須答復的時候，它們除非推翻前言，决不能有第二個答復。</p>
<p>國聯和美國這樣的一個認定是以發生極大的影響，——它確定了國聯各會員國和美國對於中日戰爭在法律上，政治上和道德上的地位，指出了九國公约會議應該採取的途徑，並且提示了我國當前應該實施的事項。</p>
<p>國聯盟约第十條規定：國聯會員國擔任尊重並日對於外界的侵略保全各會員國領土的完整和現有的政治獨立：第上一條規定：任何戰爭均認為是與整個聯盟有關的事件，國聯應該實施適寓有效的行動來保障國際的和平，第十六條規定：會員國如有不顧盟约關於公斷，裁判等項辦法的規定而從事戰爭時，此項戰爭應認為是對於國聯其他各會員國全體的戰爭行為，它們於此擔任對於破壞盟约的國家斷絕一切商業和金融的關係，並在金融及經濟方策上及在抵制盟國特別對於某一國或數國所施行的方策上彼此互助；第十七條規定上述各項規定適用到非會員國時所應有的手續。這是國聯會員國於有戰爭發生時所負擔的義務——它們對於侵略國應該實施經濟制裁和軍事的制裁，並且於一定條件之下彼此互助·美國固然不是國聯會員國：不受盟约的拘束，然而它却是巴黎非戰公约的簽字國。這個公约正式宣示排斥採取戰爭的解决國際爭議的方法，擯棄它為對外關係的國策之工具，並且規定：無論何種糾紛均應以和平方法解决。在這個公约之下，日本對於其他簽字各國，包括美國，負有不從事戰爭的義務。</p>
<p>現在日本對中國從事戰爭，無論它有無理由，總是對於非戰公约的簽字國違背了不從事戰爭的義務，對於國聯會員國發生了實施制裁的原因·這是單就日本對華戰爭的本身論的。若再論到它歷來的軍事行動所造成的局面，那末它又對於九國公约各簽字國主要地違背了尊重中國領土與行政之完整的義務。在如此情形之下，國聯各會員國和簽字非戰公约與九國公约各國——尤其是其中參加白魯塞爾會議的各國——就在法律上和道德上擔負了一定的責任。</p>
<p>從消極方面來講，它們對於中國的抗戰，以後無論如何，依法不能再有宣布中立的可能——美國的中立法加沒有實施的理由。這是因為國聯會員國已經有了對日實施制裁的義務，非戰公约簽字國已經發見日本在那裹從事那個公约所排斥擯棄的行為。嚴守中立是對於犯人與被害人一視同仁的辦法，所以它不但是為道德之所不容，而且也為上述盟约與公约之所不許。不但如此，國聯大會本月六日所通過的决議案中已　明稱，大會對於中國表示精神上的協助，並向各會員國建議戒絕一切是以削弱中國抵抗力量的行為並考量各國單獨可以援助中國的程度。美國總統羅斯福於本月五日演說亦稱，應將染有不守法紀的疫病的國家，予以强制隔離美國，國務部又於次日援引羅斯福總統的演詞，主張國際條约必须尊重。所以它們已經沒有保守中立的可能，實在是很明顯。了</p>
<p>從積極方面來講，我們可以——並且立即應該——向參加九國公约會議的各國主張對日實施經濟軍事等項的制裁。美國雖然不受國聯聯盟约拘束，然而也有效的方法來强制取消公约所排斥擯棄的行為之責任，而武力制裁實為此種方法中之最有效的。</p>
<p>我們就是退一步，不提出武力制裁為第一步的方策，也祇少應該主張各國立即對日斷絕經濟關係和外交關係。就是美國參議院外交委員會主席畢德門於本月六日發表宣言闡明羅斯福總統的强制隔離方法，也主張世界各國應該擯絕日本，拒絕與之交往，這也就是上面所述的意思。</p>
<p>我國應該向關係各國提出上述的主張，恐怕是沒有人能否認的。那末在提出這個主張以前，我國自己應該怎樣做呢？我們要向人家請走一步，當然我們自己應該至少先走三步。我們决不能不先把自己對日的經濟關係斷絕而反向人家主張實行經濟制裁；同樣地也决不能不先把自己對日的外交關係斷絕血反向人家主張對日絕交。所以在自魯塞爾會議開會以前我國應該趕快對日實施以下的各項行為：㊀召回駐日大使館全體人員及各領事：㊁宣布失效及效力停止的條约並停付外債本息：㊂沒收敵國在華公有的財產並參的世界大戰以前的習價與大戰期間的實例規定處置敵國人民在華私有財產的辦法；㊃參酌大戰以前及當時的先例規定處置在華敵國人民的辦法；㊄禁止與敵通商，斷絕一切經濟關係。這樣才能從害觀上表示我國在主觀上早已其有的破釜沉舟之决心。最後我國還應該及早聲明：我國臺加這個因為日本破壞九國公约而召開的會議，是懷着一種信念而來的——這個信念，就是：各國决不會違反九國公约關於尊重我國領土完整的規定和正義與公道的原則，而來提出調解的辦法的。</p>

<h3>敵圖進犯大塲不逞我精銳部隊正三面夾擊</h3>
<p>敵四次猛攻蘇家宅均經擊退　黃港湖裡宅一帶敵被我圍困　我仍堅守俞家宅陳家宅陣地</p>
<p>本報今午接得前方戰報如下、大塲北面戰事、自昨晚至今晨十時前、其重心仍在滬太公路兪家宅左右兩綫、尤以公路以西葛家牌樓宅至蘇家宅一帶爲最激烈、敵軍目的、以戰車沿公路直撲大塲正面、另以主力衝擊小池園蘇家宅、企圖突破大塲南翔間之公路、壓迫我軍後路、故敵軍於突進葛家牌樓宅後、復於昨日傍晚起、調集大批强頑步兵、在其大砲密射之下、由黃港方面、向我蘇家宅·小池園·陣地、猛力衝擊、以尖角形之陣勢、激烈進撲、我軍以此路有關大塲之得失、乃調遣精銳部隊、分左右兩冀向敵包抄、會同蘇家宅正面圍攻、當卽展開空前血戰、至今晨八時止、敵軍四次衝鋒、我軍三面廝殺、前仆後繼、有進無退、故敵軍屢次猛衝、均遭痛擊、死傷過半而退、我方亦有相當損失、敵終以傷亡慘重、於今晨八時後、退集黃港湖裏宅一帶、被我三面包圍中、敵因該綫我方勢必反攻、且駐有重兵、故在葛家牌樓宅附近趕築工事、又沿公路正面黃家宅方面之敵、昨以坦克車三十輛、分向東南面蘇家林宅·兪家宅我軍陣地、掩護大隊敵兵、猛力進撲、並有敵機多架、投彈轟炸、當時我後方援軍以敵軍火力過密、未能赶上、致有一部陣地、被其突破、黃昏後我軍始分途反攻、血戰通宵、敵之坦克車、被我迫擊砲摧燬三輛、乃於今晨拂曉前　不支潰退回黃家宅以北、自天明至十時、敵未敢來犯、我軍仍在沿滬太公路之兪家宅陳家宅以北陣綫堅守、陳家巷仍在我軍之手、前被突破之陣地、亦已修復、日將該處北面自頓悟寺至蔡家塘之間、一部陣地、亦經奪回、昨晚今晨、敵雖不斷以小部兵力前來擾亂、籍以牽制、但該處我方駐有精銳部隊、敵之企圖、决難得逞、廣福鎮正面之敵、昨今均未進犯、惟劉行方面敵軍砲隊、時向我方轟擊、我軍屹不為動、羅店西面我軍仍堅守原陣地、並無變化、廟行東北面、昨晚有小衝突、敵軍砲兵、每隔兩三小時、射擊一次、但其小部步兵來犯時、一經我軍出擊、立卽退去、江灣至閘北之綫、雙方均取守勢、昨今均無激烈戰、</p>
<p>薀藻浜南岸滬太公路西、黃港蘇家宅間一綫、我敵雙方現已展開主力大戰、此戰形勢、有完全打破敵方進攻大場企圖之可能、我在大塲附近兵力雄厚、陣地堅固、大塲絕對無慮、同時一般人杞憂大場方面形勢緊張、深恐連带及右翼閘北至江灣綫、亦將撤退者、茲據我軍事當局堅决聲稱、絕對無關、設或大場不守、閘北亦必如現狀、堅守抵抗、决不放棄、事實上敵犯大場、僅為夢想而已、</p>
<h3>葛家牌樓之敵被我包圍夾擊</h3>
<p>我由馬橋襲敵左側　敵軍後路發生動搖</p>
<p>敵軍自在葛家牌樓宅之役、遭我軍重創後、乃亟亟增援、希圖困鬥、但該綫我大軍雲集、有恃無恐、連日來血戰展開、雙方砲火之密、與乎搏擊之烈、實為空前未有、敵方損失奇重、屍橫枕籍、血濺四野、我軍雖有相當犧牲、但陣地鞏固、始終未被敵方所逞、因此敵軍一籌莫展、又慮孤軍深入之忌、乃移兵東側、向我季項宅方面偸襲、以挽孤立之勢、不意又遭我軍痛擊、刻下敵軍籍其後方援軍之助、又冀捲十重來、分向季項宅葛家牌樓宅一帶進窺、向時敵空軍亦出動助戰、我軍洞燭其計、除正面迎頭痛勦外、已出動馬橋宅兪家宅方面重兵、向敵軍左側進攻、包抄進窺葛家牌樓宅敵軍後路甚爲得手、故葛家牌樓宅方面敵軍後路、已發生動搖、同時我湖裏宅及張家樓下綫重兵、亦呼應夾擊、故目下敵軍主力、已被我包圍、</p>
<p>中央社江灣隨軍記者二十日午十二時四十分報吿、薀藻浜南岸之戰事、自轉移至公路綫上後、敵將其坦克車由唐橋向南猛衝、激戰終日在馬橋宅之處、遭我軍堅强之痛擊、並被我擊燬三輛後、知不能逞、乃卽退去、入夜、盛家宅湖裏宅兩處之戰事、又趨激烈、敵由黃港葛家牌樓西犯惟亦遭遇嚴重之打擊、我軍堅守原陣、雖在砲火彈雨之下、絕不稍却、而公路東首沿浜之沈家灣·陸宅·膏荏橋宅·敵以猛攻未逞、故昨夜起又以猛烈之砲火轟擊甚久、其部隊以進襲數次、但我每次均予以迎頭痛擊後、將敵逐退、我軍現在南岸之陣綫、堅固異常、由公路東之沈家灣·陸宅·膏荏橋宅·蘇家橋宅·馬橋宅、越公路而西至季項宅·陳家宅·郁家宅·以至湖裏宅·盛家宅各重要據點、均密切聯絡、堅如磐石、固若金湯、而生力軍亦配置就緒、已開始反攻、今晨起、大砲之聲、已逐漸向北遠去、</p>
<h3>敵大批援軍將到滬</h3>
<p>期於九國公約會議前　進據前淞滬恊定區域</p>
<p>日方為轉移國際視綫及挽回國譽起見、擬在本月三十日九國公約會議開幕以前、限令攻克以前淞滬恊定以內非駐兵區域、故已另由陸軍省增調三師團以上之軍隊、約五萬餘人來滬參戰、聞該批援軍、將於二十六日到滬、</p>
<p>敵長谷川、於十七日上午在虹口蓬路日本人俱樂部、召集會議、到有原田·大川·內尾·田松永·及軍隊指揮官等二十餘人、其討論內容為㊀此役兵力集中地點、㊁防禦我軍空襲方針、㊂務須積極占領大塲等計劃、</p>
<p>日駐華大使館秘書淸水、於本月十三日離滬返日、當其動身之前、曾與英美法各國領事接洽、而後成行、聞該淸水返日之使命、大半為設立上海中立區之問題、</p>
<h3>敵艦又向浦東開砲</h3>
<p>掩護敵輪竊燃料</p>
<p>停泊九號浮筒之敵砲艦一艘、於今晨（二十日）八時左右、突又向我浦東發砲、猛烈轟擊、同時另有敵小輪三艘、徐徐駛靠浦東新三井碼頭、企圖登陸、竊取該處煤棧之燃料、我守軍洞燭其奸、於敵艦開砲時、皆置之不理、靜待敵小輪逼近岸旁後、遂以機關槍密集掃射、敵見我早有凖備、相率倉皇遁去、惟已被我射擊死傷十餘人、</p>
<h3>南翔擊落敵機續報</h3>
<p>墜於楊柳橋人機俱焚</p>
<p>南翔我軍擊落敵機一架、已誌今晨本報、惟詳細情形未明、茲據中央社蘇州十九日電、始悉擊落地點所在、茲列如下、十九日午後四時三十分、有敵輕轟炸機六架飛南翔馬陸鎮一帶肆虐、當被我高射砲擊落一架、墜於楊柳橋、人機均焚、並拾得機關槍一挺、尙有三架被我高射砲擊傷、餘機見勢不佳、倉惶向東逃去、</p>
<h3>敵方輜重結儲虹口</h3>
<p>乍浦路本願寺藏大批軍火及砲位　虹口總指揮部設施高塔路女學內</p>
<p>據確息、虹口乍浦路本願寺（日本佛敎寺院）為敵軍重要軍事機關之一、寺內大殿下闢有地道、儲藏大量軍火、駐砲兵三百名、置有重砲位兩門、屋頂架設高射砲兩尊、高射機關槍兩挺、又西華德路南洋兄弟烟草公司亦設有砲位、</p>
<p>滬東平凉路一帶、自華興路至平凉路底止、凡華租交界之各小路口、均被敵方埋設地雷甚多、</p>
<p>虹口施高塔路日本女子小學、於本月十一日起、已為敵軍作虹口區指揮部、敵軍近來運到大批竹梯及木板編成之木排、堆積軍工路、高爾夫球塲臨江處以備作登岸之用、</p>
<h3>轟炸閘北無損工事</h3>
<p>路局大厦頂層中彈焚燬一角</p>
<p>我軍右翼閘北陣地、工事堅若金城、敵雖屢次進犯、均受重創、反為我衝達北四川路口、控制敵軍在北四川路一帶之自由活動能力、敵知閘北各綫之不可犯、乃採行轟炸政策、連日以來、敵機四出在閘北一帶轟炸、昨日又有敵機數隊往返在寶山路之西北、投擲重量炸彈、而北站兩路管理局大厦、更為彼等之目標、川流向該厦投彈、當為擊中數彈、其最高之一層、因此起火、內中所儲藏之行李票存根等、冲天飛出、延燒至晚、即行熄滅、查該厦係完全水泥鋼骨所建、故雖燃燒終日、僅將該厦最高層東北部之一部儲藏物燒燬、其他各省、均未波及、更以我軍早知敵方必师一二八故智、轟炸閘北、故工事及有關軍事之設備、均佈置週密而神秘、虽將閘北炸成平地、亦無礙於我之軍防、是以連日敵機雖不斷轟炸、僅燬及民房、我軍事上之設備、則無絲毫之損害也、今晨敵機又出活動、但已不若數日前擲彈之多、故日來除日機轟炸外、前綫戰事、極吿沉寂、僅偶有步哨之警戒槍聲而已、</p>
<h3>川越今晨晤長谷川</h3>
<p>今日上午七時半許、川樾茂又偕同參贊淸水等由畢勛路寓所乘車至虹口與敵軍指揮官長谷川松井眞崎等會見、聽取前綫戰事消息之報吿、並商討外交等問題、直至八時五十分、始乘原車經外白渡橋而返法租界寓所、</p>
<h3>川島芳子來滬活動</h3>
<p>敵關東軍、日前派國際間諜份子川島芳子、及中日女子多人來滬活動、現悉在某處設有情報機關、刺探蘇聯情報、該處負責人為白俄法西斯重要份子萬夏斯基、其手下有白俄多人、在滬活動、</p>
<h3>敵傷兵醫院已人滿</h3>
<p>可見戰事激烈之一般</p>
<p>據華東社記者探悉、敵軍虹口區域內設有傷兵醫院十一所、北四川路之福民醫院、並未作軍用、現已停止、最近兩日十一處均已人滿、醫師凑手不及醫治、故前昨兩日、用輪載送回國者甚多、於此可證明近日戰事激烈之一般矣、</p>
<h3>晉東敵受重創我軍收復新舊關</h3>

<p>虹橋</p>
<p>今日清晨五時計、時正黎明、滬西虹橋鎮小菜塲、適因菜蔬上市、鄕民廢集甚衆、以作賣買、竟復突遭敵機三架濫施轟炸、當被投擲重彈五六枚、各鄕民因連日遭受敵機肆虐、早已預防躲避、故死傷僅有十餘人、</p>
<p>擔今晨泗涇來人談、報載敵機昨飛往該鎮投彈云云、謂並無其事、</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>敵機暴行又一鐵證</p>
<p>自淞滬抗戰援敵机到处肆虐視為日常功課。乃殘殺我平民之不足。甚至炸傷駐華英大使許閣森爵士。經英政府提出嚴重抗議。彼方以無法狡辯。方始道歉了事。詎不多日英大使館航空上尉馬瑞等。又被襲擊。此案尚在交涉中。不料昨日。義大使館武官利比齊及德籍人員。又在蘇州道中被炸。雖未受傷然已飽受虛驚。夫義德二國為我友邦。亦為彼之與國。今其官商。尚不免於被轟。似此瘋狂。必為全球所唾棄。外交益陷孤立。行將自召覆亡而已。</p>

<h3>從天津到上海</h3>
<p>一個被壓迫者述經過</p>
<p>（特訊）平津陷落、瞬將三月、友人楊君、經商華北、已十有餘年、自敵人佔據天津、全家在敵人鐵蹄下、備受非人生的虐待屢遭抄查逮捕、九死一生至上星期一、始得化裝苦力、由津乘英輪來滬途行七日、歷盡艱辛、到滬之日、與記者會見自謂冉生矣、所談北方情形、其有為已成過去之事者則不載、今將其南下狀况、擷記一二、</p>

<p>七天海行痛苦</p>
<p>這兩月中、從平律逃出的人、至少有二十萬、其中大半是到烟臺上岸、再轉往豫魯·陝·晋各省、亦有到靑島上陸者而至上海者亦甚多但購買船票、非常艱難、楊君直至本月十日、方始買到太古之海口輪統艙舖位一個、化了二十元的代價、祇可在露天的甲板上、占一個人的地位由天津到上海、足足的走了七天七夜、旅客的痛苦、正不堪言狀了、船過塘沽口、舉目所見敵軍的子彈·砲彈·和炸彈、從運輸艦裝到堆積在碼頭、船到烟臺、留一日夜、因停拋海邊、旅客不能上陸、直至船抵靑島我人方得上岸、目前靑島已成了一個死市居民大少、日夜的嚴密防備敵機空襲、</p>
<p>淞滬所見現狀</p>
<p>海口輪駛到吳淞口外、是在中午、楊君在北方時、不能得知上海的戰事眞相、所以船過裹鍋沙、他便在甲板上遙望、已可看見敵人侵犯我淞滬的軍艦、自裹銅沙起一直至吳淞口、每隔一段、即泊有一艦、大小不一、共有近四十艘之譜、其中有若干艘敵艦、看得出是方從日本開來的、艦內滿載軍隊和軍械、其吃水陷到載重綫上、可證艦中載物之多也、吳淞口以內、到白渡橋止、敵艦疏疏落落、約有十七八艘、二號浮筒前的出雲、四周用大鐵駁包圍艦上滿是沙袋甚至烟囪亦用電網布蔽進淞口、最觸目驚心的、吳淞至蕰藻浜一帶、昔日鱗次櫛比的工廠堆棧等偉大建築、今已全放斷垣頹壁、無一完好之星、極目縱望、一片亂碟塲、在虬江碼頭東曠地上、敵方的軍馬有一二千匹、來而不能用、又運輸卡車數百輛浦江內的平頭小兵駁、為我人素不經見者、今則觸處皆是、蕰藻浜一帶、更有大批木排、各碼頭停泊的商船所改之運輸輪正在忙亂山卸軍械裝運傷兵、</p>
<p>刦掠民船貨物</p>
<p>這次同輪來上海的旅客中有從烟台下船的二十五人、均紹與籍據各人言彼等向在上海至北洋一路、裝運客貨有大沙船（各載量六百噸）兩艘、船東周姓、此回運載兩船貨件在本月初駛到烟台海面、即被敵艦扣去、船貨盡被沒收、甚至船員的行李·衣物·銀錢、亦掃數搜刮一空、並欲將二船的全體二十五人、活活燒死後經一再哀求、乃被綁閉於船內、餓了四天方始放一舳板將二十五人逐上龍口、臨放時身上剝剩一單衫幸而各人在烟台有客家熟識、勉强凑借了四百元略購衣服以三百餘元買了船票、遂得生回、但船貨兩項損失共在五萬元以上、楊君登陸後、在觀察上海情形之後奮然謂記者曰、南中處處表現出我民族力量的偉大、軍民團結的堅靭、戰事前途必操勝券、本人三個月來在北方感受壓迫到不能舒氣、至今日一到上海、胸中積憤始得為之一暢也、（心危）</p>

<p>陳述對中日爭端意見及期望</p>
<p>國際問題研究會、昨日電致九國公約各簽字國、陳述我國對中日爭端之意見、以及我國國民在九國公約開會前之期望、該電由該會名譽董事顏惠慶董事黎照寰劉湛恩董顯光陳光甫·錢新之·何德奎·戴志騫等簽署·原電略謂、“華府九國公約、即將在比利時京城開會、敝會職責所在、爰發表下列聲明、俾將日本侵入我國所涉及之重要法律上及政治上問題、予以說明焉目前之衝突、實質上為一九三一年日本侵入滿洲之延續、日本自囊括滿洲及熱河在該處樹立偽政府後、復開始種種活動、運用陰謀與武力、使華北脫離中國統治而獨立、日本在平津亳無合法理由增加其駐軍、較一九零一年辛丑條約許可之數量、竟多出四倍之多、過去吾人、尚可憶及自中國政府遷都南京以及各國駐中國使節駐在地之遷移後、外國駐軍保衛自北平至海岸鐵路綫之重要性業已减少、日本軍閥竟悍然不顧、在華北集結重軍、並在辛丑條約條款所絕不允許之地點、時時舉行演習、因此遂有七月八日與我蘆溝橋駐軍衝突之事件發生、中國政府曾竭盡全力謀獲得和平解决、甚至撤退我國軍隊、惟日本則仍按照其預定計劃、將其軍事行動、擴展至冀察綏晋魯五省、其面積達七十萬方哩、並進而武力佔據平津及海河、目為徹底遂行其武力克服中國之政策、及與華北戰事取得連絡起見、復在我財政及經濟中心之上海、掀起戰事、圖一舉而擊破我國抵抗之力量、於是遂藉口虹橋事件、（該事件係日本武裝水兵、圖於八月九日闖入我國飛機塲所引起）、於四十八小時內、在上海集中鉅大艦隊、並有大批軍隊登陸、即向公共租界外之閘北大舉進攻、日本在中國廣袤土地內從事軍事行動、已逾三月之久、决不能謂為自衛、且應視日本違反九國公約及非戰公約下所負之義務、前者約東各簽字國、須尊重中國之土地及行政完整、後者譴斥以戰爭為國策之工具、至於上海事件所涉及之法理問題、乃一九三二年之淞滬停戰恊定也、惟在滬戰發生前、日本在沿公共租界邊境、建築巨大砲壘、在八字橋駐紮軍隊、事實上該恊定早已爲日方所破壞、中國政府因鑒於日本侵入華北及其作戰之險謀、爲履行保衛本國領土之主要責任起見、乃被迫下令軍隊之必要動員、此種舉動、絕未違反淞滬停戰恊定、何况該恊定從未有永遠限制中國軍隊、在中國領土內行動之規定、職是之故、上海所發生如日軍侵入華北同類之未宣而戰之戰事、其責任必須由日方負之也再則自戰事發生以來、日本軍閥用盡種種方法、蹂躪我國海港、宣佈非法封鎖我國全部海岸、運用現代戰爭之種種機械化武器恣意轟炸我國城市我全國都市幾全遭日機之肆虐、大批無辜平民、包括難民婦孺、均慘遭屠殺學校醫院等文化機關多遭毀壞、凡此種種、已引起全世界人士之震駭與痛恨、殊無贅述之必要、日本在理論上、現尚與中國保持和平、惟即使正式宣戰、日本之行動、亦已違反海牙和平會議决議案第廿五條、即禁止轟炸不設防之城市等等、以及一致公認之戰時國際公法內分別非戰鬥員與戰鬥員之原則、再則日本航空人員、轟炸紅十字會救護隊、更屬可恥、蓋違反一九二九年日內瓦恊定也、綜觀上述種種情勢、吾人不得不下一結論、即日本現正繼續其一九三一年在滿洲開始之大陸侵略計劃、中國旣為日本以最殘暴方式侵略之犧牲者、除竭盡全力抵抗外、別無他途可循吾人深信遠東和平影響全世界和平條約之尊嚴、必予恢復、而國家之安全必須屬集體性質、是故吾人僅向參加行將開會之九國公約會議各國、作將伯之呼籲、不使此日本對中國之侵略、樹立危險之先例、而斷然採取一致行動、包含有效之制裁措置、以對付侵略國云、</p>

<h3>抗戰必勝的信念</h3>
<p>— 郭我力</p>
<p>近年來日軍閥為了牠要升官發財，不惜把我們大好河山，生命財產，當做牠們刀俎間的魚肉，想一塊塊的宰割，滿足其貪婪無厭的慾壑，東北四省吞噬後，又繼續企圖華北，甚而華中華南了。</p>
<p>破壞一切罰球和平條約，藐視必遵守的公法，逞其堅甲利兵，盡量發揮其强盜性格，企滅我整個中華而後快，現在全面抗戰展開了，五旬來拚殺的戰續，暴露了敵賊的弱點和醜熊，事實吿訴我們唯有抗戰到底，犧牲到底，才能得到民族眞正的解放和最後的光榮！</p>
<p>我們誓死抗戰已取得了國際的同情，轉移了國際的態度，由精神的贊助，將來必然會演進到實力的援應，至少或能澈底予敵以經濟的封鎖，那就是牠的致命傷，不怕怎樣强悍，必然的要趨於崩潰。</p>
<p>求人不如求己，我們固然迫切的希望國際的援助，同是還是要踔勵奮發，不能倚賴，最後勝利屬於我，不是空洞的誇大，在國力的對比上，就可看出能操必勝的充分理由，現在的戰爭，如果缺乏了經濟的重要條件，前途的確是悲觀的，敵人為一蕞爾小島，先天不足，民生軍用等工業原料，都要仰給於國際，我國地大物博，寶藏豐富，向被觀為生命綫，過去以人心沉迷，政治不上軌道，雖未有充分的開發，現在一面支持長久的抗戰，一面發動大規模的戰時開拓天然富源，同時訓練民衆，組織民衆，武裝民衆，戮力同心，急起直追，隨時隨地，都能予以打擊者以嚴重打擊，莫說一蕞爾小島，十個八個又焉足畏？</p>
<p>我們更要透澈本身，自一致精誠團結後，在忠勇為國的最高統帥的領導下，整齊步伐，已形成了銅墻鐵壁的陳線，那怕排山倒海之力，都不足以挫撓我們的抗戰的壁壘，何况敵人內體失調，機構不健咧？古語：“嗜殺者必致於殺身”歷史上一些窮兵黷武者的結果，都不免於崩潰，日軍閥侵華的最後階段，就可斷定了。</p>
<p>靑年為民衆的前鋒，尤其是知識的靑年，乃民衆的敢死隊，所以我們要完成這民族解放的神聖事業，必須先要有這堅决的抗戰必勝的信念，領導民衆作殊死的戰鬥。</p>

        <h1>1937.10.20</h1>
<h3>Fierce Bloody Battle North of Datong; We Launched a Full-Scale Counteroffensive with Strict Interception</h3>
<p>We launched a fierce attack in the Huanggang and Hulizhai areas, gaining the upper hand. The enemy attacked at Yujiazhai and Jixiangzhai in the B line but were repelled. Our air force bombed the enemy positions south of the Wenzaobang Canal last night.</p>
<p>The enemy from Heida Huangzhai to Qiangmentouzhai on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal, after their general offensive on the 12th failed, reinforced and supplemented their forces and launched another attack on the 14th. However, they encountered strong resistance from our army everywhere, resulting in three days and nights of bloody battles. At the cost of 3,000 casualties, they advanced two kilometers south to Gejiapailou. After our counteroffensive, the enemy suffered heavy losses. Both sides advanced and retreated, with extremely heavy casualties. At 1:00 PM on the 18th, the enemy, under the cover of airplanes, artillery, and tanks, fiercely attacked our Huanggang positions. Our army, disregarding their own safety, charged into battle, fiercely attacking the enemy with guns and knives for two hours. Both sides suffered significant damage. However, because the enemy's artillery fire was too fierce, our reinforcements could not arrive in time, so the position was slightly breached. After nightfall, our fresh troops joined the battle and launched several counteroffensives. The fierce fighting continued until late last night (the 19th). At the same time, our army, according to the original plan, strengthened its forces on both flanks, waiting for an opportunity to attack from both sides. The enemy, knowing they could not continue to advance, used all their strength to attack the Liuhang-Datong highway line. Yesterday, all day and night, there were several fierce battles along both sides of the highway, with artillery fire filling the sky and casualties everywhere. The intensity of the battle was unprecedented. Although some of our army's positions were breached by the enemy, reinforcements arrived continuously and are currently launching a fierce counteroffensive. According to a front-line report received by this newspaper at 2:00 AM this morning, our army has a significant advantage. The stubborn enemy has penetrated deeply and has been strictly surrounded and blocked by us, and the situation should be resolved within days.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent reported at 10:30 AM on the 19th that the enemy entrenched in Gejiapailou, starting at 1:00 PM on the 18th, used a strong force of 700 to 800 men to fiercely attack Huanggang, which is more than 100 meters away from Gejiapailou. At that time, enemy planes and artillery continuously bombed our front lines. Our army braved the artillery fire and launched an attack, engaging the enemy in hand-to-hand combat. The fighting lasted for two hours, and both sides suffered very heavy casualties. Our reinforcements were hindered by enemy planes, making it difficult to advance, so the position was breached by the enemy at one point. After nightfall, our fresh troops joined the battle, greatly boosting morale. After several counterattacks, they were quite successful, and by 2:00 AM this morning, they had approached Fengcuntang. However, the enemy suffered this setback and became extremely panicked, so they launched another large-scale attack. After dawn, under the combined firepower of land and air forces, they attacked us again. Due to the overwhelming momentum, our Huanggang stronghold was eventually lost.</p>
<p>Enemy's Attack on Hulizhai Heavily Obstructed by Us</p>
<p>At the same time, another thousand or so enemies, together with the troops attacking Huanggang, jointly attacked Xihuai, attacking our Hulizhai-Sujiazhai line. Our army was well-prepared, and upon seeing the enemy attacking, immediately bravely met them. One of our brigade commanders directed the battle despite being wounded, and his morale was very high. Although they suffered casualties under the pressure of enemy planes, they continued to fight bravely without retreating. The bloody battle lasted until night, and with the assistance of the rear troops, they launched a fierce counteroffensive, stopping the enemy's advance. As of the time of the company's war correspondent's second report at night, the fighting was still ongoing. Also, the enemy at Bashiqiaozhai was also actively attacking west, so there was all-day fierce fighting at Zhangjialou and Dingjiazhai. However, our army is determined to perish with the position, and will never let them easily gain a single village or a single house.</p>
<p>Our Two Companies Sacrificed at Huangjiazhai</p>
<p>The enemy's objective in attacking south is to capture Datong, in order to attack the flanks of our Miaohang-Jiangwan positions. Their route of attack initially went via the highway, but that failed. Then they advanced to the west of the road, but due to the crisscrossing of ports and rivers, heavy weapons lost their effectiveness, and they suffered heavy losses. Therefore, today they attacked the highway again. First, at dawn, they used about 30 tanks to form a column at Tangqiao, covering the advance of a large force. At about 7:00 AM, they advanced about 800 meters and were driven back by us. The enemy then divided its forces into one part and eight vehicles, attacking our Huangjiazhai to the west of the road and Gaozhenqiaozhai to the east of the road. Our army at Huangjiazhai only had two companies. The enemy avoided the main point and attacked that point with all their strength. Our army still bravely held out for two hours, until 11:00 AM, when they all made heroic sacrifices.</p>
<p>Enemy Continues Southward Advance, Fierce Battle Repelled</p>
<p>After breaking through our Huangjiazhai line, that enemy force advanced again about 800 meters south, attacking our Sujiaqiaozhai to the east of the road. It was also critical at one point, but after reinforcements arrived and fought a bloody battle, the enemy eventually failed and retreated. Also, about 10 enemy vehicles attacked Maqiaozhai, which is about 1,900 meters away from Tangqiao. After we bombarded them with flat-trajectory guns, the enemy vehicles were damaged and also retreated immediately. There was also a force that attacked the Yujiazhai-Jixiangzhai line to the east at about 7:00 PM. Our army launched an attack, and the fierce fighting began. As of the time of the report at 10:00 PM, our army was still holding the original position.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Two Places East of the Highway</p>
<p>East of the highway along the Wenzaobang Canal, the enemy occupied Jiangjiaxinzhai and Yanjiawan and was also active yesterday. The enemy at Jiangjiaxinzhai attacked Zhouchengzhai near the northwest at noon, but their troops were weak, so after our counterattack, they fled in disarray. We intercepted two machine guns and more than 30 rifles. The enemy at Yanjiawan then attacked our Gujiazhai, Yangzhai, and Ziyangbang lines to the east, but there were only a hundred or so of them, and they were no match for our army's attack, so they fled in panic. Looking at the situation of the fierce fighting throughout the day, the enemy's attempt to attack Datong to the south is very obvious. However, we have strong strongholds everywhere, especially to hold the highway line. Therefore, in this area of only 4,000 meters in length and width, the enemy has gathered the strength of more than one division, and after a week of bloody fighting, there is still no progress. Currently, we have completed the deployment of our positions, and we are about to launch a full-scale counteroffensive according to the pre-arranged plan.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Still Attempts a Central Breakthrough, Advancing Towards Our Guangfu Position</h3>
<p>We Have Prepared Heavy Troops to Meet Them with a Head-On Blow</p>
<p>The enemy army has been fiercely attacking in the area south of the Wenzaobang Canal, fighting bloody battles for many days, with advances and retreats on both sides. The gain or loss of each village has been more than several times, so both sides have suffered heavy sacrifices. According to those familiar with military affairs, this kind of move by the enemy is actually a feint to the east and attack to the west. The enemy in the Guangfu area, after receiving reinforcements last night, has already begun to fully attack our Guangfu area positions, attempting to achieve their central breakthrough plan. Therefore, they first feign an attack on the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal to shift our army's target. Our army has long seen through their plan and has massed heavy troops in the Guangfu area, increasing our strength. If the enemy attacks, we will definitely meet them with a head-on blow.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Guangfu reported at 9:30 AM on the 19th that the enemy used artillery to bombard our entire Guangfu north-south line of positions in the areas of Laoluzhai, Xinmuqiao, Nanmeizhai, and Wannianqiao. The artillery fire was dense, stretching for more than 2,000 meters. It started last night and only stopped this morning. The enemy's move was to prevent our counteroffensive and to relieve the main force attacking Chenjiaxiang from the worry of being attacked from the rear. Our army saw through their trick, so we are waiting in a strict formation, looking for an opportunity to attack in order to achieve a pincer attack. Also, according to the confession of the enemy lieutenant Weisanlang captured by our army, the enemy who has been fiercely attacking our Guangfu area in the areas north of Guangfu, Nanmeizhai, Beimeizhai, and Tangzhai for many days are the 43rd and 44th regiments of the 11th Division. The enemy in the Xinmuqiao area near Guangfu is the 33rd Regiment of the 9th Division.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Bombed Wenzaobang</h3>
<p>Last night, the blue sky danced with clouds, and the bright moon was clear. Our loyal air force dispatched again to assist in the battle. At 10:30 PM, the sound of planes could be faintly heard in the skies over Shanghai. The enemy ships in the Huangpu River desperately searched with searchlights. However, our air force flew to the south bank of the Wenzaobang Canal to bomb the enemy's positions, so they did not approach the Shanghai skies, and the enemy ships did not fire.</p>
<h3>Our Army Attacked Sijing Ballfield</h3>
<p>No Contact Continued in Zhabei from Yesterday</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 1:00 AM on the 20th that the enemy in the city center remained dormant and did not come out all day. At 5:30 PM, we used a part of our forces, divided from the Municipal Cemetery, Hejiaxiang, and Jiajiazhai, to attack the Sijing Ballfield. The enemy used tanks to cover the infantry to meet the battle. Our machine gun teams then advanced with dense gunfire. After four hours of stalemate, the enemy had more than 150 casualties, but they were still stubbornly resisting. At 11:00 AM, the enemy was finally unable to hold on and retreated to the trenches under the cover of tanks, and fiercely bombarded us with guns and artillery. We scattered in the wilderness, waiting for an opportunity to charge.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Zhabei reported at 1:00 AM on the 20th that yesterday, on the entire line from the North Railway Station to Bazibqiao in Zhabei, except for enemy planes dropping bombs and occasionally bombarding us with artillery, there was no contact. The Lianglu Administration Building has been the target of concentrated bombardment by enemy artillery and planes since August 13th, leaving it with numerous wounds. At 4:30 PM yesterday afternoon, it was again hit by an enemy incendiary bomb, and the third floor immediately caught fire and smoked. It was extinguished in the evening, and the body of the building did not collapse.</p>
<h3>Enemy Plane Shot Down in Nanxiang</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency war correspondent in Jiangwan reported at 10:00 PM on the 19th that at 4:00 PM this afternoon, an enemy plane was hit by our anti-aircraft artillery while dropping bombs in Nanxiang and crashed near the XX Bridge on the XX highway. The fuselage was destroyed, and the crew members were also killed.</p>
<h3>Our Army Absolutely Did Not Use Poison Gas</h3>
<p>Our Military Spokesperson Solemnly Denies</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese side's false accusation that we used a large amount of poison gas on the front lines, our military spokesperson solemnly denied it yesterday at a reception for journalists, saying that since the August 13th Incident occurred, our army has never used poison gas or committed inhumane acts. The spokesperson also said that our army has never even thought about using poison gas to retaliate against the Japanese army's atrocities.</p>
<h3>Sudden Explosion at Tokyo Ordnance Factory</h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun of the 8th of this month, at 1:30 AM on the 6th, a fire suddenly broke out at the electric detonator assembly factory of the Tokyo Ordnance Industry Factory at No. 555, 1-chome, Nakadai-machi, Shimura, Itabashi-ku, Tokyo, and spread to the detonators, resulting in three explosions, one after another. The sound was heard for several miles, and nearby houses were violently shaken, and the glass windows were all shattered. Residents woke up in shock and were extremely panicked. The factory was founded by Matsukata Goro and was very large, with a total of eight factories, occupying an area of several tens of acres, all of which have been completely destroyed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Ships Bombarded the Riverbank at Baimao</h3>
<p>Enemy ships outside Baimaokou suddenly bombarded our riverbank positions again at 3:00 AM yesterday morning (the 19th). Our army waited in a strict formation, but the enemy immediately stopped bombarding and had no intention of landing.</p>
<h3>Vice President Kong Discusses His Impressions of the Mission</h3>
<p>Thanking Friendly Nations for Their Kindness; Commending Overseas Compatriots for Their Patriotism — More Than a Hundred Trade Unions Sent Telegrams to Congratulate Kong</p>
<p>Vice President Kong arrived in Shanghai by boat from Hong Kong at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. Yesterday, reporters visited him again and asked him to share his impressions of attending the coronation ceremony in England, inspecting economic construction in various European and American countries, and passing through various places on his return to China. He gave the following statement:</p>
<p>I was ordered to represent our country in England at the coronation of the British Emperor, and took the opportunity to visit various countries to continue the mission of economic construction inspection from five years ago. I was extremely delighted to meet and talk with people from all walks of life in friendly nations. In particular, wherever I went, I was deeply moved by the enthusiastic welcome and sincere hospitality of friendly nations and our overseas compatriots. I deeply understand that such grand reception was given to me not because of personal affection, but because I belong to the most ancient civilized country, which is also recently advancing on the path of construction. Therefore, they showed respect to my country, and I just happened to be present at the occasion. Therefore, I would like to express my personal gratitude here, and also represent the country to pay tribute to all friendly nations.</p>
<p>When I attended the coronation of the British Emperor in England, I deeply felt that the solemn ceremony showed that the United Kingdom has a well-organized government above and a united and consolidated public below, which can integrate people of different races and territories scattered across countries into one, with seamless cooperation. It is fitting that the demeanor of a great power is admired by the world. In France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, the United States, and other countries, from government parties to social leaders, all those I contacted expressed goodwill towards our inherent culture and emerging industries. They especially trusted the progress of our country's economic construction in recent years. Therefore, some were willing to cooperate with us in economic affairs, and some were willing to provide us with assistance. All of this has already been seen in the news media and need not be repeated. If such kindness and support can be calmly implemented, the progress of the country will be immeasurable. Unfortunately, we are envied by the enemy, and aggression is imminent. An unavoidable war finally broke out, which affected our construction plans. This is truly heartbreaking. Here, in addition to doing our best to continue progress, we should express our deep gratitude to all friendly nations that cooperate with and assist us economically.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, I originally intended to expedite my return home, but there were still many international matters that needed to be dealt with, so I could not leave immediately. At the same time, I also believed that the major military and political plans in the country, under the leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, have been arranged properly, and the finance and economy that I am in charge of have also become stable due to the Central Government's active preparations and the people's enthusiastic maintenance in recent years. Moreover, transportation is convenient now, and I can still command and respond calmly from abroad, so I delayed until now before returning. As for the observations of people from all countries on the Sino-Japanese War, there is a definite judgment of right and wrong. However, at first, they were still observing and did not want to express their opinions easily. But in the past two months, on the one hand, our soldiers have been loyal and brave in resisting the war and sacrificing themselves heroically, making the enemy unable to implement their plans and recognizing that we have the ability to regenerate ourselves. On the other hand, the enemy has bombed our undefended cities, brutally killed our non-combatant people, and violated world humanitarianism, so there have been concrete expressions and actions of sympathy and assistance. It can be seen that respecting virtue and loving peace are the natural qualities of human beings. Those who destroy virtue and disrupt peace are the common enemies of mankind. As the saying goes, public opinion is fair. This shows that our ancient sages had the maxim of conquering people with virtue, and Premier Sun Yat-sen left behind the teaching of building the country with peace. Therefore, morality and peace are the basic tenets of our inherent Eastern culture. The Japanese nation has been immersed in Eastern culture for thousands of years, and the majority of their people must respect virtue and love peace. Unfortunately, they are temporarily held hostage by a small number of tyrannical warlords and can do nothing. If all countries that love peace and uphold justice impose effective sanctions on these Japanese warlords who destroy virtue and disrupt peace, it is believed that enlightened people in Japan will also rise up and work for the morality and peace of mankind.</p>
<p>During this return trip, I saw overseas compatriots from all walks of life in Singapore, Manila, and Hong Kong donating to the national cause. In particular, those in the middle and lower classes of industry and commerce are more enthusiastic. Even those who carry burdens on their shoulders donate the entire income of three days to the government. Their patriotic enthusiasm is commendable. Overseas compatriots are like this, so those of us who are born, grow up, eat, and live in this country should know what to strive for.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I arrived in the city from Wusong. Seeing the damage caused by the enemy on both sides of the Huangpu River, I can understand the bloody battles and sacrifices of our patriotic soldiers on the front lines. The damage and suffering suffered by the people in various parts of our rear are truly unbearable to see and sympathize with. However, buying more can beautify our country, and resisting foreign aggression is the only way to survive. Whether our nation and country can stand tall in today's world will be decided in this war. At this critical juncture of life and death, I sincerely hope that the entire country will work together with one heart, with the determination to sacrifice to the end, in order to win the final victory. This will not only save our country, but also preserve virtue for mankind and guarantee peace for the world. The significance is extremely important.</p>
<p>One hundred and seventy-three trade associations in this city, including the silk and satin industry, cotton cloth industry, timber industry, paper industry, national goods rubber industry, pawn industry, inland river shipping industry, rice shop industry, sugar industry, flour mill industry, miscellaneous grain and oil cake industry, hardware industry, knitting industry, ginseng and bird's nest industry, new silk industry, pharmaceutical factory industry, color printing industry, wool industry, department store industry, fruit industry, feihua industry, and chemical raw materials industry, sent a telegram of respect yesterday when they heard that Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, had returned to China after completing his official duties. The text reads: "Addressed to His Excellency Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan: Your triumphant return is a cause for celebration throughout the country. We admire your outstanding efforts in coordinating and managing finances. At this time when the war is unfolding, the nation's finances depend on your planning, and the industry and finance sector needs more support. Your heavy responsibility and long-term vision are deeply admired. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect. We hope that you will consider it. respectfully, from the Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry and 173 other trade associations."</p>
<h3>The Righteous Army Shot and Injured Workers; We Lodged a Second Protest</h3>
<p>The first protest's reply from the Italian side was evasive. Mayor Yu Sent Another Letter to the Italian Consul General Requesting a Reply</p>
<p>Regarding the case last month in which the Italian garrison shot and injured workers crossing the Suzhou River, including Cai Zihong, Mayor Yu had lodged a serious protest with the Italian Consul General Neroni, as previously reported. However, the wording of the Italian side's reply was evasive. It is reported that Mayor Yu has lodged a second protest. The full text of the letter is as follows: "Sir Consul, your letter of the 6th of this month has been duly received. However, this Mayor still finds it difficult to accept the various points made in your letter. The reasons are hereby stated again as follows: Upon investigation, the sampan crossing the river at the time was in the early morning, and those on board were all workers commonly crossing the river, who could be easily identified by the guarding garrison. Moreover, the first sampan crossing the river had been allowed to dock. Why was the second group of workers suddenly rejected, causing those crossing the river to be at a loss as to what to do? This point has already been mentioned in this Mayor's previous letter. Furthermore, when your country's soldiers stopped them from advancing, it was difficult for Chinese workers who did not understand your country's language to understand or comply with the orders issued in Italian by your country's patrol. However, the soldier did not use other methods to stop them, but instead opened fire and shot, which was an excessive act and should be held responsible for intentional injury. As for whether your country's soldiers have a treaty basis for exercising their powers in the so-called defense zone, this will not be discussed here for the time being. However, there has been no clear indication of the various restrictions imposed in that area. Even if the workers whose profession is labor have a slight misunderstanding, it is a matter of common sense. Therefore, the claim in your letter that residents in the area were already clear about the crossing points is even more one-sided. The reasons cited in your letter for why your country's soldiers had to open fire are insufficient. Therefore, this Mayor believes that the responsibility for this incident should be borne entirely by your country's soldiers. The two innocent Chinese cannot be blamed. In accordance with the foregoing, I am writing to reply, and I hope that you will refer to this Mayor's letter of the 30th of last month, handle the matter separately, and reply as soon as possible. This is addressed to His Excellency Neroni, Italian Consul General stationed in Shanghai."</p>
<h3>German Residential Buildings Were Destroyed by Enemy Planes; The German Consul Lodges a Protest</h3>
<p>German Properties All Displayed Their National Flags; The Enemy Army Disregarded the Facts and Bombed Them</p>
<p>On the 14th of this month (last Thursday), several enemy planes flew to the Hongqiao Road area and indiscriminately bombed it. Four German residential buildings in that area were also hit by enemy bombs. Some of them were partially bombed, and some were completely destroyed. The German Consul General in Shanghai protested to the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai for this bombing, pointing out that the German houses in that area all displayed the German flag on the roof, which was very obvious. The Japanese disregarded this fact and bombed them, so the lives and properties of German residents in Shanghai were also threatened. In addition, he also protested to Mayor Yu, saying that the passenger cars parked on the railway near Hongqiao Road were very close to the German houses, thus endangering the properties of the German residents. There was no special military reason for parking these vehicles there, so he specifically asked for attention and to move these vehicles to a place that would not harm the properties and lives of the German residents. According to German sources, the statement made by the Japanese spokesman that this German protest was only submitted to the Chinese side is completely inaccurate. The German Consul General, in addition to lodging a protest with the Chinese authorities, also sent a protest note to the Japanese authorities.</p>

<p>Enemy Troops Launch Fierce Attacks on Us in Three Routes; Tuanchengkou and Dongpaochi Have Been Recaptured; The Enemy's Advance on Jiuguan in Eastern Shanxi is Very Urgent; We Fight to the Death to Resist and Repel the Enemy</p>

The detachment launched a surprise attack. The enemy responded in a panic. After half an hour of fighting, approximately 200 vehicles opened from Yangmingbao North, also fully loaded with enemy troops. Seeing their comrades surrounded, they dismounted one after another and launched a pincer attack on our detachment. Subsequently, four enemy aircraft arrived to provide assistance. Our detachment moved nimbly and dealt with the situation calmly. The enemy was exhausted, and suffered heavy casualties. We also destroyed more than 20 of their vehicles. Heavy fighting was continuing as of dusk that day. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 19th)</p>

<p>[Taiyuan] A reporter went to northern Shanxi for inspection on the 15th and returned to Bing [Taiyuan] on the morning of the 19th. The following is a record of the actual situation at the front: ⑴ After our army lost Yuanping on the 11th, we retreated to the new position north of Xinkou and launched a counterattack on the enemy. After fierce battles on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th, approximately 6,000-7,000 enemy soldiers were killed. There were only minor engagements on the 16th, 17th, and 18th. ⑵ Our main force is currently still in a standoff with the enemy north of Honggou, north of Xinkou. The left flank is in a standoff with the enemy north of Dabai Shui. The right flank faces off with the enemy across the Yunzhong River south of Lingshan. The enemy has made no progress. ⑶ The fierceness of this battle at Xinkou is unprecedented since the start of the war on the PingSui Line. Both sides occupy high ground and fire artillery at each other. The artillery fire on the 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th was so intense that there were approximately three rounds per minute on average. ⑷ The commanders at the front in the Battle of Xinkou personally directed and supervised the battle on the front line. Their heroic spirit is deeply admirable. On the evening of the 15th, Hao Mengling, the commander of our 9th Army, along with Division Commander Liu Jiaqi and Brigade Commander Zheng Tingzhen, led the entire army in an attack on the enemy from the left flank. Unfortunately, they were hit by the enemy's heavy artillery on a hillside midway, and heroically sacrificed themselves for the country. ⑸ The actual number of enemy troops near Xinkou is approximately 40,000-50,000, but they have been heavily surrounded in recent days, and with no way out, they are resisting desperately. In order to completely annihilate them, our army has adopted a strangling tactic to prevent the enemy from escaping. ⑹ According to reliable information, the enemy's communications from Nankou to north of Xinkou have been cut off by our army. The enemy is extremely panicked. Large numbers of our fresh troops have arrived at the Xinkou front line in recent days and will launch another fierce attack on the enemy in the coming days. It is expected that the enemy will be annihilated in the near future. The situation of the war is very optimistic. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] According to reports received here from the headquarters of the Japanese army in North China, the climate in Shanxi is now severely cold, with snow reaching the ankles, and the mountainous roads are rugged, making it extremely difficult for the Japanese army to move.

<h3>A Certain Route Army on the Pinghan Railway Flanks and Advances; Enemy Warships on the Jinpu Railway Encircle and Occupy Baoding</h3>
<p>Our Main Force Launches a Swift Counterattack; The Enemy Collapses Eastward Along the Cangshi Road</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] Reliable news: A certain route army of ours flanked from the left and occupied Baoding. The enemy has no way to retreat. Our main force launched a swift counterattack.

<h3>Our Troops on the Jinpu Railway Link Up to Annihilate the Enemy</h3>
<p>Guerrilla Forces Destroy Railroads; The Enemy Cannot Attend to Both Ends</p>
<p>[Jinan] Our powerful right-wing troops have made firm contact with our main force, and will annihilate the enemy in the area south of Pingyuan. The remnants of the enemy on the Jinpu Railway have their railroads destroyed by our guerrilla forces and their flanks attacked, and are unable to attend to both ends, filled with fear.

<h3>Statistics on Our Schools Destroyed by Enemy Aircraft</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] A spokesman from the Ministry of Education told reporters that since the large-scale invasion by the Japanese army, they have bombed our cities and villages, massacred our civilians, women, and children, and have especially wantonly destroyed and harmed schools and students in war zones and non-war zones. According to recent investigations, the following institutions of higher education have been destroyed: Nankai in Tianjin; Hebei Women's Normal College, Hebei Institute of Technology in Hebei; Hebei Medical College, and Agricultural College in Baoding; Tongji, Jinan, Datong, Fudan, Daxia, Shanghai Business College, Law School, Chizhi, Zhengfeng, Southeast Medical College, Tongde Medical College, Music College, Merchant Marine College, and Physical Education College in Shanghai; Central University and Dental School in Nanjing; and Medical College in Nanchang; Zhongshan University in Guangzhou.

The exact number and details of other destroyed primary and secondary schools are still under investigation. There is also much evidence of students and teachers being detained and massacred. These facts are sufficient to prove that the enemy has deliberately targeted schools for bombing.

<h3>Enemy Planes Bomb and Strafe Italian Embassy Military Attache in Suzhou</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th – The Italian Embassy's military attache, Libici, accompanied by Fitinghoff, a German staff member of the Jinling Automobile Company, the son of a German doctor, Hellsberg, and Manager Wei of the International Liaison Society, drove in two cars from Shanghai to Nanjing at six o'clock this morning.

The planes immediately dropped several bombs and strafed the cars with machine guns at low altitude. Fortunately, Libici and others had already taken refuge in the fields and escaped danger. Only the cars they were travelling in were damaged. The enemy planes' arbitrary bombing of non-combatants is further strong evidence of their brutality, and international figures should despise this illegal action by the Japanese even more.</p>

<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull consulted at length today with Davis, the U.S. Chief Delegate to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference. He also repeatedly consulted experts familiar with the situation in the Far East regarding the various aspects of the Sino-Japanese War. It is reported that the experts have submitted all relevant economic materials to Davis for detailed consideration, including the potential economic impact should the war prolong and the Open Door Policy be hindered.

<p>[Washington] The Soviet Russian Ambassador to the U.S., Troyanovsky, has been away for a long time. After returning here tomorrow, he will likely discuss the issue of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference with the State Department. The U.S. has played a leading role in convening this conference, so the Soviet Union may express its intention to participate to Secretary of State Hull. It is understood that Hull also supports inviting the Soviet Union, as the Sino-Japanese War affects the Soviet Union the most, aside from China. In the future, the Soviet Union's various commercial, financial, and transportation interests in China may be endangered, so the Soviet Union is very willing to participate in diplomatic negotiations in Brussels. However, if the Soviet Union is invited, Germany also seems to be entitled to the same treatment. On September 19th, Hull stated that the Sino-Japanese issue is a common problem for the whole world. Therefore, the Brussels conference may expand into a world conference. (18th, Guomin News dispatch)</p>
<p>[New York] The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Troyanovsky, recently returned to the country for a trip and arrived in New York today. He told reporters that he believes that if democratic countries can unite to resist aggressor countries, they will be able to accomplish the task of creating world peace. However, the concern is that each country wants other countries to come forward as leaders. Regarding recent reports that the Soviet Union has moved aircraft and troops to the Far Eastern border, he said that there is only a feeling of opposition to aggression within the Soviet Union. There are airplanes everywhere in the Soviet Union because we believe it is necessary. The Soviet Union is currently very peaceful, but it is prepared to deal with any eventuality. Soviet industry has made significant progress, and agricultural products have also been harvested. Military and national defense have reached an unprecedented level of strength in the Soviet Union. Troyanovsky also stated that if the Soviet Union is invited to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the Soviet Union may send a representative to attend.

Conversely, if the countries accept Japan's view that the cause of the Sino-Japanese War is the anti-Japanese movement and red terror, then Japan will send a delegation to Brussels. However, political figures admit that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference will absolutely not accept Japan's reasons. (19th, Guomin Maritime News dispatch)</p>

<p>⊙Jerusalem Riots continue to occur in various parts of Palestine, so the situation is still very tense. All military points are heavily guarded, and the Abyssinians who have come here to take refuge since May of last year have a plan to go to London as a whole. The government is now making every effort to prevent the riots from escalating. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>[Paris] After fleeing from Palestine, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem has safely arrived in Syria, so the powerful authorities in Paris have discussed this matter but have not made any decision. It is known that after the Palestinian government began arresting Arab leaders, the Grand Mufti fled to the Woma Monastery, stayed for a day or two, and then fled Palestine. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Jerusalem According to news received here, the Grand Mufti is now at the Port of Darabula. He originally intended to request to stay in Damascus for a few weeks, but the French authorities did not allow it. It is understood that the Grand Mufti is preparing to go to Ankara, the capital of Turkey, to appeal to President Kemal for assistance. If there is no result, he will go to Iraq to seek assistance from the British mandate authorities. The British mandate authorities do not attach much importance to the above activities because they believe that the Grand Mufti's escape from Jerusalem has greatly damaged his prestige among his followers. (19th, Guomin Maritime News dispatch)</p>
<p>⊙Jerusalem The Baharia police station was attacked, and a large number of firearms and ammunition were robbed. The local authorities specially fined Baharia 2,000 pounds and designated an equal number of houses to be demolished. If a gun is returned later, one less house will be demolished. A train from Haifa to Egypt discovered a landmine in the middle of the journey, but fortunately it was not detonated. It is also reported that the members of the Arab Higher Committee who fled to Syria and the Arab nationalists in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon have organized a new Arab Higher Committee in that area. (Central News Agency, 19th, Reuters dispatch) [London] The anti-British movement of Arabs in Palestine continues unabated. Although the local military and police have suppressed it, order has not been restored. This is not unrelated to Italy. News carried by British newspapers in recent days says that the Italian government is now using the Addis Ababa radio station in Abyssinia to broadcast news in Arabic to Palestine for propaganda purposes and will build a new radio broadcasting station and Arab University in Harar, Abyssinia, to engage in anti-British agitation. Regarding this matter, political figures here recently commented that there is no doubt that the Italian radio station is broadcasting in Arabic, and we know it well. However, on the whole, the situation in Palestine is still optimistic. (Central News Agency, 19th, Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Anti-Japanese Movement in Labor Circles of Various Countries</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>On the eve of the Brussels conference, labor organizations in various countries, regardless of their original colors, are enthusiastically carrying out an anti-Japanese movement. This is very worthy of attention.</p>
<p>According to a recent statement issued by the Executive Committee of the British Trades Union Congress, the trade unions of the United States, Canada, New Zealand, the Australian Federation, Mexico, India, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Ireland have unanimously expressed their approval of the resolution previously passed by the Executive Committee of the British National Labor Movement condemning Japanese atrocities and advocating a boycott of Japanese goods and have all decided to implement a boycott of Japanese goods. Also noteworthy is that the two major labor organizations in the United States, the Labor Federation and the Industrial Organizations Committee, have historically been at odds and engaged in fierce struggles. Recently, in addition to passing resolutions to condemn aggressor countries, there is also a tendency for joint action for world peace.</p>
<p>The aggressive actions of international gangsters endanger world peace. If the people of various countries do not use effective methods to curb them but allow them to spread, then no corner of the world can avoid war. This is a common feeling among people of all levels in various countries, but the labor class, because it has less direct interest and less to worry about with aggressor countries, is the first to take steps to strike at international gangsters.</p>
<p>The high tide of the anti-Japanese movement in labor circles of various countries obviously has a great effect. It goes without saying that our enemies will therefore suffer a serious blow economically. At least the element of indulgence and accommodation to international gangsters in the diplomatic policies of various governments can now be expected to be reduced somewhat.</p>

<h3>Fundraising for the Wounded and Fallen Soldiers' Pension Fund</h3>
<p>Adapting to a Long-Term War of Resistance</p>
<p>Recently, it was learned that enthusiastic people from all sides have launched a fundraising campaign for 20 million yuan for a pension fund for the wounded and fallen soldiers in order to adapt to a long-term war of resistance. This will be used to assist the government in providing for the families of the deceased, resettling wounded warriors, and running schools for the dependents of fallen soldiers. After the fund is raised, it is planned to use 16 million yuan to purchase national salvation public bonds, and in the future, the principal and interest payments from the public bonds will be allocated to the aforementioned expenses. The remaining 4 million yuan in cash will be used to cover immediate expenses for the next three years.</p>

In order to cope with the needs of large households, the postal bureau yesterday requested 50,000 yuan worth of 100-yuan bonds from the General Association for Solicitation to be prepared for use. It is believed that there is no shortage of patriots in the city, so this small amount of 50,000 yuan, through the hard work of postmen in soliciting, is expected to be able to apply for the fourth batch soon.</p>

<h3>Siblings Save on Food and Clothing to Comfort Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association received 100 yuan in national currency from Shen Maolan and her four siblings from Cangqian Mountain in Fuzhou, who identified themselves as "little citizens." They specified that the money be used to comfort the brave and loyal soldiers fighting in the war. The original letter stated: "Since the start of the full-scale war of resistance, the soldiers defending the country at the front have bravely fought the enemy, breaking limbs and bones, and making heroic sacrifices. We five siblings, although underage, cannot help but feel grief and indignation whenever our family members talk about the various situations of the wounded soldiers. Therefore, we have decided that we will not buy new clothes or eat fruits and pastries this year, and we have obtained the consent of our parents to allow us to pre-spend 20 yuan per person from the saved funds to comfort our brave and loyal wounded soldiers fighting in the war. A drop in the bucket, but we are doing our best. We are sending 100 yuan in national currency, please check and forward it to the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association. Sincerely, Shen Maolan, Maofang, Maofu, Maoqing, No. 4 Heling Road, Cangqian Mountain, Fuzhou." The association issued a receipt and replied with a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>Huang Yanpei Has Returned South After Completing慰問 Activities in the North</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Anti-Enemy Support Association recently sent Huang Yanpei to the north to express慰問. After being dispatched, Mr. Huang went to the front line in North China to send letters of慰問 to the soldiers fighting there. This reporter learned from the Local Association that Mr. Huang has recently returned south to Beijing and is expected to return to Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<h3>British Scouts Express Deep Sympathy to Us</h3>
<p>Telegram Reply to the City Scout Service Corps</p>
<p>The brutal Japanese invasion of Shanghai and our army's vow to fight to the death have won considerable international sympathy. Boy and Girl Scouts in this city have risen up to serve, engaging in relief and rescue work in the front and rear. They also sent a telegram to the World Scout Movement on Double Tenth Day, reporting the enemy's atrocities and the Scouts' service situation, hoping to arouse a sense of justice among people around the world. They received a telegram from the British Boy Scouts Association: "The British Consulate in Shanghai forwards to the Shanghai Chinese Boy Scouts Wartime Service Corps. We have received your telegram. We deeply sympathize with and pay tribute to the Chinese Boy Scout brothers who are not afraid of difficulties and are engaged in relief work at this critical time. The details of your work will be published in prominent positions in British newspapers. We hope you will continue your efforts. More details in the letter. Sincerely, the British Boy Scouts Association, London, October 17th."</p>

<h3>National Labor Council Implements Effective Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Reply to Zhu Xuefan's Telegram</p>
<p>Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions and candidate for the International Labour Bureau Council, recently telegraphed the International Labour Bureau Council in Geneva and the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions, requesting the implementation of economic sanctions against Japan to curb Japanese atrocities and maintain peace in East Asia. Mr. Quan received a reply telegram yesterday, stating that effective methods have been adopted to implement sanctions. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>International Labour Bureau Council's Reply Telegram</p>
<p>We have received and understood your telegram. We have long been aware of Japan's aggressive invasion of China. We have now telegraphed the 51 national federations of trade unions under the leadership of the International Federation of Trade Unions to fulfill their obligations, stop Japan's illegal activities in the Far East, and do their best to assist the League of Nations in taking the most effective measures to curb further inhumane acts by the violent Japanese in China. Respectfully,</p>
<p>Dutch Federation of Trade Unions' Reply Telegram</p>

The Social Democratic Party and the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions have complied with the wishes in your telegram and passed the following resolution: "The Social Democratic Party and the Dutch Federation of Trade Unions have decided to implement economic sanctions against Japan in accordance with your request to defeat the inhumane aggressor nation that is indiscriminately bombing your country."</p>
<h3>Insulting Newspaper's Dishonorable Character Demands Punishment</h3>
<p>Named "New Shenbao" but the Content is Base and Sordid – Fabricated Absurd News is Not Worth a Laugh</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Continental Daily News reported that some Japanese reporters in this city who had studied Chinese during their school days are now devoting themselves to editing a Chinese newspaper named "New Shenbao." The reason for using this name is to imitate the oldest and most widely sold "Shenbao" in China. Although the text tries to take a Chinese stand, the lines are full of forced tones written by Japanese people. The most conspicuous thing is that its distribution office is located at No. 455 Zhapu Road, Hongkou, telephone number 4867. In other words, the newspaper is printed by the Japanese "Shanghai Daily News" newspaper office, and the editor is probably a member of that newspaper office. The cover states that it is published daily and sells for three cents. However, Shanghai newspaper stands do not sell this newspaper, so it is only mailed to some Chinese shops and individuals. The news column contains various fabricated news. (The translator notes that the Japanese are extremely rogue and repeatedly make shameless moves. They have not only scattered dog-shit-incomprehensible Chinese leaflets in buildings, but also compiled and printed this kind of Chinese newspaper full of nonsense, using base and sordid actions to incite our compatriots and end the war as soon as possible. This is enough to reflect their predicament. It should be known that today our compatriots are united in spirit and share the same hatred of the enemy. Nothing can shake them. Hearing this rabid barking will only strengthen their determination. If the enemy were in a position to win, they could safely wait for the victory on the battlefield and would never engage in such ugly behavior to be laughed at by the world. However, since it is mailed to various places, it is hoped that the postal authorities will pay attention to it.)</p>
<h3>Contributing Wartime Opinions, Pay Attention to Three Points</h3>
<p>Wartime Opinion Collection Office Hopes That All Suggestion Makers Will Comply</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Design Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association, a Public Opinion Collection Office has been set up to gather opinions from all sources. The temporary communication address is Room 508, Zhonghui Building, Edward Road. Dozens of opinions are received daily. According to the person in charge of the office, the association has received more than 490 suggestions from various parties, all of which have been approved and adopted. However, please pay attention to the following three points in the future: ㊀ The suggestion makers often do not want to state their names and addresses, so that the association cannot reply to the results. ㊁ When suggestion personnel offer opinions, they hope to talk less about theory and focus more on facts, so that each problem has concrete solutions listed. ㊂ The association has always replied to the suggestion makers' letters after receiving them, and then reviewed and forwarded them to the relevant parties for reference. However, whether they are adopted and processed, the association will inform the suggestion makers after receiving a reply from the relevant agencies. Please do not come to the association to inquire. In addition, the association has set up a special talent registration office in response to wartime needs. The temporary registration location is No. 20 Xifuyuan Lane, Jiaozhou Road, Roberts Road. Anyone with special skills who has not registered with various agencies and groups in this city can go to the registration location to collect a form and register.</p>
<h3>Admiral Little Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday on His Flagship</h3>
<p>British Far East Naval Commander Admiral Little has completed his inspection of South China and returned north from Hong Kong on his flagship HMS Kent. It was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai the day before yesterday, but it was delayed en route and only entered the port yesterday morning. At about 8 o'clock, he disembarked at the Xin Guan Wharf by launch and returned to his residence for rest.</p>
<h3>American Transport Ship Carries American僑 Away from Shanghai</h3>
<p>The American transport ship Chaumont arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines a few days ago. The ship is scheduled to carry 60 American僑 away from Shanghai tomorrow (the 20th), passing through Qingdao and Yantai to Kobe, and then transferring to a Dollar Company ship to return to the United States.</p>
<h3>North China Youth Tragically Captured and Killed by Enemy Troops</h3>
<p>Yanjing University Students Also Arrested, Fate Unknown</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Shanghai-Tianjin Alumni Association, the pressure exerted by the Japanese on students trapped in the Tianjin area has intensified in recent times. All middle schools have been forced to start classes and receive indoctrination. It is recently heard that Tsinghua and Peking Universities will also start classes, and a large number of students will be transferred from the puppet state of Manchuria to Tianjin. On the other hand, students from various schools are arrested and go missing almost every day. Recently, Yanjing University was also searched, and 28 students were arrested in one swoop. Their fate is still unknown. The school's president, American Stuart Leighton, has negotiated with the Japanese embassy, but to no avail. (Japanese officials told Stuart that under the sun flag, the Japanese military authorities have the right to dispose of people of any country, especially since the Yanjing students are Chinese. Their tyranny is such.) Yanjing, which is generally considered a relatively safe place, is like this, so one can imagine what it is like elsewhere. The people in Beijing are now panicked, and students risk dressing up and going south, one after another. Shipping between Tianjin and Shanghai is intermittent. Recently, a large number of students have come to Shanghai, and we are afraid that they will not be well received. We are publicly soliciting again, hoping that students who come to Shanghai will register with the association to connect with each other and jointly engage in national salvation work. The association is scheduled to hold its second general assembly at 2 pm on the 24th to intensify its work.</p>
<h3>Military Commission Commends Cilian Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Disaster Relief Association established the War Zone Refugee Relief Committee immediately after the outbreak of the Shanghai war and handled the reception and repatriation of refugees with extraordinary efforts. Until recently, there were still more than 30,000 refugees in the various shelters. The association submitted a report on its work to the Military Commission a few days ago and received a reply from the Military Commission yesterday commending it. The letter stated: "We have forwarded your association's letter and attached report of this year's upper month 4th to the committee. Your association's relief efforts for wounded soldiers and victims are well-planned and effective, and have greatly benefited the country. We deeply admire you. Sincerely, Military Commission."</p>
<h3>American Women's Community筹办 Children's Hospital</h3>
<p>Specializing in Adopting Sick Children from Various Shelters After the Weather Cools, Many Refugees in Various Refugee Shelters in This City Suffer from Diseases, Especially Children Aged One to Three, Because There is Little Milk and No Way to Take Care of Them. According to a Recent Survey by Charity Organizations, Statistics from Various Shelters in Recent Days Show That More Than 200 Children Die Every Day Due to Illness. This is Only One Aspect of the Lack of Nutrition Among Children. The American Women's Community in Shanghai Recently Held a Meeting to Discuss筹办 a Children's Hospital Dedicated to Adopting Children From the Time They Are Born Until They Are One Year Old for Relief. Everyone Was Impressed by the American Women's Community's Enthusiastic Relief Efforts. The Health Bureau is Also筹设 a Similar Hospital Dedicated to Adopting Children From One to Five Years Old. Children Over the Age Will Not Be Adopted. This is Truly Good News for Refugee Children. However, Because Funds Are Needed Everywhere, It is Hoped That All Sectors Will Find Ways to Donate.</p>
<h3>Coming and Going in Bombing Raids</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>XI</p>
<p>I accepted ×××’s dinner invitation for the evening, with Chunru as a fellow diner.</p>
<p>Although ×× and I had only met twice, we were already like old friends of many years. We spoke frankly about everything and did not feel the need for any polite formalities. His physique was very robust. At first, I thought he was a purely exemplary soldier, but his interest in literature was extraordinarily deep. During this second meeting, he spoke of Yu Dafu, Mao Dun, and even Yun Daiying. He said that Daiying was not only good at giving speeches but also at writing articles. It was a pity that he died early, otherwise he would be active again now.</p>
<p>The conversation turned to the enemy’s bombing of Nanjing. The enemy had declared long ago that there would be a large-scale bombing of Nanjing after noon on the 21st, and asked diplomatic personnel and residents of all countries to withdraw. This clumsy and violent declaration revealed the Japanese’s “bully the weak, fear the strong” attitude of currying favor with superiors. The Chinese are easy to mess with, and it doesn’t matter if tens or hundreds of thousands are killed. But foreigners are not to be trifled with. The Japanese are dwarves in front of foreigners, and they are fearsome giants in front of the Chinese. This is their “Bushido.” Bullshit.</p>
<p>—However, we welcome the enemy’s planes coming to attack the rear, because that can reduce the suffering of our soldiers at the front and increase our hatred of the enemy in the full-scale war of resistance. This was the opinion expressed by ××, and these words deeply moved me.</p>
<p>The victory at Pingxingguan was also reported by ××. I had heard people talking about this news early in the afternoon, but everyone was still skeptical. This time it was confirmed. However, the details of the battle and the participating troops had not yet been clearly reported.</p>
<p>After dinner, I said to Chunru: I plan to return to Shanghai in a day or two, because there is some important work that I must take care of.</p>
<p>Chunru said: Cars are convenient and can be set off at any time. He also said that he also wanted to go to the front to visit his family and had already telegraphed the front for instructions. He would probably get a reply tomorrow.</p>
<p>So we agreed to leave Nanjing at about three or four o'clock tomorrow afternoon, if all the circumstances permitted.</p>
<p>Having decided to rush back to Shanghai, it was necessary to report to Mr. Chiang first. After leaving ××’s branch office, I went to visit Zhang Yuejun again and asked him to convey my message to Mr. Chiang. At the same time, I also told him about Mr. Chiang’s conversation with me and reiterated my personal wish not to accept the title.</p>
<p>Yuejun replied that he would convey everything for me. He asked me: Do you still want to see Mr. Wang?</p>
<p>I said: I am very willing, as long as Mr. Wang has a convenient time.</p>
<p>Yuejun immediately called Mr. Wang and arranged to meet him at a certain place at nine o’clock tomorrow morning. At the same time, he inquired in detail about the news of the victory at Pingxingguan that I had told him.</p>
<p>The victory was indeed large-scale, killing 3,000 enemies, capturing 2,000, and seizing countless enemy military supplies. The participating troops were the Eighth Route Army. The battle was fought by first using a battalion of men to harass the enemy's rear, luring them to a mountain valley where there was an ambush, and annihilating them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Truly delightful. If this were ten years ago, upon hearing such news, I would have downed a large bottle of brandy.</p>
<h3>American僑 Affected by the Shanghai War Suffer Losses of Four Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Tobacco Leaf, Oil, and Paper Merchants Suffer the Most – Dollar Company's Losses Are Also Significant</p>
<p>During the Shanghai war, the losses of American僑 in this city, as of now, have been reported to the American consulate by ten companies. The losses suffered by tobacco leaf merchants, oil merchants, and paper merchants are the largest, with a total estimated at at least four million yuan. As for indirect losses, since Dollar Company stopped its Shanghai route, American imports have almost disappeared, and exports such as tung oil, which is the raw material most welcomed by the United States, cannot be transported either. The losses in the past two months have been enormous and difficult to calculate for the time being.</p>
<h3>Yarn Factory Workers' National Salvation Association Sends Female Workers to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>It is Learned That the Shanghai Yarn Factory Workers' National Salvation Association Has Reached an Agreement With a Certain Factory in Suzhou to Send 500 Female Workers to Work. The Travel Expenses of the Workers Sent to Work Are Borne by the Relief Association. If the Workers' Family Members Want to Return, Their Travel Expenses Are Also Borne by the Relief Association. It is Also Learned That the Association Plans to Send People to Suzhou Immediately to Discuss All Issues Concerning the Workers' Treatment. All Yarn Factory Workers Should Register With the Association at No. 24 Fuxing Village, Jiaozhou Road Immediately.</p>
<h3>First Aider Song Shujun Dies From Overwork</h3>
<p>Song Shujun, a member of the Eighth First Aid Team of the Shanghai First Aid Committee, worked day and night at the front line to rescue wounded soldiers in the hail of bullets, without fear of danger, and rarely rested. He finally fell ill from overwork and died on the morning of the 18th of this month. It is said that his funeral was quite desolate.</p>
<h3>Service Groups Seeking Members</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Patriotic National Salvation Propaganda Group, organized by a group of enthusiastic young people, has been established for more than a month. Its work is to sing and perform at wounded soldier hospitals. The work has been intense in recent days. Now, because the original members are insufficient, it is specially publicly recruiting male and female members. Anyone who is slightly interested in drama and singing can register at No. 59 Peide Lane, Datong Road, from the 20th to the 25th of this month. The Hongkou Track and Field Team, in order to summon members to participate in wartime service, will process registrations from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm every day from today until the 22nd at Zheng Zhichao's place, No. 91 Mingde Lane, Fuxu Road, in order to allocate work.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Announcing Japan's Breach of Treaty and Aggression Against China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhirang</p>
<p>Our nation submitted a petition to the League of Nations on September 12th. On the 15th of the same month, Chief Delegate Gu Weijun declared to the General Assembly of the League of Nations, hoping to announce Japan as an aggressor nation. Although the League of Nations has not yet made such an announcement, in the General Assembly on the 6th of this month, when it passed the resolution to convene the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, it also passed a factual report which clearly pointed out that: Japan's military actions against China with its army, navy, and air force cannot be justified as necessary self-defense. Furthermore, there is no basis to verify the claim of self-defense. Therefore, these actions are in fact violations of the obligations it bears under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The British Foreign Office also issued a statement on the same day, stating that Japan's actions in China are inconsistent with the principles of international relations and violate the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The conclusion reached by the US government is the same as that of the League of Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p>What difference is there between such a determination and determining Japan to be an aggressor nation? An aggressor nation or a war of aggression is merely a concept. Regardless of what definition it should adopt, conducting military actions against another country illegally will inevitably be included within the scope of this concept. It's like determining that a person has indeed illegally caused another person's death, and directly calling him a murderer. Aside from the different wording, there is no difference. Therefore, the League of Nations and the United States' determination of the aforementioned facts is tantamount to announcing Japan as an aggressor nation - when the question of whether Japan is an aggressor nation must be answered, they can have no other answer unless they overturn their previous statements.</p>
<p>Such a determination by the League of Nations and the United States has a tremendous impact - it determines the legal, political, and moral standing of the member states of the League of Nations and the United States regarding the Sino-Japanese War, points out the path that the Nine-Power Treaty Conference should take, and suggests the matters that our country should implement at present.</p>
<p>Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates: Member states of the League of Nations undertake to respect and preserve against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. Article 11 stipulates: Any war is considered an event of concern to the entire League, and the League should take appropriate and effective actions to safeguard international peace. Article 16 stipulates: Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under the provisions regarding arbitration, judicial settlement or enquiry, such action shall ipso facto be deemed to be an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not. Article 17 stipulates the procedures that should be followed when the above provisions apply to non-member states. These are the obligations borne by member states of the League of Nations when a war occurs - they should implement economic and military sanctions against the aggressor nation, and mutually assist each other under certain conditions. The United States, although not a member of the League of Nations, is a signatory to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. This pact formally declares the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy in their relations with one another, and stipulates that the settlement or solution of all disputes or conflicts of whatever nature or of whatever origin they may be, which may arise among them, shall never be sought except by pacific means. Under this pact, Japan bears the obligation not to engage in war towards other signatory countries, including the United States.</p>
<p>Now Japan is engaged in war against China. Whether it has a reason or not, it is violating the obligation not to engage in war for signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and it has triggered the reasons for imposing sanctions for member states of the League of Nations. This is based solely on the Sino-Japanese War itself. If we further discuss the situation created by its past military actions, then it has also violated, in particular, the obligation of respecting the territorial and administrative integrity of China for the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty. Under such circumstances, the member states of the League of Nations and the countries that signed the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty - especially those that participated in the Brussels Conference - bear certain responsibilities in law and morality.</p>
<p>From a passive perspective, they can no longer have the possibility of declaring neutrality regarding China's resistance, no matter what happens in the future - the American Neutrality Act has no reason to be implemented. This is because member states of the League of Nations already have the obligation to impose sanctions against Japan, and signatory countries of the Kellogg-Briand Pact have already discovered that Japan is engaging in the behaviors that the pact rejects. Strict adherence to neutrality is a method of treating the perpetrator and the victim equally, so it is not only morally unacceptable but also prohibited by the aforementioned covenant and pact. Not only that, the resolution passed by the League of Nations General Assembly on the 6th of this month has already stated clearly that the General Assembly expresses spiritual assistance to China, and suggests to all member states to refrain from all behaviors that would weaken China's resistance and consider the extent to which each country can individually assist China. US President Roosevelt also stated in his speech on the 5th of this month that countries infected with the epidemic of disregarding the law should be forcibly quarantined. The State Department also invoked President Roosevelt's speech the next day, advocating that international treaties must be respected. Therefore, it is very obvious that they no longer have the possibility of maintaining neutrality.</p>
<p>From a proactive perspective, we can - and should immediately - advocate to the countries participating in the Nine-Power Treaty Conference that they impose economic, military, and other sanctions against Japan. Although the United States is not bound by the League of Nations Covenant, it also has the responsibility to use effective methods to forcibly eliminate the behaviors rejected by the pact, and military sanctions are the most effective of these methods.</p>
<p>Even if we take a step back and do not propose military sanctions as the first step, we should at least advocate that all countries immediately sever economic and diplomatic relations with Japan. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also issued a statement on the 6th of this month explaining President Roosevelt's method of forced quarantine, also advocated that countries around the world should reject Japan and refuse to interact with it, which is what I am stating here.</p>
<p>It seems that no one can deny that our country should present the above claims to the countries concerned. So, before making this proposition, what should our country do? If we ask others to take one step, we should at least take three steps ourselves. We cannot fail to first sever our own economic relations with Japan while advocating to others to implement economic sanctions; similarly, we cannot fail to first sever our own diplomatic relations with Japan while advocating to others to sever diplomatic relations with Japan. Therefore, before the Brussels Conference is convened, our country should quickly implement the following actions against Japan: ㊀ Recall all personnel of the embassy in Japan and all consuls; ㊁ Announce the invalidation and suspension of treaties and stop paying the principal and interest on foreign debts; ㊂ Confiscate public property of enemy countries in China and refer to the precedent before World War I and the examples during World War I to stipulate measures for handling private property of enemy country nationals in China; ㊃ Refer to precedents before and during the Great War to stipulate how to deal with enemy country nationals in China; ㊄ Prohibit trade with the enemy and sever all economic relations. This will externally demonstrate our country's long-held determination to burn our boats, which we have already had subjectively. Finally, our country should also declare as early as possible: Our country participates in this conference convened because Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, with a belief - this belief is that countries will never violate the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty regarding respecting our country's territorial integrity and the principles of justice and fairness, and propose methods of mediation.</p>

<h3>The Enemy's Attempt to Invade Dachang Fails - Our Elite Troops Are Triply Flanking</h3>
<p>The Enemy's Four Fierce Attacks on Sujiazhai Were All Repelled - The Enemy in the Huanggang and Hulizhai Areas Were Besieged by Us - We Still Hold the Yujiazhai and Chenjiazhai Positions</p>
<p>This newspaper received the following front-line war report this afternoon. From last night to 10 AM this morning, the focus of the battle north of Dachang was still on the two lines on the left and right of Yujiazhai on the Shanghai-Tai Road, especially the area from Gejiapailouzhai to Sujiazhai west of the highway. The enemy's purpose was to charge directly at the front of Dachang along the highway with tanks, and to attack Xiaochiyuan and Sujiazhai with the main force, attempting to break through the highway between Dachang and Nanxiang and compress the rear of our army. Therefore, after the enemy troops broke into Gejiapailouzhai, they again, starting from dusk yesterday, gathered a large number of strong and stubborn infantry, and under the intense fire of their artillery, launched a fierce attack on our Sujiazhai and Xiaochiyuan positions from the Huanggang area, aggressively advancing in a wedge-shaped formation. Our army believed that this road was related to the gain or loss of Dachang, so it dispatched elite troops to encircle the enemy on both the left and right wings, and jointly attacked with the front of Sujiazhai. An unprecedented bloody battle immediately began. Up to 8 AM this morning, the enemy troops charged four times, and our army fought on three sides, advancing wave upon wave, with no retreat. Therefore, the enemy troops repeatedly charged fiercely, but were all severely attacked, and retreated with more than half of their casualties. Our side also suffered considerable losses. The enemy finally retreated to the Huanggang and Hulizhai areas after suffering heavy casualties at 8 AM this morning, and was surrounded by us on three sides. Because the enemy knew that our side would inevitably counterattack on this line, and was stationed with heavy troops, it hurriedly built fortifications near Gejiapailouzhai. Also, the enemy in the Huangjiazhai area on the front of the highway yesterday used 30 tanks to cover the large team of enemy soldiers, divided towards the southeast Sujialinzhai and Yujiazhai our army positions, and violently attacked, and there were many enemy aircraft bombing. At that time, our rear reinforcements could not catch up due to the enemy's excessive fire density, resulting in a breakthrough in a part of the position. After dusk, our army began to counterattack in separate ways, fighting bloodily all night. Three of the enemy's tanks were destroyed by our mortars, and they collapsed and retreated north of Huangjiazhai before dawn this morning. From dawn to 10 AM, the enemy did not dare to attack, and our army still firmly defended the front line north of Yujiazhai and Chenjiazhai along the Shanghai-Tai Road. Chenjiaxiang is still in the hands of our army, and the previously breached position has also been restored. The northern part of the area from Dunwu Temple to Caijiatang has also been retaken. Last night and this morning, the enemy continued to send small troops to disturb and contain our army, but our side was stationed with elite troops, and the enemy's attempt would never succeed. The enemy on the front of Guangfu Town did not attack yesterday or today. However, the enemy artillery team in the Liuhang area occasionally bombarded our side, and our army remained unmoved. Our army west of Luodian still firmly defended its original position, and there was no change. There was a small conflict northeast of Miaohang last night. The enemy artillery fired once every two to three hours, but when their small number of infantry came to attack, they immediately retreated once our army launched an attack. On the Jiangwan to Zhabei line, both sides took a defensive posture, and there was no fierce battle yesterday or today.</p>
<p>On the line west of the Shanghai-Tai Road on the south bank of the Yunzaobang, between Huanggang and Sujiazhai, our enemy and our side have now launched a major battle. The situation of this battle has the possibility of completely breaking the enemy's attempt to attack Dachang. Our forces are strong and our positions are solid near Dachang, and there is absolutely no need to worry about Dachang. At the same time, some people are worried that the situation in Dachang is tense, fearing that the Zhabei to Jiangwan line on the right wing will also be withdrawn. According to our military authorities, this is absolutely irrelevant. Even if Dachang cannot be defended, Zhabei will also maintain the current situation, firmly defend and resist, and never give up. In fact, the enemy's attack on Dachang is only a dream.</p>
<h3>The Enemy at Gejiapailou is Surrounded and Attacked by Our Forces</h3>
<p>We Assault the Enemy's Left Flank from Maqiao, Causing Instability in the Enemy's Rear</p>
<p>Since the battle at Gejiapailou Mansion, after suffering heavy losses from our forces, the enemy has been urgently reinforcing, hoping to fight to the death. However, our large army is concentrated on that line, fearing nothing. Fierce battles have unfolded in recent days. The density of artillery fire and the intensity of hand-to-hand combat have been unprecedented. The enemy has suffered extremely heavy losses, with corpses lying everywhere and blood splattering the fields. Although our army has suffered considerable sacrifices, our positions are consolidated and have not been taken by the enemy. Therefore, the enemy is at a loss. Fearing the danger of being deeply isolated, they shifted troops to the east, attempting to sneak attack our Jixiangzhai area to reverse their isolation. Unexpectedly, they were again severely attacked by our forces. Currently, with the help of reinforcements from their rear, the enemy hopes to come back with renewed ferocity and probe towards the Jixiangzhai and Gejiapailou areas. At times, the enemy's air force also comes out to assist in the battle. Our army, fully aware of their plans, in addition to directly and fiercely suppressing them from the front, has dispatched heavy forces from the Maqiao and Yujiazhai areas to attack the enemy's left flank, successfully surrounding and outflanking the enemy's rear advancing towards Gejiapailou. Therefore, the enemy's rear in the Gejiapailou area has been destabilized. At the same time, our heavy forces on the Huli Village and Zhangjialou lines are also responding with a pincer attack. Consequently, the enemy's main force is now surrounded by our forces.</p>
<p>A correspondent from the Central News Agency with the army in Jiangwan reported at 12:40 PM on the 20th: Since the fighting on the south bank of the Wenzaobang shifted to the highway line, the enemy has been using tanks to rush south from Tangqiao. Fierce fighting occurred all day at Maqiao Village, where they suffered a strong blow from our forces. After having three tanks destroyed by us, realizing they could not succeed, they immediately retreated. At night, the fighting at Shengjiazhai and Huli Village became even more intense. The enemy attacked west from Huanggang and Gejiapailou, but also encountered severe resistance. Our army firmly defended its original positions, never yielding slightly despite being under artillery fire and a rain of bullets. On the eastern end of the highway, along the bank at Shenjiawan, Luzhai, and Gaorenqiaozhai, the enemy's fierce attacks failed. Therefore, starting last night, they again bombarded heavily with artillery for a long time, and their troops made several attempts to attack. However, each time we met them with a head-on assault, driving them back. Our current defense line on the south bank is exceptionally solid. From Shenjiawan, Luzhai, Gaorenqiaozhai, and Sujiaqiao Village east of the highway, extending west across the highway to Jixiangzhai, Chenjiazhai, Yujiazhai, and as far as Huli Village and Shengjiazhai, all important strongholds are closely connected, as solid as a rock and as secure as a fortress. Fresh troops are also positioned and ready, and have begun a counter-attack. Starting this morning, the sound of artillery has gradually moved further north.</p>
<h3>A Large Batch of Enemy Reinforcements to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Aiming to Seize the Area within the Former Shanghai Demilitarized Zone Before the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</p>
<p>In order to divert international attention and restore national prestige, the Japanese side intends to conquer the non-garrison area within the former Shanghai Demilitarized Zone before the opening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference on the 30th of this month. Therefore, they have additionally transferred more than three divisions of troops from the Ministry of the Army, approximately 50,000 soldiers, to Shanghai to participate in the war. It is reported that this batch of reinforcements will arrive in Shanghai on the 26th.</p>
<p>The enemy, Hasegawa, convened a meeting at the Japanese Club on Hongkou Pong Road on the morning of the 17th, attended by more than 20 people, including Harada, Okawa, Uchio, Tamatsu, and military commanders. The content of their discussion included: ⑴ the concentration points for military forces in this campaign; ⑵ defense strategies against our army's air raids; ⑶ the need to actively occupy Dachang and other plans.</p>
<p>Shimizu, the secretary of the Japanese Embassy in China, left Shanghai and returned to Japan on the 13th of this month. Before his departure, he contacted the consuls of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France before proceeding. It is rumored that Shimizu's mission in returning to Japan is largely related to the establishment of a neutral zone in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Enemy Warships Again Shell Pudong</h3>
<p>Covering Enemy Vessels Stealing Fuel</p>
<p>An enemy warship anchored at buoy number nine suddenly opened fire on our Pudong at around 8:00 AM this morning (the 20th), bombarding it heavily. At the same time, three other small enemy vessels slowly approached the New Mitsui Wharf in Pudong, attempting to land and steal fuel from the coal depot there. Our defending troops, aware of their trickery, ignored the enemy warships' shelling and waited quietly for the small enemy vessels to get close to the shore. Then, they unleashed a concentrated barrage of machine gun fire. Seeing that we were prepared, the enemy troops scurried away in panic, but more than a dozen of them were shot and killed or wounded.</p>
<h3>Further Report on the Downing of an Enemy Plane in Nanxiang</h3>
<p>Crashed at Yangliu Bridge, Both Plane and Crew Burned</p>
<p>The downing of an enemy plane by our forces in Nanxiang was reported in this newspaper this morning, but the detailed situation was unclear. Now, according to a telegram from the Central News Agency in Suzhou on the 19th, we have learned the exact location of the crash. Details are listed below: At 4:30 PM on the 19th, six enemy light bombers flew to the Nanxiang Malu Town area, wreaking havoc. One of them was shot down by our anti-aircraft artillery and crashed at Yangliu Bridge, both the plane and its crew burned. One machine gun was recovered. Three other planes were damaged by our anti-aircraft artillery, and the remaining planes, seeing the situation was unfavorable, fled eastward in panic.</p>
<h3>Enemy Supplies Concentrated in Hongkou</h3>
<p>The Hongan-ji Temple on Zha Pu Road Stores Large Quantities of Munitions and Artillery Positions. A High Tower Built Inside a Girls' School on Shigaota Road Serves as the Hongkou Headquarters.</p>
<p>According to reliable information, the Hongan-ji Temple on Zha Pu Road in Hongkou (a Japanese Buddhist temple) is one of the enemy's important military institutions. There is an underground tunnel beneath the main hall of the temple, storing large quantities of munitions. 300 artillery soldiers are stationed there, with two heavy artillery positions. Two anti-aircraft guns and two anti-aircraft machine guns are installed on the roof. Furthermore, artillery positions are also established at the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company on Xihua Road.</p>
<p>In the area of Pingliang Road in Eastern Shanghai, from Huaxing Road to the end of Pingliang Road, the enemy has planted many landmines at various small intersections along the boundary of the Chinese-administered area.</p>
<p>The Japanese Girls' Elementary School on Shigaota Road in Hongkou has been used as the enemy's Hongkou District Headquarters since the 11th of this month. Recently, the enemy troops transported a large number of bamboo ladders and wooden planks made into wooden rafts, piling them up on Jungong Road and at the golf course near the riverbank for potential use in landings.</p>
<h3>Bombing of Zhabei Does Not Damage Fortifications</h3>
<p>The Top Floor of the Railway Administration Building is Hit and Partially Burned</p>
<p>The Zhabei defense line on our army's right flank is fortified like a golden city. Although the enemy has repeatedly attacked, they have suffered heavy casualties. On the contrary, we have rushed to the intersection of North Sichuan Road, controlling the enemy's ability to move freely in the North Sichuan Road area. Knowing that the various lines in Zhabei are impregnable, the enemy has adopted a bombing policy. In recent days, enemy planes have been flying over the Zhabei area to bomb. Yesterday, several squadrons of enemy planes flew back and forth to the northwest of Baoshan Road, dropping heavy bombs. The North Station and the Railway Administration Building were their main targets. Streams of bombs were dropped on the building, and several hits were scored. The highest floor caught fire, and the stored luggage ticket stubs flew into the sky. The fire spread until the evening, when it was extinguished. Upon investigation, it was found that the building was constructed entirely of reinforced concrete, so although the fire burned all day, only a portion of the stored goods in the northeastern part of the top floor was destroyed. The other floors were not affected. Moreover, our army had long anticipated that the enemy would repeat the tactics of the January 28th Incident and bomb Zhabei. Therefore, the fortifications and related military equipment were arranged carefully and secretly. Even if Zhabei were bombed into a flat ground, it would not hinder our military defense. Therefore, although enemy planes have been bombing continuously for days, only civilian houses have been destroyed. Our military facilities have suffered no damage whatsoever. This morning, enemy planes were again active, but they were not dropping as many bombs as in the past few days. Therefore, apart from the bombing by Japanese planes, the front-line fighting has been very quiet, with only occasional guard gunshots.</p>
<h3>Kawagoe Meets with Hasegawa This Morning</h3>
<p>At around 7:30 AM this morning, Kawagoe Shigeru, accompanied by Counselor Shimizu, traveled by car from his residence on Bi Xun Road to Hongkou to meet with enemy military commanders Hasegawa, Matsui, and Masaki, to hear reports on the front-line battles and discuss diplomatic issues. It was not until 8:50 AM that he returned to his residence in the French Concession via the Waibaidu Bridge in the same car.</p>
<h3>Yoshiko Kawashima Active in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The enemy's Kwantung Army recently dispatched international spy Yoshiko Kawashima and several Chinese and Japanese women to Shanghai to engage in activities. It is now learned that they have established an intelligence agency somewhere to probe into Soviet intelligence. The person in charge there is Vonsiatsky, an important member of the White Russian fascists, who has several White Russians working under him and operating in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Enemy Military Hospitals are Full</h3>
<p>A General Indication of the Intensity of the Fighting</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, the enemy army has established eleven military hospitals in the Hongkou area. Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road has not been used for military purposes and has now been closed. In the last two days, all eleven hospitals have been full, and doctors have been overwhelmed with patients. Therefore, many wounded soldiers have been transported back to Japan by ship in the past two days, which proves the general intensity of the recent fighting.</p>
<h3>The Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses in Eastern Shanxi; Our Army Recaptures Xinjiu Pass</h3>
<p>Situation on the Pinghan Railway Improves; Shijiazhuang and Zhengding Recaptured. On the Jinpu Railway Front, Our Army Crosses Pingyuan and Advances Northward.</p>
<p>[Jizhou] An enemy regiment recently attacked the Old Pass south of Niangziguan and was met with a head-on assault by our forces, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. We immediately recaptured Xinjiu Pass and are advancing rapidly. (Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>[Zhengzhou] The fighting on the Pinghan Railway has been very intense in recent days.

<p>[New York] After President Roosevelt had a long talk with Davis, the chief American representative to the Nine-Power Treaty Conference in Beijing, today, he declared that the US's participation in the Nine-Power Conference does not entail any responsibility on the part of the government to other governments. This is viewed as a response to Republican Senator Johnson, who said in a speech in San Francisco today that Davis would not depart for Beijing until Britain and the US had agreed on the procedures in advance. President Roosevelt also said that the purpose of the meeting is for all countries to agree on finding a way to resolve the current situation in China. Our efforts in this matter are aimed at cooperating with the other signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, including China and Japan. The US delegation is scheduled to depart for Beijing on the "Washington" steamship on Wednesday. (Reuters dispatch, Central News Agency, 19th)</p>

<h3>Enemy Planes Continue to Wreak Havoc</h3>
<p>Civilian Houses at the Haichang Road Intersection in Zhabei Catch Fire; Hongqiao Town is Ravaged Again This Morning</p>
<p>Zhabei</p>
<p>From 10:15 AM to 10:45 AM on the 20th, three enemy bombers were in the sky over Xinmin Road and Datong Road in Zhabei, dropping bombs in stages, for a total of twelve heavy bombs. The first three bombs dropped, one landed next to the former site of the Xinzha Police Station, destroying several civilian houses; one landed near the fire brigade on Xinmin Road, section one, destroying a corner of the fire brigade's lookout tower; a firefighter named Lu Wencai was injured in the head and feet and has been sent to Xianlong Hospital for treatment; and one landed in the old goods market on Nanxing Road. The second batch of six bombs landed consecutively south of Haichang Road, near the Fuxing First Flour Mill at the intersection of Changan Road along the Suzhou Creek. Many old burlap bag shops there immediately caught fire, and the Hengkang Rice Shop across the street was also burned down. The third batch of three bombs also landed to the left and right of the flour mill and at the eastern end of Changan Road. [Note:] At the time of this writing, the fire brigade is doing its best to put out the fire.</p>
<p>Also, according to reports, at around 9:00 AM, three enemy planes flew over Zhabei for a long time, dropping six bombs in the Dongbaoxing Road and Guangdong Street area. At 10:01 AM, several more enemy planes flew to the Zhabei Sun Temple, Republic New Road, Xinjiang Road, and Zhongshan Road areas, bombing indiscriminately, dropping five or six incendiary bombs near the Sun Temple, igniting three civilian houses instantly. The thick smoke filled the sky and is still burning. In addition, enemy planes dropped many absurd propaganda leaflets in various places in Zhabei this morning. Citizens picked them up, laughed at them, and tore them up.</p>
<p>Hongqiao</p>
<p>At 5:00 AM this morning, just as dawn was breaking, the small vegetable market in Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai was crowded with villagers selling vegetables, when it was suddenly bombed indiscriminately by three enemy planes. Five or six heavy bombs were dropped. Because they had been suffering from enemy air raids for days, the villagers had already taken precautions to hide, so there were only a little over a dozen casualties.</p>
<p>According to a person who came from Sijing this morning, a newspaper reported that enemy planes flew to the town yesterday and dropped bombs, but this did not happen.</p>
<p>Pudong</p>
<p>Four Japanese planes flew over the southern site of Zhangjiabang in Pudong at 8:00 AM this morning and strafed the area for an hour, unleashing machine-gun fire. They then crossed the Huangpu River to the Nanshi area, scouting along the river to Gaochangmiao and the Sun Hui Port area, dropping absurd leaflets. However, the people picked them up and tore them to pieces, not giving them a second glance.</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM today, three enemy heavy bombers took off from the northeast side of Pudong, circling around various places in the rear of Pudong. After one round of reconnaissance, they turned north along Pudong Avenue, dropping six or seven bombs in the Yangjiazha and Wujia Hall areas, aimlessly. Our army's fortifications were not damaged in any way.</p>
<p>Nanshi</p>
<p>From around 7:00 AM this morning, several enemy planes flew over Nanshi from time to time, continuously circling low over Gaochangmiao, Xietu Road, Longhua, Caohejing, and the Shanghai-Minhang Road for a long time. At around 10:00 AM, they gathered into a formation and flew west. When the planes were in the sky over the Shanghai-Minhang Road, they fired their machine guns indiscriminately downwards. A farmer who was plowing in the field did not have time to hide and was tragically wounded, but no bombs were dropped.</p>
<h3>In the Eastern Shanghai District, the Enemy Transports Our Property to Japan Again</h3>
<p>In the Eastern Shanghai District, the properties of our residents were not able to be taken out after the outbreak of the Shanghai War. In addition to confiscating all food, timber, and fuel coal for military use, the enemy once transported more than 2,000 boxes of our Eastern Shanghai District's metal parts and small industrial machinery to Japan. Now, they are loading another thousand boxes of the remaining items onto the No. 82 transport ship, converted from an enemy merchant ship, which is docked at the Huangpu Wharf, preparing to transport them to Japan again, starting this morning (the 20th).</p>
<h3>Brief Commentary</h3>
<p>Another Iron Proof of the Enemy Planes' Atrocities</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Songhu War, enemy planes have been wreaking havoc everywhere, treating it as their daily task. Not only are they not satisfied with slaughtering our civilians, but they even bombed and injured the British Ambassador to China, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen. After the British government lodged a serious protest, they apologized only after being unable to argue their way out of it. Unexpectedly, not long after, British Embassy Air Force Captain Murray and others were attacked again. This case is still under negotiation. But yesterday, the military attaché of the Italian Embassy, Libizzi, and a German citizen were bombed on the Suzhou Road. Although they were not injured, they were thoroughly frightened. Italy and Germany are our friendly nations and also the enemy's partner nations. Yet, their officials and businessmen cannot avoid being bombed. Such madness is bound to be condemned by the whole world. The enemy's diplomacy is becoming increasingly isolated, and they are on the road to self-destruction.</p>

<h3>From Tianjin to Shanghai</h3>
<p>An Oppressed Man Recounts His Experience</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch) It has been nearly three months since the fall of Peiping (Beijing) and Tianjin. My friend, Mr. Yang, has been doing business in North China for over a decade. Since the enemy occupied Tianjin, his entire family has suffered inhumane treatment under the enemy's iron heel, repeatedly subjected to searches and arrests, barely escaping death. Only last Monday was he able to disguise himself as a coolie and take a British ship from Tianjin to Shanghai, enduring seven days of hardship. Upon arriving in Shanghai, he met with a reporter, claiming to have been reborn. What he discussed about the situation in the north, concerning matters that have already passed, will not be recorded. Now, I will extract and record a few details of his journey south:</p>
<p>Popular Aspirations in Peiping and Tianjin</p>
<p>Mr. Yang stated that after the enemy troops occupied Tianjin, their arrogance and barbaric behavior were truly infuriating. Thousands of young people and students were killed, a fact that the South should already know. Currently in Tianjin, except for the concessions, in the Chinese areas and the surrounding villages, there are virtually no women left. Elderly women in their sixties and seventies are often raped, and young girls are abducted to military camps for their animalistic desires, with those who resist being shot. In Chinese shops, the enemy takes whatever they want without paying. Items like eyeglasses, watches, and telescopes in watch stores are seen as spoils of war. The enemy often comes to take them, and the merchants have to force a smile to please them. Shanghai newspapers, in the beginning, were still delivered to the Tianjin post office, but after the enemy sent people to inspect them, they burned them daily, along with printed materials and letters. Tianjin is very isolated from news from the South, but the people of Peiping and Tianjin all eagerly hope for the early arrival of the Central Army and are particularly concerned about the Shanghai battles. The only hope for the people is to listen to the war reports from the Central Radio Station on the radio. Recently, the enemy sometimes impersonates the Central Radio Station, fabricating news of the Shanghai battles, distorting the truth and confusing right and wrong. Sometimes they use radio waves to interfere, making it impossible for radios to receive signals, leaving the people of Peiping and Tianjin unable to obtain news of the war in the South, causing them indescribable frustration. As for the "Yong Bao" (庸報 - Common Newspaper), which specializes in spreading rumors for the enemy, it uses the enemy's power to force Tianjin shops and residents to subscribe, even assigning a copy to every "tiger stove" (public bath house) for one yuan per month. If they don't read the paper, they are accused of being anti-Japanese. The other day, news of the Central Air Force bombing Tanggu reached Tianjin, and the enthusiastic joy of the people was beyond description. The people of Peiping and Tianjin greatly admire the soldiers of the Twenty-ninth Army, and do not lightly forgive ☓☓☓☓☓. Recently, they have been eagerly anticipating the northward advance of the Central Army. Whenever a foreign ship arrives in Tianjin from Shanghai, they make every effort to inquire, and they are overjoyed when they hear of the great victories of our army in the Shanghai battles.</p>
<p>Seven Days of Painful Sea Voyage</p>
<p>In the past two months, at least 200,000 people have fled from Peiping and Tianjin, most of them landing in Yantai and then transferring to the provinces of Henan, Shandong, Shaanxi, and Shanxi. Others have landed in Qingdao, and many have also come to Shanghai. However, buying tickets is very difficult. Mr. Yang did not manage to buy a third-class cabin ticket on a Swire Shipping ship until the 10th of this month, paying a premium of twenty yuan. He could only occupy a space on the open deck. The journey from Tianjin to Shanghai took a full seven days and seven nights, and the suffering of the passengers was indescribable. As the ship passed the mouth of Tanggu, as far as the eye could see, the enemy's bullets, artillery shells, and bombs were being unloaded from transport ships and piled up on the docks. The ship stopped in Yantai for a day and night, anchored offshore, and passengers could not land. It was not until the ship reached Qingdao that we were able to disembark. Currently, Qingdao has become a dead city. Residents, young and old, are under strict guard day and night, preparing for enemy air raids.</p>
<p>The Current Situation as Seen in Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Haikou" ship sailed outside Wusong Port at noon. When Mr. Yang was in the north, he could not know the true situation of the Shanghai battles. Therefore, as the ship passed Wugu Guasha (裹鍋沙), he looked out from the deck and could already see the enemy warships invading our Shanghai. From Wugu Guasha all the way to Wusong Port, there was a ship every so often, of varying sizes, totaling nearly forty ships. Some of the enemy ships could be seen to have just arrived from Japan, fully loaded with troops and military equipment. Their draft was sunk to the load line, proving how much they were carrying. Inside Wusong Port, up to the Garden Bridge, there were scattered enemy ships, about seventeen or eighteen. The "Izumo" in front of buoy number two was surrounded by large iron barges, and the ship was full of sandbags, even the smokestacks were covered with wire mesh. Entering the Wusong Port, the most shocking sight was the area from Wusong to Yunzaobang, where the magnificent buildings of factories and warehouses that once stood in rows were now all broken walls and ruins, with not a single one intact. As far as the eye could see, it was a scene of utter devastation. On the open space east of the Qiujiang Wharf, there were one or two thousand enemy horses, arriving but unable to be used, as well as hundreds of transport trucks. The flat-bottomed small military barges in the Huangpu River, which we had never seen before, were now everywhere. In the Yunzaobang area, there were even large quantities of rafts, and transport ships converted from merchant ships docked at various wharves were busily unloading military equipment and loading wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Plundering Civilian Ships and Goods</p>
<p>Among the passengers who came to Shanghai on the same ship this time were twenty-five people who disembarked from Yantai. All of them were from Shaoxing and stated that they had been transporting passengers and goods along the Shanghai-to-Beiyang route with two large sand ships (each carrying 600 tons). The shipowner was surnamed Zhou. This time, while carrying two ships of goods, they sailed to the sea near Yantai at the beginning of this month and were intercepted by enemy warships. The ships and goods were all confiscated, and even the crew's luggage, clothing, and money were all looted. They even wanted to burn all twenty-five people on the two ships alive. After repeated pleas, they were tied up and locked in the ships, and were only released after being starved for four days. A gangplank was finally lowered and the twenty-five people were driven ashore at Longkou. Fortunately, they had acquaintances in Yantai who were fellow villagers, who managed to scrape together four hundred yuan to buy some clothes with about three hundred yuan and buy ship tickets, thus managing to return alive. However, the total loss of the ships and goods was over fifty thousand yuan. After Mr. Yang landed and observed the situation in Shanghai, he vehemently told the reporter, "The greatness of our national strength and the resilience of the unity between the military and the people are evident everywhere in the South. Victory in the war is assured. For three months in the North, I felt so oppressed that I could not breathe. Today, as soon as I arrived in Shanghai, the pent-up anger in my chest was finally relieved!" (Heart in Danger)</p>
<h3>International Problems Research Association Cables Nine-Power Treaty Signatories</h3>
<p>Stating Opinions and Expectations Regarding the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>Yesterday, the International Problems Research Association telegraphed the signatory nations of the Nine-Power Treaty, stating our country's opinions on the Sino-Japanese dispute, as well as the expectations of our country's citizens before the Nine-Power Treaty conference. The telegram was signed by honorary directors Yen Hui-ching (顏惠慶), directors Li Zhaohuan (黎照寰), Liu Zhanen (劉湛恩), Dong Xianguang (董顯光), Chen Guangfu (陳光甫), Qian Xinzhi (錢新之), He Dekui (何德奎), Dai Zhiqian (戴志騫), and others. The original telegram stated in brief, "The Washington Nine-Power Treaty conference is about to be held in Brussels, the capital of Belgium. As it is the duty of our association, we hereby issue the following statement, in order to explain the important legal and political issues involved in Japan's invasion of our country. The current conflict is essentially a continuation of Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931. After Japan annexed Manchuria and Jehol and established a puppet government there, it began various activities, using conspiracies and force, to separate North China from Chinese rule and make it independent. Japan has increased its garrison in Peiping and Tianjin without any legitimate reason, exceeding the number permitted by the 1901 Boxer Protocol by as much as four times. In the past, we could still recall that after the Chinese government moved its capital to Nanking and the relocation of the residences of foreign envoys in China, the importance of foreign troops protecting the railway line from Peiping to the coast had decreased. The Japanese militarists brazenly disregarded this, concentrated heavy troops in North China, and frequently held exercises in places not allowed by the terms of the Boxer Protocol, which led to the incident of July 8th, when they clashed with our garrison at Lugou Bridge. The Chinese government has done everything possible to seek a peaceful resolution, even withdrawing our troops, but Japan still expanded its military operations according to its predetermined plan to the five provinces of Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Shandong, an area of 700,000 square miles, and further forcibly occupied Peiping, Tianjin, and the Hai River, aiming to thoroughly implement its policy of conquering China by force. In order to connect with the war in North China, it also started a war in Shanghai, the center of our finances and economy, attempting to destroy our country's resistance in one fell swoop. Thus, it used the pretext of the Hongqiao incident (which was caused by Japanese armed sailors trying to break into our airport on August 9th) to concentrate a huge fleet in Shanghai within 48 hours, and landed a large number of troops, launching a large-scale attack on Zhabei outside the public concession. Japan's military operations in China's vast territory have lasted for more than three months and cannot be considered self-defense. It should be regarded as Japan's violation of its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the former requiring each signatory to respect the territorial and administrative integrity of China, and the latter condemning war as an instrument of national policy. As for the legal issues involved in the Shanghai incident, it is the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement of 1932. However, before the war in Shanghai, Japan built huge fortresses along the border of the public concession and stationed troops in Baziqiao. In fact, the agreement had already been violated by the Japanese side. The Chinese government, in view of Japan's invasion of North China and its dangerous schemes, was forced to order the necessary mobilization of troops in order to fulfill its primary responsibility of defending its territory. This action did not violate the Shanghai Ceasefire Agreement. Moreover, the agreement never had a provision that permanently restricted the movement of Chinese troops within Chinese territory. Therefore, the responsibility for the war in Shanghai, which is similar to the undeclared war in North China by the Japanese army, must be borne by the Japanese side. Furthermore, since the outbreak of the war, the Japanese militarists have used all kinds of methods to trample on our ports, declared an illegal blockade of our entire coast, and used all kinds of mechanized weapons of modern warfare to wantonly bomb our cities. Almost all of our cities have been ravaged by Japanese aircraft, and a large number of innocent civilians, including refugees, women, and children, have been brutally murdered. Cultural institutions such as schools and hospitals have been destroyed. There is no need to elaborate on the shock and hatred that all of this has caused to people all over the world. Japan, in theory, is still at peace with China, but even if it were formally declared, Japan's actions have violated Article 25 of the Hague Peace Conference resolutions, which prohibits the bombing of undefended cities, etc., as well as the universally recognized principles of international law during wartime that distinguish between non-combatants and combatants. Furthermore, the bombing of Red Cross ambulance teams by Japanese airmen is even more shameful and violates the Geneva Convention of 1929. In view of the above circumstances, we have to conclude that Japan is now continuing its continental invasion plan that began in Manchuria in 1931. China, being the victim of Japan's invasion in the most brutal way, has no other way but to do its best to resist. We firmly believe that the dignity of treaties and the safety of nations must be collective in nature. Therefore, we can only appeal to the countries participating in the upcoming Nine-Power Treaty conference to not allow this Japanese aggression against China to set a dangerous precedent, and to resolutely take concerted action, including effective sanctions, to deal with the aggressor."</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Town Chief Arbitrarily Releases Seized Cattle</p>
<p>Near Wulitang, Tongbo Town, outside the north gate of this city, at about 10 PM on the 13th, more than sixty head of cattle were being led by cattle traders when they were spotted by patrolling militiamen, who questioned and temporarily detained them. The cattle traders initially resisted arrest and then attempted to bribe the militiamen with one hundred yuan. The militiamen fired warning shots. Subsequently, Xie Zhi (謝志), the town chief of the town, released them out of favoritism. The militiamen argued that they were under orders to seize the cattle, but the town chief released them without authorization, suggesting something improper. Therefore, they rushed to the Third District Security Command to report the matter overnight. According to the report, the district headquarters is secretly investigating.</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Frequently Pass Over Songjiang</p>
<p>From dawn to noon on the 14th, enemy planes came to Songjiang a total of eight times, flying very high. No bombs were dropped in the urban area, but explosions were heard in the northeast corner. It is reported that bombs were dropped in Qibao and Qingpu, etc., with four or five bombs dropped. The extent of the damage is under investigation.</p>
<h3>Taizhou</h3>
<p>Enemy Attempt to Land Repulsed</p>
<p>At 12 PM on the 10th, several dozen enemy soldiers suddenly arrived at Chumen Town, Yuhuan County, on three small motorboats, and attempted to land in the Xuanmen Port. Our defending troops opened fire and bombarded them, and the enemy ships retreated to the open sea.</p>

<h3>Strictly Prevent Dock Workers from Being Exploited by the Enemy</h3>
<p>No Excuses Allowed to Shirk Responsibility. Severe Punishment Will Be Imposed Upon Detection</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dock Workers' Improvement Society yesterday issued a notice to all workers, stating, "The country is currently facing a serious crisis. It is disheartening that dock workers in this city have always been disorganized, and some have been unknowingly exploited by the enemy. Therefore, Chairman Ye and Committee Member Xiasheng of the Society have requested the highest authorities to reorganize and restructure the society on their behalf. Notification No. 15 from the Chief Secretary has been forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters for verification. However, in the current all-out war of resistance, all citizens should unanimously support the government and strengthen the forces against the enemy. Even before the Society receives verification from the Municipal Party Headquarters, all steps should be taken in a unified manner. In addition to the concrete measures already planned for unemployed workers, all dock workers who have registered with the Society, regardless of the time, are absolutely prohibited from being exploited by the enemy and from loading, unloading, and transporting military equipment and goods for them, or any other work. No excuses of being forced or coerced will be allowed to shirk responsibility. If any of the above circumstances occur, the Society will impose the most severe punishment. If anyone is injured due to resisting the enemy, the Society will submit a special report to the authorities to request compensation. This notice is hereby issued."</p>
<h3>Qu Zhenhua Suggests Enacting a Law to Punish Embezzlement of Donations</h3>
<p>Embezzling Donations Should Be Punished by Death. Accomplices Are Jointly Responsible</p>
<p>Mr. Qu Zhenhua, a leader in the Shanghai business community, yesterday suggested to the Second Special District Citizens' Federation that it forward a request to the government to quickly enact an emergency law to punish crimes during this extraordinary period. Any person in charge of raising, administering, or receiving funds for national salvation donations, relief donations, consolation donations, medical donations, and all other donations, as well as any fundraising organizations, who engages in self-enrichment, embezzlement of donations, or directly or indirectly profits from their actions, shall be sentenced to death upon discovery. All accomplices who collude in the fraud shall also be jointly responsible and punished with the same penalty, in order to deter others and uphold the law. At the same time, letters should be sent to military and police agencies, various organizations, and the offices of all fundraising efforts, urging them to strictly monitor each other. If any suspicious points arise, they must be reported as much as possible. In addition, all law enforcement agencies should act in good conscience and according to the law, without favoritism or perfunctoriness, and must thoroughly investigate and strictly handle the cases in order to concentrate financial resources and strengthen the forces of resistance. Whether or not this is appropriate, please put it to a vote.</p>

<h3>The Belief That Resistance Will Surely Lead to Victory</h3>
<p>— Guo Woli (郭我力)</p>
<p>In recent years, Japanese warlords, for the sake of their promotion and wealth, have treated our beautiful land, lives, and property as fish and meat on their chopping block, wanting to cut and carve them up piece by piece to satisfy their insatiable desires. After swallowing the four northeastern provinces, they continued to attempt to take North China, and even Central and South China.</p>
<p>Violating all treaties of peace, disregarding the public laws that must be observed, flaunting their strong armor and sharp weapons, they fully exploit their robber-like character, wanting to destroy our entire China and then feel happy. Now, the all-out war of resistance has begun. The fighting in the past fifty days has exposed the weaknesses and ugly appearance of the enemy bandits. Facts tell us that only by resisting to the end and sacrificing to the end can we achieve the true liberation and ultimate glory of the nation!</p>
<p>Our oath to resist to the death has gained international sympathy and shifted international attitudes. Spiritual support will inevitably evolve into material assistance in the future, or at least lead to a thorough economic blockade of the enemy, which is their fatal wound. No matter how strong they are, they will inevitably collapse.</p>
<p>It is better to rely on oneself than to rely on others. While we urgently hope for international assistance, we must still strive and not rely on it. The final victory belongs to us, and this is not empty boasting. A comparison of national strengths shows sufficient reason to be sure of victory. The current war, if it lacks the important condition of economy, the future is indeed pessimistic. The enemy is a small island, inherently deficient, with industrial raw materials for civilian and military use all dependent on international supplies. Our country is vast and rich in resources, long regarded as the lifeline. In the past, due to people's obsession and politics not being on the right track, it has not been fully developed. Now, while supporting the long-term war of resistance, we are also launching a large-scale wartime development of natural resources, training the people, organizing the people, and arming the people. Working together with one heart, we are catching up rapidly. We can inflict serious blows on the enemy anytime, anywhere. Let alone a small island, what is there to fear from ten or eight of them?</p>
<p>We must also thoroughly understand ourselves. After uniting with sincerity and under the leadership of the most loyal and brave commander-in-chief, we have formed a solid wall of defense with orderly steps. No matter how overwhelming the force, it will not be enough to frustrate our anti-Japanese war of resistance. Moreover, the enemy suffers from internal imbalance and an unsound structure. The ancient saying goes, "Those who love to kill will surely be killed." The fate of some warmongers in history is inevitable collapse. The final stage of the Japanese warlords' invasion of China can be determined.</p>
<p>Youth are the vanguard of the people, especially the educated youth, who are the people's daredevils. Therefore, to complete this sacred cause of national liberation, we must first have this firm belief that resistance will surely lead to victory and lead the people in a fight to the death.</p>
