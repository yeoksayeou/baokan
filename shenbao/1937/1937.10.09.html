<p>［南京］外交部長王寵惠八日接見記者、發表談話如下、中國此次抗戰、純係為維持正義與人道、近數過來、諸多事實、使人欣慰、卽世界愛好和平各國、亦均一致興起、同與中國集於此種鮮明旗幟之下、世界各地之民衆團體、旣通過多數决議、向吾中國民衆表示熱深切之同情、而各國之大政治家、以及各界領袖、對於日本之侵略中國、尤以對於日本之殘殺中國平民、亦在日內瓦及其他各地、同聲譴責、余對於此種團體或個人、在吾國此次國難中所予吾人之一切道德及精神的援助、茲謹代表中國政府及中國人民、表示誠懇之感謝、蓋中國政府及人民、固始終深信眞理與正義、終必戰勝强權也、國聯大會關於中日事件最近所通過之决議案、及第一第二兩報吿書、雖與中國所希望國聯按照盟約可以採取之行動、尚覺有所未足但已足明白表示全體文明、世界對於中國此次之抵抗侵略、至少精神上係與中國同情、而願為中國後盾、日此項報吿書、並已確定一重要事實、卽日本此次行動、為破壤其條約義務、尤為破壤其在九國公約非戰公約下之義務、絕對無可辯護、今茲所希望者、則為迅籌積極辦法、使日本對於國際條約及正義人道根本原則之任意的破壤得以中止、又關於此次日本侵略中國事件、美國國務院現已與國聯採取同一之結論、六日美國務院所發表之聲明、卽謂日本舉動、實與調節國際關係之原則不合、且與九國公約非戰公約之規定相背、又數日前、美總統羅斯福在芝加哥之演說、尤獲得一切愛好和平國家之傾誠贊助、羅氏所申述之各原則、正可謂恰當其時、而足為美國與國聯、共同努力、遏止國際侵略之基礎、羅氏演說中雖未嘗明言中日衝突、然彼指出之和平危機、業已存在於現在遠東形勢之中、要無疑義、羅氏復鄭重申言、謂無論何國、均决不可希冀以孤立或中立逃避國際混亂不安之可怖的結果、尤為確切不易之論、只有一切維護和平之國家、明乎此理、同心協力、挽回潮流、庶可使國際道德、不致完全摧毀耳、茲者、國聯內外世界之一致輿論、均已承認在遠東方面重要之和平條約、業被摧殘、現在文明世界當前之問題、卽為如何恢復國際條約之尊嚴而拯救斯世、使不致復返終國際之大混亂、自一九三一年遠東事變以迄於現在之日本大舉侵略中國、種種事實、已足證明對於軍閥柄政藐視輿論之日本僅恃陳述道義通過議案、不足抑制其侵略、如欲恢復遠東和平、勢非愛好和平之各國、採取積極辦法、以維護法律與道德之尊嚴、不克奏功、羅斯福總統曾云、“一切願在國際道德標準下以生存於和平之國家、可覓取途徑、且應覓取途徑、以使彼等志願得以戰勝暴亂不法之惡勢力”、余實完全贊同也、（八日中央社電）</p>
<h3>九國公約國會議美國聲明出席</h3>
<p>羅斯福返京召開閣議　台維斯奉召抵華盛頓</p>
<p>［華盛頓］國務卿赫爾頃向各報發表談話、略謂、關於九國公約簽字國會議、國務務院迄今尚未接獲請柬、但渠意一俟請柬遞到之後、美國當接受參加、有人叩以國務院昨日發表公報譴責日本之舉、是否足以引起中立法之實施、赫爾答稱、此項公報、純粹以九國公約與巴黎非戰公約為出發點、至南美洲九國是否同意一層、則國務院在發表公報之前、並未徵詢各該國之意見、則以美國係以九國公約簽字國之資格、單獨採取此項决定故也、或又叩以外傳九國公約簽字國會議、將在華盛頓舉行之說、是否確鑿、赫爾無所表示、對於前國務卿史汀生所主張英美應共同抵制日本一層亦不願加以批評、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］羅斯福總統今晨返京後、卽於午後召開內閣會議、討論國際合作阻止戰爭及召開國會特別會議等間題、總統出巡西北部各州、係於今晨八時三十分抵京、政府官員在車站歡迎者甚衆（八日國民）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］美國政界要人台維斯、屢任美國專使、出席歐洲各項主要會議、現奉急召由紐約來華盛頓、已於今晨抵此、卽與羅斯福總統及國務卿赫爾討論美國參加九國會議辦法、（中央社八日路透電）</p>
<p>［紐約］頃據紐約秦晤士報載稱、九國公約簽字國會議倘在倫敦舉行、則美國政府大約將派台維斯特使前往出席、按台維斯係羅斯福總統之知友、凡遇重大外交問題、輒由台維斯代表美國政府赴歐從事折衝、因而有“駐歐專使”之稱（中央社八日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>［倫敦］九國公約開會地點、現尚未决定、關於開會手績、刻正循外交途徑、積極討論（中央社八日路透）</p>
<h3>太平洋會議德亦不參加</h3>
<p>［柏林］美國國務院昨日發表公報之後、德國政界人士雖拒不加以評論、但均承認此舉具有驚人性質、并謂德國在遠東方面保有重大經濟利益、自當特切注視時局發展情形、德國旣非華府九國公約簽字國、對於中日糾紛仲裁工作、自不願出而參加云、（中央社七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>日大使齋藤訪晤赫爾</h3>
<p>英大使訪日外次</p>
<p>［華盛頓］日本駐美大使齋藤博今日訪晤國務卿赫爾、聞以交換情報為目的、事後齋滕語入、渠對於國聯院斥責日本在華行為之言論、並未提出任何抗議、但渠自動訪晤赫爾、說明某種消息、渠不以為國務院之宣言將使美日關係臻於緊張、渠意遠東衝突中之新近進展、可肅淸空氣、而促成兩國間更好之諒解云、（中央社七日路透電）</p>

<p>［東京］今晨各報對美國務院聲明皆著論反對、朝日新聞謂、羅斯福演說、赫爾聲明、似以予國聯精神援助為目的、且可為國內一部輿論與行動之安全辯、美國對極東向有正當認識、徵諸已往行動、可窺見對今茲事變、因急求目前戰局終止、而未究原因、於不充分認識下、謀時局解决、勢必徒增糾紛、各國行動結果，只助長中國戰意、國聯自招與其目的相反之事態、不可不察等語、日日新聞對美態度表示驚異與遺憾復辯稱、非戰公約並非否認任何戰爭、故對自衛戰爭、制裁戰爭、並不禁止、美國及各國僅見表面現、或爲虚　所迷、而出輕舉、動機縱　、亦於世界和平及維持正義有大害等語、都新開謂日本將立於四面楚歌之境、今後難關、須有覺悟、一步不容後退等語、讀賣新聞謂、國聯美國欲加日以條約侵犯者之名、而召集會議、當然不接受、太平洋會議不外二辦法、一限於道德制裁、一再交國聯實行經濟封鎖、美國在會議有决定的支配力、不可不注意等語、其餘各報大同小異、（八日中央社電）</p>
<h3>日擬廢棄九國公約</h3>
<p>日證券大跌</p>
<p>［東京］日內閣今日會議討論國聯及美政府對於中日衝突發表宣言後、所引起之變化、聞日方擬將担保中國政治土地完整之九國公約宣吿廢止、有謂該約之宣吿廢棄、已屆不可避免之地步者、刻日本證券交易市塲、因美國國務院發表宣言譴責日本暴行之故、已大為驚惶、多數證券已見慘跌云、（中央社八日路透電）</p>

<h3>德當局否認軍火接濟日本</h3>
<p>［柏林］外傳德國已經或將與日本締結合同、以四千萬瑞士法郎之軍火售予日本、此間負責當局頃鄭重加以駿斥、謂來具日本訂立任何關於軍火之合同、上項傳說、絕對無精云、（八日國民海通電）</p>

<p>專論</p>
<h3>澈底對日經濟絕交</h3>
<p>— 武堉幹</p>
<p>我們對於暴日的抵抗，不僅要靠武力，並且還要充分實施經濟抵制。所以這幾天來上海市商會等圑體，極力倡導對日經濟絕交，而同時全世界表同情於中國的人士，也都紛紛鼓吹排斥日貨，足見經濟抵制力量的偉大，實不下於武力，業已為全世界所公認了。</p>
<p>不過要全世界各國的人民，眞的能够帮着我們去抵制日貨，實際上怕也狠難。要曉得他們宣稱抵制日貸，原來祇是伸張公道，表示義憤；要眞的實行起來，他們有許多切身的利害關係，都不能不先打算。去年世界各國，不是為着阿比西尼亚而抵制意貨，對意經濟制裁嗎？效果又在那裹呢？要曉得在各國對日的國際關係根本未起變化以前，希望他們抵制日貨有效，實在狠難。因為在一般情形之下，公道的仗義，總敵不過自己的經濟利益打算。譬如日本重要的進口貨棉花，由美国和印度進口的，每年都在四萬萬元上下，試問她們都能犧牲偌大一筆出口利益，而去抵制日本的大宗生絲或棉布進口嗎？又日本的羊毛，差不多全部來自澳洲，試問澳洲能否犧牲她那兩萬萬元一年的羊毛生意而去抵制日本的棉布雑貨進口呢？我們祇看這幾天國際聯盟開會，一討論到對日經濟制裁，英帝國殖民地的代表，便有點躲躲閃閃不敢開罪的意思，也就可以想見國際帮助中國抵制日貨的前途了。</p>
<p>所以眞的要抵制日貨，只有我們自己切實去做；並且我們不僅抵制日貨，還要對日斷絕一切經濟關係，才能收到經濟抵制的效果。狠奇怪的，我們自七月七日蘆溝橋發動武力抗戰以來，已整整的三個月，為甚麼我們不同時實施經濟抗戰，對日斷絕一切經濟關係呢？現在發動對日經濟絕交，在我們長期的抗日戰事中，雖還不算狠遲；可是從現在起，必須要澈底實施，不要徒然當作一種具文，方才有狠大的效果。我們要曉得過去兩三個月內，我們不能做到對日經濟絕交，一方面固然由於在日本武力侵佔的區域，貨物進出口的大權，都操在他們手裹；他們儘可利用一般漢奸，來替他們推銷一切包攬一切，自然也就有一批批的奸商去通敵往來，因綠為利；同時也許有人藉口合同的約束，或者為着私交的感情；所以不能不暫時維持對日的經濟關係。可是到現在，這些事情都不應該讓他們再存在了。</p>
<p>我們現在最要緊的，勿論在戰區或非戰區，都要嚴厲警戒，用堅壁淸野的方法，密切注意漢奸的活動和一般人無意中資敵的舉動。凡是販賣敵貨或售貸於敵，或替敵人服役，或與敵人發生任何一切經濟關係的，都應當由政府以通敵論罪。便是我國在日本國內設立的那些銀行商店，也應當收束回國，斬斷經濟上的葛藤。日本倚賴我國商業經濟的利益最大，我們也祇有斷絕和她的商業經濟關係，纔足以給她以重大打擊。我們以為現在對日經濟絕交，最低限度需要做到下列幾點：</p>
<p>㊀要使海關冊中，今後沒有日貨的進口和對日本的出口數字。假使有的話，我們便應追查來源：誰是通敵，不難査到水落石出；便是洋行出面代辦，也無妨間接追查明白，以期澈底根絕來源。要像過去八月份的滬戰期中，江海關的進口日貨還有七百多萬金單位，那我們前綫的浴血戰爭，眞是白費力氣。</p>
<p>㊁要使內地已經進口的日貨，封存不得販賣。各地商會和同業公會應急起執行這事，不得允許奸商假借任何理由來出售他們所購存的日貨，尤應防止他們改頭換面的冒充別國貨物，甚或冒充國貨出售。我們知道滬戰未起的時候，上海奸商曾經以大批日貨報運長江下游各埠，以致出口輪船一次水脚有達十萬元以上者，運銷日貨本身的價額之巨，更可想而知。若果舊存日貨禁止發賣，便可阻絕奸商續進日貨的企圖，這也是正本淸源所必需的工作。</p>
<p>㊂要使所有在敵人公私機關團體工商行號中服務的人，都退出來：尤其在敵人商船兵艦中服務的，無論水手生火或領港，都應急速退出他們所直接加害於祖国的工作。我们的海員工會，更屬義不容辭的，聯絡世界各地海員，去負賣督促這個工作。現在各處戰區和非戰區中，都還有不少替敵人服役或保管一切產業器物的，甚或有拿敵人的通行證在敵人侵佔區域往來的，這種人如不退出，也應當作漢奸論罪。</p>
<p>㊃要使所有對日的公私債務，立卽停止或延期支付。前些日子，我們政府一面在對日抗戰激烈的時候，一面還照付日本的賠償債款。這在我們政府極力顧全信用方面説，自然不可厚非，但是這種“齊盜糧”的辦法，於抗戰的前途也太危險了。有人疑心我們若不付款，敵入就會掠奪侵佔區城的海關，那麼全部稅收都會損失。我希望這些推測之談不是車實眞相。因為我們旣然為着正義公道民族生存種種理由而抗戰，業已不恤犧牲一切，難道還想叨惠敵人佔領下面一點點稅款？我們只要認為停止支付敵人債款，是可加强我们抗戰力量的,我們便應毫不遲疑的去作。這也是政府和人民對日抗戰决心的具體表現呢。</p>
<p>總之，經濟絕交必須要澈底的實施，才有效果。這不必完全倚賴政府，最要還是希望各地商會和同業公會嚴厲執行實施。怕的有些資力雄厚的奸商，他們可以勾結敵人或暗託外商因緣為利，行使鬼蜮計劃，這就要政府和全國人民，隨時予以注意監察，作嚴厲的懲處了。我們希望這一次的偉大的對日經濟絕交，能和武力抗戰一樣，完成空前未有的最大效果！</p>
<h3>敵突進觀音堂陣地經我三面圍攻恢復原防</h3>
<p>廣福鎮東南面我軍包抄殲敵　敵昨犯賀家巷被我迎頭痛擊　蕰藻浜敵三路偷渡剿滅殆盡</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者八日晚八時半報告、江灣復旦大學南首觀音堂附近、我軍警戒綫、於本日淸晨四時、曾被進犯之敵軍、突破一點、惟敵亦不敢深入、旋經我三面圍攻、並抄襲其側背、猛攻不久、卽將其擊退、恢復原防、又八字橋及廣東街兩處、敵我各守原陣、嚴密警戒、雖有數度前哨接觸、但隨卽停止、惟敵方之砲火甚為猛烈、敵機數架、亦不斷投彈、並以機槍掃射、我工事及駐軍絕無損傷、又今晨零時二十分報告、江灣閘北一綫、昨晨至晚僅有數處前哨接觸、而敵機亦曾於近晚時一度活動、惟雙方砲轟則斷續司聞、至約五時、敵軍二中隊在戰車七輛之掩護下、由泗涇球塲出動、向我市立公墓賀家巷警戒綫猛烈進犯、度敵人之意、係乘虛突擊、其實我軍全綫有整個配備、敵軍此舉　顯屬徒勞、我軍見敵逼近、卽予迎頭痛擊、平射砲大肆威力、當將敵車轟燬一輛、並斃敵三十餘、敵見勢不佳、乃列車為陣、與我對壘、報告時、尚在激戰中、槍砲聲及手溜彈爆炸聲、混成一片、惟我陣地則屹然未動、</p>
<p>敵犯廣福鎮束南面被我痛擊卒未得逞</p>
<p>劉行方面之敵、連日斷向我廣福鎮之正面及左右兩冀進犯、經我分頭截擊後、正面之敵、受創奇重、故自前午起、敵已不敢再來、改由兩冀突擊、敵尤側重左冀、企圖壓迫我軍後退、而興南岸之部隊呼應、以防我襲擊其側背、惟我軍早洞悉敵計、在該處駐有重兵、𡃫密戒備、不使敵有尺之進晨拂曉、一千人以上之兵力、向廣福東南孟家宅老陸宅附近進犯、我軍沉着應戰、敵終未得逞、東北方面、敵於昨晨三時向陳家宅進犯、我軍奮勇迎擊．肉搏數次、卒將其擊退、敵狠狽援退時、遺下機關槍四挺、及其他軍械等甚多均為我截獲、</p>
<p>中央社蘇州八日電、連日我軍在羅店西北方、與敵台灣步兵第一二兩聯隊激戰甚烈、我軍奮勇襲擊、敵傷亡慘重、敵遺屍可證實姓名者、中隊長千男大尉、山口少尉、西原有田兩少尉、蒞鋤工兵大尉等五名、并於遺屍身畔、搜獲文件及日記甚多、其日記中對作戰前途、均抱悲觀、其士氣頹喪、可以想見、</p>
<p>敵由東寶興路進犯被我夾擊受創奇重</p>
<p>中央社云、本社隨軍記者八日午十二時四十五分報告、北四川路之敵、七日晚又由東寶興路進犯、我軍奮起截殺、在大雨滂沱中、展開激烈巷戰、至昨晨二時敵始掩旗息鼓而去、其間並有兩次空前砲戰、我方所發重砲、標的凖確、敵受創之餘、知該處我軍戒備森嚴、無隙可乘、故改變方針、於四時許、由六三花園及日本墳墓兩處、沿橫浜東岸進犯、其時我前哨兵士已過八字橋向柳營路推進、與敵遭遇、而我駐粵東中學之部隊、亦沿水電路出擊、亦同時趕到、夾擊敵軍、其時敵軍砲隊及坦克車、已由同濟路調往他處、故實力單薄、胆怯異常、我軍乃奮勇上前、與敵肉搏、血戰三小時、殲敵九十餘、大勝返陣、至江灣方面、前昨兩日均甚安靜、蓋敵正傾其全力圖突破我竇山路八字橋之陣地、已無餘力進犯該處、昨晨六時至十時、兩處間有砲聲、惟不甚激烈、</p>
<p>敵屢向閘北猛攻、均無進展、且該處全係市街、進攻不易、故敵自六日起、又用新武器火砲轟炸、目的在焚燬民房、威脅我軍、敵第一次施用時、其衝鋒之步兵、經我機闕檢擊退、未能奏效、敵軍近來一再施用新式而非法之武器、可見其所受打擊之重大、與往滬作戰之艱困、</p>
<p>偷渡蕰藻浜之敵軍三路圍剿殲滅盡</p>
<p>蕰藻浜沿岸三處戰事、前夜（七日）因大雨稍停、又激烈展開、迄昨晨未此、三處戰情如下、㊀由東楊宅渡過浜南而集結於嚴宅及杜宅之敵、前夜向徐宅進犯、經我奮勇截殺、殱減大半、至昨晨其殘部侷處岸邊、進退失據、狀至狼狽、㊁集據張家宅之敵、經我軍圍攻多時、敵終困守不出、我軍乃施展妙計、先伏兵近處、乃佯示敗退、誘敵追擊、在倪家園附近伏兵四起、將敵包圍、激戰至昨晨未停、㊂唐橋姜家宅葦灣三處、敵乃在架橋、以便源源增援、我軍見其渡至半途、卽以機關槍左右掃射、敵軍中彈紛紛落水、當時溺斃及擊斃者約二百餘、</p>
<p>中央社隨軍記者八日晚八時半報告、蕰藻浜北岸敵軍、於前日在東楊宅附近偸渡者僅一二百人、正佈置陣地時、卽被我突起猛襲、當殲減大部、至本日拂曉、我又由嚴家灣張家宅兩處出擊、卒將其殘部逐去、敵慌忙竄退、失足落水者不少、小部敵軍在浜岸打撈、我以機機掃射、又發生激戰、江家宅附近、敵續圖偸渡、我早有凖備、俟其渡過一部、卽躍出衝擊、襲敵六十餘、並截獲輕機關機一挺、步槍多支、當時並有小船四隻、已渡至半途、我軍追擊砲手溜彈密集轟擊、將其擊沉、敵溺斃不少、</p>
<p>我軍重砲予敵重創威脅之下謂須報復</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今晨（八日）日軍發言人向外報訪員聲稱、日陸軍向於反攻浦東華軍砲隊時、不損毀外人任何產業、茲因昨夜華軍砲轟虹口之結果、或將變更策略、日軍將取切實之步驟對付之、此項步驟、非必須為報復者、刻正在考慮中云、譯者按、日人在虹口設砲位以轟擊我軍、而對我軍向虹口轟擊、竟表示反對、此種橫理、僅有日人厚顔說得出、</p>
<p>我軍重砲、於前晚猛轟敵艦及虹口楊樹浦敵軍陣地、標目凖確、予敵重創、敵為報復計、於昨晨八時左右、卽派機三架、至浦東我陣地上空低飛窺察、同時浦中敵艦、卽齊向浦東猛烈砲擊、一時隆隆之聲、震驚遐邇、我為避免敵機襲擊計、悉置不理、敵機毫無所獲、又因天雨、始悻悻而去、而浦中敵艦、雖於昨日午前尚不時向我浦東作漫無標的之轟擊、下午四時許、我軍大砲又施神威、浦中敵艦又倉皇還擊、五時許雨止、敵機六架分為二隊、又至浦東活動、我方卽暫停發砲、敵機無奈、遂在我瀾泥渡·楊家渡·塘橋等處、光後擲彈二十餘枚、毀我民房多間、敵機躊躇滿志、於暮色蒼茫中飛去、下午六時三十五分、浦江敵艦又向我浦東方面作無聊之轟襲、至七時二十分止、共發五十餘砲、以我方置之不理、乃自行停止、</p>
<p>不惜違背國際公法敵竟施用毒瓦斯彈</p>
<p>中央社云、敵軍日進犯羅店西北、及施相公有時近我軍陣地、經我奮勇擊退、敵以被創過重、竟不惜背棄國際公法、屢次施用毒瓦斯彈、甚殘虐狠毒之本性、已暴露無遺、據我軍部發言人負責發表、敵於五日在北周宅所用之噴嚏瓦斯、經醫學及化學家之化驗報告、含有毒性、故受毒之五十人、中有二十人診斷結果、確有中毒徵象、二十人已因不及救治而死、尚有六人中毒甚深、已無生望、其餘數人刻尚未淸醒、可見敵所用瓦斯毒性之烈、六日敵又在羅店西南施用毒氣、致我軍二十餘人中毒甚重、</p>
<p>倫敦七日哈瓦斯電、中國大使館頃發表公報稱“本月四日晚間、當日本軍隊向上海附近羅店鎭進攻時、中國軍隊沉着抵抗、極為猛烈、日軍乃使用毒瓦斯、以致中國士兵死傷多名、此事頃已證明確鑿有據”云、</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>抗戰到底</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>在國聯採取着譴責侵略國的步驟的同時。美國羅斯福總統發表了驚人的偉大的演說。接着美國務部宣布日本爲侵略國。於是世界輿論也熱烈地響應了。這一種有利的國際形勢的開展。顯然是我全國壯烈的抗戰精神的成果。同時也可以使我們的抗戰精神愈益發旺起來。</p>
<p>我中國‘有着無限的抵抗能力。’更得着國際有力的聲援。抗戰的勝利是可以確保的。唯一的問題就在我全國同胞能不能抗戰到底。</p>
<p>蔣委員長最近就羅斯福總統的演說。發表了一篇感想。其中說。‘我人現正奮鬥。並將繼續奮鬥。以期達到日本軍隊完全撤退之目的。俾吾人可繼續和平建設之計劃。吾人自衛之决心始終一致。雖戰至戰士之最後一人。領土之最後一寸。亦不稍變更初志。非俟正義確立。條約重伸其尊嚴。吾人之抵抗决不停止’。</p>
<p>這番有力的談話又復向世界昭示着。我全國同胞是抱有抗戰到底的决心的。國際間一切要使中國走屈辱的妥協途徑的企圖。從此該可以澈底消滅了罷。</p>

<h3>瑣評</h3>
<p>— 相</p>
<p>今日是十月九日。是雙十節國慶的前一日。本來在今日。應該興高彩烈地來預備慶祝。但是今年為暴日所侵略。正在堅决抗戰時期。姑且把慶祝的事。暫擱一擱。我們且拿預備國慶的精神。拿來抗敵。預備慶祝的金錢。拿來抗敵。</p>
<p>國慶猶人之生日。今年二十六歲。尚非正生日。並且在此非常時期。我們自然應當簡單一些。經濟一些。我們應當用臥薪嘗膽的態度。枕戈待且的精神。拚命地先把敵人驅而出諸我國國防綫以外。明年再來做一個很榮譽的很莊嚴的慶祝。亦是未晚。</p>

<h3>日銀行退職華員登記機關訪問記</h3>
<p>身受日人壓迫抗敵情緒更堅强　現在還受僱於敵誰不覺得難忍</p>
<p>（本報特寫）七月八日蘆溝橋事件發生以後，在上海的日商銀行朝鮮·台灣·正金·三菱·三井·住友·及各大辦業公司，各大紗廠的我國籍職員，都紛紛辭職，以示他們抗敵的决心·據八月四日的報章記載，“已有二百六十餘人，其中尤以幹部人才爲多·而淞滬抗戰發生之後，可以說得在所有日商銀行·公司·廠家的華籍職員，已經全部自動辭職了：這數目雖然沒有統計過，想起來决不在少數，那末，這些失業者現在如何生活着呢？這是我們值得注意的事。</p>
<p>關於各紗廠的失業工友，及各日商洋行的退職職員，都分別由各正式機關辦理登記手續。現在，日銀行的退職華員，也由“滬銀錢業聯誼會”在霞飛路五四二弄五號（巴黎大戲院東隔壁）該會辦理登記手續了。記者爲要知道一點較詳細的情形，昨天特地去訪問了一次。</p>
<p>據該會辦事人邵·韓兩位先生吿訴我，爲了“同人之誼”，及此次抗戰的前途，辦理登記日銀行退職華員他們是義不容辭的，不過因爲其他關係，所以延遲到了現在·至於這些退職華員的善後問題，在登記統計結束之後，暫時成立一個互助切磋會之類的組織（名義未定），由他們共同討論一切戰時經濟問題·因爲他們都親身受過日人的壓迫，抗敵情緒一定很高，意志也一定很堅强；而且內中很多幹部人員”，他們可以多知道一點日本在滬的經濟狀况·然後設法介紹職業—這問題果然太困難，不過他們將努力做去。</p>
<p>登記表上除了姓名，籍貫，年齡，通訊處之外，還分下列兩項：㊀原服務銀行名稱，原服務銀行地址，現在有無職業，何時空閒；㊁有何特殊技能，願担任何種工作，希望本會如何帮助，對原服務銀行感想，對此次抗戰感想等。記者去的時候，剛遇到二位日銀行退職華員在那裏塡寫登記表，他們是日本某銀行的練習生，就與他們作一次簡單的談話。</p>
<p>據他們二位吿訴我：自滬戰發生以來，三菱與三井的華員，已全部退出了，正金，台灣，朝鮮，住友雖然還照常營業，華人辦事員却祇有十之一二，他們都是爲了生活問題，陷在進退維谷之中，這境遇値得我們憐憫與同情的，所以一辦理登記一是刻不容緩，即使不能即刻介紹職業，在長期抗戰的時候，我們是處處需要人才的，以身受日人壓迫的同胞來做抗敵工作，他們的努力是可知的，而且我可以確定地說，他們—每一個人都願意爲國家盡最後之一份力的。現在，這些未退職的同胞，甚至都寄宿在銀行里，由此可知，他們的家或許已經毀於砲火，而無處容身；或許自己覺得慚愧，到現在還受僱於敵人，而不願拋頭露面，但是，他們能夠這樣忍受下去嗎？我們的回答是：“絕對不能的！”而我們也誠懇地等待着他們來靈爲國民的大職！</p>
<p>此次日本在滬的侵略經費，多數由日商銀行接洽支付，以上海幣制計算，匯劃於花旗及匯豐銀行。特務支出絕對守秘密，華籍職員當然無法知道。正金銀行的日人。有的已被召回國，參加金澤師團支隊來滬作戰。這幾位與我們同酷愛和平的日本人民，當他們在戰塲上以生命相搏的時候不知他們作何感想？</p>
<p>最後他還吿訴記者有四個日重要軍人住在某行的樓上，華籍職員當然也是絕對不能上去的。</p>
<p>在前綫將士效命於疆塲的時候，後方民衆都能積極地表示抗敵的决心，這種軍民合作的精神，最後的勝利不久會有事實來證明的。（蘋）</p>

<h3>民衆應注意的四點</h3>
<p>— 亞廬</p>
<p>我們惟有在抗戰中以求生存，這是誰都應知道的。上海之戰，敵軍不但在戰略上佔不到便宜，反遭我軍予以重大的創傷。我們由此更加堅信，惟有長期奮鬥，纔能博得最後勝利。所有以前的希冀，依賴，畏葸，恐日等不健全的心理，都應根本剷除。我們民衆雖還不需要到疆塲殺敵，但是際此非常時期，在後方的民衆，也應過着像軍隊裏有紀律的生活，就各自本位努力，爲國家𧗊一分力量。我認爲最低限度，要實行下列四端：</p>
<p>㊀節儉：在平常時候，大家祇知消耗，沒有新生產的智能，因此社會奢侈成爲萬方一概的風氣，言之實堪痛心。現在國家正在抗敵，國人當能有所驚覺了，况且軍需糧秣以及其他應用物質，在抗戰上都很重要，我們民衆應當節衣縮食，將其餘資援助國家，以增加殺敵的效果，這是民衆應有的救國精神。</p>
<p>㊁勤勞：古語云：“民生有勤，勤則不匱。”在這長期奮鬥之中，農工直接生產，固應加緊工作，使產量增加，必要的需求，源源不絕。就是其他間接生產的各種職業，也應奮發精神，勤勉服務。至於已經失業的人，速設法往內地找尋機緣，無論做工服農，都有發展的餘地，尤其希望團體機關給予他們種種便利和援助。如此則人人都能得勤勞機會，對於經濟機構，一定非常堅固。</p>
<p>㊂忍耐：要求民族生存，必須經過相當犧牲，現在衛國的兵士旣已舍身疆塲，那末我們民衆受些精神上的痛苦，物質上的損失，也應該忍耐。要知道物質的損失，將來還可以補償的，如果做了敵人的奴隸，那就永世不得翻身了。所以我們在戰時，都應咬緊牙關，極端忍耐，以博取民族的生存與未來的幸福。</p>
<p>㊃協助：語云：“衆擎易擧”，大的事非一人所能成功，必定要大家恊力同心而後有濟。前錢抗敵守士，固然是軍士的天職，但是後方接濟，那是我們民衆應𧗊的義務。因爲軍民能夠彼此合作，𦆵可以壯士氣而固軍心·至於救濟難民，開發農工等等工作，凡是有利於抗敵上的，都應羣起發揮恊助的精神。</p>
<p>上述四點，雖則是老生常談，但是我覺得在抗敵上却很重耍，因此不避卑陋，希望大家切實去做，給國家以無限的前程。啟事競明，永建，義祥諸位先生：請示通訊處，寄天津路一七八號上海巿童子軍戰事服務團宣傳處編輯股，以便通信。</p>

<h3>Chiang Kai-shek Expresses Support for U.S. President's Stern Position</h3>
<p>Our Soldiers Will Not Stop Until Justice is Established. Foreign Minister Wang Expresses Similar Sentiments and Thanks to Friendly Nations. He Hopes Powerful Nations Will Take Active Measures to Uphold Law and Morality.</p>
<p>[Nanjing] An Associated Press reporter yesterday visited Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, inquiring about his feelings regarding President Roosevelt's speech. Chairman Chiang issued the following statement: "The U.S. President has issued a famous statement advocating the respect for human rights and the sanctity of treaties. This not only moves the people of China, who have endured great hardship, but also excites those powerful nations who have always advocated for lasting peace built upon international morality. When the September 18th Incident occurred, the international community failed to cooperate in upholding treaty obligations, causing the world to suffer all sorts of serious consequences. Now, Japan once again disregards everything and repeats its aggression throughout China, directly believing that it is above any treaty or international law. Japan believes that all countries should obey its command regarding any issue in East Asia. For years, China has been moving towards unification, striving for peaceful construction, but Japan wants to destroy it with one cold blow. Japan does not allow any country to question or comment on its actions and plans, as if it considers itself the supreme legal authority in the world. Japan's aim is nothing more than to impoverish and weaken the Chinese people, eliminating their purchasing power completely, disregarding that China's purchasing power is an essential element in promoting international commerce. It not only wants to seize our nation's livelihood and monopolize the Chinese market but also wants to dominate the entire Pacific region. If this conquest of China is a delusion that China cannot overcome on its own, and other relevant countries cannot legally stop it, then China's great market will surely fall, and there will never be peace in the Pacific situation. Fortunately, today's news is that the U.S. State Department and the League of Nations General Assembly have both taken steps to condemn Japan as an aggressor, which deeply moves the Chinese people. We are now fighting to achieve the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops so that we can continue our peaceful construction plan. Our determination to defend ourselves is consistent from beginning to end. Even if it comes to the last soldier and the last inch of territory, we will not change our original intention. We will not stop resisting until justice is established and treaties regain their dignity. If countries that signed relevant treaties continue to allow international justice and law to be trampled upon, allowing Japan to continue its brutal aggression, it is tantamount to supporting its poisonous plot to defeat and destroy us. Now, the U.S. President has issued his great statement, clarifying human rights and peace, which makes us believe that those who uphold justice will surely get their wishes." (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui met with reporters on the 8th and issued the following statement: "China's current resistance is purely to maintain justice and humanity. In recent days, many facts have been gratifying, that all peace-loving countries in the world have risen up together and gathered under this clear banner with China. Civil society groups around the world have passed numerous resolutions expressing their deep sympathy to the Chinese people, and major politicians and leaders from all walks of life in various countries have condemned Japan's aggression against China, especially its killing of Chinese civilians, in Geneva and elsewhere. I, on behalf of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, express my sincere gratitude to these groups or individuals for all the moral and spiritual assistance they have given us during this national crisis. The Chinese government and the people have always firmly believed that truth and justice will ultimately prevail over might. Although the recent resolutions passed by the League of Nations General Assembly regarding the Sino-Japanese incident, and the first and second reports, are still somewhat lacking compared to the actions that China hoped the League of Nations could take in accordance with the Covenant, they are sufficient to clearly show that the entire civilized world is at least spiritually sympathetic and willing to support China in its resistance to aggression. This report has also established an important fact: that Japan's actions this time are a destruction of its treaty obligations, especially its obligations under the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and are absolutely indefensible. What is now hoped for is a swift and active measure to halt Japan's arbitrary destruction of international treaties and the fundamental principles of justice and humanity. Regarding the incident of Japan's aggression against China, the U.S. State Department has now reached the same conclusion as the League of Nations. The statement issued by the U.S. State Department on the 6th stated that Japan's actions are inconsistent with the principles of regulating international relations and violate the provisions of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Moreover, President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago a few days ago has won the sincere support of all peace-loving countries. The principles stated by Roosevelt can be said to be timely and sufficient to serve as the basis for the United States and the League of Nations to jointly work to contain international aggression. Although Roosevelt's speech did not explicitly mention the Sino-Japanese conflict, there is no doubt that the peace crisis he pointed out already exists in the current Far Eastern situation. Roosevelt reiterated that no country should hope to escape the terrible consequences of international chaos through isolation or neutrality, which is an accurate and unchanging argument. Only when all peace-loving countries understand this principle and work together to reverse the trend can international morality be prevented from being completely destroyed. Now, the unanimous opinion of the world inside and outside the League of Nations has recognized that important peace treaties in the Far East have been destroyed. The current question facing the civilized world is how to restore the dignity of international treaties and save the world from returning to the great chaos of the past. From the Far Eastern Incident in 1931 to Japan's large-scale invasion of China, the facts have proven that merely stating morality and passing resolutions are not enough to restrain Japan, which is controlled by warlords and despises public opinion. If the Far East is to be restored to peace, peace-loving countries must take active measures to uphold the dignity of law and morality. President Roosevelt said, 'All nations who wish to live in peace under international moral standards can and should find a way to make their aspirations prevail over the evil forces of disorder and lawlessness.' I fully agree." (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Statement on Attending Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Returns to Washington, D.C., Calls Cabinet Meeting. Davis Summoned to Washington.</p>
<p>[Washington] Secretary of State Hull recently made a statement to the press, saying that the State Department has not yet received an invitation to the conference of the signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty, but he intends to accept participation once the invitation arrives. When asked whether the State Department's public condemnation of Japan yesterday would be sufficient to trigger the implementation of the Neutrality Act, Hull replied that the public statement was purely based on the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact. As for whether the nine countries of South America agree, the State Department did not consult with those countries before issuing the public statement because the United States made this decision alone as a signatory of the Nine-Power Treaty. When asked if the rumor that the Nine-Power Treaty conference would be held in Washington was accurate, Hull did not express an opinion. He also declined to comment on former Secretary of State Stimson's suggestion that the United States and Britain should jointly boycott Japan. (Havas, Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[Washington] President Roosevelt returned to Washington D.C. this morning and convened a cabinet meeting in the afternoon to discuss issues such as international cooperation to prevent war and convening a special session of Congress. The President arrived in Washington D.C. at 8:30 this morning after touring the northwestern states, and many government officials welcomed him at the station. (National News, 8th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Prominent American political figure Davis, who has repeatedly served as a special envoy for the United States and attended major European conferences, has been urgently summoned from New York to Washington and arrived this morning. He will discuss with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull the U.S.'s participation in the Nine-Power Treaty conference. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[New York] According to the New York Times, if the Nine-Power Treaty conference is held in London, the U.S. government will likely send Special Envoy Davis to attend. Davis is a friend of President Roosevelt. Whenever there are major diplomatic issues, Davis represents the U.S. government in Europe, and is therefore known as the "Special Envoy to Europe." (Havas, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] The location of the Nine-Power Treaty conference has not yet been decided. Procedures for holding the meeting are currently being actively discussed through diplomatic channels. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Germany Also Not Participating in Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Although German political figures refused to comment on the U.S. State Department's public statement yesterday, they all acknowledged that it was a startling move. They said that Germany has significant economic interests in the Far East and will naturally pay close attention to the development of the situation. Germany is not a signatory of the Nine-Power Treaty in Washington and will not participate in the arbitration of the Sino-Japanese dispute. (Havas, Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador Saito Visits Hull</h3>
<p>British Ambassador Visits Japanese Vice Minister</p>
<p>[Washington] Japanese Ambassador to the U.S. Hiroshi Saito visited Secretary of State Hull today, reportedly for the purpose of exchanging information. Afterwards, Saito said that he did not raise any protests regarding the League of Nations' criticism of Japan's actions in China. However, he voluntarily visited Hull to explain certain information. He did not believe that the State Department's declaration would strain U.S.-Japan relations. He believed that the recent progress in the Far East conflict could clear the air and promote a better understanding between the two countries. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Clive visited Vice Foreign Minister Horiuchi at the Foreign Ministry today for a long discussion. Although no official statement was issued, it is widely believed that the content of the meeting was related to inviting Japan to participate in the Nine-Power Treaty conference. (National Maritime News, 7th)</p>
<h3>Hirota Has Audience with Emperor, Reports on International Situation</h3>
<p>Cabinet and Privy Council Both Hold Meetings. Will Issue Declaration Responding to U.S. Attitude</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Cabinet held a meeting today to discuss the international situation. Foreign Minister Hirota met with the Emperor to report on the attitudes of various countries towards the Sino-Japanese conflict. Prime Minister Konoe also entered the palace shortly after to report on general affairs to the Emperor. Soon after, the Privy Council also held a meeting for a long discussion. The Minister of Finance discussed the issue of issuing public bonds again with the President and Vice Presidents of the Bank of Japan. (National News, 8th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] A spokesman for the Japanese Foreign Ministry met with foreign reporters this afternoon, saying that the Japanese government has decided to issue a statement that can be made public on the 8th. When asked whether it was issued in response to the U.S. statement and the League of Nations resolution, the spokesman avoided answering. When asked whether the rumor that Japan would abandon the Nine-Power Treaty was true, he also did not answer. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] This morning, all newspapers published articles opposing the U.S. State Department's statement. The Asahi Shimbun said that Roosevelt's speech and Hull's statement seemed aimed at providing spiritual support to the League of Nations and could be used to justify the safety of some domestic opinions and actions. The United States has always had a correct understanding of the Far East, and its past actions show that it is seeking to end the current war urgently but without investigating the cause. Trying to resolve the situation without sufficient understanding will only increase disputes. The actions of various countries only fuel China's fighting spirit. The League of Nations invites a situation contrary to its purpose, which must be noted. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun expressed surprise and regret over the U.S. attitude and further argued that the Kellogg-Briand Pact does not deny any war, so it does not prohibit self-defense wars or punitive wars. The United States and other countries only see the surface or are misled by superficiality and take rash actions. Even if the motives are good, they will greatly harm world peace and the maintenance of justice. The Miyako Shimbun said that Japan will stand in a state of siege and must be aware of future difficulties and not retreat a step. The Yomiuri Shimbun said that the League of Nations and the United States want to accuse Japan of violating the treaty and convene a meeting, which will naturally not be accepted. The Pacific Conference is nothing more than two methods: one is limited to moral sanctions, and the other is to implement an economic blockade through the League of Nations. The United States has a decisive dominance in the meeting and must be paid attention to. The other newspapers are largely the same. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Abandon Nine-Power Treaty</h3>
<p>Japanese Securities Plummet</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The Japanese Cabinet met today to discuss the changes caused by the League of Nations and the U.S. government issuing declarations on the Sino-Japanese conflict. It is rumored that Japan plans to declare the Nine-Power Treaty, which guarantees the political and territorial integrity of China, abolished. Some say that the declaration of abandonment of the treaty has reached an inevitable point. At present, the Japanese stock market is panicking greatly due to the U.S. State Department's declaration condemning Japan's atrocities, and most securities have seen a drastic decline. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Will Implement Military Expansion</h3>
<p>British Government Greatly Welcomes</p>
<p>[New York] Regarding President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago denouncing Japanese aggression, The New York Times stated today that the American financial community deeply feels that the United States will implement a broad military buildup program in the future. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] There is great attention here to the news of the U.S. government's large-scale military expansion. It is reported that the cost of this military expansion plan will reach $2,000,000,000. The Daily Mail states that all of Britain welcomes the United States' strengthening of its military because its purpose is exactly the same as Britain's military expansion, which is to safeguard world peace. The report also states that this move will have a significant impact on political and economic development. (National Maritime News, 8th)</p>
<h3>German Authorities Deny Supplying Military Equipment to Japan</h3>
<p>[Berlin] Rumors have spread that Germany has already or will conclude a contract to sell military equipment worth 40 million Swiss francs to Japan. Responsible authorities here have sternly refuted this rumor, stating that they have not signed any military equipment contract with Japan and that the above rumors are absolutely baseless. (National Maritime News, 8th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Officer Plans to Lead Volunteers</h3>
<p>To China to Join the War Against Japan</p>
<p>⊙Los Angeles U.S. Army Major General Hahn, a junior officer, declared that he will lead a troop to China in a private capacity to participate in the War of Resistance Against Japan. According to Hahn, he can gather 10,000 veterans and volunteers to participate in the war. The problem is transportation costs. He also said that if he cannot raise the funds within this month, he will temporarily suspend his plan to lead the entire army and will only go with a small number of volunteers at their own expense. In other words, he will start with 250 people, including 200 pilots, and the rest will be machine gunners and specialized technicians with combat experience. According to Hahn, placing this small, well-trained army in key positions in the Chinese army will demonstrate its power. After our people's abilities are recognized, the Chinese will definitely welcome us. At that time, all those who sympathize with China will have the opportunity to do more for China. (National News, 7th)</p>
<h3>British and American Labor Unions Contact Each Other to Boycott Japan</h3>
<p>Major U.S. Department Stores and Factories Have Begun to Stop Buying Japanese Goods</p>
<p>[New York] Three major U.S. groups today all endorsed a boycott of Japanese goods. American Federation of Labor President Green has suggested boycotting all Japanese goods in opposition to "Japan's desire to control China." The American Standards Protection Association, organized by major manufacturers, also announced its support for a permanent boycott of Japanese raw materials and finished products. At the same time, the Anti-War and Anti-Fascist Alliance announced that it has completed a plan to patrol retailers selling Japanese goods. (National News, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙Denver, USA It seems that the powerful U.S. labor union's movement to boycott Japanese goods will become a reality today. President Green of the union stated that he knows that the American Federation of Labor will be able to endorse Sir Walter Citrine's telegram from the leaders of the British Labor Party, requesting a joint boycott of Japanese goods to deal with Japan's barbaric behavior. (National News, 8th)</p>
<p>⊙Denver, USA American Federation of Labor President Green today submitted to the AFL's annual convention a request to endorse the British Labor Party's boycott of Japanese goods. Vice President Woll also called for a boycott of Japanese goods, saying that he is convinced that the American people do not want to indirectly help Japan carry out its brutal war of aggression. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>[New York] National department stores have now canceled orders worth millions of dollars for Japanese goods due to the enthusiastic anti-Japanese sentiment of the American people. There are now pickets monitoring stores selling Japanese goods. (National News, 8th)</p>
<p>[London] The civil society movement in Britain to boycott Japanese goods is underway in many areas. The Labor Party newspaper is now vigorously promoting it. Several cooperative societies have passed lectures opposing Japanese aggression and promoting a boycott, and many free churches in England and Wales have also taken the same action. The Daily Citizen today published in large letters a telegram from Ms. Soong Ching Ling, stating the situation of China's struggle for national survival and requesting that the great British Labor Party express its sympathy with concrete actions to stop Japan's arrogant destruction of civilization. However, the force of those advocating caution is also worth noting. For example, Councillor Roswell, Speaker of the Salford City Council, stated today that although the city expresses its sympathy for China, the boycott is a dangerous tool and easily becomes an explosive. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>⊙Victoria, Canada The Victoria Trades and Labor Council executive committee today passed a resolution endorsing a boycott of goods from Japan, Germany, and Italy. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Government Statement Original Text</h3>
<p>Recognizes Japan's Violation of Treaties</p>
<p>⊙Nanjing On the evening of October 6, 1937, the U.S. State Department issued the following statement to the press: The League of Nations Advisory Committee stated that the committee's report on the current situation in China and Japan's treaty obligations has been passed by the committee. The original text has been reported to the U.S. State Department by the U.S. Minister to Switzerland. According to the Minister, the report was adopted by the League of Nations General Assembly on the 6th of this month. Since the beginning of this conflict in the Far East, the U.S. government has taught and persuaded the governments of China and Japan to curb hostile actions, and proposed to assist both sides in finding a mutually acceptable peaceful solution to the Far Eastern situation. On July 16 and August 23, the U.S. Secretary of State publicly elaborated on the U.S. government's attitude towards international issues and international relations. This attitude is applicable to the whole world, and it is especially applicable to the current unwelcomed hostile actions between China and Japan. The U.S. government believes that the principles necessary for maintaining peace in handling international relations are: all countries should avoid using force to conduct their national policies, and avoid interfering in the internal affairs of other countries; apply peaceful negotiations and consultation procedures; adjust international issues; mutually respect the rights of other countries; and abide by the defined obligations; and maintain the principle of the sanctity of treaties. On October 5, the U.S. President further detailed these principles in Chicago, emphasizing their importance, and when discussing the international situation, he pointed out that without observing the moral principles of law and covenants, there will be no stability or peace, whether domestically or internationally. The state of international chaos will destroy all foundations of peace, and this situation will inevitably endanger the current or future security of all countries, large and small. Therefore, the American people believe that it is extremely important and concerning to restore the dignity of treaties and international morality. In terms of the development of the situation in the Far East, the U.S. government has been forced by the facts to state that Japan's actions in China are not in line with the principles that should be used to handle international systems and violate the Nine-Power Treaty of February 6, 1913, which was signed to handle the principles and policies that should be observed in handling Chinese events, and the provisions of the Kellogg-Briand Pact signed on August 27, 1928. The government's continued arguments regarding the aforementioned matters are generally in line with the conclusions of the League of Nations General Assembly. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Italy Sends More Reinforcements to North Africa</h3>
<p>Also Recruits New Soldiers</p>
<p>⊙Naples Another 2,000 Italian soldiers will be sent to Tripoli to strengthen the defense of Libya. This is the fourth reinforcement in three weeks, bringing the total number of Libyan defense forces to over 16,000. (Reuters, Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<p>⊙Rome Regarding the rumors that new recruits from the 1907, 1908, and 1909 classes in Italy will be drafted into the army, responsible sources had previously denied them and now reiterated that only new recruits from the 1909 class in a certain district will be drafted, and only those who are interested in specialized technology will be drafted. This is to encourage the enthusiasm of these skilled talents. (Havas, Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>⊙Rome The autumn session of the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party, originally scheduled to begin tonight, has been postponed indefinitely. Responsible sources in Italy stated that the reason for the postponement is purely "technical." (Havas, Central News Agency, 7th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Responds to U.S. President</h3>
<p>Soviet Foreign Committee Newspaper Expresses Approval; French Parliamentary Speaker Herriot Condemns Japanese Atrocities</p>
<p>[London] British Foreign Secretary Eden received U.S. Chargé d'affaires Johnson today, stating that the British government deeply agrees with President Roosevelt's foreign policy speech in Chicago, considering it a genuine contribution to peace. (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>[London] British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Plymouth, spoke today at the Scarborough Conservative Party Congress, expressing deep dissatisfaction with the large number of civilians who have died in the Far East. He stated that when the Conservative Party holds a public meeting on Friday, British Prime Minister Chamberlain will speak in detail about the Far Eastern situation. (7th Central News Agency Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet Russian Foreign Committee expressed sincere welcome to President Roosevelt's speech in Chicago, but stated that if one wishes to stop Japan's aggression against China, it is necessary to take resolute collective action. According to the Communist Party's organ, "Pravda," today's publication stated that the United States' new attitude towards the Far East conflict shows that Japanese aggression has reached the point of disrupting world opinion. The continuous attacks by aggressors have made it impossible for countries to continue to embrace the so-called "non-interference policy," and they must take effective collective measures against the instigators of this "new world war." The newspaper believes that if all peace-loving countries truly unite, then stopping the instigators of war will not be a problem at all. (8th National Maritime Telegraph)</p>
<p>[Moscow] The Soviet government and the Communist Party organ today unanimously published commentaries supporting U.S. President Roosevelt's foreign policy declaration, and stating that Soviet Russia is willing to fully support collective action to deal with aggression. Pravda and Izvestia praised President Roosevelt for being able to warn the American people with complete truth, which is truly commendable. Pravda also stated, "The faces of the aggressor countries may seem fierce, but in reality, they are not that frightening. If peace-loving countries can approach them with joint action, they will surely be able to stop the spread of war." (8th National Telegram)</p>
<p>⊙Lyon The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies and Mayor of this city, Herriot, gave a speech here yesterday, roughly stating, "China has now become the target of large-scale aggression, and the massacre of civilians, women, and children occurs constantly. Such violent behavior should not be tolerated. Those who are driven by conscience to protest are ridiculed by shameless people, which we also cannot tolerate. The principles on which human progress should be based have never been destroyed so frequently and violently as they are today. The barbaric act of indiscriminate killing has already become apparent today. There is no distinction made between undefended cities and fortified cities, and civilians and combatants are bombed indiscriminately. Our great French Republic should protest against such dishonorable atrocities. Fortunately, the results of the last few meetings of the League of Nations have given us considerable hope. The Nine-Power Treaty to guarantee China's territorial integrity has also been invoked by the United States. President Roosevelt's denunciation of the terror the world is encountering and the unjustified interference of certain countries in the internal affairs of other countries is satisfactory. The current issue is which is superior, the collective will of a free nation or the private intention of a dictator, and a judgment must be made." (8th Central News Agency Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>Full Text of U.S. President Roosevelt's Foreign Policy Speech</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Diplomatic circles say that U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a speech at the dedication ceremony of the bridge built in Chicago on October 5. The full text is as follows: I am now here in Chicago and have the opportunity to participate in the dedication ceremony of this important municipal construction, which I find very pleasing. As I traversed the country, I have seen the various results of cooperation between local governments and the central government based on common sense, and from the welcoming sounds and expressions of millions of people, I can see that they have made significant progress in both material and spiritual aspects in recent years. However, when I see the prosperity of our country's rural areas, the prosperity of factories, the development of railways, and our country's happiness, safety, and peace, I cannot help but compare it with other parts of the world, and I find the scenery quite different. It is necessary to know that the American people, under modern conditions, must look beyond the United States for their own future. In my capacity as a responsible representative of this country, I would like to take this opportunity in Chicago, a large inland metropolis, and on this auspicious occasion of the dedication ceremony, to speak to you about a matter of great importance to the country. The recent world political situation has become increasingly dangerous, causing all peace-loving people and countries to feel extremely concerned. Ten years ago, more than sixty countries solemnly pledged not to use force as an instrument of national policy, and humanity's hope for permanent international peace reached its peak. However, this expression, in the noble spirit of the Non-Aggression Pact and the desire for peace, has recently been destroyed by the idea that a great disaster is imminent. The current state of terror and international disregard for the law is but the beginning of a few years ago. At first, it was illegal interference in the internal affairs of other countries, or violations of treaties and aggression against other countries' territories, which has become increasingly serious today, and will seriously threaten the foundations of civilization. All signs and heritages of civilization's evolution toward legal order and public reason have been swept away. Without declaring war, or warning, or reason, many innocent civilians, women, and children have been brutally bombed and killed by the air force. In a so-called state of peace, without reason or notice, numerous ships are being arbitrarily sunk by submarines. Other countries, though not harming us, are inciting and fostering internal strife. While not allowing other countries to interfere in their own internal affairs, they are interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Innocent people and countries are now being brutally sacrificed by those vying for hegemony, who have absolutely no sense of justice or humanity. Recently, a writer said, "We can foresee that if humans are happy to kill, they will run rampant throughout the world, destroying all culture, art, and all the treasures that have survived for thousands of years. The weak, the small, and the defenseless will be wiped out without a trace." If such a situation occurs elsewhere, do not think that the United States can be safe, do not think that the United States can be forgiven, do not think that the Western Hemisphere will not be attacked, do not think that the Western Hemisphere can continue to develop the morals and arts of civilization in a state of peace. If this unfortunate day comes, then force will be unreliable, authority will be useless, science will lose its effect, until all the flowers of culture are trampled upon, and all mankind will fall into a great state of chaos. If we want to avoid the advent of this unfortunate day, if we want to live and work in peace, freedom, and without worry in the world, then all peace-loving countries should rise up and cooperate to maintain the laws and principles that are the foundation of peace. All peace-loving countries should rise up and cooperate to oppose acts that violate treaties and humanity, as such violations of treaties and humanity cause international chaos and instability. It is not possible to avoid the waves of this chaos and instability by strictly adhering to isolation and neutrality. Those who embrace freedom and recognize and respect the equal rights of their neighbors to live in peace must work together to ensure that law and moral principles prevail, and that peace, justice, and trust flourish in the world. In short, it is necessary to trust promises, to trust the value of signed treaties, and to recognize that national morality and private morality are equally important. A certain bishop recently wrote to me, saying, "We should protest on behalf of humanity against the terror of war being inflicted on innocent civilians, especially on infants. The so-called realists may say that this kind of resistance is of no practical use, but in fact, the human spirit is agitated by the current senseless sacrifices and will surely concentrate great power to reduce future cruelty. Even if this collective protest against barbarism takes twenty years to be truly effective, there is no doubt that strong public opinion can accelerate the arrival of this day." Today, the world's technology and morality are intertwined and interdependent. It is impossible for any country to completely isolate itself from economic and political trends, especially when such trends are expanding day by day. If treaties and moral standards are not universally observed by all countries, then neither international peace nor national peace can be stable. International anarchy is sufficient to destroy all foundations of peace and endanger the present or future security of all countries, whether strong or weak. Therefore, restoring the dignity of international treaties and maintaining international morality are matters of great importance and relevance to the American people. Today, the vast majority of people and countries in the world hope to live in a peaceful world. They all hope to eliminate the forces that oppress them. They would rather work hard to produce profitable goods for industry, agriculture, and commerce to increase wealth, and are unwilling to manufacture military aircraft, bombs, machine guns, and cannons to destroy human life and useful property. Countries that are enriching their military purchases in an attempt to engage in aggression, as well as countries that fear foreign aggression and undermine their own security, are now directly wasting a large portion of their national income on armaments, with proportions reaching 30% to 50% of their national income. As for the United States, the annual expenditure on armaments is lower than this, only 11% to 12%. Our current environment allows us to spend money on bridges and highways, on sluices and forest transformation, on soil conservation, and other useful projects, instead of on huge standing armies and war instruments. We are very happy, but I cannot help but feel deeply worried about the future. The peace, freedom, and security of 90% of the world's population are now threatened by the remaining 10% who disrupt the international order and international law. However, these 90% who wish to live in peace according to the law and universally accepted moral principles can find a way, and must find a way to realize their wishes. The situation today is undoubtedly related to the whole world. The issue is not just about a certain provision of a certain treaty being violated, but about the issue of war and peace, the issue of international law, and especially the issue of humanitarian principles. It is indeed a violation of treaties, especially the Covenant of the League of Nations, the Non-Aggression Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty, but it is also related to the world economy, world security, and world human problems. The world's moral consciousness must recognize its right to seek a solution for imbalances and well-founded grievances, but at the same time, it should recognize the supreme necessity of respecting the dignity of treaties, valuing the rights and freedoms of other countries, and preventing international aggression. Disregard for the law is like an epidemic, spreading throughout the world without end. Unfortunately, when an epidemic is on the rise, members of society know to approve of isolating patients to protect public health from infection. I am determined to focus on a policy of peace and take appropriate measures to avoid being drawn into the vortex of war. In the present world, and with past experience, it is an inconceivable act of folly that there are still countries that violate sacred treaties and invade other countries that have not actually harmed them and are not strong enough to defend themselves, thereby endangering the world by dragging it into war. However, the world's peace, the security and happiness of nations, are now threatened by this folly. A country that cannot restrain itself and does not respect the rights and freedoms of other countries will never be strong for long and will never gain the trust and respect of other countries. A country that handles disputes with a spirit of compromise and can patiently consider the rights of other countries will never lose its dignity or status as a result. War, whether declared or not, has the potential to spread, and even countries and people far from the original theater of war can be involved. Therefore, although we have decided to stay out of the war, we cannot guarantee that we will not be affected by the misfortunes of war, nor can we guarantee that we will not be drawn into the vortex of war. We are now taking necessary measures to reduce the risk of our involvement, but it is difficult for us to have sufficient guarantees in this chaotic world of broken trust and security. If civilization is to continue to exist, the Christian principles of peace must be restored, and the trust between nations that has been broken must be rebuilt. What is even more important is that the peaceful intentions of peace-loving countries must be clearly expressed, so that countries that attempt to violate existing treaties and the rights of other countries will change their behavior and maintain peace. Maintaining peace requires active efforts. The American people hate war and hope for peace, so they are now actively pursuing peace. (7th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Coming and Going in Bombing Raids</h3>
<p>— Guo Moruo</p>
<p>Mr. Guo Moruo returned to China on the eve of the outbreak of the Battle of Shanghai and was summoned to Nanjing by President Chiang last month on the 19th. This article is a record of Guo Guangsheng's journey between Nanjing and Shanghai during enemy air raids. As the first long article after his return to China, it vividly describes the atrocities of enemy air raids, the wartime capital Nanjing, the military and political authorities, the front lines of Shanghai, Suzhou, and the two elders Zhang (Yilin) and Li (Genyuan). From the various aspects described, we can also obtain full assurance of the future victory of our country's war of resistance. The publication rights have now been obtained by this newspaper and will begin to be published in this newspaper. We hope that those who are concerned about the war of resistance and those who love Mr. Guo's works will pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Complete Economic Severance with Japan</h3>
<p>— Wu Yugan</p>
<p>Our resistance to the brutal Japanese not only relies on military force, but also requires the full implementation of economic resistance. Therefore, in recent days, organizations such as the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce have been vigorously advocating economic severance with Japan, and at the same time, people around the world who sympathize with China have been actively advocating the boycott of Japanese goods. This shows that the power of economic resistance is great, no less than that of military force, and has already been recognized by the world.</p>
<p>However, it may be very difficult for people in various countries around the world to truly help us boycott Japanese goods. It should be understood that their declaration of boycotting Japanese loans is originally just to uphold justice and express righteous indignation; if it is truly implemented, they have many vital interests that they must first consider. Last year, didn't various countries in the world boycott Italian goods for Abyssinia and impose economic sanctions on Italy? What was the effect? It should be understood that before the international relations of various countries with Japan fundamentally change, it is very difficult to hope that their boycott of Japanese goods will be effective. Because under normal circumstances, upholding justice cannot overcome one's own economic interests. For example, Japan's important imports of cotton from the United States and India are around 400 million yuan each year. May I ask if they can sacrifice such a large export interest to boycott Japan's large imports of raw silk or cotton cloth? Also, Japan's wool almost entirely comes from Australia. May I ask if Australia can sacrifice its 200 million yuan a year wool business to boycott Japan's imports of cotton cloth and sundries? We only need to see that in the past few days when the League of Nations is meeting, when discussing economic sanctions against Japan, the representatives of the British Empire's colonies are somewhat evasive and dare not offend. It is also possible to imagine the future of international help for China to boycott Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Therefore, to truly boycott Japanese goods, we can only do it ourselves; and we must not only boycott Japanese goods, but also sever all economic relations with Japan in order to achieve the effect of economic resistance. It is very strange that since July 7, when the Lugouqiao Incident launched the war of resistance, it has been a full three months. Why haven't we simultaneously implemented economic resistance and severed all economic relations with Japan? Now, launching economic severance with Japan, in our long-term war of resistance, is not too late; but from now on, it must be thoroughly implemented, and not just treated as a mere formality, in order to have a great effect. We must understand that in the past two or three months, we have not been able to achieve economic severance with Japan. On the one hand, it is because in the areas occupied by Japanese military force, the power of import and export of goods is in their hands; they can use general traitors to help them promote everything and monopolize everything. Naturally, there will also be batches of unscrupulous merchants to collude with the enemy and traffic with them for profit; at the same time, perhaps some people use the restraint of contracts as an excuse, or for the sake of private feelings; so they have to temporarily maintain economic relations with Japan. But now, these things should not be allowed to exist anymore.</p>
<p>What is most important for us now, whether in the war zone or non-war zone, is to be strictly vigilant, use the method of clearing the fields and strengthening the walls, and pay close attention to the activities of traitors and the unintentional actions of ordinary people to aid the enemy. Anyone who sells enemy goods or sells loans to the enemy, or serves the enemy, or has any economic relations with the enemy, should be regarded by the government as colluding with the enemy and punished. Even those banks and stores established by our country in Japan should be closed down and returned to the country to cut off economic ties. Japan relies on our country's commercial and economic interests the most. We can only sever commercial and economic relations with her to give her a major blow. We believe that the current economic severance with Japan needs to achieve at least the following points:</p>
<p>㊀ The customs registers must not have import of Japanese goods and export figures to Japan in the future. If there are any, we should trace the source: who is colluding with the enemy, it is not difficult to find out the truth; even if foreign firms come forward to handle it, it is also possible to indirectly trace clearly to completely eradicate the source. If, like in August, during the Shanghai war, the import of Japanese goods at Jianghai Customs was still more than 7 million gold units, then our bloody war on the front lines would be a waste of effort.</p>
<p>㊁ Japanese goods that have already been imported into the interior should be sealed and not sold. Chambers of commerce and trade associations in various places should urgently implement this matter and must not allow unscrupulous merchants to sell the Japanese goods they have stored under any pretext. They should especially prevent them from disguising themselves and pretending to be goods from other countries, or even pretending to be domestic goods for sale. We know that before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, unscrupulous merchants in Shanghai had reported a large number of Japanese goods to be shipped to various ports downstream of the Yangtze River, so that the water freight of exported ships once reached more than 100,000 yuan, and the huge value of the Japanese goods being sold is even more conceivable. If old Japanese goods are prohibited from being sold, it can prevent unscrupulous merchants from continuing to import Japanese goods. This is also a necessary work for rectifying the source.</p>
<p>㊂ All those who serve in enemy public and private institutions, groups, industrial and commercial firms should withdraw: especially those who serve in enemy merchant ships and warships, whether sailors, stokers, or pilots, should quickly withdraw from the work that they are directly harming the motherland. Our seafarers' union has an unshirkable duty to contact seafarers all over the world to undertake and urge this work. Currently, in various war zones and non-war zones, there are still many people who serve the enemy or keep all kinds of property and equipment, or even have enemy passes to travel in enemy-occupied areas. If these people do not withdraw, they should also be treated as traitors and punished.</p>
<p>㊃ All public and private debts to Japan should be stopped or postponed immediately. A few days ago, while our government was fiercely resisting Japan, it still paid Japan's indemnity debt. This is naturally irreproachable in terms of our government's efforts to maintain credit, but this method of "feeding the bandits" is too dangerous for the future of the war of resistance. Some people suspect that if we do not pay, the enemy will plunder the customs of the occupied areas, and then all tax revenue will be lost. I hope that these speculations are not the truth. Because we are fighting for the reasons of justice, public morality, national survival, and we have already spared no sacrifice, do we still want to benefit from a little bit of tax revenue under enemy occupation? As long as we believe that stopping the payment of enemy debts can strengthen our war of resistance, we should do it without hesitation. This is also a concrete manifestation of the government's and the people's determination to resist Japan.</p>
<p>In short, economic severance must be thoroughly implemented to be effective. This does not entirely depend on the government. What is most important is to hope that chambers of commerce and trade associations in various places will strictly implement it. I am afraid that some unscrupulous merchants with strong financial resources can collude with the enemy or secretly entrust foreign merchants to seek profit and carry out treacherous plans. This requires the government and the people of the whole country to pay attention to and monitor them at any time and impose severe punishments. We hope that this great economic severance with Japan can achieve the greatest unprecedented effect, just like the military war of resistance!</p>
<h3>The Enemy Charges Guanyintang Positions, But is Encircled and Driven Back to Original Defenses</h3>
<p>Our Army Outflanks and Annihilates the Enemy Southeast of Guangfu Town; Enemy Attempts to Assault Hejiaxiang Yesterday, but Suffers Crushing Blow; Enemy Attempts Three-Pronged Sneak Crossing of Wenzaobang, But are Completely Annihilated</p>
<p>Central News Agency Correspondent with the Army, 8:30 PM Report: The defensive perimeter of our army near Guanyintang, south of Fudan University in Jiangwan, was breached by attacking enemy forces at 4:00 AM this morning. However, the enemy did not dare to penetrate deeply and was quickly encircled on three sides and attacked on their flanks and rear. After a brief but intense assault, they were repelled, and our original defenses were restored. At the Bajiao Bridge and Guangdong Street, both sides maintain their original positions under strict vigilance. Although there were several skirmishes between outposts, they quickly ceased. However, enemy artillery fire was intense, and several enemy aircraft continuously dropped bombs and strafed with machine guns, but there was no damage to our fortifications or troops. Furthermore, a report from 12:20 AM this morning stated that on the Jiangwan-Zhabei front, there were only a few outpost skirmishes from yesterday morning until evening, and enemy aircraft were active once in the late afternoon. However, sporadic artillery exchanges continued to be heard. At approximately 5:00 AM, two enemy companies, supported by seven tanks, advanced from the Sijing Golf Course towards our Hejiaxiang defensive perimeter near the Municipal Cemetery, launching a fierce assault. It seems the enemy intended to exploit a perceived weakness to break through, but our army had full deployments along the entire line, making their efforts futile. Upon seeing the enemy approach, our forces met them with a crushing blow. Our flat-trajectory guns unleashed their power, destroying one enemy tank and killing over thirty enemy soldiers. Seeing the unfavorable situation, the enemy formed a line and confronted us. At the time of the report, fierce fighting was still ongoing, with the sounds of gunfire and grenades filling the air. However, our positions remained steadfast.</p>
<p>Enemy Attack on Guangfu Town's Southeast Sector Repelled with Heavy Losses</p>
<p>The enemy forces in the Liuhang area have been continuously attacking our Guangfu Town's front and both flanks. After our forces intercepted and repelled them separately, the enemy at the front suffered especially heavy losses, so since the day before yesterday afternoon, the enemy has not dared to come again, instead switching to attacking our flanks, particularly the left flank, attempting to force our army to retreat and coordinate with forces on the southern bank of the Xing River to prevent us from attacking their flanks and rear. However, our army anticipated their plan and stationed significant forces there for careful defense, preventing the enemy from gaining even an inch. At dawn, over a thousand enemy troops advanced towards the Mengjiazhai and Laoluzhai areas southeast of Guangfu. Our army calmly responded, and the enemy ultimately failed to succeed. In the northeast, the enemy attacked Chenjiazhai at 3:00 AM yesterday. Our army bravely fought back, engaging in several close-quarters battles, ultimately repelling them. When the enemy retreated in disarray, they left behind four machine guns and many other military supplies, all of which we seized.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 8th Dispatch: In recent days, our army has been fiercely battling the enemy's 1st and 2nd Battalions of the Taiwan Infantry Regiment northwest of Luodian. Our army launched courageous assaults, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. Among the enemy corpses, we were able to identify the names of Captain Chinan, Lieutenant Yamaguchi, Lieutenants Nishihara and Arida, and Captain Nisuji, an engineer. Moreover, we found many documents and diaries on the corpses, which reveal a pessimistic outlook on the prospects of the operation. Their morale is evidently low.</p>
<p>Enemy Advances from Dongbaoxing Road but Suffers Heavy Casualties in Our Ambush</p>
<p>Central News Agency: Our correspondent with the army reported at 12:45 PM on the 8th that the enemy forces on North Sichuan Road launched another attack from Dongbaoxing Road on the evening of the 7th. Our forces rose up to intercept and kill them, engaging in fierce street fighting amid heavy rain. By 2:00 AM yesterday, the enemy had retreated in silence. In between, there were two unprecedented artillery duels. Our heavy artillery fire was accurately targeted, and the enemy, after suffering losses, realized that our forces there were well-prepared and there was no room to maneuver. Thus, they changed tactics and, at around 4:00 AM, advanced from the 63rd Garden and the Japanese Cemetery along the eastern bank of Yokohama. At that time, our forward scouts had already advanced past the Bajiao Bridge towards Liuying Road and encountered the enemy. The troops stationed at the Guangdong Middle School also launched an attack along the Shuidian Road and arrived at the same time, ambushing the enemy. At that time, the enemy's artillery units and tanks had been transferred to other locations, so their strength was weak and they were unusually cowardly. Our forces then bravely moved forward and engaged the enemy in close-quarters combat, fighting a bloody battle for three hours, annihilating over ninety enemy soldiers and returning victorious to our positions. As for the Jiangwan area, the day before yesterday and yesterday were both very quiet, as the enemy was focusing all its efforts on trying to break through our Dou Mountain Road and Bajiao Bridge positions and had no energy to attack there. Yesterday morning from 6:00 to 10:00 AM, artillery fire was heard between the two locations, but it was not very intense.</p>
<p>The Enemy Repeatedly Launches Fierce Assaults on Zhabei, But Makes No Progress; Moreover, That Area Consists Entirely of City Streets, Making it Difficult to Attack, So Since the 6th, the Enemy Has Employed New Weapons to Bombard with Artillery, with the Aim of Burning Down Civilian Houses and Threatening Our Army. The First Time the Enemy Employed These, Their Charging Infantry Was Repelled by Our Machine Guns, Rendering it Ineffective. The Enemy Forces Have Recently Repeatedly Employed New and Illegal Weapons, Indicating the Heavy Blows They Have Suffered and the Difficulties They Are Encountering in Their Operations in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Enemy Forces Attempt Sneak Crossings of Wenzaobang, But Are Completely Annihilated in Three-Pronged Encirclement</p>
<p>The Battles Along the Wenzaobang Riverfront, Which Had Abated Slightly the Previous Night (the 7th) Due to Heavy Rain, Fiercely Resumed and Continued Until This Morning. The Situations at the Three Locations are as Follows: ㊀ The Enemy, Who had Crossed the River from Dongyangzhai and Gathered at Yanzhai and Duzhai, Attacked Xuzhai the Previous Night, But Were Intercepted and Killed, With Most of Them Annihilated. This Morning, Their Remnants Were Trapped on the Riverbank, Unable to Advance or Retreat, Appearing Quite Wretched. ㊁ The Enemy Stationed at Zhangjiazhai Was Besieged by Our Army for a Long Time, and Ultimately Remained Trapped and Refused to Come Out. Our Army Then Deployed a Clever Plan, First Ambushing Troops Nearby, Then Feigning a Defeat and Retreat to Lure the Enemy to Pursue. Near Nijiayuan, the Ambushing Troops Rose Up on All Sides and Encircled the Enemy. Fierce Fighting Continued Until This Morning. ㊂ At Tangqiao, Jiangjiazhai, and Weiwan, the Enemy Was Building Bridges to Continuously Reinforce Their Forces. Our Army Saw Them Crossing Midway and Immediately Swept the Area with Machine Gun Fire from Left and Right. Enemy Soldiers Were Hit and Fell Into the Water. Approximately Two Hundred Were Drowned or Killed at That Time.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Correspondent with the Army, 8:30 PM Report: The Enemy Forces on the Northern Bank of the Wenzaobang River, Who Had Attempted a Sneak Crossing near Dongyangzhai the Day Before Yesterday, Numbered Only One or Two Hundred. Just as They Were Deploying Their Positions, They Were Suddenly Fiercely Attacked by Our Forces and Most Were Annihilated. This Morning at Dawn, We Launched Attacks from Yanjiawan and Zhangjiazhai, Finally Forcing the Remaining Enemy Troops to Flee. Many of the Enemy Troops Fell Into the Water in Their Hasty Retreat. A Small Number of Enemy Soldiers Were Salvaging Supplies on the Riverbank When We Swept Them with Machine Gun Fire, Leading to Another Fierce Battle. Near Jiangjiazhai, the Enemy Continued to Attempt Sneak Crossings. We Were Well-Prepared, and as Soon as Some Had Crossed, We Leapt Out and Charged, Striking Over Sixty Enemy Soldiers and Seizing One Light Machine Gun and Multiple Rifles. At That Time, There Were Also Four Small Boats that Had Already Crossed Midway. Our Army Pursued and Heavily Bombarded Them with Artillery and Grenades, Sinking Them. Many Enemy Soldiers Drowned.</p>
<p>Our Army's Heavy Artillery Inflicts Heavy Damage on the Enemy, Who Issues a Threat of Retaliation</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports: This morning (the 8th), a Japanese military spokesman told foreign reporters that the Japanese army had never damaged any foreign property when counter-attacking Chinese artillery positions in Pudong, but as a result of Chinese artillery bombardment of Hongkou last night, it may change its tactics. The Japanese army will take concrete steps to deal with it, and those steps, which do not necessarily constitute retaliation, are currently under consideration. [Translator's Note: The Japanese are positioning their artillery in Hongkou to bombard our army, but object to our army's bombardment of Hongkou. Only the Japanese are brazen enough to voice such absurd reasoning.]</p>
<p>Our army's heavy artillery heavily bombarded enemy warships and enemy military positions in Hongkou and Yangshupu the night before last. The targets were accurately hit, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. In retaliation, the enemy dispatched three aircraft at approximately 8:00 AM yesterday to conduct low-altitude reconnaissance over our positions in Pudong. At the same time, enemy warships in the Huangpu River simultaneously launched a fierce bombardment of Pudong. The loud rumbling shook the surrounding area. To avoid enemy air strikes, we ignored them completely, and the enemy aircraft gained nothing. Moreover, due to the rain, they left in frustration. Although enemy warships in the Huangpu River continued to bombard Pudong randomly and without targets until noon yesterday, at around 4:00 PM, our army's artillery once again displayed its power, and the enemy warships in the Huangpu River hastily retaliated. At around 5:00 PM, the rain stopped, and six enemy aircraft, divided into two groups, once again became active over Pudong. Our side immediately ceased firing, and the enemy aircraft had no choice but to haphazardly drop over twenty bombs in areas such as Lanni Ferry, Yangjia Ferry, and Tangqiao, destroying many civilian houses. The enemy aircraft flew away with a smug sense of accomplishment in the fading light. At 6:35 PM, enemy warships in the Huangpu River once again launched a senseless bombardment of our Pudong positions, firing a total of over fifty shells until 7:20 PM. When our side continued to ignore them, they stopped on their own accord.</p>
<p>Disregarding International Law, the Enemy Actually Employs Poison Gas Shells</p>
<p>Central News Agency: The enemy is constantly attacking northwest of Luodian, and sometimes approaching our army positions at Shi Xianggong. After our army bravely repelled them, the enemy, due to the heavy losses they suffered, are now disregarding international law and repeatedly employing poison gas shells, fully revealing their brutal and vicious nature. According to a responsible statement issued by our military spokesman, the sneeze gas used by the enemy at Beizhouzhai on the 5th was found to contain toxic substances according to the reports from medical and chemical experts. As a result, of the fifty people exposed to the gas, twenty were diagnosed with symptoms of poisoning, and twenty have already died due to a lack of treatment. Six others are severely poisoned and have no hope of survival. The remaining number are not yet conscious, showing the potency of the gas used by the enemy. On the 6th, the enemy again used poison gas southwest of Luodian, causing over twenty of our soldiers to be severely poisoned.</p>
<p>London, 7th, Havas: The Chinese Embassy has just issued a statement saying, "On the evening of the 4th of this month, when Japanese troops attacked the town of Luodian near Shanghai, the Chinese troops resisted calmly and fiercely. The Japanese troops then used poison gas, causing many Chinese soldiers to be killed and wounded. This matter has now been conclusively proven."</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 8th Dispatch: Relevant parties have just received a telegram from Shanghai stating that last night, when the enemy attacked our Beizhouzhai positions, they released poison gas, and dozens of our defending soldiers were poisoned. Subsequently, our reinforcement units arrived to counterattack and repelled the enemy. The Beizhouzhai positions are currently still in our hands. Furthermore, it has been discovered that the enemy is using illegal Wimu shells in combat in recent days.</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Suzhou, 8th Dispatch: At 7:00 PM on the 4th of this month, the enemy near Luodian used grenade launchers to fire tear gas at our positions. At dawn on the 5th, they released sneeze gas and asphyxiating gas. Twenty or thirty of our defending soldiers were poisoned, all unconscious, vomiting, and unaware of anything. Over twenty of them have already died from poisoning, and the remaining five or six have been rescued and are no longer in danger.</p>
<h3>The National Government Officially Orders the Dismissal and Investigation of Zhang Zizhong</h3>
<p>—Liu Ruming Dismissed But Retained—</p>
<p>[Nanjing] National Government Order on the 8th: This resistance against the enemy is of great importance. We rely entirely on the loyalty and dedication of the generals at the front, who must not fear hardship or danger, to stop the invasion and protect our territory.

<h3>Officers and Soldiers of a British Cruiser are Stopped in Lechang</h3>
<p>[Hankou] A special train carrying 250 officers and sailors from the British cruiser HMS *Kent* to Guangzhou was stopped in Lechang, 140 miles north of Guangzhou, last night due to Japanese aircraft bombing the Yuehan Railway. The railway bureau reported that the railway between Lechang and Guangzhou was damaged by bombs in five locations and will take 24 hours to repair. Therefore, the special train, which was originally expected to arrive in Guangzhou tonight, will be delayed by one day. The British naval authorities have protested to the Japanese authorities. Admiral Hasegawa, commander of the Japanese Third Fleet, replied that even if the British naval personnel were to take other trains, he would guarantee their safe passage. In addition to the British naval personnel, the special train was also carrying Gallaher, the manager of the Hankou HSBC Bank, Mr. and Mrs. Du Usbury, the manager of the Hankou Pharmacy, Hankey, an employee of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, and six missionaries from the Customs, including Dr. Grant, aged 76, his wife, and a 16-year-old child.

<h3>Tax Exemption for Grain Transshipment Unlikely</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] Over ten chambers of commerce and grain industry associations in Shanghai and other places telegraphed the Ministry of Finance requesting an exemption from the grain transshipment tax. The Ministry of Finance stated that in order to cope with the financial situation during this extraordinary period, it has specifically established transshipment tax regulations and collects grain transshipment taxes to make up for the deficit. The merchants and people of the entire country should understand the government's difficulties and sincerely cooperate with the government, fulfilling their responsibilities in this regard. The requested exemption is unlikely to be approved. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>General Anti-Opium Bureau Remains Subordinate to Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] National Government Order on the 8th: The General Anti-Opium Bureau was previously ordered to be transferred to the Executive Yuan, and the Anti-Opium Commissioner was also replaced by the President of the Executive Yuan. According to reports, because the trials of opium cases apply military law, the military judicial organs responsible for handling the review of opium-related cases are also difficult to change in the short term. In order to reduce obstacles in practice and facilitate the promotion of anti-opium policies, it is requested that the transfer not be made. This request is hereby approved. The General Anti-Opium Bureau will remain subordinate to the Military Affairs Commission, and the position of Anti-Opium Commissioner will continue to be held concurrently by the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission.

<h3>Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat in Guoxian, Our Counterattack Recaptures the Position</h3>
<p>The Jinpu Railway Line Sees Two Armies Facing Each Other Across the River; Our Air Force Active on the Pinghan Railway Line</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] The enemy in the suburbs of Guoxian launched a concentrated attack on the northwest of Guoxian on the evening of the 7th, under the cover of intense artillery fire. Our army defended the city, and the artillery fire from both sides was extremely fierce. Later, because a hole was breached in the city wall of Guoxian, Liu Qingkui, the company commander guarding that section, was shot and killed by Commander Wang after he was found to have retreated in fear. This greatly boosted morale. Commander Wang then directed a large-scale counterattack and recaptured the original position. The enemy has now retreated to the suburbs of Guoxian and is mobilizing enemy troops from Yuanping to reinforce them. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] News from the front: Our army has been fighting a desperate battle against the enemy in the Guoxian area for several days. The enemy has suffered heavy casualties, and two of our regiments have also made heroic sacrifices.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Resistance to the End</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>At the same time as the League of Nations took steps to condemn aggressor nations, US President Roosevelt delivered an astonishingly great speech. Subsequently, the US State Department declared Japan an aggressor nation. As a result, global public opinion responded enthusiastically. This unfolding of a favorable international situation is clearly the result of our nation's heroic spirit of resistance. At the same time, it can further ignite our spirit of resistance.</p>
<p>Our China 'possesses unlimited capacity for resistance' and is gaining powerful international support. Victory in the war of resistance can be ensured. The only question is whether our compatriots nationwide can resist to the end.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang recently expressed his thoughts on President Roosevelt's speech, saying, 'We are currently struggling and will continue to struggle in order to achieve the complete withdrawal of Japanese troops, so that we can continue our peaceful construction plan. Our determination to defend ourselves remains consistent. Even if we fight to the last soldier and the last inch of territory, we will not change our original intention in the slightest. We will not stop resisting until justice is established and the sanctity of treaties is restored.'</p>
<p>This powerful statement once again demonstrates to the world that our compatriots nationwide are resolved to resist to the end. Any attempt by the international community to force China down a path of humiliating compromise should be thoroughly eliminated from now on.</p>

<h3>City to Enthusiastically Celebrate National Day Tomorrow</h3>
<p>All to celebrate by raising flags in place, and to independently assist by taking practical steps to defeat the enemy</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the 26th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. At this extraordinary time, looking back on the hardships faced by the martyrs in establishing the nation, the significance of commemoration is greatly increased. The City Party Headquarters has therefore formulated commemoration measures. The City Chamber of Commerce has issued a notice to celebrate by raising flags, the Anti-Enemy Association is making every effort to publicize the event, and various groups are setting out to conduct publicity and provide comfort. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Formulates Commemoration Measures</p>
<p>The City Party Headquarters issued a notice saying: "For the purpose of notification, the following measures are formulated to celebrate this year's Double Ten National Day commemoration: (1) All agencies, groups, schools, factories, shops, and households in the city shall celebrate by raising flags.

(3) At 12:00 noon on this day, the association will send personnel to lead citizens in chanting 'Long live' three times at the radio station (Long live the Three Principles of the People, Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party, Long live the Republic of China) to express their celebration. It is hoped that all agencies, groups, schools, factories, shops, and citizens in the city will follow these instructions."</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Notifies Flag-Raising Celebration</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce issued a notice saying, "October 10 is the anniversary of the founding of the Republic of China. Looking back on the hardships of the revolutionary martyrs in establishing the nation, and the heroic courage of the soldiers on the front lines who shed blood to defend the country today, all of our compatriots should increase their devotion to this Double Ten Festival and offer their protection. Therefore, an urgent notice is hereby issued to all factories and shops in the city: on this day, the national flag shall be uniformly raised; all freight trucks, private cars, and rental cars shall also uniformly display the national flag to show the utmost sincerity in cherishing the nation."</p>
<p>Anti-Enemy Association Issues Publicity Outline</p>
<p>The Propaganda Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association yesterday released a publicity outline for the National Day commemoration: (1) The significance of this year's National Day commemoration: A. The united front of the Chinese nation has been strengthened due to the all-out war of resistance. B. 'Supporting the government, trusting the leader, sacrificing everything, and resisting to the end' has become the unanimous position of the people nationwide. C. Regardless of north or south, man or woman, old or young, all are fighting for the freedom and equality of China. D. The old accounts of historical humiliation have begun to be settled in this year's National Day commemoration. E. China's strength in the war of resistance has been fully demonstrated through the unity of the military and the people. F. This year's National Day commemoration marks the starting point for peaceful forces to resist aggressor forces. G. This year's National Day commemoration has closely linked China with peace-loving and just countries and peoples around the world, giving a serious blow to aggressors. H. This year's National Day commemoration has revealed the dawn of China's national rejuvenation. I. This year's National Day commemoration has grasped the future of victory in the war of resistance. J. This year's National Day is a day of commemoration that advances on the blood of revolutionary martyrs. (2) How we commemorate this year's National Day: A. Economic boycott of Japan. B. Encouraging the purchase of national salvation public bonds. C. Comforting the soldiers on the front lines. Finally, it is hoped that all sectors of the city, shops, and residents will uniformly display the national flag on this day to show their celebration. In the past, during each festival holiday, a small number of shops and residents in the concession areas often remained indifferent, as if they were outside the pale of civilization, which was not as it should be. This National Day commemoration, in the midst of the all-out war of resistance, has profound significance and should be unanimously celebrated, so as to eliminate the shortcomings of the past.</p>

Now, in response to the letter from the Anti-Enemy Support Association, a systematic overview of the relief work is required. It has now been sent to press and will be distributed for reference. Once the proofreading is accurate, it will be officially released. Mr. Pan asked for corrections and criticisms on the various processes of running the relief effort. The refugees who have been accommodated have all been sent to various places. Most of the refugees remaining in Shanghai are from Jiatai Bao and other places, because the refugees in those places have no homes to return to. The association has provided appropriate education to the young refugees and divided the adult refugees into technical and ordinary categories. Technical workers are given appropriate work, and in addition to assisting in various military works in the rear, ordinary workers are also planning to accept suggestions from various parties and give them the opportunity to reproduce. At the same time, it is hoped that all sectors will contribute opinions on how to deal with refugees for adoption. Subsequently, Qu Shao Yi delivered a speech on behalf of the press.

<h3>British Prime Minister Chamberlain's Speech Responds to the U.S. President's Speech</h3>
<p>Cooperating with Each Other, Striving for Peace Appeal, The British Government is Willing to Support it with All its Strength</p>
<p>[London] British Prime Minister Chamberlain said in a speech to the Conservative Party Congress in Scarborough today that President Roosevelt's remarks in Chicago regarding the dignity of treaties not only expressed the confidence of the United States, but also represented the views of Britain. President Roosevelt's remarks were timely, arousing widespread response, and are welcome. In the past, it was generally believed that the United States, the world's strongest country, would always be content with its isolationist policy. However, President Roosevelt now clearly understands that, as he said in Chicago, if the plague that destroys the laws of the world is allowed to spread, no country can escape its infringement. President Roosevelt's statement that it is necessary to restore the credibility of promises and the dignity of treaties represents not only the opinion of the United States, but also the opinion of Britain. The British government is willing to support its call to cooperate with each other in striving for peace with all its strength. At the beginning of his speech, Chamberlain praised Foreign Secretary Eden, saying that none of the government officials worked as hard as Eden. Eden, young and capable, with extremely rich experience, is using his talents and skills to maintain peace and safeguard national interests. The country is fortunate to have such a statesman. Chamberlain then mentioned the wars in China and Spain, saying that it is heartbreaking to use airplanes to bomb non-combatant men, women, children, and infants. However, in the natural indignation caused by this kind of action, one point may be overlooked. What is this point? That is, brutality, barbarism, the death of civilians, hunger, and suffering are inevitable consequences of modern warfare. The true crime against humanity lies in not trying to resolve disputes through peaceful discussion, but in destroying dignified treaties and resorting to force. Speaking of the Far East incident, the League of Nations Assembly has now launched a conference of signatory countries to the Nine-Power Treaty and other countries with interests in the Far East. After President Roosevelt's speech, there is no doubt that the United States is willing to participate in this conference and discuss with other countries how to stop the Sino-Japanese conflict. It is still too early to say what special actions the British government will take, but its purpose is to restore peace and maintain it. The British government is willing to cooperate with any useful method to achieve this goal. Chamberlain's remarks about China attracted much attention. The Prime Minister then spoke of other things, concluding by saying that the tragedies that China has today have made us understand that our security in avoiding such tragedies is more precious than anything else.

<h3>Britain and the United States Begin Preliminary Talks on Convening the Nine-Power Treaty Conference</h3>

Undersecretary of State Welles has stated to the British Charge d'Affaires that the United States will definitely participate in the Nine-Power Conference.

According to State Department officials, consideration was given to convening a special session of Congress and the US's diplomatic policy towards the Sino-Japanese situation. As for whether the powers will be asked to unanimously declare economic sanctions against Japan, this is still a matter of general speculation. The highest administrative authorities have now denied rumors that the United States intends to greatly increase its military buildup program. (8th Central News Agency Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>US President Arrives in Washington</h3>
<p>Summons Hull and Others to Discuss the Situation</p>

When meeting with newspaper reporters, the President refused to comment on the international situation. When asked whether the future meeting of the signatories to the Nine-Power Treaty would be held in Washington, he did not answer. Secretary of State Hull later told newspaper reporters that he and the President had discussed general international issues. Regarding the convening of the Nine-Power Treaty Conference, the League of Nations has not yet sent an invitation to the United States, so there is nothing to announce at this time. In addition, State Department Assistant Wilson met with British Charge d'Affaires Mallet in the afternoon to discuss the preparations for the Nine-Power Treaty Conference.

<h3>British Labour Party Supports Government's Rearmament Program</h3>
<p>Passed at General Assembly</p>
<p>[London] At the Bournemouth Labour Party Congress held today, the Executive Committee presented a report on international policy and defense, advocating support for the British rearmament program passed by the previous Trades Union Congress. Former opposition leader Ramsay MacDonald vehemently opposed it, while Lord Ponsonby and one or two other representatives spoke in support. MacDonald, a staunch pacifist, was praised by the representatives for his personal sincerity. Subsequently, former Home Secretary Clynes expressed his views, which can be regarded as the will of the entire Labour Party. Clynes stated that the main purpose of the report was to ensure that when the Labour Party next comes to power, it has a strong military force to defend the country in the current state of the world. This is truly for the benefit of the working class and the entire nation, and the Labour Party cannot remain inactive, only to engage in rearmament after an attack has occurred. The Labour Party dare not decide the danger of fascist countries attacking democratic Britain. Afterwards, the report was put to a vote, with 2,169,000 votes in favor and only 262,000 votes against. Before the vote, the Congress had rejected, by a similar majority, a motion requiring Labour MPs to vote against the defense budget. Finally, Dallas, Chairman of the National Labour Party's Agriculture and Rural Issues Committee, was elected Chairman of the Labour Party's National Executive Committee, replacing Dalton, and Mrs. Gould was elected Vice-Chairman.

<h3>Our Guerrilla Forces Harass Enemy Rear, Enemy Retreats North of Yellow River Cliff Station</h3>
<p>Rumor of Flanking Attack by a Certain Unit, Claim of Recovering Dezhou Yesterday</p>
<p>[Jinan] Our guerrilla forces harassed the enemy's rear, and a large number of reinforcements arrived, causing great fear to the enemy. Yesterday, they retreated north of Yellow River Cliff Station. The front line is quiet. Our armored vehicles are stationed north of Pingyuan Station, awaiting orders to advance. (9th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>[Jinan] Military News: The remnants of the enemy on the Jinpu Railway are still on the north bank of the Old Yellow River, constantly attacking our positions, but they have all been repelled. Our guerrilla forces have bypassed to the far rear of the enemy. This afternoon, two enemy planes flew to Jinning and strafed our airfield, dropping two bombs without causing any damage. In the evening, it was rumored that a certain unit of our army launched a flanking attack, with claims of recovering Dezhou. (8th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Davis Arrives in Washington, D.C.</h3>
<p>[Washington, D.C.] Mr. Davis, an important American figure who has repeatedly served as a U.S. special envoy and participated in various European conferences, was urgently summoned from New York to Washington, D.C., and arrived here this morning. He will consult with President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull on all matters. It is reported that they will discuss ways for the United States to participate in the Nine-Power Conference.

<h3>Enemy Recruits Our Compatriots for Military Service through Bribery</h3>
<p>Discovered in All Frontline Battles</p>
<p>[Nanjing] According to reports from various sources, the enemy fighting against us on the front lines, in addition to the puppet Manchukuo troops, also includes many of our compatriots. Upon investigation, it was found that the enemy previously used the name of recruiting Chinese laborers to gather unemployed or demobilized soldiers in various places at high prices and send them to the Northeast for organization. This time, they were driven to Shanghai to fight, under strict enemy surveillance. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>A Certain Military Expert Discusses Western Front Operations</h3>
<p>Determined to Improve Past Mistakes, Shanxi-North Battles Will Have a New Posture</p>
<p>[Taiyuan] A Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed a certain military expert here to discuss the progress of the Western Front operations. The expert expressed his opinion that since the outbreak of the Western Front battles, our army has always been in a disadvantageous position. The reason for this, as Commander Yan has openly stated, is that the enemy is on the offensive, while our army is on the defensive. Therefore, we are constantly restrained by the enemy, and most of our army's fighting power is consumed in responding, which is a regrettable matter. If our army were to change its position and take the offensive, even if we might not be assured of victory, the enemy would at least have to divide their forces to respond to us, and the situation in northern Shanxi might not be what it is today. The expert continued that the authorities have a deep understanding and awareness of this point, and are determined to improve past mistakes. They have also agreed on a new strategy, and as soon as the newly added troops on the front line are deployed, they will implement it according to the new plan. The battles in northern Shanxi will soon have a new posture, and we can wait and see. (Central News Agency, 8th)</p>
<h3>Enemy Attacks Guangfu Town, Repelled; Fierce Fighting Continues Southwest of Liuhang</h3>
<p>Intense Struggle between the Two Armies for the Xiliufangzhai Position; Shixianggong Temple Area Still Held by Our Army; Enemy Remnants Crossing Yunzaobang Trapped in Dire Straits</p>
<p>Continuous heavy rain allowed our army to launch a counterattack, which was extremely successful. In addition, our heavy artillery team fired accurately, repeatedly hitting enemy military strongholds, further causing the enemy to panic. The following is the front-line report received by this newspaper at 2:00 PM today: ❶ West of Luodian, the enemy and we are still in a stalemate near Shixianggong Temple, and enemy reinforcements have repeatedly launched attacks, all of which have been repelled. ❷ The enemy launched a multi-pronged attack on our Guangfu Town position, and their regimental headquarters even stationed in Liangtang to supervise the battle. We calmly killed the enemy, and the front line did not move. ❸ The enemy and we are fiercely contesting Xiliufangzhai on the north bank of the Yunzaobang, southwest of Liuhang, and are still in fierce fighting. ❹ The enemy remnants who crossed the Yunzaobang are surrounded and severely attacked by our army, trapped on the bank, with no possibility of development. ❺ There has been no major contact between Jiangwan and Zhabei since last night and this afternoon. Small units of the enemy that harassed us were all annihilated.</p>
<h3>Enemy Troops Fiercely Attack Xiliufangzhai on the North Bank of the Yunzaobang, Southwest of Liuhang</h3>
<p>Once Breached, but Quickly Recaptured by Our Army; Intruded Again Last Night and are Currently Being Blocked; Enemy Attack on Xinmu Bridge Repelled</p>
<p>Southwest of Liuhang, the enemy's 9th Division fiercely attacked our army's Xiliufangzhai position west of Tangqiao Station, attempting to echo the enemy remnants on the south bank of the Yunzaobang. The attack was particularly fierce starting at dawn yesterday. Although under heavy rain, the artillery fire continued all day long, destroying our army's position. Our army calmly responded and firmly defended, but because the position was destroyed too much, it was breached. At noon yesterday, our army's fresh troops arrived and jointly launched a counterattack, advancing in the rain. Although the enemy's artillery fire was dense, our entire army fought bravely, rising one after another. After several hours of bloody battle, the original position was completely restored. In the evening, the defeated enemy, with reinforcements, attacked our army's position again, and the bloody battle resumed. However, the previous fortifications had already been destroyed, making it difficult to defend, so it was breached again for the second time. Our rear troops rushed to intercept and annihilated most of the attacking enemy. Until this morning, the two sides were still in intense fighting, and the struggle was extremely fierce. The intruding enemy is west of Liuhang. On our army's Guangfu Town Xinmu Bridge line of defence a large contingent of enemy troops launched fierce attacks yesterday, with incessant artillery fire throughout the day in the heavy rain, covering their troops' advance. Our army fought bravely, and the attacking enemy was never successful, suffering heavy casualties and collapsing in defeat. This morning, the enemy attempted to attack again, but was still driven away by our army.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:20 PM on the 9th that the enemy at Heida Huangzhai, west of the highway on the south bank of the Yunzaobang, is currently resisting stubbornly behind the river after being surrounded and attacked by our forces, attempting to prolong their survival. This morning, before dawn, a force suddenly rushed eastward to expand its position, but after our strict blockade, the enemy's plan has been dashed.</p>
<h3>Enemy Remnants' Retreat Route Cut Off</h3>
<p>The focus of the battle is currently developing east and west of Liuhang along the Shanghai-Taicang Road Tangqiao. Although the enemy troops who crossed south near Tangqiao have been almost completely annihilated by our forces, the enemy's ambition has not died. Even this morning, despite the rain, they are still constantly building bridges to cross secretly. Our army showed great power in the middle of the night, advancing fiercely on three sides along the bank, completely destroying the enemy's temporary fortifications on the north bank. With their retreat route cut off, the enemy did not dare to continue advancing.</p>
<h3>Enemy Attack on Zhabei Suffers Another Heavy Blow</h3>
<p>Repeated Attacks on Baziqiao Sanyili Unsuccessful</p>
<p>The enemy at Huayuanli 63 of North Sichuan Road and the Japanese Cemetery, after attacking our Zhabei positions in the past two days and being routed by our army's ambush, still had not given up their ambition. Yesterday evening, the enemy again launched several attacks on our Baziqiao and Sanyili areas north of the Dongbaoxing Road Railway, all of which were met with a head-on blow from our army. Not only did the stubborn enemy make no progress, but they also suffered heavy casualties. This morning, the two sides continued artillery fire on that front until noon.</p>
<p>The recent battles in the Jiangwan area have been relatively quiet. Since the enemy withdrew their heavy troops from that front, they have only been coveting the Yejia Garden line. Since the evening of the 6th, they have occasionally harassed us. Our army calmly responded, pursuing and killing the enemy as soon as they came. As of press time, there was no sign of the enemy. Also, in the Jiangwan Racecourse area, the enemy occasionally sends small guerrilla units, in groups of ten or more, to drive our Northeastern compatriots to probe our defenses and fortifications. After our army discovered this, they immediately pursued and attacked them. Since last night, with the continuous autumn rain, it has been very quiet.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:20 PM on the 9th that our army's警戒 line in the Jiangwan area is frequently pushing forward, and is very close to the enemy's positions. The enemy's movements are clearly visible. From last night to this morning, both sides have been lying in wait behind their defenses, constantly firing at each other from within their positions. The sound of gunfire rises and falls intermittently, but there are no fierce battles. There is occasional shelling in the Zhabei area.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:10 PM on the 9th that at around 3:00 AM this morning (9th), the enemy attacked Yicun, five zhang east of Guangdong Street, with a company. After three hours of intense fighting, the enemy suffered more than 50 casualties and had one tank destroyed, and finally retreated in defeat at around 6:00 AM. Also, two enemy companies, starting at 1:30 AM, reconnoitered our Baziqiao position from Huayuanli 63 and the Japanese Cemetery. Our army divided its forces and ambushed from two directions, inflicting more than 30 casualties on the enemy, and also drove them back at around 4:00 AM.</p>
<p>A Central News Agency correspondent with the army reported at 12:10 PM on the 9th that at 8:00 PM last night, the enemy army attacked our position at Hejiaxiang Municipal Cemetery from the Si Jingqiu Field in Jiangwan. Due to the unfavorable situation, they retreated immediately. Later, at 1:30 AM this morning, they launched a reinforced attack, and after four hours of intense fighting, the enemy suffered more than 120 casualties and had one tank destroyed, and retreated in a disheveled manner.</p>
<h3>Enemy Seizes and Confiscates Private Property</h3>
<p>Areas Such as Hongkou in East Shanghai, Loaded into 3,000 Boxes and Shipped Back to Japan</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, the property of our residents living in the Hongkou and Yangshupu areas of East Shanghai could not be evacuated in time. The enemy not only refused to allow us to move it, but also proceeded to seize and confiscate all of our property. In addition to food and other items that could be used for military purposes being used locally, all of our small industrial machinery, hardware parts, and other metal products in that area were all looted and loaded into more than 3,000 boxes, which were transported to Japan by the enemy transport ship Noiima at around 3:00 PM yesterday (8th).</p>
<h3>Temporary Silence on the Pudong Front</h3>
<p>Our Pudong artillery displayed fierce firepower the night before last and yesterday morning, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy's reinforcements. Fearing another bombing by us, the enemy on the other side was extremely panicked. After 7:00 PM last night, the ships in the Huangpu River continued to fire intermittently, reaching two or thirty rounds, and stopped only after seeing no movement. However, every half hour, they would use machine guns to strafe the banks of the Huangpu River to prevent our army from attacking, so the clear sound of machine guns in the Huangpu River could be heard all night long. The state of their panic can be seen from this. Today, from morning to noon, the autumn rain has been incessant, and the entire Pudong front is unusually silent, having entered a state of truce.</p>

<h3>Trivia</h3>
<p>—Phase</p>
<p>Today is October 9th. It is the day before the Double Tenth National Day. Originally, today should be spent happily preparing for the celebration. However, this year we are being invaded by the violent Japanese and are in a period of determined resistance. Let's put the celebration aside for now. Let's take the spirit of preparing for National Day and use it to resist the enemy. Let's take the money to prepare for the celebration and use it to resist the enemy.</p>
<p>National Day is like a person's birthday. This year is the 26th, not a round number. And in this extraordinary period, we should naturally keep things simple and economical. We should use the attitude of "lying on firewood and tasting gall" and the spirit of "sleeping on spears and waiting for dawn" to desperately drive the enemy out of our national defense line. It is not too late to have a very glorious and solemn celebration next year.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Registration Office for Chinese Employees Retiring from Japanese Banks</h3>
<p>Having Personally Experienced the Oppression of the Japanese, the Anti-Japanese Sentiment is Even Stronger; Who Doesn't Find it Intolerable to Still Be Employed by the Enemy?</p>
<p>(Special Feature by this Newspaper) After the July 8th Lugou Bridge Incident, Chinese employees of Japanese commercial banks in Shanghai, including Chosen, Taiwan, Seisho, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and major business companies and spinning mills, resigned one after another to show their determination to resist the enemy. According to newspaper reports on August 4th, "more than 260 people have resigned, especially management-level talents." After the outbreak of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War, it can be said that all Chinese employees of all Japanese commercial banks, companies, and factories have automatically resigned. Although this number has not been statistically calculated, it must be quite large. So, how are these unemployed people living now? This is something we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Regarding the unemployed workers of various spinning mills and the retired employees of various Japanese trading companies, formal agencies have been handling registration procedures separately. Now, the "Shanghai Silver and Money Trade Association" is also handling registration procedures for Chinese employees retiring from Japanese banks at No. 542, Lane 5, Xiafei Road (next door to the Paris Grand Theatre). To learn more about the situation, the reporter made a special visit there yesterday.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shao and Mr. Han, the persons in charge of the association, it is their unshirkable duty to handle the registration of Chinese employees retiring from Japanese banks "for the sake of colleagues" and the future of this war of resistance. However, due to other reasons, the process has been delayed until now. As for the aftercare issues for these retiring employees, after the registration and statistics are completed, a mutual aid and exchange association (name not yet determined) will be temporarily established, and they will jointly discuss all wartime economic issues. Because they have all personally experienced the oppression of the Japanese, their anti-Japanese sentiment must be very high, and their will must be very firm. Moreover, many of them are "management personnel," and they can learn more about Japan's economic situation in Shanghai. Then, they will try to introduce them to jobs—this issue is indeed too difficult, but they will work hard to do it.</p>
<p>In addition to the name, place of origin, age, and contact address, the registration form also includes the following two items: ❶ Name of the original serving bank, address of the original serving bank, whether there is a current job, and when is available; ❷ What special skills do you have, what kind of work do you want to do, how do you hope the association can help, what are your feelings about the original serving bank, and what are your feelings about this war of resistance? When the reporter went there, he happened to meet two Chinese employees retiring from a Japanese bank who were filling out the registration form. They were trainees at a certain Japanese bank, so they had a brief conversation with them.</p>
<p>According to the two of them, since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, all Chinese employees of Mitsubishi and Mitsui have withdrawn. Although Seisho, Taiwan, Chosen, and Sumitomo are still operating as usual, only one or two out of ten Chinese clerks remain. They are all trapped in a dilemma for the sake of livelihood. This situation deserves our pity and sympathy. Therefore, it is imperative to handle the registration. Even if we cannot immediately introduce them to jobs, we need talents everywhere in the long-term war of resistance. Their efforts are known when compatriots who have personally experienced the oppression of the Japanese come to do anti-Japanese work. And I can say with certainty that they—everyone—is willing to do their last bit for the country. Now, these compatriots who have not retired are even lodging in the bank. From this, it can be known that their homes may have been destroyed by artillery fire and have nowhere to live; or they may feel ashamed that they are still employed by the enemy and are unwilling to show their faces. But can they endure this way? Our answer is: "Absolutely not!" And we also sincerely await them to give themselves to the great cause of the nation!</p>
<p>Most of the expenses for Japan's invasion of Shanghai this time are negotiated and paid by Japanese commercial banks, calculated in Shanghai currency, and remitted to Citibank and HSBC. The special affairs expenditure is absolutely confidential, and Chinese employees of course have no way of knowing. Some of the Japanese employees of the Yokohama Specie Bank have been recalled to their country to participate in the Kanazawa Division Detachment to fight in Shanghai. What do these Japanese people, who also love peace with us, think when they are fighting with their lives on the battlefield?</p>
<p>Finally, he also told the reporter that four important Japanese military personnel lived on the upper floor of a certain bank, and Chinese employees were of course absolutely not allowed to go up there.</p>
<p>At a time when the soldiers on the front lines are sacrificing their lives for the country, the people in the rear can actively express their determination to resist the enemy. The final victory of this spirit of military-civilian cooperation will soon be proven by facts. (Ping)</p>
<h3>The People Enthusiastically Console the Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Sufficient to Demonstrate the Value of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Consolation Committee has established a wounded soldier consolation group at Room 418, Zhonghui Building, Aidoa Road (telephone 85439) to facilitate the people's consolation of the wounded soldiers and to prevent unscrupulous people from taking advantage of the opportunity to inquire about military information. It has also consulted with various wounded soldier hospitals to hire enthusiastic ladies to serve as commissioners, stationed in various hospitals to receive condolences from all walks of life. The number of people who have come to offer condolences and apply for regular visits has been very enthusiastic. The groups that have already offered condolences include the Shanghai Islamic Association, the Drama Circle National Salvation Association, the 12th National Salvation Performing Troupe, and the 13th National Salvation Performing Troupe. The groups scheduled to visit various hospitals tomorrow, National Day, include the Shanghai Municipal Local Association, the Shanghai Municipal Vocational Circle National Salvation Association, the Foreign Firm Chinese Staff Association, the Shanghai YMCA, the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Women's Consolation of Anti-Japanese and Self-Defense Soldiers Association, the Women's Movement Promotion Association, the Chinese Women's Society, the Shanghai Education Circle Wartime Service Corps, the Shanghai University Students' Friendship Association, and Ms. Liu Jun'e and Ms. Hu. This kind of enthusiasm for comforting the wounded soldiers is sufficient to demonstrate the value of the national war of resistance. If the wounded soldiers return to the front line and convey the feelings of the people in the rear, they will surely increase the morale of the front line.</p>
<h3>Westerner Talks About Our Wounded Soldiers Yearning for War News</h3>
<p>The North-China Daily News yesterday published a letter from a Westerner, Mr. Stirling, stating that after a foreigner visited one of the Chinese wounded soldier hospitals, he brought news that one of the things the wounded soldiers felt most lacking was news from the front. I believe that many Chinese young ladies in Shanghai, knowing that the wounded soldiers are eager to know the progress of the war on all fronts at any time, will be willing to come out to help. Now, if several copies of newspapers are sent to various hospitals twice a day for the wounded soldiers to read, this kind of sacrifice is not too great. I dare to say that they are still able to take on this task at this time. Translator's note: Although this is a small matter, it is enough to show Mr. Stirling's concern for the lives of our country's loyal and brave soldiers. I hope that the young ladies will immediately take action and not disappoint Mr. Stirling's good intentions in writing the letter.</p>
<h3>Cotton Vests</h3>
<p>People from All Regions Enthusiastically Donate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Consolation Committee recently received 390 cotton vests raised by the town head Huang Zhongqing from all walks of life in Yexie Town, Sixth District, Songjiang County, packed into six large packages, and sent to Shanghai by Jiang Shuisheng and Han Dashi. In addition, Chen Peide, Mrs. Mo Shangqing, and Xinyi Company each donated 100 pieces, and Zhu Gengxin donated 50 pieces. It is now heard that in order to make it easier to collect the quota of one million pieces, if commissioned to produce them in other places, each piece will be charged 6 jiao, 5 fen and 5 li in national currency. If commissioned to handle the donation of first aid kits for the soldiers, each kit will be charged 1 jiao in national currency. They can be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on Yu Qiaqing Road in Shanghai, or to the Shanghai Municipal Local Association in the Zhonghui Building on Aidoa Road.</p>
<p>The faculty and staff of Zhengshi Middle School on Shanzhong Road in this city believe that since it is late autumn, the soldiers on the front line should be consoled because they are eating wind and dew and fighting bloody battles. Therefore, the dean of teaching, Yu Xiangsen, initiated the fundraising for cotton vests. With the enthusiastic donations of the faculty and staff, 400 pieces were raised in one day and will soon be entrusted to the local association to be sent to the front. It is heard that many foreign teachers in the school also gladly donated, showing that foreign friends also sympathize with our loyal and brave soldiers.</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Consolation Committee launched the fundraising for cotton vests to keep the front-line soldiers warm, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have been sewing and donating them. The entire Chinese staff of the Jardine Matheson Tug &amp; Lighter Company on the Bund in the French Concession specially donated 260 cotton vests, which were delivered to the local association yesterday for transfer. It is hoped that the Chinese staff of other foreign firms in this city will follow suit and donate.</p>
<p>The students of Shanghai Municipal He'an Elementary School initiated saving sugar expenses to save the country after the outbreak of the Sui War, and raised a total of 479 yuan, 7 jiao and 6 fen. When the Lugou Bridge Incident occurred, it was remitted to the front, but it was unexpectedly rejected and returned. Now, this money will be used to purchase cotton cloth and flowered clothes, which will be brought back by the students and asked their parents to sew 548 cotton vests to be delivered to the Shanghai Municipal Local Association to be transported to the front on Double Tenth to comfort the soldiers and express their respect.</p>
<h3>Famous Courtesans of the Northern District Broadcast Fundraising</h3>
<p>Relief, Rescue and Comfort - Initiated by the Zheng Yun Fellowship</p>
<p>Mr. Ji Chun Tang, Mr. Cheng Jian Han, Mr. Wang Zi Xian, and others from the Zheng Yun Fellowship of this city, are now planning to collaborate with the sisters of the Northern District to initiate a broadcast fundraising campaign to provide relief to refugees, rescue wounded soldiers, and comfort the soldiers at the front. The Relief Committee has already approved this initiative. The broadcast date and radio station address will be announced later upon designation. Now, we first publicly announce the names of the enthusiastic and famous courtesans of the Northern District who will participate: Miss 卿卿 Sixth, Miss 卿卿 Seventh, Yue E, Yue Hua, Yin Hua, Ying Hua, Xue Zhu, Xiao Mei Mei, Miao Zhen, Hua Qun Fang, Xin Tan Chun, Wen Juan, Xin Yue, Li 卿, Xiao Chou, Yuan Chun, Ying Xue, Li Xiang Jun, San Mei Mei, Zhen Huan Lü Hong, Zhen Ming Yue, Jin Yu Lou, Qing Mei, Qin Xin, Qin Di, Di Di, Ping Hu Di Di, Li Wen, Qin Fang, Zhang Su Zhen, Miss Wang Jiu, Ma Li Lian, etc. Others who have not yet joined will be announced one day before the broadcast.

When donating, please specify whether the donation is for relief, rescue, or comfort, so that we can distribute it accordingly.</p>
<h3>Commercial Press Celebrates National Day by Comforting Soldiers</h3>
<p>The Commercial Press will, as usual, be closed for one day on National Day. However, as this day falls on a Sunday, according to regulations, a compensatory day off should originally be given on the 11th. However, due to the current national resistance period, and the need to make extra efforts in culture, it has been decided that work will continue as usual on the 11th. All wages that should be compensated to employees for one day will be fully used to comfort the soldiers at the front. The sum of one thousand national currency has already been sent to the Shanghai Comfort Committee today. The balance will be settled when salaries are paid in the future, and any remaining amount will be sent as a supplement. The fact that the company is contributing money and the employees are contributing labor deeply aligns with the meaning of concerted national salvation. All sectors will surely be inspired upon hearing this.</p>
<h3>The Anti-Enemy Association's Design Committee Continues Talent Registration</h3>
<p>In order to meet the needs of all sectors, the Design Committee of the Shanghai All-Circles Anti-Enemy Support Association has specifically organized the registration of specialized talents. For a month now, specialized talents from all walks of life have been eagerly registering. Among the registered talents, there are quite a few who have been introduced by the association and found work. Now, in response to the demands for talent from all sectors, the association has decided to continue to organize this registration. A temporary registration office has been set up at No. 142, Lane 3, Ci Hou Nan Li, Hartung Road. The time is from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM every day.</p>
<h3>Inland Cotton Mills Need Several Thousand Workers</h3>
<p>Same treatment as in Shanghai - Can register at the Cotton Mill Workers' Association</p>
<p>The Cotton Mill Workers' National Salvation Association has received requests from factories in various regions, requiring several thousand male and female workers. It is hoped that all male and female workers will quickly register with the association, and then be escorted by the association to work inland. The treatment is the same as in Shanghai. The association will find ways to provide relief to family members. Those who wish to go with the workers are also welcome. Displaced workers in the Eastern Shanghai area can register with the association. The association has a shelter specifically for cotton mill workers. The general headquarters is located at No. 24, Fuxing Village, Lane, Huxi New Stage, the intersection of Laobiesheng Road and Jiaozhou Road. The Eastern District branch is located at No. 37, Sanhe Li, Xiaoshadu Road, Binlang Road.</p>

<h3>Four Points That the Public Should Pay Attention To</h3>
<p>— Ya Lu</p>
<p>We can only survive in the War of Resistance, which is something everyone should know. In the Battle of Shanghai, the enemy army not only failed to gain any advantage strategically, but also suffered significant damage from our army. This strengthens our conviction that only through long-term struggle can we achieve final victory. All previous unhealthy mentalities such as hope, reliance, timidity, and fear of Japan should be completely eradicated. Although our public does not yet need to go to the battlefield to kill enemies, in this extraordinary period, the public in the rear should also live a disciplined life like in the army, and work hard in their respective positions to contribute to the country. I believe that at a minimum, the following four points should be implemented:</p>
<p>㊀ Thrift: In normal times, everyone only knows how to consume and lacks the intelligence of new production. Therefore, social extravagance has become a universal trend, which is truly heartbreaking. Now that the country is resisting the enemy, the people should be awakened. Moreover, military supplies and other application materials are very important in the war of resistance. Our public should reduce clothing and food expenses and use the remaining funds to support the country in order to increase the effect of killing the enemy. This is the national salvation spirit that the public should have.</p>
<p>㊁ Diligence: An ancient saying goes, "The people's livelihood has diligence, and diligence will not be lacking." In this long-term struggle, farmers and workers are directly engaged in production, and they should intensify their work to increase production, so that necessary needs are continuously available. Even other indirect production occupations should also be spirited and diligently serve. As for those who have already lost their jobs, they should quickly find opportunities inland. Whether doing labor or farming, there is room for development, and it is especially hoped that groups and organizations will provide them with various conveniences and assistance. In this way, everyone can get the opportunity to be diligent, and the economic structure will definitely be very solid.</p>
<p>㊂ Patience: To demand national survival, considerable sacrifices must be made. Now that the soldiers defending the country have already given their lives on the battlefield, then we, the public, should also endure some mental suffering and material losses. We must know that material losses can be compensated for in the future, but if we become slaves of the enemy, then we will never be able to turn over for generations. Therefore, during wartime, we should all grit our teeth and be extremely patient in order to gain national survival and future happiness.</p>
<p>㊃ Assistance: As the saying goes, "Many hands make light work." A big thing cannot be accomplished by one person, and it must be done with everyone working together with one heart. It is certainly the soldiers' duty to resist the enemy at the front, but it is our public's obligation to provide support in the rear. Because the military and the people can cooperate with each other, we can strengthen morale and consolidate military hearts. As for relief to refugees, development of agriculture and industry, and other work that is beneficial to resisting the enemy, we should all rise up and give play to the spirit of assistance.</p>
<p>The above four points, although they are clichés, I think they are very important in resisting the enemy. Therefore, without avoiding my own insignificance, I hope that everyone will earnestly do them and give the country unlimited prospects.
